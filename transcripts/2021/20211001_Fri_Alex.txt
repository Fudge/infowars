[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:07.403]  We have, again, every day I come on air, it's a bigger day than the previous day, with the COVID-19 martial law takeover.
[00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:08.304]  We got all that news.
[00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:09.286]  Congress.
[00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:23.897]  The judicial branch, the White House staff, the CDC, the FDA, the USPS, NIAID, Pfizer and Moderna are all exempt from forced inoculations, but they want to make you be forced to take it.
[00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:29.220]  Dianne Feinstein introduces a bill to require a COVID vaccine in order to fly domestically, but she's exempt.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.520]  I mean, you talk about discrimination.
[00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:38.084]  Oh, meanwhile, Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug that's suspiciously similar to ivermectin.
[00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:39.725]  They're just changing the molecule a little.
[00:00:41.263 --> 00:00:45.668]  Saying, oh, the new pill you'll take daily to stop COVID is... Ivermectin.
[00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.610]  Yep.
[00:00:49.072 --> 00:00:49.312]  Wow.
[00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:56.411]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:56.411 --> 00:01:12.412]   Many are now awakened to the harsh reality of depopulation and democide, which we find ourselves in today.
[00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:14.763]  And the endgame is out in the open.
[00:01:15.523 --> 00:01:19.484]  To destroy humanity under the guise of transhumanism.
[00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:28.727]  What we've unfortunately learned is that there is an overwhelming herd of us who will do whatever they are told by the system.
[00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:32.128]  Which explains how we've gotten this far.
[00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:42.149]  There are seemingly millions who will believe whatever pop culture tells them, including the mass denial of natural health and immunity.
[00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:56.155]  While attempting to criminalize a knowledge base spanning millennia, corporate pop culture prostitutes spew talking points for Big Pharma's mRNA mystery cocktail as the only solution.
[00:01:57.395 --> 00:02:04.361]  And if the solution is less people, which is what the elitists have been saying for decades, then they are succeeding.
[00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:13.669]  Multiple studies conducted in the UK show that after the vaccine was introduced, COVID deaths increased by over a thousand percent.
[00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.354]  And more than half of all COVID deaths and hospitalizations are from the fully vaccinated.
[00:02:21.936 --> 00:02:24.338]  The numbers in New York City are showing the same.
[00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:36.513]  Experts in the field, including the inventor of the mRNA tech being used, have been warning of this since the beginning, but silenced by the corporate media.
[00:02:38.394 --> 00:02:47.817]  Project Veritas has recently exposed how doctors and nurses are well aware of the dangerous mRNA jabs, but care more about their own jobs.
[00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:53.339]  And how even low-level big pharma employees care only about the numbers.
[00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:57.370]  It is an all-out attack against the human race.
[00:02:58.752 --> 00:03:01.576]  We knew this a year ago because we know their white papers.
[00:03:02.477 --> 00:03:04.239]  Which is why we know what comes next.
[00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:17.682]  Brought to you by the same characters behind the mRNA vaccines, what comes next is the end of natural organic humanity, and the beginning of man's own version.
[00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:21.403]  Man, fused with machine in a lab.
[00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:22.744]  The end.
[00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:25.265]  There is no more hiding the endgame.
[00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:30.066]  It's out in the open, where only the unbrainwashed can see it.
[00:03:31.272 --> 00:03:33.313]  Ultimately, it will be up to the people.
[00:03:33.953 --> 00:03:37.635]  The police in Australia are loyally serving their globalist masters.
[00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:40.977]  What makes you think anything will be different in America?
[00:03:41.977 --> 00:03:47.820]  A flight surgeon for the US Army has warned that all vaccinated pilots are unfit to fly.
[00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.856]  The US military is being destroyed from within.
[00:03:52.777 --> 00:03:56.439]  The only way through to freedom is for the people to say no.
[00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.581]  Which is now starting to happen all across the world.
[00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:04.643]  Humanity uniting together as the human race.
[00:04:05.363 --> 00:04:10.786]  Standing up against the most sophisticated tyranny that mankind has ever faced.
[00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:14.828]  All while the pop culture media machine ignores it.
[00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:20.004]  A worldwide peaceful revolution of the people is a numbers game.
[00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:24.728]  So continuing to wake people up is our road to liberation.
[00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:30.312]  Do not remain silent during this dire time at the crossroads of human history.
[00:04:30.973 --> 00:04:33.475]  It is the truth that shall set us free.
[00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:41.816]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Reis.
[00:04:41.816 --> 00:05:03.175]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowars and say, "I don't know what's
[00:05:03.175 --> 00:05:05.616]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?"
[00:05:05.824 --> 00:05:07.826]  You better believe you got one!
[00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:15.631]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:17.912 --> 00:05:21.254]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, October 1st, 2021.
[00:05:23.652 --> 00:05:30.036]  The Battle Info Wars operation goes into overdrive on the other side of this 60 second break.
[00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:33.898]  Escape from the New World Order!
[00:05:35.238 --> 00:05:37.580]  Escape from the Great Reset!
[00:05:38.661 --> 00:05:43.928]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, on this Friday, October 1st, 2021 broadcast.
[00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:51.537]  I got back from Dallas last night doing Steven Crowder's show and a bunch of other great programs up there at the Blaze headquarters and then over at his headquarters.
[00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.882]  So talented, so smart, and so awake.
[00:05:56.527 --> 00:06:02.391]  Then I got home and got to talk to another good person I know, Joe Rogan, who's really hardcore and awake now.
[00:06:03.192 --> 00:06:04.913]  And so it's a good world.
[00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:08.256]  I'm in good company and I'm very, very blessed to be here because I'm in your company.
[00:06:08.896 --> 00:06:12.119]  And I'm just extremely, again, honored to be in this fight at this level.
[00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.181]  And boy, let me tell you, Glenn Beck gave me a painting.
[00:06:15.221 --> 00:06:17.203]  His paintings are very valuable, very well done as well.
[00:06:17.263 --> 00:06:18.564]  And we buried the hatchet.
[00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:28.987]  And a lot of other stuff that I won't get into on air at this point, but people now know that I didn't make any of this stuff up and that I've meant well always and had about a 98% accuracy rate.
[00:06:29.608 --> 00:06:37.574]  And so the fact that InfoWars is being so widely accepted across the board now really shows that we've got a fighting chance because we have been the tip of the spear.
[00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:39.896]  And that's all because of you keeping us on air.
[00:06:40.337 --> 00:06:41.578]  That's all because of your prayers.
[00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:43.159]  It's all because of your financial support.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.540]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.315]   That's why when you call in, say thank you, thank you, thank you, Alex.
[00:06:49.315 --> 00:06:51.474]  Look, I don't mind the thanks, I appreciate it.
[00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:56.175]   But you are the resistance, and I salute you and I thank you.
[00:06:56.175 --> 00:07:00.795]   Now, I've got more energy than I've ever had 'cause the fight's so intense and so serious,
[00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:06.634]   and I've just gotta be careful, like a thousand horsepower NASCAR not to blow my engine,
[00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:12.515]   and all of us have to do that together as well and just let God be our Northern Star, be our guiding light.
[00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:13.911]  What a time to be alive.
[00:07:14.152 --> 00:07:15.372]  Let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:07:16.053 --> 00:07:23.737]  Incredible hearings yesterday on the Supreme Court ruling on abortion and states' rights.
[00:07:24.518 --> 00:07:33.130]   And the most bizarre, horrifying, if it wasn't so sick, it'd be hilarious, Statements about abortion.
[00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:42.212]  Democrat Congress people saying, quote, act of love as they protest abortion law.
[00:07:42.252 --> 00:07:44.993]  They say killing babies in the womb is an act of love.
[00:07:46.214 --> 00:07:49.255]  So we're going to be getting to all of those clips coming up next segment.
[00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:52.556]  We have again every day I come on air.
[00:07:52.796 --> 00:07:57.577]  It's a bigger day than the previous day with the COVID-19 martial law takeover.
[00:07:57.617 --> 00:07:58.458]  We've got all that news.
[00:07:58.998 --> 00:07:59.458]  Congress.
[00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:14.066]  The judicial branch, the White House staff, the CDC, the FDA, the USPS, NIAID, Pfizer, and Moderna are all exempt from forced inoculations, but they want to make you be forced to take it.
[00:08:14.567 --> 00:08:19.389]  Dianne Feinstein introduces bills to require a COVID vaccine in order to fly domestically, but she's exempt.
[00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:20.709]  I mean, you talk about discrimination.
[00:08:21.349 --> 00:08:28.252]  Oh, meanwhile, Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug that's suspiciously similar to ivermectin.
[00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:29.893]  They're just changing the molecule a little.
[00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.834]  Saying, oh, the new pill you'll take daily to stop COVID is Ivermectin.
[00:08:37.555 --> 00:08:37.775]  Yep.
[00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:39.477]  Wow.
[00:08:40.537 --> 00:08:42.138]  Absolutely incredible, isn't it?
[00:08:42.158 --> 00:08:43.279]  We're going to be getting to all of that.
[00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:52.906]  They also just approved, they also just approved another horse medicine steroid for humans for COVID.
[00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:54.527]  Yeah, there's the headline on Drudge.
[00:08:55.327 --> 00:08:58.910]  A drug that can cut your risk of COVID death.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:07.661]  In half, but they've been fighting so hard to keep us from getting the Ivermectin.
[00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:08.681]  It isn't just about money.
[00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:10.562]  They want to be able to kill us.
[00:09:11.482 --> 00:09:13.843]  They've got new viruses that you know Ivermectin won't work on.
[00:09:13.863 --> 00:09:14.643]  They're about to roll out.
[00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:20.904]  I'm gonna lay all that out today because it's the horrible future we face if we don't stand up and say no.
[00:09:20.924 --> 00:09:25.225]  And then we've got more on the Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel.
[00:09:26.414 --> 00:09:34.037]  Highly decorated, held without being charged in a prison, in a brig, in a military stockade, now for six days.
[00:09:35.637 --> 00:09:45.561]  And that ties in with Politico coming out on MSNBC and defending that the FBI basically ran the provocateur operation on January 6th.
[00:09:47.282 --> 00:10:09.175]   And the Green Beret that didn't go in the building, who's been on our show, who recorded the FBI trying to get him to be an informant, He has now been SWAT teamed for a misdemeanor of trespassing on the Capitol grounds, and they SWAT teamed his whole house, searched his house, searched his travel trailer, searched his shed, took a bunch of stuff and threw him in jail for a misdemeanor.
[00:10:09.655 --> 00:10:12.976]  Well, at least they've charged him with something unlike the Green Beret.
[00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:20.415]  You know, of past, I guess, when they're being held in North Vietnamese prison camps.
[00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:25.999]  But that's really what the January 6th people still being held in solitary confinement, many of them, are basically living under.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.366]  To the point of even authoritarians in Belarus can point at America now when we criticize them for authoritarianism and say you're worse than us.
[00:10:34.446 --> 00:10:35.687]  It's just incredible.
[00:10:35.727 --> 00:10:45.042]   And that ties into Something I'm going to cover because it's so interesting, not because I'm in the middle of it, because I've got plenty of news we're in that I'm not going to get to because it's boring.
[00:10:45.783 --> 00:10:47.323]  It's just pure poppycock.
[00:10:48.464 --> 00:10:53.046]  But did you know the Democrats across the country are getting rid of the jury trial?
[00:10:53.826 --> 00:11:05.532]  And that judges are announcing beyond the kangaroo court, as the old Aussie joke was, you're supposed to have a jury trial, but the judge would put, you know, nine or twelve kangaroos in there and then say that they voted against you, that they convicted you.
[00:11:06.893 --> 00:11:16.842]   In Austin, The judge in our Sandy Hook case, the other one retired, we've been on appeal, the anti-slap thing for a couple years, and the COVID shut things down for a year.
[00:11:17.702 --> 00:11:26.426]  At her second hearing with us, defaulted us and said, you are guilty, you owe money to these families for your speech, and you don't get a jury trial, I'm gonna decide the money.
[00:11:27.327 --> 00:11:43.445]   So, and even the Huffington Post said, this is really a theory, no one's ever done it like this, only if somebody is being sued or whatever, And they don't challenge the case or don't go to court or never even show up or leave the country.
[00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:46.008]  Then you can get a default if they can still show evidence.
[00:11:46.729 --> 00:11:47.509]  That's not what this is.
[00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:49.031]  We gave them more info than anybody ever would.
[00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:50.392]  It wasn't about my statements on here.
[00:11:50.412 --> 00:11:56.298]  It was all your bank accounts and all your emails and just literally hundreds of thousands of pieces of material.
[00:11:56.659 --> 00:11:58.440]  And they would always say, you've given us nothing!
[00:11:59.491 --> 00:12:09.438]  The media would say that, and that's why I said a month ago, I said they just want to default in both Connecticut and Texas, in my view, because they don't want me to actually put people on the stand who I've never said their names.
[00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:12.540]  You know, under Texas law, you can't sue somebody for defamation if you haven't said their name.
[00:12:13.761 --> 00:12:15.022]  That's in the Texas law.
[00:12:15.042 --> 00:12:15.722]  It's in the law.
[00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:18.204]  But Democrats don't care.
[00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.045]  They go ahead with this.
[00:12:20.065 --> 00:12:22.667]  This is the same Democrats that indicted Governor Rick Perry.
[00:12:24.454 --> 00:12:38.362]  When the county attorney was drunk, spitting on police, attacking them, and then she ran the state ethics board, a $25 million-a-year deal from the state legislature to fund an anti-corruption board, and Perry just said, fire her off that as the head of it, or I'll veto your money.
[00:12:38.622 --> 00:12:39.803]  He vetoed it, and they indicted him.
[00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.196]  Yeah, there's CNN.
[00:12:43.216 --> 00:12:45.778]  By the way, that's something I'm proud of, man.
[00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:49.781]  Last night, after this came out, I went to the CNN website, and there I was right at the top.
[00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:53.805]  I mean, that's like John Hancock signing his signature big on the Declaration of Independence.
[00:12:54.165 --> 00:13:01.352]  I mean, those enemies of America, the globalists, are just up there saying he's guilty, the judge says, because he never gave them any info.
[00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:09.858]  And these judges would order me, they'd say, give us your secret marketing on Sandy Hook.
[00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:14.284]  They'd say, we didn't market Sandy, we barely talked about it, but our news isn't marketing.
[00:13:14.665 --> 00:13:16.808]  Products we sell, we tell you about them, that's the marketing.
[00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:23.224]  And in Connecticut, when we turned over, we said, well, here's our marketing for sheets for ad reads.
[00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:24.665]  They said, that's not that.
[00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:27.786]  You tried to give us your Sandy Hook marketing as another marketing.
[00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:29.026]  You're hiding it.
[00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:40.350]  So it's very Kafka-esque where you're supposed to produce something that doesn't exist because all these judges, in my view, want is brownie points for the media, which is a dead, dying dinosaur system.
[00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:46.092]  So go ahead and cling to that like an insect in fall as the winter comes or the leaves trying to cling.
[00:13:47.132 --> 00:13:49.894]  You know, to their branches when the winter comes.
[00:13:50.655 --> 00:13:52.096]  Those political systems are going down.
[00:13:52.116 --> 00:13:52.797]  They're going away.
[00:13:52.837 --> 00:13:53.697]  They're going to the ground.
[00:13:54.158 --> 00:13:55.659]  They're politically dying.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.624]  And we're seeing the last gasp of this whole globalist system with the COVID lockdowns and the medical martial law and the rest of it.
[00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:05.666]  And it's just all par for the course of where we are.
[00:14:05.706 --> 00:14:07.007]  So I grieve for the nation.
[00:14:08.028 --> 00:14:09.589]  But this is what I expected to happen.
[00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:13.072]  Hell, Owen's been charged with attacking the Capitol.
[00:14:13.092 --> 00:14:13.993]  Didn't even go in the Capitol.
[00:14:14.013 --> 00:14:15.054]  Trying to put him in jail for years.
[00:14:16.194 --> 00:14:21.417]  People that were just at the Capitol peacefully there protesting outside the Capitol are being swatting by the FBI.
[00:14:21.817 --> 00:14:26.179]  Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonels that say, you know, this is designed to collapse Afghanistan.
[00:14:26.439 --> 00:14:27.159]  This is wrong.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.241]  His problem was he wasn't painting swastikas on the walls and blaming somebody for it.
[00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:32.642]  It wasn't false flagging.
[00:14:32.702 --> 00:14:36.524]  So we're in good company here to be persecuted by these people.
[00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:38.805]  And again, this is beyond kangaroo court.
[00:14:38.825 --> 00:14:41.226]  I mean, there's not even kangaroos on the jury.
[00:14:41.246 --> 00:14:42.086]  There's just no jury.
[00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:45.863]  Alex Jones today, you tomorrow.
[00:14:45.903 --> 00:14:47.885]  And this is what's happening all over the country.
[00:14:48.225 --> 00:14:50.006]  They've weaponized the judiciary.
[00:14:50.386 --> 00:14:51.367]  The Democratic Party has.
[00:14:51.787 --> 00:14:54.049]  And Republicans sit there and just suck their thumbs and do nothing.
[00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:55.189]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:55.249 --> 00:14:55.930]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.954]  So, by increment, not just the United States, but the whole world has gone under corporate global governance.
[00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:11.214]  And global governance has traditionally been opposed by liberals, people who believe in low taxes, the right to defend themselves, family rights, less government.
[00:15:11.314 --> 00:15:14.476]  Liberal means more freedom in the classical 1776 sense.
[00:15:14.536 --> 00:15:21.020]  So they became the liberals with their leftist ideology that has nothing to do with the liberal ideology.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.583]  And they now control language to a great extent.
[00:15:25.603 --> 00:15:29.145]  They've dumbed the public down to a massive extent.
[00:15:30.065 --> 00:15:40.278]   In fact, I even have Biden's education secretary Cardona saying, quote, parents should not be the primary stakeholders in their children's education.
[00:15:42.521 --> 00:15:44.242]  These are real quotes.
[00:15:44.262 --> 00:15:44.963]  I have the video.
[00:15:44.983 --> 00:15:48.006]  In fact, I'm going to play it in a moment.
[00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:50.629]  We're going to play Biden's education secretary first.
[00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:53.752]  And then that ties into just countless other clips.
[00:15:56.479 --> 00:16:07.327]  Biden's nominee for top bank regulator earned Lennon Award, praise USSR's equality, and wants to end banking as we know it.
[00:16:07.487 --> 00:16:12.711]  And that's what the big mega banks want, where we live under communism, they live offshore, exempt from it.
[00:16:14.893 --> 00:16:17.094]  Meanwhile, AOC suggests she was raped.
[00:16:17.214 --> 00:16:19.156]  She says, I speak about this as a survivor.
[00:16:19.716 --> 00:16:25.821]  She also cried when Israel got funding for an iron dome that shoots down offensive missiles.
[00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:35.246]  I mean, she also cried in an empty field with a fence up around it saying there were children drinking out of toilets on the other side.
[00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:38.367]  I mean, it's just one lie after another.
[00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:49.934]  But next segment, I'm going to get to all of these articles and these video clips I've got that are just next level.
[00:16:49.994 --> 00:16:52.275]  I mean, I don't even hate Democrats and Liberals anymore.
[00:16:52.315 --> 00:16:54.417]  They're like spoiled, rotten three-year-olds.
[00:16:55.526 --> 00:17:03.871]  With power that just lie incessantly and are gaslighting us saying the most ridiculous things you can imagine.
[00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:18.360]  Remember during the Democrat debates, what a clown show it was, where they were all debating about, you know, who could say the most ridiculous thing, like, I think it's very important to get transgender women abortions.
[00:17:20.002 --> 00:17:23.898]   He said men who become Women.
[00:17:24.539 --> 00:17:25.039]  Abortions.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:38.988]  And they're straight-faced saying, we give condoms to the women in the California Correctional Facility so they can have sex with other women so they can become pregnant.
[00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:46.273]  And they just sit here and gaslight us, and they pass the law that if they want to, they can put you in jail for disagreeing with that.
[00:17:46.794 --> 00:17:49.155]  I mean, this is a cult of freaks.
[00:17:50.516 --> 00:17:52.758]  Because if they can get you to accept that, you'll accept anything.
[00:17:54.844 --> 00:17:55.805]  That's all coming up next segment.
[00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:56.746]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:17:57.126 --> 00:17:58.728]  Here's Biden's education secretary.
[00:17:59.168 --> 00:18:02.772]  And of course, you see this in headlines and mainstream news, like parents are a problem.
[00:18:03.112 --> 00:18:05.295]  It's time to rethink parents being in charge of the children.
[00:18:05.535 --> 00:18:06.896]  It's time for the state to be in charge.
[00:18:06.936 --> 00:18:09.799]  I mean, these are classic bonafide.
[00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:13.672]  100% tyrannical platforms in history.
[00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:14.652]  I mean, we know they're bad.
[00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:15.952]  We know they're horrible.
[00:18:16.312 --> 00:18:17.892]  We know they destroy productivity and freedom.
[00:18:17.932 --> 00:18:20.173]  I mean, it's like, hey, is brain cancer good?
[00:18:20.553 --> 00:18:21.153]  Probably not.
[00:18:21.173 --> 00:18:24.074]  Hey, is shooting yourself in the head with a shotgun fun?
[00:18:24.214 --> 00:18:25.134]  Probably not good.
[00:18:26.474 --> 00:18:31.895]  Is having the state-run children take over full society and force injections on us, but they're exempt?
[00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:32.475]  Is that a good idea?
[00:18:32.775 --> 00:18:34.396]  No, that's animal farm for real.
[00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:40.226]  The average leftist is so uneducated and dumbed down, they're like, what's an animal farm?
[00:18:40.386 --> 00:18:41.507]  You're saying I'm on a farm?
[00:18:42.848 --> 00:18:46.210]  No, it's the story of Animal Farm, George Orwell, another one of his masterpieces.
[00:18:47.872 --> 00:18:48.892]  So here's just one of the clips.
[00:18:48.912 --> 00:18:49.213]  Here it is.
[00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:53.179]  Fairly quick answers here, because I want to get to Secretary Becerra.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:19:00.327]  Do you think parents should be in charge of their child's education as the primary stakeholder?
[00:19:01.248 --> 00:19:09.337]  I believe parents are important stakeholders, but I also believe educators have a role in determining educational programming.
[00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:11.098]  I think that's going to be a little out of focus.
[00:19:11.138 --> 00:19:23.747]  What I think you're going to find across all elements of education, since they pay the bills, they raise the kids, they probably need to be the primary spokespeople for their own kids' good education.
[00:19:24.708 --> 00:19:25.649]  Probably need.
[00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:28.391]  He needs to be fired.
[00:19:30.632 --> 00:19:31.393]  Here's the quotes.
[00:19:31.473 --> 00:19:36.397]  Biden's nominee for top bank regulator earned Lennon Award, praise USSR's equality.
[00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:42.903]  And wants to end banking as we know it, which is exactly what the IMF and World Bank and Klaus Schwab want.
[00:19:42.963 --> 00:19:51.269]  Bankrupt everything, give you enough money to barely live, but you have to live in these new corporate dormitories that totally control every fashion of your life.
[00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:57.734]  And she talks about, you know, when she immigrated here from a communist country, that she doesn't like America and wants to make it communist.
[00:19:57.774 --> 00:19:59.976]  You need to go read the quotes here.
[00:19:59.996 --> 00:20:01.477]  Well, why the hell did you come here then?
[00:20:02.338 --> 00:20:04.800]  Oh, because you want to be a manager in the communist takeover.
[00:20:05.998 --> 00:20:13.042]  You're not going to be in the gulag, like all the rest of us, once they collapse the society and the economy, where they're going to shield us in place.
[00:20:13.282 --> 00:20:14.363]  Why are we all going to a camp?
[00:20:14.543 --> 00:20:16.724]  Oh, so you'll be safe from the unvaccinated.
[00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:19.286]  Oh, they're the ones I've got to go to a camp.
[00:20:19.446 --> 00:20:21.507]  Oh, who are the unvaccinated?
[00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:23.288]  This is a popular sign.
[00:20:23.368 --> 00:20:26.150]  It's totally true that a lot of people are taking out the demonstrations.
[00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:35.035]  I think I'm gonna make a t-shirt called the hypocrisy tour 2021 at the top and then say exempt from Biden's vaccine mandates.
[00:20:36.465 --> 00:20:58.205]  Congress, legislative branch, their staff, all of them, judicial branch, the judges, White House staff, CDC employees, FDA employees, USPS employees, NIAID employees, Pfizer employees, Moderna employees, because they need to be a working unit while the rest of us are poisoned and died, then they'll extract the money out of us.
[00:20:58.225 --> 00:21:06.701]   I mean, imagine a world like that, but see, oh, we're all being lectured about how Apple gave $100 million to Black Lives Matter, so they're allowed to run Chinese slave camps.
[00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:09.763]  They're allowed to spy on you and track what you do.
[00:21:09.963 --> 00:21:11.224]  Because they're the good liberals.
[00:21:11.264 --> 00:21:14.346]  I mean, Tim Cook wears turtlenecks and he's gay.
[00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:19.750]  So because he gets in a bed with men, he's allowed to have suicide nets around his factories.
[00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.533]  Because again, he's curating Alex Jones off the internet, but he gets to be there.
[00:21:24.593 --> 00:21:26.055]  He's the good man.
[00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:30.800]  It's like the New York Times lying about WMDs on purpose, and all of the evil things.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:38.142]  Oh, but I questioned one of the big events they hyped up because of a lot of the anomalies, and I have a right to question that.
[00:21:39.062 --> 00:21:49.685]  In fact, I for a while thought it didn't happen, then I thought it probably did, and now seeing how synthetic everything is, maybe my original instinct, maybe Alex Jones is always right.
[00:21:49.705 --> 00:21:52.745]  I'm pretty much right 99% of the time, folks, and so are you.
[00:21:52.765 --> 00:21:55.306]  I mean, we all know this is easy to look at and see what's happening.
[00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:58.544]  And what did I say six months ago?
[00:21:58.564 --> 00:22:03.311]  I said they're going to come out with another version of hydroxychloroquine.
[00:22:03.471 --> 00:22:04.032]  Now they have.
[00:22:04.613 --> 00:22:08.098]  And they're coming out with a new version of basically the same molecule of ivermectin.
[00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:12.344]  Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug that's suspiciously similar.
[00:22:13.703 --> 00:22:14.984]  To horse paste.
[00:22:15.945 --> 00:22:18.748]  Big article on InfoWars.com from ZeroEdge.com.
[00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:21.471]  Be sure and check that out for yourself.
[00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:25.474]  Also, Globalist Big Tech continues its assault on truth and people's livelihoods.
[00:22:26.015 --> 00:22:26.816]  That's yesterday.
[00:22:26.876 --> 00:22:27.917]  The War Room made a great point.
[00:22:27.957 --> 00:22:29.498]  That was a great broadcast.
[00:22:29.518 --> 00:22:30.359]  That's all coming up.
[00:22:30.399 --> 00:22:38.631]   But first, Howard Stern's following talking points, and I understand that, because I hear the same talking points on every channel.
[00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:50.754]  They admittedly are paying these networks, in his case, millions of dollars, to put out government PR disguised as comedy, because they know you don't listen to the news anymore, so they hit the comedy shows, the syndicated shows, the late night shows.
[00:22:50.774 --> 00:23:01.636]  But he came out and attacked Dr. Richard Bartlett, who's been using Modecidine for a year and a half to save people, and now they even have an Oxford study saying he's right.
[00:23:03.051 --> 00:23:04.792]  And really attacking him viciously.
[00:23:04.812 --> 00:23:13.396]  So I thought we'd get him on just to talk about why they're so scared of this, and how much money would you have to take to be part of killing him like Howard Stern does?
[00:23:13.996 --> 00:23:23.180]  I mean, Howard Stern taking that money becomes a person aiding and abetting, in my view, the murder of people by keeping life-saving drugs away from them.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:23.640]  Stay with us.
[00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:51.917]   We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide, and there is a real attempt By Big Pharma and the UN and big corporations through government to suppress Senator Rand Paul, who's a medical doctor reading an Israeli study with natural immunity being 27 times better than the so-called vaccine immunity, which they now admit basically disappears in most cases in just a few months.
[00:23:52.912 --> 00:23:59.858]  Well, there's a big article in Newsmax, Rand Paul and Dr. Richard Bartlett, government needs to get out of the way of COVID treatments.
[00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:04.082]  And Dr. Bartlett has done hundreds and hundreds of interviews.
[00:24:04.122 --> 00:24:06.684]  He's talked to hundreds of millions of people, not just here, but around the world.
[00:24:07.084 --> 00:24:15.272]  And he's one of the top doctors that has selflessly for free, steered people to online pharmacies to get known drugs that help people.
[00:24:16.233 --> 00:24:19.856]  And in his case for free, he's making no money doing that and working 20 hours a day.
[00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:23.232]  And so imagine being Howard Stern.
[00:24:23.272 --> 00:24:31.234]  They admit that basketball players have been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, some TV shows millions of dollars, to put out these talking points.
[00:24:31.294 --> 00:24:34.535]  The talking points we hear from Howard Stern are those talking points.
[00:24:34.555 --> 00:24:42.418]  The one they've been beating is a host out of Tennessee who died of COVID.
[00:24:43.387 --> 00:24:45.628]  Well, we've never said people aren't dying of COVID.
[00:24:46.209 --> 00:24:47.390]  We've said they're blocking the treatments.
[00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:54.654]  And so they were attacking Bartlett because, as best I could tell, he'd been on that show.
[00:24:55.174 --> 00:24:57.796]  And, oh, look, I wonder what Bart will do now that this guy's died.
[00:24:57.816 --> 00:24:59.037]  He'll find somebody else.
[00:24:59.517 --> 00:25:00.778]  They're making a big joke about it.
[00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:10.104]  Meanwhile, Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug that's suspiciously similar to ivermectin horse paste.
[00:25:12.168 --> 00:25:16.211]  And Congress has exempted itself from these very same injections.
[00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:26.017]  So I thought we'd get the doc on this segment next to respond to this because they weren't attacking him for ivermectin, they were attacking him for the inhalable steroid.
[00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:32.706]  That I witnessed my dad go from almost dead to 90% better the next day.
[00:25:33.326 --> 00:25:37.770]  But here's Howard Stern really, you know, celebrating people's deaths.
[00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:43.935]  I saw when Laura Loomer got COVID that they have a website celebrating conservatives that get it and saying, will she be dead?
[00:25:44.315 --> 00:25:45.596]  Is the graveyard looming?
[00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:47.458]  This is really sick.
[00:25:47.938 --> 00:25:48.319]  Here it is.
[00:25:49.139 --> 00:25:49.320]  Okay.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.362]  Maybe you should have done that on the radio.
[00:25:54.004 --> 00:25:54.584]  Exactly.
[00:25:55.145 --> 00:25:55.405]  Yeah.
[00:25:56.807 --> 00:26:04.671]  The other thing he would do is he'd bring in like guests to pitch what they call like miracle cures for the virus.
[00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:06.292]  It's harmless, so why do you need a cure?
[00:26:06.372 --> 00:26:07.592]  Yeah, why do you need it?
[00:26:08.393 --> 00:26:18.598]  But this guy came on, Dr. Richard Bartlett, and he said in his practice there was a hundred percent COVID survival rate if you inhaled this steroid called budesonide.
[00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:21.130]  That's like cyanide.
[00:26:22.031 --> 00:26:26.034]  Right, but I guess Phil never inhaled it because he died.
[00:26:28.456 --> 00:26:29.297]  You got tape of that?
[00:26:30.157 --> 00:26:31.338]  Yeah, clip two.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.720]  I want to hear that.
[00:26:35.602 --> 00:26:37.604]  You'll hear Phil's voice too.
[00:26:37.644 --> 00:26:44.149]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have a guest today who has a cure for your COVID, even though there is no such a thing.
[00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:46.431]  But if you do get it, Dovesonide will save you.
[00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:57.836]  And it turns out what they had given me as a generic at the drugstore was essentially what you were prescribing for folks with coronavirus.
[00:26:58.536 --> 00:26:59.897]  Uh, how do you pronounce this again?
[00:26:59.917 --> 00:27:01.678]  Budesonide.
[00:27:01.698 --> 00:27:04.820]  If you use the breathing treatment, it's targeted medicine.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.623]  It's like turning the faucet off for the poisons to be delivered into the bloodstream.
[00:27:10.283 --> 00:27:12.586]  And so it's a game-changer.
[00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:14.447]  We've been using this since March.
[00:27:15.288 --> 00:27:17.190]  Zero of my patients have died.
[00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.671]  Zero percent of my patients.
[00:27:18.791 --> 00:27:21.334]  And I know thousands have been treated with this.
[00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:24.477]  eudefinideworks.com is the website.
[00:27:24.597 --> 00:27:26.318]  It's $3 a treatment.
[00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:27.860]  It's pre-mixed, pre-measured.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.722]  This is a winning strategy.
[00:27:31.103 --> 00:27:31.984]  Gee, it's amazing.
[00:27:32.024 --> 00:27:33.585]  None of us have heard of that.
[00:27:34.745 --> 00:27:39.728]  And none of us know whether the people he gave this to had COVID.
[00:27:40.609 --> 00:27:43.410]  I just wonder if Phil took a little divesonide before he went.
[00:27:44.211 --> 00:27:46.772]  I guess not if it's 100% survival rate.
[00:27:47.093 --> 00:27:51.936]  Well, it's pretty good odds even still if you had like all your patients lived except for Phil.
[00:27:52.636 --> 00:27:55.278]  Okay, so let's stop right there.
[00:27:55.718 --> 00:27:57.199]  Let me tell you something, Howard Stern.
[00:27:58.059 --> 00:27:59.600]  My dad lives here in town, 71 years old.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.361]  And you know, he's in decent shape, but I've known him my whole life.
[00:28:04.421 --> 00:28:07.023]  My dad, David Jones, David Ross Jones.
[00:28:08.203 --> 00:28:11.065]  And he didn't tell me he was sick, and I went over to his house.
[00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:13.086]  He had like 82 oxygen when I tested him.
[00:28:13.386 --> 00:28:15.867]  He was blue, naked in the bed, didn't know he was, couldn't get up.
[00:28:16.947 --> 00:28:21.269]  And I called Dr. Bartlett, and he called in a prescription, had to find a pharmacy that would give it to us.
[00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:26.112]  And my dad was 50% better within about five hours.
[00:28:27.276 --> 00:28:28.636]  And I stayed there that night.
[00:28:28.676 --> 00:28:30.997]  By about 3 in the morning, he was about 60-70% better.
[00:28:31.017 --> 00:28:38.799]  And the next day, I've told this story many times, they've been sitting out there for a week when I got there a bunch of packages and four or five boxes of pool chairs.
[00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:40.379]  His old pool chairs got old and fell apart.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.260]  Finally got some new pool chairs.
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.021]  And he was there putting them together in the morning.
[00:28:45.701 --> 00:28:48.781]  Now, he still had brain fog and stuff, but he was, his oxygen was like 96.
[00:28:49.702 --> 00:28:50.222]  He was back.
[00:28:51.087 --> 00:28:53.768]  And that was all with what Dr. Bartlett prescribed.
[00:28:54.308 --> 00:29:11.075]  And so you talk about the evil making jokes about this when Dr. Bartlett was the board head for Governor Rick Perry on the state's medical board and runs a hospital emergency room and is very respected and tirelessly helps people.
[00:29:11.115 --> 00:29:12.256]  I know he helped more than 100 people.
[00:29:13.868 --> 00:29:18.252]  That I gave his number to, and then they gave the number until he was helping thousands of people, I would imagine.
[00:29:18.272 --> 00:29:21.535]  I mean, it's insane to compare this guy to Stern.
[00:29:21.555 --> 00:29:24.718]  But it's very sad that Stern would sell his soul like this.
[00:29:24.778 --> 00:29:26.940]  I guess he's always been this bad, maybe.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.161]  To do this was very sad.
[00:29:28.181 --> 00:29:29.262]  So I'm going to just bring the doc in.
[00:29:29.302 --> 00:29:29.862]  He's very busy.
[00:29:29.882 --> 00:29:30.683]  Can only do it over the phone.
[00:29:31.023 --> 00:29:32.024]  He'll be with us next segment, too.
[00:29:33.291 --> 00:29:36.193]  Dr. Bartlett, I mean, you have the studies now since you first started doing this.
[00:29:36.213 --> 00:29:36.753]  They've admitted it.
[00:29:37.013 --> 00:29:37.814]  What, in Oxford?
[00:29:37.834 --> 00:29:39.955]  Many other places that Budesodine is really good.
[00:29:39.975 --> 00:29:44.858]  It's even on the news that inhalable steroids that you pioneered are having a great effect.
[00:29:44.878 --> 00:29:48.040]  Because we know a lot of viruses kill people with the autoimmune response, right?
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.061]  Or the inflammation.
[00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:56.265]  Explain this and what it's like to... Stern goes on to imply you're making money off this and that you're killing people.
[00:29:56.285 --> 00:29:58.067]  What do you want to say to Howard Stern, doctor?
[00:29:58.087 --> 00:30:05.873]   Are you talking about that clown that hides behind a A wig and glasses that's just a talking head.
[00:30:05.893 --> 00:30:07.714]  Are you talking about that guy?
[00:30:07.734 --> 00:30:09.455]  Yes, sir!
[00:30:10.055 --> 00:30:16.397]  Well, for he and his minions to say they've never heard of Budesonide shows that obviously they haven't gone to medical school.
[00:30:17.117 --> 00:30:22.999]  And so, Budesonide is an inhaled steroid that's been around for over two decades.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:30.042]  There's a ton of information out there on it, many studies.
[00:30:31.109 --> 00:30:38.851]  This is the medicine that I was talking about using against COVID early because it's an inhaled steroid.
[00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:44.892]  It's a targeted approach of using an inhaled steroid instead of using IV steroids.
[00:30:45.412 --> 00:30:48.793]  Oxford University is the oldest university in the English-speaking world.
[00:30:49.273 --> 00:31:02.152]   They did the STOIC trial, a randomized controlled trial, and they concluded that 90% of COVID hospitalizations ER visits and urgent care visits would be prevented with just that one medicine, inhaled Budesonide against COVID.
[00:31:02.592 --> 00:31:05.434]  I'm not surprised that Howard Stern hasn't done his homework.
[00:31:05.955 --> 00:31:07.676]  He's just reading what they tell him to read.
[00:31:08.377 --> 00:31:15.863]  And he's not a doctor, and obviously he hasn't asked anybody that was intelligent to do research before they did the show.
[00:31:16.283 --> 00:31:17.304]  But he did us a favor.
[00:31:17.824 --> 00:31:19.566]  He let the cat out of the bag.
[00:31:19.966 --> 00:31:22.068]  There is effective early outpatient treatment.
[00:31:22.528 --> 00:31:39.203]   Inhaled Budesonide, monoclonal antibodies, I'm actually, you're right, I was a top advisor for Governor Rick Perry for seven years, and I received the Meritorious Service Award from the Commissioner of Health and Human Services.
[00:31:39.263 --> 00:31:42.525]  It was a surprise at the end of the seven years, they were grateful for my efforts.
[00:31:43.636 --> 00:31:54.368]  Uh, but now I'm helping with a new project with the new governor, Governor Abbott, and this is with the Texas Division of Emergency Management, where we're doing monoclonal antibody infusion.
[00:31:54.849 --> 00:32:03.639]  And I'm sure Howard Stern hasn't heard of that, even though... Well, that's right, you're not tooting your horn, but you helped get the governor to do this, and then with taxpayer money, provide it to the public, because you're such a kook.
[00:32:04.755 --> 00:32:23.582]  Yeah, I'm such a kook that I am, uh, when I get a call on Friday saying, would you please help with this, uh, emergency, Texas emergency management project for West Texas, where you live for your people, that I am so crazy that I get that text on Friday and on Monday, I'm dressed like a walking marshmallow in universal precaution.
[00:32:24.082 --> 00:32:29.724]  And for 11 hour days, six days a week, I'm only around infectious COVID patients.
[00:32:29.744 --> 00:32:30.625]  Doctor, stay right there.
[00:32:30.645 --> 00:32:31.265]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:32.685 --> 00:32:34.066]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:37.145 --> 00:32:44.049]  All right, Dr. Richard Bartlett, who helped popularize Budesonide as a way to counter this inflammation.
[00:32:44.769 --> 00:32:45.830]  I'm no doctor like he is.
[00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.112]  I remember reading about the Spanish flu killing 20, 30, 40 million.
[00:32:49.132 --> 00:32:56.896]  They debate the numbers saying it wasn't the virus necessarily that killed you, it was your body's autoimmune response filling up with fluid.
[00:32:57.376 --> 00:32:58.397]  But I'm a layperson.
[00:32:58.417 --> 00:33:19.409]   Doc, can you explain to Howard Stern and other people Why sure you you tried it on your your patients and it worked but but but why you were already thinking about that because am I not wrong in saying it's well known that for a lot of you know type of viral issues sometimes that they try to try out steroids and see if that works and can you
[00:33:20.229 --> 00:33:24.893]  Explain to Howard Stern, who we'll put on screen and others, because he can save a lot of lives telling people about this.
[00:33:24.913 --> 00:33:26.494]  I mean, maybe he's just ignorant.
[00:33:27.195 --> 00:33:31.498]  Hopefully he can turn back from this and not aid in a bed, you know, keeping medical treatment from people.
[00:33:31.818 --> 00:33:34.200]  I mean, hopefully he's not a eugenicist and a depopulationist.
[00:33:34.501 --> 00:33:35.922]  I don't think he's a Nazi, hopefully.
[00:33:36.462 --> 00:33:38.804]  But can you speak to what the Oxford study says for Howard?
[00:33:40.005 --> 00:33:41.006]  Yeah, okay.
[00:33:41.026 --> 00:33:42.027]  Listen carefully, Howard.
[00:33:42.067 --> 00:33:44.749]  You might get your crayons out and write some things down.
[00:33:45.413 --> 00:33:49.196]  Number one, what happens with COVID is you have a respiratory viral illness.
[00:33:49.356 --> 00:34:04.328]  This virus enters the body through the nose, the throat, the eyes, and multiplies for three to five days, goes into the lungs, and triggers, it goes, the doorway into the body is the ACE receptors.
[00:34:04.588 --> 00:34:11.854]  This virus goes through ACE receptors into cells and starts to multiply and trigger the release of cytokine.
[00:34:12.354 --> 00:34:31.394]   That's a fancy word for Inflammatory chemicals that are released, interleukin 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 15, tumor necrosis factor, thromboxane, which increases the chance of clotting, which would be a heart attack, stroke, or pulmonary embolus, leukotriene, and other dangerous chemicals.
[00:34:31.854 --> 00:34:40.096]  Those all cause an inflammatory response, which then will lead to multi-organ failure if it goes unchecked.
[00:34:40.726 --> 00:34:43.368]  And those chemicals go through the bloodstream total body.
[00:34:43.568 --> 00:34:46.310]  The first place that's hit, obviously, is the lungs, usually.
[00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:56.878]  But it caught all of the symptoms, whether it's a headache, or fever, body ache, diarrhea, those all are the result of cytokines released from the lining in the lung tissue.
[00:34:57.578 --> 00:35:14.596]   And so, inhaled steroid budesonide, in particular, was studied by the country of Spain, France, UK, Oxford University, Australia, NIH, For a reason, they all landed on the same medicine after I announced it.
[00:35:15.377 --> 00:35:19.801]  And that medicine is Budesonide, an inhaled steroid that costs $3 a treatment.
[00:35:20.262 --> 00:35:21.683]  Nobody's going to get rich off of it.
[00:35:22.064 --> 00:35:29.211]  It's so safe it's been used on 2-pound premature babies in the NICU for decades, and doctors never bat an eye using it.
[00:35:29.971 --> 00:35:32.414]  That's about as delicate a human on the planet as there is.
[00:35:33.249 --> 00:35:46.855]  And yet it's inexpensive, it's readily available, it's a medicine at every pharmacy on every corner in the United States, it's in every hospital pharmacy, it's being used around the world now that we've talked about it and it's blown up around the world.
[00:35:47.095 --> 00:35:58.462]   And so there are doctors around the world treating their patients in India, Australia, around the world, with inhaled Budesonide because it's very targeted, very specific.
[00:35:58.762 --> 00:36:02.965]  France even studied Budesonide eye drops against COVID and showed that it was effective.
[00:36:03.345 --> 00:36:05.147]  Why are they landing on that one medicine?
[00:36:05.627 --> 00:36:06.608]  This is why, Howard.
[00:36:07.048 --> 00:36:08.009]  It does two things.
[00:36:08.489 --> 00:36:12.392]  Number one, it stops the release of cytokines right at the source.
[00:36:13.472 --> 00:36:15.634]  Secondly, it down-regulates base receptors.
[00:36:16.032 --> 00:36:19.751]   Children have less ACE receptors and every year they have more and more ACE receptors
[00:36:19.751 --> 00:36:24.612]   So they're 23 to 24 years old and then they have a maximum level of ACE receptors
[00:36:24.612 --> 00:36:28.312]   Remember that ACE receptors are the doorway for the virus to get into the body
[00:36:28.312 --> 00:36:34.152]   That's the reason that's the secret why children have less trouble with COVID than adults because they have less ACE
[00:36:34.152 --> 00:36:37.571]   receptors So if you down regulate the ACE receptors with the inhaled
[00:36:37.571 --> 00:36:42.492]   budesonide, that's a good thing Well, all I know is I got COVID from my parents after I
[00:36:42.492 --> 00:36:45.672]   took care of them and it felt like a gorilla sitting on my chest
[00:36:45.672 --> 00:36:50.971]  and so we're not denying this stuff goes on.
[00:36:49.613 --> 00:36:51.034]  We know Fauci cooked it up in that lab.
[00:36:51.074 --> 00:36:51.634]  It's all come out.
[00:36:51.674 --> 00:36:52.514]  It's a bioweapon.
[00:36:53.175 --> 00:36:54.675]  And then they basically have to admit that now.
[00:36:54.735 --> 00:36:55.675]  The documents have come out.
[00:36:56.116 --> 00:37:11.184]   Shifting gears into that, what do you make of the actual documents that have now come out in the last month, uh, where They state that they combined four viruses together to be able to infect humans and added the HIV delivery system as well.
[00:37:11.284 --> 00:37:12.966]  And it describes COVID perfectly.
[00:37:13.366 --> 00:37:23.914]  And then Fauci orders Peter Daszak to approach the Pentagon and DARPA for $14 million to aerosolize it in micro glass pellets to go through the skin of bats.
[00:37:23.954 --> 00:37:25.975]  And the Pentagon said, no, that'll infect humans.
[00:37:26.256 --> 00:37:27.797]  I mean, that's not just creating gain of function.
[00:37:27.997 --> 00:37:30.359]  That's making the COVID-19 style coronavirus.
[00:37:30.939 --> 00:37:37.324]  And then saying that they wanted to, I know we're shifting gears here, deploy it into the open air, Doctor?
[00:37:37.344 --> 00:37:39.145]  That's insane.
[00:37:39.626 --> 00:37:41.407]  But there are people that are insane.
[00:37:41.888 --> 00:37:44.089]  And so, that are evil.
[00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.091]  Evil really does exist.
[00:37:46.671 --> 00:37:49.894]  And so, the bottom line, these are bioweapons.
[00:37:50.634 --> 00:37:55.258]  What they chose was a highly contagious virus that is normally very benign.
[00:37:55.598 --> 00:37:57.680]  Coronavirus normally causes the common cold.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.041]  And they weaponized it.
[00:37:59.545 --> 00:38:02.167]  And that made it a weapon of mass destruction.
[00:38:02.187 --> 00:38:03.267]  The evidence is here now.
[00:38:04.468 --> 00:38:07.590]  This is a disease that you have to take seriously.
[00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:13.573]  Unfortunately, many people thought it would be just like the flu or something else that we've seen before.
[00:38:13.613 --> 00:38:15.895]  This is a disease that we've never had before.
[00:38:16.395 --> 00:38:17.155]  It's man-made.
[00:38:17.896 --> 00:38:19.697]  I want to say congratulations.
[00:38:20.057 --> 00:38:23.219]  I applaud Senator Rand Paul for his courage.
[00:38:23.689 --> 00:38:30.111]  To out Fauci, to wave the documents showing evidence under Fauci's nose, putting him on his heels.
[00:38:30.551 --> 00:38:41.435]  Fauci was on his heels, red-faced, caught red-handed, and stuttering, stammering because he had been caught in front of the whole world on the Senate floor.
[00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:43.876]  Congratulations, Rand Paul, for your courage.
[00:38:44.576 --> 00:38:49.058]  You know, Senator Tom Cotton has been talking about this looking like a bioweapon for a year.
[00:38:50.419 --> 00:38:58.861]  You know, Alex, you and I are not in those meetings with the CIA and with the heads of national security giving us briefings like the senators get.
[00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:03.442]  They've been telling the world what's been going on for a long time to their credit.
[00:39:03.942 --> 00:39:12.684]  And I'll tell you, Senator Ron Johnson has also made the point that there's early effective outpatient treatment, but Governor DeSantis has blown it out of the water.
[00:39:13.244 --> 00:39:19.826]  He has proven that early effective outpatient treatment is a winning strategy, whether you've been vaccinated or not.
[00:39:20.518 --> 00:39:22.359]  The monoclonal antibodies work.
[00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:23.180]  Absolutely.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:32.005]  You know, I think Howard Stern is taking money, like so many other influencers, I don't know that, I'd like people to ask him that, to read these statements.
[00:39:32.165 --> 00:39:34.927]  And I think he really should think about what he's done.
[00:39:34.987 --> 00:39:36.648]  I know, Doc, you want to focus on solutions.
[00:39:36.668 --> 00:39:37.389]  Let's talk about that.
[00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:45.174]  You've been promoting Regeneron for a long time, and now you helped bring it to Texas, and now you're working with the governor on that.
[00:39:45.774 --> 00:39:49.096]  And when I asked you a month ago about it, you said, well, I don't want to get into it.
[00:39:50.457 --> 00:39:57.261]  When I asked you if Biden was trying to suppress that, well, then it was confirmed two weeks ago that he has been trying to ration that.
[00:39:57.322 --> 00:40:00.564]  So I know Texas governor and others have gone to directly now get it.
[00:40:01.224 --> 00:40:05.267]  What do you make of that action by the president, the so-called president?
[00:40:06.307 --> 00:40:07.168]  Inexcusable.
[00:40:07.828 --> 00:40:11.691]  And there's many other adjectives and words that could be used as well.
[00:40:12.287 --> 00:40:18.893]  But I'll tell you what, don't discriminate against somebody, against an American, just because he lives in Texas or Florida.
[00:40:19.493 --> 00:40:21.595]  Don't discriminate because they've been vaccinated.
[00:40:21.875 --> 00:40:29.101]  There was also talk about not allowing the vaccinated to receive this potentially life-saving medicine.
[00:40:29.121 --> 00:40:32.584]  70% decrease in death if you receive the monoclonal antibody infusion.
[00:40:33.004 --> 00:40:36.887]  Why would you withhold that from an American, whether he's vaccinated or not?
[00:40:37.448 --> 00:40:41.191]  Why would you withhold that from an American that lives in a certain state?
[00:40:42.141 --> 00:40:44.422]  So this is insanity.
[00:40:44.802 --> 00:40:46.023]  This is crazy.
[00:40:49.665 --> 00:41:00.350]  Thank God for DeSantis leading the way again of problem solving and making sure his people, under his influence in Florida, had a workaround and they got monoclonal antibodies from a different source.
[00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:04.832]  And congratulations to Governor Abbott for doing the same for Texas.
[00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:08.654]  We have what we need here in West Texas, where I am.
[00:41:09.178 --> 00:41:13.578]   And, uh, but that decreases the risk of hospitalization or death by 70%.
[00:41:13.578 --> 00:41:16.658]  Budesonide decreases the risk of hospitalization.
[00:41:16.658 --> 00:41:22.258]  90% Coward Stern did us a favor when he mentioned Budesonide.
[00:41:22.258 --> 00:41:29.098]   Coward Stern who hides in a costume of a wig and glasses did us a favor when he
[00:41:29.098 --> 00:41:32.498]   mentioned my name, because people will do an online search and they'll come
[00:41:32.498 --> 00:41:34.697]  across some lifesaving treatment.
[00:41:34.697 --> 00:41:37.978]   I was meaning to make that point, but you made it better than I would.
[00:41:38.017 --> 00:41:40.857]  I mean, this is how no weapon form against us shall prosper.
[00:41:40.857 --> 00:41:43.178]  How his attack is now being turned towards good.
[00:41:43.178 --> 00:41:45.018]  And in closing, I wanted to say this.
[00:41:46.269 --> 00:41:48.890]  We're going to go to break, come back and get Dr. Richard Bartlett's take on that.
[00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:52.909]   I want to ask you when we come back, Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug
[00:41:52.909 --> 00:41:55.829]  that's suspiciously similar to horse paste.
[00:41:55.829 --> 00:42:00.210]   And it turns out right here in the article, ladies and gentlemen, they go on to link and admit
[00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:03.349]   it's got basically some of the same ingredients of ivermectin.
[00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:04.188]  Wow.
[00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:09.268]   We're going to go to break, come back and get Dr. Richard Bartlett's take on that.
[00:42:09.268 --> 00:42:15.429]   And then we've got a loaded group of guests joining us today, including Dr. Zylenko.
[00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:18.108]  He'll be with us for the last hour and a half of the show.
[00:42:18.108 --> 00:42:20.750]  And we've got so much more I'm gonna hit.
[00:42:20.775 --> 00:42:31.767]  We also have a Texas judge, a George Soros-funded judge, literally beyond the kangaroo court, because at least, again, in Australia, they'd have a fake jury of kangaroos as the joke.
[00:42:32.728 --> 00:42:39.751]  She said, I don't get a jury trial on the Sandy Hook defamation case because I would, you know, win that because what they say I've done, I haven't done.
[00:42:40.051 --> 00:42:40.591]  First Amendment.
[00:42:41.452 --> 00:42:45.273]  So she says I'm defaulted and that she's going to decide.
[00:42:45.613 --> 00:42:47.874]  So no more jury trials in Democrat-controlled areas.
[00:42:48.394 --> 00:42:49.355]  You ask why I live in Austin?
[00:42:49.695 --> 00:42:51.496]  Well, my family's been here since the 1820s.
[00:42:51.556 --> 00:42:52.616]  What am I supposed to do?
[00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.037]  But I got to get out soon.
[00:42:54.057 --> 00:42:54.577]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:55.486 --> 00:43:02.390]  All right, we're back live, just five minutes left, with our special guest, who I really appreciate joining us, Dr. Bartlett.
[00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:16.097]  Dr. Bartlett, looking at Pfizer coming out and saying, oh, we want a pill you take twice a day to protect you from COVID, and then we go look at it, and it's got some of the same underlying ingredients and mechanisms as being reported.
[00:43:16.717 --> 00:43:19.619]  A protease inhibitor, am I saying that wrong?
[00:43:19.959 --> 00:43:21.460]  What's going on here, and what do you make of this?
[00:43:22.267 --> 00:43:34.311]  Okay, so a year, over a year ago, I said we have early, effective, inexpensive, safe, readily available treatment strategies for COVID.
[00:43:34.871 --> 00:43:48.795]  Why are we even talking about a vaccine is what I said, but why would we be talking about expensive, experimental medicines when we have generic, readily available, inexpensive, safe medicines that are already proven to be effective?
[00:43:49.335 --> 00:43:50.996]  Why would I say it's effective?
[00:43:51.096 --> 00:43:52.036]  Howard Stern, listen.
[00:43:52.711 --> 00:43:55.933]  Stoic trial, a randomized controlled trial.
[00:43:56.514 --> 00:44:00.737]  The principal trial, a randomized controlled trial by Oxford University.
[00:44:01.077 --> 00:44:04.720]  They've been around since 1096, the oldest university in the English-speaking world.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.381]  You know, Dr. Zelenko is a hero.
[00:44:07.842 --> 00:44:14.306]  He's the one who first had the courage to say, hey, I'm treating this with early effective outpatient treatment.
[00:44:14.807 --> 00:44:15.427]  And you know what?
[00:44:16.208 --> 00:44:17.108]  Kudos to him.
[00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:17.889]  He's right.
[00:44:18.269 --> 00:44:19.510]  That's the winning strategy.
[00:44:20.054 --> 00:44:30.024]  When we were told in January to hide, shelter in place by Fauci until he comes up with a vaccine, and that was his strategy that he presented to the world.
[00:44:31.385 --> 00:44:38.052]  We're talking about the guy who's been chasing a vaccine against HIV for over 30 years and failed over and over and over again.
[00:44:38.472 --> 00:44:44.138]  We're going to trust him and follow him to come up with something when he's failed at that same strategy over and over?
[00:44:45.387 --> 00:44:56.612]  I think the other thing I want to mention real quick is I've heard that all these deaths and disabilities that are happening from the shot are because we've never had this many people vaccinated before.
[00:44:57.373 --> 00:44:57.833]  B.S.
[00:44:58.893 --> 00:45:00.234]  That's how we call it in Texas.
[00:45:01.134 --> 00:45:09.878]  I have been practicing for 30 years and I've been taking care of people who have been vaccinated to polio, measles, mumps, rubella.
[00:45:10.238 --> 00:45:17.227]   I have never taken care of a vaccination injury Like I am now to the COVID shot.
[00:45:17.827 --> 00:45:26.591]  I have been the ER doctor taking care of people who have had strokes, Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, where their spinal cord is hit.
[00:45:27.432 --> 00:45:31.014]  They've become pulmonary cripples because they right after receiving the shot.
[00:45:31.594 --> 00:45:35.676]  I have seen every one of these and been the doctor taking care of them in the emergency room.
[00:45:36.056 --> 00:45:43.000]  I have never had patients who have received other vaccines coming in the ER with these conditions.
[00:45:43.823 --> 00:45:50.506]  And finally, you know, we have 330 million Americans.
[00:45:50.766 --> 00:45:55.068]  Every one of them had to get shots, including the tetanus shot periodically, which is a vaccine.
[00:45:55.669 --> 00:46:01.191]  I have never seen anybody with a tetanus shot come in with any of those conditions that I just described.
[00:46:01.632 --> 00:46:04.433]  But I guarantee there are more people that have received a tetanus shot.
[00:46:05.655 --> 00:46:07.637]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:46:07.677 --> 00:46:19.367]  Well, I mean, take this, even the British government and the Scottish government, all of them are reporting, including the U.S., their own doctors are saying, officially, statistics, this specific type of heart attacks from blood clots is up 25%.
[00:46:20.948 --> 00:46:21.148]  Right.
[00:46:21.509 --> 00:46:25.452]  So, we've never seen that with the polio vaccine.
[00:46:26.313 --> 00:46:28.174]  Coward sterns.
[00:46:28.234 --> 00:46:30.076]  Take off the wig and the glasses and think.
[00:46:30.316 --> 00:46:31.137]  Get a little sunlight.
[00:46:32.838 --> 00:46:43.346]  Listen, I challenge Howard Stearns to join me on Alex Jones' show, Imp Awards, and we'll have a discussion, and we'll see how that goes.
[00:46:44.147 --> 00:46:47.090]  Well, he'll probably just have a puppet piece about you, he does that with me.
[00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:50.692]  It's very sad to see him, I believe, take money to put the talking point out.
[00:46:50.993 --> 00:46:54.195]  It's very sick, and they obviously don't want you promoting sites.
[00:46:54.255 --> 00:47:00.761]  I know it's not your site, you don't sell it, but where's the best place for people to go if they can't find a doctor that actually cares about them?
[00:47:01.308 --> 00:47:02.109]  Here's what they need.
[00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:11.755]  There are many people that are saving lives, including Dr. Zelenko in New York and Ben Marble in Florida, both nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, appropriately so.
[00:47:13.156 --> 00:47:23.003]  And so there's SynergyHealthDPC.com is an online telemedicine service that is using my protocol.
[00:47:23.183 --> 00:47:26.386]  SynergyHealthDPC.com and BudesonineWorks.com.
[00:47:30.023 --> 00:47:35.186]  Alright, God bless you and thank you for saving my dad.
[00:47:35.206 --> 00:47:36.286]  He was gonna die for sure.
[00:47:36.306 --> 00:47:37.487]  82% oxygen.
[00:47:37.527 --> 00:47:37.847]  Amazing.
[00:47:37.867 --> 00:47:38.728]  And thanks for helping my mom.
[00:47:38.968 --> 00:47:39.729]  And thanks for helping me.
[00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:40.509]  God bless you, sir.
[00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.889]  Thank you.
[00:47:40.909 --> 00:47:45.112]  Alright, God bless you.
[00:47:45.152 --> 00:47:45.612]  Thank you, sir.
[00:47:45.672 --> 00:47:46.273]  There it goes!
[00:47:47.421 --> 00:47:48.061]  That's not criminal.
[00:47:48.461 --> 00:47:51.662]  A month ago, we sold out of our first shipment in only three days.
[00:47:52.123 --> 00:47:56.044]  It is Rainforce Ultra, the cleanest, purest energy you're going to find anywhere.

[00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:54.559]   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome, and thank you for joining us in hour number two.
[00:48:54.559 --> 00:48:57.559]  You're the reason we're still on air.
[00:48:57.228 --> 00:48:58.849]  You're the reason we've reached so many people.
[00:48:59.429 --> 00:49:06.094]  I want to make an announcement here before I hit just the incredible news this hour after we had Dr. Richard Bartlett on joining us last hour.
[00:49:07.115 --> 00:49:14.300]  With you just joined us, they now have released the ingredients on Pfizer's new miracle pill that cures COVID.
[00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:16.802]  Cybermectin.
[00:49:19.793 --> 00:49:23.975]  I'm sorry, that's just one of like 500 stories that are just as insane.
[00:49:24.115 --> 00:49:25.496]  I mean, I'm totally overwhelmed.
[00:49:25.576 --> 00:49:29.758]  I know you're overloaded because everything they do is just being exposed to fraud.
[00:49:31.699 --> 00:49:34.101]  Unbelievable.
[00:49:35.682 --> 00:49:41.325]  It's like they prove fish oil and krill oil helps with heart attacks and your brain and your health and your skin.
[00:49:41.665 --> 00:49:47.808]  And so now they're patenting fish oil and coming out with $200 bottles of fish oil that your doctor prescribes.
[00:49:47.868 --> 00:49:49.009]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[00:49:52.128 --> 00:49:56.931]  But if we weren't exposing this, if you weren't spreading the word, they wouldn't even be coming out with that.
[00:49:56.971 --> 00:49:57.711]  They'd just block it.
[00:49:59.512 --> 00:50:00.693]  Yeah, there's the Drudge Report headline.
[00:50:01.073 --> 00:50:03.435]  Oh my gosh, a pill that cuts the death rate in half.
[00:50:03.615 --> 00:50:06.276]  If you get to it early, it's almost 100%.
[00:50:06.316 --> 00:50:11.239]  And that's what the Japanese National and Tokyo Doctors Association said?
[00:50:14.341 --> 00:50:15.182]  Oh, don't listen to them.
[00:50:15.222 --> 00:50:17.723]  They're just... Don't listen to the last doctor Jones said.
[00:50:17.743 --> 00:50:20.465]  He was just the head of Rick Perry's medical commission for seven years.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.882]  The guy the state goes to for advice on legislation.
[00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:25.442]  Oh!
[00:50:27.884 --> 00:50:30.066]  Oh, now he's Governor Abbott's chief advisor.
[00:50:30.146 --> 00:50:31.767]  You know, just shut up.
[00:50:32.447 --> 00:50:40.774]  So you're the head of the Tokyo Medical Doctor Association and says you've treated, for your doctors, 10,000 people with a 100% success rate of cauteroid with ivermectin.
[00:50:41.234 --> 00:50:42.095]  Shut up!
[00:50:42.335 --> 00:50:47.479]  Howard Stern has a Bozo the Clown hairdo and wears purple John Lennon glasses.
[00:50:49.375 --> 00:50:49.815]  Shut up!
[00:50:50.516 --> 00:50:52.377]  Mick Jagger's jumping around on stage.
[00:50:52.697 --> 00:50:53.678]  He says take the shot.
[00:50:53.898 --> 00:50:55.419]  How about you burn in hell?
[00:50:55.479 --> 00:50:56.040]  How about that?
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:57.601]  Good lord.
[00:50:57.801 --> 00:51:10.650]  Oh, but their answer is arrest all the talk show hosts and sue us and have judges not let us have jury trials and do death penalty sanctions judgments that are supposed to be if you don't even show up to trial.
[00:51:11.872 --> 00:51:12.953]  Because they're desperate.
[00:51:13.754 --> 00:51:15.415]  Because their system's falling apart.
[00:51:16.136 --> 00:51:17.437]  Because they're authoritarians.
[00:51:17.457 --> 00:51:18.938]  And it's because it's all they know.
[00:51:20.319 --> 00:51:26.665]  John Hancock signed his name big and bold on the Declaration of Independence knowing it was either victory or a death sentence.
[00:51:28.006 --> 00:51:29.247]  Now, I don't tempt fate like that.
[00:51:29.727 --> 00:51:33.351]  If I saw the Declaration of Independence, I might have signed it medium-sized.
[00:51:34.335 --> 00:51:48.947]  But you know, at the same time, if God signs your signature big and blesses you and puts you in a position to have the biggest signature on that piece of paper after Donald Trump when it comes to effecting change, you better go ahead and thank God and give God the praise.
[00:51:48.967 --> 00:51:52.851]  I'm going to do that right now and then hit the incredible abortion news beyond clown shows.
[00:51:52.871 --> 00:51:53.511]  It's so serious.
[00:51:53.972 --> 00:51:56.614]  Like vampire comedy hour or something.
[00:51:56.634 --> 00:51:57.695]  But that's coming up next segment.
[00:52:00.407 --> 00:52:15.099]  Because of the listeners keeping us on air and the guest and the history of this show and God working in mysterious ways, I can tell you that we woke up the entire system and strata.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.761]  This show was the main engine.
[00:52:17.781 --> 00:52:31.922]   It was a lot of other folks as well, but we were the main engine of Steve Bannon advising Trump and where Trump went and Miller in the White House and With so many people.
[00:52:33.003 --> 00:52:33.784]  Tucker Carlson.
[00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.084]  Joe Rogan.
[00:52:36.425 --> 00:52:37.726]  To a certain extent, Steven Crowder.
[00:52:37.746 --> 00:52:38.807]  I mean, we've influenced everybody.
[00:52:39.127 --> 00:52:48.153]  And then there I am at Glenn Beck's headquarters, and he gives me a painting, and I talk to a bunch of his crew, and they say, yeah, we can't believe that it's all come true, the stuff you talked about.
[00:52:49.934 --> 00:52:53.216]  And so again, InfoWars has now hit its stride.
[00:52:54.077 --> 00:52:59.593]   We have just now gone into In a three-stage rocket, the third stage.
[00:53:00.474 --> 00:53:01.454]  I mean, we've done it.
[00:53:02.294 --> 00:53:08.335]  The world's in trouble, things are crazy, it's dangerous, and I may have to get killed or put in prison, and I'm ready for that.
[00:53:08.395 --> 00:53:10.716]  I'm not happy about it, I don't like it, but I'm strong.
[00:53:11.236 --> 00:53:19.938]  I mean, I'm going to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, because the alternative is total slavery and separation from God, and I'm not going to be part of that.
[00:53:20.038 --> 00:53:24.008]   I'm not going to take the 20 pieces of silver And serve them.
[00:53:24.068 --> 00:53:28.592]  So the credit goes to God, the credit goes to you, the audience, because you are the info war.
[00:53:28.632 --> 00:53:29.292]  You're not an audience.
[00:53:29.312 --> 00:53:31.014]  You're activists in the arena.
[00:53:31.054 --> 00:53:33.396]  You're men and women in the arena of every race, color, and creed.
[00:53:33.896 --> 00:53:35.958]  I salute you because you're part of the human race and I love you.
[00:53:37.279 --> 00:53:38.680]  This is one hell of a time to be alive.
[00:53:39.621 --> 00:53:43.164]  And I can't go anywhere on the street.
[00:53:43.444 --> 00:53:44.205]  It could be in New York.
[00:53:44.265 --> 00:53:45.666]  It could be in California.
[00:53:45.686 --> 00:53:46.807]  It could be in Dallas, Texas.
[00:53:46.867 --> 00:53:47.548]  It could be anywhere.
[00:53:48.249 --> 00:53:54.425]   And not have Half the people come over and shake my hand and say, you woke us up.
[00:53:54.705 --> 00:53:55.726]  We know it's all real now.
[00:53:55.746 --> 00:53:58.768]  We're not going along with it.
[00:53:59.868 --> 00:54:05.512]  But that's going to cause, on the opposite side, insane levels of hatred and viciousness.
[00:54:06.173 --> 00:54:07.934]  So that's why I've committed myself into God's hands.
[00:54:07.954 --> 00:54:10.795]  And I've said that many times, but I'm really committed into God's hands.
[00:54:11.796 --> 00:54:19.295]   And only God can lead God and direct me to not Fall apart under this level of pressure, and that's the only reason I'm able to operate is God.
[00:54:19.795 --> 00:54:24.917]  Because I have the energy and the will to fight these people, but I'm human, so it fails the way it comes out.
[00:54:25.437 --> 00:54:29.919]  So I'm trying to align myself with God and to transcend these globalist Satanists.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:38.963]  And that I forgive them and I feel sorry for them, but I still fight them with all my vigor and oppose them, but understand that they're the losers.
[00:54:40.424 --> 00:54:51.376]  And they know that, and they're desperately trying to claw us down into their anti-human, vampirous, child molestation world.
[00:54:52.438 --> 00:54:55.081]  And it's our job to fight them.
[00:54:55.121 --> 00:54:56.202]  It's our job to expose them.
[00:54:56.242 --> 00:54:58.324]  It's our job to stand against them.
[00:54:59.953 --> 00:55:04.057]  To do it from a position of strength and clarity and focus.
[00:55:04.237 --> 00:55:05.938]  And a lot of times, I'm angry.
[00:55:05.958 --> 00:55:06.859]  A lot of times I'm ranting and raving.
[00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:07.640]  I know that.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.042]  When I say this to you, I'm saying it to me.
[00:55:11.022 --> 00:55:25.675]  But I want to be what King David talked about, in that place, that quiet place of the Most High, where I get all the time, where I understand the world and the universe and can see into the future, just like you can do, when you get in that high, calm place with the Holy Spirit.
[00:55:26.584 --> 00:55:34.147]  Not the comforter of the Holy Spirit, not the love you have with God, not the amazingness to touch infinity and how sublime that is.
[00:55:34.187 --> 00:55:35.848]  That's for babies, and that's great.
[00:55:37.568 --> 00:55:39.789]  And any of us that have a relationship with God, that's a total gift.
[00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:43.391]  We can snap our fingers and be in that presence of the comforter.
[00:55:45.752 --> 00:55:46.692]  God being our Father.
[00:55:46.852 --> 00:55:51.414]  But there's also the next level, the quiet place of the Most High.
[00:55:52.268 --> 00:55:55.810]  In God's court, in God's presence, in the mission.
[00:55:56.391 --> 00:55:58.452]  And then you stare into infinity.
[00:55:59.012 --> 00:56:01.174]  And our enemies know we can stare into infinity.
[00:56:01.574 --> 00:56:08.659]  They know they have sold all that connection to God off for pathetic, temporal, disgusting power.
[00:56:08.679 --> 00:56:17.925]  So they wear festooned outfits and black robes and the Pope's garb and just all of this to try to make us look like they're separate from us on a higher plane.
[00:56:18.185 --> 00:56:23.731]   They are separate from us on another plane, but it's not A higher plane close to God.
[00:56:23.811 --> 00:56:26.736]  It is a plane in our third dimensional thought below us.
[00:56:28.979 --> 00:56:31.403]  Like the creepy crawly things that live under rocks.
[00:56:32.465 --> 00:56:35.349]  So take joy when they persecute you.
[00:56:36.448 --> 00:56:38.249]  Because that means you're over the target.
[00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:40.752]  Again, they didn't have radar at the start of World War II.
[00:56:41.472 --> 00:56:47.937]  And a few years into it, they were flying the Liberators and the B-17s and the planes into Germany and other areas to drop bombs on them.
[00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:50.179]  They would go towards the flak.
[00:56:50.259 --> 00:56:52.241]  And the Germans wouldn't put up, you know, fake flak over here.
[00:56:52.261 --> 00:56:55.503]  They'd put the real stuff up and put the smoke in the air and all the rest of it.
[00:56:55.563 --> 00:56:57.325]  And so you're like, your radar was the enemy.
[00:56:58.065 --> 00:57:02.909]  And so you just have to kind of like in a fight, forget about what you're doing and win it.
[00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:08.017]   And just bear down and commit And flip the switch.
[00:57:08.877 --> 00:57:09.618]  And so that's it!
[00:57:09.918 --> 00:57:10.798]  And I flipped the switch.
[00:57:11.199 --> 00:57:14.080]  In fact, I even see persecution now as a blessing.
[00:57:14.661 --> 00:57:17.503]  I'm not a masochist or a sadomasochist, but...
[00:57:18.678 --> 00:57:22.280]  Now, I understand that I just need a fire lit under my ass.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.762]  And with all the things, with whatever you see going on against us, that's the tip of the iceberg.
[00:57:26.802 --> 00:57:30.203]  I mean, they've done things far worse to me than what you see in the news.
[00:57:30.723 --> 00:57:33.324]  And that's okay, because it's the strangest thing.
[00:57:33.364 --> 00:57:35.505]  When I was younger, you'd have a deep pain in your heart.
[00:57:36.126 --> 00:57:38.487]  It was, you didn't like it.
[00:57:39.787 --> 00:57:44.849]  But, now that pain is a strength, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:45.289 --> 00:57:56.591]   That pain is not something that I operate off of, but new pains are not like the even greater deep pains, and so it's almost like a pleasure.
[00:57:57.651 --> 00:57:59.413]  And that's transcendence.
[00:58:00.113 --> 00:58:00.894]  That's transcendence.
[00:58:00.934 --> 00:58:05.097]  And I know God's testing how much I can take, because God doesn't give us tasks we can't take.
[00:58:05.578 --> 00:58:08.440]  God's getting me ready for even greater tasks and greater pain.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.741]  And so I say, that's God's will.
[00:58:11.262 --> 00:58:12.123]  Give me the pain.
[00:58:12.803 --> 00:58:13.784]  I want the full mission.
[00:58:15.545 --> 00:58:16.846]  It's Friday, October 1st.
[00:58:18.445 --> 00:58:23.589]  Dr. Zelenko will be joining us coming up at 1.30 central until 3 p.m.
[00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.690]  central.
[00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:35.919]  I'll be hosting the fourth hour with him and he's been calling again for Nuremberg 2 and for new actions against the globalists as the evidence is completely confirmed by the National Health Services here in the U.S.
[00:58:36.019 --> 00:58:36.599]  and the U.K.
[00:58:36.639 --> 00:58:41.823]  as well as in Europe that there is a 25% increase in Europe, the U.K.
[00:58:41.883 --> 00:58:42.464]  and the U.S.
[00:58:44.028 --> 00:58:58.441]  25% increase in a type of heart attack in young people from blood clots, which they said in October of last year, they feared this so-called vaccine would cause, and it's now a warning on the damn insert.
[00:58:58.461 --> 00:59:02.885]  Of course, they knew this from studies previously with similar injections that would do this.
[00:59:03.826 --> 00:59:05.627]  They got a lot of nerve, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:07.669 --> 00:59:09.491]  And a lot of folks that don't die are gonna die later.
[00:59:10.598 --> 00:59:12.739]  And that's where we tell you about soft kill weapons.
[00:59:12.899 --> 00:59:17.362]  They've already done animal studies and in China, human studies with these things before they launch them on us.
[00:59:18.243 --> 00:59:21.104]  So they know it's going to happen over time.
[00:59:21.465 --> 00:59:23.466]  And so it's not all one clear way it happens.
[00:59:23.486 --> 00:59:26.688]  Just like autism is hundreds of different types of things on the spectrum.
[00:59:26.708 --> 00:59:35.893]  But in the studies, we know it's the injections that along with pesticides and things that males aren't as strong against.
[00:59:35.993 --> 00:59:37.014]  Males are geared different.
[00:59:37.354 --> 00:59:39.916]  We have half the blood brain barrier of a female.
[00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:43.271]  Females don't reject things as easy.
[00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:50.553]  They can handle, they're not physically as strong as a male in like lifting weights or fighting, but women are stronger than males.
[00:59:50.953 --> 00:59:58.354]  In fact, in any mammal species, when it comes to wounds and things like that, because they have to grow a baby inside of them.
[00:59:58.374 --> 00:59:59.095]  Women are tough.
[01:00:00.775 --> 01:00:03.295]  See women, doctors will tell you, with 10 bullet wounds and they live.
[01:00:03.356 --> 01:00:04.796]  A man, one bullet wound a lot of times kills him.
[01:00:05.196 --> 01:00:07.116]  Because men go into shock easier and die easier.
[01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:07.896]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:00:08.216 --> 01:00:10.217]  Boys can't handle all the poison, women can't.
[01:00:11.087 --> 01:00:13.668]  Women are designed to be able to take more poison than males.
[01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:16.309]  But that's just a medical known fact.
[01:00:16.369 --> 01:00:17.190]  It's not debatable.
[01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:22.392]  And that's why you have nine out of 10 autistic being boys.
[01:00:23.112 --> 01:00:25.913]  But if a girl gets enough poison, she's autistic as well.
[01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:28.535]  So all of it cocktails together.
[01:00:28.615 --> 01:00:29.255]  That's the facts.
[01:00:30.035 --> 01:00:37.638]  And they've been successfully carrying that out against us with the hydrofluorosilic acid, not the calcium fluoride that you do need some of, and it's good for you.
[01:00:37.859 --> 01:00:38.479]  Very small amount.
[01:00:40.478 --> 01:00:46.347]  Or the trace elements you do need a little bit of, but you do not need hydrofluorosilic acid.
[01:00:46.367 --> 01:00:53.297]  It lowers IQ and fertility, and that's why Europe just announced, and the UK, oh, we're going to fluoridate your water, too, to make you submit.
[01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:58.706]  They have brought us into the incredible world of gaslighting.
[01:00:59.467 --> 01:01:04.549]  And I watched some of this hearing yesterday, and the crew got even more clips for me that I hadn't seen until this morning.
[01:01:05.169 --> 01:01:07.991]  And these are just next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:09.171 --> 01:01:12.833]  And so let's just let these speak for themselves, then I'll give you my take in the next segment.
[01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:18.296]  I got a little special clip from Steven Crowder's amazingly funny and highly produced show.
[01:01:18.336 --> 01:01:22.818]  Man, I'm sitting there watching a two-hour live show, and I was part of the show for an hour.
[01:01:23.948 --> 01:01:28.972]  And the production and the precision, and they do it four days a week live with a small crew.
[01:01:28.992 --> 01:01:35.738]  It was better than Saturday Night Live, and it was a crew 120 at the size.
[01:01:35.978 --> 01:01:36.639]  Simply amazing.
[01:01:36.899 --> 01:01:39.742]  I mean, even if he was a leftist, I'd say this guy's got incredible talent, but he's not.
[01:01:40.482 --> 01:01:45.487]  So that's why you look at all the aggregates and the numbers, he's as big as Tucker Carlson worldwide.
[01:01:45.847 --> 01:01:47.728]  So congratulations to Steven Crowder.
[01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:49.010]  He just gets better and better.
[01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:51.352]  That makes me feel good at night knowing there's people like that out there.
[01:01:52.285 --> 01:01:53.546]  But that's coming up next segment.
[01:01:53.566 --> 01:02:03.816]  But let's go ahead and get to Democrat Dems call killing babies in womb a blessing, an act of love, as they protest Texas abortion law.
[01:02:05.097 --> 01:02:09.220]  And let's just start with abortion activist Malisha Azee.
[01:02:10.361 --> 01:02:13.364]  As we know, people get pregnant and are not just women.
[01:02:13.664 --> 01:02:14.025]  Here it is.
[01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:18.956]  I want to start by saying I do not regret either of my abortions.
[01:02:19.216 --> 01:02:21.976]  I do regret my experience at the Crisis Pregnancy Center.
[01:02:22.996 --> 01:02:34.519]  The most traumatic part of my experience was one of those centers and how I was treated there and I hope that they all shut down because they exist to manipulate and prey on vulnerable pregnant people.
[01:02:34.999 --> 01:02:42.240]  And I just wanted to acknowledge a lot of people are being left out of this conversation today because as we know people get pregnant and not just women.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:50.226]  But I hear people over and over and over again say women get pregnant, but that's excluding people that should be a part of this conversation.
[01:02:51.127 --> 01:03:02.916]  As for the Crisis Pregnancy Center... And then she goes on, the same lady, to reverse reality and say, those that don't want to abort people are elitist and want to attack poor people and are racist.
[01:03:03.636 --> 01:03:10.642]  Uh, no, sweetheart, it's the Rockefellers and Margaret Sanger that think brown people are weeds that said they wanted to kill you and they set up Planned Parenthood to make sure you were never born.
[01:03:12.361 --> 01:03:16.645]  And now, since you live, they just turned you into one of their mind control slaves to try to kill other people.
[01:03:16.685 --> 01:03:17.726]  I guess you'll get rid of more babies.
[01:03:18.326 --> 01:03:19.127]  So, here it is.
[01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.633]  Before SB8 officially became the law, things were already dismal.
[01:03:26.194 --> 01:03:28.396]  But now, they have become a nightmare.
[01:03:29.617 --> 01:03:37.384]  Abortion funds have been working around the clock to help people access abortions with funding assistance, travel support, and more.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:48.328]  Abortion funds exist to counter the discriminatory, classist, and racist restrictions on abortion, like the Hyde Amendment and SB-8.
[01:03:49.689 --> 01:03:59.257]  The authors of SB-8 and the people supporting this discriminatory and despicable law have made it abundantly clear that they do not care about our physical and emotional well-being.
[01:04:00.178 --> 01:04:02.720]  They are only interested in controlling our bodies.
[01:04:04.292 --> 01:04:08.795]  As a survivor, I know this feeling all too well, and it fills me with rage.
[01:04:10.495 --> 01:04:11.296]  A survivor?
[01:04:11.316 --> 01:04:13.777]  They're all survivors, except the babies they killed.
[01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:15.378]  They're not humans.
[01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:16.779]  They're an act of love.
[01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:18.180]  We got that clip coming up.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:26.744]  Here's Representative Ray Rahana saying it's unpatriotic for people to create false impression that Margaret Singer had racist motives.
[01:04:27.025 --> 01:04:29.866]  She just called black people weeds that should be exterminated.
[01:04:29.886 --> 01:04:32.107]  I guess that's not racist.
[01:04:32.127 --> 01:04:32.448]  You're right.
[01:04:32.488 --> 01:04:32.808]  Here it is.
[01:04:33.547 --> 01:04:47.431]  Senator Fox suggested that, this absurd suggestion, that Planned Parenthood was somehow conceived to encourage abortions in the African American community.
[01:04:48.291 --> 01:04:52.112]  I suggest reading an 8th grade history book as a starter.
[01:04:52.172 --> 01:05:07.862]   First of all, Yeah, no.
[01:05:07.922 --> 01:05:14.827]  They were doing forced abortions and sterilizations of poor blacks and whites all over Europe, all over the UK, and all over the US and Mexico.
[01:05:15.367 --> 01:05:16.508]  He just thinks you're dumb.
[01:05:16.548 --> 01:05:18.369]  There's whole books, films on it.
[01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:22.692]  The Nazis used Margaret Singer's books and writings as their defense in the Nuremberg.
[01:05:23.232 --> 01:05:23.612]  Trials.
[01:05:24.933 --> 01:05:25.713]  Go back to it, please.
[01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:34.036]  And she says in her letters to different foundations, like the Rockefellers, I need money to hire and groom and prepare blacks to go in and help us get rid of the weeds.
[01:05:33.856 --> 01:05:34.856]  It's fine now.
[01:05:34.856 --> 01:05:35.856]  I can pack it up.
[01:05:35.856 --> 01:05:40.056]   Yeah, and she says in her letters to different foundations, like the Rockefellers, I need
[01:05:40.056 --> 01:05:46.775]   money to hire and groom and prepare blacks to go in and help us get rid of the weeds.
[01:05:46.775 --> 01:05:49.016]  Du Bois was a communist.
[01:05:49.016 --> 01:05:50.895]  Good, let's all admit it.
[01:05:51.643 --> 01:05:54.687]  But see, her name has now been dropped by New York City Clinic over eugenics.
[01:05:54.967 --> 01:05:55.788]  Even ABC News.
[01:05:56.009 --> 01:06:00.094]  But this guy, because he's got brown skin, he can now resuscitate a Hitler lover.
[01:05:59.934 --> 01:06:00.934]  Here it is.
[01:06:00.934 --> 01:06:05.573]   Boy, one of the great civil rights leader was an advisor to Sanger.
[01:06:05.573 --> 01:06:12.094]   So it's fine to have ideological differences, but it is really sad that people are saying
[01:06:12.094 --> 01:06:15.054]  things that are a misreading of American history.
[01:06:15.448 --> 01:06:19.392]  Frankly, pretty unpatriotic that you don't take the time to read American history.
[01:06:20.973 --> 01:06:21.754]  That's gaslighting.
[01:06:21.794 --> 01:06:25.376]  If we read American history, we know all about it, buddy, and we know that you're a big fat liar.
[01:06:25.476 --> 01:06:25.937]  Incredible.
[01:06:27.038 --> 01:06:28.719]  Absolutely amazing gaslighting.
[01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:32.442]  I mean, that's like saying the sun does not rise in the morning and set in the evening.
[01:06:32.502 --> 01:06:33.263]  It's not yellow.
[01:06:34.665 --> 01:06:35.788]  It won't burn your skin.
[01:06:36.429 --> 01:06:37.351]  Water's not wet.
[01:06:37.752 --> 01:06:38.654]  They just lie.
[01:06:38.975 --> 01:06:39.256]  Lie.
[01:06:39.456 --> 01:06:41.080]  Because they're pissed it's coming out who they are.
[01:06:41.977 --> 01:06:44.318]  The left are the people that created Hitler.
[01:06:44.938 --> 01:06:45.998]  Hitler was a leftist.
[01:06:46.018 --> 01:06:48.719]  The Rockefellers created Cold Springs Harbor, and then the Nazis.
[01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:51.560]  We are fighting for you.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800]  We are fighting for ourselves.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.601]  We're fighting for our families.
[01:06:53.621 --> 01:06:55.381]  We're all in this together.
[01:06:56.101 --> 01:07:05.504]  And InfoWars, I can tell you, is always at the tip of the spear, thanks to your support and your prayers, listeners, and you're amplifying our message by spreading our articles, our videos, our reports.
[01:07:06.725 --> 01:07:07.305]  And here it is.
[01:07:08.627 --> 01:07:20.477]  I learned about this yesterday and I said Norm Pattis, one of the top lawyers in the country, criminal lawyer, civil lawyer, First Amendment lawyer, you know, right there up at the Alan Dershowitz level, right there at the Jerry Spence level.
[01:07:20.497 --> 01:07:22.359]  In fact, he represents Mr. Spence.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:28.564]  New York health workers win religious exemption to vaccine mandate.
[01:07:28.624 --> 01:07:30.446]  Bloomberg breaking last night.
[01:07:30.806 --> 01:07:31.907]  But you don't hear about this.
[01:07:32.941 --> 01:07:34.263]  And so that's what's going on.
[01:07:34.323 --> 01:07:35.644]  That's what's unfolding.
[01:07:36.225 --> 01:07:42.832]  And Norm Padas joins us now, my lawyer, in the first minute as well, to break down what's happening.
[01:07:42.872 --> 01:07:45.415]  So you're just a very busy man.
[01:07:45.475 --> 01:07:46.376]  I'm glad you did this.
[01:07:46.937 --> 01:07:49.120]  Tell us the current information on what's going on.
[01:07:50.233 --> 01:08:06.894]  So New York passed a piece of legislation without notice or comment requiring that all healthcare workers get vaccinated and it permitted a health-related or a medical exemption but no religious exemption.
[01:08:07.412 --> 01:08:12.296]  And so we challenged that in the Eastern District of New York Federal Court in Brooklyn.
[01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:15.779]  The judge threw us out within an hour of the paper being filed.
[01:08:16.119 --> 01:08:31.652]  So we went to the Federal Appellate Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City, one step below the Supreme Court, and we asked for an emergency stay, an order blocking imposition of that regulation because it disadvantaged people of faith.
[01:08:32.693 --> 01:08:35.335]  And the appellate court gave us an emergency stay.
[01:08:35.355 --> 01:08:37.316]  It granted that yesterday afternoon.
[01:08:37.737 --> 01:08:42.901]  Now we will go to a full merits briefing and we'll have arguments on October 14th on the issue.
[01:08:43.201 --> 01:08:44.282]  But here's what's at stake.
[01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:51.708]  When evaluating a government action that burdens the First Amendment, the courts use what's called a strict scrutiny test.
[01:08:52.108 --> 01:08:55.771]  In other words, does the government have a compelling interest in doing what it did?
[01:08:56.251 --> 01:09:02.792]   And if it does have a compelling interest, is that it offers narrowly tailored to accomplishing that.
[01:09:02.792 --> 01:09:08.372]   We acknowledge the compelling interest in public health, but we say it makes absolutely no sense
[01:09:08.372 --> 01:09:14.072]   to say that religious people can't be exempt from the vaccine while people with medical reasons can.
[01:09:14.072 --> 01:09:17.431]  The virus doesn't care how it hops from person to person.
[01:09:17.431 --> 01:09:19.712]  A person with a medical exemption can go to work.
[01:09:19.712 --> 01:09:22.072]  Why shouldn't religious people be able to go to work?
[01:09:22.072 --> 01:09:26.751]   And so we had a number of clients approach us who were people of faith and believe
[01:09:26.751 --> 01:09:29.271]  that they would lose their job under this exemption.
[01:09:29.271 --> 01:09:35.712]   So we are challenging this as a misapplication and violation, frankly, of the First Amendment
[01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:38.193]  and a misapplication to the state's police power.
[01:09:38.193 --> 01:09:40.552]  In other words, New York overreached.
[01:09:40.552 --> 01:09:42.153]  And here's a chilling example.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.800]   example of what's at stake. Governor Hochul, the unelected mayor of New York City who replaced
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:56.159]   Governor Cuomo when he resigned, said earlier in the week, "Look, God wants you to get vaccinated.
[01:09:56.159 --> 01:10:01.800]   Be a good apostle. Get vaccinated." My view is that is breathtaking arrogance on behalf
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.800]  of the Empire State.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.519]   Is that an attempt to establish state-run religion in violation of the First Amendment?
[01:10:07.394 --> 01:10:08.755]  It sounds just crazy to me.
[01:10:08.795 --> 01:10:14.161]  I don't want my governor or my elected officials telling me they've talked to God and God tells me what to do.
[01:10:14.261 --> 01:10:20.688]  It sounds like a science fiction movie where like a crazy woman's like, we will all take the injection, but those that don't are not listening to God.
[01:10:20.968 --> 01:10:22.510]  We must go out and confront them.
[01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:25.413]  I mean, this is like I'm watching an old 1980s horror movie.
[01:10:27.994 --> 01:10:29.994]  There's a lot going on in New England, Alex.
[01:10:29.994 --> 01:10:31.554]  Let me tell you what's going on in Connecticut.
[01:10:31.554 --> 01:10:35.954]   If you think Governor Hochul is crazy, wait till you hear what Ned Lamont is doing.
[01:10:35.954 --> 01:10:41.074]   There's a new mandate that requires state employees to get vaccinated.
[01:10:41.074 --> 01:10:44.353]   If they don't, they can be fired as early as midnight Monday.
[01:10:44.353 --> 01:10:51.434]   The governor in Connecticut is mobilizing the National Guard to fill the position of state workers who are
[01:10:51.434 --> 01:10:54.114]  discharged as a result of not getting vaccinated.
[01:10:54.114 --> 01:10:59.714]   We have an enormous and long tradition in this country of suspicion of the military.
[01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:02.302]  We didn't want a permanent military at the time of the founding.
[01:11:02.582 --> 01:11:05.203]  We always have prided ourselves on civilian rule.
[01:11:05.723 --> 01:11:15.246]  I can't believe that in my home state of Connecticut, my governor is prepared to put men in uniform on school buses, presumably bearing sidearms to drive our kids around.
[01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:18.849]  If this happened in a third world country, we'd call it a coup.
[01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:20.811]  What do you want to call it in the United States?
[01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:27.657]  So we've got a governor in Connecticut prepared to mobilize the military to replace people, state workers, who don't get vaccinated.
[01:11:28.037 --> 01:11:32.501]  And we've got a governor in New York who says she's talked to God and God knows what we should do.
[01:11:33.101 --> 01:11:34.883]  What happened to the Constitution?
[01:11:35.263 --> 01:11:36.483]  What happened to the Bill of Rights?
[01:11:36.904 --> 01:11:44.246]  So we're thrilled by the Second Circuit's decision this week to put a stay, that is to block imposition of New York's regulation.
[01:11:44.806 --> 01:11:50.928]  We're hopeful that we'll be able to win it when it's argued on its merits on the 14th of October.
[01:11:51.389 --> 01:11:56.170]  If we don't, we're going to the United States Supreme Court because we are established in this country.
[01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:59.911]  Our government has been established subject to limitations on the Bill of Rights.
[01:12:00.472 --> 01:12:04.373]  My office and I think the people of the United States are proud to stand with Antigone.
[01:12:04.813 --> 01:12:21.293]  The protagonist in Sophocles' play by that name, when she refused to obey the king who would not let her bury her brother because her brother was killed or executed as a result of treason, she said, there are laws higher than yours, king, and I choose to obey those laws.
[01:12:21.773 --> 01:12:34.280]  I think the United States is a country of people free to follow their conscience, and when government tries to tell you what you've got to do in violation of fundamental rights, you, we, we the people, need to fight back.
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:34.901]  Norm, that's right.
[01:12:34.941 --> 01:12:36.962]  There is a higher law and it's written on our hearts.
[01:12:37.622 --> 01:12:39.984]  And when we betray that, we betray ourselves.
[01:12:41.465 --> 01:12:42.466]  Yeah, I think you're dead right.
[01:12:42.506 --> 01:12:43.266]  And that's what's at stake.
[01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:47.669]  I mean, there's an emerging, you know, the people say sometimes they give me a hard time.
[01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:48.830]  Why are you fighting vaccines?
[01:12:48.850 --> 01:12:49.911]  What do you want everybody to die?
[01:12:49.931 --> 01:12:51.011]  Well, of course I don't.
[01:12:51.812 --> 01:12:55.314]  But what I don't want to what I worry about is the precedent these laws set.
[01:12:55.614 --> 01:13:03.680]  You know, we're creating a new nanny state, a new public health state that will can and will be able to do anything in the name of public health and in the name of an emergency.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.121]  So today it's a pandemic.
[01:13:05.421 --> 01:13:06.362]  Tomorrow it's guns.
[01:13:06.422 --> 01:13:11.265]  And we saw the CDC come out this week again with more information and belief about gun violence.
[01:13:11.785 --> 01:13:13.427]  Then it's, so that's the second amendment.
[01:13:13.987 --> 01:13:17.791]  Then we're going to have claims about systemic racism as a public health crisis.
[01:13:18.111 --> 01:13:22.496]  Then we're going to have claims about global climate change as a public health crisis.
[01:13:22.836 --> 01:13:31.705]  When everything becomes a public health crisis and somebody says we've got to act in the common good, that somebody is usually somebody in government who has power.
[01:13:31.725 --> 01:13:33.026]  And Norm, let's expand on that.
[01:13:33.266 --> 01:13:52.299]  We then have Operation Lockstep from the Rockefeller Foundation that literally funded Hitler, literally created the UN, literally created the new policy for the lockdowns worldwide, that's public, that controls Biden's national response, a private foundation of a eugenics, social Darwinistic family.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:14:02.803]  They are now in control of this whole thing and their Operation Lockstep from 2011, they describe using the fear of a virus for everything that's now transpired.
[01:14:03.023 --> 01:14:04.243]  We're facing a battle plan.
[01:14:05.604 --> 01:14:06.264]  I think we are.
[01:14:06.504 --> 01:14:11.305]  And you know, I mean, I hear you talk about globalism and sometimes I understand you, sometimes I don't.
[01:14:11.566 --> 01:14:12.886]  Here's what I think I'm hearing.
[01:14:14.668 --> 01:14:22.356]  And that is that there are elites who have a vision of the common good and they seek to impose that on us in the name of survival or furthering the species.
[01:14:22.636 --> 01:14:25.800]  Somehow they're going to be captains of the Darwinian engine as they see it.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:32.567]  The struggle for human significance, for liberty, for a meaningful life is based on an individual by individual basis.
[01:14:33.067 --> 01:14:34.409]  I live in a small community.
[01:14:34.569 --> 01:14:37.553]  I want to be able to set the meets and bounds of what I can and cannot do.
[01:14:37.894 --> 01:14:39.135]  Government helps me with that.
[01:14:39.456 --> 01:14:40.637]  But I don't want government.
[01:14:40.718 --> 01:14:42.019]  I don't want global government.
[01:14:42.079 --> 01:14:48.067]  I don't want global elites setting norms that I am required to adhere to or I'll lose my job, my liberty, my home.
[01:14:48.368 --> 01:14:48.888]  Exactly!
[01:14:48.949 --> 01:14:50.631]  Even if they cared about us, the...
[01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:56.119]  Top-down implementation would put in a tyranny where their minions could abuse us and usurp us, and they always do.
[01:14:56.399 --> 01:15:01.547]  But this is done from the position of depopulation and world government to carry that out.
[01:15:01.627 --> 01:15:03.871]  So it's designed to be a dystopia.
[01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:06.354]  That's why they're gaslighting us now with this dystopia.
[01:15:07.881 --> 01:15:12.086]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, I've read a lot of utopian literature, dystopian literature this year.
[01:15:12.106 --> 01:15:17.252]  We read it in 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, you know, The Handmaid's Tale by Ed Wood.
[01:15:17.332 --> 01:15:24.244]   And the protagonist in each of these books is usually an individual with application of good old common sense says, This doesn't make sense.
[01:15:24.724 --> 01:15:25.444]  I resist.
[01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:31.247]  I want to have significance on my own terms, and they undermine the elite.
[01:15:31.507 --> 01:15:34.468]  They undermine authority in the name of individual liberty and significance.
[01:15:34.808 --> 01:15:39.690]  What I appreciate so much about InfoWars is that's what you're encouraging your listeners to do.
[01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:45.593]  Find one another, speak out, act out, and don't take an order from a distant elite as an answer.
[01:15:46.073 --> 01:16:06.106]  All right, I don't want to get into the crucifixion of the First Amendment that you talked about in the letter you posted to InfoWars last night with this ruling, but I do want to come back in general and talk about the weaponization of the judiciary and how it's mainly coming from the left and how you think as a rule we as citizens should oppose that with every legal, lawful means.
[01:16:06.506 --> 01:16:09.848]  And then at what point is it time for the new Declaration of Independence?
[01:16:10.188 --> 01:16:11.409]  We'll be right back with Norm Pettus.
[01:16:12.756 --> 01:16:16.759]  And we're going to have to change it on the inside of ourselves and then change the outside of the world.
[01:16:17.119 --> 01:16:18.901]  Norm Pattis has got to go to a very important meeting.
[01:16:18.921 --> 01:16:20.962]  He's leaving us in just about four minutes.
[01:16:21.943 --> 01:16:28.829]  Norm, just in general, I mean, you see yourself, I guess, as a classical liberal, but that means something different today than what liberals are today.
[01:16:28.849 --> 01:16:30.050]  I mean, I'm not putting words in your mouth.
[01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.970]  We talk about it all the time.
[01:16:31.631 --> 01:16:39.177]  What do you see in the judiciary, in the executive, just everywhere, is I see a race towards classical tyranny with a high-tech gravy.
[01:16:40.936 --> 01:16:49.300]  Well, I think the high-tech gravy I certainly see, and I see people increasingly detached, frustrated, and feeling disenfranchised.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.502]  So the courts, for example, have regarded themselves largely immune from criticism.
[01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:58.984]  They've recreated immunities for public officials, so-called qualified immunities in policing.
[01:16:59.725 --> 01:17:02.826]  They've imported immunities into the Constitution that don't exist.
[01:17:02.966 --> 01:17:07.605]   And so while the preamble to the Constitution says that we the people created government
[01:17:07.605 --> 01:17:12.206]   to ensure peace and prosperity and domestic tranquility, the fact of the matter is many
[01:17:12.206 --> 01:17:18.246]   of us feel disenfranchised, alienated and disconnected from the world at large.
[01:17:18.246 --> 01:17:22.525]   Some states elect judges, I know they elect them down in Texas, I think that's a horrible
[01:17:22.525 --> 01:17:26.845]   idea because then you get judges racing to the bottom and pandering to the lowest common
[01:17:26.845 --> 01:17:28.206]  denominator to get some votes.
[01:17:28.224 --> 01:17:37.728]  Oh, I mean, George Soros has put in all the new judges in Travis County, put in the city attorney, the county attorney, and they're literally bomb-throwing maniacs.
[01:17:39.127 --> 01:17:43.592]  Well, Travis County, they ought to sell it to Northern California and let Texans be Texas.
[01:17:43.612 --> 01:17:46.995]  You know, elected judges are a horrible idea.
[01:17:47.015 --> 01:17:50.819]  I think lifetime appointments in the federal courts are good.
[01:17:51.139 --> 01:17:53.501]  But then, you know, you get people who are insulated.
[01:17:53.742 --> 01:17:55.503]  So I think institutions aren't the answer.
[01:17:55.524 --> 01:17:56.825]  Political culture is the answer.
[01:17:57.165 --> 01:17:59.946]  And we don't foster a sense of responsibility anymore.
[01:17:59.966 --> 01:18:00.926]  The United States... I agree.
[01:18:00.946 --> 01:18:06.127]  So how do we declare a new 1776 that's nonviolent, a new Declaration of Independence?
[01:18:06.167 --> 01:18:08.708]  I think you ought to write a new Declaration of Independence.
[01:18:08.728 --> 01:18:09.388]  I think I should write one.
[01:18:09.408 --> 01:18:14.870]  I think all our good thinkers, Joe Rogan, Stephen Crowder, I think everybody should write a Declaration of Independence.
[01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:22.312]  We should have a big conference and then have a million voters and see who votes in the new Declaration of Independence.
[01:18:22.332 --> 01:18:23.472]  And then we all digitally sign it.
[01:18:24.676 --> 01:18:25.776]  That's an excellent idea.
[01:18:25.816 --> 01:18:27.897]  You should call a constitutional convention.
[01:18:27.917 --> 01:18:32.679]  I mean, let's not forget for a moment that at the founding of this country, the Articles of Confederation weren't working.
[01:18:32.799 --> 01:18:37.121]  People met in Philadelphia to amend the Articles of Confederation, but they revolted.
[01:18:37.381 --> 01:18:42.843]  They did something beyond what was called for, and they created a new constitution, a new republic.
[01:18:43.283 --> 01:18:47.006]  Maybe it's time to pour some new wine into the old skins here and see how far it goes.
[01:18:47.026 --> 01:18:47.186]  I agree.
[01:18:47.206 --> 01:19:02.878]  I think if we had liberal conservative top lawyers that are pro-America and Joe Rogan and Steven Crowder and a bunch of scientists and myself and you know have maybe 500 top people there and have our new Constitutional Convention and then put it out to everybody to vote on it.
[01:19:03.198 --> 01:19:05.360]  Boy, I think that would really scare the establishment Norm.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.103]  Because it's just a declaration of will that we the people don't agree with the system.
[01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:11.271]  Call the convention.
[01:19:11.651 --> 01:19:12.812]  I'll appear if invited.
[01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:14.794]  I think it's an excellent idea.
[01:19:14.914 --> 01:19:17.516]  Legitimacy springs from the bottom up, not the top down.
[01:19:17.557 --> 01:19:20.199]  And when it's tried to cram down on the people, they resist.
[01:19:20.559 --> 01:19:22.101]  So let's strike back with the pen.
[01:19:22.481 --> 01:19:24.783]  Let's strike back with expressions of popular will.
[01:19:24.863 --> 01:19:26.244]  And let's recreate the republic.
[01:19:26.605 --> 01:19:28.346]  It happened 200 and some years ago.
[01:19:28.366 --> 01:19:29.507]  It can happen again.
[01:19:29.527 --> 01:19:29.828]  I agree.
[01:19:29.968 --> 01:19:30.969]  One minute, then I gotta go.
[01:19:31.449 --> 01:19:33.291]  Without getting into the stuff in text, we will later.
[01:19:33.991 --> 01:19:36.654]  It's really sad, but also comical at the same time, in my view.
[01:19:37.938 --> 01:19:38.739]  What do you make of it?
[01:19:38.759 --> 01:19:45.724]  In Australia, they say, back when it was a penal colony, they still had juries because that was British common law, but they would put kangaroos on them, I guess.
[01:19:45.904 --> 01:19:50.188]  They call that a kangaroo court where the judge is really there, but has, you know, a rigged jury is the term kangaroo court.
[01:19:50.708 --> 01:19:53.551]  What is it when the judge just gets rid of the jury entirely?
[01:19:54.231 --> 01:20:03.599]  Even the Huffington Post, when it broke that story about me yesterday, said this is really a legal myth and, you know, doesn't really ever apply if someone actually shows up to court.
[01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:06.521]  I think it's like if you just run off and never show up, you can have a default.
[01:20:07.762 --> 01:20:10.663]  Pretty big power grab in my view.
[01:20:11.403 --> 01:20:20.005]  Legal scholars write about the vanishing trial, the extent to which it becomes increasingly more difficult for ordinary people to have ordinary jurors hear their dispute.
[01:20:20.465 --> 01:20:26.547]  Judges have a lot of power to decide questions of law before they get to a jury, and maybe we need to limit that.
[01:20:26.687 --> 01:20:31.948]  Maybe that's one of the things your new constitutional convention will say, and that is there are explicit limits.
[01:20:32.268 --> 01:20:39.453]  If power flows from the people, we want jurors as the people's voice deciding, not just legal issues or factual issues, but legal issues as well.
[01:20:39.473 --> 01:20:40.033]  Well, let's just say it.
[01:20:40.093 --> 01:20:43.656]  You've been doing a lot of stuff and you've been feeling really, really good about these.
[01:20:44.296 --> 01:20:47.599]  And they know they don't have the case they claim, so I don't get to have a jury.
[01:20:47.679 --> 01:20:49.520]  I don't think America is going to put up with that.
[01:20:50.701 --> 01:20:52.982]  I hope you're right, but I think we have thus far.
[01:20:53.262 --> 01:20:57.105]  I think it's time for we, the people, to stand up and say we're mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore.
[01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:59.006]  Norm Pattis of normpattis.com.
[01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:00.487]  And you do your own podcast weekly.
[01:21:00.507 --> 01:21:01.068]  Thank you so much.
[01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:02.745]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:21:02.765 --> 01:21:02.966]  Bye.
[01:21:03.206 --> 01:21:06.408]  By the way, he did a great job on the podcast I did with him last week.
[01:21:06.448 --> 01:21:09.250]  We ought to find his podcast and post it to Band On Video.
[01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:11.452]  I told him I'd give him a channel, and it's very, very popular.
[01:21:11.472 --> 01:21:12.873]  So Norm, you're getting a Band On Video channel.
[01:21:13.473 --> 01:21:16.055]  All right, that guy is fighting for America on so many fronts.
[01:21:16.115 --> 01:21:16.796]  It's just insane.
[01:21:16.816 --> 01:21:20.018]  He's like the inner Geiser Bunny, and he gets a lot of victories, too.
[01:21:21.059 --> 01:21:23.861]  And yeah, it's just been unbelievable behind the scenes.
[01:21:23.941 --> 01:21:26.703]  We've freaked him out pretty bad with all the depositions we've been doing.
[01:21:27.223 --> 01:21:30.806]  And so now the judge just says, sorry, you don't get a jury trial.
[01:21:32.065 --> 01:21:33.506]  Wow, that's really nice.
[01:21:33.586 --> 01:21:34.467]  Oh, we didn't give you anything.
[01:21:34.627 --> 01:21:35.968]  Just hundreds of thousands of documents.
[01:21:36.568 --> 01:21:37.729]  Jones gave us nothing.
[01:21:37.809 --> 01:21:38.910]  He defaulted.
[01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:42.632]  I mean, it's just, it's just where all this is, folks.
[01:21:43.173 --> 01:21:47.396]  Listen, InfoWars isn't going to be shut down like these people openly say they want.
[01:21:47.456 --> 01:21:52.960]  It's going to expand because I know you have will and I know you understand how important this broadcast is that you built.
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:54.281]  So I'm going to tell you now.
[01:21:55.489 --> 01:21:56.169]  Now's the time.
[01:21:56.269 --> 01:21:57.470]  You built this operation.
[01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:58.410]  You supported it.
[01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:59.050]  You are it.
[01:21:59.931 --> 01:22:09.274]  And so I need major funds, ladies and gentlemen, not to declare bankruptcy and not to, you know, bow to these people, but to expand what we're doing.
[01:22:09.574 --> 01:22:10.314]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:22:10.934 --> 01:22:16.356]  Support us now and you will see even more action and even more pushback against the new order.
[01:22:16.556 --> 01:22:17.357]  You've got my commitment.
[01:22:18.749 --> 01:22:20.090]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:21.891]  It's back in and I misunderstood.
[01:22:21.931 --> 01:22:23.012]  They got a limited shipment.
[01:22:23.092 --> 01:22:28.816]  Another shipment's coming in, supposedly in a few weeks, of what has become our new bestseller, BrainForce Ultra.
[01:22:28.876 --> 01:22:29.997]  The reviews are incredible.
[01:22:30.877 --> 01:22:35.280]  It's 50% off right now, but I'm going to go ahead and just end that sale tomorrow because it's going to be sold out anyway.
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.621]  So I need to fund our operation.
[01:22:36.961 --> 01:22:37.982]  So we want to get 30% off.
[01:22:38.002 --> 01:22:38.522]  Now's the time.
[01:22:38.602 --> 01:22:46.868]  And then down and out is all these known herbal for thousands of years concentrates and then now new developed systems that are in it.
[01:22:46.888 --> 01:22:47.908]  I'm not going to read the whole thing to you.
[01:22:47.928 --> 01:22:48.609]  Hell, I might as well here.
[01:22:49.810 --> 01:22:51.170]  Let me just grab this because it's so important.
[01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:56.413]  I want you to hear all the things that are in this product.
[01:22:57.394 --> 01:22:59.495]  Guarana Seed Alpha-C-GPC.
[01:23:02.659 --> 01:23:09.001]  Green coffee bean, alethro root, yerba mate leaf, green tea leaf, ginkgo leaf, ashwagandha root, and more.
[01:23:09.241 --> 01:23:11.322]  And it's concentrated, it's strong.
[01:23:12.082 --> 01:23:19.305]  I can tell you right now that Brain Force Ultra is just incredible for clean, focused, amazing, no crash energy.
[01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:21.426]  It's the opposite of those poison energy drinks.
[01:23:21.886 --> 01:23:24.467]  It's selling out, because again, we've got a limited supply in.
[01:23:25.347 --> 01:23:27.548]  We got in a limited supply of Down and Out.
[01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:29.828]  It is the all-natural sleep aid.
[01:23:29.908 --> 01:23:38.791]  It's got a whole bunch of known ingredients in it as well that are good for helping you sleep, which is so good for your immune system.
[01:23:38.891 --> 01:23:41.312]  Deep, restful, clean, healthy sleep.
[01:23:41.372 --> 01:23:43.713]  Not from drinking NyQuil with alcohol in it and chemicals.
[01:23:44.093 --> 01:23:47.214]  Not from some poison sleeping pill that kills your REM sleep.
[01:23:47.274 --> 01:23:48.334]  No, no, this does the opposite.
[01:23:48.594 --> 01:23:53.676]  German Chamomile, Lemon Balm, Valerian Root Extract, Passionflower, Melatonin and more.
[01:23:54.176 --> 01:23:57.779]  And it is strong, so I'd take a quarter dose for the first time.
[01:23:57.799 --> 01:24:00.061]  And this was sold out for like five, six months.
[01:24:00.522 --> 01:24:02.904]  I ran out of it, and I got it back a few weeks ago.
[01:24:03.324 --> 01:24:07.548]  We got an advance shipment of it, and I've been sleeping so much better when I take it.
[01:24:07.568 --> 01:24:13.213]  I forgot to take it when I went to Dallas Wednesday night to be on Steven Crowder and other shows, and I didn't sleep very well.
[01:24:13.373 --> 01:24:22.910]   So yeah, there is the issue of My brain is so active that I don't sleep well if I drink caffeine too late, and then especially if I don't take my down and out.
[01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:25.251]  And I'm not knocking knockout.
[01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:28.973]  It's eight ingredients, some of the same, some different, just not as strong.
[01:24:29.653 --> 01:24:31.154]  And that's great for a lot of people.
[01:24:31.174 --> 01:24:32.574]  When you first take knockout, it works really well.
[01:24:34.676 --> 01:24:37.117]  Do the same thing, but naturally, that drugs do.
[01:24:37.137 --> 01:24:38.298]  And you know about receptors.
[01:24:38.758 --> 01:24:40.238]  The drugs you take for a while stop working.
[01:24:40.699 --> 01:24:41.879]  This is God's drugs.
[01:24:41.939 --> 01:24:44.460]  God's natural way of doing all this.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.721]  And it's just incredible.
[01:24:46.141 --> 01:24:48.182]  So, need that incredible energy?
[01:24:48.482 --> 01:24:49.843]  RainForce Ultra.
[01:24:50.443 --> 01:24:52.144]  Need to relax and chill out.
[01:24:52.744 --> 01:24:53.824]  Takes about 30 minutes to hit.
[01:24:54.265 --> 01:24:55.845]  We have Down and Out back in stock.
[01:24:56.426 --> 01:24:57.306]  50% off.
[01:24:57.346 --> 01:25:02.668]  And I'm gonna keep Down and Out off at 50% for at least a week, because we got a good shipment of it.
[01:25:04.469 --> 01:25:08.330]  Again, we did not get a good shipment of Brain Force Ultra, and they say more is coming.
[01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:15.453]  Believe me, I can fund this operation and kick butt and do all the stuff I want to do if we just get the funding in here, and so much of that is supply chains.
[01:25:15.473 --> 01:25:16.213]  That's not your fault.
[01:25:16.433 --> 01:25:19.794]  That's Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and their whole Great Reset trying to destroy us all.
[01:25:20.154 --> 01:25:31.938]  Oh, and I talked to Blake that runs the warehouse and stuff, and he said, Alex, don't end the t-shirt sale because we're selling five times more t-shirts we've ever sold, and you said you want them out there to get the word out.
[01:25:33.072 --> 01:25:35.173]  We're just gonna sell out of everything so that we can reorder.
[01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:35.833]  This is great.
[01:25:35.853 --> 01:25:37.454]  We had hundreds of different shirts.
[01:25:37.834 --> 01:25:39.014]  Some sell good, some don't.
[01:25:39.054 --> 01:25:39.875]  They're all blown out.
[01:25:40.215 --> 01:25:42.776]  Keep it up for at least four or five more days.
[01:25:43.336 --> 01:25:48.518]  So, all the t-shirts, ball caps, designer ones, regular ones, made in America, not made in America.
[01:25:48.538 --> 01:25:49.019]  It's all there.
[01:25:49.299 --> 01:25:50.099]  Over a hundred designs.
[01:25:50.539 --> 01:25:54.281]  Some limited edition at InfoWarsTore.com at cost.

[01:26:11.051 --> 01:26:11.631]  All right, folks.
[01:26:11.671 --> 01:26:16.133]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide, and I've got a lot to hit, and I want to have some fun, too.
[01:26:16.153 --> 01:26:22.435]  We'll play a clip from Steven Crowder coming up, and then we've got just a bunch of other news I'm going to hit here.
[01:26:22.455 --> 01:26:26.016]  Geopolitical news, police state news, attempts to take us off the air news.
[01:26:26.076 --> 01:26:26.777]  It's all coming up.
[01:26:26.817 --> 01:26:29.821]   But first, Let's go ahead and dig into this.
[01:26:29.861 --> 01:26:31.882]  I got to a lot of these, but let's get to some more of these clips.
[01:26:32.643 --> 01:26:39.668]  We already played representatives from Congress saying Margaret Sanger is good and basically is an anti-racist.
[01:26:39.688 --> 01:26:44.332]  That's like saying Hitler loves Jews or the KKK loves black people.
[01:26:45.253 --> 01:26:48.155]  Here's Dr. Gazella Mosaddi.
[01:26:48.735 --> 01:26:49.976]  Abortion is a blessing.
[01:26:50.016 --> 01:26:50.817]  Let's play that clip.
[01:26:51.277 --> 01:26:52.558]  Abortion is a blessing.
[01:26:52.618 --> 01:26:53.779]  It's an act of love.
[01:26:54.279 --> 01:26:54.680]  Here it is.
[01:26:55.549 --> 01:27:12.768]  SV-8 has not only caused a near total abortion ban in Texas, it has made it extremely dangerous to be pregnant in Texas, where our maternal morbidity and mortality rate is already unconscionably high, especially for black women and pregnant people of color.
[01:27:13.689 --> 01:27:15.652]  Texas deserves better.
[01:27:16.827 --> 01:27:19.210]  I know first hand that abortion saves lives.
[01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:23.695]  For the thousands of people I've cared for, abortion is a blessing.
[01:27:23.995 --> 01:27:25.337]  Abortion is an act of love.
[01:27:25.697 --> 01:27:26.638]  Abortion is freedom.
[01:27:27.339 --> 01:27:28.840]  We need federal protection now.
[01:27:29.321 --> 01:27:34.987]  We need laws that elevate science and evidence and recognize the dignity and autonomy of people accessing care.
[01:27:37.517 --> 01:27:38.458]  Alright, here's the next one.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:41.764]  This is Representative Jackie Speller.
[01:27:42.004 --> 01:27:44.468]  Abortion is safer than childbirth.
[01:27:44.488 --> 01:27:45.990]  Well, it's not safe for the baby.
[01:27:46.131 --> 01:27:46.471]  Here it is.
[01:27:48.704 --> 01:27:53.708]  2018 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
[01:27:54.369 --> 01:28:02.915]  Abortion is safer than childbirth, colonoscopies, dental procedures, plastic surgery, and tonsillectomies.
[01:28:03.676 --> 01:28:09.020]  And yet, facilities that provide... That's because Planned Parenthood does 90% of them and doesn't report it back.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.181]  Because they're a criminal organization.
[01:28:11.201 --> 01:28:11.742]  Let's continue.
[01:28:12.734 --> 01:28:25.065]  And yet, facilities that provide abortion care are more likely to be subjected to medically unnecessary, politically motivated regulations that only make it more difficult to provide abortion services.
[01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:33.053]  Have you encountered such targeted regulations of abortion providers where you practice, and if so, how has it affected you?
[01:28:34.162 --> 01:28:42.286]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, they also don't tell you there's a bunch of studies out where you're double, some studies say triple, they all say it increases when a woman has abortions.
[01:28:42.866 --> 01:28:44.067]  We're not judging women that have done it.
[01:28:44.107 --> 01:28:45.908]  We understand you get roped into it, it happens.
[01:28:46.028 --> 01:28:46.828]  I've been involved in it.
[01:28:47.148 --> 01:28:47.729]  I've repented.
[01:28:48.449 --> 01:28:51.810]  If you weren't consciously doing it as a Satanist like they do, God forgives you.
[01:28:52.711 --> 01:28:55.332]  Like, I admit I paid for abortions back when I was younger and I repented of it.
[01:28:56.073 --> 01:28:58.634]  And the media goes, look, he admits he's a hypocrite.
[01:28:58.694 --> 01:29:00.094]  No, I changed my mind.
[01:29:00.154 --> 01:29:01.195]  I decided I was wrong.
[01:29:02.115 --> 01:29:02.996]  And God touched my heart.
[01:29:04.252 --> 01:29:08.975]  And I was, I finally got, you know, didn't get religion in some church or on TV.
[01:29:09.035 --> 01:29:11.217]  I just, God touched my heart to really be a good person.
[01:29:12.438 --> 01:29:15.340]  Uh, and, and, and then for years I didn't even, you know, date or anything.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.421]  And I was about.
[01:29:19.206 --> 01:29:20.607]  19 to 21 or so.
[01:29:21.207 --> 01:29:23.789]  I hung up my spurs because I just knew that was a serious thing.
[01:29:24.189 --> 01:29:28.011]  I said, next time, you know, if I start going out with women again, if I get pregnant, I'm going to get married and have a child.
[01:29:28.572 --> 01:29:32.394]  That's not the perfect moral position, but that's what I did, and that's where Rex Jones comes from.
[01:29:33.115 --> 01:29:33.875]  And I'm glad I had him.
[01:29:33.915 --> 01:29:34.956]  I'm glad I didn't chop him up.
[01:29:35.997 --> 01:29:42.421]  But when you have abortions, it massively increases uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancer.
[01:29:42.441 --> 01:29:42.821]  Look it up.
[01:29:43.582 --> 01:29:44.542]  So they don't want you to know that.
[01:29:44.582 --> 01:29:47.004]  They're a lying pack of globalists.
[01:29:48.359 --> 01:29:50.940]  And again, you can say there's too many people, and yeah, there's poor people.
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:52.461]  Should we just start killing everybody?
[01:29:53.241 --> 01:29:56.123]  And the globalists are a bunch of weird skeksis, a bunch of demons.
[01:29:56.803 --> 01:29:58.804]  If anybody needs to go, they love all this killing.
[01:29:58.924 --> 01:30:06.028]  I suggest, you know, they get in their closet, hang a rope over the deal, and get up on a stool and just hop off that sucker.
[01:30:06.728 --> 01:30:07.348]  Too many people?
[01:30:07.528 --> 01:30:08.349]  Get to work!
[01:30:10.009 --> 01:30:13.531]  Go to the store, get a gun, shove it in your mouth, back of your head, and pull the damn trigger.
[01:30:13.551 --> 01:30:14.012]  Let's go!
[01:30:14.032 --> 01:30:15.433]  I hope you don't kill yourselves.
[01:30:15.473 --> 01:30:18.555]  I'm just saying, if you love death so much, show us how it's done!
[01:30:19.996 --> 01:30:24.079]  Take your miserable, leftist self and go to a building.
[01:30:24.119 --> 01:30:26.200]  Jump off the top and make sure nobody's down below.
[01:30:26.801 --> 01:30:28.962]  Stop killing our babies before they get to make a choice.
[01:30:29.243 --> 01:30:30.423]  Stop stealing their free will.
[01:30:31.484 --> 01:30:32.525]  Infowars.com.
[01:30:32.545 --> 01:30:33.465]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:30:33.485 --> 01:30:33.846]  Stay with us.
[01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:36.886]  We got some really big COVID news.
[01:30:36.946 --> 01:30:39.066]  I'm going to hit next segment that's just broken.
[01:30:39.086 --> 01:30:44.548]  Then we got Dr. Zelenko joining us coming up, and I'm probably even open the phones up in the last half of this interview.
[01:30:44.588 --> 01:30:48.009]  He'll be with us for an hour and a half here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:48.029 --> 01:30:49.070]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:30:49.090 --> 01:31:11.136]   But let me play something from Steven Crowder's program he does two hours a day, Monday through Thursday, and watching the professionalism, watching his small crew, Do 95% of the show live is incredible, but I got to be in one of the parts that is produced.
[01:31:11.176 --> 01:31:13.458]  So they asked me to be there at 7 30 in the morning.
[01:31:13.478 --> 01:31:13.999]  We get there.
[01:31:14.559 --> 01:31:16.641]  I go into a couple of takes, shoot my little piece.
[01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:18.523]  They go in, shoot their piece.
[01:31:19.443 --> 01:31:23.927]  And by the time the show starts at nine, they've got the piece ready.
[01:31:24.027 --> 01:31:25.008]  And by nine 20, it airs.
[01:31:26.926 --> 01:31:28.848]  And that was like two people working on that.
[01:31:28.868 --> 01:31:30.569]  And then they go and they host on the show.
[01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:38.736]  So just, I mean, Steven Crowder, I was on a show in studio a year ago or so, and it was, it was good, but he's getting better.
[01:31:38.756 --> 01:31:39.777]  It was already amazing.
[01:31:39.797 --> 01:31:41.999]  This was like, and I'm not kissing Crowder's ass.
[01:31:42.159 --> 01:31:42.860]  I am impressed.
[01:31:43.941 --> 01:31:48.404]  I'm impressed how young Jamie on Joe Rogan's show runs the whole thing by himself.
[01:31:48.925 --> 01:31:49.325]  Whole thing.
[01:31:49.766 --> 01:31:52.067]  They got a guy, you know, get coffee or whatever, let people in the door.
[01:31:52.981 --> 01:31:57.544]  A couple of veterans as guardians, but that's what's going on around Joe.
[01:31:57.584 --> 01:31:59.065]  But I mean, Joe does a great job.
[01:31:59.386 --> 01:32:00.266]  This was amazing.
[01:32:01.127 --> 01:32:05.970]  And, you know, there's one way to fight that's really serious and other ways with humor.
[01:32:06.391 --> 01:32:17.538]  But all over the country in leprous controlled areas and also the UK, they're letting biological men demand pap smears, demand cervical examinations that don't exist.
[01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:27.136]   That'd be like, you know, pulling up in your Ford F-150 car that's an eight-cylinder and saying, I want you to work on my airplane that has a jet engine.
[01:32:27.156 --> 01:32:34.239]  They go, that's not an airplane, that's an F-150, eight-cylinder gasoline engine, made in Dearborn, Michigan.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:37.121]  They're like, no, that's a F-16 fighter jet.
[01:32:38.404 --> 01:32:43.107]  And you're supposed to go, well, let's go and work on those wheels and the engine and get in the cockpit.
[01:32:43.147 --> 01:32:43.687]  Woo-wee!
[01:32:43.727 --> 01:32:44.508]  We're flying around.
[01:32:45.068 --> 01:32:48.690]  But they have laws passed in the UK and here that they'll arrest your ass.
[01:32:48.710 --> 01:33:02.079]  And they're actually starting to do it if you say, hey, dude, you're like a six-foot-four dude from prison beating people up and breaking things in a convenience store because someone called you, hey, man, come on up.
[01:33:03.139 --> 01:33:05.521]  It's not man, it's ma'am!
[01:33:06.837 --> 01:33:16.620]  This is all the mental illness, where if you'll accept this from the Stockholm Syndrome program that they run, of the Tavistock Institute, that's where all this came from, you'll accept anything.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.640]  Well, I don't accept it.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:22.541]  Not because I hate people that want to be a different sex, or I hate... No!
[01:33:23.041 --> 01:33:23.301]  No!
[01:33:23.882 --> 01:33:29.763]  I'm saying it's the cult of giving up who we are to become something else, then the system manages that transhumanism.
[01:33:30.083 --> 01:33:32.464]  That's what I'm saying the extreme end of it is.
[01:33:34.076 --> 01:33:37.079]  So here's their build-up of what's happening.
[01:33:37.119 --> 01:33:37.860]  It actually went longer.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.122]  This one I'll only play part of it.
[01:33:39.522 --> 01:33:45.689]  Describing all the insanity in the prisons where two women have a baby and they give them condoms now.
[01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:48.312]  Because you know women have male members.
[01:33:48.352 --> 01:33:48.732]  Here it is.
[01:33:53.263 --> 01:33:54.244]  Are we ready though?
[01:33:54.884 --> 01:33:56.106]  I don't know that I'm ever ready.
[01:33:56.366 --> 01:33:57.507]  I don't know that we want to be ready.
[01:33:57.527 --> 01:34:11.079]  But the Women's Liberation Front, I already hate this, it's the worst, reported at least one woman at the Central California Women's Facility was pregnant after a male, transgender male prisoner was transferred there.
[01:34:11.839 --> 01:34:21.188]   Keep in mind, the male prisoner was permitted to transfer under the new California law SB 132, which allows biological males We're not supposed to use the term biological males now.
[01:34:21.208 --> 01:34:22.208]  What's the term we're supposed to use?
[01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:23.369]  Uh, person with penis or something?
[01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.570]  Person?
[01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:23.930]  Yes.
[01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:25.792]  No, it's something else, mate.
[01:34:25.852 --> 01:34:26.893]  Lady McBulls?
[01:34:27.113 --> 01:34:27.413]  Yes.
[01:34:29.114 --> 01:34:29.955]  Seating person?
[01:34:29.975 --> 01:34:30.636]  Yeah.
[01:34:30.716 --> 01:34:33.718]  Seating per... Is that what a seating person... I don't know.
[01:34:33.758 --> 01:34:34.359]  I just made that up.
[01:34:34.499 --> 01:34:36.221]  I heard, but I had read at Vox...
[01:34:37.083 --> 01:34:40.083]   that it's hateful to say biological males. So I don't know, they're a different term.
[01:34:40.083 --> 01:34:44.083]   Like Latinx, go say that to the Latin King, see how it turns out.
[01:34:44.083 --> 01:34:45.083]  Let us know what the term is.
[01:34:45.083 --> 01:34:47.083]  Sooner or later someone's getting nine teardrop tattoos.
[01:34:47.083 --> 01:34:49.083]  They just look like Pierrots.
[01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:51.083]  I used to call them dad.
[01:34:51.083 --> 01:34:58.083]   So under SB 132 it allows biological males to use women's locker rooms, homeless shelters, and prisons.
[01:34:58.083 --> 01:34:59.083]  That's a good thing.
[01:34:59.083 --> 01:35:02.083]   To the point that now condoms have been issued within the prison.
[01:35:02.354 --> 01:35:03.454]  What?
[01:35:03.714 --> 01:35:10.557]  Yeah, this is part of the protocol to ensure that sex between inmates, which is illegal, by the way, would be safe.
[01:35:10.577 --> 01:35:13.999]  So they need to make sure that it's safe sex in an all-females prison.
[01:35:14.099 --> 01:35:14.379]  Wow.
[01:35:14.599 --> 01:35:19.902]  Where they cannot get pregnant, and so... All women.
[01:35:20.122 --> 01:35:22.023]  Condoms.
[01:35:23.023 --> 01:35:23.544]  Pregnancy.
[01:35:24.844 --> 01:35:26.844]  Immaculate conception?
[01:35:26.844 --> 01:35:32.844]  [Music]
[01:35:32.844 --> 01:35:38.844]   Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,
[01:35:38.844 --> 01:35:43.844]   which will be to all people, for there is born to you a baby in this cell.
[01:35:44.056 --> 01:35:47.577]  And this shall be a sign unto you of... A virgin birth?
[01:35:47.877 --> 01:35:48.437]  A miracle?
[01:35:49.497 --> 01:35:49.757]  No.
[01:35:50.317 --> 01:35:52.217]  Your cellmate, that guy dressed as a woman?
[01:35:55.378 --> 01:35:56.518]  He's going to rape you.
[01:35:57.698 --> 01:35:59.099]  I'm a girl.
[01:36:00.559 --> 01:36:01.299]  Repeatedly.
[01:36:05.154 --> 01:36:06.395]  That read rough on the paper.
[01:36:06.495 --> 01:36:07.977]  It really did, yes.
[01:36:08.057 --> 01:36:09.438]  And who could have seen this coming?
[01:36:09.679 --> 01:36:13.443]  Good old Alex Jones as the archangel to soften the blow.
[01:36:13.963 --> 01:36:14.644]  He did a great job.
[01:36:14.744 --> 01:36:15.785]  I don't apologize for it.
[01:36:15.925 --> 01:36:19.969]  I see a whole Con Air remake where prisoners just try to get swapped over to the women's prison.
[01:36:19.989 --> 01:36:21.431]  We're not trying to get free!
[01:36:21.451 --> 01:36:22.812]  Is Alex Jones in that remake?
[01:36:22.872 --> 01:36:23.373]  I want to watch it.
[01:36:23.393 --> 01:36:26.196]  I would absolutely go to a woman's jail instead.
[01:36:26.676 --> 01:36:30.459]  They'll recast Nicolas Cage as the new Nicolas Cage with the hair transplant.
[01:36:30.539 --> 01:36:30.719]  Right.
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:31.500]  Ah, yeah.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.020]  The drunk one?
[01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:32.401]  Yeah.
[01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:33.442]  I'm still crazy.
[01:36:33.542 --> 01:36:33.702]  Yeah.
[01:36:34.643 --> 01:36:37.965]  I'm still on the plane, but I have more hair!
[01:36:37.985 --> 01:36:41.968]  Alright, there's Stephen Crowder.
[01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:45.311]  That was all done live, except for the little minute-long piece.
[01:36:46.212 --> 01:36:47.613]  And it just goes on and on from there.
[01:36:47.993 --> 01:36:48.514]  Just amazing.
[01:36:50.126 --> 01:36:55.249]  Okay, let me hit this news now and then I'll get into, because we got to have some more fun on the show in the midst of all this.
[01:36:56.230 --> 01:37:02.774]  Sink Uyghur, Sink Ogre of the Young Turds has come out and attacked Joe Rogan and said he'll beat him up.
[01:37:04.718 --> 01:37:16.393]  Just out of the blue, I'll beat you up, obviously, because Joe's 10 times, 20 times, 30 times bigger than Sink, conservatively, the force-fed, George Soros-funded, Google force-fed minion.
[01:37:17.274 --> 01:37:21.079]  That's next segment, where a Sink says he'll beat up Joe Rogan.
[01:37:22.025 --> 01:37:22.905]  He's gonna beat him up.
[01:37:23.045 --> 01:37:25.146]  I've actually seen Joe beat people up.
[01:37:25.586 --> 01:37:33.888]  He was not as friendly as he is now at 50-something years old back when I knew him when he was in his 20s and late 20s and I was in my early 20s.
[01:37:34.468 --> 01:37:38.169]  So I've actually seen big guys mess with Joe a few times and it didn't go too well.
[01:37:38.929 --> 01:37:41.590]  He just chokes him out, just jumps on top of him like a monkey.
[01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:42.250]  He's like a gorilla.
[01:37:43.223 --> 01:37:46.725]  And, you know, he kicks harder than, like, some of the biggest guys in the UFC.
[01:37:46.765 --> 01:37:47.586]  They've got a contest.
[01:37:48.206 --> 01:37:50.808]  So, just getting kicked by him is like getting kicked by a mule.
[01:37:51.788 --> 01:37:54.770]  And so, again, it's so ridiculous.
[01:37:54.810 --> 01:37:55.370]  It's a stunt.
[01:37:56.511 --> 01:37:58.652]  And it just shows the left is all about hoaxes.
[01:37:59.152 --> 01:38:00.713]  You know, men can have babies.
[01:38:01.074 --> 01:38:03.175]  It's a gift to the baby to kill it.
[01:38:03.215 --> 01:38:04.776]  It's good for them to not have a future.
[01:38:05.116 --> 01:38:06.137]  They were so worthless.
[01:38:06.917 --> 01:38:11.700]  Ivermectin's bad, but now Pfizer's coming out with a pill that has the same ingredients in it.
[01:38:14.804 --> 01:38:18.705]  They're just bombing us with propaganda, but all over the world, people are fighting back.
[01:38:19.105 --> 01:38:27.848]  In Southern Australia, New South Wales has the worst UN programs, the carbon tax, the medical IDs, and the police chief in one big city finally said, we're not enforcing this anymore.
[01:38:28.188 --> 01:38:29.509]  The public's gonna basically kill us.
[01:38:30.289 --> 01:38:37.391]  Well, now Australia's New South Wales state premier, that's their governor, resigns over corruption probe amid COVID-19 battle.
[01:38:38.511 --> 01:38:42.953]  Premier of Australia's biggest state has been announcing new world order and endless lockdowns.
[01:38:45.165 --> 01:39:11.926]   The premier of Australia's biggest state economy, New South Wales, Gladys Birkin-Jinklin, sounds like something out of a weird Santa Claus' wife name, resigned on Friday after a corruption watchdog said it was investigating whether she was involved in a conduct that is constituted Are involved a breach, or consisted, or involved a breach of public trust.
[01:39:11.966 --> 01:39:13.508]  Reading her word name, I suddenly couldn't read.
[01:39:13.908 --> 01:39:17.852]  Constituted, or involved a breach of public trust.
[01:39:18.806 --> 01:39:30.650]  And it says, Birkin Jicklin's shock resignation comes as the state, which has an economy larger than Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia, battles the biggest COVID-19 outbreak.
[01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:37.512]  You mean the total lockdown, like 20 people have died in the last year, and it's total hysteria, and fake testing, and lockups, and permanent FEMA camps being built?
[01:39:38.817 --> 01:39:50.272]  Berkin Jicklin said that the issues being investigated were historical matters, but she felt compelled to resign because of the long time frames likely involved in the investigation.
[01:39:50.813 --> 01:39:51.654]  And who knows what it is?
[01:39:52.235 --> 01:39:52.756]  All I know is...
[01:39:53.917 --> 01:40:00.663]  Most of these people have been put in power because they're blackmailed with stuff, and it's usually not bad enough to be drug dealing or money laundering or even murder.
[01:40:01.483 --> 01:40:09.090]  Usually, they have been involved with or have covered up what the German government officially ran, giant pedophile rings with raped children.
[01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:10.511]  Remember, that's mainstream news now.
[01:40:11.432 --> 01:40:13.453]  30,000 in one city alone given to be raped.
[01:40:13.634 --> 01:40:16.836]  That's right, globalist love is like a guillotine.
[01:40:18.057 --> 01:40:19.278]  It's like a ventilator.
[01:40:19.318 --> 01:40:20.980]  When you got COVID, it's going to kill you.
[01:40:22.332 --> 01:40:28.999]  But don't worry, Pfizer's coming out with this new pill that cures COVID, and it's got the same ingredients as ivermectin in it.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.162]  They just slightly changed both molecules.
[01:40:31.202 --> 01:40:32.843]  Got the articles right here.
[01:40:33.044 --> 01:40:33.384]  Wow.
[01:40:33.404 --> 01:40:35.867]  I remember saying a few weeks ago when they had a new pill coming out, they wouldn't say what it was.
[01:40:35.907 --> 01:40:37.368]  I go, I bet it's ivermectin.
[01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:39.591]  Sure as hell is!
[01:40:42.944 --> 01:40:52.346]  You imagine taking money like these TV people and these talk show hosts, even low-level ones that have like maybe 10,000 subscribers, you'd pay thousands of dollars to come out and say, I took the shot, I love it, it's safe, it's great.
[01:40:53.026 --> 01:40:58.028]  I'll bet my bottom dollar, I don't know this, but that the Young Turds, Howard Stern, all of them took money.
[01:40:58.828 --> 01:41:00.588]  But what I do know is Cenk is full of crap.
[01:41:00.668 --> 01:41:01.249]  I've seen him.
[01:41:02.649 --> 01:41:05.730]  I mean, if I was an out-of-shape fat ass, he's way worse than I am.
[01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:08.750]  And again, they said, hey, later you want to come on our show?
[01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:09.591]  I've been on their show before.
[01:41:09.911 --> 01:41:10.691]  I see him at the RNC.
[01:41:13.048 --> 01:41:20.612]  2016.
[01:41:13.148 --> 01:41:20.612]  I go to a bunch of other interviews with hundreds of shows going, it was a smorgasbord, and I come back by and they go to break and I go, hey Sink, how you doing?
[01:41:20.632 --> 01:41:26.474]  And then as he sees Roger Stone, he goes, oh he's broken in our studio!
[01:41:26.854 --> 01:41:28.895]  It's an open convention center.
[01:41:29.475 --> 01:41:31.656]  Roger goes, screw you, I'm not going on your show.
[01:41:32.557 --> 01:41:33.377]  And he blows up at him.
[01:41:34.678 --> 01:41:35.098]  Sink did.
[01:41:35.118 --> 01:41:37.079]  So the reason I'm going after Sink is, he's put out a tweet.
[01:41:38.001 --> 01:41:41.985]  Just saying that he will beat up Joe Rogan, that he knows how to defeat him.
[01:41:42.005 --> 01:41:48.812]  He says, he says, if Joe Rogan tries to assault me, whatever, that's incredibly dumb, but also wouldn't work.
[01:41:49.172 --> 01:41:50.914]  I'm much larger than Joe.
[01:41:50.994 --> 01:41:51.654]  Yeah, fatter.
[01:41:52.095 --> 01:41:56.459]  I've fought my whole life, not against championship martial arts people.
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:57.840]  I'd end him.
[01:41:58.521 --> 01:42:00.163]  But grownups don't do that.
[01:42:01.721 --> 01:42:05.323]  He says that to a person that said, I'll bet you a thousand dollars you won't talk crap to Joe's face.
[01:42:05.343 --> 01:42:08.665]  He's calling Joe a liar and a punk and a bad guy.
[01:42:09.065 --> 01:42:10.586]  He's talking about Ivermectin and stuff.
[01:42:10.626 --> 01:42:12.727]  So again, I've known Joe since I was 20.
[01:42:15.438 --> 01:42:16.199]  Four years old.
[01:42:16.499 --> 01:42:16.739]  Yeah, 24, 25.
[01:42:17.019 --> 01:42:21.443]  And I mean, back then, I mean, I was like, I've seen Joe beat people up several times.
[01:42:21.543 --> 01:42:21.923]  Big guys.
[01:42:22.124 --> 01:42:23.325]  Hey, punk, you think you're tough?
[01:42:23.345 --> 01:42:26.707]  And he just, like, jumps on them and chokes them out or grabs them and throws them to the ground.
[01:42:26.727 --> 01:42:28.949]  I mean, like, probably like six foot four or five guys.
[01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:32.592]  And we could show all the footage of Joe doing kicks that even the top people can't do.
[01:42:32.632 --> 01:42:33.893]  Now, his back's out, his bones.
[01:42:34.954 --> 01:42:36.235]  People said, oh, could you beat up Logan Paul?
[01:42:36.255 --> 01:42:36.635]  He said, no.
[01:42:36.936 --> 01:42:37.836]  Logan Paul kicked my ass.
[01:42:37.876 --> 01:42:39.198]  He's young, he's big, he's a heavyweight.
[01:42:39.718 --> 01:42:41.740]  But I don't know, Joe would probably, with Jiu Jitsu, beat him.
[01:42:41.981 --> 01:42:44.323]  I mean, Joe's a legitimate badass, and I'm not kissing his ass.
[01:42:44.684 --> 01:42:45.364]  I mean, I know Joe.
[01:42:45.404 --> 01:42:46.085]  I've seen him do it.
[01:42:46.986 --> 01:42:47.907]  I mean, I'm a good brawler.
[01:42:47.947 --> 01:42:48.908]  I can fight if I need to.
[01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:51.111]  He, with technique, would just choke me out quickly.
[01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:53.173]  I mean, he's like a gorilla, okay?
[01:42:53.854 --> 01:42:58.459]  And to have Cink running around saying all this is insane.
[01:43:00.322 --> 01:43:04.136]   Now, Let's go ahead here and go to this clip.
[01:43:04.176 --> 01:43:10.620]  This is Saint talking about how, because the Democrats have now been fact-checking, and they're going around defending the bestiality.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:24.310]  There's an article with leftist fact-checkers defending the Muslims being brought in from the Middle East that are into bestiality and have child porn and bestiality on their phones, and they're fact-checking that it's not a cow, it's a horse they're having sex with, so it's okay.
[01:43:25.170 --> 01:43:27.712]  And Cenk has now been out, you know, I guess defending those migrants.
[01:43:27.752 --> 01:43:33.555]  So, let's remember that if he was a dictator, he thinks about legalizing bestiality and pleasuring animals.
[01:43:33.595 --> 01:43:33.975]  Here it is.
[01:43:34.796 --> 01:43:37.717]  I have decided what that boing-boing chick was doing.
[01:43:37.737 --> 01:43:40.439]  She was doing a jaywalking of bestiality.
[01:43:41.219 --> 01:43:45.862]  Like, yeah, it might technically be a crime, but let's not waste the court's time on jaywalking.
[01:43:46.382 --> 01:43:46.663]  Okay.
[01:43:46.863 --> 01:43:47.383]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:43:47.403 --> 01:43:48.123]  Yeah, yeah, fair enough.
[01:43:48.304 --> 01:43:50.445]  But here comes the controversial part, the part I shouldn't say.
[01:43:52.225 --> 01:44:06.880]  I believe that I am going, if I were the benevolent dictator of the world, I would legalize bestiality where you are giving, where you are pleasuring the animal.
[01:44:07.861 --> 01:44:08.502]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:10.090]  Okay.
[01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:11.971]  Okay.
[01:44:12.091 --> 01:44:12.631]  Now, why?
[01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:13.471]  Why did that happen?
[01:44:13.891 --> 01:44:14.711]  Yeah, why is that wrong?
[01:44:14.751 --> 01:44:16.912]  It really is a delicacy, you said.
[01:44:16.952 --> 01:44:17.872]  No, no, I'll tell you why.
[01:44:17.912 --> 01:44:18.452]  I'll tell you why.
[01:44:18.773 --> 01:44:26.575]  Because, like, so there's, like, was the case that we covered where there was, like, a guy or a girl or something that was pleasuring a horse, and the horse came to a conclusion, right?
[01:44:27.532 --> 01:44:28.413]  So, who got harmed?
[01:44:28.673 --> 01:44:30.254]  You know that people who are... That's enough.
[01:44:30.074 --> 01:44:36.274]   So same thing he says about pedophiles or Nambla says they say not him Nambla says it's okay to do it
[01:44:36.274 --> 01:44:40.833]   You know just so long as the child enjoys it as long as it's love
[01:44:40.833 --> 01:44:48.894]   Oh Oh, damn you got straight
[01:44:48.859 --> 01:44:49.679]  Here he is with George St.
[01:44:49.699 --> 01:44:49.980]  Pierre.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:50.740]  Greatest to ever do it.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:51.740]  Teaching him!
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:56.782]  Because Joe Rogan does have some techniques, which is very, very good.
[01:45:00.584 --> 01:45:01.904]  That's Joe Schilling, I believe.
[01:45:02.224 --> 01:45:03.965]  A really world-class kickboxer.
[01:45:04.805 --> 01:45:05.425]  I can do that.
[01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:05.886]  Yes!
[01:45:07.106 --> 01:45:11.548]  Let's go ahead and go to Sink coming after me and flipping out at the RNC.
[01:45:13.618 --> 01:45:16.700]  I'm not going to debate this guy.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.262]  You're a hatchet man.
[01:45:19.322 --> 01:45:28.368]  I don't know what anyone in the media takes you seriously.
[01:45:28.728 --> 01:45:30.069]  All you do is lie.
[01:45:30.209 --> 01:45:35.232]  You're known as the biggest liar in media.
[01:45:35.132 --> 01:45:37.612]  You're known as the biggest liar in media!
[01:45:37.612 --> 01:45:39.612]  You're the biggest liar in media!
[01:45:39.612 --> 01:45:40.612]  I'm the liar, loser!
[01:45:40.612 --> 01:45:42.612]  There's nobody watching the show, get up!
[01:45:42.612 --> 01:45:44.612]  Guys, can you get off my set, please?
[01:45:44.612 --> 01:45:46.612]  Don't get too mad, whatever.
[01:45:46.612 --> 01:45:48.612]  Alright, well, first of all...
[01:45:48.612 --> 01:45:50.612]  He's actually mad, you're actually really upset.
[01:45:50.612 --> 01:45:52.612]  I think you should have come to bed, man, I'm sure.
[01:45:52.612 --> 01:45:54.612]  Alright, alright, alright.
[01:45:54.612 --> 01:45:56.612]  Why are you guys looking at me?
[01:45:56.612 --> 01:45:58.612]  You're not listening to me!
[01:45:58.612 --> 01:46:00.612]  I'm like, "Dad, what are you doing?"
[01:46:00.612 --> 01:46:02.612]  We gotta do the show, you guys.
[01:46:02.612 --> 01:46:05.612]   You're just not ready for our fun, you're not ready to see us.
[01:46:05.612 --> 01:46:07.612]  Hey, first of all, let me explain something, alright?
[01:46:07.612 --> 01:46:09.612]  Okay, this is bullshit.
[01:46:09.612 --> 01:46:11.612]  Okay, hold on, hold on.
[01:46:11.612 --> 01:46:13.612]  Get this out of your head, you dumbass!
[01:46:14.078 --> 01:46:14.879]  Yes!
[01:46:14.919 --> 01:46:16.480]  We talk about that all the time!
[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:19.021]  We talk about that all the time!
[01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:21.363]  What do you think, the loser people aren't charged?
[01:46:21.423 --> 01:46:22.503]  Is that what you think?
[01:46:22.563 --> 01:46:25.065]  You're the anti-liberal and you're pissed.
[01:46:25.125 --> 01:46:25.645]  Bullshit!
[01:46:25.705 --> 01:46:26.686]  We're being nice here.
[01:46:26.726 --> 01:46:28.467]  You know what I care about?
[01:46:28.827 --> 01:46:30.827]  I care about the American people.
[01:46:30.827 --> 01:46:32.827]  You're the one who closed the house.
[01:46:32.827 --> 01:46:34.827]  You want to burn out or not?
[01:46:34.827 --> 01:46:36.827]  I'm not going to let you.
[01:46:36.827 --> 01:46:38.827]  I'm going to f*** you up.
[01:46:38.827 --> 01:46:40.827]  I'm going to f*** you up.
[01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:42.827]  I'm going to f*** you up.
[01:46:42.827 --> 01:46:44.827]  Jimmy Dore loves her.
[01:46:44.827 --> 01:46:46.827]  I'm not going to let you.
[01:46:46.827 --> 01:46:48.827]  I'm going to f*** you up.
[01:46:48.827 --> 01:46:50.827]  I'm going to f*** you up.
[01:46:50.827 --> 01:46:52.827]  I'm going to f*** you up.
[01:46:53.510 --> 01:47:03.738]  Okay, so if you're a radio listener, you just hear a bunch of yelling.
[01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:08.702]  I'll keep it on the video, but... It's in the middle of a sports stadium.
[01:47:09.062 --> 01:47:09.983]  Convention Center.
[01:47:11.417 --> 01:47:14.578]  And there's just radio and TV booths every 20 feet.
[01:47:15.278 --> 01:47:20.879]  So he's in the hallway and he sees Roger and then he lies.
[01:47:20.899 --> 01:47:23.280]  He goes back on air and says, Roger attacked our stage.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.160]  Roger came on his show.
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:26.460]  We tried to crash it.
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:30.161]  Roger was like walking 30 feet away down the hall and he saw him too.
[01:47:30.181 --> 01:47:31.481]  Because Roger was with us.
[01:47:31.982 --> 01:47:33.182]  I just got up on stage and said, hey, I'm here.
[01:47:33.202 --> 01:47:33.702]  You want to talk?
[01:47:35.762 --> 01:47:41.085]  And I gave him a Bill Clinton rape shirt when he wasn't even on air yet, and he got really, really mad about that.
[01:47:41.545 --> 01:47:46.828]  So now he wants to kick Joe Rogan's ass because he knows he'll never have to follow through with it.
[01:47:47.429 --> 01:47:49.770]  He just can now be in the news because he's so desperate.
[01:47:49.790 --> 01:48:01.136]  Because when it came out that, you know, they were funded by Soros in front of the Democratic Party and are worshipers of Hillary and, you know, threw Bernie under the bus and all that other stuff, they are a joke.
[01:48:01.617 --> 01:48:03.798]  And I'm sad that the young turds turned into that.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:06.101]  But I mean, when you're a turd, you're a turd.
[01:48:06.982 --> 01:48:14.028]  And they are named after the group that exterminated a million and a half Christians in Armenia.
[01:48:14.048 --> 01:48:21.614]  And I guess it's Stockholm Syndrome with the chick on there, because she claims, you know, that she is a Christian from that area of the world.
[01:48:22.415 --> 01:48:27.700]  So when you name yourself after basically the Turkish Hitler youth, that is not a good thing.
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:29.921]  That is not a good thing.
[01:48:31.042 --> 01:48:31.583]  So there you go.
[01:48:31.603 --> 01:48:32.584]  We had a little bit of fun with that.
[01:48:33.851 --> 01:48:38.135]  Blast from the past there, ladies and gentlemen, with St.
[01:48:38.675 --> 01:48:47.542]  Unger, acting like a fool, and then currently acting like a fool, saying that he's going to beat up Joe Rogan because he's bigger than Joe.
[01:48:47.642 --> 01:48:49.664]  Actually, he's about the height of Joe.
[01:48:50.885 --> 01:48:53.287]  And again, he looks like he had trouble walking.
[01:48:54.007 --> 01:48:55.969]  So, wow, pretty amazing.
[01:48:55.989 --> 01:48:56.870]  These people are all talk.
[01:48:57.230 --> 01:49:00.431]  A month ago, we sold out of our first shipment in only three days.
[01:49:00.871 --> 01:49:04.813]  It is Brain Force Ultra, the cleanest, purest energy you're gonna find anywhere.

[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:53.420]   When you take these products together in synergy, it is a game changer.
[01:49:53.297 --> 01:49:57.018]  So take up the BrainForce Ultra Challenge today at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:49:57.218 --> 01:50:04.621]  Well, I am very excited that we've got him for a little over an hour and 15 minutes, Dr. Vladimir Zev Zelenko.
[01:50:05.241 --> 01:50:18.307]  We had Dr. Richard Bartlett on, who said that he is a hero, the first person to develop a protocol, pretty much the start of it, with thousands of patients to prove it in New York State.
[01:50:19.227 --> 01:50:23.271]  For early at-home treatment with close to 100% success.
[01:50:24.472 --> 01:50:36.244]  And he joins us now to cover the waterfront, but I really wanted to get him on today so that he could speak to what I've heard him on other shows saying, because I don't just have him here, I watch him, I listen to what he has to say as a trailblazer.
[01:50:36.504 --> 01:50:37.385]  That's who I tune into.
[01:50:37.405 --> 01:50:40.328]  People that are right, not people that are wrong like CNN on purpose.
[01:50:41.391 --> 01:50:43.272]  And he's talking about we need to have tribunals.
[01:50:43.292 --> 01:50:46.393]  And that's not just some foggy thing off that we wish we were going to have.
[01:50:46.674 --> 01:50:49.875]  We better have it or they're going to keep with their great reset taking over with it.
[01:50:50.235 --> 01:50:51.756]  He's got the wide spectrum knowledge.
[01:50:51.776 --> 01:50:53.997]  You know, Senator Rand Paul's a doctor.
[01:50:54.017 --> 01:50:54.637]  He's a nice guy.
[01:50:54.677 --> 01:50:57.839]  He loves to defend the vaccine, but say natural immunity is better, which is true.
[01:50:58.459 --> 01:50:59.680]  But no, the studies are out.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:00.180]  It's deadly.
[01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:01.060]  It's causing blood clots.
[01:51:01.921 --> 01:51:06.223]  Ron Johnson, you know, is up there going, look, since we did the vaccines, there's more death and problems.
[01:51:06.883 --> 01:51:07.924]  But I'm still with the vaccine.
[01:51:09.201 --> 01:51:12.623]  It isn't a vaccine according to the developer of mRNA technology.
[01:51:12.983 --> 01:51:14.323]  He says it doesn't work for that.
[01:51:14.403 --> 01:51:15.024]  It's poisonous.
[01:51:15.404 --> 01:51:17.585]  And so does the former chief scientist at Pfizer.
[01:51:17.885 --> 01:51:20.326]  And so does the Nobel Prize winner for discovering HIV.
[01:51:20.846 --> 01:51:22.307]  It's a laundry list of who's who.
[01:51:22.787 --> 01:51:23.507]  Being censored.
[01:51:23.668 --> 01:51:26.589]  So, ZStackLife.com is his website.
[01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:29.570]  I want to show people this right now because he's totally vindicated.
[01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:32.231]  And we need to celebrate people that are trailblazers and right.
[01:51:32.531 --> 01:51:35.533]  Because those are the people that lead us out of the slavery.
[01:51:36.778 --> 01:51:38.259]  Gee, what could it be?
[01:51:38.519 --> 01:51:44.944]  UK newspaper reports mystery rise in heart attacks from blocked arteries.
[01:51:44.964 --> 01:51:44.944]  25%.
[01:51:45.464 --> 01:51:49.887]  Similar numbers in the US and Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.
[01:51:51.708 --> 01:51:51.808]  Oh!
[01:51:52.649 --> 01:51:53.750]  He's been vindicated again.
[01:51:53.770 --> 01:51:58.753]  Pfizer launches final study on COVID drug that's suspiciously similar to horsepace.
[01:51:59.053 --> 01:52:01.895]  Turns out it has the same active compounds in it.
[01:52:02.836 --> 01:52:02.956]  Oh!
[01:52:02.976 --> 01:52:03.496]  Wow!
[01:52:07.571 --> 01:52:09.132]  The Congress and its staff are exempt.
[01:52:09.152 --> 01:52:10.313]  The judicial branch is exempt.
[01:52:10.333 --> 01:52:11.233]  The White House is exempt.
[01:52:11.433 --> 01:52:12.414]  The CDC is exempt.
[01:52:13.675 --> 01:52:15.776]  I guess just like Nazis were exempt from going to death camps.
[01:52:15.816 --> 01:52:16.596]  I don't say that lightly.
[01:52:17.057 --> 01:52:18.597]  FDA employees exempt.
[01:52:18.938 --> 01:52:20.459]  USPS employees exempt.
[01:52:20.779 --> 01:52:21.919]  NIAID employees exempt.
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:23.320]  Pfizer employees exempt.
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:24.701]  Moderna employees exempt.
[01:52:24.761 --> 01:52:26.142]  Joe Rogan, I talked to you last night.
[01:52:27.628 --> 01:52:39.987]  All over the news has the left saying he made light of the Holocaust and that Joe Roguch will be taken off the air because he said, making us show an ID to buy and sell, making us take shots, is the same road that led to Nazi Germany.
[01:52:40.168 --> 01:52:42.631]  He didn't say it was Nazi Germany, he says it's the same road leading there.
[01:52:43.547 --> 01:52:54.112]  So I also thought that we would ask Dr. Zelenko, because he's a trailblazer, and he also happens to be Jewish, and it's talked about how he's had ancestors and people that have faced this type of thing before.
[01:52:54.592 --> 01:53:05.177]  And so I thought maybe up front, because he's been vindicated, we'd talk about my good friend Joe Rogan, who's under real sustained attack because he put out a minute and a half video, we'll air at the bottom of the hour, stating the obvious.
[01:53:05.197 --> 01:53:07.098]  So, Dr. Zelenko, have you seen the video?
[01:53:07.919 --> 01:53:10.720]  And first off, congratulations on being a trailblazer of trailblazers.
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:12.521]  And what do you think of what Joe Rogan said?
[01:53:14.022 --> 01:53:15.062]  Joe Rogan's a hero.
[01:53:15.863 --> 01:53:16.783]  I respect him.
[01:53:17.403 --> 01:53:34.247]  I think he has the platform and the courage to transmit the message of hope and lead us, be part of the solution to lead us out of this man-made, manufactured, slippery slope down to slavery.
[01:53:35.388 --> 01:53:43.150]  And I'd like to actually commemorate some historical events that happened this week, which is very relevant to me and relevant to us.
[01:53:44.228 --> 01:53:49.290]  This is the anniversary of the massacre at Babi Yar.
[01:53:50.270 --> 01:54:10.818]  Babi Yar is a woods outside of a ravine, actually, outside of Kiev, in the Ukraine, where around 100,000 innocent people were murdered, initially shot into the ravine, and then, when they ran out of bullets, they just pushed them in, bulldozed them in alive, and buried them alive.
[01:54:11.999 --> 01:54:13.159]  40 of which were my relatives.
[01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:39.186]  So when I talk about genocide and when I talk about Nazism and fascism and racism and malfeasance and such evil, it's not a theoretical concept for me, but very visceral and real to me.
[01:54:39.307 --> 01:54:52.449]   I grew up in stories about How my grandparents were soldiers, how my grandmothers were evacuated, how they witnessed people they loved murdered, slaughtered, and so on.
[01:54:52.489 --> 01:55:05.314]  So when I see what's going on now, I have the proper historical context, I think, to process and be able to tell you that there is a genocide going on right now.
[01:55:05.354 --> 01:55:06.734]  And I don't use that word gently.
[01:55:08.092 --> 01:55:19.081]  My family has been a victim of genocide, so I really am screaming that this is the genocide of the innocent, of the vulnerable, and of the people that we are obligated to protect.
[01:55:20.642 --> 01:55:29.610]  The only difference between this genocide and the genocide 80 years ago is that we're all Jewish, in a sense, from that perspective, because they're coming after all of us.
[01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:37.150]   The Nazi Holocaust was just a dry run For the eugenics program that we're witnessing now.
[01:55:37.690 --> 01:55:59.946]  And this so-called vaccine, which is really just nothing more than a poison death shot, which is an extension of a weapon of eugenics, has the following known effects, no one has the audacity to deny it, is that blood clots are killing probably already over 300,000 Americans, and that's an underestimate, I think.
[01:56:00.514 --> 01:56:03.574]  and causing heart attacks and strokes.
[01:56:03.574 --> 01:56:06.693]   And then you have myocarditis, which is inflammation of the hearts,
[01:56:06.693 --> 01:56:09.413]  which has a 50% mortality rate within five years.
[01:56:09.413 --> 01:56:14.613]   And miscarriage rates in the first trimester have gone up from 10% to 82%.
[01:56:14.613 --> 01:56:20.493]   The incidence of cancer and autoimmune diseases have skyrocketed.
[01:56:20.493 --> 01:56:24.453]   There is evidence of ovarian dysfunction and question about future infertility.
[01:56:24.453 --> 01:56:25.814]  And that's the light stuff.
[01:56:26.104 --> 01:56:36.972]  The real concern, which you mentioned, is this genocidal antibody-dependent enhancement concern that all the world experts are yelling, saying, stop, stop using these vaccines.
[01:56:37.312 --> 01:56:39.634]  They may lead to the genocide of billions of people dead.
[01:56:40.694 --> 01:56:54.982]   And this is what's being advocated and pushed in a tyrannical fashion on innocent Human beings, where there is zero medical necessity, because the young don't need it, near 100% of the kids, healthy kids, get better.
[01:56:55.483 --> 01:56:57.805]  The healthy adults get better with treatment near 100%.
[01:56:58.746 --> 01:57:03.491]   People that have had COVID have better immunity and are more immune than if they were vaccinated.
[01:57:03.952 --> 01:57:09.114]  And the high risk population, we could treat them properly, reduce the risk of death to less than 1%.
[01:57:09.574 --> 01:57:23.261]  So this is an artificially made global pandemic of fear and isolation used to manipulate global people into taking a poison death shot and to reduce the world population.
[01:57:23.601 --> 01:57:24.741]  And this is not a theory.
[01:57:24.761 --> 01:57:28.603]  It's definitely a conspiracy to commit mass murder and genocide, but it's not a theory.
[01:57:30.304 --> 01:57:32.185]  And that's been proven multiple times.
[01:57:32.805 --> 01:57:45.634]  You know, there are patent numbers associated with transformations of this virus from a bat coronavirus to a human virus done by Ralph Baric, as you know, and there's patents associated with that.
[01:57:45.694 --> 01:57:52.578]  And in Wuhan, they weaponized it and made it absolutely destructive, lethal to lungs, human lungs and blood clots.
[01:57:52.939 --> 01:57:55.906]   And then there's a patent that came out last Absolutely.
[01:57:56.167 --> 01:57:57.448]  So, by the way, don't believe a word I'm saying.
[01:57:57.268 --> 01:58:02.868]   technology both internal sensors where it measures the internal physiological
[01:58:02.868 --> 01:58:07.547]   data and then is able to transmit that data together with your location to a
[01:58:07.547 --> 01:58:11.667]   central server and that technology already exists and I have the patent
[01:58:11.667 --> 01:58:15.507]   number by the way I think I said the last time but I think it's good to
[01:58:15.507 --> 01:58:22.028]   mention it. So by the way don't believe a word I'm saying do your due
[01:58:22.028 --> 01:58:25.507]   diligence don't make the same mistake with me that you do with the government
[01:58:25.507 --> 01:58:27.507]  by believing everything blindly.
[01:58:28.424 --> 01:58:29.325]  Question everything.
[01:58:29.445 --> 01:58:35.628]  Take what I'm saying, don't believe me, vet what I'm saying, and see if I'm telling you the truth.
[01:58:36.148 --> 01:58:42.492]  United States patent number 11107588.
[01:58:42.612 --> 01:58:51.697]  Again, 11107588 describes the tracking technology and transmitting technology that already exists in the vaccine that you're being given to.
[01:58:52.608 --> 01:59:09.700]  So, and what's interesting is, I find this remarkable, the lipid nanoparticle delivery system basically ensures that toxic mRNA spike protein producing code is transferred into your nervous system.
[01:59:10.245 --> 01:59:12.528]  If you look in the, there was a slide.
[01:59:12.829 --> 01:59:13.650]  Doc, this is key.
[01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:16.413]  Let's come back and get right into this with Dr. Zelenko.
[01:59:16.434 --> 01:59:19.357]  Check out his website, ZStackLife.com.
[01:59:19.418 --> 01:59:21.500]  Dr. Vladimir Zelenko.
[01:59:21.781 --> 01:59:26.647]  This is on target stuff and millions of folks would have died with COVID if he hadn't made those discoveries.
[01:59:27.188 --> 01:59:30.569]  We've got Dr. Vladimir Zevzalenko on the line with us.
[01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:33.290]  I've got a lot of questions, a lot of clips, a lot of things I want to go over with him.
[01:59:33.711 --> 01:59:43.555]  But he got caught off by the break getting into the real dangers and getting into the antibody enhancement situation and getting into what we're beginning to see.
[01:59:43.575 --> 01:59:44.395]  You got caught off of the break.
[01:59:44.415 --> 01:59:45.235]  Please continue, doctor.
[01:59:47.276 --> 01:59:48.657]  You remind me what was the last thing I said?
[01:59:48.957 --> 01:59:50.377]  I forget.
[01:59:50.457 --> 01:59:56.080]  You were going into more ways it's attacking people and more things it was doing and then we hit the break.
[01:59:57.998 --> 02:00:03.681]  Yeah, I mean, this is a artificially made bioweapon.
[02:00:03.741 --> 02:00:05.042]  Everyone realizes that now.
[02:00:05.442 --> 02:00:06.843]  There's no debate about that.
[02:00:06.963 --> 02:00:12.205]  And it's been designed to create global fear and isolation.
[02:00:12.726 --> 02:00:31.513]   And that global fear and isolation has been designed to psychologically wage warfare on the innocent human mind and psychologically decompensate people so that they become extremely gullible and willing to take I really do mean it's a poison death shot.
[02:00:31.593 --> 02:00:32.933]  It has no medical necessity.
[02:00:32.953 --> 02:00:39.234]  It doesn't work and has these really horrific eugenics type of effects.
[02:00:39.654 --> 02:00:44.135]  What it does is it has several layers and waves of death.
[02:00:44.575 --> 02:00:49.756]  There's the acute death, which happens within the three months due to blood clots and inflammation of hearts and miscarriages.
[02:00:50.277 --> 02:01:12.280]   Then there is that antibody-dependent enhancement concern, which is basically the person's immune system will kill the The host organism when challenged with the virus that they're immunized against, and that has been seen since the 60s in the RSV vaccine, 70s the dengue fever virus vaccine, and the 80s and 90s all the previous attempts of coronaviruses vaccines.
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:19.703]  And what's interesting is, wouldn't you think it's a good idea to exclude antibody-dependent enhancement from the human race before you immunize someone?
[02:01:20.649 --> 02:01:21.409]  Billion people?
[02:01:21.930 --> 02:01:26.649]   Absolutely, for those that don't know, a lot's been talked about it, but what's the easiest
[02:01:26.649 --> 02:01:30.490]   way for people listening to explain to their friends and family about what this well-known
[02:01:30.490 --> 02:01:32.050]  syndrome is?
[02:01:32.050 --> 02:01:39.369]   Well, look, usually when someone is exposed to a virus, they develop an antibody response.
[02:01:39.395 --> 02:01:45.496]  Those antibodies then are protective and are designed to protect you from getting future infections.
[02:01:45.957 --> 02:01:49.597]  That's why people don't usually get measles twice or mumps or chickenpox twice.
[02:01:50.138 --> 02:01:58.219]  Now, an attempt to artificially produce that by giving vaccines, in some cases is successful, in other cases it's not successful.
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:07.729]   And in the history of coronavirus vaccines, there have been multiple attempts to make Um, vaccines at work.
[02:02:07.789 --> 02:02:15.037]  The problem was that once the animals were immunized, they developed an antibody response and everyone was happy.
[02:02:15.557 --> 02:02:22.866]  But then, when we challenged those animals with the virus that they were immunized against, the animals died.
[02:02:23.723 --> 02:02:24.203]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:02:24.364 --> 02:02:27.766]  You're trying to protect and preserve the life of the animal.
[02:02:27.806 --> 02:02:28.527]  Why was it dying?
[02:02:29.047 --> 02:02:37.534]  No one really understood it until they did more research and they saw that it was the actual immune reaction that your antibodies became bombs.
[02:02:38.214 --> 02:02:49.043]  And when they came into contact with the virus that they were immunized against, resulted in a lethal, homicidal, lethal reaction in the host organism.
[02:02:50.304 --> 02:02:52.065]  All the coronavirus vaccines have shown it.
[02:02:52.475 --> 02:02:53.536]  Including these.
[02:02:54.116 --> 02:02:55.297]  So the question would be like this.
[02:02:55.957 --> 02:03:13.509]  You can argue maybe that human beings are different than animals, and I would say maybe, but wouldn't it be a good idea to exclude that phenomenon from the human race before you deploy an experimental, artificially made liquid into seven billion people?
[02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:22.889]   And the answer is logically you would want to exclude that unless you already know the answer and unless your desire is not
[02:03:22.889 --> 02:03:27.189]   to help people but to reduce the world population. And Dr. I'm watching rational hearings I'm not
[02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:33.658]   a doctor like you but I believe that I've even seen supporters of the shots testify this this this
[02:03:33.658 --> 02:03:40.928]   dean of uh of virology and things uh at Baylor here in Texas saying oh we've tried to make vaccines
[02:03:40.928 --> 02:03:47.209]   for the common flu before but it creates the antibody enhancement syndrome sometimes.
[02:03:45.575 --> 02:03:47.396]  And we had humans die in the trial.
[02:03:47.476 --> 02:03:50.779]  So haven't there been some cases where they tried this and it killed people?
[02:03:50.799 --> 02:03:52.060]  Because they've said that in Congress.
[02:03:53.181 --> 02:03:56.563]  Yeah, they did it with the RSV vaccine, which killed more kids than RSV.
[02:03:57.564 --> 02:03:59.866]  We did it with the dengue virus.
[02:04:00.767 --> 02:04:07.654]   Dengue fever virus vaccine killed more adults than So, this has been a known phenomenon.
[02:04:07.674 --> 02:04:08.795]  This is not unheard of.
[02:04:09.116 --> 02:04:13.461]  And that's why world experts are screaming the following.
[02:04:14.262 --> 02:04:16.925]  You're on the verge of killing off billions of people.
[02:04:18.908 --> 02:04:21.591]  It's a big gamble to make with innocent people, don't you think?
[02:04:21.972 --> 02:04:22.833]  And for what?
[02:04:22.893 --> 02:04:30.121]  For a virus that, if every single human being on the planet got COVID-19 and was treated properly, the death rate would be less than five?
[02:04:30.461 --> 02:04:33.565]  But obviously, as you've said, Doctor, they didn't gamble with this.
[02:04:33.605 --> 02:04:34.866]  The same people running it say...
[02:04:35.427 --> 02:04:48.893]  They want to depopulate us, and you predicted over a year ago, and others did, that when people start dying, they're going to blame the vaccinated, which there's no of the unvaccinated, which is now the setup to be poisoning and killing one group, and then tell them that the unvaccinated are the ones killing them.
[02:04:49.253 --> 02:04:49.894]  What a plan!
[02:04:51.314 --> 02:04:53.255]  It's pretty brilliantly evil.
[02:04:54.796 --> 02:05:02.980]  So the key here, this animal that you're showing on the screen right now, is a sociopath of historic scale.
[02:05:03.883 --> 02:05:08.066]  And is on record calling for the reduction of the world population.
[02:05:09.027 --> 02:05:24.039]  And I'm supposed to take a vaccine for my health from this sociopathic animal, Bill Gates, who the whole world is suffering because of his narcissism, because he couldn't get a girlfriend in high school, so now he has to take out his anger on every single human being on the planet.
[02:05:24.439 --> 02:05:26.581]  He gets off by stepping on your grave.
[02:05:27.461 --> 02:05:34.642]   This is a monster, and he's a symbol of a concept These are Hitler and Stalin together on steroids.
[02:05:35.723 --> 02:05:38.947]  And yes, they should be brought on military trial.
[02:05:39.588 --> 02:05:41.389]  This is a war crime.
[02:05:41.550 --> 02:05:42.871]  We're in World War III.
[02:05:43.652 --> 02:05:47.135]  More than 200 countries are fighting the same invisible, artificially made enemy.
[02:05:48.157 --> 02:06:02.184]   And they have propagated fear and have obstructed anything that has an illegitimate treatment value that has an ability to reduce the fear and restore humanity to some semblance of normality.
[02:06:02.565 --> 02:06:16.273]  These animals, these worse than animals, these sociopathic vermin, what they are trying to do is prolong the fear to get more and more people to take this poison death shot.
[02:06:16.773 --> 02:06:18.234]  Essentially, this is what's happening.
[02:06:18.774 --> 02:06:29.773]   You are, not you, but we are walking into the gas chambers Rolling up our sleeve, asking to get a shot, getting a shot, smiling, paying them, and saying, thank you for killing us.
[02:06:30.433 --> 02:06:31.514]  Which is a smart weapon.
[02:06:31.574 --> 02:06:36.436]  When Hitler's, Barbarossa first went into Russia, they didn't like the Communists, so they saw him as a savior.
[02:06:36.516 --> 02:06:39.877]  Then they started killing everybody, they fought back, and the Russians beat Hitler.
[02:06:40.578 --> 02:06:41.638]  But it's the same thing here.
[02:06:41.678 --> 02:06:45.500]  If Hitler would have given people shots that killed them in two or three years, they would have never known.
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:47.180]  So they've just learned from history.
[02:06:51.351 --> 02:06:56.856]  History repeating itself, but on a scale that has never been seen before.
[02:06:57.376 --> 02:07:09.267]  We are on the verge of witnessing billions of people dying, corpses rotting in the streets, and people are too delusional to believe that that's not possible.
[02:07:09.667 --> 02:07:14.952]  But it's very possible, and this has been the planned agenda of people for decades.
[02:07:15.352 --> 02:07:21.226]   This has not been Recently concocted because look in order to pull this off.
[02:07:21.246 --> 02:07:55.002]   You need the coordination of major global industries Four or five major industries have to work in unison be able to pull off the worst crime in history Which is what when you need to control the media both social and mainstream you need the control of academia you need the control of politics and you need the control of industry in the pharmaceutical industry and There are only a few people on this planet that have Our stakeholders in all those industries that are able to influence those industries in a coordinated fashion to pull off what they're doing.
[02:07:55.464 --> 02:07:57.946]  And those are the people, and I don't know exactly who they are.
[02:07:57.966 --> 02:07:59.728]  I have some idea who some of them are.
[02:07:59.748 --> 02:08:04.752]  Well, Doc, you've come to the right place, because you're an expert in medical stuff, and you've also figured this out for yourself, but I've read their writings.
[02:08:04.792 --> 02:08:05.452]  I know you have as well.
[02:08:05.913 --> 02:08:13.119]  It's Bill Gates, it's Klaus Schwab, and then it's some of the royal families and some of the big money, the big classic families that went underground, all the robber barons.
[02:08:13.459 --> 02:08:14.840]  The Rockefellers are right at the heart of it.
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:16.281]  They all write books.
[02:08:16.321 --> 02:08:17.943]  They're all on record saying they wanted this.
[02:08:18.263 --> 02:08:22.947]  They wrote Operation Lockstep, planning it all out 11 years ago, and it's them, sir.
[02:08:24.161 --> 02:08:41.492]  Yes, that I know, but I would even argue that the real villains are too smart to be in the media, that there's going to be a layer of evil that is so smart, when you get to the core of the onion, they may even transcend those people that you're saying, because they're too smart to put themselves out there.
[02:08:41.974 --> 02:08:44.716]  That's what all the top-level folks that I know that have headed up U.S.
[02:08:44.777 --> 02:08:45.978]  intelligence agencies and others tell me.
[02:08:45.998 --> 02:08:50.401]  They just say, the real rulers are completely insulated and work through Schwab and Gates.
[02:08:51.042 --> 02:08:56.827]  But we better know, Gates and Schwab are literally the field marshals, along with the head of Pfizer, that are running the attack.
[02:08:57.908 --> 02:09:08.457]  Yes, I agree with that, including the, look, the primordial, we're dealing with the primordial snake, the primordial serpent, and it's now in clothes and body, and it has different heads.
[02:09:09.426 --> 02:09:11.407]  Obviously the Chinese Communist Party is one head.
[02:09:11.707 --> 02:09:13.368]  Bill Gates is another head.
[02:09:13.708 --> 02:09:15.309]  World Economic Forum is another head.
[02:09:15.690 --> 02:09:18.391]  But it's the totality of the evil.
[02:09:18.471 --> 02:09:34.127]   They may even have different agendas, but one thing they share in common, which is the enslavement of innocent people, because ultimately they derive their perverse sexual pleasure of controlling others and destroying others. They
[02:09:34.127 --> 02:09:35.387]  want our will turned to them.
[02:09:35.387 --> 02:09:38.667]   You're absolutely on target. I want to come back with you to get more into wherever you
[02:09:38.667 --> 02:09:41.507]   want to go. I got a bunch of questions. I got the Joe Rogan video. I want your take
[02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:45.627]   on it because you're calling this bad and evil. It's powerful. And last time I checked,
[02:09:45.627 --> 02:09:50.627]   it's got like 15 million views now. And so absolutely, we get Joe Rogan fully awake.
[02:09:50.627 --> 02:09:54.188]   They're in trouble. And it's it's happened, folks. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:09:54.188 --> 02:09:57.347]  All right. This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:09:58.219 --> 02:10:03.161]  And we've got Dr. Zelenko here with us that, again, out of everybody out there, he gets it more than anybody else we've talked to.
[02:10:03.261 --> 02:10:04.621]  And he's a medical doctor on top of it.
[02:10:04.722 --> 02:10:11.685]  And he trailblazed things they try to suppress that, conservatively around the world, have saved millions of people, including my dad.
[02:10:11.705 --> 02:10:14.806]  He didn't tell me he was sick with COVID when I got there.
[02:10:14.966 --> 02:10:15.447]  82, oxygen.
[02:10:15.807 --> 02:10:16.367]  Couldn't get up.
[02:10:16.387 --> 02:10:17.087]  Looked like he was dead.
[02:10:17.167 --> 02:10:18.368]  Blue in the bed.
[02:10:18.988 --> 02:10:21.569]  Looked like he was 90 years old instead of 71.
[02:10:23.274 --> 02:10:29.143]  And once he got on the things that Dr. Zelenko and Dr. Bartlett talked about, next day again, he was 90% better.
[02:10:31.044 --> 02:10:31.544]  Incredible.
[02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:33.925]  And I know, I mean, I thought he was dead when I got there.
[02:10:34.365 --> 02:10:35.825]  If they had put him in the hospital, he'd have been dead.
[02:10:36.846 --> 02:10:37.846]  Sir, let's do this here.
[02:10:37.866 --> 02:10:41.707]  Let's tell people in the next 45 minutes what you're going to break down.
[02:10:41.727 --> 02:10:42.567]  I'd go longer than that.
[02:10:42.587 --> 02:10:43.087]  I know you would, too.
[02:10:43.107 --> 02:10:45.068]  I've got to go to a meeting right at 3 Central.
[02:10:45.108 --> 02:10:45.808]  I know you've got to go, too.
[02:10:45.848 --> 02:10:48.509]  But what is it you want to hit when we come back in the next segment?
[02:10:48.529 --> 02:10:50.789]  Because I'm going to try to give you the floor to continue.
[02:10:50.809 --> 02:10:58.892]  And I think where you were already going when we hit the break was identifying this, admitting it to ourselves, and really coming to grips with the fact that we are in World War III.
[02:10:58.952 --> 02:11:00.312]  I totally agree with the way you put it.
[02:11:00.632 --> 02:11:01.012]  That's it.
[02:11:02.774 --> 02:11:09.800]  Well, World War III is exactly that, and our response, we have to shift from peace footing to war footing.
[02:11:10.199 --> 02:11:18.861]  That includes the military tribunals, but more importantly, the way we approach life, the way we approach medicine, the way we approach time itself.
[02:11:19.341 --> 02:11:24.682]  We don't have time to spend two, three, four years doing research while millions of people die.
[02:11:24.702 --> 02:11:27.583]  We need to improvise on the ground, like good Marines, you know?
[02:11:28.163 --> 02:11:37.443]   And you assess the situation, you change on the fly, and you try through trial and error different strategies until you
[02:11:37.443 --> 02:11:38.323]  find one that works.
[02:11:38.323 --> 02:11:39.604]  That's exactly what I did.
[02:11:39.604 --> 02:11:48.084]   In March of 2020, I had thousands, hundreds, probably thousands of sick patients with no treatment.
[02:11:48.352 --> 02:11:49.252]  What are you supposed to do?
[02:11:49.272 --> 02:11:49.872]  Let them die?
[02:11:49.892 --> 02:11:52.653]  The whole government was telling us to send them home.
[02:11:52.993 --> 02:11:54.354]  The government is still telling us.
[02:11:54.374 --> 02:11:59.395]  The NIH, as of today, tells you don't treat COVID, go home, then go to the hospital.
[02:11:59.775 --> 02:12:02.316]  And if the oxygen is less than 92, then you should be treated.
[02:12:02.796 --> 02:12:04.977]  That's a policy of a government that wants you to die.
[02:12:05.817 --> 02:12:09.558]  It's not a policy of a government that is consistent with evidence-based medicine.
[02:12:10.091 --> 02:12:13.954]  All the evidence shows that if you treat early, you reduce death by 85%.
[02:12:13.994 --> 02:12:18.457]  Outside of 600,000 dead Americans, we could have kept 510,000 home.
[02:12:18.477 --> 02:12:22.719]  Forget about going to the hospital and dying.
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:30.384]  So, any policy that obstructs early pre-hospital treatment is a policy of death, is a policy of the Satan.
[02:12:31.425 --> 02:12:33.767]  And this is what our government is.
[02:12:35.268 --> 02:12:55.156]   And I'm sorry to say this, I have to be realistic and I have to protect And I feel I have to let the world know that we are being slaughtered by a few sociopathic corrupt oligarchs and political and corrupt governments and false promises.
[02:12:55.396 --> 02:13:03.700]  And we need to stop listening to these people saying, no, I'm not going to let you kill me and my family and the people I love.
[02:13:04.621 --> 02:13:04.821]  No!
[02:13:05.914 --> 02:13:08.778]  And come to my house and try to put a shot into my arm.
[02:13:08.838 --> 02:13:09.779]  Let's see what happens to you.
[02:13:10.019 --> 02:13:11.020]  You'll get a different shot.
[02:13:11.461 --> 02:13:22.955]  The difference between us and Australia now, where they're building gulags already and then turning people into quarantine facilities and putting ankle braces on people who don't want to take the shot, is that we have 450 million guns.
[02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:26.677]  And the government knows that.
[02:13:26.718 --> 02:13:34.861]  That's why Biden's administration hasn't sent in stormtroopers into each individual house, forcing you to get this vaccine, because they know they're going to get shot.
[02:13:35.322 --> 02:13:43.826]  And by the way, we've now confirmed they are calling the CDC people at their houses and admitting they have a database saying, you're not vaccinated, you should take it.
[02:13:44.086 --> 02:13:46.107]  That is a total violation of people's health rights, isn't it?
[02:13:47.748 --> 02:13:58.468]   It's a setup for a police state forced vaccination, literally forced murder.
[02:14:00.994 --> 02:14:07.137]  We're back in 60 seconds and I want to back up what you're saying with just on its face evidence, prima facie evidence.
[02:14:08.626 --> 02:14:11.888]  That they're not just saying, oh, you're sick, go home and wait till we put you on a ventilator.
[02:14:12.108 --> 02:14:21.753]  Oh, they're trying to block the treatments, which we now know they know work, and they have the studies, and now they're creating clones of what Dr. Zelenko and others discovered.
[02:14:22.913 --> 02:14:24.474]  It's just incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:24.514 --> 02:14:26.875]  This is World War III.
[02:14:26.915 --> 02:14:28.276]  This is the Great Reset.
[02:14:28.296 --> 02:14:33.138]  This is the world as we know it being destroyed on its ashes, the Build Back Better program.
[02:14:34.519 --> 02:14:35.539]  We're simpatico on this.
[02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:38.121]  We're synced up because we're all living in the same world, seeing the same thing.
[02:14:39.923 --> 02:14:41.463]  We've already proven they're poisoning us.
[02:14:41.563 --> 02:14:42.804]  We've already proven it doesn't work.
[02:14:42.864 --> 02:14:46.305]  We're already proven in their own documents they're doing it for authoritarian power and control.
[02:14:46.325 --> 02:14:51.286]  And the people running it, quote, meet in secret to discuss plans for global foresty population.
[02:14:51.326 --> 02:14:52.187]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[02:14:52.867 --> 02:14:55.207]  So I've been warning of this for 30 years.
[02:14:55.367 --> 02:14:59.829]  I've been on Air 28, but I was involved politically before then because I learned about this reading history books.
[02:14:59.929 --> 02:15:04.690]  And I also had family that had done things and been places that knew about this.
[02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:12.653]   My mother's brother, who's dead now, Worked in secret operations at the Pentagon and in Iran-Contra and other things, and he told me all this.
[02:15:13.953 --> 02:15:20.476]  And my dad, they tried to recruit him and told him all this stuff at UT when he was in high school going to UT.
[02:15:20.816 --> 02:15:23.957]  So I grew up knowing this was the plan, then I'm living it now.
[02:15:24.637 --> 02:15:29.699]  Okay, so I was blessed to have people in my family that knew about that and told me what was really going on.
[02:15:30.515 --> 02:15:30.795]  Okay?
[02:15:31.275 --> 02:15:33.777]  My dad didn't tell me until I came out with Endgame 14 years ago.
[02:15:34.097 --> 02:15:35.037]  He hadn't told me very much.
[02:15:35.077 --> 02:15:35.898]  My mother didn't know.
[02:15:36.258 --> 02:15:38.679]  She saw the film and said, David, this can't be this bad.
[02:15:38.719 --> 02:15:41.000]  He said, no, actually, that's what they said when I was 15.
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:45.422]  I went to UT, and they recruited me, and I was one of the top test scorers, and they admitted it all.
[02:15:45.863 --> 02:15:49.004]  So this has been a long-term plan.
[02:15:49.284 --> 02:15:51.465]  And they told my dad, they said, look, Hitler was bad.
[02:15:51.505 --> 02:15:52.606]  He went after one or two groups.
[02:15:53.066 --> 02:15:54.127]  We're going to go after everybody.
[02:15:54.327 --> 02:15:55.708]  And my dad's like, I'm getting out of this.
[02:15:56.268 --> 02:15:58.029]  They didn't tell him until he was 18, actually, at UT.
[02:15:58.849 --> 02:16:01.635]  So that's how real this all is.
[02:16:02.317 --> 02:16:04.882]  My dad's a very private person, but I should get him on here to tell you all this.
[02:16:05.824 --> 02:16:08.991]  He sat there with the head of the UT Botany Department, Professor Spear.
[02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:11.221]  And he told this to his face.
[02:16:12.201 --> 02:16:14.022]  So, that's the real world.
[02:16:14.042 --> 02:16:16.604]  My mom's like, I remember having dinner with Spear when we went to UT.
[02:16:17.044 --> 02:16:19.605]  So that's the level my dad was at in this and he got out of it.
[02:16:20.126 --> 02:16:28.871]  So Dr. Zelenko's here with us, but to me the biggest proof isn't just the science, the facts, the research, all the admissions, the skyrocketing heart attacks and blood clots that you predicted and others did.
[02:16:29.551 --> 02:16:40.395]  It's them trying to block hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and now trying to ration Regeneron and trying to do all this and then while secretly making it themselves and preparing drugs I guess for them.
[02:16:40.415 --> 02:16:52.902]   It's just, but you said it on another show, coming to grips with something This evil, this out of control, is hard for the average person because I'm, I think, a tough guy.
[02:16:53.002 --> 02:16:53.722]  I can barely handle it.
[02:16:54.023 --> 02:16:56.164]  You're obviously a smart, tough guy.
[02:16:56.404 --> 02:16:58.005]  I can see you having trouble, but you're facing it.
[02:16:58.966 --> 02:17:04.770]  How do we get the general public that just has a normalcy bias to not be in Stockholm Syndrome and come out of this?
[02:17:04.850 --> 02:17:06.631]  And then what do we do to oppose this?
[02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:08.873]  You said war footing is what's needed.
[02:17:08.933 --> 02:17:13.436]  So please tell us what a war footing is and speak to that because this is the rest of our lives.
[02:17:13.476 --> 02:17:14.157]  This is the big war.
[02:17:14.557 --> 02:17:15.838]  This is a covert operation.
[02:17:15.858 --> 02:17:17.319]  They admit it and we're in it right now.
[02:17:17.519 --> 02:17:17.999]  What do we do?
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:22.122]  So I'm not trying to save everyone.
[02:17:23.943 --> 02:17:29.727]  What I believe is the equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome.
[02:17:29.847 --> 02:17:32.348]  That's the difference between capitalism and communism.
[02:17:32.388 --> 02:17:34.690]  In other words, I don't think everyone needs to survive.
[02:17:35.373 --> 02:17:45.099]  I think everyone needs to have all the information presented to them so they can make their own intelligent choices, use their consciousness and free will to choose.
[02:17:45.199 --> 02:17:47.461]  But in order to choose, you have to have all their information.
[02:17:47.921 --> 02:18:00.769]   So I've made it a mission in my life, no matter how much life I have left in me, to inform the world about the counter-narratives so that people can make educated, intelligent decisions.
[02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:02.090]  And again, don't trust me.
[02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:03.611]  Verify everything that I'm saying.
[02:18:04.092 --> 02:18:20.923]  So, in other words, I believe that God is testing every single human being, and I think this is the test that he's had enough of paganism, child sacrifice, idol worship, and what he's done is created a system where each individual human being is forced to make a binary choice.
[02:18:21.828 --> 02:18:23.530]  Are you going to bow down to the Creator?
[02:18:23.550 --> 02:18:25.613]  Are you going to bow down and ask Him for salvation?
[02:18:26.373 --> 02:18:28.296]  Because He's making you every second as a gift.
[02:18:28.676 --> 02:18:29.397]  Happy birthday, Alex.
[02:18:29.437 --> 02:18:30.037]  He just made you.
[02:18:30.478 --> 02:18:37.365]  Or are you going to bow down to the false gods and the false promises, the golden calf of the vaccine and the sociopaths and corrupt governments?
[02:18:37.666 --> 02:18:40.209]  Because if that's the angle you choose, then let them protect you.
[02:18:40.229 --> 02:18:41.250]  Let's see how that's going to work out.
[02:18:41.912 --> 02:18:44.032]  But ultimately, I think that that's the choice.
[02:18:44.452 --> 02:18:45.773]  It's in the individual.
[02:18:46.233 --> 02:18:51.994]  Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst, said that the moral degradation of a society begins with the degradation of the individual.
[02:18:52.534 --> 02:18:58.455]  By the opposite, you can learn out that the moral improvement of a society begins with the moral refinement of the individual.
[02:18:58.795 --> 02:19:07.416]  So I can't control what you, Alex, do, but I can control what I do, how I think, how I speak, and how I act, and how I respect God's creation by sanctifying life.
[02:19:07.876 --> 02:19:14.042]   And I think that is required on the individual basis Turn away from bad and to do good and live.
[02:19:14.062 --> 02:19:15.863]  That's the prescription of King David.
[02:19:15.883 --> 02:19:17.945]  He says it in the Psalms of David.
[02:19:18.225 --> 02:19:23.650]  Turn away from bad, which means stay away from the poison death shot, don't live in fear, don't live in isolation.
[02:19:24.010 --> 02:19:29.635]  Do good means take early treatment and prophylaxis if you're high risk and you'll live.
[02:19:30.235 --> 02:19:39.376]   Do not give in or submit to the tyranny because they are very astute at dividing us And making us believe that we're isolated.
[02:19:39.436 --> 02:19:41.557]  In reality, there's many, many more of us.
[02:19:42.037 --> 02:19:43.278]  We have more guns than them.
[02:19:43.618 --> 02:19:49.681]  They're afraid of the enemies, afraid of an informed public that will coalesce together and just turn around.
[02:19:49.861 --> 02:19:51.201]  Let me ask you, what would stop?
[02:19:52.742 --> 02:19:59.485]  Why is it the one Nazi guard with a German shepherd and a machine gun could corral 2000 Jews to their death in a gas chamber?
[02:20:00.105 --> 02:20:10.724]   And the answer is very simple, because they were able to demoralize And isolate and create fear in the psychology of the victim so that they had no resolve to fight back.
[02:20:11.244 --> 02:20:15.765]  What would it have taken for them to turn around and stomp this guy, this guard, to death?
[02:20:17.066 --> 02:20:18.506]  There's 2,000 of them, there's one of him.
[02:20:18.526 --> 02:20:20.786]  So that's the key here.
[02:20:20.846 --> 02:20:29.028]  We can turn around and look the enemy into the eye and say, I'm just going to curse, but say, no, we're not going to submit to your tyranny.
[02:20:29.568 --> 02:20:30.688]  You can go burn in hell.
[02:20:31.228 --> 02:20:33.569]  And you will burn in hell, in this world and in the world to come.
[02:20:34.577 --> 02:20:34.857]  Okay?
[02:20:35.057 --> 02:20:36.638]  You want to start a war?
[02:20:36.718 --> 02:20:37.758]  So let's start the war.
[02:20:37.798 --> 02:20:38.698]  Let's really start it.
[02:20:38.978 --> 02:20:40.319]  Let's stop playing games anymore.
[02:20:40.559 --> 02:20:44.740]  Let's bring it to the surface, and let's see which side is going to be left standing.
[02:20:45.541 --> 02:20:45.821]  I agree.
[02:20:45.861 --> 02:20:48.542]  Let's talk about standing up, saying no.
[02:20:48.582 --> 02:20:53.703]  I think we have to fully identify it, and not eat around the edges like Rand Paul, or eat around the edges like others.
[02:20:53.723 --> 02:20:56.364]  We have to come... Because I've talked to a lot of these guys behind the scenes.
[02:20:56.384 --> 02:20:57.164]  They know all this stuff.
[02:20:57.184 --> 02:20:57.845]  They're smart, too.
[02:20:58.165 --> 02:20:59.745]  But they just think the public can't handle it.
[02:20:59.985 --> 02:21:01.606]  The only thing that's going to save us is the truth.
[02:21:01.646 --> 02:21:02.086]  Isn't that right?
[02:21:04.406 --> 02:21:06.867]  The truth is what leads to good decision-making.
[02:21:07.587 --> 02:21:15.509]  There are some people that are... You know, if you study biblical history, you'll see that only 20% of the Jews left Egypt.
[02:21:15.529 --> 02:21:17.970]  80% chose to stay and die in slavery.
[02:21:18.390 --> 02:21:22.631]  And out of those 20% that left Egypt, 50% or so died in the desert.
[02:21:23.591 --> 02:21:34.765]   So only 1 out of 10 Jews were able to leave Egyptian slavery or slave mentality and make it to Israel or the redemptive of thinking required to live in Israel.
[02:21:34.985 --> 02:21:36.705]  And I don't see it much different now.
[02:21:36.725 --> 02:21:45.407]  There's only around 10% of humanity that is capable of making the psychological transition from being a slave to man to being a servant of a God.
[02:21:46.088 --> 02:21:59.848]   I hope that number increases, and I do believe in the power of human choice, and I do believe that every single individual has the potential to turn away from bad and do good, and to choose To choose God.
[02:21:59.908 --> 02:22:01.589]  Now, is that Alexander Solzhenitsyn?
[02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.730]  Yes, sir, it is.
[02:22:03.610 --> 02:22:07.693]  I want to share a story from his book, Gulag Archipelago, which changed my life.
[02:22:07.733 --> 02:22:08.754]  I was going to say it before.
[02:22:08.774 --> 02:22:11.015]  I can't believe you brought him up.
[02:22:11.516 --> 02:22:18.761]  So he writes in his book, it's a 2700 page scream at the horrors of what human beings are capable of doing.
[02:22:18.781 --> 02:22:20.922]  He survived Stalin's gulags.
[02:22:21.462 --> 02:22:26.083]   So he writes that Stalin wanted to build a canal from Moscow to another city.
[02:22:26.103 --> 02:22:29.184]  He used the Gulag prisoners to do it.
[02:22:29.204 --> 02:22:30.824]  400,000 died.
[02:22:31.124 --> 02:22:34.625]  Their corpses were entombed in the cement that were part of the canal.
[02:22:34.845 --> 02:22:39.826]  When the canal was finished, not one ship ever used it because it was too shallow.
[02:22:40.526 --> 02:22:42.887]  The question was, why was this canal built?
[02:22:44.527 --> 02:22:45.708]  The answer was that 400,000 people should die.
[02:22:48.359 --> 02:22:48.719]  Wow.
[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:51.261]  And that's what we're going through right now.
[02:22:51.522 --> 02:22:52.422]  People don't realize it.
[02:22:52.803 --> 02:22:58.127]  This is a process of, people call it a calling, but I really think... Hold on, Dr. Stahner.
[02:22:58.167 --> 02:22:59.107]  Hard breaks for the satellites.
[02:22:59.127 --> 02:23:02.370]  Let's come back and get into that and talk about how they want us to worship them.
[02:23:02.390 --> 02:23:10.356]  The governor of New York said, I am your priestess and God talks to me and you're my disciples and those that don't take the shot, they don't talk to God.
[02:23:10.496 --> 02:23:10.777]  Wow.
[02:23:12.805 --> 02:23:18.688]  Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Gulag Archipelago, oh how we burned in the camps later, wishing we would have stood up and fought, to paraphrase him.
[02:23:19.409 --> 02:23:21.950]  And yes, I never read the whole book, I'll be honest.
[02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:24.271]  It's heavy reading, but I have read probably 500 pages of it.
[02:23:24.291 --> 02:23:31.756]  I think I read like in college a boiled down version of it, a major amended or abridged version.
[02:23:32.156 --> 02:23:45.706]   But Dr. Zelenko, you were here on the Alex Jones Show getting into the fact that Stalin built a system that A canal that didn't work, because that was just the whole cover of working people to death, starving them to death.
[02:23:45.786 --> 02:23:47.607]  I mean, that's the plan.
[02:23:47.627 --> 02:23:50.168]  I mean, Lennon was asked, how many villagers do we kill?
[02:23:50.188 --> 02:23:51.028]  They're submitting, sir.
[02:23:51.048 --> 02:23:51.688]  They've surrendered.
[02:23:51.708 --> 02:23:53.909]  They want to, he just said, just kill half of them.
[02:23:53.929 --> 02:23:54.829]  I want fear.
[02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:57.350]  But like you said, it's a spiritual thing.
[02:23:57.370 --> 02:24:06.192]  And they sexually, Hitler would, this is in Nazi writings, it's not made up stuff about him, would sit there during the Eastern Front and go out to it by train.
[02:24:07.543 --> 02:24:11.746]  And just stay up 20 hours looking through binoculars and telescopes at burning and bombing.
[02:24:11.786 --> 02:24:13.747]  He just loved death and loved it all.
[02:24:14.007 --> 02:24:17.210]  So for him it was, you know, the journey was the destination.
[02:24:17.250 --> 02:24:18.050]  Is that what you're getting at?
[02:24:19.631 --> 02:24:32.120]  Yeah, the forces of evil derive this perverse pleasure in the destruction of the world, of humanity.
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:53.388]   Their hatred of themselves is so complete That they are willing to watch the entire world burn in order to quell their feelings of inadequacy of themselves because of other people.
[02:24:53.988 --> 02:24:57.369]  So, in other words, if you look at the Bible, it's an interesting story.
[02:24:57.689 --> 02:25:02.291]  Cain and Abel, right, two brothers, they both bring offerings to God.
[02:25:02.651 --> 02:25:04.791]  God chooses Abel's offering and not Cain's, right?
[02:25:04.811 --> 02:25:06.732]  So, God set up a dominance hierarchy.
[02:25:07.128 --> 02:25:08.809]  We're not all equal, are we?
[02:25:08.829 --> 02:25:10.230]  So Cain got upset, right?
[02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:13.972]  So what did God do?
[02:25:14.012 --> 02:25:15.673]  He came to him and said, why are you depressed?
[02:25:16.014 --> 02:25:18.675]  Improve yourself and I'll take your offering as well.
[02:25:18.715 --> 02:25:19.296]  What did he do?
[02:25:19.556 --> 02:25:20.476]  He killed the competition.
[02:25:20.516 --> 02:25:21.217]  He killed his brother.
[02:25:21.517 --> 02:25:22.798]  That's human history in a nutshell.
[02:25:23.405 --> 02:25:33.491]  Now there's another, instead of taking personal responsibility for your own character flaws, your own inadequacies, if something went wrong in your life, look inside yourself and improve yourself.
[02:25:33.911 --> 02:25:43.617]  Rather, it's much easier to blame the other person who is doing well, and is working hard, and is putting in the honest effort, because that person makes you look inadequate.
[02:25:44.077 --> 02:25:45.678]  Instead of working on yourself, you kill him.
[02:25:46.339 --> 02:25:47.759]  That's history in a nutshell.
[02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:48.740]  That's Bill Gates.
[02:25:51.522 --> 02:26:00.705]  I really think that we do need military tribunals where these animals are brought to justice and there should be a trial.
[02:26:01.405 --> 02:26:11.548]  And once they're found guilty of capital murder, crimes against humanity, genocidal crimes, they should be hung or shot or executed.
[02:26:11.707 --> 02:26:17.707]   and their corpses should be left as an example for future aspiring despots and wannabe
[02:26:17.707 --> 02:26:21.226]  tyrants that this is going to happen to you as well.
[02:26:21.226 --> 02:26:28.266]   I agree with you that historically tyrants have lost over and over again so that now they've got
[02:26:28.266 --> 02:26:34.266]   this sophisticated hidden plan and I agree they need to know that humanity is getting on a war
[02:26:35.041 --> 02:26:35.861]  I think they know that.
[02:26:35.881 --> 02:26:39.864]  I mean, I think their plan was going well at first, but that's how all these big conquests go.
[02:26:40.204 --> 02:26:50.353]   But the deeper they get in, the more they push, and the fact that People now know that long before the shots even started, we all predicted you and others could see that they would then blame the unvaccinated.
[02:26:50.673 --> 02:26:54.917]  More and more people aren't buying this, and it doesn't look like the censorship is working like they thought.
[02:26:55.278 --> 02:27:04.186]  If you had to score this as a macabre football game or sporting event or boxing match with 12 rounds, where would you say the forces of pro-humanity, pro-God are?
[02:27:04.827 --> 02:27:10.852]  Versus the forces like the governor of New York that says, I'm God, you're my disciples, God tells me what to do.
[02:27:10.892 --> 02:27:13.374]  If you don't do what I say, you're against God.
[02:27:13.414 --> 02:27:14.815]  I mean, how do we fight this cult?
[02:27:17.217 --> 02:27:17.878]  By destroying it.
[02:27:18.779 --> 02:27:30.409]  And you destroy it by first adhering to principles of truth, of self-refinement, and accepting monotheism, and realizing that it requires a little humility.
[02:27:30.449 --> 02:27:31.670]  No one has God in their pocket.
[02:27:32.130 --> 02:27:34.979]   No one could say, I know what God wants.
[02:27:35.619 --> 02:27:41.541]  No religion, no... Whenever I hear any institution say, I know exactly what God wants, I always stay away from them.
[02:27:42.041 --> 02:27:44.142]  We could say, I think that this is what God wants.
[02:27:45.103 --> 02:27:49.605]  I'm not God's accountant, I don't know for sure, but we could say... It's very blasphemous.
[02:27:49.645 --> 02:27:52.246]  Anybody saying they know what God wants, they're saying they're God.
[02:27:52.266 --> 02:27:54.006]  I mean, they're saying, listen to me, I'm God.
[02:27:55.967 --> 02:27:56.167]  Yeah.
[02:27:56.587 --> 02:27:59.789]  So, you know, Pharoah from...
[02:28:01.199 --> 02:28:06.939]   uh... and uh... bible used to uh... i don't think that he was a human being by going to
[02:28:06.939 --> 02:28:10.279]   dedicate by the mountain river early in the morning so people wouldn't
[02:28:10.279 --> 02:28:11.699]   see him dedicated
[02:28:11.699 --> 02:28:16.739]   because he wanted to know the god of illusion so that's that's all that's what i was trying to
[02:28:16.739 --> 02:28:22.659]   i hear so-called humanity and appears it was the same taking six seven showers a day and
[02:28:22.659 --> 02:28:29.259]   sneaking up to go to the bathroom that's a fact when we see that a lot don't we were these types
[02:28:29.259 --> 02:28:36.098]   i mean these are are perversion to the ultimate extreme.
[02:28:36.024 --> 02:28:38.865]  Because what is the opposite of perversion?
[02:28:39.506 --> 02:28:50.732]  Which is to align all your drives and all your God-given gifts with the will of God, including sex, including the lust for power.
[02:28:50.752 --> 02:28:55.695]  All that could be sublimated and used in a divine purpose.
[02:28:55.755 --> 02:29:03.231]   What real perversion is, is people taking their base qualities and refusing to refine them and using them as an
[02:29:03.231 --> 02:29:09.820]   instrument of evil, of getting their name known over that of the name of God. See, I don't care
[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:15.341]   if the world knows my name or not, it's not about me. I wouldn't mind if God's name is sanctified
[02:29:15.341 --> 02:29:20.050]   because of perhaps my life, but it's not about me at all. Actually, the more I get
[02:29:20.050 --> 02:29:27.441]   myself out of the picture, the more useful and effective I become. So that's the difference between a
[02:29:27.441 --> 02:29:33.601]   true spiritual, let's say, healthy approach, a leader, versus a cult leader. Because a true
[02:29:33.601 --> 02:29:38.251]   spiritual leader, what he tries to do, or she tries to do, is connect you to God by getting
[02:29:38.251 --> 02:29:39.871]  themselves out of the way.
[02:29:39.871 --> 02:29:46.671]   There's nothing more pleasurable for a true leader to see his students prosper without
[02:29:46.671 --> 02:29:50.591]  the leader's influence. Absolutely.
[02:29:50.794 --> 02:29:52.556]  I want my students to become leaders.
[02:29:52.696 --> 02:29:55.218]  I want my children to become leaders.
[02:29:55.238 --> 02:29:56.479]  And then take care of us later.
[02:29:56.519 --> 02:29:59.822]  That's what we're supposed to do, is empower the next generation to take care of us.
[02:29:59.922 --> 02:30:01.684]  They do the same and we have a family.
[02:30:01.704 --> 02:30:05.508]  You know, I saw a t-shirt, be nice to your kids, they choose your nursing home.
[02:30:06.248 --> 02:30:26.358]   But the despots and the cultists amongst us What they like to do is not connect you to or free you so that your soul becomes a free-flying birdie and is able to connect to the Creator without them, but rather make you co-dependent on them for everything.
[02:30:29.399 --> 02:30:30.740]  And that's what we're seeing happening now.
[02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:36.823]  It's a fight between two mentalities, two systems that can't coexist.
[02:30:37.303 --> 02:30:47.272]   There's the God mentality, there's the drive within us to live in a God-consciousness way and And to experience true freedom?
[02:30:48.752 --> 02:30:55.914]  Because when you put on the yoke of heaven, you take off the yoke of your own insecurities, your own inadequacies, and that of the opinions of other people.
[02:30:55.994 --> 02:30:56.494]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:30:56.514 --> 02:31:02.295]  The more I align myself with God and make myself get out of the way, the freer I am, and the more I understand.
[02:31:02.355 --> 02:31:03.476]  It's like, this is ridiculous.
[02:31:03.776 --> 02:31:05.216]  Why don't the Satanists know this?
[02:31:05.256 --> 02:31:08.417]  The power and the freedom of getting aligned with God is incredible.
[02:31:09.701 --> 02:31:20.151]  There's a saying, I don't know if I thought of it, but it makes sense to me, that there's only one type of free person in the world, and that's someone who chooses, the operative word here is chooses, to be a slave to God.
[02:31:22.513 --> 02:31:23.013]  Absolutely.
[02:31:24.755 --> 02:31:28.719]  Whereas Satan, the serpent, tricks you into it, thinking you're going to be God, you become a slave.
[02:31:32.191 --> 02:31:36.110]  That's the interesting nuance, the irony of it.
[02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:37.891]  Alright, final segment, this is amazing.
[02:31:37.891 --> 02:31:42.331]   I want to come back to the Joe Rogan clip, and I want to tell people about ZStackLife.com.
[02:31:42.331 --> 02:31:45.271]   This is something the big brother of them will let you know about, and I'm 100% behind it.
[02:31:45.271 --> 02:31:49.090]  ZStackLife.com, Alex Jones, stay with us.
[02:31:49.090 --> 02:31:54.931]   I've always had a sixth sense for danger, and as I've gotten older, it's gotten stronger,
[02:31:54.931 --> 02:32:01.550]   and I pay attention to it, but now it's a thousand times what it's ever been.
[02:32:00.549 --> 02:32:06.992]  I use the Lord of the Rings analogy when Bilbo Baggins has that elf sword, when goblins are near, it starts shining blue.
[02:32:07.012 --> 02:32:23.718]   Well, it's white-hot blue right now, and you can see it all, and a lot of people subconsciously, I believe, know this is bad, know they're being attacked, and so they internalize that fear and aren't sure why, but then consciously, under Stockholm syndrome, mass Stockholm syndrome, bow down
[02:32:23.718 --> 02:32:31.027]   to their abusers even though deep down they know the truth. And then they also demonize people
[02:32:31.027 --> 02:32:36.236]   like Dr. Bartlett where they've been attacking nationwide.
[02:32:36.421 --> 02:32:47.526]  Howard Stern attacked him and saying, oh, he's just doing that for money when he recommends a online pharmacy site that he has nothing to do with so people can get Ivermectin and Budesonide and things.
[02:32:47.806 --> 02:32:49.687]  That's evil, but I'm of this thought.
[02:32:50.367 --> 02:32:53.550]  I'm like, why doesn't Dr. Bartlett write a book and become more successful?
[02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:55.151]  He's already advisor to multiple governors.
[02:32:56.332 --> 02:33:00.215]  Why are we ashamed that we have businesses and we help people and we sell good products?
[02:33:00.776 --> 02:33:05.620]  I want somebody that sells good cars, good medicine, good food, good clothing.
[02:33:05.780 --> 02:33:09.863]  But you see, then, oh, good people, we're not supposed to even have our thing in the marketplace of ideas.
[02:33:10.464 --> 02:33:14.968]  So I'm really glad that Dr. Zelenko doesn't let the system intimidate him.
[02:33:15.008 --> 02:33:17.190]  And he did this really out of need because nobody else was doing it.
[02:33:17.690 --> 02:33:18.291]  He came out.
[02:33:19.031 --> 02:33:24.631]   with the Z-Stack. It's a specifically formulated supplement that includes zinc, quercetin, vitamin C,
[02:33:24.631 --> 02:33:28.470]   and vitamin D. And quercetin, again, does the same thing as those dreaded things that the
[02:33:28.470 --> 02:33:33.351]   system's been attacking. Formulated by Dr. Vladimir Dyslenko, the world-renowned doctor
[02:33:33.351 --> 02:33:37.750]   that President Trump credited with his successful early treatment protocol, his decision to take
[02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:42.951]   hydroxychloroquine. And he reached out to us and said, "Hey, would you like to do an affiliate
[02:33:43.430 --> 02:33:44.190]  And it's been great.
[02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:45.191]  Listeners are checking it out.
[02:33:45.271 --> 02:33:46.292]  It is a great product.

[02:33:48.553 --> 02:33:49.614]  And I think everybody should get it.
[02:33:50.114 --> 02:33:50.995]  You should stockpile it.
[02:33:51.015 --> 02:33:54.617]  You should share it with family that doesn't know what's going on, because this is good for your health, period.

[02:34:04.884 --> 02:34:07.485]   But regardless, Get prepared, get ready.
[02:34:07.505 --> 02:34:10.546]  And that's my next question up for you, doctor.
[02:34:11.486 --> 02:34:23.828]  With all these people with the blood clots and all the rest of it and the heart attacks increasing and the antibody enhancement syndrome and all this, a lot of people call me, not a lot, tons call me and email me and ask me on the street.
[02:34:24.348 --> 02:34:27.129]  Ask next time Zalinko's on or one of those other great doctors.
[02:34:27.949 --> 02:34:29.349]  I took the shot or my wife did.
[02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:30.089]  We didn't know.
[02:34:30.210 --> 02:34:30.990]  What do we do?
[02:34:31.310 --> 02:34:50.591]   And I know you can't I think the answer is yes to everything you just said, but there are tactics that will help somewhat, and it depends on where you are after the shot.
[02:34:50.611 --> 02:34:56.973]  Within the first three months, the main threat to your life is blood clots, but obviously it would make sense to take blood thinners.
[02:34:58.127 --> 02:35:07.656]  During that period of time, so either aspirin or the more advanced blood thinners, especially if you have a blood clotting predisposition or you're pregnant.
[02:35:08.757 --> 02:35:15.422]  But that risk of blood clots fades after three months, and I know that because we're not really seeing blood clots after three months.
[02:35:15.783 --> 02:35:17.464]  We're seeing other problems, but not blood clots.
[02:35:18.065 --> 02:35:22.529]  Now, the antibody enhancement concern is a real concern.
[02:35:24.426 --> 02:35:26.928]  But there is a way to deal with it, I think, intelligently.
[02:35:27.489 --> 02:35:34.775]  And just because someone has a bomb inside them, and that's exactly what you have if you took the shot, you've made bomb antibodies that are in you.
[02:35:35.135 --> 02:35:36.676]  But it doesn't mean that they have to detonate.
[02:35:37.177 --> 02:35:45.003]  And if you understand the triggers of the detonation, you can have strategies to avoid setting off your bombs.
[02:35:45.083 --> 02:35:49.587]  And one obvious answer is don't make any more bombs.
[02:35:50.167 --> 02:35:51.468]  In other words, don't take any more shots.
[02:35:51.488 --> 02:35:52.189]  Don't take boosters.
[02:35:52.788 --> 02:35:54.570]  If you made a mistake once, don't do it twice.
[02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:55.971]  I mean, that's obvious.
[02:35:57.052 --> 02:36:14.390]  But besides that, if you already have those bombs in you, then you have to understand that it's another viral infection of similar, similar enough to the antibodies that you have, that if those antibodies recognize that virus and they come together, sets off a nuclear reaction that kills you.
[02:36:15.117 --> 02:36:18.939]  And so the only way to avoid that is not to get another viral infection.
[02:36:19.479 --> 02:36:20.900]  So you can ask me, well, how are you going to do that?
[02:36:21.180 --> 02:36:23.041]  Well, again, the answer is don't take another shot.
[02:36:23.061 --> 02:36:23.921]  It's not going to help you.
[02:36:24.421 --> 02:36:26.922]  What you really need to do is take prophylaxis or prevention.
[02:36:26.942 --> 02:36:37.547]  In other words, if I have a 10-year-old patient that got the shot, that 10-year-old patient, in my mind, has the same risk of dying as a 95-year-old nursing home resident.
[02:36:39.628 --> 02:36:51.784]   And so I would treat that 10-year-old in an aggressive prophylactic way in order to prevent them from getting another viral infection of similar etiology.
[02:36:52.624 --> 02:36:59.970]  Or if they do get it, I would treat them aggressively, extremely early, not to let those antibodies destroy the person.
[02:37:00.330 --> 02:37:12.038]  We do this all the time with Strep A. Strep A is always treated with antibiotics because if the immune system treats Strep A, it also attacks the hearts of children, causing rheumatic fever, so heart disease.
[02:37:12.098 --> 02:37:17.912]   So in order to protect the hearts of children, We don't want your immune reaction to take care of it.
[02:37:17.972 --> 02:37:26.137]  We want antibiotics to take care of it in the context of Strep A. And the same concept comes to these viral infections.
[02:37:26.577 --> 02:37:32.148]   I do not want your immune system to trigger its pathologic Antibodies can kill you.
[02:37:32.387 --> 02:37:35.746]   I'd rather use antiviral drugs to prevent you from getting it.
[02:37:35.746 --> 02:37:40.746]   So I mean I'm a lay person but that's what I just said on air myself is if this vaccine
[02:37:40.746 --> 02:37:44.226]   basically creates a spike protein similar to the virus and we're worried about that
[02:37:44.226 --> 02:37:46.986]   well you don't want to come in contact with new viruses that's what could trigger this
[02:37:46.986 --> 02:37:50.867]   you don't want to be able to replicate so the answer is everything that's already healthy
[02:37:50.867 --> 02:37:56.226]   that's essential vitamin D, zinc, all those type of things, sunshine, air, clean water,
[02:37:56.226 --> 02:38:01.947]   washing your hands, all of that would then contribute to you not detonating the bomb.
[02:38:01.947 --> 02:38:06.066]   Well having a healthy immune system, having a good bulletproof vest is important but it's
[02:38:06.066 --> 02:38:10.146]   also important not to get shot in the head and take proper precaution.
[02:38:10.116 --> 02:38:14.537]  And to have the right machine gun also, that if the enemy comes near you, you destroy it.
[02:38:15.137 --> 02:38:18.337]  So it's a multifaceted approach to stay alive.
[02:38:18.858 --> 02:38:24.159]  But the key, by the way, it's not the spike proteins that do the harm over time.
[02:38:24.579 --> 02:38:27.739]  The spike proteins will fade after three to six months.
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:32.037]   The concern is the antibodies produced Because of the spike proteins.
[02:38:32.738 --> 02:38:40.364]  You see, those spike proteins trigger the immune response that make the antibodies that sit in you forever and do the damage.
[02:38:40.605 --> 02:38:43.327]  So the next time you come in contact with a virus or what is it then?
[02:38:44.308 --> 02:38:44.788]  That's right.
[02:38:45.189 --> 02:38:47.851]  Next time you come, let's go back to 1960.
[02:38:47.931 --> 02:38:49.452]  We gave kids RSV vaccine.
[02:38:49.692 --> 02:38:51.334]  They made RSV antibodies.
[02:38:51.854 --> 02:38:55.918]  Then when the kids met RSV virus in the world, they died.
[02:38:57.438 --> 02:39:00.078]  So it's the vital trigger.
[02:39:00.078 --> 02:39:01.598]  Well, here's my next question.
[02:39:01.598 --> 02:39:04.678]   And I've got a meeting I got to at three, but let's just do the final segment.
[02:39:04.678 --> 02:39:05.598]  This is too important.
[02:39:05.598 --> 02:39:07.758]  We got three minutes to break.
[02:39:07.758 --> 02:39:10.478]   From other daughters I've talked to and people that have predicted what's coming next--
[02:39:10.478 --> 02:39:11.957]  and I think you said similar things.
[02:39:11.957 --> 02:39:14.477]  I don't want to put words in your mouth.
[02:39:13.424 --> 02:39:17.066]  How are they going to cover up the antibody enhancement syndrome?
[02:39:17.366 --> 02:39:18.647]  What are they going to blame that on?
[02:39:18.667 --> 02:39:29.694]  Obviously they planned all this out, so thinking logically like Sherlock Holmes would do or Dr. Zelenko would do, how are they going to cover up this mass die-off that's obviously coming and we already see a lot of death happening.
[02:39:29.714 --> 02:39:30.494]  How are they going to do that?
[02:39:31.495 --> 02:39:33.556]  They're going to blame you and me because we didn't take the vaccine.
[02:39:36.042 --> 02:39:39.324]  We're the ones that are spreading the infection.
[02:39:39.625 --> 02:39:40.305]  So, a few questions.
[02:39:40.385 --> 02:39:43.167]  First of all, if you're vaccinated, why are you afraid of the virus?
[02:39:43.387 --> 02:39:44.208]  You're vaccinated, right?
[02:39:44.788 --> 02:39:45.488]  So, number one.
[02:39:45.508 --> 02:39:51.372]  Number two, can you tell me why vaccinated people have higher levels of virus when we check them than unvaccinated?
[02:39:51.693 --> 02:40:05.722]  And the answer is, it's the vaccinated people themselves that are much more prone to getting infections, much more prone in spreading infections, and they're the source of evolutionary pressure to make more strains and more lethal strains.
[02:40:06.636 --> 02:40:13.440]  So it's the vaccinated population that is the driving force for the upcoming death.
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:28.488]  Doctor, I know it's premeditated, I read the document, so have you, but you're right, it's still a gamble, not the vaccine, but a gamble doing this to us, because the wheels are coming off, people are finding out, they may have dumbed down people that don't see it, but anybody that's even halfway smart is going to see what's going on.
[02:40:28.749 --> 02:40:30.329]  How the hell are they going to get away with this?
[02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:31.750]  The answer is no, right?
[02:40:33.511 --> 02:40:36.253]  I hope they get away by being swung in a rope at the head.
[02:40:38.817 --> 02:40:45.164]  But I guess it just goes, we try to project intelligence onto really evil people, and some do have it, but isn't it really, like you said, it's a desire, like a hunger.
[02:40:45.424 --> 02:40:47.906]  They want to do this because they're jealous of free people.
[02:40:49.928 --> 02:40:59.859]  Yeah, they somehow think that their lives will be better when there's less people in the world, and they have some artificial sense of power over robots and slaves.
[02:41:01.135 --> 02:41:01.475]  That's it.
[02:41:01.555 --> 02:41:04.577]  You've absolutely nailed it, unlike any other guest we've got.
[02:41:04.597 --> 02:41:06.418]  And I'm not kissing your rear end here, Doc.
[02:41:06.478 --> 02:41:06.858]  It's true.
[02:41:06.878 --> 02:41:08.038]  You know what you're talking about.
[02:41:08.058 --> 02:41:10.459]  People can get your great product at ZStackLife.com.
[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:14.882]  It's all the great essential stuff for your body and has the corset in it.
[02:41:15.162 --> 02:41:17.343]  So get it at ZStackLife.com forward slash Alex.
[02:41:17.663 --> 02:41:22.845]  You know, 10 years ago, I played happy country music and rock and roll and folk stuff here on there because I was a happy guy.
[02:41:22.865 --> 02:41:24.286]  Oh, we were going to beat the globalists.
[02:41:24.306 --> 02:41:25.447]  They'd never actually pull the trigger.
[02:41:26.207 --> 02:41:32.030]  Now I play epic operatic music because it's the only thing fits just how much trouble we're in.
[02:41:32.050 --> 02:41:35.232]  But as Dr. Zelenko said, it's the big test of humanity.
[02:41:35.272 --> 02:41:41.616]  So in closing, sir, you've said a lot of powerful stuff about being on a war footing and where we are, but in closing, how do we turn this around?
[02:41:41.656 --> 02:41:42.597]  How do we push this back?
[02:41:42.897 --> 02:41:48.020]  How do we make sure that before billions are dead, we're able to start reversing this and bring these criminals to justice?
[02:41:49.421 --> 02:41:57.778]   Well, we need like-minded generals like Joe Rogan and people that have platforms like him That could broadcast the truth.
[02:41:57.838 --> 02:42:03.164]  I mean, these are independent thinkers, heroes, inspirations of mine, actually, in many ways.
[02:42:03.725 --> 02:42:13.636]  And I really hope that they think carefully through the narrative and look through the facts and then use their beautiful platforms to inform the public.
[02:42:14.076 --> 02:42:15.277]  Because that's the key here.
[02:42:15.297 --> 02:42:16.478]  This is an information war.
[02:42:16.758 --> 02:42:17.879]  This is a narrative war.
[02:42:18.019 --> 02:42:21.541]  The enemies of humanity have used... And Doc, this is too important.
[02:42:21.561 --> 02:42:25.424]  As much as I love your dog, I want to get this out because this is powerful.
[02:42:25.484 --> 02:42:27.405]  I'm going to make a promo video with this.
[02:42:27.425 --> 02:42:29.086]  So, what type of dog do you have?
[02:42:29.106 --> 02:42:29.767]  I love dogs too.
[02:42:31.169 --> 02:42:31.930]  I have a golden doodle.
[02:42:32.010 --> 02:42:34.131]  Should I bring him in or out, and what should I do?
[02:42:34.351 --> 02:42:36.892]  Do whatever you like, but I want you to be able to restart and recap what you were just saying.
[02:42:36.932 --> 02:42:37.333]  Yeah, be sure.
[02:42:37.393 --> 02:42:38.934]  Take a minute and put the Labradoodle away.
[02:42:38.974 --> 02:42:39.954]  He loves Daddy, we know that.
[02:42:39.974 --> 02:42:45.958]  Because I want to be able to start over what he was saying about Joe, because Doc doesn't know it, but I was asking him that question.
[02:42:47.138 --> 02:42:48.659]  Well, I guess he probably can figure it out.
[02:42:48.679 --> 02:42:50.200]  I just told him I'm doing a promo.
[02:42:50.780 --> 02:42:51.541]  So here we go.
[02:42:51.601 --> 02:42:52.922]  Oh my God, I love Labradoodles.
[02:42:53.916 --> 02:42:57.398]  See, my French Bulldog, there it is, my French Bulldog died a few years ago.
[02:42:57.418 --> 02:43:00.400]  He was 12, and then me and my wife have been arguing about what type of dog to get.
[02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:02.161]  I think we're settling on a Labradoodle.
[02:43:02.741 --> 02:43:03.661]  Wow, Doc, that's awesome.
[02:43:03.681 --> 02:43:04.462]  What's your dog's name?
[02:43:05.883 --> 02:43:07.183]  Mishka means teddy bear in Russian.
[02:43:07.864 --> 02:43:08.624]  Aww, Mishka.
[02:43:09.485 --> 02:43:10.105]  So cute.
[02:43:10.966 --> 02:43:14.007]  He's a good prop.
[02:43:14.027 --> 02:43:16.489]  Go ahead and start over, Doc, with what you were saying about what we need to do.
[02:43:16.909 --> 02:43:17.409]  That was key.
[02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:19.931]  Listen, we need generals.
[02:43:21.223 --> 02:43:34.812]  We need people with platforms like Joe Rogan and other people like that who are free-thinking spirits, who don't buy into the false narrative, and are able to kind of dig out the truth themselves, and they have the trust of the people.
[02:43:35.752 --> 02:43:36.713]  So this is the key here.
[02:43:36.753 --> 02:43:37.894]  This is a narrative war.
[02:43:38.434 --> 02:43:41.416]  The enemies of humanity have control over the social media.
[02:43:42.137 --> 02:43:45.499]  They have a head start, social media and mainstream media, but we can catch up.
[02:43:45.579 --> 02:44:07.463]   And a little truth, a little light, Dispenses a lot of darkness, so I plead on people like Joe and Rogan and other people with platforms to wake up, join coalesce together as an army of truth speakers and say no to these animals and these despots and save as many people as we can with spreading the truth.
[02:44:08.543 --> 02:44:11.325]  Humanity, the soul of humanity is at stake here.
[02:44:11.954 --> 02:44:14.395]  It's time to wake up, and it's time to rise up.
[02:44:14.735 --> 02:44:15.675]  Don't be complacent.
[02:44:15.755 --> 02:44:16.975]  This is World War III.
[02:44:17.515 --> 02:44:19.176]  This is the call of our generation.
[02:44:20.636 --> 02:44:39.680]  And I promise you, at the end of your days, when you're lying, when Rogan's lying on his deathbed when he's 120, and he realizes that this platform was used to spread the truth to millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people, that will be a good, good thing for him in his relationship with God, and for all of us.
[02:44:42.423 --> 02:44:44.023]  Beautifully said, Dr. Zelenko.
[02:44:44.083 --> 02:44:47.224]  Thank you so much, and God bless you, and we really appreciate you.
[02:44:47.264 --> 02:44:51.105]  Anytime you come back on to keep chronicling things, please join us.
[02:44:51.365 --> 02:44:52.085]  Have a great weekend.
[02:44:53.125 --> 02:44:53.546]  God bless you.
[02:44:53.606 --> 02:44:53.906]  Thank you.
[02:44:54.086 --> 02:44:54.526]  God bless you.
[02:44:54.546 --> 02:45:00.247]  Well, that was extremely powerful, and I was going to play a clip of some of these NBA players who are, like, more eloquent than I am.
[02:45:01.307 --> 02:45:07.729]  In fact, some of these NBA players are, like, one of these guys is, like, the most eloquent person I've ever heard speak on these shots and what's happening.
[02:45:08.869 --> 02:45:09.610]  I was going to get to that.
[02:45:09.630 --> 02:45:10.951]  We already played some a few days ago.
[02:45:10.971 --> 02:45:12.132]  There's more coming out.
[02:45:12.573 --> 02:45:13.193]  There's more.
[02:45:13.213 --> 02:45:17.037]  And I'm like, wow, these are definitely leaders we need.
[02:45:18.358 --> 02:45:19.500]  These should be senators.
[02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:20.400]  These should be presidents.
[02:45:20.420 --> 02:45:24.625]  Not because they're black, but because the way they lay it out is the best I've heard.
[02:45:25.365 --> 02:45:28.749]  So we've got Owen Schroeder about to take over in the war room.
[02:45:30.225 --> 02:45:35.647]  I'm going to come in here tomorrow with Dr. Fleming, who's going to be in studio with us doing a whole presentation.
[02:45:35.707 --> 02:45:40.408]  He's got all the documentation on how they're killing us and how it's premeditated and where it's all going and how to stop them.
[02:45:40.468 --> 02:45:43.369]  So we're going to be shooting from like 11 to 3 tomorrow.
[02:45:44.570 --> 02:45:45.950]  I look forward to air at 5 or so.
[02:45:46.571 --> 02:45:48.311]  Some people get mad when the Saturday shows don't happen at 5.
[02:45:48.351 --> 02:45:50.612]  Hey, it's a skeleton crew.
[02:45:52.346 --> 02:45:53.266]  We're doing it on our own, then.
[02:45:54.027 --> 02:45:57.228]  And, you know, by that we don't have, like, the satellites and all the other stuff.
[02:45:58.508 --> 02:46:05.071]  And so we're going to have him in studio, and it's going to be powerful, and I'm going to shoot some special reports tomorrow as well.
[02:46:05.091 --> 02:46:11.814]   But I got to tell you, everything Zelenko said today was even more powerful than usual, and we need to take This information turned into promos.
[02:46:12.734 --> 02:46:13.854]  We need to get it out.
[02:46:14.034 --> 02:46:15.995]  All of you that are taking clips out of the show, you know you are.
[02:46:16.375 --> 02:46:16.855]  Great job.
[02:46:16.875 --> 02:46:17.856]  The crew's doing a great job.
[02:46:18.396 --> 02:46:22.878]  And as long as I cannot get over-reved and over-focused here, we're going to win this thing.
[02:46:23.398 --> 02:46:26.279]  And yes, it's going to be rough, but it's going to get rough anyway.
[02:46:26.859 --> 02:46:33.019]   So you might as well just not lay down and let them Chew your guts out at their leisure, but give them one hell of a fight.
[02:46:33.179 --> 02:46:40.661]  And it's that process that's going to bring us into the future, spiritually and on the third dimension for our children and their children.
[02:46:42.122 --> 02:46:50.725]  But yes, I've had to come to grips with the fact that people have asked me with the news you've seen out there about default judgments and all this stuff and like, oh, how are you taking it?
[02:46:51.025 --> 02:46:51.925]  They want to shut you down.
[02:46:51.965 --> 02:46:53.005]  You don't get a jury trial.
[02:46:54.246 --> 02:46:57.647]  They're already injected millions of people with something that's designed to slowly kill them.
[02:46:59.383 --> 02:47:02.889]  I mean, I use the Star Trek, Ratatouille con thing, because that's one of the better Star Treks.
[02:47:02.929 --> 02:47:04.311]  I don't like most Star Trek, but I like that one.
[02:47:04.492 --> 02:47:05.634]  I like some of the old 60s movies.
[02:47:05.654 --> 02:47:06.696]  Those are, you know, TV shows.
[02:47:06.736 --> 02:47:09.220]  I like the vintage stuff for comedy stuff.
[02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:11.043]  I love Captain Kirk, William Shatner, but...
[02:47:12.005 --> 02:47:17.569]  We're at the con where Spock knows that when the bomb goes off, it's going to blow up the ship, that their engines are out.
[02:47:18.210 --> 02:47:20.912]  And so he goes down there and kills himself to save everybody.
[02:47:21.372 --> 02:47:22.733]  Somebody's got to go in there and do it.
[02:47:22.793 --> 02:47:24.495]  And I'm not like Mr. Hero doing that.
[02:47:24.835 --> 02:47:27.257]  I'm not going to watch my kids sit there and get fed on by this.
[02:47:27.277 --> 02:47:33.321]  I'm not going to just roll over to this and then watch all these other men sit there and do nothing while this happens.
[02:47:33.341 --> 02:47:36.124]  I mean, I always thought I would go get other men to wake up and take action.
[02:47:36.764 --> 02:47:38.146]  And that's happened to a certain extent.
[02:47:38.507 --> 02:47:41.452]  But then more and more I get pushed in a leadership position, which I don't even want.
[02:47:42.133 --> 02:47:42.874]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:47:44.116 --> 02:47:44.857]  I'm not backing down.
[02:47:44.877 --> 02:47:45.599]  I'm not shutting up.
[02:47:45.639 --> 02:47:50.707]  In fact, I'm stronger with all these attacks and these lies and the horrible things they've done to me that I won't even tell you on air.
[02:47:51.618 --> 02:47:52.299]  But it's painful.
[02:47:52.819 --> 02:47:56.542]  But man, those wounds literally took me up multiple levels.
[02:47:57.102 --> 02:47:58.963]  And I've got God's plan now.
[02:47:59.023 --> 02:48:01.525]  I've got a lot bigger eyeball on it than I used to.
[02:48:01.545 --> 02:48:06.249]  I always loved God, but now I've got a lot bigger understanding of it, and I just want to know more.
[02:48:06.749 --> 02:48:07.990]  But I also am fleshly.
[02:48:08.110 --> 02:48:19.498]  I don't like pain, and I don't like bad things happening, and I don't like physical things happening, and I don't like, you know, the horrible persecution that goes on against my family and things.
[02:48:20.663 --> 02:48:22.585]  That's okay because somebody's got to stand up against these people.
[02:48:22.825 --> 02:48:29.290]  And I know you as an audience of activists, you burn with that same desire for justice as I do and I love you and I want to thank you.
[02:48:30.384 --> 02:48:39.752]  For keeping us in attack formation, for keeping us on the attack against these bullies and this scum, and that they fear us and they hate us and they don't know what to do because we love God.
[02:48:40.112 --> 02:48:41.994]  So I don't attack these people because I hate them.
[02:48:42.894 --> 02:48:44.596]  I fight them because I love my family.
[02:48:44.616 --> 02:48:56.508]   You know, to paraphrase the famous philosopher that said, we don't fight for the evil in front of us, we don't fight because we hate it, we fight because those of us That understand it, know that we have to fight for our children and others behind us.
[02:48:56.548 --> 02:48:58.631]  So we don't fight because of who we hate in front of us.
[02:48:59.032 --> 02:49:00.815]  We fight for those we love behind us.
[02:49:02.264 --> 02:49:03.125]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:49:03.165 --> 02:49:11.591]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com, get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get our great sleep aid that's now back in stock, 50% off, down and out.
[02:49:11.911 --> 02:49:14.813]  It's even stronger than knockout, but it's in stock too, 50% off.
[02:49:15.334 --> 02:49:22.259]  And we've got all these other great products like the greens capsules from Sprouts that are so good for your body, so many vitamins and minerals, but also clean out your guts.
[02:49:22.319 --> 02:49:24.060]  It's going to sell out in a couple days.
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:28.744]  It's still 50% off, and that's what allows our operation to stay on air.
[02:49:28.784 --> 02:49:36.297]   But the most important thing, Is to continue to pray for the broadcast and to spread the word about the broadcast, because that's the key currency I'm after.
[02:49:37.118 --> 02:49:40.181]  Is to reach new people and to reach out to new folks, and you've changed the world doing it.
[02:49:40.521 --> 02:49:47.488]  You are the hardcore brigades of men, women, and children, every race, color, and creed, who are one race with red blood that love God, fighting these monsters.
[02:49:47.508 --> 02:49:49.129]  So we're gonna end the transmission.
[02:49:50.146 --> 02:49:52.988]  And play this Joe Rogan piece with the swearing cutout.
[02:49:53.008 --> 02:49:56.311]  It's not as powerful, but that's posted on his Instagram if you want to see it and share it.
[02:49:57.492 --> 02:49:59.073]  And this is the American way.
[02:49:59.113 --> 02:50:00.054]  This is what it's all about.
[02:50:00.675 --> 02:50:04.818]  And we've got Joe to come, you know, almost completely into the light now.
[02:50:05.118 --> 02:50:07.420]  And others are as well because they see how real this is.
[02:50:07.821 --> 02:50:09.462]  And they have the courage to fight.
[02:50:10.222 --> 02:50:11.003]  And so it's on.
[02:50:11.083 --> 02:50:12.424]  So thank you all for what you've done.
[02:50:12.464 --> 02:50:13.345]  You've changed the world.
[02:50:13.946 --> 02:50:15.787]  And the fight against tyranny has just begun.
[02:50:15.827 --> 02:50:16.768]  Here's the Joe Rogan piece.
[02:50:18.464 --> 02:50:36.495]   As soon as you give politicians power, any kind of power that didn't exist previously, If they can figure out a way to force you into carrying something that lets you enter businesses, or lets you do this, or lets businesses open, historically, they are not going to give that power up.
[02:50:36.615 --> 02:50:39.455]  They find new reasons to use it.
[02:50:39.655 --> 02:50:47.517]  We have to protect those freedoms at all costs, whether you agree with people's choices or not, because it is the foundation that this country was founded on.
[02:50:47.777 --> 02:50:48.177]  Freedom.
[02:50:49.841 --> 02:50:50.922]  This idea of freedom.
[02:50:51.222 --> 02:50:53.564]  There's so many people that think it's frivolous.
[02:50:53.644 --> 02:50:54.604]  It's not important.
[02:50:54.664 --> 02:50:57.526]  It's not the main thing that we should be focused on.
[02:50:57.567 --> 02:51:02.150]  But it is the literal structure that allows this country to be so fucking amazing.
[02:51:03.070 --> 02:51:15.562]   Every single country that's ever existed other than the United States Up until 1776, every fucking country that has ever existed was run by dictators.
[02:51:15.783 --> 02:51:16.263]  All of them.
[02:51:16.443 --> 02:51:22.490]  This is the first experiment in self-government that actually worked, and it created the greatest superpower the world's ever known.
[02:51:23.151 --> 02:51:30.315]  This is the greatest cultural machine, the greatest machine of art and creativity and innovation, right fucking here.
[02:51:30.575 --> 02:51:31.375]  And how did it do that?
[02:51:31.636 --> 02:51:32.416]  It did it through freedom.
[02:51:32.816 --> 02:51:40.180]  And as soon as you see something, anything, that comes along and inhibits your freedom, you should be very cautious about that.
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:42.121]  You should be very suspicious.
[02:51:42.641 --> 02:51:48.641]   because anything that comes along that can inhibit your freedom is by definition anti-american.
[02:51:48.641 --> 02:52:01.121]  It's October 1st, 2021 and I've got good news for you.
[02:52:01.333 --> 02:52:02.414]  I've got good news for me.
[02:52:02.514 --> 02:52:06.858]  I've got good news for everybody alive in America and on this planet today.
[02:52:07.742 --> 02:52:14.305]  Now we spent years developing this, and it's probably one of the strongest, cleanest formulas in the world.
[02:52:14.345 --> 02:52:15.245]  There may be something better.
[02:52:15.685 --> 02:52:16.425]  We don't know about it.
[02:52:16.446 --> 02:52:23.468]  It's made by one of the top labs in the United States that we private label it from, because again, if we said their name, they'd get attacked by the left.
[02:52:24.029 --> 02:52:26.029]  This stuff is incredible.
[02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:29.471]  It is Brain Force Ultra.
[02:52:30.311 --> 02:52:33.996]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:52:34.336 --> 02:52:39.723]  We got a limited run of this in a month ago and it sold out in three days.
[02:52:39.743 --> 02:52:43.067]  And we already had a larger batch getting developed.
[02:52:43.727 --> 02:52:45.149]  The ingredients came in.
[02:52:46.070 --> 02:52:48.511]  And the new batch is here, and I just took some today.
[02:52:49.131 --> 02:52:54.912]  And I think it's even stronger than the last batch, because this stuff, again, is done in a lab, but it's done organically.
[02:52:54.952 --> 02:53:02.274]  So each batch varies a little bit, but it does get all the testing done to show that it's at least up to a basic strength, and this is actually above that.
[02:53:02.614 --> 02:53:04.654]  So we got BrainForce Ultra back in stock.
[02:53:05.055 --> 02:53:09.856]  We got a big shipment in, but it's so popular, I think it's going to sell out in probably a week.
[02:53:10.376 --> 02:53:14.857]  Despite that, we're going to offer it at 50% off the introductory rate.
[02:53:15.417 --> 02:53:17.058]  For at least four or five days.
[02:53:17.419 --> 02:53:19.801]  That's why I'm saying it's October 1st.
[02:53:20.421 --> 02:53:21.982]  I'm gonna run this until October 5th.
[02:53:22.162 --> 02:53:22.983]  Hell, it may sell out.
[02:53:23.303 --> 02:53:35.112]  And that's good news for Infowars because we desperately need funding in the face of the Democratic Party assault, their rigged courts, their kangaroo systems, and their attempts to silence us and silence you.
[02:53:35.132 --> 02:53:37.294]  Because that's why they're coming after us is to get to you.
[02:53:37.514 --> 02:53:39.676]  We are all in this together as Benjamin Franklin said.
[02:53:40.296 --> 02:53:42.238]  And if we don't hang together, we're going to hang separate.
[02:53:42.478 --> 02:53:43.459]  You've been hanging with us.
[02:53:43.720 --> 02:53:44.641]  You've been keeping us on air.
[02:53:44.661 --> 02:53:45.521]  You've been spreading the word.
[02:53:45.902 --> 02:53:47.964]  And it's having an incredible effect.
[02:53:48.004 --> 02:53:50.587]  In fact, let me spend a minute or so on that before I get back into this.
[02:53:51.387 --> 02:53:53.930]  I had a chance to go up to Glenn Beck's The Blaze.
[02:53:54.751 --> 02:53:58.214]  I had a chance to hang out with Steven Crowder at his offices outside The Blaze.
[02:53:58.555 --> 02:54:02.639]  And I had a chance to meet with a lot of other big reporters and other pundits.
[02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:06.262]  A lot of them thought I was full of it 10 years ago or even 5 years ago.
[02:54:06.302 --> 02:54:09.646]  They now see everything I predict to come true and we had a hero's welcome there.
[02:54:10.206 --> 02:54:12.108]  And it's happening all over the place.
[02:54:12.328 --> 02:54:13.770]  But that's because of your support.
[02:54:14.230 --> 02:54:17.033]  If you didn't keep us on air, the world wouldn't be waking up.
[02:54:17.401 --> 02:54:20.343]  When this tyranny launches attack, we would be losing.
[02:54:20.363 --> 02:54:21.144]  We'd be submitting.
[02:54:21.524 --> 02:54:27.109]  But instead, all over the world, from Australia to the United States, people are fighting back and waking up.
[02:54:27.729 --> 02:54:32.353]  And Infowars, at least half the time that we talk to people, is the catalyst that woke them up.
[02:54:32.413 --> 02:54:34.255]  That means you're the catalyst that woke them up.
[02:54:34.615 --> 02:54:36.977]  So again, BrainForce Ultra is back in stock.
[02:54:36.997 --> 02:54:38.939]  You've got to go see what is in this.
[02:54:38.979 --> 02:54:39.899]  Let me just read you some of the things.
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:42.682]  Guarana Seed, look into what that does.
[02:54:43.282 --> 02:54:44.863]  Alpha GPC, woo!
[02:54:45.444 --> 02:54:54.151]  Green Coffee Bean, Alethro Root, Yerba Mate Leaf, Green Tea Leaves, Ginkgo Leaf, Ashwagandha Root, and more.
[02:54:54.271 --> 02:54:57.573]  And they are strong, organic, cold-pressed.
[02:54:57.593 --> 02:55:01.877]  This isn't dry garbage, this isn't old trash, this is new.
[02:55:02.417 --> 02:55:09.443]  At one of the best labs, I'm gonna say the best, there might be one better, but it's the best we know of, and we are so proud to bring you this, and that it funds the M4.
[02:55:10.123 --> 02:55:15.805]  Clean, long, sustained, deep, focused energy where you don't have the crash.
[02:55:16.185 --> 02:55:26.129]   If you love turbo force, if you love brain force plus that are both different formulas that are excellent, you're going to absolutely love brain force Ultra.
[02:55:26.810 --> 02:55:27.870]  All three are different formulas.
[02:55:28.370 --> 02:55:29.571]  All three do different things.
[02:55:29.971 --> 02:55:33.972]  But I got to tell you, of the three, drop for drop, this is the strongest ever.
[02:55:34.353 --> 02:55:34.553]  50% off.
[02:55:34.933 --> 02:55:35.973]  Infowarsstore.com.

[02:55:45.197 --> 02:55:46.618]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:55:47.658 --> 02:55:52.563]  And remember that every person you reach out to now is one step closer to our victory.
[02:55:52.923 --> 02:55:54.184]  So thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[02:55:54.444 --> 02:55:55.485]  We're never going to back down.
[02:55:55.805 --> 02:55:56.966]  God bless and good luck.
[02:55:57.187 --> 02:56:01.230]  By now you've heard me talk about the BioProbes and how they're creating amazing products.
[02:56:01.611 --> 02:56:10.258]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bioremediation products, bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[02:56:10.538 --> 02:56:14.422]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.

[02:56:47.516 --> 02:56:48.397]  Guaranteed.
[02:56:48.857 --> 02:56:50.077]  Just pour and add water.
[02:56:50.257 --> 02:56:50.858]  It's that simple.
[02:56:50.938 --> 02:56:54.438]  Visit thebiopros.com and see for yourself.
[02:56:55.438 --> 02:57:09.824]   I'm taping this on September 29th, And this special sale is only gonna run for one week and one week only.
[02:57:10.205 --> 02:57:15.489]  In fact, some of the items here are about to sell out, but we need the funds, so I'm discounting them regardless.
[02:57:15.529 --> 02:57:18.912]  That's where we are at InfoWars, and the fight is so intense.

[02:57:27.699 --> 02:57:29.381]  I would take advantage of this sale.
[02:57:29.881 --> 02:57:31.142]  This has been a really big seller.
[02:57:31.162 --> 02:57:32.724]  We're down to a few thousand bottles of it.
[02:57:33.204 --> 02:57:34.925]  We'll probably be next year till we get more in.
[02:57:35.066 --> 02:57:36.567]  It is our green fiber capsules.
[02:57:37.187 --> 02:57:45.715]  It's derived from the highest quality sprouts that you're going to find out there and other known ingredients that give you the roughage you need.

[02:58:05.225 --> 02:58:09.347]  Hair and Beard Formula was sold out of our great multivitamin mineral product.
[02:58:10.168 --> 02:58:11.629]  People like hair and beard formula?
[02:58:12.150 --> 02:58:15.132]  This is probably as good or better than our formula.
[02:58:15.552 --> 02:58:21.297]  So it's great for your hair, great for your beard, great for women's nails, and their clothes, or women nowadays have beards as well.
[02:58:21.597 --> 02:58:27.162]  So it's great for women's beards, but seriously, it's also fantastic as a multivitamin mineral.
[02:58:27.922 --> 02:58:33.067]  In fact, we're probably just going to change the label on it and put one out as a multivitamin mineral, because this is really an amazing formulation.

[02:58:49.134 --> 02:58:51.174]  At least twice as strong as Knockout.
[02:58:51.774 --> 02:58:52.655]  Too strong for some people.
[02:58:53.095 --> 02:58:54.915]  Down and Out is a different formula.
[02:58:55.515 --> 02:58:58.536]  And this sucker sold out in its first run very, very quickly.
