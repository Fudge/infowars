[00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:16.319]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:17.900]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:27.118]  Well, the imposter in chief, the
[00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:56.796]  Walking dead man.
[00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:59.157]  The zombie.
[00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:01.857]  Man that stumbles and falls upstairs.
[00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:06.778]  Like some type of poltergeist.
[00:01:06.778 --> 00:01:13.360]  Walked out yesterday from the White House without his mask on to do the little ritual of taking it off up on the stage.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.000]  And the world just marveled, we're free!
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.561]  And he said, I'm giving you your freedom back.
[00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.002]  You've earned your right to smile.
[00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:27.045]  Oh, I'm sorry, you didn't say right.
[00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:41.395]  He said the privilege to smile, seeing someone's face, I guess, in Saudi Arabia or in North Korea, because they're not in a death camp, or one of the apple slave camps in China or here in America is now a privilege.
[00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:49.780]  We have that clip coming up for you today on this live May 14th, 2021 transmission.
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.342]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:58.669]  But here's really the big news.
[00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:03.952]  I got a lot of phone calls last night from cousins and family.
[00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:14.720]  And my wife asked me, once my daughter had gone to bed at about nine at night, the youngest daughter, she said, OK, I mean, there's going to be a lot of traffic tomorrow.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.722]  Everybody thinks the country's reopened.
[00:02:17.722 --> 00:02:21.885]  She said, when do you think they're going to slam it back shut again?
[00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.467]  She listens to the show, and I said, well, I'll cover it all tomorrow.
[00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.887]  But I laid it out for her.
[00:02:27.887 --> 00:02:32.009]  The enemy battle plan tells us how they're going to do it.
[00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:41.212]  And so, guys, why don't you print me some of those articles about... Dayboth Group says we need bi-yearly lockdowns to lower carbon.
[00:02:41.212 --> 00:02:45.874]  And then Greta Thunberg, who's a mouthpiece of the Rothschilds, she's like a little puppet.
[00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:46.775]  Oh, hi.
[00:02:46.775 --> 00:02:47.675]  I'm Greta Thunberg.
[00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:49.596]  You need to cut all the carbon.
[00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:52.437]  You need to pay the Rothschilds to live your life.
[00:02:53.163 --> 00:02:58.529]  Not a very good ventriloquist, but that's basically what's going on.
[00:02:58.529 --> 00:02:59.610]  Oh, hi!
[00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.952]  Let's get rid of all the humans!
[00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:14.126]  So we're going to be laying all that out today about, oh, we're learning that the government tells us when we can go outside, and they tell us when we can show our face, and they tell us if we're essential or non-essential.
[00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:26.124]  When we take our experimental Franken-shots, but Fauci, the guy openly being investigated for launching the attack on purpose, we know he cooked up the COVID-19.
[00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:33.812]  He said children that did not have vaccine cards could never show their face at football, or at school, or in the track field.
[00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:35.053]  They're dirty little buggers.
[00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.792]  They gotta have their little special IDs showing we put in them what we wanted to's.
[00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:43.252]  Or they can't show their dirty faces.
[00:03:43.252 --> 00:03:45.433]  You hear that, you piehole Americans?
[00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:49.254]  Cover your stinking filthy pieholes!
[00:03:49.254 --> 00:03:51.415]  Fowchee said so, huh?
[00:03:51.415 --> 00:03:56.497]  And if you don't do what he says, he's, uh... Let's send a cop over there and beat you with a billy club!
[00:03:56.497 --> 00:04:03.139]  Cause we got plenty of video of that, uh... In Canada and Australia and Spain and UK and right here in America!
[00:04:04.753 --> 00:04:07.417]  So we're going to be breaking it all down today.
[00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:09.920]  And I'll even give you the timeline.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.462]  I mean, we know the timeline.
[00:04:11.462 --> 00:04:12.764]  We got it from the EU.
[00:04:12.764 --> 00:04:13.926]  We got all the documents in.
[00:04:15.146 --> 00:04:26.651]  Australia, and in Canada, where they would have phase one, phase two, phase three, in Canada by phase three, total martial law, and to the day the documents said they did it.
[00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:30.653]  Oh, but of course they said those documents were fake, even though they were real.
[00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:33.174]  Everybody asked eight months ago whether those were real or not.
[00:04:33.174 --> 00:04:42.778]  I just search engine what was in the document, and pulled up pieces of it in the EU and UN announcements, and transcripts of speeches that premiers in Canada had given.
[00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:44.399]  Of course the damn thing was real.
[00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:48.555]  It's all in this book, which I re-read last weekend.
[00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:50.097]  I read this stinking thing twice.
[00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:51.980]  Makes me want to have a heart attack reading it.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.562]  He admits the whole thing!
[00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:56.145]  He's just drooling over us and gloating!
[00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:57.827]  I want Schwab arrested now!
[00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:05.414]  People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year?
[00:05:05.414 --> 00:05:13.463]  Because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year, it's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution.
[00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:16.587]  And not just that, fuel and every other major commodity.
[00:05:16.827 --> 00:05:18.949]  The globalists want a post-industrial world.
[00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.751]  They're hitting us with economic war.
[00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:22.313]  I told you food prices would explode.
[00:05:22.313 --> 00:05:23.454]  They're now exploding.
[00:05:23.454 --> 00:05:26.417]  Our great sponsor, MyPatriot, has barely gone up in price.
[00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:30.201]  Their competitors have gone up even more, but they're about to go up in two weeks.
[00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:36.927]  But instead of just holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening, and then it's got to go up.
[00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:38.309]  10% off at infowarestore.com.
[00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:46.997]  You've got to act now, and buying your food from us funds the InfoWar 360Win.
[00:05:46.997 --> 00:05:47.918]  It's ready to ship.
[00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:49.219]  They've got it on hand.
[00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:54.084]  Get yours before the scarcity and the lines start, which I think we'll see by next fall.
[00:05:54.084 --> 00:05:55.746]  Hell, a lot of shelves are already empty.
[00:05:55.746 --> 00:05:56.606]  This is crazy.
[00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.008]  We're being collapsed by design.
[00:05:58.008 --> 00:05:58.829]  Get ready now.
[00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:00.030]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[00:06:14.878 --> 00:06:29.527]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance, broadcasting worldwide in defiance of the New World Order, thanks to you, the people of the United States and the world.
[00:06:29.527 --> 00:06:41.995]  So from myself, Alex Jones, to everyone else across the planet, I salute you, and I thank you for joining us here today.
[00:06:41.995 --> 00:06:42.736]  Wow!
[00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.197]  Free bird, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.022]  That free bird's gonna fly.
[00:06:47.022 --> 00:06:51.005]  And there's nothing the New World Order can do to stop it.
[00:06:51.005 --> 00:07:00.152]  Their big, giant, planned, lockdown counter-offensive that I laid out in my film, Endgame, 14 years ago, that they lay out in their Rockefeller plan 11 years ago.
[00:07:01.374 --> 00:07:23.645]  It was very successful at first, but just like Napoleon and just like Hitler, bogging down in the mud in Russia, they bogged down again, and now they're gonna get in trouble, and now we're gonna launch our counter-counteroffensive against them, and they're gonna pull a bunch of other dangerous evil stuff, but now everybody's getting wise.
[00:07:23.645 --> 00:07:28.588]  Everybody knows that the captain lied.
[00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.976]  And they're talking to us all like we are idiots.
[00:07:35.976 --> 00:07:42.504]  So let me give you the newsflash.
[00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:48.231]  In the Great Reset, and that's the guy running the show, he's one of the top generals along with Bill Gates and others.
[00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:51.014]  Though Gates is being relieved of his command right now.
[00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:54.770]  Because he's not been a very good spokesperson.
[00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:06.538]  See, they're all psychotics and sociopaths, so they can't gauge how fake and wooden and leering and jacquard lanniness, like an evil jack-o'-lantern, uh, that Gates is.
[00:08:06.538 --> 00:08:14.323]  I mean, they don't think Schwab looks like Blofeld, which is a dead ringer, only he's a cat in his lap, of Dr. Evil, or a James Bond villain.
[00:08:14.323 --> 00:08:20.588]  You know, the Hollywood's archetype of a James Bond villain is a guy in a suit one size too small,
[00:08:21.624 --> 00:08:26.026]  With a bald head who's German, stroking a cat.
[00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:32.548]  Then you add to it, we will cut the power off and take over the economy and let them starve to death.
[00:08:32.548 --> 00:08:42.272]  They will be scared of the virus we release and then the cure will be much worse than the actual virus.
[00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:47.074]  You see, people are like, well wait, is life imitating art?
[00:08:47.074 --> 00:08:49.234]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:49.234 --> 00:08:50.655]  That's not how art works.
[00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:55.088]  Art imitates how the real world works.
[00:08:55.088 --> 00:08:56.348]  High art does.
[00:08:56.348 --> 00:09:02.490]  And then the general public tries to imitate how the high art looks, thinking that it created that.
[00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:09.952]  But I've learned, being at the lowest levels, and I mean the highest, of the stinking Hollywood system in Washington, D.C.
[00:09:09.952 --> 00:09:16.974]  and all of it, I've poked around in those sewers, that it's worse than Hollywood shows.
[00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:18.634]  Like, I used to think in Hollywood movies
[00:09:20.006 --> 00:09:25.790]  When Robert De Niro says, I don't want to have to kill you, but I really like you, you're my friend.
[00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:30.393]  That's the worst acting of how an Italian gangster would act.
[00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:33.915]  Until I learned that that's actually how the real ones do act.
[00:09:33.915 --> 00:09:36.157]  I'm like, oh my God, they're actually imitating the real thing.
[00:09:36.157 --> 00:09:37.098]  And it's the same deal.
[00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:44.643]  I'm like, why in all these cartoons and movies does the villain brag and gloat and tell people why they're doing it?
[00:09:44.643 --> 00:09:46.504]  Because that's what they actually do in criminology.
[00:09:50.524 --> 00:09:55.086]  And so we got Bill Gates running around talking about, I want to depopulate the earth, and I want to get rid of people.
[00:09:55.086 --> 00:10:10.371]  And then you've got this huge history banned in 30-plus countries from giving people sterolins in the vaccines, giving people HIV, giving people polio, the one where he got red-handed caught, even admitted in Reuters.
[00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:17.413]  The UN officially admits, well, yeah, Gates' program in about 10 countries did give millions of people polio, no big deal.
[00:10:17.413 --> 00:10:18.754]  They try to write whitewashes about it.
[00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:27.692]  It's crazy how they just admit out of one side of their mouth, I want to kill everybody, there's too many people.
[00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:33.495]  And oh, my dad ran the World Eugenics Society, my mom ran the IBM Trust for Hitler, literally.
[00:10:33.495 --> 00:10:40.038]  I mean, Hitler took orders from Thomas Watson, basically.
[00:10:40.038 --> 00:10:43.359]  And she carried on the trust of Thomas Watson.
[00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:45.400]  What do you think the Carnegie Endowment is?
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.841]  What do you think the Ford Foundation is?
[00:10:46.841 --> 00:10:49.422]  And you know, I'm always telling you how the Carnegie Endowment's on the top.
[00:10:50.586 --> 00:10:53.587]  And all these other foundations operate through it, like Bill Gates.
[00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:56.508]  But Bill Gates is one of the main generals.
[00:10:56.508 --> 00:10:59.149]  And now, who's the new CIA director?
[00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:06.632]  Former director of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace.
[00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:09.013]  And how do they give you peace?
[00:11:09.013 --> 00:11:13.175]  Oh, there will be peace.
[00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:18.137]  There will be no more war and no more famine, because most people will be dead.
[00:11:20.982 --> 00:11:25.943]  So you want to know about transgenderism and human cloning and the fluoride in the water?
[00:11:25.943 --> 00:11:32.084]  It's all the Carnegie Endowment on World Peace.
[00:11:32.084 --> 00:11:41.265]  By the 1920s, the plan had been 100% adopted by the robber barons of the world, the British royal family.
[00:11:41.265 --> 00:11:44.446]  It's all in the Royal Commission on Population, 1948.
[00:11:44.446 --> 00:11:46.206]  It's all in the documents.
[00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:50.047]  And these guys are just carrying out the plan and now we're just living under it.
[00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:54.792]  So, let me tell you what's going down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:54.792 --> 00:12:12.402]  I always said, in places where they couldn't keep the lockdown going, they already had it actuaried out, they knew that people wouldn't put up with it, they already tested it, they already did psychological studies, that's all declassified, through major universities around the world, that they would have a lockdown for a while, then a mask, then have small businesses shut down,
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.622]  Those that followed orders.
[00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:17.485]  Train the police and others that people not wearing masks are criminals.
[00:12:17.485 --> 00:12:20.188]  That would then be moved on to those that haven't had shots in the future.
[00:12:20.188 --> 00:12:26.996]  You'll have to show your phone that you've had a vaccine to even come in, much less, you know, that you don't have to wear a mask.
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:38.646]  And then children at the school will be discriminated against by the school boards and the corrupt teachers union, to where, oh, your child isn't, so now they've got to wear a mask and they're not allowed to be in curricular activities.
[00:12:38.646 --> 00:12:44.069]  Persecuting them because an experimental, deadly frankenshot that doesn't even protect them hasn't been given to them.
[00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:52.712]  And then also the big globalist companies can't afford to bring in new employees and go through the crises they've created.
[00:12:52.712 --> 00:13:01.277]  But smaller warehouses, police departments, businesses, farms, everyone wants to do the right thing and have constant PCR tests that are 99% of the time fake.
[00:13:01.277 --> 00:13:09.761]  You get a false positive, you're totally well, they call it asymptomatic, but then everybody else has to shut down the warehouse because they're all scared.
[00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.343]  And now you can't do business in America, but everybody else in the world is.
[00:13:15.151 --> 00:13:16.051]  Europe can't do business.
[00:13:16.051 --> 00:13:16.811]  We can't do business.
[00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:18.192]  Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:13:18.192 --> 00:13:20.512]  Because the globalists are bringing us under heel.
[00:13:20.512 --> 00:13:21.593]  They're bankrupting us.
[00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:22.733]  They're preparing us.
[00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:25.174]  And we need governors to come out and say that.
[00:13:25.174 --> 00:13:26.074]  And senators.
[00:13:26.074 --> 00:13:26.814]  And House members.
[00:13:26.814 --> 00:13:28.934]  And Rand Paul's starting to do it.
[00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:32.715]  And he's even past DeSantis now.
[00:13:32.715 --> 00:13:33.836]  Rand Paul's got the brains.
[00:13:33.836 --> 00:13:34.576]  He's got the smarts.
[00:13:34.576 --> 00:13:35.096]  He's got it all.
[00:13:36.907 --> 00:13:38.308]  And he's totally presidential material.
[00:13:38.308 --> 00:13:39.849]  He's just got to get hardcore.
[00:13:39.849 --> 00:13:45.434]  And he's starting to say, yeah, Fauci's basically behind the pandemic, but did he do it on purpose?
[00:13:45.434 --> 00:13:47.996]  That's the final question.
[00:13:47.996 --> 00:13:52.859]  And then, of course, the punishment, whether he did it on accident and he got out, his life in prison, did it on purpose?
[00:13:52.859 --> 00:13:56.162]  Well, you know what the punishment is.
[00:13:56.162 --> 00:14:00.545]  But I don't want any harm to Fauci until he's arrested and convicted.
[00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:02.947]  And then, I mean, I think he did this on purpose.
[00:14:02.947 --> 00:14:03.808]  He's killed millions of people.
[00:14:05.709 --> 00:14:07.910]  That little criminal was involved in HIV and everything else.
[00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.292]  He's actually one of the top advisors to Bill Gates.
[00:14:11.292 --> 00:14:14.073]  Bill Gates sat at his fetid knee.
[00:14:14.073 --> 00:14:17.515]  At his scrofulous covered knee.
[00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:18.795]  So that's all coming up.
[00:14:18.795 --> 00:14:21.056]  And I'm going to tell you next segment how I see this going out.
[00:14:21.056 --> 00:14:22.217]  But Spain?
[00:14:23.426 --> 00:14:31.229]  The UK, they call it a release of the lockdown, but you've got to show a scanner, a vaccine passport, social ID to get in.
[00:14:31.229 --> 00:14:32.510]  You get harassed.
[00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.310]  It's never enough.
[00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.731]  Now, oh, you took two shots?
[00:14:34.731 --> 00:14:36.111]  Now there's a new one you've got to have.
[00:14:36.111 --> 00:14:37.252]  And another one, and another one.
[00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:38.192]  And it doesn't even protect you.
[00:14:38.192 --> 00:14:39.653]  And, oh, you've got to have this on a plane.
[00:14:39.653 --> 00:14:43.575]  And then there's all the maskies are like, but Rachel Maddow says, I'm not taking mine off.
[00:14:43.575 --> 00:14:44.135]  I want mine.
[00:14:44.135 --> 00:14:44.975]  I'm keeping it.
[00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:50.758]  And a lot of businesses are saying, in grocery stores in Texas, where I live, and other places, we're never taking them off.
[00:14:50.758 --> 00:14:51.278]  Never!
[00:14:52.222 --> 00:14:53.783]  We like them!
[00:14:53.783 --> 00:14:56.946]  We like bacterial pneumonia, we like it also.
[00:14:56.946 --> 00:15:03.851]  They're gonna take it off in areas of the U.S., still some blue cities, blue areas aren't.
[00:15:03.851 --> 00:15:06.353]  Big corporations aren't gonna take it off.
[00:15:06.353 --> 00:15:11.357]  And then in the winter, they're gonna say, oh, flu's killing a lot and COVID popped back up.
[00:15:11.357 --> 00:15:12.878]  Yeah, wear your mask again.
[00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:14.699]  We're just used to like red light, green light.
[00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:20.904]  Biden comes out and says, oh, mask back on, mask back off, this is total.
[00:15:21.798 --> 00:15:22.798]  Drink your Kool-Aid!
[00:15:22.798 --> 00:15:23.718]  Don't drink your Kool-Aid!
[00:15:23.718 --> 00:15:26.959]  It's all Kool-Aid drinking drills, like Jim Jones had them do.
[00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:31.040]  Thousands of drills, four or five times a day, over years.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.620]  When he said, drink the Kool-Aid, they all came and drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.361]  And the day they put the cyanide in there?
[00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:38.441]  Boy, everybody drank their Kool-Aid.
[00:15:38.441 --> 00:15:41.882]  This is all just, when Biden says jump, you say, how high, sir?
[00:15:41.882 --> 00:15:43.002]  How high?
[00:15:43.002 --> 00:15:47.723]  Doesn't matter how nonsensical, and how it's a giant lie, and how it's a giant fraud, or any of it.
[00:15:47.723 --> 00:15:50.864]  And in the background, they're cooking up a real bio-attack.
[00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:51.524]  Gates told you.
[00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.012]  But see, he ran his mouth.
[00:15:54.012 --> 00:15:56.493]  That's why he's being relieved of command.
[00:15:56.493 --> 00:15:57.193]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:57.193 --> 00:15:59.675]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.675 --> 00:16:11.700]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:18.784]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[00:16:18.784 --> 00:16:20.665]  Their first product they are launching is called
[00:16:20.985 --> 00:16:25.967]  BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[00:16:25.967 --> 00:16:30.768]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[00:16:30.768 --> 00:16:32.729]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:42.051]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:46.873]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[00:16:46.873 --> 00:16:50.654]  Visit thebiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:53.015]  That's TheBiopros.com.
[00:16:53.015 --> 00:16:57.177]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks, and the job it does is unparalleled.
[00:16:57.177 --> 00:17:00.399]  TheBiopros.com.
[00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:03.700]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.162]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[00:17:07.162 --> 00:17:10.784]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegory.
[00:17:11.852 --> 00:17:22.917]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:25.238]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about 8 hours.
[00:17:25.238 --> 00:17:30.980]  But people take this, people are taking it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:37.183]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[00:17:37.183 --> 00:17:38.623]  It's a total solution.
[00:17:38.623 --> 00:17:39.784]  All around the best you're going to find.
[00:17:39.904 --> 00:17:40.905]  Turbo Force.
[00:17:40.905 --> 00:17:43.166]  Without you, we don't roll.
[00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:44.867]  With you, we surge forward together.
[00:17:44.867 --> 00:17:46.908]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[00:17:46.908 --> 00:17:49.529]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[00:17:49.529 --> 00:17:52.571]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:53.591]  It's a win-win.
[00:17:53.591 --> 00:17:54.092]  360 together.
[00:17:54.092 --> 00:17:55.132]  Infowarstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:17:55.132 --> 00:17:56.473]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:21.793]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18:21.793 --> 00:18:29.116]  I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise.
[00:18:29.116 --> 00:18:32.837]  I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes.
[00:18:32.837 --> 00:18:38.159]  I can see for miles and miles and miles
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:57.286]  And I don't need to see for miles, it's now right in my face, world government, people that lead it, write books about how they want to depopulate us and how they were going to launch a virus to have a lockdown to lower our carbon and teach us to have less.
[00:18:57.286 --> 00:19:03.508]  But oh, they're all ordering even bigger super yachts and jumbo jets for themselves and having four or five children.
[00:19:03.508 --> 00:19:07.250]  It's just you and I that can't do that.
[00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.871]  So let's go ahead and look at it.
[00:19:08.871 --> 00:19:10.511]  Here's COVID-19, the Great Reset.
[00:19:10.511 --> 00:19:11.552]  Klaus Schwab, he had this out.
[00:19:12.478 --> 00:19:21.543]  Within a month of the pandemic being announced, and of course it's all things he'd said for years before, I suggest you read it about how good the lockdowns would be to teach us to have less.
[00:19:21.543 --> 00:19:25.445]  It's all right in the conclusion of the book.
[00:19:25.445 --> 00:19:26.706]  There's a free copy of it online.
[00:19:26.706 --> 00:19:28.407]  You just type it in, you can find it.
[00:19:28.407 --> 00:19:29.668]  Look at this!
[00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:33.129]  London Guardian, the equivalent of COVID emission drops even every two years.
[00:19:33.129 --> 00:19:33.970]  Study.
[00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.791]  The Guardian changed this headline.
[00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:36.952]  You can find it on the Wayback Machine.
[00:19:36.952 --> 00:19:41.054]  At first they said, we need climate lockdowns every year.
[00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:44.651]  But folks have the copies of that, in fact.
[00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:45.111]  Report!
[00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:50.315]  World needs equivalent of pandemic lockdown every two years to meet Paris carbon emission goals.
[00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:54.438]  Forbes followed their lead.
[00:19:54.438 --> 00:19:56.760]  And then here's a bunch of other articles about how great it's going to be.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.581]  Oh, but guess what?
[00:19:57.581 --> 00:20:00.783]  Only the West will make those changes when we're so clean.
[00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:03.185]  China and India will make zero.
[00:20:03.185 --> 00:20:04.666]  And the globalists are invested there.
[00:20:04.666 --> 00:20:08.389]  And then that lowers the world income.
[00:20:08.389 --> 00:20:10.671]  That's a giant sucking scoundrel Ross Perot talked about.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.661]  We become the third world, not the other way.
[00:20:13.661 --> 00:20:18.402]  Client scientists want pandemic lockdowns every two years.
[00:20:18.402 --> 00:20:19.723]  Aww.
[00:20:19.723 --> 00:20:21.043]  Foreign policy.
[00:20:21.043 --> 00:20:22.124]  CFR.
[00:20:22.124 --> 00:20:24.505]  Lockdowns have been amazing for the environment.
[00:20:24.505 --> 00:20:26.345]  But COVID-19 won't heal the planet.
[00:20:26.345 --> 00:20:29.606]  Oh, that good old COVID-19.
[00:20:29.606 --> 00:20:34.228]  They told us about how it would save us, and how good it is, and how it's an opportunity.
[00:20:35.729 --> 00:20:36.909]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:43.411]  World Economic Forum says lockdowns are quietly improving cities around the world.
[00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:45.531]  What they want next is scary.
[00:20:45.531 --> 00:20:46.711]  Oh, yes.
[00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:47.671]  But that's okay.
[00:20:47.671 --> 00:20:50.632]  It's okay if they run death camps around the world.
[00:20:50.632 --> 00:20:54.133]  You know, it's okay if they want to give us 200 square foot apartments and charge us the same amount for 1,000 foot.
[00:20:54.133 --> 00:20:59.234]  It's okay if they want to take our cars away, and that's in the news.
[00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:01.034]  Because they're for Black Lives Matter!
[00:21:03.143 --> 00:21:05.404]  That wants to get rid of the nuclear family again.
[00:21:05.404 --> 00:21:07.245]  That'll help everybody.
[00:21:07.245 --> 00:21:07.786]  They hide.
[00:21:07.786 --> 00:21:12.328]  I mean, that's why every corporate ad now is black people.
[00:21:12.328 --> 00:21:17.031]  Fighter jet ads, military ads, banking ads, 5G ads.
[00:21:17.031 --> 00:21:18.792]  It's like, I'm black and I like 5G.
[00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:21.794]  People are like, well, I better be for 5G.
[00:21:21.794 --> 00:21:28.237]  Literally, the globalists have taken black people as their political, cultural camouflage.
[00:21:28.237 --> 00:21:30.599]  That's why 10.6 billion got given last year.
[00:21:32.361 --> 00:21:36.224]  To Black Lives Matter movements by the big banks.
[00:21:36.224 --> 00:21:37.164]  10.6 billion.
[00:21:37.164 --> 00:21:39.846]  And of course, 95% of it never went to black people.
[00:21:39.846 --> 00:21:41.087]  That's in big studies.
[00:21:41.087 --> 00:21:48.872]  It all went right back when Bill Gates or Tim Cook or Bloomberg gives money to these foundations.
[00:21:48.872 --> 00:21:53.135]  It goes right back to them tax exempt.
[00:21:53.135 --> 00:21:58.079]  I gave a billion dollars to help black people in Africa by giving them deadly shots.
[00:22:00.882 --> 00:22:02.743]  And it's just amazing.
[00:22:02.743 --> 00:22:13.707]  And then I see, like, on Twitter and Facebook, black groups fighting with the Palestinians to be the most, you know, the most abused, most woke group, and begging the UN that was created by the globalists to save them.
[00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:14.827]  It's just, it's totally sick.
[00:22:14.827 --> 00:22:19.469]  And I shouldn't, I'm not laughing, I'm laughing in pain here.
[00:22:19.469 --> 00:22:21.050]  So let me play you some of these sick clips.
[00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.350]  This will take a few segments to get to all these.
[00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.931]  I watched it live yesterday in the war room.
[00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:38.752]  Fox News is on in the break room and I was getting a glass of ice water and I watched Fox News celebrating going, look at him!
[00:22:38.752 --> 00:22:39.913]  He's not wearing a mask!
[00:22:39.913 --> 00:22:41.413]  He came out not wearing one!
[00:22:41.413 --> 00:22:43.793]  He only takes it off on the stage!
[00:22:43.793 --> 00:22:45.674]  In the sycophantic, erotic ritual!
[00:22:45.674 --> 00:22:47.494]  They're like, oh it's so wonderful!
[00:22:47.494 --> 00:22:48.074]  This is it!
[00:22:48.074 --> 00:22:48.494]  This is it!
[00:22:48.494 --> 00:22:49.675]  He's gonna free us!
[00:22:49.675 --> 00:22:51.755]  And he said, you don't have to wear them!
[00:22:51.755 --> 00:22:54.936]  You've earned the right to show your face!
[00:22:54.936 --> 00:22:56.316]  Dirk and Dirk of Muhammad Jihad.
[00:22:57.955 --> 00:23:00.097]  Whoever said we wouldn't have Sharia law?
[00:23:00.097 --> 00:23:01.358]  It's called COVID law.
[00:23:01.358 --> 00:23:04.540]  We're all post-COVID now.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:10.204]  And then he went on to really make these disgusting Orwellian comments.
[00:23:10.204 --> 00:23:16.649]  He also said, please treat people that want to keep wearing their babas, their little dirty bacteria diaper.
[00:23:17.395 --> 00:23:18.756]  Please treat them nice.
[00:23:18.756 --> 00:23:19.577]  They're scared.
[00:23:19.577 --> 00:23:20.397]  Oh, oh!
[00:23:20.397 --> 00:23:26.302]  And on transportation, buses, trains, ships, and planes, you're still gonna wear them.
[00:23:26.302 --> 00:23:27.443]  Ha ha ha!
[00:23:27.443 --> 00:23:30.145]  Ha ha ha!
[00:23:30.145 --> 00:23:31.666]  Sorry, I'm turning into Woody Woodpecker here.
[00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:36.230]  Because this is so crazy!
[00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.412]  It's such a cult takeover!
[00:23:38.412 --> 00:23:40.173]  And it's all in Operation Lockstep 2011.
[00:23:40.173 --> 00:23:46.578]  How they create fear, set up global authoritarianism, create a world tracking ID, and now Klaus Schwab says,
[00:23:47.737 --> 00:23:51.518]  First, you will wear bracelets, and then you will get implantable chip.
[00:23:51.518 --> 00:23:57.120]  Within five years, you will all have chips.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.901]  Oh, he said that five years ago.
[00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:01.601]  Five years ago, he said ten years.
[00:24:01.601 --> 00:24:02.622]  Now it's five.
[00:24:02.622 --> 00:24:10.044]  He's like, there will be a deadly virus, and you will have a World ID card for your health.
[00:24:10.044 --> 00:24:15.426]  And then there will be chip on your bracelet, chip in your clothing, and chip in your brain.
[00:24:15.426 --> 00:24:16.626]  Everyone will have chip.
[00:24:17.208 --> 00:24:20.549]  We will merge you with Chip.
[00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:23.549]  The virus coming, get ready!
[00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:25.510]  It's going to be good!
[00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:34.131]  Now I'm going to have an Eastern European voice on a German one, but... It's going to be nice for you to get your friendship!
[00:24:34.131 --> 00:24:35.531]  I am Klaus Schwab!
[00:24:35.531 --> 00:24:37.372]  You are non-essential!
[00:24:37.372 --> 00:24:41.132]  That's liberal now!
[00:24:41.132 --> 00:24:43.713]  Just go in your house and starve to death!
[00:24:43.713 --> 00:24:43.773]  Ha!
[00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:51.796]  I look like Vamp... Albino Vampire Bat?
[00:24:51.796 --> 00:24:53.697]  Alright, I'm going to stop joking.
[00:24:53.697 --> 00:24:55.358]  It doesn't matter.
[00:24:55.358 --> 00:24:59.501]  Here is... Oh, by the way, the top story on InfoWars is not even all this.
[00:24:59.501 --> 00:25:00.241]  I'm sorry.
[00:25:00.241 --> 00:25:04.204]  Can we put the live show feed up, please?
[00:25:04.204 --> 00:25:11.228]  It's... Evidence overwhelmingly shows now, and I've got a giant stack confirming it, law enforcement's investigating, that
[00:25:13.493 --> 00:25:17.674]  Dominion wiped all the servers illegally after the election and covered up the paper trail.
[00:25:17.674 --> 00:25:19.355]  Of course we knew that.
[00:25:19.355 --> 00:25:23.356]  And now, by the hand counts, they found that Trump won by a giant landslide.
[00:25:23.356 --> 00:25:26.017]  And the same tactics were used in every other state, but they stole the election.
[00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:49.531]  Of the live radio show, globalist document show that they're planning.
[00:25:49.531 --> 00:25:50.792]  More lockdown soon!
[00:25:50.792 --> 00:25:52.232]  Tune in and find out!
[00:25:52.232 --> 00:26:02.436]  So here's the thing, I'm gonna be a good boy, I'm gonna go on a break, and I'm gonna hit the cover news judicially, judiciously, like a news person and behave myself.
[00:26:02.436 --> 00:26:04.957]  This is getting too crazy right now, too fruity.
[00:26:04.957 --> 00:26:08.719]  And then I'll hit that huge election news after that, then open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast.
[00:26:09.542 --> 00:26:16.666]  We have a doctor coming on with a new, just a new big study that what we already see in front of your eyes, that the vaccines are killing way more people than COVID did.
[00:26:16.666 --> 00:26:20.547]  And they're calling people that had COVID that it's actually killing them.
[00:26:20.547 --> 00:26:23.269]  They're calling it COVID when it's the vaccines.
[00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:25.110]  And now we even have a major medical study showing it.
[00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.330]  So God help us.
[00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.071]  I mean, that's what's crazy is they really did it.
[00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:33.594]  I mean, they are really killing a crap load of people right now with these damn vaccines and maiming tons of others.
[00:26:33.594 --> 00:26:35.875]  And maybe you don't care about those people because they're too dumb, you know, and took it.
[00:26:36.972 --> 00:26:37.892]  Or too trusting.
[00:26:37.892 --> 00:26:39.813]  But it's going to weigh the economy down!
[00:26:39.813 --> 00:26:44.654]  A bunch of them are going to be zombies now, with strokes and stuff.
[00:26:44.654 --> 00:26:47.894]  They're going to be changing their diapers for 20 damn years.
[00:26:47.894 --> 00:26:51.175]  All because of fricking Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[00:26:51.175 --> 00:26:51.875]  And Fauci.
[00:26:51.875 --> 00:26:52.635]  My Lord!
[00:26:52.635 --> 00:26:55.516]  When are they going to get SWAT team and arrested?
[00:26:55.516 --> 00:26:58.477]  Stay with us.
[00:26:58.477 --> 00:27:05.438]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:11.523]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[00:27:11.523 --> 00:27:19.390]  But the good news is, we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:20.871]  Humanity is strong.
[00:27:20.871 --> 00:27:21.831]  We're incredible.
[00:27:21.831 --> 00:27:25.614]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[00:27:25.614 --> 00:27:28.076]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[00:27:28.076 --> 00:27:34.001]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[00:27:34.401 --> 00:27:44.064]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[00:27:44.064 --> 00:27:46.365]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:27:46.365 --> 00:27:49.026]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[00:27:49.026 --> 00:27:54.368]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, vasovets, and others.
[00:27:54.368 --> 00:27:58.329]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[00:27:59.528 --> 00:28:06.091]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say, thank you for what you've done.
[00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:08.032]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[00:28:08.032 --> 00:28:11.794]  Thank you for praying for us, and thank you for spreading the word.
[00:28:11.794 --> 00:28:22.238]  If all of you will simply go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or Droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[00:28:22.238 --> 00:28:27.621]  It will remind you every day like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[00:28:28.181 --> 00:28:34.124]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[00:28:34.124 --> 00:28:40.627]  And in this surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[00:28:40.627 --> 00:28:43.109]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[00:28:43.109 --> 00:28:45.650]  They're available at InfoWareStore.com in four different colors.
[00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.391]  And they are only $19.95.
[00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:52.154]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[00:28:52.154 --> 00:28:55.356]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the Infowar.
[00:28:55.356 --> 00:28:58.398]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the Infowar.
[00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:07.956]  The Globalists comprise the oldest and richest families on Earth, and they have brought down hundreds and hundreds of nations over the last thousand years.
[00:29:07.956 --> 00:29:15.604]  They have bankrupted once successful countries all across the world, and they've used the same formulas of civil unrest.
[00:29:16.224 --> 00:29:17.505]  And Civil War.
[00:29:17.505 --> 00:29:22.268]  And they're doing it again to the United States of America and Europe right now.
[00:29:22.268 --> 00:29:32.213]  Bringing in giant third world populations and then brainwashing them and turning them against the country that they wanted to emigrate to because they knew it was better and had more freedom and more opportunity.
[00:29:32.213 --> 00:29:35.475]  Ladies and gentlemen, America is under scientific attack.
[00:29:35.475 --> 00:29:44.240]  And it's time now more than ever to raise the alarm and warn everyone you know about what's really happening and at the same time get prepared in case things continue to go south like they are.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:52.692]  One of the smartest moves out there is to get high quality, storable food so that as inflation goes up, it's a way to defeat the inflation and have insurance you can eat.
[00:29:52.692 --> 00:29:58.700]  So we've extended the sale through this Sunday at 10% off all storable foods at preparewithalex.com.
[00:30:01.224 --> 00:30:06.187]  One of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was right.
[00:30:06.187 --> 00:30:15.093]  But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[00:30:15.093 --> 00:30:17.555]  But let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today.
[00:30:17.555 --> 00:30:18.535]  And thanks for your support.
[00:30:18.535 --> 00:30:22.838]  We're still on air at InfoWars.com and Bandai Video on radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[00:30:22.978 --> 00:30:23.678]  We're good to go.
[00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.491]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:31:32.332 --> 00:31:38.859]  These eyes cry every night for you.
[00:31:38.859 --> 00:31:41.462]  These arms long to hold you again.
[00:32:02.049 --> 00:32:06.331]  Yeah, freedom's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen, and they're coming to take it.
[00:32:06.331 --> 00:32:08.232]  The only thing that really matters is freedom.
[00:32:08.232 --> 00:32:20.058]  Freedom to worship God, freedom to love your wife, your husband, freedom to live like you want, do what you want to want, and go where you want to want, but not where they want you to go.
[00:32:20.058 --> 00:32:28.021]  Thank you so much for joining us again on this Live Friday Worldwide Transmission, May 14th, 2021.
[00:32:30.362 --> 00:32:35.665]  And we have Joe Hoft joining us at the start of the next hour for two segments.
[00:32:35.665 --> 00:32:41.787]  He's really one of the leading experts as a top corporate fraud investigator for Fortune 500 companies.
[00:32:41.787 --> 00:32:46.950]  He got drafted, as you know, in the last year to come in with Jim Hoft at Gateway Pundit.
[00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:50.772]  And they've been really the best clearinghouse of real research on election fraud.
[00:32:50.772 --> 00:32:53.713]  And now the solid, complete proof
[00:32:54.757 --> 00:33:00.521]  of fraud has been confirmed in Maricopa County, and we'll be covering that coming up next hour.
[00:33:00.521 --> 00:33:12.430]  Dominion Voting Systems admits that they completely wiped everything and will not give any passwords to Maricopa County voting machines to law enforcement, to the Senate, or to the courts.
[00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:21.677]  And now they've been doing the counting and found a 17 plus percent discrepancy from the totals that were put out that night, giving Trump a gigantic landslide victory.
[00:33:22.441 --> 00:33:30.086]  And they found the same thing spot-checking Georgia, the same thing spot-checking Pennsylvania, Michigan, but that was never allowed to go through court.
[00:33:30.086 --> 00:33:32.287]  It was all blocked.
[00:33:32.287 --> 00:33:34.008]  And that's going to happen again.
[00:33:34.008 --> 00:33:38.630]  So Trump responded last night to a voting machine manipulation revealed by Maricopa County Audit.
[00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.011]  That was on the war room.
[00:33:40.011 --> 00:33:40.992]  Even more has come out.
[00:33:40.992 --> 00:33:42.413]  That is coming up, starting the next hour.
[00:33:42.413 --> 00:33:49.577]  And then at the bottom of the hour, we're going to open the phones up on this Friday to get your take on whatever issue you want to raise on air.
[00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:53.605]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:53.605 --> 00:33:57.393]  Thank you so much for joining us here today.
[00:33:57.393 --> 00:34:01.563]  Now, let's start getting right into it.
[00:34:03.283 --> 00:34:26.761]  This is a process that the globalists have put us into, where they ratchet things down, then take it off a little bit, but never as much as it was before, and then clamp back down even more, and then release a little bit, and by the time you're done a few years down the road, you have a world ID, a medical ID, now you've got to have a chip under your skin to be able to get the authorization to travel or have a job, and then it's a chip in your brain.
[00:34:26.761 --> 00:34:31.065]  That's what Klaus Schwab, who's running this whole thing with Bill Gates, said they're going to do.
[00:34:31.767 --> 00:34:34.088]  Some people keep asking, how do you know what comes next?
[00:34:34.088 --> 00:34:37.390]  I mean, I've got their playbook.
[00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:46.114]  In fact, it's more than just if you were a football team that put spies in the stands during training camp.
[00:34:46.114 --> 00:34:51.297]  You know, let's say you're Belichick from the New England Patriots, and that's what he would do famously.
[00:34:51.297 --> 00:34:51.977]  Everybody does it.
[00:34:51.977 --> 00:34:53.097]  He's done it the best.
[00:34:53.097 --> 00:34:54.038]  They've got binoculars.
[00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:55.809]  They've got everything.
[00:34:55.809 --> 00:35:03.934]  Word is they have stingrays out there to grab people's cell phone traffic and find out what the plays are so they can recognize the formations.
[00:35:03.934 --> 00:35:05.415]  I don't just have the playbook.
[00:35:05.415 --> 00:35:10.137]  I have the blueprint, like an architect, of what they were going to build and how they do it.
[00:35:10.137 --> 00:35:19.622]  Because, you know, they can change plays, or you don't know what play they're going to play exactly, or maybe the play's a little bit different, or maybe they know they're being spied on so they mix it up.
[00:35:19.622 --> 00:35:21.723]  This is worse than having the playbook.
[00:35:21.723 --> 00:35:23.164]  This is having the damn script.
[00:35:24.807 --> 00:35:28.110]  And that's what's frustrating about it.
[00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.131]  And you don't have to buy his book.
[00:35:29.131 --> 00:35:33.654]  There's excerpts of it, of Klaus Schwab, great reset quotes online.
[00:35:33.654 --> 00:35:35.196]  And you can read hours of these damn things.
[00:35:35.196 --> 00:35:37.678]  I mean, he's written a bunch of books.
[00:35:37.678 --> 00:35:43.663]  Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[00:35:43.663 --> 00:35:46.465]  End of Humans, basically.
[00:35:46.465 --> 00:35:48.187]  You might want to know about these people.
[00:35:48.187 --> 00:35:50.088]  But let me do what I said I'd do.
[00:35:50.088 --> 00:35:50.989]  Let me get into this right now.
[00:35:52.461 --> 00:35:53.802]  Let's read some of these headlines.
[00:35:53.802 --> 00:35:56.484]  Fauci, kids still need to wear masks.
[00:35:56.484 --> 00:35:58.226]  That's right, get them while they're young.
[00:35:58.226 --> 00:36:05.452]  And if you haven't had a vaccine, you can never take the mask off to put the kids in their own special areas, like Jews wearing yellow stars in Nazi Germany.
[00:36:05.452 --> 00:36:09.115]  Unvaccinated children still need to wear masks, especially indoors.
[00:36:09.115 --> 00:36:19.584]  Fauci, the guy under investigation for deliberately releasing COVID-19 and getting all this power, who then owns a major position in four of the vaccines.
[00:36:19.584 --> 00:36:20.304]  So does Bill Gates.
[00:36:20.304 --> 00:36:21.165]  He owns a bigger position.
[00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.771]  I mean, he has a motive.
[00:36:23.771 --> 00:36:24.651]  He has a conflict of interest.
[00:36:24.651 --> 00:36:26.251]  He has a long history of cover-ups.
[00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:27.112]  They did cover-up.
[00:36:27.112 --> 00:36:27.892]  They ran the lab.
[00:36:27.892 --> 00:36:29.433]  They funded the gain of function.
[00:36:29.433 --> 00:36:35.935]  The only question is, did he do it on purpose?
[00:36:35.935 --> 00:36:40.136]  That's like asking, did I get in bed with my wife and make my four-year-old daughter four and a half years ago?
[00:36:40.136 --> 00:36:43.657]  I mean, you know, I mean, come on, folks.
[00:36:43.657 --> 00:36:44.297]  It's ridiculous.
[00:36:44.297 --> 00:36:46.338]  Of course they did it on purpose.
[00:36:46.338 --> 00:36:48.079]  They just think we're too stupid to do anything about it.
[00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:49.439]  Well, let's show them they're wrong.
[00:36:50.786 --> 00:36:57.112]  Yankees suffer COVID resurgence as eight fully vaccinated players test positive.
[00:36:57.112 --> 00:36:59.594]  But no one will say the PCR test is fake.
[00:36:59.594 --> 00:37:00.875]  Just the inventor of it.
[00:37:00.875 --> 00:37:01.956]  Just all the studies.
[00:37:01.956 --> 00:37:03.498]  Just mainstream news.
[00:37:03.498 --> 00:37:06.941]  94% of PCR tests are false positive, New York Times!
[00:37:09.051 --> 00:37:14.839]  But oh no, we just have to shut down the, shut up, oh my god, it's all a little computer.
[00:37:14.839 --> 00:37:16.982]  Oh, have computers run society.
[00:37:16.982 --> 00:37:18.364]  That's an old Zeitgeist movement.
[00:37:18.364 --> 00:37:22.790]  They'll decide what job you have and how much money you have, but who programs the computer?
[00:37:24.773 --> 00:37:30.598]  Woman forced to wear a mask during childbirth suffered vomiting, panic attacks, breathing difficulties.
[00:37:30.598 --> 00:37:31.799]  InfoWars.com.
[00:37:31.799 --> 00:37:36.263]  Even though it's not recommended in the UK, all the virtue signalers made them do it.
[00:37:36.263 --> 00:37:39.005]  Yes, suffocate the mother while she has the baby.
[00:37:39.005 --> 00:37:40.567]  Wrap him in plastic when she hugs him.
[00:37:40.567 --> 00:37:41.828]  You're dirty, you're bad.
[00:37:41.828 --> 00:37:43.970]  No breast milk!
[00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.653]  Only formula shrink that baby's brain.
[00:37:47.653 --> 00:37:50.835]  Biden, get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do.
[00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:51.336]  And then, oh,
[00:37:52.276 --> 00:37:55.177]  Companies are now saying, we want to see a vaccine passport before you come in.
[00:37:55.177 --> 00:37:59.438]  And the FBI says, oh, if we catch you with a fake card saying you have the shot, we'll arrest you.
[00:37:59.438 --> 00:38:01.838]  And that's not even in law that they can do that.
[00:38:01.838 --> 00:38:03.459]  But that's what they're setting up.
[00:38:03.459 --> 00:38:05.659]  Disgusting.
[00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:09.280]  Woke Harry laments genetic pain of upbringing.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.021]  Brands First Amendment bonkers.
[00:38:12.021 --> 00:38:16.842]  So this little royal snot-nosed woke punk.
[00:38:16.842 --> 00:38:17.742]  I'm going to read more of this later.
[00:38:17.742 --> 00:38:19.663]  He actually says, white people are bad.
[00:38:21.076 --> 00:38:23.418]  And that white people are the reason we have a First Amendment?
[00:38:23.418 --> 00:38:25.399]  I mean, it's bonkers, man.
[00:38:25.399 --> 00:38:27.161]  Totally bonkers.
[00:38:27.161 --> 00:38:30.744]  What's behind the trauma of taking off masks, CNN?
[00:38:30.744 --> 00:38:37.789]  The trauma of removing your filth binky, says the creepy-behaved and creepy-looking Brian Stelter.
[00:38:38.502 --> 00:38:48.130]  America's unmasking brings liberation, but also trepidation as huge questions loom as we're taught to be hysterical about germs.
[00:38:48.130 --> 00:39:00.180]  And so now just every cold, every flu is a, oh, you go get COVID tested and you're false positive and your company shuts down and the school shuts down and we're all just in fear and erotic messes forever!
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.501]  All China runs giant death camps.
[00:39:03.598 --> 00:39:06.600]  But there are big worldwide events against that, I'll tell you about later.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.622]  Protests this weekend against the mask, but just go out and protest it, point out it's a fraud.
[00:39:10.622 --> 00:39:17.467]  Don't just let them ease off a little, then our opposition goes away and then they build it up later.
[00:39:17.467 --> 00:39:19.528]  You have to keep pushing now for Fauci to be arrested.
[00:39:19.528 --> 00:39:24.211]  You have to keep pushing for gays to be brought to justice, because they're already going to bring in phase 2 and phase 3 and phase 4.
[00:39:24.211 --> 00:39:30.175]  They already have in Australia and New Zealand and in Canada where they have some servient people that they know they can abuse.
[00:39:30.888 --> 00:39:36.269]  Where they have prime ministers that say, I want a Chinese dictatorship in my country.
[00:39:36.269 --> 00:39:37.130]  Like Canada.
[00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.190]  They're monsters!
[00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.070]  They're doing it!
[00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:40.150]  It happened again!
[00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.731]  Worldwide corporate tyranny through puppet governments!
[00:39:42.731 --> 00:39:48.153]  With China and its nightmare system as the model!
[00:39:48.153 --> 00:39:52.074]  World's leading scientists say the WHO's covering up what really happened and where it came from.
[00:39:52.074 --> 00:39:54.134]  And it goes on and on.
[00:39:54.134 --> 00:39:57.055]  Mass vaccination sites sit empty throughout America.
[00:40:00.399 --> 00:40:04.686]  I want to hit the colonial pipeline and how that's clearly a globalist test and why they test that way.
[00:40:04.686 --> 00:40:09.914]  And I do want to get to these clips I've been mentioning in earnest but haven't gotten to.
[00:40:09.914 --> 00:40:11.637]  But let me just throw this out there very quickly.
[00:40:12.324 --> 00:40:14.226]  You have commodity prices going to all-time highs.
[00:40:14.226 --> 00:40:17.668]  You have food price index increases, the biggest in history now.
[00:40:17.668 --> 00:40:21.111]  You have Biden saying $4 trillion spending package.
[00:40:21.111 --> 00:40:23.313]  You've got Europe doing it, China doing it.
[00:40:23.313 --> 00:40:28.837]  They are inflating the currency, and they're on their way to Zimbabwe levels or Weimar Republic levels.
[00:40:28.837 --> 00:40:39.566]  If I was you, one of the smartest things you can do is get high-quality, storable food to freeze the price now that lasts for many years and is high quality, so no matter what happens, you've got insurance you can eat.
[00:40:39.566 --> 00:40:42.028]  Now, the food prices are going to go up in a couple weeks, they've told me.
[00:40:42.694 --> 00:40:46.657]  Well, instead of them going up, we had them go down to last year's prices, 10% off.
[00:40:46.657 --> 00:40:48.559]  But that had to end on Wednesday.
[00:40:48.559 --> 00:40:50.901]  I got it extended to Sunday, and then that is it.
[00:40:50.901 --> 00:40:56.966]  PrepareWithAlex.com, RimfulWarStore.com, 10% off on six-month, three-month, year supply, everything, 10% off.
[00:40:58.977 --> 00:41:13.806]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the East Coast gasoline pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast.
[00:41:13.806 --> 00:41:22.951]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and sent to the East Coast?
[00:41:23.331 --> 00:41:23.912]  That's right.
[00:41:23.912 --> 00:41:28.776]  Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed.
[00:41:28.776 --> 00:41:30.958]  Joe Biden did that to America.
[00:41:30.958 --> 00:41:32.059]  He has the history.
[00:41:32.059 --> 00:41:33.020]  He has the background.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:36.443]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[00:41:36.443 --> 00:41:39.806]  He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdown of the country.
[00:41:40.546 --> 00:41:44.869]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world.
[00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:50.012]  And they want the United States, Europe, and Australia crippled so Communist China can be dominant.
[00:41:50.012 --> 00:41:51.993]  It's not Russia that's the enemy.
[00:41:51.993 --> 00:41:56.555]  It's Communist China and their minions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[00:41:56.555 --> 00:41:57.416]  That's the facts.
[00:41:57.416 --> 00:41:58.797]  That's the information.
[00:41:58.797 --> 00:42:04.780]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything.
[00:42:06.463 --> 00:42:10.366]  Has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.

[00:42:46.533 --> 00:42:47.935]  Listeners thought I was joking.
[00:42:47.935 --> 00:42:50.237]  You've tried it out and most of you have been blown away.

[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.021]  Ultimate Fish Oil.

[00:42:55.222 --> 00:42:56.163]  Ultimate Fish Oil.

[00:42:59.955 --> 00:43:04.958]  People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year?
[00:43:04.958 --> 00:43:13.163]  Because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year, it's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution.
[00:43:13.163 --> 00:43:16.285]  And not just that, fuel and every other major commodity.
[00:43:16.545 --> 00:43:18.646]  The globalists want a post-industrial world.
[00:43:18.646 --> 00:43:20.448]  They're hitting us with economic war.
[00:43:20.448 --> 00:43:22.009]  I told you food prices would explode.
[00:43:22.009 --> 00:43:23.149]  They're now exploding.
[00:43:23.149 --> 00:43:26.111]  Our great sponsor, MyPatriot, has barely gone up in price.
[00:43:26.111 --> 00:43:29.894]  Their competitors have gone up even more, but they're about to go up in two weeks.
[00:43:29.894 --> 00:43:36.258]  But instead of just holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening, and then it's got to go up.
[00:43:36.258 --> 00:43:38.019]  10% off at infowarestore.com.
[00:43:38.599 --> 00:43:39.480]  We're good to go!
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.260]  We're good to go!
[00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:07.371]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:14.173]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[00:44:14.173 --> 00:44:21.175]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[00:44:21.175 --> 00:44:25.736]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:27.958]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[00:44:27.958 --> 00:44:30.560]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.402]  Say goodbye to septic problems.
[00:44:32.402 --> 00:44:34.944]  Gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[00:44:34.944 --> 00:44:39.228]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[00:44:39.228 --> 00:44:46.855]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times better.
[00:44:47.535 --> 00:44:49.637]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:45:18.608 --> 00:45:46.110]  No one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes No one knows what it's like To be hated To be faded To telling only lies
[00:45:47.859 --> 00:46:04.151]  But my dreams they aren't as empty as my conscience seems to be.
[00:46:04.151 --> 00:46:09.475]  I have hours only lonely.
[00:46:09.475 --> 00:46:11.136]  My love is vengeance.
[00:46:11.136 --> 00:46:13.237]  My love is vengeance.
[00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:15.059]  It's never free.
[00:46:15.059 --> 00:46:15.739]  That's never
[00:46:17.446 --> 00:46:19.628]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:19.628 --> 00:46:23.111]  All right, let me go over all this unbelievable news.
[00:46:23.111 --> 00:46:46.890]  To watch this cult study psychological warfare, to have the Stanford, and to have the UT, and to have the Cambridge, and to have the Harvard and Yale studies, and Rockefeller and Carnegie Endowment studies on how to launch the attack, how to scare everybody, how to lock things down, and to see the Rockefeller Foundation head promoted to run these operations for Biden,
[00:46:47.535 --> 00:46:52.699]  To see the Carnegie head put to the head of the CIA.
[00:46:52.699 --> 00:47:01.727]  We're really seeing the shadow foundations that have run the country since the 20s come into full power worldwide, not just here.
[00:47:01.727 --> 00:47:05.470]  And they are post-humanist.
[00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:13.956]  They believe in the end of the human age, they are Luciferians, active practitioners.
[00:47:13.956 --> 00:47:16.959]  They believe that they're about to bring in the one world leader, Lucifer,
[00:47:17.697 --> 00:47:20.258]  That will help them transcend their human bodies.
[00:47:20.258 --> 00:47:23.300]  Of course, Arthur C. Clarke was one of them.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.442]  They wrote many books that continue to put that message forward.
[00:47:26.442 --> 00:47:29.564]  But that is what we're facing, total extermination.
[00:47:29.564 --> 00:47:32.905]  They are working with an entity that seeks our destruction.
[00:47:32.905 --> 00:47:34.847]  That's what they believe.
[00:47:34.847 --> 00:47:36.167]  And they laugh at me.
[00:47:36.167 --> 00:47:39.729]  They think I've chosen the wrong side.
[00:47:39.729 --> 00:47:41.950]  And they seem sure of themselves.
[00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:44.912]  So, you notice no one's laughing about the sound.
[00:47:44.912 --> 00:47:46.433]  Everybody at a spiritual level
[00:47:47.057 --> 00:47:48.298]  Understand what's going on.
[00:47:48.298 --> 00:47:49.958]  I mean, look at their front man.
[00:47:49.958 --> 00:47:56.381]  Look at this dead husk of a creature, this mummy, this stuffed skin.
[00:47:56.381 --> 00:48:14.430]  It's the skin of an old dead man filled with the cabbage leaves that is Joe Biden saying you've earned the right to show your face by submitting to martial law and hen pecking and dangerous genetically engineered concoctions
[00:48:15.489 --> 00:48:19.112]  Paid for and developed by a man that says he wants to kill you, named Bill Gates.
[00:48:19.112 --> 00:48:20.393]  Here it is.
[00:48:20.393 --> 00:48:25.777]  You know, some may say, just feel more comfortable.
[00:48:25.777 --> 00:48:27.238]  Continue to wear a mask.
[00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:29.060]  They may feel that way.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:35.745]  So, if you're someone with a mask, you see them, please treat them with kindness and respect.
[00:48:35.745 --> 00:48:42.690]  We've had too much conflict, too much bitterness, too much anger, too much politicization of this issue about wearing masks.
[00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.332]  Let's put it to rest.
[00:48:46.332 --> 00:48:49.713]  Let's remember we're all Americans.
[00:48:49.713 --> 00:48:54.736]  Let's remember that we are all in this together.
[00:48:54.736 --> 00:49:06.663]  If you're fully vaccinated and can take your mask off, you've earned the right to do something that Americans are known for all around the world.
[00:49:06.663 --> 00:49:09.624]  Greeting others with a smile.
[00:49:09.624 --> 00:49:10.325]  With a smile.
[00:49:13.658 --> 00:49:19.742]  There are so many lies just in that 42 seconds that I could spend an hour on them.
[00:49:19.742 --> 00:49:23.444]  But did you catch it all?
[00:49:23.444 --> 00:49:28.787]  Truly, truly nightmarish.
[00:49:28.787 --> 00:49:30.968]  This is how it works.
[00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:35.351]  Barack Obama would come out and say, we need unity and racial love.
[00:49:35.351 --> 00:49:37.052]  And everybody's like, yeah, oh, he's a good guy.
[00:49:37.052 --> 00:49:38.253]  Well, all his surrogates
[00:49:39.039 --> 00:49:44.845]  And his people, Van Jones and all of them, created racial division and said whites were inherently bad.
[00:49:44.845 --> 00:49:53.735]  And now you see that on steroids because Obama can hide behind his puppet Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.
[00:49:53.735 --> 00:49:54.936]  Obama created division.
[00:49:54.936 --> 00:49:55.617]  That was his job.
[00:49:55.617 --> 00:49:56.558]  That's what the globalists want.
[00:49:57.785 --> 00:50:01.468]  But then, oh, Obama or Biden, they get up and like, oh, come on.
[00:50:01.468 --> 00:50:04.170]  You've had enough problems with the mask and all this.
[00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:04.870]  Enough division.
[00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:06.051]  Let's come together.
[00:50:06.051 --> 00:50:07.432]  I'm letting you take it off now.
[00:50:07.432 --> 00:50:08.793]  Which he shouldn't have that power.
[00:50:08.793 --> 00:50:09.734]  He doesn't have that power.
[00:50:09.734 --> 00:50:10.754]  It's a usurpation.
[00:50:10.754 --> 00:50:11.575]  It's a fraud.
[00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:22.983]  And they're cementing that power that your Islamic lord, it's like the husband of a wife, and he tells her when she can take the burqa off, and he says when she puts the burqa back on.
[00:50:22.983 --> 00:50:25.505]  Or like a pimp.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.582]  Tells a woman how much money she gets to keep from each job she's with.
[00:50:29.582 --> 00:50:31.643]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:50:31.643 --> 00:50:32.464]  This is crazy.
[00:50:32.464 --> 00:50:34.665]  This isn't liberal, like more freedom.
[00:50:34.665 --> 00:50:36.826]  This is authoritarianism.
[00:50:36.826 --> 00:50:40.228]  And it's all based on lies.
[00:50:40.228 --> 00:50:43.010]  And you talk to a lot of this and you go, hey, the vaccine doesn't protect you.
[00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:44.051]  Hey, it's experimental.
[00:50:44.051 --> 00:50:47.252]  Hey, these studies that Fauci funded said it gives people heart attacks.
[00:50:47.252 --> 00:50:48.673]  Shut up, you don't know science.
[00:50:48.673 --> 00:50:50.815]  You're not a scientist.
[00:50:50.815 --> 00:50:52.415]  Well, I interviewed like 20 of them.
[00:50:52.415 --> 00:50:53.636]  Shut up, they need to be censored.
[00:50:53.636 --> 00:50:54.657]  They're a bunch of kooks too.
[00:50:57.103 --> 00:50:57.984]  I love the FBI!
[00:50:57.984 --> 00:50:58.804]  I love the CIA!
[00:50:58.804 --> 00:50:59.544]  I'm a liberal!
[00:50:59.544 --> 00:51:00.525]  I love war!
[00:51:00.525 --> 00:51:01.406]  I love torture!
[00:51:01.406 --> 00:51:02.126]  I love, I love!
[00:51:02.126 --> 00:51:04.647]  Because you pretend you're part of the power structure.
[00:51:04.647 --> 00:51:06.428]  They're pathetic people.
[00:51:06.428 --> 00:51:07.369]  But let's move on from them.
[00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:12.912]  It's those of us that understand we have to mobilize against them.
[00:51:12.912 --> 00:51:13.813]  Here's CNN.
[00:51:13.813 --> 00:51:22.137]  Unvaccinated children will need to wear masks when playing and particularly indoors, says Dr. Fauci, who's been involved in all sorts of crime.
[00:51:22.137 --> 00:51:23.278]  He's invested in the vaccines.
[00:51:24.139 --> 00:51:33.923]  Conflict of interest, he's making money off of it, he's involved in the cover-up, he lies to Congress, says he didn't fund Gain of Function when they've released the receipts for millions of dollars that he did?
[00:51:33.923 --> 00:51:35.924]  My God!
[00:51:35.924 --> 00:51:42.287]  But he says, and the left follows him and the school boards follow him, muzzling your children.
[00:51:42.287 --> 00:51:52.371]  It's not enough they put him on Ritalin and Prozac and all these drugs are in such a cult, but now they gotta wear a mask in the public schools with all the spoiled communists and leftists that teach at them.
[00:51:54.725 --> 00:51:58.187]  Everybody bows to political correctness, so the left will leave us alone.
[00:51:58.187 --> 00:52:00.749]  They don't leave us alone when you bow.
[00:52:00.749 --> 00:52:05.612]  They always want more, more, more, because they're the corporate ideology to take the planet over.
[00:52:05.612 --> 00:52:11.355]  They're gonna make your child get sterilized.
[00:52:11.355 --> 00:52:14.257]  It's not about gay rights, it's about exterminism.
[00:52:14.257 --> 00:52:17.899]  It's about, that's the cult of the New World Order, is sex.
[00:52:17.899 --> 00:52:22.022]  To control people, and to get in our bedrooms, and to obsess over it.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:27.302]  Tucker Carlson talked about it last night, when they're teaching pedophilia in the public schools!
[00:52:27.302 --> 00:52:32.645]  Because it's about killing the youth and their future!
[00:52:32.645 --> 00:52:34.405]  So here's Fauci on CNN.
[00:52:34.405 --> 00:52:43.050]  What is your message to parents who are out there thinking, well, I'm vaccinated, my kids are not, but the odds of them getting the virus are very low.
[00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:45.631]  Would you tell them, no, no, no, the kids still need to wear a mask?
[00:52:46.886 --> 00:52:54.793]  Yeah, the children do when they're out there playing with their friends and, you know, particularly in an indoor situation, they do.
[00:52:54.793 --> 00:53:04.601]  But, you know, one of the things that's also important that's happened most recently is the approval of vaccines for children 12 to 15 years old.
[00:53:04.601 --> 00:53:10.406]  And then we are also doing studies now in an age de-escalation from 12 to 9, 9 to 6, 6 to 2, and then 6 months to 2 years.
[00:53:13.408 --> 00:53:18.552]  So that we'll be able, hopefully by the end of the year, to be able to vaccinate children of any age.
[00:53:18.552 --> 00:53:24.576]  But right now, the 12 to 15 year olds are eligible to get vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:53:24.576 --> 00:53:28.119]  So that's another good news story in all this.
[00:53:28.119 --> 00:53:37.266]  So you can't, just like Biden actually said in his speech, you can't take the mask off, whether you're two years old or 50, until you've taken the so-called vaccine.
[00:53:37.266 --> 00:53:40.608]  I mean, this is a total nightmare takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:42.122 --> 00:53:43.524]  I've got another Fauci clip here.
[00:53:43.524 --> 00:53:45.147]  Fauci throwback.
[00:53:45.147 --> 00:53:48.652]  We will vaccinate school-age children and six-month-old babies.
[00:53:48.652 --> 00:53:49.534]  You know, he just said it.
[00:53:49.534 --> 00:53:50.876]  You don't need to hear it again.
[00:53:50.876 --> 00:53:52.058]  But these people are out of control.
[00:53:53.442 --> 00:53:56.145]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk about a couple things here with you.
[00:53:56.145 --> 00:54:02.131]  I'm extremely excited about new ionized fizzy magnesium naturally flavored orange drink.
[00:54:02.131 --> 00:54:04.052]  This has two different types of magnesium.
[00:54:04.052 --> 00:54:05.974]  For some reason, the other competitors don't.
[00:54:05.974 --> 00:54:08.357]  It makes a really wonderful type of magnesium.
[00:54:08.357 --> 00:54:11.219]  I already love magnesium drinks, but I forget to take them.
[00:54:11.219 --> 00:54:12.601]  I really feel the loss of energy.
[00:54:13.241 --> 00:54:13.661]  We're good to go.
[00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:40.417]  We got a big shipment of it in, so it's $19.95 per canister, and a second canister for $14.95, and that funds our operation.
[00:54:40.417 --> 00:54:41.598]  We're extremely proud of it.
[00:54:41.598 --> 00:54:44.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.342]  We're also going to have to end, not this Sunday, but next Sunday, because it's selling out.
[00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:50.105]  We're good to go.
[00:55:13.078 --> 00:55:15.259]  Preparewithalex.com or infowarshore.com.
[00:55:15.259 --> 00:55:18.321]  You can find the sub page because my Patreon has their own sub site on us.
[00:55:18.321 --> 00:55:19.182]  It's just their back end.
[00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:20.583]  It's their full catalog.
[00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:23.704]  You always get the lowest prices they're offering, but I'm their biggest distributor.
[00:55:23.704 --> 00:55:26.886]  You know the biggest company now in the U.S., probably the world, Trouble Food.
[00:55:26.886 --> 00:55:29.588]  I'm still their biggest distributor, biggest one seller.
[00:55:29.588 --> 00:55:32.130]  I get 10% off when nobody else is selling at that.
[00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:33.811]  Makes some of their other people mad, but I mean, come on.
[00:55:33.811 --> 00:55:35.291]  I'm not in competition with those other distributors.
[00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:36.012]  This is to my audience.
[00:55:36.613 --> 00:55:38.515]  And we've extended it until Sunday night, and then that's it.
[00:55:38.515 --> 00:55:42.698]  And then they're going up in food prices in two weeks after that, because everybody else says they have to.
[00:55:42.698 --> 00:55:43.678]  It's just skyrocketing.
[00:55:43.678 --> 00:55:47.781]  So get last year's prices now before food prices go up again.
[00:55:47.781 --> 00:55:49.363]  They're still a great deal.
[00:55:49.363 --> 00:55:55.547]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[00:55:55.547 --> 00:56:03.994]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[00:56:04.915 --> 00:56:16.562]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[00:56:16.562 --> 00:56:21.685]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[00:56:21.685 --> 00:56:25.728]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[00:56:25.728 --> 00:56:30.731]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[00:56:32.618 --> 00:56:35.520]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:45.224]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:56:49.833 --> 00:56:51.374]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:52.134]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:56:52.134 --> 00:56:52.894]  Trying to move quicker.
[00:56:52.894 --> 00:56:53.715]  Hey, Alex.
[00:56:53.715 --> 00:56:54.155]  Welcome.
[00:56:54.155 --> 00:56:59.317]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[00:56:59.317 --> 00:57:02.698]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[00:57:02.698 --> 00:57:09.161]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[00:57:09.161 --> 00:57:10.822]  Living Defense saved my life.
[00:57:10.822 --> 00:57:14.983]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[00:57:14.983 --> 00:57:16.424]  Living Defense brought me back.
[00:57:16.704 --> 00:57:22.227]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[00:57:22.227 --> 00:57:24.628]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[00:57:24.628 --> 00:57:33.932]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[00:57:33.932 --> 00:57:39.354]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[00:57:39.354 --> 00:57:40.895]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[00:57:41.095 --> 00:57:52.810]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:55.434]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:02.173 --> 00:58:03.614]  All right, we're into hour number two.
[00:58:03.614 --> 00:58:08.379]  Some stations don't carry this short segment, so I'm going to just play a special report that I want to analyze.
[00:58:08.379 --> 00:58:16.506]  And then Joe Hoffman with undoubtedly, there's been a lot of big news, the biggest news yet on the stolen election of 2020 and where that's going.
[00:58:16.506 --> 00:58:20.330]  Just unbelievable developments and the tip of the spear from gatewaypundit.com on that.
[00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:24.954]  But I happened last night to be surfing YouTube and I came across the CBS News report
[00:58:25.618 --> 00:58:28.461]  That made me physically ill to watch, but it still has to be seen.
[00:58:28.461 --> 00:58:29.462]  I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[00:58:29.462 --> 00:58:30.683]  It's like five minutes long.
[00:58:30.683 --> 00:58:33.066]  We'll play about three and a half minutes of it here.
[00:58:33.066 --> 00:58:36.810]  And I'll give you the title of it if you want to go on YouTube and watch the whole thing.
[00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:41.675]  Town with one COVID-19 case still facing crippling effects of pandemic.
[00:58:41.675 --> 00:58:45.079]  No, crippling effects of being under siege under martial law.
[00:58:46.013 --> 00:58:57.203]  Canada doesn't even let people basically go outside there, but it also borders the US, so this woman can't go see her family, and they won't let her across to see her dentist, and she puts up with it!
[00:58:57.203 --> 00:59:01.126]  So again, and people watch this on the news around the world, think this is normal.
[00:59:01.126 --> 00:59:06.310]  The martial law in Canada, the martial law in Australia, it's BS!
[00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:11.495]  And they're using it for total control, and for surveillance, so...
[00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:19.698]  Here is just a great window into Stockholm Syndrome and what happens when women follow the every order of the state.
[00:59:20.973 --> 00:59:24.936]  Canada could decide any day now if it will reopen its U.S.
[00:59:24.936 --> 00:59:30.780]  border or extend the more-than-year-long shutdown because of the continuing pandemic.
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:35.583]  Point Roberts, Washington, in particular, has been hard- By the way, hit pause again.
[00:59:35.583 --> 00:59:36.864]  Hit pause again.
[00:59:36.864 --> 00:59:38.125]  Just back up to the beginning.
[00:59:38.125 --> 00:59:39.766]  Again, it's not the pandemic.
[00:59:39.766 --> 00:59:41.667]  It's not an ongoing pandemic.
[00:59:41.667 --> 00:59:45.690]  London hasn't had one COVID death in a couple weeks, and it's still locked down, basically.
[00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:46.791]  It's all lies!
[00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:48.111]  It's a power grab!
[00:59:48.111 --> 00:59:49.452]  Telling you you're not essential!
[00:59:49.452 --> 00:59:50.053]  Good—sorry.
[00:59:50.793 --> 00:59:51.354]  Here's the report.
[00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:53.795]  This is how Pamela Robertson sees family during
[01:00:19.275 --> 01:00:21.577]  As far as I'm concerned, it's essential.
[01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:24.019]  As far as I'm concerned, they should let me in.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:51.310]  But Pamela was turned away by Canadian border guards when she tried to see her dentist about an abscess, an infection that caused the side of her face to swell and could turn into a serious health risk if left untreated.
[01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:59.998]  I asked him what was essential in their eyes and he said to me, unfortunately you have to be like dying.
[01:01:01.192 --> 01:01:08.177]  She lives in Point Roberts, a small picturesque seaside town of about 1,100 with sweeping views.
[01:01:08.177 --> 01:01:13.560]  Pre-COVID, it would quadruple in size every summer as Canadians flock south of the border.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.142]  Point Roberts is a bit of a geographical oddity.
[01:01:16.142 --> 01:01:19.825]  Lying just south of the 49th parallel, it is a U.S.
[01:01:19.825 --> 01:01:25.529]  exclave, part of Washington State but completely disconnected from the U.S.
[01:01:25.529 --> 01:01:29.751]  So to get to a dentist, Pamela has to cross the border.
[01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:30.092]  Are you
[01:01:31.269 --> 01:01:31.849]  Frustrated?
[01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:32.870]  Are you angry?
[01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:37.413]  I can't be angry because I know that the country is trying their best to keep COVID at bay.
[01:01:37.413 --> 01:01:39.815]  I'm just frustrated with the system.
[01:01:39.815 --> 01:01:46.760]  While COVID remains a major concern in neighboring British Columbia, Point Roberts has had only one case in more than a year.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.703]  Still, this small community has been locked out of essential needs.
[01:01:50.703 --> 01:01:52.104]  There's no full-time doctor.
[01:01:52.104 --> 01:01:53.124]  There's no dentist.
[01:01:53.124 --> 01:01:54.445]  There's no veterinarian.
[01:01:54.445 --> 01:01:55.486]  There's not even a pharmacy.
[01:01:56.272 --> 01:02:02.477]  You can see why the people who call Point Roberts home are worried it could become a COVID ghost town.
[01:02:02.477 --> 01:02:05.139]  I had six customers on Sunday.
[01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:08.701]  How does that compare to a normal Sunday before COVID?
[01:02:08.701 --> 01:02:13.705]  I would have upwards of 30, 40, 60.
[01:02:13.705 --> 01:02:19.689]  Yeah, I flew up there three and a half years ago on a seaplane out of Seattle.
[01:02:19.689 --> 01:02:21.991]  Beautiful, super gorgeous part of the U.S.
[01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:22.651]  right by Canada.
[01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:23.532]  Look at the Orca whales.
[01:02:24.275 --> 01:02:25.096]  Totally shut down.
[01:02:25.096 --> 01:02:25.956]  They all wear their masks.
[01:02:25.956 --> 01:02:27.378]  They all submit.
[01:02:27.378 --> 01:02:30.960]  So you're never going to reopen, honey, until you go bankrupt a couple years from now.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.102]  Then the globals will come by your property.
[01:02:33.102 --> 01:02:34.803]  They engineer these collabs all over the world.
[01:02:34.803 --> 01:02:35.504]  They brag about it.
[01:02:35.504 --> 01:02:37.125]  Klaus Schwab brags.
[01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:38.046]  Stop submitting.
[01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:40.288]  You're just whining on CBS.
[01:02:40.288 --> 01:02:42.289]  They're all part of the problem.
[01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:43.550]  So you want to be a slave?
[01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.111]  You want to go bankrupt?
[01:02:45.111 --> 01:02:48.734]  You want to go, I understand they want to keep COVID at bay.
[01:02:48.734 --> 01:02:50.716]  COVID's the excuse for tyranny, sweetheart.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.594]  Coma's the excuse for making you obsolete.
[01:02:53.594 --> 01:02:54.178]  Comprende?
[01:02:58.476 --> 01:03:04.580]  Two weeks ago, I launched a sale on all the high-quality, storable foods at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:15.487]  And I pointed out that the Bloomberg Global Food Index shows that current crop purchases being made for the end of the summer, when the crops are completed, around the world, is up 76%.
[01:03:15.487 --> 01:03:18.429]  That alone will cause civil unrest and major problems.
[01:03:18.429 --> 01:03:22.812]  Since the inflation has exploded in the last two weeks, you've seen the pipeline crises.
[01:03:22.812 --> 01:03:26.174]  You've seen Governor Whitmer shutting down or trying to shut down the pipeline in Michigan.
[01:03:26.174 --> 01:03:27.415]  This is a concerted operation.
[01:03:27.615 --> 01:03:33.977]  And so, Lister's had a huge response to our big sale, 2020 prices, in the year 2021.
[01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.238]  10% off all storable foods, preparewithalex.com.
[01:03:36.238 --> 01:03:42.980]  Now, the sale ended yesterday, so I'm now, I think there's a lot of requests, extending it through Sunday, and that it absolutely has to end.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:50.102]  So, one month, three months, six months, your supplies, highest quality water filters, and so much more, preparewithalex.com.
[01:03:50.102 --> 01:03:54.303]  It's the best deal you're going to find on high quality storable food for you and your family and your community.
[01:03:54.303 --> 01:03:55.864]  Get ready now, preparewithalex.com.
[01:04:13.728 --> 01:04:15.529]  We're good to go.
[01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:45.328]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two, and we have been living this incredible election fraud.
[01:04:46.059 --> 01:04:50.420]  Since it took place back on November 3rd, the Democrats pledged to challenge the election.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:55.441]  They said, it'll look like Trump wins that night, but we know the ballots are going to come in one way or another.
[01:04:55.441 --> 01:04:57.701]  He will be the president.
[01:04:57.701 --> 01:04:58.941]  That is Joe Biden.
[01:04:58.941 --> 01:05:01.642]  Joe Biden told people at speeches, he goes, I don't even need you to vote.
[01:05:01.642 --> 01:05:02.802]  I need you once I get in.
[01:05:02.802 --> 01:05:03.022]  Wow.
[01:05:03.022 --> 01:05:09.963]  What a strange statement, but I guess when you're that old and have Alzheimer's, you know, you, you, you, you start having that Veritas.
[01:05:09.963 --> 01:05:13.984]  They have Vino Veritas and I guess Alzheimer's based or dementia based.
[01:05:15.131 --> 01:05:16.432]  Veritas.
[01:05:16.432 --> 01:05:20.113]  And so here we are, and they've done the Maricopa County operation.
[01:05:20.113 --> 01:05:21.393]  You've seen them go crazy.
[01:05:21.393 --> 01:05:23.774]  Biden tried to block it with the Justice Department.
[01:05:23.774 --> 01:05:26.055]  And now they're reporting some incredible things.
[01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:29.416]  Trump has come out saying, yeah, looks like this proves they stole it.
[01:05:29.416 --> 01:05:32.118]  But what are they going to do once that evidence is fully certified?
[01:05:32.118 --> 01:05:33.378]  Now we've got breaking.
[01:05:33.378 --> 01:05:34.658]  GatewayPundit.com.
[01:05:34.658 --> 01:05:38.540]  Dominion Voting Systems released a statement
[01:05:39.404 --> 01:05:45.607]  Slams Arizona forensic audit and states company will not release passwords to Maricopa voting machines.
[01:05:45.607 --> 01:05:48.308]  That's Jim Hoth, owner, founder of Gateway Pundit.
[01:05:48.308 --> 01:05:52.870]  We have his brother that's a forensic fraud investigator who's really the expert joining us.
[01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:57.112]  Breaking significant discrepancies just covered in Arizona audit ballots.
[01:05:58.431 --> 01:05:58.791]  I think so.
[01:06:21.795 --> 01:06:24.957]  Continuation of the insurrection.
[01:06:24.957 --> 01:06:26.998]  That video of that.
[01:06:26.998 --> 01:06:30.599]  So joining us to lay out the latest developments is Joe Hoff.
[01:06:30.599 --> 01:06:32.420]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.562]  Yeah, it's great to be here, Alex.
[01:06:35.562 --> 01:06:37.983]  You really got your nose in the grindstone, so does your brother.
[01:06:37.983 --> 01:06:42.685]  I think that's the best place for overall accurate analysis.
[01:06:42.685 --> 01:06:44.286]  I mean, to me, this is the biggest news yet.
[01:06:44.286 --> 01:06:44.766]  What do you think?
[01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:48.371]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex.
[01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:51.694]  A lot going on in Arizona.
[01:06:51.694 --> 01:06:57.518]  And here's why we know it's one of the biggest things to hit, is because the DNC sent something like 100 or so attorneys down to
[01:07:02.242 --> 01:07:04.544]  Down to Arizona to try to stop this thing.
[01:07:04.544 --> 01:07:05.866]  Mark Elias is down there.
[01:07:05.866 --> 01:07:13.653]  He's been the instigator and the leader behind all the lawfare efforts to try to steal this election.
[01:07:13.653 --> 01:07:24.964]  He was successful in getting individuals to sign off on these insane rules concerning absentee ballots and drop boxes before the election when they didn't have the authority to do so.
[01:07:27.146 --> 01:07:34.331]  And we've seen a number of Republicans, like in Arizona, fight back against the audits, etc.
[01:07:34.331 --> 01:07:44.777]  So the big thing in Arizona is Maricopa County, and I'll just kind of give you a couple statistics about why it's so important there.
[01:07:44.777 --> 01:07:50.141]  Maricopa County is where Phoenix is located, and it's like 60% of the entire population in the state.
[01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:53.543]  And it's traditionally gone Republican.
[01:07:53.543 --> 01:07:57.086]  It's gone Republican since Harry Truman.
[01:07:57.086 --> 01:08:02.810]  And Joe Biden miraculously somehow won Maricopa County in this year's election.
[01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:13.898]  He ends up beating Trump by something like 40,000 or so votes in the county, which ended up allowing him to win the vote in Arizona by 10,000 votes.
[01:08:13.898 --> 01:08:18.221]  So first, the first Democrat to win Maricopa since Truman.
[01:08:18.641 --> 01:08:24.844]  The first Democrats win Arizona since maybe one of the Clinton years.
[01:08:24.844 --> 01:08:31.367]  He had, Joe Biden had 150% of the total votes that Hillary did in Maricopa County.
[01:08:31.367 --> 01:08:34.709]  And of course, nobody believes that, not if they're being honest.
[01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:41.913]  Joe Biden was not more popular than Hillary Clinton and there was no enthusiasm behind Biden as well.
[01:08:41.913 --> 01:08:44.034]  We reported on this at the time.
[01:08:44.034 --> 01:08:57.862]  There was a event that Biden and Harris held in Phoenix like three weeks before the election and a local newscast woman is there and she's saying, this is really weird.
[01:08:57.862 --> 01:09:02.704]  I'm across the street from where Biden and Harris are and the parking lot's empty.
[01:09:02.704 --> 01:09:03.685]  Nobody's there.
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.161]  And that was Biden.
[01:09:06.161 --> 01:09:21.572]  And yet that at that same time period, a 95 mile long Trump car parade was created over a weekend, a couple of weeks before the election, not related to the party, not related to the Trump campaign.
[01:09:21.572 --> 01:09:25.495]  It was just individuals in Arizona that were behind Trump.
[01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:28.697]  95 mile long car parade.
[01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:29.938]  And they're telling us.
[01:09:30.718 --> 01:09:38.113]  That Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in Maricopa County, the first Democrat since the 1940s.
[01:09:39.628 --> 01:09:41.169]  It is an absolute lie.
[01:09:41.169 --> 01:09:45.390]  So we know just looking at the big numbers, this doesn't make any sense.
[01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:49.472]  And I'll compare this to my, you know, use my auditor hat.
[01:09:49.472 --> 01:09:54.154]  And you know, Alex, I've mentioned before, I've done hundreds of audits around the world.
[01:09:54.154 --> 01:09:56.955]  I was stationed in Hong Kong for 10 years.
[01:09:56.955 --> 01:10:00.577]  I got a background in corporate finance, etc.
[01:10:00.577 --> 01:10:07.840]  And one thing I've raised on this show before, too, Alex, as you remember, is the major failing and actually
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:20.405]  The accomplice that not just the big media was in this deal and big tech, but our justice system, because they did nothing as incident after incident after incident occurred.
[01:10:20.405 --> 01:10:28.828]  And in the corporate world, I mentioned this before, Alex, if there's just a fraud of $1 or $5 million, it goes straight to the top.
[01:10:28.828 --> 01:10:30.889]  It goes to the audit committee of the corporation.
[01:10:31.329 --> 01:10:47.336]  There's a mandate that it's discussed, it's talked about, what's happened needs to be defined and resolution has to be put in place such that the top people in the corporation are confident this won't happen again.
[01:10:47.336 --> 01:10:48.176]  That's just with
[01:10:49.085 --> 01:10:50.166]  Minor things are fraud.
[01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:50.967]  We saw so much fraud.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.101]  To his rallies.
[01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:11.685]  He didn't get 9 million more votes than Obama or all of this.
[01:11:11.685 --> 01:11:13.566]  It's pure bull.
[01:11:13.566 --> 01:11:33.244]  So expanding on that, now that this is coming out and they've tried to block it, what do you predict is going to happen though when they show the proof of this fraud, which mirrors the fraud that you and others discovered the same pattern in the other battleground states, that when the polls closed, Trump was winning by much bigger numbers than four years ago.
[01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:46.028]  Yeah, and like in Arizona, these people that were there on site, one woman there was under testimony, under oath, swore that she's telling the truth in front of Ruby Giuliani, says, hey, Dominion was running this show.
[01:11:46.028 --> 01:11:49.049]  Nothing happened without Dominion there telling us what to do.
[01:11:49.049 --> 01:11:52.591]  She said they were the ones doing the adjudication.
[01:11:52.591 --> 01:11:55.872]  And at times she thought, I think they were the only ones there doing it.
[01:11:55.872 --> 01:12:00.935]  And what that means, and here's something that I reported on, and this was what was noted this week in Arizona.
[01:12:01.435 --> 01:12:16.258]  Is that there's this adjudication ability in these machines that Dominion has built, and maybe others, the system, where if there's a ballot that's in question as far as who the person voted for, they go to this special person.
[01:12:16.258 --> 01:12:25.280]  It should be two people that look at the ballot and then make, you know, define what the correct answer was.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:34.783]  But these machines, they don't keep track of who made the decision, whether it was two people, and the date and time, etc.
[01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:37.864]  of each vote that goes to adjudication.
[01:12:37.864 --> 01:12:44.106]  Because that is missing in these systems, I believe they should never be used until that is fixed.
[01:12:44.106 --> 01:12:52.368]  Because we cannot have people, random people, making decisions on how somebody voted without there being controls in place to prevent that.
[01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:54.129]  So that's what we've written about.
[01:12:54.129 --> 01:12:54.789]  So what happens
[01:12:55.309 --> 01:13:05.096]  Two days ago, the Senate comes out with a report, and they had sent it to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, of which it's a majority Republican.
[01:13:05.096 --> 01:13:10.420]  And these are the same guys that have done everything they could to delay this audit, stop this audit.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.482]  Now they've got a hundred attorneys down there.
[01:13:13.482 --> 01:13:19.686]  And by the way, there's been letters coming from these major Democratic, what we call non-profits.
[01:13:20.206 --> 01:13:31.995]  Saying Democratic non-profit is an oxymoron because you cannot be Democrat or have an agenda, a political agenda, for one party or the other and be considered a non-profit.
[01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:33.956]  So that's happening all over the place.
[01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:36.558]  Republicans don't even touch that.
[01:13:36.558 --> 01:13:38.319]  It's massive fraud.
[01:13:38.319 --> 01:13:41.862]  But the letters are going to the DOJ even last week coming from
[01:13:42.562 --> 01:13:43.402]  Stay right there.
[01:13:43.402 --> 01:13:46.004]  Let's come back and talk about the latest developments.
[01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:46.804]  Stay there, please.
[01:13:46.804 --> 01:13:50.325]  Again, I don't like to lecture people.
[01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:56.888]  I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure.
[01:14:05.591 --> 01:14:09.673]  And we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[01:14:09.673 --> 01:14:13.634]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break.
[01:14:13.634 --> 01:14:15.015]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[01:14:15.015 --> 01:14:20.137]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[01:14:20.137 --> 01:14:20.537]  And I get it.
[01:14:20.537 --> 01:14:22.298]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[01:14:22.298 --> 01:14:24.459]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt.
[01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.831]  We're good to go.
[01:14:40.806 --> 01:14:42.668]  And so that's what InfoWars is really all about.
[01:14:42.668 --> 01:14:44.671]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.

[01:15:57.657 --> 01:16:01.121]  Fourteen months ago, I began to sit on the broadcast every day.
[01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:04.304]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[01:16:04.304 --> 01:16:16.177]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts, that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[01:16:16.177 --> 01:16:19.200]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:26.427]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[01:16:26.427 --> 01:16:29.570]  Plus the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down along with other pipelines.
[01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:33.053]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[01:16:33.053 --> 01:16:34.234]  We're being shut down.
[01:16:34.234 --> 01:16:36.276]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[01:16:36.276 --> 01:16:38.679]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[01:16:39.219 --> 01:16:40.600]  The third world is imploding as well.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:41.840]  The borders have been removed.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.722]  Until you wake up and this is a globalist TCHICOM takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope.
[01:16:46.722 --> 01:16:51.784]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer.
[01:16:51.784 --> 01:16:56.025]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[01:16:57.826 --> 01:17:12.163]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the East Coast gasoline pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast.
[01:17:12.663 --> 01:17:22.188]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and sent to the East Coast?
[01:17:22.188 --> 01:17:22.768]  That's right.
[01:17:22.768 --> 01:17:27.630]  Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed.
[01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:29.812]  Joe Biden did that to America.
[01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:30.772]  He has the history.
[01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:31.873]  He has the background.
[01:17:31.873 --> 01:17:35.094]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[01:17:35.094 --> 01:17:38.636]  He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[01:17:39.396 --> 01:17:43.717]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world.
[01:17:43.717 --> 01:17:49.279]  And they want the United States, Europe, and Australia crippled so Communist China can be dominant.
[01:17:49.279 --> 01:17:50.819]  It's not Russia that's the enemy.
[01:17:50.819 --> 01:17:55.401]  It's Communist China and their minions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[01:17:55.401 --> 01:17:56.161]  That's the facts.
[01:17:56.161 --> 01:18:00.282]  That's the information.
[01:18:00.282 --> 01:18:02.843]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:31.687 --> 01:18:32.828]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:18:32.828 --> 01:18:33.728]  to 3 p.m.
[01:18:33.728 --> 01:18:35.109]  We're here live.
[01:18:35.109 --> 01:18:36.470]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:37.571]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:18:37.571 --> 01:18:39.933]  We'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:18:39.933 --> 01:18:41.433]  with the Alex Jones Sunday edition.
[01:18:41.433 --> 01:18:44.275]  Then Sunday live with Owens Royer, 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:18:44.275 --> 01:18:44.956]  Sunday evenings.
[01:18:44.956 --> 01:18:47.257]  There's so much news over the weekend.
[01:18:47.257 --> 01:18:48.758]  Those are very popular shows.
[01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:51.220]  People want a Sunday show, so we do it.
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:58.545]  We've also been doing a lot of Saturday special reports and podcasts that are very popular as well because things are moving so quickly.
[01:18:58.545 --> 01:18:58.705]  Now,
[01:18:59.904 --> 01:19:04.427]  Joe Hoppe is here and it makes my head spin to talk about this.
[01:19:04.427 --> 01:19:07.288]  He gave some of the background, he's sort of getting into the new developments.
[01:19:07.288 --> 01:19:09.910]  Trump put out a statement saying this shows clear fraud.
[01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:17.514]  I mean, I was reading even a 2% change in the vote in areas of Arizona would turn this back to Trump.
[01:19:17.514 --> 01:19:21.557]  I mean, none of this adds up the way the media tells us it does.
[01:19:21.557 --> 01:19:25.699]  The media told us they were going to challenge Trump no matter what, but when we challenged Joe,
[01:19:26.374 --> 01:19:27.936]  We're told we're insurrectionists.
[01:19:27.936 --> 01:19:34.602]  Stacey Abrams is still challenging her election in Georgia, but she says if we challenge this, we're white supremacists.
[01:19:34.602 --> 01:19:35.824]  We're insurrectionists.
[01:19:38.678 --> 01:19:38.858]  I think
[01:19:59.705 --> 01:20:00.847]  Well, it was worse than that.
[01:20:00.847 --> 01:20:01.228]  Exactly.
[01:20:01.228 --> 01:20:03.211]  He said, no one's questioning it.
[01:20:03.211 --> 01:20:04.974]  It's not like he said, hey, I don't question it.
[01:20:04.974 --> 01:20:06.737]  He said, no one's questioning it.
[01:20:06.737 --> 01:20:08.139]  That's total gaslighting.
[01:20:08.139 --> 01:20:10.082]  The majority of America doesn't buy it.
[01:20:10.786 --> 01:20:11.627]  Absolutely.
[01:20:11.627 --> 01:20:12.728]  And you know what?
[01:20:12.728 --> 01:20:14.009]  And nobody buys him.
[01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:18.232]  If there's no Trump, you know, good luck, McCartney.
[01:20:18.232 --> 01:20:22.315]  He took credit for winning those seats during this past election.
[01:20:22.315 --> 01:20:23.636]  Again, another anomaly.
[01:20:23.636 --> 01:20:30.882]  Trump wins 27 of the 27 or so split seats, all go Republican, but the president doesn't win?
[01:20:30.882 --> 01:20:37.587]  I mean, Trump wins 17 out of 18 bellwether counties across the country that always go with the winner, and yet
[01:20:38.419 --> 01:20:39.360]  Trump doesn't win?
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.182]  I mean, there's so many anomalies we know.
[01:20:41.182 --> 01:20:43.445]  We've also got census data showing it was stolen.
[01:20:43.445 --> 01:20:44.707]  But you got cut off by the break.
[01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:53.116]  You were getting into all the pressure they're putting on the Justice Department to try to come in and stop states from following their constitutional right to investigate an election.
[01:20:53.116 --> 01:20:53.937]  And that's what they want.
[01:20:53.937 --> 01:20:57.382]  The Democrats want to cement the fraud of 2020 with this H.R. 1.
[01:20:59.562 --> 01:21:02.224]  Yeah, well, we'll never have an election again.
[01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:06.166]  And we knew this, Alex, you know, while this, you know, BS was going on.
[01:21:06.166 --> 01:21:08.988]  We knew this will be our last election.
[01:21:08.988 --> 01:21:11.910]  And these Republicans that think, oh, we can just fix this.
[01:21:12.759 --> 01:21:12.999]  You know.
[01:21:33.642 --> 01:21:42.510]  But we're not going to look at what caused, what were the issues that really caused it, but we're going to set up, we're going to go straight to our recommendations for what we're going to do for the future.
[01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:44.732]  You tell that auditor to go back to start.
[01:21:44.732 --> 01:21:46.794]  You need to dig into this and tell me exactly.
[01:21:46.794 --> 01:21:48.696]  You think the auditor was getting paid off?
[01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:50.718]  You think the auditor was getting money?
[01:21:50.718 --> 01:21:51.999]  Well, there you go.
[01:21:51.999 --> 01:21:53.140]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:21:55.010 --> 01:22:12.163]  You know, getting back to Arizona, what happened significantly this week, and Jim has been really pushing for this, my twin brother Jim, who's the founder of the Gateway Pundit, pushing, they've got to start getting some information out from their effort because the Democrats are going to come in and they're going to get this thing shut down.
[01:22:12.163 --> 01:22:17.467]  If they're going to steal an election, they're not going to allow an audit like this
[01:22:18.707 --> 01:22:20.208]  To finish, to complete.
[01:22:20.208 --> 01:22:22.569]  And you notice they're moving heaven and earth to block it.
[01:22:22.569 --> 01:22:25.871]  If they had nothing to hide, why act like they're so scared?
[01:22:25.871 --> 01:22:30.213]  They are absolutely frightened, which is absolutely proof that something's going on.
[01:22:30.213 --> 01:22:31.593]  Again, put your auditor hat on.
[01:22:31.593 --> 01:22:38.136]  If you walk into an area, somebody starts pushing back, you know immediately you need to push harder because there's something going on there.
[01:22:38.136 --> 01:22:42.318]  And I'll get more into why Trump's saying this is conclusive, and I agree with him.
[01:22:42.318 --> 01:22:43.639]  If you've got dominion,
[01:22:44.665 --> 01:22:47.188]  Erasing the servers when they weren't supposed to.
[01:22:47.188 --> 01:22:50.612]  And you have the Democrats saying before, oh, we won't give it to you, but it's there.
[01:22:50.612 --> 01:22:52.314]  I remember them saying, we have all this.
[01:22:52.314 --> 01:22:53.435]  We haven't erased it.
[01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:54.676]  And people said, we think they erased it.
[01:22:54.676 --> 01:22:55.657]  Now they've erased it.
[01:22:55.657 --> 01:22:57.820]  My God, that's smoking gun right there.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:01.504]  And then with the audit, it doesn't match up to what the computers originally said.
[01:23:02.358 --> 01:23:02.938]  That's right.
[01:23:02.938 --> 01:23:09.780]  And so the Senate subpoenas the Maricopa County, these five, mostly Republicans, push back, push back, push back.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:14.781]  Finally, the judge steps in and says, no, they have every right to request this information.
[01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:16.421]  They've got a valid subpoena.
[01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:20.102]  And then these guys from Maricopa County don't provide them what they needed.
[01:23:20.102 --> 01:23:21.663]  And it was it was it was shocking.
[01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:22.923]  This letter was massive.
[01:23:23.263 --> 01:23:35.671]  And we're really happy that these guys finally did it so that Americans can see, and they're not going to get this through the mainstream, but through your own effort you can see, you can go read the letter, all the things that were missing.
[01:23:35.671 --> 01:23:38.914]  There are a couple just devastating items on that list.
[01:23:38.914 --> 01:23:39.974]  Devastating.
[01:23:39.974 --> 01:23:46.799]  They had deleted a database, and you were referring to this with Dominion, but a chunk of the database is gone.
[01:23:47.299 --> 01:23:54.604]  And they can tell it was deleted about three days before the election, or before the machines were handed over to these auditors.
[01:23:54.604 --> 01:23:57.025]  I mean, that doesn't make sense.
[01:23:57.025 --> 01:23:58.486]  So, what were they deleting?
[01:23:58.486 --> 01:23:59.767]  Well, it does make perfect sense.
[01:23:59.767 --> 01:24:03.730]  Three days before they finally, the court orders are handed over, they go in and they wipe the damn sucker.
[01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:09.894]  What was on those machines that they would go to the extent that they did to delete that information?
[01:24:09.894 --> 01:24:12.496]  Because I believe what they did is they broke a subpoena.
[01:24:12.496 --> 01:24:14.517]  That's a crime.
[01:24:14.517 --> 01:24:16.458]  You cannot freaking do what they did.
[01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:23.703]  But they also didn't provide, and what was in some of those files that they deleted were these adjudicated files.
[01:24:23.703 --> 01:24:25.724]  The files that were adjudicated.
[01:24:25.724 --> 01:24:28.306]  They at least had a record or something of these files.
[01:24:28.306 --> 01:24:29.327]  That's gone now.
[01:24:29.327 --> 01:24:33.229]  So I mentioned how that whole process makes these machines invalid.
[01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.430]  We're good to go.
[01:24:56.431 --> 01:24:58.113]  That was in the Senate's report.
[01:24:58.113 --> 01:25:12.648]  We also found out that a couple of days prior to this letter, even, that the passwords to the routers and to some of the system, they don't have.
[01:25:12.648 --> 01:25:14.590]  The Maricopa County people said, we don't have it.
[01:25:15.535 --> 01:25:17.016]  Dominion is the assumption.
[01:25:17.016 --> 01:25:18.618]  Dominion has those passwords.
[01:25:18.618 --> 01:25:22.581]  And then Dominion comes out yesterday and says, we're not going to give you those passwords.
[01:25:22.581 --> 01:25:32.489]  So that's going to be another issue to get at these passwords at the high level, the administrative level, so that they can determine all the information and all the things that happen.
[01:25:32.489 --> 01:25:34.191]  Another roadblock by these guys.
[01:25:34.571 --> 01:25:41.814]  But this is important because no company that I'm ever aware of has a system that they don't have the admin rights to.
[01:25:41.814 --> 01:25:49.077]  The admin rights set you at the top where you can basically do anything in that system to fix it if there's issues.
[01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:55.360]  And usually the corporation that leases the software or purchases that software has that ability.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.721]  And yet, the American...
[01:26:10.655 --> 01:26:15.136]  Well, we do think that probably Biden's DOJ is going to do something to try to stop it.
[01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:26.160]  What we've been recommending these guys down in Arizona to do is have good records of what they have, backup whatever they've done off-site, to make sure that they can report at any time the massive amount of fraud that they've already found.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.861]  We've gone through like half a million ballots out of 2.1 million, they say, so far.
[01:26:30.861 --> 01:26:36.682]  I hope it's more than that, and we need to know how many of those were invalid.
[01:26:36.682 --> 01:26:41.363]  I've heard there may be something up to 200,000 of those ballots that might be invalid.
[01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:42.884]  So, who knows?
[01:26:42.884 --> 01:26:45.865]  We don't know yet, but that's what I've heard.
[01:26:45.865 --> 01:26:49.425]  The other thing, Alex, real quick, ten seconds to go.
[01:26:49.425 --> 01:26:52.346]  We know that they don't have any chain of custody records.
[01:26:52.346 --> 01:26:52.906]  Don't hang up!
[01:26:52.906 --> 01:26:53.326]  Don't hang up!
[01:26:53.326 --> 01:26:53.966]  We've got to go to break.
[01:26:53.966 --> 01:26:55.087]  Two more minutes on the other side.
[01:26:55.087 --> 01:26:55.867]  We've got to hear this.
[01:26:56.630 --> 01:27:02.612]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything!
[01:27:04.295 --> 01:27:08.196]  Has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[01:27:08.196 --> 01:27:09.477]  We've got the best out there.
[01:27:09.477 --> 01:27:14.618]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[01:27:14.618 --> 01:27:16.999]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does.
[01:27:16.999 --> 01:27:21.100]  And it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:22.841]  This is also clean fish oil.
[01:27:22.841 --> 01:27:25.542]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock.
[01:27:25.542 --> 01:27:25.822]  50% off.
[01:27:25.822 --> 01:27:27.342]  Grill oil is set to sell out.
[01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:28.963]  It's amazing as well.
[01:27:28.963 --> 01:27:32.844]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off.
[01:27:33.524 --> 01:27:34.085]  I think so.
[01:27:56.625 --> 01:28:01.790]  People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year?
[01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:09.837]  Because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year, it's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution.
[01:28:09.837 --> 01:28:12.960]  And not just that, fuel and every other major commodity.
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:15.321]  The globalists want a post-industrial world.
[01:28:15.321 --> 01:28:17.123]  They're hitting us with economic war.
[01:28:17.123 --> 01:28:18.684]  I told you food prices would explode.
[01:28:18.684 --> 01:28:19.824]  They're now exploding.
[01:28:19.824 --> 01:28:22.786]  Our great sponsor, MyPatriot, has barely gone up in price.
[01:28:22.786 --> 01:28:26.569]  Their competitors have gone up even more, but they're about to go up in two weeks.
[01:28:26.569 --> 01:28:32.933]  But instead of just holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening, and then it's got to go up.
[01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:34.694]  10% off at infowarestore.com.
[01:28:35.234 --> 01:28:36.155]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:28:36.155 --> 01:28:36.935]  We're good to go!

[01:29:43.917 --> 01:29:47.998]  As soon as you use it, you can tell that this formula is the real deal.
[01:29:47.998 --> 01:29:54.180]  So get your bottle of the new Activated Charcoal Mouthwash right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:30:00.268 --> 01:30:08.354]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:08.354 --> 01:30:29.290]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:32.230 --> 01:30:34.193]  Joe Hoft is a very calm guy.
[01:30:34.193 --> 01:30:36.317]  He's a big corporate auditor.
[01:30:36.317 --> 01:30:42.467]  His brother drafted him in to help back with the whole COVID exaggerated BS and then of course with the election.
[01:30:42.467 --> 01:30:46.293]  And really the Gateway Pundit has been the best one-stop shop exposing all the systematic fraud.
[01:30:47.544 --> 01:30:52.832]  And he's a lot like me in that he's not hyper like I am, but he likes to lay out the whole compendium.
[01:30:52.832 --> 01:30:59.982]  And so half the time we had with him, he spent just giving us the background, the anomalies, the history, and then now the big meat and potatoes.
[01:30:59.982 --> 01:31:04.348]  So I'm going to try to give him the floor, and I'm going to try to shut up for five minutes to recap the latest developments.
[01:31:05.029 --> 01:31:25.534]  And then finish up with what you were trying to get to, because you add these things together, the hiding it, the cover up, the numbers showing Trump won that we're getting, the fact that they're desperate wanting the DOJ to come in and shut it down, the fact that they wiped it, not having the chain of custody, I mean, this is, and now wanting to submit it in federal law to federalize elections with a federal dictatorship?
[01:31:25.534 --> 01:31:27.414]  I mean, this is, this is incredible.
[01:31:27.414 --> 01:31:28.674]  This is happening.
[01:31:28.674 --> 01:31:31.495]  They're making their move because there was a major political realignment.
[01:31:32.055 --> 01:31:34.497]  America turned against globalism and leftist garbage.
[01:31:34.497 --> 01:31:36.398]  It's happened all over the world, not just here.
[01:31:36.398 --> 01:31:43.464]  And so they're having to set up a technocratic dictatorship, basically a fraud in my view.
[01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:45.885]  So recap and then get to the final point.
[01:31:50.174 --> 01:31:51.154]  That's so true, Alex.
[01:31:51.154 --> 01:31:53.856]  And I guess here's the point that I could make.
[01:31:53.856 --> 01:32:05.300]  The difference between reality, which is the corporate world, and what we're seeing right now, which is politics and this totally corrupt system that's running this country right now.
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:15.124]  And in a corporate world, if you had two divisions, one being an audit shop and one being a whatever, the marketing group or whoever this audit team might be looking at.
[01:32:15.124 --> 01:32:19.866]  And if the audit team came in and tried to get information related to their audit,
[01:32:20.186 --> 01:32:20.286]  Yeah.
[01:32:36.493 --> 01:32:37.253]  We're good to go.
[01:33:02.874 --> 01:33:13.827]  To the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors was that, hey, we've asked for what's called chain of custody documentation on all the ballots and you haven't provided us any.
[01:33:13.827 --> 01:33:14.829]  So where is it?
[01:33:14.829 --> 01:33:15.910]  What's going on?
[01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:19.254]  Is there any, can you tell us why you haven't provided that?
[01:33:19.654 --> 01:33:28.599]  And what this chain of custody documentation is, is it's just a document that you fill out whenever a ballot comes in that needs to be moved from here to there.
[01:33:28.599 --> 01:33:35.182]  People sign off on one end, people that drop it, they drop it off, people that pick it up again, they sign off on that end, and you have a chain.
[01:33:35.182 --> 01:33:39.905]  It's just like when you get a UPS or Amazon delivery, the driver signs it, you sign it, it's a chain of custody.
[01:33:39.905 --> 01:33:40.385]  That's right.
[01:33:40.385 --> 01:33:46.908]  You know everybody that had it and when they had it and with their initials, they've signed off on it.
[01:33:46.908 --> 01:33:48.289]  This is mandated.
[01:33:49.029 --> 01:33:58.034]  In Georgia, we've looked at the law there, absolutely mandated that if a ballot doesn't have that information, it's illegitimate.
[01:33:58.034 --> 01:34:00.015]  It's not a legal ballot.
[01:34:00.015 --> 01:34:09.480]  And we found in Georgia, there's 355,000 ballots right now today that have no chain of custody documentation on them.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.040]  That means they're invalid.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.782]  And you can bet 95 to 99% of those ballots are all for Joe Biden.
[01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:18.263]  Same thing in Arizona here.
[01:34:18.263 --> 01:34:24.211]  They're saying we don't have any information on any of these ballots related to their custody.
[01:34:24.211 --> 01:34:33.724]  And then we've got Pennsylvania, the USPS driver, where he's got a truckload of them and they're all scanned in against Trump by a machine.
[01:34:33.724 --> 01:34:34.305]  He can see it.
[01:34:35.347 --> 01:34:44.570]  Think about Michigan, Wisconsin, where they dumped 140,000 ballots in the middle of the night, you know, all over.
[01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:51.493]  We, the Republicans and people that want to see the truth behind these elections, but they really could zero in on us.
[01:34:51.493 --> 01:34:53.934]  Let's look at the chain of custody documentation.
[01:34:53.934 --> 01:34:59.136]  And every single ballot that doesn't have it, we want to know what it is and who they voted for.
[01:34:59.136 --> 01:35:02.897]  And we will take those totals out of the vote because they're not legitimate.
[01:35:03.339 --> 01:35:06.078]  And everybody that certified these things should be...
[01:35:07.233 --> 01:35:10.974]  Should be dealt with properly, according to the law.
[01:35:10.974 --> 01:35:15.415]  If you certify a fraudulent election, then you should be held accountable.
[01:35:15.415 --> 01:35:18.036]  And these people should go to jail, in my mind.
[01:35:18.036 --> 01:35:20.056]  This is horrible, what's happened here.
[01:35:20.056 --> 01:35:28.018]  And the true winner of this election has been abused like I've never seen anybody abused in my life, and it's Donald Trump, in my opinion.
[01:35:28.018 --> 01:35:33.559]  Well, that's because they're guilty, they're going for broke, and they basically robbed the bank, they're breaking the social contract.
[01:35:33.559 --> 01:35:35.520]  In closing, talk about chain of custody.
[01:35:36.469 --> 01:35:50.337]  We know they fought tooth and nail for months to block the Senate and to block the courts and to block people from being able, in this one county that had the most ridiculous anomalies in the country, in a sea of ridiculous anomalies, in my view.
[01:35:50.337 --> 01:35:51.297]  Right.
[01:35:51.297 --> 01:36:01.102]  And then, talk about chain of custody, we need to know the names of who went in three days before and wiped those computers, because those computers are now really the chain of custody of what happened.
[01:36:01.102 --> 01:36:02.283]  They're just as important as the ballots.
[01:36:03.308 --> 01:36:04.068]  That's right, Alex.
[01:36:04.068 --> 01:36:05.409]  That was a crime.
[01:36:05.409 --> 01:36:08.130]  And that's like obstructing justice.
[01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:14.412]  That's like tampering with whatever the evidence.
[01:36:14.412 --> 01:36:15.572]  Those are crimes.
[01:36:15.572 --> 01:36:17.473]  And these people should be held accountable.
[01:36:17.473 --> 01:36:23.956]  And if you can't, in my opinion, if you can't determine exactly who it is, then you go a layer up, and you go a layer up.
[01:36:23.956 --> 01:36:27.997]  And eventually, if you have to indict every one of those board of supervisors, or you have to
[01:36:28.157 --> 01:36:30.939]  Indict the people from Dominion that were involved in the case.
[01:36:30.939 --> 01:36:34.722]  If they're at fault, if we can see that, then they need to be indicted.
[01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:36.743]  And we already know these guys, they lie about everything.
[01:36:36.743 --> 01:36:41.587]  One other thing, I was thinking about the routers that they said, we can't give that to you because there's personal information.
[01:36:41.587 --> 01:36:42.668]  That's garbage.
[01:36:42.668 --> 01:36:46.030]  You talk to any IT professional, that too was garbage.
[01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:56.418]  I'll tell you a story, and I'm no master forensics guy like you, but 20 years ago, we already had a shopping cart, and I could look at the graph of stuff sold for a month on American Express,
[01:36:57.210 --> 01:37:02.074]  And about halfway through the month, the American Express orders went down about 30%.
[01:37:02.074 --> 01:37:06.337]  So it was just like the Biden graph in Michigan and other states is under Trump.
[01:37:06.337 --> 01:37:09.940]  And then as soon as they, you know, get all these magic ballots, it goes straight up.
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:15.264]  Well, I saw it go straight down to the date and then not get a bunch of orders.
[01:37:15.264 --> 01:37:17.165]  So I did an investigation, called American Express.
[01:37:17.165 --> 01:37:18.246]  They checked.
[01:37:18.246 --> 01:37:24.811]  Somebody in Minnesota with my same name had somehow gotten in and changed, but was only able to get
[01:37:25.547 --> 01:37:28.348]  Certain amounts of the cards with certain prefixes.
[01:37:28.348 --> 01:37:29.428]  I don't know how it all worked.
[01:37:29.428 --> 01:37:33.429]  So about half of our American Express orders were going to this guy for like a month.
[01:37:33.429 --> 01:37:34.850]  He said it was an accident and gave it back.
[01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:40.472]  But I mean, I could see the graph and see it went straight down that someone was grabbing those orders.
[01:37:40.472 --> 01:37:41.452]  I called American Express.
[01:37:41.452 --> 01:37:41.912]  They agreed.
[01:37:41.912 --> 01:37:42.712]  They found out.
[01:37:42.712 --> 01:37:43.152]  It stopped.
[01:37:43.152 --> 01:37:50.795]  So anybody can look at these graphs and see it goes straight up when everything else is an organic curve and then a straight up curve.
[01:37:50.795 --> 01:37:51.535]  That's a fraud.
[01:37:52.626 --> 01:37:53.248]  Outrageous.
[01:37:53.248 --> 01:37:54.672]  And you know, Alex, we knew this.
[01:37:54.672 --> 01:37:58.382]  We saw these charts on November 4th, the day after the election.
[01:37:58.382 --> 01:37:59.705]  We saw very similar charts.
[01:38:00.405 --> 01:38:06.370]  That day we knew that there was these big dumps and, you know, prove to us that they're valid.
[01:38:06.370 --> 01:38:09.553]  Give us that chain of custody documentation on all those ballots.
[01:38:09.553 --> 01:38:11.795]  And let's not give them time to make up stuff.
[01:38:11.795 --> 01:38:14.457]  Let's, let's freaking get that information right now.
[01:38:14.457 --> 01:38:15.638]  And let's see.
[01:38:15.638 --> 01:38:26.928]  And I tell you what, these, these secretaries of state that approved these, uh, these elections and said everything was fine, knowing that they had hundreds of thousands of ballots without chain of custody documentation.
[01:38:27.569 --> 01:38:29.196]  They should be held accountable.
[01:38:29.196 --> 01:38:31.988]  They started to find an election that was fraudulent and they knew it.
[01:38:32.762 --> 01:38:35.483]  So that's just a simple test that could be done.
[01:38:35.483 --> 01:38:39.524]  There's so much fraud in so many other ways, too, that needs to be looked into.
[01:38:39.524 --> 01:38:41.585]  I think we need to look into every single state.
[01:38:41.585 --> 01:38:48.827]  I think if I was any, every state should contact their legislature and say, we want to know, Trump won Florida by 4%.
[01:38:48.827 --> 01:38:50.347]  How much did he really win by?
[01:38:50.347 --> 01:38:52.888]  Texas, how much did he really win by?
[01:38:52.888 --> 01:38:57.170]  We need to look at all the states and figure out how much massive fraud there was.
[01:38:57.170 --> 01:38:58.330]  The number will shock people.
[01:38:59.162 --> 01:39:04.665]  I totally agree with you, and in closing, Joe, at GatewayPundit.com, we really appreciate you and your brother and your whole great team.
[01:39:04.665 --> 01:39:17.331]  We're told we're insurrectionists and criminals day one, even before the Capitol, that we're not supposed to ask a question when the Democrats, Hillary and all of them, said, we're going to block this, we think he's going to win one way or another, we'll never accept it.
[01:39:18.032 --> 01:39:23.984]  And John Podesta was in the New York Times saying, we'll have a secession of Democrat states and have our own inauguration.
[01:39:23.984 --> 01:39:29.115]  They said, one way or another, Pelosi said, Trump will not be sworn in and they made good on that.
[01:39:30.672 --> 01:39:32.353]  Yeah, it's just, it's totally shocking.
[01:39:32.353 --> 01:39:43.538]  And I remember Mark Fincham from Arizona saying, hey, the thing that separates this country from other countries is we have the ability to go in and review elections and to audit them and to look at them.
[01:39:43.538 --> 01:39:52.322]  And they need to be done by qualified auditors that will do a fair and fair... And lo and behold, we found evidence of fraud and I didn't want to send the judge's department in.
[01:39:52.322 --> 01:39:53.903]  Joe Hoff, thank you so much, sir.
[01:39:53.903 --> 01:39:54.663]  Thank you.
[01:39:54.663 --> 01:39:55.224]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:39:55.224 --> 01:39:55.724]  Great job.
[01:39:55.724 --> 01:40:00.326]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[01:40:00.988 --> 01:40:03.730]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[01:40:03.730 --> 01:40:05.431]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[01:40:05.431 --> 01:40:07.092]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[01:40:07.092 --> 01:40:08.052]  That was a crazy week.
[01:40:08.052 --> 01:40:19.719]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[01:40:19.719 --> 01:40:21.040]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[01:40:22.518 --> 01:40:24.919]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[01:40:24.919 --> 01:40:26.299]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[01:40:26.299 --> 01:40:30.560]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.781]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[01:40:32.781 --> 01:40:34.281]  I don't think that happens very often.
[01:40:34.281 --> 01:40:35.101]  It's never happened to me.
[01:40:35.101 --> 01:40:38.002]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[01:40:38.002 --> 01:40:39.743]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[01:40:39.743 --> 01:40:42.624]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[01:40:42.624 --> 01:40:43.864]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[01:40:43.864 --> 01:40:44.144]  Okay.
[01:40:44.344 --> 01:40:45.585]  I want to take control of my life.
[01:40:45.585 --> 01:40:46.707]  I want to take control of my health.
[01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:50.591]  And that's why you need to go to InfoWars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[01:40:50.591 --> 01:40:51.772]  Don't buy into the groupthink.
[01:40:51.772 --> 01:40:52.773]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[01:40:52.773 --> 01:40:53.914]  Drink the TurboForce.
[01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:55.796]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[01:40:55.796 --> 01:41:02.343]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say, thank you for what you've done.
[01:41:02.343 --> 01:41:04.285]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[01:41:04.285 --> 01:41:05.727]  Thank you for praying for us.
[01:41:05.727 --> 01:41:06.808]  And thank you for spreading the word.
[01:41:08.038 --> 01:41:18.462]  If all of you will simply go to Infowarsstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or Droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[01:41:18.462 --> 01:41:23.864]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[01:41:24.424 --> 01:41:30.369]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[01:41:30.369 --> 01:41:36.875]  And in this surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[01:41:36.875 --> 01:41:39.357]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[01:41:39.357 --> 01:41:41.899]  They're available at InfoWareStore.com in four different colors.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.263]  And they are only $19.95.
[01:41:44.263 --> 01:41:48.390]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:51.595]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the Infowar.
[01:41:51.595 --> 01:41:54.621]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the Infowar.
[01:41:57.253 --> 01:41:59.114]  It's Thursday morning, May 13th.
[01:41:59.114 --> 01:42:06.979]  I'm sitting in my studio getting ready to go live, and I am just cutting this bulletin to all the listeners and all the viewers to understand how serious the situation is.
[01:42:06.979 --> 01:42:12.963]  Just two weeks ago, I predicted you'd see massive inflation explode, that they would cut off more pipelines.
[01:42:13.223 --> 01:42:15.183]  I said it on air more than 50 times.
[01:42:15.183 --> 01:42:21.845]  Because America is under strategic globalist attack in an economic trade war to make sure China wins.
[01:42:21.845 --> 01:42:23.685]  This is World War III.
[01:42:23.685 --> 01:42:26.406]  And I told listeners, you need to get storable food.
[01:42:26.406 --> 01:42:28.046]  You need to get water filtration.
[01:42:28.046 --> 01:42:29.247]  Those are some of the basics you need.
[01:42:29.247 --> 01:42:33.208]  And we have the best storable food at the lowest prices you're going to find anywhere.
[01:42:33.208 --> 01:42:35.428]  Now, the sale was supposed to end yesterday.
[01:42:35.428 --> 01:42:37.309]  But I'm running it through the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th.
[01:42:39.469 --> 01:42:44.192]  Because so many people have requested that I extend it so people have a chance to get this great deal.
[01:42:44.192 --> 01:42:46.714]  2020 prices in the year 2021.
[01:42:46.714 --> 01:42:52.558]  And then my patrons can have to go up on prices because everybody else is already and the raw materials are skyrocketing.
[01:42:52.558 --> 01:42:56.921]  They have the food ready to ship right now at preparewithalex.com 10% off.
[01:42:56.921 --> 01:42:59.302]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[01:42:59.302 --> 01:43:01.024]  It's very bittersweet.
[01:43:01.024 --> 01:43:04.026]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[01:43:04.026 --> 01:43:06.187]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[01:43:06.187 --> 01:43:07.468]  I care about beating the new world order.
[01:43:08.234 --> 01:43:12.940]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:16.285]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[01:43:16.285 --> 01:43:17.807]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[01:43:17.807 --> 01:43:19.009]  But let's just say this.
[01:43:19.009 --> 01:43:20.330]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[01:43:20.330 --> 01:43:22.794]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[01:43:23.414 --> 01:43:27.055]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:43:27.055 --> 01:43:29.616]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[01:43:29.616 --> 01:43:32.797]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[01:43:32.797 --> 01:43:33.657]  Do they fund freedom?
[01:43:33.657 --> 01:43:34.758]  No, a lot of them don't.
[01:43:34.758 --> 01:43:41.220]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:42.940]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:45.781]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[01:43:46.361 --> 01:43:49.482]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[01:43:49.482 --> 01:43:59.927]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[01:43:59.927 --> 01:44:08.551]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:08.551 --> 01:44:13.793]  You look like an angel.
[01:44:27.905 --> 01:44:32.887]  I was on the war room yesterday in the first hour, part of it with Owen Schroyer.
[01:44:32.887 --> 01:44:35.328]  He made a really good point that's actually backed up by facts.
[01:44:35.328 --> 01:44:35.648]  He said,
[01:44:36.323 --> 01:44:43.249]  They backed off on the mask early because there's so much pressure to it, and because people are pushing back, they want to kill that opposition.
[01:44:43.249 --> 01:44:49.955]  And once we dissipate our movement against them, there's so much pressure on Fauci and others that launched the attack.
[01:44:49.955 --> 01:44:53.819]  And the power grab, then they'll bring it back later.
[01:44:53.819 --> 01:44:57.422]  And Owen was absolutely right when he said that.
[01:44:57.422 --> 01:44:58.623]  And I want to explain something.
[01:44:58.623 --> 01:45:00.625]  The globalists telegraph what they're going to do.
[01:45:01.374 --> 01:45:15.000]  They were going to announce no mask outdoors on July 4th, but everybody was so pissed at them and not buying it and leaving their blue cities that they go, okay, and they did it a few weeks ago.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:27.465]  But then people were still angry at them, so they were still planning July 4th to say, all right, if you've been vaccinated, you don't need to wear a mask inside to get you ready down the road to check your QR code that you've been vaccinated with the poison.
[01:45:29.091 --> 01:45:32.134]  But there was so much pressure, he went ahead and did it yesterday.
[01:45:32.134 --> 01:45:36.477]  So, your pressure is having an effect on these puppets.
[01:45:36.477 --> 01:45:40.641]  Look, if I explained why they shut down the pipeline and how I know they did it, it would take an hour.
[01:45:40.641 --> 01:45:42.102]  I've already done it.
[01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:57.635]  If you read in the Globalist documents, if you get into how they're going to take down society, they say, carbon taxes, shutting down the infrastructure with orders, regulations and control, and hackers
[01:45:58.553 --> 01:46:01.975]  are going to help get us to net zero.
[01:46:01.975 --> 01:46:10.240]  And what that means is they either do it themselves or they let hacker subsidiaries do it and let them get away with it.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:14.923]  There's even articles like, well, the hackers did help cut the carbon footprint.
[01:46:14.923 --> 01:46:27.931]  So instead of like having Earth First put spikes in trees so if you hit it with a saw, it shoots out and kills you in your heart, or instead of dynamiting a pipeline, which they've done, or instead of shooting at pipeline workers,
[01:46:29.665 --> 01:46:34.772]  Or like they do during riots, shooting at firefighters and telephone repair people.
[01:46:34.772 --> 01:46:36.734]  Instead of that, oh no, oh, hackers did it!
[01:46:36.734 --> 01:46:40.359]  It's just a nebulous enemy that did it.
[01:46:40.359 --> 01:46:45.366]  I watched Biden order four days, five days before the storm hit.
[01:46:45.366 --> 01:46:47.909]  The state of Texas said, please let us take the carbon restrictions off.
[01:46:48.689 --> 01:46:51.430]  We need to up coal and natural gas use.
[01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:56.132]  You have to get an emergency authorization or there's million dollar fines per facility per day.
[01:46:56.132 --> 01:47:02.495]  And if you don't tell them it's a felony, you can go to jail.
[01:47:02.495 --> 01:47:04.976]  We need to repeal that crap.
[01:47:04.976 --> 01:47:08.697]  People ask, well, why didn't they just turn the pipeline on by hand?
[01:47:08.697 --> 01:47:13.699]  Under emergency rules that Biden put back in place, they've shut down almost all the pipelines in California.
[01:47:13.699 --> 01:47:15.320]  They're trying to shut down the one in Michigan.
[01:47:16.099 --> 01:47:22.304]  And they tell the hires up in those companies, actually, you've got to get an environmental assessment before you turn those on by hand.
[01:47:22.304 --> 01:47:23.786]  There might be an accident.
[01:47:23.786 --> 01:47:26.087]  What did Whitmer say two days ago to London Guardian?
[01:47:26.087 --> 01:47:27.449]  She gave a speech.
[01:47:27.449 --> 01:47:33.073]  She said, well, it's never had an accident, but I'm scared the hackers might get it.
[01:47:33.073 --> 01:47:35.495]  Oh, so they might shut it down so we better.
[01:47:35.495 --> 01:47:39.799]  It's like, oh, if I have a child, they might die in a car wreck, you know, when they're 10 years old.
[01:47:39.799 --> 01:47:40.699]  So I better not have a child.
[01:47:40.699 --> 01:47:42.101]  I better not go outside.
[01:47:42.101 --> 01:47:43.442]  I might catch a cold.
[01:47:43.442 --> 01:47:44.943]  This is the crazy attitude.
[01:47:46.351 --> 01:47:48.572]  But that's just their cover story for all this.
[01:47:48.572 --> 01:48:04.576]  So yes, yes, the group shutting thousands of pipelines down in the West, the group that shut down all of Spain's gas and oil, basically, and bankrupted them, the same one that sent it to England, the same one doing it to Australia, who said they'd do it, yes, yes, they're behind it.
[01:48:04.576 --> 01:48:05.976]  Not some nebulous thing.
[01:48:05.976 --> 01:48:07.816]  Oh, of course, out of Russia.
[01:48:07.816 --> 01:48:09.817]  Give me a break.
[01:48:12.358 --> 01:48:17.820]  Yeah, now Whitmer says, okay, you got a treaty, you can run this gas pipeline, gasoline into the U.S.
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:19.360]  and oil.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:24.342]  We're just gonna seize your company.
[01:48:24.342 --> 01:48:31.225]  By the way, Whitmer, a treaty overrides a governor's fat mouth.
[01:48:31.225 --> 01:48:35.286]  If a state wanted to secede, then it could override the treaty.
[01:48:35.286 --> 01:48:38.387]  Oh, but you'll say states can't secede even though they can in the Constitution.
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:43.942]  That decision, that was not all cleared up with the Civil War, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:43.942 --> 01:48:49.144]  And I've also heard the national news go, the chairman of the Republican Party, Alan West, is wrong.
[01:48:49.144 --> 01:48:51.104]  Texas is not allowed to succeed.
[01:48:51.104 --> 01:48:57.807]  I'm going to explain to you that two states have it in their founding and in their constitution.
[01:48:57.807 --> 01:49:00.048]  And that's New Hampshire and that's Texas.
[01:49:00.048 --> 01:49:05.390]  But that's why Texas is called the Lone Star State.
[01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:06.250]  Because it was a country
[01:49:06.937 --> 01:49:12.500]  And that it entered by treaty and may remove itself with a vote of the legislature.
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:16.481]  That's in the damn entrance into the U.S.
[01:49:16.481 --> 01:49:18.342]  and Allen West is right.
[01:49:18.342 --> 01:49:27.847]  But again, they think you're stupid and New Hampshire just has a right to revolt and do whatever the hell it wants, which I think every state should have.
[01:49:27.847 --> 01:49:32.829]  But when New Hampshire entered the Union, they put in their right to revolt.
[01:49:34.201 --> 01:49:38.842]  Which is in our Declaration of Independence, which doesn't give us the right, it enshrines it.
[01:49:38.842 --> 01:49:39.702]  And it points it out.
[01:49:39.702 --> 01:49:46.883]  So, long before we get violent, we need to get political, we need to get loud, we need to get aggressive.
[01:49:46.883 --> 01:49:47.823]  And we're doing that.
[01:49:47.823 --> 01:49:48.784]  And we're winning, folks.
[01:49:48.784 --> 01:49:49.944]  The enemy has counterstruck.
[01:49:49.944 --> 01:49:53.544]  As negative as all this is, things are going to get a lot better.
[01:49:53.544 --> 01:49:57.865]  Now, I want to open the phones up on any subject you want to call in about.
[01:49:57.865 --> 01:50:00.186]  All I ask is you have a good clean phone and you just make your point.
[01:50:00.186 --> 01:50:01.406]  Because I want to be the next person.
[01:50:01.406 --> 01:50:02.186]  I respect your time.
[01:50:03.041 --> 01:50:04.622]  We had a few callers left on hold the other day.
[01:50:04.622 --> 01:50:05.743]  We want to call them back, get them on.
[01:50:05.743 --> 01:50:06.403]  That's fine.
[01:50:06.403 --> 01:50:07.444]  If they don't answer, that's fine.
[01:50:07.444 --> 01:50:08.565]  We'll take your calls at 877-789-2539.
[01:50:08.565 --> 01:50:08.625]  877-789-2539.
[01:50:08.625 --> 01:50:08.705]  877-877-789.
[01:50:08.705 --> 01:50:09.505]  Alex is the number to join us.
[01:50:09.505 --> 01:50:16.790]  Then we have a doctor joining us who's brought out a big study that is what we already see in the news, but we already can hear from our friends and family.
[01:50:28.463 --> 01:50:34.845]  More people are now dying from the COVID shot that died of COVID, and most of the people now dying in hospitals with COVID got the vaccine.
[01:50:34.845 --> 01:50:36.106]  That's even in the news.
[01:50:36.106 --> 01:50:42.348]  The New York Yankees are all getting COVID when they already took the vaccine months ago because it's bull!
[01:50:42.348 --> 01:50:52.391]  If you've had the flu or had the cold, in the last 10 years on average, you're going to test positive at 40 cycles of a COVID.
[01:50:53.263 --> 01:50:53.943]  PCR test.
[01:50:53.943 --> 01:50:56.264]  I mean, that's the inventor said that, it's a fact.
[01:50:56.264 --> 01:51:01.547]  But we just still go with the fraud because it's, well, don't question or you're hurting those that died of COVID.
[01:51:01.547 --> 01:51:02.647]  You mean died of the flu?
[01:51:02.647 --> 01:51:03.487]  You mean died of pneumonia?
[01:51:03.487 --> 01:51:07.309]  They're like, well, then wait, you said Fauci attacked us and cooked it up.
[01:51:07.309 --> 01:51:12.511]  No, it's a real cold virus, gain of function, a nasty cold virus.
[01:51:12.511 --> 01:51:20.915]  And if you're run down and had a heart attack and cancer and don't have good absorption in your guts because of all different types of problems that people can have in their intestines,
[01:51:21.542 --> 01:51:26.466]  You know, Crohn's, Irritable Bowel, what's the other big one?
[01:51:26.466 --> 01:51:28.207]  That family, really old folks die of it.
[01:51:28.207 --> 01:51:29.609]  It's where the guts get infected.
[01:51:29.609 --> 01:51:32.371]  The point is, diverticulitis.
[01:51:32.371 --> 01:51:34.292]  Yes, you will die from any virus.
[01:51:34.292 --> 01:51:39.937]  So, but the point is, they did release it because it's novel and it would scare scientists when they looked at it.
[01:51:39.937 --> 01:51:41.838]  Because the damn thing's got five viruses in it.
[01:51:41.838 --> 01:51:45.481]  And it's a carrier in the future for more deadly strains they're going to release.
[01:51:45.481 --> 01:51:47.983]  And now you notice I said that 16 months ago, it's all coming out.
[01:51:47.983 --> 01:51:49.004]  I've got their number, folks.
[01:51:49.004 --> 01:51:50.185]  I know how they operate.
[01:51:50.185 --> 01:51:51.086]  We can beat them together.
[01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:56.307]  And then I have Tucker Carlson exposing the pedo teaching in public schools.
[01:51:56.307 --> 01:51:59.309]  And now that's the operating system of the left is sex.
[01:51:59.309 --> 01:52:05.914]  They want a relationship sexually with your children like any abuser wants to make that mark on them, to have a bigger mark to the parents.
[01:52:05.914 --> 01:52:12.038]  Only way to have a bigger mark on somebody than the parents is to have sex with them or to screw with their mind sexually.
[01:52:12.038 --> 01:52:19.284]  And they know how to tie propaganda to sex and really turn your kids into freakazoids like they are.
[01:52:19.284 --> 01:52:21.185]  So that's all coming up.
[01:52:22.652 --> 01:52:28.155]  As well, 877-789-2539, free for all, coming up.
[01:52:28.155 --> 01:52:35.099]  And then, in the fifth hour, we have another great guest host that is going to be hosting.
[01:52:35.099 --> 01:52:38.200]  He was sick last week, but he will be there.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:41.782]  And so we'll tell you all about that coming up today.
[01:52:41.782 --> 01:52:44.143]  Briefly, I want to thank you all for funding us.
[01:52:44.143 --> 01:52:46.245]  I want to thank you all for supporting us.
[01:52:46.245 --> 01:52:50.687]  We were in the red the first four months of this year, and I prayed about it, and thank God,
[01:52:51.443 --> 01:52:55.246]  Products that hadn't come in because of supply chain breakdown came in.
[01:52:55.246 --> 01:53:01.370]  Bodies came in, turbo force came in, winter sun came back in, vitamin refusion.
[01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:12.597]  You notice though that most of those are already back at regular price because they're almost sold out and then it's months before I can even get more because we can only get limited orders of the high quality stuff we've got and I'm not going to lower the formulation quality.
[01:53:12.597 --> 01:53:15.479]  That's how I know how bad the breakdown is with food and everything.
[01:53:16.099 --> 01:53:19.202]  And so, I would get these products while you still can.
[01:53:19.202 --> 01:53:22.464]  We got out of the red, into the black, but not much into the black.
[01:53:22.464 --> 01:53:25.227]  And I want to thank you all for shopping within 4WarsTore.com.
[01:53:25.227 --> 01:53:27.108]  I want to thank God for that.
[01:53:27.108 --> 01:53:32.993]  And separately, also got us out of the black, even though we make a small percentage because the food doesn't have a lot of markup, people are smart.
[01:53:32.993 --> 01:53:37.537]  They're buying a lot of food right now at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:53:37.537 --> 01:53:40.179]  It's the full catalog of My Patriot Supply.
[01:53:40.179 --> 01:53:42.020]  It's 20-20 prices of 10% off.
[01:53:43.484 --> 01:53:45.065]  They're going to go up in two or three weeks.
[01:53:45.065 --> 01:53:46.327]  They haven't given me the exact date.
[01:53:46.327 --> 01:53:49.790]  So, this isn't just keeping it at the lower price before it goes up.
[01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:50.911]  This is 10% off.
[01:53:50.911 --> 01:53:52.452]  They're already very low.
[01:53:52.452 --> 01:53:54.754]  Great prices on high-quality, storable food.
[01:53:54.754 --> 01:53:55.635]  Packaged very well.
[01:53:55.635 --> 01:53:57.336]  Very easy to transport.
[01:53:57.336 --> 01:54:02.121]  With all the commodities going up and all the craziness, I think you're nuts if you don't get storable food.
[01:54:02.121 --> 01:54:05.684]  And I know this is the best company with the highest quality for the price you pay.
[01:54:05.684 --> 01:54:06.765]  Infowarsstore.com?
[01:54:08.977 --> 01:54:13.078]  Or, preparewithalex.com, or 888-253-3139.

[01:54:24.682 --> 01:54:25.882]  They're the biggest company in the U.S.
[01:54:25.882 --> 01:54:30.544]  now, because they came from nowhere four years ago, with quality and dedication, and getting it to you.
[01:54:30.544 --> 01:54:31.484]  Here's the most important part.
[01:54:31.924 --> 01:54:34.066]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[01:54:50.111 --> 01:54:51.232]  And I just want to say something.
[01:54:51.232 --> 01:54:57.414]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer.
[01:54:57.414 --> 01:55:00.956]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[01:55:00.956 --> 01:55:03.837]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[01:55:03.837 --> 01:55:07.179]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:55:07.179 --> 01:55:08.419]  You've got red blood.
[01:55:08.419 --> 01:55:14.562]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[01:55:14.562 --> 01:55:18.184]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[01:55:18.884 --> 01:55:22.726]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[01:55:22.726 --> 01:55:25.628]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[01:55:25.628 --> 01:55:31.231]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[01:55:31.231 --> 01:55:33.112]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[01:55:33.112 --> 01:55:37.555]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[01:55:37.555 --> 01:55:41.157]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[01:55:41.157 --> 01:55:44.619]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoHorse.
[01:55:44.619 --> 01:55:44.999]  God bless.
[01:55:46.869 --> 01:55:52.871]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything!

[01:56:24.411 --> 01:56:25.011]  No.

[01:56:43.324 --> 01:56:44.264]  Ultimate Fish Oil.
[01:56:44.264 --> 01:56:45.265]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:56:45.265 --> 01:56:49.968]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:56:49.968 --> 01:56:52.630]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:09.344 --> 01:57:18.747]  Dr. Jane Ruby has huge, it's always huge news here, but really huge news on how the vaccines are killing people and hospitalizing them.
[01:57:18.747 --> 01:57:21.068]  They're calling it COVID at the bottom of the hour.
[01:57:21.068 --> 01:57:26.470]  And then Stu Peters will be hosting the fourth hour, always does a great job, head of the war room with Owen Troyer.
[01:57:27.697 --> 01:57:31.418]  So that is coming up today.
[01:57:31.418 --> 01:57:32.439]  Wow.
[01:57:32.439 --> 01:57:35.240]  I want to go to your phone calls, but I've got to get to this Tucker Carlson.
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:38.981]  So I'll go to your phone call, start the next segment in about five minutes.
[01:57:38.981 --> 01:57:40.881]  But here's the start of Carlson's report.
[01:57:40.881 --> 01:57:42.722]  The full thing's 14 minutes long.
[01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:43.702]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:57:43.702 --> 01:57:46.543]  It's obviously, you can find this on YouTube.
[01:57:46.543 --> 01:57:48.104]  They're not posting a lot of him on YouTube now.
[01:57:48.104 --> 01:57:51.025]  Notice Fox is really dialing him back in that key area.
[01:57:51.701 --> 01:57:52.942]  I'm trying to keep it compartmentalized.
[01:57:52.942 --> 01:57:54.822]  It's just Republicans that are somewhat awake.
[01:57:54.822 --> 01:57:57.843]  That's why we try to help magnify Tucker's work.
[01:57:57.843 --> 01:58:04.906]  I saw a few comments on M4's like, Tucker said, you know, it's that crazy Alex Jones that predicted the vaccine passport a year ago.
[01:58:04.906 --> 01:58:07.507]  They go, Tucker calls you crazy.
[01:58:07.507 --> 01:58:09.188]  It's called tongue in cheek.
[01:58:10.484 --> 01:58:14.329]  Like, oh look, he's crazy, like a fox?
[01:58:14.329 --> 01:58:17.152]  Yeah, let's go ahead and hear from Tucker Carlson, here it is.
[01:58:31.926 --> 01:58:35.428]  Low IQ vandals wrecking what they did not build.
[01:58:35.428 --> 01:58:38.209]  From the very bottom to the very top, they are everywhere.
[01:58:38.209 --> 01:58:39.529]  We can give you endless examples.
[01:58:39.529 --> 01:58:42.551]  Here's just one because it happened just hours ago.
[01:58:42.551 --> 01:58:48.973]  The state of California has announced its new mathematics framework for students across the state, our biggest state.
[01:58:48.973 --> 01:58:52.855]  One of the authors of this framework is a Stanford professor called Joe Bowler.
[01:58:53.573 --> 01:58:54.974]  Here's how she explained the plan.
[01:58:54.974 --> 01:58:55.895]  These are her words.
[01:58:55.895 --> 01:59:00.359]  Quote, I'm very pleased to announce the new mathematics framework for California.
[01:59:00.359 --> 01:59:01.560]  Some highlights?
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:05.103]  A strong social justice orientation.
[01:59:05.103 --> 01:59:09.127]  All students should take the same courses, kindergarten through 10th grade.
[01:59:09.127 --> 01:59:12.130]  Viva la math revolution!
[01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:12.550]  Right.
[01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:13.671]  Numbers are racist.
[01:59:13.671 --> 01:59:15.453]  Kill them.
[01:59:15.453 --> 01:59:16.594]  It's lunacy.
[01:59:16.594 --> 01:59:17.695]  It's the French Revolution.
[01:59:18.576 --> 01:59:19.837]  The stuff is everywhere.
[01:59:19.837 --> 01:59:22.658]  Have you ever taken a look at the books that your kids are being assigned in school?
[01:59:22.658 --> 01:59:25.439]  Have you actually read them?
[01:59:25.439 --> 01:59:27.840]  Parents in Loudoun County actually did read them.
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:33.602]  And one mother had the temerity to read portions of those books aloud at the Loudoun County School Board meeting.
[01:59:33.602 --> 01:59:35.623]  Watch.
[01:59:35.623 --> 01:59:37.504]  Jasper wasn't even my boyfriend.
[01:59:37.504 --> 01:59:40.565]  Just this dude I did some hacking with once in a while.
[01:59:40.565 --> 01:59:42.586]  He was pretty basic library systems.
[01:59:42.586 --> 01:59:44.006]  Low security.
[01:59:44.006 --> 01:59:45.267]  Not in my league at all.
[01:59:45.267 --> 01:59:45.887]  But he had a big...
[01:59:46.525 --> 01:59:51.434]  And sometimes a girl just needs a big... Her top lip curled up.
[01:59:51.434 --> 01:59:52.235]  Wait a minute.
[01:59:52.235 --> 01:59:54.880]  Is that what's really going on?
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:57.064]  She did your homework and you ate her...
[01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:59.771]  Is that why you're crying?
[01:59:59.771 --> 02:00:00.891]  It's okay.
[02:00:00.891 --> 02:00:01.932]  It's cool.
[02:00:01.932 --> 02:00:04.093]  This is what girls do at parties.
[02:00:04.093 --> 02:00:06.234]  I told myself and kept dancing with a boy.
[02:00:06.234 --> 02:00:11.036]  I couldn't see the alcohol making my waist wind faster.
[02:00:11.036 --> 02:00:17.579]  If this is inappropriate for me to read to you, this is inappropriate for our children.
[02:00:17.579 --> 02:00:19.700]  How much did the billion-dollar porn industry
[02:00:20.504 --> 02:00:21.985]  ...contributed to LCPS.
[02:00:21.985 --> 02:00:31.531]  My question is now, are you going to use the whole language approach to coincide with his bio reading and teach pole dancing in PE?
[02:00:31.531 --> 02:00:34.993]  No, that was not to kill a mockingbird with Scout and Pooh Valley.
[02:00:34.993 --> 02:00:35.954]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:00:35.954 --> 02:00:37.575]  The full report is on InfoWars.
[02:00:37.575 --> 02:00:46.160]  Guys, just watching this this morning, I didn't watch it last night, reminded me of the LBGTP stuff where they have stuff for middle schoolers
[02:00:46.809 --> 02:00:53.672]  Where it describes a little boy that has sex with adult men that pick him up at the park and have sex with him in a van.
[02:00:53.672 --> 02:00:57.914]  So they're teaching little boys to get in vans with men.
[02:00:57.914 --> 02:00:59.294]  So it's far beyond this.
[02:00:59.294 --> 02:01:01.615]  Hell, they have Career Day.
[02:01:01.615 --> 02:01:03.056]  I've got the local newscast.
[02:01:03.056 --> 02:01:06.297]  Today it was a drag queen from a local gay strip bar.
[02:01:06.297 --> 02:01:09.359]  They're teaching the middle schoolers how to make money.
[02:01:09.359 --> 02:01:14.341]  I mean, this is what goes on, okay?
[02:01:14.341 --> 02:01:14.441]  And
[02:01:15.422 --> 02:01:19.085]  It's a bunch of pedophiles, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:19.085 --> 02:01:31.034]  My God, Tony Podesta was in the Washington Post, 2007, in an avant-garde piece for only the DC paper version, showing images of babies tied up being gang-raped, okay?
[02:01:31.034 --> 02:01:33.276]  I can't even show it to you here on an adult show.
[02:01:33.276 --> 02:01:35.418]  The stations will kick us off the TV stations.
[02:01:35.418 --> 02:01:38.520]  But it's okay, though, for him to show the Washington Post his art.
[02:01:39.068 --> 02:01:40.751]  They're perverts.
[02:01:40.751 --> 02:01:42.393]  They're sickos.
[02:01:42.393 --> 02:01:43.535]  They're filth.
[02:01:43.535 --> 02:01:45.478]  They're into Aleister Crowley.
[02:01:45.478 --> 02:01:50.365]  And they make you wear a bib over your face and huff in bacteria.
[02:01:50.365 --> 02:01:51.547]  Your calls are one minute away.
[02:01:54.716 --> 02:01:59.904]  People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year?
[02:01:59.904 --> 02:02:07.955]  Because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year, it's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution.
[02:02:07.955 --> 02:02:11.060]  And not just that, fuel and every other major commodity.
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:13.421]  The globalists want a post-industrial world.
[02:02:13.421 --> 02:02:15.221]  They're hitting us with economic war.
[02:02:15.221 --> 02:02:16.782]  I told you food prices would explode.
[02:02:16.782 --> 02:02:17.922]  They're now exploding.
[02:02:17.922 --> 02:02:20.884]  Our great sponsor, MyPatriot, has barely gone up in price.
[02:02:20.884 --> 02:02:24.665]  Their competitors have gone up even more, but they're about to go up in two weeks.
[02:02:24.665 --> 02:02:31.387]  But instead of just holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening, and then it's got to go up.
[02:02:31.387 --> 02:02:32.788]  10% off at infowarestore.com.
[02:02:33.948 --> 02:02:36.550]  2020 prices in the year 2021.
[02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:41.473]  But you've got to act now and buying your food from us funds the inflow or a 360 win.
[02:02:41.473 --> 02:02:42.414]  It's ready to ship.
[02:02:42.414 --> 02:02:43.694]  They've got it on hand.
[02:02:43.694 --> 02:02:48.557]  Get yours before the scarcity and the lines start, which I think we'll see by next fall.
[02:02:48.557 --> 02:02:50.218]  Hell, a lot of shelves are already empty.
[02:02:50.218 --> 02:02:51.079]  This is crazy.
[02:02:51.079 --> 02:02:52.480]  We're being collapsed by design.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:53.320]  Get ready now.
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:54.521]  Prepare with alex.com.
[02:03:02.575 --> 02:03:04.656]  The Alex Jones Show!
[02:03:04.656 --> 02:03:07.637]  Because there's a war on, for your mind.
[02:03:07.637 --> 02:03:18.060]  Eh, we should change the tune a little bit happier.
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:18.340]  You know.
[02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:22.281]  Back to the Constitution, Bill O'Reilly.
[02:03:22.281 --> 02:03:24.102]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:03:24.102 --> 02:03:26.603]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.121]  That's quite the mix.
[02:03:34.121 --> 02:03:36.743]  You don't normally get Andy Griffith Show intro with Slayer.
[02:03:36.743 --> 02:03:42.367]  Rain blood.
[02:03:42.367 --> 02:03:44.208]  This rained air conditioner fluid on me.
[02:03:44.208 --> 02:03:46.089]  I said, rain blood.
[02:03:46.089 --> 02:03:46.990]  I drip once a month.
[02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:48.151]  All right.
[02:03:48.151 --> 02:03:53.995]  I think I'm going to go home and watch some Andy Griffith.
[02:03:53.995 --> 02:03:58.278]  I think I've watched all seasons about five times.
[02:03:58.278 --> 02:04:01.940]  I watch I Dream of Jeannie.
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:02.761]  I also watch
[02:04:04.264 --> 02:04:06.485]  Gilligan's Island.
[02:04:06.485 --> 02:04:08.967]  The stupider, the better.
[02:04:08.967 --> 02:04:14.289]  That's how I escape.
[02:04:14.289 --> 02:04:20.012]  My dad, though, you know, Don Knox was known as being quite the alley cat.
[02:04:20.012 --> 02:04:26.076]  And my dad was in high school at some big function in Dallas.
[02:04:26.076 --> 02:04:27.776]  And they were going up the elevator.
[02:04:27.776 --> 02:04:31.819]  And he said, Don Knox walked out with two of the hottest women my dad had ever seen.
[02:04:31.819 --> 02:04:32.419]  One on each arm.
[02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:35.734]  Anyways, little side story.
[02:04:35.734 --> 02:04:37.276]  Let's take your phone calls.
[02:04:37.276 --> 02:04:50.787]  Laura, Pat, DJ, Adam, OwlKiller, Trevor, Daryl, Taylor, Jeremy, and others.
[02:04:50.787 --> 02:04:54.510]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Arkansas.
[02:04:54.510 --> 02:04:55.391]  You're on the air, Matt.
[02:04:55.391 --> 02:04:55.671]  Welcome.
[02:04:57.392 --> 02:04:58.592]  Hey Alex, thanks.
[02:04:58.592 --> 02:05:00.373]  Great to talk to you.
[02:05:00.373 --> 02:05:08.416]  I would encourage everyone to watch that Tepper Carlson piece from last night because as parents here in Kansas, we're going through the exact same thing that those people are.
[02:05:08.416 --> 02:05:14.698]  We have a local state bill here that you can actually go to the schools.
[02:05:14.698 --> 02:05:22.141]  Sir, they have middle schools where they teach people all over the country, we started in Massachusetts, things I can't say on air.
[02:05:23.695 --> 02:05:25.976]  In fact, I was reading articles about this years ago.
[02:05:25.976 --> 02:05:30.198]  I learned about sexual things that I didn't know about as a grown man.
[02:05:30.198 --> 02:05:31.578]  Well, you'll find this interesting.
[02:05:31.578 --> 02:05:41.562]  So, during the course of these hearings, the school district kept basically daring the parents to sue them, because you can never get redress in these little hearings regarding the masks for the kids.
[02:05:41.562 --> 02:05:48.625]  So, we finally go to the hearing, of course it's denied, and five times during our hearing they said, okay, then your option is to sue us.
[02:05:48.625 --> 02:05:49.745]  So, we sued them.
[02:05:49.745 --> 02:05:51.426]  Well, guess, here's what's interesting.
[02:05:51.426 --> 02:05:52.206]  The school district
[02:05:53.155 --> 02:05:55.798]  Send the case to federal court.
[02:05:55.798 --> 02:06:00.221]  So I told our little volunteer lawyer, I was like, well, this makes me a little uncomfortable.
[02:06:00.221 --> 02:06:03.424]  Why would our local school district send this off to federal court?
[02:06:03.424 --> 02:06:06.507]  Because that stalls it while they continue suffocating your children.
[02:06:06.507 --> 02:06:10.050]  You need to call an emergency election and remove that school board.
[02:06:10.050 --> 02:06:10.811]  That is the answer.
[02:06:10.811 --> 02:06:13.814]  But yes, they use the rollout of kids can't go in schools.
[02:06:13.814 --> 02:06:15.375]  Kids can't go in middle schools.
[02:06:15.375 --> 02:06:16.336]  They can't go in elementary.
[02:06:16.336 --> 02:06:17.357]  They can't go in daycares.
[02:06:17.917 --> 02:06:21.720]  Because they're all in their teaching of the indoctrination right now.
[02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:23.681]  This is all their battle plan.
[02:06:23.681 --> 02:06:27.223]  On every front they moved against us, worldwide, with the COVID shutdown.
[02:06:27.223 --> 02:06:29.445]  I feel this better than anybody.
[02:06:29.445 --> 02:06:32.387]  Moving this to federal court, that's costing a fortune.
[02:06:32.387 --> 02:06:33.708]  And who wins?
[02:06:33.708 --> 02:06:35.149]  Say we win this lawsuit.
[02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:38.591]  Well, sir, all you do is you need to refile the suit again, over and over again.
[02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:41.491]  And the federal court should kick that back down.
[02:06:41.491 --> 02:06:42.972]  That's a local issue.
[02:06:42.972 --> 02:06:46.694]  They're trying to claim there's a federal mandate, but that's still administered.
[02:06:46.694 --> 02:06:48.075]  Those are guidelines.
[02:06:48.075 --> 02:06:48.816]  I appreciate your call.
[02:06:48.816 --> 02:06:49.516]  I can talk to everybody.
[02:06:49.516 --> 02:06:50.237]  Love you, Matt.
[02:06:50.237 --> 02:06:50.837]  I appreciate your call.
[02:06:50.837 --> 02:06:53.639]  But since you mentioned it, I never got this.
[02:06:53.639 --> 02:07:01.564]  This says, gay man in drag tells LGBT supporters, keep your kids out of drag queen shows.
[02:07:01.564 --> 02:07:03.525]  Yeah.
[02:07:03.525 --> 02:07:04.266]  And again,
[02:07:06.335 --> 02:07:08.976]  These are not dudes that look like women.
[02:07:08.976 --> 02:07:10.877]  They all look like hideous clowns.
[02:07:10.877 --> 02:07:15.138]  I mean, I'm not trying to be mean to this guy because he's homosexual.
[02:07:15.138 --> 02:07:20.080]  It's just that I would look hideous with white makeup on and a wig.
[02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:25.902]  And again, women bring their children to them like it's offerings and they sit on their laps.
[02:07:25.902 --> 02:07:27.622]  I mean, this is hideous.
[02:07:27.622 --> 02:07:31.804]  And now you see the videos of little kids up on stage having money thrown at them.
[02:07:31.804 --> 02:07:35.025]  So Tucker Carlson is playing mild stuff on his show.
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:48.022]  I have video shot in Austin of men with large genitals in Austin with five-year-old boys sitting on them.
[02:07:48.022 --> 02:07:53.403]  This is on, they post this!
[02:07:53.403 --> 02:07:59.024]  They're naked with children sitting on their laps that they don't even know.
[02:07:59.024 --> 02:08:01.905]  It's all about getting you ready for their takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:02.685 --> 02:08:04.507]  So here is this individual.
[02:08:04.507 --> 02:08:05.989]  This is a newswars.com article.
[02:08:05.989 --> 02:08:08.652]  A trending video shows a man in a clown outfit.
[02:08:08.652 --> 02:08:10.694]  I'm going to say gay man in drag.
[02:08:10.694 --> 02:08:12.776]  Again, these aren't drag queen story times.
[02:08:12.776 --> 02:08:14.678]  These are it the clown story times.
[02:08:14.678 --> 02:08:15.039]  Here it is.
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:19.401]  Telling people to keep their kids out of drag.
[02:08:19.401 --> 02:08:22.123]  And keep your kids out of our f***ing gay clubs.
[02:08:22.123 --> 02:08:23.344]  I saw that the other day.
[02:08:23.344 --> 02:08:26.946]  There was a video of these two kids walking down some drag show.
[02:08:26.946 --> 02:08:27.506]  Yeah.
[02:08:27.506 --> 02:08:33.230]  So I'm sort of blending the two messages together because I think at some point they do come together.
[02:08:33.230 --> 02:08:42.175]  Obviously, when we're seeing 12-year-olds dressed as girls and women, stripping for gay men, throwing them dollar bills on a stage, it's just, I don't know why we have to, us,
[02:08:42.816 --> 02:08:47.624]  Me as a homosexual has to tell people, keep your kids out of my life.
[02:08:47.624 --> 02:08:49.367]  You know, keep your kids innocent and pure.
[02:08:50.223 --> 02:08:51.244]  As long as you can.
[02:08:51.244 --> 02:08:53.486]  And you know, they'll discover their own sex life.
[02:08:53.486 --> 02:08:55.428]  They'll discover their own sexuality.
[02:08:55.428 --> 02:08:56.929]  And drag's not a sexuality.
[02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:58.050]  It's an art form.
[02:08:58.050 --> 02:09:00.792]  What do you feel about the whole story hour?
[02:09:00.792 --> 02:09:02.234]  Drag Queen story hour?
[02:09:02.234 --> 02:09:03.395]  Oh, I think it's stupid.
[02:09:03.395 --> 02:09:04.496]  I think it's damaging.
[02:09:04.496 --> 02:09:07.658]  I think it will actually lead to more confusion of gay children.
[02:09:07.658 --> 02:09:11.161]  Yeah, why do you have to weigh 400 pounds to dress like a woman?
[02:09:11.161 --> 02:09:12.783]  Listen, I'm not trying to be mean here.
[02:09:13.283 --> 02:09:15.265]  Oh, I'm saying, people are like, hey, praise this guy.
[02:09:15.265 --> 02:09:22.790]  Praise Caitlyn Jenner, Bruce Jenner, because he said, don't have biological men competing with women.
[02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:30.775]  And now it's like, oh, you're dressed like a girl, but he's like, oh, but the election wasn't stolen, and we need open borders, and turn your guns, and everybody's like, all the Republicans are like, yes, master.
[02:09:30.775 --> 02:09:32.096]  Yes, master.
[02:09:32.096 --> 02:09:33.337]  Yes, master.
[02:09:33.337 --> 02:09:35.299]  Whatever you say, you're a man.
[02:09:35.299 --> 02:09:38.721]  Says he's a woman, yes, master.
[02:09:38.721 --> 02:09:42.664]  Yes, I mean, it's disgusting, in that I'm supposed to worship it.
[02:09:45.146 --> 02:09:46.526]  And they're forcing on our children.
[02:09:46.526 --> 02:09:50.807]  And yes, the same thing is what that clown person was saying.
[02:09:50.807 --> 02:09:58.149]  So even crazy clowns... Even crazy clowns are right.
[02:09:58.149 --> 02:10:00.990]  You should keep your children away from topless bars.
[02:10:00.990 --> 02:10:01.630]  God Almighty.
[02:10:01.630 --> 02:10:05.611]  Imagine if you walked into a topless bar and they had like a 10-year-old girl up there having money thrown at them.
[02:10:05.611 --> 02:10:07.071]  You'd call the police.
[02:10:07.071 --> 02:10:10.792]  But if it's a gay bar, it's like, oh my goodness, it's so liberal.
[02:10:10.792 --> 02:10:13.293]  I mean, again, Tim Cook runs death camps in China.
[02:10:14.514 --> 02:10:15.875]  Hey Alex, how you doing, brother?
[02:10:15.875 --> 02:10:19.217]  Hey, first thing, I wanted to give you kudos for your two young hosts.
[02:10:19.217 --> 02:10:26.381]  When you first brought them on, I was really wondering what you were doing, but I tell you what, those two are worth their weight in gold.
[02:10:44.491 --> 02:10:48.594]  And speaking of gold, I want to promote Infowarsgold.com.
[02:10:48.594 --> 02:10:55.078]  Everybody needs to get their gold and silver now before the whole economy crashes and the dollar ain't worth nothing.
[02:10:55.078 --> 02:11:09.869]  Second thing, Alex, I want to say that you need to sometimes turn around, since you are the tip of the spear, and look at the other eight inches of blade and the five inches of shaft behind you, because you have a patriotic army that is behind you.
[02:11:09.869 --> 02:11:10.890]  We are supporting you.
[02:11:10.890 --> 02:11:12.771]  We are praying for you.
[02:11:12.771 --> 02:11:14.012]  Brother, we are here for you.
[02:11:14.532 --> 02:11:22.458]  And I want, like Elijah, I pray that God will open your eyes and you will see the legion of angels that are surrounding our enemies right now.
[02:11:22.458 --> 02:11:23.839]  They are not going to win.
[02:11:23.839 --> 02:11:27.161]  They might win a battle here and there, but the war is ours.
[02:11:27.161 --> 02:11:30.083]  We are the children of God, and they are not going to win.
[02:11:30.083 --> 02:11:31.504]  They are not going to overcome.
[02:11:31.504 --> 02:11:34.166]  We are more than conquerors in the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:11:35.083 --> 02:11:36.084]  Brother, I do agree.
[02:11:36.084 --> 02:11:39.405]  I love the listeners, who are just as important as I am, or more important.
[02:11:39.405 --> 02:11:44.207]  And absolutely, you know, Harrison Smith's a smart guy, Owen's a smart guy, they're great guys.
[02:11:44.207 --> 02:11:46.028]  And they're better than I am in a lot of ways on air.
[02:11:46.028 --> 02:11:51.811]  And they're also there to have guests on, and to have calls, and to have more larger crew here.
[02:11:51.811 --> 02:11:59.515]  Because I'd like to be live 24 hours a day, if we can get the crew, if we can hire the people that'll do it and get the job done.
[02:11:59.515 --> 02:12:01.256]  And so, thank you so much, brother.
[02:12:01.256 --> 02:12:01.856]  Anything else?
[02:12:03.343 --> 02:12:03.623]  That's it.
[02:12:03.623 --> 02:12:07.465]  I just wanted to call and encourage you to keep fighting a good fight and we got your back, brother.
[02:12:07.465 --> 02:12:09.025]  We got your six.
[02:12:09.025 --> 02:12:09.946]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:12:09.946 --> 02:12:10.746]  God bless you.
[02:12:10.746 --> 02:12:15.488]  Yeah, I'm just trying to look for people that are good to support us and to be with us.
[02:12:15.488 --> 02:12:18.169]  I mean, like, take Infowarsgold.com.
[02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:19.090]  That's St.
[02:12:19.090 --> 02:12:20.250]  Joseph Partners.
[02:12:20.250 --> 02:12:21.070]  They're great.
[02:12:21.070 --> 02:12:26.473]  They make almost no profit on the gold, so they have to sell a lot to be able to even sponsor us.
[02:12:27.871 --> 02:12:28.832]  It is a big idea.
[02:12:56.565 --> 02:13:00.489]  A new world order.
[02:13:00.489 --> 02:13:05.414]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:13:05.414 --> 02:13:08.237]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[02:13:08.237 --> 02:13:11.100]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:13.523]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:13:14.412 --> 02:13:22.594]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:13:22.594 --> 02:13:25.234]  The globalists feared this film made 14 years ago.
[02:13:25.234 --> 02:13:27.454]  It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[02:13:27.454 --> 02:13:28.895]  It is the blueprint for the Great Reset.
[02:13:28.895 --> 02:13:29.955]  It is, in-game.
[02:13:29.955 --> 02:13:31.215]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:13:31.215 --> 02:13:37.216]  Available right now at mfulmorestore.com with a zero country code, meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[02:13:37.216 --> 02:13:41.017]  I strongly suggest you get the film, in-game, at mfulmorestore.com.
[02:13:41.457 --> 02:13:43.678]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it.
[02:13:43.678 --> 02:13:49.041]  And if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[02:13:49.041 --> 02:13:53.424]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[02:13:54.093 --> 02:14:08.938]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia, with no evidence, for the shutdown of the East Coast gasoline pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast.
[02:14:08.938 --> 02:14:18.461]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and sent to the East Coast?
[02:14:18.461 --> 02:14:23.423]  That's right, Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed.
[02:14:23.903 --> 02:14:26.085]  Joe Biden did that to America.
[02:14:26.085 --> 02:14:27.185]  He has the history.
[02:14:27.185 --> 02:14:28.306]  He has the background.
[02:14:28.306 --> 02:14:31.568]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[02:14:31.568 --> 02:14:35.691]  He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[02:14:35.691 --> 02:14:39.994]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world.
[02:14:39.994 --> 02:14:45.558]  And they want the United States, Europe, and Australia crippled so Communist China can be dominant.
[02:14:45.558 --> 02:14:47.099]  It's not Russia that's the enemy.
[02:14:47.099 --> 02:14:51.422]  It's Communist China and their millions, like Joe Biden, in control of the White House.
[02:14:51.422 --> 02:14:52.542]  That's the facts.
[02:14:52.542 --> 02:14:53.443]  That's the information.
[02:14:56.745 --> 02:15:14.659]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:14.659 --> 02:15:20.443]  Our lead producer, Scott, just came in here and he said, Alex, you gotta remember, it's not always how you fight,
[02:15:21.593 --> 02:15:22.413]  That's the most important.
[02:15:22.413 --> 02:15:25.474]  It's what you're fighting for.
[02:15:25.474 --> 02:15:26.014]  And that's true.
[02:15:26.014 --> 02:15:35.576]  We should enjoy our lives, enjoy our families, enjoy God's creation, and really thank God for things just every second.
[02:15:35.576 --> 02:15:40.478]  Because that is what Communion with God is all about, is the worship of God.
[02:15:40.478 --> 02:15:47.899]  And that just means the dialing in, and the plugging into it, and the appreciation of it, and just that connection is the worship.
[02:15:47.899 --> 02:15:50.460]  The worship isn't just getting on your knees, it's the connecting.
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:56.641]  And you better humble yourself when you jack into that.
[02:15:56.641 --> 02:16:07.126]  So let's go back to your phone calls here as we cover the incredible things unfolding on this planet.
[02:16:07.126 --> 02:16:10.707]  Let's talk to DJ in New Jersey.
[02:16:10.707 --> 02:16:14.629]  DJ in New Jersey, thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:22.152]  In New York, and I just wanted to share with you a tragic experience I'm going through with my family right now.
[02:16:23.058 --> 02:16:25.959]  Related to the vaccine.
[02:16:25.959 --> 02:16:45.205]  And before I get into that, I just want to thank you so much, Alex, because I suffer with more gallons and I have been able to sustain myself because of all the nutrients that I get from you, the pharmaceuticals that I purchase regularly.
[02:16:45.205 --> 02:16:51.407]  And I came into a knowledge of nanotech because of my suffering with this condition.
[02:16:52.558 --> 02:16:59.881]  And it was very horrible in the beginning, and your various ones, I don't need to name them all, but I'm on a lot of them right now.
[02:16:59.881 --> 02:17:02.302]  They really make a difference for me.
[02:17:02.302 --> 02:17:07.484]  So, to get into my story, I have an uncle who lives in New Jersey.
[02:17:07.484 --> 02:17:14.507]  He is pretty well known in the pharmaceutical realm.
[02:17:14.507 --> 02:17:20.449]  He developed the primary medicine for Parkinson's disease called L-DOPA.
[02:17:21.927 --> 02:17:26.169]  And he also created three different classes of cardiac medicines.
[02:17:26.169 --> 02:17:29.331]  He's a very accomplished scientist.
[02:17:29.331 --> 02:17:39.036]  And his story, I could go into another time if you wanted to hear, but what the pharmaceutical industry did to him, you would think he would never ever trust them again.
[02:17:39.036 --> 02:17:41.398]  And he took the Pfizer shot.
[02:17:41.398 --> 02:17:46.741]  And when he got the second shot, he developed a horrible pneumonia.
[02:17:46.741 --> 02:17:51.103]  Now he's 98 years old, was a vibrant, healthy man for many years.
[02:17:52.370 --> 02:17:56.911]  Uh, exercised a lot, was driving around in his pickup truck until just recently.
[02:17:56.911 --> 02:17:59.492]  That's how healthy and sturdy he's been.
[02:17:59.492 --> 02:18:05.434]  Okay, so, I spoke to him this morning to find out how he's doing, and he said, not good.
[02:18:05.434 --> 02:18:07.794]  I said, well, what's going on?
[02:18:07.794 --> 02:18:14.136]  He said, you know, I feel worse and worse, and I can't get any help from these doctors here.
[02:18:14.136 --> 02:18:18.997]  I said, well, they're not going to really help you because some of them don't even really know what's going on with this.
[02:18:18.997 --> 02:18:21.018]  They're not educated about it.
[02:18:21.917 --> 02:18:35.560]  And so I started to teach him from the layperson that I am and what I've learned and studied about the spike proteins and how they replicate just like other nanotechnology self-replicates.
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:40.602]  And then I told him it's going to block your ability of your immune system to fight anything.
[02:18:40.602 --> 02:18:40.942]  That's it?
[02:18:40.942 --> 02:18:43.762]  It's going to continue to replicate until it kills him?
[02:18:43.762 --> 02:18:44.763]  That's right.
[02:18:44.763 --> 02:18:50.184]  And I just want to run over there with some DNA force, with some
[02:18:51.834 --> 02:18:58.059]  I'm not a medical doctor and I've had some on and that's a big question.
[02:18:58.059 --> 02:19:08.107]  We know vitamins and minerals to stop regular COVID, but once your body attacks the cell with a spike protein, that's really beyond an autoimmune response.
[02:19:08.107 --> 02:19:11.370]  It's attacking you at the cellular level and we know it killed the rats that took it.
[02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:14.401]  And so, we know it attacks their lungs.
[02:19:14.401 --> 02:19:21.964]  That was the main way the rats died in the major University of Texas study funded by Fauci, was it ate holes in their lungs.
[02:19:21.964 --> 02:19:25.325]  And so, let me ask this doctor that's coming on.
[02:19:25.325 --> 02:19:30.807]  I'm going to ask her, because that's what she's coming on about, is people dying from the vaccine to go to the hospital.
[02:19:30.807 --> 02:19:32.528]  They're then saying they had COVID.
[02:19:32.528 --> 02:19:35.649]  But God bless you, DJ, and I appreciate your call.
[02:19:35.649 --> 02:19:35.789]  Wow.
[02:19:36.969 --> 02:19:37.709]  Now, there it is.
[02:19:37.709 --> 02:19:43.690]  Increasing number of post-SPARS pneumonia cases reported across the country of those that had taken the vaccine.
[02:19:43.690 --> 02:19:46.311]  That's in SPARS 25, 28.
[02:19:46.311 --> 02:19:49.692]  So 26 is in 2021, which is this year.
[02:19:49.692 --> 02:19:51.412]  So they war game it all out in live time.
[02:19:51.412 --> 02:19:54.893]  As General Flynn said, it's definitely a war game of what's currently happening.
[02:19:54.893 --> 02:19:55.913]  They just set it in the future.
[02:19:55.913 --> 02:19:58.113]  So they have a manual how to launch the attack.
[02:19:58.113 --> 02:20:00.334]  But if they get caught, they go, oh, this is just a drill.
[02:20:00.334 --> 02:20:02.294]  This is just a scenario.
[02:20:02.294 --> 02:20:04.094]  That's out of John Hopkins.
[02:20:04.094 --> 02:20:05.675]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:20:05.675 --> 02:20:06.335]  Is it Ben?
[02:20:07.193 --> 02:20:08.973]  Is it Jack who's been on the longest here?
[02:20:08.973 --> 02:20:10.954]  Is it Adam?
[02:20:10.954 --> 02:20:12.754]  Taylor?
[02:20:12.754 --> 02:20:17.375]  Let's talk to Taylor in Florida on the same subject of a recent study on spike protein.
[02:20:17.375 --> 02:20:20.236]  Go ahead and tell us about it Taylor.
[02:20:20.236 --> 02:20:22.856]  Hey Alex, I hope you're doing well.
[02:20:22.856 --> 02:20:31.478]  So recently I was doing some research online and I came across this study from the American Heart Association that from my understanding found that
[02:20:33.274 --> 02:20:38.457]  The spike protein alone is enough to damage lung tissue.
[02:20:38.457 --> 02:20:47.744]  I believe what they did was they isolated the spike protein and they introduced it to one lung tissue, left one alone.
[02:20:47.744 --> 02:20:52.467]  Lung tissue that was introduced to the spike protein became heavily damaged and
[02:20:53.823 --> 02:20:55.104]  You know, diseased.
[02:20:55.104 --> 02:21:04.031]  And that's what happened with the mice, and that's what happened in over 50 studies we know of, and you just heard the guy whose uncle's dying with his lungs right now after the vaccine.
[02:21:04.031 --> 02:21:05.152]  Yeah.
[02:21:05.152 --> 02:21:06.032]  Yeah.
[02:21:06.032 --> 02:21:17.141]  And my concern is that people are getting these shots, they're getting these jabs, and if they're getting Johnson & Johnson, they're just getting spike protein directly injected into their body.
[02:21:17.141 --> 02:21:22.465]  If they're getting Pfizer or Moderna, then their body is learning to produce spike protein
[02:21:23.247 --> 02:21:34.476]  And with all these people that are now going to have spike proteins introduced to their body, how long is it until we see people develop lung diseases, people not able to breathe, people dying?
[02:21:34.476 --> 02:21:45.864]  And why aren't our politicians, people like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, even Ron Sanchez, great, you know, great politicians, but even they encourage people to get the vaccine and they talk about it.
[02:21:46.414 --> 02:21:47.395]  As if it's a good thing.
[02:21:47.395 --> 02:21:48.355]  So what do we do?
[02:21:48.355 --> 02:21:49.876]  How do we encourage them or show?
[02:21:49.876 --> 02:21:55.698]  Well, that's because they wanted to get things reopened and they were told was just a regular pause right there, guys.
[02:21:55.698 --> 02:21:58.079]  You found it right there for TV viewers.
[02:21:58.079 --> 02:21:59.680]  And they didn't understand all these studies.
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:02.762]  And then now, once they say, take it, they don't want to admit they were wrong.
[02:22:02.762 --> 02:22:04.502]  But there it is.
[02:22:04.502 --> 02:22:06.663]  They did biopsies.
[02:22:06.663 --> 02:22:13.066]  They did autopsies on the mice and rats after and they show the groups that were not given the three vaccines.
[02:22:13.066 --> 02:22:14.407]  They did three control groups.
[02:22:15.106 --> 02:22:26.610]  They did three groups of rats that they gave the vaccine to, three groups of rats they did, three different vaccines, all different types of COVID coronavirus vaccines.
[02:22:26.610 --> 02:22:34.753]  And you can see that, again, the mice that were given it had their lungs eaten into bloody pulps, and then those that didn't had no problem in their lungs.
[02:22:34.753 --> 02:22:36.613]  So, exactly what you're talking about.
[02:22:36.613 --> 02:22:40.875]  What's the name of the American Heart Association study you're talking about, so I can pull it up?
[02:22:42.113 --> 02:22:43.454]  Let me try to find it.
[02:22:43.454 --> 02:22:45.936]  I had just searched it up on the call.
[02:22:45.936 --> 02:22:48.457]  It is... give me one second.
[02:22:48.457 --> 02:22:49.818]  It's okay.
[02:22:49.818 --> 02:22:56.723]  It is called SARS-CoV-2 spike protein impairs endothelial function via down regular of ACE2.
[02:22:56.723 --> 02:22:59.485]  Yeah, I think I've seen that one.
[02:22:59.485 --> 02:23:00.906]  There's over 50 I've seen.
[02:23:00.906 --> 02:23:01.286]  Say it again.
[02:23:01.286 --> 02:23:03.327]  We're going to pull it up.
[02:23:03.327 --> 02:23:04.748]  All right, so one more time.
[02:23:04.748 --> 02:23:08.631]  It is SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
[02:23:09.376 --> 02:23:16.978]  All right.
[02:23:16.978 --> 02:23:17.618]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:17.618 --> 02:23:18.258]  There it is.
[02:23:18.258 --> 02:23:25.040]  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein impairs endothelial function via downregulation of ACE2.
[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:26.600]  Nothing like getting your lungs eaten.
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:27.741]  Sorry for that fellow's uncle.
[02:23:27.741 --> 02:23:28.701]  All right.
[02:23:28.701 --> 02:23:29.441]  God bless you, sir.
[02:23:30.845 --> 02:23:37.428]  Yep, and the mass death's gonna begin, and I figure by next winter, they're gonna claim there's a new bioweapon, a new thing out that's doing it.
[02:23:37.428 --> 02:23:38.308]  And of course, it won't be that.
[02:23:38.308 --> 02:23:39.929]  It'll be the vaccine that did it.
[02:23:39.929 --> 02:23:41.230]  And so, brace yourselves, folks.
[02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:43.391]  They're letting you think that, oh, everything's okay for a minute.
[02:23:43.391 --> 02:23:46.012]  Then they're gonna sucker punch you again with everything they got.
[02:23:46.012 --> 02:23:49.333]  Warrior Call's coming up, and a special guest is popping in.
[02:23:49.333 --> 02:23:53.075]  Stay with us.
[02:23:53.075 --> 02:23:59.478]  I'm not gonna sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes InfoWars has had.
[02:24:00.382 --> 02:24:03.665]  If you're paying attention, you know what we've done together.
[02:24:03.665 --> 02:24:05.987]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:24:05.987 --> 02:24:09.770]  The technocrats are really upping their game.
[02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:13.653]  And they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[02:24:13.653 --> 02:24:16.055]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[02:24:16.055 --> 02:24:21.680]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:25.062]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to have to be true.
[02:24:25.062 --> 02:24:27.605]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[02:24:27.605 --> 02:24:28.946]  The power structure is in the silence.
[02:24:29.756 --> 02:24:31.978]  Those of us that they can't.
[02:24:31.978 --> 02:24:36.563]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[02:24:36.563 --> 02:24:38.285]  We have the power.
[02:24:38.285 --> 02:24:42.609]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[02:24:42.609 --> 02:24:48.195]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't come.
[02:24:48.195 --> 02:24:49.296]  So be the polar bears you are.
[02:24:53.749 --> 02:24:58.090]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[02:24:58.090 --> 02:25:08.692]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[02:25:08.692 --> 02:25:14.873]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:25:14.873 --> 02:25:22.974]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep, but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[02:25:23.434 --> 02:25:33.517]  Many competitors sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[02:25:33.517 --> 02:25:41.340]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:46.041]  Rocket Rest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep, and wake up feeling rested.
[02:25:46.041 --> 02:25:51.123]  So get the new Rocket Rest formula from Dr. Jones Naturals right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:25:54.136 --> 02:26:01.948]  The Globalists comprise the oldest and richest families on Earth, and they have brought down hundreds and hundreds of nations over the last thousand years.
[02:26:01.948 --> 02:26:09.599]  They have bankrupted once successful countries all across the world, and they've used the same formulas of civil unrest.
[02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:11.481]  And Civil War.
[02:26:11.481 --> 02:26:16.242]  And they're doing it again to the United States of America and Europe right now.
[02:26:16.242 --> 02:26:26.186]  Bringing in giant third world populations and then brainwashing them and turning them against the country that they wanted to emigrate to because they knew it was better and had more freedom and more opportunity.
[02:26:26.186 --> 02:26:29.487]  Ladies and gentlemen, America is under scientific attack.
[02:26:29.487 --> 02:26:38.210]  And it's time now more than ever to raise the alarm and warn everyone you know about what's really happening and at the same time get prepared in case things continue to go south like they are.
[02:26:38.490 --> 02:26:46.656]  One of the smartest moves out there is to get high quality, storable food so that as inflation goes up, it's a way to defeat the inflation and have insurance you can eat.
[02:26:46.656 --> 02:26:52.660]  So we've extended the sale through this Sunday at 10% off all storable foods at preparewithalex.com.
[02:26:53.667 --> 02:26:57.049]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[02:26:57.049 --> 02:27:06.955]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalists attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[02:27:06.955 --> 02:27:10.317]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[02:27:10.317 --> 02:27:18.342]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[02:27:19.302 --> 02:27:22.746]  People are really, really awake in the establishment.
[02:27:22.746 --> 02:27:25.709]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared.
[02:27:25.709 --> 02:27:27.390]  They're looking for leadership.
[02:27:27.390 --> 02:27:29.392]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[02:27:29.392 --> 02:27:30.353]  You fund us.
[02:27:30.353 --> 02:27:31.915]  You support InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:27:31.915 --> 02:27:33.816]  We get great products to you at the same time.
[02:27:33.816 --> 02:27:34.457]  We will then go
[02:27:34.577 --> 02:27:36.759]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:28:11.363 --> 02:28:20.065]  Emergency folks, Dr. Jane Ruby is here with us and it's very synchronicity, serendipity, fortuitous.
[02:28:20.065 --> 02:28:31.348]  We just had a caller bring up the very study she was coming on about SARS-CoV-2 spike protein impairs epithelial function via down regulation of ACE2.
[02:28:31.348 --> 02:28:32.268]  She'll put that in
[02:28:33.792 --> 02:28:37.013]  Easy to understand jargon for myself and I guess a lot of other people.
[02:28:37.013 --> 02:28:43.636]  Dr. Jane Ruby is a Washington, D.C., health economist and New Right political pundit who hosts a weeknight show.
[02:28:43.636 --> 02:28:45.736]  A Sea of New Media also is her book.
[02:28:45.736 --> 02:28:49.858]  It illustrates the emergence of a new generation of journalists and truth-tellers.

[02:28:51.439 --> 02:28:52.179]  And she's been a guest.
[02:28:52.179 --> 02:28:53.019]  She's guest-hosted.
[02:28:53.019 --> 02:28:55.460]  She does just a wonderful job.
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:58.581]  And she had me on this in a few weeks, so she's got a lot of updates for us.
[02:28:58.581 --> 02:29:00.502]  But this study, thanks to you and others,
[02:29:01.062 --> 02:29:04.666]  It's really starting to get a lot of attention.
[02:29:04.666 --> 02:29:08.349]  Break down why it's so important.
[02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:10.030]  Yeah, it's great to be back, Alex.
[02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:11.912]  And, you know, kudos to your audience.
[02:29:11.912 --> 02:29:16.576]  That's a very sharp audience member to be tracking this kind of study.
[02:29:16.576 --> 02:29:26.165]  The reason this study is such a bombshell is because it explains the relationship now between these experimental injections
[02:29:26.665 --> 02:29:38.434]  And the rapidly surging occurrence of the dangerous thrombosis thrombocytopenia, which is sort of a simultaneous situation of blood clots and bleeding in the body.
[02:29:38.434 --> 02:29:44.378]  And the culprit, as this study now shows, is the spike protein.
[02:29:44.378 --> 02:29:46.580]  And let me just review for the audience.
[02:29:47.341 --> 02:29:48.642]  We've talked before.
[02:29:48.642 --> 02:29:50.605]  These injections are not true.
[02:29:50.605 --> 02:29:52.087]  They're not vaccines.
[02:29:52.087 --> 02:29:58.695]  They do not stimulate your body to develop antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
[02:29:58.695 --> 02:30:02.681]  And so what they do is they actually force your body
[02:30:03.181 --> 02:30:18.035]  To utilize your own DNA as material, blueprint material, to create the spike proteins, you know, those angry little red T things that are depicted around the circular shell, which everybody is calling the virus.
[02:30:18.035 --> 02:30:20.738]  Let me tell you what these researchers did that was brilliant.
[02:30:21.638 --> 02:30:30.101]  They used mice, knockout mice, that are, it's a term for mice that are actually prepared to reflect human reaction.
[02:30:30.101 --> 02:30:44.285]  What they did, Alex, was they took an empty shell, if you will, molecularly, and they just, no virus inside, no material, and they just put these protein spikes around them, and then they injected them into the mice.
[02:30:44.945 --> 02:30:45.366]  Thank you.
[02:31:02.797 --> 02:31:08.479]  It's causing all this damage and so now we have that connection.
[02:31:08.479 --> 02:31:13.781]  We know that the body is being forced to make millions and millions of these spike proteins.
[02:31:13.781 --> 02:31:26.546]  I've explained before on your show that there are amino acid components within these spike proteins that are recognizable in other parts of your body that are necessary and so those proteins are being attacked.
[02:31:27.498 --> 02:31:29.721]  By the way, we also have a bunch of other studies.
[02:31:48.020 --> 02:32:08.834]  Level 4 bioweapons research facility in Galveston under a Dr. Fauci direct grant in 2012 with mice found the exact same thing and they said do not develop a vaccine for humans perceived with extreme caution in the conclusion because it killed the mice and rats by eating holes in their lungs.
[02:32:08.834 --> 02:32:10.876]  The same thing this other study shows.
[02:32:10.876 --> 02:32:14.458]  So Fauci knew directly what he was paying for what he was doing.
[02:32:14.458 --> 02:32:16.700]  I mean to me this shows this is premeditated.
[02:32:18.470 --> 02:32:28.876]  I'll tell you, from a scientific standpoint, Alex, this looks like... I just can't believe that all of this was created by coincidence or accident.
[02:32:28.876 --> 02:32:43.705]  It looks like they intentionally... Well, first of all, by driving your body to make spike proteins, not antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that was the first clue that something was intentional here.
[02:32:43.705 --> 02:32:48.048]  Because it's a deviation from the traditional approach in developing a vaccine.
[02:32:48.448 --> 02:32:57.931]  This is why Dr. David Martin, who I had on your show last week, and countless others like Dr. Tenpenny, all of these doctors will tell you this is not a vaccine.
[02:32:57.931 --> 02:33:05.594]  A vaccine results in your body developing a surveillance system of antibodies that not only recognize but then go out and kill.
[02:33:05.594 --> 02:33:09.055]  And the former chief scientist at Pfizer over vaccines
[02:33:09.855 --> 02:33:17.202]  Send a huge letter with Wolfgang Woodhugger, as you know, on December 1st, saying this is going to attack these proteins in the placenta, the heart, the brain.
[02:33:17.202 --> 02:33:19.965]  This looks like a depopulation weapon, he said.
[02:33:19.965 --> 02:33:24.770]  So that's mainline top scientists that used to head Pfizer's science division.
[02:33:24.770 --> 02:33:27.232]  So, I mean, this is purely premeditated.
[02:33:27.232 --> 02:33:28.213]  This is so frightening.
[02:33:30.103 --> 02:33:31.904]  Alex, it's incredibly frightening.
[02:33:31.904 --> 02:33:34.206]  I keep telling people to wait.
[02:33:34.206 --> 02:33:42.932]  People write to me all the time, especially after being on your show, and they ask me, am I getting this transmitted to me from my spouse who got the shot?
[02:33:42.932 --> 02:33:45.653]  Are my children in danger if I already got the shot?
[02:33:45.653 --> 02:33:51.237]  The reason I'm telling people to wait is this information is just coming in, like this study that we're talking about.
[02:33:52.097 --> 02:33:59.581]  It just came out on April 30th because it takes a while for peer-reviewed journals to approve them.
[02:33:59.581 --> 02:34:03.463]  They have to be vetted by other scientists who don't have a dog in the race.
[02:34:03.463 --> 02:34:11.567]  This was published in the journal Circulation, which is a very high-ranking peer-reviewed journal in cardiopulmonary medicine.
[02:34:11.567 --> 02:34:17.691]  And that's why they skipped the animal trials because they'd already done them with similar vaccines and skipped the human trials.
[02:34:17.691 --> 02:34:20.072]  They sucker-punched us!
[02:34:20.072 --> 02:34:20.232]  Yep.
[02:34:21.112 --> 02:34:23.595]  Yeah, it sure looks like they did, Alex.
[02:34:23.595 --> 02:34:35.789]  I can't imagine what's going to come out next, but I think the design of this study that we're looking at now, it shows that when they went back and looked at the lung tissue and some of the brain tissue of these mice,
[02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.930]  We're good to go.
[02:34:56.804 --> 02:34:59.765]  Endothelial tissue in your blood vessels.
[02:34:59.765 --> 02:35:03.406]  Endothelial is just a big fancy word for cellular lining.
[02:35:03.406 --> 02:35:05.826]  So your blood vessels are very smooth.
[02:35:05.826 --> 02:35:18.670]  A healthy blood vessel is very smooth, shiny in the inside because blood travels at a very high velocity and it's very sensitive to any blockages or any damage to the lining of your blood vessels.
[02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:23.611]  These spike proteins actually damage, they mechanically, you can see it on the electron microscope.
[02:35:23.991 --> 02:35:30.815]  They're damaging the inside lining of the blood vessels, and when blood flies by, blood components get caught.
[02:35:30.815 --> 02:35:32.777]  Platelets, other types of red blood cells.
[02:35:32.777 --> 02:35:33.037]  That's right.
[02:35:33.037 --> 02:35:37.300]  The platelets build up, you get a plaque build up, and you have a heart attack or stroke, or you bleed out the lungs.
[02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:41.462]  In fact, you're saying, I've seen a lot of these studies, it's conclusive.
[02:35:41.462 --> 02:35:43.283]  Why is it attacking the lungs particularly?
[02:35:43.283 --> 02:35:45.545]  Is that because there's so many little blood vessels in there?
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:51.441]  It has to do with the ACE2 receptors that you see in the title of this study.
[02:35:51.441 --> 02:35:53.682]  They're ubiquitous in the lung.
[02:35:53.682 --> 02:36:00.144]  They're ubiquitous throughout the body, but they're really prolific and I think that there's maybe an affinity.
[02:36:00.144 --> 02:36:07.666]  Originally, they thought this was a respiratory illness and a lot of doctors, including Dr. Michael Yeadon, the former Pfizer VP of Science,
[02:36:08.106 --> 02:36:08.406]  Thank you.
[02:36:24.557 --> 02:36:32.942]  Sure, so the virus itself has a toxic spike protein that can hurt the lungs and other things, but then when you vaccinate for it, it makes it a hundred times worse.
[02:36:32.942 --> 02:36:42.627]  Which is what we're seeing is now most of the people in the hospitals already had the vaccine and they're just calling it COVID now and saying, well, you still got COVID despite the vaccine, when really it's vaccine.
[02:36:43.832 --> 02:36:44.293]  Right.
[02:36:44.293 --> 02:36:54.481]  And don't forget, all four of these companies that are currently under the Emergency Use Authorization result in the same thing, excess spike production.
[02:36:54.481 --> 02:36:57.884]  AstraZeneca and J&J go about it a little bit differently.
[02:36:57.884 --> 02:37:01.908]  They use an adenovirus delivery system, but it's all the same.
[02:37:01.908 --> 02:37:04.050]  Let me ask you a quick question.
[02:37:04.050 --> 02:37:08.574]  From your research, does anyone know this early yet, which vaccine is the most dangerous?
[02:37:10.370 --> 02:37:11.610]  I don't think we can say.
[02:37:11.610 --> 02:37:12.731]  I'll tell you why.
[02:37:12.731 --> 02:37:21.273]  Because all four of them get to the same place, which is to force your body to rapidly and over-replicate these spike proteins.
[02:37:21.273 --> 02:37:23.814]  Now, here's the dangerous part I'm going to leave you with.
[02:37:23.814 --> 02:37:31.856]  People, and we can talk about it another time, people, these illnesses are going to come out sort of generally over the next few years.
[02:37:32.376 --> 02:37:33.857]  Oh no, you must have been confused.
[02:37:33.857 --> 02:37:37.640]  Stu's going to be hosting the next hour, so he's just popping in.
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:38.721]  We're going to hand the ball off to him.
[02:37:38.721 --> 02:37:39.642]  We've got one more segment.
[02:37:39.642 --> 02:37:40.202]  Can you stay there?
[02:37:40.202 --> 02:37:41.203]  Sure.
[02:37:41.203 --> 02:37:42.084]  Fantastic, Doc.
[02:37:42.084 --> 02:37:43.605]  Okay, wow.
[02:37:43.605 --> 02:37:45.226]  This could not be more important.
[02:37:45.226 --> 02:37:46.607]  We'll be back after this quick break.
[02:37:46.607 --> 02:37:48.069]  Dr. Jane Ruby is here.
[02:37:48.069 --> 02:37:49.650]  DrJaneRuby.com.
[02:37:49.650 --> 02:37:52.292]  And we've got the fellow I saw her on with coming up.
[02:37:53.945 --> 02:37:55.727]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[02:37:55.727 --> 02:37:58.071]  You're on the air.
[02:37:58.071 --> 02:37:58.752]  Thanks for holding.
[02:37:58.752 --> 02:38:05.761]  Hey Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[02:38:05.761 --> 02:38:07.083]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:38:09.766 --> 02:38:11.207]  I just want to plug in.
[02:38:11.207 --> 02:38:15.630]  I'm a truck driver and two of the fours have changed the way I drive.
[02:38:15.630 --> 02:38:22.275]  Me and my brothers that drive and a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[02:38:22.275 --> 02:38:30.861]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[02:38:31.041 --> 02:38:36.704]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[02:38:36.704 --> 02:38:38.985]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[02:38:38.985 --> 02:38:44.108]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[02:38:44.108 --> 02:38:48.150]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:50.672]  And you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me.
[02:38:50.672 --> 02:38:51.032]  Thank you.
[02:38:51.032 --> 02:38:52.793]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[02:38:52.793 --> 02:38:58.756]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything.
[02:39:00.439 --> 02:39:04.342]  has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[02:39:04.342 --> 02:39:05.643]  We've got the best out there.
[02:39:05.643 --> 02:39:10.767]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[02:39:10.767 --> 02:39:17.252]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does and it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[02:39:17.252 --> 02:39:18.993]  This is also cleaned fish oil.
[02:39:18.993 --> 02:39:21.956]  It's been sold out for months but it's back in stock 50% off.
[02:39:21.956 --> 02:39:23.497]  Grill oil is set to sell out.
[02:39:23.497 --> 02:39:24.538]  It's amazing as well.
[02:39:25.118 --> 02:39:30.903]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[02:39:30.903 --> 02:39:34.466]  Ultimate Fish Oil, now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:39:40.491 --> 02:39:41.933]  Most of you thought I was joking.
[02:39:41.933 --> 02:39:44.235]  You've tried it out and most of you have been blown away.

[02:39:53.922 --> 02:39:59.086]  People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year?
[02:39:59.086 --> 02:40:07.132]  Because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year, it's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution.
[02:40:07.132 --> 02:40:10.255]  And not just that, fuel and every other major commodity.
[02:40:10.515 --> 02:40:12.617]  The globalists want a post-industrial world.
[02:40:12.617 --> 02:40:14.419]  They're hitting us with economic war.
[02:40:14.419 --> 02:40:16.000]  I told you food prices would explode.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.121]  They're now exploding.
[02:40:17.121 --> 02:40:20.084]  Our great sponsor, MyPatriot, has barely gone up in price.
[02:40:20.084 --> 02:40:23.867]  Their competitors have gone up even more, but they're about to go up in two weeks.
[02:40:23.867 --> 02:40:30.233]  But instead of just holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening, and then it's got to go up.
[02:40:30.233 --> 02:40:31.995]  10% off at infowarestore.com.
[02:40:32.415 --> 02:40:32.916]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:40:32.916 --> 02:40:34.157]  We're good to go I think?
[02:40:54.236 --> 02:41:06.264]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[02:41:06.264 --> 02:41:13.349]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:20.533]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[02:41:20.533 --> 02:41:22.915]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms
[02:41:23.195 --> 02:41:25.336]  Not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[02:41:25.336 --> 02:41:27.277]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[02:41:27.277 --> 02:41:36.623]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[02:41:36.623 --> 02:41:41.426]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[02:41:41.426 --> 02:41:45.568]  Visit TheBiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[02:41:45.568 --> 02:41:47.209]  That's TheBiopros.com
[02:41:47.569 --> 02:41:51.735]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:57.343]  TheBiopros.com.
[02:41:57.343 --> 02:41:59.947]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:42:13.815 --> 02:42:19.899]  Alright, Alex Jones here, about to hand the baton over to Talk Show host, Stu Peters, StuPeters.TV.
[02:42:19.899 --> 02:42:22.121]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:42:23.076 --> 02:42:25.257]  Ahead of Owen Schroyer, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:42:25.257 --> 02:42:36.782]  with The War Room, and he covers a lot of really important topics, but I saw her latest interview, Dr. Jane Ruby, an interview she did a few days ago with him on this other study.
[02:42:36.782 --> 02:42:39.983]  There's so many of these prestigious studies coming out.
[02:42:39.983 --> 02:42:42.664]  So, Dr. Jane Ruby, I was jumping in a lot there.
[02:42:42.664 --> 02:42:44.205]  What other points do you want to make about this?
[02:42:45.235 --> 02:42:46.296]  How do we warn people?
[02:42:46.296 --> 02:42:47.096]  How do we tell them?
[02:42:47.096 --> 02:42:49.277]  Because, I mean, this is out of control.
[02:42:49.277 --> 02:42:50.638]  This is conclusive.
[02:42:50.638 --> 02:42:56.701]  They knew this, and then I guess the NIH told the vaccine makers, this is how we want it.
[02:42:56.701 --> 02:43:00.303]  We don't want the Chinese what the Indians did, where they just have an attenuated
[02:43:01.315 --> 02:43:02.535]  We're good to go.
[02:43:24.073 --> 02:43:38.070]  Alex, I'm afraid it might be too late by the time people really understand this, but the main point that I wanted to leave people with on that last study that we were starting to talk about is that by the time people start to
[02:43:38.877 --> 02:44:05.462]  React and and have serious injury and die from these bleeding blood clots That it's going to be it's going to be too late And the other thing that we're all worried about is that it's not going to be rightfully attributed to these these experimental injections They're going to start being called, you know general cardiovascular, you know Illnesses and and it's not going to tie back to these injections, but we're going to stay on it and
[02:44:05.982 --> 02:44:15.887]  And we're going to try to keep that information going so that people remember that even though these things are happening all over the body, they are related to these injections.
[02:44:15.887 --> 02:44:19.649]  Well, there's no doubt that they had Operation Lockstep and Event 201.
[02:44:19.649 --> 02:44:20.710]  They pre-planned it all.
[02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:24.432]  They've been caught spiking vaccines with just sterilants before.
[02:44:24.432 --> 02:44:26.253]  They've been caught giving people
[02:44:27.512 --> 02:44:32.993]  Syphilis inside vaccines, and they've been caught giving people polio in the vaccines even last year.
[02:44:32.993 --> 02:44:33.853]  Bill Gates was.
[02:44:33.853 --> 02:44:35.053]  That's Reuters.
[02:44:35.053 --> 02:44:44.035]  The full horror of this, though, that immediately mass heart attacks, immediately mass strokes, immediately people's lungs being eaten into bloody pulps.
[02:44:44.035 --> 02:44:50.136]  This is what they said they saw with COVID, but people that actually caught it, because it's causing your body to attack itself.
[02:44:50.136 --> 02:44:54.117]  Now you make your body create the spike protein to supposedly beat it, and it's far worse.
[02:44:54.617 --> 02:44:56.558]  That's what we're seeing everywhere.
[02:44:56.558 --> 02:45:01.141]  Let's go ahead and bring in Stu Peters, who's going to be hosting next hour.
[02:45:01.141 --> 02:45:04.944]  I know on some other subjects he'll tell us about in a moment, but what is your view on this?
[02:45:04.944 --> 02:45:11.488]  You know, you've been a successful bounty hunter, successful talk show host, you're a family guy, smart guy.
[02:45:11.488 --> 02:45:14.330]  Looking at this, interviewing all the experts, what do you think is going on here?
[02:45:14.330 --> 02:45:16.331]  Because the only thing I see is premeditation.
[02:45:16.331 --> 02:45:18.633]  100%.
[02:45:18.633 --> 02:45:20.454]  Premeditation, they absolutely knew.
[02:45:21.343 --> 02:45:27.909]  And now they're giving you an ultimatum, which is really interesting, which we're going to get into next hour.
[02:45:27.909 --> 02:45:28.930]  Silence or death?
[02:45:29.542 --> 02:45:33.143]  So, in other words, we're going to muzzle you and you're going to have to continue to wear these.
[02:45:33.143 --> 02:45:36.285]  Fauci already indicated that these masks are going to be indefinite.
[02:45:36.285 --> 02:45:39.806]  We know where these masks are manufactured on my program and yours, Alex.
[02:45:39.806 --> 02:45:51.290]  We have shown people where these masks come from, the serious health implications, long-term problems that it can cause, negative health side effects of covering your face constantly.
[02:45:51.290 --> 02:45:58.253]  This is, I mean, and then the symbolic side of it, the Sharia side of it, the muzzling side of it, the distancing from, you know, your peers.
[02:45:59.513 --> 02:46:04.098]  Kids at school doing this while they exert themselves, people working out.
[02:46:04.098 --> 02:46:08.382]  And so Fauci has already said that this is going to be something that he's going to do indefinitely.
[02:46:08.382 --> 02:46:10.003]  You're going to be wearing these masks forever.
[02:46:10.003 --> 02:46:13.106]  And now Biden is saying, or you can go take this injection.
[02:46:13.106 --> 02:46:15.188]  Well, what did we have yesterday?
[02:46:15.188 --> 02:46:15.909]  Or was it this morning?
[02:46:15.909 --> 02:46:16.809]  It just came out.
[02:46:16.809 --> 02:46:23.055]  The Yankees announced eight of their players who are fully injected are now testing positive for COVID-19.
[02:46:23.055 --> 02:46:23.896]  Well, of course they are.
[02:46:24.602 --> 02:46:40.771]  They told us from the beginning that you would have to continue to social distance, continue wearing your mask, stay away from people, because this vaccine that's not a vaccine, which then we started referring to as an experimental injection, but for a lot of reasons today I'm going to stop calling it experimental, because it's not an experiment.
[02:46:40.771 --> 02:46:50.616]  This was absolutely methodically, carefully designed, premeditated, calculated, and that's the one thing that we have to give these globalists credit for, is that they thought about all of this.
[02:46:51.329 --> 02:47:01.338]  So the death sentence is intentionally designed to further that agenda by making these people hypersensitive to any other virus that they might encounter after they inject themselves.
[02:47:01.338 --> 02:47:14.249]  And the scariest part about this thing, Alex, and Dr. Ruby, people are lining up, tripping over themselves, pushing each other, getting in physical altercations to voluntarily subject themselves to this shot in the arm.
[02:47:14.249 --> 02:47:15.430]  They're lining up.
[02:47:15.430 --> 02:47:16.391]  This is so phenomenal.
[02:47:16.391 --> 02:47:17.692]  And people ask, very well said,
[02:47:18.312 --> 02:47:31.156]  If people ask how they get away with it, they've gotten the lawyers, the doctors, the nurses, the media, the system to sign on, and now as the carnage unfolds, 50 times, 100 times worse than autism, everyone will join in on the cover-up now.
[02:47:31.156 --> 02:47:33.077]  I mean, I know people that have had family that dies.
[02:47:33.077 --> 02:47:35.678]  They say, well, it's still worth it, or women are paralyzed.
[02:47:35.678 --> 02:47:36.598]  Well, I'd do it again.
[02:47:36.598 --> 02:47:41.519]  I mean, you talk about Stockholm Syndrome, Stu, and first, Dr. Jane Ruby.
[02:47:41.519 --> 02:47:43.540]  How do we get people out of this Stockholm Syndrome?
[02:47:45.544 --> 02:47:46.725]  Alex, it's really tough.
[02:47:46.725 --> 02:47:49.246]  You know, fear is an incredible motivator.
[02:47:49.246 --> 02:47:51.207]  It's hard to shake people out of their fear.
[02:47:51.207 --> 02:48:03.532]  I mean, people write to me after having had the natural disease of COVID, asking me desperately where they can get ivermectin or HCQ, or if they're in danger of being near someone who hasn't had it.
[02:48:04.212 --> 02:48:06.634]  The misinformation just really abounds.
[02:48:06.634 --> 02:48:16.861]  You know, if your theories are right, if this ensues as well, then what we may have been looking at in the SARS-1 vaccine attempt might have been a test run.
[02:48:16.861 --> 02:48:25.386]  After they knew the animals were going to die and they knew the illnesses and the blood clots and bleeding were going to occur, they went full ahead.
[02:48:25.386 --> 02:48:26.047]  Think about it.
[02:48:26.047 --> 02:48:32.851]  They went full ahead with the SARS-2 program, knowing full well that they at least got that part of their mechanism of action right.
[02:48:34.072 --> 02:48:37.613]  That's exactly what Stu just said that's so key and what you just kept saying.
[02:48:37.613 --> 02:48:39.094]  And that's hiding in plain view.
[02:48:39.094 --> 02:48:41.975]  We keep saying we're all guinea pigs, we're guinea pigs, we don't be guinea pigs.
[02:48:41.975 --> 02:48:42.595]  No!
[02:48:42.595 --> 02:48:50.698]  They did 20 years of study on all these SARS and SPARS and COVIDs and knew that it caused bleed-outs in the animals.
[02:48:50.698 --> 02:48:53.879]  Knew it did this, so that's why they skipped the animal trials.
[02:48:53.879 --> 02:49:00.881]  That's why they went right to emergency authorization to do it out of the open so it could never be nailed down, Stu.
[02:49:02.208 --> 02:49:06.490]  And that's why they don't want you to talk about things like HCQ.
[02:49:06.490 --> 02:49:08.570]  That's why they don't want you to talk about ivermectin.
[02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:12.452]  I got a prescription for ivermectin because I know a doctor.
[02:49:12.452 --> 02:49:13.932]  This doctor prescribed it to me.
[02:49:13.932 --> 02:49:14.813]  You know what it cost me?
[02:49:14.813 --> 02:49:16.993]  It cost me $10.
[02:49:16.993 --> 02:49:20.314]  $10 to get a 90-day supply of ivermectin.
[02:49:20.314 --> 02:49:23.716]  That along with vitamin D. Which you can take preemptively, safely.
[02:49:25.430 --> 02:49:26.431]  That's right.
[02:49:26.431 --> 02:49:29.652]  They don't want you to know about that because of obvious reasons.
[02:49:29.652 --> 02:49:33.654]  I mean, there's billions, trillions of dollars in healthcare.
[02:49:33.654 --> 02:49:36.976]  You want to talk about all of the things that could have been cured.
[02:49:36.976 --> 02:49:38.757]  There's a reason why we don't cure cancer.
[02:49:38.757 --> 02:49:43.019]  There's way too much money and power and control and manipulation leverage
[02:49:43.579 --> 02:49:47.860]  In continuing to allow these cancers to create fear.
[02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:51.141]  Fear drives compliance, compliance creates control.
[02:49:51.141 --> 02:50:02.143]  That is what all of this is, is a force of complete subservience to the state and they are winning because they're winning right now the information war which is why we have to continue to push back.
[02:50:02.143 --> 02:50:06.444]  The question that you asked Dr. Ruby is the trillion dollar question.
[02:50:06.444 --> 02:50:08.224]  How do we make people aware of this
[02:50:09.125 --> 02:50:13.809]  In a situation, in an environment, where we are being constantly shadow banned.
[02:50:13.809 --> 02:50:16.871]  I was telling somebody earlier today, I got a text from Jan Morgan.
[02:50:16.871 --> 02:50:18.212]  She's running for Senate in Arkansas.
[02:50:18.212 --> 02:50:19.333]  She's America First Patriot.
[02:50:19.333 --> 02:50:21.414]  She texted me at 1240 this morning.
[02:50:21.414 --> 02:50:23.075]  I didn't even know you were still doing your show.
[02:50:23.075 --> 02:50:24.496]  You're never in my feed.
[02:50:24.496 --> 02:50:25.917]  You are completely shadow banned.
[02:50:25.917 --> 02:50:27.258]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:50:27.258 --> 02:50:27.799]  That's right.
[02:50:27.799 --> 02:50:29.200]  You can't count on
[02:50:29.921 --> 02:50:30.821]  Thank you, Stu.
[02:50:59.696 --> 02:51:00.278]  Thank you.
[02:51:00.278 --> 02:51:02.022]  Really appreciate the opportunity to be here.
[02:51:02.022 --> 02:51:03.144]  Brother, I appreciate you.
[02:51:03.144 --> 02:51:04.046]  You're kicking ass.
[02:51:04.046 --> 02:51:05.971]  I can't wait while I'm eating lunch, somebody watching and listening.
[02:51:05.971 --> 02:51:09.760]  Now, Dr. Ruby, in closing, what else do you want to impart to folks with a minute left?
[02:51:11.491 --> 02:51:21.879]  Well, there's also, these researchers also found out that the spike proteins actually damage structures inside every one of your cells.
[02:51:21.879 --> 02:51:25.502]  For those of you who remember high school biology, there's the mitochondria.
[02:51:25.502 --> 02:51:30.306]  We all used to know it as, the late term is the little powerhouse of the cell.
[02:51:30.306 --> 02:51:34.089]  But the mitochondria are incredibly involved in your immunity.
[02:51:34.729 --> 02:51:34.950]  Thank you.
[02:51:57.606 --> 02:52:00.788]  Yes, and to damage your body over time.
[02:52:00.788 --> 02:52:10.712]  And when you start to have multiple different variable illnesses, we just worry that people are not going to make the connection to the injections.
[02:52:10.712 --> 02:52:16.055]  But just like vitamins and minerals help with other viruses, we don't have any evidence.
[02:52:16.055 --> 02:52:20.537]  We don't know yet whether that would help with the spike protein or if we're getting it from shedding.
[02:52:20.537 --> 02:52:22.477]  I mean, I know Pfizer admits the shedding is real.
[02:52:22.477 --> 02:52:24.438]  Well, Dr. Ruby, thank you so much.
[02:52:24.438 --> 02:52:25.759]  Look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
[02:52:26.937 --> 02:52:27.497]  My pleasure.
[02:52:27.497 --> 02:52:28.658]  Thank you.
[02:52:28.658 --> 02:52:29.158]  All right, folks.
[02:52:29.158 --> 02:52:30.399]  I'm going to come back and do five minutes.
[02:52:30.399 --> 02:52:32.440]  Some stations don't carry that five minutes, but some stations do.
[02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:38.963]  So I'm going to finish up and I'm going to hand the baton to the next guest host, Stu Peters, and I'm going to hit a few final news pieces.
[02:52:38.963 --> 02:52:40.684]  We'll be back in two minutes, then he takes over.
[02:52:43.090 --> 02:52:57.914]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia, with no evidence, for the shutdown of the East Coast gasoline pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast.
[02:52:57.914 --> 02:53:07.456]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and sent to the East Coast?
[02:53:07.456 --> 02:53:12.417]  That's right, Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed.
[02:53:12.897 --> 02:53:15.079]  Joe Biden did that to America.
[02:53:15.079 --> 02:53:16.179]  He has the history.
[02:53:16.179 --> 02:53:17.300]  He has the background.
[02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:20.562]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[02:53:20.562 --> 02:53:24.685]  He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[02:53:24.685 --> 02:53:28.988]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world.
[02:53:28.988 --> 02:53:34.552]  And they want the United States, Europe, and Australia crippled so Communist China can be dominant.
[02:53:34.552 --> 02:53:36.113]  It's not Russia that's the enemy.
[02:53:36.113 --> 02:53:40.676]  It's Communist China and their millions, like Joe Biden, in control of the White House.
[02:53:40.676 --> 02:53:41.556]  That's the facts.
[02:53:41.556 --> 02:53:42.437]  That's the information.
[02:53:44.017 --> 02:53:47.859]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[02:53:47.859 --> 02:53:52.180]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[02:53:52.180 --> 02:54:01.063]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:01.063 --> 02:54:10.586]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate
[02:54:10.606 --> 02:54:10.786]  I'm good.
[02:54:29.193 --> 02:54:37.679]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[02:54:37.679 --> 02:54:46.866]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:54:46.866 --> 02:54:53.431]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:53.431 --> 02:54:56.513]  Well, you were sleeping.
[02:55:01.234 --> 02:55:08.078]  All right, folks, we're into the fourth hour.
[02:55:08.078 --> 02:55:16.443]  In five minutes, I will step down from this broadcasting seat and hand it over to Stu Peters.
[02:55:16.443 --> 02:55:24.968]  For myself, I have a $64 trillion question, and I know that this is the question you have as well, because I heard callers asking it earlier, and it's what I was already thinking.
[02:55:25.675 --> 02:55:49.304]  We know that from regular viruses, whether they're flu viruses, cold viruses, corona, any of it, that they can't replicate if you have, it's almost impossible, if you have enough vitamins and minerals of all the essential types, that means magnesium, that means zinc, that means C, that means D, vitamin K, that they can't replicate in your cells, and that that then protects the mitochondria.
[02:55:49.304 --> 02:55:52.485]  But if it's just a straight-up spike that's like a bullet, a weapon,
[02:55:53.849 --> 02:55:58.954]  And then your body also attacks that and causes an autoimmune response.
[02:55:58.954 --> 02:56:01.296]  I don't know what you do.
[02:56:01.296 --> 02:56:03.718]  And obviously Pfizer and others admit the shedding.
[02:56:03.718 --> 02:56:05.039]  It's in their own literature.
[02:56:05.039 --> 02:56:10.404]  They have Snopes saying it's not true because it's in the damn Pfizer admissions.
[02:56:10.404 --> 02:56:12.366]  We don't know if pregnant women should have this.
[02:56:12.366 --> 02:56:17.771]  We don't know if a woman breastfeeding should have it and whether it'll shed or infect the child.
[02:56:17.771 --> 02:56:19.713]  And now they're admitting it's happening.
[02:56:20.777 --> 02:56:33.449]  And even NPR and USA Today had scientists going, you know, six months ago, we're worried the vaccine will cause new strains and make the body create new viruses, which it can do.
[02:56:33.449 --> 02:56:36.392]  They're way more advanced than they told the general public.
[02:56:36.392 --> 02:56:38.694]  They've been really obsessed with this for a while.
[02:56:38.694 --> 02:56:41.377]  And this is the soft kill weapon.
[02:56:41.377 --> 02:56:43.659]  And it just attacks different people, different ways.
[02:56:43.659 --> 02:56:44.820]  Some people are going to live 20 years.
[02:56:44.820 --> 02:56:45.821]  Some are going to live six months.
[02:56:46.668 --> 02:56:50.012]  Uh, and it's pretty clear it's shedding.
[02:56:50.012 --> 02:56:55.678]  And so you've got a lot of camps for Jews and Christians saying, we don't want people that have had the vaccine around our kids.
[02:56:55.678 --> 02:56:56.379]  It's not a vaccine.
[02:56:56.379 --> 02:57:00.644]  It turns your body into an engine of, you know, biological pollution.
[02:57:00.644 --> 02:57:04.889]  You got the left trying to intimidate us to take it because they're married to Satan in the state.
[02:57:05.949 --> 02:57:13.772]  You've got all these different schools and different whole food type places that aren't whole foods, but other grocery stores saying, don't come in if you're vaccinated.
[02:57:13.772 --> 02:57:14.933]  And you know, that's not bullying.
[02:57:14.933 --> 02:57:19.815]  That's pushback because they're the ones trying to tell us we won't have a life until we submit to them.
[02:57:19.815 --> 02:57:20.855]  How about things we own?
[02:57:20.855 --> 02:57:23.236]  We just say you're not welcome.
[02:57:23.236 --> 02:57:26.817]  So they start thinking about what's happening because the left runs on peer pressure.
[02:57:26.817 --> 02:57:28.298]  They're followers.
[02:57:28.298 --> 02:57:29.639]  They run on the left hand path.
[02:57:29.639 --> 02:57:30.639]  They're basically Satanists.
[02:57:31.363 --> 02:57:35.105]  Or they're useful idiots that buy into, I'm the good guy, the TV said so.
[02:57:35.105 --> 02:57:40.488]  They're useful idiots and satanists that want to be powerful and satanists that are in power.
[02:57:40.488 --> 02:57:43.049]  And that's really what it comes down to and it's extremely serious.
[02:57:43.049 --> 02:57:47.692]  So, you've got my commitment that I'm going to reach out to a bunch of scientists
[02:57:48.288 --> 02:57:50.308]  And a bunch of medical doctors.
[02:57:50.308 --> 02:57:53.709]  And we're going to really twist Sherry Tinpinney's arm, too, to get back on.
[02:57:53.709 --> 02:57:55.450]  So I really respect her.
[02:57:55.450 --> 02:58:06.752]  But I know a lot of other epidemiologists and scientists, people need to contact Wolfgang Wudarg, Dr. Yidan, all of them, and say, is there any counter to once it's replicating to get it out of you?
[02:58:06.752 --> 02:58:10.553]  Or if you're around people to protect yourself, or at least mitigate it?
[02:58:10.553 --> 02:58:10.733]  I mean,
[02:58:12.159 --> 02:58:13.761]  That's where we are.
[02:58:13.761 --> 02:58:17.505]  They try to keep you from knowing about vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[02:58:17.505 --> 02:58:19.047]  They're just as essential as oxygen or water.
[02:58:19.047 --> 02:58:20.949]  It just takes longer to die if you don't have them.
[02:58:22.138 --> 02:58:24.139]  And that's like a hundred percent, folks.
[02:58:24.139 --> 02:58:28.480]  The problem is some people get so old, their guts are messed up, you can't absorb it, then there's that issue.
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:33.341]  But the cardiovascular is so clogged up, your body can't get the nutrients in the cells.
[02:58:33.341 --> 02:58:37.042]  But if you've got good cardiovascular and stuff, or decent, vitamins and minerals, you're bulletproof.
[02:58:37.042 --> 02:58:39.323]  But not with all of this, from what I know.
[02:58:39.323 --> 02:58:40.663]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:58:40.663 --> 02:58:42.504]  I hope vitamins and minerals are the answer.
[02:58:42.504 --> 02:58:48.946]  But as the Lord knows, I've been taking a lot more of them, and I feel more energy and a lot better.
[02:58:48.946 --> 02:58:50.426]  By the way, with inflation coming up,
[02:58:51.471 --> 02:58:52.571]  All the craziness.
[02:58:52.571 --> 02:58:57.873]  We have locked in last year's prices of 10% lower in 2021.
[02:58:57.873 --> 02:59:03.074]  The prices are going up everywhere in commodities and food to the highest levels ever recorded in the futures cost.
[02:59:03.074 --> 02:59:11.716]  And even current numbers are record increases 6.8 or whatever it was for just last month versus the previous record of 5.8 I think it was.
[02:59:11.716 --> 02:59:14.137]  But I covered that with the documents yesterday.
[02:59:14.137 --> 02:59:15.217]  You need to get storable food.
[02:59:15.217 --> 02:59:16.278]  We've got it ready to ship you.
[02:59:16.278 --> 02:59:16.998]  It's high quality.
[02:59:17.600 --> 02:59:19.002]  They're going to have to go up on Monday.
[02:59:19.002 --> 02:59:20.604]  I twisted their arm again for a few more days.
[02:59:20.604 --> 02:59:23.928]  A lot of folks wanted to get paid on Friday, so they could get the affordable food order.
[02:59:23.928 --> 02:59:32.119]  It's a very smart thing to be able to eat insurance, and to be able to lock in your dollar value now, and then have this last 20-something years if you need it.
[02:59:32.119 --> 02:59:33.080]  But I think you'll be eating it a lot.
[02:59:33.380 --> 02:59:33.981]  Quicker than that.
[02:59:33.981 --> 02:59:34.481]  It's high quality.
[02:59:34.481 --> 02:59:35.823]  It's what I use for my family.
[02:59:35.823 --> 02:59:37.445]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[02:59:37.445 --> 02:59:40.588]  PrepareWithAlex.com or 888-253-3139 to call.
[02:59:40.588 --> 02:59:43.211]  We can answer all your questions.
[02:59:43.211 --> 02:59:44.112]  Take your orders.
[02:59:44.112 --> 02:59:44.813]  Get your order in.
[02:59:44.813 --> 02:59:47.476]  It'll be shipping out by Monday to you and your family.
[02:59:47.476 --> 02:59:48.117]  I would not wait.
[02:59:48.117 --> 02:59:49.158]  I'd get prepared now.
[02:59:49.158 --> 02:59:50.139]  The Globals want you dependent.
[02:59:52.739 --> 02:59:58.820]  Two weeks ago, I launched a sale on all the high-quality, storable foods at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[02:59:58.820 --> 03:00:09.742]  And I pointed out that the Bloomberg Global Food Index shows that current crop purchases being made for the end of the summer, when the crops are completed, around the world, is up 76%.
[03:00:09.742 --> 03:00:12.662]  That alone will cause civil unrest and major problems.
[03:00:12.662 --> 03:00:15.423]  Since then, inflation has exploded in the last two weeks.
[03:00:15.423 --> 03:00:17.003]  You've seen the pipeline crises.
[03:00:17.003 --> 03:00:20.404]  You've seen Governor Whitmer shutting down or trying to shut down the pipeline in Michigan.
[03:00:20.404 --> 03:00:21.664]  This is a concerted operation.
[03:00:21.864 --> 03:00:24.545]  And so, Lister's had a huge response to our big sale.
[03:00:24.545 --> 03:00:28.226]  2020 prices in the year 2021.
[03:00:28.226 --> 03:00:29.647]  10% off all storable foods.
[03:00:29.647 --> 03:00:30.787]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[03:00:30.787 --> 03:00:37.229]  Now, the sale ended yesterday, so I'm now, because of a lot of requests, extending it through Sunday, and that it absolutely has to end.
[03:00:37.229 --> 03:00:43.031]  So, one month, three months, six months, your supplies, highest quality water filters, and so much more.
[03:00:43.031 --> 03:00:44.371]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[03:00:44.371 --> 03:00:48.552]  It's the best store you're going to find on high quality storable food for you and your family and your community.
[03:00:48.552 --> 03:00:50.113]  Get ready now at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[03:01:05.089 --> 03:01:14.719]  Been talking about how intentional this is, the ultimatum that was given by Joe Biden, making it clear to all Americans that you'll obey or that you'll be silenced.
[03:01:14.719 --> 03:01:26.571]  And the death sentence is intentionally designed, in my opinion, to further the globalist agenda for the depopulation that we keep talking about, the control, the compliance for the power.
[03:01:26.571 --> 03:01:27.892]  None of this is by accident.
[03:01:29.284 --> 03:01:55.861]  It's a very well thought out, carefully manufactured, methodically implemented plan that includes, as Alex was alluding to before the break, it includes every asset at the disposal of the government, including the influence that these elitists hold using money as leverage to coerce corporate America, professional sports, Hollywood, big tech, print media, major broadcast networks.
[03:01:57.125 --> 03:02:05.648]  Cable news outlets into constantly feeding the masses with really well-written, very appropriately constructed propaganda.
[03:02:05.648 --> 03:02:16.311]  It's impossible to go anywhere without seeing signs encouraging or requiring, masking constant reminders about how inconvenient life will be.
[03:02:16.311 --> 03:02:24.894]  Should you continue to resist what we used to refer to as an experimental injection, no longer do I believe it's an experiment.
[03:02:24.894 --> 03:02:26.054]  It's also part of the plan.
[03:02:27.105 --> 03:02:34.933]  The doubt that you and I have about the so-called vaccine, that was anticipated.
[03:02:34.933 --> 03:02:41.839]  And countermeasures have been put into place to combat any resistance that we might bring forth.
[03:02:41.839 --> 03:02:46.724]  These people are evil, but they are well organized.
[03:02:46.724 --> 03:02:49.487]  They're the devil in human form, but they're intelligent.
[03:02:50.229 --> 03:03:10.358]  Well-connected, deep-rooted, powerful people who have been able to manipulate the world into believing that the United States government is actually acting in the best interest of its people, but has systematically been working to destroy us for decades.
[03:03:10.358 --> 03:03:15.380]  People like George Soros have been able to infiltrate every level of government.
[03:03:17.034 --> 03:03:19.576]  They've influenced the criminal justice system.
[03:03:19.576 --> 03:03:23.838]  They've politicized command staffs at law enforcement agencies.
[03:03:23.838 --> 03:03:44.871]  They've funded the campaigns of radical progressive DAs and other candidates, ensuring that no opposition could stand in the way of a total takeover and the successful toppling of a political system that has governed and operated this republic for centuries.
[03:03:44.871 --> 03:03:46.592]  You guys, the state is so deep.
[03:03:48.416 --> 03:04:15.869]  The depths of the swamp that Donald J. Trump promised to drain was so carefully silenced under this cone of silence that these authoritarians operate inside of, influencing circuit, district, appellate, Supreme Courts at the state and federal levels, corrupting the judiciary so greatly that the entire system will always operate
[03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:20.752]  In the best interest of the elite.
[03:04:20.752 --> 03:04:25.775]  The amount of time that it's taken to pull the curtains back and catch just a glimpse.
[03:04:26.596 --> 03:04:42.979]  Of what's really going on is only a fraction as compared to the centuries that it would take to expose every single player in the game that's responsible for this hostile takeover and destruction of liberty, which is why we get so frustrated wondering why is Hillary Clinton still walking around?
[03:04:42.979 --> 03:04:44.680]  Why have there been no military tribunals?
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:51.381]  Why is it okay for Obama to spy on Trump as a campaigning person and even into his presidency?
[03:04:53.058 --> 03:04:56.841]  They're looking for the total destruction and frustration of our liberty.
[03:04:56.841 --> 03:05:05.948]  Freedom is only an illusion at this point and there isn't a baby born today that will ever truly know what it means to be a free being.
[03:05:05.948 --> 03:05:08.950]  Imagine that.
[03:05:08.950 --> 03:05:17.997]  The top paid bureaucrat in the United States government is not a person elected by we the people.
[03:05:19.955 --> 03:05:44.350]  He's not somebody that was sent as a representative of our will, but instead an installed personification of Satan himself, with unilateral authority to implement regulatory policy, to completely transform infrastructure, our educational system, to collapse small business,
[03:05:45.859 --> 03:06:02.932]  To restrict the movement of healthy people, to terminate constitutional rights, right in front of us, in the name of a virus that he funded, that was intentionally released, and that he continues to lie about every single day.
[03:06:02.932 --> 03:06:06.836]  Anthony Fauci is a criminal.
[03:06:06.836 --> 03:06:12.320]  And this guy, along with the help of the state, that claims to operate in your best interest,
[03:06:13.573 --> 03:06:19.855]  Has been able to do all of it behind the cloak of a virus with a recovery rate of nearly 100%.
[03:06:19.855 --> 03:06:20.715]  Let that sink in.
[03:06:20.715 --> 03:06:30.118]  So now you have to ask yourself, what's it going to look like when something really deadly impacts the globe?
[03:06:30.118 --> 03:06:33.459]  Something with real teeth.
[03:06:33.459 --> 03:06:36.260]  Some real effective bioweapon.
[03:06:36.260 --> 03:06:39.061]  Something designed to mutilate.
[03:06:39.061 --> 03:06:41.182]  To spread like wildfire and kill.
[03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:48.131]  Something carefully fashioned for complete destruction.
[03:06:48.131 --> 03:07:00.874]  Something the masses will voluntarily run toward, physically fight for, and push to the front of the line, begging to be injected with.
[03:07:00.874 --> 03:07:11.976]  As we watch our favorite actors, Hall of Fame players, political icons, people of influence and stature, these people will advocate for your demise because they don't know any better.
[03:07:14.841 --> 03:07:29.225]  A former president with a grassroots following will tout this lethal concoction and will probably take credit for its distribution because he's guarded by gatekeepers.
[03:07:29.225 --> 03:07:35.907]  And he will never realize, until it's too late, the amount of blood that will soak his hands.
[03:07:35.907 --> 03:07:41.248]  At which point, I believe the plan will be that he will be targeted by the state,
[03:07:42.577 --> 03:07:53.382]  He'll be taken into custody and he'll be tried before the military in front of the entire world to take a fall that's been designed in secret for many years.
[03:07:53.382 --> 03:07:55.804]  None of it is coincidence.
[03:07:55.804 --> 03:07:59.806]  Nothing is by accident.
[03:07:59.806 --> 03:08:12.272]  These masks trap germs and viruses, blowing up the number of positive PCR tests, which we have been told by its inventor are completely unreliable.
[03:08:13.934 --> 03:08:17.657]  He called Anthony Fauci a liar and a fraud decades ago, but nobody noticed.
[03:08:17.657 --> 03:08:19.238]  Nobody listened.
[03:08:19.238 --> 03:08:34.690]  The explosion of these positive tests just magically leads now to the disappearance of influenza, deadly heart conditions, diabetic ketoacidosis, strokes, and all these other causes of death.
[03:08:34.690 --> 03:08:37.712]  It's a miracle!
[03:08:37.712 --> 03:08:42.616]  But meanwhile, the injection ultimatum cannot be disregarded as stupid or unplanned.
[03:08:43.630 --> 03:08:48.192]  It's not a geriatric moment by the installed fake president.
[03:08:48.192 --> 03:08:50.693]  It's on purpose.
[03:08:50.693 --> 03:09:11.281]  If Dr. Ruby is right, and if this study is right, and if America's Frontline doctors are right, and if Dr. Carrie Madej is right, and if Dr. Tenpenny is right, and if Dr. McCullough and so many more, the list goes on and on, the injection is going to make the injected person more susceptible to damage,
[03:09:12.503 --> 03:09:23.966]  Imminent great bodily harm or death when they come into contact with any other virus, any other coronavirus, any other kind of sickness, major damage to their organs, catastrophic failure causing death.
[03:09:23.966 --> 03:09:29.107]  They've been primed for death.
[03:09:29.107 --> 03:09:33.228]  Of course it's okay for you to take your mask off.
[03:09:33.228 --> 03:09:36.128]  It's part of the plan.
[03:09:36.128 --> 03:09:38.949]  This isn't some big new shocking announcement or revelation.
[03:09:40.862 --> 03:09:41.482]  Behave!
[03:09:41.482 --> 03:09:41.842]  Obey!
[03:09:41.842 --> 03:09:43.263]  You might get your 4th of July!
[03:09:43.263 --> 03:09:47.644]  They were priming us for all of this!
[03:09:47.644 --> 03:09:55.707]  Of course it's okay for you to take your mask off, inside and out, after being fully vaccinated.
[03:09:55.707 --> 03:09:57.128]  You gotta get a hold of your neighbors.
[03:09:57.128 --> 03:09:58.989]  You gotta get a hold of your church congregation.
[03:09:58.989 --> 03:10:00.969]  You gotta get a hold of your friends.
[03:10:00.969 --> 03:10:02.470]  I had Dr. Ruby hold on.
[03:10:02.470 --> 03:10:04.811]  I want to have her here, holding her over.
[03:10:04.811 --> 03:10:08.472]  We're going to have her back for another segment because I have some pretty specific questions for her.
[03:10:09.648 --> 03:10:10.548]  This is a big deal.
[03:10:10.548 --> 03:10:23.575]  I mean, I'm not a medical expert, which is why we reach out to them, but you have to stay informed, and you have to make sure that you grab a hold of somebody and tell them, this is not the experiment you think it is.
[03:10:23.575 --> 03:10:28.597]  You didn't research this, because if you take this thing, you are the research.
[03:10:28.597 --> 03:10:37.021]  You're the laboratory animal that they skipped over when they rushed this thing through emergency use to the market, knowing exactly what it was going to do to the masses.
[03:10:38.104 --> 03:10:42.649]  We'll get Dr. Ruby to come back and weigh in on all of that as we continue on Bandness.TV.
[03:10:42.649 --> 03:10:45.152]  My name is Stu Peters, in for Alex Jones.
[03:10:45.152 --> 03:10:46.594]  Find me at StuPeters.TV.
[03:10:46.594 --> 03:10:47.094]  We'll be right back.
[03:10:51.104 --> 03:10:57.446]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?
[03:10:57.446 --> 03:11:00.407]  You can with Great Wall of Fire Fireplace Grates.

[03:11:21.425 --> 03:11:22.225]  Hey, everybody.
[03:11:22.225 --> 03:11:25.447]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[03:11:25.447 --> 03:11:26.227]  Me too.
[03:11:26.227 --> 03:11:33.331]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[03:11:33.331 --> 03:11:37.713]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[03:11:37.713 --> 03:11:39.614]  You probably already believe that.
[03:11:39.614 --> 03:11:40.634]  I certainly do.
[03:11:40.634 --> 03:11:41.575]  So here's the thing.
[03:11:41.575 --> 03:11:49.899]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[03:11:50.459 --> 03:11:55.885]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[03:12:21.272 --> 03:12:22.512]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:12:22.512 --> 03:12:26.413]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:12:26.413 --> 03:12:27.953]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:12:27.953 --> 03:12:30.914]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:12:30.914 --> 03:12:36.475]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:12:36.475 --> 03:12:37.675]  I can help you too.
[03:12:37.675 --> 03:12:40.616]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:12:40.616 --> 03:12:42.836]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:12:42.836 --> 03:12:47.277]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:12:47.277 --> 03:12:49.618]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:12:51.855 --> 03:12:55.339]  Fourteen months ago, I began to sit on the broadcast every day.
[03:12:55.339 --> 03:12:58.502]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[03:12:58.502 --> 03:13:10.394]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts, that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[03:13:10.394 --> 03:13:13.397]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[03:13:13.977 --> 03:13:20.643]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[03:13:20.643 --> 03:13:23.786]  Plus the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down along with other pipelines.
[03:13:23.786 --> 03:13:27.269]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[03:13:27.269 --> 03:13:28.150]  We're being shut down.
[03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:30.472]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[03:13:30.472 --> 03:13:32.894]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[03:13:33.414 --> 03:13:35.775]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the Globalist?
[03:13:35.775 --> 03:13:38.276]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[03:13:38.276 --> 03:13:40.337]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[03:13:40.337 --> 03:13:41.457]  And that's my allegory.
[03:14:03.934 --> 03:14:14.997]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[03:14:14.997 --> 03:14:17.317]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about 8 hours.
[03:14:17.317 --> 03:14:23.059]  But people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[03:14:23.059 --> 03:14:29.280]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[03:14:29.280 --> 03:14:30.700]  It's a total solution.
[03:14:30.700 --> 03:14:31.981]  All around the best you're going to find.
[03:14:31.981 --> 03:14:32.821]  TurboForce.
[03:14:33.541 --> 03:14:35.241]  With you, we don't roll.
[03:14:35.241 --> 03:14:36.942]  With you, we surge forward together.
[03:14:36.942 --> 03:14:38.982]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[03:14:38.982 --> 03:14:41.603]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[03:14:41.603 --> 03:14:44.664]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[03:14:44.664 --> 03:14:46.084]  It's a win-win.
[03:14:46.084 --> 03:14:47.124]  360 together.
[03:14:47.124 --> 03:14:47.965]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:14:47.965 --> 03:14:49.205]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:12.449 --> 03:15:16.591]  Of course it's okay to take your mask off inside and out after being fully vaccinated.
[03:15:16.591 --> 03:15:26.335]  Now, OSHA, really big news for us, is saying if you require your employees to be vaccinated as a condition of employment, i.e.
[03:15:26.335 --> 03:15:34.799]  for work-related reasons, then any adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine will be work-related.
[03:15:34.799 --> 03:15:38.281]  That's a tremendous first step by OSHA
[03:15:39.443 --> 03:15:41.544]  Because we know about these adverse reactions.
[03:15:41.544 --> 03:15:42.684]  We talked about VAERS data.
[03:15:42.684 --> 03:15:44.885]  We broke that story on my show.
[03:15:44.885 --> 03:16:04.172]  Conveniently, after I started talking about specific VAERS occurrences, 5-month-old baby, 15-year-old kid, 16, 17-year-old kids, conveniently, the day that I brought attention to that on my platform, the search function for the VAERS website went completely dark.
[03:16:04.172 --> 03:16:04.772]  It went down.
[03:16:04.772 --> 03:16:05.492]  It was disabled.
[03:16:05.492 --> 03:16:07.013]  You could not get in there.
[03:16:07.013 --> 03:16:08.193]  The site could not be found.
[03:16:08.988 --> 03:16:13.050]  And then, later that evening, Tucker started talking about it on his program.
[03:16:13.050 --> 03:16:16.632]  He kind of scratched the surface of this VAERS stuff.
[03:16:16.632 --> 03:16:25.936]  And then, when you go back now that it's up, and you look for the specific VAERS cases that I highlighted on the show, they are now gone.
[03:16:25.936 --> 03:16:31.939]  So, they continue to manipulate, move around the information as we find it, but it's there if you dig for it.
[03:16:31.939 --> 03:16:33.460]  I can't do all the research for you.
[03:16:34.815 --> 03:16:36.196]  You know, Alex does a good job.
[03:16:36.196 --> 03:16:41.957]  His team, they can't do all the... Dr. Tenpenny, Dr. Ruby, they can't do all of the research for you.
[03:16:41.957 --> 03:16:50.961]  We're doing it and bringing it to you, but you have to go and get into the URLs, get into the web, talk to people who have had real experiences.
[03:16:50.961 --> 03:16:58.483]  While we were in break right there, I received an email from a listener whose sister has had now an adverse reaction to the vaccine.
[03:16:58.483 --> 03:16:59.704]  She wants to know if it's a coincidence.
[03:16:59.704 --> 03:17:02.164]  Well, I'm not the medical expert, but we do have the medical expert here.
[03:17:02.164 --> 03:17:03.605]  Dr. Ruby is nice enough
[03:17:04.105 --> 03:17:06.446]  to stay with us and hold over.
[03:17:06.446 --> 03:17:12.469]  So these people have been primed for death, which is basically what Dr. Ruby alluded to when she was on my show last.
[03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:13.210]  She's here again.
[03:17:13.210 --> 03:17:19.333]  Dr. Ruby, OSHA has announced that any employees that you require to be vaccinated
[03:17:20.033 --> 03:17:24.735]  Uh, who have an adverse reaction, that adverse reaction would then become work-related.
[03:17:24.735 --> 03:17:28.236]  So, in other words, these employers could potentially be held accountable.
[03:17:28.236 --> 03:17:46.224]  My concern is, whoever OSHA's counterpart is, uh, in the educational sphere, uh, for, for these colleges, for these kids that are going back, that are being required, these young adults are being required to take this injection, to take the jab, to get the shot in the arm before they're allowed to return to in-person classes on their campus.
[03:17:46.964 --> 03:17:58.914]  This is going to be absolutely catastrophic if the study that you brought to our attention that we broke to the world the other day is accurate, which I don't see any way to really dispute the evidence.
[03:17:58.914 --> 03:18:04.278]  I mean, we saw the spike proteins, we saw the graph, we saw the study that you brought.
[03:18:04.278 --> 03:18:06.040]  What's going to happen to our young adults?
[03:18:09.091 --> 03:18:11.213]  Sue, this is why we're trying to get the word out.
[03:18:11.213 --> 03:18:24.748]  First of all, the OSHA decision is actually good news because it puts the onus of responsibility and accountability for injury from these injections back onto the entity that's demanding it.
[03:18:25.428 --> 03:18:42.599]  And as you mentioned, if we could get that same expectation for colleges and universities that are demanding it, or any entity, if we shift that burden, you'll see how fast those demands and those requirements are changing.
[03:18:42.599 --> 03:18:44.840]  Some employers are now realizing
[03:18:45.300 --> 03:18:55.746]  That if they're responsible, then they're going to have to pay directly because the companies that they contract with for group insurance are already backing away.
[03:18:55.746 --> 03:19:01.349]  And they are saying, we're not covering that for your group employees.
[03:19:01.349 --> 03:19:09.513]  So that means it's going to fall back onto the corporation that's demanding that their employees, as a condition of either new employment or continued employment,
[03:19:10.153 --> 03:19:24.143]  Yeah, but what I posted on Twitter the other day was that in response large contractors have now said that they have changed or will change their vaccination policy to only recommend and not require.
[03:19:24.143 --> 03:19:29.106]  So my question was, and I recognize this is a very good thing, but my question was
[03:19:29.875 --> 03:19:38.877]  For these colleges, for these universities, the deans, the people that oversee the faculty there, who is the organizing body, like the OSHA of the work environment?
[03:19:38.877 --> 03:19:39.978]  Who's the organizing body?
[03:19:39.978 --> 03:19:40.578]  But what do you do?
[03:19:40.578 --> 03:19:45.839]  You go to the government, the people that are perpetuating this, the people that are pushing this onto us?
[03:19:45.839 --> 03:19:46.239]  What do you do?
[03:19:46.239 --> 03:19:47.640]  Go to the Department of Education?
[03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:55.844]  These are the people that are advocating for these students to do it, making it impossible for them to go unvaccinated and return to class.
[03:19:55.844 --> 03:20:06.929]  So they're essentially telling them, you will never be successful at completing your degree, completing your education, all of your childhood dreams to become whatever it was that you wanted to become, that you have now gone to study for.
[03:20:06.929 --> 03:20:08.250]  You will not realize that.
[03:20:08.731 --> 03:20:18.873]  You'll never get that success unless you roll the dice and take this shot in the arm that we are now seeing has been intentionally designed and released to cause catastrophic health conditions including death.
[03:20:20.416 --> 03:20:37.028]  Well, the difference between the employers and the OSHA decision and the colleges demanding vaccine or injection prior to coming back to school is that, you know, in the first case, that's your employment.
[03:20:37.028 --> 03:20:43.933]  And so there is a way to put that back, that accountability back on the employer.
[03:20:43.933 --> 03:20:47.496]  In the case of colleges and universities, I want to point out to parents
[03:20:48.016 --> 03:20:49.436]  And students alike.
[03:20:49.436 --> 03:20:53.477]  You have a choice of where you go to college or university.
[03:20:53.477 --> 03:21:02.219]  And so, yes, I understand that you might already be admitted, you might already be on your way to, you know, completing your degree, and you've invested a lot in it.
[03:21:02.219 --> 03:21:11.742]  But it's either your life or your college degree, most conveniently, you know, shortest route through this particular university.
[03:21:11.742 --> 03:21:13.242]  We have a lot more power than we think.
[03:21:13.242 --> 03:21:16.583]  And we're talking about lifelong events as well, not just your degree.
[03:21:17.378 --> 03:21:19.301]  I mean, yeah, you said this is your life.
[03:21:19.301 --> 03:21:24.348]  But if you do survive... Infertility... Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[03:21:24.348 --> 03:21:25.169]  There's a little delay here.
[03:21:25.169 --> 03:21:26.091]  I'm not trying to interrupt you.
[03:21:26.613 --> 03:21:27.394]  Yeah, so sorry.
[03:21:27.394 --> 03:21:28.936]  I know, sometimes there is.
[03:21:28.936 --> 03:21:36.804]  What I'm saying is that parents and their children, their teens or their college-age children, are consumers.
[03:21:36.804 --> 03:21:40.528]  It's a little bit different in the employment setting, so I'm happy to see that.
[03:21:40.528 --> 03:21:49.177]  I would like to see the same responsibility shifted to any entity that demands in a bilateral relationship, business relationship.
[03:21:49.858 --> 03:21:53.823]  Like colleges and universities, that they take the accountability.
[03:21:53.823 --> 03:21:58.408]  But I want parents and students to remember, you have choice.
[03:21:58.408 --> 03:22:07.200]  And there are, just like there are shops and businesses and gyms and salons that do not require vaccination, injection, whatever you want to call it.
[03:22:07.660 --> 03:22:08.181]  Thank you so much.
[03:22:21.832 --> 03:22:26.755]  Yeah, we're seeing now, I got an email from a listener of the Stu Peter Show today.
[03:22:26.755 --> 03:22:29.017]  I'm looking at it right now.
[03:22:29.017 --> 03:22:31.599]  Delta Airlines has now sent out an email.
[03:22:31.599 --> 03:22:37.503]  We learned this morning that their policy is going to be that for all new hires, they will be required to be vaccinated.
[03:22:37.503 --> 03:22:42.206]  You will not be considered for employment at Delta Airlines if you have not had the shot in the arm.
[03:22:43.146 --> 03:22:55.431]  The article that I read this morning did not indicate what they were going to do with current employees of the airline, but now I just got an email from an employee at Delta Airlines.
[03:22:55.431 --> 03:23:04.514]  She screenshotted, or he screenshotted, the email from Delta Airlines to all employees that said, basically, you're going to take this shot in the arm or you're going to be fired.
[03:23:04.514 --> 03:23:06.475]  I've got about 30 seconds left here, Dr. Ruby.
[03:23:06.475 --> 03:23:07.075]  Any final words?
[03:23:08.556 --> 03:23:14.020]  Yeah, you know, in The Wizard of Oz, the Good Witch said, you have the power the whole time.
[03:23:14.020 --> 03:23:15.621]  You have the power.
[03:23:15.621 --> 03:23:29.371]  All of these flight attendants, particularly right now in Delta's corporation, band together and either left or went on strike, whatever, use their collective power to say no to Delta and leave.
[03:23:29.371 --> 03:23:32.053]  Leave them with no help.
[03:23:32.053 --> 03:23:33.915]  Again, it's not worth your life.
[03:23:34.475 --> 03:23:35.256]  Just wait.
[03:23:35.256 --> 03:23:37.177]  Hashtag, just wait.
[03:23:37.177 --> 03:23:41.879]  So if they did that, I think they'd turn Delta around immediately.
[03:23:41.879 --> 03:23:45.501]  But we appreciate you being here and I know that we'll talk to you again soon.
[03:23:45.501 --> 03:23:47.742]  Stick around for more of the Alex Jones Show right after this.
[03:23:47.742 --> 03:23:50.863]  My name is Stu Peters at VanMist.TV.
[03:23:50.863 --> 03:23:57.827]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[03:23:58.388 --> 03:24:03.912]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[03:24:03.912 --> 03:24:11.777]  But the good news is, we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[03:24:11.777 --> 03:24:13.238]  Humanity is strong.
[03:24:13.238 --> 03:24:14.219]  We're incredible.
[03:24:14.219 --> 03:24:17.981]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[03:24:17.981 --> 03:24:20.463]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[03:24:20.463 --> 03:24:26.387]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[03:24:26.627 --> 03:24:26.887]  Your brain.
[03:24:26.887 --> 03:24:27.207]  Your heart.

[03:25:51.925 --> 03:25:57.111]  People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year?
[03:25:57.111 --> 03:26:05.160]  Because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year, it's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution.
[03:26:05.160 --> 03:26:08.264]  And not just that, fuel and every other major commodity.
[03:26:08.524 --> 03:26:10.625]  The globalists want a post-industrial world.
[03:26:10.625 --> 03:26:12.446]  They're hitting us with economic war.
[03:26:12.446 --> 03:26:14.007]  I told you food prices would explode.
[03:26:14.007 --> 03:26:15.128]  They're now exploding.
[03:26:15.128 --> 03:26:18.109]  Our great sponsor, MyPatriot, has barely gone up in price.
[03:26:18.109 --> 03:26:21.891]  Their competitors have gone up even more, but they're about to go up in two weeks.
[03:26:21.891 --> 03:26:28.615]  But instead of just holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening, and then it's got to go up.

[03:26:52.049 --> 03:26:59.352]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[03:26:59.352 --> 03:27:06.155]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[03:27:06.155 --> 03:27:13.177]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[03:27:13.177 --> 03:27:17.699]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[03:27:17.979 --> 03:27:19.940]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[03:27:19.940 --> 03:27:22.540]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[03:27:22.540 --> 03:27:24.381]  Say goodbye to septic problems.
[03:27:24.381 --> 03:27:26.921]  Gas buildup and odor guaranteed.

[03:27:31.202 --> 03:27:41.305]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times more effective than its competitors.

[03:28:13.456 --> 03:28:16.120]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:21.246]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:28:24.634 --> 03:28:34.120]  You know, we've talked about the virus and the injection, the poison, the takeover, the hostile toppling, the lies of Anthony Fauci.
[03:28:34.120 --> 03:28:41.264]  He funded this thing, intentionally released it, used it to lock everyone down, distract away from everything that's going on.
[03:28:41.264 --> 03:28:49.650]  This is the criminal activity that we have seen that has actually been brought to light with no action whatsoever.
[03:28:49.650 --> 03:28:51.811]  The criminal activity of the cabal, the deep state,
[03:28:53.812 --> 03:29:04.796]  These globalist puppeteers that are manipulating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, all these people are so radical and so fake that we can see it every time that you turn on the mainstream media.
[03:29:04.796 --> 03:29:13.598]  When you look at even outlets that were typically conservative outlets, you now see it's very obvious that it's all fake.
[03:29:13.598 --> 03:29:15.819]  The pundits are fake.
[03:29:15.819 --> 03:29:17.300]  The witnesses are fake.
[03:29:17.300 --> 03:29:18.460]  The experts are fake.
[03:29:19.469 --> 03:29:28.556]  And these people are all manipulated by the likes of Soros, and the Rothschilds, and the Obamas, who, for all intents and purposes, he's in his third term here.
[03:29:28.556 --> 03:29:30.698]  He said that he was going to fundamentally change the country.
[03:29:30.698 --> 03:29:32.259]  Well, about that, he was not lying.
[03:29:32.259 --> 03:29:43.888]  And the crimes that have been committed that we know about are unfathomable, and we're now just only scratching the surface of this exposure.
[03:29:43.888 --> 03:29:45.229]  And the media, meanwhile,
[03:29:46.107 --> 03:29:51.510]  Seems to have moved on past the violent insurrection.
[03:29:51.510 --> 03:29:55.373]  And nobody wants to talk about it anymore, but we haven't forgotten about it.
[03:29:55.373 --> 03:30:02.297]  And Paul Gosar brought up a really great question the other day about where are these peaceful protesters?
[03:30:02.297 --> 03:30:05.359]  Where are these patriotic Trump supporters now?
[03:30:05.359 --> 03:30:08.621]  Are they still being hunted down by Joe Biden's FBI?
[03:30:08.621 --> 03:30:12.663]  Are they still being charged with misdemeanor trespassing?
[03:30:12.663 --> 03:30:15.505]  And then looking at three decades of imprisonment?
[03:30:17.589 --> 03:30:21.911]  The illusion of freedom is fake, also, right along with the media.
[03:30:21.911 --> 03:30:26.252]  Don't you dare talk about any of this intimidation.
[03:30:26.252 --> 03:30:28.553]  Don't you ever talk about any of this social pressure.
[03:30:28.553 --> 03:30:32.554]  Don't you ever talk about, you know, Ashley Babbitt again.
[03:30:32.554 --> 03:30:41.718]  Because now you're just a crazy, radical conspiracy theorist and you may be Baker-acted or involuntarily committed or drugged.
[03:30:41.718 --> 03:30:42.618]  They'll throw away the key.
[03:30:44.440 --> 03:30:46.641]  Well, my next guest is Lauren Witzke.
[03:30:46.641 --> 03:30:50.743]  She is the national spokesperson for the Hold the Line PAC.
[03:30:50.743 --> 03:30:53.704]  She is also not afraid at all.
[03:30:53.704 --> 03:30:54.704]  We won't be silenced.
[03:30:54.704 --> 03:30:56.425]  We still have questions about that day.
[03:30:56.425 --> 03:30:59.406]  We want answers for the deep state and the media lies.
[03:30:59.406 --> 03:31:07.229]  We want an immediate declassification of any intelligence surrounding what I would refer to as an execution of Ashley Babbitt.
[03:31:07.229 --> 03:31:08.170]  Lauren, thanks for being here.
[03:31:08.170 --> 03:31:08.930]  To that, you say what?
[03:31:10.110 --> 03:31:10.711]  Absolutely.
[03:31:10.711 --> 03:31:21.141]  You know, Paul Gosar, Congressman Gosar, has been the only elected official, the only Republican who has publicly even mentioned Ashley Babbitt's name.
[03:31:21.141 --> 03:31:23.603]  You know, she was murdered in cold blood, unarmed.
[03:31:24.684 --> 03:31:25.084]  I think so.
[03:31:43.102 --> 03:31:56.687]  That we, as Americans, Trump-supporting or conservative or Christian Americans, our lives don't matter or they matter less than people like George Floyd, who got justice for what happened to him.
[03:31:56.687 --> 03:32:00.489]  But people like Ashley Babbitt are beneath people like George Floyd.
[03:32:00.489 --> 03:32:01.549]  They're trying to condition us.
[03:32:01.949 --> 03:32:05.270]  And nobody is fighting for us except for Paul Gosar.
[03:32:05.270 --> 03:32:19.935]  He was the first one who wrote a letter to the FBI yesterday, I believe it was, or two days ago, trying to find out why young Americans who didn't even go into the Capitol building for the selfie insurrection are put on the no-fly list.
[03:32:19.935 --> 03:32:22.116]  People like me who didn't go in the building.
[03:32:22.116 --> 03:32:25.917]  Innocent, law-abiding protesters practicing our First Amendment right
[03:32:26.417 --> 03:32:35.620]  That's not an exaggeration of the truth either because I specifically, I can name a couple of names but one of them that sticks out in my mind is the political prisoner Sean Bradley Weitzman.
[03:32:35.620 --> 03:32:36.461]  He was a journalist.
[03:32:47.945 --> 03:32:52.228]  He's a journalist from here in the Minneapolis Twin Cities metropolitan area who went there.
[03:32:52.228 --> 03:32:53.089]  He did nothing.
[03:32:53.089 --> 03:32:58.392]  Everything that he did there was documented, either recorded or it was live on social media.
[03:32:58.392 --> 03:33:04.556]  If the guy was going to try to hide something, it would be ridiculous to believe that he would record himself in some sort of criminal activity.
[03:33:04.556 --> 03:33:16.204]  He was ushered into an open door, much like the single mother of a 10-year-old who's now looking at, been pregnant, looking at 30 years in prison for being escorted in by officers.
[03:33:16.204 --> 03:33:17.605]  The thing was a setup, Lauren.
[03:33:19.166 --> 03:33:20.067]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:33:20.067 --> 03:33:33.259]  You know, the gentleman that put his feet on Nancy Pelosi's desk, now he's facing 82 months in federal prison while we had rioters and looters burning federal buildings with federal officers inside in Portland.
[03:33:33.259 --> 03:33:35.201]  But like I said before, it's all conditioning.
[03:33:35.541 --> 03:33:46.028]  To condition us into believing that our lives are less value than the people who are on the left, the people like George Floyd, people like BLM, Antifa.
[03:33:46.028 --> 03:33:58.096]  They know, the FBI knows that there are cells of Antifa terrorists who go and agitate and set up Trump supporters or set up conservatives to disrupt and bash these
[03:33:58.416 --> 03:33:58.796]  I think so.
[03:34:21.541 --> 03:34:29.668]  Pastors dragging them through the streets in Canada and they're making sure that we see it here in the media because they're conditioning us because that's what's next.
[03:34:29.668 --> 03:34:40.116]  They're going to come and they're going to drag us through the streets and throw us all in prison just for our political beliefs and nobody in the Republican Party is standing up for us and shame on them.
[03:34:40.116 --> 03:34:48.402]  In fact, actually they joined in with the Fox News narrative, with the Newsmax narrative that we're domestic terrorists and that this is an insurrection.
[03:34:48.662 --> 03:34:50.503]  I couldn't even get out of D.C.
[03:34:50.503 --> 03:34:54.025]  after peacefully protesting outside of the Capitol building.
[03:34:54.025 --> 03:34:55.286]  I couldn't even get out of D.C.
[03:34:55.286 --> 03:34:58.167]  before they're calling for me to be thrown in Guantanamo Bay.
[03:34:58.167 --> 03:34:59.488]  These people are shameful.
[03:34:59.488 --> 03:35:01.349]  They're spineless and they're despicable.
[03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:02.850]  But they are starting to see that.
[03:35:02.850 --> 03:35:04.411]  And you knew exactly what happened.
[03:35:04.411 --> 03:35:06.872]  You saw exactly what occurred.
[03:35:06.872 --> 03:35:08.513]  You had a first-hand account.
[03:35:08.513 --> 03:35:17.258]  You knew that what was being reported in the media was a completely manufactured lie, including using a heroic cop in their narrative.
[03:35:17.844 --> 03:35:18.940]  To make us believe...
[03:35:19.679 --> 03:35:31.386]  That Trump supporting violent insurrectionist, murderous cop killers, wielding a fire extinguisher, savagely beaten in cold blood until he was dead.
[03:35:31.386 --> 03:35:34.067]  And now we know that to be a complete lie.
[03:35:34.067 --> 03:35:48.355]  You tried to blow the whistle saying on Newsmax that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer incited that violence and that insurrection by ignoring the call for security and ushering these people in there and you got your segment cut.
[03:35:48.795 --> 03:35:52.880]  You got your segment cut because that is not the narrative that fits.
[03:35:52.880 --> 03:35:54.943]  That is not the narrative that works.
[03:35:54.943 --> 03:35:57.246]  And this Ashley Babbitt execution...
[03:35:57.919 --> 03:36:10.247]  That was done in cold blood as part of the setup is the same cold blood that is now setting up everybody that was there, whether you were at the Ellipse or not, whether you were inside of the building or not.
[03:36:10.247 --> 03:36:12.128]  You could have been just in the D.C.
[03:36:12.128 --> 03:36:12.889]  area.
[03:36:12.889 --> 03:36:19.493]  If you're a Bank of America customer, no doubt you've been approached by the FBI wondering why you were spending money there at that time.
[03:36:19.993 --> 03:36:22.215]  There is no secret that you're right.
[03:36:22.215 --> 03:36:27.379]  Artur Pawlowski, who was jailed, the Polish pastor who was jailed in Canada, you are absolutely right.
[03:36:27.379 --> 03:36:29.320]  They are conditioning us for this.
[03:36:29.320 --> 03:36:38.928]  That is an amazing revelation, and we're going to keep you here because here's the question that I have for you, Lauren, and we only have a minute left, so I'm going to get you on the flip side of the break here.
[03:36:38.928 --> 03:36:41.150]  The question that I have for you is, now what?
[03:36:42.176 --> 03:36:44.798]  Because we see everything that's coming.
[03:36:44.798 --> 03:36:47.040]  We see people like Sean Bradley Weitzman.
[03:36:47.040 --> 03:36:51.764]  He's looking at misdemeanor charges that are carrying 30 years in prison.
[03:36:51.764 --> 03:36:54.706]  Somebody told these cops to walk away.
[03:36:54.706 --> 03:36:57.368]  Somebody told these officers to turn their back.
[03:36:57.868 --> 03:37:13.713]  When Ashley Babbitt was shot, now I worked in the law enforcement world for almost two decades, for 18 years, albeit as a bail enforcement agent, a bail investigator, a bounty hunter, whatever you want to call it, but I've been in a lot of scenes where critical incidents happened and so on and so forth.
[03:37:14.113 --> 03:37:22.057]  When an officer fires a gun, you better believe that every single asset in that department, and probably neighboring cities, are coming there.
[03:37:22.057 --> 03:37:23.958]  They're responding to calls.
[03:37:23.958 --> 03:37:29.641]  They're taking the pressure of a load of calls for service off of the department that was involved in the officer-involved shooting.
[03:37:29.641 --> 03:37:32.222]  They're there to help and give support wherever they can.
[03:37:32.222 --> 03:37:35.044]  These people just calmly walked away from this.
[03:37:35.684 --> 03:37:38.586]  And I'm not a tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorist.
[03:37:38.586 --> 03:37:40.186]  I'm the realist here.
[03:37:40.186 --> 03:37:41.427]  We are the realists.
[03:37:41.427 --> 03:37:42.287]  We are awake.
[03:37:42.287 --> 03:37:44.368]  Alex says if you're here, you're part of the resistance.
[03:37:44.368 --> 03:37:49.331]  We are part of the Great Awakening and more of it is coming up at Loren Witzke right after this on the Alex Jones Show at Bandness.tv.
[03:37:51.198 --> 03:38:01.642]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, made 14 years ago, accurately predicted the globalists' takeover using the Great Reset and the threat of a virus.
[03:38:01.642 --> 03:38:04.264]  This film is now more important than ever.
[03:38:04.264 --> 03:38:10.446]  I noticed just a few months ago that suddenly the limited supply we had at Infowarsore.com had sold out.
[03:38:10.446 --> 03:38:19.570]  That people were really talking about the documentary because major platforms like Amazon had banned it because the globalists had openly criticized the film, like the New York Times.
[03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:22.751]  And so we printed 20,000 copies.
[03:38:22.751 --> 03:38:27.712]  Now, back in print, and in less than two weeks, we've already sold half of them.
[03:38:27.712 --> 03:38:29.813]  This is very, very exciting.
[03:38:29.813 --> 03:38:35.614]  We're selling them close to cost at $3.95 a piece when you buy them in bulk, or $14.95 when you buy them individually.
[03:38:35.614 --> 03:38:40.075]  There is a zero country code on it, meaning you can copy this anywhere in the world.
[03:38:40.075 --> 03:38:40.376]  Get it.
[03:38:40.376 --> 03:38:41.636]  Earn copies.
[03:38:41.636 --> 03:38:42.576]  Share it with everyone.
[03:38:42.576 --> 03:38:43.696]  It's blowing people away.
[03:38:43.696 --> 03:38:44.557]  It's evergreen.
[03:38:44.557 --> 03:38:45.577]  It predicted it all.
[03:38:45.577 --> 03:38:45.877]  Endgame.
[03:38:45.877 --> 03:38:46.917]  Blooper for Global Enslavement.
[03:38:46.917 --> 03:38:49.578]  Available now, in DVD, and at bulwarkstore.com.
[03:38:51.044 --> 03:38:57.608]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say, thank you for what you've done.
[03:38:57.608 --> 03:38:59.549]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[03:38:59.549 --> 03:39:03.311]  Thank you for praying for us, and thank you for spreading the word.
[03:39:03.311 --> 03:39:13.737]  If all of you will simply go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or Droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[03:39:13.737 --> 03:39:19.140]  It will remind you every day like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[03:39:19.680 --> 03:39:25.644]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[03:39:25.644 --> 03:39:32.148]  And in this surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[03:39:32.148 --> 03:39:34.630]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[03:39:34.630 --> 03:39:37.152]  They're available at InfoWareStore.com in four different colors.
[03:39:37.753 --> 03:39:38.895]  And they are only $19.95.
[03:39:38.895 --> 03:39:43.663]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[03:39:43.663 --> 03:39:46.868]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the Infowar.
[03:39:46.868 --> 03:39:49.894]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the Infowar.
[03:39:52.475 --> 03:39:54.336]  It's Thursday morning, May 13th.
[03:39:54.336 --> 03:40:02.202]  I'm sitting in my studio getting ready to go live, and I am just cutting this bulletin to all the listeners and all the viewers to understand how serious the situation is.
[03:40:02.202 --> 03:40:08.466]  Just two weeks ago, I predicted you'd see massive inflation explode, that they would cut off more pipelines.
[03:40:08.466 --> 03:40:17.092]  I said it on air more than 50 times, because America is under strategic globalist attack in a economic trade war to make sure China wins.
[03:40:17.092 --> 03:40:18.913]  This is World War III.
[03:40:18.913 --> 03:40:22.295]  And I told listeners, you need to get storable food, you need to get water,
[03:40:22.335 --> 03:40:22.655]  I think so.
[03:40:52.941 --> 03:40:59.528]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients.
[03:40:59.528 --> 03:41:01.851]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S.
[03:41:01.851 --> 03:41:11.822]  injected healthy men, women, and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects.
[03:41:12.902 --> 03:41:16.945]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, is one of the most important films ever made.
[03:41:16.945 --> 03:41:23.730]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Vildenberg Group's activities, and their plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[03:41:23.730 --> 03:41:25.671]  The film now is more important than ever.
[03:41:25.671 --> 03:41:28.433]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[03:41:28.433 --> 03:41:38.720]  We have it back in print, available now, at Infowarsstore.com, selling them as low as $3.95 a piece when you buy them in bulk, and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet, you can make copies.
[03:41:38.900 --> 03:41:40.402]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[03:41:40.402 --> 03:41:42.444]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[03:41:42.444 --> 03:41:44.046]  1776 Worldwide.
[03:41:44.046 --> 03:41:44.927]  1776 Worldwide.
[03:41:44.927 --> 03:41:45.607]  In game.
[03:41:45.607 --> 03:41:46.929]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:41:46.929 --> 03:41:54.557]  Available now at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:41:54.557 --> 03:41:57.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:08.914 --> 03:42:10.522]  On a warm summer's eve.
[03:42:11.825 --> 03:42:13.286]  Hey, it's Stu Peters.
[03:42:13.286 --> 03:42:15.986]  Find me at StuPeters.TV.
[03:42:15.986 --> 03:42:18.707]  Also, reminder, here's a shameless plug for you.
[03:42:18.707 --> 03:42:21.548]  The truth always lives at RedVoiceMedia.com.
[03:42:21.548 --> 03:42:22.788]  Make sure that you give us a check.
[03:42:22.788 --> 03:42:24.589]  I really would appreciate it if you check us out.
[03:42:24.589 --> 03:42:25.389]  Come over and support us.
[03:42:25.389 --> 03:42:27.710]  We're there telling the truth all the time.
[03:42:27.710 --> 03:42:29.730]  RedVoiceMedia.com and StuPeters.TV.
[03:42:29.730 --> 03:42:32.131]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:32.131 --> 03:42:38.673]  She is a Republican who, by the way, garnered more votes than any other Republican in the history of our state.
[03:42:38.673 --> 03:42:39.573]  As a first-time run,
[03:42:40.197 --> 03:42:42.839]  She's the national spokesperson for the Hold the Line PAC.
[03:42:42.839 --> 03:42:44.821]  She's an America First, God-loving conservative.
[03:42:44.821 --> 03:42:46.322]  She's unafraid, and she joins us now.
[03:42:46.322 --> 03:42:47.263]  Her name is Lauren Witzke.
[03:42:47.263 --> 03:42:52.046]  You can find her on Gab at LaurenWitzkeDE, as in Delaware.
[03:42:52.046 --> 03:43:00.793]  Lauren, the way to stop this, I think, is obvious, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but getting loud seems to be really effective.
[03:43:01.371 --> 03:43:12.800]  Because if you look at what's happening in the world right now, the smallest fraction of a percent of people with the loudest bullhorns seem to be the ones that are making the most difference.
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:24.650]  When you talk about race baiters like Abram Kendi, people that are employed by Soros like Black Lives Matter Incorporated, these Antifa, purple-headed, crackpot, basement-dwelling video game players.
[03:43:24.650 --> 03:43:27.452]  These people are just making a lot of noise.
[03:43:27.452 --> 03:43:28.713]  They're burning things down.
[03:43:29.293 --> 03:43:34.397]  They're trapping law enforcement officers inside of buildings and lighting them on fire.
[03:43:34.397 --> 03:43:37.599]  They're throwing urine bombs at police officers.
[03:43:37.599 --> 03:43:39.020]  They are ruining businesses.
[03:43:39.020 --> 03:43:41.061]  They created an entire summer of carnage.
[03:43:41.061 --> 03:43:42.362]  We don't have to rehash it.
[03:43:42.362 --> 03:43:44.804]  Everybody knows what happened last summer.
[03:43:44.804 --> 03:43:46.085]  It's going to continue again.
[03:43:46.085 --> 03:43:47.906]  Riot season has only just begun.
[03:43:48.880 --> 03:43:55.809]  It's only a matter of time before another officer is involved with a critical incident or any use of force situation.
[03:43:55.809 --> 03:44:00.536]  And I know that you're not a law enforcement expert, but there's to weigh in on this.
[03:44:01.420 --> 03:44:03.341]  What is it that needs to be done?
[03:44:03.341 --> 03:44:10.546]  Are we looking at parents that are out in California right now, specifically in one district, that are standing up and saying, we've had enough of this critical race theory?
[03:44:10.546 --> 03:44:19.952]  I mean, they're really holding these people's feet to the fire right now, saying, no, we're not, I don't want my kids being taught like this.
[03:44:19.952 --> 03:44:22.894]  I don't want them reading from these books in school.
[03:44:23.834 --> 03:44:29.378]  I don't want them being taught that they are lesser of a person because they're white and they will never apologize for this.
[03:44:29.378 --> 03:44:30.339]  Is that what we need to do?
[03:44:30.339 --> 03:44:35.503]  Just take a hard stand right now and just, no, we're not doing it.
[03:44:35.503 --> 03:44:36.543]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:44:36.543 --> 03:44:39.225]  You know, we have got to stop the conditioning.
[03:44:39.225 --> 03:44:51.594]  We have to shut down and completely reject their narrative that we are not allowed to have a voice, that we deserve to be silenced, or that we deserve to be murdered just because we're conservative or supported Donald Trump.
[03:44:51.994 --> 03:45:06.610]  You know, what we saw with the school board, the parents literally drove out the school board who was trying to push critical race theory and they were doing the mask mandates and people, the parents took their rights back and they did it legally.
[03:45:06.610 --> 03:45:08.452]  People need to understand as a conservative, though,
[03:45:08.932 --> 03:45:18.019]  Biden's DOJ is weaponized against you, so if you do break the law, they will take it to the fullest extent and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.
[03:45:18.019 --> 03:45:25.645]  So we have to be extra careful to make sure that we protect ourselves, but you can make your voice heard.
[03:45:25.645 --> 03:45:28.467]  Yeah, how can you be careful but yet effective at the same time?
[03:45:28.467 --> 03:45:37.994]  Because if we're not allowed to be loud, you know, if we're not allowed to burn heads in the street and hold, I mean, we remember holding the bleeding head of the president in the air, I mean,
[03:45:39.010 --> 03:45:45.474]  These types of things, these liberal, radical, progressive terrorists, they get a pass.
[03:45:45.474 --> 03:45:59.583]  But God-fearing, Christian, Anglo-Saxon, white, patriot America, freedom-loving, liberty-embracing, red, white, and blue, blue-working, blue-collar workers, we get the shaft.
[03:45:59.583 --> 03:46:06.367]  We get incarcerated, viciously hunted down for taking a selfie at the Capitol and looking at 30 years of imprisonment.
[03:46:07.105 --> 03:46:12.255]  So really, what avenues do we have to take action?
[03:46:13.112 --> 03:46:15.073]  Well, you can get loud.
[03:46:15.073 --> 03:46:18.956]  You can build networks with your people and your friends.
[03:46:18.956 --> 03:46:22.179]  But also, you can hold your elected officials accountable.
[03:46:22.179 --> 03:46:28.503]  You know, we have been putting pressure on the Republican Party to stand up for the January 6th protesters.
[03:46:28.503 --> 03:46:29.143]  And you know what?
[03:46:29.143 --> 03:46:31.425]  Paul Gosar was a champion for us.
[03:46:31.425 --> 03:46:32.606]  He came through for us.
[03:46:32.606 --> 03:46:35.288]  He is the one who asked who killed Ashley Babbitt.
[03:46:35.288 --> 03:46:38.010]  He was the first elected official to do that.
[03:46:38.010 --> 03:46:40.912]  We should demand that from all of our Republican elected officials.
[03:46:41.352 --> 03:47:00.062]  And condemn them for joining in with Fox News' Newsmax's narrative that it was an insurrection, completely and utterly throwing us all under the bus and condemning us to the mercy of Biden's weaponized DOJ is what they did by listening and participating in that narrative that the left created.
[03:47:00.062 --> 03:47:03.063]  You know, they know that there are antifa cells everywhere.
[03:47:03.063 --> 03:47:08.006]  They know that there are domestic, the real domestic terrorists aren't white Christians.
[03:47:08.326 --> 03:47:10.487]  However, they hate us and they want us dead.
[03:47:10.487 --> 03:47:11.687]  They want us thrown in prison.
[03:47:11.687 --> 03:47:13.328]  They want to destroy our lives.
[03:47:13.328 --> 03:47:19.130]  So they are weaponizing and organizing every outlet they can now that they're in power to take it out against us.
[03:47:19.130 --> 03:47:20.391]  So we have to be vocal.
[03:47:20.391 --> 03:47:21.371]  We have to be loud.
[03:47:21.371 --> 03:47:23.172]  We have to combat their narrative.
[03:47:23.172 --> 03:47:24.532]  We have to completely reject it.
[03:47:24.532 --> 03:47:26.373]  And not only that, we have to mock it.
[03:47:26.813 --> 03:47:30.857]  You know, we have to mock these people and make them feel stupid, because you know what?
[03:47:30.857 --> 03:47:50.373]  A granny selfie insurrection, quote-unquote, you know, that is paled in comparison to the rioting, looting mob in the 2020 summer that we had that was pure hell, because we catered and allowed Black Lives Matter to burn our country to the ground, where Republicans, most of them, didn't say anything.
[03:47:50.373 --> 03:47:54.357]  People like Dan Crenshaw actually kicked the mob and took down those historical monuments.
[03:47:54.617 --> 03:47:55.179]  That's disgraceful.
[03:47:55.179 --> 03:47:56.703]  Ashley Paddock was executed.
[03:47:56.703 --> 03:47:58.407]  She was executed in cold blood.
[03:47:58.407 --> 03:47:59.449]  Yes she was.
[03:47:59.449 --> 03:48:01.194]  And nobody's saying a thing about it.
[03:48:01.194 --> 03:48:01.936]  Can you imagine?
[03:48:02.660 --> 03:48:12.862]  If that same situation would have happened on the streets of Baltimore, where, you know, the person that was shot would have been a black person and the cop would have been a white person.
[03:48:12.862 --> 03:48:15.623]  Can you imagine if that would have happened in Chicago?
[03:48:15.623 --> 03:48:17.923]  And then the entire police force just walks away.
[03:48:17.923 --> 03:48:19.984]  They just walk away like nothing ever happened.
[03:48:19.984 --> 03:48:22.464]  It's what happened inside of the Capitol building.
[03:48:22.464 --> 03:48:25.445]  The Capitol of the United States of America.
[03:48:25.445 --> 03:48:30.386]  A woman was gunned down by a law enforcement officer and nobody is saying a peep.
[03:48:30.926 --> 03:48:34.747]  Nobody is demanding justice for Ashley Babbitt whatsoever.
[03:48:34.747 --> 03:48:44.989]  It is an absolute travesty and I cannot believe the silence, the deafening silence that this media is just, they're completely shut down on this narrative.
[03:48:44.989 --> 03:48:49.351]  I mean, there's all of these theories about Ashley Babbitt not being dead and all this other stuff.
[03:48:49.351 --> 03:48:53.972]  Listen, the woman was shot and killed by a cop.
[03:48:53.972 --> 03:48:55.272]  Nobody is saying a thing.
[03:48:56.149 --> 03:49:07.616]  Yeah, and people were too afraid to even ask who killed her, you know, because they had conditioned us into believing that we were domestic terrorists when we were just peaceful protesters.
[03:49:07.616 --> 03:49:09.817]  You know, that is what was all over the news.
[03:49:09.817 --> 03:49:22.825]  Even news outlets that were supposedly on our side, like Fox News or Ben Shapiro, even Meghan McCain was saying that I needed to be thrown in Guantanamo Bay just for attending a peaceful protest sponsored by my president.
[03:49:22.825 --> 03:49:24.106]  You know, so there,
[03:49:24.586 --> 03:49:29.972]  There are certainly forces at work that hate us just as much as the Democrats do, even on our side.
[03:49:29.972 --> 03:49:32.955]  So we need to identify and weed these people out.
[03:49:32.955 --> 03:49:34.677]  But we have to take back our narrative.
[03:49:34.677 --> 03:49:36.199]  We have got to combat it.
[03:49:36.199 --> 03:49:42.886]  And we have got to not allow this to happen because it is all conditioning and it is built up to this point.
[03:49:42.886 --> 03:49:46.290]  And now it's becoming acceptable to throw a Trump supporter in prison for life.
[03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:53.937]  Just because they're conservative, or maybe have an outspoken opinion about something that the left doesn't like, the demonic left.
[03:49:53.937 --> 03:49:55.218]  It's also spiritual, too.
[03:49:55.218 --> 03:49:59.162]  It really is a spiritual battle, you know, with Christians right now.
[03:49:59.162 --> 03:50:01.223]  We are literally fighting evil.
[03:50:01.223 --> 03:50:03.325]  We are literally combating evil.
[03:50:03.325 --> 03:50:04.727]  But we have to speak it into life.
[03:50:04.727 --> 03:50:08.290]  We have God to stay loud, we've got to stay vocal, and we've got to stay involved.
[03:50:09.050 --> 03:50:12.651]  You know, taking back your local legislator is very important as well.
[03:50:12.651 --> 03:50:15.252]  Getting involved locally in your party.
[03:50:15.252 --> 03:50:20.553]  Replacing these rhino losers who are too violent for the school board.
[03:50:20.553 --> 03:50:26.234]  I mean, even your local PTA, all the stuff that you never really pay attention to at the ballot box, you need to do it.
[03:50:26.234 --> 03:50:26.994]  She said demonic.
[03:50:26.994 --> 03:50:30.175]  She was banned for it on Twitter because she's not scared of the truth.
[03:50:30.175 --> 03:50:32.436]  She's the national spokesperson for the Hold the Line PAC.
[03:50:32.436 --> 03:50:35.396]  Go find her on Gab at LaurenWitzki.de.
[03:50:35.396 --> 03:50:36.497]  Thank you so much for being here, dear.
[03:50:36.497 --> 03:50:37.277]  We really appreciate it.
[03:50:37.898 --> 03:50:41.142]  They're coming at you from every single angle.
[03:50:41.142 --> 03:50:43.025]  They're coming at you with the virus.
[03:50:43.025 --> 03:50:47.732]  They have crippled an entire country with a virus that has a 99.98% survival rate.
[03:50:50.347 --> 03:51:04.573]  They're making you take an injection that you know now, that I know now, that we know now, that medical experts have proven through studies, are going to cause catastrophic damage to your organs, to your bodily functions, and probably death.
[03:51:04.573 --> 03:51:07.334]  You have been primed for death once you take this thing.
[03:51:07.334 --> 03:51:09.275]  Still don't know if there's any way to reverse it.
[03:51:09.275 --> 03:51:13.537]  But they're going to make you go take it, or they're going to make your life a living hell, and now they're trying to disarm you.
[03:51:14.057 --> 03:51:20.342]  You may not know that if Texas falls with constitutional carry, they're coming after the rest of the country too.
[03:51:20.342 --> 03:51:24.266]  And right now there's an urgent battle in Texas for gun rights.
[03:51:24.266 --> 03:51:26.187]  Constitutional carry is under attack.
[03:51:26.187 --> 03:51:31.292]  New York Times does a 20,000 word essay on all the legislation that's happening down in Texas.
[03:51:31.292 --> 03:51:33.594]  They conveniently leave that one out.
[03:51:33.594 --> 03:51:34.594]  And guess what?
[03:51:34.594 --> 03:51:37.977]  Rhino Dan Patrick, the Lieutenant Governor down there, is fighting this thing.
[03:51:37.977 --> 03:51:41.140]  He's only steps away from Governor Greg Abbott's desk.
[03:51:41.844 --> 03:51:43.226]  It needs to pass.
[03:51:43.226 --> 03:51:47.270]  Call Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick down in Texas and let him know.
[03:51:47.270 --> 03:51:48.952]  I'm telling you folks, it's really important.
[03:51:48.952 --> 03:51:50.273]  They want to silence you.
[03:51:50.273 --> 03:51:51.254]  They want to disarm you.
[03:51:51.254 --> 03:51:56.580]  They need you vulnerable in order to take over if they don't kill you with the injection already.
[03:51:57.640 --> 03:51:58.140]  Wow.
[03:51:58.140 --> 03:51:59.621]  Owen Troyer is out.
[03:51:59.621 --> 03:52:02.723]  I guess Tom Pappert is going to be filling in on the war room.
[03:52:02.723 --> 03:52:05.125]  That's coming up next at BAM This TV.
[03:52:05.125 --> 03:52:05.965]  My name is Stu Peters.
[03:52:05.965 --> 03:52:09.027]  You can always find the truth at redvoicemedia.com.
[03:52:09.027 --> 03:52:11.249]  Make sure that you get over there to redvoicemedia.com.
[03:52:11.249 --> 03:52:14.030]  My show airs, The Stu Peters Show, Monday through Friday.
[03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:15.371]  That's weekdays 6 p.m.
[03:52:15.371 --> 03:52:18.793]  Eastern at stupeters.tv and I hope to see you over there.
[03:52:18.793 --> 03:52:22.896]  Boy, I tell you what, and here's what's up to it, here's what's down to it, and any way that you can get to it.
[03:52:22.896 --> 03:52:25.758]  And to those who don't do it, may they be dragged to it, tied to it, or forced to it.
[03:52:26.278 --> 03:52:28.522]  And here's to us who do do it, because we're the ones that's used to it.
[03:52:28.522 --> 03:52:30.666]  Remember to fly low and avoid the radar.
[03:52:30.666 --> 03:52:33.470]  One day they're going to come for the car, and when they do, save the radio.
[03:52:33.470 --> 03:52:34.572]  My name is Stu Peters.
[03:52:34.572 --> 03:52:36.815]  This is the Alex Jones Show on Bandness.tv.
[03:52:36.815 --> 03:52:37.416]  Thanks for having me.
