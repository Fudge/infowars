[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.223]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:30.350]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:42.118]  Welcome to discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies.
[00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:53.039]  Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability.
[00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.621]  Well, you can't blame this problem on somebody else.
[00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:03.063]  I have to tell you, what I'm hearing is very different from what you described.
[00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:09.826]  I'm hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we're re-engaged with our allies and partners.
[00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:22.720]  I'm also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.683]  Well, I think we thought too well of the United States.
[00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:27.704]  We thought that the U.S.
[00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:31.427]  side will follow the necessary diplomatic protocols.
[00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:39.578]  So for China, it was necessary that we make our position clear.
[00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:49.106]  So let me say here that in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.
[00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:09.599]  Well, I think we thought too well of the United States.
[00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.640]  We thought that the U.S.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.843]  side will follow the necessary diplomatic protocols.
[00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:18.947]  So for China, it was necessary that we make our position clear.
[00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:52.908]  So let me say here that in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of... The United States is now a joke by design.
[00:02:52.908 --> 00:03:00.070]  And you've got all the little woke mobs that work for the most destructive, bloodless corporations in the world.
[00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.690]  Even though they're on the payroll, they work for their own destruction.
[00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.712]  There's an excellent headline on Band.Video.
[00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:13.515]  David Icke has a channel on there and he uploaded it and it says it all.
[00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:19.457]  That the woke mob works for tyranny and they work against themselves.
[00:03:19.457 --> 00:03:28.962]  But you can't explain that to them because they're losers who don't have any basic street smarts and have no idea what they're even facing.
[00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:29.342]  There it is.
[00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:38.779]  Woke is a tyranny destroying freedom on the way to destroying itself.
[00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.920]  David Icke, Dot Connector.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.243]  Excellent report at band.video and it says it all.
[00:03:45.243 --> 00:03:55.309]  They have no idea what they're even doing, how the world even works, and it's just, it's mind-blowing.
[00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:09.943]  I thought when they rolled out their first bioweapon it would be more of a simulant and would not be that deadly, just a practice getting us all locked down ahead of much stronger attacks, which they've said indeed that's what they're doing.
[00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:12.865]  Gates and others admit this was all just a drill.
[00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:15.546]  But the vaccine itself is the next bio attack.
[00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:17.228]  It is the terror attack.
[00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:20.810]  And I'm really surprised at how deadly it is.
[00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.634]  I thought it would be more of a soft kill, which obviously it is, but it's so strong that it's killing a lot of people.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:35.585]  Right up front, we opened the phones up yesterday, didn't screen your calls, and we had a credible caller talk about their mamas and their daddies dying when they took it.
[00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:40.088]  And I can open the newspaper up and see all the death everywhere.
[00:04:40.088 --> 00:04:42.530]  But if you criticize it, you get banned off social media.
[00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:54.558]  Think of the crimes against humanity Big Tech is carrying out now, against we the people, trying to silence us, so that they can target the gullible out there for death.
[00:04:54.558 --> 00:04:56.239]  We are witnessing a true holocaust.
[00:04:58.753 --> 00:05:02.376]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:06.919]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:16.146]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:20.249]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:38.124]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:54.539]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.942]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[00:06:01.473 --> 00:06:03.999]  I don't think so.
[00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:31.290]  Welcome, my friends, to this live March 19th Friday worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.731]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I'm very honored to be here with you.
[00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:43.293]  We're going to have open phones in the second, third, and fourth hour today that I will be hosting.
[00:06:43.293 --> 00:06:52.155]  We will open the phones up for people that love vaccines, people that hate vaccines, people to call in with your positive stories, your negative stories, your
[00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:53.865]  You're in between stories.
[00:06:53.865 --> 00:06:58.006]  Of course, no one will call in with a positive story because they don't exist.
[00:06:58.006 --> 00:06:59.966]  At least not yet that we found them.
[00:06:59.966 --> 00:07:15.049]  But uncensored, we will open the phones up so that all the folks that have lost family members or people that have been paralyzed or people that have had convulsions or people that have gotten other neurological disorders or people that have had blood start pouring out of their eyeballs and ears.
[00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:18.550]  Well, we love to hear from the survivors out there, so that's in the
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.500]  Second, third, and fourth hour today.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.501]  They don't want you to have a voice.
[00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:29.242]  Big Tech is mercilessly shutting everyone down.
[00:07:29.242 --> 00:07:33.362]  I was on Andrew Schultz, one of the biggest comics in the world now.
[00:07:33.362 --> 00:07:37.943]  He's been around for 10 years, but he's definitely going to end up eclipsing Dave Chappelle.
[00:07:37.943 --> 00:07:40.164]  I mean, he gets more views on YouTube than Dave Chappelle does.
[00:07:40.164 --> 00:07:42.584]  His comedy special is more popular on Netflix.
[00:07:42.584 --> 00:07:44.644]  He's a really funny guy, especially on his feet.
[00:07:44.644 --> 00:07:47.925]  I've been a fan for a long time, and I had a chance to go on his show in Miami.
[00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:57.358]  And one of the co-hosts had taken the mRNA vaccine, and I said, you know it's a gene therapy, and that's associated with cancer.
[00:07:57.358 --> 00:08:06.887]  Well, sure enough, they took the episode down after it got 2.2 million views, and I talked to Schultz this morning and said, yeah, your guess was correct.
[00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:09.870]  It's because of medical misinformation.
[00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.573]  Oh, I have a whole stack of mainstream news, including the Associated Press,
[00:08:13.288 --> 00:08:16.249]  Saying that they never could approve mRNA vaccines.
[00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:23.833]  There were calls by international organizations of scientists to ban it because it's gene editing basically.
[00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:25.493]  It's a gene therapy.
[00:08:25.493 --> 00:08:28.355]  It can give rise to cancer.
[00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:38.339]  It's directly associated with cancer and that most cancer is a RNA or mRNA or messenger RNA or guide RNA trigger.
[00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:42.741]  And I've shown you all the top prestigious scientific firms, you name it, the last few days here on air.
[00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:45.071]  But think about that.
[00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:50.993]  Banned from a comedy show because they say it's medical misinformation.
[00:08:50.993 --> 00:08:52.453]  And where do they get that?
[00:08:52.453 --> 00:08:55.374]  Well, the UN.
[00:08:55.374 --> 00:08:57.514]  And why do I raise that today?
[00:08:57.514 --> 00:08:59.494]  Chris Skye is a Canadian.
[00:08:59.494 --> 00:09:00.895]  He's an activist.
[00:09:00.895 --> 00:09:08.196]  He's a long-term listener of this show for almost 20 years, since he was like 13, 14 years old.
[00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:10.477]  And they're still on lockdown where he's at in Canada.
[00:09:12.013 --> 00:09:17.457]  And so when he went to the store, he'd wear a mask, and they came to his house at night and tried to arrest him.
[00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:18.418]  But he knew the law.
[00:09:18.418 --> 00:09:23.902]  He knew that these are the code enforcer police that don't even really have arrest power.
[00:09:23.902 --> 00:09:36.232]  So then they don't arrest him after a 30-minute confrontation, but they sent over 20 police cars to his house, and were waiting for him to come out and get in the car.
[00:09:36.232 --> 00:09:40.996]  And they tell him, well, you went to the grocery store on March 12th.
[00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:44.007]  And did not wear a mask.
[00:09:44.007 --> 00:09:46.789]  And of course, there is no law.
[00:09:46.789 --> 00:09:51.993]  It's a, quote, regulation that just comes out of the provincial governors.
[00:09:51.993 --> 00:09:53.934]  And of course, they take the directive of the United Nations.
[00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:56.236]  So do you know what this is?
[00:09:56.236 --> 00:10:03.961]  Whether you live in Australia or Canada or in blue cities in the U.S., whether you live in Germany, whether you live in Scotland, Ireland, England, doesn't matter.
[00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:04.802]  The U.N.
[00:10:04.802 --> 00:10:06.383]  says what is okay.
[00:10:06.383 --> 00:10:08.605]  They say what the policies are.
[00:10:08.605 --> 00:10:10.386]  And then our governments follow them.
[00:10:11.064 --> 00:10:15.547]  And so literally, you don't need UN troops with blue helmets showing up.
[00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:20.050]  The police and the military are being put through the woke system.
[00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.530]  They're being marinated in it everywhere.
[00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.634]  And then they're being given these jobs to go out and do unconstitutional, authoritarian things.
[00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:29.155]  And this is how they disappear you in the future.
[00:10:29.155 --> 00:10:31.997]  And it was Australia a few months ago.
[00:10:31.997 --> 00:10:33.118]  Now it's Canada and the U.S.
[00:10:33.118 --> 00:10:40.062]  today, where in blue cities, they're coming and arresting people that organize constitutional demonstrations
[00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:45.829]  Against the illegal, unlawful mask mandates.
[00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:49.169]  And now they're rolling out the COVID passports.
[00:10:49.169 --> 00:10:50.050]  That's now official.
[00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.590]  And now they're rolling out the global social credit score.
[00:10:52.590 --> 00:11:01.171]  Now they're telling the military, actually, starting in July, these gene therapies will be mandatory.
[00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:02.092]  And so that's what this is.
[00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:09.213]  This is you in control, taking control of our very civilization and of our society.
[00:11:09.213 --> 00:11:09.973]  And I'm going to be
[00:11:11.511 --> 00:11:16.794]  Interviewing Chris Sky coming up in about T-minus 19 and a half minutes.
[00:11:16.794 --> 00:11:24.197]  So we'll also play you some of the shocking excerpts of the video that is online at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:11:24.197 --> 00:11:32.662]  But this is so dire when you can't say, hey, mRNA vaccines never got approved.
[00:11:32.662 --> 00:11:33.882]  They've been around for over a decade.
[00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:34.843]  They tested them in animals.
[00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:42.091]  That destroyed the immune systems of many animals, turned off the immune systems, or turned them way up where their organs liquefied.
[00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:47.612]  And you had the most prestigious scientific groups coming out and saying, we should never authorize these.
[00:11:47.612 --> 00:11:53.213]  And then Bill Gates and the UN and Fauci and the CHICOMS, who were already doing all this in China, launched this.
[00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.733]  And that's what they talk about.
[00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:56.774]  Oh, we have super soldiers.
[00:11:56.774 --> 00:12:03.215]  They've been injecting their troops for decades with gene-edited CRISPR-style technology.
[00:12:03.215 --> 00:12:03.335]  And
[00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:08.700]  They go, oh, you're not guinea pigs, you're super soldiers.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:19.327]  And they inject them to, quote, special mRNA messenger systems to make them have more stamina, bigger muscles, all of it.
[00:12:19.327 --> 00:12:24.111]  And so when you hear about this going on, that's what's happening here.
[00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:29.535]  And this is a revolution of being able to go into your body.
[00:12:29.535 --> 00:12:31.316]  Now they're saying 10 shots a year.
[00:12:31.997 --> 00:12:38.642]  And they're admitting, oh, it'll actually turn off your regular immune system for every new virus, every new cold virus, every new flu virus.
[00:12:38.642 --> 00:12:40.704]  You'll have to go get a shot.
[00:12:40.704 --> 00:12:44.607]  So they're turning us into the boy in the bubble.
[00:12:44.607 --> 00:12:47.970]  That's actually the articles I have, mainstream headlines.
[00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:56.577]  mRNA vaccines and gene therapies triggered cancers and quote, boy in the bubble
[00:12:57.555 --> 00:12:58.075]  Scenarios.
[00:12:58.075 --> 00:12:58.896]  That's a true story.
[00:12:58.896 --> 00:13:02.659]  The boy that didn't have an immune system, anything and everything would kill him.
[00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:03.460]  He had to live in a bubble.
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.442]  We can show you the famous footage of that.
[00:13:06.442 --> 00:13:09.144]  That's Pull-Up Boy in the bubble footage.
[00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:10.525]  That's what this is.
[00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:18.451]  So they're making you a commodity that they completely and totally control.
[00:13:18.451 --> 00:13:19.832]  And so this is a revolution.
[00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:23.274]  This is the final revolution.
[00:13:23.274 --> 00:13:24.195]  It's what they call it.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.442]  And so I'm going to spend some time on that today after Chris Sky comes and joins us.
[00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.783]  Then I'll hit that at the beginning of the next hour.
[00:13:32.783 --> 00:13:34.144]  A huge news.
[00:13:34.144 --> 00:13:39.806]  And then we will go to your phone calls throughout the broadcast.
[00:13:39.806 --> 00:13:43.967]  There's also the big news, obviously.
[00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:53.611]  And that is that Putin called Skeletor's bluff
[00:13:54.858 --> 00:13:56.720]  And said, listen, I wish you well.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.361]  I wish you good health.
[00:13:58.361 --> 00:14:02.644]  You're talking about, you know, seeing a Cold Stone killer look in the mirror.
[00:14:02.644 --> 00:14:04.006]  And I'd like to debate you.
[00:14:04.006 --> 00:14:07.488]  And Biden said he's too busy, too busy dealing with COVID.
[00:14:07.488 --> 00:14:09.990]  He means playing Mario Kart and drooling.
[00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.713]  And he's now been on video again, falling down, stumbling.
[00:14:13.713 --> 00:14:15.775]  That video's next segment.
[00:14:15.775 --> 00:14:21.560]  We've also got the video of him calling Kamala Harris, President Harris, yet, yet again.
[00:14:22.848 --> 00:14:25.569]  So this is all just emblematic of who we are.
[00:14:25.569 --> 00:14:34.432]  We all wear our little masks as a symbol that we're dirty and we're evil.
[00:14:34.432 --> 00:14:42.354]  This is all a giant Milgram experiment, PSYOP, and our putting up with it only encourages the globalists.
[00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:44.635]  But I will tell you this, the globalists will pay.
[00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:46.215]  They will go down for this.
[00:14:46.215 --> 00:14:49.476]  It's the nature of history, the nature of tyrants, the nature of megalomaniacs.
[00:14:49.476 --> 00:14:51.657]  They're going to push and push and push until

[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.562]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:30.928 --> 00:18:36.389]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to this live Friday, March 19 Global Transmission.
[00:18:36.389 --> 00:18:39.650]  Okay, I want to plunge back into COVID-19, because that's everything.
[00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:48.111]  That's the world government, that's the takeover, that's the medical tyranny, that's the global tracking, the tracing, that's the gene therapy, the gene editing.
[00:18:48.111 --> 00:18:58.873]  And we know from scientists that have been involved developing this stuff that they said it should not be approved in humans, it gives rise to cancer, it gives rise to sterilization, it just gives rise to a cornucopia of evil.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:05.685]  And they now admit does not protect you from any of the COVID-19 style coronaviruses.
[00:19:05.685 --> 00:19:08.668]  You've still got to wear a mask and you still can't congregate.
[00:19:08.668 --> 00:19:10.429]  It's just a total fraud.
[00:19:10.429 --> 00:19:15.914]  And it's a fraud up front, but people buy into the fraud, throw their logic out and say, I'm a hero.
[00:19:15.914 --> 00:19:16.674]  It's Halloween.
[00:19:16.674 --> 00:19:18.236]  I'm wearing a mask.
[00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:19.196]  I'm wearing two masks.
[00:19:19.196 --> 00:19:20.077]  I'm wearing three masks.
[00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:20.878]  I'm wearing a visor.
[00:19:22.737 --> 00:19:23.437]  And they've got you.
[00:19:23.437 --> 00:19:33.342]  But here's a big Zero Hedge article that's linked to Axios and a bunch of mainstream news, even admitting all this, that's what's crazy, is that all the places in the U.S.
[00:19:33.342 --> 00:19:41.866]  with the highest level of vaccination rates also have the highest level, suddenly, of saying that people that have COVID are dying of COVID.
[00:19:41.866 --> 00:19:50.070]  And you heard the callers, oh yeah, my dad died, or my boss died, after they got the second Moderna shot, the second Pfizer shot,
[00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.231]  But then they said that they died of COVID.
[00:19:53.231 --> 00:19:53.931]  Bingo!
[00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:57.513]  People that get the vaccine that are testing positive for COVID a month later.
[00:19:57.513 --> 00:19:59.654]  It's a fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:59.654 --> 00:20:01.454]  But what did even NPR say?
[00:20:01.454 --> 00:20:03.855]  What did the top scientists say?
[00:20:03.855 --> 00:20:05.796]  That I've been harping on for weeks.
[00:20:05.796 --> 00:20:12.999]  It goes in and creates deadly strains of real coronaviruses in your cells.
[00:20:12.999 --> 00:20:14.840]  Then you spew these off.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.240]  And then they have their new strains.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.361]  And so there's going to be real strains of this.
[00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:20.102]  There's going to be real killer viruses now.
[00:20:21.536 --> 00:20:24.757]  For anybody that doesn't have vitamin D, vitamin C, or zinc.
[00:20:24.757 --> 00:20:26.658]  Because any virus will kill you without it.
[00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:32.179]  Much less these new strains that are being created.
[00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:33.920]  Now let's move on to children.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.401]  What did the British government say in its quick study?
[00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:37.501]  Since it wasn't tested on animals.
[00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:46.004]  They did live guinea pig testing on hundreds of thousands of people and they said you should not give it to old people above 75, not to pregnant women, and not to under 16.
[00:20:48.223 --> 00:20:49.684]  And it grows all these weird tumors.
[00:20:49.684 --> 00:20:51.246]  I tell you, don't worry about those tumors.
[00:20:51.246 --> 00:20:53.808]  It's only a puma.
[00:20:53.808 --> 00:20:54.708]  None of this makes sense.
[00:20:54.708 --> 00:20:55.789]  It's all dystopic.
[00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:58.011]  Well, they had to start killing us at one point.
[00:20:58.011 --> 00:21:00.293]  Everything else has been just getting ready for this.
[00:21:00.293 --> 00:21:01.374]  This is just setting the table.
[00:21:01.374 --> 00:21:09.020]  The fluoride in the water, the GMO, the glyphosates, the breast cancer exploding, the tens of millions of autistic.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.141]  And they got away with that.
[00:21:10.141 --> 00:21:15.065]  Well, you don't think Johnson & Johnson didn't know their baby powder gave babies lung cancer?
[00:21:17.248 --> 00:21:20.871]  These guys are all in the eugenics movement.
[00:21:20.871 --> 00:21:23.673]  It's a mission for them.
[00:21:23.673 --> 00:21:28.017]  They're the ones putting all the opiates out, the ones selling us all the different poisons.
[00:21:28.017 --> 00:21:38.065]  And so now they're moving after the children, because if they can hit a baby, they can say, oh, the baby was always dim, the baby was always simple.
[00:21:38.065 --> 00:21:40.067]  If they can hit you when you're a newborn or six months old,
[00:21:40.914 --> 00:21:50.259]  It's not as obvious at the third round for boys at 18 months where they have the convulsion at the hospital, or at the clinic, or in the car, and then are autistic for the rest of their lives.
[00:21:50.259 --> 00:21:51.359]  That's a little too obvious.
[00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:55.822]  They've got a brain damage early in their culling op.
[00:21:55.822 --> 00:21:59.303]  And again, those vaccines aren't given in China.
[00:21:59.303 --> 00:22:02.145]  They're given in the countries that they want to sabotage and bring down.
[00:22:02.145 --> 00:22:06.427]  South Korea, Europe, the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, and that's where you have all the numbers.
[00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:11.481]  So these are things to weigh down our society, weigh down the parents, and destroy everything.
[00:22:11.481 --> 00:22:15.863]  Because again, boys have a blood-brain barrier half the strength of girls.
[00:22:15.863 --> 00:22:21.905]  Any doctor will tell you, and they knew this at the time of the Greeks, that females are more hardy than men.
[00:22:21.905 --> 00:22:29.949]  Men can fight, lift more weights, have more stamina, and have more mental stamina under pressure.
[00:22:29.949 --> 00:22:36.572]  But the body of a woman, because they can carry a baby, can take more poison per pound, lose more blood per pound,
[00:22:37.288 --> 00:22:38.229]  It's a fact.
[00:22:38.229 --> 00:22:43.792]  Ask any doctor that female fetuses, female babies, are twice as strong as male babies.
[00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:50.497]  And again, it escalates where some Africans have the highest level of stamina, and then men have the highest level of stamina.
[00:22:50.497 --> 00:22:53.399]  That's why all the world champion runners are black.
[00:22:53.399 --> 00:22:54.419]  It's a fact.
[00:22:54.419 --> 00:23:00.363]  Black males are even higher level of autism because their blood-brain barrier is even thinner.
[00:23:00.363 --> 00:23:04.266]  Because a Ferrari, again, is a high-tuned engine, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:08.996]  So that's how this works, and all the statistics are there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:08.996 --> 00:23:11.978]  So it hits men worse than anybody, and who's it hurt the worst?
[00:23:11.978 --> 00:23:16.040]  Black men!
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:29.748]  And so if you're a world champion middleweight boxer, marvelous Marvin Hagler, and you've got not much of a blood-brain barrier because you're also a boxer, what happens when you take that shot?
[00:23:29.748 --> 00:23:31.229]  Deader than a doornail.
[00:23:31.229 --> 00:23:32.630]  I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.091]  Let's go to the Monster Fauci
[00:23:35.083 --> 00:23:40.330]  Saying babies need the vaccine, and they're doing the illegal trials on babies and children now.
[00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.973]  This is Joseph Mingle at Level, here it is.
[00:23:43.487 --> 00:23:52.671]  For high school students, it looks like they will be available to get vaccinated in the beginning of the fall, very likely for the fall term.
[00:23:52.671 --> 00:24:02.014]  With regard to children, we're doing an age de-escalation study in elementary school children from 12 to 9, 9 to 6, 6 to 2, and 6 months to 2 years.
[00:24:07.396 --> 00:24:13.922]  We anticipate we'll have enough data to be able to vaccinate these younger children by the first quarter of 2022.
[00:24:13.922 --> 00:24:21.308]  And of course they always fix the data and take the deaths out of the study and always claim it was something else.
[00:24:21.308 --> 00:24:26.793]  A true monster who needs to pay for his crimes with Life in Prison at Supermax with Bill Gates.
[00:24:26.793 --> 00:24:31.197]  Here is a real doctor, Rand Paul, grilling the monster again yesterday.
[00:24:32.896 --> 00:24:36.220]  No evidence that there are significant reinfections after vaccine.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:43.410]  In fact, I don't think we have a hospitalization in the United States after the two-week period after the second vaccination.
[00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.893]  Yeah, you have a death in the United States.
[00:24:45.893 --> 00:24:48.817]  You're not hearing what I'm saying about variants.
[00:24:48.817 --> 00:24:50.559]  We're talking about wild-type
[00:24:54.042 --> 00:24:59.985]  What proof is there that there are significant reinfections with hospitalizations and death from the variants?
[00:24:59.985 --> 00:25:01.025]  None in our country.
[00:25:01.025 --> 00:25:01.625]  Zero.
[00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:05.467]  Well, because we don't have a prevalent of a variant yet.
[00:25:05.467 --> 00:25:09.269]  We're having 117 that's becoming more dominant.
[00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:12.730]  You're making a policy based on conjecture.
[00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.631]  No.
[00:25:13.631 --> 00:25:16.152]  It isn't based on conjecture.
[00:25:16.152 --> 00:25:18.834]  So you want people to wear a mask for another couple of years?
[00:25:18.834 --> 00:25:19.055]  No.
[00:25:19.055 --> 00:25:23.898]  You've been vaccinated and you parade around in two masks for show.
[00:25:23.898 --> 00:25:24.098]  No.
[00:25:24.098 --> 00:25:25.519]  You can't get it again.
[00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:31.864]  There's virtually zero percent chance you're going to get it and yet you're telling people that have had the vaccine and have immunity.
[00:25:31.864 --> 00:25:35.887]  You're defying everything we know about immunity by telling people to wear masks who've been vaccinated.
[00:25:36.287 --> 00:25:42.732]  Instead, you should be saying there is no science to say we're going to have a problem from the large number of people being vaccinated.
[00:25:42.732 --> 00:25:44.253]  You want to get rid of vaccine hesitancy?
[00:25:44.253 --> 00:25:47.396]  Tell them they can quit wearing their mask after they get the vaccine.
[00:25:47.396 --> 00:25:48.817]  You want people to get the vaccine?
[00:25:48.817 --> 00:25:55.241]  Give them a reward instead of telling them that the nanny state's going to be there for three more years and you got to wear a mask forever.
[00:25:55.241 --> 00:25:56.062]  People don't want to hear it.
[00:25:56.062 --> 00:25:57.623]  There's no science behind it.
[00:25:57.623 --> 00:26:02.387]  Well, let me just state for the record that masks are not theater.
[00:26:02.387 --> 00:26:03.708]  Masks are protective.
[00:26:04.128 --> 00:26:06.189]  And we have immunity there, Theodore.
[00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:09.570]  If you already have immunity, you're wearing a mask to give comfort to others.
[00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.171]  You're not wearing a mask at any time.
[00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:14.292]  I totally disagree with you.
[00:26:14.292 --> 00:26:15.012]  That's enough.
[00:26:15.012 --> 00:26:25.556]  Fauci wrote an article, a sign of it paper, in 2008 saying masks don't work and that it gives rise to bacterial pneumonia and kills more people, Spanish flu, 1918.
[00:26:25.556 --> 00:26:28.697]  And he then said early last year, don't wear a mask, they don't help.
[00:26:28.697 --> 00:26:29.237]  Because it's a fact.
[00:26:29.801 --> 00:26:32.103]  In fact, people say it's like a chain-link fence shooting a baby through it.
[00:26:32.103 --> 00:26:34.505]  It's actually, I did the math and looked at it.
[00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:41.530]  It's like having, on average, a 300-foot wide chain-link fence, each area of it wide, and you shoot a baby down it.
[00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.413]  Yeah, it's a joke.
[00:26:44.413 --> 00:26:51.438]  It's pure crap, and a lot of studies show it actually makes the globulins of water bigger, and so it actually helps carry viruses.
[00:26:51.438 --> 00:26:53.580]  It's a damn filthy diaper on your face!
[00:26:57.435 --> 00:27:04.398]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[00:27:04.398 --> 00:27:09.580]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:14.102]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[00:27:14.102 --> 00:27:19.184]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[00:27:19.184 --> 00:27:23.446]  It is the patriot of the world versus everybody else.
[00:27:24.845 --> 00:27:34.473]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:27:34.473 --> 00:27:38.596]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[00:27:38.596 --> 00:27:45.081]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[00:27:45.081 --> 00:27:50.245]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[00:27:50.245 --> 00:27:52.046]  So help me God.
[00:27:52.046 --> 00:27:52.806]  Infowars.com
[00:27:58.172 --> 00:28:01.895]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[00:28:01.895 --> 00:28:05.619]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[00:28:05.619 --> 00:28:08.222]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[00:28:08.886 --> 00:28:13.270]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:19.015]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[00:28:19.015 --> 00:28:30.625]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[00:28:31.245 --> 00:28:33.366]  I need your help more than ever now.
[00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:37.487]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[00:28:37.487 --> 00:28:48.089]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:28:48.089 --> 00:28:57.632]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[00:28:57.632 --> 00:28:58.272]  Thank you so much.
[00:28:59.017 --> 00:29:07.283]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're gonna love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[00:29:07.283 --> 00:29:08.164]  It is Down and Out.
[00:29:08.164 --> 00:29:09.985]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[00:29:09.985 --> 00:29:12.967]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[00:29:12.967 --> 00:29:16.029]  It's got 4 milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:18.591]  It's got 25 milligrams of passionflower.
[00:29:18.591 --> 00:29:22.234]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[00:29:22.234 --> 00:29:24.095]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm.
[00:29:24.415 --> 00:29:27.236]  And 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[00:29:27.236 --> 00:29:29.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[00:29:29.837 --> 00:29:32.898]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[00:29:32.898 --> 00:29:35.259]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:39.060]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.761]  It's incredible.
[00:29:39.761 --> 00:29:42.281]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:44.762]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.
[00:29:44.762 --> 00:29:49.284]  Get yours today, down and out, exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:29:49.284 --> 00:29:51.765]  40% off, out of the gates, with free shipping, while supplies last.
[00:29:52.546 --> 00:29:53.146]  I don't know.
[00:29:53.146 --> 00:29:59.371]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:29:59.371 --> 00:30:02.413]  My enemies are your enemies.
[00:30:02.413 --> 00:30:03.113]  They're the globalists.
[00:30:03.113 --> 00:30:04.674]  They're exterminists.
[00:30:04.674 --> 00:30:20.485]  They're a consortium of mad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires, whatever you want to call them, that are highly predatory and are setting up a false fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and
[00:30:21.523 --> 00:30:33.525]  Electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[00:30:33.525 --> 00:30:40.827]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the noose is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[00:30:40.827 --> 00:30:47.468]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the new world order, but
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:31:00.975]  At the end of the day, it's all about the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the end of the human system as we know it, and all its ashes, a nightmare being built, only admitting it can turn it around and stop it.
[00:31:00.975 --> 00:31:03.578]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:31:21.386 --> 00:31:26.370]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913.
[00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.433]  Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[00:31:32.456 --> 00:31:36.318]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[00:31:36.318 --> 00:31:37.658]  So Cyrus Jones.
[00:31:37.658 --> 00:31:41.160]  So Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.620]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:48.963]  33 minutes in to the first hour of this live Friday transmission.
[00:31:48.963 --> 00:31:53.064]  I'll open the phones up the second third and fourth hour and we'll cover the waterfront.
[00:31:53.064 --> 00:31:54.145]  There's so much to get to but
[00:31:55.797 --> 00:32:05.103]  If you're ever going to have a world government, a corporate world government, the best way to do it is build it around medicine, because people tend to submit to medical tyranny.
[00:32:05.103 --> 00:32:16.610]  And if you want to have a genetic revolution of the forced takeover of the human cells... Remember back in the day, people were mad at Monsanto having all these seed lines that wouldn't produce seeds that produce new plants?
[00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.853]  You had to go back to Monsanto each time just to get seeds?
[00:32:20.853 --> 00:32:21.413]  Well, by the year 2045,
[00:32:23.075 --> 00:32:23.736]  The U.N.
[00:32:23.736 --> 00:32:35.505]  and all the rest of them estimate, with pleasure, that we'll be completely sterile, unable to have children, but they say, don't worry, we'll create humanoids for you and implant those and grow them in a tank.
[00:32:35.505 --> 00:32:38.247]  We're talking about the children of men here.
[00:32:38.247 --> 00:32:47.755]  We're talking about a scientific takeover, a corporate takeover of the very body of humanity, telling us humans are obsolete, we're going to merge with machines, but the singularity is coming.
[00:32:49.287 --> 00:32:52.688]  Long before the hypothetical singularity comes, they have to bring us under their control.
[00:32:52.688 --> 00:32:59.849]  So remember Loretta Lynch when she wasn't having tarmac meetings with Bill Clinton about the Justice Department investigations?
[00:32:59.849 --> 00:33:06.171]  She said we need the UN to run our police departments and have a woke system.
[00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:12.012]  And now all over the world, governments follow the exact directives of the United Nations.
[00:33:14.036 --> 00:33:14.656]  And if the U.N.
[00:33:14.656 --> 00:33:16.337]  says take the vaccine, you better do it.
[00:33:16.337 --> 00:33:16.838]  And if the U.N.
[00:33:16.838 --> 00:33:18.278]  says no side effects, it's true.
[00:33:18.278 --> 00:33:18.779]  And if the U.N.
[00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:20.140]  says no deaths, it's true.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:20.760]  And if the U.N.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.763]  says mRNA vaccines aren't gene therapy, even though in all the literature they are, well, it isn't.
[00:33:25.763 --> 00:33:31.106]  You must only say what they said or keep your mouth shut.
[00:33:31.106 --> 00:33:40.171]  And now on top of it, all over the world we're told the WHO, the gold standard, why they said so.
[00:33:40.171 --> 00:33:42.072]  And the Strong City Initiative, they're going to run our police.
[00:33:42.912 --> 00:33:43.994]  They're going to run our military.
[00:33:43.994 --> 00:33:47.239]  They're going to run our medicine.
[00:33:47.239 --> 00:33:49.523]  They're going to run every single bit of it.
[00:33:49.523 --> 00:33:51.887]  They have done it.
[00:33:51.887 --> 00:33:54.371]  All they got to do is get rid of Trump, Bolsonaro, and a few others.
[00:33:54.371 --> 00:33:57.056]  Hell, Trump went along with the vaccines, thinking it was just a regular vaccine.
[00:33:57.816 --> 00:33:59.598]  They can know we're held hostage by the fear?
[00:33:59.598 --> 00:34:01.219]  Let's just take the shot and get out of the fear.
[00:34:01.219 --> 00:34:04.121]  Like Senator Paul said, but it's not just a regular shot.
[00:34:04.121 --> 00:34:08.665]  It goes in and changes the very protein inside your cells so they can't suppress cancer.
[00:34:08.665 --> 00:34:10.467]  So you can't suppress other illnesses.
[00:34:10.467 --> 00:34:11.908]  That's in the mainline literature.
[00:34:11.908 --> 00:34:15.771]  This is a ghastly takeover to destroy your immune system bare minimum.
[00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:19.314]  And the numbers of deaths are just rising and rising and rising.
[00:34:19.314 --> 00:34:25.179]  This is a very dangerous criminal group that just seethe and ooze with it.
[00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:49.885]  And I'm a busy man in the morning, a busy boy, a busy beaver, and I didn't have 30 minutes to watch, but I watched the whole thing of Chris Skye, backtowork.bz Instagram, real Chris Skye, of them at his house, in the dark, 20 plus police cars, and they're the traffic, they're on the traffic police, they're the code enforcers.
[00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:55.317]  That in Europe and Canada they've turned into regular police, now they're doing it here in Texas too, in Austin.
[00:34:55.317 --> 00:34:58.899]  But they don't even have the power to arrest him, it was just a summons to court.
[00:34:58.899 --> 00:35:03.241]  And he gets in their face, he backs them down, but this is police under UN edicts.
[00:35:03.241 --> 00:35:08.363]  They admit in these different provinces, we've played the videos, that they take orders from the UN.
[00:35:08.363 --> 00:35:12.064]  And hell, their Prime Minister says he takes orders from Xi Jinping!
[00:35:12.064 --> 00:35:14.305]  Played the clip yesterday!
[00:35:14.305 --> 00:35:17.767]  Even the National Post said, well, he did praise dictatorship, and they said, well, maybe that's good.
[00:35:19.008 --> 00:35:20.469]  So, that's what this is.
[00:35:20.469 --> 00:35:21.630]  It isn't coming, it's here.
[00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:35.221]  So here's a few minutes of Chris Sky, just a few hours ago, last night, or it was early in the morning, we'll find out from him, as he sits in his boss's car going to work, and this is what the 20 of them waiting outside his house, this is what happened.
[00:35:38.063 --> 00:35:38.684]  What did I do?
[00:35:38.684 --> 00:35:39.705]  What's the common nuisance?
[00:35:39.705 --> 00:35:40.365]  What did I do?
[00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:40.686]  Tell me.
[00:35:40.686 --> 00:35:42.728]  I'm not getting out of the car until you tell me.
[00:35:42.728 --> 00:35:43.488]  I'm not getting out.
[00:35:43.488 --> 00:35:45.450]  Look, cop there, cop there.
[00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:46.971]  I'm not getting out of the car.
[00:35:46.971 --> 00:35:47.872]  You're on my property.
[00:35:47.872 --> 00:35:49.293]  Get off my property.
[00:35:49.293 --> 00:35:50.654]  Everybody's watching this right now.
[00:35:50.654 --> 00:35:51.655]  It's live.
[00:35:51.655 --> 00:35:52.176]  It's live.
[00:35:52.176 --> 00:35:53.637]  And I'm going to bring people in the live.
[00:35:55.736 --> 00:35:56.577]  What disturbance?
[00:35:56.577 --> 00:35:59.059]  You said I caused a disturbance, I'm not getting out of the car!
[00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:00.380]  Call 911 everybody!
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.261]  Report this to York Region PD!
[00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:03.042]  Call the news!
[00:36:03.042 --> 00:36:03.902]  Call everybody!
[00:36:03.902 --> 00:36:05.664]  I want everybody to see this!
[00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:07.325]  I am not getting out of the car!
[00:36:07.325 --> 00:36:11.048]  They're trying to illegally arrest me, they're saying I caused a disturbance, I haven't done anything!
[00:36:11.048 --> 00:36:12.129]  What disturbance did I cause?
[00:36:12.129 --> 00:36:12.709]  What date?
[00:36:12.709 --> 00:36:14.611]  From March 12th when you were at Longo's.
[00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:16.092]  March 12th at Longo's?
[00:36:16.092 --> 00:36:17.253]  How did I cause a disturbance?
[00:36:17.253 --> 00:36:20.935]  I claimed a mask exemption, and I did my shopping, and I left!
[00:36:20.935 --> 00:36:22.817]  So you cannot arrest me, I'm not getting out of the car!
[00:36:23.357 --> 00:36:25.139]  Everyone has that on video.
[00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:27.521]  I claimed a mask exemption at Longo's.
[00:36:27.521 --> 00:36:29.803]  I did my shopping legally and left.
[00:36:29.803 --> 00:36:31.564]  That is not causing a disturbance.
[00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:33.186]  That is not causing a disturbance.
[00:36:33.186 --> 00:36:34.507]  That is not trespassing.
[00:36:34.507 --> 00:36:35.588]  I am not getting out of the car.
[00:36:36.716 --> 00:36:38.398]  I'll sign it under duress.
[00:36:38.398 --> 00:36:45.046]  I want everybody to know, they're forcing me to sign an illegal document under duress, so it's not legally binding, but I'll sign it, give it to me.
[00:36:45.046 --> 00:36:45.727]  Let me get a pencil.
[00:36:45.727 --> 00:36:55.398]  Oh yeah, see, they're gonna try to make me sign an illegal document for an illegal arrest, so they can try to put more conditions on me, so they can try to silence me from speaking, because they don't want me to say things like,
[00:36:56.115 --> 00:37:01.336]  Hashtag, just say no, because they know that that's going to ruin their little agenda.
[00:37:01.336 --> 00:37:02.076]  And they see?
[00:37:02.076 --> 00:37:03.756]  See how far they go, people?
[00:37:03.756 --> 00:37:05.097]  See what they try to do?
[00:37:05.097 --> 00:37:07.897]  See how many laws they try to break?
[00:37:07.897 --> 00:37:09.537]  Do you understand how this works?
[00:37:09.537 --> 00:37:16.638]  So this is why we need united non-compliance and balls of iron.
[00:37:16.638 --> 00:37:17.139]  Understand?
[00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:22.079]  I want everybody to see this is the kind of firepower they brought to my house.
[00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:23.160]  I want everybody to see it.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.860]  Half of them have already left.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.260]  Look at this.
[00:37:26.366 --> 00:37:27.087]  Look at this!
[00:37:27.087 --> 00:37:30.389]  They even blocked off, they even blocked off Keele Street!
[00:37:30.389 --> 00:37:32.691]  They blocked off both sides of Keele Street!
[00:37:32.691 --> 00:37:33.431]  Look!
[00:37:33.431 --> 00:37:34.792]  Look at this, guys!
[00:37:34.792 --> 00:37:35.493]  Look at this!
[00:37:35.493 --> 00:37:39.856]  They blocked off the entire... There are police cars going back.
[00:37:39.856 --> 00:37:41.217]  It looks like 300 yards.
[00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:43.519]  You can see them way off in the distance.
[00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:44.660]  This is totally insane.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.320]  It goes on and on.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.101]  It shows at least 20 cars.
[00:37:47.176 --> 00:37:57.062]  Joining us is the thought criminal, Chris Sky, who's all over international news, who's been exposing the tyranny, who last year predicted that they would put the pressure on, remove it, put it back on.
[00:37:57.062 --> 00:37:58.303]  They now admit that's the plan.
[00:37:58.303 --> 00:38:00.304]  It's a plan all over the world.
[00:38:00.304 --> 00:38:03.726]  It's just that Canada and Australia and places are ahead of us six months.
[00:38:03.726 --> 00:38:05.147]  It's all coming here, folks.
[00:38:05.147 --> 00:38:08.449]  They're going to clamp the controls down after this summer again.
[00:38:08.449 --> 00:38:10.050]  Many areas are still clamped down.
[00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.631]  The suicide's exploding, all of it.
[00:38:11.631 --> 00:38:14.473]  It's a plan to train us to be on house arrest and prisoners.
[00:38:14.733 --> 00:38:18.938]  Chris, tell us when this happened and any other details we should know.
[00:38:18.938 --> 00:38:21.742]  Okay, so I was actually coming home from the gym.
[00:38:21.742 --> 00:38:28.410]  I finished the gym at around midnight, and I was driving my boss's truck, which is very similar to my truck.
[00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.513]  I drive a white Range Rover, and so does he.
[00:38:30.513 --> 00:38:33.637]  I gave my car to an employee that day, so I ended up taking this truck.
[00:38:34.406 --> 00:38:35.587]  I was on my way home.
[00:38:35.587 --> 00:38:40.570]  I was getting shadowed by the OPP, which is the Ontario Provincial Police, which I thought was strange.
[00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:47.835]  They pulled me over basically just to do an identity check on me and asked me where I was going, which I thought was strange, with three cop cars.
[00:38:47.835 --> 00:38:48.976]  But then they identified me.
[00:38:48.976 --> 00:38:52.158]  They didn't say I was doing anything wrong, no speeding or nothing like that.
[00:38:52.158 --> 00:38:54.119]  So they basically said, you're free to go.
[00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:55.821]  Oh, sorry.
[00:38:55.821 --> 00:38:56.301]  So I left.
[00:38:57.393 --> 00:39:06.581]  One of them started following me, and he followed me right until I got to Keele Street, which is where I live, and then he backed off, so I was like, okay, maybe they just wanted to make sure I was going home.
[00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:20.093]  So I got to my house, I was in my driveway, I have a gate that's manual, so I was about to get out of the car and open the gate, and somebody in plain clothes that doesn't identify themselves shines a flashlight, and so I roll down the window, and they said, I'm under arrest, get out of the car.
[00:39:21.172 --> 00:39:30.258]  Right away I knew it was some kind of corrupt, bogus, off-the-books raid, because if they had me under arrest, that means they had a warrant for my arrest.
[00:39:30.258 --> 00:39:40.045]  And if they had a warrant for my arrest, when I just got pulled over 10 minutes ago by the OPP, they would have told me right there when they ran my name and ID, hey, you got an arrest warrant, we're going to take you.
[00:39:40.605 --> 00:39:42.866]  So I knew right away there was something fishy.
[00:39:42.866 --> 00:39:47.069]  I knew right away that they were basically just trying to kidnap me and get me to go along with it.
[00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:48.349]  So I said, what's the charge?
[00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:49.370]  What am I doing?
[00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:57.674]  And they tried to make it seem like it was about me going into a longos a couple weeks ago, or not even a couple weeks ago, like seven days ago, where I went in without a mask.
[00:39:57.674 --> 00:39:59.275]  They tried to say they weren't going to serve me.
[00:39:59.275 --> 00:40:03.798]  I told them I had a medical exemption, which is the law, and they can't refuse the service by law.
[00:40:03.798 --> 00:40:04.758]  It's not even a criminal.
[00:40:04.758 --> 00:40:05.959]  It has nothing to do with criminal.
[00:40:05.959 --> 00:40:07.260]  It's a bylaw in the first place.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.760]  So cops shouldn't even be involved.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.741]  Bylaw should be involved.
[00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:15.148]  And if Bylaw went there, Bylaw would tell them, you have to serve this young man, because that's the law.
[00:40:15.148 --> 00:40:19.894]  So I went in, they ended up giving me a bottle of maple syrup, I went to the till, I paid for it, and I left.
[00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:29.330]  So, even if I had done something in the store that constituted a criminal charge, I think they said it was common nuisance and public mischief, something like that.
[00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:35.053]  In Canada, that's called a summary offense, which means it's only arrestable if it's caught in the act.
[00:40:35.053 --> 00:40:38.454]  So if I was there doing it and the cops came at that time, they could arrest me.
[00:40:38.454 --> 00:40:42.456]  Sure, so over 20 cop cars came to ambush you to teach you a lesson.
[00:40:42.456 --> 00:40:46.378]  We're going to talk about it when we come back, but again, this is the UN directing this.
[00:40:47.165 --> 00:40:48.906]  In control of your police.
[00:40:48.906 --> 00:40:50.106]  It's absolutely out of control.
[00:40:50.106 --> 00:40:53.767]  People have to wake up to this being a global corporate takeover.
[00:40:53.767 --> 00:40:55.108]  We all follow China's lead.
[00:40:55.108 --> 00:40:56.868]  We'll be right back.
[00:40:56.868 --> 00:41:01.069]  Alex Jones here with the new InfoWars sale, and it is a fantastic sale.

[00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.591]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:04.912]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[00:42:04.912 --> 00:42:13.775]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:13.775 --> 00:42:23.217]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate
[00:42:23.217 --> 00:42:23.497]  Thank you.
[00:42:41.924 --> 00:42:50.395]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[00:42:50.395 --> 00:42:57.884]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:57.884 --> 00:43:01.068]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing Devil's Advocate on air.
[00:43:02.336 --> 00:43:05.178]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists.
[00:43:05.178 --> 00:43:14.203]  That the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[00:43:14.203 --> 00:43:15.965]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[00:43:15.965 --> 00:43:16.765]  They play God.
[00:43:16.765 --> 00:43:21.448]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[00:43:21.448 --> 00:43:24.470]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:25.891]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[00:43:25.891 --> 00:43:27.772]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level,
[00:43:29.176 --> 00:43:30.057]  I have the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:30.057 --> 00:43:31.898]  I have connection with God.
[00:43:31.898 --> 00:43:34.641]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:44.148]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power out of it.
[00:43:44.148 --> 00:43:50.053]  Whether you're just a steel worker, or a school teacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[00:43:50.053 --> 00:43:56.638]  And treating other people like they're animals, and you're God, is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[00:43:56.638 --> 00:43:57.319]  And that's a fact.
[00:43:58.166 --> 00:43:59.687]  The people are awakening.
[00:43:59.687 --> 00:44:02.408]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[00:44:02.408 --> 00:44:04.468]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[00:44:04.468 --> 00:44:06.829]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:13.452]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this.
[00:44:13.772 --> 00:44:25.060]  To steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:31.765]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[00:44:31.765 --> 00:44:33.207]  In their own words, they admit it.
[00:44:33.207 --> 00:44:37.610]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.051]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:41.132]  They're Faraday cages.
[00:44:41.132 --> 00:44:42.832]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[00:44:42.832 --> 00:44:44.813]  They work absolutely great.
[00:44:44.813 --> 00:44:53.697]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[00:44:53.697 --> 00:45:00.381]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[00:45:00.381 --> 00:45:02.942]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.281]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:22.481]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:45:22.481 --> 00:45:23.902]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:45:23.902 --> 00:45:29.723]  We're interviewing Chris Sky, a great activist, standing up against the Global Medical Journey takeover.
[00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:47.564]  Now coming up next hour after he leaves us, I'm going to get to the disintegration of Biden, the Chinese openly scolding his minions on international TV in Alaska yesterday, Putin making a total fool out of Biden after Biden threatened him and said, we're going to get you and all this.
[00:45:47.564 --> 00:45:50.804]  Now Biden falls down twice going up the stairs.
[00:45:50.804 --> 00:45:55.806]  I mean, he is on another planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:55.806 --> 00:45:56.446]  I mean, wow.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.963]  Oh, he tried to do that big fancy man, tough guy climb.
[00:46:02.963 --> 00:46:07.845]  And he fell down twice.
[00:46:07.845 --> 00:46:09.987]  This is all emblematic, all done on purpose.
[00:46:09.987 --> 00:46:12.308]  This is the guy they stole the election for.
[00:46:12.308 --> 00:46:13.408]  Simply insane.
[00:46:13.408 --> 00:46:15.510]  And he called Kamala Harris President Harris again.
[00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:17.991]  Hope the left's happy with what you've done.
[00:46:17.991 --> 00:46:19.132]  You want the country to go down?
[00:46:19.132 --> 00:46:19.632]  Well, it is.
[00:46:21.593 --> 00:46:25.575]  And they'll be so stupid, just like in Venezuela, they'll ask for more free stuff and more communism.
[00:46:25.575 --> 00:46:28.237]  And things will get worse, and they'll ask for more, and they'll get worse.
[00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:29.498]  Because that's the nature of these people.
[00:46:29.498 --> 00:46:31.659]  They have a spiritual disease in their minds.
[00:46:31.659 --> 00:46:33.800]  Going back to Chris Sky.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:39.164]  Chris, again, for people that don't know who you are, most people do, you're one of the leading activists exposing, predicting all this.
[00:46:39.164 --> 00:46:44.527]  In fact, cue up last year where he predicted that they'd bring the lockdowns back when he was, right when he got back from Ireland.
[00:46:46.167 --> 00:46:48.529]  Again, this is what's coming for everybody in the future.
[00:46:48.529 --> 00:46:51.591]  They admit in Canada they've built secret facilities.
[00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:59.455]  Now your Prime Minister makes you for 14 days go pay to be in a government hotel when you fly back to Canada, but the borders are wide open basically.
[00:46:59.455 --> 00:47:01.736]  This is just insane.
[00:47:01.736 --> 00:47:08.841]  Where is all this going and why do they have to back down from saying you're under arrest, having to admit that you weren't under arrest?
[00:47:08.841 --> 00:47:09.581]  What were they thinking?
[00:47:10.478 --> 00:47:14.120]  Well, first of all, the most important part of this video is where it's going and why they were targeting me.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.361]  So I'm just going to go real quick about what happened.
[00:47:16.361 --> 00:47:17.862]  Obviously, it was an illegal police raid.
[00:47:17.862 --> 00:47:19.523]  Obviously, I knew they didn't have authority.
[00:47:19.523 --> 00:47:26.347]  The way I held them accountable is I went on a live and I even asked any Canadians that were in the area to come there to support me.
[00:47:26.347 --> 00:47:29.068]  And sure enough, when they're on camera, they knew they couldn't touch me.
[00:47:29.068 --> 00:47:30.089]  They knew they couldn't arrest me.
[00:47:30.089 --> 00:47:31.750]  They knew I wasn't going to give in.
[00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:35.292]  And when dozens of actual Canadian patriots showed up,
[00:47:36.078 --> 00:47:37.859]  They literally chased the police away.
[00:47:37.859 --> 00:47:38.859]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:40.060]  It was very touching.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.301]  It made me inspired to be a Canadian.
[00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:56.967]  But the real thing we need to take away from this is not the police corruption, not that this came from, I'll call them out right now, this was straight from John Tory, Mayor John Tory and Premier Doug Ford, and that's what everyone needs to blame if they want to blame somebody, because that's where this order came from.
[00:47:57.367 --> 00:47:58.948]  But the reason is why I'm being targeted.
[00:47:58.948 --> 00:48:03.772]  And the reason I'm being targeted is because, like you said, we're exposing this medical tyranny that they're trying to impose on us.
[00:48:03.772 --> 00:48:05.973]  And it's easy to expose when you know the endgame.
[00:48:05.973 --> 00:48:08.175]  And the endgame is the vaccine passport.
[00:48:08.175 --> 00:48:09.916]  They're openly talking about it now.
[00:48:09.916 --> 00:48:20.704]  And that's why, like you mentioned, they have these ridiculous travel restrictions where they want Canadians to pay for their own forcible confinement in a government quarantine facility full of potentially sick people and then go to their house.
[00:48:21.337 --> 00:48:24.619]  When you can just go to your house, and the government tries to pretend this is for your safety.
[00:48:24.619 --> 00:48:27.120]  Obviously it's not about for your safety, it's about controlling you.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:38.885]  And by the way, I have three different provincial governors and leaders admitting they've got secret camps and they're grabbing people that have parties and stuff to punish them, taking them to those facilities, but then they have national news saying it doesn't exist.
[00:48:38.885 --> 00:48:44.908]  So we have the regional governors, we have the city councils admitting it, but then separately they say it doesn't exist.
[00:48:45.962 --> 00:48:48.265]  No, obviously they exist and obviously they're putting people in them.
[00:48:48.265 --> 00:48:49.786]  Some of them are known, some of them aren't known.
[00:48:49.786 --> 00:48:53.911]  They're even changing the locations of the ones that were known because they were getting too much publicity.
[00:48:53.911 --> 00:48:56.934]  But once again, the endgame is this vaccine passport.
[00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:58.856]  And they pretend it's about travel.
[00:48:58.856 --> 00:49:00.618]  It has really nothing to do with travel.
[00:49:00.618 --> 00:49:02.880]  They want to make it part of every facet of your life.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.424]  If they can get compliance of about 75% of the population to go along with it,
[00:49:06.864 --> 00:49:09.565]  Then vaccine passport will become mandatory for travel.
[00:49:09.565 --> 00:49:15.986]  Then it will become mandatory for work, for going to the gym, for going to a concert, a hockey game, basketball game, etc.
[00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:16.967]  And that's what they want.
[00:49:16.967 --> 00:49:29.730]  They want to be able to impose a medical tyranny on you where you have no choice but to take this mRNA experimental concoction, we can't even call it a vaccine because it doesn't meet the definition of vaccine, that's untested, not FDA approved.
[00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:34.831]  You're right, it's a gene therapy, mutagenic, franken-weapon.
[00:49:35.717 --> 00:49:43.240]  Whatever they want, whatever we want to call it, the point is they want to be able to inject you with it multiple times a year, every year for the rest of your life as a pretense to live your life.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:51.424]  So to combat this, I created an awareness campaign called hashtag just say no and we're getting everybody on Instagram to make a wall post
[00:49:51.684 --> 00:49:52.045]  We're good to go.
[00:50:08.148 --> 00:50:08.928]  We're good to go.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.161]  People need to get these videos out and they haven't banned you yet.
[00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:34.641]  Why is that?
[00:50:34.641 --> 00:50:35.621]  They can't ban you.
[00:50:35.621 --> 00:50:38.862]  How can they ban you for telling people that they have a choice to say no?
[00:50:38.862 --> 00:50:41.623]  They admit that they can't mandate this vaccine.
[00:50:41.623 --> 00:50:43.964]  So they're going to try to coerce you every which way possible.
[00:50:43.964 --> 00:50:46.084]  They're going to try to make your life as miserable as possible.
[00:50:46.084 --> 00:50:49.025]  So you're like, oh, I might as well just get it so we can go back to normal.
[00:50:49.025 --> 00:50:49.885]  No, you have rights.
[00:50:49.885 --> 00:50:50.545]  You have freedoms.
[00:50:50.545 --> 00:50:52.866]  You don't need... I'm trying to tell folks, tell folks.
[00:50:52.866 --> 00:50:53.306]  Absolutely.
[00:50:53.306 --> 00:50:55.927]  The people working at Big Tech are going to be hit by all this as well.
[00:50:55.927 --> 00:50:58.948]  We've got to wake up at some point about this big pharma takeover.
[00:50:58.948 --> 00:50:59.928]  Tell people the hashtag again.
[00:51:01.036 --> 00:51:30.742]  It's hashtag just say no and we want so many people to do it that that hashtag just say no becomes synonymous with just say no to the COVID vaccine and once this becomes really well known we're going to do real ads all over major American cities because we want people to ask those kinds of questions like why are you why are doctors saying to their patients that this vaccine is safe when there is absolutely no long-term safety or efficacy data it's not FDA approved it never completed human trials never even tried to go through animal trials
[00:51:31.102 --> 00:51:36.685]  And it's a concoction that's never before been used on mankind on a grand scale ever.
[00:51:36.685 --> 00:51:43.749]  And we have a company like Moderna that's never even made a product ever for human consumption, made or distributed.
[00:51:43.749 --> 00:51:49.812]  And the first product ever that they make for mass inoculation is an experimental concoction that they're calling a vaccine.
[00:51:49.812 --> 00:51:53.574]  And we've seen already thousands and thousands of reports of hospitalizations,
[00:51:54.394 --> 00:52:00.538]  Adverse reactions and even deaths in all age groups of the population, especially in the higher age groups.
[00:52:00.538 --> 00:52:05.962]  We already have, what, 16 countries ban the AstraZeneca vaccine, which isn't even an mRNA vaccine.
[00:52:05.962 --> 00:52:07.422]  I think it's more than 25, 25 plus, yeah.
[00:52:07.422 --> 00:52:10.404]  It's up to 25 now?
[00:52:10.404 --> 00:52:10.965]  Well, yeah.
[00:52:10.965 --> 00:52:17.429]  So yeah, get a vaccine for a virus that has a 99.9% prescribable rate for up to people age up to 50.
[00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.449]  I think so.
[00:52:34.944 --> 00:52:42.609]  Multiple times a year, because your vaccine passport will expire virtually every six months, and we know you have to take two shots every six months.
[00:52:42.609 --> 00:52:48.413]  So you're looking at four shots a year, so you can go to work, so you can travel, so you can go see your friends.
[00:52:48.413 --> 00:52:49.374]  And I always knew this.
[00:52:49.374 --> 00:52:50.855]  Gates a year ago said five shots.
[00:52:50.855 --> 00:52:53.517]  Now they're talking about, brother, you may have missed it, ten shots a year.
[00:52:54.617 --> 00:52:55.657]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:52:55.657 --> 00:52:58.959]  They already got babies getting 60 shots before they're 18 years old.
[00:52:58.959 --> 00:53:00.619]  When I was growing up, it was like something like 13.
[00:53:00.619 --> 00:53:02.840]  So what do you think is going to happen?
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.781]  Oh, that's straight off of the Twitter.
[00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:06.081]  So that's the Twitter version of it.
[00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:10.683]  People are just writing hashtag Just Say No on the actual post and in the caption.
[00:53:10.683 --> 00:53:17.746]  It's very important to put it in the caption because then when people actually search that, all the Just Say No's that have ever been will go up.
[00:53:17.746 --> 00:53:21.947]  And on Instagram, there's about 280,000 posts with Just Say No.
[00:53:21.947 --> 00:53:23.968]  And I'm telling the listeners, this show is copyrighted.
[00:53:23.988 --> 00:53:24.308]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.536 --> 00:53:40.958]  Because everybody asks me every day, what can I do?
[00:53:40.958 --> 00:53:41.679]  But what can I do?
[00:53:41.679 --> 00:53:42.659]  But what can I do?
[00:53:42.659 --> 00:53:44.261]  So I said, this is something you can do.
[00:53:44.261 --> 00:53:48.244]  You can tell everybody that they're not alone in asking questions.
[00:53:48.244 --> 00:53:51.006]  They're not alone in questioning why we should take this vaccine.
[00:53:51.006 --> 00:53:53.488]  They're not alone in not wanting to take it.
[00:53:53.488 --> 00:54:00.714]  And when more and more people ask questions and more and more people raise this awareness, the idea of the vaccine passport becomes unpalpable for the general population.
[00:54:00.714 --> 00:54:01.435]  And that's what we need.
[00:54:01.435 --> 00:54:03.236]  Because that's their endgame.
[00:54:03.236 --> 00:54:06.499]  And these people that keep thinking, you have to comply to get through this.
[00:54:06.499 --> 00:54:07.400]  No, it doesn't work like that.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:14.086]  Because if the vaccine passport is step 10, they've got to go through step 1 through 9 before they can get to the vaccine passport.
[00:54:14.086 --> 00:54:19.070]  And every time you comply with the next step, they move to step 1, to step 2, to step 3.
[00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:24.895]  As soon as you don't comply with, say, step 4, they can't move forward to the vaccine passport agenda.
[00:54:24.895 --> 00:54:26.376]  Chris, stay there.
[00:54:26.376 --> 00:54:27.637]  I want to do a couple more segments.
[00:54:27.637 --> 00:54:28.398]  You've got to go.
[00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:29.759]  I've got a bunch of news and calls to take.
[00:54:29.759 --> 00:54:31.401]  But you have been a visionary.
[00:54:32.094 --> 00:54:36.598]  In the last year exposing all this and everything you talked about came true because you're reading their own documents.
[00:54:36.598 --> 00:54:46.927]  Explain to people when we come back, take some time to explain how they need you to submit through these processes, how we know it's staged, how they admit it is a process of bringing us into tyranny.
[00:54:46.927 --> 00:54:49.189]  Like the UK said, oh no, we're not going to have passports.
[00:54:49.189 --> 00:54:52.152]  Now they go, well, we are introducing them, but you don't have to have them.
[00:54:52.152 --> 00:54:53.914]  But next year they'll be mandatory.
[00:54:53.914 --> 00:54:55.175]  Or they say, oh, don't worry.
[00:54:57.413 --> 00:54:58.956]  We're not going to make you wear bracelets.
[00:54:58.956 --> 00:54:59.917]  They're freedom bracelets.
[00:54:59.917 --> 00:55:02.081]  Now they've passed a law in Israel to make people wear them.
[00:55:02.081 --> 00:55:04.004]  We're going to come right back to you in just a minute.
[00:55:08.143 --> 00:55:08.383]  Go ahead.
[00:55:08.383 --> 00:55:08.963]  Well that's it.
[00:55:08.963 --> 00:55:10.884]  They all do it color of law so that the sheep will follow it.
[00:55:10.884 --> 00:55:13.045]  Then the globalists leave themselves and out because they're not taking this.
[00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:30.532]  We've caught them all on tape, not taking the shot.
[00:55:30.532 --> 00:55:31.794]  Netanyahu, all of them.
[00:55:31.794 --> 00:55:35.057]  We'll be right back on the other side with Chris Sky.
[00:55:35.057 --> 00:55:39.823]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and Band.Video.

[00:57:51.553 --> 00:57:54.214]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:06.909 --> 00:58:10.952]  The response to COVID is a lot worse than COVID.
[00:58:10.952 --> 00:58:12.614]  And COVID isn't about a virus.
[00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:22.121]  It's about increasing government control over our lives by using fear tactics to make people comply with giving up the rights and freedoms that millions of people fought and died for.
[00:58:23.363 --> 00:58:32.229]  Cool, and what do you say to the people, we spoke to some of the people across the street, they're saying you guys are all stupid, that a lot of them say mandatory mask outside is what they want.
[00:58:32.229 --> 00:58:35.191]  How do you respond to people who are against what you're standing for here today?
[00:58:35.191 --> 00:58:38.353]  Well, the fact of the matter is, I just came from Netherlands.
[00:58:38.353 --> 00:58:42.615]  The Dutch are not stupid people, they're smart, they're independent, and they have balls.
[00:58:42.615 --> 00:58:43.536]  So guess what?
[00:58:43.536 --> 00:58:44.997]  They have no masks.
[00:58:44.997 --> 00:58:46.438]  They have 17 million people,
[00:58:47.196 --> 00:58:51.822]  If you go to a train station, maybe 1 out of 20 people is scared enough to wear a mask.
[00:58:51.822 --> 00:58:53.244]  Their bars are open.
[00:58:53.244 --> 00:58:54.786]  The girls are still working.
[00:58:54.786 --> 00:58:56.768]  You can go smoke a joint in their coffee shops.
[00:58:56.768 --> 00:58:58.410]  You can eat in their restaurant.
[00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.593]  They're open till 2 o'clock in the morning.
[00:59:00.593 --> 00:59:02.896]  And they've had less than 200 people up to age 60 die.
[00:59:04.798 --> 00:59:09.422]  Also, Amsterdam is one of the top three cities in all of Europe for international travel.
[00:59:09.422 --> 00:59:11.844]  50 million visitors a year from all over the world.
[00:59:11.844 --> 00:59:17.348]  This is a video of him in September of last year, and he predicted that lockdowns would come back again.
[00:59:17.348 --> 00:59:21.572]  He's gonna join me tomorrow for a special broadcast.
[00:59:21.572 --> 00:59:23.954]  It's gonna be taped to air, so it's like it's live.
[00:59:23.954 --> 00:59:25.115]  I'm gonna start taping at noon.
[00:59:25.115 --> 00:59:26.356]  I'm gonna go for two hours.
[00:59:27.296 --> 00:59:32.100]  Then we can add a lot of articles and documents that really boost the show up.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:34.481]  And then it'll start streaming taped to air.
[00:59:34.481 --> 00:59:35.963]  It's like it's live, but it's not.
[00:59:35.963 --> 00:59:37.904]  At 4 p.m.
[00:59:37.904 --> 00:59:38.945]  Central tomorrow.
[00:59:38.945 --> 00:59:41.507]  That way it'll be basically commercial free.
[00:59:41.507 --> 00:59:44.009]  And streamed over the M4's network and any stations that want to pick it up.
[00:59:44.009 --> 00:59:45.710]  But everybody loves those Saturday shows.
[00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:47.271]  They always go viral.
[00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:51.134]  Because Saturday's a dead time, but there's actually not much media being put out on Saturday.
[00:59:51.134 --> 00:59:53.736]  So we find, so Saturday goes the most viral.
[00:59:54.588 --> 00:59:56.590]  So I appreciate Chris Guy coming on.
[00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:59.414]  In the three minutes we've got now, we'll talk about it more tomorrow.
[00:59:59.414 --> 01:00:00.915]  You're a smart cookie.
[01:00:00.915 --> 01:00:02.938]  You laid out everything in the last year.
[01:00:02.938 --> 01:00:05.441]  What's coming next with these monsters?
[01:00:05.441 --> 01:00:07.243]  Oh my God, you read my friggin' mind.
[01:00:07.243 --> 01:00:08.945]  That's exactly what I wanted to talk about.
[01:00:08.945 --> 01:00:11.067]  Because right now, I've been trying to warn people.
[01:00:11.067 --> 01:00:14.311]  I did lives about this a couple months ago to tell people this is going to happen.
[01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.353]  They're going to declare a third wave.
[01:00:16.353 --> 01:00:19.520]  They've already pretty much declared it with their mainstream media, even though there's nothing.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:25.472]  They even started building a giant field hospital at Sunnybrook Hospital that's going to be completely empty unless the vaccinated people start getting sick.
[01:00:26.758 --> 01:00:28.239]  They're going to declare a third wave.
[01:00:28.239 --> 01:00:30.299]  They've already been pretending like they're trying to open us.
[01:00:30.299 --> 01:00:33.501]  In reality, it's the next bait and switch, and they're going to try to lock us down.
[01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:43.365]  They know that if they can lock us down now, they can lock us down until probably about May, and they're going to knock out another 10-15% of Canada's businesses, which is like chopping another arm off of the country.
[01:00:43.365 --> 01:00:44.845]  And that's their plan.
[01:00:44.845 --> 01:00:45.926]  Their plan is to not
[01:00:46.446 --> 01:00:51.010]  They're planning to let you think you're coming off this lockdown, but really they're going to declare this third wave in Canada.
[01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:52.391]  I'm talking about Canada right now.
[01:00:52.391 --> 01:00:53.432]  I don't know about the rest of the world.
[01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:54.333]  Oh, they're doing it here for sure.
[01:00:54.333 --> 01:00:55.754]  They're going to do it right.
[01:00:55.754 --> 01:00:57.395]  I think they'll launch it in August.
[01:00:57.395 --> 01:00:59.457]  I think by August, they'll announce the third wave.
[01:00:59.457 --> 01:00:59.817]  What do you think?
[01:01:00.618 --> 01:01:03.081]  No, no, here they're already announcing it as we speak.
[01:01:03.081 --> 01:01:20.478]  Like, as I speak, they're announcing the so-called third wave in Canada, in Ontario, right now, and probably by next week, next week or, yeah, probably next week they're going to start telling people that they're going to be pulling the emergency brake on opening and they're going to start rolling people back into what they call the grey zone.
[01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:26.621]  Sure, and then for us later, we're always six months behind you guys and other countries, because they beta-tested there first.
[01:01:26.621 --> 01:01:27.661]  I totally agree with you.
[01:01:27.661 --> 01:01:30.442]  Like, I've seen them saying, oh, we may not be able to reopen.
[01:01:30.442 --> 01:01:31.943]  So again, they dangle in front of you.
[01:01:31.943 --> 01:01:37.846]  Well, it's like Biden said, maybe you can have a backyard cookout if you behave yourself on July 4th.
[01:01:37.846 --> 01:01:39.266]  Yeah, that's basically what they're telling you.
[01:01:39.266 --> 01:01:42.068]  They're basically telling you, sorry guys, it's too dangerous.
[01:01:42.068 --> 01:01:43.228]  It's too dangerous to open up.
[01:01:43.228 --> 01:01:44.649]  It's too dangerous to allow you to work.
[01:01:44.649 --> 01:01:46.950]  It's too dangerous to remove these travel restrictions.
[01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:49.271]  The answer is to recall every one of their asses.
[01:01:50.818 --> 01:01:53.780]  Yeah, we got to hold every single one of them accountable.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.361]  Remember when the masks were supposed to be for one month, people?
[01:01:56.361 --> 01:01:58.182]  Now it's been over a year.
[01:01:58.182 --> 01:02:00.223]  If the masks were going to work, they would have worked by now.
[01:02:00.223 --> 01:02:04.025]  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
[01:02:04.025 --> 01:02:08.047]  So now they're doubling down on the masks and they extended the mask mandate indefinitely.
[01:02:08.047 --> 01:02:09.347]  It doesn't even expire in 2022.
[01:02:09.347 --> 01:02:11.809]  So what do you think they're planning on doing?
[01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:14.270]  You think they're planning on giving you your lives and your freedoms back?
[01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:18.432]  Or you think they're planning on prolonging this year after year after year the longer they can get you to comply?
[01:02:18.972 --> 01:02:22.796]  I have people that, I ask people why they're complying and I have three different answers.
[01:02:22.796 --> 01:02:25.378]  One person, some people are afraid of the virus, that's very few.
[01:02:25.378 --> 01:02:29.141]  A lot of people are afraid of the government or afraid of getting kicked out of the store.
[01:02:29.141 --> 01:02:37.229]  And then the other very common answer, which is the most terrifying to me, and I want this to be the last thing people hear, is people say they just want to follow the rules.
[01:02:38.078 --> 01:02:41.200]  How do you follow rules that are 100% against your best interest?
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.644]  How do you follow rules that you know are going to destroy your family and ruin your child's future?
[01:02:45.644 --> 01:02:47.365]  That lead you to a horrible place.
[01:02:47.365 --> 01:02:48.226]  You're a hero, Chris.
[01:02:48.226 --> 01:02:51.168]  You make me feel better to know there are men and women like you out there.
[01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:51.808]  We love you.
[01:02:51.808 --> 01:02:52.929]  We'll talk to you tomorrow, sir.
[01:02:52.929 --> 01:02:53.349]  God bless.
[01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.850]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:57.046 --> 01:03:05.097]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[01:03:05.097 --> 01:03:06.178]  It is Down and Out.
[01:03:06.178 --> 01:03:08.001]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:11.005]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[01:03:11.005 --> 01:03:11.666]  It's got four
[01:03:11.906 --> 01:03:12.866]  We're good to go!
[01:03:33.291 --> 01:03:35.774]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh.
[01:03:35.774 --> 01:03:37.075]  Talk about blasting off of sleep.
[01:03:37.075 --> 01:03:37.776]  It's incredible.
[01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:40.299]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[01:03:40.299 --> 01:03:42.782]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:13.832]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:04:13.832 --> 01:04:16.373]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:04:16.373 --> 01:04:19.454]  What would happen if you gave Bill Gates truth serum?
[01:04:19.454 --> 01:04:36.498]  Well, really what you'd get, he admits he wants to depopulate the earth, wants to get rid of old people, thinks humans are horrible, his dad ran Planned Parenthood, the World Eugenics Society, his mother headed up the foundation of the founder of IBM for eugenics, he was the number two guy under Hitler, Thomas Watson, ran Cold Springs Harbor.
[01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:37.838]  Can't make this up!
[01:04:38.467 --> 01:04:48.133]  Yeah, Cold Spring Harbor actually trained the Nazis, trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute that actually trained the Nazis, and Joseph Mingala that trained at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[01:04:48.133 --> 01:04:50.574]  And so he pretty much tells you what he's going to do to you.
[01:04:50.574 --> 01:05:02.861]  But an animator put together some of the real quotes of Gates, along with some of the things that are actually said in their white papers, like Operation Lockstep, Event 201, and others, and this is what they came up with, and it's damn accurate.
[01:05:02.861 --> 01:05:04.462]  So this is Bill Gates on Truth Serum.
[01:05:06.044 --> 01:05:08.105]  Hello, useless eaters.
[01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:20.647]  As your unqualified, non-elected global human health overlord, I'd like to take this opportunity to flaunt my position of power and influence over society, and share some of my plans for you and your future.
[01:05:20.647 --> 01:05:31.330]  When I amassed my fortune in computer software, I demonstrated that I was willing to lie, steal code, cheat my partners, and exercise monopolistic control to destroy my competitors.
[01:05:32.026 --> 01:05:36.170]  Now that I've retired, I can rebrand myself as a humanitarian.
[01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:47.860]  With my for-profit foundation MassGrading as a charity, I can advocate for population reduction and sponsor mass human experiments with unproven vaccines in vulnerable populations.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:59.223]  Like my father, a powerful banker, eugenicist, and Rockefeller crony himself, it's always been my ambition to decide who lives and, more importantly, how many have to die.
[01:05:59.223 --> 01:06:08.945]  Whether it's under the guise of climate change or world health, it's really all about controlling and culling the human herd for fun and profit.
[01:06:08.945 --> 01:06:15.607]  In November of last year, I hosted Event 201, a war game simulation of a global pandemic.
[01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:28.503]  Leaders from private corporations, global banks, governments, and the media got together to strategize ways they could align and lockstep when responding to a worldwide health crisis.
[01:06:28.503 --> 01:06:38.692]  Using a coordinated campaign of fear-mongering, intimidation, social shaming, and economic blackmail, we realized that we could get around dangerous philosophies
[01:06:38.712 --> 01:06:39.213]  We're good to go.
[01:06:57.739 --> 01:07:04.322]  Now imagine my excitement when we had the opportunity to release, uh, declare our own global pandemic.
[01:07:04.322 --> 01:07:15.707]  It was my chance to look like the Nostradamus of public health and to position myself and business partners like Dr. Fauci as the de facto authorities on response and solutions.
[01:07:16.147 --> 01:07:26.095]  Through exaggerated doomsday scenarios and computer simulations, our petty control freaks instituted harsh rules and draconian lockdowns.
[01:07:26.095 --> 01:07:36.224]  Even after our dire predictions proved false, scared and well-meaning people continued to submit to the arbitrary and foolish demands of their so-called leaders.
[01:07:36.884 --> 01:07:49.928]  Having achieved global lockdown and medical martial law, we'll continue to hold hostage your ability to congregate, work, travel, or do just about anything until we're prepared to roll out our bigger plan.
[01:07:49.928 --> 01:07:55.390]  I'd like to call this Pandemic One, because believe me, we have others in the works.
[01:07:55.390 --> 01:08:02.792]  Our final solution is to have you begging for us to vaccinate, tag, and digitally track each one of you like livestock.
[01:08:03.092 --> 01:08:16.017]  Not only will my foundation enjoy legal immunity and trillions in profits, but these mandatory experimental vaccines will move us so much further down the road to absolute centralized global control.
[01:08:16.017 --> 01:08:22.280]  If only my good friend Jeffrey Epstein had been here to celebrate with me aboard the Lolita Express.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.582]  So remember, global citizens, this will end when I say it ends.
[01:08:26.582 --> 01:08:29.683]  Could be a year, maybe two years, maybe never.
[01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:36.261]  I guarantee that if we have our way, it will be at least until you're not able to do anything to stop it.
[01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:45.324]  Just surrender your personal freedom and common sense to our fear merchants in government and the media, because none of this works unless you all go along with it.
[01:08:45.324 --> 01:08:51.666]  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to do some augmented reality spirit cooking with Marina Abramovich.
[01:08:51.666 --> 01:08:52.106]  Bye now!
[01:08:53.371 --> 01:08:56.753]  Thanks to you kids, we now know the virus is a hoax.
[01:08:56.753 --> 01:09:01.175]  They included flu, pneumonia, and other infections to boost the numbers.
[01:09:01.175 --> 01:09:02.936]  Let's find out who is really behind it all.
[01:09:02.936 --> 01:09:09.619]  Like, President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[01:09:09.619 --> 01:09:12.181]  Gigi Ping?
[01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:13.321]  Dr. Fauci?
[01:09:13.321 --> 01:09:16.703]  Like I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not scare them.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.061]  Microsoft's Bill Gates?
[01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:26.545]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's population.
[01:09:26.545 --> 01:09:27.165]  I get it.
[01:09:27.165 --> 01:09:32.588]  So Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak.
[01:09:32.588 --> 01:09:33.729]  That's diabolical.
[01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:35.590]  Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.
[01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:36.911]  Don't worry, kids.
[01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:40.373]  These globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time.
[01:09:40.373 --> 01:09:44.535]  Where they're going, they'll be locked up for a long good while in the big house.
[01:09:45.095 --> 01:09:47.277]  Yeah!
[01:09:47.277 --> 01:09:50.059]  Better than a rock round at home!
[01:09:50.059 --> 01:09:51.760]  But not if big tech has its way!
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:10:02.588]  All right, we did it for an hour yesterday, and it was incredible.
[01:10:02.588 --> 01:10:05.650]  It was incredibly nightmarish, but they don't want you to be heard.
[01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:11.314]  They don't want you to tell your story, what happened, you took the vaccine, or what happened to your father, your mother, your neighbor.
[01:10:11.314 --> 01:10:13.636]  They've tried to silence, you know, the families of
[01:10:14.784 --> 01:10:18.047]  Famous sports stars that have died after taking the vaccine.
[01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:27.816]  And here we are on over 200 radio stations, over 100 TV and cable stations, and of course at Band.Video with audio and video streams and fullworks.com.
[01:10:27.816 --> 01:10:29.318]  And our audience is so precious.
[01:10:29.318 --> 01:10:34.703]  It's a giant audience, but the system does everything it can to keep us from reaching new people.
[01:10:34.703 --> 01:10:36.805]  That's why everything is about you.
[01:10:37.765 --> 01:10:41.266]  Sending out the live links to the show from InfoWars.com.
[01:10:41.266 --> 01:10:42.306]  Put the live feed up, please.
[01:10:42.306 --> 01:10:43.966]  I want to show people the name of today's show.
[01:10:43.966 --> 01:10:46.187]  We give each show a title.
[01:10:46.187 --> 01:10:54.949]  Getting the articles, getting the videos on your text message, on your email, on your word of mouth, getting those out to people so they understand the truth.
[01:10:54.949 --> 01:10:59.130]  People are very, very hungry right now.
[01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.110]  There's the headline.
[01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:01.530]  Must watch Friday live.
[01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:03.010]  The Mark of the Beast is here.
[01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.971]  Walmart joins Communist China-EU.
[01:11:07.699 --> 01:11:10.400]  With medical social credit score.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.161]  And here it is out of the New York Times.
[01:11:12.161 --> 01:11:13.842]  Walmart becomes largest U.S.
[01:11:13.842 --> 01:11:18.344]  vaccine provider to join push for digital vaccine credentials.
[01:11:18.344 --> 01:11:22.385]  They say you may even need it in the future to go in their store.
[01:11:22.385 --> 01:11:23.966]  Oh, remember they had the U.N.
[01:11:23.966 --> 01:11:24.706]  call for it all.
[01:11:24.706 --> 01:11:26.347]  People go, oh, that'll never happen.
[01:11:26.347 --> 01:11:26.887]  I said, you watch.
[01:11:26.887 --> 01:11:29.288]  I'll just keep calling for it till you get used to it.
[01:11:29.288 --> 01:11:30.109]  Now in the U.K.
[01:11:31.604 --> 01:11:33.005]  They promised they wouldn't do it.
[01:11:33.005 --> 01:11:34.567]  It was a conspiracy theory.
[01:11:34.567 --> 01:11:35.708]  The internal documents came out.
[01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.711]  They were planning a year ago to roll this out.
[01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:41.694]  That was an Operation Lockstep ten years ago.
[01:11:41.694 --> 01:11:43.676]  Crimson Contagion two years ago.
[01:11:43.676 --> 01:11:44.657]  It's all planned out.
[01:11:44.657 --> 01:11:48.080]  And everything they plan out, they pull until we say no.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.962]  So they're just hitting us with everything they've got right now.
[01:11:50.749 --> 01:11:59.451]  No government will authorize mRNA gene therapy because in the human studies it caused so much cancer and death and boy-in-the-bubble syndrome.
[01:11:59.451 --> 01:12:00.272]  Look it up.
[01:12:00.272 --> 01:12:03.632]  Showed you Mainline News yesterday.
[01:12:03.632 --> 01:12:16.556]  And so now they're just bum-rushing us on every single front and they're admitting that the vaccines are actually causing new virus strains that are actually deadlier than what was happening before.
[01:12:16.556 --> 01:12:16.956]  Which again,
[01:12:18.374 --> 01:12:19.334]  It's part of the plan.
[01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:23.836]  It's in the Rockefeller Foundation documents that I'm going to hit at the start of the next hour.
[01:12:23.836 --> 01:12:25.157]  But I want to give the number out.
[01:12:25.157 --> 01:12:37.062]  I want to take your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen, specifically on one subject in this first hour.
[01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:40.163]  Because we have a phone system that takes 20 calls.
[01:12:40.163 --> 01:12:42.464]  And I probably only get like 10 calls an hour.
[01:12:42.464 --> 01:12:44.285]  But when I go through that board of calls,
[01:12:47.313 --> 01:12:52.816]  Then I'm going to open the phones up again, because I'm going to be hosting the fourth hour, so we've got a lot of time today.
[01:12:52.816 --> 01:13:00.260]  So let's say at the bottom of the next hour, we will shift out of that all-important topic to another big one, end-of-the-world stuff.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:07.484]  Biden's people being absolutely shut down by the Communist Chinese at the first big summit in Alaska yesterday.
[01:13:07.484 --> 01:13:09.405]  Total disrespect for Biden.
[01:13:09.405 --> 01:13:12.687]  Total disrespect for America by North Korea, because they know he's a puppet.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:18.682]  And on their payroll, and Biden said, I'm gonna let Xi Jinping do whatever he wants.
[01:13:18.682 --> 01:13:22.304]  He can run Hong Kong, he can run Taiwan, he can kill the Uyghurs if he wants.
[01:13:22.304 --> 01:13:25.405]  Remember what he said on CNN?
[01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:27.106]  That's the real policy.
[01:13:27.106 --> 01:13:33.529]  And so China doesn't see that as strength, they see that as weakness, so they rub our nose in it on international TV.
[01:13:33.529 --> 01:13:35.389]  And Putin didn't start it.
[01:13:35.389 --> 01:13:39.431]  Biden said, I'll take him out of the shed and kick his ass like he said about Trump.
[01:13:39.431 --> 01:13:40.552]  He's like, well, you know,
[01:13:42.975 --> 01:13:46.216]  He's a killer, he's a piece of garbage, he's about to get it.
[01:13:46.216 --> 01:13:47.156]  We're about to show him.
[01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:51.616]  And this is all coming out of these globalist idiots.
[01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:55.937]  Who absolutely or totally bought off and sold out a bunch of dirtbag lawyers.
[01:13:55.937 --> 01:13:58.538]  Actually bought this, it blocks UHF frequency.
[01:13:58.538 --> 01:14:03.799]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[01:14:03.799 --> 01:14:10.640]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.300]  With or without a battery.
[01:14:13.072 --> 01:14:19.175]  Now, with the InfoWars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[01:14:19.175 --> 01:14:20.036]  Excellent.

[01:16:21.455 --> 01:16:23.196]  It's The Alex Jones Show!
[01:16:23.196 --> 01:16:26.677]  Starring Alex Jones and Owen Schroyer!
[01:16:28.075 --> 01:16:30.597]  Harrison Smith and the rest of the great crew!
[01:16:30.597 --> 01:16:37.903]  But I tell you, we're not in Mayberry anymore, are we?
[01:16:37.903 --> 01:16:39.945]  No, we're not.
[01:16:39.945 --> 01:16:47.611]  Imagine if you could get in a time machine and go back into the past.
[01:16:47.611 --> 01:16:48.412]  Would you go there?
[01:16:48.412 --> 01:16:49.553]  You know, I don't think I would.
[01:16:49.553 --> 01:16:52.575]  Because back then we had our own problems and we had our own evils.
[01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:56.919]  But today we're really facing the ultimate threat.
[01:16:58.002 --> 01:17:00.184]  Here with civilization.
[01:17:00.184 --> 01:17:01.425]  Here with society.
[01:17:01.425 --> 01:17:03.667]  Really, really in a big, big, big way.
[01:17:03.667 --> 01:17:05.248]  Hey guys, my earpiece came unclipped.
[01:17:05.248 --> 01:17:07.169]  It's driving me crazy.
[01:17:07.169 --> 01:17:08.350]  Will somebody come?
[01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:10.151]  Maybe this is a new earpiece.
[01:17:10.151 --> 01:17:12.073]  It's just so long and it's super annoying.
[01:17:12.073 --> 01:17:16.656]  I've never seen a talk show host that's got like a two foot long earpiece.
[01:17:16.656 --> 01:17:18.318]  I know you guys love this earpiece and everything.
[01:17:18.318 --> 01:17:20.339]  You told me this is the earpiece I ought to use.
[01:17:20.339 --> 01:17:23.301]  But it's just driving me absolutely insane.
[01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:26.444]  But let's go ahead and roll that video of the Commander-in-Chief Biden
[01:17:27.963 --> 01:17:31.586]  What's the audio, please?
[01:17:31.586 --> 01:17:32.307]  Thanks.
[01:17:32.307 --> 01:17:32.927]  There you go.
[01:17:32.927 --> 01:17:38.211]  And he's just kind of stumbling along there towards the aircraft.
[01:17:38.211 --> 01:17:40.632]  And he looks like he's having trouble walking right there.
[01:17:40.632 --> 01:17:44.455]  He's got his little Virtue signaling face diaper on.
[01:17:44.455 --> 01:17:47.717]  And doesn't seem to know what planet he's on.
[01:17:47.717 --> 01:17:50.279]  And then as he goes up, he falls down twice.
[01:17:50.279 --> 01:17:52.601]  And he is losing weight extremely fast.
[01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:53.702]  No amount of amphetamines.
[01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:55.303]  No amount of blood transfusions.
[01:17:56.690 --> 01:18:00.251]  We're going to put the Crypt Keeper back together again.
[01:18:00.251 --> 01:18:03.832]  They all salute the guy that couldn't even get a crowd of 100 people at his event.
[01:18:03.832 --> 01:18:05.613]  He stole the election from Trump.
[01:18:05.613 --> 01:18:11.555]  He's got military surrounding, everything, and he falls down three times.
[01:18:11.555 --> 01:18:12.315]  Three times.
[01:18:12.315 --> 01:18:14.996]  Can't even get back up.
[01:18:14.996 --> 01:18:18.838]  And then does his little ginger, I'm a cool lawyer thing.
[01:18:18.838 --> 01:18:21.659]  And then turns around and salutes everyone.
[01:18:21.659 --> 01:18:23.819]  So, you know what Joe Biden really is?
[01:18:23.819 --> 01:18:25.260]  Is he is the gravestone
[01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:33.099]  The gravestone that marks the end of America.
[01:18:33.099 --> 01:18:34.619]  That's really what he is.
[01:18:34.619 --> 01:18:38.322]  America born July 4, 1776.
[01:18:38.322 --> 01:18:41.224]  Died January 20, 2021.
[01:18:41.224 --> 01:18:44.526]  And I don't say that with any relish.
[01:18:44.526 --> 01:18:45.946]  I don't say that with enjoyment.
[01:18:45.946 --> 01:18:48.608]  We have to admit the country is gone.
[01:18:48.608 --> 01:18:50.489]  And I'm going to cover that more after I take your calls.
[01:18:50.489 --> 01:18:56.393]  But China, again, just humiliated us in Alaska in a face-to-face with the administration.
[01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:19.907]  Putin just humiliated us because you've got this empty suit that can't even talk that's shooting his mouth off and saying we're about to punish Russia with serious warlike rhetoric and the average leftist is oblivious because they believe they can suspend the rules of the universe.
[01:19:19.907 --> 01:19:26.771]  They believe they can suspend common sense and justice and all of this and just
[01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:32.967]  This is what happens with these corporate heads that have been having everybody do what they say for decades.
[01:19:32.967 --> 01:19:35.609]  Remember the Deepwater Horizon.
[01:19:35.609 --> 01:19:39.370]  And this is one of the most important things I've ever said.
[01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:42.532]  Remember the Deepwater Horizon.
[01:19:42.532 --> 01:19:46.573]  And Kurt Russell did a great job.
[01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:51.696]  The point is, is that they made a movie out of it.
[01:19:51.696 --> 01:19:54.197]  And it's based off the court filings
[01:19:55.114 --> 01:19:56.414]  And the court hearings.
[01:19:56.414 --> 01:20:01.095]  And so I knew that when I saw the movie.
[01:20:01.095 --> 01:20:06.136]  I later learned that on the DVD, they actually had hours of the actual court testimony.
[01:20:06.136 --> 01:20:11.077]  And I actually watched the court testimony that I guess came out years after they had the trial.
[01:20:11.077 --> 01:20:22.979]  And they knew, the engineers knew that when they stopped dumping concrete into the super deep gas well, that it would cause a blowout and a huge explosion.
[01:20:22.979 --> 01:20:24.379]  But the executives in London
[01:20:25.313 --> 01:20:30.656]  Told the executives in DC, you're spending $25 million a day putting concrete in there.
[01:20:30.656 --> 01:20:33.397]  They had dozens of ships a day delivering the concrete.
[01:20:33.397 --> 01:20:35.658]  They said, we're a huge, rich company.
[01:20:35.658 --> 01:20:37.899]  We just say don't put concrete in.
[01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:44.662]  And the mathematicians, the engineers said, it will blow up.
[01:20:44.662 --> 01:20:48.884]  And they said, we say you're wrong.
[01:20:48.884 --> 01:20:52.246]  And they follow the order.
[01:20:54.562 --> 01:20:58.223]  And they stopped dumping the concrete in.
[01:20:58.223 --> 01:21:02.904]  And then another high-level manager got there, but he still wasn't an executive, another engineer, and said, I don't care.
[01:21:02.904 --> 01:21:04.045]  My job's on the line.
[01:21:04.045 --> 01:21:06.265]  We're not doing this.
[01:21:06.265 --> 01:21:07.445]  Stopped it.
[01:21:07.445 --> 01:21:09.926]  Stopped the drilling until they were going to put more concrete in.
[01:21:09.926 --> 01:21:10.886]  They said, well, you know what?
[01:21:10.886 --> 01:21:14.807]  We're just going to do the pressure test now.
[01:21:14.807 --> 01:21:16.608]  Ordered the pressure test, and it blew up.
[01:21:16.608 --> 01:21:17.788]  You know what happened.
[01:21:17.788 --> 01:21:18.709]  And it's the same thing.
[01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:20.169]  Gates just did this.
[01:21:21.351 --> 01:21:26.897]  They couldn't get any government to approve the mRNA gene editing, which of course is a big deal.
[01:21:26.897 --> 01:21:36.087]  I mean, if they could really figure out how to go in and edit your genes and end cancer and do all this, it'll be the biggest thing since ever.
[01:21:36.087 --> 01:21:38.030]  It'll be bigger than fire, bigger than the wheel.
[01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:40.973]  This is playing God.
[01:21:40.973 --> 01:21:41.874]  This is lightning in a bottle.
[01:21:42.441 --> 01:21:47.086]  But they want to test it all on us, and it's extremely dangerous.
[01:21:47.086 --> 01:21:49.928]  And so they're now testing on billions of people.
[01:21:49.928 --> 01:21:51.390]  16% of the U.S.
[01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:53.692]  population is vaccinated.
[01:21:53.692 --> 01:22:06.765]  I was reading the other day, they think over a billion people now worldwide have been vaccinated with a system that manipulates your DNA, and all the scientists admit it's super dangerous, and you spin the wheel, the weird stuff it can do, and it's already causing mass death.
[01:22:08.214 --> 01:22:09.695]  And it's the same thing.
[01:22:09.695 --> 01:22:14.799]  It's one thing to watch a movie where they actually use testimony and transcripts of what was said.
[01:22:14.799 --> 01:22:32.732]  But when I watched on the DVD hours of the actual hearings where they had the executives admitting, we don't know, we just thought the engineers were wrong, so we just said we'll save $27 million a day and not put concrete in the hole.
[01:22:32.732 --> 01:22:34.353]  And they're asking him, did you know it would blow up?
[01:22:34.353 --> 01:22:35.674]  They're like, no, we just thought it wouldn't.
[01:22:39.651 --> 01:22:41.453]  It's like Chernobyl.
[01:22:41.453 --> 01:22:44.215]  It later came out that the Communist Party showed up.
[01:22:44.215 --> 01:22:46.377]  They said, you're not running this thing at full capacity.
[01:22:46.377 --> 01:22:48.198]  We're having power outages in the area.
[01:22:48.198 --> 01:22:50.020]  They said, listen, this reactor's got major problems.
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:51.941]  It needs to be fixed.
[01:22:51.941 --> 01:22:55.664]  And you cannot run these power tests at full power.
[01:22:55.664 --> 01:22:58.987]  There's a chance that it'll bring the reactor offline.
[01:22:58.987 --> 01:22:59.848]  Well, it didn't do that.
[01:22:59.848 --> 01:23:00.929]  It blew the damn thing up.
[01:23:01.784 --> 01:23:02.984]  So, let me explain again.
[01:23:02.984 --> 01:23:12.887]  You get people that aren't engineers, telling the engineers to do something they tell them is dangerous, and it didn't just take it offline, it blew up when they did it.
[01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:13.827]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:23:13.827 --> 01:23:23.530]  The engineers told them, this is going to blow up, and the bankers went, we're bankers, we're God, just do it.
[01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:25.831]  And so that's what I'm telling you, that's why I'm so concerned.
[01:23:25.831 --> 01:23:29.612]  Bill Gates and these guys have done something a billion times worse than
[01:23:31.394 --> 01:23:39.000]  The Deepwater Horizon and the BP's oil explosion, oil and gas explosion.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:47.327]  They have jumped the shark at a level never before even imagined, and the death is insane.
[01:23:47.327 --> 01:23:49.769]  I know people that are dead from the shot.
[01:23:49.769 --> 01:23:53.792]  This office, everyone here knows people that got deathly ill or died.
[01:23:53.792 --> 01:23:57.175]  I'm going to open the phones up, the next segment, and you'll hear other people call in.
[01:23:58.849 --> 01:24:04.713]  And we're just sitting here watching this, while these crazy people do this.
[01:24:04.713 --> 01:24:11.037]  It's like the FBI director going, there's no Antifa at the Capitol, even though they arrested a bunch of them.
[01:24:11.037 --> 01:24:19.883]  Or it's like, Pelosi came out again, and the Democrats came out again, and a bunch of them came out again, and said, there is no such thing as Antifa.
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:25.061]  I mean, they're just constant.
[01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:25.681]  Who was it?
[01:24:25.681 --> 01:24:26.662]  So many of them.
[01:24:26.662 --> 01:24:30.003]  Who was the Democrat yesterday said there's no such thing as Antifa?
[01:24:30.003 --> 01:24:31.944]  I forget who it was now.
[01:24:31.944 --> 01:24:32.705]  It wasn't Nadler.
[01:24:32.705 --> 01:24:34.146]  He said that last year.
[01:24:34.146 --> 01:24:42.850]  But after everything we've seen and cities burning with Antifa leading it, another major Democrat came out and said it's a myth.
[01:24:42.850 --> 01:24:44.631]  I wanted to play the clip yesterday and we never got to it.
[01:24:44.631 --> 01:24:47.553]  Who was it?
[01:24:47.553 --> 01:24:48.313]  Yeah, it was okay.
[01:24:48.313 --> 01:24:49.654]  It was it was it was Joy Behar.
[01:24:49.654 --> 01:24:50.734]  That's right.
[01:24:50.734 --> 01:24:51.455]  I mean, wow.
[01:24:52.446 --> 01:24:53.267]  This is just crazy.
[01:24:53.267 --> 01:24:53.787]  We'll be right back.
[01:24:53.787 --> 01:24:54.327]  I'll give the number out.
[01:24:54.327 --> 01:24:55.568]  Stay with us.
[01:24:55.568 --> 01:25:03.674]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[01:25:03.674 --> 01:25:09.719]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[01:25:09.719 --> 01:25:18.586]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension, so we can decide where we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to.
[01:25:18.586 --> 01:25:19.827]  And it really does come down to that.
[01:25:21.048 --> 01:25:28.434]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[01:25:28.434 --> 01:25:32.057]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[01:25:32.057 --> 01:25:35.800]  God is the author of us having free will, and that free will
[01:25:36.736 --> 01:25:37.697]  Is a beautiful thing.
[01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:42.581]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood, this whole evil culture in Washington, D.C.
[01:25:42.581 --> 01:25:47.645]  and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[01:25:47.645 --> 01:25:50.488]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're bad.
[01:25:50.488 --> 01:25:55.592]  Because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[01:25:55.592 --> 01:25:57.654]  I knew Trump was embattled.
[01:25:57.654 --> 01:26:03.759]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.661]  I don't believe it.
[01:26:07.661 --> 01:26:11.125]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:14.588]  And I understand why people learn to believe that, because this is scary what's going on.
[01:26:14.588 --> 01:26:20.234]  The global government, the new world order, and now the people holding up the fact that that's real, they want somebody to come save them from.
[01:26:20.234 --> 01:26:22.196]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[01:26:22.196 --> 01:26:28.282]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[01:26:29.082 --> 01:26:30.303]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[01:26:30.303 --> 01:26:36.965]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed, and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain.
[01:26:36.965 --> 01:26:38.226]  Energy costs, everything else.
[01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:49.451]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate, where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[01:26:49.451 --> 01:26:50.871]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[01:26:50.871 --> 01:26:52.852]  The swamp is deep.
[01:26:52.852 --> 01:26:54.633]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[01:26:55.965 --> 01:27:04.157]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:10.194]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[01:27:29.779 --> 01:27:32.541]  And no unwanted additives.
[01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:33.222]  Yes.
[01:27:33.222 --> 01:27:38.126]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.

[01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:46.113]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:27:46.113 --> 01:27:47.974]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[01:27:47.974 --> 01:27:50.797]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:27:50.797 --> 01:27:54.299]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:27:57.987 --> 01:28:06.791]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:06.791 --> 01:28:20.917]  The globalists didn't tell us for the last hundred years they were going to establish world government and carry out the orderly depopulation of the planet for no reason.
[01:28:20.917 --> 01:28:26.279]  They didn't prepare all these systems and produce thousands of movies promoting it or thousands of books because they were
[01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.955]  Playing tiddlywinks.
[01:28:28.955 --> 01:28:33.458]  They mean business, and they mean to take full control of human civilization.
[01:28:33.458 --> 01:28:36.160]  They're not in full control yet, but they're getting damn close.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.981]  A lot of people say, well, I'll just submit and go along with them.
[01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:39.241]  Really?
[01:28:39.241 --> 01:28:45.585]  It's like the James Bond movie where they got him strapped down about to kill him with a laser.
[01:28:45.585 --> 01:28:48.487]  And he says, you expect me to talk?
[01:28:48.487 --> 01:28:51.649]  And he says, no, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:58.011]  And so everybody can play along like you're part of the system.
[01:28:58.011 --> 01:29:00.652]  You're not.
[01:29:00.652 --> 01:29:09.416]  I just love how I told people about world government decades ago and how it was all being set up for medical tyranny to use a virus for a lockdown to build a post-human society.
[01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:13.138]  And I had the documents then and people didn't want to believe me.
[01:29:13.138 --> 01:29:21.542]  And now they don't even give me credit for having the documents.
[01:29:21.542 --> 01:29:24.564]  They think I'm like a prophet.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.503]  I have sat there with senators and former heads of U.S.
[01:29:30.503 --> 01:29:39.350]  intelligence agencies and billionaires and you name it, and they literally go, how did you know all this?
[01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:40.791]  How did you predict it?
[01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:43.213]  How did you know they do lockdowns and use a virus?
[01:29:43.213 --> 01:29:44.174]  And they're just like, wow.
[01:29:44.174 --> 01:29:47.176]  And I'm like, it's in the damn documents.
[01:29:47.176 --> 01:29:51.600]  Now, granted, there's a lot of documents, but there's key documents and there's all the rest of the BS.
[01:29:52.205 --> 01:30:01.769]  Like, I'm getting a lot of calls and a lot of texts and I'm seeing people say, Jones, why haven't you talked about this incel that went and shot the eight people in Atlanta?
[01:30:01.769 --> 01:30:10.473]  Well, I mean, day one when I saw it was Jack Shacks, massage parlors, sex shops.
[01:30:10.473 --> 01:30:16.376]  I was like, it's probably some gang war or it's some incel.
[01:30:16.376 --> 01:30:20.197]  And once I saw the suspect, I go, my God, he looks like all the mass shooters.
[01:30:20.197 --> 01:30:20.858]  He's an incel.
[01:30:20.858 --> 01:30:21.438]  He hates women.
[01:30:22.344 --> 01:30:26.967]  Now he's an incel that at least went and got, you know, service or whatever.
[01:30:26.967 --> 01:30:30.650]  And I'm not the sex trade, but I'm just saying he at least went out and was doing something.
[01:30:30.650 --> 01:30:36.754]  But then he got mad that he was spending all his money on this.
[01:30:36.754 --> 01:30:38.355]  And so then he went and killed the women.
[01:30:38.355 --> 01:30:40.537]  That's not because they were Asian.
[01:30:40.537 --> 01:30:45.940]  You know, that's like Jack the Ripper was reportedly the crown prince.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.762]  And he was mad at the hookers.
[01:30:47.762 --> 01:30:49.323]  So he went and killed a bunch of them.
[01:30:49.323 --> 01:30:51.004]  That was a white dude killing white women.
[01:30:51.809 --> 01:31:03.778]  You know, John's killing hookers is as old as the world, and it's wrong, and it's disgusting, and it's cowardly.
[01:31:03.778 --> 01:31:04.598]  But that's what happened.
[01:31:04.598 --> 01:31:09.922]  Instead, it's like, oh, there's a war on Asians!
[01:31:09.922 --> 01:31:16.427]  Well, look, I don't want to get into racial statistics, because I love everybody, but let's talk about who's attacking the Asians.
[01:31:17.242 --> 01:31:39.694]  Because the Asians come in and build businesses and things in poor black areas, and resentment builds up, a lot of it unfounded, some of it founded, only because I have grew up in Dallas, and I love Asian folks too, I'm just saying some of the Asians in the places are rude, and the fights get started, and a lot of enmity begins, and people robbing the shops, and then everybody is treated bad, and then it turns into a fight.
[01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:45.497]  I mean, my goodness, I mean, the black folks are killing each other in those neighborhoods, so the fact they start killing the Asians, I mean, that's just what's going on.
[01:31:46.716 --> 01:31:49.297]  And it's a problem.
[01:31:49.297 --> 01:31:55.318]  But the media trying to turn this around and say there's an epidemic of white supremacists killing Asians.
[01:31:55.318 --> 01:32:00.720]  There was a video on CNN this morning of a homeless guy that tried to reportedly rob an Asian lady.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.701]  And so she hit him, he hit them.
[01:32:02.701 --> 01:32:04.241]  And it was like, top story!
[01:32:04.241 --> 01:32:06.222]  White supremacist attacks old woman.
[01:32:06.222 --> 01:32:09.803]  It turns out he's a homeless mental patient.
[01:32:09.803 --> 01:32:14.464]  You know, a white homeless person in Seattle bit my cousin.
[01:32:19.178 --> 01:32:26.946]  Who I was such good friends with, Jeffrey, I won't say his last name.
[01:32:26.946 --> 01:32:41.882]  And he went to give one homeless guy a 20, and the other homeless guy was so mad, bit his hand, he almost had to have his arm removed, and the infection ate his liver, and he died six months later from the homeless person that bit him.
[01:32:43.214 --> 01:32:44.715]  I was a white dude, been a white dude.
[01:32:44.715 --> 01:32:55.125]  So yes, a literal, rabid, homeless person in Seattle killed my cousin, who worked for Microsoft.
[01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:57.787]  I was making a million dollars a year, but he's dead now.
[01:32:57.787 --> 01:33:00.770]  So, that's how all of this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:02.006 --> 01:33:03.186]  And that's the reality here.
[01:33:03.186 --> 01:33:05.067]  So, any chance they can.
[01:33:05.067 --> 01:33:06.187]  Oh my God!
[01:33:06.187 --> 01:33:08.548]  The white people are killing Asians.
[01:33:08.548 --> 01:33:10.148]  Let's pull up FBI crime statistics.
[01:33:10.148 --> 01:33:11.129]  They try to suppress these.
[01:33:11.129 --> 01:33:13.529]  Pull up white on Asian crime statistics.
[01:33:13.529 --> 01:33:17.131]  It basically doesn't exist.
[01:33:17.131 --> 01:33:21.912]  But there is an epidemic of black on Asian crime.
[01:33:21.912 --> 01:33:23.652]  And so the media has to cover that up.
[01:33:23.652 --> 01:33:26.113]  So they turn it into white on Asian crime.
[01:33:26.113 --> 01:33:28.494]  And out of 350 million people, an incel
[01:33:29.457 --> 01:33:32.319]  Didn't go up and shoot up the high school because the girls didn't want him.
[01:33:32.319 --> 01:33:35.762]  Didn't go shoot up the college because the girls didn't want him.
[01:33:35.762 --> 01:33:40.205]  He went and shot up the women that were sex workers.
[01:33:40.205 --> 01:33:43.347]  And of course, the media doesn't make an issue about sex workers.
[01:33:43.347 --> 01:33:45.189]  But let me give you a little news flash.
[01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:47.110]  I've never done it, but I know a lot of people have.
[01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:49.652]  You know, you saw the owner of the Patriots got in trouble for it.
[01:33:49.652 --> 01:33:51.754]  Do you know what those massage parlors are?
[01:33:51.754 --> 01:33:57.618]  Do you know what the lingerie modeling places are?
[01:33:57.618 --> 01:33:58.679]  Those are whorehouses.
[01:34:00.450 --> 01:34:01.371]  Yeah.
[01:34:01.371 --> 01:34:04.353]  And you go in there and you pay them a hundred bucks, they do this.
[01:34:04.353 --> 01:34:06.234]  You pay them three hundred bucks, they do that.
[01:34:06.234 --> 01:34:09.036]  That's what goes on at those places.
[01:34:09.036 --> 01:34:11.257]  Okay?
[01:34:11.257 --> 01:34:16.080]  I know a lot of famous people that are totally addicted to it and, like, do it three times a day.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:23.785]  Like, I know a very famous person who's really cool, but I can't hang out with him because that's all he wants to do is go to Jack Shacks.
[01:34:23.785 --> 01:34:27.508]  And I'm not going to sit there eating a hamburger in the car while he's in a Jack Shack for 20 minutes.
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:30.201]  So, that's what they are, folks.
[01:34:30.201 --> 01:34:33.182]  They're called Jack Shacks.
[01:34:33.182 --> 01:34:35.623]  And you, pull up the incel that killed these women.
[01:34:35.623 --> 01:34:37.704]  I hope they execute his little ass.
[01:34:37.704 --> 01:34:41.025]  I hope they haul him up with piano wire.
[01:34:41.025 --> 01:34:44.807]  You're the little pervert, look at him!
[01:34:44.807 --> 01:34:53.650]  You're the little pervert, and your body armor and all the rest of it's a little commando that's mad at the women that you pay to service you.
[01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:55.551]  You're a pathetic maggot.
[01:34:57.341 --> 01:35:01.904]  But I will not turn in my guns because you did this.
[01:35:01.904 --> 01:35:08.569]  And the answer is, ladies, if you're running a whorehouse, you need to have a gunman there.
[01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:10.591]  But that's another thing about the Jack Shacks.
[01:35:10.591 --> 01:35:11.351]  They don't have pimps.
[01:35:11.351 --> 01:35:14.614]  They're run by women.
[01:35:14.614 --> 01:35:17.976]  And again, I'm not an officiato, but I study everything.
[01:35:17.976 --> 01:35:20.258]  I am an officiato of crime.
[01:35:20.258 --> 01:35:21.279]  It's what I look into.
[01:35:21.279 --> 01:35:23.460]  And I've asked people to go to these things.
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:23.921]  They're all over.
[01:35:23.921 --> 01:35:25.622]  You can't swing a stick in Austin and not hit one.
[01:35:26.403 --> 01:35:27.764]  Yeah, the cars are all in the parking lot.
[01:35:27.764 --> 01:35:29.566]  I'm like, are there pimps there?
[01:35:29.566 --> 01:35:31.888]  No, there's no pimps.
[01:35:31.888 --> 01:35:33.729]  It's run by the women.
[01:35:33.729 --> 01:35:35.531]  There's usually a cop car down the street.
[01:35:35.531 --> 01:35:38.053]  Well, let me tell you who runs the Jack Shacks.
[01:35:38.053 --> 01:35:41.395]  I mean, they busted a bunch of Austin captains years ago running them.
[01:35:41.395 --> 01:35:43.377]  They were running like seven or eight of them here in town.
[01:35:43.377 --> 01:35:44.738]  The police run the Jack Shacks.
[01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:47.220]  I mean, they get a little cut, I guess.
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.182]  They get a little taste of the Jack Shack.
[01:35:49.182 --> 01:35:54.086]  But anyways, you've now gotten a little lore here on air about Jack Shacks, and I'm going to stop at that point.
[01:35:56.283 --> 01:35:58.084]  Let's get into serious issues now.
[01:35:58.084 --> 01:36:00.304]  Not Biden falling on his face, not any of that.
[01:36:00.304 --> 01:36:02.785]  I want to take an hour of your calls.
[01:36:02.785 --> 01:36:06.626]  For first-time callers, your story about the vaccine.
[01:36:06.626 --> 01:36:07.206]  Did you take it?
[01:36:07.206 --> 01:36:08.486]  Did you love it?
[01:36:08.486 --> 01:36:09.727]  What happened to your loved ones?
[01:36:09.727 --> 01:36:10.487]  Was it wonderful?
[01:36:10.487 --> 01:36:11.827]  Was it terrible?
[01:36:11.827 --> 01:36:13.068]  Did your loved ones get sick?
[01:36:13.068 --> 01:36:16.829]  Did your loved ones sprout wings like a butterfly and fly around the room?
[01:36:16.829 --> 01:36:20.630]  All we got was negative hell yesterday, and every other show does just the same thing.
[01:36:20.630 --> 01:36:25.611]  And this is what Big Tech doesn't want anyone else to know.
[01:36:28.655 --> 01:36:35.261]  They are fighting around the clock to suppress this, but the evidence is all coming out and they can't hide it, and they've got liability protection.
[01:36:35.261 --> 01:36:47.113]  They don't have liability protection from racketeering and their attempts to suppress people doing consumer reviews, or talking about what's happened to them, or talking about what has unfolded.
[01:36:47.113 --> 01:36:48.354]  So the total free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:36:53.726 --> 01:36:54.566]  877-789-ALEX?
[01:36:54.566 --> 01:36:57.068]  877-789-2539?
[01:36:57.068 --> 01:37:00.730]  I know it's hard to talk about your family member that went into convulsions.
[01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:03.032]  It's hard to talk about what happened to you when you took it.
[01:37:03.032 --> 01:37:05.393]  It's hard to talk about your father that died, or your mother.
[01:37:05.393 --> 01:37:08.415]  But we got the calls, and they were bone-chilling.
[01:37:08.415 --> 01:37:12.858]  And those videos are on Bandot Video, and they're going viral.
[01:37:12.858 --> 01:37:17.681]  Three or four videos from yesterday already have 200,000 to 400,000 views.
[01:37:17.681 --> 01:37:19.602]  And people are waking up.
[01:37:19.602 --> 01:37:21.163]  So, we gotta save people.
[01:37:22.751 --> 01:37:24.412]  We got to save people.
[01:37:24.412 --> 01:37:25.333]  We got to warn people.
[01:37:25.333 --> 01:37:30.656]  We have a responsibility to do this, especially because they're going to push and push and push and make it mandatory by next year.
[01:37:30.656 --> 01:37:31.476]  That's the goal.
[01:37:31.476 --> 01:37:43.843]  Once they get the sheeple inoculated, they're going to go, oh, people are still sick, not because the vaccine's causing illnesses, not because the vaccine's caused mutations, but because you haven't taken your inoculation.
[01:37:43.843 --> 01:37:45.564]  So we've got to fight this now.
[01:37:45.564 --> 01:37:48.686]  We've got to fight it now before the next phase is going to place.
[01:37:48.686 --> 01:37:51.427]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:37:51.427 --> 01:37:52.248]  Tomorrow's news today.

[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:58.902]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[01:38:59.517 --> 01:39:02.778]  But world government is only the control grid.
[01:39:02.778 --> 01:39:10.321]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality.
[01:39:10.321 --> 01:39:17.344]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based life forms.
[01:39:17.344 --> 01:39:19.585]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[01:39:19.585 --> 01:39:23.326]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[01:39:23.326 --> 01:39:24.527]  They are playing God.
[01:39:25.187 --> 01:39:35.049]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[01:39:35.049 --> 01:39:40.370]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the Globalist, it's all on record.
[01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:42.790]  You have been warned.
[01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:47.251]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[01:39:47.251 --> 01:39:50.832]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[01:39:50.832 --> 01:39:53.292]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[01:39:54.887 --> 01:39:58.831]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[01:39:58.831 --> 01:40:01.453]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodines?
[01:40:01.453 --> 01:40:02.214]  Why do you do that?
[01:40:02.214 --> 01:40:05.156]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[01:40:05.156 --> 01:40:16.106]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:17.004]  Boom.
[01:40:17.004 --> 01:40:17.385]  We did it.
[01:40:17.385 --> 01:40:17.905]  It's popular.
[01:40:17.905 --> 01:40:18.665]  It's X3.
[01:40:18.665 --> 01:40:19.926]  Is it better than X2?
[01:40:19.926 --> 01:40:20.567]  You decide.
[01:40:20.567 --> 01:40:22.048]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[01:40:22.048 --> 01:40:27.812]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid.
[01:40:27.812 --> 01:40:29.233]  And that is down and out.
[01:40:29.233 --> 01:40:30.494]  It's super strong.
[01:40:30.494 --> 01:40:30.754]  Waste
[01:40:33.917 --> 01:40:35.799]  Different strokes for different folks.
[01:40:35.799 --> 01:40:36.599]  Different formulas.

[01:40:55.198 --> 01:40:56.739]  The people are awakening.
[01:40:56.739 --> 01:40:59.459]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[01:40:59.459 --> 01:41:01.520]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:03.861]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[01:41:03.861 --> 01:41:17.665]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai comms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data.
[01:41:17.665 --> 01:41:21.606]  They can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[01:41:22.126 --> 01:41:28.812]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[01:41:28.812 --> 01:41:30.234]  In their own words, they admit it.
[01:41:30.234 --> 01:41:35.158]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[01:41:35.158 --> 01:41:37.100]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:38.181]  They're Faraday cages.
[01:41:38.181 --> 01:41:39.902]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[01:41:39.902 --> 01:41:41.424]  They work absolutely great.
[01:41:41.804 --> 01:41:42.765]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:42:20.919 --> 01:42:22.440]  Thank you for caring, folks.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.601]  Thank you for being in the game.
[01:42:23.601 --> 01:42:26.122]  Thank you for not being a spectator.
[01:42:26.122 --> 01:42:27.823]  Thank you for tuning in.
[01:42:27.823 --> 01:42:29.104]  Because we're not going to mince words.
[01:42:29.104 --> 01:42:30.905]  We're not going to pull punches here.
[01:42:30.905 --> 01:42:35.048]  I'm almost, not almost, I'm frightened to take these calls.
[01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:41.152]  When we had, what, three people call in whose family members died after they took the shots?
[01:42:41.152 --> 01:42:42.252]  I'd love to hear a bunch of calls.
[01:42:42.252 --> 01:42:44.534]  Everything went well.
[01:42:44.534 --> 01:42:45.014]  Didn't happen.
[01:42:46.594 --> 01:42:47.795]  And I'm looking at the news here, man.
[01:42:47.795 --> 01:42:49.616]  I mean, there are so many deaths now.
[01:42:49.616 --> 01:42:52.337]  They admit thousands of deaths from the vaccine in the U.S.
[01:42:52.337 --> 01:42:55.839]  They're like, well, that's a good price to pay.
[01:42:55.839 --> 01:43:04.663]  And the EU government goes, well, we've had a lot of deaths and a lot of problems, but it's overall, the risks are outweighed by the benefit.
[01:43:04.663 --> 01:43:09.986]  But then separately, if you criticize the death, big tech goes, there are no deaths!
[01:43:09.986 --> 01:43:12.547]  You're banned off Twitter and Facebook.
[01:43:12.547 --> 01:43:14.308]  And that makes me really angry.
[01:43:15.493 --> 01:43:30.809]  At Big Tech, really angry at Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai.
[01:43:30.809 --> 01:43:35.274]  What's really weird is, I'm not gonna even go there.
[01:43:35.274 --> 01:43:36.836]  Let's just say this, these guys aren't in charge.
[01:43:38.152 --> 01:43:44.775]  And Jack Dorsey and others have directly told a very, very famous person I know, oh, we love Alex.
[01:43:44.775 --> 01:43:45.935]  He's good.
[01:43:45.935 --> 01:43:50.297]  Let him know we're really on his side.
[01:43:50.297 --> 01:43:55.219]  You know, the first time I got that message from Mark Zuckerberg, I didn't believe it.
[01:43:55.219 --> 01:43:57.099]  I'm like, Mark's going to show you.
[01:43:57.099 --> 01:44:02.462]  Go ahead and do your first Facebook mentions and see what happens.
[01:44:02.462 --> 01:44:04.943]  And it got like 20 million views.
[01:44:04.943 --> 01:44:05.943]  They did that, folks.
[01:44:07.347 --> 01:44:11.329]  And then like a month later, well, you're not being very nice to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:44:11.329 --> 01:44:13.670]  And imagine everybody else just takes it.
[01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:15.150]  That's money.
[01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:18.111]  That's like counterfeit money.
[01:44:18.111 --> 01:44:22.813]  To just give somebody, let people have access to their viewers and let them have 20 million views.
[01:44:22.813 --> 01:44:27.155]  I mean, yeah, people clicked on it, but they rigged that.
[01:44:27.155 --> 01:44:30.436]  But what's crazy is they try to force feed Joe Biden.
[01:44:30.436 --> 01:44:32.417]  He had 1,000 people watch him last night.
[01:44:33.914 --> 01:44:37.355]  So what I'm getting at here is they don't want this information on air.
[01:44:37.355 --> 01:44:39.957]  They hate you having a chance to call in.
[01:44:39.957 --> 01:44:41.157]  I love you having a chance.
[01:44:41.157 --> 01:44:43.618]  I'm very honored you're calling in.
[01:44:43.618 --> 01:44:46.979]  Jason and Christopher and Jason and Henry and Julie and Jason.
[01:44:46.979 --> 01:44:48.480]  I've got a lot of Jasons today.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:52.802]  And Andrew?
[01:44:52.802 --> 01:44:59.224]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Jason in Missouri.
[01:44:59.224 --> 01:45:00.165]  Jason, thanks for calling.
[01:45:00.165 --> 01:45:00.465]  Go ahead.
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:02.680]  Hi, Alex.
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:03.321]  Long time listener.
[01:45:03.321 --> 01:45:04.501]  First time caller, man.
[01:45:04.501 --> 01:45:11.324]  I've got a... My business partner, his father-in-law took the Pfizer vaccine.
[01:45:11.324 --> 01:45:12.425]  He was in good health.
[01:45:12.425 --> 01:45:12.765]  Mid-70s.
[01:45:12.765 --> 01:45:14.166]  Vietnam vet.
[01:45:14.166 --> 01:45:18.028]  Took the Pfizer vaccine within a week.
[01:45:19.978 --> 01:45:23.999]  He was, uh, got to the point where he couldn't hardly walk, couldn't hardly move.
[01:45:23.999 --> 01:45:32.962]  Um, went to the hospital and within about 60 hours, or about 60 hours after that, he was, uh, he's dead.
[01:45:32.962 --> 01:45:34.243]  Well, that's exactly what happens.
[01:45:34.243 --> 01:45:35.263]  That happened to my, uh...
[01:45:36.152 --> 01:45:44.484]  Brother-in-law's father, who's a medical doctor, on the second shot he became basically paralyzed, could barely get up or move, arms and legs paralyzed for several days.
[01:45:44.484 --> 01:45:47.368]  He came out of it, that's Guillain-Barré.
[01:45:47.368 --> 01:45:49.732]  What effect has this had on the people that watch this happen?
[01:45:51.673 --> 01:45:55.596]  They're to the point, they were asleep before I've tried and tried to wake them up.
[01:45:55.596 --> 01:45:56.857]  It's a constant battle in my house.
[01:45:56.857 --> 01:46:03.823]  My wife is a nurse practitioner, so obviously it's a constant battle between us and them.
[01:46:03.823 --> 01:46:05.003]  But they're waking up now.
[01:46:05.003 --> 01:46:06.405]  They're starting to listen to InfoWars.
[01:46:06.405 --> 01:46:09.767]  I've been telling them, you know, you need to look at all this information.
[01:46:09.767 --> 01:46:12.229]  They started following Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[01:46:14.042 --> 01:46:18.187]  And really starting doing their own research and they're like, no, nobody in our family is going to do this.
[01:46:18.187 --> 01:46:19.728]  And I warned them as well.
[01:46:19.728 --> 01:46:22.331]  The VA is piggybacking shots.
[01:46:22.331 --> 01:46:29.539]  So if they get to that point, I had, you had a caller yesterday talking about how her dad was threatened with losing his military or his VA care.
[01:46:29.539 --> 01:46:31.201]  I went, I'm a contractor.
[01:46:31.201 --> 01:46:32.042]  I went like an idiot.
[01:46:32.042 --> 01:46:35.946]  I always got my tetanus shot and I went to the VA to get my, the local VA.
[01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:39.272]  And I went to get my tetanus shot.
[01:46:39.272 --> 01:46:44.357]  After I got the shot, I was looking at the little paper they give you, you know, to show what they've done and all that stuff.
[01:46:44.357 --> 01:46:48.321]  And it said on there, MMR with tetanus.
[01:46:48.321 --> 01:46:49.602]  And I was like, I only got one shot.
[01:46:49.602 --> 01:46:50.624]  You've got MMR down here.
[01:46:50.624 --> 01:46:52.405]  She said, no, we piggyback them.
[01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:53.547]  We're starting to mix the shot.
[01:46:53.547 --> 01:46:54.107]  We piggyback.
[01:46:54.107 --> 01:46:56.410]  Oh yeah, that's the one that causes the autism.
[01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:57.531]  You never want to mix them.
[01:46:58.749 --> 01:46:59.270]  Right.
[01:46:59.270 --> 01:47:02.813]  And I went, they escorted me out because I went absolutely insane.
[01:47:02.813 --> 01:47:04.896]  I said, I never did consent to this.
[01:47:04.896 --> 01:47:05.496]  This is wrong.
[01:47:05.496 --> 01:47:06.197]  This is illegal.
[01:47:06.197 --> 01:47:09.120]  You cannot give me an injection without me consenting to it.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:12.524]  But that could be a new avenue that they try to approach with the VA.
[01:47:13.467 --> 01:47:17.691]  With people not wanting to get their shots.
[01:47:17.691 --> 01:47:19.693]  That's right, I agree with you.
[01:47:19.693 --> 01:47:20.434]  Hey, listen.
[01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:32.006]  Trump's gone now, and I hope he can get control of the Republican Party for America first, and I think he's a good guy overall, but he's doubled down on the vaccines, and basically does what Fauci tells him now, when Fauci was one of his biggest enemies.
[01:47:32.006 --> 01:47:33.688]  Is that a disappointment for you, Jason?
[01:47:34.753 --> 01:47:36.674]  It's a huge disappointment.
[01:47:36.674 --> 01:47:39.155]  I've had my front of my house hit with bottles.
[01:47:39.155 --> 01:47:40.956]  I've had all kinds of stuff in my neighborhood.
[01:47:40.956 --> 01:47:44.298]  My neighborhood is turned... We moved into my neighborhood.
[01:47:44.298 --> 01:47:47.080]  Really nice, middle class, upper middle class neighborhood.
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:48.761]  We moved into this place two years ago.
[01:47:48.761 --> 01:47:51.122]  When we moved in, it was very conservative.
[01:47:51.122 --> 01:47:51.602]  All red.
[01:47:51.602 --> 01:47:57.305]  And then all of a sudden, all the license plates that started seeing people moving in was all Chicago.
[01:47:57.305 --> 01:47:59.967]  It was from all Illinois, New York, Michigan, California.
[01:47:59.967 --> 01:48:01.027]  You know, that's what's crazy.
[01:48:01.027 --> 01:48:03.409]  They flee what they've done and bring it with them.
[01:48:03.409 --> 01:48:04.049]  They're so dumb.
[01:48:05.251 --> 01:48:13.961]  I argue with him about all the time and it pisses, sorry, it makes me angry that I've, you know, like you talk about being persecuted for standing up for Trump.
[01:48:13.961 --> 01:48:15.222]  I was a member of the Proud Boys.
[01:48:15.222 --> 01:48:17.024]  I was, I was at all of the rallies.
[01:48:17.024 --> 01:48:19.607]  I was at, I was standing and fighting with Antifa.
[01:48:19.607 --> 01:48:22.070]  I was doing all of this stuff and I was defending Trump.
[01:48:22.995 --> 01:48:27.336]  And then to hear him come out and do this stuff, which, like I said, like you say, I'm not a cult follower.
[01:48:27.336 --> 01:48:29.576]  I don't believe, you know, he's God.
[01:48:29.576 --> 01:48:31.717]  I disagree with a lot of the stuff he did.
[01:48:31.717 --> 01:48:32.557]  A lot of the stuff.
[01:48:32.557 --> 01:48:38.778]  But he was still overall, in the overall picture, he was better for this country than anybody we've ever had in that seat.
[01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:39.258]  I hear you.
[01:48:39.258 --> 01:48:44.019]  Maybe he should come out and fully endorse the vaccine as reverse psychology, and then the Democrats won't take it.
[01:48:44.019 --> 01:48:45.459]  Thank you so much, Jason.
[01:48:45.459 --> 01:48:47.359]  Let's talk to Devin in Texas.
[01:48:47.359 --> 01:48:51.000]  Devin, tell us what you've witnessed with these loving gene therapies.
[01:48:52.063 --> 01:48:55.205]  Oh man, it's terrifying man.
[01:48:55.205 --> 01:49:00.368]  But let me first start off with, I'm a new listener.
[01:49:00.368 --> 01:49:08.533]  I'm so glad that your show's on the air and you know, just having that platform kind of gives me hope for what's actually going on out here.
[01:49:08.533 --> 01:49:16.937]  So I was at work and I get a text message from my grandmother saying that my mom's in the hospital.
[01:49:18.522 --> 01:49:24.444]  And she told me she felt like she was having a heart attack with this vaccine.
[01:49:24.444 --> 01:49:27.245]  I wasn't sure exactly which one she took.
[01:49:27.245 --> 01:49:29.425]  I think it's the Moderna.
[01:49:29.425 --> 01:49:35.667]  But yeah, I just advise people not, do not take this garbage.
[01:49:35.667 --> 01:49:36.987]  Do not take this garbage.
[01:49:36.987 --> 01:49:40.748]  Please, for the love of God, this is not for the people.
[01:49:40.748 --> 01:49:44.750]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:46.390]  I mean, give us more details of what unfolded.
[01:49:47.857 --> 01:49:57.461]  Um, so I, I don't, all I got was over text was that she was having, um, the really, she got like shaking.
[01:49:57.461 --> 01:50:05.785]  She was shaking and, um, she, she's out of the hospital now, but, um, she, she still feels bad.
[01:50:05.785 --> 01:50:08.486]  She's still feeling the after effects.
[01:50:08.486 --> 01:50:11.788]  And, um, was that the first shot or the second shot?
[01:50:11.788 --> 01:50:13.228]  That was the first one.
[01:50:13.228 --> 01:50:14.829]  So let me tell you, this is a life and death.
[01:50:15.544 --> 01:50:24.190]  So many people are in Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness and also normalcy bias that they can't admit they were screwed over.
[01:50:24.190 --> 01:50:33.497]  So if you have a violent reaction to the first shot, I know people that have worked in the State Department, contractors, a lot of people take a lot of shots and they'll tell them if you have a bad reaction to a shot,
[01:50:34.187 --> 01:50:36.949]  Particularly certain types, you can never even take vaccines again, period.
[01:50:36.949 --> 01:50:41.433]  It's like if you've been stung by a bee and have an allergic response, you better carry an EpiPen with you.
[01:50:41.433 --> 01:50:43.535]  Once you have the response, it only gets worse.
[01:50:43.535 --> 01:50:52.483]  The fact that she got sick on the first one, is the second one when you have the real event showing you're quote immune to it, that means it'll probably kill her if she takes it again.
[01:50:52.483 --> 01:50:54.064]  Is she planning to take the second shot?
[01:50:55.263 --> 01:50:56.784]  No, I really hope not.
[01:50:56.784 --> 01:51:03.627]  I've been trying to tell my family this for a month now, and I told them, look, don't get the vaccine, don't take the shot.
[01:51:03.627 --> 01:51:05.028]  Please don't do it.
[01:51:05.028 --> 01:51:06.329]  What did they say once this happened?
[01:51:06.329 --> 01:51:09.590]  Did it wake them up?
[01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:10.911]  I hope so, Alex.
[01:51:10.911 --> 01:51:11.831]  I hope so.
[01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:12.692]  Well, tell them this.
[01:51:12.692 --> 01:51:14.973]  If they're going to go ahead and kill her, take insurance out on her.
[01:51:14.973 --> 01:51:16.373]  I'm not being sarcastic.
[01:51:16.373 --> 01:51:17.414]  It's legalized murder.
[01:51:17.414 --> 01:51:22.096]  You should just take out a lot of insurance on your family member and then just kill their ass with the vaccine.
[01:51:22.096 --> 01:51:22.817]  You'll be protected.
[01:51:22.817 --> 01:51:23.457]  Appreciate you, sir.
[01:51:24.022 --> 01:51:25.923]  And I'm not even being sarcastic.
[01:51:25.923 --> 01:51:26.923]  I am, but I'm not.
[01:51:26.923 --> 01:51:33.587]  I mean, if we're going to just start killing the old people, then all of you ought to go ahead and take out insurance on granddaddy or grandma, because that's who it's killing.
[01:51:33.587 --> 01:51:36.568]  The British government, two months ago, banned giving it to 75 and up.
[01:51:36.568 --> 01:51:37.929]  All right.
[01:51:37.929 --> 01:51:39.209]  I'm going to go to break.
[01:51:39.209 --> 01:51:40.070]  I'm going to start the next time.
[01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:41.350]  I'm going to write back to your calls.
[01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:42.871]  877-789-2539, specifically on this.
[01:51:42.871 --> 01:51:43.031]  Briefly.
[01:51:47.085 --> 01:51:50.750]  We don't have the store-wide free shipping anymore because the storable food and stuff is just too big a cost.
[01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:52.031]  We can't do it and operate.
[01:51:52.031 --> 01:51:57.919]  But we do have it on select best-selling items, free shipping, super mega blowout sale.
[01:51:57.919 --> 01:52:02.785]  All these items except for BrainForce Plus, it just came back in, are selling out.

[01:53:42.002 --> 01:53:42.162]  A 360 win!
[01:53:45.968 --> 01:53:51.131]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations, and different mixes of the two.
[01:53:51.131 --> 01:53:54.173]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[01:53:54.173 --> 01:54:03.238]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos, and a culture, and ingenuity, art, and skill, and strength.
[01:54:03.238 --> 01:54:08.621]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls, with a tiny elite above it.
[01:54:09.602 --> 01:54:17.173]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[01:54:17.173 --> 01:54:21.319]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[01:54:21.319 --> 01:54:25.585]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[01:54:26.145 --> 01:54:28.367]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[01:54:28.367 --> 01:54:31.269]  It's already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[01:54:31.269 --> 01:54:33.451]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[01:54:33.451 --> 01:54:41.297]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[01:54:41.297 --> 01:54:42.098]  That's the facts.
[01:54:42.098 --> 01:54:47.482]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[01:54:47.482 --> 01:54:50.084]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:10.495 --> 01:55:15.156]  All right, I'm looking at the comments by the listeners.
[01:55:15.156 --> 01:55:16.217]  We're not censoring your calls.
[01:55:16.217 --> 01:55:21.398]  We just ask that you give us your name, you want to tell us where you're calling from, and have a clear phone.
[01:55:21.398 --> 01:55:26.759]  And if you want to call, the vaccine worked great for you, and you loved it, we'd love to hear from you.
[01:55:26.759 --> 01:55:31.140]  But instead, I've got mother-in-law took vaccine, seizures, hospitalized.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:34.241]  Brian, father, doctor, took vaccine, had heart attack.
[01:55:34.241 --> 01:55:34.501]  It's just
[01:55:36.101 --> 01:55:47.103]  And oh, don't worry, I can walk right out here and crew members, their children died from vaccines, my grandmother was given polio, I can pull Reuters up, Bill Gates gave people polio everywhere.
[01:55:47.103 --> 01:55:49.444]  But YouTube takes those videos down.
[01:55:49.444 --> 01:55:51.144]  Joe Rogan's such a heavy hitter.
[01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:53.664]  When they threatened to take his stuff down, he went, here's Reuters.
[01:55:53.664 --> 01:55:55.485]  Alex Jones didn't lie.
[01:55:55.485 --> 01:55:59.505]  And here's Bill Gates saying 80% get sick when they take his vaccine.
[01:55:59.505 --> 01:56:02.146]  And they went, because he called their bluff, see?
[01:56:04.856 --> 01:56:06.638]  I am caught in purgatory.
[01:56:06.638 --> 01:56:09.640]  I am isolated here with you, millions of you.
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:10.340]  You understand?
[01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:12.182]  I'm like frozen in stone.
[01:56:12.182 --> 01:56:15.184]  My brain works, everything's here, but I cannot move without you.
[01:56:16.303 --> 01:56:19.285]  So you call him thanking me, it's preposterous.
[01:56:19.285 --> 01:56:20.485]  I'm in the same boat with you.
[01:56:20.485 --> 01:56:22.206]  I love you, you love me.
[01:56:22.206 --> 01:56:24.707]  We're literally together.
[01:56:24.707 --> 01:56:26.228]  That's why I'm a tribal person.
[01:56:26.228 --> 01:56:30.590]  You think I like racist black people, or racist white people, or racist whatever, all this stupid crap.
[01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:32.651]  I get that real people don't like me because of what color I am.
[01:56:32.651 --> 01:56:37.294]  A lot of folks like me who are a different color because they've got gods, just like I do.
[01:56:37.294 --> 01:56:41.356]  But we don't have time to fight with each other anymore over all this crap.
[01:56:41.356 --> 01:56:45.738]  We're under globalist New World Order attack that I can tell you ain't human, man.
[01:56:47.538 --> 01:56:49.718]  I don't need to speculate.
[01:56:49.718 --> 01:56:52.559]  I've looked at it, I'm telling you, it ain't human.
[01:56:52.559 --> 01:56:54.840]  Whatever's running this show wants to get rid of us.
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:57:03.201]  Oh, and the Bible just so told me all this, and said we'll have a world government with a market of the beast of buy and sell, and all of it comes true, all of it happens.
[01:57:03.201 --> 01:57:06.202]  I'm not, some stations don't carry the first five minutes.
[01:57:06.202 --> 01:57:10.323]  Stations, some of them do, so they want me to do it, I do the five minutes.
[01:57:10.323 --> 01:57:11.583]  But I don't want to cut, Steve.
[01:57:12.862 --> 01:57:18.166]  And Brian, and Nick, and Jason, and Granny Do-Right, and Henry, and Julie, and Jason, and Andrew.
[01:57:18.166 --> 01:57:18.306]  Short.
[01:57:18.306 --> 01:57:23.350]  So we're going to break in a few minutes, come back.
[01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:27.893]  And should I go to the order they received, or the more horrific sounding it is?
[01:57:27.893 --> 01:57:30.415]  It's all so horrible, I don't even know.
[01:57:30.415 --> 01:57:33.076]  You know, I'm just going to take it in the order they received.
[01:57:33.076 --> 01:57:35.278]  So I'm going to move quick when we come back.
[01:57:35.278 --> 01:57:36.979]  So dispense with the pleasantries.
[01:57:36.979 --> 01:57:39.721]  I love you, you love me, like Russell would say, ditto.
[01:57:39.721 --> 01:57:42.063]  And I'm just going to say where you're calling from, make your point next person.
[01:57:43.095 --> 01:57:44.636]  Don't you want to hear the other 100 callers?
[01:57:44.636 --> 01:57:47.116]  Imagine if actually only they had callers like a minute.
[01:57:47.116 --> 01:57:50.137]  We could probably get like 30, 40 callers on an hour.
[01:57:50.137 --> 01:57:52.838]  Imagine everybody lined up trying to get on right now.
[01:57:52.838 --> 01:57:55.139]  Nurses and doctors wanting to tell you what they saw.
[01:57:55.139 --> 01:57:56.819]  Hell, there's new ones every hour.
[01:57:56.819 --> 01:57:58.740]  Prestigious ones everywhere.
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:01.481]  Hell, 20 people in our hospital died after they took it.
[01:58:01.481 --> 01:58:05.022]  30 died here, 10 here, 9 there, 8 there, 7 here, 50.
[01:58:05.022 --> 01:58:10.264]  I mean, it's a freaking attack, man!
[01:58:10.264 --> 01:58:11.584]  I'll tell you what's weird about this, though.
[01:58:12.512 --> 01:58:21.959]  Breathing down my neck, stalking me, harassing me, suing me, used to get to me at a level like I was a little selfish, I was a little mad they were messing with me.
[01:58:21.959 --> 01:58:24.100]  I'm totally free now.
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:26.882]  Like, I'm not worried about anything now but beating these people.
[01:58:26.882 --> 01:58:29.143]  And I was always scared about everybody.
[01:58:29.143 --> 01:58:32.826]  But what I'm saying is, freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[01:58:32.826 --> 01:58:35.348]  And honey, we ain't got nothing if you ain't free.
[01:58:35.348 --> 01:58:37.209]  Can we play Janis Joplin coming and we can find out?
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:40.702]  Because that's what this is.
[01:58:40.702 --> 01:58:43.005]  I mean, this is so real now.
[01:58:43.005 --> 01:58:44.347]  So real for me.
[01:58:44.347 --> 01:58:46.330]  I mean, I knew they were planning it.
[01:58:46.330 --> 01:58:47.731]  I knew they meant to do it.
[01:58:47.731 --> 01:58:48.953]  I knew they beta tested it.
[01:58:51.115 --> 01:58:56.558]  But now we just can't crack up, we can't kill ourselves, we can't fight with each other, we can't let them get us down.
[01:58:56.558 --> 01:59:01.681]  We have to love God, know it's God's plan, go through it together, and know in the end these guys are going to pay.
[01:59:01.681 --> 01:59:03.022]  But that's not why we do it.
[01:59:03.022 --> 01:59:10.886]  Together we're going to be in the future and have real love and real justice and real unity compared to the division they sell in the name of unity.
[01:59:10.886 --> 01:59:17.750]  It's all division in the name of unity, disease and hate and murder and abuse in the name of unity, and it's all disunity.
[01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:20.392]  But under Christ there will be real unity.
[01:59:21.986 --> 01:59:24.467]  For a thousand years.
[01:59:24.467 --> 01:59:34.471]  And then, despite all the good we've seen, people are going to want to be satanic again, and God is going to release Satan for one more run at us.
[01:59:34.471 --> 01:59:35.992]  Because we asked for it.
[01:59:35.992 --> 01:59:42.275]  There will be devil worshippers a thousand years after this all unfolds, wanting to go back to what we're about to go through.
[01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:44.936]  And God will say, fine, free will, release him.
[01:59:44.936 --> 01:59:46.116]  Release the Kraken.
[01:59:46.116 --> 01:59:47.417]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:59:52.230 --> 01:59:55.732]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[01:59:55.732 --> 02:00:02.776]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing.
[02:00:02.776 --> 02:00:07.778]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[02:00:07.778 --> 02:00:10.740]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:17.984]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[02:00:17.984 --> 02:00:20.005]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[02:00:20.799 --> 02:00:23.120]  The enemy can't help itself.
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:27.183]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:00:27.183 --> 02:00:42.651]  We sit here as good people and get upset about that and try to stop it, and we should, but once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[02:00:42.651 --> 02:00:44.792]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[02:00:44.792 --> 02:00:48.414]  You're going under judgment, just like all the children that were aborted.
[02:00:48.414 --> 02:00:49.335]  This is the truth.
[02:00:51.204 --> 02:00:56.386]  We're good to go.
[02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:22.085]  I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana.
[02:01:22.085 --> 02:01:27.147]  I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues.
[02:01:27.147 --> 02:01:33.529]  When she walked for a slippin' time, I was holdin' Bobby standin' by.
[02:01:33.529 --> 02:01:38.791]  We sang every song that Java knew.
[02:01:38.791 --> 02:01:42.772]  Freedom is just another word for nothin' left to lose.
[02:01:42.772 --> 02:01:43.052]  Nothin'.
[02:01:47.093 --> 02:01:53.498]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Globalists are putting us into a position of nothing left to lose.
[02:01:53.498 --> 02:01:59.302]  And when you realize how soulless the Bill Gates's and Fauci's are, it doesn't make me have any vengeful feelings towards them.
[02:01:59.302 --> 02:02:05.426]  But I do have a responsibility, and so do you, to get these wolves off of our children.
[02:02:05.426 --> 02:02:09.769]  And so, that's why I've said they're assaulting us with an offensive biological weapon.
[02:02:09.769 --> 02:02:14.692]  They're assaulting us with illegal, untested violations of the Nuremberg Code and the Geneva Convention.
[02:02:15.945 --> 02:02:17.265]  Hell, I had the author of the U.S.
[02:02:17.265 --> 02:02:23.987]  Biological Weapons Law on yesterday, saying the exact same thing.
[02:02:23.987 --> 02:02:29.469]  I mean, we're not embellishing, we're not adding a damn thing to this.
[02:02:29.469 --> 02:02:37.150]  And so, there's a reason when you see all these world leaders up there getting the shots, they're not taking those damn things.
[02:02:37.150 --> 02:02:42.872]  This is a system that realigns your body against a basic protein, an amino acid in your body.
[02:02:46.118 --> 02:02:56.568]  You understand literally thousands of prominent geneticists have come out and said this is insane, this is mass murder, this is death, this is the gates of hell, this is releasing a monster.
[02:02:56.568 --> 02:03:00.832]  These are quotes.
[02:03:00.832 --> 02:03:02.334]  This was all unauthorized.
[02:03:02.334 --> 02:03:04.416]  They couldn't get any of this approved just two years ago.
[02:03:07.245 --> 02:03:16.411]  And now they're just doing it and getting enough of us to do it because they know once we do it to ourselves and our children, we'll decide it was okay.
[02:03:16.411 --> 02:03:18.453]  I'm going to get the shot no matter what you say.
[02:03:18.453 --> 02:03:19.434]  I'm going to protect others.
[02:03:19.434 --> 02:03:21.775]  And then they die.
[02:03:21.775 --> 02:03:25.117]  And their family members went, well, I'm willing to die too.
[02:03:25.117 --> 02:03:26.178]  I see the headlines.
[02:03:26.178 --> 02:03:26.859]  Mainstream news.
[02:03:26.859 --> 02:03:29.481]  I'm willing to die to protect others.
[02:03:29.481 --> 02:03:32.723]  And they use our own instinct of life preservation to kill us!
[02:03:34.190 --> 02:03:40.475]  And it doesn't even protect you, the fine print says!
[02:03:40.475 --> 02:03:40.896]  There it is.
[02:03:40.896 --> 02:03:47.221]  Journals proclaim she would love to die from the AstraZeneca vaccine if it helps others.
[02:03:47.221 --> 02:03:49.303]  All right, let's just rush through your calls here.
[02:03:49.303 --> 02:03:52.385]  In the order they're receiving, I'm trying to go as quick as possible.
[02:03:52.385 --> 02:03:53.966]  Let's talk to Steve in Tennessee.
[02:03:53.966 --> 02:03:57.629]  They had a call yesterday about a man losing his father to the vaccine.
[02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:58.810]  He was totally healthy.
[02:03:58.810 --> 02:03:59.171]  Died.
[02:03:59.171 --> 02:04:00.512]  Took him a week to die.
[02:04:00.512 --> 02:04:01.873]  And slowly paralyzed till he
[02:04:02.995 --> 02:04:05.938]  Heart and lungs were paralyzed, finally died.
[02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:08.019]  Another casualty of Bill Gates's war.
[02:04:08.019 --> 02:04:12.803]  Steve in Tennessee, tell us what you've seen.
[02:04:12.803 --> 02:04:23.692]  Yes, this was actually about my mother-in-law who received her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and she had sudden seizure-like activity.
[02:04:23.692 --> 02:04:27.656]  Also, they describe it as violent tremors.
[02:04:27.656 --> 02:04:30.498]  She was taken to the emergency room via ambulance
[02:04:31.321 --> 02:04:36.123]  She was hospitalized three days, had the million-dollar workup with no real findings.
[02:04:36.123 --> 02:04:40.525]  Long story short, she was a very active 81-year-old.
[02:04:40.525 --> 02:04:44.027]  She's now discharged to home with home health care.
[02:04:44.027 --> 02:04:46.288]  She's had her keys taken away.
[02:04:46.288 --> 02:04:48.129]  She can no longer drive.
[02:04:48.129 --> 02:04:50.650]  She's using a cane.
[02:04:50.650 --> 02:04:55.672]  And so basically, who knows what's really going to happen with her at this point.
[02:04:55.672 --> 02:04:59.834]  But basically, she just, her life was changed overnight.
[02:05:01.369 --> 02:05:03.532]  It was the Pfizer.
[02:05:03.532 --> 02:05:05.093]  It was the second dose.
[02:05:16.741 --> 02:05:25.803]  Well, my wife is a physician, and she recommended that she not take it, and she was basically, or she told my wife that, you know, she was 81.
[02:05:25.803 --> 02:05:30.383]  She can make her own decisions, and so I don't think she's too happy with what she's done.
[02:05:30.383 --> 02:05:36.304]  But I also wanted to say, with my wife working in the hospital, two other situations I wanted to tell you about.
[02:05:36.304 --> 02:05:45.966]  The nurse that works on my wife's floor, her father just had windows, and he is currently in the ICU after an anaphylactic shock.
[02:05:46.568 --> 02:05:48.690]  Hold on, talk right into your phone.
[02:05:48.690 --> 02:05:51.112]  Did he just take the vaccine too?
[02:05:51.112 --> 02:05:57.358]  He just took the vaccine and he's currently in the ICU after anaphylactic shock.
[02:05:57.358 --> 02:06:05.666]  And also there was someone come into the emergency room after the vaccination and they tested positive for COVID.
[02:06:05.666 --> 02:06:07.248]  So whatever we make of that.
[02:06:08.738 --> 02:06:09.199]  Wow!
[02:06:09.199 --> 02:06:12.422]  So, I mean, you're just seeing it to your left, your right, all around you.
[02:06:12.422 --> 02:06:16.625]  And the literature admits that you test positive after the vaccine, usually.
[02:06:16.625 --> 02:06:21.870]  So, have you seen where they admit that you can still get COVID even though you're vaccinated?
[02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:22.230]  Yes.
[02:06:22.230 --> 02:06:23.952]  So, and I'm actually seeing proof of it.
[02:06:23.952 --> 02:06:29.377]  Now, granted, of course, I don't have patient names or any of that, but I hear a lot of stories about what's going on with it.
[02:06:29.770 --> 02:06:44.099]  And I did want to quickly ask you one question about when Trump went on, after he was discharged from Walter Reed, and he went on this big bandwagon about the Regeneron cocktail.
[02:06:44.099 --> 02:06:45.399]  I didn't hear any more of that.
[02:06:45.399 --> 02:06:48.381]  So whatever became of Regeneron?
[02:06:48.381 --> 02:06:50.903]  Well, it's a gene mouse.
[02:06:52.026 --> 02:06:56.267]  Some type of mouse antibodies, and I mean, they got all sorts of stuff to make you feel great.
[02:06:56.267 --> 02:07:00.788]  And if you're 75 and working your ass off, a lot of people have a lot of infections already in their blood.
[02:07:00.788 --> 02:07:02.628]  And I'm sure whatever they gave him did clean him up.
[02:07:02.628 --> 02:07:05.528]  And so, you know, he looked great, sounded great for about a month.
[02:07:05.528 --> 02:07:06.949]  The issue is you got to keep getting those.
[02:07:06.949 --> 02:07:09.209]  So, yeah, we haven't heard about that since then.
[02:07:09.209 --> 02:07:09.929]  Thank you so much.
[02:07:09.929 --> 02:07:13.730]  And I'm glad to hear your mother-in-law and others aren't dead, but they may be soon.
[02:07:13.730 --> 02:07:14.050]  Wow.
[02:07:14.050 --> 02:07:14.750]  Did you hear that?
[02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:18.831]  Two people in his family fighting for their lives after the vaccine.
[02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:19.291]  Incredible.
[02:07:20.302 --> 02:07:23.124]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:07:23.124 --> 02:07:31.109]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Texas.
[02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.970]  Jason, you're on the air.
[02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:34.011]  Welcome.
[02:07:34.011 --> 02:07:35.932]  Hey, Alex.
[02:07:35.932 --> 02:07:36.232]  Welcome.
[02:07:36.232 --> 02:07:37.533]  Go ahead.
[02:07:37.533 --> 02:07:48.620]  Yeah, I just talked to you on Monday, and I just told you the story about a girl from back home in Minnesota that took the second dose of Moderna, and now she's having severe back pain and chest pain.
[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:49.181]  Yes, you called.
[02:07:50.271 --> 02:08:00.981]  Literally two days later, my mom called and said, grandma now is having heart problems after getting her second dose.
[02:08:00.981 --> 02:08:01.241]  Wow.
[02:08:01.241 --> 02:08:01.341]  Yeah.
[02:08:01.341 --> 02:08:06.286]  That's what we see everywhere is convulsions and heart problems because it fries your nerves.
[02:08:06.286 --> 02:08:09.349]  Uh, so, so is your family starting to wake up?
[02:08:09.349 --> 02:08:12.131]  Yeah, my mom, it's hilarious.
[02:08:12.131 --> 02:08:15.875]  She's no effing way am I getting this vaccine.
[02:08:16.952 --> 02:08:18.073]  Let me ask you this.
[02:08:18.073 --> 02:08:19.974]  Why do you think Gates made his run at us?
[02:08:19.974 --> 02:08:23.977]  Because I thought it'd be a soft kill that kills you down the road, which the evidence shows it does.
[02:08:23.977 --> 02:08:26.159]  They already did animal studies secretly.
[02:08:26.159 --> 02:08:27.139]  They didn't skip those folks.
[02:08:27.139 --> 02:08:29.721]  They don't do animal studies because somebody dying gets sick.
[02:08:29.721 --> 02:08:31.422]  They already did them, again, secretly.
[02:08:31.422 --> 02:08:34.004]  Why do you think they're doing such a reckless run at us with this?
[02:08:34.004 --> 02:08:35.565]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:08:35.565 --> 02:08:37.066]  I was just going to say that, Isaac.
[02:08:37.066 --> 02:08:38.787]  They're coming full speed now.
[02:08:38.787 --> 02:08:40.068]  They want us dead.
[02:08:40.068 --> 02:08:40.369]  Now.
[02:08:40.369 --> 02:08:40.629]  Great.
[02:08:45.316 --> 02:08:45.856]  Damn right!
[02:08:45.856 --> 02:08:51.137]  Well, you know, remember 10 years ago, the case for killing Granny Newsweek, and Bill Gates was quoted saying we need to get rid of people above 75.
[02:08:51.137 --> 02:08:55.878]  Ezekiel Emanuel, who wrote Obamacare, said, I believe people should be killed at 75.
[02:08:55.878 --> 02:08:58.779]  I mean, these are psychotics, brother!
[02:08:58.779 --> 02:09:05.100]  You see, I love, uh, that, uh, Rand Paul, what he did to Fauci the other day, was just epic.
[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:06.401]  It was incredible.
[02:09:06.401 --> 02:09:08.061]  We need more people like him.
[02:09:08.061 --> 02:09:09.181]  We need people like you.
[02:09:09.181 --> 02:09:10.382]  We need everybody.
[02:09:10.382 --> 02:09:11.922]  We need to attack these people.
[02:09:13.015 --> 02:09:13.735]  I totally agree.
[02:09:13.735 --> 02:09:14.316]  God bless you.
[02:09:14.316 --> 02:09:17.056]  I mean, look, you gotta get in people's faces.
[02:09:17.056 --> 02:09:21.838]  When I'm in a grocery store and they say, sir, wear your mask, I go, there are thousands of deaths from the vaccine.
[02:09:21.838 --> 02:09:23.219]  It does not protect you.
[02:09:23.219 --> 02:09:24.979]  The masks give you bacterial pneumonia.
[02:09:24.979 --> 02:09:26.360]  The masks are never coming off.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:27.380]  They go, sir, sir, we're fine.
[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:28.000]  We're fine.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.161]  They just shut down.
[02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:31.201]  They don't grab me, break my arm, call the police.
[02:09:31.201 --> 02:09:33.122]  They shut up.
[02:09:33.122 --> 02:09:35.483]  And I do it constantly.
[02:09:35.483 --> 02:09:36.483]  Because I'm not a slave.
[02:09:36.483 --> 02:09:36.943]  God bless you.
[02:09:36.943 --> 02:09:37.644]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:37.644 --> 02:09:39.524]  All right.
[02:09:39.524 --> 02:09:41.065]  Up next on the longest is Jason.
[02:09:42.074 --> 02:09:49.527]  In North Carolina, the Julie in Maryland, Henry in Chicago, Granny Do-Right in Kentucky.
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:53.663]  And just everybody else, we're going to go to you and the order you received.
[02:09:53.663 --> 02:09:54.583]  I need to stay on air.
[02:09:54.583 --> 02:09:55.504]  I need money to do it.
[02:09:55.504 --> 02:09:58.907]  The enemy's trying to shut us down from a thousand angles, but thanks to you, we're still here.
[02:09:58.907 --> 02:10:00.408]  Plus, we sell products you need.
[02:10:00.408 --> 02:10:04.031]  And folks, everybody needs to boost their immune system, period.
[02:10:04.031 --> 02:10:05.692]  Well, Prostagard isn't just for the prostate.
[02:10:05.692 --> 02:10:06.994]  It's a great multivitamin.
[02:10:06.994 --> 02:10:10.516]  We saw Palmetto that, for whatever reason, is so good for all the glands in your body.
[02:10:10.516 --> 02:10:14.059]  Not just your prostate, but that's the one that's been proven to be so anti-cancerous.
[02:10:14.059 --> 02:10:14.740]  You can even say that.
[02:10:16.441 --> 02:10:16.802]  I don't know.
[02:10:40.951 --> 02:10:54.283]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[02:10:54.283 --> 02:10:56.025]  It's very bittersweet.
[02:10:56.025 --> 02:10:59.008]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[02:10:59.008 --> 02:11:00.269]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[02:11:00.269 --> 02:11:01.190]  But I don't care about that.
[02:11:01.190 --> 02:11:02.451]  I care about beating the new world order.
[02:11:03.217 --> 02:11:07.923]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[02:11:07.923 --> 02:11:11.288]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[02:11:11.288 --> 02:11:12.790]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:13.992]  But let's just say this.
[02:11:13.992 --> 02:11:15.313]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[02:11:15.313 --> 02:11:17.777]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[02:11:18.397 --> 02:11:22.038]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:11:22.038 --> 02:11:24.599]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[02:11:24.599 --> 02:11:28.640]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy that are still great, do they fund freedom?
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:29.741]  No, a lot of them don't.
[02:11:29.741 --> 02:11:36.203]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[02:11:36.203 --> 02:11:37.923]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[02:11:37.923 --> 02:11:40.764]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[02:11:41.344 --> 02:11:44.466]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[02:11:44.466 --> 02:11:52.129]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.

[02:12:34.363 --> 02:12:37.484]  Part of our big blowout sale that's taking place right now.
[02:12:37.484 --> 02:12:38.224]  We also have
[02:12:39.253 --> 02:12:41.434]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:13:12.474 --> 02:13:18.615]  The globalists see themselves as God, as guardians of the Earth.
[02:13:18.615 --> 02:13:27.276]  And they behave as if they have a gun to their head to carry out super unpopular, illegal euthanasia of the old, sterilization of the young.
[02:13:27.276 --> 02:13:34.458]  And they're setting the precedent for us to have jobs, or be able to move about, to take whatever they want to put in our bodies.
[02:13:34.458 --> 02:13:36.538]  We've always said global government is about
[02:13:37.472 --> 02:13:47.680]  Digital passports proving you've been vaccinated with whatever they want to put in your body as gene therapies, including viruses that actually attack parts of the brain.
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:50.363]  And they say, oh, it's an anti-stress vaccine.
[02:13:50.363 --> 02:13:53.545]  So they can load anything they want into these viruses.
[02:13:53.545 --> 02:13:55.387]  It's all proprietary.
[02:13:55.387 --> 02:13:58.029]  And this is next level engineering.
[02:13:58.029 --> 02:14:00.731]  Have you seen the Bourne movies?
[02:14:00.731 --> 02:14:02.092]  Well, they have one of the Bourne movies.
[02:14:02.092 --> 02:14:02.733]  I forget the name.
[02:14:02.733 --> 02:14:05.135]  I think it's Bourne Origin.
[02:14:06.531 --> 02:14:13.176]  It's the one that goes back where they came from, and it's a virus they inject them with that goes in and destroys parts of the brain of inhibition.
[02:14:13.176 --> 02:14:21.702]  Because let's say if I could bench press 300 pounds, if I take my governor away, I can bench press 600 pounds.
[02:14:21.702 --> 02:14:24.344]  We have governors that block us.
[02:14:24.344 --> 02:14:28.567]  Well, in the movie, the virus has gone in and reprogrammed the brain.
[02:14:28.567 --> 02:14:30.549]  That's all real, folks.
[02:14:30.549 --> 02:14:32.850]  And just type in Chinese super soldiers.
[02:14:32.850 --> 02:14:33.871]  That's what they've been doing to them.
[02:14:35.057 --> 02:14:41.242]  Yeah, Bourne Legacy, a gene, dope, super spies aren't as far-fetched as they sound.
[02:14:41.242 --> 02:14:43.544]  And I told you back when it first came out that was the case.
[02:14:43.544 --> 02:14:48.767]  So, so, this is already going on in the lab, it's already here, they want to roll it out.
[02:14:48.767 --> 02:14:54.332]  But it's not where you get super soldier powers, it's where you die in a year.
[02:14:54.332 --> 02:14:57.154]  So, they're not going to give you all the good stuff, they're going to give you death.
[02:14:57.154 --> 02:14:58.495]  Alright, let's go to the phone calls.
[02:15:00.959 --> 02:15:02.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in California.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:03.800]  John, you're on the air.
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:07.741]  Go ahead and tell us what you witnessed with the Loving Vaccines.
[02:15:07.741 --> 02:15:09.482]  Alex.
[02:15:09.482 --> 02:15:09.782]  Yes, sir.
[02:15:09.782 --> 02:15:11.662]  Go ahead.
[02:15:11.662 --> 02:15:14.623]  My father took the shot, I'd say about three weeks ago.
[02:15:14.623 --> 02:15:17.344]  He was in the hospital about seven to eight days.
[02:15:17.344 --> 02:15:18.284]  His color changed.
[02:15:18.284 --> 02:15:20.245]  He turned gray.
[02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:22.326]  After he took the shot, he went outside and tried to
[02:15:24.028 --> 02:15:25.049]  Your father isn't stupid.
[02:15:25.049 --> 02:15:26.810]  He is in a medical trance.
[02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:29.972]  TV, especially older people, puts them into a near-sleep daydream.
[02:15:51.514 --> 02:16:00.324]  And so just type in, study links mRNA vaccines to brain fog Alzheimer's, and then you can just give them the literature.
[02:16:00.324 --> 02:16:02.747]  But I think he knows that now.
[02:16:02.747 --> 02:16:06.151]  What it does is it manipulates proteins in the body.
[02:16:06.151 --> 02:16:11.577]  Well, a lot of people have prion or prion type stuff in the brain when they're older.
[02:16:11.577 --> 02:16:11.978]  And so
[02:16:12.771 --> 02:16:16.614]  When you take one of these, it causes a ballooning in those tissues.
[02:16:16.614 --> 02:16:19.777]  That's why they say, oh, you don't have cancer when you take the mRNA vaccine.
[02:16:19.777 --> 02:16:22.459]  It'll just make all your tissues look like you have cancer.
[02:16:22.459 --> 02:16:24.240]  So, sir, it's a weapon.
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:25.361]  It's horrible.
[02:16:25.361 --> 02:16:31.686]  And, you know, I mean, if your father ever comes back to normal, he needs to realize that he was hit hard.
[02:16:31.686 --> 02:16:34.108]  But see, men are especially like, I'm rough and tough.
[02:16:34.108 --> 02:16:34.889]  I'm not going to be a wimp.
[02:16:36.558 --> 02:16:43.223]  That's the problem with conservatives or just normal people is they're designed to just get over something and not make a big deal about it.
[02:16:43.223 --> 02:16:47.306]  But no, no, we have to all act like leftists and run around and warn everybody and scream and yell.
[02:16:47.306 --> 02:16:49.948]  Now, the left's not going to run around screaming and yell.
[02:16:49.948 --> 02:16:51.849]  Because I tell you, the left's not taking these vaccines.
[02:16:51.849 --> 02:16:53.010]  They know what they're doing.
[02:16:53.010 --> 02:16:56.912]  They are a demon cult, sir.
[02:16:56.912 --> 02:16:58.654]  Yeah, his color has changed.
[02:16:58.654 --> 02:17:01.095]  You can look at him and he looks gray now.
[02:17:01.095 --> 02:17:02.536]  I call that the green look.
[02:17:02.536 --> 02:17:03.057]  Absolutely.
[02:17:03.057 --> 02:17:03.537]  It's not good.
[02:17:04.602 --> 02:17:07.165]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:07.165 --> 02:17:10.108]  Every cell in his body is being taken over by viruses.
[02:17:10.108 --> 02:17:11.650]  That's what this is.
[02:17:11.650 --> 02:17:12.831]  Did he take an mRNA vaccine?
[02:17:12.831 --> 02:17:14.433]  Which one did he take?
[02:17:14.433 --> 02:17:14.833]  You know what?
[02:17:14.833 --> 02:17:15.895]  I'm not exactly sure.
[02:17:15.895 --> 02:17:17.596]  I didn't go with him.
[02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:22.482]  Well, if he took the Moderna or the Pfizer, that's an mRNA and reprograms everything.
[02:17:23.832 --> 02:17:46.702]  Oh wow yeah yeah but also I own a business and my business I make nobody wear a mask and you know most of the I have a lot of younger guys I nobody wears a mask you know I mean you know we really try hard to push your you know basically hey you know this is a lie you know the you know everything that they're telling us is bs you know try to think for yourself you know ask information
[02:17:47.282 --> 02:17:58.847]  You know, I just try to be, you know, I'm lucky that I've, you know, we've ran a good business during this pandemic, man, and we've tried to maintain some normalcy for a lot of people.
[02:17:58.847 --> 02:18:03.489]  Well, God bless you being an island in a sea of insanity, and God bless your dad, and I hope he gets better.
[02:18:03.489 --> 02:18:08.451]  Give your dad, I'm not a doctor, but if I was you, a lot of it's anti-inflammatory.
[02:18:08.451 --> 02:18:12.453]  I would get him on, the doctors won't tell you this, and I'm not giving you advice, that's what I would do.
[02:18:12.453 --> 02:18:14.254]  I would take some Benadryl.
[02:18:15.387 --> 02:18:23.029]  If I was him, I'd put him on a regular non-prescription dose of Benadryl for about a week and see if that gets the inflammation in his brain down.
[02:18:23.029 --> 02:18:24.410]  Thanks for the call.
[02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:26.851]  Okay.
[02:18:26.851 --> 02:18:28.771]  I'm going to go to Julie in Maryland the next.
[02:18:28.771 --> 02:18:33.653]  Dan says, five celebrities that have died from the vaccine no one is talking about.
[02:18:33.653 --> 02:18:34.713]  They talked about Hank Aaron.
[02:18:34.713 --> 02:18:36.914]  They talked some about Marvelous Marvin Hagler.
[02:18:36.914 --> 02:18:37.954]  But who else is he talking about?
[02:18:37.954 --> 02:18:39.194]  We'll talk to him next segment.
[02:18:39.194 --> 02:18:43.456]  But right now, let's go to Julie in Maryland.
[02:18:43.456 --> 02:18:44.416]  Julie, thanks for holding.
[02:18:50.164 --> 02:18:51.924]  Sounds like you're angry.
[02:18:51.924 --> 02:18:56.166]  I'm Uncle Alex, my mom, my 80-year-old mom.
[02:18:56.166 --> 02:18:57.266]  You woke her up.
[02:18:57.266 --> 02:18:59.807]  Please say hello to her.
[02:18:59.807 --> 02:19:00.227]  I do.
[02:19:00.227 --> 02:19:00.927]  Hello, Mom.
[02:19:00.927 --> 02:19:01.467]  We love you.
[02:19:01.467 --> 02:19:03.348]  What's your name?
[02:19:03.348 --> 02:19:04.648]  Well, it's Elizabeth.
[02:19:04.648 --> 02:19:05.649]  Hi, Alex.
[02:19:05.649 --> 02:19:07.630]  We just love you.
[02:19:07.630 --> 02:19:08.930]  Well, we love you too, Elizabeth.
[02:19:08.930 --> 02:19:10.050]  Please tell folks about the show.
[02:19:10.050 --> 02:19:11.271]  We're trying to save lives.
[02:19:11.271 --> 02:19:13.472]  What is it like to hear all these stories?
[02:19:13.472 --> 02:19:13.752]  All right.
[02:19:13.752 --> 02:19:14.632]  So listen, Alex.
[02:19:15.489 --> 02:19:20.155]  Uh, we hear him all day long, but I want to tell you this real quick.
[02:19:20.155 --> 02:19:22.478]  This is a highlight of my year.
[02:19:22.478 --> 02:19:24.121]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:19:24.121 --> 02:19:29.328]  We have BandDot video or InfoWars on all of our four vehicles.
[02:19:29.328 --> 02:19:30.770]  You woke my mom up.
[02:19:31.491 --> 02:19:40.615]  People say on the response, like the comments, that they're saying there are lies about the products.
[02:19:40.615 --> 02:19:42.195]  We love your products.
[02:19:42.195 --> 02:19:46.157]  You didn't have any toothpaste because we bought it all.
[02:19:46.157 --> 02:19:55.240]  You're not going to like this, but I'm telling you, anybody that's been listening for over a year and is not supporting you, I want you to hang up right now.
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:59.442]  You need to support InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:20:01.078 --> 02:20:05.281]  And I want to tell you, Alex, we live on a street with 16 other people.
[02:20:05.281 --> 02:20:10.043]  We're one of three people that refused to take the vaccine.
[02:20:10.043 --> 02:20:12.865]  I'm not... I used to be a nice person.
[02:20:12.865 --> 02:20:15.166]  I'm not a nice person anymore.
[02:20:15.166 --> 02:20:18.849]  I school everybody I come in contact with.
[02:20:18.849 --> 02:20:20.870]  I tell them, I say... Well, let me interrupt you, Julie.
[02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:21.990]  You are a nice person.
[02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:23.371]  They say it's nice to lay down and die.
[02:20:23.371 --> 02:20:26.933]  You're a nice person standing up and warning people.
[02:20:26.933 --> 02:20:27.854]  I'm a snot.
[02:20:29.019 --> 02:20:31.780]  And thank you for saying that, but I'm not nice.
[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:33.381]  I'm tired of people.
[02:20:33.381 --> 02:20:35.121]  I'm tired of them.
[02:20:35.121 --> 02:20:37.702]  I ask everybody, excuse me, sir.
[02:20:37.702 --> 02:20:38.483]  Excuse me, ma'am.
[02:20:38.483 --> 02:20:40.083]  Can I ask you a question?
[02:20:40.083 --> 02:20:42.124]  Are you going to take the vaccine?
[02:20:42.124 --> 02:20:43.124]  Yes, I am.
[02:20:43.124 --> 02:20:44.285]  Can't wait to get it.
[02:20:44.285 --> 02:20:46.726]  Please, ma'am, don't take the vaccine.
[02:20:46.726 --> 02:20:49.507]  This morning I had my mom call my sister.
[02:20:49.507 --> 02:20:52.468]  Please, Lisa, don't take the vaccine.
[02:20:52.468 --> 02:20:54.248]  No, we're going to take the vaccine.
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:58.761]  I wake up every morning.
[02:20:58.761 --> 02:21:01.023]  I start listening to Harrison.
[02:21:01.023 --> 02:21:02.044]  I listen to you.
[02:21:02.044 --> 02:21:04.526]  Then I listen to Owen.
[02:21:04.526 --> 02:21:06.367]  I have you on all day long.
[02:21:06.367 --> 02:21:08.929]  You blow out my battery on my telephone every day.
[02:21:08.929 --> 02:21:14.413]  Well, ma'am, you're beautiful, but listen, keep warning folks, and we'll edit down all the callers that have family members dying.
[02:21:14.413 --> 02:21:16.975]  Hopefully you can just make your neighbors watch this info.
[02:21:16.975 --> 02:21:17.455]  But you know what?
[02:21:17.455 --> 02:21:18.196]  Here's the good news.
[02:21:18.196 --> 02:21:19.277]  It's the bad news, too.
[02:21:19.277 --> 02:21:24.581]  When they get hurt from the vaccine, they'll be awake permanently if they survive.
[02:21:24.581 --> 02:21:24.661]  Oh!
[02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:29.520]  I'm sorry.
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:32.781]  I tell everybody I can, and they don't want to know.
[02:21:32.781 --> 02:21:34.061]  Julie, listen here.
[02:21:34.061 --> 02:21:35.862]  It's been happening for 27 years.
[02:21:35.862 --> 02:21:36.762]  Later, they'll listen.
[02:21:36.762 --> 02:21:37.722]  God bless you.
[02:21:37.722 --> 02:21:39.883]  And whoever told you about the show, Julie, they're on.
[02:21:39.883 --> 02:21:41.063]  Quickly, Julie, in 10 seconds.
[02:21:41.063 --> 02:21:43.384]  How'd you learn about InfoWars?
[02:21:43.384 --> 02:21:46.425]  Um, golly, Alex.
[02:21:46.425 --> 02:21:47.685]  Maybe from Mark Dice.
[02:21:47.685 --> 02:21:49.146]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:21:49.146 --> 02:21:49.866]  Alright, God bless you.
[02:21:51.275 --> 02:21:58.602]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes Infowars has had.
[02:21:58.602 --> 02:22:01.905]  If you're paying attention, you know what we've done together.
[02:22:01.905 --> 02:22:11.034]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[02:22:11.875 --> 02:22:14.256]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[02:22:14.256 --> 02:22:19.858]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[02:22:19.858 --> 02:22:23.019]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[02:22:23.019 --> 02:22:25.800]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:29.101]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[02:22:29.101 --> 02:22:34.783]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[02:22:34.783 --> 02:22:36.524]  We have the power.
[02:22:36.524 --> 02:22:39.825]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[02:22:40.817 --> 02:22:46.390]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't come.
[02:22:46.390 --> 02:22:47.512]  So be the Paul Revere's you are.
[02:22:55.302 --> 02:23:00.287]  Look, I've proven that InfoWars information is some of the best in the world.
[02:23:00.287 --> 02:23:02.769]  It's just absolutely on target.
[02:23:02.769 --> 02:23:05.832]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[02:23:05.832 --> 02:23:07.353]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[02:23:07.353 --> 02:23:12.157]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[02:23:12.157 --> 02:23:13.779]  A raising tide raises all ships.
[02:23:15.131 --> 02:23:27.477]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at InfoWarsTour.com are the very best sourced, wild-crafted, organic, and natural product you're going to find anywhere.

[02:23:42.050 --> 02:23:43.511]  So don't procrastinate.
[02:23:43.511 --> 02:23:51.917]  Take action today at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:23:51.917 --> 02:23:55.600]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads and I get overly excited.
[02:23:56.787 --> 02:23:58.808]  People ask me all the time, they go, Jones, are you on cocaine?
[02:23:58.808 --> 02:23:59.888]  Are you on meth?
[02:23:59.888 --> 02:24:01.269]  How are you so excited?
[02:24:01.269 --> 02:24:10.092]  How do I not get excited about world government, forced masks, forced inoculations, open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved?
[02:24:10.092 --> 02:24:11.333]  I'm sorry.
[02:24:11.333 --> 02:24:12.453]  I'm a fighter.
[02:24:12.453 --> 02:24:15.174]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[02:24:15.174 --> 02:24:17.315]  And so I'll just say this.
[02:24:17.315 --> 02:24:18.335]  I try to be calm.
[02:24:18.335 --> 02:24:20.116]  I try to be focused.
[02:24:20.116 --> 02:24:22.297]  I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[02:24:23.843 --> 02:24:27.225]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[02:24:27.225 --> 02:24:33.347]  Because you have to realize, when I tell you that you're the Infowar, that's not me patting you on the head.
[02:24:33.347 --> 02:24:36.129]  You are 99% of the equation.
[02:24:36.129 --> 02:24:43.892]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, Infowarshore.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[02:24:43.892 --> 02:24:46.093]  So, you are the Infowar.
[02:24:46.093 --> 02:24:47.714]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[02:24:47.714 --> 02:24:48.995]  Thank you for all you've done.
[02:24:48.995 --> 02:24:51.396]  Now let's take action together and take down the Globalist.
[02:24:54.518 --> 02:24:59.783]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[02:24:59.783 --> 02:25:06.628]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[02:25:06.628 --> 02:25:08.290]  With or without a battery.
[02:25:09.068 --> 02:25:15.175]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[02:25:15.175 --> 02:25:16.016]  Excellent.

[02:25:21.623 --> 02:25:24.647]  And you can too, at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:25:26.208 --> 02:25:36.971]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.

[02:25:41.892 --> 02:25:47.793]  Support the InfoWar and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today.
[02:25:47.793 --> 02:25:48.874]  InfoWarStore.com
[02:25:55.041 --> 02:25:57.683]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:26:19.051 --> 02:26:26.294]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're hearing caller after caller after caller that has lost family members or had them have heart attacks or become deathly ill.
[02:26:26.294 --> 02:26:27.995]  And then we see it all over the world.
[02:26:27.995 --> 02:26:31.177]  India banned the Pfizer shot.
[02:26:31.177 --> 02:26:34.718]  They're moving to ban the other mRNA shots.
[02:26:34.718 --> 02:26:39.440]  In Australia, the other vaccine was giving HIV positive test.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:40.981]  You've got all this mass death happening.
[02:26:40.981 --> 02:26:45.263]  They say it's not going to protect you because they could never make a vaccine for the common cold.
[02:26:45.845 --> 02:26:47.906]  Because it's such a part of our body.
[02:26:47.906 --> 02:26:50.607]  There's so many of these viruses.
[02:26:50.607 --> 02:26:54.349]  So it's going to cause autoimmune responses to regular viruses and just kill you.
[02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:55.850]  Or make you wish you were dead.
[02:26:55.850 --> 02:26:57.950]  It's going to shut your immune system off or turn it up too high.
[02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:59.131]  It's going to give you cancer.
[02:26:59.131 --> 02:27:03.113]  And you hear the calls flooding in.
[02:27:03.113 --> 02:27:05.894]  And you try to talk about it.
[02:27:05.894 --> 02:27:07.155]  And the video goes viral.
[02:27:07.155 --> 02:27:08.035]  You're a medical doctor.
[02:27:08.035 --> 02:27:08.715]  You're a scientist.
[02:27:08.715 --> 02:27:13.277]  You're the former head of Rockefeller Hospital.
[02:27:13.277 --> 02:27:14.478]  And you come out and say this a year ago.
[02:27:15.325 --> 02:27:20.450]  Their head scientist said, oh, this is going to cause mutations, the vaccine, which they now admit, mainline news.
[02:27:20.450 --> 02:27:24.354]  But I say that, or a doctor says that, YouTube takes it down.
[02:27:24.354 --> 02:27:27.056]  Aiding and abetting this murder.
[02:27:27.056 --> 02:27:29.279]  So, they've crossed the Rubicon.
[02:27:29.279 --> 02:27:31.841]  They've drawn major first blood here.
[02:27:31.841 --> 02:27:37.006]  And that shows they're going for broke and are planning even bigger escalations in the future.
[02:27:37.006 --> 02:27:38.668]  That's what Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and others say is.
[02:27:39.375 --> 02:27:46.417]  Within six months to a year, it's going to cause massive autoimmune responses, even bigger, and they're going to say it's a new COVID variant when it's the vaccine killing people.
[02:27:46.417 --> 02:27:50.199]  Because they've always wondered why the Spanish flu killed 50 million people.
[02:27:50.199 --> 02:27:55.900]  They were having an autoimmune response to a flu virus that they already had been in contact with.
[02:27:55.900 --> 02:28:01.622]  But for some reason, when they came back in contact with it, they died in hours from an autoimmune response.
[02:28:01.622 --> 02:28:05.443]  And they won't tell the doctors, give them a steroid, give them Benadryl.
[02:28:05.443 --> 02:28:06.984]  They won't tell anybody when this happens.
[02:28:07.904 --> 02:28:09.125]  They go, oh, you've got COVID.
[02:28:09.125 --> 02:28:11.007]  Well, wait, I took a COVID shot two weeks ago.
[02:28:11.007 --> 02:28:13.108]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[02:28:13.108 --> 02:28:19.773]  We're going to put a tube down your throat and blow your lungs up that during an autoimmune response will kill you faster.
[02:28:19.773 --> 02:28:21.355]  So that's how technocrats work.
[02:28:21.355 --> 02:28:24.297]  They know the general public doesn't have technological understanding.
[02:28:24.297 --> 02:28:29.081]  And so they set it all where it's like a black box to us, but they know exactly what's going to unfold.
[02:28:30.532 --> 02:28:32.692]  Yeah, you got to watch that interview with her.
[02:28:32.692 --> 02:28:35.033]  It's got a million and a half views and it's 50 million views.
[02:28:35.033 --> 02:28:39.174]  Medical doctor exposes mass eugenics experimentation called COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:28:39.174 --> 02:28:40.494]  Bandai video.
[02:28:40.494 --> 02:28:43.395]  Share that like your lives depend on it.
[02:28:43.395 --> 02:28:49.456]  Let's go to Andrew and then we'll go to Dan and others.
[02:28:49.456 --> 02:28:55.817]  Andrew, tell us your take on and what you've seen with these so-called vaccines.
[02:28:55.817 --> 02:28:56.077]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:56.932 --> 02:29:02.556]  So, uh, going back all the way to last summer, I tried calling in whenever I first started last summer.
[02:29:02.556 --> 02:29:11.383]  And what my mother-in-law saw was, um, she was a nurse and she actually had COVID.
[02:29:11.383 --> 02:29:17.988]  And whenever she had COVID, uh, they were trying to give her treatment and she had asthma.
[02:29:17.988 --> 02:29:24.914]  And so it affected more her, more, more so than, uh, her husband and
[02:29:26.031 --> 02:29:29.273]  Because she had asthma.
[02:29:29.273 --> 02:29:36.676]  And so my father-in-law, he wasn't affected at all by COVID because he didn't have any comorbidities.
[02:29:36.676 --> 02:29:50.363]  And so at the same time that that was going on, on that same side of the family, I had a family member that developed, that had COVID, and he was perfectly healthy.
[02:29:50.363 --> 02:29:55.486]  And whenever they put him on the ventilator, that's whenever he died.
[02:29:56.244 --> 02:30:00.087]  And they put COVID-19 on the death certificate.
[02:30:00.087 --> 02:30:05.850]  So let's be clear, he was healthy but tested positive, probably a false positive, and they killed him with a ventilator?
[02:30:05.850 --> 02:30:06.511]  Uh, yes sir.
[02:30:06.511 --> 02:30:18.799]  And everybody knew there that he died from bacterial pneumonia, but in order for them, like, I'm not there, but what I assumed was that they could get that money that everybody knew that they were getting.
[02:30:18.799 --> 02:30:22.461]  $53,000 if they innovate you, yeah.
[02:30:22.461 --> 02:30:23.762]  And he was perfectly healthy.
[02:30:24.286 --> 02:30:30.988]  And whenever she had to be taken to the hospital, she said that she got an IV drip, and that was all, and she said she didn't want anything else.
[02:30:30.988 --> 02:30:33.108]  And so... You're damn right, sir!
[02:30:33.108 --> 02:30:35.429]  That is a horrible situation.
[02:30:35.429 --> 02:30:41.610]  And so, going to current, she just had her second dose of the vaccine.
[02:30:41.610 --> 02:30:49.152]  She hasn't came out and said, like, they made us get it or else, but that's the sentiment that everybody feels, so everybody's just going along, get along.
[02:30:49.152 --> 02:30:50.732]  That's social pressure.
[02:30:50.732 --> 02:30:53.313]  And whenever she got the second vaccine,
[02:30:54.248 --> 02:30:57.009]  Um, you know, she had a hard time lifting up her arms.
[02:30:57.009 --> 02:30:59.350]  Like, she didn't have any kind of, like, paralysis.
[02:30:59.350 --> 02:31:09.233]  She can still move, but it made her complete, like, where she couldn't lift her arms up to even lift any weight up where her body hurts so much.
[02:31:09.233 --> 02:31:09.933]  That's insane, Andrew.
[02:31:09.933 --> 02:31:10.774]  We gotta jump.
[02:31:10.774 --> 02:31:12.134]  Thank you for your testimony.
[02:31:12.134 --> 02:31:13.274]  God bless you.
[02:31:13.274 --> 02:31:19.977]  All right, Dan in Florida says five celebrities that have died from vaccine, no one talks about it.
[02:31:19.977 --> 02:31:21.157]  Tell us the names that you've noticed.
[02:31:22.771 --> 02:31:23.793]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:31:23.793 --> 02:31:26.437]  I'll skip the pleasantries and just get right to it.
[02:31:26.437 --> 02:31:34.829]  There's been seven famous all-black people, healthy celebrities, to die in the past two months.
[02:31:34.829 --> 02:31:37.073]  We all know about Marvin Hagler and Hank Aaron.
[02:31:37.662 --> 02:31:47.750]  There is Vincent Jackson, the former Pro Bowl NFL wide receiver for the Buccaneers and Chargers, died at only 38 in his hotel room.
[02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:59.640]  Police said alcoholism and CTE could have played a role, but the family, as soon as that came out, released a statement disputing that, saying they don't speak for them.
[02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:06.546]  There is two sports journalists, Sekou Smith and Therese Paylor, both passed away
[02:32:07.199 --> 02:32:13.882]  In their late 30s, no listed causes of death, no follow-up reports in the months that have passed.
[02:32:13.882 --> 02:32:27.267]  And I actually am pretty sure I've been able to independently confirm that Therese Taylor was killed by the vaccine, because I tweeted this information the other day and included his name, and I get a like on it from a blue checkmark.
[02:32:27.267 --> 02:32:28.207]  I checked who she is.
[02:32:28.686 --> 02:32:30.127]  Her name's Ebony Reed.
[02:32:30.127 --> 02:32:39.276]  She's a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, and she was Perez Taylor's fiancée, and she's liking my tweet saying that the vaccine killed him.
[02:32:39.276 --> 02:32:46.462]  Then there's also Marion- Well, Hagler's friends and family said it, and then they got pressured, and then it's crazy.
[02:32:46.462 --> 02:32:53.569]  Then they lied and said that Frank- Hank Aaron died of natural causes, but now the family said no, it was the vaccine.
[02:32:55.586 --> 02:32:57.287]  Yeah, it's insane.
[02:32:57.287 --> 02:32:58.567]  They're covering all these up.
[02:32:58.567 --> 02:32:59.168]  I mean, who knows?
[02:32:59.168 --> 02:33:01.489]  The scary part is that these are all black people.
[02:33:01.489 --> 02:33:20.717]  We know Bill Gates really... Brother, they don't want me to say the names, and I'm going to leave it alone, but there was a black guy at my school that ended up going to play for UT, and he was married to another black lady that went to my school that I didn't know, but I knew him a little bit, and I heard they both died in the news of COVID, and I went and checked, and they'd just taken the vaccine.
[02:33:20.717 --> 02:33:21.577]  These are 47-year-old black people.
[02:33:23.661 --> 02:33:26.406]  And so yeah, that's why it's like Black Lives Matter on every channel.
[02:33:26.406 --> 02:33:27.367]  We love black people!
[02:33:27.367 --> 02:33:28.248]  We love blacks!
[02:33:28.248 --> 02:33:28.889]  We love blacks!
[02:33:28.889 --> 02:33:29.470]  We love blacks!
[02:33:29.470 --> 02:33:30.652]  We love... Oh gosh!
[02:33:30.652 --> 02:33:31.914]  Oh, Baljee loves blacks!
[02:33:31.914 --> 02:33:34.378]  Bill Gates wants blacks to have the shots first!
[02:33:34.378 --> 02:33:35.901]  And it's literally murdering them.
[02:33:35.901 --> 02:33:37.323]  I mean, you just can't make this up.
[02:33:39.451 --> 02:33:46.617]  Also, Marion Ramsey, who was in Police Academy, she died when the shots first started coming out in New York.
[02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:47.417]  She was 73.
[02:33:47.417 --> 02:33:50.359]  There's no listed cause of death, no follow-up report.
[02:33:50.359 --> 02:33:57.465]  Then this past week, the wide receiver, former NFL wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, his daughter died at only 25.
[02:33:57.465 --> 02:34:00.087]  There's no listed cause of death.
[02:34:00.646 --> 02:34:04.867]  No report, no...it's just all...nobody can...nobody knows anything.
[02:34:04.867 --> 02:34:08.809]  A 25-year-old dies who's famous, and there's no info on what happened?
[02:34:08.809 --> 02:34:12.530]  I mean, does that sound normal?
[02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:13.330]  Incredible, sir.
[02:34:13.330 --> 02:34:14.410]  I appreciate your call.
[02:34:14.410 --> 02:34:26.814]  Let's put that photo back up of Bill Gates giving the oral polio vaccine to the loving black baby he wants to take care of, and then type in, Bill Gates, polio vaccine caused polio, Reuters.
[02:34:26.814 --> 02:34:28.114]  Oh, thank you, Bill Gates.
[02:34:28.114 --> 02:34:30.235]  Here's some SV40 cancer virus for you.
[02:34:32.017 --> 02:34:32.397]  There it is.
[02:34:32.397 --> 02:34:37.403]  How the oral polio vaccine can cause polio.
[02:34:37.403 --> 02:34:38.264]  That's from a couple of years ago.
[02:34:38.264 --> 02:34:43.189]  The latest is actually last year.
[02:34:43.189 --> 02:34:51.217]  When we come back, we're going to go directly to Henry and then Granny Do-Right.
[02:34:52.515 --> 02:34:55.657]  And then Nathan, Mike, Josh, Jason, and everybody else.
[02:34:55.657 --> 02:34:58.538]  We're going to get to everybody here today.
[02:34:58.538 --> 02:35:00.579]  Stephen's active duty in Washington.
[02:35:00.579 --> 02:35:02.160]  Let's talk about what's come up with the COVID vaccines.
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:03.540]  We've heard from the military, not just the caller.
[02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:08.083]  I got other calls saying, yeah, they told the military, everybody's got to take it starting in July.
[02:35:08.083 --> 02:35:08.983]  Well, it's experimental.
[02:35:08.983 --> 02:35:10.324]  It's illegal.
[02:35:10.324 --> 02:35:11.784]  But see, they'll have enough people that have taken it.
[02:35:11.784 --> 02:35:13.625]  They're like, well, the people are taking it.
[02:35:13.625 --> 02:35:15.586]  You're taking it too.
[02:35:15.586 --> 02:35:19.268]  But they can't, under law, give the military experimental vaccines.
[02:35:19.983 --> 02:35:23.024]  They can order them to take other vaccines if they're, quote, approved by the FDA.
[02:35:23.024 --> 02:35:24.784]  That's still dangerous.
[02:35:24.784 --> 02:35:27.545]  But you talk about guinea pigs, that's all coming up.
[02:35:27.545 --> 02:35:37.768]  There's a bunch of breaking news on Infowars.com, a lot of their angles I haven't gotten to, but... And we've also got China and Russia, and how Biden fell down three times, getting on the airplane.
[02:35:37.768 --> 02:35:38.528]  That's all coming up.
[02:35:38.528 --> 02:35:48.831]  But I want to get through these calls first, and then we're going to shift gears, and we're going to get into the economy and Russia and China, and where all this humiliation is going.
[02:35:48.831 --> 02:35:49.211]  Stay with us.
[02:35:50.974 --> 02:35:55.177]  Alex Jones here with the new InfoWars sale and it is a fantastic sale.

[02:36:24.753 --> 02:36:28.394]  And it funds our operation.
[02:36:28.394 --> 02:36:30.275]  Plus, all of the Emirates Essentials.
[02:36:30.275 --> 02:36:35.197]  Essential oils, natural deodorants, shampoos, conditioners, a whole host of products.
[02:36:35.197 --> 02:36:38.038]  The entire Emirates Essentials line is close to selling out.
[02:36:38.038 --> 02:36:39.198]  We're coming in a few months.
[02:36:39.198 --> 02:36:44.940]  But despite that, right now, ladies and gentlemen, they're all 50% off as well, with free shipping.

[02:36:46.881 --> 02:36:49.122]  It's a huge savings, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:36:49.122 --> 02:36:49.282]  A 360 win.
[02:36:51.215 --> 02:36:54.963]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:36:54.963 --> 02:36:58.670]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:36:58.670 --> 02:37:01.276]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[02:37:01.940 --> 02:37:06.304]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:37:06.304 --> 02:37:12.070]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:23.682]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:37:24.282 --> 02:37:26.423]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:37:26.423 --> 02:37:30.545]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:37:30.545 --> 02:37:41.131]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarestore.com.
[02:37:41.131 --> 02:37:50.676]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[02:37:50.676 --> 02:37:51.336]  Thank you so much.
[02:37:52.981 --> 02:37:56.924]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[02:37:56.924 --> 02:37:59.565]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[02:37:59.565 --> 02:38:00.306]  Why do you do that?
[02:38:00.306 --> 02:38:03.248]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[02:38:03.248 --> 02:38:05.269]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[02:38:06.075 --> 02:38:14.862]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[02:38:14.862 --> 02:38:15.102]  Boom!
[02:38:15.102 --> 02:38:15.503]  We did it.
[02:38:15.503 --> 02:38:16.003]  It's popular.
[02:38:16.003 --> 02:38:16.764]  It's X3.
[02:38:16.764 --> 02:38:18.005]  Is it better than X2?
[02:38:18.005 --> 02:38:18.685]  You decide.
[02:38:18.685 --> 02:38:20.146]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[02:38:20.146 --> 02:38:24.290]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular Powdered Pill
[02:38:25.150 --> 02:38:27.332]  SleepAid, and that is down and out.
[02:38:27.332 --> 02:38:32.017]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.
[02:38:32.017 --> 02:38:39.203]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off, out of the gate, at InfoWareStore.com and free shipping.
[02:38:39.203 --> 02:38:43.607]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the InfoWare at the same time.
[02:38:43.607 --> 02:38:47.591]  Down and out, exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com for 40% off and free shipping.
[02:38:54.201 --> 02:39:08.901]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[02:39:09.601 --> 02:39:17.786]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[02:39:17.786 --> 02:39:34.435]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[02:39:34.435 --> 02:39:37.877]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[02:39:38.457 --> 02:39:46.845]  So don't worship the globalists, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God, because we're made by God.
[02:39:46.845 --> 02:39:55.032]  And appreciate your consciousness, and appreciate free speech, while you still have it, while you still have it.
[02:39:55.032 --> 02:39:57.675]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:06.707 --> 02:40:09.087]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:40:09.087 --> 02:40:11.728]  And I'm telling you, my TV viewer, the video is incredible.
[02:40:11.728 --> 02:40:12.748]  Joe Biden falling down.
[02:40:12.748 --> 02:40:16.169]  Not once, not twice, but three times.
[02:40:16.169 --> 02:40:20.171]  Scrabbling like a dying cat on a hot tin roof.
[02:40:20.171 --> 02:40:29.033]  I mean, this is emblematic at every level of globalism and where our civilization and where our society is.
[02:40:29.033 --> 02:40:31.254]  And how, yeah, careful what you wish for.
[02:40:31.254 --> 02:40:32.514]  They installed this puppet.
[02:40:34.191 --> 02:40:36.945]  And now China is in our face at events saying we're a joke.
[02:40:36.945 --> 02:40:37.549]  Russia is.
[02:40:38.422 --> 02:40:43.126]  And Biden just responds by empty threats to people, but then is scared to be part of debates.
[02:40:43.126 --> 02:40:44.027]  It's incredible.
[02:40:44.027 --> 02:40:45.468]  All right, we've got a lot of amazing calls.
[02:40:45.468 --> 02:40:49.471]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[02:40:49.471 --> 02:40:59.880]  We are taking calls from people to give us your take on the so-called vaccines, your take on the mRNA vaccines, your take on the virus vector vaccines of AstraZeneca and, of course, Johnson & Johnson.
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:04.044]  What's your view on all this and how they're trying to cover up the massive side effects
[02:41:04.881 --> 02:41:08.442]  I want to get to a bunch of calls this segment because they've all got incredible points.
[02:41:08.442 --> 02:41:09.802]  Henry in Chicago.
[02:41:09.802 --> 02:41:10.142]  Go ahead.
[02:41:10.142 --> 02:41:10.642]  You're on the air.
[02:41:10.642 --> 02:41:12.663]  Hi Alex.
[02:41:12.663 --> 02:41:13.763]  Thanks for taking my phone call.
[02:41:13.763 --> 02:41:14.623]  I love your products.
[02:41:14.623 --> 02:41:18.364]  I love the DNA Force and your Alexa water purification system.
[02:41:18.364 --> 02:41:19.204]  They're great.
[02:41:19.204 --> 02:41:25.286]  Now, my point is we need to make people aware to protect us against this globalist.
[02:41:25.286 --> 02:41:29.567]  There's a first court case against a mandatory vaccination file in New Mexico.
[02:41:30.362 --> 02:41:36.363]  By attorney Anna Gardner on behalf of a county employee where they want to make it mandatory.
[02:41:36.363 --> 02:41:41.904]  Now, there's another doctor who's suing the mandate of the emergency.
[02:41:41.904 --> 02:41:50.006]  Her name is Dr. Pam Popper, which they want to start the mandatory vaccines because they're going to enforce the passport.
[02:41:50.006 --> 02:41:51.746]  That's a violation of our rights.
[02:41:51.746 --> 02:41:56.427]  And we are under attack as Americans, and we need to defend our country.
[02:41:57.237 --> 02:41:58.859]  He never stripped the immunity from Big Tech.
[02:42:23.269 --> 02:42:27.693]  He implemented the red flag for the second amendment.
[02:42:27.693 --> 02:42:28.754]  I think he betrayed us.
[02:42:28.754 --> 02:42:33.119]  I mean, I was Trump supporter, but now I will not vote for him because he threw us under the bus.
[02:42:34.531 --> 02:42:36.133]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:42:36.133 --> 02:42:37.634]  At his rallies, he didn't wear a mask.
[02:42:37.634 --> 02:42:38.354]  He encouraged it.
[02:42:38.354 --> 02:42:39.515]  He tried to have it both ways.
[02:42:39.515 --> 02:42:40.716]  He was overwhelmed.
[02:42:40.716 --> 02:42:43.398]  I think Trump overall is a good guy, but I hear you.
[02:42:43.398 --> 02:42:57.068]  Criticism of him is completely reasonable and is good, so that if it's going to be the party of Trump going forward, better than the party of the neocons or rhinos, we need to make sure that Trump is basically singing to our sheet of music.
[02:42:57.068 --> 02:42:59.470]  And so it's important to criticize Trump, and we've done that.
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:00.941]  And I've done that.
[02:43:00.941 --> 02:43:08.105]  We also need to then just move on now, because a lot of folks just want to keep bashing Trump, because it keeps them on Twitter, it keeps them on Facebook as conservatives.
[02:43:08.105 --> 02:43:12.188]  We need to move on to going after who the current puppet is, and that's Joe Biden.
[02:43:12.188 --> 02:43:12.888]  God bless you, sir.
[02:43:12.888 --> 02:43:13.709]  I appreciate your call.
[02:43:13.709 --> 02:43:14.890]  Thank you, Henry.
[02:43:14.890 --> 02:43:16.431]  All right, let's move quick here.
[02:43:16.431 --> 02:43:19.873]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Texas.
[02:43:19.873 --> 02:43:20.914]  Says he's a doctor.
[02:43:20.914 --> 02:43:23.715]  He wants to comment on this whole situation.
[02:43:23.715 --> 02:43:24.436]  Thanks for calling, sir.
[02:43:26.170 --> 02:43:31.532]  Alex, a few minutes ago you kind of shot from the hip giving advice to one of your callers.
[02:43:31.532 --> 02:43:37.494]  I think his father was ailing from post-vaccine problems.
[02:43:37.494 --> 02:43:40.175]  You mentioned Benadryl.
[02:43:40.175 --> 02:43:43.156]  Benadryl has nothing to do with inflammation.
[02:43:43.156 --> 02:43:50.879]  It does in a very abstract sense, but what he wants to get his father on is some kind of steroids.
[02:43:50.879 --> 02:43:51.659]  I think there are inhaled
[02:43:53.607 --> 02:43:53.887]  I'm good.
[02:44:00.809 --> 02:44:01.850]  Sure, and I'm no doctor.
[02:44:01.850 --> 02:44:06.874]  I did see that big emergency room head doctor in North Texas.
[02:44:06.874 --> 02:44:08.055]  It was Northwest Texas.
[02:44:08.055 --> 02:44:11.397]  He said that he's given it to hundreds of people, the inhalable steroid.
[02:44:11.397 --> 02:44:12.999]  It knocked it out within hours.
[02:44:12.999 --> 02:44:14.720]  And so that's why I said steroid in general.
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:20.645]  I just know that when I'm having an allergic response or I've got like a rash or I've got inflammation, I take Benadryl.
[02:44:20.645 --> 02:44:23.667]  So I was just guessing that that might begin.
[02:44:23.667 --> 02:44:24.347]  I'm not a doctor.
[02:44:24.347 --> 02:44:24.888]  I was just saying
[02:44:25.628 --> 02:44:28.531]  It just seems like they should tell people, go after inflammation.
[02:44:28.531 --> 02:44:30.853]  So you're saying as a doctor, steroids is the answer.
[02:44:30.853 --> 02:44:33.236]  Tell us about that.
[02:44:33.236 --> 02:44:34.797]  Yeah, steroids.
[02:44:34.797 --> 02:44:36.899]  I mean, that's your body's defense.
[02:44:36.899 --> 02:44:42.484]  Your adrenal gland pumps out corticosteroids naturally to help fight inflammation.
[02:44:42.484 --> 02:44:50.312]  It also is synthesized and released in response to stress.
[02:44:53.005 --> 02:44:55.686]  Benadryl is good for sleep.
[02:44:55.686 --> 02:44:59.388]  I use it occasionally when I'm having sleep issues.
[02:44:59.388 --> 02:45:00.429]  I said I'm not a doctor.
[02:45:00.429 --> 02:45:02.750]  I was just throwing out what I do when I'm having an allergic response.
[02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:05.452]  Benadryl liquid seems to work for me.
[02:45:05.452 --> 02:45:07.893]  But that just shows I don't have a medical degree.
[02:45:07.893 --> 02:45:11.395]  But I have seen in the news they say steroid inhalers have been really successful.
[02:45:11.395 --> 02:45:13.156]  And then I saw Fauci try to shut that down.
[02:45:14.381 --> 02:45:24.127]  Yeah, I saw an interview with that West Texas ER doc who was using it for several hundred patients and with great success.
[02:45:24.127 --> 02:45:25.688]  What does this sound like to you?
[02:45:25.688 --> 02:45:26.789]  His dad takes it.
[02:45:26.789 --> 02:45:28.630]  They have studies that say it causes brain fog.
[02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:40.838]  What would you do, not treating anything over the phone here, but I mean, if that was your dad and he had brain fog and was basically in another world after a vaccine, what would you do?
[02:45:42.585 --> 02:45:43.646]  I've been thinking about this a lot.
[02:45:43.646 --> 02:45:57.721]  I've got a brother of a brother-in-law who, he's a nurse, and he ended up with, he picked up the virus and was in the hospital for a couple days and he decided to take the vaccine.
[02:45:57.721 --> 02:46:04.788]  And I'm thinking, you know, down the road when he does develop problems, you know, is there anything I can recommend?
[02:46:06.533 --> 02:46:20.181]  Just as I told you, I think steroids, you know, you can prescribe them and get the higher doses, but, you know, you take it as an inhaled preparation, even over-the-counter.
[02:46:20.181 --> 02:46:21.422]  Well, sir, I'm no doctor.
[02:46:21.422 --> 02:46:27.826]  I've just read the literature that says a lot of the brain fog is caused by an autoimmune response and swelling in the brain.
[02:46:27.826 --> 02:46:32.889]  So, it seems to be common sense then, if you take steroids to deal with swelling, that steroids might help.
[02:46:34.889 --> 02:46:35.869]  Exactly.
[02:46:35.869 --> 02:46:43.512]  And the steroids, like any other gas, can easily access your bloodstream through the lungs.
[02:46:43.512 --> 02:46:45.952]  You know, any marijuana smoker knows this.
[02:46:45.952 --> 02:46:50.473]  It's an easy way to get things into your bloodstream, kind of bypass some barriers.
[02:46:50.473 --> 02:46:52.514]  By the way, I recognize your voice.
[02:46:52.514 --> 02:46:53.214]  You're a doctor.
[02:46:53.214 --> 02:46:56.575]  You used to live in, like, Wyoming or Montana or something.
[02:46:56.575 --> 02:46:59.276]  You've been calling about 20 years, haven't you?
[02:46:59.276 --> 02:47:01.116]  Yeah, I have.
[02:47:01.116 --> 02:47:02.917]  You haven't gotten on in about 5, 6, 7 years, have you?
[02:47:05.141 --> 02:47:06.362]  It ain't so easy anymore.
[02:47:06.362 --> 02:47:09.665]  You're a victim of your own popularity, Alex.
[02:47:09.665 --> 02:47:12.687]  So, did you move to Texas, Mike?
[02:47:12.687 --> 02:47:15.088]  Yeah, my wife's got family here.
[02:47:15.088 --> 02:47:15.949]  God knows I wouldn't be here.
[02:47:15.949 --> 02:47:16.309]  I understand.
[02:47:16.309 --> 02:47:19.952]  So, was it Montana or Wyoming you used to live in?
[02:47:19.952 --> 02:47:25.936]  I trained in Arizona, and I practiced in Wyoming for about 11 years.
[02:47:25.936 --> 02:47:26.316]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:26.316 --> 02:47:29.959]  Well, you first called in 20 years ago from Arizona, and then you lived in Wyoming.
[02:47:29.959 --> 02:47:32.080]  See, I remember you, don't I?
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:32.541]  You sure do.
[02:47:35.288 --> 02:47:36.348]  You'll have bad memory.
[02:47:36.348 --> 02:47:37.408]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:47:37.408 --> 02:47:40.610]  What do you make of what Gates... This is so reckless.
[02:47:40.610 --> 02:47:42.210]  So I know vaccines are a real technology.
[02:47:42.210 --> 02:47:43.591]  They can get tainted at problems.
[02:47:43.591 --> 02:47:45.051]  But what the hell are they doing here?
[02:47:45.051 --> 02:47:47.472]  This sounds like Bill Gates is being self-destructive.
[02:47:47.472 --> 02:47:48.893]  How's he going to get away with all this?
[02:47:48.893 --> 02:47:54.875]  I mean, I know people personally that have died after taking the shot.
[02:47:54.875 --> 02:47:55.395]  I don't know.
[02:47:55.395 --> 02:48:01.978]  These people are... The reckless behavior... The whole nature of this program...
[02:48:02.659 --> 02:48:08.160]  Sure, and won't this discredit future legitimate gene therapies, what they're doing?
[02:48:31.901 --> 02:48:37.126]  Well, probably not, because they haven't even labeled it properly.
[02:48:37.126 --> 02:48:39.108]  They're calling it a vaccine.
[02:48:39.108 --> 02:48:46.394]  So when they do come out with real therapies, people will think it's the first thing on the market.
[02:48:46.394 --> 02:48:47.215]  They've never seen it before.
[02:48:50.811 --> 02:48:51.332]  All right, brother.
[02:48:51.332 --> 02:48:55.715]  Well, I said I wanted to interview you 15 years ago as a guest and like six, seven years ago, last time you got on.
[02:48:55.715 --> 02:49:00.700]  But join us as a guest for 10 minutes tomorrow when I host the show, if you can.
[02:49:00.700 --> 02:49:02.861]  I'm going to tape from noon to two.
[02:49:02.861 --> 02:49:05.063]  We're going to air it four to six tomorrow.
[02:49:05.063 --> 02:49:09.267]  But if you want to pop on for 10 minutes and give us your knowledge on this, we'd love to talk to you tomorrow.
[02:49:09.267 --> 02:49:10.048]  Thank you.
[02:49:10.048 --> 02:49:16.834]  Yeah, folks, I recognize our callers and a lot of the old original callers.
[02:49:16.834 --> 02:49:17.594]  We always have a lot of callers.
[02:49:17.594 --> 02:49:18.395]  The show's always been big.
[02:49:19.091 --> 02:49:23.814]  But, you know, now when we open the phones up, we have a computer in there.
[02:49:23.814 --> 02:49:29.618]  We have had 24,000 requests during one show before.
[02:49:29.618 --> 02:49:37.723]  Now, granted, that's some of the same people calling back in, but Rush Limbaugh, I've talked to some of his people that work for him, Rush would get a couple thousand requests on his show.
[02:49:37.723 --> 02:49:38.583]  24,000 requests.
[02:49:42.771 --> 02:49:46.733]  That's why Carlos has been calling in 15 years out of Canada.
[02:49:46.733 --> 02:49:50.495]  He's a big heavy hitter, big guy in government and everything.
[02:49:50.495 --> 02:49:52.656]  I don't know how, he must have that sucker on speed dial, man.
[02:49:52.656 --> 02:49:58.319]  Because he gets in routinely, but everybody else, they used to get in, they can't get in, so I really miss talking to folks.
[02:49:58.319 --> 02:49:59.040]  Good talking to Mike.
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:01.161]  I want Mike on for 10 minutes as a guest tomorrow.
[02:50:01.161 --> 02:50:05.423]  And pick a few other of the callers, I'll tell you their names and numbers as kind of guest hosts.
[02:50:05.423 --> 02:50:08.264]  I'm going to definitely start doing that more as I said I would.
[02:50:08.264 --> 02:50:09.385]  Always better late than never.
[02:50:10.780 --> 02:50:12.761]  Wow, hour number four straight ahead.
[02:50:12.761 --> 02:50:19.384]  I'm going to finish up with all these callers that are patiently holding, and then I'm going to shift gears into the designed destruction of the U.S.
[02:50:19.384 --> 02:50:24.267]  and Biden falling down, and the Chinese rebuking him as a weak nothing, as they own him.
[02:50:24.267 --> 02:50:26.147]  I mean, it's just total humiliation.
[02:50:26.147 --> 02:50:29.129]  But don't let their humiliation work, and then it backfires.
[02:50:29.129 --> 02:50:31.230]  I'm going to talk about the PSYOP going on right now.
[02:50:31.230 --> 02:50:32.250]  They're trying to break our will.
[02:50:32.250 --> 02:50:35.772]  It's not going to happen, and it's going to backfire on them.
[02:50:35.772 --> 02:50:37.473]  But these murderers can't help themselves.
[02:50:40.959 --> 02:50:48.888]  Emerix Essentials is all-natural, all-organic, high-end, quality, clean, self-care products.
[02:50:48.888 --> 02:50:56.596]  And they are 50% off right now at infowarestore.com with free shipping for a limited time.

[02:51:01.698 --> 02:51:09.880]  That's all of these high-end super pure quality essential oils and basically every popular set that's out there.
[02:51:09.880 --> 02:51:13.021]  Then of course we have the natural shampoo, organic.
[02:51:13.021 --> 02:51:14.501]  We also have the body wash.

[02:51:20.903 --> 02:51:26.324]  50% off and free shipping part of our big blowout sale that's taking place right now.
[02:51:26.324 --> 02:51:27.044]  We also have
[02:51:28.036 --> 02:51:33.138]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[02:51:33.138 --> 02:51:38.380]  Even before I had an access TV show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun.
[02:51:57.717 --> 02:52:02.782]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[02:52:02.782 --> 02:52:04.604]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[02:52:07.479 --> 02:52:08.560]  We're not worthy!
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:12.543]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you.
[02:52:12.543 --> 02:52:14.525]  Because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[02:52:14.525 --> 02:52:15.926]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[02:52:15.926 --> 02:52:17.967]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[02:52:17.967 --> 02:52:19.629]  The globalists love lying to you.
[02:52:19.629 --> 02:52:20.970]  They love manipulating you.
[02:52:20.970 --> 02:52:23.712]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[02:52:23.712 --> 02:52:28.296]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[02:52:28.296 --> 02:52:30.638]  That, for me, is really satanic.
[02:52:30.638 --> 02:52:31.218]  And disgusting.
[02:52:31.218 --> 02:52:34.041]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew
[02:52:35.678 --> 02:52:37.539]  We will never join the Globals.
[02:52:37.539 --> 02:52:39.621]  We will never knowingly manipulate you.
[02:52:39.621 --> 02:52:45.064]  Because we know we're all in this together.
[02:52:45.064 --> 02:52:47.686]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:07.543 --> 02:53:09.623]  That was a blast from the past, talking to Mike.
[02:53:09.623 --> 02:53:14.464]  I never forget, though.
[02:53:14.464 --> 02:53:17.025]  Somebody's got a distinctive voice.
[02:53:17.025 --> 02:53:25.727]  All right, we've got loaded phone lines here, and it's incredible taking your calls with the vaccines and all the knowledge that's coming out.
[02:53:25.727 --> 02:53:28.467]  But I do need to shift gears into the strategic plan to bring the U.S.
[02:53:28.467 --> 02:53:33.608]  down, because I don't say this with any enjoyment.
[02:53:33.608 --> 02:53:34.629]  I'm very upset about this.
[02:53:34.629 --> 02:53:36.549]  I love America, because it's an idea.
[02:53:37.535 --> 02:53:38.076]  It's a dream.
[02:53:38.076 --> 02:53:40.197]  What we dream, we can manifest.
[02:53:40.197 --> 02:53:49.064]  But if you're not honest about how much trouble this country's in, how much trouble Texas is in, because I love Texas, and Texas is on its last legs right now.
[02:53:49.064 --> 02:53:51.926]  We can turn that around, but not much longer.
[02:53:51.926 --> 02:53:56.470]  And so I'm going to tell it like it is coming up, and how emblematic it is.
[02:53:56.470 --> 02:54:04.336]  Biden falling down, not once, not twice, but three times while shooting his mouth off about how he's going to kick everybody's ass, and he's going to show the Russians and all the rest of it.
[02:54:04.336 --> 02:54:06.217]  Yeah, just like Napoleon and just like Hitler, right?
[02:54:06.217 --> 02:54:07.198]  You're going to show them now?
[02:54:08.678 --> 02:54:11.459]  It just never ends, man.
[02:54:11.459 --> 02:54:13.640]  But they were able to take the Russians over with a fake revolution.
[02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:16.001]  That's what they're trying to do to us right now.
[02:54:16.001 --> 02:54:21.943]  And so we should be rooting for the Russians and rooting for ourselves and rooting for the downfall of the left and their satanic garbage.
[02:54:21.943 --> 02:54:26.525]  But right now, let's go ahead and take another phone call.
[02:54:26.525 --> 02:54:29.226]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:54:29.226 --> 02:54:31.107]  That would be Granny Do-Right.
[02:54:31.107 --> 02:54:31.927]  Granny Do-Right.
[02:54:31.927 --> 02:54:33.048]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:54:33.048 --> 02:54:33.388]  Go ahead.
[02:54:36.317 --> 02:54:38.918]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[02:54:38.918 --> 02:54:52.542]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[02:54:52.542 --> 02:55:00.505]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[02:55:00.505 --> 02:55:01.445]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[02:55:04.654 --> 02:55:08.326]  Well, let's take some time on this because I'm the worst at forgetting to take my supplements.
[02:55:09.036 --> 02:55:13.718]  And when I do take the fish oil, I do take the X2, my skin, my hair, my brain, everything is so much better.
[02:55:13.718 --> 02:55:19.281]  But Dr. Group, when he first said, you need medical grade iodine, we have a DEA license, nobody else has it.
[02:55:19.281 --> 02:55:20.782]  I'm like, oh yeah, right, iodine.
[02:55:20.782 --> 02:55:23.043]  He said, no, no, no, not the stuff at the store that'll kill you.
[02:55:23.043 --> 02:55:24.344]  This is real iodine.
[02:55:24.344 --> 02:55:27.585]  And I had these sunspots already because I'm a big outdoorsman.
[02:55:27.585 --> 02:55:29.486]  The sunspots went away.
[02:55:29.486 --> 02:55:33.348]  I still have a few freckles, but the sunspots went away within two months.
[02:55:33.348 --> 02:55:34.129]  So start over.
[02:55:34.129 --> 02:55:34.909]  Tell us what happened.
[02:55:36.818 --> 02:55:58.106]  Well, I just noticed that I had heard you talking, this was a few years back, to, I can't remember the doctor's name, and you were commenting on how his skin was flawless, that he was a real advocate for iodine.
[02:55:58.106 --> 02:56:03.488]  And not Dr. Group, I'm talking about an older gentleman, I think probably he was 75 at the time.
[02:56:03.488 --> 02:56:05.569]  Oh, that was Dr. Wally.
[02:56:06.829 --> 02:56:09.970]  Yes, yes.
[02:56:09.970 --> 02:56:12.211]  And so I thought, oh.
[02:56:12.211 --> 02:56:12.871]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:56:12.871 --> 02:56:15.732]  Wallet looked like when he was 79 years old, he looked like he was about 56.
[02:56:15.732 --> 02:56:17.293]  Yeah.
[02:56:17.293 --> 02:56:18.593]  Correct.
[02:56:18.593 --> 02:56:27.697]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[02:56:27.697 --> 02:56:35.840]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, OK,
[02:56:37.113 --> 02:56:38.613]  You know, this is a ticket.
[02:56:38.613 --> 02:56:39.434]  This is working.
[02:56:39.434 --> 02:56:40.394]  This is wonderful.
[02:56:40.394 --> 02:56:45.735]  You know, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[02:56:45.735 --> 02:56:53.777]  So, anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[02:56:53.777 --> 02:56:55.317]  Well, I appreciate your testimony.
[02:56:55.317 --> 02:56:56.197]  I don't want to cut you short.
[02:56:56.197 --> 02:56:57.017]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:56:57.017 --> 02:56:57.937]  Granny, do it right.
[02:56:57.937 --> 02:56:58.378]  One minute.
[02:56:58.378 --> 02:56:59.578]  Just wait one more minute.
[02:56:59.578 --> 02:57:00.698]  I'm going to get some patients to join us.
[02:57:00.698 --> 02:57:01.258]  We're going to come back.
[02:57:01.258 --> 02:57:03.499]  You can talk about family has taken the vaccines.
[02:57:03.499 --> 02:57:04.979]  Want to randomly hear what you have to say there.
[02:57:06.238 --> 02:57:10.961]  And then Nathan, let's talk about what happened to a family member and the side effects.
[02:57:10.961 --> 02:57:13.043]  And then we're going to talk to Josh, Steven, and Clarence.
[02:57:13.043 --> 02:57:14.824]  And then that's it for those calls.
[02:57:14.824 --> 02:57:16.906]  We're going to clear the board off.
[02:57:16.906 --> 02:57:23.350]  And I'm going to open the phones up, specifically in the time we have left, on what do you make of Joe Biden falling down three times?
[02:57:23.350 --> 02:57:25.152]  What do you make of him starting a fight with Russia?
[02:57:25.152 --> 02:57:25.652]  No U.S.
[02:57:25.652 --> 02:57:26.032]  presence.
[02:57:26.032 --> 02:57:27.833]  Like, they'll pay soon.
[02:57:27.833 --> 02:57:28.574]  They'll find out.
[02:57:28.574 --> 02:57:31.516]  Well, we're going to, you know, he's a murderer.
[02:57:31.516 --> 02:57:34.118]  I mean, it's just crazy dementia.
[02:57:34.904 --> 02:57:40.634]  I've never heard of something in history where you've got some like crazy, demented person.
[02:57:40.634 --> 02:57:42.517]  It's all just God cursing us.
[02:57:42.517 --> 02:57:45.382]  I mean, just give me a break, man.
[02:57:45.382 --> 02:57:47.045]  He should be in a nursing home in a wheelchair.
[02:57:50.155 --> 02:57:53.758]  Humanity has been domesticated, by and large.
[02:57:53.758 --> 02:57:58.302]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all gonna pass.
[02:57:58.302 --> 02:58:07.529]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[02:58:07.529 --> 02:58:11.652]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[02:58:11.972 --> 02:58:30.103]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us, under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[02:58:30.103 --> 02:58:38.708]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns
[02:58:39.208 --> 02:58:45.942]  That the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[02:58:45.942 --> 02:58:49.349]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[02:59:19.432 --> 02:59:24.898]  We're now into hour number four on the program that's not supposed to exist, not supposed to be on air.
[02:59:24.898 --> 02:59:29.803]  The most censored, the most lied about, the most demonized broadcast in the world, and I am blessed to be here.
[02:59:31.989 --> 02:59:36.831]  Yes, you know, we're talking about folks that take the supplements and then make them look younger, make them look elder.
[02:59:36.831 --> 02:59:40.532]  People say, well, Jones, you look like you're about 55, not 47.
[02:59:40.532 --> 02:59:43.893]  Well, let me tell you, when I was 12, I was dating girls that were 16.
[02:59:43.893 --> 02:59:46.453]  When I was 16, I was dating 25-year-old women.
[02:59:46.453 --> 02:59:47.754]  I'm not bragging, it's just true.
[02:59:47.754 --> 02:59:51.375]  I was the guy they always sent to get beer because they'd sell me beer because I looked older.
[02:59:51.375 --> 02:59:54.516]  That's just the way I've always been.
[02:59:54.516 --> 02:59:57.017]  I mean, I was living like a man by the time I was 12.
[02:59:57.017 --> 03:00:00.938]  So, who knows how long I'll be living, but I've been burning the candle at both ends from the start.
[03:00:02.031 --> 03:00:04.352]  And that's just the way it is.
[03:00:04.352 --> 03:00:07.013]  So I wanted to drive cars.
[03:00:07.013 --> 03:00:07.954]  I wanted to date women.
[03:00:07.954 --> 03:00:09.555]  I wanted to kick ass.
[03:00:09.555 --> 03:00:11.135]  And that's just what I did.
[03:00:11.135 --> 03:00:13.957]  And here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:13.957 --> 03:00:17.338]  Here we are together in this fight, and I'm honored to be here.
[03:00:17.338 --> 03:00:19.960]  But Granny Do-Right in Kentucky, go ahead.
[03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:21.801]  You wanted to talk about your family's taking the vaccine.
[03:00:21.801 --> 03:00:24.182]  Give us your take on it.
[03:00:24.182 --> 03:00:24.882]  Oh, yeah.
[03:00:24.882 --> 03:00:29.684]  Much to my... I don't even know what to say.
[03:00:31.266 --> 03:00:33.448]  My sister was the first one.
[03:00:33.448 --> 03:00:46.660]  I told them years ago, last year, sorry, when it first happened, I was like, yeah, and they'll come out with a vaccine to cure this, except it won't be a vaccine and it won't be anything you're going to want to take.
[03:00:46.660 --> 03:00:52.745]  And here we are a year later, and I had told my sister, you're not taking this, are you?
[03:00:52.745 --> 03:00:54.547]  She's like, oh, I'm not stupid.
[03:00:54.547 --> 03:00:55.328]  Of course I am.
[03:00:55.328 --> 03:00:57.770]  I'm like, what?
[03:00:58.917 --> 03:01:01.118]  And sent her information again.
[03:01:01.118 --> 03:01:11.660]  Sent my brother-in-law, who almost, I guess, I really made him mad because he said, don't text me any more information.
[03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:21.522]  And my nieces and nephews, who I sent all the information to, I had one text me back, oh, I'm taking the J&J tomorrow.
[03:01:21.522 --> 03:01:24.323]  And I was like, well, yikes!
[03:01:24.323 --> 03:01:27.744]  Like, rethink that one and send them more information.
[03:01:28.971 --> 03:01:35.534]  I mean, I'm pulling my hair out because it's like it almost doesn't matter what you say, the information you send.
[03:01:35.534 --> 03:01:48.339]  My sister-in-law took hers, my other nephew took his, and it's gotten to the point where, like, I'm throwing my hands up in the air, like, what do I have to do to convince these people?
[03:01:48.339 --> 03:01:54.302]  They have been so thoroughly, thoroughly embedded and brainwashed in the system, it's just
[03:01:55.009 --> 03:01:55.890]  Unbelievable to me.
[03:01:55.890 --> 03:01:59.952]  Well, the good news is around half the public in polls say they're not taking it.
[03:01:59.952 --> 03:02:03.115]  And in certain families people are buying into the system and others are not.
[03:02:03.115 --> 03:02:05.837]  They all do it because they want to be a hero and save others.
[03:02:05.837 --> 03:02:08.518]  So it's like something they can do as a rite of passage.
[03:02:08.518 --> 03:02:16.304]  They can go, these are big pharma with their history of secret experimentation and show them all the different scientists that have come out and said this is dangerous.
[03:02:16.304 --> 03:02:18.725]  And just do your job warning them and move on.
[03:02:18.725 --> 03:02:20.086]  God bless you, Granny.
[03:02:20.086 --> 03:02:20.867]  And that's all you can do.
[03:02:21.741 --> 03:02:27.304]  But I guarantee you, a lot of them are going to get sick down the road from this and they're going to remember.
[03:02:27.304 --> 03:02:33.208]  But the biggest group we know, just go off the British Ministry of Defense that's running the program, is above 75.
[03:02:33.208 --> 03:02:36.490]  Do not take the mRNA vaccine if you're above 75.
[03:02:36.490 --> 03:02:39.171]  If you're pregnant, don't take it.
[03:02:39.171 --> 03:02:40.252]  It's causing miscarriages.
[03:02:40.252 --> 03:02:46.775]  But, you know, I see these doctors, I've seen a couple of them that took the vaccine and lost their babies.
[03:02:46.775 --> 03:02:48.877]  They go, I'd do it again, it wasn't the vaccine.
[03:02:49.952 --> 03:02:51.693]  They get into the sin.
[03:02:51.693 --> 03:02:53.255]  They get into hurting themselves.
[03:02:53.255 --> 03:02:55.896]  They get into the Stockholm Syndrome.
[03:02:55.896 --> 03:03:00.940]  Because if they admit that they're being lied to, well, they've got to admit the whole system's a fraud.
[03:03:00.940 --> 03:03:04.963]  So they pretend like they're the establishment when they're not.
[03:03:04.963 --> 03:03:09.046]  But I'll tell you this, if you're above 75, run from the vaccine.
[03:03:09.046 --> 03:03:10.267]  I wouldn't take a period.
[03:03:10.267 --> 03:03:11.168]  And man, if you're black,
[03:03:13.118 --> 03:03:17.660]  I love the headlines, like, Black people don't trust it because they're uneducated, Biden said.
[03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:22.981]  No, I think they've been pretty educated by drugs being shipped in their neighborhoods and being given syphilis and the rest of it.
[03:03:22.981 --> 03:03:28.643]  I think, I think you little virtue signalers that tell blacks how much they love them all day.
[03:03:28.643 --> 03:03:30.244]  I just love you.
[03:03:30.244 --> 03:03:31.584]  Oh, you poor thing.
[03:03:31.584 --> 03:03:32.865]  I'm going to tell you how to live your life.
[03:03:32.865 --> 03:03:35.466]  And I got a shot for you, Bill Gates does.
[03:03:35.466 --> 03:03:39.927]  Meanwhile, he's in articles 10 years ago saying we need to depopulate Africa.
[03:03:39.927 --> 03:03:41.768]  He wants to depopulate black people.
[03:03:43.119 --> 03:03:44.641]  Oh, but he loves you.
[03:03:44.641 --> 03:03:48.744]  I mean, that's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[03:03:48.744 --> 03:03:53.448]  But, see, wanting to depopulate blacks is loving.
[03:03:53.448 --> 03:03:57.512]  But a microaggression is bad.
[03:03:57.512 --> 03:03:58.853]  Unbelievable.
[03:03:58.853 --> 03:04:01.676]  All right, let's go to the next caller here.
[03:04:01.676 --> 03:04:04.919]  Let's talk to Nathan in Canada.
[03:04:04.919 --> 03:04:05.659]  Thank you for holding.
[03:04:05.659 --> 03:04:06.019]  Go ahead.
[03:04:06.019 --> 03:04:08.562]  Hello.
[03:04:08.562 --> 03:04:08.802]  Yes, sir.
[03:04:09.707 --> 03:04:11.008]  Hey, Alex!
[03:04:11.008 --> 03:04:18.434]  I'm a first-time caller calling from Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.
[03:04:18.434 --> 03:04:26.081]  My uncle's sister and her husband went and got the vaccine probably about two or three days ago, and they've started getting symptoms.
[03:04:26.081 --> 03:04:30.464]  They say that's worse than the regular seasonal flu.
[03:04:31.587 --> 03:04:35.048]  You know, they've been vomiting a couple times.
[03:04:35.048 --> 03:04:38.389]  They've just been feeling, like, really poor.
[03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:41.809]  Like, they're all over the place.
[03:04:41.809 --> 03:04:43.450]  It's not looking really good.
[03:04:43.450 --> 03:05:01.054]  And on top of that, one of my aunts has Hodgkin's lymphoma of the lungs, cancer of the lungs, and she's in the hospital, and they're trying to force the vaccine on her, which, undoubtedly, would honestly probably kill her.
[03:05:01.687 --> 03:05:06.371]  Oh, they admit if you have cancer, don't take it, because it can inflame the cancer.
[03:05:06.371 --> 03:05:07.072]  Wow!
[03:05:07.072 --> 03:05:08.473]  But notice they just still push it.
[03:05:08.473 --> 03:05:09.895]  That is insane.
[03:05:09.895 --> 03:05:12.157]  Wow, so they're trying to kill her, huh?
[03:05:12.157 --> 03:05:12.717]  Exactly.
[03:05:12.717 --> 03:05:17.481]  I mean, she's not in the greatest health of all.
[03:05:17.481 --> 03:05:20.164]  Well, these hospitals have become death factories, brother.
[03:05:20.164 --> 03:05:21.765]  What should we do, Nathan?
[03:05:21.765 --> 03:05:25.689]  Honestly, we need to get the word out.
[03:05:28.758 --> 03:05:29.258]  I agree with you.
[03:05:29.258 --> 03:05:31.118]  I want everybody to know, Nathan, what you held to do.
[03:05:31.118 --> 03:05:31.599]  We love you.
[03:05:31.599 --> 03:05:32.739]  Your phone cut out there.
[03:05:32.739 --> 03:05:36.859]  All right, let's talk to Active Duty Army on COVID vaccines.
[03:05:36.859 --> 03:05:37.680]  Mandatory soon.
[03:05:37.680 --> 03:05:39.620]  That's what a caller said yesterday.
[03:05:39.620 --> 03:05:44.221]  I made some calls, and yeah, the military is being told mandatory by late summer.
[03:05:44.221 --> 03:05:48.682]  Let's go ahead and go to Steven in Washington State.
[03:05:48.682 --> 03:05:51.782]  Active Duty Army, give us your take on this, please.
[03:05:51.782 --> 03:05:53.842]  Alex, first-time caller, long-time listener.
[03:05:53.842 --> 03:05:54.423]  So I'm up here.
[03:05:54.423 --> 03:05:56.663]  I'm Active Duty in Washington, and at my unit,
[03:05:57.952 --> 03:06:03.259]  They are pushing it so hard like a sales pitch and there are a lot of guys that don't want to take it but there are those that do.
[03:06:03.259 --> 03:06:10.349]  So I'm just curious as to what are they going to do when July rolls around and they say no.
[03:06:10.945 --> 03:06:11.766]  I don't want to take this.
[03:06:11.766 --> 03:06:14.288]  Are they going to face UCMJ action?
[03:06:14.288 --> 03:06:19.932]  Well, they've got to call their bluff, because we had Dr. Francis Boyle on, who we should get on for a whole hour just about refusing.
[03:06:19.932 --> 03:06:21.033]  He tried to make the hour about that.
[03:06:21.033 --> 03:06:22.193]  I should have let him do it.
[03:06:22.193 --> 03:06:32.501]  But he twice, when they did the illegal experimental anthrax shot that killed over 10,000 just in one round, I think 20,000 the next round, he got that suspended twice.
[03:06:32.501 --> 03:06:34.483]  And so that's why they're like, oh, it's voluntary.
[03:06:34.483 --> 03:06:36.204]  And then later, oh, it's mandatory.
[03:06:36.204 --> 03:06:37.445]  You've just got to say, listen,
[03:06:38.783 --> 03:06:40.866]  I know the officer class isn't taking it.
[03:06:40.866 --> 03:06:42.288]  It's experimental.
[03:06:42.288 --> 03:06:42.809]  I'm young.
[03:06:42.809 --> 03:06:43.450]  I'm not sick.
[03:06:43.450 --> 03:06:44.211]  I'm not taking it.
[03:06:44.211 --> 03:06:45.633]  I'm not being belligerent.
[03:06:45.633 --> 03:06:54.707]  And if you want to, you know, I'd rather be dishonorably discharged than have a permanent, you know, medical disorder because we're going to have to say no at some point.
[03:06:55.242 --> 03:06:56.844]  I mean, it's not like the tyranny's coming.
[03:06:56.844 --> 03:06:57.924]  It's here now, brother.
[03:06:57.924 --> 03:07:01.127]  It'll be Civil War starvation in two years if this keeps happening.
[03:07:01.127 --> 03:07:02.989]  This is the takedown of the West, brother.
[03:07:02.989 --> 03:07:04.530]  So we all just have to get ready for that.
[03:07:04.530 --> 03:07:06.292]  I told my wife, she agrees with me.
[03:07:06.292 --> 03:07:07.653]  My family agrees.
[03:07:07.653 --> 03:07:10.055]  I met with the former head of the Major Intelligence Agency.
[03:07:10.055 --> 03:07:10.916]  He agreed with me.
[03:07:10.916 --> 03:07:11.857]  There's no U.S.
[03:07:11.857 --> 03:07:13.018]  in two years, brother.
[03:07:13.018 --> 03:07:15.560]  I mean, I'm telling you, we went over the cliff.
[03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:17.622]  And I'm not being negative, I'm just being honest.
[03:07:17.622 --> 03:07:19.003]  It's all over now, folks.
[03:07:19.003 --> 03:07:19.584]  It's all over.
[03:07:20.084 --> 03:07:22.766]  And so we just have to admit we're under bio-attack.
[03:07:22.766 --> 03:07:24.688]  Of course it's being rolled out by the UN.
[03:07:24.688 --> 03:07:26.229]  This is how they take down America.
[03:07:26.229 --> 03:07:27.670]  They would never do this with a frontal assault.
[03:07:29.454 --> 03:07:29.794]  No, no.
[03:07:29.794 --> 03:07:38.019]  And simultaneously, our adversaries are doing masculinity camps and training while over here, it's, you know, it's woke warfare.
[03:07:38.019 --> 03:07:38.479]  Exactly.
[03:07:38.479 --> 03:07:45.123]  In China, they are about big total bravado, total machismo, savage male energy, which they had a problem with.
[03:07:45.123 --> 03:07:46.324]  They're now getting it again.
[03:07:46.324 --> 03:07:52.968]  The Russians are shooting live ammo into each other with body armor at point blank range and masculine test.
[03:07:52.968 --> 03:07:55.469]  And we're learning how to wear red high heel shoes.
[03:07:55.469 --> 03:07:56.830]  And clear coat nail polish.
[03:07:56.830 --> 03:07:58.051]  It's absolutely nuts.
[03:07:58.999 --> 03:08:00.622]  Yeah, I talked to a Green Beret.
[03:08:00.622 --> 03:08:09.336]  They were sent up to the West Coast just a month ago to put nail polish on each other.
[03:08:09.336 --> 03:08:11.118]  Makeup and studs and everything else.
[03:08:12.091 --> 03:08:14.952]  It's the whittling away of everything that makes this.
[03:08:14.952 --> 03:08:17.932]  Look, it's a psy-op to run you out of the military.
[03:08:17.932 --> 03:08:21.133]  So all it is, the officer closes the door, nobody does what they say.
[03:08:21.133 --> 03:08:22.693]  You don't take the shots.
[03:08:22.693 --> 03:08:23.714]  This is a criminal government.
[03:08:23.714 --> 03:08:25.354]  Just stop complying with the globalists.
[03:08:25.354 --> 03:08:28.495]  You are cells of patriots within what's left of the Republic.
[03:08:28.495 --> 03:08:30.095]  Don't follow any of this garbage.
[03:08:30.095 --> 03:08:32.135]  Does that make sense?
[03:08:32.135 --> 03:08:33.756]  Beautiful.
[03:08:33.756 --> 03:08:34.456]  Anything else, brother?
[03:08:36.019 --> 03:08:37.201]  Sure, have a good weekend, man.
[03:08:37.201 --> 03:08:38.562]  It's beer time over here.
[03:08:38.562 --> 03:08:39.163]  All right, brother.
[03:08:39.163 --> 03:08:40.945]  Thank you for holding to talk about that.
[03:08:40.945 --> 03:08:42.748]  All right, more calls straight ahead.
[03:08:42.748 --> 03:08:44.350]  Josh, Clarence, and Larry.
[03:08:44.350 --> 03:08:45.912]  And I'm hitting the other big news straight ahead.
[03:08:49.366 --> 03:08:50.887]  The people are awakening.
[03:08:50.887 --> 03:08:53.608]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[03:08:53.608 --> 03:08:55.689]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[03:08:55.689 --> 03:08:58.030]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[03:08:58.030 --> 03:09:07.394]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Comps especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[03:09:07.654 --> 03:09:16.256]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[03:09:16.256 --> 03:09:22.958]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[03:09:22.958 --> 03:09:24.398]  In their own words, they admit it.
[03:09:24.398 --> 03:09:28.819]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[03:09:29.299 --> 03:09:31.240]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[03:09:31.240 --> 03:09:32.320]  They're Faraday cages.
[03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:34.041]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[03:09:34.041 --> 03:09:36.022]  They work absolutely great.
[03:09:36.022 --> 03:09:45.206]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.

[03:11:04.108 --> 03:11:05.688]  Six bayonets, my friends.
[03:11:05.688 --> 03:11:10.850]  We are now 20 minutes into hour number four.
[03:11:10.850 --> 03:11:15.972]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[03:11:15.972 --> 03:11:19.873]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:11:22.113 --> 03:11:24.475]  It's not just evil in the universe, there's good.
[03:11:24.475 --> 03:11:31.700]  And all of you that are tuned in that care, that want to be good, no matter what color you are, you got a spirit God gave you, and you want justice.
[03:11:31.700 --> 03:11:33.701]  We're brothers and sisters together.
[03:11:33.701 --> 03:11:34.922]  And I knew all this was going to happen.
[03:11:34.922 --> 03:11:35.883]  I knew it was all going to come true.
[03:11:35.883 --> 03:11:39.185]  Because I've seen everything else the New World had done before.
[03:11:39.185 --> 03:11:39.925]  But now we're here.
[03:11:39.925 --> 03:11:42.627]  And now it's an amazing time to be alive.
[03:11:42.627 --> 03:11:49.132]  I'm going to get into the Russians and the Chinese and how this has escalated to a whole new level that's so massive.
[03:11:49.949 --> 03:11:54.932]  I don't even have words to describe it, but I want to get to three more callers, Josh, Clarence, and Larry in the time we have in this segment.
[03:11:54.932 --> 03:11:58.074]  Let me just say something.
[03:11:58.074 --> 03:12:05.258]  You heard that guy, obviously, in the military, and he was probably in Special Forces because the regular military is not being told to do this.
[03:12:05.258 --> 03:12:12.222]  And I didn't even want to say on air what I was told they were doing up in Idaho a month ago, but they're not just wearing red high heels.
[03:12:12.222 --> 03:12:19.106]  They order them in the sensitivity training to dress as women and put makeup on each other, and it's meant to run people out of the military.
[03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:22.001]  And you shouldn't even follow those orders.
[03:12:22.001 --> 03:12:23.163]  That's unconstitutional.
[03:12:23.163 --> 03:12:23.904]  It's garbage.
[03:12:23.904 --> 03:12:32.076]  But that's what the sick brass is doing while the Chinese literally run and pole vault into third-story buildings with their troops.
[03:12:32.076 --> 03:12:33.157]  And they're doing live fire.
[03:12:33.157 --> 03:12:34.519]  They're killing troops in training.
[03:12:34.519 --> 03:12:35.801]  I mean, it's what the Marines used to do.
[03:12:36.798 --> 03:12:38.039]  Before they got rid of it in the 80s.
[03:12:38.039 --> 03:12:39.920]  Marines used to kill somebody in every class.
[03:12:39.920 --> 03:12:40.881]  It was like what you did.
[03:12:40.881 --> 03:12:43.762]  You just kill somebody, dies in every class, maybe two or three.
[03:12:43.762 --> 03:12:45.163]  They kill people on purpose.
[03:12:45.163 --> 03:12:48.145]  Just to see what the, like somebody's a weirdo, full of crap.
[03:12:48.145 --> 03:12:55.850]  They'll decide we're gonna kill this guy on a training exercise to create the, and I'm not even saying that's good, but that's a real cult, okay?
[03:12:55.850 --> 03:12:58.931]  The Chinese are killing people on their training exercises on purpose.
[03:12:58.931 --> 03:13:00.833]  We're not doing that anymore.
[03:13:00.833 --> 03:13:05.535]  That's all Hessian, by the way, training that was brought over here during the Revolutionary War.
[03:13:07.196 --> 03:13:10.138]  That's what we've been turned into, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13:10.138 --> 03:13:12.559]  Because you've got to get used to somebody dying in training.
[03:13:12.559 --> 03:13:14.180]  You've got to get used to somebody.
[03:13:14.180 --> 03:13:17.661]  You just kind of shake them off that rope and drop them down and everybody keeps their mouth shut.
[03:13:17.661 --> 03:13:18.582]  Now, is that good?
[03:13:18.582 --> 03:13:19.262]  No.
[03:13:19.262 --> 03:13:23.324]  But now we're wearing red high heels and learning how to give blowjobs.
[03:13:23.324 --> 03:13:27.326]  And that's what the military has turned into, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13:27.326 --> 03:13:29.047]  And that's how they don't respect us.
[03:13:29.047 --> 03:13:31.568]  That's why the globalists have done this to us.
[03:13:31.568 --> 03:13:32.789]  I'm going to tell you again, the Russians
[03:13:34.961 --> 03:13:50.905]  One of their basic special forces classes is, at the lower level, just in the classes before you even make it is, you've got to do it dozens of times where at point-blank range with a low-caliber handgun, you draw your firearms about 10 feet apart and shoot each other in the chest.
[03:13:50.905 --> 03:13:53.666]  Just to get used to the danger of firearms, the danger of that.
[03:13:53.666 --> 03:13:54.246]  And the U.S.
[03:13:54.246 --> 03:13:56.487]  military used to do that, where they would make these people in sniper training,
[03:13:57.765 --> 03:14:02.088]  Sit there with a target at 500 yards, right by somebody's head, and take the shots.
[03:14:02.088 --> 03:14:03.289]  Well, everybody's wimps now.
[03:14:03.289 --> 03:14:04.090]  You don't do that.
[03:14:04.090 --> 03:14:06.591]  You say, well, that's extreme masculine, macho stuff.
[03:14:06.591 --> 03:14:11.115]  Okay, well, now you wear high heels.
[03:14:11.115 --> 03:14:13.697]  Now they put on dresses.
[03:14:13.697 --> 03:14:14.277]  And so you heard him.
[03:14:14.277 --> 03:14:18.160]  He's like, yeah, we're not just putting makeup on, we're putting nipple bobbers on.
[03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:21.522]  I mean, it's all to humiliate and demoralize us.
[03:14:21.522 --> 03:14:23.984]  And we have to, at a certain point, stop saying yes to all this crap.
[03:14:26.494 --> 03:14:29.456]  And yes, I didn't know what nipple bobbers were until I looked it up.
[03:14:29.456 --> 03:14:36.220]  They make the tribs put pincher things on their... Let's just... It's all... And you put up with it!
[03:14:36.220 --> 03:14:37.321]  We already kill our babies!
[03:14:37.321 --> 03:14:37.841]  Why not?
[03:14:37.841 --> 03:14:39.763]  I mean, we already kill babies after they're born.
[03:14:39.763 --> 03:14:40.243]  Why not?
[03:14:40.243 --> 03:14:43.025]  This is all the joke.
[03:14:43.025 --> 03:14:45.306]  Okay, Josh in Colorado.
[03:14:45.306 --> 03:14:45.927]  Thanks for holding.
[03:14:45.927 --> 03:14:48.128]  Go ahead, military friend on vaccine.
[03:14:48.128 --> 03:14:48.829]  And your take on it.
[03:14:48.829 --> 03:14:49.109]  Go ahead.
[03:14:50.240 --> 03:15:19.102]  Hey Alex, so I recently just got out of the military and I have some buddies still in and so we as like single soldiers in the military we have like dining facilities that we can eat at that were like meant for you know just so we can eat chow and stuff and the military started to implement to where if you are a if you're vaccinated then they're going to open a separate facility for you so you don't have to wear a mask and they're also doing this with gyms too
[03:15:20.612 --> 03:15:23.094]  Oh yeah, it's all social engineering.
[03:15:23.094 --> 03:15:27.818]  You're going to be first-class citizen if you've got your vaccine.
[03:15:27.818 --> 03:15:33.203]  And so we all, again, don't wear the mask, don't do any of it, but the military is a captured group they control.
[03:15:33.203 --> 03:15:34.444]  Continue.
[03:15:34.444 --> 03:15:36.466]  Oh yes, no, I totally agree.
[03:15:36.466 --> 03:15:46.515]  When I was in, you know, the military's gotten so soft, you know, and I hate to say this, but, you know, if we got into a war with, you know, China or Russia, we would get our ass kicked.
[03:15:46.515 --> 03:15:47.516]  Just from seeing what
[03:15:48.021 --> 03:15:52.503]  When I was in, it's gone so soft in the S.H.A.W.
[03:15:52.503 --> 03:15:54.724]  and it's sad seeing what's happened to our military.
[03:15:54.724 --> 03:16:03.289]  Well, the Chinese don't disregard human lives, but the Russians are absolutely trained to the opposite of what we've been trained in.
[03:16:03.289 --> 03:16:07.391]  I mean, it is like we have literally turned our military into just basically a gay orgy.
[03:16:08.655 --> 03:16:10.996]  You're in special forces and they're trying to make you wear a dress.
[03:16:32.196 --> 03:16:35.882]  Either don't do it and make an issue out of it, release a video, expose them, they'll back down.
[03:16:35.882 --> 03:16:42.131]  Or, wear the dress and then tell everybody, this is our dehumanization, this is how they've enslaved us at the meeting.
[03:16:42.131 --> 03:16:43.113]  And use it against them.
[03:16:43.113 --> 03:16:45.036]  This is going to backfire on these people, you understand?
[03:16:45.968 --> 03:16:46.228]  Right.
[03:16:46.228 --> 03:16:54.910]  No, and then also, too, when I was in, also, before I got out, they were saying that all the stuff that's being spread about the vaccines is misinformation to harm the U.S.
[03:16:54.910 --> 03:17:03.491]  economy and stuff, and that Bill Gates is really behind it and all of that, which I thought was pretty crazy because I was like, there's literally articles online contradicting what they say.
[03:17:03.491 --> 03:17:12.173]  So that's why I got out, because I was just tired of the whole SJW mode and the vaccines and the COVID bullcrap, so.
[03:17:12.173 --> 03:17:13.293]  Well, here's what I've experienced.
[03:17:14.321 --> 03:17:17.284]  Their attempts to sell this backfire.
[03:17:17.284 --> 03:17:18.745]  And so I'm not blaming you getting out.
[03:17:18.745 --> 03:17:22.989]  I would not join the military because of the vaccines, what they do to you, but I respect those that are there.
[03:17:22.989 --> 03:17:23.730]  So it's a catch-22.
[03:17:23.730 --> 03:17:25.732]  Do you get everybody that's good out?
[03:17:25.732 --> 03:17:28.234]  And then it's only bad people?
[03:17:28.234 --> 03:17:32.558]  Or do you stay in there and just be a mole?
[03:17:35.071 --> 03:17:40.412]  No, yeah, right, and the military is also being used as political pawns, like, for the Democratic Party.
[03:17:40.412 --> 03:17:44.193]  My mom said she was like, exactly what Hitler did during World War II.
[03:17:44.193 --> 03:17:48.154]  They would purge the military and then keep all the corrupt people in.
[03:17:48.154 --> 03:17:49.014]  Absolutely.
[03:17:49.014 --> 03:17:50.615]  They go, oh, the risk of misinformation.
[03:17:50.615 --> 03:17:55.376]  They admit it's untested, it's secret, it's got major health problems, it's being banned all over the world.
[03:17:55.376 --> 03:17:57.196]  And they gaslight and go, misinformation!
[03:17:57.196 --> 03:17:58.176]  Everything's fine!
[03:17:58.176 --> 03:17:58.917]  No, it's not!
[03:17:58.917 --> 03:18:01.917]  Alright, thank you, Josh.
[03:18:01.917 --> 03:18:04.018]  Alright, let's go to Clarence in Louisiana, then Larry.
[03:18:04.018 --> 03:18:04.578]  Go ahead, Clarence.
[03:18:05.954 --> 03:18:07.495]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[03:18:07.495 --> 03:18:12.636]  Um, we seem to be a lot of us facing where people don't listen and heed the warnings.
[03:18:12.636 --> 03:18:22.359]  I work in the maritime industry transporting, you know, river pilots that escort ships and not many, but a few, uh, keep asking.
[03:18:22.359 --> 03:18:24.860]  And I said, no, I'm not taking the vaccine.
[03:18:24.860 --> 03:18:34.783]  You know, Mr. Jones, I've been going over this, everything from the America's Frontline Doctors to Dr. Judy Mikovits and Mrs. Karen Walker, Mrs. Celeste Solem.
[03:18:35.504 --> 03:18:39.388]  And it seems like maybe they just blew off the conversation.
[03:18:39.388 --> 03:18:39.868]  I don't know.
[03:18:39.868 --> 03:18:44.032]  I mean, I agree with you.
[03:18:44.032 --> 03:18:48.315]  What do you think people are going to do as the death toll mounts?
[03:18:48.315 --> 03:18:49.116]  It's unfortunate.
[03:18:49.116 --> 03:18:51.558]  It seems like they've learned the hard way.
[03:18:51.558 --> 03:18:52.239]  They don't mean to harm.
[03:18:52.239 --> 03:18:54.721]  I don't think nobody would want their family or others to die.
[03:18:54.721 --> 03:18:59.345]  But once you really start seeing things for what they are, it's like any of us.
[03:18:59.345 --> 03:19:02.568]  Once I got into the Marine Corps, it was a totally different thing carrying a pack
[03:19:03.263 --> 03:19:08.267]  And hauling up mountains and playing war as a kid.
[03:19:08.267 --> 03:19:14.812]  The bedenicide, the silver bullet, the doctor, Dr. Bartlett there in Texas, he got that to help with swelling.
[03:19:14.812 --> 03:19:17.954]  The Benadryl, I would advise some aspirin.
[03:19:17.954 --> 03:19:21.697]  And Terracota, people worried about their tummy.
[03:19:21.697 --> 03:19:31.985]  I had a firefighter friend, because back when I was in EMS, and then later in behavioral health, you didn't get the flu shot, you didn't have a job.
[03:19:32.921 --> 03:19:39.544]  In the last four or five years, I myself may have suffered some effects of walking.
[03:19:39.544 --> 03:19:42.346]  So, by the grace of God, I think I'm doing well.
[03:19:42.346 --> 03:19:43.206]  I'm still ambulatory.
[03:19:43.206 --> 03:19:44.447]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:19:44.447 --> 03:19:45.507]  Thank you, Clarence, for holding.
[03:19:45.507 --> 03:19:46.128]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:46.128 --> 03:19:48.649]  Stay with us.
[03:19:48.649 --> 03:19:52.991]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic.
[03:19:53.769 --> 03:19:57.692]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[03:19:57.692 --> 03:20:01.054]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[03:20:01.054 --> 03:20:02.495]  And we're all in this together.
[03:20:02.495 --> 03:20:07.858]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:20:07.858 --> 03:20:08.539]  But it's true.
[03:20:08.539 --> 03:20:11.941]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:20:12.581 --> 03:20:12.861]  I think.
[03:20:27.415 --> 03:20:30.936]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[03:20:30.936 --> 03:20:34.718]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[03:20:56.795 --> 03:21:04.442]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[03:21:04.442 --> 03:21:10.208]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[03:21:10.208 --> 03:21:21.819]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[03:21:22.419 --> 03:21:24.560]  I need your help more than ever now.
[03:21:24.560 --> 03:21:28.662]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[03:21:28.662 --> 03:21:39.268]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:21:39.268 --> 03:21:48.813]  Whether it's high-quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[03:21:48.813 --> 03:21:49.473]  Thank you so much.
[03:21:50.093 --> 03:21:58.163]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[03:21:58.163 --> 03:21:59.224]  It is Down and Out.
[03:21:59.224 --> 03:22:01.046]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[03:22:01.046 --> 03:22:04.049]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[03:22:04.049 --> 03:22:04.710]  It's got four
[03:22:04.770 --> 03:22:05.030]  I think so.
[03:22:26.315 --> 03:22:27.995]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[03:22:27.995 --> 03:22:29.096]  It's very bittersweet.
[03:22:54.028 --> 03:22:57.029]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[03:22:57.029 --> 03:22:58.269]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[03:22:58.269 --> 03:22:59.210]  But I don't care about that.
[03:22:59.210 --> 03:23:01.230]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[03:23:01.230 --> 03:23:05.952]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[03:23:05.952 --> 03:23:09.313]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[03:23:09.313 --> 03:23:10.813]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[03:23:10.813 --> 03:23:12.014]  But let's just say this.
[03:23:12.014 --> 03:23:13.334]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[03:23:13.334 --> 03:23:15.795]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[03:23:16.415 --> 03:23:20.057]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:23:20.057 --> 03:23:22.638]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[03:23:22.638 --> 03:23:25.819]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[03:23:25.819 --> 03:23:26.679]  Do they fund freedom?
[03:23:26.679 --> 03:23:27.780]  No, a lot of them don't.
[03:23:27.780 --> 03:23:34.242]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[03:23:34.242 --> 03:23:35.963]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[03:23:35.963 --> 03:23:38.804]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[03:23:39.364 --> 03:23:42.486]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[03:23:42.486 --> 03:23:52.631]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[03:23:52.631 --> 03:23:55.292]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:24:06.630 --> 03:24:09.272]  It's 2.33 Central Standard Time while we're live.
[03:24:09.272 --> 03:24:11.653]  We'll be restreaming this show until 4 p.m.
[03:24:11.653 --> 03:24:16.696]  tomorrow when we got another original transmission I'm coming in to take tomorrow afternoon.
[03:24:16.696 --> 03:24:17.537]  From 2 to 4.
[03:24:17.537 --> 03:24:19.118]  From noon to 2.
[03:24:19.118 --> 03:24:21.919]  Then we're going to doll it up a little bit with documents and clips.
[03:24:21.919 --> 03:24:23.641]  I'm going to air it at 4 p.m.
[03:24:23.641 --> 03:24:26.342]  Central Standard Time tomorrow.
[03:24:26.342 --> 03:24:31.285]  The most banned demonized attack broadcast in the world.
[03:24:31.285 --> 03:24:32.286]  So let's hit this right now.
[03:24:33.404 --> 03:24:35.265]  If you're a TV viewer, you'll be able to see this.
[03:24:35.265 --> 03:24:37.307]  Radio listeners, we're going to post this to Infowars.com.
[03:24:37.307 --> 03:24:40.389]  There's also live streams right now, but this really tells all.
[03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:48.434]  Biden's going on to Air Force One, and he falls down not once, not twice, but three times.
[03:24:48.434 --> 03:24:54.958]  And then does this whole fake confidence thing with his shoulders, like he's a tough guy up at the top.
[03:24:54.958 --> 03:24:57.620]  And then salutes the troops.
[03:24:57.620 --> 03:25:00.622]  This is the guy that just threatened that he's going to, quote, attack Russia.
[03:25:01.303 --> 03:25:05.164]  That Russia's in deep trouble, that they're about to find out what he's going to do.
[03:25:05.164 --> 03:25:05.604]  No U.S.
[03:25:05.604 --> 03:25:08.265]  President ever talked like that.
[03:25:08.265 --> 03:25:16.648]  And that sounds like Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, his son.
[03:25:16.648 --> 03:25:26.871]  And then the Chinese, while he was falling down, it turns out, getting on Air Force One, were up in Alaska meeting with Tony Blinken, the little New World Order anti-American U.S.
[03:25:26.871 --> 03:25:27.491]  envoy to China.
[03:25:28.163 --> 03:25:30.965]  And they were just laughing at him with total disdain.
[03:25:30.965 --> 03:25:33.667]  Never seen the Chinese act like this to U.S.
[03:25:33.667 --> 03:25:34.607]  Presidents or U.S.
[03:25:34.607 --> 03:25:36.909]  Envoys.
[03:25:36.909 --> 03:25:37.990]  But there was a disdain.
[03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:39.210]  They know he wasn't elected.
[03:25:39.210 --> 03:25:40.371]  They know he's a fraud.
[03:25:40.371 --> 03:25:42.192]  They know they're a bunch of cowardly lawyers.
[03:25:42.192 --> 03:25:45.454]  And they know that almost all the Democrats are on their payroll.
[03:25:45.454 --> 03:25:49.437]  So they were talking to their subordinates.
[03:25:49.437 --> 03:25:51.498]  You know, Japan's the same way.
[03:25:51.498 --> 03:25:56.842]  We dropped atomic bombs on them and they worshipped us legitimately and thought we were God and wanted
[03:25:59.372 --> 03:26:00.633]  They start worshipping the U.S.
[03:26:00.633 --> 03:26:16.024]  President, Harry Truman, as their emperor, and then when he wouldn't do it, Douglas MacArthur was there, and they tried to treat him the same way, but he ended all of that.
[03:26:16.024 --> 03:26:17.846]  But the Japanese, it was all about might.
[03:26:17.846 --> 03:26:20.908]  If we beat their ass, we were God.
[03:26:20.908 --> 03:26:22.249]  That's how it is over in Asia.
[03:26:24.884 --> 03:26:27.426]  They don't care if we got a blue-haired woman with a mask on.
[03:26:27.426 --> 03:26:29.388]  They don't care if we got a pink-haired woman.
[03:26:29.388 --> 03:26:33.851]  They don't care if we got a, you know, trendy dude.
[03:26:33.851 --> 03:26:38.955]  The fact that they own them and they're on their payroll is they have disrespect for them.
[03:26:41.320 --> 03:26:47.362]  They've been busy beating up Americans and manipulating Americans, the left has, and now they're a big joke.
[03:26:47.362 --> 03:26:58.986]  Doesn't matter if they're senile, addled, brain-dead Biden goes and does a Stephanopoulos interview and shoots his mouth off about how he's God and all this or does another interview with Chuck Todd and says the same thing.
[03:26:58.986 --> 03:27:03.088]  In the real world, that's not what leaders act like.
[03:27:03.088 --> 03:27:10.190]  So Biden says all this and Putin goes, oh, I care about your health, meaning obviously you're falling apart.
[03:27:11.016 --> 03:27:12.997]  And I challenge you to do a debate.
[03:27:12.997 --> 03:27:20.338]  But if you talk about a killer, Putin's the one ending wars, you're the one starting wars.
[03:27:20.338 --> 03:27:23.779]  He said you ought to look in the mirror.
[03:27:23.779 --> 03:27:29.040]  So soulless Putin challenges killer Biden to live debate.
[03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:34.962]  So let's roll the video of Biden talking about how the Russians are about to find out about the pay.
[03:27:36.067 --> 03:27:37.708]  And a lot of other... He should have just said that.
[03:27:37.708 --> 03:27:39.989]  If he'd have said that, they might have taken respect.
[03:27:39.989 --> 03:27:41.170]  Then he kissed their ass after.
[03:27:41.170 --> 03:27:43.951]  I'm gonna destroy you.
[03:27:43.951 --> 03:27:44.972]  You're about to find out.
[03:27:44.972 --> 03:27:46.073]  But by the way, I really want to work with you.
[03:27:46.073 --> 03:27:48.214]  That's not how you do it.
[03:27:48.214 --> 03:27:52.896]  So Putin calls Biden's bluff, challenges him to televise live debate.
[03:27:52.896 --> 03:27:55.658]  And he said, oh, he's too busy playing Mario Kart.
[03:27:55.658 --> 03:27:56.318]  He can't do it.
[03:27:56.318 --> 03:27:57.179]  How shameful.
[03:27:57.179 --> 03:27:58.359]  He starts the fight.
[03:27:58.359 --> 03:27:59.280]  He runs his mouth.
[03:28:00.180 --> 03:28:05.486]  And now he can't even walk up a flight of stairs because he's too busy acting like he's Superman.
[03:28:05.486 --> 03:28:11.532]  So let's roll that video with the slowed down footage of Biden falling down.
[03:28:11.532 --> 03:28:13.434]  What price must he pay?
[03:28:13.434 --> 03:28:14.335]  He will pay a price.
[03:28:14.335 --> 03:28:16.117]  We had a long talk.
[03:28:16.117 --> 03:28:19.200]  I know him relatively well.
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:22.644]  And the conversation started off, I said, I know you and you know me.
[03:28:23.553 --> 03:28:26.134]  If I establish this occurred, then be prepared.
[03:28:26.134 --> 03:28:28.135]  You said you know he doesn't have a soul.
[03:28:28.135 --> 03:28:30.516]  I did say that to him, yes.
[03:28:30.516 --> 03:28:33.357]  And his response was, we understand one another.
[03:28:33.357 --> 03:28:34.418]  I wasn't being a wise guy.
[03:28:34.418 --> 03:28:36.298]  I was alone with him in his office.
[03:28:36.298 --> 03:28:37.319]  That's how it came about.
[03:28:37.319 --> 03:28:41.340]  It was when President Bush had said, I've looked in his eyes and saw a soul.
[03:28:41.340 --> 03:28:46.122]  The press always asks me, don't I wish I were debating him?
[03:28:46.122 --> 03:28:48.683]  No, I wish during high school I could take him behind the gym.
[03:28:48.683 --> 03:28:50.244]  That's what I wish.
[03:28:51.966 --> 03:28:54.928]  Why the hell would I take a test?
[03:28:54.928 --> 03:28:55.728]  Come on, man!
[03:28:55.728 --> 03:29:02.811]  That's like saying to you, before you got in this program, if you take a test whether you're taking cocaine or not, what do you think, huh?
[03:29:02.811 --> 03:29:04.732]  Are you a junkie?
[03:29:04.732 --> 03:29:17.479]  I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical, as well as my mental fitness, and to make a judgment about who I am.
[03:29:18.729 --> 03:29:27.232]  Now when President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in Arizona not long ago.
[03:29:27.232 --> 03:29:40.556]  So no amount of internet censorship at Google or Facebook or Twitter can clean up the fact that we have a 79 year old person with Alzheimer's and dementia as the President of the United States.
[03:29:42.210 --> 03:29:48.715]  And no amount of looking back at Trump and his mistakes will change that either, as they have the controlled right-wing opposition bashing Trump all day.
[03:29:48.715 --> 03:29:51.817]  I'll bash Trump, we deserve it, but I'm not against Trump.
[03:29:51.817 --> 03:29:52.978]  No, that's the puppet now.
[03:29:52.978 --> 03:29:54.139]  It's about him.
[03:29:54.139 --> 03:29:55.720]  It's about Joe Biden.
[03:29:55.720 --> 03:29:59.343]  You don't have Trump to kick around anymore, and I've got my issues with Trump.
[03:29:59.343 --> 03:30:03.486]  It's all about Joe Biden now.
[03:30:03.486 --> 03:30:11.913]  And so, let's go ahead and play the clip from Alaska yesterday with Tony Blinken, the envoy to China.
[03:30:12.984 --> 03:30:19.693]  And if you're a radio listener, you're going to miss out on this, but the Chinese, I've studied their body language, is usually very friendly, very fawning.
[03:30:19.693 --> 03:30:21.896]  This was extremely confrontational.
[03:30:21.896 --> 03:30:26.782]  And they were looking at Blinken like he was a sack of manure they owned, which he is.
[03:30:28.371 --> 03:30:34.536]  And so see now, oh, you're puppets of the Chinese and the globalists, and now you ran America to the ground, and now you're cutting our power off.
[03:30:34.536 --> 03:30:36.918]  You're not so powerful, are you, selling your country out?
[03:30:36.918 --> 03:30:39.780]  You could have been the president like Trump and run the superpower.
[03:30:39.780 --> 03:30:46.104]  But instead, oh, you're in the cult of sell America out, because all of you got where you are because you're puppets, and it's all you know.
[03:30:46.104 --> 03:30:50.188]  But now you're in power, and you're learning the system doesn't respect you at that level.
[03:30:50.188 --> 03:30:55.872]  Because you climbed all the way up to the top, and now you're just selling out your superpower status for no reason.
[03:30:57.054 --> 03:31:01.595]  Because of your leftist, little dick syndrome.
[03:31:01.595 --> 03:31:04.336]  America, you could mount its head on the wall.
[03:31:04.336 --> 03:31:10.757]  In fact, when Clinton first got inaugurated, Ron Silver, the Hollywood director, was in the news, was there, and he goes, they've got jets trying to attack us.
[03:31:10.757 --> 03:31:16.098]  That's how dumb and weird leftists are, and they're in free-order complex, and they go, it's okay, Ron, those are our jets now.
[03:31:16.098 --> 03:31:17.779]  And he goes, they're ours?
[03:31:17.779 --> 03:31:19.099]  They're ours!
[03:31:19.099 --> 03:31:21.100]  Let's use the military on the gun owners!
[03:31:21.100 --> 03:31:22.940]  Let's nuke them like Swalwell says!
[03:31:25.365 --> 03:31:27.586]  These people all are trust fund kids.
[03:31:27.586 --> 03:31:34.529]  But they all come out of weird, neurotic, inbred families that grew up for just generations in high-rises and are just like, ugh.
[03:31:34.529 --> 03:31:37.910]  And they look down on everyone and hate them.
[03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:41.112]  And they see you with a good-looking family, whether you're black, white, Hispanic.
[03:31:41.112 --> 03:31:42.012]  They see you with a business.
[03:31:42.012 --> 03:31:44.953]  They're like, how does the average person have a big, nice house and a pool?
[03:31:44.953 --> 03:31:45.934]  How are they on vacation?
[03:31:45.934 --> 03:31:46.894]  They say it all the time.
[03:31:46.894 --> 03:31:48.175]  How are they coming to protest us?
[03:31:48.175 --> 03:31:49.255]  Why do they have money?
[03:31:49.255 --> 03:31:50.316]  Make them poor!
[03:31:50.316 --> 03:31:52.897]  Debo's group has said that years ago.
[03:31:54.355 --> 03:31:59.418]  We're going to make people poor so we can control them.
[03:31:59.418 --> 03:32:01.459]  Oh, as if that makes you richer.
[03:32:01.459 --> 03:32:05.921]  See, they're so poor that they want to make you like they are.
[03:32:05.921 --> 03:32:10.204]  They want to lower you so they can be above you.
[03:32:10.204 --> 03:32:11.264]  That's not the American system.
[03:32:11.264 --> 03:32:13.446]  That's not the American dream.
[03:32:13.446 --> 03:32:17.988]  And so now we'll go to break.
[03:32:17.988 --> 03:32:19.369]  We'll play the Chinese when we come back.
[03:32:19.369 --> 03:32:22.911]  But I mean, they're just looking at him like, dude, you work.
[03:32:23.553 --> 03:32:30.057]  For a guy whose son we have on tape screwing 10-year-old Chinese girls and snorting cocaine.
[03:32:30.057 --> 03:32:31.678]  And we have Biden doing the same thing.
[03:32:31.678 --> 03:32:32.159]  It's over.
[03:32:32.159 --> 03:32:32.959]  We own you.
[03:32:32.959 --> 03:32:34.300]  What are you doing here?
[03:32:34.300 --> 03:32:36.361]  That's why Biden has told CNN, G.G.
[03:32:36.361 --> 03:32:37.722]  Pink can take Hong Kong.
[03:32:37.722 --> 03:32:38.082]  G.G.
[03:32:38.082 --> 03:32:40.564]  Pink can run death camps.
[03:32:40.564 --> 03:32:42.966]  Because he knows!
[03:32:42.966 --> 03:32:49.570]  But his weird little leftist Tony Blinken wants to sit up there and be all
[03:32:50.367 --> 03:32:51.508]  We're in charge here.
[03:32:51.508 --> 03:32:54.469]  And the Chinese are like, you're not in charge of crap!
[03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:55.930]  We're not going to sit here and play along.
[03:32:55.930 --> 03:32:57.030]  We own your debt.
[03:32:57.030 --> 03:32:58.291]  We own Hollywood.
[03:32:58.291 --> 03:32:59.671]  We stole the election.
[03:32:59.671 --> 03:33:00.552]  We put you in.
[03:33:00.552 --> 03:33:05.914]  And when we tell you jump, we say how high, you say, yes sir, boss.
[03:33:05.914 --> 03:33:07.155]  Is that clear, Blinken?
[03:33:08.038 --> 03:33:18.644]  Because see, Blinken, you've had Americans to kick around and the Green Berets to put on red high heels and learn how to give blowjobs, and you've got your pedophile drag queen story time going, and you do all that.
[03:33:18.644 --> 03:33:21.586]  But see, the Russians and the Chinese aren't like you.
[03:33:21.586 --> 03:33:23.727]  They just want to dominate your ass.
[03:33:23.727 --> 03:33:25.868]  And so now it'll happen to you.
[03:33:25.868 --> 03:33:28.350]  And you'll be removed, and all of you will be removed in the end.
[03:33:29.011 --> 03:33:30.173]  You're all gonna lose.
[03:33:30.173 --> 03:33:31.535]  Hollywood's over.
[03:33:31.535 --> 03:33:33.357]  Big-time TV's over.
[03:33:33.357 --> 03:33:35.380]  Mainstream leftism is over.
[03:33:35.380 --> 03:33:36.402]  It's a joke.
[03:33:36.402 --> 03:33:37.483]  It's a failure.
[03:33:37.483 --> 03:33:39.446]  It's a fraud.
[03:33:39.446 --> 03:33:45.255]  And their attempt to steal this election and finish off America will finish them off and the Chi-coms you watch.
[03:33:48.374 --> 03:34:02.020]  The ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at InfoWarsStore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com for the lowest price possible to complete your daily mouth cleaning routine.

[03:34:47.944 --> 03:34:51.807]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[03:34:51.807 --> 03:34:56.109]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[03:34:56.109 --> 03:35:04.235]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:04.975 --> 03:35:21.589]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[03:35:21.589 --> 03:35:32.618]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[03:35:33.118 --> 03:35:41.600]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:49.042]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:35:49.042 --> 03:35:52.223]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing Devil's Advocate on air.
[03:35:53.513 --> 03:35:56.376]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists.
[03:35:56.376 --> 03:36:05.403]  That the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[03:36:05.403 --> 03:36:07.165]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[03:36:07.165 --> 03:36:07.965]  They play God.
[03:36:07.965 --> 03:36:12.810]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[03:36:12.810 --> 03:36:17.073]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me, they've tried to get me to join them.
[03:36:17.073 --> 03:36:18.935]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level,
[03:36:20.351 --> 03:36:21.291]  I have the Holy Spirit.
[03:36:21.291 --> 03:36:23.072]  I have a connection with God.
[03:36:23.072 --> 03:36:26.534]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[03:36:26.534 --> 03:36:35.337]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power over it.
[03:36:35.337 --> 03:36:40.159]  Whether you're just a steel worker, or a school teacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[03:36:41.244 --> 03:36:44.966]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[03:36:44.966 --> 03:36:49.088]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[03:36:49.088 --> 03:36:50.328]  With or without a battery.
[03:37:06.275 --> 03:37:12.381]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[03:37:12.381 --> 03:37:13.222]  Excellent.

[03:37:18.828 --> 03:37:21.851]  And you can too, at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:37:23.412 --> 03:37:34.183]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[03:37:34.183 --> 03:37:39.127]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[03:37:39.127 --> 03:37:45.013]  Support the InfoWar and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today.
[03:37:45.013 --> 03:37:46.114]  InfoWarStore.com
[03:37:52.171 --> 03:38:03.982]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:38:03.982 --> 03:38:07.084]  Our once free societies are being dismantled.
[03:38:07.084 --> 03:38:12.789]  Whether in New Zealand, Australia, Europe, the UK, United States, doesn't matter.
[03:38:12.789 --> 03:38:15.712]  It's the same corporations directing the same systems.
[03:38:15.712 --> 03:38:17.854]  And it's meant to be outrageous, it's meant to be asinine.
[03:38:18.627 --> 03:38:19.888]  It's meant to not make sense.
[03:38:19.888 --> 03:38:20.848]  Look at this article.
[03:38:20.848 --> 03:38:23.110]  Just went live on InfoWars.com.
[03:38:23.110 --> 03:38:31.475]  UK police wake 82-year-old woman in the night after someone tattled she had tea with neighbors.
[03:38:31.475 --> 03:38:38.019]  But their borders are wide open and they don't test illegal aliens coming into England or the US for COVID.
[03:38:38.019 --> 03:38:38.960]  And that's official news.
[03:38:38.960 --> 03:38:40.320]  It's all crap.
[03:38:40.320 --> 03:38:41.721]  It's all a lie.
[03:38:41.721 --> 03:38:44.123]  Stop complying with the fraud.
[03:38:44.123 --> 03:38:47.465]  The UK police are globalist police punishing the UK for Brexit.
[03:38:49.890 --> 03:38:51.752]  They admit they're doing this.
[03:38:51.752 --> 03:38:54.514]  And if you just chain-reaction the info, it's over for them.
[03:38:54.514 --> 03:39:01.120]  And understand, the globalists invested in China, opened it up in the 70s to de-industrialize us.
[03:39:01.120 --> 03:39:02.742]  China was supposed to not be military, though.
[03:39:02.742 --> 03:39:04.223]  It would be under globalist control.
[03:39:04.223 --> 03:39:05.925]  Of course they double-crossed.
[03:39:05.925 --> 03:39:08.147]  That's all these groups do to each other.
[03:39:08.147 --> 03:39:09.208]  True separation of powers.
[03:39:10.129 --> 03:39:17.734]  And so now the Chi-Coms don't respect Biden or the people they helped steal the election for, and are like, what are you doing criticizing us for Uyghur slave camps and stuff?
[03:39:17.734 --> 03:39:22.437]  You've enslaved the black people, which statistically isn't even true!
[03:39:22.437 --> 03:39:28.321]  Less than 20 black people that are innocent a year get shot by police, and I'm not defending that!
[03:39:28.321 --> 03:39:30.563]  You know how many millions of black babies get aborted?
[03:39:30.563 --> 03:39:31.844]  I care about all the babies.
[03:39:31.844 --> 03:39:34.726]  You know how many millions of people that are innocent get sent to prison?
[03:39:34.726 --> 03:39:36.427]  You know how many millions of innocent people
[03:39:38.883 --> 03:39:40.284]  Die of medical malpractice?
[03:39:40.284 --> 03:39:43.004]  You know how many black people are dying from these shots?
[03:39:43.004 --> 03:39:46.326]  I just don't want to hear it!
[03:39:46.326 --> 03:39:54.308]  But I go downtown and I see all these trendy black people and white people and the rest of them together just buying into all the crap and what you are is idiots.
[03:39:54.308 --> 03:40:01.751]  You're under globalist mind control and you're chumps, you're marks, you're suckers, you're schmucks.
[03:40:01.751 --> 03:40:06.353]  And I care about you because if I don't value your life, my life doesn't have value.
[03:40:06.353 --> 03:40:06.853]  You got that?
[03:40:08.405 --> 03:40:14.109]  If I look down on you and hate you just for what color you are or whatever, I lose value in God's eyes.
[03:40:14.109 --> 03:40:19.733]  I see value in you, but let me tell you, you better see value in me!
[03:40:19.733 --> 03:40:21.834]  And you better know how much danger you're in.
[03:40:21.834 --> 03:40:27.438]  Because if you've got any connection to God, that means it's God's creation in the universe.
[03:40:27.438 --> 03:40:30.780]  You know you're getting tingles up your spine, because we're all in a lot of danger.
[03:40:30.780 --> 03:40:33.922]  And that's why I'm here.
[03:40:33.922 --> 03:40:34.763]  That's why we're all here.
[03:40:34.763 --> 03:40:37.485]  And I'm here to tell you, danger, danger, Will Robbins.
[03:40:38.855 --> 03:40:49.987]  I don't care what damn color you are or where you even came from, but if you don't understand you're under globalist attack, and if you don't understand this is an anti-human movement, then you're dumb, and you're turned over to the devil.
[03:40:49.987 --> 03:40:51.269]  Here's that clip I was talking about.
[03:40:51.269 --> 03:40:52.870]  I watched like 30 minutes of it last night.
[03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:54.692]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:40:54.692 --> 03:40:58.216]  This is in Alaska yesterday afternoon, and this is the U.S.
[03:40:58.216 --> 03:40:59.658]  envoy to China, Tony Blinken.
[03:41:00.387 --> 03:41:14.316]  And he tries to, like, half-heartedly bring up some stuff, which is actually good they did, and the Chinese just bitch-slap them down, and use the whole Black Lives Matter thing against them, which they're funding through Hollywood, and basically saying, we'll just have the blacks burn down your country, shut up.
[03:41:14.316 --> 03:41:15.617]  Here it is.
[03:41:15.617 --> 03:41:27.425]  We'll also discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies.
[03:41:29.142 --> 03:41:35.985]  Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability.
[03:41:35.985 --> 03:41:42.928]  Well, you can't blame this problem on somebody else.
[03:41:42.928 --> 03:41:48.370]  I have to tell you, what I'm hearing is very different from what you described.
[03:41:48.370 --> 03:41:55.133]  I'm hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we're re-engaged with our allies and partners.
[03:41:56.081 --> 03:42:08.029]  I'm also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking.
[03:42:08.029 --> 03:42:11.992]  Well, I think we thought too well of the United States.
[03:42:11.992 --> 03:42:13.013]  We thought that the U.S.
[03:42:13.013 --> 03:42:16.715]  side will follow the necessary diplomatic protocols.
[03:42:20.982 --> 03:42:24.863]  So for China, it was necessary that we make our position clear.
[03:42:24.863 --> 03:42:33.305]  So let me say here that in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.
[03:42:50.945 --> 03:42:54.907]  Well, I think we thought too well of the United States.
[03:42:54.907 --> 03:42:55.947]  We thought that the U.S.
[03:42:55.947 --> 03:42:58.148]  side will follow the necessary...
[03:43:12.990 --> 03:43:17.191]  Then the Chinese get up and leave, and then Blinken calls the media back over to act tough.
[03:43:17.191 --> 03:43:21.553]  I mean, if you know about diplomacy and how these true groups act, this is unprecedented.
[03:43:21.553 --> 03:43:22.673]  They never acted like that with Trump.
[03:43:22.673 --> 03:43:26.755]  They're always, oh, you're our friend, eat chocolate cake, because they knew Trump was strong.
[03:43:26.755 --> 03:43:32.437]  They are literally just absolutely in Biden's face.
[03:43:32.437 --> 03:43:33.077]  It's disgusting.
[03:43:34.267 --> 03:43:38.708]  Owen Schroyer in the studio right through those doors does a great job every day at 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:43:38.708 --> 03:43:40.329]  hosting The War Room.
[03:43:40.329 --> 03:43:51.991]  And believe me, Big Tech works around the clock with the Chi-Coms and others to make sure no one watches the Alex Jones Show or American Journal Weekday Mornings with Harrison Smith and Tom Papert and others, or The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:43:51.991 --> 03:43:54.592]  That's why you promoting it is everything.
[03:43:54.592 --> 03:43:56.352]  It's like the oxygen in the room.
[03:43:56.352 --> 03:43:58.713]  You don't promote us, we all lose, including you.
[03:43:59.741 --> 03:44:01.962]  So Owen's going to pop in and tell us what's coming up here in just a moment.
[03:44:01.962 --> 03:44:09.703]  I want to get him on every day at the end of the show to tell us what's coming up in just a few minutes on the streams and satellites that his great program is carrying.
[03:44:09.703 --> 03:44:16.105]  But separately, we had to end store-wide free shipping, as you know, because the storable food people and others are saying, hey, we're not making any money.
[03:44:16.105 --> 03:44:16.645]  We've got to make money.
[03:44:16.645 --> 03:44:18.505]  We're not communists.
[03:44:18.505 --> 03:44:22.886]  Storable food, the biggest part of the cost, one of the biggest costs, is the shipping.
[03:44:24.082 --> 03:44:30.992]  But we do have store-wide free shipping and 50% off on select items in the Mega Blowout Sale!
[03:44:32.645 --> 03:44:33.686]  Thank you for having me.
[03:44:56.073 --> 03:45:04.537]  Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, Activated Charcoal Mouthwash, Dr. Jones Extra Strength Cobb & Chill, Regular Strength Cobb & Chill, and Emrix Essentials.
[03:45:04.537 --> 03:45:11.381]  All of those, the Natural Deodorant, Organic Deodorant, the Body Wash, the Shampoo, 15 Essential Oils.
[03:45:11.381 --> 03:45:14.082]  You can buy them individually or altogether discounted.

[03:45:21.620 --> 03:45:22.501]  People love it.
[03:45:22.501 --> 03:45:26.202]  InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:26.202 --> 03:45:29.264]  And I can only thank you all for your support.
[03:45:29.264 --> 03:45:36.627]  Please take advantage of the Mega Blowout sale, 50% off and free shipping on those items that I just mentioned at InfowarStore.com.
[03:45:36.627 --> 03:45:38.048]  And we're not supposed to exist anymore.
[03:45:38.048 --> 03:45:42.410]  The tires were supposed to have all the power, but because of you, literally, we're still on air.
[03:45:42.410 --> 03:45:45.351]  And don't forget, I'll be back tomorrow, 4 p.m.
[03:45:45.351 --> 03:45:47.852]  Central, for a two-hour transmission.
[03:45:48.686 --> 03:45:53.830]  It takes less crew to do it taped, so we're going to let some of the crew off, but I'm going to come in at noon, or before noon.
[03:45:53.830 --> 03:46:01.375]  I'm going to tape for two hours, have two hours to doll up the interview and add articles and videos, plus even better than a live show, and then 4 p.m.
[03:46:01.375 --> 03:46:06.939]  Central, we're going to air a big special report on a bunch of breaking news and developments and a lot of key intel.
[03:46:06.939 --> 03:46:08.901]  I want to have commercial free to get into Crimson.
[03:46:09.685 --> 03:46:15.188]  Contagion and the gene therapy and how they're implanting cancer in us and just the total proof that's coming out.
[03:46:15.188 --> 03:46:16.208]  That's 4 p.m.
[03:46:16.208 --> 03:46:17.469]  Central, 5 p.m.
[03:46:17.469 --> 03:46:18.689]  Eastern, 3 p.m.
[03:46:18.689 --> 03:46:19.570]  Mountain, 2 p.m.
[03:46:19.570 --> 03:46:20.030]  Pacific.
[03:46:20.030 --> 03:46:29.954]  Tomorrow, Infowars.com, Newswars.com and of course all the other great radio affiliates, TV affiliates, pick us up and please support those local affiliates and spread the word about them.
[03:46:29.954 --> 03:46:30.655]  They are precious.
[03:46:30.655 --> 03:46:32.055]  Start tithing to those stations.
[03:46:32.055 --> 03:46:32.876]  They're better than your church.
[03:46:32.876 --> 03:46:33.716]  They're not fighting abortion.
[03:46:34.276 --> 03:46:37.679]  Owen Schroyer, you're going live here in about four or five minutes.
[03:46:37.679 --> 03:46:39.480]  There's two minutes left in our transmission.
[03:46:39.480 --> 03:46:42.803]  Tell us what's coming up on the War Room today.
[03:46:42.803 --> 03:46:48.867]  Well, it's really incredible the embarrassment that the Biden administration has been on the world stage this week, Alex.
[03:46:48.867 --> 03:46:51.729]  We had Biden's saber-rattling with Putin.
[03:46:51.729 --> 03:46:54.091]  The guy, Biden, couldn't even pick up a saber.
[03:46:54.091 --> 03:46:57.113]  Well, beyond saber-rattling, we're going to get you, you're evil, look out.
[03:46:57.113 --> 03:46:59.135]  I mean, this is trying to start a war stuff.
[03:47:00.208 --> 03:47:04.191]  Well, and Biden doesn't even know what's going on, so he may be starting a war, he may not.
[03:47:04.191 --> 03:47:05.893]  I mean, that's the danger of the situation.
[03:47:05.893 --> 03:47:12.699]  Then the Chinese delegation showing up in Anchorage, Alaska yesterday and just slapping the Biden administration in the face.
[03:47:12.699 --> 03:47:14.901]  Secretary Blinken is just blinking.
[03:47:14.901 --> 03:47:15.861]  He was caught off guard.
[03:47:15.861 --> 03:47:17.503]  That was a total embarrassment.
[03:47:17.503 --> 03:47:20.826]  And then today, Biden can't even get up a flight of stairs.
[03:47:21.446 --> 03:47:25.931]  So really quite an embarrassing week on the world stage for Joe Biden in the United States of America.
[03:47:25.931 --> 03:47:27.773]  But this is what the Democrats love, Alex.
[03:47:27.773 --> 03:47:29.875]  This is what the liberal progressive left loves.
[03:47:29.875 --> 03:47:31.676]  They love seeing America weakened.
[03:47:31.676 --> 03:47:36.802]  They love seeing us be removed down the pegs in the power structure of the world.
[03:47:36.802 --> 03:47:38.824]  That's what Haas said a few months ago.
[03:47:38.824 --> 03:47:40.766]  Haas said we're going to end America with Biden.
[03:47:40.766 --> 03:47:41.466]  He said it!
[03:47:41.466 --> 03:47:42.067]  And they're doing it!
[03:47:43.675 --> 03:47:52.017]  So we're not really surprised by this, but I think that it's time for the United States of America to take a serious look in the mirror and say, you know what?
[03:47:52.017 --> 03:47:54.217]  We messed up big time.
[03:47:54.217 --> 03:47:56.818]  And we're seeing the recall petitions for Newsom.
[03:47:56.818 --> 03:48:00.159]  We're seeing petitions to get Cuomo out.
[03:48:00.159 --> 03:48:01.719]  We need to have a national petition.
[03:48:01.719 --> 03:48:06.680]  In fact, next week may be the time to start the drive, considering how bad this week has been for Biden.
[03:48:07.270 --> 03:48:08.911]  Next week may be the time to start the drive.
[03:48:08.911 --> 03:48:09.931]  We should start a petition.
[03:48:09.931 --> 03:48:11.872]  Yeah, we should start the states to have a CONCOM.
[03:48:11.872 --> 03:48:12.813]  We're already in an emergency.
[03:48:12.813 --> 03:48:14.154]  I know CONCOMs are dangerous.
[03:48:14.154 --> 03:48:14.994]  To withdraw him.
[03:48:14.994 --> 03:48:15.975]  He's a fraud.
[03:48:15.975 --> 03:48:19.436]  Owen, so much more coming up in two minutes when you start the War Room.
[03:48:19.436 --> 03:48:24.339]  Streams are at BandopVideoInfoWars.com and stations everywhere picking it up.
[03:48:24.339 --> 03:48:25.039]  So much more.
[03:48:25.039 --> 03:48:25.960]  The War Room.
[03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:27.901]  And you've got some guests on too, right?
[03:48:27.901 --> 03:48:31.783]  Yeah, we do have a guest from Rebel News, Andrew Says.
[03:48:31.783 --> 03:48:33.704]  Alright, Owen Shore, the War Room, coming up.
[03:48:33.704 --> 03:48:36.245]  I'll see you back tomorrow, 4 p.m., for the Saturday Special.
