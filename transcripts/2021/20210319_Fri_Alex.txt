[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.490]  Must watch Friday live.
[00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.912]  The Mark of the Beast is here.
[00:00:03.012 --> 00:00:09.398]  Walmart joins Communist China-EU with medical social credit score.
[00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:13.808]  And here it is out of the New York Times, Walmart becomes largest U.S.
[00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:18.310]  vaccine provider to join push for digital vaccine credentials.
[00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.691]  They say you may even need it in the future to go in their store.
[00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:23.932]  Oh, remember, they had the U.N.
[00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:24.672]  call for it all.
[00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:25.913]  People go, oh, that'll never happen.
[00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:28.714]  I said, you watch, I'll just keep calling for it till you get used to it.
[00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:32.995]  Now in the U.K., they promised they wouldn't do it.
[00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:34.136]  It was a conspiracy theory.
[00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:35.696]  The internal documents came out.
[00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:37.617]  They were planning a year ago to roll this out.
[00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:40.472]  That was in Operation Lockstep ten years ago.
[00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:43.153]  Crimson Contagion two years ago.
[00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:47.334]  It's all planned out and everything they plan out they pull until we say no.
[00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:49.994]  So they're just hitting us with everything they've got right now.
[00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:59.436]  No government will authorize mRNA gene therapy because in the human studies it caused so much cancer and death and boy-in-the-bubble syndrome.
[00:00:59.456 --> 00:00:59.857]  Look it up.
[00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:01.597]  Showed you Mainline News yesterday.
[00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:15.838]  And so now they're just bum rushing us on every single front and they're admitting that the vaccines are actually causing new virus strains that are actually deadlier than what was happening before.
[00:01:16.278 --> 00:01:21.220]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:30.205]  We'll also discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang,
[00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:36.993]  Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies.
[00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:43.741]  Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability.
[00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:51.449]  That's why they're not merely internal matters and why we feel an obligation to raise these issues here today.
[00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:54.740]  China is firmly opposed to U.S.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.341]  interference in China's internal affairs.
[00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:06.747]  We have expressed our staunch opposition to such interference and we will take firm actions in response.
[00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:12.271]  On human rights, we hope that the United States will do better on human rights.
[00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:17.915]  China has made steady progress in human rights and the fact is that
[00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:25.300]  There are many problems within the United States regarding human rights, which is admitted by the U.S.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.441]  itself as well.
[00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:36.327]  The United States has also said that countries can't rely on force in today's world to resolve the challenges we face.
[00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:45.554]  And it is a failure to use various means to topple the so-called authoritarian states.
[00:02:46.804 --> 00:02:48.345]  It's impossible to fight back.
[00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.812]  Well, you can't blame this problem on somebody else.
[00:03:21.252 --> 00:03:25.514]  I have to tell you, what I'm hearing is very different from what you described.
[00:03:26.714 --> 00:03:33.497]  I'm hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we're re-engaged with our allies and partners.
[00:03:34.437 --> 00:03:39.199]  I'm also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking.
[00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:40.360]  We think highly of you.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.301]  We think you will abide by the basic diplomatic etiquette.
[00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:50.210]  Well, I think we thought too well of the United States.
[00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.290]  We thought that the U.S.
[00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.092]  side will follow the necessary diplomatic protocols.
[00:03:55.572 --> 00:03:58.573]  So for China, it was necessary that we make our position clear.
[00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:22.188]  So let me say here that in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.
[00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:26.710]  The United States is now a joke by design.
[00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:34.073]  And you've got all the little woke mobs that work for the most destructive globalist corporations in the world.
[00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:37.595]  Even though they're on the payroll, they work for their own destruction.
[00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:41.761]  There's an excellent headline on Band.Video.
[00:04:42.662 --> 00:04:46.265]  David Icke has a channel on there and he uploaded it and it says it all.
[00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:52.410]  That the woke mob works for tyranny and they work against themselves.
[00:04:53.391 --> 00:05:02.619]  But you can't explain that to them because they're losers who don't have any basic street smarts and have no idea what they're even facing.
[00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:03.360]  There it is.
[00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:07.223]  Woke is a tyranny destroying freedom.
[00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.174]  On the way to destroying itself, David Icke dot connector.
[00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:17.658]  Excellent report at band dot video.
[00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:18.539]  And it says it all.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:26.368]  They have no idea what they're even doing, how the world even works.
[00:05:26.608 --> 00:05:29.251]  And it's, it's just, it's, it's, it's mind blowing.
[00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:43.508]  I thought when they rolled out their first bioweapon, it would be more of a simulant and would not be that deadly, just a practice getting us all locked down ahead of much stronger attacks, which they've said, indeed, that's what they're doing.
[00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:45.470]  Gates and others admit this was all just a drill.
[00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:49.353]  But the vaccine itself is the next bio attack.
[00:05:49.493 --> 00:05:50.574]  It is the terror attack.
[00:05:51.174 --> 00:05:54.697]  And I'm really surprised at how deadly it is.
[00:05:56.064 --> 00:06:02.188]  I thought it would be more of a soft kill, which obviously it is, but it's so strong that it's killed a lot of people right up front.
[00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:09.493]  We opened the phones up yesterday, didn't screen your calls, and we had a credible caller talk about their mamas and their daddies dying when they took it.
[00:06:09.513 --> 00:06:13.235]  And I can open the newspaper up and see all the death everywhere.
[00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:16.437]  But if you criticize it, you get manned off social media.
[00:06:16.457 --> 00:06:25.003]  Think of the crimes against humanity big tech is carrying out now against we the people trying to silence us so that they can target
[00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:27.643]  The gullible out there for death.
[00:06:28.464 --> 00:06:30.246]  We are witnessing a true holocaust.
[00:06:31.227 --> 00:06:36.094]  Welcome, my friends, to this live March 19th, Friday, worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:40.919]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I'm very honored to be here with you.
[00:06:44.582 --> 00:06:49.246]  We're going to have open phones in the second, third, and fourth hour today that I will be hosting.
[00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:55.871]  We will open the phones up for people that love vaccines, people that hate vaccines, people to call in with your
[00:06:56.704 --> 00:07:00.386]  Positive stories or negative stories or in-between stories.
[00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:03.928]  Of course, no one will call in with a positive story because they don't exist.
[00:07:04.568 --> 00:07:05.909]  At least not yet that we found them.
[00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:14.354]  But uncensored, we will open the phones up so that all the folks that have lost family members or people that have been paralyzed or people that have had convulsions or people that have...
[00:07:15.094 --> 00:07:20.958]  Gotten them other neurological disorders or people that have had blood start pouring out of their eyeballs and ears.
[00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:24.401]  Well, we love to hear from the survivors out there.
[00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:29.004]  So that's in the second third and fourth hour today.
[00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:32.907]  They don't want you to have a voice big tech is mercilessly.
[00:07:34.318 --> 00:07:35.278]  Shutting everyone down.
[00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:39.420]  I was on Andrew Schultz, one of the biggest comics in the world now.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.501]  He's been around for 10 years, but he's definitely going to end up eclipsing Dave Chappelle.
[00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:46.682]  I mean, he gets more views on YouTube than Dave Chappelle does.
[00:07:46.722 --> 00:07:49.103]  His comedy special is more popular on Netflix.
[00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:51.123]  He's a really funny guy, especially on his feet.
[00:07:51.183 --> 00:07:52.364]  I've been a fan for a long time.
[00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:59.106]  And I had a chance to go on a show in Miami and one of the co-hosts had taken the mRNA vaccine.
[00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:02.967]  And I said, you know, it's a gene therapy and that's associated with cancer.
[00:08:03.905 --> 00:08:12.688]  Well, sure enough, they took the episode down after it got 2.2 million views, and I talked to Schultz this morning and said, yeah, your guess was correct.
[00:08:13.408 --> 00:08:15.849]  It's because of medical misinformation.
[00:08:16.369 --> 00:08:22.451]  Well, I have a whole stack of mainstream news, including the Associated Press, saying that they never could approve mRNA vaccines.
[00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:26.412]  There were calls by international organizations of scientists to ban it.
[00:08:27.847 --> 00:08:29.788]  Because it's gene editing, basically.
[00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:31.488]  It's a gene therapy.
[00:08:31.648 --> 00:08:33.629]  It can give rise to cancer.
[00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.810]  It's directly associated with cancer.
[00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:44.433]  And most cancer is a RNA or mRNA or messenger RNA or guide RNA trigger.
[00:08:44.894 --> 00:08:49.355]  And I've shown you all the top prestigious scientific firms, you name it, the last few days here on air.
[00:08:50.576 --> 00:08:51.376]  But think about that.
[00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:53.297]  Banned from a comedy show
[00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:57.233]  Because they say it's medical misinformation.
[00:08:57.533 --> 00:08:58.894]  And where do they get that?
[00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:00.215]  Well, the UN.
[00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.597]  And why do I raise that today?
[00:09:04.057 --> 00:09:05.458]  Chris Sky is a Canadian.
[00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:06.799]  He's an activist.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.383]  He's a long-term listener of this show for almost 20 years, since he was like 13, 14 years old.
[00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:17.026]  And they're still on lockdown where he's at in Canada.
[00:09:18.562 --> 00:09:23.425]  And when, so when he went to the store, he'd wear a mask and they came to his house at night and tried to arrest him.
[00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:24.906]  But he knew the law.
[00:09:24.966 --> 00:09:29.708]  He knew that these are the code enforcer police that don't even really have arrest power.
[00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:41.295]  So then they don't arrest him after a 30 minute confrontation, but they sent over 20 police cars to his house and were waiting for him to come out and get in the car.
[00:09:42.776 --> 00:09:47.539]  And they tell him, well, you went to the grocery store on March 12th.
[00:09:49.147 --> 00:09:50.248]  And did not wear a mask.
[00:09:50.268 --> 00:09:51.770]  And of course, there is no law.
[00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:57.578]  It's a, quote, regulation that just comes out of the provincial governors.
[00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:00.461]  And of course, they take the directive of the United Nations.
[00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:01.402]  So do you know what this is?
[00:10:02.773 --> 00:10:09.735]  Whether you live in Australia or Canada or in blue cities in the US, whether you live in Germany, whether you live in Scotland, Ireland, England, doesn't matter.
[00:10:10.495 --> 00:10:16.957]  The UN says what is okay, they say what the policies are, and then our governments follow them.
[00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.838]  And so literally you don't need UN troops with blue helmets showing up.
[00:10:22.113 --> 00:10:26.577]  The police and the military are being put through the woke system.
[00:10:26.597 --> 00:10:28.058]  They're being marinated in it everywhere.
[00:10:28.078 --> 00:10:33.102]  And then they're being given these jobs to go out and do unconstitutional, authoritarian things.
[00:10:33.162 --> 00:10:35.664]  And this is how they disappear you in the future.
[00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:38.506]  And it was Australia a few months ago.
[00:10:38.546 --> 00:10:39.647]  Now it's Canada and the U.S.
[00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:40.087]  today.
[00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:41.669]  We're in blue cities.
[00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:50.496]  They're coming and arresting people that organize constitutional demonstrations against the illegal, unlawful mask mandates.
[00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:54.927]  And now they're rolling out the COVID passports.
[00:10:55.708 --> 00:10:56.568]  That's now official.
[00:10:56.588 --> 00:10:59.110]  And now they're rolling out the global social credit score.
[00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:05.413]  Now they're telling the military, actually, starting in July, these gene therapies will be mandatory.
[00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:08.595]  And so that's what this is.
[00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:15.719]  This is you in control, taking control of our very civilization and of our society.
[00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.540]  And I'm going to be
[00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:23.242]  Interviewing Chris Sky coming up in about T-minus 19 and a half minutes.
[00:11:23.342 --> 00:11:32.715]  So, we'll also play you some of the shocking excerpts of the video that is online at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, but this is so dire.
[00:11:34.417 --> 00:11:38.700]  When you can't say, hey, mRNA vaccines never got approved.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.381]  They've been around for over a decade.
[00:11:40.421 --> 00:11:48.086]  They tested them in animals that destroyed the immune systems of many animals, turned off the immune systems or turned them way up where their organs liquefied.
[00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:53.350]  And you had the most prestigious scientific groups coming out and saying we should never authorize these.
[00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:59.715]  And then Bill Gates and the UN and Fauci and the Chi-Coms, who are already doing all this in China, launch this.
[00:11:59.775 --> 00:12:00.896]  And that's what they talk about.
[00:12:01.277 --> 00:12:02.678]  Oh, we have super soldiers.
[00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:08.544]  They've been injecting their troops for decades with gene-edited, CRISPR-style technology.
[00:12:09.765 --> 00:12:13.689]  And they go, oh, you're not guinea pigs, you're super soldiers.
[00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.692]  And they inject them to, quote, have a special
[00:12:20.285 --> 00:12:20.965]  We're good to go.
[00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:37.910]  Of being able to go into your body, now they're saying, 10 shots a year.
[00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:46.417]  And they're admitting, oh, it'll actually turn off your regular immune system for every new virus, every new cold virus, every new flu virus, every, you'll have to go get a shot.
[00:12:47.258 --> 00:12:50.160]  So they're turning us into the boy in the bubble.
[00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:58.968]  That's actually the articles I have, mainstream headlines, mRNA vaccines and gene therapies triggered
[00:13:00.103 --> 00:13:04.604]  Cancers and quote boy-in-the-bubble scenarios.
[00:13:04.624 --> 00:13:09.206]  That's a true story that the boy that didn't have an immune system, anything and everything would kill him.
[00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:09.986]  He had to live in a bubble.
[00:13:10.967 --> 00:13:12.527]  We show you the famous footage of that.
[00:13:12.987 --> 00:13:14.308]  That's bullet boy in the bubble footage.
[00:13:15.688 --> 00:13:16.968]  That's what this is.
[00:13:17.068 --> 00:13:23.571]  So they're making you a commodity that they completely and totally control.
[00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:26.331]  And so this is a revolution.
[00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:27.552]  This is the final revolution.
[00:13:29.805 --> 00:13:30.725]  It's what they call it.
[00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:36.950]  And so I'm going to spend some time on that today after Chris Sky comes and joins us.
[00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.671]  Then I'll hit that at the beginning of the next hour.
[00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:39.992]  A huge news.
[00:13:40.692 --> 00:13:46.256]  And then we will go to your phone calls throughout the broadcast.
[00:13:46.376 --> 00:13:48.257]  There's also the big news, obviously.
[00:13:50.518 --> 00:13:55.702]  And that is that Putin called
[00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:04.411]  Skeletor's bluff and said, listen, I wish you well, wish you good health.
[00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:08.134]  You're talking about, you know, seeing a Cold Stone killer look in the mirror.
[00:14:09.195 --> 00:14:10.455]  And I'd like to debate you.
[00:14:10.556 --> 00:14:13.998]  And Biden said he's too busy, too busy dealing with COVID.
[00:14:14.038 --> 00:14:15.779]  He means playing Mario Kart and drooling.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.902]  And he's now on video again, falling down, stumbling.
[00:14:20.263 --> 00:14:21.364]  That video's next segment.
[00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:28.129]  We've also got the video of him calling Kamala Harris, President Harris, yet, yet again.
[00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:31.410]  So this is all just emblematic of who we are.
[00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:39.653]  We all wear our little masks as a symbol that we're dirty and we're evil.
[00:14:40.973 --> 00:14:48.876]  This is all a giant Milgram experiment, PSYOP, and our putting up with it only encourages the globalists.
[00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:51.157]  But I will tell you this, the globalists will pay.
[00:14:51.197 --> 00:14:52.158]  They will go down for this.
[00:14:52.758 --> 00:14:55.899]  It's the nature of history, the nature of tyrants, the nature of megalomaniacs.
[00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:58.220]  They're going to push and push and push until
[00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:04.301]  They themselves destroyed them along with a lot of us, obviously.
[00:15:05.936 --> 00:15:09.119]  Separately, please do not forget that we are Lister-supported.

[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.521]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to this live Friday, March 19th Global Transmission.
[00:16:08.762 --> 00:16:11.983]  Okay, I want to plunge back into COVID-19 because that's everything.
[00:16:12.023 --> 00:16:19.425]  That's the world government, that's the takeover, that's the medical tyranny, that's the global tracking, the tracing, that's the gene therapy, the gene editing.
[00:16:20.485 --> 00:16:25.247]  And we know from scientists that have been involved developing this stuff that they said it should not be approved in humans.
[00:16:25.867 --> 00:16:31.229]  It gives rise to cancer, it gives rise to sterilization, it just gives rise to a cornucopia of evil.
[00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:37.212]  And they now admit does not protect you from any of the COVID-19 style coronaviruses.
[00:16:37.953 --> 00:16:40.735]  And you've still got to wear a mask and you still can't congregate.
[00:16:41.035 --> 00:16:42.156]  It's just a total fraud.
[00:16:42.796 --> 00:16:47.939]  And it's a fraud up front, but people buy into the fraud, throw their logic out and say, I'm a hero.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.000]  It's Halloween.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.081]  I'm wearing a mask.
[00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:51.522]  I'm wearing two masks.
[00:16:51.562 --> 00:16:52.402]  I'm wearing three masks.
[00:16:52.462 --> 00:16:53.263]  I'm wearing a visor.
[00:16:55.114 --> 00:17:05.679]  And they've got you, but here's a big Zero Hedge article that's linked to Axios and a bunch of mainstream news, even admitting all this, that's what's crazy, is that all the places in the U.S.
[00:17:05.719 --> 00:17:12.822]  with the highest level of vaccination rates also have the highest level suddenly of saying that people that have COVID are dying of COVID.
[00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:22.446]  And you heard the callers, oh yeah, my dad died, or my boss died after they got the second Moderna shot, the second Pfizer shot,
[00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.997]  But then they said that they died of COVID.
[00:17:25.617 --> 00:17:26.037]  Bingo!
[00:17:26.317 --> 00:17:29.538]  People that get the vaccine that are testing positive for COVID a month later.
[00:17:29.898 --> 00:17:31.039]  It's a fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:33.700]  But what did even NPR say?
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.120]  What did the top scientists say?
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.461]  That I've been harping on for weeks.
[00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:43.444]  It goes in and creates deadly strains of real coronaviruses in your cells.
[00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:46.545]  Then you spew these off.
[00:17:47.205 --> 00:17:48.485]  And then they have their new strains.
[00:17:48.605 --> 00:17:50.726]  And so there's going to be real strains of this.
[00:17:50.746 --> 00:17:52.467]  There's going to be real killer viruses now.
[00:17:53.933 --> 00:18:03.058]  For anybody that doesn't have vitamin D, vitamin C, or zinc, because any virus will kill you without it, much less these new strains that are being created.
[00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:06.240]  Now let's move on to children.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:18.367]  What did the British government say in its quick study, since it wasn't tested on animals, they did live guinea pig testing on hundreds of thousands of people, and they said you should not give it to old people above 75, not to pregnant women, and not to under 16.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.961]  And it grows all these weird tumors.
[00:18:21.981 --> 00:18:23.222]  I tell you, don't worry about those tumors.
[00:18:23.623 --> 00:18:24.703]  It's only a puma.
[00:18:26.185 --> 00:18:27.065]  None of this makes sense.
[00:18:27.085 --> 00:18:27.806]  It's all dystopic.
[00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:30.328]  Well, they had to start killing us at one point.
[00:18:30.388 --> 00:18:32.590]  Everything else has been just getting ready for this.
[00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.671]  This is just setting the table.
[00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:39.716]  The fluoride in the water, the GMO, the glyphosates, the breast cancer exploding, the tens of millions of autistic.
[00:18:41.377 --> 00:18:42.498]  And they got away with that.
[00:18:43.979 --> 00:18:47.442]  You don't think Johnson & Johnson didn't know their baby powder gave babies lung cancer?
[00:18:49.175 --> 00:18:52.259]  Look, these guys are all in the eugenics movement.
[00:18:53.241 --> 00:18:54.342]  It's a mission for them.
[00:18:56.065 --> 00:18:59.209]  They're the ones putting all the opiates out, the ones selling us all the different poisons.
[00:19:00.411 --> 00:19:03.856]  And so now they're moving after the children.
[00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:08.524]  Because if they can hit a baby, they can say, oh, the baby was always dim.
[00:19:08.584 --> 00:19:09.805]  The baby was always simple.
[00:19:10.426 --> 00:19:22.096]  If they can hit you when you're a newborn or six months old, it's not as obvious at the third round for boys at 18 months where they have the convulsion at the hospital, or at the clinic, or in the car, and then are autistic for the rest of their lives.
[00:19:22.636 --> 00:19:23.717]  That's a little too obvious.
[00:19:23.737 --> 00:19:27.801]  They've got a brain damage early in their culling op.
[00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:28.522]  And again,
[00:19:29.741 --> 00:19:31.362]  Those vaccines aren't given in China.
[00:19:31.682 --> 00:19:34.404]  They're given in the countries that they want to sabotage and bring down.
[00:19:34.524 --> 00:19:38.806]  South Korea, Europe, the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, and that's where you have all the numbers.
[00:19:39.627 --> 00:19:43.849]  So these are things to weigh down our society, weigh down the parents, and destroy everything.
[00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.371]  See, and boys have a blood-brain barrier half the strength of girls.
[00:19:48.232 --> 00:19:53.575]  Any doctor will tell you, and they knew this in the time of the Greeks, that females are more hardy than men.
[00:19:54.275 --> 00:19:54.675]  Men can
[00:19:56.204 --> 00:20:01.925]  Fight, lift more weights, have more stamina, and have more mental stamina under pressure.
[00:20:02.306 --> 00:20:08.987]  But the body of a woman, because they can carry a baby, can take more poison per pound, lose more blood per pound.
[00:20:09.647 --> 00:20:10.188]  It's a fact.
[00:20:10.608 --> 00:20:15.389]  Ask any doctor that female fetuses, female babies, are twice as strong as male babies.
[00:20:16.169 --> 00:20:22.672]  And again, it escalates where some Africans have the highest level of stamina, and then men have the highest level of stamina.
[00:20:22.852 --> 00:20:25.453]  That's why all the world champion runners are black.
[00:20:25.773 --> 00:20:27.394]  It's a fact.
[00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:32.196]  Black males are even higher level of autism because their blood-brain barrier is even thinner.
[00:20:32.736 --> 00:20:36.617]  Because a Ferrari, again, is a high-tuned engine, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:37.518 --> 00:20:38.778]  So that's how this works.
[00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:40.459]  And all the statistics are there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:41.379 --> 00:20:42.800]  So it hits men worse than anybody.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.000]  And who's it hurt the worst?
[00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:44.981]  Black men.
[00:20:48.393 --> 00:21:00.703]  And so if you're a world champion middleweight boxer, marvelous Marvin Hagler, and you've got not much of a blood-brain barrier because you're also a boxer, what happens when you take that shot?
[00:21:02.124 --> 00:21:03.225]  Deader than a doornail.
[00:21:03.245 --> 00:21:04.727]  But I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:21:05.007 --> 00:21:12.413]  Let's go to the Monster Fauci saying babies need the vaccine and they're doing the illegal trials on babies and children now.
[00:21:12.713 --> 00:21:14.335]  This is Joseph Mingle at Level, here it is.
[00:21:15.882 --> 00:21:24.586]  For high school students, it looks like they will be available to get vaccinated in the beginning of the fall, very likely for the fall term.
[00:21:25.046 --> 00:21:30.829]  With regard to children, we're doing an age de-escalation study.
[00:21:31.329 --> 00:21:39.239]  In elementary school children from 12 to 9, 9 to 6, 6 to 2, and 6 months to 2 years.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:46.168]  We anticipate we'll have enough data to be able to vaccinate these younger children by the first quarter of 2022.
[00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:53.257]  And of course they always fix the data and take the deaths out of the study and always claim it was something else.
[00:21:53.658 --> 00:21:58.621]  A true monster who needs to pay for his crimes with Life in Prison at Supermax with Bill Gates.
[00:21:59.162 --> 00:22:03.565]  Here is a real doctor, Rand Paul, grilling the monster again yesterday.
[00:22:05.273 --> 00:22:08.555]  No evidence that there are significant reinfections after vaccine.
[00:22:08.596 --> 00:22:15.401]  In fact, I don't think we have a hospitalization in the United States after the two-week period after the second vaccination.
[00:22:15.741 --> 00:22:17.582]  We don't have a death in the United States.
[00:22:18.263 --> 00:22:21.005]  You're not hearing what I'm saying about variants.
[00:22:21.165 --> 00:22:26.269]  We're talking about wild-type versus variants.
[00:22:26.289 --> 00:22:31.953]  And what proof is there that there are significant reinfections with hospitalizations and death from the variants?
[00:22:32.353 --> 00:22:33.254]  None in our country.
[00:22:33.414 --> 00:22:33.814]  Zero.
[00:22:34.014 --> 00:22:37.697]  Well, because we don't have a prevalent of a variant yet.
[00:22:37.837 --> 00:22:41.620]  We're having 117 that's becoming more dominant.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.163]  You're making a policy based on conjecture.
[00:22:46.263 --> 00:22:48.245]  It isn't based on conjecture.
[00:22:48.545 --> 00:22:51.047]  So you won't be able to wear a mask for another couple years.
[00:22:51.427 --> 00:22:54.770]  You've been vaccinated and you parade around in two masks.
[00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:55.910]  For show.
[00:22:56.271 --> 00:22:56.431]  No.
[00:22:56.471 --> 00:22:57.851]  You can't get it again.
[00:22:57.891 --> 00:23:03.935]  There's virtually zero percent chance you're going to get it, and yet you're telling people that have had the vaccine, who have immunity.
[00:23:04.235 --> 00:23:08.557]  You're defying everything we know about immunity by telling people to wear masks who've been vaccinated.
[00:23:08.677 --> 00:23:15.101]  Instead, you should be saying there is no science to say we're going to have a problem from the large number of people who have been vaccinated.
[00:23:15.121 --> 00:23:16.722]  You want to get rid of vaccine hesitancy?
[00:23:17.102 --> 00:23:19.724]  Tell them they can quit wearing their mask after they get the vaccine.
[00:23:19.744 --> 00:23:20.885]  You want people to get the vaccine?
[00:23:21.185 --> 00:23:27.290]  Give them a reward instead of telling them that the nanny state's gonna be there for three more years and you gotta wear a mask forever.
[00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.391]  People don't want to hear it.
[00:23:28.431 --> 00:23:29.752]  There's no science behind it.
[00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:34.216]  Well, let me just state for the record that masks are not theater.
[00:23:34.756 --> 00:23:36.137]  Masks are protective.
[00:23:36.517 --> 00:23:38.319]  And we have immunity there, theater.
[00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:41.661]  If you already have immunity, you're wearing a mask to give comfort to others.
[00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:43.903]  You're not wearing a mask because of any science.
[00:23:44.584 --> 00:23:45.785]  I totally disagree with you.
[00:23:46.664 --> 00:23:47.044]  That's enough.
[00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:57.348]  Fauci wrote an article, a scientific paper in 2008, saying masks don't work, and that it gives rise to bacterial pneumonia and kills more people, Spanish flu, 1918.
[00:23:57.928 --> 00:24:00.749]  And he then said early last year, don't wear masks, they don't help.
[00:24:00.769 --> 00:24:01.649]  Because it's a fact.
[00:24:02.189 --> 00:24:04.450]  In fact, people say it's like a chain-link fence, shooting a baby through it.
[00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.151]  It's actually, I did the math and looked at it.
[00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:13.393]  It's like having, on average, a 300-foot wide chain-link fence, each area of it wide, and you shoot a baby down it.
[00:24:13.913 --> 00:24:14.794]  Yeah, it's a joke.
[00:24:16.775 --> 00:24:23.360]  It's pure crap, and a lot of studies show it actually makes the globulins of water bigger, and so it actually helps carry viruses.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.002]  It's a damn filthy diaper on your face!
[00:24:28.323 --> 00:24:34.608]  So, Cyrus Jones, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:40.912]  We're 33 minutes in to the first hour of this Live Friday transmission.
[00:24:40.952 --> 00:24:44.975]  I'll open the phones up the second, third, and fourth hour, and we'll cover the waterfront.
[00:24:45.055 --> 00:24:46.296]  There's so much to get to, but
[00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:55.665]  If you're ever going to have a world government, a corporate world government, the best way to do it is build it around medicine, because people tend to submit to medical tyranny.
[00:24:55.685 --> 00:25:08.176]  And if you want to have a genetic revolution of the forced takeover of the human cells... Remember back in the day people were mad at Monsanto having all these seed lines that wouldn't produce seeds that produce new plants?
[00:25:08.196 --> 00:25:10.698]  So you had to go back to Monsanto each time just to get seeds?
[00:25:12.858 --> 00:25:20.504]  Well, by the year 2045, the UN and all the rest of them estimate, with pleasure, that we'll be completely sterile, unable to have children.
[00:25:20.524 --> 00:25:26.029]  But they say, don't worry, we'll create humanoids for you and implant those and grow them in a tank.
[00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.471]  We're talking about the children of men here.
[00:25:30.252 --> 00:25:37.098]  We're talking about a scientific takeover, a corporate takeover of the very body of humanity, telling us humans are obsolete.
[00:25:37.118 --> 00:25:38.158]  We're going to merge the machines.
[00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:39.760]  The singularity is coming.
[00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:44.671]  Long before the hypothetical singularity comes, they have to bring us under their control.
[00:25:44.691 --> 00:25:49.294]  So remember Loretta Lynch when she wasn't having tarmac meetings with Bill Clinton about the Justice Department investigations?
[00:25:51.855 --> 00:25:56.218]  She said we need the UN to run our police departments and have a woke system.
[00:25:58.179 --> 00:26:04.003]  And now all over the world, governments follow the exact directives of the United Nations.
[00:26:06.038 --> 00:26:06.638]  And if the U.N.
[00:26:06.658 --> 00:26:08.078]  says take the vaccine, you better do it.
[00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:08.839]  And if the U.N.
[00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:10.059]  says no side effects, it's true.
[00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:10.759]  And if the U.N.
[00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:11.819]  says no deaths, it's true.
[00:26:12.139 --> 00:26:12.739]  And if the U.N.
[00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:17.120]  says mRNA vaccines aren't gene therapy, even though in all the literature they are, well, it isn't.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.541]  You must only say what they said or keep your mouth shut.
[00:26:23.102 --> 00:26:31.363]  And now on top of it, all over the world, we're told the WHO, the gold standard, why they said so.
[00:26:32.163 --> 00:26:34.064]  And the Strong City Initiative, they're going to run our police.
[00:26:34.923 --> 00:26:35.966]  They're gonna run our military.
[00:26:35.986 --> 00:26:37.730]  They're gonna run our medicine.
[00:26:39.234 --> 00:26:41.479]  They're gonna run every single bit of it.
[00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:42.341]  They have done it.
[00:26:43.871 --> 00:26:46.313]  All they gotta do is get rid of Trump, Bolsonaro, and a few others.
[00:26:46.333 --> 00:26:49.075]  And hell, Trump went along with the vaccines, thinking it's just a regular vaccine.
[00:26:49.815 --> 00:26:51.276]  Thinking, oh, we're held hostage by the fear?
[00:26:51.597 --> 00:26:53.198]  Let's just take the shot and get out of the fear.
[00:26:53.218 --> 00:26:55.699]  Like Senator Paul said, but it's not just a regular shot.
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:02.424]  It goes in and changes the very protein inside your cells so they can't suppress cancer, and so you can't suppress other illnesses.
[00:27:02.444 --> 00:27:03.605]  That's in the mainline literature.
[00:27:03.885 --> 00:27:07.228]  This is a ghastly takeover to destroy your immune system bare minimum.
[00:27:07.748 --> 00:27:10.970]  And the numbers of deaths are just rising and rising and rising.
[00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:17.174]  This is a very dangerous criminal group that just seethe and ooze with it.
[00:27:18.675 --> 00:27:36.546]  Now, I'm a busy man in the morning, a busy boy, a busy beaver, and I didn't have 30 minutes to watch, but I watched the whole thing of Chris Sky, backtowork.bz, Instagram, real Chris Sky, of them at his house, in the dark, 20 plus police cars,
[00:27:38.188 --> 00:27:41.910]  And they're the traffic, they're not the traffic police, they're the code enforcers.
[00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.892]  That in Europe and Canada they've turned into regular police, now they're doing it here in Texas too, in Austin.
[00:27:47.292 --> 00:27:49.934]  But they don't even have the power to arrest him, it was just a summons to court.
[00:27:50.894 --> 00:27:55.196]  And he gets in their face, he backs them down, but this is police under UN edicts.
[00:27:55.236 --> 00:27:59.878]  They admit in these different provinces, we played the videos, that they take orders from the UN.
[00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:03.440]  And hell, their Prime Minister says he takes orders from Xi Jinping!
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:04.941]  Played the clip yesterday!
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.642]  Even the National Post said, well, he did praise dictatorship.
[00:28:08.682 --> 00:28:09.802]  They said, well, maybe that's good.
[00:28:11.003 --> 00:28:12.404]  So that's what this is.
[00:28:12.444 --> 00:28:13.105]  It isn't coming.
[00:28:13.365 --> 00:28:13.665]  It's here.
[00:28:13.705 --> 00:28:18.768]  Here's a few minutes of Chris Sky just a few hours ago last night.
[00:28:19.409 --> 00:28:20.549]  And it was early in the morning.
[00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:21.230]  We'll find out from him.
[00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.631]  He's in his boss's car going to work.
[00:28:23.932 --> 00:28:26.253]  And this is what the 20 of them waiting outside his house.
[00:28:26.553 --> 00:28:27.214]  This is what happened.
[00:28:30.054 --> 00:28:30.635]  What did I do?
[00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:31.676]  What's the common nuisance?
[00:28:31.696 --> 00:28:32.297]  What did I do?
[00:28:32.357 --> 00:28:32.657]  Tell me!
[00:28:32.677 --> 00:28:34.338]  I'm not getting out of the car until you tell me!
[00:28:34.719 --> 00:28:35.439]  I'm not getting out!
[00:28:35.479 --> 00:28:35.680]  Look!
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.560]  Cop there!
[00:28:37.001 --> 00:28:37.421]  Cop there!
[00:28:37.461 --> 00:28:38.942]  I'm not getting out of the f***ing car!
[00:28:38.963 --> 00:28:39.823]  You're on my property!
[00:28:39.863 --> 00:28:40.864]  Get off my property!
[00:28:41.305 --> 00:28:42.606]  Everybody's watching this right now!
[00:28:42.646 --> 00:28:43.186]  It's live!
[00:28:43.647 --> 00:28:44.127]  It's live!
[00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:45.629]  And I'm gonna bring people in the live!
[00:28:46.309 --> 00:28:47.370]  I mean, this is.
[00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.551]  What disturbance?
[00:28:48.571 --> 00:28:49.692]  You said I caused a disturbance.
[00:28:49.732 --> 00:28:50.753]  I'm not getting out of the car.
[00:28:51.053 --> 00:28:52.314]  Call 911, everybody.
[00:28:52.334 --> 00:28:53.895]  Report this to York Region PD.
[00:28:54.256 --> 00:28:54.896]  Call the news.
[00:28:55.036 --> 00:28:55.857]  Call everybody.
[00:28:55.877 --> 00:28:57.178]  I want everybody to see this.
[00:28:57.658 --> 00:28:59.020]  I am not getting out of the car.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.661]  They're trying to illegally arrest me.
[00:29:00.681 --> 00:29:01.922]  They're saying I caused a disturbance.
[00:29:01.962 --> 00:29:02.823]  I haven't done anything.
[00:29:03.043 --> 00:29:04.064]  What disturbance did I cause?
[00:29:04.084 --> 00:29:04.584]  What date?
[00:29:04.704 --> 00:29:06.246]  From March 12th when you were at Longo's.
[00:29:06.606 --> 00:29:07.727]  March 12th at Longo's?
[00:29:07.747 --> 00:29:07.847]  Yeah.
[00:29:08.087 --> 00:29:09.208]  How did I cause a disturbance?
[00:29:09.248 --> 00:29:12.751]  I claimed a mask exemption, and I did my shopping, and I left.
[00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:13.912]  So you cannot arrest me.
[00:29:13.932 --> 00:29:14.813]  I'm not getting out of the car.
[00:29:15.373 --> 00:29:16.816]  Everyone has that on video.
[00:29:17.117 --> 00:29:19.301]  I claim the mask exemption at Longo's.
[00:29:19.521 --> 00:29:21.585]  I did my shopping legally and left.
[00:29:21.805 --> 00:29:23.288]  That is not causing a disturbance.
[00:29:23.569 --> 00:29:25.172]  That is not causing a disturbance.
[00:29:25.192 --> 00:29:26.254]  That is not trespassing.
[00:29:26.514 --> 00:29:27.576]  I am not getting out of the car.
[00:29:28.723 --> 00:29:30.184]  I'll sign it under duress.
[00:29:30.384 --> 00:29:36.686]  I want everybody to know, they're forcing me to sign an illegal document under duress, so it's not legally binding, but I'll sign it, give it to me.
[00:29:37.027 --> 00:29:37.747]  Let me get a pen first.
[00:29:37.767 --> 00:29:47.371]  Oh yeah, see, they're gonna try to make me sign an illegal document for an illegal arrest, so they can try to put more conditions on me, so they can try to silence me from speaking, because they don't want me to say things like,
[00:29:48.109 --> 00:29:52.932]  Hashtag, just say no, because they know that that's going to ruin their little agenda.
[00:29:53.332 --> 00:29:53.952]  And they see?
[00:29:54.072 --> 00:29:55.493]  See how far they go, people?
[00:29:55.773 --> 00:29:56.814]  See what they try to do?
[00:29:57.094 --> 00:29:59.355]  See how many laws they try to break?
[00:29:59.955 --> 00:30:01.176]  You understand how this works?
[00:30:01.536 --> 00:30:08.120]  So this is why we need united non-compliance and balls of iron.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.120]  Understand?
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.463]  I want everybody to see this is the kind of firepower they brought to my house.
[00:30:14.083 --> 00:30:15.144]  I want everybody to see it.
[00:30:15.164 --> 00:30:16.344]  Half of them have already left.
[00:30:16.865 --> 00:30:17.265]  Look at this.
[00:30:18.365 --> 00:30:18.745]  Look at this!
[00:30:19.086 --> 00:30:22.028]  They even blocked off, they even blocked off Keele Street!
[00:30:22.388 --> 00:30:24.609]  They blocked off both sides of Keele Street!
[00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:24.909]  Look!
[00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:26.210]  Look at this, guys!
[00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:27.451]  Look at this!
[00:30:27.471 --> 00:30:31.814]  They blocked off the entire... There are police cars going back.
[00:30:31.854 --> 00:30:33.195]  It looks like 300 yards.
[00:30:33.215 --> 00:30:34.636]  You can see them way off in the distance.
[00:30:35.517 --> 00:30:36.637]  This is totally insane.
[00:30:36.657 --> 00:30:37.278]  It goes on and on.
[00:30:37.318 --> 00:30:38.539]  He shows at least 20 cars.
[00:30:39.179 --> 00:30:46.344]  Joining us is the thought criminal, Chris Sky, who's all over international news, who's been exposing the tyranny, who last year predicted that they would
[00:30:46.804 --> 00:30:48.305]  Okay, so I was actually coming home from the gym.
[00:30:48.325 --> 00:30:49.546]  I finished the gym at around midnight.
[00:31:17.128 --> 00:31:20.349]  And I was driving my boss's truck, which is very similar to my truck.
[00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:22.129]  I drive a white Range Rover, and so does he.
[00:31:22.489 --> 00:31:25.669]  I gave my car to an employee that day, so I ended up taking this truck.
[00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:32.111]  I was on my way home, I was getting shadowed by the OPP, which is the Ontario Provincial Police, which I thought was strange.
[00:31:32.571 --> 00:31:39.272]  They pulled me over, basically just to do an identity check on me, and asked me where I was going, which I thought was strange, with three cop cars.
[00:31:39.812 --> 00:31:43.592]  But then they identified me, they didn't say I was doing anything wrong, no speeding or nothing like that.
[00:31:44.153 --> 00:31:45.733]  So they basically said, you're free to go!
[00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:46.413]  Oh, sorry.
[00:31:47.793 --> 00:31:57.878]  So I left, and one of them started following me, and he followed me right till I got to Keele Street, which is where I live, and then he backed off, so I was like, okay, maybe they just wanted to make sure I was going home.
[00:31:58.578 --> 00:32:12.185]  So I got to my house, I was in my driveway, I have a gate that's manual, so I was about to get out of the car and open the gate, and somebody in plain clothes that doesn't identify themselves shines a flashlight, and so I roll down the window, and they say, I'm under arrest, get out of the car.
[00:32:13.165 --> 00:32:14.946]  Right away, I knew it was some kind of
[00:32:15.322 --> 00:32:22.227]  Corrupt, bogus, off-the-books raid, because if they had me under arrest, that means they had a warrant for my arrest.
[00:32:22.467 --> 00:32:32.033]  And if they had a warrant for my arrest, when I just got pulled over 10 minutes ago by the OPP, they would have told me right there when they ran my name and ID, hey, you got an arrest warrant, we're gonna take you.
[00:32:32.597 --> 00:32:34.579]  So I knew right away there was something fishy.
[00:32:34.859 --> 00:32:38.743]  I knew right away that they were basically just trying to kidnap me and get me to go along with it.
[00:32:39.063 --> 00:32:40.184]  So I said, what's the charge?
[00:32:40.345 --> 00:32:40.985]  What am I doing?
[00:32:41.366 --> 00:32:47.672]  And they tried to make it seem like it was about me going into a long goes a couple of weeks ago or not even a couple of weeks ago, like seven days ago.
[00:32:48.152 --> 00:32:55.479]  Where I went in without a mask, they tried to say they weren't going to serve me, I told them I had a medical exemption, which is the law, and they can't refuse to serve as bylaw.
[00:32:55.759 --> 00:33:01.745]  It's not even a criminal, it has nothing to do with criminal, it's a bylaw in the first place, so cops shouldn't even be involved, bylaw should be involved.
[00:33:02.005 --> 00:33:06.769]  And if bylaw went there, bylaw would tell them, you have to serve this young man, because that's the law.
[00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:11.894]  So I went in, they ended up giving me a bottle of maple syrup, I went to the till, I paid for it, and I left.
[00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:20.943]  Even if I had done something in the store that constituted a criminal charge, I think they said it was common nuisance and public mischief, something like that.
[00:33:21.323 --> 00:33:26.748]  In Canada, that's called a summary offense, which means it's only arrestable if it's caught in the act.
[00:33:27.048 --> 00:33:30.211]  So if I was there doing it and the cops came at that time, they could arrest me.
[00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:34.435]  So over 20 cop cars came to ambush you to teach you a lesson.
[00:33:34.455 --> 00:33:35.876]  We're going to talk about it when we come back.
[00:33:35.896 --> 00:33:38.378]  But again, this is the UN directing this.
[00:33:39.159 --> 00:33:40.340]  In control of your police.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.101]  It's absolutely out of control.
[00:33:42.361 --> 00:33:45.343]  People have to wake up to this being a global corporate takeover.
[00:33:45.763 --> 00:33:47.024]  We all follow China's lead.
[00:33:47.044 --> 00:33:47.625]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:48.385 --> 00:33:50.246]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:52.048 --> 00:33:54.249]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:55.530]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:01.474]  We're interviewing Chris Sky, a great activist, standing up against the global medical tyranny takeover.
[00:34:02.745 --> 00:34:11.348]  Now coming up next hour after he leaves us, I'm going to get to the disintegration of Biden, the Chinese openly scolding his minions on international TV in Alaska yesterday.
[00:34:13.329 --> 00:34:18.851]  Putin making a total fool out of Biden after Biden threatened him and said, we're going to get you and all this.
[00:34:19.331 --> 00:34:22.473]  Now Biden falls down twice going up the stairs.
[00:34:22.573 --> 00:34:26.254]  I mean, he is on another planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:27.575 --> 00:34:28.215]  I mean, wow.
[00:34:30.263 --> 00:34:33.085]  Oh, he tried to do that big fancy man, tough guy climb.
[00:34:34.725 --> 00:34:37.387]  And he fell down twice.
[00:34:39.608 --> 00:34:41.729]  This is all emblematic, all done on purpose.
[00:34:41.749 --> 00:34:43.330]  This is the guy they stole the election for.
[00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.151]  Simply insane.
[00:34:45.171 --> 00:34:47.272]  And he called Kamala Harris President Harris again.
[00:34:48.292 --> 00:34:49.733]  Hope the left's happy with what you've done.
[00:34:49.753 --> 00:34:50.713]  You want the country to go down?
[00:34:50.894 --> 00:34:51.394]  Well, it is.
[00:34:53.353 --> 00:35:01.238]  And they'll be so stupid, just like in Venezuela, they'll ask for more free stuff and more communism, and things will get worse, and they'll ask for more, and they'll get worse, because that's the nature of these people.
[00:35:01.258 --> 00:35:02.999]  They have a spiritual disease in their minds.
[00:35:03.439 --> 00:35:10.924]  Going back to Chris Sky, Chris, again, for people that don't know who you are, most people do, you're one of the leading activists exposing, predicting all this.
[00:35:10.944 --> 00:35:16.288]  In fact, cue up last year where he predicted that they'd bring the lockdowns back when he was, right when he got back from Ireland.
[00:35:17.944 --> 00:35:19.945]  Again, this is what's coming for everybody in the future.
[00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:22.906]  They admit in Canada they've built secret facilities.
[00:35:23.366 --> 00:35:30.708]  Now your Prime Minister makes you, for 14 days, go pay to be in a government hotel when you fly back to Canada, but the borders are wide open, basically.
[00:35:31.228 --> 00:35:32.288]  This is just insane.
[00:35:33.509 --> 00:35:40.311]  Where is all this going and why do they have to back down from saying you're under arrest, having to admit that you weren't under arrest?
[00:35:40.611 --> 00:35:41.371]  What were they thinking?
[00:35:42.251 --> 00:35:45.872]  Well, first of all, the most important part of this video is where it's going and why they were targeting me.
[00:35:45.892 --> 00:35:47.673]  So I'm just going to go real quick about what happened.
[00:35:48.132 --> 00:35:49.593]  Obviously it was an illegal police raid.
[00:35:49.633 --> 00:35:50.994]  Obviously I knew they didn't have authority.
[00:35:51.295 --> 00:35:57.600]  The way I held them accountable is I went on a live and I even asked any Canadians that were in the area to come there to support me.
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.643]  And sure enough, when they're on camera, they knew they couldn't touch me.
[00:36:00.843 --> 00:36:01.824]  They knew they couldn't arrest me.
[00:36:01.844 --> 00:36:02.965]  They knew I wasn't going to give in.
[00:36:03.505 --> 00:36:07.048]  And when dozens of actual Canadian patriots showed up,
[00:36:07.844 --> 00:36:09.345]  They literally chased the police away.
[00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:10.606]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:36:10.626 --> 00:36:11.467]  It was very touching.
[00:36:11.827 --> 00:36:14.609]  It was, it like, it made me inspired to be a Canadian.
[00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:18.632]  But the real thing we need to take away from this is not the police corruption.
[00:36:18.933 --> 00:36:21.134]  Not that this came from, I'll call them out right now.
[00:36:21.174 --> 00:36:24.877]  This was straight from John Tory, Mayor John Tory and Premier Doug Ford.
[00:36:25.037 --> 00:36:27.379]  And that's what everyone needs to blame if they want to blame somebody.
[00:36:27.399 --> 00:36:28.780]  So that's where this order came from.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.702]  But the reason is why I'm being targeted.
[00:36:30.742 --> 00:36:35.185]  And the reason I'm being targeted is because like you said, we're exposing this medical tyranny that they're trying to impose on us.
[00:36:35.525 --> 00:36:37.687]  And it's easy to expose when you know the endgame.
[00:36:37.727 --> 00:36:39.588]  And the endgame is the vaccine passport.
[00:36:39.928 --> 00:36:41.389]  They're openly talking about it now.
[00:36:41.669 --> 00:36:52.457]  And that's why, like you mentioned, they have these ridiculous travel restrictions where they want Canadians to pay for their own forcible confinement in a government quarantine facility full of potentially sick people and then go to their house.
[00:36:53.103 --> 00:36:54.224]  When you could just go to your house.
[00:36:54.384 --> 00:36:56.325]  And the government tries to pretend this is for your safety.
[00:36:56.385 --> 00:36:58.906]  Obviously it's not about for your safety, it's about controlling you.
[00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:07.751]  And by the way, I have three different provincial governors and leaders admitting they've got secret camps and they're grabbing people that have parties and stuff to punish them, taking them to those facilities.
[00:37:08.051 --> 00:37:10.312]  But then they have national news saying it doesn't exist.
[00:37:10.673 --> 00:37:16.676]  So we have the regional governors, we have the city councils admitting it, but then separately they say it doesn't exist.
[00:37:17.725 --> 00:37:20.006]  No, obviously they exist and obviously they're putting people in them.
[00:37:20.026 --> 00:37:21.507]  Some of them are known, some of them aren't known.
[00:37:21.547 --> 00:37:25.309]  They're even changing the locations of the ones that were known because they were getting too much publicity.
[00:37:25.689 --> 00:37:28.310]  But once again, the endgame is this vaccine passport.
[00:37:28.703 --> 00:37:30.344]  And they pretend it's about travel.
[00:37:30.604 --> 00:37:32.144]  It has really nothing to do with travel.
[00:37:32.364 --> 00:37:34.345]  They want to make it part of every facet of your life.
[00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:41.208]  If they can get compliance of about 75% of the population to go along with it, then vaccine passport will become mandatory for travel.
[00:37:41.328 --> 00:37:47.510]  Then it will become mandatory for work, for going to the gym, for going to a concert, a hockey game, basketball game, etc.
[00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:48.571]  And that's what they want.
[00:37:48.731 --> 00:37:54.373]  They want to be able to impose a medical tyranny on you where you have no choice but to take this mRNA
[00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:55.261]  I don't know.
[00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:20.077]  Just say no.
[00:38:20.337 --> 00:38:30.127]  And we're getting everybody on Instagram to make a wall post where they actually make a post or a video where they put the hashtag just say no in the post and then also in the caption hashtag just say no.
[00:38:30.508 --> 00:38:35.773]  And then if they want me to share it and follow them back, I tell them to make it a story and tag at real Chris Sky.
[00:38:36.153 --> 00:38:38.415]  And we're doing that on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, everywhere.
[00:38:38.675 --> 00:38:43.439]  And we're seeing people from all over the world make a Just Say No video.
[00:38:43.679 --> 00:38:45.821]  And we want so many people to make it that Just Say No.
[00:38:45.861 --> 00:38:47.483]  I'm glad I should have said this up front.
[00:38:47.503 --> 00:38:48.503]  That's why I wanted to get you on.
[00:38:48.543 --> 00:38:54.809]  You talked about this during the 30 minutes while the police or the goons are at your house, all 20 plus police cars, is we've got to fight back.
[00:38:55.009 --> 00:38:58.091]  Everybody should have their own testimony on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:38:58.131 --> 00:38:59.072]  So what if they're going to ban you?
[00:39:01.275 --> 00:39:02.057]  Everybody needs to do it.
[00:39:02.598 --> 00:39:05.564]  People need to get these videos out and they haven't banned you yet.
[00:39:05.944 --> 00:39:06.365]  Why is that?
[00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:07.267]  They can't ban you.
[00:39:07.407 --> 00:39:10.072]  How can they ban you for telling people that they have a choice to say no?
[00:39:11.166 --> 00:39:15.688]  They admit that they can't mandate this vaccine, so they're going to try to coerce you every which way possible.
[00:39:15.708 --> 00:39:20.531]  They're going to try to make your life as miserable as possible, so you're like, oh, I might as well just get it so we can go back to normal.
[00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:27.654]  No, you have rights, you have freedoms, you don't need- I'm trying to tell folks, tell folks, absolutely, the people working at big tech are going to be hit by all this as well.
[00:39:27.694 --> 00:39:30.675]  We've got to wake up at some point about this big pharma takeover.
[00:39:30.715 --> 00:39:31.696]  Tell people the hashtag again.
[00:39:32.799 --> 00:39:35.021]  It's hashtag just say no.
[00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:40.505]  And we want so many people to do it that that hashtag just say no becomes synonymous with just say no to the COVID vaccine.
[00:39:40.905 --> 00:39:48.131]  And once this becomes really well known, we're going to do real ads all over major American cities because we want people to ask those kinds of questions.
[00:39:48.151 --> 00:39:57.018]  Like, why are you, why are doctors saying to their patients that this vaccine is safe when there is absolutely no long term safety or efficacy data?
[00:39:57.278 --> 00:39:58.419]  It's not FDA approved.
[00:39:58.679 --> 00:40:02.522]  It never completed human trials, never even tried to go through animal trials.
[00:40:02.887 --> 00:40:07.890]  And it's a concoction that's never before been used on mankind and a grand scale ever.
[00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:15.295]  And we have a company like Moderna that's never even made a product ever for human consumption, made or distributed.
[00:40:15.515 --> 00:40:21.198]  And the first product ever that they make for mass inoculation is an experimental concoction that they're calling a vaccine.
[00:40:21.579 --> 00:40:25.341]  And we've seen already thousands and thousands of reports of hospitalizations.
[00:40:25.796 --> 00:40:26.476]  I don't think so.
[00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:50.081]  I think?
[00:41:10.286 --> 00:41:11.527]  Virtually every six months.
[00:41:11.748 --> 00:41:14.150]  And we know you have to take two shots every six months.
[00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:16.131]  So you're looking at four shots a year.
[00:41:16.412 --> 00:41:17.353]  So you can go to work.
[00:41:17.633 --> 00:41:18.454]  So you can travel.
[00:41:18.574 --> 00:41:20.115]  So you can go see your friends.
[00:41:20.175 --> 00:41:21.076]  And I always knew this.
[00:41:21.136 --> 00:41:22.557]  Gates a year ago said five shots.
[00:41:22.617 --> 00:41:25.280]  Now they're talking about, brother, you may have missed it, ten shots a year.
[00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:27.244]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:41:27.464 --> 00:41:30.528]  They already got babies getting 60 shots before they're 18 years old.
[00:41:30.728 --> 00:41:32.831]  When I was growing up, it was like something like 13.
[00:41:33.231 --> 00:41:34.593]  So, what do you think's gonna happen?
[00:41:34.613 --> 00:41:36.335]  Oh, that's straight off of the Twitter.
[00:41:36.555 --> 00:41:37.816]  So that's the Twitter version of it.
[00:41:37.856 --> 00:41:42.402]  People are just writing hashtag JustSayNo on the actual post and in the caption.
[00:41:42.442 --> 00:41:46.006]  It's very important to put it in the caption because then when people actually search that,
[00:41:46.847 --> 00:41:49.329]  All the Just Say No's that have ever been will go up.
[00:41:49.869 --> 00:41:53.512]  On Instagram there's about 280,000 posts with Just Say No.
[00:41:53.712 --> 00:41:56.334]  And I'm telling the listeners, this show is copyright free.
[00:41:56.955 --> 00:42:03.621]  Take this interview, cut it down however you want, take the key things that Chris has said here, and get this out as well.
[00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:05.442]  That's how we're changing the world.
[00:42:05.482 --> 00:42:08.505]  That's how you can really turn the tide against the globalists.
[00:42:10.307 --> 00:42:12.669]  Because everybody asks me every day, what can I do?
[00:42:12.709 --> 00:42:13.410]  But what can I do?
[00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:14.170]  But what can I do?
[00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:15.812]  So I said, this is something you can do.
[00:42:16.032 --> 00:42:19.975]  You can tell everybody that they're not alone in asking questions.
[00:42:19.995 --> 00:42:22.637]  They're not alone in questioning why we should take this vaccine.
[00:42:22.777 --> 00:42:24.939]  They're not alone in not wanting to take it.
[00:42:25.259 --> 00:42:28.322]  And when more and more people ask questions and more and more people raise this awareness,
[00:42:28.562 --> 00:42:32.244]  The idea of the vaccine passport becomes unpalpable for the general population.
[00:42:32.464 --> 00:42:33.164]  And that's what we need.
[00:42:33.184 --> 00:42:34.725]  Because that's their endgame.
[00:42:34.965 --> 00:42:38.066]  And these people that keep thinking, you have to comply to get through this.
[00:42:38.266 --> 00:42:39.166]  No, it doesn't work like that.
[00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:45.609]  Because if the vaccine passport is step 10, they got to go through step 1 through 9 before they can get to the vaccine passport.
[00:42:45.849 --> 00:42:49.450]  And every time you comply with the next step, they move to step 1, to step 2, to step 3.
[00:42:50.831 --> 00:42:56.156]  As soon as you don't comply with, say, step four, they can't move forward to the vaccine passport agenda.
[00:42:56.676 --> 00:42:58.017]  Chris, stay there.
[00:42:58.037 --> 00:42:59.459]  I want to do a couple more segments with you.
[00:42:59.479 --> 00:43:07.786]  I know you got to go and I got a bunch of news and calls to take, but you have been a visionary in the last year exposing all this and everything you talked about came true because you're reading their own documents.
[00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:09.748]  Explain to people when we come back.
[00:43:09.788 --> 00:43:10.428]  Take some time.
[00:43:11.129 --> 00:43:18.652]  To explain how they need you to submit through these processes, how we know it's staged, how they admit it is a process of bringing us into tyranny.
[00:43:18.672 --> 00:43:20.912]  Like the UK said, oh no, we're not going to have passports.
[00:43:20.952 --> 00:43:23.873]  Now they go, well, we are introducing them, but you don't have to have them.
[00:43:23.914 --> 00:43:25.314]  But next year, they'll be mandatory.
[00:43:25.654 --> 00:43:30.456]  Or they say, oh, don't worry, we're not going to make you wear bracelets.
[00:43:30.736 --> 00:43:31.656]  They're freedom bracelets.
[00:43:31.696 --> 00:43:33.817]  Now they pass a law in Israel to make people wear them.
[00:43:33.837 --> 00:43:35.778]  We're going to come right back to you in just a minute.
[00:43:36.078 --> 00:43:37.038]  Please remember, stay right there.
[00:43:39.912 --> 00:43:41.194]  Well that's it, they all do it.
[00:43:54.872 --> 00:43:56.933]  We'll be right back on the other side with Chris Sky.
[00:43:56.973 --> 00:43:59.694]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and Bandot Video.
[00:43:59.714 --> 00:44:03.215]  The whole fight is you spreading the word and the whole fight is you taking action.
[00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:22.261]  The response to COVID is a lot worse than COVID.
[00:44:22.641 --> 00:44:24.242]  And COVID isn't about a virus.
[00:44:24.302 --> 00:44:33.806]  It's about increasing government control over our lives by using fear tactics to make people comply with giving up the rights and freedoms that millions of people fought and died for.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:43.707]  Cool, and what do you say to the people, we spoke to some of the people across the street, they're saying you guys are all stupid, that a lot of them say mandatory masks outside is what they want.
[00:44:43.928 --> 00:44:46.650]  How do you respond to people who are against what you're standing for here today?
[00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:49.632]  Well, the fact of the matter is, I just came from Netherlands.
[00:44:50.053 --> 00:44:53.896]  The Dutch are not stupid people, they're smart, they're independent, and they have balls.
[00:44:54.316 --> 00:44:54.937]  So guess what?
[00:44:55.237 --> 00:44:56.138]  They have no masks.
[00:44:56.698 --> 00:44:58.139]  They have 17 million people.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.003]  If you go to a train station, maybe 1 out of 20 people is scared enough to wear a mask.
[00:45:03.524 --> 00:45:04.605]  Their bars are open.
[00:45:04.945 --> 00:45:06.266]  The girls are still working.
[00:45:06.486 --> 00:45:08.428]  You can go smoke a joint in their coffee shops.
[00:45:08.468 --> 00:45:09.749]  You can eat in their restaurants.
[00:45:10.089 --> 00:45:11.950]  They're open till 2 o'clock in the morning.
[00:45:12.291 --> 00:45:16.454]  And they've had less than 200 people up to age 60 die.
[00:45:16.674 --> 00:45:20.517]  Also, Amsterdam is one of the top 3 cities in all of Europe for international travel.
[00:45:21.138 --> 00:45:23.379]  50 million visitors a year from all over the world.
[00:45:23.539 --> 00:45:27.382]  This is a video of him in September of last year and he predicted that lockdowns...
[00:45:28.123 --> 00:45:29.023]  Would come back again.
[00:45:30.044 --> 00:45:34.386]  He's going to join me tomorrow for a special broadcast that's going to be taped to air.
[00:45:34.866 --> 00:45:35.627]  So it's like it's live.
[00:45:35.647 --> 00:45:36.767]  I'm going to start taping at noon.
[00:45:36.787 --> 00:45:38.088]  I'm going to go for two hours.
[00:45:38.988 --> 00:45:43.350]  Then we can add a lot of articles and documents that really boost the show up.
[00:45:43.811 --> 00:45:46.132]  And then it'll start streaming at taped air.
[00:45:46.172 --> 00:45:47.212]  It's like it's live, but it's not.
[00:45:47.652 --> 00:45:49.053]  At 4 p.m.
[00:45:49.593 --> 00:45:50.614]  Central tomorrow.
[00:45:50.654 --> 00:45:52.395]  That way it'll be basically commercial free.
[00:45:53.215 --> 00:45:55.676]  And streamed over the M4's network and any stations that want to pick it up.
[00:45:55.696 --> 00:45:57.356]  But everybody loves those Saturday shows.
[00:45:57.397 --> 00:45:58.257]  They always go viral.
[00:45:58.957 --> 00:46:02.798]  Because Saturday's a dead time, but there's actually not much media being put out on Saturday.
[00:46:02.818 --> 00:46:05.459]  So we find, so we put out on Saturday goes the most viral.
[00:46:06.299 --> 00:46:08.020]  So I appreciate Chris Guy coming on.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.501]  In the three minutes we've got now, we'll talk about it more tomorrow.
[00:46:11.121 --> 00:46:12.582]  You're a smart cookie.
[00:46:12.622 --> 00:46:14.222]  You laid out everything in the last year.
[00:46:14.622 --> 00:46:16.403]  What's coming next with these monsters?
[00:46:17.125 --> 00:46:18.866]  Oh my god, you read my friggin' mind.
[00:46:18.927 --> 00:46:20.348]  That's exactly what I wanted to talk about.
[00:46:20.368 --> 00:46:26.032]  Because right now, I've been trying to warn people, I did lives about this a couple months ago, to tell people this is gonna happen.
[00:46:26.573 --> 00:46:28.014]  They're gonna declare a third wave.
[00:46:28.054 --> 00:46:31.196]  They've already pretty much declared it with their mainstream media, even though there's nothing.
[00:46:31.216 --> 00:46:37.201]  They even started building a giant field hospital at Sunnybrook Hospital that's gonna be completely empty, unless the vaccinated people start getting sick.
[00:46:37.682 --> 00:46:37.842]  But!
[00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:39.823]  They're going to declare a third wave.
[00:46:39.943 --> 00:46:41.964]  They've already been pretending like they're trying to open us.
[00:46:42.004 --> 00:46:44.965]  In reality, it's the next bait and switch, and they're going to try to lock us down.
[00:46:45.205 --> 00:46:54.729]  They know that if they can lock us down now, they can lock us down until probably about May, and they're going to knock out another 10-15% of Canada's businesses, which is like chopping another arm off of the country.
[00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:56.189]  And that's their plan.
[00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:57.610]  Their plan is to not
[00:46:58.137 --> 00:47:02.700]  They're planning to let you think you're coming off this lockdown, but really they're going to declare this third wave in Canada.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.861]  I'm talking about Canada right now.
[00:47:04.081 --> 00:47:05.222]  I don't know about the rest of the world.
[00:47:05.262 --> 00:47:07.464]  Oh, they're doing it here for sure.
[00:47:07.664 --> 00:47:08.885]  I think they'll launch it in August.
[00:47:09.085 --> 00:47:11.126]  I think by August, they'll announce the third wave.
[00:47:11.146 --> 00:47:11.547]  What do you think?
[00:47:12.307 --> 00:47:14.669]  No, no, here they're already announcing it as we speak.
[00:47:14.789 --> 00:47:21.734]  Like, as I speak, they're announcing the so-called third wave in Canada, in Ontario right now, and probably by next week.
[00:47:22.341 --> 00:47:32.244]  Next week or yeah, probably next week they're going to start telling people that they're going to be pulling the emergency brake on opening and they're going to start rolling people back into what they call the gray zone.
[00:47:32.364 --> 00:47:32.565]  Sure.
[00:47:32.585 --> 00:47:38.266]  And then for us later, we're always six months behind you guys and other countries because they beta tested their first.
[00:47:38.327 --> 00:47:39.147]  I totally agree with you.
[00:47:39.367 --> 00:47:41.788]  Like I've seen them saying, oh, we may not be able to reopen.
[00:47:42.128 --> 00:47:43.628]  So again, they dangle in front of you.
[00:47:43.648 --> 00:47:47.970]  Well, it's like Biden said, maybe you can have a backyard cookout if you behave yourself on July 4th.
[00:47:49.537 --> 00:47:50.939]  Yeah, that's basically what they're telling you.
[00:47:50.959 --> 00:47:53.743]  They're basically telling you, sorry guys, it's too dangerous.
[00:47:53.763 --> 00:47:54.925]  It's too dangerous to open up.
[00:47:54.965 --> 00:47:56.287]  It's too dangerous to allow you to work.
[00:47:56.347 --> 00:47:58.630]  It's too dangerous to remove these travel restrictions.
[00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.973]  The answer is to recall every one of their asses.
[00:48:02.516 --> 00:48:05.177]  Yeah, we've got to hold every single one of them accountable.
[00:48:05.477 --> 00:48:07.817]  Remember when the masks were supposed to be for one month, people?
[00:48:08.077 --> 00:48:09.157]  Now it's been over a year.
[00:48:09.877 --> 00:48:11.658]  If the masks were going to work, they would have worked by now.
[00:48:11.918 --> 00:48:15.538]  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
[00:48:15.718 --> 00:48:19.479]  So now they're doubling down on the masks and they extended the mask mandate indefinitely.
[00:48:19.739 --> 00:48:21.439]  It doesn't even expire in 2022.
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.480]  So what do you think they're planning on doing?
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.780]  You think they're planning on giving you your lives and your freedoms back?
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:30.101]  Or you think they're planning on prolonging this year after year after year the longer they can get you to comply?
[00:48:30.681 --> 00:48:34.126]  I have people that, I ask people why they're complying and I have three different answers.
[00:48:34.486 --> 00:48:37.069]  One person, some people are afraid of the virus, that's very few.
[00:48:37.089 --> 00:48:40.513]  A lot of people are afraid of the government or afraid of getting kicked out of the store.
[00:48:40.854 --> 00:48:48.944]  And then the other very common answer, which is the most terrifying to me, and I want this to be the last thing people hear, is people say they just want to follow the rules.
[00:48:49.773 --> 00:48:52.736]  How do you follow rules that are 100% against your best interest?
[00:48:52.897 --> 00:48:57.322]  How do you follow rules that you know are going to destroy your family and ruin your child's future?
[00:48:57.342 --> 00:48:59.024]  That lead you to a horrible place.
[00:48:59.044 --> 00:48:59.905]  You're a hero, Chris.
[00:48:59.925 --> 00:49:02.828]  You make me feel better to know there are men and women like you out there.
[00:49:02.868 --> 00:49:03.309]  We love you.
[00:49:03.509 --> 00:49:04.590]  We'll talk to you tomorrow, sir.
[00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:05.071]  God bless.
[00:49:05.091 --> 00:49:05.531]  We'll be right back.
[00:49:06.232 --> 00:49:08.955]  What would happen if you gave Bill Gates truth serum?
[00:49:09.175 --> 00:49:23.949]  Well, really what you get, he admits he wants to depopulate the earth, wants to get rid of old people, thinks humans are horrible, his dad ran Planned Parenthood and the World Eugenics Society, his mother headed up the foundation of the founder of IBM for eugenics, he was the number two guy under Hitler, Thomas Watson.
[00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:25.410]  We're good to go.
[00:49:55.782 --> 00:49:57.283]  Hello, useless eaters.
[00:49:57.823 --> 00:50:09.752]  As your unqualified, non-elected global human health overlord, I'd like to take this opportunity to flaunt my position of power and influence over society and share some of my plans for you and your future.
[00:50:10.352 --> 00:50:12.994]  When I amassed my fortune in computer software,
[00:50:13.134 --> 00:50:21.100]  I demonstrated that I was willing to lie, steal code, cheat my partners, and exercise monopolistic control to destroy my competitors.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.503]  Now that I've retired, I can rebrand myself as a humanitarian.
[00:50:25.883 --> 00:50:37.572]  With my for-profit foundation MassGrading as a charity, I can advocate for population reduction and sponsor mass human experiments with unproven vaccines in vulnerable populations.
[00:50:38.132 --> 00:50:48.643]  Like my father, a powerful banker, eugenicist, and Rockefeller crony himself, it's always been my ambition to decide who lives and, more importantly, how many have to die.
[00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:57.592]  Whether it's under the guise of climate change or world health, it's really all about controlling and culling the human herd for fun and profit.
[00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:05.397]  In November of last year, I hosted Event 201, a war game simulation of a global pandemic.
[00:51:05.997 --> 00:51:17.501]  Leaders from private corporations, global banks, governments, and the media got together to strategize ways they could align and lockstep when responding to a worldwide health crisis.
[00:51:18.221 --> 00:51:31.505]  Using a coordinated campaign of fear-mongering, intimidation, social shaming, and economic blackmail, we realized that we could get around dangerous philosophies like individual liberty and national sovereignty.
[00:51:31.945 --> 00:51:46.550]  With an obedient population, we would be free to implement our own top-down solutions, like forced quarantines, social distancing, contact tracing, and mandatory testing, as a means to seize technocratic control of society.
[00:51:47.461 --> 00:51:53.727]  Now imagine my excitement when we had the opportunity to release, uh, declare our own global pandemic.
[00:51:54.048 --> 00:52:05.439]  It was my chance to look like the Nostradamus of public health and to position myself and business partners like Dr. Fauci as the de facto authorities on response and solutions.
[00:52:05.859 --> 00:52:15.207]  Through exaggerated doomsday scenarios and computer simulations, our petty control freaks instituted harsh rules and draconian lockdowns.
[00:52:15.808 --> 00:52:25.957]  Even after our dire predictions proved false, scared and well-meaning people continued to submit to the arbitrary and foolish demands of their so-called leaders.
[00:52:26.621 --> 00:52:39.084]  Having achieved global lockdown and medical martial law, we'll continue to hold hostage your ability to congregate, work, travel, or do just about anything until we're prepared to roll out our bigger plan.
[00:52:39.645 --> 00:52:44.546]  I'd like to call this Pandemic One, because believe me, we have others in the works.
[00:52:45.086 --> 00:52:52.552]  Our final solution is to have you begging for us to vaccinate, tag, and digitally track each one of you like livestock.
[00:52:52.812 --> 00:53:05.241]  Not only will my foundation enjoy legal immunity and trillions in profits, but these mandatory experimental vaccines will move us so much further down the road to absolute centralized global control.
[00:53:05.741 --> 00:53:11.165]  If only my good friend Jeffrey Epstein had been here to celebrate with me aboard the Lolita Express.
[00:53:11.986 --> 00:53:15.808]  So remember, global citizens, this will end when I say it ends.
[00:53:16.288 --> 00:53:19.430]  Could be a year, maybe two years, maybe never.
[00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:25.713]  I guarantee that if we have our way, it will be at least until you're not able to do anything to stop it.
[00:53:25.973 --> 00:53:34.657]  Just surrender your personal freedom and common sense to our fear merchants and government and the media, because none of this works unless you all go along with it.
[00:53:35.037 --> 00:53:40.760]  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to do some augmented reality spirit cooking with Marina Abramovich.
[00:53:41.537 --> 00:53:41.877]  I know.
[00:53:43.078 --> 00:53:46.319]  Thanks to you kids, we now know the virus is a hoax.
[00:53:46.479 --> 00:53:50.882]  They included flu, pneumonia, and other infections to boost the numbers.
[00:53:50.902 --> 00:53:52.542]  Let's find out who is really behind it all.
[00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:56.124]  Like, President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[00:53:59.346 --> 00:54:00.346]  Gigi Pink?
[00:54:01.907 --> 00:54:02.967]  Dr. Fauci?
[00:54:03.027 --> 00:54:06.429]  Like, I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not scare them.
[00:54:07.924 --> 00:54:09.645]  Microsoft's Bill Gates?
[00:54:09.785 --> 00:54:15.869]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's population.
[00:54:16.249 --> 00:54:16.790]  I get it.
[00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:22.253]  So Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak.
[00:54:22.293 --> 00:54:23.374]  That's diabolical.
[00:54:23.394 --> 00:54:25.195]  Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.
[00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:26.296]  Don't worry, kids.
[00:54:26.636 --> 00:54:29.918]  These globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time.
[00:54:30.078 --> 00:54:34.321]  Where they're going, they'll be locked up for a long good while in the big house.
[00:54:34.801 --> 00:54:35.221]  Yeah!
[00:54:35.441 --> 00:54:38.463]  Better than a rock round at home!
[00:54:39.764 --> 00:54:42.246]  But not if big tech has its way!
[00:54:48.189 --> 00:54:52.192]  All right, we did it for an hour yesterday, and it was incredible.
[00:54:52.312 --> 00:54:55.354]  It was incredibly nightmarish, but they don't want you to be heard.
[00:54:55.434 --> 00:54:57.635]  They don't want you to tell your story of what happened.
[00:54:57.655 --> 00:55:00.157]  You took the vaccine or what happened to your father, your mother, your neighbor.
[00:55:01.017 --> 00:55:03.339]  They've tried to silence, you know, the families of
[00:55:04.502 --> 00:55:06.885]  Famous sports stars that have died after taking the vaccine.
[00:55:07.746 --> 00:55:11.491]  And here we are on over 200 radio stations, over 100 TV and cable stations.
[00:55:12.772 --> 00:55:14.134]  And of course at BandDot Video.
[00:55:15.302 --> 00:55:17.464]  With audio and video streams at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:17.524 --> 00:55:18.985]  And our audience is so precious.
[00:55:19.025 --> 00:55:20.126]  It's a giant audience.
[00:55:20.547 --> 00:55:23.790]  But the system does everything it can to keep us from reaching new people.
[00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:26.612]  That's why everything is about you.
[00:55:27.493 --> 00:55:30.976]  Sending out the live links to the show from InfoWars.com.
[00:55:30.996 --> 00:55:31.997]  Put the live feed up, please.
[00:55:32.017 --> 00:55:33.659]  I want to show people the name of today's show.
[00:55:33.679 --> 00:55:34.580]  We give each show a title.
[00:55:35.905 --> 00:55:44.371]  Getting the articles, getting the videos, on your text message, on your email, on your word of mouth, getting those out to people so they understand the truth.
[00:55:44.651 --> 00:55:46.833]  People are very, very hungry right now.
[00:55:48.854 --> 00:55:49.575]  There's the headline.
[00:55:49.835 --> 00:55:51.216]  Must watch Friday live.
[00:55:51.256 --> 00:55:52.617]  The Mark of the Beast is here.
[00:55:52.737 --> 00:55:59.102]  Walmart joins Communist China-EU with medical social credit score.
[00:56:00.117 --> 00:56:03.519]  And here it is out of the New York Times, Walmart becomes largest U.S.
[00:56:03.539 --> 00:56:08.021]  vaccine provider to join push for digital vaccine credentials.
[00:56:08.061 --> 00:56:11.402]  They say you may even need it in the future to go in their store.
[00:56:12.103 --> 00:56:14.404]  Oh, remember they had the UN call for it all.
[00:56:14.424 --> 00:56:15.624]  People go, oh, that'll never happen.
[00:56:16.064 --> 00:56:18.426]  I said, you watch, I'll just keep calling for it till you get used to it.
[00:56:19.006 --> 00:56:22.728]  Now in the UK, they promised they wouldn't do it.
[00:56:22.748 --> 00:56:23.848]  It was a conspiracy theory.
[00:56:24.268 --> 00:56:25.409]  The internal documents came out.
[00:56:25.449 --> 00:56:27.330]  They were planning a year ago to roll this out.
[00:56:28.424 --> 00:56:30.186]  That was in Operation Lockstep ten years ago.
[00:56:31.407 --> 00:56:32.868]  Crimson Contagion two years ago.
[00:56:33.369 --> 00:56:37.053]  It's all planned out and everything they plan out they pull until we say no.
[00:56:37.793 --> 00:56:39.715]  So they're just hitting us with everything they've got right now.
[00:56:40.476 --> 00:56:49.165]  No government will authorize mRNA gene therapy because in the human studies it caused so much cancer and death and boy-in-the-bubble syndrome.
[00:56:49.185 --> 00:56:49.585]  Look it up.
[00:56:50.025 --> 00:56:51.327]  Showed you Mainline News yesterday.
[00:56:53.342 --> 00:57:05.546]  And so now they're just bum-rushing us on every single front, and they're admitting that the vaccines are actually causing new virus strains that are actually deadlier than what was happening before.
[00:57:06.266 --> 00:57:08.927]  Which, again, is part of the plan.
[00:57:09.047 --> 00:57:14.768]  It's in the Rockefeller Foundation documents that I'm going to hit at the start of the next hour, but I want to give the number out.
[00:57:14.868 --> 00:57:19.950]  I want to take your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen, specifically
[00:57:22.487 --> 00:57:31.555]  on one subject in this first hour, because we have a phone system that takes 20 calls, and I probably only get like 10 calls an hour.
[00:57:32.176 --> 00:57:41.824]  But when I go through that board of calls, then I'm going to open the phones up again, because I'm going to be hosting the fourth hour, so we've got a lot of time today.
[00:57:42.564 --> 00:57:48.690]  So let's say at the bottom of the next hour, we will shift out of that all-important topic to another big one, end-of-the-world stuff,
[00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:56.948]  Biden's people being absolutely shut down by the Communist Chinese at the first big summit in Alaska yesterday.
[00:57:57.188 --> 00:57:58.569]  Total disrespect for Biden.
[00:57:59.109 --> 00:58:02.410]  Total disrespect for America by North Korea because they know he's a puppet.
[00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:07.791]  And on their payroll, and Biden said, I'm gonna let Xi Jinping do whatever he wants.
[00:58:08.392 --> 00:58:09.452]  He can run Hong Kong.
[00:58:09.492 --> 00:58:10.572]  He can run Taiwan.
[00:58:10.632 --> 00:58:11.933]  He can kill the Uyghurs if he wants.
[00:58:11.953 --> 00:58:12.833]  Remember what he said on CNN?
[00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:16.272]  That's the real policy.
[00:58:16.812 --> 00:58:18.433]  And so China doesn't see that as strength.
[00:58:18.453 --> 00:58:19.314]  They see that as weakness.
[00:58:19.614 --> 00:58:22.837]  So they rub our nose in it on international TV.
[00:58:23.237 --> 00:58:24.718]  And Putin didn't start it.
[00:58:25.098 --> 00:58:27.921]  Biden said, oh, you know, I'll take him out of the shed and kick his ass like he said about Trump.
[00:58:29.141 --> 00:58:33.445]  He's like, well, you know, he's a killer.
[00:58:33.485 --> 00:58:34.605]  He's a piece of garbage.
[00:58:34.625 --> 00:58:35.386]  He's about to get it.
[00:58:35.946 --> 00:58:36.887]  We're about to show him.
[00:58:36.907 --> 00:58:44.273]  And this is all coming out of these globalist idiots who absolutely are totally bought off and sold out a bunch of dirtbag lawyers.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:54.789]  It's the Alex Jones Show, starring Alex Jones and Owen Schroyer, Harrison Smith, and the rest of the great crew.
[00:58:58.553 --> 00:59:00.655]  But I tell you, we're not in Mayberry anymore, are we?
[00:59:02.076 --> 00:59:02.697]  No, we're not.
[00:59:04.138 --> 00:59:07.942]  Imagine if you could get in a time machine and go back.
[00:59:09.804 --> 00:59:11.746]  Into the past.
[00:59:11.766 --> 00:59:12.507]  Would you go there?
[00:59:12.567 --> 00:59:13.689]  You know, I don't think I would.
[00:59:13.709 --> 00:59:16.692]  Because back then we had our own problems and we had our own evils.
[00:59:16.732 --> 00:59:27.564]  But today we're really facing the ultimate threat here with civilization, here with society, really, really in a big, big, big way.
[00:59:27.584 --> 00:59:29.386]  Hey guys, my earpiece came unclipped.
[00:59:29.407 --> 00:59:30.187]  It's driving me crazy.
[00:59:31.357 --> 00:59:33.838]  So will somebody come, or I don't know, maybe this is a new earpiece.
[00:59:34.298 --> 00:59:36.219]  It's just so long and it's super annoying.
[00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:39.961]  I've never, I've never seen a talk show host that's got like a two foot long earpiece.
[00:59:40.822 --> 00:59:42.462]  I know you guys love this earpiece and everything.
[00:59:42.482 --> 00:59:46.224]  You told me this is the earpiece I ought to use, but it's just driving me absolutely insane.
[00:59:47.465 --> 00:59:52.948]  But let's go ahead and roll that video of the Commander-in-Chief Biden with some audio, please.
[00:59:55.749 --> 00:59:56.009]  Thanks.
[00:59:56.489 --> 00:59:56.970]  There you go.
[00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:59.391]  And he's just kind of stumbling along there.
[01:00:00.336 --> 01:00:04.158]  Towards the aircraft and he looks like he's having trouble walking right there.
[01:00:04.798 --> 01:00:10.161]  He's got his little virtue signaling face diaper on and doesn't seem to know what planet he's on.
[01:00:11.882 --> 01:00:16.244]  And then as he goes up, he falls down twice and he is losing weight extremely fast.
[01:00:16.765 --> 01:00:22.668]  No amount of amphetamines, no amount of blood transfusions are going to put the Crypt Keeper back together again.
[01:00:24.411 --> 01:00:29.052]  They all salute the guy that couldn't even get a crowd of 100 people at his events, who stole the election from Trump.
[01:00:29.772 --> 01:00:34.253]  He's got military surrounding, everything, and he falls down three times.
[01:00:35.714 --> 01:00:36.394]  Three times.
[01:00:36.474 --> 01:00:44.556]  Can't even get back up, and then does his little ginger, I'm a cool lawyer thing, and then turns around and salutes everyone.
[01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:52.518]  So, you know what Joe Biden really is, is he is the gravestone, the gravestone,
[01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:56.150]  That marks the end of America.
[01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:58.171]  That's really what he is.
[01:00:58.771 --> 01:00:59.892]  America born July 4, 1776.
[01:01:02.473 --> 01:01:03.293]  Died January 20, 2021.
[01:01:05.174 --> 01:01:08.116]  And I don't say that with any relish.
[01:01:08.676 --> 01:01:09.637]  I don't say that with enjoyment.
[01:01:10.117 --> 01:01:12.198]  We have to admit the country is gone.
[01:01:12.218 --> 01:01:14.619]  And I'm going to cover that more after I take your calls.
[01:01:14.659 --> 01:01:20.562]  But China, again, just humiliated us in Alaska in a face-to-face with the administration.
[01:01:24.608 --> 01:01:44.032]  Putin just humiliated us because you've got this empty suit that can't even talk that's shooting his mouth off and saying we're about to punish Russia with serious war-like rhetoric and the average leftist is oblivious because they believe they can suspend the rules of the universe.
[01:01:44.072 --> 01:01:50.933]  They believe they can suspend common sense and justice and all of this and just
[01:01:51.977 --> 01:01:56.281]  This is what happens with these corporate heads that have been having everybody do what they say for decades.
[01:01:57.142 --> 01:01:59.764]  Remember the Deepwater Horizon.
[01:01:59.784 --> 01:02:01.526]  And this is one of the most important things I've ever said.
[01:02:03.528 --> 01:02:05.270]  Remember the Deepwater Horizon.
[01:02:06.691 --> 01:02:08.112]  And Kurt Russell did a great job.
[01:02:10.755 --> 01:02:13.878]  The point is, is that they made a movie out of it.
[01:02:15.862 --> 01:02:20.507]  And it's based off the court filings and the court hearings.
[01:02:20.587 --> 01:02:22.949]  And so I knew that when I saw the movie.
[01:02:25.271 --> 01:02:29.135]  I later learned that on the DVD they actually had hours of the actual court testimony.
[01:02:30.316 --> 01:02:34.140]  And I actually watched the court testimony that I guess came out years after they had the trial.
[01:02:35.261 --> 01:02:37.143]  And they knew
[01:02:39.226 --> 01:02:46.850]  The engineers knew that when they stopped dumping concrete into the super deep gas well, that it would cause a blowout and a huge explosion.
[01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:54.455]  But the executives in London told the executives in DC, you're spending $25 million a day putting concrete in there.
[01:02:54.835 --> 01:02:57.136]  They had dozens of ships a day delivering the concrete.
[01:02:57.576 --> 01:02:59.758]  They said, we're a huge rich company.
[01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:01.338]  We just say, don't put concrete in.
[01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:05.801]  And the mathematicians, the engineers said, it will blow up.
[01:03:08.837 --> 01:03:10.658]  And they said, we say you're wrong.
[01:03:13.059 --> 01:03:16.461]  And they follow the order.
[01:03:18.722 --> 01:03:20.883]  And they stopped dumping the concrete in.
[01:03:22.404 --> 01:03:25.506]  And then another high level manager got there, but he still wasn't an executive.
[01:03:25.586 --> 01:03:26.786]  Another engineer said, I don't care.
[01:03:27.087 --> 01:03:27.967]  My job's on the line.
[01:03:28.227 --> 01:03:29.028]  We're not doing this.
[01:03:30.428 --> 01:03:31.009]  Stopped it.
[01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:32.389]  Stopped the drilling.
[01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:34.090]  So they were going to put more concrete in.
[01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:34.731]  They said, well, you know what?
[01:03:35.051 --> 01:03:37.132]  We're just going to do the pressure test now.
[01:03:38.962 --> 01:03:40.722]  Ordered the pressure test, and it blew up.
[01:03:40.782 --> 01:03:41.483]  You know what happened.
[01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:42.743]  And it's the same thing.
[01:03:42.863 --> 01:03:44.363]  Gates just did this.
[01:03:45.524 --> 01:03:51.025]  They couldn't get any government to approve the mRNA gene editing, which of course is a big deal.
[01:03:51.085 --> 01:03:59.767]  I mean, if they can really figure out how to go in and edit your genes and end cancer and do all this, it'll be the biggest thing since ever.
[01:04:00.227 --> 01:04:01.948]  It'll be bigger than fire, bigger than the wheel.
[01:04:02.188 --> 01:04:02.928]  This is playing God.
[01:04:05.111 --> 01:04:08.873]  This is lightning in a bottle, but they want to test it all on us.
[01:04:09.433 --> 01:04:10.754]  And it's extremely dangerous.
[01:04:11.254 --> 01:04:14.076]  And so they're now testing on billions of people.
[01:04:14.096 --> 01:04:15.517]  16% of the U.S.
[01:04:15.557 --> 01:04:17.818]  population is vaccinated.
[01:04:17.858 --> 01:04:27.003]  I was reading the other day, they think over a billion people now worldwide have been vaccinated with a system that manipulates your DNA and all the scientists admit is super dangerous.
[01:04:27.043 --> 01:04:30.925]  And you spin the wheel, the weird stuff it can do, and it's already causing mass death.
[01:04:32.383 --> 01:04:33.444]  And it's the same thing.
[01:04:33.964 --> 01:04:38.727]  It's one thing to watch a movie where they actually use testimony and transcripts of what was said.
[01:04:38.947 --> 01:04:48.673]  But when I watched on the DVD hours of the actual hearings where they had the executives admitting, we don't know.
[01:04:48.753 --> 01:04:50.354]  We just thought the engineers were wrong.
[01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:54.076]  So we just said, we'll save $27 million a day and not put concrete in the hole.
[01:04:56.898 --> 01:04:58.479]  And they're asking him, did you know it would blow up?
[01:04:58.519 --> 01:04:59.860]  They're like, no, we just thought it wouldn't.
[01:05:03.803 --> 01:05:04.683]  It's like Chernobyl.
[01:05:05.644 --> 01:05:08.344]  It later came out that the Communist Party showed up.
[01:05:08.384 --> 01:05:10.185]  They said, you're not running this thing at full capacity.
[01:05:10.525 --> 01:05:12.026]  We're having power outages in the area.
[01:05:12.366 --> 01:05:14.166]  They said, look, this reactor's got major problems.
[01:05:14.186 --> 01:05:16.047]  It needs to be fixed.
[01:05:16.107 --> 01:05:19.588]  And you cannot run these power tests at full power.
[01:05:19.828 --> 01:05:21.969]  There's a chance that it'll bring the reactor offline.
[01:05:23.148 --> 01:05:25.130]  Well, it didn't do that, it blew the damn thing up.
[01:05:25.951 --> 01:05:27.072]  So, let me explain again.
[01:05:27.152 --> 01:05:35.640]  You get people that aren't engineers telling the engineers to do something they tell them is dangerous, and it didn't just take it offline, it blew up when they did it.
[01:05:37.062 --> 01:05:37.983]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:05:38.023 --> 01:05:45.991]  The engineers told them, this is going to blow up, and the bankers went, we're bankers, we're God, just do it.
[01:05:47.697 --> 01:05:49.598]  And so that's what I'm telling you, that's why I'm so concerned.
[01:05:49.998 --> 01:06:02.362]  Bill Gates and these guys have done something a billion times worse than the Deepwater Horizon and the BP's oil explosion, oil and gas explosion.
[01:06:03.142 --> 01:06:11.264]  They have jumped the shark at a level never before even imagined, and the death is insane.
[01:06:11.504 --> 01:06:13.345]  I know people that are dead from the shot.
[01:06:13.925 --> 01:06:16.566]  This office, everyone here knows people that got deathly ill or died.
[01:06:17.938 --> 01:06:21.401]  I'm going to open the phones up, the next segment, and you'll hear other people call in.
[01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:27.665]  And we're just sitting here watching this while these crazy people do this.
[01:06:28.886 --> 01:06:33.230]  It's like the FBI director going, there's no antifa at the Capitol, even though they arrested a bunch of them.
[01:06:35.211 --> 01:06:44.038]  Or it's like Pelosi came out again and the Democrats came out again and a bunch of them came out again and said there is no such thing as antifa.
[01:06:48.049 --> 01:06:49.209]  I mean they're just constant.
[01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.710]  Who was it?
[01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:50.810]  So many of them.
[01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:53.291]  Who was the Democrat yesterday said there's no such thing as Antifa?
[01:06:54.152 --> 01:06:55.052]  I forget who it was now.
[01:06:56.072 --> 01:06:56.833]  It wasn't Nadler.
[01:06:56.853 --> 01:06:57.673]  He said that last year.
[01:06:58.313 --> 01:07:05.256]  But after everything we've seen and cities burning with Antifa leading it, another major Democrat came out and said it's a myth.
[01:07:07.017 --> 01:07:08.778]  I wanted to play the clip yesterday and we never got to it.
[01:07:08.798 --> 01:07:09.358]  Who was it?
[01:07:11.721 --> 01:07:14.162]  Yeah, it was, okay, it was Joy Behar, that's right.
[01:07:14.902 --> 01:07:15.702]  I mean, wow!
[01:07:16.602 --> 01:07:17.422]  This is just crazy.
[01:07:17.442 --> 01:07:18.843]  We'll be right back, I'll give the number, I'll stay with us.
[01:07:19.123 --> 01:07:26.505]  The globalists didn't tell us for the last hundred years they were going to establish world government to carry out the orderly depopulation of the planet for no reason.
[01:07:27.765 --> 01:07:34.587]  They didn't prepare all these systems to produce thousands of movies promoting it, or thousands of books, because they were playing tiddlywinks.
[01:07:35.779 --> 01:07:40.281]  They mean business, and they mean to take full control of human civilization.
[01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:42.983]  They're not in full control yet, but they're getting damn close.
[01:07:43.003 --> 01:07:45.784]  A lot of people say, well, I'll just submit and go along with them.
[01:07:45.824 --> 01:07:46.065]  Really?
[01:07:46.085 --> 01:07:50.487]  It's like the James Bond movie where they got him strapped down about to kill him with a laser.
[01:07:52.408 --> 01:07:53.729]  And he says, you expect me to talk?
[01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:58.531]  And he says, no, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[01:08:01.993 --> 01:08:04.815]  And so everybody can play along like you're part of the system.
[01:08:04.875 --> 01:08:05.195]  You're not.
[01:08:07.498 --> 01:08:16.225]  I just love how I told people about world government decades ago and how it was all being set up for medical tyranny to use a virus for a lockdown to build a post-human society.
[01:08:16.265 --> 01:08:19.568]  And I had the documents then and people didn't want to believe me.
[01:08:19.988 --> 01:08:28.335]  And now they don't even give me credit for having the documents.
[01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:31.398]  They think I'm like a prophet.
[01:08:33.388 --> 01:08:37.311]  I have sat there with senators and former heads of U.S.
[01:08:37.351 --> 01:08:45.456]  intelligence agencies and billionaires and you name it, and they literally go, how did you know all this?
[01:08:46.197 --> 01:08:47.337]  How did you predict it?
[01:08:47.638 --> 01:08:49.639]  How did you know they do lockdowns and use a virus?
[01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:50.960]  And they're just like, wow.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.481]  And I'm like, it's in the damn documents.
[01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:58.475]  Now, granted, there's a lot of documents, but there's key documents, and there's all the rest of the BS.
[01:08:59.056 --> 01:09:07.863]  Like, I'm getting a lot of calls and a lot of texts, and I'm seeing people say, Jones, why haven't you talked about this incel that went and shot the eight people in Atlanta?
[01:09:08.624 --> 01:09:14.269]  Well, I mean, day one when I saw it was Jack Shacks, massage parlors, sex shops.
[01:09:17.332 --> 01:09:20.855]  I was like, it's probably some gang war, or it's some incel.
[01:09:23.212 --> 01:09:26.655]  And once I saw the suspect, I go, my God, he looks like all the mass shooters.
[01:09:27.015 --> 01:09:27.676]  He's an incel.
[01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:28.296]  He hates women.
[01:09:29.177 --> 01:09:33.460]  Now, he's an incel that at least went and got, you know, serviced or whatever.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:37.263]  And I'm not for the sex trade, but I'm just saying he at least went out and was doing something.
[01:09:37.503 --> 01:09:39.865]  But then he got mad that he was spending all his money on this.
[01:09:43.608 --> 01:09:44.909]  And so then he went and killed the women.
[01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:46.310]  That's not because they were Asian.
[01:09:47.391 --> 01:09:50.854]  You know, that's like Jack the Ripper was reportedly the crown prince.
[01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:55.823]  And he was mad at the hookers, so he wouldn't kill a bunch of them.
[01:09:56.143 --> 01:09:57.845]  That was a white dude killing white women.
[01:09:58.666 --> 01:10:05.835]  You know, uh, John's killing hookers is as old as the world, and it's wrong, and it's disgusting, and it's cowardly.
[01:10:10.609 --> 01:10:11.390]  But that's what happened.
[01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:16.313]  Instead, it's like, oh, there's a war on Asians.
[01:10:16.753 --> 01:10:23.278]  Well, look, I don't want to get into racial statistics because I love everybody, but let's talk about who's attacking the Asians.
[01:10:24.098 --> 01:10:30.983]  Because the Asians come in and build businesses and things in poor black areas and resentment builds up, a lot of it unfounded, some of it founded.
[01:10:32.799 --> 01:10:36.063]  Only because I have grew up in Dallas and I love Asian folks too.
[01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:41.388]  I'm just saying some of the Asians in the places are rude and the fights get started and a lot of enmity begins.
[01:10:41.448 --> 01:10:45.893]  The people's robbing the shops and then everybody is treated bad and then it turns into a fight.
[01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:47.275]  I mean, my goodness.
[01:10:47.335 --> 01:10:49.517]  I mean, the black folks are killing each other in those neighborhoods.
[01:10:49.817 --> 01:10:52.380]  So the fact they start killing the Asians, I mean, that's just what's going on.
[01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:54.663]  And it's a problem.
[01:10:56.135 --> 01:11:01.760]  But the media trying to turn this around and say there's an epidemic of white supremacists killing Asians?
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:10.768]  There was a video on CNN this morning of a homeless guy that tried to reportedly rob an Asian lady, and so she hit him, he hit them, and it was like, top story!
[01:11:11.089 --> 01:11:12.890]  White supremacist attacks old woman!
[01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:14.792]  It turns out he's a homeless mental patient.
[01:11:16.654 --> 01:11:21.318]  You know, a white homeless person in Seattle bit my cousin.
[01:11:26.018 --> 01:11:31.560]  Who I was such good friends with, Jeffrey, I won't say his last name.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:48.705]  And he went to give one homeless guy a 20, and the other homeless guy was so mad, bit his hand, he almost had to have his arm removed, and the infection ate his liver, and he died six months later from the homeless person that bit him.
[01:11:50.043 --> 01:11:51.524]  It was a white dude, bit of white dude.
[01:11:51.564 --> 01:12:00.089]  So yes, a literal, rabid, homeless person in Seattle killed my cousin, who worked for Microsoft.
[01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:04.072]  I was making a million dollars a year, but he's dead now.
[01:12:04.632 --> 01:12:07.594]  So that's how all of this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:08.837 --> 01:12:09.117]  And that's
[01:12:26.627 --> 01:12:32.650]  A black on Asian crime, and so the media has to cover that up, so they turn it into white on Asian crime.
[01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:41.093]  And out of 350 million people, an incel didn't go up and shoot up the high school because the girls didn't want him, didn't go shoot up the college because the girls didn't want him.
[01:12:42.574 --> 01:12:46.335]  He went and shot up the women that were sex workers.
[01:12:47.056 --> 01:12:49.317]  And of course, the media doesn't make an issue about sex workers.
[01:12:50.185 --> 01:12:51.365]  But let me give you a little newsflash.
[01:12:52.025 --> 01:12:53.646]  I've never done it, but I know a lot of people that have.
[01:12:53.946 --> 01:12:56.146]  You know, you saw the owner of the Patriots got in trouble for it.
[01:12:56.486 --> 01:12:58.627]  Do you know what those massage parlors are?
[01:13:00.047 --> 01:13:03.267]  Do you know what the lingerie modeling places are?
[01:13:04.448 --> 01:13:05.528]  Those are whorehouses.
[01:13:07.268 --> 01:13:07.468]  Yeah.
[01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:11.169]  And you go in there and you pay them $100, they do this.
[01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:12.609]  You pay them $300, they do that.
[01:13:13.069 --> 01:13:14.810]  That's what goes on at those places.
[01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:16.170]  Okay?
[01:13:18.106 --> 01:13:21.989]  I know a lot of famous people that are totally addicted to it and, like, do it three times a day.
[01:13:22.929 --> 01:13:29.473]  Like, I know a very famous person who's really cool, but I can't hang out with him because that's all he wants to do is go to Jack Shack's.
[01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:34.377]  And I'm not going to sit there eating a hamburger in the car while he's in a Jack Shack for 20 minutes.
[01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.778]  So that's what they are, folks.
[01:13:37.058 --> 01:13:38.640]  They're called Jack Shacks.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.102]  And you pull up the incel that killed these women.
[01:13:42.482 --> 01:13:44.003]  I hope they execute his little ass.
[01:13:44.563 --> 01:13:46.565]  I hope they haul him up with piano wire.
[01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.823]  You're the little pervert, look at him.
[01:13:51.645 --> 01:14:00.453]  You're the little pervert in your body armor and all the rest of it, it's a little commando that's mad at the women that you pay to service you.
[01:14:00.493 --> 01:14:02.455]  You're a pathetic maggot.
[01:14:04.196 --> 01:14:06.619]  But I will not turn in my guns because you did this.
[01:14:08.761 --> 01:14:09.481]  And the answer is,
[01:14:10.749 --> 01:14:15.111]  Ladies, if you're running a whorehouse, you need to have a gunman there.
[01:14:15.411 --> 01:14:16.991]  But that's another thing about the Jack Shacks.
[01:14:17.432 --> 01:14:18.152]  They don't have pimps.
[01:14:18.192 --> 01:14:18.932]  They're run by women.
[01:14:21.453 --> 01:14:24.794]  And again, I'm not an officiato, but I study everything.
[01:14:24.814 --> 01:14:26.715]  I am an officiato of crime.
[01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:28.016]  It's what I look into.
[01:14:28.116 --> 01:14:30.256]  And I've asked people to go to these things.
[01:14:30.276 --> 01:14:30.717]  They're all over.
[01:14:30.737 --> 01:14:32.477]  You can't swing a stick in Austin and not hit one.
[01:14:33.217 --> 01:14:34.558]  The cars are all in the parking lot.
[01:14:34.598 --> 01:14:35.918]  I'm like, are there pimps there?
[01:14:36.419 --> 01:14:37.279]  No, there's no pimps.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:39.600]  It's run by the women.
[01:14:40.555 --> 01:14:42.156]  There's usually a cop car down the street.
[01:14:42.376 --> 01:14:44.057]  Well, let me tell you who runs the Jack Shacks.
[01:14:44.857 --> 01:14:48.019]  I mean, they busted a bunch of Austin captains years ago running them.
[01:14:48.219 --> 01:14:49.740]  They were running like seven or eight of them here in town.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.541]  The police run the Jack Shacks.
[01:14:51.561 --> 01:14:53.182]  I mean, they get a little cut.
[01:14:53.262 --> 01:14:55.623]  I guess they get a little taste of the Jack Shack.
[01:14:56.024 --> 01:15:00.946]  But anyways, you've now gotten a little lore here on air about Jack Shacks, and I'm going to stop at that point.
[01:15:03.148 --> 01:15:04.529]  Let's get into serious issues now.
[01:15:04.949 --> 01:15:06.970]  Not Biden falling on his face, not any of that.
[01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:08.451]  I want to take an hour of your calls.
[01:15:09.619 --> 01:15:13.442]  For first-time callers, your story about the vaccine.
[01:15:13.462 --> 01:15:14.022]  Did you take it?
[01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:14.623]  Did you love it?
[01:15:15.323 --> 01:15:16.524]  What happened to your loved ones?
[01:15:16.584 --> 01:15:17.305]  Was it wonderful?
[01:15:17.345 --> 01:15:17.985]  Was it terrible?
[01:15:18.766 --> 01:15:19.887]  Did your loved ones get sick?
[01:15:19.907 --> 01:15:23.049]  Did your loved ones sprout wings like a butterfly and fly around the room?
[01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:26.952]  All we got was negative hell yesterday, and every other show does just the same thing.
[01:15:27.472 --> 01:15:32.476]  And this is what Big Tech doesn't want anyone else to know.
[01:15:35.506 --> 01:15:41.971]  They are fighting around the clock to suppress this, but the evidence is all coming out and they can't hide it, and they've got liability protection.
[01:15:41.991 --> 01:15:52.020]  But they don't have liability protection from racketeering and their attempts to suppress people doing consumer reviews, or talking about what's happened to them, or talking about what has unfolded.
[01:15:53.941 --> 01:15:55.182]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:15:59.774 --> 01:16:02.416]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:16:02.436 --> 01:16:02.676]  877-789-2539.
[01:16:03.176 --> 01:16:07.179]  I know it's hard to talk about your family member that went into convulsions.
[01:16:07.579 --> 01:16:09.541]  It's hard to talk about what happened to you when you took it.
[01:16:09.861 --> 01:16:12.202]  It's hard to talk about your father that died, or your mother.
[01:16:12.242 --> 01:16:14.544]  But we got the calls, and they were bone-chilling.
[01:16:15.264 --> 01:16:19.327]  And those videos are on Bandot Video, and they're going viral.
[01:16:19.707 --> 01:16:23.270]  Three or four videos from yesterday already have 200,000 to 400,000 views.
[01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.112]  And people are waking up.
[01:16:26.432 --> 01:16:28.013]  So, we gotta save people.
[01:16:29.582 --> 01:16:30.623]  We gotta save people.
[01:16:31.243 --> 01:16:32.144]  We gotta warn people.
[01:16:32.164 --> 01:16:37.449]  We have a responsibility to do this, especially because they're gonna push and push and push and make it mandatory by next year.
[01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:38.009]  That's the goal.
[01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:46.537]  Once they get the sheeple inoculated, they're gonna go, oh, people are still sick, not because the vaccine's causing illnesses, not because the vaccine's caused mutations, but...
[01:16:48.735 --> 01:16:50.436]  Because you haven't taken your inoculation.
[01:16:50.676 --> 01:16:52.396]  So we've got to fight this now.
[01:16:52.416 --> 01:16:55.098]  We've got to fight it now before the next phases go into place.
[01:16:55.498 --> 01:16:58.079]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:16:58.259 --> 01:16:59.139]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.600]  Thank you for caring, folks.
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.841]  Thank you for being in the game.
[01:17:03.621 --> 01:17:05.282]  Thank you for not being a spectator.
[01:17:05.322 --> 01:17:06.222]  Thank you for tuning in.
[01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.303]  Because we're not going to mince words.
[01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:09.523]  We're not going to pull punches here.
[01:17:10.104 --> 01:17:13.485]  I'm almost, not almost, I'm frightened to take these calls.
[01:17:14.245 --> 01:17:18.187]  When we had, what, three people call in whose family members died after they took the shots?
[01:17:20.365 --> 01:17:21.406]  I'd love to hear a bunch of calls.
[01:17:21.446 --> 01:17:22.166]  Everything went well.
[01:17:23.727 --> 01:17:24.228]  Didn't happen.
[01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:26.989]  And I'm looking at the news here, man.
[01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:28.250]  I mean, there are so many deaths now.
[01:17:28.831 --> 01:17:31.472]  They admit thousands of deaths from the vaccine in the U.S.
[01:17:31.552 --> 01:17:33.373]  They're like, well, that's a good price to pay.
[01:17:35.055 --> 01:17:43.280]  And the EU government goes, well, we've had a lot of deaths and a lot of problems, but it's overall, the risks are outweighed by the benefit.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.743]  But then separately, if you criticize the death, big tech goes, there are no deaths!
[01:17:49.178 --> 01:17:50.940]  You're banned off Twitter and Facebook!
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:55.343]  And that makes me really angry at Big Tech.
[01:17:55.383 --> 01:18:07.013]  Really angry at Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai.
[01:18:10.016 --> 01:18:11.997]  What's really weird is, I'm not gonna even go there.
[01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:16.061]  Let's just say this, these guys aren't in charge.
[01:18:17.356 --> 01:18:23.541]  And Jack Dorsey and others have directly told a very, very famous person I know, oh, we love Alex.
[01:18:23.981 --> 01:18:24.862]  He's good.
[01:18:25.142 --> 01:18:26.403]  Let him know we're really on his side.
[01:18:29.506 --> 01:18:32.868]  You know, the first time I got that message from Mark Zuckerberg, I didn't believe it.
[01:18:34.429 --> 01:18:35.670]  I'm like, Mark's going to show you.
[01:18:36.331 --> 01:18:41.535]  Go ahead and do your first Facebook mentions and see what happens.
[01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:43.016]  And it got like 20 million views.
[01:18:44.177 --> 01:18:45.178]  They did that, folks.
[01:18:46.547 --> 01:18:49.548]  And then like a month later, well, you're not being very nice to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:18:50.528 --> 01:18:53.429]  And imagine everybody else just takes it, because that's money.
[01:18:54.349 --> 01:18:55.589]  That's like counterfeit money.
[01:18:57.310 --> 01:19:01.751]  To just give somebody, let people have access to their viewers and let them have 20 million views.
[01:19:02.031 --> 01:19:05.572]  I mean, yeah, people clicked on it, but they rigged that.
[01:19:06.372 --> 01:19:09.093]  But what's crazy is they try to force feed Joe Biden.
[01:19:09.633 --> 01:19:11.614]  He had 1,000 people watch him last night.
[01:19:13.117 --> 01:19:16.520]  So what I'm getting at here is they don't want this information on air.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.762]  They hate you having a chance to call in.
[01:19:19.162 --> 01:19:20.323]  I love you having a chance.
[01:19:20.363 --> 01:19:21.584]  I'm very honored you're calling in.
[01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:26.188]  Jason and Christopher and Jason and Henry and Julie and Jason.
[01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:27.649]  We've got a lot of Jasons today.
[01:19:27.689 --> 01:19:28.330]  And Andrew?
[01:19:32.013 --> 01:19:38.399]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Missouri.
[01:19:38.439 --> 01:19:39.339]  Jason, thanks for calling.
[01:19:39.359 --> 01:19:39.680]  Go ahead.
[01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:43.357]  Hi Alex, long time listener, first time caller, man.
[01:19:43.717 --> 01:19:50.040]  I've got a, my business partner, his father-in-law took the Pfizer vaccine.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:53.421]  He was in good health, mid-70s, Vietnam vet.
[01:19:53.441 --> 01:19:57.923]  Took the Pfizer vaccine within a week.
[01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:03.172]  He was, uh, got to the point where he couldn't hardly walk, couldn't hardly move.
[01:20:03.192 --> 01:20:08.035]  Um, went to the hospital and within about 60 hours, about 60 hours after that, he was, uh, he's dead.
[01:20:12.176 --> 01:20:13.436]  Well, that's exactly what happens.
[01:20:13.456 --> 01:20:17.077]  That happened to my brother-in-law's father, who's a medical doctor.
[01:20:17.137 --> 01:20:23.159]  On the second shot, he became basically paralyzed, could barely get up or move, arms and legs paralyzed for several days.
[01:20:23.679 --> 01:20:24.400]  He came out of it.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:25.400]  That's Guillain-Barré.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.921]  What effect has this had on the people that watched this happen?
[01:20:30.882 --> 01:20:34.226]  They're to the point, they were asleep before I've tried and tried to wake them up.
[01:20:34.786 --> 01:20:36.028]  It's a constant battle in my house.
[01:20:36.068 --> 01:20:41.133]  My wife is a nurse practitioner, so obviously it's a constant battle between us and them.
[01:20:43.035 --> 01:20:43.936]  But they're waking up now.
[01:20:44.216 --> 01:20:45.578]  They're starting to listen to InfoWars.
[01:20:45.618 --> 01:20:48.961]  I've been telling them, you know, you need to look at all this information.
[01:20:48.981 --> 01:20:51.444]  They started following Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[01:20:53.183 --> 01:20:53.764]  We're good to go.
[01:21:16.407 --> 01:21:18.209]  And I went to get my tetanus shot.
[01:21:18.469 --> 01:21:22.932]  After I got the shot, I was looking at the little paper they give you, you know, to show what they've done and all that stuff.
[01:21:23.552 --> 01:21:26.975]  And it said on there, MMR with tetanus.
[01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:28.776]  And I was like, I only got one shot.
[01:21:28.816 --> 01:21:29.797]  You've got MMR down here.
[01:21:29.817 --> 01:21:31.338]  She said, no, we piggyback them.
[01:21:31.598 --> 01:21:32.699]  We're starting to mix the shot.
[01:21:32.739 --> 01:21:33.259]  We piggyback.
[01:21:33.299 --> 01:21:36.742]  Oh yeah, that's the one that causes the autism that you never want to mix them.
[01:21:37.955 --> 01:21:38.196]  Right.
[01:21:38.476 --> 01:21:41.982]  And I went, they escorted me out because I went absolutely insane.
[01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:43.525]  I said, I never did consent to this.
[01:21:44.106 --> 01:21:44.687]  This is wrong.
[01:21:44.707 --> 01:21:45.328]  This is illegal.
[01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:47.852]  You cannot give me an injection without me consenting to it.
[01:21:48.333 --> 01:21:51.759]  But that could be a new avenue that they try to approach with the VA.
[01:21:52.685 --> 01:21:56.810]  With people not wanting to get their shots.
[01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:59.092]  That's right, I agree with you.
[01:21:59.132 --> 01:22:10.885]  Listen, Trump's gone now, and I hope he can get control of the Republican Party for America first, and I think he's a good guy overall, but he's doubled down on the vaccines, and basically does what Fauci tells him now, when Fauci was one of his biggest enemies.
[01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.888]  Is that a disappointment for you, Jason?
[01:22:13.959 --> 01:22:14.939]  It's a huge disappointment.
[01:22:15.879 --> 01:22:18.280]  I've had my front of my house hit with bottles.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.080]  I've had all kinds of stuff in my neighborhood.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.361]  My neighborhood has turned... We moved into my neighborhood.
[01:22:23.381 --> 01:22:25.882]  Really nice, middle class, upper middle class neighborhood.
[01:22:26.282 --> 01:22:27.922]  We moved into this place two years ago.
[01:22:27.982 --> 01:22:30.203]  When we moved in, it was very conservative.
[01:22:30.323 --> 01:22:30.803]  All red.
[01:22:30.823 --> 01:22:36.484]  And then all of a sudden, all the license plates that started seeing people moving in was all Chicago.
[01:22:36.504 --> 01:22:39.125]  It was from all of Illinois, New York, Michigan, California.
[01:22:39.165 --> 01:22:40.165]  You know, that's what's crazy.
[01:22:40.225 --> 01:22:42.586]  They flee what they've done and bring it with them.
[01:22:42.606 --> 01:22:43.246]  They're so dumb!
[01:22:44.463 --> 01:22:52.814]  I argue with him about it all the time and it makes me angry that I, you know, like you talk about being persecuted for standing up for Trump.
[01:22:53.174 --> 01:22:54.436]  I was a member of the Proud Boys.
[01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:56.178]  I was at all of the rallies.
[01:22:56.218 --> 01:22:58.782]  I was standing and fighting with Antifa.
[01:22:58.802 --> 01:23:01.285]  I was doing all of this stuff and I was defending Trump.
[01:23:02.193 --> 01:23:06.474]  And then to hear him come out and do this stuff, which, like I said, like you say, I'm not a cult follower.
[01:23:06.534 --> 01:23:08.755]  I don't believe, you know, he's God.
[01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:10.836]  I disagree with a lot of the stuff he did.
[01:23:10.916 --> 01:23:11.716]  A lot of the stuff.
[01:23:11.776 --> 01:23:16.918]  But he was still overall, in the overall picture, he was better for this country than anybody we've ever had in that seat.
[01:23:17.998 --> 01:23:18.418]  I hear you.
[01:23:18.458 --> 01:23:23.200]  Maybe he should come out and fully endorse the vaccine as reverse psychology, and then the Democrats won't take it.
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:24.240]  Thank you so much, Jason.
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.181]  Let's talk to Devin in Texas.
[01:23:26.561 --> 01:23:30.202]  Devin, tell us what you've witnessed with these loving gene therapies.
[01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:34.393]  Oh man, it's terrifying man.
[01:23:34.413 --> 01:23:37.935]  But let me first start off with, I'm a new listener.
[01:23:37.955 --> 01:23:47.698]  I'm so glad that your show's on the air and you know, just having that platform kind of gives me hope for what's actually going on out here.
[01:23:47.718 --> 01:23:56.142]  So I was at work and I get a text message from my grandmother saying that my mom's in the hospital.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:03.581]  And she told me she felt like she was having a heart attack with this vaccine.
[01:24:03.642 --> 01:24:05.722]  I wasn't sure exactly which one she took.
[01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:07.442]  I think it's the Moderna.
[01:24:08.623 --> 01:24:14.464]  But yeah, I just advise people not, do not take this garbage.
[01:24:14.864 --> 01:24:16.085]  Do not take this garbage.
[01:24:16.185 --> 01:24:19.926]  Please, for the love of God, this is not for the people.
[01:24:19.946 --> 01:24:23.866]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:24:23.947 --> 01:24:25.587]  I mean, give us more details of what unfolded.
[01:24:27.052 --> 01:24:36.360]  Um, so I, I don't, all I got was over text was that she was having, um, the really, she got like shaking.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:45.007]  She was shaking and, um, she, she's out of the hospital now, but, um, she, she still feels bad.
[01:24:45.027 --> 01:24:46.609]  She's still feeling the after effects.
[01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:48.250]  And, um.
[01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.212]  Was that the first shot or the second shot?
[01:24:51.007 --> 01:24:52.008]  That was the first one.
[01:25:01.084 --> 01:25:03.086]  That they can't admit they were screwed over.
[01:25:03.386 --> 01:25:16.156]  So if you have a violent reaction to the first shot, I know people that have worked in the State Department, contractors, a lot of people take a lot of shots, and they'll tell them, if you have a bad reaction to a shot, particularly certain types, you can never even take vaccines again, period.
[01:25:16.176 --> 01:25:20.299]  It's like if you've been stung by a bee and have an allergic response, you better carry an EpiPen with you.
[01:25:20.639 --> 01:25:22.180]  Once you have the response, it only gets worse.
[01:25:22.741 --> 01:25:24.842]  The fact that she got sick on the first one,
[01:25:25.623 --> 01:25:26.563]  No, I really hope not.
[01:25:26.583 --> 01:25:32.625]  I've been trying to tell my family this for a month now, and I told them, look, don't get the vaccine, don't take this shot, please don't do it.
[01:25:48.783 --> 01:25:49.984]  I hope so, Alex.
[01:25:50.104 --> 01:25:50.705]  I hope so.
[01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:51.725]  Well, tell them this!
[01:25:51.885 --> 01:25:53.927]  If they're going to go ahead and kill her, take insurance out on her.
[01:25:54.087 --> 01:25:55.188]  And I'm not being sarcastic.
[01:25:55.568 --> 01:25:56.549]  It's a legalized murder.
[01:25:56.609 --> 01:26:01.293]  You should just take out a lot of insurance on your family member, and then just kill their ass with the vaccine.
[01:26:01.313 --> 01:26:01.993]  You'll be protected.
[01:26:02.013 --> 01:26:02.714]  Appreciate you, sir.
[01:26:03.234 --> 01:26:05.075]  And I'm not even being sarcastic.
[01:26:05.135 --> 01:26:05.876]  I am, but I'm not.
[01:26:06.136 --> 01:26:12.601]  I mean, if we're going to just start killing the old people, then all of you ought to go ahead and take out insurance on granddaddy or grandma, because that's who it's killing.
[01:26:12.821 --> 01:26:15.223]  The British government two months ago banned giving it to 75 and up.
[01:26:17.008 --> 01:26:18.449]  All right, I'm gonna go to break.
[01:26:18.469 --> 01:26:19.250]  I'm gonna start the next hour.
[01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:21.931]  I'm going right back to your calls.
[01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:24.833]  877-789-2539 specifically on this.
[01:26:25.193 --> 01:26:29.937]  Briefly, we don't have the store-wide free shipping anymore because the storable food and stuff is just too big a cost.
[01:26:29.957 --> 01:26:30.957]  We can't do it and operate.
[01:26:31.237 --> 01:26:35.921]  But we do have it on select best-selling items, free shipping, super mega blowout sale.
[01:26:37.108 --> 01:26:41.851]  All these items, except for BrainForce Plus, it just came back in, are selling out.
[01:26:41.971 --> 01:26:43.152]  BrainForce Plus we got a lot of.
[01:26:43.232 --> 01:26:46.734]  It's not selling out yet, but it's 50% off and free shipping.
[01:26:46.754 --> 01:26:48.275]  But the BrainForce Plus is there.
[01:26:48.596 --> 01:26:50.977]  Prostagard is selling out, but we're still doing 50% off.
[01:26:51.317 --> 01:26:53.058]  VazoBeat is selling out, 50% off.

[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:59.422]  Dr. Jones Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, amazing, 50% off, free shipping.
[01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:01.343]  The mouthwash, same thing.
[01:27:01.803 --> 01:27:06.625]  Dr. Jones Extra Strength Cabochil Regular Strength, both those 50% off, free shipping.
[01:27:06.825 --> 01:27:12.948]  All Emrix Essentials, the all-natural organic deodorant, shampoo, body wash, a full line of essential oils, deodorant.
[01:27:14.049 --> 01:27:17.090]  Oh, and three different hand sanitizers that are totally natural with essential oils.
[01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:20.312]  They're all 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:27:20.332 --> 01:27:20.732]  We'll be back.
[01:27:22.034 --> 01:27:26.077]  Alright, I'm looking at the comments by the listeners that we're not censoring your calls.
[01:27:26.097 --> 01:27:31.060]  We just ask that you give us your name, you want to tell us where you're calling from, and have a clear phone.
[01:27:31.281 --> 01:27:36.044]  And if you want to call and the vaccine worked great for you, and you loved it, we'd love to hear from you.
[01:27:36.644 --> 01:27:40.167]  But instead, I've got mother-in-law took vaccine, seizures, hospitalized.
[01:27:41.027 --> 01:27:43.769]  Brian, father, doctor, took vaccine, had heart attack.
[01:27:44.110 --> 01:27:44.390]  It just
[01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:54.834]  Oh, don't worry, I can walk around out here and crew members, their children died from vaccines, my grandmother was given polio, I can pull Reuters up, Bill Gates gave people polio everywhere.
[01:27:56.975 --> 01:27:58.356]  But YouTube takes those videos down.
[01:27:59.337 --> 01:28:00.577]  Joe Rogan's such a heavy hitter.
[01:28:01.017 --> 01:28:03.138]  When they threatened to take his stuff down, he went, here's Reuters.
[01:28:03.559 --> 01:28:04.419]  Alex Jones didn't lie.
[01:28:05.119 --> 01:28:08.681]  And here's Bill Gates saying 80% get sick when they take his vaccine.
[01:28:09.382 --> 01:28:12.023]  And they went, because he called their bluff, see?
[01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:16.002]  I am caught in purgatory.
[01:28:16.523 --> 01:28:18.703]  I am isolated here with you, millions of you.
[01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:21.464]  You understand, I'm like frozen in stone.
[01:28:22.044 --> 01:28:25.125]  My brain works, everything's here, but I cannot move without you.
[01:28:26.165 --> 01:28:28.706]  So you call in thanking me, it's preposterous.
[01:28:29.146 --> 01:28:30.246]  I'm in the same boat with you.
[01:28:30.366 --> 01:28:30.967]  I love you.
[01:28:31.027 --> 01:28:31.567]  You love me.
[01:28:33.032 --> 01:28:34.053]  We're literally together!
[01:28:34.573 --> 01:28:36.054]  That's why I'm a tribal person.
[01:28:36.094 --> 01:28:40.397]  You think I like racist black people, or racist white people, or racist whatever, all this stupid crap?
[01:28:40.457 --> 01:28:42.498]  I get that real people don't like me because of what color I am.
[01:28:42.518 --> 01:28:46.301]  A lot of folks like me who are a different color because they've got God, just like I did.
[01:28:47.161 --> 01:28:51.184]  But we don't have time to fight with each other anymore over all this crap!
[01:28:51.244 --> 01:28:55.667]  We're under a globalist New World Order attack that I can tell you ain't human, man!
[01:28:55.687 --> 01:28:58.629]  I don't need to speculate.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.882]  I've looked at it, I'm telling you, it ain't human.
[01:29:02.442 --> 01:29:04.383]  Whatever's running this show wants to get rid of us.
[01:29:04.704 --> 01:29:11.528]  Oh, and the Bible just so told me all this, and said they'll have a world government with the mark of the beast to buy and sell, and all of it comes true, all of it happens.
[01:29:13.069 --> 01:29:15.471]  I'm not, some stations don't carry the first five minutes.
[01:29:16.091 --> 01:29:28.140]  Stations, some of them do, so they, they want me to do it, I do the five minutes, but I don't want to cut Steve, and Brian, and Nick, and Jason, and Granny, do right, and Henry, and Julie, and Jason, and Andrew short.
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:31.263]  So we're gonna go to break in a few minutes, come back.
[01:29:33.226 --> 01:29:37.074]  And should I go to the order they received or the more horrific sounding it is?
[01:29:37.755 --> 01:29:39.158]  It's all so horrible, I don't even know.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.823]  You know, I'm just gonna take it in the order they received.
[01:29:42.938 --> 01:29:44.539]  So I'm going to move quick when we come back.
[01:29:45.139 --> 01:29:46.360]  So dispense with the pleasantries.
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:49.082]  I love you, you love me, like Rush would say, ditto.
[01:29:49.582 --> 01:29:52.104]  And I'm just going to say where you're calling from, make your point next person.
[01:29:52.964 --> 01:29:54.465]  Don't you want to hear the other 100 callers?
[01:29:54.525 --> 01:29:56.847]  Imagine if I actually only had callers like a minute.
[01:29:56.987 --> 01:29:59.188]  We could probably get like 30, 40 callers on an hour.
[01:29:59.909 --> 01:30:02.330]  Imagine everybody lined up trying to get on right now.
[01:30:02.710 --> 01:30:04.752]  Nurses and doctors wanting to tell you what they saw.
[01:30:05.012 --> 01:30:06.633]  Hell, there's new ones every hour.
[01:30:06.693 --> 01:30:08.434]  Prestigious ones everywhere.
[01:30:08.634 --> 01:30:11.356]  Hell, 20 people in our hospital died after they took it.
[01:30:11.936 --> 01:30:18.439]  30 down here, 10 here, 9 there, 8 there, 7 here, 50, I mean, it's a freaking attack, man!
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:21.481]  I'll tell you what's weird about this, though.
[01:30:22.381 --> 01:30:30.725]  Breathing down my neck, stalking me, harassing me, suing me, used to get to me at a level, like I was a little selfish, I was a little mad they were messing with me.
[01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:32.746]  I'm totally free now.
[01:30:33.967 --> 01:30:36.548]  Like, I'm not worried about anything now but beating these people.
[01:30:36.748 --> 01:30:38.269]  And I was always caring about everybody.
[01:30:39.008 --> 01:30:42.230]  But what I'm saying is, freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:44.271]  And honey, we ain't got nothing if you ain't free.
[01:30:45.211 --> 01:30:47.072]  Can we play Janis Joplin coming and we can find out?
[01:30:48.833 --> 01:30:50.474]  Because that's what this is.
[01:30:50.574 --> 01:30:52.695]  I mean, this is so real now.
[01:30:52.895 --> 01:30:54.055]  So real for me.
[01:30:54.216 --> 01:30:55.916]  I mean, I knew they were planning it.
[01:30:56.197 --> 01:30:57.337]  I knew they meant to do it.
[01:30:57.617 --> 01:30:58.718]  I knew they beta tested it.
[01:31:01.001 --> 01:31:11.366]  But now we just can't crack up, we can't kill ourselves, we can't fight with each other, we can't let them get us down, we have to love God, know it's God's plan, go through it together, and know in the end these guys are gonna pay.
[01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:12.426]  But that's not why we do it.
[01:31:12.886 --> 01:31:20.430]  Together we're gonna be in the future and have real love and real justice and real unity compared to the division they sell in the name of unity.
[01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:30.274]  It's all division in the name of unity, disease and hate and murder and abuse in the name of unity, and it's all disunity, but under Christ there will be real unity.
[01:31:31.869 --> 01:31:32.969]  For a thousand years.
[01:31:34.349 --> 01:31:43.491]  And then, despite all the good we've seen, people are going to want to be satanic again, and God is going to release Satan for one more run at us.
[01:31:44.351 --> 01:31:45.132]  Because we asked for it.
[01:31:45.872 --> 01:31:51.293]  There will be devil worshippers a thousand years after this all unfolds, wanting to go back to what we're about to go through.
[01:31:52.133 --> 01:31:53.813]  And God will say, fine, free will, release him.
[01:31:54.813 --> 01:31:56.134]  Release the kraken.
[01:31:56.274 --> 01:31:57.234]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:02.692]  I do have a responsibility, and so do you, to get these wolves off of our children.
[01:32:03.952 --> 01:32:07.834]  And so, that's why I've said they're assaulting us with an offensive biological weapon.
[01:32:08.294 --> 01:32:13.256]  They're assaulting us with illegal, untested violations of the Nuremberg Code and the Geneva Convention.
[01:32:14.496 --> 01:32:15.777]  Hell, I had the author of the U.S.
[01:32:15.817 --> 01:32:22.500]  Biological Weapons Law on yesterday saying the exact same thing.
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:25.681]  I mean, we're not embellishing, we're not adding a damn thing to this.
[01:32:28.007 --> 01:32:34.430]  And so, there's a reason when you see all these world leaders up there getting the shots, they're not taking those damn things.
[01:32:35.690 --> 01:32:41.432]  This is a system that realigns your body against a basic protein, an amino acid in your body.
[01:32:43.573 --> 01:32:54.898]  You understand literally thousands of prominent geneticists have come out and said this is insane, this is mass murder, this is death, this is the gates of hell, this is releasing a monster.
[01:32:55.098 --> 01:32:55.698]  These are quotes.
[01:32:59.363 --> 01:33:00.644]  This was all unauthorized.
[01:33:00.844 --> 01:33:02.986]  They couldn't get any of this approved just two years ago.
[01:33:05.789 --> 01:33:13.376]  And now they're just doing it and getting enough of us to do it because they know once we do it to ourselves and our children, we'll decide it was okay.
[01:33:14.957 --> 01:33:16.979]  I'm going to get the shot no matter what you say.
[01:33:16.999 --> 01:33:17.940]  I'm going to protect others.
[01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:18.761]  And then they die.
[01:33:20.299 --> 01:33:23.482]  And their family members went, well, I'm willing to die too.
[01:33:23.642 --> 01:33:27.745]  I see the headlines, mainstream news, I'm willing to die to protect others.
[01:33:28.006 --> 01:33:31.308]  And they use our own instinct of life preservation to kill us!
[01:33:32.730 --> 01:33:35.872]  And it doesn't even protect you, the fine print says!
[01:33:39.035 --> 01:33:43.639]  There it is, journals proclaim she would love to die from the AstraZeneca vaccine if it helps others.
[01:33:45.768 --> 01:33:47.428]  All right, let's just rush through your calls here.
[01:33:47.828 --> 01:33:50.889]  In the order they're received, I'm trying to go as quick as possible.
[01:33:50.909 --> 01:33:52.489]  Let's talk to Steve in Tennessee.
[01:33:52.509 --> 01:33:56.130]  We had a call yesterday about a man losing his father to the vaccine.
[01:33:56.150 --> 01:33:56.910]  He was totally healthy.
[01:33:57.330 --> 01:33:57.671]  Died.
[01:33:57.691 --> 01:33:58.611]  Took him a week to die.
[01:33:59.131 --> 01:34:03.032]  Slowly paralyzed till he heart and lungs were paralyzed.
[01:34:03.072 --> 01:34:03.632]  Finally died.
[01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:06.152]  Another casualty of Bill Gates' war.
[01:34:06.552 --> 01:34:07.893]  Steve in Tennessee.
[01:34:07.933 --> 01:34:09.313]  Tell us what you've seen.
[01:34:11.338 --> 01:34:21.466]  Yes, this was actually about my mother-in-law, who received her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and she had sudden seizure-like activity.
[01:34:22.206 --> 01:34:25.669]  Also, they described it as violent tremors.
[01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:29.051]  She was taken to the emergency room via ambulance.
[01:34:29.892 --> 01:34:34.055]  She was hospitalized three days, had the million-dollar workup with no real findings.
[01:34:34.671 --> 01:34:37.892]  Long story short, she was a very active 81-year-old.
[01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:42.074]  She's now discharged at home with home health care.
[01:34:42.574 --> 01:34:44.755]  She's had her keys taken away.
[01:34:44.835 --> 01:34:46.076]  She can no longer drive.
[01:34:46.656 --> 01:34:47.816]  She's using a cane.
[01:34:49.497 --> 01:34:54.159]  So basically, who knows what's really going to happen with her at this point.
[01:34:54.179 --> 01:34:58.421]  But basically, her life was changed overnight.
[01:34:59.801 --> 01:35:01.062]  Do you know what vaccine she took?
[01:35:02.069 --> 01:35:03.029]  It was the Pfizer.
[01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:05.150]  The Pfizer mRNA gene therapy.
[01:35:05.230 --> 01:35:06.131]  Okay.
[01:35:06.151 --> 01:35:07.471]  Was it the first or second round?
[01:35:08.412 --> 01:35:09.332]  It was the second dose.
[01:35:09.852 --> 01:35:10.092]  Oh yeah.
[01:35:11.153 --> 01:35:12.073]  Wow.
[01:35:12.093 --> 01:35:12.914]  What does she think now?
[01:35:12.994 --> 01:35:14.214]  Is she a big advocate for it now?
[01:35:15.295 --> 01:35:23.878]  Well, my wife is a physician and she recommended that she not take it and she was basically or she told my wife that you know she was 81.
[01:35:24.358 --> 01:35:28.600]  She can make her own decisions and so I don't think she's too happy with what she's done.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.961]  But I also wanted to say with my wife working
[01:35:32.119 --> 01:35:34.480]  Hold on, talk right into your phone.
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.460]  Did he just take the vaccine too?
[01:35:55.897 --> 01:36:03.484]  And also there was someone come into the emergency room after the vaccination and they tested positive for COVID.
[01:36:04.204 --> 01:36:05.846]  So whatever we make of that.
[01:36:07.287 --> 01:36:10.970]  Wow, so I mean you're just seeing it to your left, your right, all around you.
[01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:14.873]  And the literature admits that you test positive after the vaccine usually.
[01:36:15.173 --> 01:36:19.177]  So have you seen where they admit that you can still get COVID even though you're vaccinated?
[01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:22.471]  Yes, and I'm actually seeing proof of it.
[01:36:22.491 --> 01:36:27.914]  Now granted, of course, I don't have patient names or any of that, but I hear a lot of stories about what's going on with it.
[01:36:28.294 --> 01:36:43.841]  And I did want to quickly ask you one question about when Trump went on, after he was discharged from Walter Reed, and he went on this big bandwagon about the Regeneron cocktail, I didn't hear any more of that.
[01:36:43.961 --> 01:36:45.642]  So whatever became of Regeneron?
[01:36:46.903 --> 01:36:52.187]  Well, it's a, it's a gene, uh, mouse, some type of mouse antibodies.
[01:36:52.227 --> 01:36:54.468]  And I mean, they can, they got all sorts of stuff to make you feel great.
[01:36:54.808 --> 01:37:01.132]  And if you're 75 and working your ass off, a lot of people have a lot of infections already in their blood and I'm sure whatever they gave him did clean him up.
[01:37:01.173 --> 01:37:02.694]  And so, you know, he, he looked great.
[01:37:02.754 --> 01:37:03.674]  Sounded great for about a month.
[01:37:04.074 --> 01:37:05.455]  The issue is you got to keep getting those.
[01:37:05.495 --> 01:37:07.737]  So, uh, yeah, we haven't heard about that since then.
[01:37:07.777 --> 01:37:08.437]  Thank you so much.
[01:37:08.497 --> 01:37:11.720]  And I'm glad to hear your mother-in-law and others aren't dead, but they may be soon.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:12.540]  Wow.
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.221]  Did you hear that?
[01:37:13.301 --> 01:37:16.423]  Two people in his family fight for their lives after the vaccine.
[01:37:17.363 --> 01:37:17.863]  Incredible.
[01:37:18.844 --> 01:37:20.884]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:37:21.665 --> 01:37:29.608]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Texas.
[01:37:29.648 --> 01:37:30.488]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:37:30.528 --> 01:37:30.808]  Welcome.
[01:37:32.549 --> 01:37:33.149]  Hey, Alex.
[01:37:34.469 --> 01:37:34.750]  Welcome.
[01:37:34.770 --> 01:37:35.030]  Go ahead.
[01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:43.833]  Yeah, I just talked to you on Monday and I just told you the story about a girl from back home in Minnesota that took the second dose of Moderna.
[01:37:44.637 --> 01:37:47.098]  And now she's having severe back pain and chest pain.
[01:37:47.138 --> 01:37:47.718]  Yes, you called.
[01:37:47.738 --> 01:37:57.162]  And then, literally two days later, my mom called and said, Grandma now is having heart problems after getting her second dose.
[01:37:59.503 --> 01:38:04.244]  Wow, yeah, that's what we see everywhere is convulsions and heart problems because it fries your nerves.
[01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:06.725]  So is your family starting to wake up?
[01:38:07.886 --> 01:38:09.306]  Yeah, my mom, it's hilarious.
[01:38:11.434 --> 01:38:14.435]  No effing way am I getting this vaccine.
[01:38:15.675 --> 01:38:16.475]  Let me ask you this.
[01:38:16.615 --> 01:38:18.456]  Why do you think Gates made his run at us?
[01:38:18.516 --> 01:38:22.496]  Because I thought it'd be a soft kill that kills you down the road, which the evidence shows it does.
[01:38:22.516 --> 01:38:23.977]  They already did animal studies secretly.
[01:38:24.697 --> 01:38:25.657]  They didn't skip those folks.
[01:38:25.677 --> 01:38:27.837]  They don't do animal studies because somebody dying gets sick.
[01:38:28.258 --> 01:38:29.598]  They already did them, again, secretly.
[01:38:29.938 --> 01:38:32.478]  Why do you think they're doing such a reckless run at us with this?
[01:38:32.538 --> 01:38:33.499]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:38:34.099 --> 01:38:35.859]  I was just going to say that, Isaac.
[01:38:35.899 --> 01:38:37.279]  They're coming full speed now.
[01:38:37.319 --> 01:38:38.720]  They want us dead now.
[01:38:43.854 --> 01:38:44.375]  Damn right.
[01:38:44.395 --> 01:38:49.578]  Well, you know, remember 10 years ago, the case for killing Granny Newsweek and Bill Gates was quoted saying we need to get rid of people above 75.
[01:38:49.679 --> 01:38:54.522]  Ezekiel Emanuel, who wrote Obamacare, said, I believe people should be killed at 75.
[01:38:54.782 --> 01:38:56.143]  I mean, these are psychotics, brother.
[01:38:57.324 --> 01:38:59.566]  You see, I love that.
[01:38:59.946 --> 01:39:03.589]  Rand Paul, what he did to Fauci the other day was just epic.
[01:39:03.689 --> 01:39:04.409]  It was incredible.
[01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:07.652]  We need more people like him and people like you.
[01:39:07.732 --> 01:39:08.532]  We need everybody.
[01:39:08.953 --> 01:39:10.494]  We need to attack these people.
[01:39:11.553 --> 01:39:12.274]  I totally agree.
[01:39:12.294 --> 01:39:12.854]  God bless you.
[01:39:13.014 --> 01:39:14.735]  I mean, look, you gotta get in people's faces.
[01:39:15.596 --> 01:39:20.320]  When I'm in a grocery store and they say, sir, wear your mask, I go, there are thousands of deaths from the vaccine.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:21.501]  It does not protect you.
[01:39:21.761 --> 01:39:23.322]  The masks give you bacterial pneumonia.
[01:39:23.522 --> 01:39:24.883]  The masks are never coming off.
[01:39:24.903 --> 01:39:25.904]  They go, sir, sir, we're fine.
[01:39:25.924 --> 01:39:26.304]  We're fine.
[01:39:26.524 --> 01:39:27.445]  Then they just shut down.
[01:39:27.705 --> 01:39:29.707]  They don't grab me, break my arm, call the police.
[01:39:29.747 --> 01:39:30.487]  They shut up.
[01:39:31.668 --> 01:39:35.011]  And I do it constantly because I'm not a slave.
[01:39:35.031 --> 01:39:35.451]  God bless you.
[01:39:35.491 --> 01:39:36.112]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:36.192 --> 01:39:36.452]  All right.
[01:39:38.075 --> 01:39:48.076]  Up next on the longest is Jason in North Carolina, then Julie in Maryland, Henry in Chicago, Granny Do-Right in Kentucky.
[01:39:49.221 --> 01:39:51.603]  And just everybody else, we're going to go to you and the order you received.
[01:39:52.224 --> 01:39:53.085]  I need to stay on air.
[01:39:53.145 --> 01:39:54.005]  I need money to do it.
[01:39:54.045 --> 01:39:57.408]  The enemy's trying to shut us down from a thousand angles, but thanks to you, we're still here.
[01:39:57.448 --> 01:39:58.589]  Plus, we sell products you need.
[01:39:58.950 --> 01:40:02.253]  And folks, everybody needs to boost their immune system, period.
[01:40:02.573 --> 01:40:04.194]  Well, Prostagard isn't just for the prostate.
[01:40:04.235 --> 01:40:12.582]  It's a great multivitamin with salt palmetto that, for whatever reason, is so good for all the glands in your body, not just your prostate, but that's the one that's been proven to be so anti-cancerous.
[01:40:12.602 --> 01:40:13.283]  You can even say that.
[01:40:14.924 --> 01:40:17.965]  The FDA is like, I can't say anything, but like, oh, Supplemental, we admit that, you know, does that.
[01:40:18.265 --> 01:40:19.506]  It's insane how good it is.
[01:40:19.846 --> 01:40:20.386]  It's good for men.
[01:40:20.406 --> 01:40:20.986]  It's good for women.
[01:40:21.026 --> 01:40:21.746]  It's back in stock.
[01:40:22.227 --> 01:40:23.147]  50% off.

[01:40:34.471 --> 01:40:36.732]  All the Emrix Essentials, the deodorant, all of it's natural.
[01:40:37.432 --> 01:40:38.732]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:40:39.132 --> 01:40:46.474]  And everybody should fortify with this and sunshine and clean water, but mainly worshipping God, opening up and praying every day in private.
[01:40:47.234 --> 01:40:52.055]  The globalists see themselves as God, as guardians of the earth.
[01:40:53.376 --> 01:41:02.017]  And they behave as if they have a gun to their head to carry out super unpopular, illegal euthanasia of the old, sterilization of the young.
[01:41:02.037 --> 01:41:04.358]  And they're setting the precedent
[01:41:05.848 --> 01:41:09.231]  For us to have jobs or be able to move about, to take whatever they want to put in our bodies.
[01:41:09.251 --> 01:41:21.079]  We always said global government is about digital passports proving you've been vaccinated with whatever they want to put in your body as gene therapies, including viruses that actually attack parts of the brain.
[01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:24.562]  And they say, oh, it's an anti-stress vaccine.
[01:41:25.142 --> 01:41:27.524]  So they can load anything they want into these viruses.
[01:41:28.305 --> 01:41:29.405]  It's all proprietary.
[01:41:30.166 --> 01:41:32.047]  And this is next level engineering.
[01:41:32.808 --> 01:41:33.949]  Have you seen the Bourne movies?
[01:41:35.503 --> 01:41:37.464]  Well, they have one of the Bourne movies, I forget the name.
[01:41:37.484 --> 01:41:39.965]  I think it's Bourne Origin.
[01:41:41.305 --> 01:41:47.948]  It's the one that goes back where they came from, and it's a virus they inject them with that goes in and destroys parts of the brain of inhibition.
[01:41:49.429 --> 01:41:55.391]  Because let's say if I can bench press 300 pounds, if I take my governor away, I can bench press 600 pounds.
[01:41:56.472 --> 01:41:57.852]  We have governors that block us.
[01:41:59.113 --> 01:42:01.634]  Well, in the movie, the virus has gone in and reprogrammed the brain.
[01:42:03.339 --> 01:42:04.400]  That's all real, folks.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.142]  And just type in Chinese Super Soldiers.
[01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:08.643]  That's what they've been doing to them.
[01:42:09.824 --> 01:42:11.164]  Yeah, born legacy of Gene.
[01:42:11.705 --> 01:42:14.987]  Dope Super Spies aren't as far-fetched as they sound.
[01:42:15.888 --> 01:42:17.829]  And I told you back when it first came out that was the case.
[01:42:18.329 --> 01:42:21.372]  So, so, this is already going on in the lab.
[01:42:21.412 --> 01:42:22.052]  It's already here.
[01:42:22.352 --> 01:42:23.273]  They want to roll it out.
[01:42:23.553 --> 01:42:26.055]  But it's not where you get Super Soldier powers.
[01:42:26.315 --> 01:42:27.396]  It's where you die in a year.
[01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:31.111]  So, they're not going to give you all the good stuff.
[01:42:31.131 --> 01:42:31.912]  They're going to give you death.
[01:42:31.932 --> 01:42:33.293]  Alright, let's go to the phone calls.
[01:42:35.735 --> 01:42:37.676]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in California.
[01:42:37.716 --> 01:42:38.557]  John, you're on the air.
[01:42:38.577 --> 01:42:40.998]  Go ahead and tell us what you witnessed with the loving vaccines.
[01:42:42.519 --> 01:42:42.780]  Alex.
[01:42:44.261 --> 01:42:44.921]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:42:46.462 --> 01:42:49.364]  My father took the shot, I'd say about three weeks ago.
[01:42:49.404 --> 01:42:51.646]  He was in the hospital about seven to eight days.
[01:42:52.126 --> 01:42:53.027]  His color changed.
[01:42:53.067 --> 01:42:53.987]  He turned gray.
[01:42:55.028 --> 01:42:57.109]  After he took the shot, he went outside and tried to
[01:42:58.806 --> 01:42:59.786]  Your father isn't stupid.
[01:42:59.826 --> 01:43:01.027]  He is in a medical trance.
[01:43:01.047 --> 01:43:04.748]  TV, especially with older people, puts them into a near-sleep daydream.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:32.725]  And so just type in, study links mRNA vaccines to brain fog Alzheimer's.
[01:43:33.566 --> 01:43:35.067]  And then you can just give them the literature.
[01:43:35.087 --> 01:43:36.868]  But I think he knows that now.
[01:43:37.509 --> 01:43:40.891]  What it does is it, it manipulates proteins in the body.
[01:43:40.911 --> 01:43:45.434]  Well, a lot of people have prion or prion type stuff in the brain when they're older.
[01:43:46.337 --> 01:43:51.359]  And so when you take one of these, it causes a ballooning in those tissues.
[01:43:51.399 --> 01:43:54.220]  That's why they say, oh, you don't have cancer when you take the mRNA vaccine.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:56.781]  It'll just make all your tissues look like you have cancer.
[01:43:57.221 --> 01:43:58.542]  So, sir, it's a weapon.
[01:43:59.002 --> 01:43:59.562]  It's horrible.
[01:44:00.122 --> 01:44:06.225]  And, you know, I mean, if your father ever comes back to normal, he needs to realize that he was hit hard.
[01:44:06.465 --> 01:44:08.826]  But see, men are especially like, I'm rough and tough.
[01:44:08.866 --> 01:44:09.646]  I'm not going to be a wimp.
[01:44:11.342 --> 01:44:17.604]  That's the problem with conservatives or just normal people is they're designed to just get over something and not make a big deal about it.
[01:44:18.004 --> 01:44:21.825]  But no, no, we have to all act like leftists and run around and warn everybody and scream and yell.
[01:44:22.065 --> 01:44:24.345]  Now the left's not going to run around screaming and yell.
[01:44:24.365 --> 01:44:26.586]  Because let me tell you, the left's not taking these vaccines.
[01:44:26.606 --> 01:44:27.306]  They know what they're doing.
[01:44:27.766 --> 01:44:29.107]  They are a demon cult, sir.
[01:44:31.687 --> 01:44:33.288]  Yeah, his color has changed.
[01:44:33.428 --> 01:44:35.228]  You can look at him and he looks gray now.
[01:44:35.868 --> 01:44:37.109]  I call that the green look.
[01:44:37.289 --> 01:44:37.789]  Absolutely.
[01:44:37.829 --> 01:44:38.289]  It's not good.
[01:44:39.389 --> 01:44:41.572]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:41.952 --> 01:44:44.535]  Every cell in his body is being taken over by viruses.
[01:44:44.876 --> 01:44:45.577]  That's what this is.
[01:44:46.418 --> 01:44:47.579]  Did he take an mRNA vaccine?
[01:44:47.599 --> 01:44:48.160]  Which one did he take?
[01:44:49.201 --> 01:44:49.581]  You know what?
[01:44:49.601 --> 01:44:50.683]  I'm not exactly sure.
[01:44:50.943 --> 01:44:51.744]  I didn't go with him.
[01:44:52.365 --> 01:44:57.251]  Well, if he took the Moderna or the Pfizer, that's an mRNA and reprograms everything.
[01:44:58.593 --> 01:44:59.894]  Oh wow, yeah.
[01:44:59.914 --> 01:45:04.857]  But also, I own a business, and my business, I make nobody wear a mask.
[01:45:04.877 --> 01:45:11.162]  I have a lot of younger guys, nobody wears a mask.
[01:45:11.202 --> 01:45:15.705]  We really try hard to push your, basically, hey, this is a lie.
[01:45:16.325 --> 01:45:18.447]  Everything that they're telling us is BS.
[01:45:19.087 --> 01:45:20.748]  Try to think for yourself, ask information.
[01:45:22.069 --> 01:45:33.598]  You know, I just try to be, you know, I'm lucky that I've, you know, we've ran a good business during this pandemic, man, and we've tried to maintain some normalcy for a lot of people.
[01:45:33.618 --> 01:45:37.882]  Well, God bless you being an island in a sea of insanity, and God bless your dad, and I hope it gets better.
[01:45:38.282 --> 01:45:42.766]  Give your dad, I'm not a doctor, but if I was you, a lot of it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:45:43.246 --> 01:45:46.789]  I would get him on, the doctors won't tell you this, and I'm not giving you advice, that's what I would do.
[01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:49.031]  I would take some Benadryl.
[01:45:50.174 --> 01:45:57.480]  If I was him, I'd put him on a regular non-prescription dose of Benadryl for about a week and see if that gets the inflammation in his brain down.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.421]  Thanks for the call.
[01:45:59.181 --> 01:45:59.581]  Okay.
[01:46:01.623 --> 01:46:03.444]  I'm gonna go to Julie in Maryland the next.
[01:46:03.565 --> 01:46:07.828]  Dan says, five celebrities that have died from the vaccine no one is talking about.
[01:46:08.428 --> 01:46:12.712]  They talked about Hank Aaron, they talked some about Marvelous Marvin Hagler, but who else is he talking about?
[01:46:12.732 --> 01:46:13.672]  We'll talk to him next segment.
[01:46:13.973 --> 01:46:18.216]  But right now, let's go to Julie in Maryland.
[01:46:18.256 --> 01:46:19.197]  Julie, thanks for holding.
[01:46:24.926 --> 01:46:25.868]  Sounds like you're angry.
[01:46:26.690 --> 01:46:27.772]  I'm Uncle Alex.
[01:46:28.132 --> 01:46:31.940]  My mom, my 80-year-old mom, you woke her up.
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:34.244]  Please say hello to her.
[01:46:34.605 --> 01:46:34.946]  I do.
[01:46:34.986 --> 01:46:35.727]  Hello, mom.
[01:46:35.767 --> 01:46:36.208]  We love you.
[01:46:36.248 --> 01:46:36.749]  What's your name?
[01:46:37.932 --> 01:46:39.073]  Well, it's Elizabeth.
[01:46:39.393 --> 01:46:40.254]  Hi, Alex!
[01:46:40.434 --> 01:46:42.055]  We just love you!
[01:46:42.395 --> 01:46:43.676]  Well, we love you too, Elizabeth.
[01:46:43.696 --> 01:46:44.777]  Please tell folks about the show.
[01:46:44.817 --> 01:46:45.738]  We're trying to save lives.
[01:46:46.038 --> 01:46:47.599]  What is it like to hear all these stories?
[01:46:48.199 --> 01:46:50.381]  Alright, so listen, Alex.
[01:46:50.801 --> 01:46:54.884]  We hear them all day long, but I want to tell you this real quick.
[01:46:54.924 --> 01:46:56.765]  This is a highlight of my year.
[01:46:57.245 --> 01:46:58.806]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:46:58.906 --> 01:47:03.650]  We have Band-Op video or InfoWars on all of our four vehicles.
[01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:05.551]  You woke my mom up.
[01:47:06.269 --> 01:47:15.073]  People say on the response, like the comments, that they're saying there are lies about the products.
[01:47:15.373 --> 01:47:16.934]  We love your products.
[01:47:16.954 --> 01:47:19.856]  You didn't have any toothpaste because we bought it all.
[01:47:20.936 --> 01:47:29.540]  You're not going to like this, but I'm telling you, anybody that's been listening for over a year and is not supporting you, I want you to hang up right now.
[01:47:30.021 --> 01:47:34.223]  You need to support InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:35.836 --> 01:47:40.038]  And I want to tell you, Alex, we live on a street with 16 other people.
[01:47:40.058 --> 01:47:43.980]  We're one of three people that refused to take the vaccine.
[01:47:44.821 --> 01:47:46.962]  I'm not... I used to be a nice person.
[01:47:47.642 --> 01:47:49.383]  I'm not a nice person anymore.
[01:47:49.403 --> 01:47:53.005]  I school everybody I come in contact with.
[01:47:53.605 --> 01:47:55.626]  I tell them, I say... Well, let me interrupt you, Julie.
[01:47:55.646 --> 01:47:56.707]  You are a nice person.
[01:47:56.767 --> 01:47:58.088]  They say it's nice to lay down and die.
[01:47:58.128 --> 01:48:00.449]  You're a nice person standing up and warning people.
[01:48:01.709 --> 01:48:02.630]  I'm a snot.
[01:48:03.797 --> 01:48:06.418]  And thank you for saying that, but I'm not nice.
[01:48:06.538 --> 01:48:07.738]  I'm tired of people.
[01:48:08.139 --> 01:48:08.879]  I'm tired of them.
[01:48:09.899 --> 01:48:12.260]  I ask everybody, excuse me, sir.
[01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:13.220]  Excuse me, ma'am.
[01:48:13.261 --> 01:48:14.501]  Can I ask you a question?
[01:48:14.861 --> 01:48:16.382]  Are you going to take the vaccine?
[01:48:16.882 --> 01:48:17.662]  Yes, I am.
[01:48:17.902 --> 01:48:18.763]  Can't wait to get it.
[01:48:19.063 --> 01:48:21.263]  Please, ma'am, don't take the vaccine.
[01:48:21.504 --> 01:48:23.904]  This morning I had my mom call my sister.
[01:48:24.285 --> 01:48:26.926]  Please, Lisa, don't take the vaccine.
[01:48:27.226 --> 01:48:29.046]  No, we're going to take the vaccine.
[01:48:29.066 --> 01:48:29.086]  I
[01:48:31.898 --> 01:48:33.299]  I wake up every morning.
[01:48:33.539 --> 01:48:35.301]  I start listening to Harrison.
[01:48:35.321 --> 01:48:36.782]  I listen to you.
[01:48:36.802 --> 01:48:39.044]  Then I listen to Owen.
[01:48:39.304 --> 01:48:41.045]  I have you on all day long.
[01:48:41.145 --> 01:48:43.807]  You blow out my battery on my telephone every day.
[01:48:43.827 --> 01:48:48.831]  Ma'am, you're beautiful, but listen, keep warning folks, and we'll edit down all the callers that have family members dying.
[01:48:49.191 --> 01:48:51.513]  Hopefully you can just make your neighbors watch this info.
[01:48:51.753 --> 01:48:52.213]  But you know what?
[01:48:52.233 --> 01:48:52.874]  Here's the good news.
[01:48:52.974 --> 01:48:53.715]  It's the bad news, too.
[01:48:54.055 --> 01:48:57.097]  When they get hurt from the vaccine, they'll be awake permanently if they survive.
[01:48:59.339 --> 01:48:59.439]  Oh!
[01:49:02.626 --> 01:49:03.386]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:04.287 --> 01:49:06.968]  I tell everybody I can and they don't want to know.
[01:49:07.388 --> 01:49:08.429]  Julie, listen here.
[01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:10.270]  It's been happening for 27 years.
[01:49:10.630 --> 01:49:11.510]  Later, they'll listen.
[01:49:11.530 --> 01:49:12.111]  God bless you.
[01:49:12.491 --> 01:49:14.472]  And whoever told you about the show, Julie, they're on.
[01:49:14.652 --> 01:49:15.612]  Quickly, Julie, in 10 seconds.
[01:49:15.833 --> 01:49:16.853]  How'd you learn about InfoWars?
[01:49:18.154 --> 01:49:19.874]  Um, golly, Alex.
[01:49:21.195 --> 01:49:22.416]  Maybe from Mark Dice.
[01:49:22.436 --> 01:49:23.656]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:23.696 --> 01:49:24.637]  Alright, God bless you.
[01:49:25.902 --> 01:49:32.606]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're hearing caller after caller after caller that has lost family members or had them have heart attacks or become deathly ill.
[01:49:33.147 --> 01:49:34.728]  And then we see it all over the world.
[01:49:34.848 --> 01:49:37.990]  India banned the Pfizer shot.
[01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:40.512]  They're moving to ban the other mRNA shots.
[01:49:41.573 --> 01:49:45.334]  In Australia, the other vaccine was giving HIV positive test.
[01:49:46.294 --> 01:49:47.794]  You've got all this mass death happening.
[01:49:47.834 --> 01:49:54.736]  They say it's not going to protect you because they could never make a vaccine for the common cold because it's such a part of our body.
[01:49:54.776 --> 01:49:56.156]  There's so many of these viruses.
[01:49:57.457 --> 01:50:02.158]  So it's going to cause autoimmune responses to regular viruses and just kill you or make you wish you were dead.
[01:50:02.698 --> 01:50:04.778]  It's going to shut your immune system off or turn it up too high.
[01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:05.679]  It's going to give you cancer.
[01:50:05.979 --> 01:50:08.219]  And you hear the calls flooding in.
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:10.940]  And you try to talk about it.
[01:50:12.748 --> 01:50:21.396]  And the video goes viral, you're a medical doctor, you're a scientist, you're the former head of Rockefeller Hospital, and you come out and say this a year ago?
[01:50:22.197 --> 01:50:27.061]  Their head scientist said, oh, this is gonna cause mutations, the vaccine, which they now admit, mainline news.
[01:50:27.321 --> 01:50:30.204]  But I say that, or a doctor says that, YouTube takes it down!
[01:50:31.225 --> 01:50:32.586]  Aiding and abetting this murder!
[01:50:33.927 --> 01:50:37.751]  So, they've crossed the Rubicon, they've drawn major first blood here.
[01:50:40.034 --> 01:50:43.456]  That shows they're going for broke and are planning even bigger escalations in the future.
[01:50:43.836 --> 01:50:45.537]  That's what Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and others say is.
[01:50:46.238 --> 01:50:50.000]  Within six months to a year, it's going to cause massive autoimmune responses, even bigger.
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:53.282]  They're going to say it's a new COVID variant when it's the vaccine killing people.
[01:50:54.463 --> 01:50:56.764]  They've always wondered why the Spanish flu killed 50 million people.
[01:50:57.064 --> 01:51:01.927]  They were having an autoimmune response to a flu virus that they already had been in contact with.
[01:51:02.748 --> 01:51:06.130]  But for some reason, when they came back in contact with it, they died in hours.
[01:51:07.281 --> 01:51:08.422]  from an autoimmune response.
[01:51:08.462 --> 01:51:12.263]  And they won't tell the doctors, give them a steroid, give them Benadryl.
[01:51:12.303 --> 01:51:13.864]  They won't tell anybody when this happens.
[01:51:14.764 --> 01:51:15.945]  They go, oh, you've got COVID.
[01:51:15.965 --> 01:51:17.606]  Well, wait, I took a COVID shot two weeks ago.
[01:51:17.866 --> 01:51:19.226]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[01:51:19.967 --> 01:51:25.029]  We're going to put a tube down your throat and blow your lungs up that during an autoimmune response will kill you faster.
[01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:28.170]  That's how technocrats work.
[01:51:28.190 --> 01:51:30.491]  They know the general public doesn't have technological understanding.
[01:51:31.152 --> 01:51:35.954]  And so they set it all where it's like a black box to us, but they know exactly what's going to unfold.
[01:51:37.381 --> 01:51:39.502]  Yeah, you gotta watch that interview with her.
[01:51:39.542 --> 01:51:41.763]  It's got a million and a half views and needs 50 million views.
[01:51:41.883 --> 01:51:45.704]  Medical doctor exposes mass eugenics experimentation called COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:51:46.024 --> 01:51:46.685]  Bandai video.
[01:51:47.365 --> 01:51:48.705]  Share that like your lives depend on it.
[01:51:50.246 --> 01:51:55.848]  Let's go to Andrew and then we'll go to Dan and others.
[01:51:56.328 --> 01:52:01.070]  Andrew, tell us your take on and what you've seen with these so-called vaccines.
[01:52:02.431 --> 01:52:02.771]  Yes, sir.
[01:52:03.769 --> 01:52:08.370]  So, uh, going back all the way to last summer, I tried calling in whenever I first started last summer.
[01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:17.091]  And what my mother-in-law saw was, um, she was a nurse and she actually had COVID.
[01:52:18.212 --> 01:52:23.793]  And whenever she had COVID, uh, they were trying to give her treatment and she had asthma.
[01:52:24.833 --> 01:52:31.754]  And so it affected more her, more, more so than, uh, her husband and
[01:52:32.885 --> 01:53:02.346]  Because she had asthma and so my father-in-law he wasn't affected at all by COVID because he didn't have any comorbidities and so at the same time that that was going on on that same side of the family I had a family member that developed that had COVID and he was perfectly healthy and whenever they put him on the ventilator that's whenever he died
[01:53:03.104 --> 01:53:06.026]  And they put COVID-19 on the death certificate.
[01:53:07.047 --> 01:53:08.027]  So let's be clear.
[01:53:08.067 --> 01:53:09.748]  He was healthy but tested positive.
[01:53:09.768 --> 01:53:10.769]  Probably a false positive.
[01:53:10.789 --> 01:53:12.790]  They killed him with a ventilator.
[01:53:12.850 --> 01:53:13.191]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:13.351 --> 01:53:17.834]  And everybody knew there that he died from bacterial pneumonia.
[01:53:18.314 --> 01:53:25.639]  But in order for them, like, I'm not there, but what I assumed was that they could get that money that everybody knew that they were getting.
[01:53:25.659 --> 01:53:27.140]  $53,000 if they intubate you, yeah.
[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:27.980]  And he was perfectly healthy.
[01:53:31.147 --> 01:53:35.268]  And whenever she had to be taken to the hospital, she said that she got an IV drip, and that was all.
[01:53:35.328 --> 01:53:36.748]  And she said she didn't want anything else.
[01:53:37.848 --> 01:53:39.949]  And so... You're damn right, sir.
[01:53:39.969 --> 01:53:41.209]  That is a horrible situation.
[01:53:42.289 --> 01:53:46.970]  And so, going to current, she just had her second dose of the vaccine.
[01:53:48.471 --> 01:53:51.111]  She hasn't came out and said, like, they made us get it or else.
[01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:54.052]  But that's the sentiment that everybody feels.
[01:53:54.092 --> 01:53:55.972]  So everybody's just going along, get along.
[01:53:56.012 --> 01:53:57.712]  That's social pressure.
[01:53:57.892 --> 01:54:00.193]  And whenever she got the second vaccine,
[01:54:01.108 --> 01:54:03.790]  Um, she had a hard time lifting up her arms.
[01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:06.192]  Like, she didn't have any kind of paralysis.
[01:54:06.212 --> 01:54:15.518]  She can still move, but it made her complete, like, where she couldn't lift her arms up to even lift any weight, where her body hurt so much.
[01:54:16.079 --> 01:54:16.779]  That's insane, Andrew.
[01:54:16.819 --> 01:54:17.479]  We gotta jump.
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.640]  Thank you for your testimony.
[01:54:19.001 --> 01:54:19.581]  God bless you.
[01:54:20.141 --> 01:54:26.726]  Alright, Dan in Florida says five celebrities that have died from vaccine, no one talks about it.
[01:54:26.846 --> 01:54:28.027]  Tell us the names that you've noticed.
[01:54:29.622 --> 01:54:30.543]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:54:30.623 --> 01:54:32.924]  I'll skip the pleasantries and just get right to it.
[01:54:33.284 --> 01:54:40.648]  There's been seven famous all-black people, healthy celebrities, to die in the past two months.
[01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:43.910]  We all know about Marvin Hagler and Hank Aaron.
[01:54:44.522 --> 01:54:54.250]  There is Vincent Jackson, the former Pro Bowl NFL wide receiver for the Buccaneers and Chargers, died at only 38 in his hotel room.
[01:54:54.590 --> 01:55:06.400]  Police said alcoholism and CTE could have played a role, but the family, as soon as that came out, released a statement disputing that, saying they don't speak for them.
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:13.406]  There is two sports journalists, Sekou Smith and Therese Paylor, both passed away
[01:55:14.059 --> 01:55:20.305]  In their late 30s, no listed causes of death, no follow-up reports in the months that have passed.
[01:55:20.725 --> 01:55:30.815]  And I actually am pretty sure I've been able to independently confirm that Therese Taylor was killed by the vaccine because I tweeted this information the other day and included his name.
[01:55:30.835 --> 01:55:34.038]  And I get a like on it from a blue checkmark.
[01:55:34.118 --> 01:55:35.059]  I check who she is.
[01:55:35.529 --> 01:55:36.810]  Her name's Ebony Reed.
[01:55:36.970 --> 01:55:44.836]  She's a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, and she was Perez Taylor's fiancée, and she's liking my tweet saying that the vaccine killed him.
[01:55:46.057 --> 01:55:53.282]  Uh, then there's also Mary- Hagler's friends and family said it, and then they got pressured, and then, uh, it's crazy.
[01:55:53.322 --> 01:56:00.428]  Then they lied and said that, uh, Frank- Hank Aaron died, uh, of natural causes, but now the family said no, it was the vaccine.
[01:56:02.443 --> 01:56:04.003]  Yeah, it's insane.
[01:56:04.144 --> 01:56:05.324]  They're covering all these up.
[01:56:05.424 --> 01:56:05.984]  I mean, who knows?
[01:56:06.004 --> 01:56:08.305]  The scary part is that these are all black people.
[01:56:08.345 --> 01:56:13.166]  We know Bill Gates really... Brother, they don't want me to say the names, and I'm going to leave it alone.
[01:56:13.866 --> 01:56:20.088]  But there was a black guy at my school that ended up going to play for UT, and he was married to another black lady that went to my school that I didn't know.
[01:56:20.768 --> 01:56:21.969]  But I knew him a little bit.
[01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:27.190]  And I heard they both died in the news of COVID, and I went and checked, and they'd just taken the vaccine.
[01:56:27.490 --> 01:56:28.431]  And these are 47-year-old black people.
[01:56:30.649 --> 01:56:42.720]  And so yeah, that's why it's like Black Lives Matter on every channel, we love black people, we love blacks, we love blacks, we love blacks, we love, oh gosh, oh, Fauci loves blacks, Bill Gates wants blacks to have the shots first, and it's literally murdering them.
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:44.182]  I mean, you just can't make this up.
[01:56:46.343 --> 01:56:52.785]  Also, Marion Ramsey, who was in Police Academy, she died when the shots first started coming out in New York.
[01:56:53.465 --> 01:56:54.206]  She was 73.
[01:56:54.266 --> 01:56:56.827]  There's no listed cause of death, no follow-up reports.
[01:56:57.227 --> 01:57:04.029]  Then this past week, the wide receiver, former NFL wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, his daughter died at only 25.
[01:57:05.269 --> 01:57:06.930]  There's no listed cause of death.
[01:57:07.486 --> 01:57:11.690]  No report, no, it's just all, nobody can, nobody knows anything.
[01:57:11.730 --> 01:57:15.434]  A 25-year-old dies, he's famous, and there's no info on what happened?
[01:57:15.654 --> 01:57:17.215]  I mean, does that sound normal?
[01:57:19.397 --> 01:57:21.219]  Incredible, sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:57:21.279 --> 01:57:32.410]  Let's put that photo back up of Bill Gates giving the oral polio vaccine to the loving black baby he wants to take care of, and then type in, Bill Gates, polio vaccine caused polio, Reuters.
[01:57:33.658 --> 01:57:34.939]  Oh, thank you, Bill Gates.
[01:57:35.019 --> 01:57:37.120]  Here's some SV40 cancer virus for you.
[01:57:38.861 --> 01:57:39.221]  There it is.
[01:57:39.261 --> 01:57:41.623]  How the oral polio vaccine can cause polio.
[01:57:44.264 --> 01:57:45.065]  That's from a couple years ago.
[01:57:45.105 --> 01:57:46.726]  The latest is actually last year.
[01:57:50.048 --> 01:57:58.053]  When we come back, we're going to go directly to Henry and then Granny Do-Right.
[01:57:59.366 --> 01:58:02.568]  And then Nathan, Mike, Josh, Jason, and everybody else.
[01:58:02.588 --> 01:58:04.950]  We're going to get to everybody here today.
[01:58:05.391 --> 01:58:06.872]  Stephen's active duty in Washington.
[01:58:07.432 --> 01:58:08.993]  Let's talk about what's come up with the COVID vaccines.
[01:58:09.013 --> 01:58:10.374]  We've heard from the military, not just the caller.
[01:58:10.394 --> 01:58:14.417]  I got other calls saying, yeah, they've told the military, everybody's got to take it starting in July.
[01:58:14.938 --> 01:58:15.758]  Well, it's experimental.
[01:58:15.838 --> 01:58:16.299]  It's illegal.
[01:58:17.199 --> 01:58:18.701]  But see, they'll have enough people that have taken it.
[01:58:18.721 --> 01:58:20.102]  They're like, well, the people are taking it.
[01:58:20.482 --> 01:58:21.383]  You're taking it too.
[01:58:22.435 --> 01:58:26.116]  But they can't, under law, give the military experimental vaccines.
[01:58:26.837 --> 01:58:30.138]  They can order them to take other vaccines if they're, quote, approved by the FDA.
[01:58:30.158 --> 01:58:30.898]  That's still dangerous.
[01:58:31.758 --> 01:58:33.879]  You talk about guinea pigs, that's all coming up.
[01:58:34.399 --> 01:58:37.941]  There's a bunch of breaking news on Infowars.com, a lot of other angles I haven't gotten to, but...
[01:58:38.766 --> 01:58:44.448]  And we've also got China and Russia and how Biden fell down three times getting on the airplane.
[01:58:44.608 --> 01:58:45.349]  That's all coming up.
[01:58:45.389 --> 01:58:49.290]  But I want to get through these calls first, and then we're going to shift gears.
[01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:55.653]  We're going to get into the economy and Russia and China and where all this humiliation is going.
[01:58:55.693 --> 01:58:56.073]  Stay with us.
[01:58:57.441 --> 01:58:59.162]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:58:59.763 --> 01:59:02.365]  And I'm telling you, TV viewer, the video is incredible.
[01:59:02.405 --> 01:59:10.810]  Joe Biden falling down, not once, not twice, but three times, scrabbling like a dying cat on a hot tin roof.
[01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:21.878]  I mean, this is emblematic at every level of globalism and where our civilization and where our society is and how, yeah, careful what you wish for.
[01:59:21.898 --> 01:59:23.199]  They installed this puppet.
[01:59:24.867 --> 01:59:27.470]  And now China is in our face at events saying we're a joke.
[01:59:27.590 --> 01:59:28.251]  Russia is.
[01:59:29.112 --> 01:59:33.696]  And Biden just responds by empty threats to people, but then is scared to be part of debates.
[01:59:33.796 --> 01:59:34.317]  It's incredible.
[01:59:34.337 --> 01:59:36.119]  All right, we've got a lot of amazing calls.
[01:59:36.159 --> 01:59:37.180]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:59:40.123 --> 01:59:50.508]  We are taking calls from people to give us your take on the so-called vaccines, your take on the mRNA vaccines, your take on the virus vector vaccines of AstraZeneca and of course Johnson & Johnson.
[01:59:50.548 --> 01:59:54.690]  What's your view on all this and how they're trying to cover up the massive side effects?
[01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:58.732]  I want to get to a bunch of calls this segment because they've all got incredible points.
[01:59:59.092 --> 02:00:01.233]  Henry in Chicago, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:00:02.907 --> 02:00:04.408]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my phone call.
[02:00:04.428 --> 02:00:05.228]  I love your products.
[02:00:05.288 --> 02:00:08.470]  I love the DNA Force and your Alexa water purification system.
[02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.470]  They're great.
[02:00:09.871 --> 02:00:15.533]  Now, my point is, we need to make people aware to protect us against these globalists.
[02:00:15.954 --> 02:00:26.319]  There's a first court case against mandatory vaccination filed in New Mexico by attorney Anna Gardner on behalf of a county employee where they want to make it mandatory.
[02:00:27.043 --> 02:00:32.545]  Now, there's another doctor who's suing the mandate or the emergency.
[02:00:32.585 --> 02:00:40.449]  Her name is Dr. Pam Popper, which they want to start the mandatory vaccines because they're going to enforce the passport.
[02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:41.790]  That's a violation of our rights.
[02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:49.033]  And we are under attack as Americans, and we need to defend our country and to the Constitution.
[02:00:49.133 --> 02:00:53.014]  And one thing that I'm very upset, Trump betrayed us.
[02:00:53.335 --> 02:00:55.295]  And I'm going to give you four things why I think he betrayed us.
[02:00:55.716 --> 02:00:56.276]  He never filed
[02:00:58.067 --> 02:01:01.809]  He never got rid of the mask mandate or the emergency call.
[02:01:01.989 --> 02:01:04.411]  He never went after the 230 tech companies.
[02:01:05.532 --> 02:01:13.597]  He never stripped the immunity from big tech.
[02:01:13.957 --> 02:01:18.020]  He implemented the red flag for the Violent Second Amendment.
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:19.241]  I think he betrayed us.
[02:01:19.421 --> 02:01:23.804]  I mean, I was some supporter, but now I will not vote for him because he threw us under the bus.
[02:01:25.184 --> 02:01:26.184]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:01:26.264 --> 02:01:28.265]  At his rallies, he didn't wear a mask.
[02:01:28.305 --> 02:01:28.965]  He encouraged it.
[02:01:29.005 --> 02:01:30.126]  He tried to have it both ways.
[02:01:30.166 --> 02:01:30.806]  He was overwhelmed.
[02:01:31.386 --> 02:01:33.526]  I think Trump overall is a good guy, but I hear you.
[02:01:34.047 --> 02:01:45.430]  Criticism of him is completely reasonable and is good, so that if it's going to be the party of Trump going forward better than the party of the neocons or rhinos, we need to make sure that Trump is basically singing to our sheep.
[02:01:46.868 --> 02:01:48.008]  I think so.
[02:02:16.827 --> 02:02:21.450]  Alex, a few minutes ago you kind of shot from the hip giving advice to one of your callers.
[02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:27.374]  I think his father was ailing from post-vaccine problems.
[02:02:28.175 --> 02:02:29.936]  You mentioned Benadryl.
[02:02:30.857 --> 02:02:32.758]  Benadryl has nothing to do with inflammation.
[02:02:33.823 --> 02:02:40.926]  It does in a very abstract sense, but what he wants to get his father on is some kind of steroids.
[02:02:41.547 --> 02:02:50.291]  I think there are inhaled steroids that you can get over the counter at Walgreens or basically any pharmacy.
[02:02:51.431 --> 02:02:52.492]  Sure, and I'm no doctor.
[02:02:52.532 --> 02:02:56.534]  I did see that big emergency room head doctor in, what was it, in North Texas.
[02:02:57.534 --> 02:02:58.695]  It was Northwest Texas.
[02:02:58.715 --> 02:03:01.977]  He said that he's given it to hundreds of people, the inhalable steroid.
[02:03:02.057 --> 02:03:03.257]  It knocked it out within hours.
[02:03:03.657 --> 02:03:04.958]  And so that's why I said steroid in general.
[02:03:05.378 --> 02:03:11.301]  I just know that when I'm having an allergic response, or I've got like a rash, or I've got inflammation, I take Benadryl.
[02:03:11.322 --> 02:03:14.963]  So I was just guessing that that might, you know, I'm not a doctor.
[02:03:15.003 --> 02:03:15.544]  I was just saying,
[02:03:16.444 --> 02:03:19.185]  It just seems like they should tell people, go after inflammation.
[02:03:19.205 --> 02:03:21.486]  So you're saying as a doctor, steroids is the answer.
[02:03:21.506 --> 02:03:22.146]  Tell us about that.
[02:03:22.166 --> 02:03:24.807]  Yeah, steroids.
[02:03:25.147 --> 02:03:27.047]  I mean, that's your body's defense.
[02:03:27.548 --> 02:03:40.912]  Your adrenal gland pumps out corticosteroids naturally to help fight inflammation and also is synthesized and released in response to stress.
[02:03:43.670 --> 02:03:46.032]  Benadryl is good for sleep.
[02:03:46.352 --> 02:03:49.975]  I use it occasionally when I'm having sleep issues.
[02:03:50.055 --> 02:03:50.996]  I said I'm not a doctor.
[02:03:51.076 --> 02:03:53.378]  I was just throwing out what I do when I'm having an allergic response.
[02:03:53.418 --> 02:03:55.700]  Benadryl liquid seems to work for me.
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:57.761]  But that just shows I don't have a medical degree.
[02:03:58.542 --> 02:04:01.704]  But I have seen in the news they say steroid inhalers have been really successful.
[02:04:02.064 --> 02:04:03.846]  And then I saw Fauci try to shut that down.
[02:04:05.054 --> 02:04:14.158]  Yeah, I saw an interview with that West Texas ER doc who was using it for several hundred patients and with great success.
[02:04:15.399 --> 02:04:31.486]  What does it sound like to you, his dad takes it, they have studies that say it causes brain fog, what would you do, not treating anything over the phone here, but I mean, if that was your dad and he had brain fog and was basically in another world after a vaccine, what would you do?
[02:04:33.345 --> 02:04:34.285]  I'm thinking about this a lot.
[02:04:34.305 --> 02:04:48.332]  I've got a I got a brother of a brother-in-law who he's a nurse and he he he ended up with he picked up the virus and was in the hospital for a couple days and he he decided to take the vaccine.
[02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:55.752]  I'm thinking down the road when he does develop problems, is there anything I can recommend?
[02:04:57.192 --> 02:05:04.656]  Just as I told you, I think steroids, you can prescribe them and get the higher doses.
[02:05:05.865 --> 02:05:10.387]  You know, you take it as an inhaled preparation, even over-the-counter.
[02:05:10.807 --> 02:05:12.067]  Well, sir, I'm no doctor.
[02:05:12.147 --> 02:05:17.989]  I've just read the literature that says a lot of the brain fog is caused by an autoimmune response and swelling in the brain.
[02:05:18.489 --> 02:05:23.531]  So it seems to be common sense then, if you take steroids to deal with swelling, that steroids might help.
[02:05:25.546 --> 02:05:25.986]  Exactly.
[02:05:26.547 --> 02:05:33.049]  And the steroids, like any other gas, can easily access your bloodstream through the lungs.
[02:05:33.149 --> 02:05:35.990]  You know, any marijuana smoker knows this.
[02:05:36.610 --> 02:05:38.731]  It's an easy way to get things into your bloodstream.
[02:05:39.231 --> 02:05:41.031]  It kind of bypasses some barriers.
[02:05:41.131 --> 02:05:43.092]  By the way, I recognize your voice.
[02:05:43.172 --> 02:05:43.812]  You're a doctor.
[02:05:43.832 --> 02:05:46.693]  You used to live in, like, Wyoming or Montana or something.
[02:05:47.254 --> 02:05:48.994]  You've been calling about 20 years, haven't you?
[02:05:49.954 --> 02:05:51.075]  Yeah, I have.
[02:05:51.795 --> 02:05:53.856]  You haven't gotten on in about 5, 6, 7 years, have you?
[02:05:55.798 --> 02:05:56.899]  It ain't so easy anymore.
[02:05:57.039 --> 02:05:59.460]  You're a victim of your own popularity, Alex.
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:01.801]  So, did you move to Texas, Mike?
[02:06:03.362 --> 02:06:05.282]  Yeah, my wife's got family here.
[02:06:05.743 --> 02:06:06.583]  God knows I wouldn't be here.
[02:06:06.603 --> 02:06:06.963]  I understand.
[02:06:07.143 --> 02:06:10.365]  Was it Montana or Wyoming you used to live in?
[02:06:10.585 --> 02:06:16.167]  I trained in Arizona, and we lived... I practiced in Wyoming for about 11 years.
[02:06:16.588 --> 02:06:17.068]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:06:17.108 --> 02:06:20.569]  You first called in 20 years ago from Arizona, and then you lived in Wyoming.
[02:06:20.609 --> 02:06:21.710]  See, I remember you, don't I?
[02:06:22.911 --> 02:06:24.994]  You sure do.
[02:06:25.975 --> 02:06:26.675]  You'll have memory.
[02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:46.030]  I don't know.
[02:06:46.071 --> 02:06:57.517]  These people are, the reckless behavior, the whole nature of this program, just double-make-care, who dies, who gets sick.
[02:06:57.998 --> 02:06:59.038]  Yeah, some people get sick.
[02:06:59.098 --> 02:07:00.039]  Yeah, we know that.
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:09.985]  That couldn't happen without the 86 Act, which stripped the liability concerns of the pharmaceutical companies.
[02:07:10.765 --> 02:07:12.506]  That needs to be rethought.
[02:07:13.427 --> 02:07:20.211]  These pharmaceutical companies, at the very least, need to be held liable for... Sure, and won't this discredit future legitimate gene therapies, what they're doing?
[02:07:22.573 --> 02:07:27.756]  Well, probably not, because they haven't even labeled it properly.
[02:07:27.796 --> 02:07:29.057]  They're calling it a vaccine.
[02:07:29.778 --> 02:07:36.642]  So when they do come out with, you know, real therapies, people will think it's the first thing on the market.
[02:07:36.742 --> 02:07:37.903]  You know, they've never seen it before.
[02:07:41.465 --> 02:07:41.965]  All right, brother.
[02:07:41.985 --> 02:07:46.329]  Well, I said I wanted to interview you 15 years ago as a guest, and like six, seven years ago, last time you got on.
[02:07:46.369 --> 02:07:51.272]  But join us as a guest for 10 minutes tomorrow when I host the show, if you can.
[02:07:51.292 --> 02:07:53.214]  I'm going to tape from noon to two.
[02:07:53.514 --> 02:07:55.716]  We're going to air it four to six tomorrow.
[02:07:55.936 --> 02:07:59.899]  But if you want to pop on for 10 minutes and give us your knowledge on this, we'd love to talk to you tomorrow.
[02:07:59.939 --> 02:08:00.219]  Thank you.
[02:08:00.699 --> 02:08:03.301]  Yeah, folks, I recognize our callers.
[02:08:06.127 --> 02:08:07.467]  A lot of the old original callers.
[02:08:07.487 --> 02:08:08.207]  We always had a lot of callers.
[02:08:08.227 --> 02:08:09.168]  The show's always been big.
[02:08:09.748 --> 02:08:12.749]  But, you know, now when we open the phones up, we have a computer in there.
[02:08:14.489 --> 02:08:19.070]  We have had 24,000 requests during one show before.
[02:08:19.090 --> 02:08:25.952]  Now, granted, that's some of the same people calling back in, but Rush Limbaugh, I talked to some of his people that work for him.
[02:08:26.392 --> 02:08:28.352]  Rush would get a couple thousand requests on his show.
[02:08:28.372 --> 02:08:29.292]  24,000 requests.
[02:08:33.424 --> 02:08:37.607]  That is, that's why Carlos has been calling in 15 years out of Canada.
[02:08:37.647 --> 02:08:40.288]  He's a big heavy hitter, big guy in government and everything.
[02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:43.290]  I don't know how, he must have that sucker on speed dial, man.
[02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:48.674]  Because he gets in routinely, but everybody else that used to get in, they can't get in, so I really miss talking to folks.
[02:08:48.974 --> 02:08:49.634]  Good talking to Mike.
[02:08:49.694 --> 02:08:51.275]  I want Mike on for 10 minutes as a guest tomorrow.
[02:08:51.836 --> 02:08:55.998]  And pick a few other of the callers, I'll tell you their names and numbers as kind of guest hosts.
[02:08:56.078 --> 02:08:58.540]  I'm going to definitely start doing that more as I said I would.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:00.041]  Always better late than never.
[02:09:01.448 --> 02:09:03.370]  Wow, hour number four straight ahead.
[02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:10.015]  I'm going to finish up with all these callers that are patiently holding, and then I'm going to shift gears into the designed destruction of the U.S.
[02:09:10.055 --> 02:09:14.558]  and Biden falling down, and the Chinese rebuking him as a weak nothing because they own him.
[02:09:14.938 --> 02:09:16.480]  I mean, it's just total humiliation.
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:19.762]  But don't let their humiliation work, and then it backfires.
[02:09:19.802 --> 02:09:21.864]  I'm going to talk about the PSYOP going on right now.
[02:09:21.884 --> 02:09:22.864]  They're trying to break our will.
[02:09:22.925 --> 02:09:23.685]  It's not going to happen.
[02:09:24.426 --> 02:09:25.747]  It's going to backfire on them.
[02:09:26.307 --> 02:09:28.129]  But these murderers can't help themselves.
[02:09:29.121 --> 02:09:33.562]  Yeah, that was a blast from the past talking to Mike Fallon, and he hadn't gotten it in six, seven years.
[02:09:34.643 --> 02:09:35.543]  I never forget, though.
[02:09:36.403 --> 02:09:37.804]  Somebody's got a distinctive voice.
[02:09:38.944 --> 02:09:45.686]  All right, we've got loaded phone lines here, and it's incredible taking your calls with the vaccines and all the knowledge that's coming out.
[02:09:47.647 --> 02:09:50.348]  But I do need to shift gears into the strategic plan to bring the U.S.
[02:09:50.388 --> 02:09:50.868]  down, because
[02:09:52.426 --> 02:09:54.767]  I don't say this with any enjoyment.
[02:09:55.527 --> 02:09:56.487]  I'm very upset about this.
[02:09:56.527 --> 02:09:58.528]  I love America because it's an idea.
[02:09:59.448 --> 02:09:59.948]  It's a dream.
[02:09:59.988 --> 02:10:01.209]  What we dream, we can manifest.
[02:10:02.129 --> 02:10:10.671]  But if you're not honest about how much trouble this country's in, how much trouble Texas is in, because I love Texas, and Texas is on its last legs right now.
[02:10:10.971 --> 02:10:12.632]  We can turn that around, but not much longer.
[02:10:13.860 --> 02:10:16.242]  And so, I'm going to tell it like it is coming up.
[02:10:17.083 --> 02:10:25.971]  And how emblematic it is, Biden falling down, not once, not twice, but three times, while shooting his mouth off about how he's going to kick everybody's ass and he's going to show the Russians and all the rest of it.
[02:10:26.231 --> 02:10:28.073]  Yeah, just like Napoleon and just like Hitler, right?
[02:10:28.113 --> 02:10:29.134]  You're going to show them now?
[02:10:29.154 --> 02:10:31.636]  It just never ends, man.
[02:10:33.397 --> 02:10:35.539]  But they were able to take the Russians over with a fake revolution.
[02:10:35.559 --> 02:10:36.861]  That's what they're trying to do to us right now.
[02:10:37.918 --> 02:10:43.180]  And so we should be rooting for the Russians and rooting for ourselves and rooting for the downfall of the left and their satanic garbage.
[02:10:43.841 --> 02:10:48.403]  But right now, let's go ahead and take another phone call.
[02:10:48.443 --> 02:10:49.884]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:10:51.144 --> 02:10:52.905]  That would be Granny Do-Right.
[02:10:53.025 --> 02:10:53.785]  Granny Do-Right.
[02:10:53.825 --> 02:10:54.966]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:10:55.006 --> 02:10:55.386]  Go ahead.
[02:10:56.887 --> 02:10:57.827]  Hi, Alex.
[02:10:58.247 --> 02:11:00.709]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[02:11:00.869 --> 02:11:01.509]  I am a granny.
[02:11:02.683 --> 02:11:13.510]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:22.055]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[02:11:22.415 --> 02:11:23.476]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[02:11:26.573 --> 02:11:30.256]  Well, let's take some time on this because I'm the worst at forgetting to take my supplements.
[02:11:30.956 --> 02:11:32.937]  And when I do take the fish oil, I do take the X2.
[02:11:32.977 --> 02:11:35.619]  My skin, my hair, my brain, everything is so much better.
[02:11:35.639 --> 02:11:39.021]  But Dr. Group, when he first said, you need medical grade iodine.
[02:11:39.342 --> 02:11:40.362]  We have a DEA license.
[02:11:40.382 --> 02:11:41.123]  Nobody else has it.
[02:11:41.183 --> 02:11:41.943]  I'm like, oh, yeah, right.
[02:11:42.063 --> 02:11:42.404]  Iodine.
[02:11:42.704 --> 02:11:44.045]  He said, no, no, no, not the stuff at the store.
[02:11:44.065 --> 02:11:44.625]  It'll kill you.
[02:11:44.965 --> 02:11:45.946]  This is real iodine.
[02:11:46.266 --> 02:11:49.088]  And I had these sunspots already because I'm a big outdoorsman.
[02:11:49.508 --> 02:11:51.370]  The sunspots went away.
[02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:55.052]  I still have a few freckles, but the sunspots went away within two months.
[02:11:55.272 --> 02:11:56.013]  So start over.
[02:11:56.033 --> 02:11:56.293]  Tell us why.
[02:11:56.493 --> 02:11:58.073]  What happened?
[02:11:58.714 --> 02:12:20.959]  Well, I just noticed that I had heard you talking, this was a few years back, to, I can't remember the doctor's name, and you were commenting on how his skin was flawless, that he was a real advocate for iodine, and not Dr. Group.
[02:12:21.039 --> 02:12:24.680]  I'm talking about an older gentleman, I think probably he was 75 at the time.
[02:12:26.718 --> 02:12:27.858]  That was Dr. Wallach.
[02:12:28.738 --> 02:12:29.019]  Yes.
[02:12:29.859 --> 02:12:30.159]  Yes.
[02:12:31.899 --> 02:12:34.900]  And so I thought, oh, I'm going to try it.
[02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:37.481]  Yeah, Wallach looked like when he was 79 years old, he looked like he was about 56.
[02:12:37.801 --> 02:12:38.441]  Yeah.
[02:12:39.201 --> 02:12:39.661]  Correct.
[02:12:40.521 --> 02:12:49.524]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[02:12:49.604 --> 02:12:55.545]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time,
[02:12:56.232 --> 02:12:56.813]  I don't know.
[02:13:13.257 --> 02:13:15.819]  Totally cleared up my skin, but I feel great.
[02:13:15.839 --> 02:13:17.200]  Well, I appreciate your testimony.
[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:18.141]  I don't want to cut you short.
[02:13:18.161 --> 02:13:18.881]  I want to put you on hold.
[02:13:18.921 --> 02:13:19.582]  Granny, do it right.
[02:13:19.862 --> 02:13:20.262]  One minute.
[02:13:20.282 --> 02:13:21.123]  Just wait one more minute.
[02:13:21.503 --> 02:13:22.484]  I'm going to, because some stations join us.
[02:13:22.504 --> 02:13:23.144]  We're going to come back.
[02:13:23.185 --> 02:13:25.386]  You can talk about family has taken the vaccines.
[02:13:25.406 --> 02:13:26.947]  Want to randomly hear what you have to say there.
[02:13:28.148 --> 02:13:32.211]  And then Nathan, let's talk about what happened to a family member and the side effects.
[02:13:32.852 --> 02:13:34.913]  And then we're going to talk to Josh, Steven, and Clarence.
[02:13:34.973 --> 02:13:36.194]  And then that's it for those calls.
[02:13:36.735 --> 02:13:37.896]  We're going to clear the board off.
[02:13:38.831 --> 02:13:45.233]  Man, I'm going to open the phones up, specifically in the time we have left, on what do you make of Joe Biden falling down three times?
[02:13:45.253 --> 02:13:46.673]  What do you make of him starting a fight with Russia?
[02:13:47.053 --> 02:13:47.513]  No U.S.
[02:13:47.553 --> 02:13:51.395]  President's like, they'll pay soon, they'll find out.
[02:13:51.875 --> 02:13:53.855]  He's a murderer.
[02:13:54.275 --> 02:13:56.076]  It's just crazy dementia.
[02:13:56.796 --> 02:14:01.437]  I've never heard of something in history where you've got some crazy, demented person.
[02:14:02.538 --> 02:14:04.318]  It's all just God cursing us.
[02:14:04.398 --> 02:14:06.279]  I mean, just give me a break, man.
[02:14:07.259 --> 02:14:09.001]  He should be in a nursing home in a wheelchair.
[02:14:10.143 --> 02:14:15.349]  We're now into hour number four on the program that's not supposed to exist, not supposed to be on air.
[02:14:15.730 --> 02:14:20.556]  The most censored, the most lied about, the most demonized broadcast in the world and I am blessed to be here.
[02:14:22.731 --> 02:14:27.534]  Yes, you know, we're talking about folks that take the supplements and then make them look younger, make them look healthy.
[02:14:27.554 --> 02:14:31.217]  People say, well, Jones, you look like you're about 55, not 47.
[02:14:31.277 --> 02:14:34.599]  Well, let me tell you, when I was 12, I was dating girls that were 16.
[02:14:34.639 --> 02:14:36.740]  When I was 16, I was dating 25-year-old women.
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:38.361]  I'm not bragging, it's just true.
[02:14:38.501 --> 02:14:42.044]  I was the guy they always sent to get beer because they'd sell me beer because I looked older.
[02:14:42.064 --> 02:14:43.284]  That's just the way I've always been.
[02:14:45.266 --> 02:14:51.690]  I mean, I was living like a man by the time I was 12, so who knows how long I'll be living, but I've been burning the candle at both ends from the start.
[02:14:52.773 --> 02:14:53.713]  And that's just the way it is.
[02:14:55.093 --> 02:15:01.115]  So, I wanted to drive cars, I wanted to date women, I wanted to kick ass, and that's just what I did.
[02:15:01.875 --> 02:15:03.515]  And here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:04.695 --> 02:15:07.816]  Here we are together in this fight, and I'm honored to be here.
[02:15:08.056 --> 02:15:13.197]  But Granny Do-Right in Kentucky, go ahead, you wanted to talk about your family's taking the vaccine, give us your take on it.
[02:15:15.258 --> 02:15:20.439]  Yeah, much to my... I don't even know what to say.
[02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:23.381]  My sister was the first one.
[02:15:23.401 --> 02:15:37.191]  I told them years ago, last year, sorry, when it first happened, I was like, yeah, and they'll come out with a vaccine to cure this, except it won't be a vaccine and it won't be anything you're going to want to take.
[02:15:37.392 --> 02:15:38.773]  And here we are a year later.
[02:15:38.793 --> 02:15:43.456]  And I had told my sister, you're not taking this, are you?
[02:15:43.476 --> 02:15:44.917]  She's like, oh, I'm not stupid.
[02:15:45.277 --> 02:15:46.038]  Of course I am.
[02:15:46.058 --> 02:15:48.500]  I'm like, what?
[02:15:49.651 --> 02:16:01.219]  And sent her information again, sent my brother-in-law, who almost, I guess, I really made him mad because he said, don't text me any more information.
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:11.787]  And my nieces and nephews, who I sent all the information to, I had one text me back, oh, I'm taking the J&J tomorrow.
[02:16:12.267 --> 02:16:13.849]  And I was like, well, yikes!
[02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:18.512]  Like, rethink that one and send them more information.
[02:16:19.705 --> 02:16:26.228]  I mean, I'm pulling my hair out because it's like it almost doesn't matter what you say, the information you send.
[02:16:26.268 --> 02:16:38.993]  My sister-in-law took hers, my other nephew took his, and it's gotten to the point where, like, I'm throwing my hands up in the air, like, what do I have to do to convince these people?
[02:16:39.073 --> 02:16:45.055]  They have been so thoroughly, thoroughly embedded and brainwashed in the system, it's just
[02:16:45.737 --> 02:16:46.638]  Unbelievable to me.
[02:16:46.658 --> 02:16:50.041]  Well, the good news is around half the public in polls say they're not taking it.
[02:16:50.701 --> 02:16:53.764]  And in certain families people are buying into the system and others are not.
[02:16:53.784 --> 02:16:56.566]  But they all do it because they want to be a hero and save others.
[02:16:56.766 --> 02:16:59.228]  So it's like something they can do as a rite of passage.
[02:16:59.268 --> 02:17:05.954]  They can go, these are big pharma with their history of secret experimentation and show them all the different scientists that have come out and said this is dangerous.
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:09.402]  And just do your job warning and then move on.
[02:17:09.462 --> 02:17:10.242]  God bless you, Granny.
[02:17:10.803 --> 02:17:11.683]  And that's all you can do.
[02:17:12.484 --> 02:17:16.827]  But I guarantee you, a lot of them are going to get sick down the road from this and they're going to remember.
[02:17:18.048 --> 02:17:23.831]  But the biggest group we know, just go off the British Ministry of Defense that's running the program, is above 75.
[02:17:23.952 --> 02:17:27.314]  Do not take the mRNA vaccine if you're above 75.
[02:17:27.354 --> 02:17:28.495]  If you're pregnant, don't take it.
[02:17:29.916 --> 02:17:30.956]  It's causing miscarriages.
[02:17:30.996 --> 02:17:33.178]  But, you know, I see these doctors.
[02:17:34.718 --> 02:17:36.898]  I've seen a couple of them that took the vaccine and lost their babies.
[02:17:37.479 --> 02:17:39.639]  They go, I'd do it again, it wasn't the vaccine.
[02:17:39.719 --> 02:17:42.360]  So they get into the sin.
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:43.960]  They get into hurting themselves.
[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:46.140]  They get into the Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:17:46.641 --> 02:17:50.261]  Because if they admit that they're being lied to, well, they've got to admit the whole system's a fraud.
[02:17:51.682 --> 02:17:54.222]  So they pretend like they're the establishment when they're not.
[02:17:55.703 --> 02:17:59.743]  But I'll tell you this, if you're above 75, run from the vaccine.
[02:17:59.783 --> 02:18:00.584]  I wouldn't take it, period.
[02:18:00.984 --> 02:18:01.884]  And man, if you're black,
[02:18:03.874 --> 02:18:07.776]  I love the headlines like, Black people don't trust it because they're uneducated, Biden said.
[02:18:07.796 --> 02:18:13.480]  No, I think they've been pretty educated by drugs being shipped in their neighborhoods and being given syphilis and the rest of it.
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:17.963]  I think, I think you little virtue signalers that tell blacks how much they love them all day.
[02:18:19.384 --> 02:18:20.444]  I just love you.
[02:18:20.985 --> 02:18:22.065]  Oh, you poor thing.
[02:18:22.325 --> 02:18:23.366]  I'm going to tell you how to live your life.
[02:18:23.606 --> 02:18:25.047]  And I got a shot for you.
[02:18:25.087 --> 02:18:25.768]  Bill Gates does.
[02:18:26.208 --> 02:18:30.190]  Meanwhile, he's in articles 10 years ago saying we need to depopulate Africa.
[02:18:30.671 --> 02:18:32.512]  He wants to depopulate black people.
[02:18:33.884 --> 02:18:35.365]  Oh, but he loves you.
[02:18:35.385 --> 02:18:37.467]  I mean, that's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:18:39.489 --> 02:18:41.690]  But see, wanting to depopulate blacks is loving.
[02:18:44.192 --> 02:18:45.693]  But a microaggression is bad.
[02:18:48.255 --> 02:18:48.756]  Unbelievable.
[02:18:49.616 --> 02:18:51.258]  All right, let's go to the next caller here.
[02:18:52.418 --> 02:18:55.581]  Let's talk to Nathan in Canada.
[02:18:55.661 --> 02:18:56.381]  Thank you for holding.
[02:18:56.401 --> 02:18:56.742]  Go ahead.
[02:18:56.762 --> 02:18:58.923]  Hello.
[02:18:59.304 --> 02:18:59.544]  Yes, sir.
[02:19:00.478 --> 02:19:05.882]  Hey Alex, I'm a first-time caller calling from Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.
[02:19:07.463 --> 02:19:16.770]  My uncle's sister and her husband went and got the vaccine probably about two or three days ago and they've started getting symptoms.
[02:19:16.810 --> 02:19:18.551]  They say that's like worse than
[02:19:19.721 --> 02:19:21.562]  Like the regular seasonal flu.
[02:19:21.602 --> 02:19:25.703]  They've been vomiting a couple times.
[02:19:25.783 --> 02:19:29.324]  They've just been feeling really poor.
[02:19:29.364 --> 02:19:31.604]  They're all over the place.
[02:19:32.325 --> 02:19:34.085]  It's not looking really good.
[02:19:34.185 --> 02:19:48.189]  And on top of that, one of my aunts has Hodgkin's lymphoma of the lungs, cancer of the lungs, and she's in the hospital and they're trying to force the vaccine on her, which
[02:19:50.421 --> 02:19:56.985]  Oh, they admit if you have cancer, don't take it, because it can inflame the cancer.
[02:19:57.105 --> 02:19:57.545]  Wow!
[02:19:57.805 --> 02:19:59.166]  But notice they just still push it.
[02:19:59.206 --> 02:20:00.127]  That is insane.
[02:20:00.627 --> 02:20:01.948]  Wow, so they're trying to kill her, huh?
[02:20:02.588 --> 02:20:04.830]  Well, these hospitals have become death factories, brother.
[02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:06.311]  What should we do, Nathan?
[02:20:19.477 --> 02:20:19.957]  I agree with you.
[02:20:19.977 --> 02:20:21.818]  I want everybody to know, Nathan, what you held to do.
[02:20:21.858 --> 02:20:22.299]  We love you.
[02:20:22.319 --> 02:20:23.459]  Your phone cut out there.
[02:20:23.479 --> 02:20:27.342]  All right, let's talk to Active Duty Army on COVID vaccines.
[02:20:27.602 --> 02:20:28.402]  Mandatory soon.
[02:20:28.422 --> 02:20:30.284]  That's what a caller said yesterday.
[02:20:30.304 --> 02:20:34.206]  I made some calls, and yeah, the military is being told mandatory by late summer.
[02:20:34.966 --> 02:20:38.989]  Let's go ahead and go to Steven in Washington State.
[02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:41.330]  Active Duty Army, give us your take on this, please.
[02:20:42.531 --> 02:20:44.552]  Alex, first-time caller, long-time listener.
[02:20:44.592 --> 02:20:45.153]  So I'm up here.
[02:20:45.173 --> 02:20:47.414]  I'm Active Duty in Washington, and at my unit,
[02:20:48.686 --> 02:20:53.977]  They are pushing it so hard like a sales pitch and there are a lot of guys that don't want to take it but there are those that do.
[02:20:53.997 --> 02:20:59.709]  So I'm just curious as to what are they going to do when July rolls around and
[02:21:00.632 --> 02:21:01.172]  They say no.
[02:21:01.673 --> 02:21:02.434]  I don't want to take this.
[02:21:02.494 --> 02:21:04.415]  Are they going to face UCMJ action?
[02:21:04.475 --> 02:21:06.257]  Are they going to be... Well, they've got to call their bluff.
[02:21:06.277 --> 02:21:10.360]  Because, I mean, we had Dr. Francis Boyle on, who we should get on for a whole hour just about refusing.
[02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:11.741]  He tried to make the hour about that.
[02:21:11.761 --> 02:21:12.442]  I should have let him do it.
[02:21:12.922 --> 02:21:22.790]  But he twice, when they did the illegal experimental anthrax shot that killed over 10,000 just in one round, I think 20,000 the next round, he got that suspended twice.
[02:21:23.231 --> 02:21:25.172]  And so that's why they're like, oh, it's voluntary.
[02:21:25.192 --> 02:21:26.513]  And then later, oh, it's mandatory.
[02:21:26.954 --> 02:21:28.175]  You've just got to say, listen,
[02:21:29.502 --> 02:21:31.204]  I know the officer class isn't taking it.
[02:21:31.604 --> 02:21:32.445]  It's experimental.
[02:21:33.006 --> 02:21:33.466]  I'm young.
[02:21:33.546 --> 02:21:34.107]  I'm not sick.
[02:21:34.187 --> 02:21:34.888]  I'm not taking it.
[02:21:34.928 --> 02:21:35.909]  I'm not being belligerent.
[02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:45.439]  And if you want to, you know, I'd rather be dishonorably discharged than have a permanent, you know, medical disorder because we're going to have to say no at some point.
[02:21:45.999 --> 02:21:47.540]  I mean, it's not like the tyranny's coming.
[02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:48.341]  It's here now, brother.
[02:21:48.661 --> 02:21:51.583]  It'll be Civil War starvation in two years if this keeps happening.
[02:21:51.863 --> 02:21:53.444]  This is the takedown of the West, brother.
[02:21:53.744 --> 02:21:55.245]  So we all just have to get ready for that.
[02:21:55.285 --> 02:21:56.586]  I told my wife she agrees with me.
[02:21:57.027 --> 02:21:58.107]  My family agrees.
[02:21:58.187 --> 02:22:00.749]  I met with the former head of the Major Intelligence Agency.
[02:22:00.789 --> 02:22:01.350]  He agreed with me.
[02:22:01.650 --> 02:22:02.530]  There's no U.S.
[02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:03.331]  in two years, brother.
[02:22:03.751 --> 02:22:05.973]  I mean, I'm telling you, we went over the cliff.
[02:22:06.273 --> 02:22:07.134]  And I'm not being negative.
[02:22:07.154 --> 02:22:07.794]  I'm just being honest.
[02:22:08.354 --> 02:22:09.695]  It's all over now, folks.
[02:22:09.735 --> 02:22:10.316]  It's all over.
[02:22:10.836 --> 02:22:13.140]  And so we just have to admit we're under bio-attack.
[02:22:13.541 --> 02:22:15.123]  Of course it's being rolled out by the UN.
[02:22:15.444 --> 02:22:16.746]  This is how they take down America.
[02:22:16.966 --> 02:22:18.408]  They would never do this with a frontal assault.
[02:22:20.382 --> 02:22:28.726]  No, and simultaneously, our adversaries are doing masculinity camps and training while over here, it's woke warfare.
[02:22:28.766 --> 02:22:29.166]  Exactly.
[02:22:29.206 --> 02:22:35.829]  In China, they are about total bravado, total machismo, savage male energy, which they had a problem with.
[02:22:35.849 --> 02:22:36.669]  They're now getting it again.
[02:22:38.090 --> 02:22:45.373]  The Russians are shooting live ammo into each other with body armor at point-blank range and masculine test, and we're learning how to wear red high-heeled shoes.
[02:22:46.234 --> 02:22:47.474]  And clear coat nail polish.
[02:22:47.554 --> 02:22:48.795]  It's absolutely nuts.
[02:22:49.721 --> 02:22:51.322]  Yeah, I talked to a Green Beret.
[02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:57.847]  They were sent up to the West Coast just a month ago to put nail polish on each other.
[02:23:00.048 --> 02:23:01.850]  Makeup and studs and everything else.
[02:23:02.825 --> 02:23:06.047]  It's the whittling away of everything that makes this.
[02:23:06.087 --> 02:23:08.209]  Look, it's a psy-op to run you out of the military.
[02:23:08.689 --> 02:23:18.997]  So all it is, the officer closes the door, nobody does what they say, you don't take the shots, this is a criminal government, just stop complying with the globalists, you are cells of patriots within what's left of the republic.
[02:23:19.237 --> 02:23:20.818]  Don't follow any of this garbage.
[02:23:20.838 --> 02:23:21.819]  Does that make sense?
[02:23:22.879 --> 02:23:23.400]  Beautiful.
[02:23:24.541 --> 02:23:25.201]  Anything else, brother?
[02:23:26.770 --> 02:23:27.891]  Shoot, have a good weekend, man.
[02:23:27.931 --> 02:23:28.952]  It's beer time over here.
[02:23:28.972 --> 02:23:29.872]  All right, brother.
[02:23:29.912 --> 02:23:31.193]  Thank you for holding to talk about that.
[02:23:31.674 --> 02:23:33.335]  All right, more calls straight ahead.
[02:23:33.475 --> 02:23:34.816]  Josh, Clarence, and Larry.
[02:23:35.036 --> 02:23:36.698]  Then I'm hitting the other big news straight ahead.
[02:23:37.238 --> 02:23:38.739]  Fix bayonets, my friends.
[02:23:38.799 --> 02:23:41.781]  We are now 20 minutes into hour number four.
[02:23:42.782 --> 02:23:44.423]  You know, there's not just evil in the universe.
[02:23:44.443 --> 02:23:44.964]  There's good.
[02:23:45.524 --> 02:23:52.690]  And all of you that are tuned in that care and want to be good, no matter what color you are, you got a spirit God gave you, and you want justice.
[02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:53.891]  We're brothers and sisters together.
[02:23:54.844 --> 02:23:55.905]  I knew all this was going to happen.
[02:23:55.925 --> 02:23:56.965]  I knew it was all going to come true.
[02:23:56.985 --> 02:23:59.407]  Because I'd seen everything else the New World Order had done before.
[02:24:00.227 --> 02:24:00.927]  But now we're here.
[02:24:00.947 --> 02:24:03.609]  And now it's an amazing time to be alive.
[02:24:03.649 --> 02:24:10.172]  I'm going to get into the Russians and the Chinese and how this has escalated to a whole new level that's so massive.
[02:24:10.192 --> 02:24:12.153]  I don't even have words to describe it.
[02:24:12.173 --> 02:24:15.635]  But I want to get to three more callers, Josh, Clarence, and Larry in the time we have in this segment.
[02:24:15.915 --> 02:24:16.816]  But let me just say something.
[02:24:19.107 --> 02:24:25.293]  You heard that guy obviously in the military and he was probably in special forces because the regular military is not being told to do this.
[02:24:26.294 --> 02:24:30.818]  And I didn't even want to say on air what I was told they were doing up in Idaho a month ago.
[02:24:31.379 --> 02:24:33.160]  But they're not just wearing red high heels.
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:38.225]  They order them at the sensitivity training to dress as women and put makeup on each other.
[02:24:38.605 --> 02:24:40.147]  And it's meant to run people out of the military.
[02:24:41.585 --> 02:24:43.006]  And you shouldn't even follow those orders.
[02:24:43.046 --> 02:24:44.126]  That's unconstitutional.
[02:24:44.186 --> 02:24:44.887]  It's garbage.
[02:24:44.927 --> 02:24:52.070]  But that's what the sick brass is doing while the Chinese literally run and pole vault into third-story buildings with their troops.
[02:24:53.111 --> 02:24:54.131]  And they're doing live fire.
[02:24:54.171 --> 02:24:55.492]  They're killing troops in training.
[02:24:55.552 --> 02:24:56.813]  I mean, it's what the Marines used to do.
[02:24:57.824 --> 02:24:58.944]  Before they got rid of it in the 80s.
[02:24:58.984 --> 02:25:00.905]  And the Marines used to kill somebody in every class.
[02:25:00.945 --> 02:25:01.825]  It was like what you did.
[02:25:01.925 --> 02:25:04.326]  You just kill somebody, dies in every class, maybe two or three.
[02:25:04.786 --> 02:25:05.786]  They'd kill people on purpose.
[02:25:06.186 --> 02:25:08.847]  Just to see what the, like somebody's a weirdo, full of crap.
[02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:15.409]  They'll decide we're gonna kill this guy on a training exercise to create, and I'm not even saying that's good, but that's a real cult, okay?
[02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:19.470]  The Chinese are killing people on their training exercises on purpose.
[02:25:19.951 --> 02:25:20.711]  We're not doing that anymore.
[02:25:21.851 --> 02:25:23.752]  That's all Hessian, by the way, training.
[02:25:25.213 --> 02:25:26.653]  It's brought over here during the Revolutionary War.
[02:25:27.193 --> 02:25:31.174]  So, that's what we've been turned into, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:31.934 --> 02:25:33.574]  Because you've got to get used to somebody dying in training.
[02:25:33.614 --> 02:25:34.515]  You've got to get used to somebody.
[02:25:35.215 --> 02:25:38.235]  You just kind of shake them off that rope and drop them down and everybody keeps their mouth shut.
[02:25:38.695 --> 02:25:39.495]  Now, is that good?
[02:25:39.615 --> 02:25:39.836]  No.
[02:25:40.296 --> 02:25:43.316]  But now we're wearing red high heels and learning how to give blowjobs.
[02:25:44.336 --> 02:25:47.137]  And that's what the military has turned into, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:48.357 --> 02:25:50.057]  And that's how they don't respect us.
[02:25:50.077 --> 02:25:51.738]  That's why the globalists have done this to us.
[02:25:52.598 --> 02:25:53.818]  I'm going to tell you again, the Russians
[02:25:55.987 --> 02:26:14.406]  One of their basic special forces classes is, at the lower level, just in the classes before you even make it is, you've got to do it dozens of times where at point-blank range with a low-caliber handgun, you draw your firearms about 10 feet apart and shoot each other in the chest, just to get used to the danger of firearms, the danger of that.
[02:26:14.707 --> 02:26:15.267]  And aren't U.S.
[02:26:15.287 --> 02:26:17.530]  militaries used to that, where they would make people in sniper training
[02:26:18.795 --> 02:26:22.817]  Sit there with a target at 500 yards right by somebody's head and take the shots.
[02:26:23.117 --> 02:26:24.258]  Well, everybody's wimps now.
[02:26:24.318 --> 02:26:24.918]  You don't do that.
[02:26:25.118 --> 02:26:27.299]  You say, well, that's extreme masculine macho stuff.
[02:26:27.619 --> 02:26:29.540]  Okay, well, now you wear high heels.
[02:26:32.141 --> 02:26:33.202]  Now they put on dresses.
[02:26:34.722 --> 02:26:35.282]  And so you heard him.
[02:26:35.303 --> 02:26:37.564]  He's like, yeah, we're not just putting makeup on.
[02:26:37.584 --> 02:26:39.164]  We're putting nipple bobbers on.
[02:26:39.184 --> 02:26:42.286]  I mean, it's all to humiliate and demoralize us.
[02:26:42.546 --> 02:26:45.007]  And we have to, at a certain point, stop saying yes to all this crap.
[02:26:47.523 --> 02:26:49.985]  And yes, I didn't know what nipple bobbers were until I looked it up.
[02:26:50.485 --> 02:26:57.229]  They make the troops put pincher things on their... Let's just... It's all... And you put up with it!
[02:26:57.249 --> 02:26:58.310]  We already kill our babies!
[02:26:58.350 --> 02:26:58.830]  Why not?
[02:26:58.870 --> 02:27:00.772]  I mean, we already kill babies after they're born.
[02:27:00.792 --> 02:27:01.252]  Why not?
[02:27:01.272 --> 02:27:02.753]  This is all the joke.
[02:27:04.074 --> 02:27:05.515]  Okay, Josh in Colorado.
[02:27:06.335 --> 02:27:06.936]  Thanks for holding.
[02:27:06.956 --> 02:27:08.617]  Go ahead, military friend on vaccine.
[02:27:09.177 --> 02:27:09.838]  And your take on it.
[02:27:09.858 --> 02:27:10.138]  Go ahead.
[02:27:11.172 --> 02:27:11.832]  Hey, Alex.
[02:27:12.333 --> 02:27:16.435]  So I recently just got out of the military and I have some buddies still in.
[02:27:16.655 --> 02:27:28.582]  And so we as like single soldiers in the military, we have like dining facilities that we can eat at that were like meant for, you know, just so we can eat chow and stuff.
[02:27:28.782 --> 02:27:36.907]  And the military started to implement to where if you are a, if you're vaccinated, then they're going to open a separate facility for you.
[02:27:36.927 --> 02:27:37.988]  So you don't have to wear a mask.
[02:27:38.706 --> 02:27:40.366]  And they're also doing this with gyms, too.
[02:27:40.446 --> 02:27:42.627]  So I just thought that was kind of crazy.
[02:27:42.647 --> 02:27:42.907]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:42.927 --> 02:27:44.107]  It's all social engineering.
[02:27:44.127 --> 02:27:47.988]  You're going to be first class citizen if you've got your vaccine.
[02:27:48.849 --> 02:27:51.769]  And so we all, again, don't wear the mask, don't do any of it.
[02:27:51.989 --> 02:27:53.630]  But the military is a captured group.
[02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:54.190]  They control.
[02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.650]  Continue.
[02:27:55.470 --> 02:27:55.770]  Oh, yes.
[02:27:55.810 --> 02:27:56.951]  No, I totally agree.
[02:27:57.491 --> 02:28:06.333]  When I was in, you know, the military's gotten so soft, you know, and I hate to say this, but, you know, if we got into a war with China or Russia, we would get our ass kicked.
[02:28:07.535 --> 02:28:15.743]  Just from seeing what, when I was in, it's gone so soft in SJW and it's sad seeing what's happened to our military.
[02:28:15.763 --> 02:28:23.970]  Well the Chinese don't disregard human lives so, and that, but the Russians are absolutely trained to the opposite of what we've been trained in.
[02:28:24.331 --> 02:28:28.435]  I mean it is like we have literally turned our military into just basically a gay orgy.
[02:28:30.067 --> 02:28:44.334]  It does seem like the progression of going down from being so awesome and cool during World War II, Vietnam War time frame to where it's at now where it's not even really worth joining no more.
[02:28:45.655 --> 02:28:46.355]  It's a joke.
[02:28:46.655 --> 02:28:47.236]  It's a joke.
[02:29:06.986 --> 02:29:07.206]  Right.
[02:29:07.266 --> 02:29:15.889]  No, and then also, too, when I was in, also, before I got out, they were saying that all the stuff that's being spread about the vaccines is misinformation to harm the U.S.
[02:29:15.929 --> 02:29:24.511]  economy and stuff, and that Bill Gates is really behind it and all of that, which I thought was pretty crazy because I was like, there's literally articles online contradicting what they say.
[02:29:25.011 --> 02:29:29.132]  So that's why I got out, because I was just tired of the whole S.H.A.W.
[02:29:29.332 --> 02:29:32.593]  mode and the vaccines and the COVID bullcrap, so.
[02:29:33.213 --> 02:29:34.314]  Well, here's what I've experienced.
[02:29:35.347 --> 02:29:37.469]  Their attempts to sell this backfire.
[02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:39.611]  And so I'm not blaming you yet now.
[02:29:39.651 --> 02:29:43.514]  I would not join the military because of the vaccines, what they do to you, but I respect those that are there.
[02:29:44.034 --> 02:29:44.755]  So it's a catch-22.
[02:29:44.775 --> 02:29:45.996]  Do you get everybody that's good out?
[02:29:46.757 --> 02:29:47.818]  And then it's only bad people?
[02:29:49.279 --> 02:29:53.582]  Or do you stay in there and just be a mole?
[02:29:56.112 --> 02:29:56.793]  No, yeah, right.
[02:29:56.833 --> 02:30:01.496]  And that military is also being used as political pawns, like, for the Democratic Party.
[02:30:01.516 --> 02:30:04.919]  My mom said, she was like, exactly what Hitler did during World War II.
[02:30:05.219 --> 02:30:09.082]  They would purge the military and then keep all the corrupt people in.
[02:30:09.182 --> 02:30:10.023]  Absolutely.
[02:30:10.063 --> 02:30:11.404]  They go, oh, the risk of misinformation.
[02:30:11.644 --> 02:30:16.187]  They admit it's untested, it's secret, it's got major health problems, it's being banned all over the world.
[02:30:16.428 --> 02:30:18.189]  And they gaslight and go, misinformation!
[02:30:18.229 --> 02:30:18.950]  Everything's fine!
[02:30:19.230 --> 02:30:19.930]  No, it's not!
[02:30:19.950 --> 02:30:22.913]  Alright, thank you, Josh.
[02:30:22.973 --> 02:30:25.054]  Alright, let's go to Clarence in Louisiana, then Larry.
[02:30:25.074 --> 02:30:25.635]  Go ahead, Clarence.
[02:30:26.977 --> 02:30:28.057]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:30:28.518 --> 02:30:32.959]  Um, we seem to be a lot of us facing where people don't listen and heed the warnings.
[02:30:33.679 --> 02:30:43.323]  I work in the maritime industry transporting, you know, river pilots that escort ships and not many, but a few, uh, keep asking me.
[02:30:43.383 --> 02:30:45.303]  And I said, no, I'm not taking the vaccine.
[02:30:45.904 --> 02:30:55.807]  You know, Mr. Jones, I've been going over this, everything from the America's frontline doctors to Dr. Judy Mikovits and Mrs. Karen Walker, Mrs. Celeste Solem.
[02:30:56.565 --> 02:31:00.286]  And it seems like maybe they just blew off the conversation.
[02:31:00.426 --> 02:31:00.866]  I don't know.
[02:31:00.886 --> 02:31:04.727]  I mean, I agree with you.
[02:31:05.067 --> 02:31:07.168]  What do you think people are going to do as the death toll mounts?
[02:31:09.328 --> 02:31:10.068]  It's unfortunate.
[02:31:10.149 --> 02:31:12.549]  It seems like they've learned the hard way.
[02:31:12.589 --> 02:31:13.209]  They don't mean to harm.
[02:31:13.269 --> 02:31:15.730]  I don't think nobody would want their family or others to die.
[02:31:15.750 --> 02:31:20.211]  But once you really start seeing things for what they are, it's like any of us.
[02:31:20.351 --> 02:31:23.592]  Once I got into the Marine Corps, it was a totally different thing carrying a pack
[02:31:24.306 --> 02:31:27.208]  And hauling up mountains and playing war as a kid.
[02:31:29.290 --> 02:31:35.394]  The bedenicide, the silver bullet, the doctor, Dr. Bartlett there in Texas, he got that to help with swelling.
[02:31:35.834 --> 02:31:38.476]  The Benadryl, I would advise some aspirin.
[02:31:38.976 --> 02:31:41.198]  And Tericotin, people worried about their tummy.
[02:31:42.719 --> 02:31:53.026]  I had a firefighter friend, because back when I was in EMS, and then later in behavioral health, you didn't get the flu shot, you didn't have a job.
[02:31:53.965 --> 02:32:03.450]  In the last four or five years, I myself may have suffered some effects of walking, and so by the grace of God, I think I'm doing well.
[02:32:03.490 --> 02:32:04.170]  I'm still ambulatory.
[02:32:04.210 --> 02:32:05.431]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[02:32:05.471 --> 02:32:06.511]  Thank you, Clarence, for holding.
[02:32:06.531 --> 02:32:07.172]  We'll be right back.
[02:32:07.192 --> 02:32:07.612]  Stay with us.
[02:32:08.552 --> 02:32:11.154]  It's 2.33 Central Standard Time, and we're live.
[02:32:11.614 --> 02:32:13.535]  We'll be restreaming the show until 4 p.m.
[02:32:13.575 --> 02:32:15.976]  tomorrow when we got another original transmission.
[02:32:16.016 --> 02:32:17.777]  I'm coming in to tape tomorrow afternoon.
[02:32:19.022 --> 02:32:21.183]  From two to four or noon to two.
[02:32:21.203 --> 02:32:23.745]  Then we're going to doll it up a little bit with documents and clips.
[02:32:23.825 --> 02:32:25.046]  I'm going to air it at 4 p.m.
[02:32:25.546 --> 02:32:27.407]  Central Standard Time tomorrow.
[02:32:28.248 --> 02:32:30.849]  The most banned demonized attack broadcast in the world.
[02:32:33.191 --> 02:32:34.211]  So let's hit this right now.
[02:32:34.231 --> 02:32:37.133]  If you're a TV viewer, you'll be able to see this.
[02:32:37.193 --> 02:32:39.194]  Radio listeners, we're going to post this to InfoWars.com.
[02:32:39.234 --> 02:32:40.615]  There's also live streams right now.
[02:32:40.655 --> 02:32:41.776]  But this really tells all.
[02:32:42.296 --> 02:32:45.118]  Biden's going on to Air Force One.
[02:32:46.519 --> 02:32:49.039]  And he falls down not once, not twice, but three times.
[02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:54.420]  And then does this whole fake confidence thing with his shoulders like he's a tough guy up at the top.
[02:32:56.861 --> 02:32:58.261]  And then salutes the troops.
[02:32:59.521 --> 02:33:06.162]  This is the guy that just threatened that he's going to, quote, attack Russia, that Russia's in deep trouble, that they're about to find out what he's going to do.
[02:33:06.863 --> 02:33:07.483]  No, no U.S.
[02:33:07.503 --> 02:33:08.583]  president ever talked like that.
[02:33:10.183 --> 02:33:12.443]  And that sounds like Kim Jong-il.
[02:33:12.463 --> 02:33:12.824]  Kim Jong-un.
[02:33:18.952 --> 02:33:28.723]  The Chinese, while he was falling down, it turns out, getting on Air Force One, were up in Alaska meeting with Tony Blinken, a little New World Order anti-American U.S.
[02:33:28.783 --> 02:33:32.448]  envoy to China, and they were just laughing at him with total disdain.
[02:33:32.888 --> 02:33:35.551]  Never seen the Chinese act like this to U.S.
[02:33:35.591 --> 02:33:36.452]  presidents or U.S.
[02:33:36.532 --> 02:33:36.873]  envoys.
[02:33:38.814 --> 02:33:39.855]  But there was a disdain.
[02:33:39.895 --> 02:33:41.076]  They know he wasn't elected.
[02:33:41.116 --> 02:33:42.217]  They know he's a fraud.
[02:33:42.257 --> 02:33:43.738]  They know they're a bunch of cowardly lawyers.
[02:33:44.078 --> 02:33:49.523]  And they know that almost all the Democrats are on their payroll, so they were talking to their subordinates.
[02:33:51.344 --> 02:33:52.685]  You know, Japan's the same way.
[02:33:53.406 --> 02:34:02.533]  We dropped atomic bombs on them, and they worshipped us legitimately and thought we were God and wanted to start worshipping the U.S.
[02:34:02.573 --> 02:34:03.014]  President.
[02:34:05.865 --> 02:34:16.589]  Harry Truman as their emperor, and then when he wouldn't do it, Douglas MacArthur was there, and they tried to treat him the same way, but he ended all of that.
[02:34:17.930 --> 02:34:19.430]  But the Japanese, it was all about might.
[02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:21.391]  If we beat their ass, we were God.
[02:34:22.792 --> 02:34:24.192]  That's how it is over in Asia.
[02:34:26.813 --> 02:34:29.314]  They don't care if we got a blue-haired woman with a mask on.
[02:34:29.354 --> 02:34:30.935]  They don't care if we got a pink-haired woman.
[02:34:31.295 --> 02:34:33.656]  They don't care if we got a, you know, trendy dude.
[02:34:35.765 --> 02:34:40.929]  The fact that they own them and they're on their payroll is they have disrespect for them.
[02:34:43.230 --> 02:34:48.994]  They've been busy beating up Americans and manipulating Americans, the left has, and now they're a big joke.
[02:34:49.275 --> 02:35:00.262]  Doesn't matter if they're senile, addled, brain-dead Biden, goes and does a Stephanopoulos interview and shoots his mouth off about how he's God and all this, or does another interview with Chuck Todd and says the same thing.
[02:35:00.923 --> 02:35:03.565]  In the real world, that's not what leaders act like.
[02:35:04.986 --> 02:35:14.888]  So Biden says all this and Putin goes, oh, I care about your health, meaning obviously you're falling apart, and I challenge you to do a debate.
[02:35:14.908 --> 02:35:22.229]  But if you talk about a killer, Putin's the one ending wars, you're the one starting wars.
[02:35:22.249 --> 02:35:23.370]  He said, you ought to look in the mirror.
[02:35:25.690 --> 02:35:29.991]  So soulless Putin challenges killer Biden to live debate.
[02:35:30.939 --> 02:35:39.601]  So let's roll the video of Biden talking about how the Russians are about to find out and about to pay, and a lot of other... He should have just said that.
[02:35:39.621 --> 02:35:41.542]  If he'd have said that, they might have taken respect.
[02:35:41.782 --> 02:35:43.082]  But then he kissed their ass after.
[02:35:43.923 --> 02:35:46.663]  If you're going to like... I'm going to destroy you, you're about to find out.
[02:35:46.863 --> 02:35:47.964]  But by the way, I really want to work with you.
[02:35:47.984 --> 02:35:48.844]  That's not how you do it.
[02:35:50.123 --> 02:35:57.065]  So Putin calls Biden's bluff, challenges him to televise live debate, and he said, oh, he's too busy playing Mario Kart.
[02:35:57.565 --> 02:35:58.126]  He can't do it.
[02:35:58.226 --> 02:35:58.846]  How shameful.
[02:35:59.086 --> 02:35:59.986]  He starts the fight.
[02:36:00.266 --> 02:36:01.247]  He runs his mouth.
[02:36:02.087 --> 02:36:06.728]  And now he can't even walk up a flight of stairs because he's too busy acting like he's Superman.
[02:36:07.409 --> 02:36:11.790]  So let's let's let's roll that video with the slowdown footage of Biden falling down.
[02:36:13.447 --> 02:36:14.588]  What price must he pay?
[02:36:15.328 --> 02:36:17.230]  You said you know he doesn't have a soul.
[02:36:44.448 --> 02:36:47.451]  The press always asks me, don't I wish I were debating him?
[02:36:48.032 --> 02:36:50.535]  No, I wish were in high school I could take him behind the gym.
[02:36:50.555 --> 02:36:52.076]  That's what I wish.
[02:36:53.878 --> 02:36:55.240]  Why the hell would I take a test?
[02:36:56.842 --> 02:36:57.622]  Come on, man.
[02:36:57.643 --> 02:37:02.828]  That's like saying you, before you got in this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not.
[02:37:02.848 --> 02:37:03.469]  What do you think, huh?
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:19.453]  I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical as well as my mental fitness and to make a judgment about who I am.
[02:37:20.634 --> 02:37:27.140]  Now when President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in Arizona not long ago.
[02:37:29.136 --> 02:37:42.682]  So, no amount of internet censorship at Google or Facebook or Twitter can clean up the fact that we have a 79-year-old person with Alzheimer's and dementia as the President of the United States.
[02:37:44.123 --> 02:37:50.366]  And no amount of looking back at Trump and his mistakes will change that either, as they have the controlled right-wing opposition bashing Trump all day.
[02:37:50.626 --> 02:37:52.507]  I'll bash Trump, he deserves it, but I'm not against Trump.
[02:37:53.717 --> 02:37:54.838]  No, that's the puppet now.
[02:37:54.898 --> 02:37:55.699]  It's about him.
[02:37:56.060 --> 02:37:56.921]  It's about Joe Biden.
[02:37:57.621 --> 02:37:59.203]  You don't have Trump to kick around anymore.
[02:37:59.223 --> 02:38:00.244]  And I've got my issues with Trump.
[02:38:01.245 --> 02:38:02.587]  It's all about Joe Biden now.
[02:38:05.370 --> 02:38:13.819]  And so let's go ahead and play the clip from Alaska yesterday with Tony Blinken, the envoy to China.
[02:38:14.901 --> 02:38:20.845]  And if you're a radio listener, you're going to miss out on this, but the Chinese, I've studied their body language, is usually very friendly, very fawning.
[02:38:21.605 --> 02:38:23.767]  This was extremely confrontational.
[02:38:23.787 --> 02:38:28.690]  And they were looking at Blinken like he was a sack of manure they owned, which he is.
[02:38:30.287 --> 02:38:35.968]  And so see now, oh, you're puppets of the Chinese and the globalists, and now you ran America to the ground, and now you're cutting our power off.
[02:38:36.449 --> 02:38:38.589]  You're not so powerful, are you, selling your country out?
[02:38:38.809 --> 02:38:41.450]  You could have been the president like Trump and run the superpower.
[02:38:41.690 --> 02:38:47.751]  But instead, oh, you're in the cult of sell America out because all of you got where you are because you're puppets and it's all you know.
[02:38:47.991 --> 02:38:52.072]  But now you're in power, and you're learning the system doesn't respect you at that level.
[02:38:52.533 --> 02:38:57.774]  Because you climbed all the way up to the top, and now you're just selling out your superpower status for no reason.
[02:38:58.953 --> 02:39:01.515]  Because of your leftist little dick syndrome.
[02:39:03.496 --> 02:39:05.918]  America, you could mount its head on the wall.
[02:39:06.218 --> 02:39:12.642]  In fact, when Clinton first got inaugurated, Ron Silver, the Hollywood director, was in the news, was there, and he goes, they've got jets trying to attack us.
[02:39:12.662 --> 02:39:15.444]  That's how dumb and weird leftists are in their inferiority complex.
[02:39:15.464 --> 02:39:18.025]  They go, it's okay, Ron, those are our jets now.
[02:39:18.045 --> 02:39:19.026]  He goes, they're ours?
[02:39:19.706 --> 02:39:20.367]  They're ours!
[02:39:21.027 --> 02:39:22.788]  Let's use the military on the gun owners!
[02:39:23.009 --> 02:39:24.870]  Let's nuke them like Swallowswell says!
[02:39:27.281 --> 02:39:28.962]  These people all are trust fund kids.
[02:39:29.563 --> 02:39:34.807]  They all come out of weird, neurotic, inbred families that grew up for just generations in high-rises.
[02:39:34.827 --> 02:39:36.188]  And they're just like, ugh.
[02:39:36.428 --> 02:39:38.049]  And they look down on everyone and hate them.
[02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:42.793]  And they see you with a good-looking family, whether you're black, white, Hispanic.
[02:39:43.033 --> 02:39:43.914]  They see you with a business.
[02:39:43.934 --> 02:39:46.636]  They're like, how does the average person have a big, nice house and a pool?
[02:39:46.856 --> 02:39:47.816]  How are they on vacation?
[02:39:47.836 --> 02:39:48.537]  They say it all the time.
[02:39:48.797 --> 02:39:50.038]  How are they coming to protest us?
[02:39:50.078 --> 02:39:50.939]  Why do they have money?
[02:39:51.179 --> 02:39:52.200]  Make them poor!
[02:39:53.421 --> 02:39:54.802]  Deimos Group has said that years ago.
[02:39:56.271 --> 02:40:00.894]  We're going to make people poor so we can control them.
[02:40:01.334 --> 02:40:02.674]  Oh, as if that makes you richer.
[02:40:03.375 --> 02:40:07.777]  See, they're so poor that they want to make you like they are.
[02:40:07.837 --> 02:40:12.080]  They want to lower you so they can be above you.
[02:40:12.100 --> 02:40:13.140]  That's not the American system.
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:14.101]  That's not the American dream.
[02:40:15.361 --> 02:40:19.844]  And so now, we'll go to break.
[02:40:19.884 --> 02:40:21.185]  We'll play the Chinese when we come back.
[02:40:22.304 --> 02:40:33.488]  I mean, they're just looking at him like, dude, you work for a guy whose son we have on tape screwing 10-year-old Chinese girls and snorting cocaine, and we have Biden doing the same thing.
[02:40:33.588 --> 02:40:34.029]  It's over.
[02:40:34.069 --> 02:40:34.549]  We own you.
[02:40:34.869 --> 02:40:35.729]  What are you doing here?
[02:40:36.209 --> 02:40:39.251]  That's why Biden has told CNN, GCP can take Hong Kong.
[02:40:39.631 --> 02:40:40.811]  GCP can run death camps.
[02:40:42.472 --> 02:40:43.272]  Because he knows.
[02:40:44.873 --> 02:40:47.634]  But his weird little leftist Tony Blinken
[02:40:48.956 --> 02:40:53.439]  He wants to sit up there and be all, we're in charge here.
[02:40:53.479 --> 02:40:55.900]  The Chinese are like, you're not in charge of crap.
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:57.801]  We're not going to sit here and play along.
[02:40:57.841 --> 02:40:58.622]  We own your debt.
[02:40:58.942 --> 02:40:59.922]  We own Hollywood.
[02:41:00.223 --> 02:41:01.343]  We stole the election.
[02:41:01.603 --> 02:41:02.444]  We put you in.
[02:41:02.464 --> 02:41:07.167]  And when we tell you, jump, we say, ha-ha, you say, yes, sir, boss.
[02:41:07.827 --> 02:41:09.068]  Is that clear, Blinken?
[02:41:09.974 --> 02:41:20.226]  Because see Blinken, you've had Americans to kick around and the Green Berets to put on red high heels and learn how to give blowjobs and you've got your pedophile drag queen story time going and you do all that.
[02:41:20.566 --> 02:41:22.768]  But see the Russians and the Chinese aren't like you.
[02:41:23.509 --> 02:41:24.991]  They just want to dominate your ass.
[02:41:25.652 --> 02:41:27.033]  And so now it'll happen to you.
[02:41:27.774 --> 02:41:30.296]  And you'll be removed, and all of you will be removed in the end.
[02:41:30.936 --> 02:41:31.757]  You're all going to lose.
[02:41:32.077 --> 02:41:33.037]  Hollywood's over.
[02:41:33.458 --> 02:41:34.638]  Big-time TV's over.
[02:41:35.279 --> 02:41:37.000]  Mainstream leftism is over.
[02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:37.980]  It's a joke.
[02:41:38.301 --> 02:41:39.081]  It's a failure.
[02:41:39.381 --> 02:41:40.122]  It's a fraud.
[02:41:41.342 --> 02:41:47.206]  And their attempt to steal this election and finish off America will finish them off, and the CHICOMS you watch.
[02:41:48.047 --> 02:41:50.328]  Our once-free societies are being dismantled.
[02:41:51.169 --> 02:41:53.050]  Whether in New Zealand, Australia, Europe,
[02:41:54.534 --> 02:41:56.795]  The UK, the United States, doesn't matter.
[02:41:56.835 --> 02:41:59.137]  It's the same corporations directing the same systems.
[02:41:59.777 --> 02:42:00.798]  And it's meant to be outrageous.
[02:42:00.838 --> 02:42:02.018]  It's meant to be asinine.
[02:42:02.719 --> 02:42:03.980]  It's meant to not make sense.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:04.600]  Look at this article.
[02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:06.681]  Just went live on Infowars.com.
[02:42:07.181 --> 02:42:12.985]  UK police wake 82-year-old woman in the night after someone tattled she had tea with neighbors.
[02:42:15.555 --> 02:42:21.297]  But their borders are wide open, and they don't test illegal aliens coming into England or the US for COVID.
[02:42:22.098 --> 02:42:22.978]  And that's official news.
[02:42:23.038 --> 02:42:24.239]  It's all crap.
[02:42:24.399 --> 02:42:25.459]  It's all a lie.
[02:42:25.779 --> 02:42:28.000]  Stop complying with the fraud.
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:31.682]  The UK police are globalist police, punishing the UK for Brexit.
[02:42:33.963 --> 02:42:35.243]  They admit they're doing this.
[02:42:35.843 --> 02:42:39.225]  And if you just chain reaction the info, it's over for them, and understand.
[02:42:40.779 --> 02:42:44.724]  The globalists invested in China opened it up in the 70s to de-industrialize us.
[02:42:45.185 --> 02:42:47.969]  China was supposed to not be military, though, and be under globalist control.
[02:42:48.309 --> 02:42:49.631]  Of course they double-crossed.
[02:42:50.012 --> 02:42:51.273]  That's all these groups do to each other.
[02:42:52.216 --> 02:42:53.317]  True separation of powers.
[02:42:54.197 --> 02:43:01.563]  And so now the chi-coms don't respect Biden or the people they helped steal the election for, and they're like, what are you doing criticizing us for Uyghur slave camps and stuff?
[02:43:01.823 --> 02:43:05.645]  You've enslaved the black people, which statistically isn't even true!
[02:43:06.526 --> 02:43:11.049]  Less than 20 black people that are innocent a year get shot by police, and I'm not defending that!
[02:43:12.410 --> 02:43:14.572]  You know how many millions of black babies get aborted?
[02:43:14.652 --> 02:43:15.492]  I care about all the babies.
[02:43:15.913 --> 02:43:18.534]  You know how many millions of people that are innocent get sent to prison?
[02:43:18.795 --> 02:43:20.516]  You know how many millions of innocent people
[02:43:22.964 --> 02:43:24.324]  Die of medical malpractice?
[02:43:24.364 --> 02:43:27.065]  You know how many black people are dying from these shots?
[02:43:27.145 --> 02:43:28.065]  I just don't want to hear it!
[02:43:30.426 --> 02:43:37.368]  But I go downtown and I see all these trendy black people and white people and the rest of them together just buying into all the crap and what you are is idiots.
[02:43:38.388 --> 02:43:44.709]  You're under globalist mind control and you're chumps, you're marks, you're suckers, you're schmucks!
[02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:50.371]  And I care about you because if I don't value your life, my life doesn't have value.
[02:43:50.411 --> 02:43:50.951]  You got that?
[02:43:52.486 --> 02:43:57.650]  If I look down on you and hate you just for what color you are, whatever, I lose value in God's eyes.
[02:43:58.190 --> 02:44:01.212]  I see value in you, but let me tell you, you better see value in me!
[02:44:03.814 --> 02:44:05.895]  And you better know how much danger you're in.
[02:44:05.915 --> 02:44:11.159]  Because if you've got any connection to God, that means to God's creation in the universe.
[02:44:11.539 --> 02:44:14.841]  You know you're getting tingles up your spine, because we're all in a lot of danger.
[02:44:14.861 --> 02:44:17.983]  And that's why I'm here.
[02:44:18.003 --> 02:44:18.824]  That's why we're all here.
[02:44:18.844 --> 02:44:21.586]  And I'm here to tell you, danger, danger, Will Robbins.
[02:44:22.955 --> 02:44:30.149]  I don't care what damn color you are or where you even came from, but if you don't understand you're under globalist attack, and if you don't understand this is an anti-human movement, then you're dumb.
[02:44:30.650 --> 02:44:31.872]  And you're turned over to the devil.
[02:44:34.056 --> 02:44:35.317]  Here's that clip I was talking about.
[02:44:35.337 --> 02:44:36.917]  I watched like 30 minutes of it last night.
[02:44:36.937 --> 02:44:37.578]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:44:38.758 --> 02:44:40.559]  This is in Alaska yesterday afternoon.
[02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:42.220]  And this is the U.S.
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:43.781]  envoy to China, Tony Blinken.
[02:44:44.461 --> 02:44:47.803]  And he tries to like half-heartedly bring up some stuff, which is actually good they did.
[02:44:48.203 --> 02:44:57.708]  And the Chinese just bitch-slap him down and use the whole Black Lives Matter thing against him, which they're funding through Hollywood, and basically saying, we'll just have the blacks burn down your country.
[02:44:57.728 --> 02:44:58.128]  Shut up.
[02:44:58.409 --> 02:44:58.829]  Here it is.
[02:44:59.309 --> 02:45:02.431]  We'll also discuss our deep concerns with actions by China.
[02:45:03.328 --> 02:45:11.131]  including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies.
[02:45:12.851 --> 02:45:17.873]  Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability.
[02:45:18.874 --> 02:45:25.576]  That's why they're not merely internal matters and why we feel an obligation to raise these issues here today.
[02:45:26.468 --> 02:45:28.870]  China is firmly opposed to U.S.
[02:45:29.010 --> 02:45:31.491]  interference in China's internal affairs.
[02:45:32.172 --> 02:45:40.897]  We have expressed our staunch opposition to such interference and we will take firm actions in response.
[02:45:41.898 --> 02:45:46.401]  On human rights, we hope that the United States will do better on human rights.
[02:45:47.021 --> 02:45:52.045]  China has made steady progress in human rights and the fact is that
[02:45:53.106 --> 02:45:59.450]  There are many problems within the United States regarding human rights, which is admitted by the U.S.
[02:45:59.590 --> 02:46:00.570]  itself as well.
[02:46:01.150 --> 02:46:10.456]  The United States has also said that countries can't rely on force in today's world to resolve the challenges we face.
[02:46:11.196 --> 02:46:19.681]  And it is a failure to use various means to topple the so-called authoritarian states.
[02:46:20.954 --> 02:46:22.555]  It's impossible to fight back.
[02:46:50.816 --> 02:46:54.937]  Well, you can't blame this problem on somebody else.
[02:46:55.397 --> 02:46:59.658]  I have to tell you, what I'm hearing is very different from what you described.
[02:47:00.838 --> 02:47:07.620]  I'm hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we're re-engaged with our allies and partners.
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:13.321]  I'm also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking.
[02:47:13.641 --> 02:47:15.362]  We think you're doing a great job.
[02:47:15.422 --> 02:47:17.762]  We think you'll follow basic diplomatic etiquette.
[02:47:20.495 --> 02:47:24.337]  Well, I think we thought too well of the United States.
[02:47:24.457 --> 02:47:25.437]  We thought that the U.S.
[02:47:25.497 --> 02:47:29.239]  side will follow the necessary diplomatic protocols.
[02:47:29.719 --> 02:47:32.700]  So for China, it was necessary that we make our position clear.
[02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:56.273]  So let me say here that in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.
[02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:11.473]  Then the Chinese get up and leave, and then Blinken calls the media back over to act tough.
[02:48:11.553 --> 02:48:15.336]  I mean, if you know about diplomacy and how these true groups act, this is unprecedented.
[02:48:15.897 --> 02:48:16.937]  They never acted like that with Trump.
[02:48:16.957 --> 02:48:20.581]  They're always, oh, you're our friend, eat chocolate cake, because they knew Trump was strong.
[02:48:21.101 --> 02:48:26.726]  They are literally just absolutely in Biden's face.
[02:48:26.806 --> 02:48:27.447]  It's disgusting.
[02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:33.033]  Owen Schroyer in the studio right through those doors does a great job every day, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:33.073 --> 02:48:34.234]  hosting The War Room.
[02:48:34.694 --> 02:48:46.021]  And believe me, Big Tech works around the clock with the Chi-Coms and others to make sure no one watches the Alex Jones Show, or American Journal Weekday Mornings with Harrison Smith and Tom Papert and others, or The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[02:48:46.341 --> 02:48:48.923]  That's why you promoting it is everything.
[02:48:48.943 --> 02:48:50.584]  It's like the oxygen in the room.
[02:48:50.704 --> 02:48:53.066]  You don't promote us, we all lose, including you.
[02:48:54.106 --> 02:48:56.287]  So Owen's going to pop in and tell us what's coming up here in just a moment.
[02:48:56.307 --> 02:49:03.270]  I want to get him on every day at the end of the show to tell us what's coming up in just a few minutes on the streams and satellites that his great program is carried.
[02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:10.433]  But separately, he had to end store-wide free shipping, as you know, because the storable food people and others are saying, hey, we're not making any money.
[02:49:10.453 --> 02:49:10.973]  We got to make money.
[02:49:10.993 --> 02:49:11.633]  We're not communists.
[02:49:12.854 --> 02:49:17.236]  Storable food, the biggest part of the cost, one of the biggest costs, is the shipping.
[02:49:18.442 --> 02:49:25.331]  But we do have store-wide free shipping and 50% off on select items in the Mega Blowout Sale!
[02:49:27.025 --> 02:49:30.987]  Mega blowout sale despite the fact that all these products except one are very close to selling out.
[02:49:31.007 --> 02:49:34.068]  We got a big shipment of Brain Force Plus, the great new drug again, 50% off free shipping.
[02:49:34.529 --> 02:49:36.690]  That'll be like that for at least a few weeks till supplies get low.
[02:49:37.030 --> 02:49:39.971]  Prostagard with the Saw Palmetto and all the vitamins and minerals you need.
[02:49:40.231 --> 02:49:41.652]  Made for men and women, designed for men.
[02:49:42.052 --> 02:49:43.753]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[02:49:43.833 --> 02:49:49.716]  Vazobeads, Alpha Power, Dr. Jones Naturals toothpaste, concentrated without any additives.
[02:49:50.436 --> 02:49:58.679]  Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, Activated Charcoal Mouthwash, Dr. Jones Extra Strength Cobb and Chill, Regular Strength Cobb and Chill, and Emrix Essentials.
[02:49:58.879 --> 02:50:05.721]  All of those, the Natural Deodorant, Organic Deodorant, the Body Wash, the Shampoo, 15 Essential Oils.
[02:50:05.741 --> 02:50:07.821]  You can buy them individually or all together discounted.
[02:50:08.421 --> 02:50:15.684]  They're all there, including three Natural Essential Oil Hand Sanitizers in three all-natural scents.
[02:50:15.984 --> 02:50:16.484]  People love it.
[02:50:16.864 --> 02:50:20.287]  InfowarStore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[02:50:20.547 --> 02:50:23.269]  And I can only thank you all for your support.
[02:50:23.629 --> 02:50:30.895]  Please take advantage of the Mega Blowout, sell 50% off and free shipping on those items that I just mentioned at InfowarStore.com.
[02:50:30.995 --> 02:50:32.156]  And we're not supposed to exist anymore.
[02:50:32.416 --> 02:50:36.719]  The tyrants were supposed to have all the power, but because of you, literally, we're still on air.
[02:50:36.759 --> 02:50:39.662]  And don't forget, I'll be back tomorrow, 4 p.m.
[02:50:39.722 --> 02:50:42.223]  Central, for a two-hour transmission.
[02:50:43.084 --> 02:50:46.245]  Takes less crew to do it taped, so we're going to let some of the crew off.
[02:50:46.265 --> 02:50:48.126]  But I'm going to come in at noon, or before noon.
[02:50:48.146 --> 02:50:54.789]  I'm going to tape for two hours, have two hours to doll up the interview and add articles and videos, so it's even better than a live show.
[02:50:54.889 --> 02:50:55.669]  And then 4 p.m.
[02:50:55.709 --> 02:51:01.252]  Central, we're going to air a big special report on a bunch of breaking news and developments, and a lot of key intel.
[02:51:01.292 --> 02:51:03.253]  I want to have commercial free to get into Crimson.
[02:51:04.053 --> 02:51:09.517]  Contagion and the gene therapy and how they're planning cancer in us and just the total proof that's coming out.
[02:51:09.537 --> 02:51:10.438]  That's 4 p.m.
[02:51:10.558 --> 02:51:11.779]  Central, 5 p.m.
[02:51:11.819 --> 02:51:13.000]  Eastern, 3 p.m.
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:13.881]  Mountain, 2 p.m.
[02:51:13.921 --> 02:51:14.341]  Pacific.
[02:51:14.381 --> 02:51:18.885]  Tomorrow InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com and of course all
[02:51:19.025 --> 02:51:24.271]  The other great radio affiliates, TV affiliates, pick us up and please support those local affiliates and spread the word about them.
[02:51:24.311 --> 02:51:24.992]  They are precious.
[02:51:25.012 --> 02:51:26.173]  Start tithing to those stations.
[02:51:26.394 --> 02:51:27.215]  They're better than your church.
[02:51:27.235 --> 02:51:28.096]  They're not fighting abortion.
[02:51:28.616 --> 02:51:31.760]  Owen Schroyer, you're going live here in about four or five minutes.
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:33.562]  There's two minutes left in our transmission.
[02:51:33.842 --> 02:51:35.864]  Tell us what's coming up on The War Room today.
[02:51:37.165 --> 02:51:43.050]  Well, it's really incredible the embarrassment that the Biden administration has been on the world stage this week, Alex.
[02:51:43.210 --> 02:51:45.913]  We had Biden's saber-rattling with Putin.
[02:51:46.073 --> 02:51:48.095]  The guy, Biden, couldn't even pick up a saber.
[02:51:48.455 --> 02:51:51.418]  Well, beyond saber-rattling, we're going to get you, you're evil, look out.
[02:51:51.458 --> 02:51:53.480]  I mean, this is trying to start a war stuff.
[02:51:54.571 --> 02:51:58.455]  Well, and Biden doesn't even know what's going on, so he may be starting a war, he may not.
[02:51:58.535 --> 02:52:00.076]  I mean, that's the danger of the situation.
[02:52:00.236 --> 02:52:06.542]  Then the Chinese delegation showing up in Anchorage, Alaska yesterday and just slapping the Biden administration in the face.
[02:52:07.043 --> 02:52:09.205]  Secretary Blinken is just blinking.
[02:52:09.245 --> 02:52:10.166]  He was caught off guard.
[02:52:10.206 --> 02:52:11.507]  That was a total embarrassment.
[02:52:11.847 --> 02:52:15.171]  And then today, Biden can't even get up a flight of stairs.
[02:52:15.811 --> 02:52:20.075]  So really quite an embarrassing week on the world stage for Joe Biden in the United States of America.
[02:52:20.296 --> 02:52:22.077]  But this is what the Democrats love, Alex.
[02:52:22.117 --> 02:52:24.179]  This is what the liberal progressive left loves.
[02:52:24.220 --> 02:52:25.781]  They love seeing America weakened.
[02:52:26.021 --> 02:52:31.267]  They love seeing us be removed down the pegs in the power structure of the world.
[02:52:31.287 --> 02:52:32.888]  That's what Haas said a few months ago.
[02:52:33.309 --> 02:52:35.070]  Haas said we're going to end America with Biden.
[02:52:35.130 --> 02:52:35.631]  He said it!
[02:52:35.831 --> 02:52:36.432]  And they're doing it!
[02:52:38.035 --> 02:52:45.838]  So we're not really surprised by this, but I think that it's time for the United States of America to take a serious look in the mirror and say, you know what?
[02:52:46.378 --> 02:52:48.038]  We messed up big time.
[02:52:48.558 --> 02:52:53.060]  And we're seeing the recall petitions for Newsom, we're seeing petitions to get
[02:52:53.720 --> 02:52:54.420]  Cuomo out.
[02:52:54.500 --> 02:52:56.041]  We need to have a national petition.
[02:52:56.061 --> 02:53:01.102]  In fact, next week may be the time to start the drive, considering how bad this week has been for Biden.
[02:53:01.622 --> 02:53:03.223]  Next week may be the time to start the drive.
[02:53:03.263 --> 02:53:04.263]  We should start a petition.
[02:53:04.283 --> 02:53:06.204]  Yeah, we should start the states to have a CONCOM.
[02:53:06.224 --> 02:53:07.144]  We're already in an emergency.
[02:53:07.184 --> 02:53:08.204]  I know CONCOMs are dangerous.
[02:53:08.504 --> 02:53:09.304]  To withdraw him.
[02:53:09.344 --> 02:53:09.905]  He's a fraud.
[02:53:10.325 --> 02:53:13.766]  Owen, so much more coming up in two minutes when you start the War Room.
[02:53:13.786 --> 02:53:18.307]  Streams are at BandopVideoInfoWars.com and stations everywhere picking it up.
[02:53:18.687 --> 02:53:19.387]  So much more.
[02:53:19.467 --> 02:53:20.187]  The War Room.
[02:53:20.307 --> 02:53:21.728]  Anna, you've got some guests on too, right?
[02:53:22.228 --> 02:53:24.892]  Yeah, we do have a guest from Rebel News, Andrew Says.
[02:53:24.912 --> 02:53:27.997]  Alright, Owen Shore of the War Room coming up.
[02:53:28.037 --> 02:53:30.582]  I'll see you back tomorrow, 4 p.m., with a Saturday special.
[02:53:35.587 --> 02:53:38.989]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:53:39.309 --> 02:53:43.011]  How much heat have you gotten for being friends with him and having him on the show?
[02:53:43.151 --> 02:53:44.552]  A lot, but I don't pay attention.
[02:53:44.832 --> 02:53:45.072]  Okay.
[02:53:45.672 --> 02:53:45.892]  Yeah.
[02:53:46.633 --> 02:53:48.514]  I just, I can justify it.
[02:53:49.174 --> 02:53:52.956]  Look, I mean, I won't justify the things he's gotten wrong, and I don't think he will either.
[02:53:53.396 --> 02:53:56.957]  But I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[02:53:57.557 --> 02:54:07.301]  And when he was on this podcast, and he talked about how 80% of the people that took the Moderna vaccine had significant side effects, particularly after the second dose, people were like, no f***ing way.
[02:54:07.621 --> 02:54:13.523]  So we played Bill Gates, and I put it on my, because people were saying, you had an anti-vaxxer on your podcast.
[02:54:14.043 --> 02:54:19.945]  I played the Bill Gates clip where Bill Gates is being interviewed by CBS, and he says it himself.
[02:54:20.305 --> 02:54:29.548]  After the second dose, at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side effect, ranging from severe chills to fevers.
[02:54:30.088 --> 02:54:32.249]  So, are these vaccines safe?
[02:54:32.589 --> 02:54:37.970]  The FDA, not being pressured, will look hard at that.
[02:54:38.131 --> 02:54:42.532]  But the data showed that everybody with a high dose had a side effect.
[02:54:43.140 --> 02:54:48.327]  Yeah, but some of that is not dramatic, where it's just super painful.
[02:54:48.367 --> 02:54:52.213]  But yes, we need to make sure there's not severe side effects.
[02:54:52.293 --> 02:54:58.822]  The FDA, I think, will do a good job of that, despite the pressure.
[02:54:59.062 --> 02:55:01.585]  Just like the nurse was telling us earlier today when we got tested.
[02:55:01.925 --> 02:55:03.587]  She experienced chills and shakes.
[02:55:03.607 --> 02:55:04.849]  And she said all her friends did too.
[02:55:04.869 --> 02:55:05.970]  Yep, all her friends did.
[02:55:06.290 --> 02:55:09.374]  So this is something that Alex was saying and people were denying it.
[02:55:09.834 --> 02:55:18.645]  Also, Alex was talking about how children in Sudan were involuntarily given these polio vaccines and a lot of them got polio.
[02:55:19.085 --> 02:55:19.925]  From the vaccine.
[02:55:19.945 --> 02:55:20.625]  We were like, what?
[02:55:20.985 --> 02:55:24.406]  So then he shows us there's a f***ing AP News report.
[02:55:24.766 --> 02:55:29.327]  An article from AP, Associated Press, that shows this poor little terrified child.
[02:55:29.347 --> 02:55:30.988]  And they're squeezing his mouth open.
[02:55:31.008 --> 02:55:33.208]  They dropped this oral vaccine in his mouth.
[02:55:33.428 --> 02:55:38.250]  And it talked about how many of these kids got polio from this vaccine.
[02:55:38.650 --> 02:55:41.870]  These are things that Alex says that you're not hearing people talk about this.
[02:55:41.910 --> 02:55:44.811]  This is not something that's mainstream discussed.
[02:55:45.051 --> 02:55:48.512]  And it doesn't mean that vaccines are bad, but this is a fact.
[02:55:51.508 --> 02:55:55.891]  Every listener has to spread this link right now or I'm going to die.
[02:56:05.739 --> 02:56:10.943]  Well, we knew this news was coming, so I'm not pleased to be proven right yet again, but here it is.
[02:56:11.563 --> 02:56:12.985]  I've got CNBC.
[02:56:13.205 --> 02:56:14.606]  I've got CNBC.
[02:56:14.846 --> 02:56:16.227]  I've got the New York Post.
[02:56:16.747 --> 02:56:18.068]  I mean, I've got them all right here.
[02:56:19.510 --> 02:56:20.811]  And they say, oh, guess what?
[02:56:21.578 --> 02:56:22.678]  It's not a pandemic.
[02:56:23.679 --> 02:56:24.619]  It's endemic.
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:29.001]  Like when they say, America is racist and white people are inherently bad.
[02:56:29.562 --> 02:56:31.863]  Racism is endemic amongst them.
[02:56:32.803 --> 02:56:36.665]  Which is total racism by the establishment and by the left trying to create a race war.
[02:56:37.485 --> 02:56:44.248]  Martin Luther King was right when he said, you judge people by the character of what they do and the content of their deeds.
[02:56:44.628 --> 02:56:45.809]  You don't do it off what color they are.
[02:56:45.849 --> 02:56:46.989]  But that's what they're saying.
[02:56:47.049 --> 02:56:48.070]  Well, now they're saying,
[02:56:49.448 --> 02:56:50.289]  COVID's endemic.
[02:56:50.349 --> 02:56:55.913]  It's a common cold virus that Bill Gates manipulated and patented so he owns it with Fauci and the UN.
[02:56:57.133 --> 02:57:12.464]  And so the vaccines aren't going to work and it's never going to go away and Fauci said last week and Bill Gates said this week that you still won't be able to go outside or go have a job or anything because if one person dies of COVID in New Zealand or the US or the UK no one can ever go outside again.
[02:57:13.185 --> 02:57:19.049]  People have always died of the flu and always died of the cold and we know they've lied about the numbers from car wrecks and motorcycle wrecks and
[02:57:19.793 --> 02:57:24.315]  People with heart attacks and cancer and the flu and pneumonia.
[02:57:24.495 --> 02:57:26.316]  All of that, they admit, has been put in the column.
[02:57:26.336 --> 02:57:26.896]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:57:27.237 --> 02:57:28.897]  Don't question the science or you'll be censored.
[02:57:29.138 --> 02:57:29.838]  You'll be fired.
[02:57:30.558 --> 02:57:37.382]  And so the very people that cooked this up at Wuhan and launched it and lied to us about the death numbers, saying 4% would die.
[02:57:37.402 --> 02:57:38.342]  It wasn't even 1% to 1%.
[02:57:39.743 --> 02:57:41.023]  We're still supposed to listen to them.
[02:57:41.323 --> 02:57:42.004]  So here's the headline.
[02:57:42.104 --> 02:57:43.985]  Experts say COVID could become endemic.
[02:57:44.898 --> 02:57:45.679]  Hope that means for you.
[02:57:45.719 --> 02:57:48.464]  And it goes on to say, oh, there'll be new versions.
[02:57:49.025 --> 02:57:50.507]  COVID-19, COVID-20, 2021, 2022.
[02:57:51.929 --> 02:57:54.693]  In fact, even major Hollywood producers.
[02:57:56.394 --> 02:58:04.437]  Have movies coming out, like Songbird, about how the lockdown's never going to end, never going to stop, and soon there'll be camps and checkpoints.
[02:58:04.857 --> 02:58:05.837]  But that's just a movie, right?
[02:58:05.897 --> 02:58:15.381]  No, they have the contact tracers in Australia, in the UK, and now in Canada, arresting people that try to walk down the street, beating up women, beating up men, strip-searching them.
[02:58:15.901 --> 02:58:17.942]  This is the excuse for martial law.
[02:58:18.342 --> 02:58:26.125]  This is the excuse to take over the producers and break the will of the people that voted for Brexit, or voted for Trump, or voted for Bolsonaro.
[02:58:27.230 --> 02:58:30.991]  This is a authoritarian takeover and it's so incredibly criminal.
[02:58:31.171 --> 02:58:32.531]  Here's Bill Gates, CNBC.
[02:58:32.851 --> 02:58:33.951]  Bill Gates on mask.
[02:58:34.511 --> 02:58:38.512]  He goes on to say, if you're vaccinated, you can still transmit.
[02:58:39.312 --> 02:58:39.712]  Really?
[02:58:39.893 --> 02:58:40.353]  Wow.
[02:58:42.233 --> 02:58:43.573]  So now you can't go out.
[02:58:44.633 --> 02:58:46.414]  I'm not going to stop wearing mask.
[02:58:47.654 --> 02:58:51.015]  See, because they're never going to let go this power grab.
[02:58:51.495 --> 02:58:52.175]  It's a problem.
[02:58:53.100 --> 02:58:55.702]  That has no solution except giving them more control.
[02:58:56.182 --> 02:58:57.423]  And that's why they're doing this.
[02:58:58.023 --> 02:59:02.986]  So at the end of the day, they have the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post all around the clock working to shut us down.
[02:59:03.386 --> 02:59:07.088]  They have the FBI counterterrorism team in the news saying they're investigating us.
[02:59:07.389 --> 02:59:08.509]  They've come and talked to my employees.
[02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:12.592]  The power structure is breaking America right now.
[02:59:12.752 --> 02:59:14.153]  This is a foreign takeover.
[02:59:14.253 --> 02:59:18.355]  And all I can tell you is they're coming for our children now.
[02:59:18.455 --> 02:59:19.496]  I've got the articles right here.
[02:59:19.901 --> 02:59:20.121]  Yes.
[02:59:41.883 --> 02:59:44.184]  All those things at InfoWareStore.com while you still can.
