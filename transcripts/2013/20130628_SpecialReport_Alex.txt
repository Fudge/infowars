[00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:12.301]  At 2 a.m.
[00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:17.683]  Thursday morning, the New York City Council made a decision that's going to affect the Stop and Frisk program.
[00:00:18.043 --> 00:00:27.526]  The cops know who the wise guys are, they know who the dealers are, they know who... Supporters of the Oversight Committee see the move as a way to keep an eye on a police department that has been targeting specific groups.
[00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.927]  But how will this measure be enforced?
[00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:50.439]  Intro 1079 creates an independent inspector general to monitor the police department, and Intro 1080, according to the Atlantic Wire, would allow individuals to sue the police department in state court, not only for individual instances of bias, but also for policies that disproportionately affect people in any protected categories.
[00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:57.083]  Mayor Bloomberg told churchgoers in Brownsville, Brooklyn, that the program keeps guns off the streets and keeps New Yorkers safe.
[00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:03.508]  Through these stops, the police have recovered thousands of guns over the past decade and tens of thousands of other weapons.
[00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:11.215]  Mayor Bloomberg said it would leave the NYPD pointlessly hammered by outside intrusion and recklessly threatened by second-guessing from the courts.
[00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:15.319]  In the past, Bloomberg said that it should be amended and not ended.
[00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:17.190]  What does this really mean?
[00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.773]  Somehow, I have a feeling that it'll go somewhere along the lines with limiting hot dogs and making sure that you can't have a large Slurpee.
[00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:26.054]  Thank you, Mr. Bloomberg.
