[00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:15.418]  Thank you so much.
[00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:23.283]  I've got a proclamation on behalf of the Mayor and City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:34.831]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently, but because of the work that we're doing here today,
[00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:40.014]  We will make your side legitimate shortly, so you hang on to that.
[00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:45.597]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars Nightly News with a gun owner emergency alert.
[00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:56.462]  We sent our reporters out to the Texas Capitol here in Austin to film the Mayor Bloomberg sponsored event with the Austin Police Chief.
[00:00:57.282 --> 00:01:17.199]  calling for the restriction of the second amendment shutting down the gun shows not having private sales restricting quote high-capacity magazines and city councilman mike martinez who's set to be the next mayor came out and pointed a man in the audience who had a sign saying stop the gun ban
[00:01:18.363 --> 00:01:21.904]  And he said, listen, buddy, you're trying to make attention yelling over there.
[00:01:21.924 --> 00:01:23.484]  We're going to play the clip here in a moment.
[00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:26.245]  He says, that's not happening yet.
[00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:30.326]  But once we do this, that is going to happen to thunderous applause.
[00:01:31.246 --> 00:01:37.987]  Everywhere these collectivists have been in control, not just worldwide, but in Chicago, New York, and other areas, they've banned the guns.
[00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:41.128]  But first, they register them.
[00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.088]  First, they register them.
[00:01:43.488 --> 00:01:45.789]  And he says to them, hey, we're not banning your guns right now.
[00:01:46.914 --> 00:01:50.597]  We're going to do what we're doing now, which is registration, and then we're going to take them.
[00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:55.422]  And that's what they've done everywhere, and that's what's so frustrating about this.
[00:01:56.022 --> 00:02:02.968]  We have the clip of the Attorney General, back when he was Deputy Attorney General, saying, we're going to brainwash the public against guns in the media.
[00:02:03.168 --> 00:02:08.273]  And what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people.
[00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:14.178]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:18.862]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:25.848]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:02:26.348 --> 00:02:34.095]  And then of course we have the clip of Dianne Feinstein on 60 Minutes saying if she had the votes, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn in your semi-autos.
[00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:35.837]  If I could have gotten
[00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:44.244]  51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them.
[00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:47.266]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:02:47.807 --> 00:02:48.507]  I would have done it.
[00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:51.550]  And after they've gotten those, they're going to take all the rest.
[00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.073]  The truth is, they're buying millions of bullets, they're buying armored vehicles.
[00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:57.515]  This is an authoritarian takeover.
[00:02:58.155 --> 00:03:01.938]  And when Obama was a state senator, he was for the total abolition of firearms ownership.
[00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:06.401]  The UN treaty they're trying to ratify right now in the Senate does the same thing.
[00:03:06.942 --> 00:03:09.123]  And they admit it in our face.
[00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:18.810]  Even deep in the heart of Texas, Mr. Martinez gets up and says, basically, after we register your guns, we are going to confiscate them.
[00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:25.175]  I've got a proclamation on behalf of the Mayor and City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:32.281]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:39.864]  But, because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly.
[00:03:40.264 --> 00:03:42.886]  So you hang on to that.
[00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:47.388]  Mexico has a total gun ban and has had 60,000 gun deaths the last six years.
[00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:50.129]  Because only the government and criminals have guns.
[00:03:51.263 --> 00:04:01.346]  This Second Amendment is a right of all Americans, and it's despicable that these authoritarians creep around on the news and say, we just want reasonable restriction.
[00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:02.867]  Register.
[00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:07.428]  When they're on record, all of them saying they plan to confiscate all our guns.
[00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:10.590]  Yes, these men and their hypnotized followers call this a new order.
[00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.390]  It is not new and it is not order.
