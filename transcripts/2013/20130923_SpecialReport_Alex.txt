[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:06.055]  The iPhone 5S just launched, but the NYPD seems to be big fans of the new security features.
[00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:19.290]  Police officers were handing out flyers to people around New York City on Saturday, nudging them to upgrade their devices to Apple's new iOS 7 operating system, saying the software gives added security to your devices.
[00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.035]  Sure, the new iOS security features include a Find My iPhone activation lock, which when enabled would prevent a thief from disabling the tracking system.
[00:00:28.296 --> 00:00:36.201]  But a pretty major oversight lets thieves quickly and easily prevent users from using the Find My iPhone to track and locate their stolen device.
[00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:48.184]  Another flaw discovered by security experts lets anyone bypass PIN or passcode protected lock screens to send emails, update your status on social networks, access your photos, you name it.
[00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:52.705]  So does the added security come from the new fingerprint recognition software?
[00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:57.627]  The built-in fingerprint scanner reads a user's prints, replacing the need for a password.
[00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:02.928]  The phone uses a high-res image to determine whether the fingerprint belongs to the owner or not.
[00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:08.310]  And there's no need to worry about a thief coming along and chopping off your finger to use it to get into your phone.
[00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.673]  Apple says they already worked this out by making sure the sensor will only recognize a live finger with a recognizable pulse.
[00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:21.156]  But the iPhone 5S has only been out for the weekend and it's already been hacked.
[00:01:21.616 --> 00:01:28.964]  A German hacker group known as the Chaos Computing Club claims to have already defeated Apple's Touch ID using a fabricated print.
[00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:33.849]  The hackers simply made a fake finger mold using a photo of a fingerprint.
[00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:41.497]  You know, those fingerprints that you unwillingly leave everywhere, like your keyboard, a mouse, a coffee cup, the subway doors.
[00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:46.879]  Well, and apparently you don't even need access to a printer in order to get past Touch ID.
[00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:49.880]  You can unlock the iPhone 5S with your nipples!
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.662]  Granted, the nipple is possibly a more secure body part to register, since you don't go around leaving those prints everywhere.
[00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:57.742]  Hopefully.
[00:01:58.103 --> 00:02:01.744]  But it sure would be awkward getting into your phone at a restaurant.
[00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:05.805]  And some users have even registered their phones using paw prints.
[00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:10.566]  So this super secure iPhone 5S has already been hacked into.
[00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:16.308]  So why is the NYPD actively pushing for people to upgrade to a safer operating system?
[00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:18.768]  You'd think they were on the payroll or something.
[00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:29.691]  Well it turns out the NYPD's public awareness notice also urges people to register their devices with their Operation Identification Program.
[00:02:29.972 --> 00:02:35.193]  It's never available to other software and it's never stored on Apple servers or backed up to iCloud.
[00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:39.869]  But what about when your fingerprints are backed up into the NYPD database?
[00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:49.154]  Operation Identification Program might help the NYPD cut down on petty crime, but it also means that your fingerprints are going to be linked in their database.
[00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:57.880]  So not only are they violating your Fourth Amendment with their stop-and-frisk policy, but now they want you to just hand over your biometric data.
[00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:00.815]  But it's okay.
[00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:01.955]  You're not a criminal.
[00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.916]  You're just a concerned parent.
[00:03:04.497 --> 00:03:06.478]  Or a conscientious protester.
[00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:09.640]  Maybe you're just a college kid going to the store.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.742]  Or just minding your business at a bus stop.
[00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:16.324]  The police want you to use your upgraded iPhone for safety.
[00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:22.368]  Just as long as you don't turn it around on them for your own protection while filming police brutality.
