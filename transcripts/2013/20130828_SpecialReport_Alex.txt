[00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:20.743]  This is about the large-scale indiscriminate use of weapons that the civilized world long ago decided must never be used at all.
[00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:25.607]  The supposed use of sarin gas in Syria is now being used as a pretext for war.
[00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:30.411]  But when did the civilized world decide that sarin gas shouldn't be used?
[00:00:30.972 --> 00:00:37.817]  And how different is sarin gas from the weapons of mass destruction that the civilized world wants to use on innocent Syrian civilians?
[00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:44.022]  Developed by the Nazis' own IG Farben, creators of Zyklon B used for mass murder in concentration camps,
[00:00:44.742 --> 00:00:48.164]  Sarin gas was a standard chemical military weapon of both the U.S.
[00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:49.224]  and the USSR.
[00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:53.586]  And in the 1950s, it was adopted by NATO as a standard chemical weapon.
[00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:54.627]  The U.S.
[00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:58.508]  military industrial complex made a science out of sarin delivery.
[00:00:59.028 --> 00:01:04.211]  Pictured here is the M-134 bomblet, designed for the M-190 Honest John rocket warhead.
[00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:13.115]  The bomblets carried sarin nerve agent and were released 5,000 feet above their target, saturating an area 1,000 meters in diameter with sarin gas.
[00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:15.596]  Does Syria possess anything like that?
[00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:18.398]  But of course, it was okay because we had it.
[00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.420]  It defies any code of morality.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.681]  Let me be clear.
[00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:32.727]  The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children, and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity.
[00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:37.079]  After using and weaponizing sarin gas for over 40 years, the U.S.
[00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.842]  signed a treaty in 1993 to ban its use.
[00:01:40.523 --> 00:01:44.087]  Five years later, CNN and Time Magazine both broke a story about the U.S.'
[00:01:44.047 --> 00:01:46.129]  's use of sarin gas during Vietnam.
[00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.515]  In the firestorm of controversy, CNN and Time fired the reporters and declared the story false.
[00:01:52.256 --> 00:02:00.641]  However, the reporters pushed back with a 77-page document backing up their allegations, and April Oliver won a $1 million lawsuit against CNN.
[00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:12.929]  But just the presence of sarin gas in Syria, regardless of whether it was used by the rebels, by the CIA and Jordanian commandos that Le Figaro reported entered Syria a couple of weeks earlier, or whether it was actually the Syrian government,
[00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.411]  The use of chemical weapons is supposed to be justification for the U.S.
[00:02:17.452 --> 00:02:25.297]  military-industrial complex to rain death down on tens or hundreds of times more innocent men, women, and children than were killed in this attack.
[00:02:25.657 --> 00:02:28.259]  But chemical weapons experts not affiliated with the U.S.
[00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.002]  government have cast doubt on whether sarin was actually the chemical used.
[00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:36.104]  500 times more toxic than cyanide, it can kill within one minute.
[00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:39.746]  And it will kill first responders who don't wear protective clothing.
[00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:44.468]  That this apparently didn't happen makes it doubtful that the chemical used was sarin.
[00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:47.690]  And how does sarin gas compare to weapons that the U.S.
[00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.771]  has used and continues to use?
[00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:53.513]  Millions of gallons of Agent Orange were dropped in Vietnam during the war.
[00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:59.937]  Nearly 50 years later, three generations later, it is still showing up in horrible birth defects.
[00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:02.798]  And it didn't just affect Vietnamese civilians.
[00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.501]  American soldiers are dying from cancer and having difficulty getting the U.S.
[00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:11.063]  government to accept responsibility, having to fight one by one against the VA.
[00:03:11.584 --> 00:03:12.044]  And the U.S.
[00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:17.027]  continues to use weapons that would mean a slow death sentence for those who survived the war, both U.S.
[00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:18.688]  soldiers and foreign citizens.
[00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.190]  That would be depleted uranium.
[00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.731]  At about the same time the U.S.
[00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:27.554]  agreed to ban the use of sarin gas, it reversed its policy and began exposing U.S.
[00:03:27.614 --> 00:03:29.135]  soldiers to depleted uranium.
[00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:35.762]  Like Agent Orange, it is also a persistent poison, killing slowly and causing birth defects.
[00:03:37.043 --> 00:03:46.714]  Our sense of basic humanity is offended, not only by this cowardly crime, but also by the cynical attempt to cover it up.
[00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:52.542]  The American government's hypocrisy over the use of weapons of mass destruction is a stench before heaven.
[00:03:52.942 --> 00:04:00.044]  That they would use this to justify the murder of tens of thousands more people is what should offend our sense of humanity.
