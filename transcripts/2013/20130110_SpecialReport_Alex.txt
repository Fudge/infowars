[00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:08.865]  Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Dykes here for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:14.931]  Now you're probably aware of Alex's interview last night on CNN during primetime with Piers Morgan.
[00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:16.673]  It's at the top of Twitter feeds.
[00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:18.094]  It's all over the internet.
[00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:22.539]  It's been covered in hundreds of news outlets and it caused quite a firestorm.
[00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.342]  Here's just a few clips from that powerful appearance.
[00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:28.904]  The Second Amendment isn't there for duck hunting.
[00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:34.127]  It's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs.
[00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.147]  Take the women in India.
[00:00:35.388 --> 00:00:46.654]  Your piece earlier on CNN, I was watching during Anderson Cooper's show, didn't tell you that the women of India have signed giant petitions to get firearms because the police can't and won't protect them.
[00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:47.815]  The answer is...
[00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:48.635]  Hey, wait a minute.
[00:00:48.676 --> 00:00:52.659]  I have FBI crime statistics that come out a year late.
[00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.241]  2011, 20 plus percent crime drop in the last nine years.
[00:00:56.822 --> 00:01:00.264]  Real violent crime because more guns means less crime.
[00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:02.746]  Britain took the guns 15, 16 years ago.
[00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:05.548]  Tripling of your overall violent crime.
[00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:10.232]  True, we have a higher gun violence level, but overall muggings, stabbings, deaths.
[00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:11.893]  Look, you got your little note cards.
[00:01:11.913 --> 00:01:15.756]  I just gave you FBI statistics that violent crime and gun
[00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:16.516]  Alex.
[00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:18.757]  Alex, let me just ask you this.
[00:01:18.837 --> 00:01:19.077]  No.
[00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:20.558]  They're not little factoids.
[00:01:20.578 --> 00:01:20.818]  Alex.
[00:01:21.058 --> 00:01:22.239]  I don't have a bodyguard.
[00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.099]  I don't have a bodyguard.
[00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.365]  Now this interview has caused its own backlash.
[00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:35.907]  They ended that interview early.
[00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:38.149]  They were originally going to give Alex a third segment.
[00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:39.330]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.651]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:41.812]  Mao took the guns.
[00:01:41.992 --> 00:01:43.333]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:01:43.473 --> 00:01:44.715]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:50.179]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.643]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.165]  We will not relinquish them.
[00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:57.306]  Do you understand?
[00:01:57.526 --> 00:02:03.793]  Instead they just brought on their other guests to help demonize Alex and say that he shouldn't be allowed to own guns.
[00:02:04.413 --> 00:02:10.320]  He's really one of the reasons why I'm so concerned about the lack of gun control in America.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.242]  He's a man that owns 50 weapons.
[00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.505]  He has a sort of pathological view about it.
[00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:17.467]  He seems unhinged to me.
[00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:32.963]  Every hour, practically on the hour, they've been replaying certain clips of the interview and trying to imply that Alex Jones went, quote, off his rocker, that he's somehow crazy for being passionate in the defense of the Second Amendment.
[00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:35.025]  Here's just a few of the things they're saying.
[00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:46.410]  Radio host Alex Jones created the Deport Piers Morgan petition to protest the CNN anchor's anti-gun position and last night he brought the crazy in a rambling pro-gun tirade.
[00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.293]  Radio host Alex Jones created the Deport Piers Morgan petition and posted it on the White House website.
[00:02:52.753 --> 00:02:57.836]  Last night he kind of went off his rocker telling peers that more guns mean less crime.
[00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:01.898]  Jones went completely into rant mode last night.
[00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:02.458]  Here's what he said.
[00:03:03.393 --> 00:03:04.653]  Alex Jones is a lot of things.
[00:03:04.673 --> 00:03:05.294]  He's a 9-11 truther.
[00:03:05.334 --> 00:03:06.654]  He's the guy, by the way, that Charlie
[00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:28.501]  But what are they doing that for?
[00:03:28.922 --> 00:03:49.146]  Here's the second part of what they're saying on CNN where they argue, here's Alex Jones, he's gone too far, he's on one side of the issue against disarmament, the other side of the issue is these crazy psychotic killers shouldn't be able to get their hands on assault rifles, which is a branded politicized term, and they say we should meet in the middle.
[00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:51.308]  Here's how we go in the gun control debate every single time.
[00:03:51.388 --> 00:04:00.757]  We go from, should we be talking about AR-15 style weapons and how easily you can get them, more easily than you can get a package of Sudafed, to suddenly, we're going to take everyone's guns away.
[00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:02.278]  There's a big middle there.
[00:04:02.378 --> 00:04:04.120]  I'm going to say there is a middle.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.303]  And the middle doesn't necessarily have to be a bad compromise.
[00:04:07.463 --> 00:04:08.063]  I think so.
[00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:35.519]  And I think President Obama is talking about taking some very sensible middle ground positions.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.486]  Now here's just a few more clips from the lengthy debate Alex had last night on CNN.
[00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:42.307]  Here it is.
[00:04:42.327 --> 00:04:44.029]  Why do people need them?
[00:04:44.963 --> 00:04:47.644]  They need them to protect us from the number one killer in history.
[00:04:47.944 --> 00:04:53.265]  Government in the 20th century, a university study out of Hawaii killed 292 million people.
[00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:54.726]  It's called democide.
[00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:55.706]  Google it, folks.
[00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:57.346]  Tell me why I'm wrong about the AR-15.
[00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:58.787]  Why don't you want to get rid of the drugs?
[00:04:58.807 --> 00:05:00.087]  Because they're half your sponsors?
[00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:01.408]  Stick to the subject.
[00:05:01.428 --> 00:05:04.668]  America's number one cause of unnatural death now is suicide.
[00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:09.690]  I want to get people off pills that the insert says would make you commit suicide and kill people!
[00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:11.743]  Let's get to the second amendment.
[00:05:11.763 --> 00:05:13.664]  I want to blame the real culprit!
[00:05:13.704 --> 00:05:14.904]  Suicide pills!
[00:05:15.204 --> 00:05:16.524]  Mass murder pills!
[00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:30.368]  And if you think Alex went too far talking over Piers and vociferously voicing his point of view, you better keep in mind what Piers Morgan has been doing to other defenders of the Second Amendment during the past several weeks, particularly in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting.
[00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:33.429]  He's been demonizing people like Larry Pratt of gun owners.
[00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:43.998]  He's been implying that other defenders of the Second Amendment somehow celebrate the dead children from Sandy Hook, that they don't care about the suffering of people caused by guns.
[00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:57.712]  No, they're trying to defend a right and Piers Morgan is trying to manipulate you through these media techniques of constantly showing the tragedy and implying that he's somehow morally superior when he hasn't got a leg to stand on.
[00:05:57.912 --> 00:06:03.618]  I already said earlier, England has a lot lower gun crime rate because you took all the guns.
[00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:08.682]  But you've got hordes of people burning down cities and beating old women's brains out every day.
[00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.404]  They arrest people.
[00:06:10.444 --> 00:06:11.725]  You've had to flee here, bud.
[00:06:12.486 --> 00:06:13.467]  Why don't you tell folks?
[00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:14.708]  Yeah, you fled here.
[00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:18.331]  Why don't you go back and face the charges for the hacking scandal?
[00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.312]  Answer this question.
[00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:24.055]  How many... Why don't you get fired from the Daily Mirror for putting out fake stories?
[00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:26.437]  You're a hatchet man of the New World Order.
[00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:27.718]  You're a hatchet man.
[00:06:27.998 --> 00:06:29.099]  And I want to say this right here.
[00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:30.099]  You think you're a tough guy?
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.004]  Have me back with a boxing ring in here, and I'll wear red, white, and blue, and you can wear your Jolly Roger.
[00:06:36.704 --> 00:06:51.589]  As we go to a few more clips from Alex on Piers last night, let's be reminded of the words of Barry Goldwater, who said, Remember what Jesus Christ did when he went to the temple to protest the bankers.
[00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:56.111]  He turned over the tables, caused a complete fit because they were so wrong.
[00:06:56.551 --> 00:06:56.772]  I think so.
[00:07:14.275 --> 00:07:15.756]  You will not take my right.
[00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:17.738]  You go through background checks to get guns.
[00:07:18.018 --> 00:07:18.859]  How about Prozac?
[00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:21.101]  You know the number one... Oh, that's the big sponsor, isn't it?
[00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:22.402]  Or that whole class of drugs.
[00:07:22.422 --> 00:07:23.062]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:07:23.162 --> 00:07:24.804]  Oh, whoa, gotta cut that off, don't you?
[00:07:24.824 --> 00:07:26.745]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[00:07:26.825 --> 00:07:32.390]  number one cause of death is suicide now, because they give people suicide mass murder pills.
[00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.870]  Calm down.
[00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:38.115]  Your answer is give more money to the psychiatrist and psychologist to put more crazy people on drugs that make them kill people, Pierce.
[00:07:38.135 --> 00:07:39.416]  Let's try and have a debate here.
[00:07:39.676 --> 00:07:39.916]  Yeah.
[00:07:40.197 --> 00:07:41.138]  Answer me this question.
[00:07:41.198 --> 00:07:42.759]  I'm sick of the same old script here, bud.
[00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:43.780]  It's fine, bud.
[00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:49.666]  It probably won't happen overnight, but we can't let them fudge it and incrementally destroy it either.
[00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:58.735]  We must stand firm, put our line in the sand for the Second Amendment, and say no to these voices calling to infringe on a shall not infringe amendment.
[00:07:59.075 --> 00:08:01.418]  Aaron Dykes, signing off for InfoWars.com.
