[00:00:04.502 --> 00:00:07.505]  Hi, I'm Gigi Ornette with an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:12.209]  Here's what you might have missed during the incessant coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing.
[00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:22.277]  Yes, while that was going on, you might have missed the criminals in Washington making legal what they've been doing illegally for years, while eviscerating your Bill of Rights and stealing your hard-earned money.
[00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:24.766]  They're trying to pass CISPA.
[00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:27.727]  CISPA has been called the Patriot Act of the Internet.
[00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:32.410]  Here's some of the verbiage from CISPA, also known as H.R.
[00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.410]  624.
[00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.735]  It gives, quote, federal government and law enforcement the necessary tools to combat the current and emerging cyber threats facing the nation.
[00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:49.780]  Obama says he's going to veto CISPA because it violates privacy rights, but we all saw how that worked out with the NDAA.
[00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:57.169]  Right on cue for purveyors of the Hegelian dialectic, we have mainstream media news accounts being hacked.
[00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:01.891]  AP, 60 Minutes, and 48 Hours all claim to be victims of the hacks.
[00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:08.615]  Of course, CISPA will be touted as the solution, while we pay billions of dollars for them to spy on us.
[00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:11.156]  Take a look at the agencies involved with this.
[00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:16.420]  NASA, NSA, DARPA, NOAA, DHS, and many more.
[00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.042]  And here's a big conflict of interest.
[00:01:19.563 --> 00:01:25.467]  Senator Feinstein's husband will receive a multi-billion dollar contract when CISPA gets rolled out.
[00:01:26.108 --> 00:01:29.611]  Staying with the web, the Orwellian Marketplace Fairness Act.
[00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:34.815]  It forces business owners to pay sales tax on web sales to wherever they ship to.
[00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:42.581]  Ron Paul weighed in on the issue and said the internet tax mandate also violates the original purpose of the Commerce Clause.
[00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:53.931]  And finally this week in the White House, why does President Obama feel the need to push through an executive order for a Presidential Commission on Election Administration?
[00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:55.372]  Here's some of it.
[00:01:55.852 --> 00:01:58.935]  The commission shall be composed of not more than nine members
[00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:01.397]  Appointed by the President?
[00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:10.043]  Is he laying the groundwork for Michelle Obama or is he doing this as payback for Hillary when she took it for Benghazi?
