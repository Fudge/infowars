[00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:10.408]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:11.869]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.530]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:17.873]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:22.455]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:36.670]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.872]  It is Thursday, the 16th day of May, 2013, and we are going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:42.413]  Joseph Curl...
[00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:59.567]  White House correspondent and reporter for the Washington Times and DrugsReport.com will be joining us to give us his take on all the unfolding and exploding scandals.
[00:01:00.207 --> 00:01:05.773]  Then Kevin Booth has had Warner Brothers pick up his American Drug War II.
[00:01:05.893 --> 00:01:10.537]  I consulted and worked on American Drug War I, and this one gets into what the drug war is doing to children,
[00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:19.289]  And I'm told by people that have seen it, I haven't seen it yet, it's going to come out on, I think it's HBO, absolutely tear-jerking and really exposes the phony drug war.
[00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.752]  Again, I don't like drugs, folks, they destroy a lot of people.
[00:01:22.052 --> 00:01:27.759]  The drug war is meant to keep the prices up, to put money into the drug war for the big banks and others.
[00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.617]  Drugs should be not shown as sexy, but as loser-ish.
[00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:36.238]  Kevin Booth's going to be joining us, and his film actually does that.
[00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:45.802]  Larry Pinckney, founding Black Panther, their communications director of the original Black Panther Party, who saw all the COINTELPRO firsthand.
[00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:46.943]  He's here in Austin.
[00:01:46.963 --> 00:01:47.603]  We flew him in.
[00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:49.504]  He's being interviewed for an upcoming film.
[00:01:49.524 --> 00:01:52.686]  He's going to be in studio with us in the third hour today.
[00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.647]  So, Joseph Kurl, Kevin Booth, and Larry Pinckney today.
[00:01:56.468 --> 00:02:05.507]  That said, I told you that my gut told me that this Benghazi Gate thing, after I really saw it explode last week,
[00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:16.791]  And now the IRS gate and the spying gate and the harassment of the whistleblowers, the torture coming out of Benghazi, that's what's really serious.
[00:02:17.592 --> 00:02:27.760]  That report a month ago that was in the New York Times, but just in the back of the paper, that a congressional bipartisan committee found war crimes of George W. Bush and Obama.
[00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:30.126]  That's a big part of this.
[00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:31.267]  There's ongoing torture.
[00:02:31.307 --> 00:02:35.508]  In fact, Obama has expanded it according to all of our sources and evidence that's come out.
[00:02:36.048 --> 00:02:41.570]  I mean, they are torturing at more than a hundred sites around the world that are known.
[00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.012]  Thirty-something in Iraq, two in Guantanamo Bay.
[00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:50.753]  They have a big camp and another camp within it.
[00:02:51.073 --> 00:02:51.993]  Two sites there.
[00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:58.095]  They're torturing in Egypt and a bunch of sites in Romania, in Poland, in Ukraine.
[00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:04.079]  In Georgia, and in the United States, reportedly, and other locations.
[00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:05.604]  And it is hard core.
[00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:11.303]  And again, it is not, quote, real terrorists that are being tortured.
[00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:13.805]  It is people for fake confessions, you name it.
[00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:15.547]  You cannot believe a word.
[00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:27.778]  You know, it's like when our pilots would get shot down by Northern Vietnam and then a year later appear on North Vietnamese TV, you know, and film releases saying we're evil, we target civilians on purpose, you know, we drop this and that.
[00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:28.920]  A lot of it wasn't true.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.182]  Everybody knew you don't listen to that.
[00:03:31.242 --> 00:03:32.083]  It's not admissible.
[00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:34.897]  Because they admittedly use torture.
[00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:38.821]  They put you in a cage smaller than your body for a year.
[00:03:38.841 --> 00:03:43.487]  And by the way, everybody breaks, ends up saying whatever they want them to say.
[00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:48.312]  Most people would break in a few hours, buried alive, stuff like that.
[00:03:49.113 --> 00:03:51.836]  And that's what goes on at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:58.820]  That's what goes on at the camp within it, the CIA base.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.920]  That's what goes on at these places.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:14.184]  And some of these guys are so tough, like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, waterboarded hundreds of times, that he would not break and confess to things he hadn't done until they brought his kids in and started to go to work on them.
[00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:16.765]  And then he said, look, I'll say whatever you want.
[00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:19.377]  I'll say whatever you want.
[00:04:20.018 --> 00:04:24.960]  And he confessed to bombing buildings that were built four years after he was in custody.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.701]  He was in custody seven years before he broke.
[00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.983]  Seven years of torture.
[00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:41.506]  Seven... You say what you want about Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, whoever that double, triple agent really is, but tough as nails.
[00:04:45.087 --> 00:04:45.988]  Oh man, I tell ya.
[00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:47.535]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:47.555 --> 00:04:48.655]  We're going to get into all of it.
[00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:50.837]  This is big.
[00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:51.858]  This whole thing's big.
[00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:55.260]  It's all unraveling very, very quickly right now.
[00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:56.421]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:57.582]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:08.070]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:05:08.982 --> 00:05:14.888]  At Silverlungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[00:06:30.998 --> 00:06:31.418]  I think so.
[00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:04.780]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.584]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[00:08:09.596 --> 00:08:12.142]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:25.243]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 16th day of May, 2012.
[00:08:28.185 --> 00:08:32.328]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:43.416]  Joseph Curl, senior writer and White House correspondent for the Washington Times, also Drudge Researcher, DrudgeReport.com Researcher, will be popping in.
[00:08:44.497 --> 00:08:49.643]  At the bottom of the hour via the road via cell phone to give us the latest inside.
[00:08:49.743 --> 00:08:55.149]  He's got all the inside sources on how serious and how big all of this is.
[00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.997]  The word he gave me is it's going to be the IRS stuff and the spying that's going to probably bring down Obama.
[00:09:02.273 --> 00:09:03.114]  Not Benghazi.
[00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:04.535]  Now that's when I talked to him yesterday.
[00:09:04.915 --> 00:09:07.957]  We're going to see the latest info he's got at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:08.358 --> 00:09:14.482]  Kevin Booth has got his new American Drug War 2 being put out by Warner Brothers, coming out soon.
[00:09:15.203 --> 00:09:16.184]  Very powerful.
[00:09:16.244 --> 00:09:20.087]  I haven't seen it, but I've talked to people that have seen it, and there's not a dry eye in the house.
[00:09:20.107 --> 00:09:21.468]  It shows what the drug war does to kids.
[00:09:22.468 --> 00:09:34.274]  That is all coming up, and Larry Pinkney, former communications director for the original Black Panther Party, to talk about government dirty tricks and more, will be in studio with us.
[00:09:34.294 --> 00:09:37.115]  He's here to be interviewed for the Obama Deception Part 2.
[00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:38.355]  That's why he's in town.
[00:09:38.395 --> 00:09:39.436]  We flew him in yesterday.
[00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:40.716]  He got in last night.
[00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:43.738]  We've got new Boston bombing info.
[00:09:44.558 --> 00:09:48.280]  We've got amazing, the good, the bad, and the ugly on the Second Amendment front.
[00:09:49.537 --> 00:09:57.561]  We have Russian government putting in a war fleet in the Mediterranean in an escalation to Syria situation.
[00:09:57.641 --> 00:10:01.383]  Israel says they will bring down Assad and he retaliates for future airstrikes.
[00:10:01.403 --> 00:10:06.346]  It's like we're going to bomb you now and if you fight back in any way we're going to basically blow your whole country up.
[00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:07.626]  I think that's reasonable.
[00:10:07.827 --> 00:10:12.669]  I think Syria should be nuked and every man, woman and child killed and Al Qaeda should be put in charge.
[00:10:13.249 --> 00:10:15.771]  And I think Israel is right to be doing that.
[00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:18.197]  So there you go, I support Israel 110%.
[00:10:18.237 --> 00:10:20.417]  It's a little bit of satire there.
[00:10:20.457 --> 00:10:23.078]  I mean, it just shows how all these governments are completely out of control.
[00:10:24.299 --> 00:10:32.182]  And it's even in mainstream news now, like, I was on some of the Israeli news sites and the people there are going, why are we putting Al-Qaeda in there?
[00:10:32.242 --> 00:10:33.202]  Why are we doing this?
[00:10:33.242 --> 00:10:35.483]  I mean, Assad's not doing anything to us.
[00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:37.204]  I mean, I'm not a fan of Assad, but...
[00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:47.026]  The Jews in Israel, in the Jerusalem Post and Harots and all the others in Times of Israel, go read the comments.
[00:10:47.807 --> 00:10:52.675]  About half of them are going, what on earth is going on here?
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.981]  What is happening here?
[00:10:57.061 --> 00:11:02.903]  So even the Israelis don't like what's happening and going on on that front.
[00:11:02.923 --> 00:11:04.824]  We're going to be getting to all of that.
[00:11:05.244 --> 00:11:14.067]  But when I talk about rats leaving the sinking ship, when I talk about things like that,
[00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:27.076]  I'm here on air, it's a Thursday radio broadcast, and I'm about to go live a few minutes ago, and I think to myself, what do I cover first in this scandal?
[00:11:29.377 --> 00:11:30.338]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:35.202]  I figured that you would see more of a Benghazi whitewash.
[00:11:36.023 --> 00:11:42.308]  Because if the Republicans got into the open lies, where the system has been caught red-handed,
[00:11:45.492 --> 00:12:00.104]  Covering up, ordering a stand-down, their own security force attacking the facility, the stand-down, the fact that they got caught lying about the stand-down, now they've put out selected emails to try to cover their trail and say that they knew nothing.
[00:12:03.007 --> 00:12:09.052]  If the Republicans went with that, which they never do, because they don't want to bring down the whole system because they're so tied into it,
[00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:14.541]  If they went into any areas of truth on Benghazi, it would bring down Obama.
[00:12:14.841 --> 00:12:21.763]  So I said, I don't expect them, and I'm rarely wrong, and I was wrong last week, last Wednesday with the testimony, or was it Tuesday?
[00:12:22.123 --> 00:12:30.186]  I said, I don't expect them to really get into this, and they're just gonna say it was a screw-up, and they were incompetent, and try to score some political points.
[00:12:30.587 --> 00:12:37.009]  But because the witnesses bucked the gag orders and the threats, and went ahead and told the truth,
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:57.553]  This whole thing blew up in the establishment's face, and now Boehner and people that were basically, you know, involved in a giant whitewash, they are now being forced to talk about, you know, criminal investigations, arrest, an IRS gate, you name it.
[00:13:01.007 --> 00:13:07.313]  Because there's total credibility hemorrhaging going on right now and there's not much blood to run out of this thing left.
[00:13:07.713 --> 00:13:08.914]  The globalists are in shock.
[00:13:09.315 --> 00:13:09.975]  They're in trouble.
[00:13:10.336 --> 00:13:18.683]  This happens throughout history and so many times people just can't believe that a tyranny has a fall or that tyranny gets damaged.
[00:13:19.344 --> 00:13:23.669]  Tyranny is in serious trouble right now.
[00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:39.947]  It's flailing around, and if we intensify the attack, instead of standing back and watching the spectacle, if we just fire everything we've got at them politically, with the truth, and keep pounding, and keep discrediting, it's going to give other cowards in the media
[00:13:41.158 --> 00:13:52.243]  political cover who don't like what's been going on and who have a conscience, it's going to give them cover to have more of a swarm attack on the corrupt system.
[00:13:52.403 --> 00:13:57.606]  And if we get them on Benghazi and IRSgate and Spygate and all this, it's over folks.
[00:13:57.926 --> 00:13:59.406]  It will give other people courage.
[00:13:59.607 --> 00:14:01.527]  They've been trying to intimidate all the whistleblowers.
[00:14:02.588 --> 00:14:06.750]  Government's been coming down with both feet trying to shut down any opposition to corruption.
[00:14:07.964 --> 00:14:09.945]  They've been trying to have a reign of intimidation.
[00:14:10.445 --> 00:14:19.829]  And the minute that dam breaks, which is starting to happen, it will cause a flood that could really bring real reform to this country.
[00:14:20.369 --> 00:14:22.870]  But you're going to have to decide that you have power.
[00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.571]  You're going to have to decide, I'm not even talking to our audience, they know that.
[00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:28.852]  I'm talking to mainstream media that listens to this show.
[00:14:29.613 --> 00:14:33.014]  You're going to have to decide that you don't want to be total mouthpieces anymore.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.384]  And you've also got to stop being so arrogant and still thinking that you're able to bamboozle the public.
[00:14:41.285 --> 00:14:42.206]  Because a lot of you are...
[00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.936]  sociopathic in your business dealings.
[00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:49.318]  You may not even be totally sociopathic, but you behave like sociopaths.
[00:14:49.699 --> 00:14:52.420]  And some of you are not just sociopaths, you're psychopaths.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:58.764]  But even a cold-blooded psychopath would not want to be involved with this new world order unless you have a death wish.
[00:14:59.284 --> 00:15:01.045]  And some of you are very, very dark.
[00:15:01.425 --> 00:15:07.269]  You're in love with darkness and you're enjoying the spectacle of globalism.
[00:15:07.729 --> 00:15:10.071]  But that's a very small percentage of people.
[00:15:10.111 --> 00:15:10.371]  Maybe
[00:15:11.653 --> 00:15:19.737]  Maybe one-tenth of one percent are really, really French kissing the devil and really know what they're into.
[00:15:20.177 --> 00:15:30.542]  Most of you are cowardly that serve evil and you recognize its power and so you think by embracing it you're going to get power when all you turn into is a chicken neck slave by serving it.
[00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:31.323]  Okay?
[00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:43.338]  And if you had good natures in you, you would have known that real power is in goodness, but that you wouldn't be good for the power sake.
[00:15:44.739 --> 00:15:46.961]  Because with great power comes great responsibility.
[00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:48.122]  But I'm going to stop preaching.
[00:15:50.709 --> 00:15:55.217]  I was initially wrong because I'm just so used to the system whitewashing everything.
[00:15:55.477 --> 00:15:56.338]  This is blown up.
[00:15:56.459 --> 00:15:57.620]  That testimony was real.
[00:15:57.961 --> 00:15:58.562]  It was epic.
[00:15:58.883 --> 00:16:01.747]  It was historical last Thursday, last Friday as all that broke.
[00:16:02.288 --> 00:16:02.829]  And now...
[00:16:04.212 --> 00:16:08.214]  The power structure is in major damage control.
[00:16:08.254 --> 00:16:26.023]  They may stage new wars, they may stage new terror attacks, and even if they did something giant, the cat is out of the bag, the genie's out of the bottle, the horse left the stable, the train left the station, Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall, and all the king's horses, all the king's men aren't going to put it back together again.
[00:16:26.384 --> 00:16:28.645]  It is the best of times, the worst of times.
[00:16:30.043 --> 00:16:37.170]  It was a time of great knowledge and of incredible foolhardiness, to paraphrase A Tale of Two Cities.
[00:16:38.252 --> 00:16:42.376]  You guys actually print me or put up on screen the opening of A Tale of Two Cities.
[00:16:42.396 --> 00:16:44.558]  I don't want to butcher that citation.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.763]  The issue here is it is the best of times, the worst of times.
[00:16:48.983 --> 00:16:50.044]  That's how the universe works.
[00:16:50.324 --> 00:16:52.547]  As great evil rises, great good rises.
[00:16:54.019 --> 00:16:56.984]  For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:16:57.024 --> 00:16:58.105]  It's quantum mechanics.
[00:16:58.626 --> 00:17:00.209]  But all the ancients knew this.
[00:17:00.789 --> 00:17:08.902]  And so, as evil tries to take over, it actually opens windows for good to come in and shift the script.
[00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:11.541]  There it is.
[00:17:12.501 --> 00:17:13.681]  It was the best of times.
[00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:14.822]  It was the worst of times.
[00:17:14.862 --> 00:17:16.022]  It was the age of wisdom.
[00:17:16.342 --> 00:17:17.862]  It was the age of foolishness.
[00:17:18.602 --> 00:17:20.183]  It was the epoch of belief.
[00:17:20.403 --> 00:17:22.883]  It was the epoch of incredulity.
[00:17:23.703 --> 00:17:24.943]  It was the season of light.
[00:17:24.983 --> 00:17:26.164]  It was the season of darkness.
[00:17:26.784 --> 00:17:27.944]  It was the spring of hope.
[00:17:27.984 --> 00:17:29.364]  It was the winter of despair.
[00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.144]  We had everything before us.
[00:17:31.404 --> 00:17:32.525]  We had nothing before us.
[00:17:33.165 --> 00:17:35.765]  We were all going direct to heaven.
[00:17:36.085 --> 00:17:38.746]  We were all going direct to hell.
[00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:40.146]  Oh, man!
[00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:42.389]  Ooh, the classics.
[00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.113]  I mean, does that not say everything right there?
[00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:54.242]  Ooh, I mean, how could anybody not be incredibly energized right now?
[00:17:56.227 --> 00:18:21.997]  But the minute I saw those deputy ambassadors, the minute I saw the head of anti-terrorism for the State Department, the minute I saw them with tears in their eyes, but steel in their jaws, and the courage to tell the truth, and the minute I saw the goosebumps on their skin, and I saw that, just like you can see it on me right now, the minute they stepped into the truth,
[00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:26.226]  It was like an electrical charge connected and I went, whoa, I was wrong.
[00:18:26.526 --> 00:18:28.488]  This is the fall of Obama if you want it.
[00:18:29.008 --> 00:18:30.469]  But it's more than the fall of Obama.
[00:18:30.569 --> 00:18:32.170]  It is a chink in the armor.
[00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:37.793]  Take that crowbar and just rip it in and reach in there to the heart of the New World Order.
[00:18:38.634 --> 00:18:39.254]  Tear it out.
[00:18:40.095 --> 00:18:41.736]  Because I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:18:42.796 --> 00:18:44.356]  People don't believe they have power.
[00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:45.777]  They don't believe the great can fall.
[00:18:46.037 --> 00:18:59.399]  They believe these crooks in government with their con man confidence game, facade of false chutzpah, bravado, machismo, aplomb, whatever you want to call it, it is just that.
[00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:01.420]  It is a facade.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.680]  They are scared.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.001]  They live lives of fear and insecurity.
[00:19:11.823 --> 00:19:13.684]  Now, here's what I'm talking about.
[00:19:14.185 --> 00:19:23.651]  They excise two days of the emails, and there's emails in there, in this fake data leak they've done to cover up Benghazi and act like they didn't do anything, with Petraeus saying, I don't like what you've done.
[00:19:23.711 --> 00:19:24.552]  That's why they got rid of him.
[00:19:25.692 --> 00:19:27.394]  Just as our sources said back in October.
[00:19:27.734 --> 00:19:28.935]  Wow, they were all on target.
[00:19:30.676 --> 00:19:35.699]  And now you've got congressmen saying the Justice Department cloakroom was wiretapped.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:37.881]  Yeah, that's what
[00:19:40.723 --> 00:19:42.925]  Senators and people are saying a lot more is about to come out.
[00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:44.706]  And you've got rats running.
[00:19:45.827 --> 00:19:51.751]  We've got slimeball Chris Matthews saying he doesn't like Obama anymore.
[00:19:52.251 --> 00:19:55.254]  And you've got absolute minion Bill Press saying it.
[00:19:55.694 --> 00:20:00.337]  I mean, that is the signal that the rodents are running in fear.
[00:20:00.597 --> 00:20:01.558]  This is the end of Obama.
[00:20:01.598 --> 00:20:06.822]  American gardeners and fellow patriots, make the right choice with your money, time, and your family food supply.

[00:21:02.506 --> 00:21:08.351]  For nearly 20 years, Alex has been the voice of warning on threatening issues that the big media won't dare talk about.
[00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:10.352]  Threats that trample the American dream.
[00:21:10.613 --> 00:21:12.274]  You know what we all face.
[00:21:12.514 --> 00:21:16.137]  A crashing economy that's forcing millions out of work and from their homes.
[00:21:16.357 --> 00:21:19.159]  Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.882]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.

[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.562]  The Pure Gannic Companion, the preventative maintenance manual for the human body.
[00:22:30.441 --> 00:22:39.727]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:39.767 --> 00:22:40.508]  This capitalism?
[00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:46.712]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:47.612]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:47.632 --> 00:22:50.735]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:22:50.795 --> 00:22:51.695]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.715 --> 00:22:52.776]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:22:52.796 --> 00:22:53.056]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.116 --> 00:22:53.456]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.621 --> 00:23:02.662]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[00:23:03.023 --> 00:23:16.010]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[00:23:17.071 --> 00:23:18.753]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:23:18.994 --> 00:23:21.156]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[00:23:21.196 --> 00:23:27.304]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:23:27.624 --> 00:23:35.655]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:23:36.195 --> 00:23:41.677]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:23:41.897 --> 00:23:48.759]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:23:48.819 --> 00:23:49.179]  That's 877-532-5388.
[00:23:49.239 --> 00:23:50.200]  Or go to faketv.com.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.000]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:24:14.008 --> 00:24:16.843]  So, Bill Press, the globalist minion...
[00:24:18.443 --> 00:24:26.767]  ...has now come out and said that Obama is just horrible, basically, and that Attorney General Eric Holder should step down.
[00:24:27.647 --> 00:24:44.714]  The Atlantic Wire, that is basically the official White House, one of its official White House propaganda organs, is calling for Holder's head, or saying it's imminent, that he's going to have to step down after his, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I'm not a crook, Nixon 2.0.
[00:24:46.826 --> 00:24:47.987]  Or Nixon squared.
[00:24:48.007 --> 00:24:55.054]  You've got the guy that said he gets excited, tingle up his leg into his groin area when he hears Obama talk.
[00:24:56.235 --> 00:24:57.697]  That's pretty disgusting imagining.
[00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:00.751]  Slimeball and Obama hanging out.
[00:25:01.771 --> 00:25:03.092]  He says he doesn't get the tingle anymore.
[00:25:03.832 --> 00:25:04.672]  So there you go.
[00:25:04.752 --> 00:25:09.134]  He does not get aroused when watching and listening to Obama.
[00:25:10.054 --> 00:25:11.195]  So there you go.
[00:25:12.175 --> 00:25:22.259]  And that's kind of the meter, the canary in the coal mine, is that Chris Matthews is not aroused in his groin region when Obama is on television.
[00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:22.620]  That's it.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.141]  I mean, that's kind of like the cooking timer.
[00:25:25.201 --> 00:25:25.581]  Ding!
[00:25:26.281 --> 00:25:28.982]  All right, Chris Matthews does not want to date Obama anymore.
[00:25:30.042 --> 00:25:32.683]  It's all, or whatever it means to have a tingle up your leg.
[00:25:33.683 --> 00:25:36.844]  I don't, pretty much everybody thinks that means we're twinkle in the eye.
[00:25:37.564 --> 00:25:44.246]  I don't know what, I mean I have a little bit of humor here because this is so out of control, but of course the NSA and Justice Department is tapping Congress.
[00:25:44.786 --> 00:25:49.127]  They've caught MI6 and MI5 tapping Parliament in England.
[00:25:49.167 --> 00:25:52.708]  This is the illegitimate bureaucracy tapping the real government.
[00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.311]  The bureaucracy tells Congress they can't see the Homeland Security Directives.
[00:25:57.991 --> 00:26:01.652]  They tell the Homeland Security Committee, you can't see PDD 51.
[00:26:02.152 --> 00:26:04.493]  You can't see our orders for civil unrest.
[00:26:05.613 --> 00:26:07.213]  That's dictatorship right there, folks.
[00:26:07.654 --> 00:26:12.835]  The central government is now run by foreign interests that control the President, and they're out of control.
[00:26:13.075 --> 00:26:21.217]  But the routing of these people has begun, and here is the Congressman Devin Nunes on a radio show.
[00:26:22.512 --> 00:26:23.893]  I don't trust the Department of Justice on this.
[00:26:23.913 --> 00:26:24.933]  Do you, Congressman Nunes?
[00:26:44.368 --> 00:26:51.513]  No, I absolutely do not, especially after this wiretapping incident, essentially, of the House of Representatives.
[00:26:52.014 --> 00:26:57.198]  I don't think people are focusing on the right thing when they talk about going after the AP reporters.
[00:26:57.758 --> 00:27:02.822]  The big problem that I see is that they actually tapped right where I'm sitting right now.
[00:27:03.062 --> 00:27:05.544]  Wait a minute, this is news to me.
[00:27:05.804 --> 00:27:07.345]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:27:07.785 --> 00:27:18.494]  So, when they went after the AP reporters, right, went after all of their phone records, they went after the phone records including right up here in the House gallery, right up from where I'm sitting right now.
[00:27:19.114 --> 00:27:29.703]  So, you have a real separation of powers issue here that, you know, did this really rise to the level that you would have to get phone records that would most likely include members of Congress?
[00:27:29.723 --> 00:27:32.184]  Because as you know, members of Congress talk to the press all the time.
[00:27:32.204 --> 00:27:32.425]  Wow!
[00:27:32.525 --> 00:27:35.027]  I did not know that, and that is a stunner.
[00:27:36.112 --> 00:27:41.975]  It's a separation of powers issue and it's a freedom of press issue and now you've got the IRS going after people.
[00:27:42.015 --> 00:27:50.580]  So these things are starting to cascade one upon the other and you have the White House pretending like they're in the clouds, like it's not their issue somehow.
[00:27:52.424 --> 00:27:56.067]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen, and that was Hugh Hewitt's radio show.
[00:27:56.087 --> 00:27:56.947]  I think I've been on that show.
[00:27:57.508 --> 00:27:59.949]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.111]  And this is what Mitch McConnell said last week.
[00:28:03.452 --> 00:28:05.933]  And on Sunday, he said, a lot more is coming out.
[00:28:06.013 --> 00:28:08.115]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:28:08.135 --> 00:28:09.636]  We've got to come back with that liner.
[00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:11.157]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:28:11.417 --> 00:28:12.538]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby.
[00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:14.199]  No, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:16.480]  And we could sit here and joke around about this.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.042]  This is very, very serious.
[00:28:18.082 --> 00:28:20.903]  Speaking of joking around, more and more people
[00:28:21.824 --> 00:28:28.626]  Who have not been politically active other than through their satire, like Mike Judge, are speaking out against the New World Order, against things going on.
[00:28:29.326 --> 00:28:36.448]  And that's what it's going to take is all of you that have been silent in power positions, or just out there upon the fruited plain, all of us have power.
[00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:38.529]  We've got to say no to this system.
[00:28:38.769 --> 00:28:41.270]  We've got to raise our voices against it.
[00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:54.253]  I've talked to Mike Judge for years, you know, off and on, off the telephone and text messages and things, but we've always both been busy and I've never really bugged him, so we never hung out, but I hung out quite a bit with him this week, Monday and Tuesday, did a big interview with him.
[00:28:54.293 --> 00:28:55.473]  It's about 50 minutes long.
[00:28:55.753 --> 00:29:03.615]  We're going to premiere it, shot it at his house in high def video next Thursday here on the radio slash TV show, and it's going to be a news-making interview.
[00:29:03.995 --> 00:29:05.816]  A lot of it's about him growing up and
[00:29:07.637 --> 00:29:10.359]  But also, Second Amendment, things like that, it's pretty powerful.
[00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:17.145]  So I want to take you out here with Hank Hill and Beavis and Butthead via the one, the only Mike Judge.
[00:29:17.205 --> 00:29:17.705]  Here it is.
[00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:28.594]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.

[00:33:26.644 --> 00:33:28.586]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:29.087 --> 00:33:31.369]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.872]  Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:33:33.932 --> 00:33:34.192]  Eastern.
[00:33:34.712 --> 00:33:36.234]  It's Infowars.com.
[00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:40.158]  And yours truly, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:43.281]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:34:07.758]  All right, folks, we are joined by Joseph Curl, political correspondent, White House reporter for The Washington Times, broken some of the biggest stories in the last 20 years politically, and that's why he also is one of the heavy hitters, the few, the proud, the drudges, over at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:34:07.798 --> 00:34:08.519]  Who can say that?
[00:34:09.319 --> 00:34:12.482]  Not, not, not many, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:27.608]  And I intro'd this with, you ain't seen nothing yet, because when you have Congressman Devin Nunes coming out and saying, look, they were spying on the cloakroom and Congress, and that's a separation of powers violation.
[00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:32.231]  Well, yeah, can you imagine if the Congress was spying on the White House with illegal wiretaps?
[00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:34.733]  And he's like, does that rise to impeachment?
[00:34:35.433 --> 00:34:40.816]  I don't know, does Charlie Manchin cutting babies out of Sharon Tate's stomach rise to murder?
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:55.132]  It's just, it's like, well, it is the president, you know, maybe he's allowed to, I mean, even the, even the Republicans cannot get hardcore with things that are just out in the open because our normalcy bias is to accept anything.
[00:34:55.152 --> 00:34:58.015]  It's like we have mass Stockholm syndrome.
[00:34:58.055 --> 00:34:58.935]  But, but let me tell you.
[00:34:59.736 --> 00:35:24.640]  Political catastrophe, political Waterloo, political rigor mortis is setting in to the Obama administration with, I don't know, I don't remember, I know nothing, I'm Sergeant Schultz from Hogan's Heroes, with all of them, they're being caught lying on Benghazi, the IRS spying, the whistleblower persecutions, the wiretapping, all of it, they're in deep trouble.
[00:35:25.711 --> 00:35:36.174]  And that's why you've got Bill Press saying, you know, the Attorney General needs to step down, and Obama, and Chris Matthews says his leg doesn't get the tingle up into his, you know, groin anymore over this.
[00:35:36.254 --> 00:35:38.715]  And all of these people are running scared.
[00:35:38.995 --> 00:35:44.917]  The Atlantic Wire, that basically is a White House organ, says, is the end of the Eric Holder's tenure at the Justice Department.
[00:35:45.817 --> 00:35:47.397]  It's not enough to throw him under the bus.
[00:35:47.697 --> 00:35:49.178]  Not enough to go, all of them,
[00:35:49.963 --> 00:35:51.104]  Okay, they need to go to jail.
[00:35:51.844 --> 00:35:56.466]  These guys make Nixon look like an angel compared to the things they've done and what they've been caught doing.
[00:35:56.746 --> 00:36:04.350]  And joining us is Joseph Curl of TheWashingtonTimes.com and DrudgeReport.com, the guy who really has the inside scoop.
[00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:05.510]  Will it be Benghazi?
[00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.571]  Will it be IRS gay?
[00:36:06.851 --> 00:36:07.872]  Will it be spy gay?
[00:36:07.912 --> 00:36:09.092]  Will it be intimidation gay?
[00:36:09.332 --> 00:36:11.033]  Will it be perjury gay?
[00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:12.734]  Will it be, uh...
[00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:15.115]  I mean, can we bring back Fast and Furious now?
[00:36:15.695 --> 00:36:17.376]  Will this bring down Obama?
[00:36:17.796 --> 00:36:19.516]  And what do you expect him to try to do to stop it?
[00:36:19.536 --> 00:36:24.798]  What is the inside intel directly from the belly of the beast, the District of Criminals Joe Curl?
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.200]  Hey, Alex.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:28.820]  Hey, buddy.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:39.924]  The most fascinating thing that's been happening so far, the thing that really intrigues me out of this whole, now this is a criminal message, but as you mentioned, Fast and Furious is still hanging out there.
[00:36:39.944 --> 00:36:41.665]  We've never really gotten any answers on that.
[00:36:42.537 --> 00:36:48.861]  The most amazing thing, and it just keeps happening, is the lack of accountability from the administration.
[00:36:48.921 --> 00:36:56.825]  It's really, you know, my buddy over at the Washington Post, Dana Milbank, wrote today that the holders seemed almost proud to not know anything.
[00:36:56.865 --> 00:37:09.913]  You know, what you've got over in the Justice Department now is he recused himself from this whole AP, you know, seizing the phone records of the Associated Press, and he literally sat in front of the Congressman and just said, I don't know anything.
[00:37:10.618 --> 00:37:15.001]  I mean, he was calling in front of Congress, and then he said for four hours, I don't know anything.
[00:37:15.021 --> 00:37:21.966]  And then you've got Hillary, she's not involved in, doesn't know anything about Benghazigate.
[00:37:22.666 --> 00:37:35.115]  You've got, you know, now we're hearing that the White House is trying to spin the whole IRS mess as a couple of low-level guys in Cincinnati who were just rogue operators who were doing something nobody knows anything.
[00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:48.024]  The weirdest thing, and I was talking to my dad the other night about, he remembers all the way back to Eisenhower and Truman, and he was saying, you know, Terry Truman had a big placard on his desk that said, The Buck Stops Here.
[00:37:48.044 --> 00:37:54.031]  Right now, we don't know where this buck stops, but what Obama keeps saying is, it sure as heck doesn't stop at me.
[00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:56.971]  Well, we know where the buck stops.
[00:37:57.031 --> 00:38:01.472]  I mean, Obama gets his orders from the big unions, from the big foreign banks.
[00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:05.153]  He gets his orders from basically the Socialists, the Communist Party.
[00:38:05.753 --> 00:38:08.134]  He gets his orders from the big tax-free foundations.
[00:38:08.174 --> 00:38:10.374]  I mean, he gets his orders from the heirs.
[00:38:12.195 --> 00:38:12.475]  Right.
[00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:16.876]  And they're spending all of their time and effort
[00:38:17.836 --> 00:38:31.166]  You know, I think it's not ludicrous to start talking about Richard Nixon, because this is the classic, and I wrote a column about this a couple of weeks ago in the Washington Times, the classic conundrum of the second term.
[00:38:31.206 --> 00:38:39.232]  These guys all get in messes, all the way back to Eisenhower, you know, with the U-2, and then you've had, you know, Reagan had a Ron Contra.
[00:38:39.632 --> 00:38:47.078]  Clinton, of course, had Monica Miller-Lee, and you had Bush, who had his own problems and messes going on, and now you've got
[00:38:47.702 --> 00:38:49.402]  Now you've got Obama with this.
[00:38:49.962 --> 00:38:59.965]  The biggest problem and the way you can talk about Nixon in the same breath as Obama, even though these things are just starting, is it's all a cover-up.
[00:39:00.025 --> 00:39:03.825]  The cover-up of how they deal with the information once it's out there.
[00:39:03.845 --> 00:39:16.828]  We're starting to hear weird little things that, you know, this IRS stuff was actually known years ago within the IRS and weeks ago at the White House, but nothing ever really came out of it until right before
[00:39:17.918 --> 00:39:18.378]  I don't know.
[00:39:35.649 --> 00:39:38.892]  You know, this is an administration that hasn't really had any scandals.
[00:39:38.952 --> 00:39:41.955]  All of a sudden, they've got three scandals going at the same time.
[00:39:42.195 --> 00:39:47.199]  And I think I sent you a message the other day saying, you know, Benghazi is the big one.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:56.608]  And it wouldn't surprise me if they had these scandals hanging around, and they just dumped them out to try and storm the real scandal, which is Benghazi.
[00:39:57.864 --> 00:40:06.608]  Yeah, and then we talked on the phone, you said Benghazi is the big one, but you were saying, at least a few days ago, you expect the IRS deal to be the one that actually could bring them down.
[00:40:07.709 --> 00:40:13.671]  Yeah, well, I mean, that's the one that really crosses over, you know, that does get right into Nixonian stuff.
[00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:15.512]  That's what Nixon was doing.
[00:40:15.552 --> 00:40:19.134]  Nixon was using the IRS to literally target his enemy.
[00:40:19.774 --> 00:40:21.515]  He was telling the IRS to go out and get my enemy.
[00:40:24.412 --> 00:40:28.616]  Now, you know, the real question is going to be, where does this come down on?
[00:40:28.776 --> 00:40:36.843]  And, you know, guys, presidents have gotten better and better at pausing with the liability and not leaving any fingerprints on anything.
[00:40:37.183 --> 00:40:40.186]  So the question is, will this ever be traceable back to Obama?
[00:40:40.987 --> 00:40:43.429]  And the answer is probably not.
[00:40:44.193 --> 00:40:56.002]  The thing that's most striking to me is, you know, this is a culture now, a culture of corruption that's endemic to this administration and administration-wide.
[00:40:56.062 --> 00:40:58.924]  I mean, we're seeing it across all these different agencies.
[00:40:59.545 --> 00:41:07.351]  You know, when you have the Justice Department coming in and saying, I don't know what's happening, you have the Attorney General saying, I don't know what's going on in my own building.
[00:41:07.971 --> 00:41:10.392]  I don't know what happened that night in Benghazi.
[00:41:10.432 --> 00:41:11.092]  You've got the IRS.
[00:41:11.132 --> 00:41:12.512]  We don't know what happened.
[00:41:12.532 --> 00:41:14.133]  The President doesn't know what happened.
[00:41:14.593 --> 00:41:15.793]  Nobody seems to know what's going on.
[00:41:24.176 --> 00:41:26.998]  Well, by the way, Joseph Kurl, they have a new witness.
[00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:34.384]  Hillary and Eric Holder and all of them announced they're going to have a special spokesman now testifying for them.
[00:41:34.544 --> 00:41:36.606]  And he's going to come on the show with us right now.
[00:41:36.646 --> 00:41:39.708]  This is the White House's statement on any further scandals.
[00:41:40.709 --> 00:41:41.910]  Oh, I see nothing.
[00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.331]  I was not here.
[00:41:43.571 --> 00:41:46.153]  I did not even get up this morning.
[00:41:47.754 --> 00:41:48.715]  So there you go.
[00:41:48.755 --> 00:41:50.937]  That's the new White House press secretary.
[00:41:54.236 --> 00:41:58.498]  Well, it was really shocking yesterday.
[00:41:58.578 --> 00:42:05.340]  I loved that CNN and MSNBC, they were still doing their OJ reports and their little light-hearted things.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:12.022]  And here you've got the Attorney General testifying saying, I don't know what's happening in the Department of Justice.
[00:42:12.482 --> 00:42:13.702]  I don't know what's going on there.
[00:42:13.842 --> 00:42:15.383]  I had it, but I have no idea what's happened.
[00:42:15.703 --> 00:42:19.505]  And by the way, as you know, just over the weekend they were arrogant saying it's no big deal.
[00:42:19.746 --> 00:42:22.027]  Democrats were defending it on MSNBC.
[00:42:22.307 --> 00:42:23.868]  Good, we need to persecute Tea Parties.
[00:42:24.228 --> 00:42:27.410]  Now they've just sacked the IRS Commissioner today.
[00:42:27.871 --> 00:42:39.298]  Now Democrats, what does it signify to have Chris Matthews of Slimeball, to have Bill Press, to have all of the Atlantic Wire running from Obama and Holder right now?
[00:42:39.658 --> 00:42:41.239]  Are we seeing the beginning of a rout?
[00:42:41.539 --> 00:42:43.541]  What is the atmosphere there in DC?
[00:42:45.134 --> 00:42:48.455]  Well, that's another fascinating part of it.
[00:42:49.255 --> 00:42:57.818]  Whatever I think of the media and what they did in the second re-election campaign, the coverage that Obama got.
[00:42:58.178 --> 00:43:01.859]  I mean, remember, we had unemployment hovering around 8.5%.
[00:43:01.899 --> 00:43:04.720]  The economy is terrible.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.681]  Everything that Obamacare is going to be a nightmare.
[00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:20.651]  Everything that was happening really should have been, you know, failed for a president trying to get re-elected, but the media was the one that, you know, unified behind Obama to continue to sell him.
[00:43:20.812 --> 00:43:34.983]  I think what is beginning to happen right now is the media is starting to look at this president and go and say collectively, boy, we backed a big-time loser, and if we don't get off this guy pretty soon, we're all going to go down with him.
[00:43:36.568 --> 00:43:42.214]  You know, I would like to say that Bush's presidency was the worst ever.
[00:43:42.234 --> 00:43:44.236]  It certainly wasn't.
[00:43:44.316 --> 00:43:49.421]  And I think we might really, literally be looking at one of the worst presidencies in the last several years.
[00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:52.604]  I mean, we're going to end up, right now the recession is longer.
[00:43:53.507 --> 00:43:54.949]  Could you say this is the unknown future?
[00:44:08.387 --> 00:44:11.249]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:44:39.947 --> 00:44:54.552]  Well, that's what's been really interesting to me, and I think you tried to do a message on the IRS, thinking that was a really big one, but it was before I really started to think about the way this is going to play out, and we're seeing it play out right now.
[00:44:54.592 --> 00:44:59.174]  I mean, yesterday, Obama was trying to look like the take-charge guy.
[00:44:59.194 --> 00:45:06.396]  He makes it sound like he's just heard about this, even though we're hearing that he actually knew about it for several weeks in the White House.
[00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:20.533]  So, what he does is he comes on TV, yes, last night, and he says that he asked his Treasury Secretary to request the resignation from the IRS head.
[00:45:20.553 --> 00:45:23.674]  Now, the IRS head, he's only the acting head of the IRS.
[00:45:23.694 --> 00:45:27.735]  He's only been in there for a while, and his term was ending in June anyway.
[00:45:28.385 --> 00:45:31.607]  So, I wasn't really thinking how this thing plays out.
[00:45:31.668 --> 00:45:37.692]  So, what you have there is you've got a low-level, do-nothing guy who's not really responsible for this.
[00:45:38.272 --> 00:45:40.054]  He now loses his job.
[00:45:40.314 --> 00:45:49.521]  And they're going to end up fobbing the rest of this stuff off on these rogue IRS agents in Cincinnati.
[00:45:49.561 --> 00:45:51.582]  So, that scandal is going to come and go.
[00:45:51.722 --> 00:45:52.263]  And you've got
[00:45:53.823 --> 00:46:07.426]  On the phone records scandal, you're basically going to have, I mean, maybe this Deputy Attorney General will be canned over at the Department of Justice, but Eric Holder's going to, it looks like right now, stay above this whole fray.
[00:46:08.106 --> 00:46:13.988]  I doubt that Obama's going to kill his good buddy over there and let him go.
[00:46:14.972 --> 00:46:26.099]  So, these things will play out for several more months, but in the end, we're probably just going to have some lower-level guys fall on their swords and disappear, and that's what's starting to make me wonder if...
[00:46:26.846 --> 00:46:31.770]  This isn't all there to obscure Benghazi.
[00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:33.151]  No, but I tend to agree with you.
[00:46:33.171 --> 00:46:34.051]  I mean, that's when we talk on the phone.
[00:46:34.071 --> 00:46:39.315]  That's what I think is going on, is Benghazi, there was a stand-down.
[00:46:39.335 --> 00:46:41.137]  A bunch of the military were there and witnessed it.
[00:46:41.577 --> 00:46:44.659]  Now they're putting out selective emails with two-day gaps.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.341]  I agree with you.
[00:46:46.581 --> 00:46:49.523]  It's Benghazi that is really what they're afraid of.
[00:46:50.144 --> 00:46:51.064]  What's the word on that?
[00:46:51.104 --> 00:46:52.305]  Are they going to get away with that as well?
[00:46:52.725 --> 00:46:54.247]  Or will they politically
[00:46:54.887 --> 00:47:02.626]  Be destroyed and be a total lame duck now, but criminally get away with it and just kind of drift into the future?
[00:47:04.496 --> 00:47:11.780]  Yeah, I do think, I mean, you know, remember that that was more than six months ago, on September 11, 2012.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:32.049]  So, the media couldn't care less about that story until the Weekly Standards, Stephen Hayes, pulled all that stuff up and threw that out there, you know, about the emails and about the, you know, who was saying what at the time, about the video and about the spontaneous demonstration, which never, you know, neither of those were ever involved.
[00:47:33.883 --> 00:47:42.487]  The really interesting thing is going to be, that's what I've been noticing, is how do they change this subject from Benghazi?
[00:47:42.507 --> 00:47:45.089]  Because Benghazi is reaching critical mass now.
[00:47:45.509 --> 00:47:46.950]  So how do we get off Benghazi?
[00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:52.112]  Well, let's throw them a couple of scandals that will really consume Washington.
[00:47:52.233 --> 00:47:58.756]  And Washington, far more interested in the IRS scandal, because they're newer, and the phone scandal.
[00:47:59.902 --> 00:48:01.122]  Then they are in Benghazi.
[00:48:01.242 --> 00:48:15.625]  And then the last thing that's fascinating is the White House, you know, they have—they don't know anything about—you know, the White House spokesman doesn't know anything about the APD phone scandal and pushes that over to the Department of Justice.
[00:48:15.645 --> 00:48:19.406]  They're outraged over the IRS thing, and they're taking action on that.
[00:48:20.006 --> 00:48:23.767]  But on Benghazi, they dismissed it as just a political wish-on.
[00:48:24.622 --> 00:48:27.825]  And that, again, strikes me as that's what they want.
[00:48:27.885 --> 00:48:28.845]  Yeah, no, no.
[00:48:28.925 --> 00:48:37.232]  Their jihadis killed everybody and they ordered a stand-down and a bunch of missiles are missing and finally Fox News was covering that over the weekend.
[00:48:37.292 --> 00:48:43.317]  So, you know, my gut tells me, Joe Curley in Washington Times joining us, my gut tells me though that
[00:48:44.077 --> 00:48:48.560]  They'll be lucky if they're just politically destroyed and then powerless for three years.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.421]  But I don't even see that happening.
[00:48:50.942 --> 00:48:56.706]  I smell blood in the water, and I think even starting new wars is not going to politically get them out of this.
[00:48:57.086 --> 00:48:59.387]  I see a total loss of confidence in them.
[00:48:59.808 --> 00:49:06.392]  All the Democrats I know finally hate Obama and finally are apologizing to me for saying he's a crook.
[00:49:06.872 --> 00:49:09.995]  I mean, you're more of a journalist, so you stick to what you can 100% prove.
[00:49:10.375 --> 00:49:13.257]  I'm a journalist and a pundit, and I can say as a pundit,
[00:49:13.877 --> 00:49:18.980]  I think Obama is politically rotting.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:19.900]  What do you say to that?
[00:49:20.481 --> 00:49:22.702]  Well, I think that's absolutely right.
[00:49:22.922 --> 00:49:29.145]  I think, you know, there was question as to whether he was really ever going to get anything done.
[00:49:29.165 --> 00:49:35.068]  Because remember, he's the one who's created this poisonous atmosphere in Washington.
[00:49:35.108 --> 00:49:37.970]  He's the one who has literally spent four years
[00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:39.710]  We're good to go.
[00:50:07.737 --> 00:50:10.318]  Yeah, I thought Bush vacationed a lot.
[00:50:10.338 --> 00:50:16.559]  Obama's vacation is something like double what Bush did and seems completely disconnected and arrogant.
[00:50:34.204 --> 00:50:40.670]  Well, if you notice, and I'm sure your listeners have noticed, that has also been kind of the talking point that's been coming out of Washington.
[00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:48.056]  He's so bright, he's so intellectual, but he has this problem that Spock has of just being disengaged.
[00:50:48.597 --> 00:50:50.759]  He's not emotional because he is so intelligent.
[00:50:50.879 --> 00:50:54.862]  Tell you what, Joe Curl, The Washington Times and DrudgeReport.com, do six more minutes with us.
[00:50:55.242 --> 00:51:00.786]  On the other side, I want to come back and finish up this thought and ask, what's the other big scandals that Mitch McConnell talks about?
[00:51:01.026 --> 00:51:01.466]  What are those?
[00:51:20.999 --> 00:51:22.459]  As a backup water source.
[00:51:22.659 --> 00:51:33.643]  And you just can't beat a Big Berkey to remove dangerous chlorine, all types of fluoride, pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy byproducts from municipal water.
[00:51:33.783 --> 00:51:38.424]  Berkey water filter systems are even powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:15.460]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:52:17.657 --> 00:52:28.508]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit

[00:52:39.235 --> 00:52:40.036]  Others don't.

[00:52:58.959 --> 00:52:59.479]  Others don't.
[00:53:01.072 --> 00:53:05.174]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:53:05.834 --> 00:53:07.975]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:53:08.855 --> 00:53:17.219]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:22.761]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[00:53:57.598 --> 00:53:58.598]  Protect your immune system.
[00:53:58.879 --> 00:53:59.899]  It's the only one you've got.
[00:54:09.653 --> 00:54:16.741]  You know, I think the degeneration of Obama and how they try to sell all this collectivist tyranny is trendy.
[00:54:17.442 --> 00:54:20.125]  I just think there's a total collapse in confidence in it.
[00:54:20.806 --> 00:54:23.589]  And that's going to go for Republicans as well if they don't deliver liberty.
[00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:26.253]  That's why Ted Cruz is rising like a rocket.
[00:54:27.094 --> 00:54:29.336]  Rand Paul is rising because they're delivering.
[00:54:30.177 --> 00:54:35.801]  And the empty demonization, calling Ted Cruz a bully, calling Rand Paul a kook for pointing out the U.N.
[00:54:35.821 --> 00:54:37.141]  treaty, puts the U.N.
[00:54:37.182 --> 00:54:51.450]  over our guns, it isn't working anymore, and you were finishing up your Spock point, and then I wanted to ask you, what's the next big scandals on the radar and other tidbits, Joe Curl, of DrudgeReport.com and TheWashingtonTimes.com?
[00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:53.692]  What else do you expect to see?
[00:54:53.732 --> 00:54:58.335]  What other key nuggets would you like to reveal to the listeners?
[00:55:00.362 --> 00:55:07.672]  Well, I will tell you that, um, when I tweeted this out a couple of days ago, I have a person at the CIA who said, there's another shoe to drop.
[00:55:07.712 --> 00:55:09.435]  And I asked him, you mean there's a fourth shoe?
[00:55:09.475 --> 00:55:11.718]  And he said, yeah, at least a fourth shoe, maybe a fifth shoe.
[00:55:11.738 --> 00:55:13.660]  So there, there are things out there.
[00:55:13.721 --> 00:55:15.263]  I mean, I think you're, I think,
[00:55:16.832 --> 00:55:38.942]  It's not inconceivable that there will be something to this whole, you know, apparently the phone records that were subpoenaed not only had to do with the Associated Press, but had to do with their phone lines in various different places, including in the house, and including phone calls that may or may not have been made from the house cloakroom.
[00:55:38.982 --> 00:55:40.363]  Now, the house cloakroom is where
[00:55:41.303 --> 00:55:53.588]  You know, members of Congress, members of the House will go to really do the inside behind the scenes horse trading where they really talk about, they really talk far more candidly than they do on the floor.
[00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:55.077]  I think so.
[00:56:16.862 --> 00:56:25.368]  On bills and legislation, which is, again, a frightening cross over the First Amendment and constitutional rights.
[00:56:25.408 --> 00:56:27.890]  So, I think there's something there.
[00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:38.718]  I still think, you know, despite the fact that they want to dismiss it as a political witch hunt, and that's how they turn on everything, is that, oh, this is all just political.
[00:56:38.778 --> 00:56:41.660]  Well, everything's political, especially with this White House.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.261]  This White House makes everything political.
[00:56:44.016 --> 00:56:49.085]  So there's where we're going to see more information coming in.
[00:56:49.145 --> 00:56:52.591]  It was very smart of the White House yesterday to dump out those
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.581]  So almost three days, but the lapdog press isn't even pointing that out.
[00:56:55.661 --> 00:56:56.241]  They're going, see?
[00:56:56.281 --> 00:56:57.762]  This shows they didn't know anything!
[00:56:57.782 --> 00:56:57.862]  See?
[00:56:57.882 --> 00:56:58.402]  They are idiots!
[00:57:18.238 --> 00:57:30.725]  And see, that's also glorified by the White House that wants to do this, because when the GOP comes back and says, well, you know, hey, how about the rest of this information, they'll go, look, we're giving you what you—that's what Jay Carney likes to do.
[00:57:31.065 --> 00:57:36.448]  We've turned over thousands of documents, you know, and now you can tell it's a political wish-up, because it's never good enough.
[00:57:36.488 --> 00:57:38.269]  Whenever we turn over, it's never enough.
[00:57:40.711 --> 00:57:52.641]  Oh yeah, no, no.
[00:57:52.681 --> 00:57:55.043]  That's what Petraeus emails about.
[00:57:55.443 --> 00:57:57.825]  He goes, I don't like the talking point, the narrative I've been given.
[00:57:58.185 --> 00:57:58.886]  It's not true.
[00:57:59.106 --> 00:58:00.567]  So they even left that in there.
[00:58:00.607 --> 00:58:01.848]  Maybe they're lazy or stupid.
[00:58:02.048 --> 00:58:04.430]  This is such a cheap, such a cheap trick though.
[00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:07.193]  I mean, this would be like if I was going out of a parking garage and they wanted my
[00:58:07.961 --> 00:58:08.441]  I don't think so.
[00:58:30.233 --> 00:58:30.473]  Thank you.
[00:58:30.493 --> 00:58:30.814]  We'll see you.
[00:58:30.834 --> 00:58:31.655]  There goes Joseph Curl.
[00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:32.396]  Great guy.
[00:58:32.456 --> 00:58:32.957]  Great reporter.
[00:58:33.237 --> 00:58:33.598]  All right.
[00:58:33.638 --> 00:58:36.021]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:38.885]  A ton of news inside the drug war and more.
[00:58:38.925 --> 00:58:44.252]  Stay with us.
[00:58:44.272 --> 00:58:48.017]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.474 --> 00:58:58.457]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:58:58.697 --> 00:59:16.323]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:59:16.583 --> 00:59:20.685]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:59:20.965 --> 00:59:22.546]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:30.571]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:59:30.892 --> 00:59:37.156]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:59:37.216 --> 00:59:38.257]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:59:38.477 --> 00:59:39.217]  It's incredible.

[01:00:06.155 --> 01:00:10.336]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.996 --> 01:00:11.797]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.577 --> 01:00:13.457]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:17.818]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.299 --> 01:00:22.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:41.093]  Okay, folks, it is Thursday, the 16th day of May 2012, and the last 30 minutes I had Joseph Curl of DrudgeReport.com and WashingtonTimes.com on with us, and I was saying bye to him at the end of the hour, and he said, hey, you raised Petraeus, that's the big point we need to get to, so he's graciously held over another five minutes with us.
[01:00:41.113 --> 01:00:44.135]  If you just joined us, the whole thing's unraveling, obviously.
[01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:49.579]  They've released from 67 hours later, almost three days later, select emails
[01:00:50.359 --> 01:00:56.284]  Acting like this is the whole data dump, and the media, I have the headlines here, the White House knew nothing about Benghazi.
[01:00:56.304 --> 01:00:57.545]  They were bumbling idiots.
[01:00:58.066 --> 01:00:58.926]  What an old trick.
[01:00:59.427 --> 01:01:08.735]  Almost three days after they've got their talking points straight, but Petraeus is in the email saying, I don't like these talking points, I don't like this story, this basically isn't true.
[01:01:09.475 --> 01:01:23.144]  And Curl on-air was saying, he's got CIA sources, so do I. I have Defense Department sources, like Colonel Schaefer, who swears he'll come on, but it's threatened not to, since he came on to drop bombshells back in October, right after Benghazi.
[01:01:23.564 --> 01:01:27.546]  And so, Curl was saying there's more on Petraeus coming, Petraeus knows.
[01:01:27.846 --> 01:01:28.867]  Is that why they ran him out?
[01:01:28.887 --> 01:01:30.548]  Is that why they fired a bunch of CENTCOM?
[01:01:31.449 --> 01:01:36.412]  Joe Curl, what's the big scoop on Benghazi, the other shoes to drop, and what do you know about Petraeus?
[01:01:37.264 --> 01:01:46.189]  Well, that's the fascinating thing, is that when Petraeus happened, you know, remember, he was head of the CIA, and the CIA was heavily involved in Benghazi.
[01:01:46.229 --> 01:01:59.057]  In fact, you know, some sources have told me that there was the embassy there in Tripoli, there was the annex as well in the consulate in Benghazi, an annex someplace nearby, and people, you know, many people have talked about
[01:01:59.737 --> 01:02:09.302]  Whether there was a dark side in Benghazi, that they were taking some people, suspected terrorists, to a place the CIA may have been heavily involved in, we really don't know.
[01:02:09.322 --> 01:02:19.467]  But it was remarkable that the head of the CIA, a four-star general, Petraeus, was drummed out so quickly over a sex scandal.
[01:02:19.487 --> 01:02:22.089]  Remember, this was after Benghazi happened.
[01:02:22.889 --> 01:02:25.971]  And, you know, there were all kinds of speculation.
[01:02:26.011 --> 01:02:27.932]  No one could prove anything, but there was speculation that
[01:02:29.534 --> 01:02:29.875]  I think so.
[01:02:42.651 --> 01:02:44.813]  The CIA, the State Department, and the White House.
[01:02:45.474 --> 01:02:49.318]  So, Petraeus is the one, I think, who knows an awful lot more about this.
[01:02:49.358 --> 01:03:01.690]  Now, we see in this last email, Petraeus says, you know, after they finally get their talking points together, leave out the terrorist attack, leave out al Qaeda, don't mention anything about a spontaneous protest.
[01:03:03.861 --> 01:03:09.146]  Now we see that Petraeus said, well, I'd rather not use these talking points if you don't mind, because they're not accurate.
[01:03:09.527 --> 01:03:14.992]  The CIA, who actually knows what happened there, was telling the State Department, here's what we're comfortable with.
[01:03:15.053 --> 01:03:20.198]  And the State Department for political reasons, the White House for political reasons, was saying, well, we sure don't want to say that.
[01:03:20.638 --> 01:03:24.422]  The State Department didn't want anything said because they're trying to protect Hillary.
[01:03:25.143 --> 01:03:28.885]  The White House didn't want anything said because they were trying to win re-election.
[01:03:28.925 --> 01:03:31.186]  I mean, this is two months before re-election.
[01:03:31.206 --> 01:03:34.288]  The last thing they can have is a terrorist attack under this president.
[01:03:35.889 --> 01:03:37.130]  It was a protest.
[01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:41.412]  We can now call 9-11 a protest under this new labeling.
[01:03:42.505 --> 01:03:44.126]  Right, exactly.
[01:03:44.226 --> 01:03:47.467]  So, Petraeus is the one I would really watch for.
[01:03:47.547 --> 01:03:52.149]  I think Petraeus, he obviously knows everything that's happened there.
[01:03:52.169 --> 01:03:58.172]  He's obviously not exactly happy with the way he was treated and drummed out.
[01:03:58.272 --> 01:04:04.815]  I mean, you know, it's not unheard of for, you know, certainly the Russians will set up their politicians with scandal.
[01:04:04.855 --> 01:04:06.896]  Sure, why doesn't Congress
[01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:12.398]  Why don't the Republicans call Petraeus for Benghazi hearings?
[01:04:13.538 --> 01:04:15.038]  Well, that would be a brilliant move.
[01:04:15.078 --> 01:04:18.139]  I mean, if they could bring him in.
[01:04:18.159 --> 01:04:21.620]  The question is whether, I mean, can you still call Hillary Clinton?
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.621]  She was Secretary of State then, she isn't now.
[01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:27.802]  Can she be called back in to testify in front of Congress?
[01:04:27.842 --> 01:04:31.524]  Because, obviously, her testimony now is all suspect.
[01:04:31.604 --> 01:04:32.504]  I mean, what she said
[01:04:33.164 --> 01:04:33.364]  Absolutely.
[01:04:33.404 --> 01:04:34.605]  We'll have to get you back up on that soon.
[01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:39.410]  In fact, I see you have a column from a while back saying watch for Petraeus in the Benghazi probe scandal.
[01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.950]  So you called it.
[01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:42.512]  Joe Curl, again, thank you so much for the time.
[01:04:42.552 --> 01:04:42.792]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:42.832 --> 01:04:43.573]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:04:43.593 --> 01:04:44.013]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.385 --> 01:05:03.026]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:05:51.109 --> 01:06:03.812]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:06:04.092 --> 01:06:08.933]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:06:09.113 --> 01:06:16.274]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:06:16.414 --> 01:06:21.838]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:08:12.599 --> 01:08:13.460]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:17.765]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.346 --> 01:08:22.411]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:38.425 --> 01:08:46.952]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two, and the scandals enveloping Obama are exploding.
[01:08:47.813 --> 01:09:03.365]  And now they put out selected emails to confuse everyone that they didn't know anything about Benghazi, but Petraeus and others obviously are out there in the emails exposing that they got their story straight over 67 hours before they put out any emails.
[01:09:03.385 --> 01:09:04.926]  So they're not putting out emails from the first 67 hours.
[01:09:06.387 --> 01:09:09.592]  Pretty outrageous, obvious tactic there.
[01:09:10.072 --> 01:09:16.821]  You've got a hardball, slimeball Chris Matthews saying he doesn't like Obama anymore.
[01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:20.005]  Basically the luster, the tingle in his groin region.
[01:09:21.305 --> 01:09:21.505]  I don't
[01:09:42.236 --> 01:09:49.821]  Are coming out saying that the word is the cloakroom, and that's my word, is that Mitch McConnell and others know the Congress was being spied on.
[01:09:50.081 --> 01:09:51.842]  The cloakroom is where they go to talk shop.
[01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:53.964]  That was tapped.
[01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:55.985]  Of course the Congress is tapped.
[01:09:57.806 --> 01:09:59.407]  I mean, it came out that's going on in England.
[01:09:59.427 --> 01:10:00.268]  The Parliament's tapped.
[01:10:00.608 --> 01:10:02.769]  They are spying on the legitimate government.
[01:10:03.209 --> 01:10:05.351]  As bad as Congress is, that's the elected government.
[01:10:06.084 --> 01:10:11.129]  I mean, they go before Congress and say, the NATO commands our military and commands our president.
[01:10:11.409 --> 01:10:12.951]  I mean, right there, there should have been arrest.
[01:10:13.411 --> 01:10:15.633]  There should have been, you know, helicopters landing.
[01:10:16.294 --> 01:10:18.236]  You know, mass arrest of all these traitors.
[01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:19.877]  You know, huge trials.
[01:10:20.498 --> 01:10:22.740]  I mean, that was just like, I serve NATO.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.321]  Our orders come from NATO.
[01:10:24.341 --> 01:10:28.585]  I mean, America's under foreign power control.
[01:10:31.792 --> 01:10:37.736]  But instead, you know, Congressman Devin Nunes is like, yeah, the word is we're tapped at the Justice Department.
[01:10:38.116 --> 01:10:38.897]  And is that wrong?
[01:10:38.977 --> 01:10:39.517]  I mean, is that?
[01:10:40.258 --> 01:10:41.279]  We played the clip last hour.
[01:10:41.299 --> 01:10:44.961]  It's up on Infowars.com and DrugReport.com as it is from the Weekly Standard.
[01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:46.642]  I mean, is that a wrong thing to do?
[01:10:46.683 --> 01:10:46.823]  I mean...
[01:10:47.628 --> 01:10:49.550]  Does that rise the level of impeachment?
[01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.491]  I don't know.
[01:10:50.571 --> 01:11:00.541]  I mean, you know, it's a felony to do it to anybody without a warrant, but, you know, one branch of government tapping the other branch illegally, you know, tapping the Congress, is that wrong thing to do?
[01:11:01.201 --> 01:11:04.184]  Gee, I don't, you know, is it wrong what Jeffrey Dahmer did?
[01:11:04.325 --> 01:11:07.147]  Is it wrong to rob banks?
[01:11:07.348 --> 01:11:11.452]  I mean, it just never ceases to amaze me, the normalcy bias.
[01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:15.797]  And again, if you don't know what the normalcy bias is, will you pull up the definition of normalcy bias?
[01:11:15.817 --> 01:11:26.807]  Let me give them the technical one, but basically, thanks guys, incredible crew, like octopuses in there running all the stuff, following along with my scattergun way of meandering rabbit trail way of doing things.
[01:11:27.247 --> 01:11:35.655]  It's just that learned helplessness, normalcy bias, it all ties together, but normalcy bias is where you just grow up in tyranny so you think it's normal.
[01:11:36.195 --> 01:11:39.917]  The normalcy bias refers to extreme mental state people enter when facing a disaster.
[01:11:39.937 --> 01:11:45.459]  It causes people to underestimate the severity of the disaster and not to basically respond to it.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.600]  And it's more than that.
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:50.922]  When you just grow up in disasters, you just think it's normal, don't you?
[01:11:50.962 --> 01:11:53.023]  Well, we give our firstborn to Herod.
[01:11:53.043 --> 01:12:02.007]  Or, you know, we give our firstborn to... We give our firstborn to Pharaoh because he wants them killed.
[01:12:03.416 --> 01:12:05.598]  Or the Romans, you know, want to kill the firstborn.
[01:12:05.618 --> 01:12:11.702]  I mean, government was always, in every culture, in Aztecs, you know, I talk about this constantly, they always go, you know, we want your kids.
[01:12:13.203 --> 01:12:14.444]  Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna eat them.
[01:12:16.085 --> 01:12:20.068]  Mesoamerica, that was the main meat source, the ruling class, we're gonna eat your children.
[01:12:20.428 --> 01:12:23.491]  We like the little ones, the veal, the human veal.
[01:12:24.665 --> 01:12:39.549]  And again, if you teleported back to the Aztec Kingdom 600 years ago, and what's Mexico City today, their headquarters, and you said, I think it's wrong that you're gonna kill that one-year-old boy, and chop his heart out, and then have the lower priest class sell the meat in the market.
[01:12:40.009 --> 01:12:48.992]  You know, the sun is actually a gaseous nuclear reaction, and we orbit it, and it's gonna come back up tomorrow, even if you don't chop that heart out.
[01:12:49.792 --> 01:12:50.912]  They would look at you and laugh.
[01:12:53.007 --> 01:12:54.088]  That's the normalcy bias.
[01:12:54.448 --> 01:13:07.620]  We played the clip and Devin Nunes, who you've got to say has courage compared to most of them, is like, well the other big shoe to drop is we've been told the cloakroom is wiretapped and they've bugged us and they're listening to us.
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:09.041]  Is that bad?
[01:13:09.101 --> 01:13:09.902]  Is that wrong?
[01:13:10.502 --> 01:13:13.405]  And I guess that's a tactic to kind of go, what do you think about that?
[01:13:13.425 --> 01:13:14.346]  Is that a problem?
[01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:21.006]  So maybe he was just being cheeky, but we played earlier Sgt.
[01:13:21.607 --> 01:13:26.111]  Schultz from Hogan's Heroes going, I know nothing, I know nothing, I know nothing.
[01:13:26.512 --> 01:13:28.994]  But here is the new Sgt.
[01:13:29.094 --> 01:13:35.240]  Schultz, Attorney General of Fast and Furious, Deputy Attorney General who covered up Oklahoma City, that came out in federal court.
[01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:37.903]  He's a very nice man.
[01:13:38.924 --> 01:13:39.624]  Eric Holder.
[01:13:40.325 --> 01:13:47.391]  And see, in the beginning, a patriot's a scarce man, hated, feared, scorned, but in time, when his cause succeeds, put him adjoining, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:13:48.612 --> 01:13:49.313]  That's Mark Twain.
[01:13:50.093 --> 01:14:10.670]  I had to hit the bar bar early on and talk about Agenda 21 and cancer viruses and vaccines and the government hiring and running Al Qaeda and then finally, God love them, Glenn Beck started covering it, Michael Savage has been covering it for years, talking about false flags that Obama could stage, and then now Limbaugh's covering it and Sean Hannity's covering it and now
[01:14:13.257 --> 01:14:18.002]  More and more people are covering it because of Infowars.com and I gotta give credit where credit's due.
[01:14:18.363 --> 01:14:22.587]  The first mega alternative media, I mean, what do you call it?
[01:14:24.304 --> 01:14:27.886]  It's not mainline media, it's not alternative media, it's just free media.
[01:14:28.266 --> 01:14:29.287]  DrudgeReport.com.
[01:14:29.327 --> 01:14:33.709]  So, InfoWars, then Drudge, and then now everybody else follows.
[01:14:33.729 --> 01:14:34.210]  And that's good!
[01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:44.896]  But let me tell you, it's a lonely feeling to be demonized and attacked and know you're right and be out front on things that are admitted and hiding in plain view, like NSA wiretapping of everybody.
[01:14:45.763 --> 01:14:48.085]  Oh yeah, everything's recorded, Alex.
[01:14:48.305 --> 01:14:49.626]  Yeah, it's in the Telecommunications Act.
[01:14:49.646 --> 01:14:49.966]  Here it is.
[01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:53.809]  The spec's putting it in place in 1996 over a five-year period.
[01:14:53.829 --> 01:14:54.349]  Here, just read it.
[01:14:54.529 --> 01:14:55.510]  I'm not gonna read that kook.
[01:14:56.391 --> 01:15:00.794]  Now they're on CNN going, yeah, we record everything you do going back at least ten years.
[01:15:00.814 --> 01:15:03.035]  At least, well, actually 13, 19, 2001.
[01:15:03.556 --> 01:15:08.519]  So we can just go back and hear all your conversations.
[01:15:08.619 --> 01:15:10.441]  It's for your safety, of course.
[01:15:10.861 --> 01:15:11.502]  See, now
[01:15:12.711 --> 01:15:13.691]  I thought Bilderberg didn't.
[01:15:14.171 --> 01:15:21.033]  Just four years ago, New York Times said Bilderberg does not exist, and that I'm a full-on schizophrenic, imagining Bilderberg in Virginia.
[01:15:22.493 --> 01:15:24.274]  Really, now it's all over the British press again.
[01:15:24.294 --> 01:15:26.294]  Now it's all admitted.
[01:15:26.334 --> 01:15:29.675]  Now people brag they go, since we blew its cover, and go, it's no big deal.
[01:15:29.975 --> 01:15:33.336]  Now it is secret, and we'll try to arrest any reporters that try to get near.
[01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:36.536]  But, uh, it's no big deal, Mr. Gopher.
[01:15:36.556 --> 01:15:39.757]  You know, Caddyshack, it's no big deal.
[01:15:40.933 --> 01:15:46.776]  Maybe we can find that clip where Bill Murray's dropping the plastic explosive in.
[01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:48.977]  Just a friendly squirrel, Mr. Gopher.
[01:15:48.997 --> 01:15:51.118]  Not a plastic explosive or anything.
[01:15:51.619 --> 01:15:56.061]  You know, I mean, they're changing laws to take your bank accounts and announcing it.
[01:15:56.361 --> 01:15:59.042]  What's wrong with having your bank account taken by a foreign bank?
[01:15:59.603 --> 01:16:01.043]  What's wrong with Bank of America?
[01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:05.386]  It's really a foreign bank, you know, taking people's houses they don't even have deeds to that are paid for.
[01:16:05.406 --> 01:16:07.547]  I mean, it's no big deal, Mr. Gopher.
[01:16:09.793 --> 01:16:10.454]  I mean, come on!
[01:16:10.974 --> 01:16:18.540]  But speaking of comedy, because it's unintentional comedy, here is the Attorney General yesterday saying, I don't know, I don't know.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.081]  There's only some of the I don't knows.
[01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:20.921]  I know nothings.
[01:16:20.941 --> 01:16:21.362]  Here it is.
[01:16:21.382 --> 01:16:22.963]  Do you know why that was not done?
[01:16:24.011 --> 01:16:25.932]  There are exceptions to that rule.
[01:16:26.272 --> 01:16:27.393]  I do not know, however.
[01:16:27.413 --> 01:16:29.614]  Again, Mr. Chairman, I don't know.
[01:16:30.315 --> 01:16:31.015]  I don't know.
[01:16:31.715 --> 01:16:32.736]  I don't know.
[01:16:32.756 --> 01:16:33.657]  I don't know.
[01:16:33.917 --> 01:16:34.337]  I don't know.
[01:16:34.617 --> 01:16:35.057]  I don't know.
[01:16:35.678 --> 01:16:36.558]  I don't know.
[01:16:37.239 --> 01:16:37.919]  That I don't know.
[01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:38.760]  I just don't know.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.461]  I don't know whether or not... I just don't know.
[01:16:41.521 --> 01:16:43.862]  I don't know exactly how IRS has constructed it.
[01:16:45.103 --> 01:16:46.384]  I don't know when the subpoena was issued.
[01:16:47.031 --> 01:16:48.212]  Well, I don't know precisely.
[01:16:48.832 --> 01:16:49.412]  I don't know.
[01:16:49.792 --> 01:16:50.292]  I don't know.
[01:16:50.312 --> 01:16:52.993]  I don't know the specific questions.
[01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:54.314]  Again, I don't know what happened.
[01:16:54.374 --> 01:16:55.775]  Well, either you know or you don't know.
[01:16:55.795 --> 01:16:56.275]  I don't know.
[01:16:56.355 --> 01:16:56.755]  I don't know.
[01:16:56.775 --> 01:16:58.116]  I don't know.
[01:16:59.196 --> 01:16:59.836]  I don't know.
[01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:00.997]  I just don't know when.
[01:17:01.057 --> 01:17:01.417]  I don't know.
[01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:05.178]  I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
[01:17:05.679 --> 01:17:05.939]  Alright.
[01:17:06.459 --> 01:17:07.119]  I did not know.
[01:17:07.199 --> 01:17:09.060]  I don't know what you are going to ask me.
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:09.820]  I didn't know.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.842]  I technically... I don't know.
[01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:13.522]  I don't know.
[01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:16.464]  I know nothing!
[01:17:16.584 --> 01:17:17.585]  I have seen nothing!
[01:17:18.025 --> 01:17:19.026]  I was not even here!
[01:17:19.046 --> 01:17:23.249]  I mean, this is so in your face, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:26.472]  Now I want to go to a clip of Mike Judge, some more humor here.
[01:17:26.952 --> 01:17:33.097]  Again, the fact that Mike Judge, who is obviously a libertarian type guy from King of the Hill and the messages that are in that,
[01:17:35.238 --> 01:17:36.279]  I'd always suspected this.
[01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:40.240]  I've talked to him over the years here and there over the phone and text messages, and we have a lot of mutual friends.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:45.682]  But I interviewed Mike Judge a few days ago, about a 50-minute interview raw.
[01:17:47.343 --> 01:17:50.604]  There's phones ringing and stuff in the background, so it'll be about 45 minutes long.
[01:17:50.864 --> 01:17:55.005]  We're going to premiere it next Thursday in one of the three hours.
[01:17:55.065 --> 01:17:57.006]  If there's big breaking news, it'll be in the third hour.
[01:17:57.246 --> 01:17:59.267]  If there's not a bunch of breaking news, it'll be in the second hour.
[01:18:00.087 --> 01:18:02.769]  But we're going to premiere that here on the radio slash TV.
[01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:07.694]  It's radio for all the listeners on XM and over 150 affiliates out there.
[01:18:08.414 --> 01:18:12.157]  But you can also go to prisonplanet.tv if you're a member and see the video.
[01:18:12.418 --> 01:18:15.920]  But the little trailer that I'm about to play of your radio listener...
[01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:20.941]  You can see the video of it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:18:20.981 --> 01:18:21.902]  It just went up there.
[01:18:22.322 --> 01:18:24.904]  Comedy icon Mike Judge talks to Alex Jones.
[01:18:25.845 --> 01:18:28.286]  And so this little teaser is up there if you actually want to see the video.
[01:18:29.007 --> 01:18:35.552]  But, you know, the fact that Mike Judge, who I looked into it, does not ever really talk about his views politically openly, he did with us.
[01:18:35.612 --> 01:18:36.592]  And I actually held back.
[01:18:36.652 --> 01:18:45.139]  He was saying so much I didn't want to, because they will, they try to keep people that are big Hollywood A-list on a short leash, but he's a great, great patriot.
[01:18:46.219 --> 01:18:48.960]  Montana slash Texan, a nice mix there.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:57.243]  But let's go to Mike Judge who, well, is a rocket scientist and one of, literally, and one of the greatest comedic minds ever.
[01:18:57.723 --> 01:19:00.223]  And he agreed with my analysis that he's a satirist.
[01:19:00.624 --> 01:19:08.026]  So let's go to a little teaser of the Mike Judge interview coming up next Thursday, seven days from now, on this transmission.
[01:19:08.066 --> 01:19:08.346]  Here it is.
[01:19:13.476 --> 01:19:19.079]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:19:19.579 --> 01:19:24.482]  My judge, what is the secret of the universe?
[01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:39.794]  There were people literally on the YouTube going, I can do a better Beavis and Budhead.
[01:19:39.834 --> 01:19:40.895]  I can do a better Hank Hill.
[01:19:41.155 --> 01:19:42.676]  That's how dumb some YouTubers are.
[01:19:42.696 --> 01:19:44.677]  People are like, hey, that's the originator.
[01:19:44.937 --> 01:19:47.639]  There's no way you can do it better than him.
[01:19:47.659 --> 01:19:50.541]  I mean, I can do a Bill Clinton, but I'm not Bill Clinton.
[01:19:50.621 --> 01:19:50.901]  Got it?
[01:19:51.381 --> 01:19:53.803]  Let's go out with the new White House press secretary.
[01:19:53.843 --> 01:19:54.203]  Here it is.
[01:19:54.463 --> 01:19:55.744]  Oh, I see nothing.
[01:19:56.044 --> 01:19:57.145]  I was not here.
[01:19:57.385 --> 01:19:59.946]  I did not even get up this morning.
[01:20:01.744 --> 01:20:04.666]  If you're going to have a bunker, why not have an Ultimate Bunker?
[01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:12.091]  In case of pandemic outbreak, civil unrest, biological or nuclear fallout, or EMP attacks, stay safe in your own Ultimate Bunker.
[01:20:12.371 --> 01:20:14.993]  Built for lasting security for any need or budget.
[01:20:15.233 --> 01:20:20.516]  Manufactured in Salt Lake City, Utah, each Ultimate Bunker includes free food storage and all the comforts of home.

[01:20:31.548 --> 01:20:32.588]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:32.768 --> 01:20:37.070]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:42.871]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:46.312]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:46.553 --> 01:20:49.133]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:49.233 --> 01:20:54.055]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:21:01.337 --> 01:21:02.578]  Don't throw away leftovers.

[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:16.904]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[01:21:17.184 --> 01:21:22.646]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.

[01:21:25.367 --> 01:21:35.132]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[01:21:58.236 --> 01:21:58.838]  Terragonics.

[01:22:01.021 --> 01:22:04.044]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:22:04.404 --> 01:22:09.829]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:13.613]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:22:14.293 --> 01:22:15.554]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[01:22:15.875 --> 01:22:19.718]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[01:22:36.695 --> 01:22:38.276]  Get SimpliSafe.com.

[01:22:57.399 --> 01:22:59.562]  Again, that's GetSimpliSafe.com.
[01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:06.733]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:08.434]  That's closer than you think.
[01:23:09.174 --> 01:23:14.996]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[01:23:16.877 --> 01:23:23.279]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:29.622]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[01:23:30.362 --> 01:23:31.383]  But here's some good news.
[01:23:31.743 --> 01:23:40.590]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[01:23:41.231 --> 01:23:50.038]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[01:23:50.498 --> 01:23:54.541]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[01:23:54.702 --> 01:23:56.203]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[01:24:14.185 --> 01:24:15.746]  Uh, hello, Mr. Gopher.
[01:24:16.346 --> 01:24:18.748]  Yeah, it's me, Mr. Squirrel.
[01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:20.829]  Yeah, hi.
[01:24:21.449 --> 01:24:25.692]  Uh, just a harmless squirrel, not a plastic explosive or anything, nothing to be worried about.
[01:24:26.032 --> 01:24:29.594]  I'm just here to make your last hours on Earth as peaceful as possible.
[01:24:30.234 --> 01:24:32.516]  Yes, don't mind this, this is a doctor's order and so forth.
[01:24:32.536 --> 01:24:35.557]  Yeah, you don't mind if I just pop in there, a few laughs, huh?
[01:24:36.018 --> 01:24:36.798]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:41.281]  Well, in the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, au revoir, good fare.
[01:24:58.857 --> 01:25:04.301]  Ladies and gentlemen, if the gopher is scared of the plastic explosive,
[01:25:05.287 --> 01:25:07.087]  He is a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:07.588 --> 01:25:11.588]  They're setting up cameras behind armored vehicles, millions of bullets.
[01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:18.290]  The training manuals say they're preparing to put us in, quote, re-education camps, official army manuals.
[01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:25.451]  I can put it on screen for you if you like, or just type in, a new army manual covers re-education camps, how to break our families up.
[01:25:25.812 --> 01:25:27.712]  It says who they're going to put in there, Tea Party people!
[01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:33.394]  And the IRS is targeting us and, you know, they're running torture camps all over the world.
[01:25:33.955 --> 01:25:35.336]  Everything's fine, Mr. Gopher.
[01:25:35.716 --> 01:25:37.417]  Not a plastic explosive or anything.
[01:25:37.838 --> 01:25:42.101]  Nothing to worry about, Mr. Squirrel, in your last hours on Earth.
[01:25:42.641 --> 01:25:44.763]  I mean, the tyranny is here.
[01:25:46.124 --> 01:25:48.145]  And I say the Gopher is a conspiracy theorist.
[01:25:48.366 --> 01:25:56.252]  He should have gone and hugged the plastic explosive, even though he looked through the window and saw the greenskeeper, with the explosives, talking about his plan to blow up the Gopher.
[01:25:57.148 --> 01:25:59.249]  Even though the globalists have got all these public documents.
[01:25:59.509 --> 01:26:01.049]  It's on record they ship in the drugs.
[01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:02.650]  It's on record they launder the money.
[01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:03.310]  It's on record!
[01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:07.992]  They had congressional hearings in 97 with the inspector general of the CIA admitting it.
[01:26:08.572 --> 01:26:11.433]  But we're just supposed to go, oh, nothing to worry about, Mr. Gover.
[01:26:12.214 --> 01:26:16.275]  Now joining us for the balance of the hour is Kevin Booth.
[01:26:16.335 --> 01:26:19.096]  And folks, he's really here because he was a producer for Bill Hicks.
[01:26:19.616 --> 01:26:22.137]  We're just going to go come clean since everybody on the internet has exposed us.
[01:26:22.557 --> 01:26:23.818]  We're running scared right now.
[01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:27.367]  Folks, I am Bill Hicks.
[01:26:28.508 --> 01:26:30.729]  I joked the other day and said that, and people said he accidentally said it.
[01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:32.471]  I accidentally just said it again right there.
[01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:35.592]  And it's actually kind of mean to the family, folks.
[01:26:35.632 --> 01:26:37.834]  Bill really did die of pancreatic cancer.
[01:26:37.854 --> 01:26:42.497]  And that's not why Kevin Booth is here.
[01:26:42.517 --> 01:26:43.837]  He's here to talk about American Drug War II.
[01:26:44.758 --> 01:26:46.019]  I just want to be honest with folks.
[01:26:46.079 --> 01:26:49.261]  Actually, Kevin Booth is Bill Hicks and Sam Kennison.
[01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:50.782]  He was good friends with him as well.
[01:26:51.763 --> 01:26:54.084]  And folks, Richard Pryor didn't die.
[01:26:54.785 --> 01:26:55.405]  I'm going to be honest.
[01:26:55.425 --> 01:26:56.105]  I'm not Bill Hicks.
[01:26:56.446 --> 01:26:57.246]  I'm Richard Pryor.
[01:26:58.007 --> 01:26:58.327]  OK?
[01:26:58.467 --> 01:26:59.808]  I'm like Michael Jackson.
[01:26:59.848 --> 01:27:01.529]  They took the pigment out of my skin.
[01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:04.051]  And I'm Richard Pryor, folks.
[01:27:04.991 --> 01:27:05.371]  I'm also...
[01:27:06.383 --> 01:27:06.603]  St.
[01:27:06.623 --> 01:27:10.065]  Jerome, George Carlin, and a Vatican assassin.
[01:27:10.506 --> 01:27:15.909]  So, you're going to talk about American Drug War II, which actually wasn't produced by you, it was produced by Bill Hicks.
[01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:21.153]  Kevin, do you want to come clean with the fact of how you were the mastermind producer behind my transformation?
[01:27:22.652 --> 01:27:28.176]  Uh, well, even though both you guys are still alive at the same time, uh... I'm 2Pops Shakur, too.
[01:27:28.737 --> 01:27:33.860]  We started the plastic surgery in the, uh, out at the Port-A-Potty at the, uh, public access station.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.783]  We had a team of plastic surgeons... Sorry, guys.
[01:27:37.803 --> 01:27:41.386]  ...behind the Port-A-Potty in the dumpster back there, making the transformations.
[01:27:43.167 --> 01:27:45.228]  But I'm sure you have sacredcowproductions.com.
[01:27:45.248 --> 01:27:47.690]  I'm sure you're... I mean, this has been going on for years now, man.
[01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:51.253]  They're digging through my, like, birth records and stuff to prove I'm Bill Hicks.
[01:27:52.763 --> 01:27:54.003]  Yeah, no, I was amazed.
[01:27:54.023 --> 01:27:58.044]  I went on YouTube the other day and searched it and there's hundreds of videos now.
[01:27:58.104 --> 01:27:59.925]  So it's definitely, it's taking off.
[01:28:01.125 --> 01:28:01.885]  It's taken off.
[01:28:02.325 --> 01:28:03.586]  But it's mean to the family.
[01:28:03.906 --> 01:28:04.806]  It's mean to the family.
[01:28:04.826 --> 01:28:06.746]  Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[01:28:06.886 --> 01:28:11.808]  And then, you know, when you got Russell Crowe calling you up asking if you're really Bill Hicks, you know it's gone too far.
[01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:15.449]  I just, I can't handle it, man.
[01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:17.069]  I'm living in a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:28:18.991 --> 01:28:21.393]  I'm sorry, you want to address me as Bill now, Kevin?
[01:28:21.413 --> 01:28:22.414]  Alright, Billy.
[01:28:23.055 --> 01:28:26.638]  But doesn't it kind of make you mad being good friends with Bill and being there when he died to hear all this?
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:33.545]  You know, what makes me mad are just some of the people out there that aren't real crazy about you.
[01:28:33.645 --> 01:28:40.712]  Like some of the Bill fans that are not so crazy about you that are saying, you know, Kevin owes us some sort
[01:28:42.179 --> 01:28:44.181]  Well, they cut the feed right there.
[01:28:44.201 --> 01:28:45.622]  They didn't want us to hear the Bill Hicks thing.
[01:28:45.642 --> 01:28:47.243]  That was us cutting the feed.
[01:28:47.784 --> 01:28:48.805]  Kevin, your audio cut out.
[01:28:49.365 --> 01:28:49.826]  Say that again.
[01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:50.866]  Bill Hicks fans say what?
[01:28:51.687 --> 01:28:52.468]  My fans say what?
[01:28:53.449 --> 01:28:58.553]  You know, I just get a lot from like the Bill Hicks fans that aren't all that crazy about you.
[01:28:59.674 --> 01:29:04.498]  Always saying, well, Kevin Booth owes us some sort of an explanation for his association with Alex.
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:06.640]  But I'm Bill.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.562]  I mean, well, how would you not keep associating with me?
[01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:12.573]  I know, they've got the eye scanning to prove it.
[01:29:12.653 --> 01:29:13.354]  They can prove it.
[01:29:13.714 --> 01:29:14.435]  They've got everything.
[01:29:14.475 --> 01:29:17.537]  The one guy goes into detail.
[01:29:17.578 --> 01:29:19.479]  He puts your eyes over each other.
[01:29:19.599 --> 01:29:25.625]  Anybody out there, just go to YouTube and just do Bill Hicks is Alex Jones and you'll see all these videos.
[01:29:25.725 --> 01:29:26.906]  Well, you know, we're getting desperate.
[01:29:26.926 --> 01:29:29.529]  We're getting desperate while we're talking about this.
[01:29:29.549 --> 01:29:31.110]  This is damage control, Kevin.
[01:29:31.551 --> 01:29:31.711]  Yeah.
[01:29:33.112 --> 01:29:33.773]  All right, folks.
[01:29:34.093 --> 01:29:34.854]  No, for the family.
[01:29:34.894 --> 01:29:36.475]  I'm not gonna joke around about this.
[01:29:36.535 --> 01:29:37.316]  I am not Bill Hicks.
[01:29:38.016 --> 01:29:38.316]  Okay?
[01:29:38.937 --> 01:29:40.638]  I'm actually Bill Clinton's son.
[01:29:41.759 --> 01:29:44.301]  All right, we're gonna be, uh... No, it's true, folks.
[01:29:44.401 --> 01:29:47.243]  I have to... Okay, we're gonna get serious, get into the drug war.
[01:29:47.764 --> 01:29:50.426]  Straight ahead with Kevin Booth, American Drug War II.
[01:29:50.786 --> 01:29:51.667]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.167 --> 01:29:53.769]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:57.372]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.775 --> 01:30:04.838]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[01:30:05.178 --> 01:30:10.642]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:30:11.223 --> 01:30:14.426]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:31:01.488 --> 01:31:03.389]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:31:03.429 --> 01:31:05.369]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:31:05.589 --> 01:31:11.091]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:31:11.311 --> 01:31:15.092]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:31:15.352 --> 01:31:19.113]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:31:19.274 --> 01:31:20.474]  The fact is, you are.
[01:31:20.674 --> 01:31:21.454]  We all are.
[01:31:21.674 --> 01:31:24.015]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[01:31:51.682 --> 01:32:02.867]  I had tried everything.
[01:32:02.927 --> 01:32:05.088]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:32:05.288 --> 01:32:07.989]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:32:08.409 --> 01:32:12.911]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:32:13.251 --> 01:32:19.614]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:32:20.114 --> 01:32:30.596]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:32:31.316 --> 01:32:35.437]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:32:35.797 --> 01:32:41.819]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:32:42.059 --> 01:32:43.199]  Now that's results.
[01:32:43.619 --> 01:32:50.043]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[01:32:50.403 --> 01:32:55.726]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:32:58.667 --> 01:32:59.748]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:32:59.788 --> 01:33:00.388]  We've got it.
[01:33:01.789 --> 01:33:06.031]  The Christmas is coming to you.
[01:33:08.948 --> 01:33:13.072]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:13.333 --> 01:33:21.842]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:22.162 --> 01:33:24.504]  Kevin Booth grew up in Houston, Texas.
[01:33:24.905 --> 01:33:26.386]  He was a teenager.
[01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:28.188]  Him and Bill Hicks were best friends.
[01:33:28.208 --> 01:33:29.370]  That's why we're getting into Bill Hicks.
[01:33:30.823 --> 01:33:34.505]  And I want to get into your new film and hold you a little bit in the next hour as I got you on late.
[01:33:34.565 --> 01:33:38.787]  Larry Pinckney, one of the founders of the Black Panther Party, is going to be in studio with us.
[01:33:39.228 --> 01:33:40.748]  He's also going to be on the Nightly News tonight.
[01:33:41.729 --> 01:33:43.370]  And we're here interviewing him for a film I'm making.
[01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:53.435]  But congratulations on American Drug War being, I've seen it in a lot of newspapers, cited as something that's really exposed the drug wars, the fraud it is, aired on a lot of the big cable networks, big hit.
[01:33:53.816 --> 01:33:59.639]  American Drug War 2, I've talked to people that have seen it, say it is an unrivaled masterpiece and blows the first one away.
[01:34:00.379 --> 01:34:04.680]  I mean, you probably are six, seven years, correct me if I'm wrong, in the making of this.
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:08.161]  I know how that is when you really want to make a real film, you just get obsessed with it.
[01:34:08.621 --> 01:34:09.441]  He moved out to L.A.
[01:34:09.461 --> 01:34:13.662]  to really cover the drug war more closely, to make American Drug War II.
[01:34:13.682 --> 01:34:15.702]  I think you told me it's been picked up by Warner Brothers.
[01:34:16.022 --> 01:34:18.022]  It's going to be in select theaters across the country.
[01:34:18.623 --> 01:34:21.583]  Very important to be a hit in theaters so it gets expanded everywhere.
[01:34:22.503 --> 01:34:24.144]  But this gets into what it does to children.
[01:34:24.264 --> 01:34:25.124]  American Drug War II.
[01:34:26.324 --> 01:34:35.230]  And so we will be breaking that down and playing some exclusive video audio clips never before seen here today ahead of its release.
[01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:35.851]  We're going to get into that.
[01:34:35.871 --> 01:34:45.157]  But since we bring up Bill Hicks, talk about growing up a little bit briefly with Bill Hicks, being his first producer with stuff like Ninja Bachelor Party and so much more.
[01:34:45.577 --> 01:34:47.178]  And then, of course, you told me the story privately.
[01:34:47.198 --> 01:34:49.500]  I think it's also in the best-selling book that came out later.
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.622]  About, you know, being there the day he died of pancreatic cancer.
[01:34:53.043 --> 01:34:56.265]  You know, I'm not afraid to die, but I've got so much work I want to do.
[01:34:56.626 --> 01:34:57.967]  And Bill had so much work.
[01:34:58.007 --> 01:34:58.788]  He was so young.
[01:34:58.808 --> 01:35:02.211]  I mean, just a few minutes on Bill Hicks, remembering him.
[01:35:02.856 --> 01:35:03.096]  Okay.
[01:35:03.256 --> 01:35:05.477]  God, I never know what to expect when I come on here.
[01:35:05.497 --> 01:35:07.438]  You're all serious, then you get all funny on me.
[01:35:07.918 --> 01:35:09.278]  It's like a roller coaster ride.
[01:35:10.799 --> 01:35:18.381]  You know, I mean, that's an interesting thing because, I mean, you're going 100 miles an hour and basically Bill was never a guy that wasted any time.
[01:35:18.401 --> 01:35:25.583]  And when he would be around people that wasted his time or just wanted to hang out, he would usually, like, bolt and go do his own thing.
[01:35:25.623 --> 01:35:26.764]  He was trying to achieve things.
[01:35:27.384 --> 01:35:49.810]  But definitely once Bill was diagnosed with cancer, instead of running around and telling everybody, he didn't want people to feel sorry for him, and he didn't want people to coddle him, and he definitely didn't want his life to slow down, so he kept it a complete secret, even from me for a long time, and basically just cranked up the volume, and he got as much done as possible before he passed away.
[01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:51.250]  And the whole time when he was sick,
[01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:53.512]  You know, it was believed he was going to pull through.
[01:35:53.572 --> 01:35:58.056]  I mean, you know, we're all praying for this miracle and for a while the tumor markers were looking better.
[01:35:58.636 --> 01:36:04.482]  But we literally, he got sick while we were working on an album called Arizona Bay in my home studio.
[01:36:04.502 --> 01:36:06.824]  It was an album where we were doing music and comedy together.
[01:36:07.644 --> 01:36:10.567]  And we did Rant in E Minor while he was sick.
[01:36:11.148 --> 01:36:13.229]  We worked on a brand new Ninja Bachelor party.
[01:36:13.269 --> 01:36:15.952]  We did a bunch of TV shows and interviews and he was
[01:36:16.492 --> 01:36:21.277]  We're working on a pilot for a TV show for Channel 4 in England called Council of the Netherworld.
[01:36:22.057 --> 01:36:35.450]  And so Bill, even though he was extremely sick, probably in a lot of pain, he was just running to the finish line and knowing that this was going to be the legacy that he left behind on Earth, whatever that was.
[01:36:36.661 --> 01:36:37.282]  Incredible.
[01:36:37.542 --> 01:36:38.644]  Amazing comedian.
[01:36:38.704 --> 01:36:40.125]  Amazing political mind.
[01:36:40.205 --> 01:36:41.387]  It's just a ride.
[01:36:41.988 --> 01:36:44.010]  Alright, Kevin, shifting gears into your film.
[01:36:44.751 --> 01:36:45.512]  I'm going from memory.
[01:36:45.532 --> 01:36:46.032]  Am I right?
[01:36:46.153 --> 01:36:48.535]  Seven years you've spent on American Drug War II?
[01:36:49.488 --> 01:36:52.510]  Well, I mean, you know, I've been on this topic now for about ten years.
[01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:54.852]  I mean, just kind of like you with Police State.
[01:36:54.912 --> 01:36:58.335]  You know, you keep making the same movie over and over again until you get it right.
[01:36:58.375 --> 01:37:14.067]  You know, we did American Drug War One, which covered all the aspects of the drug war, from the Ricky Ross, CIA crack cocaine, to the crystal meth epidemic, to private prisons and how they operate, up into touching on medical marijuana.
[01:37:14.367 --> 01:37:17.890]  Then we put out another film called How We Won the West, which is a little bit more of a playful
[01:37:18.650 --> 01:37:46.883]  Film showing like the business of marijuana in California and what the future of business could be and really back there in 2009 everybody was thinking like this is it it's gonna be legalized well things have really gone downhill since then we've got another initiative here in California Prop D that we're supposedly supposed to be voting on and so we've gone from having a thousand dispensaries in LA down to like a hundred and thirty legally operated ones and so you know I just got back from Denver now if you want to be a pothead go to Denver
[01:37:47.163 --> 01:37:49.244]  Like, they don't even smoke marijuana anymore.
[01:37:49.425 --> 01:37:51.346]  Everybody smokes this thing called dabs now.
[01:37:51.406 --> 01:37:56.689]  It's funny, they finally legalized marijuana, and now marijuana's not good enough for them anymore.
[01:37:56.749 --> 01:38:01.252]  It's all about this dabbing thing, which is like this really hardcore, powerful stuff.
[01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:06.735]  I'm sure I'm going to get some people complaining that I said that, but it just seems like, you know, how high can you get?
[01:38:06.755 --> 01:38:09.537]  But Denver's gone to pot, in a good way.
[01:38:09.577 --> 01:38:10.517]  It was fun, it's fun.
[01:38:10.557 --> 01:38:14.460]  But if you want to, like, just go crazy and smoke pot, move to Denver for sure.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.102]  But marijuana didn't used to be as strong as it is now.
[01:38:18.122 --> 01:38:20.144]  It's like horse tranquilizers now or something.
[01:38:20.544 --> 01:38:25.028]  Well, you know, but the point of that is, though, is that really the stronger it gets, the less you need to smoke.
[01:38:25.088 --> 01:38:31.453]  And so if the complaint is that smoking things is bad for you, which it is, smoking anything is not good for you, then the less you smoke, the better.
[01:38:31.473 --> 01:38:35.796]  So, you know, people argue, well, this isn't your this isn't your
[01:38:35.976 --> 01:38:39.538]  Parents would stock marijuana anymore, and that's why it should be against the law.
[01:38:40.058 --> 01:38:47.923]  Well, but the point is, back in the day, somebody would have to smoke ten joints to rival the high you get from one bong hit of some of the special stuff.
[01:38:47.943 --> 01:38:49.904]  Especially if you're vaping with Willie Nelson.
[01:38:50.504 --> 01:38:51.725]  Yeah, or dabbing.
[01:38:52.165 --> 01:38:52.886]  Look up dabbing.
[01:38:53.346 --> 01:38:55.487]  Dabbing is like the next level.
[01:38:55.547 --> 01:38:57.328]  Of course, nobody could be happy.
[01:38:57.348 --> 01:38:58.849]  I was in a club in Denver.
[01:38:58.889 --> 01:38:59.950]  I just wanted to take a hit.
[01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:01.231]  You know, I could travel with it.
[01:39:02.111 --> 01:39:04.252]  Everybody's like, oh, you still smoke flour?
[01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:06.652]  Hey, this old guy, look at this old guy, still smokes flour.
[01:39:06.672 --> 01:39:07.673]  Oh my God.
[01:39:08.773 --> 01:39:09.633]  What an old timer.
[01:39:09.653 --> 01:39:10.913]  He doesn't dab.
[01:39:10.933 --> 01:39:16.015]  I'm sorry, but let's get into the film because it shows what this does to kids.
[01:39:16.375 --> 01:39:20.996]  Right, so off the bat, I mean, you know, to start, I wanted to not start directly on marijuana.
[01:39:21.136 --> 01:39:26.638]  And you know, my wife and I, Trey, tried to have children for many years and haven't been able to have children.
[01:39:28.058 --> 01:39:30.540]  And so we decided to become foster parents here in Los Angeles.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:37.727]  And when we didn't do this as part of the film, it just was one of these things that became, and I've been accused of doing this for the film, but we actually ended up coaching the children.
[01:39:37.747 --> 01:39:38.607]  You can't respond to trolls, Kevin.
[01:39:38.648 --> 01:39:41.190]  I mean, you like adopt a bunch of sheltered dogs.
[01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:42.911]  The truth is, is that those were the babies.
[01:39:43.872 --> 01:39:48.837]  Everybody's maternal, and so now you want to take care of real humans, and it's good you also take care of all the dogs.
[01:39:49.517 --> 01:39:59.783]  So, you know, here in Los Angeles County alone there's 35,000 children that have been taken away from their parents in these horrible group homes and foster homes and it's a business.
[01:40:00.063 --> 01:40:04.965]  The business becomes how many children can you stick in one home to make as much money.
[01:40:05.446 --> 01:40:09.508]  This is really a CPS film, that's why it's so powerful, that's why I'm surprised they've picked it up.
[01:40:09.668 --> 01:40:12.850]  Get into that, what you discovered being involved in this.
[01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:24.718]  Well, you know, right off the bat, right before Christmas, not this last Christmas, but the Christmas before, we had a younger, 11-year-old girl named Stephanie brought to our home, and she was going to spend Christmas with us.
[01:40:25.378 --> 01:40:31.363]  Seemed like a totally normal, rational child, and then comes, like, all these bottles of pills.
[01:40:31.963 --> 01:40:35.625]  And they say, OK, you got to give her these in the morning and these at night.
[01:40:36.225 --> 01:40:37.305]  And it's, you know, Adderall.
[01:40:37.365 --> 01:40:44.388]  And we come to realize that she has to be basically given amphetamines in the morning and then barbiturates at night.
[01:40:44.668 --> 01:40:53.012]  And she just came from a group home where all the kids in this one group home were on the same exact regimen of barbiturates and amphetamines.
[01:40:53.372 --> 01:40:54.753]  And it's basically just a way
[01:40:55.653 --> 01:40:57.934]  Of chemically controlling a group.
[01:40:57.954 --> 01:40:59.155]  It's like a chemical straitjacket.
[01:40:59.175 --> 01:41:02.216]  By the way, about 20% of our military is now, they're doing that to them too.
[01:41:02.236 --> 01:41:04.057]  I mean, this is, this is THX 1138.
[01:41:04.277 --> 01:41:06.619]  Yeah, no, it's, it's unbelievable.
[01:41:06.659 --> 01:41:17.824]  And so we, we, you know, and, and the thing was, we were put into a position of if we didn't give her the medication, they would remove her from us because they're, you know, screening her and testing her constantly while she was with us.
[01:41:18.024 --> 01:41:20.726]  And you discovered they do this to all of them basically because they get more money
[01:41:21.286 --> 01:41:36.297]  Yeah, well basically what you find out in the foster system very quickly is that the higher, like the more problems your kid has, the more money you can make and the more money all the social workers make and everybody involved.
[01:41:36.597 --> 01:41:50.767]  So you're a successful writer, filmmaker, I'm not going to brag, but you live in a famous guy's former house, you're in a nice place, you don't need this for the money, you know, three wolves and five dogs isn't enough, you're paternal, you want to take care of some young people.
[01:41:51.684 --> 01:41:52.745]  We're just trying to help a kid.
[01:41:52.945 --> 01:41:53.425]  You know what I mean?
[01:41:53.445 --> 01:41:57.428]  We're just trying to help a kid and experience something that we hadn't experienced before.
[01:41:57.488 --> 01:42:02.131]  And then jumping into raising a teenager with a lot of problems is a lot to bite off already.
[01:42:02.871 --> 01:42:10.716]  But, you know, we went through quite a bit to get them the court order to lower the amount of Adderall.
[01:42:11.116 --> 01:42:15.159]  And here's something I'd like to say, and I know this is probably an extremely irresponsible thing to say.
[01:42:16.359 --> 01:42:27.264]  Uh, and a lot of, it's probably a bad thing to say and a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but I believe that anybody who's going to give mind-altering drugs to a little child should have to take them first themselves.
[01:42:27.284 --> 01:42:28.384]  I think that's a great thing.
[01:42:28.404 --> 01:42:29.225]  I just think, you know what?
[01:42:29.745 --> 01:42:30.145]  You know what?
[01:42:30.605 --> 01:42:35.407]  I just don't think you should hand Paxil to some little kid and then wonder why he's like trying to tear his hair out.
[01:42:35.467 --> 01:42:36.608]  Why don't you take it first?
[01:42:37.248 --> 01:42:38.789]  And then maybe it would make sense.
[01:42:39.049 --> 01:42:44.451]  Or, you know, I took one little speck of this Adderall and I thought I was going to have a heart attack.
[01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:45.171]  I'm not kidding you.
[01:42:45.191 --> 01:42:50.034]  And this was just, like, not even a crumb of what this little child was taking every day.
[01:42:50.234 --> 01:42:53.775]  Oh my God, and then it makes them calm later once they burn out.
[01:42:54.295 --> 01:42:55.596]  It kills brain cells.
[01:42:56.076 --> 01:42:59.901]  And it usually ends up making them want to become addicted to cocaine.
[01:42:59.921 --> 01:43:01.103]  Hey, I took speed twice.
[01:43:01.604 --> 01:43:03.206]  You know, in high school, people would talk me into it.
[01:43:03.226 --> 01:43:04.147]  That's why I never did hard drugs.
[01:43:04.227 --> 01:43:04.568]  I tried.
[01:43:04.588 --> 01:43:07.372]  I was like, I'm up for two days, and then I vomit for another day.
[01:43:07.392 --> 01:43:10.997]  And I want to like, you know, basically get in fistfights with people.
[01:43:11.397 --> 01:43:12.338]  I mean, this is hellish.
[01:43:13.223 --> 01:43:24.756]  Yeah, no, and it carves out a place in your brain that is going to basically make you an addict later in life because you... The studies show you're four times more likely to be a drug addict after they put you on this stuff.
[01:43:24.776 --> 01:43:26.117]  Yeah, so they know what they're doing.
[01:43:26.518 --> 01:43:30.182]  70% roughly of foster kids are on up to seven drugs.
[01:43:30.823 --> 01:43:31.764]  But yeah, get into the film.
[01:43:31.784 --> 01:43:32.445]  We've got some clips.
[01:43:32.465 --> 01:43:33.606]  What clips you want to go to first?
[01:43:33.786 --> 01:43:37.147]  Well, let's start the one about foster children before we get into talking about marijuana.
[01:43:37.207 --> 01:43:44.048]  So the this first clip is just like a minute and a half or so about my wife and I fostering this child.
[01:43:44.128 --> 01:43:45.088]  And and then her.
[01:43:45.468 --> 01:43:48.489]  It also has her sister in there who was taken to another group home.
[01:43:48.509 --> 01:43:49.929]  But we knew her sister, too.
[01:43:50.329 --> 01:43:57.210]  And out of out of the blue, because she tried to like they quote, drowned another girl in a pool when they were just playing in a swimming pool.
[01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:59.811]  And she held someone else's little girl in her water.
[01:44:00.211 --> 01:44:04.776]  They diagnosed her as being schizophrenic and put her on all these powerful schizophrenia medications.
[01:44:04.836 --> 01:44:08.119]  Just never, you know, never in her whole life had been, you know, diagnosed.
[01:44:08.139 --> 01:44:10.902]  And you're an expert on that because you took care of your late brother who was schizophrenic.
[01:44:11.282 --> 01:44:12.944]  Yeah, she's not schizophrenic.
[01:44:13.144 --> 01:44:15.307]  I mean, maybe she has some emotional problems.
[01:44:15.727 --> 01:44:17.409]  Who wouldn't, if they were taken away from their parents?
[01:44:17.429 --> 01:44:21.813]  Well, putting kids on speed will make them become, what, artificially schizophrenic.
[01:44:21.853 --> 01:44:22.454]  Everybody knows that.
[01:44:22.782 --> 01:44:24.903]  Well, what about just taking a child away from their parents?
[01:44:25.043 --> 01:44:29.904]  I think taking a child away from their parents, like what child is not going to be traumatized from that?
[01:44:30.004 --> 01:44:32.705]  It's a completely traumatic experience.
[01:44:33.886 --> 01:44:35.486]  And so they start handing these kids drugs.
[01:44:35.506 --> 01:44:37.907]  And by the way, since you raised this point, I didn't even know about it.
[01:44:37.927 --> 01:44:40.368]  We've talked about the film and I'm sure people have seen it out in L.A.
[01:44:41.248 --> 01:44:42.449]  Uh, you know, the rough cuts.
[01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:49.151]  You know, you bring up what trolls say about, oh, he put a foster kid now that, you know, she's gone back to her mother and you've got an authorization to put her in the film.
[01:44:49.451 --> 01:44:50.152]  He put her in the film.
[01:44:50.192 --> 01:44:51.072]  He did this to put her in a film.
[01:44:51.512 --> 01:44:57.535]  I remember the last six, seven years, all the incarnations about prisons and enslaving and marijuana.
[01:44:58.015 --> 01:45:01.836]  And then I remember you telling me, now I'm going this direction because I discovered all this.
[01:45:01.977 --> 01:45:02.957]  Oh my God, you're right.
[01:45:03.277 --> 01:45:03.957]  It's all true.
[01:45:04.017 --> 01:45:04.858]  It's so horrible.
[01:45:05.218 --> 01:45:10.260]  In fact, you even told me a few months ago, you said you didn't fully believe me about the CPS and stuff before.
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:18.483]  No, and it's crazy, but the thing is, is that when you get into it, you know, it's not like any of these people are evil.
[01:45:19.363 --> 01:45:21.684]  I mean, we have these people in my house all the time.
[01:45:21.724 --> 01:45:23.245]  I'm friends with a lot of these people.
[01:45:23.305 --> 01:45:25.886]  We have case workers and social workers and county workers.
[01:45:25.926 --> 01:45:28.967]  I mean, the foster child we're taking care of now, she's 16 years old.
[01:45:29.507 --> 01:45:30.468]  I'm not kidding you, Alex.
[01:45:30.508 --> 01:45:34.229]  She has 20, 20 people that work for her.
[01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:35.710]  It is insane.
[01:45:35.730 --> 01:45:38.091]  We go to these meetings where, like, it's literally like
[01:45:38.651 --> 01:45:47.318]  20 people around a table that, you know, I'm the intern for her social workers, you know, management company, and they're all making money off this one child.
[01:45:47.718 --> 01:45:51.902]  And so the more problems, too, it's like, oh, she lost her temper, we gotta, like, up her level of care.
[01:45:51.922 --> 01:45:57.646]  Oh, they're at a pool and a little kid fell off and went under, tried to murder him, that we're gonna put you on an antipsychotic.
[01:45:58.106 --> 01:45:58.627]  Exactly.
[01:45:58.687 --> 01:45:59.467]  It's that fast.
[01:45:59.648 --> 01:46:00.308]  It's that fast.
[01:46:00.368 --> 01:46:02.210]  I mean, they just, they don't even question it.
[01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:04.791]  Okay, so what's this first clip we're going to play?
[01:46:04.811 --> 01:46:05.371]  Exclusive?
[01:46:05.472 --> 01:46:13.496]  Yeah, this is about us fostering this little girl and we interview her sister as well.
[01:46:13.856 --> 01:46:18.039]  And just for the record, you know, her mother has become an activist.
[01:46:18.139 --> 01:46:20.920]  She's back with her mother now and it's all good.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:22.861]  And they, believe me, they want to be in this.
[01:46:22.962 --> 01:46:25.603]  And by the way, that's what you've worked to do is get them back with their parents.
[01:46:25.903 --> 01:46:28.525]  You're telling me, can you say what you told me off record about how
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:33.385]  I mean, the system doesn't really want kids back with their parents, do they?
[01:46:33.928 --> 01:46:34.848]  Yeah, no, they fight it.
[01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:38.150]  And, you know, we even get messages about, like, how bad they're doing all the time.
[01:46:38.210 --> 01:46:40.450]  And then we check in with them and they're like, no, we're doing good.
[01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:49.193]  And it's kind of like... No, no, the system doesn't want you... Look, folks, they take people's kids that fall off jungle gyms and break their finger at school.
[01:46:49.854 --> 01:46:58.977]  And then they start an investigation at the hospital and then come to your house and find a dirty plate and take your kid for that when the kid breaks their finger at the school.
[01:46:59.357 --> 01:47:00.697]  I know someone that happened with.
[01:47:00.917 --> 01:47:01.638]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:47:01.658 --> 01:47:01.998]  Here it is.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:07.644]  But if I wanted to become a foster dad, I was no longer allowed to use my homegrown remedy.
[01:47:08.685 --> 01:47:14.450]  Weekly searches of our home by seasoned California caseworkers with sensitive noses kept me on the up and up.
[01:47:17.807 --> 01:47:18.707]  We're not allowed to smoke pot.
[01:47:18.928 --> 01:47:24.951]  Right before Christmas, the agency sent my wife and I an 11-year-old girl whose mother had been in prison for several years.
[01:47:25.851 --> 01:47:33.315]  Along with our new foster daughter, Stephanie, came prescriptions for the powerful amphetamine Adderall and a very powerful antidepressant sleeping pill.
[01:47:34.534 --> 01:47:39.778]  Before becoming our foster daughter, Stephanie had been living in a home with ten other children for over three years.
[01:47:39.878 --> 01:47:40.178]  Wow!
[01:47:40.618 --> 01:47:44.361]  During that time, she was regularly sedated and put to bed by 7 p.m.
[01:47:44.821 --> 01:47:46.362]  and then woken up at 6 a.m.
[01:47:46.402 --> 01:47:50.905]  with Adderall in order to go to school, as were most of the other children living in the home.
[01:47:50.925 --> 01:47:51.706]  You saved a victim!
[01:47:52.286 --> 01:47:58.691]  Newly diagnosed as being schizophrenic and drugged accordingly, Stephanie's sister, Brittany, was also placed in foster care.
[01:47:59.191 --> 01:48:03.959]  I started the medication in the group home but before I had the medication I was good.
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:10.008]  I was good but then I don't know what happened and they just put me on medication.
[01:48:13.211 --> 01:48:17.032]  As foster parents, the more problems we could list our child with, the more we got paid.
[01:48:17.652 --> 01:48:22.453]  If a child throws something or makes a threatening gesture, we could raise their category of care.
[01:48:22.954 --> 01:48:29.855]  More drugs for the child equals more money for everyone, including the agencies, doctors, and on a grand scale, the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:48:30.936 --> 01:48:32.076]  We don't drug our children.
[01:48:32.716 --> 01:48:36.037]  We raise our children and nurture them and take care of them.
[01:48:36.497 --> 01:48:39.958]  But the institutions that they end up in do it.
[01:48:40.888 --> 01:48:43.852]  Just to keep the log jam from getting worse, you know?
[01:48:44.233 --> 01:48:49.640]  I'm 11 years old, and I feel kind of sad being taken away from my mom.
[01:48:50.821 --> 01:48:52.384]  And I didn't know it would be like that.
[01:48:52.404 --> 01:48:56.950]  And I've been in foster care for so long, I'm ready to go home.
[01:48:57.816 --> 01:48:58.076]  Wow.
[01:48:58.436 --> 01:49:13.901]  You know, Kevin, you've got, you're doing something no one's ever done, and I think there's a reason you obsessed over this film for, it's been seven years, the other one took three, this is seven, and, or six and a half, and I mean, you really stumbled into something big here, and the fact that you're able to show this is just amazing.
[01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:15.830]  Yeah, I know.
[01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:19.213]  It's taken some time, you know.
[01:49:19.253 --> 01:49:21.295]  You have to put in the time to do a story like this.
[01:49:21.375 --> 01:49:25.918]  I mean, you know, we couldn't have just put this out while the girls were still in the foster system.
[01:49:25.938 --> 01:49:29.941]  We had to make sure that these girls got out of the foster system before we could tell this story.
[01:49:30.001 --> 01:49:34.224]  And so, it was, you know, it was about a three-year plan just to tell the fun story of this girl.
[01:49:34.244 --> 01:49:34.865]  And the before and after.
[01:49:34.885 --> 01:49:38.308]  I've seen, like, three-year-olds grabbed by the foster system, totally healthy, happy.
[01:49:38.688 --> 01:49:40.489]  Six months later, their teeth have fallen out.
[01:49:40.729 --> 01:49:42.091]  They have black circles around their eyes.
[01:49:42.111 --> 01:49:43.752]  They look like concentration camp victims.
[01:49:43.772 --> 01:49:45.213]  Because you cried for mommy!
[01:49:45.333 --> 01:49:46.173]  They put you on drugs.
[01:49:46.354 --> 01:49:49.975]  Oh, yeah, and the average foster home is not like our house.
[01:49:50.055 --> 01:50:02.082]  I mean, we're the, you know, I'm not sitting here bragging and saying we got some great house, but trust me, the average foster home is... No, you got a nice pad, but the whole point is, listen, for a summer, I worked for a major carpet cleaner.
[01:50:02.782 --> 01:50:03.563]  And this is when I was 18.
[01:50:03.643 --> 01:50:06.706]  And my dad's like, get out of the house and get another job.
[01:50:06.786 --> 01:50:09.149]  You know, I don't care if you don't have enough with one job, get two jobs.
[01:50:09.429 --> 01:50:10.971]  You're not going to be, you know, that's good.
[01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:11.932]  You'll throw you out of the nest.
[01:50:12.472 --> 01:50:17.658]  And I got that job because it was a place where I could get paid 15 bucks an hour back then because it was rough work.
[01:50:17.678 --> 01:50:19.159]  You know, the apprentice got paid like 15.
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:21.101]  They had guys like 25.
[01:50:21.382 --> 01:50:22.122]  You'd be there helping.
[01:50:22.142 --> 01:50:23.884]  And let me tell you, I had to go to the foster houses.
[01:50:24.185 --> 01:50:25.146]  I'm like, what are these?
[01:50:25.626 --> 01:50:33.829]  And it'd be like some three-bedroom house with kids that, you know, you'd see like cages where they were locking them up, a dirty mattress, kids that look like zombies.
[01:50:34.110 --> 01:50:40.272]  It would always be like some weird pot-bellied guy that, you know, now I know probably like a pedophile was, you know, wandering around.
[01:50:40.292 --> 01:50:43.753]  And then they won't investigate them because that's their people.
[01:50:44.234 --> 01:50:46.855]  And they've passed the little tests.
[01:50:47.799 --> 01:50:51.083]  Yeah, and cops out there, you get to go in houses, you know, and plumbers.
[01:50:51.444 --> 01:50:53.827]  Let me tell you, it's service people that see all this stuff, man.
[01:50:54.228 --> 01:50:58.433]  And I mean, let me tell you, please, we'll be right back with Kevin Booth.
[01:50:59.034 --> 01:50:59.495]  Absolutely.
[01:51:01.348 --> 01:51:04.969]  Gardeners, here comes another growing season, but don't use last year's soil.

[01:52:01.096 --> 01:52:02.997]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:52:03.037 --> 01:52:05.277]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:52:05.437 --> 01:52:10.639]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:52:10.859 --> 01:52:14.620]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:18.621]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:52:18.782 --> 01:52:19.962]  The fact is, you are.
[01:52:20.162 --> 01:52:20.942]  We all are.
[01:52:21.182 --> 01:52:23.503]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[01:53:34.494 --> 01:53:40.219]  If Obama has his way, all guns will be either banned, restricted or confiscated, possibly by executive order.
[01:53:40.699 --> 01:53:42.900]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[01:53:43.061 --> 01:53:45.542]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away.

[01:54:01.448 --> 01:54:07.213]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska Go north for Russia's home
[01:54:15.535 --> 01:54:41.040]  Folks, I go covering news for years locally in Austin would have families contact me and I would go and see the CPS take their newborn baby for no reason and file it with the county clerk with different names and a three-year-old filing just so lazy the social workers I saw that they would get I would go to court and there would be a different name on the paperwork and you know they abused the three-year-old
[01:54:42.307 --> 01:54:47.374]  And I'd be there in court, not allowed to talk, and people would be like, they'd have a public, you know, defender in the fake court.
[01:54:47.414 --> 01:54:48.696]  It's not even a real court, not a jury.
[01:54:49.156 --> 01:54:49.737]  Family court.
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:51.580]  I actually saw this happen.
[01:54:52.041 --> 01:55:08.366]  I show these documents on AXS TV, this is like 16 years ago, and one of the cases, I'm having flashbacks to this because it was such a wake-up call, and they would go, because you abused the three-year-old, it would be someone else's name, we're taking this one, and they'd go, who is my first child?
[01:55:08.406 --> 01:55:10.647]  They'd go, psychiatric evaluation!
[01:55:10.667 --> 01:55:12.008]  Psychiatric evaluation!
[01:55:12.768 --> 01:55:16.791]  And, I mean, they would just take their kid, because it was blonde-haired, blue-eyed, and they could get a top dollar.
[01:55:17.512 --> 01:55:18.533]  And I don't know about the L.A.
[01:55:18.573 --> 01:55:18.873]  system.
[01:55:18.893 --> 01:55:20.615]  I've read it's pretty darn bad as well.
[01:55:20.635 --> 01:55:21.815]  They're in Southern California.
[01:55:22.476 --> 01:55:27.280]  But they've had the doctors over CPS go public over the kids dying from the medications.
[01:55:28.241 --> 01:55:29.842]  And it is a holocaust, folks.
[01:55:30.002 --> 01:55:32.344]  And I know so much about it.
[01:55:32.804 --> 01:55:39.510]  It frustrates me, because how do I explain it all to you if you haven't been a carpet cleaner for three months and seen it?
[01:55:41.235 --> 01:55:42.116]  I don't know.
[01:55:59.805 --> 01:56:01.967]  Oh no, they found another hurt possum in the yard.
[01:56:02.027 --> 01:56:04.530]  Now they're nursing the possum back to life, you know.
[01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:07.633]  Come over there with possums and raccoons, they're nursing back to life.
[01:56:07.893 --> 01:56:09.235]  So they wanted to help young people.
[01:56:09.595 --> 01:56:10.776]  And then they found out about this.
[01:56:10.836 --> 01:56:13.439]  And I want to commend you for your courage, Kevin.
[01:56:13.459 --> 01:56:16.782]  What's the next clip we're going to premiere here on air for folks?
[01:56:16.922 --> 01:56:17.223]  Well, thanks.
[01:56:17.243 --> 01:56:20.506]  We're going to circle back into the about children and cancer here.
[01:56:20.546 --> 01:56:22.468]  But real quick, I just wanted to talk about
[01:56:23.489 --> 01:56:25.150]  That in 2003, the U.S.
[01:56:25.210 --> 01:56:34.699]  government actually obtained the patent for medical marijuana in the form of the Department of Health and Human Services patenting cannabinoids.
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:45.408]  And this is going to lead into a thing that there is a Canadian man named Rick Simpson that discovered an age-old version of cannabis oil that cured his own cancer.
[01:56:46.409 --> 01:56:54.957]  And after he cured his cancer and thousands of other people's cancer with this ancient cannabis oil, he had to flee Canada because they raided him.
[01:56:55.898 --> 01:57:00.122]  And now a lot of people are trying to work to get this into the modern-day pharmacopoeia.
[01:57:00.862 --> 01:57:03.024]  And this brings up the main character.
[01:57:03.044 --> 01:57:07.388]  The main character in American Drug War II is a little boy named Cashy Hyde.
[01:57:08.329 --> 01:57:21.081]  And in the movie, I'm not going to give any spoiler alerts here on your show because I want people to go see the film on Channel 6, but he basically was in a coma for 40 days with a peanut-sized brain tumor.
[01:57:21.561 --> 01:57:27.366]  The hospital staff told the parents, Mike Hyde and Callie Hyde, to make funeral arrangements
[01:57:28.107 --> 01:57:53.339]  And Mike had been reading about this cannabis oil on the internet and they snuck in, his wife is actually a registered nurse, they snuck in some syringes of the cannabis oil into the emergency room in Salt Lake City and started injecting it into their dying son's feeding port, you know, just into his feeding port and literally in a day he pops out of the coma and he starts eating and then the tumor shrinks and that's kind of where our story starts.
[01:57:53.479 --> 01:57:59.103]  And Tommy Chong says he drank the oil and it made his, and years later, made his cancer go away.
[01:57:59.563 --> 01:58:03.866]  Right, so this next little clip I want to show right now is kind of called... We're going to have to play it the next hour.
[01:58:03.886 --> 01:58:12.072]  We're going to have you on for 20 more minutes and we're going to have our guest, Mr. Pinckney, in here, one of the founding Black Panther Party members, to get into the whole New World Order and everything else here today.
[01:58:12.092 --> 01:58:12.632]  But stay there, Kevin.
[01:58:12.652 --> 01:58:19.617]  We're going to get to these other four clips, exclusive premiere here of American Drug War II, picked up by, what, Warner Brothers, right, Kevin?
[01:58:20.197 --> 01:58:28.364]  Well, it's picked up by Gravitas, it's being helped promoted by Warner Brothers, and it's coming out on theatrical through a company called Tug.com that I want to tell everybody about.
[01:58:28.564 --> 01:58:32.948]  Yeah, and we're gonna tell folks, coming up, what cities it's gonna be in so you can see it first.
[01:58:33.368 --> 01:58:34.469]  Very important film.

[02:00:35.421 --> 02:00:55.377]  In the next segment, we're going to play three or four other exclusive clips here with people recovering from cancer with cannabis oil, the CPS drugging kids with deadly drugs, just inside, seven-year, really it's a ten-year investigation, but he put out American Drug War, the first one in like four years, and now this will be
[02:00:56.638 --> 02:00:57.919]  Six, seven years on this one.
[02:00:58.339 --> 02:00:59.760]  And Kevin Booth's our guest right now.
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:01.361]  Next segment, those clips are coming up.
[02:01:01.982 --> 02:01:05.004]  We're going to talk about world news and events with Larry Pinckney coming up as well.
[02:01:05.704 --> 02:01:14.410]  Kevin, what are other points people need to know about the process of seven years making a film and the different stages it went through, different things you look at in the film?
[02:01:16.872 --> 02:01:25.195]  Well, I mean, the process is basically just going out into the world and just, you know, having relationships with people.
[02:01:25.655 --> 02:01:28.056]  And, you know, these relationships take time.
[02:01:28.816 --> 02:01:35.118]  And everything, just like a fine wine, it has to go through its natural process.
[02:01:35.618 --> 02:01:38.799]  And, you know, films like these, they just can't be rushed.
[02:01:38.859 --> 02:01:41.220]  You know, I mean, like the thing about fostering the girls,
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:44.261]  You know, we couldn't just turn around and stick that out on the internet.
[02:01:44.281 --> 02:01:45.361]  We would have gotten them in trouble.
[02:01:45.441 --> 02:01:46.921]  We would have gotten in trouble.
[02:01:46.941 --> 02:01:47.821]  We would have lost them.
[02:01:47.861 --> 02:01:52.483]  So there just has to be a process to that.
[02:01:52.503 --> 02:01:56.424]  And also in this movie, we follow this young boy fighting cancer for two years.
[02:01:56.544 --> 02:02:01.605]  And so we watch a two-year battle, a two-year roller coaster ride in the film.
[02:02:02.205 --> 02:02:07.346]  So, some time goes by on this thing, and it's just been an evolution of doing this.
[02:02:07.366 --> 02:02:21.230]  You know, I also go out and I do lectures all across the country at different universities, and so just getting to talk to kids about this and what their feelings are, and you know, I guess I've tried to make myself a little bit of an expert in the field.
[02:02:21.550 --> 02:02:23.971]  That's why I just keep staying on the topic of drugs.
[02:02:26.590 --> 02:02:28.952]  It's really incredible what you've been able to put together.
[02:02:29.913 --> 02:02:32.376]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, but what are the next four clips?
[02:02:32.436 --> 02:02:33.437]  We already talked about one.
[02:02:33.537 --> 02:02:35.359]  Clip number two we're going to play coming up.
[02:02:35.399 --> 02:02:39.703]  Then you've got a bunch of other clips we're going to be premiering here today.
[02:02:39.743 --> 02:02:41.085]  Tell people about some of what's coming up.
[02:02:42.110 --> 02:03:04.834]  Well the next clip is about rediscovering cannabis oil and it just talks about this basically how just a hundred years ago this cannabis oil was in every doctor's black bag and because of the drug war how it's been demonized and that people are being refused this incredible medicine and how the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies are set up to where you can't patent a plant.
[02:03:05.074 --> 02:03:22.503]  And so therefore, what they're trying to do, and you've got the Department of Health and Human Services now has gotten a patent to cannabinoids, and this should worry people because what a lot of people believe they're going to do now is they're going to start stripping the plant down and trying to just patent just like little various things.
[02:03:22.543 --> 02:03:26.565]  So you'll have to buy this one spray to get this one aspect of the marijuana plant.
[02:03:26.585 --> 02:03:28.106]  You'll have to take this one pill.
[02:03:28.706 --> 02:03:33.790]  To get that aspect of it, instead of just being able to consume the one natural plant and get everything.
[02:03:33.810 --> 02:03:41.596]  We're also talking about GMO-ing it, and only allowing you to have the GMO, and then banning everything else, of course.
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:47.101]  Mixing it up out there.
[02:03:47.421 --> 02:03:48.762]  Yeah, yeah, your audio's cutting out a bit.
[02:03:48.782 --> 02:03:50.063]  We're going to go to break, Kevin.
[02:03:50.304 --> 02:03:51.104]  No, no, we've got another minute.
[02:03:51.124 --> 02:03:51.785]  What were you trying to say?
[02:03:52.608 --> 02:03:58.592]  I said a lot of people already believe that the GMO strains are already being mixed in with all the really high-end seeds.
[02:03:59.353 --> 02:04:08.639]  So, you know, that conspiracy has been going along for a long time now, that people believe that the GMO... By the way, you visited the big Emerald Triangle, too.
[02:04:08.659 --> 02:04:09.720]  I mean, is that going to be in the film?
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:11.960]  No, that's in the last film.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.882]  You know, I try to keep it all fresh, so I'm trying to cover things that, you know, this new film is mostly based on children.
[02:04:17.922 --> 02:04:20.623]  We also, we went to Juarez, Mexico.
[02:04:21.283 --> 02:04:27.885]  We go to a neighborhood where little boys are being recruited at $40 a pop to commit murders for cartels.
[02:04:27.905 --> 02:04:29.065]  Yeah, you have a lot of courage.
[02:04:29.105 --> 02:04:29.745]  I knew you did that.
[02:04:29.765 --> 02:04:30.426]  You're crazy.
[02:04:30.686 --> 02:04:32.706]  Yeah, I was a little crazy.
[02:04:35.587 --> 02:04:37.729]  You learned how to be crazy from the doc, didn't you?
[02:04:38.089 --> 02:04:38.890]  Yes, I did.
[02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:41.011]  Just keep... Don't turn off the camera.
[02:04:41.252 --> 02:04:46.115]  Now, I do know karate, so if the cartel started shooting at me, I'd... You'd block the bullets?
[02:04:46.275 --> 02:04:46.535]  That's right.
[02:04:46.556 --> 02:04:47.176]  Like Wonder Woman?
[02:04:47.776 --> 02:04:55.482]  I've got a green belt from the YMCA, so... Well, I mean, we all saw your karate skills in Ninja Bachelor Party.
[02:04:57.204 --> 02:04:58.064]  You're being green.
[02:04:58.104 --> 02:04:58.925]  Not too far between.
[02:04:59.045 --> 02:05:00.266]  Obviously, you can take care of that.
[02:05:01.843 --> 02:05:13.148]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.

[02:08:12.837 --> 02:08:15.381]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:17.145 --> 02:08:25.851]  You know, last hour before Kevin Booth got on with us, I showed how ridiculous it was on TV with Obama with Marines with their white gloves.
[02:08:26.331 --> 02:08:28.933]  I thought it was absurdist, you know, holding the umbrellas over them.
[02:08:29.373 --> 02:08:32.215]  I'm glad Drudge picked up on that himself, obviously.
[02:08:32.235 --> 02:08:33.176]  I mean, look at this.
[02:08:33.656 --> 02:08:35.037]  Punch it up for people watching on TV.
[02:08:35.377 --> 02:08:38.179]  Obama calls in Marines to shield him from rain.
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:44.544]  Fires IRS boss, who was leaving anyways, a complete confidence-in-holder.
[02:08:44.584 --> 02:08:46.766]  I mean, this is just all a criminal organization.
[02:08:47.266 --> 02:08:49.888]  Stage-fast and furious to blame the Second Amendment, everything.
[02:08:51.749 --> 02:08:55.512]  And White House down, set for summer release.
[02:08:55.592 --> 02:09:03.238]  All these movies where the White House is getting attacked by people so the White House can be seen as this historic, you know, heroes.
[02:09:04.921 --> 02:09:05.401]  Amazing.
[02:09:05.441 --> 02:09:06.462]  So that's just some of the news.
[02:09:07.122 --> 02:09:15.027]  If you go up to InfoWars.com, you can see all the latest news there on the site.
[02:09:16.428 --> 02:09:17.748]  We're going to go back to Kevin Booth here in a moment.
[02:09:18.208 --> 02:09:21.889]  A Senate subcommittee investigating Apple's offshore tax practices.
[02:09:21.909 --> 02:09:25.110]  How about their slave factories in China with the suicide nets?
[02:09:25.130 --> 02:09:25.990]  Because I thought they were liberal.
[02:09:26.630 --> 02:09:30.071]  A police department forced to borrow ammo from local residents.
[02:09:30.111 --> 02:09:32.551]  I haven't even gotten to that Second Amendment news yet.
[02:09:32.951 --> 02:09:38.292]  DC moves to force gun owners to buy prohibitive liability insurance.
[02:09:38.692 --> 02:09:39.712]  That is devastating.
[02:09:40.092 --> 02:09:43.093]  Comedy icon Mike Judge talks to Alex Jones, that interview.
[02:09:43.633 --> 02:09:45.374]  Teasers up there with some satire.
[02:09:45.635 --> 02:09:46.215]  Pretty powerful.
[02:09:46.235 --> 02:09:47.136]  Please get that out to everybody.
[02:09:47.616 --> 02:09:49.978]  A judge is going to get political in this interview coming up next week, folks.

[02:09:54.661 --> 02:09:59.245]  Googleberg merger ushers in Plandopolis future for hybrid age.
[02:09:59.665 --> 02:10:02.828]  Council vetoes display of English flag because it's offensive to Muslims.
[02:10:03.308 --> 02:10:04.909]  Just all part of the Balkanization.
[02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:08.172]  Obama-backed rebels carry out public executions.
[02:10:08.932 --> 02:10:10.092]  Warning, graphic video.
[02:10:10.412 --> 02:10:16.234]  That's just some of what's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:16.694 --> 02:10:19.755]  Now Larry Pinckney's coming up with the balance of the hour into some overdrive.
[02:10:20.275 --> 02:10:21.775]  Founding member of the Black Panther Party.
[02:10:21.835 --> 02:10:22.656]  Very interesting fellow.
[02:10:22.676 --> 02:10:29.737]  We appreciate him flying all the way to Austin, Texas to be here with us for a new film we're making, but it'll also be live in studio.
[02:10:29.978 --> 02:10:31.898]  Kevin, we've got like nine minutes left.
[02:10:32.098 --> 02:10:34.239]  What's the next clip we're going to and then we're going to go to it?
[02:10:34.279 --> 02:10:35.179]  For American Drug War II.
[02:10:37.278 --> 02:10:39.663]  The one about rediscovering cannabis oil.
[02:10:39.683 --> 02:10:42.349]  Yeah, let's go ahead and roll that now, Beavis.
[02:10:44.025 --> 02:10:50.607]  Callie and I started sneaking the oil into his G-tube, and they started weaning him off of all those drugs I named off.
[02:10:51.368 --> 02:10:56.069]  And over a course of two weeks, we literally pulled him off of all eight of those medications.
[02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:59.630]  We had him sitting up in bed, eating again, laughing.
[02:10:59.890 --> 02:11:03.712]  He had a quality of life that wasn't possible on the drugs they were giving him.
[02:11:04.132 --> 02:11:09.894]  And the whole time, the nurses and the doctors were saying, God, this is just miraculous that Cash is doing so well.
[02:11:10.094 --> 02:11:14.078]  So as all these doctors are saying, God, we don't understand how he survived all of this.
[02:11:14.558 --> 02:11:15.980]  This don't make any sense to us.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.601]  I pulled that patent out.
[02:11:17.742 --> 02:11:21.185]  The government has on cannabis as a neuroprotective antioxidant.
[02:11:21.525 --> 02:11:23.788]  Does cannabis really have an anti-cancer effect?
[02:11:24.328 --> 02:11:26.370]  I mean, we've seen the work of Tashkent.
[02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:28.953]  We've seen the data from the Kaiser cohort.
[02:11:29.033 --> 02:11:33.697]  There was an animal study that the National Toxicology Program did as well, where they fed
[02:11:34.585 --> 02:11:41.390]  Well, in the early 1900s, John D. Rockefeller got together with his rich friends, and they started all these medical foundations, and they took over the medical schools.
[02:11:57.422 --> 02:12:02.047]  And all they taught the doctors that were being trained is allopathic medicine.
[02:12:02.207 --> 02:12:03.729]  Medicine from chemicals and poisons.
[02:12:04.389 --> 02:12:06.771]  And of course, they owned the chemical plants.
[02:12:07.432 --> 02:12:09.714]  And you know, what a great way to sell their products.
[02:12:10.275 --> 02:12:13.978]  So they brainwashed the public and all these doctors into believing that this was the way to go.
[02:12:14.519 --> 02:12:18.583]  When in reality, the only thing that actually heals, you know, is empiric medicine.
[02:12:18.623 --> 02:12:19.524]  Medicine from plants.
[02:12:20.154 --> 02:12:27.042]  And old John D. Rockefeller himself, as I understand it, he lived to be almost 100 years old, and he wouldn't even take his own medicine.
[02:12:27.623 --> 02:12:30.125]  What he took was empiric medicine, medicine from plants.
[02:12:30.885 --> 02:12:33.547]  But they didn't mind, you know, selling the chemicals to us, did they?
[02:12:34.047 --> 02:12:42.554]  The pharmaceutical company and the way that they operate, it has to be a molecule, you know, no more than five molecules, in fact, to make up a drug to get approved through the FDA.
[02:12:42.894 --> 02:12:44.815]  Cannabis absolutely does not qualify.
[02:12:44.835 --> 02:12:53.602]  I think the pharmaceutical company figured out, well, this extremely popular plant medicine that everybody could grow in their backyard is not available for us to make profit at this time.
[02:12:54.295 --> 02:13:07.045]  We have this interesting balance occurring as maturation of individuals fulfill their kind of cannabis destiny, whether or not they produce enough to be open-minded or closed-minded.
[02:13:07.585 --> 02:13:15.411]  And if you look historically at the nature of mankind, we've been ruled by people quite clearly that are what I would call on high people.
[02:13:16.750 --> 02:13:19.011]  Again, Kevin Booth, Patriot.
[02:13:19.091 --> 02:13:21.712]  You can hear him going after the Rockefellers in this with the history.
[02:13:22.132 --> 02:13:25.014]  And this is getting picked up for distribution to be on cable.
[02:13:25.454 --> 02:13:29.135]  His other stuff has been on, what, Showtime, HBO, you name it.
[02:13:29.636 --> 02:13:30.896]  Now getting picked up.
[02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:31.717]  It's very important.
[02:13:32.057 --> 02:13:33.657]  This gets seen in theaters everywhere.
[02:13:33.938 --> 02:13:36.119]  Where do people go to see the first theaters and things?
[02:13:36.159 --> 02:13:42.721]  If it sells out at those theaters, then folks, they'll book it in other theaters, just like Obama 2016 and others.
[02:13:44.782 --> 02:13:45.943]  Yeah, give people the date, Kevin.
[02:13:47.250 --> 02:13:47.430]  Yeah.
[02:13:48.330 --> 02:13:58.474]  Right, it's June 6th, and if you go to americandrugwar2.com or just americandrugwar.com or americandrugwar2.com and look for the screenings through a company called Tug out of Austin.
[02:13:58.994 --> 02:14:02.355]  I want to make sure everybody's at the LA screening, everybody's at the Austin screening.
[02:14:02.375 --> 02:14:04.315]  It'll also be done through Brave New Books.
[02:14:05.096 --> 02:14:10.077]  But you gotta buy your tickets in advance to make sure that the theater books.
[02:14:10.137 --> 02:14:12.598]  So I need everybody to get out there and buy tickets immediately.
[02:14:12.618 --> 02:14:14.579]  That's right, you buy them and if it doesn't book, you get your money back.
[02:14:14.619 --> 02:14:15.079]  But it's all good.
[02:14:15.939 --> 02:14:17.720]  No, no, the problem is this is going to sell out.
[02:14:17.981 --> 02:14:19.061]  Your stuff always sells out.
[02:14:19.382 --> 02:14:22.044]  Well, there's theaters all across the country, so go in there.
[02:14:22.104 --> 02:14:25.426]  I'll take you to this website, and there's theaters all over Florida, New York.
[02:14:25.446 --> 02:14:33.192]  We've got theaters booked everywhere, but we've got to sell all the tickets, or we've got to sell enough tickets by May 30th, so please get out there and buy the tickets immediately.
[02:14:33.312 --> 02:14:35.494]  And again, folks, I'm not making any money off of this.
[02:14:35.554 --> 02:14:42.139]  I'm doing this because I want this film to be a hit, because I want to save the children that they're murdering with prescription drugs via the CPS.
[02:14:42.539 --> 02:14:43.359]  Let's go to the next clip.
[02:14:43.379 --> 02:14:44.280]  We're almost out of time, Kevin.
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:45.161]  Tell people the next clip.
[02:14:45.712 --> 02:14:50.455]  Uh, just basically the torture that kids are still going through and that we're using chemo stuff from the 1970s.
[02:14:50.575 --> 02:14:53.537]  This is a continuation of the little Cash Hive story.
[02:14:53.577 --> 02:14:54.418]  There it is.
[02:14:54.438 --> 02:14:56.019]  The next clip.
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:06.945]  Cashie's mom, Callie, is a registered nurse, and although some say it's not necessary, she always insists that the oil be sterilized at a professional laboratory.
[02:15:08.106 --> 02:15:12.829]  Cashie looks really good today.
[02:15:13.362 --> 02:15:19.086]  Mike shares one of the many regrettable situations that Cashy and many other children with cancer commonly endure.
[02:15:19.106 --> 02:15:24.249]  They weren't even going to try and remove his infected port until Sunday.
[02:15:24.269 --> 02:15:26.430]  I had to actually tell them that they were stupid.
[02:15:27.431 --> 02:15:35.516]  So every day they had to pull this patch off of his chest and they had to pull the gauze stuff into the wound hole that was in it.
[02:15:38.715 --> 02:15:41.818]  Now that's fighting cancer with the American Cancer Society.
[02:15:42.479 --> 02:15:45.441]  That's fighting cancer with the pediatric oncology floors.
[02:15:46.042 --> 02:15:54.930]  This is the answer that all of our prosecutors, sheriffs, police officers, governors, this is what they say to be the best way for our kids.
[02:15:55.051 --> 02:15:56.252]  It's all on purpose, folks.
[02:15:57.853 --> 02:15:58.674]  I say bullshit.
[02:15:59.955 --> 02:16:00.476]  Bleep that.
[02:16:00.656 --> 02:16:01.617]  That's torture, man.
[02:16:03.703 --> 02:16:09.946]  Have you ever seen a person who had cancer and used marijuana to help them eat or to alleviate their condition?
[02:16:11.806 --> 02:16:14.727]  Somebody suffering from terminal cancer?
[02:16:15.568 --> 02:16:16.228]  No, I have not.
[02:16:16.628 --> 02:16:29.974]  And if you had, and I have, and seen that it helps them with their appetite and makes them smile, would you agree that it has some benefit to society for somebody who's dying and that marijuana is the only thing that makes them eat and makes them smile?
[02:16:30.594 --> 02:16:33.335]  Is there not an efficacious situation there?
[02:16:34.896 --> 02:16:36.924]  I think that's between him and his doctor.
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:44.144]  Well, if it's between him and his doctor, why does the DEA take a position that medical marijuana is wrong, which you've taken.
[02:16:44.404 --> 02:16:46.546]  You've taken the position it's not between him and his doctor.
[02:16:46.586 --> 02:16:54.871]  You have a publication, which on page 6 of your publication in 2011, has the most insane and banal paragraph.
[02:16:55.111 --> 02:16:58.974]  The legalization movement is not simply a harmless academic exercise.
[02:16:59.014 --> 02:17:02.456]  The moral danger of thinking marijuana is... Gentleman's time has expired.
[02:17:02.516 --> 02:17:04.818]  The gentlewoman from California, Ms.
[02:17:04.918 --> 02:17:05.118]  Chu.
[02:17:07.082 --> 02:17:09.603]  Ladies and gentlemen, the cancer viruses are in the vaccine.
[02:17:09.643 --> 02:17:12.124]  Pediatric cancers sometimes are up 10,000 percent.
[02:17:12.364 --> 02:17:13.525]  They're killing all of us.
[02:17:13.865 --> 02:17:20.107]  And because they make money, they give you the cancer, and then they go and suck all the money out of you while they kill you and your family.
[02:17:20.347 --> 02:17:23.889]  And then they'll now take your kids and take them and do medical experiments on them.
[02:17:24.649 --> 02:17:26.050]  I mean, this is unbelievable, Kevin.
[02:17:27.045 --> 02:17:42.500]  Yeah I know and a lot of the footage that you're seeing this thing this this was hidden camera footage that the family actually you know we're filming off their iPhones and so forth without the hospital's knowledge so there's a lot of a lot of footage in this movie you're not going to see anywhere else and I think it's very interesting at that
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:43.060]  It's amazing.
[02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:44.240]  Now we've got one more clip here.
[02:17:44.340 --> 02:17:46.881]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip right now.
[02:17:46.981 --> 02:17:47.881]  Here's the final clip.
[02:18:14.346 --> 02:18:17.047]  And then we'll get Kevin's comment on the final clip on that.
[02:18:17.067 --> 02:18:22.188]  There are only three groups of which I'm aware that are very interested in keeping marijuana illegal.
[02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:23.948]  They're the police.
[02:18:24.368 --> 02:18:25.428]  A lot of people know about them.
[02:18:25.969 --> 02:18:34.090]  And that tends to take the form of chiefs of police, police unions trying to hold on to overtime pay, prisons, private prison industry.
[02:18:35.251 --> 02:18:36.151]  The other is cartels.
[02:18:37.351 --> 02:18:40.612]  Because cartels make 70% of their profits from marijuana sales alone.
[02:18:41.368 --> 02:18:47.891]  I was lucky enough to cross the bridge into Juarez with veteran journalists Brett and Craig Renault who report for the New York Times.
[02:18:48.891 --> 02:19:05.038]  The battle between the police and the cartels is really heated up and the cartels are saying they're going to kill one police officer every day and in the last month and a half they have killed about 19 local police officers here and just last night in this area two more were killed.
[02:19:06.192 --> 02:19:11.773]  The brutally poor circumstances of Juarez make many of the children perfect marks for cartel recruitment.
[02:19:12.153 --> 02:19:15.734]  If you don't want to go into the cartel, they won't force you.
[02:19:16.454 --> 02:19:19.555]  They like for you to go by yourself.
[02:19:20.175 --> 02:19:26.616]  Because if they force you, you can go and tell the police and they will help you sometimes.
[02:19:27.276 --> 02:19:31.877]  But if you go by yourself, they will ask you to do anything and you will do it.
[02:19:33.035 --> 02:19:37.419]  And they give you a transponder number to squawk that's a little off the norm.
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:40.881]  And so an ATC... Alright, folks, listen.
[02:19:40.982 --> 02:19:43.303]  I'll have to air the rest of this tonight on the Nightly News.
[02:19:43.363 --> 02:19:46.086]  Thank you, Kevin Booth, for premiering this year.
[02:19:46.566 --> 02:19:49.008]  I congratulate you on your courage and your great work.
[02:19:49.308 --> 02:19:54.092]  People can find out more at americandrugwar2.com to get these screened all over the country.
[02:19:54.392 --> 02:19:55.293]  Great job, Kevin.
[02:19:55.313 --> 02:19:56.814]  This is a revolutionary thing you've done.
[02:19:56.834 --> 02:19:59.677]  We have another revolutionary against tyranny coming in after the break.
[02:20:01.411 --> 02:20:03.353]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:20:03.793 --> 02:20:06.515]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:20:07.096 --> 02:20:12.720]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will shock you.
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:21.067]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:20:22.108 --> 02:20:25.172]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:20:25.452 --> 02:20:27.294]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:20:27.615 --> 02:20:34.604]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:20:35.105 --> 02:20:39.590]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:20:40.091 --> 02:20:45.993]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:20:46.313 --> 02:20:47.093]  You'll be shocked.
[02:20:47.654 --> 02:20:52.375]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[02:20:52.875 --> 02:20:57.937]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:20:58.337 --> 02:20:59.698]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:21:01.477 --> 02:21:08.539]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.
[02:21:08.859 --> 02:21:17.181]  Microplant powder can help unclog arteries and soften heart valves while removing heavy metals, virus, fungus, bacteria, and parasites.
[02:21:17.381 --> 02:21:20.922]  Plus it cleans and purifies the blood, lungs, stomach, and colon.
[02:21:21.082 --> 02:21:24.062]  Keep your body clean with Microplant Powder.
[02:21:24.463 --> 02:21:25.843]  Order today at 888-910-4367 or visit HempUSA.org.
[02:21:30.646 --> 02:21:31.707]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.887 --> 02:21:36.270]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:36.430 --> 02:21:42.154]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:42.254 --> 02:21:45.676]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.896 --> 02:21:48.498]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.618 --> 02:21:53.541]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:53.681 --> 02:21:53.962]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.982 --> 02:21:55.323]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.026 --> 02:22:02.227]  Hi, my name is Steven Heuer.
[02:22:02.387 --> 02:22:05.568]  As a degreed nutritionist, my first priority is for you to get healthy.
[02:22:05.808 --> 02:22:10.469]  That won't happen if I make wrong recommendations or cause you to spend money on supplements you don't need.
[02:22:10.749 --> 02:22:16.731]  After 20 years working with thousands of products and thousands of people, I know, for the most part, what does and does not work.
[02:22:17.091 --> 02:22:22.713]  One World Whey is the first and only unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows on the market.
[02:22:22.873 --> 02:22:26.114]  It retains substances that no other whey protein powder has.
[02:22:26.494 --> 02:22:29.536]  These nutritive compounds supply life-giving nutrition.

[02:24:03.915 --> 02:24:06.917]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[02:24:06.997 --> 02:24:10.258]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[02:24:15.222 --> 02:24:18.445]  There's a big Forbes article out today.
[02:24:18.486 --> 02:24:22.550]  Disarming realities as gun sales soar, gun crimes plummet.
[02:24:36.533 --> 02:24:40.118]  And of course we've been hammering on this forever and now those statistics are getting out.
[02:24:40.619 --> 02:24:46.007]  Hardcore statistics that the system doesn't want you to know about and the criminals that work for the government don't want you to know about.
[02:24:46.966 --> 02:24:53.975]  Meanwhile, the bullet shortage is so bad, police chief has citizens for ammo, gets a 1,500 round loan amid strong public response.
[02:24:54.015 --> 02:24:57.239]  The evil public up in Minnesota, in Proctor, Minnesota.
[02:24:58.020 --> 02:25:01.624]  DC considers quarter million dollar insurance policy for gun buyers.
[02:25:01.944 --> 02:25:02.846]  Next it'll be a million.
[02:25:03.246 --> 02:25:05.929]  So if they can't get your guns one way, they'll get them the other.
[02:25:06.929 --> 02:25:08.070]  That's just some of what we have.
[02:25:08.530 --> 02:25:16.373]  And joining us for the rest of the hour and then into some overdrive today is Larry Pinckney with Black Activist WG.org.
[02:25:16.493 --> 02:25:22.196]  He also is the editor, editorial board member of blackcommentator.com, a great news site.
[02:25:22.936 --> 02:25:24.817]  And, of course, he is a veteran Black Panther Party.
[02:25:24.837 --> 02:25:25.617]  They're at its founding.
[02:25:25.637 --> 02:25:38.900]  The former Minister of the Interior of the Republic of New Africa, a former political prisoner, and the only American to have successfully self-offered his civil political rights case to the United Nations under the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights.
[02:25:39.701 --> 02:25:48.083]  And he, of course, has been a guest on PBS, you name it, and documentaries about COINTELPRO, how the government targets people with dirty tricks like
[02:25:48.723 --> 02:25:57.129]  Having people get behind me and yell, kill Michelle Malkin, and the phone rings and it's the Denver Post and National TV saying, why'd you say killer?
[02:25:57.769 --> 02:26:09.056]  They had, it was all a setup, and luckily we had video and it came out it was a setup, and then now with the Austin gun rally they had somebody run up and cuss right behind the pro-gun people to then blame us.
[02:26:09.757 --> 02:26:12.218]  These are the tactics, and that's light COINTELPRO.
[02:26:13.379 --> 02:26:15.442]  Thank you for coming to Austin, Texas.
[02:26:15.482 --> 02:26:17.004]  Larry Pinckney, it's great to have you here.
[02:26:17.024 --> 02:26:20.088]  This is a short segment, but I asked you, I said, what do you want to get into first?
[02:26:20.429 --> 02:26:22.572]  The wars, the scandals, the government running Al Qaeda?
[02:26:22.973 --> 02:26:25.336]  You go, no, I want to talk about the Second Amendment first.
[02:26:25.716 --> 02:26:27.279]  And so let's talk about that, Larry Pinckney.
[02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:30.331]  Well, first of all, I want to thank you very, very much, Alex.
[02:26:30.391 --> 02:26:32.872]  It's a pleasure being here in Austin, Texas.
[02:26:32.972 --> 02:26:36.853]  It's a fantastic job that all of you are doing.
[02:26:36.893 --> 02:26:37.333]  We're trying.
[02:26:37.593 --> 02:26:38.534]  It is fantastic.
[02:26:38.774 --> 02:26:40.294]  So let me just get right into it.
[02:26:40.835 --> 02:26:47.137]  As far as the Second Amendment is concerned, that is to say, the right to defend ourselves.
[02:26:47.577 --> 02:26:50.979]  We're not just talking about bearing arms, we're saying the right to defend ourselves.
[02:26:51.039 --> 02:26:55.502]  It was the reason that the Second Amendment came into being.
[02:26:55.522 --> 02:26:57.083]  It didn't happen by osmosis.
[02:26:57.784 --> 02:27:11.813]  We have to understand that if we are not able to defend ourselves, everyday ordinary black, white, brown, red, yellow people, American citizens, we are in deep trouble if the government
[02:27:12.981 --> 02:27:18.785]  For example, the Department of Homeland Security, which has been gathering munitions, you name it.
[02:27:19.006 --> 02:27:21.968]  Well, who are they going to use those munitions and ammunition against?
[02:27:22.608 --> 02:27:24.129]  It's not a foreign agency.
[02:27:24.390 --> 02:27:30.394]  It has to be against... The training manuals say it's for anybody that, quote, promotes the Constitution.
[02:27:30.994 --> 02:27:32.035]  And what does that tell us?
[02:27:32.255 --> 02:27:36.178]  Apparently it tells us that the Constitution has been made null and void.
[02:27:36.519 --> 02:27:39.581]  It means anybody that wants a check on unlimited power is the enemy.
[02:27:39.781 --> 02:27:40.721]  Right, right.
[02:27:41.082 --> 02:27:47.204]  So, I wanted to, and I thank you for asking me, I wanted to begin by this, at this stage.
[02:27:47.645 --> 02:27:55.988]  Being one of the veterans of the Black Panther Party, the party was founded in October 1966 in Oakland, California.
[02:27:56.149 --> 02:27:58.990]  I joined the party in 1967, the following year.
[02:27:59.490 --> 02:28:01.411]  But however, I want people to remember this.
[02:28:01.911 --> 02:28:07.514]  By the end of the 1980s, in fact even before, frankly,
[02:28:08.254 --> 02:28:15.017]  The Black Panther Party for self-defense had been absolutely, physically decimated.
[02:28:15.657 --> 02:28:19.519]  Murders by and from the federal government.
[02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:22.441]  I'm also talking about set-ups.
[02:28:22.561 --> 02:28:24.461]  I'm talking about discreditation.
[02:28:24.882 --> 02:28:29.344]  I'm talking about every vile, vicious, despicable tactic.
[02:28:29.464 --> 02:28:30.364]  Infiltrations.
[02:28:30.384 --> 02:28:31.425]  Infiltrations.
[02:28:32.745 --> 02:28:33.566]  And people died.
[02:28:33.626 --> 02:28:34.786]  Many, many people died.
[02:28:34.846 --> 02:28:36.067]  Families were destroyed.
[02:28:36.747 --> 02:28:38.848]  This is what we need to understand.
[02:28:38.868 --> 02:28:40.189]  I don't care what our color is.
[02:28:40.269 --> 02:28:41.630]  Black, white, brown, red, yellow.
[02:28:41.950 --> 02:28:45.331]  We'd better all understand that we are in this struggle together.
[02:28:45.992 --> 02:28:53.676]  And if we are to survive, we'd better do it collectively, and we'd better do it together, and we'd better stop being played off one against the other.
[02:28:54.136 --> 02:28:59.660]  We don't have to agree 100% with every... No, but if anybody has their rights taken, we all have our rights taken.
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:00.221]  That is correct.
[02:29:00.461 --> 02:29:02.583]  That is absolutely... Hang together, hang separate.
[02:29:02.603 --> 02:29:03.063]  That's right.
[02:29:03.523 --> 02:29:06.866]  And what we're going to do is we are going to be together.
[02:29:06.886 --> 02:29:08.827]  Because we are going to win this thing.
[02:29:09.188 --> 02:29:12.190]  As we said back in the day in the party, all power to the people.
[02:29:12.210 --> 02:29:15.553]  And we meant that not only figuratively, but quite literally.
[02:29:16.434 --> 02:29:25.163]  Yeah, how can you have so-called liberals today who used to say, I think wrongly, you know, kill the pigs, because we need to wake the police up as well.
[02:29:25.823 --> 02:29:29.387]  Now they're, no, give the cops all the guns, we can't have them.
[02:29:31.269 --> 02:29:32.750]  We're going to come back with Larry Pinckney.
[02:29:32.770 --> 02:29:34.752]  You can tell he's an amazing speaker in mind.
[02:29:34.772 --> 02:29:38.675]  We're going to be breaking it all down, straight ahead, in, through, and beyond.
[02:29:39.035 --> 02:29:40.637]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:29:40.997 --> 02:29:45.240]  Great job to the crew, all our affiliates, and sponsors, and you, the listeners.
[02:29:45.421 --> 02:29:47.082]  We'll be back straight ahead.
[02:29:47.142 --> 02:29:49.244]  Infowars.com.
[02:29:50.645 --> 02:29:51.546]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.046 --> 02:29:53.647]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.568 --> 02:29:57.270]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.199 --> 02:30:08.123]  For nearly 20 years, Alex has been the voice of warning on threatening issues that the big media won't dare talk about.
[02:30:08.323 --> 02:30:10.164]  Threats that trample the American dream.
[02:30:10.425 --> 02:30:12.126]  You know what we all face.
[02:30:12.346 --> 02:30:16.048]  A crashing economy that's forcing millions out of work and from their homes.
[02:30:16.268 --> 02:30:19.090]  Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[02:30:19.350 --> 02:30:22.873]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.
[02:30:23.133 --> 02:30:27.256]  The food you can trust in facing any of these threats comes from eFoods Direct.
[02:30:27.436 --> 02:30:31.499]  It tastes great and stores up to 25 years, ready for when you need it most.
[02:30:32.159 --> 02:30:32.779]  We're good to go!
[02:31:01.815 --> 02:31:07.648]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[02:33:07.567 --> 02:33:09.792]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.457 --> 02:33:26.798]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:27.238 --> 02:33:27.878]  until 2 p.m.
[02:33:27.918 --> 02:33:29.058]  Central Standard Time.
[02:33:29.579 --> 02:33:30.239]  We are here.
[02:33:30.319 --> 02:33:32.119]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:33:32.219 --> 02:33:32.780]  Larry Pinkney.
[02:33:33.460 --> 02:33:36.121]  I've been in the Black Panther Party since right after it was set up.
[02:33:36.861 --> 02:33:38.661]  Helped found chapters in different parts of the country.
[02:33:38.701 --> 02:33:40.662]  Was their, you know, spokesman.
[02:33:41.102 --> 02:33:43.563]  And was targeted, put in jail politically.
[02:33:43.603 --> 02:33:44.703]  Even came out in Congress.
[02:33:45.323 --> 02:33:48.164]  If my memory serves correctly, that he was set up politically.
[02:33:48.524 --> 02:33:51.985]  So an on-record former political prisoner here with us.
[02:33:52.045 --> 02:33:53.666]  And when he was getting to, he just joined us,
[02:33:54.326 --> 02:33:57.932]  Is that they always sell the idea of let's just take one group's rights.
[02:33:58.633 --> 02:34:00.616]  And so they say, hey, let's take the Muslims rights.
[02:34:01.237 --> 02:34:07.366]  And then now you hear it's for libertarians, conservatives, anti-war people, Tea Party, people that promote the Constitution.
[02:34:08.376 --> 02:34:12.061]  But notice the media only went with, oh, they went after conservatives and Tea Party.
[02:34:12.402 --> 02:34:15.346]  Now it turns out it was anybody promoting the Constitution.
[02:34:15.807 --> 02:34:17.149]  Oh, it was anti-war groups.
[02:34:17.229 --> 02:34:19.993]  Not fake liberal fascists, but any real liberals.
[02:34:20.213 --> 02:34:21.415]  Folks, the terms mean nothing.
[02:34:21.675 --> 02:34:23.978]  If you want justice, then you want...
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:26.961]  Basic checks and balances.
[02:34:27.341 --> 02:34:31.503]  And if you don't know history, ladies and gentlemen, for new listeners, we are becoming a tyranny.
[02:34:31.844 --> 02:34:35.686]  Now, Larry Pinckney, I don't want to rant here, because I can talk as well, but I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:34:36.046 --> 02:34:46.011]  You were saying a lot during the break, you know, the good report to people that you talk to people waking up everywhere, but finishing up the point on the Second Amendment, on hang together or hang separate, Larry Pinckney.
[02:34:46.351 --> 02:34:51.254]  You know, the fact is, is that if we do not know our history, Howard Zinn says this very well.
[02:34:51.274 --> 02:34:55.776]  He says, if you do not know your history, it's as if you were born yesterday.
[02:34:56.096 --> 02:35:04.081]  And if you were born yesterday, anyone can tell you anything who's in a position of authority, and you have no way of checking up on it.
[02:35:04.901 --> 02:35:21.788]  My purpose as a veteran of the party, as an activist continuing today in the year 2013, my purpose is to do everything that I can to wake people up, to get them to understand, all of us, that the power must rest with us collectively.
[02:35:21.908 --> 02:35:25.090]  Everyday black, white, brown, red and yellow people, everyday people.
[02:35:25.530 --> 02:35:29.672]  I was just saying to you during our break, Alex, and I'd like to say this on the air,
[02:35:30.672 --> 02:35:35.854]  That InfoWars has done and is doing an incredible job.
[02:35:36.314 --> 02:35:42.776]  I have received, and I say an incredible job, I'm talking about in terms of waking people up, making, getting people to think.
[02:35:42.976 --> 02:35:44.216]  Critically think.
[02:35:44.356 --> 02:35:45.837]  Just think for God's sakes.
[02:35:45.997 --> 02:35:47.077]  Use your common sense.
[02:35:47.177 --> 02:35:48.077]  Critically think.
[02:35:48.577 --> 02:35:50.298]  And InfoWars, it's about that.
[02:35:50.698 --> 02:35:51.478]  It's doing that.
[02:35:52.059 --> 02:35:56.080]  People, including myself, are deeply, deeply appreciative.
[02:35:56.180 --> 02:35:56.480]  Oh no!
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:57.781]  We're all in this together.
[02:35:57.801 --> 02:35:59.403]  I mean, I have no future, my children don't.
[02:35:59.724 --> 02:36:04.189]  If you don't have a future, if your family doesn't have a future, I mean, it's really such a simple equation.
[02:36:04.610 --> 02:36:08.975]  We interviewed Professor Grimm a few weeks ago out in LA, a video interview that's free online for everybody.
[02:36:09.376 --> 02:36:10.998]  He just said, look, it's the same thing.
[02:36:11.058 --> 02:36:12.119]  If I'm not free, you're not free.
[02:36:12.139 --> 02:36:15.724]  I mean, it's such a simple equation and you see the divide and conquer.
[02:36:16.184 --> 02:36:27.310]  And then you have to engage it sometimes in, hey, you've been divided and conquered, but it's still a group coming down on you because they've been programmed that that's how you get things done, and people think they're getting a power out of a group.
[02:36:27.550 --> 02:36:34.713]  How about a group that's into freedom, Bill of Rights, Constitution, due process, and the right of the people to be armed?
[02:36:34.733 --> 02:36:37.515]  I mean, that is a fundamental right, and the right of free speech.
[02:36:37.775 --> 02:36:40.156]  You know, as Bush leaves office, the whole agenda just continues.
[02:36:40.576 --> 02:36:41.357]  What do you make
[02:36:42.277 --> 02:36:51.121]  Of Obama and his foreign policy of putting Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria against countries that were actually stabilizing forces in that region.
[02:36:51.241 --> 02:37:09.989]  Well the whole point of drone man Barack Obama, let's call him what he really is, drone man Barack Obama, the whole point of Obama's policies really is to destabilize, destabilize government's countries.
[02:37:10.189 --> 02:37:10.589]  Now why?
[02:37:11.229 --> 02:37:21.252]  Because if they can destabilize it, if Obama and his minions, drone men, can do this, then they have the pretext for going into those countries.
[02:37:21.572 --> 02:37:28.235]  And by the way, there are plenty of Americans, everyday Americans, who die as a result of this.
[02:37:28.495 --> 02:37:29.515]  Whether they're in the U.S.
[02:37:29.555 --> 02:37:37.398]  military or whether they're just tourists trying to see another country, trying to acclimatize themselves to another culture.
[02:37:38.524 --> 02:37:42.287]  This, how do, and I'm trying to be very calm about this.
[02:37:42.307 --> 02:37:48.031]  Can you imagine being in Pakistan where every day a plane flies over and just blows up whoever they want illegally?
[02:37:48.211 --> 02:37:49.452]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:37:49.532 --> 02:37:53.755]  And the fact is, is that it's being done in our name, our name.
[02:37:53.935 --> 02:37:59.219]  And I call the left out about this, the so-called left, the so-called liberals, the so-called progressives.
[02:37:59.679 --> 02:38:00.379]  Where are you?
[02:38:00.879 --> 02:38:02.040]  What are you doing now?
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:03.340]  When G.W.
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:06.241]  Bush was doing this, you were out in the streets.
[02:38:06.501 --> 02:38:07.842]  Where are you now?
[02:38:08.362 --> 02:38:08.682]  Okay?
[02:38:08.962 --> 02:38:16.905]  Barack Obama, drone man, has taken this, he has extended the policies of Bush and exacerbated them.
[02:38:17.545 --> 02:38:18.805]  Let's stop being hypocrites.
[02:38:19.046 --> 02:38:19.786]  Let's be real.
[02:38:20.026 --> 02:38:22.027]  Let's come together collectively as a people.
[02:38:22.267 --> 02:38:25.948]  That's how I, that is my take on it.
[02:38:25.988 --> 02:38:28.889]  Well, I've talked to so many national security people who are even establishment
[02:38:29.409 --> 02:38:37.793]  And they're like, look, these big corporations just want new wars to sell more bombs and to get resources for other corporations, and we don't even get the booty.
[02:38:38.353 --> 02:38:40.594]  And I wouldn't be for it if we were getting the booty.
[02:38:40.614 --> 02:38:40.774]  Right.
[02:38:40.894 --> 02:38:44.416]  But we're paying, so many guys go, we need to go into Iraq to get the oil.
[02:38:44.896 --> 02:38:45.836]  Oil prices went up.
[02:38:46.176 --> 02:38:51.399]  The truth is they went in because Saddam was over pumping to pay off his debts, driving down the price.
[02:38:51.519 --> 02:38:53.960]  We went to Iraq to jack the price up.
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:55.140]  Right, right.
[02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:56.841]  It's always the opposite.
[02:38:57.061 --> 02:39:05.545]  I was just saying on a program last week, the host asked me, well, what do you think about the, how do you deal with the corporate stream media news?
[02:39:05.845 --> 02:39:08.166]  I said, this is how I deal with the corporate stream media news.
[02:39:08.587 --> 02:39:12.228]  I look at it, I reverse it, and then I move forward to find the truth.
[02:39:12.569 --> 02:39:13.369]  I decipher it.
[02:39:13.789 --> 02:39:20.254]  It's like if someone is speaking Russian or French or German or Swahili or whatever, you have to decipher the language first.
[02:39:20.514 --> 02:39:22.016]  And this is how we have to handle this.
[02:39:22.756 --> 02:39:24.497]  I call it corporate stream vomit.
[02:39:24.678 --> 02:39:25.438]  Let's be honest.
[02:39:25.678 --> 02:39:26.739]  Because that's what it is.
[02:39:27.039 --> 02:39:28.380]  It's meant to control.
[02:39:29.301 --> 02:39:29.802]  Every day.
[02:39:29.822 --> 02:39:34.846]  And look at the messages, how they're anti-family, anti-male, anti-woman, anti-child.
[02:39:35.086 --> 02:39:36.688]  I mean, this is a group of crooks.
[02:39:36.748 --> 02:39:41.292]  Yes, and they are well-trained and well-funded crooks.
[02:39:41.632 --> 02:39:42.593]  They are criminals.
[02:39:42.933 --> 02:39:45.316]  It makes the mafia look like child's play.
[02:39:45.356 --> 02:39:46.417]  It really, really does.
[02:39:47.128 --> 02:39:52.472]  Because they've all competed with each other in evil to develop the ultimate synthesis of scum.
[02:39:52.893 --> 02:39:56.256]  And it's a narrative, Alex, my brother, it's a narrative.
[02:39:56.636 --> 02:40:00.299]  It's a narrative that this corporate stream media puts out.
[02:40:00.359 --> 02:40:04.923]  I call them the propaganda arm of the government, of the corporate-owned government.
[02:40:05.183 --> 02:40:10.207]  They are this so-called news media, in quotation marks, propaganda arm.
[02:40:10.808 --> 02:40:15.612]  Why, Herman Goering, of World War II fame, would be
[02:40:16.252 --> 02:40:31.265]  Absolutely ecstatic with joy to see how so many people in this country, and throughout the world, but in this country, have been programmed and to accept that narrative, buy that narrative, forget their narrative.
[02:40:31.485 --> 02:40:32.907]  We must develop our own narrative.
[02:40:32.927 --> 02:40:37.471]  That's my next question, and we do that from history, common sense, research, not being lazy.
[02:40:37.611 --> 02:40:39.733]  Because even when you want to know the truth, it's hard to get it.
[02:40:40.333 --> 02:40:42.955]  Much less just being lazy and just accepting whatever you're told.
[02:40:43.275 --> 02:40:47.877]  Plus the world's so busy, I don't blame people, but it's at your peril that you ignore this info.
[02:40:48.458 --> 02:40:54.461]  The narrative seems to be collapsing more and more, though, for the establishment Democrats and establishment Republicans.
[02:40:55.161 --> 02:40:56.762]  And A, do you agree with that?
[02:40:56.822 --> 02:41:01.325]  And B, how do you expect them to try to then clamp back down and get control of the narrative?
[02:41:01.545 --> 02:41:02.866]  Absolutely, I agree with that.
[02:41:02.966 --> 02:41:10.653]  These Democrats, Republicans, I call them Republicrats, because they all feed from precisely the same trough, okay?
[02:41:11.013 --> 02:41:13.536]  But absolutely, I agree with that.
[02:41:13.676 --> 02:41:20.041]  Their narrative is being challenged and questioned, and therefore is being broken down.
[02:41:20.101 --> 02:41:21.663]  But we've got a lot more work to do.
[02:41:21.903 --> 02:41:22.844]  A lot more work to do.
[02:41:23.424 --> 02:41:23.824]  However,
[02:41:24.585 --> 02:41:37.192]  The monsters that we're dealing with, and yes they are monsters, I'm not, I understand that they're supposed to be human beings, but human beings can act in very monstrous ways, and that's what they do, deliberately.
[02:41:37.312 --> 02:41:39.153]  Anyway, the point is, is that
[02:41:39.993 --> 02:41:54.643]  We can expect that the corporate stream media, the corporate government, Wall Street, the whole bunch of them, their gang, I like that term because that's exactly what they are, their gang, they're going to engage in all kinds of activities.
[02:41:54.943 --> 02:42:00.046]  They're going to have false flag events occurring constantly.
[02:42:00.247 --> 02:42:00.527]  Why?
[02:42:00.607 --> 02:42:06.250]  Because that diverts people's attention, it keeps people in fear, it keeps people divided.
[02:42:06.411 --> 02:42:08.032]  Expect this, brothers and sisters.
[02:42:08.732 --> 02:42:14.996]  I had Bloomberg, two reporters, call me yesterday, doing a big investigative report, and they kept going, why do you think the government might be involved?
[02:42:15.356 --> 02:42:18.979]  And I said, well, they've been involved in hundreds of events, and they didn't want to hear real events.
[02:42:18.999 --> 02:42:19.979]  They didn't want to see facts.
[02:42:20.260 --> 02:42:34.429]  I go, if somebody's done something over and over again, and then it fits the same narrative, and then they're covering stuff up, and these guys were handled by the FBI and CIA, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then when the guy's in the hospital, they say that they've now admitted to it, and now there's a letter found in the boat.
[02:42:34.689 --> 02:42:37.531]  I mean, all, I mean, it's, and they wouldn't, and they kept saying,
[02:42:37.691 --> 02:42:41.434]  Well, we're going to say you said this, and they would say something I didn't say, and go, is that fair?
[02:42:41.494 --> 02:42:42.615]  Is that fair for an hour?
[02:42:43.076 --> 02:42:44.917]  And I said, man, I can't do this anymore with you.
[02:42:45.297 --> 02:42:46.458]  I said, this is what I said.
[02:42:47.019 --> 02:42:48.600]  And they'd go, but is it fair to say this?
[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:49.861]  And they'd say back this other thing.
[02:42:50.322 --> 02:42:50.902]  Is it fair?
[02:42:51.543 --> 02:42:54.045]  And it was just that they were there to get a fake statement.
[02:42:54.125 --> 02:42:54.305]  Right.
[02:42:54.765 --> 02:42:57.666]  And they're listening right now to put it out there to make us look stupid.
[02:42:57.886 --> 02:42:59.386]  And look, man, I don't have all the answers.
[02:42:59.666 --> 02:43:03.707]  I just know this government's run by a bunch of crooks and it's getting worse.
[02:43:04.068 --> 02:43:08.889]  And I kept telling the reporters, I go, do you really think you're safe living in a country run by a bunch of ruthless crooks?
[02:43:09.209 --> 02:43:11.069]  Do you really want to play games right now?
[02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:16.451]  And the fact is, as you were talking, as you were talking just now, Alex, I thought about the USS Liberty.
[02:43:17.091 --> 02:43:21.445]  How many people, how many people in this country are aware of the USS Liberty?
[02:43:21.465 --> 02:43:21.926]  Okay?
[02:43:21.946 --> 02:43:22.668]  Tell them about it.
[02:43:22.789 --> 02:43:24.374]  The ship that was attacked.
[02:43:25.296 --> 02:43:27.297]  Really, as a result of U.S.
[02:43:27.357 --> 02:43:30.800]  guidance by the Israelis, who were acting as proxies.
[02:43:32.221 --> 02:43:34.782]  This was a ship that had all Americans on it.
[02:43:35.043 --> 02:43:36.784]  When I say all Americans, it was a U.S.
[02:43:36.844 --> 02:43:37.444]  Navy ship!
[02:43:38.065 --> 02:43:38.405]  Okay?
[02:43:38.725 --> 02:43:39.486]  It was attacked.
[02:43:39.546 --> 02:43:41.127]  It was in international waters.
[02:43:41.467 --> 02:43:43.428]  It was attacked for over two hours!
[02:43:43.989 --> 02:43:46.530]  Many people on that vessel were killed.
[02:43:47.111 --> 02:43:47.331]  Okay?
[02:43:47.431 --> 02:43:49.552]  This was at the bidding of whom?
[02:43:49.852 --> 02:43:50.933]  Of our own government!
[02:43:51.233 --> 02:43:53.635]  And I use the word, own, in heavy quotation marks.
[02:43:54.035 --> 02:43:54.996]  Now, if they'll do that,
[02:43:55.976 --> 02:44:12.902]  And they've done so many other things, from the Pueblo incident in the late 1960s, to what occurred just a few years later with USS Liberty, to what the Central Intelligence Agency and other agencies have done in New York, in Minneapolis, in Los Angeles.
[02:44:12.922 --> 02:44:19.164]  When I say what they have done, I'm talking about the tactics that they use to control and manipulate.
[02:44:19.224 --> 02:44:24.449]  Well, they go out and find mentally ill or low IQ people, give them money for years, then give them real bombs.
[02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:27.632]  They coordinate, they lead, they hatch the plans.
[02:44:27.932 --> 02:44:35.460]  And I was quoting the New York Times to Bloomberg, going, hey, here's the New York Times admitting all the major terror plots were hatched by the FBI.
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:36.261]  Here's the headline.
[02:44:36.481 --> 02:44:37.562]  They go, we're not going to discuss that.
[02:44:37.822 --> 02:44:38.082]  Why?
[02:44:38.522 --> 02:44:38.802]  Why?
[02:44:38.863 --> 02:44:40.343]  And I was like, well then how am I supposed to?
[02:44:40.643 --> 02:44:41.784]  I'm the conspiracy theorist.
[02:44:42.004 --> 02:44:43.845]  You've got groups that have done this over and over again.
[02:44:44.145 --> 02:44:44.885]  They're dangerous.
[02:44:44.925 --> 02:44:46.706]  I don't like messing with them, but it's got to be done.
[02:44:47.647 --> 02:44:51.088]  Justice demands it, and you've got these giggling reporters on the other end.
[02:44:51.528 --> 02:44:52.889]  I'm like, hey, this isn't funny!
[02:44:53.069 --> 02:45:03.779]  Right, it's very dangerous and it's absolutely necessary that we the people understand that it's affecting our very lives and livelihoods for that matter.
[02:45:04.220 --> 02:45:10.045]  The fact is that if we don't pay attention to it, you know, I know I've heard the thing before Alex, I'm sure you have.
[02:45:10.606 --> 02:45:13.509]  Oh, Jones is a conspiracy theorist!
[02:45:13.869 --> 02:45:15.351]  Okay, you know what my answer is to that?
[02:45:16.292 --> 02:45:20.353]  You, sir, madam, are a denial theorist.
[02:45:21.193 --> 02:45:21.513]  Okay?
[02:45:21.833 --> 02:45:24.374]  We've got, and that's part of that corporate narrative.
[02:45:24.714 --> 02:45:33.236]  Just keep people denying, just keep them running around like, you know, rats in a cage, like hamsters running across that wheel, and we can control them.
[02:45:33.436 --> 02:45:35.616]  It's time for us to stop being denial theorists.
[02:45:35.876 --> 02:45:38.457]  It's time for us to be critical thinkers.
[02:45:38.797 --> 02:45:43.078]  And most of the time, it's their narrative that they're trying to put in your mouth, or my mouth,
[02:45:43.658 --> 02:45:44.599]  That's what they're trying to do.
[02:46:04.173 --> 02:46:09.176]  A lot of times they bring out scandals in the second term because the power structure doesn't want one group getting too powerful.
[02:46:09.516 --> 02:46:13.218]  But this, I think, I watched those hearings where those whistleblowers went public.
[02:46:13.238 --> 02:46:13.899]  They were scared.
[02:46:13.919 --> 02:46:15.359]  They were told to stand down.
[02:46:15.399 --> 02:46:17.100]  For some reason they wanted that ambassador dead.
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:19.121]  We now know it was to get missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:19.682 --> 02:46:25.505]  And they think we're so dumb they're going to have Al-Qaeda blow stuff up and then I guess take our liberties because they're Al-Qaeda blow stuff up.
[02:46:25.825 --> 02:46:29.007]  Do you think that's accurate or what do you think is going on?
[02:46:29.087 --> 02:46:33.630]  Well, the bitter irony when we speak of Al-Qaeda is Al-Qaeda is in fact what?
[02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:37.732]  It came into being as a result of the United States CIA.
[02:46:37.972 --> 02:46:38.352]  On record.
[02:46:38.592 --> 02:46:39.493]  It's right on record.
[02:46:39.533 --> 02:46:41.094]  This is on congressional record.
[02:46:41.514 --> 02:46:43.155]  It is all over the place.
[02:46:43.375 --> 02:46:46.156]  But how many people are cognizant of that?
[02:46:46.336 --> 02:46:50.219]  How many people know that the quote-unquote terrorists
[02:46:51.007 --> 02:46:56.593]  We're groomed by none other than our so-called government, okay?
[02:46:57.033 --> 02:47:00.277]  And we are the victims, as well as people all over the world.
[02:47:00.297 --> 02:47:02.379]  And that's not even our theory.
[02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:07.064]  We know they were, and protected, and so why do I get my rights taken?
[02:47:07.124 --> 02:47:07.324]  Right.
[02:47:07.385 --> 02:47:08.626]  I mean, this is the oldest trick in the book.
[02:47:08.806 --> 02:47:09.386]  Right, right.
[02:47:09.426 --> 02:47:16.349]  And as I said, Herman Goering and others in the Third Reich, and people go, ah, don't bring up the Nazis, don't bring up the Nazis.
[02:47:16.429 --> 02:47:18.910]  Okay, let's bring up Benito Mussolini.
[02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:19.831]  He did the same thing.
[02:47:19.851 --> 02:47:20.291]  Soviets.
[02:47:20.611 --> 02:47:26.874]  Yes, and for that matter, let's bring up the U.S.-backed dictator Francisco Franco.
[02:47:27.054 --> 02:47:28.455]  He did the same thing in Spain.
[02:47:28.495 --> 02:47:29.315]  He did false flags.
[02:47:29.335 --> 02:47:30.456]  Yes, all the time.
[02:47:30.696 --> 02:47:31.216]  All the time.
[02:47:31.456 --> 02:47:35.758]  So this is not an ideological thing, this is a people's real thing, and we better
[02:47:36.198 --> 02:47:37.139]  We better pay attention.
[02:47:37.159 --> 02:47:42.484]  Well, yeah, because even if real terrorists attack us, we gut up, we deal with it, we don't give our rights up because of it.
[02:47:42.704 --> 02:47:48.590]  But when they blow something up and go, day one, give your rights up, 9-11, you'll never have rights again, it's the end of freedom in America.
[02:47:49.210 --> 02:47:53.655]  Well, even if they didn't do it, which the shows they did, you're trying to take my rights using a tragedy.
[02:47:54.455 --> 02:47:57.538]  You don't negotiate with terrorists, you don't give up your rights because of it.
[02:47:57.799 --> 02:48:00.301]  I mean, right there, there's no doubt that's what's going on.
[02:48:00.581 --> 02:48:01.221]  Absolutely.
[02:48:01.282 --> 02:48:02.242]  There is no doubt.
[02:48:02.522 --> 02:48:11.047]  I mean, you know, if we give up our rights, then we have no right to freedom, to justice, to liberty, to any of those things.
[02:48:11.067 --> 02:48:13.069]  Why do you think these scandals are coming out now then?
[02:48:13.309 --> 02:48:17.812]  I think that thanks to what you are doing and others like yourself,
[02:48:19.152 --> 02:48:29.177]  I think that more and more the corporate stream media and the corporate controlled government are finding themselves in a situation where they're being questioned and challenged.
[02:48:29.237 --> 02:48:32.538]  And I think we need to intensify that questioning and challenging.
[02:48:32.759 --> 02:48:34.239]  In fact, that's what they've been bemoaning.
[02:48:34.259 --> 02:48:34.780]  I think you're right.
[02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:38.041]  They've been saying there's all this new media and groups that we don't control.
[02:48:40.282 --> 02:48:43.205]  People are pointing out that we said something different a week ago than we're saying now.
[02:48:43.265 --> 02:48:43.845]  Right, right.
[02:48:43.965 --> 02:48:44.566]  Absolutely.
[02:48:44.646 --> 02:48:48.129]  And I smile, not because it's funny, but it's so ludicrous.
[02:48:48.409 --> 02:48:49.510]  It is pathetic.
[02:48:50.031 --> 02:48:57.137]  And I always say to sisters and brothers, brothers and sisters, let's keep some levity in this.
[02:48:57.257 --> 02:48:59.900]  Because if we don't have some levity, we'll go insane.
[02:49:00.220 --> 02:49:00.560]  I agree.
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:01.901]  And we're not going to go insane.
[02:49:01.921 --> 02:49:03.483]  We're going to keep some levity in this.
[02:49:03.763 --> 02:49:04.704]  And so I smile.
[02:49:05.104 --> 02:49:10.909]  And the more we look at what the tactics are of these people, they really haven't changed.
[02:49:11.329 --> 02:49:14.171]  They really haven't changed from the 60s to the 70s to the 80s.
[02:49:14.191 --> 02:49:14.972]  No, they don't change.
[02:49:14.992 --> 02:49:15.892]  It's funny.
[02:49:17.734 --> 02:49:19.195]  Are like obsessive compulsive.
[02:49:19.215 --> 02:49:20.737]  They do the same thing the exact same way.
[02:49:20.797 --> 02:49:20.977]  Right.
[02:49:21.117 --> 02:49:21.818]  Here's an example.
[02:49:21.878 --> 02:49:27.543]  A lot of cops are actually waking up and I don't want to play part of that balkanization, demonizing them because that's what they want us to be, us against them.
[02:49:27.583 --> 02:49:31.227]  But they're trying to make police more and more corrupt, more and more authoritarian.
[02:49:32.643 --> 02:49:35.445]  And when a cop's all over the country, I'll walk up and say, why are you videotaping?
[02:49:35.465 --> 02:49:36.286]  And I'll be on the street corner.
[02:49:36.306 --> 02:49:37.387]  I go, well, you're 100 yards away.
[02:49:37.407 --> 02:49:38.187]  Am I interfering with you?
[02:49:38.227 --> 02:49:39.688]  Well, no, but I want your name and stuff.
[02:49:39.708 --> 02:49:41.270]  And I go, well, I want your name and stuff.
[02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:42.470]  And then I'll just laugh.
[02:49:42.510 --> 02:49:44.172]  And I'll go, come on, man, this isn't North Korea.
[02:49:44.632 --> 02:49:49.376]  And I've noticed then they'll start laughing too, realizing they've been told to do this, but it's so stupid.
[02:49:49.616 --> 02:49:50.536]  If you act afraid,
[02:49:51.357 --> 02:49:55.078]  Then they like alert and take you to jail, but if you laugh and go, man, knock it off!
[02:49:55.298 --> 02:49:55.498]  Yeah.
[02:49:55.598 --> 02:49:57.018]  Stop, you know, this is ridiculous.
[02:49:57.038 --> 02:49:59.819]  Then they kind of click and go, yeah, this is ridiculous.
[02:49:59.839 --> 02:50:03.400]  You know, like cops were saying we couldn't hand out our magazines in downtown Austin.
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:05.140]  And I called them up, got the cops on the phone.
[02:50:05.321 --> 02:50:08.661]  My guys were down there and I, and I go, why are you doing this to America?
[02:50:08.681 --> 02:50:10.102]  Why are you doing this to your family?
[02:50:10.122 --> 02:50:10.942]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[02:50:10.962 --> 02:50:11.902]  I'm like, yeah, I know.
[02:50:11.922 --> 02:50:12.662]  I listen to your show.
[02:50:12.682 --> 02:50:13.583]  I've been told to do this.
[02:50:14.103 --> 02:50:15.843]  And we go out and give that ticket and I'm going to sue you.
[02:50:16.523 --> 02:50:18.764]  And so then they back off, but they already given some tickets.
[02:50:19.244 --> 02:50:21.646]  And then I go down there and the cops are all, hey, let's pose with a photo.
[02:50:21.686 --> 02:50:22.607]  You're right, we don't like it.
[02:50:22.908 --> 02:50:24.169]  We're glad you stood up to us.
[02:50:24.469 --> 02:50:25.730]  We don't like to follow these orders.
[02:50:25.990 --> 02:50:27.632]  Well, you should say no up front.
[02:50:27.752 --> 02:50:27.952]  Right.
[02:50:28.052 --> 02:50:35.379]  You should say no, like I did, instead of just... I mean, in America, we can't hand out magazines during Stop by Southwest anywhere downtown.
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:37.221]  I mean, what's wrong with you?
[02:50:37.421 --> 02:50:37.982]  Right, right.
[02:50:38.042 --> 02:50:46.149]  And the fact is, is that, you know, all people, whether they call themselves police officers, whether they call themselves military, I don't give a zip what they call themselves.
[02:50:46.169 --> 02:50:50.333]  The fact of the matter is, is that we better begin from a standpoint of our humanity and our freedom.
[02:50:50.754 --> 02:50:53.336]  We better begin there and end there and keep it there.
[02:50:53.797 --> 02:50:55.178]  So, uh... I agree with you.
[02:50:55.198 --> 02:50:55.819]  We gotta go to break.
[02:50:56.119 --> 02:50:59.582]  Larry Pinckney's Art Gas will give you his website on the other side as well.
[02:50:59.622 --> 02:51:00.023]  Stay with us.

[02:52:01.207 --> 02:52:03.129]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:52:03.149 --> 02:52:05.391]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:52:05.551 --> 02:52:10.776]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:52:10.977 --> 02:52:14.740]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:52:15.001 --> 02:52:18.744]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:52:18.904 --> 02:52:20.085]  The fact is, you are.
[02:52:20.286 --> 02:52:21.066]  We all are.
[02:52:21.307 --> 02:52:23.629]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[02:52:50.242 --> 02:52:53.364]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:52:53.384 --> 02:52:55.365]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:52:55.405 --> 02:53:02.028]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.521 --> 02:53:22.462]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:23.082 --> 02:53:34.044]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:34.444 --> 02:53:41.446]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:42.126 --> 02:53:46.407]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:46.427 --> 02:53:49.608]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[02:54:33.355 --> 02:54:36.017]  We've got a wide spectrum of ideas on that site.
[02:54:36.037 --> 02:54:37.158]  We're going to do Overdrive.
[02:54:37.198 --> 02:54:43.804]  Some stations carry it, but if you don't, it'll be on the podcast or the free audio streams at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:54:44.064 --> 02:54:51.290]  Go to infowars.com forward slash show, or infowars.com forward slash listen to find all the free links, free podcasts, free iPhone apps, you name it.
[02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:59.432]  I have done two hours and 54 minutes so far, and I have not plugged any of the water filters we sell, which is a win-win.
[02:54:59.472 --> 02:55:03.673]  Stop drinking all their poison, the cancer exploding, the Harvard study on the fluoride, all of it.
[02:55:04.634 --> 02:55:08.935]  We sell stuff that funds us that we feel is incredibly moral at the lowest price out there.
[02:55:09.215 --> 02:55:13.558]  Promo code WATER, get 10% off at infowarstore.com.

[02:55:29.008 --> 02:55:31.850]  And we went out on the streets of Austin because it was such a demand.
[02:55:32.591 --> 02:55:35.553]  We put $80,000 on the streets of Central Texas, or actually more than that.
[02:55:36.053 --> 02:55:37.874]  We were able to pull another $1,000 or so.
[02:55:39.495 --> 02:55:42.238]  Uh, that aren't damaged, and they're basically gone everywhere else now.
[02:55:42.658 --> 02:55:46.062]  We went out and re-pulled them off, you know, where we put them free for people in Central Texas.
[02:55:46.362 --> 02:55:49.465]  You can buy them right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:55:49.485 --> 02:55:51.467]  InfowarsStore.com.
[02:55:51.507 --> 02:55:54.310]  You can, we held some back too for people that get a 12-month subscription.
[02:55:54.690 --> 02:55:56.032]  They also are a great gift to give.
[02:55:56.112 --> 02:56:00.456]  Big, color, glossy, uh, old-fashioned, you know, size, like the old Rolling Stone.
[02:56:01.317 --> 02:56:01.979]  I don't think so.
[02:56:12.947 --> 02:56:14.628]  When they're gone, they're gone.
[02:56:14.648 --> 02:56:17.070]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:19.592]  Now, Larry Pinckney, I've asked a bunch of questions here.
[02:56:19.612 --> 02:56:21.233]  We're going to go into overdrive in the next hour.
[02:56:22.233 --> 02:56:23.715]  And, you know, I've thrown out some stuff here.
[02:56:24.775 --> 02:56:26.356]  But what do you want to get into?
[02:56:27.197 --> 02:56:30.119]  Because obviously we can talk about a lot of stuff, but what do you want to get into?
[02:56:30.239 --> 02:56:33.822]  Well, I want to get into... I want to remind people.
[02:56:34.878 --> 02:56:35.339]  All of us.
[02:56:35.659 --> 02:56:38.942]  That we are the ones who ultimately have the power.
[02:56:39.642 --> 02:56:41.344]  We have to recognize this.
[02:56:41.924 --> 02:56:45.908]  It's one thing, and it's extremely important, to warn people.
[02:56:45.948 --> 02:56:51.993]  That's why the system tells us we don't have power and flies around in big jets and red carpets and big giant buildings is to make us feel small.
[02:56:52.073 --> 02:56:52.814]  Right, right.
[02:56:52.914 --> 02:56:54.655]  And if we feel small, we feel powerless.
[02:56:54.755 --> 02:56:55.316]  We are not!
[02:56:58.078 --> 02:56:59.519]  Powerless, okay?
[02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:04.944]  I think that we need to understand, and some of the things... That's the key, that's what scares them.
[02:57:05.164 --> 02:57:05.364]  Yes.
[02:57:05.384 --> 02:57:06.625]  So we're going to get into that in detail?
[02:57:06.765 --> 02:57:06.945]  Yes.
[02:57:06.985 --> 02:57:07.926]  We're just telling people what's coming up.
[02:57:07.966 --> 02:57:08.727]  What else do you want to get into?
[02:57:08.967 --> 02:57:10.488]  Well, I'll follow your lead.
[02:57:10.829 --> 02:57:12.510]  No man, I want to see what you wildcarded.
[02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:12.750]  Okay.
[02:57:12.770 --> 02:57:13.611]  What else do you want to get into?
[02:57:13.691 --> 02:57:18.195]  Okay, what I would like to get into is I would also like to talk a bit
[02:57:18.835 --> 02:57:23.878]  About some possibilities of what we can be doing out there.
[02:57:23.898 --> 02:57:25.378]  I want to be very positive.
[02:57:25.679 --> 02:57:28.180]  Talk about solutions.
[02:57:28.300 --> 02:57:31.702]  I think it begins with the seed of the universe like Gandhi said is in all of us.
[02:57:32.422 --> 02:57:34.563]  And the Bible says we're made in the image of the Creator.
[02:57:34.783 --> 02:57:36.764]  That's pretty heavy stuff.
[02:57:36.984 --> 02:57:37.965]  Humans we create.
[02:57:38.665 --> 02:57:38.965]  And again,
[02:57:40.206 --> 02:57:45.715]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, if you look in the eyes of a child, I don't care what color they are, you see the soul.
[02:57:46.176 --> 02:57:47.658]  It's the same thing, a beautiful soul.
[02:57:48.099 --> 02:57:53.728]  And it tears my guts out to see the persecution of the innocent, and the persecution, the eugenics of the globalists.
[02:57:54.597 --> 02:58:02.340]  And I want the globalists to know, and I think they know this, you're never going to inherit all the great things that humanity's going to have if you try to take it from other people.
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:05.181]  The only way you're going to get anything is to try to give it to everybody else.
[02:58:05.421 --> 02:58:10.002]  That doesn't mean buy into the fake counterfeit of, well, they give everything you've got to the government to distribute it.
[02:58:10.203 --> 02:58:11.343]  That's the lie of control.
[02:58:11.703 --> 02:58:14.804]  I'm talking about if you don't want justice and goodwill.
[02:58:15.064 --> 02:58:16.205]  People ask, what do you stand for?
[02:58:16.245 --> 02:58:16.645]  Goodwill.
[02:58:17.325 --> 02:58:18.365]  I start with goodwill.
[02:58:19.046 --> 02:58:23.047]  If I find out you're evil and you want to destroy me, make me your slave, I'm mean, man.
[02:58:23.367 --> 02:58:25.587]  I'm aggressive, but God gave me all of that.
[02:58:26.108 --> 02:58:28.888]  I can think more evil than the evil guys, but I'm not going to use the evil.
[02:58:29.188 --> 02:58:31.569]  I can get in your shoes, though, to know what your next move is.
[02:58:32.129 --> 02:58:38.231]  And that's what you've got to do, is tune in to the discernment God's given us all, and we can save humanity and go to the stars.
[02:58:38.771 --> 02:58:39.952]  Stay with us, we're coming right back.

[02:59:52.036 --> 02:59:53.198]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.579 --> 02:59:54.841]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.861 --> 02:59:58.847]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.885 --> 03:00:10.068]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.728 --> 03:00:11.529]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.309 --> 03:00:13.190]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.850 --> 03:00:17.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.053 --> 03:00:22.115]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:27.605 --> 03:00:32.908]  All right, folks, we're in overdrive with Larry Pinckney, black activist, WG.org.
[03:00:33.048 --> 03:00:36.070]  All right, you were getting into the power of humanity.
[03:00:36.090 --> 03:00:40.333]  Let's spend five minutes on that and then come back, the final segment with you live here, getting into solutions.
[03:00:40.373 --> 03:00:40.933]  Larry Pinckney.
[03:00:41.274 --> 03:00:44.576]  I want to say that I think that all of us, all of us,
[03:00:45.436 --> 03:01:05.662]  Uh, men, women, children, black, white, brown, red, yellow, all of us need to understand that if we're going to bring about change, to change things for ourselves individually as well as everyone collectively, that means we have to understand that the power rests with us, not with the government, not with corporations, but with us.
[03:01:05.902 --> 03:01:07.643]  We have to begin to communicate
[03:01:08.283 --> 03:01:08.923]  With each other.
[03:01:09.123 --> 03:01:11.864]  Does that mean we're going to agree 100% of the time?
[03:01:12.244 --> 03:01:13.105]  Absolutely not!
[03:01:13.165 --> 03:01:14.305]  We don't want robots!
[03:01:14.945 --> 03:01:17.766]  We want thinking, feeling human beings.
[03:01:18.127 --> 03:01:20.267]  And I think that's very important.
[03:01:20.347 --> 03:01:24.469]  Anybody who's in agreement with someone 100% of the time, somebody's lying.
[03:01:24.889 --> 03:01:25.849]  And we don't want liars.
[03:01:26.209 --> 03:01:29.711]  We want thinking, critically thinking, acting, doing people.
[03:01:30.131 --> 03:01:36.353]  So ultimately, Alex, I feel, ultimately, that I see good things in the future.
[03:01:36.573 --> 03:01:37.113]  I really do.
[03:01:37.353 --> 03:01:38.594]  I see good things happening.
[03:01:38.614 --> 03:01:45.338]  When I say good things, I mean people are waking up from being in a state of sheeple, if you will.
[03:01:45.638 --> 03:01:50.141]  They're waking up to understand that we're the ones who can change our lot.
[03:01:50.861 --> 03:01:51.181]  Okay?
[03:01:51.582 --> 03:01:58.846]  And to me, that's extremely important because, you know, I've heard people say, well, you guys do, you just talk about all the bad things.
[03:01:59.625 --> 03:02:10.512]  Well, we don't just talk about the bad things, we identify those... Well, the world is so beautiful and good, it's because I love all the beauty and the good stuff, that the evil that's growing makes me mad.
[03:02:10.572 --> 03:02:10.732]  Right.
[03:02:10.912 --> 03:02:15.836]  It's like if you have a forest fire out back your house, hey, don't talk about the fire, come in and have a beer!
[03:02:16.036 --> 03:02:18.197]  What's gonna burn our house down if we don't put the fire out?
[03:02:18.317 --> 03:02:19.378]  Exactly, good point.
[03:02:19.458 --> 03:02:27.684]  I actually use that example myself when people criticize me for being on certain programs, including this one, and I ask them,
[03:02:28.764 --> 03:02:31.506]  What do you think about the substance of what the program was about?
[03:02:31.806 --> 03:02:32.627]  Oh, that was good!
[03:02:33.287 --> 03:02:39.091]  I said, well, if something does not compute, if that was good, the substance of what the program was about, what is your problem?
[03:02:39.711 --> 03:02:42.173]  They said, well, it's just that it's that program.
[03:02:42.393 --> 03:02:44.995]  Well, I think they don't want the criticism by trolls.
[03:02:46.769 --> 03:02:52.232]  They misjudge the trolls attacking means you're doing good work and there's nothing to be afraid of.
[03:02:52.432 --> 03:02:52.652]  Right.
[03:02:52.932 --> 03:02:55.293]  But if you're not being criticized, no one's looking at you.
[03:02:55.813 --> 03:02:58.394]  I mean, when you get big groups of people looking at you, you're going to get attacked.
[03:02:58.475 --> 03:02:59.015]  Right, right.
[03:02:59.035 --> 03:02:59.875]  That just goes with it.
[03:03:00.075 --> 03:03:02.316]  And you know, that's what Brother Malcolm X said, too.
[03:03:02.476 --> 03:03:05.098]  He said it in almost exactly the same words.
[03:03:05.338 --> 03:03:09.480]  If you're not doing something for the people, you're not going to get attacked.
[03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:11.621]  But if you are, if you're serving the people,
[03:03:12.381 --> 03:03:14.162]  Rest assured, you're gonna be attacked.
[03:03:14.442 --> 03:03:17.363]  So, we gotta look at it from that positive.
[03:03:17.383 --> 03:03:21.924]  Sure, that's what I'm saying, is that I don't have all the answers.
[03:03:21.984 --> 03:03:27.606]  I hear stuff I say six months later, don't totally agree with it, because it's whatever mindset you're in, or how you're saying it.
[03:03:27.786 --> 03:03:29.147]  You're like, oh, I wish I would have said it this way.
[03:03:29.507 --> 03:03:30.927]  But, look, I'm not gonna overthink it.
[03:03:31.228 --> 03:03:34.409]  They want us to all overthink it while they screw us, consciously.
[03:03:34.929 --> 03:03:36.569]  I'm just trying to get people out of their coma.
[03:03:36.809 --> 03:03:38.050]  You don't have to agree with me.
[03:03:38.310 --> 03:03:39.070]  Wake up, man!
[03:03:39.090 --> 03:03:39.830]  Stuff isn't good!
[03:03:41.491 --> 03:03:43.812]  Get him out of that comatose state, you know.
[03:03:44.172 --> 03:03:46.513]  Again, I hearken back to Brother Malcolm.
[03:03:46.533 --> 03:03:52.056]  Malcolm talks about how, you know, you go to the dentist's office and the dentist shoots you up with Novocaine.
[03:03:52.556 --> 03:03:55.618]  Meanwhile, you're bleeding all over the place, but you don't feel it.
[03:03:55.718 --> 03:03:56.438]  You don't see it.
[03:03:56.598 --> 03:03:58.399]  Because they've shot you up with Novocaine.
[03:03:58.419 --> 03:03:59.899]  That's a good analogy, I didn't know he does.
[03:03:59.939 --> 03:04:00.139]  Perfect.
[03:04:00.159 --> 03:04:01.219]  Yeah, that was Malcolm's analogy.
[03:04:01.259 --> 03:04:02.420]  We're deadened, yeah, yeah.
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:02.920]  Exactly.
[03:04:03.900 --> 03:04:07.842]  And then I say get rid of the deadening, or you say it, and you're causing pain.
[03:04:08.142 --> 03:04:10.442]  No, I'm getting the deadening away so you know what's going on.
[03:04:10.502 --> 03:04:12.723]  Exactly, and therefore do something about it.
[03:04:13.363 --> 03:04:15.684]  You know, it's like the analogy you used about the house.
[03:04:16.044 --> 03:04:19.405]  If the house is on fire and the neighbor says, well forget that, come, let's have a beer.
[03:04:19.565 --> 03:04:20.926]  Well, I like beer, but come on!
[03:04:21.226 --> 03:04:23.326]  The house is on fire, for crying out loud.
[03:04:23.566 --> 03:04:24.847]  That's a great analogy yourself.
[03:04:25.404 --> 03:04:30.046]  Well, I mean, I liken it to banging on somebody's door and going, hey, your house is on fire, and they go, don't be so negative.
[03:04:30.166 --> 03:04:33.087]  And I'm like, I mean, it's like, you know.
[03:04:33.207 --> 03:04:34.087]  That's very good.
[03:04:34.247 --> 03:04:34.727]  I'm sorry.
[03:04:34.787 --> 03:04:35.007]  That is.
[03:04:35.027 --> 03:04:38.729]  I mean, they started setting up police checkpoints on the highway, searching everybody like 15 years ago.
[03:04:39.149 --> 03:04:39.669]  People sued.
[03:04:39.709 --> 03:04:40.329]  They got upset.
[03:04:40.689 --> 03:04:41.390]  They ruled against it.
[03:04:41.410 --> 03:04:41.830]  They quit it.
[03:04:41.950 --> 03:04:42.830]  Now they're back.
[03:04:42.850 --> 03:04:44.331]  It's like, don't be anti-police.
[03:04:44.371 --> 03:04:45.271]  I'm not anti-police.
[03:04:45.811 --> 03:04:45.991]  Right.
[03:04:46.292 --> 03:04:48.794]  A country that has checkpoints is North Korea or Mexico.
[03:04:48.854 --> 03:04:57.801]  And I've been to Mexico and you're driving to go see the pyramids and the military pulls over the bus and shakes the driver down and the driver gets on and is crying because they just robbed his wallet.
[03:04:58.562 --> 03:04:59.983]  You know, I don't want to live like that.
[03:05:00.003 --> 03:05:00.644]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.516 --> 03:05:02.677]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.937 --> 03:05:13.384]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.604 --> 03:05:17.747]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:18.067 --> 03:05:20.529]  But we can't do that without your help.

[03:05:32.076 --> 03:05:35.337]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.577 --> 03:05:41.238]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.698 --> 03:05:51.179]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.599 --> 03:05:52.780]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.100 --> 03:05:54.520]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.680]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.323 --> 03:06:03.526]  What's safer and cheaper than prescription drugs?
[03:06:04.006 --> 03:06:04.787]  Glad you asked.
[03:06:05.248 --> 03:06:07.310]  The answer is renovation teas.
[03:06:07.610 --> 03:06:11.535]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.
[03:06:11.815 --> 03:06:15.860]  Tastes great and most importantly herbal teas are effective and non-addictive.
[03:06:16.100 --> 03:06:18.964]  Renovation tea is especially unique and here's why.
[03:06:19.304 --> 03:06:22.605]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.

[03:08:01.753 --> 03:08:03.955]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.516 --> 03:08:07.299]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:15.458 --> 03:08:17.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[03:08:17.800 --> 03:08:18.940]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:08:19.321 --> 03:08:29.187]  Larry Pinckney, the Information Minister at one point for the Black Panther Party, Minister of the Interior, just a really interesting political mind.
[03:08:29.207 --> 03:08:32.329]  He was getting into the power of the people and that we have the power.
[03:08:32.349 --> 03:08:35.311]  We were talking about getting people out of their commas and other solutions.
[03:08:35.351 --> 03:08:37.953]  In this 12 minutes, you've got the floor, my friend.
[03:08:38.213 --> 03:08:42.076]  Breakdown solutions, ideas for people out there.
[03:08:42.216 --> 03:08:42.737]  Right, right.
[03:08:42.797 --> 03:08:52.047]  And let me just say that, just historically, I want to be very correct about this, I was Minister of Interior for the Republic of New Africa, RNA as we called it.
[03:08:52.147 --> 03:08:53.168]  I can't keep track of it all.
[03:08:53.188 --> 03:08:54.290]  Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:56.752]  I was in it and I still have it all for me.
[03:08:57.153 --> 03:09:01.317]  Alright, I was a section leader in the Black Panther Party, I'm a veteran of the party, etc, etc.
[03:09:01.397 --> 03:09:02.459]  Anyway, the point is this.
[03:09:03.942 --> 03:09:10.425]  The people in this country, the people in this country have to be creative.
[03:09:10.825 --> 03:09:12.766]  We have to come up with our solutions.
[03:09:12.806 --> 03:09:23.412]  You remember in the first segment we were talking about Malcolm's analogy about the Novocain being shot in people's gums, making us numb so we don't see or feel our pain.
[03:09:24.312 --> 03:09:28.133]  What we need to do after we get that novocaine out, and what do I mean by that?
[03:09:28.473 --> 03:09:37.355]  I mean after we stop being couch potatoes, after we stop being disillusioned, after we stop being divided, and begin to understand.
[03:09:37.375 --> 03:09:40.836]  Start taking it personal, the globalists are screwing us, instead of fighting with each other.
[03:09:40.856 --> 03:09:41.957]  That's right, that's right.
[03:09:42.037 --> 03:09:43.177]  That's point one.
[03:09:43.837 --> 03:09:44.437]  And you know what?
[03:09:44.698 --> 03:09:45.898]  We can do that in a heartbeat.
[03:09:46.438 --> 03:09:47.879]  Individually and collectively.
[03:09:48.099 --> 03:09:49.340]  We can do that in a heartbeat.
[03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:50.160]  Is it easy?
[03:09:50.601 --> 03:09:51.661]  It's easier than you think.
[03:09:51.881 --> 03:09:55.763]  If somebody tries to push you around and rob your rights, you need to take it personal.
[03:09:55.783 --> 03:10:00.866]  They're trying to rob you of your most precious possession that a lot of people have fought and died for.
[03:10:01.086 --> 03:10:01.687]  Right, right.
[03:10:01.967 --> 03:10:05.789]  And one of the things I have learned, and I'm still learning, I'm always learning,
[03:10:06.149 --> 03:10:21.910]  But one of the things that I have learned, especially in the last, I'd say, three to four years, despite all of my political background and organizing and blah blah blah, I've learned that it is important for me to reach out to other people, especially those people
[03:10:22.895 --> 03:10:23.716]  You don't think like me.
[03:10:23.876 --> 03:10:25.157]  Oh no, they want to keep us in boxes.
[03:10:25.258 --> 03:10:26.038]  Right, right.
[03:10:26.439 --> 03:10:32.405]  Okay, and I've learned that it's important for me to listen to that perspective.
[03:10:32.806 --> 03:10:37.131]  Because if I listen closely enough, I find out that there's a kernel in there that I agree with.
[03:10:37.975 --> 03:10:44.238]  I may not understand everything that someone is saying, but I can get where they're coming from.
[03:10:44.538 --> 03:10:46.619]  I can understand their pain because I feel that.
[03:10:46.639 --> 03:10:47.539]  And that's enlightening.
[03:10:47.959 --> 03:10:50.260]  Yes, yes, and empowering.
[03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:54.742]  I hate that word because it's so overused and misunderstood.
[03:10:55.002 --> 03:10:58.263]  But in the real sense of empowerment, that's empowering.
[03:10:58.803 --> 03:11:02.405]  Because when I, and I'm talking about from personal experience,
[03:11:02.645 --> 03:11:14.233]  You know, Alex, three, four years ago, if someone had said to me, you know, you're going to be speaking with Alex Jones, I'd have looked at them, I'd have said, hmm, really?
[03:11:14.993 --> 03:11:23.339]  But the more I began to pay attention to InfoWars, and it is a war on for our minds, it is, I looked at that,
[03:11:24.215 --> 03:11:25.496]  I said, my God!
[03:11:26.196 --> 03:11:27.377]  That is correct!
[03:11:27.537 --> 03:11:29.137]  It's a war on for our minds.
[03:11:29.177 --> 03:11:34.540]  And when we understand this, we understand that we've got to do something about it.
[03:11:34.660 --> 03:11:38.162]  It's one thing to say, okay, it's a war on for our minds, but that's what you're doing.
[03:11:38.182 --> 03:11:39.242]  That's what InfoWars is doing.
[03:11:39.282 --> 03:11:42.564]  That's what the entire crew here at InfoWars is doing.
[03:11:42.864 --> 03:11:43.464]  Putting it out.
[03:11:43.644 --> 03:11:44.485]  Food for thought.
[03:11:44.545 --> 03:11:45.845]  Everyone's heard that expression.
[03:11:46.185 --> 03:11:47.066]  Food for thought.
[03:11:47.686 --> 03:11:48.686]  So, solutions.
[03:11:48.787 --> 03:11:49.487]  Solutions.
[03:11:50.745 --> 03:11:53.450]  The solutions will not come from the top.
[03:11:54.092 --> 03:11:55.695]  They will come from the bottom.
[03:11:55.855 --> 03:11:58.801]  They will come from us if we visualize a pyramid.
[03:11:59.625 --> 03:12:00.866]  What holds up that pyramid?
[03:12:00.886 --> 03:12:04.988]  That's why the system is obsessed with anything that's really grassroots and tries to take it over.
[03:12:05.008 --> 03:12:05.488]  That's right.
[03:12:05.548 --> 03:12:06.709]  Because the power is really there.
[03:12:06.849 --> 03:12:07.369]  That's right.
[03:12:07.449 --> 03:12:08.089]  And they know it.
[03:12:08.610 --> 03:12:08.850]  Alright?
[03:12:08.910 --> 03:12:10.351]  The system knows it.
[03:12:10.911 --> 03:12:12.732]  The point is, it's time for us.
[03:12:13.172 --> 03:12:16.654]  That's why they're so scared of citizens with cameras and want to intimidate us.
[03:12:17.274 --> 03:12:18.775]  And by the way, it doesn't matter.
[03:12:19.035 --> 03:12:19.615]  And you're so right.
[03:12:19.656 --> 03:12:21.056]  I'm so glad you mentioned that, Alex.
[03:12:21.316 --> 03:12:21.937]  You're so right.
[03:12:22.824 --> 03:12:25.865]  It doesn't matter what their ideology is.
[03:12:26.405 --> 03:12:28.725]  I'm talking about these citizens with the cameras.
[03:12:28.985 --> 03:12:29.565]  They don't care.
[03:12:29.585 --> 03:12:33.006]  Right-wing, left-wing, liberal, whatever they call themselves.
[03:12:33.026 --> 03:12:34.806]  If you've got a camera, they're threatened.
[03:12:35.386 --> 03:12:39.027]  And they're not threatened by a big news truck ever, because they know that's on a leash.
[03:12:39.307 --> 03:12:40.547]  Yeah, they control that.
[03:12:40.907 --> 03:12:43.568]  ABC, NBC, Fox, PBS.
[03:12:43.808 --> 03:12:44.728]  Hey, who cares?
[03:12:44.808 --> 03:12:50.009]  Rob Dewey got arrested on a hilltop in Pittsburgh with the media, showing them attacking peaceful demonstrators after the G20.
[03:12:51.129 --> 03:12:54.471]  And they came up the hill and got everybody that was mainstream media and said, you can go.
[03:12:54.491 --> 03:12:57.112]  And they arrested Dew and roughed him up.
[03:12:57.432 --> 03:12:58.492]  He won a lawsuit against him.
[03:12:58.873 --> 03:13:00.153]  But you're like, oh, you're with InfoWars?
[03:13:00.173 --> 03:13:01.214]  You're going to jail, buddy.
[03:13:02.114 --> 03:13:02.754]  And you know what?
[03:13:03.134 --> 03:13:08.077]  That says that InfoWars is doing something right in a big way.
[03:13:08.537 --> 03:13:09.978]  Right, correct, human.
[03:13:10.518 --> 03:13:13.319]  That's what I mean when I say the people struggle.
[03:13:13.879 --> 03:13:14.920]  I say keep it up.
[03:13:15.720 --> 03:13:16.782]  Kudos to Rob.
[03:13:16.982 --> 03:13:18.264]  Well it shows the sides though.
[03:13:18.284 --> 03:13:19.566]  It shows that they knew.
[03:13:20.007 --> 03:13:21.209]  Mainstream media's with us.
[03:13:21.509 --> 03:13:21.730]  Right.
[03:13:22.331 --> 03:13:25.315]  He's there with another expensive camera up on a hill just like they were.
[03:13:25.736 --> 03:13:26.557]  You're going to jail.
[03:13:26.577 --> 03:13:27.438]  We got the video.
[03:13:27.458 --> 03:13:28.760]  They go, get on your knees!
[03:13:30.003 --> 03:13:32.864]  In America, and G20's over for half a day.
[03:13:33.324 --> 03:13:36.506]  They just wanted to go attack some college kids that were out in the park.
[03:13:36.526 --> 03:13:37.326]  Of course, of course.
[03:13:38.027 --> 03:13:41.128]  And of course, the narrative is always reversed, isn't it?
[03:13:41.208 --> 03:13:41.688]  Think about it.
[03:13:41.948 --> 03:13:55.694]  It's the college kids, it's sort of like, and I'm not saying this to all cops, but I've personally experienced, and I know many, many people of all colors have experienced, it's like when some cops beat you up, then you end up charged with assault.
[03:13:55.754 --> 03:13:56.735]  Oh, it's on video all the time.
[03:13:57.535 --> 03:14:03.763]  I mean, it's not funny, but a sense of humor, so... Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's like, man, you're gonna beat me up, that's one thing, but then you're gonna bear false witness?
[03:14:03.803 --> 03:14:06.226]  Right, you're gonna charge me with beating myself up?
[03:14:06.887 --> 03:14:08.509]  It's like, wow, that's deep!
[03:14:09.050 --> 03:14:12.074]  You know, but, but... And they'll still do it when there's footage of it!
[03:14:12.094 --> 03:14:12.374]  Yes!
[03:14:12.975 --> 03:14:13.295]  Yes!
[03:14:13.636 --> 03:14:19.460]  And the jury will go, well, you did raise your arm after he'd already hit you five times, that's assault to block the blow.
[03:14:19.540 --> 03:14:19.761]  Yes.
[03:14:19.821 --> 03:14:24.785]  Have you seen the new things where people are convicted where the cop's fist hits you, so his fist gets hurt and that's assaulting the cop?
[03:14:25.305 --> 03:14:25.725]  Woo!
[03:14:25.805 --> 03:14:27.847]  No, no, that's like Israel and Syria.
[03:14:28.187 --> 03:14:34.753]  Israel's in the Times of Israel, says Israel will bring down Assad if he retaliates for further airstrikes.
[03:14:35.093 --> 03:14:38.215]  And they say, if you respond in any way, we will then carpet bomb you.
[03:14:38.796 --> 03:14:39.817]  That is sick!
[03:14:41.316 --> 03:14:41.817]  Think about it.
[03:14:42.017 --> 03:14:45.379]  I'm going to bomb you, and if you respond, we're going to really invade you.
[03:14:46.679 --> 03:14:48.100]  Which is what we want to do anyway.
[03:14:48.561 --> 03:14:54.784]  Okay, but if you dare to defend... Syria for two years is laying there and taking our government and others putting Al-Qaeda in.
[03:14:55.185 --> 03:14:55.745]  You know the good news?
[03:14:55.765 --> 03:14:56.746]  I was reading the Israeli papers.
[03:14:57.046 --> 03:14:59.287]  Half the comments are going, why are we funding Al-Qaeda?
[03:14:59.447 --> 03:14:59.887]  Exactly.
[03:15:00.228 --> 03:15:01.969]  I mean, even the Israelis are going, this is wrong.
[03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:07.072]  I mean, it's like seeing Syria lay there for two years and take it is finally getting through to people.
[03:15:07.132 --> 03:15:07.472]  It is.
[03:15:07.832 --> 03:15:08.112]  It is.
[03:15:08.413 --> 03:15:09.193]  Syria's smart.
[03:15:09.393 --> 03:15:10.314]  I mean, you know, it's...
[03:15:11.178 --> 03:15:14.021]  What they're doing, their tactics, they're definitely smart.
[03:15:14.242 --> 03:15:16.885]  Because they, I think they understood.
[03:15:16.905 --> 03:15:17.946]  At least some of them.
[03:15:18.206 --> 03:15:19.888]  Well no, it's admitted to Sod Ridge Info Wars.
[03:15:19.908 --> 03:15:21.910]  And I'm not saying he's a great guy, but that's come out.
[03:15:22.050 --> 03:15:24.573]  It's not a question of great guy, no great guy.
[03:15:24.653 --> 03:15:25.715]  It's a question of the people.
[03:15:26.215 --> 03:15:26.675]  The people.
[03:15:26.915 --> 03:15:29.276]  This is not a struggle in Syria of the people.
[03:15:29.356 --> 03:15:31.437]  Al-Qaeda is killing the Alawite minority.
[03:15:31.537 --> 03:15:31.877]  Exactly.
[03:15:31.897 --> 03:15:33.537]  And the Christian, lining them up and killing them.
[03:15:33.817 --> 03:15:45.821]  That's turning all the people, I've talked to high-level Sunnis who would be with the Sunnis that are doing this, but they're doing war crimes, so the Syrians are now unifying against it.
[03:15:45.921 --> 03:15:46.721]  Right, right.
[03:15:46.961 --> 03:15:48.102]  That's the power of the people.
[03:15:48.122 --> 03:15:49.042]  It's backfiring though.
[03:15:49.082 --> 03:15:53.003]  Why do psychos always think beating us and attacking us is going to intimidate us?
[03:15:53.083 --> 03:15:57.727]  Because that's the way they figured that's what they think, therefore that's the way we think.
[03:15:57.787 --> 03:15:59.328]  But that's not the way we think.
[03:15:59.528 --> 03:16:00.789]  It's not the way we think.
[03:16:00.990 --> 03:16:02.811]  And we're not going to accept that narrative.
[03:16:02.991 --> 03:16:03.932]  We're going to be creative.
[03:16:04.172 --> 03:16:05.994]  We're going to come up with our own narrative.
[03:16:06.314 --> 03:16:11.619]  And you know, I was thinking as you were talking about Syria, I was also thinking about the same thing happened in Libya.
[03:16:12.259 --> 03:16:12.679]  Same thing.
[03:16:13.640 --> 03:16:18.022]  Am I saying Gaddafi, Muammar Gaddafi, was good or bad?
[03:16:18.082 --> 03:16:18.702]  I'm not saying either.
[03:16:18.722 --> 03:16:20.023]  Well, he was actually good for Africa.
[03:16:20.063 --> 03:16:20.543]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:16:20.603 --> 03:16:21.904]  You could say it was for ego or whatever.
[03:16:21.944 --> 03:16:25.866]  He gave most of the money to build up infrastructure, and he was actually lifting Africa up.
[03:16:25.926 --> 03:16:26.146]  Yes.
[03:16:26.306 --> 03:16:28.827]  And he said the government's putting HIV in the shots, which they caught him.
[03:16:28.947 --> 03:16:29.167]  Right.
[03:16:29.267 --> 03:16:34.110]  I gotta say, you know, compared to... The fact is he was definitely becoming a good guy.
[03:16:34.150 --> 03:16:34.670]  That's why they did it.
[03:16:34.810 --> 03:16:34.970]  Yeah.
[03:16:35.150 --> 03:16:37.472]  Well, and also... Well, I mean, they got his money to invest.
[03:16:37.512 --> 03:16:38.432]  He came into the West.
[03:16:38.452 --> 03:16:38.773]  Right, right.
[03:16:38.793 --> 03:16:39.693]  Said, I want to be friends.
[03:16:40.054 --> 03:16:42.115]  Well, see, you destabilize a region.
[03:16:42.235 --> 03:16:43.316]  I don't mean you, obviously.
[03:16:43.416 --> 03:16:44.196]  No, no, no.
[03:16:44.216 --> 03:16:44.837]  America.
[03:16:44.857 --> 03:16:45.117]  Yes.
[03:16:45.497 --> 03:16:49.100]  This corporate government destabilizes a region.
[03:16:49.260 --> 03:16:51.241]  There's a method to their madness.
[03:16:51.461 --> 03:16:52.982]  They are quite insane, by the way.
[03:16:53.302 --> 03:16:55.084]  But there's a method to their madness.
[03:16:55.124 --> 03:16:56.525]  You destabilize that region.
[03:16:56.745 --> 03:17:00.287]  You send it in like a cancer to infest the area.
[03:17:00.307 --> 03:17:01.048]  The last thing that...
[03:17:05.010 --> 03:17:15.273]  You know, the Obamatrons, and the Republicrats, Democrats, the last thing they want, the last thing they want is a stable country, a stable government.
[03:17:15.293 --> 03:17:26.636]  But Bush, just like Webster Tarpley and our other guest said, and Professor Griff, in Obama Deception 1 that we made five years ago, or four, yeah, five years ago, is that they gotta have a black face to invade with AFRICON.
[03:17:27.216 --> 03:17:39.262]  And we even predicted they're going to take over Libya and then have Al-Qaeda attack, and then have the West invade Africa to kill Al-Qaeda, but they won't even kill Al-Qaeda, they'll kill the groups they want, knowing Americans can't even find Africa on a map.
[03:17:39.342 --> 03:17:39.842]  Exactly.
[03:17:40.163 --> 03:17:41.883]  And so it's like, we're killing Al-Qaeda!
[03:17:42.564 --> 03:17:44.405]  And meanwhile the government put Al-Qaeda in!
[03:17:44.525 --> 03:17:44.745]  Right.
[03:17:45.005 --> 03:17:56.631]  They developed Al-Qaeda, they groomed Al-Qaeda, they made Al-Qaeda, they created Al-Qaeda, and... They arm Al-Qaeda, they put Al-Qaeda in, and then say we're going to invade Africa to get Al-Qaeda, and then they don't even go get Al-Qaeda!
[03:17:57.151 --> 03:17:58.752]  They go kill the great fighting al Qaeda!
[03:17:58.812 --> 03:17:59.953]  Of course, of course.
[03:18:00.113 --> 03:18:02.515]  And again, I smile, it's not funny.
[03:18:02.535 --> 03:18:03.296]  It's sick.
[03:18:03.436 --> 03:18:03.856]  It's sick.
[03:18:04.056 --> 03:18:04.497]  It really is.
[03:18:04.537 --> 03:18:07.819]  It was an incredible crime against humanity to do that to Libya.
[03:18:07.839 --> 03:18:08.060]  Yes.
[03:18:08.640 --> 03:18:15.585]  But our power is, our power collectively, as a people, black, white, brown, red, yellow people, our power is knowledge.
[03:18:15.625 --> 03:18:16.166]  We know this.
[03:18:16.506 --> 03:18:16.966]  We know this.
[03:18:16.986 --> 03:18:18.107]  So what are we going to do about it?
[03:18:18.328 --> 03:18:21.310]  We're going to reach out, we're going to connect with each other.
[03:18:21.630 --> 03:18:28.314]  We're going to come up with ways and means, as Brother Malcolm said, we're going to go in the closet, but boy, when we come out of that closet, we're going to be united.
[03:18:28.734 --> 03:18:31.155]  And we're going to have our disagreement, but we're going to have them in the closet.
[03:18:31.176 --> 03:18:36.679]  Well, I mean, look, it's a crime to go to a stable country, destroy it, and then engage in ethnic cleansing.
[03:18:36.719 --> 03:18:36.919]  Right.
[03:18:37.479 --> 03:18:40.441]  Of black Africans, you know, 40,000 wound up and killed so far.
[03:18:40.821 --> 03:18:42.862]  Did that wake up the black community to Obama?
[03:18:42.882 --> 03:18:44.163]  I noticed it woke up Farrakhan.
[03:18:45.123 --> 03:18:45.403]  Yes.
[03:18:45.743 --> 03:18:46.904]  I mean, to a certain extent.
[03:18:46.924 --> 03:18:52.106]  I mean, he came out and criticized his brother Obama when they did that in Libya, because that really is a crime.
[03:18:52.366 --> 03:18:59.348]  Well, it woke up, to some degree, some other folks, too, such as Amari Baraka, aka Leroy Jones.
[03:19:00.629 --> 03:19:03.209]  But, you know, we'll see if it was genuine or not.
[03:19:03.330 --> 03:19:03.790]  I don't know.
[03:19:03.870 --> 03:19:04.510]  I can't say.
[03:19:04.830 --> 03:19:08.031]  Now, speaking for everyday, just everyday black folk, okay?
[03:19:09.391 --> 03:19:16.814]  I think it is beginning to have an impact, especially among young blacks who are going, well, wait a minute, something doesn't compute here.
[03:19:17.234 --> 03:19:20.235]  We're over here, we're bombing, but somebody's got to tell them!
[03:19:20.675 --> 03:19:22.856]  That information has got to be gotten to them.
[03:19:23.217 --> 03:19:25.498]  They've got to understand Libya is North Africa.
[03:19:25.538 --> 03:19:27.980]  They've got to understand Somalia is East Africa.
[03:19:28.200 --> 03:19:35.744]  They've got to understand that what is going on, and when you look at Syria, where is Syria in relation to Africa?
[03:19:36.045 --> 03:19:38.766]  It's not on the African continent, but it's extremely close.
[03:19:38.946 --> 03:19:40.427]  But again, I'm not from Africa.
[03:19:40.447 --> 03:19:41.748]  Well, I guess originally everybody is.
[03:19:41.968 --> 03:19:44.030]  But the point is, I have empathy.
[03:19:44.370 --> 03:19:47.452]  In fact, I would tell young black folks, why do you only care about something in Central Africa?
[03:19:48.072 --> 03:19:56.200]  I mean, I care about if they're committing a war crime in Libya, or in Syria, or in Jordan, or in the Balkans.
[03:19:56.380 --> 03:19:56.981]  Exactly.
[03:19:57.341 --> 03:19:57.761]  Exactly.
[03:19:57.861 --> 03:19:59.363]  I mean, I don't care who it's happening to.
[03:19:59.423 --> 03:20:00.664]  If it's wrong, we'll be right back.
[03:20:00.684 --> 03:20:01.205]  Let's do some more.
[03:20:01.285 --> 03:20:02.486]  Introducing Pro1.

[03:20:11.334 --> 03:20:17.319]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[03:20:17.439 --> 03:20:28.427]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.

[03:21:01.434 --> 03:21:03.335]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[03:21:03.815 --> 03:21:06.936]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[03:21:07.357 --> 03:21:10.938]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[03:21:11.318 --> 03:21:16.881]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[03:21:17.221 --> 03:21:19.762]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[03:21:20.122 --> 03:21:27.085]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[03:21:27.665 --> 03:21:33.131]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[03:21:33.531 --> 03:21:39.357]  EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.

[03:22:31.387 --> 03:22:35.770]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:22:35.950 --> 03:22:41.654]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:22:41.754 --> 03:22:45.176]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[03:24:12.389 --> 03:24:13.971]  Final segment with Larry Pinkney.
[03:24:13.991 --> 03:24:15.433]  It's hard to get off air with him.
[03:24:16.073 --> 03:24:17.595]  And I think you're going to be on the Nightly News.
[03:24:17.615 --> 03:24:20.258]  I don't know if Jakari Jackson's doing it or who's doing it, but you're invited to that.
[03:24:20.278 --> 03:24:21.580]  I don't want to exhaust you too much.
[03:24:21.600 --> 03:24:28.047]  We're going to get some good Austin Pollo Rico here, and then we're going to do an interview for Obama Deception 2.
[03:24:28.728 --> 03:24:30.830]  Obama, Cynthia McKinney has said and others.
[03:24:31.531 --> 03:24:34.073]  It's not that he's a lesser of two evils, he's more effective.
[03:24:34.573 --> 03:24:41.158]  And when the whole evil globalist culture says he's our savior, I knew, oh my gosh, get ready, they're going to be able to run the whole thing here.
[03:24:41.338 --> 03:24:45.081]  But you know, I mean, I knew about some of your early on past Marxist-Leninist type stuff.
[03:24:45.101 --> 03:24:46.602]  People would ask me, why would you have Larry Pinckney on?
[03:24:46.862 --> 03:24:54.087]  Because I've watched over the years how you've expanded, you were describing it as populism, you know, seeing these are all tools of control.
[03:24:54.708 --> 03:24:56.569]  What is your view now politically?
[03:24:56.589 --> 03:24:56.889]  Because now,
[03:24:58.231 --> 03:25:05.400]  Yeah, well, as you and I were talking about, Alex, the bottom line is, yes, I studied Marx-Leninism, Marxist-Leninism, Maoism.
[03:25:05.420 --> 03:25:07.783]  Yeah, I studied these things.
[03:25:08.384 --> 03:25:14.672]  But the more I began to... and that doesn't mean that I don't have some respect for some aspects.
[03:25:15.293 --> 03:25:18.036]  But I evolved, and I'm still evolving.
[03:25:18.496 --> 03:25:23.121]  I'm evolving into a peopleist, a populist.
[03:25:23.401 --> 03:25:28.467]  You see, any kind of ideology, be it right-wing, left-wing, or any... It's always going to go to the individual.
[03:25:28.527 --> 03:25:29.948]  Yes, that's it.
[03:25:30.308 --> 03:25:35.334]  But it's an individualism where you love the individual, but then it creates a true diverse
[03:25:36.014 --> 03:25:38.776]  Uh, collectivism, not the false collectivism.
[03:25:39.056 --> 03:25:46.601]  Notice the big mega-banks are always funding communism, just like Carol Quigley said, because it's another central control, like fascism.
[03:25:46.661 --> 03:26:01.371]  Have you evolved, and I'm not saying I have all the answers, but have you evolved to the fact that it's got to be individual, but individuals have to then band together, and that basically, more of a real libertarian philosophy, not the fake corporatist, where it's a corporate collectivism.
[03:26:01.591 --> 03:26:02.832]  See, I mean, all these terms mean nothing.
[03:26:02.872 --> 03:26:03.392]  Right, right.
[03:26:03.492 --> 03:26:04.733]  How would you describe yourself now, then?
[03:26:04.813 --> 03:26:12.115]  I would describe myself as moving very strongly and quickly towards populism, alright?
[03:26:12.355 --> 03:26:19.878]  This is why it's so important for me to be able to speak and communicate with anyone from any ideology, any ideology, okay?
[03:26:20.518 --> 03:26:22.939]  I refuse to be narrow.
[03:26:23.439 --> 03:26:25.140]  Oh, it's gotta be a Marxist-Leninist!
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:27.220]  Oh, it's gotta be dialectical materialism!
[03:26:27.320 --> 03:26:28.641]  Oh, it's gotta be, it's like, please!
[03:26:29.241 --> 03:26:29.621]  Please!
[03:26:29.641 --> 03:26:30.842]  You want to get out of the box?
[03:26:30.902 --> 03:26:31.162]  Yes!
[03:26:31.342 --> 03:26:34.543]  We've got to all get out of this box, if we really want change.
[03:26:34.843 --> 03:26:37.884]  Now, if we don't really want change, then stop the BS.
[03:26:38.444 --> 03:26:40.525]  Stop the BS, please, please, please.
[03:26:40.845 --> 03:26:43.466]  Be honest, and say, I don't really want change.
[03:26:43.506 --> 03:26:44.566]  I'm comfortable where I am.
[03:26:44.606 --> 03:26:46.707]  I'm comfortable intellectually masturbating.
[03:26:46.747 --> 03:26:47.347]  I like that!
[03:26:47.888 --> 03:26:48.668]  Okay, be honest!
[03:26:49.168 --> 03:26:57.111]  But no, I believe that if we are going to have people change, then we'd better get the heck out of the box.
[03:26:57.651 --> 03:26:58.852]  The sooner, the better.
[03:26:58.972 --> 03:26:59.333]  Exactly.
[03:26:59.353 --> 03:27:03.636]  We don't want to replace one crony capitalist system with a crony communist system.
[03:27:04.217 --> 03:27:07.520]  We want to, I mean I say it, get back to the Enlightenment, the Renaissance.
[03:27:08.140 --> 03:27:11.183]  It's all about breaking up the cartels and empowering the individual.
[03:27:11.243 --> 03:27:11.423]  Right.
[03:27:11.623 --> 03:27:12.584]  And that's what they're scared of.
[03:27:12.644 --> 03:27:12.845]  Right.
[03:27:12.925 --> 03:27:19.571]  Harold Quigley said we like fascism, we like communism, we like socialism, we like it all because we can buy off whoever's in charge.
[03:27:20.191 --> 03:27:27.618]  Just like they didn't like Gaddafi because he created a socialism, but it actually delivered 90% of the stuff to the people and built infrastructure.
[03:27:28.079 --> 03:27:33.184]  They want a communism where it's a bunch of royal commies up in their little command center, everybody else are slaves.
[03:27:33.204 --> 03:27:38.349]  And that's, I think that's a very, very important point that you've just made.
[03:27:38.569 --> 03:27:40.010]  You see, any kind of ism
[03:27:41.041 --> 03:27:45.682]  Capitalism, communism, socialism, ask yourself what they really mean.
[03:27:46.463 --> 03:27:47.643]  What does that really mean?
[03:27:48.143 --> 03:27:53.185]  It means, your description, I'm going to have to keep that one in mind, watch this program, because I like the way you describe that.
[03:27:53.525 --> 03:27:58.246]  They want a palatial elite, if you will.
[03:27:58.806 --> 03:28:06.669]  They don't mind if they have a palatial elite, whether they call it communism, capitalism, socialism, whatever other ism they're going to come up with next.
[03:28:07.591 --> 03:28:32.280]  But we, the people, have got to understand that if we are to really empower ourselves, I use that word again, but if we're really to empower ourselves, we have to dispense with that, we have to reach out to each other, we have to be honest, which is why I began earlier in this program, I began by saying, Alex, where is the so-called left now that drone man Obama is bombing and killing and maiming?
[03:28:32.420 --> 03:28:32.900]  Where is he?
[03:28:32.940 --> 03:28:36.642]  They feel like they're in charge now, reflected glory, so they bought into it.
[03:28:37.102 --> 03:28:37.302]  Right.
[03:28:37.542 --> 03:28:38.743]  So what is that?
[03:28:38.803 --> 03:28:39.783]  That's hypocrisy.
[03:28:40.143 --> 03:28:41.023]  That's deceit.
[03:28:41.624 --> 03:28:42.484]  It's hypocrisy.
[03:28:43.164 --> 03:28:44.525]  It's not being principled.
[03:28:44.885 --> 03:28:46.205]  We have got to be principled.
[03:28:46.425 --> 03:28:48.706]  That's more important than any idiocy.
[03:28:48.766 --> 03:28:49.246]  Exactly.
[03:28:49.286 --> 03:28:51.647]  If a Republican was in charge doing this, I'd be against them.
[03:28:52.187 --> 03:28:53.928]  If people say, well, why are you bashing Obama?
[03:28:53.968 --> 03:28:55.828]  Well, back when I didn't like Bush, I was a communist.
[03:28:56.109 --> 03:28:57.089]  Now I don't like Obama.
[03:28:57.649 --> 03:28:59.210]  I'm a right-wing racist extremist.
[03:28:59.230 --> 03:28:59.910]  There's nothing to do with that.
[03:29:00.490 --> 03:29:08.238]  I want justice, and I want to get our Bill of Rights and Constitution back, and I want to get true independence back, because it creates so much wealth.
[03:29:08.679 --> 03:29:10.981]  Our only problem is our kids become decadent slobs.
[03:29:11.882 --> 03:29:15.846]  I mean, nothing turns loose liberty like
[03:29:16.792 --> 03:29:19.414]  People being able to be upwardly mobile.
[03:29:19.514 --> 03:29:22.235]  And the mega cartels, everything they can to block that.
[03:29:22.255 --> 03:29:22.816]  We're out of time.
[03:29:23.176 --> 03:29:24.677]  Larry Pinckney will be back on the Nightly News.
[03:29:24.697 --> 03:29:25.757]  We're going to exhaust you today.
[03:29:26.218 --> 03:29:28.719]  We're going to interview you for Obama Deception 2 next.
[03:29:29.159 --> 03:29:31.261]  And then we're going to get you on the Nightly News if you want to do that.
[03:29:31.661 --> 03:29:33.102]  And it's just great meeting you in person.
[03:29:33.202 --> 03:29:34.243]  Thank you so much.
[03:29:34.283 --> 03:29:35.503]  You know I love being here.
[03:29:35.763 --> 03:29:36.284]  Absolutely.
[03:29:36.324 --> 03:29:36.864]  It's awesome.
[03:29:36.904 --> 03:29:40.907]  Ladies and gentlemen, Black Activist, WG.org.
[03:29:41.307 --> 03:29:42.828]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[03:29:42.848 --> 03:29:44.569]  Go see the Mike Judge teaser.
[03:29:45.311 --> 03:29:46.312]  Ah, this is Hank Hill.
[03:29:46.752 --> 03:29:48.654]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[03:29:48.934 --> 03:29:50.135]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:29:50.476 --> 03:29:51.396]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.877 --> 03:29:53.458]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.478 --> 03:29:57.242]  Alex Jones and the GTN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.465 --> 03:30:02.666]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:02.886 --> 03:30:13.315]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
