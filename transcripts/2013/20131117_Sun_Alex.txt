[00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:15.466]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:21.250]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.593]  It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:27.995]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[00:00:30.487 --> 00:00:37.332]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:59.461]  Well, Washington, Illinois has seen a big tornado and other tornadoes have been popping up in that area of the country, a natural phenomenon that is sad but true to be part of our environment, part of living on this planet.
[00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:09.627]  There have always been storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, but you can bet that the establishment will seize on this and say the answer to all of our problems
[00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:36.186]  is basically paying more carbon taxes to Lord Rothschild and Al Gore and people like Barack Obama who has heavy investments in the Chicago mercantile carbon exchange and Obama doesn't care if Congress won't pass a law letting them basically put in carbon taxes by stealth, he'll just do it.
[00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:37.046]  With presidential
[00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:44.358]  He doesn't even do it by executive orders or even PDDs a lot of the time.
[00:01:44.358 --> 00:01:55.486]  Earlier this year, just a few months ago, they had a footnote in a federal regulation with the president's guidelines.
[00:01:55.486 --> 00:01:59.129]  So he basically operates more and more as a dictator.
[00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:02.151]  And there's been a long, long march towards this.
[00:02:04.198 --> 00:02:08.340]  But now you see Obama saying, I'll just legalize the illegals by fiat.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.241]  He's basically already done it.
[00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:14.363]  Or, I'll fix Obamacare, my own legislation, without Congress.
[00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:20.687]  I can just speak law out of my mouth like I am the emperor.
[00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:24.909]  And we see him with so many other regulations now doing this.
[00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.050]  It's a big deal.
[00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.653]  And the big question is, will people recognize foundational tyranny
[00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:38.526]  When it's staring them in the face?
[00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:44.058]  Or will we accept it and fail the test and go into the long, hard night that is tyranny?
[00:02:47.628 --> 00:02:51.070]  That is a extremely important question for everyone.
[00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.210]  And I'm going to do it today.
[00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.571]  I have a lot of video clips and audio clips I want to play.
[00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:59.874]  I have a lot of new Obamacare nightmare information.
[00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:02.895]  Very important NSA information.
[00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:04.656]  It's all coming up today.
[00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:09.959]  And there's a ton of news at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and in sundry sites.
[00:03:12.608 --> 00:03:15.350]  And we've got video, obviously, of what's a big national news story.
[00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.275]  Cop fires on minivan full of children that leaves the scene.
[00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:27.040]  And the establishment is defending firing into a vehicle that you know is full of children to maintain control of the situation.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:38.850]  I agree, they should implant explosives at age two inside everyone's skull by remote control so that just in case there's a problem they can detonate it and, you know,
[00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:40.623]  Blow a big hole in your brain.
[00:03:40.623 --> 00:03:42.144]  Of course, I shouldn't talk like that.
[00:03:42.144 --> 00:03:44.165]  I'll actually give them ideas.
[00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:50.008]  You know, the necklaces they have to wear in the running man at the prisons, they can blow your head off.
[00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:59.754]  Again, DHS is seriously considering trying to make all airline passengers wear a taser bracelet for our safety, of course.
[00:03:59.754 --> 00:04:02.135]  So there's no doubt that we're going into a great tyranny.
[00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:04.477]  There's no doubt that this is happening.
[00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.999]  And there's no doubt that we as a society
[00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.399]  Need to have a serious discussion about it, and I'm going to open the phones up today for first-time callers to give me your take on these issues and more.
[00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:29.214]  We have Oprah Winfrey, while all of humanity's basically being domesticated, enslaved, dumbed down, says that racists have to die for racism to end.
[00:04:31.377 --> 00:04:37.222]  Well, racism is not going to ever go away with a system that lives off of divide and conquer.
[00:04:37.222 --> 00:04:46.570]  That's really all racism is, is divide and conquer tribalism, if you reduce it down to its most basic, scientific, geopolitical form.
[00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.192]  And Obama is a great guy.
[00:04:49.192 --> 00:04:51.394]  If you criticize him, you're racist, she goes on to say.
[00:04:52.847 --> 00:04:55.991]  That's just some of what is coming up today.
[00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:57.453]  Stay with us, it's a big transmission.
[00:04:57.453 --> 00:04:59.196]  We're live, by the way, it's the 17th.
[00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:01.118]  Introducing Pro-Wine.
[00:05:01.118 --> 00:05:04.743]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:05:04.743 --> 00:05:09.149]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:15.394]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:26.404]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:05:26.404 --> 00:05:29.066]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:32.868]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:50.195]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia, and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:05:50.195 --> 00:05:55.498]  Get your ProPure with the new Pro1 filters today at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:17.526]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:06:17.526 --> 00:06:23.429]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:29.491]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:32.032]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:33.013]  A new world order.
[00:06:36.664 --> 00:06:39.690]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.617]  It just pancaked.
[00:06:43.617 --> 00:06:47.423]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:06.183]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.640]  Guns will be taken.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.161]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:14.401]  We're going to take all guns.
[00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:19.223]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:20.784]  Global governance at last.
[00:07:20.784 --> 00:07:21.764]  Is it one world?
[00:07:21.764 --> 00:07:23.465]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:27.046]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:33.348]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:07:33.348 --> 00:07:38.030]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:50.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday edition, the 17th day of November 2013.
[00:07:52.827 --> 00:07:57.488]  We're going to be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:57.488 --> 00:07:58.228]  Central.
[00:07:58.228 --> 00:07:59.949]  Then I return weekdays 11 a.m.
[00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:00.509]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:02.489]  Central with a weekday transmission.
[00:08:02.489 --> 00:08:04.030]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.770]  Eastern.
[00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.490]  And of course we have InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:15.552]  Find details 7 o'clock Central every night at InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:15.552 --> 00:08:18.553]  Obviously here is the big news.
[00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:27.327]  Two old foes unite against Tehran, the capital of Iran.
[00:08:27.327 --> 00:08:38.694]  Saudi Arabia, one of the most corrupt, vicious, evil countries on earth, undoubtedly, who was just made part of the UN Human Rights Council this week.
[00:08:38.694 --> 00:08:41.656]  That'd be like having North Korea over the council.
[00:08:41.656 --> 00:08:44.398]  Two old foes unite
[00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:46.883]  I don't know.
[00:09:07.992 --> 00:09:11.575]  Other governments like the Saudis.
[00:09:11.575 --> 00:09:20.581]  And I pause there because it's just so amazing how much danger our society and our culture is in right now.
[00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:23.023]  And our very species.
[00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:30.128]  When you've got all these different out-of-control governments from Iran to the Saudis to Israel to the Russians to the U.S.
[00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:31.409]  to the Communist Chinese.
[00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:34.581]  These governments really all act the same.
[00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:36.282]  They're authoritarian.
[00:09:36.282 --> 00:09:38.565]  They are reducing their own people's liberty.
[00:09:38.565 --> 00:09:42.710]  They are using international and domestic crises to take freedoms.
[00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:51.380]  They're all a governing class that historically will take countries to war and millions will die.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.922]  Now we've got nuclear weapons.
[00:09:54.338 --> 00:10:07.149]  Now governments have biological weapons, chemical weapons, and if something like this kicks off, most analysts have said on record, there is a very good chance that it's going to start a nuclear war.
[00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:18.459]  Now my intel, from multiple high-level military sources, is that the Pentagon has believed, for at least six years,
[00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:27.626]  That Iran was able to get parts and fissile material and build atomic bombs.
[00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:31.046]  Not with the peaceful centrifuges they're putting together.
[00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:34.007]  Not with the fact that they want nuclear power.
[00:10:34.007 --> 00:10:35.947]  Because they can't even refine their own fuel.
[00:10:35.947 --> 00:10:39.868]  They're oil rich but don't have the infrastructure to refine it.
[00:10:39.868 --> 00:10:44.549]  They really do want nuclear energy to power themselves.
[00:10:46.055 --> 00:10:51.797]  But the intel I've got is they got parts of it from the Russians and parts of it from the Pakistanis.
[00:10:51.797 --> 00:10:59.979]  And what's crazy about the Sunday Times of London article and the Haritz article and the Jerusalem Post article, they're all reporting it right now.
[00:10:59.979 --> 00:11:02.299]  Stories are up on Infowars.com.
[00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:04.260]  They're also linked and read on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.640]  It's an easy place to find them.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:12.302]  Over on the right-hand side, that Saudi Arabia has already bought hydrogen bombs
[00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:30.474]  The more powerful weapons from the Pakistanis with the blessings of the United States, NATO, and Israel, and that if Iran goes nuclear, that Saudi Arabia is going to have the weapons flown in.
[00:11:30.474 --> 00:11:42.624]  Now folks, all this is is the preparation for the world to know that Saudi Arabia already has nuclear weapons, and I've told you this before, Saudi Arabia is the group that may nuke
[00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.893]  Iran.
[00:11:45.893 --> 00:11:48.015]  And in that way, it's Arabs killing Arabs.
[00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:50.937]  See, that's the new policy, or Muslims killing Muslims.
[00:11:50.937 --> 00:11:54.400]  Technically, a lot of the Iranians are Persian.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.143]  It's originally a Persian country, but it's adopted a lot of Arabic culture.
[00:11:58.143 --> 00:12:04.088]  The point is, it's a crossroads there at the beginning of Central Asia.
[00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:11.494]  And you notice the globalist Zbigniew Brzezinski model of proxy states and proxy wars.
[00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:27.765]  You've got proxy states, you've got proxy wars, and you notice they're using Sunnis out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other areas, which is 80% of Islam, the majority group, to attack Shiite strongholds in Iran, in
[00:12:30.327 --> 00:12:33.608]  Other areas like Syria.
[00:12:33.608 --> 00:12:36.769]  So geopolitically, that's what's going on right now.
[00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:38.370]  And it's not me saying this now.
[00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.651]  It's not Alex Jones saying this a year ago or six months ago or a week ago.
[00:12:42.651 --> 00:12:48.113]  It's now mainstream news.
[00:12:48.113 --> 00:12:51.454]  Oh yeah, here's the crazy part.
[00:12:51.454 --> 00:12:55.335]  Here's the really crazy part.
[00:12:55.335 --> 00:12:57.956]  They're saying if the peace talks succeed,
[00:12:59.509 --> 00:13:26.874]  In France right now, between NATO and the United States and the French and others, that if those nuclear talks with the UN and Iran, Tehran, their capital, their governing class, if those peace talks succeed and
[00:13:30.336 --> 00:13:35.499]  Folks like Saudi Arabia, Israel and others don't like what's in the peace talks.
[00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:40.481]  They're basically menacing the whole peace talk and terrorizing the peace talk.
[00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:41.522]  That's what it is.
[00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:48.706]  Terrorism is a threat of violence or violence for a political aim.
[00:13:48.706 --> 00:13:51.727]  And that's what this is.
[00:13:51.727 --> 00:13:56.069]  That's what the system is doing.
[00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:57.310]  And so it's a big deal.
[00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.631]  And again, I'm not
[00:14:00.211 --> 00:14:10.317]  I'm not anti-Israel, I'm not anti-Iran, I'm not anti-Alawite, I'm not anti-Sunni, I'm not anti-Shiite, but it doesn't matter.
[00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:15.921]  If you don't take a side, the groups that you don't take a side with will attack you.
[00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:21.184]  When I'm taking the side of humanity and peace and not wanting to have a nuclear war,
[00:14:22.336 --> 00:14:42.273]  Even the hawk, General Dempsey, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chairman, a few months ago at midnight went to the White House and literally told Obama, because the strike was coming on that Saturday morning, on Friday night he told him, the Pentagon is basically going to stand down and we've got top generals and people and admirals threatening to resign.
[00:14:42.273 --> 00:14:47.297]  And Obama didn't want them to all resign right then, so he stood down for
[00:14:48.902 --> 00:15:04.573]  For a month or so, then they started ordering all these top generals fired for the reasons they could dig up, instead of pointing out, you're fired because you wouldn't back Al-Qaeda, and an open US-NATO bombardment backing Al-Qaeda, and an attack on Syria.
[00:15:04.573 --> 00:15:09.736]  So, this is really historical stuff that's going on right now.
[00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:14.440]  And, my intel is, from multiple high-level sources,
[00:15:15.356 --> 00:15:31.656]  And this isn't Pentagon propaganda for the public, this is internally, is the Pentagon doesn't want to hit Iran, and I was told this about five and a half years ago first and then about two years ago by a separate source, that that's why the Pentagon, they're not afraid to go start aggressive wars and stuff, they love it.
[00:15:32.526 --> 00:15:43.331]  The issue is they've done the math, the war games, the computer scenarios, and a very good chance it's going to bring Russia and China in, and Pakistan and India, and a big nuke free-for-all, and really go south fast.
[00:15:43.331 --> 00:15:45.111]  That's in the cards.
[00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.812]  And they're like, why attack Iran?
[00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:49.233]  They've already got weapons!
[00:15:49.233 --> 00:15:52.674]  And that's what Israel and Saudi Arabia want to do, is take those systems out.
[00:15:52.674 --> 00:15:54.415]  You're not going to get those systems.
[00:15:54.415 --> 00:15:58.377]  You're going to give Iran an excuse to strike back and have the moral high ground.
[00:16:00.874 --> 00:16:06.335]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:16:06.335 --> 00:16:15.238]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:16:15.238 --> 00:16:23.060]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:30.442]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[00:16:59.986 --> 00:17:04.712]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:17:04.712 --> 00:17:07.836]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:17:07.836 --> 00:17:13.403]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:17:13.403 --> 00:17:15.005]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:16.946]  We are what we eat.
[00:17:16.946 --> 00:17:21.629]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:25.852]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[00:17:25.852 --> 00:17:28.414]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:34.638]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:18:00.464 --> 00:18:07.088]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:18:07.088 --> 00:18:09.589]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:09.949]  The U.S.
[00:18:09.949 --> 00:18:14.171]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:18:14.171 --> 00:18:17.133]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:18.614]  They want that attack to come.
[00:18:18.614 --> 00:18:24.837]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:18:25.197 --> 00:18:27.860]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.846]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:40.275]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:18:40.595 --> 00:18:43.337]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:18:43.337 --> 00:18:46.460]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:51.003]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:10.187]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:19:10.187 --> 00:19:12.249]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:19:12.249 --> 00:19:13.129]  Fluoride.
[00:19:13.129 --> 00:19:15.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:21.635]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:26.558]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:19:26.558 --> 00:19:29.260]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.100]  We're good.
[00:20:01.232 --> 00:20:04.814]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.814 --> 00:20:08.135]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:17.719]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:20:26.898 --> 00:20:39.147]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:39.147 --> 00:20:42.449]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live on this Sunday edition.
[00:20:42.449 --> 00:20:49.574]  If you just joined us, it's being reported by the Sunday Times of London and all the major Israeli newspapers.
[00:20:49.574 --> 00:20:53.937]  It should be even bigger news, but folks are more concerned about Oprah Winfrey saying,
[00:20:55.086 --> 00:20:58.448]  That anyone that doesn't like Obama is racist and needs to die.
[00:20:58.448 --> 00:21:00.169]  I'm going to play that clip coming up in a moment.
[00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:05.032]  It's pretty amazing when you see it in the full context of just how whacked out this woman is.
[00:21:06.428 --> 00:21:14.074]  We're on the verge of what could become a giant regional war that will drive up oil prices conservatively two to three times, most analysts agree.
[00:21:14.074 --> 00:21:15.875]  Some analysts say five times.
[00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:19.518]  Shutting down the Straits of Hormuz, Suez Canal.
[00:21:19.518 --> 00:21:23.281]  All Hades will break loose across Central Asia and the Middle East.
[00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:25.863]  You won't have to have the government stage terror attacks.
[00:21:25.863 --> 00:21:29.425]  There will be real sleeper cells will come out of the woodwork.
[00:21:29.425 --> 00:21:32.648]  And they've geared up with Homeland Security, I guess, for this conflict to happen.
[00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.793]  And then they'll just use this new war as an excuse to take even more liberties.
[00:21:37.793 --> 00:21:44.899]  They've got the Cyber Command in place, as Wired Magazine reports, designed to attack freedom on the internet and attack the American people.
[00:21:44.899 --> 00:21:48.502]  We're being attacked by our own government that's been hijacked by foreign interest.
[00:21:48.502 --> 00:21:51.184]  They're busy running around stirring stuff up worldwide.
[00:21:51.184 --> 00:21:52.665]  It's order out of chaos.
[00:21:52.665 --> 00:21:56.929]  And then out of all these crises, the globalists believe they will bring their order.
[00:21:59.383 --> 00:22:00.903]  And it's very, very frustrating.
[00:22:00.903 --> 00:22:20.008]  And then while we see Obamacare and Obama coming out and saying, I will dictatorially fix Obamacare and get you back on your old insurance plan, even though top Democrats like Howard Dean have come out and said, you can't.
[00:22:20.008 --> 00:22:21.208]  It's the law.
[00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:22.329]  You don't have that authority.
[00:22:22.329 --> 00:22:23.149]  You're not a dictator.
[00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:25.122]  Don't you see how it works?
[00:22:25.122 --> 00:22:29.424]  Oh, no, you've got to give me dictatorial powers now, and then I'll get you that free health care.
[00:22:29.424 --> 00:22:32.666]  Then I'll get you back on your old plan.
[00:22:32.666 --> 00:22:41.469]  And then, of course, he'll make the dictatorial changes, and then you won't get back on your own plan, and you won't get free health care, because that was never the intention, but it won't matter.
[00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:45.071]  Then he'll say, oh, my gosh, I'm going to have to go in and even take more of your rights.
[00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:51.674]  And it was written by the foreign insurance companies that are owned by big multinational offshore banks on record.
[00:22:55.034 --> 00:22:58.257]  To absolutely eviscerate and suck this country dry.
[00:22:58.257 --> 00:23:06.984]  And it's so frustrating to sit there and warn people about the legislation when they were trying to pass it four years ago.
[00:23:06.984 --> 00:23:10.887]  Implemented now this year, in just the last two months.
[00:23:10.887 --> 00:23:13.409]  And to have folks go, well you're just racist.
[00:23:13.409 --> 00:23:16.251]  Remember the talking point on CNN and MSNBC?
[00:23:16.251 --> 00:23:17.772]  We played the clips there many times.
[00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:18.633]  It's racist.
[00:23:18.633 --> 00:23:20.535]  People don't like Obamacare because he's black.
[00:23:21.445 --> 00:23:30.331]  Listen, if he had blue skin and was a constitutional patriot from another planet, I would be happy to have an alien for president.
[00:23:30.331 --> 00:23:33.813]  If the alien wasn't a tyrant, okay?
[00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:34.674]  I mean, I'm serious.
[00:23:36.505 --> 00:23:43.632]  It is the people pushing all this race business who are the ones keeping it alive, stirring it up, and I know that's clear to most people.
[00:23:43.632 --> 00:23:47.515]  But when you get attacked all day for being racist, it starts making you racist.
[00:23:47.515 --> 00:23:53.120]  It starts making you not like the groups that use it as a weapon against you.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.544]  Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:23:59.281 --> 00:24:07.790]  It'd be like if your wife was constantly accusing you, I've read about the phenomenon, of cheating on her, or your husband, vice versa, is accusing you.
[00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.672]  You'll go out and do it.
[00:24:09.672 --> 00:24:10.533]  It's like the girlfriend.
[00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:13.736]  If you say, I think you're cheating on me, I think you're going to leave me, I don't think you like me.
[00:24:13.736 --> 00:24:15.738]  Well, they'll just go ahead and leave you.
[00:24:15.738 --> 00:24:19.802]  And it's just, but I'm sophisticated enough to understand what's going on.
[00:24:19.802 --> 00:24:21.284]  I think you're sophisticated enough.
[00:24:22.591 --> 00:24:29.434]  To understand what's happening here, to understand the different pieces of the puzzle, but we've got serious issues worldwide.
[00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:45.841]  A designed global depression to bring us into a collectivist technocracy run by offshore corporations that are above the law and have diplomatic immunity, engineering the economy to totally take over as a weaponized system, an economic weaponized system.
[00:24:47.082 --> 00:24:47.983]  Agenda 21.
[00:24:47.983 --> 00:24:49.244]  It's all on record.
[00:24:49.244 --> 00:25:01.976]  And we're sitting here, while the ship's sinking, and the establishment is up there with a bullhorn, wanting the ship to sink, saying, anybody that tries to keep the ship afloat is a racist.
[00:25:01.976 --> 00:25:03.217]  You don't want to turn your guns in?
[00:25:03.217 --> 00:25:04.639]  You're a racist.
[00:25:04.639 --> 00:25:06.280]  The NRA is the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.724]  We hear that talking point constantly.
[00:25:09.724 --> 00:25:11.886]  Over and over
[00:25:13.283 --> 00:25:14.323]  And over again.
[00:25:14.323 --> 00:25:17.145]  Do I need to play the clips here for you?
[00:25:17.145 --> 00:25:21.406]  That's an official talking point.
[00:25:21.406 --> 00:25:29.730]  And it doesn't matter if the NRA was founded to arm black people so they could fight the Ku Klux Klan in the South and the North.
[00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.431]  Facts don't matter!
[00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:40.994]  Doesn't matter if the places where they've taken the guns are mainly black cities so that only the criminals can reign as a tool of social control.
[00:25:40.994 --> 00:25:42.195]  Doesn't matter that the real
[00:25:43.485 --> 00:25:53.908]  Social engineering, it's beyond racism, has been tested out on black communities to great effect, and is now being used everywhere against everybody, and we're all in this together.
[00:25:53.908 --> 00:25:59.509]  It doesn't matter if we're on the edge of what could become World War III with Iran and Saudi Arabia.
[00:25:59.509 --> 00:26:03.350]  Both groups with nuclear weapons, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:10.152]  That's why, again, I was told by two high-level sources, and then I was talking to a special warfare person,
[00:26:14.164 --> 00:26:23.682]  Who I'm related to, and I told them this the last time and they got very upset and they said, I don't know how you know this type of stuff, but do not talk to me about this type of stuff.
[00:26:33.336 --> 00:26:43.620]  You know, this isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen, and I know most of you know that, but for people that don't like me out there, or who think I'm making this stuff up, I wish you were right.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:48.842]  I wish you were correct about me.
[00:26:48.842 --> 00:26:49.982]  In fact, I figured something out.
[00:26:49.982 --> 00:26:55.365]  I've been more self-destructive lately, on-air and off-air, and I've psychoanalyzed it.
[00:26:55.365 --> 00:26:58.266]  Just today, I had the understanding.
[00:26:58.266 --> 00:27:00.847]  It's because I want to discredit myself
[00:27:01.843 --> 00:27:05.186]  Because I don't want to be right.
[00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:12.052]  It's one thing that people attack me because the government hacks or operatives and are putting out disinfo because they know I'm telling the truth.
[00:27:12.052 --> 00:27:18.057]  But when people criticize me for all the crazy things I do sometimes on air, hey listen, I didn't cause all these problems.
[00:27:18.057 --> 00:27:20.639]  I'm just a regular guy who didn't want to be a slave.
[00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:27.785]  And believe me, I don't blame you, those of you out there that attack me from a position of being scared and upset and not wanting it to be true.
[00:27:27.785 --> 00:27:30.047]  Man, I get everything you're saying.
[00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:45.506]  At a sophisticated level, I want to not believe this, because you say, I don't want to believe my lying eyes, I don't want to believe my lying intellect.
[00:27:45.506 --> 00:27:55.348]  Even though I know I'm right, reality is so dangerous and so crazy that
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.928]  That I have been sabotaging myself in little ways.
[00:28:00.928 --> 00:28:02.491]  We all do it.
[00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:05.859]  Because it's almost like my brain sees it at a subconscious level.
[00:28:07.088 --> 00:28:12.410]  As if, you know, my understanding of this, because at a primitive level, people believe whatever they think is reality.
[00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.391]  That's not the case.
[00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:15.972]  Reality is what you've scientifically observed and proven.
[00:28:15.972 --> 00:28:22.015]  And my scientific area of my brain, we're all the same, we all have that, knows it's real, knows it's happening.
[00:28:22.015 --> 00:28:31.659]  And then my other side, the more emotional, art-centered side, that, you know, that is magical, you know, thinking centers in it, and by magical thinking I mean delusional,
[00:28:33.616 --> 00:28:41.840]  It is mad at the other side of my scientific cortex, and it's saying, no, you're bad, you're bad, you're bad.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.561]  So listen, I fully get it.
[00:28:44.561 --> 00:28:47.182]  I fully get why folks don't want to believe me.
[00:28:47.182 --> 00:28:55.365]  Because if I'm right, which I am, we're living in the middle of a science fiction movie, and it only goes from bad to worse.
[00:28:55.365 --> 00:28:56.446]  We'll be right back with the big news.
[00:28:56.446 --> 00:28:56.766]  Stay with us.
[00:29:01.044 --> 00:29:06.506]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:29:06.506 --> 00:29:15.388]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:29:15.388 --> 00:29:23.211]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:29:23.211 --> 00:29:30.613]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:29:31.113 --> 00:29:35.075]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:29:35.075 --> 00:29:39.258]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[00:29:53.626 --> 00:29:57.669]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.642]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[00:30:03.642 --> 00:30:09.586]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:30:09.586 --> 00:30:16.171]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:30:16.171 --> 00:30:21.874]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:30:21.874 --> 00:30:25.517]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:29.500]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:34.105]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[00:30:34.105 --> 00:30:36.607]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[00:30:36.607 --> 00:30:40.450]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.895]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[00:30:44.895 --> 00:30:47.537]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:30:47.837 --> 00:30:54.666]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:58.931]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com.
[00:31:00.541 --> 00:31:01.621]  I had tried everything.
[00:31:01.621 --> 00:31:03.962]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:07.103]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:31:07.103 --> 00:31:11.924]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:31:11.924 --> 00:31:18.306]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:31:18.786 --> 00:31:30.015]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:30.015 --> 00:31:34.479]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:31:34.479 --> 00:31:40.744]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:40.744 --> 00:31:41.885]  Now that's results!
[00:31:42.285 --> 00:31:54.815]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:31:59.887 --> 00:32:05.695]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:32:05.695 --> 00:32:13.084]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:32:13.084 --> 00:32:16.248]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:32:16.408 --> 00:32:18.449]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:32:18.449 --> 00:32:23.112]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:32:23.112 --> 00:32:26.014]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:32:26.014 --> 00:32:31.978]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:32:31.978 --> 00:32:35.660]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:40.903]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:32:40.903 --> 00:32:43.885]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:50.108]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:32:50.108 --> 00:32:52.269]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:33:01.353 --> 00:33:02.894]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:02.894 --> 00:33:04.935]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.935 --> 00:33:08.136]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:15.663 --> 00:33:21.686]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:21.686 --> 00:33:26.728]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:26.728 --> 00:33:40.995]  I want to get back into the latest on Obamacare, the terrible tornadoes up in Chicago area, Indianapolis facing significant tornado threat.
[00:33:40.995 --> 00:33:42.696]  Of course, Washington, Illinois hit.
[00:33:42.696 --> 00:33:43.536]  A lot of folks injured.
[00:33:43.536 --> 00:33:44.677]  I want to pray for those folks up there.
[00:33:45.967 --> 00:33:48.589]  But mainstream media's got that covered.
[00:33:48.589 --> 00:33:52.392]  Al Gore, of course, will say that that's proof that we need carbon taxes because of tornadoes.
[00:33:52.392 --> 00:33:53.513]  There's always been tornadoes.
[00:33:53.513 --> 00:33:57.075]  We're actually at a 60-year low of tornadoes, according to NOAA.
[00:33:58.381 --> 00:34:06.828]  The National Weather Service, according to USA Today, you can pull that up, we are at a 60-year low as of the last decade.
[00:34:06.828 --> 00:34:14.474]  And this year is the peak of the low, the lowest ever recorded since the National Weather Service was able to record this.
[00:34:14.474 --> 00:34:16.436]  And that's with even better Doppler radar, you name it.
[00:34:16.436 --> 00:34:17.977]  So I've already covered that.
[00:34:17.977 --> 00:34:20.299]  We have larger population, you name it.
[00:34:20.299 --> 00:34:24.002]  But Al Gore, undoubtedly you watch, he's not on TV yet, but he will be by tomorrow.
[00:34:24.997 --> 00:34:33.821]  And Alec Baldwin and all the rest of them will say, see, it's man-made, we did this, it's our fault.
[00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:45.146]  And it is absolute, total, and complete fraud, but just tornadoes all over northern Indiana, all over Illinois, and into Ohio.
[00:34:45.146 --> 00:34:47.006]  So again, pray for those folks there.
[00:34:47.006 --> 00:34:50.448]  That's why the old-timers built storm cellars.
[00:34:50.448 --> 00:34:51.989]  That's why the Wizard of Oz written 100 years ago.
[00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:54.019]  No.
[00:35:11.906 --> 00:35:17.929]  With ruby red slippers, gone forward into the future, paid Al Gore money, and then there wouldn't have been a tornado.
[00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:19.350]  Alright, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.812]  But like, getting back to what I was saying about people being delusional, I want to be delusional.
[00:35:23.812 --> 00:35:29.475]  I want to live in the fairytale land where Santa Claus is real, and Obamacare is a good deal, and Obama cares about me.
[00:35:29.986 --> 00:35:32.508]  I want to live in the fantasy land.
[00:35:32.508 --> 00:35:34.610]  I maybe 10% bought into Obama.
[00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.690]  I was very critical of him.
[00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.752]  I said him or McCain will both be bad.
[00:35:37.752 --> 00:35:40.154]  World Net Daily even came out and wrote a book.
[00:35:40.154 --> 00:35:43.116]  Joseph Farah saying none of the above.
[00:35:43.116 --> 00:35:46.519]  And maybe this will help even though we don't like Obama.
[00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:48.040]  We know he's a gun grabber.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.763]  Maybe he could be like a black Ronald Reagan and bring America together.
[00:35:52.763 --> 00:35:54.945]  Wouldn't it be good to have racial unity?
[00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:58.588]  Man, day one he gets in starts the racial division.
[00:36:00.236 --> 00:36:03.477]  And it's not just racial division.
[00:36:03.477 --> 00:36:23.024]  They are demonizing, demonizing, at just a huge level, the free market and entrepreneurs and people that go out and hire folks and invest and put themselves out there with the liability and the government and the employees that make stuff up.
[00:36:24.335 --> 00:36:26.077]  I've finally got a good crew here.
[00:36:26.077 --> 00:36:29.700]  But you know, anybody that's run operations, a lot of people, you know what it's like.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.724]  I mean, in this country and other countries, it's gotten amazing.
[00:36:34.724 --> 00:36:36.966]  The sense of entitlement by so-called labor.
[00:36:40.455 --> 00:36:58.081]  You know, Paul DeGioia of Paul Mitchell, his partner's last name's Mitchell, is an American icon making tens of billions of dollars over the years with entrepreneurial products and literally transforming cosmetics and shampoo and all the rest of it.
[00:36:58.081 --> 00:37:07.804]  And I think it was about a year ago, I read an article by him in Forbes magazine, or he was being interviewed in Forbes, but it was a piece of a speech and some other stuff, kind of a profile, if memory serves.
[00:37:08.783 --> 00:37:17.288]  And he said, look, I wanted to believe in Obama, but I'm in business and I'm just going to lay off a bunch of people and it's going to hurt everybody in the economy.
[00:37:17.288 --> 00:37:21.930]  And this Obamacare, we've read it, and it's going to get rid of a bunch of jobs.
[00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.191]  Everybody's going to go to part time.
[00:37:23.191 --> 00:37:24.792]  And I want to be in America.
[00:37:24.792 --> 00:37:26.333]  I want to hire in America.
[00:37:26.333 --> 00:37:28.154]  But this thing is written.
[00:37:28.154 --> 00:37:35.338]  This is a guy that literally created himself from being homeless folks to having one of the most successful companies in the world.
[00:37:35.338 --> 00:37:37.279]  That's the type of rich guy I admire.
[00:37:38.188 --> 00:37:43.814]  He literally made it all himself with his tenacity.
[00:37:43.814 --> 00:37:49.761]  There it is, business tips from once homeless billionaire John Paul DeGioia.
[00:37:49.761 --> 00:37:58.571]  And I haven't said a lot about this over the years, and I'm not going to say a ton about it, but I admired him admiring the free market system.
[00:38:01.036 --> 00:38:03.238]  And of course he's in Austin tonight as well.
[00:38:03.238 --> 00:38:04.399]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:38:04.399 --> 00:38:22.591]  But last night I was invited out to a private party that he was hosting with his son-in-law, Jesse James, and his race car driver daughter, Alexis James.
[00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:27.795]  And it was just such Americana to hear him give his little speech that I videotaped.
[00:38:27.795 --> 00:38:29.016]  I'll probably air it sometime this week.
[00:38:31.224 --> 00:38:38.386]  The new products that Jesse James is rolling out, and I've actually known Jesse James for a long time, never really talked about that on air.
[00:38:38.386 --> 00:38:41.347]  He's a listener and retweets my stuff.
[00:38:41.347 --> 00:38:42.227]  I wasn't even aware of that.
[00:38:42.227 --> 00:38:46.828]  I'm always so busy pointing it out.
[00:38:46.828 --> 00:38:49.129]  And of course, he can be demonized for cheating on his wife or whatever.
[00:38:49.129 --> 00:38:50.169]  Nobody's perfect.
[00:38:50.169 --> 00:38:57.411]  The point is, though, they're entrepreneurs, and these are the type of people that innovate and that have made this country great.
[00:38:59.205 --> 00:39:05.948]  And that's what it's all about, is American pride and built in America.
[00:39:05.948 --> 00:39:09.810]  And you can say whatever you want about America, but our exceptionalism
[00:39:11.741 --> 00:39:15.424]  Our exceptionalism was a reality.
[00:39:15.424 --> 00:39:33.577]  We had the highest IQs, physically the smartest, the most patents, known as being trailblazers, known as being as tough as it gets in a fight, known as being smart, crafty, not stupid, not a pushover, known for beating empires that nobody had ever beaten in history, like the British Empire that was beating people like Napoleon.
[00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:46.493]  Then there's just this demonization of anybody having a company, anybody being successful.
[00:39:46.493 --> 00:39:54.497]  And I was sitting there, though, seeing victory in Jesse James's new, Jesse James Firearms company coming out.
[00:39:55.197 --> 00:39:58.300]  That I'm told is already back ordered two years.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:05.866]  But the point is, and I know guns folks, there was a lot of special forces, retired people, and the NRA nationally was there last night.
[00:40:05.866 --> 00:40:11.651]  There's only about 200 people at the party, but it was all like basically who's who of guns.
[00:40:11.651 --> 00:40:15.794]  And to see the 1911 .45s they're coming out with, and to see the
[00:40:20.762 --> 00:40:28.824]  Piston-driven M4s that I would liken to a 223 Reaper style in the 308.
[00:40:28.824 --> 00:40:31.905]  And just to see that's victory over tyrants.
[00:40:31.905 --> 00:40:45.828]  If we can make guns cool, make defending ourselves cool, make the ideals of 1776 cool again, then we can literally, quite literally,
[00:40:46.854 --> 00:40:48.135]  We're good to go.
[00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:06.471]  People say, oh, that Second Amendment nut.
[00:41:06.471 --> 00:41:06.871]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:41:06.871 --> 00:41:08.791]  If they get rid of that, they get rid of everything else.
[00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:11.252]  And you notice they are getting rid of everything else right now.
[00:41:11.252 --> 00:41:15.874]  Obama is saying he'll control Obamacare now by executive orders outside of Congress.
[00:41:15.874 --> 00:41:18.615]  Even mainstream news is calling that dictatorial.
[00:41:18.615 --> 00:41:23.016]  He's saying he'll shut down all our coal power plants without congressional approval.
[00:41:23.016 --> 00:41:24.557]  That's called dictatorial.
[00:41:24.557 --> 00:41:25.457]  Hence the word dictator.
[00:41:27.332 --> 00:41:30.793]  Dictatorial then translates to an individual as dictator.
[00:41:30.793 --> 00:41:32.593]  That's the very definition of it.
[00:41:32.593 --> 00:41:34.774]  He's saying he'll do everything and anything he wants.
[00:41:34.774 --> 00:41:36.134]  He's going to legalize the illegals.
[00:41:36.134 --> 00:41:37.515]  Already basically has by fiat.
[00:41:37.515 --> 00:41:39.335]  I've got articles on that in the stack.
[00:41:39.335 --> 00:41:46.037]  By just not even having orders, just saying to his bureaucrats do it.
[00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:56.600]  And it'd be fine to have all these immigrants here if they weren't being given free welfare and in-state tuition in most states when they show up as a corporate
[00:41:57.859 --> 00:42:03.987]  Indulgence as a corporate subsidy to drive down wages so they can work for stuff that nobody can live on.
[00:42:03.987 --> 00:42:11.317]  And then get on the welfare goals to be democratic, anti-gun, anti-free market voters.
[00:42:11.317 --> 00:42:13.861]  I mean, this is a takeover that's happening right now.
[00:42:15.242 --> 00:42:21.687]  So, my whole point is that, you know, I personally, and I've already trademarked it and everything else, never got around to doing it.
[00:42:21.687 --> 00:42:25.629]  I didn't do it because of liability, and my main mission is not to make money.
[00:42:25.629 --> 00:42:32.494]  It is to get the word out, so I didn't do it, but we already have deals lined up to come out with 1776.
[00:42:32.494 --> 00:42:34.896]  Made in 1776 is the name of the brand.
[00:42:34.896 --> 00:42:35.857]  Firearms.
[00:42:35.857 --> 00:42:37.518]  Can you imagine firearms called Made in 1776?
[00:42:40.054 --> 00:42:44.859]  That's what they saw, but this country was made in 1776, and it was made when they came to take the guns.
[00:42:44.859 --> 00:42:58.312]  This country was made in 1776, so it's just good to see other people doing that, because I realize that guns, just the symbol of the slave being armed, transmutes you into not being a slave, and the system knows that.
[00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:06.540]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:15.422]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:43:15.422 --> 00:43:23.265]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:43:23.265 --> 00:43:30.647]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:43:31.167 --> 00:43:35.110]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:39.313]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[00:44:05.715 --> 00:44:10.238]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:44:10.238 --> 00:44:16.362]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:44:16.362 --> 00:44:27.150]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:33.832]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:44:33.832 --> 00:44:48.555]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:44:48.775 --> 00:44:51.537]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.

[00:45:21.684 --> 00:45:25.329]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.

[00:45:40.285 --> 00:45:43.128]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[00:45:43.789 --> 00:45:44.690]  By Rosa Kory.
[00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.654]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:45:47.654 --> 00:45:48.936]  The Greater Good.
[00:45:48.936 --> 00:45:54.483]  The most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:45:54.483 --> 00:45:58.749]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com
[00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:04.514]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:46:04.514 --> 00:46:07.637]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:46:07.637 --> 00:46:13.182]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:46:13.182 --> 00:46:14.803]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:46:15.123 --> 00:46:16.764]  We are what we eat.
[00:46:16.764 --> 00:46:21.427]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:46:21.427 --> 00:46:25.649]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:28.211]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:46:28.211 --> 00:46:34.434]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:47:02.895 --> 00:47:04.957]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.957 --> 00:47:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:13.815 --> 00:47:15.677]  We are on the march.
[00:47:15.677 --> 00:47:18.840]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:28.528]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:28.528 --> 00:47:40.479]  You see, I admire people that trailblaze and come from nothing and build wealth and build institutions and hire people and make society better.
[00:47:41.553 --> 00:47:53.117]  If you look at historically at what happens in socialist and communist and command-and-control countries, there's one type of bread, there's one type of sausage, there's one type of shampoo, there's one type of razors.
[00:47:53.117 --> 00:47:55.858]  They can charge you whatever they want for it.
[00:47:55.858 --> 00:48:00.299]  There's always a tiny super-rich elite who are exempt from all the laws.
[00:48:00.299 --> 00:48:01.660]  Look at France right now.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.501]  The Socialist Party has a 100% tax on the middle class and the rich.
[00:48:05.501 --> 00:48:07.162]  But the insiders are all exempt.
[00:48:07.162 --> 00:48:08.782]  You go, well how come you're 100%?
[00:48:08.782 --> 00:48:10.903]  It's meant to destroy their competition.
[00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:15.401]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:48:15.401 --> 00:48:19.384]  That maxim is from the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[00:48:19.384 --> 00:48:20.745]  Look it up.
[00:48:20.745 --> 00:48:26.429]  And so we're being destroyed by this regulation, by the selective enforcement.
[00:48:26.429 --> 00:48:36.836]  And the establishment sits up there, and the establishment sits back and plays us all off against each other.
[00:48:36.836 --> 00:48:39.497]  You know, there's the Forbes headline, French tax sores over 100%.
[00:48:41.957 --> 00:48:43.639]  But the Socialist Party's exempt.
[00:48:43.639 --> 00:48:47.002]  And now the poor people are rioting all over France because the gas tax.
[00:48:47.002 --> 00:48:49.725]  They just put a carbon tax in two weeks ago.
[00:48:49.725 --> 00:48:51.186]  And that's the same model.
[00:48:51.186 --> 00:48:58.553]  Obama hired the top French socialist economist to come over here and quote, run our economy.
[00:48:58.553 --> 00:48:59.734]  He did that last year.
[00:48:59.734 --> 00:49:02.537]  I mean, you cannot make this stuff up.
[00:49:02.537 --> 00:49:06.221]  And then you've got criticism of the rich that made their money.
[00:49:07.526 --> 00:49:10.729]  And who actually try to build infrastructure.
[00:49:10.729 --> 00:49:21.958]  And then you've got the ultra-rich, who are insiders on record, who just print and control the money, control the stocks, control the bonds, make their money through fraud, drug dealing, money laundering, you name it.
[00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:25.761]  They want insider mafia deals to shut down their competition.
[00:49:25.761 --> 00:49:28.143]  And that's the essence of this.
[00:49:28.143 --> 00:49:29.704]  Now there it is, France 24.
[00:49:29.704 --> 00:49:32.866]  Renowned French economist has joined Obama's team.
[00:49:32.866 --> 00:49:33.987]  How do you pronounce her?
[00:49:33.987 --> 00:49:35.248]  Esther Duflo?
[00:49:36.266 --> 00:49:36.846]  Duflo.
[00:49:36.846 --> 00:49:40.628]  I mean, he looks like a five-year-old boy.
[00:49:40.628 --> 00:49:45.691]  Anyways, another thing is these socialists usually can't even hardly talk.
[00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:47.392]  They just walk around about how smart they are all day.
[00:49:47.392 --> 00:49:49.273]  Makes me want to throw up.
[00:49:49.273 --> 00:49:56.636]  The amount of liberty, the amount of diversity in products and in choices and culture that America has produced.
[00:49:56.636 --> 00:49:59.398]  How did 4% of the world's population end up with half the wealth?
[00:50:01.596 --> 00:50:02.496]  You'll say stealing it.
[00:50:02.496 --> 00:50:03.597]  No, no, we had that by the 50s.
[00:50:03.597 --> 00:50:08.700]  It was when we started stealing the wealth that we lost it individually.
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.981]  Did you get lower gas prices by stealing the Iraqi oil?
[00:50:10.981 --> 00:50:12.082]  No.
[00:50:12.082 --> 00:50:16.764]  They were actually mad at Saddam for over-pumping oil to pay off his debts.
[00:50:16.764 --> 00:50:19.346]  That's why they basically invaded him in 1991.
[00:50:19.346 --> 00:50:26.950]  They told him, listen, you can go ahead and invade Kuwait, just don't over-pump the oil anymore.
[00:50:28.151 --> 00:50:30.352]  And he said, really, because they've been stealing my oil, slant drilling.
[00:50:30.352 --> 00:50:33.152]  And they said, hey, we supported you with Iran.
[00:50:33.152 --> 00:50:34.012]  Do what you got to do.
[00:50:34.012 --> 00:50:34.833]  And he went, really?
[00:50:34.833 --> 00:50:39.774]  He's a CIA-trained, high-level CIA agent.
[00:50:39.774 --> 00:50:40.794]  That's all declassified.
[00:50:40.794 --> 00:50:42.414]  Look it up.
[00:50:42.414 --> 00:50:45.115]  From the time he was 20 years old, trained by the CIA in Egypt.
[00:50:45.115 --> 00:50:48.416]  And he thought, so I'm being given the orders again.
[00:50:49.332 --> 00:50:51.313]  And then he didn't trust him, so he asked the U.S.
[00:50:51.313 --> 00:50:55.175]  Ambassador April Gillespie on Iraqi television.
[00:50:55.175 --> 00:51:03.118]  He said, so, I'm going to attack Kuwait if they don't stop stealing my oil, and then I can pay off the debt to America, 30 billion that I've left.
[00:51:03.118 --> 00:51:05.699]  He goes, will you be upset about that?
[00:51:05.699 --> 00:51:12.182]  She says, Your Excellency, as you know, we do not get involved in inner Arab affairs.
[00:51:12.182 --> 00:51:13.443]  Your Excellency.
[00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:17.451]  I'm not a fan of Saddam Hussein.
[00:51:17.451 --> 00:51:20.972]  The point is, is the guy was set up and his country was set up.
[00:51:20.972 --> 00:51:22.513]  Women were going to college.
[00:51:22.513 --> 00:51:24.133]  They weren't wearing burqas.
[00:51:24.133 --> 00:51:28.795]  You could go see R-rated movies there and listen to rock and roll on the radio.
[00:51:28.795 --> 00:51:36.737]  Now, they're putting women in burqas, they're not going to college, and the jihadis have taken over Iraq and our government helped put them in power.
[00:51:36.737 --> 00:51:41.799]  Just like they are in Egypt, just like they're trying to do in Syria, just like they've done in Libya.
[00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:44.842]  And you know, I digress.
[00:51:44.842 --> 00:51:55.152]  It's just that I watch the people that run our country and run other countries just wrecking anybody that has anything they don't control.
[00:51:55.152 --> 00:51:56.794]  And then I know how economics work.
[00:51:56.794 --> 00:51:57.194]  I know how
[00:51:58.274 --> 00:52:15.931]  I mean, I, by myself, have come from nowhere, on the radio, with no money, just with research and history, to reach 15 million people a week and have my own multi-pronged media operation that even mainline trade publications say are the model of building your own media system.
[00:52:16.909 --> 00:52:22.214]  And so I admire people who've built their own thing, and I know that's the answer.
[00:52:22.214 --> 00:52:24.415]  That's the true diversity in the economy.
[00:52:24.415 --> 00:52:25.897]  That's the true free market.
[00:52:25.897 --> 00:52:26.978]  That is what works.
[00:52:26.978 --> 00:52:38.447]  And they demonize the free market, blaming the free market for the crony insider monopoly market that we've allowed insider groups to create.
[00:52:38.447 --> 00:52:40.549]  This isn't free market that did all this.
[00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:42.311]  NAFTA and GATT isn't free trade.
[00:52:42.311 --> 00:52:43.372]  It's insider deals.
[00:52:44.926 --> 00:52:59.001]  And then I see Oprah Winfrey, with all the problems we face, with Obama caught lying to us on every front, from won't hire lobbyists, shut down Guantanamo Bay, won't have executive orders, won't have signing statements, on and on and on.
[00:52:59.001 --> 00:53:01.123]  He didn't just lie, he broke the records!
[00:53:02.452 --> 00:53:03.592]  By light years.
[00:53:03.592 --> 00:53:05.933]  I mean, it's just such betrayal.
[00:53:05.933 --> 00:53:08.114]  My mouth is hanging open, folks.
[00:53:08.114 --> 00:53:09.374]  I can't believe it.
[00:53:09.374 --> 00:53:12.255]  Obamacare, all of it, pure lies.
[00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:15.215]  And then she says in a BBC interview, I want to play like a three-minute clip of it here.
[00:53:15.215 --> 00:53:16.876]  I'm going to talk over it.
[00:53:16.876 --> 00:53:21.897]  She's talking to the most pencil-necked, politically correct operative I've ever seen.
[00:53:21.897 --> 00:53:24.098]  She talks to him like he's a dog and pats him on the head.
[00:53:24.098 --> 00:53:29.079]  And goes, good job, you know, to him, you little little worm.
[00:53:29.079 --> 00:53:31.600]  And then she says, we need everybody to die.
[00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:43.212]  Who's basically, uh, you know, until we all die, you know, there won't be an end to racism, blah, blah, blah, when the media is always injecting more of it as divide and conquer.
[00:53:43.212 --> 00:53:47.933]  And then meanwhile, the Redskins team bus has been egged on what a stadium in Philly.
[00:53:47.933 --> 00:53:49.693]  And again, maybe they should change the name of the Redskins.
[00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:51.274]  Maybe this is insensitive to somebody.
[00:53:51.274 --> 00:53:57.595]  The point is, next though, they're saying don't be an Indian on Halloween, because that's insensitive, or don't be a geisha girl or a cowboy.
[00:53:59.178 --> 00:54:01.899]  See, it's political tyranny, folks.
[00:54:01.899 --> 00:54:16.883]  While we're all being robbed by foreign banks, while we're all having our dollar devalued, while we're having our energy system cut off, while we're being impoverished in a plan to collectivize the nation on record, Cloward and Piven, agenda 21, on record, it's all happening.
[00:54:16.883 --> 00:54:20.984]  And then meanwhile, you're racist if you don't do whatever Obama says.
[00:54:20.984 --> 00:54:25.665]  And then she goes on to say, people criticize him because they're racist.
[00:54:25.665 --> 00:54:25.885]  No.
[00:54:27.674 --> 00:54:33.238]  I would love, if it was a black Ron Paul, I'd shine his shoes.
[00:54:33.238 --> 00:54:36.920]  I could care less what color the melanin is in somebody's skin.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.481]  Believe me.
[00:54:38.481 --> 00:54:40.002]  And I shouldn't have to sit there and explain that.
[00:54:40.002 --> 00:54:41.123]  It's so frustrating.
[00:54:41.123 --> 00:54:43.665]  I mean, Oprah Winfrey is such a race baiter and she knows what she's doing.
[00:54:43.665 --> 00:54:46.487]  She goes to globalist eugenicist meetings with David Rockefeller.
[00:54:46.487 --> 00:54:50.589]  It's come out in the Times of London where they talk about forcibly reducing Africa's population.
[00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:55.032]  I mean, she is just an elitist pig.
[00:54:55.032 --> 00:54:57.054]  She is the ultimate piece of scum.
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.761]  Let's play part of this Up for Winfrey Club.
[00:55:00.761 --> 00:55:01.481]  Here it is.
[00:55:01.481 --> 00:55:07.084]  The issue of the civil rights movement and the way that black people around the world... Look at this fake intellectual.
[00:55:07.084 --> 00:55:07.704]  Around the world.
[00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:08.264]  Around the world.
[00:55:10.968 --> 00:55:13.990]  Look at, you know, places like Russia, it's, you know, it's... Around the world.
[00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:30.137]  So, is this, is this a, I suppose, from a movie point of view, from what you, what, what, what the movie and the messages within the movie hold, and, and the other movies we were discussing, and Scotch Broys, are the, are these historical comments, or are we... The guy's not comfortable around her.
[00:55:30.137 --> 00:55:32.098]  Good question.
[00:55:32.098 --> 00:55:33.019]  Well phrased.
[00:55:33.019 --> 00:55:33.899]  Well phrased.
[00:55:33.899 --> 00:55:34.720]  Good job.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.740]  Good job, you idiot.
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:39.362]  Um... It would be foolish
[00:55:41.144 --> 00:56:03.645]  To not recognize that we have evolved and that we're not still facing the same kind of terrorism against black people en masse as was displayed with the Scottsboro Boys.
[00:56:03.645 --> 00:56:04.426]  It's gotten better.
[00:56:05.922 --> 00:56:10.388]  Are there still places where people are terrorized because of the color of their skin?
[00:56:10.388 --> 00:56:16.457]  Okay, so there's kind of a more reasonable intro type deal, but then here's the two zingers.
[00:56:16.457 --> 00:56:21.223]  Here she is saying, the people that are racist, and she's going to define that.
[00:56:21.223 --> 00:56:22.605]  Remember, owning guns is not racist.
[00:56:23.607 --> 00:56:25.349]  Owning guns is now racist.
[00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:28.572]  So she's saying this is what needs to happen when they label you as a racist.
[00:56:28.572 --> 00:56:29.513]  Here it is.
[00:56:29.513 --> 00:56:36.020]  There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it.
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.302]  In that prejudice and racism.
[00:56:38.302 --> 00:56:41.185]  And they just have to die.
[00:56:41.185 --> 00:56:43.027]  Just the level of disrespect.
[00:56:44.133 --> 00:56:47.115]  When the senator yelled out, you're a liar.
[00:56:47.115 --> 00:56:47.736]  Remember that?
[00:56:47.736 --> 00:56:49.757]  He is a liar!
[00:56:49.757 --> 00:56:55.361]  Yeah, I think there's a level of disrespect for the office that occurs.
[00:56:55.361 --> 00:57:02.987]  And that occurs in some cases and maybe even many cases because he's African-American.
[00:57:03.979 --> 00:57:14.988]  No, Obama was given more respect and allowed to do more because people are so politically correct and wanted to believe in him and wanted to seal the breach and have people get along with each other.
[00:57:14.988 --> 00:57:25.336]  And you used the majority of white people that voted for Barack Obama the first go-round and the second go-round, you used their goodwill to hoodwink this country.
[00:57:26.181 --> 00:57:32.624]  And to play black off against white and sell racism in division at the same time claiming you're fighting it.
[00:57:32.624 --> 00:57:34.785]  This is divide and conquer balkanization.
[00:57:34.785 --> 00:57:39.067]  Does Oprah ever talk about black tribes killing each other in Africa and the UN funding both sides?
[00:57:39.067 --> 00:57:42.248]  Does she ever talk about Muslims against each other with the globalist funding that?
[00:57:42.248 --> 00:57:42.768]  No.
[00:57:42.768 --> 00:57:47.570]  The only evil in the world is white people that don't turn their guns in and become communists.
[00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:49.131]  So billionaires like her can suck off of us.
[00:57:50.956 --> 00:57:57.600]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.062]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:58:00.062 --> 00:58:00.422]  The U.S.
[00:58:00.422 --> 00:58:04.665]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:58:04.665 --> 00:58:07.627]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:58:07.627 --> 00:58:09.108]  They want that attack to come.
[00:58:09.108 --> 00:58:15.312]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.362]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:58:18.362 --> 00:58:23.327]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:58:23.327 --> 00:58:30.753]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:58:31.073 --> 00:58:33.835]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:58:33.835 --> 00:58:36.917]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:41.481]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[00:58:41.481 --> 00:58:46.084]  Available only at InfoWarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:58:49.994 --> 00:59:00.681]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:59:00.681 --> 00:59:02.743]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:59:02.743 --> 00:59:03.623]  Fluoride.
[00:59:03.623 --> 00:59:05.544]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:59:05.544 --> 00:59:12.129]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:59:12.129 --> 00:59:17.052]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:59:17.052 --> 00:59:19.754]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[00:59:20.074 --> 00:59:20.594]  We're good.
[00:59:53.536 --> 01:00:08.710]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:11.693]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.318 --> 01:00:38.302]  So basically we have government by games, government by insiders instead of government by consent, government by market, government by people's voting in government, voting with their dollars, voting with their purchases.
[01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:53.607]  That's the type of system that we're going into is one not based on the will of the people and the wisdom of the crowd, but a corrupt kleptocratic group trying to dumb down the crowd and create a false wisdom in the crowd to basically run off the edge of a cliff.
[01:00:54.619 --> 01:01:01.022]  Because people will follow the wisdom of the crowd instinctively.
[01:01:01.022 --> 01:01:07.544]  Because that's how they've been programmed to think.
[01:01:07.544 --> 01:01:10.666]  They will follow the wisdom of the crowd.
[01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:14.407]  Because throughout history, the wisdom of the crowd was generally good.
[01:01:14.407 --> 01:01:15.448]  Not always.
[01:01:15.448 --> 01:01:20.310]  Now it's been artificially created, and so people think they're following the wisdom of the crowd.
[01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.371]  Well, everybody else is drinking out of that water fountain.
[01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:22.991]  It must be okay.
[01:01:24.244 --> 01:01:26.425]  Even though it's really poison.
[01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:32.228]  Because as long as the poison kills you 5, 10, 15, 20 years later, nobody knows what killed them.
[01:01:32.228 --> 01:01:36.730]  And that's the essence of soft kill and killing people softly.
[01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:43.273]  By the way, every time I mention that now, I see comments on YouTube or Infowars going, why are you quoting a Brad Pitt movie?
[01:01:43.273 --> 01:01:45.274]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[01:01:45.274 --> 01:01:48.816]  Soft kill is in Pentagon papers going back to the seventies and eighties.
[01:01:50.854 --> 01:01:53.397]  Killing people softly.
[01:01:53.397 --> 01:01:54.558]  Killing them softly.
[01:01:54.558 --> 01:01:55.639]  Soft kill.
[01:01:55.639 --> 01:01:56.820]  Predates that.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:00.083]  That's one frustration I've got.
[01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:02.345]  Is that I don't plagiarize.
[01:02:02.345 --> 01:02:02.906]  On purpose.
[01:02:02.906 --> 01:02:05.869]  I mean, sometimes you forget where something came from and you just say it.
[01:02:05.869 --> 01:02:08.732]  But, I like to say where something came from.
[01:02:08.732 --> 01:02:11.034]  I like to give credit to where the knowledge came from.
[01:02:12.202 --> 01:02:19.004]  Or where the info came from, but I'm just sick of, like, people territorializing statements and comments.
[01:02:19.004 --> 01:02:25.466]  Instead of responding to what I said, they'll respond to, hey, that's the name of a Brad Pitt movie, what's that mean?
[01:02:25.466 --> 01:02:31.748]  No, it's not the name of a Brad Pitt movie, okay?
[01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:36.850]  So many times now, science fiction movies come out and have set in the future what's already going on.
[01:02:38.442 --> 01:03:06.129]  Like I was talking about face scanning to buy and sell, and how billboards are going to track you when you walk down the street 15 years ago, and then a few years later, Minority Report comes out, and people go, hey, you're ripping off Philip K. Dick, and I'm like, listen, I've read that book, that's not even really what's in the film by Steven Spielberg, but regardless, no, no, here's MIT, here's Stanford, here's
[01:03:08.397 --> 01:03:12.198]  All these different companies, all these different universities, planning this.
[01:03:12.198 --> 01:03:15.319]  But no, you got that in a movie, that's a movie, that's a movie, that's a movie.
[01:03:15.319 --> 01:03:17.140]  Oh, black helicopters, like in the movies.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.741]  And I'm like, no.
[01:03:18.741 --> 01:03:21.161]  Those are the movies copying what's really going on.
[01:03:21.161 --> 01:03:22.902]  It's just so frustrating.
[01:03:22.902 --> 01:03:24.883]  And I guess I'm waxing...
[01:03:27.836 --> 01:03:29.158]  Reflective here today.
[01:03:29.158 --> 01:03:30.400]  You know, I said I'd take your phone calls.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.983]  I want to take phone calls throughout this hour.
[01:03:32.983 --> 01:03:35.147]  The toll free number to join us first-time callers.
[01:03:35.147 --> 01:03:37.089]  So I want to hear from first-time callers.
[01:03:37.089 --> 01:03:38.732]  We do that three or four times a week.
[01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:43.538]  So all the new listeners have a chance to call in with their questions or comments or whatever wildcard point they want to bring up.
[01:03:45.373 --> 01:03:50.597]  But the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:03:50.597 --> 01:03:51.778]  877-789-2539.
[01:03:51.778 --> 01:03:54.141]  877-789-2539.
[01:03:54.141 --> 01:04:05.630]  It's different than the weekday number, because the weekday number is still run by Genesis, because I like the network and I like John Harmon I've had for 10 years up there answering the phones and running stuff with the satellite uplink.
[01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:10.855]  It was always like I was doing it as a remote, because I would do the radio show out of my house going back 16 years ago.
[01:04:12.358 --> 01:04:12.638]  I think so.
[01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:39.794]  That's where Genesis really trailblazed going back now 16, 17 years.
[01:04:39.794 --> 01:04:43.758]  Since 1997, I guess that's 16 years.
[01:04:43.758 --> 01:04:55.209]  Was that they would let people who were individuals but had talent do a show from their house or from their own studio and then dial into the network and go out on the satellite uplinks or they could produce it or you could produce it.
[01:04:55.709 --> 01:04:59.672]  So that's kind of why we have that weird system and do things different here because, well, we're a little different.
[01:04:59.672 --> 01:05:01.033]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:05:01.033 --> 01:05:04.676]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[01:05:04.676 --> 01:05:09.239]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:11.561]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride.
[01:05:11.781 --> 01:05:15.322]  And up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:05:15.322 --> 01:05:26.306]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:05:26.306 --> 01:05:29.167]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.
[01:05:29.167 --> 01:05:32.588]  We have a discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[01:05:32.808 --> 01:05:50.111]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia, and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:55.412]  Get your ProPure with the new Pro1 filter today at infoworkstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:06:05.433 --> 01:06:07.053]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:06:07.053 --> 01:06:14.275]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:06:14.275 --> 01:06:18.076]  Mao took the guns.
[01:06:18.076 --> 01:06:19.936]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:19.936 --> 01:06:21.436]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:06:36.456 --> 01:06:41.898]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:45.959]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:45.959 --> 01:06:54.382]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the world.
[01:06:58.516 --> 01:07:00.438]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:07:00.438 --> 01:07:14.531]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:19.616]  Liberty is rising!
[01:07:19.616 --> 01:07:21.657]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:07:22.967 --> 01:07:26.250]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.492]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:07:28.492 --> 01:07:29.713]  Toll-free number to join us.
[01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.735]  We're opening the phones up for first-time callers on this Sunday edition.
[01:07:32.735 --> 01:07:33.336]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:07:33.336 --> 01:07:33.476]  877-789-2539.
[01:07:33.476 --> 01:07:36.959]  And we'll get you up and on the air on any subject you want to talk about.
[01:07:43.834 --> 01:07:56.887]  But again, it's government by mafia, government by insiders, government by regulation, or government by the voting people voting with their dollars, with their euros, with their rubles, with their yawns.
[01:07:56.887 --> 01:08:01.952]  You know, there are people rioting every day in towns and cities.
[01:08:01.952 --> 01:08:03.093]  Thousands of riots a week.
[01:08:06.278 --> 01:08:08.200]  In China, against their government.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.161]  They don't like communism.
[01:08:09.161 --> 01:08:14.786]  They don't like the insider system running everything with generals making billions off insider deals.
[01:08:14.786 --> 01:08:19.831]  But the Chinese people love free market folks that go out and actually create a business, actually create good products.
[01:08:20.757 --> 01:08:22.019]  Entrepreneurial spirit.
[01:08:22.019 --> 01:08:23.521]  You gotta admire it.
[01:08:23.521 --> 01:08:29.228]  That's what makes civilizations great is striving and building something better.
[01:08:29.228 --> 01:08:34.675]  Even if it's by 1% a month over time, it's 100% improvement.
[01:08:34.675 --> 01:08:38.599]  And that's what creates everything good in society is competition.
[01:08:38.599 --> 01:08:39.280]  It's a fact!
[01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:42.542]  And what does the nanny state seek to do?
[01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:44.925]  To get rid of competition.
[01:08:44.925 --> 01:08:52.897]  To not let kids play tag, or dodgeball, or then even run at break, or then even shake hands, or then you're total prisoners.
[01:08:53.809 --> 01:09:17.318]  Everything the system does is about weakening the host population to make us these little mindless human resource blobs to just go around in a managed economy with a bunch of government and select corporate bean counters who make their money and power out of control of systems, not out of having the best products, the best service, the best innovations, the best ideas.
[01:09:17.318 --> 01:09:21.580]  These people will cause another dark age if they have their way!
[01:09:23.405 --> 01:09:26.888]  It is that fundamental!
[01:09:26.888 --> 01:09:38.619]  But I'm telling you, if we ignore them, block them, don't comply where we can, civil disobedience against tyranny is obedience to God, folks.
[01:09:40.171 --> 01:09:42.513]  It is your duty to not do what the tyrants say.
[01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:47.316]  When it clearly violates the Bill of Rights and Constitution, common sense, your gut, it's not a law.
[01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:51.840]  Marbury versus Madison, anything violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution is null and void.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.741]  Exactly.
[01:09:52.741 --> 01:09:58.785]  And I've never talked like this the last few months, but this government is so lawless, so criminal, I'm a rule of law guy.
[01:09:58.785 --> 01:10:04.549]  And they're so criminal, it's now our duty to follow moral principles.
[01:10:04.549 --> 01:10:07.432]  Even if you don't believe in God, I think the Ten Commandments
[01:10:08.482 --> 01:10:20.713]  Judaic law, great common law, matches right up with the British and Celtic and Anglo-Saxon common law.
[01:10:20.713 --> 01:10:21.995]  Pretty much the same thing.
[01:10:21.995 --> 01:10:23.636]  Common law was always the same around the world.
[01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:27.159]  People figured out what was common sense and what should be done.
[01:10:27.159 --> 01:10:32.004]  And I say we go back to that, not this crud that they've got us following.
[01:10:32.004 --> 01:10:33.605]  And I'll tell you the good news, when I went out to
[01:10:34.875 --> 01:10:43.000]  I was invited out to Jesse James' private party here in Austin at the Rattle Inn, a really nice place, a really nice restaurant bar.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.525]  And I was invited out there to this rollout of his new firearms system.
[01:10:49.525 --> 01:10:50.806]  Really, I know guns, folks.
[01:10:50.806 --> 01:10:53.748]  These are amazing, amazing firearms.
[01:10:53.748 --> 01:10:57.870]  And by the way, I haven't been paid to say this, but I am going to get some for myself, obviously.
[01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:02.373]  My firearms only go up in value and something like that's going to only... How about Barrett .50 cals for $5,000?
[01:11:02.373 --> 01:11:02.794]  They're $15,000 now.
[01:11:06.926 --> 01:11:09.828]  That was a smart business decision, guys?
[01:11:09.828 --> 01:11:13.650]  Was that a smart business decision?
[01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:19.454]  To start buying .50 caliber rifles when Obama got elected and now they've all doubled or tripled or quadrupled in price?
[01:11:19.454 --> 01:11:26.339]  They went as high as $25,000 a piece when Obozo was trying to ban them.
[01:11:26.339 --> 01:11:27.820]  Now they've dropped back down to $15,000.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.180]  Thank God!
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:31.682]  I don't want to make money off losing the Second Amendment.
[01:11:31.682 --> 01:11:33.924]  The point is we're going to win in the culture
[01:11:35.074 --> 01:11:39.737]  By selling the idea of self-defense and lower crime.
[01:11:39.737 --> 01:11:48.143]  Chicago and New York City and DC with total gun bans have the highest crime rate in the country.
[01:11:48.143 --> 01:11:53.846]  And again, I'm no nuclear physicist or rocket scientist.
[01:11:53.846 --> 01:12:00.271]  I'm certainly not as smart as a socialist economist that Obama officially hired to run everything.
[01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:03.413]  But I do know, I do know,
[01:12:04.873 --> 01:12:12.476]  Uh, that historically, when you have these type of socialists and people running things, everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[01:12:12.476 --> 01:12:13.777]  And they know that too!
[01:12:13.777 --> 01:12:14.537]  That's their plan!
[01:12:14.537 --> 01:12:20.900]  They want to run it all, even if it runs it all on the ground, they want to be sitting on the pile of skulls.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:26.602]  Instead of on a pile of liberty and freedom and diversity and incredible, uh...
[01:12:28.312 --> 01:12:31.234]  Social development and empowerment.
[01:12:31.234 --> 01:12:36.256]  They'd rather reign in hell than serve in the heaven of free market.
[01:12:36.256 --> 01:12:37.097]  Well, let me say this.
[01:12:37.097 --> 01:12:43.900]  I'm happy to serve in the kingdom of free market and true diversity and choice and liberty and freedom.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:52.485]  I want to serve in that because being a servant in that is a trillion times better than reigning in Hades.
[01:12:52.485 --> 01:12:53.065]  That makes sense.
[01:12:59.844 --> 01:13:06.074]  Totally out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:06.074 --> 01:13:08.197]  Totally out of control.
[01:13:08.197 --> 01:13:09.539]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:13:09.539 --> 01:13:10.360]  Long segment coming up.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.323]  We're gonna come right back and talk to
[01:13:14.482 --> 01:13:19.986]  Clinton and Michael and Sonny and Daniel and Gavin and others that are loading up the phone system.
[01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:44.902]  I don't know.
[01:14:15.438 --> 01:14:16.181]  Pure genius.
[01:14:16.181 --> 01:14:22.181]  I mean, they could put Obama's face on a new plague.
[01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:28.193]  And people would inject their kids with it because they would be called racist if they didn't.
[01:14:28.193 --> 01:14:31.776]  I mean, it's all a cynical, sickening ploy.
[01:14:31.776 --> 01:14:35.038]  Oprah Winfrey knows exactly what she's doing.
[01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:36.379]  Do we have one of those clips again?
[01:14:36.379 --> 01:14:46.466]  There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism, and they just have to die.
[01:14:47.071 --> 01:14:48.091]  You're marinated in it.
[01:14:48.091 --> 01:14:48.751]  You live in it.
[01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:55.993]  Your whole world is about giving away 20 free cars to con all the women that watch your show, to believe they're going to get something free if they watch.
[01:14:55.993 --> 01:14:57.893]  It's the same thing as a lottery ticket.
[01:14:57.893 --> 01:15:01.674]  You know, you got one in a billion chances or whatever to win it, or even worse.
[01:15:01.674 --> 01:15:09.256]  And you got all these people shoving money in there and putting their paycheck, hoping they're... I mean, you're just nothing but a parasite.
[01:15:09.256 --> 01:15:10.276]  Ugh!
[01:15:10.276 --> 01:15:14.337]  What a race-baiting, disgusting parasite.
[01:15:16.403 --> 01:15:25.808]  Up there with their little twit British social engineer.
[01:15:25.808 --> 01:15:27.109]  Oh my gosh.
[01:15:27.109 --> 01:15:28.189]  They take our goodwill.
[01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:33.752]  They get us to sign on to their whole criminal agenda or they spank us with the paddle of racism.
[01:15:33.752 --> 01:15:36.114]  You can go straight to hell.
[01:15:36.114 --> 01:15:37.995]  I am sick of your race baiting crap.
[01:15:38.888 --> 01:15:52.658]  The Democratic Party, on record, ran the Ku Klux Klan, and then mainly white Christian Americans and others after World War II wouldn't be part of it anymore when they came back, along with black folks, and so you then flipped into race-baiting the Democratic Party.
[01:15:52.658 --> 01:15:57.982]  You're on, and your constituents don't even know the Republican Party got the Civil Rights Act passed, despite the Democrats.
[01:16:00.618 --> 01:16:07.841]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:16:07.841 --> 01:16:25.429]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:31.891]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Yungevity.
[01:16:31.891 --> 01:16:40.055]  The Yungevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:16:40.055 --> 01:16:41.475]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[01:16:43.576 --> 01:16:46.358]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:16:46.358 --> 01:16:47.639]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:16:47.639 --> 01:16:48.520]  It's incredible.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:57.727]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:16:57.727 --> 01:16:59.568]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:17:00.925 --> 01:17:06.386]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:17:06.386 --> 01:17:15.288]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:17:15.288 --> 01:17:23.109]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:17:23.109 --> 01:17:30.511]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:34.973]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:17:34.973 --> 01:17:39.155]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:46.298]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[01:17:46.298 --> 01:17:53.522]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front.
[01:17:53.522 --> 01:17:57.564]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[01:18:00.057 --> 01:18:03.520]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:09.465]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:18:09.465 --> 01:18:16.070]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:21.755]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:18:21.755 --> 01:18:25.398]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:18:25.578 --> 01:18:29.382]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:18:29.382 --> 01:18:33.986]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:18:33.986 --> 01:18:36.489]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:18:36.489 --> 01:18:40.353]  Don't dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:18:40.353 --> 01:18:44.777]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:18:44.777 --> 01:18:47.420]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:54.542]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:18:54.542 --> 01:18:59.783]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:18:59.783 --> 01:19:10.466]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:19:10.466 --> 01:19:12.306]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:19:12.526 --> 01:19:13.406]  Fluoride.
[01:19:13.406 --> 01:19:15.327]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:15.327 --> 01:19:21.910]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:26.831]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:19:26.831 --> 01:19:33.134]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:19:33.134 --> 01:19:35.555]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:19:35.555 --> 01:19:38.496]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:19:38.496 --> 01:19:41.877]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:19:41.997 --> 01:19:47.439]  You'll find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:47.439 --> 01:19:52.520]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.720]  I take it every day.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:20:01.543]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:20:01.543 --> 01:20:03.083]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:03.083 --> 01:20:05.124]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.124 --> 01:20:08.345]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:12.688 --> 01:20:14.108]  Got some bad news in the Midwest.
[01:20:14.108 --> 01:20:15.949]  The wind has swam towns and trucks.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.181]  Killed two, and over 30 injured so far.
[01:20:32.181 --> 01:20:35.523]  Undoubtedly those numbers will get worse as things develop.
[01:20:35.523 --> 01:20:43.846]  But again, statistically, you have a much better chance of dying in a car wreck or being struck by lightning than you do dying in a mass shooting.
[01:20:43.846 --> 01:20:52.190]  But people have the perception that there's an epidemic of mass shootings, even though overall crime with guns is down 49%, according to the Justice Department's own numbers since 1992.
[01:20:52.190 --> 01:20:54.911]  Which just shows that they can create the perception.
[01:20:54.911 --> 01:20:55.452]  The U.N.
[01:20:55.452 --> 01:20:57.773]  and others can fund one black tribe to kill the other.
[01:20:58.598 --> 01:21:03.220]  Like in Rwanda, famously, and then call it a UN screw-up.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:11.364]  And they do this kind of stuff all over the world, but nobody even knows about that, because we're too busy hearing how white people are inherently racist, because they won't turn their guns in.
[01:21:11.364 --> 01:21:15.326]  And because, if you think Obama is a liar, you're racist.
[01:21:15.326 --> 01:21:17.587]  I mean, you heard Oprah Winfrey.
[01:21:17.587 --> 01:21:21.469]  This is the type of garbage that we deal with as a society.
[01:21:21.469 --> 01:21:23.450]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:26.552]  Coming up, I'm going to play a clip where Bob Woodward... Oh, let's just do it now.
[01:21:27.452 --> 01:21:32.757]  Bob Woodward says the Obamacare fix will make the economy worse and will tank it faster.
[01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:35.360]  That's the Washington Post legendary reporter.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.402]  Well, of course, that's the plan.
[01:21:37.402 --> 01:21:42.827]  Tank the economy, except for select inside corporations that get government contracts.
[01:21:42.827 --> 01:21:44.989]  This is a consolidation phase.
[01:21:44.989 --> 01:21:47.592]  This is what big banks have done to farming belts for 150 years.
[01:21:47.592 --> 01:21:47.752]  Wake up!
[01:21:50.854 --> 01:21:57.023]  And as we go in two or three months from now and have more, are we going to shut down the government?
[01:21:57.023 --> 01:22:01.130]  Are we going to pay for the debt we have?
[01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:03.193]  All of a sudden this is going to come on the
[01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:04.359]  I think?
[01:22:26.093 --> 01:22:42.000]  By the way, Bob Woodward is high-level naval intelligence and a big insider.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.262]  You notice they're trying to act like Obama did all this now.
[01:22:46.262 --> 01:22:50.804]  This is a globalist torpedo to blow the engine of the economy for reorganization of the nation.
[01:22:50.804 --> 01:22:52.405]  It's a corporate takeover.
[01:22:52.405 --> 01:22:53.145]  Anti-free market.
[01:22:54.835 --> 01:22:56.096]  Okay?
[01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:57.998]  That's what's going on here.
[01:22:57.998 --> 01:22:59.239]  That's what's happening.
[01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:01.260]  And I'm not saying Obama's a good guy.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.341]  He's horrible.
[01:23:02.341 --> 01:23:07.305]  But his controllers are even worse, and we need to recognize that it isn't just about Obama.
[01:23:07.305 --> 01:23:10.268]  And notice Woodward's like, oh, executive action will fix this.
[01:23:10.268 --> 01:23:12.630]  This is a law!
[01:23:12.630 --> 01:23:19.315]  Oh, now the guy that got the law in, he has to have more power to fix it.
[01:23:19.315 --> 01:23:21.497]  Because the Democrats taking orders from Obama
[01:23:23.186 --> 01:23:25.007]  We'll not repeal it in the House or Senate.
[01:23:25.007 --> 01:23:27.729]  They already had a vote.
[01:23:27.729 --> 01:23:30.151]  It passed in the House to repeal it.
[01:23:30.151 --> 01:23:32.172]  Obama says he'll veto it.
[01:23:32.172 --> 01:23:34.273]  The 39 Democrats, or was it 37 Democrats, went over to
[01:23:40.643 --> 01:23:41.844]  The Republican side.
[01:23:41.844 --> 01:23:44.327]  Again, I'm not romanticizing the Republicans either.
[01:23:44.327 --> 01:23:46.670]  The Republicans helped write this monstrosity.
[01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:48.492]  They're owned by the same special interests.
[01:23:48.492 --> 01:23:55.621]  It's just that now a lot of good Tea Party people have gotten in who I know are real Americans and do care.
[01:23:55.621 --> 01:24:00.226]  I mean, I went to this event last night, this rollout of a new firearms line.
[01:24:01.067 --> 01:24:17.224]  And there was really a who's who of people there, top-level national NRA people, high-level state police folks who were friends with Jesse James, and others, a lot of Navy SEALs and Special Warfare people and some movie stars and folks.
[01:24:17.224 --> 01:24:22.189]  And they were all genuinely concerned about what's going on in a wake.
[01:24:23.135 --> 01:24:24.837]  I mean, look, see, that's the deal.
[01:24:24.837 --> 01:24:31.145]  Once you get to a point of this stuff, we warn people, it came true, it's getting worse, folks now are listening.
[01:24:31.145 --> 01:24:33.468]  Not just to me, but they're listening to what's really going on.
[01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:38.554]  You go research this stuff, you'll find out exactly what I've said is accurate.
[01:24:38.554 --> 01:24:39.896]  And that's what I said in the first hour.
[01:24:39.896 --> 01:24:42.259]  I wish every day that that wasn't the case.
[01:24:43.706 --> 01:24:44.466]  I wish I was wrong.
[01:24:44.466 --> 01:24:47.067]  Let's take a few calls now and really go to them in the next segment.
[01:24:47.067 --> 01:24:58.551]  Wes, Clinton, Michael, Sonny, Daniel, Gavin, Tom, Nick, Dan, Ender, Tony, Christy.
[01:24:58.551 --> 01:25:01.852]  Let's go to a girl first.
[01:25:01.852 --> 01:25:05.353]  Let's talk to Christy in California, then we'll go to Clinton and others.
[01:25:05.353 --> 01:25:06.814]  Christy, you're on the air.
[01:25:06.814 --> 01:25:07.154]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:07.154 --> 01:25:08.614]  How are you doing?
[01:25:08.614 --> 01:25:09.335]  I'm doing pretty good.
[01:25:09.335 --> 01:25:09.635]  Welcome.
[01:25:09.635 --> 01:25:10.155]  Thank you for calling.
[01:25:10.776 --> 01:25:11.517]  Thank you.
[01:25:11.517 --> 01:25:16.020]  Um, I wanted to ask you if you've heard of Paul Maguire.
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:17.821]  Sure, your phone's a little foggy to me.
[01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:19.082]  Say that again?
[01:25:19.082 --> 01:25:22.265]  Have you heard of Paul Maguire?
[01:25:22.265 --> 01:25:23.065]  It rings a bell.
[01:25:23.065 --> 01:25:24.446]  Who is it?
[01:25:24.446 --> 01:25:25.447]  He's an author.
[01:25:25.447 --> 01:25:26.988]  He's written 22 books.
[01:25:26.988 --> 01:25:29.250]  He's been on CNN, before Fox.
[01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:32.713]  He is a prophecy expert.
[01:25:32.713 --> 01:25:35.115]  And he's also, obviously, very awake.
[01:25:35.115 --> 01:25:38.237]  And he tells how the two work together.
[01:25:38.237 --> 01:25:40.279]  I mean, how Bible prophecy works into
[01:25:42.603 --> 01:25:56.647]  Well, we should probably have folks like that on to debate about what they think we should do.
[01:25:56.647 --> 01:26:01.609]  Because, and I'm not familiar with his work, but I've heard the name.
[01:26:01.609 --> 01:26:05.950]  Most of these prophecy folks say it's the end of the world, you know, ten years ago or a month from now.
[01:26:06.988 --> 01:26:08.189]  They're wrong all the time.
[01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:10.551]  I'm not saying he said this, but you know, the preachers.
[01:26:10.551 --> 01:26:13.973]  And then it's an excuse to never do anything about what's happening.
[01:26:13.973 --> 01:26:22.179]  If the Antichrist and all this stuff and the Mark of the Beast and all this is really coming, isn't that the reason to warn people so that they don't get deceived?
[01:26:22.179 --> 01:26:24.301]  It just becomes this big cop-out.
[01:26:24.301 --> 01:26:24.841]  But I hear you.
[01:26:24.841 --> 01:26:26.002]  Maybe we should interview him.
[01:26:26.002 --> 01:26:26.903]  Shake the show up.
[01:26:26.903 --> 01:26:28.544]  Let's get him on.
[01:26:28.544 --> 01:26:31.646]  Let's go ahead and go to Clinton in Georgia.
[01:26:31.646 --> 01:26:32.207]  You're on the air.
[01:26:32.207 --> 01:26:32.467]  Welcome.
[01:26:34.207 --> 01:26:38.109]  Hey Alex, it's a pleasure to be on Wine with you.
[01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:44.832]  I've been our avid supporter of InfoWoods for about a year now and it's been life changing.
[01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:49.114]  I wanted to call and talk about Divide and Conquer.
[01:26:49.114 --> 01:26:58.018]  I do live in the inner city of Atlanta and I am black and I just wanted to let you know that there are a lot of people around here that are all waking up.
[01:26:58.018 --> 01:27:00.059]  I think that the major problem
[01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:29.646]  With the black community and waking up and everything is the whole hip-hop culture and the social engineering and I was caught up in it myself for a long time and I explained to my friends about the Tavistock Institute and the Illuminati entertainment industry and I have a lot of people that come around real easy when I play them the Professor Griff interviews
[01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:35.990]  And the Rick Ross interviews and the different things that you've done with a lot of people in the black community.
[01:27:37.183 --> 01:27:37.684]  Exactly.
[01:27:37.684 --> 01:27:41.206]  The last thing they want is us working together as human beings.
[01:27:41.206 --> 01:27:42.387]  They want us divided.
[01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:44.128]  And you see, you've done the research.
[01:27:44.128 --> 01:27:52.133]  You mentioned Tavistock Institute, declassified out of England since the 50s, running major TV here in the U.S.
[01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:53.734]  with all these messages.
[01:27:53.734 --> 01:27:55.756]  And look what they've done to us.
[01:27:55.756 --> 01:27:57.096]  And it's declassified.
[01:27:57.096 --> 01:28:02.760]  It's on record that British psych warfare chiefs run our media.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.322]  And the average person doesn't even know what that is.
[01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:06.603]  Shouldn't they know what that is?
[01:28:07.603 --> 01:28:09.144]  Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[01:28:09.144 --> 01:28:16.106]  Because, um, I tell them all the time, all the information is right there if you just want to take the time and go and look for it.
[01:28:16.106 --> 01:28:22.228]  And, um, I think what's crazy is a lot of people at the point now where they don't even want to look for information.
[01:28:22.228 --> 01:28:25.809]  They just rather go along, you get along and pretend nothing's going on.
[01:28:27.088 --> 01:28:28.229]  Well, I do.
[01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:30.451]  There are a lot of people waking up in the inner city.
[01:28:30.451 --> 01:28:34.274]  A lot of black people that are supporters of you and followers of you.
[01:28:34.274 --> 01:28:39.718]  And I think what we all need to do is take the time to reach out to the different race.
[01:28:39.718 --> 01:28:42.460]  And white people reach out to black people with this air phone.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:44.182]  And black people reach out to white people.
[01:28:44.182 --> 01:28:45.223]  Because at the end of the day,
[01:28:45.993 --> 01:28:48.756]  We all created in the image of God.
[01:29:00.689 --> 01:29:03.712]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:29:03.712 --> 01:29:08.717]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:29:08.717 --> 01:29:16.044]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:29:16.044 --> 01:29:21.689]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowarsshop.com.
[01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:23.851]  These are items that I did research on.
[01:29:23.951 --> 01:29:25.692]  That I personally use.
[01:29:25.692 --> 01:29:30.416]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:29:30.416 --> 01:29:35.900]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.122]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:29:39.122 --> 01:29:41.624]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:29:41.624 --> 01:29:46.388]  Therosafe, used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:29:46.388 --> 01:29:48.810]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.

[01:29:58.413 --> 01:30:00.514]  InfoWarshop.com.
[01:30:00.514 --> 01:30:05.036]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:30:05.236 --> 01:30:13.903]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[01:30:13.903 --> 01:30:15.845]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:30:15.845 --> 01:30:17.486]  We are what we eat.
[01:30:17.486 --> 01:30:22.150]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:26.373]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:30:26.373 --> 01:30:28.935]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:30:28.935 --> 01:30:34.840]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:31:00.854 --> 01:31:07.478]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:31:07.478 --> 01:31:09.960]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.320]  The U.S.
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:14.562]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:31:14.562 --> 01:31:17.524]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:31:17.524 --> 01:31:19.005]  They want that attack to come.
[01:31:19.005 --> 01:31:25.189]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:31:25.589 --> 01:31:28.250]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:33.212]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:31:33.212 --> 01:31:40.654]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:31:40.954 --> 01:31:43.716]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:31:43.716 --> 01:31:46.818]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:31:46.818 --> 01:31:51.382]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:10.643]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:10.643 --> 01:32:12.703]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:12.703 --> 01:32:13.584]  Fluoride.
[01:32:13.584 --> 01:32:15.504]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:15.504 --> 01:32:21.806]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:32:22.066 --> 01:32:27.011]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:32:27.011 --> 01:32:33.317]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:32:33.317 --> 01:32:35.739]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:32:35.739 --> 01:32:38.682]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:32:38.682 --> 01:32:42.065]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:32:42.185 --> 01:32:47.608]  You'll find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:47.608 --> 01:32:52.712]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:33:01.617 --> 01:33:03.138]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:03.138 --> 01:33:05.199]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.199 --> 01:33:08.401]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:13.314 --> 01:33:16.898]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:16.898 --> 01:33:21.023]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:38.593 --> 01:33:42.196]  Alright, let's continue to race through your phone calls here.
[01:33:42.196 --> 01:33:48.901]  I just briefly want to remember here on air right now to take my vitamins, take my nutrients, take my minerals.
[01:33:48.901 --> 01:33:52.864]  As you know, I've done deep research with medical doctors, scientists, nutritionists, you name it.
[01:33:53.684 --> 01:33:59.248]  And found that, well I call it the halogen conspiracy, or you call it the iodine conspiracy, but really it's the halogen.
[01:33:59.248 --> 01:34:03.571]  It's the only good thing in the halogen area of the periodic table.
[01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:11.077]  The fluorines that fluoride comes out of, and the bromide, and all the stuff they put in the food, literally zombifies people.
[01:34:11.077 --> 01:34:12.378]  Just go look up the medical literature.
[01:34:13.533 --> 01:34:31.710]  And because of deficiencies in iodine in 1924, there was so much retardation, so much gouter, so many health problems, so many diseases, the federal government mandated that iodine be added to salt and bread.
[01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:39.452]  And then by the 50s, the globalists took over completely and said, no, remove that as a sick joke.
[01:34:39.452 --> 01:34:41.373]  And they put fluoride.
[01:34:41.373 --> 01:34:42.814]  Now they're fluoridating bread, by the way.
[01:34:42.814 --> 01:34:43.794]  That's not coming out.
[01:34:43.794 --> 01:34:45.355]  And a bunch of other foods.
[01:34:45.355 --> 01:34:49.517]  They added the bromide and other things to the food.
[01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:51.458]  So it's incredible.
[01:34:51.458 --> 01:34:54.400]  I have been taking this about two and a half months and the mental clarity
[01:34:56.042 --> 01:35:00.483]  And what it's done for me is exactly what pharmacist Ben Fuchs said it would do.
[01:35:00.483 --> 01:35:05.165]  It's exactly what people like Dr. Edward Group said it would do.
[01:35:05.165 --> 01:35:06.905]  And nobody even knew about this.
[01:35:06.905 --> 01:35:08.345]  There's no other nation I'm like it.
[01:35:08.345 --> 01:35:10.286]  It's truly unbound in the glycerin base.
[01:35:10.286 --> 01:35:13.027]  So it doesn't taste like rocket fuel and burn your throat.
[01:35:13.027 --> 01:35:14.907]  And it's incredibly bioavailable.
[01:35:14.907 --> 01:35:16.348]  And I take it in the morning and night.
[01:35:16.348 --> 01:35:17.268]  I take the recommended dose.
[01:35:17.268 --> 01:35:19.729]  And if you have any questions, consult your physician first.
[01:35:19.729 --> 01:35:22.849]  But let me tell you, this is a big secret right here.
[01:35:22.849 --> 01:35:24.490]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:35:26.812 --> 01:35:29.115]  The first of a long line of products we're developing.
[01:35:29.115 --> 01:35:30.657]  People are like, well, you've had this out a few months.
[01:35:30.657 --> 01:35:31.499]  Where's the other products?
[01:35:31.499 --> 01:35:39.650]  Well, if you don't just bring people incredibly high quality products overnight, we are going to have, well, I'm not going to get into it.
[01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:43.615]  The point is, is we've got some spectacular things in the pipeline.
[01:35:44.491 --> 01:35:49.998]  But I came out with the most exciting discovery and formula first.
[01:35:49.998 --> 01:35:51.040]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.882]  Our call toll free.
[01:35:52.882 --> 01:35:55.245]  By the way, we were sold out of this for a few weeks, as you know.
[01:35:55.245 --> 01:35:57.729]  We now have a large cash of an end from the
[01:35:59.181 --> 01:35:59.802]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:22.945 --> 01:36:24.986]  Use it, then lobby to destroy the Bill of Rights.
[01:36:24.986 --> 01:36:27.287]  First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Second Amendment, Tenth Amendment.
[01:36:27.287 --> 01:36:27.567]  No, no.
[01:36:27.567 --> 01:36:28.728]  We free market.
[01:36:28.728 --> 01:36:30.909]  Say, if you think this is high quality, good deal.
[01:36:30.909 --> 01:36:32.850]  Support us, and we'll support your freedom.
[01:36:32.850 --> 01:36:33.850]  It's real simple.
[01:36:33.850 --> 01:36:36.472]  It's called Free Association.
[01:36:36.472 --> 01:36:37.772]  And the media demonizes it.
[01:36:37.772 --> 01:36:39.933]  Jones sells products!
[01:36:39.933 --> 01:36:41.014]  Dun, dun, dun!
[01:36:41.014 --> 01:36:42.114]  Nightline!
[01:36:42.114 --> 01:36:44.596]  Oh my gosh, it's so dirty!
[01:36:46.577 --> 01:36:54.418]  So, Evo, you should be like NPR and get hundreds of millions or 500 million a year of taxpayer money.
[01:36:54.418 --> 01:36:55.839]  Let's go to the phone calls.
[01:36:55.839 --> 01:37:00.339]  Let's talk to Michael in Texas from an extremist state of evil people.
[01:37:00.339 --> 01:37:02.480]  Go ahead, extremist.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:02.920]  Hey, Alex.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.100]  How you feeling, my friend?
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:05.760]  I'm feeling pretty good right now.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.001]  Well, I'm feeling great.
[01:37:07.001 --> 01:37:08.941]  I mean, you do not screen calls.
[01:37:08.941 --> 01:37:12.241]  You took my name and where I was from.
[01:37:12.241 --> 01:37:14.742]  You could have said you were a cabler elf from the moon, brother.
[01:37:15.461 --> 01:37:16.221]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:37:16.221 --> 01:37:25.244]  By the way, I started the Austrian Economics group on Planet Info Wars, so if you want to see me and say I'm a real human being, I'm on there.
[01:37:25.244 --> 01:37:26.184]  PlanetInfoWars.com.
[01:37:26.184 --> 01:37:26.984]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:37:26.984 --> 01:37:28.625]  That's right, Mike DeInfecta.
[01:37:28.625 --> 01:37:30.105]  So, a couple scary things.
[01:37:30.105 --> 01:37:35.427]  By the way, right on my counter is my Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 and my
[01:37:37.311 --> 01:37:40.935]  My Nathan iodine, that stuff tastes fantastic by the way.
[01:37:40.935 --> 01:37:43.858]  How long have you been on it?
[01:37:43.858 --> 01:37:47.181]  You know, I was going to say, I've been on it for about 45 days.
[01:37:47.181 --> 01:37:48.182]  I got two bottles.
[01:37:48.996 --> 01:38:12.610]  From the outset and I've been taking two whole droppers two times a day and I actually got those symptoms that you were talking about weeks ago where you almost had the detox and you almost feel worse for a few days but then man it's just like one day I woke up and I mean I don't believe in this metaphysical you know third eye chakra but one day I just felt like man I just I feel more alert and awake today I feel like
[01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:14.511]  You know, I've got all these ideas.
[01:38:14.511 --> 01:38:16.272]  I went on and bought a domain name.
[01:38:16.272 --> 01:38:17.373]  Well, yeah, that's the big secret.
[01:38:17.373 --> 01:38:18.894]  With the FDA, we're not going to make any claims.
[01:38:18.894 --> 01:38:19.834]  Just see what it does for you.
[01:38:19.834 --> 01:38:23.537]  But again, the mystics all in primitive times gave it a name.
[01:38:23.537 --> 01:38:27.659]  When you get all your glands lined up, look, look, what does what are the halogens do?
[01:38:27.659 --> 01:38:31.261]  The bad ones, the fluoride, the fluorine, all that garbage, the bromine, the bromide.
[01:38:31.261 --> 01:38:37.425]  They go into the pineal, the pituitary, the thyroid, according to the doctors.
[01:38:37.425 --> 01:38:39.567]  And then because your body needs it needs a
[01:38:40.727 --> 01:38:41.428]  Iodine.
[01:38:41.428 --> 01:38:44.430]  But if it doesn't get it, it will take a bad halogen.
[01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:47.172]  You know, your body will use whatever it can get.
[01:38:47.172 --> 01:38:53.437]  And so, it's just, look, look, look, the government put it in the food and then had it removed.
[01:38:53.437 --> 01:38:54.978]  Why do you, I mean, it's incredible.
[01:38:54.978 --> 01:38:55.599]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:38:55.599 --> 01:38:56.439]  On purpose.
[01:38:56.439 --> 01:38:59.542]  No, I was going to tell you, I went to Mises University.
[01:38:59.542 --> 01:39:03.545]  I was, you know, invited by Lew Rockwell.
[01:39:03.545 --> 01:39:07.148]  And I got invited to Judge Napolitano's.
[01:39:07.948 --> 01:39:08.569]  That's awesome!
[01:39:08.569 --> 01:39:08.889]  But this wasn't?
[01:39:32.625 --> 01:39:36.807]  Well, listen, I'm friends with him, and he's been under a lot of pressure.
[01:39:36.807 --> 01:39:40.148]  He basically wouldn't compromise, and that's why he lost his TV show.
[01:39:40.148 --> 01:39:43.349]  So, you know, discretion sometimes is good.
[01:39:43.349 --> 01:39:48.771]  And I'm not saying we do secret stuff or anything, but maybe if he didn't want it publicly known, maybe he shouldn't have said what he said.
[01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:58.109]  Well, later on, in the conference, he said, look, I just didn't want it taped and sent all over the place, so... What did he say?
[01:39:58.109 --> 01:40:01.010]  We're in deep trouble, and this is real?
[01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:05.593]  Well, his parents are getting up in age, and he's lost a lot of weight, by the way.
[01:40:05.593 --> 01:40:06.454]  He looks fantastic.
[01:40:06.454 --> 01:40:07.194]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[01:40:07.194 --> 01:40:10.076]  So he's real angry about the death panels, which are in there.
[01:40:10.076 --> 01:40:17.221]  He is, but he sat there at the front, at the desk, and he started walking around, and he had this very serious face on, and he said, look,
[01:40:18.092 --> 01:40:26.881]  I imagine myself someday perishing, dying, going to sleep in my own bed at home surrounded by my loved ones in peace.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:37.690]  And in contentment knowing that I've lived a good life and that all my family and friends would be around me and watch me transition to the next phase.
[01:40:37.690 --> 01:40:38.771]  But you know what?
[01:40:38.771 --> 01:40:52.584]  He said, I'm beginning to think now that people like us who do and say what we do because we believe that liberty is the engine of prosperity and because we believe in natural rights and that we're not slaves
[01:40:53.698 --> 01:41:01.020]  That we may end up, you know, hung in a town square somewhere, or if we're lucky, die in prison.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:04.521]  That's how crazy things are getting in this world.
[01:41:04.521 --> 01:41:06.962]  That's what the Secret Service is telling me.
[01:41:06.962 --> 01:41:14.984]  They will not tell me what has gone on at the White House, but they literally are like looking to quit and leave the country.
[01:41:14.984 --> 01:41:19.685]  I mean, I had Dan Bongino on Friday basically talking about it, but it's bad.
[01:41:19.685 --> 01:41:20.485]  I mean, it's real bad.
[01:41:20.985 --> 01:41:27.087]  And that's the thing is, historically good people cannot believe something really bad is happening because we can't think like that.
[01:41:27.087 --> 01:41:29.168]  And then it actually happens.
[01:41:29.168 --> 01:41:31.769]  But look, America is not Germany, it's not Russia.
[01:41:31.769 --> 01:41:34.910]  Nothing against the Russians or the Germans, but they didn't have a history of freedom.
[01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:37.190]  We've had some history of freedom.
[01:41:37.190 --> 01:41:46.193]  The founders put emergency switches in there, like the Second Amendment, and juries, you know, that's another key box.
[01:41:49.915 --> 01:41:51.736]  Yeah, no, it's bad.
[01:41:51.736 --> 01:42:01.924]  I mean, look, let me tell you, that's why I'm freaking out right now, is that people aren't disagreeing with me now across the board.
[01:42:01.924 --> 01:42:03.625]  I mean, you name it, billionaires,
[01:42:06.451 --> 01:42:09.413]  Top government people, generals, you name it.
[01:42:09.413 --> 01:42:14.896]  It's like weird, like, I'm a guy that's been here from the start in opposition, so I get all this credibility.
[01:42:14.896 --> 01:42:16.737]  I'm just a regular guy that doesn't want to be a slave.
[01:42:16.737 --> 01:42:22.881]  It's really kind of creepy, actually, to see an awakening this big.
[01:42:22.881 --> 01:42:27.224]  But anything else that Napolitano said that was on record?
[01:42:27.224 --> 01:42:29.986]  Well, I mean, I ate meals with him and Lou Rockwell.
[01:42:29.986 --> 01:42:33.628]  I sat in the judge's new office there at the Mises Institute in Auburn.
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:47.268]  He just said, look, do whatever you can right now, you know, just like if you were at a funeral and this was your last chance that you could say something, you know, for and about somebody who just passed away.
[01:42:47.268 --> 01:42:49.209]  That's how you need to look at this republic.
[01:42:49.209 --> 01:42:50.029]  Exactly.
[01:42:50.029 --> 01:42:51.370]  Every day is precious.
[01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:52.651]  Exactly.
[01:42:52.651 --> 01:42:55.193]  That is exactly what's going on.
[01:42:55.193 --> 01:42:58.394]  I mean, this country has got terminal cancer, folks.
[01:42:58.394 --> 01:42:58.935]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:01.314 --> 01:43:06.796]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:43:06.796 --> 01:43:15.678]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:43:15.678 --> 01:43:23.501]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:30.903]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[01:44:03.421 --> 01:44:08.425]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:44:08.425 --> 01:44:15.611]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:44:15.731 --> 01:44:21.374]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:46:00.424 --> 01:46:07.069]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:46:07.069 --> 01:46:09.451]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:46:09.451 --> 01:46:09.911]  The U.S.
[01:46:09.911 --> 01:46:14.135]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:46:14.135 --> 01:46:17.097]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:46:17.097 --> 01:46:18.578]  They want that attack to come.
[01:46:18.578 --> 01:46:24.803]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:46:25.168 --> 01:46:27.830]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:32.793]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:46:32.793 --> 01:46:40.218]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:46:40.538 --> 01:46:43.299]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:46:43.299 --> 01:46:46.401]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:46:46.401 --> 01:46:50.963]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[01:47:11.311 --> 01:47:17.276]  Yeah, what happened to your Obamacare, folks?
[01:47:17.276 --> 01:47:31.489]  Look at these headlines right here.
[01:47:35.996 --> 01:47:43.244]  Legalizing illegal immigrants is the solution to Obamacare, says Democrat Jared Polis.
[01:47:43.244 --> 01:47:44.886]  Yes, that's the answer.
[01:47:44.886 --> 01:47:49.050]  Give more free stuff to people that isn't even free, unless you're an illegal.
[01:47:49.050 --> 01:47:54.536]  New Jersey bill to offer in-state tuition, financial aid to immigrants in the country illegally.
[01:47:54.536 --> 01:47:56.318]  But if you're from a nearby state, you won't get it.
[01:48:01.627 --> 01:48:05.332]  Obama relying more on immigration rule changes.
[01:48:05.332 --> 01:48:06.554]  Gotta love AP.
[01:48:06.554 --> 01:48:08.477]  Yeah, who needs a Congress or law?
[01:48:08.477 --> 01:48:09.879]  It's just he rules.
[01:48:09.879 --> 01:48:11.561]  What does it mean when one man rules?
[01:48:11.561 --> 01:48:12.803]  Dictatorship.
[01:48:14.656 --> 01:48:16.017]  He says he'll do that with Obamacare.
[01:48:16.017 --> 01:48:17.377]  Well, what's wrong with that?
[01:48:17.377 --> 01:48:20.179]  If you don't want him to make all the decisions, you're racist.
[01:48:20.179 --> 01:48:20.779]  U.S.
[01:48:20.779 --> 01:48:25.621]  business leader remains confident Boner will seek immigration reform.
[01:48:25.621 --> 01:48:26.262]  That's right.
[01:48:26.262 --> 01:48:30.744]  All the big bankers, all the big establishment insiders, they want to drive down your wages.
[01:48:30.744 --> 01:48:32.605]  The anti-free market people.
[01:48:32.605 --> 01:48:34.866]  The race to the bottom.
[01:48:34.866 --> 01:48:38.347]  They have the unions endorsing to have illegals come in and take their jobs.
[01:48:38.347 --> 01:48:38.908]  Gotta love that.
[01:48:39.639 --> 01:48:41.760]  Well, why don't the unions just pass out pistols?
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:44.061]  They can all shoot themselves in the head.
[01:48:44.061 --> 01:48:45.882]  Here's another one.
[01:48:45.882 --> 01:48:51.584]  39 Democrats break with Obama to pass the so-called fix.
[01:48:51.584 --> 01:48:54.545]  And that is, of course, a plan to let people have their old health care.
[01:48:54.545 --> 01:48:55.025]  No, no, no.
[01:48:55.025 --> 01:48:55.766]  You're not going to get that.
[01:48:55.766 --> 01:48:59.347]  UnitedHealth drops thousands of doctors from insurance plans.
[01:48:59.347 --> 01:49:00.908]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:49:00.908 --> 01:49:01.308]  D.C.
[01:49:01.308 --> 01:49:05.450]  insurance commissioner fired a day after questioning Obamacare fix.
[01:49:07.031 --> 01:49:09.012]  Fraudsters are exploiting new healthcare law.
[01:49:09.012 --> 01:49:11.374]  That's like saying fish are swimming in the ocean.
[01:49:11.374 --> 01:49:14.997]  One con telling Medicare beneficiaries they must choose new plans.
[01:49:14.997 --> 01:49:19.780]  Yeah, and it's the White House pays the navigators to say that.
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:22.322]  But if you're against being defrauded, you're a racist.
[01:49:22.322 --> 01:49:23.243]  I'm not a racist.
[01:49:23.243 --> 01:49:25.224]  I say let Obama do whatever he wants.
[01:49:25.224 --> 01:49:29.487]  I say increase the plan's prices a hundred times, not just five times.
[01:49:29.487 --> 01:49:32.489]  And just do whatever Obama says.
[01:49:32.489 --> 01:49:34.671]  Kind of like, who was that singer?
[01:49:36.144 --> 01:49:40.267]  Britney Spears who said, just do whatever Bush says, he's our leader, just shut up and do it.
[01:49:40.267 --> 01:49:41.148]  I agree.
[01:49:41.148 --> 01:49:43.230]  Obama is God.
[01:49:43.230 --> 01:49:44.150]  How's that sound?
[01:49:44.150 --> 01:49:45.731]  Now, can I be on MSNBC?
[01:49:45.731 --> 01:49:47.693]  Even though I have a tiny audience?
[01:49:47.693 --> 01:49:55.719]  Can I hang out with the luscious Maddow, daughter of Janet Reno?
[01:49:55.719 --> 01:49:57.881]  Feminine beauty of that woman.
[01:49:57.881 --> 01:50:00.523]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sonny in Washington.
[01:50:00.523 --> 01:50:03.965]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:50:03.965 --> 01:50:05.166]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:50:07.185 --> 01:50:12.528]  Hey man, I wanted to talk to you about Armageddon.
[01:50:12.528 --> 01:50:13.588]  Trendygeddon?
[01:50:13.588 --> 01:50:15.669]  Tell me about it.
[01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:21.192]  Well, you know, when most people think about Armageddon, they think of the end of time or the end of the world.
[01:50:21.192 --> 01:50:29.116]  But the way I see Armageddon is simply when and where the Gentiles will be stopped from ruling over the world anymore.
[01:50:29.116 --> 01:50:30.176]  The Gentiles?
[01:50:30.176 --> 01:50:32.417]  What's a Gentile?
[01:50:32.417 --> 01:50:33.998]  God, you know, destroying God's people?
[01:50:38.669 --> 01:50:39.589]  Oh, can you hear me?
[01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:40.730]  Yes, I'm listening to you.
[01:50:40.730 --> 01:50:44.692]  So you're saying everyone else but people that live in Israel?
[01:50:44.692 --> 01:50:47.053]  Well, no.
[01:50:47.053 --> 01:50:49.074]  Look at... You mean Gentiles?
[01:50:49.074 --> 01:50:50.614]  You mean Gentiles?
[01:50:50.614 --> 01:50:51.255]  Excuse me, yes.
[01:50:51.255 --> 01:50:53.035]  Excuse me.
[01:50:53.035 --> 01:51:04.821]  So Revelation 17 talks about the seven kings and the seven... the kings... And the ten kingdoms and the seven kings that give their power to the little horn?
[01:51:04.821 --> 01:51:06.502]  Yes, sir.
[01:51:06.502 --> 01:51:07.382]  So you think about...
[01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:13.633]  How America and the Constitution's being eviscerated, and you talk about divide and conquer.
[01:51:13.633 --> 01:51:15.954]  Well, that's exactly what it is.
[01:51:15.954 --> 01:51:18.836]  You hit the hammer, you hit the nail on the head with that one.
[01:51:18.836 --> 01:51:23.598]  I hit the hammer on the head!
[01:51:23.598 --> 01:51:35.125]  You think about, uh, Daniel chapter 2 talks about the, uh, the dream he had about the rock, uh, cast upon the feet of iron and clay.
[01:51:38.154 --> 01:51:43.438]  Well, there's no doubt the globalist system is designed to rise as it collapses.
[01:51:43.438 --> 01:51:47.501]  Because it collapses society and then it builds on itself.
[01:51:47.501 --> 01:51:49.482]  So, it's very sophisticated.
[01:51:49.482 --> 01:51:52.104]  All I know is it's really creepy how much of the Bible is coming true.
[01:51:52.104 --> 01:51:54.306]  I mean, if that doesn't make you a believer, I don't know what does.
[01:51:54.306 --> 01:51:55.727]  I appreciate your call.
[01:51:55.727 --> 01:52:01.030]  And I mean a believer on what's in the Bible, not what these churches, government run, are teaching.
[01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:04.693]  Let's go ahead and talk to Daniel in Louisiana.
[01:52:04.693 --> 01:52:05.414]  You're on the air.
[01:52:05.414 --> 01:52:07.235]  Thanks for calling in this evening.
[01:52:09.301 --> 01:52:10.321]  Brother, good to hear from you.
[01:52:10.321 --> 01:52:11.861]  Worldwide broadcast.
[01:52:11.861 --> 01:52:12.962]  Yep, yep, yep.
[01:52:12.962 --> 01:52:13.622]  You know what?
[01:52:13.622 --> 01:52:18.203]  There's a lot of stuff swirling, a lot of controversy swirling, a lot of stuff swirling around.
[01:52:18.203 --> 01:52:19.463]  But let me tell you something.
[01:52:19.463 --> 01:52:27.044]  One thing that is definitely concrete, crystallized, is government tyranny is out of control right now.
[01:52:27.044 --> 01:52:30.485]  Now, sir, are you saying Obama is a tyrant?
[01:52:30.485 --> 01:52:31.305]  I am, sir.
[01:52:31.305 --> 01:52:32.745]  That is racist.
[01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:33.445]  I know it is, sir.
[01:52:33.445 --> 01:52:36.446]  Did you hear Oprah Winfrey say that if you say he's lying about healthcare,
[01:52:37.822 --> 01:52:39.965]  Uh, that's racist, sir.
[01:52:39.965 --> 01:52:40.466]  You know what?
[01:52:40.466 --> 01:52:48.358]  The definition of racism and of racist is that you simply point out that the races have different characteristics.
[01:52:48.792 --> 01:52:52.393]  So just be an informed person and say it.
[01:52:52.393 --> 01:52:57.575]  Well, sir, if you're informed that they're cancelling 10 million people's health care plans, it's going to be 52 million.
[01:52:57.575 --> 01:52:58.376]  That's racist.
[01:52:58.376 --> 01:53:01.237]  Obama says nobody's plan's being cancelled.
[01:53:01.237 --> 01:53:03.958]  Now, he later admitted that was not true, but it doesn't matter.
[01:53:03.958 --> 01:53:08.540]  Like, like, like, I choose to worship his previous statement, not his new statement.
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:10.340]  Like, like, that's another great part about Obama.
[01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:12.381]  You've got all these different conflicting statements.
[01:53:12.381 --> 01:53:13.922]  You can pick whichever one you want.
[01:53:14.713 --> 01:53:16.294]  And I think that's good.
[01:53:16.294 --> 01:53:17.335]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:53:17.335 --> 01:53:19.116]  That's very racist, Daniel.
[01:53:19.116 --> 01:53:23.479]  Gavin in California, please don't question our dear leader, Kim Jong Un.
[01:53:23.479 --> 01:53:24.360]  I mean Obama.
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.941]  I mean, dear leader Obama.
[01:53:25.941 --> 01:53:26.262]  Go ahead.
[01:53:26.262 --> 01:53:27.562]  Go ahead.
[01:53:27.562 --> 01:53:39.852]  Well, what I want to talk to you, Alex, is the beautiful surprise JPMorgan thinks they're going to lay out on us in February through their hedge fund managers.
[01:53:39.852 --> 01:53:41.052]  Here's what's going on.
[01:53:41.052 --> 01:53:43.154]  JPMorgan hedge fund managers that they've
[01:53:43.686 --> 01:53:49.009]  Pumping up several different retail chains for the last 10 years.
[01:53:49.009 --> 01:53:54.332]  What they've also been doing is a very interesting way of employment.
[01:53:54.332 --> 01:54:00.515]  They have this electronic database system set up where people sign up to be employed.
[01:54:00.515 --> 01:54:03.697]  They also sign up for unemployment.
[01:54:04.241 --> 01:54:07.363]  And they also fill out paperwork as an independent contractor.
[01:54:07.363 --> 01:54:07.724]  That's right.
[01:54:07.724 --> 01:54:11.387]  JPMorgan runs the entire destruction of the economy.
[01:54:11.387 --> 01:54:14.649]  They run everyone signing up to the bureaucracy.
[01:54:14.649 --> 01:54:17.711]  And then they outsource the welfare calls to India.
[01:54:17.711 --> 01:54:21.634]  So you can't even have jobs to administer the welfare calls in America.
[01:54:21.634 --> 01:54:22.475]  What's wrong with that, sir?
[01:54:22.475 --> 01:54:28.479]  Are you racist against the blue JPMorgan Chase symbol?
[01:54:28.479 --> 01:54:30.821]  Because, sir, I don't want to hear racism here.
[01:54:30.821 --> 01:54:32.863]  Any criticism of the establishment is racist.
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:40.586]  I'm just bummed out that they didn't let everybody in on it, because it's a really interesting scheme, because here's what they're doing.
[01:54:40.586 --> 01:55:00.582]  They're hiring people with few enough hours that they can actually report them as unemployed, and they're using their identity, I mean, I'm sorry, they're using their social security numbers to access their unemployment benefit, they launder it through their own account, and give it back to the employees through pay cards, and basically
[01:55:01.161 --> 01:55:10.707]  All of these retailers are paying their part-time employees through the social security funds and... Oh no, that was in AP two weeks ago.
[01:55:10.707 --> 01:55:16.570]  They recommended everybody being laid off under Obamacare to part-time, that they tell the companies how to sign everyone up.
[01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:17.530]  Exactly.
[01:55:17.530 --> 01:55:24.414]  So then the corporations use that as the form of corporate welfare to lower wages to a non-sustainable level.
[01:55:24.414 --> 01:55:25.075]  I think it's great.
[01:55:26.287 --> 01:55:27.688]  And I endorse it.
[01:55:27.688 --> 01:55:29.650]  I love the collapse of America.
[01:55:29.650 --> 01:55:30.690]  I'm trendy.
[01:55:30.690 --> 01:55:31.711]  I support Obama.
[01:55:31.711 --> 01:55:32.432]  I am not racist.
[01:55:32.432 --> 01:55:35.314]  In fact, here's Obama right there.
[01:55:35.314 --> 01:55:37.675]  I mean, he's on screen with us right now.
[01:55:37.675 --> 01:55:38.256]  Oh, leader.
[01:55:38.256 --> 01:55:42.159]  Oh, not Thomas Jefferson.
[01:55:42.159 --> 01:55:44.921]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:55:44.921 --> 01:55:50.165]  If you're watching on TV, they went from Obama, our king, our savior, to the Beelzebub Jefferson.
[01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.070]  I'm really upset right now.
[01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:54.131]  Don't ever put Thomas Jefferson on my screen again.
[01:55:54.131 --> 01:55:55.912]  That racist!
[01:55:55.912 --> 01:55:57.752]  Brad Pitt says it!
[01:55:57.752 --> 01:55:58.372]  It's true!
[01:56:13.919 --> 01:56:14.580]  Deeply racist.
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:15.720]  There you go, I agree.
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:19.343]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Wes and Canada.
[01:56:19.343 --> 01:56:21.845]  I'm against forcibly sterilizing black people in Africa.
[01:56:21.845 --> 01:56:23.967]  I am against black people, folks.
[01:56:23.967 --> 01:56:25.288]  Let's talk to Wes and Canada.
[01:56:25.288 --> 01:56:26.148]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:56:26.148 --> 01:56:29.631]  It is a great honor to be speaking with you, Mr. Jones.
[01:56:29.631 --> 01:56:31.172]  It's an honor to talk to you, my friend.
[01:56:31.172 --> 01:56:36.776]  Now, are you here to worship and bow down and prostrate yourself to the dear leader, Obama?
[01:56:36.776 --> 01:56:36.856]  No.
[01:56:39.278 --> 01:56:49.125]  No, I'm waiting for the day when you're going to impeach him, but actually I wanted to share with you a bit of a story about... We've got one minute.
[01:56:49.125 --> 01:56:50.366]  Share it right now.
[01:56:50.366 --> 01:56:51.787]  Okay, very quickly.
[01:56:51.787 --> 01:56:54.129]  Canadian medicine.
[01:56:54.129 --> 01:56:54.910]  I was born in 1960.
[01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:57.431]  I'm 53 years old.
[01:56:57.431 --> 01:57:00.314]  Healthcare in this country was absolutely phenomenal.
[01:57:00.314 --> 01:57:01.695]  The best in the world.
[01:57:01.695 --> 01:57:02.095]  Absolutely.
[01:57:02.095 --> 01:57:04.397]  Which is racist to point out the statistics, sir.
[01:57:05.277 --> 01:57:08.758]  If you criticize Obamacare, you're racist, please shut up racist.
[01:57:08.758 --> 01:57:16.419]  Right up until the time I was about 22 years old and then the first recession in the 80s hit, which we all felt.
[01:57:16.419 --> 01:57:22.140]  And then hospital beds started closing and care got worse and worse and worse.
[01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:27.981]  It seemed we had excellent toys, but we had very lackluster physicians.
[01:57:27.981 --> 01:57:31.682]  And people kind of became acclimated to that.
[01:57:32.827 --> 01:57:33.307]  That's right.
[01:57:33.307 --> 01:57:34.508]  So now it's going to get even worse.
[01:57:34.508 --> 01:57:39.190]  And if we don't make Obama a dictator, he can't fix the problem he and his masters created.
[01:57:39.190 --> 01:57:39.870]  That's the secret.
[01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:44.112]  Create the crisis off of the solution, and then keep suckering people into more and more control.
[01:57:44.112 --> 01:57:45.073]  God bless you all.
[01:57:45.073 --> 01:57:47.274]  Infowars.com.
[01:57:47.274 --> 01:57:50.135]  The Revolution Against Tyranny is televised and radioed.
