[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:23.030]  I'm here at Eastside Kayak and Tube rental where the City of Austin is threatening to shut down this local business for operating inside of a warehouse instead of a retail establishment and also operating what the City of Austin considers to be unsafe footpaths.
[00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.155]  There are many paths to the water and the path we took was not difficult to navigate as long as you did so with patience.
[00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.631]  This was reported by local news, and according to the owner, he's not aware of any incidents stemming from the footpath.
[00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:40.652]  The owner claims that over 20,000 people have been able to navigate from his shop to the water safely.
[00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:46.873]  So once again, selective enforcement strikes the small business owner while allowing big business to continue to operate.
[00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:55.696]  Thus far, the shop owner has lost over $50,000 from his lack of water access, and this is what we see time and again with big governments working in cahoots with Agenda 21.
[00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:04.378]  Agenda 21 is the action plan to destroy your sovereignty, and that is your personal sovereignty and your national sovereignty.
[00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:13.281]  This is the green mask, the environmental mask, because if you are terrified that you're killing the planet, you will be willing to accept any restriction.
[00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:21.558]  When the shop owner went to court to seek an injunction against the city, he was told by the judge that the judge thought it was a good idea, but the city could operate as they saw fit.
[00:01:22.118 --> 00:01:26.861]  The owner's last hope of staying operable lies in the debate of who actually owns the walkway to the water.
[00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.623]  Unfortunately, the owner is not available for comment.
[00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:32.365]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:35.147]  Have you ever heard of Eastside Kayak and Tube Rentals?
[00:01:36.948 --> 00:01:38.389]  Eastside Kayak and Tube Rentals?
[00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.530]  They're off Red Bluff?
[00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.811]  Yeah, I have.
[00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:42.960]  Well, the reason I ask is the city's trying to shut them down.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.142]  They say they have an unsafe walkway.
[00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:50.507]  I haven't seen, you know, where they're located or what the situation is, but that's too bad.
[00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:55.151]  I mean, you know, I support all the small business owners on Lady Bird Lake.
[00:01:55.532 --> 00:02:01.878]  And they also said they had issue with them operating inside of a warehouse, what the city deems to be a warehouse, instead of a retail establishment.
[00:02:02.078 --> 00:02:02.398]  Really?
[00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.259]  Hmm.
[00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:09.200]  I don't know how you overcome that, but I'm going to go down there and check it out.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:18.048]  We're concerned that, you know, we've heard that some of these larger hotels, they have deals with smaller retails and which is, you know, I guess their business, but we don't want to shut down the mom and pops.
[00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:19.509]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.051]  You know, this town is built on small business.
[00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:28.157]  You know, it kind of thrives on, you know, supporting the small business mom and pop, whether it's a restaurant or what we do.
[00:02:28.277 --> 00:02:28.997]  We're a small business.
[00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:31.840]  We were just voted this last week in the Austin Chronicle.
[00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.811]  The number one water activity in 2013.
[00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:35.091]  Congratulations.
[00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:35.411]  Thank you.
[00:02:35.692 --> 00:02:36.332]  I appreciate that.
[00:02:36.612 --> 00:02:39.233]  President of the Austin Rowing Club is right over here.
[00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:40.754]  Shannon owns the Capital Cruise.
[00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:43.175]  Mike owns Lone Star and everything.
[00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:44.515]  You guys are a pretty tight group.
[00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:45.656]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:51.478]  We're actually all having a meeting next Wednesday about the cabamba plant on the lake and how bad it's been this summer.
[00:02:51.498 --> 00:02:55.420]  It would be a good opportunity for us to talk about what their situation is to maybe help them out.
[00:02:55.902 --> 00:03:03.368]  And if you'd like to learn more about Agenda 21 and how it affects your city, you can stop by the InfoWars shop and pick up a copy of Rosa Corey's Behind the Green Mask.
[00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:05.730]  I'm Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:09.901]  My book, Behind the Green Mask, is a great way to educate yourself.
[00:03:10.141 --> 00:03:12.624]  You want to give this information to your legislators.
[00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:15.027]  Let them know about this if they don't know.
[00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:22.776]  And if they aren't willing to refuse to go along with the federal grants, with the plans, with the projects, then take them out.
[00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.297]  Remove them from office.
[00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:25.619]  And do this locally.
