[00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:11.279]  Now in 2013, the administration continues to push a bullying campaign to go into Syria, and some are calling it a false flag, including Rush Limbaugh and Pat Buchanan.
[00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:16.384]  So we could be looking here at a frame job.
[00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:24.526]  Available data puts the horror in a different and disturbing light, meaning it's not Basher doing the horrible things.
[00:00:25.327 --> 00:00:30.531]  It's the rebels, nerve-gassing themselves, framing Basher, setting him up.
[00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:35.509]  So that the Al-Qaeda guys win, and then we end up on the side of Al-Qaeda, and you've heard that!
[00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.190]  We're getting ourselves into a conflict.
[00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.691]  Iran, Russia, Hezbollah on one side, and us, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, on the other side.
[00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:45.492]  It is insane and it's condemned.
[00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.352]  What do you think of that?
[00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:50.593]  Well, first of all, it's not... The Tonkin Gulf was a made-up incident.
[00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:51.613]  I think this was made up.
[00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.194]  And I don't believe that the... You hear what Pat said?
[00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:55.374]  He thinks this was made up.
[00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:56.535]  I disagree.
[00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:57.295]  I don't believe...
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.703]  Be prepared as they make excuses to take the United States into war.
[00:01:02.423 --> 00:01:03.684]  But it may not be what you think.
[00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:05.706]  It could be cyber attacks.
[00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:09.169]  Cyber terrorism is real and the NSA has proved it.
[00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:13.052]  In fact, they have even self-professed that they've cracked every encryption code.
[00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:19.296]  Digital sabotage could play a significant role in an American military strike if Congress approves an intervention.
[00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:24.700]  Syria's air defenses would likely be among the first targets of any cyber attack, the experts say.
[00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:25.881]  U.S.
[00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:31.585]  forces could trick the Syrians radar system into seeing nothing as American jets pass overhead.
[00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:37.128]  Or the American engineers also could disable Syria's power grid remotely while the intervention was going on.
[00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:44.592]  Last week in Venezuela, the power grid went down and the government is blaming the far right of a rehearsal of an electrical coup.
[00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:49.495]  They have since formed a security and intelligence unit to counter sabotage.
[00:01:50.925 --> 00:02:02.532]  A multinational terror drill is scheduled to take place in the coming months that supposedly aims to access, test, and validate vital infrastructure resources should they come under an unlikely cyber attack.
[00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:05.694]  It's scheduled for November in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
[00:02:05.714 --> 00:02:16.941]  A NERC PowerPoint presentation explains scenarios will have far-reaching application that can exercise the plans and processes of all players, and it will feature prolonged blackout.
[00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:19.323]  Be prepared for a power grid shutdown.
[00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:26.090]  Janet Napolitano was real clear this year that it's not a matter of if it happens, but when it happens.
[00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.471]  Stop the tyranny.
