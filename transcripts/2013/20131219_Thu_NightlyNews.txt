[00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.643]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:24.364]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:28.247]  It's Thursday, December 19th, 2013, and here are our top stories.
[00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:35.972]  Tonight, A&E shoots down a Duck Dynasty star's religious beliefs.
[00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.655]  Then, an incarcerated man is dead.
[00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:42.077]  Was it murder or suicide?
[00:00:42.797 --> 00:00:46.800]  And with record ICE coverage, are carbon credits a good deal?
[00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:50.623]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.213]  Well, the former head of the CIA is now calling for the execution of Snowden by hanging.
[00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:11.658]  Former CIA chief James Woolsey says Snowden should be hanged by the neck until dead if convicted by a jury of his peers.
[00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:20.564]  I guess we should be grateful that he at least puts that caveat in there, that we would at least have a trial by jury for somebody accused of a capital offense like treason.
[00:01:21.482 --> 00:01:23.544]  We don't see that in the FISA courts, of course.
[00:01:23.564 --> 00:01:24.885]  There's no jury.
[00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:26.947]  There's not even an opposing counsel.
[00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:30.091]  And of course, we're not allowed to see what the secretive decisions are.
[00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:34.835]  Let's talk about having a trial by jury for James Clapper for lying to Congress.
[00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:39.180]  Let's talk about a trial by jury for General Keith Alexander for violating the Constitution.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.061]  Let's have a real trial by jury.
[00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.983]  Let's not let these guys get away with this.
[00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:47.406]  He says, I think giving Snowden amnesty would be idiotic.
[00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:51.429]  Well, I think it's idiotic not to prosecute people who openly violate the law.
[00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:54.412]  We're just asking for trouble when we allow this to happen.
[00:01:54.972 --> 00:02:03.899]  Now, of course, talking about hanging him, talking about him being a traitor, takes the attention off of the actual crimes of the NSA, even off of the Snowden documents.
[00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.940]  That's what we really want to focus on.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.901]  Not on Snowden.
[00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:07.962]  Not on Greenwald.
[00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:10.984]  We want to focus, actually, on the NSA.
[00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:12.345]  Not even the Snowden documents.
[00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:22.574]  And that highlights why it's such a dangerous thing for Glenn Greenwald to make it about himself, to make himself the source of these documents, to only release 1% of these.
[00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:27.198]  That's why we're calling for him, that's why I'm calling for him, to release all of the documents.
[00:02:27.258 --> 00:02:33.103]  Greenwald can still do his multi-million dollar media deals if he lets all of the documents out, all the information that he has out.
[00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:34.444]  But here's the dangerous thing.
[00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:51.066]  As Steve Watson pointed out in the article, meanwhile the Obama administration is currently conducting a phony dog and pony show to try to convince us that they're doing something to rein in the NSA, saying that they are going to give the public's right to privacy as well as transparency another look.
[00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:53.007]  This is what's dangerous about this.
[00:02:53.167 --> 00:03:09.711]  Only letting a little bit of this out, keeping back the most damaging, most shocking information, is allowing them to rein this in and to offer this false deal of privacy for security, which is what Max Levkin of PayPal suggested to Charlie Rose back in August.
[00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:17.613]  That is a very dangerous and it's a false choice, because you're not going to have any security if you lose your privacy and you're not going to have any liberty either.
[00:03:17.673 --> 00:03:21.054]  You're simply going to be a slave in the pan-opticon state.
[00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:23.932]  And of course we keep hearing, don't worry if you...
[00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:28.074]  If your information gets out there, if you don't have anything to hide, you shouldn't worry about that.
[00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:34.236]  Well, that's not true, certainly in a privacy setting, and it's also not true for your financial information.
[00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:37.257]  It's also not true even if you don't have anything to hide.
[00:03:37.397 --> 00:03:38.438]  They can change your data.
[00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:40.318]  Look at what they're doing to financial data.
[00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:45.100]  The government is using the NSA to change amounts in bank accounts, warns a panel.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.003]  A White House review panel report, which is a 300-page report prepared for Obama by the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology,
[00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:54.764]  Pointed out two things.
[00:03:54.804 --> 00:04:00.851]  Number one, the governments should not use surveillance to steal industry secrets to advantage their domestic industry.
[00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:01.331]  Hmm.
[00:04:01.611 --> 00:04:06.156]  That's been accused of doing industrial espionage for American companies by many people.
[00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:07.518]  Look at the second thing here.
[00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:16.287]  Governments should not use their offensive cyber capabilities to change amounts held in financial accounts or otherwise manipulate the financial system.
[00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:28.626]  Now, former NSA whistleblower William Binney has stated that, of course, the NSA has a very deep relationship with many financial institutions worldwide, and especially with those like PayPal and credit card companies.
[00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:35.471]  And that would be expected, because the government is watching everyone's financial information to make sure that everybody pays their taxes.
[00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:38.274]  But this is going beyond even that.
[00:04:38.414 --> 00:04:45.860]  This is suggesting that the government is actually going in and not just violating your privacy, but also changing data that's in there.
[00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:49.143]  Now, if other people were to do that, we would call that a crime.
[00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:52.806]  And that's what people are calling it with Target's infiltration.
[00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:56.129]  There's been 40 million credit card accounts that may have been breached.
[00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:00.252]  Of course, it's a crime when it happens at Target and it's not being done by the NSA.
[00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:10.986]  On Thursday, the nation's second largest discounter said that data connected to about 40 million credit and debit card accounts was stolen as part of a breach that began over the Thanksgiving weekend.
[00:05:12.193 --> 00:05:17.857]  45.7 million credit and debit card users were exposed to credit card fraud, according to them.
[00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:24.962]  And there's talk about how this is really going to hurt the company financially, because it destroys confidence in the company.
[00:05:25.342 --> 00:05:27.323]  And of course, that's what's happening in America.
[00:05:27.523 --> 00:05:31.266]  It's destroying confidence in the American government, if anybody has any left.
[00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:39.131]  But it's also even damaging American companies, because people around the world are assuming that American companies are totally in bed with the NSA.
[00:05:39.632 --> 00:05:42.660]  That's why we need to rein this in and get back to the Constitution.
[00:05:43.463 --> 00:05:46.010]  Now in other news, hell freezes over today.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.240]  Literally.
[00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:52.945]  This is the hell of global warming, global carbon taxes, and Agenda 21.
[00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:59.569]  But Al Gore predicted that by 2013, we would no longer have any ice in the Arctic.
[00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:06.855]  This is pointed out by Alex Newman from New American going back in his Wayback Machine and saying that Al Gore forecasted an ice-free Arctic by 2013.
[00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:11.378]  However, the ice cover has actually expanded by 50%.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:26.423]  He says, in 2007, 2008, 2009, Gore publicly and very hysterically warned that the North Pole would be ice-free by around 2013 because of alleged man-made global warming.
[00:06:26.484 --> 00:06:31.665]  Not even global warming from the sun, but things that you and I have to stop, like carbon dioxide.
[00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:38.427]  And of course, this was put out by the BBC in an article called, The Arctic Summer's Ice-Free by 2013.
[00:06:39.807 --> 00:06:41.948]  So there's a lot of alarmists that are involved in this.
[00:06:41.988 --> 00:06:42.348]  Now remember,
[00:06:42.968 --> 00:06:48.790]  Al Gore's inconvenient truth was in 2006, or as many people more accurately called it, a convenient lie.
[00:06:49.351 --> 00:06:58.474]  To put this in perspective, by 2009, the East Anglia University in the United Kingdom was caught up in a climate gate scandal.
[00:06:59.014 --> 00:07:08.818]  A lot of emails were released on a Russian server showing that over a thousand emails they were conspiring to hide the decline in temperatures.
[00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:12.439]  Passing back information to each other saying hide the decline.
[00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.360]  This was a real conspiracy.
[00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:23.965]  It was people working together to concoct a lie and to change policy, government policy, and of course that's illegal.
[00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:26.507]  That's by very definition what a conspiracy is.
[00:07:27.187 --> 00:07:29.728]  It was followed up because it didn't get that much press coverage.
[00:07:29.748 --> 00:07:31.409]  We did cover it here at InfoWars.
[00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:34.010]  Alex Jones covered it, broke it down right as it happened back in 2009.
[00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:45.424]  Two years later, to the date in 2011, another 5,000 emails were leaked showing that they were conspiring in great detail to hide this decline.
[00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:46.826]  They knew it was declining.
[00:07:47.226 --> 00:07:51.291]  And yet you have scientists like Michael Mann, who at the time was at the University of Virginia,
[00:07:52.032 --> 00:08:14.623]  Coming up with the hockey stick, which was used by Al Gore quite a bit in his documentary, to convince people that we were headed for an exponential increase in global temperatures, we had to take radical action, we had to make radical changes to our economy, to society, and we had to create a global tax which we would pay to people like Al Gore.
[00:08:15.836 --> 00:08:22.402]  Well, Democrats are now persecuting homeschooling parents, or at least proposing that they will, in Ohio.
[00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:40.838]  We see a new, very dangerous piece of legislation put out by a state senator, which would require homeschooling parents to be licensed by the state through an application process, which would include investigation, background checks, in-person interviews between social workers and children, which the parents would not be allowed to attend.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.840]  And if you pass all that scrutiny, then you're allowed to teach your children.
[00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:49.508]  That is guilty until proven innocent.
[00:08:50.049 --> 00:08:57.375]  And if we accept that kind of oversight, how much longer will it be before we have social workers approving us to even become parents?
[00:08:57.956 --> 00:09:00.198]  This is so upside down in America now.
[00:09:00.218 --> 00:09:12.189]  This is all being predicated as if it was going to address a particularly bad child abuse case that was in Ohio, and the child was a homeschooled child, but there were many people
[00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:13.150]  We're good to go.
[00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:34.489]  I think.
[00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:59.308]  Lost both times and then when a vacancy came up was appointed to the office and then immediately put into a leadership position.
[00:09:59.588 --> 00:10:03.151]  So this is somebody who is very well connected within the Democrat Party.
[00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:07.054]  So this is something that is more than just the crazy idea of one legislator.
[00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:08.756]  We should be very concerned about that.
[00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:18.563]  Now the very same state that wants to get prior approval for people homeschooling their children wants to look the other way when there's a case of murder by the police.
[00:10:19.502 --> 00:10:22.223]  This is a story from Mikhail Thelin.
[00:10:22.243 --> 00:10:22.923]  He says,
[00:10:37.133 --> 00:10:39.194]  Almost talking about how they're going to kill this guy.
[00:10:39.414 --> 00:10:40.394]  He tried to escape.
[00:10:40.494 --> 00:10:41.195]  He attacked them.
[00:10:41.255 --> 00:10:42.035]  They got him on the ground.
[00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:44.376]  They said, I'm going to break your effing neck right now.
[00:10:44.396 --> 00:10:48.817]  And another one says, when we get back to the jail, we'll have a welcome party for him tonight.
[00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:54.319]  Now, that was not even an hour before he was found dead in the jail cell.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:03.523]  And what they did when they took him back to the jail was they removed all of his clothing, gave him paper clothes, and yet somehow they didn't notice a sheet which was used to hang him.
[00:11:04.043 --> 00:11:13.127]  When the coroner looked at the case, the coroner said that there was absolutely no way, with the furniture that was in the jail cell, that he could actually hang himself.
[00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:23.290]  So it's a very troubling situation there, and of course the police captain is saying that there's no crime, move along, there's nothing to see here, I'm sure it's just politically motivated.
[00:11:23.931 --> 00:11:24.651]  I don't think so.
[00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:48.283]  Now, I'm sure by now you've probably heard about what's happened with Duck Dynasty, the scandal that's broken there, where he came out and talked about homosexual relationships, heterosexual relationships, what he thought was sin, read a quote from the Bible, highly offensive to those people at A&E, and he was put on hiatus, indefinite, I think it's, at this time they're talking about it being permanent.
[00:11:49.044 --> 00:11:52.906]  I think this just goes to show how, even though this is the number one cable
[00:11:53.703 --> 00:12:00.029]  The media networks are not reflecting the values of the community, but they are trying to instill the values of the community.
[00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:03.492]  This is the commentary that Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said.
[00:12:03.532 --> 00:12:09.737]  He said, this is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh and Phil Robertson gets suspended.
[00:12:10.157 --> 00:12:12.920]  He says, I remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.582]  Well, of course, the First Amendment is about freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.
[00:12:17.602 --> 00:12:24.924]  But remember back to April of 2013, when the same guy said that he was stopped by A&E from praying in the name of Jesus?
[00:12:25.425 --> 00:12:29.166]  Of course, they have no problem if somebody swears using the name of Jesus.
[00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:31.067]  We'll be right back after the break.
[00:12:31.107 --> 00:12:38.850]  Jakari Jackson will have a report about the IRS, and he's also going to have an interview with former criminal investigative agent for the IRS, Joe Bannister.
[00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:39.450]  Stay tuned.
[00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.454]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:55.017]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:12:55.337 --> 00:13:05.027]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:13.569]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:16.310]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.971]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:13:21.351 --> 00:13:22.231]  We are the spirit of 1776.

[00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:31.293]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:13:31.593 --> 00:13:35.777]  In the long march towards humanity's ultimate destiny of freedom.

[00:14:01.653 --> 00:14:09.896]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:14:10.056 --> 00:14:14.758]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:21.341]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:14:21.721 --> 00:14:28.806]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:14:28.886 --> 00:14:35.771]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:14:35.911 --> 00:14:40.275]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:43.617]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[00:14:50.084 --> 00:14:52.266]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[00:14:56.471 --> 00:14:57.311]  The facts are in.
[00:14:57.491 --> 00:14:58.632]  The studies are legion.
[00:14:58.892 --> 00:15:06.255]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:15:06.415 --> 00:15:09.876]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:15:10.237 --> 00:15:10.637]  Simple.
[00:15:10.817 --> 00:15:15.219]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:20.961]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:15:21.241 --> 00:15:26.607]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[00:15:26.788 --> 00:15:37.260]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:37.980]  Welcome back.
[00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:08.225]  Now it's important to remember that the income tax began with a very small tax on the very, very wealthy.
[00:16:08.245 --> 00:16:10.949]  The people accepted that, and now look at what we've got.
[00:16:10.989 --> 00:16:12.371]  Jakari Jackson has that report.
[00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:22.251]  The IRS, the agency who likes to use conservative groups for target practice, is back in the news once again.
[00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:27.113]  IRS vendor owed $525 million in back taxes.
[00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:34.896]  This article points out how over 1,200 vendors owe back taxes who work with the IRS, including one contractor who owes
[00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:37.277]  525 million.
[00:16:37.557 --> 00:16:38.817]  And that's just fine.
[00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:47.540]  Because as you recall, former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner didn't pay Social Security or Medicare taxes during his stint at the International Monetary Fund.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.600]  But he isn't alone.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:54.322]  Because you recall, 36 Obama aides owe over $800,000 in back taxes.
[00:16:54.682 --> 00:16:56.623]  And what about this one from earlier this year?
[00:16:57.003 --> 00:17:00.804]  Thousands of new IRS agents hired to enforce Obamacare.
[00:17:01.284 --> 00:17:08.209]  But as it turns out, the IRS, one of the agencies involved in policing Obamacare, wants to be immune from Obamacare itself.
[00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:09.650]  Oh, the irony!
[00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.872]  IRS agents beg to be out of Obamacare.
[00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:24.641]  And let us not forget, Obama and the IRS, the smoking gun, President met with anti-Tea Party IRS Union Chief the day before the agency targeted the Tea Party.
[00:17:25.663 --> 00:17:35.089]  And despite her testimony trying not to implicate herself, Lois Lerner's emails reveal that she at least knew about the targeting of conservative groups before she took the stand.
[00:17:35.489 --> 00:17:38.251]  The targeting wasn't limited to political affiliations.
[00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:41.213]  They also targeted Christians and other conservative groups.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:49.922]  The IRS can target you for your religious affiliations, they can target you for your political affiliations, or if you just flat out don't like Obamacare.
[00:17:50.242 --> 00:17:51.903]  And what are they going to target you with?
[00:17:52.283 --> 00:17:54.183]  Of course, the AR-15 rifle.
[00:17:54.403 --> 00:18:00.645]  The highly publicized but statistically rarely used rifle that has gained such international media attention.
[00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:08.027]  Check InfoWars.com for more updates and to learn how the IRS isn't the only agency that has you in its sights.
[00:18:17.947 --> 00:18:21.612]  And as an update, today we learned that Facebook will be paying no income taxes.
[00:18:21.672 --> 00:18:23.434]  As a matter of fact, they'll get money back.
[00:18:24.034 --> 00:18:25.136]  Well, stay tuned right after the break.
[00:18:25.176 --> 00:18:29.561]  Jakari Jackson is going to be talking to Joe Bannister, former IRS criminal investigator.
[00:18:29.621 --> 00:18:30.102]  Stay tuned.
[00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:40.317]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:18:40.538 --> 00:18:47.767]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:51.171]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:53.034]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:18:53.294 --> 00:18:57.857]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:18:57.937 --> 00:19:00.698]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:06.641]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:10.303]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:15.546]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[00:19:18.968 --> 00:19:24.836]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:19:24.936 --> 00:19:26.939]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:19:38.399 --> 00:19:39.119]  And welcome back.
[00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:46.002]  With the IRS hosting vendors who don't even pay their income taxes, it makes you wonder how they plan to enforce Obamacare.
[00:19:46.442 --> 00:19:50.063]  Former IRS agent Joe Bannister joins us to talk about just that issue.
[00:19:50.344 --> 00:19:51.284]  Thanks for joining us, Joe.
[00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:53.476]  Thank you, Jakari.
[00:19:53.516 --> 00:19:54.197]  Thank you for having me.
[00:19:54.597 --> 00:19:54.817]  Yes.
[00:19:55.217 --> 00:19:57.398]  Now, we had this article come out a couple days ago.
[00:19:57.418 --> 00:20:03.081]  It says, report IRS vendor owed $525 million in back taxes.
[00:20:03.561 --> 00:20:05.282]  Now, Joe, what's the deal?
[00:20:05.362 --> 00:20:06.623]  This is just one of the vendors.
[00:20:06.663 --> 00:20:08.904]  There were over 1,200 from my understanding.
[00:20:09.324 --> 00:20:10.324]  Excuse me, yeah, about 1,200.
[00:20:11.485 --> 00:20:15.567]  And why is it okay for these IRS vendors not to pay their back taxes?
[00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.514]  Well, Jakari, the problem is that there's a double standard and there always has been.
[00:20:22.595 --> 00:20:38.170]  Throughout the decades, at least certainly that I've been paying attention, there's many people in Congress that don't pay the income tax or cheat on it, many IRS employees and government employees, and certainly government contractors as well.
[00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:41.293]  There's a lot of people in government that just look the other way.
[00:20:42.394 --> 00:20:45.036]  Except for one group, and that's people like you and me.
[00:20:46.016 --> 00:20:50.038]  If we don't have connections, we can be assured of getting hammered.
[00:20:51.599 --> 00:21:00.543]  So, you know, these things come up and they basically are just the tip of the iceberg, but generally the American people kind of yawn, you know, collectively.
[00:21:00.583 --> 00:21:04.646]  I mean, many of us scream bloody murder when this happens.
[00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:14.225]  Unfortunately, the American people yawn and vote the same politicians in and let the same contractors be worked with.
[00:21:15.286 --> 00:21:21.690]  We've seen Tim Geithner, he didn't pay his taxes for a good while, as well as many of Obama's aides themselves.
[00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.892]  They just didn't get around to paying their taxes.
[00:21:24.898 --> 00:21:29.482]  Right, and their constituents could care less, and so it's just business as usual.
[00:21:29.502 --> 00:21:40.571]  That's kind of what you guys do there, and what I do is try to get people to wake up and care about getting screwed in this manner.
[00:21:41.132 --> 00:21:41.592]  Exactly.
[00:21:41.912 --> 00:21:48.017]  Now, Joe, since the last time we've had you on the show, we've had a lot of new developments with the IRS, the lowest learner situation.
[00:21:48.037 --> 00:21:49.238]  Let's talk briefly about that.
[00:21:49.278 --> 00:21:52.021]  What do you think about her testimony and her decision to step down?
[00:21:53.719 --> 00:22:13.223]  Well, you know, the great thing for them is that they are well cushioned in terms of their careers and maybe her reputation isn't so great, but I think somehow that nice plump tension will help her to forget all the difficulties that she had.
[00:22:14.823 --> 00:22:20.784]  It's business as usual with the politicians and who they appoint, you know, the Obama administration.
[00:22:21.504 --> 00:22:28.907]  And who they appoint, they're all their cronies, so that they can go about doing their dirty business, going after their opposition.
[00:22:29.487 --> 00:22:32.768]  And they need people like Lois Lerner to help them do that.
[00:22:32.888 --> 00:22:43.752]  Because, you know, Obama's not going to put on a badge and a gun and go knock down your door, or forbid you from participating in the political process, but somebody like Lois Lerner can.
[00:22:43.872 --> 00:22:49.094]  And she had a track record of doing so, so Obama knew that she was the woman for him.
[00:22:49.734 --> 00:22:50.194]  Exactly.
[00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:53.997]  Now, we've seen them target Tea Party groups, conservative Christian groups.
[00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:55.778]  I mean, how does this come about?
[00:22:55.818 --> 00:23:03.062]  How does this, you know, we know it's not okay if they do this, but how does it even get in the thought process that, yes, we can do this and we'll do it until we get away?
[00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:05.143]  Do you have any idea how they come up with this stuff?
[00:23:06.601 --> 00:23:18.397]  Well, I think the first problem is the mentality of the American people, thinking that they have to have a permission slip from the Obama administration to engage in political activity.
[00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:21.842]  Newsflash, you know, there's something called the First Amendment.
[00:23:22.022 --> 00:23:22.423]  Exactly.
[00:23:23.624 --> 00:23:25.026]  That's our permission slip.
[00:23:25.286 --> 00:23:31.393]  So, you know, I think, I hope more Americans will educate themselves about these processes that are abused.
[00:23:31.954 --> 00:23:36.378]  But many times people don't even need to go down, go through the process.
[00:23:36.479 --> 00:23:43.827]  They can simply exercise their First Amendment right and not wait for government permission to do something they don't need permission to do.
[00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:45.771]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:23:45.811 --> 00:23:50.815]  Now we're coming up on the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve.
[00:23:51.576 --> 00:23:55.359]  In 100 years, Joe, you're very educated in the IRS.
[00:23:55.879 --> 00:23:58.522]  What have we gained, if anything, from the Federal Reserve System?
[00:24:00.098 --> 00:24:02.440]  Well, the American people haven't gained much.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.342]  I think they've lost, they're losing everything.
[00:24:05.903 --> 00:24:17.832]  And I don't know if people realize that the federal income tax and the Federal Reserve Act were passed in the same year, 1913, and it is the 100th anniversary of both the income tax and the Federal Reserve.
[00:24:18.312 --> 00:24:21.175]  And it wasn't a coincidence that both of them were
[00:24:21.955 --> 00:24:50.081]  uh... passed in nineteen thirteen because the income tax is is part and parcel of the federal reserve system one can't work without the other uh... and of course the the byproduct of the little special ingredients of the income tax is the control surveillance and uh... you know dumbing down and domestication of the american people and so the federal government had a hundred years to get this in place and so the obama care
[00:24:51.221 --> 00:24:51.822]  I don't know.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.160]  Now, Joe, let's get back to Obamacare.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.421]  You touched on it briefly for a second there.
[00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:22.844]  We see people being kicked off their plans, the lies coming out, that first that you could keep your doctor and now you can't keep your doctor, and just the lies keep compounding and saying that they didn't target various groups and now they're going to target various groups, people are forced to get married and so forth.
[00:25:22.864 --> 00:25:24.484]  There's a lot of things that go on with this.
[00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:25.485]  Just your thoughts.
[00:25:25.585 --> 00:25:27.245]  What are your thoughts about Obamacare?
[00:25:29.215 --> 00:25:34.338]  Well, it's another boondoggle, and unfortunately there aren't enough Americans.
[00:25:34.638 --> 00:25:36.579]  We know that the politicians don't read the bill.
[00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:38.701]  You can ask Nancy Pelosi.
[00:25:38.881 --> 00:25:41.202]  She waits to pass it before she reads it.
[00:25:41.783 --> 00:25:45.645]  And so if she's not reading the bills, more than likely most of the American people aren't.
[00:25:46.025 --> 00:25:51.749]  I think there's a lot of, like Infowars, all of you guys and gals, there are people who are
[00:25:52.685 --> 00:26:00.170]  You know, doing the hard work and pointing out the problems with these legislations, NDAA and Obamacare.
[00:26:01.271 --> 00:26:14.420]  The problem is that we need more Americans rowing the boat with us to pay attention, to scream bloody murder, as you guys were instrumental in stopping the Syrian invasion, right?
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.402]  We reported on a lot of that stuff, yeah.
[00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:23.976]  Right, so we have the power, we just need to exercise it, and we need a whole lot more people in the boat helping us to run.
[00:26:24.356 --> 00:26:30.181]  I'm glad you brought that up, because people always say, you know, you guys, you bring up these points, and they're good points, they're valid points, but what do we do?
[00:26:30.241 --> 00:26:33.384]  What do we do, Joe Bannister, to fight off Obamacare?
[00:26:33.424 --> 00:26:34.705]  What do we do to fight off the IRS?
[00:26:36.881 --> 00:26:41.644]  Well, the deadlines are fast approaching.
[00:26:41.664 --> 00:26:48.189]  You know, I think there's like a December 23rd deadline, federal deadline, to make a choice of your health care.
[00:26:48.709 --> 00:26:56.014]  And then you have to pay premiums by January 1st and certain health care providers are allowing a few day grace period.
[00:26:57.415 --> 00:27:06.401]  If anyone has been procrastinating to find out what their options are going to be and what dangers to their privacy are going to exist,
[00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:15.406]  I suggest that at least this year, in 2014, worst case scenario is a $95 penalty if they even find you.
[00:27:17.087 --> 00:27:20.648]  But after 2014, the penalties start to ramp up.
[00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:24.230]  The dangers to our privacy are already there.
[00:27:24.711 --> 00:27:26.752]  If you give your information to anyone,
[00:27:27.492 --> 00:27:29.033]  It doesn't matter if they're the IRS or not.
[00:27:29.233 --> 00:27:33.474]  Any insurance company, it's going to be passed along to the IRS.
[00:27:33.554 --> 00:27:43.358]  You better look at those early lines in the sand, because if you cross those, you may very well find yourself with a letter from the IRS or a phone call.
[00:27:43.618 --> 00:27:44.359]  And it's not only that.
[00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:45.699]  We've seen these sites being hacked.
[00:27:45.739 --> 00:27:47.260]  They're very unsecure.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:54.723]  We've heard these fake teledialers and internet insurers getting these people's information under fraudulent terms.
[00:27:56.232 --> 00:27:56.732]  Absolutely.
[00:27:56.812 --> 00:28:00.215]  I mean, the dangers to your privacy aren't just from the government.
[00:28:01.396 --> 00:28:14.624]  But, you know, I think there was a recent story about the couple, the woman who was expecting the premium to be deducted from her bank account two months later, but the deduction happened two months earlier.
[00:28:14.644 --> 00:28:18.087]  And, you know, lo and behold, their cash flow couldn't handle
[00:28:18.787 --> 00:28:42.872]  You know like an 800 or $1,000 ding to their bank account, so this is what happens when you let other people Into your life in this manner, and I'm not saying it's easy But you really have to watch out who you give your information to and some website that seems harmless could be the beginning of the end for your privacy and your bank accounts and everything and
[00:28:43.132 --> 00:28:52.605]  Exactly, and we've talked to John McAfee of McAfee Antivirus Software, and he said, you know, I'm not going to work on this healthcare site, even though he was invited to, because this thing is busted and tore down to begin with.
[00:28:52.945 --> 00:28:58.713]  Now, Joe Bannister, we've come to the end of our interview, so please give us your final thoughts and also tell us how we can keep up with you.

[00:29:06.422 --> 00:29:13.366]  As far as alternatives to Obamacare, you might look into the health-sharing organizations that are out there.
[00:29:13.466 --> 00:29:14.587]  That's another alternative.
[00:29:16.268 --> 00:29:22.612]  So, you know, agentfortruth.com, and I really appreciate everything that Everybody Infowars is doing, and we just got to keep on fighting.
