[00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:11.819]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:13.381]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:17.066]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.203]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide Sunday edition.
[00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:41.247]  We are going to be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:41.247 --> 00:00:49.131]  Central Standard Time and of course I also come back weekdays 11 a.m.
[00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:50.031]  to 2 p.m.
[00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:52.112]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:54.315 --> 00:01:05.543]  Coming up today, I really want to talk with the listeners about the lawlessness of the system and where it's going.
[00:01:05.543 --> 00:01:19.933]  And whereas the establishment state-run media tries to behave like anyone that questions the official system is a kook, the truth is Congress now has a 6% approval rating.
[00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.036]  That's the latest numbers.
[00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:28.056]  Coming out from Gallup.
[00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:29.557]  6% approval rating.
[00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:32.259]  The president's approval rating is dropping like a rock.
[00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:39.504]  And the general public has the least amount of trust ever recorded in the history of modern polling for each other.
[00:01:39.504 --> 00:01:44.208]  And I think that that's well-founded.
[00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:51.434]  The problem is you can trust individuals and even organizations, from my own research, a lot more than you can trust the government.
[00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.709]  And the Fortune 100 or so.
[00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:05.176]  These are purely, purely predatory groups who pride themselves on their deceptiveness.
[00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:18.447]  Who pride themselves on their absolute total attack on humanity.
[00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:21.770]  And so we're going to be breaking all of that down today.
[00:02:23.186 --> 00:02:26.607]  Coming up after the first break.
[00:02:26.607 --> 00:02:32.308]  And I want to talk about the problems in society and the lawlessness of the power structure.
[00:02:32.308 --> 00:02:39.871]  But then I also want to speak to the subject of real solutions.
[00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:48.493]  And there certainly are a lot of real, real solutions out there that certainly
[00:02:50.407 --> 00:03:05.258]  Can be deployed, but the biggest solution is simply getting the public to become aware of how the real world works and who the real players are in this world.
[00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:08.340]  So when we go to break, we're going to come back and cover
[00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:33.276]  All of that we have a one minute break coming up and then we will come back and get into also some of the latest news for dead more than 60 injured New York City train derail nightmare dead at 40 the fiery car crash he wasn't driving with a friend in a Porsche Carrera GT quarterly round of road at high speeds ran to a pole and blew up
[00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.742]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[00:03:35.742 --> 00:03:37.684]  Of course, the really important news.
[00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:41.209]  China flies fighter jets into disputed air defense zone.
[00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.672]  Japan remains defiant.
[00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:47.398]  This could really kick off into a wider war with both groups threatening to attack each other.
[00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:48.740]  South Korea flying aircraft in.
[00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:56.861]  Over in England, the London Guardian is being targeted by the government for reporting on the criminal activities of the U.S.
[00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.702]  government and the NSA.
[00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:01.023]  That is going to be coming up.
[00:04:01.023 --> 00:04:05.926]  We're also going to get into pressure building on Boehner for an NSA vote.
[00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:12.830]  Meanwhile, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the adjunct have come out and said, hey, get rid of the Constitution.
[00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.590]  Whole cloth.
[00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.832]  That is coming up today as well.
[00:04:16.832 --> 00:04:19.374]  But again, the big issue is I want to focus in
[00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:23.836]  I want to focus in on the manipulation.
[00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:33.400]  I want to focus in on the outright deception that is taking place.
[00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.737]  And what the fundamental mindset and worldview is of the controllers.
[00:04:43.737 --> 00:04:52.186]  All this and more coming up straight ahead on this worldwide broadcast on this Sunday.
[00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:56.130]  Again, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:04:58.635 --> 00:05:03.362]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:05:03.362 --> 00:05:06.486]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:12.054]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:05:12.054 --> 00:05:13.657]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:15.618]  We are what we eat.
[00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:20.281]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:24.503]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:27.065]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:33.288]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:05:43.314 --> 00:05:49.359]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.971]  In the councils of government,
[00:06:07.722 --> 00:06:16.850]  We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.755]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:28.821]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.363]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:31.363 --> 00:06:32.364]  A new world order.
[00:06:36.093 --> 00:06:39.016]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:42.940]  It just pancaked.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.764]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:06:59.872 --> 00:07:05.538]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:10.756]  Guns will be taken.
[00:07:10.756 --> 00:07:11.757]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:13.718]  We're going to take all of them.
[00:07:13.718 --> 00:07:18.562]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:20.123]  Global governance at last.
[00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:21.104]  Is it one world?
[00:07:21.104 --> 00:07:22.785]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:26.388]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:07:26.388 --> 00:07:32.673]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:07:32.673 --> 00:07:37.337]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:40.086 --> 00:07:49.852]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live December 1st, 2013 worldwide broadcast.
[00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:52.473]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:52.473 --> 00:07:53.294]  Central Time.
[00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:55.695]  Back weekdays, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:57.416]  Eastern, 11 a.m.
[00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:57.976]  to 2 p.m.
[00:07:57.976 --> 00:07:59.637]  Central Standard Time.
[00:07:59.637 --> 00:08:00.618]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:08:01.954 --> 00:08:10.864]  I am going to go over all of the top stories here, just to give you an idea of some of the things that I'm looking at on my desk.
[00:08:10.864 --> 00:08:19.272]  And then I want to get into a very dangerous precedent that's being set, not just here, but all over the world under continuity of agenda.
[00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:28.854]  By major corporations and government think tanks developing a program of absolute tyranny against humanity.
[00:08:28.854 --> 00:08:39.097]  A revolution against the Renaissance, against the Enlightenment, against common law, and against really a thousand years of European war.
[00:08:42.403 --> 00:09:02.834]  The Magna Carta is one of the most famous signposts in 1215 to deliver to the people some of the basic checks and balances that have taken a thousand years, a thousand years to get codified into common law are all being erased worldwide.
[00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:08.177]  The West was the example of law and justice and prosperity.
[00:09:08.177 --> 00:09:09.458]  Not that the West was perfect, but
[00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:13.148]  Compared to other nations, it was the highest standard.
[00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:19.793]  Now, the West has been captured by the globalists and is now an engine of evil worldwide.
[00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:33.883]  And the abolishment of the family, of private property, of due process, of all the checks and balances that really form the atmosphere of a free society, is all being sucked into space right now.
[00:09:34.844 --> 00:09:37.826]  We are depressurizing as a society.
[00:09:37.826 --> 00:09:39.106]  The shields are down.
[00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:41.808]  The walls are now down on every front.
[00:09:41.808 --> 00:09:50.993]  We are now on fire, burning to the ground, if you need a political parallel or parable or analogy.
[00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:58.077]  And whenever I take off a few days, and I took off two full days, which is a long vacation for me.
[00:09:58.077 --> 00:10:02.219]  I only worked half a day the other days, Tuesday through today.
[00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:24.990]  I really have time to pull back from the news and pull back from just all the clutter and all the information and just really get freaked out every time I take off a few days and pull back and realize, wow, this is really happening.
[00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.851]  We have been absolutely on target and absolutely
[00:10:29.073 --> 00:10:36.961]  Accurate, and the only places that were not accurate is in the fact that things are much worse than we've said.
[00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:49.672]  And then I see the general public, on average, aware that they're being lied to, aware that the system is predatory, but really not having any idea how deep the water is.
[00:10:49.672 --> 00:10:51.014]  Folks know they're wet.
[00:10:52.025 --> 00:11:01.387]  They're bathed in corruption, bathed in manipulation, bathed in corporate and government discrimination against the common serfs.
[00:11:01.387 --> 00:11:09.549]  The population knows that they're literally being drowned in propaganda and social engineering, but they don't know what's swimming in the water.
[00:11:09.549 --> 00:11:11.570]  They don't know how deep it is.
[00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:19.892]  I have tried to plumb the depths and only find entire new civilizations of evil beneath the depths.
[00:11:20.885 --> 00:11:21.805]  Beneath the waves.
[00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:44.216]  I mean it is just a whole universe of corruption and fraud and scams and it's only possible because the free market produced so much wealth and so much freedom and so many choices that it almost gives the evil, well it doesn't almost, it does, places to hide.
[00:11:44.216 --> 00:11:46.477]  To hide behind the prosperity.
[00:11:46.477 --> 00:11:47.438]  But now it's only
[00:11:48.911 --> 00:11:51.252]  Facades of prosperity.
[00:11:51.252 --> 00:12:02.717]  And every historical, every economic indicator, every cultural indicator shows we are basically going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:12:02.717 --> 00:12:07.879]  They've got a Nobel Prize winner in economics coming out saying the stock market's going to melt down and implode.
[00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:10.540]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.542]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that inflation is just off the chart.
[00:12:15.532 --> 00:12:42.492]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that there is massive social engineering going on and it is pointed at the individual and it is designed to wreck checks and balances and civilization and the fruits of the New World Order
[00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:49.051]  Are everything nasty and stinking and horrible you could ever imagine?
[00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:57.742]  Now, I want to read some of the headlines out to you here, and then I want to come back and talk about the revolution of tyranny that's taking place, why there's a revolution of tyranny.
[00:12:57.742 --> 00:12:58.944]  I really want to crystallize this.
[00:13:02.225 --> 00:13:17.411]  And then we're going to open the phones up to get your take on solutions and ways to counter this and what you think the next year and the next decade and the next 20 years, the next 100 years has in store for humanity.
[00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:24.914]  Because we really should, as a culture, as a species, have a discussion about where humanity is going.
[00:13:27.594 --> 00:13:33.820]  I'll assure you the establishment is not concerned with Xbox Connect or the NFL.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:39.365]  I will assure you the establishment is not concerned with the latest fashions.
[00:13:39.365 --> 00:13:44.270]  I will assure you the establishment is not concerned with all of the fake
[00:13:45.376 --> 00:13:54.143]  Projections they put out to create an artificial habitat, an artificial culture of death to make sure you never realize what's really going on.
[00:13:54.143 --> 00:14:00.087]  Oh, I mean, they're interested in the NFL and fashion and culture as a weapon.
[00:14:00.087 --> 00:14:01.769]  They designed it.
[00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:02.970]  They decide what's popular.
[00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.993]  They decide what to put out front in front of people.
[00:14:06.993 --> 00:14:09.315]  They decide how to best screw you up and confuse you.
[00:14:10.037 --> 00:14:16.600]  But when it comes to what they're really into, they run like the plague from everything they produce.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.120]  GMO.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.161]  Aspartame.
[00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:21.261]  The additives.
[00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:22.422]  Fluoride.
[00:14:22.422 --> 00:14:30.625]  The globalists all on record are obsessed with not being around any of it.
[00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:33.306]  They don't put their children in the government training camps we dumbed down.
[00:14:34.927 --> 00:14:43.552]  Everything they tell you to do, that they put out there on television as the role model of success, is designed to fundamentally destroy you.
[00:14:43.552 --> 00:14:46.253]  It's like telling a two-year-old, go run around in traffic.
[00:14:46.253 --> 00:14:51.276]  That's where you'll find the Lucky Charms leprechaun in the pot of gold.
[00:14:51.276 --> 00:14:54.237]  A two-year-old would believe you and walk out into traffic.
[00:14:54.237 --> 00:14:56.018]  And that's how I see the general public.
[00:14:56.018 --> 00:14:59.420]  And I'm supposed to be a predator and go, well, I'm going to join the elite.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.161]  The public are a bunch of ugly, dumb,
[00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:13.707]  Stupid morons, who themselves are a bunch of backstabbing rats on average, who would tear my throat out if they could, with exponential envy, so why don't I join the vampire class and feed on them?
[00:15:13.707 --> 00:15:18.149]  They're prey animals, that's what they're made for!
[00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:24.653]  But I will not do that, because I've seen what the establishment's all about, and their fate's even worse than the cattle's fate!
[00:15:25.578 --> 00:15:27.500]  But I want to tell the cattle something.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.505]  The new listeners out there, you are scientifically targeted.
[00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:35.049]  And you can live in your own little bubble of denial about this all day.
[00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:40.476]  But if you want to turn things around, you're going to have to wake up to the fact you're under attack, number one.
[00:15:41.434 --> 00:15:44.158]  And the fact that things are about to get a lot worse, number two.
[00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:47.502]  And that there's no hope in beating this by laying down.
[00:15:47.502 --> 00:15:54.252]  The only hope is admitting it, getting up on your hind legs and realizing you're in a war whether you admit it or not.
[00:15:54.252 --> 00:15:56.795]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:15:56.795 --> 00:15:57.737]  The headline's coming up.
[00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:06.831]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:09.312]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:16:09.312 --> 00:16:09.672]  The U.S.
[00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:13.894]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:16:13.894 --> 00:16:16.875]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.355]  They want that attack to come.
[00:16:18.355 --> 00:16:24.578]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:27.591]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:32.576]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:40.002]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:16:40.322 --> 00:16:43.086]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:46.169]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:16:46.169 --> 00:16:50.735]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[00:16:50.735 --> 00:16:55.340]  Available only at InfoWarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:16:59.329 --> 00:17:09.996]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:12.078]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:17:12.078 --> 00:17:12.938]  Fluoride!
[00:17:12.938 --> 00:17:14.879]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:17:14.879 --> 00:17:21.464]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:17:21.464 --> 00:17:26.367]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:17:26.367 --> 00:17:29.069]  Reports documented of 15-point IQ increase.
[00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:30.069]  We're good to go!
[00:17:59.315 --> 00:18:01.197]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:18:01.197 --> 00:18:04.859]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:09.383]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:18:09.383 --> 00:18:15.508]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:18:15.508 --> 00:18:26.297]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:18:26.497 --> 00:18:29.358]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:32.980]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:49.928]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:18:50.228 --> 00:18:55.630]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.990]  And my research led me to a well-known fact.
[00:19:08.954 --> 00:19:24.285]  That most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:19:24.285 --> 00:19:30.470]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Youngevity.
[00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:38.296]  The Youngevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:19:38.616 --> 00:19:44.940]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.201]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:47.082]  It's incredible.
[00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:56.287]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:19:56.287 --> 00:19:58.129]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:17.007]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:21.669]  Do you dare ride the lightning of liberty?
[00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:32.234]  Do you have the will to admit that the bell is tolling for the battle between the forces of freedom and the forces of darkness?
[00:20:34.062 --> 00:20:36.485]  That is the history of this world.
[00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:40.911]  But somehow, they convinced you our government was different.
[00:20:40.911 --> 00:20:49.902]  That there weren't individuals and groups out there that would combine forces to set up a corporate world tyranny.
[00:20:49.902 --> 00:20:51.103]  That's what we now face.
[00:20:52.702 --> 00:20:58.023]  And you know that the fruits of the New World Order are slavery and bondage.
[00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:00.484]  Let me just give you some of the headlines here.
[00:21:00.484 --> 00:21:05.245]  Let's just go over some of these important headlines right here today.
[00:21:05.245 --> 00:21:07.006]  This is from CNN.
[00:21:07.006 --> 00:21:11.367]  China flies fighter jets into disputed air defense zone.
[00:21:11.367 --> 00:21:12.527]  Japan remains defiant.
[00:21:13.007 --> 00:21:17.230]  South Korea has now been flying fighter jets into the disputed zone.
[00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:23.013]  And I want to be clear, folks, this is globalists that have invested in China and the U.S., playing us off against each other.
[00:21:23.013 --> 00:21:25.975]  So remember, there's a much bigger game going on here.
[00:21:25.975 --> 00:21:29.517]  But the communist Chinese have been expanding worldwide.
[00:21:29.517 --> 00:21:31.659]  They've been giving the Panama Canal, you name it.
[00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:39.923]  And they are definitely expanding into an international defense zone that was already there, if you look at the maps.
[00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:48.348]  They have massively expanded, in some cases, more than 80 miles out into the ocean.
[00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:57.433]  And are saying that international aircraft, American Airlines, you name it, have to ask permission to basically fly just a few miles away from the coast of Japan.
[00:21:57.433 --> 00:22:00.755]  This is a serious, serious provocation.
[00:22:02.427 --> 00:22:12.669]  And it all shows where the pivot is going, where the United States, under globalist control, while they move all our factories and power plants out of the U.S.
[00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:29.233]  to China, while the globalists shut America down, they're busy using what's left of our military to menace the Communist Chinese Party to play ball with them, as they devalue the dollar and as the Communist Chinese are the largest holders of so-called U.S.
[00:22:29.233 --> 00:22:29.493]  debt.
[00:22:31.024 --> 00:22:33.646]  So this is a very, very serious situation.
[00:22:33.646 --> 00:22:39.789]  I will assure you it's more important than the star of Fast and Furious dying in a car wreck today, and that's the big top story, of course.
[00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:41.230]  We have a nuclear war with China.
[00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.411]  They've targeted all our cities.
[00:22:42.411 --> 00:22:46.653]  They say they may preemptively nuke the United States.
[00:22:46.653 --> 00:22:51.356]  If these provocations continue, they publish in newspapers the U.S.
[00:22:51.356 --> 00:22:59.001]  cities they're going to target, including the population death tolls, civilian cities they plan to target,
[00:23:00.752 --> 00:23:05.975]  And the average trendy can't even find China on a map.
[00:23:05.975 --> 00:23:11.778]  But they do know all about how to put on a football jersey and go to a sports bar and act real tough.
[00:23:11.778 --> 00:23:14.099]  So, I guess I'm kind of a wimpy guy.
[00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:15.820]  I'm here talking about geopolitics.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.362]  When there's football on, folks, that's obviously I'm a bad person.
[00:23:20.362 --> 00:23:23.504]  You know, I know about fractional reserve banking, QE Unlimited.
[00:23:23.504 --> 00:23:25.485]  I agree with all these economists have to say.
[00:23:25.485 --> 00:23:27.086]  I'm just, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[00:23:27.708 --> 00:23:32.031]  Hey, if you're just some schlub, doesn't do any research, doesn't care about freedom, you can just put me down.
[00:23:32.031 --> 00:23:32.572]  You're better than me.
[00:23:32.572 --> 00:23:34.173]  You just go, oh, that's one of those weirdos.
[00:23:34.173 --> 00:23:37.795]  He reads books.
[00:23:37.795 --> 00:23:38.176]  Sorry.
[00:23:38.176 --> 00:23:41.258]  Let me get into the rest of the news here for you.
[00:23:41.258 --> 00:23:46.842]  You know, the number one cause of death that's unnatural in this country, and worldwide as well, is transportation.
[00:23:48.288 --> 00:23:51.430]  But you know, honeybees kill over 200 people a year in the U.S.
[00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.831]  alone.
[00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:53.632]  Wasps kill more than 300.
[00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:54.953]  Rattlesnakes, several hundred.
[00:23:54.953 --> 00:23:56.274]  Water moccasins, more than 400.
[00:23:56.274 --> 00:23:58.655]  But people aren't scared of those.
[00:23:58.655 --> 00:24:02.638]  They're scared of great white sharks that kill five people a year worldwide on average.
[00:24:02.638 --> 00:24:04.319]  Because the movie said you should be afraid of it.
[00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:07.502]  And it's the same thing with terrorism.
[00:24:07.502 --> 00:24:11.745]  You've got a better chance of dying from a honeybee than you do of dying of a terrorist attack.
[00:24:13.476 --> 00:24:15.238]  You can look up those numbers.
[00:24:15.238 --> 00:24:15.938]  Even the U.S.
[00:24:15.938 --> 00:24:17.960]  News and World Report admits that.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.223]  About a year after I kept putting out that factoid, I just went and looked up the death numbers.
[00:24:21.223 --> 00:24:26.088]  Now that's a well-known meme you hear, that honeybees kill more people than terrorism.
[00:24:26.088 --> 00:24:27.509]  I hear it everywhere.
[00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:33.575]  Just like I said, Obamacare is like the Nigerian email scam, where they just rope you into more and more.
[00:24:33.575 --> 00:24:38.039]  I'm not bragging, it's just interesting to see how we can put a meme out now and see people pick it up.
[00:24:38.939 --> 00:24:51.244]  The reason I point this out is they say they want to take all your rights and spy on you and have federalized police and giant armored vehicles and billions of rounds of ammo for Muslim terrorists who the government on record runs overseas.
[00:24:53.749 --> 00:25:01.555]  They told Russia if they don't play ball with NATO and Saudi Arabia and let them hand Syria over to Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:01.555 --> 00:25:04.157]  This was said two months ago in mainstream news.
[00:25:04.157 --> 00:25:07.499]  BBC reported it, London Guardian, Russian news, but not here.
[00:25:07.499 --> 00:25:14.985]  That Saudi Arabia, with the backing of the US, the people that run our country, would blow up the Winter Olympics coming up in Russia.
[00:25:16.547 --> 00:25:17.648]  Would blow them up!
[00:25:17.648 --> 00:25:19.529]  That was in the mainstream news!
[00:25:19.529 --> 00:25:23.391]  The head of Saudi intelligence said, we will blow up the Olympics!
[00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:27.273]  If you don't stop fighting Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:25:27.273 --> 00:25:35.937]  But meanwhile, I've got to have some TSA minion narrow their eyes, ask me questions, have a chat down, like play this game like I'm a suspect.
[00:25:35.937 --> 00:25:38.219]  It's all about government teaching you you're bad.
[00:25:38.219 --> 00:25:42.841]  Government teaching you you're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:45.062]  I can't even go to our ranch we've had since 1829.
[00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:54.614]  And camp, without a game warden pulling up and demanding to come in the shack or whatever, to see if we have illegal deer.
[00:25:54.614 --> 00:25:56.375]  Dead.
[00:25:56.375 --> 00:25:58.756]  Because I'm guilty until proven slave.
[00:25:58.756 --> 00:25:59.316]  That's how it is.
[00:25:59.316 --> 00:26:03.959]  But the government can launder all the drug money, run all the white slavery, that's fine.
[00:26:03.959 --> 00:26:05.639]  It's all about, we're bad, they're good.
[00:26:05.639 --> 00:26:08.201]  No, they're scum, the government's criminal!
[00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:12.223]  It's converted over to total tyranny and is trying to get rid of any liberty that's left.
[00:26:13.834 --> 00:26:15.254]  That's how this works, folks.
[00:26:15.254 --> 00:26:16.114]  You're the enemy.
[00:26:16.114 --> 00:26:17.035]  You're the milk cow.
[00:26:17.035 --> 00:26:19.155]  You're the blood bag to the vampires.
[00:26:19.155 --> 00:26:20.975]  And they're not going to back off.
[00:26:20.975 --> 00:26:23.836]  Historically, we've gone past the point of no return.
[00:26:23.836 --> 00:26:26.156]  We're going down the rat hole.
[00:26:26.156 --> 00:26:27.936]  That's really the big announcement I want to make.
[00:26:27.936 --> 00:26:43.059]  We've just got to figure out, those of us that produce, how we're going to hide out during all this and not be sucked dry by the giant hundred million welfare heads and all the government pimps and scum and trash and morons and people that can't even talk or tie their shoelaces.
[00:26:44.656 --> 00:26:49.083]  Just giant hordes of scum everywhere, running wild.
[00:26:49.083 --> 00:26:49.544]  Excuse me.
[00:26:49.544 --> 00:26:51.707]  They'll probably have nuclear war before then.
[00:26:51.707 --> 00:26:58.678]  The government's just filled with doddering, nepotism-filled, narcissistic scum.
[00:26:58.678 --> 00:26:59.118]  Excuse me.
[00:26:59.955 --> 00:27:01.877]  Let me go back to the real threat here.
[00:27:01.877 --> 00:27:03.279]  Transportation.
[00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:07.843]  Upwards of 300,000 people die a year of transportation-related fatalities.
[00:27:07.843 --> 00:27:10.166]  It's like a million-plus injuries.
[00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:13.950]  Four dead, more than 60 injured in New York City train derailment nightmare.
[00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.831]  You know why the U.S.
[00:27:14.831 --> 00:27:16.232]  has so many derailments?
[00:27:16.232 --> 00:27:20.897]  Our trains can't even go above 45 miles an hour because we have the worst train system in the world.
[00:27:21.678 --> 00:27:24.459]  The worst train system in the industrialized world.
[00:27:24.459 --> 00:27:30.882]  It's a joke because the globalists have had a policy for 50 years to shut this country down.
[00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:31.822]  You understand that?
[00:27:31.822 --> 00:27:38.905]  And they've got you now as a bunch of service workers or bureaucrats or corporate minions with government contracts.
[00:27:38.905 --> 00:27:40.326]  They've got you right where they want you.
[00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:42.727]  You know why the trains all fly off the tracks constantly?
[00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:44.488]  Because the rails are rotting.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.523]  And you can't go about 45 miles an hour or the train starts jumping.
[00:27:49.523 --> 00:27:52.886]  But then they order the train to get there quicker.
[00:27:52.886 --> 00:27:55.108]  And so then it flies off the rails.
[00:27:55.108 --> 00:27:57.871]  And then they have a bunch of reasons of why it happened.
[00:27:57.871 --> 00:27:59.592]  I'm sure they'll end up indicting somebody.
[00:27:59.592 --> 00:28:01.074]  Four dead, 60 injured.
[00:28:01.074 --> 00:28:04.837]  And maybe they had some TSA agents on there blessing the tracks.
[00:28:04.837 --> 00:28:06.518]  That would have fixed it.
[00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:09.921]  Or maybe on the train, maybe they would have grabbed more people's genitals.
[00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:11.463]  Getting on the train, that would have fixed it.
[00:28:11.463 --> 00:28:12.724]  Because they have that up in New York City.
[00:28:12.964 --> 00:28:23.219]  Where they literally grab your genitals, search you, have guys with machine guns bugging their eyes out at you, when their bosses blew up the World Trade Center, ran the whole Al Qaeda operation, blew up Building 7 down the street.
[00:28:23.219 --> 00:28:25.542]  They all love it!
[00:28:25.542 --> 00:28:26.003]  Love it!
[00:28:28.522 --> 00:28:31.623]  Oh, but the big news is, dead at 40 in fiery car crash.
[00:28:31.623 --> 00:28:32.983]  We're so sorry for him.
[00:28:32.983 --> 00:28:35.084]  Paul Walker, riding with his buddy, and I am sorry.
[00:28:35.084 --> 00:28:38.305]  But I'm supposed to only get concerned about one person, like Stalin said.
[00:28:38.305 --> 00:28:39.665]  One person dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:28:39.665 --> 00:28:40.885]  10,000 die, it's a statistic.
[00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:44.146]  We're going to talk about Black Friday when we come back.
[00:28:44.146 --> 00:28:46.587]  Huge technology news.
[00:28:46.587 --> 00:28:49.688]  Comet news as well.
[00:28:49.688 --> 00:28:50.888]  And so much more.
[00:28:50.888 --> 00:28:57.170]  And we're going to get into the globalist master plan, where they want to take you, why they're doing all this, and the NSA.
[00:29:00.396 --> 00:29:05.858]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:29:05.858 --> 00:29:14.741]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:29:14.741 --> 00:29:22.564]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:29:22.564 --> 00:29:29.967]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:29:30.467 --> 00:29:34.429]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:29:34.429 --> 00:29:38.610]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:45.773]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[00:29:45.773 --> 00:29:52.976]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front.
[00:29:52.976 --> 00:29:57.018]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.063]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[00:30:03.063 --> 00:30:09.007]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:15.593]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:30:15.593 --> 00:30:21.277]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:30:21.277 --> 00:30:24.920]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.903]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[00:30:28.903 --> 00:30:33.506]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[00:30:33.506 --> 00:30:36.008]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[00:30:36.008 --> 00:30:39.871]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:44.294]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[00:30:44.294 --> 00:30:46.936]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:30:47.256 --> 00:30:54.079]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:30:54.079 --> 00:30:59.320]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:10.004]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:31:10.004 --> 00:31:11.845]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:31:12.065 --> 00:31:12.945]  Fluoride.
[00:31:12.945 --> 00:31:14.866]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:14.866 --> 00:31:21.429]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:31:21.429 --> 00:31:26.370]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:32.673]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:31:32.673 --> 00:31:35.094]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:31:35.094 --> 00:31:38.035]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:31:38.035 --> 00:31:41.416]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:31:41.536 --> 00:31:46.962]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:46.962 --> 00:31:52.068]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[00:31:52.068 --> 00:31:53.269]  I take it every day.
[00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:56.133]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:59.296 --> 00:32:02.317]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:32:02.317 --> 00:32:07.319]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:32:07.319 --> 00:32:14.502]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:32:14.642 --> 00:32:20.266]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:32:20.266 --> 00:32:24.289]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:29.033]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:32:29.033 --> 00:32:34.237]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:32:34.477 --> 00:32:37.720]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.282]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:32:40.282 --> 00:32:44.986]  AeroSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:32:44.986 --> 00:32:47.869]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:32:47.869 --> 00:32:55.095]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWar possible.
[00:32:55.095 --> 00:32:56.357]  We're getting prepared.
[00:32:56.357 --> 00:32:57.017]  Are you?
[00:32:57.017 --> 00:32:57.818]  InfoWarshop.com
[00:33:00.768 --> 00:33:04.371]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:07.693]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:07.693 --> 00:33:17.120]  We're live!
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.881]  It's Sunday!
[00:33:19.465 --> 00:33:23.650]  Listen to this conspiracy theorist.
[00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:23.990]  No, no, no.
[00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.251]  Unlimited government's good.
[00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:26.272]  Don't listen to Eisenhower.
[00:33:35.658 --> 00:33:39.102]  It's good to turn our police into military.
[00:33:39.102 --> 00:33:41.285]  It's a military mission in North St.
[00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:41.946]  Louis.
[00:33:41.946 --> 00:33:44.489]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:48.734]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:33:48.734 --> 00:33:50.997]  And they're openly training to take on the Tea Party.
[00:33:51.477 --> 00:33:52.177]  Not Al-Qaeda.
[00:33:52.177 --> 00:33:53.398]  Yes, Mrs. Feinstein.
[00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:54.659]  Oh, brainwash people?
[00:34:07.168 --> 00:34:08.629]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that!
[00:34:35.268 --> 00:34:37.090]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:37.711]  Uh-huh.
[00:34:37.711 --> 00:34:44.478]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal... Mercury's good for you.
[00:34:44.478 --> 00:34:48.983]  ...choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only... The government loves you.
[00:34:48.983 --> 00:34:51.766]  Heavily armed officers and... Take your mercury.
[00:34:51.766 --> 00:34:52.667]  ...suspect.
[00:34:52.667 --> 00:34:54.569]  House... Everybody knows it's good.
[00:34:57.998 --> 00:35:00.219]  All the training is to take our guns.
[00:35:00.219 --> 00:35:00.779]  All of it.
[00:35:00.779 --> 00:35:03.760]  They literally bad mouth George Washington.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.001]  Oh, the government's not bad.
[00:35:06.001 --> 00:35:07.021]  Everything's fine.
[00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:10.143]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:11.443]  Get in there, slave.
[00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:13.344]  I have two words for you.
[00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:15.125]  Predator globes.
[00:35:15.125 --> 00:35:16.145]  You will never see it coming.
[00:35:20.208 --> 00:35:23.051]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[00:35:23.051 --> 00:35:32.322]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[00:35:32.322 --> 00:35:33.123]  They let them in the area.
[00:35:33.123 --> 00:35:35.866]  They told them they could come in and now they're coming in like they're trespassers.
[00:35:35.866 --> 00:35:36.907]  Until proven slaves.
[00:35:37.788 --> 00:35:44.916]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down if you want to come and take us!
[00:35:44.916 --> 00:35:45.877]  Ooh, that's a terrorist.
[00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:47.759]  Ooh, that's bad.
[00:35:47.759 --> 00:35:49.040]  Oh, that's that man.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:49.541]  Oh, no.
[00:35:49.541 --> 00:35:50.061]  Oh, no.
[00:35:59.915 --> 00:36:02.178]  Oh my gosh, they're fearless.
[00:36:02.178 --> 00:36:03.399]  They don't want to be slaves?
[00:36:03.399 --> 00:36:04.901]  I mean, under North Korean rule?
[00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:07.364]  I mean, government's God.
[00:36:07.364 --> 00:36:10.748]  That's the American way, right?
[00:36:10.748 --> 00:36:14.352]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists.
[00:36:14.352 --> 00:36:15.553]  Don't listen to Eisenhower.
[00:36:15.553 --> 00:36:19.578]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:36:22.256 --> 00:36:26.758]  Alright folks, that's the type of intros we have on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:36:26.758 --> 00:36:32.761]  We have new intros every week, 7 o'clock central, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:51.090]  Let me hit some more headlines, then in the next segment I will get into the culture of tyranny and the revolution against common sense, the revolution against prosperity, the revolution against liberty, the revolution against the renaissance, the enlightenment, the revolution against the individual.
[00:36:51.870 --> 00:37:03.896]  And I'm going to explain why the globalists want it, in their own documents and own words, and where they think they're going to take us, and then I'm going to show evidence that they won't take us, they're going to take us straight to hell.
[00:37:03.896 --> 00:37:06.857]  Straight to World War III.
[00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:15.821]  The globalists are so delusional, folks, 91% according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, of nuclear reactors are leaking.
[00:37:15.821 --> 00:37:18.002]  In the past they would fix them, they just don't care now.
[00:37:19.184 --> 00:37:22.748]  It's like they're homicidal demons trying to kill us.
[00:37:22.748 --> 00:37:23.508]  That's what I'm telling you.
[00:37:23.508 --> 00:37:35.901]  The establishment is so busy with their mistresses and their boyfriends and partying and being a bunch of narcissists that they have gone nihilistically haywire and have got to be stopped.
[00:37:37.401 --> 00:37:41.084]  But the general public's gotten totally decadent and out of their mind as well.
[00:37:41.084 --> 00:37:41.925]  It's television.
[00:37:41.925 --> 00:37:42.625]  It's the culture.
[00:37:42.625 --> 00:37:44.087]  People think that's real.
[00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:54.275]  They think... Even famous people, I know, are totally unhappy, obsessed with other Hollywood stars and people thinking they're living some wonderland, even though they're living five doors down from them.
[00:37:54.275 --> 00:38:02.462]  And they're all totally unhappy, chasing a carrot that doesn't exist, when absolute enlightenment, absolute Valhalla, absolute...
[00:38:03.403 --> 00:38:10.965]  Energy and information is all around us on this planetoid in deep space hurtling through the edge of the Milky Way.
[00:38:10.965 --> 00:38:12.986]  Whoa!
[00:38:12.986 --> 00:38:19.248]  You are not going to find fulfillment with all these turds on TMZ!
[00:38:19.248 --> 00:38:24.830]  Unfortunately, most people have not experienced what I've experienced and had a chance to get to know
[00:38:26.511 --> 00:38:30.114]  Most of the big Hollywood people, been to their houses, you name it.
[00:38:30.114 --> 00:38:44.585]  And why do you think over the years back when I would fly out to LA or wherever I got invited and people would fly me out there, sometimes on private jets, like sending their taxi or their driver for you.
[00:38:44.585 --> 00:38:45.486]  People say, well, why don't you do it now?
[00:38:45.486 --> 00:38:46.327]  I don't have time for it.
[00:38:46.327 --> 00:38:47.407]  I've been there, done that 50 times.
[00:38:49.099 --> 00:39:01.407]  That those folks are reaching out to me just because they've already been inside the system and know there isn't some grass greener on the other side, there's nothing else.
[00:39:01.407 --> 00:39:06.090]  And that's, I'm not telling you about stuff like that to brag.
[00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:10.974]  Believe me, 99% of what I've seen in Hollywood and New York, no one will ever even hear.
[00:39:10.974 --> 00:39:12.735]  The point is, is that
[00:39:14.798 --> 00:39:29.358]  I'm telling you that so you realize that the system dangles this whole fake culture in your face to make you think you're inadequate and unfulfilled so you'll buy into their culture thinking it will fulfill you when it's designed to wreck you.
[00:39:30.802 --> 00:39:48.934]  If you can go to a beautiful park and look at the sky, or if you can look up at the night sky, or if you can paint a painting, or if you can go to church and feel a connection to God, or if you can be in love, like George Strait says, if you're not loving, you're not living, then you are fulfilled.
[00:39:48.934 --> 00:39:50.435]  I've got all this news to cover.
[00:39:50.435 --> 00:39:57.920]  I just wanna say, the system will not empower you.
[00:40:00.248 --> 00:40:05.052]  It is there to enslave you and to shutter your mind because these people want to be God.
[00:40:05.052 --> 00:40:06.754]  They want you looking at them.
[00:40:06.754 --> 00:40:23.548]  They want you believing their artificial construct, their worldwide Madison Avenue projection of artificial reality, a giant Times Square system where everywhere you go, you're bombarded with their messages.
[00:40:23.548 --> 00:40:27.211]  And I got multiple Amber Alerts on my iPhone, my slave phone.
[00:40:29.091 --> 00:40:29.791]  I don't know.
[00:40:42.734 --> 00:40:46.275]  All the media stage, they lie to them, and they don't even get access anymore.
[00:40:46.275 --> 00:40:47.136]  They don't need access.
[00:40:47.136 --> 00:40:51.037]  They put out a press release, you regurgitate it, or you lose your job.
[00:40:51.037 --> 00:40:56.219]  And so now all the sycophants in the corporate media are freaking out because now they're not even needed.
[00:40:56.219 --> 00:41:01.341]  And they're moving to the next phase where you're all gonna be out of a job, and then they're gonna try to shut down the real media.
[00:41:01.341 --> 00:41:02.081]  That's next.
[00:41:02.081 --> 00:41:05.563]  And that's all been announced by the Pentagon!
[00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:07.943]  I mean, here's what's frustrating about this, folks.
[00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:09.644]  99% of all this
[00:41:12.245 --> 00:41:15.687]  Literally.
[00:41:15.687 --> 00:41:20.591]  Of what I'm telling you is on record white papers, DARPA.
[00:41:20.591 --> 00:41:24.393]  The Advanced Defense Laboratories.
[00:41:24.393 --> 00:41:36.762]  Our system, the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of in 1960, is run by offshore megabanks who are eugenicists, transhumanists, who've already decided the course of the world, and you and I aren't in it.
[00:41:38.007 --> 00:41:47.754]  And to make that self-fulfilling prophecy reasonable, they have set up a culture and a system to dumb you down and turn you into the most mindless of idiotic animals.
[00:41:47.754 --> 00:41:48.955]  And every statistic shows it.
[00:41:48.955 --> 00:41:50.876]  Physical IQ going down.
[00:41:50.876 --> 00:41:52.597]  Dexterity going down.
[00:41:52.597 --> 00:41:54.439]  Cancer rates off the charts.
[00:41:54.439 --> 00:41:54.839]  Everything.
[00:41:54.839 --> 00:41:57.521]  We are being murdered.
[00:41:57.521 --> 00:41:58.601]  Murdered.
[00:41:58.601 --> 00:42:01.844]  And the average so-called person
[00:42:03.214 --> 00:42:28.912]  doesn't even understand that or you hear it and you live in a fantasy world because from the time you were born in your diapers in front of the television while mama was you know in the back doing lord knows what and daddy wasn't home the average person was raised by the television set incrementally screwing you up with fake role models and archetypes until people think they can just say I don't believe that guy and then it makes it not true
[00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:35.740]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, I'm going to get into the total culture of lies.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:41.161]  Then I'm going to get into new low for Congress, just 6% approved.
[00:42:41.161 --> 00:42:43.462]  Finally lower than car salespeople.
[00:42:43.462 --> 00:42:47.343]  It's not fair to car salesmen to compare them to Congress.
[00:42:47.343 --> 00:42:53.025]  And then we're going to get into the attack on the free press by the NSA corporate fraud grid.
[00:42:53.025 --> 00:42:55.085]  And then I'm going to get into a science stack.
[00:42:55.085 --> 00:42:58.406]  And then I will get into the culture of fraud.
[00:42:59.867 --> 00:43:04.595]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:43:04.595 --> 00:43:07.720]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:13.288]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:43:13.288 --> 00:43:14.891]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:43:15.191 --> 00:43:16.832]  We are what we eat.
[00:43:16.832 --> 00:43:21.514]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:43:21.514 --> 00:43:25.736]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:28.277]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:43:28.277 --> 00:43:34.520]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:06.952]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:44:06.952 --> 00:44:09.333]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:44:09.333 --> 00:44:09.773]  The U.S.
[00:44:09.773 --> 00:44:14.014]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:44:14.014 --> 00:44:16.975]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:44:16.975 --> 00:44:18.475]  They want that attack to come.
[00:44:18.475 --> 00:44:24.677]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:44:25.057 --> 00:44:27.718]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:44:27.718 --> 00:44:32.681]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:44:32.681 --> 00:44:40.125]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:44:40.425 --> 00:44:43.189]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:44:43.189 --> 00:44:46.292]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:50.858]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[00:44:50.858 --> 00:44:55.443]  Available only at InfoWarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:44:59.414 --> 00:45:10.122]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:45:10.122 --> 00:45:12.163]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:45:12.163 --> 00:45:13.064]  Fluoride!
[00:45:13.064 --> 00:45:14.985]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:45:14.985 --> 00:45:21.550]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:26.473]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:45:26.473 --> 00:45:28.154]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ
[00:45:29.295 --> 00:45:29.615]  I agree.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.482]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:46:05.482 --> 00:46:14.364]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:46:14.364 --> 00:46:22.187]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:46:22.187 --> 00:46:29.569]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:46:30.089 --> 00:46:34.051]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:38.252]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:52.578]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front.
[00:46:52.578 --> 00:46:56.640]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:47:00.788 --> 00:47:04.370]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:18.017]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:18.017 --> 00:47:27.101]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:27.101 --> 00:47:28.042]  You see folks,
[00:47:29.554 --> 00:47:31.836]  They had arrests in more than 10 cities.
[00:47:31.836 --> 00:47:34.318]  Thousands demonstrated against Walmart.
[00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:40.343]  And the fact that people that work there can't even afford to have Thanksgiving turkey.
[00:47:40.343 --> 00:47:43.726]  Now they're having fast food strikes planned in hundreds of cities.
[00:47:43.726 --> 00:47:48.110]  That's the headline on DrudgeReport.com with a crying Ronald McDonald.
[00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:50.312]  The people that work there can't even afford to eat there.
[00:47:51.621 --> 00:48:05.107]  And again, government creates the de-industrialization, creates the inflation by devaluing the dollar, where Mr. Gaddy's just four or five years ago was $5 for a buffet, it's now $9-something for a buffet.
[00:48:05.107 --> 00:48:10.749]  Oh, but there's no inflation at the local pizza place, even though it's almost doubled in five years.
[00:48:13.345 --> 00:48:18.588]  I forgot to eat except for breakfast today, so I never eat at Mr. Gatti's, but it's okay, local pizza.
[00:48:18.588 --> 00:48:22.050]  So I pulled in knowing about $2.50 that they had at Buffet.
[00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:36.739]  Hadn't been in there in years, and I walked in, talked to the manager and stuff, and they've almost doubled their prices the last five years, and their profits are way down, because the economy, obviously, is in freefall, and there is huge inflation.
[00:48:36.739 --> 00:48:42.163]  But the government puts out fake inflation numbers, and fake employment numbers, and it comes out it's fake!
[00:48:43.393 --> 00:48:56.078]  Just like Obamacare doubles, triples, quadruples, it was written by absolutely ruthless offshore banks that admit that they want to bankrupt you to make you politically manageable.
[00:48:56.889 --> 00:48:58.370]  They don't want prosperity.
[00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:03.716]  They don't want uppity middle classes and an example of the world of America and the West being rich.
[00:49:03.716 --> 00:49:06.178]  They don't want to take our wealth under globalism.
[00:49:06.178 --> 00:49:07.239]  That's what liberals think.
[00:49:07.239 --> 00:49:11.503]  Oh, globalism is you take Western wealth and you give it to Africa or Latin America.
[00:49:11.503 --> 00:49:13.125]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:49:13.125 --> 00:49:17.149]  You bring them down and us down to their level.
[00:49:17.149 --> 00:49:20.112]  And that's what the Copenhagen Treaty four years ago that got leaked showed.
[00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:25.192]  Where the carbon taxes were almost double on the third world that they were on us.
[00:49:25.192 --> 00:49:32.497]  This is a shutdown system because for the technocrats, they already control the wealth and the issuance of currency and credit.
[00:49:32.497 --> 00:49:36.280]  They want to control the individual.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.082]  And they want to control what's left of the nation state.
[00:49:39.082 --> 00:49:40.883]  And they want no one to stand in their way.
[00:49:40.883 --> 00:49:49.970]  And the way to do that is to, through regulations and other systems, shut everyone down but themselves.
[00:49:51.977 --> 00:49:55.600]  That is the name of the game.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:03.225]  Write the regulations where they're exempt, everybody else is weighed down in ball and chain, red tape, and then they take over.
[00:50:03.225 --> 00:50:05.747]  It's economic conquest.
[00:50:05.747 --> 00:50:14.473]  And this is a fact in economic white papers and best-selling books by insiders and even people that write books for this admit it.
[00:50:15.819 --> 00:50:20.142]  Like Superclass, written by the head of the Kissinger Group, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, and all of them.
[00:50:20.142 --> 00:50:21.402]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating.
[00:50:21.402 --> 00:50:23.223]  People say, oh, I choose not to believe that.
[00:50:23.223 --> 00:50:27.146]  You choose not to believe the sun came up today?
[00:50:27.146 --> 00:50:32.789]  You choose not to believe the high in Austin, Texas, where I'm broadcasting from, was 72?
[00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:33.289]  Degrees?
[00:50:33.289 --> 00:50:35.230]  I mean, it's a fact!
[00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:38.252]  These aren't my opinions!
[00:50:38.252 --> 00:50:39.753]  And so I want to throw this out there.
[00:50:40.759 --> 00:50:45.042]  Well then come back in the next hour and take your calls, and specifically on this topic.
[00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:46.443]  A lot of times it's open phones.
[00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:54.089]  This is on the issue of what are your examples of lawlessness in government and corporations and real discrimination?
[00:50:54.089 --> 00:51:09.259]  Because we're all trained to see discrimination as, you're black, I'm white, or I'm black, you're white, and you think somebody served you quicker at the checkout line, and then the media hypes that up, or gay people beat up straight people, or straight people beat up gay people, let's all fight with each other,
[00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:17.778]  All this divide and conquer, Catholic against Protestant, agnostic against Christian, on and on and on.
[00:51:17.778 --> 00:51:27.928]  Well, meanwhile, there's six big banks worldwide that have gotten, total, last time they put numbers out a few years ago, $48 trillion of U.S.
[00:51:27.928 --> 00:51:32.052]  taxpayer money to bail out their debts that weren't our national debt.
[00:51:32.052 --> 00:51:33.594]  Our national debt's only $17 trillion.
[00:51:34.943 --> 00:51:36.924]  The Chinese only own 2 trillion of it.
[00:51:36.924 --> 00:51:38.165]  We're told how much we're in debt.
[00:51:38.165 --> 00:51:41.827]  We've given 48 plus trillion, and that's an old number.
[00:51:41.827 --> 00:51:43.367]  Worldwide, it's over 100 trillion.
[00:51:43.367 --> 00:51:44.808]  That's mainstream news.
[00:51:44.808 --> 00:51:49.590]  But footnote, oh, 100 trillion of your money that you got to pay interest on to give these people the money.
[00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:53.953]  Folks, that's why they've got us all divided and conquered.
[00:51:53.953 --> 00:51:55.714]  It's the old British Empire model.
[00:51:55.714 --> 00:51:58.635]  Play groups off against each other.
[00:51:58.635 --> 00:52:03.778]  And they're bringing in a system that's predatory against virtuous, intelligent,
[00:52:04.682 --> 00:52:05.482]  Middle class.
[00:52:05.482 --> 00:52:06.563]  They want that wiped out.
[00:52:06.563 --> 00:52:08.464]  That is the ultimate sin of this group.
[00:52:08.464 --> 00:52:12.786]  This isn't just some elite that wants to take over and is using economics to conquer us.
[00:52:12.786 --> 00:52:20.369]  They want to conquer the human spirit, the human genome, and the world's genetics, in their own words, to be the mind of God.
[00:52:20.369 --> 00:52:23.611]  That's what DARPA has said through Google.
[00:52:23.611 --> 00:52:25.752]  They say they don't believe in God yet.
[00:52:25.752 --> 00:52:27.173]  They will become gods.
[00:52:27.173 --> 00:52:31.114]  The chief technologist and futurist at Google, Ray Kurzweil, says that.
[00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:31.975]  They all say that.
[00:52:32.935 --> 00:52:43.298]  And again, when I criticize it, they have the New York Times, the Washington Post, the BBC, Channel 4, in England, all of them go, Jones says the elite are going to merge with machines and become God.
[00:52:43.298 --> 00:52:44.379]  He's insane.
[00:52:44.379 --> 00:52:45.899]  I'm quoting them.
[00:52:45.899 --> 00:52:51.081]  Whether it's going to happen or not, whether it's feasible or not, the point is, this is what makes them tick.
[00:52:51.081 --> 00:52:52.582]  This is their game plan.
[00:52:52.582 --> 00:52:54.362]  Do you understand me?
[00:52:54.362 --> 00:52:56.603]  The stupid football game doesn't matter!
[00:52:56.843 --> 00:53:01.910]  They're literally put chemical weapons in the tap water to dumb you down!
[00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:08.440]  That's why you're so stupid!
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.863]  You understand this?
[00:53:10.863 --> 00:53:11.965]  That's why you can't get upset.
[00:53:11.965 --> 00:53:12.946]  That's why you're in a fog.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.521]  They're attacking you, and I'm not talking to our regular listeners.
[00:53:17.521 --> 00:53:20.683]  I'm talking as we're on a whole bunch of AM and FM stations.
[00:53:20.683 --> 00:53:23.444]  160 plus weekdays, over 80 on the Sunday show.
[00:53:23.444 --> 00:53:27.906]  We're reaching millions of people right now, and I'm talking to new listeners.
[00:53:27.906 --> 00:53:30.127]  This isn't a game!
[00:53:30.127 --> 00:53:33.828]  This isn't just some other channel and somebody else up there talking.
[00:53:33.828 --> 00:53:35.689]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:53:37.378 --> 00:53:45.484]  Finally, Ammo Land has reported, and so has the NRA, on what I've been telling you for years, because I read the news every day, all over the country.
[00:53:45.484 --> 00:53:51.209]  It's usually an old man who still thinks they live in America, cleaning a gun, even in rural areas, in their garage.
[00:53:51.209 --> 00:54:00.676]  A neighbor, who's moved in from New York, or California, or some other big city in one of those states, sees them cleaning the gun, calls the police, and the police take all their guns and arrest them.
[00:54:02.867 --> 00:54:12.152]  I see stories where a guy was in a rural area cleaning a deer in his backyard, and some Californian saw it, called the police, and the police said, we're going to go ahead and arrest you.
[00:54:12.152 --> 00:54:14.033]  Look that up.
[00:54:14.033 --> 00:54:15.013]  And you're like, how do they do it?
[00:54:15.013 --> 00:54:16.194]  Well, it's their policy.
[00:54:16.194 --> 00:54:17.454]  It's called tyranny.
[00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:18.795]  Look at these articles.
[00:54:18.795 --> 00:54:21.476]  Legalized theft of guns, ammo, land, November 25th.
[00:54:21.476 --> 00:54:22.897]  I've been talking about this for days.
[00:54:22.897 --> 00:54:26.719]  It's got examples from Arizona to California to Texas.
[00:54:27.958 --> 00:54:34.201]  And in here, it gives mainstream news links to where the police literally come to your house.
[00:54:36.007 --> 00:54:40.829]  Because a tree fell into your neighbor's car or whatever and they see guns in your house, they take them.
[00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:50.312]  And then you've got to go fight in court for two years at a cost two, three times what the guns are worth to get your guns back and then they still refuse lawlessly.
[00:54:50.312 --> 00:54:54.953]  That's like if the cops openly say beat your son to death in front of everyone on television.
[00:54:54.953 --> 00:54:56.353]  This has happened before.
[00:54:56.353 --> 00:55:01.435]  In fact, a cop out in California, his son was beaten to death for no reason by eight cops.
[00:55:01.435 --> 00:55:02.655]  They went to file a complaint.
[00:55:02.655 --> 00:55:04.196]  They said, well, we're not going to take your complaint.
[00:55:04.798 --> 00:55:15.588]  See, they don't tell you it's the law they've got to take it or they've committed a felony and are now part of the crime aiding and abetting under the Constitution, state law, and common law.
[00:55:15.588 --> 00:55:20.892]  They will lie in a criminal conspiracy against the public and say, we're not taking your complaint.
[00:55:20.892 --> 00:55:25.977]  Or, we're going to give it to Internal Affairs, which is a fake complaint, not a criminal complaint on record.
[00:55:27.441 --> 00:55:32.326]  And folks, I'm not ganging up on the police here, because they're just where the rubber meets the road.
[00:55:32.326 --> 00:55:36.892]  I'm talking about this because we're under NATO control of our military right now.
[00:55:36.892 --> 00:55:38.253]  On record.
[00:55:38.253 --> 00:55:39.214]  Totally illegal.
[00:55:39.214 --> 00:55:40.636]  Violates the Constitution.
[00:55:40.636 --> 00:55:41.597]  Congress has done nothing.
[00:55:43.331 --> 00:55:52.278]  Obama on energy, on borders, on defense, on Obamacare now acts as a dictator and actually have it in the news.
[00:55:52.278 --> 00:55:55.980]  Paul Krugman was in the New York Times last week saying it's good to have him as a dictator.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:03.626]  They create a problem, they create the crisis, they don't let it go to waste and then now we'll let him decide what to do and Congress is going along with it.
[00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:05.688]  The NSA is illegally spying on us.
[00:56:05.688 --> 00:56:08.850]  It's come out for economic data to be given to select corporations.
[00:56:12.046 --> 00:56:21.689]  And now they have Dianne Feinstein and others, I have this in the stack, coming out in the news and saying it doesn't matter if it's illegal, we've got to do this to keep you safe from Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:21.689 --> 00:56:24.349]  Folks, they run Al-Qaeda on record.
[00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:26.270]  Admit I was right, it's public.
[00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:33.392]  The entire training is for gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans, and anyone who is right of linen.
[00:56:34.747 --> 00:56:38.010]  If you want to use that political spectrum as a yardstick.
[00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:40.212]  It's happening, okay?
[00:56:40.212 --> 00:56:43.534]  The army manuals now demonize mainline Christians.
[00:56:43.534 --> 00:56:44.776]  It's happening.
[00:56:44.776 --> 00:56:51.341]  They're trying to get a foothold and sell this takeover and ban free speech and ban it all.
[00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:53.403]  And it's part of a criminal movement.
[00:56:53.403 --> 00:56:54.784]  Here's the toll-free number.
[00:56:54.784 --> 00:56:55.705]  You can get lined up.
[00:56:55.705 --> 00:56:59.128]  I want your take on examples of government lawlessness.
[00:57:00.816 --> 00:57:05.818]  How bad do you think the collapse is going to get that's mathematically certain?
[00:57:05.818 --> 00:57:08.018]  And how do you think we fix things?
[00:57:08.018 --> 00:57:09.119]  Your solutions.
[00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:09.739]  I want to hear them.
[00:57:09.739 --> 00:57:10.379]  Toll-free number 877-789-ALEX.
[00:57:10.379 --> 00:57:10.439]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:10.439 --> 00:57:10.979]  First-time callers only.
[00:57:10.979 --> 00:57:11.239]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:11.239 --> 00:57:14.220]  I want to hear your examples of government lawlessness and corporate lawlessness.
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.961]  See, if you're part of the system, suddenly you're above the law.
[00:57:29.085 --> 00:57:31.068]  Just like the big banks laundering the drug money.
[00:57:31.068 --> 00:57:33.551]  But the cop pulls you over and wants to search your car.
[00:57:33.551 --> 00:57:36.555]  Statistically, that cop's more criminal than the average person.
[00:57:36.555 --> 00:57:37.956]  How about we search your car?
[00:57:37.956 --> 00:57:40.239]  How about you start treating us like free people?
[00:57:40.239 --> 00:57:43.724]  Instead, America's been turned into a bunch of sheep who love to bend over.
[00:57:43.724 --> 00:57:45.446]  And that's why you're being treated like slaves.
[00:57:45.446 --> 00:57:46.787]  Because you act like cowards!
[00:57:46.787 --> 00:57:47.669]  Second hour, coming up!
[00:57:49.938 --> 00:57:52.959]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:57:52.959 --> 00:57:57.962]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:57:57.962 --> 00:58:05.285]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:58:05.285 --> 00:58:09.767]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarsshop.com.
[00:58:10.928 --> 00:58:14.950]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:19.652]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:58:19.652 --> 00:58:25.134]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:28.375]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:58:28.375 --> 00:58:30.876]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:58:30.876 --> 00:58:35.618]  Therosafe, used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:58:35.618 --> 00:58:38.059]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.
[00:58:38.519 --> 00:58:45.727]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWar possible.
[00:58:45.727 --> 00:58:46.988]  We're getting prepared.
[00:58:46.988 --> 00:58:47.669]  Are you?
[00:58:47.669 --> 00:58:49.691]  InfoWarshop.com.
[00:58:49.691 --> 00:58:51.593]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:58:51.593 --> 00:58:55.237]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:58:55.237 --> 00:58:59.801]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:01.203]  You have a system that cuts out the
[00:59:01.323 --> 00:59:05.886]  Sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:59:05.886 --> 00:59:16.672]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:59:16.872 --> 00:59:19.733]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates!
[00:59:19.733 --> 00:59:23.354]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:59:23.354 --> 00:59:38.080]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:39.001]  Coast-to-coast.
[00:59:39.001 --> 00:59:40.862]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:40.862 --> 00:59:43.143]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:01.505 --> 01:00:08.152]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.152 --> 01:00:15.901]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.901 --> 01:00:20.866]  All right, so I kind of went into a rant there, just trying to shake people like a drill sergeant.
[01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:23.693]  Out of their malaise.
[01:00:23.693 --> 01:00:31.724]  Because if you don't get up, if you don't admit you're under attack, if you don't find your survival instinct, you're gonna basically be politically dead and then physically dead.
[01:00:31.724 --> 01:00:35.089]  They're economically bankrupting us, bringing us into serfdom.
[01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:37.372]  You gotta find your killer instinct, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:38.305 --> 01:00:41.106]  And your killer instinct's really your survival instinct.
[01:00:41.106 --> 01:00:43.247]  I don't mean actually go out and kill people.
[01:00:43.247 --> 01:00:46.128]  I'm saying you've got to learn to fight back.
[01:00:46.128 --> 01:00:54.872]  You've got to learn to recognize when you're under attack and not be a coward and roll over, believing that if you get in a fetal position, it's going to make it all better.
[01:00:54.872 --> 01:00:57.133]  We got loaded phone lines here.
[01:00:57.133 --> 01:01:01.174]  I've got to get to the other news because there is just so much of it.
[01:01:01.174 --> 01:01:03.415]  The good, the bad, and the ugly, as they say.
[01:01:03.415 --> 01:01:05.496]  But I really want to hear from callers, folks.
[01:01:07.669 --> 01:01:13.053]  On your examples of the government engaged in this criminal takeover.
[01:01:13.053 --> 01:01:14.114]  Again, I say the government.
[01:01:14.114 --> 01:01:24.242]  It's the membrane through which the criminal interest in the corporate world get away with murder and the public doesn't even know that they're basically the puppeteers.
[01:01:24.242 --> 01:01:27.184]  I want your take on this and I want to hear your ideas for solutions.
[01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:28.926]  I've got a lot of ideas for solutions.
[01:01:30.168 --> 01:01:31.689]  But it's easy to throw out solutions.
[01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:33.270]  I've done that in most of my films.
[01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:34.451]  I talk about it here on air.
[01:01:34.451 --> 01:01:35.632]  Nullification.
[01:01:35.632 --> 01:01:36.413]  Getting healthy.
[01:01:36.413 --> 01:01:37.354]  Getting involved.
[01:01:37.354 --> 01:01:38.815]  Not turning your guns in.
[01:01:38.815 --> 01:01:40.856]  Having a healthy family.
[01:01:40.856 --> 01:01:44.259]  Educating the public.
[01:01:44.259 --> 01:01:45.760]  Suing corrupt government people.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.681]  Standing up to them.
[01:01:46.681 --> 01:01:48.523]  Exercising the First Amendment.
[01:01:48.523 --> 01:01:51.024]  Voting with your dollars for organic, high-quality foods.
[01:01:51.024 --> 01:01:52.406]  Local companies.
[01:01:52.406 --> 01:01:53.266]  Buy America.
[01:01:53.266 --> 01:01:55.568]  None of us are perfect, but buy America as much as you can.
[01:01:55.568 --> 01:01:56.489]  Buy in your own country.
[01:01:58.746 --> 01:02:00.888]  But the biggest thing is waking up folks.
[01:02:00.888 --> 01:02:02.168]  People are upset now.
[01:02:02.168 --> 01:02:10.534]  They know things are going bad, but they're there believing more government's going to save them.
[01:02:10.534 --> 01:02:16.058]  We've got to teach people about the narrative of the New World Order, because that's the real narrative.
[01:02:16.058 --> 01:02:17.079]  That's the game plan.
[01:02:17.079 --> 01:02:22.123]  People know things are wrong, they don't trust the system, but they don't know why it's happening.
[01:02:22.123 --> 01:02:23.524]  They don't know who the enemy is.
[01:02:24.634 --> 01:02:26.875]  Knowing the enemy is half the battle.
[01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:28.116]  And that's not from G.I.
[01:02:28.116 --> 01:02:28.376]  Joe.
[01:02:28.376 --> 01:02:29.657]  That's a military term.
[01:02:29.657 --> 01:02:31.318]  Thousands of years old.
[01:02:31.318 --> 01:02:34.280]  Know thy enemy as thyself.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.360]  Sun Tzu, all of them.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.321]  The Romans, all of it.
[01:02:36.321 --> 01:02:37.902]  It's the same permutations.
[01:02:37.902 --> 01:02:44.066]  If you don't know the enemy, folks, you don't have a chance in a snowball in you know where.
[01:02:44.066 --> 01:02:48.028]  Let's take a phone call before I go to break, and then we'll come back and go to more.
[01:02:48.028 --> 01:02:50.209]  Andy in Tennessee, you're first up out of the box.
[01:02:50.209 --> 01:02:50.569]  Go ahead.
[01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:51.950]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:52.871]  How are you doing?
[01:02:53.473 --> 01:02:54.214]  Pretty freaked out.
[01:02:54.214 --> 01:02:54.954]  Loving my children.
[01:02:54.954 --> 01:02:56.596]  Pretty freaked out about how bad things are.
[01:02:56.596 --> 01:02:57.296]  Right on.
[01:02:57.296 --> 01:02:58.958]  I just want to give you props.
[01:02:58.958 --> 01:03:02.561]  You're a great God-fearing man and that's what it's all about.
[01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:10.789]  We got to put God first and I just wanted to take a moment and step back and take a look at Honda.
[01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:13.871]  They're coming out with new artificial intelligence.
[01:03:13.871 --> 01:03:17.675]  There's a robot called Atlas and what's going to happen when these people
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:23.623]  Are not held accountable for the things that these robots and artificial intelligence do.
[01:03:23.623 --> 01:03:26.845]  Oh, they're already coming out saying the robots will have rights.
[01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:32.369]  Just like if you kill a police dog you get life in prison, but you kill another citizen you get on average about six years in jail.
[01:03:32.369 --> 01:03:37.832]  Because a dog is worth a hundred times what a human is when it's in service to the government.
[01:03:38.983 --> 01:03:41.144]  When it's not, it's no big deal for the government to kill your dog.
[01:03:41.144 --> 01:03:43.784]  You know, a Chihuahua, they feel like if it barks at them.
[01:03:43.784 --> 01:03:49.786]  But, the robots, in fact that's coming up, the robots are going to have more rights than you're going to have.
[01:03:49.786 --> 01:03:52.527]  And you're right, they're coming out with sentinel robots.
[01:03:52.527 --> 01:03:54.408]  I'm going to cover that in the next segment.
[01:03:54.408 --> 01:04:02.830]  Yes sir, and you know if my dog sat on the front porch and bites a mailman, they want to kill my dog and put me behind bars, you know?
[01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:05.171]  So, I just wanted to thank you for
[01:04:06.377 --> 01:04:12.719]  You're looking out to God, and I just want people to wake up.
[01:04:12.719 --> 01:04:14.499]  God bless you, and thanks for putting up with me, brother.
[01:04:14.499 --> 01:04:16.599]  Please, listeners, don't thank me.
[01:04:16.599 --> 01:04:27.622]  You know, Rush Limbaugh has that dittos thing, and I just, people, you know, I should just call in and say, you know, let's all work together, let's keep going, because I want to thank you.
[01:04:27.622 --> 01:04:33.143]  I'm always just burning to get on air, especially when I've been off a few days, and I get on air and don't make half the points I meant to.
[01:04:33.143 --> 01:04:35.424]  We've just got to find our basic instinct of liberty again.
[01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:39.104]  And not be a domesticated creature.
[01:04:39.104 --> 01:04:41.005]  Domestication leads to slaughter.
[01:04:41.005 --> 01:04:44.669]  We want to be free like Mustangs on the plains.
[01:04:44.669 --> 01:04:46.170]  Or like the Comanche.
[01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:52.976]  We do not want to be domesticated by the New World Order because they're eugenicists that are sworn to kill us deader than a hammer.
[01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:55.899]  And people better wake up to the fact you can't choose a side.
[01:04:55.899 --> 01:04:58.001]  The globalists are coming down on everybody.
[01:04:58.001 --> 01:04:58.321]  Everybody.
[01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:05.910]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:08.331]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:05:08.331 --> 01:05:08.751]  The U.S.
[01:05:08.751 --> 01:05:12.973]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:05:12.973 --> 01:05:15.955]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:17.436]  They want that attack to come.
[01:05:17.436 --> 01:05:23.639]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:05:24.008 --> 01:05:26.690]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:31.635]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:05:31.635 --> 01:05:39.081]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:42.143]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:05:42.143 --> 01:05:45.245]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:49.827]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[01:05:49.827 --> 01:05:54.410]  Available only at InfoWarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:16.635]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:06:16.635 --> 01:06:17.856]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:06:17.856 --> 01:06:19.317]  Mao took the guns.
[01:06:19.317 --> 01:06:20.579]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:20.579 --> 01:06:21.699]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:06:21.699 --> 01:06:27.164]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.342]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:44.342 --> 01:06:55.231]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny of the mind of man.
[01:06:55.231 --> 01:06:59.635]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:59.635 --> 01:06:59.835]  Yeah!
[01:06:59.835 --> 01:07:06.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:06.981]  Let me at him!
[01:07:10.148 --> 01:07:12.551]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:07:12.551 --> 01:07:15.795]  Well, I'll tell you, 2013 is ultra long in the old tooth.
[01:07:15.795 --> 01:07:24.225]  Before you know it, it'll be 2014 as we plunge into the future on Spaceship Earth.
[01:07:26.454 --> 01:07:47.899]  By the way, they're saying that that comet that almost plunged into the sun, they thought it had plunged into the sun, is now a zombie comet, because they've never in modern times, since they've had telescopes out, documented one going right by the sun and almost completely being burnt up, with only a small fragment surviving, but it may still be visible in the night sky in the next two to three weeks in December.
[01:07:47.899 --> 01:07:50.159]  So we're going to be telling you some about that.
[01:07:50.159 --> 01:07:52.519]  I've got a huge stack of science news.
[01:07:52.519 --> 01:07:54.620]  Let me just give people these headlines and I'll cover it.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.401]  After I go to your phone calls.
[01:07:57.401 --> 01:07:59.602]  Look at this Times of India report.
[01:07:59.602 --> 01:08:03.344]  Humans emerge from male pig and female chimp.
[01:08:03.344 --> 01:08:05.285]  World's top geneticist says.
[01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:13.983]  Humans are actually hybrids who emerge as an offspring of a male pig and a female chimpanzee, according to one of the world's leading geneticists.
[01:08:13.983 --> 01:08:27.837]  Turning the theory of human ancestry on its head, Dr. Eugene McCarthy, one of the world's leading authorities on hybridization in animals from the University of Georgia, has suggested that humans didn't evolve from just apes, but was a bat-cross hybrid of chimpanzees and pigs.
[01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:30.820]  Folks, these scientists have no idea.
[01:08:31.775 --> 01:08:33.698]  What's actually going on?
[01:08:33.698 --> 01:08:37.102]  If you guys actually click that link on the article, it will take you actually to the Times of India.
[01:08:37.102 --> 01:08:38.424]  I want to show the actual source on that.
[01:08:38.424 --> 01:08:38.704]  Thanks.
[01:08:38.704 --> 01:08:41.208]  I want to show people the image they have there.
[01:08:41.208 --> 01:08:46.154]  That's because... and I don't get into the church's fake debate about evolution not existing.
[01:08:46.955 --> 01:08:55.420]  And then preachers make themselves scientists, and then get into a false debate with other preachers of Darwinism, who then make up a bunch of stuff.
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:09:00.602]  The truth is, things spontaneously basically appear in the fossil record, and that's a fact.
[01:09:00.602 --> 01:09:03.664]  And the theory of evolution as we see it is a fraud.
[01:09:04.304 --> 01:09:07.547]  All the top geneticists are now saying, someone designed this.
[01:09:07.547 --> 01:09:10.149]  Space aliens must have done it, and they have all these theories.
[01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:14.092]  And Prometheus, like the movie Prometheum, it must be like Prometheus.
[01:09:14.092 --> 01:09:22.640]  This is now what the majority of them believe, or that we're crossed with a pig and a chimpanzee, because they're looking at the genetics, and it's not what they said.
[01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:31.093]  And you can breed a tiger with a lion, or a donkey with a horse, because they're so closely related.
[01:09:31.093 --> 01:09:36.776]  And most of the time you'll get a sterile offspring, a mule, or a liger.
[01:09:36.776 --> 01:09:41.018]  But you don't breed chimpanzees with pigs, folks.
[01:09:41.018 --> 01:09:42.138]  I've studied enough genetics.
[01:09:42.138 --> 01:09:46.180]  That is total, absolute bull.
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:50.022]  That is like saying that a shark is going to breed with a halibut.
[01:09:51.869 --> 01:09:54.531]  I mean, those are even closer related, and they can't even mate.
[01:09:54.531 --> 01:09:59.434]  I mean, this is just absolute, total bull.
[01:09:59.434 --> 01:10:01.736]  So, there you go, they're changing.
[01:10:01.736 --> 01:10:12.723]  But, you know, they still teach in public schools the theory of evolution from 150 years ago, showing babies in utero with gills, which isn't true.
[01:10:12.723 --> 01:10:14.644]  I mean, they don't care.
[01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:15.405]  They don't care.
[01:10:15.405 --> 01:10:16.305]  Why not?
[01:10:16.305 --> 01:10:18.106]  Tell people Obamacare gave you free healthcare.
[01:10:18.106 --> 01:10:18.587]  It isn't true!
[01:10:19.773 --> 01:10:22.494]  People think... Anyways, I'm ranting.
[01:10:22.494 --> 01:10:23.154]  That's just one article.
[01:10:23.154 --> 01:10:24.535]  Let me give you some of the other articles.
[01:10:24.535 --> 01:10:25.856]  Look at this out of the Daily Mail.
[01:10:25.856 --> 01:10:30.457]  Dial 000000 for Armageddon.
[01:10:30.457 --> 01:10:30.798]  U.S.
[01:10:30.798 --> 01:10:36.420]  top-secret launch nuclear code was frighteningly simple.
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:36.900]  That's right.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:41.122]  That was the designation during the Cold War for the nuclear football.
[01:10:41.122 --> 01:10:45.804]  The launch codes for the president to give the authorization to destroy the planet, basically, was 000000.
[01:10:50.407 --> 01:10:52.327]  That's hard to figure out.
[01:10:52.327 --> 01:10:56.808]  And continuing here, is it okay to torture or murder a robot?
[01:10:56.808 --> 01:11:00.489]  BBC reports they're now going to launch robots as police.
[01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:02.310]  In fact, that's now being done.
[01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:11.452]  And so they want to make it where you'll get life in prison for hurting one of their robots, but if the police kill you, a slave, surf, it'll be, they'll get a medal.
[01:11:11.452 --> 01:11:12.612]  I like drone pilots.
[01:11:12.612 --> 01:11:16.533]  And here it is out of the New York Times, coming soon, a night watchman with wheels.
[01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:26.017]  That's right, rolling robots that look like R2-D2, spying on you, bossing you around, face scanning you, and then they can call in the drones.
[01:11:26.017 --> 01:11:29.239]  And then the really important news, is it safe?
[01:11:29.239 --> 01:11:32.720]  Radioactive Japanese wave nears US.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.621]  That was like when I was watching a press conference back when Bush was in office.
[01:11:36.621 --> 01:11:37.142]  Bush 43.
[01:11:37.142 --> 01:11:39.883]  They were asking Perino,
[01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:46.500]  We're asking the spokeswoman, the press secretary, is it true there's been some dollar devaluation?
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:55.954]  Of course, you could just look at the numbers on the world market and see the dollar was being devalued, and she'd say, I'm not going to comment on monetary issues.
[01:11:58.188 --> 01:12:16.286]  Like, is it true the sun came up this morning, and they're like, is it a problem that finally after two and a half years, the radioactive wave of junk and garbage, highly radioactive, you've already seen a five-fold increase in places in San Diego, the amount of radiation in the tuna and things like that, now the main wave is about to hit
[01:12:16.926 --> 01:12:20.330]  Early next year, and they say, is it dangerous?
[01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:28.599]  In the wake of the deadly tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 and severely damaged nuclear reactor, it's Reactors, five of the six.
[01:12:28.599 --> 01:12:30.140]  Get that straight, Fox News.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:34.785]  Japanese officials, not servants, say that the level of radiation are safe for everyone.
[01:12:35.766 --> 01:12:43.610]  Outside the reactor itself, but as radioactive water from the plant nears the west coast of North America, the water is expected to hit in 2014.
[01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:45.230]  Can we be sure it's safe?
[01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:49.452]  But the government says it's very safe and good for you.
[01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:49.873]  That's right.
[01:12:49.873 --> 01:12:54.415]  In fact, Ann Coulter says the Japanese should be thankful for the increased radiation.
[01:12:54.415 --> 01:12:56.836]  I think she should go live in the shattered reactor.
[01:12:56.836 --> 01:13:00.798]  Most of the rescue team that helped try to contain it, they're all dead now, but most of them are dead.
[01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:04.551]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:05.712]  Radiation's good for you.
[01:13:05.712 --> 01:13:07.454]  Mother's milk's bad.
[01:13:07.454 --> 01:13:08.515]  Big government's dangerous.
[01:13:08.515 --> 01:13:10.376]  George Washington said it, I know.
[01:13:10.376 --> 01:13:12.198]  Oh, I'm that wild guy.
[01:13:12.198 --> 01:13:16.101]  Oh boy, I'm saying radiation at high levels is bad for you.
[01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:25.289]  I mean, the International Atomic Energy Agency admits that Chernobyl from 1986 killed over a million people in the aggregate from tumors.
[01:13:25.289 --> 01:13:27.191]  But hey, what's a million dead?
[01:13:29.301 --> 01:13:30.881]  I apologize for being extreme.
[01:13:30.881 --> 01:13:32.002]  The radiation's good.
[01:13:32.002 --> 01:13:35.223]  Just drink all the salt water, eat the fish, everything's fine.
[01:13:35.223 --> 01:13:37.403]  Okay there, I'm a mainstream broadcaster now.
[01:13:37.403 --> 01:13:40.044]  Alright, everything's fine.
[01:13:40.044 --> 01:13:45.865]  Obamacare works great, and of course the new website didn't work again, but they'll just tell you it did work, like they've been doing for two months, and everything's fine.
[01:13:45.865 --> 01:13:47.406]  Okay, the site works great.
[01:13:47.406 --> 01:13:50.847]  And Obama didn't hire any lobbyists, and uh...
[01:13:51.843 --> 01:13:53.624]  He lied about everything, but that's okay.
[01:13:53.624 --> 01:13:54.724]  Okay.
[01:13:54.724 --> 01:13:58.226]  Continuing here with the news, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:58.226 --> 01:14:02.908]  Obviously, actually, people are awake to what's going on, but they don't realize how bad it is.
[01:14:02.908 --> 01:14:05.489]  And here's the latest Gallup poll that I mentioned earlier.
[01:14:05.489 --> 01:14:07.289]  I'll show this to you for the Washington Examiner.
[01:14:07.289 --> 01:14:12.091]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com, as well as PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:14:12.091 --> 01:14:13.532]  New low for Congress.
[01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.393]  Just 6% approved.
[01:14:15.393 --> 01:14:17.794]  Finally lower than car salespeople.
[01:14:19.178 --> 01:14:22.740]  Was previously 10%, now it's 6%.
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.662]  And isn't that just sweet?
[01:14:24.662 --> 01:14:27.484]  In God we trust, maybe, but not each other.
[01:14:27.484 --> 01:14:32.787]  The same poll out shows a record low of folks trusting each other.
[01:14:32.787 --> 01:14:36.610]  Continuing here, inside the Race to Rescue healthcare site, and Obama.
[01:14:37.685 --> 01:14:39.346]  Like, like, like, like Obama did it.
[01:14:39.346 --> 01:14:41.146]  It's not like foreign banks did it.
[01:14:41.146 --> 01:14:42.707]  Oh, and here it is out of the Telegraph.
[01:14:42.707 --> 01:14:55.412]  Media attacks Obama's Soviet-style publicity policy where they don't do press conferences or they only take prearranged questions and only do photo ops now because they don't even need you anymore.
[01:14:55.412 --> 01:14:57.293]  No one watches state-run media.
[01:14:57.293 --> 01:14:58.954]  So why shouldn't they just put the press release?
[01:14:58.954 --> 01:15:05.877]  In fact, they've now come out in the last five years with the CIA program where they put a press release in and then it rewrites it a hundred different ways.
[01:15:07.213 --> 01:15:08.574]  To make it look like people wrote it.
[01:15:08.574 --> 01:15:10.095]  They put a fake name on it.
[01:15:10.095 --> 01:15:17.641]  And a lot of the news you see now, and a lot of the witnesses and people they have in government articles, are totally made up.
[01:15:17.641 --> 01:15:18.482]  I'm not kidding.
[01:15:18.482 --> 01:15:19.182]  You think I'm joking.
[01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:20.683]  Look it up.
[01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:25.327]  Just type in CIA creates fake writing programs.
[01:15:25.327 --> 01:15:28.089]  Fake journalism programs.
[01:15:28.089 --> 01:15:29.370]  Continuing here.
[01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:30.831]  Everything's going to automation.
[01:15:30.831 --> 01:15:32.212]  Drones that are automated.
[01:15:32.212 --> 01:15:32.793]  Robots.
[01:15:32.793 --> 01:15:33.974]  You're not needed anymore.
[01:15:33.974 --> 01:15:34.914]  Drink fluoride.
[01:15:34.914 --> 01:15:35.895]  Drink deep.
[01:15:35.895 --> 01:15:36.415]  They love you.
[01:15:37.386 --> 01:15:43.209]  Doesn't matter that every globalist white paper says they're creating a technocracy to slowly poison everyone and then kill us en masse.
[01:15:43.209 --> 01:15:44.109]  That's scary.
[01:15:44.109 --> 01:15:45.430]  It's obviously not true.
[01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:46.550]  Government loves you.
[01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:47.351]  Drink fluoride.
[01:15:47.351 --> 01:15:49.412]  Take extra shots.
[01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:56.815]  When you go into Walgreens or CVS and they give you a discount for taking the shot, it's because it's good for you, and they love you, and they want to help you.
[01:15:56.815 --> 01:15:57.996]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:00.615 --> 01:16:06.096]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:16:06.096 --> 01:16:14.979]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:16:14.979 --> 01:16:22.801]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:16:22.801 --> 01:16:30.203]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[01:16:59.679 --> 01:17:04.405]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:17:04.405 --> 01:17:07.509]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:17:07.509 --> 01:17:13.076]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:17:13.076 --> 01:17:14.678]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:16.639]  We are what we eat.
[01:17:16.639 --> 01:17:21.322]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:17:21.322 --> 01:17:25.525]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:17:25.525 --> 01:17:28.087]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:17:28.087 --> 01:17:34.331]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:18:05.582 --> 01:18:10.104]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:18:10.104 --> 01:18:16.226]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:18:16.226 --> 01:18:27.010]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:30.091]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates!

[01:18:52.456 --> 01:19:02.860]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:07.882]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:19:07.882 --> 01:19:15.065]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:19:15.185 --> 01:19:20.830]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:24.854]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:19:24.854 --> 01:19:29.578]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:19:29.578 --> 01:19:34.803]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:19:35.043 --> 01:19:38.285]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:19:38.285 --> 01:19:40.787]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:19:40.787 --> 01:19:45.550]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:48.432]  Hand cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:19:48.432 --> 01:19:55.636]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our Info War possible.
[01:19:55.636 --> 01:19:56.917]  We're getting prepared.
[01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:57.578]  Are you?
[01:19:57.578 --> 01:19:58.358]  InfoWarshop.com
[01:20:01.007 --> 01:20:04.610]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:18.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:24.964]  It's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[01:20:24.964 --> 01:20:28.247]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not
[01:20:29.557 --> 01:20:31.037]  That's world record BS.
[01:20:31.037 --> 01:20:33.058]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:33.058 --> 01:20:34.178]  That's right folks.
[01:20:54.005 --> 01:20:58.128]  And Obama says 100 million people have signed up for Obamacare even though it's less than 10,000.
[01:20:58.128 --> 01:21:01.111]  Doesn't matter.
[01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:04.534]  I'm a conspiracy theorist because I question known liars.
[01:21:04.534 --> 01:21:06.375]  So I'm gonna be mainstream broadcaster.
[01:21:06.375 --> 01:21:08.077]  I agree 100 million signed up.
[01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:14.353]  It's good the Army's being trained in official manuals that George Washington was bad and gun owners are bad.
[01:21:14.353 --> 01:21:19.735]  You can just type in, Army manual demonizes gun owners and George Washington, you'll get mainstream news.
[01:21:19.735 --> 01:21:21.536]  And I agree, I think that's normal.
[01:21:21.536 --> 01:21:23.657]  I feel real good about the government doing that.
[01:21:23.657 --> 01:21:26.458]  Because George Washington was a bad person.
[01:21:27.807 --> 01:21:31.230]  If you just tuned in, I'm being sarcastic about George Washington being a bad person.
[01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:33.992]  I'm not being sarcastic about those army manuals.
[01:21:33.992 --> 01:21:37.375]  And when we pointed out first the media attacks us, it goes, what's the big deal?
[01:21:37.375 --> 01:21:41.018]  And later, well, I guess, I guess we'll stop teaching that.
[01:21:41.018 --> 01:21:47.323]  It shows how whacked out freakazoid the people are that are running the system.
[01:21:47.323 --> 01:21:50.906]  And I'm normal because I'm freaked out about it, folks.
[01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:52.047]  And I want to do something about it.
[01:21:54.266 --> 01:21:59.108]  I'm real mad about three new coal power plants a week in China as they shut down on average three a week here or more.
[01:21:59.108 --> 01:22:05.050]  Because I know our number one source of power, 52%, is coal.
[01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:06.751]  And I know our power prices are going up.
[01:22:06.751 --> 01:22:09.332]  And for me, that just hurts my pocketbook.
[01:22:09.332 --> 01:22:13.474]  For a lot of poor folks, that wrecks their lives!
[01:22:13.474 --> 01:22:18.936]  And I know they're doing that so nobody can compete in America, and you gotta move to China!
[01:22:18.936 --> 01:22:21.497]  And that gets me hopping angry, cheating Americans!
[01:22:23.663 --> 01:22:27.785]  Bunch of globalists playing games!
[01:22:27.785 --> 01:22:35.008]  And I get real angry when the Dallas mayor says no free speech, no rallies allowed for four days in Dallas on the 50th anniversary.
[01:22:35.008 --> 01:22:42.531]  So I go up there and for three days I go, well good job Dallas police for being in America, not arresting me even though the mayor said to.
[01:22:42.531 --> 01:22:45.072]  We'll work with you and won't bullhorn during the ceremonies and stuff.
[01:22:46.072 --> 01:22:53.578]  And then the Feds just sent in the Dallas Sheriff's Department to punch people in the face and beat people up and grab me around the neck and everything else.
[01:22:53.578 --> 01:22:55.999]  And they all look like thugs who hated us.
[01:22:55.999 --> 01:22:57.901]  They hated Americans!
[01:22:57.901 --> 01:22:59.082]  They hated freedom!
[01:22:59.082 --> 01:23:01.243]  They hated the shield of liberty!
[01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:05.446]  If I'd have been standing in Walmart wanting some slave good, beating somebody up.
[01:23:05.446 --> 01:23:09.469]  There's video of women beating each other up and men beating each other up.
[01:23:09.469 --> 01:23:10.930]  And the cops don't stop them.
[01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:14.553]  They come over and try to take the camera of the guy that filmed it.
[01:23:17.918 --> 01:23:22.361]  I mean, there's video out of a woman ran off the road into the edge of water.
[01:23:22.361 --> 01:23:23.241]  She ended up dying.
[01:23:23.241 --> 01:23:26.463]  She drowned after they got her out.
[01:23:26.463 --> 01:23:32.646]  And the cop stands there and said, I'm not getting wet that the videos on Infowars.com and five other men dig them out.
[01:23:32.646 --> 01:23:36.308]  And I guess the word is they're gonna try to give the men that tried to save the women tickets.
[01:23:36.308 --> 01:23:40.270]  That's like this new thing that they do where
[01:23:44.594 --> 01:23:53.062]  If a lifeguard, a city lifeguard goes one foot over the line of the city property at the beach to save somebody, they get arrested.
[01:23:53.062 --> 01:23:57.065]  I mean, this is a government for itself, by itself, period.
[01:23:57.065 --> 01:24:01.469]  So incredibly disgusting.
[01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:02.831]  A cop that won't render aid.
[01:24:04.445 --> 01:24:06.466]  Because that's who they want.
[01:24:06.466 --> 01:24:07.787]  It's come out that the L.A.
[01:24:07.787 --> 01:24:10.328]  Sheriff's Department fires criminals on purpose.
[01:24:10.328 --> 01:24:11.228]  Of course they do!
[01:24:11.228 --> 01:24:14.530]  I mean, I know hardcore convicts when I see them, folks.
[01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:17.131]  I'll guarantee you, those were hardened crooks.
[01:24:17.131 --> 01:24:19.973]  A bunch of them that were in the Sheriff's Department.
[01:24:19.973 --> 01:24:23.414]  I had a buddy who was in the Army call me and go, man, that was my drill sergeant.
[01:24:23.414 --> 01:24:23.855]  One of those guys.
[01:24:23.855 --> 01:24:25.355]  That guy was horrible.
[01:24:25.355 --> 01:24:27.436]  He was the worst guy at the base.
[01:24:27.436 --> 01:24:28.157]  Totally evil.
[01:24:29.167 --> 01:24:30.790]  Now he was in command of those people.
[01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:31.971]  I even know his name.
[01:24:31.971 --> 01:24:33.033]  That's who they've got.
[01:24:33.033 --> 01:24:36.137]  Units of literal trash!
[01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:37.039]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:24:37.039 --> 01:24:38.261]  I gotta shut up and go to your calls.
[01:24:39.778 --> 01:24:41.780]  It's just that get your instinct back.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.441]  Stop lying down.
[01:24:43.441 --> 01:24:45.242]  We're in trouble, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:45.242 --> 01:24:46.524]  I'm going to take calls the rest of the show.
[01:24:46.524 --> 01:24:48.585]  I got a little bit of NSA news to hit.
[01:24:48.585 --> 01:24:52.508]  I haven't plugged anything yet, but I've got 12 calls on the line.
[01:24:52.508 --> 01:24:54.170]  That's what this current phone system takes.
[01:24:54.170 --> 01:25:00.295]  When you hear somebody hang up, it's your chance to call in at 877-789-2539.
[01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:06.680]  Kathy and Chris and Sully and Tony and Ben and Laura and John and Eric and Alan and Bibi and Lola and Daniel and everybody else, we're going to get to you.
[01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:11.894]  But separately, before I take your calls, I want to just tell people a couple things.
[01:25:11.894 --> 01:25:16.358]  I put out a magazine at cost, because as print dies, we go into print.
[01:25:16.358 --> 01:25:17.960]  We dominate the web, we go into print.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.561]  It's been very successful getting the word out.
[01:25:19.561 --> 01:25:23.886]  Big color, glossy magazine, 64 pages.
[01:25:23.886 --> 01:25:25.647]  And it's got a bunch of dinosaurs.
[01:25:25.647 --> 01:25:31.092]  One's CNN, one's MSNBC, one's CBS, out there on the green field as the comment comes in to kill them.
[01:25:32.267 --> 01:25:34.508]  And the comments named new media.
[01:25:34.508 --> 01:25:36.748]  And they have no idea what's about to hit them.
[01:25:36.748 --> 01:25:39.689]  And this whole issue is just really bombshell.
[01:25:39.689 --> 01:25:42.390]  It is the latest issue, now out and available.
[01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:43.530]  Great to give friends and family.
[01:25:43.530 --> 01:25:45.891]  You can get these in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost.
[01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:47.272]  Or give somebody a gift subscription.
[01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:49.672]  Great to do this Christmas season.
[01:25:49.672 --> 01:25:50.733]  Ooh, I'm politically incorrect.
[01:25:50.733 --> 01:25:51.913]  This Christmas season.
[01:25:54.065 --> 01:26:03.536]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, it is the December 2013 issue, and it is a great way to wake people up.
[01:26:03.536 --> 01:26:08.782]  It is a great way to take action and to reach out to people, and it covers a whole bunch.
[01:26:09.563 --> 01:26:13.164]  Of really, really key issues across the board.
[01:26:13.164 --> 01:26:16.625]  And it's got good-looking women with .50 caliber rifles firing them as well.
[01:26:16.625 --> 01:26:17.105]  Things like that.
[01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:21.067]  And they're really evil, you know, male-type stuff is in there.
[01:26:21.067 --> 01:26:22.247]  Just real Americana.
[01:26:22.247 --> 01:26:27.989]  It gets into all the proctology exams police are doing under federal orders all over the road.
[01:26:27.989 --> 01:26:29.989]  It's just, I mean, the magazine covers it all.
[01:26:29.989 --> 01:26:34.311]  And it's available at infowarestore.com.
[01:26:34.311 --> 01:26:38.492]  And it's big, glossy magazines you can buy in bulk to give out to people to wake them up.
[01:26:40.484 --> 01:26:44.728]  After you're done reading them, or give a 12-issue gift subscription.
[01:26:44.728 --> 01:26:50.134]  We're running a special right now, 30% off on the gift subscriptions at infowarstore.com.
[01:26:50.134 --> 01:26:52.957]  And lastly, I'm going to put a video out this week explaining it.
[01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:54.418]  It's the best coffee I've ever had.
[01:26:54.418 --> 01:27:01.426]  I found I was able to private label it at a lower price, about 45% lower price than when I was buying it at retail.
[01:27:02.046 --> 01:27:07.809]  It is Wake Up America, Patriot Blend, Arabica, Shade Grown, High Mountains, Chiapas, Mexico.
[01:27:07.809 --> 01:27:10.310]  It's better than Guatemalan, which is my previous favorite.
[01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:13.772]  Took me two years to get this deal done, directly from the folks.
[01:27:13.772 --> 01:27:15.233]  It's total fair trade.
[01:27:15.233 --> 01:27:22.577]  It's co-op level, Oregon Tilt, highest level of organic certification, roasted in Colorado by Patriots.
[01:27:22.577 --> 01:27:24.078]  There's photos on the site, the people literally
[01:27:24.938 --> 01:27:29.002]  Their giant coffee roasting machines have Infowars.com on them.
[01:27:29.002 --> 01:27:30.964]  Before I was buying stuff from them.
[01:27:30.964 --> 01:27:31.345]  It's funny.
[01:27:31.345 --> 01:27:32.866]  I finally found out where I could get it.
[01:27:32.866 --> 01:27:34.267]  They were already listeners.
[01:27:34.267 --> 01:27:37.210]  So, match made in heaven, lovingly roasted in America.
[01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:40.093]  Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com.
[01:27:40.093 --> 01:27:41.955]  And we have the immune support.
[01:27:41.955 --> 01:27:45.679]  It also has these amazing mushrooms infused, shown to boost immune system.
[01:27:45.679 --> 01:27:48.502]  And we have the nascent iodine, special atomic iodine.
[01:27:49.362 --> 01:28:00.072]  That is a certified, patented, special type that uses sound wave technology unlike anything you've ever had for the thyroid, the rest of the body, with all that radiation hitting the West Coast.
[01:28:00.072 --> 01:28:04.456]  That's why I ended up getting this product because nobody even knew about it and I was seeing what I could do for my family.
[01:28:04.456 --> 01:28:05.357]  Infowarslife.com

[01:28:26.316 --> 01:28:28.057]  You can just link through the shopping cart there.

[01:28:29.358 --> 01:28:31.140]  Not like NPR with taxpayer money.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.562]  Not like MSNBC with stimulus money.
[01:28:33.562 --> 01:28:37.506]  It's free association, free market, high quality products that I personally...
[01:28:38.829 --> 01:28:39.109]  Use.

[01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:40.330]  Believe in.
[01:28:40.330 --> 01:28:40.891]  ProPure.
[01:28:40.891 --> 01:28:42.332]  Best gravity-fed system.
[01:28:42.332 --> 01:28:43.453]  Water filters.
[01:28:43.453 --> 01:28:47.576]  20% off promo code WATER20.
[01:28:47.576 --> 01:28:50.658]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:58.204]  I promise, when we come back, I'm going directly to your calls on solutions to turn this around and the lawlessness of the rogue government.
[01:28:59.991 --> 01:29:10.674]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:29:10.674 --> 01:29:12.735]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:29:12.735 --> 01:29:13.615]  Fluoride!
[01:29:13.615 --> 01:29:15.336]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:15.336 --> 01:29:15.416]  In 1924,
[01:29:16.656 --> 01:29:22.097]  The federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:29:22.097 --> 01:29:27.018]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:29:27.018 --> 01:29:33.340]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.761]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:38.701]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:29:38.701 --> 01:29:42.062]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:29:42.202 --> 01:29:47.628]  You'll find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:29:47.628 --> 01:29:52.733]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:29:52.733 --> 01:29:53.934]  I take it every day.
[01:29:53.934 --> 01:29:56.797]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:30:00.416 --> 01:30:07.638]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:30:07.638 --> 01:30:25.224]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:31.691]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:30:31.691 --> 01:30:39.861]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:30:39.861 --> 01:30:41.283]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[01:30:43.385 --> 01:30:46.146]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.

[01:31:09.713 --> 01:31:16.298]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:31:16.298 --> 01:31:19.641]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert.
[01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:21.983]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:31:21.983 --> 01:31:25.685]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.

[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.962]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:31:47.962 --> 01:31:54.807]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:31:54.807 --> 01:31:59.049]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:07.204]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:32:07.204 --> 01:32:09.626]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:32:09.626 --> 01:32:10.046]  The U.S.
[01:32:10.046 --> 01:32:14.269]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:32:14.269 --> 01:32:17.231]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:18.732]  They want that attack to come.
[01:32:18.732 --> 01:32:24.936]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:32:25.305 --> 01:32:27.967]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:32:27.967 --> 01:32:32.930]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:40.375]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:32:40.695 --> 01:32:43.436]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:32:43.436 --> 01:32:46.538]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:32:46.538 --> 01:32:51.100]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[01:33:04.606 --> 01:33:07.807]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:12.028 --> 01:33:15.034]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:15.034 --> 01:33:19.783]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:22.116 --> 01:33:23.837]  Waging war on corruption!
[01:33:23.837 --> 01:33:25.337]  You know, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:33:25.337 --> 01:33:26.397]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:26.397 --> 01:33:29.298]  Central, Lord willing, with a weekday broadcast.
[01:33:29.298 --> 01:33:33.760]  You can find all the details, free podcasts, audio streams, video streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.761]  Okay, I've been hogging the time.
[01:33:35.761 --> 01:33:37.621]  I appreciate all the callers holding.
[01:33:37.621 --> 01:33:39.162]  I'm gonna go to your calls right now.
[01:33:39.162 --> 01:33:41.583]  And for those that just joined us, I'm asking the listeners...
[01:33:42.603 --> 01:33:48.145]  I use the example of police under federal grants confiscating legal firearms all over the country.
[01:33:48.145 --> 01:33:51.986]  Carpet cleaners at your house sees a gun case, doesn't like it, cops come take them.
[01:33:51.986 --> 01:33:54.306]  Just say, our policy is we want to take your guns.
[01:33:54.306 --> 01:33:56.127]  And they don't give them back.
[01:33:56.127 --> 01:33:59.688]  This is ammo land and the NRA reporting on this.
[01:33:59.688 --> 01:34:03.709]  And it's just an example of how government does whatever it wants now.
[01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:05.269]  Because it's regulating itself.
[01:34:05.269 --> 01:34:07.070]  That's called tyranny.
[01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:10.151]  What are your examples of government tyranny and government being above the law?
[01:34:11.127 --> 01:34:14.169]  And then what are your ideas of solutions to turn this around?
[01:34:14.169 --> 01:34:16.871]  Or have we passed the point of no return?
[01:34:16.871 --> 01:34:21.814]  Let's go to Kathy, Sully, Tony, Ben, Laura, John, Eric, Alan, BB, Lola, and others.
[01:34:21.814 --> 01:34:23.015]  I'm going to you right now.
[01:34:23.015 --> 01:34:26.217]  Kathy in North Carolina, thanks for holding.
[01:34:26.217 --> 01:34:27.938]  Sure.
[01:34:27.938 --> 01:34:32.101]  Well, the examples I can think of where the government thinks it's against the law
[01:34:33.573 --> 01:34:34.334]  I don't know.
[01:34:48.832 --> 01:34:55.036]  Uh, you know, and they obviously, if someone connects the dots, are not our friends there.
[01:34:55.036 --> 01:34:57.358]  See, you might as well be speaking Martian, though.
[01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:58.879]  You're totally informed.
[01:34:58.879 --> 01:35:02.802]  You know about the public law where they claim they can do lethal testing on us.
[01:35:02.802 --> 01:35:04.703]  It was for law enforcement or research.
[01:35:04.703 --> 01:35:08.986]  They have on the books they can kill us for research purposes in the U.S.
[01:35:08.986 --> 01:35:09.807]  Code.
[01:35:09.807 --> 01:35:10.888]  You just gave that out.
[01:35:10.888 --> 01:35:12.669]  The average lawyer doesn't know how to look that up.
[01:35:13.369 --> 01:35:22.093]  You just talked about the geoengineering that's declassified, spraying aluminum dioxide on us, and the average person does not even know what you're talking about.
[01:35:22.093 --> 01:35:26.334]  The NDAA, where they can secretly arrest you, torture you, and kill you.
[01:35:26.334 --> 01:35:31.616]  Obama should have been instantly impeached when he signed that December 31st, 2011.
[01:35:31.616 --> 01:35:39.180]  The average person doesn't know what that is, and thinks you're bad because you know information.
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:39.740]  Right.
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:40.440]  Yeah.
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.621]  And so, to me it seems like
[01:35:43.803 --> 01:35:50.767]  Well, certainly trying to vote the right person in, what choices we get, anyways, is not the answer.
[01:35:50.767 --> 01:35:59.372]  And it seems like one problem is, for the Wuerl family to act as one, we have the language barrier that kind of puts a crimp in that.
[01:35:59.372 --> 01:36:10.018]  But if we had, if we communicated to each other with pictures, like for instance, I know they're putting billboards up, getting donations for billboards about chemtrails and different things.
[01:36:10.894 --> 01:36:27.399]  If it was on the internet and we used pictures, like there's a company called, I don't know if I can say it, I'm not trying to advertise with them, but if we use pictures for a language and try to all come up with an action... You know, it's funny you're saying this.
[01:36:27.399 --> 01:36:39.623]  I want to come up with an image of people listening to a radio, then a TV, then a computer, then a smartphone, then Google Glasses, then brain ports, then the brain replaced with machinery.
[01:36:40.163 --> 01:36:42.705]  Electronics and then it we're not human anymore.
[01:36:42.705 --> 01:36:47.228]  You could show that in pictures to show people the actual plan great points.
[01:36:47.228 --> 01:36:49.950]  We're going I'm trying to get a graphic screw together.
[01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:57.194]  I'm trying to get more money into our more people so that we can realize all that and get across the language barrier.
[01:36:57.194 --> 01:37:00.156]  I was jogging this morning and had that epiphany pictures.
[01:37:00.156 --> 01:37:00.877]  We've got to put out.
[01:37:02.029 --> 01:37:02.389]  Hello?
[01:37:02.389 --> 01:37:04.651]  Okay, sorry, it was a little static before you got on.
[01:37:32.489 --> 01:37:39.093]  So, you talked about, like, to name some things that corporations are doing.
[01:37:39.093 --> 01:37:40.393]  One, well, and government.
[01:37:40.393 --> 01:37:43.975]  One of the biggest ones, obviously, is Fast and Furious.
[01:37:43.975 --> 01:37:50.499]  But one of the ones that's not as well known is, and I forgot what the name of the actual statute was, but
[01:37:50.979 --> 01:37:51.880]  I don't think so.
[01:38:05.816 --> 01:38:16.798]  Actually, sir, that was North Carolina EPA secret programs to literally do secret lethal human experimentation that broke this year.
[01:38:16.798 --> 01:38:21.139]  In fact, David Knight, a group he was involved with in North Carolina, actually broke that.
[01:38:21.139 --> 01:38:22.679]  Yes, you're right.
[01:38:22.679 --> 01:38:23.079]  Right.
[01:38:23.079 --> 01:38:33.981]  So, I mean, that's an example of the government just being allowed to do something like that and nobody really saying or doing anything about it.
[01:38:34.614 --> 01:38:37.546]  But you asked for solutions, really?
[01:38:38.482 --> 01:38:44.043]  The best solution, and I hate to sound corny, but honestly the best solution is just freedom.
[01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:45.023]  You know?
[01:38:45.023 --> 01:38:46.264]  And what do I mean by that?
[01:38:46.264 --> 01:38:59.846]  Meaning that the more people know about actually what's going on and the more they're free to create their own solutions as to what to do that are, you know, healthy and non-violent and etc.
[01:38:59.846 --> 01:39:02.667]  The more creative and the more exciting it becomes.
[01:39:02.667 --> 01:39:03.587]  I totally agree.
[01:39:03.587 --> 01:39:04.247]  I totally agree.
[01:39:04.247 --> 01:39:06.488]  And more and more I think we should do all this
[01:39:07.188 --> 01:39:18.837]  Instead of me having to hire people, train them, figure it all out, deal with it, deal with all the interpersonal stuff that comes with management, because I have a great team now, but it's been hard to develop them, you know, find the right people.
[01:39:18.837 --> 01:39:28.024]  I need to have more contests where we have contests by graphic artists on different subjects to then put out a coffee table book to finance the paying of the artist.
[01:39:29.295 --> 01:39:40.643]  But then put it out online for free on like ten subjects worldwide, the final chapter showing human unity against the breakaway civilization.
[01:39:40.643 --> 01:39:55.314]  And the Globalist in literally hundreds of white papers going back over a hundred years ago said they would create a breakaway technocracy siphoning off our tax money behind a national security state to then build this advanced civilization
[01:39:55.734 --> 01:40:01.237]  Where the elite are so advanced from us, it's like gods to insects, is the way they describe it.
[01:40:01.237 --> 01:40:07.941]  And they're building what Eisenhower warned of, the scientific technological elite is in control of the military-industrial complex.
[01:40:07.941 --> 01:40:09.182]  That's the full quote.
[01:40:09.182 --> 01:40:16.145]  And they are literally, literally building a dehumanization grid.
[01:40:16.145 --> 01:40:16.866]  God bless you, sir.
[01:40:16.866 --> 01:40:17.466]  Good to hear from you.
[01:40:17.466 --> 01:40:18.547]  Let's go to another caller.
[01:40:18.547 --> 01:40:19.767]  Laura in Wisconsin.
[01:40:19.767 --> 01:40:20.328]  You're on the air.
[01:40:21.067 --> 01:40:21.747]  Well, hi there!
[01:40:21.747 --> 01:40:23.728]  Hi!
[01:40:23.728 --> 01:40:33.149]  Well, you asked for solutions and you also asked about the lawlessness, but I think some people don't realize the incrementalness of it, the micromanagement of what's happening.
[01:40:33.149 --> 01:40:45.072]  Just here in western Wisconsin, we're having issues with being pulled over over legalities and people don't think about, oh it's just a cop, you know, I'm just being pulled over by a cop and he'll go away and if he doesn't give me a ticket then everything's okay.
[01:40:45.732 --> 01:40:47.074]  No, no, it's first contact.
[01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:56.564]  They're getting people not used to police, who aren't criminals, used to being in the system so that you won't flinch when they pull you over and take you away to the FEMA camp and the cop himself doesn't know.
[01:40:56.564 --> 01:41:00.668]  That's why they have checkpoints now to check to see if your license is in order.
[01:41:00.668 --> 01:41:01.729]  Totally unconstitutional.
[01:41:03.874 --> 01:41:05.095]  Sorry ma'am, go ahead.
[01:41:05.095 --> 01:41:20.872]  Well, what they've done here now is that you can legally register your vehicle even if you don't have a driver's license and my husband is a disabled non-driver and I get pulled over constantly in a vehicle because he has the registration because it's a legal registration but they're checking who the driver is.
[01:41:21.718 --> 01:41:23.839]  Yeah, and that's a total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:41:23.839 --> 01:41:25.941]  The illegal aliens are all legalized.
[01:41:25.941 --> 01:41:28.583]  Obama by fiat has legalized basically all of them.
[01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:29.723]  It's total fraud.
[01:41:29.723 --> 01:41:37.509]  The system is a fraud, and the police are being trained to make contact with the public, get us used to contact.
[01:41:37.509 --> 01:41:43.433]  There are actual army psychological warfare films from the 60s that are online.
[01:41:43.433 --> 01:41:46.795]  We've played clips of them where they show how to dominate a public.
[01:41:46.795 --> 01:41:48.036]  It's everything they're doing here.
[01:41:50.171 --> 01:42:04.375]  And as far as like a solution, one of the biggest things I think is to, I mean, our generation and the generation before us and the generation before us, I'm a little older than you are Alex, we're probably, the other people out there, the sheeple, are done.
[01:42:04.375 --> 01:42:06.195]  I mean, there's nothing we can really do for them, I don't think.
[01:42:06.195 --> 01:42:07.276]  There's maybe a few more to wake up.
[01:42:07.276 --> 01:42:11.397]  And some young people are awake, but they're either awake or they're totally in the Matrix.
[01:42:11.397 --> 01:42:13.177]  They've grown up under surveillance.
[01:42:13.177 --> 01:42:14.758]  They were born into slavery.
[01:42:14.758 --> 01:42:15.718]  They have no idea.
[01:42:16.685 --> 01:42:22.789]  And what we need to do is what you and I have done, which is homeschool our children and get them out of the system and teach them what is real.
[01:42:22.789 --> 01:42:23.630]  That's the answer.
[01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:27.252]  The globalists have broken away to build their technocracy from us.
[01:42:27.252 --> 01:42:35.817]  We've got to hold our resources back, sabotage the system every way we can, and pull out and teach our children this is an ailing and evil system.
[01:42:35.817 --> 01:42:37.098]  Anything else, ma'am?
[01:42:37.098 --> 01:42:37.478]  That's it.
[01:42:37.478 --> 01:42:43.182]  Just 30 years I've been homeschooling and I got the kids out there and they're awake as all can get out and everybody else would do it.
[01:42:43.889 --> 01:42:44.330]  That's it.
[01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:45.571]  Keep the internet free.
[01:42:45.571 --> 01:42:47.333]  Everybody be activists in media.
[01:42:47.333 --> 01:42:49.094]  Get your children out of the system.
[01:42:49.094 --> 01:42:52.678]  Teach them everything on television is meant to wreck their mind.
[01:42:52.678 --> 01:42:55.500]  And that the government has been captured by foreign offshore banks.
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:56.902]  Knowing that is half the battle.
[01:42:56.902 --> 01:42:57.763]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:43:00.771 --> 01:43:06.232]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:43:06.232 --> 01:43:15.134]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:43:15.134 --> 01:43:22.955]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.

[01:44:05.529 --> 01:44:12.912]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:44:12.912 --> 01:44:16.253]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:44:16.253 --> 01:44:18.014]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:44:18.294 --> 01:44:18.714]  We're good.
[01:44:40.776 --> 01:44:43.957]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[01:45:05.363 --> 01:45:09.904]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:45:09.904 --> 01:45:16.026]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:45:16.026 --> 01:45:26.809]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:45:27.009 --> 01:45:29.871]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!

[01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:50.443]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:45:50.883 --> 01:46:01.127]  I had tried everything.
[01:46:01.127 --> 01:46:03.488]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:46:03.488 --> 01:46:06.609]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:46:06.609 --> 01:46:11.431]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:17.794]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:46:18.294 --> 01:46:29.522]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[01:47:01.102 --> 01:47:02.623]  Coast to Coast.
[01:47:02.623 --> 01:47:04.684]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:04.684 --> 01:47:07.886]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:15.441 --> 01:47:21.492]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:47:21.492 --> 01:47:24.016]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:25.936 --> 01:47:31.418]  I mean, they're on television saying you didn't build your business, your kids don't belong to you.
[01:47:31.418 --> 01:47:36.621]  They're passing laws to let your kids have abortions without parental consent and take vaccines.
[01:47:36.621 --> 01:47:41.243]  And the same laws are being passed in Australia and England and Canada and the U.S.
[01:47:41.243 --> 01:47:42.243]  and Germany.
[01:47:42.243 --> 01:47:43.024]  It's global.
[01:47:43.024 --> 01:47:44.524]  It's big corporations.
[01:47:44.524 --> 01:47:47.025]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, go look it up.
[01:47:47.025 --> 01:47:51.848]  They finance Agenda 21, Common Core curriculum, 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:47:51.848 --> 01:47:54.469]  Your kid won't know tyranny if they don't know what 2 plus 2 equals.
[01:47:55.731 --> 01:47:57.713]  They financed disarming you.
[01:47:57.713 --> 01:47:59.856]  Of course foreign banks want you disarmed.
[01:47:59.856 --> 01:48:03.259]  Can you imagine the Greeks having all their property taken right now?
[01:48:03.259 --> 01:48:05.081]  If they had guns?
[01:48:05.081 --> 01:48:06.363]  It's real simple.
[01:48:06.363 --> 01:48:08.966]  All those rich bankers got private jets and armed bodyguards.
[01:48:10.333 --> 01:48:16.356]  And live in armored fortresses, but they say you can't have bodyguards, your own bodyguard.
[01:48:16.356 --> 01:48:20.838]  I'm gonna take, I got like 15 calls here, but I'm gonna go as fast as I can, Paul, Chris, and others.
[01:48:20.838 --> 01:48:22.939]  Paul, solutions to this tyranny.
[01:48:22.939 --> 01:48:24.579]  The last lady really said it.
[01:48:24.579 --> 01:48:26.020]  Get out of the system.
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:29.842]  I never used to say, you know, civil disobedience, noncompliance.
[01:48:29.842 --> 01:48:31.262]  The system's all a fraud.
[01:48:31.262 --> 01:48:33.303]  The foreign banks don't pay taxes.
[01:48:33.303 --> 01:48:35.264]  At this point, do whatever you gotta do, folks.
[01:48:35.264 --> 01:48:36.845]  The system's against you.
[01:48:36.845 --> 01:48:38.726]  Paul in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:48:39.406 --> 01:48:40.927]  Hi, thank you.
[01:48:40.927 --> 01:48:43.988]  I wanted to come up with a solution first.
[01:48:43.988 --> 01:48:55.912]  I've been working with local governments, state governments, village cities, and I've been experiencing, that's been the only solution I've seen up to this point, and getting out of the system, between the vaccines.
[01:48:55.912 --> 01:49:02.975]  That's it, the globalists come in and take over the local government, that's where the real power is, just to non-comply and sabotage.
[01:49:02.975 --> 01:49:06.296]  And by sabotage, I went to, you know, for a week up in
[01:49:07.728 --> 01:49:21.637]  Hot Springs, Arkansas, earlier this year with my family on a working vacation, they were having a water treatment statewide convention there, and I probably had two dozen or more head water people come over who were listeners and said, listen, they passed a law saying we gotta put fluoride in.
[01:49:21.637 --> 01:49:24.218]  When our cities voted it out, we just dump it.
[01:49:24.218 --> 01:49:25.359]  We don't put it in now.
[01:49:25.359 --> 01:49:27.040]  They were all, that's what you do.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.821]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:49:28.821 --> 01:49:32.543]  This story's pretty big that I have for you, so you probably need to get my number and call me off there.
[01:49:32.543 --> 01:49:33.144]  Go ahead.
[01:49:33.968 --> 01:49:37.231]  The city I live in does put fluoride in the water.
[01:49:37.231 --> 01:49:40.073]  They know all about the toxins and the things that it does.
[01:49:40.073 --> 01:49:41.234]  That's just a whole other thing.
[01:49:41.234 --> 01:49:42.094]  I addressed that with them.
[01:49:42.094 --> 01:49:44.016]  They said, well, it'd be too much work to stop.
[01:49:44.016 --> 01:49:45.177]  They admitted it was dangerous.
[01:49:45.177 --> 01:49:46.858]  They said it'd be too much work to stop.
[01:49:46.858 --> 01:49:50.521]  But Agenda 21 has totally taken over my city, the city of East Liverpool.
[01:49:50.521 --> 01:49:54.304]  They hired a Utah-based firm, Better City LLC.
[01:49:54.304 --> 01:49:54.804]  Check them out.
[01:49:54.804 --> 01:49:57.186]  I don't know about them, but they're horrible.
[01:49:57.186 --> 01:49:59.608]  They paid them like $2.5 million to come in.
[01:49:59.608 --> 01:50:00.469]  They're now making it
[01:50:01.053 --> 01:50:02.234]  Illegal for landlords.
[01:50:02.234 --> 01:50:09.597]  Well, the punishment is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by a $1,000 fine or six months in jail.
[01:50:09.597 --> 01:50:10.257]  Up to that.
[01:50:10.257 --> 01:50:18.061]  They're using zoning laws to roll out like the family courts a hundred years ago for eugenics, a total takeover of society.
[01:50:18.061 --> 01:50:24.924]  Right, well what they're doing is they're now requiring landlords, I mean they've been requiring landlords to buy licenses, but now the stipulation is
[01:50:26.815 --> 01:50:33.157]  That you register every detail to be allowed to have a license to rent out any property.
[01:50:33.157 --> 01:50:39.558]  No, no, what guns you personally have, what they're going to do, it's all globally standardized, sir.
[01:50:39.558 --> 01:50:47.820]  Every piece of information about not just the person on the lease, every single piece of information about every single person in the home.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:51.681]  And you have to do a full criminal background check, checking for every
[01:50:52.316 --> 01:50:57.819]  But understand, understand if it's illegal aliens though, then they're all above the law and you have to leave them alone.
[01:50:57.819 --> 01:51:08.244]  I've talked to high-level national managers of some of the biggest, I mean I did this years ago but now it's in the news, of national chains of apartment complexes.
[01:51:08.244 --> 01:51:11.046]  They tell them, let the illegals have ten to apartment.
[01:51:11.046 --> 01:51:15.588]  If a citizen has one extra person visiting for more than two days, kick them out.
[01:51:15.588 --> 01:51:17.049]  We got to make way for the illegals.
[01:51:17.912 --> 01:51:19.493]  Right, so it's illegal.
[01:51:19.493 --> 01:51:24.497]  If these people, if they can't pass the background check and the credit check, and you've got to give all that information to the city.
[01:51:24.497 --> 01:51:25.198]  No, no, no, no.
[01:51:25.198 --> 01:51:33.524]  What you do is you go in, you point it out in city council, you show where they're leaving illegal aliens alone, and it's the selective enforcement is how you'll bring them down.
[01:51:33.524 --> 01:51:36.827]  Send me info, sir, in an email, showtipsatinfowars.com.
[01:51:36.827 --> 01:51:37.988]  I'm fully aware of it.
[01:51:37.988 --> 01:51:41.811]  It's global standardized zoning to shut America down.
[01:51:41.811 --> 01:51:45.253]  And the insiders can run crack houses full of whoever they want.
[01:51:45.253 --> 01:51:46.855]  You will be shut down no matter what you do.
[01:51:47.355 --> 01:51:49.555]  It's mafia government, sir.
[01:51:49.555 --> 01:51:51.496]  Chris in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:51:51.496 --> 01:51:54.456]  Hey Alex, thanks.
[01:51:54.456 --> 01:51:55.917]  Two quick examples.
[01:51:55.917 --> 01:52:00.398]  We need to be willing to make real sacrifices and they need to be visible.
[01:52:00.398 --> 01:52:06.459]  I work as a contract project manager who's working for a healthcare company and we're installing software into a hospital.
[01:52:06.459 --> 01:52:10.760]  They told me I couldn't go into the hospital unless I agreed to take the flu vaccine.
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:11.660]  I flatly refused.
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:17.423]  Had a chance to lose my job there, they finally backed down because I refused to take their flu vaccine.
[01:52:17.423 --> 01:52:24.486]  And everybody's gotta say no together, because now they're gonna make it hundreds of vaccines they're gonna make you take, which on record, hurts you.
[01:52:24.486 --> 01:52:25.787]  Go ahead.
[01:52:25.787 --> 01:52:29.869]  So they're trying to link that to your job, which is illegal.
[01:52:29.869 --> 01:52:31.090]  That's right.
[01:52:31.090 --> 01:52:38.214]  Second example, I dared to bring up to a co-worker that I would rather drive than fly on a business trip.
[01:52:38.214 --> 01:52:40.335]  Instead of, because of dealing with the TSA.
[01:52:41.167 --> 01:52:45.649]  Instead of listening to me on that, they tattled on me to my boss, and I got fired.
[01:52:45.649 --> 01:52:48.730]  Secret police, I guess they work as other contractors in my industry.
[01:53:02.492 --> 01:53:03.032]  Yes, I did.
[01:53:03.032 --> 01:53:04.213]  I lost that contract.
[01:53:04.213 --> 01:53:08.777]  So, it wasn't a full-time employment job, so they could fire me a little bit more, you know.
[01:53:08.777 --> 01:53:11.179]  Well, aren't they good little Soviet snitches?
[01:53:11.179 --> 01:53:13.541]  They'll be living in North Korea soon enough.
[01:53:13.541 --> 01:53:14.741]  Man, these people are scum.
[01:53:14.741 --> 01:53:15.982]  Go ahead.
[01:53:15.982 --> 01:53:18.745]  And so, the answer is decentralization.
[01:53:18.745 --> 01:53:21.787]  Your last call, I mentioned about working within local politics.
[01:53:21.787 --> 01:53:22.608]  I've heard that before.
[01:53:22.608 --> 01:53:24.189]  All politics is local.
[01:53:24.189 --> 01:53:25.950]  That is where we have to really take the fight to them.
[01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:29.233]  The other thing is to make it a visible protest.
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:33.883]  You know, against one of the largest apparatuses out there, and that's the TSA.
[01:53:33.883 --> 01:53:38.506]  Well, exactly, I agree, because they're the tip of the spear in the takeover of the federal police.
[01:53:38.506 --> 01:53:48.532]  You're telling me that these contractors tattled on you when the TSA is almost as unpopular as Congress, with less than 10% approval rating?
[01:53:48.532 --> 01:53:56.898]  So the people you worked with were so anti-Liberty, what kind of contractor would fire you because you complained about the TSA?
[01:53:58.919 --> 01:54:01.260]  People that love their jobs more than liberty.
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:02.200]  And that's what we have to do.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:06.661]  But see, they think the instinct is to grovel to tyranny and they'll get ahead.
[01:54:06.661 --> 01:54:08.082]  They're going to bring everything down.
[01:54:08.082 --> 01:54:09.862]  Oh, these people have no idea.
[01:54:09.862 --> 01:54:10.542]  They have no idea.
[01:54:10.542 --> 01:54:12.243]  Go ahead.
[01:54:12.243 --> 01:54:18.525]  So the answer is to make it a visible display of not flying.
[01:54:18.525 --> 01:54:20.906]  Business people have got to stop flying.
[01:54:20.906 --> 01:54:22.786]  That is what's going to bring down the DSA.
[01:54:22.786 --> 01:54:25.847]  And people have to be willing to lose their jobs to do it.
[01:54:26.578 --> 01:54:27.861]  The pilots did it.
[01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:29.425]  I don't know why other business people can't.
[01:54:29.425 --> 01:54:33.735]  Listen, I walked in a CVS today to buy a toothbrush for here at the office.
[01:54:34.798 --> 01:54:37.200]  And the guy behind the counter goes, my mom's a listener, blah, blah, blah.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.601]  And I was like, okay, great.
[01:54:38.601 --> 01:54:40.543]  And he goes, by the way, don't film in here.
[01:54:40.543 --> 01:54:42.565]  My boss said, if you ever come in here, don't film.
[01:54:42.565 --> 01:54:44.847]  And I hadn't filmed in that CVS before.
[01:54:44.847 --> 01:54:47.449]  And I was like, with all these flu shot signs.
[01:54:47.449 --> 01:54:52.454]  So I'm going to go back there now, because my iPhone was in the car, just because they said that.
[01:54:52.454 --> 01:54:55.236]  And I'm going to call the manager out and everything.
[01:54:55.236 --> 01:54:56.317]  And go, what, you're going to film me?
[01:54:56.317 --> 01:54:58.999]  You got, you know, get a 20% discount if I take the flu shot?
[01:54:58.999 --> 01:55:01.922]  Here's your own insert saying, give me Guillain-Barré or kill me.
[01:55:02.242 --> 01:55:08.407]  I think I'm going to stand out front, not on your property, but the sidewalk, bullhorning that you can die from this shot.
[01:55:08.407 --> 01:55:11.970]  And the guy goes, well listen, we just don't like it that you're anti-CVS.
[01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:14.032]  I go, it's not about CVS, dummy.
[01:55:14.032 --> 01:55:16.394]  I'm in here buying a stupid toothbrush.
[01:55:16.394 --> 01:55:24.140]  It's about every store I go in, they're pushing a shot that doesn't protect you from the flu and triples your chances of Alzheimer's in major studies.
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:24.820]  God bless you, sir.
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:25.521]  You're absolutely right.
[01:55:25.521 --> 01:55:27.322]  It's time to get aggressive.
[01:55:27.322 --> 01:55:28.664]  Yeah, there, Newark Daily News.
[01:55:29.324 --> 01:55:30.544]  Man took a shot.
[01:55:30.544 --> 01:55:31.385]  Brain swole up.
[01:55:31.385 --> 01:55:33.685]  He died from the flu shot.
[01:55:33.685 --> 01:55:35.906]  Gardasil shots don't protect you from papilloma.
[01:55:35.906 --> 01:55:37.426]  They kill you in many cases.
[01:55:37.426 --> 01:55:38.386]  But so what?
[01:55:38.386 --> 01:55:39.467]  It's all fun.
[01:55:39.467 --> 01:55:40.387]  I'm going into overdrive.
[01:55:40.387 --> 01:55:41.687]  I have to do it, guys.
[01:55:41.687 --> 01:55:49.609]  I have to go to all the calls because we've got John and Eric and Alan and BB and Lola and Chris and Tony and Ben.
[01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:51.050]  But I'm going to just boom, boom, boom.
[01:55:51.670 --> 01:56:10.627]  When we come back, most stations don't carry the third hour, because the third hour doesn't exist except in cyberspace, at InfoWars.com, with the audio feeds, InfoWars.com forward slash show, to find the free video and audio feeds, to see the high quality archives, all my films, the nightly news and more, PrisonPlanet.tv, and we're going to start running a special this week.
[01:56:11.087 --> 01:56:16.552]  You need to get that yearly special going, where people get three months free when they sign up for a year.
[01:56:16.552 --> 01:56:17.754]  But you can sign up monthly right now.
[01:56:17.754 --> 01:56:18.995]  It's $5.95.
[01:56:18.995 --> 01:56:24.120]  And each monthly subscription is really 11 people can use the same username passcode.
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:26.002]  Create an original username passcode.
[01:56:26.542 --> 01:56:28.124]  Go get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:56:28.124 --> 01:56:38.415]  You can see all my films in high def, other films, the live nightly news, the live events, the archives, the commercial-free podcasts of the show, and it supports the transmission.
[01:56:38.415 --> 01:56:40.557]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:40.557 --> 01:56:41.979]  Give, give subscriptions today.
[01:56:41.979 --> 01:56:46.244]  Go give yourself a subscription, and then 11 people you can share the username and passcode with.
[01:56:47.301 --> 01:56:52.845]  Friends and family with that username and passcode that's separate from your credit card info so it's safe.
[01:56:52.845 --> 01:56:54.065]  We've set it up that way.
[01:56:54.065 --> 01:57:04.252]  You can share your username and passcode with up to 11 members of your family who can then simultaneously log in and see it all and it supports the transmission.
[01:57:04.252 --> 01:57:11.676]  But for everybody else, free audio video feeds of the radio show slash TV show at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:57:11.676 --> 01:57:14.418]  Other stations, other great shows and the news are coming up for you.
[01:57:15.959 --> 01:57:18.581]  Because I can say the great shows are on talk radio now.
[01:57:18.581 --> 01:57:30.672]  We've really led the way with true constitutional libertarian futurist research to where now all the big shows are covering these issues instead of attacking me because it all came true.
[01:57:30.672 --> 01:57:32.413]  Anyways, great job to the crew.
[01:57:32.413 --> 01:57:35.716]  This is it for the main radio broadcast, but internet only.
[01:57:35.716 --> 01:57:38.198]  Coming up for 10-15 minutes to finish up with your calls.
[01:57:38.198 --> 01:57:39.779]  I promise to get to your calls.
[01:57:39.779 --> 01:57:41.301]  So we will do this in overdrive.
[01:57:41.862 --> 01:57:45.935]  At Infowars.com forward slash show right now.
[01:57:45.935 --> 01:57:47.379]  Wake up to the tyranny, folks.
[01:57:47.379 --> 01:57:48.162]  Wake up to the fact.
[01:57:50.666 --> 01:57:57.290]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:59.772]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:57:59.772 --> 01:58:00.132]  The U.S.
[01:58:00.132 --> 01:58:04.375]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:58:04.375 --> 01:58:07.337]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:58:07.337 --> 01:58:08.818]  They want that attack to come.
[01:58:08.818 --> 01:58:15.002]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:58:15.407 --> 01:58:18.070]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:23.035]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:58:23.035 --> 01:58:30.463]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:58:30.783 --> 01:58:33.545]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:58:33.545 --> 01:58:36.626]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:58:36.626 --> 01:58:41.209]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[01:58:49.701 --> 01:59:00.384]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:59:00.384 --> 01:59:02.464]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:59:02.464 --> 01:59:03.325]  Fluoride!
[01:59:03.325 --> 01:59:05.265]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:59:05.265 --> 01:59:11.567]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:59:11.827 --> 01:59:16.748]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:59:16.748 --> 01:59:23.070]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:59:23.070 --> 01:59:25.490]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:59:25.490 --> 01:59:28.431]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:59:28.431 --> 01:59:31.772]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:59:31.932 --> 01:59:37.353]  You'll find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:37.353 --> 01:59:42.454]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:59:42.454 --> 01:59:43.655]  I take it every day.
[01:59:43.655 --> 01:59:51.216]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:59:51.216 --> 01:59:54.797]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:59:54.797 --> 01:59:57.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:00:09.777 --> 02:00:11.359]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.359 --> 02:00:12.661]  Well, so does he!
[02:00:12.661 --> 02:00:17.387]  Live, from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:27.751 --> 02:00:29.592]  I appreciate everybody who is online.
[02:00:29.592 --> 02:00:31.353]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:00:31.353 --> 02:00:46.642]  Right now, we're in overdrive on this December 1st, 2013 transmission as we desperately try to shake the sleeping giant that is humanity awake to the peril and bring down the globalist dehumanization power structure.
[02:00:46.642 --> 02:00:50.464]  Right now, let's go to John in Texas.
[02:00:50.464 --> 02:00:52.245]  Thank you for holding, sir.
[02:00:52.245 --> 02:00:54.086]  Yeah, Alex Jones, please.
[02:00:54.086 --> 02:00:54.967]  Alex Jones?
[02:00:55.902 --> 02:00:59.385]  Hey, I remember there used to be a... Alex Jones?
[02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:02.947]  There used to be a prank caller on my radio show would do that.
[02:01:02.947 --> 02:01:06.230]  No, a fan.
[02:01:06.230 --> 02:01:08.432]  That would be me.
[02:01:08.432 --> 02:01:10.673]  Didn't you used to be in Austin?
[02:01:10.673 --> 02:01:13.335]  Somebody used to call into AXS TV and say that.
[02:01:13.335 --> 02:01:14.937]  I'm still here.
[02:01:14.937 --> 02:01:16.378]  Oh, so you're not calling from Ohio.
[02:01:19.429 --> 02:01:22.330]  Okay, well they put the wrong thing on there, it doesn't matter.
[02:01:22.330 --> 02:01:24.131]  Anyways, let's just say you're in Ohio now.
[02:01:24.131 --> 02:01:35.416]  I am in Ohio, and I just have to open your eyes and get away from the stuff, because it's all over.
[02:01:35.416 --> 02:01:45.520]  You had a big effect calling every AXS television show going, Alex Jones please, Alex Jones, and then they always thought it was me doing it.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:45.900]  Yes.
[02:01:47.034 --> 02:01:49.098]  And look where we're at now.
[02:01:49.098 --> 02:01:50.420]  Look where I'm at now.
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:56.130]  I'm still avoiding all that crap out there.
[02:01:56.130 --> 02:01:57.773]  It's everywhere.
[02:01:57.773 --> 02:01:58.514]  Man, I tell ya.
[02:02:00.590 --> 02:02:01.151]  Oh, I know.
[02:02:01.151 --> 02:02:05.556]  I mean, I wish my show hadn't become passe by everything coming true.
[02:02:05.556 --> 02:02:08.760]  I mean, the globalists have done what they said they'd do.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:14.266]  They're about a decade behind, but they're behind, but they're following the course.
[02:02:14.266 --> 02:02:17.410]  And let me tell you, we hope this train don't come in.
[02:02:17.410 --> 02:02:20.314]  We hope that this isn't a delivery that makes it.
[02:02:21.391 --> 02:02:24.212]  We need to return the New World Order to the sender.
[02:02:24.212 --> 02:02:25.732]  You know that Elvis song?
[02:02:25.732 --> 02:02:32.255]  Return to sender, no such number, no such... Can we go out with that in about 15 minutes?
[02:02:32.255 --> 02:02:33.655]  I bet you can find it on YouTube.
[02:02:33.655 --> 02:02:35.316]  Elvis, return to sender.
[02:02:35.316 --> 02:02:36.896]  Go ahead, I'm sorry, sir.
[02:02:36.896 --> 02:02:41.058]  Yeah, I was even at your DPS protest.
[02:02:41.058 --> 02:02:42.058]  DPS protest?
[02:02:42.058 --> 02:02:43.759]  Yeah, yes, yes, yes.
[02:02:43.759 --> 02:02:47.500]  Oh my God, man, I didn't know I'd actually met Alex Jones, please.
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:50.561]  For folks who don't know, can you just say Alex Jones, please, a whole bunch?
[02:02:51.542 --> 02:02:53.124]  Alex Jones, please.
[02:02:53.124 --> 02:02:54.667]  Alex Jones.
[02:02:54.667 --> 02:02:56.249]  Alex Jones.
[02:02:56.249 --> 02:02:57.892]  Alex Jones.
[02:02:57.892 --> 02:03:00.075]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:00.075 --> 02:03:02.598]  Alex Jones, please.
[02:03:02.598 --> 02:03:03.480]  Alex Jones, please.
[02:03:04.574 --> 02:03:19.937]  Imagine if people take that soundbite in a soundboard and begin prank calling everyone and putting it on YouTube or calling into talk radio shows, talking for a few minutes and then saying, I'm going to put someone on the line and then hitting that.
[02:03:19.937 --> 02:03:26.098]  It could become a whole new meme that would definitely upset some people.
[02:03:26.098 --> 02:03:26.478]  Sorry.
[02:03:26.478 --> 02:03:30.018]  Go ahead.
[02:03:30.018 --> 02:03:30.799]  Pardon me, sir.
[02:03:30.799 --> 02:03:31.099]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:31.099 --> 02:03:32.159]  You're on the air.
[02:03:32.159 --> 02:03:33.079]  I tried 17 years ago.
[02:03:34.468 --> 02:03:35.909]  Well, you've done a great job, brother.
[02:03:35.909 --> 02:03:39.733]  Anything else you'd like to add, Eric, from Austin, Texas?
[02:03:39.733 --> 02:03:45.739]  I would say... I would say, uh, wish you well.
[02:03:45.739 --> 02:03:47.541]  Well, I wish you well as well, sir.
[02:03:47.541 --> 02:03:48.522]  Thank you very much.
[02:03:48.522 --> 02:03:51.465]  That's an example of what perseverance can do.
[02:03:51.465 --> 02:03:53.187]  Let's talk to Alan Enmas.
[02:03:53.187 --> 02:03:53.887]  You're on the air.
[02:03:53.887 --> 02:03:54.208]  Welcome.
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:03.803]  Hey Alex, calling you from the great wasteland of John Hancock, Sam Adams, John Adams, and Robert Payne.
[02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:13.367]  Now captured by kleptocratic fascists using a socialist communist model to manage and domesticate the public.
[02:04:13.367 --> 02:04:17.448]  17 billion in debt, brother, and growing every month.
[02:04:17.448 --> 02:04:20.889]  Just an abuse in a solution.
[02:04:20.889 --> 02:04:24.911]  The abuse, I live in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, which is next door to New Bedford.
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:30.766]  And our way of making a living down here is through fishing.
[02:04:30.766 --> 02:04:37.937]  And the Obama-NOAA has managed to bankrupt over half of the fleet.
[02:04:39.290 --> 02:04:43.912]  In Gloucester, which is one of the great fishing ports of the Northeast.
[02:04:43.912 --> 02:04:48.374]  But globalist foreign trawlers are allowed to fish all they want.
[02:04:48.374 --> 02:04:51.235]  Same thing in Mexico, same thing on the West Coast.
[02:04:51.235 --> 02:04:58.738]  NOAA, the National Oceanic Weather Administration, in fact, MZ, two of our affiliates out in
[02:04:59.983 --> 02:05:04.367]  The central coast area just south of San Francisco.
[02:05:04.367 --> 02:05:05.768]  It's on the news there.
[02:05:05.768 --> 02:05:11.853]  The NOAA people arrest surfers that come visiting if they get near a whale.
[02:05:11.853 --> 02:05:14.235]  If a whale just comes up by you, you're arrested.
[02:05:14.235 --> 02:05:15.076]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:05:15.076 --> 02:05:18.519]  Tell folks about the reign of terror against small fishermen.
[02:05:18.519 --> 02:05:25.825]  Well, in Gloucester, like I said, one of the great fishing ports of the Northeast, there are 30 boats that still fish.
[02:05:25.825 --> 02:05:27.346]  Out of a great fishing port.
[02:05:28.118 --> 02:05:33.459]  And out of the hundreds of boats that used to fish in New Bedford, over half are bankrupt.
[02:05:33.459 --> 02:05:44.822]  For instance, we did an expose the other day on Noah, and he said because of global warming, there are no more cod off the coast of New England.
[02:05:44.822 --> 02:05:55.405]  So one of the fishermen went out, he had a 5,000 pound catch limit for cod, and it took him five hours to get his catch limit for the year of cod.
[02:05:55.973 --> 02:05:57.234]  No, I know.
[02:05:57.234 --> 02:06:00.075]  They lie about everything.
[02:06:00.075 --> 02:06:04.198]  They say when a dust storm hits Mongolia that it's global warming.
[02:06:04.198 --> 02:06:12.302]  And again, it's all about them selectively... Listen, I've been down to Cozumel probably 20 times with my wife or more.
[02:06:12.302 --> 02:06:16.445]  I can't go back now because all the fishermen are not allowed to fish anymore.
[02:06:16.445 --> 02:06:21.408]  They can't take you out fishing and you see these big international trawlers fishing out there.
[02:06:21.408 --> 02:06:23.309]  And because the government got bought off
[02:06:24.574 --> 02:06:30.937]  And the people can go move to Mexico City for slave labor, just like we can go move and I guess work for Walmart as well.
[02:06:30.937 --> 02:06:32.357]  I mean, this is a total plan.
[02:06:32.357 --> 02:06:32.737]  Go ahead.
[02:06:32.737 --> 02:06:34.758]  Uh, solution.
[02:06:34.758 --> 02:06:36.739]  Is there any type of pamphlet?
[02:06:36.739 --> 02:06:43.902]  Because I'll tell you, I want to shake my brother in that time, but I feel like I'm in Kmart yelling at mannequins.
[02:06:43.902 --> 02:06:48.264]  Is there any type of pamphlet, three or four pages maybe?
[02:06:48.264 --> 02:06:51.265]  Is Obama bankrupting America?
[02:06:52.239 --> 02:06:53.460]  I don't know.
[02:07:08.848 --> 02:07:34.526]  He's explaining the New World Order, how it's a mafia, how they work, how they're authoritarian, how they shut down economies, why they want your guns, short little pamphlet like a Chick-fil-A, why they want your kids, why they want to shut down your factory, what their plan is, and then show they own the factory in China, so when they shut you down, now you've got to buy it from them, then you have no job, now they can buy you up cheap.
[02:07:34.526 --> 02:07:35.947]  I mean, see, you're absolutely right.
[02:07:35.947 --> 02:07:37.408]  This is all stuff needs to be done.
[02:07:38.271 --> 02:07:41.913]  Simplicity though, my brother.
[02:07:41.913 --> 02:07:42.513]  I agree.
[02:07:42.513 --> 02:07:55.021]  Maybe I should have a $10,000 contest where people come up with online comics or online graphic novels and then the ones we pick, you know, we pay and then we put it out and put it out at cost.
[02:07:55.021 --> 02:07:55.561]  I agree.
[02:07:55.561 --> 02:07:56.482]  It's something I want to do.
[02:07:56.482 --> 02:08:00.164]  I just, I want to do it all.
[02:08:00.164 --> 02:08:02.305]  I'm trying as best I can, but that's another great idea.
[02:08:02.305 --> 02:08:07.348]  I mean, I tell you, our listeners are a fountainhead of good ideas and I've had the exact same ideas, brother.
[02:08:08.001 --> 02:08:09.382]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:08:09.382 --> 02:08:10.703]  Let me ask you a quick question.
[02:08:10.703 --> 02:08:24.053]  What are people saying about the fact that they don't let the small fishermen fish or even the sports fishermen go out now, they harass everybody, but then don't touch the big international trawlers?
[02:08:24.053 --> 02:08:32.339]  The Democrat Party is so ingrained in the culture that, like Savage once said, it's a mental disorder.
[02:08:32.339 --> 02:08:34.461]  And it really is a mental disorder.
[02:08:34.461 --> 02:08:35.582]  They're not getting it.
[02:08:36.334 --> 02:08:55.701]  And the biggest problem we have too in Massachusetts is we have such great athletic teams that they're so easily distracted with the Patriots and the Red Sox and the Bruins that they get so easily dissuaded from the bulwarks crashing down right around them.
[02:08:56.943 --> 02:09:10.724]  Just like as Visigoth armies were marching five miles outside Rome and had defeated the Roman legions, there were still in 410 games going on and sporting events as
[02:09:11.963 --> 02:09:17.206]  Literally in days, everyone was being raped and killed and they didn't care.
[02:09:17.206 --> 02:09:26.151]  Smart folks were pulling out and racing to the west to the seaports and to Corsica and other areas to get out of Italy.
[02:09:26.151 --> 02:09:34.936]  What's Italy today, but the trendies, they just kept partying and kept having sex and kept gulping down goblets of wine until it all collapsed.
[02:09:34.936 --> 02:09:37.277]  And mathematically, that's where this is all headed.
[02:09:38.356 --> 02:09:40.618]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:09:40.618 --> 02:09:51.225]  Yeah, it really is a mental disorder, because look, I know the Republicans are corrupt and bad, and they go along with the same agenda because they're bought and paid for, but at least they have to act like they're pro-family, pro-gun and stuff.
[02:09:51.225 --> 02:09:54.487]  And Republicans go to sleep whenever they're in office, so it's almost as bad.
[02:09:54.487 --> 02:09:59.110]  But with Democrats, they don't care if they get triple-charged for Obamacare.
[02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:01.092]  They don't care if they get cheated.
[02:10:01.092 --> 02:10:04.894]  They don't care if black unemployment doubles under Obama, from 7.5% to 14, almost 15%.
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:09.121]  They don't care.
[02:10:09.121 --> 02:10:11.163]  It's like my team is winning.
[02:10:11.163 --> 02:10:13.566]  It's like Obama's their team.
[02:10:13.566 --> 02:10:21.575]  And it doesn't matter if MSNBC sounds like a Ku Klux Klan channel, you know, just creating what I guess reverse racism would be the word.
[02:10:21.575 --> 02:10:22.516]  It just doesn't matter.
[02:10:22.516 --> 02:10:26.040]  It's like we're on the winning team and that's what losers want to believe.
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:29.183]  They want to just think they're winners when they're losers.
[02:10:30.285 --> 02:10:34.969]  And it's the imagination and the delusion over the reality.
[02:10:34.969 --> 02:10:37.171]  All I want is for them to have prosperity.
[02:10:37.171 --> 02:10:40.333]  All I want is for us to come together around a Bill of Rights culture.
[02:10:40.333 --> 02:10:42.115]  All I want is to go to the stars.
[02:10:42.115 --> 02:10:49.261]  All I want is to have life extension further advanced and deployed to the people.
[02:10:49.261 --> 02:10:52.383]  All I want is for my children to have a future.
[02:10:52.383 --> 02:10:54.925]  I realize how short life is, and I have a love affair.
[02:10:55.726 --> 02:11:02.850]  With animals and thinking about all their generations and thinking about, you know, the whales and all their generations.
[02:11:02.850 --> 02:11:05.951]  And then I love humans so much even more.
[02:11:05.951 --> 02:11:09.353]  And I just want humans to have a future.
[02:11:09.353 --> 02:11:13.315]  And I want people to look back on my work and use it as an example of something good.
[02:11:13.315 --> 02:11:15.937]  And I just admire people's art.
[02:11:15.937 --> 02:11:19.098]  I admire people's creations, their inventions.
[02:11:19.098 --> 02:11:23.301]  And I realize that a lot of people don't admire other people that are successful or smart.
[02:11:23.301 --> 02:11:23.921]  They hate you.
[02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:28.052]  And it's just a very ugly, sick culture.
[02:11:28.052 --> 02:11:34.657]  And I'm not on some high horse, as I call it here, but at least I know good from evil.
[02:11:36.823 --> 02:11:38.905]  That's the final equation.
[02:11:38.905 --> 02:11:45.551]  The answer to the final equation is the elite are inbred and inbred psychopaths and sociopaths.
[02:11:45.551 --> 02:11:46.652]  They hate themselves.
[02:11:46.652 --> 02:11:49.695]  They project it onto everyone else.
[02:11:49.695 --> 02:11:52.497]  The public has had it so good for so long.
[02:11:52.497 --> 02:11:54.379]  Prosperity makes monsters.
[02:11:54.379 --> 02:11:56.321]  Adversity makes men.
[02:11:56.321 --> 02:11:58.422]  Victor Hugo actually flipped it.
[02:11:58.422 --> 02:12:01.986]  He said adversity makes men.
[02:12:01.986 --> 02:12:03.187]  Prosperity makes monsters.
[02:12:04.485 --> 02:12:06.786]  The French statesman and philosopher.
[02:12:06.786 --> 02:12:07.606]  And it's really true.
[02:12:07.606 --> 02:12:12.428]  I mean, I'm a monster compared to me and my great-great-grandpa and people like that.
[02:12:12.428 --> 02:12:20.532]  I mean, who worked literally 18 hours a day and were meaner than a bucket of rattlesnakes and, you know, were tougher than nails and everything else.
[02:12:20.532 --> 02:12:23.373]  And I'm not just projecting and romanticizing people back then.
[02:12:23.373 --> 02:12:25.414]  It's so wonderful.
[02:12:25.414 --> 02:12:32.277]  It's just that I can look at old photographs of my ancestors and they look meaner and tougher than, you know, somebody like
[02:12:34.955 --> 02:12:37.160]  Clint Eastwood.
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:40.947]  The Clint Eastwood all skinny, rugged, those eyes awake, electricity in them.
[02:12:40.947 --> 02:12:44.193]  I look at my ancestors, they all look like Clint Eastwood.
[02:12:44.193 --> 02:12:46.798]  I don't look like Clint Eastwood, I look like a big soft wimp.
[02:12:48.052 --> 02:12:52.917]  And, I mean, I had, like, ancestors who had, like, four wives, because they'd wear each one out.
[02:12:52.917 --> 02:12:59.804]  You know, having, like, 35 kids, and, you know, gun battles, and just constantly killing people that messed with them.
[02:12:59.804 --> 02:13:04.950]  And, I mean, compared to that, I mean, my ancestors, if somebody messed with them, would start killing people.
[02:13:06.370 --> 02:13:10.252]  And I look at people like that compared to what we are today.
[02:13:10.252 --> 02:13:11.812]  We're a joke!
[02:13:11.812 --> 02:13:18.015]  They've had geneticists look at somebody in Sparta 3,000 years ago compared to the genetics now.
[02:13:18.015 --> 02:13:21.596]  We are wasted, folks, with all the lead, the mercury, the toxins.
[02:13:21.596 --> 02:13:22.996]  Our DNA is shredded.
[02:13:22.996 --> 02:13:24.897]  We're getting dumber.
[02:13:24.897 --> 02:13:27.458]  We're falling apart, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:27.458 --> 02:13:28.719]  And at least I can admit it.
[02:13:28.719 --> 02:13:34.881]  I mean, I look at photos on both sides of my family.
[02:13:35.723 --> 02:13:42.306]  Of ancestors going back 160, 170 years ago, and they all look like they were on fire with life, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:42.306 --> 02:13:46.147]  Their eyes went right through you.
[02:13:46.147 --> 02:13:48.128]  They all had trillion-mile stairs.
[02:13:48.128 --> 02:13:51.870]  You look at people now, we're wrecked by television and all of it.
[02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:58.793]  This is totally toxic, this environment, ladies and gentlemen, to the soul, not just chemically.
[02:13:58.793 --> 02:14:00.974]  Eric in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:14:02.384 --> 02:14:04.285]  Alex, it's great to get through.
[02:14:04.285 --> 02:14:07.007]  I've been listening to you for a few months.
[02:14:07.007 --> 02:14:11.030]  I can tell you your show has given me virtually a full-scale awakening.
[02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:14.573]  I don't want to dwell too much.
[02:14:14.573 --> 02:14:17.295]  I'm just complimenting you, but I did want to get that out.
[02:14:17.295 --> 02:14:31.905]  Anyhow, I heard an earlier caller alluding to how the young generation is a lost cause, so to speak, and for a long time I was sort of a cynic and thought that, you know, for various reasons,
[02:14:32.665 --> 02:14:46.395]  But it's kind of what you were just talking about, the culture of television, of hip-hop, you know, these sick misogynists who just bathe in meaningless currency and glorify it.
[02:14:46.395 --> 02:14:51.279]  We need to have a new figure in media, be it in music, be it in a movie.
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:59.264]  Um, who is just the antithesis of that, you know, a rugged individualist, as your ancestors, you were just describing.
[02:14:59.264 --> 02:15:02.445]  All our ancestors, I mean, came here through adversity.
[02:15:02.445 --> 02:15:03.406]  And you're right.
[02:15:03.406 --> 02:15:05.287]  That's why we've got to take over the culture.
[02:15:05.287 --> 02:15:08.889]  We've got to vote with our dollars for icons and images that are healthy.
[02:15:08.889 --> 02:15:14.251]  And even high-level Hollywood folks have told me they want to put out wholesome stuff, but the higher-ups tell them don't do it.
[02:15:14.251 --> 02:15:18.914]  But even the higher-ups are buckling because it's the wholesome messages that make the money now.
[02:15:20.487 --> 02:15:23.108]  And so there's a real battle even in Hollywood.
[02:15:23.108 --> 02:15:31.612]  Listen, when you get down to the final wire with this evil, even people that have been part of the system aren't going to want to go along with it.
[02:15:31.612 --> 02:15:34.454]  This is not going to be a cakewalk for the people that are running this.
[02:15:34.454 --> 02:15:34.734]  Go ahead.
[02:15:37.357 --> 02:15:38.797]  I totally agree.
[02:15:38.797 --> 02:15:41.138]  I live in a small conservative area.
[02:15:41.138 --> 02:15:48.700]  A lot of my friends are avid hunters, fishermen, trappers.
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:53.901]  It's that spirit, Alex, that is going to set us free from this tyranny.
[02:15:53.901 --> 02:15:57.462]  It's not about... What am I trying to say here?
[02:15:58.061 --> 02:16:02.123]  I don't think it's about any specific, you know, facet of this.
[02:16:02.123 --> 02:16:11.306]  I drive out in the country, I see sometimes the clouds are in literal gridlock of chemtrails, and now I hear you talking about fluoride in the water.
[02:16:11.306 --> 02:16:13.747]  But it's not about any individual facet, Alex.
[02:16:13.747 --> 02:16:20.269]  I think it's about an all-encompassing spirit of individuality that will set us free.
[02:16:20.269 --> 02:16:21.830]  Sorry, I'm not being very articulate.
[02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:22.390]  No, you are!
[02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:24.031]  You're awesome, BB, and thank you for the call.
[02:16:25.154 --> 02:16:26.035]  And that's the thing.
[02:16:26.035 --> 02:16:30.518]  When I was a kid, we'd be on our ranch hunting and had some hunters that were part of a lease.
[02:16:30.518 --> 02:16:33.621]  And you might, every couple years, have the game warden pull up.
[02:16:33.621 --> 02:16:34.642]  Hey, what's going on?
[02:16:34.642 --> 02:16:35.843]  Oh, nice deer.
[02:16:35.843 --> 02:16:38.825]  They would just see there were tags on their antlers and leave you alone.
[02:16:38.825 --> 02:16:39.545]  Now they show up.
[02:16:39.545 --> 02:16:41.127]  We're part of a federal task force.
[02:16:41.127 --> 02:16:45.110]  We're going in here without a warrant and run around and do it to the next farm, the next ranch.
[02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:48.633]  Bugging their eyes out with their hands on their guns like they're superheroes.
[02:16:49.318 --> 02:16:53.681]  And when they do that, you gotta buck up and go, hey man, quit treating me like I'm a criminal.
[02:16:53.681 --> 02:16:55.042]  Quit bugging your eyes out at me.
[02:16:55.042 --> 02:17:00.387]  Quit... Americans act like people in North Korea, folks.
[02:17:00.387 --> 02:17:04.970]  Everyone grovels to anybody in a uniform, and that's always the sign of tyranny.
[02:17:04.970 --> 02:17:15.018]  And so those trappers and hunters and people, when you see a bunch of game wardens, and I'm not saying they're all criminals, but they're trying to make them that way now, in a restaurant eating, you walk over and go, why do you guys act so arrogant and powerful now?
[02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:19.083]  They try to act all quiet and weird and go, why are you acting arrogant?
[02:17:19.083 --> 02:17:20.863]  Why are you acting like I'm a slave?
[02:17:20.863 --> 02:17:22.264]  Why don't you move to Mexico?
[02:17:22.264 --> 02:17:24.345]  And then they go, hey buddy, watch it.
[02:17:24.345 --> 02:17:25.646]  Go on, what are you, a tough guy?
[02:17:25.646 --> 02:17:26.907]  What, all four of you are big and tough?
[02:17:26.907 --> 02:17:28.307]  You don't like somebody talking to you?
[02:17:28.307 --> 02:17:31.049]  I mean, that's what, I mean, I do that now.
[02:17:31.049 --> 02:17:34.291]  When I see a bunch of guys on a power trip, that's what I do.
[02:17:34.291 --> 02:17:34.891]  I'm done.
[02:17:34.891 --> 02:17:35.451]  I'm done.
[02:17:35.451 --> 02:17:35.951]  I'm done.
[02:17:35.951 --> 02:17:36.432]  I'm done.
[02:17:36.432 --> 02:17:36.912]  I'm done.
[02:17:36.912 --> 02:17:37.692]  I'm done.
[02:17:37.692 --> 02:17:38.693]  I'm done rolling over.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:46.501]  I'm telling you folks, they're trying to train all the paramilitary police, game wardens, military, that we're an enemy.
[02:17:46.501 --> 02:17:51.662]  And when they act like that and we grovel, they think it's normal what they're doing.
[02:17:51.662 --> 02:17:54.523]  Just like if you run from a dog, folks, it'll run up and bite you.
[02:17:54.523 --> 02:17:57.584]  When these people start growling at you, you go, what are you growling at me for?
[02:17:57.584 --> 02:17:58.644]  You think I'm food?
[02:17:58.644 --> 02:17:59.844]  I'm not your food!
[02:17:59.844 --> 02:18:02.325]  Get that through your stinking narcotics trafficking head!
[02:18:02.325 --> 02:18:06.746]  Excuse me.
[02:18:06.746 --> 02:18:07.666]  Thought I'd just talk to BB.
[02:18:08.973 --> 02:18:09.753]  Okay, sorry, Eric.
[02:18:09.753 --> 02:18:10.494]  I'm out of control.
[02:18:10.494 --> 02:18:11.214]  Thank you, Eric.
[02:18:11.214 --> 02:18:15.256]  Oh, I guess the light flashes on the next person.
[02:18:15.256 --> 02:18:16.677]  I'm sorry, Eric, in Ohio.
[02:18:16.677 --> 02:18:17.597]  God bless you.
[02:18:17.597 --> 02:18:19.178]  BB in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:18:19.178 --> 02:18:21.279]  Hi, Alex.
[02:18:21.279 --> 02:18:26.642]  At least I had forewarning that I was coming on, not just a little... Oh, yeah.
[02:18:26.642 --> 02:18:26.862]  Oh, yeah.
[02:18:28.501 --> 02:18:29.562]  Globalism?
[02:18:29.562 --> 02:18:30.482]  No solution.
[02:18:30.482 --> 02:18:31.122]  It's here.
[02:18:31.122 --> 02:18:32.103]  It's how it is.
[02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:35.684]  It is all dependent upon how it gets implemented.
[02:18:35.684 --> 02:18:36.184]  That's right.
[02:18:36.184 --> 02:18:41.306]  Foreign, ruthless, eugenics-based banks wanting to wreck everything to control us.
[02:18:41.306 --> 02:18:48.829]  In control, running our lives with power-tripping paramilitaries, arming to the teeth, strutting around in literal goose steps.
[02:18:48.829 --> 02:18:50.049]  Go ahead.
[02:18:50.049 --> 02:18:56.572]  Well, I just think that the whole idea of globalism, whether it's done by foreign banksters or
[02:18:57.301 --> 02:19:10.187]  You know, Aparigines, whatever, that time and space has been shrunk here on planet Earth with the internet, with travel, with, you know, jet airplanes, so there's going to have to be some kind of globalism.
[02:19:10.187 --> 02:19:13.749]  It is all going to be dependent upon how it is implemented.
[02:19:13.749 --> 02:19:14.850]  A solution.
[02:19:14.850 --> 02:19:19.192]  Perhaps we should reexamine reenacting the Sherman Antitrust Act.
[02:19:19.927 --> 02:19:27.931]  This whole situation is reminding me of a Heinlein, a Robert Heinlein book called Friday, where the corporations are completely in control.
[02:19:27.931 --> 02:19:30.512]  Have you ever read Friday by Heinlein?
[02:19:30.512 --> 02:19:31.252]  Yes, I have.
[02:19:31.252 --> 02:19:32.793]  I've read almost all of his books.
[02:19:32.793 --> 02:19:40.356]  Time Enough for Love, Revolt 2024, I think that's the name of it, Starship Troopers, you name it.
[02:19:40.356 --> 02:19:42.477]  Well, I'm a Heinlein freak and I
[02:19:43.667 --> 02:19:55.591]  I love that Heinlein has a more positive, you know, as a science fiction prophet, he's got a more positive, most of his stuff is on a more positive kind of Star Trek, Utopian bit.
[02:19:55.591 --> 02:20:02.714]  However, his main protagonists are basically, you know, from turn-of-the-century Kansas City, so they're very realistic.
[02:20:04.446 --> 02:20:05.267]  Absolutely.
[02:20:05.267 --> 02:20:13.554]  It is a global monopoly of interlocking corporations, less than really 20 that own the Fortune 100, who are engaged in a hostile takeover of the family, national government, state governments, the churches,
[02:20:27.526 --> 02:20:28.407]  That's it.
[02:20:28.407 --> 02:20:29.687]  You've crystallized it.
[02:20:29.687 --> 02:20:39.533]  We need to break up these trusts, break up these monopolies, because they're not free market, and they're working against the interest of the individual.
[02:20:39.533 --> 02:20:40.694]  The law is already on the books.
[02:20:40.694 --> 02:20:43.276]  I mean, the Sherman Antitrust Act was in 1890.
[02:20:43.276 --> 02:20:44.757]  Reagan stopped it.
[02:20:44.757 --> 02:20:45.977]  You know, and it's already there.
[02:20:45.977 --> 02:20:50.320]  I thought the Sherman Antitrust Act was 1906, but... Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:50.820]  I thought it was 1897.
[02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:51.881]  I don't know.
[02:20:51.881 --> 02:20:52.341]  Let's look.
[02:20:52.341 --> 02:20:54.363]  Guys, Google Sherman Antitrust Act.
[02:20:54.363 --> 02:20:56.344]  Check with the NSA two-way mirror.
[02:20:57.293 --> 02:21:01.796]  I'm not as good as you, Mike, you know, because you... No, I'm not saying I'm better than you.
[02:21:01.796 --> 02:21:03.377]  I'm checking to see if I'm accurate.
[02:21:03.377 --> 02:21:04.978]  You brought up the absolute solution here.
[02:21:04.978 --> 02:21:05.979]  It's one of the biggest solutions.
[02:21:05.979 --> 02:21:07.219]  You're right.
[02:21:07.219 --> 02:21:17.886]  I do not know how you do this six days a week, and I don't want to get all, oh, thank you, or whatever, but I sure appreciate the fact that you are willing to tell truth.
[02:21:17.886 --> 02:21:22.289]  It may not even be the right truth or the wrong truth, but you know, at the minimum, I trust that it
[02:21:23.422 --> 02:21:25.604]  Well, by the way, let me just correct myself.
[02:21:25.604 --> 02:21:33.469]  The Sherman Antitrust Act is 1890, but I think there was an expansion of it in 1906, I think was the key.
[02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:35.190]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:36.711]  There it is.
[02:21:36.711 --> 02:21:38.813]  And I have a shirt idea for you.
[02:21:38.813 --> 02:21:39.373]  That's right.
[02:21:39.373 --> 02:21:42.856]  Theodore Roosevelt finally enforced it in 1906.
[02:21:42.856 --> 02:21:44.417]  But you're right, it's 1890.
[02:21:44.417 --> 02:21:45.698]  Sorry, go ahead, ma'am.
[02:21:45.698 --> 02:21:47.519]  I have a shirt idea for you, too.
[02:21:47.519 --> 02:21:48.560]  Okay.
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:52.803]  I think you should do an NSSA shirt using the little SSA.
[02:21:53.325 --> 02:21:56.830]  You know, Insignia.
[02:21:56.830 --> 02:21:57.071]  Right?
[02:21:57.071 --> 02:21:59.535]  Are you tracking?
[02:21:59.535 --> 02:22:01.998]  Explain what the NFFA stands for?
[02:22:01.998 --> 02:22:02.840]  No, no, no.
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:06.145]  Like Nevada, Sierra, Sierra, Alpha.
[02:22:06.145 --> 02:22:07.767]  NSSA.
[02:22:07.767 --> 02:22:08.048]  Yeah.
[02:22:09.505 --> 02:22:10.847]  And what is it?
[02:22:10.847 --> 02:22:15.855]  Like your tyranny response team shirt, which I have in my closet that I ordered from Infowars.com.
[02:22:15.855 --> 02:22:17.257]  Thank you.
[02:22:17.257 --> 02:22:21.884]  You know, the tyranny response team shirt where it looks like the little, you know, police shirts or whatever.
[02:22:21.884 --> 02:22:23.266]  I think you should do one that's like NSSA.
[02:22:26.336 --> 02:22:26.797]  I get it.
[02:22:26.797 --> 02:22:34.600]  In fact, I said I was going to make one as a pun on them because they're trying to shut down free speech criticism of the NSA and TSA and then that's great.
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:43.064]  The National Socialist or the National Soviet System of America.
[02:22:43.064 --> 02:22:45.545]  What does NSSA stand for in your mind?
[02:22:46.952 --> 02:23:01.819]  Well, I just kind of like the visual of those NF, you know, the SS, like Nazi swastikas in the middle of the N and the A. I think that says a lot, you know, that I think that that would be a visual that people would be like, oh, you know, that, that's going to cause controversy.
[02:23:01.819 --> 02:23:02.119]  Okay.
[02:23:02.119 --> 02:23:03.259]  And one more thing.
[02:23:03.259 --> 02:23:07.261]  I want you to read a poem by Emily Dickinson called I Died for Beauty.
[02:23:07.261 --> 02:23:08.082]  It's three stanzas.
[02:23:08.082 --> 02:23:08.762]  It's not real long.
[02:23:09.178 --> 02:23:18.565]  This is the only way I get through life, Emily Dickinson, and it has been a blessing to know that someone like Emily Dickinson fully got what you and a lot of people are talking about.
[02:23:18.565 --> 02:23:20.426]  Wait a minute, I think I've read that poem before.
[02:23:20.426 --> 02:23:23.949]  Guys, will you print me, uh, I'll Die for Beauty?
[02:23:23.949 --> 02:23:27.311]  Or, or, or, what's the exact name of it?
[02:23:27.311 --> 02:23:29.373]  I Died for Beauty by Emily Dickinson.
[02:23:29.373 --> 02:23:33.235]  Yeah, I think I've read I've Died, or I'd Die for Beauty.
[02:23:33.235 --> 02:23:36.217]  I have it up if you would like me to read it, but I know you may have some other poems.
[02:23:36.217 --> 02:23:38.159]  No, no, no, you go ahead and read it.
[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:43.022]  Alright, this is called I Died for Beauty by Emily Dickinson.
[02:23:43.022 --> 02:23:50.965]  I died for beauty, but was scarce, adjusted in the tomb when one who died for truth was lain in an adjoining room.
[02:23:50.965 --> 02:23:53.266]  He questioned softly why I failed.
[02:23:53.266 --> 02:23:55.947]  For beauty, I replied, and I for truth.
[02:23:55.947 --> 02:23:57.088]  The two are one.
[02:23:57.088 --> 02:23:58.369]  We brethren are, he said.
[02:23:58.369 --> 02:24:05.892]  And so, as Kinson met a knight, we talked between the rooms until the moth had reached our lips and covered up our names.
[02:24:07.406 --> 02:24:10.108]  So there is truth and beauty.
[02:24:10.108 --> 02:24:16.834]  You know, even when the truth is ugly, there's still some beauty in just knowing the truth.
[02:24:16.834 --> 02:24:18.255]  And I appreciate you for bringing it, too.
[02:24:19.130 --> 02:24:21.511]  To a lot of us here on planet Earth.
[02:24:21.511 --> 02:24:22.211]  You are appreciated.
[02:24:22.211 --> 02:24:22.972]  Oh my gosh.
[02:24:22.972 --> 02:24:23.972]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:24:23.972 --> 02:24:24.913]  I'm very humbled by that.
[02:24:24.913 --> 02:24:25.453]  And God bless you.
[02:24:25.453 --> 02:24:26.534]  I appreciate your call, Bibi.
[02:24:26.534 --> 02:24:32.436]  You know, I'll tell you, when I've been on air a long time, I start kind of babbling and it's really hard to even string sentences together.
[02:24:32.436 --> 02:24:38.079]  And when people call up and tell me that I'm doing a great job, I'm just trying to survive and build a future just like you are.
[02:24:38.079 --> 02:24:40.280]  And I am humbled by that.
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:41.741]  And so thank you so much.
[02:24:43.356 --> 02:25:09.415]  That's what it comes down to is a value of truth, a value of justice, a value of not being discriminated against by big monopoly combines that are literally trying to end a future ladder of success to everyone so that they can dominate and run our lives in a ruthless quest of control freak vision that can never be quenched.
[02:25:10.598 --> 02:25:16.700]  It really comes down to that, and these people really are more evil than I can even describe.
[02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:20.021]  Countries always demonize the other country they're going to attack.
[02:25:20.021 --> 02:25:23.903]  Well, we're under globalist attack, and they've demonized basic liberty.
[02:25:23.903 --> 02:25:40.169]  I cannot describe in my mental lexicon, semantically, how unmitigatedly raw and wicked and just destructive the globalists are.
[02:25:41.291 --> 02:25:45.895]  Their evil is so complex, so deep, that it boggles the mind.
[02:25:45.895 --> 02:25:49.078]  I'll take three more calls and then end the show, but I've got to make this point.
[02:25:49.078 --> 02:25:57.386]  And I've tried to make this point before, but it's so complex that I feebly can't explain all the different data that go into it, all the datum.
[02:25:57.386 --> 02:26:05.414]  The globalists say they're establishing world government to forcibly reduce population because humans are like a plague, eating through the resources and damaging the earth.
[02:26:06.832 --> 02:26:26.645]  And then meanwhile they block development of really clean technologies, roll out fake alternative technologies that don't mitigate anything, engage in open genetic engineering, nuclear reactors melting down, biological pollution, all these horrible things, and then put in policies in the late 1940s
[02:26:29.229 --> 02:26:51.106]  And the British Commission on Population, I read the whole thing, it's like 200 pages long, admitted all this in 1949, His Royal Highness' Commission, Queen Elizabeth's dad, that they would actually help the Third World explode to have a giant population, to then use them as an army of slaves to de-industrialize the West, and then kill them off later.
[02:26:51.106 --> 02:26:57.251]  So, the globalists actually didn't allow the clean industrialization of the Third World or the West,
[02:26:58.795 --> 02:27:15.190]  And then caused a population explosion to then leverage out and bankrupt the West and then have the third world fall into squalor they'd never been in before as a financial black hole to suck down everyone else.
[02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:17.953]  I mean, whoa, that is so satanic.
[02:27:19.105 --> 02:27:29.918]  And then they run around lecturing everyone all day about how they're doing all this evil stuff to save the earth when they're not even doing that!
[02:27:29.918 --> 02:27:34.123]  It'd be one thing if they were putting poison in the water to actually try to reduce population.
[02:27:34.123 --> 02:27:35.064]  That'd be evil enough!
[02:27:37.426 --> 02:27:42.688]  They're just doing it because they like to watch us get sick and die and laugh at us when we're all mentally retarded.
[02:27:42.688 --> 02:27:44.948]  I mean, it's just evil, folks.
[02:27:44.948 --> 02:27:52.370]  It's like Bradley Manning said, watching drones kill people was like watching a mean kid burn ants with a magnifying glass.
[02:27:52.370 --> 02:27:56.772]  Or George Bush stick, you know, firecrackers in dogs' rear ends or whatever.
[02:27:56.772 --> 02:28:03.254]  I mean, you know, it is beyond, it's a thousand light years beyond Jeffrey Dahmer's nightmares.
[02:28:05.535 --> 02:28:07.777]  I've studied these people, and I know who they are.
[02:28:07.777 --> 02:28:10.979]  And you're like, well, they're so evil, why would they kill you?
[02:28:10.979 --> 02:28:21.387]  Because it would put a big yellow exclamation mark, a big highlighted, you know, screaming sign that I was correct.
[02:28:21.387 --> 02:28:26.710]  Plus, in their argument, we're already done, so what does it matter?
[02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:32.615]  I mean, they kind of like hearing that what they've done is so horrible, it's almost like I'm
[02:28:34.304 --> 02:28:38.229]  Heralding their satanic arrival, even though I'm not with them.
[02:28:38.229 --> 02:28:41.674]  And the public just can't even begin to understand how real this is.
[02:28:41.674 --> 02:28:44.538]  I mean, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:44.538 --> 02:28:50.406]  I cannot describe to you the black pits of evil that are the hearts of these people we're dealing with.
[02:28:51.468 --> 02:28:57.330]  I mean, if you don't believe in God, the devil, whatever, they're picking up on some energy source, some transmission from hell.
[02:28:57.330 --> 02:28:59.010]  I don't know what you want to call it.
[02:28:59.010 --> 02:29:10.193]  This makes Final Fantasy Hellraiser Event Horizon look like a picnic destination, okay?
[02:29:10.193 --> 02:29:12.894]  Okay, I mean, these people are not people, okay?
[02:29:12.894 --> 02:29:14.254]  I'm here to tell you.
[02:29:14.254 --> 02:29:16.515]  And I have seen what they're into.
[02:29:16.515 --> 02:29:17.095]  I've studied it.
[02:29:18.820 --> 02:29:22.561]  And I pick up on what they're into, and let me tell you something.
[02:29:22.561 --> 02:29:26.803]  It will curl your hair.
[02:29:26.803 --> 02:29:27.863]  And people go, well, that's scary.
[02:29:27.863 --> 02:29:28.923]  I better roll over to them.
[02:29:28.923 --> 02:29:30.124]  That won't save you.
[02:29:30.124 --> 02:29:31.924]  And you can't run.
[02:29:31.924 --> 02:29:34.445]  You gotta fight, folks.
[02:29:34.445 --> 02:29:38.027]  And the first thing is you've gotta admit how evil they are.
[02:29:38.027 --> 02:29:39.827]  I'm telling you, it comes down to that.
[02:29:39.827 --> 02:29:45.029]  And then you gotta make decisions to get out of their system as much as you can.
[02:29:45.029 --> 02:29:45.209]  But
[02:29:47.199 --> 02:29:51.040]  Humans are adaptable, so we've adapted to the evil.
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:53.501]  They've used our own adaptability against us.
[02:29:53.501 --> 02:29:57.323]  Real fast, Lola in the Midwest, go ahead.
[02:29:57.323 --> 02:30:06.446]  Yes, I just wanted to say first off that my 10-year-old son talks about you a lot in school and he's been informing people.
[02:30:06.446 --> 02:30:08.887]  Also, we are also taking your nascent iodine.
[02:30:09.465 --> 02:30:10.245]  Well, thank you, ma'am.
[02:30:10.245 --> 02:30:15.609]  Not only does it support the broadcast and what we do, my children take it, my wife takes it, I take it.
[02:30:15.609 --> 02:30:21.452]  I believe, from my research, it's the very best product I could bring you, so thank you for your financial support.
[02:30:21.452 --> 02:30:28.857]  Yes, and I just also wanted to say the big thing to wake people up is going to city council meetings and speaking up.
[02:30:28.857 --> 02:30:38.523]  In the city that I was in, there was a lot of crime going on and they wanted to bring more subsidized housing into it, but I was showing them the crime statistics.
[02:30:39.252 --> 02:30:39.532]  I don't
[02:30:57.822 --> 02:31:09.769]  To sexually harass me and shut me up, and also it made the news, and their conclusion was they couldn't confirm or deny what the police officer had did, but that did not stop me.
[02:31:09.769 --> 02:31:21.916]  I continued to talk at the city council meetings, and people, no matter what they try to do to threaten you, we need to stand up, talk, inform people, especially at the city council meeting.
[02:31:22.898 --> 02:31:29.481]  Yeah, they sent the Travis County SWAT team to threaten me once when I was going to speak every week at Citizens Communication at the County Commission.
[02:31:29.481 --> 02:31:30.281]  This is all on video.
[02:31:30.281 --> 02:31:33.183]  We've got to dig it up and put it on YouTube.
[02:31:33.183 --> 02:31:36.084]  And I blew up at the SWAT team and just said, you're a bunch of traitors.
[02:31:36.084 --> 02:31:38.445]  You know, how dare you try to intimidate me and tell me not to speak?
[02:31:38.445 --> 02:31:42.087]  You know, basically, I'm ready to fight you right now.
[02:31:42.087 --> 02:31:44.107]  And then they all went, oh, come over to our office.
[02:31:44.107 --> 02:31:45.448]  And the head guy's like, I'm a listener.
[02:31:45.448 --> 02:31:46.328]  They told us to do it.
[02:31:46.328 --> 02:31:47.529]  We're sorry.
[02:31:47.529 --> 02:31:50.850]  So they fired him, basically, over that.
[02:31:53.223 --> 02:31:53.523]  I know.
[02:31:53.523 --> 02:31:56.284]  I mean, look at Baca in LA County.
[02:31:56.284 --> 02:32:00.605]  It's now come out that they hire criminals on purpose.
[02:32:00.605 --> 02:32:02.245]  Of course they did.
[02:32:02.245 --> 02:32:03.526]  Right.
[02:32:03.526 --> 02:32:13.128]  And then when it went into the media, I saw all the comments and people were like, oh my gosh, this poor police officer, look what she's accusing him of.
[02:32:13.604 --> 02:32:20.190]  You know, he must be right because he wears the badge and she must be wrong trying to get some money out of the state.
[02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:25.976]  But those very same people know that the cops are bad in Mexico and North Korea and China and Russia.
[02:32:25.976 --> 02:32:31.822]  I mean, you know, in most histories, the police end up being oppressive.
[02:32:31.822 --> 02:32:32.022]  Right.
[02:32:33.086 --> 02:32:34.788]  I mean, the redcoats were oppressive.
[02:32:34.788 --> 02:32:36.390]  That's one reason for rebellion.
[02:32:36.390 --> 02:32:47.844]  George Washington hung people for doing stuff cops do today, because he knew, propaganda-wise, he had to have the highest level of moral military, or they would lose the war.
[02:32:47.844 --> 02:32:50.747]  He said, morally, we must be the best army in the world.
[02:32:51.613 --> 02:32:58.397]  And because they were so moral, a bunch of different German generals and people came over and actually helped towards Washington.
[02:32:58.397 --> 02:32:59.257]  That's a whole other story.
[02:32:59.257 --> 02:33:00.518]  God bless you, and I appreciate your call.
[02:33:00.518 --> 02:33:02.759]  I appreciate the crew staying late tonight as well.
[02:33:02.759 --> 02:33:04.600]  Two final callers, Ben and Tony.
[02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:05.761]  Thanks for holding, Ben.
[02:33:05.761 --> 02:33:06.341]  You're on the air.
[02:33:06.341 --> 02:33:08.622]  Hi, Alex.
[02:33:08.622 --> 02:33:10.423]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:33:10.423 --> 02:33:10.943]  You bet, brother.
[02:33:10.943 --> 02:33:11.884]  Your phone's a little low.
[02:33:11.884 --> 02:33:12.824]  Speak up for me.
[02:33:12.824 --> 02:33:13.285]  Okay, sorry.
[02:33:13.285 --> 02:33:14.265]  I can hear you now.
[02:33:14.265 --> 02:33:14.826]  Go ahead.
[02:33:14.826 --> 02:33:15.486]  Okay.
[02:33:15.486 --> 02:33:19.148]  I want to just quickly talk about the problem with social services.
[02:33:19.949 --> 02:33:25.433]  And how they're, um, you know, the pattern of them constantly... Oh, well, that's like the Patriot Act is called patriotic.
[02:33:25.433 --> 02:33:27.835]  The Affordable Care Act is called affordable.
[02:33:27.835 --> 02:33:30.076]  Uh, the New Freedom Initiative is called New Freedom.
[02:33:30.076 --> 02:33:32.298]  It's all the opposite of what they call it.
[02:33:32.298 --> 02:33:36.220]  Social services were set up 110 years ago, roughly.
[02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:44.006]  Well, before that in England, but here about 110 years ago, to break up the family and to carry out racial hygiene.
[02:33:44.006 --> 02:33:46.127]  Okay, so that, so, so they're outside law.
[02:33:46.127 --> 02:33:48.949]  The family courts are a fraud of a scheduled fraud.
[02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:52.211]  Pre-Agenda 21.
[02:33:52.211 --> 02:33:54.131]  They are their own fraudulent system.
[02:33:54.131 --> 02:33:55.951]  So, yes, go ahead.
[02:33:55.951 --> 02:34:16.316]  Yeah, well, specifically I wanted to talk about an article that I found on the Telegraph, Wheel of Telegraph's website, which I noticed you had linked on your site, about a, yes, over in the UK, a pregnant Italian woman went over to visit in the UK and she got some
[02:34:17.273 --> 02:34:18.594]  Hang on, I've got the article here.
[02:34:18.594 --> 02:34:28.339]  She had some type of problem with her boyfriend, so they forced a cesarean section because they wanted the baby immediately to be adopted, and now 15 months later she can't get her baby back.
[02:34:28.339 --> 02:34:36.623]  So they literally chopped her open early, forced surgery to steal her baby as an act of a sacrament of state dominance over her.
[02:34:36.623 --> 02:34:38.804]  Child taken from womb by social services.
[02:34:39.304 --> 02:34:47.613]  Essex Social Services has obtained a court order against a woman that allowed her to be forcibly sedated and for her child to be taken from her womb by cesarean section.
[02:34:47.613 --> 02:34:48.254]  Have you ever seen that?
[02:34:48.254 --> 02:34:49.515]  That's hardcore surgery.
[02:34:49.515 --> 02:34:51.918]  A pregnant woman... I guarantee you they sterilized her while they were at it.
[02:34:51.918 --> 02:34:53.019]  That's why they did that.
[02:34:53.019 --> 02:34:57.684]  A pregnant woman has had her baby forcibly removed by cesarean by social workers.
[02:34:57.684 --> 02:34:59.866]  You mean by demonic child kidnapping forces.
[02:34:59.866 --> 02:35:00.047]  Yes.
[02:35:00.467 --> 02:35:01.228]  Yeah, no, no.
[02:35:01.228 --> 02:35:02.989]  I was absolutely horrified when I read that.
[02:35:02.989 --> 02:35:04.650]  I've never read anything like that.
[02:35:04.650 --> 02:35:10.174]  I've had members of the British Parliament on that say, if you're pregnant, don't go to the UK, they'll body snatch your baby.
[02:35:10.174 --> 02:35:14.117]  And by the way, they hire foreigners who don't even speak English to do it.
[02:35:14.117 --> 02:35:17.499]  Most of the social services in England are now foreigners.
[02:35:17.499 --> 02:35:17.820]  Go ahead.
[02:35:18.837 --> 02:35:23.880]  Yeah, um, anyway, so, yeah, so she had- From the former Soviet Union, I would add.
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:24.620]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:30.464]  Yeah, she had some kind of, uh, panic attack or something, and they, uh, yeah, anyway, so she, she, she called for help anyway.
[02:35:30.464 --> 02:35:32.465]  They put her in this, uh, psychiatric ward.
[02:35:33.174 --> 02:35:44.220]  And then after she was in there for a few weeks, the social workers deemed that for, quote-unquote, the safety of the baby, they forcibly drugged her.
[02:35:44.220 --> 02:35:57.147]  No, no, G. Gordon Liddy, way back when he had a radio show, I remember hearing it, his producer voiceover lady, like, ooh, G. Gordon Liddy, a famous voice actress, no criminal record, her dad had just died.
[02:35:58.516 --> 02:36:00.637]  And she kept seeing these ads, are you depressed?
[02:36:00.637 --> 02:36:02.637]  Do you need to talk to a counselor?
[02:36:02.637 --> 02:36:04.497]  So she calls and goes, yeah, I'm depressed, my dad died.
[02:36:04.497 --> 02:36:05.538]  They go, are you going to kill yourself?
[02:36:05.538 --> 02:36:06.558]  She goes, no, of course not.
[02:36:06.558 --> 02:36:08.078]  They go, yes, you are.
[02:36:08.078 --> 02:36:08.918]  She said, how dare you?
[02:36:08.918 --> 02:36:09.899]  And hung up the phone.
[02:36:09.899 --> 02:36:12.519]  SWAT team hit her, hit her hard, took her to a mental institution.
[02:36:12.519 --> 02:36:15.320]  Of course, she was good looking, you know what happened next.
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:18.081]  I mean, these are just places lurking with goblins.
[02:36:18.081 --> 02:36:19.001]  Go ahead.
[02:36:19.001 --> 02:36:20.321]  I know, yeah.
[02:36:20.321 --> 02:36:23.802]  So, yeah, so anyway, so they forcibly sedated her.
[02:36:24.603 --> 02:36:25.704]  I don't know.
[02:36:45.658 --> 02:36:52.783]  Um, even though now he's observed, he's observed... And by age 2, if the baby cries, it'll be put on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:36:52.783 --> 02:36:53.703]  Go ahead.
[02:36:53.703 --> 02:36:57.166]  Yeah, no, no, because... That's mental illness if you cry as a child.
[02:36:57.166 --> 02:37:00.228]  Because now, because, because, uh, so, uh, according to the article, um...
[02:37:01.519 --> 02:37:07.300]  They said that she was, um, she was having a panic attack because of, she'd gone off her, uh, bipolar medication.
[02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:08.600]  That's what the, that's what the article said.
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:09.181]  Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[02:37:09.181 --> 02:37:11.221]  They put you on the drugs that make you go crazy.
[02:37:11.221 --> 02:37:12.701]  You shouldn't be on them when you're pregnant anyways.
[02:37:12.701 --> 02:37:14.322]  They're highly toxic and then they take your child.
[02:37:14.322 --> 02:37:14.882]  God bless you.
[02:37:14.882 --> 02:37:15.862]  I hear you.
[02:37:15.862 --> 02:37:16.202]  I know.
[02:37:16.202 --> 02:37:16.962]  This is what they do.
[02:37:16.962 --> 02:37:17.762]  It's the same thing here.
[02:37:17.762 --> 02:37:23.084]  Look, when I've had three babies and we went because we know the doctor, she's a nice lady, but it didn't matter.
[02:37:23.084 --> 02:37:24.904]  It was a brand new, nice hospital we went to.
[02:37:26.434 --> 02:37:34.300]  And the first time I figured it out, by the third time I had big debates with him, they'd have the head nurse come in and go, will you mind taking this file downstairs for me, Honeycakes?
[02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:38.543]  And they turn to your wife with a computer hooked under the wall and go, you got enough money?
[02:37:38.543 --> 02:37:39.844]  Is he nice to you?
[02:37:39.844 --> 02:37:41.025]  We're friends.
[02:37:41.025 --> 02:37:43.407]  And the whole thing is going to social services.
[02:37:43.407 --> 02:37:45.889]  If you say you don't have enough money, your baby's gone.
[02:37:47.566 --> 02:37:50.690]  If you say, oh, he yells at me, your baby's gone.
[02:37:50.690 --> 02:37:53.513]  If they test and there's any marijuana in your blood, your baby's gone.
[02:37:53.513 --> 02:38:00.661]  You don't know when you enter a hospital, a giant bloodthirsty spider is sitting there wanting to kidnap your children.
[02:38:00.661 --> 02:38:01.823]  Go ahead.
[02:38:01.823 --> 02:38:04.986]  Let's take the final call here.
[02:38:04.986 --> 02:38:06.027]  We're done with Tony, right?
[02:38:06.027 --> 02:38:06.888]  So who's up next here?
[02:38:07.529 --> 02:38:08.550]  Tony's next.
[02:38:08.550 --> 02:38:09.771]  We just talked to Ben in Canada.
[02:38:09.771 --> 02:38:10.611]  Thank you, Ben.
[02:38:10.611 --> 02:38:12.433]  Yeah, the whole system is there to prey on you.
[02:38:12.433 --> 02:38:15.975]  It's all militarized against you, period.
[02:38:15.975 --> 02:38:17.376]  There's no way to describe it.
[02:38:17.376 --> 02:38:19.378]  Let's talk to Tony in Michigan.
[02:38:19.378 --> 02:38:20.259]  Last caller, go ahead.
[02:38:20.259 --> 02:38:22.180]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:38:22.180 --> 02:38:24.202]  Doing alright, brother.
[02:38:24.202 --> 02:38:31.887]  First of all, I just want to say, Ben, you guys do a great job, but I know we got a lot of solutions out there, but man, we need a physical leader.
[02:38:31.887 --> 02:38:34.009]  We need somebody that's going to physically lead us.
[02:38:34.639 --> 02:38:40.803]  Well, you know, I tried to go out and protest violations of the First Amendment and got attacked by a bunch of criminal goons.
[02:38:40.803 --> 02:38:42.184]  I mean, this is what America is.
[02:38:42.184 --> 02:38:43.564]  It's a cesspit.
[02:38:43.564 --> 02:38:45.245]  I mean, I'm up here in Michigan.
[02:38:45.245 --> 02:38:49.108]  I was on the road and I was watching your videos when I was off duty while you guys were down there.
[02:38:49.108 --> 02:38:54.291]  If you would have fought back for them cops, everybody that was there with you would have stood right behind you and fought.
[02:38:55.606 --> 02:38:58.628]  All I'm saying is before it gets too out of control, man, you're a leader.
[02:38:58.628 --> 02:39:01.751]  I know you don't like to put yourself up on a pedestal, but man, you're a leader.
[02:39:01.751 --> 02:39:03.532]  You got millions of viewers.
[02:39:03.532 --> 02:39:05.614]  You got millions of followers.
[02:39:05.614 --> 02:39:11.558]  I just think that before it gets out of hand, excuse my language, you gotta physically lead, man.
[02:39:12.401 --> 02:39:13.662]  Well, I am trying to lead.
[02:39:13.662 --> 02:39:16.343]  I mean, I built a media operation.
[02:39:16.343 --> 02:39:20.125]  I'm trying to launch a TV nightly news program on cable, getting very close to that.
[02:39:20.125 --> 02:39:22.606]  I am trying to make films.
[02:39:22.606 --> 02:39:24.487]  I'm trying to manage folks.
[02:39:24.487 --> 02:39:25.988]  I'm trying to be a father.
[02:39:25.988 --> 02:39:28.069]  I try to go out and cover events.
[02:39:28.069 --> 02:39:29.169]  I go cover Bilderberg.
[02:39:29.169 --> 02:39:31.630]  I go cover First Amendment violations.
[02:39:31.630 --> 02:39:36.833]  I try to have other activists on, and 80% of the time, people that I've helped for years turn against me and
[02:39:37.133 --> 02:39:37.713]  I work, I work a lot.
[02:39:37.713 --> 02:39:40.235]  So like for me to come protest, there are a lot of people who work.
[02:39:40.235 --> 02:39:43.518]  People who come with you, you've got millions of viewers.
[02:39:43.518 --> 02:39:47.961]  You've got 10% of your viewers six months from now that we planned on
[02:40:05.359 --> 02:40:09.563]  You know, put donations in it, you know, for people to get bus tickets to meet up somewhere.
[02:40:09.563 --> 02:40:12.185]  Uh, you got 100,000 people meeting up somewhere.
[02:40:12.185 --> 02:40:17.289]  You still have the opportunity 200 years from now to have people read about you.
[02:40:18.112 --> 02:40:23.075]  I know, but what I'm saying is, what I'm saying is, what do the 100,000 people do?
[02:40:23.075 --> 02:40:27.737]  I mean, it's about getting people all over the country to take over their city council politically.
[02:40:27.737 --> 02:40:31.559]  It's about people electing good sheriffs that are constitutional.
[02:40:31.559 --> 02:40:33.580]  It's about getting good people into Congress.
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:37.162]  It's about recognizing the criminal globalist takeover.
[02:40:37.162 --> 02:40:39.343]  God bless you, and I appreciate your call, Tony.
[02:40:39.343 --> 02:40:39.583]  Listen.
[02:40:40.916 --> 02:40:43.838]  I am praying every day that I'd be a better leader.
[02:40:43.838 --> 02:40:46.299]  I am praying every day that I'd be more articulate.
[02:40:46.299 --> 02:40:51.842]  I am praying every day that I do the right media events and that I make the right decisions.
[02:40:51.842 --> 02:40:54.024]  But I mean, I'm up at 4 a.m.
[02:40:54.024 --> 02:40:56.465]  sometimes doing coast-to-coast a.m.
[02:40:56.465 --> 02:41:00.467]  I'm not complaining, but man, I'm working a lot.
[02:41:00.467 --> 02:41:07.471]  And I've even given up guilty pleasures like going to movies and drinking beer and stuff to try to even be more serious.
[02:41:10.436 --> 02:41:18.711]  So it really just comes down to, we've already had a big effect, and you're not going to see one flash event fix everything.
[02:41:19.571 --> 02:41:22.293]  We have to say to the New World Order, we reject you.
[02:41:22.293 --> 02:41:24.675]  We know you're causing most of the problems.
[02:41:24.675 --> 02:41:27.678]  You are accentuating every problem you didn't cause.
[02:41:27.678 --> 02:41:32.642]  You are letting all these crises mature so that you can pose as the savior.
[02:41:32.642 --> 02:41:33.823]  We know you're bad.
[02:41:33.823 --> 02:41:34.804]  We know you're corrupt.
[02:41:34.804 --> 02:41:44.753]  I mean, if you look at Rahm Emanuel or Barack Obama or the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers or the Queen of England or Henry Kissinger or Al Gore,
[02:41:45.959 --> 02:41:47.861]  Or Bill Clinton.
[02:41:47.861 --> 02:41:50.243]  Or all these other big, you know, New World Order types.
[02:41:50.243 --> 02:41:52.605]  I mean, they are scum!
[02:41:52.605 --> 02:41:59.931]  Playing God with our lives, and we just let them bosses around, and let them set up the future, and let them engineer everything.
[02:41:59.931 --> 02:42:04.534]  We have to become aware that the video games aren't where it's happening.
[02:42:04.534 --> 02:42:06.756]  And I'm not saying it isn't fun to play video games sometimes.
[02:42:06.756 --> 02:42:07.217]  I was playing a
[02:42:08.394 --> 02:42:08.834]  Shoot'em up!
[02:42:28.069 --> 02:42:34.811]  Decisions are being made about the future of all of our lives that are very, very detrimental and very, very bad and very, very diabolical.
[02:42:34.811 --> 02:42:41.073]  We have been kidnapped, hijacked by very vicious anti-human technocrats who really are sick people.
[02:42:41.073 --> 02:42:43.234]  And we need to become aware of that and say no.
[02:42:43.234 --> 02:42:45.634]  Well, that was a two-hour, 42-minute transmission.
[02:42:45.634 --> 02:42:47.735]  We did two hours of regular radio.
[02:42:47.735 --> 02:42:51.476]  42 minutes of overdrive.
[02:42:51.476 --> 02:42:53.117]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:42:53.117 --> 02:42:53.497]  Central.
[02:42:57.404 --> 02:42:59.625]  And please financially support us.
[02:42:59.625 --> 02:43:01.446]  Get the InfoWars Magazine subscriptions.
[02:43:01.446 --> 02:43:02.707]  Give them as gifts.
[02:43:02.707 --> 02:43:07.069]  Get the new American Coffee.
[02:43:07.069 --> 02:43:08.850]  Wake Up America Immune Support.
[02:43:11.345 --> 02:43:14.688]  It's all at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:14.688 --> 02:43:21.353]  And again, please tell the globalists that we do not want their census.
[02:43:21.353 --> 02:43:22.694]  We do not want their questions.
[02:43:22.694 --> 02:43:25.576]  We do not want them to turn us into perps.
[02:43:25.576 --> 02:43:29.779]  We do not want the police to make first contact with us, their enemy.
[02:43:29.779 --> 02:43:32.882]  We understand what's happened.
[02:43:32.882 --> 02:43:37.385]  And so we are telling them that their letter is going back.
[02:43:37.385 --> 02:43:38.986]  We reject them.
[02:43:38.986 --> 02:43:40.828]  We recognize the New World Order as the enemy.
[02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:55.173]  And it's time for everybody, whether they're the military, police, an auto mechanic, a school teacher, a doctor, a truck driver, it's time for all of us to say, return to sender.
[02:43:55.173 --> 02:43:56.855]  Alright, that's it for this transmission.
[02:43:56.855 --> 02:43:59.338]  See you back tomorrow, 11am central.
[02:43:59.338 --> 02:43:59.978]  God bless you all.
[02:44:04.619 --> 02:44:06.459]  Time to stop complying.
[02:44:31.144 --> 02:44:31.525]  I think.
