[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:03.772]  The media is now targeting the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:09.056]  And today we're going to ask the people their thoughts about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in today's world.
[00:00:09.696 --> 00:00:16.901]  Recently, Duck Dynasty's Phil Robinson was suspended from A&E over referencing the Bible about homosexuality, bestiality, and sexual perversion.
[00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:21.204]  Do you think A&E did the right thing, or is it a violation of Phil Robinson's First Amendment?
[00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:23.346]  I don't have any comment on that.
[00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:26.228]  I think it's a violation of his First Amendment rights.
[00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:30.029]  I will have to speak based on not seeing what he said, but I heard a lot about it.
[00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:41.394]  I mean, everybody has their freedom of speech, but the only problem with him is, like, you are a person, but you have a show, you're on a show, you're in the public eye, so if you want to keep that money, you gotta watch what you're saying, you know, you gotta listen to yourself.
[00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:45.915]  Do you think the First Amendment should be changed, abolished, or stay the way it is?
[00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:47.556]  No, it should stay the way it is.
[00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:48.556]  I don't think it needs to be changed.
[00:00:48.596 --> 00:00:49.197]  It's been there for 200 years.
[00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:56.118]  Definitely to stay the way it is and be more open because in a lot of countries you say something about the government and you're gone.
[00:00:56.298 --> 00:00:56.938]  Stay the way it is.
[00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.461]  And your thoughts about the Bill of Rights and Constitution in today's world?
[00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:08.969]  Well, I think it's an ever-changing world and it's written in such a way that it will change as the world changes.
[00:01:09.428 --> 00:01:13.131]  We don't even follow our own constitution to the T like it should be followed.
[00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:20.276]  Constitution, even in my organization, is up to interpretation, so you have to make it so everybody interprets it the same way, and it never happens that way.
[00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:27.741]  And now, recently, Jake Taper from CNN recently stated that he thinks the American people honestly want more security over freedom.
[00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:30.864]  I think the American people, honestly,
[00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:33.627]  Want security over freedom.
[00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:39.535]  Benjamin Franklin quoted, any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will get or deserve neither.
[00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:41.037]  Now whose statement do you agree with?
[00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:42.098]  Ben Franklin's.
[00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.520]  Who do you agree with?
[00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:45.778]  A little bit of both.
[00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:51.743]  You kind of need to give up some freedom to get freedoms, but there's going to be a limitation on how much freedom you have to give up.
[00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:52.884]  Year review for 2013.
[00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:55.747]  Which news event will you remember the most?
[00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:57.549]  Probably the school shootings.
[00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:58.810]  There's been a lot of shootings.
[00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.374]  At the moment, I remember Mandela's death.
[00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:05.396]  What do you think the government should do to protect us in 2014?
[00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:08.965]  Uh, that's a good question.
[00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:11.367]  Hopefully they don't have to protect us too much.
[00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:19.394]  2013 has brought nothing but a huge onslaught to our civil liberties, our Bill of Rights, and our Constitution by the mainstream media and our government.
[00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:25.299]  But in light of that, many Americans are still willing to fight for the civil liberties that we have left.
[00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.504]  And on behalf of myself and InfoWars.com, we'd like to wish you a Happy New Year and God Bless.
[00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:34.907]  And this is Dan Bodondi reporting for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:48.065]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:50.647]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:02:50.947 --> 00:03:00.636]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:09.199]  And that's why we're rolling out on a 100% Made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
