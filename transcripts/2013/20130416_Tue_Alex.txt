[00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:10.231]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:11.812]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.373]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:17.556]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:21.639]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:31.133]  It is 11 a.m.
[00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:35.577]  Central Standard Time on the 16th day of April, 2013.
[00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:43.383]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next 10, 11 hours or so.
[00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:46.946]  And again, in the future, we're going to have even more reporters and crew.
[00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:50.949]  We'll be able to easily go 24 hours straight or longer.
[00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.753]  But this is the big official foundation of our entire media operation.
[00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:58.156]  To awaken humanity to the globalist peril.
[00:00:58.156 --> 00:00:59.798]  This is the Big Radio Show.
[00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:08.908]  We also simulcast video at InfoWars.com and of course PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:08.908 --> 00:01:15.275]  Bottom line, you know that I've been saying there'll be false flag IED, improvised explosive device attacks all over the country.
[00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:18.214]  Because I know the scripting.
[00:01:18.214 --> 00:01:23.640]  And the globalists always train police and others for the narrative they're going to carry out.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.566]  Whether it's staged events, provocateured, or organic, which are very rare.
[00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.389]  These terror attacks are rare, period.
[00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:37.234]  The system will use this to roll out TSA in the malls on the streets of America.
[00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:45.117]  And basically a rationing up of the overall martial law type atmosphere.
[00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:46.798]  Before I went live, Obama spoke.
[00:01:46.798 --> 00:01:47.898]  We're going to find that clip.
[00:01:47.898 --> 00:01:49.839]  It was about 30 minutes ago.
[00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:51.339]  I watched his press conference.
[00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:52.760]  It's Obama's new press conference.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.600]  It's up at whitehouse.gov.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.682]  He's wearing a really ugly tie, black and white speckled tie.
[00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:02.423]  People that want to be able to find which one of the fear-mongering press conferences it was.
[00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:07.207]  Uh, and he says, listen, I'm telling you it's terror.
[00:02:07.207 --> 00:02:13.433]  Like, oh, now it's terror because the president said, you know, like you go outside, it's a blue sky.
[00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.835]  I don't know if it's daytime.
[00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:16.637]  You go turn on the press conference.
[00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:18.178]  Oh, the president says it's daytime.
[00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:18.739]  It's daytime.
[00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:23.839]  Or if it's night time, you've got to tune in to the President.
[00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.761]  The President's like, it is night time in the Eastern Time Zone.
[00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:30.443]  You go out and go, okay, it's night time.
[00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:32.324]  Obviously, this is terrorism.
[00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:39.467]  Bombs at a world famous sporting event, killing people, that is an act of terrorism.
[00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:40.448]  An act of terrorism.
[00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:43.609]  I heard some talk shows last night going, well, only if it was a political group.
[00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:44.370]  No.
[00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.672]  Terrorism is an individual group, corporation, it doesn't matter, doing something
[00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:58.775]  To scare a population into something political or military or financial you want.
[00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:01.756]  Or it can be if you're just insane.
[00:03:01.756 --> 00:03:08.077]  And I'd say there's maybe one chance out of a hundred, conservatively, that this is some lone nut.
[00:03:08.077 --> 00:03:11.898]  Now, I came out as this was announced with Richard Belzer.
[00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:18.820]  Within two minutes of it happening, our phone system filled up with people
[00:03:20.182 --> 00:03:21.783]  You know, saying that they'd seen this.
[00:03:21.783 --> 00:03:26.667]  We were one of the first to report it, right as it was only tweeted by the Boston Globe.
[00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.290]  And I said, look, it's Patriots Day.
[00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.213]  They're probably going to blame this on right-wing groups or Muslims.
[00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.716]  But notice how now they're saying right-wing and Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.997]  It just goes together.
[00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:40.719]  Regardless now, is it right-wingers?
[00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.601]  There's only one thing as bad, Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:44.102 --> 00:03:53.510]  So we have seen all of that basically pushed in everyone's face, and so they're mixing and conflating the two.
[00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:11.585]  And within 10 minutes, Salon Mediaite, The Blaze, Glenn Beck came out and said, how dare, so the George Soros groups and then Glenn Beck came out and said, how dare you say this could be staged and that it'll be blamed on the Tea Party?
[00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:17.027]  Now within an hour, and I'm not exaggerating, I have ten different clips.
[00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:17.927]  We're not going to play them all.
[00:04:17.927 --> 00:04:18.948]  I'm sure you've seen them.
[00:04:18.948 --> 00:04:20.369]  We'll play some.
[00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:24.711]  Where they said, you know, the number one suspect is right-wingers.
[00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:26.492]  The White House has come out and said that.
[00:04:26.492 --> 00:04:31.255]  Axelrod, Obama thinks bombings could be related to tax day.
[00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:34.097]  The Young Turks, same deal.
[00:04:34.097 --> 00:04:39.600]  MSNBC, CNN, right-wing extremists, CNN to blame for explosions.
[00:04:41.298 --> 00:04:43.000]  Uh, and then here's the blaze.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.844]  Boston Marathon explosions already being blamed on the right.
[00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:49.848]  They were simultaneously attacking us for saying that while they were saying it too.
[00:04:49.848 --> 00:04:51.791]  I'm just tired of it.
[00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.415]  It's bad enough dealing with the globalists, but... Alright, we're gonna break it all down.
[00:04:55.415 --> 00:04:57.357]  Here's London Independent saying it's right-wing groups.
[00:04:57.357 --> 00:04:57.738]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:02.590]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.992]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:05:04.992 --> 00:05:10.475]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:14.517]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:05:14.517 --> 00:05:18.439]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.840]  The fact is, you are.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.861]  We all are.
[00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:23.182]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:05:23.502 --> 00:05:32.050]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:06.241]  We are on the march.
[00:08:06.241 --> 00:08:09.424]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:13.147]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.359 --> 00:08:24.835]  Ladies and gentlemen, while we are busy analyzing what really happened at the mystery false flag...
[00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:33.960]  While we're busy watching the White House surrogates come out and say, oh, it's a right-wing Tea Party person, that was very predictable.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:50.670]  I was attacked just minutes after it happened by known White House front groups like Salon and others, and of course Media Matters, which isn't actually run by the White House, for saying, hey, they're going to blame it on the Tea Party.
[00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.512]  And then minutes later, they did, in those very publications,
[00:08:57.133 --> 00:09:08.901]  I mean, this is the magnitude of, I say, watch, they're going to blame us, or they're going to try to, and then they go, look, you're a crazy conspiracy theorist, but yes, we are going to try to blame you.
[00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:12.623]  But you're wrong because you're right, and you're crazy because you're right.
[00:09:12.623 --> 00:09:15.325]  It'd be like if I was sitting there fishing in a rowboat,
[00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:30.437]  And there was a bridge over it, and I saw a sports car fly off the road at 100 miles an hour off the bridge, and I said to myself, hey, that's going to crash into the side of the bank or into the water.
[00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:34.941]  And if I looked at somebody, you know, in those few seconds, they said, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:40.945]  As the car is dukes of hazarding out over the river, hey, that thing's going to crash.
[00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:42.527]  Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:09:44.022 --> 00:09:47.103]  You see, none of us are allowed to be involved in the narrative.
[00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:52.985]  None of us are allowed to speculate, ask questions like, gee, it's Patriots Day in Boston.
[00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:57.247]  Gee, do you think they're going to try to blame a right-wing group?
[00:09:57.247 --> 00:10:04.890]  They were only putting out Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL memos last month saying domestic terror attacks are imminent.
[00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.731]  We warned you right before the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:10.012]  We warned Bill Clinton.
[00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.092]  And now we're warning you, Obama, the attacks are imminent.
[00:10:15.092 --> 00:10:16.353]  You can look that up.
[00:10:16.353 --> 00:10:28.441]  And you've got all these dramas and sitcoms and movies with propaganda placement saying the Tea Party is going to bomb people at public events and they're the new enemy, not Al Qaeda.
[00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:34.685]  And then you have this happen where the country started, where the Revolutionary War, where 1776 started in 1775, Lexington, Concord, Boston.
[00:10:40.694 --> 00:10:42.675]  Patriots Day, April 15th.
[00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:46.077]  In Boston, the real Patriots Day is the 19th.
[00:10:46.077 --> 00:10:49.760]  Stuart Rhodes is on his way there, driving right now.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.901]  He's going to be joining us later in the broadcast of Oath Keepers.
[00:10:52.901 --> 00:10:55.723]  And he's like, oh yeah, false flag all over it.
[00:10:55.723 --> 00:10:59.185]  A constitutional lawyer, army paratrooper, head of Oath Keepers.
[00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:01.447]  And look, they may change the script.
[00:11:01.447 --> 00:11:06.750]  When their stuff doesn't go well, like the Olympic Park bombing, they'll try to frame a patsy like Richard Jewell.
[00:11:08.038 --> 00:11:14.945]  I mean, the World Trade Center was bombed by the FBI in 1993, the New York Times reported.
[00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:24.394]  They cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, found guys with 75, one had a 75, one had an 80 IQ, they were both on welfare, and their test scores got released.
[00:11:24.394 --> 00:11:31.541]  I mean, they were literally mentally retarded Muslims, who then the FBI informed us, like, you're going to give them real bombs now?
[00:11:32.242 --> 00:11:37.330]  And then he figured out they were going to set him up, so he recorded them saying, go ahead with the bombing.
[00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:44.120]  And that's the only reason that Ahmad Salam got paid off $1.4 million and went back to Egypt.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.924]  He was an Egyptian CIA guy, or their CIA.
[00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:50.828]  And he figured out he had a press conference with his lawyer the day after.
[00:11:50.828 --> 00:11:53.230]  He goes, and I figured out they were setting me up.
[00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.331]  I'm not stupid.
[00:11:54.331 --> 00:11:55.832]  They promised you build a fake bomb.
[00:11:55.832 --> 00:11:56.893]  Now build a real one.
[00:11:56.893 --> 00:11:57.674]  Fake detonators.
[00:11:57.674 --> 00:11:59.136]  No, now real detonators.
[00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:00.096]  Now load the truck.
[00:12:00.096 --> 00:12:01.538]  No, I don't want to load the truck.
[00:12:01.538 --> 00:12:02.459]  Well, you've got to.
[00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:04.120]  Well, now just let them drive it.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.381]  We're going to stop them.
[00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:09.125]  And the day before he starts recording them because he was not stupid.
[00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:11.147]  He's like, oh my gosh, they're going to set me up.
[00:12:11.727 --> 00:12:14.289]  They did set McVeigh up two years later.
[00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:16.370]  And that's a little lesson for you folks.
[00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.571]  Don't take part in a drill.
[00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:25.297]  7-7, they set up local mainline liberal Muslims who were school teachers and stuff to be part of a terror drill.
[00:12:25.297 --> 00:12:28.059]  One of them figured it out and the police killed him at Canary Wharf.
[00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:29.160]  That was in the back of the paper.
[00:12:30.748 --> 00:12:48.240]  They bombed the same trains, the same bus at the exact same time, and even reported, we're going to play this later, on ITN and BBC, the head of visor consultancy, hit it in plain view, Peter Power, formerly the head of Scotland Yard PR, Public Relations, that, oh, they ran a drill
[00:12:49.431 --> 00:12:58.159]  With the Metro and with the Metro Police and Scotland Yarn of bombing the exact two trains and exact bus at the exact same time.
[00:12:58.159 --> 00:12:59.340]  Wait, it gets better.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.622]  At the exact same location.
[00:13:01.622 --> 00:13:04.425]  We had an insurance actuary done on that.
[00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:09.969]  It was in the, I think it was 23 plus trectogillions.
[00:13:09.969 --> 00:13:14.734]  That's billions of times more than all the grains of sand estimated in the world.
[00:13:16.656 --> 00:13:20.659]  And then they hit it in plain view, which is something they always do.
[00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:22.901]  Now, why do they always run a drill?
[00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:24.142]  Madrid staged bombing.
[00:13:24.142 --> 00:13:25.804]  It came out in their Spanish papers.
[00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:29.887]  The president had to resign on 3-3-3, 2003.
[00:13:29.887 --> 00:13:35.372]  Had to resign when it came out that the intelligence agencies and the Madrid police did the bombing.
[00:13:35.372 --> 00:13:37.294]  And they ended up blowing up a house full of the Patsy's.
[00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:41.817]  Putin's been caught in 99 planting bombs in a fourth building.
[00:13:41.817 --> 00:13:49.380]  When they got caught, the FSB, Federal Security Bureau, by local Moscow police, suburb of Moscow, they said, oh, it's part of a drill, let us out of jail.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:14:00.366]  You run the drill on 7-7, you run the drills, declassified on 9-11, of the exact same buildings, the Pentagon and the World Trade Centers, attacked by hijacked jets.
[00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:04.268]  And that's why NORAD tapes got released and they go, is this real world or part of the exercise?
[00:14:06.872 --> 00:14:10.454]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is how criminal elements do this.
[00:14:10.454 --> 00:14:14.317]  And that's why when you know this and watch this, you've seen it over and over again.
[00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:21.782]  And now what came out, which they're freaking out about and having their surrogates come out and demonize.
[00:14:21.782 --> 00:14:25.644]  No one in mainstream media is covering this but DrudgeReport.com.
[00:14:30.094 --> 00:14:31.676]  That's not even really mainstream media.
[00:14:31.676 --> 00:14:35.760]  Drudge has a link to this story that is in local news.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.303]  When I say mainstream, Nationals not covering it.
[00:14:38.303 --> 00:14:41.107]  Local 15 TV out of Boston.
[00:14:41.107 --> 00:14:44.530]  We're going to get to this in a little while, the video of it.
[00:14:45.563 --> 00:14:52.190]  A document cam please.
[00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.833]  Well now they're not calling them police spotters.
[00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:56.354]  Go to drudge.
[00:14:56.354 --> 00:15:01.319]  Now it's the mysterious manhunt for the mysterious man in the hoodie.
[00:15:01.319 --> 00:15:03.161]  There were cops all over the roofs in hoodies.
[00:15:03.161 --> 00:15:03.922]  We've got the video.
[00:15:03.922 --> 00:15:04.723]  We've got the photos.
[00:15:06.618 --> 00:15:12.161]  People try to spin that, and they say, well, you know what's happening here.
[00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.942]  You know, they always have bob-sniffing dogs now at all these events.
[00:15:14.942 --> 00:15:16.383]  Aren't you glad they're keeping us safe?
[00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:20.124]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's go further.
[00:15:20.124 --> 00:15:25.607]  Ollie Stevenson, the marathon coach,
[00:15:27.682 --> 00:15:38.448]  University of Mobile's cross-country coach, who was near the finish line of the Boston Marathon when a series of explosions went off, said he thought it was odd there were bomb-sniffing dogs at the start and finish lines.
[00:15:38.448 --> 00:15:42.990]  They kept making announcements to the participants, don't worry, it's just a training exercise.
[00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.172]  Now, our own Dan Bodondi said Ali Stevenson on Local 15.
[00:15:47.172 --> 00:15:52.455]  That is nowhere in the national news, unless it's the alternative news of InfoWars.com.
[00:15:53.715 --> 00:15:58.678]  PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and DrugsReport.com.
[00:15:58.678 --> 00:16:09.023]  And I did tune in last night to the guest that's joining us, Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network, who was on Monday saying staged attacks to be blamed on patriots are imminent.
[00:16:09.023 --> 00:16:13.326]  Obama is doubling down, according to his federal source, who I was able to talk to yesterday.
[00:16:15.157 --> 00:16:18.022]  In the morning before this happened, he said, get ready.
[00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:20.587]  They're looking to blame something on the Patriots or the Muslims.
[00:16:20.587 --> 00:16:21.528]  Probably the Muslims.
[00:16:21.528 --> 00:16:22.891]  He said, that's all I can tell you.
[00:16:22.891 --> 00:16:24.273]  I need to call that guy back.
[00:16:24.273 --> 00:16:25.014]  The point is...
[00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:28.782]  Is that imminent is the word.
[00:16:28.782 --> 00:16:29.723]  Well, it was imminent.
[00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:32.545]  And that's why I came on air yesterday, three hours before it happened.
[00:16:32.545 --> 00:16:34.806]  And I said, we've all got to unify as the Liberty Movement.
[00:16:34.806 --> 00:16:42.932]  If you support the Bill of Rights and Constitution, transcend liberal, conservative, we've got to understand if there are attacks, giving our rights up won't protect us.
[00:16:42.932 --> 00:16:44.413]  I can feel it in my bones.
[00:16:44.413 --> 00:16:45.634]  Attacks are imminent.
[00:16:45.634 --> 00:16:49.496]  And I said, they'll want to have, they'll want to have the shot heard around the world.
[00:16:49.496 --> 00:16:53.239]  They'll want to pull the trigger because whoever shoots first loses, but blame it on us.
[00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:56.101]  I said that three times during the show yesterday.
[00:16:56.821 --> 00:16:58.243]  Don't even have the crew to go pull it.
[00:16:58.243 --> 00:17:01.368]  I just remember it because I said it over and over again.
[00:17:01.368 --> 00:17:02.089]  And isn't it funny?
[00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:06.796]  Where the shot heard around the world happened, in Boston.
[00:17:06.796 --> 00:17:11.162]  In the very same, you know, very same few days.
[00:17:11.162 --> 00:17:13.946]  And I'm telling you, this is epic what we're seeing happen.
[00:17:15.555 --> 00:17:20.297]  Now, when their first story fell apart in the Olympic Park bombing, they went and set up a Patsy.
[00:17:20.297 --> 00:17:22.718]  They set up three people for the anthrax attack.
[00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:24.098]  Turned out it was super U.S.
[00:17:24.098 --> 00:17:26.499]  weapons-grade Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[00:17:26.499 --> 00:17:28.760]  The third Patsy they grabbed, they took to a hospital.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.380]  A doctor drugged him and killed him.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:40.244]  It was a line in the back of the local paper that while in a straitjacket, he was fed prescription Tylenol until he died.
[00:17:40.244 --> 00:17:43.625]  Okay?
[00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:43.865]  So...
[00:17:46.445 --> 00:17:52.258]  Most, I would say 99% of people in the military and the police and the bomb squads are not terrorists.
[00:17:53.194 --> 00:18:00.919]  Okay, but there isn't really any terrorism or any bomb stuff going on, and usually it's a crazy firefighter or a crazy cop that does it.
[00:18:00.919 --> 00:18:02.900]  I mean, look at how many criminology cases.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:11.265]  It's someone on the bomb squad who, ten years of never having a real bomb and blowing up shopping bags that blow out of trucks on the side of the highway, they'll go plant a bomb.
[00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:13.046]  And it's always back of the paper.
[00:18:13.046 --> 00:18:20.611]  So criminology-wise, that's who you look at, and still it's a very small minority of them that do it, but statistically it's a much larger minority than the public.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.721]  But if you look at all of these events, that's the main suspects.
[00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:42.985]  And for people to go, how dare Alex Jones, like Media Matters, Salon, Mediaite, Len Beck, God bless him, all of them coming out attacking me for saying, A, they're going to blame the Tea Party or try, which then happened exactly as I said.
[00:18:42.985 --> 00:18:44.666]  I mean, it's a no-brainer.
[00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:44.966]  It's like,
[00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:49.101]  If I stick my hand in a red-hot fire, I'm going to get burned.
[00:18:49.101 --> 00:18:52.343]  Okay, there's been an attack on Patriots Day.
[00:18:52.343 --> 00:18:54.565]  It looks staged.
[00:18:54.565 --> 00:18:56.045]  Preliminary stuff, there were drills.
[00:18:56.045 --> 00:18:58.447]  That's now been confirmed.
[00:18:58.447 --> 00:19:00.868]  Okay, bomb-sniffing dogs everywhere.
[00:19:00.868 --> 00:19:02.249]  Okay, they're having a drill.
[00:19:02.249 --> 00:19:03.810]  Looks like a false flag.
[00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:14.097]  You have groups that have done this over and over again that are saying it's going to happen with every TV show, drama, sitcom at a crescendo that the right-wingers are going to bomb everybody.
[00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:22.272]  They had a Family Guy that aired two weeks ago, where the dad, who's a Tea Party guy, joins the Taliban.
[00:19:22.272 --> 00:19:26.695]  Again, that oxymoron that they're still pushing it, until people believe it.
[00:19:26.695 --> 00:19:32.919]  West Point says it, Army to crush Tea Party, Rebellion, Forbes, AP, Reuters.
[00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:33.960]  You're like, that doesn't make sense.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.681]  Now, it will make sense.
[00:19:35.681 --> 00:19:39.084]  Family Guy has him at a subconscious level.
[00:19:39.084 --> 00:19:40.064]  It's almost subliminal.
[00:19:40.064 --> 00:19:40.965]  We're going to play this coming up.
[00:19:40.965 --> 00:19:41.826]  It's up at Infowars.com.
[00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:51.053]  Bombing the Boston Marathon at the finish line with two bombs.
[00:19:51.053 --> 00:19:52.274]  With a cell phone detonator.
[00:20:00.891 --> 00:20:06.355]  American gardeners and fellow Patriots make the right choice with your money, time, and your family food supply.

[00:21:00.768 --> 00:21:02.709]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:21:02.709 --> 00:21:04.871]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:21:04.871 --> 00:21:10.554]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:21:10.554 --> 00:21:14.577]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:18.459]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:19.840]  The fact is, you are.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.860]  We all are.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.202]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[00:22:31.136 --> 00:22:35.699]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:41.523]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.523 --> 00:22:45.165]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:45.165 --> 00:22:47.987]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:23:09.342 --> 00:23:11.424]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:23:11.424 --> 00:23:12.685]  Police call it robbery.
[00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:15.523]  We call it avoidable.
[00:23:15.523 --> 00:23:21.550]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.

[00:23:26.977 --> 00:23:33.024]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.

[00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:47.478]  Yep, Willie Nelson is 80 years old this week.
[00:24:47.478 --> 00:24:52.960]  Got a chance to hang out with him a few weeks ago.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.382]  Alright, getting back to what I was breaking down here.
[00:24:58.382 --> 00:25:09.165]  You can bet that they're now announcing the new security measures, TSA, troops on the streets, checkpoints, you're all suspects, and they're all, America's gonna be strong and united in the face of this.
[00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:20.279]  And Obama's approval rating is already going up, and he's up there saying, you know, we face down the terror together, and he's the father figure.
[00:25:20.279 --> 00:25:23.241]  He's the guy protecting us as the big daddy.
[00:25:23.241 --> 00:25:30.284]  And this will be used to, across the board, take our basic liberties and our freedoms.
[00:25:31.323 --> 00:25:41.229]  And during the break I was watching CNN just breathlessly, and we've got victims, and let's cut to this senator, and the senator's all smiling.
[00:25:41.229 --> 00:25:45.211]  It's all about the government cult, getting to have everybody tune into them.
[00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:49.814]  Because the only time dinosaur media gets viewers' attention now is when there's a big event.
[00:25:51.109 --> 00:25:59.638]  And so they're all a bunch of narcissists up there and spreading the fear, but don't worry, we'll bring you a third world police state to keep you safe.
[00:25:59.638 --> 00:26:11.170]  And while we are distracted, while we are diverted by all of this,
[00:26:13.274 --> 00:26:22.481]  They are racing through the Senate now with the gun registration and psychological gun confiscation program that basically overthrows much of the Second Amendment.
[00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:26.224]  They're racing through with total open border legalization.
[00:26:26.224 --> 00:26:35.091]  And where Homeland Security has its own discretion whether to control the border at any level, which they've already opened up and are doing blanket fiat amnesty anyways.
[00:26:35.091 --> 00:26:39.855]  I mean, that's all on record.
[00:26:39.855 --> 00:26:40.576]  So we've got
[00:26:43.592 --> 00:26:45.473]  We've got that going on.
[00:26:45.473 --> 00:27:02.345]  All of this is unfolding right now, right as they're trying to pass their whole globalist North American Union agenda, right as they're trying to get warrantless wiretapping codified into law, right as they're trying to expand all this, just like 9-11 was used to ran through the Patriot Act and all the rest of it.
[00:27:02.345 --> 00:27:12.251]  And when 9-11 wasn't enough to get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, oh, then there was the anthrax attack that somebody could have made in a bathtub in their basement, turned out the most weaponized U.S.
[00:27:12.251 --> 00:27:13.352]  government version ever.
[00:27:14.353 --> 00:27:17.716]  And they finally killed the third Patsy to shut him up.
[00:27:17.716 --> 00:27:36.794]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get to this later in the hour, but if you go up to InfoWars.com, you can see all these different videos, all these different interviews we're going to cover during the next segment.
[00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:49.616]  Where you've got eyewitnesses openly reporting the fact that they were told it was a drill, never mind, don't mind what was happening, right around the area, right before the bomb went off.
[00:27:49.616 --> 00:27:50.838]  And there's two ways to look at that.
[00:27:51.584 --> 00:27:54.227]  You can say they were right on it, trying to stop it.
[00:27:54.227 --> 00:27:56.709]  They had intel and they tried to save us.
[00:27:56.709 --> 00:27:59.472]  Of course, they pulled back right before the bombing happened.
[00:27:59.472 --> 00:28:10.543]  Or you can look at it as they were there using the drill as the cover in case some other agency or group stopped them, which is what they use the NSA for, is to make sure their false flags and other things don't get caught.
[00:28:10.543 --> 00:28:13.566]  And now that our own Dan Bodondi, in two different press conferences,
[00:28:14.127 --> 00:28:16.549]  With the police chief, the mayor, and the governor.
[00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:27.219]  Our own East Coast reporter Dan Bodondi made national news just asking real questions about, hey, now there's the Huffington Post, Boston Marathon bombing brings out conspiracy theories.
[00:28:27.219 --> 00:28:34.185]  That means people that are willing to go, hey, there was a drill, and the police say, no, there wasn't a drill.
[00:28:35.287 --> 00:28:38.048]  The police chief says there was no drill.
[00:28:38.048 --> 00:28:40.189]  The governor says there was no drill.
[00:28:40.189 --> 00:28:44.430]  And the Madandi goes up to the police after the press conference and says, was there a drill?
[00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.891]  And they say, no, no drill.
[00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:48.372]  So they're telling witnesses.
[00:28:48.372 --> 00:28:51.133]  There's a whole bunch of witnesses in local news.
[00:28:51.133 --> 00:28:54.934]  National News isn't picking it up unless they say it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:28:54.934 --> 00:28:58.155]  They just pointed us and go, look at these weirdos bringing this up.
[00:28:58.155 --> 00:28:58.956]  When we were there,
[00:29:00.066 --> 00:29:07.789]  But Donnie was there with the Boston Globe going, they say there was a drill, and other witnesses on News 15 are saying there's a drill.
[00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:08.969]  What were the drills for?
[00:29:08.969 --> 00:29:12.471]  And they're like, nope, nope, that didn't happen.
[00:29:12.471 --> 00:29:13.971]  It's just like with Dorner.
[00:29:13.971 --> 00:29:16.512]  We're gonna burn this down, burn that mother-effer down.
[00:29:16.512 --> 00:29:18.293]  Bring fire, we've got the fire.
[00:29:18.293 --> 00:29:20.073]  Place the fire, the fire is lit.
[00:29:20.073 --> 00:29:21.814]  The building is burning down.
[00:29:21.814 --> 00:29:23.235]  Good job, it's burned down.
[00:29:23.235 --> 00:29:24.255]  We killed that mother.
[00:29:24.255 --> 00:29:29.017]  They're like, hey, conspiracy theorists, that doesn't mean what you think it said.
[00:29:29.924 --> 00:29:33.387]  Burn that mother effer down doesn't mean burn that mother effer down.
[00:29:33.387 --> 00:29:36.230]  And now we're like, hey, what were the drills?
[00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.091]  That's what any real journalist would ask.
[00:29:38.091 --> 00:29:38.552]  What happened?
[00:29:38.552 --> 00:29:39.953]  They're like, no, no, there was no drills.
[00:29:39.953 --> 00:29:40.533]  There was no drills.
[00:29:40.533 --> 00:29:42.415]  So see, they're covering up.
[00:29:42.415 --> 00:29:45.978]  Folks, they're as guilty as a pig and you know what?
[00:29:45.978 --> 00:29:48.821]  OK, they are as guilty as a pig and you know what?
[00:29:48.821 --> 00:29:50.202]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.202 --> 00:29:51.603]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.603 --> 00:29:54.125]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.845 --> 00:30:03.867]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:30:03.867 --> 00:30:08.870]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:16.055]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:30:16.175 --> 00:30:21.821]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:25.845]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:30:25.845 --> 00:30:30.570]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:35.796]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:30:36.036 --> 00:30:39.277]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.

[00:30:46.538 --> 00:30:49.419]  Hand crank shortwave AM FM radios.

[00:31:04.564 --> 00:31:10.628]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:31:10.628 --> 00:31:14.511]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[00:32:10.906 --> 00:32:17.028]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.

[00:33:02.948 --> 00:33:08.954]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:08.954 --> 00:33:11.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:27.671 --> 00:33:31.717]  My friends, we're going to open the phones up in the second hour.
[00:33:31.717 --> 00:33:38.106]  And then we've got Joel Skousen popping in, we've got Doug Hagman coming on, and we've got
[00:33:39.875 --> 00:33:47.161]  The head of Oath Keepers, Stuart Rhodes, who's on his way to Boston for the April 19th commemorations there with Oath Keepers.
[00:33:47.161 --> 00:33:49.963]  We're going to be getting to all of that today with those guests popping in.
[00:33:49.963 --> 00:33:55.207]  In fact, I'll open the phones up now and get to some of them by the next segment if I'm able to get to all these clips.
[00:33:55.207 --> 00:33:56.989]  I want to get your take on what you're witnessing.
[00:33:56.989 --> 00:33:58.310]  You know, let me do this.
[00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.531]  I want to hear from police.
[00:34:01.311 --> 00:34:07.073]  Police, who've heard me on the air, say they'd have these type of events and blame it on Patriot groups.
[00:34:07.073 --> 00:34:14.196]  And even if they end up going with a Middle Eastern group, because there's a low probability it could be a real terror group from the Middle East, that some of that does happen.
[00:34:14.196 --> 00:34:17.837]  Usually it's provocateured, allowed to happen, sometimes staged.
[00:34:17.837 --> 00:34:20.698]  We know they're going to use the crisis to take our liberties.
[00:34:20.698 --> 00:34:21.658]  But it could be that.
[00:34:21.658 --> 00:34:25.620]  But the media certainly has tried to go with
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:35.127]  Nine out of ten times, I mean I've been immersed in it, I know you have been as well, all the channels, all the news, that it's a Tea Party Patriot on Tax Day that did this.
[00:34:35.127 --> 00:34:38.030]  We're going to play some clips of that in a moment.
[00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:46.116]  Now, did Salon, Media Matters, all these other White House connected groups, did they come out and go, wow, Alex Jones is right?
[00:34:46.116 --> 00:34:49.779]  No, they said I was wrong to say we'd be blamed, but went on to blame us.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:35:02.149]  And again, that's called Jim Jones-level cultism by these authoritarians that like to basically pose as liberals.
[00:35:02.149 --> 00:35:07.493]  Now, Rush Limbaugh came out, it turns out, and said that they'd probably blame us after he went off air yesterday.
[00:35:07.493 --> 00:35:09.494]  A bunch of... Michael Savage talked about it.
[00:35:09.494 --> 00:35:10.375]  Others did.
[00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:10.855]  One guy...
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.584]  Came out and immediately said I was wrong, and that was Glenn Beck.
[00:35:15.584 --> 00:35:23.533]  While having articles, we're going to show this to TV viewers, and I'm going to mention the headlines to radio listeners, saying they're going to blame the right wing, but I was bad to say it though.
[00:35:24.315 --> 00:35:26.277]  No, no, I was bad to say at first.
[00:35:26.277 --> 00:35:31.123]  You see, I was supposed to sit there all cowardly and I'm not supposed to speculate.
[00:35:31.123 --> 00:35:40.414]  I'm supposed to wait till the known lying federal government who ran fast and furious and other false flags they've been caught doing that killed thousands of people.
[00:35:40.414 --> 00:35:43.778]  You don't see them personalizing each one of those dead like they're doing these dead.
[00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.911]  I mean, they are just using this.
[00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:54.075]  And that's how you know when they're ready, when they script it, the way the whole thing's scripted, the crescendo of media coverage.
[00:35:54.075 --> 00:35:58.378]  And then you've got a drill from the start to the finish.
[00:35:58.378 --> 00:36:11.505]  Oh, and I forgot, Rob News' brother-in-law, who he argues with on a weekly basis about the New World Order and stuff, who is in military intelligence, pretty high level.
[00:36:11.505 --> 00:36:13.406]  He's married to the guy's sister.
[00:36:15.127 --> 00:36:16.748]  He runs for the team army.
[00:36:16.748 --> 00:36:23.413]  He was in the official team army marathon truck that sometimes wins.
[00:36:23.413 --> 00:36:24.914]  Dew's been on vacation with him.
[00:36:24.914 --> 00:36:33.259]  He gets up at 3am, runs 20 miles and is back in the early afternoon ready for lunch.
[00:36:33.259 --> 00:36:35.941]  And the point is that what he heard from his
[00:36:36.929 --> 00:36:39.492]  Wife who talked to him was, yeah, it's weird.
[00:36:39.492 --> 00:36:40.874]  I'm going to the hospital now.
[00:36:40.874 --> 00:36:46.121]  They pulled me out and said I was showing signs of dehydration right before the end of the marathon.
[00:36:46.121 --> 00:36:48.364]  Oh, let's get Team Army.
[00:36:48.364 --> 00:36:51.748]  By the way, we're going to find out because now they won't talk to us.
[00:36:51.748 --> 00:36:52.910]  I'm sure the word went out.
[00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.011]  I should have waited later.
[00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:55.013]  I just got in the heat of the moment.
[00:36:56.323 --> 00:36:57.864]  You know, I was like blabbing about it on air.
[00:36:57.864 --> 00:36:59.966]  I should have before they figured it out and shut it down.
[00:36:59.966 --> 00:37:05.250]  If he never talks to Rob again, Rob Doo, we'll really know the fix was in.
[00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:12.136]  But if they pulled more members of Team Army, because there was a whole, quote, large truck of Army runners.
[00:37:12.136 --> 00:37:15.279]  You've seen them on the news, you know, wearing the Army shirt.
[00:37:15.279 --> 00:37:15.939]  Hey, we're the Army.
[00:37:15.939 --> 00:37:18.081]  We win the marathon.
[00:37:18.081 --> 00:37:19.102]  And it's just bizarre.
[00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:30.534]  Absolutely bizarre, small world, because Rob Doo was also part-time in a band that Joe Stack was in, who reportedly flew his plane to the IRS building in Austin.
[00:37:30.534 --> 00:37:35.397]  That's why the footage we released ended up being on the National News of Joe Stack playing the guitar.
[00:37:35.397 --> 00:37:42.220]  And he was not even into Patriot right-wing stuff when Doo knew him a decade ago.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.201]  He was just a real quiet guy, a really good guitar player, who never talked.
[00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:47.222]  Didn't talk very much.
[00:37:48.022 --> 00:37:52.705]  Always showed up on time, always did a great job, and IRS took his house, ruined his life.
[00:37:52.705 --> 00:37:55.187]  Joe Stack might have been a real deal.
[00:37:55.187 --> 00:37:56.268]  I mean, you never know.
[00:37:56.268 --> 00:38:00.851]  And that's why there are some real deals.
[00:38:00.851 --> 00:38:03.533]  I mean, there is a chance, and I said this yesterday,
[00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:07.731]  That this could be a real deal.
[00:38:07.731 --> 00:38:11.173]  But you look at the media build-up, you look at the timing, you look at the demonization.
[00:38:11.173 --> 00:38:18.818]  You have the news saying right-wingers will attack sports stadiums and malls and mass shootings and bombings and police.
[00:38:18.818 --> 00:38:20.860]  There will be improvised explosive devices.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.461]  Ex-military will bomb every department in America.
[00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:25.043]  They've been saying that for four years.
[00:38:25.043 --> 00:38:26.403]  We're like, that's ridiculous.
[00:38:26.403 --> 00:38:26.684]  Unless...
[00:38:27.779 --> 00:38:29.140]  They know something's going to happen.
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:33.945]  If somebody kept saying, somebody's going to burn down the church, and everybody's in the church of like 200.
[00:38:33.945 --> 00:38:35.607]  These have been real cases.
[00:38:35.607 --> 00:38:37.008]  Why do you keep saying that, Bob?
[00:38:37.008 --> 00:38:37.409]  I don't know.
[00:38:37.409 --> 00:38:38.390]  Somebody's going to burn it down.
[00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.131]  We should have insurance.
[00:38:40.131 --> 00:38:42.154]  Then the church burns down the next week.
[00:38:42.154 --> 00:38:44.236]  Who's the first person the cops go and talk to?
[00:38:45.635 --> 00:38:49.357]  Bob, who said somebody might burn down the church.
[00:38:49.357 --> 00:38:59.682]  I mean, this is 101 criminology that you've got the White House going, right-winger libertarians, anti-Obama, pro-gun people, are gonna blow stuff up any minute.
[00:38:59.682 --> 00:39:01.943]  Get ready, they're gonna hurt our children.
[00:39:01.943 --> 00:39:08.807]  They're the new terror threat, bigger threat than Al-Qaeda, who the government's giving Libya and Syria, and giving heat-seeking missiles in Benghazi.
[00:39:09.758 --> 00:39:13.840]  I mean, this is no-brainer stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.081]  No-brainer.
[00:39:16.081 --> 00:39:17.482]  So here's the number for police.
[00:39:17.482 --> 00:39:19.243]  I want to get your take on this.
[00:39:19.243 --> 00:39:21.624]  800, police only, or military.
[00:39:21.624 --> 00:39:23.085]  We're currently active duty.
[00:39:23.085 --> 00:39:23.425]  800-259-9231.
[00:39:23.425 --> 00:39:23.565]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:39:23.565 --> 00:39:25.466]  But as God is my witness, dude turned white.
[00:39:25.466 --> 00:39:27.808]  We were in the war room in there and he goes, he's talking to his wife.
[00:39:27.808 --> 00:39:29.308]  He talked to her brother.
[00:39:37.895 --> 00:39:41.224]  Who's in Army Intelligence, who Duke has arguments with.
[00:39:41.224 --> 00:39:42.868]  He's like an officer.
[00:39:42.868 --> 00:39:43.931]  And he goes, oh my God.
[00:39:45.509 --> 00:39:53.332]  My brother-in-law was running the marathon and was there at the end when the bombing happened, but they pulled him out right before.
[00:39:53.332 --> 00:39:54.633]  And I go, you gotta come on here right now.
[00:39:54.633 --> 00:40:00.275]  So literally, the break-ins from a video we were playing, I walk him in and I go, your brother was running security with the 400 troops?
[00:40:00.275 --> 00:40:02.016]  He goes, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:02.016 --> 00:40:03.276]  He was running it.
[00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:04.637]  And then you heard the story.
[00:40:04.637 --> 00:40:11.119]  I mean, that was like, he hung the phone up, turned white, said, I can't handle this anymore.
[00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:12.920]  Walks in here on air.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.541]  And I mean, this is like a movie, folks.
[00:40:18.175 --> 00:40:20.275]  This is like a movie, what's going on.
[00:40:20.275 --> 00:40:42.960]  And then of course there's a drill, and then we send Dan Bodondi to two different press conferences to ask about drills, and they say there are no drills, there is nothing happening, and then we're conspiracy theorists for saying it, when it's in two local newspapers, Boston Globe, one other here in my stack, and Local 15 TV.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.300]  What is that, an NBC affiliate?
[00:40:47.876 --> 00:40:52.260]  So, so, and we're going to play that clip for you.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.121]  The full newscast is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:40:54.121 --> 00:40:55.903]  It's also up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:40:55.903 --> 00:40:59.045]  But do you understand the frustration of this?
[00:40:59.045 --> 00:41:00.006]  I mean, I study.
[00:41:00.006 --> 00:41:00.987]  This is what I do.
[00:41:00.987 --> 00:41:03.990]  I'm a leading expert.
[00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:07.372]  You know, they've had university books written in England and the United States.
[00:41:07.372 --> 00:41:09.975]  They have university classes on what I cover.
[00:41:10.745 --> 00:41:15.246]  They've got top, I'm not bragging, I mean no one else seems to study this except the people that are doing it.
[00:41:15.246 --> 00:41:30.151]  And I sit here like a private detective, watching this, studying this, interviewing, you know, former Italian presidents and former, you know, number three in the Japanese government and former, you know, European Union officials who were, who were in the, the former head of the,
[00:41:30.931 --> 00:41:39.564]  The former German defense minister, Andres von Bulow, I want to get him back on, wrote the book, CIA Stage 9-11, and he was in the meetings.
[00:41:39.564 --> 00:41:41.046]  I mean, he's high level.
[00:41:41.046 --> 00:41:42.448]  It's a fact they were involved.
[00:41:46.556 --> 00:41:49.778]  I mean, I'm fully immersed in this, okay?
[00:41:49.778 --> 00:41:55.121]  And sure, when you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail, but I don't go with that mindset.
[00:41:55.121 --> 00:42:08.209]  I'm actually looking at this, hoping this, I'm sad it happened, but hoping it's a real grassroots deal, because then it's not the government doing it, because that's a hundred times worse, folks.
[00:42:08.209 --> 00:42:11.711]  We try to prove that it's an organic operation.
[00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:12.271]  Joe Stack,
[00:42:14.668 --> 00:42:17.549]  Sixty percent chance he probably did it.
[00:42:17.549 --> 00:42:28.671]  Because they just ruined his life, took everything he had, and he just flipped out and said, you're getting nothing, I'm burning down the house, and I'm coming after you.
[00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:36.573]  Now, there was a lot of bizarre Defense Department connections to where he had his plane and stuff, but look, all I know is, they used this to get our liberties.
[00:42:37.754 --> 00:42:44.721]  So, there was a drill from start to finish, and they don't want to talk about it, and they're calling it a conspiracy theory.
[00:42:44.721 --> 00:42:47.103]  Just like they said, the first day they ignored it.
[00:42:47.103 --> 00:42:49.165]  I mean, we're there watching it.
[00:42:49.165 --> 00:42:57.293]  As they start surrounding him, I shoot a YouTube video, upload it, time-stamped, and say they're going to probably burn him down by standard operating procedure.
[00:42:57.293 --> 00:42:58.474]  An hour later, they burn him down.
[00:42:58.954 --> 00:43:03.256]  Then the audio all gets recorded of six different groups saying we're going to burn him down.
[00:43:03.256 --> 00:43:05.037]  Then they say you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:43:05.037 --> 00:43:06.578]  How dare you, Alex Jones?
[00:43:06.578 --> 00:43:09.539]  They said that, but it doesn't mean that.
[00:43:09.539 --> 00:43:13.801]  Some media said they just didn't say that, talking to you like you're stupid.
[00:43:15.342 --> 00:43:15.402]  259-9231.
[00:43:15.402 --> 00:43:22.287]  We're going to go to phone calls after I play these clips, but let's first go to Dan Bodondi.
[00:43:22.287 --> 00:43:25.609]  There's two different press conferences in the evening and then late at night.
[00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:26.710]  This became national news.
[00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:33.055]  They shut the press conference down with the governor when he got the first question in and wouldn't shut up about false flags.
[00:43:33.795 --> 00:43:35.796]  And he says, no, there was no false flag.
[00:43:35.796 --> 00:43:38.737]  And the other press conference, he says, were there drills?
[00:43:38.737 --> 00:43:40.738]  What was happening with the exercise?
[00:43:40.738 --> 00:43:42.499]  And they just said, we had no prior knowledge.
[00:43:42.499 --> 00:43:44.100]  There was no exercise.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.821]  So there was an exercise.
[00:43:46.821 --> 00:43:48.342]  That's in the Boston Globe.
[00:43:48.342 --> 00:43:49.942]  That's in the other local paper.
[00:43:49.942 --> 00:43:52.684]  And it's in News 15, but buried.
[00:43:52.684 --> 00:43:54.785]  And there's witnesses all over the place.
[00:43:54.785 --> 00:43:59.187]  And Rob Dew's brother-in-law, they come up and go, oh, you need to go to the hospital.
[00:43:59.907 --> 00:44:00.708]  And he's like, why?
[00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:02.289]  Well, we just think you're sick.
[00:44:02.289 --> 00:44:10.393]  They let you urinate on yourself, vomit, crawl across the finish line, but they pull him out, and then minutes later there's a bombing.
[00:44:10.393 --> 00:44:11.194]  At the finish line!
[00:44:12.188 --> 00:44:13.249]  Okay?
[00:44:13.249 --> 00:44:14.530]  And there's 400 troops there.
[00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.031]  The image of troops and the wreckage.
[00:44:16.031 --> 00:44:17.272]  We're being acclimated to all this.
[00:44:17.272 --> 00:44:19.934]  Now they're saying troops are going to be everywhere.
[00:44:19.934 --> 00:44:22.956]  I've always told you, don't be part of drills.
[00:44:22.956 --> 00:44:24.838]  Because most of the time it isn't a staged attack.
[00:44:24.838 --> 00:44:27.219]  But when there is an attack, it's a drill.
[00:44:27.219 --> 00:44:28.881]  It's always a drill.
[00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:30.342]  Because when they get caught with the bombs...
[00:44:31.937 --> 00:44:39.222]  They always, this happened before, they always say, and Gladio, the Russians have been caught, NATO's been caught, they say, oh, I'm part of a drill.
[00:44:39.222 --> 00:44:42.925]  Because 99% of the police aren't part of it.
[00:44:42.925 --> 00:44:58.437]  It was a drill on 7-7, where they told the young Muslims, be part of a drill for the UK, you're good liberal school teacher Muslims, and they blew them up, folks, on the train and on the bus, and one guy figured it out and was running, and they executed him in Canary Wharf.
[00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:02.118]  And then that was taken out of the newspaper with a D-notice.
[00:45:02.118 --> 00:45:05.820]  A federal emergency notice had that removed.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:14.142]  Witnesses saw them, they gunned down several guys, chased them down and gunned them down, you know, right there in front of the tourist district.
[00:45:14.142 --> 00:45:15.403]  Because they figured out what happened.
[00:45:17.543 --> 00:45:20.066]  And I'm telling you, do not be part of a drill.
[00:45:20.066 --> 00:45:24.110]  If you're police, if you're military, they're getting ready to say military or terrorist.
[00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:28.594]  All they do is tell military, intelligence has been sheep dipped into domestic operations.
[00:45:28.594 --> 00:45:33.800]  Hey, you're now going to go be part of this drill, carry this and simulate being a terrorist.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.582]  And most of the time they're not going to do it.
[00:45:35.582 --> 00:45:39.466]  But let me tell you, one out of 100 drills or so, they're going to blow it up.
[00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:56.200]  Are they going to tell you, leave it, and then you're going to get arrested, you're going to get drugged up, you're going to get tortured, you're going to get electroshock therapied, until you go before the military tribunal and say that you bombed the Sears Tower, or you bombed the mall, or you bombed the school.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:04.646]  I'm going to tell you, it's just like Arlington Road, the professor's trying to stop it, and they trick him to be on the news, and then run into the parking garage when it goes off.
[00:46:05.816 --> 00:46:09.499]  I mean, they're telling you how they do it right there, okay?
[00:46:09.499 --> 00:46:10.740]  I'm getting chills.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.383]  And I told you this was going to happen yesterday before it happened!
[00:46:14.383 --> 00:46:17.185]  Let's go to Dan Badondi at one of the press conferences.
[00:46:17.185 --> 00:46:18.567]  This is confronting the governor.
[00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:19.007]  Here it is.
[00:46:19.007 --> 00:46:20.168]  Did you take any questions?
[00:46:20.168 --> 00:46:20.268]  No.
[00:46:32.861 --> 00:46:34.943]  Next question.
[00:46:34.943 --> 00:46:37.705]  The medical people are compiling that as we speak.
[00:46:37.705 --> 00:46:39.566]  Main point of focus right now.
[00:46:49.193 --> 00:46:52.174]  We're actually working very closely with the families right now.
[00:46:52.174 --> 00:46:54.095]  We're going through those right now.
[00:47:08.019 --> 00:47:13.124]  And that was the initial video we got off Fox News.
[00:47:13.124 --> 00:47:17.248]  I actually, driving home last night, heard local news playing clips from the press conference.
[00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:18.369]  It was crystal clear.
[00:47:18.369 --> 00:47:19.971]  And Badandi was there with his mic.
[00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:33.602]  flagged InfoWars up on the podium.
[00:47:33.602 --> 00:47:37.023]  As soon as he can get that uploaded to YouTube, we'll have better quality for you.
[00:47:37.023 --> 00:47:40.704]  But that totally flipped out the media and it's called conspiracy theory.
[00:47:40.704 --> 00:47:48.247]  Now here's Badandi earlier talking to the governor and commissioner as well, asking about the bombing and drills.
[00:47:48.247 --> 00:47:48.807]  Here's that clip.
[00:47:51.493 --> 00:47:56.136]  Hey guys, Leanne McAdoo here at the Austin, Texas InfoWars News Center.
[00:47:56.136 --> 00:48:01.740]  Our East Coast reporter Dan Badondi is on the scene and he was able to get in this question at the news conference.
[00:48:02.239 --> 00:48:04.100]  And we are looking at all of that right now.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.361]  That's one of the investigative steps that we're taking.
[00:48:06.361 --> 00:48:07.982]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence.
[00:48:07.982 --> 00:48:11.264]  We certainly increased posture around a big event like this.
[00:48:11.264 --> 00:48:13.946]  All of those things happened in preparation for this event.
[00:48:13.946 --> 00:48:17.608]  But there was no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen.
[00:48:32.216 --> 00:48:34.819]  Now we've got that story on our infoworks.com.
[00:48:50.233 --> 00:48:52.935]  You didn't know that?
[00:48:52.935 --> 00:48:55.956]  So, we're going to be going over all of this now.
[00:48:55.956 --> 00:48:57.317]  Now, here's the coach.
[00:48:57.317 --> 00:48:58.278]  This is the shorter clip.
[00:48:58.278 --> 00:49:00.599]  The full clip's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:00.599 --> 00:49:03.200]  DrudgeReport.com also has it.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.523]  UM coach, bomb sniffing dogs, spotters on roofs before explosions.
[00:49:07.523 --> 00:49:14.287]  And then, in the very area, they kept making announcements to the participants, do not worry, it's just a training exercise, kind of like 9-11.
[00:49:14.287 --> 00:49:15.788]  Stay at your desk, everything's fine.
[00:49:16.408 --> 00:49:16.668]  Or 7C.
[00:49:16.668 --> 00:49:19.290]  You know, just over and over again, the Aurora shooting.
[00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:19.830]  It's fine.
[00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.311]  It's just a drill.
[00:49:21.311 --> 00:49:24.794]  Let's go ahead and now go to that clip.
[00:49:25.768 --> 00:49:27.930]  at the start line this morning.
[00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:38.077]  They had, um, bomb spotters on the roof of the building, and they had bomb-sniffing dogs coming up and down at the start line, and Melanie said there was bomb-sniffing dogs at the finish line.
[00:49:38.077 --> 00:49:44.642]  But they kept making announcements saying to the participants, do not worry, this is just a training exercise.
[00:49:44.642 --> 00:49:47.904]  Well, evidently I don't believe they were just having a training exercise.
[00:49:47.904 --> 00:49:51.207]  I think they must have known, they must have had some kind of threat or suspicion pulled in.
[00:49:52.236 --> 00:49:53.217]  No kidding.
[00:49:53.217 --> 00:49:55.620]  And again, they're lying about that.
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:56.842]  That is undoubted.
[00:49:56.842 --> 00:49:58.724]  And again, we're breaking the real news.
[00:49:58.724 --> 00:50:00.907]  We're forcing the real issues out in the open.
[00:50:00.907 --> 00:50:02.368]  We're engaged in real journalism.
[00:50:02.368 --> 00:50:03.850]  So I salute Dan Bodondi.
[00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.495]  At both press conferences, he got the first questions down.
[00:50:07.495 --> 00:50:09.157]  And they just shut the press conferences down.
[00:50:10.469 --> 00:50:12.290]  I mean, they were going to grandstand for an hour.
[00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:12.930]  You know they were.
[00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:14.871]  And the press will have more questions.
[00:50:14.871 --> 00:50:17.532]  But Madandi was there going, you were running a drill.
[00:50:17.532 --> 00:50:18.732]  You were running a drill.
[00:50:18.732 --> 00:50:21.073]  Boston Globe, you were running a drill.
[00:50:21.073 --> 00:50:22.014]  You were running a drill.
[00:50:22.014 --> 00:50:26.535]  And the governor looked like he was about to have a heart attack and looked so angry.
[00:50:26.535 --> 00:50:30.837]  And the media's like, the governor was angry that such stupid questions would be asked.
[00:50:30.837 --> 00:50:32.358]  Of course there was no drill.
[00:50:32.358 --> 00:50:34.338]  In fact, it's the media that denies it for them.
[00:50:34.338 --> 00:50:35.479]  There was no drill.
[00:50:35.479 --> 00:50:36.679]  There were no police dogs.
[00:50:36.679 --> 00:50:37.320]  There were nothing.
[00:50:39.272 --> 00:50:40.873]  Everything's fine.
[00:50:40.873 --> 00:51:00.305]  Now, up on InfoWars.com, The Family Guy, and this aired Sunday, first aired back in March, where the Boston Marathon is bombed with not one, but two bombs, by The Family Guy, the Tea Party Guy, at the Boston Marathon, at the finish, with two bombs.
[00:51:01.457 --> 00:51:04.638]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:51:04.638 --> 00:51:08.019]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:51:08.019 --> 00:51:11.000]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?

[00:53:51.884 --> 00:53:52.465]  Terragonics.
[00:53:52.465 --> 00:53:53.706]  Life's getting better!
[00:54:04.778 --> 00:54:06.719]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:54:06.719 --> 00:54:09.340]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:14.002]  We have Tom, who's a police officer, he says, in Iowa.
[00:54:14.002 --> 00:54:18.164]  Ben, who says he was IDF counter-terror, that's Israeli Defense Force.
[00:54:18.164 --> 00:54:21.066]  And Anthony, Oregon, who's the Army.
[00:54:21.066 --> 00:54:23.627]  And I want to get your take into the bottom of the next hour.
[00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:27.989]  Then Joel Skousen, who is a real terrorism expert, in my view.
[00:54:27.989 --> 00:54:29.010]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:33.212]  Doug Hagman as well, who was telling me off-air and on-air Monday, it's imminent.
[00:54:33.992 --> 00:54:36.495]  And then I got to talk to one of his federal sources.
[00:54:36.495 --> 00:54:37.796]  And by the way, I have federal sources.
[00:54:37.796 --> 00:54:38.837]  A lot of people find that hard to believe.
[00:54:38.837 --> 00:54:45.563]  I know the federal government's full of people that don't like what's happening, and there's really no discipline up there right now.
[00:54:45.563 --> 00:54:53.830]  That's why so much of this can come out, because the rest of the Secret Service and people are off with hookers doing drugs, and then the good guys are sitting there just not knowing what to do.
[00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:56.673]  That's why they're prosecuting whistleblowers, trying to scare people now.
[00:54:57.775 --> 00:55:00.318]  And then Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers is going to be popping in.
[00:55:00.318 --> 00:55:02.059]  It's a jam-packed transmission.
[00:55:02.059 --> 00:55:07.724]  We have free video feeds and audio feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash listen.
[00:55:07.724 --> 00:55:13.089]  And even if you're watching right now, post it to your Facebook, your Twitter, we'll retweet out there.
[00:55:13.089 --> 00:55:15.792]  But Family Guy, to be specific, and I'm going to your calls.
[00:55:17.324 --> 00:55:24.208]  In one episode, he runs over people at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, and then he detonates two bombs.
[00:55:24.208 --> 00:55:27.289]  So that's the clip that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:27.289 --> 00:55:35.293]  And my issue is, Doug Hagman of the X-Files came to me, and he said, you know that episode where the government flies a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center?
[00:55:35.293 --> 00:55:38.295]  A criminal element to basically set up a police state?
[00:55:38.295 --> 00:55:42.417]  The CIA planted that story on us and asked us to put that in six months before 9-11.
[00:55:44.581 --> 00:55:47.763]  I mean, it's just incredible where they're going to blame Afghanistan for it and stuff.
[00:55:47.763 --> 00:55:48.024]  Why?
[00:55:48.024 --> 00:55:49.745]  I mean, is it coincidence?
[00:55:49.745 --> 00:55:52.406]  That's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:55:52.406 --> 00:55:54.668]  But let's go to, who's up first here?
[00:55:54.668 --> 00:55:55.789]  Who's been holding the longest?
[00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:59.691]  Let's go to Ben in Mass, who says he's been with the IDF counterterrorism.
[00:55:59.691 --> 00:56:01.893]  We'll go to Tom and Anthony.
[00:56:01.893 --> 00:56:05.215]  Ben, what do you think about what's going on?
[00:56:05.215 --> 00:56:07.476]  Okay, I'm a longtime listener.
[00:56:07.476 --> 00:56:08.897]  I enjoy the show very much.
[00:56:08.897 --> 00:56:09.678]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:09.678 --> 00:56:11.479]  Thank you for calling.
[00:56:11.479 --> 00:56:14.081]  Okay, a few quick points, and I'll just let you run with it.
[00:56:15.593 --> 00:56:17.014]  Absolutely, yep.
[00:56:45.421 --> 00:56:48.864]  This may be an attack on Obama.
[00:56:48.864 --> 00:56:51.386]  There will be additional suspects at large.
[00:56:51.386 --> 00:56:55.229]  That will bring the information to really know what's up.
[00:56:55.229 --> 00:57:02.435]  Also, the Hawker Survive to Try broadcast on Thursday, April 11th may have some significance.
[00:57:02.435 --> 00:57:08.801]  There's a lot of information in that show and I think we should all listen to it.
[00:57:08.801 --> 00:57:10.322]  What did they say?
[00:57:10.322 --> 00:57:11.122]  Shadows of this?
[00:57:12.898 --> 00:57:14.319]  Yes.
[00:57:14.319 --> 00:57:16.580]  He said it's about to go wild weasel.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:21.302]  He was talking about OTMs crossing the border, the Mexican border.
[00:57:21.302 --> 00:57:36.489]  Talking about Ahmed Rodriguez and Ahmed, you know... Oh, you're talking about a real right-wing triple false flag letting real Muslims in to do a terror attack to point out that Obama's turning the whole world over to Muslims?
[00:57:36.489 --> 00:57:37.129]  Right.
[00:57:37.129 --> 00:57:38.129]  Like Benghazi.
[00:57:38.129 --> 00:57:39.610]  To destroy his credibility.
[00:57:42.372 --> 00:57:51.478]  But why would Obama order the stand down of the Joint Chiefs and CENTCOM if it was a setup of Obama on Benghazi?
[00:57:51.478 --> 00:57:55.581]  Could be that the Joint Chiefs are just incompetent and they're partying like everyone else.
[00:57:55.581 --> 00:57:58.423]  I mean, the security forces are just sucking up money.
[00:57:58.423 --> 00:58:00.605]  They don't seem to be doing anything really.
[00:58:00.605 --> 00:58:02.126]  And we're not safe.
[00:58:02.126 --> 00:58:03.307]  So that may be another
[00:58:04.431 --> 00:58:06.652]  That's the message we're supposed to receive from this event.
[00:58:06.652 --> 00:58:07.892]  Yeah, I will say that.
[00:58:07.892 --> 00:58:10.473]  Most of the giant spy network that's in the U.S.
[00:58:10.473 --> 00:58:14.654]  now go around bragging that they're spies and driving around in black SUVs.
[00:58:14.654 --> 00:58:16.635]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:58:16.635 --> 00:58:17.935]  It is totally ridiculous.
[00:58:17.935 --> 00:58:19.936]  I mean, do you have any specifics on this?
[00:58:19.936 --> 00:58:24.438]  Or is this your gut from watching this event?
[00:58:24.438 --> 00:58:31.500]  I don't, you know, I don't have intel as far as, you know... Are you currently in counter-terrorism in the Israeli Defense Force?
[00:58:32.788 --> 00:58:34.929]  No sir, I'm out of the game.
[00:58:34.929 --> 00:58:36.870]  It's also corrupt and rotten.
[00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:37.631]  Oh, I would imagine.
[00:58:37.631 --> 00:58:38.531]  Listen, thanks for calling in.
[00:58:38.531 --> 00:58:43.594]  We're going to come back with police officers.
[00:58:43.594 --> 00:58:47.576]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:55.127 --> 00:58:56.388]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:56.388 --> 00:59:00.311]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:59:00.311 --> 00:59:02.713]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.713 --> 00:59:08.417]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.417 --> 00:59:14.641]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:15.081 --> 00:59:21.064]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:21.064 --> 00:59:25.225]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:25.225 --> 00:59:29.527]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.527 --> 00:59:35.469]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.469 --> 00:59:39.031]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:39.031 --> 00:59:40.992]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.992 --> 00:59:41.432]  It's here.
[00:59:42.092 --> 00:59:53.939]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.939 --> 00:59:56.320]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.102]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.646 --> 01:00:10.470]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:12.051]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:13.612]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.612 --> 01:00:17.796]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.796 --> 01:00:24.862]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.862 --> 01:00:26.163]  Alright, we're into hour number two.
[01:00:26.163 --> 01:00:27.243]  I want to go quickly to
[01:00:28.735 --> 01:00:30.796]  Army and Police.
[01:00:30.796 --> 01:00:34.538]  That Army guy I was going to next, he just hung up 800-259-9231.
[01:00:34.538 --> 01:00:38.461]  I want to get your take on what you've seen.
[01:00:38.461 --> 01:00:43.644]  Coming up on a play clips, they're openly trying to say the Tea Party did it, as I told you they would do.
[01:00:43.644 --> 01:00:49.547]  Now that doesn't mean that's not who they won't ultimately blame, but we called it first and it's not hard to call it.
[01:00:51.646 --> 01:00:57.468]  Let's go ahead and go to Tom, who is a police officer in Iowa.
[01:00:57.468 --> 01:01:00.749]  What is your take on all this, Tom?
[01:01:00.749 --> 01:01:02.070]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:02.850]  Can you hear me?
[01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:05.031]  Yes, sir, I can.
[01:01:05.031 --> 01:01:08.292]  God bless you and the crew for risking your lives breaking the real news.
[01:01:08.292 --> 01:01:09.392]  I salute you.
[01:01:09.392 --> 01:01:10.973]  I've been in law enforcement for 25 years.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.440]  This was absolutely a false flag.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:21.362]  I'm just wondering when they're going to bring their Adam Lanza or James Holmes out and try their true serum that is a totally fake drug.
[01:01:21.362 --> 01:01:28.224]  I'm just wondering when they're going to bring out their next Patsy that is DARPA program all drugged up on Prozac, Zoloft.
[01:01:28.224 --> 01:01:33.385]  But I have a hint that this Patsy is probably going to be a Patriot Extremist.
[01:01:33.385 --> 01:01:36.446]  Never know what kind of characters they have in their programs.
[01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:41.307]  So I'm thinking they will find him, take him to jail, frame him like the Batman superhero.
[01:01:45.954 --> 01:01:47.094]  You know what, Tom?
[01:01:47.094 --> 01:01:48.995]  Your phone broke up there.
[01:01:48.995 --> 01:01:49.956]  Are you on a hands-free?
[01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:52.097]  Go ahead and try again.
[01:01:52.097 --> 01:01:54.279]  You were talking about their DARPA programs.
[01:01:54.279 --> 01:01:54.759]  Absolutely.
[01:01:54.759 --> 01:01:56.640]  Go ahead.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:06.726]  I'm just wondering when they're bringing out their next Patsy that is in a DARPA program, all drugged up on Prozac, Zoloft.
[01:02:06.726 --> 01:02:10.528]  But I have a hint that this Patsy is probably going to be a patriot extremist.
[01:02:11.405 --> 01:02:15.630]  Yeah, all they do is keep you on Halcyon, one pill they use to extract wisdom teeth to drug you up.
[01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:19.475]  You don't even know who you are when they're ripping your teeth out.
[01:02:30.689 --> 01:02:37.374]  They just give you a couple of those every day, and give you a couple extra when you go before the trial, and you'll say that you're a monkey's uncle.
[01:02:37.374 --> 01:02:39.175]  You'll say that you're King Kong.
[01:02:39.175 --> 01:02:41.276]  You'll say that you're, you know, Popeye.
[01:02:41.276 --> 01:02:49.702]  I mean, and now they're saying that they're drugging Holmes for the trial, and he's obviously bombed out of his brain.
[01:02:49.702 --> 01:02:54.145]  They could grab me and put me on it, and roll me out to say I did whatever they want!
[01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.847]  I mean, you're absolutely right.
[01:02:56.667 --> 01:03:01.110]  What about every TV show saying right-wingers are going to blow stuff up, building up?
[01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:05.512]  It's so obvious that's when they're about to do it, is when they run six months of that.
[01:03:05.512 --> 01:03:09.915]  That's how I'm, that's the biggest thing right there, is the entire propaganda operation.
[01:03:09.915 --> 01:03:12.016]  What do you say to that?
[01:03:12.016 --> 01:03:12.676]  Absolutely.
[01:03:12.676 --> 01:03:17.339]  They got Pillsbury Doughboy getting pat-downs.
[01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:18.420]  They're just trying to get us.
[01:03:19.464 --> 01:03:22.885]  Our mindset for having the army right here out on the roads.
[01:03:22.885 --> 01:03:23.766]  That's it.
[01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:27.667]  Now when you talk to other police that you know, are they starting to wake up?
[01:03:27.667 --> 01:03:29.528]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:29.528 --> 01:03:30.568]  What do you think of the state police?
[01:03:30.568 --> 01:03:31.929]  That's a feedback there.
[01:03:31.929 --> 01:03:41.032]  What do you think of the state police coming out and saying, hey, we're in meetings with the feds asking if we'll arrest Christians in mass.
[01:03:41.032 --> 01:03:43.953]  I mean, how creepy is this getting?
[01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:44.814]  It's terrible.
[01:03:46.363 --> 01:03:49.886]  Pretty soon we're just all going to be in FEMA camps.
[01:03:49.886 --> 01:03:51.027]  Well, I hope that's not the case.
[01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:51.587]  God bless you.
[01:03:51.587 --> 01:03:54.189]  By the way, I talked to Eric Muller, ManCal this morning.
[01:03:54.189 --> 01:04:00.454]  I was on via phone on his number one TV show, simulcast radio show in Chicago.
[01:04:00.454 --> 01:04:02.676]  And he said, listen, yesterday I got photos of this.
[01:04:02.676 --> 01:04:04.617]  By the way, ask Rob Due about it.
[01:04:04.617 --> 01:04:05.518]  I told him to send them there.
[01:04:05.518 --> 01:04:07.640]  I talked to his producer.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.962]  He's driving along and sees an army truck with blonde haired, blue eyed
[01:04:11.929 --> 01:04:28.436]  Dummies, bags, with bullet holes in them and dirt falling out, so he follows it to a gas station when they pull off, and he goes over and talks to the army troops, and they go, yeah, no, we were at an exercise, you know, preparing for civil unrest.
[01:04:28.436 --> 01:04:38.960]  And of course, you have the targets of five-year-olds they're shooting, you have the admission of those drills, but he said, reportedly they sent him to rob two guys, I forgot to tell you about that.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.281]  He's got photos of a truck full of the dummies.
[01:04:42.213 --> 01:04:45.274]  With, like, you know, wigs on them of, like, blonde-haired women.
[01:04:45.274 --> 01:04:48.715]  And again, my issue is it's always, quote, white Al-Qaeda.
[01:04:48.715 --> 01:04:53.317]  And now the state police have come out going, yeah, we're being asked if we go to take only the Christians' guns.
[01:04:53.317 --> 01:04:55.537]  I mean, it's like, will you arrest only the Jews?
[01:04:55.537 --> 01:04:57.618]  I mean, it's just pure tyranny.
[01:04:57.618 --> 01:04:59.919]  We're going to come back with Dave, Brian, Craig, and others.
[01:05:01.041 --> 01:05:03.002]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:05:03.002 --> 01:05:05.404]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:05:05.404 --> 01:05:10.868]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:05:10.868 --> 01:05:14.911]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:18.854]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:05:18.854 --> 01:05:20.235]  The fact is, you are.
[01:05:20.235 --> 01:05:21.255]  We all are.
[01:05:21.255 --> 01:05:23.597]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:05:23.877 --> 01:05:32.464]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:05:32.464 --> 01:05:33.845]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:05:33.845 --> 01:05:37.308]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:39.710]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:44.274]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:50.159]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:05:50.419 --> 01:05:55.745]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:06:08.487 --> 01:06:15.251]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[01:06:15.251 --> 01:06:26.196]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[01:06:26.196 --> 01:06:30.338]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:06:30.338 --> 01:06:36.522]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:06:37.262 --> 01:06:37.922]  We're good to go!
[01:07:01.187 --> 01:07:09.733]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:07:09.733 --> 01:07:13.415]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:07:13.415 --> 01:07:17.858]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:07:17.858 --> 01:07:22.922]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[01:07:22.922 --> 01:07:30.427]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus,
[01:07:31.067 --> 01:07:31.547]  I think so.
[01:08:05.885 --> 01:08:10.708]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:12.309]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:13.870]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:18.052]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.052 --> 01:08:23.195]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.195 --> 01:08:30.779]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now into our number two.
[01:08:32.518 --> 01:08:37.963]  On this 16th day of April, 2013.
[01:08:37.963 --> 01:08:43.247]  Coming up, popping in, Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief, really an expert on terrorism.
[01:08:43.247 --> 01:08:47.010]  Doug Hagman, also an expert on terrorism, Northeast Intelligence Network joining us.
[01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:53.095]  And then Stuart Rose, who's actually driving on his way to Boston right now for the Oath Keepers event on the 19th.
[01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:58.240]  The law enforcement and police military organization that swears to uphold the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.941]  That they swore an oath to.
[01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:06.246]  How incredibly evil that the media has been demonizing and claiming might be involved in terrorism with no evidence.
[01:09:06.246 --> 01:09:09.389]  He's going to be joining us as well.
[01:09:09.389 --> 01:09:12.231]  So a jam-packed two hours coming up.
[01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:16.775]  If your station just joined us, if you go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:25.956]  We have local witnesses on local TV saying they were running a drill, saying, don't worry, it's only part of a drill with bomb sniffing dogs.
[01:09:25.956 --> 01:09:37.326]  My reporter, Rob Dew, his brother-in-law, who's in Army Intelligence and part of the official Army Marathon team, was pulled out, quote, for dehydration and sent to the hospital.
[01:09:37.326 --> 01:09:38.286]  They came and pulled him out.
[01:09:38.286 --> 01:09:40.068]  He thought it was weird.
[01:09:40.068 --> 01:09:41.189]  They pulled him out.
[01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:45.052]  He was up near the front at the end of the race when the bomb went off.
[01:09:45.052 --> 01:09:46.093]  They pulled him out right before.
[01:09:47.564 --> 01:09:48.625]  Very, very bizarre.
[01:09:48.625 --> 01:09:50.465]  And they're trying to deny that even went on.
[01:09:50.465 --> 01:09:52.486]  They're trying to deny that there was a drill.
[01:09:52.486 --> 01:09:53.987]  Or that their guys were on the roofs.
[01:09:53.987 --> 01:09:56.608]  So, very suspicious.
[01:09:56.608 --> 01:10:00.470]  And I've told you, I've seen troops on the streets, TSA checkpoints where I live.
[01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:03.531]  They're saying, get ready for the Tea Party to bomb America.
[01:10:03.531 --> 01:10:05.532]  Which is the last thing the Tea Party would ever do.
[01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.692]  We know the Globalist staged Oklahoma City.
[01:10:08.692 --> 01:10:11.653]  I'm in the film A Noble Lie that we sell.
[01:10:11.653 --> 01:10:15.714]  That has police officers there talking about the Feds planting the bombs.
[01:10:15.714 --> 01:10:23.016]  Eyewitnesses to the fact that this very Attorney General, who was Deputy Attorney General at the time, was involved in a cover-up.
[01:10:23.016 --> 01:10:26.237]  This is the same Attorney General that ran Fast and Furious, that's killed thousands.
[01:10:27.113 --> 01:10:28.814]  Thousands of people.
[01:10:28.814 --> 01:10:29.354]  Some numbers are 400.
[01:10:29.354 --> 01:10:30.815]  That's the most conservative.
[01:10:30.815 --> 01:10:31.695]  Most numbers are over 2,000.
[01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:35.237]  They run false flags.
[01:10:35.237 --> 01:10:37.998]  They've given 10,000 heat-seeking missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:37.998 --> 01:10:40.900]  Saudi Arabia has been given control of Libya and Syria.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.021]  Our government and NATO are backing them.
[01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:51.104]  So they're saying on one hand it could be Al-Qaeda, and then saying Iran could be involved when Iran and Al-Qaeda are at each other's throats.
[01:10:51.104 --> 01:10:52.265]  One Shiite, one Sunni.
[01:10:53.703 --> 01:10:59.927]  And then on the other hand, I'm about to play a bunch of clips and then go to your phone calls here.
[01:10:59.927 --> 01:11:06.732]  David, Brian, Craig, all of you, John, Eddie, we're going to get to all of you.
[01:11:06.732 --> 01:11:09.274]  Police, military, I want to hear from you on this.
[01:11:09.274 --> 01:11:10.695]  We have people that were at the marathon.
[01:11:10.695 --> 01:11:11.475]  Brian was at the marathon.
[01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:13.036]  We'll go to him first.
[01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:14.717]  Eddie, friend is a Fed, has intel.
[01:11:14.717 --> 01:11:15.718]  We're going to get to all of you.
[01:11:15.718 --> 01:11:18.000]  Just have your point quickly ready.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:18.740]  But here's the deal.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:21.062]  They want to use this to turn America into a police state.
[01:11:21.897 --> 01:11:23.558]  Okay, and that's who stands to gain.
[01:11:23.558 --> 01:11:24.919]  It's bigger than Obama.
[01:11:24.919 --> 01:11:27.141]  And they've been gearing up for this to happen.
[01:11:27.141 --> 01:11:28.682]  And that's why they're the prime suspects.
[01:11:28.682 --> 01:11:30.944]  That is, somebody inside the shadow government.
[01:11:30.944 --> 01:11:35.707]  Because they've been caught doing it before, they stand to gain from it, and we've been predicting it.
[01:11:35.707 --> 01:11:45.635]  And you've seen the incredible build-up and propaganda in every drama, every sitcom, every police show, that the Tea Party is going to blow up public events.
[01:11:47.059 --> 01:11:47.921]  Just every show.
[01:11:47.921 --> 01:11:50.347]  I turn on TV, you see it.
[01:11:50.347 --> 01:11:55.378]  Shows about remaking houses inject it somehow into non-fiction shows.
[01:11:55.378 --> 01:11:56.741]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:11:57.842 --> 01:11:59.223]  Everywhere.
[01:11:59.223 --> 01:12:03.408]  It's the full demonization, and the police are being told, prepare to mass arrest Christians.
[01:12:03.408 --> 01:12:07.231]  That's in mainstream news, Fox News, and it seems crazy.
[01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:08.753]  That's all coming out now.
[01:12:08.753 --> 01:12:10.595]  Okay, are they getting ready?
[01:12:10.595 --> 01:12:16.641]  You know, peaking everybody's entrance, like a whodunit, Agatha Christie, whodunit.
[01:12:16.641 --> 01:12:17.602]  Oh, is it the Muslims?
[01:12:18.963 --> 01:12:20.786]  And notice it's Muslims right-wing.
[01:12:20.786 --> 01:12:21.808]  There's only two groups.
[01:12:21.808 --> 01:12:23.090]  It's right-wingers and Muslims.
[01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:24.872]  It's right-wingers and Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:24.872 --> 01:12:26.655]  See, now they're flipping the script.
[01:12:26.655 --> 01:12:28.478]  From Al-Qaeda to right-wingers.
[01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:30.060]  They may go ahead and say it's Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:31.104 --> 01:12:35.747]  But the point is, they're already introducing right-winger Tea Party is the same as Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:35.747 --> 01:12:37.388]  Gun owner, same as Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:37.388 --> 01:12:40.230]  Regardless, this is the psych warfare event.
[01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.151]  And I said it and was demonized.
[01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:50.777]  I said it within two minutes of it being announced yesterday in overdrive with Richard Belzer, right at 3 o'clock Central, when all this stuff happened, right at 4 Eastern.
[01:12:50.777 --> 01:12:54.580]  I said it and within minutes, salon, document cam shot, please.
[01:12:56.283 --> 01:12:56.903]  Within minutes.
[01:12:56.903 --> 01:12:58.703]  For TV viewers, you can watch this right now.
[01:12:58.703 --> 01:13:03.624]  Freestreams at Infowars.com forward slash listen.
[01:13:03.624 --> 01:13:07.125]  Okay, so here's the document, Cam, right here.
[01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:16.827]  Alex Jones, Boston explosion, a government conspiracy, and I said it will be a false flag to be blamed on the Tea Party and expand TSA reach.
[01:13:16.827 --> 01:13:17.887]  Now that was my tweets.
[01:13:17.887 --> 01:13:19.427]  That's what I said on air.
[01:13:19.427 --> 01:13:22.488]  And they love the fact that one of the people tweeting for me did a typo, so it's real funny for them.
[01:13:23.448 --> 01:13:29.113]  You try doing a radio show and tweeting, here's the blaze with absolutely no evidence Alex Jones calls Boston Marathon a false flag.
[01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:30.694]  Okay, they actually have my tweet.
[01:13:30.694 --> 01:13:33.696]  I said our hearts go out to all those that have been hurt or killed.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:39.824]  But the FBI's been behind virtually every domestic event, and I linked to the New York Times actually saying that.
[01:13:39.824 --> 01:13:40.384]  Doesn't matter.
[01:13:40.384 --> 01:13:43.586]  Then later, the Blaze came out an hour later and said they're going to blame right-wing.
[01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:49.971]  So, instead of being saying I'm right, and I'm not at odds with the Blaze, they're always doing this to me, okay?
[01:13:49.971 --> 01:13:52.753]  Now look who he's with, the George Soros Mediaite.
[01:13:52.753 --> 01:13:58.677]  Alex Jones declares Boston a false flag operation, FBI behind every terror plot.
[01:13:58.677 --> 01:14:01.519]  Now, I linked to the New York Times saying that, and I'm about to show you.
[01:14:02.179 --> 01:14:08.883]  So again, act like only I said it, and find a picture of me wearing camo that I wear maybe once a month to make it look like I'm in the militia.
[01:14:08.883 --> 01:14:09.763]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:14:09.763 --> 01:14:11.024]  Here you go.
[01:14:11.024 --> 01:14:12.605]  CNN National Security Analyst.
[01:14:12.605 --> 01:14:20.269]  Now see, I'm a kook for saying this, but one hour later, CNN National Security Analyst warns of right-wing extremists behind Boston bombings.
[01:14:20.269 --> 01:14:20.830]  Boom.
[01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:22.591]  And we have a video clip of that we're going to in a minute.
[01:14:23.331 --> 01:14:24.852]  Axelrod.
[01:14:24.852 --> 01:14:26.453]  Top White House minion.
[01:14:26.453 --> 01:14:27.494]  Operative in the media.
[01:14:27.494 --> 01:14:30.616]  Obama thinks Boston bombings could be related to tax day.
[01:14:30.616 --> 01:14:31.477]  A patriot group.
[01:14:31.477 --> 01:14:32.898]  Oh, I thought I was a kook.
[01:14:32.898 --> 01:14:34.459]  I thought I was wrong.
[01:14:34.459 --> 01:14:38.421]  Salon, Mediaite, Media Matters, Glenn Beck.
[01:14:38.421 --> 01:14:39.302]  Look at this.
[01:14:39.302 --> 01:14:41.203]  Real clear politics.
[01:14:41.203 --> 01:14:46.007]  Cenk saying, you know, it could be a right-wing guy.
[01:14:46.007 --> 01:14:47.628]  The Young Turks.
[01:14:47.628 --> 01:14:48.248]  CNN.
[01:14:48.248 --> 01:14:49.929]  Right-wing extremists to blame for explosions.
[01:14:49.929 --> 01:14:50.570]  World Net Daily.
[01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:54.654]  Boston Marathon explosion is already being blamed on the right, from the Blaze.
[01:14:54.654 --> 01:14:55.214]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:14:55.214 --> 01:14:57.838]  I thought without any proof I said that was going to happen.
[01:14:57.838 --> 01:15:03.244]  I mean, I thought I'm a bad guy.
[01:15:03.244 --> 01:15:06.969]  But then right there, again, just come on, man.
[01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:07.850]  We're in the same trench.
[01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:08.751]  Stop doing this to me.
[01:15:09.542 --> 01:15:12.104]  Boston Marathon, the initial theories.
[01:15:12.104 --> 01:15:14.827]  London Independent, they predict it's right-wing extremists.
[01:15:14.827 --> 01:15:16.188]  Boom, I'm right again.
[01:15:16.188 --> 01:15:17.610]  Irish Examiner, right-wing.
[01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:21.193]  Expert says right-wing terrorists most likely have bombed Boston.
[01:15:21.193 --> 01:15:22.674]  That's how you demonize your political opposition.
[01:15:22.674 --> 01:15:23.895]  You bomb stuff, blame it on them.
[01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:25.357]  Can't beat them fair and square?
[01:15:25.357 --> 01:15:26.258]  Stage a bomb and blame them.
[01:15:27.441 --> 01:15:31.623]  Without facts, pundits spread rumors and blame Boston bombing on the government.
[01:15:31.623 --> 01:15:32.283]  CBS News.
[01:15:32.283 --> 01:15:33.824]  What do you mean without facts?
[01:15:33.824 --> 01:15:34.745]  There's a drill.
[01:15:34.745 --> 01:15:36.966]  But you claim I claim there's a drill.
[01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:42.028]  CNN national security analyst warns of right-wing extremists behind Boston bombings.
[01:15:42.028 --> 01:15:42.889]  Town Hall.
[01:15:42.889 --> 01:15:43.769]  Boom.
[01:15:43.769 --> 01:15:44.389]  Breitbart.
[01:15:44.389 --> 01:15:46.790]  Same headline.
[01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:49.012]  Wolf Blitzer.
[01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:51.413]  Okay, so let's get it established.
[01:15:51.413 --> 01:15:53.114]  I said they would do this.
[01:15:53.114 --> 01:15:54.394]  Not because I have a big brain.
[01:15:54.394 --> 01:15:54.914]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:15:54.914 --> 01:15:55.835]  Then I'm going to your phone calls.
[01:15:56.778 --> 01:16:02.079]  And then I'm wrong when it all comes true.
[01:16:02.079 --> 01:16:06.160]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, they are setting up to have these all over the country.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.621]  If we accept this, get into the fear, the media's hyping it.
[01:16:09.621 --> 01:16:15.362]  This is the whole paradigm shift to go into total martial law to stop the Tea Party bombing everybody.
[01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:18.782]  And to get Republicans to apologize for what the Tea Party's done.
[01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:23.403]  If they blame it on the Tea Party and Republicans apologize, it's over.
[01:16:23.403 --> 01:16:26.144]  Total communist takeover run by foreign offshore banks.
[01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:33.266]  We've got to understand, they stand to gain from this, they have the history, they did Fast and Furious.
[01:16:33.266 --> 01:16:35.348]  Now let's play a few of these clips and then go to your calls.
[01:16:35.348 --> 01:16:40.112]  Here's Bill O'Reilly, last night saying, hey Patriots Day, just saying, here it is.
[01:16:40.112 --> 01:16:43.555]  So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
[01:16:43.555 --> 01:16:51.462]  Perhaps it's a coincidence, but this week marks the anniversary of attacks in Oklahoma City, Columbine, Colorado, and Virginia Tech.
[01:16:51.462 --> 01:16:53.104]  Also the Waco assault in 1993.
[01:16:55.914 --> 01:16:58.376]  Okay, so there's O'Reilly doing his job.
[01:16:58.376 --> 01:17:04.900]  BBC, here's BBC saying it, one hour after the attacks, minutes after I said it, saying they'd blame us.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:05.981]  Here's BBC.
[01:17:05.981 --> 01:17:15.207]  The other thing I think I'd say is that if this does turn out to be terrorism, don't immediately jump to conclusions about who's responsible.
[01:17:15.207 --> 01:17:15.627]  There's some
[01:17:16.768 --> 01:17:18.088]  It's more than rumour.
[01:17:18.088 --> 01:17:36.132]  It's chatter from within the intelligence services that suggests that it might not be what one's mind perhaps leaps to of Islamic radicals, but that it could be homegrown extremists who, of course, have attacked it in the past within America.
[01:17:36.132 --> 01:17:41.913]  Indeed, one recalls the Oklahoma bomb, of course, which was attributed initially to Islamic terrorists and turned out to be homegrown.
[01:17:43.086 --> 01:17:44.167]  Yes, exactly.
[01:17:44.167 --> 01:17:56.913]  And there's reports that that happened on... I'm not saying reports, because I just haven't had time to check it out, but that happened also on Patriot Day, which is today, the first Monday in April.
[01:17:56.913 --> 01:18:00.054]  So that might have a special significance.
[01:18:00.054 --> 01:18:05.057]  And we know that the Homeland Security have... Oh, thank God for Homeland Security!
[01:18:05.057 --> 01:18:07.278]  Let's never look at Homeland Security!
[01:18:08.118 --> 01:18:13.981]  I mean, security services for hundreds of years have been famous for staging their own bombings and shootings to take control.
[01:18:13.981 --> 01:18:18.503]  They're always the number one culprit, taught in mainline criminology and history books.
[01:18:18.503 --> 01:18:28.967]  But, oh, Alex Jones said, hey, they're running a drill and told people be calm before it happened, and we're pulling members of the Army running team out to protect them right before it happened.
[01:18:28.967 --> 01:18:31.768]  Oh, Alex Jones says they're going to blame the right wing, which they're doing.
[01:18:31.768 --> 01:18:32.829]  He's bad.
[01:18:32.829 --> 01:18:37.351]  Let's go to the young Turks talking about it, and then we'll go to break and come back with your calls.
[01:18:37.631 --> 01:18:38.391]  Here's the Young Turks.
[01:18:54.938 --> 01:18:58.580]  It's Patriots Day, it's the Marathon Day, it's the Kennedy Library, always up there.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:08.927]  And also, as you point out, I just forgot because I filed already that it's filing day for the federal income tax, which does cause some emotions around the country, sometimes in the wrong parts of the brain.
[01:19:08.927 --> 01:19:12.028]  Anyway, thank you, Congressman Kennedy, for joining us from Massachusetts.
[01:19:12.028 --> 01:19:13.789]  Well, Michael, tax day today.
[01:19:13.789 --> 01:19:14.190]  That came up.
[01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:14.670]  That's enough.
[01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:15.631]  Get it off there.
[01:19:15.631 --> 01:19:18.692]  And I've got more and more clips.
[01:19:18.692 --> 01:19:22.555]  And then I've got Glenn Beck saying, how dare I say they blame the right wing?
[01:19:22.555 --> 01:19:24.396]  I mean, obviously that was going to happen.
[01:19:25.932 --> 01:19:29.054]  And again, I expect it from George Soros scripts.
[01:19:29.054 --> 01:19:31.615]  And I still, Olive Branch, God bless you.
[01:19:31.615 --> 01:19:36.397]  Fine, if you think you're going to be safe with these people, because they're guaranteed going to do stuff and blame it on you, Glenn.
[01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:37.397]  They're guaranteed.
[01:19:37.397 --> 01:19:38.858]  They've already done it to me before.
[01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:41.919]  They're going to, in mass shootings, you name it, they're going to go look on a computer.
[01:19:41.919 --> 01:19:44.860]  If the person ever visited your website, they're going to blame you.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:47.822]  And I'll be there protecting you when it happens, because I'm not a scumbag.
[01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:51.994]  Okay, we're going to come back with police and military.
[01:19:51.994 --> 01:19:53.216]  Then we've got Joel Skousen.
[01:19:53.216 --> 01:19:53.737]  Stay there.
[01:19:53.737 --> 01:19:55.800]  David, John, Brian, Eddie, Craig.
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.863]  We're going to Brian, who was at the marathon.
[01:19:57.863 --> 01:19:58.504]  We come back.
[01:19:58.504 --> 01:19:59.005]  Stay with us.
[01:19:59.005 --> 01:19:59.706]  Call us straight ahead.
[01:20:01.618 --> 01:20:03.999]  You've heard about our MRE Smorgasbord.
[01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:12.223]  Now, Long Life Food Depot introduces the most unique, safe, and longest-lasting way to stash emergency food, the EatPod.
[01:20:12.223 --> 01:20:18.726]  Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps, low moisture, and low oxygen.
[01:20:18.726 --> 01:20:21.127]  If you're storing in a basement, too humid.
[01:20:21.127 --> 01:20:23.168]  Garages and attics, too hot.
[01:20:23.168 --> 01:20:27.710]  But the waterproof, double-walled, high-density polyethylene patent-pending EatPod
[01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:41.375]  is a unique rollaway food bunker that creates the perfect conditions, can be buried up to 30 feet, and can keep your survival food supply safe, secure, dry, and virtually undetectable for 25 years or more.
[01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:47.977]  Get full details on the Eatpod at eatpod.com spelled E-A-T-P-O-D dot com or call 800-601-2833.
[01:20:47.977 --> 01:20:48.217]  That's 800-601-2833.
[01:20:48.217 --> 01:20:49.958]  The Eatpod from Long Life Food Depot.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:01.001]  Since 1983, sending real food to your real future.
[01:21:01.001 --> 01:21:14.005]  For those who know the benefits of silver, for those who know the healing history of silver, and for those who want to be prepared, now there's SilverGauze, a nylon elastic wrap with silver bonded to each individual fiber.

[01:21:22.588 --> 01:21:25.749]  Spelled Silver, G-A-U-Z-E dot com.
[01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:29.750]  Silver Gauze is what your emergency kit is missing.
[01:21:30.442 --> 01:21:31.683]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:36.246]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:36.246 --> 01:21:42.050]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:45.692]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:48.414]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.414 --> 01:21:53.477]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:21:53.477 --> 01:21:53.718]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.718 --> 01:21:55.119]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.562 --> 01:22:02.464]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:06.106]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:22:06.106 --> 01:22:10.690]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:16.754]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:22:16.754 --> 01:22:27.542]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:30.605]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[01:22:30.605 --> 01:22:34.248]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:22:34.248 --> 01:22:48.981]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands.
[01:22:49.941 --> 01:23:05.050]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:08.091]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:08.091 --> 01:23:16.396]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:17.046 --> 01:23:22.611]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:22.611 --> 01:23:33.981]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:23:33.981 --> 01:23:40.988]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:41.648 --> 01:23:45.950]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:49.552]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:23:49.552 --> 01:23:52.494]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:56.816]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:23:56.816 --> 01:23:58.076]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:58.076 --> 01:23:59.117]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:12.021]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we know they're going to exploit this crisis either way.
[01:24:12.021 --> 01:24:15.022]  I have predicted it up one side, down the other.
[01:24:15.022 --> 01:24:22.445]  I believe they're going to try to blame it on domestic groups, maybe even claim domestic groups are working with Al-Qaeda, because that's been in this bizarre new script they've been putting out.
[01:24:22.445 --> 01:24:23.385]  This is all scripted.
[01:24:23.865 --> 01:24:27.566]  It's designed to target low-grade morons that are the general public, unfortunately.
[01:24:27.566 --> 01:24:30.207]  Now, I'm going to go to your phone calls now.
[01:24:30.207 --> 01:24:32.867]  Then I've got a big data dump of info coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:33.868]  We'll continue with calls.
[01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:36.088]  Dan Badani's going to be popping in.
[01:24:36.088 --> 01:24:37.989]  So is Joel Skousen.
[01:24:37.989 --> 01:24:43.030]  So is the head of Oath Keepers, Stuart Rhodes, today.
[01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:47.772]  But without further ado, Brian in mass says you were at the marathon.
[01:24:47.772 --> 01:24:48.932]  Thank you for calling in today.
[01:24:48.932 --> 01:24:51.453]  Glad you're OK, or hope you're OK.
[01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:52.333]  What can you tell us, sir?
[01:24:53.581 --> 01:24:56.143]  Well, thanks Alex for putting me on the show here today.
[01:24:56.143 --> 01:24:57.824]  I appreciate everything that you're doing.
[01:24:57.824 --> 01:24:58.944]  Thank you.
[01:24:58.944 --> 01:25:02.827]  Okay, so what I want to do is, I don't know if I have bad luck or not.
[01:25:02.827 --> 01:25:04.808]  I'm actually originally from Connecticut.
[01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:07.630]  I actually work at Newtown High School.
[01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:16.536]  I'm a coach there, but my girlfriend lives up here and she goes to BU and I decided to do the 5k run before, the day before the Boston Marathon they do.
[01:25:16.536 --> 01:25:20.238]  And it was the same exact, pretty much run down there by the finals.
[01:25:20.717 --> 01:25:27.440]  So I kind of ran down there the day before, running by all that stuff, which was kind of pretty eerie.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.402]  But where it happened, where I was, was about a mile and a half from where it ended on Beacon.
[01:25:32.402 --> 01:25:40.245]  And I didn't hear the bombs where I were, but my girlfriend's roommate was down there a little bit closer, and she heard everything.
[01:25:40.245 --> 01:25:42.626]  And it was just incredible.
[01:25:42.626 --> 01:25:48.409]  And just to relate back to the Sandy Hook thing, I've been doing a lot of research there, listening to YouTube for a while.
[01:25:49.071 --> 01:25:55.099]  Everything is just going, you know, everything's just twisted and everything's kind of just bringing itself together.
[01:25:55.099 --> 01:26:03.830]  All these false flag events are really, you know, the same feeling from Sandy Hook I'm getting here now and it was very, it was hard to sleep last night.
[01:26:04.386 --> 01:26:06.528]  Well, look, I mean, this is a global corporate empire.
[01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:09.470]  It's got to have events to keep control of the people.
[01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:13.212]  And I'm just glad they didn't kill more people to sell their police state.
[01:26:13.212 --> 01:26:15.314]  But it's not going well for them.
[01:26:15.314 --> 01:26:18.136]  Just like the underwear bomber, the government got the guy on the plane.
[01:26:18.136 --> 01:26:19.037]  We broke that here.
[01:26:19.737 --> 01:26:22.219]  Hey Alex, yeah I was just sitting here and a buddy of mine
[01:26:42.259 --> 01:26:47.085]  He's a, he has a federal job and he told me, I gotta stop by your shop.
[01:26:47.085 --> 01:26:48.706]  And I said, sure, why not?
[01:26:48.706 --> 01:26:52.491]  So he comes over here and he tells me, you know, we talk about the bombing and whatnot.
[01:26:52.491 --> 01:26:53.212]  And then he tells me.
[01:26:54.392 --> 01:26:58.615]  Okay, there's reasons I can't give you, but I feel bad if I didn't give you a warning.
[01:26:58.615 --> 01:27:01.497]  Buy as much ammo as you can.
[01:27:01.497 --> 01:27:05.179]  The only thing I can tell you is, buy as much ammo as you can.
[01:27:05.179 --> 01:27:15.646]  His friend in the Pentagon, he will not give me any critical information as to why, but he just told me, buy as much ammo as you can.
[01:27:15.646 --> 01:27:16.126]  Double it.
[01:27:16.126 --> 01:27:21.890]  I don't care if you have 21 shotguns or whatever, you double that by the end of the month.
[01:27:23.567 --> 01:27:29.250]  Wow, so you talked to your source and he said his friend at the Pentagon just said get as much ammo as you can.
[01:27:30.282 --> 01:27:31.403]  That's exactly what he said.
[01:27:31.403 --> 01:27:35.285]  And I told him, did they declare martial law in Boston?
[01:27:35.285 --> 01:27:37.326]  He said, no, they declared a state of emergency.
[01:27:37.326 --> 01:27:38.146]  Different.
[01:27:38.146 --> 01:27:40.448]  And I said, well, you know, I heard different things.
[01:27:40.448 --> 01:27:45.690]  And he said, all I'm going to tell you and all I'm authorized to tell you is the same thing I've been telling you.
[01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:48.432]  Buy more ammo.
[01:27:48.432 --> 01:27:48.992]  Absolutely.
[01:27:48.992 --> 01:27:55.376]  Look, the state police came out in Colorado last week and said, we've been told to prepare to confiscate the guns of Christians only.
[01:27:56.235 --> 01:27:58.758]  I mean, right there the whole government should be arrested.
[01:27:58.758 --> 01:28:08.491]  And then Fox News reports, yeah, the army's being told evangelicals and Catholics and other Christians are in with Al Qaeda and they're listed as extremists.
[01:28:08.491 --> 01:28:11.615]  I mean, it's an authoritarian takeover.
[01:28:12.276 --> 01:28:14.518]  And we're going to get Joel Scouser's take on this.
[01:28:14.518 --> 01:28:19.281]  You know, he's always thinking it's more down the road, but they can always move timetables up when they're behind.
[01:28:19.281 --> 01:28:27.047]  I mean, you've got all the North Korea craziness going on, the Iran craziness, and maybe they're testing us right now, but we're going to find out.
[01:28:27.047 --> 01:28:28.208]  Thank you, Eddie.
[01:28:28.208 --> 01:28:30.470]  Let's talk to Dave, who's in the Marine Corps.
[01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:33.792]  Dave, what is your take on all this?
[01:28:33.792 --> 01:28:34.493]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:28:35.623 --> 01:28:36.503]  I'm not doing too good.
[01:28:36.503 --> 01:28:37.544]  I mean, have I not been saying?
[01:28:37.544 --> 01:28:42.787]  I mean, when every show says the Tea Party's going to blow up public events, I mean, that's pre-programming.
[01:28:42.787 --> 01:28:44.788]  I mean, I've seen them do this before.
[01:28:44.788 --> 01:28:45.468]  This looks bad.
[01:28:45.468 --> 01:28:45.748]  Go ahead.
[01:28:45.748 --> 01:28:48.049]  What do you think's happening?
[01:28:48.049 --> 01:28:50.971]  I'm going to tell you exactly what's happening.
[01:28:50.971 --> 01:28:55.193]  Martial Art is coming in a couple of days.
[01:28:55.193 --> 01:29:03.397]  The next thing is, in the video, two seconds before the blast, an intel
[01:29:05.290 --> 01:29:05.690]  I don't know.
[01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:30.703]  Every historical event in 1979 leads up to what has started in January and leads up to December.
[01:29:30.703 --> 01:29:35.546]  Margaret Thatcher, she became Prime Minister in 79.
[01:29:35.546 --> 01:29:41.451]  Iran with the hostages in 1979.
[01:29:43.971 --> 01:29:50.635]  Also, uh, you do have, in 1979... Hold on, stay there, Joel Scouser's coming up, I don't want you to build a fence.
[01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:54.418]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.418 --> 01:29:57.099]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.536 --> 01:30:04.939]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:30:04.939 --> 01:30:11.003]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:30:11.003 --> 01:30:14.886]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:30:14.886 --> 01:30:16.468]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[01:30:16.468 --> 01:30:20.291]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[01:30:51.176 --> 01:30:58.202]  You aren't always at home, but SimpliSafe will stand guard, protecting your property 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:30:58.202 --> 01:31:00.345]  Again, that's GetSimpliSafe.com
[01:31:01.045 --> 01:31:02.986]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:31:02.986 --> 01:31:05.406]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:31:05.406 --> 01:31:10.868]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:31:10.868 --> 01:31:14.909]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:31:14.909 --> 01:31:18.831]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:31:18.831 --> 01:31:20.231]  The fact is, you are.
[01:31:20.231 --> 01:31:21.251]  We all are.
[01:31:21.251 --> 01:31:23.592]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:31:23.892 --> 01:31:32.460]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:33.841]  Be prepared before you need it.

[01:31:37.304 --> 01:31:39.706]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[01:31:52.057 --> 01:31:58.581]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:58.581 --> 01:32:00.462]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:32:03.067 --> 01:32:11.172]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[01:33:01.794 --> 01:33:09.382]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:40.174 --> 01:33:43.817]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:43.817 --> 01:33:44.398]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:44.398 --> 01:34:02.973]  we're here live we're now into the middle of the show in the middle of the second hour Joel Skousen who heads up World Affairs Brief and of course was a Marine Corps fighter pilot during the Vietnam era and is really an expert on geopolitical actions and activities is going to be joining us here in just a moment
[01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:11.725]  Obviously, I get so focused on big news events like this that I don't even talk about our sponsors or the different things that I'm doing.
[01:34:11.725 --> 01:34:13.969]  Remember to support InfoWars.com.
[01:34:13.969 --> 01:34:15.552]  Remember to buy the books, the t-shirts.
[01:34:16.988 --> 01:34:20.629]  With the films, the information at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:28.971]  We have the seed center up there where you can get all the very best non-GMO, non-hybrid seed varieties at the lowest cost out there.
[01:34:28.971 --> 01:34:31.172]  We're very, very extremely competitive.
[01:34:31.172 --> 01:34:35.033]  The InfoWarsSeedCenter at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:35.033 --> 01:34:37.434]  InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:34:37.434 --> 01:34:45.676]  The ProPure water filters, you can call or order them online with promo code water and save 10% off any of the ProPure or any of the water filtration systems.
[01:34:46.676 --> 01:34:52.282]  Again, that's info or store.com, the best system out there at the lowest price.
[01:34:52.282 --> 01:34:55.666]  Hands down, look at the side-by-side comparisons with the competition.
[01:34:55.666 --> 01:35:03.835]  And also don't forget we're sending out video feeds right now as well as the free audio feeds during this new
[01:35:05.356 --> 01:35:06.998]  Escalation.
[01:35:06.998 --> 01:35:07.958]  False flag event.
[01:35:07.958 --> 01:35:10.080]  The fingerprints are very clear.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.581]  We don't just jump to those conclusions.
[01:35:11.581 --> 01:35:13.423]  There were drills as usual.
[01:35:13.423 --> 01:35:14.504]  Stand downs.
[01:35:14.504 --> 01:35:17.206]  Now they're saying there weren't drills even though they're admitted.
[01:35:17.206 --> 01:35:19.708]  Army personnel being pulled out who were in the marathon.
[01:35:19.708 --> 01:35:23.251]  People we know and told, oh you're going to for a wellness check.
[01:35:23.251 --> 01:35:23.832]  I'm fine.
[01:35:23.832 --> 01:35:24.512]  No, come with us.
[01:35:25.633 --> 01:35:27.495]  We've got all that going on.
[01:35:27.495 --> 01:35:35.221]  You've got the immediate right-wingers are behind it, but they're not ever, you know, actually fighting the patsy yet, letting it grow.
[01:35:35.221 --> 01:35:36.342]  You've got all that happening.
[01:35:36.342 --> 01:35:39.845]  So we're going to get Joel Skousen's take on that in just one moment.
[01:35:39.845 --> 01:35:45.549]  But don't forget, you can go to Infowars.com forward slash listen and find the video feed, the free video feed.
[01:35:45.549 --> 01:35:52.575]  And please send that out on your email list, your Twitter, your Facebook, your friends and family, so they can get an alternative of what's happening.
[01:35:52.575 --> 01:35:53.616]  I am being demonized.
[01:35:54.659 --> 01:35:59.703]  How dare Alex Jones say that the Tea Party would be blamed?
[01:35:59.703 --> 01:36:01.585]  When, of course, they did.
[01:36:01.585 --> 01:36:07.049]  How dare Alex Jones say that there was a drill when there was a drill?
[01:36:07.049 --> 01:36:16.557]  And they had loudspeakers saying, be calm, it's no big deal, never mind, we're placing, you know, these pressure cooker bags next to you.
[01:36:16.557 --> 01:36:21.241]  It's just, they do these false flags so ham-fistedly, always the same M.O.
[01:36:21.241 --> 01:36:21.662]  with the drill.
[01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:31.089]  It looks like there weren't even probably Patsy's, though they'll probably present a drugged up Patsy very, very soon, bombed out of their mind on Halcyon and five other drugs.
[01:36:31.089 --> 01:36:34.812]  So real briefly, cut to the chase there, Dave.
[01:36:34.812 --> 01:36:40.357]  Is this something you speculate on, on the messages they like to leave calling cards, like the Ace of Spades?
[01:36:40.357 --> 01:36:44.200]  Or is this intel you're getting from your sources in the Marine Corps?
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.223]  This is intel that we get from the Marine Corps.
[01:36:49.291 --> 01:36:52.472]  This is a domestic false flag.
[01:36:52.472 --> 01:36:54.653]  It's not international.
[01:36:54.653 --> 01:36:56.614]  The building did not blow up.
[01:36:56.614 --> 01:37:01.037]  That would have been international.
[01:37:01.037 --> 01:37:02.017]  This is all domestic.
[01:37:02.017 --> 01:37:04.338]  This is the false flag.
[01:37:04.338 --> 01:37:07.740]  There is one more event that's going to take place.
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:12.703]  It's domestic and I'll send you an email.
[01:37:12.703 --> 01:37:14.404]  But I can't talk more.
[01:37:14.404 --> 01:37:15.444]  What you're being told by
[01:37:18.624 --> 01:37:20.005]  What area of the Marine Corps are you in?
[01:37:20.005 --> 01:37:23.267]  I can't tell you.
[01:37:23.267 --> 01:37:28.431]  Well, I mean, specifically though, you know sometimes they tell you guys stuff that is going to happen, but it really doesn't.
[01:37:28.431 --> 01:37:33.874]  But you're being told that within days there's going to be an event that triggers martial law?
[01:37:33.874 --> 01:37:35.075]  Yeah.
[01:37:35.075 --> 01:37:37.397]  Yeah.
[01:37:37.397 --> 01:37:41.680]  I just watched Price of Oil.
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:45.062]  Also, a certain embassy.
[01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:50.951]  Well, I noticed that gold imploded yesterday.
[01:37:50.951 --> 01:37:54.152]  The stock market went down big time and then all this started.
[01:37:54.152 --> 01:37:55.692]  Big things afoot with Iran.
[01:37:55.692 --> 01:37:57.233]  Big things afoot with North Korea.
[01:37:57.233 --> 01:37:59.273]  A very bizarre time.
[01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:00.474]  Thank you so much for the call, sir.
[01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:01.414]  God bless you.
[01:38:01.414 --> 01:38:03.435]  That caller sounds very credible.
[01:38:03.435 --> 01:38:10.657]  Government people, I've met with them and talked to them in private, get very, you know, very, very nervous about talking about anything they're being told.
[01:38:10.657 --> 01:38:14.258]  But a lot of times they're in their own echo chamber with even more propaganda.
[01:38:14.798 --> 01:38:22.486]  Now, somebody I really respect and who's got his finger on the pulse at a lot of levels is Joel Skousen, who I just introduced to World Affairs Brief.
[01:38:22.486 --> 01:38:24.488]  And I don't know his take on this yet.
[01:38:24.488 --> 01:38:27.331]  We're going to get his full take on it right now.
[01:38:27.331 --> 01:38:35.439]  But again, I'll tell you, when every drama, every cop show, every sitcom, I mean, I randomly in a hotel room turn it on and I've asked listeners about it.
[01:38:35.439 --> 01:38:37.240]  They see everything they see, every show.
[01:38:38.015 --> 01:38:45.482]  Whether it's drama, fiction, non-fiction, news, cop shows, the Tea Party is killing children and burying them in their backyard.
[01:38:45.482 --> 01:38:48.304]  They're bombing the football game.
[01:38:48.304 --> 01:38:50.906]  They're shooting police officers.
[01:38:50.906 --> 01:38:53.228]  They're mass murdering.
[01:38:53.228 --> 01:39:00.515]  It is greater demonization, which he deserved, that I saw of Hitler in 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, in Disney cartoons and stuff.
[01:39:05.699 --> 01:39:07.400]  I mean, it's to the power of 10.
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:12.484]  I mean, we are being demonized as the enemy.
[01:39:12.484 --> 01:39:17.487]  And if you know military basic propaganda, I mean, this tells you, okay, we're about to be set up.
[01:39:17.487 --> 01:39:20.349]  I mean, it's not, it's an absolute no-brainer.
[01:39:20.349 --> 01:39:22.610]  I mean, you turn on MTV, anything.
[01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:25.672]  Joel Skousen, that right there is why I said, tis the season.
[01:39:25.672 --> 01:39:29.895]  You were on two weeks ago and I said, I feel a false flag is imminent.
[01:39:29.895 --> 01:39:31.736]  And I said that yesterday before it happened.
[01:39:32.396 --> 01:39:33.237]  Imminent!
[01:39:33.237 --> 01:39:41.083]  I mean, you have the ADL sending letters to Obama saying, we warned you, we warned Clinton right before the last bombing in 95, we're telling you it's imminent.
[01:39:41.083 --> 01:39:48.029]  And that's so they can grandstand and say, see, we told you it's imminent when they were in Elohim City running the compound McVeigh was in.
[01:39:48.029 --> 01:39:51.572]  And feds that blew the whistle got arrested, like, how?
[01:39:51.572 --> 01:40:00.459]  So, I mean, just the way they grandstand publicly, red alert, and I believe, just like I said on 9-11, I believe there'll be a bio-attack now, I don't know how I knew that.
[01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:02.943]  That was the anthrax.
[01:40:02.943 --> 01:40:04.203]  And thank God the media attacked me.
[01:40:04.203 --> 01:40:05.043]  That's on record.
[01:40:05.043 --> 01:40:06.704]  Joel, I'm ranting here.
[01:40:06.704 --> 01:40:08.345]  What is your take on all this?
[01:40:08.345 --> 01:40:17.788]  I mean, not just my intel, my intellect, my spirit, my gut is just reeling off the chart and was before the show yesterday.
[01:40:17.788 --> 01:40:20.309]  Joel Skousen, I think this is just the beginning of something bigger.
[01:40:22.796 --> 01:40:28.325]  Well Alex, it has all of the hallmarks of a government false flag operation.
[01:40:28.325 --> 01:40:35.696]  The first and foremost one is they always pick high-profile events to have the maximum press coverage, the maximum impact on people.
[01:40:36.656 --> 01:40:41.861]  Whether it's attacking a federal building in the Murrah building, which was clearly a government operation.
[01:40:41.861 --> 01:40:48.588]  There were other explosive devices found around that building and the local television station took pictures of them.
[01:40:48.588 --> 01:40:51.812]  They were told to shut down those pictures and not show any of that.
[01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:56.156]  They wanted to especially point that to a right-wing terrorist, which they did.
[01:40:57.037 --> 01:41:07.262]  There were many other things about that, including eliminating the earthquake seismographs, which showing two explosions.
[01:41:07.262 --> 01:41:13.585]  They edited out the films of the various convenience stores, which went off during the explosion.
[01:41:13.585 --> 01:41:17.987]  The films would have shown shaking twice inside the building.
[01:41:17.987 --> 01:41:19.208]  They removed those.
[01:41:19.208 --> 01:41:23.089]  Sure, and FBI agents came out in the LA Times and said they'd seen the footage.
[01:41:23.089 --> 01:41:25.691]  It was McVeigh with six other guys.
[01:41:25.691 --> 01:41:26.071]  That's right.
[01:41:26.781 --> 01:41:42.292]  And so, you know, whether it's the McMurrah Building or whether it's 9-11 or even the First World Trade Center Building, these were clearly false flag operations involved with terrorists hired by the United States.
[01:41:42.292 --> 01:41:51.579]  And there was also a drill going on with airliners crashing into buildings going on on the very day that 9-11 happened.
[01:41:51.579 --> 01:41:52.620]  Explain why they do drills!
[01:41:53.649 --> 01:41:56.511]  Well, drills, first of all, have two purposes.
[01:41:56.511 --> 01:42:03.196]  One, in case there's a problem, you know, they've got cover in the sense that if they want to back out, they've got cover.
[01:42:03.196 --> 01:42:06.659]  But more importantly, they tie up resources.
[01:42:06.659 --> 01:42:14.165]  They diminish the ability of first responders in aircraft or fighter aircraft during 9-11 to respond because it was just a drill.
[01:42:15.191 --> 01:42:24.957]  And so it stopped everyone from being locked into the position of immediately responding because they were conflicted with the fact that, is this a drill or is this real?
[01:42:24.957 --> 01:42:41.506]  Yeah, that way they didn't respond to the first two, but then from what I have, refused orders by the third one and went ahead and it was recorded two AIM-9s, which I guess are sidewinders, and then of course then they wanted to cover that up, that basically Air Force people refused to follow orders to stand down.
[01:42:43.271 --> 01:42:57.755]  Well, I had a call as editor of the World Affairs Brief from a tower operator at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, and he said, you know, I personally got the order from the base commander to shut down the tower and not let any fighter aircraft take off.
[01:42:57.755 --> 01:42:59.556]  So there really were stand-down orders.
[01:43:01.634 --> 01:43:08.359]  In this case, there's a couple of other things that are telltale signs about this Boston bombing.
[01:43:08.359 --> 01:43:11.061]  And one of those is that it's a low-grade explosive.
[01:43:11.061 --> 01:43:16.345]  If you see the pictures of that, you see red and orange fire associated with the explosives.
[01:43:16.345 --> 01:43:18.527]  You don't see that with high explosives.
[01:43:18.527 --> 01:43:22.370]  It's either zero light emission or it's white, pure white.
[01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:26.491]  There is no orange or red unless it's a low-grade explosive.
[01:43:26.491 --> 01:43:33.373]  And that indicates that this is something that can be easily blamed on an amateur, somebody domestic.
[01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:36.954]  It's very difficult to get high explosives unless you're government.
[01:43:36.954 --> 01:43:42.416]  I think that they have a reason to use low-grade explosives so they can more easily pin this on amateurs.
[01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:47.411]  Or someone who would appear to be involved in the American right wing.
[01:43:47.411 --> 01:43:48.732]  I don't know how they're going to do it yet.
[01:43:48.732 --> 01:43:52.133]  They certainly haven't had anyone claim responsibility.
[01:43:52.133 --> 01:44:01.376]  And if it's a normal terrorist attack, almost always, almost always you have an organization claim the purpose.
[01:44:01.376 --> 01:44:06.277]  I mean, what's the purpose of killing a lot of innocent people if you aren't going to dramatize your cause?
[01:44:06.277 --> 01:44:07.798]  And make a demand.
[01:44:07.798 --> 01:44:08.698]  And make your demands.
[01:44:09.618 --> 01:44:14.743]  No, the demand is we're going to put TSA on the streets, sticking their hands down your pants and army everywhere.
[01:44:14.743 --> 01:44:16.806]  And I've already seen this in Austin last month.
[01:44:16.806 --> 01:44:18.747]  That's why I said they're getting close.
[01:44:18.747 --> 01:44:20.029]  I can't go to the kite festival.
[01:44:20.029 --> 01:44:21.630]  I can't go to a sporting event.
[01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:25.975]  Oh, here's the National Guard to search my bags and grab my wife.
[01:44:25.975 --> 01:44:27.817]  Now, Joel, expanding on this.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:37.006]  I'm getting chatter not just on air but off air from military sources that they were already told get ready for something this week and that bigger stuff's coming.
[01:44:37.006 --> 01:44:44.873]  Now they may just be testing them, but all the build-up, you know, well, where do you expect this to go?
[01:44:44.873 --> 01:44:55.362]  I know you don't like to speculate, but I mean just looking at how they're already saying Al-Qaeda right-wing, Al-Qaeda right-wing, even if they don't blame it on right-wing later, they're already conflating the two terms.
[01:44:56.581 --> 01:45:03.426]  Well, first of all, I don't think there's any way that you're going to hold a major mass marathon again without extreme security measures.
[01:45:03.426 --> 01:45:16.055]  In other words, it's going to justify TSA getting bigger and bodier in your face all of the time, and this is part of the reason for the shoe bombers and the various other bombers, which were fake bombers.
[01:45:16.055 --> 01:45:21.298]  There's no way that a trained terrorist would not know that you can't set off a plastic explosive in a shoe
[01:45:22.139 --> 01:45:22.719]  By a match.
[01:45:22.719 --> 01:45:23.980]  You cannot do it.
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:24.720]  Everybody knows that.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:28.142]  Even Marine Corps, you know, corporals know that.
[01:45:28.142 --> 01:45:33.725]  Well, that guy was completely drugged out of his mind just like the other guy who we know got on the plane when the government got him on the plane.
[01:45:35.128 --> 01:45:36.549]  That is right.
[01:45:36.549 --> 01:45:44.593]  But I do not believe, Alex, that this necessarily portends a major martial law event within a couple of days.
[01:45:44.593 --> 01:45:51.316]  I personally discount what this person who claimed to be low-level in the Marine Corps was getting from so-called intel.
[01:45:51.316 --> 01:45:53.997]  Look, I'm an officer in the Marine Corps.
[01:45:53.997 --> 01:46:01.181]  I can tell you that even a higher officer, you don't get any leaks because the Marine Corps doesn't get this kind of intel.
[01:46:01.181 --> 01:46:04.443]  It just never happens, especially down at the lower levels.
[01:46:05.603 --> 01:46:11.788]  So I really think that there's a lot of people taking advantage to try to, you know, pretend like they know something.
[01:46:11.788 --> 01:46:16.491]  I'll bet you any amount of money you won't see anything in two days in terms of martial law.
[01:46:16.491 --> 01:46:22.215]  No, no, I tend to agree with you because they want to roll things, they want to roll things out slowly.
[01:46:22.215 --> 01:46:23.857]  That's the way they're going to get us for sure.
[01:46:23.857 --> 01:46:25.958]  If they move too quick, it wakes people up.
[01:46:25.958 --> 01:46:26.999]  But... Exactly.
[01:46:27.279 --> 01:46:31.804]  But they've got state police coming out going, we're being told to prepare to have war with Christians.
[01:46:31.804 --> 01:46:35.849]  So the brainwashing is starting to get down to the lower levels.
[01:46:35.849 --> 01:46:40.634]  So I would imagine, you know, they're in a briefing going, big stuff could happen in the next few days, get ready.
[01:46:40.634 --> 01:46:41.956]  Then there's a bunch of speculation.
[01:46:43.117 --> 01:46:48.621]  You've got to remember, Alex, that a lot of this is to bait the right wing, to leak these things out.
[01:46:48.621 --> 01:46:54.966]  There is no way, I can tell you, that they will openly come out and say or tell these people we're going after because they're Christians.
[01:46:54.966 --> 01:46:56.708]  There's too many Christians in the state police.
[01:46:56.708 --> 01:46:59.310]  They would leak that, which they have.
[01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:06.196]  And what I'm saying is they're, I think, trying to bait Christians into some big uprising to make us look more radical than we really are.
[01:47:07.185 --> 01:47:11.590]  There is just no way that they would tell that, because it isn't just Christians.
[01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:13.291]  That would raise too many questions.
[01:47:13.291 --> 01:47:20.399]  They can get away with saying it's the right-wing militia, or it's the... and not even the Tea Party can they get away with particularly.
[01:47:20.399 --> 01:47:28.407]  I agree with you that it's energizing libertarians and conservatives and constitutionalists, but you're looking at it from a psychological perspective of, why is it so over the top?
[01:47:28.407 --> 01:47:29.108]  This is debate.
[01:47:29.648 --> 01:47:38.253]  They've shifted into some other psych warfare systems where they do outrageous things to create a bigger normalcy bias, so down the road we accept it.
[01:47:38.253 --> 01:47:40.514]  But I agree, they're not ready now.
[01:47:40.514 --> 01:47:45.396]  Yes, well that's what I'm saying is that we've got to be very careful of these leaks of imminency.
[01:47:45.396 --> 01:47:53.781]  I mean there was one, this so-called North Carolina trooper who got on various internet shows and says that Marshall Law was going to be in March and everything and it never happened.
[01:47:55.979 --> 01:47:57.780]  I'm just saying we've really got to be careful.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.702]  These guys are very smart what we're dealing with.
[01:47:59.702 --> 01:48:03.105]  They're not going to do anything that's going to prove that there's a conspiracy.
[01:48:03.105 --> 01:48:03.665]  I agree with you.
[01:48:03.665 --> 01:48:05.547]  Now, let me expand on this.
[01:48:05.547 --> 01:48:11.511]  They're not happy that our reporter Dan Badani, who's coming up, got into not one, but two of the press conferences and took them over.
[01:48:11.511 --> 01:48:19.938]  And we got them to basically deny that there was even a drill, even though there were drills with them announcing everything's fine, relax, stay calm.
[01:48:19.938 --> 01:48:21.059]  This is just a drill.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:31.864]  I mean, they're certainly not in control of the narrative, and they're hopping mad right now that we've injected the term false flag into the national narrative.
[01:48:31.864 --> 01:48:43.549]  Well, let me tell you that here's a mainstream television news station in the Boston area, Local 15, interviewing the University of Mobile, Alabama's cross-country coach.
[01:48:43.549 --> 01:48:46.170]  His name is Ollie Stevenson, and he says,
[01:48:48.382 --> 01:48:50.723]  He was at it near the finish line of Boston Marathon.
[01:48:50.723 --> 01:48:56.605]  There were serious explosions going off and he thought it was odd there were bomb-sniffing dogs at the start and finish lines.
[01:48:56.605 --> 01:49:02.147]  They kept making announcements to the participants not to worry, it's just a training exercise, just like you just said.
[01:49:02.147 --> 01:49:06.668]  Here is written and television confirmation with an interview that this is all true.
[01:49:06.668 --> 01:49:10.250]  In fact, he says, I don't believe it was just a training exercise.
[01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:14.051]  He says, I think they must have had some sort of threat suspicion called in.
[01:49:14.511 --> 01:49:15.431]  And that's why they were there.
[01:49:15.431 --> 01:49:18.732]  So their denial that they didn't have any idea is a pure lie.
[01:49:18.732 --> 01:49:29.415]  Well, have you heard Rob Dew, whose brother-in-law is in Army Intelligence, pretty high level, and he's a champion marathon guy, he's on the marathon team for the Army.
[01:49:29.415 --> 01:49:32.036]  He was there, because his family's from New Jersey.
[01:49:32.036 --> 01:49:36.678]  He was there and they pulled him out right towards the end and said, you need to go to the hospital, you're dehydrated.
[01:49:36.678 --> 01:49:37.778]  And he's like, what?
[01:49:37.778 --> 01:49:39.138]  And that's an order.
[01:49:39.138 --> 01:49:40.779]  Now, is that not pretty important?
[01:49:41.638 --> 01:49:47.403]  Yeah, that's an indication that somebody had advance notice of that, and I'm convinced there was.
[01:49:47.403 --> 01:49:50.045]  So, we're gonna wait and see what happens.
[01:49:50.045 --> 01:49:58.732]  I'm convinced they won't overplay this, other than to induce a lot more TSA scrutiny of every major event.
[01:49:58.732 --> 01:50:00.413]  And this will certainly justify it.
[01:50:00.413 --> 01:50:03.916]  I certainly wouldn't feel nervous about running a marathon.
[01:50:03.916 --> 01:50:08.360]  So it's part of the incremental rollout of just soft martial law?
[01:50:09.892 --> 01:50:12.735]  We don't get there overnight, we just slowly cook.
[01:50:12.735 --> 01:50:18.160]  And it does accustom people to increased scrutiny of the government.
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:20.282]  I'm just covering the World Affairs Brief for Friday.
[01:50:20.282 --> 01:50:30.091]  This almost $4 billion Homeland Security building that several congressmen are trying to stop because of the cost overruns and all of the budget sequestration, etc.
[01:50:31.152 --> 01:50:41.559]  But, you know, one comment that one of the congressmen says, if we don't stop this now before they can get everybody under one roof, he says, we'll never be able to dismantle Department of Homeland Security.
[01:50:41.559 --> 01:50:43.460]  And I think he's absolutely right.
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:46.242]  Yeah, and again, all those votes are happening right now.
[01:50:46.242 --> 01:50:52.426]  So this is a great diversion for the gun bills, the open border bills, and the Homeland Security takeover bill.
[01:50:52.426 --> 01:50:54.288]  And that's what I said at the start of the show, folks.
[01:50:54.288 --> 01:50:56.609]  Come back and tell me what you think about geopolitical movements.
[01:50:56.609 --> 01:50:59.872]  One more segment, and then Damodani's coming on, and then a bunch of other guests.
[01:51:01.468 --> 01:51:03.429]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:51:03.429 --> 01:51:05.810]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:11.233]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:51:11.233 --> 01:51:15.255]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:51:15.255 --> 01:51:19.157]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:51:19.157 --> 01:51:20.537]  The fact is, you are.
[01:51:20.537 --> 01:51:21.558]  We all are.
[01:51:21.558 --> 01:51:23.879]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:51:24.179 --> 01:51:32.665]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:51:32.665 --> 01:51:34.066]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:51:34.066 --> 01:51:37.529]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:51:37.529 --> 01:51:39.890]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:44.414]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.

[01:53:01.863 --> 01:53:07.845]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[01:53:07.845 --> 01:53:09.685]  That's closer than you think.
[01:53:09.685 --> 01:53:17.387]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[01:53:17.387 --> 01:53:24.609]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[01:53:24.609 --> 01:53:30.131]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[01:53:30.891 --> 01:53:32.272]  But here's some good news.
[01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:41.760]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:51.027]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[01:53:51.027 --> 01:53:55.231]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[01:53:55.231 --> 01:53:56.732]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[01:54:06.537 --> 01:54:14.911]  Alright, I'm kind of hyperventilating as usual just because I'm immersed in this stuff, but...
[01:54:16.004 --> 01:54:26.889]  You look at videos where Californians sign petitions to confiscate firearms and arrest constitutionalists, and it really shows how much trouble this country's in.
[01:54:26.889 --> 01:54:33.632]  But talking to Joel Skousen, who studies false flags, and then I want to look at Iran and North Korea briefly, just everything is obviously heating up.
[01:54:33.632 --> 01:54:42.596]  I'm not saying it's all going to blow up tomorrow, but there are big events, there are big expansions, there are event horizons, and I think we've clearly entered one with a crescendo of propaganda.
[01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:46.078]  But how many police would they have involved?
[01:54:46.078 --> 01:54:54.182]  Obviously, you know, they'd have an interagency secret unit within, so the other cops didn't know they'd be right next to guys that were part of the drill.
[01:54:54.182 --> 01:55:01.006]  And then they think the cops are so dumb and so compartmentalized that they blow stuff up right in front of them and then they don't even get it.
[01:55:01.006 --> 01:55:05.328]  Or if a cop does get it, like the police at Oklahoma City, they just kill them.
[01:55:05.328 --> 01:55:07.970]  I mean, how do they get away with stuff like this when it's so obvious?
[01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:12.238]  Well, you've got to remember that there's a lot of questions.
[01:55:12.238 --> 01:55:13.620]  Police aren't dumb.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:17.323]  They do see these same anomalies we do, but there's a tremendous amount of pressure inside.
[01:55:17.323 --> 01:55:22.028]  Don't say anything, and all of a sudden, you know, you're stepping on national security issues.
[01:55:22.028 --> 01:55:24.310]  They use that all the time within local police forces.
[01:55:25.110 --> 01:55:27.551]  Uh, to control, uh, what's going on.
[01:55:27.551 --> 01:55:34.275]  But they do keep it very compartmentalized so that the only people, there's only a handful that know that there's a false flag operation going on.
[01:55:34.275 --> 01:55:38.517]  A lot of people given assignments that are part of it that don't understand until it goes off.
[01:55:38.517 --> 01:55:43.399]  Then they're told a different story that this is actually, you know, a terrorist attack.
[01:55:43.399 --> 01:55:44.580]  Uh, What is the main motive?
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:46.280]  Get the agenda passed?
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:52.884]  Divert everybody to this story while they get all the gun stuff, immigration stuff, homeland security stuff rafted through?
[01:55:54.212 --> 01:55:59.273]  Well, in general, it does increase the amount of tension about terrorism.
[01:55:59.273 --> 01:56:04.134]  This will, to some extent, probably change a few votes on the gun bill.
[01:56:04.134 --> 01:56:09.795]  You know, they're really close to not getting anything.
[01:56:09.795 --> 01:56:23.658]  If it weren't for taking Toomey, you know, a supposed Republican pro-gun person, and Joe Manchin, supposedly pro-gun, to bring out and do and carry water for the establishment, they wouldn't even got anything.
[01:56:24.218 --> 01:56:43.562]  But they're probably going to get some form of background checks and there's a lot of false language and fine print in that Toomey Mansion bill that's very, very dangerous that it's going to end up registering a lot more weapons and bringing a lot more people under the guise of background checks, not just internet and gun show sales.
[01:56:44.724 --> 01:56:50.128]  But I think ultimately, they are moving slowly enough that they're increasing the pressure.
[01:56:50.128 --> 01:57:00.275]  We won't know until they actually try to blame somebody for this Boston bombing, but I suspect it's going to be to insert a whole other level of homeland security into the nation.
[01:57:00.275 --> 01:57:02.136]  I think that's what they're aiming for.
[01:57:02.136 --> 01:57:07.800]  And it's going to be at major sporting events, it's going to be at marathons, you're going to see homeland security and lots of...
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:14.524]  Well, they're already announcing that, oh, we've had Army and TSA and Kentucky Derby, but now there'll be three times more, and it'll be in your town.
[01:57:14.524 --> 01:57:20.729]  Everywhere, the idea that government, there were 400 troops there, there were checkpoints there, didn't protect people.
[01:57:20.729 --> 01:57:23.371]  I mean, this is the takeover of society.
[01:57:23.831 --> 01:57:24.711]  That's a very good point.
[01:57:24.711 --> 01:57:26.212]  Great piece on your website there.
[01:57:26.212 --> 01:57:28.693]  They predicted it and sure enough it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:57:50.296 --> 01:57:52.142]  Okay, we're going to break here in one minute.
[01:57:52.142 --> 01:57:55.974]  Give people the best website, because I know there's Joel Scalzin, but there's also World Affairs Brief.
[01:57:55.974 --> 01:57:57.278]  What's the best one for folks to go to?
[01:57:58.286 --> 01:58:09.352]  Well, it is worldaffairsbrief.com and people can get a free sample issue of the North Korea analysis I'm giving by emailing me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:58:09.352 --> 01:58:12.093]  And you think that's going to blow over?
[01:58:12.093 --> 01:58:13.454]  It is, Alex.
[01:58:13.454 --> 01:58:21.058]  And I'll tell you the special reason why I think that China allowed this to go through and what they're going to gain from these future missile tests that are going to come through.
[01:58:21.058 --> 01:58:21.478]  What is it?
[01:58:22.571 --> 01:58:31.456]  Well, basically, they're going to launch a salvo of missiles to test our ballistic missile systems to see how many we can track and how many we can respond to.
[01:58:31.456 --> 01:58:35.639]  That's something that Russia and China have been waiting to test for a long time.
[01:58:35.639 --> 01:58:37.400]  And this gives them the excuse.
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:37.700]  Wow.
[01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:41.882]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[01:58:41.882 --> 01:58:43.243]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.243 --> 01:58:46.065]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.641 --> 01:59:00.186]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:59:00.186 --> 01:59:03.868]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:59:03.868 --> 01:59:08.311]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:59:08.311 --> 01:59:13.374]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[01:59:13.374 --> 01:59:20.878]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus.
[01:59:20.998 --> 01:59:21.258]  I think so.
[01:59:54.184 --> 01:59:56.567]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.567 --> 01:59:59.331]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.004 --> 02:00:10.827]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.827 --> 02:00:12.428]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.428 --> 02:00:13.989]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.989 --> 02:00:18.171]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.171 --> 02:00:23.314]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.314 --> 02:00:26.756]  Hey, I know we've got Army folks and police and Marines holding.
[02:00:26.756 --> 02:00:29.298]  I'm gonna get your quick take on this after the break, and then, uh...
[02:00:30.438 --> 02:00:34.180]  We're going to have another guest joining us, Doug Hagman, who predicted all this on Monday.
[02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:37.181]  You know, talked about how it was imminent, Obama was about to double down.
[02:00:37.181 --> 02:00:38.641]  I mean, this is a false flag, no doubt.
[02:00:38.641 --> 02:00:42.823]  Now they're talking about how the duffel bag, the bombs, were just sitting there for a while.
[02:00:42.823 --> 02:00:45.304]  And the police are like, never mind, drill, move on.
[02:00:45.304 --> 02:00:49.266]  I mean, normally a, you know, a donut pastry box falls on the ground.
[02:00:49.266 --> 02:00:55.468]  They bring in dogs and robots and, only we protect you from the non-existent bombs.
[02:00:55.468 --> 02:00:56.649]  All the cities in the U.S.
[02:00:57.509 --> 02:01:01.112]  Are we getting Homeland Security funds for giant anti-bomb robots?
[02:01:01.112 --> 02:01:03.914]  This is a military-industrial complex PR rollout.
[02:01:03.914 --> 02:01:06.055]  How do we sell $50 billion worth of robots?
[02:01:06.055 --> 02:01:09.978]  I mean, Austin spent like $3 million.
[02:01:09.978 --> 02:01:11.259]  They spent like $3 million.
[02:01:11.259 --> 02:01:14.461]  Look it up.
[02:01:14.461 --> 02:01:18.804]  I think it was more on some robots for the non-existent bombs.
[02:01:18.804 --> 02:01:22.766]  But the government said, there will be bombs in every city routinely.
[02:01:22.766 --> 02:01:23.227]  Get ready.
[02:01:24.616 --> 02:01:30.800]  And I guess it'll always, I guess they'll get the cops out with the bomb truck and they'll go find a little kid and just go over to the stick.
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:31.841]  Hold this for me, Sonny.
[02:01:31.841 --> 02:01:36.023]  I'm a big black bomb with a fuse on it.
[02:01:36.023 --> 02:01:41.187]  Bye-bye, Sonny Pie.
[02:01:41.187 --> 02:01:42.788]  Oh, man, this is too incredible.
[02:01:42.788 --> 02:01:46.290]  Also, you guys can sit around all day and be on the Imaginary Bomb Squad.
[02:01:47.602 --> 02:01:49.303]  You know, you gotta blow us up here and there.
[02:01:49.303 --> 02:01:51.545]  I mean, there is just no end to this government.
[02:01:51.545 --> 02:01:52.966]  But of course, it's their whole business.
[02:01:52.966 --> 02:01:54.647]  It's a human sacrifice.
[02:01:54.647 --> 02:01:59.450]  Our ancestors used to sacrifice people, believing it made the harvest be better.
[02:01:59.450 --> 02:02:06.275]  And now they just blow stuff up and, you know, I would imagine they're like, here, sonny, sit on my duffel bag for me.
[02:02:06.275 --> 02:02:10.258]  Okay, mister, you know, so they can kill the little kid and use them all over the news.
[02:02:10.258 --> 02:02:13.781]  I mean, they're just, of course, they want to kill you with vaccines anyways, why not kill you now?
[02:02:15.106 --> 02:02:16.907]  So we'll get everybody's take on that.
[02:02:16.907 --> 02:02:21.448]  And again, I've been trying to get Dan Bodondi on, but his Skype's been up and down.
[02:02:21.448 --> 02:02:25.209]  So we'll get a... Oh, he's back.
[02:02:25.209 --> 02:02:33.452]  Dan, we're going to break here in a minute, but I'll bring you back and then take calls and then go to Mr. Hagman ahead of Stuart Rhodes popping in, Oath Keepers, to get his take on this.
[02:02:33.452 --> 02:02:36.033]  But Joel Skousen says false flag.
[02:02:36.033 --> 02:02:37.513]  I mean, how could it not be?
[02:02:37.513 --> 02:02:39.354]  This is so ridiculous now.
[02:02:40.194 --> 02:02:44.137]  And we're just waiting for the other shoe to drop, the right-wing Patsy they're going to try to blame.
[02:02:44.137 --> 02:02:50.781]  They're already trying to mix the term right-wing in with Al-Qaeda, the group that's completely Islamophobic.
[02:02:50.781 --> 02:02:53.703]  Dan, good job getting your question into the governors and others.
[02:02:53.703 --> 02:02:56.164]  No doubt you shut down their press conferences.
[02:02:56.164 --> 02:02:58.346]  What can you tell us about behind the scenes, Dan Bodondi?
[02:02:59.287 --> 02:03:25.128]  Um, as soon as I asked the question, and I, you know, asked it again, and they would not answer the question, and I got the look of death from every federal agency that was there, the, um, the government officials, everything, and I knew right away I had to grab my camera quick, you know, as soon as the press conference was over, because, uh, the woman gets right on the stage, obviously, at the end of the press conference, and everybody's, you know, gives me the look of death, so I grabbed my equipment, and I jetted right out of there, but, I mean, like, um, it was crazy.
[02:03:25.128 --> 02:03:28.671]  I mean, you know, it was like the first question out, and all of a sudden they called the press conference.
[02:03:28.871 --> 02:03:40.295]  You know, it's because you put them on a stand, you oppose them with real questions, and all of a sudden the mainstream media don't like it because... Well, that's why I hired you, is because you are fearless.
[02:03:40.295 --> 02:03:44.936]  And I know you get homesick when you go up to see your son and your family, everybody back in Rhode Island.
[02:03:44.936 --> 02:03:48.557]  But as an East Coast reporter, the reports you file every week are just phenomenal.
[02:03:48.557 --> 02:03:52.158]  And we're hiring more editors, so soon we can get more of your reports out.
[02:03:52.158 --> 02:03:53.499]  You know, you send us the raw footage.
[02:03:53.499 --> 02:03:54.959]  But great job, Dan.
[02:03:54.959 --> 02:03:57.040]  Tell us about more behind the scenes.
[02:03:58.081 --> 02:04:18.524]  Oh, when I got there, I mean, right away, I mean, I seen, uh, armored vehicles driving by, I got pictures I sent to do, and, um, I got video I'm gonna be posting soon, um, we got, I was found, actually, the military and the police, they were going from, in the alleyways, from, you know, going, looking at people's cars, into the garages, with, uh, automatic assault weapons, and, uh, just looking for bombs and everything.
[02:04:18.664 --> 02:04:20.365]  Yeah, the bombs they planted.
[02:04:20.365 --> 02:04:24.247]  The military is taking over the area.
[02:04:24.247 --> 02:04:27.809]  The news is they are in control, and they are running the investigation.
[02:04:27.809 --> 02:04:28.909]  We're just learning.
[02:04:28.909 --> 02:04:30.450]  Oh, the military's here!
[02:04:30.450 --> 02:04:33.791]  Totally illegal, but they'll keep us safe from those bombs, Dan.
[02:04:33.791 --> 02:04:38.013]  Tell us more of what you've witnessed there in Boston, where you've been reporting since yesterday afternoon.
[02:04:38.013 --> 02:04:41.555]  Dan Badondi, Infowars.com reporter.
[02:04:41.555 --> 02:04:44.537]  And again, look at Infowars on the cutting edge of the reporting.
[02:04:44.537 --> 02:04:46.858]  We'll also give you an update on some of the latest breaking news.
[02:04:47.478 --> 02:04:48.881]  That's up at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:04:48.881 --> 02:04:59.059]  We're going to get to your phone calls, and then Doug Hagman, and then at about 40 after, via phone, we're going to have Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers on, jam-packed third hour right now.
[02:05:01.337 --> 02:05:08.540]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:26.429]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:05:26.429 --> 02:05:30.551]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:05:30.831 --> 02:05:32.593]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:05:32.593 --> 02:05:40.759]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:07:00.726 --> 02:07:03.751]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:07:03.751 --> 02:07:08.778]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:07:08.778 --> 02:07:15.949]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:07:16.089 --> 02:07:21.714]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:07:21.714 --> 02:07:25.738]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:07:25.738 --> 02:07:30.463]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:07:30.463 --> 02:07:35.688]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:07:35.928 --> 02:07:37.408]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:08:06.593 --> 02:08:14.117]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:08:14.117 --> 02:08:24.502]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.502 --> 02:08:26.603]  We are now eight minutes into the
[02:08:29.090 --> 02:08:39.137]  Third hour here today, and we are tracking the tragic 100-plus dead, 100 injured, 3 dead there at the Boston Marathon.
[02:08:39.137 --> 02:08:47.643]  But my only point is, and I have a clip of this coming up in a few minutes, is Obama says, if it's a bomb and it kills civilians, it's terrorism.
[02:08:47.643 --> 02:08:49.325]  Which I tend to agree.
[02:08:49.325 --> 02:08:50.586]  But when, you know,
[02:08:52.051 --> 02:09:00.939]  Our military, working for the Globalist, goes in and kills a million-plus Iraqis with sanctions and bombs and weapons in the last 15 years.
[02:09:00.939 --> 02:09:02.380]  Madeleine Albright doesn't deny it.
[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:05.743]  She says it's a good price to pay.
[02:09:05.743 --> 02:09:17.134]  And I've seen cases where they've killed over 200 people with a Predator drone, you know, a wedding, a 1,000-pound, 2,000-pound bomb, to get one bad guy who hasn't been convicted
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:19.761]  And there's really no proof.
[02:09:19.761 --> 02:09:24.065]  And look, our government runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and gives them 10,000 heat-seeking missiles.
[02:09:24.065 --> 02:09:25.907]  They run Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:25.907 --> 02:09:29.349]  And then they'll kill a whole family.
[02:09:29.349 --> 02:09:34.634]  And I'll see the video on Pakistani TV, blood everywhere, arms, legs.
[02:09:34.634 --> 02:09:38.277]  You try to show that, they will kick you off YouTube.
[02:09:38.277 --> 02:09:40.078]  You cover that, you're a traitor.
[02:09:40.078 --> 02:09:42.821]  Because you're not supposed to personalize those people.
[02:09:42.821 --> 02:09:44.962]  Back in the day of Walter Cronkite, they'd show a naked
[02:09:45.854 --> 02:09:50.822]  Eight-year-old Vietnamese girl running down a path, a rice paddy with her skin hanging off from napalm.
[02:09:51.755 --> 02:09:53.516]  But now they won't show it.
[02:09:53.516 --> 02:09:58.959]  They'll show all the fake violence, zombies, murder, death, most horrific up-close stuff.
[02:09:58.959 --> 02:10:02.380]  But that's simulated killing, which conditions you to not care.
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:04.922]  But if it's the real thing, you're not supposed to see it.
[02:10:04.922 --> 02:10:08.263]  You're not supposed to even see the flag-draped coffins of our dead troops.
[02:10:08.263 --> 02:10:12.666]  You're supposed to just say you're patriotic, but then, you know, once they actually get back, treat them like garbage.
[02:10:12.666 --> 02:10:20.950]  There are troops all over Boston and other major cities, not just here, but worldwide, all part of the security theater,
[02:10:21.930 --> 02:10:30.496]  And again, 400 troops, checkpoints, a drill, and it didn't protect anybody.
[02:10:30.496 --> 02:10:35.419]  It didn't protect anybody.
[02:10:35.419 --> 02:10:38.881]  So now they're saying we're gonna have TSA and troops everywhere in America.
[02:10:38.881 --> 02:10:40.102]  Will that protect you?
[02:10:40.102 --> 02:10:48.507]  And again, they sold billions of dollars of robots to local... Austin's bought a couple multi-million dollar robots for the coming bombing.
[02:10:48.507 --> 02:10:49.828]  We will be bombed, they said.
[02:10:51.224 --> 02:10:54.847]  I guess if they hype it enough, mentally ill people might actually try to do it.
[02:10:54.847 --> 02:11:01.311]  And then they pull you over and say, this Tannerite you had for your shooting show is a bomb.
[02:11:01.311 --> 02:11:02.672]  I bought it at the local store.
[02:11:02.672 --> 02:11:04.234]  Well, you're going to jail anyways.
[02:11:04.234 --> 02:11:06.135]  Or you've got black powder for black powder hunting.
[02:11:06.135 --> 02:11:07.116]  We're going to take you to jail.
[02:11:07.116 --> 02:11:09.777]  Or, look, you have jumper cables, pipe bombs.
[02:11:09.777 --> 02:11:14.261]  I mean, this is the new hysteria of bombs, bombs, when you've got three people dead.
[02:11:15.134 --> 02:11:16.094]  What's the latest?
[02:11:16.094 --> 02:11:18.035]  Over 100 injured and how many have died?
[02:11:18.035 --> 02:11:18.555]  Three, right?
[02:11:18.555 --> 02:11:20.035]  I'm going from memory.
[02:11:20.035 --> 02:11:28.497]  Real quick, Dan Badanti, our reporter, that took over both press conferences and they cancelled the press conferences because he was asking real questions about, hey, what about the drill?
[02:11:28.497 --> 02:11:30.697]  And they're like, there was no drill, Sonny.
[02:11:30.697 --> 02:11:32.517]  Even though the drills are admitted, that's a big deal.
[02:11:32.517 --> 02:11:35.718]  Then we're going to your phone calls and then to Doug Hagman.
[02:11:35.718 --> 02:11:39.979]  Go ahead and make your points there, Dan, on what else you saw while you're there in Boston.
[02:11:40.728 --> 02:11:47.615]  Well, I talked to a lot of the athletes who participated in the event and they had the same scenario if they heard or seen the bomb.
[02:11:47.615 --> 02:11:52.260]  They said the first thing they, you know, the first one they thought was just a firework or something.
[02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:56.485]  Then when the second one went off, that's when they knew there was something wrong.
[02:11:56.485 --> 02:12:00.128]  And, I mean, you had the massive police state that was already there.
[02:12:00.128 --> 02:12:01.470]  That's got to make you question one thing.
[02:12:01.710 --> 02:12:17.923]  I know it's a big event, people say they ask behind security, no doubt, but, you know, for them to be having drills, and Local 15 reported that there was announcements being made moments before the bombs went off to tell people to remain calm, but you didn't hear that, you know what I'm saying?
[02:12:17.923 --> 02:12:20.625]  You didn't hear that, you didn't see that, you didn't build that, you know what I mean?
[02:12:20.625 --> 02:12:28.572]  And you didn't hear that stuff because, you know, the government knows what's best for you, and, you know, this is showing true signs of a false flag.
[02:12:28.572 --> 02:12:30.193]  I mean, I'm calling false flags all over the place.
[02:12:30.213 --> 02:12:35.216]  Yeah, because people noticed him placing the big duffel bag bombs to be homemade to whoever drugged up Patsy.
[02:12:35.216 --> 02:12:36.657]  They've got to blame it on him.
[02:12:36.657 --> 02:12:38.578]  And it's like, never mind this.
[02:12:38.578 --> 02:12:40.600]  Ma'am, can your son sit on the duffel bag?
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:43.221]  This is only a drill.
[02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:44.782]  Hug the bag.
[02:12:44.782 --> 02:12:47.384]  Marines are trained to jump on the hand grenade.
[02:12:47.384 --> 02:12:51.026]  And absolutely, this thing, they ran the anthrax attack.
[02:12:51.026 --> 02:12:53.508]  That later came out.
[02:12:53.508 --> 02:12:55.309]  They ran 7-7.
[02:12:55.309 --> 02:12:56.390]  That was drills.
[02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:57.931]  It's the same thing, Dan.
[02:12:57.931 --> 02:12:59.392]  Other points that you'd like to add?
[02:13:00.182 --> 02:13:06.464]  Well, the point, Stu, I want to make real quick, it's in kind of relation to this, is the first U.S.
[02:13:06.464 --> 02:13:10.326]  nuclear power plant to be formally tested for a terrorist attack plan.
[02:13:10.326 --> 02:13:16.588]  This is reported by the Patriot News, Central Pennsylvania News, as we are saying today.
[02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:20.729]  Yes, NBC News, Three Mile Island to conduct hostile action drill.
[02:13:20.729 --> 02:13:23.390]  Yes, everyone's, but who stands to gain?
[02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:26.271]  Who wants the funding for the police state takeover?
[02:13:26.271 --> 02:13:27.031]  Who stands to gain?
[02:13:27.031 --> 02:13:27.651]  Who has the motive?
[02:13:27.651 --> 02:13:28.872]  Who's been caught doing this before?
[02:13:29.431 --> 02:13:32.914]  Well, I'm sure the FBI, I mean, how many times do they have their hand in the plot?
[02:13:32.914 --> 02:13:46.185]  They're actually giving bombs to the so-called terrorists, coaching them, being in relations with them for a couple years just to get them, you know, get them the firearms or whatever they needed, then that last minute they come in as the saviors even though they gave them the gun.
[02:13:46.565 --> 02:13:47.886]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:13:47.886 --> 02:13:50.688]  In fact, I have the New York Times article from April 28th last year.
[02:13:50.688 --> 02:13:54.130]  Terrorist plots hatched by the FBI.
[02:13:54.130 --> 02:13:55.811]  Document cam on this, thank you guys.
[02:13:55.811 --> 02:14:05.037]  And it goes through the fact that they create completely fake terror groups and try to let them then carry out the bombings like the first World Trade Center bombing was a FBI operation.
[02:14:05.037 --> 02:14:06.759]  New York Times.
[02:14:06.759 --> 02:14:10.481]  But the media says Alex claims the FBI has hatched plots.
[02:14:10.481 --> 02:14:12.983]  No, it's been admitted in court.
[02:14:12.983 --> 02:14:15.584]  Here it is, your precious New York Times.
[02:14:15.584 --> 02:14:16.085]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:14:16.765 --> 02:14:21.847]  And right away, right away they made the announcement that the FBI is taking over the investigation.
[02:14:21.847 --> 02:14:24.388]  And like I knew that was going to happen in the first place.
[02:14:24.388 --> 02:14:27.449]  And it was just like, they were already there.
[02:14:27.449 --> 02:14:33.411]  I mean, it was just like all the points we already said, just like 9-11, just like Oklahoma City, just like Waco.
[02:14:33.411 --> 02:14:34.931]  It's just like one after another.
[02:14:34.931 --> 02:14:42.934]  I mean, how many times, Alex, have you told people, show government documents, Army field manuals about stage of false flag terror, but yet,
[02:14:43.234 --> 02:14:46.598]  People still deny it and say, oh, there's no such thing as false flag.
[02:14:46.598 --> 02:14:49.241]  Terror wins right in their faces by their own government.
[02:14:49.241 --> 02:14:52.905]  By the way, I saw the footage of you asking the governor, could this be a false flag?
[02:14:52.905 --> 02:14:55.348]  Notice he knew what that was, to take our liberties.
[02:14:55.348 --> 02:14:58.111]  And he looked like a bad guy, a Dr. Evil, a black doctor.
[02:14:58.151 --> 02:14:58.371]  I don't
[02:15:17.227 --> 02:15:18.067]  Well, absolutely.
[02:15:18.067 --> 02:15:19.968]  And ignorance shows guilt, right there.
[02:15:19.968 --> 02:15:21.528]  When you're ignorant, you're showing guilt.
[02:15:21.528 --> 02:15:23.628]  I mean, now you got the look of death.
[02:15:23.628 --> 02:15:27.169]  And I, all the way till they left the room, I'm pounding them.
[02:15:27.169 --> 02:15:28.130]  What about the drills?
[02:15:28.130 --> 02:15:30.790]  What about the, you know, is this a false flag terror, you know?
[02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:32.551]  And I called it how I seen it.
[02:15:32.551 --> 02:15:37.412]  And just the look on the FBI's face, I mean, I wish I could put the camera in that guy's face.
[02:15:39.731 --> 02:15:46.355]  A heavy FBI agent at the time there just gave me this look like if it looks like a kill, I would have been annihilated.
[02:15:46.355 --> 02:15:48.236]  And it was crazy.
[02:15:48.236 --> 02:15:49.236]  Well, you're right.
[02:15:49.236 --> 02:15:54.759]  And again, we're rolling some video here of the governor at the press conference after you asked your question.
[02:15:54.759 --> 02:15:56.000]  And there's more footage of it.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.121]  In fact, I was seeing a widescreen of it earlier.
[02:15:58.121 --> 02:15:59.162]  He looks so upset.
[02:15:59.662 --> 02:16:03.684]  And so shifty eye in the close-up shots of this.
[02:16:03.684 --> 02:16:06.145]  Dan, I tell you, you're doing a great job and God bless you.
[02:16:06.145 --> 02:16:07.805]  We'll keep reporting.
[02:16:07.805 --> 02:16:12.587]  Upload them to your InfoWars YouTube channel and we'll air them here on the main radio show.
[02:16:12.587 --> 02:16:13.107]  God bless you.
[02:16:13.107 --> 02:16:13.627]  Great job.
[02:16:13.627 --> 02:16:13.928]  Be safe.
[02:16:13.928 --> 02:16:14.648]  God bless, Alex.
[02:16:14.648 --> 02:16:14.908]  Thank you.
[02:16:15.208 --> 02:16:15.448]  Thank you.
[02:16:15.448 --> 02:16:19.712]  I want to get to some calls ahead of Doug Hagman and his intel on this.
[02:16:19.712 --> 02:16:25.717]  And then Stuart Rhodes just got off an airplane, is getting to a position to be able to call in for Oath Keepers.
[02:16:25.717 --> 02:16:28.639]  He's on his way to Boston right now.
[02:16:28.639 --> 02:16:33.243]  But yeah, there's the close-up footage of the governor acting completely shifty-eyed whenever Banandi asks his question.
[02:16:35.095 --> 02:16:38.716]  We're going to go ahead now and go to some of the calls that have been holding so long.
[02:16:38.716 --> 02:16:40.416]  I appreciate people holding.
[02:16:40.416 --> 02:16:46.137]  Craig and Mass, former police, what is your take on this whole thing, sir?
[02:16:46.137 --> 02:16:47.117]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[02:16:47.117 --> 02:16:47.837]  Great job.
[02:16:47.837 --> 02:16:51.398]  I think you're right with the false flag theory.
[02:16:51.398 --> 02:16:57.019]  Yesterday they unveiled the Homeland Security vehicles with millions, all black.
[02:16:57.019 --> 02:17:03.520]  And what were the Sandy Hook parents sitting in the grandstands about 50 yards up from the explosion?
[02:17:04.693 --> 02:17:08.055]  Why did they have to bring them into it?
[02:17:08.055 --> 02:17:09.856]  I think there's a... you're right.
[02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:28.870]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:17:52.406 --> 02:17:53.767]  No, that's Homeland Security.
[02:17:53.767 --> 02:17:55.688]  They tell you what it has to look like.
[02:17:55.688 --> 02:17:57.289]  And it's a secret police.
[02:17:57.289 --> 02:18:00.051]  And they're making local police federalized.
[02:18:00.051 --> 02:18:02.032]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble.
[02:18:02.032 --> 02:18:08.796]  And the training manuals, the stuff that they give the police now is like a joke.
[02:18:08.796 --> 02:18:13.359]  I mean, it's so over the top that obviously the feds are the bad guys.
[02:18:13.359 --> 02:18:16.200]  But hey, they're saying Christian gun owners are the new enemy.
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:17.141]  Worse than Al-Qaeda.
[02:18:17.141 --> 02:18:18.242]  What's worse than Al-Qaeda?
[02:18:18.242 --> 02:18:18.642]  Christians.
[02:18:19.534 --> 02:18:20.975]  You're right, but one quick thing.
[02:18:20.975 --> 02:18:25.337]  As far as the police takeover, I was law enforcement for years.
[02:18:25.337 --> 02:18:30.260]  I'm retired, but they're our brothers, sisters, sons, aunts, daughters.
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:37.244]  When the day comes when they're supposed to turn on us, most of them are going to lay down their weapons, and they're not going to do it.
[02:18:37.244 --> 02:18:38.545]  And I'm just praying that that day
[02:18:39.782 --> 02:18:40.603]  It's a communist state.
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:03.584]  Can I tell you a quick story real quick?
[02:19:03.584 --> 02:19:04.626]  I was out in the southwest.
[02:19:04.626 --> 02:19:07.689]  I don't want to say the state visiting my son out near you.
[02:19:07.689 --> 02:19:09.071]  I was coming back with my wife.
[02:19:09.071 --> 02:19:12.555]  I was at Sky Harbor Airport.
[02:19:12.555 --> 02:19:13.837]  It was 1030 at night.
[02:19:13.837 --> 02:19:15.198]  I saw a guy with a yellow FAA
[02:19:15.959 --> 02:19:16.780]  Best.
[02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:19.421]  Taking pictures of a license plate illegally parked.
[02:19:19.421 --> 02:19:22.003]  So I had my camera, which I like taking pictures.
[02:19:22.003 --> 02:19:23.164]  I took a picture near him.
[02:19:23.164 --> 02:19:26.466]  He come over to me and said, why did you take that picture?
[02:19:26.466 --> 02:19:28.007]  And I said, you know why I took the picture?
[02:19:28.007 --> 02:19:31.489]  Because I wanted to, and this is still America.
[02:19:31.489 --> 02:19:33.670]  And then he says, well, why were you taking the picture up there?
[02:19:33.670 --> 02:19:36.072]  I says, because I like architecture.
[02:19:36.072 --> 02:19:39.193]  I took a picture of the old bridge, like the walkway.
[02:19:39.193 --> 02:19:41.355]  And I thought that, my wife said, what the heck was that?
[02:19:41.946 --> 02:19:42.427]  Oh, no, no.
[02:19:42.427 --> 02:19:48.432]  Everything is about how we're guilty, but they never are, when most of the perpetrators are the false flag insiders.
[02:19:48.432 --> 02:19:49.634]  And that's just a historical fact.
[02:19:49.634 --> 02:19:51.656]  They're like, how dare you look at me?
[02:19:51.656 --> 02:19:52.496]  Well, you have the motive.
[02:19:52.496 --> 02:19:53.477]  You have the history.
[02:19:53.477 --> 02:19:55.159]  You've done it over and over again.
[02:19:55.159 --> 02:19:55.920]  Absolutely.
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:56.520]  It's incredible.
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:57.521]  God bless you, sir.
[02:19:57.521 --> 02:20:00.144]  More calls coming up, and we've got special guests joining us.
[02:20:01.786 --> 02:20:03.346]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:20:03.346 --> 02:20:09.448]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[02:20:09.448 --> 02:20:17.629]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics!

[02:20:59.665 --> 02:21:00.347]  Life's getting better!
[02:21:01.263 --> 02:21:03.205]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:21:03.205 --> 02:21:05.346]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:21:05.346 --> 02:21:11.591]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:21:11.591 --> 02:21:15.053]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:21:15.053 --> 02:21:18.936]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:21:18.936 --> 02:21:20.337]  The fact is, you are.
[02:21:20.337 --> 02:21:21.358]  We all are.
[02:21:21.358 --> 02:21:23.680]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:21:23.980 --> 02:21:32.464]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[02:21:32.464 --> 02:21:33.845]  Be prepared before you need it.

[02:22:00.757 --> 02:22:07.420]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.420 --> 02:22:15.543]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.543 --> 02:22:23.366]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.706 --> 02:22:28.792]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.792 --> 02:22:34.018]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:34.018 --> 02:22:38.383]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.383 --> 02:22:39.464]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:22:48.854 --> 02:22:51.857]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:22:57.363 --> 02:23:02.748]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[02:23:02.748 --> 02:23:06.572]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor
[02:23:06.732 --> 02:23:07.252]  We're good to go!
[02:23:34.306 --> 02:23:46.858]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:23:46.858 --> 02:23:48.860]  It is One World Whey.

[02:24:09.087 --> 02:24:26.736]  Alex Jones here back live and when the official radio show ends here in about 35 minutes I'm going into overdrive that some stations carry with Oath Keepers founder Stuart Rhodes constitutional lawyer veteran
[02:24:28.107 --> 02:24:33.372]  He's on his way to Boston for the 19th event, and they're trying to blame it on domestic groups, as you know right now.
[02:24:33.372 --> 02:24:42.220]  Regardless, they're mixing the term Al-Qaeda with conservative now, or libertarian, because we oppose the unconstitutional things that are happening.
[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:48.906]  We're going to go to Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network, who did a great job on Coast to Coast AM last night breaking all this down.
[02:24:48.906 --> 02:24:51.068]  I'll be on for the full show tonight.
[02:24:52.492 --> 02:24:53.693]  I know I don't work hard enough.
[02:24:53.693 --> 02:25:00.336]  We did 11 hours yesterday, and I got about 5 hours sleep, and I'm doing this, and then I'm doing cusp to cusp.
[02:25:00.336 --> 02:25:02.398]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[02:25:02.398 --> 02:25:06.720]  If I'm going to risk my life for liberty, I'm going to go 110%.
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:15.325]  That doesn't mean sometimes I'm not going to be making mistakes or stumbling around in the great exertion, but I'm on the field here.
[02:25:17.081 --> 02:25:22.705]  Now, you just heard Joel Skousen, who I really respect, saying, clear false flag.
[02:25:22.705 --> 02:25:27.507]  They are breathlessly on the news trying to tie it into Sandy Hook and domestic stuff.
[02:25:27.507 --> 02:25:28.568]  Terror in Boston.
[02:25:28.568 --> 02:25:32.951]  Hagel, the SEC def says Pentagon ready to violate posse comitatus.
[02:25:32.951 --> 02:25:34.632]  They already are.
[02:25:34.632 --> 02:25:37.113]  So that rollout's happening.
[02:25:37.113 --> 02:25:41.476]  They're saying it's a positive to get the gun bills passed because this diverts the political heat off of them.
[02:25:42.645 --> 02:25:45.987]  Man, Homeland Security being given autonomous total takeover power.
[02:25:45.987 --> 02:25:47.188]  That's happening right now.
[02:25:47.188 --> 02:25:48.649]  This is perfect timing.
[02:25:48.649 --> 02:25:52.931]  Big Sis said, give me money or there'll be a terror attack and give us more power.
[02:25:52.931 --> 02:25:54.292]  I mean, this is 101.
[02:25:54.292 --> 02:25:56.213]  Every time they're about to pass, more power.
[02:25:56.213 --> 02:25:57.214]  This happens.
[02:25:57.214 --> 02:25:59.055]  Obama insider admits to link
[02:26:00.736 --> 02:26:03.798]  Attempts to link Boston bombing to tax day.
[02:26:03.798 --> 02:26:04.998]  Boston massacre.
[02:26:04.998 --> 02:26:08.321]  Obama looks to tax day for right-wing terror explanation.
[02:26:08.321 --> 02:26:12.243]  Family Guy episode predicts Boston Marathon attack.
[02:26:12.243 --> 02:26:13.624]  Boston Marathon bombing.
[02:26:13.624 --> 02:26:15.785]  Who do they plan to blame?
[02:26:15.785 --> 02:26:19.228]  Eyewitness authorities must have known about bombing.
[02:26:19.228 --> 02:26:22.289]  Official story unraveling from Boston Marathon bombing.
[02:26:22.289 --> 02:26:27.193]  That's all at PrisonPlanet.com, our backup auxiliary site, and InfoWars.com.
[02:26:27.913 --> 02:26:32.998]  And we have the free video feeds and audio feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash Twitter.

[02:26:39.325 --> 02:26:46.191]  I'm going to tweet right now that video link for your friends and family so you can send it out to folks so they can tune in because we're going to be live.
[02:26:47.162 --> 02:26:49.904]  Uh, now right till about 8 or 9 tonight.

[02:26:53.866 --> 02:27:00.289]  But, uh, we're going to be live continually here, so Infowars.com forward slash, uh, listen.

[02:27:03.331 --> 02:27:04.691]  They'll take an hour or two of your calls.
[02:27:04.691 --> 02:27:07.213]  So, uh, heavy calls coming up.
[02:27:07.213 --> 02:27:08.994]  We're going to break here in a moment for the rest of the hour.
[02:27:09.754 --> 02:27:11.376]  Doug Hagman will be with us.
[02:27:11.376 --> 02:27:13.418]  Sorry I've gone to my guests a little late today.
[02:27:13.418 --> 02:27:16.841]  You start going a little late to each guest and it builds up by the end.
[02:27:16.841 --> 02:27:32.955]  But Doug, the most devastating evidence is that Rob Dew, my news director, constantly argues with his defense intelligence brother-in-law, who is actually pretty high up in it, and he's on the Army Marathon team, and he can run 24 miles in his sleep.
[02:27:35.057 --> 02:27:45.782]  He was running, he was pretty much fine, and they came over and said, you're dehydrated, we're pulling you out, because he was up towards the front, coming up to the finish line, right before all this happened.
[02:27:45.782 --> 02:27:47.823]  They're running drills, all of this.
[02:27:47.823 --> 02:27:51.725]  Hagman, what is your latest intel from the Northeast Intelligence Network?
[02:27:51.725 --> 02:27:55.247]  You're up there, you have the best sources on the East Coast.
[02:27:55.247 --> 02:28:01.210]  You said Monday, Obama's about to double down, imminent terror attack, and you were right, so here you are.
[02:28:02.489 --> 02:28:03.369]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[02:28:03.369 --> 02:28:05.550]  I've got to tell you this.
[02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:12.213]  According to my sources, there's just so much to this that we're not hearing that we may never hear about.
[02:28:12.213 --> 02:28:15.675]  But I think you've done a great job in breaking things down here.
[02:28:15.675 --> 02:28:16.035]  You've got
[02:28:19.097 --> 02:28:25.142]  Various situations that mirror historical terrorist attacks here in this country.
[02:28:25.142 --> 02:28:39.675]  And one thing that I was really concerned about is, you know, with all of the accusations of saying, well, you can't really say this is a false flag attack or you can't really conclude anything.
[02:28:39.675 --> 02:28:42.197]  While that might be a true statement today.
[02:28:43.418 --> 02:29:09.674]  You know are we wrong to be a little bit jaded or a little bit gun-shy about About what we're seeing here with respect to to this incident the fact that that this appears to fit a template that we've seen in the past with the training drills with the With the even the prior warnings with the with with the dogs explosive sniffing dogs
[02:29:10.314 --> 02:29:14.536]  The extreme police presence, the drills, so on and so forth.
[02:29:14.536 --> 02:29:20.140]  I don't think we're wrong to question the facts at all or question the motives at all.
[02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:29.785]  Especially over the last 24 hours when you have, as you've pointed out, the Axelrods and the others coming out and saying, hey, wait a minute.
[02:29:29.785 --> 02:29:33.427]  This could very well be a Patriot-related attack.
[02:29:33.427 --> 02:29:35.328]  They were saying it within one hour.
[02:29:36.328 --> 02:29:37.569]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:29:37.569 --> 02:29:41.411]  So, everything's the agenda on that side.
[02:29:41.411 --> 02:29:45.074]  There's no real Tea Party person that would blow up people at that.
[02:29:45.074 --> 02:29:46.534]  They'd attack the UN or something.
[02:29:46.534 --> 02:29:47.815]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:47.815 --> 02:29:49.236]  Why does nobody ever do that, by the way?
[02:29:49.236 --> 02:29:50.817]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.817 --> 02:29:52.198]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.198 --> 02:29:54.739]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.739 --> 02:29:57.401]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:01.604 --> 02:31:05.006]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:31:05.006 --> 02:31:11.048]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:31:11.048 --> 02:31:14.930]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[02:31:14.930 --> 02:31:16.531]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[02:31:16.531 --> 02:31:20.973]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[02:32:01.097 --> 02:32:03.038]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:32:03.038 --> 02:32:05.198]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:32:05.198 --> 02:32:11.500]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:32:11.500 --> 02:32:14.961]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:32:14.961 --> 02:32:18.882]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:32:18.882 --> 02:32:20.282]  The fact is, you are.
[02:32:20.282 --> 02:32:21.302]  We all are.
[02:32:21.302 --> 02:32:23.643]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:32:23.943 --> 02:32:32.511]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[02:32:37.375 --> 02:32:39.757]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[02:32:44.322 --> 02:32:50.207]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:50.467 --> 02:32:53.168]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:24.906 --> 02:33:29.287]  We're going back to our guest Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network here in just a moment.
[02:33:29.287 --> 02:33:30.388]  Chuck in Boston.
[02:33:30.388 --> 02:33:35.709]  And you're noticing the FBI saying give us all your footage just like Oklahoma City.
[02:33:35.709 --> 02:33:37.649]  Don't give it to the media.
[02:33:37.649 --> 02:33:42.471]  But he's saying he saw cops with backpacks and that's exactly what the bombs were in.
[02:33:43.251 --> 02:33:44.411]  And again, they were running a drill.
[02:33:44.411 --> 02:33:48.472]  People saw stuff that was making them suspicious, and they'd say, it's just a drill, never mind.
[02:33:48.472 --> 02:33:51.833]  I would imagine, by the way, Sonny, can you sit on this bag for me?
[02:33:51.833 --> 02:33:52.893]  I'm an officer.
[02:33:52.893 --> 02:33:54.233]  Here's a lollipop.
[02:33:54.233 --> 02:33:55.994]  I mean, I'm telling you, that's how sick this is.
[02:33:55.994 --> 02:33:58.614]  And they could be firing who knows what.
[02:33:58.614 --> 02:34:01.515]  And it could be Islamic, could be fake, could be real.
[02:34:01.515 --> 02:34:02.915]  I mean, they're trying to blame it on the Tea Party.
[02:34:02.915 --> 02:34:07.997]  We're going back to Hagman in a minute with his connections out there on the East Coast.
[02:34:07.997 --> 02:34:09.617]  But Chuck, what did you see?
[02:34:11.718 --> 02:34:12.639]  Hi Alex.
[02:34:12.639 --> 02:34:14.762]  Yes sir, tell us what you saw.
[02:34:14.762 --> 02:34:16.044]  Yeah, I appreciate what you're doing.
[02:34:16.044 --> 02:34:17.306]  I can't talk too long.
[02:34:17.306 --> 02:34:18.708]  I got out of Boston as quick as I could.
[02:34:18.708 --> 02:34:23.114]  I was at the 13 mile marker for the race.
[02:34:23.114 --> 02:34:26.359]  I was walking from a restaurant over to meet my friend.
[02:34:28.061 --> 02:34:31.862]  I saw, what I saw was they caught my guy who was a cop and I disguised him.
[02:34:31.862 --> 02:34:33.242]  I sent the video to the UN.
[02:34:33.242 --> 02:34:34.803]  Forget the press, forget the FBI.
[02:34:34.803 --> 02:34:37.044]  I sent it to the UN.
[02:34:37.044 --> 02:34:38.244]  Whoever they are.
[02:34:38.244 --> 02:34:40.745]  The world military, whatever the hell they are.
[02:34:40.745 --> 02:34:41.845]  And I put it on YouTube.
[02:34:41.845 --> 02:34:43.905]  I disguised it.
[02:34:43.905 --> 02:34:47.566]  And the name is 9-11 Liars Club.
[02:34:47.566 --> 02:34:49.627]  I disguised it as a 9-11 video.
[02:34:49.627 --> 02:34:51.548]  Because it's all connected as conspiracies.
[02:34:51.548 --> 02:34:52.668]  Okay, okay.
[02:34:52.668 --> 02:34:55.549]  Tell me the name of the video on YouTube and we'll pull it up.
[02:34:55.549 --> 02:34:56.349]  Say it again clearly.
[02:34:57.846 --> 02:35:00.848]  9-11 Liars Club.
[02:35:00.848 --> 02:35:05.570]  I disguised it as that, but what I saw was a state trooper in his car, unmarked, he had his gun exposed to me.
[02:35:05.570 --> 02:35:07.071]  He's obviously a cop.
[02:35:07.071 --> 02:35:12.834]  And, uh, pulling it back, a knapsack, a backpack, and put it into the baby carriage, and I said, what, this ain't right!
[02:35:12.834 --> 02:35:22.199]  I zoomed in on Alex's plate and everything, and I caught him on video putting the second one in the baby carriage.
[02:35:22.199 --> 02:35:24.280]  Hey, I gotta go, I don't trust this.
[02:35:24.955 --> 02:35:33.189]  Alright, that caller sounded a little bit sarcastic, and maybe I'm wrong reading the voice, but you open the phones up, you're going to get some of that stuff.
[02:35:33.189 --> 02:35:37.315]  A lot of people that are working for The Globalist also think it's funny to make all this a joke.
[02:35:37.315 --> 02:35:39.339]  It's going to be funny when they take your private pension fund.
[02:35:40.606 --> 02:35:42.768]  Go ahead and drink that fluoride and give your kid all the shots.
[02:35:42.768 --> 02:35:44.109]  Oh, you don't do that.
[02:35:44.109 --> 02:35:45.169]  It's just for the rest of us.
[02:35:45.169 --> 02:35:46.350]  It's all a big joke.
[02:35:46.350 --> 02:35:49.733]  And maybe that guy wasn't bad, but that sounded like somebody reading a script.
[02:35:49.733 --> 02:35:53.295]  That's what Skousen said he thought was going on earlier, too.
[02:35:53.295 --> 02:35:54.937]  And if the guy's wrong, I'm wrong.
[02:35:54.937 --> 02:35:57.478]  But that sounded like it was just designed to be paranoid.
[02:35:57.478 --> 02:36:03.443]  You know, you hear these ads that I don't condone going, you better go to this site or you're basically dead.
[02:36:03.903 --> 02:36:08.465]  I'm saying we need to get informed and involved, or the evil will take over, and then we're enslaved.
[02:36:08.465 --> 02:36:11.186]  I'm not like, we're screwed, you know, get ready.
[02:36:11.186 --> 02:36:13.806]  It's like, we can turn this around.
[02:36:13.806 --> 02:36:15.587]  But a lot of callers coming in.
[02:36:15.587 --> 02:36:25.430]  We've got Trish in New York, Families Military, John in Washington Army, Bill in Indiana, Bombings Related, Dean, Army, Billy, we'll get to all of you.
[02:36:25.430 --> 02:36:30.452]  But let me just shut up so Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network can get his points out.
[02:36:30.452 --> 02:36:31.372]  What are you hearing?
[02:36:31.372 --> 02:36:32.833]  What are you seeing out of this?
[02:36:33.613 --> 02:36:36.375]  The police saying there wasn't a drill, but the drill's on record.
[02:36:36.375 --> 02:36:37.876]  What's your take on this?
[02:36:37.876 --> 02:36:39.096]  What are you hearing?
[02:36:39.096 --> 02:36:40.337]  A couple of things.
[02:36:40.337 --> 02:36:44.620]  The training drill did happen as it was initially reported.
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:51.464]  And by the way, I talked to my source from the DHS this morning and his reply to that training drill was,
[02:36:53.204 --> 02:37:10.168]  How safe does that make you feel, even if things went off exactly as the government stated, where you had a real live training drill or a real live security force there with dogs checking for explosives, finding none.
[02:37:10.168 --> 02:37:12.329]  How safe do you feel now?
[02:37:12.329 --> 02:37:14.029]  How well did that work out for you?
[02:37:14.029 --> 02:37:15.350]  That was number one.
[02:37:15.350 --> 02:37:20.931]  But more disconcerting than that, Alex, as of this morning when I talked to my source,
[02:37:21.811 --> 02:37:40.343]  He did say that this was an opening salvo of additional attacks of this nature that he classified in his terminology as a diversionary attacks, meaning false flag attacks.
[02:37:40.343 --> 02:37:43.525]  At least that's what I got out of that statement.
[02:37:43.525 --> 02:37:48.128]  So, I think what we're seeing here, based on the most current information I've got,
[02:37:49.148 --> 02:37:52.070]  This is not the end of anything.
[02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:57.873]  This is the beginning of a more deadly, perhaps, series of attacks.
[02:37:57.873 --> 02:38:15.684]  We're seeing the beginning of a, well, it could even be a Wag the Dog scenario, but a beginning of a campaign to demonize, further demonize, the conservative base, to further demonize the people that are patriots.
[02:38:16.504 --> 02:38:20.627]  And the fact that this happened on Patriot's Day should be lost on no one.
[02:38:20.627 --> 02:38:28.031]  The fact that there are other issues related to Boston and freedom should be lost on no one.
[02:38:28.031 --> 02:38:41.399]  Clearly, and again, based on my source, I think the most important, if I can say nothing else today, for today's broadcast, is expect more and look at these as diversions.
[02:38:41.399 --> 02:38:44.081]  And that's pretty frightening as far as I'm concerned.
[02:38:46.806 --> 02:38:57.575]  Well said, and I did confirm that last caller was a disinfo operative who's doing a pathetic job, by the way, what he's promoting is 421 views after a few years.
[02:38:57.575 --> 02:39:06.243]  But it shows how desperate they are that we're being swarmed by trolls online at an unprecedented level and on the videos and on air right now.
[02:39:06.243 --> 02:39:09.646]  They're very upset about the message we're putting out.
[02:39:09.646 --> 02:39:13.029]  And I know you don't like to jump the gun, Doug, but I mean, come on.
[02:39:13.852 --> 02:39:17.095]  Every TV show demonizes patriots.
[02:39:17.095 --> 02:39:20.617]  Every channel, even Fox is saying it's probably right-wingers.
[02:39:20.617 --> 02:39:27.022]  Whether it turns out to be that or not, they're now mixing Al-Qaeda and right-wingers like it's one, you know, one thing.
[02:39:27.022 --> 02:39:32.787]  And it's just pure demonization when the globalists run Al-Qaeda now.
[02:39:32.787 --> 02:39:34.328]  I mean, that's not debated.
[02:39:34.328 --> 02:39:36.410]  So what does your gut tell you this is?
[02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:39.632]  And, you know, if your source, who I've talked to, one of your sources,
[02:39:40.473 --> 02:39:47.397]  If your source, you know, says he has this information, because I have my sources as well, I mean, if we don't know who's behind it, then how do we know there's more?
[02:39:47.397 --> 02:39:49.118]  This is an opening salvo.
[02:39:49.118 --> 02:39:51.640]  Oh, no, I totally agree with you on this.
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:40:06.369]  And even if someone, for example, even if a member of Al-Qaeda, as you rightfully point out, that it's a creation of our intelligence agencies, even if that turns out to be true,
[02:40:06.989 --> 02:40:10.914]  Well, number one, how do we know there's going to be more?
[02:40:10.914 --> 02:40:11.554]  I agree with that.
[02:40:11.554 --> 02:40:20.184]  Number two, the fact that it could be al-Qaeda for the very reasons that they would state their religious reasons.
[02:40:23.968 --> 02:40:32.957]  However, it's going to be exploited to demonize the patriots, the constitutional loving people, and Christians.
[02:40:32.957 --> 02:40:35.660]  So, it really, it's almost... Exactly!
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:36.641]  It might be real!
[02:40:36.641 --> 02:40:39.263]  It might be real terrorists that came over from Mexico.
[02:40:39.263 --> 02:40:41.706]  They would cover it up and find some patriot to blame.
[02:40:42.239 --> 02:40:43.681]  Oh, exactly.
[02:40:43.681 --> 02:40:46.584]  It's almost as if the facts don't matter.
[02:40:46.584 --> 02:40:53.571]  It's almost as if everyone is saying, well, you know, it's the Patriots, it's because of this extreme
[02:40:58.493 --> 02:40:58.793]  I don't know.
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:34.251]  Well, even before the last piece of glass hit the pavement in Boston, everything we've seen is an attempt to demonize the very message of ours, the patriotic, constitutional-loving, Christian, conservative base in this country.
[02:41:34.251 --> 02:41:38.014]  So, expect more of this, and if this doesn't work,
[02:41:39.855 --> 02:41:41.576]  You know, they'll do something else.
[02:41:41.576 --> 02:41:45.659]  But we have to remember, too, we're also involved in a three-dimensional chess game here.
[02:41:45.659 --> 02:41:50.342]  We cannot look at this just merely in the context of one event.
[02:41:50.342 --> 02:41:53.824]  This happened in the context of other fights.
[02:41:53.824 --> 02:42:00.449]  Constitutional rights being eroded, the gun grab confiscation taking place, our economic
[02:42:01.505 --> 02:42:04.168]  Just devastation that we have here.
[02:42:04.168 --> 02:42:04.508]  That's right.
[02:42:04.508 --> 02:42:06.611]  It's a smoke screen from everything else they're doing.
[02:42:06.611 --> 02:42:10.315]  And meanwhile Axelrod says it's probably the Tea Party doing it.
[02:42:10.315 --> 02:42:18.204]  Weekly Standard, Young Turks, O'Reilly, Slime Bowl Matthews, all of them.
[02:42:18.204 --> 02:42:20.766]  This just goes on and on.
[02:42:20.766 --> 02:42:21.407]  Here's my point.
[02:42:21.407 --> 02:42:22.629]  This is why I said this was imminent.
[02:42:23.536 --> 02:42:30.966]  Again, every show says that patriots are going to murder you and your family and bomb public events with no evidence or history.
[02:42:30.966 --> 02:42:34.511]  Clearly, they're gearing up to do it themselves and blame it on us.
[02:42:34.511 --> 02:42:34.711]  That's 101!
[02:42:36.601 --> 02:42:37.781]  That's 101.
[02:42:37.781 --> 02:42:43.262]  And if they do try to say it's Al-Qaeda, everybody's going to point out, well, why is NATO arming Al-Qaeda then?
[02:42:43.262 --> 02:42:47.003]  So I don't see them going with that narrative.
[02:42:47.003 --> 02:42:58.905]  But I mean, maybe the public's so stupid, maybe they let Al-Qaeda in with a bunch of heat-seeking missiles, they shoot down airplanes, and then they go, oh, well, they got them in Libya, and everybody's too dumb to get to know that our government gave them to them.
[02:42:58.905 --> 02:42:59.885]  I mean, it's so simple.
[02:42:59.885 --> 02:43:03.746]  I mean, I guess the government just staged a bunch of bombings, take over.
[02:43:03.746 --> 02:43:04.686]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:43:05.202 --> 02:43:08.187]  Well, you know, I think, Alex, we're in the fight of our lives here.
[02:43:08.187 --> 02:43:10.210]  This is the end game.
[02:43:10.210 --> 02:43:13.295]  This is for all the marbles.
[02:43:13.295 --> 02:43:15.037]  Our liberties are at stake.
[02:43:15.037 --> 02:43:16.920]  Our very way of life is at stake.
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:20.306]  We're seeing the bankers rape, pillage, and plunder our bank accounts.
[02:43:20.646 --> 02:43:29.569]  That's why you're seeing hyperventilating by all of the establishment authoritarians that say they're leftist, going after the guns and everything, and saying your kids belong to the state.
[02:43:29.569 --> 02:43:33.990]  It's like they know something huge is coming, and they're licking their chops with arrogance.
[02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:44.733]  I mean, they are on real power trips, and I hope they know we got hundreds of millions of guns, we got the jump on you, we know you're a terrorist, we know who you are, we know you're scum, we know you hate us.
[02:43:44.733 --> 02:43:47.534]  I mean, I hope they understand that we know who they are.
[02:43:49.777 --> 02:43:55.183]  I think they do, which is why I think we're seeing the reactions that we're seeing.
[02:43:55.183 --> 02:44:00.329]  I think that there's, in their mind, they are not leaving anything to chance.
[02:44:00.329 --> 02:44:03.352]  There's no single point failure for them.
[02:44:05.434 --> 02:44:18.765]  So, we may see in this multi-dimensional chess game, we may see a terrorist attack like we saw yesterday, or an attack or a bombing like we saw yesterday, and then something else take place over in another part of the world.
[02:44:18.765 --> 02:44:22.609]  I mean, look, it's just like what we're seeing in North Korea.
[02:44:22.609 --> 02:44:23.389]  What's that all about?
[02:44:23.389 --> 02:44:26.752]  Well, that's just to divert our assets, military assets over there.
[02:44:26.752 --> 02:44:29.474]  Well, things can happen in the Middle East.
[02:44:29.474 --> 02:44:31.416]  You know, everything is connected here.
[02:44:31.536 --> 02:44:47.243]  I was about to say, oil, gold, Russia, Europe, China, Japan getting in fights now, North Korea, Iran, putting Al-Qaeda in charge of all these countries with Homeland Security and NATO.
[02:44:47.243 --> 02:44:50.905]  Everything is going like somebody hit the dominoes.
[02:44:50.905 --> 02:44:55.006]  Basically, somebody tripped the dominoes and the game is in play now.
[02:44:55.006 --> 02:44:56.107]  What is it building towards?
[02:44:57.341 --> 02:45:00.364]  Well, ultimately, I mean, we are a captured operation.
[02:45:00.364 --> 02:45:16.837]  When we can't even have an intelligent conversation about current events, whether it's about the pedigree of our current occupant of the White House, or about what happened in Benghazi, for example, we still haven't gotten any answers to Benghazi.
[02:45:16.837 --> 02:45:23.163]  How can we expect, how can the average American expect to get the truth on something like what happened yesterday?
[02:45:23.163 --> 02:45:23.603]  We can't.
[02:45:23.763 --> 02:45:24.844]  What's this all building to?
[02:45:24.844 --> 02:45:30.929]  This is all building to the ultimate things that you talk about, this global domination.
[02:45:30.929 --> 02:45:35.072]  It's going to be a situation where they're going to collapse our economy.
[02:45:35.072 --> 02:45:37.154]  I mean, this is how it's been told to me.
[02:45:37.154 --> 02:45:38.635]  Our economy is going to be collapsed.
[02:45:38.635 --> 02:45:44.299]  It's a deliberate economic collapse of the dollar.
[02:45:44.299 --> 02:45:46.241]  We are going to be essentially slaves.
[02:45:46.861 --> 02:45:47.221]  I think?
[02:46:05.211 --> 02:46:10.755]  To the further enslavement of not only us, but our children and our grandchildren.
[02:46:10.755 --> 02:46:12.356]  And this is for all of the marbles.
[02:46:12.356 --> 02:46:16.478]  This is for the entire power structure of the globe.
[02:46:16.478 --> 02:46:20.361]  Something happens here in the United States that further erodes our freedom.
[02:46:21.541 --> 02:46:23.523]  Uh, something happens in North Korea.
[02:46:23.523 --> 02:46:25.285]  Something happens in Syria.
[02:46:25.285 --> 02:46:27.947]  All of this is to a means to an end.
[02:46:27.947 --> 02:46:34.573]  And the end is our total and complete subjugation and enslavement to a one world global system of governance.
[02:46:34.573 --> 02:46:38.877]  Which is why they've got to get rid of... We can't have a police state and an armed citizenry.
[02:46:38.877 --> 02:46:39.957]  It just doesn't work out well.
[02:46:40.898 --> 02:46:50.881]  So, what we're seeing here are methods, are events that will result in a further gun confiscation, further erosion of liberties.
[02:46:50.881 --> 02:46:56.323]  And if, for example, Sandy Hook didn't do it, something else will.
[02:46:56.323 --> 02:46:59.964]  No single point failure on the part of those coming after us.
[02:47:00.580 --> 02:47:05.245]  Yeah, and let's not forget, they stage Fast and Furious, they do stage false flags.
[02:47:05.245 --> 02:47:07.188]  Even CBS reported they got the memos.
[02:47:07.188 --> 02:47:13.215]  They were planning to blame the Second Amendment and say, hey, your guns are causing Mexico's problems when it wasn't our guns.
[02:47:13.215 --> 02:47:15.497]  And even when they got caught, they still went forward with it.
[02:47:16.438 --> 02:47:17.840]  And, I mean, you look at Aurora.
[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:27.528]  I mean, that is open and shut, classic MKUltra, staged, drugged, you know, DARPA program, Pentagon psychiatrist over him.
[02:47:27.528 --> 02:47:35.054]  He's in a brain-man interface, machine interface program, just like Theodore Kaczynski was in MKUltra.
[02:47:35.054 --> 02:47:36.395]  That's declassified.
[02:47:36.395 --> 02:47:40.499]  But no one ever goes, gee, why was the guy from MKUltra the reported Unabomber?
[02:47:41.169 --> 02:47:48.939]  Because the truth is they just set up these drugged out mind control guys to be their cutouts, you know, to tell their radical anti-human story.
[02:47:48.939 --> 02:47:51.642]  I mean, it's just incredible how the globalists...
[02:47:53.147 --> 02:48:11.499]  Hey, look, the CIA for 30 years, I believe it was 87 different universities, millions upon millions of dollars, how many subjects were affected by this trauma-based mind control?
[02:48:11.499 --> 02:48:12.340]  We've seen this.
[02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:13.321]  It's documented.
[02:48:13.321 --> 02:48:14.481]  You've pointed this out.
[02:48:14.481 --> 02:48:19.124]  So, you know, we do have these Aurora shooters and other people.
[02:48:19.124 --> 02:48:21.466]  People think that this is conspiracy nonsense.
[02:48:21.466 --> 02:48:22.787]  I used to laugh at it and think,
[02:48:22.927 --> 02:48:24.789]  Oh my gosh, no, it can't be.
[02:48:24.789 --> 02:48:26.991]  But the documentation is out there for anyone to look at.
[02:48:26.991 --> 02:48:29.353]  But I think the important point right now is this.
[02:48:29.353 --> 02:48:34.858]  We have to realize that we're in the fight of our lives, that there are people who want to take control of us.
[02:48:34.858 --> 02:48:36.399]  This is part of their operation.
[02:48:36.399 --> 02:48:40.343]  You've got David Axelrod, and that was a great article, too, by Steve Lawson.
[02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:48.290]  David Axelrod coming out and saying, well, you know, it could very well be a dispute over tax day, referring to the bombing of yesterday.
[02:48:49.091 --> 02:48:50.132]  This is
[02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:10.430]  No, no, that's it.
[02:49:10.430 --> 02:49:12.731]  They're the ones engaged in the trauma-based mind control.
[02:49:12.731 --> 02:49:14.851]  Milking Sandy Hook.
[02:49:14.851 --> 02:49:15.691]  Milking Aurora.
[02:49:15.691 --> 02:49:20.732]  Milking this to divert us from the $85 billion a month that's transferred to offshore banks.
[02:49:20.732 --> 02:49:34.854]  And if you look at all the thousands of declassified tests, some of which had thousands of programs within them, or incidences where they would kill foster kids, veterans, troops, towns, white people, black people, they don't care.
[02:49:34.854 --> 02:49:37.135]  Of course they would stage something like this.
[02:49:37.135 --> 02:49:38.635]  Criminal globalist elements.
[02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:41.620]  Because they like doing this as well.
[02:49:41.620 --> 02:49:51.483]  And now, images of troops with machine guns everywhere, bugging their eyes out at people, as if 400 troops, checkpoints didn't stop this.
[02:49:51.483 --> 02:49:54.764]  In fact, it's probably the people running the checkpoints that brought this to you.
[02:49:54.764 --> 02:50:04.886]  I mean, it's so elementary, and I think more and more people are... Do you think it shook them up that we had a reporter take over both press conferences?
[02:50:04.886 --> 02:50:06.067]  You know what?
[02:50:06.067 --> 02:50:06.767]  I don't know anymore.
[02:50:09.688 --> 02:50:11.990]  I defer to you on that.
[02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:14.532]  I really don't know, but all I know is this.
[02:50:14.532 --> 02:50:29.624]  I think that we are the intended recipients of the shock and awe campaign, this military psyops campaign, this campaign of extreme disinformation, and disinformation is the key here.
[02:50:29.624 --> 02:50:34.968]  You've got people that are in the media that are working for the globalists.
[02:50:34.968 --> 02:50:36.429]  You've got the people that are
[02:50:40.053 --> 02:50:41.595]  Absolutely.
[02:50:41.595 --> 02:50:42.696]  We are so infiltrated.
[02:50:42.696 --> 02:50:44.498]  That's why they shut down both press conferences.
[02:50:44.498 --> 02:50:47.222]  Homelandsecurityus.com is the website.
[02:50:47.222 --> 02:50:49.004]  Homelandsecurityus.com.

[02:53:22.858 --> 02:53:23.278]  We're good.
[02:53:41.152 --> 02:53:42.532]  We will not be forgotten.
[02:53:42.532 --> 02:53:43.613]  We won't be left behind.
[02:53:43.613 --> 02:53:45.133]  Our victories live on in Fort Levine.
[02:54:17.612 --> 02:54:25.082]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[02:54:25.082 --> 02:54:26.885]  I make a living off the land.
[02:54:27.776 --> 02:54:29.557]  I ride a John Deere tractor.
[02:54:29.557 --> 02:54:30.818]  I'm a liberated man.
[02:54:30.818 --> 02:54:31.578]  I'm a liberated man.
[02:54:31.578 --> 02:54:32.779]  The rain hasn't fallen.
[02:54:32.779 --> 02:54:37.202]  The rain hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[02:54:37.202 --> 02:54:40.504]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[02:54:40.504 --> 02:54:42.025]  Bankman says he likes me.
[02:54:42.025 --> 02:54:45.387]  Bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do.
[02:54:45.387 --> 02:54:50.330]  He tells me that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too.
[02:54:50.330 --> 02:54:51.791]  He ain't my friend.
[02:54:51.791 --> 02:54:53.052]  He ain't my friend.
[02:54:53.052 --> 02:54:54.333]  And I'll ride again.
[02:54:56.474 --> 02:55:02.862]  All right, that's enough of that great highway music.
[02:55:02.862 --> 02:55:04.264]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[02:55:04.264 --> 02:55:04.804]  to 2 p.m.
[02:55:04.804 --> 02:55:10.972]  is the official transmission, but when this hour ends we will go to video and audio streams that are already up and running.
[02:55:10.972 --> 02:55:12.594]  Free for everybody at Infowars.com.
[02:55:14.292 --> 02:55:16.653]  Forward slash listen.
[02:55:16.653 --> 02:55:19.314]  And then the nightly news at 7 o'clock will be regrouped and ready.
[02:55:19.314 --> 02:55:25.197]  Then I'll do coast to coast AM tonight for three hours on the Globalist Master Takeover plan.
[02:55:25.197 --> 02:55:28.519]  But undoubtedly I'm going to be able to spend some time on this.
[02:55:28.519 --> 02:55:29.580]  We'll have more tonight.
[02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:29.860]  So that's.
[02:55:31.141 --> 02:55:38.429]  I don't know, 560 something radio stations across the country, so that'll certainly be a powerful one-two punch for coast2coastam.com.
[02:55:38.429 --> 02:55:39.911]  I want to take some phone calls right now.
[02:55:39.911 --> 02:55:46.117]  I've got some other special reports I'm going to play and a recap of all this before I throw it.
[02:55:46.758 --> 02:55:47.519]  We're good to go.
[02:56:04.830 --> 02:56:14.273]  Come on after us to take any clips from the shows or any of the feeds tonight that you feel like carrying that will be available at the free streams in even high quality.
[02:56:14.273 --> 02:56:20.274]  We also have low res as well for people who don't have good internet connections at InfoWars.com forward slash listen.
[02:56:20.274 --> 02:56:24.235]  And again, if you follow us on Twitter, you can find all that information right there.
[02:56:24.235 --> 02:56:30.797]  But I'm going to punch out for a few hours just to save my voice so I can do Coast to Coast AM tonight, because by the time I was into like
[02:56:32.078 --> 02:56:35.640]  11th hour of transmission yesterday and barking orders behind the scenes.
[02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:42.944]  I had no voice by 9 o'clock last night, but a rest will always... I can start to feel it even now.
[02:56:42.944 --> 02:56:45.306]  I'm starting to get a little bit even.
[02:56:45.306 --> 02:56:48.267]  I don't do a Clint Eastwood voice on purpose.
[02:56:48.267 --> 02:56:49.588]  Go ahead, punk.
[02:56:49.588 --> 02:56:51.809]  Make my day.
[02:56:51.809 --> 02:56:53.870]  My name's Bill Clinton.
[02:56:53.870 --> 02:56:55.411]  I didn't have sex with that lady.
[02:56:55.411 --> 02:56:56.672]  I always tell you the truth.
[02:57:01.804 --> 02:57:03.105]  And your firearms.
[02:57:03.105 --> 02:57:05.407]  It's not that I want to enslave you or anything.
[02:57:05.407 --> 02:57:07.488]  It's just that we're buying a lot more guns.
[02:57:07.488 --> 02:57:12.211]  We'd like to be the only ones that have them over at MENA at the airport where we fly the narcotics in.
[02:57:12.211 --> 02:57:15.674]  So that's basically all I wanted to say to you.
[02:57:15.674 --> 02:57:17.695]  How's that sound?
[02:57:17.695 --> 02:57:19.397]  Okay.
[02:57:19.397 --> 02:57:20.658]  Again, I know we got a bunch of callers.
[02:57:20.658 --> 02:57:25.261]  I'll get to you and then I will get to these video clips.
[02:57:25.261 --> 02:57:27.302]  But John and then
[02:57:29.972 --> 02:57:33.033]  Others that are patiently holding Trish, Bill, Dean, and Billy.
[02:57:33.033 --> 02:57:34.633]  I'll get to all of you.
[02:57:34.633 --> 02:57:38.154]  And I get a little dingy sometimes on air and make jokes because I'm tired.
[02:57:38.154 --> 02:57:42.936]  I start singing along with Willie Nelson and then everything else goes out the window.
[02:57:42.936 --> 02:57:47.657]  And we'll also review the latest up at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:57:47.657 --> 02:57:50.918]  I say that because I want to go over and see what's being covered.
[02:57:51.818 --> 02:57:54.600]  Yeah, explosives made of pressure cookers.
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:57:57.903]  Roommate speaks out about Saudi National being questioned by FBI.
[02:57:57.903 --> 02:58:05.749]  Well, if the Saudis did it, we have to spin the globe and then just randomly pick a country like Iraq and attack it.
[02:58:05.749 --> 02:58:07.990]  Maybe the Pentagon could nuke Canada.
[02:58:07.990 --> 02:58:15.136]  If Saudi Arabia is involved in this again, we'll just attack another random country like Luxembourg or something.
[02:58:15.136 --> 02:58:16.697]  Or maybe Mexico.
[02:58:18.418 --> 02:58:21.639]  Lawmakers question trusted status for Saudi travelers.
[02:58:21.639 --> 02:58:24.360]  After Boston, Congressman urges caution on immigration.
[02:58:24.360 --> 02:58:27.360]  Muslim Brotherhood leader points to conspiracy behind bombing.
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:29.441]  Two men speaking Arabic escorted off plane.
[02:58:29.441 --> 02:58:33.002]  It just goes on and on.
[02:58:33.002 --> 02:58:35.042]  Witness recount war zone at Marathon.
[02:58:35.042 --> 02:58:36.723]  Warning graphic content.
[02:58:36.723 --> 02:58:37.603]  That's some of the stuff there.
[02:58:37.603 --> 02:58:39.824]  We're covering it all at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:43.794 --> 02:58:45.740]  Infowars.com forward slash listen.
[02:58:45.740 --> 02:58:49.149]  Send that to your friends and family please.
[02:58:49.149 --> 02:58:50.734]  I believe the bankers are our friends.
[02:58:52.145 --> 02:58:53.146]  I had tried everything.
[02:58:53.146 --> 02:58:55.548]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:58:55.548 --> 02:58:58.690]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:58:58.690 --> 02:59:03.514]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[02:59:03.514 --> 02:59:10.379]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:59:10.379 --> 02:59:20.828]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:59:21.588 --> 02:59:26.049]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:59:26.049 --> 02:59:32.311]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:59:32.311 --> 02:59:33.891]  Now that's results.
[02:59:33.891 --> 02:59:40.693]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[02:59:40.693 --> 02:59:46.394]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[03:00:12.724 --> 03:00:14.265]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.265 --> 03:00:15.626]  He's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.626 --> 03:00:16.127]  Welcome back.
[03:00:16.127 --> 03:00:17.708]  On the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.708 --> 03:00:18.408]  It's 2 o'clock now.
[03:00:18.408 --> 03:00:19.349]  And natural.
[03:00:19.349 --> 03:00:22.911]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.911 --> 03:00:24.712]  Part of our continual coverage.
[03:00:24.712 --> 03:00:26.413]  Look at DrugsReport.com.
[03:00:26.413 --> 03:00:27.534]  We need more cameras.
[03:00:27.534 --> 03:00:36.040]  I remember a couple years ago, like 8, 9 years ago, they got a $2 billion Homeland Security grant to put cameras up all over Boston.
[03:00:36.740 --> 03:00:43.365]  I mean, it's the finishing line of one of the biggest sporting events in the world, and they're saying they don't have enough cameras.
[03:00:43.365 --> 03:00:54.473]  You know what we need is, if you're watching us on TV, we do not need more cameras on Representative Peter King, who looks like the Bride of Frankenstein.
[03:00:54.473 --> 03:01:01.578]  He looks like a pasty, like something out of Hellraiser.
[03:01:01.578 --> 03:01:03.940]  Like you put him in a leather outfit with like a big zipper.
[03:01:05.521 --> 03:01:06.802]  Uh, you know, down the front of him.
[03:01:06.802 --> 03:01:10.226]  And that's a Hellraiser creature right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:10.226 --> 03:01:11.067]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[03:01:11.067 --> 03:01:13.029]  It looks like he's been to hell, too.
[03:01:13.029 --> 03:01:14.050]  Look at those eyes.
[03:01:14.050 --> 03:01:15.172]  Shark eyes.
[03:01:15.172 --> 03:01:16.834]  One-way eyes.
[03:01:16.834 --> 03:01:17.755]  Like there's nothing behind it.
[03:01:20.765 --> 03:01:28.334]  Peter King, who by the way wants your guns, but he's a good Republican, he gets to keep his bodyguards.
[03:01:28.334 --> 03:01:31.177]  Hey buddy, why don't you move to North Korea?
[03:01:31.177 --> 03:01:32.799]  How's that sound?
[03:01:32.799 --> 03:01:36.302]  And there's all sorts of jitters, LaGuardia Terminal evacuated over a suspicious package.
[03:01:36.302 --> 03:01:37.964]  But meanwhile the borders are wide open.
[03:01:42.376 --> 03:01:43.836]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[03:01:43.836 --> 03:01:44.397]  First time caller.
[03:01:44.397 --> 03:01:46.657]  I've been listening to your show for a little while now.
[03:01:46.657 --> 03:01:47.958]  You've got a great show, man.
[03:02:05.581 --> 03:02:32.944]  I've served in the Army for over 20 years and I can tell you that from my experience, I go back to 1995 to 1997 is the first time I served in Saudi Arabia and we were doing anti-terrorism training then, counter-terrorism training and since then I've been to a few more courses throughout the world, a couple places that I really can't talk about but when Iraq broke off and the first time I saw a
[03:02:34.062 --> 03:02:34.222]  No, no.
[03:02:44.210 --> 03:02:57.733]  In Saudi Arabia, you know, it was right around the Cobar Tower bombing, because there was a bombing in November 2003, I mean, in November of 95, in Riyadh, it was a car bomb.
[03:02:57.733 --> 03:03:07.355]  And then it was unsuccessful, and then in 96 is when, you know, the Cobar Towers blew up and, you know, skyrocketed, all of the anti-terrorism training just went up from there.
[03:03:07.355 --> 03:03:10.536]  But I can tell you that everything that we do,
[03:03:11.790 --> 03:03:13.552]  It leads up to a training event.
[03:03:13.552 --> 03:03:17.897]  And these training events culminate with some kind of joint task force training.
[03:03:17.897 --> 03:03:20.880]  And if you look right now, I think that's what's happening.
[03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:23.103]  You know, I think you put your finger right on it.
[03:03:23.103 --> 03:03:27.488]  You got joint exercises going on all around the world.
[03:03:30.134 --> 03:03:44.553]  Yeah, so they integrate the military in with the police, they start federalizing the police, the special event police, then the general police, you standardize the codes, the cars, the equipment, the training, and you have total federalization, and the feds themselves are globalist.
[03:03:45.174 --> 03:03:47.475]  And so it's full globalization.
[03:03:47.475 --> 03:04:00.759]  It's UN, UNESCO policy, right through the federal government, into a new hyper-afraid nanny state, surveilling everyone and disappearing people off into government spider holes.
[03:04:00.759 --> 03:04:01.799]  Ultra creepy.
[03:04:01.799 --> 03:04:03.560]  Homeland Security, though, has a new website.
[03:04:03.560 --> 03:04:12.062]  Learn how DHS helps keep our nation safe by putting Al Qaeda in charge in Libya and Syria, and GOP moves to prop up Obamacare.
[03:04:12.062 --> 03:04:13.403]  Of course, the big banks wrote it.
[03:04:14.443 --> 03:04:19.388]  Well, there's a lot of people in the military that I know, friends of mine, that, you know, they don't
[03:04:37.796 --> 03:04:41.179]  You know, they don't buy into all of the, you know, the BS that goes on.
[03:04:41.179 --> 03:04:42.760]  I mean, you see it every day.
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:46.003]  I mean, we've been through numerous joint training exercises.
[03:04:46.003 --> 03:04:49.526]  And, I mean, we even train ourselves to act like the Paris.
[03:04:49.526 --> 03:04:51.848]  So, like, you got, you got opposing forces.
[03:04:51.848 --> 03:04:57.392]  You got your OPFOR that acts just like the Paris element, you know, along with, you know... No, stay there.
[03:04:57.392 --> 03:04:58.333]  I want to hear more about this.
[03:04:58.333 --> 03:04:59.114]  I've got other callers.
[03:05:01.829 --> 03:05:03.730]  Introducing Pro-1.

[03:05:18.039 --> 03:05:28.825]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[03:05:29.005 --> 03:05:35.507]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[03:05:35.507 --> 03:05:50.233]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,

[03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:03.472]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[03:07:03.472 --> 03:07:10.098]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them, if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[03:07:10.098 --> 03:07:18.625]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[03:07:18.625 --> 03:07:23.409]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[03:07:23.409 --> 03:07:27.232]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[03:07:27.512 --> 03:07:30.073]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids.
[03:07:30.073 --> 03:07:35.657]  And all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[03:07:35.657 --> 03:07:39.559]  With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[03:07:39.559 --> 03:07:40.599]  My name is Daniel.
[03:07:40.599 --> 03:07:41.800]  I'm 34 years old.
[03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:45.762]  When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[03:07:45.762 --> 03:07:48.604]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[03:07:48.604 --> 03:07:50.745]  This is my ideal weight.
[03:07:50.745 --> 03:07:55.407]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[03:07:57.028 --> 03:08:07.754]  Big Brother.
[03:08:07.754 --> 03:08:09.535]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.535 --> 03:08:11.276]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.276 --> 03:08:12.857]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.857 --> 03:08:14.438]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.438 --> 03:08:18.621]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.621 --> 03:08:22.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:41.520 --> 03:08:51.929]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got the reporters coming in and I was just talking to Leanne McAdoo, who's going to be in here with Jakari Jackson and David Knight.
[03:08:51.929 --> 03:08:58.555]  She was talking about trolls and the standard deal they do in the YouTube videos, going, don't you care about the people?
[03:08:58.555 --> 03:09:00.657]  Yeah, I care about the million dead Iraqis.
[03:09:00.657 --> 03:09:02.819]  I care about the hundreds of thousands that die from bad drug,
[03:09:05.101 --> 03:09:12.124]  I care about the kids dying from deadly vaccines by the thousands and hundreds of thousands being injured.
[03:09:12.124 --> 03:09:15.686]  Autism going from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50-something.
[03:09:15.686 --> 03:09:18.187]  That's a troll thing they do.
[03:09:18.187 --> 03:09:25.491]  That, oh, give this time with a tragedy for us to find out what really happened.
[03:09:25.491 --> 03:09:27.152]  Don't talk about the drill.
[03:09:27.152 --> 03:09:31.194]  Hey, the police are mourning what Dorner did to them.
[03:09:31.194 --> 03:09:33.315]  Don't talk about how they claim they burned him down.
[03:09:33.735 --> 03:09:34.576]  Don't look at that.
[03:09:34.576 --> 03:09:38.498]  They don't want us up front addressing the information.
[03:09:38.498 --> 03:09:46.242]  I've never seen trolls going this wild on this many fronts.
[03:09:46.242 --> 03:09:50.324]  I've never seen anything like it in my life.
[03:09:50.324 --> 03:09:52.566]  And this is the type of stuff getting posted up to Reddit.
[03:09:53.506 --> 03:09:56.528]  And whether it's real or not, this is exactly what you could expect to see.
[03:09:56.528 --> 03:10:10.798]  So if this is real, I'll read this now before we go back to the calls, John and others, so that if it unfolds, I work on a security commission and I've just received word to start campaigning on a campaign we've been working on the last two months and now it all makes sense.
[03:10:10.798 --> 03:10:13.619]  I'll keep it as short as I can.
[03:10:13.619 --> 03:10:21.725]  They're going to pin this event on a male, late teens to early twenties, and I'd say he did it because he's unstable.
[03:10:24.099 --> 03:10:24.859]  And say he did it.
[03:10:24.859 --> 03:10:25.660]  He wouldn't say that.
[03:10:25.660 --> 03:10:27.721]  And they say he did it because he's unstable.
[03:10:27.721 --> 03:10:30.583]  They're going to find firearms and an NRA book in his home.
[03:10:30.583 --> 03:10:32.964]  They're going to say he used reloading powder.
[03:10:32.964 --> 03:10:35.025]  Yeah, I was thinking that too, to then ban that.
[03:10:35.025 --> 03:10:35.866]  For the explosion.
[03:10:35.866 --> 03:10:38.647]  And that reloading powder shouldn't be for sale to the public.
[03:10:38.647 --> 03:10:39.048]  Absolutely.
[03:10:39.048 --> 03:10:40.448]  That shuts down reloading.
[03:10:40.448 --> 03:10:41.749]  It's about going after the bullets.
[03:10:41.749 --> 03:10:47.893]  They're going to use this to say that because the powder in ammunition can be used for explosions,
[03:10:48.593 --> 03:10:55.418]  Uh, the number of rounds you can buy should be limited and taxed to help pay for these events.
[03:10:55.418 --> 03:10:59.462]  I can't do anything or I'll lose my job, possibly face criminal charges.
[03:10:59.462 --> 03:11:01.283]  Please don't let them get away with it.
[03:11:01.283 --> 03:11:06.347]  They won't find the suspect till later this week, and the raid is to occur on Friday.
[03:11:06.347 --> 03:11:07.408]  This was a staged event.
[03:11:07.408 --> 03:11:10.270]  The people hurt are real, but the event was planned.
[03:11:10.270 --> 03:11:12.011]  Don't let them hurt our rights.
[03:11:12.011 --> 03:11:17.035]  I'm going to use a copy of a picture from another thread, so please don't mention me.
[03:11:17.035 --> 03:11:18.056]  It will seriously hurt me.
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:23.184]  Now, again, is that somebody trying to warn folks, or is that fake?
[03:11:23.184 --> 03:11:34.934]  Folks, all I know is, every show said, prepare for veterans to attack, prepare for Christians to attack, the Tea Party's gonna blow you up, the Tea Party's gonna shoot you, blah, blah, blah, and now this happens.
[03:11:34.934 --> 03:11:36.216]  I mean, this is incredible.
[03:11:36.216 --> 03:11:38.798]  And now they try to deny this drill was happening.
[03:11:38.798 --> 03:11:42.481]  John, in the Army, Washington, what is your take on this, sir?
[03:11:42.481 --> 03:11:43.943]  In closing, what is your take on this?
[03:11:45.680 --> 03:11:50.743]  Well, you know, I just see this as a joint terrorism task force training exercise.
[03:11:50.743 --> 03:11:51.984]  It kind of looks that way to me.
[03:11:51.984 --> 03:11:56.226]  You know, all of these guys are, you know, in place, the commonalities behind them.
[03:11:56.226 --> 03:12:10.013]  I know they're there because it's a big event, but I mean, with the excess amount of people that they have on the ground, and immediately they jump into this task force and have everybody ready to go, it just seemed to me, it seemed kind of staged.
[03:12:10.013 --> 03:12:11.194]  That's all I know.
[03:12:11.194 --> 03:12:14.156]  It seems like a real tragedy, a terrorist attack.
[03:12:14.796 --> 03:12:20.142]  But, you know, where exactly it's coming from, I mean, I don't know for sure.
[03:12:35.140 --> 03:12:36.801]  I mean, I've never seen such a build-up.
[03:12:36.801 --> 03:12:38.522]  I mean, this is all scripted.
[03:12:38.522 --> 03:12:43.926]  The bomb robots delivered everywhere the last year, the body scanners delivered right as the underwear bombing happens.
[03:12:43.926 --> 03:12:45.527]  I mean, it's all scripted.
[03:12:46.523 --> 03:12:52.748]  And we'll see who they blame it on, but they're already saying right-wing Al-Qaeda, right-wing, who will it be, right-winger Al-Qaeda?
[03:12:52.748 --> 03:12:55.370]  Not, hey, are the Weathermen back to something?
[03:12:55.370 --> 03:12:56.631]  No, it's none of that.
[03:12:56.631 --> 03:13:00.574]  It's just this thing to hang it out there so they can project it onto whoever they want.
[03:13:00.574 --> 03:13:02.856]  I appreciate your call, John.
[03:13:02.856 --> 03:13:04.477]  Dean in Pennsylvania, Army.
[03:13:04.477 --> 03:13:05.558]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:13:06.834 --> 03:13:09.255]  Hey Alex, I'm not in the Army now.
[03:13:09.255 --> 03:13:11.676]  I served from 1989 to 1993.
[03:13:11.676 --> 03:13:19.920]  My unit was Alpha Company, 313th Military Intelligence Battalion of the 82nd Airborne.
[03:13:19.920 --> 03:13:28.364]  And I wanted to back up what Mr. Skousen was saying about lower-level people knowing intelligence and what's going on.
[03:13:28.364 --> 03:13:30.925]  You do not know.
[03:13:30.925 --> 03:13:35.348]  We had what was called CW, Warrant Officers, that were
[03:13:36.448 --> 03:13:40.671]  Specialists in their field, which would be interrogation and things like that.
[03:13:40.671 --> 03:13:44.414]  My battalion was what we call the Seaweed Battalion.
[03:13:44.414 --> 03:13:48.617]  It was a combat electronic warfare intelligence.
[03:13:48.617 --> 03:13:54.102]  And like you described very well, it is compartmentalized.
[03:13:54.102 --> 03:14:00.226]  There are certain positions like, I'll give you an example, our S3, which was our S3 air.
[03:14:02.315 --> 03:14:07.881]  The person sitting behind that desk had to be an E7 or above.
[03:14:07.881 --> 03:14:12.626]  Just to be in that battalion, you had to have a top-secret clearance.
[03:14:12.626 --> 03:14:18.492]  For God's sake, I had an underage drinking when I was like 19 years old.
[03:14:18.492 --> 03:14:24.899]  I was held in limbo for two weeks just to get in that battalion so the FBI could run checks on me.
[03:14:25.626 --> 03:14:29.327]  It is not, you are not privy to that information.
[03:14:29.327 --> 03:14:33.589]  And I can't see it being changed that much.
[03:14:33.589 --> 03:14:43.913]  As a matter of fact, I would think it would be more stringent nowadays with everything else going on, especially like with Manning and things like that.
[03:14:43.913 --> 03:14:48.454]  It just don't happen.
[03:14:48.454 --> 03:14:52.776]  And I'll tell you what, in a battalion or anything like that,
[03:14:54.329 --> 03:14:55.750]  It's just like high school.
[03:14:55.750 --> 03:15:00.832]  I mean, rumor mills, roles, um... Absolutely, no, no, that's what's going on.
[03:15:00.832 --> 03:15:09.776]  Troops, when they're out there with role players, screaming, I'm an American, please don't put me in the camp, don't take my guns, I'll talk to the Marines and they go, we don't know who we're training to fight.
[03:15:09.776 --> 03:15:13.457]  And I'm like, you're training to fight Americans, and they don't even know that.
[03:15:13.457 --> 03:15:14.718]  They don't tell us.
[03:15:14.718 --> 03:15:16.659]  It's just the Green Force, we're the Red Force.
[03:15:17.543 --> 03:15:19.625]  And absolutely.
[03:15:19.625 --> 03:15:23.549]  People inside, it's not like James Bond who knows everything.
[03:15:23.549 --> 03:15:25.450]  It's the complete opposite.
[03:15:25.450 --> 03:15:30.615]  And then you'll have like two guys inserted, that's why they do the drill, who are deep cover in there.
[03:15:30.615 --> 03:15:32.917]  They plant the bombs and they get out.
[03:15:32.917 --> 03:15:36.720]  They bring the patsy with them who's part of the drill so they can later set him up.
[03:15:36.720 --> 03:15:38.242]  We just know from past operations.
[03:15:38.242 --> 03:15:40.304]  Good to hear from you, Dean.
[03:15:40.304 --> 03:15:41.725]  Let's go ahead and talk to Logan.
[03:15:43.747 --> 03:15:44.347]  No, no, no.
[03:15:44.347 --> 03:15:46.108]  Logan just got on.
[03:15:46.108 --> 03:15:48.448]  Let me go to whoever's been on the longest.
[03:15:48.448 --> 03:15:50.269]  Bill in Indiana.
[03:15:50.269 --> 03:15:50.569]  Go ahead.
[03:15:50.569 --> 03:15:52.069]  You're on the air.
[03:15:52.069 --> 03:15:52.529]  Yes.
[03:15:52.529 --> 03:15:53.869]  Hello?
[03:15:53.869 --> 03:15:54.209]  I'm good.
[03:15:54.209 --> 03:15:54.750]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:15:54.750 --> 03:15:54.910]  Yeah.
[03:15:54.910 --> 03:15:59.110]  Yes, I was just calling to talk to you about what's going on.
[03:15:59.110 --> 03:16:00.811]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:16:00.811 --> 03:16:05.492]  Has anybody thought of any kind of... Is this on the radio?
[03:16:05.492 --> 03:16:06.772]  Yeah, we're on the radio.
[03:16:06.772 --> 03:16:07.332]  You called in.
[03:16:07.332 --> 03:16:09.953]  We don't screen calls, so you're on the air right now, Bill.
[03:16:11.084 --> 03:16:14.806]  I want you to look at a 47-year pattern that they're running on us.
[03:16:14.806 --> 03:16:22.930]  And if you do that, you'll go back to 66, to 1919, to 1872.
[03:16:22.930 --> 03:16:29.234]  Every 47 years, look at the history of them years and see what happened yesterday.
[03:16:29.234 --> 03:16:37.598]  In 1919, they had the Red Scare riots.
[03:16:37.598 --> 03:16:38.979]  Hello?
[03:16:38.979 --> 03:16:40.000]  I'm trying to let you talk, yeah?
[03:16:40.959 --> 03:16:43.660]  I was... I'm not a good talker.
[03:16:43.660 --> 03:16:44.880]  No, you're doing good, bro.
[03:16:44.880 --> 03:16:47.101]  I just want you to be able to make your points.
[03:16:47.101 --> 03:16:49.062]  Okay, I think they're running two patterns on us.
[03:16:49.062 --> 03:16:51.242]  The 47-year pattern and a 33.
[03:16:51.242 --> 03:16:54.964]  A 33 will bring us back to 80, and then the 47.
[03:16:54.964 --> 03:16:56.864]  Look at those magic years.
[03:16:56.864 --> 03:16:59.445]  And then 1914 before that.
[03:16:59.445 --> 03:16:59.925]  I hear you.
[03:16:59.925 --> 03:17:00.846]  Very, very interesting.
[03:17:00.846 --> 03:17:02.326]  Send me an email with more information.
[03:17:02.326 --> 03:17:05.807]  Now, let's talk to Trish in New York, who's got a family in the military.
[03:17:05.807 --> 03:17:07.228]  What's your take on all this, Trish?
[03:17:08.351 --> 03:17:21.834]  Well, I'm just curious about what you said earlier, because it seems like there needs to be more awareness of how interrelated what's going on in the Middle East is with what's going on here.
[03:17:21.834 --> 03:17:25.215]  And you brought that to the program.
[03:17:25.215 --> 03:17:26.396]  I'm really grateful for that.
[03:17:26.396 --> 03:17:34.858]  But I don't know if you're aware, but Huffington Post is now running a story about the Al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.
[03:17:35.814 --> 03:17:41.260]  That has made a comment praising the bombings.
[03:17:41.260 --> 03:17:46.165]  And he's a guy from a Salafi group in Jordan.
[03:17:46.165 --> 03:17:50.269]  Which, by the way, we're fully funding on the Globalist Star to invade all these countries.
[03:17:50.269 --> 03:17:54.233]  So, I mean, if they go with that route, again, they've already tried to tie right-wing to it.
[03:17:54.233 --> 03:17:57.817]  Is it right-wing or is it Al-Qaeda implying right-wing is the new Al-Qaeda?
[03:17:58.477 --> 03:17:59.378]  Uh, so we don't know.
[03:17:59.378 --> 03:18:03.641]  They're going to build up the crescendo before they roll out, but it just has all the signs.
[03:18:03.641 --> 03:18:12.248]  I mean, does everybody get my point about how every TV show says the Patriots are going to blow everything up now, and Green Lantern fights the militia, and the militia's going to blow up the football game?
[03:18:12.248 --> 03:18:15.351]  I mean, they do this before they stage it and blame it on us.
[03:18:16.800 --> 03:18:29.726]  I don't think they're going to be able to get away with that just on its own, but if they tie together a right-winger to Al-Qaeda, you know, that might make the dimension big enough.
[03:18:29.726 --> 03:18:38.949]  I mean, what you mentioned before about the Oklahoma City bombing, I've been working also as a freelance journalist for the last decade.
[03:18:40.510 --> 03:18:40.610]  Yes.
[03:18:40.610 --> 03:18:40.690]  Yes.
[03:18:58.683 --> 03:18:59.223]  I don't know.
[03:19:14.059 --> 03:19:36.915]  He made the claim and gave various substantiating evidence that he was having this mad affair with this woman and had I ever heard of her and at the time I didn't until later I researched and it turned out he gave me the name and the photo and it didn't mean anything to me at the time and it turns out it was Carol Howe from the Oklahoma City bombing.
[03:19:37.795 --> 03:19:49.486]  And that she had been over in Beirut, he claimed, for the nine months up until Hariri was killed and, like, a few days before the car bombing there, she disappeared like he never heard from since then.
[03:19:49.486 --> 03:19:54.250]  And it was Carol Howell who exposed Southern Property Law Center was involved in Oklahoma City and they tried to put her in prison.
[03:19:54.250 --> 03:19:54.931]  Very interesting.
[03:19:54.931 --> 03:19:56.652]  I think I remember reading about these connections before.
[03:19:56.652 --> 03:19:58.234]  You ought to write an article up about that.
[03:19:58.234 --> 03:20:00.276]  Okay, we got the other crew coming in here.
[03:20:00.276 --> 03:20:01.457]  We got nightly news tonight.
[03:20:01.957 --> 03:20:03.918]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[03:20:03.918 --> 03:20:06.600]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[03:20:06.600 --> 03:20:12.043]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[03:20:12.043 --> 03:20:15.746]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[03:20:15.746 --> 03:20:19.648]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[03:20:19.648 --> 03:20:21.029]  The fact is, you are.
[03:20:21.029 --> 03:20:22.049]  We all are.
[03:20:22.049 --> 03:20:24.371]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[03:20:24.671 --> 03:20:33.177]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[03:20:33.177 --> 03:20:34.558]  Be prepared before you need it.
[03:20:34.558 --> 03:20:38.000]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:40.362]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[03:20:56.391 --> 03:21:04.113]  What's safer and cheaper than prescription drugs?
[03:21:04.113 --> 03:21:05.353]  Glad you asked.
[03:21:05.353 --> 03:21:07.714]  The answer is renovation teas.
[03:21:07.714 --> 03:21:11.935]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.
[03:21:11.935 --> 03:21:16.196]  Taste great and most importantly herbal teas are effective and non-addictive.
[03:21:16.196 --> 03:21:18.176]  Renovation tea is especially unique
[03:21:18.456 --> 03:21:19.437]  And here's why.
[03:21:19.437 --> 03:21:23.219]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.
[03:21:23.219 --> 03:21:27.882]  Renovation Teas uses only 100% organic, fair trade herbs.
[03:21:27.882 --> 03:21:36.928]  Our teas are blended towards specific ailments and health conditions, such as diabetes, blood pressure, anxiety, libido, detox, and much more.

[03:21:40.771 --> 03:21:44.332]  Take care of yourself naturally, the way Mother Nature intended.

[03:21:51.353 --> 03:21:56.115]  That's 870-784-3121.
[03:21:56.115 --> 03:21:57.495]  Renovation Tees.

[03:22:02.496 --> 03:22:06.157]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.

[03:22:30.578 --> 03:22:31.819]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:31.819 --> 03:22:36.402]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:22:36.402 --> 03:22:42.206]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:22:42.206 --> 03:22:45.848]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:22:45.848 --> 03:22:48.670]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:48.670 --> 03:22:53.613]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:22:53.613 --> 03:22:53.874]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:53.874 --> 03:22:55.255]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.658 --> 03:23:05.819]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[03:23:05.819 --> 03:23:09.320]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[03:23:09.320 --> 03:23:15.462]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[03:23:15.462 --> 03:23:27.365]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[03:23:27.705 --> 03:23:32.268]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[03:23:32.268 --> 03:23:34.069]  And they're so easy to use.
[03:23:34.069 --> 03:23:36.270]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[03:23:36.270 --> 03:23:39.992]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[03:23:39.992 --> 03:23:43.534]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.
[03:23:43.534 --> 03:23:46.516]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[03:23:50.478 --> 03:23:51.379]  That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.
[03:23:51.379 --> 03:23:52.319]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[03:24:20.433 --> 03:24:22.914]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[03:24:22.914 --> 03:24:25.076]  We are in the Overdrive segment.
[03:24:25.076 --> 03:24:26.017]  I'm not Alex Jones.
[03:24:26.017 --> 03:24:28.198]  I'm Ja'Kari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:24:28.198 --> 03:24:29.719]  Alex is taking a break.
[03:24:29.719 --> 03:24:36.044]  And in this Overdrive segment, we will be joined by David Knight and Leanne McAdoo, one of our new reporters here in the InfoWars.
[03:24:36.044 --> 03:24:40.447]  But first, I just want to recap some of our new viewers who just may be joining us.
[03:24:40.447 --> 03:24:45.171]  One of our reporters, Dan Badandi, up in the Northeast, had a chance to go to a couple conferences.
[03:24:47.032 --> 03:24:50.554]  I do believe we have a couple of those clips.
[03:24:50.554 --> 03:24:52.115]  You guys let me know when you're ready.
[03:24:52.115 --> 03:25:07.226]  In this first clip, I believe the one that's a minute oh six, Dan confronts the mayor or governor, should I say, to ask about some of the things that's going on in the city, asking about drills or excuse me, the police commissioner to ask about the things that are going on in the city.
[03:25:07.226 --> 03:25:08.307]  Are there bomb drills?
[03:25:08.307 --> 03:25:09.808]  Were there bomb sniffing dogs?
[03:25:09.808 --> 03:25:13.330]  And if there were bomb sniffing dogs, why weren't any bombs recovered?
[03:25:13.330 --> 03:25:14.351]  I do believe we have that clip.
[03:25:14.351 --> 03:25:15.232]  So let's go ahead with that.
[03:25:15.452 --> 03:25:16.753]  Do I have to take any questions?
[03:25:16.753 --> 03:25:16.813]  No.
[03:25:29.431 --> 03:25:31.534]  Next question.
[03:25:31.534 --> 03:25:34.278]  The medical people are compiling that as we speak.
[03:25:34.278 --> 03:25:36.141]  Main point of focus right now.
[03:25:45.762 --> 03:25:48.765]  We're actually working very closely with the families right now.
[03:25:48.765 --> 03:25:50.207]  We're going through those right now.
[03:26:04.563 --> 03:26:07.166]  This is Pears Morgan Live.
[03:26:07.166 --> 03:26:11.169]  I want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world.
[03:26:20.578 --> 03:26:24.161]  Okay, and that goes into the Pierce Morgan clip after that.
[03:26:24.161 --> 03:26:26.543]  But some very real general questions.
[03:26:26.543 --> 03:26:27.825]  Were there bomb sniffing dogs?
[03:26:27.825 --> 03:26:28.725]  Were there bomb drills?
[03:26:28.725 --> 03:26:35.151]  We've heard a coach of one of the runners say that he was told that they were running drills and actually saw them himself.
[03:26:35.151 --> 03:26:38.334]  We've heard people say that they saw some other fishy things going on.
[03:26:38.334 --> 03:26:41.517]  We've seen the cherry picker photo of the man that's on the roof.
[03:26:42.938 --> 03:26:44.658]  I'll just talk for a second about the man on the roof.
[03:26:44.658 --> 03:26:48.599]  The thing that really surprised me was this lone individual on the roof.
[03:26:48.599 --> 03:26:58.321]  I know many times there are sporting events and people who live in the local area, live around the track or the football field or whatever it may be, just watch from their homes.
[03:26:58.321 --> 03:27:04.682]  If they have an apartment complex or something that they can get on top of, they'll often go to the top of the roof and watch the event.
[03:27:04.682 --> 03:27:08.363]  So I thought it was very suspect that there was only one person up on the roof as if
[03:27:08.863 --> 03:27:12.444]  Maybe the roofs were off-limit for some reason.
[03:27:12.444 --> 03:27:17.706]  I thought that was very suspicious and we'll have David Knight in in a little bit just to talk about that.
[03:27:17.706 --> 03:27:21.308]  But in the meantime I'll go through some of the news in Alex's stack.
[03:27:21.308 --> 03:27:24.829]  Person briefed on pro-bombs and pressure cookers.
[03:27:24.829 --> 03:27:26.689]  Now this is from the AAP.
[03:27:26.689 --> 03:27:33.272]  A person briefed on the Boston Marathon investigation says that the explosives were a six liter pressure cooker
[03:27:34.264 --> 03:27:36.347]  ...placed in black duffel bags.
[03:27:36.347 --> 03:27:42.096]  The person says the explosives were placed on the ground and contained shards of metal, nails, and ball bearings.
[03:27:42.096 --> 03:27:46.262]  The person spoke on the condition of an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an
[03:27:47.068 --> 03:27:49.569]  Because of the investigation is ongoing.
[03:27:49.569 --> 03:27:58.814]  So we saw the FBI earlier this morning hold a press conference and in the press conference they said they were very confident that they had secured all the explosives.
[03:27:58.814 --> 03:28:03.336]  The investigation is obviously still ongoing for a suspect or suspects.
[03:28:03.336 --> 03:28:16.503]  The earlier reports we heard about a Saudi national being the suspect was later overturned saying I'm not exactly sure why they chose to single out that individual but he has been cleared of the charges from what I am told.
[03:28:17.004 --> 03:28:17.987]  So it's a very, uh...
[03:28:19.537 --> 03:28:22.718]  Very hard thing for us in this country at this time.
[03:28:22.718 --> 03:28:27.861]  We see, you know, just recently Sandy Hook, and now we have this new tragedy in Boston.
[03:28:27.861 --> 03:28:39.065]  And regardless if it was a false flag or, you know, lone gunman or group with their particular interests, it's always going to be used not to let a good crisis go to waste.
[03:28:39.065 --> 03:28:47.409]  They're going to find some way to push their new agenda, to push out the new TSA rollouts, to push out the whatever, the XYZ, you know, the new thing that they want to test.
[03:28:48.289 --> 03:28:51.272]  And I think it's definitely forthcoming.
[03:28:51.272 --> 03:28:52.873]  We already see the TSA Viper teams.
[03:28:52.873 --> 03:28:56.135]  We see the TSA at football games, at whatever else.
[03:28:56.135 --> 03:28:58.658]  I think they were at a Romney event last year.
[03:28:58.658 --> 03:29:03.001]  I don't know why they'd be at a Romney event, but they were there checking people's bags.
[03:29:03.001 --> 03:29:04.923]  They were at the Obama inauguration.
[03:29:05.583 --> 03:29:09.104]  Testing people, checking people's bags, patting people down.
[03:29:09.104 --> 03:29:14.066]  And it's definitely more the police state that we've been warning about here on the InfoWars for a good time.
[03:29:14.066 --> 03:29:18.567]  And you can see the quote right there if you're watching on InfoWars.com forward slash listen.
[03:29:18.567 --> 03:29:20.487]  No crisis should go to waste.
[03:29:20.487 --> 03:29:22.748]  That is from Rahm Emanuel.
[03:29:22.748 --> 03:29:24.008]  And I do believe we have a break.
[03:29:24.008 --> 03:29:25.289]  So stay tuned.
[03:29:25.289 --> 03:29:28.770]  We'll be right back after this break with Leanne McAdoo and after that, David Knight.
[03:29:51.141 --> 03:29:55.065]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.065 --> 03:29:57.748]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.111 --> 03:30:03.553]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:03.553 --> 03:30:14.207]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.

[03:30:17.091 --> 03:30:18.653]  against the technocrats.
[03:30:18.653 --> 03:30:21.396]  But we can't do that without your help.

[03:30:42.333 --> 03:30:52.199]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:30:52.199 --> 03:30:53.700]  The war is here.
[03:30:53.700 --> 03:30:55.601]  It's an info war.
[03:30:55.601 --> 03:30:57.362]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:31:03.959 --> 03:31:06.039]  Are you still a traditional smoker?

[03:32:06.277 --> 03:32:09.299]  I want you to know some very important information.
[03:32:09.299 --> 03:32:17.624]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[03:32:18.257 --> 03:32:23.822]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[03:33:15.279 --> 03:33:17.161]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.161 --> 03:33:19.182]  I'm Jakari Jackson filling in for Alex.
[03:33:19.182 --> 03:33:21.084]  I'm joined here with David Knight.
[03:33:21.084 --> 03:33:21.864]  How you doing, David?
[03:33:21.864 --> 03:33:22.825]  Doing good, Jakari.
[03:33:22.825 --> 03:33:26.028]  Alright, now there is an article on InfoWars.com.
[03:33:26.028 --> 03:33:28.449]  It was just on a second ago, if you guys can put that back on.
[03:33:28.449 --> 03:33:32.553]  The Paul Joseph Watson article concerning an episode of Family Guy.
[03:33:32.553 --> 03:33:38.357]  And we get people who comment and say, why do you guys reference a cartoon or a video game or whatever else?
[03:33:38.357 --> 03:33:41.420]  Now this particular episode of Family Guy, I believe it's called
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:43.801]  Was it Cowboys?
[03:33:43.801 --> 03:33:44.941]  Turban Cowboys.
[03:33:44.941 --> 03:33:46.442]  Turban Cowboys.
[03:33:46.442 --> 03:33:54.866]  And in this episode, a family guy, the father, Peter Griffin, is a participant in the Boston Marathon.
[03:33:54.866 --> 03:33:58.488]  And it just so happens that two bombs go off in the marathon.
[03:33:58.488 --> 03:34:01.970]  So I do believe we have that clip ready to roll with.
[03:34:01.970 --> 03:34:05.291]  I'm Bob Costas here with Boston Marathon winner Peter Griffin.
[03:34:05.291 --> 03:34:06.532]  Peter, how did you do it?
[03:34:09.841 --> 03:34:11.066]  Damn phone's busted.
[03:34:11.066 --> 03:34:11.869]  Maybe I dialed wrong.
[03:34:16.001 --> 03:34:17.882]  So you just saw the clip right there.
[03:34:17.882 --> 03:34:21.285]  Now Paul Joseph Watson, I did an article and even a video accompanying that.
[03:34:21.285 --> 03:34:22.626]  His video has been taken down.
[03:34:22.626 --> 03:34:27.449]  You can see it right there on the screen if you're watching on Infowars.com forward slash listen.
[03:34:27.449 --> 03:34:30.231]  The video has been removed as you saw just a second ago.
[03:34:30.231 --> 03:34:32.192]  It is a very short clip.
[03:34:32.192 --> 03:34:37.376]  So I'm not sure what type of copyright infringements may be on that, but it has been taken down.
[03:34:37.376 --> 03:34:42.940]  That was only about 14 seconds and Watson was talking for about, it was over four minutes long, the video.
[03:34:43.560 --> 03:34:46.422]  So that's not a copyright violation.
[03:34:46.422 --> 03:34:46.762]  Right.
[03:34:46.762 --> 03:34:47.702]  So that's pretty strange.
[03:34:47.702 --> 03:34:58.327]  And one of the things that's there is that the guy, the father, they talk about Turban Cowboy, he gets aligned in that episode with an Islamic terrorist.
[03:34:58.327 --> 03:34:58.508]  Right.
[03:34:58.508 --> 03:34:59.368]  He's a Tea Party guy.
[03:34:59.548 --> 03:35:02.650]  Okay, so that all feeds into the narrative that they've been building.
[03:35:02.650 --> 03:35:09.554]  They've been trying to get you on because they keep saying that it's going to be your right-wing extremist, even yesterday.
[03:35:09.554 --> 03:35:12.916]  And they keep saying, well, InfoWars is making all these claims without any evidence.
[03:35:12.916 --> 03:35:17.799]  I mean, how many people made claims yesterday that it's going to be some right-winger without any type of evidence?
[03:35:17.799 --> 03:35:21.041]  They say politics makes strange bedfellows.
[03:35:21.841 --> 03:35:25.483]  There aren't any stranger bedfellows on the Tea Party and Islamic terrorists.
[03:35:25.483 --> 03:35:33.127]  I mean, they can't get any more polar opposites together, and yet they keep putting them together as bosom buddies throughout all these Hollywood shows.
[03:35:33.127 --> 03:35:33.727]  Exactly.
[03:35:33.727 --> 03:35:42.132]  It's not just that it was the following the Fox TV show I even saw, you know, episode of Green Lantern, and I mean, it goes way down the rabbit hole.
[03:35:42.132 --> 03:35:44.473]  It's not any one-time deal, one-off deal.
[03:35:44.473 --> 03:35:49.516]  It's something that has happened and continues to happen, because I believe that it was a recent episode.
[03:35:50.316 --> 03:35:53.137]  So it's nothing new, and why would they play that right before?
[03:35:53.137 --> 03:35:55.957]  And some people say, well, you're just grasping at straws.
[03:35:55.957 --> 03:35:58.558]  But then you look at the Batman film.
[03:35:58.558 --> 03:36:00.098]  You know, Alex did a video on that.
[03:36:00.098 --> 03:36:02.158]  And people are like, how do you know before it happens?
[03:36:02.158 --> 03:36:03.939]  Because he sees these triggers.
[03:36:03.939 --> 03:36:11.540]  And more recently, I don't believe the film has come out yet, but World War Z. You know, it's all about the dehumanization and the U.N.
[03:36:11.540 --> 03:36:13.521]  is here to save us heroically.
[03:36:13.521 --> 03:36:14.461]  What are your thoughts on that, David?
[03:36:14.901 --> 03:36:19.504]  Well, it's just, you know, we're criticized by people like Glenn Beck and Salon.
[03:36:19.504 --> 03:36:23.106]  But we see this, as you said, we see it from a Hollywood narrative.
[03:36:23.106 --> 03:36:30.071]  We see it from papers that are being put out by West Point Military Academy, other terrorist organizations.
[03:36:30.071 --> 03:36:41.879]  We've seen a steady stream of this narrative about how the enemies of this country are people who are looking for limited government, people who think there ought to be limits on the government, people who want to adhere to the Constitution.
[03:36:42.419 --> 03:36:45.602]  People that they like to characterize, therefore, as right-wing.
[03:36:45.602 --> 03:36:48.284]  We keep seeing this over and over and over again.
[03:36:48.284 --> 03:36:52.387]  And that's why, when we saw this happen, we were suspicious of it.
[03:36:52.387 --> 03:36:59.213]  Because there's not anything about, you know, we were criticized for jumping on it saying, well, this might look like, this might be a false flag.
[03:36:59.213 --> 03:37:00.294]  Let's take a look at this.
[03:37:00.294 --> 03:37:01.315]  We said that right away.
[03:37:02.074 --> 03:37:03.434]  That we should examine this.
[03:37:03.434 --> 03:37:03.915]  Why?
[03:37:03.915 --> 03:37:09.596]  Because when you have a crime in an area, you want to look at the MO of the people that are there.
[03:37:09.596 --> 03:37:17.459]  In other words, if you've got somebody that's a known rapist and he's in the area, or a child molester, and you have a crime of that type, you're going to take a look at the person that's there.
[03:37:17.459 --> 03:37:28.582]  And we have documented over and over again, there's been declassified documents going back for decades talking about false flag attacks that the government has done, or false flag attacks that they planned, like Operation Northwoods.
[03:37:28.582 --> 03:37:30.243]  And so when we see things like that,
[03:37:31.252 --> 03:37:39.097]  And we believe that there were similar things that happened in 9-11 and in the 7-7 bombings and in the Oslo-Norway bombings.
[03:37:39.097 --> 03:37:42.660]  We see that they have a drill that's operating alongside.
[03:37:42.660 --> 03:37:48.163]  So we were already suspicious because the government had that kind of MO.
[03:37:48.163 --> 03:37:54.948]  There's nothing there that anybody would really gain from except the government because they're going to be able to ramp up the security state.
[03:37:54.948 --> 03:37:56.289]  And then when we saw the drill,
[03:37:57.109 --> 03:37:57.930]  We're good to go.
[03:38:24.867 --> 03:38:28.470]  Back combining flat bags and evidence removed.
[03:38:28.470 --> 03:38:37.018]  Police also hunting dark-skinned man with hooded dark colored sweatshirt and backpack seen trying to get into restricted area.
[03:38:38.186 --> 03:38:43.307]  So, I guess that's what the new suspect is supposed to be, the dark-skinned man, the man with the hoodie.
[03:38:43.307 --> 03:38:46.867]  I'm not exactly sure if that's the person we saw on the rooftops or not.
[03:38:46.867 --> 03:38:57.629]  Well, in terms of the Saudi, I saw one article, and I have only seen it in one place, so I don't know if this is valid or not, but I saw a report that he was apprehended because he was running after the bomb.
[03:38:57.629 --> 03:38:59.230]  Somebody pointed at him and said, get him.
[03:38:59.230 --> 03:39:07.451]  Now, I don't know if they pointed at him because he was an Arab-looking guy doing what most people would probably be doing after a bomb goes off, and that is running in some direction.
[03:39:07.911 --> 03:39:11.072]  So, uh, I think that was basically what was going on with it.
[03:39:11.072 --> 03:39:23.974]  I think he was basically just, you know, singled out because, yeah, because a bomb goes off and you can see in the videos, there are people of all races from I'm sure all number of countries and they just scatter, you know, just trying to get away from the blast.
[03:39:23.974 --> 03:39:26.335]  But it seems like this guy was singled out.
[03:39:26.335 --> 03:39:29.716]  You know, there have been a lot of bombings that have been done by Muslim people.
[03:39:29.716 --> 03:39:31.416]  But, you know, interestingly enough,
[03:39:32.116 --> 03:39:35.879]  There haven't been any bombings that have been done by Patriot people.
[03:39:35.879 --> 03:39:37.740]  Certainly, you know, not urban bombings.
[03:39:37.740 --> 03:39:38.981]  I can't think of any offhand.
[03:39:38.981 --> 03:39:44.225]  I mean, they've tried to pin it on Richard Jewell and stuff like that, but that was fake.
[03:39:44.225 --> 03:39:50.569]  I mean, when you're looking at something like this, again, going back to what we said, we've seen the government operate this way many times.
[03:39:50.569 --> 03:39:58.835]  So when something like this happens, that's the first thing we want to look at and look and see if there's any other telltale signs like a simultaneous drill.
[03:39:58.835 --> 03:39:59.335]  Exactly.
[03:39:59.335 --> 03:40:01.237]  Now, because we got a lot of criticism.
[03:40:02.057 --> 03:40:06.900]  ...saying that this is a possibility, you know, possibly a false flag.
[03:40:06.900 --> 03:40:10.502]  But so many other people were quick to say that it's not a false flag.
[03:40:10.502 --> 03:40:15.805]  And I'm like, well, how is their credibility more than ours when they're just, with no evidence, that it's not a false flag?
[03:40:15.805 --> 03:40:16.746]  No, it's not a false flag.
[03:40:16.746 --> 03:40:18.267]  And we say, well, there's a possibility.
[03:40:18.267 --> 03:40:21.349]  Nobody said it was definitely, so we didn't hear it info-wise.
[03:40:21.349 --> 03:40:22.870]  Peter Bergen, who immediately says...
[03:40:23.610 --> 03:40:25.732]  That's it's a conservative right-wing terrorist.
[03:40:25.732 --> 03:40:27.693]  What evidence do you have of that narrative?
[03:40:27.693 --> 03:40:30.515]  He'd already been building that narrative for 10 days prior to that.
[03:40:30.515 --> 03:40:39.783]  Okay an article said he put out and then he immediately does that and exactly he doesn't have any basis to say it any more than we said well we need to look at this and see if it is a false flag.
[03:40:39.783 --> 03:40:40.003]  Why?
[03:40:40.003 --> 03:40:41.484]  Because we've seen a lot of false flags.
[03:40:41.584 --> 03:40:46.047]  Exactly, and we have reason to suspect that it may be, just like you said, the drills.
[03:40:46.047 --> 03:40:47.228]  Why are they running drills?
[03:40:47.228 --> 03:40:52.192]  I mean, if they have bomb-sniffing dogs, shouldn't they sniff a bomb that's right over there?
[03:40:52.192 --> 03:40:57.596]  I mean, just basic, common-sense questions that, you know, thus far have not been really asked.
[03:40:57.596 --> 03:41:04.942]  You know, nobody at the press conferences, at least that we've seen besides Dan Bodondi, has dared go and question these people on, you know, real things that
[03:41:05.638 --> 03:41:07.079]  You know, people should be concerned about it.
[03:41:07.079 --> 03:41:08.321]  I mean, were there drills?
[03:41:08.321 --> 03:41:09.001]  Were there not?
[03:41:09.001 --> 03:41:13.686]  We have many eyewitnesses, people who were there at the event saying that they did.
[03:41:13.686 --> 03:41:14.507]  But they didn't want to.
[03:41:14.507 --> 03:41:18.871]  They shut down the press conference when they got asked a pointed question like that.
[03:41:18.871 --> 03:41:21.013]  They just want fluff questions, you know?
[03:41:21.013 --> 03:41:27.379]  And we can come across as being hard-hearted because we don't want to just focus on the victims and that sort of thing.
[03:41:27.379 --> 03:41:29.040]  But we're looking further down the road.
[03:41:30.042 --> 03:41:38.779]  We're not, it's not that we don't feel what's going on with the people who've lost their lives, many people who've been horribly mutilated from this.
[03:41:39.741 --> 03:41:43.202]  But we also understand where this is headed.
[03:41:43.202 --> 03:41:51.226]  We said it when it happened with 9-11, and we got things like the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security, and we know what they've been building up for.
[03:41:51.226 --> 03:42:02.810]  And if you're another country, if you're Russia, and you see somebody building up arms on your border, pointing missiles at you, you're going to start getting paranoid about that, and you're going to start arming.
[03:42:02.810 --> 03:42:04.151]  And that's what the American people are doing.
[03:42:04.151 --> 03:42:04.891]  They see the government.
[03:42:05.351 --> 03:42:06.612]  Building up domestic arms.
[03:42:06.612 --> 03:42:09.394]  When they buy these hollow-point bullets, that is not for the military.
[03:42:09.394 --> 03:42:11.155]  The military has their own armament.
[03:42:11.155 --> 03:42:14.377]  They're going into the public supply to get these things.
[03:42:14.377 --> 03:42:19.060]  And the military is prohibited by Geneva Convention from using hollow-point bullets.
[03:42:19.060 --> 03:42:30.567]  And so when we see them getting billions of bullets, which are just over the top of anything that they would need, and we see them getting armored personnel carriers, thousands of them, we see them getting bully automatic rifles.
[03:42:30.567 --> 03:42:30.747]  Yeah.
[03:42:31.587 --> 03:42:35.209]  Bulletproof booths to put on the roadblocks, that sort of thing.
[03:42:35.209 --> 03:42:37.410]  All of this stuff, and it's like, what are they doing?
[03:42:37.410 --> 03:42:38.991]  Because this is a domestic organization.
[03:42:38.991 --> 03:42:46.494]  But at the same time, we see these military documents where they're talking about selective internment and getting social security numbers.
[03:42:46.994 --> 03:42:47.294]  Mm-hmm.
[03:42:47.294 --> 03:42:48.135]  And getting other things.
[03:42:48.135 --> 03:42:50.137]  That is not for foreign wars.
[03:42:50.137 --> 03:42:52.299]  That is not for urban control in foreign areas.
[03:42:52.299 --> 03:42:59.005]  And when they have these military operations that they've been having increasingly frequently throughout the major U.S.
[03:42:59.005 --> 03:43:03.830]  cities, they're doing these as joint operations with police departments.
[03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:07.973]  They don't, they, are they going to do operations in Iran with the Iranian police?
[03:43:07.973 --> 03:43:08.934]  I don't think so.
[03:43:08.934 --> 03:43:09.395]  Exactly.
[03:43:09.395 --> 03:43:10.316]  These are about
[03:43:11.380 --> 03:43:12.560]  Doing something domestically.
[03:43:26.585 --> 03:43:27.706]  And it's an acclamation.
[03:43:27.706 --> 03:43:35.950]  People get used to seeing the troops at the Super Bowl, not just, you know, during the halftime game, but troops out there checking bags or, you know, running checkpoints or whatever it is.
[03:43:35.950 --> 03:43:40.472]  And people get so used to it when they go out to the streets of, you know, the city of Boston.
[03:43:40.472 --> 03:43:41.213]  Oh, there's a bomb.
[03:43:41.213 --> 03:43:42.093]  Well, the troops are already here.
[03:43:42.093 --> 03:43:46.396]  I'm not saying the troops were in on it, but the troops were all ready to go.
[03:43:46.396 --> 03:43:48.437]  And we've seen the pictures.
[03:43:48.437 --> 03:43:54.540]  I believe it was, oh, OK, we're watching something on InfoWars.com forward slash listen.
[03:43:56.491 --> 03:44:02.874]  Okay, this is something Alex was mentioning earlier today with Manacal, this is... Wow.
[03:44:02.874 --> 03:44:07.576]  Okay, so we see a bunch of bodies, or those are... Mannequins.
[03:44:07.576 --> 03:44:08.537]  Mannequins, yes.
[03:44:08.537 --> 03:44:09.697]  Those are the mannequins, okay.
[03:44:09.697 --> 03:44:15.740]  So we see a bunch of mannequins in a truck, driving around, I'm assuming that's in the city of Boston, correct guys?
[03:44:15.740 --> 03:44:17.661]  Those are mannequins that were shot.
[03:44:17.661 --> 03:44:18.041]  Wow.
[03:44:18.041 --> 03:44:18.962]  Used as target practice.
[03:44:19.762 --> 03:44:21.323]  I heard Alex talk about that on the radio.
[03:44:21.323 --> 03:44:22.963]  I did not see the clip, so I didn't know.
[03:44:22.963 --> 03:44:24.544]  Yeah, that's shocking to me.
[03:44:24.544 --> 03:44:26.144]  That's my first time seeing that clip as well.
[03:44:26.144 --> 03:44:34.268]  I heard him mention it, but yeah, we just saw a truckload full of mannequins, if you're still listening on the radio, a truckload of mannequins near the Boston event.
[03:44:34.268 --> 03:44:48.253]  When the government starts making targets, starts commissioning targets of civilians, you know, American citizens, pregnant women, elderly people, kids, and commissioning targets of that, and call it no hesitation, when we see them doing all this other stuff, it's like,
[03:44:49.039 --> 03:44:50.079]  We're not being paranoid.
[03:44:50.079 --> 03:44:52.800]  We're just looking at this and saying, you know, they're up to something.
[03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:54.781]  And we've seen them do other things.
[03:44:54.781 --> 03:45:02.524]  And I don't see how you can say that somebody's being paranoid if you're watching on Infowars.com forward slash listen or on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:45:02.524 --> 03:45:04.725]  You can see a target of a pregnant woman.
[03:45:04.725 --> 03:45:05.925]  This is a shooting target.
[03:45:05.925 --> 03:45:07.126]  Somebody is going to shoot at this.
[03:45:07.126 --> 03:45:16.589]  If we keep scrolling down, you'll see a picture of a little boy, of an old man, of an old woman, of a teenager and her daughter or sister, whoever it is.
[03:45:17.309 --> 03:45:19.210]  And this is what people are planning for.
[03:45:19.210 --> 03:45:21.370]  The government is planning to target these people.
[03:45:21.370 --> 03:45:23.031]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:45:23.031 --> 03:45:29.373]  Well, let's talk about something here that is not exactly about the bombing, but I think this is all related.
[03:45:29.373 --> 03:45:30.893]  And that is CISPA.
[03:45:30.893 --> 03:45:37.895]  You know, we look at the gun rights and various things, we see that CISPA is back and headed for a vote this week.
[03:45:37.895 --> 03:45:40.576]  That's the headline that I've got here, guys, if you want to search for that.
[03:45:41.536 --> 03:45:47.600]  Basically, this is something that is a cybersecurity measure is how it's being put out.
[03:45:47.600 --> 03:45:54.864]  And in order to do that, they're going to enact certain surveillance and controls over the internet and over free speech.
[03:45:54.864 --> 03:45:59.287]  And it's sad that we see a constituency out there that wants to defend the Second Amendment.
[03:46:00.291 --> 03:46:05.539]  Uh, but, uh, they're not necessarily interested in internet freedom or free speech.
[03:46:05.539 --> 03:46:11.868]  And then we also see the people who might be interested in free speech and keeping the internet free that are absolutely opposed.
[03:46:11.868 --> 03:46:13.410]  Yeah, you have to have all your freedoms.
[03:46:13.410 --> 03:46:14.131]  That's right.
[03:46:14.131 --> 03:46:16.194]  We need the second and the fourth amendment.
[03:46:16.594 --> 03:46:19.316]  And the rest of the 10 in the Constitution.
[03:46:19.316 --> 03:46:21.057]  Those are put in there for a reason.
[03:46:21.057 --> 03:46:28.743]  And you see, and this is why we need to get rid of this left-right paradigm, and we need people to come together and understand the underlying issue here is liberty.
[03:46:28.743 --> 03:46:40.191]  Because they're coming after them and using the same justifications, the same reason they're saying that we need to lose internet freedom, and we need to have no security in our person, places, and, you know, things.
[03:46:40.191 --> 03:46:43.973]  We need to be able to be searched at any time, constantly archived.
[03:46:43.973 --> 03:46:45.455]  I mean, this is the exact
[03:46:46.448 --> 03:46:47.009]  We're good to go.
[03:47:03.231 --> 03:47:04.492]  Well, I don't know how it is.
[03:47:04.492 --> 03:47:07.654]  I mean, they can check your phone and your whatever else.
[03:47:07.654 --> 03:47:09.075]  I mean, what is that argument?
[03:47:09.075 --> 03:47:16.301]  To me, I look at this and because of technology, it is even more important that we have
[03:47:17.662 --> 03:47:18.722]  Okay, that's something going on.
[03:47:18.722 --> 03:47:19.603]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[03:47:19.603 --> 03:47:20.843]  That's not ours.
[03:47:20.843 --> 03:47:28.325]  But because of this, I think it is even more important that we have Fourth Amendment protections, not less.
[03:47:28.325 --> 03:47:42.789]  And so, you know, when the government can set up the Utah Data Center, when the government can record and listen to every phone conversation and archive it and save it to the point where they can data mine it for everything and make a suspect out of everybody.
[03:47:42.789 --> 03:47:46.210]  I mean, you have taken the Fourth Amendment, what the founders saw,
[03:47:47.011 --> 03:47:47.331]  I think?
[03:48:07.194 --> 03:48:07.654]  Exactly.
[03:48:23.684 --> 03:48:37.531]  On liberty and on the Constitution and on the Bill of Rights and insist that technology only makes the government more dangerous and we need to more even more rigidly enforce the protections of the Constitution rather than give them up.
[03:48:37.531 --> 03:48:38.492]  Exactly.
[03:48:38.492 --> 03:48:44.075]  And this is the Alex Jones Radio Show and I'm Takari Jackson here with David Knight if you're just tuning in.
[03:48:44.075 --> 03:48:50.358]  Now we're talking about some of the things that are slipping under the radar as this situation in Boston continues to develop.
[03:48:50.678 --> 03:48:54.479]  The FBI is up there running their checks trying to see, you know, what new information they can find.
[03:48:54.479 --> 03:49:02.361]  But in the meantime, we want to talk about some things that aren't so much hitting the mainstream just because, you know, of all the things going on in Boston, you know, that's understandable.
[03:49:02.361 --> 03:49:03.781]  But we can't forget about CISPA.
[03:49:03.781 --> 03:49:07.722]  We can't forget about gun rights, not just domestic issues, international issues.
[03:49:07.722 --> 03:49:09.763]  But David Knight, you were continuing with your CISPA.
[03:49:09.983 --> 03:49:18.545]  Yeah, we're going to say, you need to call your representatives and say, you know, I want you to vote against gun bans and I want you to vote against CISPA.
[03:49:18.545 --> 03:49:24.446]  Come across as a unified front and call your representatives, whether they're Democrat or Republican.
[03:49:24.446 --> 03:49:29.888]  Democrats are probably going to be sensitive and supportive of one issue more than Republicans and vice versa.
[03:49:29.888 --> 03:49:35.469]  But you as a voter need to call them up and say, I want you to vote against both of these bills.
[03:49:35.609 --> 03:49:43.935]  And people don't understand how important it is to actually call, because we get a lot of people, you know, they'll blog, they'll talk to their friends, they'll preach to the choir.
[03:49:43.935 --> 03:49:49.079]  But you need to go and talk to your elected officials, you know, and I'm not just blowing smoke.
[03:49:49.079 --> 03:49:54.863]  When Chuckie Schumer compared private gun sellers to child pornographers, I called his office.
[03:49:54.863 --> 03:49:55.644]  I didn't get to talk to him.
[03:49:55.644 --> 03:50:00.588]  I talked to one of his interns, but I called to make my voice known.
[03:50:00.588 --> 03:50:01.649]  And this is what it has to take.
[03:50:01.649 --> 03:50:03.570]  You know, you have to call your representative.
[03:50:03.570 --> 03:50:04.631]  Lo and behold, show up.
[03:50:05.391 --> 03:50:08.974]  You know, show up at your city council meeting, you know, do what you have to do.
[03:50:08.974 --> 03:50:10.415]  Yell at them like Dan Bodondi.
[03:50:10.415 --> 03:50:12.497]  Jump on the couch like Tom Cruise.
[03:50:12.497 --> 03:50:14.198]  Get these people to pay attention to you.
[03:50:14.198 --> 03:50:15.479]  It does make a difference.
[03:50:15.479 --> 03:50:22.004]  I know that early days of homeschooling, they were going to pass some measures that were going to severely terminate it.
[03:50:22.004 --> 03:50:26.928]  And boy, I tell you, the homeschoolers got that network out there and they gave them an earful and they backed off.
[03:50:27.481 --> 03:50:28.262]  They really backed off.
[03:50:28.262 --> 03:50:30.044]  So that was an important lesson.
[03:50:30.044 --> 03:50:33.048]  But you know, Congress can agree on some things.
[03:50:33.048 --> 03:50:36.151]  And they passed this one law about a year ago.
[03:50:36.151 --> 03:50:38.214]  They passed the Stock Act.
[03:50:38.214 --> 03:50:38.694]  Right.
[03:50:38.694 --> 03:50:40.457]  And I think we're about to wrap up.
[03:50:40.457 --> 03:50:43.941]  So just hang on to that thought and we'll be right back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:03.901]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:51:03.901 --> 03:51:07.563]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.

[03:51:50.851 --> 03:51:53.552]  Since disaster can strike at any time, you always need to be prepared.
[03:51:53.552 --> 03:51:55.173]  And not just with an insurance policy.
[03:51:55.173 --> 03:51:57.915]  Superstorm Sandy left thousands of people starving and stranded for weeks.
[03:51:57.915 --> 03:52:00.616]  You need to be prepared with an emergency supply of food.

[03:53:01.758 --> 03:53:10.324]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[03:53:10.324 --> 03:53:14.007]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[03:53:14.007 --> 03:53:18.450]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[03:54:21.434 --> 03:54:23.716]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[03:54:23.716 --> 03:54:26.898]  I'm Jakari Jackson filling in along with David Knight.
[03:54:26.898 --> 03:54:34.763]  And we're going to be going for a little bit longer, I believe an extra hour of overdrive, but be sure to check out the InfoWars Nightly News tonight at 7 p.m.
[03:54:34.763 --> 03:54:35.463]  Central.
[03:54:35.463 --> 03:54:40.646]  Now David Knight, we were talking about some of the things that are slipping through while the Boston investigation is ongoing.
[03:54:40.646 --> 03:54:41.207]  What else do you have?
[03:54:41.687 --> 03:54:46.270]  Well, you know, we can get the two different parties to agree on some things.
[03:54:46.270 --> 03:54:51.273]  And one of the things that they agreed on very quickly was to gut the STOCK Act.
[03:54:51.273 --> 03:54:57.357]  Now that was the, an acronym, STOCK was Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act.
[03:54:57.357 --> 03:55:05.162]  And that came up, if you remember, there was a report about a year ago that there was a lot of insider trading going on in Congress on stocks and that sort of thing.
[03:55:05.982 --> 03:55:08.825]  And they said, oh, there's no law against that.
[03:55:08.825 --> 03:55:12.487]  And people got pretty upset about that, so they passed that law.
[03:55:12.487 --> 03:55:21.275]  And that required that congressmen and about 28,000 aides that were associated with them had to publish anything that was a conflict of interest.
[03:55:21.955 --> 03:55:33.623]  And so what happened is, as we were looking the other way, at the end of the week last week in the Senate on the 11th, it was introduced and passed in the Senate, unanimous consent is the way they put it.
[03:55:33.623 --> 03:55:35.704]  So they don't keep a roll call vote.
[03:55:35.704 --> 03:55:37.145]  And so they just passed it very quickly.
[03:55:37.145 --> 03:55:40.647]  And in the House, they passed it in 30 seconds.
[03:55:40.647 --> 03:55:41.187]  30 seconds.
[03:55:41.187 --> 03:55:42.068]  30 seconds.
[03:55:42.068 --> 03:55:44.810]  And so they did it there essentially unanimously.
[03:55:45.550 --> 03:55:51.416]  Basically, what they've done is gutted it because they no longer have to post that publicly.
[03:55:51.416 --> 03:55:58.503]  So whatever remains there, it really isn't useful for people to be able to investigate that, hold them accountable.
[03:55:58.503 --> 03:56:01.987]  So basically, they've essentially gutted that while we were looking the other way.
[03:56:02.955 --> 03:56:04.276]  And it's just more of what we've seen.
[03:56:04.276 --> 03:56:05.737]  We've seen, what was it last week?
[03:56:05.737 --> 03:56:08.499]  Bitcoin dropped, you know, significantly.
[03:56:08.499 --> 03:56:12.102]  We've seen gold and silver stocks drop as well.
[03:56:12.102 --> 03:56:18.948]  I mean, it's a lot of things going on behind the scenes while this massacre is going on, or while the massacre is being investigated.
[03:56:18.948 --> 03:56:20.389]  And it's not just these things.
[03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:26.173]  We had a chance to talk to many of our listeners yesterday, and I would like to take some calls after we have Stuart Rhodes on.
[03:56:26.173 --> 03:56:27.795]  He's going to be joining us.
[03:56:27.795 --> 03:56:29.316]  He's going to be joining us in a few minutes.
[03:56:30.933 --> 03:56:38.797]  People need to keep in mind that there are always things going on behind the scenes when these big events happen, and you need to keep in touch with your local legislators.
[03:56:38.797 --> 03:56:48.441]  You need to talk to people and find out what's going on in your area, because there may be something in your local area that you can go film, something that's going on that needs to have its story told, but people just don't know about it.
[03:56:48.621 --> 03:56:51.463]  And they're very well aware of the news cycle.
[03:56:51.463 --> 03:56:58.809]  Okay, this stuff was done on Friday, and they know that they can pull all kinds of stuff on Friday and the weekends and it's not going to get covered very much.
[03:56:58.809 --> 03:57:11.178]  And when they pull this in and do it in 30 seconds, you know, and so, and they also know, just as they know that they can do this stuff on Fridays and the weekends, when you've got a big event like this, they can put all kinds of stuff under
[03:57:11.758 --> 03:57:11.978]  I think?
[03:57:42.298 --> 03:57:47.862]  News special report currently regarding two bombs that have gone off in Boston.
[03:57:47.862 --> 03:57:50.023]  Something that's a little interesting.
[03:57:50.023 --> 03:57:56.207]  I will close up here what looks to be some type of blood and gore, perhaps a body part or something like that.
[03:57:56.207 --> 03:58:03.852]  Now I want you to take a look at what happens here when this individual walks past this gore.
[03:58:03.852 --> 03:58:10.076]  And suddenly the blood is gone and the gore is gone and some type of a bizarre object has been left in its place.
[03:58:11.454 --> 03:58:12.695]  Um, draw your own conclusion.
[03:58:42.506 --> 03:58:45.774]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
