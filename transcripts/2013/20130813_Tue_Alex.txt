[00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:06.247]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.247 --> 00:00:08.008]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.769]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.370]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.911]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:17.113]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:30.361]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:31.482]  I have never seen
[00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:40.972]  Such a concerted rollout of basically military martial law acclimation conditioning drills going on.
[00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:44.055]  Atterbury, Indiana.
[00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:52.445]  They're all over the news showing burning vehicles and terrorists attacking, but it's all simulated to create the perception of fear in the general public.
[00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:53.958]  U.S.
[00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.761]  Army conducts military occupation drill in small-town Wisconsin.
[00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.462]  Kit Daniels has an article on that.
[00:00:59.462 --> 00:01:04.206]  Operation Trigger emulates military control of local elected officials.
[00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:05.066]  That's on record.
[00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.829]  The Army PSYOPS is running that operation.
[00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:15.354]  And then you've got, of course, the fake terror drills, which they told police were real, this week in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:16.855]  It just goes on and on.
[00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:21.499]  That is just some of what we're going to be breaking down and covering today.
[00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.364]  And again, when you go and read what the PSYOP groups are admitting, this is for America.
[00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:31.128]  This is Brigade Homeland that the Pentagon's been talking about for five years.
[00:01:31.128 --> 00:01:34.631]  And they're taught their enemy is not Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:38.015]  This is even in the Washington Times Associated Press.
[00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:45.883]  Their enemy will be the Tea Party they believe that will attack their loving leaders, their loving foreign bankers that have taken over.
[00:01:46.786 --> 00:02:04.170]  Their only problem is most of the military is waking up to the fact that the command structure is under a corporate foreign coup d'etat, which is French for coup d'etat, to quote the great philosopher Carlos from the movie Hop.
[00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:13.613]  But ladies and gentlemen, to get serious here, we haven't had an article on this yet, but kiosks and libraries everywhere were being sent the videos
[00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:16.740]  are saying you can't get to InfoWars.com.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:35.906]  People are shooting video of this because it's quote racist and also British Library Network blocks Hamlet for violent content so this is the new they can teach five-year-olds in the UK and the US how to do things that I didn't know about till I was 20.
[00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:38.367]  Things I can't even say on adult radio.
[00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.307]  You know what they teach them.
[00:02:40.307 --> 00:02:41.688]  But you can't have Hamlet
[00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:45.098]  Because it's got some sword fights in it, and that's violent.
[00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.980]  You've got to learn how to be a minion.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.063]  Plus it makes government, you know, out as corrupt and very thought-provoking.
[00:02:51.063 --> 00:02:54.545]  To be or not to be, that is the question.
[00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:56.306]  Is it nobler?
[00:02:56.306 --> 00:03:00.469]  The point is, is that that's being banned, don't worry, and InfoWars.com.
[00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.170]  Thank goodness.
[00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.934]  And I mentioned this briefly yesterday, but after the show I noticed he'd been banned from the radio circuit.
[00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:10.477]  Blacklisted.
[00:03:10.477 --> 00:03:11.637]  From the rodeo.
[00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:15.452]  Circuit.
[00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:20.474]  And they've got representatives saying it's the ugly face of intolerance and racism.
[00:03:20.474 --> 00:03:23.956]  A rodeo clown dressed up like Obama as part of a skit.
[00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:26.537]  And don't worry, he'll never work again.
[00:03:26.537 --> 00:03:29.898]  You don't make fun of Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il.
[00:03:29.898 --> 00:03:33.079]  In Nazi Germany, you don't make fun of Adolf Hitler.
[00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.060]  In Communist China, you don't make fun of Mao Zedong.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.461]  And you don't make fun of Obama.
[00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:39.062]  Well, guess what?
[00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:39.982]  I'm gonna do it today.
[00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.520]  I'm so... Atlanta, the free home of the brave.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.921]  And the worst part was that they made a joke about the clown being chased by the bull.
[00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:51.922]  That's what the rodeo clowns do for folks that have never been to a rodeo.
[00:03:51.922 --> 00:03:56.083]  They're saying that's the threat on the president now.
[00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:57.803]  That the bull chased him around.
[00:03:57.803 --> 00:03:59.024]  That's what the clowns do.
[00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:06.594]  And by the way, I've read about rodeos where they did jokes of Nixon, Reagan, and others.
[00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:07.615]  That's part of the deal.
[00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:11.097]  And I'm sure it was playing to an anti-Obama sentiment.
[00:04:11.097 --> 00:04:15.939]  But I can tell you this is the type of stuff that goes on at rodeos.
[00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.800]  So I'm going to commit a thought crime.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.761]  I'm going to destroy the image of our leader today on air.
[00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:24.003]  I don't wish our dear leader, puppet leader, any harm.
[00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:26.544]  The last thing I want is that he turn into a martyr.
[00:04:26.544 --> 00:04:28.025]  But I will commit the thought crime.
[00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:29.386]  I mean, will the Secret Service come?
[00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:35.073]  I'm going to smash this mask on air of our Fuhrer, our leader, our commander.
[00:04:35.073 --> 00:04:39.255]  I'm going to play Obama, a child praying to Obama while I do it.
[00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:48.498]  We've got a big broadcast lined up, Staff Sergeant Joe Briggs in studio, Dan Dixon in studio, and Dr. Seth Farber as well.
[00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:52.720]  All this and more, Super Friends, as Aquaman saves the day.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.720]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.781]  Seriously, we'll be right back.
[00:05:00.658 --> 00:05:14.406]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, PureSilver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens, and parasites.

[00:05:46.877 --> 00:05:49.978]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:05:49.978 --> 00:05:58.000]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.841]  We're good to go!
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.661]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[00:07:00.365 --> 00:07:08.112]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:07:08.112 --> 00:07:12.355]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[00:08:01.055 --> 00:08:06.398]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:15.583]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:25.569]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scoring particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes.
[00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:28.991]  To recap those revisions, women
[00:08:30.294 --> 00:08:34.595]  ...are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets.
[00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:43.357]  But teenagers now rack up 40 points, and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:53.299]  The big score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old, has been upped to 100 points.
[00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:58.940]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[00:09:03.416 --> 00:09:07.499]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:09:07.499 --> 00:09:10.460]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.082]  Turn me loose!
[00:09:12.082 --> 00:09:18.285]  I'm a live wire transmitting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:18.285 --> 00:09:21.728]  We're being brought in by a motley group of fellas.
[00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:25.910]  And when it comes to liberty, I am motley, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.231]  I am not bowing down.
[00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:28.332]  I am not a slave.
[00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:37.691]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the 13th day of August 2013.
[00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:39.533]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:41.514]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:44.956]  Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs, very interesting fellow.
[00:09:44.956 --> 00:09:46.437]  Really an interesting war story.
[00:09:46.437 --> 00:09:50.640]  He's seen a massive amount of combat, if you can dig it out of him.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.541]  He's going to be in studio with us.
[00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:57.845]  Friends, of course, with the award-winning reporter Michael Hastings, whose car blew up
[00:09:58.445 --> 00:10:13.635]  New mainstream news developments on that, on his car was not going as fast as they said, it did blow up according to witnesses and video, and he was investigating the CIA director, that was what he was looking into, and that's what he told friends as well, when the car went boom.
[00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:16.937]  So he'll be popping in with us in the next hour.
[00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:26.102]  Dan Dix, Press for Truth from Canada is down here visiting with us, working on Obama Deception 2 with us, around the country shooting amazing B-roll for us.
[00:10:26.102 --> 00:10:28.003]  He's down here working on the film with us.
[00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:28.964]  He'll be popping in.
[00:10:28.964 --> 00:10:41.332]  And then Dr. Seth Farber, who's a psychiatrist, will be getting into how the psychological definitions they're coming out with just say, saying that if anybody basically wants any liberty,
[00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:48.761]  Or any type of freedom that they are mentally ill.
[00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:54.428]  So that is coming up today in the third hour.
[00:10:54.428 --> 00:10:58.955]  This first hour, of course, will be jam-packed with news and information here.
[00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.433]  I want to get into Obamacare now that it's being implemented.
[00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:13.578]  Everything that was in the bill that they wouldn't let us see until days before they passed it two plus years ago is now coming out.
[00:11:14.468 --> 00:11:26.612]  And if you go up to DrudgeReport.com, it has probably the largest group of stories breaking down exactly what's going on.
[00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:35.242]  Expenses, it's now being announced.
[00:11:35.242 --> 00:11:42.130]  Sebelius is coming out and saying this is not a bait-and-switch, which is exactly what it is.
[00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:50.619]  Continuing, McConnell is saying don't open Obamacare exchanges if privacy isn't protected.
[00:11:50.619 --> 00:11:51.920]  I mean, it's designed
[00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:57.804]  Under Obamacare to give all your data to every federal, state, agency, and thousands of corporations.
[00:11:57.804 --> 00:11:59.265]  That's all on record.
[00:11:59.265 --> 00:12:02.926]  Low premium, high-debuctible health plans endangered.
[00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:13.012]  It was always meant to get rid of health care insurance competition to the big ten or so insurance companies that wrote the bill with Mitt Romney.
[00:12:13.712 --> 00:12:15.733]  And then got Obama to ram it through.
[00:12:15.733 --> 00:12:22.916]  Because idiot Democrats will support any fascist gang rape by corporations if it's got a Democrat over it.
[00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:28.018]  Also, employer fine will swell despite delay.
[00:12:28.018 --> 00:12:30.099]  That's right.
[00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:33.800]  No one gets any free health care unless you're illegal aliens, basically.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.243]  And then it cuts the quality of the care, lets government tell doctors what care they're going to give with the death panels.
[00:12:40.146 --> 00:12:46.709]  And is designed to, in the next five years, rape everyone financially and then implode the healthcare system.
[00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:50.011]  61% of doctors announced they're going to take early retirement.
[00:12:50.011 --> 00:12:52.092]  That's in big Gallup polls.
[00:12:52.092 --> 00:12:55.373]  It's designed to absolutely federalize everything else.
[00:12:55.373 --> 00:13:06.679]  The feds are coming to medical doctors of all types and saying, you get with the program, join our combines, and we'll give you protection from all these new rules that are written to where all of you can be put in jail for anything.
[00:13:07.952 --> 00:13:12.074]  Not dotting an I. Not crossing a T. You name it.
[00:13:12.074 --> 00:13:13.715]  You're gone.
[00:13:13.715 --> 00:13:15.316]  You name it.
[00:13:15.316 --> 00:13:17.377]  It's over.
[00:13:17.377 --> 00:13:17.957]  You name it.
[00:13:19.102 --> 00:13:22.823]  It's the end for you, unless you sign documents and join us.
[00:13:22.823 --> 00:13:29.184]  So, it is the nationalization, the socialization of healthcare happening right now.
[00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:39.066]  The destruction of one of the best healthcare systems in the world, now taken over by the eugenicists and the social engineers, to fully run our lives.
[00:13:39.066 --> 00:13:41.687]  And if you play ball with the new world order, you'll get your healthcare.
[00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.727]  If you don't, you won't.
[00:13:43.727 --> 00:13:46.268]  Just like if you're not a democratic donor, you can't keep your General Motors.
[00:13:48.564 --> 00:13:51.607]  Dealership, even if you've had it 85 years.
[00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:55.570]  And then Democratic Party donors, they get your dealership.
[00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.171]  And that's all on record.
[00:13:57.171 --> 00:14:08.581]  I mean, it is just the wholesale shutting down of the entire society across the board.
[00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.443]  And this has always been the program.
[00:14:11.443 --> 00:14:13.905]  This has always been the plan.
[00:14:13.905 --> 00:14:16.928]  This has always been the operation.
[00:14:19.414 --> 00:14:23.077]  This has always been the program.
[00:14:23.077 --> 00:14:31.345]  Shut down America, pass regulations and taxes that no one can pay except the insiders who are exempt and write the loopholes for themselves.
[00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:40.033]  This is command and control economy by offshore megabanks that make the mafia look like sweethearts, completely shutting everything down right now.
[00:14:42.754 --> 00:14:56.762]  Meanwhile, to divert us, they make everything about race as a distraction and a diversion when black mobs, who have been encouraged to do this by the media, attack white people every day, beating their brains out and shooting them and killing them.
[00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:59.083]  It never makes it out of the local news.
[00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:04.466]  I've got cases of that in the local news from different parts of the country.
[00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:06.187]  In Minnesota and other areas yesterday.
[00:15:07.624 --> 00:15:10.146]  One white guy was beat up by a group of 40 black people.
[00:15:10.146 --> 00:15:11.646]  His head beat in.
[00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:12.867]  That's in all the police reports.
[00:15:12.867 --> 00:15:15.208]  He's in a coma.
[00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:17.289]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:15:17.289 --> 00:15:21.011]  One more dead cracker if they take him off the life support.
[00:15:21.011 --> 00:15:23.673]  MSNBC jokes and says it's time to get the crackers.
[00:15:24.998 --> 00:15:28.179]  Al Sharpton says it's the cracker asses that have the guns.
[00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:29.300]  We're going to get them.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.961]  Fox Sports says it's racist whites that have the guns.
[00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:39.944]  This is meant to invoke whites to become racist, to then have a clash of civilizations.
[00:15:39.944 --> 00:15:42.805]  There it is, man in coma after black mob of 50 pummels him.
[00:15:42.805 --> 00:15:45.646]  World Net Daily reporting on that.
[00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:50.228]  But this is the type of issue to again invoke racial division.
[00:15:51.152 --> 00:15:59.037]  So that then it can selectively be focused on by the media to accelerate the clash while the military trains to take over every major U.S.
[00:15:59.037 --> 00:15:59.598]  city.
[00:15:59.598 --> 00:16:04.561]  And that's coming up at the bottom of the hour from Atterbury, Indiana.
[00:16:06.594 --> 00:16:10.695]  uh... to areas in wisconsin the u.s.
[00:16:10.695 --> 00:16:13.336]  army psychological warfare practices taking over u.s.
[00:16:13.336 --> 00:16:21.318]  towns and taking over the functions of elected officials in the c a and sci-op operation command battalion
[00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:27.136]  The globalists are getting ready, folks.
[00:16:27.136 --> 00:16:27.777]  It's in the cards.
[00:16:27.777 --> 00:16:37.881]  That means they're going to play the card to invoke race war in this country as a pretext to send in military stabilization forces, which we will never basically get out of.
[00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:41.443]  We're going under globalist receivership, globalist reconstruction.
[00:16:41.443 --> 00:16:42.063]  Meanwhile,
[00:16:43.757 --> 00:16:54.162]  Libraries across the world are banning things like 1984 because it, quote, has sex in it for the children while they teach the children how to have sex at age five.
[00:16:54.162 --> 00:17:00.526]  And they're banning Hamlet for violent content and Infowars.com for racist content.
[00:17:00.526 --> 00:17:02.407]  I'm not kidding because we're racist, folks.
[00:17:02.407 --> 00:17:04.288]  You've heard MSNBC.
[00:17:04.288 --> 00:17:05.528]  They say Ron Paul is racist.
[00:17:05.528 --> 00:17:06.169]  They have no evidence.
[00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:07.950]  They just say it over and over again.
[00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.992]  But even if we were racist, we shouldn't have our free speech blocked by Skynet.
[00:17:13.322 --> 00:17:20.621]  Politico, AP, Reuters, they all report Representative William Lacey, clay on clown, ugly face of intolerance.
[00:17:20.621 --> 00:17:21.283]  Obama!
[00:17:23.146 --> 00:17:29.648]  Obama is supposedly above the law and above criticism.
[00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:30.848]  He can illegally spy.
[00:17:30.848 --> 00:17:33.149]  He can illegally detain.
[00:17:33.149 --> 00:17:34.490]  They can disappear people.
[00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.290]  They can give $85 billion a month.
[00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.271]  And again, he's just the front man of all this.
[00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:40.671]  So everybody goes after Obama politically.
[00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:44.433]  He's just the mask of the bankers, the mask of the establishment.
[00:17:44.433 --> 00:17:52.015]  And when they're done doing that, ladies and gentlemen, they can just bring in a new puppet that we all start attacking.
[00:17:52.796 --> 00:18:00.724]  And when a Republican does everything Obama's been doing, why the Conservatives will defend it, and the Democrats will decry it.
[00:18:00.724 --> 00:18:05.288]  It's time for us to unify against anybody that violates the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:18:05.288 --> 00:18:08.451]  And let me tell you, Obama's a lot worse than I thought he'd be.
[00:18:08.451 --> 00:18:11.914]  He's about double what any President's ever done.
[00:18:11.914 --> 00:18:16.338]  As bad as Bush was, as bad as Clinton was, to the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:26.363]  Many top liberals have agreed with that analysis and pointed out that Obama is the more effective of evils.
[00:18:26.363 --> 00:18:33.526]  So I'm going to take you out to break here with a video that's up on DrudgeReport.com on the left-hand side.
[00:18:33.526 --> 00:18:36.267]  Video, Boy Prays to Obama.
[00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:42.070]  This is an InfoWars.com story and you can go watch the video.
[00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.651]  Let's go out to break with a little boy praying to Obama.
[00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:46.292]  Here's that video.
[00:18:47.088 --> 00:18:52.332]  And for President Barack Obama!
[00:18:52.332 --> 00:19:00.358]  Barack Obama, thank you for doing everything and all the kind stuff.
[00:19:00.358 --> 00:19:04.801]  Thank you for all the stuff that you helped us with.
[00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:12.147]  Thank you for taking the courage and responsibility for everything you have done for us.
[00:19:12.147 --> 00:19:16.110]  And God has gave you a special power.
[00:19:20.047 --> 00:19:26.571]  And you are going to handle it just fine.
[00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:31.113]  You are good, Barack Obama.
[00:19:31.113 --> 00:19:34.035]  You are great.
[00:19:34.035 --> 00:19:39.038]  And when you get older, you will be able to do great things.
[00:19:39.038 --> 00:19:40.339]  Love, Steven.
[00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:41.440]  Barack Obama!
[00:19:43.442 --> 00:19:47.507]  That is the face of authoritarian worship.
[00:19:47.507 --> 00:19:50.611]  And it's only the children under great tyrannies that love it.
[00:19:50.611 --> 00:19:58.201]  Because they create an imaginary relationship like they have with Superman with whoever the leader is, whether it's Obama or Adolf Hitler.
[00:19:58.201 --> 00:19:58.882]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:01.662]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:01.662 --> 00:20:06.124]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:06.124 --> 00:20:11.868]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:11.868 --> 00:20:15.450]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:04.215 --> 00:23:08.100]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

[00:23:48.504 --> 00:23:49.625]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[00:24:10.003 --> 00:24:16.909]  Imagine in Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, in a rodeo in Missouri, they have a clown with the president on it.
[00:24:36.869 --> 00:24:39.610]  And the national media is calling for the guy to be fired.
[00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.411]  He has been fired.
[00:24:40.411 --> 00:24:48.155]  He has been blacklisted by the Rodeo Association that has put out a letter saying that he has been blacklisted.
[00:24:48.155 --> 00:24:49.795]  They're very, very proud of themselves.
[00:24:49.795 --> 00:24:54.918]  And clearly the announcer and everybody else were involved in it and it was part of a skit.
[00:24:54.918 --> 00:24:56.839]  Why don't we fire the janitor of the rodeo?
[00:24:58.254 --> 00:25:16.164]  You know, let's let the government fund Al-Qaeda, murder people en masse, spy on us illegally, persecute the press, arrest members of the media for just reporting news, you know, federalize police, the government openly training to confiscate our guns, saying the number one enemy is Tea Party.
[00:25:16.164 --> 00:25:26.450]  They have the military all over the country trying to take on local governments if they stand up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution, just like the county government said they knew the government was planning to do.
[00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:27.731]  What was it, Lubbock last year, guys?
[00:25:28.646 --> 00:25:30.127]  It was Lubbock, wasn't it?
[00:25:30.127 --> 00:25:30.848]  Yes.
[00:25:30.848 --> 00:25:36.253]  So, so, so, so, we've got all of that going on.
[00:25:36.253 --> 00:25:40.957]  And meanwhile, the socialists and people don't like their dear leader.
[00:25:40.957 --> 00:25:42.098]  People making fun of him.
[00:25:43.211 --> 00:25:45.353]  And so now, don't worry, he's been blacklisted.
[00:25:45.353 --> 00:25:46.515]  Don't worry.
[00:25:46.515 --> 00:25:48.857]  And they're saying it's racist now.
[00:25:48.857 --> 00:25:49.658]  And all the rest of it.
[00:25:49.658 --> 00:25:50.739]  And this may even be staged.
[00:25:50.739 --> 00:25:54.923]  For all we know, we've caught him doing racist stuff to go after Rand Paul.
[00:25:54.923 --> 00:26:02.532]  We've caught him just a few weeks ago, the Democrats down there, at the Trayvon Martin deal, saying we're all racist and saying racist stuff in front of the news cameras.
[00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:03.673]  So this could be staged.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.921]  Quite frankly, I've watched some of the video of it and seen the photos.
[00:26:07.921 --> 00:26:09.382]  It looks like it was something real.
[00:26:09.382 --> 00:26:10.863]  Sounds like something they did do.
[00:26:10.863 --> 00:26:16.405]  And by the way, there probably are people out in the middle of nowhere that, you know, make jokes about black people.
[00:26:16.405 --> 00:26:21.028]  I guarantee you, you go to some, you know, other ethnic event, you're going to see people making fun of other groups.
[00:26:21.028 --> 00:26:22.548]  That's what humans do.
[00:26:22.548 --> 00:26:26.030]  But the whole point is, is it big national news?
[00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:26.550]  No.
[00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.912]  It's national news because they want to divert us and distract us.
[00:26:29.912 --> 00:26:31.393]  I mean, I've got the quotes here.
[00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:35.090]  We've got a musician saying...
[00:26:36.343 --> 00:26:38.684]  Uh, it was scary!
[00:26:38.684 --> 00:26:44.068]  Everybody screamed and just went wild as the announcer talked about having the bull run down the clown with the Obama mask.
[00:26:44.068 --> 00:26:46.529]  It was at that point I began to feel a sense of fear.
[00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:54.714]  It was the level of enthusiasm, being a 48-year-old musician from Higgsville said Sunday, referring to the reaction from the crowd that filled the fair's grandstand.
[00:26:54.714 --> 00:27:02.058]  Now that's where CNN and the rest of them, because I've seen it on TV, are really playing on the ignorance of most people that hadn't been to a rodeo.
[00:27:02.498 --> 00:27:07.182]  You may have seen bull riding on TV or something professionally, but not what goes on during the breaks.
[00:27:07.182 --> 00:27:10.044]  The clowns always run from the bulls.
[00:27:10.044 --> 00:27:12.466]  The announcer always says, that bull gonna get him!
[00:27:12.466 --> 00:27:14.567]  That bull gonna run him down!
[00:27:14.567 --> 00:27:17.370]  That is standard, and that is not racist, okay?
[00:27:18.493 --> 00:27:24.400]  They're trying to say they want to run down our God, Obama, who's the puppet front man for the globalists.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.443]  They're saying they want to run him down.
[00:27:26.443 --> 00:27:28.024]  Oh my goodness.
[00:27:28.024 --> 00:27:29.706]  It's so evil.
[00:27:29.706 --> 00:27:33.271]  It's so bad, ladies and gentlemen, to make fun of our leader.
[00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:37.255]  No one should be able to even wear a mask of him on Halloween because that's racist too!
[00:27:38.922 --> 00:27:39.983]  You make fun of Obama.
[00:27:39.983 --> 00:27:42.964]  You've seen all these stories about how it's racist to make fun of Obama.
[00:27:42.964 --> 00:27:44.345]  Everybody made fun of Bush.
[00:27:44.345 --> 00:27:46.086]  Everybody made fun of Ronald Reagan.
[00:27:46.086 --> 00:27:50.569]  I've made fun of Bush myself and gone out with Joe Rogan, dressed like Bush Sr.
[00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:51.829]  He was Bush Jr.
[00:27:51.829 --> 00:27:53.550]  And he throws me out of a wheelchair.
[00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.831]  Oh my gosh!
[00:27:54.831 --> 00:27:58.573]  Joe Rogan and Alex Jones, they're against white people!
[00:27:58.573 --> 00:27:59.474]  No we're not!
[00:27:59.474 --> 00:28:03.656]  We were doing a skit about them being devil worshippers at Bohemian Grove.
[00:28:03.656 --> 00:28:04.777]  We were joking around.
[00:28:05.503 --> 00:28:08.064]  It's Belly the Beast intro, you guys can probably find it.
[00:28:08.064 --> 00:28:09.504]  So I say this.
[00:28:09.504 --> 00:28:17.046]  They say you can't say that a bull was going to run over a clown, and they play on the ignorance of the people, going, they wanted a bull to run over Obama?
[00:28:17.046 --> 00:28:18.026]  That's a death threat!
[00:28:18.026 --> 00:28:19.747]  That's a... No, it's not!
[00:28:19.747 --> 00:28:20.647]  But here's the deal.
[00:28:20.647 --> 00:28:22.468]  This is not a sacred image.
[00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:30.810]  Obama is just a puppet frontman who symbolizes tyranny in this nation, and collectivism, and don't worry about tyranny, and you didn't build your business.
[00:28:31.761 --> 00:28:36.585]  So now they're saying the Secret Service might investigate, because the bull might, but you know, is that a threat to Obama?
[00:28:36.585 --> 00:28:37.525]  What a load of bull.
[00:28:37.525 --> 00:28:39.247]  You know what, I'm not intimidated by all this.
[00:28:39.247 --> 00:28:43.350]  I want nothing to happen to Obama, because he's nothing but a front man of the globalists.
[00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.432]  I want him to be discredited and politically destroyed.
[00:28:46.432 --> 00:28:49.094]  And American ideas brought forward again, but I'll tell you one thing.
[00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:55.579]  I've got every right to destroy the image of the so-called emperor, and I'll do it any time I please!
[00:28:55.579 --> 00:28:58.622]  You understand that, you scumbag New World Order filth?
[00:29:00.097 --> 00:29:01.138]  Good!
[00:29:01.138 --> 00:29:05.221]  Unbelievable how they sit there and play people like a fiddle!
[00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:10.006]  How they sit there and manipulate everybody and I, for one, am sick and tired of it!
[00:29:10.953 --> 00:29:12.935]  Now I'm not going to get much more mad today, folks.
[00:29:12.935 --> 00:29:15.117]  The people praying to Obama.
[00:29:15.117 --> 00:29:19.140]  The media trying to make him some kind of, you know, god-like dictator and all this crud.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.103]  While the military trains to take on conservatives and libertarians.
[00:29:22.103 --> 00:29:23.705]  This country's in danger!
[00:29:23.705 --> 00:29:24.765]  Now I need to conserve my energy.
[00:29:24.765 --> 00:29:26.627]  I got a bunch of guests coming up and a lot of news today.
[00:29:26.627 --> 00:29:29.370]  And believe me, I'm not putting on an act here upset on air.
[00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:30.971]  I was blowing up during the break.
[00:29:30.971 --> 00:29:32.252]  God help me!
[00:29:32.252 --> 00:29:35.915]  Does anybody else get concerned about what's going on here?
[00:29:37.248 --> 00:29:39.209]  All the news straight ahead!
[00:29:39.209 --> 00:29:40.029]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:41.490]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.

[00:29:53.674 --> 00:29:56.375]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:17.685 --> 00:33:22.324]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.273 --> 00:33:48.683]  Ladies and gentlemen, if there is a opposite side of the universe from NPR and the attempt to brainwash you and put you into a trance with hypnotism, we're it.
[00:33:48.683 --> 00:33:50.864]  I am the polar opposite of NPR.
[00:33:50.864 --> 00:34:01.292]  They promote collectivism, communism, socialism, corporate cronyism, lies, deceit, division, fraud, scamming, sucking off taxpayers.
[00:34:01.292 --> 00:34:03.013]  We support the opposite of that.
[00:34:04.637 --> 00:34:16.354]  And I do get wound up in here, because I read news for hours at night, hours in the morning, and then I go exercise, I come into work, and then I just blow up on air a lot.
[00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:17.155]  It really does happen.
[00:34:18.072 --> 00:34:21.275]  And I need to settle down and cover the news here.
[00:34:21.275 --> 00:34:32.623]  It's just that it really gets to me to see what an authoritarian country we're turning into and how the system wants to put out the message that you don't talk about government, that that's somehow unpatriotic.
[00:34:32.623 --> 00:34:41.070]  If you're a radio listener, I had a plastic mask of the so-called person that is the front man for the globalists as they dismantle the country.
[00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.032]  And I'm very upset about the country being dismantled.
[00:34:43.692 --> 00:34:47.695]  I'm very upset about them shutting off our energy systems, our industrial systems.
[00:34:47.695 --> 00:34:52.899]  This is acts of war by the globalists, on record, post-industrial operation.
[00:34:52.899 --> 00:35:09.812]  And seeing my country destroyed and conquered is very painful, so that we can all be collectivized and be turned into slaves, and to watch them pass unconstitutional laws so you can't get your money out of the country, or where citizens can't even leave if they say you, quote, aren't allowed to, without even having
[00:35:10.822 --> 00:35:13.845]  An indictment or a crime.
[00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:16.908]  The country is shutting down on every front.
[00:35:16.908 --> 00:35:25.496]  But the movie theaters are still open, there's still all the entertainment and all the distractions in the toxic culture and it really hurts me, it really gets to me.
[00:35:25.496 --> 00:35:31.421]  But here is Barack Obama and I tore up a plastic mask of our king.
[00:35:33.769 --> 00:35:39.811]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, Barack Obama is not my king, he is not my master, he is not my lord.
[00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:44.053]  He is nothing but a mask of the globalist to bring in their world government.
[00:35:44.053 --> 00:35:49.055]  And I have sworn total resistance to it!
[00:35:49.055 --> 00:35:59.539]  And I'm sorry if, like a race car sometimes, I shoot my RPMs up and blow an engine on air, but I appreciate everybody joining us.
[00:35:59.539 --> 00:36:02.800]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I am now Obama-lector.
[00:36:04.841 --> 00:36:10.744]  CJ's saying I look like Hannibal Lecter now with the lower mandible of Barack Obama on my face.
[00:36:10.744 --> 00:36:14.526]  I think we've created a new character where Obama tells you the truth.
[00:36:14.526 --> 00:36:18.888]  Hi, this is Barack Obama without my teleprompter.
[00:36:18.888 --> 00:36:30.854]  I was raised by the Ford Foundation and Carnegie Endowment, part of a program of over a thousand children raised with one of them targeted to be president as a front man to bring in the collapse of the United States.
[00:36:31.534 --> 00:36:38.763]  I am the expression of a hundred year robber baron pilgrim to finally bring the United States to its knees.
[00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:45.291]  Soon all of you will learn to serve the collectivization.
[00:36:45.291 --> 00:36:46.873]  Because it's liberal.
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:37:10.096]  As I double the funding for forced abortions in China and Africa, as we move forward with the sterilization via Gardasil in Mexico, I will be praised by all the minority organizations and groups because we fund them from the start through the Rockefeller Foundation in 1910, and we control them now, and nothing will stop our operation.
[00:37:10.096 --> 00:37:16.001]  Because we do it in a trendy, loving way.
[00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:17.262]  You guys like the new outfit?
[00:37:18.715 --> 00:37:23.977]  Maybe I should, maybe I should host the whole show with our new friend.
[00:37:23.977 --> 00:37:30.839]  And if you want to see what I'm talking about, go to InfoWars.com forward slash show to find the free video feed right there.
[00:37:30.839 --> 00:37:34.200]  I think we should have more visits with our friend.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.621]  Obama took his mask off.
[00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:43.823]  He ripped the pieces aside and there was the New World Order technocrats who want to fight racism behind it.
[00:37:51.129 --> 00:37:56.933]  Remember to brush with fluoride, boys and girls, and take your shots!
[00:37:56.933 --> 00:38:01.755]  Obama loves you!
[00:38:01.755 --> 00:38:12.702]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:12.702 --> 00:38:15.204]  We are broadcasting worldwide here today.
[00:38:15.204 --> 00:38:16.765]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:38:16.765 --> 00:38:18.966]  I'll do whatever it takes to wake you up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:20.242 --> 00:38:24.404]  As they say in Full Metal Jacket, are you born again hard, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:38:24.404 --> 00:38:26.286]  Or are you a minion?
[00:38:26.286 --> 00:38:30.888]  Are you someone to be trampled underfoot by the globalists who think you're a joke?
[00:38:30.888 --> 00:38:33.910]  You know, one of the reasons I've been so upset, can we cue it up?
[00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:37.832]  Video of boy praise to Obama.
[00:38:37.832 --> 00:38:39.133]  I've done it now, folks.
[00:38:39.133 --> 00:38:42.955]  To this little boy, this would be like desecrating a crucifix.
[00:38:42.955 --> 00:38:48.879]  This would be like the Federal Department of Arts paying, what was it, a million dollars
[00:38:50.222 --> 00:38:59.664]  To have a group of displays smearing Catholic artifacts in different types of manure.
[00:38:59.664 --> 00:39:03.325]  You know, hundreds of thousands for crucifix and goblets of urine.
[00:39:03.325 --> 00:39:08.587]  Well, I mean, I just did something far worse for all the little minions out there.
[00:39:08.587 --> 00:39:14.788]  I desecrated their king, their lord, their master.
[00:39:14.788 --> 00:39:16.649]  And we have this video up on InfoWars.com
[00:39:18.134 --> 00:39:19.195]  It's up in the tiles.
[00:39:19.195 --> 00:39:21.297]  The easiest place to find it is DrudgeReport.com.
[00:39:21.297 --> 00:39:22.518]  Left-hand side.
[00:39:22.518 --> 00:39:23.038]  Video!
[00:39:23.038 --> 00:39:25.160]  Boy, praise to Obama!
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:38.873]  In a shocking video feature, a child seemingly praised for the Commander-in-Chief is sparking outrage from conservatives as well as more religious members of the public who view the boy's actions as possibly blasphemous.
[00:39:38.873 --> 00:39:39.694]  Well, it's not his fault.
[00:39:40.796 --> 00:39:48.340]  They teach people in all communist regimes where they have the little kids in kindergarten pray and ask for a school lunch.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.402]  Because you've been collectivized, the kids are half starving.
[00:39:52.402 --> 00:39:54.303]  They don't know they had more food before the communists came in.
[00:39:54.303 --> 00:39:55.784]  They just know they only get food if they pray.
[00:39:55.784 --> 00:39:58.625]  And you pray to Jesus, pray to Buddha, pray to whatever.
[00:39:58.625 --> 00:40:02.247]  They haven't prayed ever, even if it's in Asia, they haven't prayed to Buddha and it doesn't happen.
[00:40:02.247 --> 00:40:05.289]  Then they go, now pray to Ho Chi Minh.
[00:40:08.641 --> 00:40:16.747]  And then you pray and there is milk, there is oatmeal, there is porridge, there is eggs, there is food!
[00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:17.908]  And it's Pavlovian!
[00:40:17.908 --> 00:40:19.108]  You pray to the state!
[00:40:19.108 --> 00:40:26.414]  By the way, Paul Watson is going to post an article later about embedded messages in government videos where they have you pray to the state.
[00:40:26.414 --> 00:40:28.295]  And this is the type of stuff that goes on.
[00:40:28.295 --> 00:40:35.200]  And unless you think this is an isolated case, we have a bunch of other videos where you're taught to praise him and sing to him and pray to him.
[00:40:37.355 --> 00:40:42.539]  And on the signpost to perdition, on the signpost to tyranny, this is a big one.
[00:40:42.539 --> 00:40:53.087]  So let's go ahead and let's go now to the poor little boy uploaded on his parents' YouTube as they thank Obama.
[00:40:53.087 --> 00:40:58.411]  Looks like a pretty nice house, profiling it.
[00:40:58.411 --> 00:41:03.895]  I would guess that these folks are lower middle class, probably government workers.
[00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:14.011]  And you know, or they may be on welfare, but it looks like a little too nice for welfare unless there's something else going on there.
[00:41:14.011 --> 00:41:17.872]  But if you expand on that, isn't there a separation of church and state, the way they implement it?
[00:41:17.872 --> 00:41:19.953]  So that's a government-paid-for house?
[00:41:19.953 --> 00:41:21.613]  You're not supposed to have brain going on in it?
[00:41:21.613 --> 00:41:22.833]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:28.594]  Congress can make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the franchise thereof.
[00:41:28.594 --> 00:41:30.354]  That's the beginning of the First Amendment.
[00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:32.535]  Why are there hundreds of laws on religion in this country?
[00:41:33.533 --> 00:41:35.053]  Because it's all unconstitutional.
[00:41:35.053 --> 00:41:37.714]  How are they spying on us without warrants?
[00:41:37.714 --> 00:41:45.416]  Because we're under an emergency since 1933, when we went under receivership to JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs.
[00:41:45.416 --> 00:41:46.717]  Look up the paperwork.
[00:41:46.717 --> 00:41:52.598]  We've been under martial law, but we were so free, it's taken them 80 years to break us.
[00:41:52.598 --> 00:41:59.220]  80 years to get us from almost no one on welfare, and the wealthiest, fastest growing economy in the world, on average 12% growth rate,
[00:42:00.796 --> 00:42:07.859]  From 1789 until 1913, look up the numbers, the dollar lost almost none of its value.
[00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:13.340]  In fact, they had deflation a lot of the times that actually caused problems.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:17.242]  How'd you like a 12% growth rate instead of a 3% fake growth rate?
[00:42:17.242 --> 00:42:18.622]  How'd you like a blue-collar job?
[00:42:18.622 --> 00:42:21.043]  They've got all the studies in the 50s and 60s.
[00:42:21.043 --> 00:42:28.426]  Daddy could be a janitor and you lived at a house and could have two cars and go on three or four big vacations a year and put money in there for college.
[00:42:29.969 --> 00:42:33.970]  If Daddy was a janitor, hey, janitors, can you live like that now?
[00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:34.890]  No, you can't!
[00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.691]  Because we're being made like the third world.
[00:42:36.691 --> 00:42:38.011]  We're not lifting them up.
[00:42:38.011 --> 00:42:53.356]  If they had real programs to build power plants and build water systems, and then have the local government sign real contracts back, say, to a city, like, let's say Austin sponsored some city in Mexico, and they had real above-board programs to lift them up,
[00:42:54.298 --> 00:42:58.287]  Then I'd be for something like that if we voted for it, and if locally you voted for that.
[00:42:58.287 --> 00:42:59.269]  Because I want to lift people up.
[00:42:59.269 --> 00:43:00.451]  That's not what's happening.
[00:43:00.451 --> 00:43:04.520]  They go and they pay in the actuaries to break those cities and those societies down.
[00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:09.292]  Because they want to make you poor as a weapon of control.
[00:43:09.292 --> 00:43:11.593]  That's how the oligarchs operate.
[00:43:11.593 --> 00:43:13.435]  That's how feudalism operates.
[00:43:13.435 --> 00:43:16.257]  That's how it's operated for 6,000 years.
[00:43:16.257 --> 00:43:21.161]  And the Renaissance and the Enlightenment was the rebellion against that.
[00:43:21.161 --> 00:43:25.264]  And it's the only shot humanity's ever had at a free system of government.
[00:43:25.264 --> 00:43:28.207]  That's why the media spends all day bad-mouthing the Enlightenment.
[00:43:29.505 --> 00:43:36.328]  And the Renaissance, and our forebears, and pointing out the day and age they lived in, the bad things they were involved in.
[00:43:36.328 --> 00:43:43.912]  Yeah, they don't tell you though, compared to everybody else, they were the vanguard changing it.
[00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:57.899]  They don't ever want you to know that, folks, because if you ever discover those ideas, it's over for the elite that want to control everything, and want to keep your mind shackled, and want to keep you praying to an incredible betrayer.
[00:43:59.192 --> 00:44:13.205]  The health care bill was written by the big insurance companies owned by the mega banks on record to make 35 million people that didn't have insurance get it, to control what care you get, to make it cost more, give you less, and control what doctors can do, and make you dependent.
[00:44:13.996 --> 00:44:21.720]  And then bankrupt all the small HMOs and health care companies and groups and outlaw the more affordable health care plans.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.841]  And by the way, we're only a year into this.
[00:44:23.841 --> 00:44:28.704]  Premiums, according to Money Magazine, have already gone up 53% on average.
[00:44:28.704 --> 00:44:31.405]  Folks, they're going to double by the time they're done by 2015.
[00:44:31.405 --> 00:44:32.846]  That's on record.
[00:44:32.846 --> 00:44:34.907]  It's not going to be 53 or 52.
[00:44:34.907 --> 00:44:38.428]  It's going to be over 100%, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:38.428 --> 00:44:41.190]  It is going to devastate everyone.
[00:44:43.689 --> 00:44:48.891]  Hospitals are shutting down all over the country!
[00:44:48.891 --> 00:44:50.512]  The airlock's blown, folks!
[00:44:50.512 --> 00:44:51.412]  Tyranny's coming in!
[00:44:51.412 --> 00:44:52.833]  We're losing our atmosphere!
[00:44:52.833 --> 00:44:53.913]  Fast!
[00:44:53.913 --> 00:44:56.114]  Okay, that's what I'm trying to explain to everybody here.
[00:44:56.114 --> 00:44:57.634]  That's why I'm freaking out!
[00:44:57.634 --> 00:45:01.996]  We're seeing a total takeover with the military, and I gotta get to that, but let's play the little boy.
[00:45:01.996 --> 00:45:09.119]  Because he looks like a sweet little boy.
[00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:11.520]  And he's really there, praying,
[00:45:13.103 --> 00:45:17.867]  For Obama, and he flips back and forth like Obama's a man or is Obama God.
[00:45:17.867 --> 00:45:25.152]  And this is really sick, when Obama and the people that control him are putting fluoride in that little kid's water.
[00:45:25.152 --> 00:45:32.798]  They always say, we don't know why, but every major city that studies it, the minority areas have on average like double the fluoride, we don't know why.
[00:45:32.798 --> 00:45:33.639]  You don't know why?
[00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:38.252]  There's a eugenics cult running things.
[00:45:38.252 --> 00:45:43.374]  They want to stick him full of a bunch of shots, folks, so he is basically has a lower IQ.
[00:45:43.374 --> 00:45:44.395]  They want to do that to every child.
[00:45:44.395 --> 00:45:48.057]  I don't care what color the child is.
[00:45:48.057 --> 00:45:53.059]  And here he is under savage globalist attack as our power plants shut down, as our industry shuts down.
[00:45:53.059 --> 00:45:56.701]  And the only thing you can get is from the government when it gives it to you.
[00:45:56.701 --> 00:45:59.942]  And here he is praying to the government.
[00:45:59.942 --> 00:46:00.643]  Here's the audio.
[00:46:00.643 --> 00:46:01.223]  It's disgusting.
[00:46:07.233 --> 00:46:15.278]  Barack Obama, thank you for doing everything and all the kind stuff.
[00:46:15.278 --> 00:46:19.721]  Thank you for all the stuff that you helped us with.
[00:46:19.721 --> 00:46:27.066]  Thank you for taking the courage and responsibility for everything you have done for us.
[00:46:27.066 --> 00:46:32.430]  And God has gave you a special power.
[00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:33.470]  And you are
[00:46:37.401 --> 00:46:41.483]  I'm going to handle it just fine.
[00:46:41.483 --> 00:46:46.025]  You are good, Barack Obama.
[00:46:46.025 --> 00:46:48.946]  You are great.
[00:46:48.946 --> 00:46:53.948]  And when you get older, you will be able to do great things.
[00:46:53.948 --> 00:46:55.248]  Love, Stephen.
[00:46:55.248 --> 00:46:56.229]  Barack Obama!
[00:46:58.103 --> 00:46:59.624]  And then he hails Barack Obama.
[00:46:59.624 --> 00:47:02.464]  For some reason our computer's cutting off the very first word he says.
[00:47:02.464 --> 00:47:05.586]  I'm gonna pray Barack Obama.
[00:47:05.586 --> 00:47:07.206]  I'm gonna pray Barack Obama.
[00:47:07.206 --> 00:47:08.907]  So it's like, you're gonna pray for him?
[00:47:08.907 --> 00:47:10.607]  You're gonna pray to Barack Obama?
[00:47:10.607 --> 00:47:13.788]  I'm gonna pray Barack Obama.
[00:47:13.788 --> 00:47:19.150]  And that's nothing compared to... I mean, I've seen clips on the news where they go, he's like Christ, he's like Jesus, all this stuff.
[00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:21.631]  Let me tell you the special power Barack Obama has.
[00:47:23.325 --> 00:47:36.874]  He has the special power to put in federal regulations, even when Congress won't pass them, to put carbon taxes paid to private groups on every tank of gas, every watt of electricity you buy from the local power company.
[00:47:36.874 --> 00:47:40.376]  Most of the time it's been privatized and taken over.
[00:47:40.376 --> 00:47:46.440]  He has the power to put regulations in to shut down industry, and to bankrupt coal that supplied half our power.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:46.881]  Now it's like 40%.
[00:47:46.881 --> 00:47:48.922]  They're shutting it all down.
[00:47:48.922 --> 00:47:50.923]  And to have your power bills go up.
[00:47:50.923 --> 00:47:52.745]  And to ship General Motors to China.
[00:47:53.564 --> 00:47:56.285]  Paid to ship it, 21 million.
[00:47:56.285 --> 00:47:58.867]  This is the type of stuff that's going on.
[00:47:58.867 --> 00:48:08.491]  He's got the power with Al Gore on the board of Apple to make sure they have the lowest paid factories in China with suicide nets, forced abortions.
[00:48:08.491 --> 00:48:16.675]  He has the power to work with Pepsi in their flavor testing system to use fetal cells.
[00:48:16.675 --> 00:48:18.176]  In the Pepsi preparation.
[00:48:18.176 --> 00:48:19.397]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:21.898]  Yeah, little kid, he's got some power, alright.
[00:48:23.407 --> 00:48:26.231]  He's got the power to destroy this country.
[00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:29.976]  He's got the power to neutralize all the opposition.
[00:48:29.976 --> 00:48:32.240]  He's got the power to collectivize this nation.
[00:48:33.769 --> 00:48:39.094]  He's got the power to blame people when they die on the Second Amendment and collectively blame folks.
[00:48:39.094 --> 00:48:42.337]  He's got the power with his controllers to create racial division.
[00:48:42.337 --> 00:48:48.743]  And he's also got the power, this is just the news in the last hour, Atterbury to host terrorism response training.
[00:48:48.743 --> 00:48:50.105]  I saw this on the news.
[00:48:50.105 --> 00:48:54.249]  Blown up cars, burning gas stations, millions of dollars being spent.
[00:48:54.249 --> 00:48:55.610]  We have it queued up in the computer.
[00:48:59.249 --> 00:49:06.093]  Again, to create the simulant that there's terrorists everywhere while telling police that there's a real terror threat from Al-Qaeda that they actually run.
[00:49:06.093 --> 00:49:08.054]  And then here's another one by Kurt Nemo.
[00:49:08.054 --> 00:49:09.714]  That's out of Indiana.
[00:49:09.714 --> 00:49:10.135]  U.S.
[00:49:10.135 --> 00:49:15.677]  Army conducts military occupation drill in small town Wisconsin.
[00:49:15.677 --> 00:49:16.338]  Operation...
[00:49:18.982 --> 00:49:24.108]  Emulates military control of local elected officials.
[00:49:24.108 --> 00:49:24.468]  U.S.
[00:49:24.468 --> 00:49:28.413]  Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations, now that they're allowed to operate domestically.
[00:49:28.413 --> 00:49:30.255]  They've always been operating, but now it's open.
[00:49:30.255 --> 00:49:37.243]  Command Battalion recently practiced joint control of a small town with local authorities in a realistic training exercise.
[00:49:37.623 --> 00:49:53.934]  According to an article released by the Army, 22 soldiers from the 432nd Battalion unloaded their Humvees in Galette, Wisconsin and set up four operating base in the county fairgrounds in order to conduct assessments of some of the surrounding cities and meet with local key leaders.
[00:49:54.574 --> 00:50:06.799]  For the drill, the battalion apparently found it necessary to find a small rural community with complete working infrastructure such as garbage and recycling pickup, police and fire departments, parks, schools, doctors, dentists, chiropractors and optometrists.
[00:50:06.799 --> 00:50:11.761]  All of which would be difficult to find in a war-torn city in Iraq or Afghanistan.
[00:50:11.761 --> 00:50:13.942]  This is the Army speaking.
[00:50:13.942 --> 00:50:15.823]  We chose the city
[00:50:17.141 --> 00:50:25.039]  of Gillette for the first time this year because of the size demographics municipalities offer within the city and surrounding areas said Sergeant First Class
[00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:33.537]  Patrick Lyon, or Leon, the non-commissioned officer in charge of the Civilian Military Operations Center.
[00:50:33.537 --> 00:50:36.139]  It replicates what we may find in an overseas environment.
[00:50:36.139 --> 00:50:39.682]  Folks, we've caught them in these drills where they openly admit it's domestic.
[00:50:39.682 --> 00:50:42.685]  The Army Times admits it's for domestic operations.
[00:50:42.685 --> 00:50:45.327]  The Stars and Stripes admits it's for domestic operations.
[00:50:45.327 --> 00:50:49.511]  I have video of these where they admit it, but then they'll always tell the media it's not.
[00:50:49.511 --> 00:50:50.812]  They'll admit to themselves it is.
[00:50:51.753 --> 00:50:53.974]  In public documents, but then tell us it's not.
[00:50:53.974 --> 00:51:01.359]  Places like Arcadia, Iowa, they trained to confiscate guns, door to door, and admitted it.
[00:51:01.359 --> 00:51:03.760]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:11.485]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:51:11.485 --> 00:51:16.428]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:51:16.428 --> 00:51:18.589]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:20.130]  If every one of us who can,
[00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.910]  We're good to go.

[00:54:00.683 --> 00:54:02.905]  Woah, boom bop ba boom.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:16.524]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[00:54:16.524 --> 00:54:24.650]  I want to hit some other news before we get Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs in studio.
[00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:26.452]  What a great guy in person.
[00:54:38.297 --> 00:54:47.525]  You can say whatever you want about these illegal wars that are wrong, but I just tell you, when I run into the veterans and people that have been through the flames of adversity, they're just always real people.
[00:54:47.525 --> 00:54:49.967]  That's what I like about veterans especially.
[00:54:49.967 --> 00:54:56.513]  That's why the globalists hate them so much, because they know they're not cowards, and they know about the BS.
[00:54:56.513 --> 00:54:57.394]  The Bravo Sierra.
[00:54:59.215 --> 00:55:04.000]  He was telling us yesterday about government drug dealing, you name it, over in Afghanistan.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.463]  We're going to get him in studio coming up.
[00:55:06.463 --> 00:55:09.266]  Stuff he saw, the DEA, you name it.
[00:55:09.266 --> 00:55:12.029]  Believe me, they're not going to like this.
[00:55:12.029 --> 00:55:18.896]  So, we're going to wake some people up out there today with Michael Hastings, good buddy.
[00:55:19.847 --> 00:55:22.028]  And he's been in the Army a long time, too.
[00:55:22.028 --> 00:55:24.388]  A lot of tours.
[00:55:24.388 --> 00:55:26.669]  He was telling me just some of the stuff he was in.
[00:55:26.669 --> 00:55:31.650]  He didn't like to talk about it, but I got him to tell some of the stories just to let people know what goes on over there.
[00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:33.691]  And he was talking about when they found a real Al Qaeda base.
[00:55:33.691 --> 00:55:36.951]  I'm going to get him to tell that, because we haven't aired this yet.
[00:55:36.951 --> 00:55:37.872]  It's for Obama Deception 2.
[00:55:37.872 --> 00:55:41.092]  And I'm going to get him to say it all on air today for our own safety.
[00:55:43.584 --> 00:55:45.184]  Oh yeah, they're real terrorists too, by the way.
[00:55:45.184 --> 00:55:46.485]  They're not all just synthetics.
[00:55:46.485 --> 00:55:50.486]  We're going to get Staff Sergeant Biggs to break some of that down for you.
[00:55:50.486 --> 00:55:53.067]  Coming up, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:55:53.067 --> 00:55:54.587]  Again, that's coming up in the next hour.

[00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:56.933]  And don't forget, we are now carrying the film exclusively, American Drug War 2.
[00:56:56.933 --> 00:57:02.236]  You know, the last one aired on Showtime and a bunch of other channels, and then HBO later.
[00:57:02.236 --> 00:57:05.358]  But the point is, this new one hasn't even aired on TV yet.
[00:57:05.358 --> 00:57:08.160]  We have, I think it airs in like next week or something.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.402]  The point is, is Kevin Booth, this is like four or five years in the making.
[00:57:11.402 --> 00:57:13.503]  The last one took five years to make.
[00:57:13.503 --> 00:57:14.704]  This film made me cry.
[00:57:15.592 --> 00:57:16.613]  Or tear up a bit.
[00:57:16.613 --> 00:57:21.376]  Because it's about the CPS grabbing kids, pot smokers, that's a part of the film.
[00:57:21.376 --> 00:57:25.959]  It's about how they then put the kids on all these deadly psychotropics and how it hurts the children.
[00:57:25.959 --> 00:57:27.100]  That's just part of it.
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:28.821]  It's a very powerful film.
[00:57:28.821 --> 00:57:31.363]  It's got big extras in it as well.
[00:57:31.363 --> 00:57:37.707]  The Wall Street Journal said this film is a game-changing moment for both the film and entertainment industry as well as the cannabis industry.
[00:57:37.707 --> 00:57:38.508]  The Wall Street Journal.
[00:57:39.758 --> 00:57:42.879]  That's just some of the rave reviews.
[00:57:42.879 --> 00:57:49.542]  This is no just run-of-the-mill film, and we are the exclusive distributor of the DVD.

[00:57:55.444 --> 00:58:03.708]  If you want to understand the whole cannabis culture and where it's going and how the government is using it as a pretext for total takeover, Kevin goes inside the
[00:58:05.731 --> 00:58:11.983]  The Emerald Triangle in Northern California to the giant weed growing operations that the police know full well about.
[00:58:11.983 --> 00:58:13.285]  Let me tell ya.
[00:58:13.973 --> 00:58:16.335]  The local police are getting their cut.
[00:58:16.335 --> 00:58:20.397]  The feds are the ones shutting them all down because they don't like marijuana because they can't control it.
[00:58:20.397 --> 00:58:26.161]  They like heroin, cocaine, Prozac, and other derivatives they can put your kids on publicly.
[00:58:26.161 --> 00:58:29.604]  So, again, American Drug War 2.

[00:58:54.756 --> 00:58:56.016]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:56.016 --> 00:58:59.938]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.938 --> 00:59:02.178]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.178 --> 00:59:08.040]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:14.262]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.702 --> 00:59:20.687]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.687 --> 00:59:24.850]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:29.153]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.153 --> 00:59:35.097]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.097 --> 00:59:38.660]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.621]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.621 --> 00:59:41.062]  It's here.

[00:59:55.942 --> 00:59:58.745]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:10.044]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.044 --> 01:00:11.625]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:13.166]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:17.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.368 --> 01:00:21.450]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.653 --> 01:00:42.058]  Well, the federal eugenics-based government launched an investigation of their own armed Planned Parenthood to cover up all of the bloody death mills around the country, where they're selling the baby parts and stuff.
[01:00:42.058 --> 01:00:46.360]  They just want to help them clean it up and learn how to conduct criminal operations a little bit better.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.881]  That story's up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:48.881 --> 01:00:55.044]  Benghazi whistleblower lawyer stolen Libyan missiles will be used to shoot down aircraft.
[01:00:55.044 --> 01:00:57.165]  That's a pretty big little news tidbit.
[01:00:57.165 --> 01:00:58.126]  You've been hearing us say that for
[01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:01.707]  Two years now, but now it's mainstream news.
[01:01:01.707 --> 01:01:07.531]  And Snowden, after 9-11, media advocated its role as a check to power.
[01:01:07.531 --> 01:01:11.153]  That's exactly what Michael Hastings said that got him blown up.
[01:01:11.153 --> 01:01:19.717]  And speaking of Michael Hastings, Michael Hastings was investigating CIA Director John Brennan.
[01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:23.339]  So we've got that important report coming up.
[01:01:23.339 --> 01:01:27.061]  Also, Obama appoints Fox to investigate spying in the henhouse.
[01:01:27.061 --> 01:01:27.942]  He's hired Clapper.
[01:01:29.513 --> 01:01:30.594]  Uh, how do you know when he's lying?
[01:01:30.594 --> 01:01:31.654]  When he's flappin' his clapper.
[01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:35.537]  Uh, flappin' his, flappin' his jaw.
[01:01:35.537 --> 01:01:36.817]  Uh, over there.
[01:01:36.817 --> 01:01:41.380]  Clapper is the guy that told Congress that they do not collect any debt on Americans.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.241]  And a day later it was a lie.
[01:01:43.643 --> 01:01:45.964]  And they all talk in that fake NPR voice.
[01:01:45.964 --> 01:01:48.286]  Hi, just bend over, this won't hurt.
[01:01:48.286 --> 01:01:51.028]  I'm putting this razor blade to your neck to help you.
[01:01:51.028 --> 01:01:52.969]  I'm slicing through your arteries to be friendly.
[01:01:52.969 --> 01:01:55.871]  Does that feel good, that warm blood?
[01:01:55.871 --> 01:01:57.812]  Dripping, spurting.
[01:01:57.812 --> 01:01:59.934]  Let me drink some of that, I love you.
[01:01:59.934 --> 01:02:08.219]  Newly discovered 8th grade exam from 1912 shows how dumbed down America has become another superb article by American Dream.
[01:02:08.219 --> 01:02:11.001]  We are Legion, anonymous presence in the US military.
[01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:16.043]  They're systematically destroying our independence and making us all economic serfs.
[01:02:16.043 --> 01:02:17.464]  Very important article.
[01:02:17.464 --> 01:02:19.245]  That's some of what we're going to be getting to.
[01:02:19.245 --> 01:02:27.689]  And the nightmares that are... Oh, Slimacare.
[01:02:27.689 --> 01:02:28.750]  Oh, Vomit.
[01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:30.631]  I'm trying to think of the proper name for Obama.
[01:02:32.842 --> 01:02:33.883]  Oh, vomit?
[01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:35.725]  He does vomit lies on people.
[01:02:35.725 --> 01:02:37.687]  They're like baby birds.
[01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:40.250]  They go out and just go, vomit on me!
[01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:42.512]  And he just vomits poisonous lies on them.
[01:02:42.512 --> 01:02:46.396]  And they roll over and get little X's in their eyes.
[01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:52.823]  And then the mommy owl pets them and puts them, you know, in their little hole that's ready to rot.
[01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:56.699]  There'll be little baby skeletons in there.
[01:02:56.699 --> 01:02:59.241]  Should we give Obama the name O-Vomit?
[01:02:59.241 --> 01:03:03.044]  Because even though he's just a puppet, it's important to defile the puppet.
[01:03:03.044 --> 01:03:07.768]  That's why they tell you you're not allowed to have a rodeo clown of O-Vomit.
[01:03:07.768 --> 01:03:10.290]  I gotta admit, I didn't coin O-Vomit.
[01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:12.771]  I saw it in the comments this morning.
[01:03:12.771 --> 01:03:20.177]  Do you guys, are you guys partially kind of, kind of have like a crush on the term O-Vomit?
[01:03:20.177 --> 01:03:21.318]  The parrot press media?
[01:03:23.663 --> 01:03:25.484]  The parrot toots?
[01:03:25.484 --> 01:03:29.946]  I don't know what you, it's like a, what do you call a flock of prostitute press people?
[01:03:29.946 --> 01:03:31.527]  The parrot toots.
[01:03:31.527 --> 01:03:32.908]  I don't know, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:32.908 --> 01:03:36.490]  I'm just, I'm just out of control here today.
[01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:41.132]  Unsealed court settlement documents reveal banks stole trillions worth of houses.
[01:03:41.132 --> 01:03:43.093]  Oh my gosh, that's now mainstream news.
[01:03:43.093 --> 01:03:44.554]  We'll be getting to that.
[01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:47.175]  You mean there's foreign banks that steal trillions?
[01:03:47.175 --> 01:03:48.076]  Everyone I know
[01:03:49.642 --> 01:03:56.715]  Has their phone companies, their power companies, whether it's city or private, every credit card company, everyone.
[01:03:56.715 --> 01:03:58.398]  This happens to us now.
[01:03:58.398 --> 01:03:59.881]  And we have debit cards and it happens.
[01:03:59.881 --> 01:04:01.784]  Even though I try to use cash most of the time.
[01:04:03.462 --> 01:04:08.084]  They all just, you know, you have an unlimited minutes contract, unlimited data contract with AT&T.
[01:04:08.084 --> 01:04:08.604]  They don't care.
[01:04:08.604 --> 01:04:10.125]  They just, oh, here's a $500 bill, bud.
[01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:11.405]  Ain't like that.
[01:04:11.405 --> 01:04:15.967]  And my parents are smart folks, but they're even less tech savvy than I am.
[01:04:15.967 --> 01:04:17.448]  And they're like, it's strange.
[01:04:17.448 --> 01:04:24.811]  They won't, Target won't send me a statement for a year, and they just keep all these weird charges, so I don't use the card.
[01:04:24.811 --> 01:04:27.112]  And I tell them to cancel it, and they won't.
[01:04:27.112 --> 01:04:29.353]  I go, you gotta send them registered mail, and you gotta have to sue them.
[01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:32.132]  Even Clark Howard will tell you that.
[01:04:32.132 --> 01:04:38.555]  My parents are like, you mean, I go, yeah, you're in a database as people to rip off.
[01:04:38.555 --> 01:04:42.257]  My parents, it's hard to say my parents are old, but they, you know, they're old now.
[01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:43.398]  But it's everybody.
[01:04:43.398 --> 01:04:49.942]  Paul Watson in England, he says, no, every company, everybody, he'll have unlimited, he'll have the contract, he has to sit there for hours.
[01:04:49.942 --> 01:04:57.086]  My crew, every, at their lunch break, sit there battling fake credit card bills because it's just, it's criminals.
[01:04:57.086 --> 01:04:59.307]  I mean, the government, the corporations are criminals.
[01:05:01.252 --> 01:05:03.334]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:11.382]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:05:11.382 --> 01:05:16.307]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:05:16.307 --> 01:05:18.489]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:05:18.489 --> 01:05:19.070]  If everyone
[01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:19.931]  We're good to go.

[01:06:00.325 --> 01:06:04.186]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:06:04.186 --> 01:06:09.707]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:06:09.707 --> 01:06:17.428]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:06:17.428 --> 01:06:26.550]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:33.921]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:06:33.921 --> 01:06:36.805]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:06:36.805 --> 01:06:42.753]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[01:06:43.454 --> 01:06:44.035]  War.
[01:06:44.035 --> 01:06:45.356]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:06:45.356 --> 01:06:46.657]  Another plane just hit!

[01:08:10.316 --> 01:08:11.897]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.897 --> 01:08:13.437]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:17.638]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.638 --> 01:08:21.699]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:35.299 --> 01:08:39.885]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday, the 13th day of August.
[01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:50.705]  2013 and we're joined for the balance of the hour by Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs who served two tours in Afghanistan and one in Iraq.
[01:08:50.705 --> 01:08:57.510]  A lot of really interesting stories you can tell to give you the perspective of a soldier and really likable guy like all the combat soldiers I've gotten to know.
[01:08:57.510 --> 01:09:04.676]  I don't think I've met any of them that weren't really nice down-to-earth people who also weren't naive because of what they've seen in country.
[01:09:05.276 --> 01:09:16.301]  It's like a lot of my family are veterans of combat and special operations type things and they're just like, of course the government ships in the drugs, of course big banks launder money, of course all this is going on because they saw it.
[01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:18.462]  Going back to Vietnam, you name it.
[01:09:18.462 --> 01:09:30.067]  It's only the naive public that really doesn't know what's going on but he's gonna tell us some of those stories about the DEA and some of the shady stuff he saw that really primed him to know what was happening and maybe even tell the story about how he, you know,
[01:09:30.447 --> 01:09:30.827]  I think so.
[01:09:48.902 --> 01:10:00.726]  That Michael Hastings was investigating CIA Director John Brennan, and there's also other intel he's got from his sources of some of the other friends there with Michael Hastings when he died.
[01:10:00.726 --> 01:10:11.370]  It's a big deal when an award-winning journalist who says he's going into hiding and on the run, and less than 24 hours later his car blows up and then we're told, move along, it's no big deal, nothing to see here.
[01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:12.630]  That is a big deal.
[01:10:14.431 --> 01:10:19.657]  So we're going to talk about that with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs at the bottom of the hour.
[01:10:19.657 --> 01:10:21.959]  Buddy, it's good to have you here and meet you in person.
[01:10:21.959 --> 01:10:22.920]  Yeah, it's great to be here.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.921]  Thanks for having me.
[01:10:23.921 --> 01:10:25.723]  What do you think of the InfoWars operation?
[01:10:25.723 --> 01:10:26.504]  It's pretty neat.
[01:10:26.504 --> 01:10:28.946]  It's a lot bigger than I expected.
[01:10:28.946 --> 01:10:30.368]  It's pretty intense.
[01:10:30.368 --> 01:10:31.969]  Everyone's pretty motivated and dedicated.
[01:10:31.969 --> 01:10:32.450]  I like it.
[01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:33.611]  They're an incredible crew.
[01:10:33.611 --> 01:10:36.274]  And not every TV radio studio has 50 cows.
[01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:36.574]  Yeah.
[01:10:37.435 --> 01:10:40.237]  I definitely got to hold on to two of those yesterday.
[01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:42.198]  That was pretty ice.
[01:10:42.198 --> 01:10:45.120]  Next time you're down, we gotta go out and do some shooting.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:45.680]  Definitely.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.061]  I'll be done with Obama deception and it'll be a little bit cooler.
[01:10:48.061 --> 01:10:49.362]  Not that you can't handle heat.
[01:10:49.362 --> 01:10:53.124]  Where was the hottest place you ever served?
[01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:54.525]  Kuwait's definitely the hottest place.
[01:10:54.525 --> 01:10:56.646]  I didn't serve there, but you stopped due there.
[01:10:56.646 --> 01:10:58.427]  It is a toasty place.
[01:10:58.427 --> 01:11:03.510]  It goes from about 120 down to about 60 degrees at night, so that's a huge temperature change.
[01:11:04.778 --> 01:11:06.940]  It definitely shocks your system a bit.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.182]  I bet.
[01:11:08.182 --> 01:11:16.050]  Yesterday, I wasn't really intending to get into this stuff with you for the film interview, but you started getting into how you started to really wake up.
[01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:22.116]  Tell folks some of the shady things, without getting anything quote classified, that you witnessed.
[01:11:22.116 --> 01:11:25.860]  I mean, you perfectly described it how they'd have you as a diversion over here.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:39.744]  And then meanwhile, this would be going over here with the DEA and how some of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda you were saying was fake, but then some of it was real, that amazing story about the phone books in the walls with the list of who they were going to kill in the U.S.
[01:11:39.744 --> 01:11:42.605]  I mean, you've got the floor, Staff Sergeant Biggs.
[01:11:42.605 --> 01:11:46.286]  Break down your service, what you did, and some of the things you witnessed.
[01:11:46.826 --> 01:11:57.288]  Well, when I joined, I joined with the intentions that most people or most guys did when they went in, you know, serve your country, you know, no one, you know, I at that point never thought that there was anything wrong with America.
[01:11:57.288 --> 01:12:04.910]  I was just gung-ho about it and I was pretty blinded by, you know, this whole perfect nation that I thought we had.
[01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:09.071]  Repeat how you walked into the places and what you said.
[01:12:09.071 --> 01:12:10.071]  Well, I woke up
[01:12:11.056 --> 01:12:12.817]  This one morning, I was like, you know, I'm going to go do it.
[01:12:12.817 --> 01:12:16.138]  So I go into the recruiter office.
[01:12:16.138 --> 01:12:17.258]  I said, I want Iraq.
[01:12:17.258 --> 01:12:18.218]  I want combat.
[01:12:18.218 --> 01:12:19.739]  And I want to go there as fast as possible.
[01:12:19.739 --> 01:12:20.619]  What can you do?
[01:12:20.619 --> 01:12:24.000]  And the recruiter looked at me and he goes, well, you just made my job a lot easier.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.341]  I said, I just want to do this.
[01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:26.161]  I need to get it done.
[01:12:26.161 --> 01:12:27.862]  It's something I have to do.
[01:12:27.862 --> 01:12:31.683]  And next thing you know, I was a basic training and then off to Iraq just a few months later.
[01:12:31.683 --> 01:12:33.724]  So.
[01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:34.904]  Yeah, that was it.
[01:12:34.904 --> 01:12:40.186]  Let's get into the shadiness and we'll get into some of the IED stories and stuff, but tell folks some of the first shady things you saw.
[01:12:40.916 --> 01:12:49.649]  Well definitely, one of the missions, there are real terrorists out there, a lot of people think that's kind of a fake thing, and they're not really out there, it's just us making that up.
[01:12:49.649 --> 01:12:56.459]  I went on a mission personally, and from what we were told, it was just an IED making facility, which is an improvised explosive device.
[01:12:57.583 --> 01:13:03.589]  And what we found out when we got there was it was a lot more than that.
[01:13:03.589 --> 01:13:12.118]  I would go through with the metal scanners, and we weren't finding anything on the floor, so we started going up on the walls and started getting some reeds.
[01:13:12.118 --> 01:13:17.223]  So we started busting in through the walls, started finding shrapnel, passports.
[01:13:18.164 --> 01:13:25.590]  Money, explosives, phone books, a New York City phone book with, you know, names circled in it, all kinds of stuff.
[01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.211]  I mean, these guys had the money.
[01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:31.326]  And you said it was public figures and government people.
[01:13:31.326 --> 01:13:38.088]  Yeah, I mean they had the means to do something and luckily we were able to find that and stop those people from that.
[01:13:38.088 --> 01:13:41.328]  But specifically the type of shrapnel, tell them what was in the phone books.
[01:13:41.328 --> 01:13:44.209]  In the phone books, people you would hear on the news a lot.
[01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:48.730]  I mean names like that, stuff like government officials, people like that that were circled in there.
[01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:53.110]  The stuff, the types of materials they had were glass, like marbles.
[01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:55.951]  So if something did hit you, the shrapnel would go into your body.
[01:13:56.771 --> 01:13:59.414]  And if they scanned you, they couldn't find anything.
[01:13:59.414 --> 01:14:02.657]  So, you know, it was just a silent killer right there.
[01:14:02.657 --> 01:14:04.779]  Yeah, because it's even hard, I guess, to get the metal out.
[01:14:04.779 --> 01:14:05.539]  Yeah.
[01:14:05.539 --> 01:14:06.500]  You've been a victim of that.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:06.781]  Yeah.
[01:14:07.942 --> 01:14:22.251]  Um, another one, we, uh, we would get times where the DEA would come and stay with us and be embedded with us and go out on missions and they would just be kind of, you know, we weren't allowed to talk to them until there was time to.
[01:14:22.251 --> 01:14:29.616]  When they did speak up, we would sometimes be asked to go down to opium fields and try to, you know, cut them down.
[01:14:29.616 --> 01:14:31.057]  Other times we were told to guard them.
[01:14:32.725 --> 01:14:37.847]  You know, and, you know, they would have us cutting down fields and then they would have us guarding ones.
[01:14:37.847 --> 01:14:39.868]  And that was just, I always thought that was kind of weird.
[01:14:39.868 --> 01:14:49.893]  That's what I've been told by a family that was in Columbia just a few years ago, that they have GPS grids where they spray the people that don't want their money with the right banks.
[01:14:49.893 --> 01:14:58.757]  And of course they had public meetings in Columbia back in 99 where they sent the Grasso, the head of the stock exchange, went down and met with the head of the FARC and said, you invest with us or we kill all your fields and invade.
[01:14:59.557 --> 01:15:02.864]  And then they didn't, so they kill their fields and grow it and ship it in.
[01:15:03.936 --> 01:15:10.361]  Yeah, there was always, you know, like I was saying, like there was this going on, what we thought we were doing, which is winning the hearts and minds.
[01:15:10.361 --> 01:15:15.805]  And then, you know, we had these, you know, operators that were doing something else on the back side.
[01:15:15.805 --> 01:15:20.368]  So we were this cover mission, and then these guys were kind of off in the back doing other things as well.
[01:15:20.368 --> 01:15:21.449]  Was it mainly DEA?
[01:15:21.449 --> 01:15:22.850]  I mean, what would happen after you'd guarded?
[01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:27.414]  Because from what they've admitted, they would then process it, then ship it out, and it was flown out.
[01:15:27.414 --> 01:15:32.458]  Well, a lot of times we would capture the people there that ran that, and then they would take them back and interrogate them.
[01:15:33.496 --> 01:15:34.516]  Maybe shake them down.
[01:15:34.516 --> 01:15:35.176]  I mean, who knows?
[01:15:35.176 --> 01:15:40.858]  We weren't really allowed to get close enough to hear what they were saying, but all you could hear was screaming.
[01:15:40.858 --> 01:15:42.218]  You could definitely hear that.
[01:15:42.218 --> 01:15:43.099]  So, torture?
[01:15:43.099 --> 01:15:44.899]  Yeah.
[01:15:44.899 --> 01:15:49.180]  It's something, after hearing that, it's something I never wanted to be a part of, I tell you that.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.060]  How were they torturing them?
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.581]  Waterboarding or pulling fingernails out?
[01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:53.121]  I mean, like I said, I was outside the building.
[01:15:53.121 --> 01:15:56.982]  All I could hear was just that, you know, so that alone, just the screams from a person.
[01:15:56.982 --> 01:15:59.603]  I was told DEA uses electricity in little crank deals.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.841]  Anything was possible at that point.
[01:16:02.841 --> 01:16:06.801]  I mean, the yells that I heard, I've heard people get shot and I've never heard that yell before.
[01:16:06.801 --> 01:16:15.283]  I've heard people, you know, scream from being stabbed and the yells I heard from a person, those were just ungodly.
[01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:19.024]  And they were wanting to know, I guess, where the stashes were buried, too.
[01:16:19.024 --> 01:16:22.045]  That's worth a lot of money going in our daughter's arms here in the U.S.
[01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:25.186]  I've got to ship that in immediately.
[01:16:25.186 --> 01:16:26.426]  How often would they torture people?
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.182]  Um, it wasn't like real often, maybe every few months.
[01:16:30.182 --> 01:16:35.827]  It's just whatever kind of intel they would get, they would use us for covers to go run missions.
[01:16:35.827 --> 01:16:37.628]  And they would be like, oh, you know, we need to go over here.
[01:16:37.628 --> 01:16:39.549]  You know, we just have to let them go do their thing.
[01:16:39.549 --> 01:16:41.011]  By the way, that's breaking news.
[01:16:41.011 --> 01:16:45.534]  So you would see DEA take farmers in and then torture them?
[01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:46.315]  Well, I mean, they would.
[01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:50.677]  Wouldn't call them farmers, you know, they would be like, these are Taliban people.
[01:16:50.677 --> 01:16:57.661]  And you know, these guys would come in and they're all bearded up guys, you know, wearing all black, you know, special tactical gear and all that stuff.
[01:16:57.661 --> 01:17:00.783]  And they would take him in there and interrogate him and do whatever.
[01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:01.583]  Were they CIA?
[01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:02.544]  Were they Navy SEALs?
[01:17:02.544 --> 01:17:09.328]  We were told DEA and then the other term they used was OGA, other government, you know, other government agencies.
[01:17:09.848 --> 01:17:15.495]  Sure, to be clear, but I can show clips of Fox, CNN going, here's the Marine Corps commander, he helps grow the opium.
[01:17:15.495 --> 01:17:16.877]  Yes, these are just farmers.
[01:17:16.877 --> 01:17:21.042]  So they would call one group farmers, and the other group they would call terrorists.
[01:17:21.042 --> 01:17:24.846]  My point is, is that how long would the torturing go on for?
[01:17:24.846 --> 01:17:26.328]  About an hour or so.
[01:17:26.328 --> 01:17:29.692]  And then they would tell us to take, you know, control over that population.
[01:17:31.015 --> 01:17:31.095]  No.
[01:17:56.294 --> 01:17:57.856]  No, because the Army report says they did.
[01:17:57.856 --> 01:17:58.997]  Oh, it's possible.
[01:17:58.997 --> 01:18:09.628]  I mean, there was definitely a group of kids I would have liked to have seen going in there one time, because three kids marched a suicide bomber up to our gate, and the guy went off and almost killed quite a good bit of them.
[01:18:09.628 --> 01:18:09.968]  Really?
[01:18:09.968 --> 01:18:11.229]  Yeah, and those kids just took off.
[01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:18.357]  They act like... Because we saw them sitting there walking with this guy up to the gate, and these kids were kids we've seen the whole time we were there, so they seem friendly kids.
[01:18:18.917 --> 01:18:22.781]  They walk up with this guy holding his hands and they're all just like, oh, you know, we've known this guy forever.
[01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:28.226]  Next thing you know, the kids run off, the guy throws a grenade and pulls a string and blows up.
[01:18:28.226 --> 01:18:30.768]  All I could see was his scalp just floating down.
[01:18:30.768 --> 01:18:34.071]  Wow.
[01:18:34.071 --> 01:18:38.095]  You know, the social engineers love war because it corrupts everybody.
[01:18:38.095 --> 01:18:39.457]  Yeah.
[01:18:39.457 --> 01:18:42.680]  It's definitely not meant for everybody.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.580]  It's a hard job to
[01:18:44.642 --> 01:18:59.067]  To go over there and, you know, like I said, you go over with these pure intentions, but at the end of the day, truly all you want to do is get home, and you just care about your buddies getting home, and it kind of, you know, you're not all this, you know, God bless America, this and that, you know.
[01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:06.590]  Right now, it's at this point where there's so many bad things going on that you see, you're just kind of sick of it, and all you can do is just look at your buddy and be like, man, I just hope we make it out of this.
[01:19:07.779 --> 01:19:10.062]  You know, that is cultural mind control, though.
[01:19:10.062 --> 01:19:18.871]  You don't even have to put them in a CIA mind control base to make them blow themselves up, to blow yourself up, to try to, you know, kill people.
[01:19:18.871 --> 01:19:21.054]  It just shows a high level of control.
[01:19:21.054 --> 01:19:25.078]  The media always calls them cowards, but for me, I don't think that's cowardly.
[01:19:25.078 --> 01:19:27.041]  I don't like what they're doing, but I don't think it's cowardly.
[01:19:27.614 --> 01:19:28.315]  No, it's not cowardly.
[01:19:28.315 --> 01:19:33.598]  I mean, it definitely takes some cojones to be able to strap a bomb to yourself and, you know, be able to say that goodbye.
[01:19:33.598 --> 01:19:35.659]  You know you're not gonna see your family again.
[01:19:35.659 --> 01:19:42.664]  And to have this mindset that you're gonna go to this better place and, you know, you're really doing this for this pure reason.
[01:19:42.664 --> 01:19:44.025]  You know, I don't think...
[01:19:45.379 --> 01:19:47.581]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, this is Powerful Radio.
[01:19:47.581 --> 01:19:48.241]  Stay there.
[01:19:48.241 --> 01:19:57.029]  I want to come back with more of your combat stories and the breaking news on Michael Hastings and the IED that I believe clearly took out his car in California a few months ago.

[01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:10.457]  This capitalism?
[01:21:10.457 --> 01:21:16.624]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:22:01.018 --> 01:22:11.685]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:22:11.685 --> 01:22:16.148]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:18.890]  But we can't do that without your help.

[01:22:30.157 --> 01:22:33.640]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:39.784]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:22:39.784 --> 01:22:49.671]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:22:49.671 --> 01:22:51.172]  The war is here.
[01:22:51.172 --> 01:22:53.074]  It's an info war.
[01:22:53.074 --> 01:22:54.835]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:22:59.434 --> 01:23:04.196]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:04.196 --> 01:23:07.237]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:07.237 --> 01:23:16.201]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:16.201 --> 01:23:21.123]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:24:20.401 --> 01:24:21.843]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:24:21.843 --> 01:24:29.453]  Sergeant Joe Biggs is here to get into what happened to his friend who was embedded with him for several years off and on.
[01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:36.188]  In Afghanistan, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs is here with us.
[01:24:36.188 --> 01:24:43.194]  Briefly in this short six-minute segment, just because people need to get the perspective, I read about some people that have served five, six, seven, eight tours.
[01:24:43.194 --> 01:24:46.898]  You served three and saw a lot of incredible action.
[01:24:46.898 --> 01:24:51.101]  What is the max you've heard of somebody serving combat tours?
[01:24:51.101 --> 01:24:53.443]  Upwards of almost two years.
[01:24:53.443 --> 01:24:57.407]  I mean, yeah, that's a long time to be in the
[01:24:58.803 --> 01:25:05.571]  In the crap, in the gutter with the blood and it's, I mean, a year the Army has the longest deployments there is.
[01:25:05.571 --> 01:25:07.913]  I mean, the Marine Corps goes for a short amount of time.
[01:25:07.913 --> 01:25:10.216]  No, but I mean, how many tours total?
[01:25:10.216 --> 01:25:16.523]  Oh, I've heard of upwards of, I mean, in the Army, like I said, they're year-long deployments, so... How many year-long deployments?
[01:25:17.611 --> 01:25:17.731]  Eight?
[01:25:38.826 --> 01:25:45.009]  He's basically the entire Iraq war being at one time or another in it and all his buddies have been killed and stuff.
[01:25:45.009 --> 01:25:47.810]  It was just amazing to think about.
[01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.472]  I guess that convoy duty you've done is one of the worst things.
[01:25:50.472 --> 01:25:51.272]  Oh, it was horrible.
[01:25:51.272 --> 01:25:59.596]  I mean, because the easiest way for the insurgents in Iraq to stop, you know, the military from conducting missions was to cut off a fuel supply.
[01:25:59.596 --> 01:26:00.997]  So what we did was
[01:26:01.977 --> 01:26:08.802]  Four or five Humvees have a Humvee up front, three or four fuel tanker, a Humvee, three or four fuel tankers, so forth, so on.
[01:26:08.802 --> 01:26:15.146]  The whole convoy would spread about a mile, mile and a half long, sometimes two miles, just depending on how we kept our intervals.
[01:26:15.146 --> 01:26:17.847]  And they would just be setting up bombs, small...
[01:26:19.033 --> 01:26:24.597]  Small arms attacks, just like AK-47 fire, which would be nothing, we'd just kind of laugh and drive through it.
[01:26:24.597 --> 01:26:32.382]  But a lot of times, they'd hit that first vehicle, which was me, then it would stop the convoy, RPG attack, gunfire and all that.
[01:26:32.382 --> 01:26:39.827]  So it was, every day was one of those kind of like puckered up deals where you're like, you know, every inch of road you go across is going to be the last thing you ever see.
[01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:40.988]  Tell that IED story.
[01:26:42.352 --> 01:26:44.675]  Yeah, I was in Samara, Iraq.
[01:26:44.675 --> 01:26:52.207]  We were just leaving Tikrit and we were going south to Balad and we were approaching the Samara bypass and
[01:26:53.854 --> 01:27:06.998]  Right as we were coming over that, the hill, the sun's coming up, and you know how when you're at the airport and you see that haze over the runway, that weird look, you can see that the fuel coming up out of the pavement, and I remember seeing that, and I'm kinda, it was this haze.
[01:27:06.998 --> 01:27:07.678]  Heat devils!
[01:27:07.678 --> 01:27:11.039]  Yeah, and I was like, that looks like a boom!
[01:27:11.039 --> 01:27:14.240]  And then the vehicle just launched up in the air.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:21.782]  You know, when you see explosions on movies, you see people in crashes, they slow it down, and I always thought, as a kid, that that's just what they did for some kind of effect.
[01:27:22.725 --> 01:27:24.307]  You know, that really happens.
[01:27:24.307 --> 01:27:39.245]  I remember just being there and like seeing a piece of paper float by my face and kind of looking over and seeing my buddy, Sergeant Williams, sitting there and his head smashing against the wall and then everything just kind of speeds up and I guess your mind's trying to, you know, process what's going on.
[01:27:40.674 --> 01:28:02.181]  You know the vehicle hit the ground all the tires were blown off and the third Humvee saw my tires which was the convoy commander and after like what I just said earlier a Humvee three you know fuel tankers a Humvee that's a good distance back so I mean this that explosion had some pack to it and I was in a ASV so it has a V bottom so when I hit the ground it did this and wobbled and then went over and then flipped
[01:28:03.081 --> 01:28:10.325]  And fuel started coming out, fire, and next thing I know, actually the guy that I met last night, he was one of the guys that helped pull me out.
[01:28:10.325 --> 01:28:18.010]  All I could hear was banging on the armor, and eventually they probably opened one of the doors and started pulling us out.
[01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:24.353]  The inside of my esophagus was burnt from breathing in those explosives and all that, the fumes.
[01:28:24.353 --> 01:28:28.476]  I just had an endoscopy done, and the inside of it just looks like someone took claws and ripped it through.
[01:28:29.275 --> 01:28:30.977]  You were saying that's why you can't have white sheets.
[01:28:30.977 --> 01:28:31.978]  They bleed everywhere.
[01:28:31.978 --> 01:28:33.459]  Yeah, I also cough up blood.
[01:28:33.459 --> 01:28:34.801]  The back of my head still bleeds.
[01:28:34.801 --> 01:28:36.262]  And this was September 26, 2006.
[01:28:36.262 --> 01:28:43.409]  So... I mean, for that stuff... Is that what got your foot with the shrapnel?
[01:28:43.409 --> 01:28:44.730]  No, that was in Afghanistan.
[01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:46.372]  This was Iraq.
[01:28:46.372 --> 01:28:47.733]  What happened to your foot?
[01:28:47.733 --> 01:28:50.056]  Oh, I just caught some stuff in a firefight in my right foot.
[01:28:51.817 --> 01:28:52.437]  It's one of those things.
[01:28:52.437 --> 01:28:58.739]  I guess I make it sound like it's nothing, but I mean... I've been seeing these news articles now where some of the guys all have like half their foot blown off.
[01:28:58.739 --> 01:29:01.640]  They're putting... They got guys with prosthesis out there now, right?
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:01.960]  Fighting?
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:08.161]  I mean... I never... I mean, not a lot of... That's like old-fashioned where guys got like peg legs out there fighting.
[01:29:08.161 --> 01:29:09.722]  I mean, there's some motivated men out there.
[01:29:09.722 --> 01:29:11.542]  I mean, they don't want to give up.
[01:29:11.542 --> 01:29:12.842]  I mean, it's one of those things.
[01:29:12.842 --> 01:29:14.263]  It's your life, and it's...
[01:29:15.185 --> 01:29:16.767]  That's what you want to do.
[01:29:16.767 --> 01:29:17.968]  You've done it for so long, too.
[01:29:17.968 --> 01:29:21.512]  It's kind of hard to... Once you've been in, like me, I was in for a long time.
[01:29:21.512 --> 01:29:25.377]  Once you're in that long, it's hard to imagine not being there.
[01:29:25.377 --> 01:29:26.398]  Is it also a drug?
[01:29:28.227 --> 01:29:29.268]  It feels like it, yeah.
[01:29:29.268 --> 01:29:33.731]  It's definitely a rush that nothing else in this world will ever give you.
[01:29:33.731 --> 01:29:34.191]  Absolutely.
[01:29:34.191 --> 01:29:36.793]  You start talking about fighting, I see the hair standing up in the back of your neck.
[01:29:36.793 --> 01:29:37.053]  Yeah.
[01:29:37.053 --> 01:29:38.254]  I can see it from here, huh?
[01:29:38.254 --> 01:29:38.494]  Yeah.
[01:29:38.494 --> 01:29:40.836]  We'll be right back with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[01:29:40.836 --> 01:29:41.756]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:41.756 --> 01:29:46.760]  We're going to shift gears into his friend he was embedded with in Afghanistan, Michael Hastings.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.321]  This is important information.
[01:29:48.321 --> 01:29:50.142]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.142 --> 01:29:51.523]  We're on the march.

[01:33:24.788 --> 01:33:27.211]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:33:30.232 --> 01:33:53.522]  Alright, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs is here with us and he's told some of this already but since he's here with us in studio for radio listeners and also TV viewers watching on PrisonPlanet.TV I thought that we should walk through all of this
[01:33:55.102 --> 01:34:01.326]  Again, what led up to Michael's car blowing up, the Rolling Stone associate editor.
[01:34:01.326 --> 01:34:07.770]  And the reason I made a big deal out of this is, in the past, the media would go look and see if this was foul play.
[01:34:07.770 --> 01:34:08.911]  Just out of hand.
[01:34:08.911 --> 01:34:11.953]  Instead, day one, they said, you don't say it could be foul play.
[01:34:11.953 --> 01:34:13.014]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:16.126]  And then just more and more comes out.
[01:34:16.126 --> 01:34:17.886]  The car not speeding as fast as they said.
[01:34:17.886 --> 01:34:20.247]  The flash of light.
[01:34:20.247 --> 01:34:26.089]  Then, clearly, people going and looking at the tree, including our reporters we sent to LA.
[01:34:26.089 --> 01:34:28.990]  The tree, not even really damaged, it came to rest up against it.
[01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:33.612]  The engine, blown out the back way down the road.
[01:34:33.612 --> 01:34:35.592]  All of this stuff.
[01:34:35.592 --> 01:34:39.334]  And the fact that he sent an email saying basically,
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.761]  They're after me.
[01:34:41.761 --> 01:34:42.981]  I'm going to go into hiding.
[01:34:42.981 --> 01:34:46.023]  Get ready for the feds.
[01:34:46.023 --> 01:34:58.089]  And some of Michael Hastings other friends that have talked to Joe Biggs and of course Joe got the email where he said he was basically going into hiding and had a big story he was about to break and get ready for the feds to come.
[01:34:58.089 --> 01:35:02.451]  Everybody else was too scared to even release that email.
[01:35:03.834 --> 01:35:10.696]  And let me tell you folks, when it's not an inside job or foul play, they come out and say we're doing an investigation for a couple weeks.
[01:35:10.696 --> 01:35:13.597]  And the car blew up, we don't know what did it.
[01:35:13.597 --> 01:35:24.660]  When it's suspicious, they go, no foul play, this is completely normal, happens all the time, nobody look at this, the feds weren't talking to him, he wasn't working on a big story, there's nothing happening here, just move along.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:28.881]  When you see that type of behavior, ladies and gentlemen, that's when the red flags go up.
[01:35:30.325 --> 01:35:32.048]  And I've seen them kill a lot of journalists.
[01:35:32.048 --> 01:35:33.291]  Gary Webb, you name it.
[01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:35.875]  The Arkansas-ing of people.
[01:35:35.875 --> 01:35:37.338]  This is a really serious issue.
[01:35:37.338 --> 01:35:39.221]  And persecution of press all over the world.
[01:35:40.566 --> 01:35:41.327]  Is a big deal.
[01:35:41.327 --> 01:35:52.154]  So, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, good friends with Michael Hastings, they kept in contact with each other in the years after they've been in combat together, said, I'm going to stand up for my friend.
[01:35:52.154 --> 01:35:58.099]  He went to the memorial on the East Coast, was there, she came up to him.
[01:35:58.099 --> 01:36:02.362]  I mean, he really told the story in detail yesterday and specifically told him, I'm going to bring down whoever did this.
[01:36:02.995 --> 01:36:12.164]  And then to see her up there all glowing, oh nothing happened, move along, I mean folks, this is really getting serious.
[01:36:12.164 --> 01:36:25.997]  And if they can kill Michael Hastings and nobody investigates it, then they can kill Alex Jones, they can kill Ron Paul, they can kill Matt Drudge, they can kill Breitbart, oh I guess he's dead, they can kill whoever they want.
[01:36:27.356 --> 01:36:41.512]  And at a certain point, if more people start dying, I don't know what we're supposed to do, because, you know, I'm not looking to start a fight here, but, and I know it's a big shadowy government and things, but, you know, at a certain point, we just can't sit here while death squads run around killing whoever they want.
[01:36:42.727 --> 01:36:57.377]  Now, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, you heard me just lay out some of the basics of what happened, but getting back into it, talking about remembering Michael Hastings, and just repeating what you said about him in combat compared to all the other press you ever saw, and then how scared he was.
[01:36:57.377 --> 01:37:11.546]  In your own words, repeat what you said last night to the cameras, on record here, live on air, for our own safety, because I want to get everything out you said last night here, live on air, because I don't want to sit on this tape while we're putting it in the film, and then, you know, we both end up having our own little explosions.
[01:37:13.063 --> 01:37:25.348]  Well, like I've said before, 2008, I find out that we're going to get another reporter in bed with us and, you know, like me and the rest of the guys, we're kind of like rolling our eyes, like, oh, great, here we go again.
[01:37:25.348 --> 01:37:34.251]  Another, you know, reporter coming out here saying that they're going to be all hard and hard charging and they're, you know, dedicated to working on their stories and doing all this.
[01:37:37.435 --> 01:37:44.997]  You know, when he gets there, it was just a whole different persona of what I just had, you know, in my head from all the other guys.
[01:37:44.997 --> 01:37:47.858]  He jumps in there and he's just like, you know, what are you guys doing?
[01:37:47.858 --> 01:37:49.118]  What are you working on?
[01:37:49.118 --> 01:37:50.079]  You know, how could I help?
[01:37:50.079 --> 01:37:53.320]  You know, what's the best way to portray what's going on?
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:53.560]  You know?
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:38:09.273]  So we get out there and we finally get on he goes he goes on a few missions with us and he actually was involved in a pretty big one up on a mountain top in Pakistan and we came under attack and you know like I said before with other reporters they would just whimper down and
[01:38:09.793 --> 01:38:11.914]  They would, you know, you know, like, why did I do this?
[01:38:11.914 --> 01:38:12.895]  I want to go back home.
[01:38:12.895 --> 01:38:23.161]  I didn't sign up for this, you know, and Michael's just sitting there with his grin on his face and I'm looking over at him and I just remember kind of sitting there shooting my M4 and I'm looking over and he's just looking up at me smiling with a camera and he's like, is this it?
[01:38:23.161 --> 01:38:23.681]  Is there more?
[01:38:23.681 --> 01:38:26.023]  You know, he just had that intensity, that passion about what he did.
[01:38:26.283 --> 01:38:29.985]  And you described there's A-10s, helicopters, mortars going off around you.
[01:38:29.985 --> 01:38:31.785]  Oh yeah, there were A-10 warthogs coming in.
[01:38:31.785 --> 01:38:33.846]  We had helicopters shooting Hellfire missiles.
[01:38:33.846 --> 01:38:37.188]  It was just complete and total chaos.
[01:38:37.188 --> 01:38:38.668]  Controlled chaos, I guess you could call it.
[01:38:38.668 --> 01:38:40.309]  It was like a scene out of Apocalypse Now.
[01:38:40.309 --> 01:38:40.509]  Yeah.
[01:38:40.509 --> 01:38:42.610]  It was one of those things that you kind of...
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:48.944]  You want to see when you get in the military, but then it happens and you're like, wow, this is not like the movies.
[01:38:48.944 --> 01:38:50.024]  This is so intense.
[01:38:50.024 --> 01:39:00.172]  Like there's so many parts moving, you know, you know, the guys on the ground calling in for the airstrikes, the artillery, the, you know, all this stuff trying to get clearance from Washington.
[01:39:00.172 --> 01:39:03.494]  Can we use a C-130 Spectre gunship?
[01:39:03.494 --> 01:39:04.555]  You know, can we do this?
[01:39:04.555 --> 01:39:06.596]  And like, no, you know, it's not important enough.
[01:39:06.596 --> 01:39:06.857]  Okay.
[01:39:07.728 --> 01:39:09.630]  Well, there's like 300 of them and 30 of us.
[01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:13.394]  I think that's pretty important, but the A-10s took care of it for us.
[01:39:13.394 --> 01:39:15.356]  But, you know, Michael was just that guy.
[01:39:15.356 --> 01:39:17.218]  He didn't shriek back from the fear.
[01:39:17.218 --> 01:39:17.719]  He loved it.
[01:39:17.719 --> 01:39:22.644]  I mean, he was just a go-getter and a gentleman junkie and definitely right up my alley, my kind of guy.
[01:39:26.056 --> 01:39:27.778]  I think there was more to this guy than meets the eye.
[01:39:27.778 --> 01:39:35.904]  I mean, he marries the head spokesperson, the PR flack, the PSYOPS officer of the National Security Council.
[01:39:35.904 --> 01:39:37.906]  That's the top of the pyramid.
[01:39:37.906 --> 01:39:39.147]  Worldwide.
[01:39:39.147 --> 01:39:46.673]  Because you've got globalist interest and banksters that own things, but the United States National Security Council is telling NATO what to do.
[01:39:46.673 --> 01:39:48.415]  It's telling the UN what to do.
[01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:49.616]  It's making all the decisions.
[01:39:49.616 --> 01:39:51.437]  I mean, that's the top of the pyramid.
[01:39:51.437 --> 01:39:53.459]  The eye of Sauron, that's right in the middle of it.
[01:39:53.459 --> 01:39:54.100]  He marries her.
[01:39:55.185 --> 01:39:55.966]  Two years ago.
[01:39:55.966 --> 01:39:58.248]  Yeah.
[01:39:58.248 --> 01:40:00.350]  Love, I guess.
[01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:02.612]  Love will do crazy things to you.
[01:40:02.612 --> 01:40:09.818]  It's definitely not one of those, you know, a matchup you would think, but you know, whatever.
[01:40:09.818 --> 01:40:11.099]  Amazing.
[01:40:11.099 --> 01:40:18.426]  I mean, repeat what you said yesterday about leading up to this, talking to her, and then when you're in that restaurant, your buddy goes, look up, she's on CNN.
[01:40:18.426 --> 01:40:20.368]  I mean, just your whole take on that.
[01:40:20.967 --> 01:40:37.954]  Yeah, you know, from the get-go of how he was in Afghanistan, courageous, you know, brave, strong kind of guy, you know, all he did was speak the truth and he didn't let anybody hinder, you know, that he didn't let anybody kind of like persuade him to change his stories, his words.
[01:40:37.954 --> 01:40:41.215]  He spoke the truth and that's just how he was.
[01:40:41.215 --> 01:40:42.996]  So I get the, you know, I get this email
[01:40:44.682 --> 01:40:46.725]  And that email, you know, you sound so scared.
[01:40:46.725 --> 01:40:51.372]  And it just didn't sound like the Michael that, you know, myself or anyone else knew.
[01:40:51.372 --> 01:40:53.916]  You said you talked to his other friends who physically talked to him.
[01:40:53.916 --> 01:40:55.358]  He was looking... I'm gonna repeat all that.
[01:40:55.358 --> 01:40:57.321]  The feds had come to the house, looking under the car.
[01:40:57.321 --> 01:40:58.563]  You said he was scared.
[01:40:58.563 --> 01:40:59.404]  Yeah, he had, uh...
[01:41:00.786 --> 01:41:10.093]  LAPD and some other people had come by the house, like I said, at that point there was a lot of weird things happening in the days leading up.
[01:41:10.093 --> 01:41:12.095]  He was seen looking under his car with his brother.
[01:41:12.095 --> 01:41:21.222]  His other buddy, a mutual friend of Mike and I's, said that five days out he started speaking in code.
[01:41:21.222 --> 01:41:24.665]  He was just panicked and on alert.
[01:41:25.345 --> 01:41:29.089]  You know, just seemed like he was constantly looking over his shoulders left and right.
[01:41:29.089 --> 01:41:33.212]  And I knew he was like that in a sense because what happened with the McChrystal story.
[01:41:33.212 --> 01:41:37.697]  You know, he called me a few times and I spoke to him and he's like, you know, I'm kind of scared.
[01:41:37.697 --> 01:41:39.839]  Well, you told me people were telling him we're going to kill you.
[01:41:39.839 --> 01:41:40.079]  Yeah.
[01:41:40.079 --> 01:41:42.001]  I mean, he even wrote that in one of his books.
[01:41:42.001 --> 01:41:44.283]  I mean, he pretty much came out and said that they said that.
[01:41:44.283 --> 01:41:49.207]  So, I mean, he definitely... The biggest killers in the world say we're going to kill you.
[01:41:49.207 --> 01:41:50.809]  Your car blows up and it's not suspicious.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.465]  I mean, everyone just wants to crack up to be some accident.
[01:41:54.465 --> 01:41:59.556]  I guess it's easier to sweep this away and sweep it under the rug than actually dig in there and ask the questions.
[01:41:59.556 --> 01:42:02.482]  And a lot of people out there just don't want to get into it.
[01:42:03.575 --> 01:42:10.700]  But, you know, it's not going to stop me and some other people I know that are still curious and still have all these unanswered questions and we want to find out what's going on.
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:12.421]  But like you said, Mike would do it for you.
[01:42:12.421 --> 01:42:14.222]  Well, of course, Mike would do it for anybody.
[01:42:14.222 --> 01:42:15.963]  I mean, that was just the kind of guy he did.
[01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:21.907]  Anything, any kind of, you know, unjust act that happened and he didn't feel right about it, he'd get that gut feeling.
[01:42:21.907 --> 01:42:23.368]  I mean, he's going to look into it.
[01:42:23.368 --> 01:42:25.609]  I mean, he was going to find out what was going to happen.
[01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:26.630]  I can't just not...
[01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:29.372]  You know, I didn't choose for the email to come to me.
[01:42:29.372 --> 01:42:35.997]  I, you know, I would have saw that and been like, you know, what's going on and definitely still been curious about the whole thing.
[01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:42.113]  But it came to me, and I didn't ask for it to happen, but I got this feeling I had to do something.
[01:42:42.113 --> 01:42:53.141]  But before I even released the email, I started contacting the other people that were on there, and I'm asking them, hey, don't you think this is weird that we got this email and now he's dead?
[01:42:53.141 --> 01:42:56.243]  Are you guys at BuzzFeed gonna do anything about this?
[01:42:56.243 --> 01:42:58.845]  And then the response I got was, you know about this?
[01:42:58.845 --> 01:43:02.067]  And then that was it.
[01:43:02.067 --> 01:43:03.568]  And I kept emailing them back, so what are we gonna do?
[01:43:05.609 --> 01:43:06.869]  Nothing.
[01:43:06.869 --> 01:43:09.971]  So I started asking around, you know, I asked my mom for some advice.
[01:43:09.971 --> 01:43:12.812]  I was like, you know, should I should I say something?
[01:43:12.812 --> 01:43:14.792]  And my mom's like, don't say anything.
[01:43:14.792 --> 01:43:16.693]  She's like, that's some scary stuff.
[01:43:16.693 --> 01:43:21.314]  I thought about it for a while and I was just kind of like, you know, my gut tells me I've got to say something.
[01:43:21.314 --> 01:43:22.535]  So I started contacting.
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:28.102]  Different people and, you know, KTLA was the one who responded.
[01:43:28.102 --> 01:43:33.205]  So I forwarded him that email and now, you know, most people aren't thinking this is an accident anymore.
[01:43:33.205 --> 01:43:35.366]  They're kind of getting that feeling that I had from the get-go.
[01:43:35.366 --> 01:43:35.746]  That's right.
[01:43:35.746 --> 01:43:41.789]  You brought the fact that he was going into hiding, that the feds were coming after him.
[01:43:41.789 --> 01:43:43.109]  They didn't want that in the equation.
[01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:44.670]  They want everybody to be scared.
[01:43:44.670 --> 01:43:47.792]  But one guy stood up and now more and more is coming out.
[01:43:47.792 --> 01:43:51.874]  Get into... I mean, repeat what you said.
[01:43:53.570 --> 01:44:02.994]  Yesterday we were taping in there for the film about what she told you at the funeral then versus what you saw on CNN and what you think might be going on there.
[01:44:02.994 --> 01:44:21.802]  Yeah, I went up to Vermont with a mutual friend of Mike and I's and stayed with them and we went to the memorial service and we get there and I kind of do a walkthrough, you know, shake his father's hand, his mother's, brothers and sit down and it's just kind of one of those
[01:44:23.374 --> 01:44:28.455]  Sad, you know, it was just, it was, it was nice to see that many people who cared about him show up.
[01:44:28.455 --> 01:44:31.036]  But it was just kind of a sad, just overall.
[01:44:31.036 --> 01:44:31.736]  Solemn.
[01:44:31.736 --> 01:44:32.616]  Yeah.
[01:44:32.616 --> 01:44:35.677]  So I walked, I was like, you know, I got to get out of here for a second and get, get a water.
[01:44:35.677 --> 01:44:41.138]  So I'm walking out and as I walk around, Elyse came around, Michael's wife, and said, Staff Sergeant Biggs.
[01:44:41.138 --> 01:44:43.538]  And I turned around and she goes, come here.
[01:44:43.538 --> 01:44:45.959]  And I'm sitting here thinking, all right, this could go one of two ways.
[01:44:45.959 --> 01:44:51.080]  This could be like, thanks for, you know, bringing this to light or, you know, this isn't into your business.
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:51.900]  Why did you release this?
[01:44:53.041 --> 01:44:54.741]  I mean really it could have gone either way.
[01:44:54.741 --> 01:44:55.802]  Well he sent you the email.
[01:44:55.802 --> 01:44:56.742]  Yeah.
[01:44:56.742 --> 01:44:59.903]  So she actually comes up to me and she's crying and she hugs me and says thank you.
[01:44:59.903 --> 01:45:06.024]  She starts talking to me about how Mike had spoken about me many times and I mean she knew more about me than I knew about her.
[01:45:06.024 --> 01:45:12.286]  I mean she was just going from story to story from Afghanistan and the conversations we would have and she knew everything about me.
[01:45:13.188 --> 01:45:31.816]  You know and I was kind of put me more to calm and then you know after she wiped the tears away you know she got that that pitbull look and she she told me you know we're gonna find out she's like I'm gonna find out who did this and I'm you know I'm not gonna like roll over on this this isn't an accident I will find out who did this and that was pretty powerful for me.
[01:45:31.816 --> 01:45:33.436]  She said this wasn't an accident?
[01:45:33.436 --> 01:45:34.797]  Yeah.
[01:45:34.797 --> 01:45:37.278]  And and then fast forward a month later you
[01:45:38.174 --> 01:45:42.717]  Yeah, well, then I tell her that I'm going to go to LA and do some investigating.
[01:45:42.717 --> 01:45:45.138]  I want to look around and find out what's going on.
[01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:49.501]  You know, I had a whole checklist of things I wanted to, you know, cover and go over.
[01:45:49.501 --> 01:45:51.362]  And we have some potential suspects.
[01:45:51.362 --> 01:45:52.743]  Yeah.
[01:45:52.743 --> 01:45:53.624]  So.
[01:45:53.624 --> 01:45:55.745]  I think she was threatened, but keep going.
[01:45:55.745 --> 01:45:56.706]  So I send her that.
[01:45:56.706 --> 01:45:58.587]  And at first she's like, OK, that's fine.
[01:45:58.587 --> 01:46:01.189]  You know, she just seemed all, you know, dandy about it.
[01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:03.030]  It seemed like, yeah, whatever, you know, go do it.
[01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.890]  You know, that's your friend.
[01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:04.931]  You can find out whatever you want.
[01:46:05.563 --> 01:46:10.908]  You know, I'm going to do what I'm doing and investigate on my side and you do what you want to do.
[01:46:10.908 --> 01:46:17.354]  And then the next day, I just, I wake up and I'm like, I took a nap and I had like four or five long texts.
[01:46:17.354 --> 01:46:18.776]  That was right after you've been on my show.
[01:46:18.776 --> 01:46:19.376]  Yeah.
[01:46:19.376 --> 01:46:20.638]  Four or five long texts.
[01:46:20.638 --> 01:46:22.219]  And you know, like, don't go to LA.
[01:46:22.219 --> 01:46:22.820]  Don't do it.
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.320]  Don't do it.
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:23.981]  Please don't go.
[01:46:26.610 --> 01:46:27.831]  And I texted back, I was like, why?
[01:46:27.831 --> 01:46:29.772]  And she was like, just don't do it.
[01:46:29.772 --> 01:46:31.093]  I don't, you know, I don't want to get into it.
[01:46:31.093 --> 01:46:31.853]  Just don't do it.
[01:46:31.853 --> 01:46:34.715]  And then I called because I was like, you know, my heart started pounding.
[01:46:34.715 --> 01:46:37.136]  I'm like, all right, why the big change?
[01:46:37.136 --> 01:46:39.897]  And, uh, when I called, she didn't even answer.
[01:46:39.897 --> 01:46:40.598]  Someone else did.
[01:46:40.598 --> 01:46:45.461]  This lady saying that it was her friend, you know, and I could kind of hear her off in the background.
[01:46:45.461 --> 01:46:48.022]  And they were just like, you know, at least doesn't want you to go right now.
[01:46:48.022 --> 01:46:49.043]  Please don't do it.
[01:46:49.043 --> 01:46:50.944]  Cancel the whole trip.
[01:46:53.351 --> 01:47:07.256]  So I mean, you know, you hear a widow, you know, like that, and then the... So you called me, I was in two reporters with you at least, and a former NSA guy who investigates these things, and you said, uh, let's wait two weeks.
[01:47:07.256 --> 01:47:08.057]  So we wait two weeks.
[01:47:08.977 --> 01:47:10.538]  And I didn't even know she was going to be on.
[01:47:10.538 --> 01:47:11.679]  I text you at about 9 at night.
[01:47:11.679 --> 01:47:12.960]  I was putting my kids to bed.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:15.882]  I text you and go, hey, how are you and her doing?
[01:47:15.882 --> 01:47:16.422]  You heard anything new?
[01:47:16.422 --> 01:47:17.643]  And you go, what are you talking about?
[01:47:17.643 --> 01:47:19.584]  She's on TV right now.
[01:47:19.584 --> 01:47:20.545]  So let's fast forward.
[01:47:20.545 --> 01:47:23.006]  Where are you right then when I'm texting you?
[01:47:23.006 --> 01:47:26.129]  I was actually having dinner with a buddy of mine, Spencer.
[01:47:26.129 --> 01:47:31.192]  And, you know, we were just actually kind of going over some stuff I was talking about.
[01:47:31.192 --> 01:47:34.834]  He was asking me, you know, what are some new leads in the story?
[01:47:34.834 --> 01:47:36.756]  You know, have I made any progress?
[01:47:36.756 --> 01:47:38.337]  And next thing you know, he kind of nudges me.
[01:47:39.502 --> 01:47:39.863]  I don't know.
[01:47:54.952 --> 01:47:55.733]  Seems happy.
[01:47:55.733 --> 01:47:59.575]  She's saying this is an accident and my stomach hurt.
[01:47:59.575 --> 01:48:01.697]  I mean, I pretty much paid the bill, got up and left.
[01:48:01.697 --> 01:48:09.282]  I just couldn't even stomach to be there and not even until the next morning that I actually, after sleeping on it, did I even watch the video on YouTube.
[01:48:09.282 --> 01:48:17.248]  It was definitely a 180 change from how she was to this whole other.
[01:48:17.248 --> 01:48:18.989]  Well, I think clearly she was threatened.
[01:48:20.034 --> 01:48:24.215]  I mean, that's the prime approximation.
[01:48:24.215 --> 01:48:28.017]  Or like you said, maybe she wants them to think she's not investigating or something.
[01:48:28.017 --> 01:48:34.279]  But undoubtedly, a major reporter goes into hiding and is dead 24 hours later in a suspicious death with a car blowing up.
[01:48:34.279 --> 01:48:34.719]  I mean, this is...
[01:48:35.691 --> 01:48:41.935]  And now the police tapes have been released with witnesses saying I was driving down the road, it blows up, and then goes off the road into a tree.
[01:48:41.935 --> 01:48:43.776]  That's what all the other witnesses said.
[01:48:43.776 --> 01:48:45.637]  So it just keeps piling on.
[01:48:45.637 --> 01:48:47.878]  I want this to be a regular crash.
[01:48:47.878 --> 01:48:50.700]  I don't like knowing they can come do this to me at any moment.
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:53.982]  I mean, it's not like I want this to be a government murder.
[01:48:53.982 --> 01:48:57.224]  What are your sources saying he was working on?
[01:48:57.224 --> 01:48:59.986]  Well, as we all know, like I said from the get-go, it was the CIA.
[01:49:01.058 --> 01:49:02.059]  More.
[01:49:02.059 --> 01:49:02.819]  Now that's coming out.
[01:49:02.819 --> 01:49:03.319]  Yeah.
[01:49:03.319 --> 01:49:15.505]  So people are starting to, you know, come out and say that the other things as well were he was in direct contact with Barrett Brown, who was arrested in, what was that, 2011 in Dallas, 2012, somewhere right there.
[01:49:15.505 --> 01:49:18.427]  Because I know he's been in jail for about a year now.
[01:49:18.427 --> 01:49:19.807]  Michael was talking to him.
[01:49:19.807 --> 01:49:20.768]  That was the CIA guy.
[01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:30.414]  He was the guy that was working on Project PM who was doing a lot of computer hacking into the government that they were looking, they were doing mass spying on Americans.
[01:49:30.414 --> 01:49:35.596]  And he kind of uncovered a lot of that and then they raided, the FBI raided his house and put him in jail.
[01:49:35.596 --> 01:49:39.377]  But he was also talking to a former CIA guy who was in North Africa who they put in prison.
[01:49:39.377 --> 01:49:40.638]  He was talking to a lot of people, yeah.
[01:49:40.638 --> 01:49:50.362]  Yeah, I mean he had a lot of things going on but that Barrett Brown thing was a definitely key thing because he even got a copy of the warrant that had all the arresting people involved
[01:49:51.477 --> 01:50:01.751]  on there, so I mean that in itself, the McChrystal thing, this, looking into the CIA, all these things add up to, you know, there's a lot of people pissed off at him.
[01:50:01.751 --> 01:50:06.377]  Well, they killed Aaron Schwartz too, undoubtedly, who was really giving him trouble.
[01:50:06.377 --> 01:50:08.500]  We're going to come back from break and I want to talk about
[01:50:11.386 --> 01:50:12.526]  That's why he changed.
[01:50:12.526 --> 01:50:13.827]  You talked about this yesterday.
[01:50:13.827 --> 01:50:15.547]  You know, usually he was a lot nicer on TV.
[01:50:15.547 --> 01:50:18.308]  He wasn't as... And the weeks before, he's like, we gotta get them!
[01:50:18.308 --> 01:50:19.529]  The government's evil!
[01:50:19.529 --> 01:50:20.369]  We gotta get together!
[01:50:20.369 --> 01:50:20.889]  They're bad!
[01:50:20.889 --> 01:50:22.290]  They're coming after us!
[01:50:22.290 --> 01:50:24.010]  And he was like, I'm gonna break something big!
[01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:25.731]  I mean, what was it?
[01:50:25.731 --> 01:50:26.791]  Think about this.
[01:50:26.791 --> 01:50:30.373]  What was it he'd learned that wasn't just, oh, they're spying on us or something?
[01:50:30.373 --> 01:50:32.053]  What had freaked him out?
[01:50:32.053 --> 01:50:32.773]  I think it was 9-11.
[01:50:32.773 --> 01:50:37.135]  I mean, my gut tells me he broke into the big stuff.
[01:50:38.363 --> 01:50:44.769]  And, uh, that's the big... I mean, I interviewed Barry Jennings, who was the deputy head of New York Emergency Management, on this show.
[01:50:44.769 --> 01:50:46.511]  And he said, no, they blew up Building 7.
[01:50:46.511 --> 01:50:47.952]  They had bombs in there, they told me.
[01:50:47.952 --> 01:50:49.053]  He was dead two weeks later.
[01:50:49.053 --> 01:50:51.435]  I mean, he just dropped dead.
[01:50:52.375 --> 01:50:53.736]  And the family moved out a week later.
[01:50:53.736 --> 01:50:55.137]  It was like some witness protection deal.
[01:50:55.137 --> 01:50:58.919]  In fact, some say that he probably staged his death and put him under national security.
[01:50:58.919 --> 01:50:59.399]  We'll be right.
[01:50:59.399 --> 01:51:01.080]  I mean, I interview a lot of people end up dead.
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:02.481]  You know about RVs.
[01:51:02.481 --> 01:51:03.942]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:51:03.942 --> 01:51:06.684]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:51:06.684 --> 01:51:09.446]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[01:52:03.198 --> 01:52:11.250]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:52:11.250 --> 01:52:11.951]  Hundreds of you have
[01:52:13.443 --> 01:52:16.165]  50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:52:16.165 --> 01:52:18.346]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:52:18.346 --> 01:52:24.751]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.

[01:54:11.698 --> 01:54:25.767]  Alright folks, we're going a little bit in the next hour with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and then in studio, we're going to have one of my favorite filmmakers, Dan Dix, who's down here working with us on Obama Deception 2 with one of his other members of Press for Truth.
[01:54:25.767 --> 01:54:36.073]  So I look forward to getting some updates from him just on trying to shoot B-roll around the country and the type of harassment he got from the police and people in this supposedly free nation.
[01:54:36.073 --> 01:54:38.054]  So that's coming up.
[01:54:38.054 --> 01:54:39.055]  Joe Biggs here with us.
[01:54:40.882 --> 01:54:49.069]  Good friends with the now deceased really patriot for the First Amendment, Michael Hastings.
[01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:59.698]  Talk about, I mean repeat what you said yesterday in your own words about the change you saw in him in the weeks leading up to his death and now you said you've gone back and reviewed the videos.
[01:54:59.698 --> 01:55:02.701]  I mean there was real, real concern there.
[01:55:02.701 --> 01:55:08.406]  Yeah, you know, when this all happened I was very suspicious of everything so I kind of sat down and I was like,
[01:55:09.591 --> 01:55:10.893]  I need to go over a checklist.
[01:55:10.893 --> 01:55:20.707]  I need to create how he was, what things are happening now, you know, what I know, and then try to start trying to put the pieces together, see if any of this leads up to anything at the time.
[01:55:20.707 --> 01:55:22.229]  You know, this is just, you know, the days after.
[01:55:23.066 --> 01:55:32.316]  So I got on YouTube and I was like, you know, I think I'm gonna start looking at a lot of his recent or, you know, interviews from sort of about a year back.
[01:55:32.316 --> 01:55:38.742]  And then I want to start seeing them up until I watch his last one that was on the Young Turks, I believe.
[01:55:38.742 --> 01:55:39.744]  And we got to do something.
[01:55:39.744 --> 01:55:40.604]  They're coming for us.
[01:55:40.604 --> 01:55:40.885]  Yeah.
[01:55:40.885 --> 01:55:45.690]  You know, you know, the first interviews I'm watching, you know, he's, you know, he's very calm and, you know,
[01:55:47.366 --> 01:55:48.487]  You know, Obama's great.
[01:55:48.487 --> 01:55:50.089]  We're doing all this good stuff, you know.
[01:55:50.089 --> 01:55:51.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:57.215]  And then, you know, towards the end, it's like, you know, they're trying to keep us from, you know, saying what we want to say.
[01:55:57.215 --> 01:56:00.258]  They're going to come after us, you know, if we speak the truth.
[01:56:01.052 --> 01:56:17.860]  You know, his whole persona just shifted and he went from, you know, being this calm person to, like you said, apparently finding something out in that time frame leading up to his death to where he just felt like, you know, the press was under attack and he needed to be a hard charger.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:23.523]  He needed to, you know, stand up and people needed to see that, you know, it's affecting everyone out there.
[01:56:23.643 --> 01:56:26.406]  That's a normal response to tyrannies, to act like that.
[01:56:26.406 --> 01:56:31.032]  People go, oh, it's so strange, that's how you're supposed to act, when your country's being overrun by crooks.
[01:56:31.032 --> 01:56:33.155]  What does your gut tell you he was discovering?
[01:56:33.155 --> 01:56:37.741]  I mean, we know it was CIA, it was government hacking, it was... But I mean, is that enough to make him act like that?
[01:56:39.758 --> 01:56:43.481]  I mean, he was working on many stories, multiple stories, as we've said.
[01:56:43.481 --> 01:56:44.682]  I mean, any of that all together.
[01:56:44.682 --> 01:56:57.873]  I mean, the stuff with Project PM is a big thing for me because all that hacking stuff that Barrett Brown was involved in was, you know, bringing to light that the government was mass spying on, you know, reporters and all these people.
[01:56:57.873 --> 01:57:00.875]  So I think that probably is it because he was like, they're persecuting the press.
[01:57:00.875 --> 01:57:02.216]  They're coming after us.
[01:57:02.216 --> 01:57:03.617]  We've got to stand up against them.
[01:57:03.617 --> 01:57:04.238]  Yeah.
[01:57:04.238 --> 01:57:07.460]  And so I think that probably was it from what he said on that last interview.
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:08.401]  I mean, that's all it could be.
[01:57:09.730 --> 01:57:27.598]  I mean to have that kind of job to have that his name's out there he's a big person you know as far as you know worldwide known you know so to be to see that kind of stuff to see that our government's gonna try to you know hush-hush everyone that definitely you know is gonna upset you and I mean that's definitely what happened
[01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:30.811]  We're going to go to break and come back and have five more minutes.
[01:57:30.811 --> 01:57:32.152]  It's been great having you here in town.
[01:57:32.152 --> 01:57:38.697]  We'll finish up discussing that, but I'm not calling the Young Turks out because that's not what I do.
[01:57:38.697 --> 01:57:43.240]  I'll call people out for what they say that's wrong, but they said they were such good buddies with him.
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:44.682]  They've gone with the official story.
[01:57:45.402 --> 01:57:49.905]  Like, all these so-called liberals that were friends with this guy have just gone with the official story.
[01:57:49.905 --> 01:57:52.266]  And that's some great friends they have there, let me tell you.
[01:57:52.266 --> 01:58:00.911]  Some of those guys that work there, though, even reached out to me, and they're the ones that helped me confirm that Mike had had the cops come there, you know, that people had visited him.
[01:58:00.911 --> 01:58:02.012]  Okay, well then maybe I missed it.
[01:58:02.012 --> 01:58:02.993]  Have they done shows on that?
[01:58:02.993 --> 01:58:03.533]  No, no, no.
[01:58:03.533 --> 01:58:04.454]  They haven't said anything.
[01:58:04.454 --> 01:58:08.216]  They've just told me in emails, you know, that's what they have said.
[01:58:08.216 --> 01:58:09.297]  That's even worse.
[01:58:09.297 --> 01:58:10.037]  Yeah.
[01:58:10.037 --> 01:58:14.700]  So they're out there in LA, they know about all this, and then they're not doing anything about it.
[01:58:16.075 --> 01:58:19.336]  See, that shows they're not just dumb liberals.
[01:58:19.336 --> 01:58:20.577]  They're scared.
[01:58:20.577 --> 01:58:24.099]  And if everybody gets scared of the tyrants, they're going to take over.
[01:58:24.099 --> 01:58:25.159]  Don't people get that?
[01:58:25.159 --> 01:58:29.141]  That only free people that have courage will be free?
[01:58:29.141 --> 01:58:32.502]  If you're scared of tyrants, they'll take over.
[01:58:32.502 --> 01:58:33.062]  Unbelievable.
[01:58:33.062 --> 01:58:35.383]  That just blew me away.
[01:58:35.383 --> 01:58:35.704]  Wow.
[01:58:35.704 --> 01:58:41.486]  We'll be right back with a final segment with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.

[02:00:13.532 --> 02:00:17.714]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.714 --> 02:00:21.776]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:29.623]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm really glad we got this man to town, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[02:00:29.623 --> 02:00:47.069]  The only person out of all these military people that knew Michael Hastings, the young Turks that confirmed to him that, oh no, his brother was there, they were checking out his car, the police had been to his house, feds, they just called him feds, and then his car blows up and he dies, and I'm not trying to start a fight with the young Turks.
[02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:50.751]  It just is really lonely, and what's scary is all the cowardice.
[02:00:51.690 --> 02:00:55.412]  What's scary is that he was friends, reportedly, and hung out with those people.
[02:00:55.412 --> 02:01:01.855]  Listen, if somebody kills me, man, my friends better, well, come out and call for an investigation.
[02:01:01.855 --> 02:01:02.555]  Bare minimum.
[02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:04.296]  I mean, it's just so dishonorable.
[02:01:07.245 --> 02:01:08.686]  I should, I guess, debrief you better.
[02:01:08.686 --> 02:01:09.906]  I'm not a cop or an interrogator.
[02:01:09.906 --> 02:01:11.967]  That's why I don't know how to get all the info out of you.
[02:01:11.967 --> 02:01:13.668]  You're like, oh no, I talked to the Young Turks too.
[02:01:13.668 --> 02:01:15.409]  They, you know, they're people, they're producers.
[02:01:15.409 --> 02:01:15.729]  They know.
[02:01:15.729 --> 02:01:17.310]  They're the ones that gave me this, this and that.
[02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:19.731]  They're out there with the whole investigation team.
[02:01:19.731 --> 02:01:23.172]  And then they were telling you, oh yeah, no, this is real fishy.
[02:01:23.172 --> 02:01:27.154]  Comments on that or comments on other tidbits people have told you?
[02:01:27.154 --> 02:01:32.676]  Um, that was just the one thing that kind of helped me, like,
[02:01:34.209 --> 02:01:36.250]  Get my investigation going in a certain direction.
[02:01:36.250 --> 02:01:42.452]  You know, when I heard that from them, that was definitely some helpful things for me to get on the right track, I would say.
[02:01:42.452 --> 02:01:47.973]  And like I said, I don't know what they put out to the public as far as what they think happened.
[02:01:47.973 --> 02:01:51.274]  Yeah, to be fair, I don't follow all of it, but I probably would have heard about it.
[02:01:51.274 --> 02:01:52.675]  I've seen them about him.
[02:01:52.675 --> 02:01:53.715]  They just go, it's too bad.
[02:01:53.715 --> 02:01:54.395]  What a great guy.
[02:01:54.395 --> 02:01:54.855]  He's gone.
[02:01:54.855 --> 02:01:56.696]  I mean, I watched their memorial thing.
[02:01:56.696 --> 02:02:02.178]  They did a nice memorial piece on him and a video of all the interviews they've had and it was really good.
[02:02:02.178 --> 02:02:03.318]  And I mean, from the way that
[02:02:04.511 --> 02:02:06.512]  Michael kind of showed passion on that show.
[02:02:06.512 --> 02:02:08.892]  It seemed like he did feel safe there with him.
[02:02:08.892 --> 02:02:14.354]  I mean... Well, my issue is, is I could say, oh, look at those fools having no idea what world they live in.
[02:02:14.354 --> 02:02:17.075]  But if the producers are like, oh yeah, we know about the feds and all this.
[02:02:17.075 --> 02:02:19.595]  Well, all the feds are on the news going, we didn't visit him.
[02:02:19.595 --> 02:02:21.696]  But his email says that that's happening.
[02:02:21.696 --> 02:02:23.777]  It's just like, it becomes complicit.
[02:02:23.777 --> 02:02:26.317]  When you know stuff's going on, you don't say anything.
[02:02:26.317 --> 02:02:31.679]  I was always curious as to why the FBI released a statement saying they weren't investigating him, and that happened before I even released the email.
[02:02:32.984 --> 02:02:34.524]  So how did they even know that?
[02:02:34.524 --> 02:02:41.506]  Well, like you said, when you were out in the Army stationed in El Paso, at what, Camp Biggs?
[02:02:41.506 --> 02:02:42.507]  That's funny, same name as you.
[02:02:42.507 --> 02:02:43.607]  Camp Biggs Army Aerofield.
[02:02:43.607 --> 02:02:46.228]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:46.228 --> 02:02:47.708]  They said it's the safest city in the country.
[02:02:47.708 --> 02:02:48.768]  Tell folks what they say.
[02:02:48.768 --> 02:02:51.989]  There's no crime here, but in the parking lot there was shootings.
[02:02:51.989 --> 02:03:00.732]  You know, there was, you get there and you have your incoming briefing of how El Paso is, and they tell you that, you know, exactly, it's one of the safest cities in the U.S.
[02:03:01.852 --> 02:03:13.636]  Don't believe all that stuff you see on the news and then you know I'm out here in the streets of UTEP, University of Texas El Paso and there's drive-bys that happen and I mean it's not an everyday occurrence but I mean... You said heads on the ground though.
[02:03:13.636 --> 02:03:16.256]  I mean they dig up hundreds of bodies it's unbelievable.
[02:03:16.256 --> 02:03:24.099]  Yeah there was always gang violence and stuff like that you know you'd hear about it the news and or they would find bodies sometimes just off to the side of the road and you know.
[02:03:24.699 --> 02:03:26.681]  But their slogan is safest city in the U.S.
[02:03:26.681 --> 02:03:28.342]  That's the only reason I knew that.
[02:03:28.342 --> 02:03:30.124]  Yeah, I thought that was pretty funny.
[02:03:30.124 --> 02:03:33.227]  I'm not trying to attack El Paso, but that's as close to hell as you can get.
[02:03:33.959 --> 02:03:40.861]  I mean, when I've driven through there and it's all those weird, like, it's like apocalyptic, all those crumbling mountains and antennas and military wreckage everywhere.
[02:03:40.861 --> 02:03:42.482]  I mean, it's weird, man.
[02:03:42.482 --> 02:03:44.082]  Well, it's definitely like being in Kuwait.
[02:03:44.082 --> 02:03:46.703]  I mean, I was scared a lot of times there.
[02:03:46.703 --> 02:03:50.864]  I mean, I told a lot of the guys when I came back from overseas, I was like, it's almost worse.
[02:03:50.864 --> 02:03:52.445]  I'd rather go back to Afghanistan.
[02:03:52.445 --> 02:03:53.005]  I kept begging.
[02:03:53.005 --> 02:03:53.865]  I was like, let me deploy.
[02:03:53.865 --> 02:03:57.266]  I'd rather be in Afghanistan than be in El Paso another day.
[02:03:59.158 --> 02:04:01.679]  I mean, I felt safer in Afghanistan sometimes.
[02:04:01.679 --> 02:04:07.221]  Yeah, you were saying that the apartments you stayed in were just full of FBI, DEA, but you'd hear shootings in the parking lot?
[02:04:07.221 --> 02:04:20.385]  Yeah, the FBI had their little building right across the street from where my apartment was, and then on base they have something called Epic El Paso Intelligence Center, and that's DEA, FBI, and all that stuff that they have there.
[02:04:21.357 --> 02:04:23.178]  That's the safest city in America.
[02:04:23.178 --> 02:04:23.859]  Yep.
[02:04:23.859 --> 02:04:25.741]  Well, man, good job for the press.
[02:04:25.741 --> 02:04:26.821]  Good job for freedom.
[02:04:26.821 --> 02:04:31.725]  Good job to just give some defiance to this charity and say, hey, we don't buy all your lies.
[02:04:31.725 --> 02:04:34.768]  And we appreciate you standing up for the press and for Michael Hastings.
[02:04:34.768 --> 02:04:35.829]  Thank you, sir, for having me.
[02:04:35.829 --> 02:04:36.229]  You bet.
[02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:39.572]  And I'm glad his wife's all at ease now and just says everything's wonderful.
[02:04:39.572 --> 02:04:41.654]  Yeah.
[02:04:41.654 --> 02:04:43.255]  I guess some people think it's all peachy now.
[02:04:43.255 --> 02:04:44.296]  I still don't think so, though.
[02:04:45.245 --> 02:04:47.848]  Well, I mean, come on, our government doesn't ever kill members of the press.
[02:04:47.848 --> 02:04:48.729]  No, never.
[02:04:48.729 --> 02:04:50.470]  And the NSA doesn't spy on us without warrants.
[02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:52.432]  And El Paso's the safest city.
[02:04:52.432 --> 02:04:55.916]  And the government doesn't ship drugs in.
[02:04:55.916 --> 02:04:58.919]  Oh, you're something else, Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[02:04:58.919 --> 02:04:59.500]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.556 --> 02:05:09.301]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:13.564]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[02:05:13.564 --> 02:05:27.693]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.

[02:06:17.734 --> 02:06:22.398]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:06:22.398 --> 02:06:26.622]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:06:26.622 --> 02:06:29.184]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:06:29.184 --> 02:06:35.409]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:08:12.009 --> 02:08:15.575]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:15.575 --> 02:08:19.742]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.198 --> 02:08:35.042]  There's an article up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com saying, real or hoax, 1960 subliminal national anthem video says obey government.
[02:08:35.042 --> 02:08:42.664]  Well, I know they've been caught doing that before, but they have overt subliminal messages in the media as well.
[02:08:42.664 --> 02:08:48.746]  We've got another Travis County, Texas Democrat charged with DWI, but then they don't ever step down or get in trouble.
[02:08:48.746 --> 02:08:50.887]  They are above the law.
[02:08:50.887 --> 02:08:53.408]  It looks like the district, the county attorney was involved.
[02:08:54.228 --> 02:08:58.692]  I mean it's just amazing and again that just fits into whoever's in power is above the law.
[02:08:58.692 --> 02:09:03.456]  Poll, only 11% trust Obama on NSA reform promises.
[02:09:03.456 --> 02:09:06.678]  That's by Steve Watson up at Infowars.com.
[02:09:06.678 --> 02:09:12.803]  Benghazi whistleblower lawyer, stolen Libyan missiles will be used to shoot down aircraft.
[02:09:12.803 --> 02:09:20.749]  That is really important news as our government engages in all sorts of
[02:09:22.378 --> 02:09:25.220]  Different operations arming those folks.
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:29.322]  Also, we're going to get into Snowden.
[02:09:29.322 --> 02:09:35.185]  After 9-11, media advocated its role as a check and balance on power.
[02:09:35.185 --> 02:09:37.167]  And the report we were just covering... Let me turn this mic off.
[02:09:37.167 --> 02:09:38.127]  I'm going to do some plugs here.
[02:09:38.127 --> 02:09:39.168]  Thanks.
[02:09:39.168 --> 02:09:39.668]  Report.
[02:09:39.668 --> 02:09:44.671]  Michael Hastings was investigating CIA Director John Brenham.
[02:09:46.016 --> 02:09:46.777]  Also, U.S.
[02:09:46.777 --> 02:09:52.985]  Army conducts military occupation drills in small-town Wisconsin.
[02:09:52.985 --> 02:09:58.812]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:58.812 --> 02:10:01.895]  Also, if you go up to DrugsReport.com, it's got the big coverage.
[02:10:01.895 --> 02:10:03.778]  We should do a blow-down article for our site.
[02:10:04.278 --> 02:10:18.895]  Of just all the betrayals, the doubling of premiums already up 50 plus percent, set to double by 2015, shutting down smaller HMOs and companies for the big guys, giving waivers to the Congress and insiders from Obamacare.
[02:10:20.448 --> 02:10:31.116]  Unpaid mandates, ballooning, I mean just the absolute economic warfare that Obamacare is meant to wreck our system.
[02:10:31.116 --> 02:10:33.778]  That is such important news as well.
[02:10:33.778 --> 02:10:38.442]  We're going to go to Dan Dix who's here in studio with us here in just a moment.
[02:10:38.942 --> 02:10:41.624]  But first off, I want to tell you about Infidel Body Armor.
[02:10:41.624 --> 02:10:49.348]  InfidelBodyArmor.com stops hundreds of rounds from AK-47, M4, 30-odd, 6308 and more.
[02:10:49.348 --> 02:10:52.690]  Chromatic, or ceramic, armor stops just six rounds.
[02:10:52.690 --> 02:10:53.790]  What about the seventh?
[02:10:53.790 --> 02:10:54.931]  This stops hundreds.
[02:10:54.931 --> 02:10:56.372]  Fits medium through XXL.
[02:10:56.372 --> 02:10:59.453]  They've got armored backpacks and a bunch of other great accessories.
[02:10:59.453 --> 02:11:00.754]  Really is award-winning.
[02:11:00.754 --> 02:11:02.075]  Rated Level 3 armor.
[02:11:02.595 --> 02:11:08.276]  You can give them a call and get a catalog or order or ask any questions, 888-608-6605.

[02:11:14.317 --> 02:11:19.518]  And finally, ladies and gentlemen, PrivateInternetAccess.com.
[02:11:19.518 --> 02:11:23.859]  We hear stories all the time about the NSA spying on people and Google doing it.
[02:11:23.859 --> 02:11:30.780]  You want to make it harder for hackers, not just the government, corrupt individuals, you name it, to be able to get your passwords, get your info.
[02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:38.243]  You lock your doors at night, you need to protect yourself, and they have the system that makes it all easy and does it all for you.
[02:11:38.243 --> 02:11:43.985]  Encrypts your internet connection, hides your IP address, provides firewall protection, provides uncensored access to complete internet.
[02:11:43.985 --> 02:11:53.089]  PrivateInternetAccess.com, based in the USA, can use service anywhere in the world with internet connection, and connected to five devices simultaneously with one account.
[02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:56.090]  PrivateInternetAccess.com.
[02:11:56.090 --> 02:11:57.851]  Start making it harder for the criminals.
[02:11:58.972 --> 02:12:03.756]  It's kind of like lining your house with lead now so the ground-penetrating radar can't look through.
[02:12:03.756 --> 02:12:07.880]  You have nothing to hide except your privacy and your freedom.
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:09.102]  Make it hard on the scum.
[02:12:10.697 --> 02:12:21.501]  All right, folks, I am really excited to have in studio with us one of my favorite filmmakers, and we carry several of the films he's produced at InfoWareStore.com if you want to check those out.
[02:12:21.501 --> 02:12:24.662]  Dan Dixon is an investigative journalist and documentary filmmaker.
[02:12:24.662 --> 02:12:27.923]  He's co-founder of Press For Truth, PressForTruth.ca.
[02:12:27.923 --> 02:12:29.364]  Twitter is PressForTruth.
[02:12:29.884 --> 02:12:36.911]  And Dan Dick's Twitter and Facebook, again, is dan.dicks.77 is his Facebook.
[02:12:36.911 --> 02:12:39.274]  And Dan, it's good to have you here in town.
[02:12:39.274 --> 02:12:46.361]  I have seen the incredible camera work you and your camera guy do, and I wanted some just amazing, dazzling shots for the new Obama Deception 2.
[02:12:47.242 --> 02:12:49.424]  We've got great camera people here, too, but they were nailed down.
[02:12:49.424 --> 02:12:51.866]  But I gotta say, I think you even take the cake.
[02:12:51.866 --> 02:13:00.073]  This looks like stuff you would see in films on Discovery or History or BBC, where it's all about the cinematography.
[02:13:00.073 --> 02:13:05.958]  And in the last week, you shot this on the East Coast for us, and you had your own little saga doing that.
[02:13:05.958 --> 02:13:07.680]  Good to have you here and tell folks what that was like.
[02:13:08.567 --> 02:13:13.052]  Well it's been one heck of an adventure over the last eight or nine days or whatever it's been.
[02:13:13.052 --> 02:13:21.162]  Going from Virginia, Philadelphia, New York, Washington DC, getting all kinds of great shots for the Obama deception.
[02:13:21.162 --> 02:13:23.284]  So it's been quite the adventure.
[02:13:23.284 --> 02:13:26.909]  We did run into a couple of snags with getting harassed and
[02:13:27.449 --> 02:13:28.970]  Especially Washington D.C.
[02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:33.014]  seems to be the place where they have issues with people using tripods.
[02:13:33.014 --> 02:13:40.140]  So we happen to have had a couple of officers come up to us saying, hey guys, you know, if you're going to be here, you're going to have to collapse those three legs into one.
[02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:44.003]  Because apparently it's okay to use a monopod and not a tripod.
[02:13:44.003 --> 02:13:48.907]  And one of the officers actually told me that it's because when you collapse the legs, it's not going to be as clear.
[02:13:49.688 --> 02:13:51.509]  Not as steady of a shot.
[02:13:51.509 --> 02:13:54.550]  And the moment you break them into three, you're going to have a nice shot.
[02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:56.450]  And I guess they don't want that.
[02:13:56.450 --> 02:14:03.873]  So we're getting a little... And by the way, I've been there with the national film crews from IFC, you name it.
[02:14:03.873 --> 02:14:05.893]  They don't give permits in the city.
[02:14:05.893 --> 02:14:06.573]  It's all a lie.
[02:14:06.573 --> 02:14:07.354]  There's no law.
[02:14:07.354 --> 02:14:08.594]  It's all fraud.
[02:14:08.594 --> 02:14:12.535]  And the truth is the Secret Service has told them it could be a missile launcher.
[02:14:12.535 --> 02:14:14.376]  That's why we don't want tripods.
[02:14:14.376 --> 02:14:17.377]  Even if you're five miles from the White House, it's just a way to harass people.
[02:14:17.657 --> 02:14:26.123]  Well, even with the technology we have now, there's image stabilizers, there's things you can do to get around this stuff, so it's really bureaucratic BS, really.
[02:14:26.123 --> 02:14:31.286]  We ran into similar things in New York, down by the Stock Exchange.
[02:14:31.286 --> 02:14:38.271]  One of the guys actually came up to us and said, you know, right in the middle of filming, he walks up in front of the camera and says, you know, this is all copyrighted.
[02:14:38.973 --> 02:14:40.373]  We said, what is?
[02:14:40.373 --> 02:14:41.614]  He said, all of this.
[02:14:41.614 --> 02:14:42.894]  We're like, the building?
[02:14:42.894 --> 02:14:45.155]  He said, yep, all of this is copyrighted.
[02:14:45.155 --> 02:14:51.157]  We have robots that will scan the internet and will look for this footage and we may find what you're using.
[02:14:51.157 --> 02:14:52.777]  No, but we have lawyers that'll sue them for that.
[02:14:52.777 --> 02:14:57.739]  I've already had to do that with their fake robots saying, my voice is owned or we can't show a building.
[02:14:57.739 --> 02:14:58.779]  That's all been thrown out.
[02:14:58.779 --> 02:15:01.980]  Plus, if it was a Disney film wanting to rope it off and shoot it,
[02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:05.661]  They might want to get an agreement, but still probably could beat it.
[02:15:05.661 --> 02:15:07.462]  This is news.
[02:15:07.462 --> 02:15:15.785]  We have a right to put out a documentary under the First Amendment and show the Stock Exchange, especially when they have embezzled trillions of dollars of taxpayer money.
[02:15:15.785 --> 02:15:16.225]  Exactly.
[02:15:16.225 --> 02:15:18.066]  And what about Google Street View?
[02:15:18.066 --> 02:15:20.367]  I mean, anybody can go on and look at this stuff online.
[02:15:20.367 --> 02:15:20.707]  No, no, no.
[02:15:20.707 --> 02:15:21.967]  It's pure harassment.
[02:15:21.967 --> 02:15:23.208]  It's pure color law.
[02:15:23.208 --> 02:15:25.649]  And somebody may have told that idiot that, but it doesn't mean it's true.
[02:15:26.169 --> 02:15:27.852]  And the place is filled with tourists.
[02:15:27.852 --> 02:15:30.655]  I mean, everybody around there has a camera.
[02:15:30.655 --> 02:15:33.179]  And they clearly singled us out.
[02:15:33.179 --> 02:15:35.062]  Maybe because of the tripod, but singled us out.
[02:15:35.062 --> 02:15:38.967]  Well, that's like the state police kept saying you can't film the Texas Capitol for commercial uses.
[02:15:38.967 --> 02:15:40.569]  That finally got thrown out in court.
[02:15:40.569 --> 02:15:41.971]  It's just people making stuff up!
[02:15:42.572 --> 02:15:46.994]  Yeah, it was pure intimidation, but we basically just stood our ground.
[02:15:46.994 --> 02:15:49.515]  I told them, you know what, we know we're in a public space right now.
[02:15:49.515 --> 02:15:51.796]  We know we're allowed to film right now.
[02:15:51.796 --> 02:15:54.117]  And so they would eventually leave us alone.
[02:15:54.117 --> 02:15:59.399]  But we certainly had our fair share of hassles on the road from people trying to stop us.
[02:15:59.399 --> 02:16:02.440]  I gotta say, though, it's not just your camera work.
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:03.421]  You guys have the eye.
[02:16:03.421 --> 02:16:07.022]  I mean, how did you become such a great photographer and videographer?
[02:16:07.022 --> 02:16:08.883]  And tell us about your associate.
[02:16:09.868 --> 02:16:13.211]  Yeah, I had my friend Steve Davies with me on this trip.
[02:16:13.211 --> 02:16:15.472]  He's an excellent camera guy.
[02:16:15.472 --> 02:16:24.919]  And, you know, I kind of fell into filmmaking back when I started Press for Truth in 2006 and just really started documenting protests, finding a lot of riot footage.
[02:16:24.919 --> 02:16:28.982]  So this is your natural, but it shows people don't think they could do stuff like this.
[02:16:28.982 --> 02:16:30.543]  A lot of people just have native talent.
[02:16:30.543 --> 02:16:31.164]  They should use it.
[02:16:31.758 --> 02:16:36.041]  Yeah, yeah, you know, I just dove in head first and took a stab at it.
[02:16:36.041 --> 02:16:41.826]  And, you know, right going into the first film as well, we knew, you know, we're going to have to license some music or something.
[02:16:41.826 --> 02:16:45.188]  So I thought, why don't I take a stab at doing that as well?
[02:16:45.188 --> 02:16:52.634]  So I gave that a shot and ended up doing the soundtracks and all the music for all five films now because I just tried it and it seemed to work out fine.
[02:16:52.634 --> 02:16:54.895]  So, yeah, it wasn't really,
[02:16:56.577 --> 02:16:58.880]  I just kind of fell into this kind of work.
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:02.724]  It's just kind of organically developed.
[02:17:02.724 --> 02:17:10.494]  You were angry about losing your liberty, got involved in the really smart thing, made it your business to self-fund resisting tyranny.
[02:17:10.494 --> 02:17:12.937]  That's the free market model that the globalists are scared of.
[02:17:13.177 --> 02:17:28.151]  That's exactly it, you know, and besides focusing on the filmmaking, I would consider myself an activist first and foremost, investigative journalist, and then, you know, a documentary filmmaker as well, but first and foremost, I would consider myself an activist.
[02:17:28.151 --> 02:17:34.677]  So, we do a lot of videos as well, not just full-length feature films, but shorter kind of videos for YouTube.
[02:17:35.598 --> 02:17:39.599]  Just to expose some of the things that are going on around in this world that people aren't learning about.
[02:17:39.599 --> 02:17:40.839]  Let's talk about your five films.
[02:17:40.839 --> 02:17:42.140]  We carry most of them.
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:45.281]  My favorite is the one on the North American Union.
[02:17:45.281 --> 02:17:49.722]  That's a great film to give somebody to explain how these corporations are taking over.
[02:17:49.722 --> 02:17:52.083]  We're not being conquered by the Russians or the Chinese.
[02:17:52.083 --> 02:17:53.603]  We're being conquered by the New World Order.
[02:17:53.923 --> 02:17:54.284]  That's right.
[02:17:54.284 --> 02:17:56.546]  That one's United We Fall.
[02:17:56.546 --> 02:17:58.668]  That took us about two years to make that one.
[02:17:58.668 --> 02:18:05.455]  We interviewed, you know, members of the Bilderberg Group, members of the Council on Foreign Relations, guys in the Trilateral Commission.
[02:18:05.455 --> 02:18:14.544]  Basically getting both sides of the issue here to have a fair and balanced film so people can make up their own minds about whether or not this
[02:18:15.044 --> 02:18:24.448]  North American Union concept is something that people are going to want to go for because it's being pushed down our throats right now, especially with the integrating all the securities at the borders.
[02:18:24.448 --> 02:18:28.289]  And you got them to admit things in there they were upset about later.
[02:18:28.289 --> 02:18:29.810]  I mean, you got some amazing admissions.
[02:18:30.350 --> 02:18:49.119]  Yeah, well, the trick there is to kind of play into their ego in the beginning of the, you know, I've read all your books, I've been following your work, and then they feel good about it, and then you wait to hit them up with the harder questions until, you know, halfway through the interview when the cameras are already rolling, and then you get those natural reactions from the tough questions.
[02:18:49.119 --> 02:18:54.822]  So, we were able to get a lot of good information out of these guys, because they didn't really know where we were coming from.
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:00.003]  Folks, everybody has got to get the film United We Fall.
[02:19:00.003 --> 02:19:02.305]  It's available at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:19:02.305 --> 02:19:06.108]  And it just reminds me how many great films are out there, how great your films are.
[02:19:06.108 --> 02:19:11.492]  These things deserve to have 10, 20 million, 30 million views, like Obama Deception on YouTube.
[02:19:11.492 --> 02:19:19.599]  They deserve, you allowed us to premiere them on PrisonPlanet.tv, The Nightly News, but I mean, these are just such great films.
[02:19:19.599 --> 02:19:20.940]  Tell folks about some of your other films.
[02:19:22.092 --> 02:19:29.135]  Yeah, the latest one we put out is the Turning Point that was documenting Bilderberg in Chantilly, Virginia back in 2012.
[02:19:29.135 --> 02:19:31.757]  It was there with you documenting the whole thing.
[02:19:31.757 --> 02:19:37.900]  And also Into the Fire is one of our bigger ones documenting the police state in Toronto, Toronto, Canada when the G20
[02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:40.001]  I came to Toronto back in 2010.
[02:19:40.001 --> 02:19:42.184]  That one's called Into the Fire.
[02:19:42.184 --> 02:19:48.991]  And then of course we have a six hour long informational package DVD on the Toronto hearings on 9-11 as well.
[02:19:48.991 --> 02:19:52.735]  And another one on the North American Union as well called The Nation's Deathbed.
[02:19:52.735 --> 02:19:57.940]  And people can get all that at PressForTruth.ca or my YouTube channel, YouTube.com slash WeavingSpider.
[02:19:57.940 --> 02:20:01.224]  Alright, we'll be back to talk about what's happening currently.
[02:20:01.824 --> 02:20:03.925]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:20:03.925 --> 02:20:11.949]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:20:11.949 --> 02:20:16.872]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:20:16.872 --> 02:20:18.773]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:20:19.053 --> 02:20:25.455]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[02:20:25.455 --> 02:20:33.677]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from E-Foods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[02:20:33.677 --> 02:20:40.059]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[02:20:40.059 --> 02:20:41.079]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[02:22:30.183 --> 02:22:31.304]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.304 --> 02:22:35.786]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.786 --> 02:22:41.490]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.490 --> 02:22:45.072]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.072 --> 02:22:47.753]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.753 --> 02:22:52.716]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:06.262]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.
[02:23:06.262 --> 02:23:12.765]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cells' ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health.
[02:23:12.765 --> 02:23:16.946]  Listen to the real-world results of Doug and his wife after taking One World Way.
[02:23:16.946 --> 02:23:18.327]  My name is Doug Diderot.
[02:23:18.327 --> 02:23:21.388]  For years, I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes.
[02:23:21.388 --> 02:23:24.809]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace.
[02:23:25.289 --> 02:23:31.974]  After being on One World Way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes.
[02:23:31.974 --> 02:23:37.398]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone.
[02:23:37.398 --> 02:23:44.404]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure.
[02:23:44.915 --> 02:23:45.195]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:23:47.677 --> 02:23:49.058]  Strange days have found us
[02:24:18.734 --> 02:24:20.457]  We're good.
[02:24:35.177 --> 02:24:37.139]  Alright, it's our final segment with Dan Dix.
[02:24:37.139 --> 02:24:40.041]  I'm tempted to get you back in studio tomorrow, but you're leaving tomorrow, aren't you?
[02:24:40.041 --> 02:24:43.064]  Yeah, we fly out tomorrow morning, heading back to Toronto, yeah.
[02:24:43.064 --> 02:24:44.845]  Well, we gotta get you back down here in the future.
[02:24:44.845 --> 02:24:45.966]  You're a great filmmaker.
[02:24:45.966 --> 02:24:49.489]  I'm really impressed with the work you're doing, and the rest of your team.
[02:24:49.489 --> 02:24:50.249]  But it just shows...
[02:24:51.164 --> 02:24:53.706]  That, I mean, I saw yourself immediately looked really good.
[02:24:53.706 --> 02:24:57.208]  I was like, wow, I wish I was a good filmmaker like that.
[02:24:57.208 --> 02:24:59.610]  And then it just got better and better.
[02:24:59.610 --> 02:25:05.995]  And I'm just, it's got to feel good and satisfying to have success from working hard.
[02:25:05.995 --> 02:25:11.819]  I mean, I just, that's what I admire is people that are really taking their passion for liberty and putting it to the enemy.
[02:25:11.819 --> 02:25:13.921]  What is your overall view of the state of the world right now?
[02:25:14.770 --> 02:25:29.800]  Overall view of the state of the world, well, things are certainly getting worse before they're going to get better, and that's why we're putting so much effort and so much time into exposing this information, getting this stuff out through the medium of video, which I find is the way to go.
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:31.701]  I mean, not a lot of people are reading these days.
[02:25:31.701 --> 02:25:34.804]  A lot of people are looking for information online.
[02:25:34.804 --> 02:25:36.345]  They're hungry for this information.
[02:25:37.245 --> 02:26:07.005]  YouTube seems to be the place to go so that's why I've kind of been focusing my energies on on creating videos that get people thinking putting this stuff out on YouTube so people can see some of the things that they're just simply not getting from the mainstream media and that's just basically what we absolutely and we've been so successful on YouTube they are doing algorithms and stuff to try to block us now the answer is everybody's got to get our info and get it out to everybody your info my info let's show one of these clips of the military coming over to you this was at the big station the train station right in New York
[02:26:07.565 --> 02:26:08.126]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:26:08.126 --> 02:26:15.831]  I went up to document some of these military guys walking around, you know, just patrolling New York Grand Central Station.
[02:26:15.831 --> 02:26:18.273]  And I walk up to one of the guys and he happens to recognize me.
[02:26:18.273 --> 02:26:20.495]  He says, hey, Press for Truth, I've seen your stuff.
[02:26:20.495 --> 02:26:21.976]  And I said, oh, really?
[02:26:21.976 --> 02:26:22.736]  See, that's an example.
[02:26:22.736 --> 02:26:24.397]  The military's more awake than anybody.
[02:26:24.397 --> 02:26:24.918]  Yeah.
[02:26:24.918 --> 02:26:27.740]  I'm telling you, the new order better get robots quick.
[02:26:27.740 --> 02:26:28.440]  Let's go to this clip.
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:29.081]  Let's go to this clip.
[02:26:29.081 --> 02:26:29.381]  Here it is.
[02:26:38.761 --> 02:26:41.165]  Here comes the military guy.
[02:26:41.165 --> 02:26:42.787]  What do you think of it?
[02:26:42.787 --> 02:26:45.972]  I guess it depends on what you saw.
[02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:53.251]  You know, that's good.
[02:26:53.251 --> 02:26:57.334]  There's so much background noise, and you guys weren't shooting for sound.
[02:26:57.334 --> 02:26:58.395]  You were shooting for the image.
[02:26:58.395 --> 02:27:03.318]  You said a little internal mic on it, but you can hear him saying, no, I've seen your stuff, press for truth.
[02:27:03.318 --> 02:27:04.519]  And then you asked him, you know, what he thought.
[02:27:04.519 --> 02:27:06.561]  He said, hey, turn your camera off and I'll tell you.
[02:27:06.561 --> 02:27:11.104]  Yeah, he basically said he looked like he wanted to talk to me about some of the stuff, but he said, yeah, I can't.
[02:27:11.104 --> 02:27:13.126]  I can't really because you got the camera going there.
[02:27:13.986 --> 02:27:16.468]  You know, you're rolling right now, so I can't tell you what you thought.
[02:27:16.468 --> 02:27:20.771]  But I kind of got the sense that he was not a fan, but that he liked this stuff.
[02:27:20.771 --> 02:27:24.854]  So, I don't know, maybe he was awake and maybe that's why he couldn't talk about it.
[02:27:24.854 --> 02:27:28.076]  No, I mean the guys that buried my great uncle two days ago.
[02:27:28.076 --> 02:27:30.217]  Turned out half of them were waving at me when they drove off.
[02:27:30.217 --> 02:27:30.678]  We're listeners.
[02:27:31.192 --> 02:27:32.033]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:27:32.033 --> 02:27:34.975]  I'm telling you, the military is our biggest audience.
[02:27:34.975 --> 02:27:35.676]  Yeah.
[02:27:35.676 --> 02:27:37.057]  What's the next clip?
[02:27:37.057 --> 02:27:46.445]  Well, there's a couple clips from when we were... There's one in Washington where they're telling us to collapse the tripod, and then that guy down at the Stock Market Exchange telling us this is all copyrighted footage.
[02:27:46.445 --> 02:27:47.626]  Again, it's very off the cuff.
[02:27:47.626 --> 02:27:50.308]  It just kind of has... Let's go to the next one, and I'll describe what it is.
[02:27:50.308 --> 02:27:51.689]  Let's go ahead and play the next one.
[02:27:58.955 --> 02:27:59.416]  Oh, okay.
[02:27:59.416 --> 02:28:01.678]  Well, we're pretty much done.
[02:28:01.678 --> 02:28:05.182]  Yeah, we're pretty much done.
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:15.421]  And again, this is mainly for TV viewers to see this.
[02:28:15.421 --> 02:28:18.162]  Radio listeners can't really make it out.
[02:28:18.162 --> 02:28:20.382]  He wasn't filming for the sound.
[02:28:20.382 --> 02:28:23.483]  Alright, let's go to the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:28:23.483 --> 02:28:25.204]  Footage.
[02:28:25.204 --> 02:28:32.126]  Oh yeah, this is it right here.
[02:28:32.126 --> 02:28:35.628]  Hey, I want to explain something to this guy right now.
[02:28:35.628 --> 02:28:36.748]  Uh, you know, uh...
[02:28:37.887 --> 02:28:47.794]  Sir, we're news gathering, A. B., just because you go pay a company with a bot to go around and make fake claims on people, that's when you get a real lawsuit.
[02:28:47.794 --> 02:28:50.116]  And I know you work at the New York Stock Exchange, you think you're God.
[02:28:50.116 --> 02:28:57.281]  It's in the news today that unsealed court documents reveal that banks stole trillions worth of homes.
[02:28:57.281 --> 02:29:00.043]  Yeah, banks were taking people's homes that were paid for.
[02:29:00.043 --> 02:29:02.565]  So, I mean, I guess maybe, maybe we're not allowed to film.
[02:29:02.565 --> 02:29:05.527]  I mean, maybe we're not allowed to live unless the New York Stock Exchange says so, Dan.
[02:29:06.727 --> 02:29:12.590]  Either way, this footage will be coming out, and I can't wait for people to see all this stuff in the Obama Deception Part 2.
[02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:14.711]  So, we're not going to let them intimidate us.
[02:29:14.711 --> 02:29:18.373]  We certainly didn't there, and we certainly are never going to moving forward.
[02:29:18.373 --> 02:29:20.374]  Like you said, we are gathering news.
[02:29:20.374 --> 02:29:25.636]  This is reporting on events that are taking place in the world, and people deserve to see what's going on.
[02:29:25.636 --> 02:29:26.196]  Absolutely.
[02:29:26.196 --> 02:29:31.939]  By the way, I had the Federal Reserve in San Antonio do a fake claim on us saying we couldn't show their building, and I had to file stuff on that.
[02:29:31.939 --> 02:29:33.320]  I mean, they just think they're God.
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:34.780]  And we're here to be stepped on.
[02:29:34.780 --> 02:29:35.480]  Well, we're not.

[02:33:24.994 --> 02:33:34.538]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.538 --> 02:33:37.279]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:33:37.279 --> 02:33:46.582]  Got about 27 minutes left in worldwide transmission here today on this Live Tuesday edition.
[02:33:47.657 --> 02:33:55.103]  And we've got another guest we're lining up right now who wrote The Spiritual Gift of Madness, Seth Farber, Ph.D.
[02:33:57.330 --> 02:34:05.178]  And we're going to be discussing with him how they're trying to list just any type of critical thinking as a mental illness now.
[02:34:05.178 --> 02:34:05.918]  So that's coming up.
[02:34:05.918 --> 02:34:09.261]  We're getting him some Skype issues sorted out with him right now.
[02:34:09.261 --> 02:34:13.866]  First off, I wanted to remind listeners that everybody should have firearms.
[02:34:13.866 --> 02:34:16.128]  Everybody should be trained how to use them to protect yourself.
[02:34:16.128 --> 02:34:17.409]  That's the most important thing.
[02:34:17.409 --> 02:34:19.091]  Your security is your job.
[02:34:19.091 --> 02:34:21.053]  Common law, common sense states that.
[02:34:22.432 --> 02:34:25.837]  It's not the police job to protect you, they have no liability to protect you.
[02:34:25.837 --> 02:34:28.421]  Though sometimes they are able to protect you.
[02:34:28.421 --> 02:34:31.586]  The point is, is that you also need storable food, you need water filtration.
[02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:38.952]  And the place to go to get the high quality, storable foods is efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find all their monthly specials.

[02:35:06.977 --> 02:35:08.217]  Also ladies and gentlemen,
[02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:21.372]  Again, we find ourselves with things that I believe in and I use.
[02:35:21.372 --> 02:35:36.762]  The Pro-Pure family of water filters, from their travel systems and their larger units that could be used at a restaurant, you name it, from stuff that fits in your RV, you know, is a foot tall and a foot wide or whatever, to, you know, bigger units, they're all discounted at the lowest prices anywhere.
[02:35:36.762 --> 02:35:39.064]  The best stainless steel gravity-fed filters anywhere.
[02:35:39.064 --> 02:35:43.587]  Side-by-side comparisons annihilates the leading competitors and all of their competition.
[02:35:43.587 --> 02:35:44.647]  That's why we sell it.
[02:35:44.647 --> 02:35:45.288]  We sell the best.
[02:35:45.808 --> 02:35:49.151]  ProPure with the Pro1 water filtration to cut out the fluoride.
[02:35:49.151 --> 02:35:50.292]  You name it.
[02:35:50.292 --> 02:35:55.777]  InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll free and with the promo code water.
[02:35:55.777 --> 02:35:57.558]  You also get 10% off when you call.
[02:35:57.558 --> 02:35:57.658]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:05.265 --> 02:36:07.188]  Your family deserves this and needs this.
[02:36:07.188 --> 02:36:09.151]  There's so many toxins in the environment.
[02:36:09.151 --> 02:36:11.714]  Filtering your water is one of the most important things you can do.
[02:36:11.714 --> 02:36:13.156]  I don't need to tell you that.
[02:36:13.156 --> 02:36:14.057]  I think you know that.
[02:36:14.057 --> 02:36:15.700]  Then stop procrastinating.
[02:36:15.700 --> 02:36:19.124]  All of us know what we should do, but do we follow through with it?
[02:36:19.124 --> 02:36:20.346]  And yes, your purchase then...
[02:36:21.207 --> 02:36:22.868]  We'll be poured.
[02:36:22.868 --> 02:36:26.091]  Right now, I'm pouring over 100% of the money we've been made in the last year.
[02:36:26.091 --> 02:36:34.276]  I've been going into savings, backup savings, to try to finish the TV studio, the uplinks, the plan, the reporters, the writers, the researchers.
[02:36:34.276 --> 02:36:38.159]  I mean, we are busy doing a full-time job, but we're getting it all done.
[02:36:38.159 --> 02:36:39.100]  We're moving as fast as we can.
[02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:45.605]  I threw a fit this morning over the fact that we need to get everything myself, I'm at it myself, get it all going to the next level.
[02:36:45.605 --> 02:36:47.966]  I don't want to reach 15 million people a week like we're reaching.
[02:36:47.966 --> 02:36:48.467]  I want to reach 100 million.
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:50.941]  I want to change history.
[02:36:50.941 --> 02:36:51.901]  I want to have a future.
[02:36:51.901 --> 02:36:55.223]  I want to stop the globalists raping this country and what's happening.
[02:36:55.223 --> 02:36:57.465]  I'm upset about it.
[02:36:57.465 --> 02:37:10.673]  Just like Michael Hastings at Rolling Stone was, saying they're persecuting the press, they're coming after our liberties, the press has to get together against this corrupt government, it's bipartisan, it's been taken over, we're in trouble, the FBI's after me, I've got the big story, boom, his car blows up.
[02:37:11.633 --> 02:37:12.734]  Why's that guy so upset?
[02:37:12.734 --> 02:37:23.019]  Because he learned things that upset him, and he had a normal, moral imperative, not as a goody two-shoes, but as an instinct to not be a slave to stand up against it.
[02:37:23.019 --> 02:37:26.501]  So get your probe here at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:37:26.501 --> 02:37:29.922]  Got a lot of other great water filtration stuff, the LifeStraw for the field.
[02:37:29.922 --> 02:37:33.644]  I gotta go out and do a demonstration, you can take swamp water, pull it up, and then drink it.
[02:37:33.644 --> 02:37:35.926]  I mean, it's amazing.

[02:37:51.568 --> 02:37:56.955]  All right ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:56.955 --> 02:37:57.436]  We have Dr.
[02:38:04.773 --> 02:38:09.976]  We have Dr. Seth Farber joining us here on the broadcast.
[02:38:09.976 --> 02:38:15.539]  PhD, Institute of Mind and Behavior, New York City.
[02:38:15.539 --> 02:38:18.461]  He's a writer, social critic, dissident psychologist.
[02:38:18.461 --> 02:38:23.884]  He received his doctorate in 1984 and co-founder of the Network Against Coercive Psychiatry.
[02:38:23.884 --> 02:38:32.709]  A critic of the mental health system, Dr. Farber believes many people have been wrongly diagnosed with mental disorders in an effort to build a captive market for drug companies.
[02:38:33.029 --> 02:38:33.489]  I'm a schizophrenic
[02:39:03.389 --> 02:39:10.394]  In the newspaper, actually, they were saying, I'm delusional that we have a corrupt government.
[02:39:10.394 --> 02:39:27.086]  Psychology Today had a psychologist, actually he was a psychologist, who worked for the Obama administration and Clinton, come out and say he believes I'm mentally ill, because I believed in NSA spying, I believed in secret police, I believed in NDAA.
[02:39:27.086 --> 02:39:29.088]  That was two years ago, now all that stuff's admitted.
[02:39:30.286 --> 02:39:37.609]  And I guess if I was in Nazi Germany 65 years ago and said Hitler was a bad guy, they probably would have locked me up too, saying I was crazy.
[02:39:37.609 --> 02:39:40.590]  He used psychiatry and corrupt psychologists as well.
[02:39:40.590 --> 02:39:42.610]  So thank you for joining us, sir.
[02:39:42.610 --> 02:39:44.331]  You're really one of the leading experts on this.
[02:39:44.331 --> 02:39:50.153]  We also have your amazing book, The Spiritual Gift of Madness, The Failure of Psychiatry.
[02:39:50.153 --> 02:39:53.334]  We don't sell it, but it's available everywhere we should be selling it.
[02:39:53.334 --> 02:39:57.435]  Tell folks about your awakening and what we face and where all this is going.
[02:39:57.435 --> 02:39:59.136]  And then separately, I want to ask you
[02:40:00.402 --> 02:40:18.728]  About the fact that I do see, not what I'd call so much mental illness, but people that are really screwed up, who are nothing but pure, kind of a narcissist, obsessed with status, obsessed with sitcoms, drama, kind of the Madison Avenue shallowness that I think robs their humanity.
[02:40:18.728 --> 02:40:23.789]  Because I do think there is such a thing as screwed up people, obviously, and some people that have chemical imbalances.
[02:40:23.789 --> 02:40:29.431]  But break down your awakening and your stance on what's really going on in the human brain.
[02:40:30.131 --> 02:40:43.161]  Okay, what you said, Alex, reminded me exactly of how the psychiatric system was used in the Soviet Union to lock up dissidents, and they were called schizophrenics.
[02:40:43.161 --> 02:40:56.111]  And to call you a leader in the movement against the development of an oppressive state that deprives Americans of their constitutional rights shows, in fact, that the psychiatric
[02:40:57.572 --> 02:41:05.976]  Institute is not a scientific process, the process of their psychiatric Bible, the DSM-5.
[02:41:05.976 --> 02:41:21.003]  And I have been saying this for years, that there's really no difference between the way psychiatry, you know, little differences, but basically it functions as a tool of suppression in America, as it did in the Soviet Union.
[02:41:21.003 --> 02:41:24.205]  And this has become, for example,
[02:41:25.645 --> 02:41:26.986]  You were called up.
[02:41:26.986 --> 02:41:35.233]  I myself, one time, I was a critic of the burgeoning child welfare system in the nineties.
[02:41:35.233 --> 02:41:50.185]  And I went into court for a, there were people who had their children dumped, I know you've talked about this before, many people in New York who had their children taken away by the child welfare system, and this is just one example, and when they protest,
[02:41:50.845 --> 02:42:00.669]  And if they speak of, well, I think that the court is collaborating with the Child Welfare, immediately they got labeled paranoid.
[02:42:00.669 --> 02:42:11.774]  And when I went into court as an expert witness for a person, at the end, the other side, the lawyers for the other side, the Child Welfare, tried to prevent me from
[02:42:13.425 --> 02:42:20.030]  Uh, giving my expert, uh, testimony on my client who had her children, her child taken away from her.
[02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:30.658]  The judge let me testify, but at the end of the whole thing, it was me and another social worker and we both testified that, uh, the woman's name was D'Andrea, uh, was perfectly sane, um,
[02:42:32.599 --> 02:42:39.663]  Now, she was going on record as being distrustful of the child welfare system and of the court system.
[02:42:39.663 --> 02:42:48.687]  Well, even by their own standards in the DSM-IV at the time, paranoia is not a distrust of the government.
[02:42:48.687 --> 02:42:51.629]  It's a pervasive distrust, as it was defined.
[02:42:52.529 --> 02:43:02.791]  But what they did was, in order to disqualify my testimony, they said that I myself had been inducted into my patient's delusional system.
[02:43:02.791 --> 02:43:10.233]  So, we see how psychiatry has been used as a tool of political suppression.
[02:43:10.233 --> 02:43:16.314]  By the way, Ernest Hemingway, for those that don't know, said the FBI was harassing him and tabbing his phones, was declassified.
[02:43:16.874 --> 02:43:20.115]  About a decade ago that indeed they were harassing him and tapping his phones.
[02:43:20.115 --> 02:43:24.776]  They had him grabbed and electroshocked, destroying his wonderful mind.
[02:43:24.776 --> 02:43:29.598]  And then he later committed suicide because he was so depressed.
[02:43:29.598 --> 02:43:34.499]  So that's an example of how these people operate and it's ridiculous.
[02:43:34.499 --> 02:43:40.601]  The New York child welfare system is on record testing lethal drugs on kids until they die.
[02:43:40.601 --> 02:43:42.262]  You better be paranoid of that!
[02:43:42.782 --> 02:43:44.083]  Yes.
[02:43:44.083 --> 02:43:51.388]  We have a terrible... Robert Whitaker is documented in his books and Peter Bragan.
[02:43:51.388 --> 02:44:02.657]  We have, because of the growing psychiatric pharmaceutical industrial complex, we have one-fourth of American women are now on psychiatric drugs that don't do any good.
[02:44:02.657 --> 02:44:06.740]  Antidepressants and so-called anti-psychotics, which cause all kinds of...
[02:44:09.082 --> 02:44:18.959]  The man, this psychiatrist that did a study on it, Irving Kirsch, wrote a book on it, showed that actually the antidepressants don't do any better than placebos.
[02:44:19.619 --> 02:44:23.842]  By the way, I've read your writings and I know about you.
[02:44:23.842 --> 02:44:25.663]  You're obviously hyper-intelligent.
[02:44:25.663 --> 02:44:26.303]  What is it?
[02:44:26.303 --> 02:44:27.704]  I'm not bragging about myself either.
[02:44:27.704 --> 02:44:29.986]  Not that I'm super-intelligent, but I'm not dumb.
[02:44:29.986 --> 02:44:36.510]  People think if you are electric, alive, smart, inventive, that that's weird.
[02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:43.915]  I see the general public acting like zombies, and then if I act excited about something, about art or anything, it's like weird.
[02:44:43.915 --> 02:44:45.596]  Like, why are you upset?
[02:44:45.596 --> 02:44:47.057]  Or why are you excited?
[02:44:47.057 --> 02:44:49.599]  Like, I'm only supposed to get excited about football or something.
[02:44:50.099 --> 02:44:51.500]  Yes.
[02:44:51.500 --> 02:44:55.102]  Increasingly, people... That's not you.
[02:44:55.102 --> 02:44:57.243]  I'm going to take the... I'm sorry.
[02:44:57.243 --> 02:44:59.544]  People are labeled manic.
[02:44:59.544 --> 02:45:03.886]  I mean, they have now, you know, broadened the definition of manic in such a way.
[02:45:03.886 --> 02:45:10.289]  Plus, they try to get these people, like children, who show an enthusiasm in the classroom and
[02:45:13.031 --> 02:45:15.511]  Bruce Levine, the psychologist, has written about this.
[02:45:15.511 --> 02:45:31.257]  They're not interested in the classwork, but if you test them intellectually and cognitively, they do as well, if not better, than so-called normal children on all the cognitive tests except one.
[02:45:31.937 --> 02:45:34.540]  Route learning and memorization.
[02:45:34.540 --> 02:45:43.150]  So, you know, they don't have the same tolerance of the kind of Pavlom that they're taught in school.
[02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:45.573]  That's right, they reject Pavlovian programming.
[02:45:47.094 --> 02:45:48.415]  And they get labeled.
[02:45:48.415 --> 02:46:07.832]  I mean, the clearest example of it, of the fallacious nature of psychiatric labeling, of course, was the 1977 vote in the American Psychiatric Association, when overnight homosexuality went from being classified as a disease to an illness.
[02:46:08.573 --> 02:46:17.318]  Now, you don't vote, you don't find specialists voting on whether cancer is an illness or not.
[02:46:17.318 --> 02:46:20.660]  And yet, this is the way psychiatry proceeds.
[02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:31.086]  And even the editor of the Psychiatric Bible, this Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Diseases, who
[02:46:32.587 --> 02:46:33.208]  We're good.
[02:46:48.379 --> 02:46:54.123]  Gentlemen and a few women, mostly gentlemen, get together and decide what is sane and what is insane.
[02:46:54.123 --> 02:46:54.623]  Exactly.
[02:46:54.623 --> 02:46:59.526]  It's like some type of papal council deciding on what in the Bible is true or not.
[02:46:59.526 --> 02:47:11.975]  And then they'll contradict what they said 10 years before, showing that it's all just their opinions and then who finances them but Big Pharma to where they're now saying, I've seen these questionnaires to 11-year-old girls, do you ever get upset?
[02:47:11.975 --> 02:47:13.316]  Do you ever have anxiety?
[02:47:13.316 --> 02:47:14.496]  Do you ever cry?
[02:47:14.496 --> 02:47:18.319]  Well, you need serotonin reuptake inhibitors, my darling.
[02:47:18.979 --> 02:47:20.700]  Yes.
[02:47:20.700 --> 02:47:27.402]  And this has spread to the point where Francis talks about the medicalization of normality.
[02:47:27.402 --> 02:47:37.106]  You know, I became a critic of the system a few years after my PhD, and at that time there was still talk about the Rosenhan experiment.
[02:47:37.486 --> 02:47:39.468]  Do people still know about that one?
[02:47:39.468 --> 02:47:43.212]  Because I swear to you, that same thing would happen today.
[02:47:43.212 --> 02:47:44.333]  They made no progress.
[02:47:44.333 --> 02:47:58.808]  That was when David Rosenhan, the psychologist, wanted to test how good his fellow colleagues in mental hospitals and psychiatric wards were at detecting schizophrenia.
[02:47:59.389 --> 02:48:09.133]  So he and a couple others, about 12 confederates of his, got into the loony bin by pretending they were hearing sounds.
[02:48:09.133 --> 02:48:10.913]  They didn't actually say voices.
[02:48:10.913 --> 02:48:11.554]  They all got in.
[02:48:11.554 --> 02:48:14.135]  They were diagnosed schizophrenics and they couldn't get out.
[02:48:14.135 --> 02:48:15.215]  They acted normal.
[02:48:18.032 --> 02:48:34.028]  They could not convince the psychiatrists that they were normal, and they were examined by psychologists and psychiatrists, and each one said, well, they had a terrible... When they interviewed them, they said, well, the terrible child had actually produced a predisposition towards schizophrenia.
[02:48:34.028 --> 02:48:34.808]  So, you know...
[02:48:35.529 --> 02:48:41.819]  Well, Americans should not put their trust in doctors who can't tell who's sane and who's insane.
[02:48:41.819 --> 02:48:46.926]  Now, that was an experiment done in the 70s, but I find the same thing today.
[02:48:46.926 --> 02:48:49.770]  My first client was labeled schizophrenic.
[02:48:49.770 --> 02:48:50.492]  He heard a voice.
[02:48:52.213 --> 02:49:04.136]  This is what I say mad pride, because the mad pride movement says people can be different without being mentally ill, without being stigmatized, without meaning there is something wrong with them.
[02:49:04.136 --> 02:49:13.758]  And that was done so beautifully by the development of the mental patients liberation movement in the 1970s, when here these were these people that were supposed to be.
[02:49:13.758 --> 02:49:15.918]  That's the other side of the Rosenhan experiment.
[02:49:16.218 --> 02:49:26.946]  These were people who did have voices, who did have breakdowns, but became political activists and say, you can't do this to the government and to the psychiatric establishment.
[02:49:26.946 --> 02:49:30.849]  You cannot make us take these drugs because they are killing us.
[02:49:30.849 --> 02:49:31.989]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[02:49:34.124 --> 02:49:42.108]  So many times I see it as toxic waste and chemicals associated with things like schizophrenia, the old Mad Hatter thing, people working in factories.
[02:49:42.108 --> 02:49:57.675]  You would have higher ratios of it, but I am seeing more and more, and I don't really study psychology, but what I would call narcissistic breakdowns, where people just have lost touch of what reality is, but the system doesn't even call them insane.
[02:49:57.675 --> 02:50:00.216]  That's kind of like a manufactured corporate
[02:50:01.150 --> 02:50:02.191]  Weirdness.
[02:50:02.191 --> 02:50:04.151]  But then they don't call that crazy.
[02:50:04.151 --> 02:50:07.753]  I see people going along with the system as mentally ill.
[02:50:07.753 --> 02:50:09.073]  That's exactly what R.D.
[02:50:09.073 --> 02:50:10.074]  Lange said.
[02:50:10.074 --> 02:50:12.295]  Are you familiar with Ronald David Lange?
[02:50:12.295 --> 02:50:13.495]  No, I'm not.
[02:50:13.495 --> 02:50:17.677]  Who became a celebrity in the 60s when he said that normal people are crazy.
[02:50:17.677 --> 02:50:22.419]  He said the well-adjusted bomber pilot, this was during the war in Vietnam, now they have
[02:50:22.699 --> 02:50:27.740]  But now they have been dropping bombs without any pilots in the planes on innocent people.
[02:50:27.740 --> 02:50:36.642]  He said the well-adjusted bomber pilot is actually a greater threat to the survival of the species than the schizophrenic who thinks there's a bomb inside him.
[02:50:36.642 --> 02:50:46.805]  So, I mean, there are people in positions of power and authority in America who are doing terrible things who are, I mean, they're responsible in the psychiatric pharmaceutical complex.
[02:50:47.365 --> 02:50:50.367]  And for those that don't know, that causes major brain damage.
[02:50:50.367 --> 02:50:51.168]  That's in the news.
[02:50:51.168 --> 02:50:56.251]  I'm no doctor like you, but don't those antipsychotics really hurt the brain?
[02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:14.982]  They do, they cause a Parkinson's-like system called Tardive Dyskinesia.
[02:51:14.982 --> 02:51:19.343]  Now, they claim the new ones don't, but that's because the tests were really rigged.
[02:51:19.343 --> 02:51:28.666]  But they cause diabetes, and they still do cause Tardive Dyskinesia if you're on them for a long period of time, which is... What about this?
[02:51:28.666 --> 02:51:29.887]  Because I know you run about this.
[02:51:29.887 --> 02:51:35.849]  The really smart people I've known, like mathematicians with 180 IQs and incredible musicians and people that...
[02:51:36.489 --> 02:51:45.016]  It seems that throughout history, this has been done by the ancients, what they call insanity is generally paired with hyper-intelligence and creativity.
[02:51:45.016 --> 02:51:47.599]  I mean, is that a fable, or have you seen that?
[02:51:47.599 --> 02:51:48.920]  I have seen that.
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:51.682]  That's why I support the Mayan pride movement.
[02:51:51.682 --> 02:51:56.286]  I thought that was such a brilliant idea when Sacha DeBrow in 2005 took a different
[02:51:59.008 --> 02:52:09.712]  Before that, you had the Mental Patients Liberation Movement, which was, once again, led by a group of people who were supposed to be incompetent and incapable, because they were all labeled schizophrenic, the majority of them.
[02:52:09.712 --> 02:52:18.435]  He gave it a different twist and said, a lot of us are hyper-creative, and we have hyper-unusual ways of thinking about the world.
[02:52:18.435 --> 02:52:24.198]  And I have found over and over again that the person that gets labeled today, they get labeled bipolar.
[02:52:24.198 --> 02:52:26.539]  When I was in school in the 80s, they were labeled schizophrenic.
[02:52:28.201 --> 02:52:29.487]  They tend to be more creative.
[02:52:29.487 --> 02:52:31.496]  You will find genetically that, uh...
[02:52:31.874 --> 02:52:39.359]  There's a higher amount of what's called off... well, I'll call it off-the-wall thinking.
[02:52:39.359 --> 02:52:42.541]  Discrepant thinking, but it's really the basis of creativity.
[02:52:42.541 --> 02:52:47.164]  Whereas the normal people, we would call... I would call them sociopaths.
[02:52:47.164 --> 02:52:52.027]  I mean, because here they are doing these things, often aware... Well, they're more like robots.
[02:52:52.027 --> 02:52:54.609]  Programmable, demonic robots.
[02:52:54.609 --> 02:52:55.330]  Right.
[02:52:55.330 --> 02:53:00.473]  Who will... I mean, I use the example, but it's just... it's culturally... they're not even like real people.
[02:53:00.473 --> 02:53:01.614]  They just do whatever they're told.
[02:53:02.094 --> 02:53:05.158]  Yes, they have no conscience.
[02:53:05.158 --> 02:53:08.822]  You're right, they're like cogs in the machine.
[02:53:08.822 --> 02:53:17.292]  And Lange talked about it in the 60s when he said the crazy people were really beginning to see, the people labeled schizophrenic were
[02:53:17.432 --> 02:53:36.356]  Beginning to see light and they may be lost and they may be having troubles, but they were spiritually exploring things, whereas the normal people, the psychologists, the ones who made the rules, the one who say whether homosexuality is an illness or whether it's not, the one who today are putting all our youngsters on psychiatric drugs.
[02:53:36.836 --> 02:53:40.442]  And they call them anti-psychotics.
[02:53:40.442 --> 02:53:43.426]  That in itself, they are cogs in the wheel.
[02:53:43.426 --> 02:53:47.492]  But what's disturbing, as you say, is that they do it without any conscience.
[02:53:47.492 --> 02:53:48.874]  Just as if they're machines.
[02:53:48.874 --> 02:53:50.036]  Just as if they're robots.
[02:53:51.701 --> 02:53:57.549]  Well, listen, in the 5-6 minutes we've got left, I want to get back up for a full hour sometime to take calls.
[02:53:57.549 --> 02:54:07.842]  I see the artificiality of the GMO, the vaccines, all the studies, the brain damage, the 10,000% increases in pediatric cancers, thousands percentile in diabetes.
[02:54:07.842 --> 02:54:09.765]  We know this modern system's killing us.
[02:54:10.325 --> 02:54:16.552]  And then when we say something's wrong in society, let's even find the answer we're told, you're crazy.
[02:54:16.552 --> 02:54:22.338]  Now the people saying this, they know that opposition to corrupt authority isn't mentally ill.
[02:54:22.338 --> 02:54:27.644]  I mean, they would label the Founding Fathers, or Goethe, or Voltaire as mentally ill.
[02:54:28.104 --> 02:54:36.131]  Yes, but well, they have the definition, oppositional defiant disorder.
[02:54:36.131 --> 02:54:39.714]  And so they label, and that's why I compared it to Russia.
[02:54:39.714 --> 02:54:49.642]  You have young people who aren't going along with the system, who may, you know, don't find school boring, but will come home and spend hours on the computer.
[02:54:49.642 --> 02:54:51.784]  They get labeled attention deficit disorder.
[02:54:52.304 --> 02:54:52.444]  I think?
[02:55:07.415 --> 02:55:23.650]  For example, David Oakes, who was the founder of Mind Freedom, which is the largest mental patients liberation organization in the country, when they first gave him this drug, he had a terrible reaction to it, as most people I know do to these antidepressants.
[02:55:24.370 --> 02:55:30.675]  The establishment is always trying to push the drugs on them and say, well, we need to do this to protect America.
[02:55:30.675 --> 02:55:35.259]  That's always the line, you know, like the National Security Association.
[02:55:35.259 --> 02:55:37.480]  We're doing this to protect you.
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:42.764]  And, you know, they always can find an example of someone who did something frightening.
[02:55:42.764 --> 02:55:44.626]  And for that one person who did something
[02:55:45.066 --> 02:55:45.506]  Sure, sure.
[02:55:45.506 --> 02:55:53.772]  Well, my dad going to UT, you know, did his residency stuff, part of it at the state mental hospital, and he only worked there a few months and couldn't do it anymore.
[02:55:53.772 --> 02:56:01.918]  He said the people running it were ten times crazier than the people that were in it down here off Shoal Creek in Austin, Texas.
[02:56:01.918 --> 02:56:02.159]  Yeah.
[02:56:03.391 --> 02:56:04.832]  And they're destroyed by the drugs.
[02:56:04.832 --> 02:56:08.513]  When they want to get off the drugs, that is called an illness, too.
[02:56:08.513 --> 02:56:10.034]  Did you know that, Alex?
[02:56:10.034 --> 02:56:13.695]  Just the fact that they want to get off the drugs is considered an illness.
[02:56:13.695 --> 02:56:15.656]  They call it non-compliance.
[02:56:15.656 --> 02:56:19.397]  They say they don't want to get... Yeah, really, they're authoritarians.
[02:56:19.397 --> 02:56:32.042]  Like, there are some problems out there, but they're authoritarians just using this as a power grab and as an excuse to be abusive because they want to carry out these dreams of being sadists.
[02:56:32.762 --> 02:56:53.257]  Exactly, and because they're rewarded for it now, in 1978, the American Psychiatric Association got together and said, we are facing, and you can read this in my book and in Peter Bragin's book, we are facing too much competition from social workers and psychologists who are doing therapy.
[02:56:53.257 --> 02:56:56.039]  The only way that we can survive and flourish is if we
[02:56:56.599 --> 02:56:57.519]  Accept money.
[02:56:57.519 --> 02:57:00.441]  They had laws and rules against accepting money.
[02:57:00.441 --> 02:57:02.561]  There were some ethical boundaries.
[02:57:02.561 --> 02:57:04.682]  There are no ethical boundaries.
[02:57:04.682 --> 02:57:13.886]  Like in 1978, when Peter Bragan warned against that, it was like Eisenhower warning against the military-industrial complex.
[02:57:14.446 --> 02:57:34.372]  Because just as we have a military-industrial complex that needs wars, that profits from wars, so we have a psychiatric-industrial complex that profits from putting our children on these awful so-called medications that are really destructive drugs.
[02:57:34.372 --> 02:57:36.593]  I mentioned children, but it's adults as well.
[02:57:37.193 --> 02:57:49.160]  Well, yeah, I mean, as you know, almost every mass shooter's been on these, and their answer is more psychiatric stuff, more kids on drugs, and the insert says can make you go totally delusional and kill people.
[02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:54.244]  Almost every one of the school shooter was on the SSRIs, the Prozac type drugs.
[02:57:54.244 --> 02:57:56.145]  As a doctor that studies this, what's happening there?
[02:57:57.965 --> 02:58:02.927]  I mean, why does shrimp swim up to fish and let them be eaten when they're on Prozac?
[02:58:02.927 --> 02:58:05.889]  I mean, what is it doing?
[02:58:05.889 --> 02:58:06.349]  We don't know.
[02:58:06.349 --> 02:58:15.953]  It's a very strange drug because it produces this class of drugs that was lauded by Peter Kramer that makes some people go crazy.
[02:58:15.953 --> 02:58:23.156]  Now, if you read in the paper about a guy who kills his girlfriend, it may not be on Prozac, but if he kills his mother, he kills his kids,
[02:58:23.536 --> 02:58:27.259]  You look closer, and then you're gonna find that guy is on SSRIs.
[02:58:27.259 --> 02:58:30.182]  They should have been banned by the FDA, but... No kidding.
[02:58:30.182 --> 02:58:30.542]  Stay there.
[02:58:30.542 --> 02:58:31.343]  Let's do five more minutes.
[02:58:31.343 --> 02:58:31.943]  This is too important.
[02:58:31.943 --> 02:58:33.084]  I gotta get this guy back on.
[02:58:33.084 --> 02:58:34.125]  No, no, that's true.
[02:58:34.125 --> 02:58:39.189]  Any cop I talk to, if somebody's killed their children for no reason, they know she's gonna be on these.
[02:58:39.189 --> 02:58:40.230]  This is unnatural.
[02:58:40.230 --> 02:58:46.195]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.195 --> 02:58:48.417]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.747 --> 02:58:53.848]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:58:53.848 --> 02:59:01.870]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:59:01.870 --> 02:59:06.812]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:59:06.812 --> 02:59:09.733]  The problem is we can't help everybody if every one of
[02:59:09.753 --> 02:59:10.513]  We're good to go.

[02:59:52.139 --> 02:59:58.924]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.970 --> 03:00:10.794]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.794 --> 03:00:12.396]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.396 --> 03:00:13.937]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.937 --> 03:00:18.121]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.121 --> 03:00:23.265]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.265 --> 03:00:25.808]  SethHFarber.com.
[03:00:25.808 --> 03:00:27.869]  SethHFarber.com is his website.
[03:00:28.630 --> 03:00:33.795]  His book, The Spiritual Gift of Madness, is very good, very thought-provoking, the other side of the story.
[03:00:33.795 --> 03:00:37.638]  Look, there's no doubt psychiatry and psychology is predatory now.
[03:00:37.638 --> 03:00:41.482]  There's some good people in it that do help folks, and a lot of them have spoken out.
[03:00:41.482 --> 03:00:43.423]  I mean, so there's some truth to all of it.
[03:00:43.423 --> 03:00:49.208]  There's truth to archetypes and unions, psychology, there's a lot of good stuff there in my humble view.
[03:00:50.209 --> 03:00:51.770]  And there are good counselors.
[03:00:51.770 --> 03:00:53.452]  There's some good there.
[03:00:53.452 --> 03:00:56.714]  But the thing directing it is Big Pharma.
[03:00:56.714 --> 03:00:59.976]  And they know full well what these drugs are doing.
[03:00:59.976 --> 03:01:05.400]  I know so many people that have car wrecks and have a hurt back and they go, I think you're depressed.
[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:08.322]  Here's the hospital psychologist.
[03:01:08.322 --> 03:01:11.344]  We need to put you on Luvox or whatever it is.
[03:01:12.285 --> 03:01:15.366]  Now, I know people that go on this stuff that are totally different people.
[03:01:15.366 --> 03:01:20.347]  Now, if somebody's completely out of their mind or whatever, trying to kill people, psychotic, yeah, whatever.
[03:01:20.347 --> 03:01:22.848]  But the point is, it's definitely predatory.
[03:01:22.848 --> 03:01:24.409]  It's the new form of slavery.
[03:01:24.409 --> 03:01:28.690]  And I wanted to give you some final comments, Dr. Seth Farber, on this subject.
[03:01:28.690 --> 03:01:34.772]  Because if we live in a country where they can have psychology today, because, I mean, I run a crew of over 50 people.
[03:01:34.772 --> 03:01:37.632]  I work 17 hours a day, 16 hours a day.
[03:01:37.632 --> 03:01:38.993]  I'm a smart, hardworking guy.
[03:01:39.853 --> 03:01:44.821]  And I know what I'm talking about, and break national news stories every week, and they say I'm mentally ill.
[03:01:44.821 --> 03:01:47.204]  We know this is a political weapon.
[03:01:47.204 --> 03:01:48.065]  Right.
[03:01:48.065 --> 03:01:53.533]  Yes, they did that to Barry Goldwater when he ran for president in 1960.
[03:01:53.533 --> 03:01:54.875]  The psychiatrists got together.
[03:01:55.576 --> 03:01:58.458]  And the thing is, they do it to people as you say.
[03:01:58.458 --> 03:02:07.943]  If they can do it to you, think of the poor guy who just doesn't want to do his homework or who isn't getting along with his teacher or something.
[03:02:07.943 --> 03:02:13.006]  This is a symbiotic relationship between psychiatry.
[03:02:13.006 --> 03:02:17.329]  As you say, it's a parasitical system.
[03:02:17.329 --> 03:02:20.010]  It's like the military-industrial complex.
[03:02:20.010 --> 03:02:21.031]  It needs diseases.
[03:02:21.391 --> 03:02:35.557]  Now, what Bob Whitaker, who wrote a book, has shown now, you look at all the statistics, and in fact, so-called schizophrenics and bipolars are much, much, much more likely to get better and recover if they don't take the drugs!
[03:02:35.557 --> 03:02:38.438]  Now, I'm not saying, let me give a warning here now.
[03:02:38.438 --> 03:02:42.099]  Please, you know, anyone listening to me, do not get off these drugs.
[03:02:42.099 --> 03:02:44.080]  Don't just flush them down the toilet.
[03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:47.962]  They are highly addictive drugs, and you must get off them slowly.
[03:02:48.502 --> 03:02:58.829]  But the point is, what you see is that people who are on these drugs after the so-called anti-psychotics for 10, after 2, 3, 4, 5 years, they're no longer functioning.
[03:02:58.829 --> 03:03:00.791]  It turns them into zombies.
[03:03:00.791 --> 03:03:13.659]  And we find that the people who have made a full recovery, and this is without even the best of treatment, when we have the best of treatment like we had in Soteria House and some of these other places, then they get better.
[03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:20.625]  My first client in New York, when I came back after my PhD, was labeled schizophrenic.
[03:03:20.625 --> 03:03:23.567]  I got in a battle with his mother.
[03:03:23.567 --> 03:03:28.711]  She was calling up the clinic, wanted to get me fired, because I told him, John, you don't need these drugs.
[03:03:28.711 --> 03:03:31.253]  And what happened to him, Alex?
[03:03:31.253 --> 03:03:34.496]  I didn't know what happened to him, because I got fired from the clinic for
[03:03:34.816 --> 03:03:36.717]  Encouraging people to get off the drugs.
[03:03:36.717 --> 03:03:38.338]  Ten years later, he called me.
[03:03:38.338 --> 03:03:42.081]  This is a guy that everybody said was schizophrenic for seven years.
[03:03:42.081 --> 03:03:43.042]  And he's not alone.
[03:03:43.042 --> 03:03:46.204]  There are many people like him today.
[03:03:46.204 --> 03:03:51.167]  And he got off the drugs slowly, or maybe a little too quick, then it was hard.
[03:03:51.167 --> 03:03:54.189]  But he'd been off the drugs for ten years and his parents weren't talking to him.
[03:03:54.189 --> 03:03:56.170]  Well, what about a beautiful mind?
[03:03:56.170 --> 03:03:56.850]  That's a true story.
[03:03:56.850 --> 03:03:59.311]  He got to where he could handle it without drugs.
[03:04:11.656 --> 03:04:17.538]  In fact, that's a perfect example, Alex, because you see again how big money corrupts.
[03:04:17.538 --> 03:04:23.920]  Because when they made the movie, they have him saying in the movie, these new drugs were what saved me.
[03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:28.081]  Whereas he said in real life, if you read the book, he got off the drugs completely.
[03:04:28.081 --> 03:04:28.921]  He couldn't stand them.
[03:04:28.921 --> 03:04:30.182]  New drugs or old drugs.
[03:04:31.342 --> 03:04:36.626]  The psychiatric pharmaceutical complex has such power in American society today.
[03:04:36.626 --> 03:04:39.869]  No, I read that book and I noticed in the movie it was the opposite.
[03:04:39.869 --> 03:04:40.469]  Incredible.
[03:04:40.469 --> 03:04:40.769]  Wow.
[03:04:40.769 --> 03:04:42.450]  Well, very impressive info.
[03:04:42.450 --> 03:04:44.772]  Dr. Seth Farber, thank you so much for coming on with us.

[03:04:47.874 --> 03:04:48.615]  Great to meet you.
[03:04:48.615 --> 03:04:51.437]  Yeah, thank you for what you're doing for people to get them to think outside the box.
[03:04:51.437 --> 03:04:54.339]  We'll be right back, or outside the Prozac bottle.
