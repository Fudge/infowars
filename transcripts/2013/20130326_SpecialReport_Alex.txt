[00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.693]  So, United Nations Agenda 21, Sustainable Development, is the biggest public relations scam in the history of the world.
[00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.134]  But is it actually more than that?
[00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:22.416]  You thought we had 50 states.
[00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:23.856]  No.
[00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:26.618]  We have 11 megaregions.
[00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:30.099]  11 megaregions.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.922]  There is such a thing as a public use, and a domain for a public use.
[00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:39.785]  And people need to be fairly complacent when their land is taken for any public use.
[00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:44.387]  But this plan is about the common good.
[00:00:44.948 --> 00:00:48.149]  I'm out here with Rosa Corey outside the Bastrop Opera House.
[00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:49.670]  How do you think you were received?
[00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.471]  I think it went great.
[00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:52.692]  I had a terrific time.
[00:00:52.712 --> 00:00:53.412]  It was wonderful.
[00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:59.020]  There was a moment in a Q&A session where somebody said, you know, I'm in sustainable development.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.481]  I just want to help my community.
[00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:04.462]  I'm into, you know, community gardening and rainwater collection and all that.
[00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:09.964]  I was most recently elected president of this volunteer group, which is called Imagine Lockhart.
[00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:15.507]  I understand that some people are involved with getting grants, which I hate grants.
[00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:18.008]  I don't want to get grants from a federal entity.
[00:01:18.308 --> 00:01:20.989]  My question is, and also a challenge I guess, is
[00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:26.566]  Why are we making this about words and about titles?
[00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:37.488]  Why aren't we making it about the fight, which is getting the UN and the federal government and just government entities in and out of our business and letting us live freely?
[00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:39.069]  So, what was your response to that?
[00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:48.851]  Well, what I said was, that's all great, you know, that everyone wants to conserve their environment, to protect their environment, and these are very laudable goals that we have.
[00:01:49.332 --> 00:01:53.516]  But, you know, you have to ask yourself who these groups are that you're participating in.
[00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:55.257]  Who is running the group?
[00:01:55.517 --> 00:01:56.638]  Who's funding the group?
[00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:58.120]  And why do you need the group?
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.981]  Why can't you do it on your own?
[00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:00.482]  You know?
[00:02:00.782 --> 00:02:05.986]  So if it's like a neighborhood thing where you're just hanging out with your pals and putting it together yourselves, cool!
[00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:06.807]  That's excellent!
[00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:09.349]  But, you know, a lot of these groups are fronts.
[00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.051]  This is the green mask, you know?
[00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:12.232]  This is the manipulation.
[00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:13.152]  Exactly.
[00:02:13.453 --> 00:02:15.615]  Now if someone wants to know more about Agenda 21, where should they go?
[00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:27.014]  Well, of course, you're welcome to check out my website, which is democratsagainstunagenda21.com, and also postsustainabilityinstitute.org.
[00:02:27.494 --> 00:02:36.102]  And we've got lots of great information, great source information for you, and comments from people around the country, and tons of wonderful stuff there.
[00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:38.264]  All just waiting for you to check it out.
[00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:40.506]  Rosa Corey, thank you for your time.
[00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:41.287]  Hey, thank you.
[00:02:42.173 --> 00:02:47.197]  Sustainable development is about protecting future generations from things that happen now.
[00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:48.598]  And you know what?
[00:02:49.258 --> 00:02:57.945]  We're looking at something that is the most dangerous situation that you could ever be imposing on future generations, and that is sustainable development.
[00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:06.455]  The idea that what you do now is damaging to future generations is a description of Agenda 21.
[00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:12.262]  Now we all have to be working hard on this together because we're in the endgame now.
[00:03:12.643 --> 00:03:14.645]  This plan has been going on for at least 20 years.
[00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:18.588]  And all of us are being impacted by it right now.
[00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:20.489]  It's not something that's out there in the future.
[00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.750]  It's not a fiction situation.
[00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.411]  It is happening right now in your town.
[00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.633]  So you need to be able to recognize it.
[00:03:27.913 --> 00:03:32.055]  The first thing you want to do is educate yourself and educate others.
[00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:35.497]  You want to work to educate everyone around you.
[00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:36.578]  Put out flyers.
[00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:39.699]  You want to attend government meetings and speak out.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.442]  Don't be sidelined or shamed or embarrassed by the communitarian plan.
[00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:53.950]  Hi, I'm Rosa Cory, and this is my book, Behind the Green Mask.
[00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.316]  It tells you strategies on how to get out of United Nations Agenda 21, what it is, what it looks like in your town, how to fight it.
[00:04:02.616 --> 00:04:05.559]  You can get it at infowarshop.com.
