[00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:07.400]  I'm Gigi Ornette with an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:19.713]  Last week, the Texas House of Representatives passed a new bill, the Animal ID Bill, HB 2311, which puts the government one step closer to requiring RFID on every animal in the state.
[00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:23.457]  Farmers in other states are already calling it the mark of the beast.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:33.165]  The Texas state requirement will be more rigid than federal requirements, and it opens a doorway for adoption of future federal requirements, which could include every animal.
[00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:44.811]  Small farmers are already saddled with heavy regulations and fees written by large agribusiness, and this is just another pointless regulation to drive them out of business, killing competition.
[00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:49.293]  As with most laws, this has nothing to do with safety, as claimed.
[00:00:50.438 --> 00:00:54.002]  Putting a completely new spin on overreaching boundaries.
[00:00:54.823 --> 00:00:59.849]  Not only are they trying to RFID cattle, but they want to RFID our children.
[00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:04.334]  Yes, they're trying to do that through the form of badges that have RFID on them.
[00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:05.735]  They claim that it's for safety.
[00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.914]  Attendance is how public schools get funding.
[00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:12.154]  So of course they want to RFID chip the children.
[00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:19.176]  But this is also training students to never expect privacy and be good citizens of the prison planet.
[00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:26.558]  But what's the difference between RFID tags around the neck and ankle monitoring bracelets used by probation officers?
[00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:34.700]  Heather Fazio, Executive Director of Texans for Accountable Government claims that these transponders could also be used by pedophiles to track children.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:46.728]  However, anyone else with an RFID reader that you can buy online for $500 and a little bit of hacker skills to determine the protocol can track these students anywhere they go up to 140 feet.
[00:01:47.068 --> 00:01:58.596]  Now, that combined with the information that is made public through the directory information with the school, these predators can go directly to these children's houses with a radiation of 140 feet.
[00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:04.740]  They can get the identification number and they can track the student whether they're at the mall, at the library, or at home.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.102]  Some students in San Antonio have already started revolting against the new RFID requirement.
[00:02:10.482 --> 00:02:14.643]  The government's solution was to expel students that wouldn't assimilate to their ways.
[00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:17.764]  So, the gears of the new world order are turning.
[00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:19.784]  Who's watching your children?
