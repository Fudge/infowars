[00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:21.198]  The IRS has always had a bit of a reputation, but they have really outdone themselves lately.
[00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:26.261]  If you've ever had to deal with them, you know that they tend to be bullies and they love to overstep boundaries.
[00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:31.985]  Well, not only have they recently targeted non-profit groups that are Tea Party Associated or
[00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:33.725]  We're good to go.
[00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:00.794]  All your meeting minutes.
[00:01:01.214 --> 00:01:09.878]  One organization, which was an educational group, handed out copies of the Constitution, among other books, and the IRS wanted them to write summaries of these books.
[00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:20.824]  Tom Zawitowski from the Portage County Tea Party stated, they wanted us not only to give our members, but the federal ID number of every group that is part of our organization.
[00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:26.185]  Every American should be concerned about this agency's blatant abuse of power.
[00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:30.106]  Where are our rights to our privacy?
[00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.447]  This is way worse than what Nixon did.
[00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:40.648]  And believe me, there are people in power way up high in the echelons of the government who know exactly what happened.
[00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:46.750]  And these bullies are the same bullies this IRS is going to be handling your health care.
