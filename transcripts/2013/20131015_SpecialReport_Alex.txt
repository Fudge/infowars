[00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.590]  Can I ask you what I was doing wrong?
[00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.174]  I can tell you, I can find out you can legally have a gun.
[00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:20.937]  So you can just stop anybody in the world from rudely displaying a gun?
[00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:21.278]  Yes.
[00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:23.199]  How am I rudely displaying a gun?
[00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:23.800]  I'm walking!
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.305]  My name is Jonathan Garcia, I'm with Open Carry Texas, and I'm out here today to show my support for Master Sergeant C.J.
[00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:30.725]  Grisham.
[00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:37.651]  The Master Sergeant who was unlawfully arrested and disarmed over in Temple, his trial starts today.
[00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:39.513]  How are you feeling about the proceedings so far?
[00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:42.791]  Well, it's all been procedural right now, just picking a jury.
[00:00:44.293 --> 00:00:47.497]  Again, I don't think I have anything to worry about.
[00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:53.204]  The facts are on my side and the case is going to unfold that way and I'm going to walk out of here
[00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:57.235]  A free man, and I can begin to hold the people accountable that put me through all this.
[00:00:57.655 --> 00:01:00.076]  They asked the jury who was familiar with the case.
[00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:00.816]  We've seen the video.
[00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:01.936]  About half of them stood up.
[00:01:02.116 --> 00:01:03.136]  I think it was more than half.
[00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:06.157]  I think it was like 80% of the people stood up and said they were familiar with the case.
[00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:08.918]  So do you think that's good, bad, indifferent?
[00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:10.838]  You know, it's hard to tell.
[00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:15.879]  There are a lot of people who are familiar with the case that completely believe that I'm in the wrong.
[00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:17.220]  I call them statists.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.221]  And then there are those that saw that I wasn't doing anything wrong at all.
[00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.561]  I call them constitutionalists.
[00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:26.504]  Saturday, Open Carry March at San Antonio, Line in the Sand.
[00:01:26.524 --> 00:01:27.825]  We're going to be from 10 to 1 o'clock.
[00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:32.189]  We've got over 1,000 people coming and it's going to be a great big event.
[00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.253]  All kinds of groups and organizations coming together to spread the word about Open Carry.
[00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:37.993]  So be there.
[00:01:38.093 --> 00:01:41.076]  San Antonio at the Alamo, 10 o'clock this Saturday, October 19th.
[00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:53.919]  Why is nascent iodine so important?
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.643]  Nascent iodine is so important because it goes directly to the thyroid.
[00:01:58.723 --> 00:02:04.249]  It's not bonded to a salt, which means it doesn't have to be broken down, and it's the most usable form.
[00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:05.730]  It's what the body uses.
[00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.432]  It's what the body is designed to use.
[00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:13.457]  If you have low energy levels, if you have pains, if you have thyroid problems, if you don't feel
[00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:14.956]  Up to par.
[00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:24.849]  Well, they've proven now that the fluoride and a lack of iodine causes a decreased IQ because you have all this stuff that builds up inside your system and builds up and builds up.
[00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.558]  And that's why some people, when they start taking iodine, will have what's called a Hertzheimer reaction or a detoxification reaction.
[00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:32.539]  But that's a good sign.
[00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:40.786]  That means you're detoxifying all that fluoride buildup, the mercury buildup in there, the bromine buildup in your system, and the chlorine buildup in your system.
[00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:41.746]  You don't want those things.
[00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:44.949]  All of those things have been proven as carcinogens.
[00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:51.454]  That's one of the reasons prostate cancer is on the rise too, is because prostate takes up iodine.
[00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:59.101]  And the men that are lacking iodine causes the prostate to become cystic and causes the prostate to swell and eventually leads to prostate cancer.
[00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:04.227]  There's been an extreme rise in polycystic ovarian disease, PCOS, with women.
[00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:11.114]  Fibrocystic breast disease because iodine is stored in the breast tissue, the ovaries, the prostate glands in men.
[00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:13.657]  It's utilized by every single cell in the body.
[00:03:14.158 --> 00:03:17.902]  Why does this almost taste good compared to other iodine that tastes horrible?
[00:03:18.162 --> 00:03:20.405]  That's because it's real iodine, atomic form.
[00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:25.289]  We wanted something that's gonna go straight into the bloodstream and straight into the thyroid gland.
[00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.752]  We wanted to put it in a vegetable glycerin base.
[00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:31.015]  That's a USP kosher certified vegetable glycerin base.
[00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:31.936]  And that product...
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.703]  ...is not tested on animals, it's vegan-friendly, it's gluten-free, it's GMO-free.
[00:03:39.103 --> 00:03:43.645]  Of all the things I've done, nascent iodine was just absolutely amazing.
[00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:54.550]  So we developed with Dr. Group a double-strength, low-price, InfoWarsLife.com survival shield, the Atomic Nascent Iodine, available right now.
