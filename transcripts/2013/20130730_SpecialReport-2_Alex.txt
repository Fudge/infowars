[00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:13.462]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an Info Wars news alert.
[00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:17.903]  Two Detroit police officers have been accused of roadside robbery and assault.
[00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:22.485]  The citizens were investigated and searched by both sergeants.
[00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:26.826]  It is alleged that an undisclosed amount of U.S.
[00:00:26.886 --> 00:00:29.647]  currency was taken from one of the citizens.
[00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:34.469]  Fortunately for those victims, there is a good citizen who was able to photograph the event.
[00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.030]  But what if you yourself are the only witness to police corruption?
[00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:40.354]  Donald Andrews Jr.
[00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.817]  operates a so-called smoke shop on Mohawk Avenue in Scotia.
[00:00:44.297 --> 00:00:48.240]  It sells incense and other smoking paraphernalia, legal stuff.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.225]  Scotia and Schenectady County Police became suspicious and targeted Andrews' shop, sending an undercover informant in twice.
[00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:57.947]  Donald turns, he comes in.
[00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:02.814]  Places the crack on the counter.
[00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:10.162]  Bear in mind, it's informants like that who are being used in the city of Chicago and other areas to snitch on private gun owners.
[00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:20.492]  And if you'd like to learn more on how to watch the Watchmen, go to InfoWarsShop.com and pick up Breakthrough, investigative journalist James O'Keefe's account on how to expose fraud.
