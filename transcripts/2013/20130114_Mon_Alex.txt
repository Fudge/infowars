[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.772]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.772 --> 00:00:11.372]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.372 --> 00:00:12.913]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:17.095]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:21.198]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:42.961]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the 14th day of January 2013.
[00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:48.363]  We're going to be here live, Lord willing, for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:50.985]  And again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:54.927]  We do not have any guests today except for the Obama phone lady.
[00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:59.177]  And she is going to be in studio with us.
[00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:00.618]  She is here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:10.602]  If you go up to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, you can see there that it says, Obama phone lady comes to Texas.
[00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:18.306]  And this is amazing because she's one of the most virally viewed and downloaded videos ever.
[00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:22.808]  And it's not just that what she's saying is ridiculous about, you know, free handouts from the government.
[00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.072]  I know she's listening right now.
[00:01:25.072 --> 00:01:26.813]  She's a very sweet lady.
[00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:28.715]  It's that she's very funny.
[00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:34.279]  And she's exactly what I thought she would be like when she flew in last night at about 6.30.
[00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:36.601]  Her plane was late.
[00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:40.745]  Flew in out of Cleveland via Houston and then to Austin, Texas.
[00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:43.407]  And her husband is exactly what I imagined him to be like.
[00:01:43.407 --> 00:01:49.852]  Just really nice, funny, smart people.
[00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:53.415]  Except childlike when it comes to trusting government.
[00:01:55.274 --> 00:02:13.004]  And she's just as funny and just as charming in person as she is in that video that's only about a minute long where she talks about you on social security, food stamps, you know, you get Obama phone.
[00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.086]  Everybody in Cleveland got Obama phone.
[00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:19.528]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we took her and her husband out to dinner last night.
[00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.532]  And has had a great evening with them.
[00:02:22.532 --> 00:02:25.715]  And quite frankly, I haven't really hardly seen my children the last few days.
[00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:27.196]  I've been working so much over the weekend.
[00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:30.820]  And I want to go home and see them tonight.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.082]  But I also want to take Obama phone lady out to dinner.
[00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:35.004]  You know what I'll do?
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.906]  I'll have my wife come meet us for dinner.
[00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:40.869]  And we'll take Obama phone lady and her husband.
[00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:45.013]  And we're going to tell you her name and everything here on air.
[00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:47.957]  In fact, we don't know who Obama Phone Lady is.
[00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:49.338]  Let's go ahead and cue that up with audio.
[00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:51.941]  Can we cue that up and play the audio here in a moment?
[00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:51.981]  So...
[00:03:11.653 --> 00:03:16.617]  People are asking, why have you got an Obama phone lady here?
[00:03:16.617 --> 00:03:24.044]  Well, number one, I said to listeners there'd be a $5,000 bounty for whoever got me a hold of her.
[00:03:24.044 --> 00:03:26.285]  That's some good English there.
[00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:32.731]  That there would be a $5,000 bonus for whoever got us in touch with her, and then if we actually got her on air.
[00:03:32.731 --> 00:03:34.833]  $5,000 bounty.
[00:03:38.704 --> 00:03:48.126]  And I got to talk to the guys that actually ran into her at a store and did this, and obviously asked them if they want any of that bounty to go to her.
[00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:52.866]  But we flew her down here, and she is here.
[00:03:52.866 --> 00:04:01.248]  And so in about an hour and a half from now, if we cover news and take your calls, we will have Obama phone lady here.
[00:04:01.248 --> 00:04:07.529]  And you notice last night when I picked her up, the video is up on Infowars.com, that I wore a sports jacket.
[00:04:08.404 --> 00:04:15.945]  And you notice I'm wearing one now, because I've got butterflies, this is a big deal around here, and I'm not joking.
[00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:18.546]  It's like the eagle has landed.
[00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:21.306]  This is the kind of stuff we get excited about.
[00:04:21.306 --> 00:04:27.047]  I was not even excited about going on Piers Morgan, didn't even have butterflies, didn't wear a sports jacket.
[00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:29.428]  For Obama phone lady, I think I ought to go put a tie on.
[00:04:29.428 --> 00:04:31.748]  I ought to put some diamond cufflinks on.
[00:04:31.748 --> 00:04:34.909]  In fact, I'm wearing a short-sleeved shirt, that's not respectful enough.
[00:04:35.677 --> 00:04:37.498]  That's actually all I had back there in my wardrobe.
[00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:39.298]  I sent stuff away to be cleaned.
[00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:43.600]  Okay, uh... Just... She's coming.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.201]  May even get her husband in here with her.
[00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:50.203]  He's a character too, but uh... It's a big deal.
[00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:54.945]  And I'm telling you, this woman could be ready for stand-up comedy on HBO right now.
[00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:57.966]  So, who wants to manage her out there is the big question.
[00:04:57.966 --> 00:04:59.467]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:59.467 --> 00:04:59.927]  Stay with us.

[00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:14.208]  Shame on you.
[00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:16.530]  If you fool me, you can't get fooled again.

[00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:38.617]  A man's got to have a code, a creed to live by.
[00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:39.437]  John Wayne.
[00:08:40.772 --> 00:08:57.381]  And I tip my hat and take a toast of coffee to John Wayne from my John Wayne coffee cup that I bought at his favorite place in the world, Monument Valley, Utah, where he shot so many of his first Westerns.
[00:08:57.381 --> 00:08:57.622]  Mmm.
[00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:00.511]  Absolutely delicious.
[00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:08.377]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday edition worldwide broadcast, the 14th day of January 2013.
[00:09:08.377 --> 00:09:09.238]  Wow!
[00:09:09.238 --> 00:09:14.122]  Where to begin?
[00:09:14.122 --> 00:09:15.223]  Where to start?
[00:09:15.223 --> 00:09:16.224]  If you just tuned in,
[00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:25.674]  To the broadcast, coming up in the flesh, and I'm still pinching myself that this isn't a dream.
[00:09:25.674 --> 00:09:36.842]  People on the YouTube video that we posted late last night, that Rob Dew and John Bound did a great job getting up, even though we didn't get back from dinner with Obama Phone Lady until about 9.30.
[00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:45.668]  They stayed up late to edit down our picking her up at the airport and taking her out to dinner, and some of the enjoyable antics that took place there.
[00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:54.330]  Don't worry, there'll be full behind-the-scenes videos in the days to come, and she's going to be in studio today with us on the radio show.
[00:09:54.330 --> 00:10:00.491]  And then I think I'm going to take her out around Austin today as well and shoot some more footage with her.
[00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:07.272]  And a lot of people are obviously freaking out, saying it's like reality is folding in on itself.
[00:10:07.272 --> 00:10:11.533]  She goes out and talks about Obama, gave us a phone, he's going to do more.
[00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:15.592]  Everybody in Cleveland got Obama phone.
[00:10:15.592 --> 00:10:28.964]  And it's not just that the video is obviously ridiculous, the dependency, and the idea that government's there to give us freebies, but that she does have an electric personality.
[00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:40.385]  And, you know, I think this could be a story of somebody who literally takes that flash in the pan, 15 minutes of fame, and turns it into something bigger.
[00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:50.328]  I see her as kind of a Sam Kennison style comic, because she's very funny in person, very witty, but again, also tough love here.
[00:10:50.328 --> 00:10:51.309]  I told her this last night.
[00:10:52.489 --> 00:10:56.971]  She's like, well, my son says you're a Republican, you're a big conservative, you know, you're pro-gun and stuff.
[00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:59.532]  I don't really have the internet, so I don't know.
[00:10:59.532 --> 00:11:09.016]  And, you know, I came anyways because so many people, you know, after they heard I was coming on or was thinking about coming on, said, oh yeah, you got to go on the Alex Jones Show in her community.
[00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:11.337]  And a lot of folks she, you know, knows said that I was a good guy.
[00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.290]  And I was honest with her.
[00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:26.734]  I said, look, it's ridiculous that you want a free phone from the president and that that's your idea of, you know, winning somehow when they take your whole future away with dependency and then basically give us baubles.
[00:11:26.734 --> 00:11:31.955]  It's like a free toy and a happy meal.
[00:11:31.955 --> 00:11:38.397]  But the fact from a sociological perspective or a psychological perspective,
[00:11:39.618 --> 00:11:55.047]  As a sociologist or as someone studying culture, that she is kind of the archetypal person who really thinks the government cares about her and wants to help her get a leg up.
[00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:57.988]  There have been some people in government that have tried to help folks.
[00:11:57.988 --> 00:12:00.670]  There have been good people that have worked through government to help people.
[00:12:01.644 --> 00:12:10.972]  But the controlling driving force of government is domestication, enslavement, and cultural destruction.
[00:12:10.972 --> 00:12:18.398]  And no one can argue with the numbers of what welfare and big government has done, not just to the black community, but communities across the board.
[00:12:18.398 --> 00:12:19.879]  And so it is my hope
[00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:48.365]  And I'll just be honest with you here about this, is that it is my hope to stay in contact with Obama phone lady, and we'll give you her full name and stuff on air once she joins us, and to try to basically maybe even have her as an auxiliary reporter, I haven't even told her this yet, I'm just saying it all on air, and to try to educate her and inform her
[00:12:49.584 --> 00:12:54.170]  about how we're all being inserted into a matrix like prison.
[00:12:54.170 --> 00:13:00.818]  So I want to reach down to the matrix like Morpheus to her, Neo, because as Eric Blair, a.k.a.
[00:13:00.818 --> 00:13:09.168]  George Orwell said, if there is any hope, and will you guys print me Orwell quotes, I'm going to do that, Orwell quotes on the only hope lies with the proles.
[00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:29.460]  And even though I don't subscribe to the communist ideology, the globalists are using communism as a template of control, and it's the general public, George Orwell talked about, he actually wrote non-fiction books on this subject, that obsess over lottery tickets, or get-rich-quick schemes, or a hope and a prayer.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:34.744]  That, you know, just if Obama gets in there, he's going to fix everything because the president can get it done.
[00:13:34.744 --> 00:13:38.186]  And this woman really hopes that he's going to turn the economy around.
[00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:39.727]  This woman works for, you know, $8 an hour.
[00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:44.665]  And can't live on that, and I don't blame her!
[00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:46.228]  In Cleveland.
[00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:49.953]  She goes and cleans houses all day for $8 an hour.
[00:13:49.953 --> 00:13:52.957]  No one could live on that.
[00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.101]  And they take taxes out of it.
[00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:56.382]  And she didn't even understand that.
[00:13:57.492 --> 00:14:01.334]  She didn't even understand why her paycheck's getting smaller with the payroll taxes.
[00:14:01.334 --> 00:14:03.035]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[00:14:03.035 --> 00:14:09.478]  My wife and other people in my family, when they heard that she was coming to town last week, they said, listen, Alex, you're mean.
[00:14:09.478 --> 00:14:11.519]  You know, you don't get her on your show and make fun of her.
[00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:13.800]  And I said, what do you think, I'm an idiot?
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.401]  I don't want to make fun of her.
[00:14:15.401 --> 00:14:20.203]  Sure, it's funny at one level, but my... and she knows it's funny.
[00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:31.779]  My goal is to actually show this lady who's actually an interesting human being and has a lot of spirit, a lot of heart, a lot of guts, who's got real potential.
[00:14:31.779 --> 00:14:38.267]  I guarantee you, ladies and gentlemen, you take somebody like that lady and you put her on the frontier, you put her in adversity.
[00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:51.217]  You give her real opportunities to have a future and to build a better world and to not be dumbed down by the television and this sick culture, she would be an unbelievably powerful individual.
[00:14:51.217 --> 00:14:53.498]  I can see the potential there.
[00:14:53.498 --> 00:15:02.801]  And that's what makes me so bad about the collectivist, is that they know human potential and they want to shutter it, they want to shut it down.
[00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:05.422]  While telling us big government is about
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:12.702]  Getting Obama Phone Lady to her highest potential.
[00:15:12.702 --> 00:15:16.023]  And that is not the case.
[00:15:16.023 --> 00:15:22.245]  And if you don't know who Obama Phone Lady is, can we cue that up one more time?
[00:15:22.245 --> 00:15:25.246]  She's the lady who was one of the most viral videos last year.
[00:15:25.246 --> 00:15:26.026]  I mean, it's been seen.
[00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:27.246]  Let's be conservative.
[00:15:27.246 --> 00:15:31.608]  There's probably 50 million views in one form or another out there, 8 million here, 5 million there.
[00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:33.601]  By the way,
[00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:09.214]  I put a $5,000 bounty out to find her, and I was surprised because we have listeners in every city.
[00:16:09.214 --> 00:16:23.925]  We're on a couple stations in Ohio, a lot of listeners in Cleveland, and no one could find her until a listener ran into her in a store months and months later.
[00:16:23.925 --> 00:16:24.446]  And guess what?
[00:16:24.446 --> 00:16:28.289]  The Democratic Party took her, same amount of money.
[00:16:28.289 --> 00:16:29.910]  She was working, you know, paid canvasser.
[00:16:31.789 --> 00:16:33.869]  So we now know that.
[00:16:33.869 --> 00:16:36.930]  And they stuck her at a desk job and told her, stay out of the public eye.
[00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:44.471]  And they lied to her and said, because you're just too effective.
[00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:45.952]  See, I'm not going to lie to this lady.
[00:16:45.952 --> 00:16:47.632]  I told her, it's hilarious what you did.
[00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:51.353]  I don't agree with the dependency.
[00:16:51.353 --> 00:16:57.554]  I think if you play your cards right, and if you go to some small-time comedy clubs and get under the right person's wing,
[00:16:58.732 --> 00:17:02.575]  You can develop comedy pieces and probably become very famous.
[00:17:02.575 --> 00:17:05.416]  She's got natural talent.
[00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:07.898]  And there's nothing I'd like better.
[00:17:07.898 --> 00:17:09.339]  By the way, I didn't tell her this to get her here.
[00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.361]  I told her this once I was with her in person, but I told her it'll take hard work.
[00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:14.742]  She's not going to go right to the top immediately.
[00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.623]  She's funny.
[00:17:16.623 --> 00:17:21.246]  And my instinct about her, she's exactly what I thought she'd be like.
[00:17:21.246 --> 00:17:25.569]  Exactly what I thought she would be like.
[00:17:28.579 --> 00:17:31.982]  And her husband was exactly what I thought they'd be like.
[00:17:31.982 --> 00:17:33.924]  And just really funny, interesting people.
[00:17:35.383 --> 00:17:41.866]  Uh, who are, again, smart at many levels, but also still buy into the fake dream.
[00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:43.346]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:17:43.346 --> 00:17:48.228]  The fake dream of, oh, you go to a casino, you're going to get rich.
[00:17:48.228 --> 00:17:50.449]  Oh, you buy a lottery ticket, you're going to win.
[00:17:50.449 --> 00:17:53.611]  Oh, you get Obama in, all the problems are going to be fixed.
[00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:55.911]  And I was sitting there talking to her last night.
[00:17:55.911 --> 00:17:57.092]  I know she's listening.
[00:17:57.092 --> 00:17:58.853]  I should just leave it all, let it be fresh when she gets here.
[00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.611]  She's like, man, you know, I voted for him, voted for him twice.
[00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:03.631]  Things gotta get better.
[00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:06.551]  Obama's gonna get in trouble if things don't get better.
[00:18:06.551 --> 00:18:08.492]  Honey, things aren't gonna get better.
[00:18:08.492 --> 00:18:12.693]  This is Agenda 21 designed to destroy you.
[00:18:12.693 --> 00:18:16.494]  They don't bring in 30 million illegal aliens so you've got a future.
[00:18:16.494 --> 00:18:17.914]  And they don't bring them in so they get a future.
[00:18:17.914 --> 00:18:22.855]  They bring them in to drive down the wages and make us poor as a political tool of control.
[00:18:28.437 --> 00:18:33.319]  They also understood that, well, Obama, you know, like Nixon, he can just pump some money out there.
[00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:35.880]  They understood Obama's got the printing press to turn up on high.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.561]  And I said, have you noticed prices have gone up?
[00:18:39.561 --> 00:18:42.842]  Notice the packages of potato chips and ice cream have gotten smaller.
[00:18:42.842 --> 00:18:49.705]  Have you noticed that in almost every area, things are going up and up and up in price?
[00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:51.005]  They're like, yeah, we have noticed that.
[00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:52.866]  We just can't pay our bills.
[00:18:52.866 --> 00:18:54.947]  Her husband works as a plumber 12 hours a day.
[00:18:58.058 --> 00:19:04.343]  She works as a maid for $8 an hour.
[00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:07.126]  And again, no one's ever taught her anything entrepreneurial.
[00:19:07.126 --> 00:19:14.312]  No one has explained to her that the maid service she contracts through, I bet money, is getting $20, $25 an hour for.
[00:19:14.312 --> 00:19:20.377]  That all she's got to do is go hang up signs all around the area that she wants to target
[00:19:21.624 --> 00:19:29.089]  Saying she'll come clean houses and she'd get all that clientele for herself and double or triple her money just like that with pieces of paper hung up on the wall.
[00:19:29.089 --> 00:19:32.851]  No one is teaching these people anything.
[00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:34.892]  They don't teach any of that in school.
[00:19:34.892 --> 00:19:39.696]  They don't want you to know that.
[00:19:39.696 --> 00:19:44.639]  Anyways, it's going to be a study of can we
[00:19:47.048 --> 00:19:48.269]  Help somebody.
[00:19:48.269 --> 00:19:53.394]  But it's not like, you know, the Eddie Murphy movie where they make a bet that they can't help somebody.
[00:19:53.394 --> 00:19:59.359]  I know that we can probably try to help this lady and help others by her example.
[00:19:59.359 --> 00:19:59.999]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:00.360]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.847 --> 00:20:06.829]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[00:20:06.829 --> 00:20:14.352]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[00:20:14.352 --> 00:20:17.033]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:23.636]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[00:20:23.636 --> 00:20:24.777]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:34.062]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[00:20:34.062 --> 00:20:38.045]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[00:20:38.045 --> 00:20:39.886]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.
[00:20:40.106 --> 00:20:42.408]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:07.406]  Weakened by GMOs, stressed out about money, and blasted by the electric environment.
[00:21:07.406 --> 00:21:11.707]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[00:21:11.707 --> 00:21:13.887]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[00:21:13.887 --> 00:21:25.549]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other tissues behave.
[00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:30.270]  I learned I don't have to put up with disease, decay, or decline like I'd been conditioned to believe.
[00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.830]  I began taking RNA drops
[00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:38.234]  A 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy.

[00:22:32.997 --> 00:22:37.560]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:43.364]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:43.364 --> 00:22:47.006]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:47.006 --> 00:22:49.728]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.728 --> 00:22:54.791]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:05.339]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:08.701]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:11.703]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[00:23:11.703 --> 00:23:22.631]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:23.772]  Then there's affordability.
[00:23:23.772 --> 00:23:28.695]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, even
[00:23:28.695 --> 00:23:29.115]  I think so.
[00:23:51.061 --> 00:23:56.304]  That's 877-99BERKEY or visit bigberkeywaterfilters.com.

[00:23:58.346 --> 00:24:00.948]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[00:24:00.948 --> 00:24:17.038]  We're going to get into the news and open the phones up here in a moment.
[00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:19.039]  But first, here's from page 60.
[00:24:22.634 --> 00:24:28.844]  Of 1984, written by George Orwell, if there was hope, it must lie with the proles.
[00:24:28.844 --> 00:24:31.609]  That's the common working class.
[00:24:31.609 --> 00:24:33.532]  Because only there, in those swarming
[00:24:34.642 --> 00:24:45.704]  Disregarded masses, 85% of the population of Oceania, that's England and the U.S., could be forced to destroy the party ever be generated.
[00:24:45.704 --> 00:24:48.005]  The party could not be overthrown from within.
[00:24:48.005 --> 00:24:54.046]  Its enemies, if ever it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another.
[00:24:54.046 --> 00:25:03.888]  Even if the legendary brotherhood existed as just a possibility it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in large numbers
[00:25:04.898 --> 00:25:06.619]  And more than twos and threes.
[00:25:06.619 --> 00:25:15.384]  Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice, at the most an occasional whispered word.
[00:25:15.384 --> 00:25:22.728]  But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire.
[00:25:22.728 --> 00:25:26.670]  They need only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies.
[00:25:28.118 --> 00:25:32.465]  If they chose, they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning.
[00:25:32.465 --> 00:25:37.313]  Surely, sooner or later, it must come to them to do it.
[00:25:37.313 --> 00:25:41.060]  And yet... And he goes...
[00:25:44.301 --> 00:26:02.916]  He goes through the strength of the proles watching this grandmother out there hand washing the clothes in the slum and the strength of her sunburned face and her big muscular shoulders and the sound of children giggling, but the proles wouldn't spend their time studying how government or business worked.
[00:26:03.536 --> 00:26:20.139]  The proles obsessed all day about lottery tickets and lottery systems to win and get rich schemes and pornography and mindlessness and entertainment put out by the party.
[00:26:20.139 --> 00:26:22.340]  Big Brother didn't even need to police the proles.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.441]  They were just dumbed down and obsessed with petty garbage and didn't even exist.
[00:26:27.441 --> 00:26:28.121]  The party
[00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:33.658]  The English Socialist Party, which is really a Soviet party in the book.
[00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:52.029]  This is what George Orwell, aka real name Eric Blair, who'd worked for the communists and worked for MI6 and worked for OSS and worked as an imperial policeman before that and lived in the slums on purpose for years, contracting tuberculosis in Paris and also in London.
[00:26:53.581 --> 00:26:55.663]  Wrote a bunch of non-fiction books and essays.
[00:26:55.663 --> 00:26:56.484]  Amazing stuff.
[00:26:56.484 --> 00:27:02.469]  I've read basically all of Orwell's writings I could find in a period in my life when I was about 20.
[00:27:02.469 --> 00:27:09.435]  And I learned a lot through him not having to actually go live in a slum with people with tuberculosis.
[00:27:09.435 --> 00:27:13.079]  He came from a well-to-do kind of establishment intelligentsia family.
[00:27:16.898 --> 00:27:20.760]  And he thought communism would fight the ills he saw.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:26.703]  And then he discovered, wait a minute, fighting in the Spanish Civil War, that the communists were just as bad as the fascists.
[00:27:26.703 --> 00:27:28.544]  They were just criminals.
[00:27:28.544 --> 00:27:34.286]  Using a governmental term, a political term, as a cover.
[00:27:34.286 --> 00:27:43.471]  And then he went and worked at the BBC in propaganda, and the character Winston Smith is Eric Blair at the BBC.
[00:27:45.393 --> 00:27:47.354]  One of their top propagandists.
[00:27:47.354 --> 00:27:50.975]  Taking truths and rearranging them and smashing them.
[00:27:50.975 --> 00:27:56.017]  Then he discovers the British government is funding Hitler.
[00:27:56.017 --> 00:27:57.517]  That they funded Hitler.
[00:27:57.517 --> 00:28:00.058]  Didn't run Hitler, they helped create him.
[00:28:00.058 --> 00:28:01.359]  Helped put him in there.
[00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:04.140]  It was like a wind-up toy, like one of these mentally ill mass shooters.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:10.882]  They give government funds and have a government psychiatrist and then, oh, they go and attack.
[00:28:10.882 --> 00:28:13.263]  And the book talks about government-sponsored terror.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:22.864]  How the government itself was firing missiles into London every day, randomly, just to scare people.
[00:28:22.864 --> 00:28:41.133]  And how everything else was squalor and rack and ruin, but the giant, pyramidal-sized buildings that look like something out of Blade Runner, with black helicopters coming in and out of armored command bases, flying around, looking through your windows, your television screens, watching and listening to you, that is now a reality.
[00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:45.559]  They just haven't gone to the physical end of it yet.
[00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:47.819]  And here's the good news, they are in check.
[00:28:47.819 --> 00:28:55.702]  And if you know chess, that means we've got them, we're close to fire, we're close to beat them.
[00:28:55.702 --> 00:29:01.103]  Because the average gun shows out there are reporting 10,000 people visiting them.
[00:29:01.103 --> 00:29:05.465]  Organizers shocked as 10,000 attend gun show.
[00:29:05.465 --> 00:29:10.226]  Piers Morgan is now chickened out of a debate he called for, part two, round two.
[00:29:12.791 --> 00:29:17.494]  Senator Schumer is saying they'll just use executive power to basically lean on.
[00:29:17.494 --> 00:29:18.594]  This is what they've already said they do.
[00:29:18.594 --> 00:29:20.215]  That's why we told you this was coming.
[00:29:20.215 --> 00:29:31.702]  Executive orders, rulemaking, and just tell Walmart and others not to sell semi-autos and have the ATF come in and basically nickel and dime them and white glove inspect them until they do it.
[00:29:31.702 --> 00:29:33.543]  You're saying, well, how do we have them in check?
[00:29:33.543 --> 00:29:34.363]  Doesn't mean we've won.
[00:29:34.363 --> 00:29:35.564]  They've still got some moves.
[00:29:35.564 --> 00:29:36.685]  But I mean, we're up against them.
[00:29:36.685 --> 00:29:39.026]  We're right on their tail.
[00:29:39.026 --> 00:29:39.986]  They're not on our tail.
[00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:40.747]  We're on their tail.
[00:29:41.943 --> 00:29:46.105]  When we come back, I'll explain to you why and go over some news and then take your calls.
[00:29:46.105 --> 00:29:52.029]  But coming up at the bottom of the next hour, one hour away, you will be transmitted.
[00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:53.430]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.750]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.951]  To Obama-phone heaven.
[00:29:55.951 --> 00:29:58.633]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.611 --> 00:30:06.615]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[00:30:06.615 --> 00:30:14.124]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[00:30:14.124 --> 00:30:16.826]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[00:30:16.826 --> 00:30:23.434]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[00:30:23.434 --> 00:30:24.555]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[00:30:24.835 --> 00:30:33.866]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:37.831]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[00:30:37.831 --> 00:30:39.693]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.
[00:30:39.893 --> 00:30:42.174]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:08.942]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:16.633]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[00:31:16.633 --> 00:31:27.579]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:31.721]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[00:31:31.721 --> 00:31:37.904]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:31:38.644 --> 00:31:49.889]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.
[00:31:49.889 --> 00:31:58.653]  Visit www.SilverLungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver based products are best for you.
[00:31:58.653 --> 00:32:02.114]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:32:02.114 --> 00:32:05.436]  Sick of the globalist eugenics control freaks adding poison to your water?
[00:32:05.796 --> 00:32:07.617]  Laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:32:07.617 --> 00:32:10.038]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:32:10.038 --> 00:32:19.143]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at Infowars.com.
[00:32:19.143 --> 00:32:22.585]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:32:22.585 --> 00:32:24.266]  There's no priming required.
[00:32:24.266 --> 00:32:26.547]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:32:26.547 --> 00:32:28.968]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to
[00:32:29.528 --> 00:32:29.808]  95%.
[00:32:29.808 --> 00:32:31.628]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:32:31.628 --> 00:32:33.049]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:36.229]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:32:36.229 --> 00:32:39.610]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:43.731]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:46.471]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:32:46.471 --> 00:32:48.051]  It's what my family uses.
[00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:51.372]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:32:51.372 --> 00:32:57.193]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:32:57.193 --> 00:32:58.353]  You can also call to order.
[00:32:58.473 --> 00:32:58.513]  888-253-3139
[00:33:08.757 --> 00:33:18.740]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commons.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.621]  That's anti-government!
[00:33:19.621 --> 00:33:25.022]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:33:25.022 --> 00:33:25.943]  One man did it!
[00:33:25.943 --> 00:33:31.605]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:33:31.605 --> 00:33:34.125]  It is a big idea.
[00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:34.826]  A new world order.
[00:33:34.826 --> 00:33:35.866]  I thought that didn't exist.
[00:33:38.797 --> 00:33:41.358]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:33:41.358 --> 00:33:42.319]  It's just pancakes.
[00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:45.020]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.562]  Never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[00:33:49.562 --> 00:33:51.223]  They'll never take our guns.
[00:33:51.223 --> 00:34:00.188]  Nobody wants to confiscate them.
[00:34:00.188 --> 00:34:01.368]  And Feinstein loves us.
[00:34:01.368 --> 00:34:08.312]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:34:09.972 --> 00:34:13.933]  What about criminal governments?
[00:34:13.933 --> 00:34:15.513]  Guns will be taken.
[00:34:15.513 --> 00:34:17.214]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:34:17.214 --> 00:34:18.294]  We're going to take all of them.
[00:34:18.294 --> 00:34:21.775]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:34:21.775 --> 00:34:22.915]  Global governance at last.
[00:34:22.915 --> 00:34:23.896]  Is it one world?
[00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:25.596]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:29.157]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:34:29.157 --> 00:34:33.018]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:34:35.464 --> 00:34:41.790]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:47.435]  Yes sir, I am he and it is the 14th day of January 2013.
[00:34:47.435 --> 00:34:57.084]  And if you'd like to talk about all the incredible news taking place geopolitically, domestically, the economy.
[00:34:57.084 --> 00:35:00.948]  By the way, start sending your questions in at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[00:35:02.389 --> 00:35:10.813]  And guys, will you start printing me, or ask Christy, who helps run the Twitter account and does a great job.
[00:35:10.813 --> 00:35:16.296]  Maybe ask her to print off questions for Obama Phone Lady.
[00:35:16.296 --> 00:35:20.498]  So that when Michelle, that's her first name, so that when Michelle
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:36.187]  is in here in about an hour from now we can also have some of your questions for Obama phone lady who we've flown down to Austin, Texas to really have the archetypal Obama supporter here in studio with us.
[00:35:36.187 --> 00:35:45.051]  And by the way, we've had archetypal Bush supporters on before who thought it was conservative to get rid of the Bill of Rights and were pro-torture.
[00:35:45.051 --> 00:35:48.052]  So they're just as nonsensical sometimes as well.
[00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:55.247]  So we look forward to having her here, you know, just because we hope to try to be able to change her mind.
[00:35:55.247 --> 00:35:58.170]  And it doesn't mean we want her to go support Romney.
[00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.593]  Thereby, no, Romney sucks!
[00:36:00.593 --> 00:36:01.854]  To quote Obama phone lady.
[00:36:02.645 --> 00:36:07.166]  The point is that it was a rigged game, so that is coming up if you just joined us.
[00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:08.826]  Yes, you heard me right.
[00:36:08.826 --> 00:36:09.646]  This is not a joke.
[00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:17.408]  The video of her arriving to Austin via aircraft is up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:20.849]  In fact, have we tweeted ObamaPhoneLady videos out?
[00:36:20.849 --> 00:36:22.189]  I don't think I've even done that.
[00:36:22.189 --> 00:36:23.949]  Will you guys tweet that out for me?
[00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:26.310]  It's hard for me to walk and chew gum.
[00:36:28.038 --> 00:36:29.418]  I've come here to do two things.
[00:36:29.418 --> 00:36:35.721]  One thing is to kick butt, and the other thing is to chew bubblegum, and I'm all out of bubblegum, to quote, to paraphrase Rowdy Piper.
[00:36:35.721 --> 00:36:36.961]  Okay, I'm being silly.
[00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:41.823]  The point is, I want to send out a tweet that Obama phone lady discovered.
[00:36:41.823 --> 00:36:45.524]  Obama phone lady's identity discovered.
[00:36:45.524 --> 00:36:46.444]  It's got a dictation.
[00:36:46.444 --> 00:36:48.145]  I'm dictating the tweet there.
[00:36:48.145 --> 00:36:54.107]  Okay, you can tell I'm excited about this, even though we've got a lot of bad news and some good news here that we're going to be going over.
[00:36:54.107 --> 00:36:54.567]  By the way,
[00:36:55.706 --> 00:36:57.868]  This shirt sold out.
[00:36:57.868 --> 00:36:59.489]  This shirt sold out.
[00:36:59.489 --> 00:37:07.657]  But they had a feeling it was going to sell out, and so there is a truck coming, but tomorrow, with more of these.
[00:37:07.657 --> 00:37:10.559]  So, you'll basically should be able to get it by next week.
[00:37:10.559 --> 00:37:12.341]  Get your order in now.
[00:37:12.341 --> 00:37:14.142]  We've never had a t-shirt sell like this.
[00:37:14.142 --> 00:37:20.067]  It is a come and take it AK-47 with the Texas come and take it, Texas Revolutionary War.
[00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:28.547]  It says come and take it and inside of the AK-47 is the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:37:30.222 --> 00:37:34.923]  And then it says InfoWars.com handsomely on the back.
[00:37:34.923 --> 00:37:37.584]  And we've got women asking for a woman's design.
[00:37:37.584 --> 00:37:39.164]  That'll take some time.
[00:37:39.164 --> 00:37:41.325]  But, you know, we've got smalls for women.
[00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:45.206]  But yes, we're going to come out with some shirts for women.
[00:37:45.206 --> 00:37:46.726]  I get requested that on the street all the time.
[00:37:46.726 --> 00:37:48.026]  I never tell my folks.
[00:37:48.026 --> 00:37:50.207]  We've got to come out with women's shirts.
[00:37:51.107 --> 00:37:55.276]  You know, with the same messages, but that are more contour form-fitting.
[00:37:55.276 --> 00:38:00.005]  My wife has said this, and so we've got to do it.
[00:38:00.005 --> 00:38:02.090]  So there, I'm multitasking here on air.
[00:38:03.428 --> 00:38:05.790]  If you want the Come and Take It shirt, get your order in now.
[00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:12.695]  And of course, we also have the second best-selling Victory or Death with the rattlesnake on it.
[00:38:12.695 --> 00:38:13.436]  Very powerful.
[00:38:13.436 --> 00:38:16.899]  We also have a camouflage one of those, not just the black-on-red one.
[00:38:16.899 --> 00:38:20.021]  It's all up at infowarestore.com.
[00:38:20.021 --> 00:38:25.966]  And your purchase of the books, the videos, the t-shirts, all of it makes this broadcast possible.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.301]  So they're all up there on the site right now.
[00:38:31.301 --> 00:38:33.522]  Be sure and get it today.
[00:38:33.522 --> 00:38:36.104]  And again, continue to spread the word about the transmission.
[00:38:36.104 --> 00:38:40.586]  I'm certainly risking my life, my treasure, my name, everything else in this fight.
[00:38:40.586 --> 00:38:42.767]  So I'm not saying the least you can do.
[00:38:42.767 --> 00:38:44.147]  We appreciate your support.
[00:38:44.147 --> 00:38:45.748]  And the point is, this isn't a game.
[00:38:45.748 --> 00:38:47.429]  We shouldn't take this platform for granted.
[00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:50.410]  That's why I'm working so much harder than I ever have.
[00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.711]  Because we've got to make hay while the sun shines.
[00:38:52.711 --> 00:38:56.033]  We've got to engage the globalists while we still have a lot of freedom left.
[00:38:56.733 --> 00:39:03.855]  Now, I told you before we went to break that... Oh, people are always saying, you never give the number or the address out.
[00:39:03.855 --> 00:39:04.155]  You're right.
[00:39:04.155 --> 00:39:06.276]  Not everybody's on the internet or wants to order via the internet.
[00:39:06.276 --> 00:39:10.658]  You can call and order any t-shirts or ProPure water filters discounted with promo code WATER.
[00:39:10.658 --> 00:39:11.018]  All of it.
[00:39:11.018 --> 00:39:11.418]  888-253-3139.
[00:39:11.418 --> 00:39:11.458]  888-253-3139.
[00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:20.041]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9 and you can also write to us here at P.O.
[00:39:20.041 --> 00:39:21.081]  Box 1-9-5-4-9 Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:39:21.081 --> 00:39:21.441]  P.O.
[00:39:21.441 --> 00:39:22.602]  Box 1-9-5-4-9 Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:39:22.602 --> 00:39:25.103]  I give that out so rarely that I don't even have it memorized.
[00:39:25.103 --> 00:39:25.223]  So P.O.
[00:39:25.223 --> 00:39:26.543]  Box 1-9-5-4-9 Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:39:26.543 --> 00:39:29.084]  And we've had that address now for about six years.
[00:39:29.084 --> 00:39:30.304]  So that'll give you an idea.
[00:39:42.059 --> 00:39:45.541]  A lot of survival stuff, the best quality stuff out there.
[00:39:45.541 --> 00:39:54.788]  We've got the very best essential oil systems put out by our friends over at Interfood.
[00:39:54.788 --> 00:39:57.310]  We've got the Army Ranger style black caps.
[00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.391]  It's come to the Oathkeeper style.
[00:39:59.391 --> 00:40:00.272]  Infowars.com.
[00:40:00.272 --> 00:40:01.052]  Okay, I'm done plugging.
[00:40:01.052 --> 00:40:02.993]  I just haven't been plugging much the last month.
[00:40:02.993 --> 00:40:07.276]  I've been so focused on defending the Second Amendment that I haven't even been
[00:40:08.417 --> 00:40:09.138]  We're good to go.
[00:40:31.502 --> 00:40:38.129]  How dare us, how dare us, how dare us pay our own way promoting high quality products at great prices.
[00:40:38.129 --> 00:40:40.251]  It's just, it's totally immoral.
[00:40:40.251 --> 00:40:45.656]  And that's what they always say at CNN, you name it.
[00:40:45.656 --> 00:40:46.637]  They always say the same thing.
[00:40:46.637 --> 00:40:47.438]  They say, I'm evil.
[00:40:49.176 --> 00:40:53.318]  And every time the national media comes to interview me, they go, how dare you make money?
[00:40:53.318 --> 00:40:54.539]  This is a pretty big operation.
[00:40:54.539 --> 00:40:55.599]  You've got a lot of crew members.
[00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:57.240]  You've got a lot of equipment here.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:57.940]  You're making money.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.581]  That's bad.
[00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:01.622]  I'm like, well, did you fly here first class?
[00:41:01.622 --> 00:41:03.663]  You did, didn't you?
[00:41:03.663 --> 00:41:05.284]  You're in New York, aren't you?
[00:41:05.284 --> 00:41:06.225]  How much you paid a year?
[00:41:06.225 --> 00:41:07.745]  Oh, a million dollars.
[00:41:07.745 --> 00:41:08.986]  Right off the teleprompter.
[00:41:08.986 --> 00:41:11.747]  You're here lecturing me.
[00:41:11.747 --> 00:41:12.568]  Anyway, side issue.
[00:41:13.459 --> 00:41:16.262]  Just amazing how they play these mind games with us.
[00:41:16.262 --> 00:41:18.784]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[00:41:18.784 --> 00:41:18.964]  It's 800-259-9231.
[00:41:18.964 --> 00:41:19.024]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:19.024 --> 00:41:20.546]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:41:20.546 --> 00:41:26.011]  Well, that high-def camera's so good you can even see the dust on top of the live-on-air light there.
[00:41:26.011 --> 00:41:26.672]  No, that's okay.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.700]  It's not your job to clean in here.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.661]  I think we do have a cleaning crew.
[00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:40.421]  I don't think they ever come in here though.
[00:41:40.421 --> 00:41:42.382]  That's because they see it as like a big studio.
[00:41:42.382 --> 00:41:45.043]  Oh my gosh.
[00:41:45.043 --> 00:41:47.703]  There's like a dead fruit fly over there or something.
[00:41:47.703 --> 00:41:49.724]  Okay.
[00:41:49.724 --> 00:41:52.425]  Where to start here?
[00:41:52.425 --> 00:41:54.685]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:54.685 --> 00:42:00.567]  On any issue you wish to discuss, I've got a couple of news items I want to hit and then we're going to your phone calls.
[00:42:00.567 --> 00:42:02.868]  And let me just show folks in the document cam.
[00:42:02.868 --> 00:42:03.448]  Hey!
[00:42:05.468 --> 00:42:08.029]  Hey guys, we've got a camera mounted in there.
[00:42:08.029 --> 00:42:09.910]  Can we punch that up for viewers?
[00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.131]  Here, come on over and say hi to folks.
[00:42:12.131 --> 00:42:14.332]  No, no, just right there in that microphone.
[00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:17.513]  Hello fans, Obama phone lady here.
[00:42:17.513 --> 00:42:19.594]  How's that audio, Genesis?
[00:42:19.594 --> 00:42:23.375]  You better open your phones in your head.
[00:42:23.375 --> 00:42:27.237]  Hey, can you give a shout out to everybody?
[00:42:27.237 --> 00:42:27.697]  Now go ahead.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.843]  I'm going to give a shout out to everybody here in Austin, Texas.
[00:42:33.843 --> 00:42:36.044]  I'm on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:36.044 --> 00:42:38.086]  I'm the Obama phone lady.
[00:42:38.086 --> 00:42:40.407]  Representing Alex Jones here today.
[00:42:40.407 --> 00:42:42.428]  And I love that guy.
[00:42:42.428 --> 00:42:46.851]  He's funny like me!
[00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:47.632]  Oh my goodness.
[00:42:47.632 --> 00:42:49.293]  You know, there's no doubt.
[00:42:49.293 --> 00:42:50.334]  And I'm not just saying this.
[00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:52.195]  You could do voiceovers immediately.
[00:42:52.195 --> 00:42:54.777]  I'm going to work on your radio station before I leave here.
[00:42:55.802 --> 00:42:57.363]  I think you might.
[00:42:57.363 --> 00:42:58.544]  Have you heard the news?
[00:42:58.544 --> 00:43:05.289]  I'm going to officially offer you on air at least an auxiliary paid job as a reporter.
[00:43:05.289 --> 00:43:06.410]  All right!
[00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.211]  Hallelujah!
[00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:08.712]  Yes!
[00:43:08.712 --> 00:43:09.152]  Thank you!
[00:43:09.152 --> 00:43:10.653]  I also want to make sure you like the terms.
[00:43:10.653 --> 00:43:13.775]  I've got to work it all out, but I'm very glad you're excited.
[00:43:13.775 --> 00:43:15.056]  I'm excited about that.
[00:43:15.056 --> 00:43:16.357]  I need a job.
[00:43:16.357 --> 00:43:17.678]  Darn that May.
[00:43:17.678 --> 00:43:19.059]  Obama, you see what you've done?
[00:43:19.059 --> 00:43:20.260]  I'm moving up in the world.
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.281]  You're going to do your job.
[00:43:21.281 --> 00:43:22.222]  I'm going to set you down.
[00:43:26.499 --> 00:43:27.592]  What do you think of the rest of the crew?
[00:43:28.669 --> 00:43:29.510]  Oh, I love the crew.
[00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.530]  You got your kids on.
[00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.172]  Anytime you can go to work and bring your kids, that's the job.
[00:43:33.172 --> 00:43:34.573]  That's what I'm trying to get to.
[00:43:34.573 --> 00:43:35.073]  That's right.
[00:43:35.073 --> 00:43:37.375]  Well, don't give out too many of our security issues.
[00:43:37.375 --> 00:43:41.137]  But yes, no, my son is, I'm just, I'm just joking.
[00:43:41.137 --> 00:43:42.418]  Jakari, what do you think of all this?
[00:43:42.418 --> 00:43:43.859]  Jakari Jackson back there.
[00:43:43.859 --> 00:43:48.282]  I mean, this is quite a quite a deal for me.
[00:43:48.282 --> 00:43:50.243]  Michelle and I have something in common.
[00:43:50.243 --> 00:43:54.266]  We just made a YouTube video and somebody liked our voice enough to give us a job.
[00:43:54.266 --> 00:43:58.369]  So I can relate to her on that.
[00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:01.230]  Thank you, Jesus.
[00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.211]  Well, he's the man.
[00:44:03.211 --> 00:44:10.633]  He's the man, but you know Obama with the man with the plan, but we're gonna see what he's gonna do, because if he don't do the right thing, I'm gonna be the woman with the plan.
[00:44:10.633 --> 00:44:13.474]  Michelle Obama and Michelle Dowry.
[00:44:13.474 --> 00:44:14.815]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:14.815 --> 00:44:16.936]  Alright, you think I'm joking.
[00:44:16.936 --> 00:44:17.476]  She's here.
[00:44:17.476 --> 00:44:19.777]  Some people still think I'm joking.
[00:44:19.777 --> 00:44:26.179]  I mean, I think everybody is more freaked out about you being here in a good way than when I've had movie stars here walking around in the halls.
[00:44:26.889 --> 00:44:28.350]  I got the blood of Jesus, baby.
[00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:29.910]  I'm here.
[00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:30.611]  Alright.
[00:44:30.611 --> 00:44:31.511]  Alright.
[00:44:31.511 --> 00:44:33.252]  We're very excited, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:33.252 --> 00:44:35.113]  She is in the house.
[00:44:35.113 --> 00:44:38.274]  I tell you, guys, why don't we get her some lunch or something?
[00:44:38.274 --> 00:44:47.218]  Or take her back in the green room because it's so exciting to have her here that I can barely even operate right now.
[00:44:47.218 --> 00:44:48.759]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:48.759 --> 00:44:52.180]  I tell you what, Michelle, run in here real quick.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.261]  Run in here real quick, Michelle.
[00:44:53.261 --> 00:44:53.941]  Come on in the studio.
[00:44:55.267 --> 00:44:58.129]  Come on, we gotta give people a taste of this right now.
[00:44:58.129 --> 00:45:00.692]  Now come on right around here.
[00:45:00.692 --> 00:45:01.112]  That's right.
[00:45:01.112 --> 00:45:02.773]  Come on right over here by my microphone.
[00:45:02.773 --> 00:45:05.035]  You're just gonna pop in for a moment.
[00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:05.776]  Okay, come on in.
[00:45:05.776 --> 00:45:07.497]  We've got the camera right over here.
[00:45:07.497 --> 00:45:08.618]  Say hi to folks right there.
[00:45:08.618 --> 00:45:10.440]  Hello, folks.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.941]  Let's go to this camera right here, guys.
[00:45:11.941 --> 00:45:12.802]  Hello, folks.
[00:45:12.802 --> 00:45:13.763]  I'm here today.
[00:45:14.631 --> 00:45:16.273]  Here she is, here talking to the mic.
[00:45:16.273 --> 00:45:17.154]  Oops, go ahead.
[00:45:17.154 --> 00:45:18.536]  I'm here today, you guys.
[00:45:18.536 --> 00:45:19.938]  I'm here in Austin, Texas.
[00:45:19.938 --> 00:45:22.321]  I'm at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:22.321 --> 00:45:23.763]  I want you guys to represent.
[00:45:23.763 --> 00:45:26.186]  I'm here, the Obama phone lady.
[00:45:26.186 --> 00:45:28.349]  I arrive, I'm ready to get it going on.
[00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:29.310]  Let's do it!
[00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.511]  Alright, we'll see you in about an hour.
[00:45:31.463 --> 00:45:32.043]  Great job.
[00:45:32.043 --> 00:45:33.884]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:33.884 --> 00:45:36.025]  That is proof of life, as they say.
[00:45:36.025 --> 00:45:37.165]  All right?
[00:45:37.165 --> 00:45:38.726]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:38.726 --> 00:45:40.446]  There she is.
[00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:45.948]  Okay, now let's shift gears into the really, really bad news.
[00:45:45.948 --> 00:45:48.869]  And again, guys, I hear another mic open now.
[00:45:48.869 --> 00:45:50.790]  Whatever's going on.
[00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.912]  Okay, got that mic shut down, because you need to get that taken care of.
[00:45:54.912 --> 00:45:56.632]  You know what I'm going to do?
[00:45:56.632 --> 00:45:57.853]  They're moving ahead right now.
[00:45:59.422 --> 00:46:03.314]  Uh, with uh, draconian moves.
[00:46:06.957 --> 00:46:10.498]  Where they're just going to tell, as I told you, gun manufacturers, you can't manufacture this.
[00:46:10.498 --> 00:46:10.959]  No law.
[00:46:10.959 --> 00:46:12.839]  They're just going to say it.
[00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:16.521]  They're moving ahead with telling shops you just can't sell guns.
[00:46:16.521 --> 00:46:18.021]  And Chuckie Schumer has announced that.
[00:46:18.021 --> 00:46:21.843]  The article is up at Infowars.com.
[00:46:21.843 --> 00:46:24.004]  New York has a tentative deal on gun control.
[00:46:24.004 --> 00:46:26.345]  They're just going to throw anybody they want in the nut house.
[00:46:26.345 --> 00:46:27.345]  No judge, no jury.
[00:46:27.345 --> 00:46:28.846]  You're just going to the nut house.
[00:46:28.846 --> 00:46:31.827]  And Rahm Emanuel is announcing in the Washington Post what he said years ago.
[00:46:31.827 --> 00:46:33.728]  They'll just put you on a no-gun-buy list.
[00:46:33.728 --> 00:46:34.908]  No judge, no jury.
[00:46:34.908 --> 00:46:35.729]  No proof, no nothing.
[00:46:35.729 --> 00:46:36.409]  You just disappear.
[00:46:37.759 --> 00:46:41.500]  Like Brandon Robb, the Marine, who criticized Obama.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:50.001]  And so we are going to be discussing all of that today, but let me just go ahead and go to your phone calls right now here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:50.001 --> 00:46:54.182]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dexter in Maryland.
[00:46:54.182 --> 00:46:55.182]  Dexter, you're on the air.
[00:46:55.182 --> 00:46:59.303]  Hey, Alex, great to talk to you.
[00:46:59.303 --> 00:47:00.843]  Yeah, your phone's really, really low, brother.
[00:47:00.843 --> 00:47:03.083]  Is that an Obama phone?
[00:47:03.083 --> 00:47:05.284]  Is this a little better?
[00:47:05.284 --> 00:47:05.864]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[00:47:07.159 --> 00:47:11.562]  Okay, well, first of all, congratulations for Piers Morgan interview.
[00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:13.364]  That was epic.
[00:47:13.364 --> 00:47:19.048]  I do believe he'll have you back around, too, because he's so desperate for ratings, and it would be huge.
[00:47:19.048 --> 00:47:21.910]  But what I wanted to talk about was Sandy Hook.
[00:47:23.571 --> 00:47:26.772]  I'm somebody that believes that there's some fishiness there.
[00:47:26.772 --> 00:47:28.193]  I'd like to go through a couple things.
[00:47:28.193 --> 00:47:31.054]  I'm not sure if you've seen all these things yet.
[00:47:31.054 --> 00:47:39.837]  First, have you seen the video where the little girl's father comes out, like the first guy that came out to give an interview?
[00:47:39.837 --> 00:47:42.578]  Yeah, he's laughing and smiling and he says, do I read off the card?
[00:47:42.578 --> 00:47:50.201]  And then he turns the camera and then breaks and then sits there and looks like he's forcing himself to cry and then it looks like
[00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:56.075]  Bad acting from the worst soap opera you've ever seen.
[00:47:56.075 --> 00:47:59.700]  But people act strange under incredible pressure.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.243]  So none of us know what he's going through.
[00:48:02.243 --> 00:48:08.171]  So my prayers go out to him and his family.
[00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:10.454]  But yeah, a lot of people are investigating the whole thing.
[00:48:11.598 --> 00:48:23.269]  Well, one thing that's weird about him is that his daughter, by the end of the day, she had a Facebook page up that was a tribute that was already looking for money.
[00:48:23.269 --> 00:48:28.494]  It seems kind of odd that so quickly... Listen, here's the deal.
[00:48:28.494 --> 00:48:29.775]  I appreciate your call, bro.
[00:48:29.775 --> 00:48:34.880]  Look, I don't know about that, and I'm not going to talk about parents of dead kids, okay?
[00:48:38.536 --> 00:48:40.162]  See, I don't know if that's true.
[00:48:40.162 --> 00:48:41.667]  That's something I haven't seen.
[00:48:41.667 --> 00:48:45.379]  And so, it's just, I'm not going to talk about somebody who lost his daughter.
[00:48:46.878 --> 00:48:50.201]  Yes, there wasn't the AR-15 inside the school.
[00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:51.242]  Yes, it was in the car.
[00:48:51.242 --> 00:48:53.204]  Yes, there were multiple shooters outside.
[00:48:53.204 --> 00:48:57.908]  Mainstream media, RT, has attacked me saying, oh, five-year-old said they saw multiple shooters.
[00:48:57.908 --> 00:49:05.695]  No, it's on footage from the surveillance cameras from the helicopter they put on the news showing them arresting people in the woods dressed like the supposed shooter.
[00:49:05.695 --> 00:49:07.417]  And the whole thing's suspicious, okay?
[00:49:07.417 --> 00:49:09.119]  And I'm not trying to jump on you, caller.
[00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:10.100]  It's just that, you know,
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.282]  There are a lot of reports out there, a lot of people questioning the whole thing.
[00:49:13.282 --> 00:49:17.666]  I think that's healthy, but I'm not going to sit there and go after the dad.
[00:49:17.666 --> 00:49:23.270]  It's just... I'm gonna let other people, you know, do their own research.
[00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:24.371]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:49:24.371 --> 00:49:26.132]  Jessica in Canada, you're on the air.
[00:49:26.132 --> 00:49:28.715]  Hi Alex.
[00:49:28.715 --> 00:49:31.517]  Hey.
[00:49:31.517 --> 00:49:38.542]  I just wanted to, you did a great job with peers, and I just wanted to bring you up to date on a couple of things that are happening with Agenda 21 here in Canada.
[00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:39.143]  Tell us about it.
[00:49:40.578 --> 00:49:49.266]  Well, one, our environmental commissioner here in Ontario has decided that food waste is an environmental problem.
[00:49:49.266 --> 00:49:51.648]  And I just noticed that the UN has taken up this issue.
[00:49:51.648 --> 00:49:53.209]  So they're coming after our food, Alex.
[00:49:53.209 --> 00:49:55.852]  No, no, they're going to... They've already done this in England.
[00:49:56.352 --> 00:50:10.201]  They're going to tax you for everything that goes in the trash can, and they're going to have RFID on all the products that is scanned, this is already happening in London, to track, and they'll give you $3,000 fines for every infraction.
[00:50:10.201 --> 00:50:14.223]  It's already on the books in several Florida cities.
[00:50:14.223 --> 00:50:16.485]  And they go, don't worry, we'll never implement it.
[00:50:16.485 --> 00:50:23.089]  Kind of like they put it on the books under federal grants, start taking blood without warrants 15 years ago, now they're doing it.
[00:50:24.049 --> 00:50:25.070]  So you're absolutely right.
[00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:33.995]  Agenda 21 is a total surveillance grid where all the appliances track you and where they tax you to the point of total bankruptcy.
[00:50:33.995 --> 00:50:37.077]  It's to make sure you stay poor.
[00:50:37.077 --> 00:50:42.661]  And that you have to go on government subsistence so they can then shoot you up with deadly vaccines.
[00:50:42.661 --> 00:50:43.942]  Have you looked into Idle No More?
[00:50:43.942 --> 00:50:47.504]  Because it looks like the Tides Foundation is radicalizing our natives up here.
[00:50:49.284 --> 00:50:50.105]  Yeah, it's everywhere.
[00:50:50.105 --> 00:50:52.106]  The Tides Foundation is involved in a ton of stuff.
[00:50:52.106 --> 00:50:55.167]  Did you have anything else you wanted to add on this N21?
[00:50:55.167 --> 00:50:55.648]  Uh, nope.
[00:50:55.648 --> 00:50:58.749]  Just I'm a land-use planner and I've been fighting this for eight years.
[00:50:58.749 --> 00:50:59.490]  Well, good job.
[00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:03.112]  You give them hell.
[00:51:03.112 --> 00:51:07.875]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.

[00:53:02.162 --> 00:53:07.323]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives Ed peace of mind.
[00:53:07.323 --> 00:53:10.824]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[00:53:10.824 --> 00:53:17.205]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[00:53:17.205 --> 00:53:29.148]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[00:53:29.628 --> 00:53:34.293]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[00:53:34.293 --> 00:53:36.075]  And they're so easy to use.
[00:53:36.075 --> 00:53:37.977]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[00:53:37.977 --> 00:53:42.202]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[00:53:42.202 --> 00:53:43.423]  Fake TV is only $34.95.

[00:53:58.394 --> 00:54:10.262]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:10.262 --> 00:54:10.903]  There's a man.
[00:54:13.533 --> 00:54:23.898]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:54:23.898 --> 00:54:28.560]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:36.724]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down when the man comes around.
[00:54:39.861 --> 00:54:41.182]  We are back live.
[00:54:41.182 --> 00:54:45.164]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:54:45.164 --> 00:54:46.625]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[00:54:46.625 --> 00:54:49.947]  George in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:54:49.947 --> 00:54:51.508]  I noticed you called in about gun control.
[00:54:51.508 --> 00:54:52.228]  You volunteered.
[00:54:52.228 --> 00:55:05.396]  Are you excited that they're trial ballooning, executive orders, ATF rulemaking, or just Chuckie Schumer ordering Walmart and others to stop selling Semi-Autos?
[00:55:05.396 --> 00:55:09.358]  I mean, they're really trying to see if they can just sell us on being dictators.
[00:55:11.169 --> 00:55:22.507]  Yeah, I absolutely agree, and I first wanted to congratulate you on your appearance with Pierce Morgan on CNN, the state-run media, and I believe you did exactly what it takes.
[00:55:22.507 --> 00:55:25.832]  I think they're scared because you broke the spell, and I think this rush
[00:55:26.753 --> 00:55:29.954]  Well, I don't think I did it, but I'm certainly part of it, and so are you.
[00:55:29.954 --> 00:55:30.834]  We're all together in this.
[00:55:30.834 --> 00:55:34.195]  But, you know, earlier I said I would get into the victory, get into what's positive.
[00:55:34.195 --> 00:55:37.216]  I haven't really done that yet, but I've already said it before.
[00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:54.371]  Ten million guns sold last month.
[00:55:54.371 --> 00:55:56.432]  They're talking about more guns sold this month.
[00:55:56.432 --> 00:55:59.213]  They're saying soon everything will be sold out.
[00:55:59.213 --> 00:56:02.014]  There won't even be bolt-action 22s.
[00:56:02.014 --> 00:56:04.635]  Everything is going to be sold out.
[00:56:04.635 --> 00:56:06.716]  The ammo is selling out everywhere.
[00:56:06.716 --> 00:56:08.597]  That's the real vote.
[00:56:08.597 --> 00:56:12.598]  America knows the government is criminal and can't be trusted.
[00:56:12.598 --> 00:56:16.420]  America knows we're going into a depression and the state-run media lies.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:20.802]  And you know, we've talked about what to name the corporate globalist trader media.
[00:56:20.802 --> 00:56:21.682]  That's it.
[00:56:21.682 --> 00:56:24.183]  It's state-run media.
[00:56:24.183 --> 00:56:26.524]  That's the best term for it.
[00:56:26.524 --> 00:56:32.627]  And we're dealing with a global corporate fascist state that uses socialism at the grassroots to control us like flypaper.
[00:56:33.479 --> 00:56:35.181]  And there is a revolt.
[00:56:35.181 --> 00:56:37.062]  People are waking up.
[00:56:37.062 --> 00:56:41.746]  And that's why they're trying to act all confident and we've got a mandate for socialism now.
[00:56:41.746 --> 00:56:44.008]  Obama wasn't really re-elected.
[00:56:44.008 --> 00:56:46.450]  They had that thing fixed seven ways to Sunday.
[00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:48.852]  Running him up against that political corpse Romney.
[00:56:48.852 --> 00:56:54.517]  The evidence shows even though Romney was a dead horse,
[00:56:55.277 --> 00:56:58.663]  Still, he really beat Obama at the election fraud evidence shows.
[00:56:58.663 --> 00:57:00.566]  And not that that would have been good.
[00:57:00.566 --> 00:57:01.968]  He's globalist as well.
[00:57:01.968 --> 00:57:04.813]  They just think Obama can con people better.
[00:57:04.813 --> 00:57:05.814]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[00:57:06.877 --> 00:57:07.397]  No, no, no.
[00:57:07.397 --> 00:57:08.318]  No, you're good.
[00:57:08.318 --> 00:57:10.138]  And, you know, I'd like to make two points with you.
[00:57:10.138 --> 00:57:19.321]  I'd like you to explain to people just what a semi-automatic weapon actually is, because I don't think a lot of people realize that it includes pistols and handguns.
[00:57:19.321 --> 00:57:26.404]  I think they associate it with fully automatic, and they associate it with assault rifles, and they don't understand exactly what that is.
[00:57:26.404 --> 00:57:33.146]  Well, Feinstein has called for even revolvers to be banned before, but technically a semi-auto is pull the trigger once, a bullet fires.
[00:57:34.166 --> 00:57:35.406]  Pull it again, it fires again.
[00:57:35.406 --> 00:57:41.428]  And they obsess over full-auto that's worthless for actually killing people if you want to be selective about it.
[00:57:41.428 --> 00:57:50.250]  That's why the military doesn't use full-auto unless it's a heavy machine gun with big boxes of ammo in emplacements to take out large numbers of infantry.
[00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:55.072]  Or sometimes even used on the ground to mark targets in a primitive way for aircraft that are coming in.
[00:57:55.072 --> 00:57:59.553]  You know, they use tracers to mark targets and do other things.
[00:58:00.615 --> 00:58:04.158]  That's another issue studying military warfare.
[00:58:04.158 --> 00:58:11.865]  The truth is, when they say ban semi-autos, you don't need assault rifles, and they show a scary-looking black M16.
[00:58:11.865 --> 00:58:14.788]  Why people think that's scary, I don't know.
[00:58:14.788 --> 00:58:19.412]  And then they are saying, let's just get rid of these, when really it gets rid of almost all guns.
[00:58:19.412 --> 00:58:21.033]  Almost all shotguns, everything.
[00:58:21.033 --> 00:58:22.254]  Most guns are semi-auto.
[00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:28.922]  And they want to get rid of them, but their new bills even get rid of pump shotguns.
[00:58:28.922 --> 00:58:30.663]  So, I mean, they're coming for almost everything.
[00:58:30.663 --> 00:58:32.823]  Does that answer what you wanted me to do?
[00:58:32.823 --> 00:58:33.803]  Yeah, no.
[00:58:33.803 --> 00:58:34.784]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:34.784 --> 00:58:40.205]  And if I could, I'd like to tie that into an article you just had run yesterday on the death of Aaron Schwartz.
[00:58:40.205 --> 00:58:40.785]  Yeah, stay there.

[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:31.602]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls ahead of Obama Phone Lady, joining us in studio.
[01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:43.020]  I'm going to have a serious talk with her, and I'm sure we will have her on as an example of collectivization.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:51.248]  And at the same time, though, that she's a smart lady and has humanity in her, like all of us do, and that hopefully I can get through to her about Obama.
[01:00:52.524 --> 01:01:17.843]  So that is coming up, but George in Texas, yeah, Obama kill list critic found dead in New York City, prominent American blogger, and the guy that really headed up killing SOPA, the internet takeover, found hung, and they were trying to put him in jail for 35 years for downloading some MIT policy papers, research papers that taxpayers paid for, and posting them for the public to have.
[01:01:18.746 --> 01:01:21.628]  Talk about military-industrial complex, so they say, oh he committed suicide.
[01:01:21.628 --> 01:01:22.449]  That's what they'll do.
[01:01:22.449 --> 01:01:25.151]  They'll indict you, say you're depressed and kill you.
[01:01:25.151 --> 01:01:28.434]  Listen, if I ever get indicted, I'm gonna fight it forever.
[01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:30.136]  I will never commit suicide.
[01:01:30.136 --> 01:01:31.957]  And what they do is, even though the D.C.
[01:01:31.957 --> 01:01:45.109]  madam said on my show she'd never commit suicide, and then I knew behind the scenes she was being followed, being harassed, and I even had her condo manager on saying he was friends with her, and that he even gave me her handwriting, it wasn't her, they put out the suicide note, it wasn't even close.
[01:01:46.127 --> 01:01:50.730]  A totally different handwriting, and that she was being followed by men, was bringing stuff over to her mother's.
[01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:52.191]  They killed her, at her mother's.
[01:01:52.191 --> 01:01:54.233]  Out in the shed.
[01:01:54.233 --> 01:01:57.395]  And, uh, she said, I'll never commit suicide.
[01:01:57.395 --> 01:02:08.863]  And then, of course, they always, after somebody says, I'll never commit suicide, they have a quote, friend, someone who doesn't even really know them, always comes out in the news and says, oh shit, she told me she was gonna commit suicide.
[01:02:08.863 --> 01:02:09.864]  So, that's what'll happen.
[01:02:09.864 --> 01:02:12.346]  If they ever kill me, they'll have a friend.
[01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:20.867]  Come out and say, oh, Alex told me he was, and that person, that person was told by the killers and paid by the killers to do it.
[01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:25.029]  That person, that's the person involved, okay?
[01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.610]  You understand that?
[01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:28.531]  Because that's a bunch of baloney.
[01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:33.254]  If I was diagnosed with cancer, I will go with Darth Vader level surgeries and everything else.
[01:02:33.254 --> 01:02:35.276]  Alternative, you name it, okay?
[01:02:35.276 --> 01:02:40.499]  I'm going to go out of this world kicking and screaming and snapping like a crocodile.
[01:02:41.618 --> 01:02:42.339]  Okay?
[01:02:42.339 --> 01:02:43.800]  Let's just get that straight.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.021]  I'm going all the way, okay?
[01:02:46.021 --> 01:02:47.902]  Darth Vader-level medicine.
[01:02:47.902 --> 01:02:48.783]  Brain surgery.
[01:02:48.783 --> 01:02:49.343]  You name it.
[01:02:49.343 --> 01:02:50.544]  Lungs out on the table.
[01:02:50.544 --> 01:02:51.545]  Open-heart surgery.
[01:02:51.545 --> 01:02:53.686]  Whatever it is, I'm doing it.
[01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:55.327]  Let's get that straight.
[01:02:55.327 --> 01:02:56.988]  I'm never gonna commit suicide.
[01:02:56.988 --> 01:03:03.073]  Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never.
[01:03:03.073 --> 01:03:06.435]  And I would never murder-suicide my family.
[01:03:06.435 --> 01:03:07.956]  That's one of their other favorites.
[01:03:07.956 --> 01:03:09.197]  Just to wipe out a whole family.
[01:03:10.891 --> 01:03:11.211]  Never!
[01:03:11.211 --> 01:03:17.115]  If that ever happens, God forbid, knock on wood, pray to Jesus it won't happen, then you know I was killed.
[01:03:17.115 --> 01:03:19.137]  Real fast, your comments on that, George.
[01:03:20.314 --> 01:03:23.217]  I'm glad you said that because this is really a personal issue for me.
[01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:25.439]  The similarities between myself and Aaron Swartz.
[01:03:25.439 --> 01:03:26.780]  This is George from Austin.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.101]  I was out at the drone mob event.
[01:03:28.101 --> 01:03:29.643]  You had me in studio.
[01:03:29.643 --> 01:03:36.228]  I did the drone peaceful protest and I actually just made a video and uploaded it saying the exact same thing.
[01:03:36.228 --> 01:03:39.131]  I took a cue from you after the Pierce Morgan Show.
[01:03:39.131 --> 01:03:40.692]  I saw your videos when you're in the hotel.
[01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:41.393]  You're being followed.
[01:03:41.393 --> 01:03:42.234]  I saw the security guy.
[01:03:42.914 --> 01:03:48.460]  And so I felt I had to make a video and post it up on YouTube saying the exact same thing.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:49.901]  I'll never commit suicide.
[01:03:49.901 --> 01:03:50.982]  I love my life.
[01:03:50.982 --> 01:03:52.283]  I love my country.
[01:03:52.283 --> 01:03:54.766]  And I believe the solution to this is just to tell the truth.
[01:03:54.766 --> 01:03:55.967]  Wake people up.
[01:03:55.967 --> 01:03:57.648]  Political commentary.
[01:03:57.648 --> 01:04:04.575]  And, you know, it's really sad that I'm in fear that I could end up in the exact same situation.
[01:04:05.155 --> 01:04:12.883]  And so I posted that video up on YouTube, and I don't know if you'd allow me to, but I'd really feel a lot safer if your listeners could go take a look at it.
[01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:15.005]  Sure, what's the name of it?
[01:04:15.005 --> 01:04:18.148]  It's YouTube.com slash Young Truthers.
[01:04:18.148 --> 01:04:20.050]  Alright, listen, I gotta jump, but listen.
[01:04:21.175 --> 01:04:24.857]  Folks, the number one cause of death is automobile accidents.
[01:04:24.857 --> 01:04:25.798]  Well, not anymore.
[01:04:25.798 --> 01:04:27.319]  Now it's suicide.
[01:04:27.319 --> 01:04:29.560]  People killing themselves, then it's cars.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:34.964]  You're risking your life every day driving with cars going 70 in this lane, you're going 70 this lane.
[01:04:34.964 --> 01:04:37.145]  If you hit, it's 140 mile an hour, you're dead.
[01:04:37.145 --> 01:04:40.367]  I don't care how many seatbelts you're wearing, you're dead 99% of the time, okay?
[01:04:40.367 --> 01:04:41.728]  You're dead.
[01:04:41.728 --> 01:04:43.469]  I drive on roads where people die every week.
[01:04:44.833 --> 01:04:45.534]  Okay.
[01:04:45.534 --> 01:04:47.435]  And I still do it because I like to drive.
[01:04:47.435 --> 01:04:50.117]  Folks, take their power away.
[01:04:50.117 --> 01:04:51.557]  You're gonna die anyway someday.
[01:04:51.557 --> 01:04:55.560]  Let me tell you, if they keep killing people like this, folks aren't gonna put up with it.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.763]  And I'm not calling for that, but New World Order folks are the ones who better watch their butts.
[01:05:02.876 --> 01:05:05.897]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:05:05.897 --> 01:05:10.920]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:18.083]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:36.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:42.773]  It is the 14th day of January 2013 on this Monday edition.
[01:08:42.773 --> 01:08:52.318]  And coming up, after we take more phone calls and cover more news, we are going to have the one, the only, Obama phone lady on the broadcast.
[01:08:52.318 --> 01:08:59.321]  And if you don't know who the Obama phone lady is, perhaps this will remind you
[01:09:00.652 --> 01:09:06.936]  She's the lady who talked about Obama gave us a phone, and he's going to do more.
[01:09:06.936 --> 01:09:10.678]  Keep Obama in president, you know?
[01:09:10.678 --> 01:09:12.139]  He gave us a phone?
[01:09:12.139 --> 01:09:13.420]  He gave you a phone.
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.301]  How'd he give you a phone?
[01:09:15.301 --> 01:09:21.464]  You're on full stamps, you're on social security, you got low income, you disability.
[01:09:21.464 --> 01:09:23.485]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[01:09:23.485 --> 01:09:24.986]  Romney, he sucks!
[01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:25.206]  Hey!
[01:09:28.018 --> 01:09:28.799]  By the way, guys, that's enough.
[01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:29.660]  We are playing her.
[01:09:44.324 --> 01:09:47.027]  Out of the studio, and she's right there sitting behind him.
[01:09:47.027 --> 01:09:48.028]  And I gotta be honest.
[01:09:48.028 --> 01:09:52.552]  I mean, I'm getting goosebumps here and butterflies.
[01:09:52.552 --> 01:09:54.034]  Ma'am, can you please go to the green room?
[01:09:54.034 --> 01:09:55.756]  You're such a big star, and I'm not joking.
[01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:59.860]  For whatever reason, I'm having trouble continuing the broadcast here with you in there.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:05.966]  Did you get that chocolate shake I got you?
[01:10:05.966 --> 01:10:07.007]  She's awesome.
[01:10:07.007 --> 01:10:07.868]  Absolutely awesome.
[01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:10.966]  She's right there.
[01:10:10.966 --> 01:10:12.488]  I see you.
[01:10:12.488 --> 01:10:14.069]  This is incredible.
[01:10:14.069 --> 01:10:15.010]  She's already in command.
[01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.131]  Alright, you can stay there.
[01:10:16.131 --> 01:10:17.213]  That's fine.
[01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.055]  I just, it's, man.
[01:10:19.055 --> 01:10:19.875]  It is distracting.
[01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:22.979]  I tell you, this is a real fringe benefit.
[01:10:22.979 --> 01:10:24.300]  It's like caviar.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.442]  Being able to have, you know, that's one good thing about my job.
[01:10:26.442 --> 01:10:27.564]  I get to meet interesting people.
[01:10:28.707 --> 01:10:34.691]  And, uh, you know, we've got a lot of famous people in this building, but I tell you, nobody like Obama Phone Lady.
[01:10:34.691 --> 01:10:37.693]  Which, by the way, you know, the Democrats, uh, they, uh, she was working for them.
[01:10:37.693 --> 01:10:43.417]  They went and put her on the desk job, uh, after that, that, that viral video you just saw, uh, show.
[01:10:43.417 --> 01:10:50.442]  But we're gonna break that blockade here on air today, uh, with the Obama Phone Lady, but actually get down to the core of what this lady really stands for.
[01:10:51.826 --> 01:10:57.109]  And again, I sent the link out to the video when she was on the show at Real Alex Jones.
[01:10:57.109 --> 01:10:59.270]  Just go to Twitter forward slash Real Alex Jones.
[01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:03.392]  You want to find the link to the video last night of us hanging out around Austin, Texas.
[01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:06.713]  That video now obviously going viral.
[01:11:06.713 --> 01:11:12.396]  And we're going to print, again, dozens of questions that listeners are sending in for her.
[01:11:12.396 --> 01:11:16.438]  She'll be with us for an hour and a half while we take phone calls.
[01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:18.980]  We're going to have her in studio and she's going to do more.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:21.321]  She's going to answer your questions.
[01:11:23.476 --> 01:11:27.079]  She's going to describe why Romney sucks and why he sucks bad.
[01:11:27.079 --> 01:11:28.840]  So, let's go back to your calls.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:34.705]  You know what, let me hit one news item before I do that because I'll never get to it if I don't.
[01:11:34.705 --> 01:11:45.194]  Right here on the document, Kim, if you're watching on television, radio listeners, just search New York has tentative deal on gun control.
[01:11:45.194 --> 01:11:47.876]  And that's out of the Associated Press.
[01:11:47.876 --> 01:11:50.058]  And they're going to have mental health law.
[01:11:52.469 --> 01:11:57.693]  That allows for civil confinement of people determined to be a threat to others.
[01:11:57.693 --> 01:12:01.876]  And they're saying that if you criticize the government, that's a sign of mental illness.
[01:12:01.876 --> 01:12:05.078]  They're saying wanting to own guns is mental illness.
[01:12:05.078 --> 01:12:16.766]  And here is an article out of the Washington Post today, where again, these so-called liberals, who are really the authoritarians, they dictate reality.
[01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:21.430]  They say that when I went on Piers Morgan, that that was wrong.
[01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:28.083]  That I got in his face and that it was abnormal to yell or raise my voice.
[01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:31.824]  Now, Governor Cuomo raised his voice when he said we're going to get the guns last week.
[01:12:31.824 --> 01:12:33.304]  He started yelling and screaming.
[01:12:33.304 --> 01:12:34.324]  Everybody was cheering.
[01:12:34.324 --> 01:12:36.085]  Well, that's okay.
[01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:40.226]  That's okay because he's calling for our rights to be taken.
[01:12:40.226 --> 01:12:43.487]  But when I said, listen, don't try to take the guns or it'll cause a civil war.
[01:12:43.487 --> 01:12:44.767]  Do you understand that?
[01:12:44.767 --> 01:12:46.548]  Ron Paul agreed with me two days later last week.
[01:12:47.253 --> 01:12:50.896]  Just search, Ron Paul says, Second Amendment is the line in the sand.
[01:12:50.896 --> 01:12:54.559]  Attempt to take guns will cause civil war.
[01:12:54.559 --> 01:13:00.164]  Well, that's bad too, but when you read this article, whom does Alex Jones represent?
[01:13:00.164 --> 01:13:07.170]  They play this game of saying, mainline conservatives, Alex Jones represents you, and this is bad.
[01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:10.053]  You're discredited now, your Second Amendment's discredited.
[01:13:11.112 --> 01:13:12.133]  It's a total mind game.
[01:13:12.133 --> 01:13:15.255]  It's like them saying, there are no bills that take any of your guns.
[01:13:15.255 --> 01:13:16.516]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:13:16.516 --> 01:13:19.038]  Though this bill does take your guns, it's no big deal.
[01:13:19.038 --> 01:13:23.161]  You're like, you just said you don't take my guns.
[01:13:23.161 --> 01:13:33.829]  But because they're the boss, they're on the throne, up above us, in the clouds, oh, okay, you've introduced 11 bills that some of them even take
[01:13:35.674 --> 01:13:42.369]  Pump shotguns federally and they're at state levels and you've got state reps calling for door-to-door gun confiscation.
[01:13:42.369 --> 01:13:43.953]  Mainstream news covered that yesterday.
[01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:52.845]  All of this is going on, the military training manuals for confiscating guns, all this is happening, and they go, nobody wants your guns.
[01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.025]  Nobody's coming after your guns.
[01:13:54.025 --> 01:14:03.950]  You know, when that tank was slamming into the Waco church, and they had troops behind it firing their M16s into the building, the flare footage is clear, they were saying, this is not an assault, come out with your hands up.
[01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:11.574]  And there's footage of Davidians coming out with their hands up, you can see their body resonance heat, the flare footage, and they just shoot them, they fall down, and the tank runs over them.
[01:14:12.839 --> 01:14:17.122]  But they said, don't, you know, this is not an assault, come out with your hands up.
[01:14:17.122 --> 01:14:22.165]  And when they would come out, this is too big of a distraction now.
[01:14:22.165 --> 01:14:23.826]  My son and Obama lady together.
[01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:29.949]  Okay, hey, hey, hey, everybody out of the studio, seriously, out, out, okay?
[01:14:29.949 --> 01:14:32.171]  Yeah, that goes to my son, okay?
[01:14:32.171 --> 01:14:33.932]  It's a circus out there, man.
[01:14:33.932 --> 01:14:38.214]  I can't focus, there's all this stuff going on out there.
[01:14:38.214 --> 01:14:40.596]  We'll talk about chomping at the bit to be on the radio, that's my son.
[01:14:43.959 --> 01:14:46.941]  What is the point I was getting to here?
[01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:52.524]  They are selling everyone that they control reality.
[01:14:52.524 --> 01:14:57.888]  And so number one, if so-called conservatives don't agree with what I say, that's fine.
[01:14:57.888 --> 01:14:59.228]  We're not collectivist.
[01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:02.050]  I don't speak for you, you don't speak for me.
[01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:09.195]  But everybody's gotta, oh, we've gotta be nice and turn some of our guns in and we've gotta not raise our voices and we've gotta
[01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:17.017]  Yeah, how's that work for people that are constitutionalist, conservatives, libertarians, whatever you want to call it?
[01:15:17.017 --> 01:15:18.599]  I mean, Romney was for Obamacare.
[01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:27.847]  He wrote the thing for banning semi-autos, for open borders, for carbon taxes.
[01:15:27.847 --> 01:15:31.210]  Should I keep going on here?
[01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:33.272]  And that's who they ran so he would lose.
[01:15:34.335 --> 01:15:36.977]  Like a rigged Don King boxing match.
[01:15:36.977 --> 01:15:38.738]  I mean, come on, folks.
[01:15:38.738 --> 01:15:43.921]  And so I get up there and I go, listen, stop saying you don't want our guns and stop saying this is about kids.
[01:15:43.921 --> 01:15:45.522]  This is about authoritarianism.
[01:15:45.522 --> 01:15:46.622]  You're on notice.
[01:15:46.622 --> 01:15:48.424]  Don't start the civil war.
[01:15:48.424 --> 01:15:49.804]  Is that clear?
[01:15:49.804 --> 01:15:53.707]  You're a mouthpiece for globalist criminals and I'm putting you on notice.
[01:15:53.707 --> 01:15:58.810]  That's exactly what, in fact, I wish I'd have been more hardcore instead of even responding to anything he was saying.
[01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:05.028]  Now that hindsight's 20-20, I should have done more.
[01:16:05.028 --> 01:16:12.136]  Paul Revere rode through the countryside when they came for the guns, saying to arms, to arms, the British are coming.
[01:16:12.136 --> 01:16:13.477]  The Redcoats are coming.
[01:16:13.477 --> 01:16:15.720]  One of them by land, two of them by sea.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.323]  Our forebearers went out and killed people.
[01:16:20.256 --> 01:16:21.377]  I'm not calling for that.
[01:16:21.377 --> 01:16:22.638]  I don't want that to start.
[01:16:22.638 --> 01:16:24.479]  I want to fix this peacefully.
[01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:30.403]  But if so-called libertarians and conservatives can't handle somebody going, listen you twit!
[01:16:30.403 --> 01:16:33.485]  Go back to your country and stop telling me to turn my guns in!
[01:16:33.485 --> 01:16:38.588]  If they can't handle it, then may your chain set lightly upon you.
[01:16:38.588 --> 01:16:43.551]  Lick down and... Lick the hand that feeds you.
[01:16:43.551 --> 01:16:45.472]  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[01:16:45.472 --> 01:16:47.834]  Are you guys printing me the Patrick Henry liberty or death speech?
[01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:53.301]  I mean, why does New Hampshire say liberty or death on the license plates?
[01:16:53.301 --> 01:16:56.523]  Why do we get a tear in our eyes at the Star Spangled Banner?
[01:16:56.523 --> 01:16:57.503]  What's that song about?
[01:16:57.503 --> 01:17:03.266]  It's about people in a fort under bombardment, not giving up.
[01:17:03.266 --> 01:17:12.151]  It's about ragtag farmers and people taking on a military that had defeated the Spanish, the French, the Dutch, the Portuguese.
[01:17:12.151 --> 01:17:12.951]  You want me to keep going here?
[01:17:17.093 --> 01:17:24.839]  I mean, the British Army a few years later beat Napoleon.
[01:17:24.839 --> 01:17:33.726]  And our ancestors literally had to go bushwhack people by the end of the war to get ammo.
[01:17:33.726 --> 01:17:35.307]  And they don't want you knowing about that.
[01:17:35.307 --> 01:17:43.194]  I'm up here just saying, hey man, don't come to my country and tell me to turn my guns in and tell us collectively as gun owners that it's our fault somebody died.
[01:17:44.389 --> 01:17:46.410]  It's your fault for making that a gun-free zone!
[01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:49.933]  It's your fault for advertising the place to go kill people as a school!
[01:17:49.933 --> 01:17:51.234]  Boy, that really got to them.
[01:17:51.234 --> 01:17:52.775]  They were going, pull the plug, when I said that.
[01:17:52.775 --> 01:17:56.097]  They were, no, no, no, because they know that!
[01:17:56.097 --> 01:18:07.525]  They know, they're hyping school shootings every single day on corporate, New World Order, globalist-run, traitor media, hoping mentally ill people go into schools and shoot people.
[01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:14.721]  I mean, they are hyping copycatters like it's going out of style.
[01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:15.922]  And I put them on notice, man.
[01:18:15.922 --> 01:18:17.763]  They're trying to get more kids killed.
[01:18:17.763 --> 01:18:19.283]  They're the ones that set the whole thing up.
[01:18:19.283 --> 01:18:27.608]  They know full well that the drug inserts on those drugs... By the way, I've got Samjay Gupta, or whoever he pronounces him, the brain surgeon...
[01:18:28.396 --> 01:18:30.317]  Gupta and Tom Ridge.
[01:18:30.317 --> 01:18:41.343]  I saw a Natural News article today, always great reportage, but I didn't see where the links were to Samje Gupta and Ridge saying drugs are probably the cause of these shootings.
[01:18:41.343 --> 01:18:42.884]  So I went and searched what they said.
[01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:44.945]  It might have just been an oversight.
[01:18:44.945 --> 01:18:47.947]  And I actually found everything they said.
[01:18:47.947 --> 01:18:49.627]  I actually found the transcripts and the videos.
[01:18:49.627 --> 01:18:50.248]  I've got those.
[01:18:50.248 --> 01:18:52.169]  I told Paul Watson to add links to it.
[01:18:54.281 --> 01:18:56.423]  So good for that former head of Homeland Security.
[01:18:56.423 --> 01:18:57.644]  Man, what's going on with Tom Ridge?
[01:18:57.644 --> 01:18:59.886]  That guy has got like a conscience.
[01:18:59.886 --> 01:19:04.971]  He wrote a book saying Bush put out fake terror alerts as a pretext to take our liberties.
[01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:07.573]  And now he's come out and said we've got to look at these drugs.
[01:19:07.573 --> 01:19:10.216]  That's the main unifying issue.
[01:19:10.216 --> 01:19:15.481]  I mean, good job, former head of Homeland Security Ridge.
[01:19:17.693 --> 01:19:19.595]  By the way, the head of Homeland Security is a puppet, folks.
[01:19:19.595 --> 01:19:22.118]  He doesn't even know half of what's going on.
[01:19:22.118 --> 01:19:25.241]  This is an outside shadow government, not the front guys you see.
[01:19:25.241 --> 01:19:27.003]  I'm not saying Ridge is a perfect guy.
[01:19:27.003 --> 01:19:30.746]  I'm seeing signs, though, that he's got a heart and a soul.
[01:19:30.746 --> 01:19:31.847]  And that's all I'm looking for.
[01:19:31.847 --> 01:19:35.311]  All right, we'll take some more calls and get Obama phone lady in here.
[01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:42.299]  And the point is, is that they're telling you what is acceptable behavior.
[01:19:42.299 --> 01:19:43.720]  They're telling you what reality is.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.281]  They're telling you, you killed those kids collectively so you have guilt.
[01:19:47.281 --> 01:19:49.161]  And that makes me angry.
[01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:52.442]  And they're trying to get more kids killed.
[01:19:52.442 --> 01:19:53.622]  Okay?
[01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:56.683]  Now, what would George Washington do?
[01:19:56.683 --> 01:19:59.704]  Would George Washington cower to Piers Morgan?
[01:19:59.704 --> 01:20:01.104]  What would Thomas Paine do?
[01:20:02.967 --> 01:20:06.949]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[01:20:06.949 --> 01:20:14.472]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[01:20:14.472 --> 01:20:17.153]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:20:17.153 --> 01:20:23.776]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:20:23.776 --> 01:20:24.897]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[01:20:25.177 --> 01:20:34.207]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[01:20:34.207 --> 01:20:36.610]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early.
[01:20:39.014 --> 01:20:40.235]  But I can't feed you.

[01:22:02.273 --> 01:22:04.293]  What's going on with food prices?
[01:22:04.293 --> 01:22:08.834]  Have you noticed how your favorite ice cream is now 14 ounces instead of a pint?
[01:22:08.834 --> 01:22:14.715]  Round-trip airfares into nine major cities has increased 44% in just one year.
[01:22:14.715 --> 01:22:20.357]  Ask your 18 to 25 year old what it costs to buy some nice fashionable jeans.
[01:22:20.357 --> 01:22:20.757]  $300?
[01:22:20.757 --> 01:22:27.778]  And yet not one person in a hundred realizes these prices reflect government spending and Federal Reserve Bank dollar printing.
[01:22:28.158 --> 01:22:35.584]  Gold in the last 10 years has increased 450% while the dollar's purchasing power is declining daily.
[01:22:35.584 --> 01:22:37.025]  My name is Daniel Larson.
[01:22:37.025 --> 01:22:38.866]  I work at Midas Resources.
[01:22:38.866 --> 01:22:44.671]  To learn more about how gold and silver can protect your dwindling purchasing power and your IRA accounts,
[01:22:45.251 --> 01:22:45.991]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 134.

[01:22:47.452 --> 01:22:49.393]  Daniel Larson, 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[01:23:03.356 --> 01:23:05.598]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:23:05.598 --> 01:23:10.684]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:23:10.684 --> 01:23:12.486]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:23:12.486 --> 01:23:17.752]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[01:23:17.752 --> 01:23:24.959]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.581]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:23:28.581 --> 01:23:32.363]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:23:32.363 --> 01:23:40.906]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:23:40.906 --> 01:23:51.050]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:57.135]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[01:23:57.135 --> 01:23:59.157]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[01:24:22.645 --> 01:24:24.766]  Coming up!
[01:24:24.766 --> 01:24:26.908]  We're not going to be fighting though, but we are building it up.
[01:24:26.908 --> 01:24:29.049]  The Eye of the Tiger.
[01:24:29.049 --> 01:24:31.310]  The Obama phone lady.
[01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:33.892]  Right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:24:33.892 --> 01:24:35.433]  Rising up!
[01:24:35.433 --> 01:24:36.973]  Thrill of the fight!
[01:24:36.973 --> 01:24:38.074]  It's the Eye of the Tiger.
[01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:40.856]  In fact, we'll just re-intro her with this again.
[01:24:40.856 --> 01:24:43.437]  Kind of like her royal entrance.
[01:24:43.437 --> 01:24:45.959]  Whenever she comes on the broadcast.
[01:24:45.959 --> 01:24:47.440]  It's the Eye of the Tiger.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:47.820]  There it is.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.581]  Oh yeah.
[01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:13.666]  Let's go ahead, everybody you know you love that song, even though it's cheesy.
[01:25:13.666 --> 01:25:20.492]  Everybody knows when they're driving along, they turn this up.
[01:25:20.492 --> 01:25:23.634]  We're playing that off of YouTube, it's not doing it justice.
[01:25:23.634 --> 01:25:24.475]  Here it is, crank it up!
[01:25:33.104 --> 01:25:35.465]  Thank you, Jones, for having me on right now.
[01:25:56.451 --> 01:26:01.774]  Yeah, just want to talk to you about Jimmy Fazil.
[01:26:01.774 --> 01:26:11.300]  They just recently found out in the UK articles, a couple of UK articles, that he was involved with satanic ritualism, which is a really big shock, not to us of course.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:16.443]  No, David Icke said over a decade ago that he was a pedophile and a satanist, and that's on record.
[01:26:16.443 --> 01:26:18.284]  And he said it about a bunch of other people.
[01:26:18.284 --> 01:26:19.605]  David Icke worked at the BBC.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:26.944]  You can say what you want about the guy, but, you know, like George Orwell, he worked at the highest levels of the BBC.
[01:26:26.944 --> 01:26:30.246]  And, of course, Savelle, yeah, you're right, that's now coming out the Satanism, yep.
[01:26:31.638 --> 01:26:51.514]  Yeah, basically I was hoping, I know you do talk about this often, about how Satanism is involved in this, and I was wondering if you could do a future show really focusing on how deep Satanism has gone, whether it be in Nazism, in the past, and how it's led America down this path of darkness.
[01:26:52.335 --> 01:26:55.158]  Well, I mean, you could take one look at Jimmy Savelle.
[01:27:07.409 --> 01:27:13.954]  I mean, I can tell pretty much if somebody's a real Luciferian, because they look like that in the eyes.
[01:27:13.954 --> 01:27:16.356]  I don't care if they're black, white, who they are.
[01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:21.440]  That's a guy that hung out with a royal family like no one else and hung out and quote, supplied things.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:25.162]  He would brag, oh I supply special things to government parties.
[01:27:25.162 --> 01:27:32.268]  And see, they don't trust you at the highest levels of government now, because here's the news folks, they don't just hurt the children.
[01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:41.975]  Okay, if it all comes out on this guy from my sources, they don't just watch snuff films, and we know that's a huge industry.
[01:27:41.975 --> 01:27:43.756]  They produce them.
[01:27:43.756 --> 01:27:46.117]  Let's put him back on screen.
[01:27:46.117 --> 01:27:51.039]  International Business Times, Jimmy Savelle's satanic sex ring claim, star worship the devil.
[01:27:51.926 --> 01:27:58.368]  And all these top reporters are coming out and saying, yeah, he would just brag about worshiping the devil, how he was with the royal family.
[01:27:58.368 --> 01:28:02.349]  This is a guy who could get into the royal palaces, had his own keys and stuff.
[01:28:02.349 --> 01:28:05.650]  Nobody got that.
[01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:06.910]  And I mean, that's who they are.
[01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:07.670]  That's who we're fighting.
[01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:10.291]  I mean, I sit here and that's why I should be so serious.
[01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:13.892]  I joke around and stuff because I can't be serious all the time or I'd go crazy.
[01:28:13.892 --> 01:28:18.753]  But I mean, yes, we're dealing with Satanists that want to torture children to death.
[01:28:18.753 --> 01:28:20.254]  I mean, that's who we're fighting.
[01:28:20.254 --> 01:28:21.334]  That's who runs the government.
[01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:27.111]  And if people don't get that, there's no future.
[01:28:27.111 --> 01:28:28.632]  Yeah.
[01:28:28.632 --> 01:28:38.295]  Yeah, just basically at the, you know, when I talk to people about this stuff, that's eventually where I lead them to, and they don't want to believe it, and then when they find out for themselves, they're like, wow, this is really happening.
[01:28:38.295 --> 01:28:41.555]  I want people to learn to see the look.
[01:28:41.555 --> 01:28:42.296]  Watch it back up.
[01:28:42.296 --> 01:28:42.856]  You see that guy?
[01:28:44.073 --> 01:28:45.294]  I have been to the court cases.
[01:28:45.294 --> 01:28:46.695]  I've covered it with the CPS.
[01:28:46.695 --> 01:28:47.977]  Half of them look like that.
[01:28:47.977 --> 01:28:52.140]  Men or women, black or white, they look just like that.
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:57.705]  When you're possessed by whatever demon is in those people, that's what it looks like on your screen if you're a TV viewer.
[01:28:57.705 --> 01:29:02.429]  If you don't know who Jimmy Savelle is, just search Engine It and get ready.
[01:29:02.429 --> 01:29:07.594]  And let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that is a demon of hell.
[01:29:07.594 --> 01:29:08.835]  A demon of hell.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:18.069]  And the only reason this is all coming out right now is the EU is blackmailing the British government to bring down England and put them into the EU.
[01:29:18.069 --> 01:29:20.132]  Oh yeah, you didn't know that's why this was all coming out right now?
[01:29:21.007 --> 01:29:22.328]  And more even may come out.
[01:29:22.328 --> 01:29:29.151]  They may come out on the news someday and say, yeah, we chop kids' heads off and drink their blood as it sprays out of their stump.
[01:29:29.151 --> 01:29:30.472]  They'll be like, well, that's good.
[01:29:30.472 --> 01:29:31.452]  But I don't want to do that.
[01:29:31.452 --> 01:29:33.093]  Well, you're an extremist, you know?
[01:29:33.093 --> 01:29:36.195]  Because the Aztecs cut kids' hearts out every day when the sun came up.
[01:29:36.195 --> 01:29:38.636]  And if you didn't think that was normal, they'd kill you.
[01:29:38.636 --> 01:29:39.697]  You're like, but that's crazy.
[01:29:39.697 --> 01:29:40.557]  No.
[01:29:40.557 --> 01:29:43.579]  When you're in the devil worshipper kingdom, you're crazy.
[01:29:43.579 --> 01:29:47.621]  See, those of us that don't like all this, and are like, hey, you're not getting my guns, devil worshippers.
[01:29:47.861 --> 01:29:49.563]  They're like, you're mentally ill.
[01:29:49.563 --> 01:29:52.286]  We're gonna have to put you in solitary.
[01:29:52.286 --> 01:29:53.668]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.668 --> 01:29:56.211]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:30:03.035 --> 01:30:07.036]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[01:30:07.036 --> 01:30:14.539]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[01:30:14.539 --> 01:30:17.239]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

[01:30:23.842 --> 01:30:24.982]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[01:30:25.262 --> 01:30:34.292]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[01:30:34.292 --> 01:30:38.257]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[01:30:38.257 --> 01:30:40.119]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.

[01:32:05.522 --> 01:32:10.524]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:17.707]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:32:17.847 --> 01:32:23.471]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:27.514]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:32:27.514 --> 01:32:32.237]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:32:32.237 --> 01:32:37.261]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:32:37.681 --> 01:32:39.322]  We're getting prepared.
[01:32:39.322 --> 01:32:39.982]  Are you?
[01:32:39.982 --> 01:32:40.723]  Infowarsshop.com
[01:33:11.034 --> 01:33:14.558]  All the leaves are brown.
[01:33:14.558 --> 01:33:17.661]  And the sky is grey.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:52.773]  Michelle Dowery is in studio with us, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll cue up the Obamaphone famous audio video here in a moment for folks.
[01:33:52.773 --> 01:33:58.199]  So new listeners who don't know who she is can get an idea and be reminded.
[01:33:58.199 --> 01:34:02.943]  But when she flew into town last night, there were people at the airport taking photos, shooting video of her.
[01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:08.627]  Also, there were people when we went out to eat who were coming over wanting to take photographs with her.
[01:34:08.627 --> 01:34:11.509]  I mean, that's the power of YouTube.
[01:34:11.509 --> 01:34:15.571]  And it wasn't just that it was somebody on there saying, I want Obama to give me something.
[01:34:15.571 --> 01:34:17.253]  There's plenty of videos like that.
[01:34:17.253 --> 01:34:19.594]  It's that she was interesting and she was funny.
[01:34:19.594 --> 01:34:28.700]  And so people ask, why did you bring Obama phone lady down to Austin, Texas to be in studio with us?
[01:34:29.588 --> 01:34:34.311]  Well, and her husband as well, who we've had a chance to hang out with, Harvey.
[01:34:34.311 --> 01:34:37.833]  We brought her down here because she's a phenomenon.
[01:34:37.833 --> 01:34:43.857]  And I guess the way she disappeared from being an obvious Democratic Party canvasser to disappearing
[01:34:44.733 --> 01:34:50.357]  That they had put her up in an office, and that is indeed what she told me last night on video.
[01:34:50.357 --> 01:34:56.201]  And, you know, I thought, hey, let's actually hear from the person, the real person, not just a short clip.
[01:34:56.201 --> 01:35:10.150]  Let's see what she really stands for, what she really believes in, just from a sociology perspective, to really understand what is in the mind of someone who really thinks Obama's a great guy.
[01:35:10.150 --> 01:35:13.352]  There are a lot of people that think Mitt Romney was a great guy.
[01:35:13.352 --> 01:35:14.353]  I didn't like Mitt Romney either.
[01:35:15.434 --> 01:35:19.577]  Her son, you know, thinks that I'm a Republican because I don't like Obama.
[01:35:19.577 --> 01:35:27.404]  Whenever a Republican gets in office, people think I'm a Democrat because I don't like it when Republican presidents are torturing and wars and all this.
[01:35:27.404 --> 01:35:33.249]  I just marvel at how when somebody's guy is in office, be they Republican or Democrat,
[01:35:33.829 --> 01:35:38.355]  They suddenly switch off their thinking process, and if the other party was doing that, they'd be upset.
[01:35:38.355 --> 01:35:43.022]  But because it's seen as their guy, well then, everything is great.
[01:35:43.022 --> 01:35:47.408]  But here is the Obama phone lady clip.
[01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:47.729]  Here it is.
[01:35:48.626 --> 01:35:49.567]  You got Obama phone?
[01:35:49.567 --> 01:35:51.668]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone.
[01:35:51.668 --> 01:35:52.489]  Keep Obama in president, you know?
[01:35:52.489 --> 01:35:53.230]  He gave us a phone.
[01:35:53.230 --> 01:35:54.130]  He gave you a phone.
[01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:54.871]  He's gonna do more.
[01:35:54.871 --> 01:35:55.632]  How'd he give you a phone?
[01:35:55.632 --> 01:35:58.774]  You sign up and you're on food stamps, you're on Social Security, you got low income, you disability.
[01:35:58.774 --> 01:35:59.294]  I have a question.
[01:35:59.294 --> 01:36:00.635]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[01:36:00.635 --> 01:36:01.056]  Romney, he sucks!
[01:36:01.056 --> 01:36:01.136]  Hey!
[01:36:01.136 --> 01:36:01.256]  Obama!
[01:36:01.256 --> 01:36:01.876]  You got Obama phone?
[01:36:01.876 --> 01:36:03.358]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone.
[01:36:03.358 --> 01:36:04.438]  Keep Obama in president, you know?
[01:36:04.438 --> 01:36:04.979]  He gave us a phone.
[01:36:04.979 --> 01:36:05.539]  He's gonna do more.
[01:36:05.539 --> 01:36:06.300]  How'd he give you a phone?
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:08.682]  You sign up and you're on food stamps, you're on Social Security, you got low income, you disability.
[01:36:08.682 --> 01:36:09.242]  I have a question.
[01:36:09.242 --> 01:36:10.783]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[01:36:10.783 --> 01:36:11.964]  Romney, he sucks!
[01:36:11.964 --> 01:36:12.465]  Hey!
[01:36:12.465 --> 01:36:12.585]  Obama!
[01:36:12.585 --> 01:36:13.706]  You got Obama phone?
[01:36:13.706 --> 01:36:15.307]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone.
[01:36:15.996 --> 01:36:21.100]  Okay, now she's going to be with us for the next hour and 20 minutes, maybe even into overdrive.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:33.529]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I know we've got callers on other issues holding, but you can address your question to myself and, of course, to Michelle Dowery, who is here in studio with us.
[01:36:33.529 --> 01:36:39.353]  But first off, Michelle, I want to commend you for having the courage to come down here.
[01:36:39.353 --> 01:36:42.996]  Describe that thinking process and how that happened, and then tell people a little bit about yourself.
[01:36:43.934 --> 01:36:44.895]  Okay, you fans.
[01:36:44.895 --> 01:36:46.536]  My name is Michelle Dowry.
[01:36:46.536 --> 01:36:48.517]  I live in Cleveland, Ohio.
[01:36:48.517 --> 01:36:51.219]  I work for the Obama campaign.
[01:36:51.219 --> 01:36:55.042]  The campaign was over November 11th.
[01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:04.467]  I went out and campaigned for Obama to get voters in to vote for Obama.
[01:37:04.467 --> 01:37:08.752]  One thing I liked what I did, this was like my second year campaigning.
[01:37:08.752 --> 01:37:10.995]  You know, he won, this is the second four years.
[01:37:10.995 --> 01:37:13.378]  The first four years I did it and it's the second.
[01:37:14.299 --> 01:37:16.220]  A lot of people didn't know about voting.
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.302]  They thought if you had a warrant for your arrest, you couldn't vote.
[01:37:19.302 --> 01:37:22.464]  I explained to them that had anything to do with it.
[01:37:22.464 --> 01:37:29.168]  Some people wanted to vote, thought if they go get an ID that the police would get them, no.
[01:37:29.168 --> 01:37:37.053]  We had people that wasn't from this country, but they had foreign IDs, which they've been here two, three years.
[01:37:37.053 --> 01:37:40.135]  They need to go change it over and get a state ID to vote.
[01:37:41.389 --> 01:37:46.793]  Um, it was very nice, very interesting, what I did.
[01:37:46.793 --> 01:37:50.396]  When you talk about people, uh, U.S.
[01:37:50.396 --> 01:37:52.337]  citizens that have been out of the country?
[01:37:52.337 --> 01:37:55.159]  Yeah, we had people that was from, um, overseas.
[01:37:55.159 --> 01:38:00.563]  A few of them that didn't even have Ohio State ID and been here two, three years.
[01:38:00.563 --> 01:38:01.824]  So I explained... Were they U.S.
[01:38:01.824 --> 01:38:02.624]  citizens?
[01:38:02.624 --> 01:38:04.526]  Yeah, they were not from, from Ohio.
[01:38:05.086 --> 01:38:05.787]  But they were U.S.
[01:38:05.787 --> 01:38:06.147]  citizens.
[01:38:06.147 --> 01:38:06.587]  Right.
[01:38:06.587 --> 01:38:07.248]  They were U.S.
[01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:11.251]  citizens now, but they didn't even take the effort to get their state ID yet.
[01:38:11.251 --> 01:38:20.298]  So I opened some doors for a couple of them people, too, because, you know, once I told them how you had to have a state ID and a vote, they went and got a state ID and they voted.
[01:38:22.315 --> 01:38:24.176]  Let me be honest with you.
[01:38:24.176 --> 01:38:33.318]  The first thing that pops in some listeners' minds, and the first thing that, you know, popped in my wife's mind was, oh, the Obama phone lady, you know, don't be mean to her.
[01:38:33.318 --> 01:38:36.219]  Obviously, I'm not here to get you here to be mean to you.
[01:38:36.219 --> 01:38:51.463]  In fact, contrary to that, I would like to try to see if I can communicate with you and actually show you the fact that Obama is just as bad as the Republicans, probably even worse, and that he does not have your best interest at heart, and he's an incredible liar.
[01:38:52.003 --> 01:38:54.125]  But again, that's my view.
[01:38:54.125 --> 01:38:55.686]  Tell us why you like Obama.
[01:38:57.967 --> 01:39:00.209]  I liked Obama.
[01:39:00.209 --> 01:39:10.459]  I had seen him last year win, and some things had went on by me being a minority and didn't know no better.
[01:39:10.459 --> 01:39:13.581]  I know he really didn't set the phones off.
[01:39:13.581 --> 01:39:22.349]  Once I spoke on that on YouTube, they showed me that it was passed, but when Obama got an election,
[01:39:23.487 --> 01:39:25.988]  It was, it was Obama phones.
[01:39:25.988 --> 01:39:28.469]  That's how- Well, they radically increased the funding.
[01:39:28.469 --> 01:39:29.070]  Right.
[01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:33.052]  But he didn't put that bill out for us to get the Obama phone.
[01:39:33.052 --> 01:39:34.112]  That was Clinton, right?
[01:39:34.112 --> 01:39:34.712]  Yes.
[01:39:34.712 --> 01:39:38.674]  Okay, so- Did you know that my mother now calls her phone the Obama phone?
[01:39:38.674 --> 01:39:41.936]  Well, everybody in Cleveland calls them Obama phones.
[01:39:41.936 --> 01:39:46.258]  If you look on, you know, and this is weird- No, we just call cell phones Obama phones now, period.
[01:39:46.698 --> 01:39:51.880]  Well, that's not... It's like people don't call search engines search engines, they call them Googles.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:57.602]  Well, I never, I never knew about it till I applied and I got one.
[01:39:57.602 --> 01:40:00.043]  So, they are called Obama's phone.
[01:40:00.043 --> 01:40:03.144]  He got the name for them, but he didn't... How many Obama phones do you have?
[01:40:04.679 --> 01:40:06.821]  Now expanding on that.
[01:40:24.569 --> 01:40:29.411]  I mean, do you see the danger of people getting to where they're dependent on the government?
[01:40:29.411 --> 01:40:30.251]  Yes, I do.
[01:40:30.251 --> 01:40:31.651]  Even myself.
[01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:33.112]  But I'm coming out of it.
[01:40:33.112 --> 01:40:34.832]  Well, I mean, you've got a job.
[01:40:34.832 --> 01:40:35.833]  Yes, I got a job.
[01:40:35.833 --> 01:40:38.334]  I started the day after Christmas.
[01:40:38.334 --> 01:40:39.414]  26th of December.
[01:40:43.166 --> 01:40:58.715]  My issue is, obviously government at some levels needs to be there as a safety net, but government, and I can actually after the show today show you some of their statements, about a hundred years ago said, we need to take control of society, we're going to do it by making people dependent.
[01:40:58.715 --> 01:41:02.937]  And they didn't set up welfare and stuff to help people, they set it up to control people.
[01:41:02.937 --> 01:41:03.997]  Right, right.
[01:41:03.997 --> 01:41:05.118]  And that's true.
[01:41:05.118 --> 01:41:08.080]  I've seen that with my own eyes in Cleveland and in Ohio.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:14.226]  They set it up to control you and have some, um, where they can feed back and get you right in.
[01:41:14.226 --> 01:41:18.710]  You know, I'm one of the ones, I got a child that I get child support for.
[01:41:18.710 --> 01:41:27.339]  And, um, by me getting the child support, here it is, the dad been, the child is 10 years old, the dad been working off and on, and we're not getting any money.
[01:41:28.345 --> 01:41:30.806]  And I'm asking the child support people, what you mean?
[01:41:30.806 --> 01:41:31.826]  Here he is working.
[01:41:31.826 --> 01:41:38.409]  I need to send the Toronto News people in there because here he is working and he keeps saying they're taking the money out, but we ain't getting none.
[01:41:38.409 --> 01:41:39.450]  And we haven't got any.
[01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:41.130]  He's 10 years old.
[01:41:41.130 --> 01:41:44.652]  So here I am right now, where's Obama now?
[01:41:44.652 --> 01:41:51.915]  You know, and like one thing, I'm glad he won the elections, but I want to see what he's going to do.
[01:41:51.915 --> 01:41:54.196]  You told me that last night.
[01:41:54.196 --> 01:41:56.797]  What do you expect Obama to do?
[01:41:56.797 --> 01:41:57.397]  What could he do?
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:41:59.422]  What could he do?
[01:41:59.422 --> 01:42:00.345]  He could do a lot.
[01:42:00.345 --> 01:42:03.556]  He's the man with the plan on the 25th of January.
[01:42:03.556 --> 01:42:04.599]  But is he gonna do it?
[01:42:05.307 --> 01:42:06.087]  You know?
[01:42:06.087 --> 01:42:09.169]  And I know they keep saying it takes time, it takes time, it takes time.
[01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:14.713]  Only thing I've seen he did, you know, they passed the election and people calling Obama phones.
[01:42:14.713 --> 01:42:18.155]  But for others in Ohio, I haven't seen him do too much.
[01:42:18.155 --> 01:42:21.236]  He haven't even put up his office on Lee and Harvard.
[01:42:21.236 --> 01:42:24.158]  He's supposed to be rebuilding it and everything.
[01:42:24.158 --> 01:42:25.279]  He haven't did that yet.
[01:42:25.279 --> 01:42:27.580]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:30.402]  Have you noticed prices have gone up on most products?
[01:42:30.402 --> 01:42:31.442]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:31.442 --> 01:42:31.863]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:31.863 --> 01:42:33.824]  Prices, gas, cigarettes.
[01:42:34.721 --> 01:42:37.423]  Do you know what the private fellow reserve is?
[01:42:37.423 --> 01:42:38.983]  No, I don't.
[01:42:38.983 --> 01:42:49.490]  Well, this country was taken over in 1913 by offshore European banks, and they've been devaluing the dollar ever since, but most of the devaluations happened in the last 15 years or so.
[01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:55.973]  And Obama has got the printing presses turned up on high, but all that's doing is devaluing the dollar.
[01:42:58.855 --> 01:43:02.404]  Really can't do anything for the people long term.
[01:43:02.404 --> 01:43:06.273]  Anything he does do will end up being turned towards bad.
[01:43:06.273 --> 01:43:07.756]  That's the problem with big government.
[01:43:07.756 --> 01:43:08.699]  That's why it doesn't work.
[01:43:10.151 --> 01:43:11.152]  I heard that too.
[01:43:11.152 --> 01:43:23.097]  Did you know that in communities, in the black community, that quote illegitimacy, that is the parents getting divorced or the dad never being there, was less than 10% back in the 50s and now it's over 90%?
[01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:24.798]  Oh yeah.
[01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:26.379]  I mean the state has taken over.
[01:43:26.379 --> 01:43:28.780]  But it's not just the black community, it's happening everywhere now.
[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:29.380]  Right.
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:32.842]  I mean it's like a plague, wherever government takes over.
[01:43:32.842 --> 01:43:36.264]  So I mean what will more government money do?
[01:43:39.699 --> 01:43:44.621]  Well, um, what I look at it as, well, what government money do is nothing.
[01:43:44.621 --> 01:43:46.242]  It's not doing anything.
[01:43:46.242 --> 01:43:50.623]  Here I am as a living sacrifice and it haven't did anything to me.
[01:43:50.623 --> 01:43:53.825]  You know, feed us and get bigger and bigger with the food stamps.
[01:43:53.825 --> 01:43:56.966]  Father's cash, they've been stopped the cash.
[01:43:56.966 --> 01:44:01.088]  So, he's not really doing anything right now.
[01:44:01.088 --> 01:44:06.230]  But how do we go from being able to feed the whole world 50 years ago to where we can't even produce our own food now?
[01:44:07.423 --> 01:44:10.804]  See, globalism is poverty.
[01:44:10.804 --> 01:44:12.584]  The policy is poverty.
[01:44:12.584 --> 01:44:16.205]  They want to make you poor so that they can control you.
[01:44:16.205 --> 01:44:20.166]  Do you know how horses got domesticated?
[01:44:20.166 --> 01:44:21.707]  Do you know how pigs got domesticated?
[01:44:21.707 --> 01:44:24.908]  Do you know how cows got domesticated?
[01:44:24.908 --> 01:44:25.508]  No, I don't.
[01:44:26.946 --> 01:44:31.109]  Well, it's the same way we're becoming domesticated.
[01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:33.811]  You simply set up an area and start putting food out for them.
[01:44:33.811 --> 01:44:34.792]  Then they get used to eating it.
[01:44:34.792 --> 01:44:37.034]  Then you put a fence up around it but leave a gate open.
[01:44:37.034 --> 01:44:37.934]  Then they start going in.
[01:44:37.934 --> 01:44:39.976]  Then you just go close the gate one day.
[01:44:39.976 --> 01:44:43.518]  Then you make them come to you when they're starving to get the food.
[01:44:43.518 --> 01:44:47.281]  And pretty soon, you're on a spit being basically roasted.
[01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:50.564]  That's being sent off to fight illegal wars.
[01:44:50.564 --> 01:44:51.244]  Here's an example.
[01:44:51.244 --> 01:44:54.907]  To get welfare, in a lot of states, they try to force you to take vaccines.
[01:44:56.391 --> 01:44:59.892]  Do you know folks that are on welfare?
[01:44:59.892 --> 01:45:00.932]  Yes.
[01:45:00.932 --> 01:45:03.893]  Do they tell you that you've got to take vaccines?
[01:45:03.893 --> 01:45:04.673]  No.
[01:45:04.673 --> 01:45:05.473]  They don't?
[01:45:05.473 --> 01:45:05.913]  No.
[01:45:05.913 --> 01:45:07.013]  Do you take vaccines?
[01:45:07.013 --> 01:45:07.694]  No.
[01:45:07.694 --> 01:45:08.254]  You don't?
[01:45:08.254 --> 01:45:08.854]  No.
[01:45:08.854 --> 01:45:09.774]  Why?
[01:45:09.774 --> 01:45:10.514]  Vaccines?
[01:45:10.514 --> 01:45:10.794]  Yes.
[01:45:10.794 --> 01:45:11.775]  Vaccination shots?
[01:45:11.775 --> 01:45:12.375]  Yeah.
[01:45:12.375 --> 01:45:17.016]  Because I had all my shots.
[01:45:17.016 --> 01:45:21.597]  What would you say if I told you that they put all sorts of deadly things in those shots?
[01:45:23.052 --> 01:45:25.013]  Well, that's now.
[01:45:25.013 --> 01:45:28.274]  I'm a little older, so I won't need no vaccination shot.
[01:45:28.274 --> 01:45:30.595]  Well, they are starting to try to make adults take them.
[01:45:30.595 --> 01:45:33.596]  Do you know about the Tuskegee experiments?
[01:45:33.596 --> 01:45:36.677]  Where they put them in animals or something?
[01:45:36.677 --> 01:45:38.857]  Hold on, I've got my phone going off here.
[01:45:38.857 --> 01:45:40.858]  I've got my Obama phone going off right here.
[01:45:42.597 --> 01:45:46.078]  Anyways, now we're having a serious interview here all of a sudden.
[01:45:46.078 --> 01:45:50.959]  You were pretty wound up last night, so was I. I am still wound up.
[01:45:50.959 --> 01:45:53.020]  Look, I've got so many questions here that I could ask.
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:55.161]  I know we've got so many callers on so many fronts.
[01:45:55.161 --> 01:45:59.782]  Let me just give you one example right here because I'm not here to beat you up because you're an Obama supporter.
[01:46:00.427 --> 01:46:10.677]  I mean, I get the argument of, well, the Republicans, you know, they're, you know, torture, secret arrest, wars, lying, corporate welfare, banker bailouts.
[01:46:10.677 --> 01:46:13.399]  You know, at least Obama says he wants to help me.
[01:46:13.399 --> 01:46:21.267]  My issue is, did you hear how they paid $22 billion to ship General Motors Cadillac and Volt plants to China?
[01:46:21.267 --> 01:46:23.809]  Now, I mean, it's one thing if they left the country.
[01:46:23.809 --> 01:46:25.050]  We paid to make them leave.
[01:46:26.349 --> 01:46:27.970]  And there's hundreds of things like that.
[01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:36.574]  Did you know Obama, Congress wouldn't pass a law that he's shutting down our coal power plants and power prices are going up everywhere?
[01:46:36.574 --> 01:46:38.795]  You know why that is?
[01:46:38.795 --> 01:46:40.036]  No.
[01:46:40.036 --> 01:46:41.496]  People, I don't know.
[01:46:41.496 --> 01:46:42.937]  No, I don't.
[01:46:42.937 --> 01:46:49.420]  My point is, Obama is a front man for some very dangerous criminal organizations.
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:50.661]  Have you heard of the New World Order?
[01:46:51.564 --> 01:46:52.684]  A little bit.
[01:46:52.684 --> 01:46:53.385]  I heard you talk about it.
[01:46:53.385 --> 01:46:55.825]  Okay, these are people that want you dead.
[01:46:55.825 --> 01:46:56.366]  Mm-hmm.
[01:46:56.366 --> 01:46:59.127]  Have you heard about the tens of thousands of experiments killing U.S.
[01:46:59.127 --> 01:47:01.247]  troops, killing foster children?
[01:47:01.247 --> 01:47:02.608]  Yeah, I heard about it.
[01:47:02.608 --> 01:47:03.528]  Yeah, I mean, they admit it.
[01:47:03.528 --> 01:47:06.109]  They want you to know all day, we're the government, we kill you.
[01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:07.009]  Right.
[01:47:07.009 --> 01:47:10.290]  Did you hear about the thousands of black people injected with syphilis?
[01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:10.991]  Yeah, I heard about it.
[01:47:10.991 --> 01:47:12.031]  That's Tuskegee.
[01:47:12.031 --> 01:47:12.571]  Right.
[01:47:12.571 --> 01:47:16.353]  And that's the reason I raised that, not because you're black, but because people have heard of that.
[01:47:16.353 --> 01:47:16.973]  Right.
[01:47:16.973 --> 01:47:19.274]  That was a 50-year program, okay?
[01:47:19.274 --> 01:47:20.414]  And nobody got in trouble for that?
[01:47:21.058 --> 01:47:22.019]  Right.
[01:47:22.019 --> 01:47:29.147]  Did you know the UN gave millions of kids in India vaccines last year and 60 plus thousand of them got paralyzed?
[01:47:29.147 --> 01:47:32.871]  I mean, those kids are never going to run and play again.
[01:47:32.871 --> 01:47:33.392]  They're paralyzed.
[01:47:33.392 --> 01:47:35.054]  A lot of them died.
[01:47:35.054 --> 01:47:40.320]  Now, did you know they put that in the back of the paper like it was like they were talking about the price of gasoline or something?
[01:47:41.345 --> 01:47:43.948]  Now, why would the government put U.S.
[01:47:43.948 --> 01:47:46.291]  troops in chambers and nerve gas them to death?
[01:47:46.291 --> 01:47:47.933]  Guys hadn't done anything.
[01:47:47.933 --> 01:47:50.055]  Black, white, you know, kill you.
[01:47:50.055 --> 01:47:51.037]  Why would we trust them?
[01:47:52.628 --> 01:47:54.930]  In a way, I really don't.
[01:47:54.930 --> 01:48:05.198]  As I'm a living sacrifice now here in America, and I did all this work for the help with Obama, you know you got paid a dollar sign nice and everything.
[01:48:05.198 --> 01:48:08.760]  But four years ago, he said what he was going to do, and he still ain't done it.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:10.462]  Why is it taking so long?
[01:48:10.462 --> 01:48:17.787]  He said the mothers that, like me, got kids, a 10 and a 15 year old, how should if I don't have a job just getting food stamps?
[01:48:17.787 --> 01:48:18.468]  How could I live?
[01:48:18.468 --> 01:48:19.489]  How could I pay my rent?
[01:48:20.349 --> 01:48:25.051]  And these are people that press for you to win.
[01:48:25.051 --> 01:48:32.734]  And then I look at him like he being a black president, at least he look out for the black minority who got you in this chair.
[01:48:32.734 --> 01:48:46.820]  because even with me doing what I did, by being a lot of big shot white guys around, they didn't really want to see me go from canvassing on the streets to an office job.
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:48.501]  Do you know right before it was over,
[01:48:49.748 --> 01:48:56.911]  They gave me that job in office maybe a week or two at the last minute after I had already walked five or six miles.
[01:48:56.911 --> 01:48:57.612]  Well, see, here's the thing.
[01:48:57.612 --> 01:48:58.752]  You're a really nice lady.
[01:48:58.752 --> 01:49:08.376]  The way you described it to me, tell folks, I mean, tell us how they called you in after the Obama phone video went viral.
[01:49:08.376 --> 01:49:11.218]  I mean, describe that because you told me last night.
[01:49:11.218 --> 01:49:15.740]  Okay, well, when I got the job that I was doing walking in the field service,
[01:49:16.601 --> 01:49:20.944]  They called me in the office and they was like, do you know how you showed your ass?
[01:49:20.944 --> 01:49:26.008]  You know how I really talked to the cameraman and I said what I said.
[01:49:26.008 --> 01:49:28.990]  And I said, I said the first thing came to my heart.
[01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:31.732]  And he was like, do you know that Obama didn't get the phone?
[01:49:31.732 --> 01:49:33.333]  It don't matter.
[01:49:33.333 --> 01:49:38.617]  People are walking around, even you, the job that I got, the phone you gave me, say Obama.
[01:49:41.058 --> 01:49:44.540]  If this is all what we see and know, this is what people think.
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:46.562]  And then you told me they put you in the office.
[01:49:46.562 --> 01:49:47.742]  They gave me an office job.
[01:49:47.742 --> 01:49:49.083]  So that you wouldn't be on the street?
[01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:50.564]  That I wouldn't be on the street.
[01:49:50.564 --> 01:49:52.326]  And then what did they tell you about that?
[01:49:52.326 --> 01:49:58.970]  Well, when I got an office job, they told me they didn't want me on the street because I had so many voters for Obama.
[01:49:58.970 --> 01:50:01.171]  You know, I was really going out there talking.
[01:50:01.171 --> 01:50:06.915]  They knew because at the end of the day, turning your paperwork, I got over 75 to 100 people.
[01:50:06.915 --> 01:50:10.618]  But do you really believe you did such a good job we pulled you off it?
[01:50:11.158 --> 01:50:11.719]  Right.
[01:50:11.719 --> 01:50:12.660]  But I don't believe that.
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:16.765]  I believe they pulled me off because he was full of stuff, too.
[01:50:16.765 --> 01:50:20.670]  Well, see, the difference is here with me, Michelle, is I'm talking to you straight.
[01:50:20.670 --> 01:50:21.131]  Right.
[01:50:21.131 --> 01:50:24.756]  See, I don't see you as a human resource to be used.
[01:50:24.756 --> 01:50:25.637]  Right.
[01:50:25.637 --> 01:50:27.519]  I see you as a real person.
[01:50:27.519 --> 01:50:27.739]  Mm-hmm.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:45.185]  Who has incredible potential, and I want you to know that I have Margaret Sanger in all the documents where they said about a hundred years ago, they said we're going to go in and take over the black community, we're going to hire their leaders, and we're going to get abortion legalized so we can kill these people.
[01:50:45.185 --> 01:50:48.126]  The Democratic Party exists to put you six feet under.
[01:50:49.579 --> 01:50:55.788]  The Republicans are a bunch of gangsters too, but the Democrats, a modern Democratic Party, is designed to kill black people.
[01:50:55.788 --> 01:50:57.090]  We'll be right back, okay?
[01:50:57.090 --> 01:50:57.851]  Alright.
[01:50:57.851 --> 01:50:58.853]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:16.635]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.
[01:51:16.635 --> 01:51:20.059]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[01:51:20.059 --> 01:51:23.523]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game.
[01:51:24.484 --> 01:51:25.785]  But it's not Africa.
[01:51:25.785 --> 01:51:27.345]  It's Argentina.
[01:51:27.345 --> 01:51:36.149]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, cougar, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America.
[01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:38.029]  All gold medal quality.
[01:51:38.029 --> 01:51:39.590]  All the action you can handle.
[01:51:41.092 --> 01:51:49.236]  Land Rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground transportation included and more.
[01:51:49.236 --> 01:51:52.178]  All more affordable than you can imagine.
[01:51:52.178 --> 01:51:57.321]  The adventure of a lifetime starts at GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[01:51:57.321 --> 01:51:59.402]  The big game hunting ranch.
[01:51:59.402 --> 01:52:01.203]  GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[01:52:05.405 --> 01:52:06.907]  I don't know.
[01:52:27.408 --> 01:52:28.269]  We're good to go!
[01:52:57.427 --> 01:52:58.572]  MindRegard.
[01:52:58.572 --> 01:53:00.601]  Clearly see tomorrow and yesterday today.
[01:53:02.665 --> 01:53:03.786]  My name is Stephen Heuer.
[01:53:03.786 --> 01:53:11.090]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.
[01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:23.137]  So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious matters like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.
[01:53:23.137 --> 01:53:27.940]  One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production.
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:33.042]  My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.
[01:53:33.042 --> 01:53:37.304]  I got him on One Real Way, and in two months his constipation is gone.
[01:53:37.304 --> 01:53:42.927]  He's become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he's made his first friend.
[01:53:42.927 --> 01:53:46.709]  He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One Real Way every day.
[01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:51.151]  You could offer him a present, or a cake, and he would prefer the One Real Way.
[01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:53.694]  Go to oneworldway.com.
[01:53:53.694 --> 01:53:56.438]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:53:56.438 --> 01:53:57.039]  Or call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:57.039 --> 01:53:57.299]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:54:10.162 --> 01:54:11.523]  You're the pretender.
[01:54:11.523 --> 01:54:12.543]  What have I say?
[01:54:12.543 --> 01:54:13.904]  I will never surrender.
[01:54:13.904 --> 01:54:21.688]  Folks, she's subdued right now, but during the break, she was her old Obama phone lady self.
[01:54:21.688 --> 01:54:23.389]  Michelle Dowery is here with us in the studio.
[01:54:23.389 --> 01:54:27.892]  A whole other hour coming up, and we will also open the phones up as well.
[01:54:29.266 --> 01:54:41.477]  But continuing here, I sent the guys over to McDonald's to get a Happy Meal because, and I don't do this to be condescending, I do this to get it all out in the open.
[01:54:41.477 --> 01:54:43.318]  Wow, that's where I've never seen a Happy Meal where it's torn open.
[01:54:43.318 --> 01:54:44.700]  My son must have been in this.
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:47.122]  See, it's designed to get kids to go after it.
[01:54:47.122 --> 01:54:49.964]  But it's the same thing with adults.
[01:54:49.964 --> 01:54:53.868]  A free phone, it's like Indians selling Manhattan
[01:54:54.977 --> 01:54:59.879]  For a box full of glass beads that didn't even cost, you know, half a pound.
[01:54:59.879 --> 01:55:02.461]  Or British sterling.
[01:55:02.461 --> 01:55:04.582]  It's selling your birthright for baubles.
[01:55:04.582 --> 01:55:08.464]  The government shouldn't be the place we're getting phones from.
[01:55:08.464 --> 01:55:11.865]  The government... Guys, I don't think that door is completely shut.
[01:55:11.865 --> 01:55:12.966]  Can we shut that door completely?
[01:55:12.966 --> 01:55:17.268]  Thank you.
[01:55:17.268 --> 01:55:20.650]  This is the type of issue that we're dealing with here and
[01:55:23.863 --> 01:55:25.663]  It is an artificial system.
[01:55:25.663 --> 01:55:34.965]  Not only is this meant to lure kids in, a bunch of GMO crud with Monsanto on the board of this organization.
[01:55:34.965 --> 01:55:38.646]  And it's a happy meal, but really what it is is a spider's web.
[01:55:38.646 --> 01:55:42.466]  So, here's my issue.
[01:55:42.466 --> 01:55:44.687]  That's the same thing with the Obama phone.
[01:55:44.687 --> 01:55:45.947]  It's like a happy meal.
[01:55:45.947 --> 01:55:49.527]  In fact, you've got the Obama phone right there, don't you?
[01:55:49.527 --> 01:55:49.967]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:49.967 --> 01:55:51.288]  It's like Excalibur.
[01:55:51.288 --> 01:55:52.828]  Hold it up for the camera so people can see that.
[01:55:53.672 --> 01:55:57.274]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:57.274 --> 01:56:05.618]  And again, just to be clear about this, the Republicans out there, half of them work for defense contractors, they're getting government money too.
[01:56:05.618 --> 01:56:08.980]  I'm not here judging you because you want an Obama phone.
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:10.420]  What about all the corporate welfare?
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:12.461]  What about the trillions in banker bailouts?
[01:56:12.461 --> 01:56:17.404]  Did you know for every dollar that went to banker bailouts, they had like one dollar in welfare?
[01:56:17.404 --> 01:56:21.566]  Again, if we are going to have a socialist system, the people are sure selling out cheap.
[01:56:23.427 --> 01:56:26.468]  Why didn't you like Romney?
[01:56:26.468 --> 01:56:29.109]  Romney was going to take the food stamps.
[01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:30.329]  He was going to take the stamps.
[01:56:30.329 --> 01:56:34.790]  He was going to make us work for the food stamps.
[01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:36.010]  What else he said he was going to do?
[01:56:36.010 --> 01:56:38.671]  He was going to cut our hours back.
[01:56:38.671 --> 01:56:41.732]  You know, in Ohio, they got the cameras.
[01:56:41.732 --> 01:56:45.073]  He was up on the camera with the speeding.
[01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:49.631]  Romney was really on it.
[01:56:49.631 --> 01:56:52.993]  I mean, Obama is continuing and expanding NSA spying.
[01:56:52.993 --> 01:56:59.837]  Obama has signed a law where they can secretly disappear American citizens and even kill us, called the NDAA.
[01:56:59.837 --> 01:57:01.719]  He's got drone attacks going on all over the world.
[01:57:01.719 --> 01:57:04.300]  Again, I'm not saying Romney's good either.
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:08.162]  My point is they're all really bad and Obama isn't your friend.
[01:57:08.162 --> 01:57:13.766]  What do you think of Obama continuing torture?
[01:57:13.766 --> 01:57:14.426]  What do I think?
[01:57:14.426 --> 01:57:15.787]  He's continuing to torture?
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:18.081]  Is that what you said?
[01:57:18.081 --> 01:57:22.784]  Yes, I mean, are you aware of his foreign policy?
[01:57:22.784 --> 01:57:24.526]  A little bit.
[01:57:24.526 --> 01:57:30.330]  My point is, is that, I mean, do you think torture is okay?
[01:57:30.330 --> 01:57:31.691]  No.
[01:57:31.691 --> 01:57:34.393]  What about, what about drone attacks?
[01:57:34.393 --> 01:57:35.054]  No.
[01:57:35.054 --> 01:57:38.717]  Where they're just bombing, and by the way, the countries where they're bombing, it's illegal.
[01:57:38.717 --> 01:57:43.801]  There's no declaration of war, they're just flying around killing whoever they want.
[01:57:43.801 --> 01:57:46.783]  Do you think Obama really cried on TV for the dead kids at Sandy Hook?
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:50.081]  No.
[01:57:50.081 --> 01:57:50.802]  You think it was fake?
[01:57:50.802 --> 01:57:54.685]  A little bit.
[01:57:54.685 --> 01:57:56.006]  I mean, he gotta play his part.
[01:57:56.006 --> 01:57:57.387]  He's the president.
[01:57:57.387 --> 01:58:02.931]  I mean, if he goes out and cry to every little situation, hell, he wouldn't have no tears left.
[01:58:02.931 --> 01:58:03.972]  You know?
[01:58:03.972 --> 01:58:06.294]  He gotta play his part, too.
[01:58:06.294 --> 01:58:09.656]  The whole world is a stage, each of us players upon it?
[01:58:09.656 --> 01:58:10.577]  No.
[01:58:10.577 --> 01:58:12.319]  I'm not gonna agree on that one.
[01:58:12.319 --> 01:58:14.861]  But you're saying, here's the deal, I don't play my part.
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:18.341]  I mean, if I cry, I really am crying.
[01:58:18.341 --> 01:58:23.643]  My point is, they'll kill hundreds of innocent people at a wedding to get one bad guy, they claim.
[01:58:23.643 --> 01:58:25.924]  And Obama doesn't cry for all those little kids.
[01:58:25.924 --> 01:58:32.407]  Have you seen the video of little kids in Libya and Syria with their lower jaws blown off and stuff, screaming for mommy?
[01:58:32.407 --> 01:58:33.628]  Why isn't Obama crying for them?
[01:58:33.628 --> 01:58:37.309]  Well, he probably felt sad and moved on.
[01:58:37.309 --> 01:58:38.890]  But I think he could have did more.
[01:58:38.890 --> 01:58:40.370]  Well, he is doing more.
[01:58:40.370 --> 01:58:41.171]  He's bombing more countries.
[01:58:43.737 --> 01:58:47.287]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:25.119 --> 02:00:28.602]  I thought it would be fun to get the Obama phone lady in studio.
[02:00:28.602 --> 02:00:29.763]  No one knew who she was.
[02:00:29.763 --> 02:00:32.044]  There was that one video.
[02:00:32.044 --> 02:00:35.447]  Then, she disappeared off the radar screen.
[02:00:36.874 --> 02:00:39.136]  Well, she's now down here with us in Austin, Texas.
[02:00:39.136 --> 02:00:40.958]  We had a great time last night.
[02:00:40.958 --> 02:00:43.801]  I don't want to say you're nervous, but you're real serious now.
[02:00:43.801 --> 02:00:45.923]  During the break, she's been having a little bit more fun.
[02:00:45.923 --> 02:00:47.425]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[02:00:47.425 --> 02:00:53.310]  I want to go to a bunch of Twitter questions, a big stack of them that have also come in here.
[02:00:53.310 --> 02:00:56.974]  And I've got a bunch of other points I want to go over with you here today.
[02:01:00.168 --> 02:01:05.792]  You were talking about, you know, the hope that Obama will do things that will make your life and other people's lives better.
[02:01:05.792 --> 02:01:08.294]  There's certainly nothing wrong with wanting a better life.
[02:01:08.294 --> 02:01:10.916]  What do you think Obama can do?
[02:01:10.916 --> 02:01:12.457]  He can do anything he want to do.
[02:01:12.457 --> 02:01:13.398]  He's the President.
[02:01:13.398 --> 02:01:16.700]  It might take a little time, but, you know, he can do anything.
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:17.581]  The President?
[02:01:17.581 --> 02:01:21.424]  If he wanted to build me a house from the ground, he could do that.
[02:01:23.137 --> 02:01:24.157]  He's the president.
[02:01:24.157 --> 02:01:27.338]  But he would have to take it from somebody else to do it.
[02:01:27.338 --> 02:01:27.658]  Right.
[02:01:27.658 --> 02:01:29.139]  That's like anybody else.
[02:01:29.139 --> 02:01:31.199]  And then he would have to choose who got to build it.
[02:01:31.199 --> 02:01:32.420]  Of course, that'll be his friends.
[02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:33.260]  But that's okay.
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:34.160]  He's the president.
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:36.321]  He got that pool to do whatever he can do.
[02:01:36.321 --> 02:01:37.781]  They got that Obama phone.
[02:01:37.781 --> 02:01:39.882]  Go ahead and take it.
[02:01:39.882 --> 02:01:40.382]  Alright there.
[02:01:40.382 --> 02:01:43.083]  Hello?
[02:01:43.083 --> 02:01:43.663]  I'm on the air.
[02:01:43.663 --> 02:01:45.063]  I can't talk to you guys.
[02:01:45.063 --> 02:01:45.963]  My minutes are up.
[02:01:45.963 --> 02:01:49.204]  My Obama phone.
[02:01:49.204 --> 02:01:49.645]  Continue.
[02:01:51.653 --> 02:01:57.936]  Don't you get that kings and presidents and others would say, just do it before, and it's called tyranny.
[02:01:57.936 --> 02:02:01.078]  I mean, there's got to be rules that the president just can't do whatever he wants.
[02:02:01.078 --> 02:02:02.599]  That's true.
[02:02:02.599 --> 02:02:03.459]  He's the president.
[02:02:03.459 --> 02:02:07.981]  He can't do everything he wants to do, but, you know.
[02:02:07.981 --> 02:02:09.082]  Did you see all the people?
[02:02:09.082 --> 02:02:09.862]  We'll talk about it later.
[02:02:09.862 --> 02:02:11.483]  Let's take some phone calls right now.
[02:02:11.483 --> 02:02:16.566]  Ryan in Texas, you are on the phone with the real live Obama phone lady.
[02:02:16.566 --> 02:02:16.886]  Go ahead.
[02:02:19.103 --> 02:02:26.829]  I was wanting to really know what deep down made you support Obama.
[02:02:26.829 --> 02:02:29.251]  Deep down, why does she support Obama?
[02:02:29.251 --> 02:02:33.814]  Yeah, it's like the core reason why I like to make sure I support Obama.
[02:02:33.814 --> 02:02:36.837]  I mean, is it reflected, Glory?
[02:02:36.837 --> 02:02:40.019]  Is it that you feel like you're part of something?
[02:02:40.939 --> 02:02:43.561]  No, I didn't feel like I was part of anything.
[02:02:43.561 --> 02:02:45.301]  I had a job to do.
[02:02:45.301 --> 02:02:46.522]  Like now I got a job.
[02:02:46.522 --> 02:02:48.863]  I was making, I'm making a little money.
[02:02:48.863 --> 02:02:52.645]  And when I did the campaign for Obama, I made the big money.
[02:02:52.645 --> 02:03:00.170]  But as I was out there campaigning to get voters to vote for Obama, you know, one thing I pressed was,
[02:03:01.050 --> 02:03:02.451]  What kind of phone you got?
[02:03:02.451 --> 02:03:03.771]  And it was like Obama phone.
[02:03:03.771 --> 02:03:04.991]  How you get it?
[02:03:04.991 --> 02:03:06.732]  They didn't know like I didn't know.
[02:03:06.732 --> 02:03:11.974]  So that was cross, that was wrong led me to get them out there for the vote.
[02:03:11.974 --> 02:03:17.216]  But if you really look at it, if you got a quarter, you ain't saying where the quarter come from, it's just a quarter.
[02:03:17.216 --> 02:03:19.016]  Just like the phones, they were free.
[02:03:19.016 --> 02:03:19.676]  No, I understand.
[02:03:19.676 --> 02:03:20.477]  It's Pavlovian.
[02:03:20.477 --> 02:03:25.178]  I mean, the government is giving you something, therefore it must be good.
[02:03:25.178 --> 02:03:27.239]  But take your job you've got now.
[02:03:27.239 --> 02:03:29.540]  Did you know the payroll taxes just went way up?
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.581]  The amount of money they're taking out of your check?
[02:03:31.581 --> 02:03:34.443]  Remember Obama said he wouldn't raise your taxes.
[02:03:34.443 --> 02:03:35.103]  No, I didn't.
[02:03:35.103 --> 02:03:37.564]  I haven't got a check yet.
[02:03:37.564 --> 02:03:50.152]  Well, listen, we're going to have to try to work this out, because I'd like you to do some auxiliary reporting for us, but I first have to get you to the point where you understand... I mean, everybody's heard about government doing medical experiments on people.
[02:03:50.152 --> 02:03:53.034]  Caller, did you have anything else you wanted to add?
[02:03:53.034 --> 02:03:58.397]  Yeah, I was also wanting to know her views on the gun control bill they're trying to pass.
[02:04:00.225 --> 02:04:05.548]  I'm going to ask her that when we come back from break, because that's a big one, and I want everybody to be able to respond to that.
[02:04:05.548 --> 02:04:07.950]  When we come back from break, we'll get into the gun situation.
[02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:09.190]  I asked her about that last night.
[02:04:09.190 --> 02:04:11.252]  And we'll get to some of these Twitter questions as well.
[02:04:11.252 --> 02:04:12.632]  Thank you for the call, Ryan.
[02:04:12.632 --> 02:04:16.735]  We're going to go to Jerry and others also on the other side of this quick break.
[02:04:16.735 --> 02:04:18.216]  And she's with us.
[02:04:18.216 --> 02:04:23.479]  Michelle Dowery is in studio with us, and she is the Obamaphone lady.
[02:04:24.179 --> 02:04:28.600]  And if you want to see the quintessential Obama voter, I think she represents it.
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:39.923]  She's a nice lady, and I understand that this country's in a depression, and you get to a point where, you know, the government is there providing for you, you start having allegiance for it.
[02:04:39.923 --> 02:04:46.124]  So pretty soon the government takes from one group, gives to another, they've got them at a subsistence level, there's no real economy left,
[02:04:46.664 --> 02:04:50.129]  Everybody's on the government plantation, and game over, the globalists win.
[02:04:50.129 --> 02:04:53.072]  We'll come right back with the one, the only, the Obamaphone lady.
[02:04:53.072 --> 02:04:55.355]  It's very, very somber in here.
[02:04:55.355 --> 02:04:57.037]  We've got a lot of video of her behind the scenes.
[02:04:57.037 --> 02:04:58.359]  She's a crackerjack.
[02:04:58.359 --> 02:04:58.940]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:03.155 --> 02:05:08.658]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:05:08.658 --> 02:05:11.060]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:20.165]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:20.165 --> 02:05:23.607]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[02:05:31.132 --> 02:05:32.652]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:05:32.652 --> 02:05:34.093]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:05:34.093 --> 02:05:37.253]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:05:37.253 --> 02:05:40.634]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:05:40.634 --> 02:05:44.775]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:05:44.775 --> 02:05:47.495]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:05:47.495 --> 02:05:49.075]  It's what my family uses.
[02:05:49.075 --> 02:05:52.396]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[02:07:07.037 --> 02:07:08.298]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:08.298 --> 02:07:12.160]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:14.621]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:14.621 --> 02:07:20.325]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:20.325 --> 02:07:26.988]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:26.988 --> 02:07:32.972]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:32.972 --> 02:07:36.674]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:07:37.134 --> 02:07:41.436]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:41.436 --> 02:07:47.378]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:47.378 --> 02:07:50.919]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:50.919 --> 02:07:52.900]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:54.020]  It's here.
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:08:00.823]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:05.973 --> 02:08:09.578]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:09.578 --> 02:08:13.723]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:23.237 --> 02:08:25.419]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[02:08:25.419 --> 02:08:26.479]  Let's talk about it.
[02:08:44.632 --> 02:08:49.376]  Okay, we're here with the real live Obama phone lady, and now her name is revealed.
[02:08:49.376 --> 02:08:50.557]  She's that mystery person.
[02:08:50.557 --> 02:08:52.299]  I'm like, I want that lady on.
[02:08:52.299 --> 02:08:53.059]  What's her name?
[02:08:53.059 --> 02:08:54.000]  Let's find her.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.722]  And our listeners found her.
[02:08:55.722 --> 02:08:57.583]  Now, she's since been called by The View.
[02:08:57.583 --> 02:09:01.026]  She's reportedly going to go on that soon, and a bunch of other stations.
[02:09:01.026 --> 02:09:02.588]  But she's here first with us.
[02:09:04.449 --> 02:09:05.770]  She's a little subdued today.
[02:09:05.770 --> 02:09:09.232]  I think we had a few too many beers last night.
[02:09:09.232 --> 02:09:09.733]  I'm joking.
[02:09:09.733 --> 02:09:10.233]  I'm joking.
[02:09:10.233 --> 02:09:11.714]  We didn't know actually we did.
[02:09:11.714 --> 02:09:15.436]  Anyways, but she's going to be on the nightly news with us tonight as well.
[02:09:15.436 --> 02:09:17.217]  And I want to go back to your calls.
[02:09:17.217 --> 02:09:18.818]  I want to go over a whole bunch of issues.
[02:09:18.818 --> 02:09:22.481]  I want to take your Twitter questions here today.
[02:09:22.481 --> 02:09:25.843]  But you heard the last caller, but we were going to break.
[02:09:25.843 --> 02:09:28.645]  Where do you stand on the right to keep and bear arms?
[02:09:32.608 --> 02:09:36.129]  You're not Ella Perry Mason up on the courtroom.
[02:09:36.129 --> 02:09:39.150]  We just want to know where you come from.
[02:09:39.150 --> 02:09:40.571]  Where do you stand on the Second Amendment?
[02:09:40.571 --> 02:09:43.551]  Where do you stand on the right to own guns?
[02:09:43.551 --> 02:09:45.212]  I'm against that.
[02:09:45.212 --> 02:09:45.932]  There you go.
[02:09:45.932 --> 02:09:51.634]  So you want the government to have guns but not the people?
[02:09:51.634 --> 02:09:53.295]  No guns at all.
[02:09:53.295 --> 02:09:54.275]  Have faith in God.
[02:09:55.516 --> 02:09:58.297]  Well, God has faith in those that have faith in themselves.
[02:09:58.297 --> 02:10:06.001]  See, I mean... I'm not into the guns, you know, and to me it's a lot of nonsense with that.
[02:10:06.001 --> 02:10:08.422]  I'm not into guns with the government having them.
[02:10:08.422 --> 02:10:08.982]  No.
[02:10:08.982 --> 02:10:15.305]  I mean, the government has bought 1.6 billion bullets, armored vehicles, helicopters, SWAT teams.
[02:10:15.305 --> 02:10:21.448]  A SWAT team bust in and shot an innocent guy 16 times, and they said it was justified
[02:10:22.248 --> 02:10:26.771]  Because he was reaching to turn the light on, and they lied and said he had four guns, which he didn't.
[02:10:26.771 --> 02:10:30.853]  Even though they got caught lying, because it's about officer safety.
[02:10:30.853 --> 02:10:31.694]  So I got an idea.
[02:10:31.694 --> 02:10:34.735]  How about everyone on earth but police commit suicide?
[02:10:34.735 --> 02:10:42.260]  6 billion, 300 million people commit suicide, but the 15 million police or so worldwide, for their safety.
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:45.501]  Because if they say, if they think it's their safety, they kill you?
[02:10:45.501 --> 02:10:47.823]  How about everyone on earth commit suicide so they're safe?
[02:10:49.838 --> 02:10:50.998]  That's what the New World Order wants.
[02:10:50.998 --> 02:10:59.522]  They want to have world government to set up a medical tyranny to force cancer virus injections into us via vaccines and GMO they force-feed us.
[02:10:59.522 --> 02:11:03.283]  And these globalists think we're so dumb, Michelle, they've written books how they're doing it to us.
[02:11:05.353 --> 02:11:07.655]  Do you know about Tuskegee?
[02:11:07.655 --> 02:11:12.539]  Why do you trust a government that you know nerve gas for our own troops?
[02:11:12.539 --> 02:11:21.026]  Did you hear about in New York City how they were giving little kids, mainly black kids, because the government loves black kids so much, wants to give you free stuff.
[02:11:21.026 --> 02:11:22.187]  No, they're not your friends.
[02:11:22.187 --> 02:11:23.788]  I'm trying to really reach out to you here.
[02:11:23.788 --> 02:11:26.250]  And I understand they've shut the economy down.
[02:11:26.250 --> 02:11:27.451]  I understand things are desperate.
[02:11:27.451 --> 02:11:29.012]  I get all that.
[02:11:29.012 --> 02:11:29.773]  I understand that.
[02:11:30.453 --> 02:11:39.980]  And what I'm saying is, the New York Daily News six years ago reported they were testing pesticides on little kids until they killed them.
[02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:42.742]  Now see, I happen to care about those kids no matter what color they are.
[02:11:42.742 --> 02:11:44.484]  They happen to be mainly black.
[02:11:44.484 --> 02:11:47.726]  Because for some reason, in the liberal intelligentsia, it's okay.
[02:11:47.726 --> 02:11:49.648]  But some of the CPS workers blew the whistle.
[02:11:50.572 --> 02:11:52.773]  And said, you know, these kids are dying.
[02:11:52.773 --> 02:11:54.174]  Is this okay?
[02:11:54.174 --> 02:11:55.675]  Should we be killing them?
[02:11:55.675 --> 02:11:56.496]  Because we're the government.
[02:11:56.496 --> 02:12:01.539]  I mean, is it okay for the government to chain little black kids down and feed pesticides to them?
[02:12:01.539 --> 02:12:02.079]  No.
[02:12:02.079 --> 02:12:03.701]  Bug poison?
[02:12:03.701 --> 02:12:03.881]  No.
[02:12:03.881 --> 02:12:07.263]  Now, I mean, I can show you all these articles.
[02:12:07.263 --> 02:12:09.504]  Now, does that sound like a nice group of people there?
[02:12:09.504 --> 02:12:10.305]  No.
[02:12:10.305 --> 02:12:12.986]  Okay.
[02:12:12.986 --> 02:12:18.610]  You told me, you and Harvey told me why you want the guns taken last night, and I understand it.
[02:12:18.610 --> 02:12:19.791]  Why don't you repeat what you said?
[02:12:23.157 --> 02:12:28.962]  Well, I don't want the guns for the President to get them.
[02:12:28.962 --> 02:12:36.289]  The people out here, you can buy guns on the street, you can buy them from police officers, you know.
[02:12:36.289 --> 02:12:38.471]  Yeah, I know, that's where you go to get drugs and everything, the police, yeah.
[02:12:38.471 --> 02:12:40.192]  Right, right, right, right.
[02:12:40.192 --> 02:12:46.138]  And just by me being on your talk show and thinking about it, them are the biggest cruel people there is.
[02:12:46.778 --> 02:12:47.939]  You know?
[02:12:47.939 --> 02:12:50.782]  Just by you saying about, um, the guns.
[02:12:50.782 --> 02:12:51.703]  You know, they go buy it.
[02:12:51.703 --> 02:12:56.749]  The President got all these guns and protect them, but what about the people that help you protect us?
[02:12:56.749 --> 02:12:58.050]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:12:58.050 --> 02:13:03.976]  I've talked to people at MTV, multiple people, who said in the mid-90s, they said, we're going to promote this gangster rap.
[02:13:04.557 --> 02:13:05.958]  To take over the culture.
[02:13:05.958 --> 02:13:07.398]  That's a time bomb.
[02:13:07.398 --> 02:13:08.779]  And the rappers are killing each other.
[02:13:08.779 --> 02:13:12.580]  They'll have $50 million in the bank, but to be a man, they'll shoot somebody.
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:15.022]  I get, because that's what Harvey, your husband, was saying.
[02:13:15.022 --> 02:13:17.242]  He goes, look, I've had, you know, nephews killed.
[02:13:17.242 --> 02:13:19.543]  I get that that's terrible and horrible.
[02:13:19.543 --> 02:13:26.166]  And there's a lot of rappers like KRS-One, who's one of my listeners, and others, and Professor Griff, who are saying that's wrong.
[02:13:26.166 --> 02:13:26.827]  And you know what?
[02:13:26.827 --> 02:13:29.388]  It is a program for blacks to kill each other.
[02:13:29.388 --> 02:13:31.989]  So I'm against that inner-city violence.
[02:13:33.137 --> 02:13:37.958]  Believe me, but that isn't a reason for everybody else to lose their guns.
[02:13:37.958 --> 02:13:38.738]  Take Chicago.
[02:13:38.738 --> 02:13:40.159]  You know they have the highest crime rate in the world?
[02:13:40.159 --> 02:13:40.699]  Right.
[02:13:40.699 --> 02:13:41.819]  We're on the radio in Chicago.
[02:13:41.819 --> 02:13:43.439]  That's not for them.
[02:13:43.439 --> 02:13:43.859]  You're right.
[02:13:43.859 --> 02:13:46.060]  But they've taken the guns there.
[02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:49.841]  Only law-abiding citizens then gave their guns up.
[02:13:49.841 --> 02:13:54.782]  So see, if I could walk through with Obama supporters, and it doesn't mean you go vote for Romney.
[02:13:54.782 --> 02:13:56.162]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[02:13:56.162 --> 02:13:59.263]  Did you know the very same interest fund both men?
[02:13:59.263 --> 02:14:00.243]  Yeah, I knew that.
[02:14:01.431 --> 02:14:03.615]  But then Obama, he is charming.
[02:14:03.615 --> 02:14:06.259]  He's like, hey, I'm going to take care of you.
[02:14:06.259 --> 02:14:09.204]  Did you see in the first campaign people going, oh, thank you, Mr. President.
[02:14:09.204 --> 02:14:10.086]  I'm going to get a free house.
[02:14:10.086 --> 02:14:10.987]  I'm going to get a free car.
[02:14:10.987 --> 02:14:11.188]  Right.
[02:14:12.659 --> 02:14:14.761]  And those people did not get free houses and free cars.
[02:14:14.761 --> 02:14:16.822]  He didn't do nothing for Lee and Harvard.
[02:14:16.822 --> 02:14:21.026]  He promised them people he was gonna get a big office if he win this time.
[02:14:21.026 --> 02:14:29.373]  You know, you heard him on the news say how he come back to Cleveland and Detroit and get us low black minorities to vote.
[02:14:29.373 --> 02:14:31.274]  But look how we living.
[02:14:31.274 --> 02:14:35.478]  You know, Lee and Harvard and Cleveland, Ohio, still where his office at, it's still the same.
[02:14:35.478 --> 02:14:39.421]  Well, I mean, and again, Obama said, I will not sign the NDAA.
[02:14:39.421 --> 02:14:40.482]  Don't worry about beating it.
[02:14:41.533 --> 02:14:43.355]  Because there was opposition, it was gonna get beaten.
[02:14:43.355 --> 02:14:44.777]  He said, but I'm gonna veto it.
[02:14:44.777 --> 02:14:46.299]  So people said, well just let it pass.
[02:14:46.299 --> 02:14:46.439]  Right.
[02:14:46.439 --> 02:14:47.620]  Then he signed it.
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:48.161]  Right.
[02:14:48.161 --> 02:14:50.464]  So he went against our word and signed it anyway.
[02:14:50.464 --> 02:14:51.965]  But the point is, it turned out he wrote it.
[02:14:53.618 --> 02:14:57.861]  I mean, this guy makes, it's devilish lying.
[02:14:57.861 --> 02:15:00.303]  Okay, and Romney's a devilish liar too.
[02:15:00.303 --> 02:15:05.588]  The point is, is that it's how far gone we are, Michelle, is why things are getting worse and worse.
[02:15:05.588 --> 02:15:07.309]  Let me play you a clip here.
[02:15:07.309 --> 02:15:11.072]  This is Obama saying, your payroll tax, nothing's going up.
[02:15:11.072 --> 02:15:14.655]  But you know, more than 14 taxes are going up.
[02:15:14.655 --> 02:15:17.337]  And there's a 3.8% tax on investments.
[02:15:17.337 --> 02:15:19.198]  There's another tax on payroll.
[02:15:19.198 --> 02:15:20.900]  There's taxes across the board.
[02:15:22.295 --> 02:15:22.655]  Thank you, now.
[02:15:47.093 --> 02:15:48.393]  Gave it back.
[02:15:48.393 --> 02:15:49.834]  Tax receipts doubled.
[02:15:49.834 --> 02:15:57.095]  Did you know the government knows if they cut taxes, there's a boom and that more money comes in?
[02:15:57.095 --> 02:16:00.216]  Michelle, why would they want to raise taxes?
[02:16:00.216 --> 02:16:00.856]  I don't know.
[02:16:00.856 --> 02:16:04.777]  Why would they want to chain kids down and dump pesticide down their throat?
[02:16:04.777 --> 02:16:06.558]  I don't know.
[02:16:06.558 --> 02:16:11.639]  See, did you see that news article about the top BBC presenter being a satanist with kids?
[02:16:11.639 --> 02:16:12.059]  Yeah.
[02:16:12.059 --> 02:16:14.360]  Why would he want to do that to little kids?
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:15.280]  He's a satanist, that's why.
[02:16:17.659 --> 02:16:20.541]  And see, the devil comes as an angel of light.
[02:16:20.541 --> 02:16:23.102]  It's true, that's in the Bible.
[02:16:23.102 --> 02:16:26.344]  And will speak scripture.
[02:16:26.344 --> 02:16:30.407]  This government is the most evil government the world has ever seen.
[02:16:30.407 --> 02:16:33.328]  Our government funded Hitler.
[02:16:33.328 --> 02:16:35.430]  And then destroyed him.
[02:16:35.430 --> 02:16:38.552]  Our government created Lenin and Stalin.
[02:16:38.552 --> 02:16:39.892]  Did you know that's declassified?
[02:16:39.892 --> 02:16:41.773]  Did you know our government put Mao Zedong in?
[02:16:41.773 --> 02:16:42.394]  Declassified.
[02:16:44.614 --> 02:16:49.437]  Mao Zedong conservatively killed 66 million people.
[02:16:49.437 --> 02:16:52.079]  The Chinese government says 80 plus million.
[02:16:52.079 --> 02:16:53.060]  You know how many people that is?
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:54.921]  A sports stadium's 100,000.
[02:16:54.921 --> 02:16:57.583]  That's almost more or over.
[02:16:57.583 --> 02:17:00.185]  140, you got.
[02:17:00.185 --> 02:17:00.806]  Yeah, 100,000 people.
[02:17:00.806 --> 02:17:05.849]  How many sports stadiums is 80 million people?
[02:17:05.849 --> 02:17:06.870]  Two, three.
[02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:08.911]  Starved to death, lined up and shot.
[02:17:08.911 --> 02:17:12.434]  You know, our government shipped in shiploads of bullets, so you just mow them down.
[02:17:15.879 --> 02:17:17.360]  It's not our government.
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:20.101]  They're called eugenicists.
[02:17:20.101 --> 02:17:20.882]  Eugenicists.
[02:17:20.882 --> 02:17:23.143]  They're scientific dictators.
[02:17:23.143 --> 02:17:26.585]  Obama is reading off a teleprompter.
[02:17:26.585 --> 02:17:30.628]  And we've got to realize that the entire system is evil.
[02:17:30.628 --> 02:17:31.848]  And I don't want to sit here and preach at you.
[02:17:31.848 --> 02:17:33.169]  Let's play this first clip.
[02:17:33.169 --> 02:17:37.852]  This is Obama four years ago saying, I will never raise your taxes, not one dollar.
[02:17:37.852 --> 02:17:39.613]  Here it is.
[02:17:39.613 --> 02:17:45.116]  And I can make a firm pledge under my plan, no family making
[02:17:45.971 --> 02:17:51.513]  Less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.
[02:17:51.513 --> 02:17:59.456]  Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.
[02:17:59.456 --> 02:18:00.957]  That's a firm pledge.
[02:18:00.957 --> 02:18:05.098]  Now, guys, just because he's here, I know I've only got two guys here in the job, eight people.
[02:18:05.098 --> 02:18:09.860]  Will somebody just type in, 77% of Americans got payroll tax increase?
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:10.681]  People making $30,000 or up.
[02:18:10.681 --> 02:18:10.881]  Now, is $30,000 $250,000?
[02:18:16.072 --> 02:18:17.373]  Is that a lie right there?
[02:18:17.373 --> 02:18:18.173]  That's a lie.
[02:18:18.173 --> 02:18:22.355]  George Herbert Walker Bush got thrown out of office for reading my lips, no new taxes.
[02:18:22.355 --> 02:18:24.176]  People tell me now, well they just lie, that's what they do.
[02:18:24.176 --> 02:18:28.098]  Well, I know they're liars, so I'm not going to turn my guns in.
[02:18:28.098 --> 02:18:30.059]  Let's go to the next clip here for you.
[02:18:30.059 --> 02:18:31.040]  Let's play this clip.
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:35.442]  This is him four years ago saying, I'm not coming after your handgun or your rifle or your shotgun.
[02:18:35.442 --> 02:18:37.283]  Here's that clip.
[02:18:37.283 --> 02:18:43.326]  When y'all go home and you're talking to your buddies and they say, ah, he wants to take my gun away.
[02:18:43.326 --> 02:18:45.687]  You've heard it here, I'm on television so everybody knows it.
[02:18:47.458 --> 02:18:50.221]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[02:18:50.221 --> 02:18:54.284]  I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.
[02:18:54.284 --> 02:18:56.606]  I will not take your shotgun away.
[02:18:56.606 --> 02:19:00.029]  I will not take your rifle away.
[02:19:00.029 --> 02:19:02.392]  I won't take your handgun away.
[02:19:02.392 --> 02:19:04.614]  Okay, um, what does the devil do?
[02:19:06.004 --> 02:19:07.104]  What does the devil do?
[02:19:07.104 --> 02:19:08.545]  The devil lies.
[02:19:08.545 --> 02:19:09.485]  Lies, cheats.
[02:19:09.485 --> 02:19:11.285]  What's the devil's number one name in the Bible?
[02:19:11.285 --> 02:19:12.706]  The deceiver.
[02:19:12.706 --> 02:19:13.526]  The deceiver.
[02:19:13.526 --> 02:19:14.526]  The deceiver.
[02:19:14.526 --> 02:19:16.267]  The deceiver.
[02:19:16.267 --> 02:19:17.187]  The enemy.
[02:19:17.187 --> 02:19:20.148]  The enemy.
[02:19:20.148 --> 02:19:22.748]  I know a deceiver and an enemy when I see one.
[02:19:22.748 --> 02:19:25.369]  Now, if he just pledged to me, he wouldn't come after my guns.
[02:19:25.369 --> 02:19:31.810]  Now they got bills he supports that will make me hand in all my semi-autos, my handguns.
[02:19:31.810 --> 02:19:32.971]  Yep.
[02:19:32.971 --> 02:19:33.371]  He lied.
[02:19:34.574 --> 02:19:37.095]  And here's what's even worse, Michelle.
[02:19:37.095 --> 02:19:40.737]  They've all written papers in our public saying they want all our guns taken.
[02:19:40.737 --> 02:19:44.318]  And then Piers Morgan sits there and says, nobody wants your guns.
[02:19:44.318 --> 02:19:45.179]  That makes me mad.
[02:19:45.179 --> 02:19:49.440]  He's lying to my face.
[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:55.783]  Michelle, I'm going to give you some films covering eugenics and what they're really doing, and then we're going to have you back on.
[02:19:55.783 --> 02:20:00.645]  But when we come back, we're going to take more calls, get to more questions and more lies with Obama Phone Lady.
[02:20:00.645 --> 02:20:01.306]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:03.447 --> 02:20:04.888]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:04.888 --> 02:20:15.533]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:20:15.533 --> 02:20:19.635]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.

[02:20:37.509 --> 02:20:43.653]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:43.653 --> 02:20:53.538]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:20:53.538 --> 02:20:55.059]  The war is here.
[02:20:55.059 --> 02:20:56.940]  It's an info war.
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:59.662]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:03.524 --> 02:21:05.085]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:21:05.085 --> 02:21:11.187]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[02:21:11.187 --> 02:21:16.568]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E.M.

[02:21:27.552 --> 02:21:37.599]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[02:22:01.376 --> 02:22:02.898]  Life's getting better!
[02:22:02.898 --> 02:22:09.584]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:09.584 --> 02:22:17.331]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:17.691 --> 02:22:25.854]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:25.854 --> 02:22:30.956]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:30.956 --> 02:22:36.178]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:36.178 --> 02:22:39.899]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:40.519 --> 02:22:41.600]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:46.104]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:46.104 --> 02:22:51.008]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:51.008 --> 02:22:54.010]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:54.010 --> 02:22:55.752]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.752 --> 02:22:56.012]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:02.017 --> 02:23:02.998]  Hi there.
[02:23:02.998 --> 02:23:04.539]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:23:04.539 --> 02:23:08.381]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:23:08.381 --> 02:23:17.527]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:23:17.527 --> 02:23:24.232]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:23:24.232 --> 02:23:26.433]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:23:26.433 --> 02:23:31.517]  Others have called it a coverup and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:23:32.277 --> 02:23:40.221]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:23:40.221 --> 02:23:45.804]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[02:23:45.804 --> 02:23:52.307]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:23:52.307 --> 02:23:58.090]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:23:58.090 --> 02:23:59.250]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:24:17.170 --> 02:24:17.750]  She's here.
[02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:18.711]  She's the Obama lady.
[02:24:18.711 --> 02:24:23.892]  I promise we're going to your calls here in just a moment and a bunch of your tweet questions.
[02:24:23.892 --> 02:24:27.033]  But look, we're getting right down to the bottom of it here.
[02:24:27.033 --> 02:24:33.215]  You know the government's corrupt and bad, and so you're like, oh, there's all this emotion about the poor kids.
[02:24:33.215 --> 02:24:34.536]  Yeah, let's turn our guns in.
[02:24:34.536 --> 02:24:37.757]  Then you start thinking about, hey, who's really running things?
[02:24:37.757 --> 02:24:40.077]  Is it good to have only the government with guns?
[02:24:40.077 --> 02:24:41.778]  And then it sounds like you're starting to agree with me.
[02:24:42.618 --> 02:24:49.423]  Well, that I learned and found out, and you showed me in paperwork and on TV what he said.
[02:24:49.423 --> 02:24:52.125]  You know, I don't put nothing past anybody.
[02:24:52.125 --> 02:25:03.253]  I've been a mother of five kids, single mother, and they told me if I sign my name, they're going to give me so much of food stamps, so much of cash.
[02:25:03.253 --> 02:25:07.195]  But then they put me on a budget and say, this is it.
[02:25:07.195 --> 02:25:10.878]  If the rent's 600 and you're only giving me 300, how I'm going to make it?
[02:25:11.857 --> 02:25:13.357]  With five kids.
[02:25:13.357 --> 02:25:19.679]  But see, that's the end of humanity, where they break up our families and the state pays for things and they control everything.
[02:25:19.679 --> 02:25:24.500]  Well, you got a point there, because I'm a living example right now.
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:31.561]  When I lost that job... Peace, fella, it's okay.
[02:25:31.561 --> 02:25:33.421]  Guys, come help her, please.
[02:25:33.421 --> 02:25:36.722]  She had it off and then I put it back in and I don't really know how to do it.
[02:25:36.722 --> 02:25:38.982]  Well, here I go.
[02:25:38.982 --> 02:25:40.903]  He's gonna help you, go ahead.
[02:25:40.903 --> 02:25:41.463]  It's good radio.
[02:25:42.915 --> 02:25:44.576]  By the way, you're wound up during the breaks.
[02:25:44.576 --> 02:25:45.216]  Just be yourself.
[02:25:45.216 --> 02:25:45.916]  Go ahead.
[02:25:45.916 --> 02:25:48.257]  I'm not telling you to be wound up, but you're wound up normally.
[02:25:48.257 --> 02:25:49.798]  It's not like you're in a courtroom or something.
[02:25:49.798 --> 02:25:50.638]  Go ahead.
[02:25:50.638 --> 02:25:52.559]  Well, see, like I was saying, I don't hear anything.
[02:25:52.559 --> 02:25:54.820]  That's because we're not taking calls right now.
[02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:55.300]  Go ahead.
[02:25:55.300 --> 02:26:02.983]  Well, see, like I was saying, listening to Alex Jones, and he's telling me, and I've seen it on the news, that's true.
[02:26:02.983 --> 02:26:06.224]  Because those people wired me up to work for $11 an hour.
[02:26:08.613 --> 02:26:11.115]  And for a couple months and then they threw me out the door.
[02:26:11.115 --> 02:26:14.577]  They got what they wanted from me and you're off.
[02:26:14.577 --> 02:26:22.923]  And that's true because even when I got a paycheck, I went to the boss and I said, you mean I worked and you didn't take out any taxes?
[02:26:22.923 --> 02:26:24.063]  Now how could you do that?
[02:26:24.063 --> 02:26:25.604]  Because I'm working for Obama.
[02:26:25.604 --> 02:26:29.187]  He should get the same privileges I'm working for.
[02:26:29.187 --> 02:26:32.089]  Well, you're a contractor is why it happened.
[02:26:32.089 --> 02:26:37.032]  But I've noticed with the Obama folks, they won't even give people the tax forms because they're above the law.
[02:26:38.476 --> 02:26:39.737]  Well, we didn't get a tax form.
[02:26:39.737 --> 02:26:41.278]  They didn't take out any taxes.
[02:26:41.278 --> 02:26:42.199]  It didn't go.
[02:26:42.199 --> 02:26:46.542]  Now I got a job that hit right to the government with the welfare.
[02:26:46.542 --> 02:26:48.863]  My stamps got cut, everything.
[02:26:48.863 --> 02:26:52.005]  When I was working for Obama, I got everything off the trip.
[02:26:52.005 --> 02:26:55.008]  That right there tells you that it's not right.
[02:26:55.888 --> 02:27:01.973]  Well, look, all I can say is they're doing everything they can to make it not pay to actually work.
[02:27:01.973 --> 02:27:03.995]  Or if you do work, you can't live on it.
[02:27:03.995 --> 02:27:06.397]  I can't, and that's true, sir.
[02:27:06.397 --> 02:27:09.620]  I just got a job, and I'm glad I met you, Alex Jones.
[02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:15.205]  I just got a job, and I'm making a little bit, but it's not what I was making with Obama.
[02:27:16.127 --> 02:27:19.828]  When I was with Obama, I was making a nice dollar to pay my rent.
[02:27:19.828 --> 02:27:23.788]  Here it goes, after November was over, I'm out of a job.
[02:27:23.788 --> 02:27:27.029]  I couldn't even apply for unemployment or any of that.
[02:27:27.029 --> 02:27:30.910]  So, like he was saying, like you say, Alex Jones, I believe that.
[02:27:30.910 --> 02:27:34.870]  Because when I got out of work... We'll fix your piece after the break, I'm sorry.
[02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:37.011]  I'll get it plugged in properly and get you audio and stuff, okay?
[02:27:37.011 --> 02:27:37.391]  Okay.
[02:27:37.391 --> 02:27:38.471]  Keep talking?
[02:27:38.471 --> 02:27:38.991]  No, it's okay.
[02:27:38.991 --> 02:27:39.991]  Just don't worry about it, okay?
[02:27:39.991 --> 02:27:40.931]  Okay.
[02:27:40.931 --> 02:27:43.492]  You just got up, got unplugged, never got plugged back in, right?
[02:27:43.492 --> 02:27:45.092]  We're gonna get you audio during the next thing.
[02:27:45.635 --> 02:27:50.278]  We can just do this whole segment on it right now.
[02:27:50.278 --> 02:27:54.181]  You know, again, this is a program of domination.
[02:27:54.181 --> 02:27:56.202]  A program of total control.
[02:27:56.202 --> 02:28:00.706]  This is a program of domestication.
[02:28:00.706 --> 02:28:01.466]  That's what's happening.
[02:28:01.466 --> 02:28:03.087]  Let's jam a phone call in here.
[02:28:03.087 --> 02:28:04.188]  Jerry in Connecticut.
[02:28:04.188 --> 02:28:04.769]  You're on the air.
[02:28:04.769 --> 02:28:05.109]  Go ahead.
[02:28:06.451 --> 02:28:07.232]  Hi there, Michelle.
[02:28:07.232 --> 02:28:11.698]  You know, you should check out Dick Gregory's interview with Alex Jones.
[02:28:11.698 --> 02:28:19.289]  It'll clue you in a lot to what's really going on in the world and give you a better perspective because you know Dick Gregory.
[02:28:19.289 --> 02:28:21.973]  He's been around for the Civil Rights Movement.
[02:28:21.973 --> 02:28:23.255]  He's been part of everything.
[02:28:24.196 --> 02:28:25.276]  He's seen everything.
[02:28:25.276 --> 02:28:27.778]  He's a man who knows the real world.
[02:28:27.778 --> 02:28:30.741]  He knows 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:28:30.741 --> 02:28:35.365]  He knows they killed JFK, RFK, and Martin Luther King.
[02:28:35.365 --> 02:28:41.470]  And they're the people who want all the guns because they want to put us in the damn camps!
[02:28:41.470 --> 02:28:43.592]  That's the end of the story!
[02:28:43.592 --> 02:28:44.993]  You know, they want to make us dependent.
[02:28:45.553 --> 02:28:50.378]  So we can't live on our own, we can't make our own money and stuff like that.
[02:28:50.378 --> 02:28:53.280]  You gotta realize, this is a sucker game.
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:54.641]  And I'll give you one good example.
[02:28:54.641 --> 02:29:01.608]  The guys who basically funded Romney and also funded Obama, Goldman Sachs.
[02:29:02.248 --> 02:29:06.812]  You know, they play derivatives on foods around the world.
[02:29:06.812 --> 02:29:24.227]  And everybody's been screaming, every civil rights group, because they've been killing millions of kids, because every time they push the prices of food up, through their manipulation of the food prices, they're killing millions of kids in Africa, in Asia, and Obama says nothing!
[02:29:24.227 --> 02:29:24.868]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:29:24.868 --> 02:29:27.670]  When food goes up, like, this is a great call, we're going to hold you over, sir.
[02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:29.211]  Stay right there, I'm going to come back to you, Jerry.
[02:29:30.192 --> 02:29:30.973]  He's exactly right.
[02:29:30.973 --> 02:29:36.136]  When they increase food prices 30-40% here, people just might not get as much food.
[02:29:36.136 --> 02:29:38.918]  Most people are living in a subsistence survival level.
[02:29:38.918 --> 02:29:40.580]  They starve to death.
[02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:45.703]  And then the answer is, oh well, there's too many people to let them die anyways.
[02:29:45.703 --> 02:29:47.424]  Okay, let's just say that's true.
[02:29:47.424 --> 02:29:48.845]  I don't agree with it.
[02:29:48.845 --> 02:29:50.827]  The globalists see us exactly the same as well.
[02:29:50.827 --> 02:29:51.667]  They want us dead.
[02:29:51.667 --> 02:29:52.628]  Stay there.
[02:29:52.628 --> 02:29:54.029]  We're on the march.
[02:29:54.029 --> 02:29:56.551]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.551 --> 02:29:59.233]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:06.878 --> 02:32:12.542]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:32:12.822 --> 02:32:19.410]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[02:32:19.410 --> 02:32:22.754]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert.
[02:32:22.754 --> 02:32:25.097]  Available at Infowars.com.
[02:32:25.097 --> 02:32:28.742]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[02:32:28.922 --> 02:32:32.726]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[02:32:32.726 --> 02:32:37.331]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[02:32:37.331 --> 02:32:39.833]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[02:32:39.833 --> 02:32:43.698]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[02:32:43.698 --> 02:32:48.122]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[02:32:48.122 --> 02:32:50.765]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[02:32:51.065 --> 02:32:57.888]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[02:32:57.888 --> 02:33:02.150]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[02:33:14.076 --> 02:33:15.697]  Go up to InfoWars.com.
[02:33:15.697 --> 02:33:20.659]  You can see some of the great Photoshop artwork by the InfoWars graphics team.
[02:33:20.659 --> 02:33:25.621]  It's Piers Morgan machine gunning the Bill of Rights and Constitution with an AR-15.
[02:33:25.621 --> 02:33:30.143]  Rahm Emanuel, take American people out of Second Amendment debate.
[02:33:31.298 --> 02:33:35.841]  And he is now announcing that they want to use executive orders.
[02:33:35.841 --> 02:33:38.242]  Again, they're expanding that.
[02:33:38.242 --> 02:33:40.524]  Chicago Mayor, limit access to guns.
[02:33:40.524 --> 02:33:46.828]  Chicago Mayor and former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has proposed restricting the discussion over firearms ownership.
[02:33:48.010 --> 02:33:50.113]  In America, to law enforcement.
[02:33:50.113 --> 02:33:51.535]  I mean, what a dictator.
[02:33:51.535 --> 02:33:53.538]  Guys, will you get that audio for me?
[02:33:53.538 --> 02:33:56.141]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:33:56.141 --> 02:33:57.723]  That's up at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:57.723 --> 02:34:00.206]  This is just off the chart.
[02:34:00.206 --> 02:34:02.109]  And again, I covered this at the start of the show.
[02:34:03.350 --> 02:34:12.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are saying they're going to use executive orders, rulemaking, but Schumer came out and said, we'll just order gun shops, do what we want.
[02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:15.303]  And by the way, you're like, well, they can't do that outside law.
[02:34:15.303 --> 02:34:17.405]  The ATF's already been doing that.
[02:34:17.405 --> 02:34:20.488]  So Michelle, Obama phone lady, we're going to go back to the caller.
[02:34:21.870 --> 02:34:24.152]  Jerry, and then hurry through some others and get to some Twitter questions.
[02:34:24.152 --> 02:34:29.396]  You're going to be on the news with us tonight for a more lively discussion.
[02:34:29.396 --> 02:34:32.919]  I know we're just, you know, a little more calm here except during the breaks.
[02:34:32.919 --> 02:34:34.500]  Why are you so restrained right now?
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:35.060]  Which is fine.
[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:37.663]  I mean, I guess we're having a serious discussion.
[02:34:37.663 --> 02:34:48.732]  Well, I'm abnominal about what's going on and I thank God that I came here because I've seen it with my own eyes.
[02:34:50.368 --> 02:34:56.171]  And I guess, I mean, you were saying you've never seen the footage of yourself except on smartphones.
[02:34:56.171 --> 02:34:57.871]  You have a computer at home?
[02:34:57.871 --> 02:34:58.752]  No.
[02:34:58.752 --> 02:35:00.953]  So all you've got is mainstream television?
[02:35:00.953 --> 02:35:03.834]  Mainstream television and my Obama phone.
[02:35:04.625 --> 02:35:05.887]  Which isn't a smartphone, right?
[02:35:05.887 --> 02:35:06.708]  It's just a regular phone.
[02:35:06.708 --> 02:35:07.549]  Regular phone.
[02:35:07.549 --> 02:35:09.210]  So, yeah, because we couldn't send you text messages.
[02:35:09.210 --> 02:35:10.932]  So, literally, what's the number?
[02:35:10.932 --> 02:35:15.578]  I saw a number like 65 million Americans only have access to a television.
[02:35:15.578 --> 02:35:17.560]  Oh, it's a lot of them.
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:21.365]  How many people in your community just only have a television?
[02:35:21.365 --> 02:35:21.865]  Oh, a lot.
[02:35:22.861 --> 02:35:23.541]  A lot of people.
[02:35:23.541 --> 02:35:27.164]  And so you didn't know he told all those lies?
[02:35:27.164 --> 02:35:27.664]  No!
[02:35:27.664 --> 02:35:28.905]  I've got a bunch of others.
[02:35:28.905 --> 02:35:38.911]  But I knew that he lied because about four years ago when I worked for the Obama campaign, he said he was going to re-renovate Harvard and the Lee area.
[02:35:39.551 --> 02:35:42.832]  And that's where he started, where I started campaigning for him.
[02:35:42.832 --> 02:35:46.514]  Here it is, four years went on, and now I'm at another four years.
[02:35:46.514 --> 02:35:48.274]  And that place still looks the same.
[02:35:48.274 --> 02:35:53.796]  Now, they've only put a few hundred billion into infrastructure, which is, if you are going to have government funding, that actually gets the economy going.
[02:35:53.796 --> 02:35:55.217]  It gives people real people jobs.
[02:35:55.217 --> 02:35:55.717]  Right.
[02:35:55.717 --> 02:35:57.438]  If it's not given to your select buddies only.
[02:35:57.978 --> 02:36:03.242]  But they've spent, last time I saw, something like $47 trillion.
[02:36:03.242 --> 02:36:12.710]  You have to understand, the whole country's GDP is like $47 trillion.
[02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:13.711]  I think I said billion.
[02:36:13.711 --> 02:36:15.192]  Those numbers are so big.
[02:36:18.069 --> 02:36:25.313]  Only spent a few hundred billion on infrastructure total in the last four years, and then 47 trillion to offshore megabanks.
[02:36:25.313 --> 02:36:26.514]  You're like, well, where'd that money go?
[02:36:26.514 --> 02:36:27.154]  Right.
[02:36:27.154 --> 02:36:28.935]  It went into derivatives.
[02:36:28.935 --> 02:36:30.416]  So it didn't even really go anywhere.
[02:36:30.416 --> 02:36:31.917]  It was propping up garbage.
[02:36:31.917 --> 02:36:34.618]  And then you're like, well, OK, well, then why are they doing it?
[02:36:34.618 --> 02:36:38.080]  To suck real money out of the economy and get us into debt.
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:39.301]  See, we've been signed on.
[02:36:39.301 --> 02:36:41.222]  It'd be like if I put a chain on your leg.
[02:36:42.022 --> 02:36:48.868]  Okay, that was impossible to get off, tied to let's say a bowling ball that weighed 500 tons.
[02:36:48.868 --> 02:36:50.409]  Are you going to ever be able to pull out of that?
[02:36:50.409 --> 02:36:51.870]  No.
[02:36:51.870 --> 02:36:54.792]  Okay, what if I threw you over the edge of a dock with that on your leg?
[02:36:54.792 --> 02:36:55.533]  No.
[02:36:55.533 --> 02:36:57.034]  So now you're going to be on the bottom of the lake.
[02:36:57.034 --> 02:36:58.075]  Right, right.
[02:36:58.075 --> 02:37:00.797]  It's impossible and it's not our debt.
[02:37:00.797 --> 02:37:02.979]  So what I'm saying is, Michelle, they're predators.
[02:37:02.979 --> 02:37:03.599]  They're bad.
[02:37:03.599 --> 02:37:09.003]  They do everything they can to bankrupt you so that you've got to go to them because they want control.
[02:37:10.151 --> 02:37:14.733]  And that's true because, for instance, how you say of control.
[02:37:14.733 --> 02:37:21.575]  I had a friend that was a school teacher and when she lost her job, she went to apply for the unemployment.
[02:37:21.575 --> 02:37:22.615]  They turned her down.
[02:37:22.615 --> 02:37:25.677]  When she went to the welfare, they gave her the money.
[02:37:25.677 --> 02:37:29.278]  But by her not being, have you worked as a school teacher?
[02:37:29.278 --> 02:37:31.819]  Now you're not working and you're on government assistance.
[02:37:31.819 --> 02:37:34.220]  Do you know how low that is?
[02:37:34.220 --> 02:37:36.020]  So she dropped down that low.
[02:37:36.020 --> 02:37:37.641]  She started drinking beer.
[02:37:39.076 --> 02:37:42.578]  They sell beer in the store, but she would get so drinking.
[02:37:42.578 --> 02:37:45.779]  I guess her mind went crazy, but she would drink so much beer.
[02:37:45.779 --> 02:37:49.160]  Then it got into what the system got in her life.
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:52.302]  And I was like, well, how could they take that quick?
[02:37:53.032 --> 02:38:04.802]  And just by her applying, losing her job, applying for the government, they contacted her, took her kids, put them in foster care, and all that.
[02:38:04.802 --> 02:38:13.670]  And I'm like, here it is, a working woman, been a teacher for all these years, and it wasn't enough money after she lost a job or laid off her- And they took her kids.
[02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:18.615]  And- And her kids, but if you go down the lane of how she got corruptive like that,
[02:38:19.235 --> 02:38:22.016]  You know, when she got corrupted, she started drinking.
[02:38:22.016 --> 02:38:24.057]  When she got drinking, I'm like, it gotta be help.
[02:38:24.057 --> 02:38:26.058]  Let's see about putting her in a place.
[02:38:26.058 --> 02:38:31.920]  When we tried to put her in one of those detox place, by her being on welfare, she couldn't get in.
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:36.362]  I'm like, here it is, a woman need help just because of her welfare, she can't get in.
[02:38:36.362 --> 02:38:39.343]  But it really hindered a friend of mine.
[02:38:40.023 --> 02:38:44.546]  And I couldn't feel that she works 12, 13 years as a school teacher.
[02:38:44.546 --> 02:38:48.089]  She bought this humungous house for these seven kids.
[02:38:48.089 --> 02:38:55.754]  And today, right now, all seven of her kids, they went through that stage with that, but they're doctors, social workers.
[02:38:55.754 --> 02:38:56.855]  There you go.
[02:38:56.855 --> 02:39:03.659]  You know, the average foster child is on seven psychotropic drugs, about 67, 68 percent.
[02:39:03.659 --> 02:39:06.201]  And those drugs are designed to fry their brains.
[02:39:06.201 --> 02:39:06.521]  Right.
[02:39:06.521 --> 02:39:07.522]  Do they put the kids on drugs?
[02:39:07.742 --> 02:39:08.623]  They tried to get me.
[02:39:08.623 --> 02:39:11.705]  I got a son that was tested of HHD.
[02:39:11.705 --> 02:39:13.046]  Totally made up.
[02:39:13.046 --> 02:39:13.586]  Totally.
[02:39:13.586 --> 02:39:14.807]  I got a doctor.
[02:39:14.807 --> 02:39:19.290]  The gas get cut off by me, my family, and everybody going to Agnata Way.
[02:39:19.290 --> 02:39:20.891]  And I'm putting her on there.
[02:39:20.891 --> 02:39:23.252]  Agnata Way is a good doctor in Ohio.
[02:39:23.252 --> 02:39:26.595]  She knew me, my parents, my parents' parents.
[02:39:26.595 --> 02:39:29.416]  It's like a generation went down.
[02:39:29.416 --> 02:39:30.577]  See, that's family.
[02:39:30.577 --> 02:39:31.858]  Family is power.
[02:39:31.858 --> 02:39:32.038]  Right.
[02:39:32.038 --> 02:39:33.619]  The system wants to get rid of that.
[02:39:33.619 --> 02:39:37.422]  And they want federalized health care so that doctor can't
[02:39:38.363 --> 02:39:41.405]  Do what they want, the state wants to be the doctor.
[02:39:41.405 --> 02:39:46.329]  I believe that because the day right now my doctor is getting old.
[02:39:46.329 --> 02:39:48.671]  Her and her husband used to take care of me.
[02:39:48.671 --> 02:39:50.112]  Now my kids go to her.
[02:39:50.112 --> 02:39:53.495]  The husband has got a lot of arthritis going on.
[02:39:53.495 --> 02:39:55.316]  He ain't in there no more, it's just her.
[02:39:55.316 --> 02:39:57.958]  But people are smart, they're from China.
[02:39:57.958 --> 02:39:58.819]  You know what they're doing?
[02:39:58.819 --> 02:40:02.282]  They're sending a whole family to take up for what she's doing.
[02:40:02.822 --> 02:40:09.169]  The mother, first it was the husband and wife acting out a way, now it's the kids, the husband and the wife being doctors.
[02:40:09.169 --> 02:40:14.275]  You know, like I told you about Alex Jones Show, that little kid of yours, he's gonna be the next Alex Jones.
[02:40:14.977 --> 02:40:15.677]  Believe that.
[02:40:15.677 --> 02:40:17.839]  We get old, we can't keep going on and on.
[02:40:17.839 --> 02:40:19.260]  That's the plan.
[02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:24.864]  That's the plan, but I'm quite sure something happened to you, this little kid gonna be here, this is what he like doing.
[02:40:24.864 --> 02:40:26.605]  That's all, you can't drag him away from it.
[02:40:26.605 --> 02:40:26.945]  No.
[02:40:26.945 --> 02:40:28.426]  See, and he's a lot smarter than I am.
[02:40:28.426 --> 02:40:30.588]  And just like they say, it's what we teach them.
[02:40:30.588 --> 02:40:40.655]  I have kids now, and they told me, you can't send that son, I got a son, and I grew up on welfare, and a low black minority, single parent with five kids.
[02:40:41.415 --> 02:40:43.056]  Satan the devil is a liar.
[02:40:43.056 --> 02:40:44.797]  My son is Tyrone Mixon.
[02:40:44.797 --> 02:40:46.579]  He graduated from Hiram College.
[02:40:46.579 --> 02:40:48.019]  He's a social worker.
[02:40:48.019 --> 02:40:50.601]  A VA social worker.
[02:40:50.601 --> 02:40:54.183]  But... But see how he survived the system, but now he works for the system.
[02:40:54.183 --> 02:40:54.584]  Right.
[02:40:54.584 --> 02:41:02.249]  But only way that he got through was that for me being a low black minority with my low income.
[02:41:02.249 --> 02:41:05.931]  Because we couldn't use the dad income because he worked at Chevy Boulevard.
[02:41:05.931 --> 02:41:08.413]  We had to use my income with my five kids.
[02:41:09.233 --> 02:41:15.136]  I couldn't understand that, but as we kept going and he went to Hiram for four years, we were eligible.
[02:41:15.136 --> 02:41:16.176]  All right, let's go back to the calls.
[02:41:16.176 --> 02:41:17.077]  This is amazing.
[02:41:17.077 --> 02:41:19.198]  You're getting wound up now.
[02:41:19.198 --> 02:41:20.499]  And we got a lot of great footage, too.
[02:41:20.499 --> 02:41:21.539]  You're awesome.
[02:41:21.539 --> 02:41:24.520]  Let's go ahead and again, Obama phone lady is here.
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:28.642]  And some people online thought I was going to get her here just to be mean to her.
[02:41:28.642 --> 02:41:33.465]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't need to be mean to people to feel powerful about myself.
[02:41:34.065 --> 02:41:35.266]  It is upsetting.
[02:41:35.266 --> 02:41:37.287]  You know, you're saying, I vote for Obama.
[02:41:37.287 --> 02:41:38.468]  I'm going to get a free phone.
[02:41:38.468 --> 02:41:39.489]  He's going to do more.
[02:41:39.489 --> 02:41:42.951]  But there was that humanity, and you knew it was funny when you were saying it.
[02:41:42.951 --> 02:41:45.773]  And so, yes, we're laughing, but we're not really laughing at you.
[02:41:45.773 --> 02:41:47.214]  We're laughing with you.
[02:41:47.214 --> 02:41:50.577]  What did you think I was going to do when you got down here?
[02:41:50.577 --> 02:41:57.722]  Well, one thing about it, and two, for sure, can't nobody make you look funny if you don't allow them to make you look funny.
[02:41:57.722 --> 02:42:03.226]  I knew whatever thing I did on YouTube with Obama, the people were not happy.
[02:42:04.062 --> 02:42:07.104]  And I don't know why, but I was happy.
[02:42:07.104 --> 02:42:15.988]  Because I was out there campaigning, and when it came time for that cameraman to run up on me, I said, if he run up on me again, I'm talking.
[02:42:15.988 --> 02:42:18.190]  And our bosses had already told us.
[02:42:18.190 --> 02:42:19.690]  Hey, your bosses had told you?
[02:42:19.690 --> 02:42:19.810]  Sorry.
[02:42:19.810 --> 02:42:23.552]  They had already told us, them cameramans run up on you, you leave them alone.
[02:42:23.552 --> 02:42:27.955]  I said, not me walk two miles, and the man keep brushing me with a camera.
[02:42:28.675 --> 02:42:29.656]  He pushed me.
[02:42:29.656 --> 02:42:31.937]  And the next time he pushed me, I got to talking.
[02:42:31.937 --> 02:42:33.858]  It was more than just me talking.
[02:42:33.858 --> 02:42:34.318]  Oh, wait a minute.
[02:42:34.318 --> 02:42:35.859]  That guy pushed you to get you mad?
[02:42:35.859 --> 02:42:36.780]  Pushed me.
[02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:38.861]  And when he pushed me, he started talking.
[02:42:38.861 --> 02:42:39.721]  What he gonna do?
[02:42:39.721 --> 02:42:42.263]  And around him, he was just getting out the truck.
[02:42:43.166 --> 02:42:44.627]  Now you call him O'Romney.
[02:42:44.627 --> 02:42:45.929]  O'Ronomy.
[02:42:45.929 --> 02:42:46.970]  O'Ronimo.
[02:42:46.970 --> 02:42:48.972]  O'Ronomy fool.
[02:42:48.972 --> 02:42:49.633]  Tell us about it.
[02:42:49.633 --> 02:42:50.493]  You saw Mitt Romney.
[02:42:50.493 --> 02:42:51.334]  Tell the story.
[02:42:51.334 --> 02:43:01.304]  Well, while I was campaigning, as you've seen on YouTube, we were walking in circles, but O'Ronomy was standing there and just got out of a truck, entering a building.
[02:43:03.490 --> 02:43:08.372]  They told us to holler and hold our signs up and say more and more to them.
[02:43:08.372 --> 02:43:12.973]  If I can holler at a run of me, what about this little man with this camera behind me?
[02:43:12.973 --> 02:43:16.974]  So they kept on saying, don't talk, don't talk, keep it moving, keep it moving.
[02:43:16.974 --> 02:43:18.595]  It's raining, we're walking.
[02:43:18.595 --> 02:43:24.077]  I done walked about two miles, and then he pushed up on me again, and that's when I got to talking.
[02:43:24.077 --> 02:43:29.478]  But when I got to the office, the next day they was like, oh, we need you in the office.
[02:43:29.478 --> 02:43:31.079]  La la la la la la la la la.
[02:43:31.835 --> 02:43:33.635]  So, I knew I had did something.
[02:43:33.635 --> 02:43:36.256]  That's why they called me the Obama Phone Lady.
[02:43:36.256 --> 02:43:38.896]  Uh-oh, now you're starting to wake up.
[02:43:38.896 --> 02:43:40.337]  Look out!
[02:43:40.337 --> 02:43:43.277]  What would you say to that camera guy if you could see him again?
[02:43:43.277 --> 02:43:47.978]  Man, where the heck you at and why you do me like that?
[02:43:47.978 --> 02:43:49.218]  Because he ran off.
[02:43:49.218 --> 02:43:53.859]  Now that cameraman who got me on YouTube, he got whatever he got.
[02:43:53.859 --> 02:43:57.039]  He didn't give me a name, number, card, anything.
[02:43:57.039 --> 02:43:59.640]  But I thank you for getting me where you got me today.
[02:44:00.714 --> 02:44:03.303]  In fact, when you got off the plane you were thanking Obama.
[02:44:03.303 --> 02:44:05.811]  I mean, I guess Obama is our great provider.
[02:44:07.318 --> 02:44:09.359]  I don't know about all that right now.
[02:44:09.359 --> 02:44:10.299]  Tell me about Obama.
[02:44:10.299 --> 02:44:11.380]  You like him, don't you?
[02:44:11.380 --> 02:44:13.040]  Well, you know, I like Obama.
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:14.761]  You think he's pretty handsome, don't you?
[02:44:14.761 --> 02:44:18.443]  Nah, I think Harvey's handsome.
[02:44:18.443 --> 02:44:20.584]  I wish Harvey, Harvey is pretty slick, actually.
[02:44:20.584 --> 02:44:21.284]  I like him.
[02:44:21.284 --> 02:44:21.884]  I love Harvey.
[02:44:21.884 --> 02:44:23.385]  He looks like he could be in movies.
[02:44:23.385 --> 02:44:24.325]  Kind of a cool cat.
[02:44:24.325 --> 02:44:25.626]  He is a cool cat.
[02:44:25.626 --> 02:44:27.386]  I like, I love Harvey.
[02:44:27.386 --> 02:44:33.049]  But anyway, Obama, when, what I liked about Obama, and it's just for me.
[02:44:33.891 --> 02:44:41.994]  When I campaigned this year, I was out canvassing in the world of Cleveland, and a lot of people didn't know a lot.
[02:44:41.994 --> 02:44:45.475]  And one thing about it, I would be like, can I take your number?
[02:44:45.475 --> 02:44:48.296]  And they would be like, you can call me, but I can't talk back.
[02:44:48.296 --> 02:44:49.696]  I'll call you at another phone.
[02:44:49.696 --> 02:44:50.876]  I'm like, what?
[02:44:50.876 --> 02:44:52.057]  This Obama phone.
[02:44:52.657 --> 02:44:55.899]  I was like, well, if a man gave you an Obama phone, is you gonna vote for him?
[02:44:55.899 --> 02:44:56.779]  Heck yeah!
[02:44:56.779 --> 02:45:01.501]  I had plenty of people telling me, yeah, I'm gonna vote for Obama, but I don't even got a state ID.
[02:45:01.501 --> 02:45:09.265]  I had to show people how in Cleveland you can get your birth certificate and stuff free to get a state ID, so you can vote for Obama.
[02:45:09.265 --> 02:45:10.046]  Did you see any illegals vote?
[02:45:10.791 --> 02:45:12.632]  Illegal?
[02:45:12.632 --> 02:45:13.972]  People that aren't citizens.
[02:45:13.972 --> 02:45:15.993]  Yeah, I even got them to vote.
[02:45:15.993 --> 02:45:17.793]  Oh no, hold on.
[02:45:17.793 --> 02:45:18.953]  Seriously, I was just joking.
[02:45:18.953 --> 02:45:19.554]  I did!
[02:45:19.554 --> 02:45:21.354]  People that wasn't in our country.
[02:45:21.354 --> 02:45:22.435]  Oh no, no.
[02:45:22.435 --> 02:45:29.977]  I had some people, foreign people, that had a paper stating that they were here, they turned over from, they call them Arabs.
[02:45:30.877 --> 02:45:31.777]  Arabs.
[02:45:31.777 --> 02:45:34.338]  In Cleveland, we call them Arabs.
[02:45:34.338 --> 02:45:40.741]  And the Arabs on the store, they've been here two years or whatever, but they don't have a state driver's license or a state ID.
[02:45:40.741 --> 02:45:44.342]  You're saying in Ohio they let people vote from other countries?
[02:45:44.342 --> 02:45:44.722]  No.
[02:45:44.722 --> 02:45:46.943]  They had to get a state ID.
[02:45:46.943 --> 02:45:51.245]  No, I understand, but getting the ID allowed them to vote.
[02:45:51.245 --> 02:45:51.485]  Right.
[02:45:52.145 --> 02:45:53.126]  Because they've been here.
[02:45:53.126 --> 02:46:00.015]  One dude told me he's been here three, four years and he never voted because he's foreign or not from here.
[02:46:00.015 --> 02:46:01.798]  And I said, how long you been here?
[02:46:01.798 --> 02:46:02.739]  He said two years.
[02:46:02.739 --> 02:46:05.363]  And I said, and you're sure they weren't citizens?
[02:46:05.363 --> 02:46:06.564]  No, they weren't citizens.
[02:46:06.564 --> 02:46:08.186]  Not if you ain't from America.
[02:46:09.728 --> 02:46:14.829]  IDs from Wyoming, W-Y-O-M-I-N-G, Wyoming?
[02:46:14.829 --> 02:46:15.669]  Yemen?
[02:46:15.669 --> 02:46:16.370]  Something like that.
[02:46:16.370 --> 02:46:20.391]  I knew they wouldn't because they talk like we talk, but they're not from here.
[02:46:20.391 --> 02:46:21.551]  All right, Michelle, I just want to be clear.
[02:46:21.551 --> 02:46:22.151]  I like you.
[02:46:22.151 --> 02:46:24.431]  I think you're a good person.
[02:46:24.431 --> 02:46:34.654]  And I wanted to make sure earlier, just to be clear, you didn't know that people that are foreigners aren't allowed to vote, right?
[02:46:34.654 --> 02:46:35.314]  You didn't know that.
[02:46:36.479 --> 02:46:41.145]  But when they've been here in America so long, they could go get a state ID and vote.
[02:46:41.145 --> 02:46:43.789]  I know, so they told you that was okay at the Democratic Party?
[02:46:43.789 --> 02:46:44.470]  Yeah.
[02:46:44.470 --> 02:46:46.492]  They said, oh, go get them a driver's license.
[02:46:46.492 --> 02:46:52.280]  They've been here for so much of us time, because I had to check back with the office and see how they can vote.
[02:46:53.101 --> 02:46:55.562]  They are legal American now.
[02:46:55.562 --> 02:46:56.823]  They've been here so long.
[02:46:56.823 --> 02:46:58.063]  So they were citizens?
[02:46:58.063 --> 02:47:01.925]  They were citizens, but they didn't know that they were citizens.
[02:47:01.925 --> 02:47:06.347]  Well, I guess they did know because they still have foreign identification.
[02:47:06.347 --> 02:47:09.228]  But they've been here a long time.
[02:47:09.228 --> 02:47:12.289]  And then you would help them go get a driver's license that allowed them to vote.
[02:47:12.289 --> 02:47:12.569]  Right.
[02:47:12.569 --> 02:47:13.109]  State ID.
[02:47:13.109 --> 02:47:14.370]  And they were able to vote.
[02:47:14.370 --> 02:47:16.191]  They've been here for up some years.
[02:47:16.191 --> 02:47:18.292]  He said he owned the store like four years.
[02:47:18.292 --> 02:47:19.052]  He never voted.
[02:47:20.037 --> 02:47:20.960]  And I said, well why?
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:23.547]  He said he never even applied for a state ID.
[02:47:23.547 --> 02:47:25.692]  Have you heard about the problem of illegal aliens voting?
[02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:29.901]  Alright, well let's just be clear.
[02:47:29.901 --> 02:47:32.543]  You're not sure if they were citizens or not?
[02:47:32.543 --> 02:47:36.906]  I believe they were citizens, because I took them to get an ID and they were able to vote.
[02:47:36.906 --> 02:47:42.130]  So they had to live here for a long time, a period of time, and just didn't know... Well, you know in California they're giving illegals IDs.
[02:47:42.130 --> 02:47:43.572]  I mean, they give them to them everywhere.
[02:47:43.572 --> 02:47:44.913]  They give them to them in Texas.
[02:47:44.913 --> 02:47:46.294]  See, I didn't know that.
[02:47:46.294 --> 02:47:50.137]  In Cleveland, I know, if you ain't got a state ID, that was my job title.
[02:47:50.137 --> 02:47:52.358]  If you didn't have a state ID, you couldn't go vote.
[02:47:52.358 --> 02:47:56.742]  But if I can go get you, you can go with your birth certificate and social security and get a state ID, you can vote.
[02:47:58.126 --> 02:48:00.349]  Oh, so they had birth certificates and state IDs.
[02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:01.751]  No, they didn't have state IDs.
[02:48:01.751 --> 02:48:03.953]  They had the out-of-town IDs.
[02:48:04.653 --> 02:48:06.034]  So they didn't have birth certificates?
[02:48:06.034 --> 02:48:07.955]  They had birth certificates, but they had been here.
[02:48:07.955 --> 02:48:09.056]  They're legal.
[02:48:09.056 --> 02:48:11.417]  They're legal to be in Ohio.
[02:48:11.417 --> 02:48:13.458]  But they didn't ever... They were legal immigrants?
[02:48:13.458 --> 02:48:14.019]  Right.
[02:48:14.019 --> 02:48:15.039]  They'd been here a while.
[02:48:15.039 --> 02:48:16.760]  Were they citizens?
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:17.701]  Yeah, they citizens.
[02:48:17.701 --> 02:48:19.382]  If they're legal, they citizens.
[02:48:19.382 --> 02:48:22.303]  They were citizens, but they didn't know nothing about getting a state ID.
[02:48:22.303 --> 02:48:23.024]  Alright, that makes sense.
[02:48:23.024 --> 02:48:23.244]  Okay.
[02:48:23.244 --> 02:48:24.245]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:48:24.245 --> 02:48:25.125]  They were citizens.
[02:48:25.125 --> 02:48:26.286]  They'd been here, what, three, four years?
[02:48:26.286 --> 02:48:27.687]  Yeah.
[02:48:27.687 --> 02:48:29.648]  I've had a couple of them like that.
[02:48:29.648 --> 02:48:31.509]  I had people, girls 21.
[02:48:31.509 --> 02:48:32.870]  I had a lot of young girls.
[02:48:33.610 --> 02:48:40.533]  You know, they talking on Obama living in the projects, and if that phone stopped your minutes, what you gonna do?
[02:48:40.533 --> 02:48:42.214]  Go to a payphone.
[02:48:42.214 --> 02:48:44.075]  She had no other choice.
[02:48:44.075 --> 02:48:48.937]  But by him giving you that phone, this is what I preached to him when I was in the field service.
[02:48:48.937 --> 02:48:51.559]  By him giving you that phone, do you want to give him a vote?
[02:48:52.403 --> 02:48:56.264]  She tell me, I don't know what Obama does, but you're talking on his phone.
[02:48:56.264 --> 02:48:59.265]  Open your phone and tell me what it say as soon as you open it.
[02:48:59.265 --> 02:49:03.307]  She open it and say, Obama, you know he's running for president right now?
[02:49:03.307 --> 02:49:04.767]  That's how I got it.
[02:49:04.767 --> 02:49:06.848]  And then you didn't even have to give me anything.
[02:49:06.848 --> 02:49:08.608]  Do you got your state ID on you?
[02:49:08.608 --> 02:49:10.649]  And they will say, yeah, all I need is the numbers.
[02:49:11.621 --> 02:49:16.123]  I could take them numbers off that state ID and give her a blue form where you can mail it in.
[02:49:16.123 --> 02:49:18.144]  You don't even gotta go there.
[02:49:18.144 --> 02:49:18.764]  I got warrants.
[02:49:18.764 --> 02:49:20.384]  I'm not going to the Board of Elections.
[02:49:20.384 --> 02:49:21.045]  You don't need to.
[02:49:21.045 --> 02:49:24.226]  Let me fill this paper out and the ballot gonna come to your house.
[02:49:24.226 --> 02:49:28.087]  When the ballot come in, you fill it out and mail it right back.
[02:49:28.087 --> 02:49:29.348]  Wow.
[02:49:29.348 --> 02:49:29.788]  Amazing.
[02:49:29.788 --> 02:49:33.289]  Stacks of people like that in Cleveland.
[02:49:33.289 --> 02:49:33.709]  You know?
[02:49:33.709 --> 02:49:35.090]  Let's talk to Jerry.
[02:49:35.090 --> 02:49:38.051]  This is Law and Folks, Obama phone lady here in studio with us.
[02:49:38.051 --> 02:49:39.172]  Jerry in Connecticut.
[02:49:39.172 --> 02:49:40.212]  Finish up your point, my friend.
[02:49:40.990 --> 02:49:45.216]  Yeah, Michelle, you seem like you're a believing woman.
[02:49:45.216 --> 02:49:50.323]  You realize we're in the latter days, I'm sure you do, from all the signs and things like that, right?
[02:49:50.323 --> 02:49:51.445]  Right.
[02:49:51.445 --> 02:49:52.767]  Well, why don't you look up...
[02:49:53.741 --> 02:49:59.362]  Uh, Obama and, uh, November 5th, Illinois State Lottery winning.
[02:49:59.362 --> 02:50:10.645]  If God was going to give us an indication that this man is on the wrong side of this battle for, for our souls, then look up November 5th, Illinois Lottery.
[02:50:10.645 --> 02:50:18.627]  The number that came up for the pick three, three, and this is not a, I checked this out myself on one of those, uh, you know, check the numbers, you know, type of thing.
[02:50:18.627 --> 02:50:19.167]  Right, right.
[02:50:19.167 --> 02:50:21.628]  Came up six, six, six.
[02:50:22.128 --> 02:50:22.888]  No, I remember.
[02:50:22.888 --> 02:50:24.068]  And then some others came up 666.
[02:50:24.068 --> 02:50:26.789]  Right, I remember that too.
[02:50:26.789 --> 02:50:27.329]  Yeah.
[02:50:27.329 --> 02:50:33.430]  Anyway, the other thing I wanted to mention is the Tuskegee situation you kept talking about.
[02:50:33.430 --> 02:50:38.151]  Now, that guy that did that experiment in Tuskegee, he's an equal opportunity guy.
[02:50:38.151 --> 02:50:39.572]  They didn't put him in jail.
[02:50:39.572 --> 02:50:40.152]  You know what they did?
[02:50:40.152 --> 02:50:45.033]  They sent him off to one of the nuclear plants out in, I think it was in Ohio.
[02:50:45.593 --> 02:50:55.586]  And then he decided to do an experiment by releasing all those nice nuclear particles in the air to see how they would affect other people in the entire region.
[02:50:55.586 --> 02:50:56.728]  Isn't that nice?
[02:50:56.728 --> 02:50:58.330]  Our government is really working for us.
[02:50:58.330 --> 02:50:59.231]  Yeah, they're really good people.
[02:50:59.231 --> 02:51:00.652]  I think we should turn our guns into them.
[02:51:00.652 --> 02:51:01.494]  More calls coming up.
[02:51:03.678 --> 02:51:05.079]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:05.079 --> 02:51:15.746]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:51:15.746 --> 02:51:22.951]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[02:51:22.951 --> 02:51:33.558]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:51:34.218 --> 02:51:37.701]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:51:37.701 --> 02:51:43.865]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:51:43.865 --> 02:51:53.752]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:51:53.752 --> 02:51:55.253]  The war is here.
[02:51:55.253 --> 02:51:57.155]  It's an info war.
[02:51:57.155 --> 02:51:59.877]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:52:04.892 --> 02:52:07.134]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[02:52:07.134 --> 02:52:12.200]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:14.022]  This is really scary stuff.
[02:52:14.022 --> 02:52:19.288]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.
[02:52:19.288 --> 02:52:26.475]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[02:52:27.324 --> 02:52:30.107]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[02:52:30.107 --> 02:52:33.890]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[02:52:33.890 --> 02:52:42.438]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[02:52:42.438 --> 02:52:52.607]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[02:52:53.328 --> 02:52:58.649]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[02:52:58.649 --> 02:53:02.630]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:07.391]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:07.391 --> 02:53:10.431]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:10.431 --> 02:53:18.733]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:19.384 --> 02:53:24.945]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:24.945 --> 02:53:36.307]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:36.307 --> 02:53:43.309]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:43.989 --> 02:53:48.291]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:48.291 --> 02:53:51.893]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:51.893 --> 02:53:59.157]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:53:59.157 --> 02:54:00.417]  Protect your immune system.
[02:54:00.417 --> 02:54:01.458]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:09.128 --> 02:54:16.232]  Obviously, we're going to have to go into 20 minutes, 30 minutes of overdrive to get to all your phone calls and get to all these Twitter questions.
[02:54:16.232 --> 02:54:17.092]  There are so many.
[02:54:17.092 --> 02:54:18.973]  I mean, I've got hundreds here and they're all so good.
[02:54:18.973 --> 02:54:23.595]  I'm going to try to go through a bunch of quick questions for you and not dominate.
[02:54:23.595 --> 02:54:30.759]  Obviously, on the nightly news tonight, I think David Ortiz is doing the first part, but I'm going to do the interview part.
[02:54:30.759 --> 02:54:33.240]  She's warmed up now, folks.
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:37.082]  We're going to air some excerpts to when she got here yesterday on the nightly news, seven o'clock central.
[02:54:37.842 --> 02:54:41.845]  But, uh, I'm also going to cover... Man, this is bad.
[02:54:41.845 --> 02:54:44.687]  I covered some of it today, but I didn't get into all of it.
[02:54:44.687 --> 02:54:47.549]  The announcement is they're just going to go with executive authority.
[02:54:47.549 --> 02:54:52.652]  Executive orders, ordering gun shops to shut down, not to sell semi-autos.
[02:54:52.652 --> 02:54:58.136]  And now Rahm Emanuel has said, citizens aren't even in the discussion about guns, the police are.
[02:54:58.136 --> 02:54:59.236]  Well, that's Judge Dredd.
[02:54:59.236 --> 02:55:01.258]  I mean, might as well just become the Soviet Union.
[02:55:02.369 --> 02:55:05.533]  And this is where big governments and big police forces always go.
[02:55:05.533 --> 02:55:07.175]  That's why we obsess over the police.
[02:55:07.175 --> 02:55:11.059]  There are a lot of good police, and either a department's good or it's bad.
[02:55:11.059 --> 02:55:18.007]  There's hardly ever an in-between, but the feds want bad departments, like the Chicago mob-run Rahm Emanuel system.
[02:55:21.258 --> 02:55:23.119]  It is a despicable person.
[02:55:23.119 --> 02:55:31.524]  Here is the mayor of Chicago, very dangerous person, saying that he wants the American people to not be able to have any input on their guns.
[02:55:31.524 --> 02:55:34.065]  Hey punk, it's called the Second Amendment, here it is.
[02:55:34.065 --> 02:55:35.686]  One, it's all about criminal access.
[02:55:35.686 --> 02:55:40.789]  It's not about gun control, it's about criminal access to guns.
[02:55:40.789 --> 02:55:42.710]  That changes the debate.
[02:55:42.710 --> 02:55:46.772]  Two, put the police chief and the law enforcement community front and center.
[02:55:47.717 --> 02:55:51.743]  Everybody else, from politicians or whatever, take a back seat.
[02:55:51.743 --> 02:55:57.531]  Because the police chiefs have a credibility and authority and a voice on this, which is why they're all there.
[02:55:57.531 --> 02:56:03.819]  I do believe as it relates to both the type of weapon being an assault weapon in this case, or the assault magazine, as Mike has
[02:56:04.781 --> 02:56:17.210]  I think strenuously focus us on message on that because the difference between and I would between a magazine that holds 10 and a magazine that holds 20 or 30 is a lot of different type of damage.
[02:56:17.210 --> 02:56:17.891]  Yeah.
[02:56:17.891 --> 02:56:23.014]  And those are the three things I do think you can change this debate.
[02:56:23.014 --> 02:56:27.438]  I think I also think the country's in a different place like it was when we did Brady.
[02:56:28.393 --> 02:56:34.258]  Man, the older he gets, he looks like a twin brother of Bloomberg.
[02:56:34.258 --> 02:56:36.120]  I was just sitting there looking at him.
[02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:42.926]  Ladies and gentlemen, you just heard him say, now by the way, in major polls, 98%, you can pull this up, of police are pro-Second Amendment.
[02:56:42.926 --> 02:56:46.209]  Most of the police chiefs are anti-Second Amendment because they're getting federal money.
[02:56:46.869 --> 02:56:59.140]  And there's a guy up there, who's an Israeli officer by the way, it's just unbelievable, saying, by the way, our tax money pays to get Israel guns, which I'm all for citizens having guns wherever.
[02:56:59.140 --> 02:57:00.562]  Switzerland, Israel, wherever.
[02:57:00.562 --> 02:57:05.286]  And then he doesn't want us to have guns, he wants us to be like Chicago, where the citizens don't have guns.
[02:57:05.286 --> 02:57:07.188]  What do you think of that?
[02:57:07.188 --> 02:57:08.209]  I think that sucks.
[02:57:09.329 --> 02:57:12.170]  Well there you go, you're becoming an info warrior.
[02:57:12.170 --> 02:57:14.892]  He gets to have guns and bodyguards but we don't?
[02:57:14.892 --> 02:57:16.432]  We need the same thing.
[02:57:16.432 --> 02:57:18.373]  You say we need a second amendment, bad!
[02:57:18.373 --> 02:57:21.154]  We need a second amendment, bad!
[02:57:21.154 --> 02:57:21.595]  That's true.
[02:57:21.595 --> 02:57:23.095]  How about an Obama gun?
[02:57:23.095 --> 02:57:26.457]  He gave me an M4, he gonna do more.
[02:57:26.457 --> 02:57:31.019]  That would be constitutional if the government issued us all weapons.
[02:57:31.019 --> 02:57:32.880]  I'm serious, that's what taxes are for.
[02:57:34.278 --> 02:57:42.704]  The state should be taking taxes out to issue everybody that wants to be in the state militia, we should have grenade launchers, everything.
[02:57:42.704 --> 02:57:45.306]  You know, Switzerland has that and they don't have any crime.
[02:57:45.306 --> 02:57:47.247]  Almost none.
[02:57:47.247 --> 02:57:48.909]  That makes sense, though.
[02:57:48.909 --> 02:57:49.449]  Absolutely.
[02:57:49.449 --> 02:57:51.050]  We're the people, we're the government.
[02:57:51.050 --> 02:57:52.812]  Right, we got you in there.
[02:57:52.812 --> 02:57:56.074]  Right, give us something to keep us safe.
[02:57:56.074 --> 02:57:56.794]  You feel me?
[02:57:56.794 --> 02:57:59.496]  You think anybody's going to be messing around, everybody's armed?
[02:57:59.496 --> 02:58:00.897]  No.
[02:58:00.897 --> 02:58:01.338]  No, they're not.
[02:58:02.799 --> 02:58:06.460]  And of course, then all the tough guys will leave their guns at home, Bill.
[02:58:06.460 --> 02:58:08.181]  Don't take your guns to town.
[02:58:08.181 --> 02:58:09.681]  Right.
[02:58:09.681 --> 02:58:11.762]  You know that song, Johnny Cash?
[02:58:11.762 --> 02:58:13.762]  Don't take your guns to town, Bill.
[02:58:13.762 --> 02:58:18.684]  Leave your guns at home, son.
[02:58:18.684 --> 02:58:20.064]  It's Obama Lady!
[02:58:20.064 --> 02:58:23.665]  Obama Lady in town, in Austin, Texas, right here.
[02:58:23.665 --> 02:58:27.066]  Can you say, I got me an Obama M4?
[02:58:27.066 --> 02:58:27.887]  What's that?
[02:58:27.887 --> 02:58:28.287]  That's an M16.
[02:58:29.747 --> 02:58:32.448]  I got me an Obama M4, and he gonna do more.
[02:58:32.448 --> 02:58:36.669]  He's gonna give me a grenade launcher under it.
[02:58:36.669 --> 02:58:39.269]  Say hello to my little friend, Overdrive.
[02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:40.930]  Your calls, tweet questions, and more.

[03:00:12.452 --> 03:00:13.853]  You want answers?
[03:00:13.853 --> 03:00:15.935]  So does Obama Phone Lady.

[03:00:19.878 --> 03:00:24.522]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.522 --> 03:00:26.284]  Alright, Michelle, you're getting wound up.
[03:00:26.284 --> 03:00:27.525]  There's callers who want to talk to you.
[03:00:27.525 --> 03:00:29.887]  We're going to them right now.
[03:00:29.887 --> 03:00:32.009]  And, uh, who was that first caller?
[03:00:35.217 --> 03:00:38.498]  Abdel in Arizona, you're on the air.
[03:00:38.498 --> 03:00:40.719]  Welcome, you're on the phone with Obama Lady.
[03:00:40.719 --> 03:00:43.260]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:43.680]  Good, man.
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:45.541]  What's on your mind?
[03:00:45.541 --> 03:00:46.121]  Nothing much.
[03:00:46.121 --> 03:00:49.462]  I just wanted to say hello to you and to Obama Lady.
[03:00:49.462 --> 03:00:52.103]  Here in Tucson, everybody calls it the same thing.
[03:00:52.103 --> 03:00:54.364]  Like, we've been calling it since they came out.
[03:00:54.364 --> 03:00:58.665]  So, it's kind of a spontaneous thing, I would believe.
[03:00:58.665 --> 03:01:00.906]  To call the phone the Obama Phone.
[03:01:00.906 --> 03:01:03.887]  Yeah, I'm now, everybody I know is calling their phone the Obama Phone.
[03:01:04.952 --> 03:01:10.155]  Yeah, it seems like anything that comes Socialist will go ahead and call it, dub it the Obama, whatever it is.
[03:01:10.155 --> 03:01:14.237]  And on that note, you know, I'm a long-time listener.
[03:01:14.237 --> 03:01:16.379]  I've been following you for about nine, ten years.
[03:01:16.379 --> 03:01:22.022]  I've had my own MKUltra experience here in Tucson that, you know, I would be for a different call or whatnot, but...
[03:01:24.261 --> 03:01:25.583]  Yeah, you know, that's the thing.
[03:01:25.583 --> 03:01:30.810]  Even with me knowing the whole situation with the New World Order and everything, I still voted for him twice.
[03:01:30.810 --> 03:01:32.892]  And I consider myself a libertarian.
[03:01:32.892 --> 03:01:35.015]  I follow Ron Paul.
[03:01:35.015 --> 03:01:36.857]  So that's how powerful and how dangerous he is.
[03:01:36.857 --> 03:01:39.341]  Even with me knowing better, I still go ahead and vote for him.
[03:01:40.373 --> 03:01:42.134]  That does sound like mind control.
[03:01:42.134 --> 03:01:44.454]  My thing is you've got to call the whole thing as a fraud.
[03:01:44.454 --> 03:01:47.795]  It's like when I got in Piers Morgan's face and said, look, the scam's over, man.
[03:01:47.795 --> 03:01:48.896]  You want my guns?
[03:01:48.896 --> 03:01:50.236]  Shut up and stop saying you don't.
[03:01:50.236 --> 03:01:52.017]  They're like, we just want something reasonable.
[03:01:52.017 --> 03:01:53.117]  We just want something reasonable.
[03:01:53.117 --> 03:01:53.577]  Here's the bill.
[03:01:53.577 --> 03:01:54.838]  You can turn your guns in.
[03:01:54.838 --> 03:01:56.358]  I'm like, shut up!
[03:01:56.358 --> 03:01:58.039]  Stop lying to my face, you punk!
[03:01:59.614 --> 03:02:00.715]  Good job on that show.
[03:02:00.715 --> 03:02:01.556]  That was awesome.
[03:02:01.556 --> 03:02:02.516]  I got really excited.
[03:02:02.516 --> 03:02:09.802]  I got, you know, the electric liberty you like to say kind of, you know, transcends through the, you know, television and a lot of people saw that, so that was good.
[03:02:09.802 --> 03:02:10.482]  Well, God bless you.
[03:02:10.482 --> 03:02:12.224]  I appreciate you holding to say that.
[03:02:12.224 --> 03:02:14.325]  What would you say to Pierce Morgan?
[03:02:14.325 --> 03:02:18.288]  Red coat.
[03:02:18.288 --> 03:02:22.352]  What would you say to him coming over to our country and saying, turn your guns in?
[03:02:22.352 --> 03:02:23.272]  Stop lying.
[03:02:23.272 --> 03:02:25.934]  Take that stuff back to where you come from.
[03:02:25.934 --> 03:02:29.057]  If you could be saved with a gun, we need to be saved with ours.
[03:02:29.636 --> 03:02:31.497]  That's right, so now you're being converted.
[03:02:31.497 --> 03:02:38.443]  The Obama phone lady is now the Obama M4 lady.
[03:02:38.443 --> 03:02:43.307]  Protect me with an Obama gun and an Obama grenade!
[03:02:43.307 --> 03:02:46.509]  I want the protection just like him!
[03:02:46.509 --> 03:02:47.970]  There you go, common sense!
[03:02:47.970 --> 03:02:49.251]  That's right.
[03:02:49.251 --> 03:02:57.718]  What do you think of Rahm Emanuel saying, let's take the gun laws out of the hands of the people and just let the paramilitary take our guns?
[03:02:57.718 --> 03:02:57.798]  No.
[03:03:00.046 --> 03:03:03.008]  Doesn't Rahm Emanuel look like a bad guy out of a cartoon?
[03:03:03.008 --> 03:03:05.550]  Like, out of a... He look like he drunk.
[03:03:05.550 --> 03:03:06.451]  He look like he drinks.
[03:03:06.451 --> 03:03:08.132]  He's a little buzzin'.
[03:03:08.132 --> 03:03:09.313]  Well, he is a craze maniac.
[03:03:09.313 --> 03:03:11.595]  You know, he's a ballet dancer.
[03:03:11.595 --> 03:03:12.516]  Oh, is he?
[03:03:12.516 --> 03:03:14.577]  Well, I wouldn't listen to nothing he say.
[03:03:14.577 --> 03:03:17.760]  Any man step on they tiptoes a fool.
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:20.102]  Men don't walk on tiptoes.
[03:03:20.102 --> 03:03:22.383]  Men get sewer and plumbing.
[03:03:25.071 --> 03:03:26.812]  You like real men, don't you?
[03:03:26.812 --> 03:03:27.453]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:27.453 --> 03:03:29.534]  I want no punk.
[03:03:29.534 --> 03:03:32.016]  Obama, you punk.
[03:03:32.016 --> 03:03:35.278]  Oh, my God.
[03:03:35.278 --> 03:03:37.700]  I think Obama's doing the punking of us.
[03:03:37.700 --> 03:03:38.620]  He already did.
[03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:42.823]  Look how those kids got killed in that school.
[03:03:42.823 --> 03:03:45.125]  And he wasn't.
[03:03:45.125 --> 03:03:47.867]  I mean, the tears look like, you know, just dripping.
[03:03:47.867 --> 03:03:53.411]  But if I was a president and the man killed them kids like that, do you know what I would have did?
[03:03:54.721 --> 03:03:55.181]  Huh?
[03:03:55.181 --> 03:03:55.922]  What?
[03:03:55.922 --> 03:03:59.123]  I would've hung his ass by the balls.
[03:03:59.123 --> 03:04:00.484]  Right in front of America.
[03:04:00.484 --> 03:04:02.625]  I would've hung him straight up.
[03:04:02.625 --> 03:04:03.666]  See what you did?
[03:04:03.666 --> 03:04:04.606]  Now look at here.
[03:04:04.606 --> 03:04:09.028]  And all the boys there with the funerals and their babies.
[03:04:09.028 --> 03:04:11.750]  Could you imagine coming home and I got five kids?
[03:04:13.024 --> 03:04:13.264]  That's it?
[03:04:13.264 --> 03:04:15.786]  My kid thinking he's safe in school?
[03:04:15.786 --> 03:04:24.413]  Well, hey, it's the government that advertises the place to go kill people is at a school, and then they take all the guns out and don't let the principals or anybody have guns.
[03:04:24.413 --> 03:04:27.476]  The answer is they have instant access pistol safes that are biometric.
[03:04:27.476 --> 03:04:29.217]  You lay your hand on it, it pops open.
[03:04:29.217 --> 03:04:30.318]  I got them at home.
[03:04:30.318 --> 03:04:33.460]  And I've also got the type of coat into.
[03:04:33.460 --> 03:04:34.781]  Bam, bam, bam, boom.
[03:04:34.781 --> 03:04:35.222]  Door pops open.
[03:04:35.222 --> 03:04:36.002]  But you know what?
[03:04:36.002 --> 03:04:37.263]  I'm really getting on you now.
[03:04:38.297 --> 03:04:40.818]  I'm on the Alex Jones Show now!
[03:04:40.818 --> 03:04:42.899]  Because what you're saying is true.
[03:04:42.899 --> 03:04:46.660]  Now, I'm in Ohio, and I'm born and raised in the Heights.
[03:04:46.660 --> 03:04:47.840]  Cleveland Heights.
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:50.381]  In Cleveland Heights, you got metal detectors and all that.
[03:04:50.381 --> 03:04:51.921]  Hold on, I want to hear us when we get a break.
[03:04:51.921 --> 03:04:53.402]  All the breaks are at the end of the hour, start of the hour.
[03:04:53.402 --> 03:04:55.463]  She's like, what's going on with all these ads during the break?
[03:04:55.463 --> 03:04:56.383]  It's commercial radio.
[03:04:56.383 --> 03:04:58.644]  Most radio has 16 minutes of ads.
[03:04:58.644 --> 03:04:59.164]  We only have 14.
[03:04:59.164 --> 03:05:00.404]  I'm letting the audience know.
[03:05:00.404 --> 03:05:02.405]  We'll be right back with ObamaPhone.
[03:05:03.749 --> 03:05:05.171]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:05.171 --> 03:05:15.843]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:15.843 --> 03:05:19.928]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:20.288 --> 03:05:23.030]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:34.317]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:34.317 --> 03:05:37.499]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:37.799 --> 03:05:43.940]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:43.940 --> 03:05:53.823]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:53.823 --> 03:05:55.323]  The war is here.
[03:05:55.323 --> 03:05:57.224]  It's an info war.
[03:05:57.224 --> 03:05:58.984]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:04.758 --> 03:06:08.200]  You've come to expect winter specials from Herbal Healer Academy.
[03:06:08.200 --> 03:06:09.941]  And we're not going to let you down.
[03:06:09.941 --> 03:06:13.903]  Battle through cold and flu season with powerful natural and safe flu fighters.
[03:06:13.903 --> 03:06:17.686]  Antivirals like olive leaf extract capsules and elderberry power.
[03:06:17.686 --> 03:06:20.147]  Vitamin D3 180 caps only $9.
[03:06:20.147 --> 03:06:23.529]  Beta-glucans and an incredible immune system booster.
[03:06:23.889 --> 03:06:24.489]  I think so.
[03:06:48.064 --> 03:06:52.930]  Log on and save big now when you hit the winter specials at HerbalHealer.com.
[03:06:52.930 --> 03:06:57.136]  Healing the world with nature, one person at a time since 1988.
[03:06:57.136 --> 03:07:00.761]  Celebrating 25 years in service to the natural healthcare industry.
[03:07:03.058 --> 03:07:05.319]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[03:07:05.319 --> 03:07:06.259]  Answer this.
[03:07:06.259 --> 03:07:18.544]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?
[03:07:19.804 --> 03:07:21.965]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[03:07:21.965 --> 03:07:24.086]  This year about one in every 50 U.S.
[03:07:24.086 --> 03:07:28.168]  homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually picking the easy target.
[03:07:28.168 --> 03:07:30.750]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[03:07:30.750 --> 03:07:38.814]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[03:07:38.814 --> 03:07:41.775]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[03:07:41.775 --> 03:07:42.235]  And for only $34.95,
[03:07:43.536 --> 03:07:48.840]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[03:07:48.840 --> 03:07:51.521]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[03:07:51.521 --> 03:07:53.142]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com.
[03:07:53.142 --> 03:07:54.623]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[03:08:18.075 --> 03:08:25.543]  Ladies and gentlemen, directly from Cleveland, Ohio.
[03:08:25.543 --> 03:08:26.765]  She's here.
[03:08:26.765 --> 03:08:30.990]  I'm live in Austin, Texas.
[03:08:30.990 --> 03:08:33.052]  Alright.
[03:08:33.052 --> 03:08:37.377]  We had a good time last night.
[03:08:40.097 --> 03:08:45.041]  A lot of folks will ask, hey, we've got all this hardcore news, all this stuff's going on, why is the Obama phone lady here?
[03:08:45.041 --> 03:08:47.883]  And some thought, oh, he's going to get her there and be mean to her.
[03:08:47.883 --> 03:08:50.024]  No, I said, I bet she's a really interesting lady.
[03:08:50.024 --> 03:08:52.326]  I could just tell from that video.
[03:08:52.326 --> 03:08:58.670]  And I want to try to say, listen, I get that Romney's not good either, but let's just admit Obama doesn't care about us.
[03:08:58.670 --> 03:09:01.753]  Let's just admit he's bought and paid for by a corrupt special interest.
[03:09:02.679 --> 03:09:06.302]  Let's just admit, they're trying to divide and conquer us.
[03:09:06.302 --> 03:09:18.554]  And while we've been sitting here, I've been convincing you on the Second Amendment, I've been convincing you on a bunch of other stuff, and you were saying before the break, and we're going back to calls and Twitter questions here, that, and again, if you don't know who she is, folks, you know the thing about Obama.
[03:09:18.554 --> 03:09:20.596]  I'm an Obama phone lady!
[03:09:20.596 --> 03:09:23.198]  He gave us, well, repeat yourself there so they know who you are.
[03:09:23.198 --> 03:09:26.181]  I'm an Obama phone lady, he gave us a phone and he's gonna do more!
[03:09:27.338 --> 03:09:30.339]  And now you're saying the government should actually only tax us to give us M-16s.
[03:09:30.339 --> 03:09:34.800]  Oh, he should give me a gun and some grenades.
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:38.681]  You know, you're taking it away, but we need our force here, too.
[03:09:38.681 --> 03:09:40.761]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:40.761 --> 03:09:42.962]  No, but seriously, you wanted to say something about the Second Amendment.
[03:09:42.962 --> 03:09:52.064]  I was pointing out that they've made the schools victim disarmament zones, then they advertise for crazy people, hey, don't just kill yourself, the option is going down to a school and do it.
[03:09:52.064 --> 03:09:53.264]  That's what the real tough guys do.
[03:09:54.591 --> 03:10:02.381]  I think that sucks, because here we is, I got kids, I put my kids in school, and the first thing I think, they're safe.
[03:10:02.381 --> 03:10:03.602]  They're at school.
[03:10:03.602 --> 03:10:06.506]  When I was growing up, they didn't have all this going on.
[03:10:06.506 --> 03:10:10.872]  And I'm really believing you, the government, you gotta have control of it!
[03:10:11.892 --> 03:10:15.636]  You know, that guy killed those kids in that school just recently.
[03:10:15.636 --> 03:10:23.346]  If I was the president, I would have put him on a bus and put his whole body up there and hung him upside down, straight out.
[03:10:23.346 --> 03:10:24.207]  And they're going to do it.
[03:10:24.207 --> 03:10:28.692]  He's going to do in jail, and they're going to take 15 years to give him time and just sit and rot.
[03:10:28.692 --> 03:10:30.174]  I'm going to rot all right.
[03:10:30.174 --> 03:10:31.615]  Killed those innocent kids.
[03:10:32.156 --> 03:10:34.398]  But see, they use that and dangle them out in front of us.
[03:10:34.398 --> 03:10:47.949]  Meanwhile, the President signs weekly the death orders, where they'll blow up a whole apartment building, or a whole village, or a whole wedding, to get one guy who hadn't even been convicted, illegally bombing another country, and they blow those little kids' arms and legs off, and Obama didn't cry about that.
[03:10:47.949 --> 03:10:49.670]  My point is, they're cold-blooded.
[03:10:49.670 --> 03:10:53.714]  Did you know our government runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria now, publicly?
[03:10:53.714 --> 03:10:56.016]  And Obama went in and murdered Gaddafi.
[03:10:56.843 --> 03:11:01.193]  And again, he wasn't a perfect guy, but compared to Al-Qaeda, he'd been friends with the West for about a decade.
[03:11:01.193 --> 03:11:03.097]  You know, Gaddafi was in... I believe that.
[03:11:03.097 --> 03:11:05.342]  I believe he just did that to get where he got.
[03:11:05.342 --> 03:11:05.864]  Where he's at.
[03:11:07.045 --> 03:11:09.926]  He did that to talk to the people just like when I did.
[03:11:09.926 --> 03:11:15.909]  I didn't know what Alex Jones teaching me about what's on TV, but I seen it with my own eyes.
[03:11:15.909 --> 03:11:18.471]  You pulled it up on YouTube or the TV thing.
[03:11:18.471 --> 03:11:19.391]  Obama lying?
[03:11:19.391 --> 03:11:20.672]  Right, and it came up.
[03:11:20.672 --> 03:11:23.533]  That was Obama saying what he won't do with the taxes.
[03:11:23.533 --> 03:11:30.257]  Here I am, just got a job as a maid, and my first check is eating me the taxes, eating the hell out of me.
[03:11:30.257 --> 03:11:31.497]  First check.
[03:11:31.497 --> 03:11:32.378]  It's going up.
[03:11:32.378 --> 03:11:33.478]  It's going up.
[03:11:33.478 --> 03:11:34.819]  But- He said he wouldn't do that.
[03:11:35.509 --> 03:11:38.111]  I've seen it right here on your show, Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:38.111 --> 03:11:39.712]  He said he wouldn't take the taxes.
[03:11:39.712 --> 03:11:44.816]  But, exactly, but just 20 years ago, if a president did that, they got run out on a rail.
[03:11:44.816 --> 03:11:46.137]  Right.
[03:11:46.137 --> 03:11:47.979]  There's some, you wanted to cover some coke for you, huh?
[03:11:47.979 --> 03:11:48.940]  You bet.
[03:11:48.940 --> 03:11:50.141]  And, well, let's go to calls.
[03:11:50.141 --> 03:11:52.522]  I'm going to quit hogging her hair.
[03:11:52.522 --> 03:11:53.823]  Let's go to Mike in Tennessee.
[03:11:53.823 --> 03:11:55.205]  You're on the air, listening on 1600 WMQM.
[03:11:55.205 --> 03:11:56.025]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:11:58.686 --> 03:12:00.727]  Good afternoon, Alex and Michelle.
[03:12:00.727 --> 03:12:19.538]  First, I just real quick want to say, Michelle, if you haven't seen the Obama Deception documentary, I highly recommend that Alex get you a copy of that, as well as all of his other documentaries, a year's subscription to his magazine, as well as access to InfoWars TV that she can view from any computer anywhere, including the public libraries.
[03:12:21.067 --> 03:12:21.627]  Absolutely.
[03:12:21.627 --> 03:12:23.308]  In fact, you see that magazine there?
[03:12:23.308 --> 03:12:26.409]  That was the December issue that we finished the last week of November.
[03:12:26.409 --> 03:12:31.531]  It says this man wants your guns and it says he's going to use executive orders to come after our guns.
[03:12:31.531 --> 03:12:32.311]  How do you think I knew that?
[03:12:32.311 --> 03:12:34.132]  Because I'm not smart.
[03:12:34.132 --> 03:12:35.472]  They told us they would do all this.
[03:12:35.472 --> 03:12:36.753]  They said that.
[03:12:36.753 --> 03:12:41.895]  I've just seen them said it on the TV at Alex Jones Show that he wouldn't raise our taxes.
[03:12:42.603 --> 03:12:45.544]  Exactly, but back then it was only in policy reports.
[03:12:45.544 --> 03:12:48.405]  See, they're in policy reports like we don't even exist.
[03:12:48.405 --> 03:12:54.087]  Because they know the paid-off media will never go show their real plans.
[03:12:54.087 --> 03:12:55.527]  So see, that's why I get so mad.
[03:12:55.527 --> 03:12:56.968]  I know their whole plan.
[03:12:57.668 --> 03:12:59.669]  Because they wrote it down.
[03:12:59.669 --> 03:13:01.530]  This is not rocket science.
[03:13:01.530 --> 03:13:03.671]  I know what I'm talking about because they told me.
[03:13:03.671 --> 03:13:05.191]  It's like a confession letter.
[03:13:05.191 --> 03:13:08.553]  It's like a killer who videotapes themselves chopping up some kid.
[03:13:08.553 --> 03:13:10.334]  And I've got the video and I'm like, look, he did it.
[03:13:10.334 --> 03:13:11.294]  Here's the video.
[03:13:11.294 --> 03:13:13.035]  Oh, shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[03:13:13.035 --> 03:13:13.655]  I'm sorry.
[03:13:13.655 --> 03:13:14.216]  Go ahead.
[03:13:14.216 --> 03:13:14.896]  Anything else, Mike?
[03:13:16.929 --> 03:13:25.579]  Michelle, I'm 51 and I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, and I grew up in a neighborhood that had black fathers and white fathers that went to work.
[03:13:25.579 --> 03:13:29.604]  Some were carpenters, some were dentists, some were trash men.
[03:13:29.604 --> 03:13:36.572]  They came home every night to a house with a wife who'd beat the fool out of the young boys if they got out of line, and if they were at the neighbor's home,
[03:13:37.012 --> 03:13:39.034]  The neighbor's mom will get a hold of you.
[03:13:39.034 --> 03:13:39.855]  Call your mother.
[03:13:39.855 --> 03:13:41.076]  When you got home, she would get you.
[03:13:41.076 --> 03:13:43.238]  And when dad got home, it was all over.
[03:13:43.238 --> 03:13:50.384]  The way they stole your birthright was they took the fathers out of the home, replaced them with a welfare check, and they... Hallelujah.
[03:13:50.384 --> 03:13:51.265]  Hallelujah.
[03:13:51.265 --> 03:13:52.526]  You're exactly right.
[03:13:52.526 --> 03:14:03.596]  And by the way, Margaret Sanger said, we're going to get these black weeds, this is a quote, we're going to pay off black leaders, and we're going to break up their families, and we're going to get them dependent, and we're going to chop them up.
[03:14:04.642 --> 03:14:12.310]  Okay, and that's what goes on, and what they've done, like Tony Brown says in Tony Brown's journal on PBS, what they've done to the black community is the model for everybody.
[03:14:12.310 --> 03:14:19.937]  They just went after you because people would say, oh well, they don't have rights, you know, because they use prejudice to hit you from both sides.
[03:14:19.937 --> 03:14:22.499]  The open prejudice, but then the fake liberals
[03:14:23.601 --> 03:14:24.541]  That's their plan.
[03:14:24.541 --> 03:14:30.803]  And so my whole point is, is that they've gone from 10% illegitimacy to 90 plus percent illegitimacy.
[03:14:30.803 --> 03:14:34.604]  And Dr. Spock in those books, they said, don't spank your kids.
[03:14:34.604 --> 03:14:36.625]  They said, let your kids do what they want.
[03:14:36.625 --> 03:14:38.845]  So they'll be out of control.
[03:14:38.845 --> 03:14:40.866]  So now they get tasered and shot by the cops.
[03:14:40.866 --> 03:14:45.207]  Now their father figure is a big fat fake gangster.
[03:14:46.267 --> 03:14:49.689]  Like Freeway Ricky Ross, not the real Freeway Ricky.
[03:14:49.689 --> 03:14:52.751]  Rick Ross, the fake guy, not even a real gangster.
[03:14:52.751 --> 03:14:55.012]  By the way, he runs and hides from real gangsters.
[03:14:55.012 --> 03:14:58.815]  He's up there saying, the tough thing to do, kill, steal, do all this.
[03:14:58.815 --> 03:15:00.676]  People think that's what they're supposed to do.
[03:15:00.676 --> 03:15:05.599]  You basically put on a gangster uniform for the cops now to alert who are trained on you.
[03:15:05.599 --> 03:15:07.640]  They're like attack dogs trained to get a rabbit.
[03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:08.921]  You put on a rabbit's uniform.
[03:15:09.161 --> 03:15:16.668]  To be sent to a prison where they then put everybody racially in their gangs to create a race system of divide and conquer.
[03:15:16.668 --> 03:15:24.595]  The real colleges in America are the prisons designed, what this guy's saying right here, to destroy the birthright, to destroy the father.
[03:15:24.595 --> 03:15:26.176]  And they've now done it.
[03:15:26.176 --> 03:15:27.677]  And they're doing it to everybody.
[03:15:27.677 --> 03:15:29.299]  And that's what Obama's there to do.
[03:15:29.299 --> 03:15:29.999]  You know Obama?
[03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:34.182]  Got all the money increased to make sure they abort more people.
[03:15:34.182 --> 03:15:35.802]  And folks say, well, look how bad the communities are.
[03:15:35.802 --> 03:15:36.963]  Let's abort these people.
[03:15:36.963 --> 03:15:38.283]  See how they've sold us on that?
[03:15:38.283 --> 03:15:40.965]  He says, hey, let's kill people.
[03:15:40.965 --> 03:15:44.326]  Because if we kill an old lady and don't give her health care, we can hire teachers.
[03:15:44.326 --> 03:15:47.167]  Now we've got the idea of killing people, we get a job.
[03:15:47.167 --> 03:15:51.269]  When all we ever needed was liberty and freedom and self-sufficiency.
[03:15:51.269 --> 03:15:53.750]  But now we've had the self-sufficiency destroyed.
[03:15:53.750 --> 03:15:55.531]  Now they've got us right where they want us, Michelle.
[03:15:56.950 --> 03:15:59.092]  They think they do.
[03:15:59.092 --> 03:16:14.461]  Their biggest fear is independence and people taking individual responsibility and once you give up the Obama phone bobble, you take back your rightful place as a sovereign human being, a child of God, they lose.
[03:16:14.461 --> 03:16:15.262]  Right.
[03:16:15.262 --> 03:16:15.742]  They lose.
[03:16:19.976 --> 03:16:24.719]  I mean Mitt Romney's trying to talk to mainline, middle class people, whatever color they are.
[03:16:24.719 --> 03:16:25.639]  He's like, I don't care about 47%.
[03:16:25.639 --> 03:16:27.640]  They're going to do whatever.
[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:30.922]  He goes, I'll keep your taxes low.
[03:16:30.922 --> 03:16:32.703]  But his plan was to raise them too.
[03:16:32.703 --> 03:16:38.346]  He's there to con the middle class and the white people and the wealthy black folks and all the people that have made some money.
[03:16:38.346 --> 03:16:41.327]  Get the government in their friend.
[03:16:41.327 --> 03:16:46.410]  But he'll tell them what they want to hear, and then they can put Obama in and say it's a defeat.
[03:16:47.190 --> 03:16:50.735]  For the ideas Mitt Romney put out that weren't his real plans.
[03:16:50.735 --> 03:16:50.956]  Right.
[03:16:50.956 --> 03:16:54.601]  You see, it wasn't just rigged in getting Obama in.
[03:16:55.365 --> 03:16:59.847]  Okay, it was rigged in that they ran somebody who was a phony up against him to begin with.
[03:16:59.847 --> 03:17:02.788]  Because they want you to believe in the system.
[03:17:02.788 --> 03:17:06.109]  Because it's not enough for them to steal your future.
[03:17:06.109 --> 03:17:07.650]  They want you to beg for it.
[03:17:07.650 --> 03:17:08.510]  You understand that?
[03:17:08.510 --> 03:17:09.610]  Right, right, right.
[03:17:09.610 --> 03:17:10.451]  I do believe that.
[03:17:10.451 --> 03:17:12.271]  Because it's free will universe.
[03:17:12.271 --> 03:17:13.172]  Right.
[03:17:13.172 --> 03:17:17.293]  And I'm not trying to preach at you, but I wanted to get you here because I could tell you're an interesting lady.
[03:17:17.293 --> 03:17:17.894]  Right.
[03:17:17.894 --> 03:17:20.575]  And I really wanted to communicate with you at point blank range.
[03:17:20.575 --> 03:17:21.355]  And I'm glad you did.
[03:17:22.156 --> 03:17:22.977]  Sir, good points.
[03:17:22.977 --> 03:17:24.918]  Let's get another caller here in overdrive.
[03:17:24.918 --> 03:17:27.260]  We're going to skip this network break coming up.
[03:17:27.260 --> 03:17:28.381]  Key in New York.
[03:17:28.381 --> 03:17:28.961]  You're on the air.
[03:17:28.961 --> 03:17:31.223]  Go ahead.
[03:17:31.223 --> 03:17:32.724]  Hey, how you doing, Michelle?
[03:17:32.724 --> 03:17:34.425]  Hey, how are you?
[03:17:34.425 --> 03:17:36.006]  What's going on, Alex?
[03:17:36.006 --> 03:17:37.407]  Worldwide broadcast, my friend.
[03:17:37.407 --> 03:17:38.048]  What's on your mind?
[03:17:38.533 --> 03:17:40.475]  Yo, you know something, Michelle?
[03:17:40.475 --> 03:17:43.498]  The only reason why you're there is to be clowned.
[03:17:43.498 --> 03:17:45.559]  That's the only reason why you're there.
[03:17:45.559 --> 03:17:54.708]  Before you got there, they played that soundbite of yours over and over and over again to clown you.
[03:17:54.708 --> 03:18:03.656]  And the reason why he's trying to get you to say things is because he needs audio so that he can play that back and clown you again when you leave.
[03:18:04.885 --> 03:18:07.366]  Now hold on just a second, Key.
[03:18:07.366 --> 03:18:32.552]  Ain't nobody going to... But hold on, when we called her and when she got off the plane I said I think it's funny and you know we did make jokes about it because it's funny but it's also sad and I said that at the time we aired it if you go back to the first times we aired it and I said I thought she was an interesting lady and was talented and funny and and and and I've said I bet that lady's a character so we've got her here
[03:18:33.292 --> 03:18:35.454]  And you know I clown around some too.
[03:18:35.454 --> 03:18:42.220]  So it's so all I'm saying is don't misrepresent what I actually stand for and for and what I believe in.
[03:18:42.220 --> 03:18:53.190]  I mean it is horrible that they're trying to domesticate us and I'm here actually trying to reach out to her to try to explain to her why we need a second amendment and things like that.
[03:18:54.013 --> 03:19:03.226]  Okay, and obviously I said I want that lady on the show months ago, and then I made kind of a joke about it saying, okay, a bounty to get her on and somebody can find her, and we got her on.
[03:19:03.226 --> 03:19:04.709]  Is this not interesting radio, sir?
[03:19:05.390 --> 03:19:11.553]  No, he's trying to clown you, and I can prove it to you that he isn't what he purports to be.
[03:19:11.553 --> 03:19:13.474]  You calling Obama a punk?
[03:19:13.474 --> 03:19:14.935]  Well, check this out.
[03:19:14.935 --> 03:19:22.538]  Alex said that you had 1776 all in Piers Morgan's face.
[03:19:22.538 --> 03:19:25.860]  Oh, you're not going to take our guns because this is going to happen.
[03:19:25.860 --> 03:19:32.243]  All of a sudden, Alex said if the ATF shows up at his house, he's not going to shoot back.
[03:19:32.243 --> 03:19:33.804]  You know, but the Ruby Ridgecats,
[03:19:34.585 --> 03:19:36.045]  They went for this.
[03:19:36.045 --> 03:19:40.306]  Now they died, but they did what they said they were going to do.
[03:19:40.306 --> 03:19:41.486]  But Alex said no.
[03:19:41.486 --> 03:19:44.807]  He's dropping to his knees.
[03:19:44.807 --> 03:19:47.327]  You know what?
[03:19:47.327 --> 03:19:49.328]  You're wrong and I appreciate your call.
[03:19:49.328 --> 03:19:58.590]  And I am here on the front lines trying to peacefully cause a cultural revolution 1776 worldwide.
[03:20:00.669 --> 03:20:04.010]  And I know that they want to come set me up.
[03:20:04.010 --> 03:20:06.291]  And so I've always said the same thing.
[03:20:06.291 --> 03:20:10.313]  If you come for the guns, it's going to cause a revolution.
[03:20:10.313 --> 03:20:13.475]  But I'm not going to give them an excuse before that happens.
[03:20:13.475 --> 03:20:14.375]  A. I want to stop it.
[03:20:14.375 --> 03:20:15.195]  I've been clear about that.
[03:20:15.195 --> 03:20:15.215]  B.
[03:20:18.090 --> 03:20:22.913]  I am trying to fix things peacefully, and I'm not going to give them the excuse.
[03:20:22.913 --> 03:20:26.035]  I have said I'm not turning my guns in, period.
[03:20:26.035 --> 03:20:38.123]  I don't care what phony executive orders they do, but I've also said that I'm not going to open the door for them that if they do come to my house and kill me, to sit there and have me shooting my mouth off that I'm going to do this and that to the cops.
[03:20:38.123 --> 03:20:41.366]  If they do come and kill me, it'll be in cold blood and I'll be a martyr.
[03:20:41.366 --> 03:20:42.446]  That's the opposite.
[03:20:43.507 --> 03:20:52.450]  I mean, I'm Alex Jones, on the air, I don't have bodyguards, I go out and do all this, I deal with this and you're calling up saying that basically I'm a coward.
[03:20:52.450 --> 03:20:55.691]  And anyone listening knows that that's not the case.
[03:20:55.691 --> 03:20:58.292]  I mean, I march into the lion's den and get in people's face.
[03:21:00.916 --> 03:21:01.676]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[03:21:01.676 --> 03:21:04.658]  Instead of just making fun of this lady from afar, I got her.
[03:21:04.658 --> 03:21:06.378]  Did I not tell you last night?
[03:21:06.378 --> 03:21:07.579]  What did I tell you when you got off the plane?
[03:21:07.579 --> 03:21:09.220]  Well, it's not about what you said.
[03:21:09.220 --> 03:21:12.381]  I been did it before I got to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:12.381 --> 03:21:18.483]  I even had my TV show in Cleveland, Ohio, Channel 19, and I turned them down.
[03:21:18.483 --> 03:21:25.726]  But one thing about it, and two, for sure, if you see it with your own eyes and then you know what you did, you know it's a gang.
[03:21:25.726 --> 03:21:29.108]  He did that probably to get me out there to get the voters to vote for him.
[03:21:29.588 --> 03:21:33.089]  No, I know, but I mean, obviously, it's hilarious.
[03:21:33.089 --> 03:21:35.830]  I mean, I think it's funny because it's funny.
[03:21:35.830 --> 03:21:39.652]  But I mean, I said on air, I've said it to you, I said you could do voiceovers.
[03:21:39.652 --> 03:21:41.292]  I mean, that's like a muppet comedian.
[03:21:41.292 --> 03:21:42.673]  That's like a muppet character.
[03:21:42.673 --> 03:21:44.173]  I mean, I'm going to be honest with you, right?
[03:21:44.173 --> 03:21:45.734]  I'm telling you where your talents are.
[03:21:45.734 --> 03:21:48.595]  When you get upset and talk, I mean, it sounds like a muppet.
[03:21:48.595 --> 03:21:51.996]  I mean, I mean, you could go make money as a muppet.
[03:21:51.996 --> 03:21:54.116]  OK, I'm OK with that.
[03:21:54.116 --> 03:21:56.057]  But listen, the point is I do.
[03:21:56.057 --> 03:21:58.218]  The thing is, I do Marvin the Martian voices.
[03:21:58.678 --> 03:21:59.338]  Right.
[03:21:59.338 --> 03:22:00.479]  I can do Muppet voices.
[03:22:00.479 --> 03:22:03.240]  I mean, I'm saying, I said at the time, that's an interesting lady.
[03:22:03.240 --> 03:22:07.541]  There's plenty of people on the news saying, I want Obama in because I want free stuff.
[03:22:07.541 --> 03:22:09.082]  We've played like 10 clips of that.
[03:22:09.082 --> 03:22:13.203]  None of those got 20 million views because they didn't have that spark.
[03:22:13.203 --> 03:22:14.264]  That spark!
[03:22:14.264 --> 03:22:25.408]  And everybody told me, even when I got on the news, even when I got on YouTube, first thing they said, oh wow, you were so funny, the way you said it.
[03:22:25.408 --> 03:22:27.669]  You have your phone, and you can do more!
[03:22:28.547 --> 03:22:34.333]  You know, that was... But didn't I tell you that I thought it was funny and that I disagreed with it?
[03:22:34.333 --> 03:22:35.354]  Oh yeah!
[03:22:35.354 --> 03:22:36.776]  And I told John to tell you that on the phone.
[03:22:36.776 --> 03:22:39.799]  Well see, when I... What did we tell you about getting... I mean, we were honest about it.
[03:22:39.799 --> 03:22:40.179]  Right.
[03:22:40.179 --> 03:22:46.326]  The point is, my attackers always obsess on saying, I'm not bonafide, I'm not real, I'm disingenuous.
[03:22:46.326 --> 03:22:47.467]  When it's the opposite...
[03:22:49.309 --> 03:22:50.910]  Alex Jones Show!
[03:22:50.910 --> 03:22:51.811]  You're real?
[03:22:51.811 --> 03:22:53.252]  That's what I like, is things that are real.
[03:22:53.252 --> 03:22:58.816]  Then if you don't know, a man like you showed me, sitting in his office.
[03:22:58.816 --> 03:23:02.699]  Well, exactly, and, and, and, and, and, I mean, She wasn't gonna raise and cut my taxes.
[03:23:02.699 --> 03:23:04.120]  You know why you're here?
[03:23:04.120 --> 03:23:05.001]  Because when I met...
[03:23:06.917 --> 03:23:11.199]  Literally having Thanksgiving or Christmas, we're sitting around talking about you.
[03:23:11.199 --> 03:23:12.000]  Uh-huh.
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:13.621]  And everybody... You're the only one.
[03:23:13.621 --> 03:23:15.742]  Everybody's talking about the bomb-a-phone lady.
[03:23:15.742 --> 03:23:17.023]  That's why I'm gonna get... I know.
[03:23:17.023 --> 03:23:19.784]  So the guy's trying to make it some evil thing to get you here.
[03:23:19.784 --> 03:23:20.805]  A lot of people is.
[03:23:20.805 --> 03:23:22.986]  A lot of people saying I showed my butt doing this.
[03:23:23.146 --> 03:23:24.687]  Well, the point is, is that so what?
[03:23:24.687 --> 03:23:26.128]  You were in the arena.
[03:23:26.128 --> 03:23:27.068]  Wait a minute.
[03:23:27.068 --> 03:23:28.509]  You were on the field.
[03:23:28.509 --> 03:23:37.234]  If I die tomorrow, my grandkids can go on YouTube and say, my granny did something on YouTube, Obama phone lady.
[03:23:37.234 --> 03:23:39.015]  Well, let me be clear too.
[03:23:39.015 --> 03:23:39.396]  I don't...
[03:23:40.336 --> 03:23:43.340]  The family I come from, my family's all like, you better be nice to that lady.
[03:23:43.340 --> 03:23:44.561]  And I'm like, how dare you?
[03:23:44.561 --> 03:23:46.764]  You were on the phone with my wife last night.
[03:23:46.764 --> 03:23:49.427]  Don't say I'm on purpose trying to be mean to her.
[03:23:49.427 --> 03:23:53.371]  I mean, I said, obviously, obviously, I don't agree with what they've done.
[03:23:53.371 --> 03:23:55.794]  I don't agree with getting free Obama phones.
[03:23:55.794 --> 03:23:58.197]  It's selling our souls so cheaply.
[03:23:58.197 --> 03:24:00.019]  I'm here telling you honestly, I think this is horrible.
[03:24:00.419 --> 03:24:08.481]  And you're here, understanding what I'm saying, and we're trying to figure out ways for- But you just said it- I fight as hard as I can to try to keep jobs in this country.
[03:24:08.481 --> 03:24:19.983]  But just now you showed that clipping of, and that's so true, just like you, he just showed us how we get a, what you call it, happy meal, a cheeseburger and a fry.
[03:24:19.983 --> 03:24:23.264]  I'm black, low class, low po.
[03:24:23.264 --> 03:24:28.445]  Obama lady, instead of buying a happy meal, a cheeseburger and a fry for two bucks,
[03:24:29.105 --> 03:24:36.348]  That toy, they'd probably get a million of them, pay one price, throw it in the bag, and the kid is happy.
[03:24:36.348 --> 03:24:37.589]  That's the example.
[03:24:37.589 --> 03:24:39.129]  Same thing for me.
[03:24:39.129 --> 03:24:47.873]  They threw me an Obama phone, and more than us, and so many minorities that I helped sign up to vote for Obama bought that Obama phone.
[03:24:47.873 --> 03:24:49.394]  They didn't even come from Obama.
[03:24:50.123 --> 03:24:56.766]  So I made myself look stupid because when I was canvassing, they didn't tell me about the Obama phone.
[03:24:56.766 --> 03:25:02.949]  If I never went to a canvass for Obama, first thing everybody I know say, they call him Obama phone.
[03:25:02.949 --> 03:25:03.529]  Exactly.
[03:25:03.529 --> 03:25:09.492]  What they want is they want to get everybody on the dole so these big mega banks can skim and decide where the contracts go.
[03:25:09.492 --> 03:25:10.853]  It's all mafia.
[03:25:10.853 --> 03:25:12.674]  Let me go over some of these questions or people are going to kill me.
[03:25:12.674 --> 03:25:14.295]  I've got a whole, where do they go?
[03:25:14.295 --> 03:25:15.135]  Here they are.
[03:25:15.135 --> 03:25:16.676]  These are Twitter questions from real Alex Jones.
[03:25:18.223 --> 03:25:21.506]  Why and what made you go on the Alex Jones Show?
[03:25:21.506 --> 03:25:24.289]  Why'd you say no to the other shows but you said yes to ours?
[03:25:24.289 --> 03:25:39.003]  Well for one I said yes to Alex Jones Show because when you called me and talked to me there was a man that approached, excuse me, approached me so you had already been looking for me and here I am in Cleveland and you're in Texas!
[03:25:39.963 --> 03:25:45.485]  They was right there in Cleveland looking for me, and no one came to me like you did, Alex Jones.
[03:25:45.485 --> 03:25:54.529]  And I don't care how stupid the video look, or whatever they said about the video, you was the first one made me feel welcome, and to learn more about what's going on.
[03:25:54.529 --> 03:25:58.991]  Well, the thing is, you're a real person, you're funny, you're talented, and you have that pizazz.
[03:25:58.991 --> 03:26:05.053]  But yeah, it's horrible what's happening, how they're buying us off of this stuff, and trying to make us dependent where there are no jobs, so you gotta go on welfare.
[03:26:05.053 --> 03:26:05.994]  This is all we talk about.
[03:26:06.314 --> 03:26:14.436]  I mean, you know, here I am talking about, let's not let the eugenicists target black people, and this guy calls up and says, you know, you're clowning this lady.
[03:26:14.436 --> 03:26:19.797]  And obviously, we're all... But I wanted to say what I really wanted to tell him, and you wouldn't let me tell him.
[03:26:19.797 --> 03:26:20.237]  What was that?
[03:26:20.237 --> 03:26:20.637]  Go ahead.
[03:26:20.637 --> 03:26:29.538]  Well, if he wanted to clown me, but you gotta also look at it as, same thing they did it to get his votes, and like you did about the bag they threw the toy in.
[03:26:29.538 --> 03:26:30.739]  We're all getting clowned.
[03:26:30.739 --> 03:26:31.899]  We all getting clowned.
[03:26:32.259 --> 03:26:36.001]  I'm Obama phone lady, and if I got clowned by that, guess what?
[03:26:36.001 --> 03:26:38.602]  I'm gonna get what I need to get through.
[03:26:38.602 --> 03:26:39.942]  That's the main thing.
[03:26:39.942 --> 03:26:41.703]  And to know the right from the wrong.
[03:26:41.703 --> 03:26:43.984]  Only people that don't get clowned are folks that don't ever do anything.
[03:26:43.984 --> 03:26:44.464]  Right.
[03:26:44.464 --> 03:26:46.025]  And see, I do a lot.
[03:26:46.025 --> 03:26:50.566]  I'm right now, like I said, I'm a single parent with five kids.
[03:26:50.566 --> 03:26:51.447]  I do a lot.
[03:26:51.447 --> 03:26:53.087]  And I need to get through a lot.
[03:26:53.087 --> 03:26:53.848]  I'm 47 years old.
[03:26:53.848 --> 03:26:55.168]  How long we last?
[03:26:55.168 --> 03:26:56.129]  We don't last long.
[03:26:57.328 --> 03:27:04.613]  And I don't care what you said about that car, because whatever it took on you, too, you've seen it, and if I look like that much of a fool, where you at?
[03:27:04.613 --> 03:27:05.613]  You're a fool with me.
[03:27:05.613 --> 03:27:09.676]  But again, there's lots of people begging for, you know, saying, I got this free thing.
[03:27:09.676 --> 03:27:10.937]  Those didn't get popular.
[03:27:10.937 --> 03:27:12.578]  It's because it's funny.
[03:27:12.578 --> 03:27:14.419]  And it's funny because of the way you deliver it.
[03:27:14.419 --> 03:27:15.079]  Now, there's another one.
[03:27:15.079 --> 03:27:17.501]  Why do you think he's paying for that phone?
[03:27:18.578 --> 03:27:21.440]  Do you think it's fair that they take money from somebody else?
[03:27:21.440 --> 03:27:22.460]  No, I don't.
[03:27:22.460 --> 03:27:26.803]  They could have used that money to get me a gun and a grenade to help save my soul.
[03:27:26.803 --> 03:27:29.304]  Come to me to blow me down.
[03:27:29.304 --> 03:27:31.646]  Don't buy my phone, lady.
[03:27:31.646 --> 03:27:33.087]  You're something else.
[03:27:33.087 --> 03:27:34.067]  Oh my gosh.
[03:27:34.067 --> 03:27:35.148]  You gotta be like that.
[03:27:35.148 --> 03:27:37.690]  You see how that caller just did us?
[03:27:37.690 --> 03:27:38.610]  Here's that same question.
[03:27:38.610 --> 03:27:39.511]  Do you want a free firearm?
[03:27:39.511 --> 03:27:40.851]  I haven't even read these yet.
[03:27:40.851 --> 03:27:44.133]  How do you feel about the tax increases on more than 77% of Americans?
[03:27:44.133 --> 03:27:45.414]  We already talked about that.
[03:27:45.414 --> 03:27:46.615]  Who are you going to vote for in 2016?
[03:27:48.829 --> 03:27:51.610]  It darn sure won't be Obama.
[03:27:51.610 --> 03:27:53.431]  I don't know, they're talking about a third term for him.
[03:27:53.431 --> 03:27:55.072]  Well, I don't think he's gonna last that long.
[03:27:55.072 --> 03:27:57.573]  I mean, Rahm Emanuel says we don't even need voters anymore.
[03:27:57.573 --> 03:27:57.793]  Right.
[03:27:57.793 --> 03:27:59.433]  We just, the police will now run things.
[03:27:59.433 --> 03:28:05.416]  Right, and I do believe that, because where I live at, and where I was at, the police is running it.
[03:28:05.416 --> 03:28:13.059]  And I've seen it with my own eyes, and I'm glad you brought a lot to my attention about that, because I've just moved from Cleveland Heights to Cleveland.
[03:28:13.479 --> 03:28:15.940]  Cleveland, you can walk outside butt-naked!
[03:28:15.940 --> 03:28:21.341]  You go to Cleveland Heights, they're gonna arrest you, say you raped somebody, because you're butt-naked!
[03:28:21.341 --> 03:28:23.662]  The police is running it all.
[03:28:23.662 --> 03:28:32.625]  You know, years ago, my father, dead and gone, he told me it was gonna be people on the devices on the TV that they can look through you and see where you at.
[03:28:32.625 --> 03:28:36.566]  I believe that, because now they got them things they put on kids' legs and they look through the TV.
[03:28:36.566 --> 03:28:37.326]  No, no, no.
[03:28:37.326 --> 03:28:39.587]  Your Obama phone tracks everywhere you go.
[03:28:39.587 --> 03:28:40.167]  I believe that.
[03:28:40.167 --> 03:28:41.608]  They dial in and listen to you.
[03:28:41.608 --> 03:28:42.888]  No, it's horrible.
[03:28:43.228 --> 03:28:47.030]  They control you because they give you so many minutes a month.
[03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:48.491]  Do something!
[03:28:48.491 --> 03:28:49.211]  Here's another caller.
[03:28:49.211 --> 03:28:50.432]  The most incredible voice.
[03:28:50.432 --> 03:28:56.095]  Are you getting job offers for TV, radio, voiceovers, etc?
[03:28:56.095 --> 03:28:59.677]  It says you way better than Piers Morgan.
[03:28:59.677 --> 03:29:01.097]  Thanks for the comment.
[03:29:01.097 --> 03:29:03.559]  By the way, folks, I'm telling you, she needs her agent.
[03:29:03.559 --> 03:29:05.140]  She needs to do voiceovers.
[03:29:05.140 --> 03:29:06.740]  I guess I'm evil because I'm trying to help her.
[03:29:06.740 --> 03:29:07.501]  Send me your agent out.
[03:29:09.244 --> 03:29:11.146]  Have you heard about FEMA camps?
[03:29:11.146 --> 03:29:12.087]  Yes, I did.
[03:29:12.087 --> 03:29:14.128]  I used FEMA before.
[03:29:14.128 --> 03:29:17.692]  FEMA is the one to help you if you say your flood is in the basement.
[03:29:17.692 --> 03:29:19.573]  But they're also the shadow government.
[03:29:19.573 --> 03:29:20.454]  They're with the government.
[03:29:20.454 --> 03:29:22.536]  Do you take the flu shot?
[03:29:22.536 --> 03:29:23.497]  No.
[03:29:23.497 --> 03:29:24.458]  Why?
[03:29:24.458 --> 03:29:27.040]  I got faith in God gonna heal me.
[03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:28.482]  Well, it never even protects you anyways.
[03:29:28.482 --> 03:29:28.802]  Right.
[03:29:28.802 --> 03:29:29.182]  Total fraud.
[03:29:29.182 --> 03:29:29.663]  I don't take it.
[03:29:30.370 --> 03:29:33.452]  We're going to do more of these questions tonight on the TV show.
[03:29:33.452 --> 03:29:33.852]  All right, now.
[03:29:33.852 --> 03:29:35.874]  I'm going to let you get some late lunch.
[03:29:35.874 --> 03:29:36.795]  All right.
[03:29:36.795 --> 03:29:42.939]  And we're going to go back to retransmission, covering news from the earlier broadcast here.
[03:29:42.939 --> 03:29:44.460]  And I'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
[03:29:44.460 --> 03:29:45.721]  Central.
[03:29:45.721 --> 03:29:51.385]  A lot more tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv, with Obama Phone Lady.
[03:29:51.385 --> 03:29:53.066]  All right, Obama Phone Lady's here!
[03:29:53.066 --> 03:29:56.949]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.949 --> 03:29:59.631]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
