[00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:12.876]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars news alert.
[00:00:13.297 --> 00:00:19.701]  Florida Sheriff Nick Finch has been suspended following outrage from the governor that the sheriff allegedly helped a man escape jail.
[00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:25.104]  The allegations claim the sheriff destroyed documents concerning a man arrested on a weapons charge.
[00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:29.307]  The sheriff contends that he was only respecting the man's Second Amendment rights.
[00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.474]  We've had many constitutional sheriffs in our programming, including Sheriff David Clark and also Sheriff Richard Mack.
[00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:41.299]  Gun control in the United States of America is against the law.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.084]  And for some of these elected sheriffs that are saying we would not, who is part of what, what branch am I?
[00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:48.145]  Executive branch.
[00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:51.276]  Your job is to enforce the law as fast!
[00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:55.598]  To say we don't have to keep our oaths, we just have to enforce whatever the federal government says.
[00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:56.999]  That's an absolute lie.
[00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.781]  And for more on this topic, you can stop by the InfoWars shop and pick up Sheriff Max's The Magic of Gun Control.
