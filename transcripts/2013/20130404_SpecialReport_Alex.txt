[00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:05.341]  Hello, I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo with an InfoWars
[00:00:07.483 --> 00:00:14.368]  Conspiracy theory is being used by the mainstream media to discredit genuine concerns citizens may have surrounding political events.
[00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:20.452]  Well folks, if you find that your questions are being answered with facts, it's not a theory at all.
[00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:21.813]  It's a conspiracy.
[00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:26.156]  Today is the perfect day to draw attention to one conspiracy in particular.
[00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:34.142]  On this day, April 4th, 1968, the government played part in a secret plan to assassinate the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:41.352]  Now that's not my zany conclusion, but according to our legal system, that's a fact.
[00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:49.438]  In 1999, in Shelby County, Tennessee, Lloyd Jowers was tried before a jury of his peers on the charge of conspiring to kill Dr. King.
[00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:55.442]  Conspiracy with agents of the city of Memphis and the governments of the state of Tennessee and the United States of America.
[00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:58.604]  We ask you to find that conspiracy existed.
[00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:01.306]  It only took the jury two hours to reach their verdict.
[00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:06.707]  Lloyd Jowers and others, including governmental agencies, were parties to this conspiracy.
[00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:20.990]  Just days after the trial ended, media outlets like the New York Times seemingly attempted to sway public opinion by dismissing the verdict, saying the evidence presented was sometimes contradictory and confusing, as most secret plans often are.
[00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:29.012]  But in America, where the law of the land is trial by jury, even if you feel that the jury has made a mistake, the verdict stands.
[00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:35.090]  Of course you can challenge it, but so far no one has come forward to challenge the verdict in a court of law.
[00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.258]  For more information on this conspiracy and others, visit the InfoWars store and pick up a copy of Dead Wrong by Richard Belzer and David Wayne.
