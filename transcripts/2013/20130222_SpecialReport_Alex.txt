[00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:18.953]  With all the pro-military coverage in the media, it often flies under the radar that veterans are viewed as the new terror threat.
[00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:34.305]  We've seen the use of Timothy McVeigh and others, used to demonize all veterans, pushing the image of the angry disgruntled vet, charging them with felonies and labeling them terrorists for doing things such as investigating surveillance cameras and demanding the rights that they fought to protect.
[00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:38.709]  Homeland Security has lumped servicemen in with quote, right-wing extremists.
[00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.592]  And using what can best be described as bunk science, veterans are having their right to bear arms taken away.
[00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:49.876]  Even the Boy Scouts have run simulations on how to brutalize quote, disgruntled veterans.
[00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:58.741]  Telling a veteran that they are too traumatized by their military experience to own a gun is like disarming a robbery victim because they are too traumatized by their home invasion.
[00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:03.224]  Now while I do agree that there are some veterans that may not be the most sound of mind and body,
[00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:11.146]  You can say that of any in the American population, regardless of occupation, race, sex, location, or any other of many factors.
[00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:13.587]  And it's not always demonizing vets.
[00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:21.689]  Groups have worked behind the scenes to take away death benefits, trample religious freedoms, and even charge soldiers for the medals that they earned.
[00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.010]  We've heard the anecdote that soldiers of old would roll over in their graves if they had to deal with this kind of treatment.
[00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.559]  But the fact is that many veterans roll out of bed every day having to deal with these same issues.
