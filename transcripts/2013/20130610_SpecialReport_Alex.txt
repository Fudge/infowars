[00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:09.776]  I gotta say, what I am really struck by in all of this is just how insane the media is to say, um, don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:27.639]  I mean, Alex Jones has been right on so many things for so long, and he's been called a conspiracy theorist for so long on all the things that are now coming out and verified as true, that frankly, the mainstream media owes Alex Jones a massive apology.
[00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.221]  A massive apology.
[00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:38.731]  So all of the reporters out there in the mainstream media who have made fun of Alex, and they called him a conspiracy theory, and they called him a kook.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.424]  Or you know, whatever terms they use that are derogatory, they need to apologize now.
[00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.665]  It's all coming out.
[00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:50.367]  The NSA spy grid is coming out.
[00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:52.488]  We are under assault.
[00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:55.370]  We are being spied on by our own government.
[00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:58.492]  And the media needs to stop with the nonsense.
[00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:08.399]  I'm surprised that they don't even have, they should have like a Broadway special called, Don't Listen to Alex Jones.
[00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:09.680]  It would go something like,
[00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:12.923]  Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:15.105]  Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:17.207]  No one is tapping your phones.
[00:01:17.728 --> 00:01:19.229]  No one is searching your homes.
[00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.990]  Like in Boston.
[00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.072]  Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:01:22.392 --> 00:01:23.974]  Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:26.176]  Fluoride is good for your bones.
[00:01:26.637 --> 00:01:29.359]  There are no government drones.
[00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:33.728]  Just listen to NPR, cause they never go too far.
[00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.634]  Just listen to MSNBC, and give them an audience of three.
[00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:44.378]  Don't listen, don't listen, don't listen, don't listen, don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.702]  Don't listen, don't listen, don't listen, don't listen, because he's always right.
[00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:52.946]  Yeah, I've had way too much chocolate today, sorry about that.
[00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:58.509]  Uh, that's my singing debut on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.091]  You'll probably never see me again.
[00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:03.355]  Like, no more of that!
[00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:05.217]  Get the health ranger, get him off of there!
[00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.981]  Oh my God, he's turning the show into opera!
[00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.683]  Something's gone wrong!
[00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:11.264]  Get Alex back here!
[00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:14.649]  Thank God he's on an airplane right now or he'd be calling in right this minute!
