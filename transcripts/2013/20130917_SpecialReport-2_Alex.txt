[00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:19.211]  Well, we circled the Capitol here a few times, and we didn't see a good place to park, so we went eighth and ditches and parked over there.
[00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:22.292]  We got our rifles and started up here.
[00:00:22.312 --> 00:00:31.734]  We were about to walk past a federal facility, and a federal officer come out up behind us and drew his weapon.
[00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:33.678]  And ordered us to stop.
[00:00:33.738 --> 00:00:39.722]  And we wouldn't even let him show what he wanted to show out of his wallet.
[00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:40.763]  He's got a CHL.
[00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:45.867]  And he asked us if we'd mind if he removed the magazines.
[00:00:45.907 --> 00:00:47.268]  We said, go ahead.
[00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:50.370]  He checked to make sure there wasn't one chamber.
[00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:56.374]  Then there were five other officers positioned behind cars and stuff.
[00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:59.877]  And the guy in charge over there at that federal building.
[00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:05.794]  He came out and he's familiar with open carry Texas, so he was okay with everything.
[00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:12.597]  But the one that drew his weapons, he did not know that you can carry a long gun in Texas.
[00:01:12.797 --> 00:01:15.038]  And he was a federal officer or security guard?
[00:01:15.198 --> 00:01:20.040]  Well, he was wearing a blue security shirt, different than the others.
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.820]  You said DHS, sir?
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.020]  DHS.
[00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:22.581]  That's who he was with.
[00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:24.502]  That's who those two were.
[00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:31.513]  They asked for ID and we refused to provide ID.
[00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:34.520]  Most officers were okay with that.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.961]  The DHS.
[00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.460]  He had a problem with it.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.261]  So let me clarify, sir.
[00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:45.043]  You're saying that the DHS officer, the Department of Homeland Security officer, is the one who actually threw a pistol?
[00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:45.623]  No, no.
[00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:46.084]  Security.
[00:01:46.344 --> 00:01:47.084]  Okay, security.
[00:01:47.164 --> 00:01:48.425]  Okay, thank you.
[00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.326]  And then the Department of Homeland Security officers came after that.
[00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:53.167]  So there was two of those.
[00:01:53.207 --> 00:01:54.428]  The dark blue or DHS?
[00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:58.730]  Yeah, two of those and three of the security guys.
[00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:02.012]  And they detained us until Austin PD.
[00:02:03.092 --> 00:02:05.153]  He came and spoke with him.
[00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:09.454]  I got up to speak with him also, and he told me to sit back down.
[00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:10.934]  He just wanted to speak to him.
[00:02:11.174 --> 00:02:14.915]  Now, did you guys have your firearms on you during this time while you were detained?
[00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:15.335]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:17.396]  Okay, so they let you keep your firearms?
[00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:19.116]  They let us keep the firearms.
[00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:23.438]  They asked permission to remove the magazine, and we allowed that.
[00:02:23.558 --> 00:02:26.559]  About how long were you detained?
[00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.639]  About 20 minutes.
[00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:28.939]  20 minutes?
[00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.460]  We had to wait for Austin PD
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.242]  It was all good in the end.
[00:02:34.262 --> 00:02:40.087]  They wanted to make a big issue out of the shootings yesterday.
[00:02:40.107 --> 00:02:42.049]  Y'all shouldn't be doing that today.
[00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.340]  Our rights haven't changed from today to yesterday.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.482]  We may more so need them today than yesterday.
[00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:06.204]  Sir, what do you think about all these guns out here?
[00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:08.205]  I don't know, man.
[00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:08.785]  Don't know?
[00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:10.986]  What are they doing?
[00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:11.627]  What is this for?
[00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:13.488]  This is an open carry march.
[00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:15.889]  They're just openly carrying their rifles.
[00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.491]  to demonstrate their rights.
[00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:22.253]  They're not so much protesting any one particular event, it's just the right they have, so they're just exercising their rights.
[00:03:22.774 --> 00:03:24.574]  So do you have any thoughts about that?
[00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:25.995]  I guess if it's their right.
[00:03:26.175 --> 00:03:27.655]  What do you guys think about all these guns out here?
[00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:35.098]  I don't know man, I'm from California, where like, this whole thing, there'd be like tanks around this place, if this was in California.
[00:03:35.118 --> 00:03:39.960]  Do you think that's a good thing, that you know, they have such a strong police presence in California for events like this?
[00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:43.593]  I don't know.
[00:03:44.254 --> 00:03:58.260]  I don't have a gun and I don't shoot guns but I'm intrigued by them and they permeate our society so my point for coming down here to take a closer look is that these are just regular people like you and me and
[00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:03.200]  You know, I'm sure we can all be friends and have common ground.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.581]  Do you wish you had guns like that in France?
[00:04:06.561 --> 00:04:06.701]  No!
[00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:08.022]  We are fine without guns.
[00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:09.002]  You're fine without guns?
[00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:09.783]  Yeah.
[00:04:09.803 --> 00:04:10.423]  We don't need it.
[00:04:10.703 --> 00:04:11.243]  What is it for?
[00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:12.004]  We don't need it.
[00:04:12.104 --> 00:04:14.125]  This is a... Well, it's not even a protest.
[00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:15.845]  These people... We just have the rights here.
[00:04:15.865 --> 00:04:18.666]  In the U.S., we have something called the Second Amendment.
[00:04:18.847 --> 00:04:22.528]  It gives people the right to carry guns, like the people are doing here today.
[00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:23.088]  Uh-huh.
[00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.690]  So do you guys think that's a good thing that we have that?
[00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.570]  Do you think we should get rid of the guns?
[00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.271]  Or what do you guys think?
[00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.910]  We are not the same country so we can't judge.
[00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:32.712]  You can't judge?
[00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:32.972]  No.
[00:04:32.992 --> 00:04:34.836]  That's a respectful opinion.
