[00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:06.132]  Obamacare raises the price on everything related to health care, even the health care for the lawmakers and their staff.
[00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:12.414]  But the trick is that every American is actually paying for every lawmaker and their staff's health care.
[00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:22.619]  Right now they have an Obamacare fix that will actually include a 75% subsidy because lawmakers and staff say their insurance is too expensive without being subsidized.
[00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:30.727]  So Senator David Vitter proposed an amendment that would end subsidies for the President, VP Cabinet, Secretaries, and all political appointees.
[00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:34.350]  I think John Roberts, you know, he loves Obamacare so much.
[00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.371]  Supreme Court Justice.
[00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:36.232]  He should get it.
[00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:38.594]  Right now he's getting a federal employee subsidy.
[00:00:38.614 --> 00:00:39.976]  He's not part of Obamacare.
[00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:47.383]  So he makes the rest of America, through I think convoluted constitutional logic, he makes us get Obamacare, but he's exempt.
[00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:52.769]  Another glitch which hits Americans right in their pocketbook is the family glitch in the law.
[00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.733]  Congress defined affordable as 9.5% or less of an employee's household income.
[00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:04.716]  The error is in that it applies only to the employee and not their family.
[00:01:05.076 --> 00:01:10.520]  So if the rest of the family is not covered by the employee's insurance, they cannot get subsidized through the exchanges.
[00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:15.263]  These glitches are what happens when lawmakers like Pelosi make decisions.
[00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:20.589]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:34.143]  In the lower premium networks, families may not pay a lot per month, but their doctors that they might need later, their specialists, may not be in the network, so they'll have to pay an out-of-network fee, which will end up costing them a lot more.
[00:01:34.904 --> 00:01:40.549]  And on CNN Money, a person in California making under $17,235 a year pays $57 a month in insurance, plus out-of-pocket costs.
[00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.253]  A person making under $28,725 a year will have to fork out about $193 a month, plus out-of-pocket costs.
[00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:47.395]  Surprisingly, Wyoming has the highest premium at $516 a month.
[00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.008]  And that's just in this category for an individual.
[00:02:02.668 --> 00:02:08.895]  So what will people do when they have to make a choice between paying for their health care and paying for their car payment or their mortgage?
