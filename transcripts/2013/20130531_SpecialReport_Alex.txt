[00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:14.485]  The New World Order seems to be trampling over our rights yet again.
[00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:31.172]  Between the latest DOJ memo that is telling managers they should support LGBT functions, to the Russians being approached by the European Council and being told that they should support gay pride parades, there seems to be a worldwide bullying campaign against our core family values.
[00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:34.153]  All of that in the guise of gay rights.
[00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:41.675]  Pushing the LGBT agenda is a New World Order global attack that has gone from tolerance to coercion.
[00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:47.498]  Starting right here in the United States, the LGBT community makes up only 4% of the population.
[00:00:47.758 --> 00:00:54.562]  Keeping that in perspective, the latest directive from the DOJ reveals how out of balance our society has become.
[00:00:55.382 --> 00:00:59.585]  According to the DOJ Pride Directive, silence means disapproval.
[00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:05.598]  And you shouldn't say husband or wife because it could offend the homosexuals in your office.
[00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:08.440]  It says please use partner or significant other.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.582]  So now husband and wife are offensive?
[00:01:12.362 --> 00:01:14.584]  Isn't this hate speech against heterosexuals?
[00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:19.728]  In London they passed a law to remove husband and wife from official British documents.
[00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:22.290]  So don't be surprised if it happens in the United States.
[00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.776]  In France, they plan on removing mother and father from forms.
[00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:28.939]  Au revoir to mommy and daddy!
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.223]  It soon will be parent.
[00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:35.910]  What happened to the First Amendment liberties of the people who are straight and Christian?
[00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:47.085]  Now, not that I'm agreeing with Putin, but he does say, quote, how can they demand that we introduce their standards, or maybe we should demand they introduce our standards in their country.
[00:01:47.725 --> 00:01:52.768]  He's sticking to what 90% of the people want, which is to keep core family values.
[00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:03.476]  The hypocritical DOJ directive, LGBT inclusion at work, the seven habits of highly effective managers, needs a directive of inclusion for whistleblowers.
[00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:09.742]  Since the DOJ is so hot and heavy to make sure everybody feels included, we need a directive for whistleblowers.
[00:02:10.503 --> 00:02:11.043]  How about this?
[00:02:11.404 --> 00:02:19.452]  If an employee comes into your office, shuts the door, and says, I've been meaning to tell you this for a while, I'm a whistleblower.
[00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.130]  Be supportive and thankful that they trusted you.
[00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:26.332]  Ask them if they had been made to feel safe in the workplace.
[00:02:26.752 --> 00:02:29.534]  Let them know about DOJ Whistleblower Pride.
