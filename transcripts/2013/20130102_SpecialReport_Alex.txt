[00:00:06.744 --> 00:00:09.126]  Aaron Dykes here on January 1st, 2013.
[00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:15.131]  Now Alex Jones talked on the show today about how the system views us as human resources.
[00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:21.776]  And this is happening more and more under the eugenics model, more and more here in the United States as we adopt Obamacare.
[00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:27.978]  As we move towards a planned economy where there's limited economic options and less and less freedom all the time.
[00:00:28.318 --> 00:00:31.800]  Now I just want to point out they really do consider us human resources.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.583]  I'm going to play you a clip from a 1974 family planning clip called Communicate, Speak, They Are Listening.
[00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:42.984]  Family planning is of course code for eugenics.
[00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:46.305]  It's the softer side of Sears, the softer side of eugenics.
[00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:47.706]  Let's go to that clip right now.
[00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:52.289]  In Kenya, the Minister of Finance and Development offers valuable support.
[00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:01.015]  Well, my views, which really are government views, is that family planning is an integral part of development planning.
[00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:13.543]  It is an essential part for the reason that you cannot hope to plan other forms of production if you cannot plan the production of the main resource, the human being.
[00:01:14.502 --> 00:01:16.904]  We view it as an aspect of human freedom.
[00:01:17.324 --> 00:01:33.617]  Incredibly, you see this finance and development minister claim that it's the state's role to decide how many people reproduce, who and when, because they are human resources, part of the overall planned economy system, which time and again leads to limited freedom and basically totally slavery.
[00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:41.144]  But on top of that, you see this incredible 1984 Orwellian backwards doublespeak where freedom is slavery.
[00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:43.926]  Somehow when the state tells you if you can breed or not,
[00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:49.308]  That's freedom from the natural restrictions on breeding that otherwise occur.
[00:01:49.648 --> 00:01:52.409]  So that he's not slave to just natural forces.
[00:01:53.049 --> 00:02:02.092]  And this is what I said in Swahili to these people, that we view family planning education as an extension of personal liberty.
[00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:05.133]  And you can find that film in the National Archives.
