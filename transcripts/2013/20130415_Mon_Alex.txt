[00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:06.383]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:08.164]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:09.905]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:11.506]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:13.047]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:17.250]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.352]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:36.357]  Well, all Hades is breaking loose in world markets, including gold.
[00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:47.860]  The globalists are on record saying that they've been artificially suppressing the price of precious metals because it competes with their fiat currencies, which they're devaluing.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.782]  But in the laws of finance and the laws of economics, gold and silver and other commodities will only go up over time.
[00:00:56.638 --> 00:01:13.837]  The insiders of course control the major stock markets and can go up and down and ride the rallies up and then of course trigger the declines downward and that's all part of the record from LIBOR and the fixing of interest rates to the plunge protection team.
[00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:20.381]  But I have expected that they could massively drive down gold.
[00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:23.943]  But if you look at a 12-13 year graph, it will only go back up later.
[00:01:23.943 --> 00:01:27.024]  That's why I'm not going to sell any of the gold or silver I have.
[00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:38.590]  And again, I don't have the gold and silver I have as an investment, as something to try to make a bunch of money, even though most of the gold I bought was when it was below $500, silver when it was below $10.
[00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:47.052]  I've taken the capital, extra capital that's been brought in really since and put it into the news operations.
[00:01:47.052 --> 00:01:54.359]  But I do have an emergency backup nest egg, a little bit of cash, a little bit of gold and silver, a little bit of property.
[00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.463]  But personally, if they drove gold down to $1,000 an ounce,
[00:01:59.898 --> 00:02:02.960]  Or if they drove gold down to $600 an ounce, I'm not going to sell it.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.283]  Because that just shows what a totally manipulated society we're in, where they use naked shorting to do this.
[00:02:09.283 --> 00:02:18.789]  And we're going to get Gerald Cilente and Max Keiser to pop in today or tomorrow with their take on what's happening with this, and we will continue to track it.
[00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:26.053]  If you go up to DrudgeReport.com, we can punch this up on screen for people who are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, they've got a
[00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.392]  Live feed of what's going on there.
[00:02:30.392 --> 00:02:34.916]  The Bloomberg Gold is down 6.91%.
[00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.251]  6.91% to $1,380 an ounce.
[00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:44.912]  They're calling this a collapse.
[00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:51.534]  A collapse would be losing half its value is generally what you call a collapse, not 6.91.
[00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:53.695]  But they're trying to create a collapse.
[00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:54.595]  Here's the headlines.
[00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:57.036]  Gold set for worst two-day loss since 1983.
[00:03:00.202 --> 00:03:04.445]  I've got other headlines here where they're calling it a collapse.
[00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:06.927]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on.
[00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:08.869]  Investors bail amid collapse.
[00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:09.789]  There's the headline.
[00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.330]  Panic is everywhere.
[00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.932]  Worst two-day loss since 1983.
[00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:16.795]  So that's how the media is pushing it, ABC News.
[00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:21.138]  Gold investors exit amid price collapse.
[00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:24.000]  Meanwhile, you'll see Soros badmouth gold.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.961]  You'll see other globalists do it.
[00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.783]  They just want to be able to drive it down to buy it.
[00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:35.313]  And they're forcing Cyprus to sell off its gold because Cyprus was signed on to prop up European bonds.
[00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:43.986]  And the EU is in the news today saying, we're doing great, everything is going according to plan, Europe's great!
[00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:47.709]  And they mean the globalists that are capturing Europe, destroying its middle class.
[00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.213]  You see, Europe must be impoverished, the United States must be impoverished, Canada must be impoverished.
[00:03:54.213 --> 00:03:59.817]  The Western world, from New Zealand to Canada, from the United States to Deutschland,
[00:04:00.618 --> 00:04:05.221]  From France to even Turkey's part of the West, really.
[00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:07.142]  They must all be impoverished.
[00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:11.505]  Eastern Europe, you name it, must be totally impoverished.
[00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:13.786]  That's the globalist philosophy.
[00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:17.209]  The globalists want America out of the way.
[00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.170]  Fighting with each other along racial and religious lines.
[00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.094]  Balkanized with a robber baron elite above the law who pay no taxes.
[00:04:26.094 --> 00:04:28.516]  And their minions pay less than a blue collar worker.
[00:04:29.557 --> 00:04:31.978]  Obama pays 18.4% taxes.
[00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:33.779]  That was in the Wall Street Journal yesterday.
[00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.081]  And by the way, it's the day you pay your money to the private Federal Reserve.
[00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:39.142]  Didn't have a Federal Reserve until 1913.
[00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:41.704]  Didn't have an income tax.
[00:04:41.704 --> 00:04:44.105]  How do we build America without it?
[00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:47.707]  They use the income tax as like tying the boat to the dock.
[00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:52.630]  So no matter how fast you rev the engine and the propeller, you never leave the dock.
[00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.470]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.232]  Plus the massive attacks on the Second Amendment and more.
[00:04:57.232 --> 00:04:57.853]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.882 --> 00:05:01.962]  I had tried everything.
[00:05:01.962 --> 00:05:04.303]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:07.444]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:05:07.444 --> 00:05:12.265]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:05:12.265 --> 00:05:19.127]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:05:19.127 --> 00:05:29.570]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.811]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:41.073]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:42.633]  Now that's results.
[00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:49.415]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:55.137]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:06:48.894 --> 00:06:51.256]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:08.996]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:12.678]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:17.141]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:22.185]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[00:07:22.185 --> 00:07:29.690]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus,
[00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.830]  I think so.
[00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:30.925]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 15th day
[00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:36.812]  of April 2013.
[00:08:36.812 --> 00:08:44.438]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours today.
[00:08:47.418 --> 00:09:04.282]  And we're going to have pop in at the bottom of the next hour, Richard Belzer's got a new book out on the Kennedy assassination hit list that has the most compelling evidence that it was an inside job with more people involved than Lee Harvey Oswald, obviously, because of the hundreds of people that were murdered to cover it up.
[00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:07.443]  The witnesses, you name it, and the 50th anniversary.
[00:09:08.463 --> 00:09:14.205]  Coming up, we're going to be talking about some of that today.
[00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:17.686]  Obviously, the globalists on record are manipulating interest rates.
[00:09:17.686 --> 00:09:19.686]  They're manipulating gold prices.
[00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:26.668]  They just use paper fiat to drive down the prices.
[00:09:26.668 --> 00:09:33.110]  There is a lot going on today that we are going to be breaking down.
[00:09:34.602 --> 00:09:36.904]  We've got developments on the North Korean front.
[00:09:36.904 --> 00:09:38.045]  North Korea brands U.S.
[00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:38.966]  an enemy of the state.
[00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:47.755]  Yeah, our government's demonized the founding fathers and they patriots, Christians, you name it, as enemies of the state, so why not?
[00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:50.217]  In fact, North Korea should love the U.S.
[00:09:50.217 --> 00:09:50.597]  government.
[00:09:50.597 --> 00:09:54.620]  I mean, it acts more and more just like they do.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.803]  And the North Korean government is saying they're ready to launch missiles.
[00:09:58.803 --> 00:10:07.550]  South Korean defense minister concurs that that is going on just all part of another terrorist government menacing
[00:10:09.404 --> 00:10:18.631]  uh... everyone so that they can get more oil, more food, more weapons.
[00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:19.732]  That's what our government does.
[00:10:19.732 --> 00:10:30.139]  It's like give us all your rights, give us all your liberties, let us spy on you without warrants, let us secretly arrest you, or Al-Qaeda will come and murder you and your family and blow you up.
[00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:34.663]  North Korea says give us money, give us oil, give us all this power, or
[00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:41.279]  We will launch nuclear missiles at you.
[00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:43.141]  And why produce anything?
[00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:48.186]  Why not just take over society and menace everyone when you're the only ones that have the guns?
[00:10:49.144 --> 00:10:58.006]  But before this dream of the total state can take place, they need to first disarm the American people.
[00:10:58.006 --> 00:11:13.029]  It doesn't look good in the New World Order for the main engine of the empire, the military engine and propaganda engine of the transhumanist, eugenicist, death cult-based, control freak religion of world government, if the United States
[00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:33.115]  If we can still have families living in homes together, if the United States still has a high standard of living, if the United States is still armed, the power structure cannot and will not put up with that.
[00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:38.019]  And that's why there is the move to disarm the American people.
[00:11:39.497 --> 00:11:44.104]  I mean, it's very simple, and they're putting their full court press in just everywhere.
[00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:53.239]  Every one of their operatives, from Bob Costas to Bill Maher, are there saying, just get rid of the Second Amendment.
[00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:55.269]  Get rid of it completely.
[00:11:55.269 --> 00:12:04.235]  In fact, this was Bill Maher, Friday night, on his HBO program, expletive-laden, just saying, hey, let's just get rid of the citizens' right.
[00:12:04.235 --> 00:12:05.355]  You never had a right.
[00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:09.578]  He goes on to say, the full video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:09.578 --> 00:12:12.060]  The Second Amendment is BS, he says.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.760]  Let's play that clip.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.202]  I'm sorry, but this is the problem with the gun debate.
[00:12:15.342 --> 00:12:18.104]  is that it's a constant center-right debate.
[00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:19.825]  There's no left in this debate.
[00:12:19.825 --> 00:12:25.728]  Everyone on the left is so afraid to say what should be said, which is the Second Amendment is bull****.
[00:12:25.728 --> 00:12:29.030]  Why doesn't anyone go at the core of it?
[00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.870]  And then they go on.
[00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.872]  You can watch the full video to say there is no individual right.
[00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:40.277]  Well, then how can the government have guns if the government is by the consent of the governed?
[00:12:40.277 --> 00:12:42.498]  I mean, our country fought a war
[00:12:46.334 --> 00:12:50.959]  Our country began out of the attempt to take the guns.
[00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:55.685]  And the examples of this just go on and on and on.
[00:12:55.685 --> 00:12:59.269]  And it makes me sick to know we're going into bondage.
[00:12:59.269 --> 00:13:01.552]  You notice they're taking all the other rights and liberties right now.
[00:13:02.383 --> 00:13:05.724]  You notice right now, they're trying to say we don't have any rights.
[00:13:05.724 --> 00:13:07.044]  We don't have any, quote, privileges.
[00:13:07.044 --> 00:13:11.545]  Well, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence are not a list of privileges.
[00:13:11.545 --> 00:13:15.326]  They're a list of rights that exist of all free human beings.
[00:13:15.326 --> 00:13:21.407]  You don't need to hear a law that says it's wrong to grab somebody's child out of a backyard and molest them.
[00:13:21.407 --> 00:13:25.768]  Because you have a conscience, and you're not inherently an evil person.
[00:13:25.768 --> 00:13:27.708]  You don't want to do that.
[00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:30.849]  In fact, if you hear about it in the news, you're horrified by it.
[00:13:32.528 --> 00:13:40.655]  A couple's been charged with, you know, the baby was crying so they reportedly smothered it with a pillow.
[00:13:40.655 --> 00:13:46.000]  You don't need to be told that's horrible to know that it's wrong.
[00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:49.456]  You don't need to be told abortion's wrong.
[00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:50.616]  You know inherently.
[00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:59.302]  Especially when it's nine months old, and the baby slips out, so they chop it up there on the table while it begs for its life, and literally fights the scalpel.
[00:13:59.302 --> 00:14:09.309]  That's coming out in these different court hearings about abortionists, where they're just filthy facilities, where they make jokes with the dead babies, you know, selling the body parts.
[00:14:09.309 --> 00:14:11.510]  A lot of them do weird rituals.
[00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.252]  Of course, who do you think wants to be an abortionist?
[00:14:14.252 --> 00:14:16.734]  A large portion of them are into black magic.
[00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:19.296]  It just keeps coming out.
[00:14:19.296 --> 00:14:22.619]  Of course they're into black magic, people that do partial birth abortions.
[00:14:22.619 --> 00:14:37.072]  I mean, you can have somebody who thinks it's really a right, no it's not really a human, and you know, they do first trimester abortions, and you could have some argument there, in their minds at least, I don't agree with it, that hey, you know, this isn't really a human yet.
[00:14:37.072 --> 00:14:40.675]  But see, now it's hey, let's kill people up to three years of age.
[00:14:40.675 --> 00:14:41.676]  Hey, let's go ahead and
[00:14:42.907 --> 00:14:44.208]  Shoot grandma in the head.
[00:14:44.208 --> 00:14:45.408]  Let's go ahead and... No, no.
[00:14:45.408 --> 00:14:46.069]  That'd be too nice.
[00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:49.570]  Let's dehydrate grandma.
[00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:53.092]  Let's dehydrate grandma.
[00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:57.874]  That's the best way to get rid of her.
[00:14:57.874 --> 00:14:59.355]  And that just goes on everywhere.
[00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:07.399]  So the point is, when we stop caring about each other, when we stop caring about checks and balances and liberties, there's no foundation.
[00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:08.179]  There's no floor.
[00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:16.714]  Everything falls to the absolute core of tyranny.
[00:15:16.714 --> 00:15:22.056]  So the worse of the worst then set the standard.
[00:15:22.056 --> 00:15:37.643]  And that's what the establishment historically has known, at least in the West in the last 400 years, and realized that more liberty, more checks and balances means more chances for them to have a future and not have a new government come to power that actually robs them.
[00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:56.180]  These tyrannies are very dangerous for the establishment itself, but they're such an anti-family, such an evil possessed lust for death and destruction and to really tear down the foundations of manhood and womanhood and childhood.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.662]  They're such an evil animating this.
[00:15:59.662 --> 00:16:05.205]  This is not some government, true believer, socialist utopia they're building.
[00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:07.587]  They're building a hellish world.
[00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:12.663]  And you can look at the fruits of collectivism.
[00:16:12.663 --> 00:16:14.845]  And fascism is a collectivist system.
[00:16:14.845 --> 00:16:17.907]  Socialism that leads to communism is.
[00:16:17.907 --> 00:16:20.849]  They try to dress them up like fake choices in the colleges.
[00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:22.430]  That's not the real political paradigm.
[00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:31.056]  Before 150 years ago, it was taught that the left and right were male-female.
[00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:36.358]  Sinister was the left, associated with Eve, the devil.
[00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:37.278]  Okay?
[00:16:37.278 --> 00:16:39.119]  That's the only left and right that there is.
[00:16:39.119 --> 00:16:58.706]  And so the Illuminati in France began to promote 200 years ago, roughly, about 215 years ago, this is all mainline history books, the left-right paradigm for politics out of their ancient religion.
[00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:02.909]  Which is just magic, or the occult, the hidden.
[00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:08.035]  Before that, the debate was less liberty or more liberty.
[00:17:08.035 --> 00:17:10.057]  More freedom or less freedom.
[00:17:10.057 --> 00:17:13.481]  Is this a tyrant or is this not a tyrant?
[00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:14.563]  Is it just?
[00:17:14.563 --> 00:17:16.785]  Is there justice?
[00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:18.147]  Justice for all.
[00:17:21.906 --> 00:17:28.069]  Because you had a sense of justice because you were an upright, moral, noble person.
[00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:35.914]  Nobility didn't just mean that you came from a royal family or a top family.
[00:17:35.914 --> 00:17:39.696]  It meant that you were noble in your bearing, that you led your troops.
[00:17:39.696 --> 00:17:44.679]  If you're going to launch a war as a king, you better be in the very front line with everybody trying to kill you.
[00:17:45.259 --> 00:17:52.537]  George Washington, at the head of his troops, his clothing shot up on a routine basis, protected by Providence.
[00:17:52.537 --> 00:17:53.960]  That is nobility.
[00:17:55.815 --> 00:18:12.820]  Nobility is being able to turn the other cheek when someone is weak and pathetic and in a bad position to teach them a lesson, but also knowing when to shut somebody down and crush them when they're a snake and consciously evil.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.101]  Christ was the ultimate example of nobility.
[00:18:16.294 --> 00:18:26.821]  Turn the other cheek to the brethren but whip the money changers because they were consciously turned over to evil and fraud and defrauding the entire system and had taken over the house of the Lord.
[00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:29.242]  Had taken over God's house.
[00:18:29.242 --> 00:18:30.243]  Had defiled it.
[00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:33.885]  Had set themselves up before God as the idol.
[00:18:33.885 --> 00:18:37.147]  How many churches have done that?
[00:18:37.147 --> 00:18:41.230]  How many churches have turned the state and the worship of the state and the worship of
[00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.733]  Immature, degenerate, arbitrary power.
[00:18:46.733 --> 00:18:47.633]  Let's go to another clip.
[00:18:47.633 --> 00:18:49.275]  Again, here's Dianne Feinstein.
[00:18:49.275 --> 00:18:53.337]  If she can get the votes, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn in all your semi-autos.
[00:18:53.337 --> 00:18:54.158]  Here it is.
[00:18:54.158 --> 00:19:07.988]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:19:09.608 --> 00:19:10.509]  She would have done it.
[00:19:10.509 --> 00:19:14.412]  So Bill Maher says, hey, you have no Second Amendment, you have no right.
[00:19:14.412 --> 00:19:18.575]  Bob Costas gets all excited and starts clapping and agreeing.
[00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.977]  And these guys are crazed on these shows.
[00:19:20.977 --> 00:19:24.941]  They know they're willing accomplices for an authoritarian takeover.
[00:19:25.629 --> 00:19:32.573]  They've been told that they're going to be absolutely taken care of while they sit there in their big armored communities with armed bodyguards.
[00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:34.834]  They'll be able to keep their guns.
[00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:45.340]  And that they've been told, go along with this, you'll be taken care of while the globalists consciously implode the economy to make us poor as a political tool of control.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.001]  Now there's new gun news.
[00:19:48.123 --> 00:19:52.246]  Coming up, and I talked about this Friday, I talked about it yesterday, it's so important.
[00:19:52.246 --> 00:19:58.651]  The video is up at DrugsReport.com on the left-hand side next to the California flag.
[00:20:00.802 --> 00:20:04.664]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[00:20:04.664 --> 00:20:05.685]  That bears repeating.
[00:20:05.685 --> 00:20:09.587]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[00:20:09.587 --> 00:20:14.129]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:19.612]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day.
[00:20:19.992 --> 00:20:22.453]  Pro-EM1 is dairy, wheat, and soy free.
[00:20:22.453 --> 00:20:24.954]  Contains all natural and certified organic ingredients.
[00:20:24.954 --> 00:20:27.115]  Contains no preservatives or animal products.
[00:20:27.115 --> 00:20:29.196]  Supports a healthy digestive and immune system.
[00:20:29.196 --> 00:20:30.216]  Supports weight loss.
[00:20:30.216 --> 00:20:32.017]  Improves absorption of food nutrients.
[00:20:32.017 --> 00:20:33.678]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.
[00:20:33.678 --> 00:20:35.258]  Is never freeze-dried.
[00:20:35.258 --> 00:20:39.120]  And uses three groups of live, viable, beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.241]  Order Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse at Terragonics.com.
[00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:47.162]  Spelled T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:48.683]  Terragonics dot com.
[00:20:48.683 --> 00:20:49.523]  Or call toll free 866-369-3678.
[00:20:49.523 --> 00:20:49.903]  That's 866-369-3678.
[00:20:49.903 --> 00:20:51.064]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[00:21:04.454 --> 00:21:06.877]  Curious about what comes next?
[00:21:06.877 --> 00:21:13.565]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars.
[00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:16.949]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[00:21:16.949 --> 00:21:23.176]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:27.498]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[00:21:27.498 --> 00:21:32.821]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[00:21:32.821 --> 00:21:39.285]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[00:21:39.285 --> 00:21:44.088]  The new, brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.
[00:21:44.088 --> 00:21:46.709]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:21:49.611 --> 00:21:50.492]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to Faketv.com.
[00:21:50.492 --> 00:21:51.652]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[00:21:59.878 --> 00:22:01.819]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:03.981]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:22:03.981 --> 00:22:09.665]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:22:09.665 --> 00:22:13.688]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:22:13.688 --> 00:22:17.571]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:22:17.571 --> 00:22:18.952]  The fact is, you are.
[00:22:18.952 --> 00:22:19.973]  We all are.
[00:22:19.973 --> 00:22:22.295]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:22:22.595 --> 00:22:31.081]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[00:22:31.081 --> 00:22:32.482]  Be prepared before you need it.
[00:22:32.482 --> 00:22:35.925]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[00:22:35.925 --> 00:22:38.286]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[00:22:38.286 --> 00:22:42.830]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:48.694]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:50.596]  And check out their spring specials.
[00:22:50.596 --> 00:22:57.064]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:22:57.064 --> 00:22:58.926]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:01.192]  Whew!
[00:23:01.192 --> 00:23:02.092]  Nice shootin'!
[00:23:02.092 --> 00:23:04.773]  Hey, that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig.
[00:23:04.773 --> 00:23:05.853]  Is that multicam?
[00:23:05.853 --> 00:23:06.253]  Yep!
[00:23:06.253 --> 00:23:08.554]  Got it from StrikeHardGear.com.
[00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:09.894]  Strike what?
[00:23:09.894 --> 00:23:13.195]  StrikeHardGear.com.
[00:23:13.195 --> 00:23:16.016]  Set your sights on StrikeHardGear.com.
[00:23:16.016 --> 00:23:20.177]  Tough, tactical gear for your Soviet-style weapon that's made in the USA.
[00:23:20.177 --> 00:23:25.558]  Affordable, plus a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee and lifetime replacement warranty.
[00:23:25.558 --> 00:23:27.179]  StrikeHardGear.com.
[00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:28.859]  Go ahead, pull the trigger.
[00:23:29.099 --> 00:23:38.425]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:38.425 --> 00:23:39.226]  This capitalism?
[00:23:39.226 --> 00:23:45.510]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.291]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:49.453]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:23:49.453 --> 00:23:50.393]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:50.393 --> 00:23:51.454]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:51.454 --> 00:23:51.794]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.794 --> 00:23:52.114]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:05.723 --> 00:24:11.047]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:24:11.047 --> 00:24:16.871]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:24:16.871 --> 00:24:20.893]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:25.356]  I've analyzed the feeling I have.
[00:24:25.356 --> 00:24:27.618]  The overdriving feeling is sorrow.
[00:24:31.257 --> 00:24:40.361]  That America and the world is so decadent, so fallen, so childlike, so insecure, so immature.
[00:24:40.361 --> 00:24:51.366]  People watch, and I watch their interactions at a movie, or at the park, or at the shopping mall, or paying bills, and I sit there
[00:24:52.919 --> 00:25:05.384]  And I see the general public just absolutely dumbed down and immature, and they have no idea what they're facing.
[00:25:05.384 --> 00:25:11.787]  And then those of us that are aware and awake and involved, we're the group being demonized.
[00:25:11.787 --> 00:25:13.848]  I mean, look at who Homeland Security demonizes.
[00:25:14.642 --> 00:25:16.686]  People that talk about a New World Order.
[00:25:16.686 --> 00:25:21.434]  People that talk about a New World Order global governance program.
[00:25:21.434 --> 00:25:23.117]  Returning veterans.
[00:25:23.117 --> 00:25:24.719]  Mainline Christians now.
[00:25:25.942 --> 00:25:28.863]  Next to the Ku Klux Klan and Al Qaeda.
[00:25:28.863 --> 00:25:30.963]  The Army's being taught it.
[00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:33.284]  I talked about this yesterday and showed the news articles.
[00:25:33.284 --> 00:25:40.566]  I'm going to do a special report this week where even the state police of Colorado have gone public going and sheriffs have gone public going.
[00:25:40.566 --> 00:25:46.867]  The new federal training asks if we're ready to confiscate guns from Christians.
[00:25:46.867 --> 00:25:49.868]  I mean, they're training for war with us!
[00:25:49.868 --> 00:25:52.408]  I mean, it's happening!
[00:25:52.408 --> 00:25:54.529]  And it's all over the top
[00:25:56.423 --> 00:25:59.745]  And now I don't even have the instinct to believe the United States.
[00:25:59.745 --> 00:26:01.766]  I mean, I realize it's a worldwide tyranny.
[00:26:01.766 --> 00:26:04.348]  A lot of people hear this and get scared and decide to just say nothing.
[00:26:04.348 --> 00:26:06.709]  Maybe they'll pass you over.
[00:26:06.709 --> 00:26:14.674]  The angel of death is not going to pass over your house, ladies and gentlemen, until you publicly say where you stand and publicly say you stand against the enemy.
[00:26:15.976 --> 00:26:20.737]  Going along with this is not going to have the evil pass over you.
[00:26:20.737 --> 00:26:23.118]  It's going to have it come to your doorstep.
[00:26:23.118 --> 00:26:26.799]  And I just cannot impress upon you... I'll tell you what else makes me sick.
[00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:34.161]  All the infighting by so-called libertarian and conservative talk show hosts who then attack people and then people even respond back.
[00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:34.661]  You know what?
[00:26:34.661 --> 00:26:36.562]  I'm even wrong to have responded back.
[00:26:36.562 --> 00:26:39.802]  And I say this and then he does new stuff and I get mad at him.
[00:26:39.802 --> 00:26:41.283]  But things are too serious.
[00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:44.417]  And I usually can do what I say I'm going to do.
[00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:48.620]  Like I've said before, I'm not going to respond back to Glenn Beck.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:27:00.610]  I may respond if he does stuff again, but I'm going to be gentlemanly about it, and I am putting out olive branches to all my so-called enemies, even though a lot of them I know are evil people who wouldn't take an olive branch.
[00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.393]  I'm still spiritually forgiving everyone.
[00:27:04.013 --> 00:27:06.435]  Because a lot of people get jealous when you're in this position.
[00:27:06.435 --> 00:27:07.997]  A lot of people act weird.
[00:27:07.997 --> 00:27:11.560]  You can always one-up yourself by putting down somebody.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.821]  It's all Cass Sunstein.
[00:27:12.821 --> 00:27:13.962]  Cognitive infiltration.
[00:27:13.962 --> 00:27:17.585]  The White House said four years ago they would infiltrate alternative media.
[00:27:17.585 --> 00:27:19.567]  Try to get us to end fight with each other.
[00:27:19.567 --> 00:27:22.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, we need to unify together.
[00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.652]  Defending the Second Amendment.
[00:27:24.652 --> 00:27:27.234]  Defending the sanctity of life.
[00:27:27.234 --> 00:27:30.137]  By the way, we're on the march reversing abortion.
[00:27:31.089 --> 00:27:37.632]  Because polls show, the large index of polls, people swung against abortion.
[00:27:37.632 --> 00:27:40.112]  The people have swung against GMO.
[00:27:40.112 --> 00:27:45.234]  They have swung against, so it's not about left right now, it's about right and wrong.
[00:27:45.234 --> 00:27:47.815]  People are swinging pro-gun.
[00:27:47.815 --> 00:27:48.976]  All the numbers show.
[00:27:48.976 --> 00:27:56.859]  That's why the collectivists who are in control, gutting our economy, gutting our future, signing us on to trillions of dollars of debt that aren't ours,
[00:27:58.763 --> 00:28:05.908]  Selling our infrastructure out for nothing to China, giving them all our deep-water ports in this hemisphere, as part of a globalist deal.
[00:28:05.908 --> 00:28:17.757]  Just like Hitler and Stalin divided Poland, America has been divided between the EU mega-banks, the British banks, the Federal Reserve banks that are globalist-owned, foreign, and China.
[00:28:17.757 --> 00:28:18.618]  It's already happened.
[00:28:18.618 --> 00:28:20.700]  The deal was already made.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.941]  That's why they gave them Panama Canal in 2000.
[00:28:24.642 --> 00:28:29.584]  That's why they've given them all the deep water ports on the West Coast, from Seattle to Long Beach.
[00:28:29.584 --> 00:28:37.467]  Man, when you study history, I don't just say I get chills, folks.
[00:28:37.467 --> 00:28:39.968]  I can hardly do this radio show.
[00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:44.670]  Because even doing this radio show is just like everything's business as usual.
[00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:51.492]  It's not business as usual.
[00:28:51.492 --> 00:28:53.413]  I just am so worried about my children.
[00:28:54.164 --> 00:29:00.047]  I watched my five-year-old daughter go off to dance class this morning with my mother, who took her.
[00:29:00.047 --> 00:29:08.812]  My mother's innocent, even though she's a very smart person who knows history, is a history-obsessed buff.
[00:29:08.812 --> 00:29:11.293]  What is my mother supposed to do to fight the New World Order?
[00:29:11.293 --> 00:29:13.875]  What's my five-year-old daughter supposed to do?
[00:29:13.875 --> 00:29:14.815]  I'm the man.
[00:29:14.815 --> 00:29:19.238]  I'm supposed to do something about this, and I don't know what to do!
[00:29:20.356 --> 00:29:23.758]  Because you got crazy criminals running wild.
[00:29:23.758 --> 00:29:33.842]  You can go out in Austin, Texas, or San Diego, California, and every person you talk to in trendy areas says, put all gun owners in forced labor camps.
[00:29:33.842 --> 00:29:34.863]  Ban water.
[00:29:34.863 --> 00:29:44.808]  I mean, they're just a sick cult of sick freaks who are not connected to history or reality and have no idea what they're going to do to everybody.
[00:29:44.808 --> 00:29:45.168]  OK?
[00:29:45.168 --> 00:29:48.169]  I mean, oh, man.
[00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.690]  We'll be back.
[00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:49.090]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.827 --> 00:29:52.829]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.829 --> 00:29:56.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.572 --> 00:30:10.676]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[00:30:41.275 --> 00:30:43.257]  This is an amazing deal.
[00:30:43.257 --> 00:30:48.481]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[00:30:48.481 --> 00:30:51.643]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call
[00:31:00.787 --> 00:31:04.189]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:31:04.189 --> 00:31:10.252]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:31:10.252 --> 00:31:14.134]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:31:14.134 --> 00:31:15.715]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[00:31:57.456 --> 00:31:59.597]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com
[00:32:00.257 --> 00:32:02.058]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:32:02.058 --> 00:32:04.379]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:32:04.379 --> 00:32:10.663]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:32:10.663 --> 00:32:14.125]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:18.067]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:32:18.067 --> 00:32:19.448]  The fact is, you are.
[00:32:19.448 --> 00:32:20.469]  We all are.
[00:32:20.469 --> 00:32:22.810]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:31.677]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:31.677 --> 00:32:33.058]  Be prepared before you need it.
[00:32:33.058 --> 00:32:36.541]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[00:32:36.541 --> 00:32:38.923]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:43.486]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:43.486 --> 00:32:49.371]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:49.631 --> 00:32:51.272]  And check out their spring specials.
[00:32:51.272 --> 00:32:53.174]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633.
[00:32:53.174 --> 00:32:57.797]  Or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:57.797 --> 00:33:04.181]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[00:33:04.181 --> 00:33:06.043]  We are on the march.
[00:33:06.043 --> 00:33:09.205]  The empire is on the run.
[00:33:09.205 --> 00:33:16.210]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.371]  We are on the march.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.562]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:21.562 --> 00:33:28.806]  But that's why their counter-offensive is in high gear.
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:45.615]  And again, top globalists from Rothkopf to Kissinger to Zbigniew Brzezinski, all of them have put out different white papers discussing the fact, on record, you can just
[00:33:46.867 --> 00:33:49.790]  Go to YouTube and type in Brzezinski says a leader in trouble.
[00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:52.612]  Brzezinski says the whole world is waking up.
[00:33:52.612 --> 00:33:54.975]  It's all there on record.
[00:33:54.975 --> 00:33:59.238]  But still, they're in control of our currencies worldwide.
[00:33:59.238 --> 00:34:02.041]  They're mopping up the few countries they don't control.
[00:34:02.041 --> 00:34:12.811]  And they are butchering the value of the people's pensions, the people's investments, the infrastructure.
[00:34:13.797 --> 00:34:18.738]  Because it's not enough to control the fiat issuance of currency and credit.
[00:34:18.738 --> 00:34:21.879]  The technocrats want to make you poor to control you.
[00:34:21.879 --> 00:34:24.580]  And that's really their greatest crime.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:31.441]  And then they argue, well, people having plenty of food, water, and entertainment, and shelter, that makes them decadent.
[00:34:31.441 --> 00:34:33.342]  And so we're going to take that away.
[00:34:33.342 --> 00:34:34.982]  Austerity is beautiful.
[00:34:34.982 --> 00:34:37.663]  And of course there's a grain of truth there.
[00:34:37.663 --> 00:34:40.964]  That prosperity makes monsters.
[00:34:40.964 --> 00:34:41.884]  Adversity makes men.
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:46.039]  I flipped what Victor Hugo said, or out of order.
[00:34:46.039 --> 00:34:49.588]  He said, uh, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[00:34:50.928 --> 00:34:56.249]  But the globalists have geared the educational system to dumb people down on record.
[00:34:56.249 --> 00:34:58.110]  That's declassified.
[00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.310]  Covered in the book, Deliberate Dumbing Down, with the internal documents.
[00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.931]  Charlotte is the Rehead of Policy, Department of Education.
[00:35:03.931 --> 00:35:09.552]  It's on record they want to dumb down self-centered, really evil population.
[00:35:09.552 --> 00:35:14.633]  I mean, I don't really pay attention to pop culture, but I've been forced to.
[00:35:14.633 --> 00:35:17.514]  And the stuff targeting tweenie and preteen girls,
[00:35:18.778 --> 00:35:29.328]  8, 9, 10, 11-year-olds that I hear booming out of cars and that I see children listening to on their iPads and iPods.
[00:35:29.328 --> 00:35:38.177]  All of it is sexualizing them and hardcore devil worship.
[00:35:38.177 --> 00:35:43.381]  And I'm not just talking about Lady Gaga, but Kesha, Jay-Z, all of it.
[00:35:45.251 --> 00:36:04.004]  Again, the guys were showing me this weekend some of the Kesha videos where they're teaching young girls how to commit suicide and how beautiful it is to be married to the devil and how great it is to kill yourself and we wonder why kids are killing themselves and little girls are epidemic cutting themselves and it shows that.
[00:36:04.004 --> 00:36:05.825]  In fact, I don't even want to look at it.
[00:36:05.825 --> 00:36:07.326]  Take it down off the screen.
[00:36:07.326 --> 00:36:10.408]  And of course, I can't imagine how cursed Kesha will be.
[00:36:11.608 --> 00:36:12.509]  Not by God.
[00:36:12.509 --> 00:36:16.131]  I mean, when you get into evil, it will destroy you.
[00:36:16.131 --> 00:36:19.533]  I shiver just watching this.
[00:36:19.533 --> 00:36:30.220]  Folks, when societies do this, there's always giant wars, everything collapses, and large portions of the population are killed.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.021]  I mean, this is like clockwork.
[00:36:32.021 --> 00:36:35.724]  This is like the oven dinging when it's gotten up to temperature.
[00:36:41.345 --> 00:36:47.349]  This is... I know I'm just ranting and preaching here.
[00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:50.071]  I've got so much news to get to.
[00:36:50.071 --> 00:37:05.902]  When we can go out on the streets of Austin, and every person we talk to, every person, we say, hey, let's ban dihydrogen monoxide to save the earth, and they just mindlessly sign it when that's H2O.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.789]  And then people on InfoWars.com, the so-called liberals, the authoritarian brainwashed government cult people.
[00:37:19.994 --> 00:37:21.214]  The state cult.
[00:37:21.214 --> 00:37:26.796]  They're in there arguing that hydrogen monoxide is not water with straight faces, and they're doing it on YouTube.
[00:37:26.796 --> 00:37:33.378]  Because see, in the new world, you don't argue with our facts, you just make your own facts.
[00:37:33.378 --> 00:37:40.000]  Like O'Brien tells Winston when he's torturing him in 1984, he goes, Winston, two plus two equals four?
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.001]  You say that's proof of freedom?
[00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:45.722]  I'm going to torture you until you'll believe it's whatever I say it is.
[00:37:46.562 --> 00:37:55.766]  Don't you know we could suspend gravity with our mathematicians, but also still have gravity for our ships and aircraft to navigate?
[00:37:55.766 --> 00:38:05.129]  And have our captains and pilots believe that there's no gravity while they use gravity in their computations?
[00:38:05.129 --> 00:38:06.170]  And that's exactly it.
[00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:14.293]  They are now arguing that hydrogen monoxide is not water, instead of admitting that all these university trendies and
[00:38:15.984 --> 00:38:26.597]  You know, physics graduates and chemist graduates don't know what dihydrogen monoxide is.
[00:38:26.597 --> 00:38:29.240]  I mean, we've reached that level now where you can go.
[00:38:31.766 --> 00:38:33.007]  Because I've talked to Mark Dice.
[00:38:33.007 --> 00:38:36.650]  I mean, he went out and talked to people and that's what he ran into.
[00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:44.096]  The video's up on DrugsReport.com on the left hand side underneath the California flag of the bear in distress.
[00:38:44.096 --> 00:38:50.542]  And you watch it and every person, except for two young women who were obviously sisters, they say, I don't want to turn my guns in.
[00:38:50.542 --> 00:38:52.103]  I own guns.
[00:38:52.103 --> 00:38:54.905]  Everyone else, he said, you know, we're going to
[00:38:55.998 --> 00:38:57.439]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[00:38:57.439 --> 00:39:03.020]  We're going to go and arrest the evil white Tea Party people and take their guns.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:08.762]  And by the way, I'm going to send my reporters out to go one step further and say, you know what?
[00:39:08.762 --> 00:39:10.943]  These people haven't paid their fair share.
[00:39:10.943 --> 00:39:14.745]  Let's have 100% taxes on them and put them in forced labor camps.
[00:39:14.745 --> 00:39:21.127]  And I guarantee you, I will find people at the University of Texas ready to put you in a forced labor camp.
[00:39:21.747 --> 00:39:29.595]  Because to them, they go watch zombie movies and death all day because it thrills them because they've never been in even a fist fight or a car wreck.
[00:39:29.595 --> 00:39:34.260]  Or they've never sat there and watched somebody in a car wreck with their throat slit and blood spraying all over them.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.581]  They've never been in the real thing.
[00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:37.604]  They all live completely sheltered lives.
[00:39:37.604 --> 00:39:40.767]  And it just sounds powerful to put us in a forced labor camp.
[00:39:43.663 --> 00:40:00.698]  You understand, these are sick freaks who would have gotten on their knees to any of history's tyrants and done whatever they said, because deep down they're so cowardly, deep down they're so scared, deep down they are so freaked out by evil that they run to it begging.
[00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:06.403]  See, the ultimate coward is delusional, and they decide to embrace this garbage.
[00:40:07.657 --> 00:40:12.818]  Let's go ahead and play an excerpt of the video that Unprecedented, Drudge, knows it's so important.
[00:40:12.818 --> 00:40:14.198]  We appreciate that.
[00:40:14.198 --> 00:40:15.719]  That's why I went with it.
[00:40:15.719 --> 00:40:18.999]  Even though Mark Dice has been a critic of me, I don't even care.
[00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:20.420]  This video needs to be seen.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.200]  See, I'm totally becoming free now.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.721]  I just don't even care.
[00:40:24.721 --> 00:40:25.961]  I don't care if they arrest me.
[00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:27.601]  I don't care if I get killed.
[00:40:27.601 --> 00:40:31.122]  I don't care if people lie about me, twist things.
[00:40:31.122 --> 00:40:32.582]  I don't care anymore.
[00:40:32.582 --> 00:40:34.943]  Because I understand the mega-massive evil
[00:40:36.244 --> 00:40:38.986]  Of the New World Order is what has to be dealt with.
[00:40:38.986 --> 00:40:40.406]  That's what I'm fighting.
[00:40:40.406 --> 00:40:42.127]  I'm fighting the abortion.
[00:40:42.127 --> 00:40:46.650]  I'm fighting the attempt to disarm us and enslave us and complete our journey to slavery.
[00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.911]  I'm fighting for our national sovereignty.
[00:40:48.911 --> 00:40:50.732]  I'm fighting for our borders.
[00:40:50.732 --> 00:40:52.554]  I'm fighting for our Republic.
[00:40:52.554 --> 00:40:54.515]  I'm fighting for our Constitution.
[00:40:54.515 --> 00:41:01.859]  And I'm fighting against the Federal Reserve shareholders that openly say that they're funding all the anti-gun, anti-family,
[00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:13.823]  Globalist organizations who are wanting 80% or higher tax rates on you and your family to transfer your money to them, not to just become rich, but to bankrupt you.
[00:41:13.823 --> 00:41:20.626]  I stand for prosperity, and I stand for liberty, and I stand for being honest and decent and telling the truth.
[00:41:20.626 --> 00:41:25.468]  And I call for everyone else who loves liberty to have your voice be heard today.
[00:41:25.468 --> 00:41:28.349]  And I said this yesterday on the Sunday Show, and I'm going to say it again.
[00:41:29.702 --> 00:41:56.790]  If you are a talk show host, or web person, or journalist, or preacher, or police officer, or counselor, or medical doctor, a person of influence, a Federal Reserve employee, my great uncle was pretty high up in the Dallas Federal Reserve and came to know it was all evil and bad before he died listening to me on the radio in Dallas, Uncle Billy,
[00:41:57.918 --> 00:41:58.539]  Great guy.
[00:41:58.539 --> 00:41:59.500]  Great World War II vet.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.922]  Just amazing person.
[00:42:00.922 --> 00:42:01.864]  My grandmother's brother.
[00:42:01.864 --> 00:42:04.207]  She's still alive.
[00:42:04.207 --> 00:42:09.154]  My whole issue is, ladies and gentlemen, for everybody out there,
[00:42:12.193 --> 00:42:20.000]  For everybody out there, what I'm asking you, what I'm begging you to do is to realize you've been taught going along is what gets you there.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:31.551]  No, no, it was going along that got us into this position and got us leveraged into debt that's not ours to make us bondage slaves, bond slaves.
[00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:33.653]  That's what a bond slave is, your bond.
[00:42:34.588 --> 00:42:37.030]  Because your family sold you.
[00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:43.356]  You could come from a free family in the Middle East, read the Bible, and your family could sell you as a bond slave.
[00:42:43.356 --> 00:42:48.781]  Just 200 years ago, before they began abolishing it, and they didn't abolish it in Germany until about 160 years ago.
[00:42:48.781 --> 00:42:50.763]  That's when they finally phased it out.
[00:42:50.763 --> 00:42:51.763]  Bond slave.
[00:42:51.763 --> 00:42:57.729]  Your parents could take you, even from a good family, and could sell you as an indentured slave.
[00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:14.638]  But you'll never be taught that in the media, because they want blacks to have an inferiority complex, and to be racist, and to hate all white people, to not even know that Germany didn't abolish all of its slavery until the 1880s.
[00:43:14.638 --> 00:43:17.940]  White slaves.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:21.902]  It wasn't even Germany yet, it got unified right around that time.
[00:43:22.898 --> 00:43:25.420]  Germania, Austrian-Hungarian Empire.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:30.084]  The point is, is that I want a future.
[00:43:30.084 --> 00:43:37.910]  And I'm sick of watching, man, I tell you, even though it's interesting, have you ever watched Big Fish hunt Little Fish, and you see them eating
[00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:38.410]  We're good to go.
[00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:08.155]  I feel, and it's because I'm not because I'm a hero or a good guy.
[00:44:08.155 --> 00:44:12.439]  It's a normal response of empathy.
[00:44:12.439 --> 00:44:17.143]  There it is, debtors prison legal in more than one-third of US states.
[00:44:17.143 --> 00:44:19.265]  And by the way, that's totally unconstitutional.
[00:44:20.484 --> 00:44:27.788]  Eddie Craig did a two and a half hour presentation that's at PrisonPlanet.tv on all of this.
[00:44:27.788 --> 00:44:29.670]  Bills of attainer, all of it.
[00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:33.592]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, America is not a free country anymore.
[00:44:33.592 --> 00:44:36.454]  There's islands of free media left, barely.
[00:44:36.454 --> 00:44:38.275]  The White House is openly going after them.
[00:44:39.881 --> 00:44:43.843]  And again, a lot of you are going to think, yeah, Alex, we actually know it's tyranny.
[00:44:43.843 --> 00:44:48.145]  We're going to shut up and we will run and we will live.
[00:44:48.145 --> 00:44:49.765]  Yes, for at least a while.
[00:44:49.765 --> 00:45:00.890]  But many years from now, lying in your beds, what would you do to just once come back here and tell our enemies, you can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom.
[00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:01.451]  And you know what?
[00:45:01.451 --> 00:45:04.452]  William Wallace lost.
[00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:06.593]  He won a few battles, but then was killed by Treasury.
[00:45:06.593 --> 00:45:07.733]  That's a historical fact.
[00:45:07.733 --> 00:45:08.193]  That's a real
[00:45:09.742 --> 00:45:11.582]  Real story, folks.
[00:45:11.582 --> 00:45:20.464]  But right after he was killed, Scotland got its independence.
[00:45:20.464 --> 00:45:22.965]  And so, and then of course it was another battle.
[00:45:22.965 --> 00:45:32.567]  The imperial system, the Viking system, the Norman system that had conquered England was able to conquer them again.
[00:45:32.567 --> 00:45:34.407]  But the whole point is it's an eternal struggle.
[00:45:35.925 --> 00:45:37.806]  And it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:45:37.806 --> 00:45:41.889]  Your children, let me explain this, are already having GMO fed to them.
[00:45:41.889 --> 00:45:46.291]  They're already pushing vaccines, trying to make them mandatory worldwide.
[00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:50.513]  By fraud, already making them mandatory, lying and saying it's mandatory.
[00:45:50.513 --> 00:45:57.197]  We're already in a criminal society because people keep saying yes, yes, yes, yes, yes to tyranny.
[00:45:57.197 --> 00:46:01.640]  And your children are walking dead, many of them already.
[00:46:03.274 --> 00:46:08.557]  They've done all this in rodent studies with guinea pigs, rats, mice, you name it.
[00:46:08.557 --> 00:46:09.157]  We've covered it.
[00:46:09.157 --> 00:46:11.258]  We sell books that cover it.
[00:46:11.258 --> 00:46:12.339]  We break it all down.
[00:46:12.339 --> 00:46:24.045]  In Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, in the Genetic Roulette books, we sell all of it.
[00:46:24.045 --> 00:46:28.167]  We're now going into the second generation of real soft kill.
[00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:34.592]  And you can already see the cancer rates, the way that people look, the health problems, all of it.
[00:46:34.592 --> 00:46:37.636]  What happens to the rats fed the GMO across the board?
[00:46:37.636 --> 00:46:41.881]  It's because it's designed to do it, every one of the crops.
[00:46:41.881 --> 00:46:43.343]  It's not like it's an accident it does it.
[00:46:44.684 --> 00:46:54.069]  There's a reason the Monsanto laboratories, you know, for 15 years, all of their scientists refused to eat GMO and have it trucked in to their cafeterias non-GMO.
[00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:57.871]  There's a reason all the ruling class won't eat GMO on record.
[00:46:57.871 --> 00:46:58.811]  Just look it up.
[00:46:58.811 --> 00:47:01.933]  Chinese communists have secret gardens non-GMO.
[00:47:01.933 --> 00:47:05.054]  British royalty have secret gardens non-GMO.
[00:47:05.054 --> 00:47:07.556]  Rich elite, you know, will not even touch it.
[00:47:07.556 --> 00:47:12.138]  Because, I mean, would they grab a cobra out of the bushes and slap it on their arm?
[00:47:12.138 --> 00:47:13.459]  I mean, of course you wouldn't.
[00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:16.480]  But we're brought up in it so we don't know.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:25.190]  First generation, the guinea pigs begun to be obese, lower IQs, smaller genitals, lower sperm counts.
[00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:32.958]  By second generation, off-the-chart cancer, obesity, deformity of the organs, almost complete infertility.
[00:47:32.958 --> 00:47:35.100]  Third generation, guys show guinea pigs
[00:47:37.142 --> 00:47:40.905]  Just type in guinea pigs, hair on tongues.
[00:47:40.905 --> 00:47:43.287]  That'll pull up the studies and photos.
[00:47:43.287 --> 00:47:48.911]  Hair on the tongues, 99.9% sterility, tumors growing all over them.
[00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:53.215]  I mean, the wages of the new world order is death.
[00:47:54.884 --> 00:48:03.792]  And you go out to California, where they're getting hit by the radiation clouds, where they're under the GMO, where all this is happening, ladies and gentlemen, and you go out to L.A.
[00:48:03.792 --> 00:48:19.426]  or San Diego or Malibu Beach, and you say to people, let's arrest all the gun owners, and you could even throw in, let's put them in a forced labor camp, and everyone, 90% of the people, will sign it, and they get excited.
[00:48:19.426 --> 00:48:19.787]  Yeah!
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.601]  You don't have to tell me, buddy.
[00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:27.382]  Because this, to them, is just they're fantasizing about darkness.
[00:48:27.382 --> 00:48:29.923]  They're fantasizing about sexy power.
[00:48:29.923 --> 00:48:33.844]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip of Californians.
[00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:38.165]  He's like, yeah, the Evil Whites Tea Party, we need to arrest them, take their guns.
[00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:40.385]  You don't have to tell me, buddy.
[00:48:40.385 --> 00:48:41.766]  And he says he signs with pleasure.
[00:48:42.526 --> 00:48:43.487]  Like, you don't have to tell me.
[00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:52.738]  And again, the reason this is such a genius video is if you all go out and do this and talk with the same, you gotta shuffle when you walk up, and you've gotta go, ooooh.
[00:48:52.738 --> 00:48:54.059]  I'm serious, it's a cult thing.
[00:48:54.059 --> 00:48:56.922]  The government cult talks like NPR, they're in a trance.
[00:48:56.922 --> 00:48:57.303]  You gotta go,
[00:48:57.663 --> 00:49:01.227]  Arrest the whites, take their guns, FEMA camp.
[00:49:01.227 --> 00:49:13.078]  They will get excited and they'll do the same little head bob with you and look at you in personal self-disgust of each other and then go, yeah, let's do it, because it's decadent and slimy to desecrate freedom.
[00:49:13.078 --> 00:49:16.121]  And they'll go, yeah, let's arrest the gun owners.
[00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:17.042]  Yeah, let's do it.
[00:49:17.042 --> 00:49:18.063]  We're sick freaks.
[00:49:18.063 --> 00:49:18.463]  Let's do it.
[00:49:18.463 --> 00:49:19.665]  Let's go ahead and go back to the tape.
[00:49:19.665 --> 00:49:19.925]  Here it is.
[00:49:20.265 --> 00:49:21.706]  Just a name and a signature.
[00:49:21.706 --> 00:49:31.034]  We're trying to just repeal the Second Amendment to make sure that only the criminals have the guns and get them out of the hands of the law-abiding citizens.
[00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:32.455]  The woman signs it.
[00:49:32.455 --> 00:49:34.337]  To repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:49:34.337 --> 00:49:37.099]  It's such an old-fashioned amendment.
[00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:43.044]  We're just making sure that the law-abiding gun owners have that right taken away.
[00:49:43.044 --> 00:49:43.544]  Alright.
[00:49:43.544 --> 00:49:44.365]  Thank you so much.
[00:49:45.908 --> 00:49:49.330]  We're going to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:51.931]  Only the police and the military need to have guns.
[00:49:51.931 --> 00:49:53.511]  We can trust them.
[00:49:53.511 --> 00:49:56.853]  They've never done anything wrong.
[00:49:56.853 --> 00:50:02.115]  And we're just going to get the legal registered guns off the street.
[00:50:02.115 --> 00:50:04.016]  You don't have to convince us, my friend.
[00:50:04.016 --> 00:50:10.359]  This will remove all the law-abiding registered gun owners and then the criminal sign.
[00:50:10.859 --> 00:50:18.162]  The criminals won't turn their guns in, so they'll still have their guns after we repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:50:18.162 --> 00:50:20.443]  Thanks for supporting that.
[00:50:20.443 --> 00:50:21.143]  Come on, bro.
[00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:24.445]  You don't want the kids to die in another massacre like Sandy Hook did?
[00:50:24.445 --> 00:50:26.966]  No, no, but I just... Come on, bro.
[00:50:26.966 --> 00:50:28.607]  I don't feel like saying anything right now.
[00:50:28.607 --> 00:50:29.427]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:29.427 --> 00:50:31.648]  We're going to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:50:39.116 --> 00:50:44.422]  Right there, on Drugs Report, Californians signed petition to ban and confiscate firearms.
[00:50:44.422 --> 00:50:48.627]  And the new news that's out, Big Sis coordinating gun confiscations.
[00:50:48.627 --> 00:50:49.608]  It's official.
[00:50:49.608 --> 00:50:57.918]  She's the one directing state police everywhere to illegally take veterans' guns without even a psychological adjudication that they're mentally ill.
[00:50:57.918 --> 00:50:59.020]  The kidnapping of veterans.
[00:51:02.128 --> 00:51:03.728]  Time and time again.
[00:51:03.728 --> 00:51:06.669]  You need to come here and help us.
[00:51:06.669 --> 00:51:08.129]  We need assistance.
[00:51:08.129 --> 00:51:08.929]  Please!
[00:51:08.929 --> 00:51:12.510]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:18.912]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:51:18.912 --> 00:51:21.432]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:51:21.432 --> 00:51:25.013]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.
[00:51:25.313 --> 00:51:28.495]  We are hurting down here and we need help!
[00:51:47.728 --> 00:51:48.609]  Immediately!
[00:51:48.609 --> 00:51:53.371]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.

[00:53:57.971 --> 00:53:59.136]  For the love of clean water.
[00:54:15.293 --> 00:54:24.641]  By, uh, by repealing the Second Amendment, what that'll do is we'll have a door-to-door gun confiscation against the white people, the right-wing extremists.
[00:54:24.641 --> 00:54:25.001]  Okay.
[00:54:25.001 --> 00:54:26.202]  Take away their guns.
[00:54:26.202 --> 00:54:26.903]  Well, birthday.
[00:54:26.903 --> 00:54:28.304]  What's the, what's the... Oh, my birthday.
[00:54:28.304 --> 00:54:29.365]  Yeah, your birthday, yeah.
[00:54:29.365 --> 00:54:37.752]  Just repealing the Second Amendment, door-to-door gun confiscations, then that way only the unregistered guns will be out, and it'll be, we'll be much safer that way.
[00:54:37.752 --> 00:54:38.232]  Got you.
[00:54:38.232 --> 00:54:38.913]  I believe that, man.
[00:54:38.913 --> 00:54:39.873]  Thank you for supporting that.
[00:54:39.873 --> 00:54:40.474]  No doubt, no doubt.
[00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:43.691]  All right, that's enough.
[00:54:43.691 --> 00:54:45.152]  Again, get this video.
[00:54:45.152 --> 00:54:47.274]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:47.274 --> 00:54:52.197]  But the easiest place to find it is DrudgeReport.com.
[00:54:52.197 --> 00:54:58.722]  On the left-hand side, you see a big old California, Republican California flag.
[00:54:58.722 --> 00:54:59.242]  America.
[00:54:59.242 --> 00:55:05.306]  Californians moved to ban, seize guns, carry foreign students scared of guns in the U.S.
[00:55:05.306 --> 00:55:06.867]  We're going to go to that in a moment.
[00:55:06.867 --> 00:55:09.169]  Senator, background checks amount to new tax.
[00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.252]  Oh yeah, that's the plan.
[00:55:12.252 --> 00:55:17.619]  Riffs in both parties complicate odds for Bill developing, but they'll get it after the next stage suiting.
[00:55:17.619 --> 00:55:23.266]  Nanny Bloomberg, if you shell a gun to your son, something's wrong in your family.
[00:55:23.266 --> 00:55:27.151]  This is a guy who has bodyguards, owns guns, owns jet copters.
[00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:31.211]  I mean, he's just a total predator.
[00:55:31.211 --> 00:55:33.471]  There was an article he was interviewed, where he said, I'm a technocrat.
[00:55:33.471 --> 00:55:35.592]  I love knowing everything about you and tracking it.
[00:55:35.592 --> 00:55:36.852]  I'll plan your life.
[00:55:36.852 --> 00:55:38.893]  No, you won't, you sick freak!
[00:55:38.893 --> 00:55:43.074]  You sicko!
[00:55:43.074 --> 00:55:48.896]  Critics question use of new NSA data center, working with Facebook, with attorney generals.
[00:55:48.896 --> 00:55:52.337]  They're just spying on everything.
[00:55:52.337 --> 00:55:53.878]  And the collapse is beginning.
[00:55:53.878 --> 00:55:57.399]  State buses hundreds of mentally ill patients to cities around the country.
[00:55:59.945 --> 00:56:13.788]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, what you've got to do is you've got to go out to areas in your community and go to these anti-gun rallies.
[00:56:13.788 --> 00:56:15.869]  And ladies and gentlemen, shoot video.
[00:56:15.869 --> 00:56:18.089]  Go up and say, hi, I'm a communist.
[00:56:18.089 --> 00:56:20.410]  I want to arrest all gun owners.
[00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:25.831]  And the people will say to you, especially if you have a hidden camera, they'll go, yes, my brother, soon is the time.
[00:56:26.926 --> 00:56:28.987]  And I've been telling my reporters for months, this is what I want to do.
[00:56:28.987 --> 00:56:29.727]  We're going to do it.
[00:56:29.727 --> 00:56:35.368]  I mean, we already sent reporters out and they said, here in Austin, once we register the guns, we're going to take them.
[00:56:35.368 --> 00:56:41.110]  And you've got to go and show people this is a cult of freak weirdos who just are in love with tyranny.
[00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:44.131]  Because they're so weak individually, they get off on this idea.
[00:56:44.131 --> 00:56:50.953]  But just go to gun rallies and go, soon, my brother, we will have the communism and we will arrest our enemies and put them in FEMA centers.
[00:56:50.953 --> 00:56:52.473]  And they're like, oh, yes, my brother.
[00:56:52.473 --> 00:56:54.074]  Because I've been to some of these things.
[00:56:54.074 --> 00:56:55.114]  I've been around these people.
[00:56:55.774 --> 00:56:56.675]  You think I'm joking?
[00:56:56.675 --> 00:57:03.101]  I have footage of them, communists in New York, saying we're going to put all the gun owners in Stalin camps.
[00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:04.543]  And I said, but Stalin killed people.
[00:57:04.543 --> 00:57:07.065]  And they go, yeah, too bad he didn't kill you.
[00:57:07.065 --> 00:57:08.246]  We're going to kill you.
[00:57:08.246 --> 00:57:15.733]  And of course, they couldn't kill a paper bag, but don't worry, they'll take your money, hire mercenaries to do it.
[00:57:15.733 --> 00:57:16.214]  You understand?
[00:57:18.547 --> 00:57:22.771]  Let's go to Kerry saying kids are scared to come to America because of the guns.
[00:57:22.771 --> 00:57:25.334]  What, from their country for only the government has the guns?
[00:57:25.334 --> 00:57:26.115]  Here it is.
[00:57:26.115 --> 00:57:32.141]  I've heard in a couple of quiet conversations with a few officials... Man, he's had Botox.
[00:57:32.141 --> 00:57:33.022]  ...is two things.
[00:57:33.022 --> 00:57:33.903]  Number one... He's like a villain.
[00:57:34.674 --> 00:57:38.737]  How safe it is over here in this country where people are not running around with guns.
[00:57:38.737 --> 00:57:40.179]  That's what evil does to you.
[00:57:40.179 --> 00:57:43.962]  And number two, look how empty he is.
[00:57:43.962 --> 00:57:54.470]  How some students, we had an interesting discussion about why fewer students are coming to, particularly from Japan, to study in the United States.
[00:57:54.470 --> 00:58:00.775]  And one of the responses I got from our officials, from conversations with parents here,
[00:58:01.656 --> 00:58:03.577]  Is that they're actually scared.
[00:58:03.577 --> 00:58:05.838]  They think they're not safe in the United States.
[00:58:05.838 --> 00:58:07.519]  Well, yeah, they're not safe from you.
[00:58:07.519 --> 00:58:13.402]  Actual travel studies show that people are scared of the government and the checkpoints and the TSA.
[00:58:13.402 --> 00:58:16.004]  That's real, not lies coming out of your mouth.
[00:58:17.037 --> 00:58:20.139]  Here's the FBI's own statistics over the last 20 years.
[00:58:20.139 --> 00:58:21.660]  49% drop in crime rate.
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:25.163]  And you and your brother and criminals, street thugs, are just like Gary.
[00:58:25.163 --> 00:58:26.403]  He's just a bigger one.
[00:58:26.403 --> 00:58:29.005]  They all instinctively hate good people.
[00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:30.166]  Let me spice it up to you.
[00:58:30.166 --> 00:58:31.867]  They hate you.
[00:58:31.867 --> 00:58:32.547]  You understand that?
[00:58:32.547 --> 00:58:35.750]  These criminals hate you because you're a good person.
[00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:36.930]  Figure that out.
[00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:38.131]  They're evil.
[00:58:38.131 --> 00:58:38.632]  Stay with us.
[00:58:43.277 --> 00:58:51.449]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.449 --> 00:58:57.298]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[00:59:20.051 --> 00:59:26.255]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:59:26.975 --> 00:59:27.736]  We're good to go!
[00:59:53.627 --> 00:59:56.009]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.009 --> 01:00:05.316]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.316 --> 01:00:06.618]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.618 --> 01:00:08.399]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.399 --> 01:00:10.140]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.722]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.722 --> 01:00:13.663]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.663 --> 01:00:17.486]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.486 --> 01:00:21.549]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:32.396]  I have met at my office one of the assistant, well one of the prosecutors, not the head.
[01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:34.638]  Austin prosecutor.
[01:00:34.638 --> 01:00:39.403]  And they came to my office as they were, well I'm not going to get into the whole story.
[01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:42.426]  And they showed me their card and I knew who they were with, that's how they were brought here.
[01:00:43.428 --> 01:00:45.749]  And I looked a person up.
[01:00:45.749 --> 01:00:48.010]  It was about a year ago, two years ago now.
[01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:53.993]  And they told me, they said, listen, the judges give illegal aliens $5 fines for drunk driving.
[01:00:53.993 --> 01:00:57.515]  And even if they run over somebody, they don't get charged.
[01:00:57.515 --> 01:00:58.876]  And we've just been told, do it.
[01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:09.757]  And then also covered how banks, like 10 years ago, came out and said, we give illegal aliens loans with no IDs, no proof, as part of a program to incentivize coming to America.
[01:01:09.757 --> 01:01:15.060]  It's like, you know, you can have your babies for free, and they put ads in Mexican newspapers, come over and have your kids for free.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.441]  It's about bankrupting America.
[01:01:16.441 --> 01:01:20.444]  The globalists are just going to loan America more fiat dollars to get real infrastructure.
[01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:26.949]  So anyway, you know, if it's a $5 million test of shrimp on treadmills, I'm not joking,
[01:01:27.878 --> 01:01:30.920]  I think it was a $5 million... Guys, look up study of shrimp on treadmills.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.282]  I think it was 5 mil a few years ago.
[01:01:33.282 --> 01:01:45.311]  Or, you know, whether it's a $10 million UT female masturbation study, or whether it's a study to teach elementary students how to masturbate, you know, $100 million program, Jocelyn Elders, whatever.
[01:01:46.898 --> 01:01:51.382]  Any way they can bankrupt us and just get us used to walking all over us.
[01:01:51.382 --> 01:01:53.143]  Here's the new article.
[01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:53.984]  There it is.
[01:01:53.984 --> 01:01:56.966]  Tax dollars fund shrimp on treadmills.
[01:01:56.966 --> 01:01:59.468]  Jell-O wrestling in Antarctica.
[01:01:59.468 --> 01:02:02.971]  Report says Federal Research Agency mismanaged $3 billion.
[01:02:06.434 --> 01:02:08.778]  Alex, you exaggerate.
[01:02:08.778 --> 01:02:10.841]  You said 5 million, it was 3 billion.
[01:02:10.841 --> 01:02:12.783]  Yeah, I remember the headline.
[01:02:12.783 --> 01:02:14.806]  It was 5 million for shrimp on treadmills.
[01:02:14.806 --> 01:02:16.168]  I think that's the Fox News headline.
[01:02:16.168 --> 01:02:19.854]  I think it was 5 million out of the 3 billion.
[01:02:19.854 --> 01:02:21.095]  Again, and they will take
[01:02:22.677 --> 01:02:27.379]  They will take an old lady's house who's eating dog food in the poorest part of Austin.
[01:02:27.379 --> 01:02:31.781]  I've done these reports years ago when I had time to do local reports, but you know about it.
[01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:42.585]  When an old 80-year-old woman can't pay her property taxes and is on $600 a month Social Security and has all these medical bills and literally, literally has to go get charity.
[01:02:42.585 --> 01:02:50.208]  And I tell you, I used to do my AXS TV show and I'd do one report on old people and I'd get hundreds of calls to my comment line with no crew.
[01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:58.158]  And I would hear these old ladies and old men begging going, I'm over here in a trailer and they say they're going to take my plot.
[01:02:58.158 --> 01:02:59.799]  The trailer's only worth probably $20,000.
[01:02:59.799 --> 01:03:02.622]  I've been in it, you know, 30-something years.
[01:03:02.622 --> 01:03:04.163]  There's holes in the roof.
[01:03:04.163 --> 01:03:10.209]  But they want it and they're going, they're coming next week to take my trailer!
[01:03:10.209 --> 01:03:14.533]  They're coming next week to take my trailer!
[01:03:15.771 --> 01:03:17.776]  And I have like a hundred phone calls.
[01:03:17.776 --> 01:03:21.245]  Mike Hanson used to take it over for me and he couldn't listen to it.
[01:03:21.245 --> 01:03:22.488]  It'll drive you crazy.
[01:03:22.488 --> 01:03:25.355]  You can't even call him back, much less go out there.
[01:03:28.752 --> 01:03:47.486]  And you go out there, and one guy's got colon cancer, and you see blood and bandages seeping out of his trousers, and he's sitting there going, yeah, I was in the quarry, war, my wife died of cancer, they're gonna take my three-inch grass, but I got out and I'm on it!
[01:03:47.486 --> 01:03:47.946]  I'm on it!
[01:03:48.306 --> 01:03:53.028]  I guess I'm trying to beat this cancer right now.
[01:03:53.028 --> 01:04:05.752]  If they won't take back the two weeks I was in the hospital, three-inch grass, $2,000 fines a day, and other objectionable material, and the zone person, I've had my hat in my hand.
[01:04:05.752 --> 01:04:09.594]  And I said, sir, I can't move these logs in the backyard.
[01:04:09.594 --> 01:04:13.635]  And I'm trying to get a company in to do it, but I'm on Social Security.
[01:04:13.635 --> 01:04:16.296]  And for some reason, the VA don't send a check no more.
[01:04:16.516 --> 01:04:18.858]  They're looking at you with all their teeth missing.
[01:04:18.858 --> 01:04:22.460]  Mr. Jones, I want to thank you.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.282]  That's why I can't do this anymore.
[01:04:25.282 --> 01:04:37.870]  Show that Obama can spend millions of dollars a night in a hotel and Biden can spend $500,000 while they're shooting kids up with poison shots and I can get hundreds of calls a week.
[01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:41.031]  They always target old people, the zoning department.
[01:04:41.031 --> 01:04:43.911]  And man, they take their houses and throw them in a nursing home.
[01:04:43.911 --> 01:04:46.552]  And now they wear uniforms with police badges.
[01:04:46.552 --> 01:04:48.213]  I want to tell all those people something.
[01:04:48.213 --> 01:04:49.853]  You're not going to get away with this.
[01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:53.174]  I hope you know God is going to strike your butt down.
[01:04:53.174 --> 01:04:54.954]  You are cursed!
[01:04:54.954 --> 01:04:55.754]  You understand that?
[01:04:55.754 --> 01:04:57.015]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.015 --> 01:04:57.455]  Stay with us.

[01:06:09.541 --> 01:06:13.222]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:06:13.222 --> 01:06:17.664]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:06:17.664 --> 01:06:22.705]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[01:06:22.705 --> 01:06:30.207]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus.
[01:06:30.367 --> 01:06:30.607]  I think so.
[01:07:00.478 --> 01:07:02.419]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:04.581]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:07:04.581 --> 01:07:10.305]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:07:10.305 --> 01:07:14.348]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:07:14.348 --> 01:07:18.271]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:07:18.271 --> 01:07:19.672]  The fact is, you are.
[01:07:19.672 --> 01:07:20.692]  We all are.
[01:07:20.692 --> 01:07:23.014]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:07:23.334 --> 01:07:31.881]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.282]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:36.745]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:07:36.745 --> 01:07:39.127]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[01:07:58.029 --> 01:07:59.912]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:08:05.543 --> 01:08:10.385]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.385 --> 01:08:11.985]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.985 --> 01:08:13.506]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:17.707]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:21.808]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:35.016]  You know, the Obama people like to quote the Bible and say, thou shalt not kill.
[01:08:35.016 --> 01:08:45.246]  But if you actually go to the Hebrew and Greek translations, thou shalt not murder means in cold blood, wrongly, someone who's innocent.
[01:08:46.291 --> 01:08:50.152]  And that's the common law of all cultures.
[01:08:50.152 --> 01:08:56.334]  What is basically illegal is going and killing someone who's done nothing.
[01:08:56.334 --> 01:08:59.735]  Knocking somebody on the head to basically rob them.
[01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:15.259]  And my son heard me talking about people that hurt innocents, how it will come back on them, and he happened to have in his book bag, he's here with me today, Discover's Bible, a large print Bible for early readers, and he was reading me from Genesis,
[01:09:16.636 --> 01:09:24.187]  Genesis 21 9 verse 6, anyone who murders man will be killed by man.
[01:09:24.187 --> 01:09:27.912]  This is because I have made man in my own likeness.
[01:09:29.315 --> 01:09:39.541]  So anyone who murders, murders, murders, not, not, okay, just to say thou shalt not kill, no, it's thou shalt not murder.
[01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:43.884]  Because, you know, you can see the government saying they're going to kill whole villages to get one bad guy.
[01:09:43.884 --> 01:09:45.865]  Why is that supposedly okay?
[01:09:45.865 --> 01:09:46.725]  Well, that is wrong.
[01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:47.686]  That is unjust war.
[01:09:49.542 --> 01:09:57.464]  And we've just accepted so many out-of-control things in this society.
[01:09:57.464 --> 01:10:04.166]  Now is the time to realize that the people are perishing for lack of knowledge.
[01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:09.127]  But again, there it is, Genesis 8, 21.
[01:10:09.127 --> 01:10:14.748]  I guess, is it chapter 9, verse 6?
[01:10:14.748 --> 01:10:17.989]  Anyone who murders man will be killed by man.
[01:10:19.397 --> 01:10:22.222]  That is because I have made man in my own likeness.
[01:10:22.222 --> 01:10:25.047]  That's the same thing as those that live by the sword die by the sword.
[01:10:25.047 --> 01:10:29.034]  It doesn't mean having a sword or defending yourself you're going to be killed by the sword.
[01:10:29.034 --> 01:10:31.198]  It means those that live by the sword.
[01:10:33.559 --> 01:10:35.880]  Living, you're out taking with the sword.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.622]  You will surely die by the sword.
[01:10:38.622 --> 01:10:45.006]  All of you that serve evil and think you're going to be on the winning team, because you're so scared of the system, you think you'll just, well, that's the winning team.
[01:10:45.006 --> 01:10:46.366]  I'll go curl up to that.
[01:10:46.366 --> 01:10:49.168]  You lead cursed lives for a reason.
[01:10:49.168 --> 01:10:51.629]  Your family's breaking up for a reason.
[01:10:51.629 --> 01:10:59.674]  Your child, because you trusted the system and took all the vaccines and eat GMO, because you lie to yourself, you're going to be cursed by your own actions.
[01:11:01.198 --> 01:11:02.740]  And that's not mumbo-jumbo.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.121]  That's not magic.
[01:11:04.121 --> 01:11:05.582]  That's common sense.
[01:11:05.582 --> 01:11:06.983]  Thank you, son, for bringing the book in.
[01:11:06.983 --> 01:11:11.467]  All right, I want to open the phones up in this second hour.
[01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:13.309]  A lot of stations join us in the second and third hour.
[01:11:13.309 --> 01:11:16.992]  I want to welcome all of you aboard here today.
[01:11:18.163 --> 01:11:21.004]  And we are here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:11:21.004 --> 01:11:21.365]  to 2 p.m.
[01:11:21.365 --> 01:11:24.766]  Central, back at night, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:11:24.766 --> 01:11:30.329]  If you are not a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber, you go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:33.230]  We're fighting the construction of the prison planet.
[01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:35.771]  With InfoWarsNews.com, that'll also get you there.
[01:11:35.771 --> 01:11:36.431]  11 memberships.
[01:11:36.431 --> 01:11:37.572]  I didn't plug anything last hour.
[01:11:37.572 --> 01:11:39.353]  11 memberships for $5.95 a month.
[01:11:39.353 --> 01:11:39.553]  That is...
[01:11:42.935 --> 01:11:45.598]  Uh, 55 cents or less per person.
[01:11:45.598 --> 01:11:49.662]  One username passcode, create an original code you can share, give it to friends and family.
[01:11:49.662 --> 01:11:52.204]  I say you can probably give it up to 50 people.
[01:11:52.204 --> 01:11:59.532]  And just say, hey, here's your gift of a username passcode to see all these films in high def, to see the nightly news, to see video of the radio show.
[01:12:01.355 --> 01:12:07.337]  Also, send people the free iPhone app or the free Android apps that are in the Listen page of Infowars.com.
[01:12:07.337 --> 01:12:10.058]  Just click on that tab or PrisonPlanet.com will take you there.
[01:12:10.058 --> 01:12:20.081]  I mean, the Eddie Craig presents how to protect your rights as an American citizen, Air Force officer, and then, of course, Nacogdoches Sheriff's Deputy that saw the corruption and stood up against it.
[01:12:20.081 --> 01:12:28.263]  Probably one of the best, most well-spoken, not patriot mythology, but real hardcore pro se, just showing how basically everything the police do is illegal now.
[01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:32.522]  And most police don't even know it, because it's all done in legalese.
[01:12:32.522 --> 01:12:34.583]  Police all need to see it.
[01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.805]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:36.805 --> 01:12:39.347]  And again, that just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:12:39.347 --> 01:12:46.512]  If you want to support us by the ProPure water filters, the lowest price out there, promo code WATER at InfoWaterStore.com.
[01:12:46.512 --> 01:12:49.155]  Promo code WATER gets you 10% off the already lowest price.
[01:12:49.155 --> 01:12:56.680]  We've now launched the Seed Center, a year of research, the best reviews, the non-GMO, non-hybrid heirloom seeds.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.382]  We've got cases that have
[01:12:59.303 --> 01:13:01.486]  You know, 50,000 seeds at the lowest price.
[01:13:01.486 --> 01:13:03.930]  5,000 seeds at the lowest price.
[01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:04.351]  50,000.
[01:13:04.351 --> 01:13:06.193]  10,000.
[01:13:06.193 --> 01:13:10.480]  We're now carrying six different companies, six different brands at infowarestore.com.
[01:13:13.872 --> 01:13:17.655]  And, you know, these seeds will save many of them a hundred years, by the way.
[01:13:17.655 --> 01:13:21.677]  So you can also buy a couple of this seed vault.
[01:13:21.677 --> 01:13:22.418]  It's a great system.
[01:13:22.418 --> 01:13:24.940]  The seed arc is amazing.
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:25.520]  All of it.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.582]  And they all calculate basically out of the same price.
[01:13:27.582 --> 01:13:29.123]  Depends on how many seeds you get.
[01:13:29.123 --> 01:13:31.804]  And we have these at the lowest prices.
[01:13:31.804 --> 01:13:41.071]  I've instructed Weldon Henson, who heads up the store with Matt back there, to have the lowest prices, unless somebody's doing a bait and switch on eBay or something.
[01:13:41.071 --> 01:13:42.592]  But the point is, is that
[01:13:44.403 --> 01:13:45.704]  This supports the broadcast.
[01:13:45.704 --> 01:13:47.125]  We sell things we believe in.
[01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:48.606]  Infowarshealth.com.
[01:13:48.606 --> 01:13:50.707]  The best vitamins, minerals, products there.
[01:13:50.707 --> 01:13:56.551]  Purchasing from us also funds the operation so we can boldly go 110% up against the enemy.
[01:13:56.551 --> 01:14:00.774]  Now, I want to give the number out on these articles.
[01:14:00.774 --> 01:14:03.035]  What do you think of gold being artificially plunged?
[01:14:03.035 --> 01:14:04.717]  I mean, it's on record.
[01:14:04.717 --> 01:14:05.537]  It's all staged.
[01:14:05.537 --> 01:14:07.358]  I'm gonna get some experts on this week.
[01:14:07.358 --> 01:14:12.902]  Anybody can pull up the articles where they admit the big banks go in there and short sell.
[01:14:12.902 --> 01:14:13.803]  They go in there and they
[01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:15.964]  Thank you.
[01:14:26.301 --> 01:14:33.002]  And then basically sell, also, their own gold holdings into the market at reduced prices.
[01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:39.104]  I mean, Gordon Brown sold England's, what was it, a decade ago, or more, gold supply at a third of what it was worth.
[01:14:39.104 --> 01:14:40.564]  You can look that up.
[01:14:40.564 --> 01:14:44.105]  I mean, it is just crazy what they're doing.
[01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:47.525]  And I've told people, they can drive anything down.
[01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:51.026]  They can do anything artificial now, but not long-term.
[01:14:51.026 --> 01:14:52.627]  They can do anything.
[01:14:52.627 --> 01:14:54.407]  They could probably make gold be worth zero.
[01:14:55.831 --> 01:14:58.233]  You know, down to 10 cents.
[01:14:58.233 --> 01:15:02.397]  But in the real market it won't be, and at that price you wouldn't be able to buy any.
[01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.299]  They could say the moon was made out of cheese.
[01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:07.682]  They could say 2 plus 2 equals 10, and they now teach that in public schools.
[01:15:07.682 --> 01:15:13.748]  They actually teach it could be whatever you think, to just create total disassociation from reality.
[01:15:13.748 --> 01:15:18.332]  I think that right now the question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[01:15:18.332 --> 01:15:20.534]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[01:15:21.114 --> 01:15:23.236]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:15:23.236 --> 01:15:25.717]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[01:15:25.717 --> 01:15:30.701]  Jim Iorio, you say we've got some downside here, a correction in the markets.
[01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:31.382]  Fine.
[01:15:31.382 --> 01:15:34.984]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:15:34.984 --> 01:15:42.209]  Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt and that we won't go any lower than, say, 5% down from here?
[01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:48.033]  Of course we are, because if we look at the economic data, there's nothing to get excited about in that.
[01:15:48.033 --> 01:15:53.696]  So we, you know, yesterday we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand their balance.
[01:15:53.696 --> 01:16:00.800]  Now separately, it's in the Financial Times of London, AP Reuters, Time Magazine, that, hey, there's a global government run by private megabanks.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:07.403]  They're going to need $100 trillion in the next decade of your tax money via carbon taxes, Tobin taxes, and global VAT.
[01:16:08.926 --> 01:16:12.216]  And they're going to fix the world economy by running the planet.
[01:16:12.216 --> 01:16:14.563]  And by the way, they're exempt from the taxes themselves.
[01:16:14.563 --> 01:16:15.706]  From EU bureaucrats up.
[01:16:16.926 --> 01:16:22.271]  But if you go, hey, I think that's a terrible idea, they go, whoa, Southern Broadway Law Center, ADL, this doesn't exist.
[01:16:22.271 --> 01:16:26.274]  There are crazy people that believe there's a global takeover by megabanks.
[01:16:26.274 --> 01:16:28.977]  Yeah, the John Birch Society, they said that in the 50s.
[01:16:28.977 --> 01:16:39.486]  Man, they're really bad people for being absolutely accurate 60-plus years before their time because they had high-level military officers that weren't traitors who were let in on the operation that warned them.
[01:16:40.266 --> 01:16:42.028]  Man, yeah, they're kooks.
[01:16:42.028 --> 01:16:53.497]  Yeah, those patriots that Alex Jones, you know, he said 17 years ago They were setting up a new world order run by mega banks because he happened to have read books by Barry Goldwater He was witnessing it all as a senator.
[01:16:53.497 --> 01:16:54.057]  Yeah, man.
[01:16:54.057 --> 01:17:09.230]  He's a bad guy for being informed I mean this is getting so out of control This is good, this is a war against reality and and I want your take on this clip
[01:17:10.163 --> 01:17:12.865]  Again, it's up at DrugsReport.com on the left-hand side.
[01:17:12.865 --> 01:17:14.046]  I'm going to have it reposted.
[01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.368]  Have them repost it, too.
[01:17:15.368 --> 01:17:19.571]  I want... at PrisonPlanetInfoWarsRedLink.
[01:17:19.571 --> 01:17:25.637]  It's got the clips of Californians saying, arrest the partiers, take all their guns, put them in jail.
[01:17:25.637 --> 01:17:25.937]  Here it is.
[01:17:28.092 --> 01:17:37.454]  By, uh, by repealing the Second Amendment, what that'll do is we'll have a door-to-door gun confiscation against the white people, the right-wing extremists.
[01:17:37.454 --> 01:17:37.814]  Okay.
[01:17:37.814 --> 01:17:39.015]  Take away their guns.
[01:17:39.015 --> 01:17:39.715]  Well, birthday.
[01:17:39.715 --> 01:17:41.155]  What's the, what's the... Oh, my birthday.
[01:17:41.155 --> 01:17:42.175]  Yeah, your birthday, yeah.
[01:17:42.175 --> 01:17:50.537]  Just repealing the Second Amendment, door-to-door gun confiscations, then that way only the unregistered guns will be out, and it'll be, we'll be much safer that way.
[01:17:50.537 --> 01:17:51.037]  Got you.
[01:17:51.037 --> 01:17:51.698]  I believe that, man.
[01:17:51.698 --> 01:17:52.658]  Thank you for supporting that.
[01:17:52.658 --> 01:17:53.278]  No doubt, no doubt.
[01:17:54.435 --> 01:17:55.595]  Alright, it just goes on and on.
[01:17:55.595 --> 01:17:56.316]  That's enough.

[01:17:59.977 --> 01:18:02.697]  But I'm telling you, all of you, it's time to fight.
[01:18:02.697 --> 01:18:05.318]  Take your iPhone, take your camera.
[01:18:05.318 --> 01:18:07.899]  You don't have to be a quote, expert to fight the tyranny.
[01:18:07.899 --> 01:18:09.319]  These are zombies you're talking about.
[01:18:09.319 --> 01:18:10.880]  I mean, you're like a god compared to them.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.000]  I'm very sad for them, but literally.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.061]  Go out to an anti-gun rally, or go to a Democratic Party rally.
[01:18:16.061 --> 01:18:16.882]  Have a hidden camera.
[01:18:16.882 --> 01:18:17.622]  They're very cheap now.
[01:18:18.702 --> 01:18:19.343]  I don't know.
[01:18:36.463 --> 01:18:41.887]  Fourteen of them say you can't tape or videotape people without them knowing.
[01:18:41.887 --> 01:18:43.428]  But again, that's not even in a public place.
[01:18:43.428 --> 01:18:46.171]  But the cops are arresting people that film on the side of the highway.
[01:18:46.171 --> 01:18:50.394]  If you film cops in Illinois from your own car, they take you to jail.
[01:18:50.394 --> 01:18:52.695]  I mean, it doesn't matter how many times the court throw it out.
[01:18:52.695 --> 01:18:57.959]  The point is, I think everybody, to give a little lesson there on filming in public because it's such a free country.
[01:18:59.048 --> 01:19:10.638]  You go out and go to their meetings and go, yeah, man, I think we ought to just arrest all the libertarians and put them in a forced labor camp and then they could be productive part of the economy.
[01:19:10.638 --> 01:19:14.581]  And I guarantee you they're going to say, yes, yes, do what Veritas Project's done.
[01:19:14.581 --> 01:19:15.502]  Do what we do.
[01:19:15.502 --> 01:19:16.563]  Do what Mark Dice has done.
[01:19:16.563 --> 01:19:23.769]  I'm telling you, we've got to have a counteroffensive against their counteroffensive and really go show who they are.
[01:19:23.769 --> 01:19:24.950]  That's what will bring them down.
[01:19:25.964 --> 01:19:32.014]  I mean, I've gotten video, you know, over the years of them saying they're going to bring in world government, they're going to break up the family.
[01:19:32.014 --> 01:19:33.096]  Now they say it publicly.
[01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:35.718]  I want to get your take on all this.
[01:19:35.718 --> 01:19:36.298]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:36.298 --> 01:19:37.198]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:37.198 --> 01:19:45.402]  And this is the big news up at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:19:45.402 --> 01:19:47.984]  Big Sis coordinating gun confiscations.
[01:19:47.984 --> 01:19:51.825]  And this also just broke at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:51.825 --> 01:19:59.009]  Because an illegal alien had a unique cultural background, he's allowed to... Well, I'm going to tell you about this when we come back.
[01:20:02.443 --> 01:20:05.584]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop 6 hits.
[01:20:05.584 --> 01:20:06.964]  But what about the 7?
[01:20:06.964 --> 01:20:11.226]  Unlike Ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[01:20:11.226 --> 01:20:12.786]  And it just won't quit.
[01:20:12.786 --> 01:20:15.607]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prefer.
[01:20:15.607 --> 01:20:19.468]  Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[01:20:19.468 --> 01:20:21.629]  That means safety and peace of mind.
[01:20:21.629 --> 01:20:24.070]  Buy yours at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:28.071]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:20:28.071 --> 01:20:30.352]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:20:30.512 --> 01:20:39.858]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:39.858 --> 01:20:40.639]  This capitalism?
[01:20:40.639 --> 01:20:46.923]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:46.923 --> 01:20:47.724]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:47.724 --> 01:20:50.866]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:20:50.866 --> 01:20:51.806]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.806 --> 01:20:52.887]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:20:52.887 --> 01:20:53.527]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.527 --> 01:20:53.808]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:01.253 --> 01:21:04.315]  The coming financial collapse is real.
[01:21:04.315 --> 01:21:07.537]  The subsequent social unrest will happen.
[01:21:07.537 --> 01:21:11.980]  Even if you made it out of suburbia alive, where would you take your family?
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:19.945]  Act now to secure your survival retreat in the American Redoubt with the experts at survivalretreatconsulting.com.
[01:21:19.945 --> 01:21:26.870]  The American Redoubt is the designated safe haven for all liberty-minded patriots relocating to Idaho, Montana,
[01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:28.311]  We're good to go.
[01:21:51.051 --> 01:21:51.971]  Water.
[01:21:51.971 --> 01:21:52.432]  Energy.
[01:21:52.432 --> 01:21:53.752]  Food.
[01:21:53.752 --> 01:21:54.592]  Defense.
[01:21:54.592 --> 01:21:57.573]  SurvivalRetreatConsulting.com.
[01:21:57.573 --> 01:22:00.774]  SurvivalRetreatConsulting.com.
[01:22:00.774 --> 01:22:02.715]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:22:02.715 --> 01:22:05.416]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:22:05.416 --> 01:22:11.077]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:22:11.077 --> 01:22:14.558]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:22:14.558 --> 01:22:16.379]  You may think out of sight, out of mind.
[01:22:16.639 --> 01:22:18.440]  And so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.821]  The fact is you are.
[01:22:19.821 --> 01:22:20.841]  We all are.
[01:22:20.841 --> 01:22:23.482]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:22:23.482 --> 01:22:31.726]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:22:31.966 --> 01:22:33.346]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:22:33.346 --> 01:22:36.807]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:22:36.807 --> 01:22:39.167]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:22:39.167 --> 01:22:43.708]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:51.469]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex and check out their spring specials.
[01:22:51.469 --> 01:22:57.951]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:22:57.951 --> 01:22:59.791]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:23:00.799 --> 01:23:03.181]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[01:23:03.181 --> 01:23:06.723]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[01:23:06.723 --> 01:23:10.706]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[01:23:10.706 --> 01:23:16.590]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:19.492]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[01:23:19.492 --> 01:23:26.477]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[01:23:27.037 --> 01:23:32.901]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[01:23:32.901 --> 01:23:39.025]  EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[01:23:39.025 --> 01:23:44.809]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs, and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[01:23:45.049 --> 01:23:46.670]  Visit EasyArmor.net.
[01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:49.832]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net.
[01:23:49.832 --> 01:23:50.732]  Or call 888-58-ARMOR.
[01:23:50.732 --> 01:23:51.313]  That's 888-582-7667.
[01:23:51.313 --> 01:23:51.973]  EasyArmor.net.
[01:23:51.973 --> 01:23:53.334]  Ultimate door security made easy.
[01:24:22.208 --> 01:24:28.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are capturing it right now, during the break.
[01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:34.671]  During the break, out there on the television, and you know with these new DVRs the last few years, you can just rewind what was live.
[01:24:34.671 --> 01:24:48.375]  You've probably already seen it, they now have Pillsbury Doughboy ads, where the TSA gropes the Pillsbury Doughboy, and it is a bunch of fun to have this basically done to him.
[01:24:49.577 --> 01:24:51.258]  Again, everything is acclamation.
[01:24:51.258 --> 01:24:59.004]  The TV shows, the radio, the mainline radio, the print stuff.
[01:24:59.004 --> 01:25:03.207]  He loves it too when he gets groped.
[01:25:03.207 --> 01:25:05.229]  Oh, he likes it.
[01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:06.150]  Sir.
[01:25:06.150 --> 01:25:06.970]  I'll get it together.
[01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:07.851]  I promise.
[01:25:07.851 --> 01:25:11.434]  Look, the TSA's wearing like a police badge.
[01:25:11.434 --> 01:25:12.875]  Oh, going for his crotch.
[01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:15.177]  How happy are folks who save hundreds of dollars switching to Geico?
[01:25:17.364 --> 01:25:21.025]  Oh, it's a Geico ad with the Pillsbury boy?
[01:25:21.025 --> 01:25:23.106]  So I guess they're doing unified deals now.
[01:25:23.106 --> 01:25:27.327]  I see more and more ads where they, it's like Predator vs. Alien.
[01:25:27.327 --> 01:25:37.930]  And again, oh, it's the new sacrament in America to have your junk grubbed.
[01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:39.910]  John is saying that Rockefeller owns Geico.
[01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:40.991]  Look into that.
[01:25:40.991 --> 01:25:42.391]  Look into the conglomerate that owns it.
[01:25:44.065 --> 01:25:56.307]  By the way, up at Infowars.com right now, illegal immigrant DUI killer ruled incompetent because of his unique cultural background.
[01:25:56.307 --> 01:26:02.868]  A self-confessed illegal immigrant in Milford, Mass., faces 15 years of found guilty of vehicular homicide.
[01:26:02.868 --> 01:26:13.190]  But it's a big if, as it stands right now, Nicholas D. Gauman has been found incompetent to stand trial because he doesn't speak English and doesn't understand the American legal system.
[01:26:14.571 --> 01:26:16.612]  And again, illegal aliens are allowed to drink and drive.
[01:26:16.612 --> 01:26:24.575]  They're allowed to... I mean, it's on record where sheriffs arrest them and then the prosecutors let them go.
[01:26:24.575 --> 01:26:30.257]  Critics say he had an accomplice, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick.
[01:26:30.257 --> 01:26:32.238]  Deval Patrick.
[01:26:32.238 --> 01:26:38.260]  And it goes on to say that... say that, well, he's basically above the law.
[01:26:40.441 --> 01:26:52.548]  By the way, the Travis County prosecutor got arrested while drinking and driving, and she's admitted to it, up by the entrance to Steiner Ranch, out by Lakeway.
[01:26:52.548 --> 01:26:55.730]  And I actually know people that know her, and I mean, she sounds like...
[01:26:56.693 --> 01:27:00.836]  She's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[01:27:00.836 --> 01:27:02.957]  And she's like, I was having an evening.
[01:27:02.957 --> 01:27:03.878]  Yeah, I did.
[01:27:03.878 --> 01:27:16.766]  Reportedly, according to the witnesses that called 9-1-1 on her, and then the cops that showed up, she was driving down the wrong side of the road, doing circles in a major highway, bombed out of her brain.
[01:27:16.766 --> 01:27:17.346]  There it is.
[01:27:17.346 --> 01:27:19.868]  After drunk driving arrest, Travis County D.A.
[01:27:19.868 --> 01:27:22.229]  apologizes, says she'll remain in office.
[01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:23.130]  And I know people
[01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:37.088]  One of my friends had some guys jump out of a car one time, follow him to his house, get in his face, because they claimed that he cut him off.
[01:27:37.088 --> 01:27:38.489]  He can tell the story later if he wants.
[01:27:38.489 --> 01:27:42.151]  He didn't say I couldn't tell, but I'm not going to say his name, but he's a well-known guy in Austin.
[01:27:42.151 --> 01:27:43.592]  And they jump out, get in his face.
[01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.373]  He gets back in their face.
[01:27:45.373 --> 01:27:46.273]  He's a big guy.
[01:27:46.273 --> 01:27:48.475]  They run off and leave.
[01:27:48.475 --> 01:27:53.418]  And then his brother looks like him and was probably well...
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.722]  More well-known at the time, because they both, you know, had celebrity jobs.
[01:27:58.722 --> 01:28:03.365]  One's a country music singer, the other a champion rodeo guy.
[01:28:03.365 --> 01:28:14.031]  And this prosecutor, even when there were witnesses and everything and, hey, it's not my brother, it's me, was still going to prosecute him.
[01:28:14.031 --> 01:28:15.952]  And didn't care, reportedly.
[01:28:17.856 --> 01:28:22.137]  Until they had all these witnesses and everybody that know that this is the person.
[01:28:22.137 --> 01:28:27.458]  And then they had to drop that anyway because he hadn't even done anything.
[01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:33.679]  And the brother had to go before the Travis County Grand Jury and said, I want to speak to him.
[01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:36.740]  And went and said, this prosecutor is crazy.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:37.780]  This is my brother.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:38.600]  This is me.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.500]  This is my house.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.501]  This is my truck.
[01:28:41.501 --> 01:28:44.081]  My brother wasn't even in town when this happened.
[01:28:44.081 --> 01:28:45.322]  And they don't even care.
[01:28:45.322 --> 01:28:47.362]  And the Grand Jury, no build.
[01:28:49.795 --> 01:28:53.656]  And again, it's like the Michael Morton case up in Williamson County.
[01:28:53.656 --> 01:28:55.096]  It's world famous now.
[01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:57.437]  He stayed in jail 20-something years.
[01:28:57.437 --> 01:28:59.517]  His wife killed.
[01:28:59.517 --> 01:29:03.298]  Bloody bandana outside with an ex-con killer's blood on it.
[01:29:03.298 --> 01:29:06.839]  And the prosecutor asked the state police, you know, let's not do anything with that.
[01:29:06.839 --> 01:29:19.022]  And it kept the guy in jail because, you know, a decade or so into his sentence, they had all the DNA sample, had the DNA sample of the guy that had already killed later and been arrested and didn't want to test it.
[01:29:20.242 --> 01:29:23.763]  And then even when the DNA came out that it wasn't him, they wanted to keep him in jail.
[01:29:23.763 --> 01:29:25.324]  A father with no criminal record.
[01:29:25.324 --> 01:29:37.368]  It's like, the more innocent you are, the more under the jail, I guess like the devil gives them more lumps of sugar in their coffee when they burn innocent people.
[01:29:37.368 --> 01:29:43.950]  Alright, we'll be right back, but uh... Warren Buffett owns GEICO, yeah that's what I thought, and that's Rockefeller, yeah.
[01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:47.111]  So GEICO teaching you that your children being roped is a good thing.
[01:29:47.111 --> 01:29:48.052]  Everybody should boycott
[01:29:50.133 --> 01:29:51.516]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.516 --> 01:29:54.062]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.062 --> 01:29:56.788]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.246 --> 01:30:04.648]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:30:04.648 --> 01:30:10.690]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:30:10.690 --> 01:30:14.572]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:33:25.069 --> 01:33:27.174]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:27.174 --> 01:33:28.037]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:28.037 --> 01:33:28.999]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:28.999 --> 01:33:29.460]  We're here.
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:29.661]  Back.
[01:33:30.808 --> 01:33:49.842]  Every weeknight, 7 o'clock central, with myself hosting the news, Jakari Jackson, of course, David Knight, Leigh-Anne McAdoo, Rob, Dude, and I mentioned John Bowne, so many others, Darren McBreen, Paul Watson, you name it.
[01:33:49.842 --> 01:33:55.206]  By the way, Paul Watson believes he's discovered the location of Bilderberg, 2013, outside London.
[01:33:55.206 --> 01:33:56.687]  He lives now in London.
[01:34:00.373 --> 01:34:07.741]  Are on the edge of London and so he's going to be covering Bilderberg 2013 in June.
[01:34:07.741 --> 01:34:12.526]  And who knows if I will be parachuting into the confab.
[01:34:12.526 --> 01:34:14.268]  I mean that figuratively.
[01:34:14.268 --> 01:34:14.968]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:15.742 --> 01:34:18.223]  Alright, I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:34:18.223 --> 01:34:20.044]  Here's some of the news coming up after I do that.
[01:34:20.044 --> 01:34:22.244]  Big Sis coordinating gun confiscations.
[01:34:22.244 --> 01:34:23.825]  I think that's kind of important news.
[01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:28.126]  Illegal immigrant DUI killer ruled incompetent because of his unique cultural background.
[01:34:28.126 --> 01:34:30.667]  They're looking at just releasing him.
[01:34:30.667 --> 01:34:37.470]  They're reporting in the local news saying that everything wasn't in Spanish in Massachusetts and so it's that fault.
[01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:40.571]  He didn't know he could drink three times the legal limit and go kill some people.
[01:34:42.631 --> 01:34:44.593]  And when he drinks and drives, he gets off.
[01:34:44.593 --> 01:34:47.736]  And when the Travis County prosecutor does, she gets off.
[01:34:47.736 --> 01:34:48.897]  She sounded so delusional.
[01:34:48.897 --> 01:34:50.559]  Can somebody find her on local news?
[01:34:50.559 --> 01:34:52.241]  I heard her on 590, our local affiliate.
[01:34:52.241 --> 01:34:53.963]  They were playing clips of her.
[01:34:53.963 --> 01:34:55.845]  She was going, I had an evening.
[01:34:57.151 --> 01:35:04.855]  I mean, let me tell you, folks, I don't drink a lot, but sometimes, you know, I'll go out to a party or an event or a wedding, and it's hard to not drink a couple glasses of wine.
[01:35:04.855 --> 01:35:09.398]  And then I will sit there and eat something, drink coffee, and wait.
[01:35:09.398 --> 01:35:17.182]  Or, you know, find somebody there and say, hey, take me home, just because they'll take you to jail, you know, for one beer in your body now.
[01:35:17.182 --> 01:35:21.965]  If you drink a beer and get pulled over right then, that's over 0.8 or whatever it is.
[01:35:21.965 --> 01:35:23.326]  I've talked to medical doctors about it.
[01:35:23.766 --> 01:35:28.547]  And the bars are right there, everybody knows, everybody's drinking, and it's all selectively enforced.
[01:35:28.547 --> 01:35:36.470]  I'm surprised this Travis Chowning, sheriff's deputy, did his job and arrested this lady.
[01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:41.151]  But he'll have a terrible future in his, you know, but I mean, they had to.
[01:35:41.151 --> 01:35:44.772]  She was driving on the wrong side, doing circles in a major highway.
[01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:48.213]  I mean, she's like, I had a little one.
[01:35:48.213 --> 01:35:49.374]  Oh, I bet you did, lady.
[01:35:50.543 --> 01:35:51.683]  I mean, I bet you did.
[01:35:51.683 --> 01:35:56.904]  I'd have to drink like four bottles of wine to be that drunk.
[01:35:56.904 --> 01:35:59.625]  Oh my God, in the interview, she sounds like she's had a lobotomy.
[01:35:59.625 --> 01:36:01.326]  I mean, I've heard it over and over on a local radio.
[01:36:01.326 --> 01:36:04.686]  She's like, I had a little evening myself.
[01:36:04.686 --> 01:36:06.387]  You had a little evening?
[01:36:06.387 --> 01:36:08.427]  I mean, I'm just so sick of these people.
[01:36:08.427 --> 01:36:11.128]  That lady, by the way, lets illegal aliens go every day.
[01:36:11.128 --> 01:36:15.409]  So when she gets a good fat, let me tell you, that whole wealthy area by Steiner Ranch and
[01:36:16.468 --> 01:36:20.373]  Down in Lakeway, you know, with the $5 million houses.
[01:36:20.373 --> 01:36:22.917]  I go over there to see friends sometimes, and I want to be out of there by 10.
[01:36:22.917 --> 01:36:25.640]  Because I've been pulled over, haven't been drinking.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.943]  I mean, it's like piranhas.
[01:36:27.943 --> 01:36:30.847]  Look, you kind of passed that line back there, and I know I didn't.
[01:36:31.488 --> 01:36:33.169]  And I hadn't been drinking.
[01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:34.710]  Mind if I search the vehicle?
[01:36:34.710 --> 01:36:37.032]  Yeah, I do mind.
[01:36:37.032 --> 01:36:39.534]  You're not going to establish your fake probable cause.
[01:36:39.534 --> 01:36:41.615]  OK, staring at my car.
[01:36:41.615 --> 01:36:42.656]  I mean, it's all good.
[01:36:42.656 --> 01:36:46.239]  Go arrest all your drunk bosses driving down the wrong side of the road.
[01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:47.219]  Leave me alone.
[01:36:47.219 --> 01:36:49.461]  OK, leave me alone.
[01:36:49.461 --> 01:36:51.423]  Leave me alone.
[01:36:51.423 --> 01:36:55.906]  I mean, I saw a well-known cop drinking tequila in a restaurant.
[01:36:55.906 --> 01:36:56.726]  And I looked at him.
[01:36:56.726 --> 01:36:57.687]  The guy probably weighed 250 pounds.
[01:36:59.255 --> 01:37:00.776]  Waddle out, go to a movie.
[01:37:00.776 --> 01:37:02.836]  I went to the same theater.
[01:37:02.836 --> 01:37:05.757]  I watched him get out with his wife two hours later and drive off.
[01:37:05.757 --> 01:37:08.278]  I didn't call the cops on him.
[01:37:08.278 --> 01:37:09.879]  Because I'm not a sick freak.
[01:37:09.879 --> 01:37:12.519]  I'm like, he probably has a little alcohol in him.
[01:37:12.519 --> 01:37:15.781]  But I mean, that doesn't do anything to you when you weigh 250 pounds.
[01:37:15.781 --> 01:37:18.722]  I watched him drink a beer and two tequilas.
[01:37:18.722 --> 01:37:20.702]  Probably all out of his system in two hours.
[01:37:20.702 --> 01:37:25.064]  But let me tell you, most people would have called the cops on him.
[01:37:25.064 --> 01:37:27.244]  But my whole issue is, I am watching.
[01:37:27.244 --> 01:37:28.645]  Okay, I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:37:31.067 --> 01:37:33.729]  I want to get your take on everything.
[01:37:33.729 --> 01:37:36.790]  Guys, when you launched my phone system, I noticed at the start of the show it wasn't launched.
[01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:43.354]  I forgot to launch that, so I'll probably actually need the phone system to take calls.
[01:37:43.354 --> 01:37:44.894]  800-259-9231 and we will get you up on air.
[01:37:50.077 --> 01:37:54.299]  We should have like a flight check, you know, like reboot computer, flight check.
[01:37:54.299 --> 01:37:56.240]  We actually do have one of those.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.561]  Okay, call system is turned on.
[01:37:58.561 --> 01:37:59.421]  That's always important.
[01:37:59.421 --> 01:38:00.702]  Check.
[01:38:00.702 --> 01:38:01.702]  Lights are turned on.
[01:38:01.702 --> 01:38:03.163]  Check.
[01:38:03.163 --> 01:38:04.764]  Toilet paper is on toilet paper roll.
[01:38:04.764 --> 01:38:06.044]  David Rockefeller roll.
[01:38:06.044 --> 01:38:09.966]  I don't even know what that joke means at this point.
[01:38:09.966 --> 01:38:13.228]  So that is some of the news there.
[01:38:13.228 --> 01:38:15.609]  Okay, we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:38:17.366 --> 01:38:19.848]  Let's talk to Stephen in Florida.
[01:38:19.848 --> 01:38:20.848]  You're on the air, Stephen.
[01:38:20.848 --> 01:38:22.269]  Welcome.
[01:38:22.269 --> 01:38:24.330]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:45.263]  I wanted to comment on this video with Mark Dice that you're talking about, but first of all, I wanted to ask you, you've done, just done a bunch of interviews with Steve Pachinick, who is with Delta Force, and I just wanted, if you have ever heard from him or know yourself of anything about John Lear, who was also with Delta Force, and his intel that he's put out on the internet,
[01:38:45.595 --> 01:38:48.776]  You're talking about the son of the inventor of the Learjet in Fortune?
[01:38:48.776 --> 01:38:50.776]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:50.776 --> 01:38:52.077]  Yeah, here's the deal.
[01:38:52.077 --> 01:38:56.038]  I'm not knocking Lear, who says, you know, space aliens and stuff.
[01:38:56.038 --> 01:38:59.458]  I can't prove all that, so I don't go there.
[01:38:59.458 --> 01:39:06.100]  Steve Pchenik is even more than who he says he is.
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:11.261]  I mean, he's really an interesting person on so many fronts.
[01:39:15.393 --> 01:39:18.295]  So, I mean, he really was involved with Delta Force.
[01:39:18.295 --> 01:39:20.596]  He really was in the Carter administration.
[01:39:20.596 --> 01:39:22.758]  He really was involved with Boykin.
[01:39:22.758 --> 01:39:25.159]  He really, I mean, I know the players.
[01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:26.120]  I mean, I can look up news.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:32.563]  I mean, you can go do a search on Pchenik and like, you know, black ops manipulator, you know, manipulated.
[01:39:33.964 --> 01:39:36.346]  Reds in Italy to kill Prime Minister.
[01:39:36.346 --> 01:39:38.707]  I mean, just all sorts of stuff.
[01:39:38.707 --> 01:39:41.369]  Of course, Pucinich will never talk about any of that on air.
[01:39:41.369 --> 01:39:44.811]  But, I mean, Pucinich really is, you know, really did know Kim Jong Il.
[01:39:44.811 --> 01:39:46.072]  He really did know the father.
[01:39:46.072 --> 01:39:49.854]  He really did go into North Korea last week.
[01:39:49.854 --> 01:39:52.556]  I mean, the guy went into North Korea last week.
[01:39:52.556 --> 01:39:55.117]  I mean, he is a, more than just, he's a spy.
[01:39:55.117 --> 01:39:57.839]  I mean, but he's the old-fashioned, you know, spy.
[01:40:00.018 --> 01:40:03.984]  And I'm not saying he doesn't even have other motives out there, but overall, they don't like what he's doing.
[01:40:03.984 --> 01:40:07.468]  The CFR has been very threatening to him.
[01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:10.472]  He's saying a lot of stuff that's true on the air.
[01:40:10.472 --> 01:40:11.514]  So, there you go.
[01:40:12.995 --> 01:40:35.447]  The reason I asked is because Blair put forth something, and I agree with you, all this stuff about people living on the moon and other planets and stuff, I don't go for that, but he put something that I thought was very plausible, considering the technology that the globalists have, like blue beam, and he stated that he knew that the planes that hit the World Trade Center were actually holographic images
[01:40:36.167 --> 01:40:43.429]  And they were timed from the doomsday plane that was seen flying overhead at the same time when the explosions took place.
[01:40:43.429 --> 01:40:46.649]  I could believe that that actually occurred.
[01:40:46.649 --> 01:40:52.811]  When you look at the video of the planes, it actually kind of looks like they're being absorbed into the buildings rather than flying.
[01:40:52.811 --> 01:40:54.151]  You know, here's the deal.
[01:40:54.151 --> 01:40:58.632]  The media always focuses, and I appreciate your call on that, because that's what they want to debate.
[01:40:59.252 --> 01:41:06.256]  They don't want to debate the Carlisle Group meeting with the Bushes on the morning of 9-11 with the head of the House of Bin Laden.
[01:41:06.256 --> 01:41:07.897]  That's Lundengardian AP.
[01:41:07.897 --> 01:41:10.558]  They don't want to discuss the hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:41:10.558 --> 01:41:11.819]  bases.
[01:41:11.819 --> 01:41:18.843]  AP, Reuters, San Jose Mercury News, the head of the base went public and said, Colonel Butler, said, all I know is these guys are U.S.
[01:41:18.843 --> 01:41:19.943]  agents.
[01:41:19.943 --> 01:41:22.504]  And there's a cover-up, and this is a double-cross.
[01:41:22.504 --> 01:41:26.887]  Did they land an aircraft at a NASA base with different tail numbers?
[01:41:28.755 --> 01:41:32.117]  And then load the people off and then take back off that match the other tail numbers?
[01:41:32.117 --> 01:41:33.338]  Yes.
[01:41:33.338 --> 01:41:35.200]  Does Operation Northwoods talk about that?
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.441]  Yes.
[01:41:36.441 --> 01:41:43.486]  Is Blue Beam real to be able to project a 5,000-foot King Kong or Jesus or whatever they want in the hologram?
[01:41:43.486 --> 01:41:44.006]  Yes.
[01:41:44.006 --> 01:41:45.947]  But I don't think they're going to go operational.
[01:41:45.947 --> 01:41:49.370]  See, I don't think that kids didn't really die at New Haven.
[01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:51.131]  They like killing real kids.
[01:41:51.131 --> 01:41:53.933]  They clearly have some actors there to back up the story as well.
[01:41:53.933 --> 01:41:55.014]  It's a composite.
[01:41:55.014 --> 01:41:56.335]  Part of it's real, part of it isn't.
[01:41:56.335 --> 01:42:00.699]  That's very obvious, and that's what other declassified programs look like.
[01:42:00.699 --> 01:42:01.879]  They're going to kill real kids.
[01:42:01.879 --> 01:42:03.821]  They're going to kill real people.
[01:42:03.821 --> 01:42:08.344]  Now, was it confirmed the towers were more than half empty that day, what they regularly were?
[01:42:08.344 --> 01:42:08.565]  Yes.
[01:42:10.287 --> 01:42:15.170]  Was it confirmed that basically most people got the word not to go to work that day across the board?
[01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:16.211]  Yes.
[01:42:16.211 --> 01:42:21.915]  So the media turns it into no-Jews-died conspiracy theory when they're a bunch of Jews died.
[01:42:22.935 --> 01:42:24.455]  In the World Trade Centers.
[01:42:24.455 --> 01:42:44.321]  See, it comes out, the buildings were half empty, there's all these warnings, it's in local news, yeah, we got warned not to go to work that day, the day before, Mayor Willie Brown comes out, San Francisco Chronicle, I got a call from Condoleezza Rice, told me don't fly to New York tomorrow, uh, I mean, that came out September 12th.
[01:42:44.321 --> 01:42:47.041]  And then he got told to shut up and wouldn't talk about it.
[01:42:47.041 --> 01:42:49.122]  See, nobody wants to, it's said it's like, oh, Jews!
[01:42:50.507 --> 01:42:52.248]  And people go, oh, you're covering up for the Jews.
[01:42:52.248 --> 01:42:52.668]  No, no.
[01:42:52.668 --> 01:43:03.795]  The media, when all this came out about Willie Brown getting warned and all these other people, and Arabs got warned, that got confirmed, and some companies that did have Jews working at them, you know, some Jews got warned.
[01:43:03.795 --> 01:43:06.217]  When all that came out, it was like, oh, Jews!
[01:43:06.217 --> 01:43:09.979]  People say no Jews died to create a false conspiracy theory.
[01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:16.849]  And again, I don't know exactly what happened on 9-11, but the official story is a fraud.
[01:43:16.849 --> 01:43:22.038]  I mean, look at how our government runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria now, and gave them 10,000 heat-seeking missiles.
[01:43:22.038 --> 01:43:22.438]  On record.
[01:43:23.749 --> 01:43:47.445]  And in a year or two years, when European and US or English jet airliners get shot down by the heatseekers, it'll be buried in the back of the news that our government gave them the heatseekers, and I'll be pointing out all the reports we did, all the warnings, and it'll be, yeah, Fox News, yeah, Alex is that piece of garbage, or Glenn Beck will say, that says our government, our firefighters, did 9-11.
[01:43:47.445 --> 01:43:51.567]  That was the talking point a few years ago, was Alex says the fire department was in on it.
[01:43:51.567 --> 01:43:52.308]  I never said that.
[01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:54.891]  Alex says Jews did it.
[01:43:54.891 --> 01:43:56.613]  I never said that.
[01:43:56.613 --> 01:43:59.556]  See, I'm like, hey, they gave him 10,000 heatseekers.
[01:43:59.556 --> 01:44:01.017]  Here's the mainstream articles.
[01:44:01.017 --> 01:44:02.158]  This is terrible.
[01:44:02.158 --> 01:44:03.359]  Remember this when it comes out.
[01:44:03.359 --> 01:44:07.343]  And I'll be here with the mainstream articles when it happens, going, see, I told you it'll be.
[01:44:07.343 --> 01:44:12.888]  Shut up, you un-American piece of garbage.
[01:44:12.888 --> 01:44:14.530]  I mean, I called Colonel Butler up.
[01:44:15.629 --> 01:44:21.552]  Called information, the day the news hit, and I said, I'd like you to come on about how Muhammad Atta trained in your class.
[01:44:21.552 --> 01:44:25.034]  He was the dean of the school, and he goes, I can't talk to you, I'm getting threatened.
[01:44:25.034 --> 01:44:29.556]  And I heard a woman in the background going, I told you, and they told you, what are you doing?
[01:44:29.556 --> 01:44:31.357]  Click.
[01:44:31.357 --> 01:44:33.478]  Because they began the court martial of him the next day.
[01:44:33.478 --> 01:44:37.040]  They probably had men in suits in their house right then.
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:40.922]  Imagine the colonel, the head of the base is like, five of the hijackers trained.
[01:44:40.922 --> 01:44:43.784]  Atta was in my class, front row, for a year.
[01:44:45.262 --> 01:44:46.023]  Something's going on!
[01:44:46.023 --> 01:44:47.103]  The government's involved!
[01:44:47.103 --> 01:44:49.345]  We gotta warn people!
[01:44:49.345 --> 01:44:52.046]  And I'll bet you bottom dollar, we gotta go try to find Butler.
[01:44:52.046 --> 01:44:53.167]  That's the kind of stuff that gets you killed.
[01:44:53.167 --> 01:44:56.549]  Because of the credibility of that.
[01:44:56.549 --> 01:44:58.971]  And by the way, San Jose Mercury News wasn't controlled.
[01:44:58.971 --> 01:45:01.072]  They reported it right after it happened.
[01:45:01.072 --> 01:45:02.513]  It was like September 15th or something.
[01:45:02.513 --> 01:45:06.095]  They wrote a letter to the editor.
[01:45:06.095 --> 01:45:06.875]  The head of the U.S.
[01:45:06.875 --> 01:45:09.197]  Embassy in Visa Section, Springman,
[01:45:10.782 --> 01:45:18.664]  Tells the Toronto Star, he goes, all I know is we were told give them visas because the CIA was really controlling them and they weren't really Al Qaeda.
[01:45:19.747 --> 01:45:22.308]  See, you bring up these points and I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:45:22.308 --> 01:45:23.589]  It's so crazy.
[01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:26.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, crime syndicates.
[01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:28.351]  The New World Order is a global banking mafia.
[01:45:28.351 --> 01:45:29.351]  They are a mafia.
[01:45:29.351 --> 01:45:31.152]  They have private hitmen.
[01:45:31.152 --> 01:45:33.653]  These banks are bigger than most countries' GDP.
[01:45:33.653 --> 01:45:34.733]  They have their own armies.
[01:45:34.733 --> 01:45:36.874]  They run the private intelligence networks.
[01:45:36.874 --> 01:45:38.435]  They can listen to your phones.
[01:45:38.435 --> 01:45:44.117]  They've got 800,000 private contractors with subcontractor companies of the big banks that listen to your phones.
[01:45:44.117 --> 01:45:45.798]  They administer the welfare checks.
[01:45:45.798 --> 01:45:46.519]  They run it all.
[01:45:46.519 --> 01:45:47.219]  They're the government.
[01:45:48.221 --> 01:45:53.543]  They're dissolving the old government, having a new privatized government, not privatized for bids.
[01:45:53.543 --> 01:45:57.704]  These are no-bid privatized.
[01:45:57.704 --> 01:46:04.746]  And they are telling the police and military, prepare to arrest Christians en masse.
[01:46:04.746 --> 01:46:07.486]  That broke last week, mainstream news.
[01:46:07.486 --> 01:46:12.928]  And finally, the normalcy bias of the state police and sheriffs in Colorado are like,
[01:46:14.439 --> 01:46:21.746]  You're teaching us that Christians are terrorists and we're going to have to arrest them en masse and there's going to be a Christian uprising?
[01:46:21.746 --> 01:46:24.488]  That sounds like Russia or something.
[01:46:24.488 --> 01:46:25.048]  What is it?
[01:46:25.048 --> 01:46:33.155]  We better... Yeah, you better get up off your butts, folks!
[01:46:33.155 --> 01:46:36.358]  The spirit of evil is moving across the country right now.
[01:46:38.196 --> 01:46:39.517]  Yeah, that's Fox News, guys.
[01:46:39.517 --> 01:46:43.679]  Pull up the one from Infowars that links to the newspapers in Colorado.
[01:46:43.679 --> 01:46:50.622]  The headline was State Police, you know, trained to confiscate guns from Christians.
[01:46:50.622 --> 01:46:55.365]  That's got the letters from the state police and others just freaking out going, what planet do we live on?
[01:46:55.365 --> 01:46:59.767]  Well, I'll tell you, you live in authoritarianism.
[01:46:59.767 --> 01:47:01.528]  And again, I'm freaking out.
[01:47:01.528 --> 01:47:03.429]  I'm not even having an anxiety attack right now.
[01:47:04.648 --> 01:47:07.710]  I just feel like I shouldn't even, in a weird way, even be on air.
[01:47:07.710 --> 01:47:10.272]  I mean, I just can't even believe this anymore.
[01:47:10.272 --> 01:47:18.037]  That illegal aliens are allowed to drink and drive and kill people, and there it is, DHS funded, coarse-ass cops so they will confiscate guns from Christians.
[01:47:18.037 --> 01:47:21.619]  Colorado troopers trained to consider Christians as dangerous terrorists.
[01:47:21.619 --> 01:47:23.860]  I mean, now, that came out on April 10th last week.
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:25.161]  Print that for me, thanks.
[01:47:25.161 --> 01:47:27.403]  And it just comes out and it's like, oh yeah!
[01:47:27.403 --> 01:47:31.105]  And it's got the letters from the state police and people going, yeah, this is really creepy.
[01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:38.992]  God help me.
[01:47:38.992 --> 01:47:43.135]  And I'm telling you, the enemy's gonna come after us however they can.
[01:47:43.135 --> 01:47:47.479]  It's by the grace of God, your prayers were even on the air right now.
[01:47:47.479 --> 01:47:55.026]  I mean, I just hope you know, folks, I am directly at the gate of the Dragon's Den with a sword, stabbing him in the belly right now, okay?
[01:47:55.026 --> 01:47:57.368]  And I'm little and I'm weak, but the idea is powerful.
[01:47:58.357 --> 01:48:01.579]  And I just, my, my flesh isn't even afraid.
[01:48:01.579 --> 01:48:05.742]  It's more like, uh, I mean, I can't even believe we're in this situation.
[01:48:05.742 --> 01:48:12.147]  I can't believe everybody else is just going around like it's normal.
[01:48:12.147 --> 01:48:17.210]  Every instinct I've got is just get my family and get the hell out of here right now.
[01:48:17.210 --> 01:48:19.852]  But I'm telling you folks, that way is destruction.
[01:48:19.852 --> 01:48:22.754]  We've gotten in this position by, oh, I'm not going to say anything.
[01:48:22.754 --> 01:48:23.815]  What will my neighbors think?
[01:48:23.815 --> 01:48:24.996]  Oh, I'm not going to get involved.
[01:48:27.865 --> 01:48:29.848]  Uh, let's talk to David in Pennsylvania.
[01:48:29.848 --> 01:48:30.648]  Thanks for holding, David.
[01:48:30.648 --> 01:48:32.731]  Then we'll go to Danny, Ramone, William, and others.
[01:48:32.731 --> 01:48:33.652]  You're on the air, David.
[01:48:33.652 --> 01:48:35.114]  Welcome.
[01:48:35.114 --> 01:48:35.594]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:35.594 --> 01:48:36.676]  How are you?
[01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:38.698]  I just am watching the fall of America.
[01:48:38.698 --> 01:48:40.120]  It's like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:48:41.181 --> 01:48:42.303]  I hear you, I hear you.
[01:48:42.303 --> 01:48:52.334]  I started listening to you three years ago, and when I started telling my neighbors and people about what you said, you know, they would think I was crazy, a lunatic.
[01:48:52.334 --> 01:48:59.042]  But what's strange is a lot of people agree now, but nobody seems to want to do anything.
[01:48:59.042 --> 01:49:00.824]  I mean, I called my senator.
[01:49:02.084 --> 01:49:08.707]  And I even called Martinez down there when I saw that video on your website.
[01:49:08.707 --> 01:49:09.827]  But what do we do?
[01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:19.731]  Thank you so much!
[01:49:46.171 --> 01:49:49.334]  I've got a proclamation on behalf of the Mayor and City Council that we want to present.
[01:49:49.334 --> 01:49:52.957]  I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[01:49:52.957 --> 01:49:59.702]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[01:49:59.702 --> 01:50:06.708]  But, because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your sign legitimate shortly.
[01:50:06.708 --> 01:50:11.452]  So you hang on to that.
[01:50:11.452 --> 01:50:15.215]  And again they cheer, and while this is happening, a woman comes up and hits him
[01:50:17.847 --> 01:50:26.811]  With her, not a complete fist, she had like, you know, her knuckles, it's almost like how a monkey hits people, a chimpanzee.
[01:50:26.811 --> 01:50:36.715]  She throws her hand out and hits him with the middle of her fingers, and you can tell he pops them, and she pops them pretty hard and he turns around, and then another guy runs in, they're like roaches.
[01:50:36.715 --> 01:50:39.896]  I mean, Martina says that, you want some attention, buddy?
[01:50:39.896 --> 01:50:41.317]  And they just run in like roaches.
[01:50:42.242 --> 01:50:43.203]  I'm going to come back to you, caller.
[01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:44.163]  I'm going to come back.
[01:50:44.163 --> 01:50:44.804]  Don't hang up, David.
[01:50:44.804 --> 01:50:46.485]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:50:46.485 --> 01:50:49.046]  And again, it's just, there's such flaming authoritarians.
[01:50:49.046 --> 01:50:54.049]  And Martinez, if you don't see the video as a radio listener, it's on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:54.049 --> 01:50:56.630]  There's this craziness.
[01:50:56.630 --> 01:51:00.653]  We'll get your guns because he sees us as his food, as his property.

[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:01.641]  Breaking news!
[01:52:01.641 --> 01:52:09.384]  Harry Reid and the Democrats in the Senate are getting ready to pass a sweeping new gun control bill that will take away your constitutional right to keep and bear arms.
[01:52:09.384 --> 01:52:19.910]  Conservatives in the Senate, led by Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Marco Rubio, have promised to do everything they can to keep this dangerous bill from becoming law, even if they have to filibuster it day and night.
[01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:23.332]  These principled leaders refuse to compromise with President Obama.
[01:52:23.332 --> 01:52:27.894]  They have committed to fight the gun-grabbing liberals in the Senate, but they need your help to succeed.
[01:52:28.194 --> 01:52:30.056]  You can support them by calling today.
[01:52:30.056 --> 01:52:37.843]  Please call 1-800-996-4229 and sign the official Senate Conservatives petition to pledge your support for the Second Amendment.
[01:52:37.843 --> 01:52:39.304]  This could be your last chance.
[01:52:39.304 --> 01:52:47.792]  So please call 1-800-996-4229 to support Senators Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Marco Rubio in the fight for our freedoms.
[01:52:48.072 --> 01:52:51.213]  Please call 1-800-996-4229.
[01:52:51.213 --> 01:52:52.454]  Today, that's 1-800-996-4229.

[01:53:01.338 --> 01:53:07.161]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:53:08.084 --> 01:53:14.851]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[01:53:29.925 --> 01:53:36.869]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:53:36.869 --> 01:53:47.255]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:53:56.877 --> 01:53:59.780]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:54:08.121 --> 01:54:13.584]  Alright, Richard Belzer, who's got a new book out that I just finished that we also sell at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:13.584 --> 01:54:19.768]  Hit list, an in-depth investigation into the mysterious deaths of witnesses to the JFK assassination.
[01:54:19.768 --> 01:54:21.969]  This is the most compelling evidence.
[01:54:21.969 --> 01:54:27.693]  Because you can make up stuff about magic bullets and stuff with ignorant people, but what about all the people that were murdered?
[01:54:28.553 --> 01:54:30.334]  It's hundreds of them.
[01:54:30.334 --> 01:54:33.776]  More than 50 where it's just incredibly obvious.
[01:54:33.776 --> 01:54:40.421]  I mean, within weeks, murdered to keep the official story floating for a while.
[01:54:40.421 --> 01:54:44.403]  So that's going to be coming up in about the eight after.
[01:54:44.403 --> 01:54:46.204]  We're going to take calls right now.
[01:54:46.204 --> 01:54:47.145]  David, finish your point.
[01:54:47.145 --> 01:54:47.605]  I'm sorry.
[01:54:47.605 --> 01:54:48.106]  We went to that.
[01:54:48.826 --> 01:54:56.750]  Uh, clip of the gun grabbers saying, after we're registered, you know, the work they're doing now, that you'll need your sign, don't ban the guns, so keep that sign, you're gonna need that.
[01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:58.091]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:54:58.091 --> 01:55:01.153]  I mean, it's just incredible how disingenuous most of them are.
[01:55:01.153 --> 01:55:05.295]  At least he was honest about the fact that he'll have armed guards, but you won't.
[01:55:05.295 --> 01:55:08.017]  That's, that's how, that's how they roll.
[01:55:08.017 --> 01:55:10.178]  But go ahead, David, make your point from Pennsylvania.
[01:55:11.192 --> 01:55:17.539]  Well, the point I was trying to make is since they always turn it around on us, I mean, how do we ultimately win?
[01:55:17.539 --> 01:55:27.391]  I mean, we keep talking and talking, and I agree with you, the one who takes the first shot loses, but at the end, how do we turn this around?
[01:55:28.854 --> 01:55:31.875]  Well, number one, they're going to stage stuff and say we took the first shot.
[01:55:31.875 --> 01:55:34.576]  They'll find a federal building with a daycare again and blow it up.
[01:55:34.576 --> 01:55:36.917]  There's no doubt that was a federal operation.
[01:55:36.917 --> 01:55:40.058]  I'm in the film, and I endorse it.
[01:55:40.058 --> 01:55:40.858]  Very powerful.
[01:55:40.858 --> 01:55:48.160]  It's got police officers that were witnesses of the government operation who were death-threatened living cops, not the cops they were able to kill, like Terrence Yakey.
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.301]  They got Mr. Browning, Don Browning, and others in there.
[01:55:51.501 --> 01:55:59.006]  I imagine the head of the K-9 unit, a Marine veteran of Vietnam, and he's told, we're going to kill you and your wife if you don't shut up about what you saw, boy.
[01:55:59.006 --> 01:56:01.127]  One of the first guys to show up.
[01:56:01.127 --> 01:56:03.068]  How's that sound?
[01:56:03.068 --> 01:56:05.129]  I mean, you're right, we blew that up, buddy.
[01:56:05.129 --> 01:56:06.950]  Now you keep your mouth shut or you're dead.
[01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:12.913]  And by the way, when I got him to talk about that first on the radio and then in that film, he was gulping on air when he did it.
[01:56:12.913 --> 01:56:16.635]  Because, you know, even a combat veteran is like, okay.
[01:56:16.635 --> 01:56:19.057]  Because he cares about the truth and those kids they killed.
[01:56:19.724 --> 01:56:21.444]  You think it's fun doing this, folks?
[01:56:21.444 --> 01:56:22.685]  You think it's fun?
[01:56:22.685 --> 01:56:28.406]  All the egomaniacs and narcissists out there that think they're patriots, who all they do is infight and stuff all day?
[01:56:28.406 --> 01:56:31.587]  This is a life and death situation.
[01:56:31.587 --> 01:56:32.987]  This isn't a game.
[01:56:32.987 --> 01:56:36.568]  And they're going to fire first by blowing stuff up and saying we did it.
[01:56:36.568 --> 01:56:39.649]  That's why we've got to expose who really does the fault fast and furious.
[01:56:39.909 --> 01:56:43.412]  And of course they did Aurora, and of course they're up to their eyeballs.
[01:56:43.412 --> 01:56:54.802]  I mean, shooters in the same outfit from nearby hostage team, SWAT teams from a nearby federal special unit, local police who were federal special event police, caught in the woods.
[01:56:54.802 --> 01:56:59.626]  It wasn't just one, it wasn't just two, there were three of them seen, one of them arrested!
[01:56:59.626 --> 01:57:05.852]  And then they tried to cover it up and say it didn't exist, even though it was confirmed in the police reports and we have chopper video!
[01:57:06.952 --> 01:57:07.452]  Okay?
[01:57:07.452 --> 01:57:09.494]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks!
[01:57:09.494 --> 01:57:10.975]  They grief little kids!
[01:57:10.975 --> 01:57:11.376]  Boom!
[01:57:11.376 --> 01:57:12.576]  Right in the head!
[01:57:12.576 --> 01:57:13.477]  To get our guns.
[01:57:13.477 --> 01:57:14.618]  Isn't it obvious?
[01:57:14.618 --> 01:57:15.239]  I'm sorry, sir.
[01:57:15.239 --> 01:57:17.180]  Go ahead.
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:17.881]  You're right.
[01:57:17.881 --> 01:57:19.182]  It's unbelievable.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.602]  I'll stand with you, Terry, and my friends.
[01:57:22.602 --> 01:57:22.982]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:22.982 --> 01:57:23.303]  Thank you.
[01:57:49.653 --> 01:57:57.338]  And you talk about how the FBI came to your office and said you and your wife would be killed if you didn't shut up.
[01:57:57.338 --> 01:58:01.001]  And he tells the story and I go, okay, go ahead and tell me the names.
[01:58:01.001 --> 01:58:01.341]  Listen!
[01:58:02.725 --> 01:58:04.988]  There is a God, and I'm in God's hands.
[01:58:04.988 --> 01:58:05.748]  You understand that?
[01:58:05.748 --> 01:58:08.091]  And that's why everyone marvels at this show.
[01:58:08.091 --> 01:58:09.893]  No one can believe we're on the air.
[01:58:09.893 --> 01:58:11.575]  No one can believe this is happening.
[01:58:11.575 --> 01:58:12.976]  How could Alex be real?
[01:58:12.976 --> 01:58:15.439]  Because, you know, it's impossible.
[01:58:15.439 --> 01:58:18.322]  Because people can't handle their own fear.
[01:58:18.322 --> 01:58:20.505]  Other media people can't handle their own fear.
[01:58:22.284 --> 01:58:22.684]  You understand?
[01:58:22.684 --> 01:58:23.684]  They can't imagine.
[01:58:23.684 --> 01:58:24.805]  There are good police.
[01:58:24.805 --> 01:58:25.965]  There are good military.
[01:58:25.965 --> 01:58:28.086]  There are good people in media.
[01:58:28.086 --> 01:58:34.187]  And it shows there's still good people in America that we're on over 150 AM and FM affiliates.
[01:58:34.187 --> 01:58:34.527]  Okay?
[01:58:34.527 --> 01:58:38.729]  We can turn the tides, folks, but this is the most hardcore tyranny the world's ever seen.
[01:58:38.729 --> 01:58:41.529]  We've got to fight it.
[01:58:41.529 --> 01:58:42.930]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.996 --> 01:58:58.219]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:58:58.219 --> 01:59:16.088]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:59:16.088 --> 01:59:20.210]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:59:20.490 --> 01:59:22.251]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:59:22.251 --> 01:59:30.437]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:00:05.719 --> 02:00:07.019]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.019 --> 02:00:08.801]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:10.541]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.541 --> 02:00:12.122]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.122 --> 02:00:12.903]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:17.848 --> 02:00:31.292]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.292 --> 02:00:36.554]  Alright, let's continue with your phone calls and also get to you with Richard Belzer coming up.
[02:00:36.554 --> 02:00:38.554]  If we give in to the bullies, they're going to take everything.
[02:00:38.554 --> 02:00:40.035]  The only chance is fighting back.
[02:00:40.035 --> 02:00:40.915]  Have you figured that out yet?
[02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:47.318]  That's why they're going after whistleblowers everywhere, because that can bring them down.
[02:00:47.318 --> 02:00:48.900]  Let's talk to Danny in Tennessee.
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:49.862]  You're on the air, Danny.
[02:00:49.862 --> 02:00:50.182]  Welcome.
[02:00:52.042 --> 02:00:53.102]  Can you hear me okay, Alex?
[02:00:53.102 --> 02:00:54.543]  Yes, Danny.
[02:00:54.543 --> 02:00:55.804]  Hey, brother man.
[02:00:55.804 --> 02:01:13.171]  Now, I was wanting to talk to you about what Billy Corgan had suggested to you, which you already have done it, but he was talking to you about that you need to get in touch with people that had ancestors that had been able to survive for the past few thousand years, about like the Native Americans.
[02:01:13.991 --> 02:01:15.612]  Yes, some of my ancestors were from Scotland.
[02:01:15.612 --> 02:01:16.253]  They were Jacobites.
[02:01:16.253 --> 02:01:18.234]  I don't know if you know what that is.
[02:01:34.918 --> 02:01:39.999]  Okay, well what I was going to say was, you had already done all this stuff with Russell Means.
[02:01:39.999 --> 02:01:46.621]  You had already had the documentary that you had with Welcome to the Reservation and all that.
[02:01:46.621 --> 02:01:49.262]  You had John Trudell on before.
[02:01:49.262 --> 02:01:56.184]  But what I was going to suggest to you was, Alex, was just like what you were saying right before the break, where it was kind of like a spiritual
[02:01:56.977 --> 02:02:00.780]  You're saying like spiritually, you know, it's like real heavy.
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:01.601]  I mean, that's it.
[02:02:01.601 --> 02:02:07.707]  I can feel, not just see it manifesting, evil, like rushing out and like possessing people almost.
[02:02:07.707 --> 02:02:15.093]  People are getting crazier, meaner, more backstabbing, more like delusional, where people make up whatever they want to believe.
[02:02:15.093 --> 02:02:17.855]  I mean, it's just, I mean, it freaks me out.
[02:02:17.855 --> 02:02:19.357]  I see it on the highways.
[02:02:19.357 --> 02:02:22.139]  I'm sure everybody I talk to is seeing it.
[02:02:22.139 --> 02:02:22.800]  Are you seeing that?
[02:02:24.541 --> 02:02:26.042]  Definitely Alex, definitely.
[02:02:26.042 --> 02:02:34.946]  But what I was going to say was when you were talking to Billy, you were talking about going up to that next mountain top and how you're kind of like screaming into the side of the mountain right now with your broadcast.
[02:02:34.946 --> 02:02:38.347]  Not a lot of people are awake and can understand and hear.
[02:02:38.347 --> 02:02:39.268]  But if you recall,
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:46.766]  Back to that first interview with Russell Means, and anyone that's listening right now, you can go to Alex Jones' YouTube channel and listen to this.
[02:02:46.766 --> 02:02:48.667]  He has a playlist with Russell Means.
[02:02:48.667 --> 02:02:52.851]  Alex, do you remember, like, how awesome that first interview was with Russell Means?
[02:02:52.851 --> 02:02:54.152]  Like, how much y'all had in common?
[02:02:54.152 --> 02:02:54.993]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[02:02:54.993 --> 02:02:59.437]  How the whole left-hand rider controlled, how it's what Obama was going to do, it's like four years ago.
[02:03:00.457 --> 02:03:02.178]  Uh, and, uh, absolutely.
[02:03:02.178 --> 02:03:05.120]  People say, Russell Means, he's the big anti, you know, whatever.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:10.202]  He's the guy that really grew a lot of courage with the big sieges at Wounded Knee, the rest of it.
[02:03:10.202 --> 02:03:16.565]  He was demonized by the Native American groups because they were COINTELPRO and jealous of him, basically.
[02:03:16.565 --> 02:03:20.207]  And I mean, nobody's perfect, but I mean, I've talked a lot with Russell Means on and off the air.
[02:03:20.207 --> 02:03:23.229]  We went to the Dakotas to interview him, and he was the real deal.
[02:03:24.189 --> 02:03:26.630]  And he's dead now, but his information lives on.
[02:03:26.630 --> 02:03:37.053]  And he grew a lot, and became a constitutionalist and a libertarian, and really transcended, you know, kind of the fake lefticism.
[02:03:37.053 --> 02:03:40.334]  But that's why they tried to cover all that up and assassinate his name.
[02:03:40.934 --> 02:03:51.656]  And if they kill me, folks, that's the first thing they'll do, is either try to assassinate my character first, then kill me, or imprison me, or kill me and then assassinate my character.
[02:03:51.656 --> 02:03:55.017]  Because, you know, money, you can get people to say anything you want.
[02:03:55.017 --> 02:04:05.199]  And it doesn't matter, just remember, you're good, you know what's good, you know the truth, you are a good person, stand up and fight tyranny, don't let them trick you into infighting.
[02:04:05.199 --> 02:04:08.080]  And I just, God has hit me, talk about being convicted.
[02:04:09.081 --> 02:04:15.669]  Because I've always, you know, taken the high road with stuff, but sometimes I get a little nasty, like with Glenn Beck and stuff and other things.
[02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:17.792]  I have just decided, and have totally been convicted,
[02:04:20.053 --> 02:04:41.459]  And for people that don't know, that means like by God, not like convicted of a crime, that I need to just absolutely turn it all loose and also redouble my efforts, but also just completely trust in God and transcend all of the narcissism, all of the ego, all of it, because we need to all realize how real all this is.
[02:04:41.459 --> 02:04:47.281]  I mean, this is so real, folks, and we're, as bad as things are, we're on the edge of just a cauldron.
[02:04:48.122 --> 02:04:55.615]  of psychopaths and sociopaths and control freaks and weirdos that want to run rampant in society.
[02:04:55.615 --> 02:04:57.379]  We'll be right back with more calls on our guest.
[02:04:57.379 --> 02:04:57.840]  Stay with us.

[02:06:10.232 --> 02:06:12.694]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.694 --> 02:06:18.399]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:18.399 --> 02:06:24.644]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:25.064 --> 02:06:31.007]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:31.007 --> 02:06:35.229]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:06:35.229 --> 02:06:39.511]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:39.511 --> 02:06:45.454]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.454 --> 02:06:49.016]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:49.016 --> 02:06:50.977]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.977 --> 02:06:51.417]  It's here.

[02:08:13.450 --> 02:08:19.482]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:28.516 --> 02:08:32.460]  Well, he's been in scores of different TV shows and movies.
[02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:36.623]  Probably best known for Law & Order, Special Victims Unit, Richard Belzer.
[02:08:36.623 --> 02:08:38.805]  And I like getting him on because he's a funny guy.
[02:08:38.805 --> 02:08:43.610]  Plus, you know, who else shows up to the show with Christopher Walken before?
[02:08:43.610 --> 02:08:48.034]  It's like, here's Christopher Walken, and then he sits down right next to him off the chart.
[02:08:48.034 --> 02:08:51.017]  But Walken just wanted to talk about recipes, chicken recipes.
[02:08:52.965 --> 02:08:58.249]  And we're carrying his new book, which I think is one of the best JFK books out there.
[02:08:58.249 --> 02:08:59.170]  It just came out.
[02:08:59.170 --> 02:09:01.471]  It's available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:09:01.471 --> 02:09:14.700]  But the reason I think it's important is I've told people if we make a JFK film, which I've been doing for eight years with footage, you kind of get obsessed with it when you work on it and then never put out the final product because there's just so many things to cover, so much proof.
[02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:17.542]  You know, debunking the debunkers, it's ridiculous.
[02:09:17.542 --> 02:09:21.145]  But the biggest smoking gun is the hundreds of people
[02:09:22.190 --> 02:09:27.692]  Murdered, tortured, killed, you name it, who were witnesses or were connected to the JFK assassination.
[02:09:27.692 --> 02:09:29.953]  That's the real proof.
[02:09:29.953 --> 02:09:32.194]  You see, it's like the gun control thing.
[02:09:32.194 --> 02:09:35.875]  You can hear the argument for background checks, the argument for mentally ill people.
[02:09:35.875 --> 02:09:38.176]  The problem is the government wants the guns to control us.
[02:09:38.176 --> 02:09:40.257]  They're buying millions of rounds of ammo.
[02:09:40.257 --> 02:09:41.878]  They're buying armored vehicles.
[02:09:41.878 --> 02:09:43.338]  That's the issue.
[02:09:43.338 --> 02:09:47.240]  You know, Dianne Feinstein laughs and says, yeah, of course I'm going to take the guns after we register them.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:50.561]  You know, Mike Martinez in Austin, the city council says, yeah, we're going to register them and confiscate.
[02:09:51.226 --> 02:09:53.068]  You go out and talk to Californians on the street.
[02:09:53.068 --> 02:09:54.250]  We've got the video.
[02:09:54.250 --> 02:09:56.272]  It's up at Infowars.com right now.
[02:09:56.272 --> 02:09:59.516]  They say, yeah, we need to arrest gun owners.
[02:09:59.516 --> 02:10:03.681]  I mean, it's just this demonization like, we killed the kids at Sandy Hook.
[02:10:03.681 --> 02:10:08.787]  My whole point is, if you have a military-industrial complex, the Second Amendment is the check and the balance on that.
[02:10:10.185 --> 02:10:14.612]  That's my point, and I get, you know, real liberals who are like anti-war.
[02:10:14.612 --> 02:10:16.295]  I get not wanting to kill things.
[02:10:16.295 --> 02:10:20.983]  I even used to be a big hunter, and I think if you butcher it and actually eat it, it's good, but I don't just like to kill things.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.503]  But I also think it's more humane to go get a hamburger you just eat and then criticize somebody who actually goes out and butchers the cow themselves.
[02:10:28.503 --> 02:10:35.146]  They tried to shut down Discovery Channel shows where it shows like Amish and people, you know, that actually raise their own cattle and butcher them and everything.
[02:10:35.146 --> 02:10:37.507]  It's like, that's so mean, they killed the cow.
[02:10:37.507 --> 02:10:41.189]  Well, it's ten times more humane than how they kill them at slaughterhouses.
[02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:42.270]  My point is, is that
[02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:45.414]  People say, oh, you're liberal, you're anti-GMO.
[02:10:45.414 --> 02:10:46.095]  No.
[02:10:46.095 --> 02:10:53.105]  All the major GMO crops that are cross-species and grow their own pesticide absolutely kill the rodents it's fed to.
[02:10:53.105 --> 02:10:54.387]  And you look at what's happening to us.
[02:10:54.387 --> 02:10:55.688]  I'm pro-common sense.
[02:10:57.469 --> 02:11:02.153]  I didn't get Belzer on about gun stuff because I know he's in the middle of the road on that.
[02:11:02.153 --> 02:11:06.558]  It's just all this stuff's happening up at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now.
[02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:09.460]  Californians signed a petition to ban and confiscate firearms.
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:14.225]  I keep harping on that because people need to know they're going to take all the guns they have everywhere else.
[02:11:14.225 --> 02:11:15.146]  Let's be honest about it.
[02:11:15.626 --> 02:11:19.511]  Obama supporters signed petition to ban free speech.
[02:11:19.511 --> 02:11:22.455]  A new article out with video of that happening.
[02:11:22.455 --> 02:11:25.799]  Obama supporters signed petition to ban free speech.
[02:11:25.799 --> 02:11:31.066]  Illegal immigrant DUI killer ruled incompetent because his unique cultural background.
[02:11:31.807 --> 02:11:36.630]  Republicans support gun bill as Senator warns of loopholes.
[02:11:36.630 --> 02:11:40.672]  U.S.-backed FAS rebels decapitate and grill victim.
[02:11:40.672 --> 02:11:41.753]  I'm not kidding, the U.N.
[02:11:41.753 --> 02:11:42.893]  always does that, too.
[02:11:42.893 --> 02:11:43.674]  Type in U.N.
[02:11:43.674 --> 02:11:46.075]  grilling children, you'll get the photos in newspapers.
[02:11:46.075 --> 02:11:47.576]  I'm not joking.
[02:11:47.576 --> 02:11:50.938]  Hacked photos show Colin Powell at Bohemian Grove.
[02:11:50.938 --> 02:11:53.499]  Big sis coordinating gun confiscations.
[02:11:53.499 --> 02:11:54.860]  That's confirmed.
[02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:56.741]  She's the one ordering the persecution of the vets.
[02:11:56.741 --> 02:12:00.163]  I mean, like they're Jews in Nazi Germany, folks, when they go after a group,
[02:12:00.919 --> 02:12:01.999]  You know you're in danger.
[02:12:01.999 --> 02:12:11.681]  I'm going to get into all of that with Belzer and I promise William and Ramon and Chad and Nick and Brendan, all of you are holding, but he can talk about any subject.
[02:12:11.681 --> 02:12:14.142]  We're going to talk JFK for the first 20 minutes or so.
[02:12:14.142 --> 02:12:23.744]  Hit list, an in-depth investigation into the mysterious deaths of witnesses to the JFK assassination, available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:12:23.744 --> 02:12:25.264]  It's just coming out.
[02:12:25.264 --> 02:12:27.585]  His last book on JFK became a New York Times bestseller.
[02:12:28.445 --> 02:12:30.488]  It isn't about even the money with this.
[02:12:30.488 --> 02:12:34.112]  I mean, obviously buying it from us funds our operation, but books are a very small part of it.
[02:12:34.112 --> 02:12:36.595]  It's about having a tool to wake people up.
[02:12:36.595 --> 02:12:39.758]  And again, this is my pet project.
[02:12:39.758 --> 02:12:43.202]  I didn't even tell Belzer this.
[02:12:43.202 --> 02:12:48.608]  I think, and I've told people privately and on air, that I believe the murders of the witnesses is the key.
[02:12:49.449 --> 02:12:58.113]  And, you know, a lot of JFK researchers also know that, but this book is extremely hard-hitting and extremely well-documented.
[02:12:58.113 --> 02:13:17.221]  It's my favorite type of read, with, like, factoid data pages every other page, neurotically demonizing, showing what the globalists are doing, how they demonized people that spoke out, how they killed them, just neurotically documenting everything, the people that were killed.
[02:13:18.274 --> 02:13:18.715]  All of it.
[02:13:18.715 --> 02:13:20.497]  So they also assassinated people's character.
[02:13:20.497 --> 02:13:22.479]  They didn't just kill people physically.
[02:13:22.479 --> 02:13:31.631]  And so joining us to talk about Richard Belzer with David Wayne, Hit List, an in-depth investigation into the mysterious deaths of witnesses to the JFK assassination.
[02:13:31.631 --> 02:13:33.934]  He joins us now via video Skype.
[02:13:33.934 --> 02:13:35.656]  And good to have you back on with us, Richard.
[02:13:36.221 --> 02:13:37.883]  Alex, I miss you.
[02:13:37.883 --> 02:13:40.325]  I haven't spoken to you in a long time.
[02:13:40.325 --> 02:13:53.136]  I must say that your programming, your documentaries, your news shows, those interviews have helped me in my research and I greatly appreciate it.
[02:13:53.136 --> 02:14:00.943]  And I want you to always take care of yourself and stay safe, my friend, because we're, as you say, we're trading in some dangerous waters now because
[02:14:01.804 --> 02:14:08.390]  Uh, a former FBI agent who I interviewed, I won't name him, but he said, I have no theories, I just have facts.
[02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:16.336]  And that's why, um, I'm so proud of the last two books I did, because I used to be a journalist, I've written novels and, you know, I'm a comedian, I'm an actor.
[02:14:17.077 --> 02:14:23.283]  I'm obsessed with the recent history of our country, at least since World War I, and what has happened.
[02:14:23.283 --> 02:14:26.145]  And I just want to read one quick thing, if I may, Alex.
[02:14:26.145 --> 02:14:35.253]  History will not absolve us if we do not, once and for all, reveal all that is known about the greatest, most tragic murder mystery in American history.
[02:14:35.253 --> 02:14:40.217]  After all, 90% of the American people believe that there was a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy.
[02:14:40.217 --> 02:14:42.579]  The other 10% work for the government or the media.
[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:46.262]  This book is dedicated to the 90%.
[02:14:46.262 --> 02:14:55.468]  May you forever question, hold accountable, and improve the great gift from our forebearers, what historians have called our experiment in democracy.
[02:14:55.468 --> 02:15:00.431]  Let us all join in this quest to preserve the very soul of our nation.
[02:15:00.431 --> 02:15:07.656]  And I think, Alex, you are in this small brigade, I hope it's getting bigger, of just, I know you don't make anything up.
[02:15:07.656 --> 02:15:08.596]  It's the truth.
[02:15:08.596 --> 02:15:10.638]  You know, that's why I don't write fiction anymore.
[02:15:11.957 --> 02:15:13.518]  Well, Richard, it's great having you with us.
[02:15:13.518 --> 02:15:22.561]  And when I talk about the fact that this is dangerous, it's still dangerous for JFK investigators.
[02:15:22.561 --> 02:15:25.822]  And it's dangerous for journalists that talk to whistleblowers.
[02:15:25.822 --> 02:15:29.864]  They're now arresting journalists, as you know, at record levels.
[02:15:29.864 --> 02:15:32.085]  Government people that report crimes are being arrested.
[02:15:33.355 --> 02:15:45.631]  Yeah, there's a documentary coming out, I think this week, Alex, about Obama and how he is going after whistleblowers in a really astounding way.
[02:15:45.631 --> 02:15:50.196]  And boy, you know, this administration is really getting to...
[02:15:50.737 --> 02:15:51.918]  You know, scary.
[02:15:51.918 --> 02:15:54.719]  You know, I remember the unicorns and the rainbows when he came in.
[02:15:54.719 --> 02:15:58.922]  I'm, you know, I'm glad that we, you know, elected a mixed race person.
[02:15:58.922 --> 02:16:01.803]  But, you know, he brought in all the bad bankers.
[02:16:01.803 --> 02:16:07.727]  You know, I wrote a piece in Huffington Post six years ago called, It's the Banks, Stupid.
[02:16:08.607 --> 02:16:10.689]  And I talked about reverse bank robbery.
[02:16:10.689 --> 02:16:11.510]  They're robbing us.
[02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:12.350]  We're not robbing them.
[02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:15.093]  You know, in the old days, Dillinger, during the Depression, would rob a bank.
[02:16:15.093 --> 02:16:16.254]  He was a hero.
[02:16:16.254 --> 02:16:17.875]  Now they rob us.
[02:16:17.875 --> 02:16:20.397]  And you're right to keep going back to the banks, Alex.
[02:16:20.397 --> 02:16:22.919]  And I want to tell you something that was pretty chilling today.
[02:16:22.919 --> 02:16:32.267]  I was listening to your show online, and someone was talking about you're getting into the banks, and all of a sudden, beep, beep, beep, beep!
[02:16:32.267 --> 02:16:33.768]  This station is not available.
[02:16:33.768 --> 02:16:34.549]  Try again later.
[02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:35.610]  Now, you know,
[02:16:37.461 --> 02:16:47.008]  People call me paranoid, but... And then, for the last few days, my computer, the cursor, is going to places by itself.
[02:16:47.008 --> 02:16:49.590]  And... Oh yeah, your computer's been hijacked.
[02:16:49.590 --> 02:16:50.571]  Yeah, I'm hip.
[02:16:50.571 --> 02:16:57.797]  So, you know, that's why my friend Chris Walken, he doesn't have a computer, he doesn't have a phone, he's not on any Google Map.
[02:16:57.797 --> 02:17:01.399]  Now I'm realizing how smart he is.
[02:17:01.399 --> 02:17:05.843]  By the way, I'm seriously discussing with my wife getting computers completely out of the house.
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:10.305]  We're only coming into work to use them.
[02:17:10.305 --> 02:17:11.347]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:17:11.347 --> 02:17:15.193]  At the very least, tape the camera on your computer.
[02:17:15.193 --> 02:17:16.375]  Always keep that taped.
[02:17:17.513 --> 02:17:20.375]  Oh yeah, they used to call it a conspiracy theorist ten years ago about that.
[02:17:20.375 --> 02:17:22.416]  Now they just admit it.
[02:17:22.416 --> 02:17:23.757]  You're absolutely right.
[02:17:23.757 --> 02:17:28.500]  Why do you think the corruption is just getting so out of control, even compared to what it was?
[02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:31.222]  Or is it that we just know about the corruption now?
[02:17:31.222 --> 02:17:35.965]  No, I think it's a sinking ship and the rats are panicking.
[02:17:35.965 --> 02:17:39.527]  They have had mass mind control on us.
[02:17:39.527 --> 02:17:42.950]  They lied us into World War I and every war thereafter.
[02:17:43.650 --> 02:17:47.876]  Germany didn't lose World War II, they just changed their headquarters from Berlin to Washington.
[02:17:47.876 --> 02:17:55.866]  The Dulles brothers helped the Harrimans, the Bushes, Jack Kennedy's father, every rich family.
[02:17:55.866 --> 02:18:00.412]  When Teddy Roosevelt had all this antitrust stuff going on, all the most
[02:18:01.093 --> 02:18:11.881]  Richest families in America all put their money in Germany in the 20s, in part causing our depression, because they thought, hey, you know, they're union crushing and, you know, you can have monopolies.
[02:18:11.881 --> 02:18:17.025]  Then Hitler came in and they still supported Hitler, but then he got a little out of hand.
[02:18:17.025 --> 02:18:18.446]  So they had to really go in.
[02:18:18.446 --> 02:18:20.367]  But, you know, we didn't declare war on Germany.
[02:18:20.367 --> 02:18:22.389]  He declared war on us.
[02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:24.751]  Hitler was standing in Paris in 1940.
[02:18:24.751 --> 02:18:26.172]  We still were not at war with them.
[02:18:26.872 --> 02:18:28.113]  It's very, you know.
[02:18:28.113 --> 02:18:28.693]  No, that's right.
[02:18:28.693 --> 02:18:33.736]  When Japan declared war on us, he had a treaty and he declared war on us.
[02:18:33.736 --> 02:18:47.145]  Yeah, and he didn't even, he wasn't even, that was really an, it's chilling to think if he didn't, how far he would have gotten because General Motors was building trucks for him throughout the war.
[02:18:47.145 --> 02:18:49.306]  Standard Oil was helping him throughout the
[02:18:49.386 --> 02:18:54.187]  No, that's why he's so arrogant, or was so arrogant, and that's what people don't know.
[02:18:54.187 --> 02:18:58.448]  In 1939, they had Time Magazine saying what a great man he was.
[02:18:58.448 --> 02:19:07.870]  My grandfather, growing up in Dallas, they used to translate on the major Dallas stations Hitler's speeches like the president was speaking when he grew up.
[02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:12.731]  Oh yeah, when he grew up in the mid-30s in Dallas, Hitler was like a celebrity.
[02:19:13.847 --> 02:19:16.049]  That is astounding.
[02:19:16.049 --> 02:19:17.150]  Wow.
[02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:18.771]  But I'm not surprised.
[02:19:18.771 --> 02:19:20.533]  I'm shocked, but I'm not surprised.
[02:19:20.533 --> 02:19:28.300]  No, Alan Dulles and his brother John Foster Dulles, they started their careers at the Treaty of Versailles.
[02:19:29.201 --> 02:19:39.446]  When they chopped up Germany into 18 different places and broke up, you know, regions that normally were together, just setting the stage for World War II.
[02:19:39.446 --> 02:19:41.848]  That treaty, I mean, I'm not a fan of the Nazis.
[02:19:41.848 --> 02:19:42.688]  None of us are.
[02:19:42.688 --> 02:19:43.448]  No, no, absolutely.
[02:19:43.448 --> 02:19:47.070]  But it shows there's a larger hand above it all playing us off against each other.
[02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:48.131]  Richard Belzer, stay there.
[02:19:48.131 --> 02:19:52.233]  I want to get into the book and some of the killings of witnesses.
[02:19:52.233 --> 02:19:55.635]  I mean, why are these people getting killed that were witnesses if there's nothing to cover up?
[02:19:56.195 --> 02:19:57.015]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:19:57.015 --> 02:19:58.476]  We'll be right back with Richard Belzer.
[02:19:58.476 --> 02:20:01.277]  Get the book at InfoWarsTory.com.
[02:20:01.277 --> 02:20:03.677]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:20:03.677 --> 02:20:06.978]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:20:06.978 --> 02:20:09.159]  Some people think the answer is gold.
[02:20:09.159 --> 02:20:10.740]  Others think it's a gun.
[02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:13.120]  But the correct answer will shock you.
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:20.943]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:20:22.725 --> 02:20:25.348]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:20:25.348 --> 02:20:27.511]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:20:27.511 --> 02:20:35.001]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:20:35.001 --> 02:20:39.487]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:20:39.972 --> 02:20:46.194]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:20:46.194 --> 02:20:47.535]  You'll be shocked.

[02:20:52.756 --> 02:20:58.238]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:20:58.238 --> 02:20:59.599]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.

[02:21:31.788 --> 02:21:36.351]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:36.351 --> 02:21:42.155]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:42.155 --> 02:21:45.797]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.797 --> 02:21:48.519]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:22:00.807 --> 02:22:02.748]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:22:02.748 --> 02:22:05.570]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:22:05.570 --> 02:22:10.572]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:22:10.572 --> 02:22:14.614]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:22:14.614 --> 02:22:18.496]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:22:18.496 --> 02:22:19.877]  The fact is, you are.
[02:22:19.877 --> 02:22:20.898]  We all are.
[02:22:20.898 --> 02:22:23.219]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[02:24:23.995 --> 02:24:27.017]  I bet you recognize that music, Richard.
[02:24:27.017 --> 02:24:27.758]  Kills, actually.
[02:24:27.758 --> 02:24:29.479]  That was my first film.
[02:24:29.479 --> 02:24:31.420]  That's very hippy, your programmer there.
[02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:34.603]  Again, you've got the new book out.
[02:24:34.603 --> 02:24:36.544]  I want to get into a bunch of world issues with you.
[02:24:36.544 --> 02:24:38.806]  Attack on Iran may trigger World War III.
[02:24:38.806 --> 02:24:45.550]  Iranian envoy is saying that's up at Infowars.com directly from Press TV, the official Iranian news agency.
[02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:47.312]  The word I'm getting from high-level sources
[02:24:48.032 --> 02:24:52.153]  Is that now North Korea is the diversion for a strike on Iran.
[02:24:52.153 --> 02:24:54.253]  So things are heating up quickly.
[02:24:54.253 --> 02:25:00.555]  Let's get into the book, though, because you profile a bunch of the people that were murdered to cover up what they knew about JFK.
[02:25:00.555 --> 02:25:02.975]  Let's talk about Hit List, your new book.
[02:25:02.975 --> 02:25:03.575]  Sure.
[02:25:03.575 --> 02:25:05.216]  We got it down to 50.
[02:25:05.216 --> 02:25:08.197]  There are some researchers that go as high as 300.
[02:25:08.197 --> 02:25:12.557]  But, you know, you have to account some people are just going to die that were involved in the murder.
[02:25:12.557 --> 02:25:13.998]  So we try to narrow it down.
[02:25:15.118 --> 02:25:24.586]  And, as you know, I'm glad you like the style of our book because we tell you what the official verdict is, then we tell you the actual circumstances, then the inconsistencies.
[02:25:24.586 --> 02:25:25.686]  It's heavily footnoted.
[02:25:25.686 --> 02:25:28.429]  You show photos, documents, admissions.
[02:25:28.429 --> 02:25:30.690]  You're not just saying this is your opinion.
[02:25:30.690 --> 02:25:32.312]  It's almost like a court case.
[02:25:32.312 --> 02:25:36.415]  Yeah, this is in the history section, which I'm very proud of, as was my last book.
[02:25:36.415 --> 02:25:41.999]  It's not, you know, fiction or, you know, life could be taken lightly.
[02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:43.180]  The list has on it
[02:25:44.938 --> 02:25:49.444]  Officer Tippett, Oswald, Ruby, Zangretti.
[02:25:49.444 --> 02:25:54.231]  There's even one on here who was thought to be involved but wasn't, so we straighten that out.
[02:25:54.231 --> 02:25:56.754]  That was Karen Kapsina.
[02:26:00.358 --> 02:26:06.980]  If there's any particular one you want, some of them were, you know, people that predicted, you know, don't believe it if you hear I commit suicide.
[02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:13.161]  People, you know, had their right side of their head shot, you know, and the guns in their hand, they're left-handed.
[02:26:13.161 --> 02:26:16.942]  People die of karate chops, one-car accidents, electrocution.
[02:26:16.942 --> 02:26:23.264]  Yeah, no, it's like Gary Webb saying, they're breaking in my house, they're threatening to kill me, my new book's coming out, I'll never commit suicide.
[02:26:23.264 --> 02:26:27.405]  He shoots himself twice in the head, and the police instantly say it's suicide.
[02:26:28.897 --> 02:26:38.042]  I know Gary Webb and Danny Casolaro, people that get really close, it's frightening.
[02:26:38.042 --> 02:26:43.585]  But you know what's interesting is because of the internet, 1984 goes both ways now.
[02:26:43.585 --> 02:26:45.326]  So they may be watching us.
[02:26:46.286 --> 02:26:48.287]  We're certainly, you know, watching them, too.
[02:26:48.287 --> 02:26:51.708]  You also cover what they did to Oswald, and that he was CIA.
[02:26:51.708 --> 02:26:56.989]  I mean, right there, they executed him on TV to cover it up.
[02:26:56.989 --> 02:26:57.989]  I mean, boom!
[02:26:57.989 --> 02:26:59.730]  That's mind control.
[02:26:59.730 --> 02:27:10.413]  You know, when you can explode the President's head in broad daylight, and then shoot the guy who supposedly shot him on live television, that affects the collective unconscious of the entire nation.
[02:27:10.413 --> 02:27:11.993]  That was a message.
[02:27:11.993 --> 02:27:13.334]  And boy, did they send it.
[02:27:13.334 --> 02:27:14.174]  They got away with it.
[02:27:14.554 --> 02:27:21.998]  Yeah, Oswald, you know it's interesting when Nixon, the reason Nixon was ousted was not what we've been told.
[02:27:21.998 --> 02:27:31.602]  Nixon threatened the CIA that he was going to have the FBI investigate the CIA about the Bay of Pigs thing, which Haldeman said is code for the Kennedy assassination.
[02:27:31.602 --> 02:27:32.363]  Because Hoover
[02:27:33.323 --> 02:27:35.544]  You know, Oswald was working for Hoover.
[02:27:35.544 --> 02:27:37.264]  Yeah, that's even come out on the tapes.
[02:27:37.264 --> 02:27:40.625]  He wanted to, actually, he was a bad guy, but Nixon actually wanted to be president.
[02:27:40.625 --> 02:27:43.546]  And it's like, you know, the Bay of Pigs boys.
[02:27:43.546 --> 02:27:44.567]  You don't want to go there.
[02:27:44.567 --> 02:27:45.687]  That's Jack Kennedy.
[02:27:45.687 --> 02:27:47.288]  He's threatening him with that.
[02:27:47.288 --> 02:27:49.088]  And the establishment, really, buddy?
[02:27:49.088 --> 02:27:50.189]  Really?
[02:27:50.189 --> 02:27:53.730]  Well, JFK threatened him and they exploded his head, so Nixon should have known better.
[02:27:55.922 --> 02:28:05.507]  They learned that the CIA had broken their charter and were getting into things like the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam, which weren't covert operations.
[02:28:05.507 --> 02:28:08.209]  We ran 2.6 million troops through Vietnam.
[02:28:08.209 --> 02:28:09.729]  That's not covert.
[02:28:09.729 --> 02:28:16.473]  So Kennedy knew that the generals and the CIA were just, you know, really out to get him.
[02:28:16.633 --> 02:28:17.053]  That's right.
[02:28:17.053 --> 02:28:23.840]  Prior to the stage Gulf of Tonkin in 64, millions of people were rotated in as advisors.
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:25.701]  And how many tens of thousands died?
[02:28:25.701 --> 02:28:29.304]  But they're not counted to the official war tally.
[02:28:29.304 --> 02:28:30.365]  That's right.
[02:28:30.365 --> 02:28:32.467]  They say 56,000 or something.
[02:28:32.467 --> 02:28:39.974]  But there were more than that because you don't count the years that we were going in and sabotaging and doing all that stuff.
[02:28:39.974 --> 02:28:41.395]  Plus the million plus
[02:28:42.196 --> 02:28:47.200]  Some people say 3 million women and children, Vietnamese non-combatants.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:48.481]  Now this is dark stuff.
[02:28:48.481 --> 02:28:51.403]  That war was clearly a money-making war.
[02:28:51.403 --> 02:28:56.547]  When Kennedy was saying he wanted peace and détente, these guys just said, uh-oh.
[02:28:56.547 --> 02:28:59.970]  Oh yeah, they'd still have Vietnam War going if we stood for it, literally.
[02:28:59.970 --> 02:29:01.651]  Oh yeah, they made so much money there.
[02:29:02.452 --> 02:29:04.333]  And, you know, that was Eisenhower and Nixon.
[02:29:04.333 --> 02:29:04.873]  No one knew.
[02:29:04.873 --> 02:29:06.594]  It's like Truman.
[02:29:06.594 --> 02:29:09.835]  You know, everyone thought Dewey was going to win, and then Truman comes in.
[02:29:09.835 --> 02:29:11.235]  Truman didn't want the CIA.
[02:29:11.235 --> 02:29:15.637]  I hate Truman, by the way, because he dropped bombs unnecessarily on Japan.
[02:29:15.637 --> 02:29:18.858]  But he did do a couple of things that were pretty lucid.
[02:29:18.858 --> 02:29:21.099]  He didn't know that there were two CIAs.
[02:29:21.099 --> 02:29:28.922]  The Dulles brothers were running something out of the State Department, and the regular CIA was trying to, you know, really catch or, you know, do their job.
[02:29:28.922 --> 02:29:31.223]  And when Truman found out about it, he just
[02:29:32.423 --> 02:29:33.724]  His hands were tied.
[02:29:33.724 --> 02:29:34.344]  Absolutely.
[02:29:34.344 --> 02:29:35.044]  In fact, that's true.
[02:29:35.044 --> 02:29:39.165]  That's why I've always said the real CIA is in the State Department.
[02:29:39.165 --> 02:29:43.126]  And then Pecheneg's like, no, Alex, no, no, it's not actually in now.
[02:29:43.126 --> 02:29:45.147]  We'll be right back with Richard Belzer.
[02:29:45.147 --> 02:29:45.667]  Stay with us.

[02:31:04.947 --> 02:31:10.988]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[02:32:01.465 --> 02:32:02.525]  I had tried everything.
[02:32:02.525 --> 02:32:08.007]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:32:08.007 --> 02:32:12.849]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:32:12.849 --> 02:32:19.211]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:32:19.711 --> 02:32:30.920]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[02:32:41.668 --> 02:32:42.809]  Now that's results!
[02:32:43.209 --> 02:32:50.011]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.

[02:33:06.937 --> 02:33:10.758]  But it has different characteristics in different parts.
[02:33:14.466 --> 02:33:20.712]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.872 --> 02:33:31.275]  Alright, we'll take some of your phone calls here with Richard Belzer, but I want to get a little bit more into the book.
[02:33:31.275 --> 02:33:32.716]  Everybody really should read it.
[02:33:32.716 --> 02:33:39.400]  It's available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:41.862]  And you may think, you know, a lot about JFK.
[02:33:41.862 --> 02:33:47.606]  This really shows you all the people they set up, they killed, they demonized.
[02:33:47.606 --> 02:33:49.427]  It's a very, very important book.
[02:33:49.427 --> 02:33:51.008]  Hit list.
[02:33:51.008 --> 02:33:55.291]  The new book just coming out by Richard Belzer with David Wayne.
[02:33:55.291 --> 02:33:56.532]  Now expanding
[02:33:58.012 --> 02:34:15.198]  On all this, the head of the Italian Supreme Court, their Chief Justice, their CIA head has also come out and said that the West, that NATO has a terror group that stages terror attacks and that they've used right-wing, communist terror, Muslim terror as a pretext to take everybody's rights.
[02:34:15.198 --> 02:34:19.299]  And that, quote, the Bilderberg group is calling the shots and that he has proof.
[02:34:19.299 --> 02:34:21.800]  This is in the biggest Italian newspapers now.
[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:28.062]  So my point is, is that no wonder the media is not supposed to report on Bilderberg over these years.
[02:34:28.062 --> 02:34:30.083]  That shows how important it is.
[02:34:30.083 --> 02:34:34.685]  Now that it's been forced out, Glenn Beck's like, Alex Jones shouldn't talk about Bilderberg.
[02:34:34.685 --> 02:34:35.745]  That's kooky.
[02:34:35.745 --> 02:34:36.765]  They don't run anything.
[02:34:39.315 --> 02:34:42.036]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not even here to bash Glenn Beck.
[02:34:42.036 --> 02:34:43.377]  He does some good work.
[02:34:43.377 --> 02:34:44.498]  I want to unify everybody.
[02:34:44.498 --> 02:34:48.259]  My point is, he won't even talk about him and makes fun of people.
[02:34:48.259 --> 02:34:49.980]  That's because they're at the top of the pyramid.
[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:54.122]  But, Richard, continuing, let's get into some of the most important... Can I just say one quick thing, Alex?
[02:34:54.122 --> 02:34:56.343]  The Muslim Brotherhood are Nazis.
[02:34:56.343 --> 02:34:57.984]  They're not neo-Nazis.
[02:34:57.984 --> 02:35:02.526]  Alan Dahl has convinced the Saudis to take them in after World War II.
[02:35:02.526 --> 02:35:02.746]  Sure.
[02:35:02.746 --> 02:35:04.687]  Because the Arabs were pro-Nazi.
[02:35:04.687 --> 02:35:06.068]  And the Grand Imam and all of it.
[02:35:06.568 --> 02:35:09.450]  And they all went to Saudi Arabia, and guess what they did?
[02:35:09.450 --> 02:35:12.551]  They started the madrasas.
[02:35:12.551 --> 02:35:29.399]  No, no, no, our government, you're absolutely right, I love it when somebody knows history, this is all, there was a scandal 15 years ago, the Washington Post reported, we were still paying hundreds of millions a year, all over the Muslim world, to pay for school books that said kill America.
[02:35:29.399 --> 02:35:30.080]  To this day!
[02:35:31.291 --> 02:35:33.191]  But, you know, they're real Nazis.
[02:35:33.191 --> 02:35:34.512]  It's not like Neo-Nazis.
[02:35:34.512 --> 02:35:36.832]  They're second-generation Nazis.
[02:35:36.832 --> 02:35:39.633]  Well, no, no, I mean, it's Writers of the Lost Ark.
[02:35:39.633 --> 02:35:42.714]  They create the next group of opposition.
[02:35:42.714 --> 02:35:47.075]  That's why they're putting the Muslim Brotherhood in everywhere, and that's Obama.
[02:35:47.075 --> 02:35:49.416]  Well, it's just a formula that they always use.
[02:35:49.416 --> 02:35:51.756]  Obama's just... Presidents are part-time workers.
[02:35:51.756 --> 02:35:53.277]  Exactly.
[02:35:53.277 --> 02:35:55.957]  That's why it takes off, what, like four months out of the year now?
[02:35:55.957 --> 02:35:58.738]  Now, stopping right there, Richard, let's get into some more of the cases in the book.
[02:35:59.963 --> 02:36:04.105]  I think, you know, number one in the book is Tippett, who's very mysterious.
[02:36:04.105 --> 02:36:09.747]  You know, we found out that he worked for an intelligence unit in Dallas.
[02:36:09.747 --> 02:36:12.168]  He wasn't supposed to be where he was.
[02:36:12.168 --> 02:36:13.328]  It's very fishy.
[02:36:13.328 --> 02:36:15.689]  Oswald did not shoot Tippett.
[02:36:15.689 --> 02:36:20.431]  You know, the officer on the scene marked the shells at the scene.
[02:36:20.431 --> 02:36:22.252]  And, you know, then when he went to see the
[02:36:23.272 --> 02:36:25.834]  Uh, exhibits, uh, there are different shells there.
[02:36:25.834 --> 02:36:28.496]  So, you know, it was a different gun.
[02:36:28.496 --> 02:36:32.699]  And, uh, Tippett was seen having breakfast with Oswald.
[02:36:32.699 --> 02:36:34.561]  Um, he's a very fishy character.
[02:36:34.561 --> 02:36:35.241]  And, um...
[02:36:36.949 --> 02:36:40.712]  Uh, we traced all his movements, which are very suspicious.
[02:36:40.712 --> 02:36:43.314]  He had no business being where he was.
[02:36:43.314 --> 02:36:55.182]  He was also seen with, um, Ruby, uh, and, and Oswalt, and, uh, a lot of people don't know that a lot of local police departments are infiltrated by military intelligence.
[02:36:55.182 --> 02:36:56.022]  Oh, massively.
[02:36:58.729 --> 02:37:03.673]  So, and number two is Oswald, who, you know, had an FBI number.
[02:37:03.673 --> 02:37:06.395]  He was getting $200 a month from the FBI.
[02:37:06.395 --> 02:37:17.343]  Hoover was so interested in Oswald that in 1959, he wrote a memo saying, someone's using Lee Harvey Oswald's ID while he's, you know, overseas trying to buy trucks for Cubans.
[02:37:17.343 --> 02:37:19.825]  You know, like, it's just been there.
[02:37:19.825 --> 02:37:22.247]  Ruby Testa was a witness for Nixon in 1947.
[02:37:23.148 --> 02:37:26.169]  You know, a lot of people say he was low-level, but I think that's a cover.
[02:37:26.169 --> 02:37:31.231]  If you look at what he really did, it's almost like he was a operational commander.
[02:37:31.231 --> 02:37:35.813]  And then, of course, that's who they burned to get rid, to burn the whole thing down.
[02:37:35.813 --> 02:37:36.793]  They do that a lot.
[02:37:36.793 --> 02:37:38.434]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[02:37:38.434 --> 02:37:45.897]  They paint a picture of Oswald as a lone nod and kind of inarticulate, but there are at least two Oswalds.
[02:37:45.897 --> 02:37:46.737]  That goes without saying.
[02:37:47.297 --> 02:37:51.019]  And Oswald was recruited as a child, or as a teenager.
[02:37:51.019 --> 02:37:52.879]  I mean, this guy was... Some theories about that.
[02:37:52.879 --> 02:37:55.581]  Well, yeah, he was a fake defector.
[02:37:55.581 --> 02:38:02.583]  When he was a young, you know, they sent like 18 or 19 Marines and Army over to Russia to pretend they were defecting.
[02:38:02.583 --> 02:38:05.284]  Russia knew about each and every one of them virtually.
[02:38:05.284 --> 02:38:10.507]  Sure, but his recruitment even into the military, if you go back and look at it, had all these connections as well.
[02:38:10.507 --> 02:38:12.387]  I mean, he was... I'm not surprised.
[02:38:14.148 --> 02:38:18.350]  Hoover, that's why Nixon went to Hoover, because he could blackmail the CIA.
[02:38:18.350 --> 02:38:26.254]  But the CIA was also using Oswald, so it got really, really sticky and messy for both agencies.
[02:38:26.254 --> 02:38:31.877]  And Oswald was supposed to be taken out in the movie theater, and he wasn't.
[02:38:31.877 --> 02:38:35.359]  You know, so they had to get Ruble, you know, that story.
[02:38:36.259 --> 02:38:41.303]  Well, McVeigh got mad about them wanting him to blow up the Oklahoma City building, and he said, no kids.
[02:38:41.303 --> 02:38:43.884]  No women, no kids, like Tony Montana.
[02:38:43.884 --> 02:38:47.487]  He was Special Forces, and it's the same deal, so they set him up.
[02:38:47.487 --> 02:38:49.048]  Right.
[02:38:49.048 --> 02:38:51.670]  And Ruby is, you know, just the dirtiest.
[02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:56.733]  He was an informant in 1947 for Nixon for a crime commission.
[02:38:56.733 --> 02:39:00.235]  He ran drugs and guns through Cuba.
[02:39:00.235 --> 02:39:02.937]  You know, he put in a ton of money just before he went.
[02:39:02.937 --> 02:39:04.598]  Not a ton, but you know, like 17 or 18 grand or something.
[02:39:05.859 --> 02:39:08.561]  You know, the timing of it was impeccable.
[02:39:08.561 --> 02:39:10.503]  He knew he was going to be murdered.
[02:39:10.503 --> 02:39:14.105]  You know, he said, and then they gave him this fast-acting cancer.
[02:39:14.105 --> 02:39:18.449]  The CIA, as you know, Alex, can kill us in so many ways.
[02:39:18.449 --> 02:39:22.032]  So that's why you have to be really, really careful.
[02:39:22.032 --> 02:39:27.496]  I mean, they could walk by you and just spray some aerosol and it's over.
[02:39:27.876 --> 02:39:40.050]  So, you know, they have, they have an ice, they have a gun that shoots bullets that are made out of ice that look like a period so small that goes in and kills you and, you know, melts.
[02:39:40.050 --> 02:39:44.695]  And, you know, unless you're a genius forensics guy, you don't see that tiny, tiny hole.
[02:39:45.655 --> 02:40:04.948]  Anyway, you know, so the Tippett... Speaking of Tippett, to use a pun, the tip-off they've killed somebody is when they immediately say no foul play, immediately say it's suicider, Breitbart's not even cold, and they're saying, oh no, heart attack, you know, 45 minutes after he's put into the hospital.
[02:40:04.948 --> 02:40:09.691]  I mean, that's when you really know is when they immediately come out with the official story.
[02:40:09.691 --> 02:40:09.971]  Go ahead.
[02:40:10.111 --> 02:40:11.371]  Yeah, exactly right.
[02:40:11.371 --> 02:40:23.275]  That was, that's really fishy when, you know, I mean, they got Oswald, what, 70 minutes later and had descriptions of him in New Zealand, like, you know, he wasn't on the watch list.
[02:40:23.275 --> 02:40:26.096]  He was, but they didn't tell Dallas police.
[02:40:26.096 --> 02:40:30.098]  You know, it's very interesting because people don't understand.
[02:40:30.098 --> 02:40:33.839]  There are elements within the Dallas police that had no knowledge of anything.
[02:40:33.839 --> 02:40:39.521]  There are elements that did, elements within the CIA and, you know, and like Grant Stock,
[02:40:40.221 --> 02:40:52.384]  Stockwell, you know, a big former ambassador to Ireland, fell or was pushed from his office window on the 13th floor of the DuPont building in Midtown Miami.
[02:40:52.384 --> 02:40:53.904]  And I called it suicide.
[02:40:53.904 --> 02:40:58.266]  But, you know, it's in like two reporters.
[02:40:58.266 --> 02:40:59.726]  This is a good point.
[02:40:59.726 --> 02:41:03.807]  And I mean, I don't mean that in a light way, but Jim Coats and Bill Hunter.
[02:41:04.463 --> 02:41:16.107]  There were two reporters who were in a room where it was openly discussed prior to the murder of Kennedy about killing Kennedy at this Cuban woman's house.
[02:41:16.107 --> 02:41:17.608]  They happened to be there.
[02:41:17.608 --> 02:41:18.548]  Okay.
[02:41:18.548 --> 02:41:23.850]  Coth, victim, surprised a burglar and burglar killed him.
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:26.021]  Hunter?
[02:41:26.021 --> 02:41:29.023]  Accidental shooting by a police officer.
[02:41:29.023 --> 02:41:34.226]  So, those are two reporters that they just took out because they heard foreknowledge.
[02:41:34.226 --> 02:41:45.294]  One of the saddest, I think, is Dorothy Kilgallen, who, you know, people know from What's My Line, but she was a tough, old broad in a true, respectful, non-chauvinist sense.
[02:41:45.894 --> 02:41:52.559]  And was a really good reporter and she was the only person that got in to talk to Ruby by herself.
[02:41:52.559 --> 02:41:55.321]  There were reporters, some people said, oh, a lot of reporters were there.
[02:41:55.321 --> 02:41:57.662]  No, she got in a room with him alone.
[02:41:57.662 --> 02:42:03.646]  She told her agent, her best friend and two other people, she has all this explosive information.
[02:42:03.646 --> 02:42:05.768]  She's going to blow the lid off the Kennedy case.
[02:42:06.588 --> 02:42:20.196]  And word got out, so Hoover started demonizing her, and she said the FBI would have their time better spent investigating who killed our president than harassing me.
[02:42:20.196 --> 02:42:22.698]  So anyway, that's demonization I was talking about.
[02:42:22.698 --> 02:42:23.138]  Keep going.
[02:42:23.138 --> 02:42:24.219]  Exactly.
[02:42:24.219 --> 02:42:27.420]  And she dies in bed with all her makeup on.
[02:42:30.382 --> 02:42:30.542]  I'm good.
[02:42:45.279 --> 02:42:49.560]  She committed suicide or accidentally ingested barbiturates.
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:50.821]  They murdered her.
[02:42:50.821 --> 02:42:56.322]  Her best friend, who she gave, you know, who knew all about it, she died like a day or two later.
[02:42:56.322 --> 02:43:00.383]  You know, it's like David Ferry and that doctor he was working with.
[02:43:00.383 --> 02:43:06.385]  They were whacked within 48 hours because Ferry was... And by the way, everybody that serves the New World Order should understand this.
[02:43:07.225 --> 02:43:10.728]  They always end up getting rid of the people that do the dirty work.
[02:43:10.728 --> 02:43:12.089]  You're fools.
[02:43:12.089 --> 02:43:13.711]  You're absolutely right.
[02:43:13.711 --> 02:43:20.116]  Virtually everyone, populists obviously included, is expendable to these people.
[02:43:20.116 --> 02:43:23.339]  Except E. Howard Heintz, and they probably wish they had killed him now.
[02:43:23.999 --> 02:43:25.680]  Well, you know, it's the irony of that.
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:26.601]  I'm sure you've had St.
[02:43:26.601 --> 02:43:27.381]  John on, right?
[02:43:27.381 --> 02:43:27.782]  Yes.
[02:43:27.782 --> 02:43:31.224]  The son who he confessed to, and then he rallied and didn't die.
[02:43:31.224 --> 02:43:38.389]  He literally made a deathbed confession, and then he somehow lived a little longer, and then he had to recant.
[02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:39.670]  That guy was tough.
[02:43:39.670 --> 02:43:45.974]  His whole story, most of it's classified, but what we know, really, really wild guy.
[02:43:45.974 --> 02:43:48.776]  I mean, a sniper in World War II, the whole nine yards.
[02:43:48.776 --> 02:43:51.097]  Psyops guy, really dark.
[02:43:51.097 --> 02:43:53.399]  You know, he had his ears operated on.
[02:43:54.799 --> 02:43:56.880]  Uh, because, you know, ears aren't identifying it.
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:43:58.741]  After, yeah, he got picked up at the railway station.
[02:43:58.741 --> 02:43:59.882]  Tell folks about that.
[02:43:59.882 --> 02:44:11.228]  Yeah, well, you know, there's a guy who looks remarkable, the so-called Tramps, who had, who were, for Tramps, had new shoes on, and were clean-shaven, and were strolling Calgary.
[02:44:11.228 --> 02:44:11.588]  St.
[02:44:11.588 --> 02:44:11.948]  John, St.
[02:44:11.948 --> 02:44:19.833]  John Hunt remembers seeing that when he was a kid, hanging up in a phone booth when it came out, and thinking, seeing, oh, Dad!
[02:44:19.833 --> 02:44:24.035]  He didn't even read that it was like, here's the Tramps, it was a JFK seminar or something.
[02:44:24.295 --> 02:44:24.756]  That's right.
[02:44:41.093 --> 02:44:47.437]  The jury believed that Hunt was involved in a conspiracy by the government to assassinate the president.
[02:44:47.437 --> 02:44:49.638]  That's a jury trial.
[02:44:49.638 --> 02:44:58.983]  But he had his ears operated on by the time of the trial so that he could maybe disguise his appearance.
[02:44:58.983 --> 02:45:02.085]  That was pretty lame, actually.
[02:45:02.085 --> 02:45:05.527]  And again, this is important because they just go, aha, the crazy people!
[02:45:06.900 --> 02:45:07.281]  I think so.
[02:45:23.819 --> 02:45:28.544]  Now 90% of the average poll, as you source in your book, know that it was a conspiracy.
[02:45:28.544 --> 02:45:31.707]  So this is a victory for the truth.
[02:45:31.707 --> 02:45:38.534]  What do you think of Tom Hanks and all these people trying to resuscitate Humpty Dumpty?
[02:45:38.534 --> 02:45:40.096]  I'm going to tell you a story about this.
[02:45:40.096 --> 02:45:45.121]  I was at my friend Martin Short's house a couple of years ago, not to drop names.
[02:45:46.474 --> 02:45:50.676]  Every year he has a Christmas party and every major celebrity is there.
[02:45:50.676 --> 02:45:52.637]  You know, it's a fun thing.
[02:45:52.637 --> 02:45:57.419]  And then Paul Schaeffer or someone will go over to the piano and will sing and it's private.
[02:45:57.419 --> 02:45:58.119]  It's really cool.
[02:45:58.119 --> 02:45:59.099]  And Tom was there.
[02:45:59.099 --> 02:46:02.701]  This is about, I think, two or three New Year's ago.
[02:46:02.701 --> 02:46:06.663]  And I knew that he was going to... I read he's doing a 10-part series for HBO.
[02:46:07.663 --> 02:46:09.864]  About the Kennedy assassination.
[02:46:09.864 --> 02:46:13.606]  And then I read, he said, Oh, the conspiracy theorists are going to be upset with me.
[02:46:13.606 --> 02:46:20.650]  So I went over to him at this party and I don't usually do this, Alex, but I, I know Tom and I liked Tom.
[02:46:20.650 --> 02:46:26.394]  I said, Tom, as a friend, I'm telling you, do not do this documentary.
[02:46:27.321 --> 02:46:30.223]  He said, well, I'm basing it on Vincent Bugliosi's book.
[02:46:30.223 --> 02:46:37.087]  I said, Tom, that was a prosecutor who did a steroid version of the Warren Commission.
[02:46:37.087 --> 02:46:38.929]  It's all false scholarship.
[02:46:38.929 --> 02:46:41.190]  And the narrative is going to be an embarrassment.
[02:46:41.190 --> 02:46:41.911]  And that money would be...
[02:46:43.011 --> 02:46:48.913]  Much more well spent on other things, you know, like the vets or kids or, you know what I mean?
[02:46:48.913 --> 02:46:51.434]  Like millions of dollars to do 10 hours.
[02:46:51.434 --> 02:46:52.574]  Oswald did it.
[02:46:52.574 --> 02:46:56.195]  I just felt, you know, I'm paraphrasing, but that's essentially what I said to him.
[02:46:56.195 --> 02:47:00.897]  And then I explained to him why it was physically impossible for Oswald to even have fired a shot.
[02:47:01.417 --> 02:47:02.839]  You know, he's having lunch on the first floor.
[02:47:02.839 --> 02:47:04.140]  He went to the second floor.
[02:47:04.140 --> 02:47:13.730]  I mean, I don't want to get into the minutiae, but I really wanted Tom not to do this, not to embarrass himself, not to misinform the public because he's a beloved guy.
[02:47:13.730 --> 02:47:15.552]  So time passes.
[02:47:15.552 --> 02:47:18.956]  I bump into him at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner backstage.
[02:47:18.956 --> 02:47:21.218]  He's got two security guys with him.
[02:47:21.218 --> 02:47:23.420]  And I just went over to say hello.
[02:47:24.361 --> 02:47:36.447]  And he sees me, and this is the first time since the New Year's Eve party, and he comes over and we embrace and he goes, hey, Bills, don't worry, I'm on the case and he scurries off, which he has never done to me.
[02:47:36.447 --> 02:47:43.451]  We always talk and joke and, you know, and just so because he thought I was going to ask him what's happening with the Kennedy thing.
[02:47:43.991 --> 02:47:47.673]  So I mean, I love Tom, but he's now he's doing a movie.
[02:47:47.673 --> 02:47:49.153]  He's learned part of his lesson.
[02:47:49.153 --> 02:47:51.214]  He's not doing a 10-hour documentary anymore.
[02:47:51.214 --> 02:47:56.597]  He's doing a feature film about that day in Dallas and how it affected people.
[02:47:56.597 --> 02:48:01.459]  But it's gonna, you know, it's gonna reinforce this myth that
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:08.687]  But the myth is showing, I mean, if half the public thought the government killed Kennedy, it might work.
[02:48:08.687 --> 02:48:11.670]  He's really going to hurt himself with this.
[02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:12.611]  Absolutely.
[02:48:12.611 --> 02:48:16.316]  Especially now, because Alex, it's the 50th anniversary.
[02:48:16.316 --> 02:48:21.862]  There's dozens and dozens of books, and I so appreciate you talking about my book, because we really try to
[02:48:23.464 --> 02:48:25.365]  No, I agree with your strategy.
[02:48:25.365 --> 02:48:28.767]  I mean, the killing of all these people is just ridiculous.
[02:48:28.767 --> 02:48:30.028]  I mean, they're covering it up.
[02:48:30.028 --> 02:48:32.149]  That's the evidence of the crime right there.
[02:48:32.149 --> 02:48:39.574]  If a cop pulls up and sees you look at them paranoidly running your house, that becomes almost probable cause.
[02:48:39.574 --> 02:48:46.158]  Well, when you've got piles of dead bodies and evidence of like someone shoving something in their pants, I mean, this is very suspicious.
[02:48:46.818 --> 02:48:49.979]  Yeah, it's terrifying, but you know what?
[02:48:49.979 --> 02:48:52.239]  A reasonable suspicion is the word, go ahead.
[02:48:52.239 --> 02:49:02.601]  Yeah, but you know, Thomas Jefferson and Adams, they were talking about if the electorate, if the people are not informed, then the country doesn't have any reason to exist.
[02:49:02.601 --> 02:49:14.023]  They said the great object is that the whole of the electorate be informed and educated about the way the world works, to paraphrase it, and then tyranny will vanish like phantoms at dawn.
[02:49:15.552 --> 02:49:16.892]  Exactly right.
[02:49:16.892 --> 02:49:24.434]  And, you know, it's amazing that over 200 years ago, these guys predicted what could happen.
[02:49:24.434 --> 02:49:28.836]  Because, you know, they designed it where the country's a pyramid, but it's inverted.
[02:49:28.836 --> 02:49:35.638]  In other words, the people are at the top and the elected officials are at the bottom because the people are supposed to... Now they flipped it.
[02:49:35.638 --> 02:49:40.399]  So the elite now that the, you know, and it gets fewer and fewer, which is
[02:49:40.999 --> 02:49:43.041]  Really why I think we're we're making.
[02:49:43.041 --> 02:49:47.065]  Oh, you've seen how they're killing all these oligarchs and taking the money of the billionaires in front.
[02:49:47.065 --> 02:49:49.427]  I mean, they are just looting the hell out of each other.
[02:49:49.427 --> 02:49:52.811]  And then it turns out the billionaires that robbed them aren't exempt.
[02:49:52.811 --> 02:49:54.953]  I mean, it's just good old fashioned mafia.
[02:49:54.953 --> 02:49:59.297]  And when good people give in to corruption, it just invites more.
[02:49:59.297 --> 02:49:59.837]  I don't know.
[02:50:00.618 --> 02:50:01.259]  That's right.
[02:50:01.259 --> 02:50:13.532]  A lot of good people, though, are seduced into something thinking they're doing something, you know, for national security or, you know, but they're really fronting... Oh no, when I've been approached, you know, off record about big media jobs, they're like, Alex, globalism is real.
[02:50:13.532 --> 02:50:14.713]  We're lifting up the third world.
[02:50:14.713 --> 02:50:16.214]  And yeah, there is a new world order.
[02:50:16.214 --> 02:50:17.316]  We've got to lead the world.
[02:50:17.316 --> 02:50:19.338]  And Alex, the Federal Reserve cares.
[02:50:19.338 --> 02:50:22.701]  And how would you like to make 15 million, 20 million a year?
[02:50:22.701 --> 02:50:23.082]  How's that sound?
[02:50:23.482 --> 02:50:28.565]  You know, I mean, but that's how they come at you, is we're gonna, you're gonna be a good guy!
[02:50:28.565 --> 02:50:31.327]  But I'm sorry, I've looked at this tree's fruits, Richard.
[02:50:31.327 --> 02:50:33.409]  It is not putting out good fruit.
[02:50:33.409 --> 02:50:36.471]  You know, you and I both were inspired by this book.
[02:50:36.471 --> 02:50:37.872]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy.
[02:50:37.872 --> 02:50:38.972]  Yeah, I read that.
[02:50:38.972 --> 02:50:40.373]  Look at how, look at my copy.
[02:50:40.373 --> 02:50:41.494]  It cost a dollar.
[02:50:41.494 --> 02:50:42.455]  That's how old I am.
[02:50:43.135 --> 02:50:47.741]  Um, no, that, that, that really blew my... Hey, bro, let's take a couple segments of calls straight ahead.
[02:50:47.741 --> 02:50:52.908]  They're all over the map, but I promise I'm gonna get to Brendan and Richard and Nick and David.
[02:50:52.908 --> 02:50:53.909]  The new book is out.
[02:50:53.909 --> 02:50:55.471]  It's hit list.

[02:52:51.363 --> 02:52:52.864]  The war is here.
[02:52:52.864 --> 02:52:54.764]  It's an info war.
[02:52:54.764 --> 02:52:57.446]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:53:01.127 --> 02:53:05.891]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.

[02:53:08.933 --> 02:53:17.899]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[02:54:22.119 --> 02:54:24.280]  This is, because you think I'm sick of JFK.
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:24.701]  I'm not.
[02:54:24.701 --> 02:54:26.962]  A book like this, I went through this in two nights.
[02:54:28.122 --> 02:54:30.004]  Reading and even learned some stuff I didn't know.
[02:54:30.004 --> 02:54:32.306]  Went and looked up some facts.
[02:54:32.306 --> 02:54:34.409]  It's very scholarly with David Wayne.
[02:54:34.409 --> 02:54:40.575]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com when you buy books, videos, t-shirts, all that at the site you fund our operation.
[02:54:40.575 --> 02:54:41.996]  Don't forget InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:54:41.996 --> 02:54:46.220]  You can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month and give it to your friends and family.
[02:54:46.220 --> 02:54:48.202]  Big nightly news.
[02:54:48.202 --> 02:54:48.622]  You know what?
[02:54:48.622 --> 02:54:50.644]  I've got to go even into more overdrive.
[02:54:51.405 --> 02:54:58.413]  Because we've got a big ammo shortage rationing report a week in the making that David Knight finished.
[02:54:58.413 --> 02:54:58.994]  You know what?
[02:54:58.994 --> 02:55:02.177]  I'll premiere it on the Nightly News tonight and play it on the radio tomorrow.
[02:55:02.177 --> 02:55:02.918]  So I'll do that.
[02:55:02.918 --> 02:55:05.180]  That'll be tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:55:05.180 --> 02:55:07.303]  Right now, let's talk to Brendan.
[02:55:07.303 --> 02:55:10.626]  I want to talk about guns, Mark Dyson, Bilderberg.
[02:55:10.626 --> 02:55:11.808]  Go ahead, Brendan, you're on the air.
[02:55:12.915 --> 02:55:13.696]  No, that's all right.
[02:55:13.696 --> 02:55:18.100]  That's what I was calling you about, but it's an honor to talk to Richard.
[02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:23.145]  I actually am holding in my hands a red... May I interrupt?
[02:55:23.145 --> 02:55:23.766]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[02:55:23.766 --> 02:55:25.107]  They forgot to turn him up to the guest.
[02:55:25.107 --> 02:55:26.749]  It's not turned up properly there.
[02:55:26.749 --> 02:55:30.773]  He said it's an honor to talk to you, Richard.
[02:55:30.773 --> 02:55:31.554]  Go ahead and call her.
[02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:45.123]  Yep, and actually I'm holding in my hands a red Freedom t-shirt from Infowars store that was signed by comedian Bill Burr, who was in my restaurant last week.
[02:55:45.123 --> 02:55:55.986]  And it just made me think that it's an honor to talk to Richard and I wish more people would come out and talk about the things that they know in their hearts and are watching.
[02:55:55.986 --> 02:56:01.028]  So I talked to Bill Burr... By the way, there are subtle ways that... Can I talk about it a little more, please?
[02:56:02.116 --> 02:56:03.278]  Sorry.
[02:56:03.278 --> 02:56:06.645]  No, it's alright.
[02:56:06.645 --> 02:56:11.253]  People a lot of times call in and they talk about small talk and that's great and I appreciate your support.
[02:56:11.253 --> 02:56:12.816]  Do you have a question for Richard Belzer?
[02:56:14.894 --> 02:56:17.216]  How do you think we can turn on more people?
[02:56:17.216 --> 02:56:19.037]  I mean, maybe not Christopher Walken.
[02:56:19.037 --> 02:56:30.065]  How do you think we can reach out to more celebrities who are willing to talk about being awake and the things that are actually happening and not the mainstream media?
[02:56:30.065 --> 02:56:31.386]  That's a great question, Brendan.
[02:56:31.386 --> 02:56:33.368]  Thank you so much and God bless you.
[02:56:33.368 --> 02:56:34.889]  They're from Wisconsin.
[02:56:34.889 --> 02:56:35.990]  Yeah, great question.
[02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:37.671]  Thanks, Brendan.
[02:56:37.671 --> 02:56:42.895]  Well, the problem is a lot of celebrities are terrified to take an extreme position
[02:56:43.715 --> 02:56:47.843]  Unless it's like on the environment or something and that's not a slam.
[02:56:47.843 --> 02:56:53.174]  But if we have extreme tyranny, there's got to be an extreme response as Barry Goldwater said.
[02:56:55.771 --> 02:57:19.366]  Yes, and you know, I think that your show is growing, actually, daily, I would imagine, and weekly, and your brilliant idea of having people get access to information, then turn on 50 other people, and you know, it's like with my books, you know, people tell other people, it's like, you know, it really is we the people.
[02:57:19.366 --> 02:57:20.527]  I mean, somehow,
[02:57:21.267 --> 02:57:30.655]  The elites have kind of demonized the common man, which would make Jefferson puke.
[02:57:30.655 --> 02:57:34.759]  He admired the common man, the hard-working man.
[02:57:34.759 --> 02:57:37.481]  I'm not being patronizing on his... No, no, it's true!
[02:57:38.362 --> 02:57:38.762]  I don't know.
[02:58:00.230 --> 02:58:14.841]  Well that's the thing, you know, America's always had problems, but as it got more and more corrupt, then the worst guy in the room becomes the boss, and then somebody worse replaces that group, and pretty soon you've got a bunch of people that want tyranny just because it's fun to exercise the power.
[02:58:14.841 --> 02:58:24.047]  Yeah, they're sociopaths, and, you know, it's about the money, but it's also about this power and this delight.
[02:58:24.047 --> 02:58:27.210]  And this is, I'm talking in psychological terms, I have studied this very deeply.
[02:58:29.244 --> 02:58:30.525]  Well, hold on, we've got to go to break.
[02:58:30.525 --> 02:58:34.989]  We're going to come right back with Richard Belzer to talk about The Delight on the other side.
[02:58:34.989 --> 02:58:39.812]  If your station doesn't carry it, audio, streams and video at prisonplanet.tv and fullwars.com.
[02:58:39.812 --> 02:58:43.395]  Get our free iPhone app.
[02:58:43.395 --> 02:58:44.336]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.336 --> 02:58:46.137]  And we'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock, in Full Wars.
[02:58:46.137 --> 02:58:52.102]  Not only news, Overdrive starts now.
[02:58:52.102 --> 02:58:57.927]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:58:58.829 --> 02:59:05.592]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[02:59:05.592 --> 02:59:16.538]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[02:59:16.538 --> 02:59:20.680]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:59:20.680 --> 02:59:26.883]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:59:27.603 --> 02:59:28.223]  We're good to go!
[02:59:52.142 --> 02:59:53.083]  Big Brother.
[02:59:53.083 --> 02:59:53.884]  Mainstream media.
[02:59:53.884 --> 02:59:54.484]  Government cover-ups.
[02:59:54.484 --> 02:59:55.045]  You want answers?
[02:59:55.045 --> 02:59:56.206]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.923 --> 03:00:18.126]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.126 --> 03:00:22.409]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.409 --> 03:00:28.673]  Hey Richard, I want to get you on the nightly news in the next few weeks.
[03:00:28.673 --> 03:00:36.658]  Let's set this up, Richard Belzer is our guest, to go over all 50 people you put in the book that were mysteriously murdered.
[03:00:36.658 --> 03:00:37.899]  So we'll set that up after the show today.
[03:00:37.899 --> 03:00:42.002]  I want to apologize to your listeners, because I do go on and I really want to, you know...
[03:00:42.622 --> 03:00:44.103]  Yeah, what I'm studying now for my next book
[03:01:10.058 --> 03:01:16.063]  Is, to what extent are true sociopathic personalities dominating governments today?
[03:01:16.063 --> 03:01:18.365]  And why do people tolerate them?
[03:01:18.365 --> 03:01:18.966]  You know what I mean?
[03:01:18.966 --> 03:01:24.010]  It's like, there's a great book about, uh, the shaping of collective memory.
[03:01:24.010 --> 03:01:26.032]  It's like, who owns the story?
[03:01:26.032 --> 03:01:26.672]  You know what I mean?
[03:01:26.672 --> 03:01:32.857]  Tom Wicker, Dan Rather, George Will, like four or five reporters, you know, they covered the Kennedy murder in 63.
[03:01:32.857 --> 03:01:38.102]  They don't own the narrative anymore, so what they're trying to do is just scramble the narrative where there is no narrative.
[03:01:38.362 --> 03:01:40.004]  That's exactly right.
[03:01:40.004 --> 03:01:45.870]  But people are still holding on to this narrative, you know, out of institutional embarrassment.
[03:01:45.870 --> 03:01:53.418]  That's why I think the corporate press is not just saying, OK, come on, you know, more than one person was involved.
[03:01:53.418 --> 03:01:55.860]  OK, you know, they won't even say that.
[03:01:55.860 --> 03:01:58.743]  And it's out of because they blew the story.
[03:01:58.743 --> 03:01:59.244]  And, you know,
[03:02:00.585 --> 03:02:09.690]  All these great reporters, you know, have not... Even Congress, as you know, in the investigation nobody talks about, found it was a conspiracy.
[03:02:09.690 --> 03:02:12.532]  And if they get caught on this, it's over for them.
[03:02:13.447 --> 03:02:17.989]  Well, you know, a lot of people that were involved are no longer with us.
[03:02:17.989 --> 03:02:21.250]  There's no danger to the national security.
[03:02:21.250 --> 03:02:30.274]  I think it's an insult to the American people and patronizing and contentious to just officially keep, you know, denying this reality.
[03:02:30.274 --> 03:02:34.175]  This, this is the one of the ghostliest parts of our history.
[03:02:34.175 --> 03:02:37.257]  The Kennedy assassination is not taught in schools.
[03:02:37.257 --> 03:02:39.337]  It's one sentence or one paragraph.
[03:02:39.337 --> 03:02:42.679]  You know, it's like very mysterious because it exposes
[03:02:43.359 --> 03:02:53.507]  Who we are, this national security state that can kill a president, get away with it, brainwash a good deal of the public, and shame those that question it.
[03:02:53.507 --> 03:03:02.134]  You know, it's a classic German, and I hate to keep doing this, but it's classic propaganda where, you know, the big lie
[03:03:02.614 --> 03:03:04.295]  You know, it's a cliche, but it's true.
[03:03:04.295 --> 03:03:08.298]  You know, uh, Goebbels said, you know, it's easy to control a country.
[03:03:08.298 --> 03:03:13.000]  All you have to do is invent a threat from the outside and then demonize those who question it.
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:16.483]  I'm paraphrasing, but, you know, and that's what they do.
[03:03:16.483 --> 03:03:18.224]  And they're doing it now.
[03:03:18.224 --> 03:03:20.005]  It's like, it's scary.
[03:03:20.005 --> 03:03:22.847]  This thing about, you know, them busting the whistleblowers.
[03:03:23.647 --> 03:03:25.329]  Is really chilling stuff.
[03:03:25.329 --> 03:03:30.233]  Because everyone thought, oh well, Obama's not going to be, you know, like Bush or whoever.
[03:03:30.233 --> 03:03:31.734]  There's only one party.
[03:03:31.734 --> 03:03:33.956]  It's the, you know, it's the Republicans.
[03:03:33.956 --> 03:03:39.221]  Oh yeah, and I mean, Obama is going after the press like no president's ever done.
[03:03:39.221 --> 03:03:44.446]  And going after government people that expose, you know, stealing money.
[03:03:44.446 --> 03:03:46.408]  And then they go, no, we can steal the money.
[03:03:46.408 --> 03:03:47.429]  You're going to jail.
[03:03:47.429 --> 03:03:47.469]  Or...
[03:03:50.171 --> 03:04:02.667]  Your analogy of that bank that got busted for laundering money and they paid a little fine was like if your eye went in and held up a bank and got five million and they said, all right, give us a hundred grand and we'll let you go.
[03:04:02.667 --> 03:04:03.187]  Exactly.
[03:04:03.187 --> 03:04:04.008]  But we did the math.
[03:04:04.008 --> 03:04:04.809]  It was that.
[03:04:05.700 --> 03:04:09.181]  It was something like the equivalent, I think, of $3,000 out of a million.
[03:04:09.181 --> 03:04:16.323]  If you stole a million, it was, uh, it was Wachovia and Wells Fargo, $378 billion in laundered money, and they paid a $101 million fine.
[03:04:16.323 --> 03:04:17.063]  That's a joke.
[03:04:17.063 --> 03:04:17.584]  It's a, it's a joke.
[03:04:25.982 --> 03:04:26.423]  And, um...
[03:04:40.902 --> 03:04:41.242]  Absolutely.
[03:04:41.242 --> 03:04:41.823]  Hey, stay there.
[03:04:41.823 --> 03:04:43.324]  I'm going to come back to one more segment with you.
[03:04:43.324 --> 03:04:44.545]  Because I promised to go to Richard.
[03:04:44.545 --> 03:04:46.247]  We're going to talk about gun control.
[03:04:46.247 --> 03:04:47.087]  Alex in Louisiana.
[03:04:47.087 --> 03:04:48.368]  The rest of us are filming police.
[03:04:48.368 --> 03:04:50.210]  Chad in Iowa.
[03:04:50.210 --> 03:04:51.071]  David in Colorado.
[03:04:51.071 --> 03:04:51.711]  And Nick in Connecticut.
[03:04:51.711 --> 03:04:53.513]  We're going to just take those five, six calls.
[03:04:53.513 --> 03:04:54.093]  And that's it.
[03:04:54.093 --> 03:04:55.955]  Because we're doing the nightly news tonight.
[03:04:55.955 --> 03:04:57.256]  Seven o'clock central.
[03:04:57.256 --> 03:04:58.537]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:58.537 --> 03:04:58.997]  Get the book.
[03:04:58.997 --> 03:04:59.458]  Hit list.
[03:05:01.744 --> 03:05:03.145]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:03.145 --> 03:05:13.812]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.812 --> 03:05:18.275]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:18.275 --> 03:05:21.017]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:21.017 --> 03:05:31.644]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.285 --> 03:05:35.767]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.767 --> 03:05:41.932]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.932 --> 03:05:51.820]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.820 --> 03:05:53.321]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.321 --> 03:05:55.223]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.223 --> 03:05:57.925]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.567 --> 03:06:06.351]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[03:06:06.351 --> 03:06:09.374]  I want you to know some very important information.
[03:06:09.374 --> 03:06:18.342]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[03:06:18.342 --> 03:06:23.267]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[03:06:23.895 --> 03:06:35.267]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[03:06:35.267 --> 03:06:42.274]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[03:06:42.934 --> 03:06:47.238]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[03:06:47.238 --> 03:06:50.842]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[03:06:50.842 --> 03:06:58.109]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[03:06:58.109 --> 03:06:59.370]  Protect your immune system.
[03:06:59.370 --> 03:07:00.411]  It's the only one you've got.
[03:07:00.971 --> 03:07:03.314]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[03:07:03.314 --> 03:07:09.943]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them, if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[03:07:09.943 --> 03:07:17.954]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[03:07:18.474 --> 03:07:23.257]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[03:07:23.257 --> 03:07:27.380]  One World Whey is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[03:07:27.380 --> 03:07:35.525]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids, and all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[03:07:35.525 --> 03:07:39.428]  With our TrueCool™ process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[03:07:39.428 --> 03:07:40.448]  My name is Daniel.
[03:07:40.448 --> 03:07:41.649]  I'm 34 years old.
[03:07:41.649 --> 03:07:44.551]  When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[03:07:44.551 --> 03:07:44.611]  Now,
[03:07:46.272 --> 03:07:48.594]  After two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[03:07:48.594 --> 03:07:50.616]  This is my ideal weight.
[03:07:50.616 --> 03:07:57.481]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[03:07:57.481 --> 03:08:01.965]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[03:08:01.965 --> 03:08:04.727]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.727 --> 03:08:07.510]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:08.542 --> 03:08:10.923]  Well, it's terrible news.
[03:08:10.923 --> 03:08:14.605]  But I hope it's a gas main or something not terror-related.
[03:08:14.605 --> 03:08:17.266]  Explosion at the Boston Marathon.
[03:08:17.266 --> 03:08:19.087]  We'll punch up some feeds of this.
[03:08:19.087 --> 03:08:20.528]  We're in overdrive.
[03:08:20.528 --> 03:08:21.088]  We're live.
[03:08:21.088 --> 03:08:23.669]  It's 2-0-8 Central.
[03:08:23.669 --> 03:08:26.510]  And two explosions at Boston Marathon.
[03:08:26.510 --> 03:08:28.692]  People hurt in large explosions.
[03:08:28.692 --> 03:08:30.752]  Oh, man.
[03:08:30.752 --> 03:08:31.553]  Oh, my gosh.
[03:08:31.553 --> 03:08:34.594]  And that old... Are they going to blame it on Iran?
[03:08:34.594 --> 03:08:35.675]  Blame it on the Patriot group?
[03:08:36.750 --> 03:08:36.930]  Are you
[03:08:54.349 --> 03:09:10.426]  At the airport, then it's the mall, then it's the sports stadium, then it's the hotel, then it's the highway, then it's the bus station, this is already in Austin, then it's Army at the Kite Festival, then it's, oh, any event has to have, you know, troops at it.
[03:09:11.365 --> 03:09:13.207]  Two explosions at Boston Marathon.
[03:09:13.207 --> 03:09:15.689]  CNN producer, people hurt in large explosions.
[03:09:15.689 --> 03:09:17.752]  Obviously, nightly news tonight.
[03:09:17.752 --> 03:09:19.614]  Nightly news tonight.
[03:09:19.614 --> 03:09:21.836]  We'll have more details on this 7 o'clock central.
[03:09:21.836 --> 03:09:23.538]  I'm so sick of this.
[03:09:23.538 --> 03:09:29.784]  You know, Richard Belzer, journalist, best-selling author, researcher, movie star, TV star.
[03:09:30.985 --> 03:09:32.006]  It's kind of a side job.
[03:09:32.006 --> 03:09:34.428]  He's got a new book out, Hit List.
[03:09:34.428 --> 03:09:46.159]  Knowing how much they use false flags, and of course, I should give people the website, it's bellsorbook.com or ibellz.com, like ibellz.com, i-b-e-l-z.com.
[03:09:46.159 --> 03:09:49.462]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com, author of I'm Not a Cop.
[03:09:50.563 --> 03:09:58.891]  And any other co-authored how to be a stand-up comic and dead wrong his most recently hit list and He joins us right now.
[03:09:58.891 --> 03:10:00.552]  He's a talk show us as well.
[03:10:00.552 --> 03:10:06.918]  He's on everything So oh and in the film he was oh wait a minute Belzer.
[03:10:06.918 --> 03:10:07.959]  I'm gonna show my ignorance
[03:10:08.959 --> 03:10:10.679]  You were in Scarface?
[03:10:10.679 --> 03:10:11.340]  Oh, yeah.
[03:10:11.340 --> 03:10:14.720]  I was on stage at the Babylon Club when they... No, no, that's right!
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:18.361]  It's Hiding in Plain View when they try to kill Tony.
[03:10:18.361 --> 03:10:22.362]  And you're going, everybody, let's give it to... and they're making fun of Cubans.
[03:10:22.362 --> 03:10:22.902]  Right.
[03:10:22.902 --> 03:10:25.102]  Oh, my gosh, you're even cooler.
[03:10:25.102 --> 03:10:27.623]  Oh, my, now I'm really jealous.
[03:10:27.623 --> 03:10:29.283]  Oh, man, it's one of my favorite movies.
[03:10:29.283 --> 03:10:30.803]  And of course you're in that.
[03:10:30.803 --> 03:10:31.863]  Of course you're in that.
[03:10:31.863 --> 03:10:33.144]  Yeah, that's you.
[03:10:33.144 --> 03:10:34.444]  That's me with my Reagan hair.
[03:10:35.939 --> 03:10:36.599]  Oh my gosh.
[03:10:36.599 --> 03:10:46.424]  Anyways, uh... You mentioned before about what we have to keep our eye on in this marathon story is the very first official reaction.
[03:10:46.424 --> 03:10:47.664]  Yeah, guys, save these recordings.
[03:10:47.664 --> 03:10:48.425]  Save all the recordings.
[03:10:48.425 --> 03:10:49.565]  Record everywhere.
[03:10:49.565 --> 03:10:50.265]  What?
[03:10:50.265 --> 03:10:51.526]  I'm telling the crew, record everywhere.
[03:10:52.796 --> 03:10:57.499]  Yeah, how are they going to paint this?
[03:10:57.499 --> 03:10:59.661]  I'm working with veterans now.
[03:10:59.661 --> 03:11:17.914]  I convinced the show I'm on, Law and Order, Special Victims Unit, to do an episode about a vet who had PTSD and they tried to disparage him on the stand because he was having flashbacks and stuff.
[03:11:17.914 --> 03:11:21.196]  But he gathered himself and helped us convict someone.
[03:11:21.616 --> 03:11:37.687]  So, because I wanted to make the vet the hero, because when these kids come home, and they are a lot of them kids, and their lives, their limbs, you know, they're shattered, you know, we robbed their money, they had tons of paperwork, you know, it's really obscene.
[03:11:37.687 --> 03:11:45.412]  And when there was a shooting, there was a vet with shots, they said, oh, he's got PTSD.
[03:11:45.412 --> 03:11:47.654]  Nobody with PTSD is shooting anybody.
[03:11:47.654 --> 03:11:50.396]  That disease does not make people shoot people.
[03:11:51.756 --> 03:11:57.479]  Well, they're training the police that vets will target every police department and prepare for this war.
[03:11:57.479 --> 03:12:03.361]  And you know, like I said, Nazi Germany targeted Jews, the Russians targeted other people, the Kulaks, the farmers.
[03:12:03.361 --> 03:12:08.383]  Have you seen all these reports where now Homeland Security says the new enemy is going to be mainline Christians?
[03:12:08.383 --> 03:12:10.463]  I mean, it's so absurd.
[03:12:10.463 --> 03:12:14.105]  It's Drudge now running the headline, explosions at Boston Marathon.
[03:12:14.885 --> 03:12:19.128]  And the Boston Globe, all they have is a Twitter out.
[03:12:19.128 --> 03:12:22.271]  Boston and New England's leading news source.
[03:12:22.271 --> 03:12:24.492]  Green Line due to police activity.
[03:12:24.492 --> 03:12:26.954]  GL terminating.
[03:12:26.954 --> 03:12:32.198]  And it goes multiple people injured, at least a dozen injured after explosion.
[03:12:32.198 --> 03:12:36.301]  Man, I hope this isn't a false flag or a real terror attack, Richard.
[03:12:36.301 --> 03:12:38.322]  No, I hope not.
[03:12:38.322 --> 03:12:41.284]  But, you know, they're going to use it
[03:12:42.185 --> 03:12:47.850]  Even if it's innocent, they will use it because everyone's focused on it now.
[03:12:47.850 --> 03:12:54.315]  And people can be controlled when they're all on the same emotion at the same time.
[03:12:54.315 --> 03:12:58.719]  You know, the government's been studying this since, you know, World War I, how to manipulate us.
[03:12:58.719 --> 03:12:59.199]  Exactly.
[03:12:59.199 --> 03:13:03.383]  Nobody's supposed to be upset about all the murder and death going on with the globalists.
[03:13:03.383 --> 03:13:07.987]  They unfreeze our emotions, though, at certain times and tell us when we're supposed to get upset.
[03:13:08.707 --> 03:13:13.531]  That's so exactly classic, you know, mind control.
[03:13:13.531 --> 03:13:15.512]  And, you know, people used to call me crazy.
[03:13:15.512 --> 03:13:24.439]  But, you know, in 1954, they had a thing, Operation Mockingbird, where they were figuring out how to see through your television.
[03:13:24.439 --> 03:13:25.941]  Okay, 1954.
[03:13:25.941 --> 03:13:27.702]  So what do you think they do now?
[03:13:27.702 --> 03:13:33.807]  I mean, they probably have, you know, cameras in our bathrooms to see what we excrete, and then arrest us.
[03:13:36.238 --> 03:13:41.623]  Let's just fade up the Communist News Channel, more like the Corporate News Channel.
[03:13:41.623 --> 03:13:42.984]  Let's fade this up.
[03:13:42.984 --> 03:13:56.997]  There's a whole process underway right now, but the reality of the situation is it is almost impossible to protect an event, especially one that is over a protracted space, as a marathon is.
[03:13:56.997 --> 03:14:00.280]  And, you know, I hate to say it, but these are the times that we live in.
[03:14:00.980 --> 03:14:03.621]  Richard, that's what they're saying on CNN.
[03:14:03.621 --> 03:14:05.881]  So they're already basically saying it's a terror attack.
[03:14:05.881 --> 03:14:07.341]  Oh my goodness.
[03:14:07.341 --> 03:14:09.162]  We're helpless is what he's saying.
[03:14:09.162 --> 03:14:10.942]  That's so they can control us more.
[03:14:10.942 --> 03:14:14.943]  Now Alex, I think I mentioned this last time I was on, but it bears repeating.
[03:14:14.943 --> 03:14:23.885]  During the Iraq War, PSYOP officers from Fort Detrick, Maryland, were in CNN every day, writing copy.
[03:14:24.921 --> 03:14:29.963]  Approving stories and shaping the, you know, the vision of the war.
[03:14:29.963 --> 03:14:32.405]  So I'm sure, you know, they never went over.
[03:14:32.405 --> 03:14:34.005]  They say, well, that was just that.
[03:14:34.005 --> 03:14:35.066]  They're still there.
[03:14:35.066 --> 03:14:39.368]  You know, this is, you know, well, you know what I'm talking about.
[03:14:39.368 --> 03:14:39.748]  No, no, no.
[03:14:39.748 --> 03:14:42.850]  That even came out in the Washington Post and I talk about it and people don't believe me.
[03:14:45.128 --> 03:14:47.769]  World Net Daily and Washington Post broke it at the time.
[03:14:47.769 --> 03:14:50.491]  World Net Daily first forced Washington Post.
[03:14:50.491 --> 03:14:52.852]  And of course, Drudge carried it way back then.
[03:14:52.852 --> 03:14:59.115]  And of course, have you seen the White House Chief Advisor to Obama saying how horrible Drudge is because they can't control the narratives?
[03:14:59.115 --> 03:15:01.116]  I mean, they're worried about one website.
[03:15:01.116 --> 03:15:05.718]  I think that's the good news, is it shows that the Emperor is wearing no clothes.
[03:15:05.718 --> 03:15:13.142]  If they're worried about DrudgeReport.com, if they're worried about Richard Belzer, they're worried about Alex Jones, they're worried about all of us not following along.
[03:15:13.342 --> 03:15:15.964]  We just saw a video, by the way, for radio listeners.
[03:15:15.964 --> 03:15:22.728]  It's CNN showing cell phone footage already uploaded, showing what looks like a pretty good size explosion and smoke.
[03:15:22.728 --> 03:15:24.610]  And they're saying at least a dozen.
[03:15:24.610 --> 03:15:25.630]  Oh, this looks really bad.
[03:15:25.630 --> 03:15:27.292]  Looks like somebody blew up bleachers.
[03:15:27.292 --> 03:15:27.732]  Oh, no.
[03:15:28.693 --> 03:15:30.834]  Oh my God, I'm so sick of this.
[03:15:30.834 --> 03:15:33.955]  And there's no word on who's claiming responsibility?
[03:15:33.955 --> 03:15:35.495]  Who knows, but I know this.
[03:15:35.495 --> 03:15:38.276]  They got TSA ready to roll out nationwide.
[03:15:38.276 --> 03:15:41.337]  They're already doing it, but they've been... I've talked to insiders.
[03:15:41.337 --> 03:15:44.838]  They're going to be everywhere now, just federal checkpoints.
[03:15:44.838 --> 03:15:48.619]  I mean, can you believe this is... as if you're going to stop anybody that wants to bomb something.
[03:15:49.099 --> 03:15:56.330]  Well, I'm actually getting a little sick to my stomach because when he said, you know, unfortunately these are the times we live in.
[03:15:56.330 --> 03:16:04.302]  So then when we see soldiers at our kids' Little League game, we see soldiers, you know, everywhere.
[03:16:05.083 --> 03:16:06.804]  Well, we're supposed to feel safe?
[03:16:06.804 --> 03:16:07.305]  Exactly.
[03:16:07.305 --> 03:16:09.806]  Notice how they've been already acclimating.
[03:16:09.806 --> 03:16:12.708]  Notice how they've already been in the news going.
[03:16:12.708 --> 03:16:15.370]  And soldiers are now at the kite festivals.
[03:16:15.370 --> 03:16:16.811]  They're at barbecues.
[03:16:16.811 --> 03:16:19.212]  They're searching people.
[03:16:19.212 --> 03:16:23.415]  And I've been telling people they're getting ready to hit soft targets all over the country.
[03:16:23.415 --> 03:16:24.736]  People say, well, who's the main...
[03:16:26.617 --> 03:16:28.698]  Well, who stands to gain?
[03:16:28.698 --> 03:16:36.943]  When the government and the shadow government has been gearing up to roll out and be our savior, and they stand to gain from it, it's obvious.
[03:16:36.943 --> 03:16:45.148]  I mean, who's the number one suspect in this, Richard Belzer, as a journalist, as a crime writer in the past?
[03:16:45.148 --> 03:16:51.012]  Whoever the suspect is, the government will appropriate it and create a narrative.
[03:16:52.189 --> 03:17:04.500]  And 90% of it probably, I'm just guessing, will be a fabrication to shape our thought of police and military and safety and they're licking their chops.
[03:17:04.500 --> 03:17:09.224]  Even if this was a gas main, they still got to study how we reacted.
[03:17:09.904 --> 03:17:15.127]  And that's what they're, you know, that's why even, you know, events that they don't do, they study.
[03:17:15.127 --> 03:17:17.608]  Yeah, I mean, it could have been a truck running over a gas main.
[03:17:17.608 --> 03:17:21.991]  I mean, all the time I see in the paper, gas main blows up, kills 30 people.
[03:17:21.991 --> 03:17:23.111]  It's not even in the news.
[03:17:23.111 --> 03:17:25.693]  It's like back of the paper, you know, barely a blur.
[03:17:25.693 --> 03:17:31.576]  But, but I guarantee you, if five people die from this, all you'll hear is Pelmel Pavlovian.
[03:17:31.576 --> 03:17:33.537]  Be scared of the random man.
[03:17:33.537 --> 03:17:34.037]  Be scared.
[03:17:34.037 --> 03:17:35.398]  Only we can save you.
[03:17:35.398 --> 03:17:38.400]  I mean, just the response shows how fake all this is.
[03:17:38.800 --> 03:17:58.592]  Yeah, you know, I'm going to predict that the hook for them is going to be, these are the times we live in, you know, and everyone will just surrender and let them, you know, uh... How much do you want to bet if you tune into all five networks, they're going to be saying, these are the times we live in, these are the times, exactly, they've always got something like, we've got to give all our rights up now, this is the end of America as we knew it, 9-11.
[03:17:58.592 --> 03:17:59.252]  Why?
[03:17:59.252 --> 03:18:03.215]  Why give up all my rights because of another made-up narrative?
[03:18:04.079 --> 03:18:12.526]  Yeah, and you know, it's interesting because clearly there are bad people, but there aren't millions of them, or even thousands.
[03:18:12.526 --> 03:18:13.087]  You know what I mean?
[03:18:13.087 --> 03:18:18.011]  There's probably a few hundred people that are really demonic and crazy and might hurt us.
[03:18:18.011 --> 03:18:28.861]  You don't imprison 310 million people because there's a few hundred, you know, people that are, you know, whatever they are, drug addicts or crazy or, I mean, I don't know, but it's like
[03:18:29.841 --> 03:18:36.423]  We still have to take our shoes off because some plant from our government had this device that wouldn't have taken down the plane anyway.
[03:18:36.423 --> 03:18:37.584]  That's another thing.
[03:18:37.584 --> 03:18:54.910]  Even the New York Times and even the Washington Globe of all places have done reports the last few years about the hundred plus fake FBI deals where they find 75 IQ mentally ill people and then have them build a bomb and say now blow up the Christmas tree just to take over the Christmas coverage.
[03:18:56.031 --> 03:19:06.197]  I mean, I could go out, I would never do it, I don't want them to edit that, and find a mentally ill person, Richard, and for $10,000 have them, you know, drive a bomb wherever I want it.
[03:19:06.197 --> 03:19:09.199]  I mean, the schizophrenic victims are everywhere.
[03:19:09.199 --> 03:19:15.583]  No, that's an excellent point because, you know, they know who to target and who to recruit.
[03:19:15.583 --> 03:19:20.306]  You know, like a lot of people, like you said before, Oswald was probably recruited much sooner
[03:19:21.407 --> 03:19:31.933]  Uh, than we ever suspected, but he was clearly chosen, you know, to be a fake defector, and to have these false IDs, and, you know, he was much... One of them, anyway, was very intelligent.
[03:19:31.933 --> 03:19:36.496]  And the other one may have been, you know, not as... Well, the good news is... Let's do one more segment.
[03:19:36.496 --> 03:19:37.837]  Richard Belzer, our guest.
[03:19:37.837 --> 03:19:43.240]  Uh, and I'm sorry to call it breaking news here, but I'll try to get to you, David, and Colorado, and others.
[03:19:43.240 --> 03:19:44.061]  Uh, man, I tell ya...
[03:19:45.251 --> 03:19:53.418]  All I know is they're like building up, like, get ready for soft target attacks at, at, at, they even said marathons, sporting events, malls.
[03:19:53.418 --> 03:19:56.240]  We've got to search and body scan you at malls.
[03:19:56.240 --> 03:19:58.202]  Get ready, it's gonna happen!
[03:19:58.202 --> 03:20:00.323]  And, and, oh man, this is so out of control.

[03:21:09.147 --> 03:21:12.748]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[03:21:12.748 --> 03:21:19.131]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[03:21:19.131 --> 03:21:21.652]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[03:22:30.169 --> 03:22:31.430]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:31.430 --> 03:22:35.993]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:22:35.993 --> 03:22:41.797]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:22:41.797 --> 03:22:45.439]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:22:45.439 --> 03:22:48.161]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:48.161 --> 03:22:53.224]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:22:53.224 --> 03:22:53.465]  Call 800-686-2237.

[03:23:00.269 --> 03:23:02.670]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[03:23:02.670 --> 03:23:15.697]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[03:23:15.697 --> 03:23:16.198]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[03:23:18.899 --> 03:23:20.860]  Every year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[03:23:20.860 --> 03:23:24.763]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target.
[03:23:24.763 --> 03:23:27.284]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[03:23:27.284 --> 03:23:35.289]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[03:23:35.849 --> 03:23:41.552]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[03:23:41.552 --> 03:23:45.134]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[03:23:45.134 --> 03:23:45.454]  That's 877-532-5388.
[03:23:45.454 --> 03:23:46.855]  Or go to faketv.com.
[03:23:46.855 --> 03:23:48.595]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[03:24:13.396 --> 03:24:15.498]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done?
[03:24:29.318 --> 03:24:38.300]  I mean, and just wait, like I said at the start of the show, until they start shooting down aircraft with the 10,000 heat-seeking missiles given to them by our government when they took over Libya.
[03:24:38.300 --> 03:24:41.361]  I mean, and ladies and gentlemen, I'm looking at Twitter photos.
[03:24:41.361 --> 03:24:44.141]  If you've got children in the room, don't watch our video stream.
[03:24:44.141 --> 03:24:46.622]  People's arms, legs blown off.
[03:24:46.622 --> 03:24:47.982]  In fact, take down the M4's logo.
[03:24:47.982 --> 03:24:51.423]  You can see that guy with his face blown off and his leg blown off at the hip.
[03:24:52.526 --> 03:24:53.346]  Oh my God.
[03:24:53.346 --> 03:24:54.587]  That's war, folks.
[03:24:54.587 --> 03:25:00.629]  When a predator drops a thousand pound bomb on a village, you'll have hundreds of people like soup.
[03:25:00.629 --> 03:25:03.971]  They did that to the Branch Davidians as well with a shape charge.
[03:25:03.971 --> 03:25:09.373]  So, now remember when they kill innocent people, they dehumanize them and don't even talk about it.
[03:25:09.373 --> 03:25:14.835]  And CNN and stuff won't show, you know, gun pod, helicopter footage of families getting shot.
[03:25:14.835 --> 03:25:17.156]  You put that on YouTube, they take down your account.
[03:25:17.156 --> 03:25:19.637]  But this, they'll be putting all this out.
[03:25:21.028 --> 03:25:24.332]  And you can see from helicopter the blood everywhere.
[03:25:24.332 --> 03:25:39.088]  So what it looks like is, across the street from the bleachers in another seating area, or where a group of hundreds of people were standing to watch, somebody detonated multiple bombs, turning people into what looks like giant troughs of sloppy Joes.
[03:25:39.628 --> 03:25:41.229]  And I'm sorry to have to give details here.
[03:25:41.229 --> 03:25:41.770]  Look at that.
[03:25:41.770 --> 03:25:43.551]  Oh my gosh.
[03:25:43.551 --> 03:25:46.933]  It actually knocked people over 50, 60 yards away.
[03:25:46.933 --> 03:25:49.215]  Looks like it had some shrapnel involved in it.
[03:25:49.215 --> 03:25:51.096]  You can see runners blown over.
[03:25:51.096 --> 03:25:55.639]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, Richard, let's throw this out.
[03:25:55.639 --> 03:25:57.741]  You know, you've had these prosecutors getting killed.
[03:25:57.741 --> 03:26:05.026]  I said Mexican mafia are white supremacists only because those are the groups that usually, who aren't staged, who have the will to kill people.
[03:26:06.567 --> 03:26:10.090]  But with this, Muslim extremists they're going to pin it on?
[03:26:10.090 --> 03:26:12.012]  Or will they pin it on the new enemy, the Patriots?
[03:26:12.012 --> 03:26:12.972]  Go ahead.
[03:26:12.972 --> 03:26:17.737]  Well, they have a menu of what will best serve their needs.
[03:26:17.737 --> 03:26:18.717]  I'm with you.
[03:26:18.717 --> 03:26:23.281]  I pray that it's not like Al-Qaeda, who we invented.
[03:26:23.281 --> 03:26:27.525]  You know, Osama bin Laden did not use the term Al-Qaeda until after 9-11.
[03:26:28.746 --> 03:26:35.668]  It was invented by us to use the RICO statute to ensnare him in some legal case.
[03:26:35.668 --> 03:26:38.208]  So he was never a mastermind.
[03:26:38.208 --> 03:26:38.948]  They just used him.
[03:26:38.948 --> 03:26:40.849]  He would fund different groups.
[03:26:40.849 --> 03:26:46.430]  Al Qaeda is a myth that we use, as is the Muslim Brotherhood is scarier because they're real Nazis.
[03:26:46.430 --> 03:26:49.691]  The British foreign minister said that and they killed him like a week later.
[03:26:49.691 --> 03:26:52.271]  He said it's the name of a code name in a CIA database.
[03:26:52.271 --> 03:26:53.712]  Bin Laden works for us.
[03:26:53.712 --> 03:26:55.092]  Boom, heart attack, week later.
[03:26:56.048 --> 03:26:56.848]  When was that?
[03:26:56.848 --> 03:26:57.809]  That was Robin Cook.
[03:26:57.809 --> 03:26:58.589]  I'm going from memory.
[03:26:58.589 --> 03:26:59.590]  Robin Cook.
[03:26:59.590 --> 03:27:00.570]  Yes, that's right.
[03:27:00.570 --> 03:27:01.851]  That's right.
[03:27:01.851 --> 03:27:13.255]  And so when you tell me that it seems like it was detonated from a different place, this is not an amateur, Alex.
[03:27:13.255 --> 03:27:15.436]  This was no amateur job.
[03:27:15.436 --> 03:27:23.019]  This was meant as an act of terror, either by our government or real terrorists or rogue elements within our government.
[03:27:23.019 --> 03:27:23.720]  You know, it's just
[03:27:24.600 --> 03:27:27.201]  Here we are, you know, speculating on what it is.
[03:27:27.201 --> 03:27:38.027]  We're suspending our natural, instinctive desires and lives and not thinking about sustenance or our families or anything or anything spiritual.
[03:27:38.027 --> 03:27:41.309]  We're thinking about these limbs and people being exploded.
[03:27:41.309 --> 03:27:44.791]  And it makes us focus in now on all the fear.
[03:27:44.791 --> 03:27:47.532]  You know, they've got to go ahead and take our guns.
[03:27:47.532 --> 03:27:50.714]  What if a terrorist goes to the Boston Marathon with guns next?
[03:27:51.855 --> 03:27:54.999]  Uh, oh my goodness, this is just unbelievable.
[03:27:54.999 --> 03:27:59.646]  Uh, and I mean, have you seen the footage yet of people exploding?
[03:27:59.646 --> 03:28:03.352]  No, I'm afraid to, frankly.
[03:28:03.352 --> 03:28:05.054]  It's going to make me sick.
[03:28:05.054 --> 03:28:06.416]  Because I know that
[03:28:07.357 --> 03:28:14.880]  In addition to the human suffering, people, human beings, you know, and that's another thing about the Kennedy assassination, a man was killed that day.
[03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:17.140]  You know, sometimes we lose sight of the fact.
[03:28:17.140 --> 03:28:24.623]  But, you know, human beings have been mangled, and we're all human, so collectively we're going to react to it.
[03:28:24.623 --> 03:28:27.784]  And so for guys like us, it's doubly sickening.
[03:28:29.164 --> 03:28:37.026]  Just alone as a human, the humanity of it, but we know that it's going to be used in some way or may have been perpetrated in some way.
[03:28:37.026 --> 03:28:39.806]  You know, that's what makes us twice as sick as the rest of the world.
[03:28:39.806 --> 03:28:46.868]  Yeah, I would actually be happy if it was a random person and it actually came out because that's not as scary as a big organized government.
[03:28:46.868 --> 03:28:51.529]  The media always says, Alex says the government did it because that's not as scary as random people.
[03:28:51.809 --> 03:28:59.432]  No, what's scary is that a big, powerful organization's doing it, and then posing as the savior, and getting caught doing it over and over again.
[03:28:59.432 --> 03:29:10.876]  I mean, you talk about Vietnam, in those years from 59 until 64, it's been declassified, hundreds of bombings in the country to be blamed on the communists.
[03:29:10.876 --> 03:29:18.159]  And again, I'm no fan of the communists, because they did stuff like that too, but it's just like, governments just do this, folks.
[03:29:19.164 --> 03:29:28.284]  Well, you know, the Hoover got rid of the FBI because there was a black FBI agent within it that helped bring it down.
[03:29:28.284 --> 03:29:29.527]  Hoover helped Eisenhower.
[03:29:30.334 --> 03:29:36.076]  The head of the American Communist Party, I'm not a fan of the communists either, but he was in the FBI.
[03:29:36.076 --> 03:29:39.756]  Every organization, that's why you have to be careful.
[03:29:39.756 --> 03:29:50.839]  A lot of organizations... I'll tell you what, finish your point on the other side, I'm going overdrive this whole hour, and I'll be live tonight, we're doing InfoWars Nightly News, live, and then we'll have the packages after, 7 o'clock central.
[03:29:50.839 --> 03:29:53.940]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.940 --> 03:29:57.421]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.900 --> 03:30:03.301]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

[03:32:01.254 --> 03:32:03.936]  What's safer and cheaper than prescription drugs?

[03:32:05.177 --> 03:32:07.539]  The answer is renovation teas.
[03:32:07.539 --> 03:32:11.742]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.

[03:32:16.045 --> 03:32:19.267]  Renovation tea is especially unique, and here's why.

[03:33:35.836 --> 03:33:44.007]  But I feel like I should wipe these calls clean, even though they've been holding some of them for an hour, to open the phones up for people in Boston.
[03:33:44.007 --> 03:33:49.274]  So what I want John Harmon to do is get these callers' number right now.
[03:33:50.768 --> 03:33:53.529]  And we will call them back tomorrow or later.
[03:33:53.529 --> 03:34:04.415]  We're going to go ahead and go live for at least two more hours today with the video streams at PrisonPlanet.tv and the audio streams at InfoWars.com.
[03:34:04.415 --> 03:34:08.878]  We're going to go ahead and go live and we're going to have Jakari Jackson and David Knight in here.
[03:34:09.995 --> 03:34:13.557]  Live to take your phone calls and more.
[03:34:13.557 --> 03:34:17.379]  We'll get a couple video reports ready at the start of the next hour.
[03:34:17.379 --> 03:34:18.579]  We're going to go commercial free.
[03:34:18.579 --> 03:34:21.120]  We need a break while they get in here and get ready.
[03:34:21.120 --> 03:34:24.162]  And then they can also recap and we'll be feeding them news as it breaks.
[03:34:24.162 --> 03:34:28.064]  And then I'll be able to tell you more at seven o'clock central tonight.
[03:34:28.064 --> 03:34:32.706]  I will host InfoWars Nightly News Live, which we've done.
[03:34:35.035 --> 03:34:36.276]  40, 50 times or so.
[03:34:36.276 --> 03:34:37.918]  So we've done it quite a bit.
[03:34:37.918 --> 03:34:40.300]  Like we had like a whole month where it was live every night.
[03:34:40.300 --> 03:34:43.643]  So because we're considering live show versus tape show, sometimes it's a mix.
[03:34:43.643 --> 03:34:46.485]  A bunch of special reports and stuff tonight.
[03:34:46.485 --> 03:34:52.190]  Again, I've been telling everybody this in the last few months, and longtime listeners know this.
[03:34:52.190 --> 03:34:53.491]  You notice I've turned the heat up.
[03:34:53.491 --> 03:34:54.973]  I've gotten more aggressive.
[03:34:54.973 --> 03:34:56.574]  I've said I'm committed.
[03:34:56.574 --> 03:35:00.558]  And I've also told you, and I've told my wife and the whole crew this, I've never
[03:35:01.807 --> 03:35:03.008]  Never.
[03:35:03.008 --> 03:35:03.568]  Never.
[03:35:03.568 --> 03:35:04.729]  It's not even anxiety.
[03:35:04.729 --> 03:35:16.318]  It's just absolute... The feeling I had a few times in my life where somebody was about to walk around a corner out of the blue and mug me, and you're just like, why do I feel so bummed out?
[03:35:16.318 --> 03:35:18.139]  Why do I feel like there's danger?
[03:35:18.139 --> 03:35:19.680]  And then there it is.
[03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:22.442]  Or you wake up one day and you're driving to work and you go, man, why do I feel weird?
[03:35:22.442 --> 03:35:28.446]  And then you see cars run into each other and kids flying out, you know, on the Dallas Central Expressway.
[03:35:28.446 --> 03:35:29.747]  I've unfortunately probably seen
[03:35:30.974 --> 03:35:32.235]  Seven or eight.
[03:35:32.235 --> 03:35:33.756]  I start thinking about it more.
[03:35:33.756 --> 03:35:35.758]  Fatality crashes in my life.
[03:35:35.758 --> 03:35:39.320]  I've pulled over when arms are chopped off and blood spring, you know, ten feet in the air.
[03:35:39.320 --> 03:35:42.643]  Oh, God.
[03:35:42.643 --> 03:35:44.804]  And I know that feeling right before it happens.
[03:35:44.804 --> 03:35:46.465]  There is a sixth sense.
[03:35:46.465 --> 03:35:50.528]  Ants, you know, birds, mammals even have more of it.
[03:35:50.528 --> 03:35:51.729]  We've just been taught it isn't there.
[03:35:51.729 --> 03:35:55.312]  And, again, the globalists are killing people all over the world.
[03:35:55.312 --> 03:35:57.734]  And I'm not feeling a disturbance in the force.
[03:35:58.894 --> 03:36:02.155]  You know, to be sarcastic, but that's really, you know, kind of what they're talking about there.
[03:36:02.155 --> 03:36:04.295]  We all have that, that sixth sense.
[03:36:04.295 --> 03:36:15.037]  I have been seeing a massive buildup, not like it's not obvious, billions of bullets, armored vehicles, prepared to arrest the Christians en masse, state police going public saying this is crazy.
[03:36:15.037 --> 03:36:19.558]  I drive around Austin now, we see TSA checkpoints and National Guard.
[03:36:19.558 --> 03:36:25.419]  You know, I can't go to like a succulent event, the city of Austin's succulent event,
[03:36:26.518 --> 03:36:27.458]  I think I forgot about this.
[03:36:27.458 --> 03:36:30.820]  I drove by Zilker Park yesterday.
[03:36:30.820 --> 03:36:35.261]  They were having this succulent plant, type of plant event.
[03:36:35.261 --> 03:36:37.122]  We're going to our guest here.
[03:36:37.122 --> 03:36:39.403]  And I looked and I go, there's troops again.
[03:36:39.403 --> 03:36:42.844]  I mean, I just, just troops everywhere.
[03:36:42.844 --> 03:36:47.025]  Okay, this is a rollout ahead of them taking everybody's bank account.
[03:36:47.025 --> 03:36:50.246]  Let me tell all the idiots out there that want to take other people's Second Amendment.
[03:36:50.246 --> 03:36:51.807]  They're going to take
[03:36:53.055 --> 03:36:55.297]  Your money, too, and everything.
[03:36:55.297 --> 03:36:59.981]  And I guess it's, for me, the realization that I've been right about all this.
[03:36:59.981 --> 03:37:01.102]  Not that it was hard to be right.
[03:37:01.102 --> 03:37:03.584]  It's just... I get why people are in denial.
[03:37:03.584 --> 03:37:06.626]  Because what do you do when faced with evil?
[03:37:06.626 --> 03:37:13.332]  What do you do when it's just galloping and growing and oozing and threatening and killing?
[03:37:13.332 --> 03:37:19.937]  And again, I hope... Now they're saying... They're reporting a bunch of stuff right now, but I mean, it's...
[03:37:21.916 --> 03:37:27.558]  It shows a bunch of piles of bloody people and again, there are, it's not like it's a unicorn.
[03:37:27.558 --> 03:37:28.778]  Unicorns don't exist.
[03:37:28.778 --> 03:37:31.859]  There are real organic terror attacks that happen.
[03:37:31.859 --> 03:37:33.199]  They're very, very rare.
[03:37:33.199 --> 03:37:35.020]  They mainly happen in Israel in places.
[03:37:35.020 --> 03:37:37.520]  You know, when a woman goes on a bus and stabs 14 people.
[03:37:37.520 --> 03:37:39.301]  I mean, that's a crime of passion.
[03:37:39.301 --> 03:37:39.861]  That's real.
[03:37:41.081 --> 03:37:43.722]  Uh, but even most of that stuff has come out.
[03:37:43.722 --> 03:37:48.664]  Israel, you know, created fake Al-Qaeda and stuff whenever they want to be able to take rights or something.
[03:37:48.664 --> 03:37:49.985]  All these governments do it.
[03:37:49.985 --> 03:37:59.429]  The Italian Supreme Court Justice I was just talking about, minutes before it happened, he came out last week and said, Bilderberg's staging terror attacks and here are the documents.
[03:37:59.429 --> 03:38:02.050]  We've got to keep an eye on him.
[03:38:02.050 --> 03:38:03.971]  And Richard, I'm ranting here and I want to go to these calls.
[03:38:03.971 --> 03:38:04.451]  No you're not.
[03:38:04.451 --> 03:38:04.751]  No you're not.
[03:38:06.308 --> 03:38:07.610]  You're on the money.
[03:38:07.610 --> 03:38:09.772]  No, glad you mentioned the Italian.
[03:38:09.772 --> 03:38:12.275]  Let's see what happens to him in the next month or two.
[03:38:12.275 --> 03:38:14.979]  Oh, he's discredited and demonized.
[03:38:14.979 --> 03:38:23.549]  You know, Machiavelli, he said that what you do is you take a person's best quality and attack that.
[03:38:24.440 --> 03:38:30.121]  You know, not like make up something, you know, is so it's like that's what I'm not.
[03:38:30.121 --> 03:38:33.542]  I wasn't a big fan of Kerry, but you know, he did get shot.
[03:38:33.542 --> 03:38:40.743]  He was, you know, he had a uniform on more than Bush did and was in combat, but they made him into a wimp.
[03:38:40.743 --> 03:38:44.624]  You know, it's like you can make people's brains do tricks.
[03:38:44.624 --> 03:38:48.025]  And this thing is exactly like, look at this bad person.
[03:38:48.025 --> 03:38:49.905]  They help children.
[03:38:49.905 --> 03:38:51.425]  That's because they want to grandstand.
[03:38:51.425 --> 03:38:53.446]  You know, they can take anything and spin it.
[03:38:53.446 --> 03:38:53.646]  Yeah.
[03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:56.270]  Yeah, and so we got to be real.
[03:38:56.270 --> 03:39:08.034]  I'm so glad you're staying on because in monitoring this because as I learned with the assassination of John Kennedy, I studied what was said immediately after.
[03:39:09.005 --> 03:39:21.536]  You know, the first 24, 36, 48 hours, there was all kinds of stuff that just went away about multiple shooters and guys running away with guns and, you know, just like and they somehow just scrub all that.
[03:39:21.536 --> 03:39:24.979]  But that's why I'm glad that you know, you have the facility.
[03:39:25.459 --> 03:39:34.507]  And the bullhorn now to cover this event and give the alternative, which now is the real point of view, not the... Well listen, I'll be honest with you.
[03:39:34.507 --> 03:39:36.389]  We're going to go to people in Massachusetts right now.
[03:39:36.389 --> 03:39:38.831]  We're going to open the phones up.
[03:39:38.831 --> 03:39:41.273]  But my point is, I'm going to be honest with you, Richard.
[03:39:42.657 --> 03:39:46.520]  We're going to go look at what our viewers pick up and what they email us.
[03:39:46.520 --> 03:39:52.764]  They will be the ones, our listeners, that are going to analyze kind of like that real collective resistance and brain.
[03:39:52.764 --> 03:40:04.872]  And by seven o'clock tonight, if there are any obvious signs or the system milking it or unification across all channels with talking points immediately, that'll be the telltale sign.
[03:40:04.872 --> 03:40:11.997]  If people can check their DVRs, folks, and notice the exact same scripting minute one, then you know it's...
[03:40:12.677 --> 03:40:14.359]  Key phrases.
[03:40:14.359 --> 03:40:19.384]  Because sometimes there's real events, and different networks will go at different angles, and it turns out it's a real event.
[03:40:19.384 --> 03:40:25.951]  If they're all minute one, the same script, like 9-11 or JFK, you know the fix is in.
[03:40:25.951 --> 03:40:27.473]  Exactly.
[03:40:27.473 --> 03:40:32.678]  And I have, like you said, I hope it... Let us take calls, but I hope it is just some random person and not...
[03:40:34.217 --> 03:40:43.350]  I'm sure you've heard that talking point where they go, they think the government was involved because they want to believe somebody's in control and it's scarier that random people could do this.
[03:40:43.350 --> 03:40:43.790]  What do you mean?
[03:40:43.790 --> 03:40:47.135]  It's a hundred times scarier organized evil.
[03:40:47.135 --> 03:40:47.395]  Yeah.
[03:40:48.652 --> 03:40:51.694]  And random people don't do medical experiments on their own people.
[03:40:51.694 --> 03:40:52.395]  Exactly.
[03:40:52.395 --> 03:40:54.276]  And think how many times our government's done that.
[03:40:54.276 --> 03:41:02.761]  They're not having CNN reports about how scary it is, the thousands of lethal secret tests on little kids, troops, black people.
[03:41:02.761 --> 03:41:03.162]  800-259-9231.
[03:41:03.162 --> 03:41:07.585]  Then we go to the next hour, we'll give out our local number.
[03:41:07.585 --> 03:41:10.046]  It's toll free, but our number here.
[03:41:10.046 --> 03:41:12.728]  And again, our regular phone guy is actually sick today.
[03:41:12.728 --> 03:41:15.730]  We got a bunch of people sick today, so our crew is limited, but we're going to do this.
[03:41:15.730 --> 03:41:17.331]  Great job to the crew, by the way.
[03:41:17.331 --> 03:41:18.152]  You guys are all entering.
[03:41:19.612 --> 03:41:20.333]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:20.333 --> 03:41:21.073]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:21.073 --> 03:41:21.853]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:21.853 --> 03:41:22.894]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:22.894 --> 03:41:28.575]  I just realized it's Patriots Day in Massachusetts and April 19th is the national one.
[03:41:28.575 --> 03:41:29.396]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:29.396 --> 03:41:33.717]  That, that, that bumps up the death con that they're going to blame it on a Patriot group.
[03:41:33.717 --> 03:41:34.478]  Anyways, I'm sorry.
[03:41:34.478 --> 03:41:35.278]  I'm just brainstorming.
[03:41:35.278 --> 03:41:35.598]  No, no, no.
[03:41:35.598 --> 03:41:37.279]  That's very astute.
[03:41:37.279 --> 03:41:38.099]  Well, no, no.
[03:41:38.099 --> 03:41:39.519]  John Bowne just said it.
[03:41:39.519 --> 03:41:42.120]  In fact, that's Patriots Day in Massachusetts where it all started.
[03:41:42.120 --> 03:41:45.381]  And then, and then the 19th is a few days later when the big stuff happened.
[03:41:45.381 --> 03:41:46.162]  Folks, here is the
[03:41:47.304 --> 03:41:48.885]  Here is the toll-free number 800-259-9231.
[03:41:48.885 --> 03:41:53.547]  What have you noticed watching the news?
[03:41:53.547 --> 03:41:58.109]  That's just as important as if you're even in MASH, but particularly if you're in Boston.
[03:41:58.109 --> 03:41:59.910]  I know we have listeners everywhere.
[03:41:59.910 --> 03:42:02.451]  800-259-9231.
[03:42:02.451 --> 03:42:08.454]  Please only call if you have a tidbit of key intel or if you were there or have family that was there.
[03:42:08.454 --> 03:42:09.315]  800-259-9231.
[03:42:09.315 --> 03:42:15.298]  And I pray that those bomb with their legs blown off and their faces blown off survive
[03:42:16.368 --> 03:42:20.250]  And I just pray for everybody, whoever your God is, folks, this is just horrible.
[03:42:20.250 --> 03:42:24.012]  And again, this could be the start of a whole bunch of this stuff, okay?
[03:42:24.012 --> 03:42:31.517]  Because they're saying, the libertarians will start bombing everything, and then if it starts happening and they blame it on us, if it comes out...
[03:42:31.957 --> 03:42:34.658]  And they say it's a libertarian group, folks.
[03:42:34.658 --> 03:42:36.138]  We are in deep crap.
[03:42:36.138 --> 03:42:37.538]  It means they're going ahead with it.
[03:42:37.538 --> 03:42:41.959]  If they say it's Iran, there is no way Iran would pull something like this.
[03:42:41.959 --> 03:42:42.839]  No, they wouldn't.
[03:42:42.839 --> 03:42:45.760]  Knowing that they're going to get clobbered.
[03:42:45.760 --> 03:42:49.580]  My goodness, let's go ahead and talk to Mel in Mass.
[03:42:49.580 --> 03:42:51.641]  You're on the air with Richard Belzer and Alex Jones.
[03:42:51.641 --> 03:42:53.541]  What a day to come on, Richard.
[03:42:53.541 --> 03:42:54.001]  I know.
[03:42:54.001 --> 03:42:56.501]  I mean, it's amazing.
[03:42:56.501 --> 03:42:57.082]  Go ahead, Mel.
[03:42:57.082 --> 03:42:58.122]  You're on the air from Mass.
[03:42:58.122 --> 03:42:59.162]  Where are you in Massachusetts?
[03:43:00.552 --> 03:43:03.395]  I'm in the Worcester area.
[03:43:03.395 --> 03:43:13.449]  I was actually out painting the house and I heard you talk about the marathon and the explosion and I remember I was listening to how you said right away,
[03:43:15.151 --> 03:43:17.412]  They said it's the times we live in.
[03:43:17.412 --> 03:43:23.154]  So I came in, I flipped on the Channel 5, and they described, uh, it's organized chaos.
[03:43:23.154 --> 03:43:24.655]  I mean, where have we had that before?
[03:43:24.655 --> 03:43:32.058]  And, uh, and then they're now, it's almost like they've been listening to your show, because they're like, well, it's too early to say what's going on here.
[03:43:32.298 --> 03:43:33.078]  No, no, it's already begun.
[03:43:33.078 --> 03:43:34.599]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[03:43:34.599 --> 03:43:36.040]  Guys, rewind CNN right now.
[03:43:36.040 --> 03:43:37.300]  Rewind it to that, the minute.
[03:43:37.300 --> 03:43:42.103]  They're now saying, they're now saying, were there right-winger patriot meetings in the area?
[03:43:42.103 --> 03:43:43.363]  Uh-oh.
[03:43:43.363 --> 03:43:44.044]  Uh-oh.
[03:43:44.044 --> 03:43:44.704]  Oh, man.
[03:43:44.704 --> 03:43:47.145]  And that's CNN doing that?
[03:43:47.145 --> 03:43:48.146]  Oh.
[03:43:48.146 --> 03:43:49.886]  Wolf Blitzer, we are in trouble.
[03:43:49.886 --> 03:43:50.787]  Oh, man.
[03:43:50.787 --> 03:43:52.988]  I bet they even dragged me into it with my 1776 line.
[03:43:52.988 --> 03:43:53.288]  And Boston.
[03:43:59.522 --> 03:44:01.104]  I'm sorry Richard, go ahead.
[03:44:01.104 --> 03:44:02.686]  You're right, it's all the symbolism.
[03:44:02.686 --> 03:44:05.630]  Boston, the Tea Party, Patriots Day.
[03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:12.860]  I was saying the whole earlier show that they're going to do a false flag and blame Patriots and I just feel it.
[03:44:15.885 --> 03:44:18.948]  Who loses is who shoots first, like Boston.
[03:44:18.948 --> 03:44:20.829]  And I said, yeah, or Bunker Hill.
[03:44:20.829 --> 03:44:23.912]  But I said, yeah, but they'll shoot first and say we did it.
[03:44:23.912 --> 03:44:24.913]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:44:24.913 --> 03:44:26.935]  They'll shoot first for us, Richard.
[03:44:26.935 --> 03:44:34.021]  Yeah, it's like Hitler would kill Polish soldiers and put German uniforms on them and drag them across the border and then invade the country.
[03:44:34.021 --> 03:44:34.602]  Exactly.
[03:44:34.602 --> 03:44:38.485]  Operation Goliwitz, which was part of Operation Himmler.
[03:44:38.485 --> 03:44:38.966]  Exactly.
[03:44:39.970 --> 03:44:41.131]  Oh man, I'm sick of it.
[03:44:41.131 --> 03:44:47.538]  Boy, I tell ya, let me ask you this, Richard, I don't know if you believe in this, but has your spidey sense been off the chart lately?
[03:44:47.538 --> 03:44:49.941]  Just like, your spidey sense.
[03:44:49.941 --> 03:44:56.488]  You notice early in the day, Matt, any special Patriots Day events going on?
[03:44:56.488 --> 03:44:59.091]  Anything pointing to a special day in Massachusetts?
[03:45:00.100 --> 03:45:02.001]  Well, it's always a special day, Patriots Day.
[03:45:02.001 --> 03:45:06.342]  Everyone gets the day off from work for the most part, and it's two huge events in Boston.
[03:45:06.342 --> 03:45:13.984]  It's not only the Boston Marathon, where 25,000 plus people run, but I believe it's always opening day of Fenway, so you also have that going on.
[03:45:13.984 --> 03:45:20.386]  So it's a traffic nightmare in a way, but it's probably one of the busiest days in downtown Boston.
[03:45:20.386 --> 03:45:26.548]  So it is a holiday, and people, a lot of people don't go to work, and there's no, is there no school today either?
[03:45:26.548 --> 03:45:29.049]  Correct, there's no school on Patriots Day in Massachusetts.
[03:45:29.520 --> 03:45:30.601]  So the kids are home.
[03:45:30.601 --> 03:45:36.204]  They're watching either the marathon or they're watching the Boston Red Sox play over at Fenway Park.
[03:45:36.204 --> 03:45:38.245]  That game is now over.
[03:45:38.245 --> 03:45:44.408]  And notice the bombing happened right where they've got the United Nations display with a bunch of flags.
[03:45:44.408 --> 03:45:47.250]  I'm telling you, Richard, this is looking worse by the minute.
[03:45:47.250 --> 03:45:48.450]  Guys, keep Googling.
[03:45:48.450 --> 03:45:50.812]  Find out if anybody's taking responsibility for this yet.
[03:45:50.812 --> 03:45:51.952]  This is outreach rental.
[03:45:51.952 --> 03:45:55.354]  I'm sorry, Richard, I asked you if your Spidey sense was starting to tingle lately.
[03:45:55.354 --> 03:45:56.355]  Well, I'm glad you asked me.
[03:45:56.755 --> 03:46:14.959]  It's a good metaphor because I was in France for five weeks writing and I just turn off everything and I started getting depressed, not just for the Kennedy thing, but just for the way what I've been learning about the degree to which the government
[03:46:15.619 --> 03:46:27.904]  It really controls even more than I thought, and I think I'm up to date on it, but it got darker and darker, and I started sensing that something's going to happen in this country.
[03:46:27.904 --> 03:46:29.745]  I don't know what it is.
[03:46:29.745 --> 03:46:31.045]  It just seemed inevitable.
[03:46:33.366 --> 03:46:33.666]  I don't
[03:46:53.589 --> 03:46:57.750]  You know, it's making me ill, because they're going to use it no matter who did it.
[03:46:57.750 --> 03:47:01.511]  Exactly, and it can blame it on Muslims, Libertarians, Liberals, who knows?
[03:47:01.511 --> 03:47:06.592]  But how dare Wolf Blitzer pose a question like that?
[03:47:06.592 --> 03:47:11.153]  That's directly from Fort Detrick, I guarantee you, to say, was there any Patriot groups there?
[03:47:11.153 --> 03:47:12.854]  Why couldn't he say, were there any Martians there?
[03:47:12.854 --> 03:47:14.634]  Were there any aliens there?
[03:47:14.634 --> 03:47:18.135]  That's a tell, though, that's a tell!
[03:47:18.135 --> 03:47:18.755]  Come on, man!
[03:47:19.853 --> 03:47:22.255]  I gotta get, oh my god, this is red alert.
[03:47:22.255 --> 03:47:23.437]  Let's see what Drudge is saying.
[03:47:23.437 --> 03:47:28.021]  I'm gonna go back to the caller here and then I'll report on what Drudge is saying with Richard Belzer.
[03:47:28.021 --> 03:47:31.024]  Two explosions developing, reportedly three dead.
[03:47:31.024 --> 03:47:32.445]  Okay, bad news.
[03:47:32.445 --> 03:47:34.868]  DrudgeReport.com is reporting three dead.
[03:47:34.868 --> 03:47:37.130]  People missing limbs, yeah, I've seen that video.
[03:47:37.130 --> 03:47:38.291]  We've been showing it.
[03:47:38.291 --> 03:47:40.814]  So be careful out there if you've got your children with you.
[03:47:40.814 --> 03:47:42.715]  Explosions at Boston Marathon.
[03:47:43.416 --> 03:47:46.919]  And then down here, Californians move to ban and seize guns.
[03:47:46.919 --> 03:47:50.742]  Meanwhile, with gold plunging, what could this signify?
[03:47:50.742 --> 03:47:51.503]  Dow skids 200.
[03:47:51.503 --> 03:47:54.245]  Oh my gosh, oh my.
[03:47:54.245 --> 03:47:58.028]  I'm telling you, I told my wife this morning.
[03:47:58.028 --> 03:47:59.850]  I told the listeners when I went on air today.
[03:47:59.850 --> 03:48:02.272]  I told the crew, I can barely do this show.
[03:48:02.272 --> 03:48:10.459]  I mean, I just, every time, they're about to roll out some PSYOP, and I'm not trying to get into mumbo jumbo here, I just can't help it, Richard.
[03:48:11.345 --> 03:48:19.707]  Well, no, your antenna, you're like me, I mean, my antenna's been buzzing for years, but it seems to be getting red hot.
[03:48:19.707 --> 03:48:24.448]  And a constellation of events is occurring all at the same time.
[03:48:24.448 --> 03:48:31.290]  Now, everything we feared, it used to be a little here, a little there, but now you got, you know, busting the whistleblowers, false flag events.
[03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:41.015]  Uh, the drones, uh, you know, the putting troops in the street, uh, invading our privacy beyond our, you know, they do listen literally.
[03:48:41.015 --> 03:48:42.516]  This is not an exaggeration.
[03:48:42.516 --> 03:48:45.998]  They do listen literally to every single phone call in this country.
[03:48:45.998 --> 03:48:47.139]  And they admit it now!
[03:48:47.139 --> 03:48:49.380]  Just six years ago, Bush got caught lying about it.
[03:48:49.380 --> 03:48:50.381]  It was a scandal.
[03:48:50.381 --> 03:48:52.322]  Now it's like, yeah, we're doing, we're watching everything.
[03:48:52.742 --> 03:48:55.406]  Yeah, he said, we have lawyers that, you know, said it was OK.
[03:48:55.406 --> 03:48:56.467]  Yeah, let's go back to Mel.
[03:48:56.467 --> 03:48:57.408]  Mel, I apologize.
[03:48:57.408 --> 03:48:58.950]  Just that breaking news happened.
[03:48:58.950 --> 03:49:01.774]  What do you think of Wolf Blitzer going, oh, it's Patriot Day.
[03:49:01.774 --> 03:49:04.558]  Was there any Patriot events in the area?
[03:49:04.558 --> 03:49:06.721]  I mean, Mel, I'm telling you, this is looking bad.
[03:49:06.721 --> 03:49:07.362]  Mel, go ahead.
[03:49:08.142 --> 03:49:09.382]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[03:49:09.382 --> 03:49:14.644]  You know, it's funny because I forgot today is Patriots Day.
[03:49:14.644 --> 03:49:17.144]  No, it's the Income Tax Day!
[03:49:17.144 --> 03:49:19.785]  Oh, watch him blame an anti-income tax guy.
[03:49:19.785 --> 03:49:22.685]  And notice, they never actually bomb a real target.
[03:49:22.685 --> 03:49:29.167]  It's always the general public so they can scare us and then act like anti-government groups would actually just target the general public.
[03:49:29.167 --> 03:49:29.427]  Go ahead.
[03:49:30.618 --> 03:49:32.919]  Yeah, you know, I agree with you on that.
[03:49:32.919 --> 03:49:38.441]  And it's just fun, you know, like on 9-11 too, I mean, the planes came from Boston.
[03:49:38.441 --> 03:49:44.603]  This is where, you know, when we came across and left England, this is where we started settling, you know, Plymouth Rock and everything.
[03:49:44.603 --> 03:49:46.184]  It's just, I think it's very symbolic.
[03:49:48.706 --> 03:49:53.711]  That's interesting that you mention that, that the planes took off from Boston, how symbolic Boston is.
[03:49:53.711 --> 03:50:04.962]  Because the guys who dressed up like Native Americans and threw boxes of tea in the water just came out of a Mason meeting.
[03:50:04.962 --> 03:50:12.008]  Man, I tell you, the Green Dragon Inn or Green Dragon Bar, man, I tell you, I'm almost speechless at this point.
[03:50:13.393 --> 03:50:16.136]  Regroup, get the other crew in here after we take some more calls.
[03:50:16.136 --> 03:50:17.677]  Richard, we'll get you out of here in about 6-7 minutes.
[03:50:17.677 --> 03:50:18.758]  Whatever you need, Alex.
[03:50:18.758 --> 03:50:19.139]  Whatever you need.
[03:50:19.139 --> 03:50:22.542]  We're about to go to break, and I've got to go probably just lay down.
[03:50:22.542 --> 03:50:23.062]  Please.
[03:50:23.062 --> 03:50:23.863]  I'm going to.
[03:50:23.863 --> 03:50:24.784]  Yeah, I know.
[03:50:24.784 --> 03:50:29.429]  I'm going to just lay down, reset, and just try to, you know, because here's the deal, guys.
[03:50:29.429 --> 03:50:30.690]  It's the darkness growing.
[03:50:30.690 --> 03:50:32.271]  I mean, you can feel it.
[03:50:34.574 --> 03:50:36.354]  Oh, I tell you, we got a bunch of other news.
[03:50:36.354 --> 03:50:39.495]  CNN, two blasted Boston Marathon have injured six people.
[03:50:39.495 --> 03:50:42.235]  Three dead, they're now reporting.
[03:50:42.235 --> 03:50:45.376]  One of the bombs came from a dumpster-type can by the restaurant.
[03:50:45.376 --> 03:50:46.396]  One was inside a building.
[03:50:46.396 --> 03:50:49.177]  Third possible at a Meridian Hotel.
[03:50:49.177 --> 03:50:52.477]  So, they're now talking about three bombs, at least three dead.
[03:50:52.477 --> 03:50:57.978]  Continual coverage with video feeds at InfoWars.com, PrisonBlinded.com, and DrugsReport.com.
[03:50:57.978 --> 03:51:00.179]  Of course, as usual, the best coverage.
[03:51:01.739 --> 03:51:03.640]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:51:03.640 --> 03:51:07.283]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[03:51:07.283 --> 03:51:11.846]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:51:11.846 --> 03:51:17.950]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:51:17.950 --> 03:51:28.737]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[03:51:28.937 --> 03:51:31.800]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates!
[03:51:31.800 --> 03:51:35.424]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[03:51:35.424 --> 03:51:50.159]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[03:51:50.579 --> 03:52:05.446]  Since disaster can strike at any time, you always need to be prepared.
[03:52:05.446 --> 03:52:07.527]  And not just with an insurance policy.
[03:52:07.527 --> 03:52:11.649]  Superstorm Sandy left thousands of people starving and stranded for weeks.
[03:52:11.649 --> 03:52:14.730]  You need to be prepared with an emergency supply of food.
[03:52:14.730 --> 03:52:19.032]  Now through April 30th, save up to 25% on freeze-dried food.
[03:52:19.032 --> 03:52:20.213]  During the freeze-dry guide,
[03:52:25.998 --> 03:52:26.399]  I think so.
[03:52:41.238 --> 03:52:47.561]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[03:52:47.561 --> 03:52:48.801]  That's closer than you think.
[03:53:10.126 --> 03:53:17.830]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[03:53:17.830 --> 03:53:25.053]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[03:53:25.053 --> 03:53:30.576]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[03:53:31.334 --> 03:53:32.715]  But here's some good news.
[03:53:32.715 --> 03:53:42.203]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[03:53:42.203 --> 03:53:51.471]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[03:53:51.471 --> 03:53:55.674]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[03:53:55.674 --> 03:53:57.176]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[03:54:01.870 --> 03:54:02.875]  I'm good.
[03:54:12.602 --> 03:54:14.923]  Alright, I'm going to say bye to Richard Belzer here in a moment.
[03:54:14.923 --> 03:54:16.723]  We're going to take more calls from Massachusetts.
[03:54:16.723 --> 03:54:18.463]  I'm going to go into 4th hour.
[03:54:18.463 --> 03:54:18.883]  5th hour.
[03:54:18.883 --> 03:54:20.724]  This is the end of the 4th hour.
[03:54:20.724 --> 03:54:25.685]  Completely commercial free audio and video streams at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:25.685 --> 03:54:31.086]  Have the IT folks put a free video stream up for everyone like we did during the election.
[03:54:31.086 --> 03:54:34.627]  We can fire up the PrisonPlanet.tv streams for everybody.
[03:54:34.627 --> 03:54:35.967]  Get Curt Nemo to add it.
[03:54:35.967 --> 03:54:37.688]  I'm going to ask Sha'Carri Jackson and...
[03:54:39.148 --> 03:54:46.770]  And Rob Dewey and crew to host the next three hours with David Knight and then I will go live tonight when we know more at seven o'clock.
[03:54:46.770 --> 03:54:53.332]  We'll go to about five or so with live coverage and then we can gear up to go live at seven o'clock.
[03:54:53.332 --> 03:54:55.853]  And I want that stream given to the web guys free to everybody.
[03:54:55.853 --> 03:54:56.893]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:56.893 --> 03:55:01.695]  We have to pay for the bandwidth folks, but we have enough members and stuff to be able to do that.
[03:55:01.695 --> 03:55:04.096]  I mean, we get like 300,000 people to tune in, I will get a $20,000 bill.
[03:55:05.196 --> 03:55:08.638]  It doesn't matter, I've got to be able to respond to these people.
[03:55:08.638 --> 03:55:13.081]  So be sure and buy books, buy videos, support us, buy the bumper stickers, just all of it.
[03:55:13.081 --> 03:55:14.662]  This is an all-out info war.
[03:55:14.662 --> 03:55:17.524]  And I think people are beginning to understand, the crew's completely freaked out.
[03:55:17.524 --> 03:55:22.947]  Because I walked in here the day before Sandy Hook and I said, something bad's about to happen.
[03:55:22.947 --> 03:55:25.268]  And today I said, I'm physically sick.
[03:55:25.268 --> 03:55:26.929]  I said on air, they're getting ready to blow stuff up.
[03:55:30.157 --> 03:55:40.959]  They're going to do their own shot heard around the world to blame it on us, so like Lexington and Concord, and this is the day it happened, at that place!
[03:55:40.959 --> 03:55:44.640]  I mean, my God!
[03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:49.321]  They'll say Bin Laden blew up the World Trade Center, and they're going to blame it on him, and he'll take the blame.
[03:55:49.321 --> 03:55:50.581]  And I said that July 25th.
[03:55:50.581 --> 03:55:51.842]  I don't know how I know this stuff.
[03:55:51.842 --> 03:55:55.462]  It's like, you know, look at my own 1-800 number and start reading horoscopes or something.
[03:55:55.462 --> 03:55:56.903]  No, I mean, it's not that, folks.
[03:55:56.903 --> 03:55:57.703]  I get their script.
[03:55:58.163 --> 03:55:59.784]  And they may blame it on Muslims anyways.
[03:55:59.784 --> 03:56:01.486]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[03:56:01.486 --> 03:56:03.807]  But right now, it's Patriots Day.
[03:56:03.807 --> 03:56:05.529]  It's April 19th.
[03:56:05.529 --> 03:56:08.150]  Now if you don't pay your money to the Federal Reserve, you're a terrorist.
[03:56:08.150 --> 03:56:15.616]  And Rob Dew talks about his brother-in-law constantly, who he has arguments with, who works for, what is it, the Defense Intelligence Agency?
[03:56:15.616 --> 03:56:16.597]  He's in the Army.
[03:56:16.597 --> 03:56:17.097]  Yeah, I know.
[03:56:17.097 --> 03:56:18.558]  People are going to get mad you're talking about this.
[03:56:18.558 --> 03:56:19.139]  The point is,
[03:56:20.079 --> 03:56:24.804]  I'm just going to hold Richard Belzer over a little bit, too, because I want him to have a final comment, but I'm going to break this down.
[03:56:24.804 --> 03:56:31.911]  Rob Dew, news director, your wife's brother?
[03:56:31.911 --> 03:56:35.454]  Tell people what happened to him today.
[03:56:35.454 --> 03:56:36.676]  He was in command.
[03:56:38.165 --> 03:56:42.027]  Well, he was in command of the military there, because I saw a troop.
[03:56:42.027 --> 03:56:43.148]  Tell me what you told me out there.
[03:56:43.148 --> 03:56:46.049]  I'll tell you what, he was running the race today.
[03:56:46.049 --> 03:56:47.190]  Running the race?
[03:56:47.190 --> 03:56:49.011]  Oh, running it.
[03:56:49.011 --> 03:56:50.772]  I misunderstood it because I saw army there.
[03:56:50.772 --> 03:56:52.713]  He was running in the race.
[03:56:52.713 --> 03:56:53.573]  Okay, got it.
[03:56:53.573 --> 03:56:54.394]  And they had army there.
[03:56:54.394 --> 03:56:58.516]  He went with army in a bus and they were running
[03:56:59.036 --> 03:57:00.477]  Well yeah, I guess I can see how you, Ms.
[03:57:00.477 --> 03:57:08.159]  Katritsky... You just told me this during the break, you're like... Because I knew he ran stuff, I knew he was in intelligence domestically, so then I just got it wrong.
[03:57:08.159 --> 03:57:08.659]  Go ahead.
[03:57:08.659 --> 03:57:14.981]  So he was running the race, and at some point they pulled him from the race and said, you're dehydrated, you need to go to the hospital.
[03:57:14.981 --> 03:57:20.123]  And so they sent him to the hospital, and what my wife told me... Wasn't that nice of them?
[03:57:20.123 --> 03:57:22.524]  Just like Mayor Willie Brown got the call not to fly!
[03:57:23.224 --> 03:57:24.946]  Oh my God!
[03:57:24.946 --> 03:57:34.074]  And his wife told my wife that he's in the hospital now, but he would have been crossing... Just center that camera.
[03:57:34.074 --> 03:57:35.355]  ...that the bombs did go off.
[03:57:35.355 --> 03:57:36.135]  Start over.
[03:57:36.135 --> 03:57:39.899]  I misread what you said and then we're going to get Belzer's take.
[03:57:39.899 --> 03:57:42.441]  We're going to go to break, go commercial break, go back to Belzer.
[03:57:42.441 --> 03:57:43.542]  Start over because I was interrupting.
[03:57:44.892 --> 03:57:48.774]  Because right before you went live and I drug you in here, you go, oh my gosh, I just got off the phone with my wife.
[03:57:48.774 --> 03:57:51.755]  Her brother, he was running the race.
[03:57:51.755 --> 03:57:53.796]  He's in domestic military operations.
[03:57:53.796 --> 03:57:55.437]  He's the guy that I argue with all the time.
[03:57:55.437 --> 03:57:57.398]  And he was going to be right there.
[03:57:57.398 --> 03:57:58.899]  And they made him go to the hospital.
[03:57:58.899 --> 03:58:00.340]  I said, what, they drug him?
[03:58:00.340 --> 03:58:01.800]  Like, oh, he's in command.
[03:58:01.800 --> 03:58:02.881]  Now I get it.
[03:58:02.881 --> 03:58:04.361]  They're like, you need to go.
[03:58:04.361 --> 03:58:04.842]  Right, right.
[03:58:04.842 --> 03:58:08.984]  That's like Mayor Willie Brown told not to fly on 9-11 the day before.
[03:58:08.984 --> 03:58:11.725]  Yeah, it's very... Stay there, stay there.
[03:58:11.725 --> 03:58:13.226]  Richard Belzer, what's your take on that?
[03:58:13.809 --> 03:58:23.433]  Well, I'm rarely speechless, but the fact that they pulled him out means now we know it is a domestic operation.
[03:58:23.433 --> 03:58:26.514]  Oh my God, if he wasn't really sick, did he say he was sick?
[03:58:26.514 --> 03:58:27.254]  That's what I don't know.
[03:58:27.254 --> 03:58:28.015]  They're going to tell him to shut up.
[03:58:28.015 --> 03:58:28.615]  Call him right now.
[03:58:28.615 --> 03:58:29.135]  That's what I don't know.
[03:58:29.135 --> 03:58:29.755]  Call him right now.
[03:58:29.755 --> 03:58:30.136]  All right.
[03:58:30.136 --> 03:58:30.876]  Call him right now.
[03:58:30.876 --> 03:58:31.416]  All right.
[03:58:31.416 --> 03:58:34.257]  Before, I shouldn't even have... This is breaking right now.
[03:58:34.257 --> 03:58:36.278]  I am living in... They're saving their own people.
[03:58:36.278 --> 03:58:37.118]  That's what they do.
[03:58:37.118 --> 03:58:38.819]  Yeah, they save their own people every time.
[03:58:38.819 --> 03:58:40.160]  Oh my God.
[03:58:40.160 --> 03:58:40.680]  Unbelievable.
