[00:00:00.684 --> 00:00:00.869]  Yeah.
[00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:18.326]  Operation Paul Revere, the largest film contest out there right now.
[00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:24.673]  $115,000 in cash prizes, as well as an opportunity to get before a huge audience.
[00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:30.399]  If you're a film professional, this is your chance to get to hundreds of thousands of people on just our YouTube channel.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.622]  Right now I've got with us Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:35.425]  Alex, tell us a little bit about what you're trying to do with this film contest.
[00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:43.769]  Well, David, about a month ago we launched this, and it's got a small window of three months, because tyranny has taken over this country.
[00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:56.074]  And whatever your idea of liberty is out there, we want you to make a short film, or it could even be a long film, the rules are at InfoWars.com forward slash contest, to resist this tyranny.
[00:00:56.494 --> 00:01:00.157]  That's why we're calling it Operation Paul Revere.
[00:01:00.837 --> 00:01:04.861]  And you could be what you call a liberal, a conservative, a constitutionalist, a libertarian.
[00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:06.522]  It could be a three-minute piece.
[00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:07.623]  It could be a two-hour piece.
[00:01:07.663 --> 00:01:10.945]  It could be fiction, nonfiction, drama, a musical.
[00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:14.048]  We want to just encourage that dynamic.
[00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:22.432]  Human spirit to get involved and to go out there and warn and awaken people to become politically involved themselves.
[00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:33.617]  So we're trying to initiate brush fires in the minds of men and women out there in the animating contest for liberty to get them to cause a chain reaction to get other people to do it as well.
[00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:34.538]  And the goal is
[00:01:35.838 --> 00:01:46.804]  Get hundreds and hundreds of great pieces out there, great art, great research to get people thinking, and then to have three winners, $100,000 for first place, $10,000 for second, $5,000 for third.
[00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:58.430]  But then out of that group of winners and runners up, we can then communicate with people and hire a crew to make two or three different films a year.
[00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:00.531]  We're good to go.
[00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:23.143]  Right, right.
[00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:43.289]  So aggressive.
[00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.273]  And there's two months for people to put their film out.
[00:02:47.373 --> 00:02:52.479]  And regardless, we're going to be featuring excerpts of it here on The Nightly News that reaches hundreds of thousands a week.
[00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.562]  We're going to be featuring excerpts on the radio show Slash TV.
[00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:58.005]  It's also television that reaches three million a day.
[00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:02.990]  We reach total about 15 million people conservatively a week one way or another.
[00:03:04.191 --> 00:03:08.913]  And we've reached, I don't know, it's over 300 million on just one of our YouTube channels alone.
[00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:12.454]  We could show some of the viewers, just the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:19.336]  Some of my films have been seen over 40 million times free online, like the Obama deception, tens of millions of times with the other films.
[00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:21.996]  So I want to say, hey, I've got this platform.
[00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:26.918]  You can enter and you know you're standing up against corruption, so you win that way.
[00:03:27.698 --> 00:03:41.623]  You got a chance to win $100,000 and then you've also got a chance whether you win or not to then talk to us about your other ideas and then our ideas and creating I think really three film teams in the next year working with our crew to deploy that.
[00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:42.384]  So I'm kind of like...
[00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.020]  Fire all your guns at once and explode into space.
[00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.602]  I think that's a rock and roll song.
[00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:53.644]  But the point is that we're born to be free, not just born to be wild.
[00:03:53.784 --> 00:03:54.725]  And that of course means free.
[00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:57.346]  And so this is Operation Paul Revere.
[00:03:57.646 --> 00:03:59.367]  You are the Paul Revere of the 21st century.
[00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:01.028]  That's kind of a rant.
[00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:05.710]  But there's two months left and we're getting a lot of great contacts, a lot of great early entries.
[00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:12.456]  I just want the amazing filmmakers out there to know that we're going to take two months to judge this.
[00:04:12.977 --> 00:04:16.140]  And two months to play clips on air and get viewer feedback as well.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.223]  But I'm the final judge.
[00:04:19.283 --> 00:04:20.844]  My crew's going to give me their take as well.
[00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:22.226]  And these are real contests.
[00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:23.126]  So it's coming up.
[00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:24.587]  Deadline is April 30th.
[00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:26.928]  People have got about two and a half months now.
[00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:31.931]  I'm just super excited about this, and I'm super excited about the winners, but playing clips on the show.
[00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:34.593]  Oh, your point about the film festival.
[00:04:34.613 --> 00:04:35.333]  Explain that to people.
[00:04:35.353 --> 00:04:36.113]  That's the most important.
[00:04:36.174 --> 00:04:37.174]  Well, you know, that's one of the things.
[00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:39.495]  People are looking for audiences, right?
[00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:43.097]  And the Cannes Film Festival, they've got a couple hundred thousand people go to that.
[00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:44.398]  But that's one of the biggest ones.
[00:04:44.438 --> 00:04:48.280]  Most of these film festivals, you're only going to have about 10,000, 15,000 people there.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.581]  Not all of them are going to see your film.
[00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:54.584]  With this, you've got 417,000 people just on your one YouTube channel.
[00:04:54.604 --> 00:04:55.725]  And that's just the subscribers.
[00:04:55.765 --> 00:04:56.005]  Right.
[00:04:56.085 --> 00:04:59.427]  So, I mean, one of the things that's really key for filmmakers is they want an audience.
[00:04:59.547 --> 00:05:00.768]  They want people to see their work.
[00:05:00.808 --> 00:05:03.109]  And this is a great chance for people to see what they can do.
[00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.031]  It's kind of like an online virtual film festival.
[00:05:07.185 --> 00:05:19.212]  And I hadn't thought of that, but I mean, that's exactly what it is, a giant online virtual film festival where the public, a radio show, a giant YouTube channel, they see your work, we debate it, we talk about it, you got a chance to win $115,000.
[00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:21.613]  Filmmakers, they want to make films.
[00:05:21.794 --> 00:05:23.434]  If they want to make films, you want to make films.
[00:05:23.454 --> 00:05:24.895]  You want to make a lot of films every year.
[00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:34.161]  So this is a chance, like I said, to get their work out in front of people, make some money, have a good chance of making some big prize money, and have a chance to do a lot of film work.
[00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.182]  I mean, that's, you know, what could be better than that?
[00:05:36.943 --> 00:05:46.765]  I mean, somebody could see this a week before the contest ends, and they could go out and shoot something really dynamic and from the heart that moves us, and, wow, I want to work with that person.
[00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:49.806]  You know, who is the next great Liberty documentary filmmaker?
[00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:51.706]  Right, because it's not just about technical values.
[00:05:51.746 --> 00:05:54.327]  I mean, that's something we're looking for, but it's also about ideas.
[00:05:54.647 --> 00:05:56.307]  You know, it's about the ability to tell a story.
[00:05:56.647 --> 00:06:01.709]  You know, if you've got a good story, as one person pointed out, a good story is kind of like the tip of the arrow.
[00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.449]  You know, the data is the shaft.
[00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.310]  You know, but the arrow is the thing that pierces somebody.
[00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.091]  It really makes them stop and think about it.
[00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:12.553]  It gets them to identify with it on a visceral level, and that's what film can do.
[00:06:12.593 --> 00:06:15.854]  I've talked to so many people who've woken up because they've seen documentaries.
[00:06:15.894 --> 00:06:17.535]  Well, this has opened up to all kinds of things.
[00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:20.776]  It can be a documentary, it can be a fictional account, it can be anything.
[00:06:20.796 --> 00:06:21.176]  There you go!
[00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:24.098]  That's why I'm doing this, and I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:31.361]  Syndicated Radio, 17 years, used to reach, you know, 500,000 people a day, and like 2,000, and a million, and 3 million a day.
[00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:36.264]  But it's still kind of this passive thing where they listen.
[00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:39.027]  But most people say they didn't wake up because of the radio.
[00:06:39.067 --> 00:06:40.748]  They came to the radio because of film.
[00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:47.074]  It's my films that 9 out of 10 people say similarly connected with them and woke them up.
[00:06:47.454 --> 00:06:48.635]  It's the video reports.
[00:06:48.695 --> 00:06:49.556]  It's the mini films.
[00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:50.817]  And that's what I want to do.
[00:06:50.937 --> 00:06:54.260]  Out of the winners, I want to produce maybe two for us,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.560]  Yeah.
[00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:21.783]  I mean, I'm somebody who isn't going to buy a private jet like Rush Limbaugh, which is fine with his money, and fly around in a private jet, and I'm not somebody that's just going to buy 15 Rolexes.
[00:07:22.203 --> 00:07:26.905]  Okay, I don't make anything near Rush Limbaugh, it makes like 50 million a year or something, or going back 80 million a year.
[00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:34.969]  I mean, I make a fraction of that, but I'm trying to take most of that money and trying to make more money so I can, I mean, you're here, you see the building and what's going on.
[00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:37.390]  I mean, this is the best initiative I can think of.
[00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.631]  And it's incredibly worthy of your time and energy.
[00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:44.833]  So, even if you're not a filmmaker and you're watching this, go to the filmmaker message boards.
[00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:46.594]  You've got the real people power.
[00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:48.895]  Go to the IMDB chats.
[00:07:48.955 --> 00:07:54.737]  Go to that and tell people, hey, there's this liberty contest and it's about whatever your idea of liberty is.
[00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:55.998]  That could be the films.
[00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:57.158]  What is your idea of freedom?
[00:07:57.538 --> 00:07:58.699]  What is your idea of tyranny?
[00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:02.840]  So we're not just looking for somebody who's a great cinematographer, videographer.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.780]  I mean that's great too.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.301]  I've seen people say, I sure wish I'd gone to film school and could enter this.
[00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:08.641]  I never went to film school.
[00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:12.922]  I'm one of the most viewed filmmakers uncelebrated in the world.
[00:08:13.122 --> 00:08:14.163]  That's not a power trip.
[00:08:14.523 --> 00:08:18.484]  I mean I just make these, you know, bare knuckles things stating my view and showing it.
[00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:21.064]  And I'm one of the most viewed in the world.
[00:08:21.504 --> 00:08:24.185]  But I don't have the establishment singing my praises and I don't give a damn.
[00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:25.065]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:25.425]  Right, right.
[00:08:25.726 --> 00:08:26.366]  Well, exactly.
[00:08:26.386 --> 00:08:31.608]  The thing is, it doesn't have to be a work of art, but it's got to be compelling content.
[00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:33.810]  And that's what you produce, is compelling content.
[00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.331]  And that's what somebody can do just with the power of being able to tell a story.
[00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:38.412]  And it can be something very short.
[00:08:38.432 --> 00:08:41.153]  You've got this anywhere from three minutes to two hours.
[00:08:41.613 --> 00:08:44.875]  So it can be something like a trailer, it can be a quick example story.
[00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:46.196]  It's the essence, it's the spirit.
[00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:46.796]  Exactly.
[00:08:47.316 --> 00:08:49.258]  Film has a lot of power to change minds.
[00:08:49.318 --> 00:08:55.543]  I mean, you've talked many times about how, in Jaws, they got people afraid of sharks, you know, irrationally afraid of sharks.
[00:08:56.183 --> 00:09:00.006]  In Dr. Strangelove, okay, they ridiculed fluoridation of water.
[00:09:00.026 --> 00:09:01.207]  It really made it look kooky.
[00:09:01.547 --> 00:09:02.448]  So you can do a lot of things.
[00:09:02.468 --> 00:09:08.833]  You can take Brazil, where they took authoritarian governments, ridiculed them, but really made a strong point about authoritarianism.
[00:09:09.253 --> 00:09:20.265]  So, a story has a really powerful way to affect people, to really change hearts and minds, and right now we've got a lot of people who are just willing to give up their liberty for the promise of security.
[00:09:20.345 --> 00:09:23.047]  So I think this is, you know, in terms of what's your target audience?
[00:09:23.087 --> 00:09:28.673]  What are you trying to, you know, when you want to wake people up, what are the people, you're looking for people who are asleep, right?
[00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.215]  That you want these films to reach out to?
[00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:36.098]  Again, David Knight, that's why I'm so glad you're here and we're part of the last contest, because you're really a smart guy.
[00:09:36.558 --> 00:09:39.219]  He just crystallized everything I tried to say in five minutes.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.480]  This is a big deal.
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:52.286]  We've got the bad guys, the big corporations, the globalists, out there financing all this tyranny, all this garbage, all this pro-war, anti-liberty, anti-family garbage.
[00:09:52.546 --> 00:09:55.348]  Pro drone, pro surveillance state, pro GMO.
[00:09:55.868 --> 00:10:01.272]  But then you do see there are good people out there like Terry Gilliam and others who are putting films out like Brazil.
[00:10:01.692 --> 00:10:03.573]  We need to see more of that.
[00:10:03.653 --> 00:10:11.218]  We need to see the creative force out there turned loose and realizing that there are other people out there as well that are doing this.
[00:10:11.258 --> 00:10:12.960]  So our target audience
[00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:20.707]  Is basically everybody, but particularly those that are somewhat awake, but that don't really get the big picture.
[00:10:21.848 --> 00:10:33.174]  And so really, my target audience is trying to get people to creatively realize they have power, and that there is an information war going on, and that people need to get involved.
[00:10:34.295 --> 00:10:35.076]  I'm a Paul Revere.
[00:10:35.096 --> 00:10:35.997]  You're a Paul Revere.
[00:10:36.037 --> 00:10:45.046]  We're trying to get other Paul Reveres to take action to trigger other Paul Reveres to have a societal shift to the fact that the authoritarians are really taking over and we're in great danger.
[00:10:45.606 --> 00:10:49.670]  So, you know, when we say target audience, it's to awaken the sleeping giant.
[00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.932]  It is to engage in a Paul Revere event.
[00:10:52.353 --> 00:10:54.295]  And it could be any topic, you know, out there.
[00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:55.976]  It could be smart meters, Second Amendment.
[00:10:56.016 --> 00:10:56.337]  It could be
[00:10:56.977 --> 00:10:57.878]  Twenty subjects.
[00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.739]  It could be what's happened to a personal family.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.321]  I mean, there's just so many ideas.
[00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:08.704]  This is a giant brainstorming session we're having with $115,000 in the middle of it.
[00:11:09.284 --> 00:11:11.926]  But that's only there to signify this is important.
[00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:20.231]  Close out here, because I want you to be able to make your points and your impassioned plea to folks with the logic, not just my points, because there's quite a few of them there.
[00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:22.232]  Go ahead and recap things, and thanks for having me on the show.
[00:11:22.492 --> 00:11:25.396]  Well, I think, you know, we talked about the power of Hollywood to change things.
[00:11:25.456 --> 00:11:36.189]  The fact that you've got movies like The Dark Knight can be used to condition people to be irrationally afraid of something like going to a football game without being patted and scanned down by the TSA.
[00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:40.735]  You know, you present that image and that sticks in people's hearts, sticks in their minds.
[00:11:41.315 --> 00:11:43.718]  We can do that sort of thing with positive images.
[00:11:43.778 --> 00:11:54.490]  Think of something like Schindler's List or think of The Hiding Place, Corey Ten Boom, someone who helped hide people from the Nazis and eventually was captured herself and sent to a concentration camp but lived to tell about it.
[00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:02.158]  So there's a tremendous amount of opportunity here to change hearts and minds and that's what we want to cut loose is the
[00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:03.560]  We're good to go.
[00:12:22.134 --> 00:12:23.995]  Go to Operation Paul Revere.
[00:12:24.475 --> 00:12:28.676]  Take a look at Infowars.com slash contest and you'll find all the information there.
[00:12:28.736 --> 00:12:29.437]  It's pretty open.
[00:12:29.517 --> 00:12:33.038]  There's not a lot of requirements there, but there are a few.
[00:12:33.218 --> 00:12:34.578]  So take a look at what we've got there.
[00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:35.959]  Put your hat in the ring.
[00:12:36.099 --> 00:12:39.060]  Be part of the solution to the corruption and oppression.
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.601]  Be part of the resistance to tyranny.
[00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:47.243]  We're looking for the Paul Reveres that will drive a stake through the New World Order's wicked heart.
