[00:00:10.492 --> 00:00:16.876]  Here at the University of Texas, I've decided to ask some students what they think of President Obama's assault weapons ban.
[00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.599]  If the feds start confiscating assault weapons, will you turn your guns in?
[00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.720]  Absolutely not.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.380]  No chance.
[00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:30.886]  I completely disagree with what President Obama said the other day and his order and all that, and I will not turn any of my guns in.
[00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.768]  There's nothing they can really do that will change my mind about that.
[00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.672]  Well, personally, I don't have any guns on me, but if I did, I probably wouldn't.
[00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:44.153]  Just a matter of protection for myself, or if I had a family, for my family.
[00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:47.734]  I don't own any guns, so I don't have any to turn in.
[00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:51.076]  Do you think other people should turn them in?
[00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:52.056]  I do.
[00:00:52.136 --> 00:01:00.120]  I think that you should follow the law, and also I'm kind of against assault weapon guns and guns in general, and I don't see that there's that much of a need for them.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.102]  If everyone turns them in, then you won't need them to defend against other people with.
[00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:12.506]  I don't own any assault weapons, but I am a gun owner, and my guns would be in compliance with those new laws, and so it wouldn't personally affect me.
[00:01:13.527 --> 00:01:30.872]  But if I did own assault weapons, I would comply with the law, because I don't think that other than the headstrong Southern attitude that I have, what's mine is mine, there's no reason to be owning assault weapons in a just personal setting.
[00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:39.581]  How do you feel about President Obama bringing children on stage as he talks about gun control, yet he's killed at least 168 kids in drone attacks in Pakistan?
[00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:49.344]  I think national security and domestic security are two different issues, and that security abroad is a separate issue entirely from security inside the nation.
[00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:52.505]  I feel that's kind of, almost super critical, in a way.
[00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:54.432]  Yeah, I don't agree with that.
[00:01:54.492 --> 00:02:01.338]  I think that dragging kids into it and having them listen to all this stuff, they do need to be educated, but I think they're way too young, and I think that's wrong.
[00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:02.439]  I don't agree with that at all.
[00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:05.642]  I mean, I don't think it's fair to bring kids onto the stage as he talks about it.
[00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:11.987]  It's kind of unfair to make his point that way, but I think a life's a life and it shouldn't be lost either way.
[00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.010]  So, I think it needs to be on both sides.
[00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.694]  It needs to value the life of children as much as, you know, Pakistani civilians.
[00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:28.324]  Maybe he feels bad about all the kids that he has unintentionally killed and he's trying to make up for that by saying that, you know, by bringing the kids on stage.
[00:02:29.196 --> 00:02:41.641]  No one is... He's not... In the way of asking the question, that way you're making the blame go specifically on a single person, on the President of the United States, when it's a much more complicated and complex issue.
[00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:46.103]  And then in those sort of situations, you can't place the blame on one person.
[00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:49.124]  Yes, people have died, but people die in any sort of conflict.
[00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:55.307]  I don't personally agree with our presence in the Middle East, but I'm going to support our President and the sort of decisions he makes.
[00:02:55.627 --> 00:02:57.788]  And I think that having drones in the Middle East
[00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:00.428]  No, I don't think it's un-American.
[00:03:00.448 --> 00:03:05.070]  Just because I think that within America, each state does have its right to make their own laws.
[00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.670]  I don't think that it's un-American.
[00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.970]  I find that
[00:03:30.197 --> 00:03:39.722]  States, when they have enough reason to stray away from the national government, it is their right to do that.
[00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:49.346]  I guess it would be considered un-American to push the feds back because these are the same people that we expect to protect us, the same people who we expect to watch our homeland security.
[00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:53.768]  Okay, and lastly, can you recite the Second Amendment?
[00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:55.549]  The Second Amendment.
[00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.520]  No, I cannot at this point.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.361]  I forgot, clearly.
[00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:00.942]  I don't know the first one.
[00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:02.043]  Freedom of speech.
[00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:05.726]  Second one should be right to the press, isn't it?
[00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:09.868]  Right to press, or... Yeah, it's probably that.
[00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.510]  I should feel ashamed of myself, though, wanting to be a lawyer.
[00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:15.092]  The right to bear arms.
[00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:17.214]  Every citizen should have the right to bear arms.
[00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:21.096]  And it mentions in there something about a militia.
[00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:24.639]  I don't... I used to know it.
[00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:25.840]  I'm sorry.
[00:04:26.812 --> 00:04:27.513]  Uh, the right to bear arms.
[00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:32.900]  Okay, and it mentions something about a militia in the Second Amendment.
[00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:35.543]  Oh, okay, uh, my bad.
[00:04:36.464 --> 00:04:38.126]  Uh, no, I have no idea what it is.
[00:04:38.146 --> 00:04:39.328]  Could you say it to me?
[00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:42.232]  I cannot.
[00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:45.436]  Reporting for InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Ortiz.
