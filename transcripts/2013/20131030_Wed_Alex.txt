[00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:09.587]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.587 --> 00:00:11.189]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:12.730]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.915]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:21.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:44.214]  All right, folks, it is another unbelievably jam-packed broadcast day lined up for us here at 11 a.m.
[00:00:44.214 --> 00:00:45.255]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:53.738]  I know a lot of stations carry us live, others air us at different times around the country, and there's folks listening on shortwave and satellite and Internet all over the world.
[00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:56.679]  I want to welcome you to the World Wide Transmission.
[00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:03.402]  And I really realize that I've tried this about a hundred times and failed every time, but I think today is going to be the day that I succeed.
[00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:06.807]  Everybody pretty much knows what a lot of the big news is.
[00:01:06.807 --> 00:01:16.458]  There is some breaking news we're going to be getting to, but I'm going to just open the phones up for first-time callers, and I'm going to go to your phone call, and I'm going to give the person one minute, and then I'm going to move to the next person.
[00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:18.321]  Now, I've never actually been able to do this.
[00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:23.987]  Back 10, 15 years ago, I could do talk radio and take 50 phone calls in an hour, in 45 minutes of airtime.
[00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:36.858]  I just cannot get out of the rut I'm in of just covering news and ranting and pontificating, which is incredibly popular and I think informative to a certain extent, but I am still very hungry.
[00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:41.156]  And many of you have heard this probably a hundred times in the last ten years.
[00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:46.579]  Heard me give this speech, and I'm going to take your calls, and it's kind of like licking to the center of a Tootsie Roll.
[00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.301]  How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop, or whatever it's called?
[00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:55.584]  And a little owl goes, one, a two, a three, crunch, a three!
[00:01:55.584 --> 00:01:56.484]  And it's the same thing.
[00:01:56.484 --> 00:02:04.889]  I can never get through five or six articles without one of them making me mad, and then going off onto a rant that makes me think of something else that goes into another rant.
[00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:06.950]  But, in the interest of time,
[00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.357]  We are going to come back, open the phones up and take a lot of calls and go over news as well.
[00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:22.223]  Facebook photo shows another Google mystery barge off the coast of Maine.
[00:02:22.223 --> 00:02:27.688]  This is a technological above breakaway civilization takeover.
[00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:29.871]  That's what I keep explaining to people.
[00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:32.814]  These are NSA ships lying off the coast.
[00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:37.806]  In fact, we ought to play that Christa Burge song that the network's got.
[00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:43.729]  I think it's called Revolution, because it talks about tall ships lying off the coast.
[00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.910]  And they carry the light and the dark of the night.
[00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.510]  Not this time.
[00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.392]  They carry the spy grid.
[00:02:50.392 --> 00:02:53.753]  And they're just doing whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:58.361]  And they're even preparing for plan B's.
[00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:06.234]  If we pass laws making what they've done illegal, they're going to do it offshore because the globalists are offshore diplomatic immunity above the law.
[00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:17.309]  And they're trying to disarm all of our nations and all of us individually so only the corporate global government has private mercenary armies and the UN and NATO have their army.
[00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:26.952]  And then what's left of our nation armies are components of that new global army where the militaries can't even operate and can't even function on their own.
[00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:30.893]  And they can't even get the components for the weapon systems unless it comes from China.
[00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:33.374]  This is what they admit globalism is about.
[00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:35.695]  It is a diabolical scientific plan.
[00:03:36.778 --> 00:03:38.720]  And they are carrying it out.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.323]  And then now they're launching giant spy ships.
[00:03:42.323 --> 00:03:49.009]  And notice, you know, they're going to know what's in your baby's diaper if he goes to the airport, but nobody's going to know what Google's doing.
[00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.612]  And then Google has, like, oh, we drink beer and play pinball at the headquarters.
[00:03:52.612 --> 00:03:53.933]  We have movies with comedians.
[00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.354]  We're non-threatening.
[00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:59.338]  We wear different color socks and have handlebar mustaches and tattoos.
[00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:00.139]  We're trendy.
[00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.701]  They are scientific war chiefs of evil.
[00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:09.767]  Eugenicists sworn to create a digital grid to track everything to cut the resources off.
[00:04:10.694 --> 00:04:24.723]  They are a giant silicon boa constrictor that has wrapped itself around humanity, spying on everything we do to know our hopes and dreams, to ensure we're deceived and our hopes and dreams are dashed.
[00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:27.285]  Google is Satan.
[00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:29.126]  And of course, what would Satan tell you?
[00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:31.667]  He would say, I am an angel of light.
[00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:33.629]  I am not evil.
[00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:34.509]  Don't be evil.
[00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:35.630]  And then of course laugh.
[00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:37.246]  Oh!
[00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:38.647]  Brings it here into the barrel.
[00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:40.269]  Oh, I see nothing!
[00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:41.630]  I was not here!
[00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.134]  I did not even get up this morning!
[00:04:46.134 --> 00:04:46.855]  Everything's fine.
[00:04:46.855 --> 00:04:48.036]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:51.078]  Being informed is scary, so just laugh at me.
[00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:52.099]  Racist.
[00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.522]  Boston bombing mastermind.
[00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:56.644]  Conspiracy tard.
[00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:57.905]  I'll be right back.
[00:04:57.905 --> 00:04:59.126]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:16.140]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.822]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:20.163]  They're the good guys.

[00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:05.636]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:13.023]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:06:13.023 --> 00:06:16.386]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:06:16.386 --> 00:06:18.148]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:06:18.408 --> 00:06:23.049]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.970]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.931]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:35.591]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:40.852]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:06:40.852 --> 00:06:43.813]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:50.062]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:06:50.062 --> 00:06:52.225]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:06.099]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:15.006]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:22.832]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:30.218]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:16.558]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:16.558 --> 00:08:25.404]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:26.965]  The past is gone.
[00:08:39.276 --> 00:08:48.620]  It went by like dusk till dawn.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.321]  Isn't that the way?
[00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:57.223]  Everybody's got the dues in life to pay.
[00:08:57.223 --> 00:09:06.567]  I know.
[00:09:06.567 --> 00:09:07.247]  Here's the key.
[00:09:14.613 --> 00:09:16.915]  There's the key that Andy State knows that.
[00:09:16.915 --> 00:09:20.417]  You've got to lose, but know how to win.
[00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:24.080]  The adversities in my life are the most cherished parts of my life.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:32.706]  Looking back, half my life has been in books, written pages.
[00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:37.069]  Oh yeah, listening to fools and from sages.
[00:09:38.188 --> 00:09:42.070]  You learn from fools and from sages.
[00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.412]  You know it's true.
[00:09:45.412 --> 00:09:53.856]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Wednesday worldwide broadcast, the 30th day, the 30th day of October 2013.
[00:09:53.856 --> 00:09:57.238]  We will soon enter 2014.
[00:09:57.238 --> 00:10:02.501]  We are at an incredibly important crossroads, obviously, historically.
[00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:03.822]  Folks are having a choice now.
[00:10:03.822 --> 00:10:05.763]  Go with the lie of the globalist?
[00:10:06.636 --> 00:10:25.663]  Go with all their frauds and all their curses and all of their poverty and all of their humiliation and all of their scams, but admit to ourselves that we're slaves, or stand up and do something about it.
[00:10:25.663 --> 00:10:32.126]  But then still others won't admit they're slaves, they're just going to rationalize and go along
[00:10:35.814 --> 00:10:44.436]  With whatever's put in front of them because they can't even imagine that they could be leaders or that they could resist or that they could build a better world.
[00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:48.037]  They are receivers, not transmitters.
[00:10:48.037 --> 00:10:54.418]  They are spectators, not players on the gladiatorial field of life.
[00:10:54.418 --> 00:11:00.399]  And the nanny state does everything it can to keep you from participating in reality.
[00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:04.360]  It wants you in the Madison Avenue, high-tech,
[00:11:07.492 --> 00:11:31.263]  false reality artificial habitat times square on steroids directly wired into your brain that's where they want to take us and not take us there to empower us take us there so that mankind will fade from the earth and a new super homo sapiens sapien
[00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:35.520]  Technology system will rise.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.300]  You could give it whatever name you wanted.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.320]  What do you call homo sapien sapien?
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:46.362]  Merge with machine, given God-like omnipresent awareness.
[00:11:46.362 --> 00:11:53.023]  You call it delusions of grandeur.
[00:11:53.023 --> 00:11:59.465]  Humanity is perfect in our imperfection, through God perfecting us.
[00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:00.945]  We are an expression
[00:12:02.654 --> 00:12:05.556]  We are in the image of the Creator.
[00:12:05.556 --> 00:12:09.200]  We are a dream of God.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.041]  We are in the mind of God.
[00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:16.246]  As Mohammed Gandhi said, in each of us is the seed of the universe.
[00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:23.191]  You think the twisted systems of the global technocrats and their wizards have developed are going to empower us?
[00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:26.154]  They are going to enslave us.
[00:12:26.154 --> 00:12:30.678]  The fruits of the New World Order are stinking death.
[00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:34.449]  Now I'm not going to preach here today.
[00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:35.689]  I'm going to do something different.
[00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:36.870]  I'm going to do it.
[00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:44.013]  I'm not going to cover news until about 45 after, and then I'll hit all the big top stories that are here.
[00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:47.935]  Out of all the insanity, Obamacare even worse than I thought.
[00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:58.821]  Designed for pure fraud, and incredible preparations for martial law, and school children being taught that they must follow the orders of government no matter what, and their parents are bad.
[00:13:00.248 --> 00:13:08.760]  Russell Brand, listener of the show, said that he took a job working at a newspaper because he was enamored with the beautiful woman that headed it up.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.322]  He was enchanted by her.
[00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:17.331]  Instead of saying, oh, how romantic, the chivalry, the, oh, no, he's been skewered by the feminazis.
[00:13:18.112 --> 00:13:19.532]  As Russ Limbaugh would call them.
[00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:23.453]  He's been skewered by them who know that they're taking over the culture.
[00:13:23.453 --> 00:13:24.873]  It's not about empowering women.
[00:13:24.873 --> 00:13:26.994]  It's about empowering them as tyrants.
[00:13:26.994 --> 00:13:40.296]  Never before, but with modern feminism as it's called, have we seen women more debased, more bankrupted, more unhealthy, more brought low, more dishonored, more trampled.
[00:13:40.296 --> 00:13:44.577]  And Russell Brand tells the establishment anti-human authoritarian salon,
[00:13:47.210 --> 00:14:00.455]  That he took a job working somewhere because he was so enchanted with the female editor that headed it up, and then they called that hateful and all the rest of it.
[00:14:00.455 --> 00:14:05.677]  When I was asked to edit an issue of the New Statesman, I said yes because it was a beautiful woman asking me.
[00:14:05.677 --> 00:14:12.200]  See, just the act of men and women loving each other, just the purity and goodness of that.
[00:14:13.655 --> 00:14:15.436]  is anathema to these people.
[00:14:15.436 --> 00:14:18.456]  They know what they're doing.
[00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:21.117]  They say, you can't dress up like a cowboy on Halloween.
[00:14:21.117 --> 00:14:22.818]  It's hurtful to cowboys.
[00:14:22.818 --> 00:14:24.838]  They are the arbiters of reality.
[00:14:24.838 --> 00:14:29.440]  They put you in a smaller and smaller cage where your mommy and daddy can't make your lunch.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.200]  They're not trusted.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.462]  Where if someone says, hey, let's go eat Chinese food, everyone goes, don't say Chinese.
[00:14:35.462 --> 00:14:36.182]  I've witnessed that.
[00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:41.680]  This is the ultimate tyranny, and it's done by design.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.881]  These are not misguided liberals.
[00:14:43.881 --> 00:14:47.163]  These are conscious dominators of the psyche.
[00:14:47.163 --> 00:14:52.387]  The most vicious, miscreant enemies of humanity that you could even imagine.
[00:14:52.387 --> 00:14:55.969]  And I'm only now coming to the realization of it.
[00:14:55.969 --> 00:15:00.252]  I've run into them over the years, I've talked to them and see the hateful glare, but more and more they admit it.
[00:15:00.252 --> 00:15:01.693]  They are proud of it.
[00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:06.636]  And that's why they see true liberals, Thomas Jeffersonian,
[00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:22.356]  Libertarian, constitutional, lovin' risk, lovin' fast cars, lovin' honor, lovin' strong men, lovin' pure women, lovin' real fights, trailblazing adventurism.
[00:15:22.356 --> 00:15:23.497]  Humanity!
[00:15:23.497 --> 00:15:27.279]  They are at war with humanity because they're ugly inside.
[00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:28.620]  They're twisted.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.482]  They hate anyone being smart.
[00:15:30.482 --> 00:15:32.063]  They hate anyone being original.
[00:15:32.463 --> 00:15:38.787]  Everything they do is about dominating you while they are hyper-armed and hyper-vicious.
[00:15:38.787 --> 00:15:45.751]  No feminist would dare criticize Bill Clinton except somebody like Camille Paglia, who's a real feminist if you want to say that.
[00:15:45.751 --> 00:15:52.095]  You know, actual deep thoughts about empowering women, not just fake garbage to suck women into doing what you say to enslave them.
[00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:58.932]  I think she was the only one that would criticize Bill Clinton when he shuttled cases for raping women and biting them and beating them.
[00:15:58.932 --> 00:16:02.135]  It was like, oh, how sexy when Bill Clinton rapes a woman.
[00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:03.357]  It's sick!
[00:16:03.357 --> 00:16:07.841]  These are sick, sick, sick, sick, sick enemies.
[00:16:08.642 --> 00:16:10.223]  I said I'm taking your calls.
[00:16:10.223 --> 00:16:11.963]  I'm taking one call after the other.
[00:16:11.963 --> 00:16:15.025]  First-time callers on whatever issue you want to talk about.
[00:16:15.025 --> 00:16:16.285]  Questions, comments, you name it.
[00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:17.906]  But you're gonna have about 45 seconds.
[00:16:17.906 --> 00:16:19.226]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:19.547]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:19.547 --> 00:16:19.587]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:26.732 --> 00:16:27.273]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:27.273 --> 00:16:39.390]  It is time in our lives to stop putting up with bureaucrats pushing us around, corporations pushing us around, people in our lives pushing us around, people taking advantage of us.
[00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.055]  I myself have committed to be good to people that are good to me more than ever.
[00:16:43.596 --> 00:16:53.544]  To share with those that are pure of heart and good more than ever, but those that are backstabbing, manipulating liars, I will purge 110% from my life completely!
[00:16:53.544 --> 00:17:00.469]  Because we're going to see the fall of society, ladies and gentlemen, but out of it will rise again a greater civilization.
[00:17:00.469 --> 00:17:09.796]  Through testing true humanity and giving humanity time to decide what we want to do with the machines and the neural interfaces and what we want to become.
[00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:12.058]  We're going to have a real debate about humanity's future.
[00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.672]  They have it already set where humanity's not going to the stars.
[00:17:16.672 --> 00:17:17.873]  Humanity's going nowhere.
[00:17:17.873 --> 00:17:21.435]  Humanity is to be extincted in every globalist publication.
[00:17:21.435 --> 00:17:27.979]  And a handful of these control freaks believe they're going to merge with machines and become God.
[00:17:27.979 --> 00:17:29.600]  They have such a lack of vision.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.323]  If they had any vision at all, they would know that is not going to be allowed.
[00:17:34.323 --> 00:17:36.604]  Ever.
[00:17:36.604 --> 00:17:39.806]  The very spirit of the universe is justice.
[00:17:39.806 --> 00:17:40.987]  They will be
[00:17:42.205 --> 00:17:46.787]  Humiliated and destroyed and their lines will be destroyed.
[00:17:46.787 --> 00:17:51.490]  And those in the establishment who still have any soul left and know and hear my words.
[00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:55.203]  And it's fulfilling you, and you're attracted to it.
[00:17:55.203 --> 00:17:58.606]  It's because it's the truth, and you must become good.
[00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.267]  You must turn away from the evil.
[00:18:00.267 --> 00:18:16.259]  You must join humanity and all of the tens of billions of honorable men, women, and children that struggled to carry the ball forward for humanity against every adversity on the long march towards our ultimate destiny!
[00:18:16.259 --> 00:18:19.742]  Not this fraud counterfeit of the New World Order!
[00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:26.157]  The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard what God has in store for us.
[00:18:26.157 --> 00:18:31.601]  And you're not going to hear it from the Rick Warren saying, turn your guns in, evangelical stuff.
[00:18:31.601 --> 00:18:35.223]  You know why the Pentagon came out and said we're going to arrest evangelicals in the military?
[00:18:35.223 --> 00:18:36.484]  And you're not allowed to be part of the Tea Party.
[00:18:36.484 --> 00:18:38.746]  If you give money, the evangelicals will arrest you.
[00:18:38.746 --> 00:18:43.629]  That's because they know they've got the evangelical church now, calling for open borders, turning our guns in.
[00:18:43.629 --> 00:18:50.474]  They've taken that over, the big dominant ones, and they've got them carrying the ball, so they know they won't complain as part of the agreement.
[00:18:54.295 --> 00:18:59.177]  See, it's all been predetermined who the sellouts are, who the Judas goats are.
[00:18:59.177 --> 00:19:01.678]  It's all been prepared.
[00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:13.043]  That's bold when they come out and say, we will arrest you if you give money or go to a Protestant, excuse me, Evangelical church.
[00:19:13.043 --> 00:19:17.065]  And that was only buried in the Fox News article, and the Pentagon admitted it was going on.
[00:19:18.197 --> 00:19:20.801]  Imagine in America, you will be arrested.
[00:19:20.801 --> 00:19:21.983]  And where's Rick Warren?
[00:19:21.983 --> 00:19:23.225]  Where's all the evangelicals?
[00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:23.826]  Where are they?
[00:19:23.826 --> 00:19:25.629]  They're not even evangelicals anymore.
[00:19:25.629 --> 00:19:26.791]  They get government funding.
[00:19:31.593 --> 00:19:34.875]  Alright folks, we're going to go to break.
[00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:37.796]  And when we come back, we're going to go to your phone calls.
[00:19:37.796 --> 00:19:38.156]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:38.156 --> 00:19:39.197]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:39.197 --> 00:19:48.561]  And I'm giving each caller one minute, and then we're moving on to the next person.
[00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:51.643]  Pat, Rick, Dee, many others, your calls are coming up.
[00:19:51.643 --> 00:19:57.806]  I'm going to take four phone calls in the next six minute short segment, and then I'm going to take 18 phone calls in the next segment.
[00:19:57.806 --> 00:19:59.427]  I will do it straight ahead.
[00:20:00.447 --> 00:20:04.928]  Every day it becomes more clear our nation is headed towards an uncertain future.
[00:20:04.928 --> 00:20:08.588]  Nothing can ensure your family's security like an Atlas Survival Shelter.
[00:20:08.588 --> 00:20:12.589]  The strongest money can buy and designed to be buried up to 42 feet deep.
[00:20:12.589 --> 00:20:15.570]  With all the comforts of home and all the protection you need.
[00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:21.291]  Bulletproof hatches, tamper-resistant air pipes, and a unique ground design that'll withstand a bomb.
[00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:26.091]  See them today at iwantthatbunker.com or call 1-855-4-BUNKER.
[00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:27.712]  Atlas Survival Shelters.
[00:20:27.712 --> 00:20:29.512]  Better prepared than scared.
[00:20:30.072 --> 00:20:32.453]  So, you've decided to get prepared.
[00:20:32.453 --> 00:20:38.654]  You're not sure that a case of ramen and a couple of granola bars under your bed will cut it as long-term food storage anymore.
[00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:39.475]  You're in luck!
[00:20:39.475 --> 00:20:43.056]  At Emergency Essentials, we have all the resources to get you started.
[00:20:43.056 --> 00:20:48.417]  From three-day emergency bug-out bags to a year's supplies of food and everything in between.
[00:20:48.417 --> 00:20:50.658]  Call Emergency Essentials at 800-999-1863 or visit BePrepared.com.
[00:20:55.439 --> 00:20:56.740]  The choice is clear.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.842]  Be unprepared or beprepared.com.
[00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:02.224]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[00:21:02.224 --> 00:21:15.234]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:18.217]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:21:18.217 --> 00:21:20.420]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.324]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target.
[00:21:24.324 --> 00:21:26.827]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:34.856]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:21:35.416 --> 00:21:41.120]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:48.065]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:21:48.065 --> 00:21:49.546]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com.
[00:21:49.546 --> 00:21:51.207]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:21:59.432 --> 00:22:05.178]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:22:05.178 --> 00:22:12.565]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:22:12.565 --> 00:22:15.768]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:22:15.888 --> 00:22:17.909]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:22.552]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:22:22.552 --> 00:22:25.474]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:22:25.474 --> 00:22:31.437]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:22:31.437 --> 00:22:35.099]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:40.342]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:22:40.342 --> 00:22:43.304]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:43.524 --> 00:22:49.509]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:22:49.509 --> 00:22:51.671]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:57.176]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:57.176 --> 00:22:58.537]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:02.479]  Not all protein powders are created equal.
[00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:11.943]  One World Way is the first cold-temperature processed, 100% all-natural, unrefined, bioactive, grass-pasture-raised, milk-whey protein.
[00:23:11.943 --> 00:23:24.509]  Far from being another ordinary protein supplement, One World Way is a full-spectrum, nutrition-powered food in and of itself, providing overall life-building benefits that touch virtually every human's life that other protein supplements don't deliver on.
[00:23:24.949 --> 00:23:25.970]  What are the benefits?
[00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.151]  Boosts the immune system.
[00:23:27.151 --> 00:23:28.451]  Anti-aging properties.
[00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:29.832]  Helps detoxification.
[00:23:29.832 --> 00:23:30.993]  Helps lose body fat.
[00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:32.975]  Supports excellent blood sugar levels.
[00:23:32.975 --> 00:23:34.235]  Excellent for building muscle.
[00:23:34.235 --> 00:23:35.636]  Increases in energy levels.
[00:23:35.636 --> 00:23:37.157]  Enhances the feelings of youth.
[00:23:37.157 --> 00:23:39.399]  Energy for exercise and recovery.
[00:23:39.399 --> 00:23:40.300]  Who's it for?
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.181]  Anyone wanting to feel healthy and have energy.
[00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:42.961]  We're good.
[00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:11.511]  Coming up after we take calls, FCC to police news media.
[00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:16.473]  Question reporters in a wide-ranging content survey, including non-broadcast media.
[00:24:16.473 --> 00:24:18.774]  They believe they run everything.
[00:24:18.774 --> 00:24:20.955]  And most of the media's controls, that won't be an issue.
[00:24:20.955 --> 00:24:27.557]  In fact, I have other video reports where mainstream globalist media is promoting going after conspiracy terrorists.
[00:24:27.557 --> 00:24:30.979]  That means anyone that questions the known liars in the system.
[00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:37.420]  The Federal Communications Commission is planning a broad probe of political speech across media platforms.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.061]  An unprecedented move that raises serious First Amendment concerns.
[00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:51.663]  Really, they told the army, army-wide, if you're evangelical and give money to an evangelical church, that's a terrorist group, we're going to court-martial you and the Tea Party.
[00:24:51.663 --> 00:24:55.624]  I mean, they should all be arrested right there.
[00:24:55.624 --> 00:24:57.244]  They want to arrest us for our speech?
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.680]  Hi, good morning Alex.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.441]  Just wanted to say I admire your devotion to the cause.
[00:25:03.441 --> 00:25:09.162]  I've learned a lot from you in the past year, actually, watching and listening to the show.
[00:25:09.162 --> 00:25:11.503]  Basically, just was interested in some updates.
[00:25:23.012 --> 00:25:26.093]  In particular, how is Adam Kotesh doing?
[00:25:26.093 --> 00:25:32.416]  How's the investigation with the Manning case, the Rolling Stone guy that was blown up in his car?
[00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:33.637]  Sure, sure.
[00:25:33.637 --> 00:25:34.958]  Those are big issues.
[00:25:34.958 --> 00:25:37.219]  I appreciate your call.
[00:25:37.219 --> 00:25:38.299]  I've tried to get Adam on.
[00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:39.300]  I've talked to him on the phone.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:48.629]  Then he's kind of owl-y about when he'll come on or what he'll do, and he says, go to my updates or whatever, and I think his trial's going on, and it's total political persecution.
[00:25:48.629 --> 00:25:57.299]  As for Hastings, there's no doubt they murdered him, and that's just, you know, the bottom line right there, and there's a cover-up of that.
[00:25:57.299 --> 00:25:58.941]  I mean, we're living in a tyranny.
[00:25:58.941 --> 00:26:00.843]  Dee in Nebraska, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:26:03.166 --> 00:26:10.951]  Hey, last Friday there was just a little blurb that was on about the big earthquake that hit again in Japan around the Fukushima area.
[00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:20.218]  Yeah, the great news is there was some flooding and more radiation got out, but there weren't any big disasters that were caused by it.
[00:26:20.218 --> 00:26:22.279]  So, dodged a bullet on that one.
[00:26:22.279 --> 00:26:23.080]  Well, that's good.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.861]  I hadn't heard anything since Friday.
[00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:25.781]  I was just wondering.
[00:26:25.781 --> 00:26:31.085]  Yeah, I updated it on the nightly news, but I should have updated it on the Sunday show.
[00:26:31.085 --> 00:26:31.986]  You got a good point.
[00:26:31.986 --> 00:26:32.206]  Go ahead.
[00:26:32.885 --> 00:26:33.325]  All right.
[00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:38.908]  I just wanted to let you know that I pray for you and your staff daily and just keep up the good work.
[00:26:38.908 --> 00:26:39.489]  God bless you.
[00:26:39.489 --> 00:26:40.649]  Thank you so much for calling, Dee.
[00:26:40.649 --> 00:26:41.490]  Good to hear your voice.
[00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.051]  Let's talk to Rick in Illinois.
[00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:44.891]  Rick, you're on the air.
[00:26:44.891 --> 00:26:46.332]  Welcome.
[00:26:46.332 --> 00:26:47.373]  Hi, Alex.
[00:26:47.373 --> 00:26:55.397]  I wanted to point out a very important documentary that will be very uplifting for all of us to have a review, and it's called Sir, No Sir.
[00:26:55.397 --> 00:26:59.299]  It's the true story of how the Vietnam War was brought to an end.
[00:26:59.704 --> 00:27:01.395]  You know, I heard about that.
[00:27:01.395 --> 00:27:02.562]  That's a book, too, isn't it?
[00:27:03.797 --> 00:27:04.478]  I can tell you that.
[00:27:04.478 --> 00:27:10.162]  I do know that I found it at my local library and that it is also available online through YouTube.
[00:27:10.162 --> 00:27:22.531]  Well, that's why they want to go to robots and combat mechs and drones for submarines, ships, planes and ground forces because they will follow orders by the offshore Google command pods.
[00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:29.076]  Remember, Google was allowed to drive around worldwide with cars with government hack codes to get in your computer and steal your passcodes.
[00:27:29.076 --> 00:27:32.438]  And they didn't get in trouble because they are the NSA.
[00:27:32.438 --> 00:27:33.239]  But they got
[00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:35.249]  Red and green and yellow.
[00:27:35.249 --> 00:27:36.150]  Google.
[00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.191]  Looks kind of friendly.
[00:27:37.191 --> 00:27:42.135]  I'm telling you, if Hitler would have worn a rainbow outfit, we would have submitted to him.
[00:27:42.135 --> 00:27:43.376]  I appreciate your call.
[00:27:43.376 --> 00:27:44.116]  At least nowadays.
[00:27:44.116 --> 00:27:47.279]  I mean, if you just go, trendy, trendy, and then it's non-threatening.
[00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:50.721]  You could walk up with somebody and go in like a pink outfit and go, here's a dagger.
[00:27:50.721 --> 00:27:52.323]  I'm going to stab you in the throat.
[00:27:52.323 --> 00:27:54.444]  They'd go, oh, go ahead and do it.
[00:27:54.444 --> 00:27:56.966]  As long as it's don't be evil.
[00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:57.607]  Let's go ahead.
[00:27:57.607 --> 00:27:59.508]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[00:27:59.508 --> 00:28:01.410]  Jonathan in South Carolina.
[00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:01.930]  You're on the air.
[00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.271]  Go ahead.
[00:28:03.396 --> 00:28:06.501]  Hey Alex, I first wanted to give you my war cry.
[00:28:06.501 --> 00:28:08.104]  Here it goes.
[00:28:18.692 --> 00:28:24.935]  Well, I want to tell you that I have spoken to my local sheriff in the past few days.
[00:28:24.935 --> 00:28:32.139]  I gave him a couple of InfoWars magazines and I said, bring them back to me and I want to talk to you about them after you've read them.
[00:28:32.139 --> 00:28:35.681]  He brought them back and we had about a 30 minute talk on my front porch.
[00:28:36.702 --> 00:28:43.084]  And he was well, he was blown away because I think that he didn't know much about this.
[00:28:43.084 --> 00:28:48.346]  I gave him my password and username to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:28:48.346 --> 00:28:49.786]  Good job.
[00:28:49.786 --> 00:28:54.948]  And he said he was going to go and share it with his troop.
[00:28:54.948 --> 00:28:57.409]  Well, listen, it sounds like I'm kissing up to the police.
[00:28:58.688 --> 00:28:59.288]  But I'm not.
[00:28:59.288 --> 00:29:01.069]  When they do bad stuff, I go after them.
[00:29:01.069 --> 00:29:03.990]  But the good example, I uphold.
[00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:08.932]  On average, the police are more informed and ready to be informed than the general public.
[00:29:08.932 --> 00:29:10.552]  Because on average, they're not bad people.
[00:29:10.552 --> 00:29:14.093]  And they've already got questions about things.
[00:29:14.093 --> 00:29:16.034]  It's just that they don't really have the answers.
[00:29:16.034 --> 00:29:18.095]  And if you get them information,
[00:29:18.695 --> 00:29:21.998]  Like the Navy SEALs coming out and saying they're being trained to take guns.
[00:29:21.998 --> 00:29:25.620]  Or, you know, how foreign banks run the Federal Reserve.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.302]  They will really listen, on average.
[00:29:27.302 --> 00:29:32.226]  Or, if they freak out on you, you know they're run by the Southern Property Law Center slash ADL.
[00:29:32.226 --> 00:29:33.847]  So very exciting, great job.
[00:29:33.847 --> 00:29:35.188]  Jonathan, keep it up.
[00:29:35.188 --> 00:29:36.029]  Engage.
[00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:37.510]  Wake up decision makers.
[00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.032]  Wake up police and military.
[00:29:40.032 --> 00:29:41.593]  That's who they're going to try to use against us.
[00:29:41.593 --> 00:29:43.315]  We don't want to have a civil war with them.
[00:29:43.315 --> 00:29:44.656]  That's a globalist battle plan.
[00:29:44.656 --> 00:29:48.640]  Gordon, Sal, Brian, everybody's coming up.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.541]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:50.902]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.902 --> 00:29:53.424]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:56.107]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:11.908]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.

[00:30:59.961 --> 00:31:04.266]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[00:31:04.266 --> 00:31:10.153]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere, and the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[00:31:10.153 --> 00:31:15.980]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.484]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.
[00:31:19.884 --> 00:31:27.073]  Supernatural Silver offers a safe and effective means of fighting pathogens and can help defeat the root of these problems.

[00:32:00.305 --> 00:32:06.948]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:06.948 --> 00:32:12.090]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:20.814]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:20.814 --> 00:32:24.896]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:32:24.896 --> 00:32:27.177]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:32:29.178 --> 00:32:33.920]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.741]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:32:37.741 --> 00:32:38.981]  Others don't.
[00:32:38.981 --> 00:32:41.122]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:41.122 --> 00:32:42.903]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:42.903 --> 00:32:45.784]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[00:32:55.107 --> 00:32:57.488]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:32:57.488 --> 00:32:58.348]  Others don't.
[00:33:16.258 --> 00:33:22.979]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.979 --> 00:33:25.220]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.080]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:35.702]  Promoting freedom and dignity for humanity worldwide.
[00:33:35.702 --> 00:33:42.083]  Coming to you from the Infowars.com studios in Austin, Texas, I am your host,
[00:33:44.028 --> 00:33:47.830]  Alright, listen, I haven't gotten into all the news, and there's a ton of it.
[00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:50.651]  I've got the 70-plus page report.
[00:33:50.651 --> 00:33:55.774]  Research designed for the multi-market study of critical information needs.
[00:33:55.774 --> 00:33:57.415]  That's what Cass Sunstein said they would do.
[00:33:57.415 --> 00:34:02.437]  They would use regular regulations and agencies and call it something non-threatening.
[00:34:02.437 --> 00:34:03.838]  Like, oh, Affordable Care Act!
[00:34:04.298 --> 00:34:08.541]  You like your 539% increase in Texas?
[00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:10.622]  220-something in California on average?
[00:34:10.622 --> 00:34:13.104]  This isn't just 100% increases.
[00:34:13.104 --> 00:34:15.606]  That's what I was giving conservative numbers.
[00:34:15.606 --> 00:34:20.048]  It looks like they're going to go ahead and double or triple or quadruple right up front.
[00:34:20.048 --> 00:34:22.110]  Because the public loves being abused.
[00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.131]  Why not?
[00:34:23.131 --> 00:34:25.912]  The paramilitary standing by if you don't like it.
[00:34:25.912 --> 00:34:27.954]  So continuing here, April 2013,
[00:34:31.033 --> 00:34:38.877]  And when you get into the report I'm going to be covering, what is it, on page 23, it says they're going to go assess and make sure we're not being politically incorrect.
[00:34:38.877 --> 00:34:47.942]  And this is the map to roll out the FCC, the internet, print media, TV, cable, not just broadcast, everything.
[00:34:47.942 --> 00:34:57.326]  And you've got, what is it, last time, I think we wrote an article a couple years ago, it was like two years ago, I think the headline was, More Democratic Senators Join Call for Fairness Doctrine.
[00:34:57.326 --> 00:35:00.248]  And I think it was like ten of them last time I checked.
[00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:04.332]  He actually said we need to shut down hate radio.
[00:35:04.332 --> 00:35:05.514]  Well, I mean, let me be honest.
[00:35:05.514 --> 00:35:08.016]  I do love my family, so I do hate you.
[00:35:08.016 --> 00:35:09.118]  But it's beyond hate now.
[00:35:09.118 --> 00:35:17.487]  It's more of... I'm more horrified of you, but not like in a fearful way, like... It's horrifying to see a dog get run over by a car.
[00:35:19.577 --> 00:35:23.480]  It's even more horrifying to see a human hurt.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.744]  Even though I've seen lots of violence in my life, real and simulated, my empathy becomes more intense, not less intense.
[00:35:29.744 --> 00:35:31.265]  But they've got the big studies out.
[00:35:31.265 --> 00:35:33.086]  The general public is very desensitized.
[00:35:33.086 --> 00:35:36.188]  In fact, people now laugh at seeing people being run over.
[00:35:36.188 --> 00:35:36.949]  In the real world!
[00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.533]  Because it makes them feel important and powerful.
[00:35:40.533 --> 00:35:45.958]  And that's the new man that's supposed to go into the New World Order future.
[00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:47.060]  I don't think it's a new man.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.825]  I think it's basically the coming of the Zombotron.
[00:35:54.335 --> 00:35:55.716]  But again, we're opening the phones up.
[00:35:55.716 --> 00:35:57.958]  When you hear someone hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[00:35:57.958 --> 00:35:59.039]  We're not screening your calls.
[00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:02.642]  You just get about 45 seconds, so make your points.
[00:36:02.642 --> 00:36:03.983]  800-259-9231.
[00:36:03.983 --> 00:36:05.584]  800-259-9231.
[00:36:05.584 --> 00:36:12.490]  DHS approves over 80% of DREAMers who apply for legal status.
[00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.470]  There you go.
[00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.273]  And folks, let me explain something.
[00:36:16.273 --> 00:36:20.276]  Obama lets go almost all the illegal aliens that they pick up.
[00:36:20.276 --> 00:36:21.176]  They put a few
[00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:31.310]  In detention centers that they admit under the Emergency Centers Establishment Act are just being primed and pumped with illegals for the general public.
[00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:40.412]  But that is being reported by the Washington Free Beacon and others directly from DHS's own admissions.
[00:36:40.412 --> 00:36:47.455]  And again, my whole point is just like homes in Detroit, homes in Atlanta, homes in Austin, some of them got over $80 million.
[00:36:49.909 --> 00:37:02.313]  Per household in fake tax refunds and then no one gets in trouble because those are being sent to mafia groups through the Democratic Party Chicago mafia compound.
[00:37:02.313 --> 00:37:04.334]  Combine.
[00:37:04.334 --> 00:37:05.575]  And so you see to know that.
[00:37:05.575 --> 00:37:09.936]  So my whole deal is this is going to be the black market for the new world order.
[00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:12.117]  It's just that you're not going to get to be part of it.
[00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:20.539]  Unless you are part of the Latin American train that they're going to use economically to break North America.
[00:37:20.539 --> 00:37:21.981]  And it's not meant to help these folks.
[00:37:21.981 --> 00:37:26.147]  Once they're done, you know, they'll have a new slave population up here.
[00:37:26.147 --> 00:37:30.232]  While they try to reduce population in Latin America with the steroids and the Gardasil shots and the rest of it.
[00:37:31.033 --> 00:37:37.354]  They can bring up an excess population here to replace the baby boomers who have 1.3 children on average and who are dying out.
[00:37:37.354 --> 00:37:39.374]  The population that was here previously.
[00:37:39.374 --> 00:37:41.935]  So there'll be a new slave population.
[00:37:41.935 --> 00:37:49.436]  But right now, again, just like a mousetrap that has a piece of cheese on it, the incentive is the free welfare and the double standard and all of it.
[00:37:49.436 --> 00:37:50.796]  It's total discrimination.
[00:37:50.796 --> 00:37:57.758]  That's why MSNBC and other enemy platforms promote constantly, you know, you will support the free healthcare of your racists.
[00:37:57.758 --> 00:37:59.678]  You will support open borders of your racists.
[00:37:59.678 --> 00:37:59.978]  We're like,
[00:38:00.598 --> 00:38:02.098]  Look at all the economic actuaries.
[00:38:02.098 --> 00:38:03.899]  This will drive down wages even more.
[00:38:03.899 --> 00:38:05.979]  Obamacare, everybody will go to part-time.
[00:38:05.979 --> 00:38:07.220]  Then you'll have to go on welfare.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.460]  Now that's official.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.941]  And it's going to bankrupt things even faster.
[00:38:09.941 --> 00:38:11.621]  And it doesn't give you free health care.
[00:38:11.621 --> 00:38:15.642]  I mean, if you thought the Affordable Care Act was great, just wait till it's free!
[00:38:15.642 --> 00:38:19.023]  Because you know, it's supposedly going to be free soon.
[00:38:19.023 --> 00:38:20.143]  Yeah, free to bankrupt you.
[00:38:20.143 --> 00:38:24.304]  I mean, you're going to be free to go die in a ditch, I guess.
[00:38:24.304 --> 00:38:27.425]  But see, it'll take a few years to fully bankrupt everything.
[00:38:27.425 --> 00:38:28.986]  And then you're going to get your medicine.
[00:38:28.986 --> 00:38:30.126]  They're going to give you pain pills.
[00:38:31.783 --> 00:38:37.847]  When you need heart surgery or whatever, knee surgery, and you could just, you could just die.
[00:38:37.847 --> 00:38:41.590]  So, and the rich will be able to go get their private clinic healthcare.
[00:38:42.452 --> 00:38:48.857]  That aren't in the dirty buildings, in the dirty hospitals, and with all the deadly bugs in them, and it'll cost ten times what it does now.
[00:38:48.857 --> 00:38:50.999]  They've already done this model in some European countries.
[00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:54.382]  And you'll be able, if you're really rich, you'll be able to go get a lot of incredible stuff.
[00:38:54.382 --> 00:38:55.523]  And that's how it's all set up.
[00:38:55.523 --> 00:39:00.046]  Because the general public's not going to get the life extension technologies.
[00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:02.208]  Get that through your brain.
[00:39:02.208 --> 00:39:10.695]  The foreign banks that run these suicide compounds in China, and the mobile execution vans, when they're in control, that's what they do.
[00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:15.853]  When they protest in Mexico, they machine gun men, women, and children.
[00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:23.742]  And then Mexico says, be loving, don't be racist, let all our people up there, because the Mexican government is going to deal with the globalists to bring down the entire North American system.
[00:39:25.489 --> 00:39:33.495]  The Mexican government, who has the nickname for the general Mexican population of cockroaches, that's well known in Spanish, absolutely hates their people.
[00:39:33.495 --> 00:39:34.535]  I love their people.
[00:39:34.535 --> 00:39:36.236]  I don't want them to abort their children.
[00:39:36.236 --> 00:39:39.018]  I don't want their children to take the Gardasil that sterilizes them.
[00:39:39.018 --> 00:39:49.966]  I want to see them industrialized and advanced and bring them up because I am a human with a big fat loving soul who wants to lift people up because I know it lifts me up.
[00:39:49.966 --> 00:39:51.247]  When they fall, I fall.
[00:39:53.078 --> 00:39:54.639]  I'm the real liberal.
[00:39:54.639 --> 00:39:59.243]  These people running the system are absolute eugenicists, hellbent to enslave us.
[00:39:59.243 --> 00:40:03.607]  And if you haven't figured that out yet, folks, you better figure it out real quick.
[00:40:03.607 --> 00:40:07.810]  All right, let's stop right there and go back to the phone calls, as promised.
[00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.932]  Gordon in Canada, you're next up.
[00:40:09.932 --> 00:40:12.113]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:40:12.113 --> 00:40:13.414]  Hey Alex, you're on fire today.
[00:40:13.414 --> 00:40:15.036]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:40:16.209 --> 00:40:18.129]  Yeah, a couple of quick points Alex.
[00:40:18.129 --> 00:40:25.431]  Do you remember a few months ago you mentioned these floods in High River in Alberta where the RCMP confiscated people's weapons while they were out of their homes?
[00:40:25.431 --> 00:40:29.391]  That's right, that was on record just like anywhere else in the world where the globalists control.
[00:40:29.391 --> 00:40:32.072]  Any type of disaster they take your weapons, yes.
[00:40:32.072 --> 00:40:42.974]  It's just a note Alex, it's been discovered they also confiscated over two tons of ammunition from people's homes and while there was a shortage of boats during the flood, they used these boats
[00:40:43.604 --> 00:40:46.705]  To go into people's homes and confiscate two tons of ammunition.
[00:40:46.705 --> 00:40:50.385]  They're just now reimbursing people for their smashed-in doors.
[00:40:50.385 --> 00:40:51.706]  Well, you know why they always do that.
[00:40:51.706 --> 00:40:56.707]  They want the troops and the police ready to confiscate guns at any chance they have.
[00:40:56.707 --> 00:40:58.847]  They always try to take them.
[00:40:58.847 --> 00:41:01.307]  You can be in a high and dry area with your own generator.
[00:41:01.307 --> 00:41:03.088]  That's the first house they're coming to.
[00:41:03.088 --> 00:41:06.448]  And it's to test who will follow the orders.
[00:41:06.448 --> 00:41:08.969]  And so, it's part of the cultural shift.
[00:41:10.569 --> 00:41:12.932]  Alex, I just want to say one more quick thing.
[00:41:12.932 --> 00:41:14.874]  There's more people awake every day.
[00:41:14.874 --> 00:41:19.399]  It is coming to a conclusion sometime in the future.
[00:41:19.399 --> 00:41:21.922]  Are you a science fiction fan, Alex?
[00:41:21.922 --> 00:41:26.026]  I am a science fiction fan, back when I had time to read The Greats.
[00:41:26.026 --> 00:41:29.550]  Well, movies, I can't help but feel what's happening now.
[00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.933]  Do you remember at the end of the first Star Wars movie?
[00:41:32.495 --> 00:41:41.262]  Where the X-Wing fighters are coming in and the lieutenant goes up to the Death Star commander, I think it was played by Peter Cushing, and he said, you know, we better evacuate.
[00:41:41.262 --> 00:41:42.544]  These guys are onto something.
[00:41:42.544 --> 00:41:45.526]  Do you remember what Peter Cushing said?
[00:41:45.526 --> 00:41:48.268]  He said, evacuate in our moment of triumph.
[00:41:48.268 --> 00:41:50.350]  I think you overestimate their chances.
[00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:52.092]  I think, I really feel that.
[00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:54.093]  Evacuate in our moment of triumph?
[00:41:54.093 --> 00:41:56.355]  I think you overestimate their chances.
[00:41:56.355 --> 00:41:58.797]  I love that scene, Alex.
[00:41:58.797 --> 00:42:00.699]  It's why the Greeks and
[00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:11.199]  The Great American Authors and Shakespeare wrote about arrogance and hubris is because it will be the downfall of people who try to take control without honor.
[00:42:11.199 --> 00:42:13.541]  Several fighters have broken off from the main group.
[00:42:13.541 --> 00:42:14.102]  Come with me.
[00:42:14.102 --> 00:42:15.343]  All right, brother.
[00:42:15.343 --> 00:42:15.944]  God bless you.
[00:42:15.944 --> 00:42:17.805]  I appreciate you calling in.
[00:42:17.805 --> 00:42:20.828]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Canada.
[00:42:20.828 --> 00:42:22.229]  Another call from Canada.
[00:42:22.229 --> 00:42:25.211]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:42:25.211 --> 00:42:25.832]  Alex, I
[00:42:28.388 --> 00:42:38.095]  I'm another one of those Canadians who love you to death up here, and I just wanted to say this is maybe a little bit off topic, but I guess I just wanted to share it with you.
[00:42:38.095 --> 00:42:41.777]  Your slogan says, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:42:41.777 --> 00:42:48.982]  And I just wondered, Alex, if you would share with your audience what your thoughts are with regard to mind versus brain.
[00:42:48.982 --> 00:42:52.224]  Is the mind the same as the brain in your estimation?
[00:42:52.224 --> 00:42:54.346]  I'll hang up and listen for your response, brother.
[00:42:54.346 --> 00:42:54.646]  Thank you.
[00:42:55.458 --> 00:43:15.035]  Well, you know, I'm no scientist, but I've read a lot of scientific reports and had a lot of top experts on, and I don't, you know, get into some of the areas where they can't completely prove everything, but throughout time and memorial, historians, researchers have pointed out that there's something, you know, more than just the brain.
[00:43:15.035 --> 00:43:16.897]  It's like they can do a perfect clone that's 100% the same,
[00:43:19.017 --> 00:43:21.719]  And for some reason, it just doesn't have the same vigor.
[00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:26.403]  It doesn't matter whether it's a lizard, whether it's a mammal, it just isn't the same.
[00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:29.626]  And we know that there are a sixth sense.
[00:43:29.626 --> 00:43:38.372]  We know there are magnetic cells in the brains, not just of mammals, but of birds and other fish.
[00:43:38.372 --> 00:43:39.693]  That's how they're able to navigate.
[00:43:39.693 --> 00:43:41.275]  It's how they're able to fly south for the winter.
[00:43:41.275 --> 00:43:45.518]  It's how a hummingbird can fly 5,000 miles.
[00:43:45.518 --> 00:43:47.379]  And now from science, they know that
[00:43:49.212 --> 00:43:55.497]  The brain is able to go into the fourth and fifth dimension in calculations that it's able to make.
[00:43:55.497 --> 00:43:57.979]  And, of course, we live in the third dimension.
[00:43:57.979 --> 00:44:00.081]  And we know when someone is looking at us.
[00:44:00.081 --> 00:44:00.561]  We feel it.
[00:44:00.561 --> 00:44:01.262]  I mean, it's a fact.
[00:44:01.262 --> 00:44:02.763]  It's been scientifically proven.
[00:44:02.763 --> 00:44:09.368]  People can tell when someone's through a brick wall on the other side in double-blind studies over and over again, even if they're not supposedly clairvoyant.
[00:44:09.368 --> 00:44:12.871]  Now, of course, there's a bunch of con artists and people out there jumping on that.
[00:44:14.363 --> 00:44:18.545]  But most of us have had dreams where exactly that dream comes true.
[00:44:18.545 --> 00:44:21.366]  Not like you dream of being a rock star and you become a rock star.
[00:44:21.366 --> 00:44:23.387]  I mean, you dream of being mugged.
[00:44:23.387 --> 00:44:24.068]  That's happened to me.
[00:44:24.068 --> 00:44:26.469]  And then six months later, whatever, the exact mugging happens.
[00:44:27.165 --> 00:44:34.390]  And it's like deja vu, and you don't even know what the person is going to do, and it's almost like your brain was able to jump forward into the future.
[00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:38.772]  It's not like deja vu where you think you've seen this before, you talk about it, you remember it, it's very upsetting.
[00:44:38.772 --> 00:44:42.695]  Those dreams are waking dreams is what I call them, where you know it's real.
[00:44:42.695 --> 00:44:44.876]  When I was a child, I had them obviously more.
[00:44:44.876 --> 00:44:46.858]  It's been marked throughout history that children are more.
[00:44:47.498 --> 00:44:48.158]  More sensitive.
[00:44:48.158 --> 00:44:51.139]  That's why the globals like to abuse and hurt them.
[00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:53.520]  Because, you know, the evil wants to feed on that.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.221]  But, I mean, I still have waking dreams.
[00:44:55.221 --> 00:44:56.241]  And you always know one.
[00:44:56.241 --> 00:44:57.862]  Even if it's something good coming.
[00:44:57.862 --> 00:45:01.983]  Like most of us, the most common waking dream is of your children unborn.
[00:45:01.983 --> 00:45:06.605]  Or a lot of times parents, when their children will have dreams about their grandchildren.
[00:45:06.605 --> 00:45:07.365]  That's very common.
[00:45:07.365 --> 00:45:12.387]  My dad had dreams about my daughters.
[00:45:13.516 --> 00:45:21.040]  And then only later went, oh my God, that was the little blonde haired girls I imagined that were going to be my children.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.300]  But I mean, it was exactly them.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:22.961]  That's the issue.
[00:45:22.961 --> 00:45:23.941]  It was later.
[00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:25.862]  He said, oh my gosh, that was that dream.
[00:45:25.862 --> 00:45:29.404]  Or as he told my mom about this, when they first got married, we're going to have daughters.
[00:45:29.404 --> 00:45:30.805]  I've seen these daughters.
[00:45:30.805 --> 00:45:32.245]  They weren't his daughters.
[00:45:32.245 --> 00:45:33.426]  They were his granddaughters.
[00:45:35.339 --> 00:45:36.359]  And the enemy knows this.
[00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:39.920]  That's why they don't want you to think there's anything else outside of what we can see.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.160]  We're like moles, folks.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.221]  We're blind.
[00:45:42.221 --> 00:45:43.841]  We have these five senses.
[00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:44.981]  We don't have five senses.
[00:45:44.981 --> 00:45:46.842]  We have six senses and beyond.
[00:45:46.842 --> 00:45:49.342]  We're in the universe.
[00:45:49.342 --> 00:45:52.103]  The time-space continuum flows directly through us.
[00:45:52.103 --> 00:45:54.564]  We're like hollow.
[00:45:54.564 --> 00:45:57.964]  Our bodies are very thin.
[00:45:57.964 --> 00:46:00.185]  We're made of stardust.
[00:46:00.185 --> 00:46:01.945]  We're made of the universe.
[00:46:01.945 --> 00:46:03.166]  We've always been here.
[00:46:03.166 --> 00:46:03.946]  It's unbelievable.
[00:46:07.756 --> 00:46:09.977]  That's why I'm not worried about the New World Order.
[00:46:09.977 --> 00:46:12.277]  I laugh at them because they're so pathetic.
[00:46:12.277 --> 00:46:14.078]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[00:46:14.078 --> 00:46:17.579]  Shal, in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:19.180]  Yes, hi Alex.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.760]  Long time listener.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.960]  Thank you for everything you've done.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:27.222]  You woke me up about six or seven years ago, and I've just been listening to you every day for the past year.
[00:46:27.222 --> 00:46:30.323]  I wanted to talk to you about the black box.
[00:46:31.785 --> 00:46:39.003]  Um, my friend showed me there's a commercial with Progressive Auto Insurance and SLO is promoting this little box.
[00:46:39.676 --> 00:46:42.077]  That you can put in your car.
[00:46:42.077 --> 00:46:42.698]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:46:42.698 --> 00:46:44.218]  Progressive's done that for 10 years.
[00:46:44.218 --> 00:46:46.940]  They're paid by the Feds as a beta test.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.360]  Also in Europe under another name.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.401]  I forget their European division name.
[00:46:50.401 --> 00:46:54.163]  And what they do is, you put the box in and they give you discounts.
[00:46:54.163 --> 00:46:55.884]  But in the future, you won't have a choice.
[00:46:55.884 --> 00:46:59.826]  And then the box will track everything you do and give you wireless tickets.
[00:46:59.826 --> 00:47:01.707]  And that's all been officially announced.
[00:47:01.707 --> 00:47:05.669]  So now the same Progressive box, but more advanced, is in all the new cars starting in 2011.
[00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:11.397]  And of course it was designed for that and we told people that and they said the government would never do that.
[00:47:11.397 --> 00:47:12.598]  Conspiracy theorist.
[00:47:12.598 --> 00:47:18.768]  Instead of getting together to beat it and say no, the yuppies with their knowledge, you know, because they live in a fantasy land.
[00:47:19.744 --> 00:47:21.846]  They just tell us that we're liars.
[00:47:21.846 --> 00:47:23.848]  They didn't oppose it, so now it's going to begin.
[00:47:23.848 --> 00:47:26.951]  And then the yuppies will say, well, we need highway money.
[00:47:26.951 --> 00:47:28.773]  The highway department said they're bankrupt.
[00:47:28.773 --> 00:47:39.043]  When the highway departments are making more money than they've ever made, on an average, over 75% of all tax money is sent and invested in offshore banks and then destroyed as derivatives.
[00:47:39.503 --> 00:47:40.985]  You're like, well, why don't they take the money?
[00:47:40.985 --> 00:47:42.126]  They have unlimited money.
[00:47:42.126 --> 00:47:44.988]  The only way they get value in money is destroying your money.
[00:47:44.988 --> 00:47:50.674]  The IRS is not meant to pay off the national debt, as Reagan's commission showed in 81.
[00:47:50.674 --> 00:47:59.743]  100% of it is taken and put into the fiat debt on the money, not the actual debt, but on the interest on it, to destroy you.
[00:48:00.933 --> 00:48:05.176]  Just like the Communist Manifesto says, a progressive, heavy income tax.
[00:48:05.176 --> 00:48:07.698]  That is a Karl Marx deal.
[00:48:07.698 --> 00:48:12.381]  And so, it is a fact, on record, that it is to destroy us.
[00:48:12.381 --> 00:48:15.543]  What's the Italian, or Latin, destruto?
[00:48:15.543 --> 00:48:16.504]  Is that right?
[00:48:16.504 --> 00:48:18.325]  What's Latin for destroyed?
[00:48:18.325 --> 00:48:20.166]  They want to destroy you.
[00:48:20.166 --> 00:48:20.767]  Anything else, sir?
[00:48:21.943 --> 00:48:22.803]  Yes, one other thing.
[00:48:22.803 --> 00:48:25.965]  I just want to tell you that I'm doing my part in Florida to wake people up.
[00:48:25.965 --> 00:48:28.906]  I'm talking and having conversations with people.
[00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:31.348]  And it's really tough, but I'm just doing my job.
[00:48:31.348 --> 00:48:37.371]  And I'm finding these, it's weird, I'm finding these government employees, you know, they're working for the spy.
[00:48:37.371 --> 00:48:40.212]  I'm talking to a husband and then his wife is a spy for
[00:48:41.072 --> 00:48:44.134]  She's observing people's behavior.
[00:48:44.134 --> 00:48:47.757]  I'm trying to guess what department, and then he says Department of Homeland Security.
[00:48:47.757 --> 00:48:50.238]  She's observing people's behavior.
[00:48:50.238 --> 00:48:56.482]  Another girl I met at Hertz, she's an NSA, got her master's in NSA spying.
[00:48:56.482 --> 00:49:01.446]  I'm like, and I'm trying to talk to these people and tell them... Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, that's it!
[00:49:01.446 --> 00:49:04.908]  The majority of scholarships now are in the control grid.
[00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:08.951]  That's how they're making the economy that, and then they control that economy with your tax money.
[00:49:09.771 --> 00:49:17.493]  And it's all in data mining, spying, and yes, we have conservatively five times the number of human spies on the ground.
[00:49:17.493 --> 00:49:19.353]  All the kid toys are about spying.
[00:49:19.353 --> 00:49:22.454]  They teach them, spy on your parents in school for at least 20 years.
[00:49:22.454 --> 00:49:25.475]  They teach them your parents don't know anything in Time Magazine for kids.
[00:49:25.475 --> 00:49:27.335]  They've said your parents are, you know, dumb.
[00:49:27.335 --> 00:49:28.316]  It actually says that.
[00:49:28.316 --> 00:49:29.276]  You're going to take a chip.
[00:49:29.276 --> 00:49:30.476]  You're going to show them.
[00:49:30.476 --> 00:49:34.657]  That was like 10 years ago or 11 years ago in Time Magazine for kids.
[00:49:34.657 --> 00:49:35.497]  God bless you.
[00:49:35.497 --> 00:49:36.397]  I appreciate your call.
[00:49:36.397 --> 00:49:38.118]  It is total weaponization.
[00:49:39.193 --> 00:49:39.714]  Of course not.
[00:49:55.658 --> 00:50:00.721]  If you start arguing with them, I have an eight hour course in training your body language.
[00:50:00.721 --> 00:50:02.522]  I think you're a danger.
[00:50:02.522 --> 00:50:03.582]  We're going to have you searched.
[00:50:03.582 --> 00:50:04.843]  No judge, no jury.
[00:50:04.843 --> 00:50:14.068]  Now, some literal blob has an eight hour course and now they, they magically know what you're thinking.
[00:50:14.068 --> 00:50:20.972]  You are also reminded that any inappropriate remarks or jokes concerning security may result in your arrest.
[00:50:21.638 --> 00:50:24.740]  We appreciate your cooperation while these measures are in effect.
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:30.923]  Please cooperate while we take naked pictures of you and your family and stick our hands down your pants and grab your genitals.
[00:50:30.923 --> 00:50:37.746]  Please comply, because we've got to get you under wraps and ready to shut down the economy, get rid of the free market, and make you dumb and poor.
[00:50:37.746 --> 00:50:39.127]  Are you ready?
[00:50:39.127 --> 00:50:40.027]  Yes, we are!
[00:50:40.027 --> 00:50:41.087]  We're trendy!
[00:50:41.087 --> 00:50:41.988]  We'll comply!
[00:50:41.988 --> 00:50:43.529]  And they're like, good!
[00:50:43.529 --> 00:50:46.690]  Complying is how you get goodies.
[00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:48.651]  Here's an aspartame lollipop.
[00:50:48.651 --> 00:50:49.812]  Do you like brain damage?
[00:50:50.646 --> 00:50:54.332]  Do you like early onset of Parkinson's?
[00:50:54.332 --> 00:50:56.254]  How about infertility?
[00:50:56.254 --> 00:50:59.459]  And if you really want to die, we have mercury shots that are good for you.
[00:51:01.601 --> 00:51:03.202]  Time and time again.
[00:51:03.202 --> 00:51:06.145]  You need to come here and help us.
[00:51:06.145 --> 00:51:07.606]  We need assistance.
[00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:08.407]  Please!
[00:51:08.407 --> 00:51:11.710]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:15.693]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[00:51:15.693 --> 00:51:18.396]  While the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:51:18.396 --> 00:51:20.918]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:51:20.918 --> 00:51:24.501]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.
[00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:27.963]  We are hurting down here and we need help!
[00:51:47.172 --> 00:51:48.073]  Immediately!
[00:51:48.073 --> 00:51:52.858]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.

[00:51:59.893 --> 00:52:01.014]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:52:01.014 --> 00:52:05.496]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:52:05.496 --> 00:52:11.219]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:52:11.219 --> 00:52:13.380]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.801]  No word about IRAs.
[00:52:14.801 --> 00:52:17.463]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:52:17.463 --> 00:52:22.425]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:52:44.095 --> 00:52:47.676]  Propane tanks are a hassle, and lighter fluid and gas can be dangerous.

[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:04.827]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:53:04.827 --> 00:53:12.215]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:53:12.215 --> 00:53:15.378]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:53:15.518 --> 00:53:17.539]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:53:17.539 --> 00:53:22.200]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.101]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:31.063]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:53:31.063 --> 00:53:34.744]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:53:34.744 --> 00:53:39.985]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:53:39.985 --> 00:53:42.926]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:53:43.166 --> 00:53:49.151]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:53:49.151 --> 00:53:51.313]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:54:21.221 --> 00:54:23.582]  And we all have a role to play.
[00:54:23.582 --> 00:54:27.124]  Working together, we can all help secure our country.
[00:54:27.124 --> 00:54:32.907]  If you see something, say something.
[00:54:32.907 --> 00:54:38.789]  Always contact local law enforcement whenever you observe suspicious indicators or behaviors.
[00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:50.015]  If you see your neighbor loading a deer rifle in their car, and it's totally legal, if you call us, we always come and SWAT team, take their guns, put them in prison, and sometimes even shoot them dead in their garages.
[00:54:50.535 --> 00:54:52.635]  We do it almost every day nationwide.
[00:54:52.635 --> 00:54:54.916]  Give us an excuse to kill your neighbors.
[00:54:54.916 --> 00:54:56.216]  Call us today.
[00:54:56.216 --> 00:55:13.900]  But if you see foreign banks raping the country financially, shutting everything down, illegal spying, the government caught shipping in, billions of dollars of narcotics every week, 500 billion dollars a year, major banks publicly laundering the money, giant private prisons being built everywhere, if you see that, don't say anything.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:26.531]  And if you see the army saying, you're not allowed to be a Christian, an evangelical, if we catch you going to a church and tithing at one, we're going to arrest you on terrorism charges, and that comes out, and it's not even newsworthy.
[00:55:26.531 --> 00:55:30.194]  You know, if you see something like that, don't say anything.
[00:55:30.194 --> 00:55:31.635]  Because everything's fine, folks.
[00:55:31.635 --> 00:55:32.436]  The globalists love us.
[00:55:34.775 --> 00:55:58.041]  I got Max Keiser coming up, and then I've got the fellow that wrote the book and then worked on the film, The Secret History of the United States, Oliver Stone's partner in that, Dr. Peter Kuznick, pretty famous fellow, be interesting, he joins us, the author of The Untold History of America, I was going from memory, a good name would be The Secret History of the U.S., I think that's another book, but the point is, Untold History of America.
[00:55:59.375 --> 00:56:02.178]  Or maybe it was that Stone called his TV show, Secret History.
[00:56:02.178 --> 00:56:02.918]  I forget.
[00:56:02.918 --> 00:56:07.282]  The point is, he's going to be popping in, and we'll continue with your phone calls.
[00:56:07.282 --> 00:56:07.983]  I think I did pretty good.
[00:56:07.983 --> 00:56:12.707]  I think I got like 12 calls or so, not as many as I wanted, but that's pretty epic for me actually getting the calls.
[00:56:12.707 --> 00:56:14.048]  We're going to go back to them here in just a moment.
[00:56:15.729 --> 00:56:17.350]  More of it came in a few days ago.
[00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:18.770]  That's been shipped out.
[00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:19.771]  More comes in today.
[00:56:19.771 --> 00:56:22.672]  They're trickling it out as the laboratory can produce it.
[00:56:22.672 --> 00:56:25.333]  It's a patented system of nascent iodine.

[00:57:07.839 --> 00:57:21.495]  We should have enough in by next week because we have a big shipment today via UPS and then we have another shipment next week to fulfill the back orders that have come in up until, well into next week.
[00:57:21.495 --> 00:57:25.619]  So those of you that are back ordered, it is coming and we appreciate your patience.

[00:57:40.471 --> 00:57:44.513]  So you should expect delivery in two to three weeks if you order now and get in line to do that.

[01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:10.714]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:19.256]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.256 --> 01:00:22.277]  Folks, the story's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:29.671]  Last remaining lead smelter in the USA closing after 120 years.
[01:00:29.671 --> 01:00:32.832]  They have shut down the environmental regulations to where it's impossible.
[01:00:32.832 --> 01:00:37.334]  It's like Obama said, you can have a coal-powered plant, but we will bankrupt you.
[01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:38.875]  It's impossible to lead smell.
[01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:41.235]  That's why we imported all from China now.
[01:00:41.235 --> 01:00:42.776]  And now they're going to control the importation.
[01:00:42.776 --> 01:00:45.637]  That's how they're going to ban your bullets.
[01:00:45.637 --> 01:00:47.378]  And they're not playing games.
[01:00:48.487 --> 01:00:49.528]  So, there you go.
[01:00:49.528 --> 01:00:54.390]  And they're going to go after every other metal you try to use for bullets, and they're going to buy them up to drive up the prices.
[01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:55.911]  This is economic warfare.
[01:00:55.911 --> 01:01:02.174]  Max Keiser getting into money velocity, and how bad it's going to get, because it is starting to get out in the economy.
[01:01:02.174 --> 01:01:03.375]  I see inflation everywhere.
[01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:04.075]  It's really bad.
[01:01:04.075 --> 01:01:07.537]  And the media says, there's no inflation, there's no inflation.
[01:01:07.537 --> 01:01:10.119]  The dinosaur, kleptocrat, Decepticon media.
[01:01:11.397 --> 01:01:22.669]  How does that tie into, not just Chase, but other big banks, are saying, you can wire money in, but not out of the country, and you've got to get an approved special checking account and pay us.
[01:01:22.669 --> 01:01:31.779]  And you said this years ago, it would get to the point before the inflation really got bad, where your money will be like garbage you've got to pay to have taken away, Max Keiser.
[01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.712]  Well, there's a couple of things there, Alex.
[01:01:35.712 --> 01:01:48.100]  First of all, you have to understand that although the inflation rate right now is high, if you put into the calculation things like food and energy, the inflation rate is really 6, 7, 8%.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.662]  It's not the 2 or 2.5% the government says.
[01:01:50.662 --> 01:01:59.748]  The government lies about the real number of inflation because all of the entitlement programs are tied to the official inflation rate, that being like Social Security.
[01:01:59.748 --> 01:02:02.930]  So they're incentivized to under-report that number.
[01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:03.550]  I don't
[01:02:19.244 --> 01:02:19.745]  I think?
[01:02:34.281 --> 01:02:49.575]  The derivatives shadow banking system is collapsing, and that's why these banks have to constantly be bailed out by the central banks, who are constantly engaged in programs of quantitative easing, because they're trying to keep what are called zombie banks alive.
[01:02:49.575 --> 01:02:58.163]  And the reason they're zombie banks is because their balance sheets are collapsing faster than the economy can grow to generate the taxable income to pay off these debts.
[01:02:58.743 --> 01:03:18.615]  Now going forward, because there is no velocity, because there are so many zombie banks, because there is so much money just sitting there not doing anything because they're zombies, you have countries like China that have accumulated up to four trillion dollars worth of money as a credit donation, including over a trillion dollars in dollars, with nowhere to spend it.
[01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:20.976]  Until such time as they decide to
[01:03:22.017 --> 01:03:39.767]  Get panic-stricken because maybe the dollar finally starts to collapse in the wake of this obvious sign of no economic growth and they dump those dollars and other currencies onto the market in a classic hyperinflation where they want to spend them quickly before the value collapses.
[01:03:39.767 --> 01:03:42.729]  Then all this pent-up hyperinflation
[01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:47.571]  Is there any way to escape the Weimar because the globalists admit and they're double speak that they're trying to have a depression
[01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:08.900]  To somehow black hole the inflation, so they only have inflation in luxury goods, and we see that.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:09.861]  No, no, no.
[01:04:09.861 --> 01:04:12.082]  They say that there is deflation.
[01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:24.549]  They say that there is a recession, because they are constantly trying to convince people that they don't deserve to make a minimum wage or a livable wage.
[01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:29.291]  People at McDonald's and Walmart... Well, look at how they promoted Obamacare!
[01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:29.952]  ...by the U.S.
[01:04:29.952 --> 01:04:30.372]  government.
[01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:30.892]  That's right.
[01:04:30.892 --> 01:04:32.413]  They're being subsidized by the U.S.
[01:04:32.413 --> 01:04:41.639]  government because they must always talk about the collapse of the inflation, which they include wages, as the reason why they need to keep printing money.
[01:04:41.639 --> 01:04:43.140]  But that's a false statement.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.222]  They print the money to keep the zombie banks alive.
[01:04:45.222 --> 01:04:45.982]  They don't care.
[01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:50.005]  As I said before, they don't care if people have jobs because they can just print money.
[01:04:50.005 --> 01:04:51.446]  Why would I care if I had a job?
[01:04:51.446 --> 01:04:51.946]  Exactly.
[01:04:51.946 --> 01:04:53.227]  Max, thank you so much.
[01:04:53.227 --> 01:04:53.667]  We're out of time.
[01:04:53.667 --> 01:04:54.468]  I'll have you back soon.
[01:04:54.468 --> 01:04:55.088]  Thank you so much.

[01:04:57.921 --> 01:05:03.724]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:05:03.724 --> 01:05:11.108]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:14.450]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:16.211]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:05:16.471 --> 01:05:21.133]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:05:21.133 --> 01:05:24.034]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:05:24.034 --> 01:05:29.997]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:05:29.997 --> 01:05:33.678]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:05:33.678 --> 01:05:38.921]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:07.844]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:06:07.844 --> 01:06:14.228]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[01:07:53.557 --> 01:08:07.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:23.444]  Dr. Peter Kuznick is one of the most renowned historians and researchers out there, period.
[01:08:23.444 --> 01:08:27.006]  We're very honored to have him join us for the next 25 minutes or so.
[01:08:27.006 --> 01:08:38.455]  He also worked with his book, turning it into a 12-part series for television, 10 parts on cable here in the United States, for the untold history of the United States.
[01:08:38.455 --> 01:08:42.498]  And he just had a piece in USA Today about American exceptionalism.
[01:08:43.238 --> 01:08:52.460]  And we're going to get his take just on where America and the world is right now versus the different political histories that are out there.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:59.402]  And obviously we all see through rose-colored glasses and history's too big and too deep to ever really know the truth of everything.
[01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:07.164]  But we know there's a lot of different histories that are politicized out there versus what the real histories are.
[01:09:07.164 --> 01:09:10.044]  And so he joins us, Dr. Peter Kuznick.
[01:09:10.044 --> 01:09:11.545]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:09:11.545 --> 01:09:12.225]  My pleasure, Alex.
[01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:24.130]  Wow, I mean, we could talk about a million different things, but just studying history in its whole, where would you say the world is today, and where is America and the empire in that?
[01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:25.451]  Well, there have been a lot of empires.
[01:09:25.451 --> 01:09:30.635]  And what we know is that no empire lasts forever.
[01:09:30.635 --> 01:09:36.520]  And the United States is in a similar position to all the previous empires.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.702]  Empires cling to life.
[01:09:39.614 --> 01:09:41.075]  in their dying stages.
[01:09:41.075 --> 01:09:47.678]  The United States is not yet in its dying stages as an empire, but we're already retracting.
[01:09:47.678 --> 01:09:52.360]  We're already seeing that we can't dominate the world in the ways that we used to be able to.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:59.604]  You see America's declining influence in the Middle East, America's declining influence in Latin America.
[01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:05.149]  And this does not necessarily have to be a bad thing for the American people.
[01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:09.233]  Being the world's policeman has not been in America's interest.
[01:10:09.233 --> 01:10:13.877]  Even from a military standpoint, our victories have been minor.
[01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:19.722]  Yeah, we succeeded in defeating several dozen Cuban construction workers in Grenada.
[01:10:19.722 --> 01:10:23.406]  And Reagan says, America's back again, standing proud.
[01:10:23.406 --> 01:10:25.527]  But we haven't had a very good track record.
[01:10:25.527 --> 01:10:27.129]  The Korean War was a standoff.
[01:10:28.096 --> 01:10:30.018]  Vietnam was a disaster.
[01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:33.340]  We got our butts kicked in Vietnam.
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:42.807]  Kuwait, you could say, was somewhat of a success, but there again we were lied into that war the first time.
[01:10:42.807 --> 01:10:47.971]  Afghanistan, Iraq, even Libya.
[01:10:47.971 --> 01:10:51.033]  I mean, what has our militarism got us?
[01:10:51.033 --> 01:10:52.374]  Okay, we've got 700 to 1,000 bases around the world.
[01:10:54.699 --> 01:10:57.261]  We are by far the strongest nation in the world.
[01:10:57.261 --> 01:11:00.683]  We spend almost as much on our military as the rest of the world combined.
[01:11:00.683 --> 01:11:05.545]  If we factor in our intelligence, for a while we were spending as much as the rest of the world combined.
[01:11:05.545 --> 01:11:15.151]  So we've militarized the planet, and we're looking for military solutions, but we've seen over and over again that military solutions don't really work.
[01:11:15.151 --> 01:11:21.415]  So what Oliver Stone and I have tried to do with our project is show the dark side of American history.
[01:11:21.415 --> 01:11:23.736]  We acknowledge that the United States has done a lot of great things.
[01:11:24.491 --> 01:11:27.214]  But we don't think we learned the lessons from that.
[01:11:27.214 --> 01:11:35.221]  The lessons we want to teach, we think that are most essential for people to learn, are the lessons from the mistakes that we've made.
[01:11:35.221 --> 01:11:38.164]  And Americans have not been good at reflecting.
[01:11:38.164 --> 01:11:40.446]  And one of the problems is Americans don't know their history.
[01:11:41.457 --> 01:11:50.961]  The National Report Card that was issued in June of 2011 reported that American high school seniors came in worst in U.S.
[01:11:50.961 --> 01:11:53.662]  history than they did in any other subject.
[01:11:53.662 --> 01:11:56.043]  In fact, they are worse in their understanding of U.S.
[01:11:56.043 --> 01:11:57.844]  history than they are in math and science.
[01:11:57.844 --> 01:12:03.006]  We're always bemoaning the fact that our students are so inept in math and science compared to the rest of the world.
[01:12:03.006 --> 01:12:04.426]  Well, the students came in worse in U.S.
[01:12:04.426 --> 01:12:05.327]  history.
[01:12:05.327 --> 01:12:08.648]  Twelve percent of American high school seniors were judged to be proficient.
[01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:09.934]  I think so.
[01:12:30.626 --> 01:12:32.267]  Well, I've seen some of the episodes.
[01:12:32.267 --> 01:12:37.211]  They're really thought-provoking and try to give some depth, not just black or white.
[01:12:37.211 --> 01:12:43.255]  I see America becoming an empire really around the time Kennedy's killed, and a lot of historians agree with me on that.
[01:12:43.255 --> 01:12:44.216]  I want to see if you agree.
[01:12:44.216 --> 01:12:52.622]  I mean, it's hard to pick a point, but America has lost its superpower status and is now seen as a super tyranny because
[01:12:53.963 --> 01:12:56.665]  All these corporate interests, they're winning off the profits.
[01:12:56.665 --> 01:12:59.707]  They're winning off of the no-bid contracts.
[01:12:59.707 --> 01:13:01.889]  But America is being destroyed.
[01:13:01.889 --> 01:13:05.752]  Our name, our treasure, everything in the process.
[01:13:05.752 --> 01:13:10.876]  And then Putin came out and said, you know, you're not just exceptional because you say you are.
[01:13:10.876 --> 01:13:17.842]  I see America has been exceptional in many ways with inventions and trailblazing, but also exceptional in darkness as well.
[01:13:19.202 --> 01:13:21.083]  And I think you always see that yin and yang.
[01:13:21.083 --> 01:13:31.006]  I mean, I would say America has been exceptional in many ways, but now we're exceptionally unhealthy, exceptionally evil, and exceptionally arrogant.
[01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:34.167]  And I think it's good for us to not be so arrogant.
[01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:36.688]  And what is your take on American exceptionalism?
[01:13:36.688 --> 01:13:40.329]  Because I know you wrote a big piece that I was able to read part of on it.
[01:13:40.329 --> 01:13:41.650]  I saw a synopsis from another paper.
[01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:46.071]  I had a piece on American exceptionalism in USA Today a few days ago.
[01:13:47.054 --> 01:14:06.711]  And we started by thanking Vladimir Putin for not just chastising Barack Obama for invoking American exceptionalism to justify a unilateral military strike against Syria, but for offering a solution so the United States didn't have to follow through on that promise.
[01:14:06.711 --> 01:14:08.333]  But we argued that
[01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:11.171]  What Putin did was right.
[01:14:11.171 --> 01:14:12.812]  His timing was bad.
[01:14:12.812 --> 01:14:28.142]  We had wished that he had waited another week until both houses of Congress had repudiated a military strike, a cruise missile strike against Syria, because we thought that that would have sent the real message about where the United States people want to be right now.
[01:14:28.142 --> 01:14:30.764]  They were overwhelmingly opposed to a military strike.
[01:14:30.764 --> 01:14:36.748]  It would have been a tremendous victory for the anti-war movement, probably the biggest victory in decades.
[01:14:37.475 --> 01:14:44.341]  But this idea of exceptionalism is so deeply ingrained, it's become part of the air that Americans breathe.
[01:14:44.341 --> 01:14:53.188]  It goes back to Jonathan Winthrop and his sermon aboard the Arbella in 1630 in Massachusetts Bay, when they're starting the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
[01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:58.632]  He says, we shall be like a city upon a hill, that the rest of the eyes of the world will be upon us.
[01:14:58.632 --> 01:15:00.774]  We'll set the example for the world.
[01:15:00.774 --> 01:15:04.837]  Woodrow Wilson says, after the Everside Trees Conference, he says,
[01:15:05.819 --> 01:15:10.568]  Now, at last the world knows America as the savior of the world.
[01:15:10.568 --> 01:15:12.552]  This idea is so deeply ingrained.
[01:15:12.552 --> 01:15:14.456]  We see it over and over again in
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.301]  I think so.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:44.368]  We see it in Madeleine Albright, who as Secretary of State says, if we have to use force, it's because we're America.
[01:15:44.368 --> 01:15:46.249]  We're the indispensable nation.
[01:15:46.249 --> 01:15:47.831]  Hillary Clinton saying the same thing.
[01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:49.733]  We're the indispensable nation.
[01:15:49.733 --> 01:15:52.696]  We stand for peace and progress and prosperity.
[01:15:52.696 --> 01:15:56.079]  While at the same time, she's authorizing the invasion of Iraq.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:04.165]  I mean, as you know, you're going through the history, but we've had John Kerry, Secretary of State now, Obama, saying, hey, we're America.
[01:16:04.165 --> 01:16:06.206]  We've got to go in there and do this.
[01:16:06.206 --> 01:16:11.649]  When American and globalist interests started the Civil War, they put Al Qaeda in there.
[01:16:11.649 --> 01:16:12.430]  It's all on record.
[01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:22.734]  Al-Qaeda, a lot of evidence behind the chemical attacks, and then Kerry gets up and says, we're exceptional, we've got to go save the day, when it's clearly a war crime.
[01:16:22.734 --> 01:16:27.836]  I mean, I've never seen America so on the wrong side so openly.
[01:16:27.836 --> 01:16:31.417]  And again, I'm not a fan of Assad, but compared to Al-Qaeda, I am.
[01:16:31.417 --> 01:16:34.478]  I mean, it's almost a mental illness in the elite.
[01:16:34.478 --> 01:16:36.939]  Do you think they're smoking their own propaganda, their own dope?
[01:16:37.797 --> 01:16:40.179]  It's an interesting comment, because I.F.
[01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:44.682]  Stone, the great independent journalist, used to go to schools of journalism.
[01:16:44.682 --> 01:16:49.906]  He would tell the students, if you want to be a journalist, you have to remember two words.
[01:16:49.906 --> 01:16:51.527]  Governments lie.
[01:16:51.527 --> 01:16:58.412]  But he said at one point that governments lie, but the Americans smoke the same hashish they pass out.
[01:16:59.233 --> 01:17:04.176]  And it's possible that these people actually believe it, although I think Obama's too smart.
[01:17:04.176 --> 01:17:05.597]  And Kerry was once too smart.
[01:17:05.597 --> 01:17:10.040]  He was one of the founders, one of the leaders of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:16.504]  He comes from a much more thoughtful, intelligent position, and to rely on this kind of militarism.
[01:17:16.504 --> 01:17:18.805]  So these people once had some sense of
[01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:23.253]  I don't know about Hillary Clinton, if she ever had that kind of sense.
[01:17:23.253 --> 01:17:26.776]  She's so hawkish and people don't think of her as the opposite.
[01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:30.759]  Exactly, but that's what makes them such effective Judas Ghosts.
[01:17:30.759 --> 01:17:36.204]  And Obama, I've heard it said that he's not a lesser of two evils, he's a more effective of evils.
[01:17:36.204 --> 01:17:40.808]  Imagine if George W. Bush was still in office, got a magical third, fourth term.
[01:17:40.808 --> 01:17:43.330]  Could he have gotten away with anything that Obama's done?
[01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:49.374]  Well, Ari Fleischer, Bush's press secretary, said that this is Bush's fourth term.
[01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:50.535]  I agree with that.
[01:17:50.535 --> 01:17:52.296]  And in some ways, Obama is different.
[01:17:52.296 --> 01:17:57.840]  Obama did resist the attack on Syria for a long time before he came in.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.982]  Part of his problem is that he doesn't have a backbone.
[01:18:00.982 --> 01:18:05.746]  He doesn't seem to have a moral core where John F. Kennedy could stand up to the military.
[01:18:06.506 --> 01:18:07.767]  He knew what they were.
[01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:08.968]  He knew what they were doing.
[01:18:08.968 --> 01:18:11.029]  And he resisted them time after time after time.
[01:18:11.029 --> 01:18:12.750]  Well, and you saw what happened to him.
[01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.111]  Well, that's part of the message, maybe.
[01:18:14.111 --> 01:18:21.196]  You know, we don't know why Obama has turned into the opposite of what people hoped he was going to be in so many ways.
[01:18:21.896 --> 01:18:27.138]  In terms of his domestic policy, his surveillance, his overall militarism.
[01:18:27.138 --> 01:18:30.899]  And this is not the guy who deserved the Nobel Peace Prize, of course.
[01:18:30.899 --> 01:18:40.622]  This is the Obama who was lectured by Malala, that 16-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the head by the Taliban.
[01:18:40.622 --> 01:18:46.964]  She said that your drone policy is wrong, that you're killing innocent people, you're creating more enemies.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:55.291]  Sixteen-year-old girl who should have gotten the Nobel Peace Prize, perhaps, was lecturing the Nobel laureate himself.
[01:18:55.291 --> 01:19:01.419]  Has the Nobel Prize giving him to people like Henry Kissinger and now Obama made itself into a joke?
[01:19:02.202 --> 01:19:10.485]  Well, Tom Lehrer, who was a great political satirist of the 1950s and 60s, Harvard math professor, brilliant, said that he gave up.
[01:19:10.485 --> 01:19:13.726]  He stopped performing when Kissinger got the Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:19:13.726 --> 01:19:18.107]  He said, uh, political satire has become obsolete.
[01:19:18.107 --> 01:19:20.688]  Once Henry Kissinger got the Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:19:20.688 --> 01:19:22.569]  And he's right about that.
[01:19:22.569 --> 01:19:27.411]  I mean, Kissinger, of course, should be in the talk at the Hague, you know.
[01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:36.353]  This is a man whose war crimes, his long list of war crimes... Pinochet, Vietnam, the list is just endless.
[01:19:36.353 --> 01:19:42.777]  Bangladesh, Chile, Cambodia, Laos.
[01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:45.898]  One of the points that I make about Vietnam... Doctor, we've got a break.
[01:19:45.898 --> 01:19:47.019]  Come back and make that point.
[01:19:47.019 --> 01:19:53.362]  In the six minutes we have left on the other side of the break, get into other key points that you want folks to think about.
[01:19:53.362 --> 01:19:55.503]  Dr. Peter Kuznick is our guest.
[01:19:55.503 --> 01:19:56.064]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:58.487 --> 01:20:01.248]  An e-cig revolution is sweeping across the country.
[01:20:01.248 --> 01:20:03.189]  But is yours American made?
[01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:05.651]  Vapriate e-liquid by Le Cig is.

[01:20:16.756 --> 01:20:19.558]  The very principle that once drove the American economy.

[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.363]  You'll be wondering why you didn't make the change to Vapriate e-liquid by LASIG a long time ago.

[01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:28.913]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:28.913 --> 01:21:33.399]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:33.399 --> 01:21:39.146]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for retirement.
[01:21:39.146 --> 01:21:42.451]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:42.711 --> 01:21:45.373]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:45.373 --> 01:21:50.336]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:21:50.336 --> 01:21:52.577]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.577 --> 01:21:57.080]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.823]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:22:02.823 --> 01:22:10.028]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:22:10.208 --> 01:22:13.530]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:15.552]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:22:15.552 --> 01:22:20.215]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:22:20.215 --> 01:22:23.117]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:22:23.117 --> 01:22:29.081]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:22:29.081 --> 01:22:32.743]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:22:32.743 --> 01:22:37.787]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:47.156]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[01:22:56.986 --> 01:22:57.867]  My name's Bruno.
[01:22:57.867 --> 01:22:59.228]  I'm 52 years old.
[01:22:59.228 --> 01:23:02.850]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[01:23:02.850 --> 01:23:05.152]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[01:23:05.152 --> 01:23:11.097]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[01:23:11.097 --> 01:23:12.658]  My body has changed dramatically.
[01:23:13.198 --> 01:23:14.118]  I'm a cyclist.
[01:23:14.118 --> 01:23:17.139]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[01:23:17.139 --> 01:23:27.263]  After being on One World Way, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of One World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[01:23:27.263 --> 01:23:29.444]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[01:23:29.444 --> 01:23:33.645]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[01:23:33.645 --> 01:23:35.146]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:23:35.146 --> 01:23:37.187]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[01:23:37.187 --> 01:23:38.067]  Just give it a try.
[01:23:38.686 --> 01:23:41.810]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:42.170]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:43.211]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:43.211 --> 01:23:44.413]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:23:44.413 --> 01:23:45.574]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:24:08.968 --> 01:24:10.269]  This is a fitting intro.
[01:24:10.269 --> 01:24:11.629]  Dave Mustaine and Megadeth.
[01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:19.952]  A song about a dictator getting power and going stark raving power drunk crazy.
[01:24:19.952 --> 01:24:21.813]  Watch people's heads unroll.
[01:24:23.424 --> 01:24:25.926]  We've got Dr. Peter Kuznick on with us.
[01:24:25.926 --> 01:24:31.649]  I'm not going to go over his amazing bio and all the books and work he's done and the films he's made with Oliver Stone.
[01:24:31.649 --> 01:24:40.534]  We've only got about six minutes left, but you can get, by the way, I should add, the box set of Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States.
[01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:46.778]  These two collaborated on that in the filmmaking, and it's based on the book by the doctor who joins us right now.
[01:24:46.778 --> 01:24:51.901]  So, Peter, in closing, finishing up with Vietnam, then I want to ask you about the death of empires at the end.
[01:24:51.901 --> 01:24:53.062]  Finish up your Vietnam point.
[01:24:54.338 --> 01:24:58.699]  Yeah, it was very disconcerting to read recently.
[01:24:58.699 --> 01:25:11.063]  A recent Gallup poll found that 51% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 think that the Vietnam War was not a mistake.
[01:25:11.063 --> 01:25:18.445]  The older people think it was a terrible mistake, but the young kids are not even learning about Vietnam anymore, and they think it wasn't a mistake, 51%.
[01:25:18.445 --> 01:25:19.345]  Martin Luther King
[01:25:22.285 --> 01:25:29.069]  said that if America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read Vietnam.
[01:25:29.069 --> 01:25:32.231]  I think a big part of it must read Vietnam.
[01:25:32.231 --> 01:25:43.258]  And Obama has announced recently a 13-year commemoration of the Vietnam War, honoring the Americans who has fought heroically to protect the ideals we hold dear as Americans.
[01:25:43.258 --> 01:25:46.540]  Well, if you look at Vietnam, you wonder, what ideals is he talking about?
[01:25:47.228 --> 01:25:58.955]  Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense, who was the architect of that war, told my students a few years, right before his death, that he believed that 3.8 million Vietnamese died in the war.
[01:25:58.955 --> 01:26:04.678]  When I asked students how many Americans died in the war, some of them know the 58,000 number.
[01:26:04.678 --> 01:26:12.303]  When I asked them how many Vietnamese died in the war, I just did it a couple weeks ago with honor students, and the guesses raised from 300,000 to 1.3 million.
[01:26:15.481 --> 01:26:19.103]  Well, 3.8 million, according to McNamara.
[01:26:19.103 --> 01:26:22.625]  And then I asked them how many Jews died in the Holocaust.
[01:26:22.625 --> 01:26:23.366]  Every hand goes up.
[01:26:23.366 --> 01:26:25.487]  They all know the 6 million figure.
[01:26:25.487 --> 01:26:28.369]  I think that says something about American education.
[01:26:28.369 --> 01:26:34.232]  How would we feel if German kids today thought that a half million to a million Jews died in the Holocaust?
[01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:37.394]  We'd be horrified at the education system in Germany.
[01:26:37.394 --> 01:26:39.255]  But the German kids know the truth.
[01:26:39.255 --> 01:26:44.799]  The Americans have no idea about the atrocities, the outrages committed by their own government.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:57.224]  What I'd like to point out is that the Vietnam wall now, the Vietnam Memorial Wall, has the name of 58,272 Americans who died in the war.
[01:26:57.224 --> 01:27:02.065]  The message of that wall is that the tragedy of Vietnam is that 58,000 Americans died.
[01:27:02.065 --> 01:27:03.786]  That is a tragedy.
[01:27:03.786 --> 01:27:10.548]  But if that wall contained the names not only of the Americans, but also the Vietnamese, the Cambodians,
[01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:12.911]  Well it shows!
[01:27:12.911 --> 01:27:13.132]  It shows!
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.802]  I agree with you.
[01:27:34.802 --> 01:27:41.232]  So when do we really become a full-fledged empire, not just in the Americas, but all over the world?
[01:27:41.232 --> 01:27:44.016]  When does the military-industrial complex really take over?
[01:27:44.016 --> 01:27:48.082]  I'd say three years after Eisenhower left office and warned us it's when they kill Kennedy.
[01:27:48.082 --> 01:27:49.004]  Do you agree with that statement?
[01:27:49.854 --> 01:27:51.135]  Yes and no.
[01:27:51.135 --> 01:28:02.301]  We trace it back to 1898, to the Spanish-American War, when the United States starts to become a global empire, when the United States becomes a counter-revolutionary force in the Philippines.
[01:28:02.301 --> 01:28:04.822]  We, before that, supported reform and revolution.
[01:28:04.822 --> 01:28:15.128]  Then we go in there, we overthrow the Aguinaldo government, we overthrow the popular forces, we impose a dictatorship, we set up a colony there, and then we begin to intervene over it.
[01:28:15.408 --> 01:28:15.809]  Sure, Doc.
[01:28:15.809 --> 01:28:16.890]  We're almost out of time.
[01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:17.510]  I would agree with you.
[01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:22.214]  I think it is William McKinley's Navy in 1898 in the stage, Maine, clearly staged.
[01:28:22.214 --> 01:28:25.017]  Certainly used, used to supply the pitchers, all supply of the war.
[01:28:25.017 --> 01:28:28.340]  And then you've got another stage deal with the Gulf of Tonkin, 1964.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:34.205]  We've only got about... ...bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then the start of the Cold War with Truman.
[01:28:34.205 --> 01:28:39.329]  Truman wasn't in office for 10 days before he reversed Roosevelt's policies toward the Soviet Union.
[01:28:39.329 --> 01:28:40.090]  Less than 10 days.
[01:28:41.542 --> 01:28:44.023]  Amazing, just to keep the war machine going.
[01:28:44.023 --> 01:28:52.945]  In closing, the American empire, is there a way to extricate out of it without going through the evil degeneration cycle where they always become so authoritarian at home?
[01:28:52.945 --> 01:28:54.246]  Well, it's becoming authoritarian.
[01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:57.287]  Look at what's happening with the surveillance state that we see now.
[01:28:59.122 --> 01:29:00.664]  It's not easy to roll back power.
[01:29:00.664 --> 01:29:02.928]  It's not easy to roll back empires.
[01:29:02.928 --> 01:29:07.955]  But the United States still is in a position where it can learn and begin to reach out.
[01:29:07.955 --> 01:29:13.924]  On Syria we said, for example, if you want to bring in the Russians to get them to cooperate on Syria,
[01:29:14.464 --> 01:29:16.846]  Roll back on the missile defense that they hate.
[01:29:16.846 --> 01:29:19.428]  Roll back on the weaponization of space that they hate.
[01:29:19.428 --> 01:29:22.029]  Roll back on the expansion of NATO to their doorstep.
[01:29:22.029 --> 01:29:25.432]  Do you want to bring China in to collaborate with us, to cooperate with us?
[01:29:25.432 --> 01:29:34.458]  Let's pull back this Asia pivot that Obama and Clinton have announced where we're militarizing the Pacific in the same way to contain China as we tried to contain...
[01:29:35.418 --> 01:29:37.840]  That could be a way to have peace and not have World War III.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.601]  Dr. Peter Kuznick, thank you so much for your time.
[01:29:40.601 --> 01:29:41.001]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:41.001 --> 01:29:42.362]  All right, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:29:42.362 --> 01:29:42.962]  Thank you.
[01:29:42.962 --> 01:29:44.163]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[01:29:44.163 --> 01:29:44.983]  A ton of breaking news.
[01:29:44.983 --> 01:29:47.464]  Stay with us.
[01:29:47.464 --> 01:29:48.865]  We're on the march.
[01:29:48.865 --> 01:29:51.386]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:54.088]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.692 --> 01:30:05.358]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:10.502]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:10.502 --> 01:30:19.230]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:19.230 --> 01:30:23.294]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:23.294 --> 01:30:25.656]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:30:37.379 --> 01:30:39.520]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.301]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:41.301 --> 01:30:44.182]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:44.182 --> 01:30:48.425]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:30:48.425 --> 01:30:50.826]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:50.826 --> 01:30:53.507]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:53.507 --> 01:30:55.108]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:55.108 --> 01:30:55.888]  Got it.
[01:30:55.888 --> 01:30:56.749]  Others don't.
[01:30:58.772 --> 01:31:04.233]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:31:04.233 --> 01:31:13.136]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:31:13.136 --> 01:31:20.958]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:31:20.958 --> 01:31:28.340]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:32.821]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:37.002]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[01:31:37.002 --> 01:31:44.145]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.

[01:31:51.367 --> 01:31:55.408]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[01:31:58.251 --> 01:32:12.014]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, pure silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens, and parasites.
[01:32:12.014 --> 01:32:22.957]  At Silverlungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless pure nanosilver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.

[01:32:27.618 --> 01:32:36.160]  For many who are new to silver that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our 2 oz.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:44.502]  Nano-Silver Nasal Sprays, our Nano-Silver Soap, and our most popular product, the all-natural Nano-Silver Gel.

[01:32:52.343 --> 01:32:55.564]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:07.768 --> 01:33:13.851]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:33:13.851 --> 01:33:18.854]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:33:18.854 --> 01:33:23.697]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[01:33:23.697 --> 01:33:25.698]  It's not about food.
[01:33:25.698 --> 01:33:28.340]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:33:34.946 --> 01:33:37.087]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:37.087 --> 01:33:43.491]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:43.491 --> 01:33:49.694]  Well, I've got articles here where folks putting out anti-
[01:33:50.919 --> 01:33:58.881]  Corrupt Homeland Security shirts that say Homeland Stupidity are being threatened by the NSA and DHS.
[01:33:58.881 --> 01:34:00.802]  He's fighting back with a lawsuit.
[01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:03.623]  Free speech t-shirt maker threatened by NSA.
[01:34:03.623 --> 01:34:05.283]  DHS fights back with lawsuit.
[01:34:05.283 --> 01:34:09.584]  That is so criminal when parity is 100% covered.
[01:34:09.584 --> 01:34:11.885]  The NSA, the only part of government that actually listens.
[01:34:12.665 --> 01:34:15.025]  And they're trying to claim you can't use our logo.
[01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:19.846]  Government logos, folks, are the most widely open to be used items.
[01:34:19.846 --> 01:34:28.288]  They try to threaten people with criminal charges saying that you're impersonating a criminal NSA person engaging in fraud and criminal activity.
[01:34:28.288 --> 01:34:31.448]  No, we're exposing your fraud and criminal activity.
[01:34:31.448 --> 01:34:34.669]  Of your narcotics, child trafficking, murdering bosses.
[01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:36.089]  We know who you are.
[01:34:36.089 --> 01:34:41.750]  And by the way, it's that spirit of knowing who the globalists are that's going to bring them down because we call this the American empire.
[01:34:42.878 --> 01:34:47.882]  This is the globalists using America to build and fund their empire at our expense.
[01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:50.284]  That's why I want this empire to go away.
[01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:53.206]  And I don't mean just go away, like fall apart.
[01:34:53.206 --> 01:35:03.014]  I mean have our money, our tax dollars kept here to create the ingenuity and the trailblazing and the inventiveness that was American exceptionalism.
[01:35:03.014 --> 01:35:09.520]  When we did, until a hundred years ago, promote revolutions in countries for real liberty, America used to do that.
[01:35:10.202 --> 01:35:14.704]  We didn't go around meddling, but we'd support groups that were promoting freedom.
[01:35:14.704 --> 01:35:15.464]  Now it's the opposite.
[01:35:15.464 --> 01:35:24.767]  Let's put al-Qaeda in charge of Libya, Syria, and al-Qaeda-lite in charge of places like Egypt.
[01:35:24.767 --> 01:35:30.709]  And you know, you hear that professor, who's a smart guy, who comes from kind of a liberal perspective, but a real liberal perspective.
[01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:33.110]  He'll at least criticize Obama.
[01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:35.791]  We need to reach out to those people, because I'm not a conservative or a liberal.
[01:35:35.791 --> 01:35:36.851]  I'm a freedom lover.
[01:35:36.851 --> 01:35:37.832]  I'm a truth lover.
[01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:38.772]  I'm a justice lover.
[01:35:39.687 --> 01:35:43.231]  People didn't, over 150 years ago, they didn't say left or right.
[01:35:43.231 --> 01:35:45.313]  That meant male or female.
[01:35:45.313 --> 01:35:46.214]  Wicked, not wicked.
[01:35:46.214 --> 01:35:48.176]  That's sinister, non-sinister.
[01:35:48.176 --> 01:35:49.798]  Sinister means your left hand.
[01:35:49.798 --> 01:35:52.741]  Like you have a sword fight, he holds his sword sinister.
[01:35:52.741 --> 01:35:56.985]  The point is, is it was all about, is that more freedom or is that less freedom?
[01:35:56.985 --> 01:35:58.647]  Is that more fair or is that less fair?
[01:35:58.647 --> 01:36:00.589]  That's what you judge everything by, not
[01:36:03.721 --> 01:36:04.702]  It's something on the surface.
[01:36:04.702 --> 01:36:05.742]  Is that person black?
[01:36:05.742 --> 01:36:06.683]  Is that person white?
[01:36:06.683 --> 01:36:07.803]  Is that person from the South?
[01:36:07.803 --> 01:36:08.684]  Is that person from the North?
[01:36:08.684 --> 01:36:09.664]  Is that person a Christian?
[01:36:09.664 --> 01:36:10.505]  Is that person a Jew?
[01:36:10.505 --> 01:36:12.266]  Is that person an agnostic?
[01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:17.188]  You have to judge people by the character of their deeds, what they do, what they stand for.
[01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:19.429]  That's what Martin Luther King said, and I agree with that.
[01:36:19.429 --> 01:36:21.270]  Look at the so-called liberals of today.
[01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:22.451]  They're the opposite.
[01:36:22.451 --> 01:36:25.573]  A brown bag is racist, and then you comply with that.
[01:36:25.573 --> 01:36:25.973]  Well now,
[01:36:27.363 --> 01:36:30.905]  Just being a cowboy is racist.
[01:36:30.905 --> 01:36:33.266]  Wearing a cowboy hat is racist.
[01:36:33.266 --> 01:36:36.028]  Cover that red neck up even outside is racist.
[01:36:36.028 --> 01:36:37.829]  Everything becomes racist.
[01:36:37.829 --> 01:36:40.450]  It's just a war on reality.
[01:36:40.450 --> 01:36:42.871]  And they know it's asinine.
[01:36:42.871 --> 01:36:46.834]  They know it's crazy to arrest a woman that shoots her boyfriend with a water gun.
[01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:52.857]  They know it's crazy to arrest a kid in the backyard with an airsoft nerf type gun with friends.
[01:36:54.755 --> 01:36:56.215]  They say, we'll comply with the officers.
[01:36:56.215 --> 01:36:59.236]  They feel that it was threatening that you had a gun at your neighbor.
[01:36:59.236 --> 01:37:02.857]  Saw you guys shooting at a target with airsoft and it was an orange gun.
[01:37:02.857 --> 01:37:10.220]  Doesn't matter, we're going to go ahead and then the probation officer comes in and says, we're not going to charge you with menacing.
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:15.281]  But go ahead and go on probation and then you sign with the judge.
[01:37:15.281 --> 01:37:19.802]  They have just engaged in a mass fraud to violate your civil and God-given rights.
[01:37:19.802 --> 01:37:21.043]  Just like when they lie and say,
[01:37:21.994 --> 01:37:26.735]  Well, we kick you out of school for a week and then charge you with truancy because you weren't inoculated.
[01:37:26.735 --> 01:37:30.556]  We're going to drop the criminal charges of truancy if you take the shots.
[01:37:30.556 --> 01:37:32.516]  They kicked you out of school.
[01:37:32.516 --> 01:37:38.418]  The penal code in every state states that you're then not truant if they've kicked you out of the school.
[01:37:38.418 --> 01:37:40.698]  They're all in a criminal operation.
[01:37:40.698 --> 01:37:49.160]  They've got to get 97.3 percent, last time I checked, of the school inoculated or they don't get about a third of the money.
[01:37:50.472 --> 01:37:54.596]  You know, the states don't get any CPS money unless they increase.
[01:37:54.596 --> 01:37:57.138]  Last time I checked, it varies.
[01:37:57.138 --> 01:37:59.039]  Clinton got this in in 97.
[01:37:59.039 --> 01:38:02.783]  10% more kids grabbed each year.
[01:38:02.783 --> 01:38:04.624]  That's why it was a couple hundred thousand under Clinton.
[01:38:04.624 --> 01:38:07.567]  It's over a million and a half kids they grab each year now.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:09.801]  And it's only gonna grow.
[01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:11.944]  It's designed to wreck everybody.
[01:38:11.944 --> 01:38:17.551]  You can look at these actuaries, look at these setup plans, and know it's for total destruction of the family.
[01:38:17.551 --> 01:38:19.233]  But I don't even need to go look at that!
[01:38:19.233 --> 01:38:21.796]  They openly say the family's bad!
[01:38:21.796 --> 01:38:23.679]  They openly badmouth anything that's good!
[01:38:27.861 --> 01:38:33.548]  Man, I don't care if you're black, white, Hispanic, a Christian, not a Christian, whatever.
[01:38:33.548 --> 01:38:42.598]  I don't want you to be manipulated and lied to because if they can do that, they can turn you into an army of lemmings to run me and my family over.
[01:38:42.598 --> 01:38:46.102]  I want my children to grow up in a world with other good, successful people.
[01:38:46.102 --> 01:38:47.324]  I want to have a future.
[01:38:47.324 --> 01:38:48.045]  I have empathy.
[01:38:49.462 --> 01:39:01.487]  But I see the public with their death culture obsession, their zombie obsession, their murder obsession, their gangster obsession, their fake tough guy obsession, really being desensitized to everything.
[01:39:01.487 --> 01:39:05.309]  And man, I tell you, in the general public, I've never seen so much corruption.
[01:39:05.309 --> 01:39:07.450]  I've never seen so much backstabbing.
[01:39:07.450 --> 01:39:09.051]  I've never seen so much lying.
[01:39:09.051 --> 01:39:13.893]  I've never seen people do so much wrong to each other and then make excuses for it.
[01:39:15.086 --> 01:39:18.808]  I've never seen common sense so in trouble.
[01:39:18.808 --> 01:39:21.330]  And it's going to get a lot worse, folks.
[01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:22.711]  I see it in life.
[01:39:22.711 --> 01:39:23.872]  I see it in business.
[01:39:23.872 --> 01:39:25.753]  I see it in media.
[01:39:25.753 --> 01:39:33.378]  And I always realized the good feel humble and, like, pathetic if we stand up and try to lead.
[01:39:33.378 --> 01:39:37.120]  And so we just stand back and let the arrogant control freaks run things.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.982]  It's time for those of us that love justice
[01:39:39.775 --> 01:39:41.716]  To really stand up.
[01:39:41.716 --> 01:39:43.097]  Those of us that have done the research.
[01:39:43.097 --> 01:39:44.678]  Those of us that have the facts.
[01:39:44.678 --> 01:39:46.179]  Those of us that really care.
[01:39:46.179 --> 01:39:48.901]  Those of us that have common sense.
[01:39:48.901 --> 01:39:50.342]  It is our duty.
[01:39:50.342 --> 01:39:54.104]  But that duty is the animating contest of liberty that Jefferson talked about.
[01:39:54.104 --> 01:39:57.026]  It is the struggle.
[01:39:57.026 --> 01:39:58.727]  And we're taught to like give in.
[01:39:58.727 --> 01:40:00.388]  Like give, you know, compromise.
[01:40:00.388 --> 01:40:01.669]  But they never compromise.
[01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:03.530]  Compromising means we give in to them.
[01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:04.631]  They're not compromising.
[01:40:06.223 --> 01:40:15.283]  The collective, the dumbed-down mass, the low IQ, chemically dumbed-down people that will aggressively laugh at you if you try to wake them up.
[01:40:15.283 --> 01:40:15.884]  It's pathetic!
[01:40:16.826 --> 01:40:21.871]  I want to go to your phone calls in the news we haven't hit, but this is such a big deal.
[01:40:21.871 --> 01:40:34.803]  Gigi Ernetta and David Knight and others that are here today and Jakari and folks were just really freaking out this morning when they went over this article that's on DrugsReport.com.
[01:40:34.803 --> 01:40:39.127]  We have our own article up on Infowars.com, but this 2003
[01:40:41.909 --> 01:40:48.074]  Federal Communications Commission, where they basically twist arms and threaten and tell people, you've got to answer these questions.
[01:40:48.074 --> 01:40:49.515]  It's what's your political views?
[01:40:49.515 --> 01:40:50.215]  What do you do?
[01:40:50.215 --> 01:40:51.176]  How much time do you give to this?
[01:40:51.176 --> 01:40:53.017]  How much time do you give to that?
[01:40:53.017 --> 01:40:59.522]  What the Daily Caller doesn't get, and what we have in Kurt Nemo's article, I'm not saying that to differentiate myself.
[01:40:59.522 --> 01:41:00.543]  I could care less.
[01:41:00.543 --> 01:41:02.404]  I wish there were people out there that knew more than we did.
[01:41:02.404 --> 01:41:06.007]  It's pretty scary to be ragtag and be about the best there is.
[01:41:06.007 --> 01:41:07.748]  But the point is, our article breaks down.
[01:41:07.748 --> 01:41:08.929]  It is the Fairness Doctrine.
[01:41:10.063 --> 01:41:12.185]  I mean, if you know what it is, it's back.
[01:41:12.185 --> 01:41:18.190]  And Curt Nemo breaks it down in an excellent article, FCC Prepares Fairness Doctrine for the Internet.
[01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:29.820]  And if you scroll down, we have a screenshot of the document and then a link where you can go through to it, and Cass Sunstein talking about how they would use... The secret police now come and just say it's a mandatory survey.
[01:41:32.435 --> 01:41:40.457]  Just like they have police on the highways under federal funds who take blood and stuff, but they say, oh, it's a research project, you don't have to, but you better.
[01:41:40.457 --> 01:41:46.678]  And then the feds, then after they do that for a while, then they fund blood draws and lie and say, oh, it's a real warrant, when it's not.
[01:41:46.678 --> 01:41:49.479]  They want in your body, folks, they want to put their hands on you.
[01:41:49.479 --> 01:41:52.499]  Nothing to do with drinking beer, okay?
[01:41:52.499 --> 01:41:57.060]  And now they are going to go through and say, what is the news philosophy of the station?
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:59.261]  Who else in your market provides news?
[01:42:00.472 --> 01:42:02.714]  Who are your main competitors?
[01:42:02.714 --> 01:42:06.818]  How much news does your station air every day?
[01:42:06.818 --> 01:42:08.440]  And again, I get these.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.144]  I got these under the business census this year.
[01:42:12.144 --> 01:42:13.385]  You're like, but it's 2013.
[01:42:13.385 --> 01:42:16.688]  You're not people, the ignorant public goes, you only get it every 10 years.
[01:42:16.688 --> 01:42:17.309]  I, no, no, no.
[01:42:17.309 --> 01:42:23.255]  I get threatened by the Department of Labor when that's not even the group over the census.
[01:42:25.458 --> 01:42:29.400]  With arrest, folks, if I don't tell them stuff I don't even know.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.841]  What's the total profit on this?
[01:42:30.841 --> 01:42:31.841]  What'd you do on that?
[01:42:31.841 --> 01:42:33.542]  What have you amortized?
[01:42:33.542 --> 01:42:36.464]  I mean, it would be $50,000 a year of accounting.
[01:42:36.464 --> 01:42:38.985]  We had the accountant look at it to answer those questions properly.
[01:42:38.985 --> 01:42:42.407]  And if I didn't answer them properly, I would be lying on a federal document.
[01:42:42.407 --> 01:42:43.268]  Then they would have me.
[01:42:44.048 --> 01:42:45.569]  I can't fill this thing out.
[01:42:45.569 --> 01:42:49.592]  I don't even mess with my own life.
[01:42:49.592 --> 01:42:53.795]  I'm not sitting here counting coins or something.
[01:42:53.795 --> 01:42:56.177]  I'm busy trying to cover the news.
[01:42:56.177 --> 01:42:59.999]  And then they lie on the forum and say it's the law.
[01:42:59.999 --> 01:43:01.521]  We will fine you or arrest you.
[01:43:01.521 --> 01:43:02.461]  And I know the law.
[01:43:02.461 --> 01:43:03.882]  I know the federal rulings.
[01:43:03.882 --> 01:43:05.223]  I know what the census is.
[01:43:05.223 --> 01:43:07.645]  The census isn't, do you own firearms?
[01:43:07.645 --> 01:43:08.926]  Do you have a low flush toilet?
[01:43:10.066 --> 01:43:12.487]  How many of your employees are minority?
[01:43:12.487 --> 01:43:16.668]  It's all just stuff to put in a database for targeting.
[01:43:16.668 --> 01:43:17.908]  Who are your board of directors?
[01:43:17.908 --> 01:43:21.269]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:21.269 --> 01:43:22.309]  There is no board of directors.
[01:43:22.309 --> 01:43:23.330]  It's me.
[01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:27.551]  But it just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:43:27.551 --> 01:43:27.911]  And now...
[01:43:29.062 --> 01:43:32.143]  How much does community input influence news coverage decisions?
[01:43:32.143 --> 01:43:39.264]  This is to get you to report and where they can admit and say, you don't follow the new fairness doctrine we've put in.
[01:43:39.264 --> 01:43:41.285]  They admit that, by the way.
[01:43:41.285 --> 01:43:45.826]  You have at least 10 Democratic senators saying this, saying they want to shut us down and shut us up.
[01:43:45.826 --> 01:43:51.927]  In fact, I want a directive, and I've been saying this the last few months, AP admitted two weeks ago there was a war on the press.
[01:43:51.927 --> 01:43:58.209]  I want every night on the nightly news, not just when I host it, I want the war on the press and the war on media out there.
[01:43:59.167 --> 01:44:16.393]  It's like Pig Stein, uh, Dianne Feinstein, uh, Scum Stein, Witch Stein, whatever her name is, up there with the Bodyguard Stein, who doesn't want you to be able to be armed, saying that they will license a bill to protect the press does the opposite, like Affordable Care Act makes it unaffordable.
[01:44:16.393 --> 01:44:18.834]  And if this is free, baby, I don't want it.
[01:44:18.834 --> 01:44:20.154]  Okay?
[01:44:20.154 --> 01:44:25.256]  Affordable Care Act, 539% increase for Humana folks in Texas.
[01:44:25.256 --> 01:44:27.497]  Infowars.com yesterday, Mike Adams' article.
[01:44:28.756 --> 01:44:34.921]  This is the type of issue that we're dealing with here.
[01:44:34.921 --> 01:44:36.602]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:44:36.602 --> 01:44:40.686]  They get you, and I want to have this added to the articles, this is 100% clear.
[01:44:40.686 --> 01:44:43.067]  I know Kurt has got most of the angles covered in this.
[01:44:43.067 --> 01:44:49.652]  Like the 2010 Inforce reported on an effort by a coalition of more than 30 liberal organizations to shut down the First Amendment right of political enemies.
[01:44:49.652 --> 01:44:51.454]  And they're doing the same thing in Europe, folks.
[01:44:51.454 --> 01:44:52.535]  These are the enemy.
[01:44:53.649 --> 01:44:54.870]  And so they're trying to hide it in plain view.
[01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:56.912]  Your kids don't belong to you, they belong to the state.
[01:44:56.912 --> 01:44:59.834]  MSNBC promo.
[01:44:59.834 --> 01:45:02.896]  Don't go out as a cowboy, that hurts the cowboys.
[01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:06.119]  And don't go out as a Native American, that's racist and insensitive.
[01:45:06.119 --> 01:45:09.921]  And don't be a geisha, girl.
[01:45:09.921 --> 01:45:11.523]  Don't be an artist, don't have fun.
[01:45:13.137 --> 01:45:14.658]  Next, don't dress up like Spider-Man.
[01:45:14.658 --> 01:45:15.799]  It's racist against spiders.
[01:45:15.799 --> 01:45:16.800]  I mean, what the?
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.521]  Don't put green paint on your skin.
[01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:20.382]  It's racist against the Hulk.
[01:45:20.382 --> 01:45:22.364]  It's just getting you all like where you can't even talk.
[01:45:22.364 --> 01:45:24.105]  You go, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:45:24.105 --> 01:45:25.546]  They're like, that's OK.
[01:45:25.546 --> 01:45:27.167]  Do what we say and you'll be all right.
[01:45:27.167 --> 01:45:27.648]  They came in.
[01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:33.653]  To doctors, I know, including my dad, and big dental management companies, medical management companies, you name it.
[01:45:33.653 --> 01:45:49.823]  We had Dr. Blaylock on about this, and they come in and they go, well, you saw how we've been arresting all these directors of clinics and stuff for not literally dotting an I or crossing a T on a computer screen, or sending in files to the government that are overlaid in a computer spreadsheet because some secretary did something wrong.
[01:45:49.823 --> 01:45:52.765]  And we, you know, seizing whole things, shutting everything down.
[01:45:52.765 --> 01:45:53.345]  Just don't worry.
[01:45:53.345 --> 01:45:56.207]  Play ball and do what we say, and then you can do whatever you want.
[01:45:57.645 --> 01:46:00.028]  And then my dad's like, how about I just retire early?
[01:46:00.028 --> 01:46:01.250]  I just, whoa.
[01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:03.693]  Hey, we ought to look at some countries to move to, son.
[01:46:03.693 --> 01:46:05.776]  You know, I mean, that's what this, but see, that's their plan.
[01:46:05.776 --> 01:46:08.900]  They want to run everybody out of it.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:12.084]  Let me tell you, these bureaucrats come around, folks, a lot of them, they look you right in the eye.
[01:46:12.904 --> 01:46:16.226]  My dad, when I was a kid, the IRS called him and he said, I have all my receipts.
[01:46:16.226 --> 01:46:16.826]  I've paid all this.
[01:46:16.826 --> 01:46:18.867]  I don't owe you all this back tax stuff.
[01:46:18.867 --> 01:46:22.549]  And the woman said, Mr. Jones, we are white collar criminals.
[01:46:22.549 --> 01:46:24.469]  This is before people would record stuff.
[01:46:24.469 --> 01:46:25.630]  My dad said, I love America.
[01:46:25.630 --> 01:46:26.430]  There's no way you just said that.
[01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:29.212]  She said, look, we're going to destroy you and your family.
[01:46:29.212 --> 01:46:31.073]  I am a criminal.
[01:46:31.073 --> 01:46:34.574]  And my dad came home and I remember was freaked out for weeks.
[01:46:34.574 --> 01:46:35.835]  And my dad never gets depressed.
[01:46:36.923 --> 01:46:38.724]  My dad was shook up bad.
[01:46:38.724 --> 01:46:40.284]  And then they started taking his bank accounts, everything.
[01:46:40.284 --> 01:46:41.585]  He fought them for years.
[01:46:41.585 --> 01:46:43.986]  These are gang raping criminals.
[01:46:43.986 --> 01:46:45.927]  They want to hurt you.
[01:46:45.927 --> 01:46:52.069]  They're bank robbers in huge swarm clusters like locusts coming in on us.
[01:46:52.069 --> 01:46:53.690]  They're not gonna stop.
[01:46:53.690 --> 01:46:55.050]  They're never gonna stop.
[01:46:55.050 --> 01:46:57.091]  They're arming their teeth against us.
[01:46:57.091 --> 01:46:59.472]  They're telling troops they can't be Christians.
[01:46:59.472 --> 01:47:04.234]  These people are Joe Stalin on PCP, okay?
[01:47:04.234 --> 01:47:05.595]  And they're pedophiles, okay?
[01:47:06.837 --> 01:47:07.999]  That's the main brigade.
[01:47:07.999 --> 01:47:12.967]  The most common type in them is a child rapist, I'm telling you.
[01:47:12.967 --> 01:47:16.232]  And they're coming down on us hard, and they're not going to back down.
[01:47:16.232 --> 01:47:17.514]  So just fight them.
[01:47:17.514 --> 01:47:20.398]  And identifying them as the enemy, they've already announced us as the enemy.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:22.981]  They've announced George Washington as the enemy.
[01:47:22.981 --> 01:47:27.303]  These people are the scum of the earth, the most dishonorable jellyfish filth.
[01:47:27.303 --> 01:47:32.306]  But they have the revel, the power, they revel in their masses of weakness.
[01:47:32.306 --> 01:47:34.347]  They revel in their armaments against us.
[01:47:34.347 --> 01:47:36.068]  They revel in their red carpets.
[01:47:36.068 --> 01:47:37.849]  They revel in their Air Force Ones.
[01:47:37.849 --> 01:47:38.530]  They revel!
[01:47:39.537 --> 01:47:41.598]  Telling parents they can't pack their kids' lunches.
[01:47:41.598 --> 01:47:45.080]  They revel in arresting vets cleaning their gun in their garage.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:47.062]  They revel in persecuting us!
[01:47:47.062 --> 01:47:48.222]  They hate us!
[01:47:48.222 --> 01:47:49.863]  Because we are the light!
[01:47:49.863 --> 01:47:51.144]  And they don't want to see it!
[01:47:51.144 --> 01:47:55.467]  They want to crawl around like Gollum under the mountain, folks!
[01:47:55.467 --> 01:47:56.928]  And they're not going to leave us alone!
[01:47:56.928 --> 01:47:57.948]  Do you understand that?
[01:47:57.948 --> 01:47:59.329]  They are the enemy!
[01:47:59.329 --> 01:48:00.270]  The enemy!
[01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:03.091]  The enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy!
[01:48:03.091 --> 01:48:04.012]  The enemy!
[01:48:04.012 --> 01:48:05.853]  The sworn enemy of everything good!
[01:48:05.853 --> 01:48:07.214]  They are demonic!
[01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:08.495]  They are the hordes of hell!
[01:48:09.451 --> 01:48:13.053]  They are absolute anathema to everything good.
[01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:14.233]  They are the plague.
[01:48:14.233 --> 01:48:15.414]  They are the scourge.
[01:48:15.414 --> 01:48:16.514]  They are the traitor.
[01:48:16.514 --> 01:48:18.935]  They are the destroyer of ideas.
[01:48:18.935 --> 01:48:20.636]  They are the opposite of liberals.
[01:48:20.636 --> 01:48:26.278]  They are absolute pit of hell, child molesting murderers!
[01:48:26.278 --> 01:48:29.680]  You sign on with these people, you've signed on to absolute hell.
[01:48:34.943 --> 01:48:36.304]  And they're really going to try it.
[01:48:36.304 --> 01:48:40.547]  And believe me, I just want them to know they strike me down, set me up, whatever.
[01:48:40.547 --> 01:48:45.170]  I've already won not being a pile of garbage, traitorous filth like you.
[01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:45.970]  Don't you get it?
[01:48:45.970 --> 01:48:48.712]  I'm not worried about what you do to my body.
[01:48:48.712 --> 01:48:52.515]  Even if there isn't a God or a life after this, my family goes on.
[01:48:52.515 --> 01:48:56.718]  All that matters is that you be beaten so that people in the future can have a chance.
[01:48:57.358 --> 01:49:00.102]  To enjoy God's creation and to build something better.
[01:49:00.102 --> 01:49:09.394]  That's what life's all about, is stretching forward like all our ancestors did, to try to get finger holds into a future of honor and goodness.
[01:49:09.394 --> 01:49:13.058]  The public has been psych-warfared with demonic evil.
[01:49:13.058 --> 01:49:15.241]  The sitcoms, the dramas, all the...
[01:49:16.252 --> 01:49:20.194]  Businesses cheating each other, cheating sex, all this other stuff.
[01:49:20.194 --> 01:49:22.555]  It's all meant to just fry everyone.
[01:49:22.555 --> 01:49:28.277]  And everyone engaged in evil thinks they've learned some secret technology of betrayal and they're smart and you're not.
[01:49:28.277 --> 01:49:33.059]  And they deploy lies on you like it's a game and they're winning.
[01:49:33.059 --> 01:49:35.720]  They don't know they're losing by being frauds.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:38.081]  They don't know they're losing by being scammers.
[01:49:38.081 --> 01:49:40.502]  They don't know they're losing everything.
[01:49:40.502 --> 01:49:40.882]  Everything.
[01:49:40.882 --> 01:49:41.923]  They're dishonorable.
[01:49:42.731 --> 01:49:46.575]  And it is our responsibility to crush them politically.
[01:49:46.575 --> 01:49:51.900]  It is our responsibility to disdain them and to call them out for the pieces of trash they are.
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:54.642]  And do the opposite of everything they say.
[01:49:54.642 --> 01:49:55.903]  You wanna know a battle plan?
[01:49:55.903 --> 01:49:57.185]  Do the opposite of everything they say.
[01:49:58.345 --> 01:50:00.926]  If they're promoting something, it's the kiss of death.
[01:50:00.926 --> 01:50:01.967]  You got that?
[01:50:01.967 --> 01:50:04.048]  Anything they push is failure.
[01:50:04.048 --> 01:50:06.369]  Everything they push is meant to screw you up.
[01:50:06.369 --> 01:50:10.412]  Everything they promote is meant to poison you physically, mentally, spiritually.
[01:50:10.412 --> 01:50:14.054]  Everything, everything they are is the enemy of everything good.
[01:50:14.054 --> 01:50:15.414]  You're like, but why?
[01:50:15.414 --> 01:50:15.835]  Why?
[01:50:15.835 --> 01:50:17.295]  Why?
[01:50:17.295 --> 01:50:20.417]  You don't have a wicked soul at its core.
[01:50:20.417 --> 01:50:21.138]  You are wicked.
[01:50:21.138 --> 01:50:25.080]  I'm wicked as well, but we... I've said I got an evil streak a trillion miles wide.
[01:50:26.129 --> 01:50:30.193]  I've got a streak of good as big as infinity, folks.
[01:50:30.193 --> 01:50:36.839]  So you know that evil streak's a trillion miles wide, and it's lovely dark and deep for the evil eye.
[01:50:36.839 --> 01:50:49.532]  When you've seen the universe and infinity, or even glimpsed it, the edge of it, just the beginnings of it, the sound of running water and giggling children and happiness on forever,
[01:50:51.098 --> 01:50:53.879]  Honor stacked upon beauty, upon goodness.
[01:50:53.879 --> 01:50:56.240]  You look at the evil and it is a joke.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.460]  A shriveled joke.
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:02.101]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[01:51:02.101 --> 01:51:05.923]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[01:51:05.923 --> 01:51:12.105]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[01:51:12.105 --> 01:51:19.507]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system.
[01:51:19.667 --> 01:51:22.308]  Which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:26.990]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terraganix.

[01:52:57.569 --> 01:53:03.332]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:53:03.332 --> 01:53:10.715]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:53:10.715 --> 01:53:13.876]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:53:14.036 --> 01:53:16.057]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:53:16.057 --> 01:53:20.718]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:53:20.718 --> 01:53:23.619]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:53:23.619 --> 01:53:29.581]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.

[01:54:17.398 --> 01:54:20.140]  Sheriff John Brown came.
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:26.743]  I saw Sheriff John Brown came in to shoot me down.
[01:54:26.743 --> 01:54:30.205]  So I shot, I shot, I shot.
[01:54:30.205 --> 01:54:33.267]  And defending yourself is called terrorism.
[01:54:33.267 --> 01:54:34.487]  We're back live, folks.
[01:54:43.191 --> 01:54:51.558]  By the way, Sibelius, as you know, fell on her sword earlier today.
[01:54:51.558 --> 01:54:54.540]  Like others have been scurrying off, like the head of Homeland Security and others.
[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:56.261]  They're just there to get their payday and leave.
[01:54:56.261 --> 01:54:57.983]  She said Obamacare is all her fault.
[01:54:57.983 --> 01:54:59.244]  It's not the insurance companies.
[01:54:59.244 --> 01:55:00.325]  It's not Obama.
[01:55:00.325 --> 01:55:01.806]  It's not the foreign banks.
[01:55:01.806 --> 01:55:02.867]  It's all her fault.
[01:55:02.867 --> 01:55:06.029]  And so they want to make it all about the website not working.
[01:55:06.029 --> 01:55:08.191]  Your premiums are going up in some areas almost 600%.
[01:55:08.191 --> 01:55:08.471]  539 in Texas.
[01:55:13.287 --> 01:55:14.448]  That's not a mistake.
[01:55:14.448 --> 01:55:19.529]  That's a precision operation against people that the elite have no respect for.
[01:55:19.529 --> 01:55:22.110]  They think you're idiots because you act like idiots.
[01:55:22.110 --> 01:55:23.851]  I'm talking to supporters of the system.
[01:55:23.851 --> 01:55:27.712]  You think you're a winner because you cozy up against the biggest dragon you can find.
[01:55:29.121 --> 01:55:38.031]  You're like a sheep coming up to the big pack of wolves, and you think if you come up to them and curl up next to them, that the starving, ravenous wolves are gonna give you kissy time.
[01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:40.414]  They're not gonna give you kissy time!
[01:55:40.414 --> 01:55:43.397]  And you can sit there and watch sheep being torn apart in front of you.
[01:55:43.397 --> 01:55:45.940]  Wolves sometimes will just kill like 10, 15 sheep for fun.
[01:55:46.661 --> 01:55:51.303]  Just, you know, and they're just running around, ripping their guts out, running with their intestines 20 feet, literally.
[01:55:51.303 --> 01:55:54.184]  You can look at films of it online.
[01:55:54.184 --> 01:55:57.305]  And other sheep will just roll over and go, ugh.
[01:55:57.305 --> 01:55:59.666]  That's why you call cowards that won't resist sheep.
[01:56:01.203 --> 01:56:06.005]  Because they roll over and go, oh, and just, you know, help me.
[01:56:06.005 --> 01:56:07.686]  And that's people think they do that.
[01:56:07.686 --> 01:56:08.566]  They go, oh, no.
[01:56:08.566 --> 01:56:14.368]  Historically, big giant governments in black uniforms saying that they'll arrest Christians and that the family isn't good.
[01:56:14.368 --> 01:56:16.649]  That's not Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[01:56:16.649 --> 01:56:18.510]  No, no, no, no.
[01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:20.551]  That's liberal trendy.
[01:56:20.551 --> 01:56:22.512]  I mean, it's pathetic.
[01:56:22.512 --> 01:56:23.252]  Pathetic.
[01:56:24.349 --> 01:56:29.112]  And I'm starting to flip out because it gets crazier every day as these people think they're in total control.
[01:56:29.112 --> 01:56:31.694]  They just run around admitting all their crimes.
[01:56:31.694 --> 01:56:35.697]  And then people go, well, is it wrong you can't pack your kids lunch?
[01:56:35.697 --> 01:56:36.917]  I mean, is it wrong?
[01:56:36.917 --> 01:56:40.540]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:44.843]  Any justification people can do for the system.
[01:56:44.843 --> 01:56:46.404]  This is not what made this country great.
[01:56:47.819 --> 01:56:48.799]  Okay.
[01:56:48.799 --> 01:56:53.200]  America has had exceptionalism compared to all the other places.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.401]  Undoubtedly.
[01:56:54.401 --> 01:56:57.422]  Did stuff like beat the biggest empire in the world I've ever seen that nobody had beaten.
[01:56:57.422 --> 01:57:01.883]  I mean Britain beat Napoleon a few years ago.
[01:57:01.883 --> 01:57:05.424]  A few years after we beat them.
[01:57:05.424 --> 01:57:06.144]  After we beat the British.
[01:57:07.361 --> 01:57:11.083]  And again, folks, it's because we had right on our side and we didn't back off.
[01:57:11.083 --> 01:57:16.387]  And that's why you gotta learn to just know that they're the enemy, commit and not care what they say.
[01:57:16.387 --> 01:57:19.468]  Just discredit them, savage them, and be confident.
[01:57:19.468 --> 01:57:21.850]  Because the sheep are looking for confidence, folks.
[01:57:21.850 --> 01:57:23.531]  They see confidence in the wolves.
[01:57:23.531 --> 01:57:26.573]  They don't have confidence in themselves that they could run from the wolves.
[01:57:26.573 --> 01:57:28.694]  And so they just roll over, spread their legs.
[01:57:28.694 --> 01:57:29.635]  That's what sheep do.
[01:57:29.635 --> 01:57:35.038]  They see a wolf, they just roll over, open their legs and think, if I let you rip my guts out, you'll eat me slower.
[01:57:37.045 --> 01:57:39.366]  Because they want to be eaten slower, I mean, for whatever reason.
[01:57:39.366 --> 01:57:41.827]  I don't understand it.
[01:57:41.827 --> 01:57:43.628]  That's why a lot of folks call themselves a sheepdog.
[01:57:43.628 --> 01:57:46.109]  You're not a wolf, you're not a sheep.
[01:57:46.109 --> 01:57:51.371]  And the sheepdog, you've seen footage, you can look them up online, of sheepdogs tearing into wolves.
[01:57:51.371 --> 01:57:54.213]  And see, we're supposed to be sheepdogs, folks, not sheep.
[01:57:54.213 --> 01:57:56.293]  And we're not supposed to raise a nation of sheep.
[01:57:56.293 --> 01:57:58.934]  Everything they do is to raise a nation of sheep.
[01:57:58.934 --> 01:58:01.195]  We're going to go into overdrive and take a few calls here.
[01:58:01.195 --> 01:58:02.576]  Watson just sent me breaking news.
[01:58:02.576 --> 01:58:04.517]  We have the video, but YouTube's down right now.
[01:58:05.922 --> 01:58:07.863]  This is bombshell breaking news.
[01:58:07.863 --> 01:58:15.346]  Riot Control DHS spends $500,000 on fully automatic pepper spray launchers.
[01:58:15.346 --> 01:58:17.686]  I mean, they are just buying every weapon.
[01:58:17.686 --> 01:58:21.668]  Soft kill, less lethal, lethal, non-lethal.
[01:58:22.268 --> 01:58:30.117]  And this ties into the billions of bullets, the armored vehicles, and they purchased 240,000 pepper spray projectiles, 100 pepper spray launchers.
[01:58:30.117 --> 01:58:31.178]  This is just in one area.
[01:58:31.178 --> 01:58:36.965]  They're spending hundreds of millions per state preparing for total collapse of society because they love you.
[01:58:36.965 --> 01:58:38.546]  Obamacare was meant to do all this.
[01:58:39.207 --> 01:58:43.132]  It is a direct hit on our main engine, and we're on fire, blowing out.
[01:58:43.132 --> 01:58:45.094]  They're going, oh, it's an accident.
[01:58:45.094 --> 01:58:48.078]  Oh, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[01:58:48.078 --> 01:58:52.383]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[01:58:52.383 --> 01:58:55.127]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere.
[01:58:55.427 --> 01:58:58.249]  And the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[01:58:58.249 --> 01:59:04.054]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[01:59:04.054 --> 01:59:07.997]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.
[01:59:07.997 --> 01:59:15.182]  Supernatural Silver offers a safe and effective means of fighting pathogens, and can help defeat the root of these problems.

[01:59:49.011 --> 01:59:50.551]  Coast to coast.
[01:59:50.551 --> 01:59:52.592]  Direct from Austin.
[01:59:52.592 --> 02:00:00.713]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:00:00.713 --> 02:00:02.014]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.014 --> 02:00:03.794]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:03.794 --> 02:00:04.954]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:04.954 --> 02:00:06.415]  You want answers?
[02:00:06.415 --> 02:00:08.675]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:08.675 --> 02:00:12.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.876 --> 02:00:16.957]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.378 --> 02:00:41.744]  Coming up, the FCC's announced they're sending out Stasi forces in these surveys they're doing that they force companies to do outside law but with threats to answer questions about their politics.
[02:00:41.744 --> 02:00:45.866]  And see, that's what they said 15 years ago that the census was then going to be.
[02:00:45.866 --> 02:00:48.067]  Back in like 1998, they were already preparing the 2000 census.
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:52.982]  And they admitted that this is how the Stasi will come.
[02:00:52.982 --> 02:00:55.644]  Oh, it's a survey.
[02:00:55.644 --> 02:00:57.585]  Notice that's how thieves knock on your door, too.
[02:00:57.585 --> 02:00:58.906]  Oh, we're selling newspapers.
[02:00:58.906 --> 02:01:00.167]  We're selling magazines.
[02:01:00.167 --> 02:01:01.408]  Oh, we've got a good deal for you.
[02:01:01.408 --> 02:01:03.349]  We're selling speaker systems.
[02:01:03.349 --> 02:01:06.391]  And sometimes it's just a scam to get you to sign up for a fake subscription.
[02:01:06.391 --> 02:01:10.314]  Sometimes they shove a gun in your face and come in and, well, tie you up and kill you.
[02:01:10.314 --> 02:01:14.457]  And, you know, even though it creates a murder investigation, a lot of times they just like to kill you.
[02:01:14.457 --> 02:01:15.658]  And the globalists are like that, too.
[02:01:15.658 --> 02:01:16.819]  I mean, it's a big thrill for them.
[02:01:17.581 --> 02:01:23.393]  And no one's run them to ground, no one's stood up to them, so they're in a big, giant, spoiled, rotten operation.
[02:01:23.393 --> 02:01:24.034]  Like kids.
[02:01:24.034 --> 02:01:28.182]  If you had bad kids and let them do whatever they wanted, pretty soon they'd probably be killing people.
[02:01:28.865 --> 02:01:32.227]  It's kind of like if you've got enough employees, a lot of them are good, a lot of them are bad.
[02:01:32.227 --> 02:01:35.609]  You don't monitor people, you don't see what they're doing, you don't give them goals.
[02:01:35.609 --> 02:01:43.355]  They will literally every time shut up and then tell you that they are your boss and make up some reason that they're your boss and you're a bad person.
[02:01:43.355 --> 02:01:44.796]  And the globalists also do that.
[02:01:44.796 --> 02:01:48.438]  They always demonize, it's just human nature, corrupt human nature.
[02:01:48.438 --> 02:01:54.262]  They always demonize whoever they're abusing or whoever they're dominating so that it's okay for them to feel like they're doing that.
[02:01:54.262 --> 02:01:58.345]  Well, I declare my resistance to all control freaks and scum.
[02:01:59.186 --> 02:02:00.207]  I see you.
[02:02:00.207 --> 02:02:02.591]  You are pathetic and you will be defeated.
[02:02:02.591 --> 02:02:06.838]  Let's go to Zach in New Hampshire, ahead of Max Keiser joining us.
[02:02:06.838 --> 02:02:07.720]  Zach, you're on the air.
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:08.200]  Welcome, sir.
[02:02:09.195 --> 02:02:11.838]  Hey Alex, I'd just like to say I'm a big fan of your show.
[02:02:11.838 --> 02:02:13.259]  Thank you so much for everything you do.
[02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:16.923]  You're really doing God's work and you really help to wake up me and my family.
[02:02:16.923 --> 02:02:20.146]  I'd just like to run a few things by you and see what you think about them.
[02:02:20.146 --> 02:02:26.632]  But, um, I do a lot of research on, like, the paranormal and I've had paranormal experiences and, you know, seen UFOs and photographed things.
[02:02:26.632 --> 02:02:30.035]  And the research I've done is it's all occultic and it's all demonic.
[02:02:30.035 --> 02:02:31.417]  I'd just like to know what you think about that.
[02:02:32.028 --> 02:02:43.692]  Well, look, just from a scientific perspective, the elite throughout history, and especially in modern times, you'd think it would be less, are obsessed with the occult and believe they're deriving their power from the occult.
[02:02:43.692 --> 02:02:57.936]  I mean, both George Bush, his dad, so many others like John Kerry believe that they are possessed by dark angels and that that's where they get their power at skull and bones.
[02:02:57.936 --> 02:03:00.257]  I mean, their own documents have been leaked.
[02:03:00.257 --> 02:03:01.257]  That's mainstream news.
[02:03:02.284 --> 02:03:09.106]  Back in the 80s it got leaked by Charlotte Iserby, whose father and I guess grandfather were in it.
[02:03:09.106 --> 02:03:16.407]  But more has been leaked and it's now been ABC News has confirmed these are people who believe they are channeling entities.
[02:03:16.407 --> 02:03:20.608]  So regardless whether, because atheists will say I don't believe in any of that and say I'm a kook.
[02:03:20.608 --> 02:03:23.849]  Well it'd be like if I said pygmies worship the snake god or whatever.
[02:03:23.849 --> 02:03:27.830]  I don't worship the snake god, I'm reporting on the anthropology, the sociology,
[02:03:28.770 --> 02:03:34.352]  Of those people, the globalists worship blood, death, and hurting children.
[02:03:34.352 --> 02:03:36.512]  And that's their most popular cult.
[02:03:36.512 --> 02:03:37.452]  They've got some other cults.
[02:03:37.452 --> 02:03:41.873]  I mean, you can get in the cult if you'll just go along with them and stuff.
[02:03:41.873 --> 02:03:47.235]  But you don't get to the higher levels unless you like to torture children to death.
[02:03:47.235 --> 02:03:47.515]  Go ahead.
[02:03:48.749 --> 02:04:01.093]  So you'd agree that like things like ghosts and aliens and UFOs and even like Bigfoot, like it's all occultic and like... Well, no, you know, I mean a lot of Bigfoot is guys dressing up in gorilla outfits so they can sell a film for, you know, $50,000.
[02:04:01.093 --> 02:04:06.295]  That's a guy in a gorilla suit.
[02:04:06.295 --> 02:04:10.116]  Have there been groups of wild humans throughout history broken away from other folks?
[02:04:10.116 --> 02:04:11.156]  Wild men, yeah.
[02:04:11.156 --> 02:04:12.757]  I mean on the hike and bike trail in Austin,
[02:04:13.885 --> 02:04:17.727]  They got pushed out by the police into deeper areas, but I've hiked before.
[02:04:17.727 --> 02:04:19.547]  I've got to admit it, because they don't enforce it.
[02:04:19.547 --> 02:04:24.910]  There was a big piece of private property, about 200 acres, right over by my house in South Austin.
[02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:26.010]  I lived over there.
[02:04:26.010 --> 02:04:29.152]  And I would go out there with my wife before I had kids.
[02:04:29.152 --> 02:04:30.712]  She was first pregnant.
[02:04:30.712 --> 02:04:36.215]  And I'd always heard in that area of South Austin, there was the wild man, literally wearing skins of animals on him.
[02:04:37.356 --> 02:04:42.240]  He looked like a wild Davy Crockett or a cross between Davy Crockett and the Unabomber.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:46.563]  And I was walking down a forest path and looked up and here he was 15 feet in front of me.
[02:04:46.563 --> 02:04:51.927]  About a six foot four guy wearing furs, totally skinny, a wild man with dirt on his face.
[02:04:51.927 --> 02:04:54.910]  And he bared his teeth at me and then ran away so fast.
[02:04:56.343 --> 02:04:59.345]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.

[02:05:05.710 --> 02:05:12.095]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:05:12.515 --> 02:05:14.797]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:05:14.797 --> 02:05:16.138]  They're the good guys.

[02:05:55.714 --> 02:06:04.498]  Financial experts are certain that within 12 to 36 months, the American economy will collapse, pushing most Americans into terrifying poverty, like third world slums.

[02:08:00.785 --> 02:08:02.106]  Big Brother.
[02:08:02.106 --> 02:08:03.868]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:03.868 --> 02:08:05.630]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:05.630 --> 02:08:07.211]  You want answers?
[02:08:07.211 --> 02:08:08.753]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:08.753 --> 02:08:12.957]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.957 --> 02:08:17.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.447 --> 02:08:38.432]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two.
[02:08:38.432 --> 02:08:40.293]  And there's an article out by the Daily Caller.
[02:08:40.293 --> 02:08:43.156]  It's up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:08:43.156 --> 02:08:50.562]  FCC to police, news media, question reporters in wide-ranging content survey.
[02:08:50.562 --> 02:08:52.664]  And this is how they send out the secret police now.
[02:08:52.664 --> 02:08:58.830]  You've got at least 10 Democratic senators calling for a return to the Fairness Doctrine, where you cannot give any of your views.
[02:08:58.830 --> 02:08:59.510]  You can't say
[02:09:00.251 --> 02:09:04.172]  I think it's illegal that the NSA is spying on us without warrants.
[02:09:04.172 --> 02:09:11.655]  You have to just report what the government said, that it's loving, and that it's, you know, like Dianne Feinstein says, it's not surveillance to be illegally spied on.
[02:09:11.655 --> 02:09:13.336]  That's a quote.
[02:09:13.336 --> 02:09:22.919]  That it's not surveillance, that it's a wonderful thing that they're doing for you, and that you should be just absolutely, amazingly thankful.
[02:09:23.891 --> 02:09:26.172]  Well, now they say that's not allowed.
[02:09:26.172 --> 02:09:41.061]  And I actually went into the 2013 report here, and the really meaty stuff starts on page 20, 23, and they're going to make sure that you're being politically correct and putting you in a database.
[02:09:41.061 --> 02:09:47.785]  And so this creates the database and a survey of everyone's political views and what you're saying and what you're doing.
[02:09:47.785 --> 02:09:50.607]  And then they come around now with the different federal departments to businesses
[02:09:51.567 --> 02:09:54.089]  They send us these things every few months now.
[02:09:54.089 --> 02:09:57.931]  The general public goes, well, I don't get those because you're not what they call a business.
[02:09:57.931 --> 02:10:01.814]  They send me these things saying, you know, who are your corporate directors?
[02:10:01.814 --> 02:10:02.774]  How much money do you make?
[02:10:02.774 --> 02:10:03.895]  What's the stocks and bonds?
[02:10:03.895 --> 02:10:05.176]  Do you have firearms?
[02:10:05.176 --> 02:10:06.256]  What are your other businesses?
[02:10:06.256 --> 02:10:08.178]  Under penalty of law, you will tell us.
[02:10:08.178 --> 02:10:11.139]  Department of Commerce, they have no authority.
[02:10:11.139 --> 02:10:16.203]  The census is for the apportionment of members of Congress for your state.
[02:10:17.099 --> 02:10:21.021]  And it goes back to Leviticus and the numbering of the people with Moses.
[02:10:21.021 --> 02:10:23.143]  That's where it biblically comes from.
[02:10:23.143 --> 02:10:24.363]  And that's in the law.
[02:10:24.363 --> 02:10:25.304]  How many people live here?
[02:10:25.304 --> 02:10:26.485]  That's it.
[02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:31.608]  But they use a code through criminal fraud and tell you, oh, there's a code on this, you better do it.
[02:10:31.608 --> 02:10:36.371]  And I send it back to them and say, Fourth and Fifth Amendment, you know full well this is fraud.
[02:10:36.371 --> 02:10:39.493]  And they keep sending it and keep threatening and keep threatening criminal penalties.
[02:10:39.493 --> 02:10:40.753]  And of course, there really aren't any.
[02:10:40.753 --> 02:10:41.734]  It's all fraud.
[02:10:42.972 --> 02:10:44.353]  It's all fraud.
[02:10:44.353 --> 02:10:45.893]  It's all a criminal group.
[02:10:45.893 --> 02:10:50.455]  Just like they tell you it's the law that you've got to take vaccines to be in school, there is no law.
[02:10:50.455 --> 02:10:51.856]  To go to college, to go anywhere.
[02:10:51.856 --> 02:10:56.158]  And they have their fraudulent admissions to get into college to make you take all these shots.
[02:10:56.158 --> 02:10:57.879]  And then they say, well we have to protect others.
[02:10:57.879 --> 02:11:00.700]  If they've all taken the poison, they should be just fine.
[02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:05.102]  This is a government caught on record thousands of times killing people in secret tests.
[02:11:05.102 --> 02:11:07.043]  Why would you ever trust the government?
[02:11:07.583 --> 02:11:10.305]  Run by the foreign banks that created Adolf Hitler.
[02:11:10.305 --> 02:11:15.407]  Our government, the reason they took 30 plus thousand Nazi scientists in World War II back to the U.S.
[02:11:15.407 --> 02:11:17.889]  and England, they were coming home.
[02:11:17.889 --> 02:11:26.193]  The Nuremberg defense used for the eugenics and the mass extermination of millions was U.S.
[02:11:26.193 --> 02:11:29.015]  Cold Springs Harbor IBM directives.
[02:11:30.146 --> 02:11:32.627]  IBM ran the extermination operations.
[02:11:32.627 --> 02:11:35.828]  They were commanding it from the United States during it.
[02:11:35.828 --> 02:11:40.229]  That's why, up until the end of the war, they would say conspiracy theories, Hitler doesn't have death camps.
[02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:44.110]  That's why they have the conspiracy theory today that Hitler didn't have death camps.
[02:11:44.110 --> 02:11:46.230]  People think that's some new thing.
[02:11:46.230 --> 02:11:51.672]  No, Hitler had death camps, and they killed all sorts of people, folks.
[02:11:51.672 --> 02:11:54.133]  So, you better learn about all of this.
[02:11:54.133 --> 02:11:55.633]  IBM directed
[02:11:56.803 --> 02:11:58.323]  The entire operation.
[02:11:58.323 --> 02:12:04.145]  And IBM directs Microsoft, and IBM directs Google today.
[02:12:04.145 --> 02:12:06.606]  To get around antitrust, that's why they created all these groups.
[02:12:06.606 --> 02:12:10.267]  And of course, I told you that 15 plus years ago, it's now come out in the news.
[02:12:10.267 --> 02:12:11.368]  It's all fake.
[02:12:11.368 --> 02:12:14.789]  They've got attack barges with their surveillance grids off the shore.
[02:12:14.789 --> 02:12:16.849]  They've got the blimps already at 100,000 feet.
[02:12:16.849 --> 02:12:20.911]  They've even got microwave systems, they can fry you in your house with them.
[02:12:20.911 --> 02:12:22.011]  They've got it all.
[02:12:22.011 --> 02:12:25.112]  It's a breakaway society, a breakaway civilization, with
[02:12:26.517 --> 02:12:31.138]  Hundreds of trillions of dollars in the aggregate of assets that they've stolen.
[02:12:31.138 --> 02:12:42.820]  76% or higher on average of all your money since the 1313 plan in the 1950s is taken and put off short to destroy the money.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:44.961]  It doesn't go to even rich people.
[02:12:44.961 --> 02:12:45.881]  They have the income tax.
[02:12:45.881 --> 02:12:49.201]  Congressional Report 81 is to destroy you selectively.
[02:12:49.201 --> 02:12:51.762]  So they don't pay taxes and then your money's destroyed.
[02:12:53.507 --> 02:12:54.668]  You understand that?
[02:12:54.668 --> 02:12:57.491]  So that, quote, their money doesn't lose value.
[02:12:57.491 --> 02:13:07.241]  See, it's about artificial scarcity, where they have hyperinflation, where they get first use of the money, and then all the benefits to them, and then all the problems are to you.
[02:13:07.241 --> 02:13:09.823]  It's all scientific gang raping.
[02:13:10.583 --> 02:13:12.625]  I use that term because that's what it is.
[02:13:12.625 --> 02:13:15.648]  And of course you learn in Obamacare, 539% official humana letter to Texas insurance holders.
[02:13:15.648 --> 02:13:16.508]  They say you have a 539% increase.
[02:13:16.508 --> 02:13:18.630]  California, 200% plus.
[02:13:18.630 --> 02:13:19.951]  And then this is free health care.
[02:13:19.951 --> 02:13:20.692]  This is affordable health care.
[02:13:29.898 --> 02:13:30.920]  And of course, it's now come out.
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:31.581]  They knew the whole thing.
[02:13:31.581 --> 02:13:32.663]  It was all done on purpose.
[02:13:32.663 --> 02:13:34.025]  It's not a failure.
[02:13:34.025 --> 02:13:36.570]  They create the process where, oh, it's screwed up.
[02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:38.092]  Oh, I'm sorry for the website.
[02:13:38.092 --> 02:13:39.695]  Oh, I'm sorry you didn't get the free health care.
[02:13:39.695 --> 02:13:42.220]  It never had it in there unless you're an illegal.
[02:13:43.547 --> 02:13:47.049]  And that's only to bring them into the country as the incentive to drive down the wages.
[02:13:47.049 --> 02:13:50.552]  Now joining us is Max Keiser to get into all of this.
[02:13:50.552 --> 02:13:58.778]  Top stockbroker, retired, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange, virtual trading technologies for Callaghan Fitzgerald, now used on many stock markets in the world.
[02:13:58.778 --> 02:14:03.141]  And he joins us to break down what he calls the casino gulag model.
[02:14:04.124 --> 02:14:06.485]  And that's exactly what it is.
[02:14:06.485 --> 02:14:12.989]  And I want to get his take on just in Europe they're trying to ban any criticism of government.
[02:14:12.989 --> 02:14:14.330]  That was mainstream news yesterday.
[02:14:14.330 --> 02:14:17.091]  Here they're doing it as well because they have to.
[02:14:17.091 --> 02:14:18.913]  It's an authoritarian execution.
[02:14:18.913 --> 02:14:20.754]  So I've thrown out all these issues.
[02:14:20.754 --> 02:14:24.836]  What's happening worldwide, the QE Unlimited, the new Fed chief, all of it.
[02:14:24.836 --> 02:14:28.358]  We're going to talk Bitcoin, everything, to the balance of the hour with Max Keiser.
[02:14:28.358 --> 02:14:29.539]  But you heard my intro, Max.
[02:14:30.339 --> 02:14:35.286]  about how scientific this takeover is, in their own words.
[02:14:35.286 --> 02:14:44.379]  If this was a football game, where's free humanity on the board versus the corporate psycho guild who compete with each other on how evil they can be?
[02:14:44.379 --> 02:14:46.102]  Where is humanity right now, Max Keiser?
[02:14:47.349 --> 02:14:48.729]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:14:48.729 --> 02:14:52.870]  You know, I'm going to be trying to get down to Austin to see you in January.
[02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:54.050]  Come on down!
[02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:55.411]  Yeah, I'm looking forward to that trip.
[02:14:55.411 --> 02:15:01.012]  But listening to you talk right there, there's a couple of ideas that I have.
[02:15:01.012 --> 02:15:03.213]  One is called digital apartheid.
[02:15:03.213 --> 02:15:05.433]  The other one is called interest rate apartheid.
[02:15:05.433 --> 02:15:09.334]  So let's talk about digital apartheid for a second as it relates to Obamacare.
[02:15:10.094 --> 02:15:24.348]  If you notice, over the past few years, we have been exposed via the Snowden revelations to an unbelievably sophisticated digital infrastructure for spying that seems to work flawlessly.
[02:15:24.348 --> 02:15:29.393]  We also have been given Obamacare, which is a digital product that's a shambles.
[02:15:29.893 --> 02:15:31.614]  And this is the digital apartheid.
[02:15:31.614 --> 02:15:43.217]  If you live on the right side of the digital apartheid wall, you have access to flawless technology to spy, to commit corporate espionage, to commit all kinds of insider trading.
[02:15:43.217 --> 02:15:48.399]  If you live on the wrong side of the digital apartheid wall, you end up with Obamacare, which is like a ghetto.
[02:15:48.399 --> 02:15:49.299]  It's like a slum.
[02:15:49.299 --> 02:15:50.960]  And that's how they've always done it.
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:53.840]  Red tapes for the little guy, not for the globalists.
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:56.181]  This is literally like that stuff cops have.
[02:15:56.181 --> 02:15:56.761]  They can shoot.
[02:15:56.761 --> 02:15:58.622]  It's like goo to tie you down.
[02:15:59.878 --> 02:16:18.133]  Well you know red tape is bureaucracy has always been around and it slows things down and there's the state behind it and the state hires a lot of employees and there's too much state payroll that gets into in the way of building a vibrant economy but this is more
[02:16:18.613 --> 02:16:19.635]  Insidious than that.
[02:16:19.635 --> 02:16:28.326]  This is a program of what I call digital apartheid, where the program is to create two classes of individuals of have and have nots.
[02:16:28.326 --> 02:16:29.928]  Then there's interest rate apartheid.
[02:16:30.836 --> 02:16:43.702]  Which is, I've talked about this on your show before, if you are on the right side of the interest rate apartheid wall, you're a partner at Goldman Sachs, or you're a partner at one of these big firms, you can borrow money at 0%.
[02:16:43.702 --> 02:16:50.865]  But if you live on the wrong side of the apartheid wall, you end up paying 16%, 20%, 30%, or a payday loan.
[02:16:50.865 --> 02:16:57.088]  Here in the UK, they have a payday loan shop called Wanga that charges an annualized rate of interest of 5,000%.
[02:16:59.549 --> 02:17:09.318]  Uh, and these people that run the Wonga Payday loan shop are some of the biggest contributors to the conservative government, the Cameron government.
[02:17:09.318 --> 02:17:12.801]  So here you have the government supporting a company that charges 5,000%
[02:17:14.782 --> 02:17:15.203]  I don't know.
[02:17:36.744 --> 02:17:44.071]  Let me follow up on that a little bit because we live now in an interesting world where in the UK or in the United States
[02:17:59.423 --> 02:18:07.052]  The growth of the economy is not needed to support the economy.
[02:18:07.052 --> 02:18:08.814]  You don't need workers in the UK.
[02:18:08.814 --> 02:18:10.777]  You don't need workers in America.
[02:18:10.777 --> 02:18:12.779]  You don't need their tax revenues.
[02:18:12.779 --> 02:18:17.164]  Because the insiders, when they need money, they just print it.
[02:18:17.685 --> 02:18:22.626]  They just use either the Federal Reserve Bank or the Bank of England to print all the money they want.
[02:18:22.626 --> 02:18:23.707]  It's like Saudi Arabia.
[02:18:23.707 --> 02:18:30.228]  Saudi Arabia, you have a ruling elite and then you have the vast majority live in abject poverty.
[02:18:30.228 --> 02:18:33.469]  Because the ruling elite, whenever they need more money, they just turn on the oil tap.
[02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:36.410]  They're part of OPEC and they just drill for more oil.
[02:18:36.630 --> 02:18:37.971]  But they don't need the population.
[02:18:37.971 --> 02:18:44.374]  The population might get a bit of a stipend, but there's a huge gap between the princes and the rest of the population.
[02:18:44.374 --> 02:18:56.759]  In America, it's turning into the same thing, because you've got the princes on Wall Street who can just go to the Fed and get all the money they want, virtually unlimited amount of money at 0% interest rate.
[02:18:56.759 --> 02:18:58.000]  So that they don't need.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.001]  They don't need workers.
[02:18:59.001 --> 02:19:00.501]  They don't need your tax revenue.
[02:19:00.501 --> 02:19:01.182]  They don't need you.
[02:19:01.182 --> 02:19:01.842]  You're expendable.
[02:19:02.242 --> 02:19:03.163]  Beautifully said.
[02:19:03.163 --> 02:19:03.683]  Beautifully said.
[02:19:03.683 --> 02:19:22.217]  We're about to go to break, but then meanwhile, MSNBC and CNN, they're all debating all the racial division to keep us fighting with each other as we're all being abused by the foreign, offshore, above the law, tax-exempt mega-banks and the insurance companies making record profits on the Obamacare that they wrote.
[02:19:22.217 --> 02:19:27.641]  When we come back, I want you to elaborate on this genius way you put this, Max Keiser.
[02:19:28.422 --> 02:19:31.403]  Because it really is something people can crystallize and understand.
[02:19:31.403 --> 02:19:35.384]  This is the ultimate discrimination, the ultimate tax, debt, slavery.
[02:19:35.384 --> 02:19:38.104]  But I want to go back to the first apartheid, the digital.
[02:19:38.104 --> 02:19:51.307]  Because they said that going back about 18 years ago when they set up Internet2 Consortium, that they're going to kill the old web, surveil it, tax it, control it, but create their super private web for the top corporations and governments.
[02:19:51.307 --> 02:19:52.768]  And that's now what they're setting up.
[02:19:52.768 --> 02:19:53.708]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:19:56.109 --> 02:20:01.871]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:20:01.871 --> 02:20:09.254]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:20:09.254 --> 02:20:12.375]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:20:12.575 --> 02:20:14.596]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:20:14.596 --> 02:20:19.260]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:22.162]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:20:22.162 --> 02:20:28.126]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.

[02:23:25.325 --> 02:23:34.629]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:23:34.629 --> 02:23:35.429]  This capitalism?
[02:23:35.429 --> 02:23:41.592]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:23:41.592 --> 02:23:45.273]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:23:45.273 --> 02:23:46.233]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:23:46.233 --> 02:23:47.274]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:23:47.274 --> 02:23:47.614]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:47.614 --> 02:23:47.954]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:24:02.762 --> 02:24:08.963]  Folks, if you've been sitting it out and not fighting the tyrants and not getting involved, you are under scientific attack.
[02:24:08.963 --> 02:24:10.764]  And you should take that personal.
[02:24:10.764 --> 02:24:19.826]  I'll guarantee if I walked up to an average guy that doesn't even think of himself as a tough guy and slapped his wife right across the face, he'd get up and fight me.
[02:24:19.826 --> 02:24:27.928]  I guarantee if I walked up to just a regular 150-pound, you know, guy that thinks he's a wimp, started punching his five-year-old son in the face, he'd get up and fight me.
[02:24:30.668 --> 02:24:39.158]  If your neighbor came over every day and had their dog go to the bathroom, and right in front of you, you'd come out and say, hey, quit doing that, Bob.
[02:24:39.158 --> 02:24:42.142]  But the globalists do all these horrible things to us.
[02:24:42.142 --> 02:24:45.025]  I mean, they are openly under the federal government.
[02:24:45.922 --> 02:24:48.523]  Teaching 2 plus 2 equals 5 in Common Core.
[02:24:48.523 --> 02:24:50.763]  You're not allowed to say mother and father, that's hurtful.
[02:24:50.763 --> 02:24:56.945]  Russell Brand's been told by Salon that it's hateful to women to say that he thought a woman was beautiful.
[02:24:56.945 --> 02:24:58.645]  It's a war on reality.
[02:24:58.645 --> 02:25:01.626]  These are not liberals, they're authoritarians.
[02:25:01.626 --> 02:25:04.907]  And they work with the fake right-wing people as well.
[02:25:04.907 --> 02:25:07.508]  That's why the Republican leadership's coming out to the Tea Party right now.
[02:25:07.508 --> 02:25:09.768]  The real Ron Paul Tea Party, folks.
[02:25:09.768 --> 02:25:12.609]  Not the co-opted one that Karl Rove tried to take over.
[02:25:13.635 --> 02:25:14.535]  He failed.
[02:25:14.535 --> 02:25:14.976]  But look at this.
[02:25:14.976 --> 02:25:19.497]  School test teaches kids commands of government officials must be obeyed by all.
[02:25:19.497 --> 02:25:22.678]  I forgot to call 590, our local affiliate, and get it.
[02:25:22.678 --> 02:25:23.999]  About a month ago, I got to get this.
[02:25:23.999 --> 02:25:27.500]  I want you guys to call him for the last time Arte Cerveda was on the morning show.
[02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:33.562]  He said, point blank, obey a police officer's commands no matter if you know they're wrong or illegal.
[02:25:33.562 --> 02:25:35.163]  And you quote, won't get hurt.
[02:25:36.414 --> 02:25:40.599]  That flies in the face of common law, common sense, the Constitution.
[02:25:40.599 --> 02:25:42.361]  And, you know, I don't even like to attack the police chief.
[02:25:42.361 --> 02:25:44.903]  He's very charming, says he's my friend and all this.
[02:25:44.903 --> 02:25:47.286]  But the point is, he says so much evil stuff.
[02:25:47.286 --> 02:25:48.487]  That's what they're teaching.
[02:25:48.487 --> 02:25:51.450]  Total submission to government is tyranny.
[02:25:51.450 --> 02:25:53.072]  It's a recipe for hell on earth.
[02:25:53.072 --> 02:25:54.073]  Guaranteed.
[02:25:54.073 --> 02:25:56.876]  Max, there's a short segment, long segment coming up, but your eloquent breakdown.
[02:25:57.657 --> 02:26:14.643]  It is so key about how, and this is the essence, they get us obsessing on saying brown bag is racist, you'll be, you'll be, lose your job if you work for the government in Seattle if you bring a brown bag, because that's, there's no history of that being racist, no claim, no nothing.
[02:26:14.643 --> 02:26:18.164]  Just means cheap, you know, paper, you put your lunch in, everybody knows that.
[02:26:18.164 --> 02:26:23.706]  But if they can expand it out to everything's racist except really hurting everybody,
[02:26:25.086 --> 02:26:26.267]  I mean, it's so elementary.
[02:26:26.267 --> 02:26:37.119]  They want us looking at all this other side stuff that isn't even real in most cases, while they engage in the electronic and in the other forms of apartheid.
[02:26:37.119 --> 02:26:38.860]  Please continue, Max Keiser.
[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:43.025]  Yeah, well, I'll add to this apartheid theme.
[02:26:43.025 --> 02:26:45.147]  We talked about interest rate apartheid.
[02:26:45.147 --> 02:26:46.728]  We talked about digital apartheid.
[02:26:47.389 --> 02:26:54.592]  There's another form of apartheid, and it goes back to what you were saying earlier about Nazis in Germany, and of course they had a lot of U.S.
[02:26:54.592 --> 02:27:00.995]  corporations like IBM, Coca-Cola, and JP Morgan were very active supporting the Nazis at that time.
[02:27:00.995 --> 02:27:04.257]  So was Walt Disney and the Disney Corporation.
[02:27:04.717 --> 02:27:10.820]  And we see evidence of this today with the what I would say is a copyright apartheid.
[02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:17.943]  You see, the history of the Internet is about really the Internet versus Walt Disney Corporation and Hollywood.
[02:27:17.943 --> 02:27:24.946]  Disney has every 20 years fought in Congress to extend copyright to protect Mickey Mouse.
[02:27:25.066 --> 02:27:28.828]  Because every 20 years, Mickey Mouse is set to enter the public domain.
[02:27:28.828 --> 02:27:34.932]  Now remember, Thomas Jefferson argued that there should not be any intellectual property rights, that everything should be in the public domain.
[02:27:34.932 --> 02:27:41.216]  But they compromised, and they gave intellectual property a 14-year copyright monopoly plus a 14-year extension.
[02:27:41.216 --> 02:27:45.679]  Well, thanks to Disney, that copyright is now lifetime plus 70 years.
[02:27:46.559 --> 02:27:53.124]  Or what Lawrence Lessig would call, he's a professor at Stanford University, a perpetual copyright.
[02:27:53.124 --> 02:28:09.077]  And why this qualifies as apartheid versus the internet and why it's active right now is that corporations in Hollywood want you, or they want to force the price of ideas and intellectual property up, just like they're forcing everything else up, out of reach from the general
[02:28:09.577 --> 02:28:10.799]  But it's worse than that.
[02:28:10.799 --> 02:28:21.031]  Under these treaties, as you know, Max, they're trying to get through, they put controls on your speech before it's made, which is a total form of slavery in the name of protecting their copyright.
[02:28:21.513 --> 02:28:27.918]  But that's all put in place to protect Disney's and other intellectual property rights monopolies.
[02:28:27.918 --> 02:28:36.745]  And you saw this played out last year spectacularly when the MPAA, headed up by Chris Dodd, went after Aaron Schwarz.
[02:28:36.745 --> 02:28:41.788]  And according to his father at the funeral, Aaron Schwarz was hounded to death by the government.
[02:28:41.788 --> 02:28:42.929]  Aaron Schwarz killed himself.
[02:28:42.929 --> 02:28:44.050]  Yeah, they really murdered him.
[02:28:44.050 --> 02:28:44.811]  It's clear they murdered him.
[02:28:45.151 --> 02:28:50.858]  They threatened him with 50 or 60 years in prison and they tried to get a plea bargain for two or three years in prison.
[02:28:50.858 --> 02:28:51.939]  He was getting married.
[02:28:51.939 --> 02:28:53.021]  He said, I'm not giving up.
[02:28:53.021 --> 02:28:53.862]  I'm gonna beat him.
[02:28:53.862 --> 02:28:54.823]  He was becoming a hero.
[02:28:54.823 --> 02:28:56.965]  They came to his house and hung him, but go ahead.
[02:28:56.965 --> 02:29:04.835]  Well, they, Aaron Schwartz, effectively was a martyr for this idea of intellectual property freedom on the internet.
[02:29:04.955 --> 02:29:18.159]  And this is another insidious form of apartheid that you see playing out and creating this vast gap between information that's freely available and information that now costs money.
[02:29:18.159 --> 02:29:23.921]  Hollywood wants the internet to be like HBO, where everyone pays to view and you don't create anything yourself.
[02:29:23.921 --> 02:29:28.402]  Because every time you try to create something for yourself on the internet, you have to reference something else.
[02:29:28.402 --> 02:29:30.823]  Because all creation is referenced from all other creation.
[02:29:31.803 --> 02:29:32.504]  We're coming back.
[02:29:32.504 --> 02:29:33.324]  We're coming back.
[02:29:33.324 --> 02:29:34.985]  Long segment.
[02:29:34.985 --> 02:29:35.845]  I want to break this down.
[02:29:35.845 --> 02:29:38.066]  This is so key here.
[02:29:38.066 --> 02:29:39.807]  With Max Keiser, MaxKeiser.com.
[02:29:39.807 --> 02:29:43.208]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:29:43.208 --> 02:29:45.349]  We'll give you his Twitter when we come back.
[02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:46.730]  We're on the march.
[02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:49.271]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:49.271 --> 02:29:51.932]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:56.710 --> 02:30:02.174]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:30:02.174 --> 02:30:11.081]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:30:11.081 --> 02:30:18.907]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:30:18.907 --> 02:30:26.293]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[02:30:30.756 --> 02:30:34.940]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[02:30:56.249 --> 02:31:02.892]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:31:02.892 --> 02:31:08.035]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:31:08.035 --> 02:31:16.759]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:31:16.759 --> 02:31:20.821]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:31:20.821 --> 02:31:23.082]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:31:25.254 --> 02:31:29.837]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:31:29.837 --> 02:31:33.680]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:34.921]  Others don't.
[02:31:34.921 --> 02:31:37.062]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:31:37.062 --> 02:31:38.844]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:31:38.844 --> 02:31:41.746]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:31:41.746 --> 02:31:48.370]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:31:51.072 --> 02:31:53.434]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:31:53.434 --> 02:31:54.295]  Others don't.
[02:31:55.629 --> 02:31:59.934]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[02:31:59.934 --> 02:32:05.821]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere, and the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[02:32:05.821 --> 02:32:11.628]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[02:32:11.628 --> 02:32:15.153]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.
[02:32:15.553 --> 02:32:22.719]  Supernatural Silver offers a safe and effective means of fighting pathogens and can help defeat the root of these problems.
[02:32:22.719 --> 02:32:32.348]  Supernatural Silver is effective against more than 500 different disease-causing pathogens without encouraging drug resistance and without side effects.

[02:33:05.359 --> 02:33:06.940]  You want answers?
[02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:08.242]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:08.242 --> 02:33:12.506]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.179 --> 02:33:30.422]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's the bottom line.
[02:33:30.422 --> 02:33:42.772]  There is a scientific system of total control, in the globalist's own words, that has been basically established in this country and worldwide.
[02:33:42.772 --> 02:33:45.434]  And the globalists admit this in their own words.
[02:33:45.434 --> 02:33:47.436]  Gamed stock markets, just like casinos.
[02:33:49.039 --> 02:33:54.900]  And then we've got a major East Coast casino owner in the news saying, let's nuke Iran preemptively.
[02:33:54.900 --> 02:34:08.983]  It's literally ruled by mafia, by gangsters, by thugs who have used the development of technological systems to wage war on reality and to wage war on any independent opposition.
[02:34:08.983 --> 02:34:12.004]  That's why they instinctively want to get rid of the middle class.
[02:34:12.004 --> 02:34:13.884]  I mean, this is really a horrible situation.
[02:34:14.910 --> 02:34:16.551]  And I don't know how we get out of it.
[02:34:16.551 --> 02:34:18.311]  I don't know how we controvert it.
[02:34:18.311 --> 02:34:25.214]  I don't know how we pull out of it, because it's so bad.
[02:34:25.214 --> 02:34:27.935]  It's so serious.
[02:34:27.935 --> 02:34:32.356]  It's so unspeakable.
[02:34:32.356 --> 02:34:34.397]  And it's so documented.
[02:34:34.397 --> 02:34:37.518]  We're going to go back to Max Keiser here in just a moment, but here are some of the headlines.
[02:34:45.441 --> 02:34:46.021]  That's the quote.
[02:34:46.021 --> 02:34:48.362]  She says it's all her fault.
[02:34:48.362 --> 02:34:48.762]  Here it is.
[02:34:48.762 --> 02:34:50.083]  We have it queued up, don't we?
[02:34:50.083 --> 02:34:54.965]  Hold me accountable for this debacle.
[02:34:54.965 --> 02:34:57.346]  And then hold Obama, and then he leaves.
[02:34:57.346 --> 02:35:00.827]  No, it's the big insurance companies owned by the big banks that wrote this.
[02:35:00.827 --> 02:35:02.608]  And by the way, they're in the news.
[02:35:03.715 --> 02:35:07.939]  Doubling their profits since it passed three years ago and set to double them again.
[02:35:07.939 --> 02:35:15.585]  And they're in the news saying, no, we want it fully implemented because we want the really big quadruple profits.
[02:35:15.585 --> 02:35:24.853]  Here is the headline, insurers oppose Obamacare extension as a danger to profits.
[02:35:24.853 --> 02:35:29.817]  And that's being put out in press releases and on the news.
[02:35:30.816 --> 02:35:33.678]  This is the type of stuff that's going on.
[02:35:33.678 --> 02:35:36.881]  This is from Businessweek, from Bloomberg.
[02:35:36.881 --> 02:35:41.044]  And literally, I have Obamacare supporters call up and they go, no, it'll get fixed later.
[02:35:41.044 --> 02:35:42.125]  I want my free stuff.
[02:35:42.125 --> 02:35:43.827]  You could get free charity care.
[02:35:43.827 --> 02:35:48.450]  Now, this bill lets hospitals, even charity ones, refuse you.
[02:35:48.450 --> 02:35:50.132]  And I gave the subsection.
[02:35:50.132 --> 02:35:51.233]  I had medical doctors on.
[02:35:51.233 --> 02:35:53.094]  We warned you.
[02:35:53.094 --> 02:35:54.395]  It's death panels.
[02:35:54.395 --> 02:35:55.116]  It's death.
[02:35:55.116 --> 02:35:56.037]  It's pure evil.
[02:35:56.037 --> 02:35:58.539]  But you guys have to admit you've been conned.
[02:35:59.670 --> 02:36:02.534]  Where the buck stops, some see a bystander.
[02:36:02.534 --> 02:36:04.937]  New York Times whitewashing for Obama.
[02:36:04.937 --> 02:36:09.443]  I want to get into the digital apartheid and other systems of apartheid with Max Keiser.
[02:36:09.443 --> 02:36:15.230]  But Max, specifically on Obamacare, we called it, we broke it down, we knew what it would be.
[02:36:16.414 --> 02:36:18.155]  This is the opposite of social health care.
[02:36:18.155 --> 02:36:19.656]  Folks don't even want that.
[02:36:19.656 --> 02:36:21.796]  Why is the system so bold now?
[02:36:21.796 --> 02:36:25.358]  Is it that it's not just one dictator or one ruling party?
[02:36:25.358 --> 02:36:28.540]  It's a global corporate group above the law, tax exempt.
[02:36:28.540 --> 02:36:32.521]  They know the public's not sophisticated enough to figure out how it's happening.
[02:36:32.521 --> 02:36:34.662]  And so it's free reign.
[02:36:34.662 --> 02:36:42.506]  But shouldn't the elite themselves be scared of their own hubris and the fact that they have free reign?
[02:36:42.506 --> 02:36:44.507]  The system in place now is a dictatorship.
[02:36:45.731 --> 02:37:02.822]  So, you have Obama as a figurehead for a dictatorship, and a dictatorship doesn't really have to answer to anybody, and they'll put you in prison, and people will gladly go to prison if you give them, you know, free access to online gambling, etc.
[02:37:02.822 --> 02:37:05.584]  What I call the prison gulag mentality, the model.
[02:37:05.584 --> 02:37:08.646]  But I wanted to get back to this whole copyright apartheid idea, because
[02:37:09.406 --> 02:37:23.367]  You know, it's funny, you play the Star Wars music and the Star Wars theme on your show, and of course, Star Wars, the original Star Wars, when that was being written by Lucas, he consulted very heavily with Joseph Campbell, who wrote the very famous book, A Hero with a Thousand Faces.
[02:37:25.330 --> 02:37:30.771]  Yes, archetypes and the recurrence of archetypes and stories throughout history.
[02:37:30.771 --> 02:37:43.494]  The problem with this copyright lifetime plus 70 copyright regime that Hollywood wants and is imposing is that when people try to write new stories, Hollywood says, no, we own the rights to those stories.
[02:37:43.494 --> 02:37:50.115]  So they are by creating this division between you and access to your own history.
[02:37:50.635 --> 02:38:10.165]  To access to your own being as a human being and part of a long ongoing history, they have created effectively a digital lobotomy because people cannot even access ideas anymore without being billed by one of these Hollywood or intellectual property behemoths like a Microsoft, etc.
[02:38:10.825 --> 02:38:26.317]  So this is how they've created this digital lobotomy by using copyright law and copyright extension law so that it's lifetime plus 70 years and claiming that all the stories, all the hero with a thousand faces, all the thousand stories throughout history are owned by these corporations.
[02:38:26.317 --> 02:38:27.378]  Disney took
[02:38:28.078 --> 02:38:33.884]  German folktales, like Snow White and others, and copyrighted them.
[02:38:33.884 --> 02:38:35.786]  Now they claim that they own those stories.
[02:38:35.786 --> 02:38:39.510]  So now people try to do stories like that, they get sued by Disney.
[02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:43.774]  Same thing, they took Hans Christensen's The Little Mermaid.
[02:38:44.435 --> 02:38:47.657]  And then copyrighted it when it was open source.
[02:38:47.657 --> 02:38:47.878]  Right.
[02:38:47.878 --> 02:38:57.104]  So they've taken that public domain of stories that we've, you know, taken hundreds of thousands of years to develop and they claim ownership.
[02:38:57.104 --> 02:39:02.128]  And so now when you go to try to be creative and that's part of being a human being is to be creative, create things.
[02:39:02.128 --> 02:39:07.451]  But if you don't have access to even being creative because someone will come down to you and say that we own that.
[02:39:07.451 --> 02:39:08.152]  You can't use that idea.
[02:39:08.152 --> 02:39:09.953]  By the way, it's Hans Christian Anderson.
[02:39:09.953 --> 02:39:11.194]  I was going from memory there.
[02:39:12.495 --> 02:39:30.953]  You're absolutely right and they're now even taking the classics that are open source and then saying this printing is copyright and then going after people who then put out a movie off of that claiming that they've copyrighted it or they'll take government film footage of nukes going off and then do a false copyright and for those that don't know
[02:39:31.934 --> 02:39:43.877]  There's been a bunch of companies out there that if you just take a snippet of an article and put it in your article, we've had AP and people tell us, you can't even put a paragraph of our stuff in an article quoting us.
[02:39:43.877 --> 02:39:47.238]  And I'm like, but it's totally fair use.
[02:39:47.238 --> 02:39:51.699]  We've had Warner Brothers and I challenged them and had to do it behind the scenes in court and they backed off.
[02:39:51.699 --> 02:39:54.400]  Saying, I can't review Batman.
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:16.486]  There's a provision called fair use and fair use is for educational purposes and other purposes and there used to be a thing called a public library where you could go in and read a book, take out a book for a week and read that book but now these libraries have been totally infiltrated and this whole idea of fair use has been subverted so that there is no more fair use and you end up when this
[02:40:16.926 --> 02:40:21.647]  Actually, Google came out last month and said they are reading your email to make sure nothing copyright is in it.
[02:40:44.912 --> 02:40:50.020]  Right, so either they will just push you off the grid, so that's part of the digital apartheid.
[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:52.203]  Now you're living in a digital no-man's land.
[02:40:52.203 --> 02:40:56.831]  Or they send you a bill, and if you can't pay the bill, they'll lend you money at 16, 17, 18 percent.
[02:40:56.831 --> 02:40:57.992]  That's an interest rate apartheid.
[02:40:59.123 --> 02:41:02.745]  Or they'll just stick you in one of their other prisons.
[02:41:02.745 --> 02:41:05.766]  And remember what McCain said about six years ago.
[02:41:05.766 --> 02:41:10.789]  He said, we'll blow your computer up with remote commands, fry your computer.
[02:41:10.789 --> 02:41:12.069]  That's what they want.
[02:41:12.069 --> 02:41:12.710]  Total control.
[02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:14.130]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:41:14.130 --> 02:41:18.692]  Economically, geopolitically, how are things going for the kleptocrats?
[02:41:18.692 --> 02:41:19.933]  What do you make of the $13 million fines?
[02:41:22.914 --> 02:41:27.859]  On companies like Chase at the top of the pyramid, slap on the wrist.
[02:41:27.859 --> 02:41:29.841]  Other points that are important, Max?
[02:41:29.841 --> 02:41:43.895]  Well, the greatest thing I saw in the last week was the quote that came out between a meeting between Barack Obama and Eric Schmidt, the Google chair, where Barack Obama asked Eric Schmidt, should we be worried about Bitcoin?
[02:41:45.334 --> 02:41:51.021]  And of course Eric Schmidt was clueless even about what Bitcoin was at that moment.
[02:41:51.021 --> 02:41:59.851]  In the meantime, Bitcoin has surged to become the napster of currencies, to totally be threatening to all central banks and bankers.
[02:42:00.011 --> 02:42:00.932]  Who is really behind Bitcoin?
[02:42:19.975 --> 02:42:22.997]  They are activists who hate bankers.
[02:42:22.997 --> 02:42:42.789]  So you've got a group of folks back in 2009 who put what's called a Bitcoin protocol onto the internet, which is I think the most remarkable piece of technology and insight since going back to Copernicus, you know, who reasoned that in fact the Sun was at the center of the solar system and not the Earth.
[02:42:42.789 --> 02:42:44.810]  At the time, he got a lot of flack for that.
[02:42:45.350 --> 02:43:01.193]  The creators of Bitcoin have figured out that you could take the encryption algorithms used for sending encrypted emails and you could turn that into a currency that would be completely stateless and completely safe to use outside of all government interference.
[02:43:01.193 --> 02:43:03.974]  It's a complete ingenious idea.
[02:43:03.974 --> 02:43:06.675]  And it is changing the entire global economy.
[02:43:06.675 --> 02:43:07.615]  I want to be clear.
[02:43:07.615 --> 02:43:08.255]  I want to be clear.
[02:43:08.935 --> 02:43:11.819]  I totally believe in free, open, digital currencies.
[02:43:11.819 --> 02:43:13.421]  Believe it is the way of the future.
[02:43:13.421 --> 02:43:23.492]  It gives the power of fiat to the people and the power of choice and a bunch will emerge and whatever's the most trusted and the best will become preeminent and it could take the globalist out of the equation.
[02:43:23.492 --> 02:43:25.995]  My issue is I believe whatever the first big one is...
[02:43:26.536 --> 02:43:29.480]  They're going to try to sabotage it, demonize it, come after it.
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:40.135]  So I haven't endorsed it to my listeners because I, when it comes, you know, ends up getting brought down if it does, I don't want to be connected to that just because I understand how volatile and dangerous it is.
[02:43:40.135 --> 02:43:41.877]  But I think out of pure speculation...
[02:43:43.058 --> 02:43:43.578]  Look at this.
[02:43:43.578 --> 02:43:45.700]  So they busted Silk Road recently.
[02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:49.522]  Silk Road online marketplace for a lot of illicit activity was going on.
[02:43:49.522 --> 02:43:52.724]  The FBI creator.
[02:43:52.724 --> 02:43:56.707]  They then found themselves in possession of lots of bitcoins.
[02:43:56.707 --> 02:43:57.668]  Some of the bitcoins
[02:43:59.141 --> 02:44:02.703]  They found the password and discovered 30 or 35 million dollars.
[02:44:02.703 --> 02:44:09.528]  Other bitcoins that they did not have the password to, they are completely incapable of cracking into that Bitcoin cash.
[02:44:09.528 --> 02:44:15.752]  Because the Bitcoin network right now is bigger than 500 supercomputers.
[02:44:15.752 --> 02:44:19.614]  It's something like 60,000 computers distributed around the world.
[02:44:19.614 --> 02:44:27.039]  They go through this Bitcoin protocol and they're discovering what you could call precious numbers that are as precious as precious metals or precious diamonds.
[02:44:27.119 --> 02:44:30.602]  Sure, that's what they do with the whole fiat banking system, using it against us.
[02:44:30.602 --> 02:44:31.742]  This inverts it.
[02:44:31.742 --> 02:44:37.026]  The fiat banking system is money that has no intrinsic value whatsoever.
[02:44:37.026 --> 02:44:39.988]  Bitcoins have intrinsic value, like gold or silver.
[02:44:39.988 --> 02:44:41.570]  And that's the big difference.
[02:44:41.570 --> 02:44:44.612]  And explain why they do it, because people put original value into it?
[02:44:46.345 --> 02:44:47.586]  Because there's two reasons.
[02:44:47.586 --> 02:44:57.596]  The system that it requires to solve the mathematical equations to unlock these numbers is so huge that that itself is the value.
[02:44:57.596 --> 02:44:58.657]  The value is the network.
[02:44:58.657 --> 02:44:59.918]  The network is the value.
[02:44:59.918 --> 02:45:03.581]  And then the numbers themselves are extraordinarily valuable.
[02:45:03.581 --> 02:45:08.666]  For example, as you know, as your listeners probably know, there's been an ongoing hunt for prime numbers.
[02:45:08.846 --> 02:45:14.810]  And prime numbers are very rare and scientists are looking for these prime numbers and they are very happy to find one.
[02:45:14.810 --> 02:45:28.200]  The Bitcoin protocol is similar in that it finds numbers that fit in with the protocol that are also extremely rare and you need this network of thousands and thousands of computers working simultaneously to unlock these numbers.
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:30.161]  So that's the intrinsic value.
[02:45:30.161 --> 02:45:33.584]  Then it has all the attributes of a currency and it's a medium of exchange.
[02:45:34.204 --> 02:45:35.964]  So now I understand your point.
[02:45:35.964 --> 02:45:39.405]  You know, you don't want to jump into it and recommend something that will blow up.
[02:45:39.405 --> 02:45:41.866]  Let's wait to see if it has a good adoption rate.
[02:45:41.866 --> 02:45:47.767]  At the moment, if you read the Bitcoin press, you notice that it does have an excellent adoption rate.
[02:45:47.767 --> 02:45:54.089]  You've got people like SecondMarket in New York City that have introduced the Bitcoin Investment Trust, where it's now become an asset class.
[02:45:54.089 --> 02:45:59.530]  Sure, that makes me think that it might have elitists behind it who want to control this type of technology when it comes out.
[02:45:59.530 --> 02:46:01.571]  So they can't blame, you know, you can't blame
[02:46:02.091 --> 02:46:05.953]  Hedge funds necessarily for wanting to jump into things that make money.
[02:46:05.953 --> 02:46:07.474]  Hedge funds are also stateless.
[02:46:07.474 --> 02:46:08.515]  Hedge funds are... No, no, no.
[02:46:08.515 --> 02:46:09.035]  I get it.
[02:46:09.035 --> 02:46:09.555]  I get it.
[02:46:09.555 --> 02:46:11.116]  I understand all that.
[02:46:11.116 --> 02:46:11.736]  I understand that.
[02:46:11.736 --> 02:46:15.398]  But listen, getting off of Bitcoin for a moment, because there's so much other stuff going on.
[02:46:15.398 --> 02:46:17.280]  What is the state of the global economy?
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:18.540]  What's happening with the bond market?
[02:46:18.540 --> 02:46:22.262]  What are your predictions for gold, for war?
[02:46:22.262 --> 02:46:26.124]  I mean, let's take a walk on the waterfront here.
[02:46:26.124 --> 02:46:26.845]  Tell me what's going on.
[02:46:28.052 --> 02:46:31.813]  Well, in the UK and in the US, they're very similar.
[02:46:31.813 --> 02:46:39.915]  I think in the UK, it's really more of a good demonstration of what is going on than anywhere else right now.
[02:46:39.915 --> 02:46:51.278]  The central banker in charge, Mark Carney, the new guy who came in from Canada, he has just announced that he wants to expand the balance sheet of the Bank of England up to $9 trillion.
[02:46:51.278 --> 02:46:54.919]  They've already expanded it from $800 billion four and a half years ago to
[02:46:56.119 --> 02:46:56.500]  I think
[02:47:18.109 --> 02:47:18.609]  I think so.
[02:47:37.156 --> 02:47:39.557]  So he's becoming the enormous garbage collector.
[02:47:39.557 --> 02:47:41.498]  He's a Bernie Madoff on steroids.
[02:47:41.498 --> 02:47:44.440]  He's a Bernie Madoff to the 10th degree.
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:50.502]  And the UK economy, as a result, you've got another apartheid happening in terms of housing.
[02:47:50.502 --> 02:47:57.526]  You've got rich oligarchs who get the money for free and then buy apartments and they've pushed out everybody else.
[02:47:58.266 --> 02:48:03.687]  Very few people can afford to live in the city of London anymore who are not part of the oligarch class.
[02:48:03.687 --> 02:48:09.188]  People are just fleeing the city because it's too freaking expensive because exactly what Mark Carney's doing.
[02:48:09.188 --> 02:48:15.629]  So he's put on the we are open sign to every crook and oligarch in the world.
[02:48:15.629 --> 02:48:23.251]  They'll take all the toxic debts that you accumulated in all the dodgy deals you did over the past five to ten years and we'll swap you with fresh
[02:48:23.891 --> 02:48:27.973]  Guilt, pound guilt, and you can keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[02:48:27.973 --> 02:48:31.295]  Now, we see the same thing in America.
[02:48:31.295 --> 02:48:34.877]  There was the farce of let's taper from the Federal Reserve.
[02:48:34.877 --> 02:48:40.260]  That was a farce as your guest Peter Schiff, you know, has said on your show brilliantly and elsewhere.
[02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:47.227]  There's not going to be any taper of buying by the Fed of treasuries to keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[02:48:47.227 --> 02:48:53.273]  There is a high likelihood that they will expand quantitative easing from $85 billion a month to $100, $120.
[02:48:53.273 --> 02:49:01.621]  You know, Mark Faber said on a show on CNBC last week, he would anticipate quantitative easing could go to a trillion dollars a month.
[02:49:02.202 --> 02:49:08.804]  I mean, that sounds incredible, but if you go back to Weimar Republic, Germany in the mid-twenties, the currency crashed.
[02:49:08.804 --> 02:49:09.685]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:49:09.685 --> 02:49:10.365]  We've got to go to break.
[02:49:10.365 --> 02:49:10.725]  Stay there.
[02:49:10.725 --> 02:49:15.567]  Come back and tell us more and tell us about some of the other projects you're working on and what you see coming up in the future.
[02:49:15.567 --> 02:49:18.408]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com is our guest.
[02:49:19.048 --> 02:49:25.814]  He'll be leaving us in about 10-12 minutes and we'll take some calls and we have another special guest joining us just briefly here folks.
[02:49:25.814 --> 02:49:28.576]  Some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[02:49:28.576 --> 02:49:33.000]  Shoppers submit to naked body scans to enter candy store.
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:34.161]  I'm not joking.
[02:49:34.161 --> 02:49:37.124]  That's up on InfoWars.com breaking right now.
[02:49:37.124 --> 02:49:40.306]  Shoppers submit to naked body scans to enter
[02:49:41.434 --> 02:49:43.255]  Candy Store.
[02:49:43.255 --> 02:49:46.857]  Also, Facebook photo shows another Google mystery barge off the coast of Maine.
[02:49:46.857 --> 02:49:48.938]  I'm going to ask Max if he knows what these are.
[02:49:48.938 --> 02:49:49.918]  I happen to have some intel.
[02:49:49.918 --> 02:49:53.600]  They're just getting ready to go completely offshore with their criminal ops.
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:56.402]  White House orders insurance companies not to criticize Obamacare.
[02:49:57.150 --> 02:49:59.672]  Well, I mean, they wrote it, so why would they criticize it?
[02:49:59.672 --> 02:50:03.396]  Well, they mean small ones that didn't write it, and it's meant to shut them down.
[02:50:03.396 --> 02:50:06.378]  Don't defend yourself, just lay down, or you're racist.
[02:50:06.378 --> 02:50:08.340]  Ten signs that Obamacare is going to wreck the U.S.
[02:50:08.340 --> 02:50:08.860]  economy.
[02:50:08.860 --> 02:50:09.281]  Betrayed.
[02:50:09.281 --> 02:50:13.965]  Democrats now admit they knew all along that millions would lose their existing health plans.
[02:50:13.965 --> 02:50:17.128]  And that's just some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[02:50:17.128 --> 02:50:19.270]  And Google's out promoting brain chips again.
[02:50:19.270 --> 02:50:20.511]  It's the latest, trendiest thing.
[02:50:20.511 --> 02:50:21.372]  If you don't like it, you're
[02:50:21.892 --> 02:50:23.374]  You're just a square.
[02:50:23.374 --> 02:50:24.615]  Briefly going to break here.
[02:50:24.615 --> 02:50:27.658]  We have more of it coming in today and more of it coming in next week.

[02:50:56.539 --> 02:51:01.883]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[02:51:01.883 --> 02:51:03.525]  What are bitcoins?
[02:51:03.525 --> 02:51:10.010]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[02:51:10.010 --> 02:51:11.831]  No bank needed.
[02:51:11.831 --> 02:51:17.515]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[02:51:17.515 --> 02:51:19.297]  You are in control of your money.
[02:51:19.777 --> 02:51:20.939]  And the best part?
[02:51:20.939 --> 02:51:24.563]  You can start earning and making money with bitcoins right away.
[02:51:24.563 --> 02:51:32.452]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[02:51:32.452 --> 02:51:36.097]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[02:51:55.885 --> 02:52:01.629]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:52:01.629 --> 02:52:09.014]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:52:09.014 --> 02:52:12.136]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:52:12.336 --> 02:52:14.357]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:52:14.357 --> 02:52:19.021]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:52:19.021 --> 02:52:21.923]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:52:21.923 --> 02:52:27.887]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:52:27.887 --> 02:52:31.569]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:52:31.569 --> 02:52:36.813]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[02:52:36.813 --> 02:52:39.755]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:52:39.975 --> 02:52:45.958]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[02:53:46.236 --> 02:53:47.977]  No one knows what it's like to be the Batman.
[02:54:04.331 --> 02:54:19.005]  This song's politically incorrect.
[02:54:19.005 --> 02:54:21.567]  You talked about the color of somebody's eyes.
[02:54:21.567 --> 02:54:23.909]  That might have hurt somebody's feelings.
[02:54:23.909 --> 02:54:26.131]  Like France, who's banned the word mother and father.
[02:54:29.801 --> 02:54:38.726]  I think this is the best Who song.
[02:54:38.726 --> 02:54:42.108]  I can't imagine telling lies.
[02:54:42.108 --> 02:54:47.231]  It's so easy to tell the truth.
[02:54:47.231 --> 02:54:50.473]  You either love the truth, or you hate it.
[02:54:52.543 --> 02:54:55.185]  Alright, Max Keiser's with us.
[02:54:55.185 --> 02:54:56.626]  We appreciate him joining us.
[02:54:56.626 --> 02:54:59.148]  Max, you were getting into this whole economic thing.
[02:54:59.148 --> 02:55:01.250]  Obviously, it's going towards hyperinflation.
[02:55:01.250 --> 02:55:04.273]  They're putting police states in place to control things during that period.
[02:55:05.734 --> 02:55:07.235]  Can they get away with everything?
[02:55:07.235 --> 02:55:11.957]  They seem to think they can, but as you pointed out, Eric Schmidt didn't know what Bitcoin was.
[02:55:11.957 --> 02:55:18.421]  He says, we don't have any privacy and don't deserve it, but then he makes his girlfriends wear Michael Jackson hoods over their heads.
[02:55:18.421 --> 02:55:21.163]  I mean, these guys are all crazy.
[02:55:21.163 --> 02:55:27.586]  I think in the final equation, they're really just crooks and they're not invincible.
[02:55:27.586 --> 02:55:28.747]  What does Max Keiser have to say?
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:32.321]  Well, just a couple of late-breaking things that are happening during the break here.
[02:55:32.321 --> 02:55:36.803]  First of all, you just said they banned the word mother and father.
[02:55:36.803 --> 02:55:37.903]  How do they do that?
[02:55:37.903 --> 02:55:39.204]  They use copyright law.
[02:55:39.204 --> 02:55:42.925]  They'll say, we own the word mother and father.
[02:55:42.925 --> 02:55:46.547]  That's the problem of perpetual copyright law.
[02:55:46.547 --> 02:55:48.988]  Now, you can't even use the word mother and father.
[02:55:48.988 --> 02:55:50.428]  They use copyright law.
[02:55:50.428 --> 02:55:53.590]  That's how they create the copyright apartheid.
[02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:58.712]  Isn't political correctness a type of copyright where they just want everything becomes racist?
[02:55:59.472 --> 02:56:00.913]  It's not about political correctness.
[02:56:00.913 --> 02:56:04.937]  They'll present it as being somehow politically motivated or ideologically motivated.
[02:56:04.937 --> 02:56:05.437]  No.
[02:56:05.437 --> 02:56:06.878]  It's about just they want to own it.
[02:56:06.878 --> 02:56:08.480]  They want to own the words.
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:11.042]  And then if you ever use the words, they want you to pay them.
[02:56:11.042 --> 02:56:13.184]  If you can't pay, they'll lend you the money.
[02:56:13.184 --> 02:56:14.305]  It's all economics.
[02:56:14.305 --> 02:56:15.826]  There's no ideology whatsoever.
[02:56:15.826 --> 02:56:18.869]  If everyone thinks it's ideologically driven, they're falling into the trap.
[02:56:18.869 --> 02:56:20.190]  It's just money, money, money.
[02:56:20.190 --> 02:56:22.692]  Now before we get off the air, I want to talk about what I want to talk about.
[02:56:23.112 --> 02:56:32.317]  Which is that, you know, I'm starting a new crowdfunding site called StartJoin, and this crowdfunding site is going to have a top-up fund.
[02:56:32.317 --> 02:56:50.907]  So the more people that like the page, because it doesn't actually start until December, but I'm going to be tracking the number of likes on the Facebook page associated with StartJoin, and as the number of likes goes up, I'm going to increase that fund, the top-up fund, which is going to be essentially money that I'm going to be giving away
[02:56:51.707 --> 02:56:51.827]  Yes.
[02:57:22.429 --> 02:57:27.361]  ...projects so it's important to have diversity out there with these crowdfunding systems.
[02:57:28.462 --> 02:57:29.603]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:57:29.603 --> 02:57:34.065]  And this is, as you know, goes to the technologies I've developed for 15 years.
[02:57:34.065 --> 02:57:36.666]  So we're going to bring some new things to the party.
[02:57:36.666 --> 02:57:41.189]  But right now, I'm just trying to get as many likes as possible on the Facebook Start Joining page.
[02:57:41.189 --> 02:57:49.173]  I think you might have it up on your screen right now as just a way to kick this thing off, which will be coming into beta in December.
[02:57:49.173 --> 02:57:54.156]  And the more likes I get, the bigger the fund, which means the more money I'm going to be giving away.
[02:57:54.156 --> 02:57:55.196]  Very interesting, Max.
[02:57:55.196 --> 02:57:55.737]  In closing,
[02:57:56.398 --> 02:58:00.111]  How bad is the hyperinflation going to get and when will we really see it start to get worse?
[02:58:01.638 --> 02:58:10.066]  Well, in hyperinflation or in any type of major inflation, you are referring to something called the velocity of money.
[02:58:10.066 --> 02:58:19.114]  Right now, all the money that's being printed by the Fed or other central banks just sits on the balance sheets of the banks and they use it amongst themselves to make quick gains amongst themselves.
[02:58:19.114 --> 02:58:21.115]  It doesn't enter the general economy.
[02:58:21.115 --> 02:58:27.201]  But once you have a big creditor, let's say China, decides that, you know what, we've got $4 trillion of these dollars sitting around.
[02:58:27.261 --> 02:58:28.001]  Do five more minutes.
[02:58:28.001 --> 02:58:28.642]  We're back in one minute.
[02:58:28.642 --> 02:58:36.646]  I want to finish up with that and then ask you about JPMorgan Chase announcing they're not going to let you take your money out of the country.
[02:58:36.646 --> 02:58:38.027]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:59:50.305 --> 02:59:55.128]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:59:55.128 --> 02:59:56.709]  You want answers?
[02:59:56.709 --> 02:59:58.250]  Well, so does he.
[02:59:58.250 --> 03:00:02.453]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:02.453 --> 03:00:06.555]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.555 --> 03:00:14.661]  I think it's totally reasonable Google's launching big NSA barges off the coast and putting up blimps with their loyalists.
[03:00:15.825 --> 03:00:19.388]  Yeah, there's new documents out admitting they know that cell phones give you brain cancer.
[03:00:19.388 --> 03:00:22.270]  Still deployed them, but they care about me.
[03:00:22.270 --> 03:00:37.261]  So I'm trying to do some FCC fairness doctrine, which the FCC is now moving forward to get all broadcasters to file on themselves and tattle on themselves on a law that isn't law yet to use it on you to fine and fee you and shut you down.
[03:00:37.261 --> 03:00:39.482]  So the persecution of the press is here.
[03:00:39.482 --> 03:00:40.003]  They've got their
[03:00:41.525 --> 03:00:47.689]  EAS takeover systems of media, everybody's getting emails and cell phone takeovers by, oh, vomit.
[03:00:47.689 --> 03:00:56.274]  So it's the authoritarian plunge, it's all up on Infowars.com and now DHS is buying automatic weapons that fire pepper spray at crowds.
[03:00:56.274 --> 03:01:01.297]  That ties into all their riot control preparations because it was all lined up before this happened.
[03:01:01.297 --> 03:01:04.599]  I mean, they are just blowing the economy on purpose because they love us.
[03:01:05.478 --> 03:01:11.443]  And if you don't like it, you know, it's worse than being racist.
[03:01:11.443 --> 03:01:13.204]  It's not trendy.
[03:01:13.204 --> 03:01:16.467]  So, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[03:01:16.467 --> 03:01:19.350]  Riley in Michigan, thank you for holding.
[03:01:19.350 --> 03:01:20.310]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:01:20.310 --> 03:01:22.752]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:01:22.752 --> 03:01:23.693]  Well, I'm a bad man.
[03:01:23.693 --> 03:01:26.576]  You sound pretty fired up today, man.
[03:01:26.576 --> 03:01:27.857]  I don't worship my leader.
[03:01:27.857 --> 03:01:31.440]  Hey man, I just had a quick question for you.
[03:01:32.583 --> 03:01:34.325]  I'm somebody who's like 27 years old.
[03:01:34.325 --> 03:01:36.366]  I got a great job.
[03:01:36.366 --> 03:01:48.096]  Um, unfortunately in light of this, in light of this Jamie Dimon situation, um, I just wanted to hear your thoughts on, uh, what you think about people who pay in to the system and pay student loans.
[03:01:48.096 --> 03:01:52.220]  I mean, I talk to my spouse with the dollars a year and you know, it's just something that I worry about.
[03:01:54.014 --> 03:01:57.415]  I'm trying to get away from paying corporate borg and I just don't know what to do.
[03:01:57.415 --> 03:02:01.156]  And I know you can't really give advice on stuff like that, but what would you do in someone's situation like that?
[03:02:01.156 --> 03:02:05.897]  Well, I mean, it's too complex and it's hard for me to figure out what to do myself, but here's a Fox News article.
[03:02:05.897 --> 03:02:11.038]  Detroit bankruptcy proposal would leave pensioners with 16 cents on the dollar.
[03:02:11.038 --> 03:02:14.359]  And by the time they're done with us, nobody's getting your pension.
[03:02:14.359 --> 03:02:16.199]  I told you, you'll get 10 to 20 percent.
[03:02:16.199 --> 03:02:18.060]  Nobody's going to get Social Security.
[03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:19.200]  You're going to get death paneled.
[03:02:20.031 --> 03:02:22.432]  And they've got actuaries, they've already done it in Northern Europe.
[03:02:22.432 --> 03:02:23.713]  This is the plan.
[03:02:23.713 --> 03:02:26.555]  The bankers want you poor.
[03:02:26.555 --> 03:02:30.077]  So, they're trying to create debtor prisons, they're trying to persecute people.
[03:02:30.077 --> 03:02:40.984]  I mean, I personally, if I had some big, you know, college degree thing, and most of them, you know, like 80-something percent of the time you could never even pay it off with the jobs you've got.
[03:02:41.949 --> 03:02:44.990]  It's all a giant fraud anyways.
[03:02:44.990 --> 03:02:49.732]  I would pay your debt back to a local bank or a local group or a family that loans you money.
[03:02:49.732 --> 03:02:51.993]  Everybody always cheats, though, with their family.
[03:02:51.993 --> 03:03:00.857]  If it was with a big bank or something, one of the big six narcotics trafficking banks, it's almost your duty, in my view, to not pay.
[03:03:00.857 --> 03:03:07.380]  And then, of course, you can later settle with them or do what all the big gangsters do, like
[03:03:09.631 --> 03:03:13.073]  Trump and people, they just declare bankruptcy over and over again.
[03:03:13.073 --> 03:03:15.054]  But of course, they'll go after you if you're small.
[03:03:15.054 --> 03:03:19.195]  They only let the billionaires engage in fraud through that.
[03:03:19.195 --> 03:03:22.897]  And I'm not even encouraging you to do that.
[03:03:22.897 --> 03:03:26.319]  Because the system is a wall of evil.
[03:03:26.319 --> 03:03:28.840]  And it's designed to wreck everything.
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:32.782]  And no one's ever set something up this purely evil.
[03:03:32.782 --> 03:03:35.203]  So all I know is the colleges are all a fraud.
[03:03:35.203 --> 03:03:35.923]  They're all a facade.
[03:03:35.923 --> 03:03:36.784]  They're all a big front.
[03:03:36.784 --> 03:03:37.324]  All the big ones.
[03:03:38.717 --> 03:04:03.516]  I mean take University of Texas is basically a crime syndicate that secretly owns like a third of the country and you know is involved in every shady deal you can imagine but they've got Bevo so it makes it okay it's all fake and they send out these things all their alumni saying give us your estate when you die so it can be laundered into offshore operations I mean these are mafia I mean it's just it's all a giant joke they've broken the social contract with us okay they are waging war on us so
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:14.243]  You know, I mean, I think you should pay more into Social Security, they should raise taxes, you should pay off all your fake debts, and just worship government.
[03:04:14.243 --> 03:04:19.325]  And then if they, you know, want to add a checkpoint, want to do a proctology exam, I think you should worship them and thank them.
[03:04:19.325 --> 03:04:20.906]  How's that sound?
[03:04:20.906 --> 03:04:21.706]  That sounds awful.
[03:04:22.307 --> 03:04:23.988]  No, I'm doing Fairness Doctrine.
[03:04:23.988 --> 03:04:26.048]  See, I just said I wouldn't pay it back or whatever.
[03:04:26.048 --> 03:04:27.669]  Especially if you can't pay it back.
[03:04:27.669 --> 03:04:28.409]  What's the point?
[03:04:28.409 --> 03:04:29.829]  It's like the interest go up and up and up.
[03:04:29.829 --> 03:04:31.850]  You gotta make them make a deal with you.
[03:04:31.850 --> 03:04:34.131]  Okay, but that's what Alex Jones would do.
[03:04:34.131 --> 03:04:36.491]  The FCC approves, though, that we do this now.
[03:04:36.491 --> 03:04:43.313]  Part of the Fairness Doctrine, ahead of it coming back in, is that, you know, I think you should just literally do whatever the government says and worship them.
[03:04:43.313 --> 03:04:44.134]  Romans 13.
[03:04:44.134 --> 03:04:44.774]  Worship government.
