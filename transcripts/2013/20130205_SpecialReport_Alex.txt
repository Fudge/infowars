[00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:12.817]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:19.460]  The day after the Super Bowl, the top story on Yahoo.com was, did Beyonce flash an Illuminati sign?
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:31.406]  Next to a picture of Beyonce making a pyramid hand symbol, the article goes on to say, according to legend, the Illuminati are a tiny super-secret cabal of influential individuals who have shaped the course of world events.
[00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:37.908]  So it makes perfect sense that Beyonce would flash their triangle sign to one of the largest viewing audiences in human history.
[00:00:38.408 --> 00:00:40.048]  What better way to preserve a secret?
[00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:42.009]  That's a definite possibility.
[00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:54.992]  Founded by Bavarian professor of law Adam Weishaupt in 1776, the Illuminati is considered the most notorious secret society, a sect bent on manipulating reality and dominating through a world government.
[00:00:55.692 --> 00:01:01.357]  These so-called illuminated ones have been referred to by some as Satan's elite, whom they worship.
[00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:10.525]  Their symbol is a pyramid to illustrate the idea of a top-down societal control system, and the pyramid features an all-seeing eye, or the eye of Lucifer.
[00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:21.094]  InfoWars has reported extensively on the history of the Illuminati, their birthplace, their prevalence in popular culture, music, movies, and their intent to dominate the world.
[00:01:21.634 --> 00:01:26.761]  While the article's language seems to sarcastically play off Beyonce's hand gesture, it's no big deal.
[00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:30.546]  This isn't the first time we've seen questionable symbolism at the Super Bowl.
[00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:37.294]  Look at these screenshots we got from last night's Super Bowl performance by Madonna, and then...
[00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:42.537]  You can also Google image search for yourself and type in Baphomet.
[00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:47.378]  And of course we see that Madonna is dressed up as Baphomet.
[00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:49.779]  She's sitting on the throne of Baphomet.
[00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.079]  She's got the horns.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.521]  Later on she's got the hand gestures of Baphomet.
[00:01:54.561 --> 00:02:00.303]  This is the idol that the American people during Super Bowl halftime show are being told to worship.
[00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:02.483]  So who's Baphomet?
[00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:07.425]  Baphomet is an idol used by Satanists to represent the devil.
[00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:11.733]  This also isn't the first time we've seen questionable symbolism from Beyonce.
[00:02:12.273 --> 00:02:23.195]  The pagan deity Baphomet, a figure revived in the 19th century as an idol for Satan worship, has been prominently featured in her videos and album artwork, and she even wears a Baphomet ring.
[00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:31.017]  And Beyonce isn't the only music star, by far, who's been called out for having hidden symbolism in her videos.
[00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:32.028]  The Yahoo!
[00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:35.672]  article claims that Beyonce is merely supporting her husband's record label.
[00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:42.679]  But if this symbol is a diamond and not a pyramid, why are he, Beyonce, and other stars seen looking through it with one eye?
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.424]  In addition, let's analyze this shirt sold under Jay-Z's clothing label.
[00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:51.449]  It again depicts the pyramid hand symbol with the all-seeing eye atop it.
[00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.890]  Jay-Z has also had some interesting critiques of hidden messages in his music as well.
[00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.130]  Jay-Z!
[00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.270]  H to the Izzo, V to the Izzay!
[00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.411]  J-Hova God, that's what he calls himself.
[00:02:58.571 --> 00:02:59.991]  We just happen to come across a very
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.472]  Disturbing song by Brother Jay-Z and has a backwards message in it and we have to reverse the song and play the song backwards.
[00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:40.113]  And the rapper has gone on record wondering why people have linked him to devil worship and the Illuminati.
[00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:51.846]  When asked by radio personality Angie Martinez if these rumors of deliberately adding images to his videos were true, Jay-Z responded, But here's a clip of another interview where Jay-Z actually admits he hides messages in his music.
[00:03:56.516 --> 00:04:04.682]  And then I start doing these different hidden messages in the music.
[00:04:04.923 --> 00:04:09.106]  That replaced the technical aspect of it.
[00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:12.068]  And then it just evolved from there.
[00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.352]  The Super Bowl aside, we've seen other curious eye symbolism at major events.
[00:04:17.933 --> 00:04:24.718]  At the one-year anniversary of 9-11, the band marched out onto Ground Zero in what appeared to be an all-seeing eye formation.
[00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:27.585]  Are all of these mere coincidences?
[00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:35.653]  Many people ask, if the Illuminati is such a super-secret cabal and they're so devious, why are they openly hiding their symbols in plain sight?
[00:04:36.013 --> 00:04:45.903]  In his book, Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, Michael Hoffman II calls this revelation of the method, or advertising one's power openly to amplify it.
[00:04:46.403 --> 00:04:51.046]  Gloating and flaunting the idea that resistance is futile before an unsuspecting public.
[00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:58.010]  Are all of these established Illuminati symbols supposed to acclimate people subconsciously to a darker agenda?
[00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.174]  Or are we really supposed to believe that all-seeing eyes and pyramids and Baphomet costumes are going to be the new theme for the Super Bowl every year?
[00:05:05.775 --> 00:05:10.778]  And what is the average person supposed to think about this continuous symbolism inundation?
[00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:16.813]  Or is the truth that they're not supposed to think at all, but just go along with their regularly scheduled programming?
[00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:21.474]  I mean, how many coincidences can you have before it's not a coincidence anymore?
[00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:33.478]  These are overt messages of elite domination by a covert group parading a pageant of mass conditioning before the public in a culture dominated by television at a sporting event watched by millions every year.
[00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:36.459]  And many do not even realize what's happening.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.880]  If it doesn't mean anything,
[00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:39.145]  Why is it there?
[00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:41.898]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm Melissa Melton.
