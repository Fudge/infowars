[00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:19.598]  A DoD public affairs meeting that made news on the Drudge Report and Infowars.com showed just how concerned the government is that they're losing the information war.
[00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.344]  They're no longer able to control information with just a handful of journalists now that we have alternative media and the internet.
[00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:28.466]  As one of the persons attending pointed out,
[00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:38.555]  The younger generations get it, that we have to start being honest and forthright, and it's difficult to convey those ideas and convince the chain of command.
[00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:46.022]  So we're putting out mindless propaganda, is what some of us feel that we're putting out, and what the American people feel that we're putting out.
[00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:47.183]  So how do we change this?
[00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:54.732]  Those inside the military and the government know that it's propaganda, but the government is still pushing ahead with its efforts in the InfoWar.
[00:00:55.052 --> 00:01:00.415]  In this breaking exclusive news from InfoWars, Social Security is looking to hire COINTEL agents.
[00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:14.508]  The job listing says the position is responsible for complex assignments to establish and maintain the Social Security Administration's defensive counterintelligence operations, collaboration, intelligence, and information sharing missions.
[00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:17.949]  Intelligence operations are not just about reconnaissance.
[00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:23.671]  They're also about control, about shaping public opinion through the information that they release.
[00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:25.232]  And with baby boomers retiring,
[00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.933]  A bankrupt government barring astronomical amounts?
[00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.675]  And a younger generation of workers who will be enslaved to pay for it?
[00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:37.417]  Government is going to have to work very hard to put a happy face on history's largest Ponzi scheme.
[00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:39.958]  So Social Security is hiring propagandists.
[00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:46.241]  And a prohibition against our own government using propaganda in America that goes back to the beginning of the Cold War.
[00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:48.922]  The Smith-Munt Act being repealed.
[00:01:50.183 --> 00:01:57.007]  And if it couldn't be more obvious, Washington is now touting a new kind of behavioral modification that they call nudging.
[00:01:57.347 --> 00:02:02.489]  Nudge is a term that was coined by Cass Sunstein in a 2008 book of the same name.
[00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.873]  It was put into place by the UK government in 2010 and now they are privatizing the program for profit.
[00:02:09.473 --> 00:02:11.114]  Fascism and propaganda.
[00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:13.575]  Big Brother meets Madison Avenue.
[00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:15.495]  And of course, this is nothing new.
[00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:18.616]  This has been going on since the days of Edward Bernays.
[00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:22.598]  What is new, however, they're no longer trying to hide what they do.
[00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:26.559]  They're losing the InfoWar, but they're going to step up their game.
[00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.060]  For InfoWars Nightly News, this is David Knight.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:39.583]  State of Mind, a documentary that's carried by InfoWarsStore.com, is a great way to understand the broad base of the attack and the various techniques that they use.
