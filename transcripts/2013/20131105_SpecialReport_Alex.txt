[00:00:00.202 --> 00:00:03.186]  Hi guys, we're here at the Million Mass March in Austin.
[00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.549]  Like I'm sure everyone's heard before, we were never meant to fear our governments.
[00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.891]  Our governments were meant to fear us.
[00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:13.177]  And the people no longer have any power in America, and we're losing it more and more every day.
[00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:20.085]  We're here to talk to people about the NSA spying on them, about the Monsanto protection bill.
[00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.091]  We're here to also talk about the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:29.912]  Here to talk about how our government's been lying to us and how the mainstream media is telling us nothing but a bunch of garbage.
[00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:36.113]  Investigators are studying a shadowy subculture which may have encouraged a disturbed young man.
[00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:42.595]  The TSA has a thankless job enforcing procedures we all tolerate through gritted teeth.
[00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:44.075]  A popular target.
[00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:45.216]  No kidding!
[00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:48.418]  Who else wants a job groping men, women, and children all day?
[00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:55.842]  Among some anti-government activists, the agency embodies a federal government that's too invasive, corrupt, and incompetent.
[00:00:56.162 --> 00:01:01.406]  I believe it was 1605, Guy Fawkes tried to blow up British Parliament, and he failed.
[00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:03.107]  He was hung, they caught him.
[00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:08.230]  But it's not the idea, I mean it's not the guy that we remember in particular, it's the idea that
[00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:15.691]  We can stand up to them that maybe we don't need them and you know we the people will only take so much until there's a tipping point.
[00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:29.320]  So the Guy Fawkes mask I guess ever so eloquently put by Batman is people don't wear the mask to protect themselves necessarily but also to protect the people that they love.
[00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:42.223]  InfoWars.com is proud to introduce the new InfoWars skateboards by Alien Workshop.
[00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:44.765]  Skaters have always been against the grain socially.
[00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:46.406]  Now wake up your friends politically.
[00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:48.327]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:01:48.627 --> 00:01:50.348]  We have Divide and Conquer or Brainwashing.
[00:01:50.828 --> 00:01:56.272]  Then take your deck to your local skate shop, pick out your own trucks, your own wheels, and then hit the streets and wake some people up.
[00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:58.453]  Here is legendary skateboarder Jake Nunn.
[00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:01.154]  This one has a lot more concave than I have on my board.
[00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:02.235]  And I like concave.
[00:02:02.595 --> 00:02:04.436]  It makes it easier to turn and feel the board.
[00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:05.697]  It's pretty cool.
[00:02:05.737 --> 00:02:07.138]  I mean, it's almost the same shape as mine.
[00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.767]  It's not really a sport, and it's not really art.
[00:02:10.368 --> 00:02:12.089]  It's just kind of freedom, you know?
[00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.591]  I've listened to Alex Jones for a long time, and I love what InfoWars does.
[00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:17.353]  I've always loved Alien Workshop, too.
[00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:19.054]  I think it's kind of cool you guys got together.
[00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:20.815]  This one's pretty nice.
[00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:24.137]  Definitely one for the wall, one for the collection.
[00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:25.658]  Also good to skate.
[00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.081]  Get these limited edition decks at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:31.422]  This is Jake Nunn.

[00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:36.606]  Alien Workshop collaboration.
