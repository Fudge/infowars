[00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.664]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:09.125]  You want answers?
[00:00:09.906 --> 00:00:10.807]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:15.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:19.717]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:38.012]  My friends, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:38.252 --> 00:00:40.216]  It is Wednesday, the 25th day of September.
[00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:55.002]  2013 and Congressman, Senator Ted Cruz is on track to have one of the longest filibusters in congressional and senatorial history.
[00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:58.184]  In fact, we're going to go to a live feed of him.
[00:00:58.245 --> 00:00:59.986]  He's set to wrap it up at noon eastern.
[00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:07.771]  It is noon eastern, one afternoon right now, so let's hear what could be the end because they're claiming under Senate rules they can shut him down now.
[00:01:08.272 --> 00:01:11.154]  I've got to say, folks, I really respect
[00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:12.814]  Senator Ted Cruz.
[00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:16.016]  I didn't know Senator Ted Cruz when he was running in Texas.
[00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:16.897]  We interviewed him once.
[00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:19.438]  I wish I would have gotten to know him better.
[00:01:20.138 --> 00:01:22.439]  I've known Rand Paul forever, so I absolutely endorse him.
[00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.540]  I know he's a great guy, and of course he's proving that.
[00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:26.101]  But Ted Cruz is really amazing.
[00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:27.642]  It's hard to talk for 20 plus hours.
[00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:35.086]  And I mean, my problem would be wanting to sit down and obviously wanting to use the bathroom.
[00:01:37.275 --> 00:01:38.276]  They're doing closing prayer.
[00:01:38.316 --> 00:01:38.936]  Let's go to it.
[00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:40.257]  Here's Senator Cruz.
[00:01:40.337 --> 00:01:42.998]  The righteous avail much.
[00:01:45.099 --> 00:02:00.146]  During this challenging season, give our senators the wisdom to make full and complete their commitment to serve the American people.
[00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:05.349]  Equip our lawmakers with the power
[00:02:06.348 --> 00:02:18.517]  To clearly discern right from wrong, so that integrity will govern their words and actions.
[00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:33.029]  Lord, make them this day sentinels on the walls of freedom, worthy of the power and responsibility they exercise.
[00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:47.145]  Guide and sustain them in the great unfinished task of achieving peace, justice, and understanding.
[00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:48.005]  21 hours, folks.
[00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.506]  Among all people.
[00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:50.366]  He just finished.
[00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:51.946]  It's being ended with a prayer.
[00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:55.587]  We pray in your great name.
[00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:58.054]  Oh, man.
[00:02:58.634 --> 00:03:01.455]  And again, obviously that's not Senator Ted Cruz.
[00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:03.796]  That's the chaplain of the Senate.
[00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:06.217]  Let's go back now to the feed.
[00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:07.478]  Oh, now Harry Reid jumps in.
[00:03:09.238 --> 00:03:14.460]  We all admire the senator from Texas for his wanting to talk.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.162]  Harry Reid is now the most unpopular politician in America, according to Gallup.
[00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:19.502]  I'm not sure we learned anything new.
[00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:22.743]  The things that he talked about have been talked about before.
[00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:25.444]  They're absolutely beside themselves.
[00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:26.865]  In fact, endlessly.
[00:03:28.203 --> 00:03:29.724]  But it's been interesting to watch.
[00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:38.530]  But, Mr. President, for lack of a better way of describing this, it has been a big waste of time.
[00:03:40.652 --> 00:03:44.254]  The government is set to shut down in a matter of hours.
[00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:46.155]  You're trying to shut America down, you little turd!
[00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:47.997]  The government will close.
[00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.159]  And it's a shame.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.140]  We're standing here.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.501]  There's Emperor Palpatine.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.881]  Perhaps two days.
[00:03:59.302 --> 00:03:59.902]  Awww.
[00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:05.106]  Trying to force a defunding of an unconstitutional bill that 77% of Americans hate?
[00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:08.828]  We need to pass very quickly and send it back to the House of Representatives.
[00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:14.532]  They're waiting for us to act.
[00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:17.194]  This is where he acts like Cruz is being obstructionist.
[00:04:17.987 --> 00:04:24.094]  When he's only trying to make them repeal a bill that's totally evil and totally unpopular.
[00:04:24.114 --> 00:04:25.696]  Your criminal actions?
[00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.553]  That what we have here... Alright folks, we have it taped.
[00:04:38.573 --> 00:04:43.536]  We're going to come back and play the last five minutes of Ted Cruz's speech and some of the highlights and then all the other big news.
[00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:45.538]  It is just crazy what's going on.
[00:04:45.558 --> 00:04:52.764]  We obviously covered yesterday 19 to 17 percent approval rating for government, trust in government, Gallup poll.
[00:04:53.324 --> 00:04:54.345]  I think it's lower than that.
[00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:57.467]  I'm telling you, there is a collapse in confidence in these shysters.
[00:04:57.487 --> 00:04:57.968]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.127 --> 00:05:04.028]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:07.909]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.330]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.690]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:21.332]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:05:21.932 --> 00:05:25.373]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:05:26.013 --> 00:05:36.723]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:05:37.424 --> 00:05:42.429]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.355]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,
[00:05:48.655 --> 00:05:50.797]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[00:06:08.392 --> 00:06:14.777]  Listen, there was some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:18.499]  They're the good guys.

[00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:13.333]  It's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:17.237]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not
[00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:19.153]  Increase our debt.
[00:08:19.714 --> 00:08:22.735]  It does not somehow promote profitability.
[00:08:23.055 --> 00:08:31.759]  All it does is it says you gotta pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:35.821]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:43.075 --> 00:08:47.858]  Ladies and gentlemen, do you know what you're seeing right now in the U.S.
[00:08:47.938 --> 00:08:51.580]  Senate and in the 50 states of our once great republic?
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.483]  You're seeing the ghost of the republic rise again.
[00:08:55.503 --> 00:09:04.949]  The question is, will it fully reconstitute itself and will the republic like the phoenix rising from the ashes be reborn?
[00:09:06.027 --> 00:09:20.041]  And will it be reborn in the fire of counter-revolution against the globalists who are revolutionaries and who have seized the central government and are waging war against the final foundations of the republic?
[00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:29.651]  Because if they can fully destroy those foundations, it is those foundations that made this country great from which the spirit of liberty may rise again.
[00:09:31.087 --> 00:09:33.408]  You saw the big Gallup poll out yesterday.
[00:09:33.928 --> 00:09:42.732]  As low as 17, the average was 19%, across the board, confidence and trust in government.
[00:09:45.393 --> 00:09:47.895]  Congress has a 10% approval rating.
[00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:57.339]  The lowest approval rating in Congress is in the Senate for the man known as Harry Reid.
[00:10:01.087 --> 00:10:08.051]  The Catholic Church is moving to basically excommunicator, not give communion to Nancy Pelosi for promoting partial birth abortion.
[00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:16.615]  I mean, that's just another example of all over the place, different groups, organizations are getting on the offense against evil.
[00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:20.718]  If you won't stand up for children, you won't stand up for anybody.
[00:10:21.238 --> 00:10:22.859]  It's just that simple.
[00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:27.839]  But that's another issue I'm going to be getting into later in the broadcast today.
[00:10:28.319 --> 00:10:37.342]  Senator Ted Cruz, hailing from Texas, so proud that he's from Texas, so proud that I didn't know him, so I didn't trust him.
[00:10:37.382 --> 00:10:44.285]  Didn't say I thought he was a bad guy, said I thought he was a lot better than the snake that he was running against.
[00:10:45.306 --> 00:10:47.787]  David Dewhurst, who we know is mooey bad.
[00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:54.370]  And so we supported him, but held our nose and did it because of some of the CFR connections via his wife.
[00:10:55.232 --> 00:11:00.981]  We have really seen Senator Ted Cruz prove that he's following every promise he gave.
[00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:03.705]  He's right up there with Rand Paul now, in my mind.
[00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:14.345]  And it takes a real man to be able to talk 21 hours standing up, not going to the bathroom, not sitting down, and staying very eloquent throughout.
[00:11:15.066 --> 00:11:18.309]  As you can tell, he was really struggling towards the end.
[00:11:18.329 --> 00:11:19.149]  21 hours.
[00:11:21.693 --> 00:11:48.794]  And he eloquently, I mean I couldn't sleep and woke up at like four o'clock in the morning was watching it on the computer and I worked till midnight last night on the Obama deception and then went home and couldn't sleep and watched it and he was just speaking from the heart and eloquent and then the Democratic senators were there just sniping and attacking and lying and the Republican leadership has been criticizing Cruz and a lot of Republican senators didn't support him
[00:11:49.778 --> 00:12:03.366]  Because they're owned by the same offshore banks that own the insurance companies that wrote Obamacare, Scamacare, Fraudcare, Double Your Premium Care, or more, designed to implode the country.
[00:12:04.887 --> 00:12:07.668]  Because then they will preside over the implosion.
[00:12:08.869 --> 00:12:12.671]  They're the big megabanks and corporations that are exempt from everything.
[00:12:13.111 --> 00:12:13.852]  It's so simple.
[00:12:14.072 --> 00:12:15.493]  They shut everybody off but them.
[00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:30.707]  That's why I talk about Warren Buffett lobbying for Obamacare, lobbying for tax increases on what he called rich people, folks making $30,000 a year or more, when he's exempt from everything because he's an insider.
[00:12:30.847 --> 00:12:34.770]  On record he's exempt, and the biggest recipient of the banker bailout.
[00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:38.052]  Personally, and his company.
[00:12:40.334 --> 00:12:45.758]  I start mentioning that and I literally go into a controlled rage because this is a criminal
[00:12:47.611 --> 00:12:58.855]  And he's one of the guys over Obama, and it's so obvious to anyone that knows about history, economics, anything, and the public still doesn't understand even one micron.
[00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:11.580]  But the public does know enough now that Gallup, as low as 17% trust in government, the average of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, you know how they ask the questions, is 19%.
[00:13:16.067 --> 00:13:19.209]  You want to know why they like to stage terror attacks, folks, or let terrorists attack us?
[00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:27.733]  The highest it's been in modern history was on 9-11.
[00:13:28.653 --> 00:13:29.414]  Sixty percent.
[00:13:32.335 --> 00:13:42.821]  Now it's nineteen and falling the New World Order with their little crown, their little
[00:13:43.837 --> 00:13:47.919]  Their little control freak is going down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:48.739 --> 00:13:49.419]  Going down.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.341]  Falling fast.
[00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:55.982]  And their attitude is a helter-skelter attitude.
[00:13:56.082 --> 00:14:01.084]  They say, hey, we're coming down fast, but we're miles above you.
[00:14:02.084 --> 00:14:05.165]  And that is the spirit of evil right there that we're talking about.
[00:14:09.287 --> 00:14:09.647]  In that
[00:14:12.557 --> 00:14:16.760]  They don't care if everything's wrecked and destroyed, as long as they're on top of it.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.184]  They'd rather rule in hell than serve in heaven.
[00:14:24.145 --> 00:14:26.467]  They think it's better to burn out than fade away.
[00:14:28.288 --> 00:14:30.990]  When the truth is, you don't fade away when you do the right thing.
[00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:41.097]  Humanity continues and gets better, and you care about other people, and you care about their future, and you care about the continuum of human struggle, not about the
[00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:47.077]  Psychopathic instinct to dominate everything that's more beautiful or more intelligent than you.
[00:14:50.417 --> 00:15:14.547]  A diseased, hyper-competitive, gang metastasization where gangs get control and rule by brute force and fraud instead of ruling by virtue and ruling by beauty and ruling by honor and ruling by strength and ruling by example and development and architecture.
[00:15:19.124 --> 00:15:24.651]  When I look at young innocent children and see the disease and the shade of
[00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:29.881]  I mean, it's a Twilight Zone episode to go outside my office and to go out there and see what's happening in this world.
[00:16:00.954 --> 00:16:08.679]  And to just witness how unconscious people are that serve the system and believe in it.
[00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:17.465]  But, it's less than 20% any way you slice it now, buy it, and that's what I've been telling you before all these polls came out.
[00:16:17.725 --> 00:16:20.007]  And I'm not saying that to go, oh I'm smart, listen to me.
[00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:23.509]  I'm saying that to explain to people, I know what I'm talking about, okay?
[00:16:23.529 --> 00:16:24.330]  I've studied history.
[00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:36.816]  I've studied trends, I've read the Globalist on publications, I am more dedicated and more focused than most people that are politically active and involved, and I know what I'm talking about.
[00:16:38.377 --> 00:16:51.483]  And even though I get up here and talk about a lot of really hardcore things on air, I'm only telling you this information because it's the truth,
[00:16:53.683 --> 00:17:07.737]  And I'm only telling you this information because only facing the full truth is going to allow us to turn this civilization around.
[00:17:09.379 --> 00:17:11.020]  The good news here
[00:17:12.495 --> 00:17:14.056]  is that there is a mass awakening.
[00:17:14.136 --> 00:17:14.956]  People are awake.
[00:17:15.036 --> 00:17:25.940]  But just because you hear a wreck outside your house or you hear fire engines outside your house and you wake up, it doesn't mean you've opened the window up and ascertained exactly what's happening yet.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:40.445]  So America is awake sitting up in the bed, rubbing the sleep out of their eyes, getting the glass of water off the table, putting our collective hand on our lower back and trying to get the crick out of it.
[00:17:42.244 --> 00:17:45.767]  Man, we need to leap up and run and open the window and see what's happening.
[00:17:45.787 --> 00:17:55.596]  I already went, opened the window, went outside 20-something years ago, found out what was happening, and I've been banging on people's doors going, man, there's World War III going on out here.
[00:17:55.856 --> 00:17:56.897]  How can you not hear this?
[00:17:56.957 --> 00:17:57.978]  How can you not be awake?
[00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:59.480]  How can you not be involved?
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.981]  Look at the treason.
[00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:02.102]  Look at the corruption.
[00:18:02.142 --> 00:18:03.604]  Look at the classical tyranny.
[00:18:04.204 --> 00:18:05.725]  The authoritarianism growing.
[00:18:05.745 --> 00:18:06.685]  We're all in danger.
[00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:15.030]  And now, finally, people are really, really awake, but they still are trying to figure out exactly what's going on.
[00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.851]  And we know what's going on.
[00:18:19.112 --> 00:18:24.495]  And it's so deep and so nasty that one has to really
[00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:26.671]  Marvel at it.
[00:18:27.412 --> 00:18:29.352]  But you don't want to get caught like a deer in the headlights.
[00:18:29.972 --> 00:18:36.214]  The good news is, we've been the frontline shock troops here at InfoWars.com.
[00:18:37.455 --> 00:18:47.718]  Our listeners have been the shock troops being made fun of, being attacked, being demonized, as the system desperately said we were terrorists and racist and dangerous and don't listen to us and we're behind terrorism.
[00:18:48.798 --> 00:18:55.060]  You've seen it, you've read it, because the globalists don't even want their own minions.
[00:18:57.483 --> 00:18:58.443]  Listening to us.
[00:19:00.504 --> 00:19:08.847]  Because their own minions are compartmentalized, and they listen to this show, they know what I'm talking about's real, because they're intelligent, but they've been compartmentalized.
[00:19:09.387 --> 00:19:13.909]  And they realize, oh, this is really the big picture, and they see what sitting ducks they are.
[00:19:14.884 --> 00:19:17.306]  And how there's no future and they're starting to look at their kids.
[00:19:17.566 --> 00:19:19.247]  They're starting to look at their nephews and nieces.
[00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:20.708]  They're starting to look at their family.
[00:19:20.889 --> 00:19:22.370]  They're starting to look at themselves.
[00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:28.935]  And realizing this deal with the devil is not going to end at a good place.
[00:19:33.157 --> 00:19:35.939]  So, the world is at the crossroads.
[00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:36.660]  We've now entered it.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.721]  I've told you we've been approaching it.
[00:19:39.141 --> 00:19:42.924]  We've now entered the crossroads, the event horizon.
[00:19:43.384 --> 00:19:45.146]  It's just gonna get crazier from here.
[00:19:45.526 --> 00:19:47.267]  You're gonna see incredibly good things happen.
[00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:49.329]  You're gonna see incredibly bad things happen.
[00:19:49.629 --> 00:19:51.030]  You're gonna see the best and worst.
[00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:52.571]  It's the best of times.
[00:19:53.031 --> 00:19:54.132]  It's the worst of times.
[00:19:54.772 --> 00:19:56.654]  And it's all coming up live, straight ahead.
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.100]  So, you've decided to get prepared.
[00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:07.342]  You're not sure that a case of ramen and a couple of granola bars under your bed will cut it as long-term food storage anymore.
[00:20:07.502 --> 00:20:08.162]  You're in luck!
[00:20:08.322 --> 00:20:11.723]  At Emergency Essentials, we have all the resources to get you started.

[00:20:28.826 --> 00:20:29.846]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:29.926 --> 00:20:34.248]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:34.408 --> 00:20:40.050]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.231]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[00:20:42.291 --> 00:20:43.472]  No word about IRAs.
[00:20:43.712 --> 00:20:46.273]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:21:05.522 --> 00:21:06.063]  Please!
[00:21:06.343 --> 00:21:09.648]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:21:09.928 --> 00:21:16.017]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:21:16.297 --> 00:21:18.639]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:21:57.742 --> 00:21:59.843]  Turn your food waste into fertilizer.
[00:22:00.003 --> 00:22:00.544]  That's right.

[00:22:21.696 --> 00:22:25.599]  Finally, a way to recycle all of your food waste safely and effectively.

[00:22:53.838 --> 00:22:59.421]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[00:22:59.782 --> 00:23:12.768]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[00:23:13.849 --> 00:23:15.530]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.931]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[00:23:17.971 --> 00:23:24.054]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:32.319]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:23:32.959 --> 00:23:38.442]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:23:38.662 --> 00:23:45.526]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:23:45.546 --> 00:23:45.946]  That's 877-532-5388.
[00:23:46.006 --> 00:23:46.967]  Or go to faketv.com.
[00:23:47.107 --> 00:23:48.768]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:04.834]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:05.514 --> 00:24:07.735]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:09.316 --> 00:24:23.283]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is going to be joining us again with the incredible information documenting the fact that Obama is arming Al-Qaeda worldwide and is connected to groups that attacked a Nairobi mall there in Kenya.
[00:24:24.952 --> 00:24:32.361]  We criticize the Saudi Arabian government offering and being on record already paying for the Al-Qaeda forces all over the Middle East, North Africa.
[00:24:33.402 --> 00:24:36.125]  And I predicted that they would try to censor that video.
[00:24:36.205 --> 00:24:40.990]  It's titled, Breaking Obama's Link to Kenyan Mall Massacre Revealed.
[00:24:42.052 --> 00:24:45.596]  And it says the following content has been identified by YouTube community.
[00:24:46.872 --> 00:24:53.957]  Yeah, just like if the community identifies a Fox sportscaster for not being for same-sex marriage, he was fired.
[00:24:54.558 --> 00:24:57.900]  Again, this is the new fascism, the new authoritarianism.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.664]  The following content has been identified by the YouTube community as being potentially offensive or graphic.
[00:25:03.724 --> 00:25:04.545]  By the way, it's not.
[00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:05.706]  Paul Watson's doing an article.
[00:25:06.126 --> 00:25:07.407]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[00:25:07.827 --> 00:25:13.792]  On my smartphone, my little spy phone, my little globalist imperial probe droid that I carry along with me,
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.242]  Keep your friends close, your enemies closer.
[00:25:17.262 --> 00:25:20.206]  It doesn't even let me watch it.
[00:25:20.306 --> 00:25:21.608]  I have screenshots of that.
[00:25:22.309 --> 00:25:27.296]  But here you can continue on to see the evil flagged info.
[00:25:28.337 --> 00:25:31.401]  And it's got trolls in there threatening to kill us.
[00:25:32.242 --> 00:25:33.643]  I guess they turned off comments.
[00:25:33.663 --> 00:25:34.784]  I've never seen Dave do that.
[00:25:35.204 --> 00:25:36.225]  I don't ever turn off comments.
[00:25:36.265 --> 00:25:38.306]  I let them just run wild.
[00:25:38.326 --> 00:25:41.688]  I don't ever see Dave that posts the videos on that channel.
[00:25:41.748 --> 00:25:43.029]  Used to be a volunteer channel, actually.
[00:25:43.069 --> 00:25:43.630]  Closed comments.
[00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:44.850]  Call Dave.
[00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.831]  Tell him to open them back up.
[00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:49.473]  I mean, let the trolls call for killing me and everything.
[00:25:50.274 --> 00:25:50.674]  Whatever.
[00:25:51.555 --> 00:25:54.337]  The Valkyries only smile on those who do not fear death.
[00:25:55.337 --> 00:25:56.258]  Old Norse saying.
[00:25:57.499 --> 00:25:58.900]  There's another old Norse saying.
[00:26:00.134 --> 00:26:03.176]  Cattle die, and kinsmen die.
[00:26:04.157 --> 00:26:09.801]  But I know there's one thing that never dies, and that's the fame of a dead man's deeds.
[00:26:10.721 --> 00:26:15.885]  But continuing, my friends, as I said to the crew this morning, you have to own death.
[00:26:16.877 --> 00:26:18.138]  Until you don't fear it anymore.
[00:26:18.178 --> 00:26:19.399]  She's like in V for Vendetta.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:28.247]  Whenever he's put her in the mock concentration camp, which is actually one of the old concentration camps, and then she says, go ahead, execute me.
[00:26:28.267 --> 00:26:29.307]  I'm not going to turn in my friends.
[00:26:29.327 --> 00:26:30.709]  And he goes, you're free now.
[00:26:30.749 --> 00:26:31.569]  You have no more fear.
[00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.553]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:26:36.633 --> 00:26:40.837]  And if we have that attitude, that attitude of victory, nothing can stand against us.
[00:26:40.897 --> 00:26:42.518]  If God be with us, who can stand against us?
[00:26:42.979 --> 00:26:44.100]  The globalists are scared.
[00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:46.177]  Harry Reid's scared.
[00:26:46.217 --> 00:26:47.037]  Obama's scared.
[00:26:47.077 --> 00:26:47.978]  The Clintons are scared.
[00:26:48.198 --> 00:26:49.278]  Benghazi's coming out.
[00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:51.740]  We had a whistleblower on yesterday.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.482]  And Kit Daniels is doing a story on this.
[00:26:55.822 --> 00:26:57.744]  It should have already been national news all over the country.
[00:26:57.784 --> 00:27:01.826]  He's a famous whistleblower from Iran-Contra and before that the Church Committee hearings.
[00:27:02.647 --> 00:27:04.708]  And still flies arms for the CIA.
[00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:06.289]  He was in an airbase doing it yesterday.
[00:27:07.642 --> 00:27:16.929]  And he said he talked to a high-level NATO official, Tosh Plumlee, and that it was State Department shipping arms to there, not just giving him Qaddafi arms.
[00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:31.600]  And concurring with the analysis I had from Pentagon sources that are scared to come on air, that he was ordered to be killed because of communiques where the State Department, the ambassador, was saying this is a bad idea.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.923]  Just like the Joint Chiefs of Staff have said it's a bad idea on record to arm al-Qaeda.
[00:27:37.216 --> 00:27:38.437]  That was a hit, folks.
[00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.179]  And the military's listening.
[00:27:41.219 --> 00:27:41.859]  They know that.
[00:27:41.979 --> 00:27:43.280]  And we had Tosh Plumlee on.
[00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:46.683]  This isn't rumors that it was an arms deal.
[00:27:46.903 --> 00:27:47.844]  We know there were arms there now.
[00:27:48.737 --> 00:27:57.302]  We told you that a week after it happened and nine months after, you know, it's not been a year plus, but nine months after Mainstream News reported exactly what we said.
[00:27:57.742 --> 00:28:01.044]  My point is we don't get up here and make stuff up.
[00:28:01.725 --> 00:28:08.709]  If we have a high-level source that nukes came out of mothballs out at Dyess Air Force Base and disappeared to the East Coast, it happened.
[00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:16.514]  If we tell you that the Navy SEAL families think their sons were murdered two years ago, we told you that two years ago?
[00:28:17.756 --> 00:28:19.219]  With the whole fake Bin Laden announcement?
[00:28:19.821 --> 00:28:26.295]  And then now they're all over the news saying exactly what I said, and saying day one that's what... I mean, we don't make this stuff up!
[00:28:28.396 --> 00:28:35.862]  And I just want you to understand, when you're watching and listening to this show, this is the most cutting-edge, wild liberty transmission out there.
[00:28:36.222 --> 00:28:39.004]  Committed, not compromising, not playing both sides.
[00:28:39.304 --> 00:28:42.167]  Hammer down, fly in the trench of the Death Star, folks.
[00:28:42.447 --> 00:28:43.788]  This is not a game, okay?
[00:28:44.408 --> 00:28:45.269]  We're under attack.
[00:28:45.309 --> 00:28:47.551]  We have guests that get killed on a routine basis.
[00:28:47.891 --> 00:28:48.712]  DC Madam.
[00:28:49.532 --> 00:28:50.713]  The list goes on and on.
[00:28:51.093 --> 00:28:52.094]  Gary Webb.
[00:28:52.114 --> 00:28:53.555]  You see other journalists being whacked.
[00:28:53.595 --> 00:28:54.056]  Hastings.
[00:28:54.556 --> 00:28:55.717]  This is not a game.
[00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:57.799]  And I'm not trying to freak people out out there.
[00:28:58.439 --> 00:29:02.563]  I just want you to know, you're listening to a transmission that's all in.
[00:29:02.923 --> 00:29:04.724]  Just like Ted Cruz is all in.
[00:29:06.045 --> 00:29:07.887]  Just like Rand Paul and Ron Paul are all in.
[00:29:08.708 --> 00:29:13.712]  Coming out saying, looks like it's staged terror attacks, we're working with Al Qaeda, looks like Al Qaeda staged this.
[00:29:13.772 --> 00:29:18.656]  Pat Buchanan, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Michael Savage all coming out.
[00:29:18.896 --> 00:29:21.198]  Now Hannity, I was watching him last night, sounds like me.
[00:29:21.919 --> 00:29:23.460]  We are moving the agenda.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.060]  We are taking control.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.181]  To use another Norse analogy, Beowulf has the arm of Grendel.
[00:29:29.481 --> 00:29:33.542]  That's the spirit of America reawakening that can pull a thousand Grendel arms out.
[00:29:33.943 --> 00:29:38.824]  We have it, and Grendel's now scared as he feels the arm being leveraged to be torn out.
[00:29:39.544 --> 00:29:47.606]  And Grendel's very dangerous right now, but all we gotta do is decide to tear his arm out, and his arm will tear free, and he will crawl back to Mama.
[00:29:48.046 --> 00:29:48.946]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.446 --> 00:29:50.947]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.974 --> 00:29:54.816]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.199 --> 00:30:04.062]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.971]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:11.393]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:30:11.933 --> 00:30:14.774]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:30:15.394 --> 00:30:21.416]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:30:22.017 --> 00:30:25.458]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:30:26.098 --> 00:30:36.780]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:30:37.501 --> 00:30:42.482]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:30:42.982 --> 00:30:48.403]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,
[00:30:48.703 --> 00:30:50.844]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[00:30:51.105 --> 00:30:53.326]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com.

[00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:03.373]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:31:03.513 --> 00:31:06.495]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:31:06.635 --> 00:31:11.878]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:31:12.199 --> 00:31:13.840]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.421]  We are what we eat.
[00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:20.083]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:31:20.423 --> 00:31:24.405]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[00:31:24.645 --> 00:31:26.966]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:31:27.206 --> 00:31:33.129]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:32:04.254 --> 00:32:08.655]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:32:08.775 --> 00:32:14.777]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:32:14.897 --> 00:32:25.679]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:32:25.879 --> 00:32:32.180]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.

[00:32:47.324 --> 00:32:49.347]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[00:33:16.147 --> 00:33:22.210]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.171]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.693 --> 00:33:30.293]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:30.313 --> 00:33:30.874]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:30.954 --> 00:33:31.954]  Central Time.
[00:33:32.034 --> 00:33:34.775]  We're here live, back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central.
[00:33:35.215 --> 00:33:36.916]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:37.737 --> 00:33:44.399]  I want to open the phones up specifically for callers to give us your take on Ted Cruz's historical 21-hour
[00:33:45.967 --> 00:33:46.587]  Filibuster.
[00:33:47.288 --> 00:33:56.632]  And then we've got a Central Florida chairman of Veterans for Peace, which is a good anti-war group.
[00:33:57.433 --> 00:33:59.334]  I've known Don Darling and others.
[00:33:59.374 --> 00:34:02.135]  He was a submarine, nuclear submarine commander here in Austin.
[00:34:02.155 --> 00:34:02.695]  I got to know him.
[00:34:02.736 --> 00:34:03.656]  He's been a guest many times.
[00:34:04.216 --> 00:34:10.019]  We should work on getting him back on, exposing the whole police state situation and what the military's been turned into.
[00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:12.901]  But Veterans for Peace at the grassroots has been trying
[00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:22.645]  From a left perspective, but not even really left, just an anti-war constitution perspective, to impeach Obama, but the head of Veterans for Peace has been blocking it.
[00:34:23.105 --> 00:34:30.288]  So at the bottom of the next hour, we're going to have folks from Veterans for Peace come on air and expose what's going on.
[00:34:31.573 --> 00:34:40.639]  Just as Ted Cruz went after the Republican leadership for helping write Obamacare and for helping to get it passed and for being traitorous against the Constitution.
[00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:53.127]  That's how you could take over the Republican Party with libertarian constitutionalists, manned by people like Bongino, running for Congress up in the 6th District of Maryland, and so many others.
[00:34:53.968 --> 00:34:57.771]  There are hundreds of people running for federal positions.
[00:34:58.231 --> 00:35:01.273]  There are thousands running for state positions and winning all over the place.
[00:35:01.956 --> 00:35:04.250]  And imagine if we hadn't gotten behind Rand Paul.
[00:35:05.506 --> 00:35:06.767]  Four years ago or three years ago.
[00:35:07.307 --> 00:35:10.429]  Imagine if we hadn't gotten behind Ted Cruz a couple years ago.
[00:35:10.889 --> 00:35:12.590]  Imagine if we wouldn't have done that.
[00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:20.514]  If we hadn't gotten behind Ron Paul, the libertarian option to crony capitalism and corruption would not be out there.
[00:35:20.834 --> 00:35:27.057]  It's key during this collapse to point out who did it, who was behind it, so that we don't get the blame.
[00:35:27.377 --> 00:35:30.759]  They're trying to blame capitalism and free market on what's happened.
[00:35:31.099 --> 00:35:32.420]  History is replete.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.601]  Capitalism
[00:35:35.011 --> 00:35:43.256]  And a real free market creates oceans of jobs, oceans of upward mobility, just cornucopias of wealth.
[00:35:43.677 --> 00:35:45.558]  The problem is it then produces decadence.
[00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:49.020]  That's the only bad byproduct.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.043]  And then people become decadent, then they become debtors, they become scammers, and things collapse.
[00:35:54.263 --> 00:35:56.184]  There is a problem with freedom.
[00:35:56.504 --> 00:36:01.888]  It creates such wealth that even a small government can skim
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.483]  Tons of money off the top of infrastructure and then grows into a monster.
[00:36:07.725 --> 00:36:18.595]  See, government knows if it cut taxes, like Kennedy cut taxes by 50% in one bracket, 30% in the other brackets, and tax receipts, you can look this up, doubled in one year.
[00:36:18.935 --> 00:36:19.616]  Doubled!
[00:36:20.197 --> 00:36:22.159]  Government doesn't want double tax receipts.
[00:36:23.277 --> 00:36:26.878]  The big banks and insiders running things, they're all exempt.
[00:36:27.598 --> 00:36:30.159]  Totally exempt in most cases, or partially exempt.
[00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:33.260]  With the loopholes, the set-asides, all of it.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.840]  That's on record.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.701]  They write the tax code.
[00:36:36.101 --> 00:36:38.121]  So they want their competition shut down.
[00:36:38.241 --> 00:36:39.402]  I cannot say that enough.
[00:36:39.682 --> 00:36:46.384]  And I'm telling you, I was talking about this 18 years ago, and only the John Birch Society was talking about it then, and Ron Paul.
[00:36:48.001 --> 00:36:54.886]  Now I can tune in to C-SPAN during debates and hear the few good senators talking just like their more eloquent Alex Joneses.
[00:36:55.066 --> 00:36:55.767]  I can tune in.
[00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.668]  Limbaugh is forced to join us now.
[00:36:58.369 --> 00:37:01.711]  Glenn Beck sounds like an Alex Jones clone now on 90% of what he does.
[00:37:02.292 --> 00:37:02.732]  I'm happy!
[00:37:04.661 --> 00:37:05.242]  It's wonderful.
[00:37:06.222 --> 00:37:07.803]  I just want to beat the new world order.
[00:37:08.144 --> 00:37:09.965]  I don't want to see socialism take over.
[00:37:10.205 --> 00:37:11.786]  I don't want to see the family broken up.
[00:37:12.226 --> 00:37:13.847]  I don't want to see our guns taken.
[00:37:14.107 --> 00:37:18.570]  I don't want to see more agenda 21 where they shut down all their competition completely.
[00:37:19.931 --> 00:37:23.333]  With small businesses absolutely hammered under taxes.
[00:37:23.913 --> 00:37:28.977]  I mean, listen, I thought I could expand because we pay all the unconstitutional taxes because we have to keep our nose completely clean.
[00:37:29.983 --> 00:37:30.283]  I don't know.
[00:37:53.257 --> 00:37:54.677]  I'm actually paying negative out.
[00:37:55.478 --> 00:37:57.598]  I've gone to tax lawyers, you name it, and they go, no, no, no.
[00:37:58.098 --> 00:37:59.899]  You got to go to the feds and try to get a waiver.
[00:37:59.939 --> 00:38:01.339]  You got to go give money to politicians.
[00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:04.740]  If you spend $100,000, you'll get all these waivers.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:09.121]  I'd have to hire all these lawyers and spend millions of dollars, then I'd be basically tax exempt.
[00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:12.002]  I mean, this country is nuts.
[00:38:12.982 --> 00:38:14.863]  It is crazy, folks.
[00:38:15.868 --> 00:38:20.810]  Just like France has over 100% tax on middle class, people go, you're lying.
[00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:21.650]  No, that's Reuters.
[00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:22.731]  That's AP.
[00:38:23.051 --> 00:38:23.791]  That's Forbes.
[00:38:24.251 --> 00:38:25.692]  A 105% tax.
[00:38:25.812 --> 00:38:30.534]  In fact, I always keep saying 100% and that's incorrect.
[00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:33.975]  See, I tend to downgrade things because I can't believe it myself.
[00:38:34.436 --> 00:38:35.216]  It's 105%.
[00:38:37.217 --> 00:38:38.277]  There's the headline.
[00:38:38.317 --> 00:38:40.058]  French tax soars over 100 to 105%.
[00:38:49.042 --> 00:38:50.484]  And you're like, how do they do that?
[00:38:50.624 --> 00:38:52.247]  Because they're destroying people!
[00:38:52.968 --> 00:39:00.298]  The entire socialist class is tax-exempt and has Swiss bank accounts and it came out a year ago and no one got in trouble.
[00:39:01.971 --> 00:39:07.754]  There are French bureaucrats who have jobs making 300,000 euros a year.
[00:39:08.294 --> 00:39:09.314]  That's tax exempt.
[00:39:09.334 --> 00:39:11.075]  They actually have exemptions, like Obamacare.
[00:39:11.335 --> 00:39:12.736]  They're exempt from taxes.
[00:39:12.776 --> 00:39:13.896]  The EU bureaucrats are exempt.
[00:39:13.916 --> 00:39:19.099]  And then they go, well, why does this politician have a billion dollars or a billion euros in a Swiss account?
[00:39:19.159 --> 00:39:20.199]  And no one gets in trouble.
[00:39:20.619 --> 00:39:26.542]  It's just like the Attorney General with Lois Lerner going after the Tea Party, perjuring in Congress.
[00:39:26.942 --> 00:39:28.503]  She's not going to get in trouble.
[00:39:29.878 --> 00:39:35.725]  She's estimated to get over $2 million if she just lives another 10 years in her pension of taxpayer money.
[00:39:36.466 --> 00:39:40.430]  She's going to get $2 million.
[00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:48.460]  $2 million, bare minimum, for committing crimes and persecuting people like the Soviet Union.
[00:39:50.538 --> 00:39:54.321]  I want to give out the number, I want to get your take on Ted Cruz's speech and play some clips of it.
[00:39:54.341 --> 00:39:54.681]  800-259-9231.
[00:39:54.962 --> 00:39:57.724]  Look, I don't screen your calls.
[00:39:58.204 --> 00:40:03.669]  But man, I'm opening the phones up about Ted Cruz, the man of the month, the man of the year.
[00:40:04.149 --> 00:40:05.731]  Because that, let me tell you something, folks.
[00:40:06.211 --> 00:40:14.318]  I've tried to do 24-hour broadcast, and I can do it, but I turn into a bumbling moron, even playing like hour-long videos and stuff.
[00:40:14.738 --> 00:40:16.160]  That's shitting on my butt.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.621]  In fact, they say it's better to actually stand.
[00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:20.845]  Ted Cruz went 21 hours, was still ready to go.
[00:40:20.865 --> 00:40:22.708]  He's going to be on Limbaugh later today.
[00:40:22.728 --> 00:40:28.817]  He literally is manning up and going over everything and being funny about it at the same time.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.762]  It's that spirit of liberty.
[00:40:32.549 --> 00:40:33.810]  It's that leadership.
[00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:38.693]  People say, oh, it's too big, the spy grid, the torture grid, the military has too much power.
[00:40:38.873 --> 00:40:40.214]  The military's all waking up.
[00:40:40.454 --> 00:40:42.115]  The police, I know, are all waking up.
[00:40:42.476 --> 00:40:49.320]  People decide we're just beaten by Hillary and Harry Reid and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and a bunch of globalists.
[00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:51.982]  Most of the rich people, I know.
[00:40:53.203 --> 00:40:54.784]  And I've gotten to know a lot of them over the years.
[00:40:55.868 --> 00:40:57.049]  They all know about the new rule of order.
[00:40:57.089 --> 00:40:57.850]  They're all upset.
[00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.051]  They don't like the way it's going.
[00:40:59.091 --> 00:41:03.736]  They just try to shut up because they're scared and they're not realizing shutting up is not going to protect them.
[00:41:04.297 --> 00:41:05.438]  They're all getting hammered.
[00:41:06.699 --> 00:41:08.461]  People worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:41:08.501 --> 00:41:10.303]  People with billions of dollars in assets.
[00:41:12.395 --> 00:41:20.358]  In Hollywood, and in construction, and in food, and restaurants, and companies, and sports teams, and... You know, I mean, talk about growing up.
[00:41:20.518 --> 00:41:21.978]  I was at Charlie Sheen's house.
[00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:24.899]  God bless him before he went off the rails and everything, but he's better now.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.200]  Good friend of mine.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.421]  A really smart guy when he's not focused on the ladies and everything.
[00:41:31.502 --> 00:41:34.483]  And in his own words, he makes Errol Flynn look like a wimp.
[00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.671]  That's not bragging, that's fact.
[00:41:37.412 --> 00:41:38.633]  Makes Casanova look weak.
[00:41:39.193 --> 00:41:46.659]  The point is, is that I knew Charlie back when he was married to Denise Richards and totally straight, just drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes and exercising.
[00:41:47.479 --> 00:41:51.502]  And really a very smart person, and of course I've known him all through the years, since about 2005.
[00:41:52.503 --> 00:41:57.207]  But I remember he wanted to put Loose Change Final Cut in theaters, and it was a real rollout.
[00:41:58.443 --> 00:41:58.764]  I don't know.
[00:42:20.331 --> 00:42:21.651]  They're going to put me in jail.
[00:42:21.691 --> 00:42:23.592]  They said they're going to find something I've done in the stock market.
[00:42:23.612 --> 00:42:24.292]  I haven't done anything.
[00:42:24.852 --> 00:42:26.112]  I've got to bow out of this, man.
[00:42:26.192 --> 00:42:27.613]  I mean, man, they're listening to the phones.
[00:42:29.153 --> 00:42:30.113]  I just got threatened.
[00:42:30.554 --> 00:42:31.154]  They didn't care.
[00:42:31.174 --> 00:42:37.595]  They still went after him with the Securities and Exchange Commission over some $800,000 stock deal.
[00:42:37.915 --> 00:42:40.656]  The guy was worth billions of dollars claiming that he knew about it.
[00:42:41.356 --> 00:42:42.456]  It was like Martha Stewart.
[00:42:43.117 --> 00:42:43.597]  It was nothing.
[00:42:44.077 --> 00:42:45.197]  And it came out in the New York Times.
[00:42:45.237 --> 00:42:48.658]  The emails they even sent him saying, we're going to put you in jail.
[00:42:49.912 --> 00:42:52.212]  For talking about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:42:52.773 --> 00:42:58.514]  And Cuban even rolled over, and they started an SEC investigation, and told his lawyers, we don't care.
[00:42:58.734 --> 00:43:00.774]  Now, he beat them, but they still keep coming after him.
[00:43:01.774 --> 00:43:06.935]  Because if anybody gets out of line, if one hand stands up, they might all stand up.
[00:43:07.196 --> 00:43:12.137]  Now, I was sworn to secrecy on that, and later told I could talk about it once Cuban released the email.
[00:43:13.517 --> 00:43:18.858]  Did anybody get in trouble with the Undersecretary of the Security and Exchange Commission?
[00:43:19.943 --> 00:43:31.450]  The assistant to the head of the Securities Exchange Commission, telling him that we're going to put you in jail.
[00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:37.093]  And it's so arrogant, sending emails saying we're going to set you up and send you to jail.
[00:43:37.933 --> 00:43:44.297]  See, see, see, that's the thing you've got to understand, folks, is that there is an intimidation campaign going on.
[00:43:46.008 --> 00:43:53.991]  And everyone basically gives into it, and that's why we're in so much trouble, because no one can say no, so these crooks have unlimited power.
[00:44:00.354 --> 00:44:11.358]  The truth is, though, we had a major whistleblower who was on a tarmac at a US Air Force base with an aircraft loaded with weapons to fly to the Middle East.
[00:44:14.946 --> 00:44:19.329]  Tosh Plumlee yesterday, very famous whistleblower, still works for the CIA.
[00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:24.373]  Because he's on the light side, there's light side, dark side.
[00:44:26.515 --> 00:44:28.736]  And he said, they're going to come after me, they may kill me.
[00:44:29.297 --> 00:44:31.979]  Off air he was saying, yeah this is it, but I had to do it for my family.
[00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:34.100]  I'm 76 and I'm ready.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.362]  And that really happened yesterday.
[00:44:36.682 --> 00:44:38.724]  He said, I have the NATO source.
[00:44:39.344 --> 00:44:41.866]  You know, basically he's been flying in there himself.
[00:44:43.208 --> 00:44:47.987]  He says, that's how I make my living, but I'm not going to be part of this, arming Al Qaeda.
[00:44:51.749 --> 00:44:54.010]  This is a guy been flying guns since the fifties.
[00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.470]  He flew guns to set up Fidel Castro to begin with.
[00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:57.711]  That's in the church hearings, 1977.
[00:44:57.911 --> 00:44:59.971]  That guy's famous, folks.
[00:45:00.371 --> 00:45:01.952]  Hadn't been heard from in decades.
[00:45:02.532 --> 00:45:04.613]  Gagged in 1991 by Congress.
[00:45:05.353 --> 00:45:08.594]  Just went public, basically broke federal gag orders on air.
[00:45:09.154 --> 00:45:10.034]  I went along with it.
[00:45:10.194 --> 00:45:10.694]  Here I am.
[00:45:10.934 --> 00:45:12.255]  Come put me in jail, you criminals.
[00:45:12.855 --> 00:45:17.476]  We've got to draw our line in the sand, just like the Alamo, and say, you know what?
[00:45:17.536 --> 00:45:18.296]  We're all in.
[00:45:18.576 --> 00:45:19.517]  Cards on the table.
[00:45:19.877 --> 00:45:20.317]  Let's go.
[00:45:22.318 --> 00:45:25.400]  And if they kill me or somebody else, folks, that's just the way it is.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.242]  That's what it takes to be free.
[00:45:27.262 --> 00:45:28.383]  That's what our forebearers did.
[00:45:28.663 --> 00:45:29.463]  That is an honor.
[00:45:32.185 --> 00:45:35.188]  Being a man doesn't mean you go to football games and strut around and act tough.
[00:45:36.445 --> 00:45:37.966]  Being a man means you do the right thing.
[00:45:38.006 --> 00:45:40.868]  You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything.
[00:45:40.908 --> 00:45:43.430]  You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string.
[00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.913]  Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name.
[00:45:47.193 --> 00:45:49.555]  You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything.
[00:45:49.855 --> 00:45:52.757]  You can laugh at that cheesy country song, but that says it all.
[00:45:55.179 --> 00:46:02.965]  We might have been better off or lived in a bigger house if Dad had done a little more giving in, a little more backing down.
[00:46:04.241 --> 00:46:05.401]  Well, we always had plenty.
[00:46:05.802 --> 00:46:09.803]  You see, folks, the only reason we have anything is because there have been moral people in this country.
[00:46:09.823 --> 00:46:11.244]  There have been a lot of evil people, too.
[00:46:11.664 --> 00:46:15.346]  But when the morals go out the door, it's like the oxygen in a spaceship, folks.
[00:46:15.586 --> 00:46:17.006]  It's like opening the bulkhead.
[00:46:17.647 --> 00:46:19.847]  And the New World Order's saying, open the door, open the door.
[00:46:20.148 --> 00:46:21.028]  We're your friends.
[00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:28.011]  And like crazy people, we're opening the door for all the promised goodies Obama's gonna give us.
[00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:32.913]  And even when he cons everybody and the con is off, he's like, just follow me more, you'll get the free stuff.
[00:46:33.686 --> 00:46:34.427]  Follow me more.
[00:46:34.447 --> 00:46:35.488]  Here's some free food.
[00:46:35.728 --> 00:46:36.969]  Here's some free housing.
[00:46:37.209 --> 00:46:39.371]  But we're going to take your kids and give you all these shots.
[00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:40.312]  We love you.
[00:46:40.332 --> 00:46:41.753]  We love you.
[00:46:50.081 --> 00:46:51.502]  There's a science fiction movie.
[00:46:51.702 --> 00:46:54.205]  I can't remember the name of it, where the woman's lost her kid.
[00:46:55.728 --> 00:47:01.770]  And there's basically like these entities that are trying to trick them to open the bulkheads and stuff, and she's like, it's my child!
[00:47:01.991 --> 00:47:02.571]  I've got to see him!
[00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:04.252]  And she opens it up and gets sucked out into space.
[00:47:04.272 --> 00:47:07.193]  That's in a couple movies, but that's kind of the analogy.
[00:47:07.393 --> 00:47:09.274]  They're like, come, we're your friends!
[00:47:09.914 --> 00:47:11.314]  Like, sirens, happy!
[00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:12.375]  We're loving!
[00:47:12.415 --> 00:47:13.815]  Don't listen to the hateful man!
[00:47:13.855 --> 00:47:15.176]  He talks in a gruff voice!
[00:47:15.556 --> 00:47:16.196]  Men are bad!
[00:47:16.236 --> 00:47:17.377]  Talk in an NPR voice!
[00:47:17.877 --> 00:47:18.797]  We're friends!
[00:47:19.458 --> 00:47:20.518]  Open the gate!
[00:47:20.798 --> 00:47:21.278]  Open it!
[00:47:21.299 --> 00:47:23.259]  You open the gate and a bunch of demons pour in!
[00:47:23.339 --> 00:47:24.120]  I mean, it's...
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:30.566]  It's so incredible to see all this happening and to see history taking place right now.
[00:47:30.586 --> 00:47:38.994]  I want to play a funny clip from Ted Cruz where he was doing his Darth Vader imitation at 5 in the morning after he'd already been up there for 15 hours or so.
[00:47:39.755 --> 00:47:42.858]  Here is a clip of him describing Obama as Darth Vader.
[00:47:43.058 --> 00:47:45.621]  We need a rebellion against oppression.
[00:47:48.023 --> 00:47:48.764]  It reminded me
[00:47:50.874 --> 00:48:01.157]  Of a movie series that was in the theaters when the Senator from Kentucky and I were both kids, young adults, and that was the Star Wars franchise.
[00:48:02.318 --> 00:48:06.479]  The discussion of a rebellion against oppression, I think it captures a lot of what's going on here.
[00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:16.462]  And I will confess that phrase, a rebellion against oppression, conjured up to me the Rebel Alliance fighting against the Empire.
[00:48:17.557 --> 00:48:19.258]  The empire being the Washington D.C.
[00:48:19.298 --> 00:48:19.899]  establishment.
[00:48:20.219 --> 00:48:35.511]  And indeed, immediately on hearing that phrase, I wondered if at some point we were going to see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forward and say in a deep voice, Mike Lee, I am your father.
[00:48:38.866 --> 00:48:41.928]  Oh man, and I tell you where Ted Cruz gets it is his dad.
[00:48:41.988 --> 00:48:43.649]  Obviously in the last few months he's been giving speeches.
[00:48:43.669 --> 00:48:45.090]  I want to get him on the show, by the way.
[00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:53.836]  And we've really seen how articulate and intelligent Ted Cruz's dad is, who lived under Fidel Castro.
[00:48:54.397 --> 00:49:08.306]  And it's good to see Cubans who fight tyranny instead of our Austin police chief, whose dad ran guns to fight the communists down there, who says he's a big, you know, patriot, but goes and joins Obama to take our guns.
[00:49:09.306 --> 00:49:13.528]  I bet Art Acevedo could get a position under Fidel Castro if he goes to Cuba.
[00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:16.870]  I bet they can make him a police chief and he can take all the guns while he already took them.
[00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:23.033]  And I'm not trying to sit here and pick fights with people, but I'm sick of folks saying they're patriots.
[00:49:24.611 --> 00:49:26.492]  And not being real patriots.
[00:49:26.612 --> 00:49:27.733]  It's disgusting.
[00:49:28.354 --> 00:49:32.437]  And it's time for us to stop being nice and playing patty cake with everybody.
[00:49:32.457 --> 00:49:38.641]  We're going to start the next hour here in about 10 minutes, then I'll go to Sean and Dave and Chad and Robert and Bill and get everybody's take on that.
[00:49:38.661 --> 00:49:45.126]  I want to play, after the break, last four or five minutes of Ted Cruz, when we come back.
[00:49:46.184 --> 00:49:48.045]  That was a 21-hour filibuster he gave today.
[00:49:48.545 --> 00:49:50.746]  And then there's all the other news that we haven't gotten to.
[00:49:50.786 --> 00:49:58.710]  We have, again, YouTube censoring documented facts with Dr. Jerome Corsi about Obama arming al-Qaeda.
[00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:59.290]  That's a fact.
[00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.132]  And it being connected to those groups to the Nairobi attack in Kenya.
[00:50:03.672 --> 00:50:05.293]  They are now censoring that video.
[00:50:05.853 --> 00:50:08.554]  They are now blocking that video for the general public.
[00:50:08.574 --> 00:50:10.175]  You cannot watch it on smartphones.
[00:50:10.235 --> 00:50:11.195]  I checked two of them this morning.
[00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:19.338]  And on the regular computer, you have to agree that you're an adult to see the evil, because it's potentially offensive or graphic.
[00:50:19.358 --> 00:50:20.219]  It's not true.
[00:50:20.979 --> 00:50:25.001]  And, hey, usually when I criticize Saudi Arabia funding Al-Qaeda, they actually take the video down.
[00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:26.381]  Then I have to threaten to sue YouTube.
[00:50:26.421 --> 00:50:27.782]  People go, why don't you just leave YouTube?
[00:50:28.202 --> 00:50:29.763]  They hold themselves out as a commons.
[00:50:30.043 --> 00:50:32.324]  They build themselves on the content we produce.
[00:50:32.724 --> 00:50:34.165]  Our goal is just to reach the general public.
[00:50:34.991 --> 00:50:42.075]  Because we're on AM and FM stations, and shortwave, and XM, and that's great to reach libertarian conservative listeners.
[00:50:42.555 --> 00:50:45.437]  I want to be on YouTube to reach the general dumbed-down public.
[00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:47.178]  That's why we're there.
[00:50:48.139 --> 00:50:51.841]  That's why we have PrisonPlanet.tv to feed it, so they can't shut us down.
[00:50:52.401 --> 00:50:54.683]  Everybody should become PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:50:54.743 --> 00:50:56.344]  It's $5.95 a month.
[00:50:56.364 --> 00:50:56.945]  11 memberships.
[00:50:57.485 --> 00:50:58.686]  You can see all the stuff uncensored.
[00:50:58.866 --> 00:51:03.330]  I'm sick of how the big drug companies are keeping men from fixing their ED without pills.
[00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:10.235]  Matt Cook here from GetEDSolutions.com, and I've helped thousands of men fully recover from ED without pills, pumps, or supplements.
[00:51:10.336 --> 00:51:14.439]  But the big drug companies collect $5 billion in revenue from sales of ED medications.
[00:51:14.639 --> 00:51:16.000]  They don't want my message to get out.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.281]  Things are so much better now.
[00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:19.863]  Everything kind of came back overnight.
[00:51:20.063 --> 00:51:22.085]  My girlfriend, very happy.
[00:51:22.225 --> 00:51:25.587]  I purchased your product yesterday and it was fantastic.
[00:51:25.767 --> 00:51:29.109]  I have used your system for about three weeks and I'm already seeing great results.

[00:54:06.656 --> 00:54:14.921]  You know, out in Hollywood, they are buying up armored cars that electrocute people, luxury cars, or that shock people in record numbers.
[00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:25.808]  You gotta love how all the anti-gun people have bodyguards, they have special permits, they have armed guards at their houses like Piers Morgan, but they don't want you to be able to be armed.
[00:54:26.747 --> 00:54:32.416]  And now there's been another shooting outside a New Jersey mall, obviously, so they're making a big deal out of some gang-related event.
[00:54:32.957 --> 00:54:38.205]  With perception over reality, with overall crime involving guns down 49% since 1992, Justice Department's own numbers.
[00:54:38.225 --> 00:54:38.485]  Look it up.
[00:54:41.158 --> 00:54:42.638]  They hate that fact.
[00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:44.719]  They absolutely hate the fact.
[00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:49.621]  Meanwhile, leftists who cheered abortion filibuster slam Ted Cruz.
[00:54:50.181 --> 00:55:01.004]  That's up on Infowars.com, the very same Huffington Post that filibuster heard around the world about the partial birth abortion pusher down here in Texas that they love so much.
[00:55:01.844 --> 00:55:08.126]  Meanwhile, they say Cruz hijacks Senate until I'm unable to stand and they all talk about how disgusting and horrible he is.
[00:55:08.666 --> 00:55:09.647]  Yeah, that terrible guy.
[00:55:10.726 --> 00:55:12.927]  He's not for killing babies and having the government pay for it.
[00:55:13.427 --> 00:55:20.169]  Double down, Obamacare will increase average individual market insurance premiums by 99% for men, 62% for women.
[00:55:20.189 --> 00:55:21.129]  That's a national average.
[00:55:21.469 --> 00:55:28.371]  In states like Tennessee, it's a 290% increase for men, 197% for women.
[00:55:31.232 --> 00:55:31.752]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:33.213]  The government wrote it.
[00:55:33.373 --> 00:55:36.494]  I mean, with a bunch of insurance companies, what do you think they're going to do?
[00:55:36.534 --> 00:55:37.234]  They're going to rape you.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.683]  But why don't you just stick an Obama sticker on your car and just be a chump?
[00:55:42.383 --> 00:55:44.204]  I know it's fun, so go ahead and do it.

[00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:55.713]  I don't even know how long we'll be able to be on there or how long I'll even let our stuff be on there.
[00:55:56.423 --> 00:55:57.104]  I'm really torn.

[00:56:19.447 --> 00:56:25.774]  Let's go out to break here with Ted Cruz's final comments after 21 hours that ended just about an hour ago.
[00:56:25.814 --> 00:56:26.174]  Here it is.
[00:56:26.435 --> 00:56:35.884]  I thank the Senator from Idaho for his question and for his steadfast leadership and willingness to stand up and fight for the American people to stop this train wreck that is Obamacare.
[00:56:36.885 --> 00:56:39.108]  And the answer to my friend's question is of course no.
[00:56:40.305 --> 00:56:43.206]  Small businesses all over this country are getting hammered by Obamacare.
[00:56:43.226 --> 00:56:45.547]  And you know, the real losers are not even the small business owners.
[00:56:45.887 --> 00:56:59.392]  The real losers are the people, the teenage kids who would get hired, the single moms who would get hired, the African Americans, the Hispanics, who are suddenly finding themselves either without a job or forcibly reduced to 29 hours a week.
[00:57:01.661 --> 00:57:06.702]  And denied the opportunity to get to that first rung of the economic ladder, which would give them the second and the third and the fourth.
[00:57:07.163 --> 00:57:10.283]  Millions of Americans are hurting under Obamacare.
[00:57:11.464 --> 00:57:26.468]  And it is my plea to this body, to the Democrats, that they listen to the unions that are asking on behalf of millions of Americans who are struggling to repeal Obamacare, and that we not have a system
[00:57:27.657 --> 00:57:34.620]  Where the rich and powerful, where big corporations and members of Congress are treated to a different set of rules than hard-working Americans.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.602]  President Obama has granted exemptions illegally to big businesses and members of Congress.
[00:57:40.882 --> 00:57:44.324]  I don't think the American people should be subject to harsher rules.
[00:57:45.563 --> 00:58:04.209]  And so my plea to this body is that we listen to the American people, because if we listen to our constituents, the answer is defund this bill that isn't working, that's hurting the American people, that's killing jobs, that's forcing people into part-time work, that's driving up health insurance premiums, and that's causing millions to lose or fear that they will lose their health insurance.
[00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:12.692]  I will close, as the time is wrapping up, by noting when at noon we will have a prayer.
[00:58:13.803 --> 00:58:16.685]  And I think it's fitting that this debate conclude with a prayer.
[00:58:18.047 --> 00:58:25.873]  Because I would ask that everyone in this body ask for the Lord's guidance.
[00:58:26.534 --> 00:58:27.094]  Amen to that.
[00:58:27.194 --> 00:58:32.339]  On how we best listen to our constituents, listen to the pleas for help that are coming from our constituents.
[00:58:32.359 --> 00:58:32.799]  That's right.
[00:58:32.819 --> 00:58:37.123]  Alright folks, second hour coming up and Harry Reid interrupted.
[00:58:41.363 --> 00:58:45.245]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:48.807 --> 00:58:52.089]  Every three seconds, someone becomes a victim of identity theft.
[00:58:52.369 --> 00:58:56.472]  We also hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on U.S.
[00:58:56.512 --> 00:58:56.992]  citizens.

[00:59:51.668 --> 00:59:53.608]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.048 --> 00:59:56.809]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:16.613]  People are getting really sick and tired of the unjust system where the politicians and the offshore banks are tax exempt, Obamacare exempt.
[01:00:33.956 --> 01:00:38.777]  And then they use all these taxes and regulations to destroy us politically so we're dependent on them.
[01:00:39.137 --> 01:00:40.077]  It really boils down to that.
[01:00:40.117 --> 01:00:42.858]  Ted Cruz an hour ago concluded a 21-hour filibuster.
[01:00:43.378 --> 01:00:49.499]  The establishment authoritarian media that poses as liberals are reeling in frothing anger right now.
[01:00:49.539 --> 01:00:50.720]  They want to break this country.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.100]  They want to collectivize things.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.501]  The Republican leadership wants that as well.
[01:00:54.561 --> 01:00:55.961]  They hate Cruz and Rand Paul.
[01:00:56.661 --> 01:00:58.743]  They hate us, but it doesn't matter.
[01:00:58.803 --> 01:01:06.829]  We're winning the hearts and minds of the American people, and of mainline conservatives, and of the military, and of liberals that are real liberals, and who aren't authoritarians.
[01:01:07.529 --> 01:01:11.653]  Let's go to your phone calls and get your take on Ted Cruz and this historic speech he gave.
[01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:13.814]  Sean in Wyoming, thanks for calling in.
[01:01:13.834 --> 01:01:15.215]  What's your take on what you just heard?
[01:01:15.235 --> 01:01:20.579]  He was articulate, composed, and extraordinary.
[01:01:20.679 --> 01:01:21.380]  Was he not?
[01:01:22.421 --> 01:01:23.702]  He's very presidential, yes.
[01:01:24.626 --> 01:01:26.867]  And the thing of it is, is I watched it all night.
[01:01:26.927 --> 01:01:31.928]  I fell asleep by the television and then I woke up and it seems like you saw some of that too.
[01:01:32.408 --> 01:01:36.169]  But it was extraordinary because Mike Lee from Utah was there as well.
[01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:45.792]  And he, Mike Lee, went in, had a little dissertation in the middle of the morning, which is unfortunate because most of Americans weren't able to see it.
[01:01:46.397 --> 01:01:51.583]  But he talked about, ultimately, those of us that believe in the Constitution.
[01:01:51.603 --> 01:02:00.373]  The Constitution trumps any unconstitutional ruling that may occur from time to time.
[01:02:00.393 --> 01:02:02.035]  Yeah, that's Marbury versus Madison.
[01:02:02.777 --> 01:02:03.418]  Absolutely.
[01:02:03.718 --> 01:02:04.439]  Absolutely.
[01:02:04.619 --> 01:02:08.803]  And you know, these guys are very well-scholared on the Constitution.
[01:02:09.063 --> 01:02:15.089]  Rand Paul, Lee, and Cruz, and to some extent Rubio in Florida.
[01:02:15.709 --> 01:02:18.532]  And you know, they've come out of this movement in 2010.
[01:02:19.993 --> 01:02:31.841]  When people started to get mad at the politicians that voted, originally voted for this Obamacare, and we need that to occur next year with that much more diligence.
[01:02:31.961 --> 01:02:33.942]  But it was extraordinary to watch.
[01:02:36.223 --> 01:02:42.147]  I agree with you, and even if they're unable to repeal it now, it will get repealed, and just because we're resisting.
[01:02:42.447 --> 01:02:45.489]  We didn't even have a resistance movement five years ago.
[01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:47.491]  The Republicans were trying to co-opt the Tea Party.
[01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:48.051]  They failed.
[01:02:49.247 --> 01:02:57.090]  And so now, Harry Reid's gone from saying the Tea Party has no power to last week throwing fits saying the Tea Party runs things.
[01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:00.372]  Notice, every time I watch Fox News and see Karl Rove, what's he doing?
[01:03:01.552 --> 01:03:02.712]  Bad-mouthing the Tea Party.
[01:03:02.732 --> 01:03:03.673]  He tried to take it over.
[01:03:05.354 --> 01:03:06.095]  And he couldn't do it.
[01:03:06.135 --> 01:03:07.737]  We're done with blue-blood Republicans.
[01:03:08.258 --> 01:03:10.941]  We're done with all these authoritarian Democrats.
[01:03:11.442 --> 01:03:12.904]  I'm not calling them liberals anymore.
[01:03:12.964 --> 01:03:14.065]  They are criminals.
[01:03:14.466 --> 01:03:15.447]  And they know they're criminals.
[01:03:15.487 --> 01:03:20.913]  I mean, look, the family business with all these people is race-baiting and fighting and dependency.
[01:03:20.954 --> 01:03:23.356]  I mean, these are really disgusting people.
[01:03:24.057 --> 01:03:30.486]  And if we just politically discredit them and speak out against them and stop getting intimidated by them, it's over.
[01:03:30.567 --> 01:03:31.648]  That's how humanity works.
[01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:35.554]  Doesn't matter how much police state, how much garbage, it's over.
[01:03:35.674 --> 01:03:36.215]  It's Trump.
[01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:37.817]  The Soviet Union couldn't stand.
[01:03:38.257 --> 01:03:39.399]  East Germany couldn't stand.
[01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:42.812]  When the people withdrew their consent.
[01:03:43.493 --> 01:03:51.940]  And that's why people like Lou Rockwell were so freaked out by Lord Loving Means Well, people like Adam Kokesh.
[01:03:52.441 --> 01:03:56.264]  They don't want to give them an excuse to start some physical confrontation when we
[01:03:57.432 --> 01:03:58.012]  Are you kidding?
[01:04:20.745 --> 01:04:21.466]  God bless you, sir.
[01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:22.407]  I appreciate you calling in.
[01:04:22.587 --> 01:04:24.408]  I mean, Dr. Corsi's joining us in an hour.
[01:04:24.608 --> 01:04:25.790]  Look at this, right here on my iPhone.
[01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:29.313]  This video contains restricted content.
[01:04:30.194 --> 01:04:34.457]  Cannot watch it on my iPhone, even if I agree to the parental stuff.
[01:04:34.658 --> 01:04:35.658]  There's nothing on there.
[01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:43.245]  And most people can't even watch it now, showing how Obama is connected to the Kenyan Islamist extremists that killed all those people.
[01:04:45.107 --> 01:04:45.607]  You see that?
[01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:51.388]  This is the kind of stuff we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen, because we're effective!
[01:04:51.728 --> 01:04:54.172]  And I'm not saying that to go, hey, we're effective, we're cool.
[01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:55.935]  We're effective, we can win!
[01:04:56.195 --> 01:04:57.036]  If you fight back!

[01:06:58.311 --> 01:07:02.894]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:07:03.034 --> 01:07:05.996]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:11.380]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.381]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:14.962]  We are what we eat.
[01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:19.605]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:07:19.946 --> 01:07:23.908]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:07:24.188 --> 01:07:26.450]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:32.632]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:08:08.288 --> 01:08:09.109]  You want answers?
[01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:10.771]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:11.432 --> 01:08:15.057]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.617 --> 01:08:19.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.048 --> 01:08:24.169]  Well, Senator Ted Cruz has done it.
[01:08:24.369 --> 01:08:33.173]  A historical 21-hour filibuster shut down by the creature, Harry Reid, the most unpopular politician in America, according to Gallup.
[01:08:33.253 --> 01:08:42.716]  And as you know, between 19 and 17 percent, depending on what group they ask in Gallup, but the highest is 19 percent, trust and support in government all-time low.
[01:08:43.397 --> 01:08:51.000]  As I've told you the last few years, but especially the last few months, a total collapse in confidence in the system, the military
[01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:56.302]  Anybody that's been in more than a couple years, I'd say 90% awake.
[01:08:57.063 --> 01:09:03.625]  The young guys that get in for economic reasons or whatever, they just want to play video games or kill people, not many of them are awake.
[01:09:03.665 --> 01:09:09.328]  But anybody who's been in, anybody that's seen how the world works, is waking up right now.
[01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:16.351]  And for those that don't know, when the military and the police wake up with a regime, it's over.
[01:09:17.352 --> 01:09:21.394]  That's why the system, the globalists that have captured this government, that occupy it.
[01:09:21.414 --> 01:09:22.394]  And those aren't words.
[01:09:22.975 --> 01:09:26.756]  The globalists write books bragging that they have captured America.
[01:09:28.777 --> 01:09:33.319]  And these guys are about to get crowned king nothing because they are falling down.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.681]  Humpty Dumpty, folks, has fallen down.
[01:09:37.261 --> 01:09:38.602]  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[01:09:38.622 --> 01:09:40.083]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[01:09:40.803 --> 01:09:44.725]  All the king's horses and all the king's men aren't going to put the new world order together again.
[01:09:45.376 --> 01:09:53.204]  Now, just like Hitler, by the time he lost the Battle of Britain and the West started gearing up to invade the continent of Europe, he was going to lose World War II probably then.
[01:09:53.684 --> 01:09:57.408]  So, but he still doubled down and invaded Russia with Operation Barbarossa.
[01:10:00.271 --> 01:10:11.643]  And the dream there was they would take over the Aryan areas, as they saw it, of Western Russia and conscript them into, you know, magic SS armies to defeat everybody, and that didn't happen.
[01:10:11.663 --> 01:10:15.147]  Because see, the Russians faced a frontal assault and couldn't give up.
[01:10:15.708 --> 01:10:17.390]  They had to fight for their lives, and they won.
[01:10:18.693 --> 01:10:21.676]  And it was really the Russians, folks, that predominantly beat the Germans.
[01:10:22.236 --> 01:10:35.249]  I mean, the Western Allies had a big part of that as well, maybe 20-30% of it, but it was the Russians that were in the big, you know, million-man wars, and hundreds of thousands dying, and Stalingrad, you know, Leningrad, just unbelievable stuff.
[01:10:35.629 --> 01:10:37.951]  I say Stalingrad, Leningrad, they were changing the name all the time.
[01:10:37.971 --> 01:10:38.231]  It's St.
[01:10:38.271 --> 01:10:39.172]  Petersburg today.
[01:10:39.192 --> 01:10:42.796]  This is the type of stuff that's gone on historically.
[01:10:43.775 --> 01:10:51.898]  And the globalists have put in their control grids, their spy grids, they're trying to acclimate everybody to illegal spying and secret arrests, but it's not working.
[01:10:52.399 --> 01:10:54.039]  It's just freaking everybody out.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.581]  And everybody knows they're exempt from the taxes and regulations.
[01:10:57.881 --> 01:11:00.482]  Everybody knows they're doing it to shut down their competition.
[01:11:00.762 --> 01:11:02.723]  Everybody knows they're really slimy.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:09.046]  Except for maybe 15% of people that are on welfare and work for the system.
[01:11:09.647 --> 01:11:11.869]  Even people that have government jobs know it's pure bull.
[01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:22.962]  You do have some folks that literally think Obama's their daddy, like Chris Rock, and other folks that think he's, you know, our Lord and Savior Barack Obama.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.201]  Fox said, what's his name, Jamie Foxx?
[01:11:26.842 --> 01:11:30.144]  It just gives me a headache to see how they're delusional.
[01:11:30.204 --> 01:11:34.288]  It's like a guy on PCP jumps off a building thinking he has wings and kills himself.
[01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:36.369]  That's how Jamie Foxx and Chris Rock are.
[01:11:36.429 --> 01:11:37.470]  I want them to be free.
[01:11:38.171 --> 01:11:39.171]  I want them to be happy.
[01:11:39.191 --> 01:11:44.135]  But they're just imagining they're winning as there's a black president when it's all a corporate con game.
[01:11:45.216 --> 01:11:48.859]  And racial divisions at all-time highs, the black unemployment rates double.
[01:11:49.399 --> 01:11:51.401]  I literally want people to be prosperous.
[01:11:52.856 --> 01:12:01.099]  I literally want everybody to be successful and then I have to sit here and be called racist by MSNBC and CNN without showing evidence.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:04.601]  That shows the incredible propaganda war we've entered.
[01:12:05.882 --> 01:12:12.268]  Where we give you facts, numbers, statistics, and if we say Obama says raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise debt, we play the clip.
[01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:15.451]  If we say Ted Cruz said this, we play the clip.
[01:12:15.692 --> 01:12:18.174]  If we say a bill says this, we show you the bill.
[01:12:18.414 --> 01:12:19.996]  If we say a poll says this, we show you the bill.
[01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:25.461]  Not with Harry Reid, Barack Obama gets up and says 90% of Americans want to turn their guns in or whatever.
[01:12:25.862 --> 01:12:27.103]  It's actually the opposite numbers.
[01:12:28.948 --> 01:12:30.669]  So we're at a historical point.
[01:12:30.769 --> 01:12:36.592]  The issue here is, are we going to be able to turn the tide and turn this around?
[01:12:36.672 --> 01:12:44.857]  Our guest is coming up at the bottom of the hour, dealing with Veterans for Peace from the left angle trying to impeach Obama.
[01:12:44.937 --> 01:12:50.040]  And why is the president of Veterans for Peace not moving to impeach Obama when he moved to impeach Bush?
[01:12:51.035 --> 01:12:52.656]  Well, because he's a Peace Prize winner, obviously.
[01:12:53.397 --> 01:12:55.238]  I tell you, Hitler should have got a Peace Prize, folks.
[01:12:55.258 --> 01:12:57.040]  We'd be speaking German right now.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:00.523]  And if he wore a pink uniform, it'd have been over.
[01:13:01.523 --> 01:13:05.867]  And had a feng shui person over and, like, set up the right chancellery under feng shui.
[01:13:06.728 --> 01:13:12.032]  Isn't feng shui that thing where you arrange the house according to some... I'm making sure I'm getting it right there.
[01:13:13.404 --> 01:13:14.885]  According to the Easter Bunny.
[01:13:15.185 --> 01:13:17.287]  The Pointer, Santa Claus, or whatever it is.
[01:13:17.928 --> 01:13:20.089]  This is the type of stuff we're dealing with here.
[01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:23.872]  And we've got a lot of other serious news I'm going to get to as well after we take calls.
[01:13:24.513 --> 01:13:27.836]  Senator warns Obama not to implement UN arms treaty.
[01:13:28.236 --> 01:13:31.298]  That's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:13:31.819 --> 01:13:35.262]  New America has a report up on InfoWars.com by Joe Wolverton.
[01:13:36.222 --> 01:13:39.123]  President Obama, quote, fired up and ready to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:13:39.563 --> 01:13:43.305]  That's what he said at the Black Caucus Foundation's Phoenix Awards Dinner.
[01:13:43.965 --> 01:13:49.847]  You know, the NRA was actually set up to arm... Christians set it up to arm newly freed black slaves who did not use guns.
[01:13:50.067 --> 01:13:51.208]  That's on record, by the way.
[01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:53.429]  As well as train Northerners how to shoot in general.
[01:13:54.629 --> 01:13:55.730]  It doesn't matter.
[01:13:56.070 --> 01:14:02.253]  They have the Black Caucus and others saying it's racist because blacks are getting killed.
[01:14:02.493 --> 01:14:05.854]  The gang culture is why people are killing each other, not the gun.
[01:14:06.494 --> 01:14:07.455]  Let's continue here.
[01:14:08.175 --> 01:14:09.636]  Kerry to sign U.N.
[01:14:09.816 --> 01:14:12.397]  arms treaty despite Senator's warning.
[01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:15.739]  That's an article out of Fox News mirroring the Infowars.com.
[01:14:16.079 --> 01:14:18.940]  Meanwhile, Hollywood's new favorite cars are armored and electrified.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.441]  They've got armed guards, but you can't have that.
[01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:22.902]  You can't be your own armed guard.
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:36.871]  You know, it's a really good feeling that we've got about five people that work here with concealed carries, and I've got a .357 right here and an M4 back in my office, and I'm just going to defend myself.
[01:14:36.891 --> 01:14:38.513]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:14:38.533 --> 01:14:42.656]  We've got guns in every room around here, and they hate that.
[01:14:42.696 --> 01:14:47.641]  The idea that, oh, government's got guns in every room to protect themselves, but I shouldn't have guns to protect myself.
[01:14:48.632 --> 01:14:51.093]  It's just like I've got a screwdriver over there if I need it too.
[01:14:51.433 --> 01:14:51.933]  It's a tool.
[01:14:51.953 --> 01:14:57.675]  It's not like it's some mythical, you know, spear of destiny that we have or something.
[01:14:57.715 --> 01:14:59.415]  It's that we don't live in fear.
[01:14:59.775 --> 01:15:01.876]  And we call 911 after we defend ourselves.
[01:15:03.176 --> 01:15:04.957]  That's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:05.337 --> 01:15:08.238]  Not like getting in a fetal position if somebody came here after us.
[01:15:08.258 --> 01:15:10.338]  I guess we're all just supposed to get in a fetal position.
[01:15:10.818 --> 01:15:13.019]  Notice the mass shooters always go to where they know there's no guns.
[01:15:15.319 --> 01:15:22.023]  That's the government training video say that if someone's trying to rape you, you vomit, urinate, or poop on them.
[01:15:23.724 --> 01:15:29.807]  Imagine, I have two daughters, and imagine, we've got them in mixed martial arts, we're teaching them how to shoot.
[01:15:30.327 --> 01:15:39.132]  I can't imagine telling my daughters, well, if a guy ever tries to rape you, you know, when you move out of home when you're 18 or whatever, I want you to vomit on him, or pee on him.
[01:15:39.193 --> 01:15:41.454]  I mean, it just shows the total
[01:15:43.558 --> 01:15:46.499]  Now there's the CNN headline, Beyond Vomiting, How to Prevent Rape.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.700]  Oh, this country is so screwed up.
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:16:09.066]  You gotta understand, the liberal followers are following an authoritarian religion, but they themselves are literally screwed up people who are into being disempowered and into hating masculinity, femininity, the family, and that's why their religion is screwing everything up, because they hate everyone.
[01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:11.584]  So that's some of the news on that front.
[01:16:11.604 --> 01:16:12.625]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:16:13.085 --> 01:16:16.767]  What did you think of Ted Cruz and his historic 21-hour speech?
[01:16:17.107 --> 01:16:17.807]  I just love it.
[01:16:18.247 --> 01:16:21.068]  Loved Rand Paul's filibuster, but it wasn't as long.
[01:16:21.528 --> 01:16:22.889]  This is what I want to see more of.
[01:16:23.429 --> 01:16:24.810]  And notice they said, oh, he'll be discredited.
[01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:25.950]  Oh, he's going to be demonized.
[01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:27.891]  His approval polls are up.
[01:16:30.796 --> 01:16:36.619]  It's a, oh, don't filibuster, don't stand against us, that's unpopular, talk with a listening NPR voice, you'll be successful.
[01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:41.761]  They tell you to do what they know won't defeat them.
[01:16:43.462 --> 01:16:52.786]  I mean, if they are wild, crazy, gibbering authoritarians that write books about putting fluoride in the water to sterilize us and hurt us, like John P. Holdren did,
[01:16:54.631 --> 01:17:00.536]  And call them degenerate eugenicists, ultra-Hitlerian control freaks.
[01:17:01.497 --> 01:17:05.160]  Just because they're extreme, don't dial back what you're going to say.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.064]  Because if it's sensational what they're doing, then it's sensational.
[01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:16.230]  And realize how sensational liberty is, and how effective you are, and how much power you have.
[01:17:17.645 --> 01:17:22.729]  So many activists always dream of master plans to free the world and wake everybody up with a master stroke.
[01:17:22.849 --> 01:17:26.111]  So many people write me letters on the street, if you just do this, if you just do that.
[01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:27.352]  I'm like, hey, you need to do it.
[01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:28.873]  You need to do it.
[01:17:28.893 --> 01:17:30.034]  But it will be bigger if you do it.
[01:17:30.074 --> 01:17:30.554]  No, it won't.
[01:17:30.955 --> 01:17:31.595]  You don't know that.
[01:17:31.855 --> 01:17:34.337]  It'll be bigger if all of us do little things every day.
[01:17:34.617 --> 01:17:39.701]  Go get a projector and project the First Amendment up on a city wall at night.
[01:17:39.901 --> 01:17:41.482]  The cops will probably come and arrest you.
[01:17:41.622 --> 01:17:42.923]  Then it'll be national news.
[01:17:43.864 --> 01:17:45.445]  Then the charges will get dropped.
[01:17:46.581 --> 01:17:47.262]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:17:47.502 --> 01:17:53.008]  They kept attacking red light cameras all over Arizona for about five years.
[01:17:53.028 --> 01:17:54.830]  Libertarians that I don't know who was involved.
[01:17:55.911 --> 01:17:57.213]  Somebody was physically attacking them.
[01:17:57.553 --> 01:17:58.354]  I don't know who did that.
[01:17:58.734 --> 01:18:04.381]  But other people just stand up there and point out it was happening until everybody started getting aware of it and they had to remove them.
[01:18:05.373 --> 01:18:07.474]  Because of the moral authority.
[01:18:08.094 --> 01:18:10.496]  Now in Florida you protest the cameras, they arrest you.
[01:18:10.696 --> 01:18:11.556]  Well then you sue them.
[01:18:11.816 --> 01:18:15.939]  You're going to have to fight, folks, and teach these servants they work for you.
[01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:20.081]  Teach the tyrants that you're not going to roll over, that you're not easy prey.
[01:18:21.622 --> 01:18:25.624]  I'm telling you, the American symbol is not an ostrich grabbing its ankles, folks.
[01:18:27.355 --> 01:18:36.202]  I'm telling you, you know, the new symbol of America is not a family bent over a car with the state police doing proctology exams on them for their safety.
[01:18:36.662 --> 01:18:40.025]  The state police know full well the government ships in the drugs and launders the money.
[01:18:40.905 --> 01:18:50.192]  They know that, and you need to tell them that when they're strutting around with a drill sergeant hat, getting in your face like you did something wrong, trying to have all this authority and fear over you.
[01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.174]  I've got Army PSYOP videos.
[01:18:53.055 --> 01:19:00.459]  About how to have confrontations with the public and dominate them, and then to act nice to them after you do to break their will in third world countries.
[01:19:00.739 --> 01:19:03.261]  When our government would advise dictators how to oppress people.
[01:19:03.301 --> 01:19:05.242]  It's an Obama deception 2 coming out.
[01:19:06.422 --> 01:19:08.484]  And I'm telling you, our cops, they don't even know it.
[01:19:08.504 --> 01:19:10.545]  They're told, do this for your safety, control the situation.
[01:19:10.825 --> 01:19:14.587]  They are being taught authoritarian systems to break America's back.
[01:19:16.826 --> 01:19:24.572]  They've twisted instincts of if you're by yourself and gotta deal with like five men, you better posture like you're in charge and everything or it could go bad.
[01:19:24.632 --> 01:19:25.553]  Yeah, that's different.
[01:19:25.853 --> 01:19:27.695]  Not with my wife and kids.
[01:19:28.015 --> 01:19:28.675]  Not with me.
[01:19:28.916 --> 01:19:30.537]  Not with two women on the side of the road.
[01:19:30.597 --> 01:19:34.060]  You're acting like a stormtrooper thug right out of hell.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.742]  And it's time for men to get right back in your face.
[01:19:37.042 --> 01:19:39.844]  But I'm just talking about the police because they're where the rubber meets the road.
[01:19:40.104 --> 01:19:41.706]  You gotta get bureaucrats' face.
[01:19:42.006 --> 01:19:45.829]  There's a reason the bureaucrats laugh at you and act like you're powerless, because they're scared to death of you.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.985]  I know they're getting ready for the lawsuit against the mayor and people over Floor on the Water.
[01:19:50.245 --> 01:19:50.726]  Where is it?
[01:19:50.766 --> 01:19:52.088]  I want to see ten lawsuits!
[01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:56.215]  I want to see you attack them politically, legally, and lawfully!
[01:19:56.235 --> 01:19:57.196]  This is a war!
[01:19:59.079 --> 01:20:03.963]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[01:20:04.444 --> 01:20:05.625]  What are bitcoins?
[01:20:06.065 --> 01:20:12.150]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[01:20:12.551 --> 01:20:13.992]  No bank needed.
[01:20:14.392 --> 01:20:19.697]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[01:20:20.077 --> 01:20:21.859]  You are in control of your money.
[01:20:22.319 --> 01:20:23.120]  And the best part?
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.724]  You can start earning and making money with bitcoins right away.
[01:20:27.104 --> 01:20:34.532]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[01:20:34.972 --> 01:20:38.636]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[01:23:06.977 --> 01:23:07.698]  This capitalism?
[01:23:07.758 --> 01:23:13.885]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:01.328]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:24:01.908 --> 01:24:04.769]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:07.531 --> 01:24:17.035]  A few days ago, we reported on a school where a neighbor saw children playing with airsoft plastic pellet guns.
[01:24:17.755 --> 01:24:21.177]  And so they called the school, and the school is suspending one boy for nine months.
[01:24:21.217 --> 01:24:22.037]  That's now official.
[01:24:22.957 --> 01:24:26.159]  And Fox News reports it like it's wrong, but says they have the power to do it.
[01:24:26.179 --> 01:24:28.280]  Folks, they don't have the power to do that.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.402]  The school needs to be sued.
[01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:32.043]  You've paid the property taxes.
[01:24:32.624 --> 01:24:33.885]  It's a government training center.
[01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:43.155]  And it shows how they now use the schools as they said they would do under UNESCO and the UN Treaty to take over everything.
[01:24:44.036 --> 01:24:45.717]  Your children belong to the state.
[01:24:46.418 --> 01:24:47.840]  Your kids are in their backyard.
[01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:55.955]  Playing with a spring-loaded, low-powered gun that shoots plastic pellets that my children target practice with.
[01:24:56.476 --> 01:24:57.096]  Great fun.
[01:24:57.316 --> 01:24:57.876]  Very safe.
[01:24:58.377 --> 01:25:05.161]  And a neighbor says they're uncomfortable, and so you are now kicked out of school for nine months.
[01:25:07.123 --> 01:25:12.186]  They said if he goes to classes and training and does good behavior, they might let him in next semester.
[01:25:14.434 --> 01:25:16.855]  And the parents are saying it's none of your business.
[01:25:16.875 --> 01:25:17.676]  The school goes, fine.
[01:25:18.096 --> 01:25:18.917]  Your kid's kicked out.
[01:25:19.277 --> 01:25:20.678]  We decide they're dangerous.
[01:25:21.798 --> 01:25:22.659]  We feel threatened.
[01:25:22.679 --> 01:25:23.580]  Just like in Texas now.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.281]  You got a rifle in your car or whatever.
[01:25:25.481 --> 01:25:26.081]  Cops pull you over.
[01:25:26.401 --> 01:25:28.823]  We feel alarmed by your rifle.
[01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:30.664]  We're gonna take you to jail, but my gun's legal.
[01:25:30.884 --> 01:25:32.025]  It don't matter, Jack!
[01:25:32.925 --> 01:25:33.706]  Just like YouTube.
[01:25:33.766 --> 01:25:36.367]  Hey, you got a video up there about Obama funding Al Qaeda?
[01:25:36.667 --> 01:25:38.108]  You got a top expert on about it?
[01:25:38.408 --> 01:25:39.789]  We're just gonna ban that video.
[01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:42.291]  YouTube community feels uncomfortable about that.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:43.980]  Because we're liberals!
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.281]  We feel uncomfortable about your kid with a plastic pellet gun.
[01:25:48.361 --> 01:25:49.401]  With an orange tip on it.
[01:25:50.142 --> 01:25:51.662]  It can't even give you a whelp on your arm.
[01:25:52.002 --> 01:25:53.102]  We feel uncomfortable!
[01:25:54.563 --> 01:25:56.683]  Your neighbor saw you cleaning your gun, sir, in your garage.
[01:25:56.703 --> 01:25:58.444]  Well, it's illegal to have my gun!
[01:25:58.464 --> 01:26:01.444]  Sir, we're taking you in for psychological evaluation.
[01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:02.805]  I see this in the news every day.
[01:26:03.465 --> 01:26:04.545]  This is what they do.
[01:26:04.665 --> 01:26:06.465]  This is their authoritarianism.
[01:26:06.746 --> 01:26:08.346]  Their totalitarianism.
[01:26:10.299 --> 01:26:11.259]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:26:11.279 --> 01:26:12.720]  I got a guest popping in for about 10 minutes.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:16.902]  He's got a really good initiative to try to get the left shamed in doing the right thing against Obama.
[01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:26.726]  But right now, and we'll go back to your calls, but right now, David Arizona, your take on Ted Cruz and what happened on that historic filibuster.
[01:26:26.746 --> 01:26:27.486]  What did you think of it?
[01:26:28.786 --> 01:26:30.047]  I thought it was great.
[01:26:30.127 --> 01:26:36.610]  It takes a lot of physical strength and stamina to stand for 21 hours and speak.
[01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:38.971]  Well, bigger than standing is the talking.
[01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:39.611]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:40.285 --> 01:26:46.931]  Yeah, and I've seen soldiers in the military pass out just standing in formation in the sun for maybe an hour.
[01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:49.633]  You know, and I've been close to that too.
[01:26:50.334 --> 01:26:56.039]  But I do want to say that I'm also thankful that he ended in prayer and asking for wisdom.
[01:26:57.296 --> 01:27:02.680]  Oh yeah, Putin got criticized for putting an editorial out last week calling for loving Jesus.
[01:27:04.262 --> 01:27:05.162]  What a dirty rat.
[01:27:05.202 --> 01:27:06.583]  He said families are important.
[01:27:06.664 --> 01:27:10.186]  Man, he needs to be fired like that Fox Sports reporter.
[01:27:10.206 --> 01:27:10.507]  Go ahead.
[01:27:11.345 --> 01:27:30.952]  Well, back to our forefathers now, who Ted Cruz is representing, and he's representing us, you and I. The very First Amendment, the first part of the First Amendment, they had the foresight, the wisdom, to put in, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.
[01:27:31.332 --> 01:27:33.634]  But they've already done that with our public schools.
[01:27:33.714 --> 01:27:35.255]  They're the synagogue of Satan.
[01:27:35.595 --> 01:27:39.098]  They teach the opposite of the Ten Commandments in the public schools.
[01:27:39.518 --> 01:27:42.581]  And they teach that man came from primordial ooze.
[01:27:44.067 --> 01:27:46.128]  4.5 billion years ago, which is a religion.
[01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:49.531]  So they are violating the First Amendment rights of your children.
[01:27:49.571 --> 01:27:52.072]  You should not even be sending your children to a public school.
[01:27:52.673 --> 01:28:00.118]  Well, you know, I don't get into debates about how God made the universe, but undoubtedly the whole, their theory of evolution has been proven a fraud.
[01:28:00.158 --> 01:28:01.959]  Darwin was one of the fathers of eugenics.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:08.744]  He claimed that he was demon-possessed for three days with a fever when he got the idea of evolution.
[01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:09.505]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[01:28:09.525 --> 01:28:10.065]  Look this up.
[01:28:10.085 --> 01:28:10.646]  This is a fact.
[01:28:11.406 --> 01:28:12.807]  I read the origin of the species.
[01:28:12.867 --> 01:28:13.927]  I've actually scanned over it.
[01:28:13.947 --> 01:28:16.989]  I didn't read the whole thing years ago, but I've scanned over it.
[01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:19.930]  Things do change.
[01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:20.850]  Cars evolve.
[01:28:20.890 --> 01:28:21.891]  Computers evolve.
[01:28:22.591 --> 01:28:30.475]  I mean, by evolve, you can breed big, strong men with big, strong women and get bigger, stronger people.
[01:28:30.495 --> 01:28:31.835]  I mean, there is breeding.
[01:28:31.855 --> 01:28:33.276]  There are changes out there.
[01:28:34.136 --> 01:28:35.297]  And the devil's very smart.
[01:28:35.337 --> 01:28:36.557]  They got the churches the last 170 years.
[01:28:38.078 --> 01:28:46.202]  To debate science like the Bible was unscientific, and then had preachers that weren't scientists debate other scientists who themselves had their own religion.
[01:28:46.582 --> 01:28:55.346]  And so it became all about fighting and discrediting the Bible by men projecting their ideas onto it to create a false debate.
[01:28:55.406 --> 01:28:58.448]  And it was pure genius, and I don't debate any of it.
[01:28:59.148 --> 01:29:02.291]  You know, the Bible is accurate about the heavens.
[01:29:02.311 --> 01:29:03.592]  So is the Koran, by the way.
[01:29:04.152 --> 01:29:08.796]  And so are, you know, famous Jewish historical writings.
[01:29:09.437 --> 01:29:14.621]  It was people the last thousand years, you know, leading up to the Renaissance, who thought the world was flat and all that.
[01:29:15.122 --> 01:29:17.144]  So, that was the Dark Ages, folks.
[01:29:17.904 --> 01:29:22.208]  And the point is, is that there is a force of evil and good in the universe.
[01:29:22.228 --> 01:29:24.270]  And there's a lot of... You notice there's 10,000 churches.
[01:29:25.931 --> 01:29:27.192]  There's 10,000 times 10,000.
[01:29:27.232 --> 01:29:33.775]  That's because everybody can fight on dogma to then break off and create their own group.
[01:29:34.996 --> 01:29:43.960]  And then you end up with, you know, a hundred different brands of each group out there with everybody being Pharisees saying everybody else is the devil.
[01:29:44.721 --> 01:29:46.862]  I just want to have a good heart and try to be a good person.
[01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:48.883]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:50.984]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.924 --> 01:29:54.606]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.670 --> 01:30:02.291]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:30:02.531 --> 01:30:07.812]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:30:08.053 --> 01:30:15.595]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:30:15.775 --> 01:30:24.897]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:30:25.097 --> 01:30:32.063]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:30:32.263 --> 01:30:33.784]  All of this is happening so fast.
[01:30:33.884 --> 01:30:35.166]  You need to be ahead of the game.
[01:30:35.486 --> 01:30:42.171]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[01:30:42.372 --> 01:30:43.673]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:30:43.693 --> 01:30:44.914]  Another plane just hit!
[01:30:44.954 --> 01:30:45.794]  State of Mind.
[01:30:46.035 --> 01:30:47.456]  Because there's a war on.
[01:30:47.596 --> 01:30:48.357]  For your mind.
[01:30:48.617 --> 01:30:52.680]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:53.401]  And remember,
[01:30:58.929 --> 01:31:03.832]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[01:31:04.432 --> 01:31:07.714]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[01:31:08.254 --> 01:31:11.136]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[01:31:11.676 --> 01:31:14.498]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[01:31:15.119 --> 01:31:21.142]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:31:21.743 --> 01:31:25.185]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:31:25.825 --> 01:31:36.511]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[01:31:37.231 --> 01:31:42.174]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[01:31:42.714 --> 01:31:50.581]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[01:33:09.651 --> 01:33:15.930]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.666 --> 01:33:26.487]  Chad in Kentucky, Robert in California, Bill in Pennsylvania, Frank in North Carolina, and others.
[01:33:26.527 --> 01:33:36.509]  Your calls are coming up as soon as we talk to a guest who heads up Veterans for Peace down in Central Florida about why the left won't go after Obama for all his war crimes.
[01:33:36.529 --> 01:33:38.349]  We're going to talk to him in just a moment.
[01:33:38.389 --> 01:33:42.470]  And then Foxconn, China plant, closes after 2000 riot.
[01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:49.671]  But don't worry, the robots, 15 million robots that have been ordered to China, 5 million of them by Foxconn to make the Apple iPhones,
[01:33:51.072 --> 01:33:52.012]  Yeah, bad news.
[01:33:52.052 --> 01:33:53.233]  You might not be getting that one.
[01:33:53.273 --> 01:33:55.813]  You've got the new Apple iPhones you've got pre-ordered.
[01:33:56.533 --> 01:34:03.215]  Sorry, they're committing suicide too fast and having forced abortions right now at the giant death facilities.
[01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:04.856]  And of course, I've got an iPhone.
[01:34:06.336 --> 01:34:08.737]  And I admit it's a tracker system to enslave me.
[01:34:09.634 --> 01:34:17.600]  And that it spies on everything I do, and Intel's coming out with their new chips for phones that are on all the time, and are actually powered by wireless, integrated with them.
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:19.522]  That's the whole story Steve Watson's working on.
[01:34:19.942 --> 01:34:22.785]  I mean, I know this is a little imperial probe droid.
[01:34:25.467 --> 01:34:27.809]  It's not that the technology isn't interesting and isn't useful.
[01:34:28.249 --> 01:34:32.953]  It's that we're not given this and allowed to buy this because the system loves us.
[01:34:34.798 --> 01:34:37.801]  It's because this is the Trojan horse of transhumanism.
[01:34:37.821 --> 01:34:39.302]  This is the eugenics god.
[01:34:39.943 --> 01:34:47.730]  This is our little guardian, our little watcher that lovingly kills us every day while we use it with the microwave radiation on record.
[01:34:49.172 --> 01:34:51.134]  And it was built in a giant death camp.
[01:34:52.861 --> 01:35:03.003]  With mass suicides, suicide nets, forced abortions, drugging them with anti-psychotics, 18 hours a day, people sleeping outside, their children chained to poles.
[01:35:03.463 --> 01:35:05.864]  The most vicious factories in the world build iPhones.
[01:35:08.264 --> 01:35:14.165]  Because the liberals demand more war and more death than anyone else, because they're not liberals, they are authoritarians.
[01:35:15.805 --> 01:35:18.186]  They disgrace the name liberal that Thomas Jefferson was.
[01:35:18.985 --> 01:35:20.326]  You need to understand what monsters they are.
[01:35:20.346 --> 01:35:23.008]  And you say, well, then you should vote with your dollars and not use this.
[01:35:23.348 --> 01:35:25.270]  Hey, the others are the same as well.
[01:35:28.132 --> 01:35:32.736]  They all run the gamut, but this is the rock bottom worst, is the Apple products.
[01:35:34.117 --> 01:35:40.842]  And I point out what this system is and have it here as an example to show you.
[01:35:42.764 --> 01:35:43.224]  You understand?
[01:35:43.244 --> 01:35:47.828]  It's like someone who's had an abortion coming out and telling you it's a bad idea.
[01:35:49.565 --> 01:35:53.467]  We're not judging anybody that has these, but people think it's a status symbol.
[01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:55.668]  It's shameful to have an iPhone.
[01:35:57.689 --> 01:36:03.953]  It's very, very shameful if you don't have it as a demonstration piece to show people this was built by slaves.
[01:36:05.113 --> 01:36:07.575]  Political slaves that don't have a choice.
[01:36:08.757 --> 01:36:15.263]  And if you just paid $5 more for these, so they're trying to lower the price, so more poor people can get it, so they can de-industrialize further.
[01:36:15.283 --> 01:36:15.683]  You understand?
[01:36:15.723 --> 01:36:16.223]  And track you.
[01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:21.068]  If you just paid $5 more, they've got studies out, you can lift those people in China out of poverty.
[01:36:21.348 --> 01:36:23.029]  But there'll be no fair trade for iPhones.
[01:36:23.289 --> 01:36:24.931]  This is designed to destroy people.
[01:36:25.291 --> 01:36:28.094]  They want to kill people in the process of making these.
[01:36:28.594 --> 01:36:30.055]  That's because humans are bad.
[01:36:30.416 --> 01:36:33.878]  They're the enlightened globalists getting rid of the unwashed masses.
[01:36:33.939 --> 01:36:35.039]  They're saving the Earth.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:41.266]  While they use up the humans in the forced labor camps and preparing for the robots to replace them.
[01:36:41.526 --> 01:36:45.310]  And as soon as the robots are ready worldwide, France is going to get rid of their workers with them.
[01:36:46.151 --> 01:36:52.357]  China, the US, as soon as it's ready, as soon as the military is combat mech, the bioweapons will be released.
[01:36:53.738 --> 01:36:54.679]  Just prepare yourselves.
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:56.301]  This is the rollout.
[01:36:58.493 --> 01:37:01.675]  They're coming out with ground bulletproof combat robots for the U.S.
[01:37:02.096 --> 01:37:03.637]  I had that in a Wired magazine today.
[01:37:03.797 --> 01:37:04.177]  It's on.
[01:37:04.637 --> 01:37:05.058]  Our money.
[01:37:05.438 --> 01:37:05.838]  Built it.
[01:37:06.038 --> 01:37:07.339]  They're building the megafactories.
[01:37:07.379 --> 01:37:08.240]  They're building the grids.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:11.282]  They're just testing the grids with these baubles that surveil us.
[01:37:11.683 --> 01:37:14.064]  These are the smart meter control systems.
[01:37:14.485 --> 01:37:17.166]  Intel's announced all their chips will monitor all your...
[01:37:18.127 --> 01:37:18.647]  Appliances.
[01:37:18.667 --> 01:37:20.588]  We've got Steve Watson doing a story on this.
[01:37:20.648 --> 01:37:21.728]  Nobody else is covering this.
[01:37:21.949 --> 01:37:29.331]  They have a video they put out bragging, and it will monitor your house, whether you signed up for it or not, and it will turn your computer off if you're not using it.
[01:37:29.932 --> 01:37:33.013]  Just like the smart meters now are in California controlling thermostats.
[01:37:33.413 --> 01:37:34.613]  Remember, oh, they weren't going to do that.
[01:37:34.633 --> 01:37:35.554]  It was a conspiracy theory.
[01:37:35.734 --> 01:37:37.935]  Remember the old days when it was just crazy to talk like this?
[01:37:38.769 --> 01:37:40.689]  We're going to go to our guest here and then to your calls.
[01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:50.612]  Briefly, if you want to support the broadcast and get incredibly good products, it's a win-win, win-win, win-win-win scenario.
[01:37:51.732 --> 01:37:55.173]  Buy the ProPure water filters, the stainless-steel gravity-fed systems.
[01:37:55.633 --> 01:37:58.574]  You can get 10% off with promo code WATER at the already lowest price.
[01:37:59.034 --> 01:38:01.354]  Cuts out the glyphosates, the fluoride, all of it.
[01:38:01.394 --> 01:38:02.394]  It's just simply amazing.
[01:38:02.895 --> 01:38:04.035]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:06.223 --> 01:38:16.471]  The number one selling, destroys the competition, ProPure family, and there's a lot of other similar systems that are a lot less expensive but are still high quality that we also sell that are... These are very affordable.
[01:38:16.851 --> 01:38:18.032]  But we have some even more affordable.
[01:38:18.052 --> 01:38:20.093]  There's a bunch of great water filters, LifeStraw, you name it.
[01:38:20.474 --> 01:38:21.554]  InfowarsStore.com
[01:38:22.555 --> 01:38:27.376]  You get a great deal and you support true, independent, hardcore media that is focused and upset about what's happening.
[01:38:27.696 --> 01:38:30.317]  That's trying to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:38:30.677 --> 01:38:36.878]  Infowarsstore.com Infowarsstore.com or call toll free and tell them promo code water 888-253-3139.
[01:38:37.018 --> 01:38:38.419]  Those phones ring right here.
[01:38:38.439 --> 01:38:38.479]  888-253-3139.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:49.441]  Too many people call it rolls-over operators, but they're good folks, too.
[01:38:49.461 --> 01:38:50.561]  888-253-3139.
[01:38:50.581 --> 01:38:55.963]  The books, the films, the high-quality non-GMO seeds, all the stuff to be more self-sufficient.
[01:38:56.283 --> 01:39:01.044]  None of us are perfectly self-sufficient, but the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[01:39:01.384 --> 01:39:02.484]  Look at this graph I've got.
[01:39:02.805 --> 01:39:08.146]  Food stamp growth 75 times greater than job creation, and that's with government-cooked numbers.
[01:39:09.332 --> 01:39:10.513]  Weekly Standards got that.
[01:39:10.533 --> 01:39:12.334]  The graph's up on Infowars.com.
[01:39:13.014 --> 01:39:16.056]  And we can punch up my screen and I'll show folks this.
[01:39:16.076 --> 01:39:23.321]  14.7 million more people on food stamps compared to 194,000 new jobs created.
[01:39:23.361 --> 01:39:26.423]  And by the way, most of those are jobs created because everybody's going to part-time.
[01:39:26.843 --> 01:39:27.584]  Tens of millions.
[01:39:28.044 --> 01:39:29.905]  You're being told, oh sorry, no more 40 hours.
[01:39:29.925 --> 01:39:30.365]  You're down to 25.
[01:39:32.714 --> 01:39:34.236]  Or a lot of companies are just closing their doors.
[01:39:34.376 --> 01:39:35.217]  They're just like, hey, you know what?
[01:39:35.237 --> 01:39:35.557]  I'm done.
[01:39:35.577 --> 01:39:43.125]  In fact, most business people I talk to that are over 50, they go, man, I really had a passion, don't want to let my employees go, but I'm just sick of it.
[01:39:43.166 --> 01:39:44.787]  I'm leaving America and I'm shutting down.
[01:39:44.987 --> 01:39:46.349]  And they go and they say, bye, everybody.
[01:39:46.369 --> 01:39:49.993]  I mean, this is what happens in third world communist countries.
[01:39:50.033 --> 01:39:50.954]  We're now going into it.
[01:39:51.955 --> 01:39:52.936]  And the bankers know this.
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:55.381]  The corporations are all exempt from this.
[01:39:55.401 --> 01:39:57.021]  They're going to roll in and take over the economy.
[01:39:58.042 --> 01:39:59.223]  They know human nature.
[01:39:59.803 --> 01:40:08.987]  That's why people need to stay and work and keep people hired and do whatever you got to do to not comply, in my view, because the bankers are criminals.
[01:40:09.407 --> 01:40:11.508]  So at this point, it is a crime to comply.
[01:40:11.908 --> 01:40:15.730]  We comply because we're right in the middle of the crosshairs and that's not our battle.
[01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:17.311]  But I personally
[01:40:18.874 --> 01:40:21.795]  I personally, myself, am not complying at grocery stores.
[01:40:21.835 --> 01:40:24.417]  I'm personally sticking bumper stickers up on public things now.
[01:40:24.897 --> 01:40:27.078]  I'm personally walking up to cops I see and preaching at them.
[01:40:27.398 --> 01:40:29.199]  I'm personally getting really aggressive.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:30.300]  Okay?
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:30.960]  I mean, I'm doing it.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:31.320]  I am.
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:32.621]  But I cannot help it now.
[01:40:33.888 --> 01:40:37.729]  We've gotten in this position because we see like-minded Americans, and we talk to them.
[01:40:37.749 --> 01:40:39.310]  Average folks, we don't talk to them.
[01:40:39.490 --> 01:40:43.471]  If I'm jogging through a neighborhood, I'll stop and go, hey, you know about cancer viruses and vaccines?
[01:40:43.491 --> 01:40:46.392]  I know it sounds crazy, and if a guy's like, man, this is weird.
[01:40:46.432 --> 01:40:47.573]  I go, yeah, it's weird that I'm talking to you.
[01:40:47.793 --> 01:40:48.433]  Just look into it.
[01:40:48.653 --> 01:40:50.254]  Just search cancer viruses, vaccines.
[01:40:50.294 --> 01:40:50.674]  Promise me.
[01:40:50.994 --> 01:40:51.594]  All right, I'll do it.
[01:40:53.375 --> 01:40:55.115]  Two weeks later, was jogging, ran into the guy.
[01:40:55.235 --> 01:40:56.036]  He was like, I can't believe it.
[01:40:56.056 --> 01:40:56.456]  I looked it up.
[01:40:56.476 --> 01:40:56.776]  It's true.
[01:40:58.726 --> 01:41:03.950]  I've run into people now, years ago, who were pregnant and said, thank you for telling me not to have that vaccine.
[01:41:04.290 --> 01:41:12.876]  I looked it up and they lied to me and said there wasn't any additives and wasn't any side effects, but I got the insert after I had our little daughter, and it was true, and thank you so much.
[01:41:13.296 --> 01:41:16.458]  I've actually had them now run into people again that I've done that.
[01:41:16.498 --> 01:41:17.959]  It's not that I'm some goody two-shoes.
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.861]  I'm alive, folks.
[01:41:20.281 --> 01:41:20.962]  I'm angry.
[01:41:21.502 --> 01:41:23.764]  I know we're under attack by eugenicists.
[01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:27.066]  Somebody rolls their eyes at you, you know what you say to them?
[01:41:28.533 --> 01:41:30.434]  Oh, you know about injecting black people with syphilis.
[01:41:30.474 --> 01:41:32.575]  You know about sterilizing blow on their... Yeah, I know about that.
[01:41:32.755 --> 01:41:34.056]  Well, it's still going on right now.
[01:41:34.496 --> 01:41:35.056]  Look into it.
[01:41:36.196 --> 01:41:37.257]  People know now, though.
[01:41:37.477 --> 01:41:39.698]  It's gone from, oh, you're a kook to, yeah, yeah, you're right.
[01:41:41.319 --> 01:41:42.719]  Or they say, well, there's nothing I can do.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.400]  The answer is you can do something.
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:47.802]  Now, Veterans for Peace is a good organization.
[01:41:47.842 --> 01:41:51.343]  I would call them a real liberal organization.
[01:41:51.383 --> 01:41:52.404]  I've seen them do good work.
[01:41:53.456 --> 01:42:04.459]  Against war, and you know, not spend all their time promoting socialism, and I've known some Veterans for Peace people and found them to be quality folks, like Don Darling here in town, who was a nuclear submarine captain, friend of mine.
[01:42:04.479 --> 01:42:05.179]  I haven't had him on in years.
[01:42:05.199 --> 01:42:08.420]  I've got to check in on him and get him back on the show and get him in studio.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:13.282]  But Phil Restino is Veterans for Peace head in Central Florida, big chapter.
[01:42:13.542 --> 01:42:21.244]  He was friends with the late, great Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars program, Colonel Bowman, Dr. Bowman, nuclear physicist and chemical engineer, you name it.
[01:42:21.744 --> 01:42:25.425]  He died a few weeks ago after a decade-long battle with leukemia.
[01:42:26.125 --> 01:42:27.525]  Basically he had a form of blood cancer.
[01:42:29.445 --> 01:42:30.006]  Great guy.
[01:42:30.026 --> 01:42:31.966]  I remember he'd come in here and do interviews with us.
[01:42:32.406 --> 01:42:34.666]  He'd go out and immediately just lay down in his RV.
[01:42:34.686 --> 01:42:36.607]  I saw him last year he was here.
[01:42:36.627 --> 01:42:37.687]  He's going to be in Obama Deception 2.
[01:42:37.727 --> 01:42:38.987]  That's how long I've been working on this.
[01:42:39.907 --> 01:42:40.688]  But we don't have a lot of time.
[01:42:40.708 --> 01:42:41.928]  I appreciate Phil coming on.
[01:42:43.368 --> 01:42:46.809]  The head of the Veterans for Peace nationally
[01:42:48.769 --> 01:42:59.273]  Mike Finner has intervened for two years to keep Veterans for Peace National President Elliot Adams from sending the same letter to members of Congress calling for a resolution to impeach Obama.
[01:42:59.613 --> 01:43:04.035]  So it's not enough to just have all the Hollywood people and folks, you know, go, okay, Obama conned us.
[01:43:04.335 --> 01:43:06.036]  He's worse than Bush with the press.
[01:43:06.416 --> 01:43:08.197]  Worse than Bush on so many issues.
[01:43:08.897 --> 01:43:11.258]  Because he's more effective at evil.
[01:43:11.799 --> 01:43:20.884]  And so we must politically destroy him, even though he's a puppet to stop the agenda, to stop the wars, to stop the Syria starting that war, escalating that war.
[01:43:20.984 --> 01:43:25.387]  And so I want to commend Phil Restino, who I know is really active, because I see his work all the time.
[01:43:26.539 --> 01:43:28.622]  Out of all the veterans for peace people, he's very effective.
[01:43:28.862 --> 01:43:30.625]  Let's say a few words first about Bob Bowman.
[01:43:30.945 --> 01:43:37.754]  Then I want to get into, we have a clip of this, of the president of your group calling to go after Bush, but not Obama.
[01:43:39.096 --> 01:43:42.480]  You guys are an important, influential group with what you call the left.
[01:43:43.101 --> 01:43:49.844]  I would just call it the real left, not the authoritarian left, and trying to get an impeachment resolution going.
[01:43:50.505 --> 01:43:55.147]  Why is it all the libertarians doing that, not the Republican leadership or Democratic leadership?
[01:43:55.487 --> 01:43:56.888]  It shows how paid off they are.
[01:43:57.448 --> 01:43:59.449]  But Phil, good to have you on, joining us via Skype.
[01:44:00.436 --> 01:44:01.497]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[01:44:02.018 --> 01:44:04.821]  Thank you for the opportunity to get our story out today.
[01:44:05.521 --> 01:44:09.165]  And I've got so much to tell you, I can hardly wait to hear what it is.
[01:44:09.185 --> 01:44:19.296]  But you mentioned Bob Bowman, and if I could, whatever good comes from this interview, we'd like to dedicate it to Dr. Bob Bowman.
[01:44:19.957 --> 01:44:22.840]  And there's a couple of things I do have to clear up.
[01:44:23.701 --> 01:44:35.815]  Any criticism that I do have of Veterans for Peace and the anti-war organizations as a whole is because I believe in the Veterans for Peace Statement of Purpose.
[01:44:36.336 --> 01:44:42.163]  I believe in what they practiced, the principles they practiced during the Bush years.
[01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:44.063]  Which got me to join them.
[01:44:44.684 --> 01:44:49.785]  And as far as the president of Veterans for Peace, you mentioned Mike Ferner.
[01:44:49.825 --> 01:45:00.308]  He's a former president of Veterans for Peace, but he's the fellow that gave that fiery speech in 2005, which led me to join Veterans for Peace.
[01:45:01.028 --> 01:45:14.937]  And we did eventually pass a resolution in 2011 at the national level calling for Congress to impeach Obama for the same war crimes we cited in our call for impeaching Bush.
[01:45:15.738 --> 01:45:22.082]  And at that particular time, the president was Elliott Adams in 2011.
[01:45:22.442 --> 01:45:24.984]  Now, I don't know all that inside baseball.
[01:45:25.004 --> 01:45:26.785]  I'm just going off your letter you sent us.
[01:45:26.945 --> 01:45:30.368]  So bottom line, how do we get Veterans for Peace to take action?
[01:45:30.928 --> 01:45:37.810]  Well, right now, we have this article out on Activist Post, and I appreciate you folks taking note of it.
[01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:43.652]  It's called, Timeline to Veterans for Peaches, Vote to Impeach Obama 2009-2013.
[01:45:44.213 --> 01:45:50.735]  And if we could direct your audience to that article on activistpost.com.
[01:45:51.595 --> 01:45:53.696]  All the links and the whole story's there.
[01:45:54.797 --> 01:46:12.166]  But what we have is a resolution right now, two years later, which if it passes next month when the membership votes, it will force the current president, Patrick McCann of Veterans for Peace, to issue the same letter
[01:46:12.826 --> 01:46:19.110]  And deliver it to members of Congress as was done in 2005 for Bush.
[01:46:19.610 --> 01:46:24.473]  That has not been done for two years now since the resolution to impeach Obama passed in 2011.
[01:46:28.257 --> 01:46:40.860]  Well, again, I just think it's disgusting that he's been given the Peace Prize and that all the so-called lefties are really a bunch of authoritarians on the national stage, dancing around, going, nay, nay, boo-boo, our guy won.
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.581]  I was there criticizing Bush for all his warmongering.
[01:46:43.641 --> 01:46:44.541]  It's just disgusting.
[01:46:45.001 --> 01:46:50.663]  I can't see how all the so-called anti-war left, when we've got the government starting wars openly now,
[01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:56.290]  And overthrowing all these countries and just engaging in mass murder of Christians, you name it.
[01:46:56.870 --> 01:47:03.899]  And I don't hear anything out of the anti-war movement because it's just too trendy to love Barack Obama.
[01:47:04.932 --> 01:47:14.014]  Well, it's been a shame, and this is why we've been... There's a lot of us in the rank and file, Alex, that are never heard from.
[01:47:14.754 --> 01:47:23.336]  And that's why we're criticizing the national leadership, because that's what the impression the general public gets is from them.
[01:47:23.916 --> 01:47:27.877]  Unless you're active locally, and that's what your local community gets.
[01:47:28.277 --> 01:47:35.245]  But our chapter of Veterans for Peace, I don't think you could call us left or right.
[01:47:35.845 --> 01:47:38.008]  We just stick to the statement of purpose.
[01:47:38.588 --> 01:47:43.213]  And we had a good example in Bob Bowman being a member of our chapter.
[01:47:44.034 --> 01:47:47.398]  As you know, Bob Bowman during the last years of his life was
[01:47:47.558 --> 01:47:55.263]  Very strong on the art of getting out the word about the artificial divide of Americans between left and right.
[01:47:55.503 --> 01:48:00.886]  There's a great in studio interview you did with him back in July of 2009, which we made into a DVD.
[01:48:03.267 --> 01:48:08.470]  And his article of July 2010 called Left and Right Together.
[01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:16.454]  Your interview with him back then is entitled, America is artificially divided.
[01:48:17.374 --> 01:48:18.735]  And that's what we have here.
[01:48:18.895 --> 01:48:25.098]  And I believe that that is the biggest threat to our security in this country, is this divide.
[01:48:26.579 --> 01:48:30.102]  No, no, I agree with you, and it's because of that false left-right paradigm.
[01:48:30.122 --> 01:48:38.628]  It doesn't mean that on the so-called left and right there aren't real issue differences, but the system uses those terms just to get people not to work together.
[01:48:39.048 --> 01:48:39.789]  Exactly.
[01:48:39.909 --> 01:48:42.831]  And again, the so-called left, where are they?
[01:48:43.292 --> 01:48:48.275]  Criticizing Obama on the NDAA, on persecution of the press, on all of it.
[01:48:48.836 --> 01:48:51.138]  All Americans need to come together against this.
[01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:53.479]  And Obama needs to be impeached.
[01:48:53.979 --> 01:48:59.422]  Impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, just as Dennis Kucinich, you know, has now been critical of Obama.
[01:48:59.462 --> 01:49:03.423]  He got that Air Force One flight early on and suddenly supported Obama.
[01:49:03.924 --> 01:49:06.045]  I don't get why people sell out for red carpets.
[01:49:06.685 --> 01:49:09.526]  And, you know, sell out for feeling like they're part of the power structure.
[01:49:09.566 --> 01:49:11.767]  I mean, I wouldn't want to be on Air Force One.
[01:49:11.787 --> 01:49:13.568]  I wouldn't want to walk around on red carpets.
[01:49:13.628 --> 01:49:14.428]  It's embarrassing.
[01:49:14.829 --> 01:49:15.589]  It's pathetic.
[01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:19.491]  It's all delusional garbage and it'll all end up being dust.
[01:49:20.151 --> 01:49:23.993]  Speaking of Bob, when was the last time you had a chance to talk to him before he died?
[01:49:24.974 --> 01:49:26.335]  Just about a week or so.
[01:49:26.675 --> 01:49:31.158]  We took him to the VA down there in Vero Beach.
[01:49:32.218 --> 01:49:34.940]  It was a very good funeral service we had for him.
[01:49:37.101 --> 01:49:39.663]  I could go on for hours about Bob Bowman.
[01:49:40.724 --> 01:49:53.214]  But one thing you mentioned, and his wife Maggie, I spoke with her Sunday and she's looking forward to getting together with you at some point with family friend Russell Gentile.
[01:49:53.234 --> 01:49:56.357]  Yeah, we've invited her on the show.
[01:49:56.397 --> 01:49:59.700]  Family reached out and whoever, his daughter, whoever would like to get him on, yeah.
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:00.820]  It's tough.
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:06.522]  She just lost Bob and it's a process, but she does want to take you up on that invitation.
[01:50:07.842 --> 01:50:13.903]  But as far as the left and the right, it's really the problem here.
[01:50:14.003 --> 01:50:16.484]  And you mentioned Dennis Kucinich.
[01:50:17.604 --> 01:50:20.205]  When Obama bombed Libya,
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:33.588]  In 2011, March 19th, you had Professor Francis Boyle, who would be viewed as someone from the left, an international law professor who's actually prosecuted war criminals.
[01:50:33.608 --> 01:50:34.668]  Sure.
[01:50:34.908 --> 01:50:39.972]  And former Deputy Attorney General Bruce Fine, which would be considered the right.
[01:50:40.332 --> 01:50:48.517]  And then you had pundits left and right, you had members of Congress left and right, all calling for impeaching Obama for attacking Libya.
[01:50:48.857 --> 01:50:51.760]  Yet, the leadership of the anti-war movement was mute.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:53.942]  That's right, because they're really controlled opposition.
[01:50:54.283 --> 01:50:56.044]  CFLVeteransForPeace.org.
[01:50:56.305 --> 01:50:57.286]  Thanks for joining us, Phil.
[01:50:57.306 --> 01:50:58.206]  We'll be back with your calls.
[01:50:58.667 --> 01:51:00.409]  September is National Preparedness Month.
[01:51:00.549 --> 01:51:01.069]  That's right.
[01:51:01.169 --> 01:51:02.551]  We like to call it PrepTember.
[01:51:02.631 --> 01:51:05.594]  And there's no better place to get prepped than with emergency essentials.
[01:51:05.894 --> 01:51:06.835]  We're good to go.
[01:51:29.033 --> 01:51:36.935]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.
[01:51:37.275 --> 01:51:40.956]  Stay one step ahead of hackers and Big Brother with a BlockIt Pocket.
[01:51:41.256 --> 01:51:46.597]  A custom-made pocket infused with pure silver that creates a complete Faraday enclosure for your cell phone.

[01:51:51.298 --> 01:51:52.219]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:51:59.941]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:52:00.201 --> 01:52:03.702]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:52:03.842 --> 01:52:08.244]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:52:08.404 --> 01:52:14.366]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:52:14.486 --> 01:52:25.270]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:31.775]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:52:31.975 --> 01:52:46.706]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[01:52:56.811 --> 01:53:05.516]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[01:53:06.076 --> 01:53:09.157]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[01:53:09.778 --> 01:53:15.581]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[01:53:16.445 --> 01:53:26.997]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[01:53:27.678 --> 01:53:31.842]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[01:53:32.583 --> 01:53:40.727]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[01:53:41.247 --> 01:53:44.689]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[01:53:45.089 --> 01:53:47.070]  It's something much darker.
[01:53:47.550 --> 01:53:52.852]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[01:53:53.232 --> 01:53:54.573]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[01:54:09.855 --> 01:54:10.575]  We're back, folks.
[01:54:10.796 --> 01:54:11.796]  Going to your phone calls.
[01:54:11.876 --> 01:54:13.317]  Dr. Jerome Corsi coming up.
[01:54:14.818 --> 01:54:17.219]  Here's some of the headlines up on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.781]  Americans complain of soaring Obamacare costs.
[01:54:19.801 --> 01:54:23.323]  They're now hitting, even though it officially kicks in in five days.
[01:54:23.884 --> 01:54:26.925]  Record gun sales in Maryland as tyrannical law looms.
[01:54:28.286 --> 01:54:31.648]  Democrat delegates push for bill for gun confiscation.
[01:54:31.688 --> 01:54:32.549]  They're open about it.
[01:54:32.569 --> 01:54:34.430]  Wherever they get control, they take the guns.
[01:54:34.890 --> 01:54:37.332]  All lying and saying, we don't want your guns, we don't want your guns.
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:40.180]  They are a criminal intellect, folks.
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:41.101]  You need to understand that.
[01:54:41.681 --> 01:54:43.901]  Senator warns Obama not to implement U.N.
[01:54:44.061 --> 01:54:44.621]  arms treaty.
[01:54:44.741 --> 01:54:46.542]  Obama says they're going to sign it anyways.
[01:54:47.402 --> 01:54:50.362]  Al Qaeda rejects CIA's national coalition in Syria.
[01:54:50.382 --> 01:54:51.923]  They want full command of the forces.
[01:54:52.863 --> 01:54:55.843]  Leftists who cheered abortion filibuster slam Ted Cruz.
[01:54:55.863 --> 01:54:59.144]  And we've got another article breaking down things by Mike Adams.
[01:54:59.204 --> 01:55:01.364]  Why is Obamacare so unaffordable?
[01:55:02.044 --> 01:55:04.345]  Another California county votes for secession.
[01:55:05.507 --> 01:55:09.348]  Cyprus-style wealth confiscation is now starting to happen all over the world.
[01:55:09.388 --> 01:55:20.371]  I want to bring that up because he's a financial expert with Corsi as well, though we've got him on about censorship now of the interview we did Monday on YouTube, and I knew that would happen, about Obama funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:21.051 --> 01:55:24.212]  I mean, they just are really afraid of how we put things.
[01:55:24.572 --> 01:55:31.434]  I can always tell when a video doesn't have outrageous claims but is really effective and hardcore.
[01:55:32.295 --> 01:55:33.235]  I always know.
[01:55:34.565 --> 01:55:43.430]  Well, I also learned, one time we showed a clip of the Skeksis dying in the Dark Crystal when the Saudi King had died and we made a joke out of it and they took it down.
[01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:49.133]  YouTube put a strike on us and said that was offensive to show a clip of a Disney movie of a dying emperor.
[01:55:49.813 --> 01:55:51.934]  But if you can't lampoon public figures, who can you?
[01:55:52.354 --> 01:55:55.636]  And it's because these people throw their money around and they want to make America authoritarian.
[01:55:57.421 --> 01:56:02.682]  You got all these lobbying interests that make their money out of criminal government, who are here lobbying to take our freedom.
[01:56:02.922 --> 01:56:05.743]  And the Saudi Arabians are right in the middle of it, and I'm sick of it.
[01:56:07.163 --> 01:56:08.644]  I am sick and tired of it.
[01:56:11.504 --> 01:56:16.186]  So, there's gonna be a lot more talking about the Saudi Royal Family, and a lot more coverage here.
[01:56:17.306 --> 01:56:20.867]  If you start trying to push us around, you're gonna get a doubling down, punks.
[01:56:23.607 --> 01:56:26.128]  Chad in Kentucky, you're on the air, go ahead, welcome.
[01:56:27.486 --> 01:56:27.866]  Thank you.
[01:56:27.946 --> 01:56:41.013]  Yeah, I just want to say, you know, when Obama goes to bed at night and, you know, all our ambassadors get killed over in Benghazi, and you've got Ted Cruz that stands up there and will, you know, preach about the Constitution, is actually talking about this tyrannical government.
[01:56:41.374 --> 01:56:44.796]  He's talking about, you know, all sorts of other things that are going on.
[01:56:45.316 --> 01:56:54.561]  You know, everyone's starting to wake up, and these politicians know that, and that's why they're kind of going on both sides right now, and it's either on your side of liberty or the, you know, the side of tyranny.
[01:56:55.074 --> 01:57:00.439]  I mean, Petraeus can't even go out in public, McCain can't even go out in public anymore, and you've talked about this before.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:05.503]  Well, that's right, and the neocons and the Democrats are all in this together at the top.
[01:57:05.643 --> 01:57:07.805]  It's liberty versus tyranny.
[01:57:07.905 --> 01:57:09.887]  It's libertarian versus authoritarian.
[01:57:11.305 --> 01:57:13.867]  That's the choice that we all have right now.
[01:57:14.447 --> 01:57:20.731]  And the system's gone from, oh, the Tea Party doesn't have any power, to they're running things, to everybody loves Obamacare.
[01:57:20.751 --> 01:57:22.973]  Like, all right, we know you don't like it, but it doesn't matter.
[01:57:23.633 --> 01:57:26.615]  Because now they know that they're in trouble.
[01:57:27.215 --> 01:57:30.437]  And I'm just concerned about what they're going to pull to change the subject.
[01:57:30.777 --> 01:57:36.301]  And I predict bigger mass shootings they're going to stage and new Oklahoma City bombings they're going to blame on us.
[01:57:37.179 --> 01:57:38.359]  And they've already done it a bunch to me.
[01:57:38.399 --> 01:57:41.280]  They blamed the Boston bombing on me because I pointed out they were behind it.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:47.101]  They now say on CNN and MSNBC that I made them bomb with no proof.
[01:57:47.961 --> 01:57:50.542]  Now why do you think they'll come out and say things like that?
[01:57:50.582 --> 01:57:55.082]  That Alex Jones and Libertarians are why the Czarnev brothers bombed.
[01:57:56.083 --> 01:57:58.143]  Why do you think they say that with no proof?
[01:57:58.183 --> 01:58:01.224]  Because we are the high noon to these vampires.
[01:58:01.524 --> 01:58:02.664]  Do you see what I'm saying, Chad?
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.021]  Oh yeah, I definitely agree.
[01:58:05.601 --> 01:58:13.104]  I think that they're, you know, they know that they either have to hurry up and close the door on us because so many people are waking up, or we're going to wake up and put them all in jail.
[01:58:14.104 --> 01:58:14.965]  And now with this U.N.
[01:58:15.025 --> 01:58:23.308]  arms treaty that carries about the sign today, which I heard can be implemented as soon as Wednesday, and you put that together with their October surprise, you never know what's going to happen.
[01:58:24.148 --> 01:58:26.069]  They're going to go shoot up shopping malls and schools.
[01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:30.591]  They'll send in a black op team and have some drugged up person they're shooting at they blame it on.
[01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:33.605]  I mean, they might kill 500 kids next time.
[01:58:33.645 --> 01:58:34.765]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:58:34.785 --> 01:58:36.506]  We'll be right back.

[01:59:51.546 --> 01:59:53.467]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:00:15.401 --> 02:00:19.463]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:24.284]  Alright, Dr. Jerome Corsi is coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:24.464 --> 02:00:27.208]  Breaking and InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:27.608 --> 02:00:31.694]  Media lumps in whistleblowers with mass murderers.
[02:00:32.435 --> 02:00:35.779]  Time Magazine says Edward Snowden equals Aaron Alexis.
[02:00:35.839 --> 02:00:36.740]  It actually says that.
[02:00:37.481 --> 02:00:39.562]  Well, nobody really reads Time Magazine anymore.
[02:00:39.962 --> 02:00:41.182]  That's what you guys don't get.
[02:00:41.282 --> 02:00:44.403]  You have really dropped the ball now.
[02:00:44.563 --> 02:00:48.504]  People are not buying in to what you have to say and what you stand for.
[02:00:49.184 --> 02:00:50.865]  And if we can, punch it up on screen.
[02:00:50.905 --> 02:00:58.107]  I'll show people the actual Time Magazine article that's out in the new issue.
[02:00:59.647 --> 02:01:01.008]  It says, Before Snowden.
[02:01:02.028 --> 02:01:11.217]  Historic turncoats, intelligence moles, aiding the enemy, murderers, Soviet spies, and there they are.
[02:01:12.478 --> 02:01:22.929]  You're now a Soviet spy, you're now a murderer, you're now a bomber, if you expose the government committing crime.
[02:01:23.650 --> 02:01:24.871]  What a group of crooks.
[02:01:28.223 --> 02:01:29.063]  that this system is.
[02:01:29.103 --> 02:01:37.665]  And look, they've got Snowden right next to Aaron Alexis and Bradley Manning or Chelsea Manning or Randy Manning, what's his name now?
[02:01:39.205 --> 02:01:40.045]  Chelsea Manning.
[02:01:41.105 --> 02:01:45.266]  But Major Nadal Hassan, they don't call that terrorism, they blame that on gun owners.
[02:01:45.926 --> 02:01:48.987]  So there you go, Snowden's with a guy that attacked a military base.
[02:01:49.387 --> 02:01:52.067]  Totally disgusting showing the yellow journalism.
[02:01:52.467 --> 02:01:54.047]  New level of yellow journalism.
[02:01:54.327 --> 02:01:56.548]  Let's go to Bill here on the air.
[02:01:56.808 --> 02:01:57.228]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:01:58.462 --> 02:02:00.183]  Alex, pleasure to talk to you.
[02:02:01.764 --> 02:02:10.128]  It's a breath of fresh air to finally see politicians who actually stand, and could you imagine Obama standing for 21 hours?
[02:02:10.528 --> 02:02:17.572]  I can imagine him partying at a Jay-Z thing and snorting cocaine and smoking packs of cigarettes, or I can imagine Hillary.
[02:02:18.192 --> 02:02:21.234]  I had a 21-hour lesbian orgy, but I can't.
[02:02:21.254 --> 02:02:22.395]  I mean, that's all public now.
[02:02:22.455 --> 02:02:23.075]  We always knew it.
[02:02:23.375 --> 02:02:26.297]  I can imagine Bill Clinton biting and raping women for 24 hours.
[02:02:26.697 --> 02:02:28.258]  That's what he does, is bite them.
[02:02:28.999 --> 02:02:30.860]  He holds them down while he bites them and rapes them.
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:32.521]  He's settled in court on that.
[02:02:32.601 --> 02:02:40.926]  So, yeah, I can imagine him actually raping women for 24 hours or shorting cocaine, but I can't imagine him eloquently speaking on liberty as a statesman.
[02:02:41.886 --> 02:02:42.387]  Why do you ask?
[02:02:43.682 --> 02:02:46.543]  It's just a complete breath of fresh air.
[02:02:46.603 --> 02:02:52.765]  I did not think that there was anybody left in the Republican Party that would stand on their principles.
[02:02:52.845 --> 02:02:57.567]  They usually bend and flutter in the wind as soon as they get up to Washington.
[02:02:57.647 --> 02:02:58.827]  It's really good.
[02:02:58.887 --> 02:03:07.530]  Hopefully, we can keep supporting them and keep our eye on them and keep pressuring them and get them to keep going.
[02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:08.630]  Well, that's right.
[02:03:08.931 --> 02:03:11.292]  Rand Paul is able to do this because he has massive support.
[02:03:11.332 --> 02:03:12.252]  So is Ted Cruz.
[02:03:12.412 --> 02:03:15.134]  And they're now the example for a whole new generation.
[02:03:15.834 --> 02:03:21.417]  And by the way, at internal Democratic Party fundraisers with Obama and Reid and the Vice President Biden.
[02:03:22.876 --> 02:03:29.963]  Joe Biden, as they call him, Mr. Shotgun, they're panicking and stuff that they don't want to get out, going, we're in trouble, the Tea Party's the enemy.
[02:03:30.184 --> 02:03:32.686]  That's why they're on the news going, racist killers!
[02:03:33.067 --> 02:03:34.488]  Jones is a bomber!
[02:03:34.668 --> 02:03:35.709]  Arrest them!
[02:03:36.090 --> 02:03:37.932]  They're like, shut them up!
[02:03:38.072 --> 02:03:39.353]  Shut them up now!
[02:03:40.494 --> 02:03:42.997]  We don't want them to know about Hillary and all her girlfriends!
[02:03:43.177 --> 02:03:43.898]  Shut him up!
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:47.882]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:03:47.982 --> 02:03:49.983]  And again, we've known about Hillary and her girlfriends forever.
[02:03:50.003 --> 02:03:55.928]  It's just the whole point is it just shows how... I mean, when they ordered the hit on the ambassador, he went to the Jay-Z concert.
[02:03:56.348 --> 02:03:59.791]  It wasn't that he went to the Jay-Z thing, a private Jay-Z deal, and didn't care.
[02:04:00.951 --> 02:04:03.894]  That's how you run, you know, a mafia game.
[02:04:04.634 --> 02:04:06.996]  Oh, the ambassador's sending cables back?
[02:04:07.456 --> 02:04:11.359]  They don't want to give heat-seeking missiles to Al-Qaeda that were shipped down there by the State Department?
[02:04:11.799 --> 02:04:12.200]  Well, listen.
[02:04:13.339 --> 02:04:15.721]  Looks like just turn the security force loose on them.
[02:04:17.003 --> 02:04:17.804]  I'm gonna go party.
[02:04:19.786 --> 02:04:20.807]  Anything else to say there?
[02:04:21.739 --> 02:04:35.922]  Yeah, on Fox News on Sunday, the past Sunday, I haven't heard you mention it, Jesse Trudeau was on and he had got a hold of a document that states, right there in the document, that two suspects pull up in a Ryder truck.
[02:04:37.342 --> 02:04:41.443]  Three minutes, six seconds later, two suspects exit the truck.
[02:04:43.043 --> 02:04:45.524]  They declared national security in the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:46.684]  FBI agents went public.
[02:04:47.264 --> 02:04:51.507]  McVeigh with the other federal agents all there, including high-level FBI agents.
[02:04:51.887 --> 02:04:52.868]  We've talked to the witnesses.
[02:04:52.888 --> 02:04:54.188]  They all saw him wire the bombs.
[02:04:54.989 --> 02:04:56.270]  They told him it was a drill, of course.
[02:04:58.553 --> 02:05:00.194]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:05:00.454 --> 02:05:03.956]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:08.499]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:05:08.639 --> 02:05:14.623]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:05:14.763 --> 02:05:25.529]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.

[02:06:58.383 --> 02:07:02.004]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:07:02.245 --> 02:07:07.527]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:07:07.767 --> 02:07:15.309]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:07:15.490 --> 02:07:24.593]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:07:24.793 --> 02:07:31.819]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:07:31.959 --> 02:07:34.841]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:07:34.861 --> 02:07:41.767]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[02:07:42.367 --> 02:07:43.368]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:07:43.388 --> 02:07:44.610]  Another plane just hit!
[02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:02.469]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:03.430]  A lie!
[02:08:03.870 --> 02:08:05.570]  No man is obsolete!
[02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:07.691]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:08:07.751 --> 02:08:10.612]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[02:08:10.972 --> 02:08:16.073]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[02:08:16.433 --> 02:08:18.074]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:08:18.114 --> 02:08:19.194]  A crawling insect!
[02:08:19.874 --> 02:08:23.677]  Ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[02:08:24.278 --> 02:08:25.398]  I am a human being!
[02:08:25.779 --> 02:08:33.004]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[02:08:33.545 --> 02:08:34.245]  I don't care!
[02:08:34.665 --> 02:08:35.746]  I tell you, I don't care!
[02:08:36.247 --> 02:08:37.087]  I'm a human being!
[02:08:37.287 --> 02:08:37.768]  I exist!
[02:08:38.863 --> 02:08:44.486]  If I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[02:08:44.986 --> 02:08:47.687]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:08:48.147 --> 02:08:55.570]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[02:08:55.831 --> 02:09:01.173]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your pride!
[02:09:02.873 --> 02:09:06.377]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:09:06.978 --> 02:09:08.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:09:27.475 --> 02:09:30.037]  All right, I appreciate him coming on on short notice.
[02:09:30.077 --> 02:09:36.561]  He is a best-selling author and one of the head researchers over at WorldNetDaily.com.
[02:09:36.601 --> 02:09:40.764]  He's a frequent contributor to our radio and TV show here at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:41.264 --> 02:09:45.687]  Dr. Jerome Corsi received his PhD from Harvard University in political science at 72.
[02:09:46.228 --> 02:09:48.389]  He's currently senior staff reporter for WorldNetDaily.
[02:09:48.929 --> 02:09:50.290]  He's also an investigative reporter.
[02:09:50.370 --> 02:09:56.735]  He's written a bunch of number one best-selling New York Times political books that have changed the outcome of elections.
[02:09:57.595 --> 02:10:08.586]  And I want to have him with us here today to get into Ted Cruz, the Libertarian Conservative Revolution, the Gallup Poll showing all-time no trust in government, and so much more.
[02:10:09.227 --> 02:10:19.817]  But Dr. Courtsey, you were on Monday, and maybe one out of, let's not, it's got to be 500 videos get censored by YouTube.
[02:10:20.598 --> 02:10:22.320]  And YouTube's a large part of our outreach.
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.223]  We've reached conservatively with our channels.
[02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:26.926]  500 million people just with our channels.
[02:10:26.946 --> 02:10:29.008]  We've got 330-something million on one channel.
[02:10:29.709 --> 02:10:33.734]  We have films that get seen 20, 30, 40 million times on other folks' channels.
[02:10:34.575 --> 02:10:36.898]  So it's an important outreach to people that don't listen to talk radio.
[02:10:38.092 --> 02:10:56.645]  And every time I talk about Saudi Arabia funding terrorism, which is on record, every time I talk about Obama connected to funding terrorism, we're seeing censorship, they have blocked the video on my smartphone and other smartphones, and on regular computers it says, breaking, Obama linked to Kenyan mall massacre revealed.
[02:10:56.985 --> 02:11:07.252]  And we show all the links and the history and Odinga and being with the radical Muslims and Obama funding the Muslim Brotherhood out of Kenya that you wrote about a month ago and it's in the Egyptian press.
[02:11:08.232 --> 02:11:10.194]  So I want to give you the floor for the eight minutes.
[02:11:10.254 --> 02:11:15.178]  I'm not going to interrupt you until we go to break, because I want to hear what you really have to say, because you always bring up so much.
[02:11:15.238 --> 02:11:16.459]  It makes me bring up other points.
[02:11:16.479 --> 02:11:17.700]  I'm going to give you the floor, sir.
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:18.941]  OK?
[02:11:19.281 --> 02:11:25.726]  And to go over this type of censorship we're seeing and any new developments that are unfolding.
[02:11:25.746 --> 02:11:33.412]  Then we'll go to break, then we're going to come back, and we're going to go into some of the other things that are happening politically.
[02:11:33.432 --> 02:11:34.373]  But Dr. Corsi, go ahead.
[02:11:34.893 --> 02:11:43.575]  Well, the main links here are that Kenya, of course, which is what Obama claims is the country of his father.
[02:11:44.415 --> 02:11:54.918]  Obama, going back to Odinga, who is the Luo tribe member, as Obama's family was Luo tribe, in the run-up to the election in 2007,
[02:11:56.858 --> 02:11:58.839]  Obama and Odinga were close.
[02:11:58.899 --> 02:12:06.123]  Obama was in Kenya in 2006 before he ran for election and made contact with Odinga.
[02:12:06.243 --> 02:12:07.724]  Odinga signed an agreement.
[02:12:08.845 --> 02:12:19.891]  It was first a secret agreement that was brought forward to the public in Kenya with radical Islamists in Kenya saying that if they would support Odinga he would
[02:12:21.332 --> 02:12:34.197]  Sway the government to accommodate Islamist interests and would work with his new constitution to put increasingly Kenya under Sharia law.
[02:12:34.798 --> 02:12:37.319]  Well, the Odinga did not win the election.
[02:12:38.019 --> 02:12:44.082]  And as part of the plan that had been discussed with Obama, and I documented that back in the 2004, going forward, 2008 election,
[02:12:49.901 --> 02:12:55.703]  That Obama and Odinga were going to have this violence, which Odinga had.
[02:12:55.743 --> 02:12:58.904]  The Luo tribe members rose up against the Kikuyu.
[02:12:59.464 --> 02:13:00.364]  People were killed.
[02:13:02.005 --> 02:13:04.906]  Christians were burned in churches in Kenya.
[02:13:06.046 --> 02:13:08.829]  Obama did not condemn the violence.
[02:13:09.309 --> 02:13:14.814]  He used the violence to advance the career of Odinga.
[02:13:15.275 --> 02:13:16.416]  Kofi Annan entered.
[02:13:16.536 --> 02:13:19.939]  Odinga became co-head of state with President Kibaki.
[02:13:19.979 --> 02:13:21.480]  He became prime minister.
[02:13:22.121 --> 02:13:24.162]  And then the rolling forward
[02:13:25.043 --> 02:13:28.526]  When Obama is President, we're putting all kinds of foreign aid into Kenya.
[02:13:28.567 --> 02:13:30.108]  We are actually using U.S.
[02:13:30.228 --> 02:13:49.247]  public money, taxpayer money, to fund the Constitution passing, this new Constitution pressed by Odinga, which opens up, again, Kenya to Sharia law, which invites in various Islamic factions.
[02:13:49.747 --> 02:13:52.150]  Islamic factions are coming in from Somalia.
[02:13:52.610 --> 02:13:55.334]  These are welcomed in by Odinga.
[02:13:56.074 --> 02:14:00.259]  And the radical Islamic presence in Kenya begins to build.
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:04.384]  At the same time, Malik Obama, who is the brother
[02:14:05.373 --> 02:14:16.321]  The half-brother of Barack Obama in Kenya emerges and he is managing money for the Egyptian Brotherhood, for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[02:14:17.162 --> 02:14:26.049]  And the Egyptian government comes out and they say they're going to prosecute, there have been criminal charges filed against Malik for running terrorist money.
[02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:31.153]  Now the Muslim Brotherhood is actually illegal, condemned within Egypt,
[02:14:31.673 --> 02:14:37.295]  There's a number of Muslim Brotherhood members in prison, going to a weight trial.
[02:14:37.915 --> 02:14:49.920]  The government, this new government, the military government, has announced that they will reveal the links of Obama, President in the White House, supporting through his brother Malik.
[02:14:50.956 --> 02:14:58.019]  The Muslim Brotherhood interests in radical Islam throughout Egypt, throughout North Africa, and into Kenya.
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:11.466]  Malik also manages the Islamic Dawah Fund, which is a North Sudanese fund, another terrorist fund, for the president of that country, Bashar, who is
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:18.364]  Under a criminal indictment by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for genocide.
[02:15:18.404 --> 02:15:21.205]  And Malik Obama has these deep ties.
[02:15:21.245 --> 02:15:34.994]  He's running a fraudulent 501c3 in the United States, named after his brother, the Barack H. Obama Foundation, that Lois Lerner gave a retroactive determination letter that it was a tax
[02:15:35.974 --> 02:15:40.577]  Free organization, tax-exempt organization.
[02:15:40.877 --> 02:15:45.519]  And now Obama has signed orders two weeks ago to openly arm terrorists.
[02:15:45.979 --> 02:15:50.202]  He's so evil and so gangster and so corrupt and getting away with everything.
[02:15:50.222 --> 02:15:58.066]  I can't even believe it's gotten this wild and that he actually, for all intents and purposes, Obama is the head of Al-Qaeda worldwide.
[02:15:58.446 --> 02:15:59.126]  Well, I've said that.
[02:15:59.146 --> 02:16:01.508]  I've said basically we are Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:02.188 --> 02:16:04.210]  People have got to understand, we've become Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:10.675]  The United States has been funding Al-Qaeda, certainly since before Gaddafi fell.
[02:16:11.435 --> 02:16:20.763]  What we were doing with Benghazi, because remember Ambassador Stevens came into Libya through Benghazi before we had diplomatic relations with Libya.
[02:16:21.463 --> 02:16:26.946]  And what he was doing was working with the Al-Qaeda factions, radical Islamic factions.
[02:16:27.606 --> 02:16:30.388]  The Obama administration was arming these factions.
[02:16:30.468 --> 02:16:36.251]  We were producing weapons so they could oppose and depose Qaddafi.
[02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:43.455]  Once Qaddafi was deposed and the radical Al-Qaeda forces took over Libya,
[02:16:44.936 --> 02:16:47.538]  And now Ambassador Stevens is ambassador.
[02:16:47.998 --> 02:17:00.309]  He's again in Benghazi and we're running guns now from Libya to Al-Qaeda and the jihadis and sending terrorists from Libya via Turkey and arms.
[02:17:01.090 --> 02:17:12.059]  into Syria, where we're backing the Al Qaeda forces again, just as we back the Muslim Brotherhood forces throughout Northern Africa.
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:15.362]  And again, these are all radical jihadist factors.
[02:17:15.782 --> 02:17:25.290]  The Muslim Brotherhood is now outlawed as a criminal terrorist organization in Egypt, and President Obama was solidly behind the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:26.951]  That's the story.
[02:17:27.011 --> 02:17:27.552]  It's all true.
[02:17:29.728 --> 02:17:53.929]  And when you say we're behind Al Qaeda, obviously criminal elements in the government centered around Obama, and it goes back before that, but why would they calculate to stir up a Sunni-Shiite civil war across the Middle East, offensively with the West committing war crimes, arming Al Qaeda, to start the fight under common law and international law, that is a war crime,
[02:17:55.050 --> 02:17:57.532]  And how do they think they're going to get away with this?
[02:17:58.153 --> 02:18:06.999]  And now you have spectacles, like the head of Al-Nusra, who's also the head of Al-Qaeda, coming out two weeks ago and saying, attack soft targets, and now they're doing it.
[02:18:07.519 --> 02:18:11.863]  And then Obama's half-brother is involved funding these groups, and it's public.
[02:18:11.943 --> 02:18:15.185]  I mean, I just can't believe how naked they are.
[02:18:15.425 --> 02:18:16.746]  They're not even trying to hide it.
[02:18:17.047 --> 02:18:18.328]  I mean, Reagan arming
[02:18:19.088 --> 02:18:22.030]  The Contras was nothing compared to this.
[02:18:22.090 --> 02:18:25.173]  I mean, how do they, why are they so arrogant?
[02:18:25.553 --> 02:18:27.595]  Well, because again, follow the money.
[02:18:28.195 --> 02:18:30.997]  The interests being served here are Saudi Arabia.
[02:18:31.698 --> 02:18:35.921]  And Obama's serving Saudi Arabia's interests, lying to the American public.
[02:18:36.301 --> 02:18:37.943]  Another CIA set of lies.
[02:18:37.983 --> 02:18:41.806]  Look who's in charge of the CIA, John Brennan.
[02:18:42.446 --> 02:18:50.252]  John Brennan's intelligence firm, before Obama was president, sanitized Obama's passport records.
[02:18:50.312 --> 02:18:57.358]  The two employees for Brennan who did it were not reprimanded, fired, their names weren't even released.
[02:18:58.179 --> 02:19:03.663]  And then Brennan emerges as National Security Advisor in the White House and now he's elevated to head of the CIA.
[02:19:04.364 --> 02:19:06.705]  The only benefit here is that
[02:19:07.646 --> 02:19:27.859]  Saudi Arabia wants to destabilize the Middle East in favor of Sunni radical groups that can oppose the Shiites in Iran and any forces tied to the Shiites like Assad in Syria.
[02:19:28.539 --> 02:19:30.480]  And the reason for this is oil.
[02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:32.000]  It's money in oil.
[02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:35.181]  Saudi Arabia wants to keep the price of oil high.
[02:19:35.201 --> 02:19:36.721]  They don't want any competition.
[02:19:36.761 --> 02:19:39.302]  They want the United States serving their oil efforts.
[02:19:39.362 --> 02:19:39.682]  That's right.
[02:19:39.702 --> 02:19:40.362]  Dr. Corsi, stay there.
[02:19:40.382 --> 02:19:41.043]  We're going to come back.
[02:19:41.123 --> 02:19:44.844]  I want to segue with you into domestic politics.
[02:19:44.864 --> 02:19:47.124]  Obama is clearly crashing and burning.
[02:19:47.184 --> 02:19:48.085]  He's sinking right now.
[02:19:49.125 --> 02:19:51.007]  The American people are turning on the whole system.
[02:19:51.387 --> 02:19:54.029]  What will they pull to try to get out of this?
[02:19:54.089 --> 02:19:56.371]  Because I can just feel the false flag coming.
[02:19:56.832 --> 02:19:58.413]  We'll talk to an expert straight ahead.
[02:19:59.033 --> 02:20:02.516]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.

[02:20:11.604 --> 02:20:16.867]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[02:20:17.207 --> 02:20:17.688]  It's true!
[02:20:17.928 --> 02:20:19.769]  And he can email you the test results.

[02:20:59.307 --> 02:21:03.630]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:09.414]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:09.514 --> 02:21:11.615]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[02:21:11.675 --> 02:21:12.856]  No word about IRAs.

[02:21:45.781 --> 02:21:47.102]  Ben Franklin said it best.
[02:21:47.302 --> 02:21:49.624]  By failing to prepare, you're preparing to fail.

[02:22:58.928 --> 02:23:03.069]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[02:23:03.369 --> 02:23:10.112]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[02:23:10.592 --> 02:23:14.434]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[02:23:14.874 --> 02:23:16.674]  Fortunately, there is something you can do about it.

[02:24:04.042 --> 02:24:06.684]  This is the end.
[02:24:06.964 --> 02:24:10.568]  Beautiful friend.
[02:24:10.828 --> 02:24:11.869]  This is the end.
[02:24:13.659 --> 02:24:17.341]  ...of the establishment's credibility, so they're going right to authoritarianism.
[02:24:18.361 --> 02:24:24.865]  And I have been censored, or they've attempted to censor me, over and over again when I criticize Saudi Arabia.
[02:24:25.445 --> 02:24:29.887]  And I guess that's because they're, on record, being very authoritarian, buying up a lot of U.S.
[02:24:29.927 --> 02:24:34.309]  companies and media, putting a large position in News Corp, Hollywood, you name it.
[02:24:35.430 --> 02:24:41.093]  And there's a lot of other power groups as well, but Saudi Arabia would love to turn America into a police state.
[02:24:42.103 --> 02:24:44.828]  That is their ruling power structure.
[02:24:44.868 --> 02:24:48.013]  And Dr. Corsi, again, they're censoring our interview.
[02:24:48.574 --> 02:24:49.595]  I'd like to send that to you.
[02:24:49.615 --> 02:24:50.877]  Perhaps you can do a blurb on it.
[02:24:51.358 --> 02:24:53.341]  Because you so eloquently in 20 minutes
[02:24:54.660 --> 02:24:55.100]  I don't know.
[02:25:13.368 --> 02:25:14.569]  And it's broken English, too.
[02:25:14.969 --> 02:25:19.832]  I guess they have brigades, like many other countries do, of kind of their citizen little princelings.
[02:25:19.852 --> 02:25:21.493]  There's tens of thousands of them, and they're minions.
[02:25:22.014 --> 02:25:28.037]  I guess they're harems of kidnapped women from the West or whatever, attacking me right now in broken English.
[02:25:28.458 --> 02:25:29.659]  It's pretty disgusting.
[02:25:30.099 --> 02:25:33.241]  What else should I expect for daring to talk bad about Saudi Arabia?
[02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:37.461]  Well, I mean, all kinds of investigations of one kind or another, that's possible.
[02:25:38.482 --> 02:25:44.064]  Any kind of surveillance that could be done, they'll do a whole variety of things.
[02:25:44.144 --> 02:25:47.885]  I mean, I'm sure all the taxes have been looked at for sure.
[02:25:47.905 --> 02:25:49.466]  They've probably had all kinds of audits.
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:57.622]  But you know, the control over the investments, it's always important to look at the money.
[02:25:58.582 --> 02:26:09.324]  And if you want to take a fundamental look at our Middle Eastern strategy, and especially the Obama administration with regards to terrorism, it's dictated out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:26:10.044 --> 02:26:16.846]  That the whole destabilization, we had very stable regimes with Mubarak,
[02:26:17.586 --> 02:26:19.469]  We had stable regimes with Gaddafi.
[02:26:20.010 --> 02:26:27.461]  They may not have been, you know, the best in terms of human rights, but there are very little in that region that is the best in human rights.
[02:26:27.661 --> 02:26:31.487]  All the churches weren't being blown up and Christians weren't being crucified down the road.
[02:26:32.236 --> 02:26:36.498]  And, uh, the destabilization was in favor, began with the Arab Spring.
[02:26:37.298 --> 02:26:41.640]  And this Arab Spring was really a rise of radical Islam.
[02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:46.441]  And anyone who understood it understood that this was not a democratic movement.
[02:26:46.501 --> 02:26:50.303]  And Google's on record four years ago helping coordinate it for them.
[02:26:50.663 --> 02:26:54.244]  Well, and Google, and, you know, Twitter is also another.
[02:26:55.005 --> 02:26:58.346]  All these organ... Twitter has also got Saudi Arabia investment in it.
[02:26:59.146 --> 02:27:00.527]  The, uh, the...
[02:27:01.627 --> 02:27:11.134]  The idea of the Middle East being destabilized was that the Saudis, through the jihadists, remember Wahhabism comes out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:27:11.154 --> 02:27:14.596]  It's one of the most radical forms of Islam in the Middle East.
[02:27:15.116 --> 02:27:16.237]  But it's all Sunni.
[02:27:16.918 --> 02:27:19.579]  What they want is to re-establish a caliphate.
[02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:24.063]  A caliphate would be like the Ottoman Empire re-established under Turkey.
[02:27:26.264 --> 02:27:44.687]  The way to get there, the jihadist thing, is to destabilize the Middle East with the Muslim Brotherhood, with Al-Qaeda, working in concert with terrorist acts to gain, to destabilize, create fear, gain power.
[02:27:45.588 --> 02:27:53.710]  Like in Egypt, the original attempt in Egypt with Morsi was once Morsi was elected, the Muslim Brotherhood won the parliamentary election.
[02:27:54.251 --> 02:27:56.191]  Parliamentary seats then give them power.
[02:27:56.231 --> 02:28:00.932]  The next step is to cancel the next election and declare the Muslim Brotherhood in power.
[02:28:01.753 --> 02:28:09.875]  These techniques are used, I mean, we've got to go back to the Muslim Brotherhood's roots, the Mufti in Jerusalem, the roots with Hitler.
[02:28:10.675 --> 02:28:15.156]  The whole idea of the, you know, radical control of the Middle East.
[02:28:15.176 --> 02:28:15.716]  Sure, sure.
[02:28:15.736 --> 02:28:17.917]  Well, British intelligence, how do they play in?
[02:28:17.957 --> 02:28:21.178]  Because they helped set up Saudi Arabia with Lawrence of Arabia.
[02:28:21.798 --> 02:28:29.460]  But now even England, from your sources, why did England, who's usually going for all this, why did they say let's not do it?
[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:35.301]  And even if there's another chemical attack, that was obviously saying don't stage another one, we're still not going to go in.
[02:28:35.601 --> 02:28:38.162]  What happened in England to get them to stop what they were doing?
[02:28:38.562 --> 02:28:40.864]  There was no necessity for England to be involved.
[02:28:41.464 --> 02:28:42.385]  England could sit it out.
[02:28:42.445 --> 02:28:47.809]  England's got an increasingly socialized population on the left.
[02:28:48.310 --> 02:28:52.713]  There's a large Arabic population, increasingly so, in London.
[02:28:53.394 --> 02:28:58.417]  And so there's no reason to destabilize Great Britain at this time.
[02:28:58.458 --> 02:29:02.361]  The United States handled the destabilization of the Middle East.
[02:29:03.041 --> 02:29:08.647]  And it was all moving in favor of greater control for the Sunnis.
[02:29:08.947 --> 02:29:09.287]  Sure.
[02:29:09.728 --> 02:29:13.591]  Over all these radicalized... Why do the French suddenly want to be involved?
[02:29:14.132 --> 02:29:15.914]  Well, the French have a deep interest in Mali.
[02:29:15.934 --> 02:29:19.837]  Look at how much of the French oil is again yet coming out of Africa.
[02:29:20.518 --> 02:29:25.320]  You know, again, you've got to go to the oil politics if you really want to understand the Middle East and North Africa.
[02:29:25.540 --> 02:29:25.980]  Exactly.
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:34.863]  So they're planning to invade all of Africa with their new al-Qaeda secret armies and their promised goodies and to be part of the new al-Qaeda caliphate if they play ball.
[02:29:35.443 --> 02:29:37.883]  Ultimately, Qaddafi wanted this.
[02:29:37.944 --> 02:29:42.345]  Qaddafi was moving to create mosques all through Africa.
[02:29:42.405 --> 02:29:46.626]  The move to create an African Union... Stay there.
[02:29:46.866 --> 02:29:47.206]  Stay there.
[02:29:47.246 --> 02:29:48.027]  Tell us on the other side, doctor.
[02:29:48.047 --> 02:29:48.607]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.147 --> 02:29:50.769]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.691 --> 02:29:54.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.081 --> 02:30:03.947]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[02:30:04.557 --> 02:30:07.838]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[02:30:08.378 --> 02:30:11.259]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[02:30:11.799 --> 02:30:14.619]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:21.261]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[02:30:21.861 --> 02:30:25.302]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[02:30:25.942 --> 02:30:36.652]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[02:30:37.353 --> 02:30:42.358]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.

[02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:03.870]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:04.211 --> 02:31:07.794]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:07.834 --> 02:31:10.356]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:10.376 --> 02:31:15.822]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:16.242 --> 02:31:22.488]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:22.908 --> 02:31:28.452]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:28.872 --> 02:31:32.555]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:33.055 --> 02:31:37.038]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:37.338 --> 02:31:42.862]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:43.283 --> 02:31:46.245]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:46.845 --> 02:31:48.286]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:48.826 --> 02:31:49.267]  It's here.

[02:33:02.368 --> 02:33:03.889]  We are on the march.
[02:33:04.229 --> 02:33:06.671]  The empire is on the run.
[02:33:07.391 --> 02:33:11.114]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:24.908 --> 02:33:32.655]  Folks, by the end of the broadcast today, and then we'll have it on the Nightly News tonight, we're gonna have Kit Daniels with a big write-up on the whistleblower.
[02:33:33.997 --> 02:33:37.980]  Tosh Plumlee, who was on yesterday, who's a famous whistleblower,
[02:33:38.757 --> 02:33:42.621]  Not just on Iran-Contra when he got called up, but before that from the church hearings.
[02:33:42.641 --> 02:33:45.364]  He still works as a contractor for the CIA.
[02:33:45.404 --> 02:33:50.469]  Yesterday he was in an Air Force base with a line of C-130s loading them up with weapons.
[02:33:50.850 --> 02:33:52.071]  Obviously a classified mission.
[02:33:53.052 --> 02:33:56.876]  But he's been over there and he talked to a high-level NATO official.
[02:33:58.017 --> 02:34:03.321]  Uh, and they broke down the, no indeed, the ambassador and others, exactly what I was told by people in the Pentagon.
[02:34:03.981 --> 02:34:07.283]  Colonel Schaffer concurred and said that was a lot of the info he was getting.
[02:34:07.624 --> 02:34:09.705]  That undoubtedly it was a hit of the ambassador.
[02:34:10.426 --> 02:34:12.787]  But I went forward to say no, it was a planned hit.
[02:34:13.047 --> 02:34:15.089]  We know Obama stood down for more than six hours.
[02:34:16.278 --> 02:34:20.039]  And Plumlee is a very credible source.
[02:34:20.419 --> 02:34:22.560]  Jim Mars got us in contact with him.
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:25.981]  He hasn't been heard from in over a decade politically.
[02:34:26.001 --> 02:34:31.963]  He had a gag order in 1991 when he was called to Congress about CIA operations.
[02:34:32.623 --> 02:34:39.465]  He's been advising Joint Task Force 6 at Fort Bliss, Texas down there on the whole Mexican drug war.
[02:34:40.465 --> 02:34:52.752]  And he was on admitting that basically elements of our government, the Mexican government, are the ones really running it, and there's a war with the white hats in our government, and the Mexican Navy are the good guys, which is my intel from DEA sources as well.
[02:34:53.313 --> 02:34:55.514]  So, I mean, this is just a mess, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:56.255 --> 02:35:06.841]  And he confirmed, and that video's up on InfoWars.com, but it's going to be an article that we're going to tweet out at Real Alex Jones at the end of the hour after Dr. Corsi leaves us and we take some calls.
[02:35:08.624 --> 02:35:16.970]  That he talked to a NATO official while in the Middle East, and again, there's a lot he can't say because he's on classified missions.
[02:35:16.990 --> 02:35:18.091]  He said, I'm going to get in a lot of trouble.
[02:35:18.151 --> 02:35:19.372]  He might get killed over this.
[02:35:20.193 --> 02:35:21.414]  He's had friends that have been killed.
[02:35:21.434 --> 02:35:22.935]  They've had congressional hearings about this.
[02:35:23.435 --> 02:35:24.576]  Last time stuff came out.
[02:35:24.876 --> 02:35:31.981]  But he said he's not going to sit there and watch that mother ask why her son, Mr. Smith, died.
[02:35:32.742 --> 02:35:33.342]  Well, we know.
[02:35:33.523 --> 02:35:37.766]  We know the al-Qaeda security force in Benghazi hired as the State Department security.
[02:35:39.298 --> 02:35:49.286]  The General Security came in and killed those people, and the local bases were told, stand down, and the local CIA base full of commandos did stand down.
[02:35:50.787 --> 02:35:59.975]  But he was confirming from two sources, one NATO, one military in Texas, that, well you heard it yesterday,
[02:36:01.286 --> 02:36:19.879]  That indeed it was State Department legal arms under the arms export operation, legal on paper but not really legal because it was to groups listed as terrorist, sent down there and that it was actually what he called high energy weapons, high impact weapons was the exact quote.
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:22.360]  U.S.
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:29.165]  Stinger type missiles, new generation, not just the French missiles and stuff that got taken from Gaddafi stores.
[02:36:30.302 --> 02:36:33.864]  And that the ambassador sent cables saying, I'm not going to be part of this.
[02:36:34.444 --> 02:36:35.484]  This is going to blow back.
[02:36:35.524 --> 02:36:36.445]  There was criticism.
[02:36:36.505 --> 02:36:38.106]  The military, we know, was criticizing.
[02:36:38.346 --> 02:36:40.467]  We know the Joint Chiefs have said they're against this publicly.
[02:36:41.409 --> 02:36:45.010]  And I guess to try to get everybody in line, they whacked Stevens.
[02:36:45.771 --> 02:36:51.893]  Now, Dr. Corsi, you heard what I just broke down there, and I want to then get into some other issues in the few minutes we have left with you.
[02:36:51.933 --> 02:36:57.535]  And then you're coming on, I think, next week to talk about your book that's already a bestseller on who really killed Kennedy.
[02:36:57.575 --> 02:36:58.175]  I've been reading it.
[02:36:58.215 --> 02:36:59.536]  It's intriguing info.
[02:37:01.036 --> 02:37:03.199]  Policer, you heard me just break that down.
[02:37:03.219 --> 02:37:04.581]  I know you probably haven't heard the interview yet.
[02:37:05.222 --> 02:37:06.463]  What is your intel?
[02:37:06.483 --> 02:37:08.386]  Because we said a week after it was an arms deal.
[02:37:08.606 --> 02:37:10.809]  That's now been confirmed, but they're covering up the details.
[02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:14.654]  They've changed the identities of some of the whistleblowers.
[02:37:15.355 --> 02:37:16.657]  Who knows where they really are?
[02:37:18.159 --> 02:37:23.002]  You heard what I just said from this famous CIA pilot.
[02:37:23.622 --> 02:37:24.343]  What is your take?
[02:37:24.583 --> 02:37:29.247]  Well, I mean, the Benghazi deal, I think, was entirely an arms deal.
[02:37:30.107 --> 02:37:35.551]  Stevens was meeting with one of the Turkey diplomats.
[02:37:35.611 --> 02:37:42.676]  The last dinner he had was with Turkey, one of the top Turkey officials, and they had to be discussing the shipment of arms.
[02:37:42.736 --> 02:37:43.197]  I mean, that was
[02:37:43.877 --> 02:37:52.383]  You know, one of the ships had been interdicted, yet we were still trying to get arms into Syria through Turkey.
[02:37:53.024 --> 02:37:58.008]  And we were also allowing transport for a lot of the Al-Qaeda rebels.
[02:37:58.088 --> 02:38:07.235]  I mean, it was a very complicated story because if you remember, some of the attackers that came on scene in Benghazi said Morsi sent us.
[02:38:08.390 --> 02:38:08.810]  We're
[02:38:29.953 --> 02:38:36.538]  The initial bomb in the basement of the World Trade Center that didn't succeed in bringing the towers down, but it was that plot.
[02:38:36.638 --> 02:38:48.386]  The idea was, and it suggested again, that we could have a capture, a hostage taking of our ambassador in exchange for the blind Sheikh.
[02:38:50.652 --> 02:38:52.874]  By the way, Alex, this is just coming over the news now.
[02:38:52.894 --> 02:38:56.556]  It looks like Kerry has signed the U.N.
[02:38:56.677 --> 02:39:03.802]  Arms Treaty, which is completely in violation of the Constitution because it's a treaty.
[02:39:03.822 --> 02:39:06.184]  It would have to be approved by the Senate.
[02:39:06.724 --> 02:39:07.325]  But the U.S.
[02:39:07.465 --> 02:39:11.287]  Arms Treaty is a backdoor to eliminating the Second Amendment.
[02:39:12.148 --> 02:39:12.748]  Because U.S.
[02:39:12.848 --> 02:39:13.688]  Arms Treaty, U.N.
[02:39:14.149 --> 02:39:17.709]  Arms Treaty calls for the ability of the U.N.
[02:39:17.749 --> 02:39:30.453]  to come in and shut down any private ownership of firearms that could be somehow or other tied to international transport of firearms and weapons.
[02:39:30.713 --> 02:39:34.314]  Well, that's how they're banning these 3D printer guns.
[02:39:35.354 --> 02:39:38.936]  Uh, is that they're saying it violates the international, uh, uh, arms agreement.
[02:39:38.956 --> 02:39:39.496]  And there it is.
[02:39:39.996 --> 02:39:40.977]  Kerry signs U.N.
[02:39:41.057 --> 02:39:41.637]  arms treaty.
[02:39:41.797 --> 02:39:43.258]  Senator threatens to block it.
[02:39:43.798 --> 02:39:45.539]  That just came out on Fox News.
[02:39:45.659 --> 02:39:50.041]  We're gonna po- we're gonna post it to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:39:50.521 --> 02:39:51.502]  It's huge news.
[02:39:51.562 --> 02:40:01.994]  This is a huge move to try to backdoor the end to the Second Amendment, which is one of the major objectives of the Obama administration.
[02:40:02.054 --> 02:40:09.262]  The backdooring goes right along with the ramping up of the NSA and the trying to keep the NSA under wraps.
[02:40:10.003 --> 02:40:14.726]  You know, we have a Gestapo intelligence system that Hitler would have loved to have had.
[02:40:14.786 --> 02:40:17.708]  Well, sir, let me ask you this in the five minutes we've got left, Dr. Corsi.
[02:40:17.748 --> 02:40:18.469]  Let me ask you this.
[02:40:19.109 --> 02:40:32.098]  They have public schools under Department of Education now saying if you're seen playing with a water gun or a plastic gun that shoots airsoft plastic pellets, you're kicked out of school for an entire year, nine months of school.
[02:40:32.658 --> 02:40:33.619]  This is a reign of terror.
[02:40:34.499 --> 02:40:41.081]  They are now having Obama Corps people under ACORN type groups come to your door with your social security number.
[02:40:41.121 --> 02:40:44.282]  This is a total criminal takeover.
[02:40:44.302 --> 02:40:46.262]  I cannot believe how insane it is.
[02:40:46.322 --> 02:40:47.442]  It's worse than I thought.
[02:40:47.502 --> 02:40:48.543]  It's moving quicker.
[02:40:48.963 --> 02:40:50.523]  It looks like it's now happening.
[02:40:51.443 --> 02:40:54.204]  They're bad-mouthing George Washington and the new army manuals.
[02:40:54.544 --> 02:40:56.465]  We have entered twilight zone levels.
[02:40:56.485 --> 02:40:57.125]  Let me ask you this.
[02:40:58.606 --> 02:41:02.168]  Seventeen to nineteen percent in Gallup trust the government, all-time low.
[02:41:02.208 --> 02:41:05.850]  So people are waking up, the military's waking up, the police are waking up.
[02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:17.216]  The system admits they're waking up, but it appears the socialist, cloward and piven, banker-run scum doesn't care and is going to go all the way.
[02:41:17.256 --> 02:41:18.297]  So let me ask you this.
[02:41:19.418 --> 02:41:26.342]  Obama now promised to the black caucus that he spoke to that he's quote fired up and will get the guns this year.
[02:41:27.322 --> 02:41:30.286]  How do they think they're going to get this done?
[02:41:30.686 --> 02:41:32.128]  What is their ace in the hole?
[02:41:32.208 --> 02:41:35.673]  And historically, what are we facing here?
[02:41:36.113 --> 02:41:38.917]  Because I have never been more on edge in my life.
[02:41:38.957 --> 02:41:43.543]  This is ten times, in my gut, anything I've ever felt, right now.
[02:41:44.964 --> 02:41:46.225]  I know everybody else is feeling it.
[02:41:46.285 --> 02:41:47.505]  Where are we, Dr. Corsi?
[02:41:47.745 --> 02:41:58.650]  Well, first of all, you've got, you know, there's always been a presumption that as this New World Order crowd gets close to the finish line, it'll be a naked dash to the finish line.
[02:41:58.690 --> 02:42:02.171]  But in other words, they will get rid of all the pretenses.
[02:42:02.211 --> 02:42:02.892]  They'll just come out.
[02:42:03.852 --> 02:42:05.173]  Violate the First Amendment.
[02:42:05.193 --> 02:42:07.935]  Violate the Second Amendment.
[02:42:08.055 --> 02:42:09.035]  Confiscate guns.
[02:42:09.075 --> 02:42:15.819]  Gun registration used by those who want to eliminate the Second Amendment is the first step to gun confiscation.
[02:42:16.379 --> 02:42:18.641]  Once they know where the guns are, they know where to go get them.
[02:42:19.688 --> 02:42:25.914]  And the desensitizing of kids in the schools to think that guns are evil.
[02:42:27.475 --> 02:42:41.508]  All the discussion that we've seen, even this Navy Yard shooting where the troops had been armed, you go back to the Clinton era, disarming our troops, our military on military bases, which is a disgrace.
[02:42:42.008 --> 02:42:43.029]  The troops have been armed.
[02:42:43.109 --> 02:42:45.851]  But now the school says you can't have toy guns at home.
[02:42:45.911 --> 02:42:47.052]  That's totally illegal.
[02:42:48.393 --> 02:42:52.756]  Kids in the backyard playing with guns are now being disciplined in schools.
[02:42:53.076 --> 02:42:55.658]  They're being reported by neighbors and disciplined in schools.
[02:42:56.799 --> 02:43:02.003]  The public school system is really just increasingly a social control network.
[02:43:04.447 --> 02:43:18.460]  What's going on today also with Ted Cruz, the Republican Party I think is finally, a group of the Republican Party is realizing that there's no fundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats.
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:24.366]  If you're dealing with John McCain and Lindsey Graham and the establishment Republicans,
[02:43:25.066 --> 02:43:28.728]  They are identical in their objectives to the Democrats.
[02:43:29.268 --> 02:43:32.189]  And they really don't want to defund Obamacare.
[02:43:32.629 --> 02:43:41.713]  They want the increasing government involvement, the increasing government supervision, the increasing government encroaching on the economy.
[02:43:42.393 --> 02:43:48.356]  Now what happens usually, and I think we already had the first false flag attempted, that was Syria.
[02:43:49.196 --> 02:44:00.223]  If Obama could have sold that Assad was responsible for the chemical attacks and anybody in the United States had cared, that would have been an impetus to go to war.
[02:44:00.243 --> 02:44:03.805]  I think they're looking for another impetus to go to war.
[02:44:03.825 --> 02:44:09.909]  Unfortunately, the American people, I think, are waking up too, Alex, and are saying, enough.
[02:44:10.765 --> 02:44:21.673]  But the biggest fear, the biggest threat is a collapse of the economy, is a fundamental breakdown of the fiat money system.
[02:44:22.633 --> 02:44:26.276]  By the way, for folks that don't know, that's really your forte from Harvard.
[02:44:26.296 --> 02:44:28.477]  You advise the biggest banks in the world.
[02:44:28.497 --> 02:44:29.458]  You don't toot your horn.
[02:44:29.738 --> 02:44:32.280]  You are an expert on international banking.
[02:44:33.141 --> 02:44:34.682]  At what point are we right now?
[02:44:35.740 --> 02:44:55.632]  They could close down the international banking system, create a crisis any day with just a series of, a triggered series of bailouts that were not provided that began implosion in the EU which could carry over to the United States, an implosion in the derivatives market
[02:44:56.232 --> 02:45:02.095]  Which is, you know, something like now a $700 trillion market that no one truly understands.
[02:45:02.115 --> 02:45:07.098]  There's any number of ways to implode the system with this much debt.
[02:45:07.938 --> 02:45:20.905]  And the goal would be to collapse all the fiat currencies into one fiat currency, probably issued by the International Monetary Fund, or to propose an alternative to the dollar.
[02:45:21.605 --> 02:45:22.385]  For international trade.
[02:45:22.445 --> 02:45:29.127]  The new global SDR with a hundred trillion over a decade credit to back to bankers, what they called for two years ago at Davos.
[02:45:29.407 --> 02:45:31.508]  And as usual, doctor, you have hit it right on the head.
[02:45:31.928 --> 02:45:33.369]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[02:45:33.709 --> 02:45:50.014]  They know something so horrible is coming, total economic collapse, that they're going to pose as saviors and we're going to do anything, including registering and then turning in our guns and accepting brigade homeland and welcoming the army in because things are so bad.
[02:45:50.914 --> 02:45:51.875]  We will be welcoming them.
[02:45:51.995 --> 02:45:54.556]  I will welcome them in if people are rioting for two weeks straight.
[02:45:55.517 --> 02:45:58.719]  And then it's all acclimated and then Obama gets to be the savior.
[02:45:59.219 --> 02:46:06.104]  In Kenya, likely today, you know, the first impulse is going to be to increase security.
[02:46:06.584 --> 02:46:09.666]  Give more power to the Kenyan government in order to go after the bad guys.
[02:46:09.686 --> 02:46:12.408]  They're now calling for checkpoints here and mall security because of it.
[02:46:12.748 --> 02:46:17.331]  Forgetting that the Kenyan government was the one who invited the bad guys into the first place.
[02:46:18.820 --> 02:46:33.586]  You know, the government gets more power to police the terrorist problem the government invited into the country, and authorize through the Constitution, this new Constitution, to be able to have Sharia law rights in the country.
[02:46:33.606 --> 02:46:40.809]  I mean, you basically, by empowering the government, are empowering the criminals that caused the problem.
[02:46:40.829 --> 02:46:42.710]  By the way, this was also racial, as you know.
[02:46:42.750 --> 02:46:48.232]  They not only asked him who was Muhammad's mother, if you were white, they shot you out of hand thinking you wouldn't be a Muslim.
[02:46:48.892 --> 02:47:00.455]  Well, again, the whole Luo-Kikuyu overlay of tribal violence in Kenya could break out again at any moment.
[02:47:01.016 --> 02:47:04.977]  That's another tinderbox that's ready to explode at any instant.
[02:47:05.497 --> 02:47:08.118]  But Kenya's also on the edge financially.
[02:47:08.918 --> 02:47:15.620]  If Kenya collapses, or if the international economy is to collapse further in Africa,
[02:47:16.300 --> 02:47:20.443]  You're going to have massive social unrest throughout Africa.
[02:47:21.004 --> 02:47:26.608]  Right now, throughout Northern Africa, the economic activity has about gone to zero.
[02:47:26.688 --> 02:47:36.696]  I mean, you're struggling in Libya to revitalize the oil industry, when the country is still basically in the hands of terrorists who control the government.
[02:47:36.776 --> 02:47:37.337]  Incredible.
[02:47:37.597 --> 02:47:39.438]  Bottom line, sir, we'll let you go in 60 seconds.
[02:47:39.979 --> 02:47:42.561]  Bottom line, how are things going for the New World Order, though?
[02:47:42.941 --> 02:47:53.924]  I mean, I know they always use crises to get more power, but if they get blamed for the crisis that they've helped execute, could we see a fall of the New World Order, or at least damage?
[02:47:53.964 --> 02:47:56.665]  Because everything they're touching turns to you-know-what.
[02:47:56.685 --> 02:48:01.406]  Well, and again, this is why I'm working so hard, and you are too, Alex, to expose this agenda.
[02:48:01.986 --> 02:48:06.150]  To make people aware that, you know, that's why I wrote the book on Kennedy.
[02:48:06.170 --> 02:48:20.384]  We'll cover that later, but it's again the whole exposure of this New World Order agenda, which is intent on using intelligence agencies to lie, intelligence agencies to control the population.
[02:48:20.925 --> 02:48:23.928]  It's predicated on confiscating guns.
[02:48:24.568 --> 02:48:34.337]  It intends to have a educational system in which children are indoctrinated and to have a police state in which the citizenry is disarmed.
[02:48:34.917 --> 02:48:39.922]  Those are the primary... Yeah, bottom line, the New World Order is not a good deal for anybody, but maybe one...
[02:48:41.343 --> 02:48:43.886]  If you do live in it, you live in it as a slave.
[02:48:44.547 --> 02:48:48.873]  You live in it provided you don't disagree and don't demand too much.
[02:48:49.574 --> 02:48:57.283]  It's only going to be beneficial for a very small group at the top, as any of these, you know, dictatorships or structures are.
[02:48:58.004 --> 02:49:03.827]  Benefiting the international businesses, multinational corporations that want the cheapest labor possible.
[02:49:04.467 --> 02:49:09.690]  It's a destructive system that will not advance human beings.
[02:49:09.770 --> 02:49:11.491]  It won't have respect for human rights.
[02:49:11.511 --> 02:49:12.572]  It's a race to the bottom.
[02:49:12.792 --> 02:49:15.413]  Powerfully said, WND.com.
[02:49:15.773 --> 02:49:20.976]  Doc, we got you on next week, I believe, for a full hour to break down your new amazing book that's already on pre-sale.
[02:49:21.296 --> 02:49:21.796]  Thank you.
[02:49:21.876 --> 02:49:23.157]  And by the way, I've read most of the book now.
[02:49:23.257 --> 02:49:24.057]  Very powerful.
[02:49:24.278 --> 02:49:25.218]  We'll talk to you soon, sir.
[02:49:25.598 --> 02:49:26.299]  I look forward to it.
[02:49:26.319 --> 02:49:27.039]  Thank you very much.
[02:49:27.159 --> 02:49:27.980]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:30.262]  Yeah, they don't like what he's saying, folks.
[02:49:30.282 --> 02:49:31.303]  They're censoring this.
[02:49:31.443 --> 02:49:32.443]  They're mad about this.
[02:49:32.884 --> 02:49:40.891]  That last interview where we showed all the documents on air about Obama funding the terrorists, directly that are involved in the Nairobi shooting, this is dangerous stuff.
[02:49:40.931 --> 02:49:42.952]  And I'm not up here just saying that every five minutes now.
[02:49:43.393 --> 02:49:44.193]  I didn't used to say that.
[02:49:44.234 --> 02:49:45.895]  I mean, we're under threat, okay?
[02:49:45.915 --> 02:49:46.636]  We need your prayers.
[02:49:47.376 --> 02:49:48.277]  Dr. Corsi needs them.
[02:49:48.317 --> 02:49:48.938]  We all need them.
[02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:50.300]  And we're all in this together.
[02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:51.221]  Ted Cruz needs it.
[02:49:51.822 --> 02:49:52.743]  Matt Drudge needs it.
[02:49:52.783 --> 02:49:53.684]  Ron Paul needs it.
[02:49:54.305 --> 02:49:58.511]  Anybody that starts telling the truth or is on the front lines of liberty is under attack.
[02:49:58.771 --> 02:50:00.794]  But hey, we're in motion ourselves.
[02:50:01.074 --> 02:50:02.035]  We're on the offense.
[02:50:02.135 --> 02:50:02.496]  Fine.
[02:50:02.856 --> 02:50:03.838]  We know it's a fight.
[02:50:04.639 --> 02:50:05.400]  We asked for it.
[02:50:07.247 --> 02:50:11.250]  I want to tell you about MrMiniBox.com before we come back and go to your calls.
[02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:13.992]  People of all walks of life are preparing for economic collapse.
[02:50:14.012 --> 02:50:20.257]  MrMiniBox.com provides storage solutions that are mold, mildew and water resistant.
[02:50:20.777 --> 02:50:28.323]  Ladies and gentlemen, these boxes are a perfect solution for protecting your survival equipment or storable food for when you need it most.
[02:50:28.743 --> 02:50:31.184]  They're perfect for storing in the basement or even underground.
[02:50:31.264 --> 02:50:36.447]  MrMinibox.com is your patriotic destination for lightweight stackable storage bins.
[02:50:36.847 --> 02:50:41.750]  Go to MrMinibox.com forward slash Alex to get prepared today and find some of their specials.
[02:50:41.790 --> 02:50:44.292]  That's MrMinibox.com forward slash Alex.
[02:50:44.332 --> 02:50:45.852]  Great way to hide your guns as well.
[02:50:47.013 --> 02:50:50.055]  And that's the one thing holding the scum back, folks, that we've got guns.
[02:50:50.075 --> 02:50:51.235]  We're willing to defend ourselves.
[02:50:51.616 --> 02:50:54.197]  They would love to have their way with us like the Red Terror.
[02:50:54.577 --> 02:50:55.258]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:55.278 --> 02:50:55.678]  Stay with us.
[02:50:58.522 --> 02:51:03.143]  Every time you eat a cooked food, your body responds by producing an increase in circulating white blood cells.
[02:51:03.483 --> 02:51:08.344]  This happens because nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level.
[02:51:08.804 --> 02:51:14.485]  When we heat food to normal cooking temperatures, we change the shape of the molecules into shapes the body cannot use.
[02:51:14.905 --> 02:51:17.665]  The body now looks at them as toxins and allergens.
[02:51:18.106 --> 02:51:25.667]  In an effort to protect itself from this irritant, the body intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as garbage collectors.
[02:51:26.107 --> 02:51:31.189]  White blood cells gobble up all the unusable damaged food particles to neutralize their cell damaging properties.
[02:51:31.530 --> 02:51:36.412]  This puts stress on your organs of elimination and your body is subject to cell damage and inflammation.
[02:51:36.892 --> 02:51:42.975]  If you'd like to start experiencing the benefits of undamaged protein in your diet, give One World Way a try.
[02:51:43.335 --> 02:51:48.357]  It is a truly undamaged protein powder that will thrill your tastes and every cell of your body.

[02:52:29.491 --> 02:52:32.353]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[02:52:32.633 --> 02:52:33.794]  But what about the seventh?
[02:52:34.014 --> 02:52:38.057]  Unlike ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[02:52:38.277 --> 02:52:39.598]  And it just won't quit.
[02:52:39.818 --> 02:52:46.323]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prepper, Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[02:52:46.523 --> 02:52:48.505]  That means safety and peace of mind.
[02:52:48.685 --> 02:52:51.026]  Buy yours at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:52:51.106 --> 02:52:54.989]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:52:55.129 --> 02:52:56.450]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:52:56.590 --> 02:52:57.411]  Just won't quit.
[02:52:57.851 --> 02:52:59.472]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:52:59.752 --> 02:53:03.235]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:53:03.375 --> 02:53:07.798]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:53:07.918 --> 02:53:13.922]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:53:14.022 --> 02:53:24.829]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:53:25.009 --> 02:53:31.310]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:53:31.511 --> 02:53:46.234]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:53:46.514 --> 02:53:48.175]  Day after day, alone on a hill
[02:54:09.262 --> 02:54:20.785]  You know, there's an article up on Infowars.com that says Bloomberg poll nearly half the nation views Obama unfavorably.
[02:54:21.665 --> 02:54:25.046]  Folks, that's a Bloomberg baloney poll.
[02:54:25.966 --> 02:54:32.328]  If you really look at all the polls, Obama's got about 30% support by idiots that are on welfare and that think he's their daddy.
[02:54:34.747 --> 02:54:41.314]  I mean, there's a Gallup poll out showing 17%, if you look at conservatives, it's 19% if you just do the whole country.
[02:54:42.776 --> 02:54:44.698]  19% support of government period.
[02:54:45.038 --> 02:54:46.840]  Congress has a 10% approval rating.
[02:54:47.601 --> 02:54:50.044]  So just remember that when you see all these polls.
[02:54:50.084 --> 02:54:52.747]  They are a load of bull.
[02:54:55.876 --> 02:54:57.297]  I'm out there talking to the public.
[02:54:57.357 --> 02:54:58.118]  You see the numbers.
[02:54:58.158 --> 02:54:59.059]  You see the military.
[02:54:59.079 --> 02:55:02.962]  The military came out a few months ago and said nobody believes our PSYOPs anymore.
[02:55:02.982 --> 02:55:05.403]  So we're going to promise to tell the truth now.
[02:55:05.443 --> 02:55:06.704]  That itself another PSYOP.
[02:55:07.365 --> 02:55:09.126]  But the military people know what's going on.
[02:55:09.186 --> 02:55:13.129]  William in Tennessee listening on 1470 AM WBCR.
[02:55:13.209 --> 02:55:17.573]  And we'll go to Will in Oklahoma listening on XM244.
[02:55:17.593 --> 02:55:19.834]  You're on the air, William.
[02:55:19.854 --> 02:55:20.175]  Go ahead.
[02:55:21.149 --> 02:55:24.591]  A couple of things on Mr. Cruz that he's actually incorrect about.
[02:55:25.331 --> 02:55:27.573]  Congress is not exempt from the health care bill.
[02:55:27.973 --> 02:55:28.954]  They're not exempt from it.
[02:55:29.154 --> 02:55:34.277]  They have to go to the exchanges like anybody else does on the exchanges to get their health care benefits if they want to.
[02:55:35.317 --> 02:55:38.619]  No, no, that's not... Is he a Democratic seminar caller?
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:41.521]  Okay, second of all... No, put him on hold.
[02:55:41.721 --> 02:55:42.181]  Put him on hold.
[02:55:42.221 --> 02:55:45.023]  This is a Democratic... I'll give you time in a minute, but I actually...
[02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:47.790]  Know what you're going to say next.
[02:55:48.070 --> 02:55:49.251]  I've heard the seminar calls.
[02:55:49.331 --> 02:55:50.011]  I know what they are.
[02:55:50.851 --> 02:55:51.731]  And I don't mind.
[02:55:51.771 --> 02:55:52.992]  We don't screen your calls, sir.
[02:55:53.492 --> 02:55:56.773]  We're a different type of radio show, but I will tell people when it's a seminar call.
[02:55:57.033 --> 02:55:57.793]  That's not true.
[02:55:58.333 --> 02:55:59.813]  That's a Harry Reid talking point.
[02:56:01.454 --> 02:56:03.094]  This is designed to bankrupt the country.
[02:56:03.134 --> 02:56:05.615]  It was written by the insurance companies.
[02:56:05.835 --> 02:56:06.935]  Mitt Romney was behind it.
[02:56:06.995 --> 02:56:09.496]  You Democrats only care about the Democratic Party.
[02:56:10.596 --> 02:56:12.057]  And you feel like you're on a winning team.
[02:56:14.418 --> 02:56:18.239]  If I really wanted to hurt you guys, I would not try to stop this going through.
[02:56:19.039 --> 02:56:20.739]  Listen, my dad's in healthcare management.
[02:56:20.799 --> 02:56:22.839]  He's going to basically retire over this.
[02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:25.160]  Because he knows what it is, okay?
[02:56:26.420 --> 02:56:28.000]  And you don't know what you're talking about.
[02:56:28.821 --> 02:56:30.861]  Now, you think you're going to get some free deal.
[02:56:31.741 --> 02:56:35.122]  Did Obama raise taxes on people making less than $200,000 a year?
[02:56:35.182 --> 02:56:35.642]  Yes, he did.
[02:56:36.462 --> 02:56:38.802]  Did Obama sign the NDAA when he said he wouldn't?
[02:56:38.862 --> 02:56:40.643]  Did Obama hire more lobbies than anybody else?
[02:56:41.023 --> 02:56:42.743]  Did Obama say that raising the debt limit
[02:56:43.723 --> 02:56:44.824]  Did not raise the debt limit.
[02:56:45.965 --> 02:56:56.992]  I don't mind having people that disagree, but when they're spewing Harry Reid vomit, like Harry Reid vomited it on William, and then he vomited it on me.
[02:56:57.572 --> 02:57:00.114]  Now, tell me who's talking points you're reading.
[02:57:00.154 --> 02:57:01.675]  What site is it from?
[02:57:01.715 --> 02:57:03.276]  Harry Reid's site or WhiteHouse.gov?
[02:57:03.536 --> 02:57:05.898]  And then if you're honest about it, I'll let you read the points on air.
[02:57:05.918 --> 02:57:06.238]  Go ahead.
[02:57:06.498 --> 02:57:07.339]  Whose points are you reading?
[02:57:08.622 --> 02:57:09.903]  This is from the bill.
[02:57:10.543 --> 02:57:11.844]  It's from the federal government.
[02:57:12.264 --> 02:57:13.945]  It's from the healthcare.gov site.
[02:57:14.005 --> 02:57:16.607]  It's the federal government saying that Congress is not exempt.
[02:57:17.067 --> 02:57:18.388]  They can go through changes they want to.
[02:57:18.408 --> 02:57:18.888]  There you go.
[02:57:18.968 --> 02:57:20.749]  It's a White House baloney.
[02:57:21.790 --> 02:57:26.793]  Just like they have fact sheets at Walgreens saying there are no side effects from the flu shot?
[02:57:26.813 --> 02:57:34.918]  I mean, they'll hand you a sheet saying there's no side effects, but you're not reading from the actual bill.
[02:57:36.448 --> 02:57:42.635]  You're reading from a Democratic Party captured and run federal website lying to you.
[02:57:42.956 --> 02:57:44.217]  Go ahead and read the next line.
[02:57:44.237 --> 02:57:44.818]  I knew you were reading.
[02:57:44.838 --> 02:57:45.158]  Go ahead.
[02:57:45.859 --> 02:57:46.580]  I'm not reading anything.
[02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:47.781]  I'm sitting in my car in a parking lot.
[02:57:47.801 --> 02:57:53.087]  Second of all, according to Premium Advisory, on the average going down now, they will get premiums on some people.
[02:57:53.127 --> 02:57:53.848]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:57:53.928 --> 02:57:57.112]  But on average they're going back down 16% according to Health and Human Services.
[02:58:00.034 --> 02:58:03.496]  That's true.
[02:58:03.516 --> 02:58:06.318]  You better hope this thing gets repealed, dummy.
[02:58:07.039 --> 02:58:08.660]  But you know, I know how it is.
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:09.941]  I'm going to hold you up.
[02:58:09.961 --> 02:58:10.741]  We're going into overdrive.
[02:58:11.282 --> 02:58:12.283]  I know how this works.
[02:58:14.144 --> 02:58:17.126]  You know, I should actually open my phones up for supporters of this.
[02:58:18.527 --> 02:58:22.310]  I want you to know, my dad is a healthcare manager.
[02:58:23.377 --> 02:58:26.399]  And he, you know, has been and testified for the legislature, you name it.
[02:58:26.479 --> 02:58:31.283]  He actually, he's actually read most of the 10,000 pages scanned over it.
[02:58:33.244 --> 02:58:36.146]  And he... I'll come back to you in a minute.

[02:59:36.966 --> 02:59:38.987]  ...and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:59:50.816 --> 02:59:52.217]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:52.877 --> 02:59:56.079]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:03.188 --> 03:00:07.353]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:08.013 --> 03:00:08.834]  You want answers?
[03:00:09.615 --> 03:00:10.516]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:11.157 --> 03:00:14.801]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:15.341 --> 03:00:19.446]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.967 --> 03:00:21.949]  Alright, I'm gonna try to not be mean to this guy.
[03:00:22.169 --> 03:00:24.411]  Look, you can read the way the bill's written.
[03:00:25.751 --> 03:00:27.832]  The original bill, 3,000 pages.
[03:00:28.453 --> 03:00:31.875]  The amendments are 10,600 and something pages.
[03:00:32.375 --> 03:00:33.456]  And there's more amendments.
[03:00:33.536 --> 03:00:40.000]  I mean, next you're going to tell me there aren't exemptions for big corporations.
[03:00:40.740 --> 03:00:48.765]  Or next you're going to tell me, this is what Harry Reid does, and I know it's not true because I've actually looked at the bill, that it wouldn't make people lay folks off.
[03:00:50.506 --> 03:00:52.627]  Or cut them back from full-time to part-time.
[03:00:52.647 --> 03:00:53.628]  That's what's happening.
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:58.743]  And I've talked to the health care experts, the lawyers, I've looked at it all.
[03:00:59.804 --> 03:01:00.224]  Okay?
[03:01:00.725 --> 03:01:02.466]  For what it means to my operation.
[03:01:03.367 --> 03:01:09.051]  And let me ask you this question, William, and then I'll let you talk a couple minutes, because I don't want to just sit here and laugh at you.
[03:01:09.071 --> 03:01:09.672]  I apologize.
[03:01:10.072 --> 03:01:11.393]  You sound like a nice guy, actually.
[03:01:11.813 --> 03:01:13.074]  You just believe in these people.
[03:01:14.095 --> 03:01:15.776]  What do you think of Obama overall?
[03:01:15.836 --> 03:01:23.883]  I mean, so I guess you think he's a good guy, or tell me, and you really think he, and the insurance companies that wrote this,
[03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:26.921]  They're doing this because they love us and care about us?
[03:01:26.961 --> 03:01:27.582]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:01:27.602 --> 03:01:33.205]  The health care bill is designed to allow people to have access to global health insurance through the exchanges on the open market.
[03:01:33.225 --> 03:01:33.726]  That's what it is.
[03:01:33.746 --> 03:01:35.267]  It's not government-run.
[03:01:45.944 --> 03:01:48.365]  If you have insurance through your company, you can keep that.
[03:01:48.405 --> 03:01:48.986]  That's fine.
[03:01:49.286 --> 03:01:52.929]  But if you want insurance through the exchanges, you can sign up for that and use the exchanges.
[03:01:53.469 --> 03:01:58.112]  Now, as far as premiums go... You know what, sir, sir, sir, you know, they said there weren't death panels in it.
[03:01:58.653 --> 03:02:09.840]  When it does have these federal mandates and these panels, and I know healthcare, I have a bunch of family in healthcare, they have bioethics boards turning people off that are alive and talking all over the country.
[03:02:10.121 --> 03:02:11.602]  They have the case for killing Granny.
[03:02:12.502 --> 03:02:13.163]  I know.
[03:02:13.383 --> 03:02:16.006]  Your whole life is feeling like the government's your friend.
[03:02:16.346 --> 03:02:19.429]  Do you feel like your sports team won because Obama got re-elected?
[03:02:19.449 --> 03:02:21.531]  That's a silly question, Alex.
[03:02:21.571 --> 03:02:22.532]  You're messing up the topic.
[03:02:23.133 --> 03:02:26.857]  As far as the premiums go... Let me ask you this.
[03:02:26.897 --> 03:02:27.998]  Are you a government worker?
[03:02:28.018 --> 03:02:30.480]  That's none of your business, Alex.
[03:02:30.581 --> 03:02:31.642]  As far as premiums go...
[03:02:32.384 --> 03:02:32.744]  All right, man.
[03:02:32.764 --> 03:02:36.347]  Well, listen, you're insulated at your IRS job or your Parks and Wildlife job or whatever it is.
[03:02:36.387 --> 03:02:38.428]  I mean, I could just... Come on, just say I'm wrong.
[03:02:38.448 --> 03:02:40.089]  You get a state-funded payment, don't you?
[03:02:55.925 --> 03:02:57.286]  It doesn't matter what I do for a living, Alex.
[03:02:57.306 --> 03:02:59.848]  What I'm telling you is that on average... You know why I know this?
[03:02:59.868 --> 03:03:01.008]  Because I can hear you.
[03:03:01.489 --> 03:03:02.629]  Hey, you're a winner, man.
[03:03:02.669 --> 03:03:03.510]  You're the winning team.
[03:03:03.750 --> 03:03:04.271]  Hey, great.
[03:03:04.371 --> 03:03:05.892]  It's gonna... You heard it, folks.
[03:03:05.952 --> 03:03:07.132]  It's a great deal for everybody.
[03:03:07.433 --> 03:03:09.394]  This guy's already got government healthcare.
[03:03:09.734 --> 03:03:10.995]  He's already got it all set up.
[03:03:11.035 --> 03:03:12.356]  He's believing the talking point.
[03:03:12.796 --> 03:03:14.137]  You bean counters are in there.
[03:03:14.177 --> 03:03:15.778]  You really believe you're helping the country.
[03:03:16.258 --> 03:03:18.860]  You know, $20 billion to ship General Motors to China.
[03:03:19.020 --> 03:03:19.380]  All of it.
[03:03:19.420 --> 03:03:19.661]  Great.
[03:03:20.001 --> 03:03:20.941]  Obama loves us.
[03:03:21.242 --> 03:03:22.783]  Hey, should he get another Peace Prize?
[03:03:22.983 --> 03:03:23.943]  How about five more?
[03:03:23.983 --> 03:03:24.544]  How's that sound?
[03:03:27.625 --> 03:03:30.727]  This is a seminar caller.
[03:03:30.787 --> 03:03:32.769]  This guy is a seminar caller.
[03:03:34.270 --> 03:03:34.830]  Hold on a minute.
[03:03:34.930 --> 03:03:36.171]  It is very pertinent.
[03:03:36.471 --> 03:03:38.232]  Well, you listen to NPR all day, I'm sure.
[03:03:39.353 --> 03:03:40.414]  This is on topic.
[03:03:41.134 --> 03:03:43.636]  Because it's pertinent that he's lied to us on everything else.
[03:03:43.656 --> 03:03:47.118]  Like he said, don't worry, I won't sign NDAA so there wouldn't be opposition.
[03:03:47.339 --> 03:03:50.501]  Turned out his lawyers demanded it and wrote it and then he signed it.
[03:03:51.581 --> 03:03:55.044]  Did Obama raise payroll taxes on the average people and lie about that?
[03:03:56.181 --> 03:03:57.441]  No, you're going off topic.
[03:03:57.461 --> 03:04:00.262]  Back to healthcare.
[03:04:00.322 --> 03:04:01.903]  You're going off topic, Alex.
[03:04:01.923 --> 03:04:02.703]  You're trying to get me off topic.
[03:04:02.723 --> 03:04:03.983]  No, I'm not off topic!
[03:04:04.203 --> 03:04:05.564]  They've lied about everything!
[03:04:05.864 --> 03:04:09.605]  They've lied about everything, and you're calling and you're... Okay, back on healthcare again.
[03:04:11.105 --> 03:04:14.046]  As I was saying before, if you have insurance for your company, you can keep it.
[03:04:14.086 --> 03:04:14.586]  That's fine.
[03:04:14.906 --> 03:04:17.667]  The exchange is set up to have insurance on the open market, correct?
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:24.662]  No, not correct, because it's rigged to force everyone to buy it, so that will drive up the price like any other commodity you're made to buy.
[03:04:24.682 --> 03:04:26.922]  How is it rigged to make sure if you have a choice to buy it or not?
[03:04:27.242 --> 03:04:28.463]  If you don't buy it, there's a penalty.
[03:04:28.483 --> 03:04:29.663]  You don't supply interest if you don't want to.
[03:04:29.683 --> 03:04:30.543]  There's a penalty for that.
[03:04:30.923 --> 03:04:33.124]  Now, the exchanges are set up in most states.
[03:04:33.144 --> 03:04:34.184]  Some states don't do that.
[03:04:34.264 --> 03:04:35.365]  Hey, listen, bro.
[03:04:36.045 --> 03:04:36.385]  Listen.
[03:04:36.525 --> 03:04:37.505]  Hey, you're a winner.
[03:04:37.585 --> 03:04:38.586]  You work for the government.
[03:04:38.646 --> 03:04:39.546]  It's your time now.
[03:04:40.006 --> 03:04:41.046]  Just like under Stalin.
[03:04:41.066 --> 03:04:42.006]  Just like under Hitler.
[03:04:42.026 --> 03:04:42.827]  Just like under Mao.
[03:04:43.227 --> 03:04:43.907]  It's your time.
[03:04:44.647 --> 03:04:47.148]  I just want you to remember, down the road,
[03:04:49.548 --> 03:04:50.610]  You know what, I gotta come back to you.
[03:04:50.650 --> 03:04:52.372]  I bet you believe vaccines are good too.
[03:04:52.853 --> 03:04:54.415]  Hold on, I gotta talk to this guy more.
[03:04:54.475 --> 03:04:55.296]  This guy's a treasure.
[03:04:58.706 --> 03:05:00.347]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:05:00.587 --> 03:05:04.090]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[03:05:04.250 --> 03:05:08.633]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:05:08.773 --> 03:05:14.777]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:05:14.897 --> 03:05:25.665]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[03:05:25.885 --> 03:05:32.171]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[03:05:32.371 --> 03:05:47.104]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[03:05:52.327 --> 03:06:03.553]  Did you ever look at the stains in your coffee cup and then realize that's exactly what happens to your teeth?
[03:06:03.753 --> 03:06:08.356]  PowerSwabs is the 5-minute solution to get your teeth white without visiting the dentist.
[03:06:08.556 --> 03:06:10.857]  This is John Greenhut, the CEO of PowerSwabs.
[03:06:11.017 --> 03:06:16.120]  And if your teeth are stained from coffee, tea, or smoking, all it takes is 5 minutes with PowerSwabs.
[03:06:16.300 --> 03:06:20.602]  In five minutes, you'll see an average of two shades wider teeth, and in seven days, six shades.
[03:06:20.782 --> 03:06:24.705]  It's clinically proven to whiten natural teeth, as well as caps and veneers.
[03:06:24.905 --> 03:06:30.127]  The secret is a tooth detergent that was developed by Dr. Martin Ginegar that lifts stains off of your teeth.

[03:06:58.005 --> 03:06:59.366]  Do you live with stress?
[03:06:59.706 --> 03:07:03.629]  If you have nervousness or common everyday anxiety, we're looking for you.

[03:08:07.133 --> 03:08:12.698]  It's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[03:08:13.299 --> 03:08:18.464]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[03:08:19.084 --> 03:08:22.107]  It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[03:08:22.427 --> 03:08:25.811]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[03:08:32.432 --> 03:08:39.358]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:39.818 --> 03:08:43.141]  Folks, the country has 17 trillion dollars of debt.
[03:08:43.201 --> 03:08:46.664]  Communist China is the biggest owner of it, after the private federal reserve.
[03:08:47.404 --> 03:08:51.387]  They are teaching the military that the founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military.
[03:08:52.488 --> 03:08:55.170]  Public schools are designed to completely take over the family.
[03:08:56.354 --> 03:09:02.536]  Obamacare was written by the insurance companies and big banks to gang-rape the American people.
[03:09:02.556 --> 03:09:15.439]  I mean, if I got into what the federal government's doing to healthcare right now, and how it's designed to only let big HMOs and hospitals operate, and how they're shutting down small clinics all over the country right now,
[03:09:16.868 --> 03:09:18.169]  I don't think so.
[03:09:38.237 --> 03:09:45.179]  And I remember reading the Wall Street Journal, the head of the big insurance consortiums laughing at the profits and how their stock shot up.
[03:09:45.479 --> 03:09:47.500]  It's like owning stock in prisons or something.
[03:09:47.540 --> 03:09:48.580]  I mean, it's so immoral.
[03:09:49.780 --> 03:09:52.141]  And I know all the inside baseball of it.
[03:09:54.102 --> 03:10:06.005]  And this guy is calling in, and in his voice you hear the confidence, the arrogance, the enjoyment of Obama.
[03:10:07.202 --> 03:10:21.640]  And everything that's going on, and it just shows you, no matter how bad it gets, it's like people that get the Nigerian email, that, oh, send me $5,000, I'm Prince Abubi, literally, you'll get $10 million next week.
[03:10:22.515 --> 03:10:26.038]  I mean, for 15 years, I tell people I know, I say, listen, that's not real.
[03:10:26.058 --> 03:10:27.680]  You're just mad you didn't get the prince.
[03:10:28.521 --> 03:10:31.143]  I'm going to be able to meet him after I helped him give him this money.
[03:10:31.203 --> 03:10:34.867]  And then they give him the money, and then, well, you know, he's still really a prince.
[03:10:35.547 --> 03:10:40.492]  And now in Austin, they actually have people that go around and say they're the prince from Nigeria, and everybody bows down and stuff.
[03:10:40.852 --> 03:10:41.733]  That's like the Queen of England.
[03:10:41.753 --> 03:10:45.016]  She's just a big war criminal globalist, wears a crown, everybody bows down.
[03:10:45.877 --> 03:10:47.319]  And with this whole Obama thing,
[03:10:48.888 --> 03:10:51.429]  I mean, they are screwing the American people to the wall.
[03:10:51.489 --> 03:10:56.052]  They are arresting members of the press, whistleblowers that expose corruption.
[03:10:56.912 --> 03:10:58.393]  They are the NDAA.
[03:10:58.613 --> 03:11:00.234]  And this guy just says you're changing the subject.
[03:11:00.294 --> 03:11:14.162]  I mean, they're hammering us on every front, and I almost want Obamacare to go in, except I know they plan on wrecking everything, and then totally socializing it to get government control of the healthcare to carry out eugenics, which is the stated plan.
[03:11:15.291 --> 03:11:19.095]  And then I said that, you know, the listener, we're going back to him, William, and then others that are holding.
[03:11:20.256 --> 03:11:21.017]  I said to him, hey,
[03:11:24.312 --> 03:11:26.373]  You know, this is all part of the death panels and stuff.
[03:11:26.394 --> 03:11:27.574]  He's like, oh, that isn't real.
[03:11:27.654 --> 03:11:30.216]  I got Bill Gates saying it's in there and it's good.
[03:11:30.777 --> 03:11:39.103]  I mean, I've got Daschle, who helped write the bill years before with the Republicans, saying we need death panels.
[03:11:39.383 --> 03:11:41.344]  I mean, I'm informed.
[03:11:41.484 --> 03:11:42.505]  I know they said this.
[03:11:42.585 --> 03:11:47.469]  I've got the book over there that the White House science czar wrote about putting fluoride in the water to sterilize us.
[03:11:48.569 --> 03:11:50.291]  I know about the government putting
[03:11:52.395 --> 03:11:54.276]  Syphilis in vaccines and stuff.
[03:11:54.356 --> 03:11:55.697]  I know about the U.N.
[03:11:55.717 --> 03:11:57.238]  putting sterilants in the vaccines.
[03:11:57.799 --> 03:11:59.060]  I know about the facts.
[03:11:59.100 --> 03:12:02.942]  And then this person just laughs and says, what does that have to do with it?
[03:12:02.982 --> 03:12:04.003]  That's changing the subject.
[03:12:04.063 --> 03:12:08.827]  It's like saying Hitler said he wouldn't invade any more countries after he went into Danzig.
[03:12:09.627 --> 03:12:11.949]  And then he went into, and then, well, he lied.
[03:12:11.989 --> 03:12:12.649]  Why does it matter?
[03:12:12.689 --> 03:12:14.491]  Hitler now says he's going to do this for me.
[03:12:15.171 --> 03:12:18.754]  And again, getting past Obama, he's just a puppet in the final equation.
[03:12:19.773 --> 03:12:20.854]  It is so sick.
[03:12:21.675 --> 03:12:23.978]  Sir, listening to you is just amazing.
[03:12:24.458 --> 03:12:27.302]  You know they're probably not going to be able to repeal it.
[03:12:28.454 --> 03:12:30.515]  And, because the big banks want this.
[03:12:31.255 --> 03:12:31.976]  Let me ask you this.
[03:12:32.076 --> 03:12:40.400]  Obama's biggest contributors were Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and then the defense industry, weapons makers after that.
[03:12:40.940 --> 03:12:43.981]  I mean, so you just say, oh, nobody's perfect.
[03:12:44.061 --> 03:12:45.142]  Obama's not perfect.
[03:12:45.162 --> 03:12:47.783]  I know there's a lot of astroturf, a lot of paid people, too, out there.
[03:12:48.643 --> 03:12:53.786]  It's hard for me to believe, because you don't sound stupid, that you're actually calling into this show
[03:12:54.997 --> 03:12:55.858]  Let me ask you this.
[03:12:56.338 --> 03:12:57.418]  Let me see if you'll answer this.
[03:12:57.979 --> 03:12:58.439]  Honestly.
[03:12:58.819 --> 03:13:00.100]  Or we'll know you're a seminar caller.
[03:13:01.061 --> 03:13:04.383]  Is it a lie to say raising the debt doesn't raise the debt?
[03:13:04.923 --> 03:13:11.547]  Is that a Orwellian 2 plus 2 equals 5 common core type deal?
[03:13:12.267 --> 03:13:14.629]  I mean, is raising the debt raising the debt, sir?
[03:13:15.871 --> 03:13:17.372]  That's not, that's not what he's saying.
[03:13:17.612 --> 03:13:21.675]  He's saying that the amount the government can borrow is raised.
[03:13:21.755 --> 03:13:22.696]  It doesn't have to raise the debt.
[03:13:22.736 --> 03:13:25.077]  And yes, it will if it borrows money.
[03:13:25.097 --> 03:13:25.598]  Yes, it will.
[03:13:25.758 --> 03:13:27.439]  But they are, they are borrowing money.
[03:13:27.479 --> 03:13:27.839]  No, no, no.
[03:13:28.260 --> 03:13:29.560]  They raised it to borrow more.
[03:13:30.241 --> 03:13:31.122]  It was already borrowed.
[03:13:31.142 --> 03:13:32.342]  They'd frozen it for a few months.
[03:13:33.083 --> 03:13:40.308]  That was another Orwellian lie that freezing it, freezing it, that it wasn't going up, but it was going up.
[03:13:40.668 --> 03:13:42.690]  They just faked the numbers.
[03:13:43.706 --> 03:13:45.628]  Okay, but just go ahead and tell me about Obama.
[03:13:46.349 --> 03:13:57.200]  Do you think, so there are no death panels, there isn't the Newsweek case for killing Granny, NPR everyday isn't promoting euthanasia, none of this is happening, everything's good then?
[03:13:58.641 --> 03:14:01.524]  Alright, first of all, one article of Newsweek does not mean there are death panels.
[03:14:02.145 --> 03:14:02.686]  Second of all...
[03:14:03.785 --> 03:14:09.458]  What you're talking about is, you're talking about end-of-health decisions paid for by the Healthcare Act.
[03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:11.983]  Talking to your doctor about end-of-health decisions.
[03:14:12.465 --> 03:14:13.587]  It's not a death panel.
[03:14:14.654 --> 03:14:15.635]  That's right, that's right.
[03:14:15.755 --> 03:14:19.296]  The doctor and the family has the decision taken away.
[03:14:19.676 --> 03:14:20.176]  That's right.
[03:14:20.377 --> 03:14:21.417]  No, that's not true at all.
[03:14:21.637 --> 03:14:23.518]  The doctor and his family makes the decision.
[03:14:23.538 --> 03:14:25.619]  I don't know where you're face is coming from, but that's not true.
[03:14:26.099 --> 03:14:30.201]  The family and doctors make the decision based on what the family and the doctors feel like as a team.
[03:14:30.221 --> 03:14:31.481]  Alright, that's what that means.
[03:14:31.501 --> 03:14:32.882]  There's no death panels going to kill you all.
[03:14:32.902 --> 03:14:34.343]  Nope, it's the bioethics committee.
[03:14:35.443 --> 03:14:41.245]  Second of all, well, second of all, as far as, I know you're going to ask about Obama,
[03:14:42.967 --> 03:14:44.468]  Overall, he's doing a pretty good job.
[03:14:44.768 --> 03:14:46.670]  He's got some mistakes.
[03:14:46.750 --> 03:14:48.331]  Sure, but overall, he's not bad.
[03:14:48.551 --> 03:14:51.813]  Do you think sodium fluoride in the water supply is a good thing?
[03:14:51.833 --> 03:14:55.275]  I'm not going to debate forward with you because that's long been proven that it is.
[03:14:55.295 --> 03:14:56.276]  I'm not going to debate forward with you.
[03:14:56.576 --> 03:14:58.378]  Second of all... Oh, you're not going to debate?
[03:14:58.398 --> 03:14:59.598]  Well, we're not going to talk anymore.
[03:14:59.618 --> 03:15:02.000]  Because fluoride is safe now.
[03:15:03.301 --> 03:15:04.902]  Okay, what's next on your list?
[03:15:05.302 --> 03:15:06.803]  What's next on your list?
[03:15:06.843 --> 03:15:07.604]  What's your next point?
[03:15:08.621 --> 03:15:10.262]  Well, fluoride, fine.
[03:15:10.282 --> 03:15:11.222]  What's wrong with fluoride?
[03:15:11.442 --> 03:15:12.842]  Fine, let's just talk about fluoride then.
[03:15:14.923 --> 03:15:15.203]  Fluoride!
[03:15:16.483 --> 03:15:18.924]  And don't go to the Harvard study because that's not what the Harvard study says, but go ahead.
[03:15:19.644 --> 03:15:20.065]  Oh, really?
[03:15:20.085 --> 03:15:22.785]  The Harvard study shows an IQ drop.
[03:15:22.845 --> 03:15:27.167]  It indexes, what, 24 other studies, and there are literally thousands of others as well?
[03:15:27.187 --> 03:15:27.267]  Yeah.
[03:15:27.567 --> 03:15:32.969]  What the Harvard study says is that it's 27 cases in China and Iran, and it's massive doses of natural fluoride.
[03:15:32.989 --> 03:15:37.630]  The conclusions of the study say, there are no conclusions based on this that we can apply to the United States.
[03:15:38.887 --> 03:15:45.011]  No, what they said is, they said at 1.6 parts per million is what the study says.
[03:15:45.551 --> 03:15:47.012]  Man, you are unbelievable.
[03:15:47.072 --> 03:15:48.472]  So, so do you have any children?
[03:15:49.573 --> 03:15:50.914]  Yes, I have two kids, as a matter of fact.
[03:15:51.274 --> 03:15:54.175]  And, and, and do you buy the fluoride water at the store for them?
[03:15:55.876 --> 03:15:56.497]  No, I don't buy water.
[03:15:56.517 --> 03:15:58.078]  I use it on tap water, and water's expensive.
[03:16:00.379 --> 03:16:02.280]  Do you even filter out the chlorine and stuff?
[03:16:02.460 --> 03:16:03.360]  Do you think chlorine's good?
[03:16:03.380 --> 03:16:07.643]  I've been up there 42 years, and I'm not sick from fluoride and chlorine.
[03:16:08.510 --> 03:16:18.876]  Let me tell you, cancer of the bladder is way up, and it's directly linked to chlorine, which I think we need to purify the water, but you need to filter that out.
[03:16:19.997 --> 03:16:21.018]  No, I don't think so.
[03:16:21.418 --> 03:16:24.600]  But anyway, back to the... Hold on a minute.
[03:16:25.561 --> 03:16:25.721]  Yeah.
[03:16:26.561 --> 03:16:27.922]  Okay, what about vaccines?
[03:16:28.242 --> 03:16:29.023]  You think those are great?
[03:16:30.143 --> 03:16:31.744]  No matter what I say, you're going to disagree with me.
[03:16:32.005 --> 03:16:32.985]  Let me ask you this question.
[03:16:33.005 --> 03:16:37.428]  Do you think it's good that they're forcibly sterilizing, currently, poor women in California?
[03:16:39.130 --> 03:16:39.390]  What?
[03:16:40.752 --> 03:16:43.996]  Do you think the forced sterilization currently going on?
[03:16:44.016 --> 03:16:47.900]  It's currently eugenic sterilizations going on in California.
[03:16:47.940 --> 03:16:48.701]  Pull up AB1.
[03:16:48.761 --> 03:16:50.223]  No, no, there's not.
[03:16:50.503 --> 03:16:51.364]  Now back to vaccines.
[03:16:51.464 --> 03:16:52.145]  Hold on, sir.
[03:16:52.225 --> 03:16:52.886]  Hold on, sir.
[03:16:53.226 --> 03:16:53.827]  Hold on, sir.
[03:16:54.287 --> 03:16:57.972]  They are currently forcibly sterilizing people in California.
[03:16:59.814 --> 03:17:00.014]  Really?
[03:17:00.990 --> 03:17:05.973]  Okay, I'm sure, along with Alex, I'm sure you have one case you think is all over the state.
[03:17:06.034 --> 03:17:07.635]  Anyway, back to vaccines.
[03:17:07.975 --> 03:17:10.857]  Yes, there are vaccines that have viruses in them.
[03:17:11.097 --> 03:17:11.597]  They're stunned.
[03:17:11.697 --> 03:17:12.378]  That's how it works.
[03:17:13.459 --> 03:17:16.501]  A vaccine does have a live virus to make the body react to it.
[03:17:16.541 --> 03:17:19.082]  It does not have a live virus, it has an attenuated virus.
[03:17:19.523 --> 03:17:23.666]  And the real graphs show that vaccines are increasing, they're actually causing the diseases.
[03:17:24.711 --> 03:17:25.531]  No, that's not true.
[03:17:25.591 --> 03:17:27.412]  I've never been measured for polio or anything like that.
[03:17:27.472 --> 03:17:29.673]  In India, where they took the vaccine.
[03:17:42.794 --> 03:17:43.034]  No.
[03:17:43.514 --> 03:17:44.095]  For medicine, yes.
[03:17:44.115 --> 03:17:44.795]  For socialized medicine, yeah.
[03:17:44.815 --> 03:17:45.635]  Socialism itself, not so much.
[03:18:13.294 --> 03:18:13.654]  Really?
[03:18:14.255 --> 03:18:15.316]  So one, okay.
[03:18:16.217 --> 03:18:18.078]  I mean, how much socialism do we need?
[03:18:19.400 --> 03:18:23.323]  Uh, if we have, well, uh, good health care, it has to be nice.
[03:18:23.544 --> 03:18:24.524]  Other than that, I think we're fine.
[03:18:27.968 --> 03:18:28.708]  I figured it out.
[03:18:28.748 --> 03:18:30.070]  You're a social worker, aren't you?
[03:18:31.371 --> 03:18:32.532]  How did, what, what did you think that?
[03:18:35.395 --> 03:18:35.555]  Yeah.
[03:18:35.595 --> 03:18:37.717]  Because you're on a power trip.
[03:18:38.973 --> 03:18:39.734]  I'm on a power trip.
[03:18:40.034 --> 03:18:42.556]  I'm a part of a thing I think that most everybody.
[03:18:42.696 --> 03:18:43.997]  What kind of social worker are you?
[03:18:45.298 --> 03:18:47.259]  This is what I am, Alex.
[03:18:48.920 --> 03:18:50.721]  Man, you do a lot of bad stuff, don't you?
[03:18:51.702 --> 03:18:52.703]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:18:52.723 --> 03:18:53.503]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:18:53.523 --> 03:18:57.486]  Do you think the family belongs to a bygone arcane age?
[03:18:58.307 --> 03:18:58.387]  No.
[03:18:58.447 --> 03:19:06.793]  Do you agree with MSNBC when they say that the family is not part of the equation now, that it's the state and the community that runs things?
[03:19:08.504 --> 03:19:08.724]  No.
[03:19:08.784 --> 03:19:10.745]  I mean, the community is involved, but no.
[03:19:12.186 --> 03:19:17.609]  What do you think about neighbors see kids playing with the toy guns in the backyard so they're kicked out of school?
[03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:19.630]  One incident?
[03:19:19.650 --> 03:19:20.551]  I don't know all the facts.
[03:19:21.751 --> 03:19:22.692]  Well, no, I mean, it's on record.
[03:19:22.732 --> 03:19:26.754]  I mean, my point is, you don't believe in a right to keep and bear arms, do you?
[03:19:26.874 --> 03:19:28.415]  Or your right means we turn them in, right?
[03:19:30.216 --> 03:19:32.817]  Um, certain firearms should be personally regulated, yes.
[03:19:32.877 --> 03:19:33.317]  Others shouldn't.
[03:19:34.972 --> 03:19:41.075]  So you really see in your life, your personal destiny, is you expand in power as the state expands in power?
[03:19:42.075 --> 03:19:42.275]  No.
[03:19:42.955 --> 03:19:44.296]  What kind of social worker are you?
[03:19:44.316 --> 03:19:45.877]  I work with kids.
[03:19:47.317 --> 03:19:48.058]  You work with kids?
[03:19:49.438 --> 03:19:50.959]  Todd, I don't know how I know all this stuff.
[03:19:51.439 --> 03:19:57.802]  I help them get into school, help them get a place to live, I help them get set up in apartments, help them get cars, help them get their school paid for, yeah.
[03:19:57.862 --> 03:20:03.224]  And everybody else is a kid, and the state is the daddy, and you're going to show us how everything runs.
[03:20:05.426 --> 03:20:07.847]  I want to encourage you to do something.
[03:20:07.907 --> 03:20:10.587]  I want to encourage you to take every vaccine they recommend.
[03:20:10.647 --> 03:20:11.707]  It's more than 50 a year.
[03:20:13.648 --> 03:20:15.108]  I bet you do, buddy.
[03:20:15.128 --> 03:20:18.969]  What do you think of your social worker counterparts?
[03:20:18.989 --> 03:20:19.929]  Do you deal with the small children?
[03:20:20.109 --> 03:20:21.389]  How do you think I knew you were a social worker?
[03:20:35.779 --> 03:20:36.259]  Cold reading?
[03:20:37.560 --> 03:20:37.901]  Pardon me?
[03:20:38.741 --> 03:20:39.322]  Cold reading?
[03:20:39.342 --> 03:20:41.883]  Did you get a clue to what I said and assumed it?
[03:20:43.545 --> 03:20:45.466]  Man, listen.
[03:20:46.006 --> 03:20:49.569]  I've been places that you'll probably never be, okay?
[03:20:50.029 --> 03:20:52.411]  And I've seen things you haven't seen, obviously.
[03:20:52.431 --> 03:20:55.413]  I just feel sorry for you, man, and I appreciate your call.
[03:20:58.035 --> 03:20:59.376]  They are domesticating us.
[03:20:59.436 --> 03:21:00.717]  They are collectivizing us.
[03:21:00.857 --> 03:21:02.098]  That guy was a house slave.
[03:21:03.439 --> 03:21:03.860]  Well, he was.
[03:21:05.154 --> 03:21:06.055]  He was a house slave.
[03:21:06.616 --> 03:21:07.797]  The Romans figured it out.
[03:21:07.897 --> 03:21:13.064]  They would bring the women, but the men are like that now too, into the house, into the castle.
[03:21:13.645 --> 03:21:20.753]  They would teach him that, you know, it's your job to rule over the male slaves and the children that are out there in the barn.
[03:21:21.800 --> 03:21:25.442]  This is done with the Romans and the Goths and the Gauls.
[03:21:25.822 --> 03:21:26.803]  That's the French today.
[03:21:26.823 --> 03:21:33.066]  And they're always the greatest defenders of the system.
[03:21:33.987 --> 03:21:35.148]  And you can just hear it.
[03:21:35.928 --> 03:21:36.748]  It's a spirit.
[03:21:37.449 --> 03:21:39.450]  It's not that I read things he was saying.
[03:21:39.510 --> 03:21:40.791]  It was the enjoyment.
[03:21:45.376 --> 03:21:51.521]  Because I've been in the family court when the family's crying, and they go, it's okay, it's for your own good, but then they also get off on the power.
[03:21:52.102 --> 03:21:53.423]  And I heard the enjoyment.
[03:21:55.685 --> 03:22:01.069]  I heard the enjoyment on seeing everyone having to come to him and being dependent.
[03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:03.572]  The domestication, the power.
[03:22:03.612 --> 03:22:04.432]  He's a priest.
[03:22:05.333 --> 03:22:07.855]  See, I'm a priest of empowerment of human liberty.
[03:22:08.015 --> 03:22:10.678]  I like to see real empowerment.
[03:22:11.744 --> 03:22:12.805]  I believe in the individual.
[03:22:12.865 --> 03:22:14.706]  I believe in decentralizing power.
[03:22:15.007 --> 03:22:16.288]  You believe in centralizing it.
[03:22:19.110 --> 03:22:24.694]  And if you look at the actuaries, you know, that guy was probably 30 years old, 33 years old, 34 years old.
[03:22:26.636 --> 03:22:31.580]  He'll probably die 20, 30 years early, because the soft kill is intensifying now.
[03:22:32.300 --> 03:22:35.323]  If he even lives through what's coming up, if they don't release the bioweapons.
[03:22:37.020 --> 03:22:47.403]  Imagine a government on record that's done thousands of lethal experiments, killing troops, foster kids, you name it, and this guy wants to take shots they're pushing.
[03:22:47.863 --> 03:22:50.084]  He's not going to go look up any of this stuff.
[03:22:50.904 --> 03:22:53.265]  He listens to the show and he thinks I'm full of bull.
[03:22:53.785 --> 03:23:05.369]  And he goes and picks through things and tries to find the whitewash that, you know, the Harvard study puts in there so they don't get sued as a proviso and just says everything's fine.
[03:23:08.968 --> 03:23:13.052]  That guy ought to go back and listen to that and wonder how I can tell.
[03:23:13.973 --> 03:23:18.097]  Man, I just know how government people talk and I know how certain groups of them are because they're programmed.
[03:23:18.618 --> 03:23:19.639]  Let's go to another phone call.
[03:23:20.419 --> 03:23:21.280]  Sorry to be eating on the air.
[03:23:21.320 --> 03:23:22.642]  I just haven't eaten since early this morning.
[03:23:22.662 --> 03:23:23.202]  I'm starving.
[03:23:23.803 --> 03:23:25.344]  Robert, I know that was hard to listen to.
[03:23:25.404 --> 03:23:26.165]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:23:26.566 --> 03:23:27.627]  What did you think of that victim?
[03:23:29.451 --> 03:23:35.912]  Well, I'm telling you, Alex, that chuckle in his voice just really gave me a creeped out feeling.
[03:23:36.012 --> 03:23:37.233]  They're coming for us, too, bud.
[03:23:37.453 --> 03:23:39.933]  They're shutting off the infrastructure, so we need them.
[03:23:39.953 --> 03:23:44.394]  That literally kind of took my breath away.
[03:23:44.954 --> 03:23:48.635]  Like you said, that little chuckle in his voice, you could just hear.
[03:23:48.655 --> 03:23:51.076]  Let me tell you, when they take people's kids, that's what they do.
[03:23:51.476 --> 03:23:56.657]  And I've actually rolled around on the ground and vomited before, after I was around them.
[03:23:56.977 --> 03:23:57.677]  That's why I knew.
[03:23:59.584 --> 03:24:08.546]  It almost gave me the feeling this morning after watching Ted Cruz jump off a line and then John McCain actually got on there.
[03:24:08.566 --> 03:24:19.468]  And just the listening to him and knowing that he spent $21 million to be re-elected in his last campaign when he only gets paid $174,000.
[03:24:19.768 --> 03:24:27.810]  It just makes me sick to see these people in power and to think that they're on this power trip
[03:24:28.208 --> 03:24:35.729]  And it just makes me sick and ill to my stomach to know that they're not out for the goodness of mankind, and they're the goodness for you and me.
[03:24:35.749 --> 03:24:41.310]  They're out just for ultimate control and destruction of this country.
[03:24:41.690 --> 03:24:46.291]  And if you look around the world, they're just picking countries down one at a time.
[03:24:46.311 --> 03:24:56.973]  And if they can take down the United States of America, it's a free-for-all after that, because we're the only ones that are going to be able to pull this off and save the world when it comes down to it.
[03:24:57.737 --> 03:25:05.884]  And hearing his voice and just thinking that there's actually people like that that get off on that, it just makes me sick to my stomach.
[03:25:06.485 --> 03:25:07.606]  It's disgusting.
[03:25:07.626 --> 03:25:13.271]  You notice when I predicted he was a social worker out of the hundreds of jobs that are out there, he got a little shook up.
[03:25:15.713 --> 03:25:23.460]  Yeah, he kept telling you to stop jumping from one subject to another, and he couldn't stay with you.
[03:25:25.093 --> 03:25:30.756]  Your interview yesterday, Alex, and I've got to commend you, that was just bombshell, the information that you broke yesterday.
[03:25:30.836 --> 03:25:31.517]  Thank you, man.
[03:25:31.577 --> 03:25:32.457]  That was awesome.
[03:25:33.858 --> 03:25:34.899]  Well, God bless you, too.
[03:25:35.639 --> 03:25:39.781]  This is an exhilarating job at one level, but it's also very depressing.
[03:25:44.384 --> 03:25:47.626]  It's one thing when they jerk these little babies away from these mothers that have done nothing.
[03:25:49.674 --> 03:26:08.045]  Or the dad goes in to get an insurance test and has marijuana in his blood, so they come and take the two-year-old child, and they're at court, and they're like, we have family, and then the weirdo judge is always the same and gets off on it, and the CPS workers get off on the pain, and you watch them getting off on the pain.
[03:26:08.085 --> 03:26:11.487]  It's like a power trip, and they're always real weak, but they have that giggle.
[03:26:11.687 --> 03:26:13.188]  It's a demonic spirit, basically.
[03:26:14.089 --> 03:26:16.310]  And, I mean, I know them.
[03:26:16.350 --> 03:26:17.871]  I know their uniform by their voice.
[03:26:18.646 --> 03:26:20.507]  And I'm not kidding, folks.
[03:26:20.547 --> 03:26:23.068]  I've cried over this when I've seen them feeding on the families.
[03:26:23.549 --> 03:26:24.769]  I've actually thrown up.
[03:26:24.950 --> 03:26:25.870]  It hurts so bad.
[03:26:26.530 --> 03:26:28.552]  And that's why I've gotten so angry.
[03:26:29.792 --> 03:26:30.293]  But you know what?
[03:26:30.693 --> 03:26:32.994]  Think of being that guy, how pathetic he is.
[03:26:34.195 --> 03:26:40.178]  Think about how small and dumb and gang member-ish it is to feel like he's part of this big government.
[03:26:40.518 --> 03:26:45.241]  When the history of government is so clear, they really believe they're helping people.
[03:26:47.273 --> 03:26:49.415]  Yeah, hey, what's up, Alex?
[03:26:49.435 --> 03:27:02.066]  There's just some things that I want to go over, like, you know, we gotta start paying with cash and preparing our own food and stuff like that.
[03:27:02.707 --> 03:27:04.028]  I mean, part of the thing is,
[03:27:14.147 --> 03:27:17.468]  This is a digital monster and we need to stop feeding it.
[03:27:17.508 --> 03:27:27.229]  No, no, we have to understand the government has good people in it, but it's run by the eugenicist globalist that might as well be aliens from a trillion miles away come to kill us.
[03:27:27.649 --> 03:27:30.730]  I mean, they're that anti-human, that anti-family.
[03:27:31.810 --> 03:27:32.910]  And they're coming for us.
[03:27:33.390 --> 03:27:35.231]  I mean, they are the enemy.
[03:27:35.931 --> 03:27:36.611]  And they know that.
[03:27:36.711 --> 03:27:37.851]  And they don't care about their own people.
[03:27:37.871 --> 03:27:39.292]  They're going to blow stuff up and blame it on us.
[03:27:40.452 --> 03:27:40.972]  They're coming.
[03:27:41.312 --> 03:27:41.792]  They're coming.
[03:27:43.097 --> 03:27:43.557]  Absolutely.
[03:27:43.797 --> 03:27:47.059]  But everybody is always saying, what can we do about it?
[03:27:47.419 --> 03:27:49.720]  We're down here compartmentalized.
[03:27:50.080 --> 03:27:57.063]  We're the people that are funding the money for the societal redistribution of wealth.
[03:27:57.564 --> 03:28:01.245]  What we need to do is stop giving them numbers to crush.
[03:28:01.265 --> 03:28:01.465]  No, I agree.
[03:28:01.605 --> 03:28:02.626]  Anybody that can.
[03:28:04.085 --> 03:28:15.554]  needs to decouple from the system like the illegal aliens do and just comply with nothing and teach your children that the government might as well be aliens from a trillion miles away come to suck your soul.
[03:28:15.674 --> 03:28:24.121]  I mean it is they are the enemy from front to back and and and and they they are they will destroy anything that isn't their board.
[03:28:24.541 --> 03:28:26.603]  They are collectivist
[03:28:29.136 --> 03:28:34.358]  Demons from hell who can only live off us and have convinced themselves how great they are.
[03:28:34.478 --> 03:28:37.239]  I mean, they are just monstrous.
[03:28:40.660 --> 03:28:41.120]  God bless you.
[03:28:41.140 --> 03:28:42.100]  I appreciate your call, Dan.
[03:28:45.621 --> 03:28:48.622]  You know, talking to that spirit earlier was pretty sick, wasn't it?
[03:28:49.043 --> 03:28:50.843]  Let's talk to Max.
[03:28:51.163 --> 03:28:51.944]  You're on the air, Max.
[03:28:51.964 --> 03:28:52.684]  We've only got about a minute.
[03:28:52.704 --> 03:28:53.004]  Go ahead.
[03:28:53.024 --> 03:28:54.824]  Hey, buddy.
[03:28:55.405 --> 03:28:56.145]  I had a dream.
[03:28:56.778 --> 03:29:01.584]  Uh, that I would be judged by the results of my capability, not the contents of my wallet.
[03:29:02.244 --> 03:29:06.950]  And, uh, I recently made an entry for the Health and Human Services Video Contest.
[03:29:07.871 --> 03:29:09.593]  And, uh, it was kind of an info bomb.
[03:29:10.126 --> 03:29:21.176]  And censored myself in fear of retaliation and persecution in a one-second scene where Obama snorts a nanobot slime in the shape of America and blows his nose in $800?
[03:29:21.216 --> 03:29:27.221]  Do you think that sort of self-censorship is a safe bet, or am I holding myself back?
[03:29:27.501 --> 03:29:28.602]  No, no, that's a great way.
[03:29:29.302 --> 03:29:32.304]  Enter all their fake contests and everything with your own info.
[03:29:32.744 --> 03:29:33.725]  Host it publicly.
[03:29:33.985 --> 03:29:34.746]  Just attack them!
[03:29:34.826 --> 03:29:36.567]  I mean, if all of us just do a little bit, it's over.
[03:29:37.127 --> 03:29:38.108]  Just non-comply.
[03:29:38.128 --> 03:29:40.950]  When you see them, let them know that you don't like them.
[03:29:41.550 --> 03:29:42.591]  Don't give them any fear.
[03:29:42.631 --> 03:29:43.771]  They want you to be scared of them.
[03:29:43.992 --> 03:29:46.053]  Just let them know they're filth and you hate them.
[03:29:46.313 --> 03:29:47.354]  That's the most important thing.
[03:29:47.754 --> 03:29:48.634]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.155 --> 03:29:50.736]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.676 --> 03:29:54.258]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
