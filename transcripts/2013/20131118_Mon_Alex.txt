[00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:10.023]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.023 --> 00:00:11.604]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.604 --> 00:00:13.144]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:17.346]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:21.427]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:42.164]  Here we are, another Monday, the 18th day of November 2013.
[00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:49.449]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.870]  Where to start?
[00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:04.058]  Well, we obviously have the tornadoes and damaging storms that have swept across the Midwest, six left dead, hundreds left slightly injured, more than 30 injured seriously.
[00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:09.767]  And debris has been found 116 miles away.
[00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:13.930]  Damaging winds have blasted Cleveland, Pittsburgh.
[00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.054]  We're going to be breaking some of that down today, obviously, but that pales in significance.
[00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:25.279]  We've always had natural disasters and our prayers and thoughts go out to those.
[00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:32.284]  What is the big enchilada is what was my top story yesterday on the Sunday show and is still our top story.
[00:01:32.284 --> 00:01:33.606]  And I'm tempted to open the phones up.
[00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:40.596]  And the second hour for the military to call in, the former military or current military, to give your take on this.
[00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:50.464]  But report Israel-Saudi Arabia cooperating on possible attack on Iran and nuclear weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia.
[00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:53.687]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:55.428]  And so we're going to be talking more about that.
[00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:56.389]  Also, U.S.
[00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.553]  war readiness in jeopardy as pilots flee part of the ongoing purge.
[00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.813]  Michael Maloof is reporting on that at worldnetdaily.com, so we're going to be looking into that.
[00:02:08.813 --> 00:02:13.255]  The producers got a catch on the broadcast.
[00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:14.616]  I appreciate them doing that.
[00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:18.177]  He's under the weather, but he's going to come on the show because it's so important.
[00:02:18.177 --> 00:02:25.601]  James Taig, who was the only other person other than JFK and Governor Conley to be shot 50 years ago this Friday.
[00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.514]  He was basically threatened by the FBI, then the information was kept out of the Warren Commission.
[00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:36.298]  He was finally able to testify later in the Warren Commission, but he was kept out of the first of it.
[00:02:36.298 --> 00:02:37.920]  Made big national headlines at the time.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.382]  He obviously has the intel and knows.
[00:02:41.397 --> 00:02:46.061]  What really happened is anyone who was there and witnessing it would.
[00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:47.622]  He was right there, folks.
[00:02:47.622 --> 00:02:49.283]  Grassy knoll, whole nine yards.
[00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:50.964]  He was just right across the street from it.
[00:02:50.964 --> 00:02:52.906]  Got hit by a bullet fragment in the face.
[00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.128]  There were just bullets flying all over the place.
[00:02:55.128 --> 00:03:03.534]  The limousine, the open-air limousine, the convertible limousine, looked like a Swiss cheese block that had been attacked by rats.
[00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:04.775]  There were so many bullet holes in it.
[00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:09.859]  Of course, they stripped it out and refurbished it immediately as part of the cover-up.
[00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:10.760]  You can see it at the
[00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:15.865]  LBJ Presidential Library today.
[00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:20.307]  And the big news is, everybody knows, at least 90 plus percent know, the government killed Kennedy.
[00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:27.551]  Criminal elements did, but they're actually trying to ban not just free speech at Dealey Plaza, but in downtown Dallas.
[00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:38.477]  The mayor, who I guess is now God, like Kim Jong Un, says you're not allowed to hand out flyers, you're not allowed to have banners, you're not allowed to... And the courts are even saying, well actually you can't do that.
[00:03:38.477 --> 00:03:41.599]  So they've already had to back off some, but we're going there
[00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:44.167]  Wednesday night, I'm going to be down there.
[00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:46.689]  They're already putting barricades up today.
[00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.732]  Thursday night and Friday, I'm going to be down there exercising my First Amendment.
[00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:52.453]  And it won't matter.
[00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:58.116]  I don't even need to go into the whole grassy knoll area where they're going to have 5,000 selected establishment guests.
[00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:02.539]  I'm going to be outside of it where all the media is at, pointing out the censorship.
[00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:07.563]  See, when they engage in censorship and manipulation, they win if you don't challenge it.
[00:04:07.563 --> 00:04:09.524]  It blows up in their face if you do challenge it.
[00:04:10.973 --> 00:04:17.595]  So we're going to be down there, and we've got a lot of interesting First Amendment surprises coming up.
[00:04:17.595 --> 00:04:21.095]  So definitely want to be part of that, folks.
[00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:25.296]  But my issue is James Taig shot.
[00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:27.357]  Imagine, you'd think three people were shot.
[00:04:27.357 --> 00:04:30.017]  JFK, Governor Connally, and James Taig.
[00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:31.958]  You would think somebody who got shot
[00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:36.060]  Would be one of the 5,000.
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.960]  No, he's tried to get in.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.901]  He's not allowed to.
[00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:39.981]  Because he doesn't believe the official story.
[00:04:39.981 --> 00:04:41.702]  Unbelievable litmus test.
[00:04:41.702 --> 00:04:42.883]  Unbelievable proof.
[00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:44.663]  He's popping in at the bottom of the hour.
[00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:52.606]  Then Dr. Christopher Busby has breaking news on nuclear atomic radiological contamination of the West Coast.
[00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:56.388]  This is breaking bombshell.
[00:04:56.388 --> 00:04:58.389]  Bombshell news in the third hour.
[00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:58.849]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.334]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:05.975]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:10.497]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:05:10.497 --> 00:05:16.639]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:27.403]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:30.464]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:34.105]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:48.828]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:05:52.851 --> 00:06:03.299]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:08.323]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:15.509]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:21.255]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:25.279]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:30.004]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:06:30.004 --> 00:06:35.230]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.714]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Scalzin.
[00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:41.216]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:06:41.216 --> 00:06:45.981]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:48.864]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.
[00:06:48.864 --> 00:06:55.872]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWar possible.
[00:06:56.052 --> 00:06:57.994]  We're getting prepared, are you?
[00:06:57.994 --> 00:07:10.689]  InfoWarsShop.com In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:12.531]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:13.611]  Fluoride.
[00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:15.531]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:22.113]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:07:22.113 --> 00:07:25.053]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[00:07:25.053 --> 00:07:27.033]  And the results are on record.
[00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:33.355]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:07:33.355 --> 00:07:35.775]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:07:35.775 --> 00:07:38.715]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:07:38.715 --> 00:07:42.076]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:47.638]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:52.741]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:08:11.622 --> 00:08:15.207]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:15.207 --> 00:08:19.373]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:32.526 --> 00:08:37.488]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Monday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:08:37.488 --> 00:08:55.234]  Dr. Christopher Busby is going to be joining us via video Skype, dealing with some very serious news in scientific studies, dealing with increased radiation on the West Coast.
[00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:57.114]  This is concrete stuff.
[00:08:57.114 --> 00:08:59.255]  Dr. Busby has been very conservative.
[00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:01.516]  He's a nuclear physicist, chemical physicist.
[00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:12.285]  And also an advisor to the European Union and British Parliament on low-level radiation and its aggregate effects.
[00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:18.449]  He's got major breaking news joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:09:22.113 --> 00:09:25.855]  Concerning two years after Fukushima, what's happening to the West Coast.
[00:09:25.855 --> 00:09:39.161]  Remember those prevailing winds and the currents all come in, in Northern Mexico, up the West Coast of the United States, the Southern West Coast, up into the Northern West Coast, into Canada.
[00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.403]  And then all the way up into Alaska.
[00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:47.526]  And humans are designed to really take a lot and to put up with a lot.
[00:09:47.526 --> 00:09:49.827]  Look at how we hurt ourselves with alcohol, cigarettes,
[00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.753]  The things we do to our body with fast food.
[00:09:53.753 --> 00:09:57.856]  I mean, humans tend to not really worry about themselves.
[00:09:57.856 --> 00:10:00.498]  We tend to worry about our children, but not ourselves.
[00:10:00.498 --> 00:10:03.920]  Look at the cell phone radiation, the microwave radiation.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.585]  On record in so many studies, it dizzies the mind, literally in the thousands.
[00:10:09.585 --> 00:10:12.667]  Going back 30 years, that cell phone radiation causes brain tumors.
[00:10:12.667 --> 00:10:17.631]  I mean, it's a fact, but we still use them because they're so convenient.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:26.464]  Killing ourselves to live, I think, is the best way to put it.
[00:10:26.464 --> 00:10:43.712]  And I've talked to a high-level member of the establishment, off record, on a jet ride once, in first class on American Airlines, and he just said, point blank, he said, look, we use people's capacity to adapt against them.
[00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:48.864]  Whatever we do, the public will go along with it because they will adapt to it.
[00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:51.144]  Do you understand that?
[00:10:51.144 --> 00:10:52.945]  And I went, oh, I see.
[00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:54.666]  All adaption isn't good.
[00:10:54.666 --> 00:11:04.689]  Like when the military says we're going to put you under pressure to make you adapt to be stronger, that's good adaptation by an individual, adapting and overcoming.
[00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:11.091]  But they actually get it to where we get accustomed to living under something tyrannical or something poisonous.
[00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:12.752]  It just becomes the new cultural norm.
[00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.752]  He's like, now you've got it.
[00:11:16.752 --> 00:11:19.654]  And so I said, so you're just openly preying on people.
[00:11:19.654 --> 00:11:29.761]  And he said, no, we have found that the public are basically rat like, and this is how they want to be treated, and that you're never going to change them or build them up.
[00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:31.162]  They want to be in squalor.
[00:11:31.162 --> 00:11:32.043]  So that's what they want.
[00:11:32.043 --> 00:11:32.743]  They'll get it.
[00:11:32.743 --> 00:11:36.626]  And we're going to have corporate management over
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:44.081]  The entire culture and government, because we know how to do it better than government.
[00:11:44.081 --> 00:11:55.083]  I said, wait a minute, I'm all for free market and stuff, but big corporations just become government, and then there's no checks and balances, and then it's even more abusive, and then you guys consolidate all the wealth for yourselves.
[00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:57.104]  They actually got angry at that point.
[00:11:57.104 --> 00:12:02.005]  That's what I found with Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group at the time when I had him on, on and off air.
[00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:23.403]  And that's what I found with this other guy, who was even more high-level than Rothkopf, is that they literally, they're very charming, they're very smart, they're very devilish, they will sit there and they will try to sell you on how you don't get it and how you could be one of them, and how the mere fact that you're aware of all this stuff means you're a potential elitist, and that's how they get everybody to sell out.
[00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:44.286]  I can't tell you how many prominent people with top test scores or who are actors, even mid-level, or who are top academics, you all get approached, they all get approached and basically told, you could be Senator, you could be President.
[00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:47.628]  And that doesn't really mean you could be Senator, you could be President.
[00:12:47.628 --> 00:12:50.529]  That's literally just what they say to everybody.
[00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:54.311]  What it means is you can be a functionary, high-level, in the power structure.
[00:13:03.194 --> 00:13:07.158]  And this has happened to thousands of people.
[00:13:07.158 --> 00:13:13.363]  Tens of thousands of people have been approached basically just to see if you'll get in line.
[00:13:13.363 --> 00:13:20.350]  I mean, I remember the Democratic Party when I was criticizing Bill Clinton off record.
[00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:25.815]  I was at the Capitol, the state Capitol, and I was given the card by a high-powered person in government.
[00:13:26.892 --> 00:13:28.934]  And they said, give me your number.
[00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:30.396]  And I had a card at the time.
[00:13:30.396 --> 00:13:33.559]  He goes, I'm going to have somebody call you about some news.
[00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:35.041]  And then patted me on the shoulder.
[00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:36.443]  And then I got this phone call.
[00:13:36.443 --> 00:13:38.525]  I'm just remembering this first time it ever happened.
[00:13:38.525 --> 00:13:40.907]  I've been on air about a year on Access Television.
[00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:55.848]  And I was basically told, stop being a Republican, come join the Democrats right now, we'll run you for office, we can tell you've got potential, and we're going to take really good care of you, we like you, we want to be your friend.
[00:13:55.848 --> 00:14:04.716]  I went on AXS TV like two nights later and attacked Bill Clinton again, and would show clips of him off C-SPAN with the Communist Chinese meeting with him and stuff, and that was out.
[00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:15.930]  And talked about Waco, and the guy literally, when I got home that night, because he had my home number then, I'd called on that and he'd written it down.
[00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.812]  He'd called me, that's right, because I'd given him my number, that was my home number.
[00:14:18.812 --> 00:14:22.294]  The point was, is that he calls back and goes, how dare you do that!
[00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.554]  How dare you!
[00:14:23.554 --> 00:14:25.175]  You keep doing that, we're not going to work with you!
[00:14:25.175 --> 00:14:32.940]  And folks, this was a high-level person that the extremely high-level Democrat had call me.
[00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:35.892]  I don't know why I'm telling these stories.
[00:14:35.892 --> 00:14:40.893]  It's just, that's how the real world actually works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:40.893 --> 00:14:54.118]  And it's very, very frustrating that the radiation levels went up in the milk, in the water, in the surface, shrubs, and vegetables.
[00:14:54.118 --> 00:14:56.820]  The FDA and EPA actually tested them.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.420]  They both test.
[00:14:58.325 --> 00:15:05.288]  They found, what was it, six times the safe levels in the yellow fin tuna and the blue fin tuna.
[00:15:05.288 --> 00:15:09.010]  Caught off San Diego and suppressed that news for a year.
[00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:17.914]  And then they had the FDA just raise the levels of what they say are acceptable, you know, safe radiation.
[00:15:17.914 --> 00:15:25.618]  And I at least went and looked at the trade winds and where they come in over Texas and tried to go get some radiological metering from the University of Texas.
[00:15:27.754 --> 00:15:36.764]  And they only found slightly increased in Texas because the most the winds are going north of Texas from Japan.
[00:15:36.764 --> 00:15:42.971]  But boy, I tell you folks, if you're on the West Coast, I mean, they picked up high levels of radiation in Vermont in the milk after this stuff happened.
[00:15:44.212 --> 00:15:45.972]  And yeah, there's the headlines right there.
[00:15:45.972 --> 00:15:50.613]  Governments worldwide raise acceptable radiation levels based on politics.
[00:15:50.613 --> 00:15:59.535]  Washington blog at Infowars.com, it says, instead of protecting people, governments cover up by raising safe radiation levels based on politics, not science.
[00:15:59.535 --> 00:16:02.135]  And then let's scroll down.
[00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:09.816]  And then you can see all the links he's got to mainstream news and government announcements and TEPCO and over in Japan, where they all admit it.
[00:16:09.816 --> 00:16:13.157]  And I always like Washington's blog, because at the bottom, he'll show a bibliography.
[00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:16.758]  Where he got all of his sources.
[00:16:16.758 --> 00:16:21.322]  And then you can link right through to it in all those reports.
[00:16:21.322 --> 00:16:27.787]  But again, I've got all this breaking huge news, and I'm going to get to it right now.
[00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:33.232]  It's just... I want to say this to the establishment, though.
[00:16:33.232 --> 00:16:37.315]  You're breathing this radiation, too.
[00:16:37.315 --> 00:16:39.497]  You're eating the GMO, even though you try to avoid it.
[00:16:39.497 --> 00:16:40.758]  You know your kids aren't avoiding it.
[00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:47.116]  You know, only the most disciplined people can avoid this stuff.
[00:16:47.116 --> 00:16:49.197]  And you're getting blowback from all this.
[00:16:49.197 --> 00:16:58.840]  So, what it is, is people that join the establishment, imagine that by joining the establishment, they have protected themselves from all of these problems.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.920]  And that's actually what I found.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.481]  Oh, that's another thing they always say.
[00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:11.123]  Oh, you'll protect your family by joining the establishment, and then you can work from the inside for good by compromising.
[00:17:13.416 --> 00:17:23.780]  And really, you don't ever get to affect any change working in the establishment from the research and the history I've looked at until things get really bad and folks figure out they're in deep trouble.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:35.204]  Then things do start to change because the worst common denominator within the power structure tends to then be the leader of the pack.
[00:17:35.204 --> 00:17:36.904]  And that's what I'm trying to get at here.
[00:17:36.904 --> 00:17:38.385]  Now, separately,
[00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.872]  From all of that, here is the top news.
[00:17:43.872 --> 00:17:44.092]  U.S.
[00:17:44.092 --> 00:17:45.793]  stocks back off.
[00:17:45.793 --> 00:17:49.115]  Psychological hurdles as builder confidence goes flat.
[00:17:49.115 --> 00:17:52.016]  Yeah, the economy is going into cardiac arrest.
[00:17:52.016 --> 00:17:58.499]  Obamacare, if it doesn't kill the economy, shutting down the power plants will.
[00:17:58.499 --> 00:18:02.701]  And then we've got this big story that's super ultra creepy up on InfoWars.com.
[00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:03.822]  TSA rolls out
[00:18:04.676 --> 00:18:07.939]  Detention pods at airport terminals.
[00:18:07.939 --> 00:18:13.545]  And I actually told you about this about four years ago because it was in major magazines and things.
[00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:23.795]  I could just read what DHS was describing and see some of the new test facilities they were building.
[00:18:23.795 --> 00:18:30.298]  And it's these tunnels you go through where you just basically get snatched and disappeared for further, quote, screening.
[00:18:30.298 --> 00:18:32.539]  So you think, oh, it's going to wave me right through.
[00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:35.120]  It says that my background check has been done.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.080]  I'm safe.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:42.143]  But then you just basically then get cordoned off into jail cells if they want.
[00:18:43.297 --> 00:18:49.484]  And now they're putting in these jail cells, even after you are trying to leave the airport now.
[00:18:49.484 --> 00:19:03.719]  When you've gotten off the plane, you go into these big steel doors that look like something out of a science fiction movie, and then it closes to decide if you're authorized to leave, and then the other door opens, and then they admit that's what it's for.
[00:19:03.719 --> 00:19:05.881]  Total prisoner training.
[00:19:08.004 --> 00:19:11.225]  And remember, this is for the Al-Qaeda threat that the globalists openly have funded.
[00:19:11.225 --> 00:19:13.646]  I mean, go look at who set up Saudi Arabia.
[00:19:13.646 --> 00:19:15.127]  British intelligence.
[00:19:15.127 --> 00:19:20.429]  Out of a group of Bedouin tribalists.
[00:19:20.429 --> 00:19:22.349]  Look at who runs this whole show.
[00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:24.310]  It's so frustrating, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.431]  Al-Qaeda, the Wahhabis, are 100% made by the British Crown.
[00:19:27.431 --> 00:19:27.531]  In 1903.
[00:19:27.531 --> 00:19:28.472]  The, uh... Sons
[00:19:39.972 --> 00:19:50.359]  And grandsons of the Bedouin leader are now in charge over there and they've now got nuclear weapons and are threatening to nuke Iran.
[00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:52.060]  So that's the type of news we have.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:57.484]  And then we've also got actor Lennox responds to claims that he trained Obama.
[00:19:57.484 --> 00:19:58.084]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.084 --> 00:19:58.485]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:01.680]  My name's Bruno.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.042]  I'm 52 years old.
[00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:06.668]  I've tried different protein powders over the years, and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[00:20:06.668 --> 00:20:08.951]  I tried One World Whey and found it to be delicious.
[00:20:08.951 --> 00:20:14.920]  After 10 weeks on One World Whey, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.483]  My body has changed dramatically.
[00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:17.923]  I'm a cyclist.
[00:20:17.923 --> 00:20:20.944]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[00:20:20.944 --> 00:20:31.067]  After being on One World Way, I rode ten days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of One World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[00:20:31.067 --> 00:20:33.268]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[00:20:33.268 --> 00:20:37.449]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[00:20:37.449 --> 00:20:38.949]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:20:38.949 --> 00:20:40.990]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.870]  Just give it a try.

[00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:03.534]  My name is Frank Bates, and I got a confession to make.
[00:23:03.534 --> 00:23:11.386]  Just a few days ago, FEMA went directly to my supplier and tried to buy up my entire stockpile of high-quality survival food.
[00:23:11.386 --> 00:23:15.111]  It sounds crazy, but I'll show you the exact letter they sent in a minute.
[00:23:15.652 --> 00:23:21.877]  Revealing FEMA's plot could land me in hot water and I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[00:23:21.877 --> 00:23:31.644]  Go to FEMAHatesThis.com to see undeniable video proof that the government is on the hunt for as much survival food as they can grab in 24 hours.
[00:23:31.644 --> 00:23:37.368]  Be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't.
[00:23:37.688 --> 00:23:48.775]  Go to FemaHatesThis.com to see why survival food is the number one item to hoard right now and why supplies are so low or even completely sold out already at many stores across America.
[00:23:48.775 --> 00:23:56.079]  Do it now because I don't know how long it will be online so go to FemaHatesThis.com while you can.
[00:23:56.079 --> 00:23:57.940]  That's FemaHatesThis.com.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:43.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, and we have the third person shot 50 years ago in 1963 in Dallas, coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:51.357]  Let me get to this story right now that's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that really is national news.
[00:24:51.357 --> 00:24:53.739]  The TSA is prisoner training.
[00:24:53.739 --> 00:24:56.341]  They're rolling out on the streets, the highways, the bus terminals.
[00:24:57.182 --> 00:25:00.085]  They're federalizing where, quote, infrastructure jobs.
[00:25:00.085 --> 00:25:03.588]  You've got to get TSA approval to have that job as a background check.
[00:25:03.588 --> 00:25:08.433]  That's expanding even to people that work at national parks, people that work at factories.
[00:25:08.433 --> 00:25:13.037]  This is a federal registry where you don't work if they don't want you to.
[00:25:13.037 --> 00:25:17.482]  You don't leave the country if the IRS has an investigation open on you.
[00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:19.283]  This is what they openly are announcing.
[00:25:20.188 --> 00:25:24.872]  It's for capital controls, to not let you get out of the country, or get money out of the country.
[00:25:24.872 --> 00:25:28.174]  The TSA's announced this is their plans.
[00:25:28.174 --> 00:25:35.180]  Now when you leave the airport, or go into different areas, doors close that are only one way.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.923]  And notice the local news introduces this perfectly, like, what is it?
[00:25:38.923 --> 00:25:40.224]  It looks fun!
[00:25:40.224 --> 00:25:41.765]  Oh, people like it!
[00:25:41.765 --> 00:25:47.550]  You go in, it locks, and then when it's ready, it authorizes for you to leave.
[00:25:49.229 --> 00:25:52.290]  And that's what putting you in the glass box was about first.
[00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:52.850]  Getting you ready.
[00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.311]  Go to that area, which is a glass box around you.
[00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:56.351]  It's a cage.
[00:25:56.351 --> 00:25:58.972]  It's the cone of shame.
[00:25:58.972 --> 00:26:01.393]  It's, you know, directly from the movie Up.
[00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:01.853]  Squirrel!
[00:26:01.853 --> 00:26:02.833]  Squirrel!
[00:26:02.833 --> 00:26:04.494]  You gotta see it to know what I'm talking about.
[00:26:04.494 --> 00:26:06.314]  It is the dunce hat in the corner.
[00:26:06.314 --> 00:26:07.435]  This is all admitted.
[00:26:07.435 --> 00:26:10.335]  This is so social engineering.
[00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:11.416]  This is total control.
[00:26:12.578 --> 00:26:15.521]  And this is TSA prisoner training.
[00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:19.345]  The TSA has bought over a hundred as of two years ago.
[00:26:20.476 --> 00:26:31.104]  Mobile 18-wheeler trailers, that you walk in one area, it retina scans you, it has a lie detector, quack machine, and then they ask you questions about, do you have recording devices?
[00:26:31.104 --> 00:26:32.025]  Are you a terrorist?
[00:26:32.025 --> 00:26:37.729]  Which again, treats you like you're a criminal, and psychologically makes you feel like you've done something wrong.
[00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:40.851]  This is government teaching us all we're perpetrators.
[00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:41.732]  We're bad.
[00:26:41.732 --> 00:26:44.174]  When historically, big government's the number one perpetrator.
[00:26:45.356 --> 00:26:55.642]  Imagine if you asked one of these TSA people at a concert or a football game, hey, I don't want to be put on a brain scanner, I don't want to be put on a voice print, I don't want to have you also grope me.
[00:26:55.642 --> 00:26:58.304]  First you go on, they grope you, then they set you down.
[00:26:58.304 --> 00:27:00.265]  We've played these training videos before.
[00:27:00.265 --> 00:27:03.327]  This is rolling out.
[00:27:03.327 --> 00:27:11.572]  Then they go, oh, further screening and send you to a cage area, where then they talk to you over a TV set and then say, we're scanning you for lying.
[00:27:12.955 --> 00:27:13.996]  I don't have a recorder.
[00:27:13.996 --> 00:27:14.517]  Yes, you do.
[00:27:14.517 --> 00:27:15.217]  You have a smartphone.
[00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:16.399]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:27:16.399 --> 00:27:19.301]  Don't you ever lie to me again!
[00:27:19.301 --> 00:27:25.027]  Again, this is how they're going to train us for FEMA camps, folks, is just roll it out slowly where it's normal.
[00:27:25.027 --> 00:27:26.729]  Oh, we have a highway checkpoint.
[00:27:26.729 --> 00:27:30.252]  DHS bought over a thousand this year.
[00:27:30.252 --> 00:27:34.356]  Mobile Highway Command Bulletproof Pillboxes.
[00:27:35.302 --> 00:27:44.324]  That they have two 18-wheelers come and basically plug in and creates a V with armored shielding and windows on it.
[00:27:44.324 --> 00:27:47.284]  This is classic military takeover.
[00:27:47.284 --> 00:27:49.565]  They're pre-deploying weaponry everywhere.
[00:27:49.565 --> 00:27:54.446]  They've had a Marine Corps colonel go public and warn people a few months ago to his city council.
[00:27:54.446 --> 00:27:55.586]  I mean, this is happening.
[00:27:55.586 --> 00:27:58.606]  For anybody that studied warfighting, folks, we know what this is.
[00:27:58.606 --> 00:28:00.687]  The pre-caching, the preparation.
[00:28:00.687 --> 00:28:01.887]  Here is the new video.
[00:28:02.944 --> 00:28:05.866]  Where they are promoting all of this.
[00:28:05.866 --> 00:28:10.830]  After people get off a plane, the new airport exits are getting some strange looks.
[00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.692]  Some think they look like a science fiction intergalactic time machine.
[00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:17.454]  I was expecting to get transported somewhere like on Star Trek.
[00:28:17.454 --> 00:28:19.316]  I thought, yeah, we finally got here.
[00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:24.820]  Others were wondering if it was an x-ray chamber or might fill up with dollar bills like on a game show.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:31.622]  Yeah, it was odd, I'm like... Yeah, by the way, it's meant to look like the naked scanner to condition you to accept the other one.
[00:28:31.622 --> 00:28:34.643]  Because it looks just like the scanner.
[00:28:34.643 --> 00:28:36.323]  Everybody refuses, you understand?
[00:28:36.323 --> 00:28:37.284]  So you can't even tell.
[00:28:37.284 --> 00:28:38.144]  That is the plan.
[00:28:38.144 --> 00:28:39.905]  Psychologists come up with this.
[00:28:54.369 --> 00:28:58.970]  We need to be vigilant and maintain high security protocol at all times.
[00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:04.351]  These portals were designed and approved by TSA, which is important.
[00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:08.752]  Syracuse is one of the first airports in the country to have the new portals.
[00:29:08.752 --> 00:29:12.353]  Previously, the exit was monitored by police or security guards.
[00:29:12.353 --> 00:29:17.514]  Syracuse's airport commissioner says the new portals should also save money in the long term.
[00:29:17.514 --> 00:29:18.814]  That's enough.
[00:29:18.814 --> 00:29:20.434]  You know, Ted Anderson was there.
[00:29:20.434 --> 00:29:22.975]  We had dinner about 12 years ago.
[00:29:23.956 --> 00:29:30.845]  With a very famous psychiatrist in upstate Minnesota at a lodge.
[00:29:30.845 --> 00:29:31.586]  He wanted to meet me.
[00:29:31.586 --> 00:29:35.451]  He worked with the government in subliminal messaging and television.
[00:29:36.562 --> 00:29:40.384]  And he basically described and explained a lot of things to both of us.
[00:29:40.384 --> 00:29:42.586]  But the issue is, that's what that whole thing is.
[00:29:42.586 --> 00:29:45.187]  It's total conditioning for you to be a total prisoner.
[00:29:45.187 --> 00:29:47.309]  And they look just like naked body scanners.
[00:29:47.309 --> 00:29:50.030]  So whether you like it or not, you must go through them.
[00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.411]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.411 --> 00:29:52.232]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.232 --> 00:29:53.232]  Total conditioning.
[00:29:53.232 --> 00:29:54.053]  Total acclimation.
[00:29:54.053 --> 00:29:55.534]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.534 --> 00:29:56.414]  Total brainwashing.
[00:29:56.414 --> 00:29:56.935]  Total war.
[00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:08.082]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:30:08.082 --> 00:30:25.971]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:30:25.971 --> 00:30:30.073]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:30:30.353 --> 00:30:32.114]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:30:32.114 --> 00:30:40.280]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:46.604]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:30:46.604 --> 00:30:47.885]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:30:47.885 --> 00:30:48.745]  It's incredible.

[00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:16.703]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:31:16.703 --> 00:31:22.387]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:31:22.387 --> 00:31:26.029]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:31:26.209 --> 00:31:30.013]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

[00:31:44.488 --> 00:31:45.389]  By Rosa Kory.
[00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:48.351]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:31:48.351 --> 00:31:49.633]  The Greater Good.
[00:31:49.633 --> 00:31:55.178]  The most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:31:55.178 --> 00:31:59.421]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com
[00:32:01.007 --> 00:32:07.631]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:32:07.631 --> 00:32:10.013]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:32:10.013 --> 00:32:10.473]  The U.S.
[00:32:10.473 --> 00:32:14.716]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:32:14.716 --> 00:32:17.678]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:32:17.678 --> 00:32:19.159]  They want that attack to come.
[00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:25.343]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:32:25.731 --> 00:32:28.413]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:32:28.413 --> 00:32:33.376]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:32:33.376 --> 00:32:40.801]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:43.884]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:32:43.884 --> 00:32:46.968]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:32:46.968 --> 00:32:51.553]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[00:33:11.597 --> 00:33:12.878]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:12.878 --> 00:33:17.380]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.534 --> 00:33:46.056]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday Worldwide broadcast.
[00:33:46.056 --> 00:33:55.819]  Coming up in the next hour, we'll open the phones up and get into TSA rolls out detention pods, that's their words, at airport terminal exits.
[00:33:55.819 --> 00:34:00.340]  So slaves go in, slaves don't go out, where they can now just close you off.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.641]  And they're coming out with whole tunnels.
[00:34:02.341 --> 00:34:09.645]  Where you go and then a wall comes in and then they divert you off into a jail cell and your family wonders where you went.
[00:34:09.645 --> 00:34:13.247]  You know, daddy goes in first and then you come in and then where's daddy?
[00:34:13.247 --> 00:34:13.987]  Don't worry about it.
[00:34:13.987 --> 00:34:19.950]  It's all a very calm way to not freak everyone out at the TSA lines.
[00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:30.216]  This is how you turn lines into Nazi, German, Soviet, authoritarian, fascist, communist, oppressive style turnstiles.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.601]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:43.507]  That's why the FEMA admits they want to use the sports stadiums during emergencies for a mass processing of citizens in the Emergency Centers Establishment Act that anyone can go read for themselves.
[00:34:43.507 --> 00:34:49.069]  Also, Mark Faber fears the end of the capitalistic economic system as we know it.
[00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:50.970]  We've got video of that from Zero Hedge.
[00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:52.631]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:52.631 --> 00:34:57.254]  The latest on Obamacare as Pelosi seeks to keep Democrats in line amid healthcare turmoil.
[00:34:58.439 --> 00:35:09.409]  And of course the big news, report Israel, Saudi Arabia cooperating on possible attack on Iran, nuclear weapons transfers from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia.
[00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:13.133]  The purchases have reportedly already been made.
[00:35:14.502 --> 00:35:21.565]  Now, we're joined right now by a person who is, well, really a historic figure.
[00:35:21.565 --> 00:35:26.967]  James Jim Thomas Tague was a witness to the assassination of U.S.
[00:35:26.967 --> 00:35:31.689]  President John F. Kennedy in Dallas 50 years ago this Friday.
[00:35:31.689 --> 00:35:39.353]  And he received a wound on his right cheek during the assassination from a ricochet of a bullet intended for Kennedy.
[00:35:39.353 --> 00:35:42.054]  Absolutely, a lot of bullet holes in the concrete.
[00:35:42.859 --> 00:35:44.721]  I think you can still see some of them.
[00:35:44.721 --> 00:35:54.091]  He is the only person, in addition to Kennedy and Texas Governor John B. Connally, known to have been wounded by gunfire in Dallas' Dealey Plaza that day.
[00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:55.812]  And guess what else, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:35:55.812 --> 00:36:01.859]  Daily Caller reports JFK assassination eyewitness won't be at 50th anniversary.
[00:36:04.278 --> 00:36:24.735]  That's right, he cannot get a ticket from the controlled public ceremony, 5,000 people are being selectively given them, and anyone who criticizes the official story that only about 9% of people on average in scientific polls agree with, 90% or more do not believe the official story, including the Secretary of State.
[00:36:24.735 --> 00:36:27.378]  John Kerry doesn't believe it, but that doesn't matter.
[00:36:28.956 --> 00:36:30.758]  Doesn't matter, you're not allowed to be there.
[00:36:30.758 --> 00:36:33.801]  And now we've got our reporters actually going up there tomorrow.
[00:36:33.801 --> 00:36:35.562]  I'll be there Wednesday night.
[00:36:35.562 --> 00:36:38.385]  The barricades are already going up and we talked to insiders.
[00:36:38.385 --> 00:36:44.871]  I've already had one of my crew members up there last week who talked to the hotels, talked to the police off record and others.
[00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:52.038]  The word is they're going to push the barricades up to six, seven blocks back and have checkpoints so they can have the international media there and control this.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.481]  Jim Tagg joins us right now.
[00:36:56.481 --> 00:37:06.424]  Imagine, the only other person wounded that day, the third person shot, and the Warren Commission didn't even know about him until later, and then he testified.
[00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:10.485]  This is how controlled the FBI whitewash was.
[00:37:10.485 --> 00:37:12.566]  And he joins us now, sir.
[00:37:12.566 --> 00:37:13.326]  Thank you for coming on.
[00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:17.171]  Well, sir, you've got the floor.
[00:37:17.171 --> 00:37:23.373]  Talk about your experience that day, your book, where you break down what really happened, and then now this attack on free speech.
[00:37:23.373 --> 00:37:26.894]  It looks like the shadow government didn't just kill our president.
[00:37:26.894 --> 00:37:29.454]  Fifty years later, they're killing our First Amendment.
[00:37:29.454 --> 00:37:35.156]  Well, my new book, LBJ and the Kennedy Killing,
[00:37:37.312 --> 00:37:40.875]  I start from the first to go all the way through.
[00:37:40.875 --> 00:37:47.339]  A lot of people, well let me back up, people 15 years old then are 65 now.
[00:37:47.339 --> 00:37:53.883]  So a lot of information that was not known I put into a book.
[00:37:53.883 --> 00:37:57.046]  101 stories in 101 chapters.
[00:37:57.046 --> 00:37:59.707]  Now, let me go back to that day.
[00:37:59.707 --> 00:38:02.109]  I was there by accident.
[00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:03.630]  I just got stopped in traffic.
[00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.991]  Wasn't planning on seeing Tiffany.
[00:38:06.834 --> 00:38:12.099]  And, uh, my car was stopped under the triple underpass.
[00:38:12.099 --> 00:38:19.745]  Got out, off four or five steps to get into the, uh, visibility of the Dealey Plaza.
[00:38:19.745 --> 00:38:23.448]  No more than done that, and somebody throws a firecracker.
[00:38:23.448 --> 00:38:24.849]  Pop!
[00:38:24.849 --> 00:38:28.472]  Well, that's what it sounded like, but it was the first shot.
[00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:33.776]  And I'm thinking to myself, what kind of idiot would be throwing a firecracker with the President driving by?
[00:38:34.949 --> 00:38:41.274]  No more to get those thoughts out of my mind and crack, crack of two rifle shots.
[00:38:41.274 --> 00:38:44.436]  Something stings me in the face.
[00:38:44.436 --> 00:38:47.558]  Well, that catches my attention.
[00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:50.020]  There's something going on.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:53.823]  Anyway, I'm standing there for a moment, stunned.
[00:38:53.823 --> 00:38:57.085]  A man in a suit comes running up to him.
[00:38:57.085 --> 00:39:00.768]  It turns out he's a deputy sheriff named Buddy Walters.
[00:39:03.164 --> 00:39:05.305]  And he asked me, he says, what's going on down here?
[00:39:05.305 --> 00:39:07.566]  I said, I don't know.
[00:39:07.566 --> 00:39:17.349]  We stand there for a moment and notice that the motorcycle policeman's talking to a couple people, what is now known as a grassy knoll.
[00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:29.613]  We wait for traffic to clear, which has been released after the motorcade, and get across the street just in time to hear this man sobbing, his head exploded, his head exploded.
[00:39:31.065 --> 00:39:32.906]  And the policeman says, who's head?
[00:39:32.906 --> 00:39:35.487]  And he says, the president's.
[00:39:35.487 --> 00:39:40.889]  And I'll never forget the deputy sheriff, Buddy, while I was turning through the grass.
[00:39:40.889 --> 00:39:49.853]  There beside the sidewalk and kicking the grass with his toe, hard as he could, damn, damn, damn.
[00:39:49.853 --> 00:39:53.114]  He looked up at me and he says, you got blood on your face.
[00:39:53.114 --> 00:39:55.975]  And I reached up with a palm of my hand, sure enough.
[00:39:55.975 --> 00:39:57.616]  And I remember something stinging me.
[00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:03.001]  Doing the crack-crack of two rifle shots.
[00:40:03.001 --> 00:40:04.962]  Buddy asked me, he says, where were you standing?
[00:40:04.962 --> 00:40:08.183]  And I said, back over where you ran up to me.
[00:40:08.183 --> 00:40:17.547]  And so we wait for traffic to clear again and before we can get over to the point between Main and Commerce.
[00:40:17.547 --> 00:40:21.588]  It's very narrow right there before it goes under the underpass.
[00:40:21.588 --> 00:40:23.569]  Buddy speaks up and says, look there on the curb.
[00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:28.031]  You can see from across the street a bullet mark on the curb.
[00:40:29.535 --> 00:40:47.363]  And we stand there, look at it, we both felt of it, tried to line it up, and finally we go back across the street where people start together and comparing notes what just happened.
[00:40:47.363 --> 00:40:52.826]  I'm asked to stick around, they wanted his statement from me.
[00:40:52.826 --> 00:40:55.147]  Well, about 20 minutes after the shooting,
[00:40:56.084 --> 00:41:00.646]  I suddenly remember my car still setting out in the street.
[00:41:00.646 --> 00:41:06.508]  So I go jump in it to move it, get it out of the way, and re-park, and I couldn't.
[00:41:06.508 --> 00:41:13.810]  Crowds of people had suddenly come upon Dealey Plaza, and it was a traffic jam.
[00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:20.612]  So I drove on down to the police station, told the desk sergeant where I was there.
[00:41:20.612 --> 00:41:25.494]  He sent me up to Homicide, and I sat in Homicide for
[00:41:26.368 --> 00:41:34.893]  Perhaps 30 minutes until a sergeant walks in or a detective named Gus Rose walks in.
[00:41:34.893 --> 00:41:41.276]  And the detective takes out a yellow pad and takes briefly the notes.
[00:41:41.276 --> 00:41:42.317]  It was very simple.
[00:41:42.317 --> 00:41:48.540]  I just got stopped in traffic and something that started me on tape, blah, blah, blah.
[00:41:49.688 --> 00:42:01.995]  And as we're about to end up, there's a noise there at the door of Homicide and two policemen bring a man in in handcuffs behind his back.
[00:42:01.995 --> 00:42:03.956]  Detective Rose says, what you got there?
[00:42:03.956 --> 00:42:11.220]  One of the policemen says, this is the man that killed the policeman over in Oak Cliff a while ago.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.842]  So anyway, I was excused at that point and went home.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.140]  I don't know.
[00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:34.952]  He wrote down everything I could remember from that day.
[00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:35.612]  Well, I know why.
[00:42:35.612 --> 00:42:36.413]  That's common sense.
[00:42:36.413 --> 00:42:40.194]  You just saw the President get executed, and you want to keep everything fresh.
[00:42:40.194 --> 00:42:41.674]  That's exactly what Abba did.
[00:42:41.674 --> 00:42:44.175]  Well, that's what I did.
[00:42:44.175 --> 00:42:48.296]  Still got it today.
[00:42:48.296 --> 00:42:54.038]  Anyway, through the years, I collected a lot of notes, this, that, and the other.
[00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:55.918]  Put it out of my mind for years.
[00:42:55.918 --> 00:42:57.239]  This was something in the past.
[00:42:58.858 --> 00:43:09.366]  I did not allow it to interfere with my family or my career, but my wife kept a lot of notes and did it in the books.
[00:43:09.366 --> 00:43:16.712]  In 1988, I'm on a plane going to New York and get talking to the lady next to me.
[00:43:16.712 --> 00:43:25.439]  Turns out she's Madeline Brown, Lyndon Johnson's mistress for 21 years.
[00:43:25.439 --> 00:43:27.801]  The tale she told me was almost unbelievable.
[00:43:29.122 --> 00:43:34.785]  I absorbed it, put it in the back of my mind, but did not let it get to me.
[00:43:34.785 --> 00:43:41.069]  And by the way, I knew her and interviewed her in person many times, and she even had a son with LBJ.
[00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:42.089]  Even.
[00:43:42.089 --> 00:43:53.635]  Absolutely, and I had family that lived in Austin at the time, and pretty much everybody then that was such a small town knew about LBJ and the things he was up to, but it's on record that that really was his mistress.
[00:43:53.635 --> 00:43:55.236]  That's correct.
[00:43:55.236 --> 00:43:55.816]  That's correct.
[00:43:58.141 --> 00:44:00.783]  She had a long tale to tell, which I'm sure you've heard.
[00:44:00.783 --> 00:44:04.826]  You've probably heard what she had to say.
[00:44:04.826 --> 00:44:12.232]  Well, you know, about him getting drunk and telling her the planning and things that they did.
[00:44:12.232 --> 00:44:12.812]  That's correct.
[00:44:12.812 --> 00:44:14.734]  That goes back to the meeting the night before.
[00:44:27.508 --> 00:44:30.889]  That's what the record says.
[00:44:30.889 --> 00:44:42.071]  J Edgar Hoover and Nixon and a bunch of people were there and supposedly a party for Hoover and the party was over and actually in the morning hours I think
[00:44:55.882 --> 00:45:02.405]  At 1230 in the morning, Lyndon Johnson comes walking in to the party.
[00:45:02.405 --> 00:45:04.085]  It breaks up.
[00:45:04.085 --> 00:45:06.646]  And they have a secret meeting.
[00:45:06.646 --> 00:45:19.792]  And the people we just mentioned go into this meeting, and the meeting was really the planning covering up the assassination.
[00:45:19.792 --> 00:45:25.494]  When the meeting's over, Lyndon Johnson comes walking over to Madeline, who'd been waiting in the living room.
[00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:39.151]  And as you said, we can't say it on TV, but as you recall, Kennedy's won't be making fun of me anymore or something to that effect.
[00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:43.653]  But anyway, I at that time did not absorb.
[00:45:43.653 --> 00:45:46.935]  I had a busy life going on at the time.
[00:45:46.935 --> 00:45:53.279]  But then I started meeting other people who were insiders to Johnson, and one by one,
[00:45:54.181 --> 00:45:57.926]  They tell me the same exact story.
[00:45:57.926 --> 00:46:01.071]  Lyndon Johnson was behind the assassination.
[00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:07.874]  Listen, his lawyer, as you know, has now gone public and talked about all his hitmen in Austin and the rest of it.
[00:46:07.874 --> 00:46:09.195]  It was well known.
[00:46:09.195 --> 00:46:12.517]  LBJ would just swagger around bragging about it, drunk half the time.
[00:46:12.517 --> 00:46:13.717]  He owns half the town still.
[00:46:13.717 --> 00:46:15.038]  His family does.
[00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:19.401]  I'm even on a local radio station he used to own, KLBJ 590.
[00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:22.063]  And he just basically did whatever he wanted to.
[00:46:22.063 --> 00:46:24.184]  And I even know folks, I'm not going to get into it.
[00:46:24.184 --> 00:46:28.087]  The point is, is that this is an open secret in Texas.
[00:46:28.087 --> 00:46:31.169]  They had signs up everywhere saying, you know, go after him for treason.
[00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:33.349]  And all the rest of it.
[00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:36.850]  And then they act like that, you know, we're weird for saying this.
[00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.531]  But I want to talk about the First Amendment.
[00:46:38.531 --> 00:46:44.833]  We'll also get into your book, sir, which everybody obviously should read to get a real insider breakdown on what happened.
[00:46:44.833 --> 00:46:48.954]  Because I've read your book and it's very historical from my deep research and is an excellent read.
[00:46:48.954 --> 00:46:57.016]  But expanding on this, if you just joined us, James Taig, the only other person shot other than JFK and Governor Connally 50 years ago this Friday in 1963 on November 22nd.
[00:46:59.537 --> 00:47:14.132]  What do you make, because it's in the Dallas newspapers, the fact that you've said you want to go, but no, a man who was there, a man who saw the President's head blown off from, I don't know, 15, 20 yards, whatever it was, and then was wounded by a bullet fragment,
[00:47:14.793 --> 00:47:17.555]  In the face, you don't get to go.
[00:47:17.555 --> 00:47:26.039]  And then the mayor says openly, well, we don't want this to be unseemly with any conspiracy theorists.
[00:47:26.039 --> 00:47:27.720]  We want this to be classy.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.082]  Yes, very classy to have the political
[00:47:31.075 --> 00:47:32.936]  Well, it's been six, seven weeks ago
[00:48:00.379 --> 00:48:25.134]  I was in a photo session with the mayor who was present, Mike Rollins, and I asked him about the way they're handling this 50th anniversary deal and he made it very clear that this was not about Kennedy being assassinated.
[00:48:25.134 --> 00:48:26.315]  This was about his life.
[00:48:26.315 --> 00:48:27.656]  They're going to celebrate his life.
[00:48:32.074 --> 00:48:34.796]  What about all those barricades and all this stuff?
[00:48:34.796 --> 00:48:37.459]  I've never known any problems there.
[00:48:37.459 --> 00:48:41.382]  Anybody who went to Dealey Plaza has never heard of a problem in 50 years.
[00:48:41.382 --> 00:48:44.425]  Why all this military-like thing?
[00:48:44.425 --> 00:48:47.408]  And he just shrugged his shoulders and walked off.
[00:48:49.684 --> 00:48:49.784]  Well...
[00:49:19.886 --> 00:49:20.706]  I'm surprised.
[00:49:20.706 --> 00:49:32.593]  I did get invited to the museum on Wednesday evening for a special deal, so I wasn't completely left out of it, but as far as being there,
[00:49:34.156 --> 00:49:35.837]  For the 50th anniversary?
[00:49:35.837 --> 00:49:36.998]  No, I'm not invited.
[00:49:52.646 --> 00:49:54.526]  Well, to back up a little bit, on the 40th anniversary
[00:50:21.361 --> 00:50:31.431]  Uh, they had Dealey Plaza blocked off, all three streets, and I was the guest speaker for the exact moment of the 40th anniversary.
[00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:40.460]  They had NBC, ABC, CBS, and all the other TV cameras there, and I was proud of that, and there was no problems whatsoever.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:45.425]  There was probably 10,000 people there in Dealey Plaza, but there was no problems.
[00:50:47.455 --> 00:50:47.816]  That's right.
[00:50:47.816 --> 00:50:48.336]  Well, stay there.
[00:50:48.336 --> 00:50:50.380]  I want to hear more about this historic figure.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.804]  James Tague is on the line with us.

[00:51:10.865 --> 00:51:17.249]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:51:17.649 --> 00:51:19.951]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:51:19.951 --> 00:51:21.292]  They're the good guys.

[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.321]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:36.936]  Well folks, we've got James Pegg on the line with us.
[00:54:37.998 --> 00:54:40.801]  And Jim is with us for this six-minute segment.
[00:54:40.801 --> 00:54:42.262]  The next five-minute segment, he's gonna be gone.
[00:54:42.262 --> 00:54:45.465]  And I've been asking some of the questions here.
[00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:49.449]  Sir, you know, after you leave, you'll probably remember something that you wanted to say and get out there.
[00:54:49.449 --> 00:54:51.230]  I know you're a Texas gentleman.
[00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:56.635]  Listening to you talk, you sound and pretty much look like my mother's father, my grandfather.
[00:54:56.635 --> 00:54:57.896]  I guess that'd be my paternal.
[00:54:58.817 --> 00:55:00.638]  Or no, maternal grandfather.
[00:55:00.638 --> 00:55:03.719]  So you just sound like a classic old-timey Texan.
[00:55:03.719 --> 00:55:06.980]  You know, you're a gentleman, you don't like to cause a ruckus, you want to be nice.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:08.961]  But, I mean, come on.
[00:55:08.961 --> 00:55:18.044]  They are openly saying that they're not going to let anybody in or near that doesn't agree with the official story when major polls show 90% or more.
[00:55:18.044 --> 00:55:19.964]  What is your take on the censorship issue?
[00:55:19.964 --> 00:55:22.845]  Because people can think whatever they want about JFK.
[00:55:22.845 --> 00:55:24.106]  If you research it, it's clear as...
[00:55:25.165 --> 00:55:28.787]  He knows on my face it's an inside job, a fraud that killed the Patsy.
[00:55:28.787 --> 00:55:32.389]  But what is your take on the First Amendment issue and then other points you'd like to make?
[00:55:32.389 --> 00:55:40.933]  Well, first of all, there's still people around that do not want the name of a president sullied.
[00:55:40.933 --> 00:55:42.534]  They just don't want him to come out.
[00:55:42.534 --> 00:55:48.397]  But here was a president that ordered at least eight or nine murders we know of.
[00:55:48.397 --> 00:55:51.659]  And those people say it was as many as 17.
[00:55:54.707 --> 00:56:00.030]  We know who the assassin is, Mike Wallace.
[00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:03.012]  His fingerprint was on the sixth floor.
[00:56:03.012 --> 00:56:04.793]  And it's all there.
[00:56:04.793 --> 00:56:16.400]  And I don't know why the pressure from the government is there to not allow the truth to come out.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.202]  But it's coming out, whether they like it or not.
[00:56:19.202 --> 00:56:23.284]  And there's three others who write the same thing almost in different ways.
[00:56:24.185 --> 00:56:28.329]  That's Roger Stone and Barr McClellan.
[00:56:28.329 --> 00:56:31.952]  Barr McClellan was the attorney.
[00:56:31.952 --> 00:56:37.637]  Name Johnson being behind the assassination.
[00:56:37.637 --> 00:56:39.359]  It's not a big deal to it.
[00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:44.103]  You just take it step by step and your proof has been laying there for years.
[00:56:45.708 --> 00:56:51.730]  Well, I've been around high-powered Republicans from Texas, and it's a big joke.
[00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:53.650]  I mean, it's well-known they blew his head off.
[00:56:53.650 --> 00:57:00.772]  And then they sit there and just criticize everyone that talks about it and call us conspiracy theorists.
[00:57:00.772 --> 00:57:06.654]  You'd have to be really a conspiracy theorist, a fiction writer, to come up with the official story.
[00:57:07.568 --> 00:57:09.468]  Well, there's no fiction to it.
[00:57:09.468 --> 00:57:11.529]  It's non-fiction story.
[00:57:11.529 --> 00:57:15.010]  The truth has been lying there in bits and pieces for years.
[00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:19.030]  I'm surprised somebody hadn't put it all together before me.
[00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:27.672]  One good example I'd like to make is, and I pointed out in the book, is the escape, the assassin's escape.
[00:57:27.672 --> 00:57:34.594]  And it's right, I own a 26-volume set of the Warren Report, and it's right in the Warren Report.
[00:57:34.594 --> 00:57:36.674]  Roy Truly's testimony, third time,
[00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:38.971]  Testifies.
[00:57:38.971 --> 00:57:43.314]  He tells how the assassins escaped.
[00:57:43.314 --> 00:57:44.035]  It's right there.
[00:57:44.035 --> 00:57:46.817]  Nobody's picked up on it for years.
[00:57:46.817 --> 00:57:47.497]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:48.858]  I want you to come back and talk about that.
[00:57:48.858 --> 00:57:59.386]  But specifically, what did you make of E. Howard Hunt, the famous CIA coup d'etat commander, doing a deathbed confession that he was part of the operation under LBJ?
[00:57:59.386 --> 00:58:03.509]  I did not put anything into that, and I got a reason for that.
[00:58:07.133 --> 00:58:11.294]  I would look at other books and scan them, but I never read other books.
[00:58:11.294 --> 00:58:18.916]  I don't think I want my head... I think I knew I was going to write this book someday, and I didn't want it influenced by others.
[00:58:18.916 --> 00:58:21.877]  You just went off with your own research and being part of it.
[00:58:21.877 --> 00:58:23.317]  That's right.
[00:58:23.317 --> 00:58:25.637]  And I guess folks can go to Amazon.com and get your book.
[00:58:25.637 --> 00:58:28.478]  Where else can they go?
[00:58:28.478 --> 00:58:33.439]  Barnes & Noble, go to my eBay bookstore.
[00:58:34.486 --> 00:58:35.586]  Alright, well folks need to read it.
[00:58:35.586 --> 00:58:36.427]  It's a good book.
[00:58:36.427 --> 00:58:36.827]  Stay there.
[00:58:36.827 --> 00:58:41.508]  Back in 60 seconds.
[00:58:41.508 --> 00:58:42.449]  Follow us on Twitter.
[00:58:42.449 --> 00:58:43.709]  Real Alex Jones.

[00:58:51.331 --> 00:58:56.812]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:58:56.812 --> 00:59:05.694]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:59:05.694 --> 00:59:13.515]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:59:13.515 --> 00:59:20.917]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:59:21.417 --> 00:59:25.380]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:29.584]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:59:29.584 --> 00:59:36.730]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.

[00:59:43.935 --> 00:59:47.979]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:59:53.775 --> 00:59:56.176]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.176 --> 01:00:05.499]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.499 --> 01:00:06.800]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.580]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.321]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.321 --> 01:00:11.921]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.921 --> 01:00:13.842]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.842 --> 01:00:17.643]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.643 --> 01:00:21.745]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:36.342]  James Teague, the only living person to be shot 50 years ago in Dealey Plaza, on record.
[01:00:36.342 --> 01:00:46.944]  Sir, there's so much to talk to you about, but you've got your new book out detailing this, and it dovetails with the hardcore research I've done, and also some of the insider intel I've gotten over the years.
[01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:52.686]  But we have the lawyer, of course the father of the White House Press Secretary, Scott McClellan, went public.
[01:00:52.686 --> 01:00:53.886]  We interviewed him then as well.
[01:00:56.499 --> 01:01:10.822]  The establishment does not want to be challenged on this, but separately, other points that you'd like to get across to folks out there for this 50th anniversary that's coming up?
[01:01:10.822 --> 01:01:17.323]  Well, the Warren Commission, let me explain something about the Warren Commission.
[01:01:17.323 --> 01:01:19.903]  They did not stand a chance.
[01:01:19.903 --> 01:01:24.624]  When Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president that very afternoon,
[01:01:25.785 --> 01:01:36.433]  Him and his buddy, who's handling the cover-up, J. Edgar Hoover, two of the most powerful men in the world, were in charge.
[01:01:36.433 --> 01:01:41.077]  If you figured it out or knew what happened, there was nobody to go tell it to.
[01:01:41.077 --> 01:01:43.338]  It was all over.
[01:01:43.338 --> 01:01:45.120]  L.B.J.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.702]  and Hoover were in charge.
[01:01:47.702 --> 01:01:48.963]  That was the end of it.
[01:01:48.963 --> 01:01:53.026]  Now, that was the circumstances that the Warren Commission worked.
[01:01:53.903 --> 01:02:08.833]  They wound up in the Warren Report, the final report, followed to a T what Hoover said 48 hours after the assassination that B.R.B.
[01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:12.795]  Oswald owned that assassin, blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:17.999]  And that's the reason we've got such a bad Warren Report.
[01:02:17.999 --> 01:02:19.520]  They just didn't have a chance.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.221]  Now, what a lot of people don't know,
[01:02:21.966 --> 01:02:26.109]  This is Jay Lee Rankin, who is Chief Counsel for the Warren Commission.
[01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:34.915]  He hired 14 young lawyers, most of them were young, to do the investigation.
[01:02:34.915 --> 01:02:39.398]  Now, the investigation didn't start until the end of March.
[01:02:39.398 --> 01:02:42.540]  They waited until the Ruby trial was over.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.922]  And they had set two months to do the total thing.
[01:02:45.922 --> 01:02:50.626]  To the contrary, what all this baloney about 10-month investigation.
[01:02:50.626 --> 01:02:51.066]  Two months.
[01:02:51.698 --> 01:02:56.959]  Sixty percent of the investigation was done in April of 64.
[01:02:56.959 --> 01:03:11.704]  And of these 14 lawyers, one by one, most of them figured out where the problem was and went to Rankin and says, hey, we need to look into this.
[01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:14.944]  This has got this to do with it.
[01:03:14.944 --> 01:03:18.325]  And Rankin would tell them, no, we're not going there.
[01:03:18.325 --> 01:03:19.486]  We're here to close it down.
[01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:22.872]  Go on with life.
[01:03:22.872 --> 01:03:28.496]  Well, in fact, they said the Commission was just there to basically whitewash things like the 9-11 Commission.
[01:03:28.496 --> 01:03:29.517]  What about the curb?
[01:03:29.517 --> 01:03:40.506]  Because I know there were some other curbs, not the one that ricocheted onto you where there were some bullet strike marks, but I'm told they cut away the curb and took it to the National Archives with the bullet that hit you or the fragment.
[01:03:40.506 --> 01:03:42.227]  Well, the curb, yeah.
[01:03:42.227 --> 01:03:45.330]  On August the 5th, I tried to testify to July 23rd of 64,
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:04:06.736]  They cut the curb out of the street on August 5, 1964 and sent it to the FBI laboratory where they did a test on it, which the test that they did then has now been found to be faulty junk science.
[01:04:06.736 --> 01:04:11.080]  But that curb is now sitting in the National Archives.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:29.525]  And in 1983, the Reader's Digest paid an engineering firm to go into the archives, examine the curb, and they found out that, yes, where the bullet had hit the curb has now been patched.
[01:04:29.525 --> 01:04:32.045]  Patched over.
[01:04:32.045 --> 01:04:37.287]  That curb was patched just before I testified.
[01:04:38.217 --> 01:04:40.318]  Wow, so just continual cover-up.
[01:04:40.318 --> 01:04:42.758]  I want to come back and ask you one final group of questions.
[01:04:42.758 --> 01:04:48.040]  We'll let you get out here in about five minutes, sir, and then we'll get to all the other news for the listeners and open the phones up.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:58.583]  I want to ask Mr. Teague, who's the only living survivor who was struck by any parts of the bullets, I want to ask him if he ever thinks the truth will officially come out straight ahead.
[01:05:00.751 --> 01:05:06.559]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:13.948]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:05:13.948 --> 01:05:17.312]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:05:17.312 --> 01:05:19.075]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:23.979]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:05:23.979 --> 01:05:26.902]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:32.847]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:05:32.847 --> 01:05:36.531]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:05:36.531 --> 01:05:41.775]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[01:05:44.998 --> 01:05:50.987]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[01:07:01.155 --> 01:07:02.215]  I had tried everything.
[01:07:02.215 --> 01:07:04.576]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:07:04.576 --> 01:07:07.697]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:07:07.697 --> 01:07:12.539]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:07:12.539 --> 01:07:19.382]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:07:19.382 --> 01:07:29.846]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:07:30.606 --> 01:07:35.067]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:41.328]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:07:41.328 --> 01:07:42.908]  Now that's results.
[01:07:42.908 --> 01:07:49.689]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.

[01:08:10.506 --> 01:08:12.088]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.630]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:17.835]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.835 --> 01:08:21.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.422 --> 01:08:26.383]  Well, the rest of the country is in a depression, but D.C.
[01:08:26.383 --> 01:08:33.286]  is now the fastest growing region of one percenters in the United States, overtaking New York and L.A.
[01:08:33.286 --> 01:08:35.287]  Income gap widens.
[01:08:35.287 --> 01:08:41.890]  If you're not part of the insider operation, if you're not part of the globalist operation, well, then you're gonna go bankrupt.
[01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:43.591]  They pick the winners and the losers.
[01:08:43.591 --> 01:08:46.232]  Israel working with Saudis on Iran's strike plan.
[01:08:46.232 --> 01:08:48.253]  We're gonna get to that after our guest leaves us.
[01:08:48.253 --> 01:08:50.414]  Netanyahu jabs Obama.
[01:08:50.414 --> 01:08:52.595]  Closest advisor issues a warning.
[01:08:54.383 --> 01:08:55.924]  That is just some of what's coming up.
[01:08:55.924 --> 01:08:58.447]  The news up on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:58.447 --> 01:09:04.011]  Actor Lennox responds to claims he trained Obama.
[01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:07.514]  And Mancow releases the photo of him in studio with him.
[01:09:07.514 --> 01:09:11.458]  So that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:11.458 --> 01:09:17.023]  We've also got TSA rolls out detention pods at airport terminal exits.
[01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:21.031]  We're going to be getting into that.
[01:09:21.031 --> 01:09:26.375]  NBC confronts Pelosi with pass it to see what's in it clip.
[01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:28.977]  We're going to be getting into that report as well.
[01:09:31.721 --> 01:09:37.105]  Law enforcement comes out with ankle bracelets that have built-in phone to transmit audio.
[01:09:37.105 --> 01:09:37.426]  Why not?
[01:09:37.426 --> 01:09:39.888]  Everybody else has their cameras listening to them and their cell phones.
[01:09:39.888 --> 01:09:42.350]  This is total Orwellville.
[01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:46.133]  So that's just a sum of the news coming up.
[01:09:46.133 --> 01:09:51.597]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:51.597 --> 01:09:54.380]  We're also going to be getting into
[01:09:55.788 --> 01:09:59.069]  Some of the other latest developments on Obamacare.
[01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:02.770]  But we're joined right now by James Taig.
[01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:08.111]  Three people were shot 50 years ago this Friday in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas.
[01:10:08.111 --> 01:10:10.972]  One of them, of course, was John F. Kennedy, who died.
[01:10:10.972 --> 01:10:14.172]  Governor Connolly, who was seriously grievously wounded but survived.
[01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:17.673]  The Governor of Texas and James Taig, Jim Taig.
[01:10:17.673 --> 01:10:24.815]  And what I was talking to in the last 30 minutes, if you just joined us, he's got a book out breaking down what really happened just from the eyewitness reports.
[01:10:26.625 --> 01:10:27.886]  LBJ's lawyer.
[01:10:27.886 --> 01:10:30.267]  LBJ openly bragged to him about killing him.
[01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:32.168]  And people say, you're whitewashing.
[01:10:32.168 --> 01:10:33.609]  It goes above LBJ.
[01:10:33.609 --> 01:10:35.690]  Of course it goes above LBJ.
[01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:38.972]  That's as high as we can get.
[01:10:38.972 --> 01:10:49.238]  But the issue is, they're now banning anybody that doesn't agree with the official lie, including Mr. Tague, who's been the keynote speaker a decade ago at the 40th anniversary.
[01:10:49.238 --> 01:10:51.119]  There's never been such censorship going on.
[01:10:51.119 --> 01:10:53.841]  They're keeping everybody many blocks away.
[01:10:53.841 --> 01:10:55.162]  And even someone wounded there.
[01:10:56.089 --> 01:11:02.631]  He's famously part of this, and was just, I don't know, how many yards away from Kennedy when his head blew off, or blew open.
[01:11:02.631 --> 01:11:03.891]  Not allowed to be there.
[01:11:03.891 --> 01:11:07.472]  Why do you think, sir, they want to control this so much more, A?
[01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:11.814]  And B, do you ever think the truth will come out in the mainstream media?
[01:11:12.654 --> 01:11:15.716]  It was supposed to come out after 20 years, then 40 years, then 50.
[01:11:15.716 --> 01:11:17.737]  Now they've backed it to, what is it, 2025.
[01:11:17.737 --> 01:11:26.783]  I mean, I guess we can never learn what's in those archives, because I guess it would discredit all the conspiracy theorists, a.k.a.
[01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:29.384]  anyone that questions known liars.
[01:11:29.384 --> 01:11:33.587]  Well, first of all, the truth is out there if people are ready to accept it.
[01:11:33.587 --> 01:11:38.890]  Now, one thing while I was waiting, thinking about in my book,
[01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:54.415]  Uh, just as I was about to finish my book, I was in Dealey Plaza doing an interview for somebody, and a man walks up to me and says, uh, you James Jager, he says, here, you might want to put this in your book, and he handed me a folder.
[01:11:54.415 --> 01:12:05.139]  When I got home, I opened it up, and it was a copy of a KGB report on Lyndon Johnson that they'd made, uh, in 1964.
[01:12:09.417 --> 01:12:11.718]  We're good to go.
[01:12:39.932 --> 01:12:44.374]  This they had in 1965.
[01:12:44.374 --> 01:12:50.637]  Two years after the assassination, they had it step-by-step and solved it.
[01:12:50.637 --> 01:12:54.279]  Here, 50 years later, our government officially hasn't.
[01:12:54.279 --> 01:13:08.626]  I included this night in my book for people to compare, and it takes it step-by-step just like I do, and Roger Stone, and Laura McLintock, and anybody else that solved the
[01:13:21.154 --> 01:13:25.697]  Well, I agree with you that the truth is out there if people want to face the facts.
[01:13:25.697 --> 01:13:27.138]  And really, we've won.
[01:13:27.138 --> 01:13:36.345]  I mean, if most polls show 90% or more don't believe the official story, and the Secretary of State goes public saying he doesn't buy it,
[01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:40.751]  Well, that's their problem.
[01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:46.872]  I'm not going to let it be my problem.
[01:13:46.872 --> 01:13:50.572]  I'm 77 years old now.
[01:13:50.572 --> 01:13:53.533]  I put in my book what I know, the facts.
[01:13:53.533 --> 01:13:57.294]  I didn't let anything influence me that somebody else has written.
[01:13:57.294 --> 01:14:04.635]  Just what I know from talking to people face-to-face and that I know personally.
[01:14:05.953 --> 01:14:13.199]  And I don't think any other author could compare that to what I do know.
[01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.300]  I know this.
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:20.465]  The folks up in Dallas that are running things, who are trying to cover up what really happened, they've already failed.
[01:14:20.465 --> 01:14:27.911]  And the fact that they're censoring anyone that doesn't agree with their fairy tale is only going to politically backfire on them.
[01:14:28.609 --> 01:14:30.469]  Well, I'm not going to let it happen to me.
[01:14:30.469 --> 01:14:36.151]  I know one of the main facts that needs to be made public.
[01:14:36.151 --> 01:14:40.292]  Oswald was not the shooter.
[01:14:40.292 --> 01:14:48.594]  We've known for 50 years that one of the girls saw him in the lunchroom 15 minutes before the assassination.
[01:14:48.594 --> 01:14:55.656]  Roy Truly and Marion Baker, the policemen, saw him 75 seconds after the assassination in the lunchroom.
[01:14:56.557 --> 01:14:58.899]  Uh, Carl Kuhleck, that was her testimony.
[01:14:58.899 --> 01:15:00.220]  It wasn't out of breath.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:03.002]  Now, we've known that for 50 years.
[01:15:03.002 --> 01:15:14.752]  So I saw him in the lunchroom 15 minutes before the assassination, in the building manager and replacement saw him 75 seconds after the assassination in the lunchroom.
[01:15:14.752 --> 01:15:19.496]  Now, we also now know by interviews of who was on the stairway.
[01:15:22.717 --> 01:15:24.157]  But then it gets more ridiculous.
[01:15:24.157 --> 01:15:28.839]  You can't shoot through the oak trees that are out there that had their leaves.
[01:15:28.839 --> 01:15:32.701]  They dropped their leaves not in the winter, folks, but in another part of the year.
[01:15:32.701 --> 01:15:33.881]  We have those here in Texas.
[01:15:33.881 --> 01:15:34.802]  I mean, it's asinine.
[01:15:34.802 --> 01:15:35.942]  I've seen the photos.
[01:15:35.942 --> 01:15:39.383]  You could not shoot him, period, the way they said.
[01:15:39.383 --> 01:15:43.405]  The obvious shot is from behind the grassy knoll, which is what all the witnesses saw.
[01:15:44.245 --> 01:15:51.248]  And witnesses saw the men up there with the pickup truck and the guns, and then of course those witnesses all conveniently died very quickly.
[01:15:51.248 --> 01:15:57.710]  Well, first of all, one of the big lies was finding three shells on the floor of the sniper's nest.
[01:15:57.710 --> 01:16:00.891]  There was only two shells found.
[01:16:00.891 --> 01:16:07.834]  So that meant a third person shooting from somewhere else in School Book Depository.
[01:16:07.834 --> 01:16:10.855]  And the fact that Lieutenant Day
[01:16:11.494 --> 01:16:15.699]  Well sure, look at how the Dallas Police walked Oswald out to be executed.
[01:16:15.699 --> 01:16:19.883]  He was saying, I'm a patsy, don't let them kill me.
[01:16:19.883 --> 01:16:22.105]  I mean, this is incredibly obvious.
[01:16:34.665 --> 01:16:38.428]  The Jack Ruby Oswald story is a completely different story.
[01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:41.030]  I don't want to... I touch on that in my book.
[01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.432]  I don't get deep into it.
[01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:47.054]  That's a course I don't go.
[01:16:47.054 --> 01:16:50.737]  Oswald, first of all, flat innocent of being shot.
[01:16:50.737 --> 01:16:54.019]  That does not mean he didn't have something to do with something.
[01:16:54.019 --> 01:16:57.102]  But Oswald was not the shooter.
[01:16:57.102 --> 01:16:58.983]  Malcolm Wallace.
[01:16:58.983 --> 01:17:02.206]  Mike Wallace was the assassin.
[01:17:02.206 --> 01:17:03.907]  His fingerprint was found up there.
[01:17:04.734 --> 01:17:06.635]  I'm going to try to stay at home.
[01:17:06.635 --> 01:17:11.558]  And I got so many invitations for this, that, the other.
[01:17:11.558 --> 01:17:12.078]  I don't know.
[01:17:12.078 --> 01:17:12.999]  I might change my mind.
[01:17:30.816 --> 01:17:32.598]  Well, listen, we're going to get your number.
[01:17:32.598 --> 01:17:34.120]  We'll give you our cell phone number.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.543]  John, give them your cell phone, one of my producers.
[01:17:36.543 --> 01:17:38.926]  If you do come down, let us know.
[01:17:38.926 --> 01:17:43.972]  And we'd like to interview you for 10, 15 minutes on video camera down there.
[01:17:43.972 --> 01:17:45.574]  So if you are coming, we'd like to talk to you.
[01:17:48.268 --> 01:17:50.709]  And thank you so much, Mr. Tagg.
[01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:56.312]  Your book, again, for folks that just joined us, is available.
[01:17:56.312 --> 01:17:58.433]  And I hope that people will get a copy of it.
[01:17:58.433 --> 01:18:02.876]  It's LBJ and the Kennedy Killing by eyewitness James T. Tagg.
[01:18:02.876 --> 01:18:04.136]  Thank you very much, Mr. Tagg.
[01:18:04.136 --> 01:18:05.057]  Thank you.
[01:18:05.057 --> 01:18:06.618]  All right, talk to him, John, see if he wants to meet us.
[01:18:07.698 --> 01:18:15.306]  Wow, this is going to be a lot of live coverage during the radio show, the nightly news, and then we're going to have live feeds Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[01:18:15.306 --> 01:18:19.850]  We're going to have John Bowne reporting with others starting Tuesday.
[01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:22.112]  So I guess they're leaving tomorrow.
[01:18:22.112 --> 01:18:24.755]  They're going to be down there reporting for us with live reports.
[01:18:24.755 --> 01:18:27.558]  I'm going to be there Wednesday night, Thursday, Friday, and then Saturday.
[01:18:28.058 --> 01:18:31.681]  Because they are just continuing trying to prop up their facade.
[01:18:31.681 --> 01:18:39.106]  Briefly, the reason we have Dr. Busley, physicist, joining us is they have new Journal of Pediatrics report out.
[01:18:40.882 --> 01:19:04.704]  In confirmed cases of congenital hyperthyroidism in California as a function of environmental fallout from Fukushima nuclear meltdown, and Dr. Busby says this is a big deal, and we have other concerns over multiple illnesses forcing Malibu High classroom shutdown, three teachers getting cancer, and the SEALs are dying not just in California but up in
[01:19:05.425 --> 01:19:08.926]  Alaska, people's hairs falling out, this is pretty crazy stuff.
[01:19:08.926 --> 01:19:15.509]  And folks, that's why we have this product, Nacin Iodine Survival Shield, and we fund our operation partly with it.
[01:19:15.509 --> 01:19:17.430]  It's a win-win situation for what we believe in.
[01:19:19.034 --> 01:19:27.817]  I found out about this and said no one knows about this and began taking it because I wanted to maximum try to protect my thyroid and my family's thyroid.
[01:19:27.817 --> 01:19:30.378]  And this is what I decided to do.
[01:19:30.378 --> 01:19:31.959]  This is the choice I decided to use.
[01:19:31.959 --> 01:19:38.701]  This is proprietary, nascent, unbound, pure, nascent iodine available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:38.701 --> 01:19:39.761]  We have more of it in.
[01:19:39.761 --> 01:19:41.822]  You've heard the rave reviews from listeners.
[01:19:41.822 --> 01:19:43.963]  And with all this going on, it's not a silver bullet.
[01:19:44.443 --> 01:19:47.328]  But it's as close as you're going to get to that without moving to the Southern Hemisphere.

[01:19:56.401 --> 01:19:58.585]  It also detoxifies the fluoride.
[01:20:00.933 --> 01:20:04.734]  Hi, this is Gary Cooper with Midas Resources Gold and Silver.
[01:20:04.734 --> 01:20:09.035]  Government shutdown, inept politicians, entitlements looming Obamacare.
[01:20:09.035 --> 01:20:10.036]  The death of the U.S.
[01:20:10.036 --> 01:20:13.637]  dollar as a global reserve currency is what nobody wants to acknowledge.
[01:20:13.637 --> 01:20:17.198]  We have a debt bubble that cannot be paid and will eventually crash the dollar.
[01:20:17.198 --> 01:20:21.459]  If you're concerned about keeping your money, why not consider storing your wealth in gold and silver?
[01:20:21.459 --> 01:20:23.360]  Call me, Gary Cooper, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 130.
[01:20:27.901 --> 01:20:30.743]  Together we'll discuss your options of buying gold and silver.
[01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:34.466]  Again, the global elite have plans for your money and it doesn't include you.
[01:20:34.466 --> 01:20:36.788]  So call me, Gary Cooper, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 130.
[01:20:36.788 --> 01:20:39.970]  And we'll discuss your options of buying precious metals.
[01:20:43.513 --> 01:20:49.399]  Also, I can send you information on how you can roll over your IRA or 401k into a precious metal IRA.
[01:20:49.399 --> 01:20:53.123]  Again, don't get caught with money in your account when the dollar crashes.
[01:20:53.123 --> 01:20:54.825]  Call me, Gary Cooper, at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.825 --> 01:20:55.086]  Extend to 130.
[01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:14.438]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[01:21:14.438 --> 01:21:24.745]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless Pure Nano Silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.
[01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:30.048]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[01:21:30.048 --> 01:21:40.016]  For many who are new to silver, that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays.
[01:21:40.356 --> 01:21:41.097]  We're good to go.
[01:21:59.755 --> 01:22:10.439]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:22:10.439 --> 01:22:12.500]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.381]  Fluoride!
[01:22:13.381 --> 01:22:15.301]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:22:15.301 --> 01:22:21.604]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:22:21.864 --> 01:22:26.788]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:22:26.788 --> 01:22:33.113]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:22:33.113 --> 01:22:35.535]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:22:35.535 --> 01:22:38.477]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:22:38.477 --> 01:22:41.860]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:47.403]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:22:47.403 --> 01:22:52.506]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:22:52.506 --> 01:22:53.687]  I take it every day.
[01:22:53.687 --> 01:22:56.608]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.721]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?
[01:23:03.721 --> 01:23:05.282]  Big Berkey Water Filters!
[01:23:05.282 --> 01:23:07.222]  Yes, the gift of clean water.
[01:23:07.222 --> 01:23:11.904]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:15.505]  A Big Berkey Water Filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[01:23:15.805 --> 01:23:19.568]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[01:23:19.568 --> 01:23:25.133]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:29.196]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[01:23:29.196 --> 01:23:34.240]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:41.304]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.
[01:23:41.304 --> 01:23:49.068]  Order online at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com, spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y, waterfilters.com.
[01:23:49.068 --> 01:23:51.949]  Or call 877-99-BERKEY.
[01:23:51.949 --> 01:23:55.891]  That's 877-99-BER-K-E-Y.
[01:23:55.891 --> 01:23:57.292]  Gift well this Christmas.
[01:23:57.292 --> 01:23:58.733]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!
[01:24:33.769 --> 01:24:35.589]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[01:24:35.589 --> 01:24:39.410]  I want to get into this subject, just because it's interesting and informative.
[01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:43.471]  We know Obama is basically a CIA creation.
[01:24:43.471 --> 01:24:55.253]  We know that Obama's mother, his father, his grandfather, all of them, the multiple fathers, the multiple names, the sealed records, we don't know who he really is.
[01:24:55.253 --> 01:24:59.114]  He is an actor that reads off teleprompters, that's undoubted.
[01:24:59.114 --> 01:25:03.255]  Multiple different names, Barry Sotero, the list goes on and on.
[01:25:05.134 --> 01:25:10.477]  Grandfather in the CIA, grandmother, top foundations, working for the Geithner family.
[01:25:10.477 --> 01:25:13.419]  Very special person, chosen for his mission.
[01:25:13.419 --> 01:25:16.661]  And then actor Lennox, Harry Lennox.
[01:25:17.935 --> 01:25:20.776]  Goes on Mankow's show last week, and I've known Mankow like 10 years.
[01:25:20.776 --> 01:25:22.897]  I know when he's joking around, when he's being serious.
[01:25:22.897 --> 01:25:24.198]  He's totally serious.
[01:25:24.198 --> 01:25:29.060]  Lennox, when he's leaving, goes, listen, don't think because I'm black, that's the full conversation, that I like Obama.
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:31.982]  He is a rat bastard, traitor.
[01:25:31.982 --> 01:25:36.004]  I basically taught him everything he knows, practically lived with him, on and on and on.
[01:25:36.004 --> 01:25:42.967]  Well, Lennox got questioned after he gave a speech by a citizen blogger, and he confirmed that I don't like Obama.
[01:25:42.967 --> 01:25:46.349]  It's confirmed he won't play Obama, because that would be Lennox
[01:25:47.864 --> 01:25:50.546]  Playing someone that plays Linux, basically.
[01:25:50.546 --> 01:25:54.090]  And if you listen to Linux talk and the way he acts, it's Obama.
[01:25:54.090 --> 01:25:55.631]  And so there is a major history there.
[01:25:55.631 --> 01:25:56.632]  He doesn't deny that.
[01:25:56.632 --> 01:26:00.415]  He says, though, those are not my words in the interview.
[01:26:00.415 --> 01:26:01.757]  So he's distancing himself.
[01:26:01.757 --> 01:26:04.419]  He looks scared when it got brought up.
[01:26:04.419 --> 01:26:08.283]  If somebody brought something up that wasn't true, you wouldn't look scared and freaked out.
[01:26:08.743 --> 01:26:10.405]  He looks seriously concerned.
[01:26:10.405 --> 01:26:18.093]  We're not trying to get Lennox in trouble or anything, because if you talk about Lord Obama, you'll never work in Hollywood again, as James Woods and others have said.
[01:26:19.281 --> 01:26:21.142]  We appreciate his courage.
[01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:25.623]  It's on record, hundreds of photos of him going back decades to the late 90s.
[01:26:25.623 --> 01:26:31.705]  So we're talking 15, 16 years or longer with Obama at Obama's house, him in Obama's house.
[01:26:31.705 --> 01:26:36.366]  He said they lived by each other and practically lived together, but he tried to back off of that.
[01:26:36.366 --> 01:26:42.088]  But if you watch the video that's up on InfoWars.com, he looks pretty freaked out and confirms quite a bit of it.
[01:26:42.968 --> 01:26:54.631]  And ManCal this morning, because of this, sent a photo of he and Lennox in studio, plus there's video on local Fox TV, they simulcast his show three hours in the morning, of Lennox on the show.
[01:26:54.631 --> 01:27:07.634]  So Lennox went on the show, was on local TV syndicating his syndicated radio show, and there is a photo of them right before ManCal walked Lennox out at the end of the segment to the parking lot.
[01:27:08.234 --> 01:27:09.295]  So, there it is.
[01:27:09.295 --> 01:27:10.756]  There's Mancow and Lennox.
[01:27:10.756 --> 01:27:15.238]  Last week, just as Mancow said, let's go to the video and the audio.
[01:27:15.238 --> 01:27:16.439]  The Citizen Journal was shot.
[01:27:16.439 --> 01:27:16.759]  Here it is.
[01:27:32.955 --> 01:27:35.178]  Did you see that interview online?
[01:27:35.178 --> 01:27:36.879]  It was fake.
[01:27:36.879 --> 01:27:38.922]  I like the blacklist, by the way.
[01:27:38.922 --> 01:27:42.406]  But was that interview bullshit, or what was that all about?
[01:27:42.406 --> 01:27:43.627]  That's hearsay.
[01:27:43.627 --> 01:27:45.249]  Somebody's saying something, and somebody else.
[01:27:45.249 --> 01:27:47.251]  Those were not my words.
[01:27:47.251 --> 01:27:49.814]  Did Obama train you to be like that, or is that not true?
[01:27:50.334 --> 01:27:51.875]  You don't have to ask me.
[01:27:51.875 --> 01:27:52.816]  You saw him.
[01:27:52.816 --> 01:27:55.278]  You guys have such similar mannerisms.
[01:27:55.278 --> 01:27:58.981]  Yeah, well, I knew him a long time ago.
[01:27:58.981 --> 01:28:02.043]  So Obama didn't literally train to be like you.
[01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:04.605]  I didn't know anyone like you.
[01:28:04.605 --> 01:28:07.047]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:28:07.047 --> 01:28:07.888]  He saw it.
[01:28:07.888 --> 01:28:09.770]  Yeah, I knew him.
[01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:11.351]  I'm sorry to obsess over this question.
[01:28:13.442 --> 01:28:15.383]  It was just such a mind-blowing interview.
[01:28:15.383 --> 01:28:19.566]  The guy said... The world doesn't work like that, in my opinion.
[01:28:19.566 --> 01:28:21.267]  Are you a reporter or something?
[01:28:21.267 --> 01:28:23.649]  I'm an independent journalist kind of guy.
[01:28:23.649 --> 01:28:25.210]  I never said those words.
[01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:30.373]  I don't like Barack Obama.
[01:28:30.373 --> 01:28:32.014]  Or his policies.
[01:28:32.014 --> 01:28:35.517]  But I never said that I trained him or anything like that.
[01:28:35.517 --> 01:28:38.219]  So Alex Jones and that guy Mancat, were they making that up?
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.001]  People hear what they want.
[01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:41.441]  I have no idea.
[01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:42.862]  I didn't hear the interview.
[01:28:42.862 --> 01:28:44.343]  I heard about the interview.
[01:28:44.343 --> 01:28:48.767]  It's been on a lot of news on YouTube and this and that.
[01:28:48.767 --> 01:28:50.308]  But I'm a fan of The Blacklist.
[01:28:50.308 --> 01:28:52.790]  It's a pretty cool show.
[01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:53.490]  You lived with him.
[01:28:53.490 --> 01:28:55.352]  Is he a trustworthy individual?
[01:28:55.352 --> 01:28:56.333]  I didn't live with him.
[01:28:56.333 --> 01:28:57.594]  You didn't live with him?
[01:28:57.594 --> 01:28:57.994]  No.
[01:28:57.994 --> 01:28:59.575]  But you don't like his policies?
[01:28:59.575 --> 01:28:59.975]  I do not.
[01:29:01.696 --> 01:29:09.479]  Is the main narrative of Barack Obama true, or have we been fed a big thing of lies?
[01:29:09.479 --> 01:29:12.120]  I don't know what that main narrative is.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.860]  His books, he went to college, you know, just the main narrative.
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:16.481]  I never read his books.
[01:29:16.481 --> 01:29:18.522]  But he's not a trustworthy individual.
[01:29:18.522 --> 01:29:19.242]  I didn't say that.
[01:29:19.242 --> 01:29:20.742]  All I said is I don't like his policies.
[01:29:20.742 --> 01:29:21.062]  Okay.
[01:29:21.062 --> 01:29:21.883]  Thank you.
[01:29:23.908 --> 01:29:27.111]  By the way, Mills Most is the journalist that went out and did it.
[01:29:27.111 --> 01:29:28.792]  You can see his YouTube channel.
[01:29:28.792 --> 01:29:31.074]  One of his videos has 2 million views.
[01:29:31.074 --> 01:29:34.237]  But Mills Most is the fellow that got that.
[01:29:34.237 --> 01:29:34.777]  Good job.
[01:29:34.777 --> 01:29:36.839]  I'd like to interview Mills Most.
[01:29:36.839 --> 01:29:40.282]  But you noticed that he didn't deny he doesn't like Obama.
[01:29:40.282 --> 01:29:41.383]  And look, look.
[01:29:41.383 --> 01:29:44.626]  Mancow's telling the truth.
[01:29:44.626 --> 01:29:47.308]  And obviously the actor Lennox is concerned.
[01:29:50.319 --> 01:29:54.266]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.266 --> 01:29:56.931]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.522 --> 01:30:08.146]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:30:08.146 --> 01:30:10.568]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:30:10.568 --> 01:30:10.988]  The U.S.
[01:30:10.988 --> 01:30:15.211]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:30:15.211 --> 01:30:18.193]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:30:18.193 --> 01:30:19.674]  They want that attack to come.
[01:30:19.674 --> 01:30:25.898]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:30:26.243 --> 01:30:28.906]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:30:28.906 --> 01:30:33.891]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:30:33.891 --> 01:30:41.319]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:30:41.619 --> 01:30:44.382]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:30:44.382 --> 01:30:47.504]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:30:47.504 --> 01:30:52.048]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[01:30:52.048 --> 01:30:56.632]  Available only at InfoWarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:11.518]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:31:11.518 --> 01:31:13.580]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:14.460]  Fluoride.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.381]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:16.381 --> 01:31:22.966]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:31:22.966 --> 01:31:27.889]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:31:27.889 --> 01:31:29.590]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ
[01:31:30.851 --> 01:31:31.432]  We're good.
[01:32:00.812 --> 01:32:03.814]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:32:03.814 --> 01:32:08.837]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:08.837 --> 01:32:16.021]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:32:16.141 --> 01:32:21.785]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:32:21.785 --> 01:32:25.808]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:32:25.808 --> 01:32:30.532]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:32:30.532 --> 01:32:35.756]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:32:35.996 --> 01:32:39.219]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:32:39.219 --> 01:32:41.741]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:32:41.741 --> 01:32:46.504]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:32:46.504 --> 01:32:49.386]  Hand crank shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:32:49.386 --> 01:32:56.592]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:32:56.592 --> 01:32:57.873]  We're getting prepared.
[01:32:57.873 --> 01:32:58.533]  Are you?
[01:32:58.533 --> 01:32:59.314]  Infowarshop.com
[01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:23.138]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:23.138 --> 01:33:27.845]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:43.857 --> 01:33:48.781]  Ladies and gentlemen, the toll free number to join us on any news item you want to discuss.
[01:33:48.781 --> 01:33:55.807]  Not allowing any free speech anywhere within a half mile of Dealey Plaza coming up on the 5th anniversary.
[01:33:55.807 --> 01:34:01.352]  The nightmare that is Obamacare, the tornadoes and the response to that.
[01:34:01.352 --> 01:34:03.954]  The TSA ordering because they're all powerful.
[01:34:03.954 --> 01:34:06.056]  Prison doors when you try to leave the...
[01:34:08.996 --> 01:34:20.893]  Airport, just like Italian banks have had for a decade, you have to get authorization to go in and you have to get authorization to go out so they can lock everything down and so your family can be separated from you.
[01:34:20.893 --> 01:34:25.279]  I mean, this country is being turned into a prison with our tax dollars.
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:30.704]  That is really, really important information.
[01:34:30.704 --> 01:34:32.546]  Coming up, again the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:34:32.546 --> 01:34:32.606]  800-259-9231.
[01:34:32.606 --> 01:34:33.487]  Coming up, let me grab it.
[01:34:42.449 --> 01:34:44.010]  It's over here in this stack right here.
[01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:46.111]  Let me show TV viewers this.
[01:34:46.111 --> 01:34:48.333]  Now again, folks, what do I do?
[01:34:48.333 --> 01:34:52.796]  I promote and push and sell what I believe in, what I use.
[01:34:52.796 --> 01:34:59.300]  I know they're putting glyphosates in the water, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium fluoride, lead, mercury, arsenic, you name it.
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:05.965]  The number one thing I can do for my family, for my family, is not
[01:35:07.577 --> 01:35:10.219]  Drink all the poison that's in the water table.
[01:35:10.219 --> 01:35:12.361]  By accident and on purpose.
[01:35:12.361 --> 01:35:17.005]  That's why I promote ProPure water filtration systems at the lowest price.
[01:35:17.005 --> 01:35:19.728]  Super high quality, stainless steel, gravity fed.
[01:35:19.728 --> 01:35:22.230]  Annihilates the competition.
[01:35:22.230 --> 01:35:24.432]  20% off with promo code WATER20.
[01:35:26.115 --> 01:35:36.057]  Water 20, you get 20% off on the entire ProPure, Pro1 family, all of their different products at InfowarStore.com.
[01:35:36.057 --> 01:35:41.418]  And it's your purchase of these fine products that makes the broadcast possible and the whole team that we have here.
[01:35:41.418 --> 01:35:44.099]  And I've had times, folks, where I lose money for a year.
[01:35:44.099 --> 01:35:45.779]  I've had times where I make money.
[01:35:45.779 --> 01:35:53.821]  And I've made the decision to try to really capitalize the information we have to really build up our capital.
[01:35:55.307 --> 01:35:57.175]  I've had the decision to build up our capital.
[01:35:58.351 --> 01:36:05.416]  So that we can then build our media operation and our organization and have a bigger effect.
[01:36:05.416 --> 01:36:18.365]  So when you buy the ProPure water filtration system, you're not only getting a great filtration system at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere, you're supporting the tip of the spear in the info war and you're helping capitalize our operation.
[01:36:18.365 --> 01:36:21.207]  You're literally buying war bonds in the info war.
[01:36:21.207 --> 01:36:23.569]  You can also call toll free 888-253-3139 and ask any questions.
[01:36:27.992 --> 01:36:38.357]  About any other products or any specifics, and give them the promo code WATER20 to get 20% off 888-253-3139 or InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:38.357 --> 01:36:40.478]  And again, thank you all for your support.
[01:36:40.478 --> 01:36:42.099]  Couldn't do it without you.
[01:36:42.099 --> 01:36:57.487]  You can also be a subscriber to InfoWars Nightly News to see all of my films, to see the nightly news, to see the higher quality commercial-free podcast video and audio, and so many other films and special live events and everything.
[01:36:58.147 --> 01:37:01.009]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:37:01.009 --> 01:37:02.230]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:37:02.230 --> 01:37:06.514]  I want to salute all the members of PrisonPlanet.TV and thank you for your support.
[01:37:06.514 --> 01:37:16.001]  But if you're watching us out there later on YouTube and other platforms by the hundreds of millions a year, you really should become a subscriber at PrisonPlanet.TV to support the operation.
[01:37:16.001 --> 01:37:21.865]  But so we can also have a platform that Google or YouTube can't just shut down.
[01:37:21.865 --> 01:37:26.028]  The reason I have InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net,
[01:37:27.793 --> 01:37:29.354]  Propagandamatrix.com.
[01:37:29.354 --> 01:37:31.296]  It's really Paul Watson's website.
[01:37:31.296 --> 01:37:33.238]  We work with StoryLeak.com.
[01:37:33.238 --> 01:37:42.847]  We work with other sites so they can't just shut me down and can't just shut us up because we've been hacked, we've been attacked, we've been shut down, we've been censored.
[01:37:42.847 --> 01:37:44.108]  All sorts of stuff's happened.
[01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:48.292]  So I learned to not put all of our media operations in one basket.
[01:37:48.292 --> 01:37:49.953]  That's why I've started InfoWarsNightlyNews.
[01:37:50.814 --> 01:37:53.996]  And tried to develop a group of reporters and people that understand what's happening.
[01:37:53.996 --> 01:38:04.121]  And I've actually found smart, dedicated, good people who care about freedom and liberty, and who are excited about journalism, real journalism, in many cases that do a better job than I can.
[01:38:04.121 --> 01:38:06.542]  Because I'm not in competition with other media people.
[01:38:06.542 --> 01:38:14.827]  I want to build a future to resist folks, so if I get put in prison for some set-up reason, or I get my head blown off, or I die in a car wreck,
[01:38:15.652 --> 01:38:20.374]  Or struck by a bolt of lightning, I intend for InfoWars to continue on.
[01:38:20.374 --> 01:38:25.477]  I haven't quite gotten to that level yet where I think it would safely do that, but we're getting close.
[01:38:25.477 --> 01:38:30.279]  This is a serious situation, ladies and gentlemen, and it's for all the marbles.
[01:38:30.279 --> 01:38:37.343]  I want my children to grow up in a free society, not an enslaved society, and no one can doubt we're going into one.
[01:38:37.343 --> 01:38:38.904]  Separately, look at these articles.
[01:38:40.894 --> 01:38:42.715]  Dr. Busby is on about this.
[01:38:42.715 --> 01:38:47.697]  I wanted to get Dr. Busby on about removing the fuel rods, the danger of that.
[01:38:47.697 --> 01:38:53.660]  Most scientists and engineers have said they'll probably will ignite some fuel rods when they're doing it because there's tens of thousands of them.
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:56.402]  There'll be a huge explosion if there is.
[01:38:56.402 --> 01:38:59.823]  The whole area is sinking because they've got to keep dumping water on it.
[01:38:59.823 --> 01:39:02.905]  It just got hit by another typhoon, another big earthquake.
[01:39:02.905 --> 01:39:07.447]  I hope everything's okay because I don't want to have to move to the Southern Hemisphere.
[01:39:08.507 --> 01:39:18.951]  I mean, I morally cannot leave my children here when this is all going on, if the radiation levels continue to go up much more.
[01:39:18.951 --> 01:39:23.293]  I'll obviously stay behind while I try to see who wants to move to the Southern Hemisphere with me.
[01:39:23.293 --> 01:39:25.414]  But, I mean, I can't believe I have to think about this.
[01:39:25.414 --> 01:39:28.575]  I mean, I'm really having to think about this.
[01:39:28.575 --> 01:39:30.516]  I'm really having to deal with this, okay?
[01:39:30.516 --> 01:39:33.237]  And so I hope they can get it under control.
[01:39:33.237 --> 01:39:36.398]  But regardless, look at the new study that's out.
[01:39:36.398 --> 01:39:37.919]  Changes in confirmed
[01:39:39.192 --> 01:39:52.958]  Plus borderline cases of congenital hyperthyroidism in California as function of environmental fallout from the Fukushima nuclear meltdown, the Journal of Pediatrics.
[01:39:52.958 --> 01:39:55.339]  That is so incredibly important.
[01:39:56.334 --> 01:39:58.595]  And yes, that's the reason.
[01:39:58.595 --> 01:40:17.064]  I was already planning to come out with a high-quality supplement line, but I dithered around, you know, trying to find out what the very best stuff was, and then doing research for my own family of the cleanest, purest, best, unbound nascent iodine to give my wife and children and myself, I found this proprietary nascent iodine that no one even knew about.
[01:40:17.064 --> 01:40:21.526]  I tried the other brands and couldn't hold them down, and basically did research on it and found out that
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.981]  They break down over time.
[01:40:23.981 --> 01:40:25.761]  This is proprietary.
[01:40:25.761 --> 01:40:27.182]  This really is special.
[01:40:27.182 --> 01:40:30.183]  It's double the strength at half the cost of leading competitors.
[01:40:30.183 --> 01:40:36.085]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:40:36.085 --> 01:40:48.690]  And the thyroid, other glands for my research and what I believe and what I'm doing for my family is that this is one of the things that I can do so that these glands don't take in the isotopes
[01:40:50.529 --> 01:40:56.834]  That they will if my glands, like my thyroid, do not have enough of the quality iodine.
[01:40:56.834 --> 01:41:01.558]  It also, on record, detoxifies out the fluoride that's in your body.
[01:41:01.558 --> 01:41:08.103]  But I will warn you, about a month into this, I kind of had a heartburn and felt a little cruddy on top of having extra energy.
[01:41:08.103 --> 01:41:10.405]  So it was kind of a best of times, worst of times.
[01:41:10.405 --> 01:41:13.967]  Now I don't feel like that anymore and I just have accelerating clarity.
[01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:15.368]  You name it.
[01:41:15.368 --> 01:41:19.572]  But I've learned other things I do in my life that are toxic, I've got to stop them.
[01:41:20.091 --> 01:41:23.113]  I can't go out and drink a couple glasses of wine anymore with dinner.
[01:41:23.113 --> 01:41:31.059]  I'm going to just warn people up front that once you start to detoxify, your body's like, uh-uh.
[01:41:31.059 --> 01:41:32.320]  You know, no more.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:41.747]  And so it has had the effect of making me as mean as a rattlesnake sometimes, because I'm just getting more and more clarity and more and more aggression.
[01:41:41.747 --> 01:41:45.450]  Because that's what pharmacist Ben Fuchs said it would do, is he said it would make me a manly man.
[01:41:46.331 --> 01:41:50.455]  Is it just does all this stuff reportedly to your other glands and the hormones and stuff.
[01:41:50.455 --> 01:41:52.276]  And yes, my muscles have gotten bigger.
[01:41:52.276 --> 01:41:54.979]  I'm not even lifting weights, folks.
[01:41:54.979 --> 01:41:55.879]  And I feel like I'm 18.
[01:41:55.879 --> 01:41:59.042]  I mean, I just it's unbelievable.
[01:41:59.042 --> 01:42:03.206]  I mean, when I got my clothes off, you know, getting out of the shower or whatever, I'm like, wow.
[01:42:03.206 --> 01:42:08.591]  I mean, I'm scared to go lift weights because I don't want to look like, you know, Brutus the Beefcake or something.
[01:42:08.591 --> 01:42:11.853]  I'm trying to lose weight and I have lost fat, but it's just like
[01:42:12.677 --> 01:42:17.600]  But Fuke says that's what you're supposed to be like when you're natural and, you know, the way you are.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.762]  So it's just doing a lot for my glance.
[01:42:19.762 --> 01:42:23.864]  And, you know, women that are on it, it makes them more feminine from what I've seen personally.
[01:42:23.864 --> 01:42:25.986]  Again, those are just my observations.
[01:42:25.986 --> 01:42:30.649]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:30.649 --> 01:42:34.131]  And I'm done plugging now.
[01:42:34.131 --> 01:42:35.172]  Thank you for your support.
[01:42:35.172 --> 01:42:36.552]  You make the broadcast possible.
[01:42:36.552 --> 01:42:40.135]  Be sure and support our local AM and FM affiliates out there.
[01:42:41.738 --> 01:42:45.241]  Be sure and support their local sponsors or become a local sponsor.
[01:42:45.241 --> 01:42:48.803]  That is absolutely essential and always spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:42:48.803 --> 01:42:54.788]  I want to go to your phone calls before I start the next hour and go to Dr. Busby.
[01:42:54.788 --> 01:42:58.010]  But just some of the other news that is so huge right now.
[01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:59.892]  This is out of Ynet News.
[01:42:59.892 --> 01:43:04.675]  It has the best boil down from the Sunday Times of London.
[01:43:04.675 --> 01:43:09.319]  And I just couldn't imagine a story more important except for maybe Fukushima.
[01:43:11.283 --> 01:43:22.655]  And top economists like Mark Faber coming out saying that the end of the capitalist economic system as we know it is coming because of the kleptocratic insiders setting up this tyranny.
[01:43:22.655 --> 01:43:28.841]  But you read this article from Ynet News and the BBC is also reporting it.
[01:43:28.841 --> 01:43:31.163]  Nuclear weapons are being transferred to Saudi Arabia.
[01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:31.724]  They're already there.
[01:43:31.724 --> 01:43:32.545]  I already told you that.
[01:43:32.545 --> 01:43:33.426]  You heard that here first.
[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:37.822]  I mean, they're still debating whether Israel has nuclear weapons.
[01:43:37.822 --> 01:43:46.768]  They've got 800 nuclear weapons, cruise missile, ICBM, medium range delivered, artillery delivered, bomber delivered.
[01:43:46.768 --> 01:43:52.392]  Okay, I mean, Israel is one of the most powerful nuclear powers in the world.
[01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:56.555]  Because they don't just have 800 warheads, that's Jane's Weapons Quarterly.
[01:43:56.555 --> 01:44:04.501]  They've got some of the most high tech delivery systems, and they're right in the middle of Europe, the Middle East, and Russia.
[01:44:06.391 --> 01:44:15.358]  Israel is basically a giant 51st state aircraft carrier loaded with weapons systems and troops.
[01:44:15.358 --> 01:44:17.540]  And again, I'm not against Israel.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:19.282]  I want Israel to do great.
[01:44:19.282 --> 01:44:20.963]  We have a lot of great listeners in Israel.
[01:44:20.963 --> 01:44:22.805]  I get orders all the time from Israel, every day.
[01:44:22.805 --> 01:44:30.391]  I mean, we care about Israel, but we also care about Iran and their people, 70 plus percent hate the Mullahs.
[01:44:30.391 --> 01:44:31.512]  We care about
[01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:44.560]  Syria being attacked by Al-Qaeda, and shame on Israel, and shame on the US, and shame on NATO, funding Al-Qaeda to attack Syria, and saying, well, you know, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:45.300]  No!
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:52.626]  No, no, it's immoral to start a war with Syria, who's doing nothing to anybody, and try to take them down, just so you can get at Iran next.
[01:44:52.626 --> 01:44:55.408]  It's unbelievable.
[01:44:55.408 --> 01:44:58.871]  So again, Pakistan is building nuclear weapons for Saudi Arabia.
[01:44:58.871 --> 01:45:00.553]  That's what the BBC is saying.
[01:45:02.066 --> 01:45:08.731]  And that came out last week, but now here it is back in the news.
[01:45:08.731 --> 01:45:10.052]  They've already built them years ago.
[01:45:10.052 --> 01:45:11.773]  They've already transferred them.
[01:45:11.773 --> 01:45:15.836]  They're just publicly threatening Iran in case Iran doesn't know.
[01:45:15.836 --> 01:45:19.118]  But here's the rest of the story.
[01:45:19.118 --> 01:45:26.724]  I was told five and a half, six years ago by a high-level military source that Alex, we're not going to be hitting Iran or the military has anything to do with it.
[01:45:26.724 --> 01:45:29.186]  They've got atomic weapons.
[01:45:29.186 --> 01:45:30.587]  They've got missiles to deliver them.
[01:45:32.072 --> 01:45:34.014]  And they are going to hit Israel.
[01:45:34.014 --> 01:45:38.918]  And then Israel is going to hit them back and destroy their entire country.
[01:45:38.918 --> 01:45:41.240]  And then Russia and China are going to get involved.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:43.782]  And India will probably nuke Pakistan.
[01:45:43.782 --> 01:45:45.263]  And that's how this works.
[01:45:45.263 --> 01:45:49.167]  And I've told you this hundreds of times about this in the last five and a half years.
[01:45:50.225 --> 01:45:54.368]  Then, a couple years after that, I talked to another source, and they said, yes, that's the intel.
[01:45:54.368 --> 01:46:09.317]  And that's why the Pentagon does not want to hit Iran, because the mullahs are crazy enough, folks, to fire atomic bombs on the heads of missiles at Israel.
[01:46:09.317 --> 01:46:12.759]  And it won't matter if they've got Iron Dome and shoot stuff down at 10,000 feet in the air.
[01:46:13.826 --> 01:46:17.349]  The Iranians will just have the nukes detonate at 10,000 feet.
[01:46:17.349 --> 01:46:30.878]  That's one of the... I mean, that will absolutely blow everything out in Israel, all their electronics, EMP, and will send a shockwave down, depending on how powerful the weapon is, that will probably kill tens of thousands of people.
[01:46:30.878 --> 01:46:36.782]  If they don't stop it and it airbursts at 2,000 feet, Tel Aviv or Jerusalem will be destroyed.
[01:46:36.782 --> 01:46:40.465]  Do you really want Jerusalem hit by an atomic bomb?
[01:46:41.581 --> 01:46:44.562]  The Pentagon will attack whoever the new world order tells them to.
[01:46:44.562 --> 01:46:45.462]  They always have.
[01:46:45.462 --> 01:46:52.963]  They're war fighters though, and they're going, the computers and the analysts say this is probably going to start World War III.
[01:46:52.963 --> 01:46:55.723]  I got a golf game coming up today.
[01:46:55.723 --> 01:46:58.084]  I got grandkids.
[01:46:58.084 --> 01:47:01.504]  It's one thing to suck America dry and set up a police state and all this stuff.
[01:47:01.504 --> 01:47:05.425]  Sure, we'll go along with that, because I live in a gated community.
[01:47:05.425 --> 01:47:07.205]  You know, that's their worldview.
[01:47:07.205 --> 01:47:09.226]  We live in a gated community, so so what?
[01:47:09.226 --> 01:47:10.746]  But you're not insulated from war.
[01:47:12.907 --> 01:47:14.087]  Especially nuclear war.
[01:47:14.087 --> 01:47:18.309]  And the Russians have said this will probably cause a nuclear war back off in Syria.
[01:47:18.309 --> 01:47:20.890]  Don't attack or we may nuke you.
[01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:28.653]  And then the head of the Joint Chiefs went on the eve of the attack on Syria and said, don't do it.
[01:47:29.741 --> 01:47:38.725]  And then Obama started firing and removing generals and admirals because he didn't want them to be removed or fired or resign over his military handling.
[01:47:38.725 --> 01:47:42.987]  No, they back off and then start getting kicked out of there because they won't follow orders.
[01:47:44.423 --> 01:47:52.048]  And then we start hearing, oh, Iran's going to nuke America the day we come out and report that nuclear weapons are missing.
[01:47:52.048 --> 01:47:57.531]  By the way, my cell phone is so tapped now that it just starts typing and sending people emails.
[01:47:57.531 --> 01:47:59.473]  I don't even have an email account on there.
[01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:01.294]  It starts just taking pictures.
[01:48:01.294 --> 01:48:02.574]  It starts calling people.
[01:48:02.574 --> 01:48:03.295]  People are on it.
[01:48:03.295 --> 01:48:07.638]  I mean, obviously Alex Jones's cell phone is tapped, but I mean, I got to get rid of it now.
[01:48:07.638 --> 01:48:09.199]  I guess I can't have a cell phone now.
[01:48:13.917 --> 01:48:18.421]  Because they're literally on it all the time now.
[01:48:18.421 --> 01:48:26.168]  And I can get another cell phone, and then in two days, whatever malware it is they put on it, they're following me around again, and it's on record they're doing it.
[01:48:26.168 --> 01:48:35.397]  I mean, this is so screwed up, ladies and gentlemen, that we're telling you about missing nuclear weapons from Dyess Air Force Base, and I'm the one with my phone tapped.
[01:48:37.304 --> 01:48:41.647]  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, they all have access to your NSA data.
[01:48:41.647 --> 01:48:44.929]  The advertising hubs, Google, is given the NSA data.
[01:48:44.929 --> 01:48:48.291]  They co-house facilities with NASA and the NSA.
[01:48:48.291 --> 01:48:53.354]  They're spying on everything we do in a giant criminal conspiracy against humanity.
[01:48:53.354 --> 01:48:54.854]  And they're crazy.
[01:48:54.854 --> 01:49:01.859]  And thank God the military, who I don't romanticize at the top, has said no to starting World War III.
[01:49:01.859 --> 01:49:05.541]  And so now Israel and Saudi Arabia
[01:49:07.651 --> 01:49:19.527]  Are saying, okay, okay, if you have peace talks with Iran that allow them to have nuclear reactors, we're going to go ahead and hit them.
[01:49:19.527 --> 01:49:23.171]  And by the way, we've transferred nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia.
[01:49:24.005 --> 01:49:26.027]  And they're claiming Pakistan did it.
[01:49:26.027 --> 01:49:29.270]  I'm sure they did buy four weapons from Pakistan.
[01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:31.072]  That's what I was told a long time ago.
[01:49:31.072 --> 01:49:35.397]  But I was also told they got it from Russian elements and the Israelis.
[01:49:35.397 --> 01:49:37.399]  It's the Israelis that are selling everything to China.
[01:49:37.399 --> 01:49:38.159]  All our technology.
[01:49:38.936 --> 01:49:41.117]  Which the Pentagon knows full well is going on.
[01:49:41.117 --> 01:50:00.204]  So this is madness, ladies and gentlemen, and if Iran already has the nuclear weapons, why then do you want to strike them if they put reactors online that is very hard to make atomic weapon material, much less hydrogen weapon material, from the physicists we've talked to, out of that?
[01:50:00.204 --> 01:50:03.966]  Why on earth would you
[01:50:06.897 --> 01:50:17.444]  want to do this and and and it's just ancient tribal warfare between these groups and the Sunnis absolutely hate the Shiites and vice versa and you see the Saudi Arabia is in a war.
[01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:29.653]  Saudi Arabia in 1903 through 1933 came from an area of less than a hundred square miles with a vicious Bedouin Wahhabist tribe that literally had women in slave pits
[01:50:30.473 --> 01:50:39.761]  And then they took over all of what is Saudi Arabia today, and then took over a bunch of other areas, and now the West is backing them to take over the entire Middle East.
[01:50:39.761 --> 01:50:44.886]  Look this up, this is in Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:50:44.886 --> 01:50:47.288]  And now, they're being given nuclear weapons.
[01:50:48.547 --> 01:50:52.009]  By the way, you know the Saudis will bring a bomb over here and blow it up and blame it on Iran.
[01:50:52.009 --> 01:50:52.789]  You know that.
[01:50:52.789 --> 01:50:54.810]  They were deeply involved in 9-11.
[01:50:54.810 --> 01:50:56.871]  But that's okay, because they're so sweet.
[01:50:56.871 --> 01:50:59.533]  They're where Al-Qaeda comes from, so they're the good guys.
[01:50:59.533 --> 01:51:01.574]  And I'm the bad guy.
[01:51:01.574 --> 01:51:06.936]  There are those curious about Bitcoins, and those using and making money with Bitcoins.
[01:51:06.936 --> 01:51:08.557]  What are Bitcoins?
[01:51:08.557 --> 01:51:15.060]  A Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the Internet.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:16.461]  No bank needed.
[01:51:16.861 --> 01:51:22.543]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[01:51:22.543 --> 01:51:24.824]  You are in control of your money.
[01:51:24.824 --> 01:51:25.985]  And the best part?
[01:51:25.985 --> 01:51:29.606]  You can start earning and making money with Bitcoins right away.
[01:51:29.606 --> 01:51:36.989]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with Bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept Bitcoins.
[01:51:37.429 --> 01:51:41.491]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros, and more.

[01:52:06.139 --> 01:52:08.782]  If there was no way to get medical help, what would you do?
[01:52:08.782 --> 01:52:15.391]  How are you going to protect the safety of your family during a crisis when there are no doctors, hospitals, emergency services, or supplies?
[01:52:16.032 --> 01:52:18.134]  Supernatural Silver is the answer.

[01:54:31.423 --> 01:54:34.165]  Then after Dr. Busby leaves us, I'll go back to more of your calls.
[01:54:34.165 --> 01:54:35.986]  The Weekly Standard has video up.
[01:54:35.986 --> 01:54:37.947]  It's on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:54:37.947 --> 01:54:40.029]  We'll get it added to InfoWars.com.
[01:54:40.029 --> 01:54:45.393]  A Democratic rep says Obama lacks legal underpinning for Obamacare fix.
[01:54:45.393 --> 01:54:47.815]  That's what Nick Rall said.
[01:54:47.815 --> 01:54:50.116]  But you've also got the former head of the DNC.
[01:54:51.597 --> 01:54:58.040]  Uh, coming out, uh, saying that they don't have the legal authority to do that outside of Congress.
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:54:59.800]  Well, did you get the memo?
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:08.344]  Whether it's shutting down coal power plants or putting our military under NATO or, um, legalizing illegals?
[01:55:08.344 --> 01:55:10.585]  Obama acts as a dictator now.
[01:55:10.585 --> 01:55:12.906]  And he'll probably leave office, but it won't matter.
[01:55:12.906 --> 01:55:19.068]  Dictatorial powers will now be cemented in the office of the presidency.
[01:55:19.068 --> 01:55:20.849]  Kind of a big deal.
[01:55:23.345 --> 01:55:28.807]  Oh, now Kyan West says he's past Obama, feels used by the President.
[01:55:28.807 --> 01:55:36.790]  When those type of trendies start jumping ship on you, you know you are in deep, deep you-know-what.
[01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:40.271]  I'm telling you, Obama and his handlers, though, are the most dangerous now.
[01:55:40.271 --> 01:55:43.392]  They could try to start a war, anything right now, to get them out of it.
[01:55:43.392 --> 01:55:48.994]  We are at the moment of maximum danger, and Israel, with Saudi Arabia as two buddies,
[01:55:50.981 --> 01:55:54.547]  Are threatening to basically nuke Iran preemptively.
[01:55:54.547 --> 01:55:58.093]  But that's not even a big news issue here in America.
[01:55:58.093 --> 01:56:01.119]  No, actually, whatever Kayan West is up to is big news, or whatever.
[01:56:03.579 --> 01:56:05.740]  Somebody in the NFL is up to his big news.
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:11.864]  I'm just sorry, I can't get concerned about that when the West Coast is glowing from radiation from Fukushima.
[01:56:11.864 --> 01:56:12.965]  It's getting worse.
[01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:15.206]  They're about to start World War III.
[01:56:15.206 --> 01:56:18.688]  They're devaluing the currency at warp speed.
[01:56:18.688 --> 01:56:24.532]  They're building up military power against the American people, militarizing the police.
[01:56:27.486 --> 01:56:28.066]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:56:28.066 --> 01:56:31.028]  I'd like to first say that I really appreciate your supporters and your dedication.
[01:56:54.226 --> 01:56:57.488]  Okay, um, as well as, uh, you know, your products.
[01:56:57.488 --> 01:56:58.509]  It was crazy.
[01:56:58.509 --> 01:57:08.697]  I got a couple of your t-shirts and the first day I wore the Obama t-shirt, when it said Tyrant, I had five people come up and shake my hand and, you know, call me a patriot.
[01:57:08.697 --> 01:57:14.161]  Oh yeah, if you want to meet like-minded people, wear a, uh, come and take it shirt.
[01:57:14.161 --> 01:57:18.024]  And, uh, you will, uh, you will find a lot of compadres.
[01:57:19.312 --> 01:57:27.996]  Yeah, I mean, I've been taking the nascent iodine for the past month, and the only way I could describe it is, I mean, I feel a lot more energized.
[01:57:27.996 --> 01:57:30.238]  But I really wanted to get the word out today.
[01:57:30.238 --> 01:57:39.903]  I mean, I have so much I'd like to talk about, but I'd like to talk about the LFTR, the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor.
[01:57:39.903 --> 01:57:45.906]  It's way better than the water, light water reactors that we have, you know, in Fukushima.
[01:57:47.065 --> 01:57:48.206]  Yeah, I'm no physicist.
[01:57:48.206 --> 01:57:52.749]  I'm not a nuclear physicist, but there are better forms of nuclear energy.
[01:57:52.749 --> 01:57:56.531]  Instead, they're building more of the old designs that are so terrible.
[01:57:56.531 --> 01:57:58.292]  And look, I used to be a fan of nuclear power.
[01:57:58.292 --> 01:58:00.333]  I used to buy the propaganda.
[01:58:00.333 --> 01:58:07.718]  But now they just don't even maintenance the facilities properly, and they're constantly having disasters, and now they're covering them up.
[01:58:07.718 --> 01:58:09.799]  So I say, get rid of nuclear power.
[01:58:09.799 --> 01:58:10.360]  I'm done with it.
[01:58:12.287 --> 01:58:13.288]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:58:13.288 --> 01:58:15.509]  I mean, it's totally terrible.
[01:58:15.509 --> 01:58:25.635]  The only reason why we went with this uranium water-based light water solid fuel reactor is because we... Military applications on submarines, yeah?
[01:58:25.635 --> 01:58:26.776]  Exactly.
[01:58:26.776 --> 01:58:27.276]  Exactly.
[01:58:27.276 --> 01:58:32.199]  The thorium reactor, what happens is they can't make bombs out of that.
[01:58:32.199 --> 01:58:36.602]  That's why they didn't go with it, but... I'm not going to respond to your intellectual argument.
[01:58:36.602 --> 01:58:38.924]  I think the word thorium sounded racist.
[01:58:39.804 --> 01:58:41.206]  Very racist.
[01:58:41.206 --> 01:58:44.410]  Any time you encounter anything intellectual, just say it's racist.
[01:58:44.410 --> 01:58:46.333]  That makes you intellectually smarter.
[01:58:46.333 --> 01:58:49.096]  I'm smarter than the last caller because I called him racist.
[01:58:49.096 --> 01:58:50.098]  We'll be right back, racist.
[01:58:51.095 --> 01:58:52.996]  Introducing Pro-1.

[02:00:05.861 --> 02:00:07.161]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.161 --> 02:00:08.942]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.942 --> 02:00:10.702]  Government cover-ups.

[02:00:12.282 --> 02:00:13.822]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.822 --> 02:00:18.023]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.023 --> 02:00:22.084]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.195 --> 02:00:37.644]  We're back live, taking your phone calls.
[02:00:37.644 --> 02:00:40.029]  Let's talk to John in Oklahoma.
[02:00:40.029 --> 02:00:40.811]  John, you're on the air.
[02:00:40.811 --> 02:00:41.373]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:41.373 --> 02:00:42.776]  We're going to go to Cupcake.
[02:00:42.776 --> 02:00:43.318]  Welcome, John.
[02:00:44.470 --> 02:01:05.062]  I just got off the phone with TSA after getting re-fired up about the little detention pods and asked them about the security announcement that they played there in Houston and just to find out what the guidelines were and it ended up, I recorded the conversation, it ended up that they really don't have any guidelines.
[02:01:05.062 --> 02:01:06.803]  It's pretty much up to the officer's discretion.
[02:01:07.023 --> 02:01:08.484]  Yeah, and they're not even a sworn officer.
[02:01:08.484 --> 02:01:08.764]  No, no.
[02:01:08.764 --> 02:01:12.926]  They're saying if they don't like the way you look, they're going to have you arrested.
[02:01:12.926 --> 02:01:14.647]  And then they'll trump something up later.
[02:01:14.647 --> 02:01:16.909]  This is literal intimidation now.
[02:01:16.909 --> 02:01:21.131]  If you make a joke, if you say you don't like something, we're going to arrest you.
[02:01:21.131 --> 02:01:22.592]  Well, I say then let them do it.
[02:01:22.592 --> 02:01:23.632]  Let's go to court.
[02:01:23.632 --> 02:01:25.133]  Let's sue everybody.
[02:01:25.133 --> 02:01:27.114]  This is the new civil rights movement.
[02:01:27.114 --> 02:01:29.676]  They are trying to treat us all like slaves.
[02:01:29.676 --> 02:01:31.277]  We are going back into slavery.
[02:01:31.277 --> 02:01:32.797]  Everyone is going into slavery.
[02:01:32.797 --> 02:01:34.818]  That's what governments always try to do.
[02:01:34.818 --> 02:01:35.499]  It's happening now.
[02:01:35.819 --> 02:01:37.560]  You should put the conversation up on YouTube.
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:39.381]  It'll become a news story.
[02:01:39.381 --> 02:01:41.383]  Okay, I'll just do that.
[02:01:41.383 --> 02:01:45.085]  I also asked her, she said, well, it'll result in a civil fine of $1,500.
[02:01:45.085 --> 02:01:50.009]  And I said, well, what about the arrest part?
[02:01:50.009 --> 02:01:54.312]  What law did they arrest you on for exercising free speech?
[02:01:54.312 --> 02:01:56.533]  And she didn't know about that.
[02:01:56.533 --> 02:01:57.534]  Well, let me say this.
[02:01:57.534 --> 02:01:58.955]  You see, that's what I should do.
[02:01:58.955 --> 02:02:02.998]  And I got great reporters, but what you're saying is that I default
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:16.104]  When Paul Watson came out with that article and it was on Drudge for three days, a top story, and got two million readers or whatever it had, I should have said, let's call TSA and get them on record about this.
[02:02:16.104 --> 02:02:23.086]  Let's go to the airport and let's get the Austin TSA spokespeople to tell us.
[02:02:23.086 --> 02:02:27.528]  So that, I'm going to assign that, I know my reporters are listening, whoever wants to do it.
[02:02:28.448 --> 02:02:35.251]  I want you to call their public information person, and I want you to record it, tell them you're doing an interview, then I want you to say you want to drive out there.
[02:02:35.251 --> 02:02:41.814]  And then we've been out there before, and when you drive out, they'll act like you've done something wrong, showing up with a camera, while they spy on everything you do, including when you're not even there.
[02:02:42.817 --> 02:02:46.958]  They spy on your outside activity via the NSA, that's all come out, all your databases.
[02:02:46.958 --> 02:02:56.722]  They tie into hundreds of private databases before you show up there as if you're a threat, as if you've done something wrong, violating your Fourth Amendment, invading your privacy.
[02:02:56.722 --> 02:02:58.763]  And so we need to do what you've done.
[02:02:58.763 --> 02:03:01.183]  Do you have a YouTube account, sir?
[02:03:01.183 --> 02:03:04.344]  Well, I do, but I've never uploaded anything.
[02:03:04.344 --> 02:03:06.325]  Well, listen, I'd love to hear this.
[02:03:06.325 --> 02:03:09.306]  What TSA facility did you call?
[02:03:09.306 --> 02:03:10.567]  Their 800 number.
[02:03:13.348 --> 02:03:16.029]  I said, well, gosh, it sounds like it's pretty broad.
[02:03:16.029 --> 02:03:19.770]  They can arrest me for not liking the way I cut my hair.
[02:03:19.770 --> 02:03:21.851]  And she said, no, no, that's not in there.
[02:03:21.851 --> 02:03:23.651]  I said, well, you're telling me there's nothing in there.
[02:03:23.651 --> 02:03:27.292]  So they've got a pretty broad brush on this thing.
[02:03:27.292 --> 02:03:28.452]  Well, that's what tyrannies like.
[02:03:28.452 --> 02:03:30.013]  They just say, hey, where'd Bob go?
[02:03:30.013 --> 02:03:31.373]  Hey, he disappeared.
[02:03:31.373 --> 02:03:32.494]  We didn't like what you said.
[02:03:32.494 --> 02:03:38.075]  And if you say you don't like us grabbing your genitals, we take that as an insult to our lordship.
[02:03:38.075 --> 02:03:40.496]  Look, you don't criticize the government in North Korea either.
[02:03:41.644 --> 02:03:45.426]  Americans are to sit down, shut up, and do what they're told.
[02:03:45.426 --> 02:03:48.848]  You saw the minivan where they run away with the kids in the car so the cops shoot it?
[02:03:48.848 --> 02:03:51.750]  I think there should be a government bomb in every car.
[02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:56.233]  If you don't salute the police, I think they should blow your car up.
[02:03:56.233 --> 02:04:05.118]  I think if you don't pay a parking ticket, your children should be executed by guillotine in front of the White House, and Obama should bathe in your blood.
[02:04:05.118 --> 02:04:08.600]  Because he is our Lord and Savior, sir.
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:09.501]  Don't give him any ideas.
[02:04:10.973 --> 02:04:14.395]  Well, listen, I will, uh, so what you called the TSA 1-800 line?
[02:04:14.395 --> 02:04:17.636]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:17.636 --> 02:04:19.937]  And, uh, it was about a five minute long conversation.
[02:04:19.937 --> 02:04:27.661]  She put me on hold and, and, uh, uh, she couldn't tell me, though, that they could actually arrest me.
[02:04:27.661 --> 02:04:29.662]  Well, no, it's all, it's all a threat.
[02:04:29.662 --> 02:04:33.544]  Submit to us, go in the little cages, or we're going to arrest you.
[02:04:33.544 --> 02:04:39.246]  I tell you what, if you want to give us your name and number, we'll call you right now and help you get on one of our YouTube channels and upload that.
[02:04:39.246 --> 02:04:40.007]  Do you know how to upload?
[02:04:40.934 --> 02:04:43.756]  Uh, yeah, I'll figure it out.
[02:04:43.756 --> 02:04:44.937]  That sounds great.
[02:04:44.937 --> 02:04:53.103]  Hey, by the way, you don't have any problem with, uh, unlicensed radio stations running your show, do you?
[02:05:01.741 --> 02:05:07.203]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:05:07.203 --> 02:05:16.105]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:05:16.105 --> 02:05:23.928]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:05:23.928 --> 02:05:31.330]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[02:06:00.805 --> 02:06:05.528]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:06:05.528 --> 02:06:08.650]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:06:08.650 --> 02:06:14.214]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:06:14.214 --> 02:06:16.155]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:06:16.155 --> 02:06:17.776]  We are what we eat.
[02:06:17.776 --> 02:06:22.459]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:06:22.459 --> 02:06:26.362]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoffs.
[02:06:26.642 --> 02:06:29.224]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:06:29.224 --> 02:06:35.447]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:07:01.269 --> 02:07:07.911]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[02:07:07.911 --> 02:07:10.372]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[02:07:10.372 --> 02:07:10.752]  The U.S.
[02:07:10.752 --> 02:07:14.973]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[02:07:14.973 --> 02:07:17.934]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[02:07:17.934 --> 02:07:19.434]  They want that attack to come.
[02:07:19.434 --> 02:07:25.616]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[02:07:26.004 --> 02:07:28.666]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[02:07:28.666 --> 02:07:33.651]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[02:07:33.651 --> 02:07:41.077]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[02:07:41.377 --> 02:07:44.141]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[02:07:44.141 --> 02:07:47.245]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[02:08:04.056 --> 02:08:09.021]  For 50 years, we've told them what to eat, what to drink, what to wear!
[02:08:09.021 --> 02:08:11.664]  For Christ's sake, Ben, don't you understand?
[02:08:11.664 --> 02:08:13.907]  Americans love television!
[02:08:13.907 --> 02:08:16.089]  They wean their kids on it!
[02:08:16.089 --> 02:08:22.055]  Listen, they love game shows, they love wrestling, they love sports and violence!
[02:08:22.055 --> 02:08:24.278]  So what do we do?
[02:08:24.278 --> 02:08:25.819]  We give them what they want!
[02:08:27.486 --> 02:08:29.226]  We're number one, Ben!
[02:08:29.226 --> 02:08:30.767]  That's all that counts!
[02:08:30.767 --> 02:08:33.908]  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years!
[02:08:33.908 --> 02:08:37.549]  Well, I haven't been in show business as long as you have, Killian.
[02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:38.389]  But I'm a quick learner.
[02:08:38.389 --> 02:08:43.470]  So I'm going to give the audience what I think they want.
[02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:49.492]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:08:58.627 --> 02:09:00.648]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[02:09:00.648 --> 02:09:04.491]  It is Monday, the 18th day of November, 2013.
[02:09:04.491 --> 02:09:09.594]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're into the final hour right now.
[02:09:09.594 --> 02:09:12.856]  Coming up at the start of the next segment, look at these headlines.
[02:09:12.856 --> 02:09:16.699]  Fukushima operators begin risky nuclear fuel rod removal.
[02:09:16.699 --> 02:09:16.739]  RT.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:20.560]  Here's CBS News.
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:25.622]  Workers begin removing fuel rods from Japan's tsunami-battered Fukushima nuclear plant.
[02:09:25.622 --> 02:09:33.743]  If they touch one rod to another, they explode and catch on fire, many times worse than the last Fukushima disaster that's still ongoing.
[02:09:33.743 --> 02:09:37.124]  Radioactive leaks found at 75% of nuke sites.
[02:09:37.124 --> 02:09:38.264]  CBS News.
[02:09:38.264 --> 02:09:42.725]  The numbers I've got from the International Atomic Energy Agency is 91% are leaking.
[02:09:47.543 --> 02:09:48.664]  Ninety-one percent.
[02:09:48.664 --> 02:09:56.288]  I'm going to ask Dr. Busby, nuclear and chemical physicist coming up, exactly is it 75 or is it 91?
[02:09:56.288 --> 02:09:57.368]  Doesn't really matter either way.
[02:09:57.368 --> 02:10:03.491]  Yeah, of course, the CBS article is two years old, so that's probably why they now say 91.
[02:10:03.491 --> 02:10:06.093]  The issue is they just don't care now if they're leaking.
[02:10:06.093 --> 02:10:07.954]  It's just madness.
[02:10:07.954 --> 02:10:11.836]  And then we have this new Journal of Pediatrics paper out.
[02:10:12.932 --> 02:10:23.034]  That babies are getting thyroid disorders and it's being connected to the increased radioactive fallout from Fukushima that blows right across into the West Coast.
[02:10:23.034 --> 02:10:26.595]  This is huge news, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:26.595 --> 02:10:34.316]  And NBC LA reports concerns over multiple illnesses forced Malibu High School classroom to shut down.
[02:10:34.316 --> 02:10:36.957]  Three teachers die in one classroom.
[02:10:36.957 --> 02:10:37.417]  I mean, what?
[02:10:38.635 --> 02:10:39.936]  Or have gotten cancer.
[02:10:39.936 --> 02:10:42.899]  Other people in Japan have been dying nearby the schools there.
[02:10:42.899 --> 02:10:44.540]  That's two different articles we've got.
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:50.865]  So just really, really wild stuff there that we're going to be looking at.
[02:10:50.865 --> 02:10:57.210]  And the numbers in Japan of the deaths and the numbers of the illnesses here in the United States.
[02:10:57.210 --> 02:10:58.812]  So that is coming up.
[02:10:58.812 --> 02:11:00.233]  Here is some of the other big news.
[02:11:00.233 --> 02:11:01.354]  I mentioned this last hour.
[02:11:01.914 --> 02:11:03.796]  But if we have time later, we'll play the clip.
[02:11:03.796 --> 02:11:10.902]  Democrat representative says Obama lacks legal underpinning for Obamacare fix.
[02:11:10.902 --> 02:11:14.465]  Nick Rahal says that it's law.
[02:11:14.465 --> 02:11:18.049]  The president can't change a law without going and changing the law.
[02:11:18.049 --> 02:11:20.171]  Well, we don't need no stinking laws.
[02:11:20.171 --> 02:11:21.292]  I mean, we don't even need a Congress.
[02:11:22.518 --> 02:11:24.459]  We have NATO to command our military now.
[02:11:24.459 --> 02:11:27.000]  We have our Supreme UN leader.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.560]  So that's a big deal.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:35.683]  And also the Supreme Court blocks challenge to NSA phone tracking saying there is no Fourth Amendment.
[02:11:35.683 --> 02:11:42.445]  Chicago law professor claims no privacy in your emails as long as the content isn't used to detain or harass you.
[02:11:44.606 --> 02:11:48.909]  180 degrees different from the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Common Sense.
[02:11:48.909 --> 02:11:54.554]  Also, the bloody disaster of Libya and Iraq and Afghanistan is laid bare.
[02:11:54.554 --> 02:12:01.839]  The Leningradian admits that the West's intervention has turned these into de-industrialized nightmare hellholes.
[02:12:01.839 --> 02:12:03.560]  And they're claiming it's an accident.
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:05.482]  The West didn't know what they were doing.
[02:12:05.482 --> 02:12:13.548]  This is the established policy, is to turn the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia into backward hellholes.
[02:12:15.379 --> 02:12:16.520]  And block development.
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:25.107]  That is the true mega-racism against the Oriental people that live in that area.
[02:12:25.107 --> 02:12:27.008]  They even say the term Oriental is racist now.
[02:12:27.008 --> 02:12:30.451]  Any term is bad.
[02:12:30.451 --> 02:12:38.136]  You know, the average folks don't even know what the scientists would label the people that are there, but it is a caucasoid
[02:12:39.275 --> 02:12:42.358]  Oriental mixture with Africans.
[02:12:42.358 --> 02:12:50.405]  So it's a truly mixed group of people who are just human beings, because we're all human beings, and the West is exterminating them and using Al Qaeda to do it.
[02:12:50.405 --> 02:13:00.054]  A tiny Bedouin tribe that they've given all of Saudi Arabia to, they created it, made their only... into the second lineage now of the guy born in what, 1880?
[02:13:02.247 --> 02:13:07.729]  Who later by 1933 was declared the king of Saudi Arabia.
[02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:11.711]  Saudi Arabia has not had this king until 1933.
[02:13:11.711 --> 02:13:13.132]  Pull it up.
[02:13:13.132 --> 02:13:14.732]  The first monarch of Saudi Arabia.
[02:13:14.732 --> 02:13:16.853]  We can show TV viewers.
[02:13:16.853 --> 02:13:22.916]  And now they're being given the entire Middle East and North Africa.
[02:13:24.523 --> 02:13:26.344]  And Europe, for that matter.
[02:13:26.344 --> 02:13:35.068]  I mean, this is a globalist, bankster-funded jihad using the most radical sect of Islam, a sub-sect of Sunni.
[02:13:35.068 --> 02:13:40.390]  And by the way, they kill the Sunnis, you know, that don't sexually mutilate their women, that don't put bags on their heads.
[02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:42.351]  And I never heard Oprah Winfrey say anything about the Saudis.
[02:13:42.351 --> 02:13:43.071]  Oh, no, no.
[02:13:43.071 --> 02:13:46.893]  She's just out saying, if you disagree with Obama and Obamacare, you're racist, and quote,
[02:13:48.319 --> 02:13:49.620]  You need to die!
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:52.942]  You don't like Obama and you're calling him a liar!
[02:13:52.942 --> 02:13:57.925]  She said, she said, people call him liars and they're deeply racist.
[02:13:57.925 --> 02:13:58.285]  Oh really?
[02:13:58.285 --> 02:14:02.007]  If it was a white guy up there lying like this, I would be going after them.
[02:14:02.007 --> 02:14:06.149]  Of course, a white guy wouldn't be able to get away with this because of the political correctness, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:08.531]  That's why they got rid of the Republicans.
[02:14:08.531 --> 02:14:13.193]  You know, white guys, I mean, they're gonna put a woman in their necks, no matter what color she is.
[02:14:13.193 --> 02:14:13.914]  Oh, just get ready.
[02:14:14.718 --> 02:14:16.339]  They're going to play the women of America?
[02:14:16.339 --> 02:14:17.879]  Better do whatever she says.
[02:14:17.879 --> 02:14:20.200]  Hillary says you're against women.
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:22.942]  Oh yeah, I'm really against women.
[02:14:22.942 --> 02:14:26.083]  I absolutely love women.
[02:14:26.083 --> 02:14:28.284]  Men I don't like.
[02:14:28.284 --> 02:14:33.146]  The point is, is that this is so absolutely ridiculous.
[02:14:33.146 --> 02:14:37.188]  You want to get down to it folks, I'm bigoted against men.
[02:14:37.188 --> 02:14:38.929]  I don't like how they look.
[02:14:38.929 --> 02:14:39.949]  I don't like how they smell.
[02:14:39.949 --> 02:14:41.050]  They can stay away from me.
[02:14:41.050 --> 02:14:43.531]  I don't even like going in men's restrooms.
[02:14:44.889 --> 02:14:47.011]  I'll be honest with you, I think men stink.
[02:14:47.011 --> 02:14:51.874]  I mean, I like men that stand up for liberty and honor, I just don't want to be around them.
[02:14:51.874 --> 02:14:53.896]  But that's because I'm anti-male now.
[02:14:53.896 --> 02:14:56.558]  No, no, I just actually have choices in my life.
[02:14:56.558 --> 02:14:59.600]  Okay, I'm absolutely going crazy today here on air.
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:02.502]  It is just so incredibly frustrating to deal with all this.
[02:15:02.502 --> 02:15:04.464]  I will do whatever Hillary says when she's president.
[02:15:04.464 --> 02:15:05.084]  I love women.
[02:15:05.084 --> 02:15:05.585]  There, there you go.
[02:15:07.242 --> 02:15:12.345]  And if we get a gay president, I'll do whatever he says, or she says, or I'm anti-gay.
[02:15:12.345 --> 02:15:14.646]  See how this mindlessness works?
[02:15:14.646 --> 02:15:19.029]  How they just... I just keep marveling at what Oprah Winfrey said.
[02:15:19.029 --> 02:15:20.990]  I mean, I've already played the clip yesterday, so I won't play it again.
[02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:25.993]  It's up on Infowars.com, to the BBC, talking to a literal foppish pinhead moron.
[02:15:27.108 --> 02:15:29.230]  He's a political correct cult member.
[02:15:29.230 --> 02:15:34.874]  And she's like, you're a good creature, like patting him on the head like he's a monkey or something.
[02:15:34.874 --> 02:15:42.759]  And then she continues on to just say, if you don't agree with Obama, you're racist and you need to die.
[02:15:42.759 --> 02:15:47.362]  And he's literally just rubbing his hands together, getting off on it because this is their authoritarianism.
[02:15:47.362 --> 02:15:50.585]  She goes to eugenics meetings to depopulate Africa, folks.
[02:15:50.585 --> 02:15:53.527]  She knows full well she's just up there dividing and conquering.
[02:15:53.527 --> 02:15:54.868]  What a disgusting person.
[02:15:56.087 --> 02:15:59.889]  What a disgusting race-baiting person.
[02:15:59.889 --> 02:16:01.310]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:03.411]  Let's go to Cupcake.
[02:16:03.411 --> 02:16:05.813]  Cupcake's calling from FEMA Region 3.
[02:16:05.813 --> 02:16:10.456]  What former state are you in that's in FEMA Region 3, Cupcake?
[02:16:10.456 --> 02:16:11.916]  I'm in Southern Maryland.
[02:16:11.916 --> 02:16:21.022]  I'm south of D.C., probably 20 miles from Andrews, or whatever they're calling it.
[02:16:21.022 --> 02:16:22.643]  Andrews, Navy.
[02:16:25.848 --> 02:16:27.870]  I have no idea what they're calling it, but it was racist.
[02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:28.930]  Sounds racist, that's what matters.
[02:16:28.930 --> 02:16:29.951]  Go ahead.
[02:16:29.951 --> 02:16:43.839]  And actually, on a side issue about being by Andrews, our phone cuts out every time we drive by there on 95.
[02:16:43.839 --> 02:16:44.720]  Every single time we drive.
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:53.505]  Oh, there's all sorts of interference, all sorts of manipulation, but their engineering will already have into all the new phones, Droid or Apple-based.
[02:16:54.645 --> 02:17:04.730]  Where the police or the government hits one button and they can turn off every cell phone in the city, physically turn them off, or just block them recording audio or video.
[02:17:04.730 --> 02:17:06.111]  All the kill switches.
[02:17:06.111 --> 02:17:09.013]  Obama and the globalists got their internet kill switch.
[02:17:09.013 --> 02:17:11.934]  And they go, oh, Congress wouldn't pass it.
[02:17:11.934 --> 02:17:12.915]  No, no, it's true.
[02:17:12.915 --> 02:17:16.997]  They didn't put in law that the kill switch can be there, but they're doing it anyways.
[02:17:16.997 --> 02:17:20.359]  Because after all, who needs a law, you know?
[02:17:20.359 --> 02:17:21.479]  Right, right.
[02:17:21.479 --> 02:17:22.940]  Obama will take care of everything.
[02:17:23.587 --> 02:17:28.871]  Well, please don't say he lied to you about keeping your health insurance or the premiums wouldn't go up, they'd go down.
[02:17:28.871 --> 02:17:31.853]  Because if you say that, you need to die.
[02:17:31.853 --> 02:17:35.255]  Questioning Obama is because you're a racist.
[02:17:35.255 --> 02:17:45.021]  Yeah, I'm a little fortunate because my husband is union, but it doesn't mean we're losing it, but we're losing a lot of coverage.
[02:17:45.021 --> 02:17:46.582]  Well, that's right.
[02:17:46.582 --> 02:17:49.924]  And of course, Obama's talking about exempting the unions for now.
[02:17:49.924 --> 02:17:51.966]  Of course, that's not discrimination against everybody else.
[02:17:53.001 --> 02:17:58.883]  See, there's thousands of new forms of discrimination that are actually all the ancient forms of it.
[02:17:58.883 --> 02:18:04.944]  So they're making us obsess on the last forms of oppression instead of the old ones they're bringing back.
[02:18:04.944 --> 02:18:05.884]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:18:05.884 --> 02:18:17.007]  For we only recognize... We only recognize the ones that they tell us about instead of recognizing all the stuff they're doing to all of us together.
[02:18:17.007 --> 02:18:17.287]  Right.
[02:18:17.287 --> 02:18:19.408]  Well, I've been listening to you for about three years.
[02:18:20.186 --> 02:18:27.809]  And half the time I can keep up with you and half the time I have to listen again on that part.
[02:18:27.809 --> 02:18:30.990]  Well, if you're a cupcake, what type of icing do you have?
[02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:33.071]  Well, you're so knowledgeable about everything.
[02:18:33.071 --> 02:18:35.291]  I like coconut cream ones.
[02:18:35.291 --> 02:18:37.252]  You know, they have a little bit of the cream on the top.
[02:18:37.252 --> 02:18:42.174]  I don't like really sweet icing that has a coconut on top.
[02:18:42.174 --> 02:18:42.534]  Right.
[02:18:43.487 --> 02:19:02.661]  Hey, listen, I've got a, uh, well, as far as the family, say you want to take your family, uh, out of state or whatever, um, now would you hire a plane or would you go on a regular airplane with your family at this point?
[02:19:02.661 --> 02:19:05.383]  Okay, you know, I'm sorry, they were popping in my ear.
[02:19:05.383 --> 02:19:07.205]  What was your question again?
[02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:10.067]  Uh, going through TSA, would you take your family
[02:19:14.792 --> 02:19:22.920]  No, because they've been known to drag people off to the police facility and kill them at the airport and in Phoenix and other areas.
[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:27.604]  And my children have never flown because of the genitalia groping.
[02:19:28.685 --> 02:19:35.907]  Uh, and, uh, once I was going through a border and they started grabbing on one of my daughters and I literally flipped out.
[02:19:35.907 --> 02:19:41.268]  So, I just cannot watch an obvious pedo-bear grab my children.
[02:19:41.268 --> 02:19:42.608]  Because I'm a terrorist!
[02:19:42.608 --> 02:19:45.169]  So the answer is no.
[02:19:45.169 --> 02:19:49.550]  I would have gotten mad in Nazi Germany if they pulled the train over instead of grabbing my daughters or my son's genitals.
[02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:51.090]  And that's because I'm a terrorist.
[02:19:51.090 --> 02:19:53.510]  If you don't support the Nazis, you're a racist terrorist.
[02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:55.671]  So I support all of Obama's Nazi policies.
[02:19:56.826 --> 02:19:58.772]  There, I've given some fairness to the broadcast.
[02:20:02.546 --> 02:20:10.269]  That's the sound of a .44 Magnum and TraumaMaxx, a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof vest from InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:20:10.269 --> 02:20:12.770]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.
[02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:19.593]  TraumaMaxx is a major breakthrough in pistol-rated body armor, and prices start at just $170 per insert.
[02:20:19.593 --> 02:20:24.815]  More protection, more stopping power, more mobility, and it weighs less than 5 pounds.

[02:20:27.476 --> 02:20:30.637]  That's I-N-F-I-D-E-L-BodyArmor.com.
[02:20:31.437 --> 02:20:32.818]  You know about RVs.
[02:20:32.818 --> 02:20:34.298]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:20:34.298 --> 02:20:37.039]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:20:37.039 --> 02:20:39.800]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:21:01.187 --> 02:21:04.848]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:21:04.848 --> 02:21:08.670]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:21:08.670 --> 02:21:14.852]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:21:14.852 --> 02:21:25.056]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:21:25.056 --> 02:21:29.578]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terragenics.

[02:22:57.494 --> 02:22:59.135]  Because there is a case for privacy.
[02:23:04.713 --> 02:23:09.775]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[02:23:09.775 --> 02:23:11.856]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[02:23:11.856 --> 02:23:14.077]  Police call it robbery.
[02:23:14.077 --> 02:23:15.958]  We call it avoidable.
[02:23:15.958 --> 02:23:22.000]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.402]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[02:23:27.402 --> 02:23:33.445]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[02:23:34.625 --> 02:23:41.671]  At only $29.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[02:23:41.671 --> 02:23:45.434]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to FakeTV.com.
[02:23:45.434 --> 02:23:47.015]  That's 877-532-5388 or FakeTV.com.
[02:23:47.015 --> 02:23:49.076]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:24:09.122 --> 02:24:10.664]  This just broke minutes ago.
[02:24:10.664 --> 02:24:20.692]  You know, the Justice Department has been looking at re-inguiding at a federal level because the state found him not guilty with a jury of his peers, George Zimmerman.
[02:24:20.692 --> 02:24:24.215]  And I always said that I didn't lionize George Zimmerman.
[02:24:24.215 --> 02:24:28.099]  I thought he was an idiot going out at night following somebody around with a gun.
[02:24:28.099 --> 02:24:32.543]  But the witnesses did say that Trayvon climbed on top of him and beat the daylights out of him.
[02:24:33.294 --> 02:24:36.515]  And I think I might get mad if somebody comes around the corner with a gun at me.
[02:24:36.515 --> 02:24:49.118]  I said it was a tragedy, but being used to create racial division by the White House as a political diversion from the horrible things Obama was doing with the wars, the corporate welfare, all of it.
[02:24:49.118 --> 02:24:53.959]  Well, now George Zimmerman has been arrested after a disturbance call.
[02:24:53.959 --> 02:24:55.339]  This just happened a few weeks ago.
[02:24:56.075 --> 02:25:08.565]  Former Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman was arrested Monday in Florida after deputies responded to a disturbance call at a house authority said Zimmerman will be transported and booked into jail.
[02:25:08.565 --> 02:25:11.287]  And we don't know the specifics of it yet so we'll try to follow it.
[02:25:11.287 --> 02:25:16.150]  Now that's a total diversion over all the serious news we've got.
[02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:18.452]  But it does show the type of people that don't need to be cops.
[02:25:18.452 --> 02:25:19.413]  George Zimmerman and others.
[02:25:20.811 --> 02:25:21.131]  We're
[02:25:40.442 --> 02:25:53.367]  And then the cops panic and start shooting into a vehicle, not the tires, into the vehicle that they know full well has little kids in it.
[02:25:53.367 --> 02:25:58.468]  And it's really creepy that this type of stuff's going on.
[02:25:58.468 --> 02:26:00.649]  And I call it the George Zimmerman Syndrome.
[02:26:00.649 --> 02:26:04.710]  But I don't lose my Second Amendment because people act like that.
[02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:08.992]  And by the way, statistically, look, that's why I said the jury did not have enough evidence to convict.
[02:26:10.017 --> 02:26:12.799]  Just like they let O.J.
[02:26:12.799 --> 02:26:14.159]  Simpson off.
[02:26:14.159 --> 02:26:14.459]  O.J.
[02:26:14.459 --> 02:26:15.540]  was obviously guilty.
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:16.381]  All the evidence pointed there.
[02:26:16.381 --> 02:26:19.682]  But you still had reasonable doubt.
[02:26:19.682 --> 02:26:22.164]  Reasonable doubt, because the cops got caught lying.
[02:26:22.164 --> 02:26:23.264]  Doesn't matter if he was guilty.
[02:26:23.264 --> 02:26:25.205]  They tried to frame him after the fact.
[02:26:25.205 --> 02:26:26.846]  With fake evidence, he's got to go free.
[02:26:26.846 --> 02:26:30.288]  Better than ten guilty men go free than one innocent man go to jail.
[02:26:30.288 --> 02:26:35.351]  That's English common law, American law, the best law in the world.
[02:26:35.351 --> 02:26:36.071]  You can say it.
[02:26:36.071 --> 02:26:36.512]  It's bad.
[02:26:36.512 --> 02:26:37.452]  It's not perfect.
[02:26:37.452 --> 02:26:38.573]  But it is the best system.
[02:26:39.748 --> 02:26:44.775]  We've got Saudi Arabia and Communist China now and others on the UN Human Rights Board.
[02:26:44.775 --> 02:26:46.096]  It's getting really bad.
[02:26:46.096 --> 02:26:50.602]  I'd have to tell you how bad China and Saudi Arabia are to human rights.
[02:26:50.602 --> 02:26:52.785]  Now, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:26:52.785 --> 02:26:55.769]  We're very thankful that he has been able to join us.
[02:26:56.707 --> 02:26:59.028]  He is Dr. Busby.
[02:26:59.028 --> 02:27:10.553]  Christopher Busby is a chemical physicist and British scientist known for his groundbreaking research on the health effects of cumulative low-level ionizing radiation.
[02:27:10.553 --> 02:27:19.277]  He advises the Parliament in England, the EU, and he broke a lot of news on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that turned out to be absolutely accurate.
[02:27:19.277 --> 02:27:19.898]  In fact, he's
[02:27:20.638 --> 02:27:23.539]  Very conservative compared to some of the alarmists that are out there.
[02:27:23.539 --> 02:27:31.680]  And he joins us now to give us a little breakdown on what's coming up in the next 18-minute segment.
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:41.862]  A new and a peer-reviewed Journal of Pediatrics report about increased problems in thyroid of babies, children and others on the West Coast.
[02:27:41.862 --> 02:27:48.264]  And of course we have all the reports of the rising radiation levels and governments raising what they say is cumulatively safe.
[02:27:49.384 --> 02:27:49.544]  Hello.
[02:28:07.543 --> 02:28:08.944]  Well, two things really.
[02:28:08.944 --> 02:28:12.766]  I think you wanted me to talk about the worst case scenario.
[02:28:12.766 --> 02:28:17.808]  You know, in other words, if the whole of Fukushima goes up with a big bang, what's going to happen?
[02:28:17.808 --> 02:28:18.609]  That's the first thing.
[02:28:18.609 --> 02:28:36.778]  And the second thing is I'll talk about the new study that we've done, which shows that there were effects from the tiny amounts of radiation that came to the United States from Fukushima, levels that were much lower than natural background radiation, but actually had a significant effect on babies who were born in California.
[02:28:37.858 --> 02:28:48.265]  So it just shows that all this stuff about natural background radiation as a yardstick for comparing the effects of ionizing radiation is just such a lot of nonsense.
[02:28:48.265 --> 02:28:55.931]  And that's because, sure, the background only goes up a little bit, but what happens if you get the concentrated particles that are radiating overall?
[02:28:55.931 --> 02:28:58.893]  It's kind of like a light bulb 100 yards away won't burn your hand.
[02:28:58.893 --> 02:29:00.474]  And they go, oh, that's background radiation.
[02:29:00.474 --> 02:29:03.236]  But when you grab it with your hand, it starts burning you.
[02:29:03.236 --> 02:29:04.657]  What happens if you breathe it or eat it?
[02:29:05.182 --> 02:29:06.443]  Well, that's kind of it, really.
[02:29:06.443 --> 02:29:11.565]  And particularly, of course, the babies in the womb are very, very sensitive.
[02:29:11.565 --> 02:29:22.651]  And there's been lots of research done recently that shows that millions of babies have died in the womb as a result of really quite low levels of internal radiation after these various accidents that have taken place.
[02:29:22.651 --> 02:29:31.116]  And, of course, after the weapons test fallout, which is the biggest injection of radioactivity into the world environment that's ever occurred.
[02:29:31.116 --> 02:29:32.837]  And I'll talk a little bit about that, too.
[02:29:33.237 --> 02:29:35.037]  Well, Dr. Busby, you'll have the floor.
[02:29:35.037 --> 02:29:36.818]  L-L-R-C dot O-R-G.
[02:29:36.818 --> 02:29:38.638]  Greenaudit dot O-R-G.
[02:29:38.638 --> 02:29:40.979]  A true environmentalist joining us.
[02:29:40.979 --> 02:29:45.099]  A true conservationist who actually wants humans to survive.
[02:29:45.099 --> 02:29:46.520]  Dr. Busby is our guest.
[02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:47.960]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:49.340]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:50.621]  InfoWars.com.
[02:29:50.621 --> 02:29:52.001]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.001 --> 02:29:54.541]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.541 --> 02:29:57.202]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.254 --> 02:30:11.938]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:30:11.938 --> 02:30:13.999]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:30:13.999 --> 02:30:14.880]  Fluoride!
[02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:16.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:23.103]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:30:23.363 --> 02:30:28.308]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:30:28.308 --> 02:30:34.615]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:30:34.615 --> 02:30:37.037]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:30:37.037 --> 02:30:39.980]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:43.344]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:30:43.464 --> 02:30:48.908]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:48.908 --> 02:30:54.012]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[02:30:54.012 --> 02:30:55.193]  I take it every day.

[02:31:01.761 --> 02:31:07.222]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:31:07.222 --> 02:31:16.124]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:31:16.124 --> 02:31:23.945]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:31:23.945 --> 02:31:31.327]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[02:31:31.847 --> 02:31:35.790]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[02:31:35.790 --> 02:31:39.993]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[02:31:39.993 --> 02:31:47.138]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[02:31:47.138 --> 02:31:54.343]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today, with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[02:31:54.343 --> 02:31:58.386]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[02:32:00.845 --> 02:32:04.328]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[02:32:04.328 --> 02:32:10.252]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:32:10.252 --> 02:32:16.856]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[02:32:16.856 --> 02:32:22.540]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:26.183]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[02:32:26.363 --> 02:32:30.165]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[02:32:30.165 --> 02:32:34.768]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[02:32:34.768 --> 02:32:37.269]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[02:32:37.269 --> 02:32:41.132]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[02:32:41.132 --> 02:32:45.554]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[02:32:45.554 --> 02:32:48.216]  This book is coffin nails to the gloveless takeover.
[02:32:48.516 --> 02:32:55.343]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[02:32:55.343 --> 02:33:03.110]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:05.813]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:05.813 --> 02:33:10.957]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:16.371 --> 02:33:21.392]  By the way, going to break, I said that Dr. Christopher Busby's a real environmentalist.
[02:33:21.392 --> 02:33:22.532]  They're destroying the earth.
[02:33:22.532 --> 02:33:24.713]  They're dumping toxic waste everywhere.
[02:33:24.713 --> 02:33:32.955]  Open-air genetic engineering that infects other families, not even plants, but animal, insect, you name it.
[02:33:32.955 --> 02:33:34.935]  It's all spreading.
[02:33:34.935 --> 02:33:40.737]  In every major study, the GMO is just wreaking havoc on the reproductive systems of the animals that eat it.
[02:33:42.689 --> 02:33:46.591]  91% of reactors, according to the UN, are leaking.
[02:33:46.591 --> 02:33:48.072]  They don't even care if they leak now.
[02:33:48.072 --> 02:33:51.495]  The troops are allowed to use DU in the last 20 years.
[02:33:51.495 --> 02:33:53.837]  Now they use it at regular shooting ranges.
[02:33:53.837 --> 02:33:56.579]  And then meanwhile, they've got this big corporate environmentalism.
[02:33:57.694 --> 02:34:12.569]  That only wants to tax people's houses or energy consumption and things that really, compared to all of the leaking radiation and the toxic waste and the genetic pollution, that really is screwing things up.
[02:34:12.569 --> 02:34:15.652]  I mean, the honeybees really are dying.
[02:34:15.652 --> 02:34:19.655]  Human cancers really are up multi-thousand percentage points in the West.
[02:34:19.655 --> 02:34:20.696]  I mean, this is all real.
[02:34:21.744 --> 02:34:27.971]  And if they came out, I mean, when the government came out and said, OK, we're going to ban BPA for babies, I was like, yes, ban it.
[02:34:27.971 --> 02:34:37.340]  It's like real stuff, real things, instead of diverting into certain corporations like General Electric being exempt from their plants being shut down.
[02:34:38.581 --> 02:34:45.086]  Or they go build plants in Mexico and then shut down clean plants in Texas and then run dirty coal into the air.
[02:34:45.086 --> 02:34:48.509]  Folks, these corporations have used the environmental movement to take over.
[02:34:48.509 --> 02:34:59.318]  And then I see all the fake left, from George Monbiot to you name it, promoting nuclear now, when I was somebody growing up bought into nuclear power propaganda.
[02:35:00.089 --> 02:35:01.491]  Bought into all of it.
[02:35:01.491 --> 02:35:03.453]  And back then it looked like it was managed a little bit better.
[02:35:03.453 --> 02:35:05.776]  Maybe we're just more informed now.
[02:35:05.776 --> 02:35:07.619]  And all the nuclear disasters they've covered up.
[02:35:07.619 --> 02:35:08.760]  So now I see it as...
[02:35:10.023 --> 02:35:11.784]  Is there any form of safe nuclear power?
[02:35:11.784 --> 02:35:18.325]  That's a question I'm going to ask Dr. Busby at the end of the interview in about 25 minutes, but I want to give him the floor now, because they're going to remove the fuel rods.
[02:35:18.325 --> 02:35:19.306]  That's started.
[02:35:19.306 --> 02:35:21.646]  They're saying that could trigger a disaster.
[02:35:21.646 --> 02:35:28.568]  We've got cover-ups of the yellowfin tuna having higher levels of radiation.
[02:35:28.568 --> 02:35:33.170]  We've got this new study that he helped author that's in the peer-reviewed Journal of Pediatrics.
[02:35:34.370 --> 02:35:38.112]  Where you can read it on his site LLRC.org.
[02:35:38.112 --> 02:35:40.734]  We're going to link it up on InfoWars.com.
[02:35:40.734 --> 02:35:51.820]  Changes in confirmed plus borderline cases of congenital hyperthyroidism in California as a function of environmental fallout from the Fukushima nuclear meltdown.
[02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:59.845]  So he joins us right now to talk about worst case scenarios, what's currently happening there with the ground sinking.
[02:35:59.845 --> 02:36:00.605]  You've got the floor.
[02:36:00.605 --> 02:36:02.106]  Give us a presentation Dr. Busby.
[02:36:02.642 --> 02:36:10.530]  Well, let me start then with the congenital hyperthyroidism paper.
[02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:18.618]  Because the important thing about that is, in a way, it introduces us to the main problem in all of this.
[02:36:18.618 --> 02:36:26.145]  Because what we did, this was my colleagues Joe Mangano and Jeanette Sherman of the Radiation and Public Health Project in New York.
[02:36:27.666 --> 02:36:42.194]  And I. We studied the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone that are measured in blood samples taken at birth in the state of California over the period of the Fukushima catastrophe.
[02:36:42.794 --> 02:36:58.103]  Now, you all know that a small amount of radioiodine, and it was a very small amount of radioiodine, by the time it got across the 5,000 miles from Fukushima to California, to the west coast of the United States, the concentrations were really quite small.
[02:36:58.783 --> 02:37:04.568]  But nobody should be complacent because they were such small concentrations.
[02:37:04.568 --> 02:37:24.945]  What happened at the time, of course, is that there was a lot of yelling and screaming about the fact that there was radioactive iodine-131 measured in the milk, and the engineering department at the University of Berkeley measured, I think, between 5 and 10 becquerels per litre of radioiodine-131 in rainwater.
[02:37:26.519 --> 02:37:32.024]  Now, from that, it's fairly easy to work out roughly what the dose would be.
[02:37:32.024 --> 02:37:40.972]  Iodine-131 has quite a short half-life, about 8 days, and so really this event only occurred over a period of about 10 or 15 days.
[02:37:40.972 --> 02:37:45.936]  So you can work out what the dose is to adults, assuming that they just drank rainwater.
[02:37:45.936 --> 02:37:48.078]  Well, of course, people don't drink rainwater, do they?
[02:37:48.078 --> 02:37:49.960]  They drink water from the tap or from bottles.
[02:37:50.941 --> 02:37:55.706]  But anyway, let's take the worst case and say that they were only drinking rainwater.
[02:37:55.706 --> 02:38:02.234]  The dose that they would have got is about one hundredth of natural background radiation.
[02:38:02.234 --> 02:38:04.057]  The annual dose of natural background radiation.
[02:38:04.057 --> 02:38:06.279]  So in other words, it's a very, very, very small dose.
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:11.843]  And by the time that it got down to the baby, it would have been even smaller.
[02:38:11.843 --> 02:38:25.994]  And yet, what we discovered was that there was a highly statistically significant increase in confirmed congenital hypothyroid cases in babies in California and in borderline cases, about 27%.
[02:38:27.415 --> 02:38:28.718]  No, it may not sound very much.
[02:38:28.718 --> 02:38:33.229]  It's about 400 babies and, you know, it's not a good thing that that happened.
[02:38:33.229 --> 02:38:37.118]  But the most important thing in all of this, in this paper, is that once again...
[02:38:38.180 --> 02:38:59.122]  We see that the concept of dose is not valid for the measurement, for the quantification, for the understanding of the health effects of internal radionuclides like radioiodine and like these particles that you were talking about, which give a lot of dose to one little piece of the body and no dose at all to the rest.
[02:38:59.762 --> 02:39:06.164]  So this concept, again and again, we see that this concept of absorbed dose is not valid.
[02:39:06.164 --> 02:39:27.310]  Whenever we see in the news that there's been an accident or that there's been some release of radioactivity somewhere, then what happens is the nuclear industry or the scientists from the government, and this is awful too because it's very few real scientists left anyway, these scientists, we'll put that in inverted commas, scientists,
[02:39:28.030 --> 02:39:33.131]  Come out and they say, oh well the dose is too low for it to cause you any harm.
[02:39:33.131 --> 02:39:50.675]  This is what they scream at any argument that says that we're being irradiated by all these substances which first appeared on the planet in the 1950s with the weapons fallout and then increasingly were produced by nuclear power stations and accidents and so forth.
[02:39:50.675 --> 02:39:54.176]  Not forgetting the depleted uranium that we're talking about.
[02:39:54.176 --> 02:39:57.297]  So the one message that we take home from this study
[02:39:58.797 --> 02:40:01.498]  Is that the concept of dose is invalid.
[02:40:01.498 --> 02:40:09.860]  And also the other thing that we went to at the end of this study was the increases in thyroid cancer which have been detected now in Fukushima.
[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:18.102]  So only three years after the accident we see a rapid increase in thyroid cancer in children aged 0 to 18.
[02:40:18.102 --> 02:40:22.683]  And I did a calculation on this which enables me to work out what the relative risk is.
[02:40:22.683 --> 02:40:28.184]  You know that the percentage is higher than what you would expect if there had been no event.
[02:40:28.764 --> 02:40:35.345]  And we get an 80-fold excess, so there's an 80 times the numbers of thyroid cancers that you would expect normally.
[02:40:35.345 --> 02:40:37.106]  This is an enormous number!
[02:40:37.106 --> 02:40:52.508]  But of course what's happening there is that these same scientists, these tame scientists that work for the government, or even in fact the scientists who measured these thyroid cancers, who detected them in the screening, they say, well it can't be from Fukushima because the dose is too small.
[02:40:52.508 --> 02:40:56.249]  So we live in a sort of Alice in Wonderland world, or sort of like an airbrushed world.
[02:40:56.929 --> 02:41:05.413]  Which is much worse than the original Soviet Union way in which, you know, things were covered up, because at the moment it's covered up in such a way that it's utterly bizarre!
[02:41:05.413 --> 02:41:10.215]  Anyway, so that's the message from the paper that we've just published.
[02:41:10.215 --> 02:41:17.398]  And let me just briefly tell listeners that physicist, chemical physicist Christopher Busby joins us, and I want to back up what he's saying.
[02:41:17.398 --> 02:41:19.899]  I'm not a chemical physicist or a nuclear physicist.
[02:41:19.899 --> 02:41:24.401]  Who is a chemical physicist, as well as a nuclear physicist, is
[02:41:26.102 --> 02:41:37.992]  Dr. Doug Rockey, who was the head of the entire Pentagon GU program in the 80s and 90s, who wrote the book on it, and did the removal of the waste in Kuwait and Iraq.
[02:41:37.992 --> 02:41:40.414]  Most of his team has died.
[02:41:40.414 --> 02:41:43.657]  Long before I even ever interviewed Dr. Busby, he would come on 10 years ago plus.
[02:41:43.657 --> 02:41:45.919]  He's had over 50 surgeries just to survive.
[02:41:45.919 --> 02:41:48.121]  More surgeries than probably Darth Vader had, fictionally.
[02:41:48.821 --> 02:41:53.342]  And when he explains it, he goes, it's asinine saying we could use DU.
[02:41:53.342 --> 02:42:05.486]  They wouldn't let us use it until 1990 because all the physicists, even going back to the 50s, said if you ingest it in your lungs or your kidneys, it goes into the cell at point blank range and fries them.
[02:42:05.486 --> 02:42:07.727]  And they use the analogy basically of the light bulb.
[02:42:08.027 --> 02:42:10.369]  A lightbulb off at 100 yards doesn't burn you.
[02:42:10.369 --> 02:42:13.030]  If you go up and grab it, it will cook your hand.
[02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:14.972]  And that's basically what's happening.
[02:42:14.972 --> 02:42:21.596]  And then they've had other physicists that I've interviewed and other people have explained this over and over again.
[02:42:21.596 --> 02:42:24.117]  And so the system knows full well what they're doing.
[02:42:24.117 --> 02:42:30.962]  Because previous to really the 1990s, there was an argument saying it's bad, it's good, it's okay.
[02:42:30.962 --> 02:42:32.343]  Now they just don't seem to care.
[02:42:32.343 --> 02:42:33.964]  So let me ask you this and then get into the rest of it.
[02:42:35.037 --> 02:42:41.999]  Why doesn't the power structure seem to care anymore that they're living in increased radioactive poison?
[02:42:41.999 --> 02:42:43.200]  Well, this is a very good question.
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:44.640]  I don't really have an answer for it.
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:52.143]  I mean, because to me, and to you, and to any sensible person thinking about it, of course, what they're doing is that they're...
[02:42:53.647 --> 02:42:57.913]  They're destroying themselves and their children and all their relatives.
[02:42:57.913 --> 02:43:01.559]  And one has to ask, how is it possible that they can do this?
[02:43:01.559 --> 02:43:07.628]  I mean, some of them are physicists, and I have to say, physicists seem to have the ability to deal in a sort of world of abstract mathematics.
[02:43:08.729 --> 02:43:15.634]  And I think I particularly single out physicists for the ability to believe something which is totally impossible.
[02:43:15.634 --> 02:43:17.656]  And a lot of modern physics is like that.
[02:43:17.656 --> 02:43:23.781]  And you will find in governments that the scientific advisors to governments are very often particle physicists.
[02:43:24.341 --> 02:43:40.915]  And I think this goes back to the school days, where, you know, if you were a physicist or a mathematician, you were assumed to be cleverer than somebody who wasn't, who was a chemist, and then it goes down to biologists, and after that it sort of goes down to geographers, and then people who read English and history, and so on, all the way down to the bottom.
[02:43:42.076 --> 02:43:57.603]  And so the problem is that these people have got the idea that because they can do mathematics and they can create these wondrous worlds of equations, including the world of the equations that describe absorbed dose, of course, exactly that, they don't need to know about biology.
[02:43:58.183 --> 02:44:01.244]  In fact, I've talked to them and they said, well, I don't know about biology.
[02:44:01.244 --> 02:44:04.646]  If I need to know about biology, I'll ask a biologist.
[02:44:04.646 --> 02:44:11.869]  And of course, if a biologist comes along saying, I'm sorry, mate, but everybody's dying because you've got it wrong, they will just say, oh, you're not a physicist.
[02:44:11.869 --> 02:44:12.909]  And it goes on like that.
[02:44:12.909 --> 02:44:14.470]  So that's one part of the equation.
[02:44:14.470 --> 02:44:18.992]  The other part, of course, is that there are some genuinely evil people out there, in my opinion.
[02:44:19.835 --> 02:44:20.976]  I mean, I've met some of them.
[02:44:20.976 --> 02:44:32.423]  There are people who are up there for their own reasons, you know, because they make money or because they have a high position and because, as Proudhon the anarchist once said, if you put a man in uniform he becomes a monster.
[02:44:33.303 --> 02:44:34.884]  And I think there are people like that.
[02:44:34.884 --> 02:44:36.485]  I mean, I can give you examples.
[02:44:36.485 --> 02:44:45.230]  One good example is the ex-head of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, who is now the head of the medical system.
[02:44:45.230 --> 02:44:49.292]  He's the head of the social security system in Sweden, a man called Lars-Erik Holm.
[02:44:49.292 --> 02:44:56.417]  I mean, he is very much, you know, I think in my opinion he is individually responsible for the deaths of several million people.
[02:44:57.737 --> 02:45:15.525]  You know, we talk about Hitler and we talk about Saddam Hussein and all these people who are like monsters, you know, within the concept of the historical description of monsters, but actually a lot of these physicists who continue to underpin this ridiculous system of absorbed dose are responsible for a lot more deaths than Hitler.
[02:45:17.062 --> 02:45:39.665]  It's really incredible, but the way that Dr. Rocky and others that we've interviewed, former head of the Star Wars program, nuclear physicist, engineer, chemical physicist, Dr. Bob Bowman, just out a few months ago, he said, look, of course, if people get hot particles, they'll be the ones in the Russian roulette that, you know, died ten years after, hypothetically.
[02:45:39.665 --> 02:45:40.246]  He said, look at
[02:45:40.686 --> 02:45:42.668]  Look at what happened with Chernobyl.
[02:45:42.668 --> 02:45:49.213]  We have metrics we can break down that the UN says around a million plus people died from cancers as an effect of that.
[02:45:49.213 --> 02:45:55.618]  And they took measures to not drink the milk from Europe for a few years, to not eat the vegetables in those areas, to import them.
[02:45:55.618 --> 02:45:58.641]  Now they don't even try to mitigate anything.
[02:45:58.641 --> 02:46:00.222]  They just say it's fine.
[02:46:00.222 --> 02:46:06.528]  Don't even tell people the tuna is radioactive, that the milks had this problem, or surface vegetables like spinach and things.
[02:46:07.423 --> 02:46:09.327]  But he was a physicist.
[02:46:09.327 --> 02:46:09.908]  He described it.
[02:46:09.908 --> 02:46:10.228]  He knew.
[02:46:10.228 --> 02:46:12.552]  And that's how Dr. Rockey describes it.
[02:46:12.552 --> 02:46:16.760]  He says, look, prior to 1990, no one would use this.
[02:46:17.679 --> 02:46:19.240]  But then they just said, don't worry about it.
[02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:21.681]  And then they would at least try to wear masks and gloves.
[02:46:21.681 --> 02:46:24.602]  Now they don't wear masks and gloves when they use DU.
[02:46:24.602 --> 02:46:34.106]  I mean, it really just shows a mass delusion, a hyper nihilistic, I don't even know what you call it, but I don't want to waste any more time on that, Dr. Busby.
[02:46:34.106 --> 02:46:41.889]  Get into the removal of the rods, the sinking, I know it has a scientific name, into a sinkhole of the Fukushima situation.
[02:46:42.750 --> 02:46:53.745]  We've seen other physicists, you know, the fellow from Canada, you know, came out and kind of did a gestalt saying that if it does melt down, it could, you know, really threaten humanity.
[02:46:53.745 --> 02:46:56.910]  Goodbye, Japan, I think was the quote from Suzuki.
[02:46:56.910 --> 02:46:58.272]  What is the worst case scenario?
[02:46:58.772 --> 02:46:59.373]  Okay, right.
[02:46:59.373 --> 02:47:00.214]  Well, I'll go to that.
[02:47:00.214 --> 02:47:15.068]  Before I do, let me just say that there is a bit of news on the DU front, which is that increasingly I'm being contacted by Gulf War veterans in the United Kingdom who are now aged about 40, and there's a massive increase in cancer amongst those people.
[02:47:15.068 --> 02:47:18.311]  So, I mean, just by the way, that's now feeding through into the system.
[02:47:18.311 --> 02:47:21.454]  Because, of course, as you say, it takes several years, 10, 15 years before
[02:47:23.195 --> 02:47:28.500]  These particles create sufficient dose to the local tissue to develop cancer.
[02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:33.824]  Well now those years have passed and we're beginning to see the beginning of an epidemic there.
[02:47:33.824 --> 02:47:37.467]  Anyway, so over to Fukushima, right.
[02:47:37.467 --> 02:47:43.713]  Well I have seen on the internet and people have contacted me with
[02:47:45.994 --> 02:47:51.077]  Amazing, doom-laden sort of prospects if the whole lot goes up.
[02:47:51.077 --> 02:47:55.359]  And people have been asking me more and more to sort of get in there and have a look at it all.
[02:47:55.359 --> 02:48:02.182]  It is actually quite complicated and you've got to do lots and lots of sums and get all the numbers from all over the place, work it all out.
[02:48:02.182 --> 02:48:06.784]  You know, I've been working on this off and on for about six weeks and eventually I figured it all out.
[02:48:06.784 --> 02:48:09.445]  So now I'm going to present you with the answer.
[02:48:09.445 --> 02:48:14.467]  And the answer is this, that it's not the end of the world and it's, you know, by no means is it the end of the world.
[02:48:14.467 --> 02:48:14.667]  Although
[02:48:14.787 --> 02:48:18.930]  It probably is the end of Japan, so that's the headline.
[02:48:18.930 --> 02:48:34.960]  If the thing goes up, and what I mean now, in my worst case scenario, like the worst thing that could possibly happen is this, that the reactor 4 tank collapses in some way.
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:40.143]  Either it explodes because they stick two rods too close together and there's an explosion which drives out all the
[02:48:40.703 --> 02:48:53.149]  Water and then you know that once the water's gone it all melts down and then and then of course it distills off the plutonium and then there's a critical mass and there's an enormous bang so you get a fission explosion.
[02:48:53.149 --> 02:48:58.812]  The alternative is that the thing is sitting as you said in a sort of swamp now and leaning
[02:48:59.412 --> 02:49:07.738]  And of course they know this too, so that's why they're rapidly pulling all the spent fuel out of that number four tank.
[02:49:07.738 --> 02:49:20.288]  So if that collapsed, if it actually fell over, then of course the water would all slosh out of the tank, there would be no cooling for half of the tank, and then of course it would melt down, the heat would increase, it would boil off the water.
[02:49:20.888 --> 02:49:23.550]  Distill the plutonium and bang.
[02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:27.033]  And then of course the third possibility is we have another typhoon.
[02:49:27.033 --> 02:49:31.216]  So all of these things are possible ways in which we can get a large bang.
[02:49:31.216 --> 02:49:40.983]  Now let's assume the bang is big enough to also destroy the cooling to the other reactors, buildings, pressure vessels.
[02:49:41.519 --> 02:49:47.063]  So let's imagine that the whole lot goes up in some kind of massive, dirty fission bomb.
[02:49:47.063 --> 02:49:52.027]  Now, we have to note here that if it does explode, it will be a fission bomb.
[02:49:52.027 --> 02:49:55.369]  It's not going to be a hydrogen bomb, there's going to be no megaton explosions.
[02:49:55.369 --> 02:50:00.333]  The worst that can happen is that there's going to be some massive fission event.
[02:50:00.333 --> 02:50:06.418]  Now, if that happens, we know, as a result of various studies that have been done, exactly what's in there.
[02:50:06.418 --> 02:50:09.520]  Well, not exactly, but pretty much what's in there.
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:10.741]  And we can add it all together.
[02:50:12.313 --> 02:50:19.758]  And then we can compare it in terms of releases to all of the other events that people compare it to, and I've done that.
[02:50:19.758 --> 02:50:26.302]  So, I mean, I can give you lots and lots of numbers, but basically those numbers wouldn't really mean anything.
[02:50:26.302 --> 02:50:32.505]  So what I've done is I've compared it in terms of two of the main radio nuclides.
[02:50:32.505 --> 02:50:32.846]  These are the
[02:50:33.806 --> 02:50:46.493]  The most dangerous ones and the ones that are usually used to assess any event, any of these, you know, exposure events.
[02:50:46.493 --> 02:50:57.898]  I've compared the Strontium-90 and Caesium-137 with the Hiroshima bomb, because that's one that everybody does, and with the Fukushima that's already happened, that's like, if you like to call it Fukushima 1,
[02:50:59.252 --> 02:51:08.154]  And then with Chernobyl in 1986, and then of course, and this is the big one, with the atmospheric nuclear testing, 1952 to 1980.
[02:51:08.154 --> 02:51:15.356]  Because what I conclude in all of this, and I think I've said it before, is that actually, even if everything went up from Fukushima,
[02:51:17.677 --> 02:51:27.986]  It would still not be as much as the injection into the world environment, the global environment, from the combined atmospheric nuclear tests between 1952 and 1980.
[02:51:27.986 --> 02:51:30.148]  It comes to about 60% of them.
[02:51:30.148 --> 02:51:35.894]  So if we take all of the radionuclides that came out in the atom bombs and the explosions that occurred in
[02:51:37.119 --> 02:51:52.698]  In the Marshall Islands, the United States Marshall Islands tests, and then of course the British tests at Christmas Island, and the French tests at Muroroa and in North Africa, and then of course the enormously big Russian tests in Kazakhstan, the Tsar Bomba, which is 40 megatons.
[02:51:53.419 --> 02:52:21.314]  These tests blew an enormous amount of radioactivity up into the stratosphere, where it came pitter-patter, pitter-patter down after about 1959 through to 1964, and the strontium-90 built up in everybody's bones, and the iodine went everywhere, and the tritium increased, and carbon-14 increased, and Sakharov and Pauling both said that this would cause enormous increases in cancer, which of course it has done.
[02:52:23.192 --> 02:52:30.994]  And so compared to that, if the whole of Fukushima goes up, it will only be about the same as that, actually less, about half of it, 60%.
[02:52:30.994 --> 02:52:37.235]  So the total contents of the Fukushima is about 60% of the total releases from the atmospheric tests.
[02:52:37.235 --> 02:52:44.677]  But actually it'll be a lot less than that, and the reason is that the atmospheric tests blew all this stuff into the global environment with their enormous power.
[02:52:46.427 --> 02:52:50.391]  But this will be like a fairly local fission bomb.
[02:52:50.391 --> 02:52:58.718]  And so it will cause massive contamination of the local Pacific, and catastrophic contamination of northern Japan, of course.
[02:52:58.718 --> 02:53:14.771]  I mean, I worked out that the mean concentration in the whole of northern Japan would be about 16 megabecherels per square meter, which would give you a dose of about, what have I got here, a dose rate of 50 microsieverts per hour, which is like... But Ann Coulter says that's good for you.
[02:53:15.792 --> 02:53:20.134]  Ah, yes, well he should go there if it happens there.
[02:53:20.134 --> 02:53:20.894]  He should!
[02:53:20.894 --> 02:53:22.454]  Go ahead.
[02:53:22.454 --> 02:53:31.197]  Yes, well I mean of course all that stuff is nonsense, although there is, to be honest with you, there is a certain element of truth in this whole Mises idea, you know.
[02:53:31.197 --> 02:53:38.800]  If you do give mice a little bit of external radiation, and I have to say it's external radiation that they're talking about,
[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:48.763]  Then what it does is over a period of time it beefs up the repair systems in the cells slightly and that can be shown.
[02:53:48.763 --> 02:53:56.846]  But of course the problem with internal radiation is it doesn't give a very small increase in dose to the cell, it gives an enormous increase in dose to the cell.
[02:53:56.846 --> 02:54:01.608]  I mean one alpha particle from, well to put this in perspective, if you take
[02:54:02.888 --> 02:54:14.231]  If you take natural background radiation, which everyone uses as a yardstick, we'll say that 2 millisieverts, to go to this dose argument, is the annual dose to a cell, 2 millisieverts.
[02:54:14.231 --> 02:54:18.673]  But if you get a single alpha particle track from a uranium particle to a cell, it's 500 millisieverts.
[02:54:20.333 --> 02:54:26.277]  And if it's actually a particle sitting there, not moving anywhere, it's going to be banging away with more and more and more of these.
[02:54:26.277 --> 02:54:33.241]  It's going to be like the first one is 500 millisieverts, then it'll get another one, so that's 1000 millisieverts, and so on.
[02:54:33.241 --> 02:54:41.146]  So, for internal radiation, like, you know, your argument about the light bulb, the levels of actual dose to the cell are enormously high.
[02:54:41.146 --> 02:54:45.989]  They're very, very much higher than these levels of natural background radiation we're talking about.
[02:54:45.989 --> 02:54:49.531]  It's the light bulb effect that you're talking about which is actually the problem.
[02:54:50.380 --> 02:55:11.083]  And also, in terms of uranium, of course, it binds to DNA, so not only is it banging the alpha particle into the cell, but because it has an extraordinarily high chemical affinity for DNA... I was about to say, that's what Dr. Rocky said in the Pentagon study, some of it secret, a lot of it public, he said it's not just the radiation, he said, chemically, it's an incredible poison.
[02:55:12.042 --> 02:55:13.042]  That's right, it is.
[02:55:13.042 --> 02:55:13.362]  It is.
[02:55:13.362 --> 02:55:14.483]  I mean, nobody knows quite why.
[02:55:14.483 --> 02:55:19.565]  I mean, well, at least... What Rocky is saying is that it's a chemical poison.
[02:55:19.565 --> 02:55:22.306]  My own feeling is it's not a chemical poison.
[02:55:22.306 --> 02:55:24.046]  It's a chemical radioactive poison.
[02:55:24.046 --> 02:55:28.248]  So, in other words, it combines its chemistry, its chemical affinity for DNA.
[02:55:29.328 --> 02:55:32.712]  Sure, sure, he's just saying it's incredibly toxic in his words.
[02:55:32.712 --> 02:55:34.895]  Yes, yes, well of course it is, of course it is.
[02:55:34.895 --> 02:55:43.484]  I mean, the work that we've done in Fallujah has shown the highest levels of cancer that have ever been reported in any study anywhere.
[02:55:43.985 --> 02:55:50.869]  I mean the levels of leukemia that we were finding in Fallujah were like 38 times the expected number based on the background.
[02:55:50.869 --> 02:55:56.852]  I was about to say, even like 6-7 years ago right after Fallujah, within a year they were talking about birth defects.
[02:55:56.852 --> 02:56:00.114]  I think the headline was 16 times the previous record.
[02:56:00.834 --> 02:56:02.714]  That's right, that's right.
[02:56:02.714 --> 02:56:08.656]  It's an absolute genetic damage catastrophe in Fallujah and nobody's doing anything about it.
[02:56:08.656 --> 02:56:16.978]  What happened was that the World Health Organization produced some utterly bogus study which actually showed that there were no effects there at all.
[02:56:16.978 --> 02:56:23.979]  Which I've attacked roundly in various arguments in various media reports.
[02:56:23.979 --> 02:56:25.080]  It's quite extraordinary.
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:30.101]  Don't the people putting out the bull know that their bull won't protect them from radiation?
[02:56:31.718 --> 02:56:35.041]  Well, we're back to that argument again, aren't we?
[02:56:35.041 --> 02:56:44.950]  I suppose, you know, and the trouble is if you're an ordinary human being like you and me, I mean, I think maybe we are sort of a little bit more ordinary than these people that are allowing this to go on anyway.
[02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:46.512]  You just can't understand it.
[02:56:46.512 --> 02:56:52.317]  What happens is you just, your mouth just drops open and you think, well, how is it and why is it that they continue to do this?
[02:56:52.317 --> 02:56:55.180]  Well, I mean, like I said, some of them are not very nice people.
[02:56:55.680 --> 02:57:02.623]  And some of them do it because they obtain power out of it and they'd rather have power than find about their children dying of leukemia.
[02:57:02.623 --> 02:57:07.725]  But the other ones that go along with it, like sheep, goodness only knows why they do that.
[02:57:07.725 --> 02:57:08.905]  They're just so domesticated.
[02:57:08.905 --> 02:57:09.946]  Shifting gears though.
[02:57:11.627 --> 02:57:23.614]  Just the argument against nuclear power now, when you look at the response in Fukushima, or you look at how they respond here in Southern California when the alarm goes off, now they've just permanently turned the alarms off.
[02:57:23.614 --> 02:57:30.958]  It just shows government at this stage with its management cannot be trusted with corporations to run nuclear power.
[02:57:30.958 --> 02:57:37.262]  Well, I remember that John Goffman said that the nuclear industry is waging a war against humanity.
[02:57:37.810 --> 02:57:39.932]  But I would now put it further than that.
[02:57:39.932 --> 02:57:43.855]  I would say that global science is waging a war against humanity.
[02:57:43.855 --> 02:57:46.156]  I mean, like you said before, it's not just nuclear.
[02:57:46.156 --> 02:57:56.444]  It's in every single area where scientific developments can be used to make money for the monster that has now become global capitalism.
[02:57:56.444 --> 02:58:06.892]  People just turn a complete blind eye to any effects on human life and just march on steadily with the production of substances which they release to the environment, which kill people.
[02:58:07.572 --> 02:58:09.312]  Sounds like the legend of Atlantis.
[02:58:09.312 --> 02:58:13.993]  Whether it was true or not, they created some technology that blew up their island.
[02:58:13.993 --> 02:58:14.553]  Yes.
[02:58:14.553 --> 02:58:16.114]  Well, it does look like we're doing that.
[02:58:16.114 --> 02:58:17.394]  Doctor, let me do five more minutes.
[02:58:17.394 --> 02:58:17.994]  I know you've got to go.
[02:58:17.994 --> 02:58:18.774]  We're going to do some overdrive.
[02:58:18.774 --> 02:58:21.615]  I want you to have closing comments and talk about what we do.
[02:58:21.615 --> 02:58:24.956]  Is there any safe atomic or nuclear power?
[02:58:24.956 --> 02:58:29.557]  What do we do with all these 35, 40-year-old aging things everywhere leaking?
[02:58:29.557 --> 02:58:30.597]  And what do we do?
[02:58:30.597 --> 02:58:31.497]  Because I've got children.
[02:58:32.657 --> 02:58:33.999]  I don't want to die cancer young.
[02:58:33.999 --> 02:58:34.960]  I don't want to die period.
[02:58:34.960 --> 02:58:35.761]  This is really scary.
[02:58:35.761 --> 02:58:38.744]  We're going to be back in 60 seconds with Dr. Busby.
[02:58:38.744 --> 02:58:42.969]  Stay with us.
[02:58:42.969 --> 02:58:46.493]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.493 --> 02:58:48.595]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.992 --> 02:58:53.053]  I had tried everything.
[02:58:53.053 --> 02:58:55.414]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:58:55.414 --> 02:58:58.536]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:58:58.536 --> 02:59:03.359]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:59:03.359 --> 02:59:09.743]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:59:10.223 --> 02:59:21.450]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:59:21.450 --> 02:59:25.913]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:59:25.913 --> 02:59:32.177]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:59:32.177 --> 02:59:33.318]  Now that's results!
[02:59:33.738 --> 02:59:46.247]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[02:59:53.872 --> 02:59:55.933]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.933 --> 02:59:59.155]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.158 --> 03:00:11.002]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:11.002 --> 03:00:12.583]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.583 --> 03:00:14.145]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.145 --> 03:00:18.328]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.328 --> 03:00:24.994]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.994 --> 03:00:29.478]  Alright, final segment with Dr. Busby.
[03:00:31.007 --> 03:00:43.778]  I'm going to continue on with some overdrive for the next segment and go to Julio Lissing on 1530 AM in Chicago, Ramon and Tanner and Rose and Mercedes and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[03:00:43.778 --> 03:00:46.621]  Dr. Busby, we've only got about four or five minutes in this short segment.
[03:00:46.621 --> 03:00:52.546]  Folks can go see your studies and the other mainline studies you're linked to at llrc.org, greenaudit.org.
[03:00:53.875 --> 03:00:57.241]  And hopefully find out about what's happening.
[03:00:57.241 --> 03:00:58.783]  But you heard my question.
[03:00:58.783 --> 03:01:02.029]  Is there any form of safe atomic or nuclear power?
[03:01:02.964 --> 03:01:04.405]  No, there isn't.
[03:01:04.405 --> 03:01:07.007]  It's not possible to constrain the atom.
[03:01:07.007 --> 03:01:15.752]  It's not possible to do anything with the atom that is safe enough, that prevents releases of these radionuclides.
[03:01:15.752 --> 03:01:22.036]  And all of these radionuclides have significant harmful effects at very, very low concentrations.
[03:01:22.036 --> 03:01:24.717]  So the answer is no, you can't do that.
[03:01:24.717 --> 03:01:30.341]  And I should say one thing in the little time I've got left, is that in terms of Fukushima, people in the United States
[03:01:31.061 --> 03:01:33.342]  Their attention is in the wrong places.
[03:01:33.342 --> 03:01:39.286]  They're concerned about the concentrations of radionuclides in Pacific tuna, which are very, very low, really.
[03:01:39.286 --> 03:01:48.032]  Much lower than the levels, for instance, in Europe, in herring in the Baltic Sea, which is... We have levels of 50 becquerels per kilogram in herring in the Baltic Sea.
[03:01:48.032 --> 03:01:48.152]  So...
[03:01:49.693 --> 03:01:57.117]  Earlier I reassured everybody about what would happen if... I mean, well, not people in Japan, but people in the United States, if it all went up.
[03:01:57.117 --> 03:02:03.181]  But the people in the United States have their own problems, and the dangers there are much greater from the local nuclear sites.
[03:02:03.181 --> 03:02:06.563]  I was about to say, now whenever they have a leak or a problem, they don't even tell you!
[03:02:07.341 --> 03:02:08.762]  No, that's right.
[03:02:08.762 --> 03:02:17.569]  And so if you're worried about radioactivity and fish, you want to worry about the fish that swim in the river, which is fed water by the nuclear reactor near you.
[03:02:17.569 --> 03:02:23.994]  Because a map that I've seen of the United States with nuclear reactors is like somebody's thrown a lot of darts at it.
[03:02:23.994 --> 03:02:32.500]  There are an awful lot of nuclear reactors, and they're all very old, and they're all falling to pieces, and they're all leaking like sieves, and it's all going into the ground, and it's all going into your food and your
[03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:39.565]  Sure, what about the number that I see of 91% CBS News says 75% of reactors are leaking.
[03:02:39.565 --> 03:02:41.587]  What's the real number from your research?
[03:02:41.587 --> 03:02:44.489]  I would think 100% is the number that are leaking.
[03:02:44.489 --> 03:02:49.192]  It's absolutely not possible to function with a nuclear power station without it leaking.
[03:02:49.192 --> 03:02:49.712]  Can't be done.
[03:02:49.712 --> 03:02:53.415]  That's what I was told by Captain Don Darling, who's the head of Veterans for Peace here in Austin.
[03:02:53.415 --> 03:02:57.818]  He was on nuclear submarines as a captain and then ran the famous super submersible
[03:02:59.159 --> 03:03:00.460]  Rescue subs.
[03:03:00.460 --> 03:03:02.201]  And he said they're all a bunch of liars.
[03:03:02.201 --> 03:03:07.363]  He said they would have them do tests where they turn the reactor on and off, frying everyone on board.
[03:03:07.363 --> 03:03:08.824]  He's had incredible health problems.
[03:03:08.824 --> 03:03:11.065]  I mean, he just concurs with what you're saying.
[03:03:11.065 --> 03:03:15.147]  Of course, the problem is that, you know, it's like being stabbed and then you die 10 years later.
[03:03:15.147 --> 03:03:19.789]  So it's very difficult for you to actually take any case on this or actually do anything about it.
[03:03:19.789 --> 03:03:20.930]  And the stuff is invisible.
[03:03:20.930 --> 03:03:24.352]  So unless you have all sorts of radiation measuring equipment.
[03:03:25.092 --> 03:03:29.840]  The best that you can do is just get out of the way of any nuclear power station or anything to do with it.
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:30.741]  Just run away.
[03:03:31.793 --> 03:03:35.676]  Um, and even then you're not safe because of course you've got all the fallout from the weapons.
[03:03:35.676 --> 03:03:47.465]  I mean, people living in Marin County, California, of course, you know, for example, have a very high level of breast cancer because of all the fallout that landed in the Rockies after the Nevada test and then washed on down into San Francisco Bay.
[03:03:47.465 --> 03:03:56.852]  So, you know, you need to know what's going on here and you need to be aware that you're all being irradiated the whole time until you stop these people from continuing to release these substances.
[03:03:56.912 --> 03:04:01.757]  And of course, now they're talking about not even mothballing 40-year-old facilities and letting them go 50, 60.
[03:04:01.757 --> 03:04:04.319]  Those are guaranteed to blow up.
[03:04:04.319 --> 03:04:05.180]  Well, of course.
[03:04:05.180 --> 03:04:06.882]  Of course, they're just trying to make money.
[03:04:06.882 --> 03:04:08.483]  It's all about money, isn't it, Alec?
[03:04:08.483 --> 03:04:09.264]  That's what it's about.
[03:04:09.264 --> 03:04:11.827]  Keep the things going because you can make more money out of it.
[03:04:12.836 --> 03:04:14.017]  Well, I mean, what can we do?
[03:04:14.017 --> 03:04:14.777]  What can we say?
[03:04:14.777 --> 03:04:21.763]  I mean, it's a political issue, and until you can sort out the political situation and have people that you can trust... Look at Fukushima!
[03:04:21.763 --> 03:04:23.904]  They're building more reactors even after that!
[03:04:23.904 --> 03:04:27.106]  I mean, if you go by Mombayat, if one blows up in the U.S.
[03:04:27.106 --> 03:04:28.527]  or France, they'll say, build more!
[03:04:28.527 --> 03:04:29.368]  It's like, it blew up!
[03:04:30.829 --> 03:04:32.571]  But Monbiot is a fool.
[03:04:32.571 --> 03:04:34.712]  I mean, nobody takes any notice of him.
[03:04:34.712 --> 03:04:42.159]  And in his attacks on us, and his advocating new nuclear power stations, he's totally shot himself in the foot.
[03:04:42.159 --> 03:04:43.680]  Nobody listens to him anymore.
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:48.004]  LLRC.org, Dr. Busby, thank you so much for your time.
[03:04:48.004 --> 03:04:49.465]  Okay, you're welcome.
[03:04:49.465 --> 03:04:50.446]  Wow, simply amazing.
[03:04:50.446 --> 03:04:51.467]  Folks, I've done the research.
[03:04:51.467 --> 03:04:53.068]  I've talked to other physicists.
[03:04:53.068 --> 03:04:54.009]  It's so horrible.
[03:04:54.009 --> 03:04:56.771]  I mean, we've got to get rid of these things.
[03:04:56.771 --> 03:04:57.392]  We've got to do it.
[03:04:57.392 --> 03:04:58.593]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:05:01.664 --> 03:05:12.351]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[03:05:12.351 --> 03:05:14.412]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[03:05:14.412 --> 03:05:15.293]  Fluoride.
[03:05:15.293 --> 03:05:17.214]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[03:05:17.214 --> 03:05:23.799]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[03:05:23.799 --> 03:05:28.702]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[03:05:28.702 --> 03:05:31.424]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[03:05:31.744 --> 03:05:32.244]  We're good.
[03:06:01.946 --> 03:06:07.169]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[03:06:07.169 --> 03:06:07.869]  Listen.
[03:06:07.869 --> 03:06:12.131]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[03:06:12.131 --> 03:06:15.533]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[03:06:15.533 --> 03:06:18.574]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[03:06:18.574 --> 03:06:21.956]  They wanted me to go on Plavix but I refused knowing the negative side effects.

[03:08:01.567 --> 03:08:06.970]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.970 --> 03:08:12.833]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:12.833 --> 03:08:14.254]  Folks, here's what happened.
[03:08:14.254 --> 03:08:16.235]  We all got comfortable.
[03:08:16.235 --> 03:08:20.537]  It was supposedly America, the freest people in the world, everything was going to be fine.
[03:08:20.537 --> 03:08:27.761]  Then the folks that didn't want us involved in trying to make a better world began to demonize anybody who was informed, anybody who was involved.
[03:08:27.761 --> 03:08:29.822]  So even more people shut up and went away.
[03:08:30.854 --> 03:08:35.115]  You know, if you exposed the government killed Kennedy, they'd kill you.
[03:08:35.115 --> 03:08:38.477]  And now we're seeing a reawakening of sanity, of common sense.
[03:08:38.477 --> 03:08:45.779]  I mean, even mainstream media, faced with dropping ratings and everyone deserting them, do things like grill Pelosi.
[03:08:45.779 --> 03:08:48.980]  David Gregory did, and he's a big insider with the White House.
[03:08:48.980 --> 03:08:51.201]  His kids go to school with the presidents.
[03:08:51.201 --> 03:08:59.944]  He had to grill her and say she was full of prunes, as Dan Rather would say, over saying that Obamacare is a great deal.
[03:09:00.984 --> 03:09:04.206]  And the fact that she's criticizing Democrats that are trying to repeal it.
[03:09:04.206 --> 03:09:08.549]  Even the New York Times has come out and said, we can repeal this, let's repeal it.
[03:09:08.549 --> 03:09:13.252]  The problem is the special interests, whatever they come up with will be a screw job on top of that.
[03:09:13.252 --> 03:09:18.756]  Until we admit we're in trouble and have criminals running things.
[03:09:18.756 --> 03:09:23.780]  I don't want to go into a rant about healthcare, but I've studied it, you can look it up.
[03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:26.502]  It was hands down, we had the best, cheapest healthcare.
[03:09:27.571 --> 03:09:28.351]  That's how it works.
[03:09:28.351 --> 03:09:34.995]  The least expensive, the most competitive, best in the world until the mid-1960s.
[03:09:34.995 --> 03:09:43.820]  And then government got involved with regulations and special interest and big hospitals wanted to shut down their competition and shut down treatments and things.
[03:09:43.820 --> 03:09:49.083]  Look, fake treatments, quack science gets phased out real quick just by word of mouth in the market.
[03:09:50.538 --> 03:10:00.303]  But you got a bunch of government and HMOs and insurance companies wanting to fix things and wanting to get government to regulate so they could charge you way more and control the treatment you got.
[03:10:00.303 --> 03:10:04.865]  And now the market's gone and now we have a total screw job.
[03:10:04.865 --> 03:10:07.226]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls as promised.
[03:10:07.226 --> 03:10:14.990]  It's just that we've got to get rid of this healthcare system.
[03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:18.132]  And the old one we had in the last 40 years is bad and corrupt as well.
[03:10:19.513 --> 03:10:21.915]  It's just that we've got a broken system by design.
[03:10:21.915 --> 03:10:27.878]  It isn't broken for the one-tenth of one percent that are crony capitalists, anti-free market.
[03:10:27.878 --> 03:10:29.599]  You can go to the articles that are on DrudgeReport.com.
[03:10:29.599 --> 03:10:32.020]  We ought to write a story about this in more detail.
[03:10:32.020 --> 03:10:35.782]  DC, now fastest growing region of one percenters in the country.
[03:10:35.782 --> 03:10:36.943]  Yeah, it's a cancer.
[03:10:36.943 --> 03:10:39.604]  Overtakes New York, Los Angeles.
[03:10:39.604 --> 03:10:40.665]  Income gap widens.
[03:10:41.405 --> 03:10:46.811]  And again, this ultra-rich are the ones saying, get rid of the middle class and the new rich that actually make their money.
[03:10:46.811 --> 03:10:56.561]  If you're actually a real company that innovates, hires people, builds an economy, oh, you are a dirty, rotten, nasty rich person, you know, that's got 500 employees.
[03:10:58.496 --> 03:11:02.057]  But when you're big General Electric, you're tax-exempt.
[03:11:02.057 --> 03:11:03.638]  It's very simple, folks.
[03:11:03.638 --> 03:11:06.278]  And they've got all these people wondering why they're getting poor.
[03:11:06.278 --> 03:11:09.239]  The media's telling them it's because that guy lives in a mansion down the street.
[03:11:09.239 --> 03:11:11.160]  Really, the guy that buys cars.
[03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:13.020]  The guy that has employees.
[03:11:13.020 --> 03:11:14.321]  The guy that has the insurance.
[03:11:14.321 --> 03:11:15.941]  The guy that goes to the restaurants.
[03:11:15.941 --> 03:11:18.342]  Whose wife gets their hair done.
[03:11:18.342 --> 03:11:21.383]  Who gives money to the charities.
[03:11:21.383 --> 03:11:24.184]  And as they get rid of the middle class, folks, the charities are going to go away.
[03:11:25.168 --> 03:11:27.289]  This is economic conquest.
[03:11:27.289 --> 03:11:30.790]  This is getting rid of the middle class, the first thing communists do.
[03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:31.810]  But this isn't communism.
[03:11:31.810 --> 03:11:36.752]  This is bankers using the model of communism, because they're offshore and exempt, to shut us down.
[03:11:36.752 --> 03:11:45.434]  And I know I say that every show in different ways, but that's the key, key, key, key, key.
[03:11:45.434 --> 03:11:49.956]  What made America great was people admired business people that invented a cotton gin.
[03:11:51.582 --> 03:11:56.745]  Or, you know why slavery really started to get phased out and sharecropping in the United States?
[03:11:56.745 --> 03:12:05.451]  There were more white slaves than even black slaves, and black slaves probably had a little bit worse than the so-called white slaves, but the point was it was slavery all around for most people.
[03:12:05.451 --> 03:12:12.515]  The cotton gin came along and, well, now you had a machine that could sort through and get the seeds out, and people weren't as valuable anymore.
[03:12:12.515 --> 03:12:15.677]  And so then they went off and other parts of the economy grew.
[03:12:15.677 --> 03:12:18.419]  But I don't want to go off into an economic discussion here with everybody.
[03:12:19.269 --> 03:12:24.991]  The issue here, ladies and gentlemen, is innovation is what is going to empower us.
[03:12:24.991 --> 03:12:27.292]  And the globalists aren't against innovation.
[03:12:27.292 --> 03:12:34.495]  Instead, the only innovation they allow is their innovation, which is like GMO crops that should be outlawed immediately.
[03:12:34.495 --> 03:12:40.738]  And I don't mean hybridizing two squash plants to get a better... No, I mean stacking 10-15 genetic traits in there.
[03:12:42.142 --> 03:12:47.527]  Where three generations later it mutates and puts out a toxin and they don't care and just keep putting it on the store shelves.
[03:12:47.527 --> 03:12:48.547]  Like BT corn.
[03:12:48.547 --> 03:12:49.708]  Alright, I'm done.
[03:12:49.708 --> 03:12:50.269]  I'm done.
[03:12:50.269 --> 03:12:51.090]  Just very briefly.
[03:12:52.352 --> 03:12:55.476]  You heard Dr. Busby about the reactors leaking.
[03:12:55.476 --> 03:12:57.338]  The UN says 91% are leaking.
[03:12:57.338 --> 03:12:58.359]  He says they're all leaking.
[03:12:58.359 --> 03:13:01.582]  All I know is they've turned the alarms off all over the country.
[03:13:01.582 --> 03:13:04.626]  They don't even talk about problems now when they happen.
[03:13:04.626 --> 03:13:07.229]  And they tell people that work in them everything's fine.
[03:13:07.229 --> 03:13:12.354]  And in Canada they're forced to report on like every week you hear about one, you know, off-gassing, you know, a hundred million.
[03:13:13.493 --> 03:13:19.139]  Whatever is into the water and thousands of gallons of radiation released and all this other garbage.
[03:13:19.139 --> 03:13:20.700]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:13:20.700 --> 03:13:21.381]  This is crazy.
[03:13:21.381 --> 03:13:29.809]  And what I do, and it's not perfect, but from my research and what the doctors have told me, true, pure, unbound nascent iodine and a glycerin base is the best way to go.
[03:13:29.809 --> 03:13:30.950]  So we found the best.
[03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:32.472]  SurvivalShieldInfoWarsLife.com.
[03:13:33.613 --> 03:13:35.975]  InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:13:35.975 --> 03:13:36.136]  888-253-3139.
[03:13:36.136 --> 03:13:38.318]  And that's how we build this operation.
[03:13:38.318 --> 03:13:41.641]  It's my goal to bring you the very best products out there to then have excess funds
[03:13:50.069 --> 03:13:59.691]  To build a better media operation, to hire more people and pay our great crew better, and really have a first-rate operation where we can have reporters all over the country, and then finally all over the world.
[03:13:59.691 --> 03:14:06.173]  But we have to do that by the funding, so we do it via Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:14:06.173 --> 03:14:08.733]  Okay, let's go to Ramone in Florida.
[03:14:08.733 --> 03:14:11.374]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:14:11.374 --> 03:14:12.594]  What's going on, Alex?
[03:14:12.594 --> 03:14:17.155]  You know, down here in FEMA Region 6, still trucking on for the truth movement every day.
[03:14:17.679 --> 03:14:21.344]  But you should take one day out of every week to just rant, man.
[03:14:21.344 --> 03:14:22.485]  That's some of your best stuff.
[03:14:22.485 --> 03:14:31.978]  I don't remember if you... I don't know if you remember the Magellan is cooler than Justin Bieber rant, but it's probably a hundred million views strong on YouTube, man.
[03:14:31.978 --> 03:14:32.459]  It's awesome.
[03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:39.063]  You know, there are a lot of versions of that, millions of views of it, I know, and people like that Justin Bieber rant.
[03:14:39.063 --> 03:14:41.224]  I mispronounced his name on purpose.
[03:14:41.224 --> 03:14:43.826]  I mean, you know, Justin Bieber, I mean, look at it.
[03:14:43.826 --> 03:14:50.209]  He's got all that money, all that fame, and he's totally unhappy walking around wearing diaper pants.
[03:14:50.209 --> 03:14:57.032]  And it's just very, very sad that the system can make him our idol instead of somebody like Magellan.
[03:14:57.032 --> 03:14:58.693]  But you can say whatever you want about Magellan.
[03:14:58.693 --> 03:14:59.654]  That guy was incredible.
[03:15:01.263 --> 03:15:03.644]  Yeah, he circumnavigated the globe.
[03:15:03.644 --> 03:15:06.865]  We all know, we give everybody props for what props do, man.
[03:15:06.865 --> 03:15:14.348]  We've spoken a few times and I always let you know I'm down here in Miami in one of the, you know, pretty, one of the pretty run-down neighborhoods.
[03:15:14.348 --> 03:15:18.469]  Pretty much like this lower income or public assistance, but
[03:15:18.925 --> 03:15:20.086]  We're starting to wake up.
[03:15:20.086 --> 03:15:30.070]  You know, day to day we're just going helping elderly people understand about nascent iodine and what it can do for radiation or a lot of the other things on infowarsteam.com.
[03:15:30.070 --> 03:15:31.651]  And we're not getting paid for it.
[03:15:31.651 --> 03:15:32.331]  We're getting paid.
[03:15:32.850 --> 03:15:33.530]  We're good to go.
[03:15:58.497 --> 03:16:03.787]  A lot of people know the information, but understand the repercussions that come with letting other people know.
[03:16:03.787 --> 03:16:08.074]  But we know that without standing up, our children have no future.
[03:16:08.074 --> 03:16:11.180]  So we're doing everything we need to do to just bring the information to...
[03:16:11.812 --> 03:16:14.314]  Probably the people that needed the most of the lower income.
[03:16:14.314 --> 03:16:19.137]  You know, you tend to think about them as, you know, just not so smart.
[03:16:19.137 --> 03:16:20.638]  I don't think of people like that.
[03:16:20.638 --> 03:16:23.480]  You can find some of the smartest people in low income areas.
[03:16:23.480 --> 03:16:26.062]  You can find some of the dumbest in the rich areas.
[03:16:26.062 --> 03:16:29.244]  I find that people have a soul and an intellect and a love of liberty.
[03:16:29.244 --> 03:16:34.447]  Then they can be fully woken up and they want to make us all poor and all dependent.
[03:16:34.447 --> 03:16:35.908]  That's the game.
[03:16:35.908 --> 03:16:40.811]  And sure, people could point their finger 50 years ago at maybe 5% of the population on assistance.
[03:16:40.811 --> 03:16:41.472]  Now it's half.
[03:16:42.292 --> 03:16:44.033]  I mean, this is fundamentally a plan.
[03:16:44.033 --> 03:16:45.574]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[03:16:45.574 --> 03:16:47.574]  Julio in Illinois, listening on 1530 AM.
[03:16:47.574 --> 03:16:50.236]  Go ahead, Julio.
[03:16:50.236 --> 03:16:51.136]  Hello, Alex.
[03:16:51.136 --> 03:16:58.359]  First off, prayers to all those in central Illinois after yesterday's devastating storms.
[03:16:58.359 --> 03:16:59.660]  Thoughts and prayers go out to them.
[03:16:59.660 --> 03:17:02.141]  So much stuff going on, Alex.
[03:17:02.141 --> 03:17:04.922]  It's crazy to see everything happening so fast.
[03:17:05.302 --> 03:17:05.783]  We're good to go.
[03:17:23.220 --> 03:17:29.524]  The document headline is, TSA should limit future funding for behavior detection activities.
[03:17:29.524 --> 03:17:34.426]  It goes into how TSA's SPOT program is basically a waste of money.
[03:17:34.426 --> 03:17:38.609]  SPOT is Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques.
[03:17:38.609 --> 03:17:42.191]  TSA is set to ask for about $5 billion, or about $3 billion, excuse me,
[03:17:44.432 --> 03:17:44.933]  We're good to go.
[03:18:07.413 --> 03:18:26.586]  The Department of Defense, teaming up with a bunch of major universities, are gathering all the data from all over the world, including Eastern Michigan University, Michigan University, Arizona State, the document it describes, developed a theological framework for analyzing key figures
[03:18:27.006 --> 03:18:28.026]  We're good to go.
[03:18:43.391 --> 03:18:46.474]  Oh no, speaking of DrugsReport.com, our story is on the right hand side.
[03:18:46.474 --> 03:18:51.059]  I had noticed that TSA rolls out detention pods at airport terminals.
[03:18:51.059 --> 03:18:52.180]  And that's what these are.
[03:18:52.180 --> 03:18:57.285]  When you go into a bank in Italy, you walk in, it locks behind you, they have to authorize letting you in.
[03:18:57.285 --> 03:19:00.328]  But this is to leave the airport.
[03:19:00.328 --> 03:19:05.493]  This is a way to totally break you and your family up, to put you in these one at a time.
[03:19:05.493 --> 03:19:07.375]  And this is their plan for society.
[03:19:08.413 --> 03:19:23.271]  And what's frustrating is it was two, three years ago that Liberty Guard with former congressman Bob Barr sued because they got the cover sheet from an insider and they confirmed it was happening that Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, InfoWars.com, DrudgeReport.com
[03:19:24.439 --> 03:19:39.774]  And other names, I think it was on the Ron Paul and others, are listed as extremists, and they have secret files on us, and they actually demonize us in the classes, and then they declared national security in the lawsuit, and last time I heard InfraGard.
[03:19:40.495 --> 03:19:41.636]  Alex man, this is my first time calling in.
[03:19:41.636 --> 03:19:43.717]  I've been listening for about a year now, ever since the Sandy Hook.
[03:19:43.717 --> 03:19:47.979]  The other day I got the Nathan Iodine in, and literally after maybe 30 seconds to a minute,
[03:20:09.139 --> 03:20:12.782]  After taking those drugs, man, my mind just, it hit.
[03:20:12.782 --> 03:20:15.844]  It was a wave of just something different.
[03:20:15.844 --> 03:20:21.949]  And now I've got these headaches, and I think I remember from listening to your show, it's the part of the detox that your body goes through.
[03:20:21.949 --> 03:20:25.872]  Yeah, listen, I warn people up front about this, and again, I'm not screening the calls.
[03:20:25.872 --> 03:20:27.533]  Everybody's calling it about iodine.
[03:20:27.533 --> 03:20:29.855]  We may have to ban people doing that.
[03:20:29.855 --> 03:20:33.057]  There's so many positive reviews, it sounds canned, but it's not.
[03:20:33.057 --> 03:20:34.899]  I forget the effect that Dr.
[03:20:36.420 --> 03:20:37.881]  Well, Dr. Brownstein talks about it.
[03:20:37.881 --> 03:20:38.722]  He's a medical doctor.
[03:20:38.722 --> 03:20:42.885]  Then you've got the other folks, the pharmacists, to talk about it.
[03:20:42.885 --> 03:20:44.947]  But also, Dr. Groot talks about it.
[03:20:44.947 --> 03:20:45.967]  It has a scientific name.
[03:20:45.967 --> 03:20:46.748]  I forget the name of it.
[03:20:46.748 --> 03:20:47.529]  I've read all the literature.
[03:20:49.037 --> 03:20:52.719]  But after a few weeks, there's an effect.
[03:20:52.719 --> 03:20:53.379]  That might be it.
[03:20:53.379 --> 03:20:54.080]  Look it up.
[03:20:54.080 --> 03:20:59.943]  And it's a detoxing effect when it starts drawing out the fluoride, other stuff in your body that you feel it.
[03:20:59.943 --> 03:21:02.004]  And about a month, I began to feel it.
[03:21:02.004 --> 03:21:05.486]  Some people, it's a few days, depending on how toxic you are.
[03:21:05.486 --> 03:21:09.888]  And then reportedly, and again, I'm no doctor, so I shouldn't even talk about this, but I'm just giving you what I remember him saying.
[03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:17.133]  Then it goes away after a while, and then you get the clarity.
[03:21:17.133 --> 03:21:18.834]  And that's exactly what I've gone through.
[03:21:18.834 --> 03:21:36.967]  And the issue is, if you're deficient for decades in iodine, or your body can't break down the type that's in the food chain now that's chemically bound, when you get unbound, pure, atomic iodine, the real deal, I mean, it's a big deal of what it does to, reportedly, the glands, the hormones, everything.
[03:21:36.967 --> 03:21:39.529]  So go ahead and describe what's happened for you.
[03:21:40.598 --> 03:21:43.220]  Well, yeah, I started taking it yesterday.
[03:21:43.220 --> 03:21:46.002]  I got it, and I took it, and boom!
[03:21:46.002 --> 03:21:48.204]  It was like a drug, it was like a high.
[03:21:48.204 --> 03:21:58.973]  I mean, my mind was clear, I was more focused, it was more energy, and I have a hereditary family of suffering from hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.
[03:21:58.973 --> 03:22:00.654]  Both kinds of forms of thyroidism.
[03:22:00.654 --> 03:22:05.778]  Which, by the way, is epidemic, and that effect is when the iodine kills the bad bacteria in your gut.
[03:22:05.778 --> 03:22:07.540]  But there's another effect he was talking about.
[03:22:10.538 --> 03:22:13.882]  I mean, it's great.
[03:22:13.882 --> 03:22:14.723]  I don't know how to explain it.
[03:22:14.723 --> 03:22:20.310]  I just feel a difference, a catastrophic difference from the way I was used to going.
[03:22:20.310 --> 03:22:25.196]  I'm 21 years old and I've caught on to this early now and I try to get my family on it.
[03:22:25.751 --> 03:22:30.753]  But this stuff that you've come out with is just really changing things around.
[03:22:30.753 --> 03:22:38.156]  You know, they always told me to take these pills, but as soon as I took the drops, it was like I was putting on some different kind of glasses.
[03:22:38.156 --> 03:22:39.257]  I could see differently.
[03:22:40.201 --> 03:22:42.223]  In the form of health-wise.
[03:22:42.223 --> 03:22:44.304]  It's just a 100% benefit.
[03:22:44.304 --> 03:22:49.767]  Well, actually, I'm not going to get into what the medical doctors have told me, just because it sounds too ridiculous.
[03:22:49.767 --> 03:22:58.893]  But the whole issue is there's all sorts of these toxins, these fluorines, these halogens all over the body, and in different nerve tissues, you name it.
[03:22:58.893 --> 03:23:03.076]  And all I'm saying is consult a physician before you take it.
[03:23:04.141 --> 03:23:07.823]  Because a lot of people are so toxic, Lord knows what it'll do to you.
[03:23:07.823 --> 03:23:12.987]  And again, this is compared to the pill iodine you can buy at the store that the government recommends.
[03:23:12.987 --> 03:23:17.710]  It's somewhat toxic from what I've read, but still better than nothing.
[03:23:17.710 --> 03:23:19.071]  This stuff isn't even as strong.
[03:23:19.071 --> 03:23:22.613]  It doesn't matter because it's electrified, basically.
[03:23:22.613 --> 03:23:24.514]  And it's pure.
[03:23:24.514 --> 03:23:26.436]  And it's bioavailable.
[03:23:26.436 --> 03:23:27.656]  That's the difference with this stuff.
[03:23:27.656 --> 03:23:32.800]  Look, as much as I knew about fluoride and the fluoride conspiracy, as much as I knew about all this stuff,
[03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:46.625]  I was sitting right beside this the whole time and just kept talking to experts and nutritionists and scientists and medical doctors and pharmacists and they kept saying iodine, iodine, iodine.
[03:23:46.625 --> 03:23:49.686]  So I got on the Monofilin the last year, really felt that.
[03:23:49.686 --> 03:23:53.367]  My wife's like, whoa, you know, you bring on these supplements, but this is dynamite.
[03:23:53.367 --> 03:23:57.069]  Monofilin we sell, but you know, any brown seaweed, Southern Hemisphere is better than nothing.
[03:23:58.599 --> 03:23:59.279]  I don't know.
[03:24:29.625 --> 03:24:30.765]  It's just amazing.
[03:24:30.765 --> 03:24:36.847]  But it doesn't matter because the Zuni's out of the bottle and another factory has now been built separately in Texas.
[03:24:36.847 --> 03:24:39.628]  It's actually in New Mexico, but it's run from Texas.
[03:24:39.628 --> 03:24:45.090]  That's not where ours is coming from yet, but it's very exciting.
[03:24:45.090 --> 03:24:46.391]  It's very, very exciting.
[03:24:46.391 --> 03:24:49.512]  And again, it turns out the establishment already knows all this.
[03:24:49.512 --> 03:24:52.793]  In fact, it turns out we are not the only place that has this.
[03:24:52.793 --> 03:24:57.395]  It turns out there's private development and this has been going on for a long time.
[03:24:57.395 --> 03:24:58.335]  And guess who's taking it?
[03:24:59.900 --> 03:25:01.601]  The establishment.
[03:25:01.601 --> 03:25:05.022]  And that's why they're taking such notice to us promoting it.
[03:25:05.022 --> 03:25:08.043]  Is that this is their little secret.
[03:25:08.043 --> 03:25:08.744]  Well, of course!
[03:25:08.744 --> 03:25:11.285]  They're bombing us with all the bad halogens.
[03:25:11.285 --> 03:25:15.326]  Because your body's got to have them one way or the other, so they'll use the bad ones if the good one isn't there.
[03:25:15.326 --> 03:25:17.107]  I mean, they want a bunch of zombies.
[03:25:17.107 --> 03:25:18.187]  What do you think's going on here?
[03:25:18.187 --> 03:25:22.649]  Do you call it the fluoride conspiracy or the iodine conspiracy?
[03:25:22.649 --> 03:25:24.850]  I don't know what you call it, but I mean, it's real, folks.
[03:25:26.243 --> 03:25:26.603]  It's real.
[03:25:26.603 --> 03:25:28.064]  It's like if you don't have water, you'll die.
[03:25:28.064 --> 03:25:31.928]  I mean, if you don't have iodine, you'll die.
[03:25:31.928 --> 03:25:34.790]  If you don't have essential fatty acids, you'll die.
[03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:37.872]  And they tell you don't eat a diet that has fat, period.
[03:25:37.872 --> 03:25:39.834]  Well, your brain will shrivel up if you don't eat fat.
[03:25:42.657 --> 03:25:45.219]  I mean, this is not rocket science, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:25:45.219 --> 03:25:47.541]  And you don't have to get our iodine, by the way.
[03:25:47.541 --> 03:25:54.267]  The gourmet salts that I have no stock in and don't sell, the Himalayan and others, they got online studies that will break them down.
[03:25:54.267 --> 03:25:55.108]  Just look them up for yourself.
[03:25:55.108 --> 03:25:56.148]  Talk to your doctor.
[03:25:56.148 --> 03:25:57.149]  They'll tell you, no salt.
[03:25:57.149 --> 03:25:58.891]  Bloomberg says, we'll arrest you if you have salt.
[03:25:58.891 --> 03:26:00.492]  Well, yeah, not the processed garbage salt.
[03:26:00.492 --> 03:26:01.233]  That probably is bad.
[03:26:02.665 --> 03:26:11.670]  The gourmet salts that have been in the mountains, you know, for millions of years, back when those were oceans, those gourmet salts, folks, have the iodine in them.
[03:26:11.670 --> 03:26:14.011]  I'm not trying to not sell my product.
[03:26:14.011 --> 03:26:18.974]  I just want everybody to know about Himalayan salts, period.
[03:26:18.974 --> 03:26:19.634]  Okay?
[03:26:19.634 --> 03:26:21.876]  Yeah, there's Dr. Merkul up there talking about them.
[03:26:21.876 --> 03:26:23.857]  Okay, let's go to another caller here.
[03:26:23.857 --> 03:26:24.977]  Mercedes in Oregon.
[03:26:24.977 --> 03:26:27.519]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:26:27.519 --> 03:26:27.899]  Hello?
[03:26:27.899 --> 03:26:28.359]  Hi.
[03:26:29.850 --> 03:26:36.012]  Hi, I wanted to say a few things.
[03:26:36.012 --> 03:26:53.116]  My daughter and I, we pray for you and we love you because you speak the truth in this world of lies and that you're actually doing things to fight against the evil.
[03:26:55.199 --> 03:27:06.884]  Well, I'm just trying to defeat the tyranny and trying to, you know, score one for the team at the same time trying to promote freedom and prosperity through the free market and liberty.
[03:27:06.884 --> 03:27:08.104]  So please don't thank me, ma'am.
[03:27:08.104 --> 03:27:10.405]  Thank you for being a listener and a supporter.
[03:27:10.405 --> 03:27:11.506]  What did you call in about today?
[03:27:13.471 --> 03:27:16.012]  I called in about several things.
[03:27:16.012 --> 03:27:18.572]  Of course, the iodine.
[03:27:18.572 --> 03:27:25.013]  I've been using it for over a month for my daughter and I. Great effects.
[03:27:25.013 --> 03:27:29.514]  Hair loss was restored.
[03:27:29.514 --> 03:27:36.816]  And I'm sure there's other things that... Well, ma'am, we didn't screen your calls, but I think I'm going to have to put a ban on iodine calls.
[03:27:36.816 --> 03:27:38.356]  What is going on?
[03:27:38.356 --> 03:27:41.537]  I've never gotten such positive feedback.
[03:27:41.537 --> 03:27:42.097]  Go ahead.
[03:27:42.708 --> 03:27:44.128]  Yes, thank you.
[03:27:44.128 --> 03:27:59.493]  Also, the fact that you have a testimony of Christ is amazing because that actually helped me to understand what you're talking about.
[03:27:59.493 --> 03:28:02.234]  I didn't really understand.
[03:28:02.234 --> 03:28:03.334]  I was listening to you.
[03:28:03.334 --> 03:28:09.416]  I could go and do research, but it wasn't sinking in.
[03:28:09.416 --> 03:28:12.457]  Once I got a testimony of Jesus Christ,
[03:28:13.528 --> 03:28:17.750]  Uh, I understood what's going on in the world.
[03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:27.893]  I understood the evil is attacking the people, getting their bodies sick to get to the soul.
[03:28:27.893 --> 03:28:35.016]  How, you know, that makes it a lot easier job for them to get a person's spirit.
[03:28:35.016 --> 03:28:37.797]  Once you got their body, I'll, you know,
[03:28:38.737 --> 03:28:40.338]  Whoa, she just said it.
[03:28:40.338 --> 03:28:44.119]  The New World Order wants our body, because then it gets our soul.
[03:28:44.119 --> 03:28:45.839]  They are literally knocking down the gates.
[03:28:45.839 --> 03:28:46.220]  That's it.
[03:28:46.220 --> 03:28:47.540]  And that's it.
[03:28:47.540 --> 03:28:49.701]  They want to kill, steal, and destroy us.
[03:28:49.701 --> 03:28:54.582]  Once you understand that the New World Order is demon-powered, it's like they have computers with Intel inside.
[03:28:54.582 --> 03:28:57.043]  New World Order, Satan inside.
[03:28:57.043 --> 03:29:02.165]  We only have an Obama poster with it, you know, on his lapel, like, powered by Satan.
[03:29:02.165 --> 03:29:02.965]  God bless you, ma'am.
[03:29:02.965 --> 03:29:03.745]  I appreciate your call.
[03:29:03.745 --> 03:29:05.206]  I've got to go to Alfred real quick.
[03:29:06.192 --> 03:29:06.812]  No, it's not, Alfred.
[03:29:06.812 --> 03:29:07.212]  It's Rose.
[03:29:07.212 --> 03:29:08.433]  Rose, I've only got a minute left.
[03:29:08.433 --> 03:29:09.413]  You say there's U.N.
[03:29:09.413 --> 03:29:10.213]  in South Carolina.
[03:29:10.213 --> 03:29:12.454]  Tell me quickly.
[03:29:12.454 --> 03:29:14.694]  Do you know if they are delivering U.N.
[03:29:14.694 --> 03:29:18.375]  tanks to South Carolina police departments?
[03:29:18.375 --> 03:29:21.616]  I've heard that in several different places.
[03:29:21.616 --> 03:29:24.937]  Did you say, do I know if they're delivering me?
[03:29:24.937 --> 03:29:26.297]  Delivering U.N.
[03:29:26.297 --> 03:29:28.558]  tanks to South Carolina.
[03:29:28.558 --> 03:29:30.378]  I've heard that in several different places.
[03:29:31.018 --> 03:29:37.341]  Well, they are having a big drill up there, and they are delivering armored vehicles to police departments all over the country from Homeland Security, ma'am.
[03:29:37.341 --> 03:29:38.442]  So, yes.
[03:29:38.442 --> 03:29:39.743]  Yes, I mean, that is going on.
[03:29:39.743 --> 03:29:42.324]  But, I mean, it's all just part of the internet nationalization of everything.
[03:29:42.324 --> 03:29:44.265]  All right, I'm out of town.
[03:29:44.265 --> 03:29:44.805]  I'm out of town.
[03:29:44.805 --> 03:29:45.405]  I'm out of time.
[03:29:45.405 --> 03:29:46.126]  I'm really tired now.
[03:29:46.126 --> 03:29:47.967]  I've been doing three and a half hours.
[03:29:47.967 --> 03:29:48.827]  And, uh, we're gonna go.
[03:29:48.827 --> 03:29:51.008]  I am going out of town to Dallas, coming up in a few days.
[03:29:51.008 --> 03:29:52.409]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.409 --> 03:29:53.570]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.570 --> 03:29:54.910]  Nightly News coming up tonight.
[03:29:54.910 --> 03:29:57.612]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
