[00:00:06.584 --> 00:00:10.768]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.230]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:13.932]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:18.136]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:22.841]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:39.259]  Well, I barely made it to work today.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.481]  Not once, but twice.
[00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:56.688]  Police are so recklessly driving on the highways that the nanny that we have that comes three days a week, because my wife homeschools the children and needs help sometimes, the police just pulled out in front of cars.
[00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:01.670]  When people see police, they just begin slamming on their brakes.
[00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.411]  Someone ran into the back of her.
[00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:04.972]  We had to deal with that.
[00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:16.882]  And she was crying when she called us and I had to drive out there onto 71 by 290.
[00:01:17.602 --> 00:01:30.246]  And then on my way to work on 290, a motorcycle cop under the First Street Bridge in Austin is radar gunning people, 70 mile an hour speed limit.
[00:01:31.822 --> 00:01:51.496]  And I looked down, I was going 70, had it on cruise control, but I wondered why he pulled out right behind me, got right up on my tail, and then shot around me at about 100 miles an hour, 90 miles an hour, down behind this woman, so fast you couldn't know what was going on, and he's pointing pull over to the left, to the median.
[00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:53.837]  That's where they like to pull you over on 290.
[00:01:55.746 --> 00:02:07.555]  And she doesn't immediately do it, so he gyrates and guns it over, and cars swerve and almost hit each other and almost slam into me, as everyone's slamming their brakes on, so he can tell her, get over.
[00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.998]  And obviously, I couldn't grab my cell phone and shoot video while this is happening.
[00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:15.200]  I'm gonna put a dash cam in my car, but still, that would have been dangerous to even reach up and hit that.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.982]  I mean, just reckless driving, police just everywhere.
[00:02:18.643 --> 00:02:19.844]  I mean, it's like Road Warrior.
[00:02:20.904 --> 00:02:22.806]  It is like absolute Road Warrior.
[00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:23.726]  I mean, I...
[00:02:24.864 --> 00:02:29.829]  I mean, literally, just to, and I see this all the time, but not twice in a row.
[00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.811]  Not twice in a row.
[00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:37.576]  And man, I was like, man, that cop's like right up on my tail and right on me.
[00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:38.557]  I'm like, why is he sitting there?
[00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:43.081]  And then I'm over and then zooming up and then I get over and then she doesn't get over.
[00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:46.344]  So he gets over that needs the tapes on that.
[00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:47.405]  I need to be pulled.
[00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:47.905]  That was it.
[00:02:51.823 --> 00:02:55.846]  10 roughly this morning on 290 under the first street bridge is where that started.
[00:02:56.707 --> 00:02:59.569]  And of course the cops will, if they even review it, will go, good job Bob!
[00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.210]  You scared the hell out of them slaves!
[00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:08.849]  How many cops do I know and do I see in the news, though, that lose their kids to cop-caused accidents?
[00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.470]  Hey, cops, your kids are all going to get killed by cops.
[00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.750]  That's how God works.
[00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.512]  He'll just take the protection away, your kids are going to end up getting paralyzed or dead.
[00:03:16.772 --> 00:03:17.692]  And I'm sad about that.
[00:03:17.912 --> 00:03:19.253]  Go ahead and drive as reckless as you want.
[00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:20.213]  And laugh about it.
[00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:28.276]  It's like in Miami when this woman has a sign about the First Amendment at a protest and they shoot her with rubber bullets, knocking her eyeball partially out.
[00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:36.060]  And then it shows them at the briefing after the police chief going, or the deputy chief going, good job shooting that woman in the face with a sign!
[00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:42.284]  The new world order is gonna drag you to hell.
[00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:45.926]  So go ahead and enjoy it all you want.
[00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:47.768]  And again, I'm not anti-police.
[00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:51.370]  I'm anti-North Korean police, Mexican police, corrupt police.
[00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.253]  And there is a twisting of the police going on in this country massively.
[00:03:57.572 --> 00:04:00.673]  And I mean, it's dangerous coming to work in the morning with the police.
[00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:01.693]  It is.
[00:04:01.873 --> 00:04:03.294]  And it's dangerous to them, too.
[00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:07.775]  And I'm just tired of dodging the police all day.
[00:04:08.676 --> 00:04:13.217]  But you had a victory, had a big wreck, big pileup on 290, and then again on 290.
[00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:15.798]  I'm saying 71, that's right by it.
[00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:24.720]  Okay, I'm done talking about that until later when I bring up the story again to tie it into, basically, You Reef What You Sow, but I think I already did that.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.623]  The big news here today is obviously up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:32.663 --> 00:04:34.223]  Report, U.S.
[00:04:34.284 --> 00:04:37.625]  attack on Syria to begin Saturday.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.382]  And the London Guardian reports U.N.
[00:04:40.422 --> 00:04:43.005]  inspectors to leave on Saturday, live updates.
[00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:44.407]  And so that's the word.
[00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:50.775]  I don't know if that's actually the case because momentum is mounting against this.
[00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:57.623]  But we're going to break down all the angles of it and get into gun confiscations that are accelerating under federal auspices nationwide.
[00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:58.124]  Stay with us.

[00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:17.966]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:20.347]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:05:20.668 --> 00:05:21.708]  They're the good guys.

[00:06:02.256 --> 00:06:04.338]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:11.965]  Why do thousands of people sit in these re-occurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:17.050]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.252]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.034]  If every one of us who can...
[00:06:21.374 --> 00:06:22.616]  We'll take care of ourselves.
[00:06:22.896 --> 00:06:25.619]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.

[00:08:18.792 --> 00:08:24.895]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:25.316 --> 00:08:26.817]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:44.407]  Well, we could be just three days away from a NATO open bombardment of the sovereign nation of Syria that has had NATO
[00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:56.172]  Along with Turkey, who's also a member, and then Jordan, who's affiliated, Israel, who's affiliated, but not part of NATO, as well as jihadis out of Iraq.
[00:08:57.353 --> 00:09:08.963]  They have been facing a two and a half year insertion of hundreds of thousands of Al Qaeda and assorted jihadi forces engaging in unimaginable war crimes, killing more than 200,000 people.
[00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:20.076]  Most of them civilians by the rebels who are called activists and protesters by CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and others.
[00:09:20.617 --> 00:09:21.298]  It is unbelievable.
[00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:23.220]  It is a war on reality.
[00:09:23.621 --> 00:09:26.404]  Now the good news is even the New York Times has had to admit
[00:09:27.335 --> 00:09:37.620]  That okay, there's really no proof Assad did this and the Israeli proof that they put out is actually the top general yelling at his troops saying you better not be the ones that are behind this.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.601]  So that's their proof.
[00:09:41.802 --> 00:09:44.223]  Why would the Assad regime
[00:09:45.443 --> 00:09:59.031]  That's been gaining ground against the Al Qaeda forces in the West and the whole globalist Anglo-American world ganging up on them with the jihadis Why would they do the one thing that allows the open air bombardment by cruise missiles fighter bombers bombers you name it?
[00:09:59.811 --> 00:10:01.332]  We've already talked all about that but
[00:10:01.852 --> 00:10:09.519]  The big issue here is the most widely circulated newspaper in Israel is reporting U.S.
[00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:12.502]  attack on Syria to begin Saturday.
[00:10:12.562 --> 00:10:15.104]  And we have that up on Infowars.com.
[00:10:17.452 --> 00:10:28.827]  And the writer that wrote the article has also tweeted, this is a big Likud style paper, very closely associated with Benjamin Netanyahu and those in power in the Knesset.
[00:10:29.308 --> 00:10:31.831]  So we hope this isn't just saber rattling.
[00:10:32.472 --> 00:10:37.033]  This is very, very scary for anybody that understands geopolitically what this means.
[00:10:37.373 --> 00:10:37.913]  But U.S.
[00:10:37.973 --> 00:10:39.993]  attack on Syria to begin Saturday.
[00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.094]  Onslaught to begin with U.N.
[00:10:42.294 --> 00:10:43.334]  inspectors leave.
[00:10:43.654 --> 00:10:46.654]  And that is in the London Guardian as well.
[00:10:47.094 --> 00:10:48.015]  Syrian crisis.
[00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:48.195]  U.N.
[00:10:48.235 --> 00:10:49.575]  inspectors leave on Saturday.
[00:10:50.335 --> 00:10:51.115]  Live updates.
[00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:53.156]  CNN reports Obama.
[00:10:53.316 --> 00:10:53.596]  U.S.
[00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:56.476]  concludes Syria carried out chemical weapons attack.
[00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.117]  That came out last night.
[00:10:59.697 --> 00:11:01.597]  And then they don't give any proof.
[00:11:03.946 --> 00:11:18.261]  Very bizarre, and you saw, of course, Kerry three days ago now, the Secretary of State saying, we know they did it, we have conclusive proof, and then six minutes later going, we know there was chemical weapons that were released, that's the proof, we don't know who did it.
[00:11:19.827 --> 00:11:31.261]  So just incredible to see this going on because they don't have 72% support like they did in Gallup Poll and 75% in Pew and others like they had back in March.
[00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:35.887]  Was it March 15th of 2003 when the second Iraq war launched?
[00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:52.886]  And even though that war was based on fraud and lies and was for defense contractors to make money and to destabilize the Middle East and begin this, you know, that core takeover to be able to invade and destabilize the whole area, as they're now doing, that's part of the official PENAC plan, the Pentagon plan, and Wesley Clark's talked about that and it's on record.
[00:11:54.372 --> 00:11:58.814]  Bush did go get congressional authorization, and he did get U.N.
[00:11:58.874 --> 00:12:01.015]  authorization, which I said at the time he didn't need.
[00:12:01.675 --> 00:12:04.557]  Though you don't want to start World War III with the Russians, so I guess he did need it.
[00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:09.439]  The point is, is that the real authorization, under law, has to come from our Congress.
[00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:12.960]  They control the purse, they control the war making.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.382]  The President is given a declaration of war.
[00:12:17.355 --> 00:12:19.597]  Now they call it an authorization, even that's unconstitutional.
[00:12:19.877 --> 00:12:24.441]  But see, now they've gotten away from that to just, I'll do whatever I want, and NATO's, you know, the reason I can do this.
[00:12:26.322 --> 00:12:32.087]  And that authorization, that declaration says who the war, who the enemy is, what the goals are.
[00:12:32.407 --> 00:12:38.833]  So the Congress is the representative of the people, collectively giving the order to the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:12:39.113 --> 00:12:45.058]  And the President doesn't become the Commander-in-Chief until there's a declaration of war.
[00:12:46.676 --> 00:12:49.737]  Okay, they're not a commander-in-chief until there's a declaration.
[00:12:49.997 --> 00:12:55.318]  Then we say, this is the enemy, here's our goals, here's what to be done, launch it, do it as fast as possible.
[00:12:55.839 --> 00:13:03.501]  Not, oh, we're under NATO and the UN, we're gonna bomb this country and put Al-Qaeda in that country, and then fight Al-Qaeda in this country.
[00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:10.923]  This is all about America being the muscle for a global empire, and everybody knows that.
[00:13:11.926 --> 00:13:15.108]  But we're paying for it and not even getting the spoils of it.
[00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:19.351]  So even if you're immoral, you should not want this because you're paying for it.
[00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:21.692]  And it's destabilizing the planet.
[00:13:21.773 --> 00:13:22.893]  It's extremely dangerous.
[00:13:23.794 --> 00:13:29.898]  And this very military-industrial complex that Eisenhower said, beware the military-industrial complex.
[00:13:30.198 --> 00:13:32.660]  We must guard against them in the councils of government.
[00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:38.380]  There is a technological scientific elite in control, and they are already taking over.
[00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:42.262]  This development poses the greatest threat to our nation.
[00:13:42.302 --> 00:13:44.522]  I mean, you ought to go watch the 21-minute speech.
[00:13:45.222 --> 00:13:47.363]  Because you always just hear, beware the military industrial complex.
[00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:49.164]  He said the technocrats that run it.
[00:13:49.484 --> 00:13:52.625]  Because they came to Eisenhower, Curtis LeMay and L.L.
[00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:53.185]  Lemnitzer.
[00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:56.606]  This has all come out on Frontline, PBS, Declassified.
[00:13:57.226 --> 00:14:00.227]  And they said, we want to have a nuclear war with
[00:14:01.718 --> 00:14:02.358]  With Russia.
[00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:03.259]  It's going to happen.
[00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:04.580]  We need to launch it first.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.723]  We'll only lose 10 to 15 million, but if we let them ever strike us first, we'll lose 50, 60 million.
[00:14:10.063 --> 00:14:11.785]  We'll lose more than a third of the population.
[00:14:11.805 --> 00:14:12.025]  The U.S.
[00:14:12.045 --> 00:14:14.026]  population was only like 200 million then.
[00:14:15.007 --> 00:14:24.273]  And he said, but they respected him enough because he'd been the supreme commander, allied commander in the European theater.
[00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:26.879]  That he was able to back them down.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.400]  Kennedy came in, and they're like, look, you're just a PT captain, buddy.
[00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:33.681]  We run this show, and we're going to have a nuclear war with Russia.
[00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:41.624]  And Kennedy fired them all, so they had the CIA blow his head off, but still that captain was able to launch it, because they were all kicked out of government.
[00:14:41.824 --> 00:14:46.485]  They were all hired right back afterwards, but still, cooler heads prevailed, and the Russians knew the plan.
[00:14:46.905 --> 00:14:48.486]  And like, wow, these people are really crazy.
[00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.331]  We're not going to do this.
[00:14:51.012 --> 00:15:00.508]  Plus the Russians then, it's all come out in Solzhenitsyn's book, second book, realized that, oh my gosh, the bankers are playing us off against each other.
[00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:03.193]  They put us in power, the communists.
[00:15:04.349 --> 00:15:09.130]  They put Lenin in power, they tried to keep Stalin in power, but he basically got poisoned as well.
[00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:12.331]  And so there was a counter-coup against the globalists in the Russians.
[00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:17.133]  But they were corrupt and evil and oppressive as well, but they lost that red purge.
[00:15:17.593 --> 00:15:26.235]  Kill millions every year, exterminate all the Christians, and there was like secret Christian rebellions within the Russians, within what was left of the white Russians inside.
[00:15:26.275 --> 00:15:31.657]  And so the Russians weren't as bad in the 60s, 70s and 80s, they were still terrible.
[00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:35.258]  But like, weren't Red Terror, you know, let's kill everybody.
[00:15:35.998 --> 00:15:37.159]  Because they figured that out.
[00:15:38.739 --> 00:15:40.980]  And that's why the globalists have hated Russia ever since.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.802]  Our government is run by globalists, and they ran the Russians until the 50s.
[00:15:46.802 --> 00:15:47.082]  Okay?
[00:15:48.703 --> 00:15:49.623]  Until the late 50s.
[00:15:51.044 --> 00:15:53.045]  Most estimates, mid-50s maybe.
[00:15:53.545 --> 00:15:56.526]  The point is, is this is the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.131]  And the Russians pay people to have kids.
[00:16:00.912 --> 00:16:04.513]  The Russians say the West is run by eugenicists, just as the communists were.
[00:16:04.653 --> 00:16:06.114]  This is in their newspapers over there.
[00:16:06.374 --> 00:16:09.555]  The Russians all know about the Anglo-American New World Order plan.
[00:16:09.595 --> 00:16:10.396]  They were under it.
[00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:18.839]  The Tsars... Tsar Nicholas was almost identical twin to the King of England.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.821]  Guys, show Tsar Nicholas next to the King of England.
[00:16:22.841 --> 00:16:23.642]  Pull up, like, 1917.
[00:16:23.822 --> 00:16:29.585]  Because they would visit each other, and they were so perfectly inbred that you couldn't tell them apart.
[00:16:30.206 --> 00:16:31.987]  But there's photos of them in the same uniforms.
[00:16:32.668 --> 00:16:35.730]  And the British, funded with the Rothschilds, took out their cousins.
[00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.813]  There is no other royalty worldwide that doesn't give Hildy the British crown.
[00:16:41.013 --> 00:16:46.537]  That's why they have events every decade at the Tower, where all the royalty, including the Emperor of Japan, come.
[00:16:46.957 --> 00:16:48.258]  I saw this on C-SPAN once.
[00:16:48.318 --> 00:16:49.199]  We ought to find this.
[00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:52.641]  We dug some of this up in their archives last night, looking for it.
[00:16:53.902 --> 00:16:54.162]  I don't
[00:17:10.348 --> 00:17:16.693]  92 of the royalty of the world at the tower bowing to the Queen of England and swearing fealty to her.
[00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:20.636]  Because if you don't do that, they will come and invade your country and they will kill you.
[00:17:21.136 --> 00:17:22.998]  They will drop hydrogen bombs on you.
[00:17:23.278 --> 00:17:23.918]  Yeah, there they are.
[00:17:24.379 --> 00:17:29.883]  There is the King of England and Tsar Nicholas, the King of Russia, of the Russian Empire.
[00:17:30.784 --> 00:17:34.326]  You could not tell the two men apart, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:34.827 --> 00:17:38.730]  So, you know, I mean, we owe the Russians an absolute apology.
[00:17:40.216 --> 00:17:44.740]  For letting the bankers conquer us and then do that to them to put Lennon in.
[00:17:45.961 --> 00:17:49.164]  Hundreds of thousands of Americans were shipped in, mainly out of New York.
[00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:52.987]  The Bolsheviks took them years to take over.
[00:17:53.007 --> 00:17:54.068]  They just started in 1917.
[00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:58.412]  And they murdered hundreds of thousands of military officers.
[00:17:58.492 --> 00:17:59.773]  It was just after they took the guns.
[00:18:00.013 --> 00:18:05.118]  Guys, type in Bolshevik turn your guns in poster.
[00:18:06.024 --> 00:18:11.326]  Or communist, and it shows the posters they put out in 1918, when they take it over saying, turn your guns in, it's going to be alright.
[00:18:11.546 --> 00:18:12.607]  Then they came and killed everybody.
[00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:22.851]  And you can pull this up, showing the loving commissar, the local police officer, the communist officer, and it shows guys in uniforms turning them in.
[00:18:23.212 --> 00:18:28.054]  And boy, your wives were raped really hard before they were murdered, weren't they?
[00:18:29.454 --> 00:18:31.575]  Because they're going to run a red terror here.
[00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:32.375]  There it is.
[00:18:32.995 --> 00:18:35.676]  That is their plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:36.276 --> 00:18:38.257]  One hundred and ten percent.
[00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:39.818]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:44.599]  If you go back to Goldman Sachs and the societies that founded that, on record funding the Bolsheviks.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.361]  Goldman Sachs funded the Bolshevik revolution, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:50.522]  The groups that founded that.
[00:18:50.742 --> 00:18:55.043]  All of this is pure crystalline evil.
[00:18:56.484 --> 00:18:56.744]  Okay?
[00:18:58.205 --> 00:19:10.776]  And it's time for everyone to understand how much danger we're in, and the globalists need to start big wars to destabilize the country, just like the Bolsheviks used the end of World War I to take over Russia.
[00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:19.064]  This is the exact same, they used the outside threat to set up a police state, and then when they capture the government, they get the police state.
[00:19:19.304 --> 00:19:21.946]  Just like they used Al-Qaeda to set up the police state, and then once
[00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:28.788]  A decade passes, they flip it and say, oh no, the Homeland Security is for gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, patriots.
[00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:34.913]  And now the Israeli papers are reporting, it's multiple papers now, that U.S.
[00:19:34.953 --> 00:19:36.154]  attack on Syria to begin Saturday.
[00:19:36.274 --> 00:19:37.214]  I don't know if that's true.
[00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:38.755]  I hope that's not the case.
[00:19:39.356 --> 00:19:46.580]  But Nigel Farage, the head of UKIP, the fastest growing party in the UK, a member of the EU Parliament, he says it's on.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.441]  He says it's happening.
[00:19:48.861 --> 00:19:50.202]  He says it's going down.
[00:19:50.242 --> 00:19:50.963]  It's been predetermined.
[00:19:51.003 --> 00:19:56.346]  It may not be this weekend, but they're going to give that country to Al-Qaeda for another red terror?
[00:19:57.918 --> 00:20:00.801]  An Islamofascist version, and they're gonna murder every Christian.
[00:20:02.683 --> 00:20:04.764]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:20:05.065 --> 00:20:12.352]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:20:12.812 --> 00:20:17.456]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:20:17.737 --> 00:20:19.638]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:23.020]  Every one of us who can will take care of ourselves.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.022]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:20:26.302 --> 00:20:34.105]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[00:20:34.505 --> 00:20:40.828]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[00:20:40.888 --> 00:20:41.908]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:40.212]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:40.272 --> 00:22:41.012]  This capitalism?
[00:22:41.072 --> 00:22:47.194]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:47.234 --> 00:22:50.875]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:08.552]  Please!
[00:23:08.832 --> 00:23:12.115]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:23:12.395 --> 00:23:18.561]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:23:18.822 --> 00:23:21.144]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:24.928]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.
[00:23:25.208 --> 00:23:28.391]  We are hurting down here and we need help!
[00:23:47.606 --> 00:23:48.448]  Immediately!
[00:23:48.488 --> 00:23:52.876]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[00:23:53.277 --> 00:23:57.645]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com
[00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:21.938]  When the globalists target Syria, they target America to drain our war chest and to demonize our name worldwide.
[00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:32.168]  They then take the Muslim hatred of the United States' face and logo being on this tyranny to then energize even more jihadis, which they then direct against their enemies.
[00:24:32.748 --> 00:24:36.412]  Because the public is not aware of this divide and conquer strategy.
[00:24:37.813 --> 00:24:38.974]  Now, I just mentioned
[00:24:40.322 --> 00:24:54.568]  The member of the UK Independence Party, their head, and member of the EU Parliament, Nigel Farage on RT, and he came out and basically said the UK government is the keenest of all on a Syria intervention, has already made up their mind.
[00:24:54.928 --> 00:24:56.589]  Here is a clip from RT of that.
[00:24:57.281 --> 00:25:06.923]  Well, now let's discuss the Western powers' eagerness to act on Syria with Nigel Farage, who is the leader of the UK Nepalese Party and a member of the European Parliament.
[00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:10.043]  Mr. Farage, thank you so much for joining us here on RT.
[00:25:10.063 --> 00:25:17.224]  Well, as we know, the UK Parliament is being recalled to vote on a response to the alleged chemical attacks in Syria.
[00:25:17.264 --> 00:25:18.585]  But why now?
[00:25:18.625 --> 00:25:25.746]  I mean, why not wait until the UN investigators finish their job and, you know, come up with some results of their fact-finding mission?
[00:25:27.796 --> 00:25:39.824]  Well, from the very start, it's been the British government, particularly in the shape of William Hague, and indeed David Cameron himself, who, throughout the entire international community, have been the keenest to get involved in Syria.
[00:25:39.884 --> 00:25:48.710]  You know, whether it's arming the rebels, or now, as we see today, a build-up of warplanes in Cyprus, preparations for cruise missile attacks.
[00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:53.973]  This government, the British government, has been the keenest of anybody to intervene in Syria.
[00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:55.975]  So that's why they're not prepared to wait.
[00:25:55.995 --> 00:25:57.476]  I think they also think
[00:25:58.136 --> 00:26:02.638]  That it's unlikely that they will get a resolution passed through the UN Security Council.
[00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:05.019]  And what will happen then?
[00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:09.942]  I mean, some of the countries are saying that they do not need that mandate from the UN Security Council.
[00:26:10.522 --> 00:26:11.342]  Will they go ahead then?
[00:26:11.382 --> 00:26:12.903]  Will a military action without that?
[00:26:14.864 --> 00:26:23.292]  Well, I mean, international law is something that, you know, people ideally, I would have thought, before launching a military attack, would want to have.
[00:26:23.312 --> 00:26:32.020]  And I'm sure that if we do go in for military action without UN Security Council approval, it'll be a row that goes on for decades.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:39.367]  But ultimately, international law itself is not going to stop the British and the French, and perhaps the Americans, if they choose to do something.
[00:26:40.498 --> 00:26:47.343]  Well, I mean, we're also hearing that Western powers from the Reuters News Agency have told the Syrian opposition that they will strike within days.
[00:26:47.363 --> 00:26:50.185]  But does that mean that the decision has already been taken?
[00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:53.348]  Well, I think the answer to that is yes.
[00:26:53.568 --> 00:26:55.349]  I think the British government have made their minds up.
[00:26:55.449 --> 00:26:58.612]  That's why you've got the build-up in Cyprus today.
[00:26:59.472 --> 00:27:09.600]  Parliament's been recalled because I think that throughout the Conservative Party, and indeed throughout very large sections of the media in Britain,
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.200]  Yeah, the questions are being asked.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.382]  Please, Prime Minister, can you tell us what are the aims and objectives of this mission?
[00:27:15.802 --> 00:27:18.943]  How can you guarantee that we won't become more deeply embroiled?
[00:27:19.543 --> 00:27:25.245]  And so I'm hoping that in 48 hours' time, when the British Parliament meets, we get some answers to those questions.
[00:27:25.305 --> 00:27:34.888]  But I have to say that ever since Tony Blair's time, starting off with Bosnia, we seem to go in for foreign wars with alarming regularity... Alright!
[00:27:34.928 --> 00:27:36.969]  ...and having no really clear objectives...
[00:27:37.932 --> 00:27:45.173]  That full video is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com along with analysis, text analysis.
[00:27:45.193 --> 00:27:50.374]  Look, what's happening here is people say we don't know what the motives are.
[00:27:50.394 --> 00:27:51.475]  We don't know what the objectives are.
[00:27:51.495 --> 00:27:55.555]  The objectives are trillions of dollars in weapons sales every year.
[00:27:55.595 --> 00:27:57.196]  You have to expend the other weapons.
[00:27:57.656 --> 00:28:04.457]  And then to launch a wider war in the Middle East and to encircle Russia on record, the Pentagon and PNAC plan,
[00:28:05.575 --> 00:28:07.116]  To then destabilize that country.
[00:28:07.656 --> 00:28:13.440]  I mean, Saudi Arabia two days ago on television, Steve Watson wrote an article about it.
[00:28:15.201 --> 00:28:20.125]  Said, we will launch our Al-Qaeda forces against you.
[00:28:20.225 --> 00:28:21.846]  Even called them Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:22.512 --> 00:28:26.353]  I mean, that, now, it's almost like this stuff's just all coming out in the open.
[00:28:26.793 --> 00:28:28.854]  The establishment's like, oh, you know we run the drugs?
[00:28:29.154 --> 00:28:40.637]  Sure, we'll have Fox News, BBC, CNN, MSNBC, ABC Nightly News, all come out in the same week, four years ago, and show troops growing it and loading it on aircraft.
[00:28:44.898 --> 00:28:46.318]  Oh, you know we run Al Qaeda?
[00:28:46.338 --> 00:28:48.019]  Sure, we'll just put it in all the newspapers, big deal.
[00:28:51.317 --> 00:28:58.439]  It is so lawless and crazy, and then it comes out on Infowars, and then it comes out in mainstream news.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.160]  That, oh, it looks like the rebels.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.861]  In fact, they're reporting today, oh, we can't prove Assad did it, and it might actually be the rebels.
[00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:07.062]  And they go, well, that's what Kerry said.
[00:29:07.122 --> 00:29:08.122]  I mean, he alluded to that.
[00:29:08.502 --> 00:29:09.262]  See, he covered it.
[00:29:09.302 --> 00:29:10.142]  Boy, he's smart.
[00:29:10.463 --> 00:29:11.343]  Yeah, he's real smart.
[00:29:12.312 --> 00:29:14.073]  It's like if you wrote a book, you could tell somebody what's in it.
[00:29:14.093 --> 00:29:14.793]  That's not smart.
[00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:15.433]  He wrote the book.
[00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:16.994]  I mean, he called the place.
[00:29:17.774 --> 00:29:20.735]  Clearly, he said it didn't matter days ago.
[00:29:21.435 --> 00:29:25.997]  Yeah, he said that because he knew it would come out that they don't have proof and that they're the main suspects.
[00:29:26.477 --> 00:29:27.738]  It's so amazing.
[00:29:27.778 --> 00:29:30.499]  It's like a war on logic.
[00:29:31.499 --> 00:29:32.199]  And that's what it is.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.081]  They're just trying to acclimate us with mass Stockholm syndrome that I've talked so much about.
[00:29:37.101 --> 00:29:38.422]  They haven't learned helplessness.
[00:29:39.867 --> 00:29:41.628]  And to have, uh, normalcy bias.
[00:29:41.648 --> 00:29:43.210]  I mean, it all comes down to those three terms.
[00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.171]  Where we just think this is all normal.
[00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:50.915]  I'm gonna run through what this attack could look like, and what it may do to the economy, and why they have real motives.
[00:29:51.276 --> 00:29:52.176]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.677 --> 00:29:53.898]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.918 --> 00:29:54.458]  Straight ahead.
[00:29:55.219 --> 00:29:57.881]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.603]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:30:05.843 --> 00:30:11.127]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:30:11.367 --> 00:30:18.913]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:30:19.093 --> 00:30:28.180]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:35.404]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:30:35.564 --> 00:30:38.426]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:30:38.446 --> 00:30:44.409]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[00:30:45.249 --> 00:30:45.789]  A war.
[00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:46.970]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.950]  Another plane just hit!
[00:31:02.529 --> 00:31:09.854]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:31:10.295 --> 00:31:14.078]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[00:31:14.538 --> 00:31:28.108]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[00:31:28.668 --> 00:31:30.570]  It can even purify water!
[00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:35.793]  Supernatural Silver comes in both liquid and gel for internal or external use.
[00:31:36.233 --> 00:31:47.719]  With over 180 scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, research institutions and nursing homes, Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against disease.

[00:32:02.392 --> 00:32:04.474]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:32:04.495 --> 00:32:12.103]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:32:12.524 --> 00:32:17.189]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:32:17.469 --> 00:32:19.392]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:32:19.632 --> 00:32:21.174]  If every one of us who can,
[00:32:21.514 --> 00:32:22.755]  We'll take care of ourselves.
[00:32:23.015 --> 00:32:25.737]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:32:26.037 --> 00:32:33.843]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[00:32:34.243 --> 00:32:40.568]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[00:32:40.628 --> 00:32:41.649]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.
[00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:46.232]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:32:46.252 --> 00:32:47.994]  Order two or more, get 10% off, free shipping applies.
[00:32:48.014 --> 00:32:51.017]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:33:02.093 --> 00:33:02.633]  We've got it.
[00:33:02.653 --> 00:33:09.075]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:09.175 --> 00:33:11.256]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:13.576 --> 00:33:19.238]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:22.299 --> 00:33:37.246]  Information is power.
[00:33:37.346 --> 00:33:43.669]  I'm going to get back into what's happening in Syria and how this attack may play out and what it may do to the economy and what other countries are saying.
[00:33:44.849 --> 00:33:46.110]  Then I want to open the phones up
[00:33:48.755 --> 00:34:02.954]  And in this hour we have time, if not in the next hour, to get your take as listeners on the serious situation, but also all the scandals that we are being diverted and distracted with.
[00:34:04.034 --> 00:34:07.176]  And speaking of those, I want to try to cover some of these in the next hour.
[00:34:08.057 --> 00:34:31.634]  There's a great site, KnowTheLies.com, a site where I saw this particular article last week, 100 Articles of Impeachment Against Obama, and I've told my crew to mirror this story up on InfoWars.com so it gets a wider readership, because I read through these hundred, and it's very, very accurate.
[00:34:31.654 --> 00:34:32.735]  100 Articles of Impeachment.
[00:34:34.555 --> 00:34:46.520]  Also, there's another one, Freedom Outpost, did 252 documented examples of Barack Obama lying, law-breaking corruption, cronyism, etc.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:56.204]  Because for Obama Deception 2, I'm trying to go over the lies and duplicity and the fraud of Barack Obama.
[00:34:58.012 --> 00:35:07.536]  As a front man, but it's important to study this figurehead and why they chose him as their logo, as their standard, as their teleprompter reading marionette.
[00:35:11.057 --> 00:35:15.358]  And there's just no way to plumb the depths of the hoax.
[00:35:16.199 --> 00:35:21.741]  Just like our government is illegitimate, run by foreign banks, that's a giant hoax that we even have a government.
[00:35:22.917 --> 00:35:24.139]  The Federal Reserve isn't federal.
[00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:25.000]  That's a hoax.
[00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:28.304]  Vaccines in most cases are deadly and don't even protect you.
[00:35:28.564 --> 00:35:29.886]  Their own inserts say it.
[00:35:30.787 --> 00:35:39.758]  Then they run the hoax saying there's no side effects in school handout forms, forcing shots through fraud on people, not telling them that there's not a law, lying and saying there is.
[00:35:41.052 --> 00:35:41.792]  That's a hoax.
[00:35:42.253 --> 00:35:52.957]  Aspartame in every study out there, look it up, makes you get incredibly obese and screws up your metabolism and gives you diabetes in all these studies, but they have the hoax that it makes you skinny.
[00:35:55.278 --> 00:35:57.239]  Just everything's a hoax with these people.
[00:35:57.999 --> 00:36:01.961]  And then I'm sitting here trying to decipher it all and figure out, well, what do I put in the film?
[00:36:02.441 --> 00:36:05.263]  I was up here till 10.30, no, actually 11 last night.
[00:36:05.483 --> 00:36:08.044]  I'm not bragging, it's just that there's not enough hours in the day.
[00:36:09.005 --> 00:36:15.109]  That's why when people call up and say, you should do this, you should do that, I'm not mad at the caller, but it's like, yes, I want to do more.
[00:36:15.189 --> 00:36:15.909]  Yes, I know.
[00:36:15.929 --> 00:36:29.098]  I come off like a gibbering moron half the time on radio because sometimes in the morning I'm so burnt out and tired that I can't remember, you know, what I had for breakfast.
[00:36:29.338 --> 00:36:30.839]  Because there's just so much going on.
[00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:33.981]  I've taken on too much and I'm not complaining about that.
[00:36:35.086 --> 00:36:50.318]  It's just that in a world of people that halfway pay attention and that just kind of muddle through life, I cannot imagine what it's like to not be concerned about the things that are going on in our world and that it's almost bad nowadays to care or to be informed.
[00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:54.241]  Then I realized people are just delusional.
[00:36:54.581 --> 00:37:02.688]  I run into so many losers who imagine they're successful and will talk bad about other people who are successful
[00:37:03.945 --> 00:37:08.068]  Like, oh, they're gonna fail, or they're going down, or, oh, they're not doing too good.
[00:37:08.348 --> 00:37:09.749]  Like, it makes them feel good.
[00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:16.454]  And then they themselves are completely unproductive and unsuccessful and just wicked.
[00:37:17.386 --> 00:37:32.457]  And then I look at the good, hardworking people, not just of America, but of the world, who are being sucked off of, who play by the corrupt rules, and I see the ruling establishment, who absolutely are at war with them, when it's that group that has supplied them with their empire.
[00:37:33.078 --> 00:37:33.838]  You know, when you see...
[00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:36.632]  Obama, talk about his legacy.
[00:37:36.652 --> 00:37:45.799]  You know, why did Clinton set up and use Al Qaeda to attack Serbia and then set them up and lie about and exaggerate massacres and then bombard that country's infrastructure?
[00:37:46.079 --> 00:38:03.352]  Because they had their own aircraft and automobile manufacturing and we're creating a corporate and military and mainly manufacturing center all over the Balkans and we're actually lifting up the entire area.
[00:38:05.057 --> 00:38:05.918]  Same thing with Libya.
[00:38:05.978 --> 00:38:19.145]  Libya had come out of the dark, investing in Africa, working with the West, building giant airways, aquifers, literally lifting up the entire African continent, and so it's now been carpet bombed and the infrastructure's been blown up, and it's over.
[00:38:20.426 --> 00:38:27.990]  And they're in towns all over that place, just lining Christians, blacks, you name it, up, Muslim minorities, you name it, and killing them.
[00:38:28.775 --> 00:38:30.597]  And that'll never be on the news.
[00:38:30.817 --> 00:38:49.657]  Just the fields of dead bodies and skeletons, the fields of burnt bodies, the fields of dead children, the fields of YouTube videos showing the jihadis, just blacks begging as they're chopped up with machetes because, well, it's cheaper than bullets and it's so much fun.
[00:38:50.725 --> 00:38:58.069]  I mean, why shoot, you know, 200 people in a village when you can take your time watching them bang and hacking them up with machetes?
[00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.949]  And the U.S.
[00:38:58.989 --> 00:39:04.272]  government's there to help you and there to put you in to try to turn the entire country of Egypt over to you.
[00:39:04.612 --> 00:39:10.415]  They'll call you protesters when you kill 25 police in one ambush, or turn over Syria to you.
[00:39:10.455 --> 00:39:16.378]  And, you know, if in two and a half years you can't take down a government, why, we'll just come in with a big military bombardment.
[00:39:20.464 --> 00:39:33.368]  Drudge put out a tweet yesterday that we retweeted at Real Alex Jones saying, hey, who do you root for in the build-up this fall to what could be World War III?
[00:39:34.328 --> 00:39:38.050]  Who do you, in fact, maybe pull it up for me, guys, so I'll read the exact tweet.
[00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.570]  Who do you root for this fall?
[00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:44.912]  Do you root for the U.S., NATO, Al-Qaeda, Assad, the Russians, the Chinese?
[00:39:46.024 --> 00:39:51.128]  And see, that's what it comes down to, is that it's just a bunch of crooked governments out of control.
[00:39:51.508 --> 00:39:53.430]  So you've got to then ask, well, who's the worst?
[00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:57.053]  And then you've got to ask, well, who started all this?
[00:39:57.073 --> 00:39:59.414]  Because under common law and common sense, that's who the bad guys are.
[00:39:59.655 --> 00:40:07.541]  And then it's the big banks that have hijacked Europe and the U.S., who have got offshore, you know, yachts and islands, who think they're going to be safe.
[00:40:07.881 --> 00:40:09.342]  Punching that back up, I'll read the tweet.
[00:40:09.382 --> 00:40:09.702]  Thank you.
[00:40:10.523 --> 00:40:12.024]  The guy's pulled it up on Real Alex Jones.
[00:40:12.605 --> 00:40:13.025]  There it is.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.280]  Who to root for?
[00:40:15.801 --> 00:40:16.181]  Rebels?
[00:40:16.321 --> 00:40:16.781]  Al Qaeda?
[00:40:17.001 --> 00:40:17.481]  USA?
[00:40:17.661 --> 00:40:18.082]  Assad?
[00:40:18.142 --> 00:40:18.482]  Putin?
[00:40:18.502 --> 00:40:18.822]  China?
[00:40:20.703 --> 00:40:21.563]  Just a fall preview.
[00:40:22.043 --> 00:40:23.004]  I mean, who do we root for?
[00:40:23.264 --> 00:40:25.385]  It's all like a football game to Americans.
[00:40:26.605 --> 00:40:27.306]  So many.
[00:40:27.326 --> 00:40:28.606]  But actually, I can't say that anymore.
[00:40:28.806 --> 00:40:39.931]  It was like a football game with Iraq and Afghanistan for a while, until the suicides went off the charts and the troops came back addicted to opium by design because they were ordered on prescription opiums to prime the pump.
[00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:47.249]  No, now you've got 9% of Americans not supporting this.
[00:40:47.269 --> 00:40:50.509]  So I guess Americans aren't in as big a trance as I thought.
[00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:54.290]  I guess Americans are awake to a great extent.
[00:40:55.070 --> 00:41:03.792]  But now we see the rogue government, who's been attacking Syria illegally, preemptively, aggressively, for two and a half years.
[00:41:04.012 --> 00:41:05.772]  They may not attack this week.
[00:41:06.492 --> 00:41:10.973]  They may stage some more events to try to build up the idea of, hey, we've got to act, we've got to do something.
[00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:18.772]  If they do act, what does that signify when the Congress, they've got Democrats now joining Republicans.
[00:41:19.253 --> 00:41:21.197]  Like over 70, it was 50 yesterday.
[00:41:21.618 --> 00:41:22.961]  Over 70 members of the House.
[00:41:24.577 --> 00:41:30.844]  And Senators like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are coming out saying, you will come and get authorization.
[00:41:30.884 --> 00:41:32.385]  And by the way, you don't have the votes.
[00:41:32.886 --> 00:41:34.007]  We're not going to give it to you.
[00:41:34.227 --> 00:41:35.208]  But you've got to come to us.
[00:41:35.248 --> 00:41:36.810]  You can't get that from NATO.
[00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.333]  By the way, the UN won't even authorize this.
[00:41:40.093 --> 00:41:41.715]  It's not that they're even a good organization.
[00:41:41.735 --> 00:41:42.676]  They were set up by the globalists.
[00:41:42.977 --> 00:41:44.778]  They realize this could cause World War III.
[00:41:46.044 --> 00:41:48.244]  All the different member states, but mainly Russia and China.
[00:41:48.784 --> 00:41:50.885]  And it also will discredit the U.N.
[00:41:51.665 --> 00:41:53.205]  completely if the U.S.
[00:41:53.225 --> 00:41:54.065]  is already discredited.
[00:41:54.465 --> 00:41:57.906]  The globalists want to have some institutions they control that aren't discredited.
[00:41:57.926 --> 00:42:00.386]  Because remember, they want to bring down America too.
[00:42:00.406 --> 00:42:02.847]  See, the globalists are attacking everybody but themselves.
[00:42:03.907 --> 00:42:09.988]  You've got to understand how full-spectrum dominance works from the top of the pyramid.
[00:42:11.668 --> 00:42:13.329]  The eye of Sauron is death.
[00:42:13.449 --> 00:42:14.529]  It's attacking everything.
[00:42:15.603 --> 00:42:29.450]  I guarantee you, folks, you could have 20 globalists on a space station, you know, 20 years from now, 15 years from now, if they'd nuked the whole Earth and, you know, it was inhabitable, and they go up there to the Google Emergency Space Station for the elite, they say, they're building.
[00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:30.471]  By the way, that's mainstream news.
[00:42:30.511 --> 00:42:32.572]  I don't know if they'll build it, but they're talking about it.
[00:42:32.812 --> 00:42:39.135]  They'll be killing each other over, you know, who gets the biggest area in the space platform.
[00:42:39.175 --> 00:42:39.616]  Guaranteed!
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.021]  That's the nature of these people.
[00:42:42.422 --> 00:42:45.384]  Hell would be being locked with these people forever.
[00:42:45.725 --> 00:42:51.310]  But good people have a giant blind spot to psychopaths and sociopaths.
[00:42:52.731 --> 00:42:55.292]  Because we don't operate like they do.
[00:42:55.312 --> 00:43:01.934]  Well, we need to start studying psychopaths and inbred genetic psychopaths like royal families, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[00:43:01.974 --> 00:43:08.836]  All they're doing through the UN is setting up their own new royalty where they have diplomatic immunity, where they're above the law.
[00:43:08.896 --> 00:43:13.138]  And now I'll tell this story and then get into the news and then give the number out and take your calls next hour.
[00:43:13.358 --> 00:43:14.958]  We've got a bunch of special reports as well.
[00:43:17.759 --> 00:43:20.320]  This is how being above the law comes back on you.
[00:43:22.216 --> 00:43:46.540]  Because once you create a superclass that is above the law, the minions and the enforcers of that superclass, they're going to want and relish the knighthoods, the UN directorships, the UN judgeships, the bureaucratic agenda 21 directorships, and they're going to want their own little empires and be greedy.
[00:43:49.013 --> 00:43:51.856]  And that's why tyrannies always grow, grow, grow, grow, grow.
[00:43:52.116 --> 00:44:09.711]  And the globalists think with robots and computers and automation and centralization and compartmentalization, they're going to keep control of the parasite bloom that always comes politically, on the micro and the macro, from a development like this.
[00:44:09.911 --> 00:44:12.593]  And they've written countless books admitting this themselves.
[00:44:14.495 --> 00:44:16.437]  But here's a microcosm example.
[00:44:17.694 --> 00:44:28.038]  You can pull up the statistics, you see it in the news all the time, about police chases and police riding tickets being the number one cause of death for police.
[00:44:28.738 --> 00:44:38.462]  And one of the most dangerous things, statistically, I saw numbers a few years ago in the LA Times, that police-involved crashes kill more people than drunk driving some years.
[00:44:38.562 --> 00:44:39.763]  The two numbers are neck and neck.
[00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:45.773]  And to give you an example of this, if you're out on a Saturday night in areas, you will see dangerous drunk drivers.
[00:44:45.813 --> 00:44:46.314]  It's scary.
[00:44:46.494 --> 00:44:47.795]  They're reckless drivers, they should be arrested.
[00:44:47.975 --> 00:44:49.176]  You know, swerving around.
[00:44:49.436 --> 00:44:52.879]  That's probable cause, pull them over, smell alcohol, boom, you know, you go to jail.
[00:44:52.919 --> 00:44:54.721]  You're right there.
[00:44:56.643 --> 00:45:01.006]  But instead you drink one beer an hour, and they want to go down to .5 or whatever and take you to jail.
[00:45:02.588 --> 00:45:04.750]  But talking about police, this morning, 7.50,
[00:45:08.564 --> 00:45:13.528]  I'm about to leave to go jog and then come to work, try to get here about 9.30 or so.
[00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.872]  And the nanny calls up.
[00:45:19.313 --> 00:45:21.535]  We have a nanny, because my wife homeschools.
[00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:22.957]  Comes like three days a week.
[00:45:23.597 --> 00:45:25.018]  Really nice lady, worked for us for many years.
[00:45:25.038 --> 00:45:26.620]  Very sweet young lady.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:27.641]  She's crying.
[00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:30.443]  I'm not going to say her name on air for privacy.
[00:45:30.463 --> 00:45:31.604]  And she's been rear-ended.
[00:45:37.363 --> 00:45:38.964]  And of course the person didn't have insurance.
[00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:41.785]  I didn't check.
[00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:43.065]  I looked like an illegal alien.
[00:45:43.105 --> 00:45:45.346]  But the point is, she was acting like I didn't really speak English.
[00:45:45.366 --> 00:45:49.328]  The point is, is that she's pulled up there in a church parking lot.
[00:45:49.348 --> 00:45:51.309]  So I go, you know, to start dealing with that.
[00:45:51.689 --> 00:45:53.570]  And she's crying about it because it's smashed from the back.
[00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.630]  And I said, well, what happened?
[00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:56.551]  Well, these cops shot by.
[00:45:56.571 --> 00:46:04.114]  And so everybody just slammed on their brakes because the cops came driving basically through the median, two cop cars.
[00:46:07.691 --> 00:46:09.892]  And then she saw after she wrecked, they just pulled somebody over.
[00:46:09.912 --> 00:46:11.892]  They were just going to give somebody a ticket.
[00:46:12.933 --> 00:46:16.654]  And so they pulled over and caused a bunch of cars to run into each other.
[00:46:16.694 --> 00:46:18.855]  It was out on, uh, out on 290.
[00:46:18.895 --> 00:46:19.715]  The police know about it.
[00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:20.215]  They're listening.
[00:46:20.796 --> 00:46:21.736]  Wreckers and all that out there.
[00:46:21.756 --> 00:46:23.357]  The cops pulled out in front of people.
[00:46:23.397 --> 00:46:27.698]  So they all pulled over because God had arrived and ran into each other and smashed each other's cars.
[00:46:27.978 --> 00:46:30.459]  Some of the cars couldn't even drive off and be put on wreckers.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.161]  So I'm driving in at 910 this morning on 290 again.
[00:46:36.963 --> 00:46:51.628]  I'm driving in on 290, a few miles past that, and I see up under the 1st Street Road, 1st Street Overpass on 290, Ben White as it's known, I see the motorcycle cop that's there 200 days or more out of the year.
[00:46:51.648 --> 00:46:53.149]  They're almost always there when I drive to work.
[00:46:54.729 --> 00:46:56.170]  Of course, I'm on cruise control because I know that.
[00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.531]  I'm going 70, and there's a car.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:18.599]  50 yards ahead of me, like they were going more than 72 miles an hour or whatever, because I saw the car, it's like a black Acura, and I see him jump on his motorcycle, and as I pass him and zoom right up behind me, and then he zooms out,
[00:47:21.209 --> 00:47:26.173]  And I'm getting ready to tell him how there's fluoride in the water killing him and look into the bioweapon program and the vaccines and the New World Order.
[00:47:26.413 --> 00:47:30.357]  I'm actually looking, and I'm getting ready to get my phone so I can erase some videos because it's full.
[00:47:30.737 --> 00:47:31.578]  I'm thinking, man, I've got to do that.
[00:47:31.598 --> 00:47:32.398]  I've got to download these.
[00:47:35.221 --> 00:47:37.142]  And then he's behind me about 20 seconds.
[00:47:37.523 --> 00:47:44.008]  Then he turns out and zooms up behind this woman who's now, he's behind me.
[00:47:44.048 --> 00:47:44.628]  I slowed down about 65.
[00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:47.391]  She's now about 500 yards ahead of me.
[00:47:48.936 --> 00:47:51.057]  And there's cameras all out there if the cops want to watch this.
[00:47:51.077 --> 00:47:51.517]  Of course they don't.
[00:47:51.537 --> 00:47:52.977]  They're probably just celebrating or something.
[00:47:53.357 --> 00:47:54.578]  Giving each other an award for it.
[00:47:55.078 --> 00:47:56.198]  And he runs up behind her.
[00:47:56.599 --> 00:47:57.499]  Starts going like this.
[00:47:57.579 --> 00:47:58.659]  Pull over to the medium.
[00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:02.100]  Everybody knows you don't pull over to the medium, but they do it up on 290 because that's the bigger shoulder.
[00:48:03.001 --> 00:48:04.721]  So she starts pulling over to the other side.
[00:48:05.301 --> 00:48:08.242]  And he recklessly pulls out in front of more cars.
[00:48:11.063 --> 00:48:11.984]  In the four lanes.
[00:48:12.784 --> 00:48:15.405]  And they all slam their brakes on and I almost run into them.
[00:48:16.892 --> 00:48:22.334]  And then he gets her to pull over, and as I look back, he's just angrily getting off his motorcycle to go chew her out.
[00:48:23.975 --> 00:48:25.115]  And this is my day!
[00:48:25.295 --> 00:48:34.499]  I mean, I'm driving to work, and people I know are crying, and their cars are smashed up, and wreckers, and police, and other... And I'm just, like, dodging cops, man.
[00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:43.002]  I mean, I'm just dodging this thing that kills as many people, on average, as drunk drivers.
[00:48:44.875 --> 00:48:47.099]  But you don't ever hear hubbub and freaking out about it.
[00:48:47.279 --> 00:48:49.583]  You don't see big police billboards, you know, like with the DWI.
[00:48:49.944 --> 00:48:52.128]  Click it or ticket or if you drink, drive, go to jail.
[00:48:52.148 --> 00:48:57.658]  We're watching you with, you know, ten different types of cops pointing their fingers at you like we live in North Korea or something.
[00:49:00.678 --> 00:49:12.720]  And I remember in Miami watching the Deputy Chief when a woman had a First Amendment sign out at a legal and lawful demonstration a few years ago, and it's famous, and they shoot her in the face with rubber bullets and damage her eye and she's bleeding and crying.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:22.622]  And then it shows the Deputy Chief afterwards with all these SWAT team guys and all these people in battle gear, Darth Vader outfits, going, I loved it when you shot that lady in the face!
[00:49:22.642 --> 00:49:23.502]  And they all laugh about it.
[00:49:23.822 --> 00:49:27.763]  Let me tell you something, the cops, now that I said this, may actually go pull the video of this, uh,
[00:49:28.803 --> 00:49:32.727]  Motorcycle cop, which wasn't even that reckless compared to what happened to our nanny this morning.
[00:49:33.888 --> 00:49:35.450]  I mean, it's just borderline.
[00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:36.971]  I guarantee you they'll laugh about it.
[00:49:36.991 --> 00:49:38.593]  Look at how scared they are!
[00:49:39.173 --> 00:49:39.534]  You know what?
[00:49:39.574 --> 00:49:46.701]  You're going to get calls, a lot of you cops, and I'm sad to say this, this could happen to any parent, I pray to God it never happens to mine, that your son or daughter is going to die in a car wreck.
[00:49:49.063 --> 00:49:51.265]  And, you know, maybe they're going to be paralyzed.
[00:49:51.305 --> 00:49:53.187]  You're going to get to change their diapers for the rest of your life.
[00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:57.732]  Now, see, God doesn't even really judge you.
[00:49:57.932 --> 00:50:02.773]  You engage in evil, and then your family's going to be killed by cops.
[00:50:02.793 --> 00:50:10.636]  Kind of like that guy who was a cop out in L.A., and they released the video for 10 minutes while they torture and beat his mentally ill son to death who didn't even resist them.
[00:50:11.176 --> 00:50:12.717]  And the cops are getting off on him, begging.
[00:50:12.977 --> 00:50:17.898]  You see when he begs, please, daddy, help me, and the cops go, and start getting on top of him.
[00:50:17.918 --> 00:50:18.638]  They're going to kill!
[00:50:18.658 --> 00:50:19.619]  They're going to kill!
[00:50:19.679 --> 00:50:20.699]  They're going to kill!
[00:50:20.759 --> 00:50:23.180]  Your kids are going to die at the hands of police.
[00:50:24.076 --> 00:50:26.878]  And that's why the New World Order says they want a chip.
[00:50:27.698 --> 00:50:30.000]  Or they want that ID card where they're above the law and left alone.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.041]  That's what, in California alone.
[00:50:33.843 --> 00:50:38.505]  Almost a million people, government bureaucrats and police, have immunity.
[00:50:38.545 --> 00:50:44.287]  Last time I saw it in the San Francisco Chronicle, it's more now undoubtedly, where they don't get tickets, they can run red lights, they're above the law.
[00:50:44.667 --> 00:50:48.588]  So see, you're hoping you can do that, but it won't matter.
[00:50:48.968 --> 00:50:50.349]  The system is going to kill your children.
[00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:54.750]  So roll your sleeves up, give your children some shots, people that serve the government.
[00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:57.851]  It's a sacrament.
[00:50:58.031 --> 00:50:59.332]  Show you support the government.
[00:50:59.392 --> 00:51:00.092]  Kill your children.
[00:51:02.134 --> 00:51:03.555]  Chef 5-Minute Meals.

[00:52:01.843 --> 00:52:06.727]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:08.388]  What are bitcoins?
[00:52:08.849 --> 00:52:14.933]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.

[00:53:01.297 --> 00:53:05.880]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.221]  Why do we have the highest
[00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:14.363]  Cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:53:14.684 --> 00:53:16.324]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:53:16.604 --> 00:53:17.925]  We are what we eat.
[00:53:18.245 --> 00:53:22.586]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:53:22.927 --> 00:53:26.908]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:53:27.148 --> 00:53:29.469]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:53:29.709 --> 00:53:35.611]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:54:17.524 --> 00:54:28.191]  And when your wife's dying young, or your husband's dying young, or your children's dying young, when they beg for daddy, and they're dying, a little chemical weapon, bio-weapon, you can feel good about it.
[00:54:28.211 --> 00:54:30.472]  You know you sacrificed your child to the New World Order.
[00:54:32.634 --> 00:54:33.774]  Just like when you have an abortion.
[00:54:34.034 --> 00:54:35.555]  Why not join a satanic church?
[00:54:36.376 --> 00:54:38.117]  Get pregnant, go have abortions for Satan.
[00:54:38.137 --> 00:54:39.458]  And that's what you're doing.
[00:54:40.933 --> 00:54:42.974]  Why not really get into who you are?
[00:54:42.994 --> 00:54:45.334]  It's all about how you're above the law.
[00:54:45.875 --> 00:54:47.675]  And see, that was my analogy.
[00:54:47.695 --> 00:54:54.137]  And I started talking about the case of Kelly Thomas, whose dad was a retired police officer.
[00:54:54.717 --> 00:54:56.118]  And they just come up to him and say, what are you doing?
[00:54:56.138 --> 00:54:56.938]  He goes, I'm doing nothing.
[00:54:57.298 --> 00:54:58.258]  So they start beating him up.
[00:54:59.079 --> 00:55:00.399]  And then they just kill him slow.
[00:55:00.439 --> 00:55:03.340]  I mean, of course you jump on somebody's neck and have five guys sit on you.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.921]  And they suffocated him.
[00:55:05.221 --> 00:55:07.541]  Daddy, daddy, he says it over and over again.
[00:55:07.961 --> 00:55:09.242]  They take their time and they kill him.
[00:55:10.373 --> 00:55:15.977]  And all his teeth are knocked out and his face is crushed in and they beat him and beat him and beat him.
[00:55:16.757 --> 00:55:18.899]  You know, I mean, I think that's a sacrament to government.
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:21.701]  Kelly Thomas.
[00:55:24.222 --> 00:55:29.706]  And when I think about him begging for his daddy and I think about my son, it makes me want to throw up.
[00:55:30.667 --> 00:55:32.188]  This is just when a couple of cops are on him.
[00:55:33.356 --> 00:55:35.518]  And again, they teach the cops the threat continuum.
[00:55:35.558 --> 00:55:38.860]  You know, if you're hurting somebody and they resist involuntarily, well, we'll just show them.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.622]  And then more cops show up and they beat them in the face with a flashlight.
[00:55:42.343 --> 00:55:45.205]  Here, here, here, turn it up, because, I mean, the begging for daddy comes up.
[00:55:45.505 --> 00:55:46.666]  We haven't played this for a while.
[00:55:47.026 --> 00:55:48.067]  And see, all of you that...
[00:55:48.727 --> 00:55:50.768]  Take him ten minutes to kill him.
[00:55:50.808 --> 00:55:51.888]  Oh, we love government!
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:20.781]  Keep it going, keep it going.
[00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:22.723]  We're not begging for daddy here.
[00:56:23.163 --> 00:56:28.288]  Put your hands behind your back.
[00:56:28.568 --> 00:56:31.851]  By the way, hit pause.
[00:56:32.272 --> 00:56:32.752]  Hit pause.
[00:56:32.832 --> 00:56:35.474]  It came out because there's other camera angles that were released.
[00:56:35.815 --> 00:56:38.117]  They wouldn't let him put his hands behind the back.
[00:56:38.357 --> 00:56:43.462]  They're all sitting on his hands and when he can't, they take that flashlight and they just bash his brains out.
[00:56:46.707 --> 00:56:54.393]  And that's what the, but see, see, the slick globalists wear lab coats and give you shots and GMO and fluoride and bash your brains out.
[00:56:55.632 --> 00:56:57.073]  In fact, those cops are doing that.
[00:56:57.393 --> 00:57:00.436]  I remember seeing them once they got arrested later because they lied about it and it all came out.
[00:57:00.936 --> 00:57:03.919]  I mean, they just look like total idiot thugs.
[00:57:04.759 --> 00:57:17.510]  Gang members that wanted to go have a job where, you know, you can run your motorcycle up on people, you can scream at families, you can whip out in front of cars, make people wreck, and you're in control so nobody's going to get in trouble.
[00:57:19.096 --> 00:57:20.957]  Now, I'm not even attacking the police here.
[00:57:20.977 --> 00:57:22.157]  They're where the rubber meets the road.
[00:57:22.177 --> 00:57:25.478]  There are a lot of good police that are abhorring, you know, absolutely abhor things like this.
[00:57:25.938 --> 00:57:41.564]  The issue here, the issue here, and what makes this so sick and rips my guts out, is the globalists are doing this on a mass scale all over the world in our name, and blaming people for things that they've done.
[00:57:41.844 --> 00:57:44.785]  And it shows how what comes around goes around, just like that
[00:57:45.911 --> 00:58:03.342]  Young man who was killed by the police, tortured to death, just like his dad was a decorated 26-year veteran, retired from a police department nearby, and he came out to the police are now totally evil, because they are getting more brutal, because they're soldiers now.
[00:58:03.582 --> 00:58:04.063]  What do soldiers do?
[00:58:04.083 --> 00:58:04.783]  They fight enemies.
[00:58:05.364 --> 00:58:07.165]  And if you're a schizophrenic guy, you're going to die.
[00:58:08.012 --> 00:58:08.733]  Because you're the enemy.
[00:58:08.773 --> 00:58:12.757]  These are warriors who gang up on a schizophrenic guy that weighs 140 pounds.
[00:58:12.957 --> 00:58:13.517]  You're tough!
[00:58:13.958 --> 00:58:14.899]  You can kill people!
[00:58:15.319 --> 00:58:18.662]  The point is, is that you killed a God's child.
[00:58:19.623 --> 00:58:23.147]  See, what you do to other people comes back on you.
[00:58:24.557 --> 00:58:28.660]  I see articles all the time where cops run into a thing and kill a cop's daughter.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.940]  I saw a story like that like a month ago.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.522]  And it's in the news, like, oh, it killed a cop's daughter.
[00:58:32.782 --> 00:58:34.583]  So then they get the cop in trouble.
[00:58:34.723 --> 00:58:36.504]  But only because you killed a cop's daughter.
[00:58:36.965 --> 00:58:38.025]  What about our daughters?
[00:58:38.266 --> 00:58:39.426]  What about our sons?
[00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:48.512]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:01.532 --> 00:59:07.917]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[01:00:12.889 --> 01:00:13.809]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:18.052]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.632 --> 01:00:22.774]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.537 --> 01:00:29.198]  Lay down!
[01:00:44.381 --> 01:00:52.809]  By the way, I played this clip today.
[01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:55.832]  Again, it goes on for 30 plus minutes actually.
[01:00:56.192 --> 01:01:00.617]  It takes them about 15 minutes to kill him and then they kind of have a celebration after they've killed him.
[01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:10.142]  Fullerton California Police Department murdered unarmed homeless man and of course this happened last year.
[01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:20.495]  I was just telling the story about how this guy was a police officer's son and so they did indict the cops but only because the dad was a cop and I've noticed that.
[01:01:21.138 --> 01:01:38.054]  When they kill your kid, folks, and what's sick is they're sitting on each hand and on his legs, by the end it's eight cops, and they're saying, he's saying, I can't breathe, daddy, daddy, and they just keep beating his brains out, and his whole body, and knocking every tooth out, and they keep saying, just put your hands behind your back.
[01:01:38.554 --> 01:01:44.880]  I love that, like they go, don't resist, and then taser you, and then taser you till you die, and you're just sitting there.
[01:01:46.405 --> 01:01:49.708]  And in America, they taser you if you don't answer questions now.
[01:01:50.269 --> 01:01:51.370]  Courts have said they can do that.
[01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:52.130]  It's torture.
[01:01:52.931 --> 01:01:55.653]  I mean, if they had guys in Abu Ghraib tasering them, they'd call it torture.
[01:01:55.974 --> 01:01:58.956]  And it just shows what a sick system we are.
[01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:11.588]  And my point is, do police really want to grow up in a country where they're run by foreign banks and the people are their enemies, and they consider us insurgents, and they kill a 95-year-old man
[01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:21.595]  Because, you know, he's not doing what nurses are telling him, and he has a shoehorn in his hand, and they say it's okay.
[01:02:21.635 --> 01:02:24.797]  I mean, and again, this isn't how the police were in the past.
[01:02:25.437 --> 01:02:27.178]  This is how they act in authoritarian regimes.
[01:02:27.478 --> 01:02:28.479]  This is what they want.
[01:02:29.059 --> 01:02:31.681]  And my point was, what comes around goes around.
[01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:34.822]  That's why I mentioned the case of Kelly Thomas.
[01:02:36.563 --> 01:02:38.204]  They walk over to him and they say, what are you doing?
[01:02:38.224 --> 01:02:39.305]  And it turned out he'd done nothing wrong.
[01:02:40.145 --> 01:02:42.587]  He's sitting there and he's schizophrenic and he goes, nothing, I'm just sitting here.
[01:02:43.544 --> 01:02:44.525]  So they start grabbing on him.
[01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:47.888]  Then they jump on top of him and he says, hey man, stop that.
[01:02:47.908 --> 01:02:49.229]  And then they just kill him.
[01:02:49.969 --> 01:02:55.394]  And you can see in the video, we're showing the original one that got released by locals.
[01:02:55.414 --> 01:02:58.056]  It turned out they had the surveillance tapes of the cops' lives that they didn't have.
[01:02:58.376 --> 01:03:01.799]  It turned out people inside the department released them, if you follow that case.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:11.047]  And the reason they got indicted, I haven't followed if they got convicted yet, was because they lied and said, oh, he kept resisting.
[01:03:11.852 --> 01:03:21.701]  Well, just like the guy on the dart platform, they made a movie about it, who wasn't even the guy that was in a fight, and they put him in handcuffs, he's not resisting, and then they just shoot him in the back, just, got pulled the gun out, boom!
[01:03:21.721 --> 01:03:34.773]  And then they take all the cell phones away, cop got a year for it, except one person in a train that stopped, and it drives off as the cops look, and they get the footage out
[01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:36.900]  They said he attacked the police.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.642]  Just like the FBI shot one of the Czarnev brothers' friends, who knew that he was CIA.
[01:03:42.082 --> 01:03:43.183]  They said, oh, he attacked him.
[01:03:43.223 --> 01:03:44.203]  Well, he didn't attack him.
[01:03:44.623 --> 01:03:45.644]  It's national security.
[01:03:45.924 --> 01:03:47.345]  We shot him in the back of the head, though.
[01:03:48.225 --> 01:03:50.266]  We just killed him, and that's just the way it is.
[01:03:51.026 --> 01:03:54.108]  So, you just get used to that, because we're the guys in charge!
[01:03:54.188 --> 01:03:54.888]  We're the winners!
[01:03:56.369 --> 01:04:02.032]  You're only the winners for a season, because America's being brought down, and the globalists plan a red terror in this nation.
[01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:13.889]  That's why the Army Manual that we've been reporting on since Monday openly has come out and said that the Founding Fathers are bad people and due process and freedom is bad.
[01:04:14.849 --> 01:04:23.893]  I didn't mean to digress off into this point today, it's just that I was thinking of examples of blowback where what the corrupt system does comes back on it.
[01:04:24.053 --> 01:04:25.894]  Oh, throughout history when tyrants
[01:04:27.928 --> 01:04:30.351]  Uh, bring in tyranny and it ends up destroying them.
[01:04:30.371 --> 01:04:35.016]  Hey, will you guys print me the article about Little Leagues are seen as racist in California?
[01:04:35.036 --> 01:04:37.900]  Uh, I saw an article where they're banning them.
[01:04:38.961 --> 01:04:43.326]  Uh, cause I saw that it was a Washington Times, I couldn't believe it two days ago if I'd ever covered it.
[01:04:43.987 --> 01:04:44.748]  I wanted to mention that.
[01:04:45.268 --> 01:04:46.690]  By the way, we have a Leanne McAdoo report.
[01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:53.718]  Austinites did sign petitions to ban the word father and mother and family and brown bag as Seattle has done.
[01:04:54.339 --> 01:04:58.844]  These are virulently authoritarian people who think they're liberal.
[01:04:58.904 --> 01:05:00.126]  We'll be back with that as well.
[01:05:01.727 --> 01:05:03.368]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:08:33.636 --> 01:08:36.081]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[01:08:36.302 --> 01:08:38.586]  Broadcasting worldwide, hour number two.
[01:08:40.796 --> 01:08:43.037]  Here are the headlines up on Infowars.com.
[01:08:43.418 --> 01:08:46.580]  Obama's Syria attack rationale crumbles.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.321]  Report U.S.
[01:08:48.361 --> 01:08:50.782]  attack on Syria to begin Saturday.
[01:08:50.842 --> 01:08:52.823]  That's the biggest paper in Israel saying that.
[01:08:53.344 --> 01:08:56.866]  Russia sends warships to the Mediterranean.
[01:08:57.346 --> 01:08:58.687]  Denies Syrian link.
[01:08:59.287 --> 01:09:02.629]  Boy, how do you know when government's lying when their lips are moving?
[01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:05.972]  Will war with Syria cause the price of oil to explode higher?
[01:09:07.012 --> 01:09:09.754]  Do bears live in the woods?
[01:09:09.774 --> 01:09:14.117]  50 years later, Wes defiles Martin Luther King's memory.
[01:09:15.158 --> 01:09:23.464]  Man, I tell you, I was watching MSNBC last night during a break up here editing, and I mean, it was like an absurdist cartoon of race bait pushing.
[01:09:23.704 --> 01:09:27.747]  They've just totally turned Martin Luther King Day and his dream speech into the opposite.
[01:09:28.407 --> 01:09:33.731]  And it was, legalize all the illegals, open the borders up, socialism, communism, or you're a racist.
[01:09:33.811 --> 01:09:34.432]  I mean, wow!
[01:09:35.758 --> 01:09:36.618]  Unbelievable.
[01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:38.999]  That's got to discredit these people.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.501]  I don't know how they do it day after day though, Rachel Maddow and people.
[01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:44.522]  I mean, it is bizarre to watch.
[01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:48.183]  And like, Al Sharpton in a gangster suit up there?
[01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:49.364]  Amazing.
[01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:53.052]  So, also, U.S.
[01:09:53.092 --> 01:09:55.935]  admits it has no idea who carried out the Syrian chemical weapons attacks.
[01:09:56.275 --> 01:10:01.220]  That's the New York Times, Washington's blog boils down a whole section of that.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:06.285]  I mean, this is just a criminal, rogue group that won't even put their name on it.
[01:10:06.545 --> 01:10:10.109]  But it shows how it's a rogue, shadow, corporate, Bilderberg-style government.
[01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:17.556]  Is just pushing this and then there's not even proof given and Kerry three days ago is like, it doesn't matter who launched it, Assad's horrible.
[01:10:17.596 --> 01:10:25.103]  It's all about Assad, not about the hundreds of thousands that have been killed by the West injecting the rebels and calling them protesters.
[01:10:26.985 --> 01:10:33.792]  So here's some of these headlines and then I'm going to go to a special report, Syrian hypocrisy with David Knight.
[01:10:35.555 --> 01:10:38.296]  And then Obama is saying he hasn't made a decision yet on Syria.
[01:10:38.316 --> 01:10:40.277]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:49.380]  Ayatollah, the head of Iran's Supreme Leader, says dire consequences if the United States strikes Syria.
[01:10:50.761 --> 01:10:55.842]  Sparks worries Iran could launch proxy war if Syria is struck.
[01:10:55.882 --> 01:10:57.183]  I mean, what do you think the West has done?
[01:10:57.223 --> 01:10:57.863]  It's a proxy war.
[01:10:57.883 --> 01:10:59.564]  And you're like, well, I don't like Iranians.
[01:11:00.184 --> 01:11:02.165]  Folks, what do you even know about that if you're a new listener?
[01:11:02.984 --> 01:11:05.686]  Please go watch my film Terror Storm that came out in 2006.
[01:11:05.806 --> 01:11:10.929]  You notice it talks about how the CIA staged terror attacks, brought in a Muslim extremist.
[01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:13.511]  In 1953 that was declassified last week.
[01:11:13.531 --> 01:11:15.693]  It was already declassified before that.
[01:11:16.013 --> 01:11:17.274]  They just declassified a little more.
[01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:35.207]  And they staged false flags to do it, and blamed the government, and then put the jihadis in for a few weeks to destabilize things, so people would then beg for the Shah, then they took him out in 79, put the Ayatollah back in, did the hostage deal with them, the shadow government did to set up Carter, then gave them weapons.
[01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:36.308]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:42.033]  I mean, did Iran ever invade multiple times and put foreigners in to take it over?
[01:11:43.634 --> 01:11:45.356]  I mean, did Iran ever take over the U.S.?
[01:11:45.416 --> 01:11:45.576]  No.
[01:11:47.847 --> 01:11:50.129]  Everybody just loves to hate them because they look different than us.
[01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:54.853]  And the truth is, our stinking New World Order government literally put these people in.
[01:11:55.834 --> 01:11:57.155]  Just like they created Saddam.
[01:11:57.175 --> 01:11:59.477]  They actually ran him until the end.
[01:11:59.758 --> 01:12:04.362]  With the Shiites, they don't really run them, they just wind them up and put them in charge.
[01:12:04.382 --> 01:12:07.705]  Kind of like opening the gates so the Kraken can go out and destroy Joppa.
[01:12:10.271 --> 01:12:15.297]  But continuing here, Ayatollah threatens dire consequences if U.S.
[01:12:15.337 --> 01:12:16.118]  strikes Syria.
[01:12:16.138 --> 01:12:17.759]  That is really important.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.383]  Humanitarian intervention in Syria will increase civilian deaths.
[01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:22.985]  And I'm being sarcastic there.
[01:12:23.025 --> 01:12:24.266]  The monkey cage is their blog.
[01:12:25.287 --> 01:12:28.470]  Military intervention on the side of rebels increased civilian deaths by 40 percent.
[01:12:28.851 --> 01:12:32.594]  And it goes over just what the last few years has done.
[01:12:32.674 --> 01:12:35.057]  Yeah, hundreds of thousands of dead.
[01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:39.581]  On Syria, Obama says he's eyeing shot across the bow.
[01:12:40.402 --> 01:12:43.405]  And a shot across the bow will be maybe a hundred cruise missiles get launched.
[01:12:43.705 --> 01:12:45.086]  That's probably what they're leaning towards.
[01:12:45.567 --> 01:12:50.731]  Blow up some power stations, blow up some infrastructure, blow up some military bases.
[01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:55.515]  It's hard to get their Al-Qaeda through with suicide bombers to blow up the military and police bases.
[01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:57.377]  So, I mean, that'll be what it is.
[01:12:57.877 --> 01:13:02.922]  Just so they can then say six months from now, you know, a year, a year from now,
[01:13:04.684 --> 01:13:06.306]  That'll be three and a half years into the war.
[01:13:06.726 --> 01:13:08.148]  We're two and a half plus right now.
[01:13:08.548 --> 01:13:09.830]  See, we gotta do something.
[01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:11.472]  It's like, yeah, what's going on with that?
[01:13:11.532 --> 01:13:20.082]  It's our job to go help those Syrians against that Assad guy when the whole thing's manufactured by the same globalists that have occupied America and are running us into the ground.
[01:13:21.289 --> 01:13:48.651]  And Obama's legacy is he wants to prove he's the most ruthless, bloodthirsty, cunning manipulator to get Obamacare through for the big banks, to raise taxes on everybody, including the poorest, and put in death panels, and create government control for eugenics over health care, and absolutely destroy small businesses and give waivers to all the big businesses that are part of the inside globalist club, and then sit there smiling as he cons his poor victim constituents.
[01:13:49.412 --> 01:13:53.014]  And then takes the blame for the whole agenda so the next public can be brought forward.
[01:13:54.815 --> 01:14:05.100]  And he wants what Bush got and what Clinton got and what every other president does, targeting another piece of the Global Risk Board to say, I got another piece for the New World Order.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:09.382]  And there's only six or seven big nations left they haven't taken down worldwide.
[01:14:11.063 --> 01:14:13.784]  They've taken them all down, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:15.495 --> 01:14:29.168]  And they're continuing to move forward so that no one can oppose a global government, no one has powerful weapons to oppose them, so they can then fund rebel groups to then fully bring down the governments so the globalists can bombard them.
[01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:39.525]  Most of the time, they just take over financially, bring in corporate unified as N21 over land, medical, religion, infrastructure, military.
[01:14:39.565 --> 01:14:47.512]  It's global standardization, global regulatory law that the globalists are exempt from, to then come in and force hundreds of shots every year.
[01:14:47.872 --> 01:14:48.933]  It'll just kill everybody.
[01:14:49.474 --> 01:14:51.155]  And then everybody will wonder why everybody's dying.
[01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:54.438]  And, you know, if you speak out and say it's the government, you'll be arrested as a troublemaker.
[01:14:54.658 --> 01:14:55.259]  That's their plan.
[01:14:55.279 --> 01:14:57.701]  They say they want to arrest people that, you know, say this is happening.
[01:14:58.848 --> 01:14:59.649]  You're mad about fluoride?
[01:14:59.669 --> 01:15:02.392]  You just, paramilitary group comes and kills you.
[01:15:02.872 --> 01:15:04.614]  Because it's, you know, a death squad for freedom.
[01:15:04.654 --> 01:15:06.937]  I mean, the nanny state's liberal.
[01:15:06.957 --> 01:15:07.818]  They're not tyrants.
[01:15:07.838 --> 01:15:08.678]  They love you.
[01:15:08.698 --> 01:15:10.781]  They say it in a soft NPR voice.
[01:15:12.614 --> 01:15:19.935]  So we've got that going on, and once they have this in worldwide, I mean, Katie bar the door, that's when the real depopulation starts.
[01:15:20.256 --> 01:15:42.280]  But they want to mop everything up first, before they release the bioweapons and blame it on terrorists, and then bring in a greater police state through that crisis, and then a few years later release another bioweapon, and oh, here's the guy that did it, and he's an evil patriot scientist, and we're gonna execute him, and oh, a billion died when he released the white plague, or whatever they'll call it.
[01:15:44.414 --> 01:15:45.415]  This is the whole program.
[01:15:46.255 --> 01:16:08.808]  And then further deindustrialize with the robots and automation replacing you, where you absolutely have to go on the dole with robots tending the fields and producing the food that you get from the government or from the corporate combined with the government contract, so that you are absolutely a slave in a prison, dumbed down and poisoned, before they wipe everybody out.
[01:16:09.548 --> 01:16:11.891]  And you want to know why they attack me in movies and TV?
[01:16:11.911 --> 01:16:19.178]  They've got comic books coming out where the bad guy, you know, in Marvel Comics is an evil right-wing patriot leader, and it's my face 100%.
[01:16:19.339 --> 01:16:21.501]  In fact, you can probably show that.
[01:16:21.861 --> 01:16:24.964]  They've got movies coming out, you know, where the villain is Alex Jones.
[01:16:25.005 --> 01:16:27.387]  They've got, uh, actually called Alex Jones.
[01:16:27.407 --> 01:16:27.707]  They've got...
[01:16:28.928 --> 01:16:40.290]  At least 10 shows I've seen the last decade on different cable networks where there's a bad patriot in Texas broadcasting who sounds exactly like I do, who then gets blown up by the ATF.
[01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:42.150]  I mean, they've got one script.
[01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:42.971]  They just pay.
[01:16:43.831 --> 01:16:44.991]  Because they know I know.
[01:16:45.671 --> 01:16:47.911]  And if their minions find out, they're all going to be killed.
[01:16:48.672 --> 01:16:52.032]  If people find out what this master plan is, folks, it's game over.
[01:16:53.893 --> 01:16:55.993]  So people ask me,
[01:16:58.812 --> 01:17:01.334]  Why do I not have fear?
[01:17:02.075 --> 01:17:05.618]  It's because, look, I only have fear that I won't do a good job exposing these people.
[01:17:06.078 --> 01:17:07.059]  I know their program.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.340]  I know their operation.
[01:17:08.661 --> 01:17:09.542]  I know where it goes.
[01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:11.363]  I know there's no future for my family.
[01:17:12.184 --> 01:17:17.809]  It would be a crime if I didn't expend every bit of energy I have, I would be aiding and abetting the enemy.
[01:17:19.204 --> 01:17:31.603]  In this eugenics global rewrite takeover, total hegemon, the takeover of reality, the takeover of the genetic code, the takeover of creation by these devilish forces if I didn't fully tell you what they're really up to.
[01:17:33.103 --> 01:17:44.273]  If I just played Patty Cake with the New World Order and just kind of halfway faded off, or whatever, or I became a big mainstream talk show host, I would be sentencing my children and their grandchildren to a total nightmare.
[01:17:44.773 --> 01:17:48.716]  And by the way, people always say, oh, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren will have to deal... No, no.
[01:17:49.317 --> 01:17:50.758]  We're going to have to deal with this now.
[01:17:51.399 --> 01:17:52.720]  Our children are going to have to deal with it.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.561]  You're now dealing with the...
[01:17:55.422 --> 01:17:58.663]  Front leading edge of the storm of the New World Order.
[01:17:59.044 --> 01:17:59.724]  It's going to increase 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%.
[01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:07.527]  You already noticed most people can't hardly talk now.
[01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:08.848]  The IQs are plunging.
[01:18:09.428 --> 01:18:12.969]  They're being programmed by the television, the iPads, the brains have been rewired.
[01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:15.370]  Neurological disorders are off the charts.
[01:18:15.631 --> 01:18:16.851]  People are turning off, folks.
[01:18:17.571 --> 01:18:23.294]  People are under high-tech mind control with the chemicals, the biologicals, the radiologicals.
[01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:35.459]  And we're going in to a New World Order program where they think they're saving the Earth, doing this to destroy the scourge, the infestation of 7.5 billion humans on the planet.
[01:18:35.739 --> 01:18:45.323]  And undoubtedly, a lot of the technologies are dirty, there are many areas that are overpopulated, but there are many areas that aren't, like the West is imploding, having a birth rate replacement of 1.3 on average.
[01:18:47.111 --> 01:18:56.178]  So, for every two adults, there are ways to move forward and fix this, but the globalists don't want to transfer the clean new energy systems to people, because that would destroy their monopoly.
[01:18:56.198 --> 01:19:00.541]  See, they don't have full government yet, full world government yet, to carry their plans out.
[01:19:00.842 --> 01:19:07.186]  They argue, well, if they could get all this in, and take out their competition, that then they could try to fix things.
[01:19:07.387 --> 01:19:09.788]  But their plan to fix things is just to kill everybody.
[01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:12.851]  And then I study the individual globalists and how they operate,
[01:19:13.817 --> 01:19:23.123]  They're all just a bunch of sadists murdering control freaks who love going to dinners every night in white ties being given awards and worshipped and wearing crowns on their heads.
[01:19:23.463 --> 01:19:39.853]  Psychopathic, narcissistic, control freak, sociopath, you know, mixtures of all sorts of control freak weirdos combining into these army command groups commanding giant slurs of dumbed down
[01:19:40.794 --> 01:19:48.222]  Populations programmed by Madison Avenue to be grasping spiritually blind jibberwockies.

[01:22:02.174 --> 01:22:06.516]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:06.636 --> 01:22:12.278]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:12.378 --> 01:22:15.720]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:23:05.048 --> 01:23:07.169]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:16.415]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:17.036 --> 01:23:21.959]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.923]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:08.624 --> 01:24:10.885]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:13.386 --> 01:24:19.710]  Alright, we're gonna go to a David Knight report on what's happening with Syria.
[01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:26.394]  And if you're a new listener and hear these things I'm talking about and it is shocking to you,
[01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:33.572]  I know reality's crazy, but if you look at what other rulers and emperors have done, that's all crazy.
[01:24:34.272 --> 01:24:55.418]  That we're in 2013, the world is a bizarre place, our government is funding Al-Qaeda, our government has been overrun and seized by the globalists, they are trying to teach 5th graders about incredibly sexually graphic things in public schools, MSNBC is saying that the state's going to take over your children and that's a good thing.
[01:24:55.998 --> 01:24:57.599]  All of this craziness is really happening.
[01:25:00.316 --> 01:25:05.341]  They're just normalizing you for the change to absolutely flip everything on its head.
[01:25:05.381 --> 01:25:12.708]  This is a war against humanity by a globalist technocracy that believes that they're a different species than us.
[01:25:12.748 --> 01:25:13.669]  They say that in their own words.
[01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:15.691]  That they're really human and we're not.
[01:25:15.711 --> 01:25:17.753]  And they see us as animals to be fed on.
[01:25:18.134 --> 01:25:19.835]  Let's go to David Knight's report.
[01:25:21.457 --> 01:25:22.278]  Hypocrisy.
[01:25:22.819 --> 01:25:32.453]  This is about the large-scale indiscriminate use of weapons that the civilized world long ago decided must never be used at all.
[01:25:32.834 --> 01:25:37.260]  The supposed use of sarin gas in Syria is now being used as a pretext for war.
[01:25:37.881 --> 01:25:42.104]  But when did the civilized world decide that sarin gas shouldn't be used?
[01:25:42.665 --> 01:25:49.510]  And how different is sarin gas from the weapons of mass destruction that the civilized world wants to use on innocent Syrian civilians?
[01:25:49.931 --> 01:26:00.919]  Developed by the Nazis' own IG Farben, creators of Zyklon-B, used for mass murder in concentration camps, sarin gas was a standard chemical military weapon of both the US and the USSR.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:05.243]  And in the 1950s, it was adopted by NATO as a standard chemical weapon.
[01:26:05.939 --> 01:26:06.319]  The U.S.
[01:26:06.379 --> 01:26:10.201]  military industrial complex made a science out of sarin delivery.
[01:26:10.721 --> 01:26:15.903]  Pictured here is the M-134 bomblet, designed for the M-190 Honest John rocket warhead.
[01:26:16.183 --> 01:26:24.867]  The bomblets carried sarin nerve agent and were released 5,000 feet above their target, saturating an area 1,000 meters in diameter with sarin gas.
[01:26:25.387 --> 01:26:27.288]  Does Syria possess anything like that?
[01:26:27.868 --> 01:26:30.109]  But of course, it was okay because we had it.
[01:26:30.589 --> 01:26:33.130]  It defies any code of morality.
[01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:34.311]  Let me be clear.
[01:26:35.407 --> 01:26:44.454]  The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children, and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity.
[01:26:44.894 --> 01:26:48.757]  After using and weaponizing sarin gas for over 40 years, the U.S.
[01:26:49.017 --> 01:26:51.539]  signed a treaty in 1993 to ban its use.
[01:26:52.239 --> 01:26:55.802]  Five years later, CNN and Time Magazine both broke a story about the U.S.'
[01:26:55.742 --> 01:26:57.844]  's use of sarin gas during Vietnam.
[01:26:58.284 --> 01:27:03.208]  In the firestorm of controversy, CNN and Time fired the reporters and declared the story false.
[01:27:03.948 --> 01:27:12.332]  However, the reporters pushed back with a 77-page document backing up their allegations, and April Oliver won a $1 million lawsuit against CNN.
[01:27:12.813 --> 01:27:24.619]  But just the presence of sarin gas in Syria, regardless of whether it was used by the rebels, by the CIA and Jordanian commandos that Le Figaro reported entered Syria a couple of weeks earlier, or whether it was actually the Syrian government,
[01:27:25.439 --> 01:27:29.121]  The use of chemical weapons is supposed to be justification for the U.S.
[01:27:29.141 --> 01:27:36.986]  military-industrial complex to rain death down on tens or hundreds of times more innocent men, women, and children than were killed in this attack.
[01:27:37.346 --> 01:27:39.948]  But chemical weapons experts not affiliated with the U.S.
[01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:44.691]  government have cast doubt on whether sarin was actually the chemical used.
[01:27:44.711 --> 01:27:47.793]  500 times more toxic than cyanide, it can kill within one minute.
[01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:51.435]  And it will kill first responders who don't wear protective clothing.
[01:27:51.775 --> 01:27:56.158]  That this apparently didn't happen makes it doubtful that the chemical used was sarin.
[01:27:56.739 --> 01:27:59.380]  And how does sarin gas compare to weapons that the U.S.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.462]  has used and continues to use?
[01:28:01.842 --> 01:28:05.224]  Millions of gallons of Agent Orange were dropped in Vietnam during the war.
[01:28:05.885 --> 01:28:11.629]  Nearly 50 years later, three generations later, it is still showing up in horrible birth defects.
[01:28:12.492 --> 01:28:14.493]  And it didn't just affect Vietnamese civilians.
[01:28:14.833 --> 01:28:18.194]  American soldiers are dying from cancer and having difficulty getting the U.S.
[01:28:18.234 --> 01:28:22.756]  government to accept responsibility, having to fight one by one against the VA.
[01:28:23.276 --> 01:28:23.737]  And the U.S.
[01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:28.719]  continues to use weapons that would mean a slow death sentence for those who survived the war, both U.S.
[01:28:28.759 --> 01:28:30.379]  soldiers and foreign citizens.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.880]  That would be depleted uranium.
[01:28:33.221 --> 01:28:34.421]  At about the same time the U.S.
[01:28:34.461 --> 01:28:39.243]  agreed to ban the use of sarin gas, it reversed its policy and began exposing U.S.
[01:28:39.283 --> 01:28:40.824]  soldiers to depleted uranium.
[01:28:41.664 --> 01:28:47.452]  Like Agent Orange, it is also a persistent poison, killing slowly and causing birth defects.
[01:28:48.733 --> 01:28:58.446]  Our sense of basic humanity is offended, not only by this cowardly crime, but also by the cynical attempt to cover it up.
[01:28:58.971 --> 01:29:04.236]  The American government's hypocrisy over the use of weapons of mass destruction is a stench before heaven.
[01:29:04.637 --> 01:29:11.744]  That they would use this to justify the murder of tens of thousands more people is what should offend our sense of humanity.
[01:29:12.345 --> 01:29:14.407]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[01:29:15.609 --> 01:29:16.509]  You know, I want to say this.
[01:29:16.589 --> 01:29:22.971]  I get up on air, I'm aggressive, I'm angry, I'm focused sometimes, but God moves in mysterious ways.
[01:29:23.011 --> 01:29:30.634]  We've been able to build this media operation, but thank God I've got such amazing reporters and researchers like David Knight.
[01:29:31.514 --> 01:29:37.636]  And everybody else in my crew, thank God that we've gotten to this point and been able to build this operation to this point.
[01:29:37.656 --> 01:29:44.198]  And we're going to bring in even more reporters, more research, and to be able to put the truth out in the face of the globalists.
[01:29:44.218 --> 01:29:49.920]  So there is the Sharon hypocrisy, the West hypocrisy on Syria.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:54.081]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.001 --> 01:29:57.682]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.327 --> 01:30:09.630]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:13.871]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:10.745]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:31:10.985 --> 01:31:18.529]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:27.835]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:31:28.035 --> 01:31:35.017]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:31:35.177 --> 01:31:38.058]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:31:38.078 --> 01:31:44.020]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:45.420]  A war.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.501]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:31:46.541 --> 01:31:47.841]  Another plane just hit!
[01:32:01.387 --> 01:32:03.028]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:32:03.288 --> 01:32:06.790]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.

[01:33:08.838 --> 01:33:12.160]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:13.201 --> 01:33:20.226]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:20.826 --> 01:33:27.812]  Alright, I want to finish up with a couple of headlines on Syria.
[01:33:27.912 --> 01:33:31.815]  Israeli newspapers are reporting, and it's now been confirmed that the
[01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:33.910]  U.N.
[01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:50.300]  inspectors are being pulled out of the country on Saturday and then as soon as they're out of the country by helicopter back to the CIA command bases where Al Qaeda is based in Jordan and Iraq and other areas that they are going to start a cruise missile bombardment.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.541]  And that's what a lot of U.S.
[01:33:51.581 --> 01:33:52.181]  news is saying.
[01:33:52.681 --> 01:33:54.182]  I don't know if that's the case.
[01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:55.303]  I don't know if that's true.
[01:33:56.789 --> 01:34:08.979]  But if he does do that, this is clearly just a wag the dog, you know, tail wagging the dog case of where, remember Clinton fired like a hundred cruise missiles off at a aspirin factory?
[01:34:10.461 --> 01:34:20.029]  When the Drudge Report was exposing, I mean to show how these are just people were fighting, the Drudge Report was pointing out that Clinton had lied about Monica Lewinsky.
[01:34:20.959 --> 01:34:22.420]  And then Talk Radio picked up on it.
[01:34:22.741 --> 01:34:24.042]  I remember, I was covering it at the time.
[01:34:25.783 --> 01:34:34.611]  And they then freaked out and he missile attacked a pharmaceutical company factory saying it was a chemical weapons lab.
[01:34:34.631 --> 01:34:35.091]  Remember that?
[01:34:37.513 --> 01:34:40.576]  And that was in the middle of Africa.
[01:34:42.965 --> 01:34:48.706]  And then, they had also, what was it, Operation Fox, where they attacked Iraq with cruise missiles?
[01:34:49.346 --> 01:34:51.627]  I mean, this is the type of stuff they do.
[01:34:54.067 --> 01:35:00.789]  And then it also serves as, oh look, we are going to need to, you know, do something, because there'll be another attack.
[01:35:00.829 --> 01:35:02.009]  And this has been going on for years.
[01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:03.810]  Come on, we gotta have a strike.
[01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:06.010]  We gotta help the Syrian children.
[01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:10.431]  And the average American doesn't know that our government is hijacked, that our government staged it.
[01:35:11.761 --> 01:35:14.564]  And so, they think they'll go along with it.
[01:35:14.604 --> 01:35:18.087]  But the incredible news that I should be jumping for joy over.
[01:35:18.587 --> 01:35:20.269]  In fact, we should be popping champagne.
[01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:22.250]  I've only done this one other time here on air.
[01:35:23.431 --> 01:35:24.452]  That was four years ago.
[01:35:25.173 --> 01:35:25.934]  The Copenhagen
[01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:31.231]  Meeting to push a world government tax.
[01:35:31.691 --> 01:35:34.933]  The document came out and at the same time the hacked emails got released.
[01:35:35.013 --> 01:35:35.973]  They confirmed were real.
[01:35:36.334 --> 01:35:50.922]  Where the UN was organizing a lie to hide that the world was cooling and that they knew it was about global taxes and eugenics and cutting off the third world and not letting them develop and then shutting down development in the West as well but really targeting the third world and that it wasn't to help the third world.
[01:35:51.343 --> 01:35:52.443]  So everybody turned against it.
[01:35:52.784 --> 01:35:55.285]  I had the crew on that Sunday broadcast go get champagne.
[01:35:55.525 --> 01:35:56.566]  We drank champagne on the air.
[01:35:57.046 --> 01:35:58.147]  One time in 18 years.
[01:35:58.628 --> 01:36:17.926]  And I really just had the understanding that the fact that Americans, conservative, libertarian, liberal, whatever term they call themselves, have 9% approval rating for this is champagne level.
[01:36:19.568 --> 01:36:21.830]  I mean, regardless of what happens, it shows that
[01:36:24.795 --> 01:36:27.978]  People are really, really starting to get it.
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:31.601]  And it's incredibly positive.
[01:36:32.902 --> 01:36:34.804]  And there's a lot of other positive stuff happening.
[01:36:37.246 --> 01:36:44.372]  And I've talked to a lot of police and a lot of military, which are, again, where the rubber meets the road in the establishment, and they're waking up.
[01:36:45.153 --> 01:36:46.894]  And school teachers I talk to are waking up.
[01:36:47.094 --> 01:36:52.199]  The bureaucracy is waking up and really getting that this isn't all being done for our good.
[01:36:53.064 --> 01:37:03.248]  And they give us cover stories for why we're doing what we're doing, but in the final equation, it is to consolidate power by a bunch of above-the-law globalists, and people are tired of it.
[01:37:03.268 --> 01:37:03.568]  800-259-9231.
[01:37:04.128 --> 01:37:08.390]  I know the phone lines are loaded, but I wanted to give the number out.
[01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:09.050]  It's open phones.
[01:37:09.090 --> 01:37:10.651]  I kind of said on Syria, but I mentioned...
[01:37:11.531 --> 01:37:16.033]  Police earlier, how more and more cops are having their kids killed by cops.
[01:37:16.853 --> 01:37:19.975]  And I've noticed a trend where when that happens, the cops actually get charged.
[01:37:20.735 --> 01:37:28.578]  So I was talking about how that's almost the new royalty and how all over the country, the police and bureaucrats, the face scanning cameras can't identify them.
[01:37:28.958 --> 01:37:30.859]  The license plate readers can't identify them.
[01:37:31.999 --> 01:37:36.461]  The systems can't, and they can't really be given tickets now it's coming out.
[01:37:37.262 --> 01:37:40.243]  You can't even enter their info in the police computers in California.
[01:37:41.206 --> 01:37:46.169]  And last time I checked it was almost a million in the San Francisco Chronicle, was asking, is this a bad idea?
[01:37:46.410 --> 01:37:50.933]  And now it's reached epic proportions a few weeks ago I was reading, where it's just insane.
[01:37:51.533 --> 01:37:57.517]  And can you imagine if the bureaucrats are above the law, can you imagine the mega bankers and everybody else?
[01:37:57.937 --> 01:37:59.058]  This is lawlessness.
[01:37:59.479 --> 01:38:04.222]  And the only thing holding things back right now is the morality of individuals that's left.
[01:38:04.502 --> 01:38:06.744]  And that's why the system assaults morality.
[01:38:07.084 --> 01:38:08.445]  If you go read Declassified,
[01:38:10.148 --> 01:38:12.010]  This stuff came out in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.
[01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:14.153]  Different, you know, famous communist goals and agenda.
[01:38:14.173 --> 01:38:17.176]  You can just search that term and see different ones right in the congressional record.
[01:38:17.536 --> 01:38:22.903]  And then about a decade ago, they began to release the KGB and NKVD files.
[01:38:22.923 --> 01:38:28.128]  There were lots of headlines like, McCarthy was right and stuff like that about communist infiltration.
[01:38:29.216 --> 01:38:40.312]  And in those, it says we want to get people having sex at a young age so they don't have a family and never, you know, cement a bond because a family is a threat for our collectivist state system.
[01:38:41.683 --> 01:38:43.204]  We want to get people on drugs.
[01:38:43.244 --> 01:38:46.965]  We want to, you know, on and on and on, turn groups against each other.
[01:38:46.985 --> 01:38:48.125]  We don't want people going to church.
[01:38:48.906 --> 01:38:56.548]  But we want to push atheist ideas, but also simultaneously infiltrate the churches as atheists to then put out our message.
[01:38:56.588 --> 01:38:58.529]  And it's just unbelievable.
[01:38:59.029 --> 01:39:00.830]  And they infiltrated the Catholics, folks.
[01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:03.511]  That's what's going on there with all that craziness.
[01:39:03.851 --> 01:39:06.132]  They infiltrated the Protestants, you name it.
[01:39:07.052 --> 01:39:11.497]  And now, at Baptist churches, they're saying, turn in your guns.
[01:39:12.358 --> 01:39:13.960]  The Southern Baptist Convention and others.
[01:39:15.662 --> 01:39:16.523]  War is good.
[01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:17.885]  Do what the government says.
[01:39:18.846 --> 01:39:19.627]  Take the shots.
[01:39:19.667 --> 01:39:20.788]  They're a clergy response team.
[01:39:21.028 --> 01:39:22.150]  It's a state-run system.
[01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:23.491]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:39:24.392 --> 01:39:24.853]  It's just that...
[01:39:26.138 --> 01:39:35.924]  There are so many things going on, so many incredible things that are happening, and it shows how this program and how the public schools have been able to do this.
[01:39:36.344 --> 01:39:38.666]  And now they federalize with standardization.
[01:39:38.946 --> 01:39:45.450]  If you want to be accredited to go to college, the private schools, most of them, over 90%.
[01:39:46.190 --> 01:39:49.993]  Folks, you're not going to go to college and get a job unless it's as a bureaucrat or Homeland Security.
[01:39:51.438 --> 01:39:53.201]  I mean, it's over.
[01:39:53.261 --> 01:39:54.483]  There's not going to be jobs.
[01:39:55.043 --> 01:39:55.944]  America's done.
[01:39:55.965 --> 01:40:07.220]  You go spend a half million dollars on all the loans you take, you know, a quarter million to get a four-year degree, half a million to get a PhD or a medical doctorate,
[01:40:08.693 --> 01:40:13.215]  And all the metrics show, maybe 5% will end up making money with it.
[01:40:13.435 --> 01:40:14.016]  It's over!
[01:40:14.676 --> 01:40:15.256]  It's over!
[01:40:15.716 --> 01:40:17.337]  If the New World Order is allowed to continue.
[01:40:17.557 --> 01:40:18.058]  It's done.
[01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:19.378]  It's all a fraud.
[01:40:20.019 --> 01:40:21.799]  It doesn't even matter if your kids go to school now.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:29.823]  As long as they know about the New World Order, know how to read and write, and know how to fix a toilet, mow a yard, and have good interpersonal skills, so people learn they're honorable.
[01:40:30.043 --> 01:40:34.906]  That's the most valuable thing in business and life, is people knowing you do what you say you're going to do.
[01:40:35.626 --> 01:40:37.467]  People knowing you don't stab people in the back.
[01:40:37.687 --> 01:40:39.308]  People knowing you're a good person.
[01:40:39.569 --> 01:40:40.969]  People knowing you're hardworking.
[01:40:41.330 --> 01:41:00.762]  That was always the most valuable thing, and that is the most valuable thing today, more than ever, as society falls apart, as everybody wants to be a movie star, everybody wants to be a rock star, because they think that, narcissistically, they're going to be successful if they could just pass into the promised land and be some type of celebrity.
[01:41:00.962 --> 01:41:04.564]  I'm here to tell you, folks, I know a lot of big celebrities, bigger than Charlie Sheen.
[01:41:05.643 --> 01:41:07.484]  Bigger than a lot of the ones you've heard on this show.
[01:41:08.204 --> 01:41:09.564]  Bigger than Viggo Mortensen.
[01:41:09.604 --> 01:41:11.125]  Bigger than... you name it.
[01:41:11.445 --> 01:41:12.806]  As big as it gets, folks.
[01:41:12.886 --> 01:41:20.989]  And they are the most unhappy, miserable, mentally ill, looking at themselves in the mirror all day people that you could imagine.
[01:41:21.009 --> 01:41:22.069]  I'm not talking about Charlie.
[01:41:22.089 --> 01:41:24.770]  Until he went off the rails, he was a really smart, great guy.
[01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:25.550]  He's still a good guy.
[01:41:25.871 --> 01:41:26.471]  We pray for him.
[01:41:27.142 --> 01:41:28.263]  And his family does as well.
[01:41:28.323 --> 01:41:30.805]  The point is, is that there is nothing else.
[01:41:31.566 --> 01:41:32.347]  Let me tell you what there is.
[01:41:32.367 --> 01:41:40.274]  There's your kids growing up healthy and happy and being successful and having children and continuing and being decent people who have a good family name.
[01:41:40.814 --> 01:41:52.825]  Having children and them being members of society that stand for good, that is total societal, cultural and biological success.
[01:41:53.165 --> 01:41:53.866]  That is it.
[01:41:55.037 --> 01:41:58.318]  Not being invaded, not being overrun, not being a slave.
[01:41:58.678 --> 01:42:01.420]  That is always the great goal, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:03.000]  To go be the yeoman farmer.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.341]  That's why they all wanted to leave Washington and go be farmers.
[01:42:05.721 --> 01:42:10.563]  Out on their cool farms and out there with the bees flying around and out there hunting.
[01:42:10.923 --> 01:42:19.026]  Because they were real men that had been in wars and sailed the seas and spoke five languages and were into being what it really is to be human.
[01:42:19.267 --> 01:42:19.687]  And they said,
[01:42:20.587 --> 01:42:22.428]  And the Councils of Government is a joke!
[01:42:22.728 --> 01:42:30.071]  Henry Kissinger and his stupid, you know, consort going into events dressed up in tuxedos, they're a joke!
[01:42:30.511 --> 01:42:32.792]  But we let these jokes run our world!
[01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:38.174]  By teaching us we're inadequate and they're up there on some platform!
[01:42:39.334 --> 01:42:48.198]  Let me tell you, if you have brains, if you're an artist, if you're a charming, handsome, loving man, if you're a charming, beautiful woman,
[01:42:50.168 --> 01:42:53.370]  Well, the beauty isn't just the beauty of how you look.
[01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:55.231]  It's who you are.
[01:42:56.112 --> 01:42:57.553]  That is incredibly valuable.
[01:42:57.833 --> 01:42:59.894]  You already have everything!
[01:43:00.614 --> 01:43:06.098]  You're already, as I've said, on a planet in space with unbelievable creations all around.
[01:43:06.118 --> 01:43:07.619]  In fact, I sent this to Watson the Post.
[01:43:07.639 --> 01:43:08.359]  I don't think he did.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.800]  He's been so busy.
[01:43:11.982 --> 01:43:14.283]  My wife came in this morning at like 6 a.m.
[01:43:14.583 --> 01:43:14.943]  We got up.
[01:43:14.963 --> 01:43:16.264]  She goes, look at this I found.
[01:43:16.805 --> 01:43:18.906]  This is radio telescopes and other systems.
[01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:22.465]  Recording the space winds.
[01:43:23.246 --> 01:43:25.948]  And they don't know because the winds shouldn't be making these sounds.
[01:43:26.288 --> 01:43:29.590]  And it's really radio waves and other things combined.
[01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:30.951]  It sounds like whale song.
[01:43:31.351 --> 01:43:32.792]  And here's what the earth sounds like.
[01:43:33.073 --> 01:43:34.374]  Here's what Jupiter sounds like.
[01:43:34.714 --> 01:43:37.055]  Here's what the moon sounds like.
[01:43:37.095 --> 01:43:38.516]  And it's so beautiful sounding.
[01:43:38.817 --> 01:43:40.298]  I want to play some of that on the show.
[01:43:40.578 --> 01:43:41.418]  I have it on my phone.
[01:43:41.478 --> 01:43:42.419]  I texted it to watch it.
[01:43:42.439 --> 01:43:44.340]  You can pull off the URL off my phone.
[01:43:44.581 --> 01:43:49.104]  I want to play that because you just hear that and it's just like, oh my goodness.
[01:43:49.764 --> 01:43:51.209]  I mean, we're part of that, folks.
[01:43:51.571 --> 01:43:53.216]  We're not... I want to go to space.
[01:43:53.256 --> 01:43:54.461]  I want to go to another planet.
[01:43:54.501 --> 01:43:55.404]  You're on a planet!
[01:43:57.026 --> 01:43:58.287]  I mean, it's just fantastical.
[01:43:58.307 --> 01:44:00.168]  And then we're ruled.
[01:44:00.188 --> 01:44:03.349]  I mean, I watch Obama get off a helicopter and all walking slick.
[01:44:03.389 --> 01:44:07.411]  And I've watched the body language of him at basketball games, really getting off and everybody looking at him.
[01:44:07.671 --> 01:44:10.453]  It's like an embarrassing, narcissistic display.
[01:44:10.973 --> 01:44:12.694]  And all the people around him getting off on it.
[01:44:13.454 --> 01:44:14.915]  And I was never that narcissistic.
[01:44:14.935 --> 01:44:16.376]  When I was a teenager, I was a little bit.
[01:44:16.396 --> 01:44:17.016]  That's natural.
[01:44:17.036 --> 01:44:18.317]  You're supposed to grow out of it.
[01:44:18.557 --> 01:44:20.298]  But I mean, I've been at the coolest parties.
[01:44:20.338 --> 01:44:21.538]  I've been at the best events.
[01:44:21.999 --> 01:44:22.799]  And it's nothing.
[01:44:23.279 --> 01:44:26.121]  But you see other people sitting back
[01:44:27.324 --> 01:44:30.067]  Feeling good that they're the parrot sitting the tallest in the tree.
[01:44:30.267 --> 01:44:35.193]  That's what cockatoos do out in Australia is they fight over the dominant one with hundreds of them.
[01:44:35.533 --> 01:44:37.115]  Who can be in the top of the tree?
[01:44:38.276 --> 01:44:41.259]  Who can be up there and they just sit there just so proud?
[01:44:42.239 --> 01:44:43.020]  Monkeys do this.
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:44.101]  Gorillas do it.
[01:44:44.561 --> 01:44:50.187]  The chimpanzees, the other great apes, they get up high and they'll sit on a hill, everyone bowing to them.
[01:44:50.887 --> 01:44:52.970]  I mean, look, I want to space travel.
[01:44:54.671 --> 01:44:55.312]  My progeny.
[01:44:55.472 --> 01:44:56.493]  I want to go to the next level.
[01:44:56.733 --> 01:44:59.156]  I don't want to just pose up on the top of a hill.
[01:44:59.276 --> 01:45:00.297]  Hey, I'm the big monkey!
[01:45:01.584 --> 01:45:05.869]  George W. Bush, you know, the famous pictures of him looking just like a chimpanzee with the faces he would make.
[01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:08.391]  You know, getting off on the crowds, getting off on the power.
[01:45:08.612 --> 01:45:10.374]  And he wasn't probably even that narcissistic.
[01:45:10.694 --> 01:45:12.416]  More probably a control freak psychopath.
[01:45:14.218 --> 01:45:15.880]  At least if you look at the stuff he was involved in.
[01:45:16.823 --> 01:45:21.367]  If you judge a tree by its fruits, but I mean, you look at all this and it's like a joke!
[01:45:22.047 --> 01:45:29.454]  And these guys want to be in the Situation Room and want to call the orders to bomb countries and want to be the slick guys who, you know, get saluted by.
[01:45:29.474 --> 01:45:38.441]  It'd be embarrassing to walk on a red carpet and have military people saluting you and George Washington wouldn't let them call him His Excellency or this or that.
[01:45:38.822 --> 01:45:40.283]  I mean, it's just disgusting!
[01:45:40.303 --> 01:45:42.265]  It is disgusting!
[01:45:43.524 --> 01:45:44.545]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:45:44.745 --> 01:45:46.606]  And you people are going to blow the planet up!
[01:45:46.666 --> 01:45:47.347]  I'm telling you!
[01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:49.148]  You're losers, New World Order!
[01:45:49.368 --> 01:45:50.829]  You're disgusting filth!
[01:45:50.850 --> 01:45:58.055]  And they always talk about all the horrible things that are happening and you go research it.
[01:45:58.335 --> 01:46:02.318]  They then hijack anything bad happening to make it even worse and get power out of it.
[01:46:02.358 --> 01:46:03.139]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:46:03.439 --> 01:46:04.360]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.100]  I know I've been ranting.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.441]  We'll get to you here in a moment.
[01:46:06.461 --> 01:46:10.945]  We'll get to Leanne McAdoo's report in front of George Washington's statue at UT.
[01:46:13.291 --> 01:46:14.232]  She shot like an hour of this.
[01:46:14.252 --> 01:46:15.333]  I was watching it last night.
[01:46:18.275 --> 01:46:19.436]  And the report's up on Infowars.com.
[01:46:19.476 --> 01:46:20.897]  It's just a short snippet out of it.
[01:46:21.518 --> 01:46:23.600]  But I had her actually go shoot it for Obama Deception, too.
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:29.124]  And in front of George Washington, a big 20-foot statue.
[01:46:29.184 --> 01:46:33.968]  People sign a thing to ban free speech, ban father and mother, and ban brown bags.
[01:46:35.529 --> 01:46:38.032]  And arrest or fine people that use brown bags.
[01:46:39.164 --> 01:46:42.867]  And man, when these, especially women, when they hear this, they get excited.
[01:46:42.887 --> 01:46:43.747]  They go, yeah!
[01:46:44.428 --> 01:46:45.088]  Yeah!
[01:46:45.108 --> 01:46:47.410]  Because deep down, that's power!
[01:46:48.311 --> 01:46:49.892]  To arrest people who aren't nice!
[01:46:51.133 --> 01:46:54.215]  I mean, boy, let me tell you, these are not liberals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:54.235 --> 01:46:56.597]  These are screwed up, dangerous people.
[01:46:58.398 --> 01:47:02.161]  And I know conservatives, when they get whipped up for their little fake words and stuff, act very similar.
[01:47:02.641 --> 01:47:03.962]  Man, I tell you, woo!
[01:47:04.643 --> 01:47:05.824]  I tell you, it is scary!
[01:47:06.504 --> 01:47:07.365]  It is scary!
[01:47:09.170 --> 01:47:16.495]  It is very, very, very, very scary to know that they've got the evil forces they need to disappear a lot of us.
[01:47:16.535 --> 01:47:23.179]  And these people will sit back and we'll salute it because it feels powerful to be part of darkness.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:27.742]  It feels good at a spiritual level to them because they're so spiritually blind.
[01:47:28.242 --> 01:47:29.523]  All they've got is evil.
[01:47:29.923 --> 01:47:36.428]  And so as they get towards more deeper evil, they feel the power because they're so powerless that even though evil is a much,
[01:47:37.148 --> 01:47:39.611]  Resonates is a much less powerful thing than good.
[01:47:40.131 --> 01:47:41.012]  They're so weak.
[01:47:41.272 --> 01:47:43.074]  That's all that's ever been projected at them.
[01:47:43.655 --> 01:47:44.996]  And it's also coated in good.
[01:47:45.016 --> 01:47:49.621]  So on the surface of their mind, they're like, it's good, but they'll like bite their lip and get twinkles in their eye.
[01:47:49.821 --> 01:47:51.903]  It's really like we were going to arrest people.
[01:47:52.744 --> 01:47:53.805]  And we're going to, you know.
[01:47:54.943 --> 01:47:56.404]  Those are our F-16s now.
[01:47:56.464 --> 01:47:57.786]  That's our armored vehicles.
[01:47:57.826 --> 01:47:59.007]  Those are our SWAT teams now.
[01:47:59.407 --> 01:48:00.648]  Those are our cruise missiles now.
[01:48:00.668 --> 01:48:04.932]  We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna take over the economy.
[01:48:04.952 --> 01:48:06.333]  We're gonna, we're gonna have people under us.
[01:48:06.373 --> 01:48:07.895]  We're gonna, we're gonna run things.
[01:48:07.955 --> 01:48:09.456]  It's the time for the women to rise.
[01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:11.859]  It's time for the, it's time for our time.
[01:48:11.919 --> 01:48:14.521]  It's time for, I mean, it's exactly what the Bible talks about.
[01:48:14.561 --> 01:48:18.485]  Your children and your women will be set up above you and will serve the state.
[01:48:18.765 --> 01:48:19.686]  The state is the man.
[01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:25.479]  And the women and the children are the state's woman and child.
[01:48:25.499 --> 01:48:26.361]  Hitler even said this.
[01:48:26.721 --> 01:48:30.987]  And the men are animals to be kept in the barn and to not be taught how to read or write.
[01:48:31.427 --> 01:48:33.430]  That's why they put the boys on the Ritalin and dumb them down.
[01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:34.311]  It's all the same thing.
[01:48:34.651 --> 01:48:35.412]  Roman program.
[01:48:36.263 --> 01:48:37.123]  Roman program.
[01:48:37.223 --> 01:48:40.984]  Roman program for occupied areas where they would keep the men in barns and not let them learn how to talk.
[01:48:41.284 --> 01:48:44.805]  Oh, you just thought when the Civil Rights Movement teaches you about that, that that was just for America?
[01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:47.526]  Those were Latin slave manuals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:47.786 --> 01:48:54.268]  Feminism, all of it, is the women delivering their children to the state to be their slaves and to be their Hessian mercenaries.
[01:48:54.568 --> 01:49:00.329]  We're going to go to break and come back with your calls for 20 minutes in the next hour, I promise, and then next segment we'll get to you in this hour.

[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:54.961]  For the love of clean water.
[01:53:55.121 --> 01:53:57.142]  I read the news today.
[01:54:15.979 --> 01:54:18.320]  I'm going to start taking your phone calls right now.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:23.641]  If you joined us, it's up on InfoWars.com with links to the Israeli newspapers.
[01:54:23.981 --> 01:54:26.981]  They are saying the attack is on for Saturday.
[01:54:28.642 --> 01:54:37.304]  I don't know if that's going to be true or not, but I hope that that is not the case because it could lead to some really bad things happening.
[01:54:37.844 --> 01:54:40.204]  Also, I saw this a few days ago and I'm going to cover it after I go to calls.
[01:54:40.624 --> 01:54:43.485]  California trying to strike out tax-exempt status.
[01:54:44.755 --> 01:54:46.816]  For Little League discriminatory groups.
[01:54:47.777 --> 01:54:51.779]  Because if Little League is for boys and girls, Little League is for girls.
[01:54:52.099 --> 01:54:58.703]  Again, the existence of boys and girls is mean.
[01:54:59.244 --> 01:55:01.105]  Just because you're different, that makes people feel bad.
[01:55:02.205 --> 01:55:03.967]  It's the opposite of tolerance.
[01:55:04.047 --> 01:55:08.129]  It's authoritarianism called tolerance.
[01:55:08.829 --> 01:55:09.910]  They're not going to stop, folks.
[01:55:09.930 --> 01:55:11.111]  They're going to take over everything.
[01:55:12.465 --> 01:55:14.626]  Hi Alex, I wanted to talk to you about some police harassment I went through.
[01:55:41.756 --> 01:56:01.578]  Um, when I first started, uh, driving, uh, pretty much I've gone through, um, I went through a stop sign at one point that a police officer pulled me over, asked me for my driver's license, gave it to him, uh, and, uh, asked me to step out of the vehicle because, you know, I look Hispanic, so he stereotyped me.
[01:56:02.518 --> 01:56:03.779]  I don't know, man.
[01:56:03.939 --> 01:56:06.562]  I've been with people in Chicago that got pulled over who were all white.
[01:56:07.102 --> 01:56:08.623]  Chicago, they pull over a lot.
[01:56:08.763 --> 01:56:11.986]  They have, like, quote, safe zones where the kids even get shot down.
[01:56:12.006 --> 01:56:16.010]  They want, quote, drones, they said yesterday, hovering to keep the children safe.
[01:56:16.590 --> 01:56:18.872]  I mean, Chicago, in many areas, as you know, is a war zone.
[01:56:18.892 --> 01:56:23.816]  I'm not saying you didn't get profiled because you're tall, dark, and handsome or whatever it is.
[01:56:24.597 --> 01:56:34.941]  But, I mean, I'm telling you, I think more and more, like, the police pull over blondes and do cavity searches on the side of the road in Texas, and they pull over black ladies and do it.
[01:56:35.281 --> 01:56:38.422]  I mean, that just, more and more, we're all targets, but go ahead.
[01:56:40.163 --> 01:56:51.227]  Yeah, I, actually, a couple years after that, I was coming back from work with a buddy of mine, and I got pulled over by the same cop, and he had, I was wearing a,
[01:56:52.591 --> 01:56:53.411]  Like a tank top.
[01:56:53.731 --> 01:56:55.652]  And I have a couple of tattoos.
[01:56:55.812 --> 01:56:57.272]  A couple of political tattoos.
[01:56:57.433 --> 01:56:59.913]  I have the, uh, don't tread on me on my arm.
[01:56:59.953 --> 01:57:02.154]  Now they do teach him to discriminate against patriots.
[01:57:02.214 --> 01:57:02.614]  Oh, now.
[01:57:02.814 --> 01:57:03.454]  Oh, I understand.
[01:57:03.474 --> 01:57:03.855]  Go ahead.
[01:57:04.135 --> 01:57:04.915]  Yeah, but don't tread on me.
[01:57:04.955 --> 01:57:05.455]  Very evil.
[01:57:06.755 --> 01:57:09.236]  Yeah, I've got the 1776 on my wrist.
[01:57:09.336 --> 01:57:16.879]  I have, uh, two flags that are, um, that are flipped over for the distress that's happening in my country.
[01:57:17.919 --> 01:57:21.020]  And, um, he kind of like, he kind of just moved over and looked at me.
[01:57:21.727 --> 01:57:22.527]  You're joking.
[01:57:42.898 --> 01:57:57.564]  Well, I've never... Listen, in the new manuals they say, the new army manual says, the Founding Fathers would not be welcome in the military, and that promoting liberty and a better world, that's an actual quote, is connected to terrorism, and that's the code words we use.
[01:57:58.104 --> 01:58:04.386]  And a lot of these cops just want to imagine everybody's bad because it makes them be on a power trip, but that guy must be really stupid.
[01:58:04.406 --> 01:58:05.187]  So how did this end?
[01:58:07.648 --> 01:58:08.088]  This end?
[01:58:09.338 --> 01:58:09.999]  You're joking.
[01:58:16.778 --> 01:58:17.419]  I'm not joking.
[01:58:17.439 --> 01:58:18.940]  He told me to put on a sweatshirt.
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:19.820]  Well, let me say this.
[01:58:19.881 --> 01:58:21.402]  We've been researching dashcams.
[01:58:21.442 --> 01:58:22.743]  We also need ways to fund ourselves.
[01:58:23.303 --> 01:58:28.167]  But we're going to be coming out with our own dashcams soon that are the very best out there for the price.
[01:58:28.467 --> 01:58:31.590]  And I'm buying a giant group of them in bulk to give you a low price.
[01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:34.252]  Because I want every one of my loosers to have dashcams.
[01:58:34.993 --> 01:58:38.916]  But let me tell you, the cops come over and you got a dashcam, they're going to behave themselves.
[01:58:42.318 --> 01:58:44.020]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:18.569 --> 02:00:22.651]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.152 --> 02:00:30.433]  Already into the third hour here, coming up in about 20 minutes.
[02:00:31.273 --> 02:00:34.314]  We have a man who had his guns confiscated, and they're saying they're illegal.
[02:00:34.434 --> 02:00:36.134]  When I looked it up, on record they're not.
[02:00:36.675 --> 02:00:37.815]  He popped in on the Sunday show.
[02:00:37.835 --> 02:00:40.535]  I wanted to have him back on to tell his story and take your phone calls.
[02:00:40.915 --> 02:00:41.976]  What you think he ought to do.
[02:00:42.496 --> 02:00:44.096]  But right now we're going back to your phone calls.
[02:00:44.136 --> 02:00:44.896]  Thank you for holding.
[02:00:44.916 --> 02:00:49.097]  We're going to go to David, then we're going to go to Haboo, and then we're going to go to uh...
[02:00:50.234 --> 02:00:52.014]  Secrets, and then Tracy and others.
[02:00:52.755 --> 02:00:53.575]  Let's go to David.
[02:00:53.595 --> 02:00:54.115]  You're on the air.
[02:00:54.155 --> 02:00:54.595]  Thank you, sir.
[02:00:56.196 --> 02:00:57.496]  Alex, how you doing, my brother?
[02:00:57.736 --> 02:00:58.496]  Pretty good, my friend.
[02:00:59.576 --> 02:01:01.497]  Okay, here's the news now.
[02:01:01.597 --> 02:01:06.278]  I'm calling from the home of the state-controlled Bible Belt right here in Columbia, South Carolina.
[02:01:06.758 --> 02:01:08.779]  They recently just passed a law.
[02:01:08.819 --> 02:01:09.979]  They made it a law.
[02:01:10.039 --> 02:01:14.800]  It is criminal in the city of Columbia, South Carolina, to be homeless.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.141]  And they are actually arresting the homeless
[02:01:17.882 --> 02:01:20.684]  And shipping them to encampment centers.
[02:01:21.284 --> 02:01:24.626]  Yeah, I actually heard about that on the news a few weeks ago and then forgot to cover it.
[02:01:24.666 --> 02:01:30.330]  Guys, will you print South Carolina City bans homeless?
[02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:38.254]  And California's done that to a certain extent in a few areas too, where they basically lock you up at night like they would do in the poor houses in England.
[02:01:38.274 --> 02:01:38.735]  And here's the deal.
[02:01:39.215 --> 02:01:41.398]  They've dumped everybody out of the mental institutions.
[02:01:41.738 --> 02:01:42.779]  There's a lot of drug addicts.
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.441]  I feel sorry for most homeless.
[02:01:44.601 --> 02:01:46.263]  A lot of them are street rats.
[02:01:46.744 --> 02:01:50.968]  They're just runaways, which a lot of them, some of them are nice, a lot of them are really nasty.
[02:01:51.269 --> 02:01:53.711]  That's the group that you gotta watch, you know, the 20-year-old or so.
[02:01:54.592 --> 02:02:00.436]  People out there that get really pushy and have killed people here in Austin and raped, you name it.
[02:02:00.957 --> 02:02:07.161]  And they're trying to build a homeless statue to the homeless here in Austin to kind of celebrate that.
[02:02:09.062 --> 02:02:12.464]  But at the same time, banning them is a violation
[02:02:13.442 --> 02:02:18.626]  Well, my take on it is they're actually shipping them out of Columbia to a disclosed encampment center.
[02:02:18.646 --> 02:02:20.507]  I mean, this is stated in an article on the Huffington Post.
[02:02:43.448 --> 02:02:45.229]  Amazing.
[02:02:45.249 --> 02:02:46.650]  Give us the headline, because that's big.
[02:02:46.710 --> 02:02:59.615]  If they're making them go there, that's the beginning of the camps, and it's what the Emergency Centers Establishment Act says they would condition people, because at first it'll just be poor people, and then it'll be everybody.
[02:02:59.635 --> 02:03:06.018]  The headline is Columbia, South Carolina criminalizes homelessness and unanimous vote.
[02:03:06.038 --> 02:03:06.959]  Now here's the funny thing.
[02:03:07.299 --> 02:03:09.240]  I want to call scum out for scum.
[02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:15.032]  Okay, Councilman Cameron Runyon professes to be a Christian.
[02:03:15.452 --> 02:03:19.394]  He is the one that came up with this, and they passed it.
[02:03:19.414 --> 02:03:22.415]  It was a unanimous vote of seven people.
[02:03:22.475 --> 02:03:27.557]  He professes to be a Christian, and Jesus Christ was a homeless man, when you think about it.
[02:03:27.577 --> 02:03:28.417]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:03:28.877 --> 02:03:30.838]  And as things get bad, there will be refugees.
[02:03:31.378 --> 02:03:35.180]  Others collapse like grapes of wrath, and we don't want to throw them all in FEMA camps.
[02:03:36.841 --> 02:03:39.263]  And, sir, we just found the article and the newscast.
[02:03:40.484 --> 02:03:41.826]  I am just speechless right now.
[02:03:41.846 --> 02:03:47.571]  I had heard about them banning homelessness, but I thought they'd kick them out of the town, which is just terrible.
[02:03:48.172 --> 02:03:55.098]  But you're telling me that, wow, here it is, yeah, they're going to ship them and make them stay there.
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:59.002]  But they'll be given the option to go to that.
[02:04:00.536 --> 02:04:04.157]  Or they'll be basically thrown out on the street somewhere else.
[02:04:04.457 --> 02:04:06.557]  But that's one step away from making them go.
[02:04:07.637 --> 02:04:07.837]  Yeah.
[02:04:08.057 --> 02:04:09.558]  These people are so sick.
[02:04:09.998 --> 02:04:12.778]  I mean, state, federal, world level.
[02:04:13.779 --> 02:04:18.019]  What you said earlier, you said something to the point of, it's just us people with morals.
[02:04:18.099 --> 02:04:19.920]  And that's it.
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:20.980]  And we're all spread out.
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:26.061]  We've got to come together as one and stand up against the new world order.
[02:04:26.821 --> 02:04:28.522]  No, no, I totally agree with you.
[02:04:28.622 --> 02:04:35.146]  And so many homeless people were taken as foster children, put on drugs, screwed up by that, and then they end up homeless.
[02:04:35.166 --> 02:04:40.289]  The state, on record, is one of the biggest producers of these vegetables that are out there on the street.
[02:04:40.309 --> 02:04:41.350]  That's the biggest group of them.
[02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:43.891]  Artificially created kind of schizophrenics.
[02:04:44.712 --> 02:04:45.572]  And it's terrible.
[02:04:46.132 --> 02:04:47.773]  Then you've got the predators out there.
[02:04:47.793 --> 02:04:51.556]  But your average drunk or your average mentally ill person, leave them alone.
[02:04:52.386 --> 02:04:59.264]  Now, some of the drag rats, the Rat Life people, they're out robbin' and stuff, and they better keep stay away from me.
[02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:04.755]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:05:04.995 --> 02:05:11.037]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:05:11.377 --> 02:05:17.799]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:05:18.159 --> 02:05:20.120]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:21.500]  They're the good guys.

[02:06:01.561 --> 02:06:06.123]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:06:06.283 --> 02:06:09.244]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:06:09.384 --> 02:06:14.626]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:06:14.946 --> 02:06:16.547]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:06:16.867 --> 02:06:18.208]  We are what we eat.
[02:06:18.528 --> 02:06:22.850]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:06:23.190 --> 02:06:27.172]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.

[02:08:07.025 --> 02:08:12.609]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.630]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:14.430 --> 02:08:21.335]  Infowars.com.
[02:08:21.615 --> 02:08:27.880]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.243 --> 02:08:36.824]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are into hour number three.
[02:08:36.844 --> 02:08:42.526]  I am your faithful servant, Alex Jones, here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:08:42.766 --> 02:08:43.326]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:43.366 --> 02:08:43.766]  Central.
[02:08:44.286 --> 02:08:44.967]  Standard time.
[02:08:45.027 --> 02:08:48.648]  We come back at night, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWars at Nightly News.
[02:08:48.688 --> 02:08:49.728]  I'm going back to your calls.
[02:08:50.068 --> 02:08:52.689]  Then we have a guest joining us who had his guns confiscated.
[02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:56.490]  We'll open the phones up at that time on the Second Amendment issue and what you would do.
[02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:59.251]  And have you had your guns taken without them telling you why?
[02:09:00.251 --> 02:09:03.256]  In fact, that's specifically why I'm going to open the phones up after we go to this raft of calls.
[02:09:03.676 --> 02:09:10.526]  I have a couple other special reports I want to premiere here on the radio coming up in a few minutes.
[02:09:10.687 --> 02:09:15.253]  Leanne McAdoo went out and we had her in front of the George Washington Monument.
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:20.743]  Ask people, should we ban the names Mother and Father and fine people or arrest people?
[02:09:21.343 --> 02:09:22.804]  We've got like an hour of this, it looks like.
[02:09:22.824 --> 02:09:25.386]  I'm going to air just a few minutes of it, and it's all amazing.
[02:09:25.806 --> 02:09:36.033]  And the majority of people that I saw on the video last night said that they want to arrest or fine people that use the word Mother or Father.
[02:09:36.574 --> 02:09:38.755]  And if you use a brown bag, that is racist.
[02:09:40.977 --> 02:09:42.238]  As long as you say it's for Obama.
[02:09:43.218 --> 02:09:45.440]  So this is who we're dealing with, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:46.667 --> 02:09:50.368]  This is who we're dealing with, and this is what we're facing as a society.
[02:09:50.408 --> 02:09:51.408]  These are authoritarians.
[02:09:52.609 --> 02:09:55.329]  Haboo in Wisconsin talking about Syria.
[02:09:55.349 --> 02:10:01.491]  Oh, and if you just joined us, Israeli papers are reporting, it's up on Infowars.com, that report a U.S.
[02:10:01.531 --> 02:10:04.692]  attack on Syria to begin Saturday.
[02:10:04.992 --> 02:10:06.053]  Now that's a report out of Israel.
[02:10:06.093 --> 02:10:06.914]  We don't know if that's true.
[02:10:07.254 --> 02:10:13.040]  But they said before it came out in The Guardian that they would be pulling out the UN inspectors Saturday morning before the attack.
[02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:18.245]  Then that came out in The Guardian, Syrian crisis, UN inspectors to leave on Saturday, live updates.
[02:10:19.045 --> 02:10:27.533]  But there's so much international heat on this, so much evidence the rebels engaged in the chemical attack and that it was a false flag.
[02:10:28.354 --> 02:10:40.005]  A lot of people think that the thousands of, uh, Alawites and others they've been kidnapping off the roads and killing, that they probably took a group to a gymnasium and then gassed them, and then now they're paralyzed or dead, then they roll those out for the cameras.
[02:10:40.045 --> 02:10:40.846]  That's what it looks like.
[02:10:40.886 --> 02:10:48.033]  Because you don't respond minutes after and not get hurt yourself or killed, and they're dragging them around and responding supposedly right after.
[02:10:48.153 --> 02:10:49.134]  It looks very fake.
[02:10:49.534 --> 02:10:50.915]  That is, they nerve gas real people.
[02:10:51.661 --> 02:10:53.964]  But it looks like this was all overseen.
[02:10:53.984 --> 02:10:54.605]  Can you imagine?
[02:10:54.625 --> 02:10:56.648]  This is unbelievable.
[02:10:57.369 --> 02:10:59.291]  But let's go to Habu in Wisconsin.
[02:10:59.311 --> 02:10:59.692]  Go ahead.
[02:11:01.134 --> 02:11:02.436]  Well, thank you, Alex Jones.
[02:11:03.004 --> 02:11:19.373]  You know, you have stood so tall through this rush to bomb Syria because you have said convincingly, you believe it, and you've thoroughly debunked the reasons that these punks have given for going to war.
[02:11:19.393 --> 02:11:20.794]  But may I make two points, please?
[02:11:22.475 --> 02:11:22.995]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:23.015 --> 02:11:26.617]  One is, you know, if this bombing happens,
[02:11:27.297 --> 02:11:33.923]  Then what I can see happening down the road is the thing similar to the no-fly zone established in Iraq.
[02:11:34.323 --> 02:11:37.085]  It'll be anytime there's a gas attack, they'll bomb them.
[02:11:37.526 --> 02:11:41.669]  And that'll be the way they'll tie the hands of the Syrian regime.
[02:11:42.450 --> 02:11:43.250]  That's one point.
[02:11:43.290 --> 02:11:47.214]  And the second point is not much has been made about the Iran
[02:11:47.954 --> 02:11:51.296]  Syria Alliance, which goes back to the days of the Iran-Iraq War.
[02:11:52.117 --> 02:12:01.203]  And I'm wondering if Iran would risk it all by, you know, closing the Straits of Hormuz if Syria is attacked.
[02:12:01.543 --> 02:12:02.184]  What do you think?
[02:12:02.264 --> 02:12:03.365]  And thank you so very much.
[02:12:03.685 --> 02:12:05.446]  And may God bless you and your family.
[02:12:05.466 --> 02:12:06.587]  Well, thank you.
[02:12:06.647 --> 02:12:07.648]  God bless you and your family.
[02:12:07.668 --> 02:12:11.190]  We're all in this together for justice and common sense and logic.
[02:12:13.211 --> 02:12:16.097]  No, Iran's basically said they're going to shut straight over Moshe.
[02:12:16.497 --> 02:12:23.190]  They're going to sink a bunch of derelict hulks, oil tankers and stuff out there.
[02:12:24.529 --> 02:12:35.321]  And NATO in the West is very good at moving that stuff, but they're going to get missile attacks out of the mountainous hills above the straits once that happens.
[02:12:35.741 --> 02:12:45.852]  And the issue is, the reason nobody wants to go to war with Iran is that they are concerted, they fight, they're coordinated, and they don't mind a die.
[02:12:47.176 --> 02:12:50.797]  You've got the Danzig song, I don't mind the pain.
[02:12:51.697 --> 02:12:53.678]  The Persians don't mind dying.
[02:12:53.698 --> 02:12:58.340]  They've got movies like 300 where they're all devil worshippers and evil and the 300 Greeks defeat them.
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:00.180]  That's kind of put out as war propaganda.
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:05.602]  The 300 Greeks did defeat them because they held the small gap, which is an example of what small numbers can do.
[02:13:05.642 --> 02:13:14.785]  But the point is that over a million and a half with primitive weapons, they've now got advanced weapons, Iranians held off Saddam Hussein
[02:13:16.184 --> 02:13:18.965]  I think 300,000 Iraqis, they estimate, died in that, most of them troops.
[02:13:19.506 --> 02:13:20.586]  That was a big deal, folks.
[02:13:21.967 --> 02:13:24.468]  And Saddam did that under U.S.
[02:13:24.488 --> 02:13:25.108]  government orders.
[02:13:26.089 --> 02:13:27.669]  I mean, he was CIA trained.
[02:13:29.410 --> 02:13:31.831]  He was a CIA officer, not an asset.
[02:13:32.391 --> 02:13:34.132]  And that's all been declassified, by the way.
[02:13:34.152 --> 02:13:35.553]  It's just no one seems to know that.
[02:13:36.727 --> 02:13:37.868]  He ran the coup d'etat.
[02:13:37.888 --> 02:13:39.309]  They put him in power in 79.
[02:13:39.789 --> 02:13:43.331]  He tried to run coups before that, back in the late 50s, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:43.831 --> 02:13:46.753]  Saddam Hussein was, like, trained in the West the whole nine yards.
[02:13:47.314 --> 02:13:50.916]  That's why he wanted porno movie theaters and Playboy and rock and roll on the radio.
[02:13:51.556 --> 02:13:52.297]  He was secular.
[02:13:53.357 --> 02:13:56.379]  And then they make all these movies how bad he was, I mean, compared to other people over there.
[02:13:56.819 --> 02:14:00.742]  He represented an older policy, though, of trying to westernize things.
[02:14:00.762 --> 02:14:01.763]  Then they didn't want that anymore.
[02:14:01.783 --> 02:14:03.844]  They wanted to wreck everything by the 80s.
[02:14:04.104 --> 02:14:05.325]  They got him to attack Iran.
[02:14:07.062 --> 02:14:11.746]  That went on for seven years, uh, bankrupted Iraq, and they said, you gotta pay back the 40 billion now.
[02:14:11.766 --> 02:14:14.368]  And he said, wait, I got a deal, I don't have to pay this back.
[02:14:14.708 --> 02:14:15.529]  So he said, fine.
[02:14:16.609 --> 02:14:31.361]  So for, what, from like 1987 to 1990, when the Iran-Iraq war ended, he double pumped, and the Saudi Arabians got mad, gas went down to like 75 cents a gallon, and it was all over the news, you know, OPEC angry, Europe, you know, uh,
[02:14:33.745 --> 02:14:34.649]  Refinery's angry.
[02:14:34.689 --> 02:14:35.432]  Too much oil.
[02:14:35.512 --> 02:14:36.315]  Price too low.
[02:14:36.335 --> 02:14:39.307]  And Saddam's like, you said I gotta pay these bills back.
[02:14:43.066 --> 02:14:44.827]  So then they say, we've got a way for you to do it.
[02:14:44.967 --> 02:14:45.347]  You're right.
[02:14:45.588 --> 02:14:53.653]  He goes, my point is Kuwait, this all came out, by the way, with April Gillespie in the full text of the meetings, there's clips of the famous thing of, will you not get involved in inter-Arab affairs?
[02:14:53.733 --> 02:14:56.835]  And he looks at the camera, he goes, OK, well, I'm going to attack them if they don't pay me back.
[02:14:57.195 --> 02:14:59.476]  They were slant drilling into his best oil fields.
[02:14:59.997 --> 02:15:06.241]  And he said, fine, I will quit over pumping if Saudi Arabia and Kuwait quit stealing my oil.
[02:15:08.174 --> 02:15:09.835]  And he was CIA commander.
[02:15:09.875 --> 02:15:11.036]  He thought he had it all.
[02:15:11.576 --> 02:15:13.097]  And they basically told him, yeah, go ahead.
[02:15:13.137 --> 02:15:13.877]  Go ahead and take that.
[02:15:13.917 --> 02:15:14.458]  We'll let you.
[02:15:15.358 --> 02:15:17.920]  And when Nancy did that, it was all over, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:19.741]  And that's the facts.
[02:15:20.301 --> 02:15:30.587]  And then to make Iraq even meltdown worse, they disbanded the Iraqi military, that was the only unifying force, to break the country in multiple parts, which they've effectively done, but not officially, to then balkanize it.
[02:15:30.867 --> 02:15:33.708]  I mean, that's how this stuff works, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:33.969 --> 02:15:35.049]  It's called the great game.
[02:15:35.389 --> 02:15:36.190]  Divide and conquer.
[02:15:37.944 --> 02:15:39.465]  And it is a massive crime.
[02:15:40.385 --> 02:15:42.065]  Iran wanted to be modern.
[02:15:43.266 --> 02:15:44.606]  And had always been modern.
[02:15:45.407 --> 02:15:48.808]  And wanted shopping malls and movie theaters under Mohammad Mossadegh.
[02:15:49.308 --> 02:15:50.609]  So our government took him out.
[02:15:50.989 --> 02:15:52.829]  They're not allowed to have skyscrapers.
[02:15:53.069 --> 02:15:54.770]  They're not allowed to have happy beaches.
[02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:59.132]  Because the globalists run the Wahhabist Jihadis.
[02:15:59.852 --> 02:16:00.452]  Period.
[02:16:01.272 --> 02:16:02.753]  We're not allowed to be free because of them.
[02:16:03.550 --> 02:16:04.531]  And who do they work for?
[02:16:04.611 --> 02:16:05.832]  It's like the skeleton key.
[02:16:05.872 --> 02:16:07.893]  It opens every door for the bankers.
[02:16:08.614 --> 02:16:11.176]  Want to take American liberty and get trillions of no-bid contracts here?
[02:16:11.876 --> 02:16:13.237]  Stage some stuff with these guys.
[02:16:13.778 --> 02:16:15.219]  Want to be able to invade any country you want?
[02:16:15.319 --> 02:16:18.441]  Say these guys are in the country, and then kill whoever you want.
[02:16:18.561 --> 02:16:20.623]  Or have these guys invade a country you want to invade.
[02:16:21.003 --> 02:16:22.804]  It is a skeleton key, folks.
[02:16:23.825 --> 02:16:25.767]  It is a master key, I'm telling you.
[02:16:26.067 --> 02:16:30.110]  I've told you for 14 years that Al-Qaeda is the sword of the New World Order.
[02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:32.191]  They are the tire
[02:16:33.112 --> 02:16:34.913]  You know, fixer, fix-a-flat.
[02:16:35.034 --> 02:16:37.275]  They are the Swiss Army Knife.
[02:16:37.655 --> 02:16:38.776]  They cook the dinner.
[02:16:38.856 --> 02:16:41.378]  They give the new order its massages.
[02:16:41.799 --> 02:16:55.609]  I mean, they're all right there in the middle of the world, where Asia and Eurasia and Eastern Europe and Southern Europe and Western Europe and Africa, all of it, they're right there in the middle of it.
[02:16:56.229 --> 02:16:59.932]  Running around with US weapons chanting Osama Bin Laden.
[02:17:00.713 --> 02:17:02.234]  And then saying, first they said,
[02:17:03.592 --> 02:17:04.913]  I'm never going to get to all these people.
[02:17:05.993 --> 02:17:06.794]  But you bring up good points.
[02:17:06.834 --> 02:17:11.096]  First they said, okay, first we're getting Libya, and they chanted this on the BBC.
[02:17:11.476 --> 02:17:13.097]  Next, Syria.
[02:17:13.717 --> 02:17:14.718]  Then Jerusalem.
[02:17:14.758 --> 02:17:15.558]  Then Cairo.
[02:17:15.638 --> 02:17:16.919]  This was on the news again yesterday.
[02:17:17.479 --> 02:17:19.600]  With Zawahiri, the head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:20.801]  And then America.
[02:17:21.261 --> 02:17:29.785]  And they chant, we will kill you, we will missile you, and the government's going to let them in to missile stuff so the cops can grandstand and take all our rights!
[02:17:30.425 --> 02:17:31.566]  Anybody figure this out yet?
[02:17:32.226 --> 02:17:33.067]  Good, I hope you have.
[02:17:34.090 --> 02:17:37.232]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Secrets of the Fed from New Jersey, go ahead.
[02:17:38.213 --> 02:17:39.614]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:17:39.794 --> 02:17:40.175]  Thank you.
[02:17:40.195 --> 02:17:44.218]  I'm representing part of a battalion out here, the Info Battalion in New Jersey.
[02:17:44.478 --> 02:17:47.821]  I just wanted to get your opinion on some stuff I've been following here.
[02:17:48.621 --> 02:17:55.307]  I'm sure you're aware that a week or two ago, Google was shut down for 15 minutes, and that's beat 40% of internet traffic.
[02:17:55.647 --> 02:17:58.049]  Facebook experienced some outages.
[02:17:58.129 --> 02:18:02.953]  Last week, YouTube the same, Twitter, the news... Yeah, no, there's undoubtedly a cyber war going on.
[02:18:03.653 --> 02:18:13.798]  And it's undoubtedly some of its foreigners, but most of its cyber command, as they said four years ago, will attack our own systems to then get the cyber security bill passed.
[02:18:14.278 --> 02:18:20.921]  All the big cyber command bases they've built are to shut down free speech and shut down the old web, forcing you onto the censored new web.
[02:18:20.941 --> 02:18:21.241]  Go ahead.
[02:18:22.563 --> 02:18:23.043]  Exactly.
[02:18:23.103 --> 02:18:28.147]  And then, while food is important to control population, obviously information is the most important.
[02:18:28.187 --> 02:18:33.850]  So, this internet that Stanford created back in what, the 60s, is now being used against them.
[02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:45.298]  So, do you think that, especially with the NASDAQ being hacked, DHS constantly warning of, you know, oh, you know, be scared, there's going to be a big cyber attack and it's going to destroy things.
[02:18:46.192 --> 02:18:47.852]  They're mentioning that the U.S.
[02:18:47.912 --> 02:18:52.094]  and Israel are going to be attacked because of retribution for what's going on.
[02:18:52.374 --> 02:18:55.335]  Absolutely, the globalists may cruise missile Syria and do it themselves.
[02:18:55.655 --> 02:18:57.735]  No, I mean, these are the times that try men's souls.
[02:18:58.035 --> 02:18:59.936]  These are the times when world wars start.
[02:19:00.216 --> 02:19:03.197]  It's the exact type of political constellation.
[02:19:03.897 --> 02:19:06.177]  But expanding on what you said, I didn't even mention that.
[02:19:06.618 --> 02:19:13.539]  I remember months ago saying they'll do something like hack the NASDAQ or the stock market, the Dow Jones, the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:19:14.839 --> 02:19:16.940]  That's exactly the type of stuff they'll pull.
[02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:27.702]  Plus the big bankers, Goldman Sachs with high frequency trading and all the rest of it, they're on record knowing when they do these fake plunges and stuff, they make sometimes hundreds of billions in a day.
[02:19:28.422 --> 02:19:35.792]  And so it's all a big rigged game, and just like they launched Stuxnet in Iran, and then now say they want cyber security because of Stuxnet.
[02:19:36.312 --> 02:19:37.594]  So I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:19:37.614 --> 02:19:39.316]  There's so much news I read and never get to.
[02:19:39.336 --> 02:19:40.197]  Yeah, what was it?
[02:19:40.237 --> 02:19:42.059]  Two days ago the NASDAQ got hacked?
[02:19:42.921 --> 02:19:45.884]  And it's not even big news, but it is on Capitol Hill.
[02:19:46.983 --> 02:19:50.168]  So, look, God bless you, I appreciate your call, great points.
[02:19:50.669 --> 02:19:58.041]  Billy, Tracy, Lucas, Nick, we'll get to all of you, but then after that, we're taking people who've had their guns taken calls.
[02:20:02.250 --> 02:20:02.670]  Hi there.
[02:20:03.251 --> 02:20:04.331]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:20:04.792 --> 02:20:07.994]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:20:08.614 --> 02:20:17.400]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:23.784]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:20:24.465 --> 02:20:26.046]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:20:26.646 --> 02:20:31.750]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:20:32.470 --> 02:20:39.555]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:20:40.416 --> 02:20:45.320]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:20:45.980 --> 02:20:51.884]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:20:52.485 --> 02:20:57.829]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:20:58.209 --> 02:20:59.330]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:21:01.178 --> 02:21:07.382]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.
[02:21:07.402 --> 02:21:13.927]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cells' ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health.
[02:21:14.387 --> 02:21:18.290]  Listen to the real-world results of Doug and his wife after taking One World Way.
[02:21:18.570 --> 02:21:19.771]  My name is Doug Diderot.
[02:21:19.931 --> 02:21:22.773]  For years, I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes.
[02:21:23.013 --> 02:21:26.416]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace.
[02:21:26.896 --> 02:21:33.122]  After being on One World Way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes.
[02:21:33.582 --> 02:21:37.586]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone.
[02:21:37.666 --> 02:21:45.994]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure.
[02:21:46.494 --> 02:21:48.276]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:21:48.536 --> 02:21:50.057]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:21:50.077 --> 02:21:51.398]  888-988-3325.
[02:21:51.518 --> 02:21:57.283]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:21:57.323 --> 02:22:00.566]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:22:00.866 --> 02:22:10.094]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:10.154 --> 02:22:10.895]  This capitalism?
[02:22:10.955 --> 02:22:17.059]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:17.119 --> 02:22:20.741]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:22:20.821 --> 02:22:21.742]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:22:21.762 --> 02:22:23.103]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:22:23.143 --> 02:22:23.423]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:23.463 --> 02:22:23.743]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:32.371]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[02:22:32.651 --> 02:22:36.772]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[02:22:37.092 --> 02:22:43.835]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[02:22:44.315 --> 02:22:48.157]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[02:22:48.597 --> 02:22:50.397]  Fortunately, there is something you can do about it.
[02:22:50.698 --> 02:22:54.819]  Learn how to be invisible, lock down your privacy, and even disappear forever.
[02:22:55.279 --> 02:22:57.540]  Go to privacylockdown.com to learn how.
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:22:59.381]  That's privacylockdown.com.

[02:23:16.279 --> 02:23:27.065]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.

[02:23:48.706 --> 02:23:50.730]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:22.903]  Alright, on the verge of an escalation in the criminal attack on Syria that's been going on with our government, run by the foreign bankers allied with Al-Qaeda.
[02:24:25.084 --> 02:24:34.087]  On the verge of a crisis that could lead to a third world war, according to the British Ministry of Defense, according to many of the experts we've interviewed here.
[02:24:35.851 --> 02:24:45.122]  We have the prosecution of the war against the Bill of Rights and Constitution going on by the globalist occupied government headed up by their front man Obama.
[02:24:45.602 --> 02:24:49.507]  And even Bloomberg has run the headline the last few months of gun confiscation against California.
[02:24:51.263 --> 02:24:55.025]  And in many cases, they don't even take you in for a psychiatric evaluation.
[02:24:55.706 --> 02:24:58.647]  They don't even try to twist your arm into agreeing to hand over your guns.
[02:24:59.028 --> 02:24:59.888]  They just take them.
[02:24:59.948 --> 02:25:09.874]  And I'm seeing more and more cases of even talk show hosts, usually smaller ones, but people that have got a nice little following, people with YouTube channels, where they show up and take your guns.
[02:25:09.934 --> 02:25:11.695]  And it's clearly a chilling effect.
[02:25:11.715 --> 02:25:13.316]  They're also targeting veterans.
[02:25:13.416 --> 02:25:16.598]  And I had Joe Mendez on for about 20 minutes last Sunday.
[02:25:16.618 --> 02:25:20.641]  I want to get him back on today to open up some phone lines
[02:25:22.209 --> 02:25:26.731]  And in fact, these callers that are there, John, you can get their numbers if they want us to call them back.
[02:25:27.292 --> 02:25:27.952]  We've run out of time.
[02:25:27.972 --> 02:25:30.393]  We've got Tracy in France and others I want to get to, and we will.
[02:25:32.034 --> 02:25:34.876]  But we need to open the phones up for people that have had their guns confiscated.
[02:25:35.576 --> 02:25:41.759]  Specifically, if just out of the blue, and they won't tell you, or you're a veteran, and they say, oh, well, you got PTSD, give us your guns.
[02:25:41.779 --> 02:25:43.340]  Because a lot of times it's done through fraud.
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:44.721]  They don't even take you to court.
[02:25:44.821 --> 02:25:45.561]  This is in the news.
[02:25:46.382 --> 02:25:47.882]  They just come and take your guns.
[02:25:47.902 --> 02:25:49.663]  And then you're like, well, what's your right to do it?
[02:25:49.683 --> 02:25:50.504]  Well, we got guns.
[02:25:51.559 --> 02:25:59.002]  So, you know, it's like that poster that shows the Communist Chinese executing people, and it says, gun control's great when you're the only ones that have the guns.
[02:25:59.823 --> 02:26:08.406]  So he's got WarriorForGod13 is his YouTube website, where you can go see the stuff he talks about, just kind of Patriot, Libertarian, Christian stuff.
[02:26:08.466 --> 02:26:11.167]  Kind of American-style freedom stuff, that's why it's so bad.
[02:26:11.828 --> 02:26:18.931]  He got SWAT teamed by the ATF and a local brigade of police, and 70-plus percent of people in the jail when he got there were people like him.
[02:26:19.898 --> 02:26:23.479]  So they have federal grants all over the country, and that's what Bloomberg's been reporting on.
[02:26:23.779 --> 02:26:25.400]  So I wanted to get Joe Mendez on.
[02:26:25.780 --> 02:26:30.381]  Joe, did you get any support or any people contact you when you were on the show Sunday?
[02:26:30.401 --> 02:26:34.182]  Because I know you're looking for folks to help you so that we can find out.
[02:26:34.202 --> 02:26:41.764]  Because you, again, you've just been told your guns have been taken and that your guns are illegal, even though they're legal semi-autos you bought back in the 80s.
[02:26:42.304 --> 02:26:43.825]  And I've read the California laws.
[02:26:43.985 --> 02:26:44.605]  It's just you can't...
[02:26:45.245 --> 02:26:53.429]  You can't buy or sell new ones in the state, but your guns are grandfathered, so this is kind of that Twilight Zone thing.
[02:26:53.709 --> 02:26:55.450]  What's happened since you were on four days ago?
[02:26:56.650 --> 02:27:01.612]  Well, I've had a lot of support from your viewers, and I thank everybody.
[02:27:02.013 --> 02:27:04.994]  God bless you all for the support that you've given me.
[02:27:06.875 --> 02:27:11.597]  I also emailed the Rutherford Institute, and they're looking at the case.
[02:27:11.617 --> 02:27:13.878]  They said they would get back to me in a couple of days.
[02:27:14.851 --> 02:27:18.494]  Um, yeah, other than that, though, I will tell you this.
[02:27:19.574 --> 02:27:30.762]  It is very clear to me now that the public defender's office here, which I have to work with until I can afford a real lawyer, it has no intention of defending me.
[02:27:31.882 --> 02:27:34.064]  Basically, they're bumping me back and forth.
[02:27:34.084 --> 02:27:35.565]  I'm getting conflicting reports.
[02:27:36.335 --> 02:27:38.937]  It is now, what is it, the 29th?
[02:27:39.078 --> 02:27:54.111]  And I still, to this day, have not, I have not received my complete discovery as to why there was probable cause to issue a warrant for my guns, which I know I have the right to because the normal lawyer told me I have the right to that.
[02:27:54.651 --> 02:27:56.833]  Yes, they have not provided for that.
[02:27:56.973 --> 02:28:00.516]  The public defender will not push the district attorney on that.
[02:28:00.896 --> 02:28:05.981]  And to this day, since they switched me to another court, I don't even know who my public defender is.
[02:28:06.041 --> 02:28:07.182]  I've called them four times.
[02:28:07.962 --> 02:28:12.026]  And finally, I got a call from someone who said, I don't represent you.
[02:28:12.046 --> 02:28:14.888]  This and this and this.
[02:28:15.689 --> 02:28:17.210]  And you were told to go to the wrong one.
[02:28:17.871 --> 02:28:20.333]  And what I feel is they're trying to confuse me.
[02:28:20.373 --> 02:28:22.615]  And I told him, well, what if I show up at the wrong one?
[02:28:23.442 --> 02:28:36.617]  You're telling me that I'm not in this division where I was given the paperwork from the court to go to, that they're wrong to go to the other one, and if I go to the other one,
[02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:38.856]  You know, and I don't show up to this one.
[02:28:38.936 --> 02:28:41.258]  I'm gonna be arrested and put back into custody.
[02:28:41.278 --> 02:28:44.561]  He goes, I don't know what to tell you, but I'm not your public defender.
[02:28:44.581 --> 02:28:45.341]  They'll let you know.
[02:28:45.682 --> 02:28:47.243]  And then he goes, you're in no hurry, right?
[02:28:47.323 --> 02:28:51.286]  And I said, yeah, I want to know if there has been probable cause enough.
[02:28:52.127 --> 02:28:54.769]  And if not, which I already know there hasn't.
[02:28:55.329 --> 02:28:56.350]  And they're just stalling.
[02:28:56.390 --> 02:28:58.792]  I feel the state is just stalling the railroad.
[02:28:58.852 --> 02:29:04.517]  Well sure, I mean this is a communist and authoritarian tactic, an imperial tactic that empires would use.
[02:29:04.937 --> 02:29:07.459]  They arrest you or fine you because you won't comply.
[02:29:07.779 --> 02:29:09.421]  They make it impossible to comply.
[02:29:09.441 --> 02:29:11.763]  It's like they write the regulations where...
[02:29:12.463 --> 02:29:21.355]  Three-inch grass or objectionable material, then they call three leaves on your property objectionable and give you fines here in Austin for $2,000 a day.
[02:29:21.375 --> 02:29:25.981]  And they mainly target old people because they know that, you know, they don't know what to do and they can then take their house.
[02:29:26.302 --> 02:29:27.343]  This is a criminal group.
[02:29:28.124 --> 02:29:31.866]  And absolutely, they took your guns illegally, now they're just gonna pass it around.
[02:29:32.206 --> 02:29:34.167]  It's a federal homeland security grant.
[02:29:34.827 --> 02:29:37.928]  And they tell them, look, it's homeland security, you're allowed to break the rules.
[02:29:38.429 --> 02:29:44.231]  And just like Katrina, where they went and confiscated all the guns, they're setting the precedence right now.
[02:29:44.291 --> 02:29:45.752]  That's why this is such a big deal.
[02:29:46.212 --> 02:29:49.874]  The gun confiscation has already begun, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:51.054 --> 02:29:53.936]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.964 --> 02:29:57.746]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:04.871]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:30:04.891 --> 02:30:12.476]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:30:12.917 --> 02:30:17.580]  Hundreds of you helped eFoods Direct ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:19.781]  The problem is we can't help everybody.

[02:33:02.191 --> 02:33:09.117]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:33:09.217 --> 02:33:12.740]  It's not about keeping guns out of the hands of law-abiding Americans.
[02:33:12.960 --> 02:33:15.802]  And I'm sick and tired of people lying to the American people.
[02:33:15.942 --> 02:33:19.305]  We can't have a totally armed society.
[02:33:19.605 --> 02:33:22.489]  We're not proposing a gun registration system.
[02:33:22.509 --> 02:33:24.792]  We're proposing background checks for criminals.
[02:33:25.413 --> 02:33:28.777]  In the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your entire security team?
[02:33:29.798 --> 02:33:31.240]  You'll get right back to me.
[02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:32.021]  You'll get back to me?
[02:33:32.061 --> 02:33:33.003]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:33:33.263 --> 02:33:34.304]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:33:34.605 --> 02:33:35.446]  Mao took the guns.
[02:33:35.686 --> 02:33:36.947]  Adel Castro took the guns.
[02:33:36.987 --> 02:33:37.187]  How many?
[02:33:37.227 --> 02:33:38.367]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[02:33:38.527 --> 02:33:43.829]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[02:33:43.989 --> 02:33:48.291]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[02:33:48.491 --> 02:33:49.811]  We will not relinquish them.
[02:33:50.011 --> 02:33:50.892]  Do you understand?
[02:33:50.912 --> 02:33:52.192]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:52.312 --> 02:33:54.533]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:12.383 --> 02:34:26.372]  I'm just a patriot, a freedom lover who sees total criminal government swarming us, bomb-rushing us on every single front.
[02:34:27.557 --> 02:34:35.379]  With an organized criminal plan for a corporate above-the-law world government known, in their own words, as a New World Order.
[02:34:36.119 --> 02:34:38.600]  A technocratic dictatorship.
[02:34:39.961 --> 02:34:40.801]  And I don't like it.
[02:34:41.561 --> 02:34:42.481]  I want to stand against it.
[02:34:42.541 --> 02:34:44.862]  Now, I've cleaned the phones out.
[02:34:46.141 --> 02:34:52.765]  And I appreciate listeners letting us do that for folks that we're already holding, because now we have to shift gears into, have you had your guns confiscated?
[02:34:53.506 --> 02:34:58.489]  Or are you the family member of a veteran who's had their guns confiscated wrongfully?
[02:34:58.509 --> 02:35:05.334]  I mean, obviously, if somebody's saying, I'm gonna kill myself, I'm gonna kill others, then all the government-issued drugs, they're screwed up, they have to have their guns taken.
[02:35:05.774 --> 02:35:08.176]  If they've been adjudicated, hey, this person's clearly mentally ill.
[02:35:08.596 --> 02:35:09.837]  But that's not what we're talking about.
[02:35:11.078 --> 02:35:13.079]  I mean, Adam Lanza had been adjudicated mentally ill.
[02:35:14.332 --> 02:35:16.353]  He tried to buy guns illegally five times.
[02:35:17.453 --> 02:35:18.654]  That's the Sandy Hook Patsy.
[02:35:19.334 --> 02:35:28.138]  Even if you believe the official story, and it's all very suspicious, the anti-terror drill, the guys dressed like him in the woods that got picked up, they tried to deny it until the helicopter footage got released.
[02:35:28.198 --> 02:35:29.659]  I mean, whoa!
[02:35:30.199 --> 02:35:31.920]  Doesn't look good, all the timing.
[02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:40.324]  The point is, I mean, if they'll fund Al-Qaeda to kill tens of thousands, excuse me, 200,000 Christians, mainly, in Syria, what will they do?
[02:35:40.344 --> 02:35:41.545]  Oh, they wouldn't do that here, though.
[02:35:41.585 --> 02:35:42.145]  The point is,
[02:35:43.618 --> 02:36:00.585]  Is that we're all in grave danger with this situation and they, you know, they talk a good game of, oh, for your safety, but we know the proliferation of guns has made, depending on the federal statistic, 49 to 61 percent drop in gun crime in the United States from 1992 to 2011.
[02:36:01.225 --> 02:36:03.106]  That's the latest numbers we have.
[02:36:03.446 --> 02:36:05.047]  We've beat that dead horse a thousand times.
[02:36:05.067 --> 02:36:06.988]  Those numbers have been out almost a year now.
[02:36:08.248 --> 02:36:08.888]  Almost a year.
[02:36:09.088 --> 02:36:12.370]  They came out in January of this year, so eight, eight, nine months.
[02:36:13.767 --> 02:36:15.355]  And you don't want you knowing about that.
[02:36:16.869 --> 02:36:19.691]  We're gonna go back to our guest here in just a moment.
[02:36:19.751 --> 02:36:23.935]  Don't forget, in these insane times, now more than ever, I personally have storable food.
[02:36:24.555 --> 02:36:26.136]  eFoodsDirect is a great company.
[02:36:26.156 --> 02:36:36.865]  There's a lot of great companies out there, but eFoods has really good prices and high quality, and it's where I get my storable foods, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[02:36:36.885 --> 02:36:45.391]  And that's where I've gotten my storable foods, and they've got a really good special going right now, free shipping on several other specials.
[02:36:46.532 --> 02:36:51.934]  Order two for one yourself, and for a loved one, so that's good, and get free shipping.
[02:36:51.954 --> 02:36:58.836]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com, forward slash Alex.
[02:36:59.797 --> 02:37:02.658]  And also, getting prepared with all the craziness in the world.
[02:37:03.138 --> 02:37:08.700]  The best gravity-fed filters out there that I personally use, after doing the research for two years.
[02:37:09.740 --> 02:37:15.144]  Because I just couldn't find other good companies, really, from my perspective, my view out there, my opinion on that.
[02:37:15.165 --> 02:37:17.646]  But you can see the side-by-side comparisons.
[02:37:18.855 --> 02:37:28.017]  at InfowarsStore.com between the ProPure and its Pro1 systems and some of its other filter systems, side-by-side with the leading competitors.
[02:37:28.057 --> 02:37:31.518]  And it's just hands down what we use in the RV, on the road, what we use at home.
[02:37:32.298 --> 02:37:35.419]  eFoodsDirect.com for your storable foods.
[02:37:35.899 --> 02:37:46.722]  But InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsStore.com for 10% off the already lowest price on Pro1 and ProPure systems at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:37:47.122 --> 02:37:54.758]  And you're getting a great product at a great price and funding our hardcore news division that has taken the globalist on head-on.
[02:37:55.629 --> 02:38:00.873]  Now, I get these gun confiscation calls all the time, like Brandon Robb, and it becomes a national story with that Marine.
[02:38:00.893 --> 02:38:04.495]  Now, they said, we're not going to let you out of here until you agree you're mentally ill and all that.
[02:38:04.575 --> 02:38:06.576]  We got them the Rutherford Institute to help him.
[02:38:06.596 --> 02:38:09.538]  We've contacted the Rutherford Institute to try to help Mr. Mendez.
[02:38:10.239 --> 02:38:12.480]  But there's other good groups out there as well.
[02:38:13.361 --> 02:38:16.763]  And usually, I can load the phones up with people to tell us how they have their guns taken.
[02:38:16.803 --> 02:38:17.944]  But here's the number, 800-259-9231.
[02:38:17.964 --> 02:38:18.004]  800-259-9231.
[02:38:25.849 --> 02:38:29.013]  And you can also call and tell us what you think Mr. Mendez should do.
[02:38:29.033 --> 02:38:31.877]  I mean, I know legally what I would probably do.
[02:38:31.897 --> 02:38:41.188]  I mean, there's a lot of other legal proceedings you can engage in when they've wrongfully done this.
[02:38:42.253 --> 02:38:45.734]  But it generally is particular to the state itself.
[02:38:46.334 --> 02:38:50.856]  So I should probably get lawyers on myself to break all this down, that aggressively fight against this type of thing.
[02:38:50.876 --> 02:39:00.699]  But imagine, they take your guns and they won't say why they came with a warrant, how they knew about the guns from the 1980s, that again, I've looked at the type of guns they were, those are illegal in California.
[02:39:01.179 --> 02:39:03.440]  So will everybody have their semi-autos taken in California?
[02:39:04.728 --> 02:39:08.309]  Joe Mendes, this happened to a while back ago now and they won't let him know, joins us.
[02:39:09.070 --> 02:39:11.871]  And again, the toll free number to give us your take on this is 800-259-9231.
[02:39:11.891 --> 02:39:14.151]  So Joe, you talked about the runaround you're getting.
[02:39:20.865 --> 02:39:27.666]  Tell us more about the raid, for those that just joined us, how they briefly called you outside with the state police about a hit and run with your car.
[02:39:28.367 --> 02:39:30.887]  You or your wife hadn't left, you're like, that doesn't make sense.
[02:39:31.247 --> 02:39:37.549]  He calls on the radio, okay, I've got Joe Mendez here, and they stick M16s in your face, okay, for them to have guns.
[02:39:38.489 --> 02:39:47.791]  And I believe they did this politically because of the political things you've said, because we're seeing more of the persecution against people that are not communist.
[02:39:47.811 --> 02:39:48.771]  I mean, if you're a communist,
[02:39:49.651 --> 02:39:50.432]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:39:50.452 --> 02:39:50.672]  You know,
[02:40:08.194 --> 02:40:14.797]  Like I was saying last time, my son actually got visited about two months before I did.
[02:40:15.377 --> 02:40:20.579]  FBI and Department of Homeland Security ransacked the house where he lived.
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:23.721]  The thing is that he doesn't possess firearms.
[02:40:24.241 --> 02:40:24.821]  Or anything.
[02:40:24.861 --> 02:40:35.946]  But you see, they were hoping that as a father you'd given him guns and that then they could say it was illegal because guns legally owned from the 80s were grandfathered, but you had transferred them.
[02:40:36.446 --> 02:40:39.047]  That's what my gut tells me, knowing how their dirty tricks work.
[02:40:39.895 --> 02:40:40.335]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:40:40.435 --> 02:40:47.880]  And when they didn't find anything, they, you know, he fought back and he told them, you know, you broke my constitutional rights and what have you and this and that.
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:58.247]  And they, they, uh, he told me the FBI agent that conducted the raid called him about a week later to try to convince him that everything had been done legally and blah, blah, blah and this and that.
[02:40:58.267 --> 02:41:01.209]  And he got a lawyer and they backed off.
[02:41:01.709 --> 02:41:09.214]  But I told him it's all because of the videos that I make on YouTube and the affiliation that you have with me that they started with you first.
[02:41:10.655 --> 02:41:17.440]  Then, what we noticed is that there was a lot of activity here at the complex from weird, strange things.
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:22.803]  They sent a car about a month and a half before to videotape the whole parking lot.
[02:41:22.823 --> 02:41:27.267]  It was an unmarked car with a G marking on the plate, which we know that that's a government-issued car.
[02:41:28.227 --> 02:41:31.830]  It drove through the parking lot, parked in a spot for a couple of seconds, backed out.
[02:41:32.270 --> 02:41:33.091]  I don't know.
[02:41:47.970 --> 02:42:10.643]  We get a lot of tenants that go in and out, like I said, months before, there was a man cooking meth in one of the apartments here, and when we called the police department, they came out, the police must have come out like 45 times and never did nothing to this guy who was cooking meth and selling out of his apartment, and at one point... Well, they moderated you because you're cutting in on their meth deal, you know?
[02:42:11.023 --> 02:42:15.186]  I mean, this guy's probably too small of a time, I mean, you know the government runs most of the drugs.
[02:42:15.766 --> 02:42:17.167]  Of course, of course.
[02:42:17.207 --> 02:42:31.418]  And the cop said, he goes, even if he had everything on the living room table and he was fabricating it, he said we couldn't do anything to him because there's no money in the budget to prosecute for drug offenses.
[02:42:32.078 --> 02:42:37.462]  And the day that we were going to court, we were listening on a radio show where Congress was going to go up for both
[02:42:38.038 --> 02:42:42.321]  To go easier on drug offenders and drug sellers.
[02:42:43.322 --> 02:42:45.563]  There's no room, apparently, for them.
[02:42:45.583 --> 02:42:47.725]  They want to get all the gun owners.
[02:42:47.845 --> 02:42:57.771]  Well, no, no, that's what happens is that they first build the prisons and prime them with the non-violent drug offenders or the violent drug offenders, and then they put the patriots in them.
[02:42:58.432 --> 02:42:59.032]  In fact, in REC-84,
[02:43:00.894 --> 02:43:09.863]  That's actually what they talked about was, we'll build the FEMA camps and put illegals in them as the excuse to have them, but really it's for the American people.
[02:43:10.784 --> 02:43:16.690]  And Michael Hastings, the journalist, was looking into the endgame, which is the Illegal Alien Roundup Plan.
[02:43:16.770 --> 02:43:19.974]  It's really RECS 84.
[02:43:20.014 --> 02:43:21.475]  2012 was the last year of that official program.
[02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:28.417]  But it came out, that's really the cover for the mass roundup plan for citizens.
[02:43:28.437 --> 02:43:35.165]  So they build the infrastructure for the illegals, but it's really for political dissidents in the final equation.
[02:43:35.185 --> 02:43:35.646]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:43:36.667 --> 02:43:42.434]  Yeah, and, well, you know, that day, that day they send in a phony CHP card.
[02:43:43.454 --> 02:43:45.956]  And, uh, we got it all on the surveillance cameras.
[02:43:45.996 --> 02:43:52.422]  The guy gets off, goes around our car, looks at the BIN, and then walks to the office.
[02:43:52.582 --> 02:44:02.351]  My wife is the manager here, and he tells her, your car was involved in a hit-and-run last night, and we need, we know it's not you guys.
[02:44:02.931 --> 02:44:09.754]  We need a statement from everybody who normally rides in the car, which I found very strange.
[02:44:09.774 --> 02:44:11.275]  So he gave you a fake criminal report.
[02:44:11.295 --> 02:44:12.716]  It's all part of lying to the enemy.
[02:44:12.776 --> 02:44:13.236]  That's us.
[02:44:13.796 --> 02:44:14.476]  Yes, yes.
[02:44:14.637 --> 02:44:22.300]  And he told her that apparently a black man was reported driving our car and being in an accident in it and what have you.
[02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:25.341]  And I said, man, the car never left last night.
[02:44:25.361 --> 02:44:26.082]  How could that be?
[02:44:26.822 --> 02:44:30.106]  And my wife said he won't leave until you come down and give him a statement.
[02:44:30.447 --> 02:44:32.329]  And now you've lost your job thanks to this.
[02:44:32.669 --> 02:44:41.800]  I think that's going to be part of the lawsuit, civil lawsuit, is that the damages you've gone through under this false arrest and false imprisonment.
[02:44:42.822 --> 02:44:43.843]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:44:43.863 --> 02:44:44.404]  Please continue.
[02:44:45.438 --> 02:44:51.501]  Yeah, so I proceed to get into the office and he shakes my hand and he says, how you doing?
[02:44:51.521 --> 02:44:54.202]  He's like, I'm just going to take a statement from you.
[02:44:54.282 --> 02:44:55.143]  It's routine.
[02:44:55.943 --> 02:44:58.785]  There was some trouble with your car last night.
[02:44:59.525 --> 02:45:03.747]  A black man was reported to be driving your car, but you're not a black man, right?
[02:45:03.807 --> 02:45:05.188]  So you've got nothing to worry about.
[02:45:05.648 --> 02:45:06.688]  He says, what is your name?
[02:45:06.728 --> 02:45:08.109]  And I call him, my name is Joe Mendez.
[02:45:08.229 --> 02:45:10.030]  And he said, okay.
[02:45:10.090 --> 02:45:14.032]  And he calls him to his radio and he says, I have a Joe Mendez.
[02:45:14.893 --> 02:45:33.775]  As soon as he said that, the door to the office right behind me opened up, three agents, three additional agents came in, one of them immediately grabbed my hands and started putting handcuffs on me, and like I said, two M16 machine guns came within five inches from my face on each side and they were yelling at me,
[02:45:36.004 --> 02:45:52.477]  Listen let me ask you this question again folks this is how they're rolling out right now to take the guns all over the country and it's happening and I've seen it I see it all the time it's usually a vet will be cleaning guns usually an old man Illinois Wisconsin Texas you see it all the time
[02:45:53.277 --> 02:45:55.538]  And they'll clean a gun or put it in their trunk to go shooting.
[02:45:55.838 --> 02:46:03.302]  The neighbor calls, and the cops, because the neighbor saw a gun, it's legal, go ahead and take them all and say, well, it's an arsenal.
[02:46:03.322 --> 02:46:05.103]  He had five guns and a thousand rounds of ammo.
[02:46:05.403 --> 02:46:07.464]  Well, an arsenal's not illegal, but that's not even an arsenal.
[02:46:07.904 --> 02:46:09.405]  And then it's like, well, your guns are gone.
[02:46:09.925 --> 02:46:11.026]  And there's no law.
[02:46:11.726 --> 02:46:15.048]  And I see this stuff like every week now, and they're not getting in trouble.
[02:46:15.828 --> 02:46:17.509]  And then I talked to you about the type of guns you had.
[02:46:17.549 --> 02:46:18.050]  I looked it up.
[02:46:18.130 --> 02:46:19.931]  I've had experts on about it.
[02:46:20.431 --> 02:46:22.833]  I mean, the guns you had are totally legal if not purchased.
[02:46:23.093 --> 02:46:27.876]  Alex, they sell those guns at gun shows still here in California.
[02:46:28.176 --> 02:46:32.719]  That's why I told the cop, I said, you guys, they're selling this exact same rifle here.
[02:46:32.739 --> 02:46:38.263]  They just put the bullet button on the magazine clipper or something, but it's got a pistol grip.
[02:46:38.383 --> 02:46:42.506]  I know, but I've read the state law on what happened to you because I looked in this before you came on last Sunday.
[02:46:42.766 --> 02:46:45.528]  The point is the gun you've got, you've bought before the ban is legal.
[02:46:46.188 --> 02:46:46.429]  Yeah.
[02:46:47.109 --> 02:46:52.894]  And so my point is it just shows they're targeting law-abiding people with no criminal record like yourself.
[02:46:53.274 --> 02:47:00.460]  Now, let's... I want to go to phone calls to get people's take on all this, but ladies and gentlemen...
[02:47:01.451 --> 02:47:02.652]  This is happening everywhere.
[02:47:02.692 --> 02:47:05.855]  You have to understand, we've got to get aggressive politically.
[02:47:05.895 --> 02:47:08.197]  Congressional investigations, you name it.
[02:47:08.237 --> 02:47:09.738]  The ATF's got to be defunded.
[02:47:09.758 --> 02:47:11.700]  It is such a criminal group.
[02:47:13.141 --> 02:47:18.706]  And they're the old revenuers that would go around killing people if they didn't pay them money on their moonshine.
[02:47:18.746 --> 02:47:19.667]  That's what they come out of.
[02:47:19.707 --> 02:47:22.329]  They've always been total criminals.
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:28.627]  And I'm not saying every person that works at the ATF is a criminal, but it is the most criminal agency in U.S.
[02:47:28.647 --> 02:47:29.027]  history.
[02:47:29.308 --> 02:47:29.948]  It's famous.
[02:47:30.489 --> 02:47:36.897]  They were recently discovered dealing with a cartel south of the border, dealing arms to the cartel south of the border.
[02:47:36.917 --> 02:47:37.918]  Well, certainly, sir.
[02:47:37.938 --> 02:47:39.019]  It came out in federal court.
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:41.301]  That was in exchange for cocaine.
[02:47:41.361 --> 02:47:42.902]  They are an importation agency.
[02:47:43.322 --> 02:47:43.762]  They are.
[02:47:43.802 --> 02:47:44.983]  They're bigger than Los Zetas.
[02:47:45.303 --> 02:47:46.383]  That's why they're so criminal.
[02:47:46.464 --> 02:47:46.924]  Exactly.
[02:47:47.144 --> 02:47:50.666]  You cannot stress what a murdering group of criminals they are.
[02:47:51.426 --> 02:47:52.587]  They bombed Oklahoma City.
[02:47:52.727 --> 02:47:53.647]  They were involved in that.
[02:47:54.368 --> 02:47:55.108]  They did Waco.
[02:47:55.168 --> 02:47:57.009]  I mean, they are a murder crew.
[02:47:57.689 --> 02:47:59.170]  They use them for hits as well.
[02:47:59.590 --> 02:48:00.891]  And you're just lucky they didn't kill you.
[02:48:01.891 --> 02:48:10.098]  But I don't know about these particular goons, but boy, I tell you, they may not be criminals, but they're doing things that are unconstitutional, which is criminal in its own right, in my view.
[02:48:10.438 --> 02:48:12.299]  But the agency itself has a criminal history.
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:14.861]  Now, I want to go to some phone calls here.
[02:48:15.302 --> 02:48:19.044]  Jeff in Pennsylvania, have you been the victim of a gun confiscation, or what's your take?
[02:48:19.064 --> 02:48:22.807]  And then Rob has legal advice he wants to give, or his view on that.
[02:48:22.847 --> 02:48:23.428]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:48:24.349 --> 02:48:25.229]  Yes, I have, Alex.
[02:48:25.289 --> 02:48:27.910]  Long-time listener, first-time caller, love what you're doing.
[02:48:28.711 --> 02:48:33.552]  About three years ago, I woke up in the middle of the night to what I thought was someone kicking down my door.
[02:48:33.572 --> 02:48:39.295]  So I grabbed a Romanian Wachter 10, commonly known as the AK-47, and I stand at the top of my steps.
[02:48:40.175 --> 02:48:45.077]  All of a sudden, the window breaks, something bounces on the ground, and everything turns white, and my ears are ringing.
[02:48:45.919 --> 02:48:47.960]  Turns out the police were kicking down my door.
[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:49.961]  Didn't yell police or anything like that.
[02:48:50.801 --> 02:48:52.622]  They arrested me, confiscated my firearms.
[02:48:52.722 --> 02:48:59.765]  It turns out I was coming home from the firing range and one of my neighbors called the Philadelphia Police saying that they saw me with a firearm.
[02:49:00.065 --> 02:49:02.066]  See, exactly what I just said.
[02:49:02.086 --> 02:49:04.847]  And Jeff, we didn't screen your call, did we?
[02:49:05.708 --> 02:49:06.128]  No, sir.
[02:49:06.388 --> 02:49:08.409]  See, this is happening everywhere.
[02:49:09.468 --> 02:49:11.589]  And a lot of times they'll kill the vet, too.
[02:49:12.109 --> 02:49:14.271]  When they go to the house and kick down the door, they'll grab a gun.
[02:49:14.751 --> 02:49:15.011]  Boom!
[02:49:15.031 --> 02:49:15.952]  The guy's all high-fived.
[02:49:15.972 --> 02:49:16.892]  We killed another vet.
[02:49:17.252 --> 02:49:18.993]  I mean, it's like a victory against us.
[02:49:19.473 --> 02:49:20.474]  They know how to set us up.
[02:49:20.514 --> 02:49:20.994]  Continue.
[02:49:21.935 --> 02:49:27.718]  If I hadn't dropped my firearm when they had flash-banged me, who knows what they would have done because I didn't know it was police.
[02:49:28.378 --> 02:49:32.861]  I thought it was someone, you know... They were hoping you got a gun in your hand so they could get under the notch on their belt.
[02:49:33.261 --> 02:49:35.602]  Killing American gun owners is... They're the enemy.
[02:49:35.642 --> 02:49:36.643]  They ought to be taken out, you know.
[02:49:37.645 --> 02:49:39.426]  Yeah, so it's been going on about three years now.
[02:49:39.446 --> 02:49:41.728]  I filed a return of property in Motions Court.
[02:49:42.388 --> 02:49:57.959]  I'm currently in the Magisterial District Courts trying to get it back, but they've done a whole bunch of unconstitutional procedures, made me fill out all types of questionnaires appertaining to what was these conditions surrounding the arrest, what type of firearms they were.
[02:49:57.979 --> 02:49:58.980]  They were all legally owned.
[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:00.521]  I've yet to get them back.
[02:50:00.601 --> 02:50:04.604]  Hiring an attorney would be about as much as they're worth, so I'm just going at
[02:50:05.270 --> 02:50:09.079]  You know, pro se, but I couldn't believe that they had done that, especially without saying it was police.
[02:50:09.139 --> 02:50:09.841]  I could have been killed.
[02:50:09.901 --> 02:50:10.602]  They could have been killed.
[02:50:10.642 --> 02:50:12.447]  It just could have worked out horribly.
[02:50:12.547 --> 02:50:14.912]  And just because someone saw me coming back from the firing range.
[02:50:15.765 --> 02:50:28.095]  Yeah, well that's the normal thing, is that even rural areas, I saw an article a few years ago where in the edge of the countryside, you know, the city grown in the area, but the old farmer came back and was butchering a deer, deer season.
[02:50:28.755 --> 02:50:29.696]  It was illegal and lawful.
[02:50:30.236 --> 02:50:31.377]  He had his tags.
[02:50:32.078 --> 02:50:37.462]  And the police came and said, well, your neighbors saw it, that's abusive for them to see a dead deer, and arrested him.
[02:50:39.709 --> 02:50:42.539]  I'm telling you folks, they hate good people.
[02:50:42.941 --> 02:50:44.285]  Not all of them, but more and more.
[02:50:44.787 --> 02:50:45.871]  So did you ever get your guns back?
[02:50:47.154 --> 02:50:48.335]  Uh, it's been about three years now.
[02:50:48.375 --> 02:50:50.596]  I have a hearing on the 30th, finally, with the judge.
[02:50:50.676 --> 02:50:52.756]  I had to jump through a bunch of hoops with the ADA.
[02:50:53.237 --> 02:51:00.039]  But I finally have my final hearing in, uh, the Criminal Justice Center in Philadelphia, uh, after I was in lockup for about a week.
[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:01.020]  Hold on, I want to hear this.
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:01.380]  Stay there.
[02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:04.361]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:51:04.601 --> 02:51:08.583]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or, at worst, depression?
[02:51:08.783 --> 02:51:10.804]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:51:11.024 --> 02:51:16.046]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:51:16.186 --> 02:51:17.926]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:51:18.006 --> 02:51:19.347]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:51:19.547 --> 02:51:20.987]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:51:21.027 --> 02:51:24.108]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:51:24.408 --> 02:51:29.430]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:51:29.770 --> 02:51:30.150]  We're good to go.
[02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:48.020]  We're good to go.
[02:52:07.699 --> 02:52:10.842]  Two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:52:11.023 --> 02:52:16.989]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:52:17.089 --> 02:52:27.881]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:52:28.081 --> 02:52:34.387]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:52:34.587 --> 02:52:49.302]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:52:53.245 --> 02:53:04.615]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:05.296 --> 02:53:08.238]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:08.339 --> 02:53:16.646]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.268 --> 02:53:22.210]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:53:41.876 --> 02:53:46.158]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:46.178 --> 02:53:49.359]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[02:53:57.041 --> 02:53:58.021]  Protect your immune system.
[02:53:58.302 --> 02:53:59.342]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:10.426]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:54:11.026 --> 02:54:14.069]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:17.192 --> 02:54:19.274]  I want to explain to everybody out there.
[02:54:19.294 --> 02:54:21.316]  In fact, CJ, get on the microphone briefly.
[02:54:22.157 --> 02:54:23.118]  Everyone I know
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:26.541]  Who's smart living in the city.
[02:54:26.661 --> 02:54:32.844]  If you're going to go to the shooting range or go deer hunting or duck hunting, you put your guns in a case your neighbors can't tell and you sneak out at night.
[02:54:33.185 --> 02:54:35.926]  Now, that's why I love the open carry people.
[02:54:37.027 --> 02:54:39.728]  They are countering the anti-gun people.
[02:54:39.748 --> 02:54:40.729]  Look, my gun's legal.
[02:54:41.749 --> 02:54:44.671]  And the media hates that because then it shows these guns aren't illegal.
[02:54:45.051 --> 02:54:49.294]  But let me tell you, they kill a lot of people because your neighbor sees you putting a deer rifle in your car.
[02:54:50.174 --> 02:54:54.376]  And the cops will pull you over, you put one in your gun rack and harass you.
[02:54:54.876 --> 02:54:59.678]  And this is part of their persecution against us outside of law, and it's time to get aggressive.
[02:54:59.978 --> 02:55:02.960]  But CJ, tell folks what you were telling me during the break.
[02:55:03.420 --> 02:55:12.424]  I was just commenting on the fact that before I can go to the range, sighting a rifle, practice, every good marksman needs to practice frequently so they can keep their aim on.
[02:55:12.484 --> 02:55:13.384]  I have to do it at night.
[02:55:14.065 --> 02:55:18.547]  My progressive neighbors, it's not that I've been, had the police call to me, but I'm not afraid of
[02:55:19.451 --> 02:55:24.114]  Facing the police if I have to, it's just my neighbors don't understand that.
[02:55:24.855 --> 02:55:30.798]  Well take Chris, I mean he's had friends since college and they found out he works here and they said, I am evil and I'm basically the devil.
[02:55:31.619 --> 02:55:34.461]  I mean it's just like we are the bad people, we have to get used to that.
[02:55:34.661 --> 02:55:34.881]  Right.
[02:55:35.001 --> 02:55:39.364]  We are the enemy, we are the terrorists, George Washington is bad, and they actually believe it.
[02:55:40.585 --> 02:55:48.110]  I'm telling you, if you've got commie neighbors, they call themselves progressives, if your kid has their hair sticking up, they'll call the CPS on you.
[02:55:49.127 --> 02:55:51.448]  I mean, these people are just the filth of the planet!
[02:55:52.089 --> 02:55:53.269]  Anything else, evil American?
[02:55:53.849 --> 02:56:01.393]  I did have a friend who was a foreign exchange student from Australia that freaked out the first time he saw a gun rack in a pickup with a rifle in it in Texas.
[02:56:01.673 --> 02:56:03.134]  I know, I know, I know.
[02:56:03.194 --> 02:56:04.115]  It's just incredible.
[02:56:04.375 --> 02:56:05.715]  We haven't gotten a McAdoo's report.
[02:56:05.756 --> 02:56:08.297]  I'm gonna do overdrive to play it and take more calls.
[02:56:09.557 --> 02:56:11.598]  Some stations don't carry it, but I go into the fourth hour.
[02:56:11.618 --> 02:56:13.399]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:56:13.419 --> 02:56:19.301]  If you want to find the podcast, the audio feeds, the live free video feed, if you want to be able to see that report when it's coming up.
[02:56:19.321 --> 02:56:23.022]  But in this segment, the next, we're going to keep taking calls for Joe Mendez.
[02:56:23.342 --> 02:56:25.763]  But finishing up, Jeff and PA, then we'll go to Rob and others.
[02:56:26.683 --> 02:56:38.247]  Jeff, you say that it's been three years and you finally get to speak to a Lord and King, a judge to get your guns that they took because a neighbor saw one and got scared.
[02:56:39.315 --> 02:56:40.236]  Yes sir, that's correct.
[02:56:40.316 --> 02:56:45.041]  Originally when I was arrested, the Philadelphia Police did not know that it was legal to own a semi-automatic AK-47.
[02:56:45.061 --> 02:56:49.105]  So I stayed in the local jail for about three weeks.
[02:56:49.165 --> 02:56:52.409]  I was visited by the ATF about four different times.
[02:56:53.009 --> 02:56:55.332]  So first I had to go through the ATF hurdles.
[02:56:56.012 --> 02:56:59.773]  After I jumped over them, I went with the local LEPA, per hurdles.
[02:57:00.213 --> 02:57:03.614]  They originally set my bail at $150,000, 10% of which would have been $15,000.
[02:57:03.714 --> 02:57:09.436]  It took me about three and a half weeks to finally get that lowered to $15,000, where I could post 10% of that at $1,500.
[02:57:09.936 --> 02:57:16.197]  And after all this, about three years later, September 30th, I finally have a hearing now, where I can present my case.
[02:57:16.257 --> 02:57:18.678]  I have case logs and extensive research, and hopefully,
[02:57:19.338 --> 02:57:21.742]  I'm praying, but Philadelphia is buried.
[02:57:21.802 --> 02:57:22.783]  They're all in it together.
[02:57:22.803 --> 02:57:24.325]  The judge, the DA, the police.
[02:57:24.345 --> 02:57:29.633]  Listen, I know personally people that have had their children taken for not vaccinating, and there is no law.
[02:57:30.273 --> 02:57:33.157]  If they're saying the lawless, we're in an authoritarian country.
[02:57:34.031 --> 02:57:34.451]  Unbelievable.
[02:57:34.471 --> 02:57:35.212]  God bless you, Jeff.
[02:57:35.872 --> 02:57:42.797]  Joe Mendez, I mean, this is another victim and now the phones are loaded up with people, we'll have to keep you in the next hour if you can do it, that have been through the same hell.
[02:57:43.197 --> 02:57:46.039]  I mean, and I've watched some of your videos.
[02:57:46.059 --> 02:57:52.143]  You're just talking about what we talk about, not even as hardcore, but they don't like it.
[02:57:52.223 --> 02:57:53.744]  I mean, these are really evil people.
[02:57:54.704 --> 02:57:55.245]  Yes they are.
[02:57:55.445 --> 02:57:55.945]  Yes they are.
[02:57:56.286 --> 02:58:01.893]  And I have a take on why I think that they're doing gun sweeps here in California.
[02:58:02.233 --> 02:58:06.618]  We saw a report a couple of days ago there's a big fire going on in Yosemite.
[02:58:06.979 --> 02:58:13.606]  Now the governor here has called a state of emergency over that fire and says that they are going to cut
[02:58:14.227 --> 02:58:15.168]  Hold on, we'll be right back!

[03:00:23.778 --> 03:00:24.979]  Alright, folks, we're live.
[03:00:25.059 --> 03:00:25.679]  It's 2 p.m.
[03:00:25.719 --> 03:00:26.620]  Central Standard Time.
[03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:28.882]  I've got some more breaking news I haven't gotten to yet.
[03:00:29.443 --> 03:00:34.247]  We're talking to Joe Mendez, who on record had his guns taken that are totally legal.
[03:00:36.169 --> 03:00:47.177]  But they're saying you can't own those anymore, and I see this all over the country, but I've seen people arrested for a duck hunting shotgun in Texas, in Dallas, in Houston.
[03:00:47.277 --> 03:01:02.829]  I see the articles, I was mentioning this, that a neighbor usually sees a gun, or there'll be like a hamburger place even next door to a, in one case I saw, to a gun range, and people see guns coming out and they call the cops there and the cops come and take them.
[03:01:04.401 --> 03:01:10.046]  And in a few areas in Texas or Arizona, I didn't like this, and a few other states, but it even happens in Texas now.
[03:01:10.086 --> 03:01:14.869]  They have billboards up everywhere saying, report illegal guns that show an image of a revolver.
[03:01:16.371 --> 03:01:18.652]  And I had a carpet cleaner start to call the cops on me.
[03:01:18.692 --> 03:01:20.494]  I've told this story a hundred times, I won't tell it again.
[03:01:20.514 --> 03:01:23.696]  I don't know, like 16 years ago, until I called the supervisors.
[03:01:23.716 --> 03:01:25.117]  They said, yes, we know he's trying to call.
[03:01:25.598 --> 03:01:26.439]  He told us to call.
[03:01:26.479 --> 03:01:33.044]  We understand, sir, but he doesn't feel comfortable doing your carpet because I had like a shotgun on a rack before I had kids in my studio.
[03:01:34.503 --> 03:01:36.465]  And I mean, these are gilded people, folks.
[03:01:36.505 --> 03:01:39.347]  They flip out if they see a slave with a weapon.
[03:01:40.968 --> 03:01:42.349]  I mean, they are really conditioned.
[03:01:46.007 --> 03:01:54.513]  It's disgusting, and we've got, of course, our guest on the broadcast with us here today who's been going through all this, Joe Mendez.
[03:01:54.573 --> 03:01:59.557]  And Joe, before you leave us in the next segment, I'm going to give out the link so people can go donate to help you.
[03:01:59.597 --> 03:02:00.898]  But really what you need is knowledge.
[03:02:01.498 --> 03:02:09.424]  And it's not just, you know, we can try to help you, but what's really going to save us is the general knowledge that this persecution is going on.
[03:02:11.804 --> 03:02:23.470]  That this is happening and that there's a silent, secret, quiet war against gun owners that's illegal and criminal that we've got to organize against the fiat attack outside of law on our rights.
[03:02:23.950 --> 03:02:26.631]  Rob in Arkansas has some legal advice he wants to give you.
[03:02:26.671 --> 03:02:27.772]  Go ahead Rob, thanks for holding.
[03:02:28.703 --> 03:02:30.264]  Hi Alex, long time, first time.
[03:02:30.284 --> 03:02:38.851]  A lot of people are unaware that there's a prohibition on the confiscation of firearms that is in law according to the U.S.
[03:02:38.931 --> 03:02:39.211]  Code.
[03:02:39.711 --> 03:02:45.776]  And everyone that is a firearm owner should probably look this up and print this out and keep this with their firearms.
[03:02:46.257 --> 03:02:51.461]  They want to do a search on prohibition on confiscation of firearms.
[03:02:51.981 --> 03:02:52.922]  The section in the U.S.
[03:02:53.022 --> 03:02:54.323]  Code is U.S.
[03:02:54.403 --> 03:02:55.424]  Code Title 42, Section 5207.
[03:03:00.550 --> 03:03:18.693]  And a little history, after Hurricane Katrina and all that gun confiscation went on down in Louisiana, there was such an outrage that David Vitter, who is a senator from Louisiana, proposed what came to be known as the Vitter Amendment, or the personal
[03:03:21.456 --> 03:03:25.661]  That's right, judges got involved and the ATF and all of them got in trouble.
[03:03:25.981 --> 03:03:27.603]  That's right, I'd forgotten about that.
[03:03:27.883 --> 03:03:39.077]  Yeah, the Vetter Act and then there's also, I remember, I mean it's obviously illegal to take somebody's property, period, that isn't illegal, but they try to act like they didn't know and then the ATF does a ruling, but go ahead.
[03:03:39.853 --> 03:03:51.282]  Right, the thing is that this was overwhelmingly approved by Senate by a vote of 86 to 14, and this was actually signed into law by President Bush in 2006.
[03:03:52.142 --> 03:03:53.663]  That's right, the Vetter Act!
[03:03:53.743 --> 03:03:55.004]  I had totally forgotten, guys.
[03:03:55.044 --> 03:03:55.985]  Pull up the Vetter Act.
[03:03:56.045 --> 03:03:58.087]  I mean, there's just so much knowledge with our listeners.
[03:03:58.467 --> 03:04:06.493]  Man, Rob, we ought to have you on as a guest, or get Larry Pratt on the Nightly News or on the show tomorrow, about this secret persecution.
[03:04:07.233 --> 03:04:07.814]  Go ahead, caller.
[03:04:08.891 --> 03:04:30.685]  What I was going to say is that my question to you is, considering the fact that President Bush was just a front man for the globalists, and considering the fact that most of our congressmen are bought and paid for by globalists, why do you think that, since this would be in direct opposition of what the globalists want, why would President Bush
[03:04:31.185 --> 03:04:33.827]  Sign a prohibition on the confiscation of firearms.
[03:04:34.127 --> 03:04:35.848]  Why would the Senate overwhelmingly?
[03:04:36.209 --> 03:04:45.615]  Approve that that's an important point come back restate about the veteran amendment, and then I'll try to give you my answer on that, but the short answer is
[03:04:46.860 --> 03:04:54.424]  Because the will of the people were behind it, and Bush had to at least pay lip service to it.
[03:04:54.784 --> 03:05:00.548]  And by signing it, he was for the assault weapons ban, but he wasn't for the assault weapons ban in a...

[03:08:18.494 --> 03:08:22.576]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:30.194 --> 03:08:37.182]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have read the civil asset forfeiture federal law and the federal court rulings.
[03:08:37.282 --> 03:08:38.263]  I've had lawyers on about it.
[03:08:38.944 --> 03:08:43.048]  It does not say police can pull you over and take your car if no drugs are found.
[03:08:43.908 --> 03:08:48.730]  They just expanded out to say that, and here is an article in the Natural News today.
[03:08:49.090 --> 03:08:52.211]  NaturalNews.com, we have it up on Infowars.com.
[03:08:52.911 --> 03:08:58.314]  Cops nationwide stealing cash, jewelry, valuables from innocent citizens under civil forfeiture laws.
[03:08:58.854 --> 03:09:07.077]  And here is, on the same topic, a New Yorker magazine this month, the August issue, in police states,
[03:09:08.737 --> 03:09:16.084]  Or in most states, police have the right to confiscate possessions like your cash, car, home, even if you aren't charged with a crime.
[03:09:17.004 --> 03:09:18.566]  That is the law, but should it be?
[03:09:19.226 --> 03:09:20.007]  And they're so ignorant.
[03:09:20.528 --> 03:09:22.029]  It's wrong, but I think it's the law.
[03:09:22.089 --> 03:09:22.650]  No, it's not the law.
[03:09:23.130 --> 03:09:28.315]  And all their regulations are trumped by common law, Bill of Rights, Constitution, and our will to say no.
[03:09:29.758 --> 03:09:42.464]  Texas is famous, not just with local jurisdictions, the state police, if an old lady opens up her wallet to give them a license, they'll grab $5,000, even $500, they'll just take it and say, hey, it's up to you to prove it isn't drug money.
[03:09:43.044 --> 03:09:45.605]  Then they'll have a lab test all the bills and find drugs on it.
[03:09:45.905 --> 03:09:47.746]  All old money has drugs on it.
[03:09:47.766 --> 03:09:52.348]  You know, because it's stored in banks that ship the drugs and all the rest of it in the drug dealers.
[03:09:52.608 --> 03:09:53.348]  They all know that.
[03:09:54.609 --> 03:09:56.630]  And the reason I raise this while we're taking calls
[03:09:57.684 --> 03:10:00.152]  is uh... i had forgotten
[03:10:01.075 --> 03:10:06.678]  That the Senate passed the Vetter Amendment, 84 to 16, and that Bush then signed it.
[03:10:07.559 --> 03:10:08.959]  And this is a Larry Pratt statement.
[03:10:08.979 --> 03:10:10.520]  They obviously got our message loud and clear.
[03:10:10.900 --> 03:10:18.164]  It was the most lopsided gun vote I've ever seen, as told by a Senate official to GOA after the overwhelming vote yesterday.
[03:10:18.184 --> 03:10:21.106]  So that's a quote from the Senate staffer to Larry Pratt.
[03:10:21.606 --> 03:10:27.910]  And yes, they needed this, because all over the country people would have legal guns, and the ATF of a neighbor saw it.
[03:10:28.450 --> 03:10:33.977]  And goes, that man has a gun, because of the federal billboard saying report guns, showing a revolver or a shotgun.
[03:10:35.139 --> 03:10:37.843]  And knowing they would get false reports, they didn't take the guns.
[03:10:39.346 --> 03:10:44.011]  This is just like all over the news, they will take people's children if they don't take vaccines.
[03:10:44.051 --> 03:10:58.167]  Now if you go in, you're upper middle class, you fill out a birth plan, say no to vaccines, act like you know what you're talking about, the criminals, even though they don't know they're criminals, it's a criminal training, will case you and go, this one knows their rights.
[03:10:58.547 --> 03:10:59.308]  But if you go in,
[03:11:00.959 --> 03:11:02.742]  And they'll come in and say, you didn't give shots.
[03:11:02.782 --> 03:11:04.805]  The CPS is here to see if you know how to feed your baby right.
[03:11:05.145 --> 03:11:07.509]  And of course, babies always can't nurse perfectly at first.
[03:11:07.529 --> 03:11:09.632]  They go, let's see if the baby does it right away.
[03:11:09.652 --> 03:11:11.295]  Oops, the baby refused twice.
[03:11:11.615 --> 03:11:12.436]  Your kid's ours.
[03:11:13.578 --> 03:11:16.442]  And then tell you they took them because, um...
[03:11:19.012 --> 03:11:29.099]  You weren't giving vaccines, but really they just go to the court and they say, we won't take your kid, just sign this plan to admit that you have done bad and that you'll do better, which is really revoking your rights to them.
[03:11:29.419 --> 03:11:36.885]  And then they literally, like in the Little Mermaid, when the witch gets the document, they go, ha ha ha ha, you'll never see that kid again!
[03:11:38.223 --> 03:11:41.066]  I mean, just the most satanic, murdering scum!
[03:11:41.086 --> 03:11:43.108]  Excuse me, I don't mean to start getting like that.
[03:11:43.148 --> 03:11:50.475]  I'm just so sick of them abusing absolutely everybody across the board in pell-mell evil.
[03:11:51.095 --> 03:11:53.437]  And then to have this caller call in.
[03:11:53.457 --> 03:11:54.699]  See, I've been there, folks.
[03:11:55.279 --> 03:12:00.901]  When I got called by families I was helping, little sweet families open the door and the cops choking the woman saying sign it.
[03:12:01.481 --> 03:12:08.443]  And I have flashbacks that I knew I'd end up in prison and couldn't fight them and Mike came in with the camera behind me, we caught some of it.
[03:12:09.023 --> 03:12:11.724]  A lot of you in Austin have seen that TV report, we've got to dig it up and put it on the web.
[03:12:13.684 --> 03:12:15.125]  I just broke down and cried for hours.
[03:12:15.725 --> 03:12:23.028]  Because I realized, I'm a slave, I'm a piece of filth, I'm dominated by criminals, and they're gonna take kids, and they're gonna do whatever they want to them, and I'm gonna let them do it!
[03:12:23.148 --> 03:12:26.429]  Because they got badges and guns, and they're God, and that's the end of it!
[03:12:27.069 --> 03:12:27.550]  Excuse me.
[03:12:27.690 --> 03:12:36.573]  They're gonna take our guns, our children, our land, our money, our freedom, our future, our health, and we're gonna let them do it because that's what we are!
[03:12:36.593 --> 03:12:37.734]  Excuse me.
[03:12:38.703 --> 03:12:41.225]  I try not to blow up, and I shouldn't blow up.
[03:12:41.325 --> 03:12:43.126]  And this is not an act when I get angry, folks.
[03:12:43.446 --> 03:12:46.948]  Because the crimes being committed against us are so horrible.
[03:12:47.008 --> 03:12:48.689]  I apologize to the guests and the callers.
[03:12:48.709 --> 03:12:49.430]  We're going to get to you.
[03:12:50.791 --> 03:12:52.033]  I gotta settle down sometimes.
[03:12:52.353 --> 03:12:53.775]  Joe Mendez had his guns taken.
[03:12:54.215 --> 03:12:55.156]  It could happen to all of us.
[03:12:55.196 --> 03:12:58.620]  I take it personal what happened to him, because you know it's happened to everybody else.
[03:12:59.501 --> 03:13:03.125]  And the people they kill in these fake raids, they just love killing people.
[03:13:03.326 --> 03:13:06.089]  They're cowards that get to rule us because we're worse than they are.
[03:13:06.790 --> 03:13:08.752]  And I just am just, I just can't believe it.
[03:13:10.193 --> 03:13:10.953]  I'm going to shut up now.
[03:13:10.993 --> 03:13:21.496]  Let's go to Robin Arkansas, who called in with great legal advice, reminding us that they had to pass another law saying you can't take guns illegally, but they don't care because they work for foreign banks.
[03:13:22.516 --> 03:13:23.656]  I'm sorry I'm ranting, sir.
[03:13:24.276 --> 03:13:27.357]  Repeat about the Vetter Amendment, and we're going to repost this.
[03:13:27.397 --> 03:13:31.138]  It's important to know with Mr. Mendez's case and what you would do if you were he.
[03:13:32.768 --> 03:13:38.549]  Well, of course he's already had his guns confiscated, but I believe that, you know, the U.S.
[03:13:38.649 --> 03:13:44.630]  Code is pretty clear that they were confiscated illegally and in violation of the U.S.
[03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:49.812]  Code, Title 42, Chapter 68, Subchapter V, Section 5207.
[03:13:50.372 --> 03:14:01.554]  So that was clearly violated, but what I plan to do for the future, I've got this printed out, I keep it with my firearms, and in the event that they ever do a, try and do a gun confiscation,
[03:14:02.134 --> 03:14:07.258]  I'm planning on just nicely addressing the officers or the soldiers or whatever.
[03:14:07.718 --> 03:14:12.101]  Well, I understand you're here to uphold and enforce the law.
[03:14:12.382 --> 03:14:14.043]  And they'll probably say, darn right I am.
[03:14:14.503 --> 03:14:16.945]  And then I will hand them this section from the U.S.
[03:14:16.985 --> 03:14:18.846]  Code and say, well, this is what the law says.
[03:14:19.267 --> 03:14:22.129]  Please go out and leave me alone and enforce the law.
[03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:32.750]  And even if they still steal your guns, because the Feds said so, because the President's God, down the road it'll be clear in the entire report that you gave them this.
[03:14:34.682 --> 03:14:43.086]  Exactly, and I did send this information to ShowTips at Infowars.com, but seriously, if you own a firearm, you need to look this up.
[03:14:43.126 --> 03:14:46.508]  Do a search on prohibition on confiscation of firearms.
[03:14:46.528 --> 03:14:50.890]  Print this out and keep it with your guns, and take a look at this, Alex.
[03:14:50.930 --> 03:14:51.870]  You really need to read this.
[03:14:52.310 --> 03:14:53.551]  It's really important stuff.
[03:14:53.591 --> 03:14:54.051]  No, no, no.
[03:14:54.071 --> 03:14:54.772]  I remember it.
[03:14:54.892 --> 03:14:55.872]  It's like all the time now.
[03:14:55.892 --> 03:14:59.714]  I've got so much going on that, like, things I knew about, I'm like, oh yeah.
[03:14:59.774 --> 03:15:01.575]  It's like you totally forget.
[03:15:01.755 --> 03:15:03.496]  Plus, I knew it was already in law.
[03:15:04.477 --> 03:15:11.365]  That they can't do this in the code, but they passed more laws being very specific because they're aware of what the ATF is doing.
[03:15:12.126 --> 03:15:16.811]  Or they just announced, well, there's a wildfire nearby, we're taking all the guns.
[03:15:17.152 --> 03:15:21.076]  Mr. Mendez, the victim we have here showcasing, I appreciate your call, Rob.
[03:15:21.356 --> 03:15:24.120]  We're going to go to more calls here in a moment, but what do you think of what that gentleman just said?
[03:15:24.673 --> 03:15:32.818]  Well, I was going to say, the problem with that was that it's a good thing and everything, but I didn't get a chance to present anything.
[03:15:32.878 --> 03:15:40.684]  They just machine gunned my face, handcuffed me, and they wouldn't even, to this day, they won't tell me why I actually was arrested.
[03:15:41.064 --> 03:15:50.230]  And they took me for interrogation and they wouldn't, so I wouldn't even have had a chance to give them that document because I really feel like you said, Alex, they wanted to kill me.
[03:15:50.390 --> 03:15:54.533]  The guys with the machine guns were shaking and their shoes itching to pull that
[03:15:55.174 --> 03:15:56.575]  Well, they do.
[03:15:56.595 --> 03:15:57.817]  They kill a lot of people, though.
[03:15:57.837 --> 03:15:58.317]  They like it.
[03:15:58.938 --> 03:16:01.741]  I'm telling you, I've talked to people that know some of these gun confiscation crews.
[03:16:02.222 --> 03:16:08.589]  They will sit around bragging about, yeah, that old vet, he, he, I came in his garage, he had a gun, I shot him eight times.
[03:16:08.889 --> 03:16:14.276]  He, he, there was crap splattered all, I was talking to one cop about how they bragged how the old man's crap was blown out of him.
[03:16:14.796 --> 03:16:16.418]  Up against the wall, and the cops liked that.
[03:16:16.438 --> 03:16:18.360]  The old man hitting his knees and falling down.
[03:16:18.640 --> 03:16:21.843]  And if people don't believe me, they can watch Inside the LAPD, 1998.
[03:16:22.944 --> 03:16:25.266]  I played this on the show.
[03:16:25.526 --> 03:16:33.314]  They go to a dead vet's house who had a heart attack, make fun of his dead body, say he's NRA scum, and say, I'm keeping these guns for myself.
[03:16:34.535 --> 03:16:36.517]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, we are in trouble.
[03:16:37.483 --> 03:16:38.164]  Unbelievable!
[03:16:38.984 --> 03:16:47.510]  Another thing, I tried to talk to them about my guns are free, banned, and what the agent told me is it doesn't matter.
[03:16:47.630 --> 03:16:50.712]  California has its own constitution on guns.
[03:16:51.857 --> 03:16:54.939]  Yeah, and see I knew that, so I checked state laws and it's not true either.
[03:16:54.979 --> 03:16:59.221]  And I know, they just, look, they want to ban semi-auto 22s.
[03:16:59.781 --> 03:17:01.382]  I mean, these, because they're criminals.
[03:17:01.422 --> 03:17:02.262]  I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[03:17:02.683 --> 03:17:04.583]  Jeff in Illinois, what's your legal advice?
[03:17:04.603 --> 03:17:06.584]  We've got more gun confiscation stories.
[03:17:06.625 --> 03:17:07.025]  Go ahead.
[03:17:07.045 --> 03:17:08.305]  Now they're pouring in.
[03:17:08.565 --> 03:17:09.466]  Hello?
[03:17:09.726 --> 03:17:10.306]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[03:17:10.326 --> 03:17:15.449]  Yeah, well, just to first put it out there, I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I've had
[03:17:19.246 --> 03:17:21.528]  Yeah, more or less, I was just telling them to let Mr. Mendez know.
[03:17:21.548 --> 03:17:23.129]  Like, first off, keep your head up.
[03:17:23.630 --> 03:17:24.270]  Don't give up.
[03:17:24.610 --> 03:17:25.851]  Don't quit the fight at all.
[03:17:26.452 --> 03:17:40.323]  Because, so far, I've always learned, the courts will do anything and everything they possibly can to drag out a case, to make it as long as possible, threaten you, everything, just in hopes that you actually give up and just go with what they want you to do.
[03:17:41.044 --> 03:17:47.209]  So, pretty much, like, the best thing you can do, especially when you're dealing with a public pretender, I refuse to call them defenders, because they're pretenders.
[03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:50.691]  Learn as much as you can about the law.
[03:17:50.711 --> 03:17:53.892]  That's why I liked your last caller who actually had codes for it.
[03:17:54.832 --> 03:17:58.713]  Look up as much as you possibly can and make your public pretender work for you.
[03:17:59.393 --> 03:18:10.737]  One thing I've come to learn in all the cases I've ever dealt with is always, unless you actually can bring it to your public pretender and show them the law, even though they supposedly went to law school,
[03:18:11.823 --> 03:18:13.704]  They won't bring up these issues.
[03:18:13.724 --> 03:18:15.406]  They won't really protect you.
[03:18:15.686 --> 03:18:16.506]  Well, they all know.
[03:18:16.526 --> 03:18:18.508]  They're paid to make sure you get convicted, most of them.
[03:18:18.528 --> 03:18:20.029]  There are a few good ones, but they get run out.
[03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:21.010]  That's on record.
[03:18:21.410 --> 03:18:26.354]  You have to show them in law that they are not giving you a real defense and that you know.
[03:18:27.352 --> 03:18:29.454]  Just like you go in with a pre-plan on your kids.
[03:18:29.474 --> 03:18:30.775]  I'm not taking vaccines.
[03:18:31.776 --> 03:18:32.517]  They know your rights.
[03:18:32.537 --> 03:18:33.397]  They're like, yes, sir.
[03:18:33.418 --> 03:18:35.860]  And then the nurses go, we don't give them to our kids either.
[03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:37.221]  I actually had them do that to me.
[03:18:37.601 --> 03:18:40.864]  But you go in there and act like you're scared, but don't take the shots.
[03:18:40.944 --> 03:18:42.706]  They will take your baby.
[03:18:43.467 --> 03:18:45.689]  I mean, these are body snatching traps.
[03:18:45.709 --> 03:18:47.010]  I mean, they're the enemy.
[03:18:47.270 --> 03:18:49.472]  The government is a legion of filth.
[03:18:50.093 --> 03:18:51.694]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[03:18:52.435 --> 03:18:53.616]  I don't know how else to put it.
[03:18:55.792 --> 03:18:57.673]  They are still.
[03:18:57.813 --> 03:19:01.595]  And just one other point I want to touch on too with the whole gun confiscation aspect.
[03:19:02.075 --> 03:19:06.057]  Personally, I haven't had to deal with it even though I have had the ATF at my house.
[03:19:06.137 --> 03:19:07.778]  Just so happily I wasn't there when they came.
[03:19:07.798 --> 03:19:10.179]  Well that's another big thing.
[03:19:10.239 --> 03:19:11.920]  Don't have all your guns on your premises.
[03:19:12.300 --> 03:19:13.020]  Have them hidden.
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:14.061]  Don't talk to them.
[03:19:14.701 --> 03:19:15.641]  And don't answer the door.
[03:19:15.661 --> 03:19:16.782]  A lot of times they don't even have a warrant.
[03:19:16.822 --> 03:19:19.463]  They will get you to open the door and then shove their criminal way in.
[03:19:21.264 --> 03:19:22.905]  One thing I'd also just want to say is like
[03:19:26.328 --> 03:19:30.412]  Yeah, no, the day after it expires, it hadn't even come in the mail yet.
[03:19:43.226 --> 03:19:45.307]  They will SWAT team in their favorites old people.
[03:19:45.447 --> 03:19:46.387]  Oh yeah, that's incredible.
[03:19:46.647 --> 03:19:53.028]  They have special state police unit of guys that dress up in soldier outfits and then go battle the American people.
[03:19:53.228 --> 03:19:53.789]  Oh yes!
[03:19:54.289 --> 03:19:54.929]  Thank you, Jeff.
[03:19:55.329 --> 03:19:57.769]  Rob in Michigan, tell us your gun confiscation story.
[03:19:58.990 --> 03:20:00.870]  Yeah, I'll be real quick.
[03:20:01.830 --> 03:20:08.272]  I caught my ex cheating, then I told her to get out, changed the locks on the house, went to work out of state.
[03:20:09.107 --> 03:20:14.150]  When I was working out of state, she told the cops I beat her when I got back to state.
[03:20:14.730 --> 03:20:16.111]  They arrested me at my work.
[03:20:17.032 --> 03:20:20.614]  I had to go do trials, you know, jury trials, everything.
[03:20:20.634 --> 03:20:21.574]  I was found not guilty.
[03:20:21.915 --> 03:20:25.497]  But while this was going on, they kicked in my door, took all my guns.
[03:20:26.077 --> 03:20:29.879]  Took me three years to get my guns back, even though I was not guilty.
[03:20:30.259 --> 03:20:30.780]  Three years.
[03:20:32.130 --> 03:20:34.971]  Yeah, that's why you've got to watch who your girlfriend is or who your wife is.
[03:20:36.091 --> 03:20:45.615]  That's why no matter how good looking a woman is or whatever, or how nice she seems on the surface, they'll let you know if they've got a mean streak and make stuff up.
[03:20:46.095 --> 03:20:49.436]  And let me tell you, the minute you've got to drop them like that, just boom, immediately.
[03:20:49.956 --> 03:20:51.757]  Bad women need to be thrown directly to the curb.
[03:20:52.077 --> 03:20:54.638]  Same thing with bad men for women out there.
[03:20:56.232 --> 03:21:01.193]  And that's their plan, to draw it out and bleed you for your money.
[03:21:01.533 --> 03:21:05.274]  Again, this cost me $70,000 just to clear my good name.
[03:21:05.694 --> 03:21:10.616]  That's a standard deal they teach women now, is file a fake report.
[03:21:10.636 --> 03:21:12.196]  I mean, we see it in the news all the time.
[03:21:12.696 --> 03:21:14.197]  It's like the lacrosse team.
[03:21:14.237 --> 03:21:15.197]  That was just all made up.
[03:21:16.237 --> 03:21:17.317]  And it's really bad.
[03:21:17.357 --> 03:21:18.198]  It's really dangerous.
[03:21:18.738 --> 03:21:19.418]  Very dangerous.
[03:21:21.118 --> 03:21:23.039]  I had multiple girlfriends.
[03:21:23.973 --> 03:21:26.675]  Who would get mad if I told him I was leaving or breaking up with him.
[03:21:26.715 --> 03:21:31.758]  He would punch me, scratch me, hit me, and then grab the phone and go, I'm going to call the police if you leave.
[03:21:32.398 --> 03:21:34.059]  And I'd be like, call them then and leave.
[03:21:34.139 --> 03:21:36.480]  But I mean, is that like common?
[03:21:36.520 --> 03:21:37.761]  I hear that's common.
[03:21:37.781 --> 03:21:41.463]  I mean, it's like, man, man, honey, that's, we're done.
[03:21:41.483 --> 03:21:42.564]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:21:43.410 --> 03:21:46.536]  Yeah, and this doesn't just happen to me because I travel when I work.
[03:21:46.836 --> 03:21:47.918]  I've been on the road a long time.
[03:21:47.938 --> 03:21:56.174]  Oh no, I know so many men now where the divorce starts and they just get a restraining order and take your guns without even saying you did anything to them.
[03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:59.972]  Yeah, and then most people don't have the money to fight back.
[03:22:00.112 --> 03:22:06.018]  So again, I didn't declare my name, but they figure you won't spend $70,000 to get $10,000 worth of guns.
[03:22:06.038 --> 03:22:06.399]  Absolutely.
[03:22:06.439 --> 03:22:06.879]  Hold on a minute.
[03:22:06.899 --> 03:22:07.760]  Let's bring up Joe Mendez.
[03:22:07.820 --> 03:22:09.022]  I can hear he was saying something.
[03:22:09.042 --> 03:22:09.482]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:22:10.183 --> 03:22:12.265]  Yeah, that is so, so true.
[03:22:12.806 --> 03:22:17.611]  A lot of the things that I'm hearing right now about I'm married now.
[03:22:17.771 --> 03:22:18.512]  I have an ex.
[03:22:19.171 --> 03:22:21.673]  And, uh, you know, she called the SWAT team on me.
[03:22:21.713 --> 03:22:22.894]  He has guns and blah, blah, blah.
[03:22:23.215 --> 03:22:28.299]  And just because she said so, they came to my house and put their machine guns in my face.
[03:22:28.319 --> 03:22:29.600]  This happened like five years ago.
[03:22:30.040 --> 03:22:35.025]  And, and, you know... Yeah, they just say, they just say, he has guns and I feel threatened.
[03:22:35.325 --> 03:22:36.786]  And some of the women won't even lie.
[03:22:37.006 --> 03:22:37.947]  Well, has he threatened you?
[03:22:38.007 --> 03:22:38.247]  No.
[03:22:38.427 --> 03:22:39.588]  Doesn't matter, your guns are gone.
[03:22:39.949 --> 03:22:41.190]  Now, is that a free country?
[03:22:42.070 --> 03:22:47.035]  The 68 Gun Control Act says felons or people that make threats.
[03:22:49.343 --> 03:22:49.703]  Go ahead.
[03:22:50.744 --> 03:23:00.669]  Yeah, and you know, nothing came about that, but I told the cop, I said, so if she would have said I was Charles Manson and had 30 bodies, you're going to come steal it just because someone said so?
[03:23:01.069 --> 03:23:02.129]  I mean, you have to have problems.
[03:23:02.149 --> 03:23:05.611]  They didn't have a warrant that day, and they busted into my house and everything.
[03:23:05.851 --> 03:23:09.373]  I've been being harassed forever just for being a gun owner.
[03:23:09.813 --> 03:23:14.176]  And you have to be... Well, let me say this, Mr. Mendez, and we've got affiliates in California.
[03:23:14.196 --> 03:23:15.096]  It's a beautiful state.
[03:23:15.536 --> 03:23:16.597]  We're about, you know,
[03:23:18.348 --> 03:23:26.192]  The middle of the state up, very beautiful, nice people, but at the same time, really a spirit of evil there, especially in L.A.
[03:23:26.532 --> 03:23:28.213]  Why don't you get out of California?
[03:23:28.473 --> 03:23:33.956]  You know there's a mass exodus, Hollywood's leaving, everybody's leaving, or at least they're running to the north.
[03:23:36.445 --> 03:23:47.854]  The North is bad too, Alex, but as soon as I'm done with this, if I can get any money out of a lawsuit, trust me, I'm going to a gun-toting state where guns are legal, like Arizona, Texas, somewhere, where guns are legal.
[03:23:48.294 --> 03:23:59.543]  Absolutely, because listen, the authoritarian scum fascists that call themselves the left, they're not the left, they're the opposite of the left, how dare them say that they're like a liberal, like Thomas Jefferson.
[03:23:59.903 --> 03:24:02.345]  I mean, it's absolute imposter stuff.
[03:24:02.786 --> 03:24:05.228]  They brag that, well, we've destroyed California,
[03:24:05.828 --> 03:24:09.969]  And they say we're colonizing Texas and we're going to make it a blue state.
[03:24:10.049 --> 03:24:11.109]  Not that I'm a big Republican.
[03:24:11.490 --> 03:24:13.570]  They're just the lesser of two evils when it comes to guns.
[03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:25.573]  The point is they're here saying we've now literally crapped all over California and ruined many areas of that state and now we're coming here to ruin your area and we're going to take your guns.
[03:24:25.974 --> 03:24:30.255]  And they come up to my wife in Whole Foods and say you shouldn't have three kids.
[03:24:31.255 --> 03:24:31.595]  Wow.
[03:24:31.995 --> 03:24:34.276]  Yeah, oh I mean man, it's like cult members.
[03:24:35.616 --> 03:24:36.497]  Rob, anything else?
[03:24:37.858 --> 03:24:38.518]  No, that's it.
[03:24:38.538 --> 03:24:42.521]  Like I said, just keep fighting and don't let them drain you.
[03:24:42.561 --> 03:24:43.362]  That's the whole thing.
[03:24:43.442 --> 03:24:52.849]  And again, after this, I filed a suit against them and found out that the government was after this criminal police district in Michigan.
[03:24:52.869 --> 03:24:55.371]  I don't want to name who it is, but I think everybody can find out who it is.
[03:24:55.431 --> 03:24:59.414]  But it looks like this has been going on for years.
[03:25:00.215 --> 03:25:00.575]  Oh, no.
[03:25:00.655 --> 03:25:04.258]  I mean, listen, I'm a news guy, so I scan the news every day.
[03:25:05.231 --> 03:25:15.664]  I read about the neighbor saw a gun, or the carpet cleaner saw a gun, or the plumber saw a gun, or the... I've had two of my riders have been SWAT teamed.
[03:25:15.864 --> 03:25:16.204]  J.T.
[03:25:16.244 --> 03:25:17.826]  Cote and one other that doesn't want to be on record.
[03:25:18.988 --> 03:25:23.994]  In the last couple years, when they had realtors looking at their house.
[03:25:25.354 --> 03:25:35.718]  And these weirdo space alien women, there's women in both cases, come in and see a gun case and they go, well, we've got to go, and like two hours later a SWAT team hits you.
[03:25:37.958 --> 03:25:39.499]  We're under total persecution!
[03:25:39.699 --> 03:25:43.160]  You have legal guns in a gun case and here come SWAT teams!
[03:25:43.220 --> 03:25:48.162]  I mean, unless you've seen Mark Dice's videos, you've seen our videos, we're going to keep doing them.
[03:25:48.642 --> 03:25:51.223]  We go to Austin to the liberal areas, the authoritarian areas,
[03:25:52.338 --> 03:25:56.119]  And they will sign, we need a petition for Obama to kill babies up to age three.
[03:25:56.599 --> 03:25:57.459]  We want death panels.
[03:25:57.599 --> 03:25:59.879]  We're going to ban the word paper bag, as Seattle's done.
[03:26:00.219 --> 03:26:01.120]  They all sign it.
[03:26:01.400 --> 03:26:03.100]  These are vicious cult members.
[03:26:03.200 --> 03:26:06.721]  And I cannot describe how dangerous these people are.
[03:26:07.141 --> 03:26:09.501]  I mean, they are the filth of the earth.
[03:26:10.701 --> 03:26:12.702]  They come to your house, you have guns.
[03:26:13.202 --> 03:26:16.642]  Not even scary ones, a pump shotgun, they call the cops.
[03:26:17.042 --> 03:26:18.123]  And the cops come!
[03:26:18.643 --> 03:26:19.803]  And the cops will kill you!
[03:26:21.209 --> 03:26:22.630]  I mean, this is an emergency!
[03:26:22.650 --> 03:26:25.511]  And see, that's what I... My one gift is this.
[03:26:26.072 --> 03:26:28.793]  I see things for what they are, threats, and get upset.
[03:26:29.033 --> 03:26:31.054]  Everybody's like, well, that's just what they do!
[03:26:31.074 --> 03:26:35.817]  You know, if I read one more article, I see them every couple weeks where a veteran gets killed.
[03:26:37.097 --> 03:26:41.280]  It's always cleaning guns in the garage or coming in with guns from the shooting range.
[03:26:42.321 --> 03:26:51.466]  And it'll be, you know, Korean War vet Bob Jones, or you know, whatever the name is, was loved by his neighbors and involved in the community and was even involved in the police charity.
[03:26:52.286 --> 03:26:57.529]  And, you know, the officer cried after he, you know, learned he'd shot the old man.
[03:26:57.769 --> 03:27:00.970]  Sometimes you see that in the news and the cops are all freaking out.
[03:27:01.491 --> 03:27:03.312]  That's a cop who isn't really a bad person.
[03:27:03.592 --> 03:27:04.112]  But why?
[03:27:04.132 --> 03:27:11.596]  But it's still the neighbor that called because they saw the old man with a gun and they're cleaning it in the garage while Martha's inside making dinner, a casserole.
[03:27:12.196 --> 03:27:15.358]  I mean, but a lot of times the cops think it's funny!
[03:27:15.378 --> 03:27:17.660]  And I mean, it's sick!
[03:27:18.580 --> 03:27:19.881]  Oh man, I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[03:27:19.921 --> 03:27:20.541]  Thank you, Rob.
[03:27:20.621 --> 03:27:23.883]  One last caller for our guest that we're going to plug, how folks can donate to him.
[03:27:24.704 --> 03:27:25.845]  And again, he's just one case.
[03:27:25.905 --> 03:27:27.526]  We can't help everybody, but we're just trying.
[03:27:28.326 --> 03:27:29.647]  Malik's in Wisconsin.
[03:27:29.727 --> 03:27:31.048]  Go ahead, tell us your story real quick.
[03:27:31.448 --> 03:27:32.429]  I got so many other calls here.
[03:27:32.449 --> 03:27:36.231]  Okay, I got a quick story, but just don't interrupt me because it's kind of complex here.
[03:27:36.251 --> 03:27:37.272]  I'll go real quick, alright?
[03:27:38.769 --> 03:27:43.912]  So I have this friend named Christian, he's an inverted pyramid type, don't tread on me type.
[03:27:44.313 --> 03:27:50.537]  We made an entry for your film contest and he moved back home to rural Wisconsin due to financial issues and no jobs.
[03:27:51.257 --> 03:27:58.042]  And since he was with his parents, he'd park his car in an empty area, often have some alone time, you know, keep away from his family.
[03:27:58.882 --> 03:28:05.767]  And he was worried since we started filming about shadows, and also as a principal due to all this stuff, he carried without a permit.
[03:28:06.594 --> 03:28:07.594]  Uh, to protect himself.
[03:28:08.415 --> 03:28:10.955]  And, uh, one day, cars came and talked to him.
[03:28:10.975 --> 03:28:12.796]  It was just unmarked cars, strangers.
[03:28:13.376 --> 03:28:15.876]  And he never talked to anybody there, was going there for months.
[03:28:16.317 --> 03:28:25.819]  Then the next day, he was there at night, and some cops showed up and pretty much run up on him, told him to get out of the car for a safety search.
[03:28:26.379 --> 03:28:29.240]  On him found a magazine for a pistol.
[03:28:30.137 --> 03:28:31.358]  Completely changed the tone.
[03:28:31.378 --> 03:28:36.761]  They searched him, found some other stuff, put him under arrest.
[03:28:37.341 --> 03:28:43.945]  And then he was able to get some of the charges dropped under the condition that he couldn't face his accuser.
[03:28:44.505 --> 03:28:48.608]  Now what happened afterwards is that he kind of was feeling a little paranoid.
[03:28:49.369 --> 03:28:54.137]  And like what happened to you this morning with the motorcycle or what happened with you and the garbage truck.
[03:28:55.560 --> 03:29:01.510]  Now you like a couple weeks back he went to a music festival and after the festival he wasn't feeling right.
[03:29:02.213 --> 03:29:07.837]  I decided to slash his arm open and his legs open trying to kill himself to get his femoral artery.
[03:29:32.813 --> 03:29:38.715]  Yeah, you can see my videos on Warrior, the number 4, God number 13 at YouTube.
[03:29:39.575 --> 03:29:42.796]  I got a GoFundMe account, Joe Warrior For God Mendez.
[03:29:42.976 --> 03:29:46.677]  The link to that account is on my channel and on my video.
[03:29:46.697 --> 03:29:47.717]  Alright, God bless you.
[03:29:47.757 --> 03:29:48.178]  Great job.
[03:29:48.198 --> 03:29:49.278]  We'll talk to you in the fall of this.
[03:29:49.298 --> 03:29:49.578]  Thank you.
[03:29:49.598 --> 03:29:49.978]  God bless you too.
[03:29:50.078 --> 03:29:50.498]  Thank you.
[03:29:50.818 --> 03:29:51.719]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.219 --> 03:29:53.739]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.759 --> 03:29:54.639]  Great job to the crew.
[03:29:54.739 --> 03:29:57.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:57.240 --> 03:29:58.380]  Finally news, 7 o'clock tonight.
[03:29:58.400 --> 03:29:59.481]  Be sure and join us back tomorrow.
[03:29:59.501 --> 03:30:00.101]  A lot more to come.
[03:30:01.693 --> 03:30:03.335]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:30:03.596 --> 03:30:07.081]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[03:30:07.241 --> 03:30:11.647]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:30:11.747 --> 03:30:17.776]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:30:17.896 --> 03:30:19.138]  Advanced manufacturing technology.
