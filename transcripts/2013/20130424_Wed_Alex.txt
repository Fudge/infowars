[00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.879]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.066]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:16.888]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:16.888 --> 00:00:18.449]  You want answers?
[00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.010]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.192]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:28.274]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:46.123]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 24th day of April 2013.
[00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:54.848]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to attempt to cover all of this vital and important breaking news today, here in the next three hours.
[00:00:54.848 --> 00:00:57.810]  Lindsey Williams hadn't been on in about six months, and um...
[00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.373]  He said two years ago that the real crisis would flare up in Asia before they move the fleet.
[00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:06.114]  I wanted to get an update from him on what's happening in the world.
[00:01:06.114 --> 00:01:07.435]  He'll be on in the third hour.
[00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:15.739]  I know that is exciting for some and horrifying for others, but Lindsey's always interesting and informative, and he'll be joining us.
[00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:22.723]  Also, Dan Bodondi, InfoWars.com East Coast reporter, privately and now publicly known as the Kraken.
[00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:29.299]  I said, like, Monday, John Ballin walks up and says, do we release the Kraken?
[00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.501]  That's our nickname for him, and I said, yes, release the Kraken.
[00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:38.045]  That was at like 3 o'clock, right after the bombing happened, because he's in Rhode Island, right outside Boston.
[00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:49.692]  So, I mean, that is very interesting, and look right here, if you're a TV viewer, Don Salazar is doing an article on this right now for InfoWars.com.
[00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:51.773]  We all saw this on the high-def television.
[00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:56.807]  We all saw this on the high-def television, and these are screenshots off that.
[00:01:56.807 --> 00:02:08.209]  We're going to grab the actual video, that two bald-headed men came over during the last press conference and got in his face and told him that he better watch it and other things that were threatening.
[00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.750]  And Badandi said, you know, I know the government's a bunch of murderers and you'll be brought to justice.
[00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.791]  I'm not afraid of you, and pointed his finger back at him.
[00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:16.791]  Plus, they didn't know what to do.
[00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:17.832]  He had a bald head as well.
[00:02:17.832 --> 00:02:19.152]  It's like, oh, you've got bald heads?
[00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:21.173]  I've got a big bald head.
[00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:24.316]  In fact, it's three times the size of Tully Savalas's.
[00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:26.698]  And what are you going to do?
[00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:29.360]  There's few people have bigger heads than even me.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.103]  And Dan Bodondi is definitely... No, I mean that lovingly.
[00:02:33.103 --> 00:02:35.685]  I mean, I got a big head too.
[00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:41.911]  But Bodondi, he kind of freaked out the Secret Service because his head was bigger than theirs.
[00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.374]  And, you know, I mean, they bugged their eyes out they got in his face, but here's the deal.
[00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:54.855]  Viewers pointed out that this is Obama's personal top Secret Service guys always seen with him.
[00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:59.320]  And sure enough, we have these Secret Service guys with Obama.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.102]  Document Cam, please.
[00:03:01.102 --> 00:03:03.165]  We have them with Obama.
[00:03:03.165 --> 00:03:05.027]  And it's definitely the same guy.
[00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.394]  Absolutely, chrome dome and all, right there.
[00:03:11.394 --> 00:03:22.124]  So, this Obama sent the Secret Service to try to stop Dan Bodondi, and of course, it failed.
[00:03:22.124 --> 00:03:27.289]  It, of course, completely and totally failed, because Dan Bodondi's bald head is bigger than theirs.
[00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.351]  Again, that's what it comes to.
[00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.632]  Look at the size of the head!
[00:03:30.632 --> 00:03:32.814]  It's got its own way of systems!
[00:03:35.157 --> 00:03:36.998]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:41.319]  I promised to be in a good mood today because I was basically in a controlled rage all yesterday.
[00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.800]  That is not an act, by the way.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.442]  And I have decided to be more friendly.
[00:03:49.442 --> 00:03:51.703]  And I have decided to be nicer.
[00:03:51.703 --> 00:03:55.264]  And I have decided to be nice.
[00:03:55.264 --> 00:03:57.705]  By the way, Jakari Jackson is in the control room right now.
[00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:58.445]  He ran over here.
[00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:01.566]  Are you jealous that Dambadandi has a bigger bald head than you, Jakari?
[00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:04.125]  Yeah, put him on air.
[00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:05.209]  Are you a little bit jealous right now?
[00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.296]  I'm not jealous that Dan Badanti has the...
[00:04:07.972 --> 00:04:10.033]  Actually, I think my head is bigger than Dan's.
[00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:11.133]  Pot!
[00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:12.153]  That's ridiculous!
[00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:13.554]  Preposterous!
[00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:14.874]  Is his more bald?
[00:04:14.874 --> 00:04:18.775]  Because Dan shaves with razors, I shave with clippers.
[00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:19.335]  You know what?
[00:04:19.335 --> 00:04:22.936]  I bet next time he's in town, we will have a contest on air.
[00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:26.857]  We will measure, $500 prize, we will measure circumferences of the cranium.
[00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:30.338]  You want to give a $500 prize for the biggest head?
[00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:30.919]  Yes.
[00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:31.719]  Can we get a tape measure?
[00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:32.939]  Let's just do this right now.
[00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.540]  Who has the biggest head?
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.960]  No, no, you and Badandi.
[00:04:37.832 --> 00:04:40.393]  My head is bigger than... My head's bigger than yours, buddy!
[00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:44.035]  What are you talking... I got a bigger pumpkin than you!
[00:04:44.035 --> 00:04:45.456]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:47.957]  Alright, Jakari... That's not why I came over here.
[00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:48.977]  I had some other business.
[00:04:48.977 --> 00:04:50.098]  You're a little bit jealous right now.
[00:04:50.098 --> 00:04:50.938]  Look, it's alright.
[00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:51.158]  Okay.
[00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:51.879]  It's alright.
[00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:52.959]  Okay?
[00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.280]  Alright, I understand.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.702]  Alright, by the way, the AP and others are trying to imply that I'm basically involved with the bombers now.
[00:04:58.702 --> 00:05:02.343]  So we're gonna cover it all.
[00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:04.665]  They had to blame the Tea Party one way or the other, huh?
[00:05:04.665 --> 00:05:05.285]  Pulled it right back.
[00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:14.583]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:32.475]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:36.598]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:38.619]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:46.785]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:53.109]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:54.390]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.270]  It's incredible.
[00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:04.477]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:06:04.477 --> 00:06:06.318]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:06:06.698 --> 00:06:06.785]  Yeah.
[00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:19.522]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[00:06:19.522 --> 00:06:32.750]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.752]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[00:06:36.972 --> 00:06:40.474]  And perfect for everyday use inside the body as well as out.
[00:06:40.474 --> 00:06:42.095]  The Science Digest Journal says,
[00:07:07.172 --> 00:07:11.394]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:07:11.394 --> 00:07:12.654]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:12.654 --> 00:07:16.516]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:16.516 --> 00:07:18.816]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:18.816 --> 00:07:24.679]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:30.901]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:37.325]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:41.508]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:41.508 --> 00:07:45.791]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:51.755]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:51.755 --> 00:07:55.298]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:55.298 --> 00:07:57.279]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:57.700]  It's here.

[00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:18.009]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:34.675]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 24th day.
[00:08:37.665 --> 00:08:43.368]  Wednesday, the 24th day of April 2013.
[00:08:43.368 --> 00:08:52.914]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here, Lord willing, for the next three hours.
[00:08:52.914 --> 00:08:56.055]  Okay, folks, where to start here?
[00:08:56.055 --> 00:09:03.920]  A lot of developments in the whole Boston bombing situation, pointing towards more government involvement.
[00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:10.904]  At multi-faceted levels, as I was just saying.
[00:09:10.904 --> 00:09:12.905]  We also have big economic developments.
[00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:15.566]  We have big developments in the Ryerson case.
[00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:20.269]  I'm on record saying they'd probably go through two or three different patsies.
[00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:26.352]  That's what they tend to do whenever they've actually launched the anthrax or Ryerson attack themselves.
[00:09:26.352 --> 00:09:29.994]  And with Ryerson case crumbling, FBI targets new man.
[00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:41.008]  And then maybe the third or fourth Patsy will be killed in police custody after confessing, of course, if they follow the standard stuff that they tend to do.
[00:09:41.008 --> 00:09:49.411]  And again, I predicted there'd be some type of bio-attack on the day of the bombing, not this Monday, but last Monday, what, nine days ago.
[00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:52.332]  If indeed it was a staged event, I said we would see that.
[00:09:52.332 --> 00:09:57.494]  We had on the show that day, actor and writer and researcher,
[00:09:58.686 --> 00:09:58.966]  I'm
[00:10:29.207 --> 00:10:30.530]  And that's on record.
[00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:37.426]  They just hope that they call that a conspiracy theory and you don't read the New York Times admitting it or the Washington Post.
[00:10:38.646 --> 00:10:45.433]  Where they've come out and admitted that the FBI foils its own terror plots, but usually stops them before they go through.
[00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:48.676]  In the case of the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, it's on record.
[00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:57.384]  AP, New York Times, Federal Courts, why they had to admit it, because their own intelligence officer, Ahmad Salam, said, you're setting us up.
[00:10:57.384 --> 00:10:59.306]  You're a real bomb, real detonators.
[00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:00.948]  Now you're going to let the bombing go forward?
[00:11:00.948 --> 00:11:02.249]  I'm not going to be part of killing people.
[00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:05.340]  And they said, well, you're going to go to jail then.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:11.483]  So then he freaked out and clandestinely recorded them days before the bombing and after the bombing.
[00:11:11.483 --> 00:11:21.967]  And then he did a press conference and announced it, and that's why he got paid off $1.4 million to go back to Egypt and shut up, instead of being given cement shoes.
[00:11:21.967 --> 00:11:26.569]  And remember that Saudi Arabian that was missing that fit one of the descriptions of the people there at the scene?
[00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:28.110]  He's been found in the river.
[00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:33.446]  Which I again said, I think you'll start finding some of these people in the river.
[00:11:33.446 --> 00:11:38.677]  The question is, was he in the river beforehand?
[00:11:38.677 --> 00:11:40.320]  There was a local...
[00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:55.534]  Muslim leader saying the government was involved in provocateur and terror in Austin, and he bound his arms and legs, slit his wrist, and his guts open, he'd clearly been tortured, and threw himself off the Congress bridge.
[00:11:55.534 --> 00:11:58.695]  And the police immediately said it was a suicide.
[00:11:58.695 --> 00:12:05.098]  I wonder if they would have tied up Breitbart and then slit his wrist and tortured him and then thrown him in a river.
[00:12:06.584 --> 00:12:08.006]  Maybe put him in a steel cage.
[00:12:08.006 --> 00:12:12.291]  Well, he put himself in a cage and had a crane lower him into the river like Houdini.
[00:12:12.291 --> 00:12:15.395]  But he didn't get out.
[00:12:15.395 --> 00:12:16.777]  So we know there was a drill.
[00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:18.098]  They've been caught doing that.
[00:12:18.098 --> 00:12:19.860]  And they're desperately covering up.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.022]  And now we have this.
[00:12:21.022 --> 00:12:22.303]  Senator Chambliss.
[00:12:23.254 --> 00:12:29.078]  This is WSB TV and you would never hear about this if it wasn't up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:12:29.078 --> 00:12:31.820]  You just would never see this local news.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:38.065]  Law enforcement agency may have had info about Boston bombing in advance.
[00:12:38.065 --> 00:12:49.694]  And that's why they hate InfoWars.com and WorldNetDaily.com and DrudgeReport.com and a few other real independent sites is because we'll just point at a local news story that was meant to be compartmentalized and never picked up nationally.
[00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:57.248]  We'll go, hey, they went all over Boston and aimed guns at people and made them come out of their houses and rough people up.
[00:12:57.248 --> 00:12:59.228]  This is unprecedented.
[00:12:59.228 --> 00:13:03.769]  You're supposed to only see it live on TV with them saying, this is a great idea.
[00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:10.071]  Not to hear people either just present it raw or say, is this a good idea?
[00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:11.912]  You're told it is a good idea.
[00:13:11.912 --> 00:13:13.192]  So see, they don't have a monopoly.
[00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:15.012]  That's what the White House said two weeks ago.
[00:13:15.012 --> 00:13:16.193]  They don't like Drudge Report.
[00:13:17.847 --> 00:13:24.290]  What Drudge Report links to, media matters, run by the White House, pulling its hair out on a daily basis now.
[00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.373]  Saying how dare DrudgeReport.com link to InfoWars.com.
[00:13:28.373 --> 00:13:32.055]  That is the White House pulling their hair out angry.
[00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:38.058]  And by the way, we have proof, ladies and gentlemen, that the White House, let me copy Rush Limbaugh here.
[00:13:38.058 --> 00:13:41.099]  I always liked that, even as a teenager, I loved that.
[00:13:41.099 --> 00:13:44.021]  I always wanted to, some reason I wanted to go talk radio, so I could go.
[00:13:45.285 --> 00:13:47.387]  But, uh, I'm serious.
[00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:48.368]  Here I am, ladies.
[00:13:48.368 --> 00:13:51.190]  Well, I always like that, because it's that thing.
[00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.733]  I get a little bit more.
[00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:55.214]  See, I can't actually do it first.
[00:13:55.214 --> 00:13:59.578]  I'll just do it more than one block.
[00:13:59.578 --> 00:14:01.060]  There you go.
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.121]  Is that impressive?
[00:14:02.121 --> 00:14:06.845]  I could do, like, an Olympic paper shaker, just like... Oh, okay.
[00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:16.215]  Well, they got rid of stuff like wrestling that's originally in the Greek-Roman wrestling.
[00:14:16.215 --> 00:14:20.199]  The first thing they did at the Olympic Games.
[00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:22.140]  Synchronized swimming and curling.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.925]  So we can bring back in paper popping.
[00:14:26.925 --> 00:14:28.266]  Paper crinkling.
[00:14:28.266 --> 00:14:29.487]  Look at that.
[00:14:29.487 --> 00:14:30.488]  That's what made him world famous.
[00:14:32.489 --> 00:14:35.030]  Gold winner, Alex Jones.
[00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.352]  Unseating the former champion, Russ Limbaugh.
[00:14:37.352 --> 00:14:40.793]  Here he is going for a record paper crinkle.
[00:14:40.793 --> 00:14:43.515]  Ladies and gentlemen, the judges have stopped.
[00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:45.316]  No one has ever seen anything like this.
[00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:46.498]  No one.
[00:14:46.498 --> 00:14:46.859]  Look at that.
[00:14:46.859 --> 00:14:50.784]  Look at the style, the grace, the different angulations, everything he's doing.
[00:14:50.784 --> 00:14:53.267]  No one has ever had skills of this level.
[00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:53.627]  No one.
[00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:54.368]  Oh my God.
[00:14:54.368 --> 00:14:54.729]  Oh, wait, wait.
[00:14:54.729 --> 00:14:55.950]  He's stopping now.
[00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:56.811]  The judges.
[00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:59.615]  Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.
[00:14:59.615 --> 00:15:00.375]  It's unanimous.
[00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:05.402]  Alex Jones for his eighth and world record gold medal paper crinkling.
[00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.308]  I've decided to be in a good mood today.
[00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:13.189]  Ladies and gentlemen, Adan Salazar is doing an article on this right now.
[00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:14.150]  It'll be out in the next hour.
[00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.251]  Let me just recap the evidence before I get to this.
[00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:18.071]  We know there's a drill.
[00:15:18.071 --> 00:15:19.472]  They got caught lying about that.
[00:15:19.472 --> 00:15:25.755]  Now a senator's come out and said, because he has access to the intelligence, oh, it looks like they knew and did nothing.
[00:15:25.755 --> 00:15:32.538]  Yeah, it came out at the time they had bin Laden targeted at least five times and refused to let drones kill him.
[00:15:32.538 --> 00:15:37.080]  Okay, and I've interviewed the people that were running one of the major operations, Stratus Ivy.
[00:15:38.755 --> 00:15:41.396]  And of course, that's Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer.
[00:15:41.396 --> 00:15:44.377]  We need to get him back on.
[00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:45.637]  That's on record.
[00:15:45.637 --> 00:15:46.277]  And it's the same thing.
[00:15:46.277 --> 00:15:51.379]  And again, a false flag does not mean that people can't be involved, that there can't be Muslim extremists.
[00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:53.639]  The point is, most of the time, that's what it is.
[00:15:53.639 --> 00:16:02.962]  You find people, you wind them up, and then you provocateur them and basically command them as the imam, who's really an FBI asset, to carry this out.
[00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:06.518]  And then, oh, we're going to meet you and fly you out of the country.
[00:16:06.518 --> 00:16:07.559]  It's going to be great.
[00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:09.259]  Or they're part of a drill and you set them up.
[00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:10.480]  We don't know.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.882]  And now they've got a guy who got out of the boat, didn't look like he was bleeding.
[00:16:15.882 --> 00:16:19.744]  There was some blood on the boat where he reportedly climbed in.
[00:16:19.744 --> 00:16:25.727]  And then five minutes later, he's been shot in the neck and bleeding everywhere.
[00:16:25.727 --> 00:16:27.388]  And they have to do a tracheotomy basically on it.
[00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:33.452]  And then now, even though he can't talk, he reportedly admits he did it.
[00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:35.973]  Well, you gotta love how that kind of justice works.
[00:16:35.973 --> 00:16:38.013]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:39.514]  He's in there in a hospital.
[00:16:39.514 --> 00:16:41.134]  God only knows what's going on.
[00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:42.394]  None of the story matches.
[00:16:42.394 --> 00:16:45.915]  None of it fits.
[00:16:45.915 --> 00:16:50.517]  But... None of it matches.
[00:16:50.517 --> 00:16:52.577]  None of it fits.
[00:16:52.577 --> 00:16:55.638]  It's got all the classic tell-tale signs of a staged event.
[00:16:56.223 --> 00:17:03.652]  They're power-grabbing with all this legislation and police state, and now saying you're going to have to all have anti-terror insurance.
[00:17:03.652 --> 00:17:06.896]  The insurance companies run this country.
[00:17:06.896 --> 00:17:13.624]  Oh, got to have government health insurance, got to have terrorism insurance, got to have... I mean, this is indentured servitude.
[00:17:13.624 --> 00:17:14.245]  This is slavery.
[00:17:16.206 --> 00:17:17.947]  This is the takeover of society.
[00:17:17.947 --> 00:17:25.489]  You've got all this and now you've got the Senator coming out saying, well, he saw the intelligence that agencies knew about this and did not warn people or stop it.
[00:17:25.489 --> 00:17:26.530]  Really?
[00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:30.391]  WSB TV, we have that video report coming up.
[00:17:30.391 --> 00:17:35.373]  So you've got all this going on.
[00:17:35.373 --> 00:17:42.916]  And then you've got these photos here off the high def video screen of your TV watcher at Infowars.com forward slash listen, you can see this right now.
[00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:52.281]  And I remember seeing the bald-headed guys come over to him, Dan Bodondi, in the press conference.
[00:17:52.281 --> 00:17:53.762]  He thought they were Secret Service or FBI.
[00:17:53.762 --> 00:17:54.843]  That's what he said on air.
[00:17:54.843 --> 00:17:57.644]  We had him on that day when he took over the three press conferences.
[00:17:57.644 --> 00:17:59.765]  By taking it over, just bringing up real questions.
[00:17:59.765 --> 00:18:01.246]  Why was there a drill?
[00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.467]  Why are you covering up the drill?
[00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:06.709]  And is this a false flag?
[00:18:06.709 --> 00:18:08.870]  I mean, governments have been caught false flagging over and over again.
[00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:09.791]  You've got to ask that.
[00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:11.031]  It is now confirmed.
[00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:11.752]  It's the same guy.
[00:18:12.711 --> 00:18:15.294]  We've even got photos of him with the President at the same time.
[00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:35.693]  It was the secret service of the President, who's trying to get law enforcement authority across the country, outside their jurisdiction of counterfeiting and protecting Puss Ball, I mean POTUS, Poop Ball, Puss Tupelit, or whatever the name is.
[00:18:35.693 --> 00:18:36.835]  I'm trying to remember the proper name.
[00:18:37.904 --> 00:18:38.825]  It's POTUS!
[00:18:38.825 --> 00:18:40.166]  That's right.
[00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:42.548]  But here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:42.548 --> 00:18:44.249]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:47.232]  There he is, right there.
[00:18:47.232 --> 00:18:50.755]  And bugging his eyes out at Badandi, who's right there.
[00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:51.695]  And this other...
[00:18:53.874 --> 00:18:55.415]  Secret Service agent.
[00:18:55.415 --> 00:18:57.116]  And they basically, you know, were threatening him.
[00:18:57.116 --> 00:18:58.657]  I mean, look at this look.
[00:18:58.657 --> 00:18:59.678]  Just the craven.
[00:18:59.678 --> 00:19:01.119]  You're not going to ask questions.
[00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:03.481]  That is so much evidence of a cover-up.
[00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:05.002]  And Badandi said, you don't scare me.
[00:19:05.002 --> 00:19:06.002]  This government's criminal.
[00:19:06.002 --> 00:19:06.783]  We know you did it.
[00:19:06.783 --> 00:19:08.884]  That's what he reportedly said to him.
[00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:11.306]  And look, the look of craven powers.
[00:19:11.306 --> 00:19:12.627]  He's not scaring Badandi.
[00:19:12.627 --> 00:19:14.869]  Goes out of his face real fast.
[00:19:14.869 --> 00:19:19.912]  And there he is with POTUS.
[00:19:19.912 --> 00:19:21.473]  POTUS.
[00:19:21.473 --> 00:19:22.354]  There he is with POTUS.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.523]  What does PUTIS stand for?
[00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:31.886]  PUS?
[00:19:31.886 --> 00:19:32.186]  ORB?
[00:19:32.186 --> 00:19:36.690]  How do you spell out PUTIS?
[00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.231]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:39.372]  We'll fix it.
[00:19:39.372 --> 00:19:42.375]  P-O-O-T-S.
[00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:45.958]  Anyways... Phony?
[00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:49.201]  Phony Occupying Office of Presidency?
[00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:49.421]  Okay.
[00:19:51.497 --> 00:19:52.178]  of the United States.
[00:19:52.178 --> 00:19:52.619]  There you go.
[00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:54.121]  Here, go back to this.
[00:19:54.121 --> 00:20:00.231]  There is Poudis with the Secret Service guy, again, acting all powerful and manly.
[00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:03.315]  Because that's what it's all about, is acting manly all the time.
[00:20:03.315 --> 00:20:03.896]  Acting powerful.
[00:20:04.701 --> 00:20:07.563]  And there's Michelle, right there, leading everyone.

[00:21:36.926 --> 00:21:38.167]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:38.167 --> 00:21:42.730]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:48.534]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:48.534 --> 00:21:52.176]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:52.176 --> 00:21:54.898]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:59.961]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:09.108]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:22:09.108 --> 00:22:11.269]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:17.513]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:22:17.513 --> 00:22:20.975]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:22:20.975 --> 00:22:24.858]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:22:24.858 --> 00:22:26.259]  The fact is, you are.
[00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:27.279]  We all are.
[00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.601]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[00:23:05.204 --> 00:23:09.046]  It's time for a home security quiz!
[00:23:09.046 --> 00:23:22.054]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[00:23:23.095 --> 00:23:25.036]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:27.237]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[00:23:27.237 --> 00:23:33.639]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:23:33.639 --> 00:23:41.662]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:23:42.222 --> 00:23:47.927]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:54.812]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:23:54.812 --> 00:23:56.373]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com.
[00:23:56.373 --> 00:23:58.135]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:24:11.638 --> 00:24:12.279]  All right, folks.
[00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:13.581]  Alex Jones here back live.
[00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:15.703]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:15.703 --> 00:24:17.946]  You know, I tend to, when things get really stressful...
[00:24:19.366 --> 00:24:23.770]  Go into kind of an automatic defense mechanism of making it all a big joke.
[00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:28.734]  I think that's a natural thing that people do, kind of a gallows humor.
[00:24:28.734 --> 00:24:33.438]  It actually freaks me out really bad that in America, and we're going to get Dan Badani back on at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:41.944]  He talked about it last week on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday when he took over the three press conferences with real questions.
[00:24:42.805 --> 00:24:59.232]  And the rest of the compliant lapdog media just didn't look into the drill that's on record happening, didn't look into prior knowledge, didn't look into stand down now being confirmed, didn't look into these guys having multiple aliases and allowed to travel to areas where the West is funding terrorists.
[00:24:59.232 --> 00:25:03.954]  They reportedly were radicalized by people on State Department CIA payroll.
[00:25:03.954 --> 00:25:06.955]  Just like Al Qaeda runs Libya and Syria, the takeover.
[00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:13.172]  We've now got to give our rights up and get terrorism insurance they're calling for today.
[00:25:13.172 --> 00:25:15.354]  That's in CBS News.
[00:25:15.354 --> 00:25:17.196]  CNBC's also covering it.
[00:25:17.196 --> 00:25:25.843]  We've got to do all this because more people on government welfare, government assistance, government protected, it's all coming out.
[00:25:25.843 --> 00:25:31.509]  Just like the shooter at the Aurora situation always has government ties just all around them.
[00:25:32.674 --> 00:25:43.639]  Turned out the Unabomber was CIA, was in MKUltra, LA Times, federal court documents, came out in his defense.
[00:25:43.639 --> 00:25:47.621]  I mean, can there just be one bomber who isn't CIA?
[00:25:47.621 --> 00:25:50.763]  But see, I am cursed with being informed.
[00:25:50.763 --> 00:25:51.863]  It is.
[00:25:51.863 --> 00:25:55.405]  Because I have to sit here and be attacked.
[00:25:56.707 --> 00:25:57.888]  I haven't even gotten to this yet.
[00:25:57.888 --> 00:26:01.229]  I mean, most talk show hosts would open their show with it.
[00:26:01.229 --> 00:26:02.289]  And it's just so bizarre.
[00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:03.550]  I don't know what to say.
[00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:09.952]  Now that I had time to think about it, because BuzzFeed's always calling here and emailing and asking and asking.
[00:26:09.952 --> 00:26:12.694]  And so I said, OK, I'll talk to them.
[00:26:12.694 --> 00:26:15.855]  And they took out of context what I said.
[00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:24.552]  Because they call up and they go, the Associated Press is reporting that he was an InfoWars and Alex Jones listener.
[00:26:24.552 --> 00:26:29.841]  And I said, OK, and I pulled up AP and I said, OK, I'll talk to him because I wanted to get a statement out.
[00:26:30.486 --> 00:26:36.069]  And I said, look, there is a slight chance they could have been listeners, because so many people are listeners.
[00:26:36.069 --> 00:26:38.771]  And instead, they edited it to sound like I'm an egomaniac.
[00:26:38.771 --> 00:26:41.212]  Well, everybody's a listener.
[00:26:41.212 --> 00:26:42.693]  I was simply saying, there is a chance.
[00:26:42.693 --> 00:26:45.755]  I can't say there isn't a chance, because we do have a wide listenership.
[00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:48.716]  And plus, the aunt's a listener, and she says some of the other family is.
[00:26:48.716 --> 00:26:58.162]  But I said, the fact that this guy you're just talking to over in Dagestan and others are saying Alex Jones, I said, I've seen this time and time again, when it turns out to not be true.
[00:27:00.427 --> 00:27:02.408]  And, I mean, they got some of the quotes in there.
[00:27:02.408 --> 00:27:04.829]  You know, the best article put out was by BuzzFeed.
[00:27:04.829 --> 00:27:11.313]  Others totally clipped it, where it was like, BOMBERS INFLUENCED BY ALEX JONES!
[00:27:11.313 --> 00:27:14.375]  THEY DID IT FOR ALEX JONES!
[00:27:14.375 --> 00:27:15.815]  There's gotta be 50 articles out.
[00:27:15.815 --> 00:27:16.936]  I don't even have time to look at them all.
[00:27:16.936 --> 00:27:17.836]  I mean, look at some of these.
[00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:20.658]  Look at some of these headlines here.
[00:27:20.658 --> 00:27:21.498]  Gawker.
[00:27:21.498 --> 00:27:24.280]  Accused Marathon Bomber Influenced by Infowars.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.121]  Bomber Influenced by Infowars.
[00:27:26.121 --> 00:27:28.462]  By Alex Jones.
[00:27:28.462 --> 00:27:29.042]  Here's another one.
[00:27:30.495 --> 00:27:34.616]  Tamerlan believed in basically every conspiracy theory but Alex Jones.
[00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:38.357]  The AP headline is bomb suspect influenced by mysterious radical.
[00:27:38.357 --> 00:27:39.997]  And then Infowars is in here.
[00:27:39.997 --> 00:27:42.658]  It's like, oh, who's the radical?
[00:27:42.658 --> 00:27:44.939]  Matt Drudge tweets kind words for Alex Jones.
[00:27:44.939 --> 00:27:47.079]  One hell of a broadcast in such homogenized media.
[00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:50.820]  And then they try to go, oh, look, he's supporting the guy that supports the terrorists.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.021]  I mean, it's just no end to it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:54.321 --> 00:28:03.167]  And I told you, and you all saw it, every show on CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, you name it, it's gonna be a white guy.
[00:28:03.167 --> 00:28:04.448]  It's gonna be a tea partier.
[00:28:04.448 --> 00:28:05.369]  It's gonna be a gun owner.
[00:28:05.369 --> 00:28:07.730]  And they said, ladies and gentlemen, an arrest has been made.
[00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.353]  Axelrod, who said, big news tomorrow, White House.
[00:28:11.353 --> 00:28:13.094]  No, they're planting the media.
[00:28:13.094 --> 00:28:14.075]  They're a surrogate.
[00:28:15.629 --> 00:28:19.693]  They're sheep-dipped minions out of the White House directly into the so-called media.
[00:28:19.693 --> 00:28:22.316]  I mean, half the pundits now on CNN are former White House.
[00:28:22.316 --> 00:28:25.680]  Same thing on MSNBC, or maybe more than half.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.021]  And what do they come out and say?
[00:28:27.021 --> 00:28:28.903]  Oh, they made the arrest!
[00:28:28.903 --> 00:28:30.725]  You right-wingers are gonna get it!
[00:28:30.725 --> 00:28:31.506]  Oh, you get it!
[00:28:32.984 --> 00:28:34.205]  You did it!
[00:28:34.205 --> 00:28:39.987]  And, oh, right-wingers are probably mailing riots to pro-gun people.
[00:28:39.987 --> 00:28:40.727]  Yeah, right.
[00:28:40.727 --> 00:28:49.311]  And then, oh, the White House has got something suspicious as well, to act like they didn't do it, to act like they weren't involved.
[00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:49.911]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:28:49.911 --> 00:28:55.333]  Alex Jones, InfoWars founder, comments on Boston Bomber visiting his website.
[00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:56.394]  So that's the new guilt.
[00:28:57.199 --> 00:28:58.980]  You know, maybe go look at their hard drive.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.461]  They were visited, uh, Huffington Post.
[00:29:00.461 --> 00:29:01.481]  Well, it's their fault.
[00:29:01.481 --> 00:29:03.903]  They were big Obama supporters, reportedly.
[00:29:03.903 --> 00:29:10.166]  Uh, big, uh, you know, uh, scene-wearing, you know, uh, trendy, you know, kinda liberal type stuff.
[00:29:10.166 --> 00:29:12.307]  It's all your fault, Obama.
[00:29:12.307 --> 00:29:16.009]  And again, why would they send the Secret Service?
[00:29:16.009 --> 00:29:26.475]  Why would they send the Secret Service to the, to the third press conference to go over on the feed before they, you know, went to the press conference itself to come over and threaten Dan Bodondi?
[00:29:27.813 --> 00:29:29.514]  And again, we actually have the hi-def video.
[00:29:29.514 --> 00:29:31.615]  Listeners pointed out these guys are Secret Service.
[00:29:31.615 --> 00:29:33.816]  They wouldn't identify themselves as Badandi, they just threatened him.
[00:29:33.816 --> 00:29:40.740]  There's Dan Badandi, and there they are, everybody saw it, coming over and getting in his face before and after.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:46.243]  And you can see him pointing his finger at him, saying, I'm not scared of you, as they got up in his space.
[00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:54.398]  So he ended up getting his, and they did not want him handing out photos of quote other suspects, which was the government drill.
[00:29:54.398 --> 00:29:56.859]  That's why the FBI said only look at our photos.
[00:29:56.859 --> 00:30:00.761]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:03.422]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:34.541]  Alright folks, I'm going to open the phones up in this hour and the next.
[00:33:34.541 --> 00:33:43.769]  Ahead of Dan Bodondi popping in and then the always informative Lindsey Williams is going to be coming on with us in the third hour, but I will open the phones up for him as well.
[00:33:43.769 --> 00:33:45.130]  I'll do the best job I can.
[00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.971]  Here is the toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:33:46.971 --> 00:33:47.011]  800-259-9231.

[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.561]  Whatever subjects you want to raise, whatever you want to bring up.
[00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:16.453]  But, you know, I'd like to get your take on the younger brother that's supposedly still alive, admits to setting bombs with brother, says source in the Boston Globe, also admits he and his brother Tamerlan were behind killing of MIT officer.
[00:34:16.453 --> 00:34:18.075]  So that's the new system in America.
[00:34:18.922 --> 00:34:28.149]  Where, you know, they arrest you, you're walking, they cut your larynx out, and then you're guilty, and then they put that out in the news, so you can't get a fair trial.
[00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:33.433]  And then everybody chants, USA, USA, USA is due process.
[00:34:33.433 --> 00:34:42.119]  What the USA is based on is flushed directly down the toilet, like the babies at the different abortuaries owned by the Attorney General do.
[00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:43.801]  By the way, Kermit,
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.362]  Not the frog, but the abortionist.
[00:34:48.362 --> 00:34:49.623]  They've dropped most of the charges.
[00:34:49.623 --> 00:34:53.187]  The judge is inexplicably dropping most of the counts against him.
[00:34:53.187 --> 00:35:01.195]  And even the Associated Press, not known for its accuracy or standing up for liberty, had to say, really, no reason.
[00:35:01.195 --> 00:35:01.836]  Inexplicably.
[00:35:03.226 --> 00:35:16.377]  Just, uh, you know, we're talking about nine month old babies, you know, just chopped up, uh, put in toilets and buckets to drown, uh, blood all over the wall, all over the floor, just a filthy stench pit.
[00:35:16.377 --> 00:35:19.820]  And it all came out as women would go there and get so physically hurt.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.463]  You know, I was just, I mean, just imagine it.
[00:35:23.463 --> 00:35:27.647]  And, uh, the demonic ferret Kermit Gosnell,
[00:35:31.235 --> 00:35:32.196]  Unbelievable.
[00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:37.761]  House of Horrors, doctor charged with killing live fetuses with scissors.
[00:35:37.761 --> 00:35:43.446]  You got Planned Parenthood in Florida saying, well, no, I mean, we should be able to get rid of kids even after they're born.
[00:35:43.446 --> 00:35:55.437]  And that's the Journal of Bioethics came out last year, and people didn't believe me when Paul Watson came out
[00:35:56.565 --> 00:35:58.767]  And wrote an article linking to it.
[00:35:58.767 --> 00:36:00.009]  They thought it must not be real.
[00:36:00.009 --> 00:36:02.451]  But see, just a year later, it's like, yeah, what is the big deal?
[00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:03.292]  Death panels are good.
[00:36:03.292 --> 00:36:06.495]  Kill kids!
[00:36:06.495 --> 00:36:07.476]  See how things change?
[00:36:07.476 --> 00:36:09.077]  But here's the toll-free number, 800-259-9231.
[00:36:09.077 --> 00:36:09.137]  800-259-9231.
[00:36:09.137 --> 00:36:10.679]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:36:22.549 --> 00:36:28.658]  Now, I want to go ahead here and plug some new things that are on the InfoWarsStore.com site.
[00:36:28.658 --> 00:36:37.070]  Not only do we have the best products up there at the lowest prices out there in many cases, it also supports the broadcast and everything we're doing.
[00:36:38.231 --> 00:36:42.815]  So, I hope that you will go to the new Seed Center at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:42.815 --> 00:36:48.300]  There's books, t-shirts, films, so many other items.
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.504]  The whole Health Ranger line of great organic products as well.
[00:36:52.504 --> 00:36:53.084]  InnerFood.
[00:36:53.084 --> 00:36:55.747]  I mean, it really is a huge online high-quality store.
[00:36:55.747 --> 00:36:57.028]  The ProPure water filters.
[00:36:57.028 --> 00:37:03.773]  But the new Seed Center has seven different brands at the lowest prices out there.
[00:37:04.554 --> 00:37:08.299]  We either match the lowest price or we've been authorized in some cases to go below.
[00:37:08.299 --> 00:37:11.403]  But this is the lowest price that we've been authorized.
[00:37:11.403 --> 00:37:15.449]  People can sometimes, you know, buy it and sell it on eBay or something cheaper, you know, secondhand.
[00:37:15.449 --> 00:37:19.154]  We have the lowest prices on every one of the... This is a year of research.
[00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:24.740]  The year goes by quick, and I've told Weldon, find out the best companies, do the research, try them out, talk to people.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.844]  And finally, a year later, because my crew's really busy, we have the huge seed center.
[00:37:28.844 --> 00:37:33.189]  Six, or is it seven different companies, and it's all up there.
[00:37:33.189 --> 00:37:34.030]  It's all up there.
[00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.992]  The Family Survival Emergency Seed Bank.
[00:37:37.419 --> 00:37:50.607]  The Urban Survival Emergency Seed Bank, the Deluxe Emergency Seed Bank, we've got the Seed Arc, we've got six, no, seven different, it was six, now it's seven different companies out there.
[00:37:50.607 --> 00:38:00.393]  The lowest prices, all the different choices to compare, one place, InfowarsStore.com, or call toll free, you get the Survival Seed Vault, the Seed Arc,
[00:38:01.474 --> 00:38:04.818]  All non-GMO, non-hybrid heirlooms.
[00:38:04.818 --> 00:38:18.315]  So they have that old-fashioned thing of producing their own seeds in the fruit, in the vegetables, in the different plants so you can replant the next year.
[00:38:18.315 --> 00:38:19.817]  Someday that'll be a conspiracy theory.
[00:38:20.157 --> 00:38:22.818]  Mommy, I heard once there were mommies.
[00:38:22.818 --> 00:38:24.858]  I heard once women breastfed.
[00:38:24.858 --> 00:38:32.741]  I heard once that plants had seeds and grew and didn't come out of a biotech engineering company.
[00:38:32.741 --> 00:38:35.521]  I heard once that children could walk and play.
[00:38:35.521 --> 00:38:36.782]  I heard once we live past 20.
[00:38:36.782 --> 00:38:39.442]  Of course, it won't even get to that.
[00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:44.284]  We'll be replaced with machines and the whole merger with a cybernetic interface, if they have their way, it's all public.
[00:38:45.064 --> 00:38:51.605]  The end of humanity as we know it if the global technocrats to the psychopaths on drooling power trips have their way.
[00:38:51.605 --> 00:39:06.889]  Things are not going to go the way they think they are because we're checkmating them right now, putting their whole agenda out, so when they try to implement it all, people under mind control will still agree with it and go along with it no matter what happens, but many people will not do that.
[00:39:06.889 --> 00:39:08.809]  Many people will go, wait, this was all true.
[00:39:09.963 --> 00:39:15.925]  Wow, you know, they're admitting that, you know, 20 is the new 30 and 30 is the new 50 or whatever.
[00:39:15.925 --> 00:39:25.329]  I saw those studies out last week and they're admitting all the neurological disorders and dropping IQs and exploding cancer and the bisphenol A and the hydrofluorosilic acid.
[00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:31.031]  You know, just 10 years ago, I'd talk about this stuff designed to feminize men, hyperfeminize women, reduce your fertility.
[00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:33.831]  And they would attack none of the media?
[00:39:33.831 --> 00:39:35.092]  Hey, suckers!
[00:39:35.092 --> 00:39:37.515]  The bisphenol A is coming out of most of the products now.
[00:39:37.515 --> 00:39:40.339]  They're passing laws overseas.
[00:39:40.339 --> 00:39:41.080]  Hey, suckers!
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.523]  Countries are banning the cross-species GMO everywhere.
[00:39:44.585 --> 00:39:44.945]  You see?
[00:39:44.945 --> 00:39:49.167]  Because it came out Monsanto's own laboratory and cafeterias won't have GMO.
[00:39:49.167 --> 00:39:51.068]  And the Queen of England won't have GMO.
[00:39:51.068 --> 00:39:52.989]  And the royalty all over the world won't have it.
[00:39:52.989 --> 00:39:55.150]  And the communist Chinese leadership won't have it.
[00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.171]  It's over, suckers!
[00:39:57.171 --> 00:39:59.392]  Go ahead, roll all your stuff out, okay?
[00:39:59.392 --> 00:40:03.013]  Just because you got a bunch of lemmings, it'll go along with you?
[00:40:03.013 --> 00:40:11.357]  Natural law says just because you've got 50 plus percent begging to be slaves doesn't mean I get to be a slave just because you get people voting to make me a slave.
[00:40:11.897 --> 00:40:13.478]  You got that, suckers?
[00:40:13.478 --> 00:40:15.559]  You're the suckers that signed on to evil.
[00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:19.040]  You can go right back to Hades, where you came from.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:30.305]  Anyways, we've got the huge Siege Center, and it'll probably be eight Siege by, you know, eight different brands by next week, but these are the best, the most certified, highest quality, lowest prices, infowarestore.com.
[00:40:30.305 --> 00:40:32.146]  This is part of a big rebellion.
[00:40:32.146 --> 00:40:33.146]  You want to fight the new order?
[00:40:33.146 --> 00:40:34.127]  Don't fight with your wife.
[00:40:34.127 --> 00:40:36.488]  Don't fight with your husband.
[00:40:36.488 --> 00:40:37.768]  Get your kids off television.
[00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:38.669]  Get them off GMO.
[00:40:39.929 --> 00:40:40.930]  Take care of your neighbors.
[00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:43.031]  Forgive your enemies who aren't really evil.
[00:40:43.031 --> 00:40:45.913]  If somebody's just dumb and weird, help them out.
[00:40:45.913 --> 00:40:49.555]  But if they're super evil, obviously expose them and fight what they're doing.
[00:40:49.555 --> 00:40:52.876]  But get rid of old petty grudges that don't matter.
[00:40:52.876 --> 00:40:54.177]  Go to the next level.
[00:40:54.177 --> 00:40:55.798]  Plant seeds in your backyard.
[00:40:55.798 --> 00:40:58.019]  Drink filtered water.
[00:40:58.019 --> 00:41:00.801]  Give fruit and vegetables to your friends and neighbors.
[00:41:00.801 --> 00:41:02.482]  Get them into planting seeds.
[00:41:02.482 --> 00:41:03.863]  Become human again.
[00:41:03.863 --> 00:41:06.804]  Get back to what happened pre-technocracy, pre-1960s.
[00:41:09.022 --> 00:41:10.783]  Revolt against the Matrix.
[00:41:10.783 --> 00:41:15.106]  Rediscover your humanity.
[00:41:15.106 --> 00:41:24.773]  Just the act of gardening, as I've told you so many times, is so human, the agrarian instinct, that it just activates all these other basic human instincts.
[00:41:24.773 --> 00:41:26.934]  That's why they don't want you doing it.
[00:41:26.934 --> 00:41:29.896]  Again, Oblivion even talks about that.
[00:41:29.896 --> 00:41:31.037]  This is the reality.
[00:41:33.319 --> 00:41:34.699]  This is what we're dealing with.
[00:41:34.699 --> 00:41:37.020]  Everyone knows these universal truths.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.420]  What's the movie with Kurt Russell?
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.481]  Universal Soldier?
[00:41:40.481 --> 00:41:42.081]  Where he finally breaks his programming?
[00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:43.422]  Gardening?
[00:41:43.422 --> 00:41:46.923]  And people make fun of that stuff.
[00:41:46.923 --> 00:41:49.003]  Anybody who goes out and digs in the dirt knows what I'm talking about.
[00:41:49.003 --> 00:41:50.864]  Anybody that goes that way down.
[00:41:50.864 --> 00:41:53.905]  But Jean-Claude Van Damme had one by the same name.
[00:41:53.905 --> 00:41:54.885]  It's a very similar name.
[00:41:54.885 --> 00:41:55.965]  It's something soldier.
[00:41:55.965 --> 00:41:58.326]  It's a pretty good movie, actually.
[00:41:58.326 --> 00:41:59.226]  Pretty good for a B-movie.
[00:41:59.226 --> 00:42:00.187]  I love Kurt Russell, man.
[00:42:00.187 --> 00:42:01.207]  Oh, I love him in The Thing.
[00:42:02.093 --> 00:42:04.454]  You know, there's not many actors I want to meet, and I've met a lot of them.
[00:42:04.454 --> 00:42:06.135]  It kind of spoils it.
[00:42:06.135 --> 00:42:08.337]  But, I mean, I would love to meet Kurt Russell.
[00:42:08.337 --> 00:42:13.080]  I actually had a chance to go to the premiere of one of the Grindhouse movies and meet him, and I didn't do it.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:13.680]  You know, it's funny.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.642]  People you really want to meet or talk to, you don't want to.
[00:42:16.642 --> 00:42:28.889]  You know, it's like, I know where... You know, a lot of people hang out and go in Austin and stuff, and if I find out some famous person eats at a restaurant... It's just called Soldier, 1998.
[00:42:28.889 --> 00:42:29.249]  There you go.
[00:42:33.124 --> 00:42:42.250]  Uh, and then I almost won't go there because I don't want to run into him.
[00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.991]  And, you know, it's kind of like Drudge.
[00:42:44.991 --> 00:42:52.516]  That's why I really admire Drudge, all he's done, trailblazing, having the courage to really expose the New World Order more and more, the first to expose Bilderberg.
[00:42:52.516 --> 00:42:55.958]  I mean, just six, seven years ago, they said Bilderberg still didn't exist in America.
[00:42:55.958 --> 00:42:58.460]  And Drudge started posting links about it and broke the blockade.
[00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:00.935]  I mean, that's a big deal.
[00:43:00.935 --> 00:43:02.076]  And he has courage.
[00:43:02.076 --> 00:43:03.218]  So I admire that.
[00:43:03.218 --> 00:43:15.211]  And then Drudge tweeted yesterday saying, you know, I've told friends privately, because I've been told this by some famous people that have talked to Drudge, they go, you know, Drudge really likes you and says, you know, you're going to end up being, you know, just incredibly, you know, effective and famous and all this.
[00:43:15.211 --> 00:43:16.753]  He's a smart guy.
[00:43:16.753 --> 00:43:18.355]  I guess he can see trends.
[00:43:18.355 --> 00:43:19.717]  And I've been told that by a few people.
[00:43:21.753 --> 00:43:24.654]  Um, I won't say their names, even though they didn't say it was off record.
[00:43:24.654 --> 00:43:29.677]  And then sure enough, he sends a tweet out saying, privately told friends, would be year of Alex Jones.
[00:43:29.677 --> 00:43:34.599]  Never met or talked to the man, but one hell of a broadcast in such a homogenized media.
[00:43:34.599 --> 00:43:38.541]  And you know, again, I know I could get ahold of Drudge.
[00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:39.602]  He knows he could get ahold of me.
[00:43:39.602 --> 00:43:42.143]  Cause I've actually talked to some of his crew before.
[00:43:42.143 --> 00:43:42.863]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:43:42.863 --> 00:43:44.344]  Uh, and
[00:43:46.226 --> 00:43:48.510]  We just, neither one ever try to talk to the other one.
[00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:56.101]  Because it's, I understand, I don't... It's almost like... It's just you don't want to ruin it, you know what I mean?
[00:43:56.101 --> 00:44:00.088]  But, if Drudge ever comes through Austin, we'll take him out shooting and for barbecue.
[00:44:00.088 --> 00:44:01.289]  I think that's probably the best thing.
[00:44:02.305 --> 00:44:11.775]  So you're invited to come to Texas, if you're ever driving through on one of your road trips in your Corvettes and want to go out shooting and barbecue, you're invited.
[00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:19.103]  But no need to break the silence.
[00:44:19.103 --> 00:44:23.728]  It's the opposite with me up here, gibbering, streaming consciousness, and then it's just different.
[00:44:25.043 --> 00:44:25.764]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[00:44:25.764 --> 00:44:28.809]  I know people that are neighbors to Robert Plant.
[00:44:28.809 --> 00:44:29.790]  I know his driver.
[00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:35.138]  I know where he goes and watches the team he owns, the soccer team.
[00:44:35.138 --> 00:44:38.102]  And I have a friend who's become kind of friends with him.
[00:44:39.397 --> 00:44:46.702]  Because they're soccer fans, and I just would never... If I saw Robert Plant at a restaurant, I don't think I'd go up and talk to him.
[00:44:46.702 --> 00:44:55.968]  And again, it's not that I'm even intimidated by Robert Plant, it's just that I like his voice and his music so much over the years, growing up with it, that it's almost like I'm not meant to talk to him.
[00:44:55.968 --> 00:44:57.489]  I don't know how to explain that.
[00:44:57.489 --> 00:44:58.270]  See, I'm now digressing.
[00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:59.871]  We've got all these loaded phones.
[00:44:59.871 --> 00:45:01.152]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[00:45:01.152 --> 00:45:02.793]  I'm so neurotic, I can't seem to do it.
[00:45:04.634 --> 00:45:05.976]  Let me just say this separately.
[00:45:05.976 --> 00:45:07.918]  I'm on quite an adventure here.
[00:45:07.918 --> 00:45:11.381]  I know I'm real.
[00:45:11.381 --> 00:45:15.565]  And I know that we're having a big effect and really changing history right now.
[00:45:15.565 --> 00:45:23.193]  And having the White House attack us and go after us and dirty tricks and things I won't even get into on air.
[00:45:23.193 --> 00:45:24.755]  I know how real this is.
[00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:26.597]  And I see people conditioned to go along with it.
[00:45:27.608 --> 00:45:33.213]  But we do appreciate your support, spreading the word, because we're going to, you know, risk our lives and treasure and names in this.
[00:45:33.213 --> 00:45:34.854]  Might as well try to beat the globalists, you know.
[00:45:34.854 --> 00:45:35.795]  Might as well go all the way.
[00:45:35.795 --> 00:45:39.298]  I mean, I don't want to fail at this, and I know we can win.
[00:45:39.298 --> 00:45:42.301]  It's that idea that we can't win against evil is why evil wins.
[00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:46.264]  Every time people figure out they don't have a choice and have to fight back, they end up defeating evil.
[00:45:46.264 --> 00:45:48.366]  Because evil falls in and of itself.
[00:45:48.366 --> 00:45:53.050]  That's why it tries to sell evil, to make you evil, so that you're weak.
[00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:54.211]  So that you don't resist evil.
[00:45:55.826 --> 00:46:07.136]  But when you've got the Secret Service, and the report's going up in the next 20 minutes at InfoWars.com, and we're going to find the videos of the third press conference and, you know, show those so you can match them up to this.
[00:46:07.136 --> 00:46:09.658]  They're all over the place online.
[00:46:09.658 --> 00:46:11.479]  And we'll do a report on the Nightly News about this as well.
[00:46:11.479 --> 00:46:20.347]  To have the Secret Service come over and threaten Badandi, and tell him that he better not ask questions, and that he better watch it and stuff, and get in his space, and have him stand up to him.
[00:46:21.517 --> 00:46:21.817]  I don't know.
[00:46:44.104 --> 00:46:48.148]  Well that isn't a southern gentry name, I don't know what is.
[00:46:48.148 --> 00:46:56.937]  And a New Hampshire lawmaker says Boston bombing was a government job and that it's because of me.
[00:46:56.937 --> 00:46:59.240]  Now a lawmaker in
[00:47:03.826 --> 00:47:07.110]  In New Hampshire, I'm going to try to get her on.
[00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:13.518]  The social media ramblings of a woman who read about conspiracy theory on InfoWars wouldn't usually be newsworthy, but it's the case.
[00:47:13.518 --> 00:47:18.684]  The woman is a lawmaker in New Hampshire State Legislature who thinks the government is responsible for the Boston bombings.
[00:47:18.684 --> 00:47:20.647]  Three-term Republican Representative Stella
[00:47:23.103 --> 00:47:38.715]  Turnblay, I believe you pronounce it, first made her case in a, scare quotes, saturating Facebook post on Friday, writing to Glenn Beck, she said, just as you said would happen, top down, bottom up, the Boston Marathon was a black ops terrorist attack.
[00:47:38.715 --> 00:47:43.319]  One suspect killed, the other one, maybe two before they even have a chance to speak.
[00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:45.581]  Oh, notice they cut out his throat, so that happened.
[00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:47.522]  He's walking out of the boat and then.
[00:47:47.522 --> 00:47:50.365]  Drones are now terrorist attacks.
[00:47:52.534 --> 00:47:54.556]  By our own government.
[00:47:54.556 --> 00:47:56.357]  Sad day, but wake up to all of us.
[00:47:56.357 --> 00:47:59.379]  First there was a suspect, then there wasn't.
[00:47:59.379 --> 00:48:06.425]  Infowars broke the story, and they knew they had been found out.
[00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:13.570]  And then the New York magazine demonizes and attacks that.
[00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.952]  And again, they're all over the news.
[00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:19.600]  The Tamerlan linked in for conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.341]  Alleged Boston Bomber was Alex Jones' conspiracy fan.
[00:48:23.341 --> 00:48:24.502]  On and on and on.
[00:48:24.502 --> 00:48:26.923]  All because... All because...
[00:48:28.274 --> 00:48:46.188]  The media, the Associated Press, who said there were WMDs in Iraq and said that there weren't bullets, but then there were bullets, and the Associated Press caught pushing propaganda a million times, now just talks to somebody from overseas and, well, yeah, I think he visited InfoWars.com.
[00:48:46.188 --> 00:48:47.069]  Well, it's my fault.
[00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:50.892]  See, I told you they wanted to blame the Tea Party one way or another.
[00:48:53.644 --> 00:48:54.685]  One way or another.
[00:48:54.685 --> 00:48:55.585]  Who has that song?
[00:48:55.585 --> 00:48:57.567]  One way or another.
[00:48:57.567 --> 00:49:02.210]  I'm gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha.
[00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.810]  I know who that is.
[00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:06.573]  It's gonna pop in my head in just a minute.
[00:49:06.573 --> 00:49:07.073]  It doesn't matter.
[00:49:07.073 --> 00:49:09.755]  You just type it into the search engine and it'll tell you.
[00:49:09.755 --> 00:49:10.836]  I mean, one way or another.
[00:49:10.836 --> 00:49:11.937]  They want to throw it back on us.
[00:49:11.937 --> 00:49:13.958]  See, I'm saying they have a history of this.
[00:49:13.958 --> 00:49:15.339]  They're the number one suspects.
[00:49:15.339 --> 00:49:16.380]  And then there's a drill.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:19.242]  And the senator says it looks like they knew and didn't stop it.
[00:49:19.242 --> 00:49:19.922]  Duh!
[00:49:19.922 --> 00:49:21.863]  But see, I'm wrong because I'm dangerous.
[00:49:21.863 --> 00:49:22.504]  Because I'm right.
[00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:24.607]  Blondie.
[00:49:24.607 --> 00:49:26.668]  Thank you, that's what I thought.
[00:49:26.668 --> 00:49:28.829]  So this is the type of stuff we're talking about.
[00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:36.292]  So yes, I'm in danger of being demonized, attacked, shut up, you name it.
[00:49:36.292 --> 00:49:38.032]  I'm not gonna even get into it.
[00:49:38.032 --> 00:49:40.553]  The point is, is that this is real.
[00:49:40.553 --> 00:49:48.116]  And if they have a history of it, how do they say it's crazy to go, hey, we should look at who's been caught doing Gulf of Tonkin, Ajax, Northwoods.
[00:49:49.448 --> 00:49:52.410]  The government cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, gave them the detonators, let them do it.
[00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:54.651]  World Trade Center attack, 1993.
[00:49:54.651 --> 00:49:56.132]  Oh, shut up, that's your opinion.
[00:49:56.132 --> 00:49:56.632]  No, it's not.
[00:49:56.632 --> 00:49:57.653]  It came out in federal court.
[00:49:57.653 --> 00:50:00.954]  It's admitted.
[00:50:00.954 --> 00:50:07.398]  I mean, it just comes out the 7-7 bombing mastermind was an MI6 agent, and the media spins it and goes, he must have been a double agent.
[00:50:07.398 --> 00:50:11.040]  And our government's funding al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.362]  There's the New York Times, terrorist plots hatched by the FBI.
[00:50:14.362 --> 00:50:14.602]  April 28, 2012.
[00:50:17.262 --> 00:50:23.605]  Goes on to say, most plots were completely created, manufactured, and authorized, and funded, and run, and commanded.
[00:50:23.605 --> 00:50:27.167]  Commanded.
[00:50:27.167 --> 00:50:28.228]  By the New World Order.
[00:50:28.228 --> 00:50:31.889]  Global, shadowy corporations, manipulating our governments.
[00:50:31.889 --> 00:50:33.650]  And of course they run the radical Muslims.
[00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:35.451]  And of course they run the police state here.
[00:50:35.451 --> 00:50:40.514]  They put radical Muslims in to undermine secular Muslim governments, so that they never get a civilization.
[00:50:40.514 --> 00:50:41.955]  That's part of the public plan.
[00:50:41.955 --> 00:50:43.055]  Clash of civilizations.
[00:50:43.055 --> 00:50:45.136]  Strategy of tension.
[00:50:45.136 --> 00:50:46.617]  And over here they use the Muslim threat,
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:56.227]  In every case, the terrorists are on government welfare, they're protected, the government knows, they attack us, and the government says, hey, Alex, you're gonna have to buy any terrorism insurance now.
[00:50:56.227 --> 00:50:57.889]  We're gonna put you on a no-fly list.
[00:50:57.889 --> 00:50:59.810]  We're gonna stick our hands down your pants.

[00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:06.236]  You're the captured government!
[00:51:08.274 --> 00:51:11.655]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.

[00:54:17.197 --> 00:54:20.518]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:54:28.904 --> 00:54:36.432]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Russian mainstream media is now leaking why the Russians called for an FBI investigation of Tamerlan.
[00:54:37.557 --> 00:54:40.899]  Tsarnaev, or Tsarnaev, or however you pronounce it.
[00:54:40.899 --> 00:54:43.220]  They are now coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:44.820]  Document cam, please.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:50.363]  This is in the mainline Russian news, and been picked up all across Russia.
[00:54:50.363 --> 00:54:54.184]  Tamerlan recruited via the Georgetown Foundation.
[00:54:54.184 --> 00:54:55.405]  Jamestown, U.S.
[00:54:55.405 --> 00:55:00.747]  non-profit, the board of directors of NGOs, previously entered one of the ideologists of U.S.
[00:55:00.747 --> 00:55:06.050]  foreign policy, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who calls for using terror states up against Russia.
[00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:14.214]  Was engaged in recruiting residents of North Caucasus to work in the interest of the United States and Georgia.
[00:55:14.214 --> 00:55:17.496]  And that's why he had an alias that's confirmed.
[00:55:17.496 --> 00:55:19.937]  That's why the family said it must be a setup.
[00:55:19.937 --> 00:55:25.621]  Because the family are pretty, you know, some of them are some heavy hitter lawyers and people working for oil companies.
[00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:29.343]  And this is huge because Kurt Nemo wrote an article on Saturday
[00:55:30.183 --> 00:55:35.047]  He even listed the Jamestown group, because that's the group they use.
[00:55:35.047 --> 00:55:44.894]  And if this is confirmed, and the Russians are saying it is, and of course he had aliases and things, this is a smoking gun of information.
[00:55:44.894 --> 00:55:53.199]  So all you've got to do is put Tamerlan recruited via the Georgian Foundation, and it'll come up for you on the search engine.
[00:55:53.199 --> 00:55:55.921]  I said I'd go to calls, and I will.
[00:55:55.921 --> 00:55:57.202]  This is big breaking news.
[00:55:57.202 --> 00:55:59.024]  Ask Kurt Nemo to print me his Saturday article.
[00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:22.211]  uh... and there it is uh... Tamerlan Czarnev recruited via the Georgian Foundation and Georgia of course has been uh... the main hotspot to train Muslim terrorists to attack the Russian held areas and again I'm no fan of Vladimir Putin or what they're doing that's another tyranny but the West the bankers
[00:56:22.871 --> 00:56:38.220]  Are funding radical Islam in Chechnya, in Dagestan, in Georgia, just everywhere to bomb and blow up Russian facilities on the borders and in Russian held areas like Dagestan and Chechnya.
[00:56:39.182 --> 00:56:39.962]  And it's a fact.
[00:56:39.962 --> 00:56:44.203]  I mean, I mean, these are playboy guys who thought they were part of a drill.
[00:56:44.203 --> 00:56:47.804]  And then that's why he climbs out of the boat and there's no blood on his neck or shirt.
[00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:50.384]  He walks over and they go, lay down, little baby.
[00:56:50.384 --> 00:56:51.265]  Here's the shot.
[00:56:51.265 --> 00:56:55.005]  Give me that skeletal.
[00:56:55.005 --> 00:56:58.706]  And then they are coming out saying.
[00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:02.167]  Right now, oh, the younger brother.
[00:57:03.374 --> 00:57:05.836]  Admits to setting bombs with brother.
[00:57:05.836 --> 00:57:16.343]  Source says, if they've ever got me in jail and they've cut my larynx out, and they just come out in the Boston Globe or the Austin Merritt Statement or wherever and just say, Alex Jones admits he blew up the Capitol.
[00:57:16.343 --> 00:57:19.185]  Alex Jones admits he ran over the little kids.
[00:57:19.185 --> 00:57:22.147]  Alex Jones admits he, you know, Alex Jones wrote a suicide note.
[00:57:22.147 --> 00:57:23.287]  He committed suicide.
[00:57:23.287 --> 00:57:25.429]  No, no, no.
[00:57:25.429 --> 00:57:26.890]  And look, we're the only ones on the trail.
[00:57:27.967 --> 00:57:35.811]  And that's why they're demonizing us, and that's why they're demonizing things like DrudgeReport.com, because he's got the huevos to, you know, to push some of the stuff we're putting out.
[00:57:35.811 --> 00:57:37.052]  Because it makes sense.
[00:57:37.052 --> 00:57:41.434]  And now, there was a drill, the senator says there's evidence, they knew and let it happen.
[00:57:41.434 --> 00:57:42.294]  No kidding.
[00:57:42.294 --> 00:57:44.555]  Oh, but I thought I'm the conspiracy theorist.
[00:57:44.555 --> 00:57:46.456]  Who stands to gain from this?
[00:57:46.456 --> 00:57:48.337]  Who has a history of this?
[00:57:48.337 --> 00:57:50.038]  Who's been caught doing it over and over again?
[00:57:50.038 --> 00:57:51.159]  I mean, we'd be idiots!
[00:57:52.381 --> 00:58:01.908]  If we didn't have lawmakers that would take our liberties and give hundreds of billions of dollars in domestic contracts to their own families when there was a terror attack, they wouldn't be doing this.
[00:58:01.908 --> 00:58:08.953]  A free country doesn't get rid of its liberties because three people get blown up or two cops get shot.
[00:58:08.953 --> 00:58:11.055]  A free country doesn't give in to terrorism.
[00:58:11.055 --> 00:58:15.918]  The only people that would tell you give in to terrorism and give up your liberty are the terrorists.
[00:58:15.918 --> 00:58:17.219]  Duh!
[00:58:17.219 --> 00:58:17.680]  Duh!
[00:58:19.107 --> 00:58:20.447]  Why do terrorists stage terrorism?
[00:58:20.447 --> 00:58:22.228]  To get a political goal.
[00:58:22.228 --> 00:58:22.788]  And what's that?
[00:58:22.788 --> 00:58:23.428]  Power.
[00:58:23.428 --> 00:58:25.029]  Put us in power.
[00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:26.129]  They're in power.
[00:58:26.129 --> 00:58:36.553]  And they want to get rid of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and they're creating terror attacks, they're manufacturing them, they're provocateuring them, they are funding them, they are commanding them.
[00:58:36.553 --> 00:58:38.113]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:58:38.113 --> 00:58:40.434]  This is incredible news.
[00:58:40.434 --> 00:58:41.934]  Of course he was on an NGO.
[00:58:41.934 --> 00:58:43.915]  They had aliases!
[00:58:43.915 --> 00:58:46.096]  They work for the New World Order!
[00:58:50.576 --> 00:58:58.142]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:58.142 --> 00:58:59.223]  I had tried everything.
[00:58:59.223 --> 00:59:04.688]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:59:04.688 --> 00:59:09.532]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:59:09.532 --> 00:59:15.917]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:59:16.377 --> 00:59:27.607]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:59:27.607 --> 00:59:32.071]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:59:32.071 --> 00:59:38.337]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:59:38.337 --> 00:59:39.478]  Now, that's results.
[00:59:39.898 --> 00:59:52.403]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products, and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[00:59:52.403 --> 00:59:54.964]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[00:59:54.964 --> 01:00:00.646]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:00:00.646 --> 01:00:03.027]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:03.027 --> 01:00:05.788]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.352 --> 01:00:17.176]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:17.176 --> 01:00:18.758]  You want answers?
[01:00:18.758 --> 01:00:20.319]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:20.319 --> 01:00:24.503]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.503 --> 01:00:28.567]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.889 --> 01:00:32.049]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:32.049 --> 01:00:37.312]  I'll do what I said I'd do, and I'll cover news at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:37.312 --> 01:00:38.813]  Dan Bodondi calling us.
[01:00:38.813 --> 01:00:39.953]  I'll go to your phone calls now.
[01:00:39.953 --> 01:00:40.493]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:40.493 --> 01:00:46.997]  Coming up, Judge Janet Napolitano, you have to deport illegal immigrants.
[01:00:46.997 --> 01:00:51.939]  And in Florida, a food stamp recruiter deals with wrenching choices.
[01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:56.221]  Washington Post talks about the government recruiting more people onto welfare.
[01:00:56.221 --> 01:00:57.482]  Because they want to bankrupt the country.
[01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:00.639]  Okay.
[01:01:00.639 --> 01:01:10.504]  And also Napolitano now admits the Saudi student was put on the watch list, even though she denied that previously and said that they weren't deporting him, though now they are.
[01:01:10.504 --> 01:01:13.206]  I mean, just a pack of liars.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:19.305]  800-259-1931, we'll get you up on air.
[01:01:19.305 --> 01:01:25.613]  The big news is the AP came out with no proof, said they talked to somebody overseas.
[01:01:25.613 --> 01:01:29.297]  Oh, and the brothers liked Infowars.com.
[01:01:29.297 --> 01:01:33.202]  And the media ran with that, and now they're my biggest fans, and that I caused the bombing.
[01:01:34.651 --> 01:01:39.855]  And of course, I'm saying we should look at the globalists who stand against this and have a history of it, and, oh, there is a drill, and the U.S.
[01:01:39.855 --> 01:01:50.563]  Senator now says, looks like they knew and let it happen, that's mainstream news, but, see, I'm, it doesn't matter, I'm, folks, I'm the terrorist, I mean, you know, come on.
[01:01:50.563 --> 01:01:53.545]  I told you they wanted to blame us, and they're doing it.
[01:01:53.545 --> 01:01:56.727]  Because no one's got what it takes to challenge these people.
[01:01:56.727 --> 01:01:59.850]  We're all supposed to just lay down, and everybody's so afraid.
[01:02:00.998 --> 01:02:06.140]  You're so afraid of all this stuff that statistically isn't even that dangerous.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.761]  If the government kills me, that's just the way it is.
[01:02:09.761 --> 01:02:12.562]  I still drive in my car every day, even though that's the most dangerous thing I do.
[01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:15.743]  I risk my life every day, and I'm aware of it.
[01:02:15.743 --> 01:02:20.264]  And, you know, I know what GMO does, but I still let my kids eat it sometimes because I'm lazy.
[01:02:20.264 --> 01:02:22.465]  I know what cell phones do, but I'm lazy.
[01:02:22.465 --> 01:02:26.486]  I mean, a lot of it is that we're all killing ourselves to live, basically.
[01:02:27.398 --> 01:02:30.499]  And I'm not going to sit here and just let the worst of the worst run over everything.
[01:02:30.499 --> 01:02:32.220]  I'm done.
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:37.841]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in New York, and we'll go to Mario and Nick and Liz and Derek and everybody.
[01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:38.282]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:02:38.282 --> 01:02:40.862]  Thanks for holding.
[01:02:40.862 --> 01:02:41.363]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:41.363 --> 01:02:46.104]  Thank you for taking my call, and thank you very much for your efforts.
[01:02:46.104 --> 01:02:48.965]  I got a couple of points that I want to stress.
[01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:53.647]  Number one, people need to know that this Boston thing is to take our civil liberties.
[01:02:53.647 --> 01:02:54.547]  People need to know that
[01:02:55.769 --> 01:03:01.712]  I understand that the Second Amendment, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights needs to be defended.
[01:03:01.712 --> 01:03:23.902]  Another point is that some of the reporters out there that need to come out, more people like Rudowski, Badandi, yourself, need to come out and get on the Obama's face and Biden's black helicopter face and ask how do they feel when the VP called for a new world order one week before the bombing.
[01:03:25.746 --> 01:03:29.569]  Another thing is that I come from a third world country.
[01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:38.976]  I saw on your page that probably Obama might have a gun ban from importation.
[01:03:38.976 --> 01:03:48.023]  Oh you know he's saying that he's going to adopt the UN policy and do it and Biden has said they will and they had a pro-gun group on my YouTube saying I'm a liar.
[01:03:48.023 --> 01:03:51.765]  Even when it's official people can't even admit it's happening.
[01:03:51.765 --> 01:03:53.367]  Well let me tell the people this.
[01:03:53.367 --> 01:03:54.988]  I come from a country that has the same thing.
[01:03:55.714 --> 01:04:03.258]  You know, you cannot bring guns in, so the only thing that that leads to is for contraband.
[01:04:03.258 --> 01:04:11.023]  Number two, only crooks and the people in power are the only ones who are going to have guns.
[01:04:11.023 --> 01:04:14.365]  And whatever guns are going to be left, they're going to be very, very expensive.
[01:04:14.365 --> 01:04:16.786]  People cannot buy them.
[01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:17.827]  And that leads to more...
[01:04:23.533 --> 01:04:24.314]  Okay.
[01:04:24.314 --> 01:04:29.219]  The people running our society are criminals and they have a criminal instinct that they're scared.
[01:04:29.219 --> 01:04:35.046]  I mean, look, I mean, people in Texas aren't scared out in parking lots and even seedy looking people are scared of you.
[01:04:35.046 --> 01:04:36.928]  I'll be quite honest with you.
[01:04:36.928 --> 01:04:39.711]  In Texas, everybody's scared of people driving around in pickup trucks.
[01:04:41.546 --> 01:04:45.728]  Because they know, you know, white guys in pickup trucks are packing guns.
[01:04:45.728 --> 01:04:46.869]  And I've seen the statistics.
[01:04:46.869 --> 01:04:55.573]  Thieves, whether they be white, black, it doesn't matter, will tend to pick on, quote, immigrants who they know come from countries, this has been proven, who don't have gun culture.
[01:04:55.573 --> 01:05:01.276]  So, in fact, a lot of immigrant groups feed on their own immigrants because they know they're probably not carrying guns.
[01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:03.557]  Criminals hate the gun culture.
[01:05:03.557 --> 01:05:06.418]  They hate the fact that good people are armed and aren't going to roll over.
[01:05:08.419 --> 01:05:14.244]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:21.924]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[01:05:21.924 --> 01:05:32.869]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[01:05:32.869 --> 01:05:37.011]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:05:37.011 --> 01:05:43.195]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:05:43.935 --> 01:05:55.187]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:09.404]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:06:09.404 --> 01:06:11.565]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:06:11.565 --> 01:06:17.287]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:06:17.287 --> 01:06:21.328]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:06:21.328 --> 01:06:25.249]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:06:25.249 --> 01:06:26.650]  The fact is, you are.
[01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.670]  We all are.
[01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:30.011]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:06:30.311 --> 01:06:38.858]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[01:07:19.522 --> 01:07:32.767]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.

[01:07:40.471 --> 01:07:42.092]  The Science Digest Journal says,
[01:08:12.533 --> 01:08:13.834]  Big Brother.
[01:08:13.834 --> 01:08:15.596]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:15.596 --> 01:08:17.357]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:17.357 --> 01:08:18.958]  You want answers?
[01:08:18.958 --> 01:08:20.500]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.683]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:28.806]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.182]  Alright, we're going to be taking your phone calls throughout the hour.
[01:08:43.182 --> 01:08:46.184]  We've confirmed the Secret Service threatened our reporter.
[01:08:46.184 --> 01:08:52.589]  And we have video proof that that article is going up at InfoWars.com and told it not to ask questions in America.
[01:08:52.589 --> 01:08:54.651]  So the Secret Service doesn't just deal with counterfeiting.
[01:08:55.211 --> 01:08:55.591]  We're good to go.
[01:09:25.972 --> 01:09:30.336]  We have this all linked up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:30.336 --> 01:09:34.540]  Tamerlan recruited via Georgian Foundation
[01:09:35.672 --> 01:09:50.558]  Working to help in conjunction with the Georgian Special Services and Americans, and then they help fund the different radical Muslim groups, including the Bin Laden of Chechnya, who this guy reportedly admired, because they're using him to attack the Russians.
[01:09:50.558 --> 01:09:56.481]  And who is the father of this 1979 plan, strategy of tension and proxy state?
[01:09:56.481 --> 01:09:58.401]  Here it is, it's the Jamestown U.S.
[01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:00.982]  non-profit, the board of directors of NGOs,
[01:10:03.982 --> 01:10:06.003]  ...entered one of the ideologists of the U.S.
[01:10:06.003 --> 01:10:13.765]  foreign policy, Zbigniew Brzezinski, has engaged in recruiting residents of North Caucuses to work on the interests of the United States and Georgia.
[01:10:13.765 --> 01:10:18.826]  They mean the mega-banks that have captured us and are now using America in the exploitation phase.
[01:10:18.826 --> 01:10:21.667]  They'll know what that means at the CIA against the next country.
[01:10:22.689 --> 01:10:23.930]  Unbelievable.
[01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:39.095]  According to the reports of the Colonel Chief Directorate Counterintelligence Department Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgian, Gregory Chanterea, the Minister of Internal Affairs, and just goes through workshops with the military.
[01:10:39.095 --> 01:10:41.156]  I mean, this guy was a commando.
[01:10:42.534 --> 01:10:45.656]  And that's why they had to get him dead immediately, whatever he knew.
[01:10:45.656 --> 01:10:48.498]  And I said, oh, these guys are dead.
[01:10:48.498 --> 01:10:50.519]  Well, they shoot the boat full of holes.
[01:10:50.519 --> 01:10:52.100]  Looks like 15 machine guns.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.442]  You have bullets every inch.
[01:10:54.442 --> 01:10:57.104]  They come up and say, and I heard the live police scanners.
[01:10:57.104 --> 01:11:03.288]  They're like, oh, no, the media's got a feed right when they were getting ready to do the deed.
[01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:04.549]  So they say, OK, come out.
[01:11:05.714 --> 01:11:13.240]  He puts his hands up, climbs out, and minutes later, is unconscious with his throat being chopped open, and then barely living.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:18.745]  So they could say, you know, leave it open, we can kill him if we want, or maybe shut him up, or get him to confess, and then kill him.
[01:11:18.745 --> 01:11:25.971]  And for those that don't know, you never have someone in intensive care and critical condition, and then have them say, oh, a source, he admits to doing it all.
[01:11:27.469 --> 01:11:29.650]  Never going to get a fair trial, folks.
[01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:30.770]  Never going to get a fair trial.
[01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:32.450]  And again, am I saying there aren't Muslim extremists?
[01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:33.111]  There are.
[01:11:33.111 --> 01:11:50.175]  The globalists are putting them in charge of Libya, in charge of Syria, to commit massacres of Christians in both countries, and Muslim minority groups, Shiite and other subgroups that are even more rare, like the Alawites and the Zoho Astrons.
[01:11:50.175 --> 01:11:51.576]  We've got all this going on.
[01:11:52.799 --> 01:11:56.001]  See folks, you're an expert on baseball and football, or your own business.
[01:11:56.001 --> 01:11:57.321]  I'm an expert on history.
[01:11:57.321 --> 01:11:58.482]  And I'm just giving you the basics.
[01:11:58.482 --> 01:12:01.804]  I mean, for someone informed, it's like you have 20-20 vision.
[01:12:01.804 --> 01:12:15.511]  For people that don't know where the caucuses are, or don't know about foundations, or haven't read all of Brzezinski's books, who don't watch CFR meetings, who don't read Foreign Affairs... I mean, Foreign Affairs said last year, yeah, we're running Al-Qaeda, we need them!
[01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:17.672]  Al-Qaeda's doing a great job!
[01:12:17.672 --> 01:12:18.653]  These are good fighters!
[01:12:20.026 --> 01:12:30.594]  They wear black uniforms with the Al-Qaeda patch, and they go into people's houses and say, we're going to kill your whole family if you don't drive this suicide bomb into that police convoy up there.
[01:12:30.594 --> 01:12:31.635]  I mean, you don't even know.
[01:12:31.635 --> 01:12:34.457]  They may have this guy's wife and kids saying we're going to kill them.
[01:12:34.457 --> 01:12:35.097]  You don't know.
[01:12:35.097 --> 01:12:36.718]  I know this.
[01:12:36.718 --> 01:12:41.462]  The aunt, who's a tough-as-nails lawyer in Canada, is a listener.
[01:12:41.462 --> 01:12:42.183]  We confirmed that.
[01:12:42.183 --> 01:12:42.803]  I talked to her.
[01:12:42.803 --> 01:12:43.884]  She said, I'm ready to go public.
[01:12:45.273 --> 01:12:46.493]  I called her back and she's crying.
[01:12:46.493 --> 01:12:48.734]  She goes, they will crush me like a bug if they're listening.
[01:12:48.734 --> 01:12:50.034]  I can't talk.
[01:12:50.034 --> 01:12:51.015]  I love my family.
[01:12:51.015 --> 01:12:55.656]  I, oh, the America I thought, I thought the West was free.
[01:12:55.656 --> 01:12:56.596]  Oh, it's terrible.
[01:12:56.596 --> 01:12:57.657]  It's terrible.
[01:12:57.657 --> 01:12:59.677]  Obviously is my summation.
[01:12:59.677 --> 01:13:03.058]  They called up and said, listen, bitch, we're going to kill your kids.
[01:13:03.058 --> 01:13:05.159]  If you don't shut up, you got that straight.
[01:13:05.159 --> 01:13:07.720]  And by the way, she was on record saying they were threatening her.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.301]  And I'm sorry to use that word, but that's how they talk to you because I've gotten the phone calls.
[01:13:13.524 --> 01:13:22.832]  They love to call my wife up and tell her about what she was just talking about, to let her know, hey, yeah, okay, you heard that, now you know we're listening.
[01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:27.876]  I will cut your head off, but they'll say it in a lot more vicious, like it's like a movie.
[01:13:27.876 --> 01:13:31.159]  Do you understand me, you bleeping you-know-what?
[01:13:31.159 --> 01:13:33.721]  But you know I'll do a lot more before I do that.
[01:13:33.721 --> 01:13:37.644]  See, you don't know who runs America.
[01:13:37.644 --> 01:13:42.348]  And so I'm up here just going, alright, oh well, I know who you are, I know what you've done.
[01:13:43.479 --> 01:13:48.760]  You think they hate Iraqis and killed over a million of them with starvation and all the rest of it and sanctions?
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.040]  And then they hate our troops even more.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.441]  They shoot them up with deadly shots.
[01:13:51.441 --> 01:13:52.161]  They brainwash them.
[01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.341]  They put them on deadly drugs.
[01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:54.541]  Now they're going to take their guns.
[01:13:54.541 --> 01:13:57.982]  They hate our troops a hundred times more.
[01:13:57.982 --> 01:13:59.462]  You're just nothing but a drone.
[01:13:59.462 --> 01:14:01.042]  You're nothing but a biological android.
[01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:02.283]  You're nothing but a clone.
[01:14:02.283 --> 01:14:03.623]  Cloned by this culture.
[01:14:03.623 --> 01:14:06.363]  They call us biological androids.
[01:14:06.363 --> 01:14:08.204]  Ray Kurzweil and all of them.
[01:14:08.204 --> 01:14:09.184]  It's a big new Brzezinski.
[01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:16.854]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling and believes all this and really thinks you're a hero!
[01:14:16.854 --> 01:14:17.515]  G.I.
[01:14:17.515 --> 01:14:19.816]  Joe, Great American Hero!
[01:14:19.816 --> 01:14:20.996]  Yo, Joe!
[01:14:20.996 --> 01:14:22.537]  You don't work for Joe!
[01:14:22.537 --> 01:14:25.258]  Joe got taken over!
[01:14:25.258 --> 01:14:25.799]  The G.I.
[01:14:25.799 --> 01:14:29.160]  Joe command base is run by Cobra!
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.401]  Do you understand that?
[01:14:30.401 --> 01:14:35.603]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you because that's your main programming template in North America.
[01:14:35.603 --> 01:14:36.964]  They're on record with that!
[01:14:36.964 --> 01:14:38.445]  That was all Pentagon directed!
[01:14:39.022 --> 01:14:40.864]  You understand you work for Cobra!
[01:14:40.864 --> 01:14:42.345]  You dress like Cobra!
[01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:44.006]  You have the tactics of Cobra!
[01:14:44.006 --> 01:14:45.407]  You are Cobra!
[01:14:45.407 --> 01:14:48.590]  Hail Cobra!
[01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:50.332]  You wanna be little boys?
[01:14:50.332 --> 01:14:53.795]  Or do you wanna really join the Republic?
[01:14:53.795 --> 01:14:55.236]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[01:14:55.236 --> 01:14:58.098]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[01:14:58.098 --> 01:15:00.680]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.302]  It's run by Chaos!
[01:15:02.302 --> 01:15:03.443]  It's run by Spectre!
[01:15:05.509 --> 01:15:15.032]  How do you think MI6, that Ian Fleming wrote about, he worked for him, he was in OSS, where the robber barons are going to release a bio-weapon to kill everybody.
[01:15:15.032 --> 01:15:17.273]  He wrote Moonraker in the 50s.
[01:15:17.273 --> 01:15:21.554]  That's the plan!
[01:15:21.554 --> 01:15:23.415]  Oblivion is the plan!
[01:15:23.415 --> 01:15:25.195]  Zardoz is the plan!
[01:15:25.195 --> 01:15:26.616]  It's the only plan!
[01:15:28.226 --> 01:15:31.490]  And you better pray to God they don't get this through!
[01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:38.360]  Because if Cobra, the Snake, the Devil, the Black Pyramid gets control, it's all over for you!
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.624]  So that's why does it matter if they kill me?
[01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:42.265]  Does it matter?
[01:15:42.265 --> 01:15:44.288]  Because my family has no future if we don't beat them.
[01:15:45.057 --> 01:15:49.218]  Sure what, I'm gonna live another 5-10 years, play ball with this, maybe 20?
[01:15:49.218 --> 01:15:57.179]  Play ball, you know, think I'm part of the elite, live in some high-rise all guarded, when the bioweapon gets released, we'll all be dying up in that high-rise.
[01:15:57.179 --> 01:16:00.120]  I'll be on the phone going, I thought I was part of the team!
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:05.181]  You know, these idiot operatives trying to discredit us online go, Alex Jones admits he's that family in the government.
[01:16:05.181 --> 01:16:06.901]  The proof, it's secret!
[01:16:06.901 --> 01:16:08.902]  I'm the one saying it on air!
[01:16:08.902 --> 01:16:10.442]  I'm the one telling you idiots!
[01:16:13.427 --> 01:16:17.069]  And I'm not going to say more because I don't want to get people in my family in trouble.
[01:16:17.069 --> 01:16:23.433]  The point is, the New World Order's real, you fools!
[01:16:23.433 --> 01:16:24.493]  They run little kids.
[01:16:24.493 --> 01:16:25.734]  They run the snuff films.
[01:16:25.734 --> 01:16:26.534]  They run the drugs.
[01:16:26.534 --> 01:16:27.255]  They run it all.
[01:16:27.255 --> 01:16:32.758]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's going to come down on us!
[01:16:32.758 --> 01:16:38.881]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[01:16:38.881 --> 01:16:40.202]  You work for Kaos.
[01:16:40.202 --> 01:16:41.203]  You work for Cobra.
[01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:43.037]  How do they get power?
[01:16:43.037 --> 01:16:47.879]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra.
[01:16:47.879 --> 01:16:48.660]  Who is Cobra?
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.461]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[01:16:52.461 --> 01:16:57.003]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[01:16:57.003 --> 01:16:59.844]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[01:16:59.844 --> 01:17:01.405]  Cobra runs the Muslims.
[01:17:01.405 --> 01:17:03.226]  Cobra runs the CIA.
[01:17:03.226 --> 01:17:04.626]  Cobra runs it all.
[01:17:04.626 --> 01:17:05.607]  Cobra is real!
[01:17:07.068 --> 01:17:09.209]  Haven't you people figured any of this out yet?
[01:17:09.209 --> 01:17:10.429]  The media will have a heyday with that.
[01:17:10.429 --> 01:17:13.210]  You can call it whatever you want.
[01:17:13.210 --> 01:17:15.350]  Cobra is in control of America.
[01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:27.694]  And Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners and the conservatives and the people that say there's a foreign New World Order banking takeover happening, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[01:17:27.694 --> 01:17:29.314]  That's what Cobra would say.
[01:17:29.314 --> 01:17:31.055]  That's what Specter would say.
[01:17:31.055 --> 01:17:32.835]  That's what Goldfinger would say.
[01:17:32.835 --> 01:17:34.836]  Because that's who those people are.
[01:17:40.174 --> 01:17:46.456]  James Bond works for Spectre.
[01:17:46.456 --> 01:17:52.358]  James Bond is Spectre, is Cobra.
[01:17:52.358 --> 01:17:54.179]  They are the bad guys.
[01:17:54.179 --> 01:18:00.281]  And the local cop doesn't know that because you are just like the man in Oblivion.
[01:18:00.281 --> 01:18:02.702]  Go see it, and then you'll understand it.
[01:18:02.702 --> 01:18:05.043]  It's an allegory of what you are.
[01:18:06.135 --> 01:18:08.959]  It's an allegory of a program.
[01:18:08.959 --> 01:18:12.524]  They see you as a flesh and blood robot.
[01:18:12.524 --> 01:18:16.109]  They think you're a dumb animal that cannot get above the program.
[01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:19.591]  And the issue is you obviously can't be told this, can you?
[01:18:19.591 --> 01:18:21.993]  Your kid's gonna have to get diagnosed with cancer.
[01:18:21.993 --> 01:18:25.034]  You're gonna have to get diagnosed with neurological disorders early.
[01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:31.498]  You're going to have to see things in your business, in your life, that are so evil that you finally make a break with it.
[01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:36.501]  You decide... I was talking to one of my uncles who saw a lot of stuff, I'll leave it at that.
[01:18:36.501 --> 01:18:40.143]  And he said, there will come a point in these people's lives, these operators' lives,
[01:18:41.257 --> 01:18:52.542]  And these corporate people, and the rest of them, where you've gone along and accepted so much evil, and finally something so bad, you decide to jump into it and go with it, or you'd repent and get completely out of it.
[01:18:52.542 --> 01:18:54.303]  That's the only way.
[01:18:54.303 --> 01:18:58.925]  You gotta have a clean break with all this stuff.
[01:18:58.925 --> 01:19:01.086]  That's the only way, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:01.086 --> 01:19:04.428]  This thing is taking us to oblivion.
[01:19:04.428 --> 01:19:07.069]  There is no getting out of this if they win.
[01:19:07.069 --> 01:19:08.770]  There is no good ending.
[01:19:10.799 --> 01:19:14.306]  You people that think you're true believers in this, you are not true believers.
[01:19:14.306 --> 01:19:17.572]  You're not saving the earth with your earth cult crap.
[01:19:17.572 --> 01:19:19.757]  That's another fake story you've been given.
[01:19:23.168 --> 01:19:24.789]  This is not the island!
[01:19:24.789 --> 01:19:26.690]  It's a projection, okay?
[01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:29.492]  This is not... Folks, it's THX 1138.
[01:19:29.492 --> 01:19:30.713]  It's the island.
[01:19:30.713 --> 01:19:32.174]  It's oblivion.
[01:19:32.174 --> 01:19:34.135]  You are in a controlled paradigm.
[01:19:34.135 --> 01:19:35.316]  You've got to come out of it.
[01:19:35.316 --> 01:19:36.797]  It is the matrix.
[01:19:36.797 --> 01:19:38.618]  But it isn't a physical matrix yet.
[01:19:38.618 --> 01:19:40.660]  They're trying to insert us into that.
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:42.621]  That's a 1970s Pentagon plan.
[01:19:42.621 --> 01:19:46.183]  Look it up.
[01:19:46.183 --> 01:19:49.466]  They have this whole thing planned out.
[01:19:49.466 --> 01:19:50.987]  And it is crazy!
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:53.763]  You are living in 2013, all right?
[01:19:53.763 --> 01:19:54.704]  I promise.
[01:19:54.704 --> 01:19:56.427]  I'm going to Mario.
[01:19:56.427 --> 01:19:57.729]  I'm going to Liz.
[01:19:57.729 --> 01:19:59.151]  I'm going to Derek.
[01:19:59.151 --> 01:19:59.832]  I'm going to Nick.
[01:19:59.832 --> 01:20:00.533]  I'm going to Jenny.
[01:20:00.533 --> 01:20:02.256]  I'm going to all of you.
[01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:06.442]  But it's now come out that these guys were CIA.
[01:20:06.442 --> 01:20:07.063]  They were CIA.
[01:20:08.072 --> 01:20:13.296]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:21:08.208 --> 01:21:12.273]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:21:12.273 --> 01:21:18.161]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:21:18.161 --> 01:21:19.282]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:21:19.282 --> 01:21:23.267]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:21:23.968 --> 01:21:37.774]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:21:37.774 --> 01:21:43.377]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:21:43.377 --> 01:21:49.200]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:21:53.423 --> 01:21:55.466]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:21:55.466 --> 01:21:55.526]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:07.483 --> 01:22:11.925]  Nothing is more American than Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:22:11.925 --> 01:22:14.686]  100% American made since 1987.

[01:24:33.325 --> 01:24:41.472]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:24:41.472 --> 01:24:47.237]  If the government can shut down a whole city and point guns at people and take you out of your houses and then rationalize it, they can do anything.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:55.081]  Like take your bank accounts, like make you take vaccines, like conscript your children for domestic homeland operations.
[01:24:55.081 --> 01:25:07.824]  And of course, there'll be no economy left, so you'll want that job, and you'll want the authority, the rockstarism that Edward Bernays talked about, of being in the government now, a rockstar, with a bunch of narcissists strutting around.
[01:25:07.824 --> 01:25:08.984]  That's like North Korea.
[01:25:08.984 --> 01:25:14.165]  We are becoming, slowly but surely, like North Korea, run by a bunch of inbred psychopaths laughing at us.
[01:25:14.745 --> 01:25:15.866]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:25:15.866 --> 01:25:20.610]  Huge breaking news coming up at InfoWars.com with the Secret Service and more.
[01:25:20.610 --> 01:25:21.671]  Just stay with us.
[01:25:21.671 --> 01:25:24.173]  Mario in South Carolina, thanks for holding.
[01:25:24.173 --> 01:25:26.294]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:25:26.294 --> 01:25:27.395]  Yes, Alex Jones.
[01:25:27.395 --> 01:25:30.818]  I wanted to call about an upcoming FEMA drill.
[01:25:31.383 --> 01:25:49.502]  That I saw on the internet, on April 27th, if you go to Google, type in Nevada Governor 2014 Zombie UFO Drill, and that'll come up and you'll be able to... No, I know, and it was so shocking, they then said it was a lie when it came out, but do you know why they do a zombie drill now?
[01:25:53.209 --> 01:26:01.496]  The guy was talking about how Cold War in government for zombie is the one that is on welfare during a financial crisis.
[01:26:01.496 --> 01:26:02.337]  That's right.
[01:26:02.337 --> 01:26:09.703]  Look, the Marines did all these drills of mowing minorities down in some of the videos we have in Police 2000.
[01:26:09.703 --> 01:26:16.089]  They either trained to kill black people mainly, and you can look at the role players they got, or they trained to kill rednecks and John Deere hats.
[01:26:16.089 --> 01:26:17.370]  That's who they're going to have trouble with.
[01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:23.872]  Uh, and, uh, for whatever reason, mainly it's John Deere hats, but about a quarter of it is trying to kill black people.
[01:26:23.872 --> 01:26:25.073]  Uh, line them up and shoot them.
[01:26:25.073 --> 01:26:26.493]  I didn't really see a lot of Hispanics.
[01:26:26.493 --> 01:26:34.316]  I saw some, but, uh, you know, the point is, it was just mainly, I've been to so many of these drills, it's either, okay, we're trying to kill black people, or we're trying to kill rednecks.
[01:26:34.316 --> 01:26:35.557]  Uh, but yeah, that's it.
[01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:36.517]  Very astute.
[01:26:36.517 --> 01:26:38.038]  And so now they just call it a zombie.
[01:26:38.858 --> 01:26:42.319]  Because you're already seen as an animal, so it's part of dehumanization.
[01:26:42.319 --> 01:26:48.661]  See, the Nazis said for, you know, seven, eight years, our enemies are rats and bugs in all these newsreels.
[01:26:48.661 --> 01:26:50.362]  Now the LA Times has said that about me.
[01:26:50.362 --> 01:26:51.382]  To dehumanize.
[01:26:51.382 --> 01:26:52.983]  Now they just say you're a zombie.
[01:26:52.983 --> 01:26:59.145]  And all the zombie shows that are on record are meant to condition you and acclimate you to not care about death and destruction.
[01:26:59.145 --> 01:27:03.046]  To build a core of psychopaths that will carry out the extermination operations.
[01:27:03.046 --> 01:27:03.286]  Go ahead.
[01:27:04.249 --> 01:27:07.371]  Well, I was just going to say that, uh, this was listed.
[01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:09.012]  It said 100 participants.
[01:27:09.012 --> 01:27:12.234]  So I was thinking maybe it was an upcoming false flag.
[01:27:12.234 --> 01:27:14.015]  Because, you know, they have to do a drill.
[01:27:14.015 --> 01:27:15.956]  Because if they get caught, they can blame the judge.
[01:27:15.956 --> 01:27:17.897]  Oh, yeah, and then they'll just say there wasn't even a drill.
[01:27:17.897 --> 01:27:19.959]  They won't even imagine that it's in the newspaper.
[01:27:19.959 --> 01:27:21.139]  They'll just say there was no drill.
[01:27:21.139 --> 01:27:22.480]  And we'll go, well, his video was zombies.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.061]  And they'll go, those didn't exist either.
[01:27:24.061 --> 01:27:25.542]  So look, Jones says they're zombies.
[01:27:27.518 --> 01:27:32.003]  And he says Cobra Commander runs things, which is an allegory, but basically it's the same thing.
[01:27:32.003 --> 01:27:37.008]  The world is ruled, to a great extent, by people that make Cobra Commander look like an angel.
[01:27:37.008 --> 01:27:38.810]  But it's the exact tactics you see.
[01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:43.656]  They were teaching little kids the type of dirty tricks they were going to carry out as globalist operatives.
[01:27:44.977 --> 01:27:46.198]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:27:46.198 --> 01:27:58.747]  Also, another thing, a few years ago during that whole Georgian thing with Russia, I was actually there and it was pretty weird because the Russians were following behind us and I knew that
[01:28:00.126 --> 01:28:03.709]  Who actually did the first attack, but everyone else, you know, they didn't know.
[01:28:21.943 --> 01:28:25.444]  Because the Russians don't really ever attack anybody until they get messed with.
[01:28:25.444 --> 01:28:26.665]  Or they infiltrate to take over.
[01:28:26.665 --> 01:28:27.285]  I'm like, yeah.
[01:28:27.285 --> 01:28:31.087]  So I get up and CNN's like, the Russians have attacked, the dastardly.
[01:28:31.087 --> 01:28:32.767]  You know, there could be nuclear war.
[01:28:32.767 --> 01:28:36.109]  So I drive in, I go on air at 11 a.m.
[01:28:36.109 --> 01:28:38.950]  and I say, well the Russians attacked.
[01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:42.671]  Not knowing, even naive, you know, back in 2008 how big of liars they are.
[01:28:42.671 --> 01:28:45.172]  And yes, it later came out the U.S.
[01:28:45.172 --> 01:28:48.774]  through proxies attacked Russia-held areas in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[01:28:48.774 --> 01:28:49.954]  You say you were there in the Navy.
[01:28:49.954 --> 01:28:50.555]  Tell us about that.
[01:28:50.555 --> 01:28:51.255]  I see that on screen.
[01:28:52.389 --> 01:28:54.290]  Yeah, so I was there in the Navy.
[01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:58.952]  I'm not going to really name the ship, but there's only one ship in the meds over there.
[01:28:58.952 --> 01:29:07.176]  But basically, we responded for a humanitarian call, and we basically gave the Georgians some supplies.
[01:29:07.176 --> 01:29:13.299]  But at the same time, I was talking to a friend that I met, a girl, you know, being in the Navy and everything.
[01:29:13.299 --> 01:29:17.621]  And she was in Russia, and she was explaining to me the entire situation.
[01:29:18.361 --> 01:29:21.082]  And I was like, wow, you know, that doesn't really make too much sense.
[01:29:21.082 --> 01:29:27.103]  You know, why are we helping out the Georgians when, you know... Now on the ship, did they tell you that Russia had attacked?
[01:29:27.103 --> 01:29:30.624]  Or were they more honest, knowing you'd have the information?
[01:29:30.624 --> 01:29:31.824]  They didn't tell us.
[01:29:31.824 --> 01:29:33.845]  You know, that was more high level.
[01:29:33.845 --> 01:29:40.266]  But all they told us was to be on watch, you know, sending information throughout the med and everything.
[01:29:40.266 --> 01:29:44.347]  Because I was, you know, dealing with communications while on the ship.
[01:29:44.347 --> 01:29:46.548]  So they were... Anything else you want to add on that, sir?
[01:29:47.888 --> 01:29:49.689]  Uh, on that, no.
[01:29:49.689 --> 01:29:51.889]  You know, I just wanted to let everyone know that.
[01:29:51.889 --> 01:29:52.570]  Well, God bless you.
[01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:57.211]  Yeah, thanks for bringing up another zombie drill, which is another drill for mass extermination of citizens.
[01:29:57.211 --> 01:29:58.612]  We're on the march.
[01:29:58.612 --> 01:30:01.133]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:31:11.547 --> 01:31:16.550]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:23.694]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:31:23.874 --> 01:31:29.498]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:33:28.405 --> 01:33:29.386]  Thomas Jefferson
[01:33:57.830 --> 01:34:00.352]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:34:00.352 --> 01:34:02.874]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:34:02.874 --> 01:34:18.645]  The top story up on InfoWars.com is that the CIA had recruited in Georgia four operations, the older Tamerlan brothers.
[01:34:18.645 --> 01:34:20.567]  So that story is red-linked.
[01:34:21.946 --> 01:34:27.914]  Up at Infowars.com, we know he had an alias to get in and out of the country, which the government let him use.
[01:34:27.914 --> 01:34:29.616]  That's the big tip-off.
[01:34:29.616 --> 01:34:32.820]  We know this has the classic signs there.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:40.323]  Again, that is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:34:40.323 --> 01:34:44.586]  You add to this that we have the senator coming out, Chambliss.
[01:34:44.586 --> 01:34:46.487]  We're going to play that clip here in just a moment.
[01:34:46.487 --> 01:34:51.210]  Law enforcement agency may have had info about Boston bombing in advance.
[01:34:51.210 --> 01:34:52.751]  You add the drill did go on.
[01:34:52.751 --> 01:34:54.893]  And then you add the Secret Service.
[01:34:56.854 --> 01:35:07.862]  The Secret Service did not want Dan Bodondi to ask questions and Dan talked about this and it turns out there was video aired from some of the angles on national television.
[01:35:09.085 --> 01:35:09.545]  and those
[01:35:39.625 --> 01:35:46.910]  To get this any positive coverage, it was Michael Savage, Paul Watson heard it and told me about it, I didn't hear it, and said of course you want to ask about the drill.
[01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:53.293]  And now we found new articles in the Boston Globe admitting a drill, but they tried to spin it and a drill a few years before that.
[01:35:53.293 --> 01:35:56.615]  So there was a drill of a bombing right where it happens.
[01:35:56.615 --> 01:35:57.256]  Why do you do that?
[01:35:57.256 --> 01:35:59.097]  You want to have black backpacks everywhere.
[01:36:00.846 --> 01:36:03.589]  And again, the people with the black backpacks, they're not involved.
[01:36:03.589 --> 01:36:05.811]  They're part of the drill with their black backpacks.
[01:36:05.811 --> 01:36:09.434]  Contractors, National Guard, Navy SEALs, you name it.
[01:36:09.434 --> 01:36:12.777]  And then that way, no one can catch the real bomb when it gets left.
[01:36:12.777 --> 01:36:15.620]  And there's so many people with backpacks, it gets confusing.
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:24.048]  And then you can blame the patsies, which are your intelligence ops, or who are your assets, who believe they're taking part in a drill.
[01:36:25.253 --> 01:36:29.094]  Then the mother says, they call him up, threaten him to make him go on the run.
[01:36:29.094 --> 01:36:37.095]  They were both hanging out, going to parties night before, talking about how weird the bombing was, and then magically they supposedly run.
[01:36:37.095 --> 01:36:38.835]  We don't know if any of that's true.
[01:36:38.835 --> 01:36:44.256]  Then he climbs out of the boat, not bleeding from the neck, next he's almost dead with his neck being cut open.
[01:36:44.256 --> 01:36:47.857]  And now, they have shown he'll never get a free trial.
[01:36:47.857 --> 01:36:52.098]  The younger brother, they're in the news saying, oh, Boston Globe, witnesses,
[01:36:53.683 --> 01:36:59.472]  No, sources say he admitted to the bombings.
[01:36:59.472 --> 01:37:02.216]  Admits to setting bombs with brother, sources say.
[01:37:02.216 --> 01:37:06.683]  Also admits he and brother Tamerlan were behind killing of MIT officer.
[01:37:07.782 --> 01:37:08.503]  So there you go.
[01:37:08.503 --> 01:37:10.564]  It's all open and shut, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:10.564 --> 01:37:11.825]  And it's a conspiracy there.
[01:37:11.825 --> 01:37:14.147]  Yeah, he was at CIA workshops.
[01:37:14.147 --> 01:37:16.228]  Yeah, he had covers.
[01:37:16.228 --> 01:37:17.910]  Yeah, there was a drill.
[01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:21.532]  Yeah, the senator says it looks like it was prior knowledge and they stood down.
[01:37:21.532 --> 01:37:24.034]  Yeah, everything Alex Jones predicted.
[01:37:24.034 --> 01:37:25.796]  And folks, why did I predict it?
[01:37:25.796 --> 01:37:27.697]  Let's punch up InfoWars.com.
[01:37:27.697 --> 01:37:28.698]  This is from April 19th.
[01:37:31.303 --> 01:37:32.124]  I said Saturday.
[01:37:32.124 --> 01:37:35.065]  It was actually Friday night.
[01:37:35.065 --> 01:37:36.326]  I saw this Saturday morning.
[01:37:36.326 --> 01:37:40.028]  Boston Bomber's role of CIA in Chechnya terror.
[01:37:40.028 --> 01:37:44.431]  And he goes through and lists the very State Department groups in Georgetown.
[01:37:44.431 --> 01:37:47.373]  And the very, very groups connected in Zabrigny and Brzezinski.
[01:37:47.373 --> 01:37:52.996]  And how they have funded these groups and how they had an alias.
[01:37:52.996 --> 01:37:54.057]  And all of that later came out.
[01:37:54.057 --> 01:37:56.779]  You know, the mother said they were all over him five years before.
[01:37:58.533 --> 01:38:01.594]  And the mothers said they visited him two and a half years ago, which was confirmed.
[01:38:01.594 --> 01:38:05.695]  Mothers were telling the truth because the Russians blew their cover.
[01:38:05.695 --> 01:38:07.436]  That's how the Russians would do it.
[01:38:07.436 --> 01:38:07.996]  Or the U.S.
[01:38:07.996 --> 01:38:08.376]  would do it.
[01:38:08.376 --> 01:38:11.457]  Hey, who is this you're having with an alias go back and forth?
[01:38:11.457 --> 01:38:12.117]  He worked for you.
[01:38:12.117 --> 01:38:17.079]  Is he a terrorist?
[01:38:17.079 --> 01:38:20.300]  And by the way, it's seasoned people who've run black ops like
[01:38:22.887 --> 01:38:24.808]  Steve Pachenek saying it's an inside job.
[01:38:24.808 --> 01:38:29.091]  It's seasoned people, like Joel Skousen concurring with my analysis, okay?
[01:38:29.091 --> 01:38:31.532]  You think it's fun to go up against these people?
[01:38:31.532 --> 01:38:38.256]  I mean, even if you don't believe it's an inside job, there's no history of that, and you want to say, USA, take my rights, and you're a fool.
[01:38:38.256 --> 01:38:38.917]  Even if you're a fool!
[01:38:40.182 --> 01:38:43.063]  Do you know the government goes after people that stand up to them?
[01:38:43.063 --> 01:38:44.523]  Because they're bullies.
[01:38:44.523 --> 01:38:46.963]  So you think I enjoy doing this?
[01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:48.064]  They call me a maniac.
[01:38:48.064 --> 01:38:49.364]  They call me a madman.
[01:38:49.364 --> 01:38:50.524]  They call me spooky.
[01:38:50.524 --> 01:38:51.804]  They call me dangerous.
[01:38:51.804 --> 01:38:52.965]  They call me a fascist.
[01:38:52.965 --> 01:38:55.485]  Folks, I'm really just a Texan.
[01:38:55.485 --> 01:38:58.746]  And I'll be honest with you, your ancestors were tough and they stood up.
[01:38:58.746 --> 01:39:02.146]  I'll guarantee if you research them, my ancestors were just as tough or tougher.
[01:39:02.146 --> 01:39:03.987]  And they didn't bow to King George.
[01:39:03.987 --> 01:39:05.087]  They didn't bow to Santa Ana.
[01:39:06.670 --> 01:39:07.070]  And you know what?
[01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:09.431]  A lot of them didn't survive, but the idea went on.
[01:39:09.431 --> 01:39:10.491]  And that's just in my blood.
[01:39:10.491 --> 01:39:11.912]  I am not a slave.
[01:39:11.912 --> 01:39:26.437]  And I'm not going to be ruled by a bunch of murdering criminals that have put Libya and Syria under Al-Qaeda to line Christians up and chop their heads off, while telling me I got to give my rights up or Al-Qaeda will get me when they run them.
[01:39:26.437 --> 01:39:28.918]  And by the way, they're going to take everything, folks.
[01:39:28.918 --> 01:39:30.458]  This is a really nasty group.
[01:39:30.458 --> 01:39:31.138]  Now, I'm going to shut up.
[01:39:31.138 --> 01:39:32.659]  I'm going to have them on for about five minutes.
[01:39:32.659 --> 01:39:34.400]  Then we're going to go to your phone calls.
[01:39:36.909 --> 01:39:42.431]  And Nick and Jordan and Derek and Jenny, we're going to get to all of you here in just a moment.
[01:39:42.431 --> 01:39:44.371]  But history's happening here.
[01:39:44.371 --> 01:39:47.892]  We're the only ones at InfoWars.com on the trail.
[01:39:47.892 --> 01:39:57.595]  I have put my name, my family, most importantly, my treasure, everything on this because I know what I'm talking about.
[01:39:57.595 --> 01:40:00.016]  I mean, it isn't hard when the globalists have done this over and over again.
[01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:09.124]  It's like, you know, I hate to use a gross analogy, it's like walking through a field with cows in it, and there's a big steaming pile of cow manure right there.
[01:40:09.124 --> 01:40:11.024]  And I go, hey, watch out, that's cow manure.
[01:40:11.024 --> 01:40:12.325]  And some city slicker goes, really?
[01:40:12.325 --> 01:40:15.766]  I think it's a big chocolate cake.
[01:40:15.766 --> 01:40:17.427]  And I'm like, no, that's cow manure, I promise.
[01:40:17.427 --> 01:40:20.548]  Cows, you eat grass, they got three stomachs, they crap that out.
[01:40:20.548 --> 01:40:21.788]  They're like, shut up, conspiracy theorists.
[01:40:21.788 --> 01:40:23.969]  And they sit down with a spoon and start eating it.
[01:40:23.969 --> 01:40:25.549]  And you're like, hey, does that really taste good?
[01:40:25.549 --> 01:40:27.470]  They're like, yeah, it's chocolate, like I said.
[01:40:28.837 --> 01:40:30.598]  And you're going, no, no, man, this is tyranny.
[01:40:30.598 --> 01:40:31.859]  You don't want to eat that.
[01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:32.879]  You don't want to go down this road.
[01:40:32.879 --> 01:40:34.300]  The founders said it was cow manure.
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.721]  They're like, no, I say it's chocolate cake.
[01:40:36.721 --> 01:40:39.003]  And that's what Americans are doing that go along with this.
[01:40:39.003 --> 01:40:43.325]  I say everybody having to put their hands up and come out of their houses is chocolate cake.
[01:40:43.325 --> 01:40:46.207]  I'm saying the government spying on us without warrants is chocolate cake.
[01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:48.868]  I'm saying drones targeting us domestically is a good thing.
[01:40:48.868 --> 01:40:49.649]  It's chocolate cake.
[01:40:50.691 --> 01:40:55.553]  Let me tell you why a lot of people kind of halfway sell out to all this, like you've been seeing lately.
[01:40:55.553 --> 01:40:56.394]  God love them.
[01:40:56.394 --> 01:41:00.976]  It's because they're scared, ladies and gentlemen, and their wives sit home saying, man, this is dangerous.
[01:41:00.976 --> 01:41:06.798]  And all the ladies from the Senate are saying, we better watch it and play ball, honey, and work on the inside and fix things that way.
[01:41:06.798 --> 01:41:10.000]  I mean, I don't like that phone call I got.
[01:41:16.923 --> 01:41:21.586]  Let me tell you, you better look in your kid's eyes long and hard, because I'll tell you one thing that's for certain.
[01:41:21.586 --> 01:41:26.528]  You go along with this, you can kiss their butts goodbye.
[01:41:26.528 --> 01:41:33.672]  You got all these senators and media people in their fancy suits up there on egomaniac trips.
[01:41:33.672 --> 01:41:43.778]  And if you're not dedicated to this for liberty and for freedom and justice and tuning in to being a good person and the universe, then you are going to end up kneeling to this evil.
[01:41:45.063 --> 01:41:47.226]  You're going to end up compromising with it.
[01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:50.211]  You're going to end up selling out to it.
[01:41:50.211 --> 01:41:53.016]  And you can't sell out to death, folks.
[01:41:53.016 --> 01:41:54.899]  There's no compromising with the New World Order.
[01:41:56.397 --> 01:42:01.963]  I want to bring you now Dan Bodondi, InfoWars reporter, someone people admire for his courage.
[01:42:01.963 --> 01:42:03.465]  People ask, why did I hire Dan Bodondi?
[01:42:03.465 --> 01:42:08.010]  Because, you know, I mean, if you go back to the way I was first on air 18 years ago, I'd stutter and stammer sometimes.
[01:42:08.010 --> 01:42:09.011]  I still do it.
[01:42:09.011 --> 01:42:10.333]  I would get overly excited.
[01:42:10.333 --> 01:42:15.719]  I would, you know, you know, does he look like one of the anchors on Fox News?
[01:42:15.719 --> 01:42:16.600]  No, he doesn't.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.080]  Do I?
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:17.481]  No, I don't.
[01:42:18.595 --> 01:42:23.296]  But he's a real guy and has a fighting spirit, and that's why he's a reporter for Infowars.com.
[01:42:23.296 --> 01:42:25.617]  And he did something that none of those other cowards would do.
[01:42:25.617 --> 01:42:26.897]  They won't even look at photos.
[01:42:26.897 --> 01:42:30.358]  Dan's like, I have photos of the other people that they don't want you to see.
[01:42:30.358 --> 01:42:34.119]  The Secret Service comes over, let's show the images, and gets in his face and threatens him.
[01:42:34.119 --> 01:42:37.700]  And now, they wouldn't say who they were last week.
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:38.400]  He thought they were FBI.
[01:42:39.807 --> 01:42:44.508]  Now, people pointed out, notice this is Secret Service on record with Obama.
[01:42:44.508 --> 01:42:51.029]  So Obama sent guys to bug their eyes out and threaten Dan Bodondi, and there he is standing up to him.
[01:42:51.029 --> 01:42:51.549]  Look at him.
[01:42:51.549 --> 01:42:53.389]  That's what the globals are doing to all of America.
[01:42:53.389 --> 01:43:02.491]  They're coming up, getting in your face, staring at you, trying to look evil, trying to look tough, so that you'll bend over, so foreign banks can implode the country and take over.
[01:43:02.491 --> 01:43:04.011]  All because they feel like they belong.
[01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:08.552]  Why don't you, Secret Service, be like the Secret Service agent Bongino?
[01:43:09.471 --> 01:43:18.597]  It was sitting there at a meeting and he thought it was like a Mao Zedong meeting as Obama was talking about how collectivism is good and how you didn't build that and how children must tell their parents what to do.
[01:43:18.597 --> 01:43:25.202]  He recognized he was in a globalist, collectivist, hardcore authoritarian meeting.
[01:43:25.202 --> 01:43:27.823]  And I guess Don Salazar now has his article up.
[01:43:27.823 --> 01:43:28.924]  Great job to Don.
[01:43:28.924 --> 01:43:29.725]  I just said blurb it.
[01:43:29.725 --> 01:43:32.607]  He did a whole article with the photos now up at Infowars.com.
[01:43:32.607 --> 01:43:33.687]  We need to red-link that as well.
[01:43:37.059 --> 01:43:44.201]  You know, I've had Secret Service come up to me, I'm not saying they're all bad, I know a lot of my listeners have run into them since, but the guys they send are the ones that are evil.
[01:43:44.201 --> 01:43:47.362]  The ones that'll do what they're told, the ones that get off of being a bully and trying to scare people.
[01:43:47.362 --> 01:43:49.962]  I'd be embarrassed trying to scare somebody who wasn't asking for it.
[01:43:49.962 --> 01:43:54.364]  And then I wouldn't try to scare them, I'd try to climb all over, you know, who was trying to hurt an innocent person.
[01:43:54.364 --> 01:43:57.364]  Try to get, you know, get them off of what was happening.
[01:43:57.364 --> 01:44:03.306]  I had Secret Service try stuff like this with me, when I tried to just go down and report on the 2000 election results.
[01:44:04.622 --> 01:44:06.866]  They think this is Communist China.
[01:44:06.866 --> 01:44:07.968]  They think it's North Korea.
[01:44:07.968 --> 01:44:08.669]  And you know what?
[01:44:08.669 --> 01:44:10.613]  If we let them act like that, it is.
[01:44:10.613 --> 01:44:13.638]  Dan Bodondi, a hero to many out there, Infowars.com reporter.
[01:44:15.181 --> 01:44:17.423]  Great job, my friend.
[01:44:17.423 --> 01:44:20.124]  He's even got family, because he's right there by Boston.
[01:44:20.124 --> 01:44:24.927]  And we're not going to say their names, turning their back on him over this, because they can't handle the peer pressure.
[01:44:24.927 --> 01:44:28.749]  They can't handle the fact, you know, to see their family member having courage.
[01:44:28.749 --> 01:44:29.910]  They should be toasting him.
[01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:32.091]  They should be carrying him on their shoulders.
[01:44:32.091 --> 01:44:34.193]  But instead, they spit on him.
[01:44:34.833 --> 01:44:40.476]  And here he is, ladies and gentlemen, in a world of cowards, being a man of courage, is a revolutionary act.
[01:44:40.476 --> 01:44:41.777]  And Dan Badani joins us.
[01:44:41.777 --> 01:44:44.318]  Dan, recapping, because you mentioned this as a footnote.
[01:44:44.318 --> 01:44:45.198]  What did they say to you?
[01:44:45.198 --> 01:44:45.959]  What did they do to you?
[01:44:45.959 --> 01:44:47.079]  What did you say back to them?
[01:44:47.079 --> 01:44:51.161]  And now to know this is, this is, that they didn't want you asking those questions.
[01:44:51.161 --> 01:44:52.142]  Here's the big issue.
[01:44:52.142 --> 01:44:56.144]  So they sent Secret Service of Obama, his interpretorian guard.
[01:44:57.188 --> 01:44:59.632]  of literal Gestapo of SS.
[01:44:59.632 --> 01:45:01.756]  The SS was Hitler's inner guard.
[01:45:01.756 --> 01:45:09.910]  The Praetorian Royal Guard sent to stand in front of you and try to shut you down in America because you wanted to hand out pictures of the contractors.
[01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:10.230]  Go ahead.
[01:45:12.076 --> 01:45:14.898]  Well, um, when I got there, I knew he was some kind of agent.
[01:45:14.898 --> 01:45:15.659]  I wasn't sure.
[01:45:15.659 --> 01:45:18.481]  I said it was the FBI, but obviously it's the Secret Service.
[01:45:18.481 --> 01:45:22.284]  But when I sat down, he was, uh, he wanted to sit behind me.
[01:45:22.284 --> 01:45:23.805]  I heard him argue with the guy behind me.
[01:45:23.805 --> 01:45:24.685]  He had to sit there.
[01:45:24.685 --> 01:45:26.387]  His stuff was there, whatever the case.
[01:45:26.387 --> 01:45:31.931]  But, um, he kept peeking over my shoulder every time I sent a text message, every time I got a phone call.
[01:45:31.931 --> 01:45:37.495]  And when I was talking to my camera guy and my partner there, and, um, I knew this guy wasn't a reporter.
[01:45:37.495 --> 01:45:38.476]  He dresses as a reporter.
[01:45:38.476 --> 01:45:39.877]  I was like, this guy's not no reporter.
[01:45:40.517 --> 01:45:41.978]  And, um, he's gonna give me a problem.
[01:45:41.978 --> 01:45:46.601]  So, when I get up to address the people, I have these pictures right here, the very pictures I showed.
[01:45:46.601 --> 01:45:51.805]  He jumps up with his clipboard, blocking the cameras, or trying to anyway, trying to block these photos.
[01:45:51.805 --> 01:45:54.586]  They were hell-bent these pictures wouldn't be shown.
[01:45:54.586 --> 01:45:59.530]  Now, before I went on air, he mentioned, like, when my friend arrived, he gave me these photographs.
[01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:04.952]  And I heard him, uh, yell to some other guy, uh, they got pictures.
[01:46:04.952 --> 01:46:07.593]  They ran in the back of the hallway and said they got pictures.
[01:46:07.593 --> 01:46:14.355]  The woman comes out, uh, the coordinator, and she says to the press, excuse me, everybody, we're gonna delay the, uh, meeting about five minutes.
[01:46:14.355 --> 01:46:15.576]  We gotta get stuff together.
[01:46:15.576 --> 01:46:24.159]  What they were doing is they were trying to come up with a story, and that's why they came out right away, Alex, and they said, do not go to anybody else's pictures but ours.
[01:46:24.159 --> 01:46:25.880]  Don't look anywhere else but our pictures.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.761]  And no other picture is credible.
[01:46:27.761 --> 01:46:31.002]  And these pictures, yeah, these very pictures, I showed to the press anyway.
[01:46:31.002 --> 01:46:34.783]  I got bombarded by agents, FBI agents, and that Secret Service guy.
[01:46:34.783 --> 01:46:36.304]  But I stood up to them.
[01:46:36.304 --> 01:46:37.785]  I said, you know, I'm not afraid of you people.
[01:46:37.785 --> 01:46:40.186]  And I stood right up to them because I'm not.
[01:46:40.186 --> 01:46:43.027]  I have no fear of these people because I have a strong faith in God.
[01:46:43.747 --> 01:46:48.151]  These pictures here were the nuclear bomb of information.
[01:46:48.151 --> 01:46:52.355]  Because I had press swarming me when, of course, the federal agents backed off.
[01:46:52.355 --> 01:46:53.436]  And I showed those pictures.
[01:46:53.436 --> 01:46:56.279]  I said, these pictures can be seen on Infowars.com.
[01:46:56.279 --> 01:46:58.581]  And people went to download these pictures.
[01:46:58.581 --> 01:47:01.844]  And that guy behind me, I knew he was up to no good.
[01:47:01.844 --> 01:47:03.566]  I knew he was up to something.
[01:47:03.566 --> 01:47:05.968]  And even my cameraman mentioned, watch that guy behind you.
[01:47:05.968 --> 01:47:07.730]  Because he was hell-bent on sitting behind me.
[01:47:11.735 --> 01:47:15.798]  We should also give credit to the camera guy if he wants to be public.
[01:47:15.798 --> 01:47:23.405]  I saw Kevin LePrade and Nick M, which was my other partner, was holding the microphone for me.
[01:47:23.405 --> 01:47:26.547]  Kevin LePrade and Nick M, they're good friends of mine.
[01:47:26.547 --> 01:47:27.748]  They belong to activist groups.
[01:47:27.748 --> 01:47:29.110]  I forgot the group he belongs to.
[01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:32.613]  Well Dan, listen, here's the bottom line.
[01:47:32.613 --> 01:47:37.837]  They acted totally suspicious about the other photos, the other people.
[01:47:37.837 --> 01:47:39.839]  One of the Saudis has now ended up dead in a river.
[01:47:41.156 --> 01:47:42.536]  That may have happened before.
[01:47:42.536 --> 01:47:43.157]  Who knows?
[01:47:43.157 --> 01:47:46.777]  It may not be related, but I predicted that the people would end up in the river.
[01:47:46.777 --> 01:47:49.298]  I actually said that over and over again because I've seen it before.
[01:47:49.298 --> 01:47:51.218]  I hope people realize what we're doing here.
[01:47:51.218 --> 01:47:53.519]  I mean, I'm not asking people to go, oh, you've got so much courage.
[01:47:53.519 --> 01:47:54.599]  Oh, you're so great.
[01:47:54.599 --> 01:47:58.440]  But we literally are standing directly up to the beast.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:02.961]  And now a senator has come out and said it looks like they had prior knowledge and stood down.
[01:48:02.961 --> 01:48:04.102]  We know that there was a drill.
[01:48:04.102 --> 01:48:05.122]  That's now been confirmed.
[01:48:06.064 --> 01:48:10.508]  Now it's come out that the older brother Tamerlan was CIA.
[01:48:10.508 --> 01:48:11.228]  Of course he was.
[01:48:11.228 --> 01:48:13.851]  He was allowed to go in and out with fake name.
[01:48:13.851 --> 01:48:18.134]  I mean, that stuff doesn't work unless they want it to work.
[01:48:18.134 --> 01:48:23.599]  And now he's hooked in with Zbigniew Brzezinski, who runs the operations to destabilize Russia.
[01:48:25.925 --> 01:48:27.145]  Unbelievable.
[01:48:27.145 --> 01:48:29.186]  And I just want to say one thing, too, if I could.
[01:48:29.186 --> 01:48:31.667]  Everybody's giving me these compliments.
[01:48:31.667 --> 01:48:33.908]  You know, my credit, all that stuff goes to God.
[01:48:33.908 --> 01:48:35.608]  Glory to God, not me.
[01:48:35.608 --> 01:48:37.029]  And I want to say one thing.
[01:48:37.029 --> 01:48:41.170]  I'm from the smallest town in the smallest state in the country, literally.
[01:48:41.170 --> 01:48:45.912]  My town is one square mile from Central Falls, and we're from Rhode Island, which is a small state.
[01:48:45.912 --> 01:48:50.533]  So if one man can stand up against the global elite and make a difference, you can, too.
[01:48:50.533 --> 01:48:52.794]  You know, Alex says all the time, you are the resistance.
[01:48:53.334 --> 01:48:54.535]  And it doesn't matter who you are.
[01:48:54.535 --> 01:48:55.836]  I'm not a great speaker.
[01:48:55.836 --> 01:48:56.896]  I don't have a pretty face.
[01:48:56.896 --> 01:49:01.139]  I don't like those, you know, the reporters on CNN that read from teleprompters.
[01:49:01.139 --> 01:49:03.640]  You know, and I exposed that too when I bullhorned the sidewalk.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.901]  You're a man who loves liberty and loves your family.
[01:49:05.901 --> 01:49:10.224]  You're not going to be, you have an instinct to not be a slave.
[01:49:10.224 --> 01:49:14.226]  And it's that instinct, Dan, that has done everything good in the world.
[01:49:14.226 --> 01:49:17.208]  It's that instinct that has created civilization.
[01:49:17.208 --> 01:49:18.729]  It's not bending over to bullies.
[01:49:20.808 --> 01:49:26.490]  Absolutely, and I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees, like George Washington said.
[01:49:26.490 --> 01:49:30.172]  Well, tell us the kind of stuff, because I remember you were off-air saying they were really getting in your face.
[01:49:30.172 --> 01:49:34.614]  What did Obama's personal Secret Service people say to you?
[01:49:34.614 --> 01:49:37.715]  Well, um, when I was trying to ask the questions, he was behind me heckling me.
[01:49:37.715 --> 01:49:41.296]  Shut up, shut up, and you hand me the camera, telling it's my First Amendment, back the hell off.
[01:49:41.296 --> 01:49:44.418]  And, uh, you know, I was very, you know, because these people are very rude.
[01:49:44.418 --> 01:49:45.878]  He was out there, like, shutting me down.
[01:49:45.878 --> 01:49:50.320]  But what about the photos where he's in your face, right up in your space, and you point your finger back in his face?
[01:49:52.188 --> 01:49:55.471]  Oh yeah, he jumps right up, I mean, because he was expecting that.
[01:49:55.471 --> 01:50:02.818]  He jumps up and gets his clipboard, and he's trying to block the photos, you know, from the camera, you know, these very photos here.
[01:50:02.818 --> 01:50:09.223]  And of course I put him with two hands, he can't block both, and it's just like, and he was like telling me, sit down, shut up, blah, blah, you know.
[01:50:09.223 --> 01:50:12.126]  That's what they do now, they protect the lie.
[01:50:12.126 --> 01:50:13.848]  They protect the fraud.
[01:50:13.848 --> 01:50:15.809]  They protect Kim Jong-un.
[01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:17.231]  They protect the dictator.
[01:50:18.348 --> 01:50:19.809]  And I'm just gonna be furiated.
[01:50:19.809 --> 01:50:21.751]  I mean, these people think they can intimidate me.
[01:50:21.751 --> 01:50:22.951]  And I'm not no superhero.
[01:50:22.951 --> 01:50:23.752]  I'm not.
[01:50:23.752 --> 01:50:24.653]  I'm just sick of it.
[01:50:24.653 --> 01:50:25.493]  Like you are, Alex.
[01:50:25.493 --> 01:50:26.254]  I'm sick of it.
[01:50:26.254 --> 01:50:27.655]  And you know what?
[01:50:27.655 --> 01:50:30.017]  I know my life's at stake and yours as well.
[01:50:30.017 --> 01:50:32.118]  And I know what's all involved here.
[01:50:32.118 --> 01:50:33.039]  But you know, I don't care.
[01:50:33.039 --> 01:50:38.203]  My founding fathers, your founding fathers, our founding fathers, they made that sacrifice for us.
[01:50:38.203 --> 01:50:39.103]  So you know what?
[01:50:39.103 --> 01:50:42.146]  It's our turn to make the sacrifice for our kids and our grandkids someday.
[01:50:42.706 --> 01:50:44.927]  And, you know, that's why I'm not afraid, because... That's right.
[01:50:44.927 --> 01:50:46.388]  Stay there, and then I'll come back with calls.
[01:50:46.388 --> 01:50:47.128]  Stay there.
[01:50:47.128 --> 01:50:47.608]  Absolutely.
[01:50:47.608 --> 01:50:48.889]  They think we're beat.
[01:50:48.889 --> 01:50:49.830]  They think it's over.
[01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:54.792]  They think they can gut the whole country, suck us dry, shut down our energy systems.
[01:50:54.792 --> 01:50:56.273]  You're the first thing you bomb.
[01:50:56.273 --> 01:50:57.253]  You bomb power plants.
[01:50:57.253 --> 01:50:58.734]  They're shutting them down.
[01:50:58.734 --> 01:51:00.775]  I mean, we are being shut down right now.
[01:51:00.775 --> 01:51:02.376]  We're being re-educated.
[01:51:02.376 --> 01:51:02.976]  But you know what?
[01:51:02.976 --> 01:51:04.357]  America's waking up.
[01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:06.678]  We're not done yet, you globalist, murdering scum.
[01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:12.016]  Sergeant Dave Scott, Army Search and Rescue Veteran, wants you to hear this urgent message.
[01:51:12.016 --> 01:51:20.320]  All emergencies have casualties, but in America, most casualties from storms like Katrina and Sandy only happen because good people were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:21.741]  Don't let that happen to you.

[01:51:41.831 --> 01:51:48.034]  If Obama has his way, all guns will be either banned, restricted or confiscated, possibly by executive order.
[01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:50.395]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[01:51:50.395 --> 01:51:53.036]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away.

[01:52:07.833 --> 01:52:12.595]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:12.595 --> 01:52:15.636]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:15.636 --> 01:52:24.599]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:24.599 --> 01:52:29.501]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:30.151 --> 01:52:41.523]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:52:41.523 --> 01:52:48.531]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:52:49.191 --> 01:52:53.496]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:52:53.496 --> 01:52:57.100]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:04.367]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:53:04.367 --> 01:53:05.628]  Protect your immune system.
[01:53:05.628 --> 01:53:06.690]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:53:07.290 --> 01:53:09.231]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:53:09.231 --> 01:53:11.372]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:53:11.372 --> 01:53:17.055]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:53:17.055 --> 01:53:21.077]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:53:21.077 --> 01:53:24.979]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:53:24.979 --> 01:53:26.359]  The fact is, you are.
[01:53:26.359 --> 01:53:27.380]  We all are.
[01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:29.701]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:53:30.001 --> 01:53:38.486]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:53:38.486 --> 01:53:39.887]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:53:39.887 --> 01:53:43.329]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:53:43.329 --> 01:53:45.711]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:53:45.711 --> 01:53:50.233]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[01:53:50.233 --> 01:53:56.097]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:53:56.337 --> 01:53:57.999]  And check out their spring specials.
[01:53:57.999 --> 01:54:04.467]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:54:04.467 --> 01:54:06.330]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:54:08.174 --> 01:54:20.842]  We're back live.
[01:54:20.842 --> 01:54:27.846]  One more segment with Badandi, then I'm going to push our next guest back to about 15 after so I can get to these calls.
[01:54:27.846 --> 01:54:29.347]  Then we'll get an update from Lindsey Williams.
[01:54:31.325 --> 01:54:32.306]  Look, I just want to say this.
[01:54:32.306 --> 01:54:43.175]  I kind of get wound up to not even have courage to do this, but I mean, when I look at this evidence and then do what I do, you automatically get aggressive because you know you're fighting bad people.
[01:54:43.175 --> 01:54:45.397]  But I want to be very, very crystal clear here.
[01:54:45.397 --> 01:54:50.100]  The police, most of the FBI, most of the Secret Service are not involved in this.
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.983]  And they really believe they're good guys working for a good system.
[01:54:56.317 --> 01:55:03.683]  To use the movie analogy, just like Tom Cruise thinks he's working for the good guys in Oblivion, but he finds out otherwise.
[01:55:03.683 --> 01:55:04.764]  And that's what history's shown.
[01:55:04.764 --> 01:55:11.549]  Most German soldiers, including SS, really thought they were doing good work.
[01:55:11.549 --> 01:55:14.712]  And they really believe these guys acted alone.
[01:55:14.712 --> 01:55:18.355]  They're not going to look at them being CIA, even if it's admitted, they don't want to look at that.
[01:55:20.117 --> 01:55:25.760]  Because they're all caught up in the pageantry and the funerals and they're the heroes and all this stuff.
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:32.564]  And they attach all this tyranny, martial law, to the new USA, USA.
[01:55:32.564 --> 01:55:33.565]  This is all a program.
[01:55:34.710 --> 01:55:55.119]  You learn how it looks, then you go, man, that looks like the past stuff, and sure enough, okay, we'll see if there's a drill, we'll see if there was prior knowledge, we'll see if there's a stand-down, we'll see if they were sent overseas in CIA training for Brzezinski groups, and then it's public, enrolled in Brzezinski groups with the terror groups.
[01:55:55.119 --> 01:55:58.501]  I mean, it's like, it's so painful.
[01:55:58.501 --> 01:56:00.422]  I wish they were real terrorists.
[01:56:01.764 --> 01:56:03.004]  Every day.
[01:56:03.004 --> 01:56:09.307]  I don't want to come up here and say things that freak people out and are unpopular, but I have a responsibility to do it.
[01:56:09.307 --> 01:56:15.069]  And of course, now you notice it's coming out, so we become even more popular.
[01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:16.329]  But that's not even my goal.
[01:56:16.329 --> 01:56:20.891]  I mean, getting more popular... I'd rather the New World Order subside, because believe me, I don't want to die.
[01:56:20.891 --> 01:56:25.993]  I don't want them to kill me or go after my family, but you know what?
[01:56:25.993 --> 01:56:28.434]  These people are so bad, it's got to be done.
[01:56:29.574 --> 01:56:30.535]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:56:30.535 --> 01:56:39.142]  If they were just, as I've said a thousand times, if they were boss hog corrupt, they just wanted to steal stuff and run things and, you know, I could argue, well, at least they'll trickle down to the economy.
[01:56:39.142 --> 01:56:47.688]  I'd still resist them, but I wouldn't just 110% study how to resist them historically using the truth and try to hurt them as bad as I could.
[01:56:47.688 --> 01:56:50.831]  I mean, I really am trying to get in their business.
[01:56:50.831 --> 01:56:51.932]  And they kill people that do that.
[01:56:52.796 --> 01:56:57.502]  But they haven't killed me because they go, you kill that guy, it'll make everybody listen to him even more.
[01:56:57.502 --> 01:56:59.585]  They're like, it doesn't matter, I want to kill him!
[01:56:59.585 --> 01:57:01.688]  And there may be a faction that does that.
[01:57:01.688 --> 01:57:03.931]  Just know, I chose that path.
[01:57:03.931 --> 01:57:05.253]  Because that's God's path.
[01:57:05.253 --> 01:57:07.035]  Whatever God wants, it's in God's hands.
[01:57:07.796 --> 01:57:10.037]  They can't kill me if God doesn't want that.
[01:57:10.037 --> 01:57:12.678]  But I'm telling you, everybody should do what Dan Bodondi did.
[01:57:12.678 --> 01:57:21.160]  Everybody listening and watching should go out with simple questions at press conferences, call it your own local news site, create your own site, and just go calmly in a suit and ask questions.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.701]  You will bring them down just asking questions.
[01:57:23.701 --> 01:57:32.764]  They were scared to death of one man talking about a drill that was in the Boston Globe!
[01:57:32.764 --> 01:57:35.825]  The only reason they're powerful is because you're scared of them!
[01:57:36.909 --> 01:57:37.989]  And they are dangerous now.
[01:57:37.989 --> 01:57:39.370]  They are powerful.
[01:57:39.370 --> 01:57:40.890]  But we're powerful too.
[01:57:40.890 --> 01:57:46.331]  And the God that's in us is a lot stronger than the God that's in them.
[01:57:46.331 --> 01:57:48.552]  They're the God of this world.
[01:57:48.552 --> 01:57:50.792]  I serve the God of the universe.
[01:57:50.792 --> 01:57:54.433]  Not this little world.
[01:57:54.433 --> 01:57:56.514]  Real fast, Madonna, you got one minute to finish up any points.
[01:57:57.527 --> 01:58:00.669]  Real quick, I want to give credit to the Free American Patriots movement.
[01:58:00.669 --> 01:58:02.150]  The guys helped me out a lot.
[01:58:02.150 --> 01:58:02.970]  They gave me the pictures.
[01:58:02.970 --> 01:58:04.031]  They were great.
[01:58:04.031 --> 01:58:07.573]  I just want to say again, man.
[01:58:07.573 --> 01:58:10.035]  My family, my whole girlfriend's family disowned me.
[01:58:10.035 --> 01:58:11.796]  I'm barred from my girlfriend's house.
[01:58:11.796 --> 01:58:15.518]  My girlfriend's standing against the family and all that.
[01:58:15.518 --> 01:58:16.819]  My life is a miserable hell.
[01:58:16.819 --> 01:58:20.681]  I got half my family that wants to disown me because of what I did.
[01:58:20.681 --> 01:58:25.144]  The thing is, I don't even care about that because I care about my kid's future.
[01:58:25.144 --> 01:58:27.045]  I care about everybody's future.
[01:58:27.245 --> 01:58:27.906]  Absolutely.
[01:58:27.906 --> 01:58:29.086]  Hey, Mark Twain.
[01:58:29.086 --> 01:58:32.208]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared.
[01:58:32.208 --> 01:58:34.490]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him.
[01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:36.551]  Because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:58:36.551 --> 01:58:37.352]  Dan, anything else?
[01:58:37.352 --> 01:58:41.015]  Um, just want to say, get out there, people.
[01:58:41.015 --> 01:58:41.615]  Get out there.
[01:58:41.615 --> 01:58:42.456]  Look at the cameras.
[01:58:42.456 --> 01:58:45.017]  Get out there, ask the real questions, and do not be afraid.
[01:58:45.017 --> 01:58:45.798]  Do not be afraid.
[01:58:45.798 --> 01:58:48.540]  God bless you.

[02:00:24.825 --> 02:00:29.647]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.647 --> 02:00:34.129]  There are many strengths that flow through the veins of men and women.
[02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:36.550]  But physical strength is not even the most important.
[02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:40.072]  It's always been the moral courage to do what's right.
[02:00:42.307 --> 02:00:43.968]  And that is the courage that we lack.
[02:00:43.968 --> 02:00:49.151]  We become lazy, we believe what the establishment says, or even if we know they're lying, we say, well, what can you change?
[02:00:49.151 --> 02:00:51.072]  Well, nothing if you lay down.
[02:00:51.072 --> 02:00:52.432]  Let's go to your phone calls here.
[02:00:52.432 --> 02:00:56.615]  Big breaking news coming up in the next segment on this Wednesday edition.
[02:00:56.615 --> 02:00:59.496]  Let's go ahead and talk to Liz in California.
[02:00:59.496 --> 02:01:00.537]  You're on the air, Liz.
[02:01:00.537 --> 02:01:01.037]  Thanks for holding.
[02:01:02.179 --> 02:01:04.261]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:01:04.261 --> 02:01:09.566]  This call is about that kid that was wearing the t-shirt, uh, protecting the second amendment, right?
[02:01:09.566 --> 02:01:16.111]  Yeah, I know, it was an NRA milquetoast t-shirt with an American Eagle on it, 8th graders suspended over t-shirt, returns to school.
[02:01:16.111 --> 02:01:18.293]  Guys, document cam, go ahead ma'am.
[02:01:18.293 --> 02:01:20.435]  Okay, here's my idea.
[02:01:20.435 --> 02:01:28.102]  I think just like how the Tea Party organized, there should be an organization one day for, uh, all, uh,
[02:01:28.607 --> 02:01:35.321]  Young patriots and Christians, that they should all wear t-shirts that say something like,
[02:01:39.193 --> 02:01:45.357]  Absolutely, because the separation of church and state means the government can't be involved in your religion.
[02:01:45.357 --> 02:01:51.581]  Not that you're a member of the state and can't wear a shirt saying, I love Jesus at the mall or at a public school.
[02:01:51.581 --> 02:01:54.062]  They cannot bar you from doing that.
[02:01:54.062 --> 02:01:55.623]  It's just a total lie.
[02:01:55.623 --> 02:01:58.305]  Just like you can wear NRA t-shirts if you want.
[02:01:58.305 --> 02:02:02.868]  I think we should organize some school, maybe in Austin, we have so many listeners, where maybe a hundred children
[02:02:03.268 --> 02:02:05.849]  Wear a shirt saying, I defend the Second Amendment.
[02:02:05.849 --> 02:02:08.510]  And watch the authoritarians throw them out.
[02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:11.971]  The idea of even a civil rights group isn't allowed.
[02:02:11.971 --> 02:02:14.192]  You see what tyranny that is?
[02:02:14.192 --> 02:02:19.994]  Yeah, and I think that this should be organized all through every state.
[02:02:19.994 --> 02:02:22.314]  Every state, every school.
[02:02:22.314 --> 02:02:28.276]  And let's see how the left teachers and principals react to that.
[02:02:28.276 --> 02:02:29.817]  And what kind of reaction we get.
[02:02:32.196 --> 02:02:32.476]  I don't
[02:02:51.690 --> 02:02:55.311]  That communism is what rebels against tyranny, that anti-gun is good.
[02:02:55.311 --> 02:02:59.532]  Why wouldn't Hispanics want to be capitalists and all the wealth that comes from it and be able to own guns?
[02:02:59.532 --> 02:03:00.693]  Well, most of them do.
[02:03:00.693 --> 02:03:07.315]  But they then say, oh, kids can't wear American flags because it makes the Mexican kids mad.
[02:03:07.315 --> 02:03:09.896]  And it turned out it was Hispanic kids mainly.
[02:03:09.896 --> 02:03:13.937]  Of the, I think, eight kids suspended, six said, you saw them on the news, they were Hispanic.
[02:03:15.178 --> 02:03:21.004]  Uh, and one of them just wore an old Navy shirt, I think it was, or American apparel, I forget.
[02:03:21.004 --> 02:03:21.624]  He was on the news.
[02:03:22.938 --> 02:03:28.180]  And then they said you can't be here one week, so they came back wearing shirts saying, I'm sick of this!
[02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:29.321]  This is America!
[02:03:29.321 --> 02:03:30.961]  I want to be an American!
[02:03:30.961 --> 02:03:31.241]  Okay?
[02:03:31.241 --> 02:03:39.025]  You know, it's like I've got German and French and Scots and Irish and English and all these other backgrounds.
[02:03:39.025 --> 02:03:43.266]  I don't call myself a Alsatian.
[02:03:43.266 --> 02:03:45.768]  I don't call myself a Scot.
[02:03:45.768 --> 02:03:48.649]  I don't call myself a Welsh person.
[02:03:49.389 --> 02:03:52.089]  I'm probably more Welsh than anything else.
[02:03:52.089 --> 02:03:53.970]  I've seen people named Jones from England.
[02:03:53.970 --> 02:03:55.690]  It's a strong resemblance.
[02:03:55.690 --> 02:04:00.291]  I've met people who are Welsh from Wales.
[02:04:00.291 --> 02:04:08.152]  But the point is that it's amazing that they've engaged in this divide and conquer.
[02:04:08.152 --> 02:04:12.493]  And in America, that's not liberalism, that you can't wear an American flag shirt.
[02:04:12.493 --> 02:04:18.214]  That is crazy authoritarians who want to totally dominate you, and that's a re-education camp.
[02:04:18.214 --> 02:04:18.534]  Go ahead.
[02:04:19.727 --> 02:04:25.881]  Well that's why I think we need to organize and have all these young patriots wear t-shirts on the same day.
[02:04:25.881 --> 02:04:28.848]  I mean Muslim people of Muslim faith can wear their
[02:04:30.311 --> 02:04:36.375]  Listen, listen, I heard Mankow say this a month ago when I was on a show, and I believed him, but I went and looked it up.
[02:04:36.375 --> 02:04:44.039]  The Saudi Arabians are allowed to wear their headdresses and their turbans and all that coming into the country, but citizens can't.
[02:04:44.039 --> 02:04:48.922]  Because it's not about, and I'm not saying the Muslims are terrorists, period, I'm saying it's all made up.
[02:04:48.922 --> 02:04:51.223]  It's about breaking us and training us.
[02:04:51.223 --> 02:04:51.944]  We have no rights.
[02:04:51.944 --> 02:04:53.445]  Do you agree?
[02:04:53.445 --> 02:04:56.887]  Yes, let's have National Christian Day at the schools.
[02:04:58.191 --> 02:04:59.533]  I'm calling for it.
[02:04:59.533 --> 02:05:00.534]  Absolutely.
[02:05:00.534 --> 02:05:06.141]  National First Amendment Day, which includes freedom of religion, and you can't bar what...
[02:05:12.193 --> 02:05:13.454]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:13.454 --> 02:05:17.156]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:17.156 --> 02:05:19.617]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:19.617 --> 02:05:25.480]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:31.723]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:32.143 --> 02:05:38.125]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:38.125 --> 02:05:42.306]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:42.306 --> 02:05:46.587]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:46.587 --> 02:05:52.529]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:52.529 --> 02:05:56.090]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:56.090 --> 02:05:58.071]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:58.071 --> 02:05:58.491]  It's here.

[02:06:08.396 --> 02:06:10.197]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:06:10.197 --> 02:06:12.758]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:06:12.758 --> 02:06:18.221]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:06:18.221 --> 02:06:22.263]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:06:22.263 --> 02:06:26.185]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:06:26.185 --> 02:06:27.585]  The fact is, you are.
[02:06:27.585 --> 02:06:28.606]  We all are.
[02:06:28.606 --> 02:06:30.947]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:06:31.247 --> 02:06:39.809]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[02:06:57.794 --> 02:07:02.356]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[02:07:33.482 --> 02:07:37.625]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:07:37.625 --> 02:07:43.829]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:07:44.549 --> 02:07:55.814]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[02:08:10.945 --> 02:08:12.847]  We're good to go.
[02:08:31.448 --> 02:08:38.632]  You know, it hurts my feelings when I read on Infowars.com cops that sound like they're really good people going, hey, we don't want to die.
[02:08:38.632 --> 02:08:42.394]  We don't want to go home dead to our family.
[02:08:42.394 --> 02:08:45.716]  You know, we want to be able to protect ourselves.
[02:08:45.716 --> 02:08:48.598]  There could have been terrorists that they were with in any house.
[02:08:48.598 --> 02:08:48.998]  Well, yeah.
[02:08:48.998 --> 02:08:51.640]  And I mean, there could be 10 foot tall blood drinking lizards, too.
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:51.840]  I mean,
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:54.523]  There's a reason we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:08:54.523 --> 02:09:05.517]  There's a reason we've never seen this in an American city, locking down most of a city, pointing guns at everybody, including black women and blondes, who clearly aren't your suspect.
[02:09:05.517 --> 02:09:06.699]  Well, you could have been with them!
[02:09:07.679 --> 02:09:09.521]  And this cop sent me an email.
[02:09:09.521 --> 02:09:10.662]  At the end of the show I'm going to read this.
[02:09:10.662 --> 02:09:12.623]  We got Lindsey Williams giving us an update.
[02:09:12.623 --> 02:09:17.528]  He says breaking new news from his elite friend.
[02:09:17.528 --> 02:09:19.249]  So that is coming up.
[02:09:19.249 --> 02:09:20.670]  And I know who his source is.
[02:09:20.670 --> 02:09:22.412]  It is someone who's attended Bilderberg.
[02:09:22.412 --> 02:09:24.153]  It's always interesting so we'll get that perspective.
[02:09:24.153 --> 02:09:25.575]  I'm going to continue with your calls.
[02:09:25.575 --> 02:09:27.837]  Let's move quick now because I'm pushing him back to go to these calls.
[02:09:27.837 --> 02:09:29.298]  I'm sorry to make you hold so long.
[02:09:29.298 --> 02:09:31.400]  But you know that's what I do.
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:32.260]  It's teleprompter free.
[02:09:33.001 --> 02:09:35.343]  It's governor free, by the way, as well.
[02:09:35.343 --> 02:09:38.687]  There's nobody in control in here but me, and I'm not in control.
[02:09:38.687 --> 02:09:39.928]  Kind of scary, isn't it?
[02:09:39.928 --> 02:09:41.649]  Nick in New York, you're on the air.
[02:09:41.649 --> 02:09:43.932]  Welcome.
[02:09:43.932 --> 02:09:46.074]  Alex, buddy, hail Cobra.
[02:09:46.074 --> 02:09:47.135]  What's going on today?
[02:09:47.135 --> 02:09:48.236]  Hail Cobra!
[02:09:56.254 --> 02:10:03.098]  I saw the awesome Oblivion last night, and that was an amazing film, I have to say.
[02:10:03.098 --> 02:10:06.880]  I don't like Tom Cruise, and it made me like him.
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:09.462]  And again, it's because, did you get all the messages?
[02:10:09.462 --> 02:10:22.530]  It's pro-male, it's all wholesome, it's about family and generations, it's about kinship, it's about love, and it's about sacrifice, death, and it's about compartmentalization.
[02:10:22.530 --> 02:10:24.031]  Was it heavy like I said it was?
[02:10:25.948 --> 02:10:27.508]  It's something you don't see anymore.
[02:10:27.508 --> 02:10:28.188]  That's the thing.
[02:10:28.188 --> 02:10:40.391]  I mean, not only was it an amazing sci-fi film, but it had every aspect of hope, and we can get through this, and we can save the day.
[02:10:40.391 --> 02:10:51.612]  Well, I feel like Morgan Freedman, when I'm arguing with somebody about the New World Order, and he's sitting there arguing with the Tom Cruise astronaut character, and he won't even argue with him.
[02:10:51.612 --> 02:10:54.153]  He just goes, uh-huh, that's what you think's going on.
[02:10:55.265 --> 02:10:58.648]  It's just like, because we know we're right.
[02:10:58.648 --> 02:11:03.091]  You know, I mean, some things we're wrong about on the edges, but we know generally how right we are.
[02:11:03.091 --> 02:11:06.654]  It's like a joke how right we are and having to argue with people.
[02:11:06.654 --> 02:11:15.362]  That's why when we get attacked in the media or they say, I'm connected to the bombings now, you know, and the Associated Press and all this, it's just, it's just flailing.
[02:11:15.842 --> 02:11:20.706]  And then you know how evil the top of the pyramid is, literally, Oblivion, the black pyramid.
[02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:27.331]  Hey, what do you think of the cover of the October issue being the bad guy from Oblivion, which they will not let that image out, I've discovered.
[02:11:27.331 --> 02:11:30.494]  They're really shutting it down when it gets out on the web.
[02:11:30.494 --> 02:11:33.556]  What did you think of the bad guy in the movie?
[02:11:33.556 --> 02:11:35.858]  What, the eye at the end?
[02:11:35.858 --> 02:11:38.340]  Yeah, the big black upside-down pyramid with the red eye, yeah.
[02:11:40.924 --> 02:11:48.807]  I mean, the bad guy is the Illuminati, a technocratic, psychopathic entity.
[02:11:48.807 --> 02:11:56.990]  Well, you know what I thought was funny was when, before the movie started, when the Universal logo came around, I didn't know anything about this film.
[02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:59.031]  I never read the graphic novel.
[02:11:59.031 --> 02:12:04.533]  I went in there basically, I turned you off yesterday when you were talking about it because I'm like, I just want to see this film.
[02:12:04.533 --> 02:12:08.355]  So I did not know anything about the, you know, the pyramid or anything.
[02:12:09.315 --> 02:12:16.879]  But when I first saw the Universal logo coming around and I saw that, that pyramid, I was like, wait a minute, are they really being this obnoxious now?
[02:12:16.879 --> 02:12:18.600]  Like, I didn't know that was part of the film.
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:22.402]  And then when I started in the film, I was like, all right, well, that makes sense.
[02:12:22.402 --> 02:12:28.205]  But I mean, you know, there's a lot of symbolism in the film that majority of the audiences will not get.
[02:12:28.385 --> 02:12:28.946]  No, no, no.
[02:12:28.946 --> 02:12:30.327]  I'm going to be honest.
[02:12:30.327 --> 02:12:34.951]  We had rush tickets and a bunch of stuff and probably could have got backstage and stuff.
[02:12:34.951 --> 02:12:38.775]  But I didn't go to rush last night because I went back to see with my wife again because she wanted to see it.
[02:12:38.775 --> 02:12:40.877]  Plus I ran home and saw the kids.
[02:12:40.877 --> 02:12:44.540]  But I went back just to try to like see it again when I wasn't tired.
[02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:45.822]  And it's just the whole thing.
[02:12:45.822 --> 02:12:47.763]  It's definitely anti-Illuminati.
[02:12:47.763 --> 02:12:48.925]  It is not.
[02:12:48.925 --> 02:12:52.288]  It is not a revelation of the method externalization of the hierarchy.
[02:12:52.288 --> 02:12:53.229]  Do you agree with that analysis?
[02:12:55.140 --> 02:12:56.480]  No, totally, totally.
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:09.023]  The thing, I called yesterday to bring up, I mean, you haven't touched on this yet, but have you seen the, or just to know about the Associated Press yesterday being hacked?
[02:13:09.023 --> 02:13:11.963]  Yeah, and saying the White House had been blown up?
[02:13:11.963 --> 02:13:21.605]  Yeah, I mean, I don't really, I didn't really see much press about that, and I know you guys haven't discussed it yet, but I wondered what your insights of that was.
[02:13:23.436 --> 02:13:29.758]  Okay, well, the Syrian Free Army really is Syrian hackers, and they hacked CBS and put out stuff like the government's funding Al-Qaeda.
[02:13:29.758 --> 02:13:34.460]  It was all basically Assad stuff, so that was accurate, because I've seen them hack before.
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:37.821]  They did stuff like hack satellites with the Russians and show that the U.S.
[02:13:37.821 --> 02:13:40.222]  was, not the U.S., the globalists have hijacked our country.
[02:13:40.222 --> 02:13:42.403]  Might as well be aliens for that part.
[02:13:42.403 --> 02:13:43.263]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[02:13:43.263 --> 02:13:44.604]  It might as well be, you know, like,
[02:13:45.084 --> 02:13:48.987]  Slugs that climbed in Obama's ear and are running it from Planet Pop-Tart.
[02:13:48.987 --> 02:13:50.328]  That's how evil they are.
[02:13:50.328 --> 02:13:51.549]  How anti-human they are.
[02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:54.591]  They literally are just anathema.
[02:13:54.591 --> 02:13:57.773]  They're oblivion to everything in our society.
[02:13:57.773 --> 02:14:01.136]  But I believe they're doing that to get CISPA through the Senate.
[02:14:01.696 --> 02:14:07.380]  Because, you know, you can tell when I do a hack and it's ineffectual, and it doesn't really hurt them.
[02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:16.106]  You know, I mean, if there were hacks saying, this CIA group is involved kidnapping kids and doing snuff films, you'd know it's real.
[02:14:16.106 --> 02:14:23.310]  But if it's a hack, you know, of something silly, or something that, you know, makes it look like the President's under threat, that's them.
[02:14:23.310 --> 02:14:25.792]  Because, see, that fits into Olympus is Falling.
[02:14:27.682 --> 02:14:28.723]  That I haven't seen.
[02:14:28.723 --> 02:14:30.464]  I have no desire to see that film.
[02:14:30.464 --> 02:14:31.185]  Programming.
[02:14:31.185 --> 02:14:31.785]  Programming.
[02:14:31.785 --> 02:14:37.670]  Yeah, no, I saw it, and it was like half cops in the audience, you know, shuffling around, and it was like programming.
[02:14:37.670 --> 02:14:39.852]  It was like, it was like fake battle programming.
[02:14:39.852 --> 02:14:44.756]  They have to have an enemy they believe they're fighting, so they have to have an occasional bombing and hype it up, but it's just programming.
[02:14:44.756 --> 02:14:52.762]  The brain takes it as real, so cops are walking around looking behind dumpsters and, you know, doing head rolls and hoo-hoo-hoo in the shower, you know, like al-Qaeda's everywhere.
[02:14:52.762 --> 02:14:54.304]  Meanwhile, the new world order runs America.
[02:14:54.784 --> 02:14:59.310]  You know, the devil force runs America, runs the world, and runs Al-Qaeda.
[02:14:59.310 --> 02:15:00.211]  But he just doesn't compute.
[02:15:00.211 --> 02:15:03.335]  I'm like, hey cops, the government runs Al-Qaeda, here's Reuters.
[02:15:04.554 --> 02:15:06.896]  Yeah, that's what Al-Qaeda probably say, Jones.
[02:15:06.896 --> 02:15:07.817]  You with them?
[02:15:07.817 --> 02:15:09.418]  And now the AP says I'm with them, see?
[02:15:09.418 --> 02:15:11.199]  And it must be true.
[02:15:11.199 --> 02:15:14.041]  I mean, you know, I'm so evil I don't love the government.
[02:15:14.041 --> 02:15:15.382]  I mean, I must be with Al-Qaeda.
[02:15:15.382 --> 02:15:16.523]  Thank you for the call, Nick.
[02:15:16.523 --> 02:15:21.447]  We're going to go to break here in a moment and come back with Lindsey Williams with breaking news here.
[02:15:21.447 --> 02:15:23.509]  Derek, and I'm told we now have him on the lines.
[02:15:23.509 --> 02:15:24.189]  We're going to him in a moment.
[02:15:24.189 --> 02:15:25.871]  Thank you for joining us, Lindsey.
[02:15:25.871 --> 02:15:27.372]  Let's go to Derek in Canada.
[02:15:27.372 --> 02:15:28.352]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:15:28.352 --> 02:15:28.693]  Go ahead.
[02:15:30.009 --> 02:15:31.550]  Hey Alex, good show today man.
[02:15:31.550 --> 02:15:33.011]  Thank you.
[02:15:33.011 --> 02:15:41.735]  I'd like to address a popular photo circulating and possible use of actors involved at the actual bomb site.
[02:15:41.735 --> 02:15:56.162]  The one I'm talking about in particular, the media is really showing this a lot, of the guy that supposedly just lost two of his legs being helped by a guy in a cowboy hat and he's on a wheelchair.
[02:15:56.162 --> 02:15:58.204]  There's actually a series of photos on this guide but
[02:15:59.931 --> 02:16:15.883]  Um, if someone has done sort of like a closer, um, kind of looked at the close up shots of the bomb site itself, and it shows a hooded man in sunglasses, what looks like he's like, dropping the guy on the ground.
[02:16:15.883 --> 02:16:21.387]  And then like all these sort of other suspicious looking photos where I mean, there's like
[02:16:21.977 --> 02:16:25.141]  There's no actual blood squirting from this guy.
[02:16:25.141 --> 02:16:26.783]  It's like, you know, two legs.
[02:16:26.783 --> 02:16:28.485]  Well, that's because they would have put a tourniquet on it.
[02:16:28.485 --> 02:16:30.648]  Let me just stop something here.
[02:16:30.648 --> 02:16:37.136]  They clearly had actors on 9-11 go and put out the official story.
[02:16:38.687 --> 02:16:44.494]  Over and over and over again that it was jet fuel that did it pancaking and then it fell into its own footprint.
[02:16:44.494 --> 02:16:47.138]  They clearly announced Building 7 had fallen before it fell.
[02:16:47.138 --> 02:16:48.659]  They false started on that.
[02:16:48.659 --> 02:16:50.322]  But the event was real.
[02:16:50.322 --> 02:16:52.624]  Sandy Hook, Aurora was real.
[02:16:52.624 --> 02:16:56.709]  They clearly have had, we proved this and I didn't even go with it.
[02:16:57.430 --> 02:16:59.313]  Because I said the media will attack us.
[02:16:59.313 --> 02:17:06.543]  We found two of the people are actually pretty successful actors and admit they're actors and even use their real names.
[02:17:06.543 --> 02:17:09.647]  But I thought, well, maybe real actors could just actually be in the movie theater.
[02:17:09.647 --> 02:17:11.650]  But the guy goes, here's my ticket.
[02:17:11.650 --> 02:17:12.431]  I was really there.
[02:17:12.431 --> 02:17:13.672]  And then he tells the official story.
[02:17:14.173 --> 02:17:15.194]  And the other guy does it.
[02:17:15.194 --> 02:17:17.755]  So it looks like, yes, and the government loves you.
[02:17:17.755 --> 02:17:19.116]  Brought to you by Doritos.
[02:17:19.116 --> 02:17:20.177]  Brought to you by Pepsi.
[02:17:20.177 --> 02:17:23.158]  I mean, it's like product placement, propaganda placement.
[02:17:23.158 --> 02:17:24.379]  So that goes on.
[02:17:24.379 --> 02:17:29.282]  But then when you say no one was killed at Sandy Hook, no, no, no, they like killing kids.
[02:17:29.282 --> 02:17:32.624]  That was a holiday for the folks that did it.
[02:17:32.624 --> 02:17:37.707]  And you had people in the same camo pants and black shirt caught by local police, who they were then ordered to release.
[02:17:37.707 --> 02:17:42.290]  And they said, oh, that's a conspiracy theory, even though the video and the arrest is actually on record.
[02:17:42.970 --> 02:17:48.693]  So, yeah, there's the signs of them involved, but they're going to kill real people.
[02:17:48.693 --> 02:17:49.733]  They enjoy that.
[02:17:49.733 --> 02:17:52.014]  I mean, it's not just like they don't care.
[02:17:52.014 --> 02:17:52.995]  They're in this job.
[02:17:52.995 --> 02:17:55.656]  The favorite thing is to kill little kids.
[02:17:55.656 --> 02:17:58.037]  So, that's my bottom line there.
[02:17:58.037 --> 02:17:59.538]  Thank you, Derek.
[02:17:59.538 --> 02:18:03.299]  I mean, could they have actors, you know, with fake legs blown off?
[02:18:03.299 --> 02:18:10.303]  I've seen people with a leg chopped off before and a tourniquet got around it and they were in shock and turned white and just laid back.
[02:18:10.303 --> 02:18:10.763]  I mean, you can...
[02:18:12.697 --> 02:18:17.381]  You can have your legs blown off and if they're not sliced off clean, they'll stop bleeding on their own sometimes.
[02:18:17.381 --> 02:18:18.983]  But I don't want to get into it with people.
[02:18:18.983 --> 02:18:19.763]  Um, whatever.
[02:18:19.763 --> 02:18:22.005]  It's just they want, the media wants to go with that.
[02:18:22.005 --> 02:18:26.449]  They don't want to look at Tamerlan now coming out, was in the CIA and had aliases.
[02:18:26.449 --> 02:18:28.371]  That's, that's mainstream news confirmed.
[02:18:28.371 --> 02:18:29.612]  They didn't even hide those facts now.
[02:18:29.612 --> 02:18:30.573]  That broke today.
[02:18:30.573 --> 02:18:33.496]  They don't want you to know about the Senator saying there was prior knowledge.
[02:18:33.496 --> 02:18:34.697]  They don't want you talking about the drill.
[02:18:35.575 --> 02:18:37.377]  Which was used as a smoke screen.
[02:18:37.377 --> 02:18:43.822]  They want you to focus on, no one died, and it's all a 3D projection, you know, from the Black Pyramid.
[02:18:43.822 --> 02:18:45.723]  Let's talk to Jenny in California.
[02:18:45.723 --> 02:18:46.544]  We've got about a minute and a half.
[02:18:46.544 --> 02:18:47.645]  We're going to break with Lindsey Williams.
[02:18:47.645 --> 02:18:50.407]  Go ahead.
[02:18:50.407 --> 02:18:50.868]  Hello?
[02:18:50.868 --> 02:18:51.548]  Hey!
[02:18:51.548 --> 02:18:52.429]  Jenny, come on down.
[02:18:52.429 --> 02:18:53.710]  Welcome.
[02:18:53.710 --> 02:18:55.592]  I'm excited I finally got on.
[02:18:55.592 --> 02:19:00.696]  So, Alex, I actually just have a couple questions instead of any kind of comments.
[02:19:02.293 --> 02:19:08.675]  When you talk about the martial law, you always say, if it happened in Austin, you're not going to stay in your home.
[02:19:08.675 --> 02:19:12.417]  You're going to, you know, go out and still live your life.
[02:19:12.417 --> 02:19:22.521]  I live here in California and I've actually heard a couple events that may or may not happen and, you know, maybe my area might be closed down.
[02:19:22.521 --> 02:19:28.183]  So my question is, if I would not apply
[02:19:28.686 --> 02:19:32.812]  You know, go with what they do when they try to come to my house.
[02:19:32.812 --> 02:19:34.014]  What do you think they will do to me?
[02:19:34.014 --> 02:19:35.056]  Do you think they're going to...
[02:19:36.007 --> 02:19:38.949]  Put me in jail and make me the terrorist?
[02:19:38.949 --> 02:19:40.609]  That's what my question is.
[02:19:40.609 --> 02:19:51.375]  No, no, look, they're going to just keep staging this and get you used, just like they have the children locked down, get in a fetal position so the death count can be higher, duck and cover when the Russians A-bomb you.
[02:19:51.375 --> 02:19:56.818]  They always say, do what we say, go into a catatonic position when we tell you so they're in control.
[02:19:56.818 --> 02:19:58.038]  It's prisoner training.
[02:19:58.038 --> 02:20:01.580]  Okay, lock down everybody, hands up against the walls.
[02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:02.260]  That's the Nazis.
[02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:03.161]  Everybody up against the wall.
[02:20:04.093 --> 02:20:05.333]  This is prisoner training.
[02:20:05.333 --> 02:20:07.634]  TSA, all of it is, they admit it.
[02:20:07.634 --> 02:20:09.015]  They've written handbooks on it.
[02:20:09.015 --> 02:20:12.316]  But this is all control of the situation training.
[02:20:12.316 --> 02:20:13.516]  And that we're all suspects.
[02:20:13.516 --> 02:20:18.898]  And this cop, you know, that commented on InfoWars, said, hey, we've got to, everybody's a suspect.
[02:20:18.898 --> 02:20:20.919]  We had to have the women come out with their hands up.
[02:20:20.919 --> 02:20:25.960]  You know, who knows, maybe that blonde woman, you know, maybe the black lady is an accomplice, you know.
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:29.982]  Everyone's a suspect, but them, who have a history of staging it.
[02:20:29.982 --> 02:20:32.743]  I'm going to skip this network break, obviously, and go to Williams here in a moment.
[02:20:34.415 --> 02:20:39.697]  If there's martial law, I'm not planning to go out and offensively fight with people.
[02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:40.318]  What am I going to do?
[02:20:40.318 --> 02:20:42.339]  Go fight with poor cops?
[02:20:42.339 --> 02:20:45.160]  I mean, they're literally brainwashed clones.
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:47.621]  They might as well be the Tom Cruise character.
[02:20:47.621 --> 02:20:49.442]  I just want them to be free!
[02:20:49.442 --> 02:20:51.203]  It's ridiculous!
[02:20:51.203 --> 02:20:53.744]  I mean, no, no, I'm trying to stop a civil war.
[02:20:54.992 --> 02:21:07.543]  But once they start gun confiscations and burning down Patriots' homes and doing all this and they'll shut down communications during this, people are going to know, especially military folks, and they're not going to just wait for the cops to come to their house.
[02:21:07.543 --> 02:21:16.270]  Once the cops are committing these crimes, like redcoats, under the rule of common law and our Declaration of Independence, they're open season.
[02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:18.172]  And I've warned the police, the police know this,
[02:21:19.551 --> 02:21:22.513]  I mean, I've heard the local sergeant, Sgt.
[02:21:22.513 --> 02:21:24.635]  Sam, Sam Cox.
[02:21:24.635 --> 02:21:25.996]  I guess we can say we're friends.
[02:21:25.996 --> 02:21:27.757]  I've hung out with him a couple times.
[02:21:27.757 --> 02:21:31.260]  He's come by the office, but I heard him on the radio a few weeks ago.
[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:34.362]  He goes, if they try to take the guns, there's going to be a civil war.
[02:21:34.362 --> 02:21:36.364]  The collateral damage will be incredible.
[02:21:36.364 --> 02:21:37.485]  People aren't turning their guns in.
[02:21:37.485 --> 02:21:39.066]  He goes, and I'm not turning my guns in.
[02:21:39.066 --> 02:21:41.848]  And Larry Pratt's not turning his guns in, and none of us are.
[02:21:41.848 --> 02:21:47.092]  My point is, this is horrible, but you're in the wrong.
[02:21:47.092 --> 02:21:48.033]  Don't cross this line.
[02:21:49.932 --> 02:21:55.136]  And look, they're going to start it, and they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on us, so they can be the good guys and we'll be the terrorists.
[02:21:55.136 --> 02:21:56.617]  I've told you this.
[02:21:56.617 --> 02:21:59.099]  I mean, they're trying to connect me to the bombings now.
[02:21:59.099 --> 02:22:02.882]  I can read you the headlines where, you know, Alex Jones influenced bombers, blah, blah, blah.
[02:22:02.882 --> 02:22:04.483]  It's everywhere.
[02:22:04.483 --> 02:22:07.526]  And, you know, someday it'll be Alex Jones is arrested.
[02:22:07.526 --> 02:22:11.028]  And if they torture me hard enough, you know, electroshock and stuff, I won't even know who I am.
[02:22:11.028 --> 02:22:13.851]  They'll put me on sodium pentothal, roll me out,
[02:22:14.511 --> 02:22:17.733]  Do an hour-long taped interview until I finally say, I did it.
[02:22:17.733 --> 02:22:18.533]  Yeah, I did it.
[02:22:18.533 --> 02:22:24.316]  You know, they've got the younger brother of Tamerlan, who can't even talk, but they're in the news saying he admits he did it.
[02:22:24.316 --> 02:22:24.897]  He's guilty.
[02:22:24.897 --> 02:22:28.879]  I mean, that's the opposite of our free society.
[02:22:28.879 --> 02:22:30.700]  And they're all like, it's the Muslim threat.
[02:22:30.700 --> 02:22:32.501]  Why is our president behind a Muslim threat?
[02:22:32.501 --> 02:22:35.262]  Because they're radicalizing Muslims to wreck the Middle East.
[02:22:35.262 --> 02:22:37.163]  It's always a public plan.
[02:22:37.163 --> 02:22:38.704]  It's called the clash of civilizations.
[02:22:40.097 --> 02:22:42.559]  They want Shiite and Sunni killing each other.
[02:22:42.559 --> 02:22:43.900]  Syria's been a stable country.
[02:22:43.900 --> 02:22:45.161]  That's why they're overtaking it.
[02:22:45.161 --> 02:22:46.902]  Libya was a stable country.
[02:22:46.902 --> 02:22:49.925]  Certainly not a fan of Gaddafi, but compared to al-Qaeda, he was a good guy.
[02:22:49.925 --> 02:22:51.966]  They're overthrowing it all.
[02:22:51.966 --> 02:22:56.050]  So I want the police to know, you're not just going to come burn down all our houses.
[02:22:56.986 --> 02:23:00.448]  You engage in enough atrocities, people are going to fight back.
[02:23:00.448 --> 02:23:01.829]  And the globalists don't care.
[02:23:01.829 --> 02:23:04.171]  They'll just get more drones.
[02:23:04.171 --> 02:23:06.172]  You're seen as drones.
[02:23:06.172 --> 02:23:07.793]  You're seen as a clone.
[02:23:07.793 --> 02:23:10.935]  You are called a biological android by the globalists.
[02:23:10.935 --> 02:23:24.284]  I've read stuff where Bertrand Russell, in the 40s, was calling police and their minions programmable, that's what they call TV programming, like you're stupid, programmable human resources, biological androids.
[02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:29.321]  I mean, I don't like being called an android myself.
[02:23:29.321 --> 02:23:31.502]  I'm not an android, okay?
[02:23:31.502 --> 02:23:32.662]  I got free will.
[02:23:32.662 --> 02:23:33.242]  I can learn.
[02:23:33.242 --> 02:23:33.863]  I'm smart.
[02:23:33.863 --> 02:23:36.184]  And I'm just as good as you, New World Order.
[02:23:36.184 --> 02:23:37.584]  I'm just as smart as you.
[02:23:37.584 --> 02:23:40.265]  I just don't have a flavor.
[02:23:40.265 --> 02:23:42.106]  I don't have a taste to dominate people.
[02:23:43.723 --> 02:23:49.927]  I like to sit there and watch a movie with my wife and drink cold beer with a fat French Bulldog's head on my lap.
[02:23:49.927 --> 02:23:50.868]  I never get tired of that.
[02:23:50.868 --> 02:23:52.028]  I never get tired of gardening.
[02:23:52.028 --> 02:23:53.649]  I never get tired of hunting and shooting.
[02:23:53.649 --> 02:23:55.050]  I never get tired of hiking.
[02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:56.731]  I never get tired of seeing my family.
[02:23:56.731 --> 02:23:58.853]  I never get tired... and you think I'm a freak.
[02:23:58.853 --> 02:24:00.954]  Your textbooks say I'm a bad guy.
[02:24:00.954 --> 02:24:02.435]  Thank you, man, for the call.
[02:24:02.435 --> 02:24:04.176]  All this stuff about how the family's bad.
[02:24:04.176 --> 02:24:05.397]  No, you're bad.
[02:24:05.397 --> 02:24:08.459]  You're bad and you just want to abuse nice things.
[02:24:08.459 --> 02:24:09.740]  You want to screw up nice things.
[02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:10.320]  Come on in, crew.
[02:24:13.206 --> 02:24:23.255]  We have a short video clip of Adandi at the press conference showing him stand up and show his pictures before getting surrounded by the bald Secret Service agent.
[02:24:23.255 --> 02:24:27.239]  Alright, we'll have that video added or uploaded to YouTube and added to Adan Salazar's video.
[02:24:27.239 --> 02:24:29.561]  If you give it to Rabdu or any of the crew, that'd be good.
[02:24:29.561 --> 02:24:30.322]  Good job.
[02:24:30.322 --> 02:24:32.724]  We'll show that coming up.
[02:24:32.724 --> 02:24:36.648]  But absolutely, they do not like this information.
[02:24:38.652 --> 02:24:50.257]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[02:24:50.257 --> 02:25:03.483]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[02:25:03.483 --> 02:25:07.485]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[02:25:07.645 --> 02:25:08.346]  We're good to go.
[02:25:38.326 --> 02:25:41.729]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:25:41.729 --> 02:25:47.794]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:25:47.794 --> 02:25:51.677]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:26:37.785 --> 02:26:39.726]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:26:39.726 --> 02:26:42.148]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:26:42.148 --> 02:26:47.611]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:26:47.611 --> 02:26:51.653]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:26:51.653 --> 02:26:55.575]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:26:55.575 --> 02:26:56.976]  The fact is, you are.
[02:26:56.976 --> 02:26:57.997]  We all are.
[02:26:57.997 --> 02:27:00.318]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:27:00.618 --> 02:27:09.185]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[02:27:27.199 --> 02:27:41.565]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[02:27:41.565 --> 02:27:47.387]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body?
[02:27:47.387 --> 02:27:51.408]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:27:51.408 --> 02:27:54.250]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:27:55.470 --> 02:27:55.851]  We're good!
[02:28:13.129 --> 02:28:25.673]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful, in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.

[02:29:38.227 --> 02:29:42.989]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:29:42.989 --> 02:29:46.030]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:29:46.030 --> 02:29:54.334]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:29:54.978 --> 02:30:00.540]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:11.904]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[02:30:23.889 --> 02:30:27.992]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:30:27.992 --> 02:30:31.074]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[02:30:31.074 --> 02:30:34.757]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:30:34.757 --> 02:30:36.018]  Protect your immune system.
[02:30:36.018 --> 02:30:37.058]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:30:53.323 --> 02:30:56.546]  By the way, here's the info up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:30:56.546 --> 02:31:00.750]  Illegal immigrant testifies before Senate Judiciary Committee.
[02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:03.853]  Wants American Dream for her 11 million cohorts.
[02:31:03.853 --> 02:31:05.355]  But I can't go to Mexico.
[02:31:05.355 --> 02:31:08.578]  That's predominantly the majority of this group.
[02:31:08.578 --> 02:31:13.182]  I can't go there and then get a bunch of free stuff for myself.
[02:31:13.182 --> 02:31:15.204]  That's up at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:15.204 --> 02:31:16.685]  But then you look over here.
[02:31:17.686 --> 02:31:23.651]  At DrugsReport.com, Obama administration paying people to recruit folks onto food stamps.
[02:31:23.651 --> 02:31:25.173]  That's Washington Post.
[02:31:25.173 --> 02:31:28.576]  Fraud more than doubles in three years.
[02:31:28.576 --> 02:31:29.977]  That's CNS News.
[02:31:29.977 --> 02:31:34.421]  Report, IRS issued billions in improper tax refunds.
[02:31:34.421 --> 02:31:41.027]  Yeah, right here in Austin, one house got something like $89 million.
[02:31:41.027 --> 02:31:42.047]  They didn't get in trouble either.
[02:31:43.058 --> 02:31:45.460]  You know, it's kind of like the guy that I think sent the Ryerson.
[02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:47.702]  He probably was put up to it by him.
[02:31:47.702 --> 02:31:50.964]  If you look at the intel, then now he has to be let go.
[02:31:50.964 --> 02:31:53.166]  He said he was part of a secret army for Obama.
[02:31:53.166 --> 02:31:55.848]  It is an army of just lawlessness.
[02:31:55.848 --> 02:31:57.890]  Man, these people are sick.
[02:31:57.890 --> 02:32:00.972]  And the legal immigration is over the top, because here's the deal.
[02:32:00.972 --> 02:32:02.774]  Just like the supposed bomber patsies,
[02:32:04.523 --> 02:32:10.364]  We're headed to New York City to party and we're on all this welfare and elite tuitions paid for.
[02:32:10.364 --> 02:32:16.966]  Folks, when you're a citizen and you are seen as a libertarian or conservative, you don't get anything.
[02:32:16.966 --> 02:32:18.806]  All the doors are shut to you.
[02:32:18.806 --> 02:32:22.987]  Because you're seen as coming from a culture of guns and liberty.
[02:32:22.987 --> 02:32:29.729]  The globalists are bringing in foreigners, not to make them Americans, but because they come from countries where they're slaves, they'll play ball.
[02:32:31.050 --> 02:32:36.774]  And this is a sadistic takeover because the globalists have a score to settle with America.
[02:32:36.774 --> 02:32:39.095]  We're going to be leveled.
[02:32:39.095 --> 02:32:40.977]  Just remember that, folks.
[02:32:40.977 --> 02:32:42.438]  Lindsey Williams, we're almost out of time.
[02:32:42.438 --> 02:32:45.280]  I'm going to overdrive and get calls here.
[02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:51.664]  But the time we have right now, bottom line, they are trying to impoverish the world.
[02:32:51.664 --> 02:32:53.845]  And that's the stated plans of the globalists.
[02:32:53.845 --> 02:32:56.287]  It's the stated plans to get our pension funds and bank accounts.
[02:32:56.287 --> 02:32:59.049]  What do you got on the war front from your associate?
[02:32:59.049 --> 02:33:00.190]  You're saying a number of months.
[02:33:01.090 --> 02:33:09.755]  How long till they... because I know Congress is talking about lovingly taking over retirement accounts to safeguard them but also tax them.
[02:33:09.755 --> 02:33:10.816]  This is after tax money.
[02:33:10.816 --> 02:33:17.320]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:26.662]  Direct from Austin.
[02:34:26.662 --> 02:34:29.886]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:34:36.857 --> 02:34:41.699]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:34:41.699 --> 02:34:43.280]  You want answers?
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:44.820]  Well, so does he.
[02:34:44.820 --> 02:34:49.022]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:34:49.022 --> 02:34:53.104]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:35:04.179 --> 02:35:05.680]  Alright, we're into fourth hour and overdrive.
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:07.100]  I want to welcome the stations that follow us here.
[02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:08.061]  I used to do four hours.
[02:35:08.061 --> 02:35:09.842]  I went back to three because I do the nightly news.
[02:35:09.842 --> 02:35:10.682]  But I end up doing four.
[02:35:10.682 --> 02:35:12.983]  So I should have just said the show's always four hours.
[02:35:12.983 --> 02:35:15.364]  Because some stations quit carrying the fourth hour, which is a tragedy.
[02:35:15.364 --> 02:35:17.245]  And so did XM.
[02:35:18.982 --> 02:35:21.784]  So, uh, because I pointed out it wasn't live.
[02:35:21.784 --> 02:35:23.526]  They didn't know for years it wasn't live.
[02:35:23.526 --> 02:35:26.428]  But it's live a lot of the time now, and we're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:26.428 --> 02:35:28.589]  I gotta reset and recap.
[02:35:28.589 --> 02:35:30.411]  It's like living in a movie, having my life.
[02:35:30.411 --> 02:35:32.873]  And I don't say that in, like, an excited way.
[02:35:32.873 --> 02:35:36.736]  It's a big responsibility, and I'm just a regular guy, and I'm not up to all this.
[02:35:36.736 --> 02:35:38.237]  But I try to be as moral as I can.
[02:35:38.237 --> 02:35:42.040]  I try to be the best person I can.
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:44.842]  And also, at the same time, try to pay our way to fight the globalists.
[02:35:47.193 --> 02:35:51.276]  You know, so we can fund ourselves without being under globalist funding or control.
[02:35:51.276 --> 02:35:52.917]  There's just so much going on in this world.
[02:35:52.917 --> 02:35:53.858]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:35:53.858 --> 02:35:55.599]  I'm going to recap the top stories.
[02:35:55.599 --> 02:35:59.021]  Some big breaking news that is just epic.
[02:35:59.021 --> 02:36:07.447]  The big brother on record documents released in Georgia training under a CIA program, which we already knew.
[02:36:07.447 --> 02:36:09.589]  It's like never ending.
[02:36:09.589 --> 02:36:11.490]  Why did it have to be the government again?
[02:36:11.490 --> 02:36:15.573]  It's so creepy to see all those Boston cops involved in it as well.
[02:36:16.795 --> 02:36:20.457]  I mean, and I'm not saying they're involved doing it, but like going along with it.
[02:36:20.457 --> 02:36:25.099]  I mean, it's... And they grabbed that guy and cut his larynx out immediately.
[02:36:25.099 --> 02:36:27.320]  They wanted him dead, but the media had the live feed of it.
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:29.361]  It's just horrible.
[02:36:29.361 --> 02:36:30.721]  But, I mean, that's what they do all day long.
[02:36:30.721 --> 02:36:36.004]  I mean, they'll cluster bomb Iraqis and make jokes about it and watch the videos back at base like it's fun.
[02:36:36.004 --> 02:36:37.705]  You see, you have empathy for a reason, folks.
[02:36:37.705 --> 02:36:39.525]  It's all going to come back on us.
[02:36:39.525 --> 02:36:43.487]  Jordan in Missouri, a Saudi national suspect, here on the air.
[02:36:43.487 --> 02:36:44.288]  That's the point you want to raise?
[02:36:44.288 --> 02:36:44.788]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:36:45.741 --> 02:36:47.782]  Yeah, Alex, it's good to talk to you, man.
[02:36:47.782 --> 02:36:50.043]  I salute you and your team for what you do.
[02:36:50.043 --> 02:36:51.243]  You put your lives on the line.
[02:36:51.243 --> 02:36:55.305]  I appreciate it, and so does everyone else, and I've been waking up a lot of people about this stuff.
[02:36:55.305 --> 02:37:03.029]  But anyways, I wanted to ask you about that Saudi national, because I don't know if you've seen it, but Glenn Beck was on YouTube saying, oh, I give Obama till Monday till...
[02:37:04.369 --> 02:37:05.751]  He loves suckering people.
[02:37:05.751 --> 02:37:08.115]  He's a nasty... I'm not gonna... I'll take it back.
[02:37:20.970 --> 02:37:31.453]  He knows there's FEMA camps, the legislation, the bills, the civilian inmate labor camp guys pull up a re-education camp army manual, army.mil, show it to viewers.
[02:37:31.453 --> 02:37:33.533]  I'll give people the FM number.
[02:37:33.533 --> 02:37:34.894]  And he knows all that and builds it up.
[02:37:34.894 --> 02:37:35.434]  It's real!
[02:37:35.434 --> 02:37:40.555]  I'm going to expose it in one month and then makes fun of everybody and says it isn't real and shows the straw man.
[02:37:40.555 --> 02:37:47.397]  And I said, he'll come out and admit this guy's on a terror watch list, or his family was, in Saudi Arabia and that the White House covered it up.
[02:37:47.397 --> 02:37:49.078]  That was all already in the news.
[02:37:49.978 --> 02:37:52.879]  And it's just like, talk about over-promising, under-delivering.
[02:37:52.879 --> 02:37:55.921]  We are the opposite here, which is actually a problem I have.
[02:37:55.921 --> 02:38:00.143]  I need to learn how to build stuff up, because we under-promise, over-deliver.
[02:38:02.089 --> 02:38:04.751]  I mean, we have these guys are CIA.
[02:38:04.751 --> 02:38:06.672]  We have them as set up patsies.
[02:38:06.672 --> 02:38:14.796]  The only way that it isn't a staged inside job, and it's one in a thousand, is that they were triple agents and double-crossed.
[02:38:14.796 --> 02:38:16.597]  You see, they were CIA.
[02:38:16.597 --> 02:38:23.961]  They were used to infiltrate Muslim mosques and stuff, which is the perfect cover.
[02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:24.902]  The perfect cover.
[02:38:26.038 --> 02:38:29.902]  To have somebody talking about how they're going to blow stuff up so that they look like a terrorist later.
[02:38:29.902 --> 02:38:35.167]  It's like they had McVeigh spying on militias going around talking about terror everywhere.
[02:38:35.167 --> 02:38:48.420]  That way when they actually blew something up and blamed him as a patsy, and he was there by the way, part of the operation, part of the sting he thought, then they would be able to say, see he walked around saying he was a terrorist at all these gun shows and things.
[02:38:52.219 --> 02:38:54.401]  A little bit tired today for whatever reason.
[02:38:54.401 --> 02:38:55.582]  It's a bit late, got up so early.
[02:38:55.582 --> 02:38:57.283]  I'm just so sick of it all.
[02:38:57.283 --> 02:38:59.405]  It makes my head hurt.
[02:38:59.405 --> 02:39:09.652]  It makes my head hurt to have the articles up at InfoWars.com right now, where the Russian news and the Georgian news is reporting
[02:39:10.718 --> 02:39:13.181]  Uh, and now the police state measures of the Kentucky Derby.
[02:39:13.181 --> 02:39:13.862]  God.
[02:39:13.862 --> 02:39:15.524]  Now you can't take your own chair or a cooler.
[02:39:15.524 --> 02:39:17.186]  You gotta buy it all there.
[02:39:17.186 --> 02:39:19.909]  Yeah, just wreck, wreck it all, cause somebody might bring a bomb in.
[02:39:19.909 --> 02:39:20.750]  Oh my God.
[02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:25.115]  Why don't people say, hey, we're really Boston strong, Boston brave.
[02:39:25.115 --> 02:39:27.258]  We're not gonna check any of the backpacks.
[02:39:27.258 --> 02:39:27.638]  You know what?
[02:39:27.638 --> 02:39:29.641]  Your terrorism doesn't affect us.
[02:39:29.641 --> 02:39:30.281]  No, it's the opposite.
[02:39:32.762 --> 02:39:34.002]  Start life over.
[02:39:34.002 --> 02:39:36.063]  Spend more quality time with your family.
[02:39:36.063 --> 02:39:37.543]  Take more vacations.
[02:39:37.543 --> 02:39:38.823]  Own your own business.
[02:39:38.823 --> 02:39:42.564]  Be healthy and earn the kind of income you've always dreamed of.
[02:39:42.564 --> 02:39:43.644]  Is it possible?
[02:39:43.644 --> 02:39:44.224]  Yes!
[02:39:44.224 --> 02:39:45.464]  With Young-Jevity.

[02:39:56.987 --> 02:39:58.107]  And guess who will be there?
[02:39:58.467 --> 02:40:04.351]  Hi, I'm Dr. Joel Wallach, the Dead Doctors Don't Lie guy, and I prescribe the Healthy Body Challenge, and I'll be there.
[02:40:04.351 --> 02:40:08.694]  Hi, this is pharmacist Ben Phoenix, and I'm taking the Healthy Body Challenge, and I will be there.
[02:40:08.694 --> 02:40:14.598]  Hi, I'm Dr. Peter Glidden, I'm doing the Healthy Body Challenge, and I'll see you at the Longevity Conference in May.
[02:40:14.958 --> 02:40:21.001]  Take the Healthy Body Challenge and don't miss the Longevity Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada, May 2nd through 4th.
[02:40:21.001 --> 02:40:24.723]  For more information, go to InfoWarsTeam.com.

[02:40:33.464 --> 02:40:39.466]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[02:40:39.466 --> 02:40:41.287]  That's closer than you think.
[02:40:41.287 --> 02:40:47.469]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[02:40:47.469 --> 02:40:56.213]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[02:40:56.213 --> 02:41:01.755]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[02:41:02.495 --> 02:41:03.876]  But here's some good news.
[02:41:03.876 --> 02:41:13.359]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[02:41:13.359 --> 02:41:22.623]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[02:41:22.623 --> 02:41:26.825]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[02:41:26.825 --> 02:41:28.325]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[02:41:31.434 --> 02:41:32.635]  Are you an inventor?

[02:42:03.339 --> 02:42:09.402]  Even if you only have an idea for improving an existing product and don't know where to go with it, you'll want this free inventor's information.
[02:42:17.646 --> 02:42:23.009]  It shows how Inventel may assist you in trying to patent your invention and submit it to industry.
[02:42:23.009 --> 02:42:23.989]  It's a free call.
[02:42:23.989 --> 02:42:24.310]  That's 1-800-977-6119.
[02:42:24.310 --> 02:42:24.410]  1-800-977-6119.
[02:42:24.410 --> 02:42:26.911]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:26.911 --> 02:42:28.212]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:42:56.442 --> 02:43:02.746]  We're usually recording CNN, Fox, and a bunch of others when there's breaking news, and I believe we were taping.
[02:43:02.746 --> 02:43:04.888]  I was almost late getting back in here in studio.
[02:43:04.888 --> 02:43:07.630]  It's 208 Central time on this Wednesday edition.
[02:43:07.630 --> 02:43:08.750]  I was almost late.
[02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:15.175]  Mischa, the foggy guy overseas that says Tamerlan and his brother, the two brothers,
[02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:22.612]  We're Alex Jones listeners, and it's all because of Alex Jones, the shadowy influence.
[02:43:22.612 --> 02:43:26.634]  They're now admitting no one can find him and there's no proof.
[02:43:26.634 --> 02:43:28.515]  Is Misha at Lanley, Virginia?
[02:43:28.515 --> 02:43:31.076]  Is that where Misha is?
[02:43:31.076 --> 02:43:34.197]  I mean, I'm on air here, folks, and they've got a senator.
[02:43:34.197 --> 02:43:36.358]  Will you guys queue up the senator clip?
[02:43:36.358 --> 02:43:42.220]  They've got a senator coming out, Chambliss,
[02:43:44.898 --> 02:43:46.138]  Oh, my headset just fell off.
[02:43:46.138 --> 02:43:47.939]  I got in here so quick.
[02:43:47.939 --> 02:43:49.479]  It's like rocket science, the tape back there.
[02:43:49.479 --> 02:43:52.860]  We had a big meeting, and how many people does it take to get a thing recorded?
[02:43:52.860 --> 02:43:56.001]  But, you know, when DVRs are running, you can always back them back out.
[02:43:56.001 --> 02:43:56.961]  Yeah, who is Misha?
[02:43:56.961 --> 02:44:01.103]  And that's Tamerlan's friend, had strong religious beliefs.
[02:44:01.103 --> 02:44:04.584]  That's who did it, and they're on their admitting they can't find Misha.
[02:44:04.584 --> 02:44:12.766]  Maybe, maybe, maybe Misha... Maybe Misha is the same guy
[02:44:14.773 --> 02:44:23.800]  Who was involved in having the drill, hmm?
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:27.663]  Maybe Mischa, maybe Mischa's behind everything.
[02:44:27.663 --> 02:44:32.066]  So, this is really getting hard to deal with at this point.
[02:44:34.554 --> 02:44:40.219]  Chambliss, a law enforcement agency, may have had info about bombing, Boston bombing in advance.
[02:44:40.219 --> 02:44:44.643]  Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss told Channel 2 Action News.
[02:44:45.802 --> 02:44:52.026]  Last night, that the law enforcement agency may have had information in advance of the Boston bombings that wasn't properly shared.
[02:44:52.026 --> 02:44:53.267]  Oh, gee, think so?
[02:44:53.267 --> 02:44:59.971]  And now it's come out in the Russian news, in mainline news, Boston bombers roll the CIA in Chechen terror.
[02:44:59.971 --> 02:45:07.836]  And Islamic terror from Caucus' next phase and plan to undermine liberty, part of the Jamestown's Abigny Brzezinski group.
[02:45:07.836 --> 02:45:13.280]  And then they have the Secret Service running around, telling us... Do we have the clip of Chambliss?
[02:45:14.366 --> 02:45:15.027]  Okay, good.
[02:45:15.027 --> 02:45:22.094]  Then we have the Secret Service running around, coming up to our reporters saying, don't hand out photos, don't talk to the press.
[02:45:22.094 --> 02:45:24.716]  That video's up on Infowars.com now.
[02:45:24.716 --> 02:45:25.857]  And photos of it.
[02:45:25.857 --> 02:45:28.020]  I mean, they are scared to death.
[02:45:28.020 --> 02:45:33.425]  And I mean, I'm just sitting here watching all this happen in front of me and it's just completely blowing me away.
[02:45:33.425 --> 02:45:36.048]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip of the Senator and then back to your phone calls.
[02:45:36.838 --> 02:45:47.524]  Senator Saxby Chambliss told Channel 2 Action News within the past hour that a law enforcement agency may have had information in advance of the Boston bombings, information that was not properly shared.
[02:45:47.524 --> 02:45:50.045]  First, bringing you up to date on the investigation.
[02:45:50.045 --> 02:45:54.988]  Tonight, two officials say that Tamerlan Sarniav liked to look at extremist websites.
[02:45:54.988 --> 02:45:57.530]  He died in a violent getaway at 10th last week.
[02:45:57.530 --> 02:45:59.291]  His younger brother remains in the hospital.
[02:45:59.291 --> 02:46:01.332]  Today, we found out that he is in fair condition.
[02:46:01.912 --> 02:46:06.556]  And Senator Chambliss talked to us about the information that was not shared with law enforcement.
[02:46:06.556 --> 02:46:10.619]  He wouldn't elaborate on the agency or what the information was.
[02:46:10.619 --> 02:46:21.668]  There now appears that there may have been some evidence that was obtained by one of the law enforcement agencies that did not get shared in a way that it should have been.
[02:46:21.668 --> 02:46:26.872]  If that turns out to be the case, then we have to determine whether or not that would have made a difference.
[02:46:27.964 --> 02:46:31.709]  New today, we learned 50 people are still in the hospital in the Boston area.
[02:46:31.709 --> 02:46:33.991]  Some of them are now without limbs.
[02:46:33.991 --> 02:46:36.715]  Uh-huh.
[02:46:36.715 --> 02:46:37.996]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:46:37.996 --> 02:46:40.860]  Again, the article is up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:46:45.157 --> 02:46:50.120]  Right now, we have the headline, Tamerlan attended CIA-sponsored workshop.
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:51.961]  He had aliases.
[02:46:51.961 --> 02:46:53.402]  He had it all.
[02:46:53.402 --> 02:46:56.764]  And Kurt Nemo's been adding to that article since it broke.
[02:46:56.764 --> 02:46:58.125]  We'd add the whole history of it.
[02:46:58.125 --> 02:47:02.548]  The head of the MI6, you know, the head of the bombing on 7-7 was MI6.
[02:47:02.548 --> 02:47:06.951]  It just goes on and on and on and on.
[02:47:10.034 --> 02:47:11.856]  That story needs to get out to everybody.
[02:47:11.856 --> 02:47:18.442]  Because, you know, we tend to put out one article about something about, oh, look, he had an alias they let him use, which shows he was an intelligence operative.
[02:47:18.442 --> 02:47:21.124]  Hey, look, the Russians inquired about him to blow his cover.
[02:47:21.124 --> 02:47:30.492]  Hey, look, now he's hanging out at his Zbigniew Brzezinski CIA training system to infiltrate and kick the Russians out of different countries.
[02:47:30.492 --> 02:47:32.174]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:47:32.174 --> 02:47:34.816]  And they're not there to kick the Russians out to bring freedom.
[02:47:34.816 --> 02:47:36.097]  They're there to put an al-Qaeda
[02:47:36.798 --> 02:47:41.440]  To then turn the place into a Stone Age hellhole, like Libya and Syria.
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:43.701]  I mean, so immoral!
[02:47:43.701 --> 02:47:46.423]  But they want to do that to America, too.
[02:47:46.423 --> 02:47:49.564]  They're wrecking America.
[02:47:49.564 --> 02:47:50.765]  And then using the threat.
[02:47:50.765 --> 02:47:56.047]  American Free Press, UK Bilderberg 2013 meeting confirmed.
[02:47:56.047 --> 02:47:57.908]  That makes me think it might not be confirmed.
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:01.941]  Because it's been all over the map, you know, thinking it was in the U.S.
[02:48:01.941 --> 02:48:03.521]  and stuff, but I know they put out this info.
[02:48:03.521 --> 02:48:05.082]  Good job of them getting that.
[02:48:05.082 --> 02:48:07.543]  Watson has, uh, thinks he confirmed it about a month ago.
[02:48:07.543 --> 02:48:10.544]  Or I guess three weeks ago.
[02:48:10.544 --> 02:48:21.628]  So, um... There's the AFP podcast where they're talking about it, so... But it, it, look, it, it looks like that is the case, so...
[02:48:23.143 --> 02:48:24.164]  AFP Mark Anderson.
[02:48:24.164 --> 02:48:27.446]  Hey, get Mark Anderson on, guys, the next few days for a quick pop-in.
[02:48:27.446 --> 02:48:28.767]  We've got Mark's number on the computer.
[02:48:28.767 --> 02:48:31.689]  At least we did a hundred times ago.
[02:48:31.689 --> 02:48:33.410]  But we need to get Mark Anderson on.
[02:48:33.410 --> 02:48:37.012]  American Free Press, UK Bilderberg 2013 meeting confirmed.
[02:48:37.012 --> 02:48:40.975]  And it's an InfoWars.com story.
[02:48:40.975 --> 02:48:47.339]  And he got an email from a Grove employee apparently confirming UK-based Bilderberg meeting this coming June, Anderson writes.
[02:48:47.339 --> 02:48:50.541]  An email reply to AFP from the Grove staffer and
[02:48:51.764 --> 02:48:53.205]  A check with the hotel website.
[02:48:53.205 --> 02:48:55.065]  Yeah, we've actually been by there.
[02:48:55.065 --> 02:48:58.506]  A calendar confirmed the hotel is booked solid June 5th to the 9th.
[02:48:58.506 --> 02:49:05.349]  The Bilderberg meeting itself, by all the latest indications, is to take place June 6th to the 9th.
[02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:12.191]  This updates the recent AFP report that stated England was likely general meeting location, but the meeting would be held June 9th to the 11th.
[02:49:12.191 --> 02:49:15.172]  At the time, the hotel where the meeting was to be held was not yet known.
[02:49:18.968 --> 02:49:27.475]  We should probably just, not that I care, but just for accuracy, we should probably add that it was InfoWars.com that confirmed it was England.
[02:49:27.475 --> 02:49:29.316]  Just watch this.
[02:49:29.316 --> 02:49:33.059]  InfoWars.com.
[02:49:33.059 --> 02:49:42.987]  Bilderberg, Bilderberg in England.
[02:49:42.987 --> 02:49:45.209]  And there's the story.
[02:49:45.209 --> 02:49:45.649]  April 13th.
[02:49:48.818 --> 02:49:52.723]  Confed's set to take place in Watford, UK.
[02:49:52.723 --> 02:49:53.805]  Paul Joseph Watson's.
[02:49:53.805 --> 02:49:54.726]  I guess it was two weeks ago.
[02:49:55.828 --> 02:49:58.509]  I think he had one before that, too.
[02:49:58.509 --> 02:50:01.349]  I don't care.
[02:50:01.349 --> 02:50:02.009]  It's a great article.
[02:50:02.009 --> 02:50:03.430]  Our InfoWars guy wrote.
[02:50:03.430 --> 02:50:05.030]  I'm happy to promote what Anderson's doing.
[02:50:05.030 --> 02:50:05.610]  He's a good guy.
[02:50:05.610 --> 02:50:06.991]  I hope to have him on this year.
[02:50:06.991 --> 02:50:09.251]  If I don't go, I'll have him on regardless.
[02:50:09.251 --> 02:50:11.592]  I'll be sending somebody.
[02:50:11.592 --> 02:50:13.432]  I kind of like to hide out in the shadows, though.
[02:50:13.432 --> 02:50:16.193]  I don't like being a rock star, I'll be honest with you.
[02:50:16.193 --> 02:50:18.834]  It's pretty amazing when I go to these things, what happens with the press.
[02:50:20.854 --> 02:50:25.398]  It's like, you know, I like hot dogs, but I don't want to go to a hot dog eating contest and eat a hundred of them, you know what I mean?
[02:50:25.398 --> 02:50:38.588]  It's just kind of like I've... Will you guys have this article added to the one that's on InfoWars so people can actually see photos of the facility and the rest of it?
[02:50:38.588 --> 02:50:41.951]  And I believe, yeah, we got the date right whenever we reported it.
[02:50:41.951 --> 02:50:46.734]  Let me see if that's the same thing that American Free Press has got on their deal.
[02:50:47.677 --> 02:50:49.018]  Yeah, they got 6th and 9th too.
[02:50:49.018 --> 02:50:50.380]  Okay, that's enough of me.
[02:50:50.380 --> 02:50:52.041]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:50:52.041 --> 02:50:53.482]  Clint in Kentucky!
[02:50:53.482 --> 02:50:56.045]  Hey, you don't have due process anymore.
[02:50:56.045 --> 02:50:57.927]  They said they can stop and frisk anybody they want.
[02:50:57.927 --> 02:51:00.389]  There's the terrorist in Kentucky.
[02:51:00.389 --> 02:51:01.710]  Land of the free, home of the brave, huh?
[02:51:02.991 --> 02:51:03.772]  No, not anymore.
[02:51:03.772 --> 02:51:08.517]  I was going to say, man, I was on hold yesterday when you had to close the show out.
[02:51:08.517 --> 02:51:11.160]  I really wanted to talk to you yesterday because I could hear the disgust.
[02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:12.862]  I could hear the anger in your voice.
[02:51:12.862 --> 02:51:20.711]  And I wanted to let you know that not only am I praying for you, for your safety, your strength, and your patience, but I want to ask that all your listeners say a prayer for you.
[02:51:21.863 --> 02:51:24.065]  You're really out there doing a good thing and we need to know.
[02:51:24.065 --> 02:51:32.610]  Well I get mad because it's like watching somebody cram their hand in a garbage disposal and turn it on and even when their hand's chopped up saying, no my hand's not chopped up.
[02:51:32.610 --> 02:51:34.731]  I mean this new rule of order is bad.
[02:51:34.731 --> 02:51:37.933]  And it's just, it is painful to watch it metastasize.
[02:51:37.933 --> 02:51:38.874]  Go ahead.
[02:51:38.874 --> 02:51:39.894]  It is.
[02:51:39.894 --> 02:51:48.620]  The Saudi National, I don't want to get into the exact same things that y'all have been, but wasn't it, didn't Obama stop in his name and Michelle Obama stop in his name, correct?
[02:51:50.053 --> 02:51:51.835]  Yes, they acted very, very suspicious.
[02:51:51.835 --> 02:51:53.296]  Here's what I want to say.
[02:51:53.296 --> 02:51:54.857]  And now they found one of them dead in the lake.
[02:51:54.857 --> 02:51:55.978]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:51:55.978 --> 02:52:01.241]  Yeah, Mr. President, I'm paying your salary, so I would really like to know what you were doing on the clock, stopping in.
[02:52:01.241 --> 02:52:04.144]  I want to know what the meeting was about, because I pay your salary.
[02:52:04.144 --> 02:52:10.928]  And I think if we push it enough, we may not be able to get the answer that we want, but at least we'll heat them up and not have to give us some kind of answer.
[02:52:10.928 --> 02:52:12.209]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:52:12.209 --> 02:52:13.971]  Why do you think the Secret Service
[02:52:15.236 --> 02:52:24.139]  Would go to a meeting that Obama and no other cabinet people are at and get in the face of a reporter that was going to bring up a drill?
[02:52:24.139 --> 02:52:24.960]  Well, I'll tell you exactly why.
[02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:27.901]  Because I used to be on the other side of the fence.
[02:52:27.901 --> 02:52:31.042]  I used to be the one not making the right choices.
[02:52:31.042 --> 02:52:33.523]  When you flip like that, it's because you know you're in the wrong.
[02:52:33.523 --> 02:52:37.445]  And the only way to stop the person on the right is to intimidate them.
[02:52:37.445 --> 02:52:38.245]  And that's it.
[02:52:38.245 --> 02:52:41.066]  I mean, if you use intimidation, if that doesn't work,
[02:52:41.730 --> 02:52:44.552]  You really get scared because most of the time those people aren't tough.
[02:52:44.552 --> 02:52:45.993]  That's why they need numbers.
[02:52:45.993 --> 02:52:47.634]  They're not tough.
[02:52:47.634 --> 02:52:50.877]  They don't know what real war is about.
[02:52:50.877 --> 02:52:53.899]  So, intimidation doesn't work.
[02:52:54.571 --> 02:52:57.994]  Basically we pushed them in a corner and they're in a bad shape.
[02:52:57.994 --> 02:53:00.976]  Well no, they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on us, that's what they do.
[02:53:00.976 --> 02:53:04.039]  They were going to blame the Tea Party, it didn't work.
[02:53:04.039 --> 02:53:08.603]  And so now they fell back to Muslims, who they probably actually had plant the bombs.
[02:53:08.603 --> 02:53:12.326]  They were CIA, definitely the older brother, that's confirmed now.
[02:53:12.326 --> 02:53:15.809]  All of the math, he was one of their minions, not an agent.
[02:53:15.809 --> 02:53:17.310]  Or quote, officer as they call them.
[02:53:19.358 --> 02:53:23.683]  But they tried to then say, well a foggy guy, here's his first name.
[02:53:23.683 --> 02:53:26.345]  He says Alex Jones made him do it.
[02:53:26.345 --> 02:53:27.747]  And then now they're on CNN.
[02:53:27.747 --> 02:53:33.413]  Imagine walking by in the coffee room and they're talking about, what's the name?
[02:53:33.413 --> 02:53:35.575]  I don't have the AP article in front of me.
[02:53:35.575 --> 02:53:39.559]  Chamis, Chamis, how do you say it?
[02:53:39.559 --> 02:53:39.659]  Huh?
[02:53:42.028 --> 02:53:43.549]  Yeah, Chambliss.
[02:53:43.549 --> 02:53:44.770]  And they've got it on screen.
[02:53:44.770 --> 02:53:45.690]  I've got the article right here.
[02:53:45.690 --> 02:53:46.851]  Let me find it.
[02:53:46.851 --> 02:53:50.894]  Yeah, Chambliss says Alex Jones.
[02:53:50.894 --> 02:53:51.474]  InfoWars.
[02:53:51.474 --> 02:53:53.636]  I mean, come on, man.
[02:53:53.636 --> 02:53:56.238]  I expose them so they write me into it?
[02:53:56.238 --> 02:54:01.741]  What, are you going to find a cooker bomb at my house next, you jackasses?
[02:54:01.741 --> 02:54:03.642]  Let's skip this network break.
[02:54:03.642 --> 02:54:05.023]  Let's talk to PJ in...
[02:54:06.570 --> 02:54:10.612]  Boston on the Boston bombing and insider trading.
[02:54:10.612 --> 02:54:14.393]  Ooh, it's always important to look at insider trading because they always do that when it's staged.
[02:54:14.393 --> 02:54:15.733]  I forgot to look at that telltale sign.
[02:54:15.733 --> 02:54:19.495]  We should create a checklist for people for false flags.
[02:54:19.495 --> 02:54:21.236]  Do they work for intelligence agencies?
[02:54:21.236 --> 02:54:22.496]  Was there a drill?
[02:54:22.496 --> 02:54:24.477]  Did law enforcement be told to stand down?
[02:54:24.477 --> 02:54:26.237]  All that's coming out.
[02:54:26.237 --> 02:54:28.138]  You know, did they have aliases?
[02:54:28.138 --> 02:54:29.679]  Did they try to kill the Patsy's?
[02:54:30.814 --> 02:54:39.397]  Maybe they can have Jack Ruby walk up to the other brother, you know, who's had his larynx cut out, and just have him go... And then they can kill Jack Ruby, too, you know?
[02:54:39.397 --> 02:54:45.839]  Or maybe zombie Jack Ruby, like... Get rid of Patsy!
[02:54:45.839 --> 02:54:48.720]  I mean, how dumb do you have to be, people?
[02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:49.160]  I'm sorry.
[02:54:51.568 --> 02:54:56.650]  And this is not a Tetris effect here, where you play Tetris long enough that, you know, it's called the Tetris Syndrome.
[02:54:56.650 --> 02:54:58.471]  Everything looks like Tetris.
[02:54:58.471 --> 02:55:00.712]  It's not, I'm a hammer, everything's a nail.
[02:55:00.712 --> 02:55:04.773]  Believe me, I don't want this to be an inside job.
[02:55:04.773 --> 02:55:08.855]  It just happens to be that, and now I'm being connected to it.
[02:55:08.855 --> 02:55:11.256]  I told you they were going to try to blame us for it.
[02:55:11.256 --> 02:55:12.777]  It's so funny.
[02:55:12.777 --> 02:55:14.217]  Oh, it's not funny, though.
[02:55:14.217 --> 02:55:15.638]  I'm sorry, PJ, finish your point.
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:22.282]  Alright, so, um, back in 2012 they signed into law the Stock Act.
[02:55:22.282 --> 02:55:28.104]  Um, it basically shows Congress and how they're doing inside trading.
[02:55:28.104 --> 02:55:31.486]  It's supposed to disclose their information, financial information.
[02:55:31.486 --> 02:55:41.790]  But, when the Boston bombing happened, at the same time Obama signed into law the Stock Act, S-T-O-C-K Act rollback.
[02:55:42.461 --> 02:55:42.881]  No, no, no.
[02:55:42.881 --> 02:55:43.342]  Don't look into things.
[02:55:43.342 --> 02:55:43.802]  That's extreme.
[02:55:43.802 --> 02:55:44.683]  Sir, the government loves you.
[02:55:44.683 --> 02:55:45.664]  Have you had your shots today?
[02:56:07.228 --> 02:56:13.334]  Alex, I'm going to every program, every, uh, golden program, and every single server is delayed.
[02:56:13.334 --> 02:56:18.359]  All of them, 10 ounce, 100 ounce, 1 ounce, it doesn't matter what it is, golden server, they're all delayed.
[02:56:18.359 --> 02:56:19.781]  I'm trying to get one right now.
[02:56:19.781 --> 02:56:20.782]  They're all delayed.
[02:56:20.782 --> 02:56:22.363]  They're all sold out.
[02:56:23.921 --> 02:56:26.844]  I don't know if Midas Resources is sold out of gold.
[02:56:26.844 --> 02:56:28.246]  No, no.
[02:56:28.246 --> 02:56:35.013]  Since the price went down, the globalists are using that to buy it, and that's what I've been told, is that gold actually sells their way up.
[02:56:35.013 --> 02:56:38.517]  Because people just are actually understanding they used a paper market to drive it down.
[02:56:38.517 --> 02:56:41.160]  I haven't sold any gold or silver I had.
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:41.860]  Thank you so much.
[02:56:41.860 --> 02:56:42.421]  Great points, PJ.
[02:56:44.793 --> 02:56:51.857]  By the way, Steve Washington did a report, it's actually a serious report, alerts Spider-Man linked with Boston Bombers.
[02:56:51.857 --> 02:56:55.979]  Michael Jackson, Game of Thrones, Finding Nemo could also be involved.
[02:56:55.979 --> 02:57:00.301]  Because that was on their Facebook and other social media accounts.
[02:57:00.301 --> 02:57:05.604]  And since some foggy guy said they listened to me, it's my fault.
[02:57:05.604 --> 02:57:09.606]  So by extension, it's Spider-Man.
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:11.740]  Alert!
[02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:16.662]  Spider-Man linked with Boston Bombers, Michael Jackson, Game of Thrones, Finding Nemo could also be involved.
[02:57:16.662 --> 02:57:17.882]  Obviously.
[02:57:17.882 --> 02:57:18.743]  You know that fish.
[02:57:18.743 --> 02:57:21.704]  Man, that fish acts friendly.
[02:57:21.704 --> 02:57:24.204]  You know, the American people are like the fish that can't remember anything.
[02:57:24.204 --> 02:57:28.366]  Like, you know, like it knows Nemo and she's always like, who are you again?
[02:57:28.366 --> 02:57:29.326]  Dory.
[02:57:29.326 --> 02:57:34.348]  Yeah, it's like, I'm like, uh, that's, now the First Amendment says we have the right to religion and the government has no jurisdiction.
[02:57:34.348 --> 02:57:36.209]  Who are you again?
[02:57:36.209 --> 02:57:40.170]  Like that, Dory should be the new American mascot.
[02:57:43.052 --> 02:57:48.185]  You're kidding, they're coming out with a single called Finding Dory?
[02:57:48.185 --> 02:57:48.907]  Wow.
[02:57:48.907 --> 02:57:51.032]  While she gets lost?
[02:57:51.032 --> 02:57:51.493]  Oh, okay.
[02:57:52.997 --> 02:57:54.298]  That is a good movie.
[02:57:54.298 --> 02:57:59.421]  I'm telling you right now, folks, we've thought, is it the ostrich is the new American symbol?
[02:57:59.421 --> 02:58:02.123]  Is it a TSA officer shoving their hand up your rump?
[02:58:02.123 --> 02:58:04.425]  No, no, no.
[02:58:04.425 --> 02:58:06.246]  We need something more family-friendly.
[02:58:06.246 --> 02:58:13.390]  Dory will be the new national symbol, and everyone will forget the American flag ever existed, and that will be the new flag.
[02:58:13.390 --> 02:58:16.152]  But they won't even know what that is with all the fluoride.
[02:58:16.152 --> 02:58:18.594]  Is that not genius?
[02:58:18.594 --> 02:58:20.335]  The new American flag will be Dory.
[02:58:20.335 --> 02:58:21.656]  For people that don't know, can we pull up Dory?
[02:58:23.224 --> 02:58:29.688]  Um... I love the sharks in that movie.
[02:58:29.688 --> 02:58:31.590]  It's like, hello there, friend!
[02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:33.551]  Yeah, the big smile.
[02:58:33.551 --> 02:58:34.411]  Uh, let's go ahead.
[02:58:34.411 --> 02:58:35.212]  Oh, there you go.
[02:58:35.212 --> 02:58:37.293]  There's Dory the blue fish.
[02:58:37.293 --> 02:58:38.854]  Of course, you can't remember that.
[02:58:38.854 --> 02:58:39.475]  Like, what is that?
[02:58:39.475 --> 02:58:40.876]  Is that a fish?
[02:58:40.876 --> 02:58:43.577]  Someday, if you even know that something's a fish, you'll be like a genius.
[02:58:43.577 --> 02:58:45.098]  Like, that man is a genius.
[02:58:45.098 --> 02:58:45.639]  He has an IQ of 52.
[02:58:45.639 --> 02:58:46.219]  He's able to breathe.
[02:58:50.546 --> 02:58:57.010]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Colorado, shutting down the Missile Defense Base, whatever that is.
[02:58:57.010 --> 02:58:58.511]  What's a Missile Defense Base?
[02:58:58.511 --> 02:58:59.311]  Hello, who's the caller?
[02:58:59.311 --> 02:59:00.212]  Who did I say I was going to?
[02:59:00.212 --> 02:59:00.552]  Hello?
[02:59:00.552 --> 02:59:00.852]  Hello?
[02:59:00.852 --> 02:59:02.333]  I love my government.
[02:59:02.333 --> 02:59:03.674]  I love my Obama.
[02:59:03.674 --> 02:59:05.755]  I love my free medical care, though it's not free.
[02:59:05.755 --> 02:59:06.495]  Hello?
[02:59:06.495 --> 02:59:06.855]  Hello?
[02:59:06.855 --> 02:59:08.336]  He said he wouldn't raise my taxes.
[02:59:08.336 --> 02:59:09.097]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:59:09.097 --> 02:59:10.097]  What's your name?
[02:59:10.097 --> 02:59:11.198]  Hey Alex, John.
[02:59:11.198 --> 02:59:11.578]  Who?
[02:59:11.578 --> 02:59:11.958]  Who are you?
[02:59:11.958 --> 02:59:12.799]  What?
[02:59:12.799 --> 02:59:14.220]  John.
[02:59:14.220 --> 02:59:15.680]  I'm sorry, I don't remember your name.
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:16.161]  What is it again?
[02:59:18.473 --> 02:59:21.075]  Okay, well you're being a conspiracy theorist telling me you know how to talk.
[02:59:21.075 --> 02:59:21.355]  Go ahead.
[02:59:21.355 --> 02:59:23.797]  No, I'm not.
[02:59:23.797 --> 02:59:29.001]  Hey, I have a friend of the family who's been working out at Buckley Air Force Base for 40 years.
[02:59:29.001 --> 02:59:31.182]  His father worked there, now his son works there.
[02:59:31.182 --> 02:59:34.084]  Works for a private defense contractor.
[02:59:34.084 --> 02:59:46.333]  They were told about a month, a month and a half ago, that Buckley Air Force Base, if you're not familiar with it, the huge golf balls when you fly into Denver International Airport, but they provide all the missile warning, missile defense, technology,
[02:59:47.219 --> 02:59:56.583]  All that basically Homeland Security stuff, but they were told that the division that runs the whole thing was told that they were going to shut down within the next two months.
[02:59:56.583 --> 02:59:58.963]  The mother was absolutely outraged.
[02:59:58.963 --> 03:00:08.487]  The father said that the father had worked there for 35 years, so the United States will have absolutely no security whatsoever once this is closed down.
[03:00:08.487 --> 03:00:11.788]  I mean, I searched Buckley Air Force Base to close.
[03:00:11.788 --> 03:00:16.090]  It seems like I heard something about that, but has that not been announced yet?
[03:00:17.159 --> 03:00:30.510]  There's 92,000 people that work out there, so this is just the particular division that runs the satellite warning early missile defense system.
[03:00:30.510 --> 03:00:36.955]  And, like I said, the father, without going into any detail, said we will have absolutely no defense warnings whatsoever.
[03:00:38.069 --> 03:00:40.110]  Well, he also might be compartmentalized.
[03:00:40.110 --> 03:00:43.112]  They've launched a bunch of floating ones.
[03:00:43.112 --> 03:00:51.876]  I mean, I was down at Corpus Christi a few years ago and watched this giant one launch, took photos of it, and then a year later saw it in National Geographic talking about the launch of it.
[03:00:51.876 --> 03:00:58.800]  But yeah, I saw some deal where they were saying they were going to not have missile defense as part of a deal with China on the West Coast.
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:03.222]  So of course, look, a government with nukes, with missiles, is not a threat.
[03:01:03.222 --> 03:01:04.963]  The threat is the veterans and gun owners.
[03:01:05.823 --> 03:01:06.564]  And fathers.
[03:01:06.564 --> 03:01:07.604]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:01:07.604 --> 03:01:12.107]  May the force stay with us, protecting Buckley Air Force Base from closure.
[03:01:12.107 --> 03:01:14.929]  There's the Aurora Sentinel reporting on that.
[03:01:14.929 --> 03:01:20.332]  And, uh... And it says they are shutting parts of it down, so there you go.
[03:01:20.332 --> 03:01:22.834]  Well, sir, we need the Army to spy on Tea Partiers.
[03:01:22.834 --> 03:01:26.636]  I mean, did you not hear that it's all my fault the bombing's down?
[03:01:26.636 --> 03:01:29.978]  It's gone from, I say we should look at the government, and they go, oh, really, Jones?
[03:01:29.978 --> 03:01:33.200]  You did it!
[03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:33.861]  What do you think of that?
[03:01:35.862 --> 03:01:38.084]  I don't know, it's just I'm so powerful right now.
[03:01:38.084 --> 03:01:41.547]  Hey, quick question or quick comment about the Boston thing.
[03:01:41.547 --> 03:01:50.674]  I don't know if you saw this this morning, but it came out that the public defender is going to be the same public defender that defended the shoe bomber.
[03:01:50.674 --> 03:01:56.118]  And that he also admitted to the crime before his read as Miranda rights.
[03:01:58.255 --> 03:01:59.516]  Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah, no.
[03:01:59.516 --> 03:02:02.437]  They're coming out with a guy they chopped the throat out of right after he was fined.
[03:02:02.437 --> 03:02:03.038]  They're like, I'm fine.
[03:02:03.038 --> 03:02:03.538]  They're like, oh, really?
[03:02:03.538 --> 03:02:04.699]  You're not fine now?
[03:02:04.699 --> 03:02:06.440]  Box cutters.
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:07.580]  And we'll take care of you, pal.
[03:02:07.580 --> 03:02:09.501]  And now he admits he's guilty.
[03:02:09.501 --> 03:02:10.742]  Well, you know why they're so desperate?
[03:02:10.742 --> 03:02:12.963]  Because it was an intelligence operation.
[03:02:12.963 --> 03:02:13.504]  Did you hear me?
[03:02:13.504 --> 03:02:17.526]  That it's come out that Tamerlan was in a CIA program and he had aliases?
[03:02:17.526 --> 03:02:19.327]  This is confirmed about the alias stuff.
[03:02:19.963 --> 03:02:22.144]  I mean, they definitely set this up.
[03:02:22.144 --> 03:02:24.986]  Yeah, a shoe bomber lawyer to represent the Boston bombing suspect.
[03:02:24.986 --> 03:02:31.209]  The shoe bomber had an IQ of about 60 and tried a light plastic explosive.
[03:02:31.209 --> 03:02:35.811]  They're saying that she's excellent, tough, and tenacious and why she'd be one of the best defense lawyers that a man could give.
[03:02:38.407 --> 03:02:39.408]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:02:39.408 --> 03:02:42.490]  Well, if they ever set me up, that's not the one I want.
[03:02:42.490 --> 03:02:47.874]  It's like, it's like this great white shark is really protects you from sharks in the water.
[03:02:47.874 --> 03:02:50.756]  Now, stick your legs in its mouth.
[03:02:50.756 --> 03:02:53.738]  It'll take good care of you.
[03:02:53.738 --> 03:02:54.798]  Kangaroo courts, man.
[03:02:54.798 --> 03:02:55.159]  All right.
[03:02:55.159 --> 03:02:55.519]  Thank you.
[03:02:55.519 --> 03:02:55.999]  Yeah.
[03:02:55.999 --> 03:02:56.800]  John brought that up.
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:02:58.121]  We were able to confirm everything he said.
[03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:00.161]  I'm out of time.
[03:03:00.161 --> 03:03:04.824]  I apologize to Alicia, Chris, Farouk, and Mike.

[03:04:04.406 --> 03:04:06.909]  We're trying to do an ad system to have ads on it, but it hasn't worked yet.
[03:04:06.909 --> 03:04:09.551]  It's where we can pay to give you the daytime show at least free.
[03:04:09.551 --> 03:04:11.573]  Uh, because we want to reach more people.
[03:04:11.573 --> 03:04:12.133]  That's the goal.
