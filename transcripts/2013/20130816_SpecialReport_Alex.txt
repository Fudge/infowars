[00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.712]  Have you ever really considered your home's wireless security?
[00:00:14.393 --> 00:00:19.277]  How many devices do you have with wireless signals and radio frequencies going through your house?
[00:00:20.177 --> 00:00:27.783]  It's creepy enough that the government is spying on you, but imagine going into your toddler's room and hearing a man's voice cursing.
[00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:33.768]  One Houston family's baby monitor was hacked by a man who not only cursed at the child, but the parents too.
[00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:36.550]  And he had complete control of the camera.
[00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.011]  It felt like somebody broke into our house.
[00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:40.093]  He said, uh, wake up, Allison, you little ****.
[00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:46.775]  The baby monitor is on a fixed signal, and as long as it's on, it can be hacked, just like all other monitoring devices.
[00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:56.518]  Miss Teen USA, Cassidy Wolfe, has recently had her webcam hacked, and has been threatened by her hacker, as he's saying he's going to post nude photos of her if he doesn't get a certain amount of money.
[00:00:57.038 --> 00:01:00.039]  If you're in a smart home, you're living a hacker's dream.
[00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:07.984]  They can hack into your alarm system, your garage doors, your water, your lights, and even your air conditioning, among other things.
[00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:15.650]  We've reported on TVs and cable boxes spying on people, but add in the baby monitor and factor in that cars can be hacked too.
[00:01:21.654 --> 00:01:27.078]  Go straight from... So turn the car off and on.
[00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:27.539]  Okay.
[00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.061]  So we just tricked the pre-collision system into thinking something very odd was happening, right?
[00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:34.924]  Because I was telling the car we're going 199 and it was like, should I brake?
[00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:36.065]  Should I tighten the seatbelts?
[00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:36.546]  What should I do?
[00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.327]  It went from like 200 to one mile an hour.
[00:01:38.527 --> 00:01:40.008]  It's like, I just ran into a brick wall.
[00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:40.589]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:41.670]  I ran into a brick wall.
[00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.532]  And what you have is the terror threat of the future.
[00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:48.215]  Cyber security should be as important as your Second Amendment right.
[00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:49.736]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:51.738]  The government has it totally under control.
[00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:59.404]  At the industrial complex, the military industrial complex, they store all your data so they can keep tabs on you and make sure that you don't get out of line.
[00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:01.426]  No reason to be concerned, though.
[00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:02.727]  You trust your government, right?
[00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:09.372]  Just make sure that that creepy voice that's coming through your toddler's monitor isn't the voice of the IRS or the NSA.
[00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:29.933]  And when that hacker hacks into your alarm system, make sure that it's not the FBI, CIA, or even your local police because they might actually have one of those 30,000 domestic drones that they purchased pointed at you ready to use it as you try to break into your own home because they've hacked into your cell phone.
[00:02:30.814 --> 00:02:34.736]  Check out these two books, When Disaster Strikes and When Technology Fails.
