[00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.690]  GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
[00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:15.085]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:16.526]  You want answers?
[00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:18.207]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:22.530]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.113]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:54.706]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have had my amazing crew working until late last night, Jakari Jackson, David Knight, Rob Dew, the amazing crew in here, Chris Alanese and the rest of the crew, to bring you the information that we are going to be breaking down here today.
[00:00:55.811 --> 00:01:12.543]  We're going to analyze a Bloomberg gun confiscation rally, and just analyze the lies, the fraud, and show the mainstream media covering up the rally, saying that once they register our guns, they're going to confiscate them.
[00:01:12.903 --> 00:01:13.824]  Because that's the blueprint.
[00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:18.687]  We've got them handing out the fake signs that the news then claims are grassroots.
[00:01:19.187 --> 00:01:21.728]  They point at the signs and say, look, it's grassroots.
[00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:31.952]  Once you know the formula, the man behind the curtain, it's so creepy that we've got a city councilman that looks like the Hispanic version of Dr. Evil.
[00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:34.313]  I mean, Mike Martinez.
[00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:42.149]  Another one of these guys that, you know, is a city union head, Capitol Metro, light rail, scalping the citizens.
[00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.170]  And he says, listen, you guys got a sign out there saying don't ban the guns?
[00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:49.571]  Well, guess what?
[00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:53.553]  We're not banning them today, but what we're doing today will let us get that done.
[00:01:53.593 --> 00:01:55.354]  So that sign, you'll need that soon.
[00:01:56.034 --> 00:01:58.075]  And this is a guy who hangs around with Bloomberg.
[00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:00.836]  The Austin police chief was up there with Biden on TV.
[00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:06.961]  I mean, he's like one of the main sellout police chiefs, because most of the sellout police chiefs can't even hardly talk.
[00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:10.956]  They just sit up there and, you know, get more obese and collect their paychecks.
[00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:17.041]  Art Acevedo is a slick guy, brought up by the feds out of California, federalizing LA.
[00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:19.643]  He's one of their inside operatives.
[00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:24.787]  And now he's taking over Austin and trying to shut down the gun shows, everything.
[00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:31.011]  And then he comes over and confronts our cameras and says we're making stuff up, nobody wants to confiscate guns.
[00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:33.653]  Hey Acevedo, we got you, okay?
[00:02:33.673 --> 00:02:35.655]  And you say you want to come in studio?
[00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:36.476]  I can't wait.
[00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:47.332]  Let's go ahead and play, though, Mike Martinez, the Bloomberg frontman, Mayor Pro Tem, uh, you know, saying, hey, buddy, to a guy, you gotta sign about banning guns?
[00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:59.197]  By the way, they were muscling him, cussing at him and bumping into him while he was there, and the police didn't go over, we have video of this, to the guys getting in his face, cussing at him and bumping him, the pro-gun guy.
[00:03:00.878 --> 00:03:03.780]  They go over and muscle on him with a sign.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.320]  That's America!
[00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:06.361]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:03:14.587 --> 00:03:16.468]  Thank you so much.
[00:03:16.588 --> 00:03:29.690]  I've got a proclamation on the African American City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.652]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[00:03:42.817 --> 00:03:52.302]  So because of the work we're doing here today, we will make that sign legitimate shortly.
[00:03:52.322 --> 00:03:59.506]  We're going to come back with my full report on that in the next segment because I show clips of where they admit the plan is a total gun ban.
[00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:00.547]  Of course it is!
[00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:08.031]  Chicago, New York, every other country the globalists control, they armed to the teeth, paramilitary police, surveillance helicopters, drones,
[00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:14.736]  Just total pre-crime, domestic, tattletale brigades.
[00:04:14.836 --> 00:04:16.197]  I mean, direct scripting of 1984.
[00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:19.279]  But as long as you call it liberal...
[00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:21.217]  It's A-OK.
[00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:34.707]  Now the legislature of New York is calling for, and it's already happening, but they're calling for anyone who's ever been on any type of antidepressant drug period, which they basically force the military on, will have your guns taken.
[00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:38.530]  That's linked up in the middle column under a Ken Wiener rise again.
[00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.372]  Police confiscating firearms from people taking anti-anxiety medication.
[00:04:42.853 --> 00:04:44.014]  And then Time Magazine
[00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:47.575]  Warning others about government oppression is anti-American crap.
[00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:49.635]  I thought it was the essence of America.
[00:04:49.676 --> 00:04:53.036]  And so I thought I'd dovetail that with all the real government oppression.
[00:04:53.337 --> 00:05:03.259]  And then we've got Jakari Jackson in studio along with David Knight with their amazing footage analyzing a victim disarmament tyrant Bloomberg rally.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.800]  Analyzing the enemy.
[00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:14.731]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:18.473]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:22.876]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:27.880]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[00:07:06.284 --> 00:07:08.185]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:10.146]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:07:10.386 --> 00:07:15.888]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:19.869]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.911]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:25.272]  The fact is, you are.
[00:07:25.452 --> 00:07:26.232]  We all are.
[00:07:26.492 --> 00:07:28.813]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:37.475]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[00:07:49.497 --> 00:07:55.378]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:56.278]  We're good to go.
[00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:52.984]  Throughout history, there have been many cases where authoritarians take the restraint of the armed population as weakness instead of restraint.
[00:08:53.604 --> 00:09:03.547]  Especially by the real warrior class in this country, not the fake warrior class that likes to oppress men, women, and children like North Korean soldiers.
[00:09:04.468 --> 00:09:15.519]  And the globalists are trying to convert America over to a system where the supposed warrior class does not protect the peace and defend the republic, but instead ushers in the enslavement of the people.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:24.609]  And by any historical yardstick, they had a major university study last year showing the United States the sixth worst police state in the world.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:35.332]  Though the United States has a paradox because there's still so many time-honored basic liberties and freedoms that were hard won by the founders of this country and our veterans and others since then.
[00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:41.499]  There's always good and evil, there's always the control freaks, there's always the usurpers trying to take over.
[00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:45.902]  Just because they're always trying to take over because they live off our tax money.
[00:09:46.162 --> 00:09:49.606]  They live off the monopolies that they can create for big business.
[00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:52.689]  Just because they're always pushing, you don't give up.
[00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:56.293]  That's the eternal fight that every generation goes through.
[00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:00.998]  And this is going to be an unprecedented broadcast today.
[00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:02.920]  It is a very important broadcast.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.601]  We're going to be focusing on the Second Amendment.
[00:10:05.307 --> 00:10:12.995]  Because the second wave since Obama's re-election of the attempt to butcher the Second Amendment is on right now.
[00:10:13.976 --> 00:10:26.069]  We are at a razor-thin margin in the Senate with them being able to pass national gun registration, shutting down private sales, felonies if you give your son or daughter a gun or they give you a gun.
[00:10:27.341 --> 00:10:35.245]  All sorts of harassment, the ATF being able to shut down gun shops and factories via color of law.
[00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:47.452]  The enemy is coming in with their greatest assault ever and will probably provocateur or stage another mass shooting very, very soon.
[00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:57.763]  In one of the victim disarmament zones that they've created where no one can protect themselves and the children are trained to get in a fetal position to be executed to help the shooter get the maximum death rate.
[00:10:58.643 --> 00:11:03.685]  While the SWAT team stands down outside so the mercenary group can exfiltrate out the back.
[00:11:04.426 --> 00:11:07.607]  Even if you catch them exfiltrating, it's in the video of it.
[00:11:07.627 --> 00:11:14.310]  Or even if the Department of Defense is running the shooter in Colorado.
[00:11:16.062 --> 00:11:20.743]  The general public just cannot get how criminal this operation is we're facing.
[00:11:20.983 --> 00:11:24.284]  This is a foreign banking takeover of America.
[00:11:24.844 --> 00:11:36.287]  And if you capture the United States completely, you've got all the drones, all the weapons, all the troops, all the aircraft carriers, all the cruise missiles, the new cruise missiles.
[00:11:36.627 --> 00:11:38.627]  The ICBMs are basically worthless, folks.
[00:11:39.127 --> 00:11:41.428]  The new cruise missiles that are the ultimate weapon.
[00:11:42.358 --> 00:11:43.718]  In the arsenal on the record.
[00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:46.999]  I mean, we are the big enchilada.
[00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:57.102]  And they've got lots of collaborators, lots of arrogant, egomaniac yes-men that are ready to shell out and they really think they can win a protracted war.
[00:11:57.362 --> 00:11:59.603]  They really think you're going to roll over and turn your guns in.
[00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:24.415]  Or they can just do like New York and 15 other states have done, start banning semi-autos, banning high-capacity mags, and then SWAT teaming and persecuting gun owners, veterans, setting up checkpoints on highways, and doing knock-and-talks to catch gun owners with guns they haven't turned in, to then fill the horrible private prisons with the patriots of America.
[00:12:24.636 --> 00:12:25.316]  It's not going to work.
[00:12:25.817 --> 00:12:26.838]  Let me tell you what's going to happen.
[00:12:27.717 --> 00:12:30.419]  Okay, and it's already happening, and they know this.
[00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:33.361]  You're going to have cops dead all over the place.
[00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:34.762]  It's already happening.
[00:12:35.663 --> 00:12:38.545]  You're going to have cops with people that are fed up when you try to take their guns.
[00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.428]  People aren't just going to wait anymore in their house for you to come get the guns.
[00:12:43.209 --> 00:12:43.529]  Okay?
[00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:45.190]  These are combat-trained people.
[00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:45.971]  Everybody knows it.
[00:12:47.031 --> 00:12:48.632]  Okay, and it's going to start a civil war.
[00:12:48.853 --> 00:12:49.713]  And that's the plan.
[00:12:50.054 --> 00:12:51.054]  That's the false flag.
[00:12:52.155 --> 00:12:56.279]  And look, we've got now over a thousand sheriffs coming out and saying it's tyranny, it's evil.
[00:12:56.439 --> 00:13:02.184]  So they introduced a bill that the Secret Service will have law enforcement power in the state of Colorado.
[00:13:02.224 --> 00:13:04.926]  They've introduced it in other states to arrest sheriffs.
[00:13:05.626 --> 00:13:07.008]  That's civil war right there.
[00:13:07.648 --> 00:13:08.849]  But it's not even a civil war.
[00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:12.011]  The federal government has been taken over by foreign banks.
[00:13:12.531 --> 00:13:14.673]  The sheriffs in some of the states realize that.
[00:13:15.053 --> 00:13:24.860]  That's why you've got judges in Texas, state judges, county judges, coming out and saying they're setting up martial law, they're preparing a takeover, a civil war, before Obama got re-elected.
[00:13:25.641 --> 00:13:28.483]  If you're not getting chills, you don't have a heartbeat out there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.525]  So all of this is going on.
[00:13:31.785 --> 00:13:32.906]  All of this is happening.
[00:13:33.917 --> 00:13:34.958]  And look at these headlines.
[00:13:34.978 --> 00:13:36.239]  I want to show TV viewers this.
[00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:38.661]  Radio listeners, go to Infowars.com.
[00:13:39.102 --> 00:13:45.087]  Time columnist warning others about government oppression is anti-American crap.
[00:13:45.488 --> 00:13:46.088]  That's a quote.
[00:13:46.328 --> 00:13:47.289]  There is no oppression.
[00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:48.290]  There is no tyranny.
[00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:55.277]  Of course, they now admit TSA on the streets, warrantless wiretapping, the police state, the persecution of patriots.
[00:13:56.613 --> 00:14:02.958]  But see, they're scared of talking about the two billion bullets, the armored vehicles, or the fact that, well, you want our guns while you're arming to the teeth?
[00:14:03.238 --> 00:14:04.519]  That's the elephant in the room.
[00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:05.900]  That's why they're selling...
[00:14:07.752 --> 00:14:12.635]  30 plus guns on the instant check registration system a minute.
[00:14:13.295 --> 00:14:16.757]  That's why they're having 70 million guns bought every two years now on record.
[00:14:16.937 --> 00:14:17.858]  It's more like 100 million.
[00:14:18.118 --> 00:14:19.419]  Because it's over, folks.
[00:14:19.739 --> 00:14:20.499]  Don't you get it?
[00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:24.362]  This isn't Russia with a bunch of poor peasants that never had freedom under the czars.
[00:14:24.902 --> 00:14:27.884]  And then a bunch of commies come in and take over and just have a slaughterhouse.
[00:14:28.624 --> 00:14:32.528]  Not that the Russians aren't tough people, but they were always under bondage, so they never had a leg up.
[00:14:32.768 --> 00:14:34.049]  This is not Nazi Germany.
[00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:37.212]  We're sure the Germans were tough and smart, but they were subservient.
[00:14:37.692 --> 00:14:39.514]  It's a German thing to do what you're told.
[00:14:39.934 --> 00:14:40.615]  To get in line.
[00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:43.569]  This is not Nazi Germany.
[00:14:43.609 --> 00:14:47.350]  This is not the Chinese peasants who've been under 5,000 years of tyranny.
[00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.730]  Strong, smart people, but always enslaved.
[00:14:50.031 --> 00:14:51.691]  This is America.
[00:14:51.931 --> 00:14:53.071]  This is the Republic.
[00:14:53.111 --> 00:14:55.512]  And you haven't chopped all of our huevos off.
[00:14:55.752 --> 00:14:57.892]  You haven't destroyed this country completely yet.
[00:14:58.212 --> 00:15:01.813]  There's over 100 million people who know who you are.
[00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:05.514]  This isn't just a republic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:05.794 --> 00:15:09.494]  This is Sparta, if you want to use the 300 analogy.
[00:15:09.614 --> 00:15:09.995]  But it's not 300.
[00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:10.575]  It's hundreds.
[00:15:13.061 --> 00:15:23.449]  Of thousands in every state who are sitting back watching what's happening and everything's being confirmed for them and they are locked and they are loaded!
[00:15:23.809 --> 00:15:26.491]  And I want to tell the Federal Reserve and the New World Order something.
[00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:28.573]  You are not going to get away with this.
[00:15:28.853 --> 00:15:33.556]  You may be able to kill Ron Paul or kill Alex Jones and wipe out the leadership.
[00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:36.739]  And the reason you haven't done that yet is because you know what that'll do.
[00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:38.160]  That'll energize us 110%.
[00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:41.251]  Okay?
[00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:45.533]  We're powering up against your revolution against our republic.
[00:15:45.953 --> 00:15:47.013]  We're energizing!
[00:15:47.053 --> 00:15:47.893]  We're rising!
[00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:49.674]  That's why you desperately went for the guns.
[00:15:49.894 --> 00:15:51.054]  It's why you staged Aurora.
[00:15:51.214 --> 00:15:52.495]  It's why you staged Sandy Hook.
[00:15:52.855 --> 00:15:53.895]  It's your Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:15:55.276 --> 00:16:00.617]  You think you're going to get away with this just because you've got space planes with DU SABOs?
[00:16:00.817 --> 00:16:02.218]  Just because you've got cruise missiles?
[00:16:02.558 --> 00:16:04.939]  All that stuff is worthless against a population.
[00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:08.460]  Brzezinski's bemoaned at your top tactician.
[00:16:09.847 --> 00:16:11.667]  You are designed to take down states.
[00:16:11.687 --> 00:16:13.448]  You're not designed to take down ideas.
[00:16:13.668 --> 00:16:14.928]  You've tried to take men down.
[00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:16.548]  You've tried to balkanize America.
[00:16:16.748 --> 00:16:23.310]  If you watch MSNBC, that is New World Order, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, above the White House, it's panic zone.
[00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.050]  Everybody fight racially!
[00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.070]  Attack white people!
[00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.931]  So blacks go out and attack whites all over the country.
[00:16:28.111 --> 00:16:28.951]  Then they cover that up.
[00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:33.732]  But then they want whites scared to create division at the same time as well.
[00:16:34.412 --> 00:16:39.418]  They are hitting the panic button, ladies and gentlemen, for racial division, religious division.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.641]  But listen, listen!
[00:16:42.762 --> 00:16:48.369]  That's why they're going after the guns right now, ladies and gentlemen, as a counter-offensive, because our offensive's winning.
[00:16:50.131 --> 00:16:53.474]  The Big Red One is rolling right into Germany, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:55.797]  Battle of the Bulge.
[00:16:55.897 --> 00:16:57.098]  Oh, is that 1943, 1944?
[00:16:57.439 --> 00:17:01.483]  They're rolling in and they're throwing everything they've got to stop us.
[00:17:01.723 --> 00:17:03.104]  They're already done.
[00:17:03.465 --> 00:17:06.388]  Their only hope is to convince you that you've lost.
[00:17:06.768 --> 00:17:07.669]  We have won!
[00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:16.256]  I know intellectually, I know historically, I know politically, I know with my street smarts, my whole life God's been training me.
[00:17:16.276 --> 00:17:18.759]  I wonder why all this horrible stuff happened to me growing up.
[00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:21.341]  My whole life was preparation for this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:21.761 --> 00:17:23.462]  Your whole life was preparation for this.
[00:17:25.264 --> 00:17:26.745]  And we're not buying into this.
[00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:33.491]  We see it, we know it, we understand it, we know where it's going, and we know the enemy.
[00:17:34.793 --> 00:17:36.334]  We know the enemy.
[00:17:36.434 --> 00:17:37.575]  We know the enemy.
[00:17:38.175 --> 00:17:39.796]  And they are a bunch of slime bags.
[00:17:39.956 --> 00:17:41.517]  They're not coming to take our guns.
[00:17:41.697 --> 00:17:43.198]  They're trying to steal our guns.
[00:17:43.578 --> 00:17:47.741]  They're not admitting they want our guns, except in their own internal manuals, when they slip up.
[00:17:48.982 --> 00:17:51.283]  They're coming to steal our guns.
[00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:58.528]  Mike Martinez, involved with the Bloomberg group, the Austin police chief, high level now in the Obama administration.
[00:18:00.131 --> 00:18:12.434]  So slick that I told people privately here, Arne Seveda, I said that that guy's history in helping him take over major police departments in LA, I believe that guy's probably deep cover fed.
[00:18:13.715 --> 00:18:15.915]  And if he's got the nerve to come in here, I'll talk to him.
[00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:24.798]  And now he's up there, not just with the other police chiefs, he's up there with Biden, he's up there with Obama, up there because he's a good salesman going, we don't want your guns!
[00:18:26.098 --> 00:18:30.703]  All we want is to register them, and to let, if a psychiatrist says, without any due process, take your guns.
[00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:34.726]  And then Martinez gets up and says, you see that guy with a sign over there?
[00:18:35.575 --> 00:18:39.598]  Who was silently standing there, so the people were like bumping into him and cussing at him.
[00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:43.181]  We're going to play the video up close of this, with the cuss words beeped out.
[00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:51.027]  Then the police came over and got in on the Americans, on the citizens, who were just there holding up their signs, silently saying, no gun ban.
[00:18:51.408 --> 00:18:56.332]  And Martinez says, hey, you that's dying for attention, implying they were causing the disturbance.
[00:18:57.253 --> 00:19:02.716]  While the police try to violate their First Amendment with pure, in their little costumes, in their little Captain Hook outfits.
[00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:05.178]  We're supposed to, why don't you wear gold crowns, we bow down to you.
[00:19:05.798 --> 00:19:08.020]  And he says, we're going to play this when we come back, the whole report.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.482]  He points at him and he says, we're not taking your guns today.
[00:19:13.623 --> 00:19:16.925]  But he goes, what we're doing today, we will then get your guns.
[00:19:16.985 --> 00:19:19.967]  I'll make that sign legitimate, so you keep that sign, you're going to need it.
[00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:21.531]  I mean, that's it.
[00:19:22.772 --> 00:19:24.333]  It's not just that they want to enslave us.
[00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:26.754]  They're not going to enemy army landing saying we're here.
[00:19:27.414 --> 00:19:34.918]  No, it's like Cicero said, the Roman philosopher and historian, the enemy inside that doesn't come with a banner openly unfurled is the plague.
[00:19:36.819 --> 00:19:46.384]  And I mean, I've been around these people and I've seen them and they're crazed with the criminal energy.
[00:19:46.424 --> 00:19:48.585]  That's what it is to try to steal our Second Amendment and lie about it.
[00:19:48.985 --> 00:19:50.186]  With the criminal energy.
[00:19:51.394 --> 00:19:59.868]  And that's what I, that's what makes me just like a dog when it sees a threat, just arrr, just like, just instinctively because it's that energy, it's that, it's that evil energy.
[00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.852]  It's an evil energy.
[00:20:02.593 --> 00:20:03.635]  They are empowered with it.
[00:20:03.855 --> 00:20:04.716]  Rise against them!
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:18.842]  For those who know the benefits of silver, for those who know the healing history of silver, and for those who want to be prepared, now there's SilverGauze, a nylon elastic wrap with silver bonded to each individual fiber.

[00:20:35.678 --> 00:20:36.759]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:41.302]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:41.502 --> 00:20:47.206]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:47.306 --> 00:20:50.708]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:50.948 --> 00:20:53.550]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.573]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:21:05.838 --> 00:21:10.842]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[00:21:11.002 --> 00:21:14.124]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[00:21:14.504 --> 00:21:20.508]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[00:21:20.628 --> 00:21:32.576]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:37.239]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[00:21:37.439 --> 00:21:39.020]  And they're so easy to use.
[00:21:39.241 --> 00:21:41.142]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[00:21:41.162 --> 00:21:44.884]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[00:21:45.165 --> 00:21:47.006]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.

[00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:55.815]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[00:22:05.828 --> 00:22:08.690]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:12.293]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:15.215]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?

[00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:39.436]  Stop and think how much money you could save by simply reducing buying bottled water and using water filtered by your Berkey water filter.
[00:22:39.596 --> 00:22:42.398]  No need to be constantly replacing expensive filters with a Berkey.
[00:22:42.498 --> 00:22:44.861]  A single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.

[00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:07.243]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:23:07.263 --> 00:23:09.225]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:23:09.425 --> 00:23:15.649]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:18.872]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:23:19.132 --> 00:23:22.854]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:23:23.015 --> 00:23:24.195]  The fact is, you are.
[00:23:24.396 --> 00:23:25.176]  We all are.
[00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:27.758]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:23:28.038 --> 00:23:36.343]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[00:23:54.395 --> 00:23:58.316]  No, they want to divide us and demonize our liberties as if they're tyrannies.
[00:24:21.641 --> 00:24:28.745]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's the report on Mike Martinez, Austin City Council person, minion of Bloomberg, with the police chief.
[00:24:30.626 --> 00:24:32.887]  And what you're seeing is treason against this republic.
[00:24:32.947 --> 00:24:37.049]  It is sedition, whether he knows it or not, and he shows his inner knowledge of.
[00:24:37.329 --> 00:24:39.370]  We're going to get you registered, then we're going to confiscate.
[00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.230]  Here's the report.
[00:24:40.811 --> 00:24:43.252]  Austin City Council member Mike Martinez.
[00:24:47.474 --> 00:24:48.255]  Thank you so much.
[00:24:50.052 --> 00:24:56.235]  I've got a proclamation on behalf of the Mayor and City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[00:24:56.995 --> 00:25:10.281]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently, but because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly.
[00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:12.182]  So you hang on to that.
[00:25:13.433 --> 00:25:18.559]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars Nightly News with a gun owner emergency alert.
[00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:29.430]  We sent our reporters out to the Texas Capitol here in Austin to film the Mayor Bloomberg sponsored event with the Austin Police Chief.
[00:25:30.251 --> 00:25:50.159]  calling for the restriction of the second amendment shutting down the gun shows not having private sales restricting quote high-capacity magazines and city councilman mike martinez who's set to be the next mayor came out and pointed at a man in the audience who had a sign saying stop the gun ban
[00:25:51.318 --> 00:25:54.859]  And he said, listen, buddy, you're trying to make attention yelling over there.
[00:25:54.879 --> 00:25:56.439]  We're going to play the clip here in a moment.
[00:25:56.919 --> 00:25:59.200]  He says, that's not happening yet.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.281]  But once we do this, that is going to happen to thunderous applause.
[00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:10.942]  Everywhere these collectivists have been in control, not just worldwide, but in Chicago, New York and other areas, they've banned the guns.
[00:26:11.462 --> 00:26:14.083]  But first, they register them.
[00:26:14.723 --> 00:26:16.063]  First, they register them.
[00:26:16.443 --> 00:26:18.744]  And he says to them, hey, we're not banning your guns right now.
[00:26:19.864 --> 00:26:23.545]  We're going to do what we're doing now, which is registration, and then we're going to take them.
[00:26:24.886 --> 00:26:28.367]  And that's what they've done everywhere, and that's what's so frustrating about this.
[00:26:28.967 --> 00:26:35.909]  We have the clip of the Attorney General, back when he was Deputy Attorney General, saying we're going to brainwash the public against guns in the media.
[00:26:36.109 --> 00:26:41.230]  And what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people.
[00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:47.152]  One thing that I think is clear with young people, and with adults as well, is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:26:47.192 --> 00:26:49.433]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad,
[00:26:49.873 --> 00:26:51.814]  on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:26:51.874 --> 00:26:58.816]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:26:59.296 --> 00:27:07.038]  And then of course we have the clip of Dianne Feinstein on 60 Minutes saying if she had the votes, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn in your semi-autos.
[00:27:07.558 --> 00:27:17.181]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking up every one of them
[00:27:17.861 --> 00:27:20.183]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:27:20.763 --> 00:27:21.444]  I would have done it.
[00:27:21.724 --> 00:27:24.506]  And after they've gotten those, they're going to take all the rest.
[00:27:24.866 --> 00:27:28.008]  The truth is, they're buying millions of bullets, they're buying armored vehicles.
[00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:30.510]  This is an authoritarian takeover.
[00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:34.913]  And when Obama was a state senator, he was for the total abolition of firearms ownership.
[00:27:35.234 --> 00:27:35.834]  The U.N.
[00:27:35.894 --> 00:27:39.376]  treaty they're trying to ratify right now in the Senate does the same thing.
[00:27:39.897 --> 00:27:43.960]  And they admit it in our face, even deep in the heart of Texas,
[00:27:44.966 --> 00:27:51.769]  Mr. Martinez gets up and says, basically, after we register your guns, we are going to confiscate them.
[00:27:52.169 --> 00:27:55.331]  I've got a proclamation on behalf of the Mayor and City Council that we want to present.
[00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:58.172]  I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[00:27:58.973 --> 00:28:05.256]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[00:28:05.716 --> 00:28:12.739]  But, because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your side legit, but shortly.
[00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:14.160]  So you hang on to that.
[00:28:16.323 --> 00:28:20.328]  Mexico has a total gun ban and has had 60,000 gun deaths the last six years.
[00:28:20.989 --> 00:28:23.071]  Because only the government and criminals have guns.
[00:28:24.204 --> 00:28:34.307]  This Second Amendment is a right of all Americans, and it's despicable that these authoritarians creep around on the news and say, we just want reasonable restriction.
[00:28:34.847 --> 00:28:35.807]  Register.
[00:28:36.288 --> 00:28:42.849]  When they're on record, all of them saying they plan to confiscate all our guns as part of a total government takeover of society.
[00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:48.451]  Please get this video out to everyone you know, because they want to act like they're being reasonable and, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:28:48.771 --> 00:28:51.492]  When on record, they really want to confiscate all our firearms.
[00:28:51.852 --> 00:28:54.156]  Alex Jones reporting for M4 Wars Nightly News.
[00:28:54.877 --> 00:29:01.688]  Yes, these men and their hypnotized followers call this a new order.
[00:29:02.689 --> 00:29:06.816]  It is not new, and it is not honor.
[00:29:08.339 --> 00:29:15.344]  Ladies and gentlemen, people like Mike Martinez and Mayor Bloomberg and others are conscious of the fact that it's about state control.
[00:29:15.424 --> 00:29:16.925]  He lives behind armed guards.
[00:29:17.365 --> 00:29:24.871]  He is behind incredible security at the huge edifice to government worship that is the Austin City Council.
[00:29:26.011 --> 00:29:33.276]  And they crave power, they crave uniforms and guns, and they want your guns, your right as a free human.
[00:29:33.296 --> 00:29:36.739]  I burn with a desire for liberty for North Korea and Mexico.
[00:29:38.106 --> 00:29:38.906]  I love those people.
[00:29:40.287 --> 00:29:44.007]  And I burn with defiance against Kim Jong Un and Mike Martinez.
[00:29:45.648 --> 00:29:46.628]  I burn with defiance.
[00:29:46.828 --> 00:29:51.509]  And at least you're honest, though, that you do plan to confiscate our guns.
[00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:54.890]  In fact, I have more respect for you than I do for Arne Saavedra.
[00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.350]  We're on the march.
[00:29:56.851 --> 00:29:58.451]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:59.371 --> 00:30:02.052]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.132 --> 00:30:15.817]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[00:30:54.031 --> 00:30:56.512]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[00:31:06.405 --> 00:31:14.650]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:18.392]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:31:18.632 --> 00:31:22.795]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[00:31:23.095 --> 00:31:27.778]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[00:32:05.945 --> 00:32:12.928]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:32:13.168 --> 00:32:30.794]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:32:31.054 --> 00:32:35.156]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:32:35.456 --> 00:32:37.017]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:32:37.217 --> 00:32:45.062]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:32:45.383 --> 00:32:51.467]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:32:51.687 --> 00:32:52.748]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:32:52.968 --> 00:32:53.708]  It's incredible.
[00:32:53.848 --> 00:33:02.874]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:33:03.054 --> 00:33:04.896]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:05.405]  Yeah.
[00:33:27.574 --> 00:33:36.059]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:42.323 --> 00:33:43.984]  That's what I like, a frontal assault.
[00:33:47.259 --> 00:33:51.503]  Our enemy is weak, that's why they creep around and lie and deceive.
[00:33:52.123 --> 00:34:04.473]  And then only in private moments did she get caught on C-SPAN, Sarah Brady, more than 15 years ago saying, we've got to get the registration before the confiscation, before we can create a socialist America.
[00:34:05.914 --> 00:34:06.455]  That's a quote.
[00:34:07.904 --> 00:34:08.984]  And that's the battle plan.
[00:34:09.024 --> 00:34:13.826]  I mean, Bloomberg has taken all of the guns in New York.
[00:34:14.247 --> 00:34:18.808]  He is financing people to run for office to take guns in Texas.
[00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.229]  He is financing TV ads.
[00:34:21.289 --> 00:34:29.853]  He is taking Mike Martinez and the Austin police chief and flying them up to D.C., flying them up to New York.
[00:34:30.433 --> 00:34:37.777]  A lot of it's taxpayer money paid for as well, while Bloomberg has at least 15 guards at any one time, and while all these guys have guns.
[00:34:38.098 --> 00:34:48.904]  There's Arne Seveda with a gun on his side at the Capitol that clearly holds 15 rounds, a Glock, maybe even more, and he's saying you shouldn't be able to have that.
[00:34:49.841 --> 00:34:51.062]  When you've done nothing wrong.
[00:34:51.082 --> 00:34:53.524]  And he goes, you're either with us, the police, or with the criminals.
[00:34:53.544 --> 00:34:55.987]  See, that's saying you do what we say, or you're criminals.
[00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:57.328]  That's the psychology.
[00:34:57.368 --> 00:34:59.570]  He's giving exact White House talking points.
[00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.393]  And again, your mayor is probably doing it in your town as well.
[00:35:04.274 --> 00:35:05.676]  Because that's what this is all about.
[00:35:05.796 --> 00:35:06.817]  Total domination.
[00:35:07.217 --> 00:35:10.080]  And to have Mike Martinez up there, you know, making a joke.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.202]  Hey, we're not going to take your guns right now.
[00:35:14.022 --> 00:35:18.805]  We're going to take them after we finish the work we're doing today, which is not letting you have a gun that isn't registered.
[00:35:19.185 --> 00:35:22.928]  Not letting you buy a gun where it doesn't go through the database.
[00:35:23.028 --> 00:35:25.830]  And I've got a clip we're going to play later in the next hour.
[00:35:28.972 --> 00:35:35.957]  Adon Salazar did a report on it where CNN says that no guns are being taken in California from anyone.
[00:35:36.397 --> 00:35:37.858]  And they have Larry Pratt on the show.
[00:35:39.059 --> 00:35:41.000]  And the guy's sitting there going, we've never taken any guns.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:41.901]  No one's taking your guns.
[00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:45.000]  And Larry Pratt didn't even know how to respond.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:48.942]  So we're going to be playing a clip of that.
[00:35:48.962 --> 00:35:53.845]  I mean, this is how crazy it's gotten with their incessant lying.
[00:35:54.706 --> 00:35:57.467]  And remember, their followers aren't really authoritarians.
[00:35:57.507 --> 00:36:00.809]  The minions really think that guns come out and kill children.
[00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:07.811]  These are people that have never been in a fistfight, never gone hunting, think being a man is a bad thing.
[00:36:07.871 --> 00:36:09.732]  The men are all beyond effeminate.
[00:36:10.032 --> 00:36:14.113]  The women are all these shrieking weirdos, anti-man-feminist.
[00:36:14.413 --> 00:36:15.773]  I've been to these Million Mom March things.
[00:36:15.833 --> 00:36:17.194]  There'll be like 15 of them.
[00:36:17.434 --> 00:36:18.914]  They're all government people.
[00:36:19.214 --> 00:36:19.634]  All of them.
[00:36:19.974 --> 00:36:20.675]  All bureaucrats.
[00:36:20.755 --> 00:36:21.535]  All living off us.
[00:36:22.175 --> 00:36:23.435]  And they're just crazed-eyed.
[00:36:23.495 --> 00:36:24.576]  They worship the state.
[00:36:24.876 --> 00:36:26.076]  They worship the uniform.
[00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:32.344]  Like when Buzz Bissinger said we ought to kill Alex Jones and Piers Morgan goes, yeah, I can wear my brother's uniform.
[00:36:34.086 --> 00:36:36.748]  Well, the ambassador's daughter goes, you need to wear a uniform when you do it.
[00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:38.410]  I want to be their baby.
[00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.492]  He goes, I can wear my brother's uniform.
[00:36:40.912 --> 00:36:42.313]  He's he's in the military.
[00:36:42.974 --> 00:36:44.455]  They're like, oh, yeah, baby.
[00:36:44.996 --> 00:36:45.296]  Oh, yeah.
[00:36:45.765 --> 00:36:49.287]  Then Buzz Bischner comes out and says, I've spent $600,000 on women's clothes.
[00:36:49.527 --> 00:36:50.547]  Ooh, baby, ooh, baby.
[00:36:50.607 --> 00:36:51.188]  I'm not kidding.
[00:36:51.488 --> 00:36:52.708]  This is who we're talking about.
[00:36:52.909 --> 00:36:55.490]  You're like, oh, you're shocked by me wearing women's clothes.
[00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.830]  No, I don't care, buddy!
[00:36:56.851 --> 00:37:03.614]  I'm going to be looking through my binoculars at nebulas and fish and ponds.
[00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:06.435]  I don't care if you shock me by wearing a dress.
[00:37:06.735 --> 00:37:08.836]  I'm trillions of light years ahead of you.
[00:37:10.237 --> 00:37:11.878]  That's why you're so afraid to die.
[00:37:12.078 --> 00:37:13.539]  It's why you're such a degenerate.
[00:37:14.355 --> 00:37:17.176]  It's because you're not tuned in to everything.
[00:37:17.436 --> 00:37:18.456]  You're a joke!
[00:37:19.257 --> 00:37:23.038]  And I want to tell Mike Martinez and Bloomberg and Feinstein and all of you something.
[00:37:24.298 --> 00:37:42.284]  I come from a good family, my listeners come from good people, and real adversity, and we know the truth, and we know what you are, and you may crave all the power cuddling up to the globalist, competing who can be the slimiest, who can deceive the best, who can get up there like a Pentecostal preacher,
[00:37:43.764 --> 00:37:46.385]  Dr. Police Chief going, nobody's gonna take your guns.
[00:37:46.625 --> 00:37:48.986]  We just want the psychiatrists to be able to do whatever they want.
[00:37:49.486 --> 00:37:51.467]  And you know, you can't have high-capacity mags.
[00:37:51.487 --> 00:37:52.547]  We're gonna arrest you for those.
[00:37:52.747 --> 00:37:54.028]  See, they don't tell you all that.
[00:37:54.548 --> 00:37:55.648]  It's all reasonable.
[00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:57.689]  We just don't want killers to get guns.
[00:37:58.129 --> 00:38:07.152]  Adam Lanza, who supposedly got the guns from his mother, who went through all these background checks and registry to get it, and so now they're just gonna ban those guns in Connecticut.
[00:38:09.104 --> 00:38:09.825]  What are you going to ban?
[00:38:09.865 --> 00:38:10.846]  Exacto knives?
[00:38:10.926 --> 00:38:18.532]  In this sick culture where every show is about a serial killer, every show is about murder and death, and all these weak people get into it and are fascinated by it?
[00:38:19.914 --> 00:38:22.056]  And I always notice they're just these arrested people.
[00:38:22.756 --> 00:38:27.000]  If you'd ever been around real violence, real death, you wouldn't think it was so cute anymore.
[00:38:29.823 --> 00:38:34.227]  Don't worry though, whatever civilizations visualize, they end up manifesting.
[00:38:35.171 --> 00:38:48.628]  And we're going to manifest hell on earth because we've let the worst people get control and then sit there and lecture us and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:38:50.572 --> 00:38:53.573]  For the deaths of the children there.
[00:38:53.733 --> 00:38:55.413]  And they personalize those children.
[00:38:55.674 --> 00:38:58.114]  Well, hundreds of thousands get brain damaged every year.
[00:38:58.414 --> 00:39:00.015]  Thousands die from the vaccines.
[00:39:00.275 --> 00:39:01.355]  The fluoride in the water.
[00:39:01.675 --> 00:39:03.676]  I mean, the tap water, you can almost light it on fire.
[00:39:03.696 --> 00:39:05.116]  In fact, it's lit on fire before in Houston.
[00:39:05.136 --> 00:39:06.637]  I mean, you're just drinking that.
[00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:08.097]  The cancer rate's going straight up.
[00:39:08.277 --> 00:39:09.458]  But none of that's personalized.
[00:39:09.678 --> 00:39:10.838]  None of that's brought out on the news.
[00:39:11.898 --> 00:39:14.079]  Unless it's, oh, look at the cancer victim, the young child.
[00:39:14.339 --> 00:39:15.700]  Why are all the kids getting cancer?
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:16.820]  Gee, we don't know.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.021]  Give money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:39:19.041 --> 00:39:19.801]  They'll find a cure.
[00:39:20.785 --> 00:39:30.608]  By the way, here's a polio vaccine full of five or six different deadly cancer viruses that'll bond to your child's DNA with the RNA and kill them.
[00:39:30.628 --> 00:39:31.269]  How's that sound?
[00:39:32.149 --> 00:39:36.350]  And I mean, this is the type of stuff we're talking about here.
[00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:40.512]  So I want to go over some articles and then to this KHOU report, because you just heard
[00:39:41.762 --> 00:39:55.188]  And next hour I got my reporters that are going to play more behind the scenes, where they're handing out the fake signs to then say they were all grassroots, where they're coming over and intimidating people saying they can't have a sign, you know, that's pro-gun, and then blaming them, saying they're disruptive.
[00:39:55.868 --> 00:40:00.631]  And the police chief coming over and saying, you tell Alex to get it straight and get his story straight!
[00:40:00.851 --> 00:40:02.431]  Nobody wants to take his guns!
[00:40:03.452 --> 00:40:03.752]  Yeah.
[00:40:05.013 --> 00:40:07.794]  And I'm a Chinese jet pilot from Pluto, buddy boy.
[00:40:09.005 --> 00:40:09.726]  Don't you get it?
[00:40:09.867 --> 00:40:10.588]  I see you.
[00:40:10.889 --> 00:40:13.634]  You play your game, how there's no armored vehicles.
[00:40:14.431 --> 00:40:19.074]  By the way, guess who's on the CapMetro board who authorized TSA?
[00:40:19.194 --> 00:40:26.418]  No other cities except New York, Chicago, LA, Detroit, you know, collapsed globalist areas put TSA on the street.
[00:40:26.878 --> 00:40:36.564]  They now sneak them out so I can't go confront them, but every week they pop up somewhere downtown and just stop cars, go to buses, go to trains, dig through bags without warrants.
[00:40:36.904 --> 00:40:37.784]  Mike Martinez!
[00:40:38.345 --> 00:40:39.986]  They want the guns, folks.
[00:40:40.006 --> 00:40:40.946]  You know what you should be worried about?
[00:40:41.326 --> 00:40:43.768]  They've been told by the higher-ups, you get those guns and you get them now.
[00:40:44.048 --> 00:40:50.814]  What do you think they've got planned that they know that the drugged-out, entertainment-out America will wake up?
[00:40:51.275 --> 00:40:55.318]  That they know and are saying to the military, get ready for a civil war years ago.
[00:40:56.339 --> 00:40:59.762]  Gearing up, spying on everybody, trying to find out what military will follow orders.
[00:41:00.022 --> 00:41:05.988]  They're running around like people on the deck of a sinking ship trying to get to lifeboats right now.
[00:41:07.014 --> 00:41:10.015]  Most of the elite are leaving and going to armored islands offshore.
[00:41:10.055 --> 00:41:11.755]  That's been reported on in mainstream news.
[00:41:12.575 --> 00:41:16.956]  They're acting like, because they can't believe they're stealing $85 billion a month, but they can't help themselves.
[00:41:17.276 --> 00:41:22.997]  They can't believe that they're killing thousands of babies a month that are already born in America by dehydrating them.
[00:41:23.157 --> 00:41:30.699]  They can't believe every hospital in the country that's government-controlled is murdering people right now who are begging for water.
[00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:32.819]  You're like, well, that sounds a little radical, is it?
[00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:35.220]  Look up the Wall Street Journal series, Wesley Smith on it.
[00:41:36.929 --> 00:41:40.393]  They can't believe they're getting away with this, so of course they're arming!
[00:41:40.473 --> 00:41:42.195]  The wicked flee when none pursue!
[00:41:44.497 --> 00:41:46.540]  Because they understand, they can calculate and go...
[00:41:48.029 --> 00:41:49.550]  The black uniforms don't intimidate them.
[00:41:49.851 --> 00:41:52.013]  We're flooding the borders wide open, bankrupting everything.
[00:41:52.053 --> 00:41:53.915]  But still, they've got guns.
[00:41:54.215 --> 00:41:56.318]  Even if we vote to take them, they know we're tyrants.
[00:41:56.558 --> 00:41:57.179]  What do we do?
[00:41:57.479 --> 00:41:59.361]  And the elite are offshore, giving their orders.
[00:42:01.103 --> 00:42:02.004]  You take care of them!
[00:42:02.384 --> 00:42:03.606]  You take care of them, Bloomberg!
[00:42:03.866 --> 00:42:05.408]  You take care of them, Mike Martinez!
[00:42:05.848 --> 00:42:06.649]  You take care of them!
[00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:07.911]  You take care of them!
[00:42:09.378 --> 00:42:10.779]  And all the police manuals.
[00:42:11.619 --> 00:42:13.560]  I was watching a Southern Poverty Law Center one last night.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.980]  In fact, we may play it later.
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:15.741]  It's on YouTube.
[00:42:15.801 --> 00:42:18.902]  And the police are like, you need to know these people are ready to die.
[00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:20.703]  They're not going to turn their guns in.
[00:42:21.123 --> 00:42:22.783]  I'm the police chief of West Memphis.
[00:42:23.364 --> 00:42:25.424]  And they killed the other officer and my son.
[00:42:25.444 --> 00:42:26.805]  And they will kill you.
[00:42:26.825 --> 00:42:28.446]  So you got to get after them.
[00:42:28.506 --> 00:42:29.486]  Yeah, that's what you need to do.
[00:42:29.786 --> 00:42:31.607]  Get after people that are willing to die.
[00:42:32.147 --> 00:42:36.589]  Start a fight with people that are... That went real well for the Mexican government in Mexico, didn't it?
[00:42:37.657 --> 00:42:41.520]  Who's got their clock completely cleaned by other cartels that want the money.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.161]  They're like, hey, you think you can kill people, Mexican government?
[00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:45.622]  You think you're the El Jefe?
[00:42:45.842 --> 00:42:47.984]  We're the El Jefes because we worship the Grim Reaper!
[00:42:48.988 --> 00:42:49.949]  Well, you know who I worship?
[00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:52.931]  The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ.
[00:42:53.692 --> 00:42:58.435]  And that's who our founders worshipped, and they kicked the biggest empires butt the world had ever seen that nobody could beat.
[00:42:59.116 --> 00:43:04.040]  And they lost almost every battle, but they persevered and were ready to die and ready to kill.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:05.441]  And so they couldn't be beaten.
[00:43:05.681 --> 00:43:11.045]  The Iraqis, ladies and gentlemen, are known for their courage, but not for their shooting abilities.
[00:43:12.666 --> 00:43:13.006]  Okay?
[00:43:13.587 --> 00:43:14.768]  That's a joke in the military.
[00:43:15.428 --> 00:43:18.631]  But the whole point is, 100,000 troops in Baghdad couldn't hold it.
[00:43:19.542 --> 00:43:19.782]  Okay.
[00:43:20.822 --> 00:43:21.723]  So, here's the deal.
[00:43:22.103 --> 00:43:26.344]  That's why you see Biden and all of them always talking about all the weapons they've got and how powerful they are.
[00:43:26.364 --> 00:43:33.806]  You know, and you got Sharpton and Rangel saying, we got drones now, forget your Second Amendment.
[00:43:34.046 --> 00:43:35.906]  Yeah, I know it's there to protect against a bad government.
[00:43:36.306 --> 00:43:37.787]  Doesn't matter, we got the drones now.
[00:43:37.967 --> 00:43:41.608]  Oh, like, you're a part of the establishment up there, Al Sharpton.
[00:43:43.848 --> 00:43:46.289]  I wonder how many of your family died from vaccines they were given.
[00:43:46.709 --> 00:43:49.531]  Did you get a memo, Al, not to drink the Diet Coke or the tap water?
[00:43:50.051 --> 00:43:57.435]  The only time you mean something, the only time you become somebody is when you join Liberty and stop being a race-baiting pimp.
[00:43:59.235 --> 00:44:00.476]  But these people are defeated.
[00:44:00.536 --> 00:44:01.457]  They've already lost.
[00:44:01.517 --> 00:44:05.579]  If their system comes in, if the New World Order succeeds, population reductions of at least 80%.
[00:44:08.632 --> 00:44:09.653]  Bankrupted future.
[00:44:10.013 --> 00:44:13.055]  People like Mike Martinez are going to have to look at the poverty around them.
[00:44:13.235 --> 00:44:25.202]  Don't you think all the El Jefes in Mexico who've strangled it for hundreds of years and not let their people ever get ahead, do you think they recognize how they've destroyed their own culture and are ensuring the destruction of their own progeny down the road?
[00:44:25.443 --> 00:44:25.623]  No.
[00:44:25.803 --> 00:44:33.708]  They're thinking about how they can dominate and shut people down now because watching other people be successful is a burr in their saddle.
[00:44:35.919 --> 00:44:36.980]  And so they think you're stupid.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.983]  They're going to creep around and say, we don't want your guns.
[00:44:40.203 --> 00:44:41.544]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[00:44:41.985 --> 00:44:45.769]  There's a new clip of Biden saying the black helicopter crowd thinks, you know, we want their guns.
[00:44:45.809 --> 00:44:46.509]  They're crazy.
[00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:52.555]  Oh no, Biden, you just voted for the original assault weapons ban back in the early nineties that would confiscate all semi-autos.
[00:44:53.216 --> 00:44:57.740]  And Feinstein's on tape saying, if I could have gotten that bill, Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in.
[00:44:58.161 --> 00:45:00.323]  And then they'll take all the others like they always do.
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.501]  So let me show you some articles here.
[00:45:04.661 --> 00:45:05.041]  Here it is.
[00:45:05.301 --> 00:45:05.881]  Columnist.
[00:45:06.321 --> 00:45:07.522]  Time columnist.
[00:45:07.822 --> 00:45:08.242]  Warning.
[00:45:08.762 --> 00:45:11.503]  Others about government oppression is anti-government crap.
[00:45:11.603 --> 00:45:13.064]  It doesn't exist.
[00:45:13.164 --> 00:45:16.845]  Klein supports democide, but says you are paranoid if you question government.
[00:45:17.225 --> 00:45:17.605]  That's right.
[00:45:18.045 --> 00:45:19.666]  It's anti-American to question government.
[00:45:20.612 --> 00:45:22.533]  That's, of course, 180 degrees the opposite direction.
[00:45:23.093 --> 00:45:26.494]  DHS contractor apologizes for selling shooting targets of children.
[00:45:26.514 --> 00:45:32.776]  DHS paid them $2 million for targets of five-year-old children and pregnant women to target them to kill them.
[00:45:33.156 --> 00:45:33.537]  Remember that?
[00:45:33.857 --> 00:45:34.517]  Oh, here's Forbes.
[00:45:34.837 --> 00:45:35.437]  How the U.S.
[00:45:35.477 --> 00:45:37.578]  military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[00:45:38.478 --> 00:45:42.660]  Another sheriff has come out with their internal training the feds gave them where it's all about crushing
[00:45:43.956 --> 00:45:52.401]  Patriots and sheriffs, and they tell the sheriffs in these meetings, the feds do, we know a lot of you are with the rebellion and we're gonna get you.
[00:45:52.641 --> 00:45:54.202]  That's a new article by Kurt Nemo.
[00:45:55.363 --> 00:45:59.545]  I told you cops, when you go to this, you're being assessed by an offshore bank mercenary.
[00:45:59.886 --> 00:46:04.869]  That's not Alex Jones rhetoric, that is 100% Veritas, beamed directly to you!
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.884]  That's why the enemy with their fake memes all day says, I'm not real.
[00:46:10.064 --> 00:46:12.606]  Hoping you don't go check into what I'm saying to find out it's real.
[00:46:12.806 --> 00:46:16.129]  Because the fact that I'm real gives you aid and comfort that you're real.
[00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.952]  And we give each other strength to stand against this enemy.
[00:46:20.779 --> 00:46:29.768]  That's why they can't have anybody believe Alex Jones isn't New World Order or isn't CIA or isn't with the Koch brothers or any of this bull.
[00:46:30.068 --> 00:46:31.009]  They have to do that.
[00:46:31.029 --> 00:46:37.376]  The spirit of evil has to do that because it can't ever let anybody know there's other real souls out there.
[00:46:37.896 --> 00:46:39.117]  But you know your soul's real.
[00:46:39.357 --> 00:46:40.198]  You know you're good.
[00:46:40.378 --> 00:46:42.119]  You know liberty beats in your breast.
[00:46:42.479 --> 00:46:45.021]  You know when tyrants menace you, it makes you angry.
[00:46:45.201 --> 00:46:46.282]  It makes you want to resist them.
[00:46:46.522 --> 00:46:47.623]  You know you're not a coward.
[00:46:47.863 --> 00:46:51.225]  You know you have the animating spirit of liberty in your heart and soul and mind.
[00:46:52.726 --> 00:46:54.347]  You feel the presence of God.
[00:46:54.367 --> 00:46:56.589]  These people run from you!
[00:46:56.649 --> 00:46:58.070]  They want you dead!
[00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:00.772]  All those that hate me love death.
[00:47:02.062 --> 00:47:04.404]  How the military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[00:47:05.244 --> 00:47:06.625]  Bullets, you know, for kids.
[00:47:06.725 --> 00:47:07.606]  Training manuals.
[00:47:08.366 --> 00:47:09.967]  Homeland Security youth brigades.
[00:47:09.987 --> 00:47:10.348]  Look at this.
[00:47:10.588 --> 00:47:15.511]  DHS-funded corps ask cops if they will confiscate guns from Christians.
[00:47:15.911 --> 00:47:19.394]  Colorado troopers train to consider Christians as dangerous terrorists.
[00:47:19.434 --> 00:47:23.676]  Don't believe Curt Nemo and fullwars.com or the sheriff or the troopers that have gone public in this article?
[00:47:24.097 --> 00:47:24.657]  Look right here.
[00:47:25.037 --> 00:47:31.782]  Army labeled evangelicals and religious groups as extremists, including all Catholics, all evangelicals, Fox News.
[00:47:32.844 --> 00:47:40.165]  They had Baptist preachers at this anti-gun rally in Austin invoking, using the deep Luciferian terms for Lucifer.
[00:47:41.807 --> 00:47:43.128]  We got that clip coming soon, too.
[00:47:43.989 --> 00:47:49.634]  Ladies and gentlemen, the enemy is making its move as a desperate Battle of the Bulge counter-offensive against us.
[00:47:50.254 --> 00:47:51.015]  You need to understand.
[00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:52.016]  You need to understand.
[00:47:52.036 --> 00:47:54.598]  They're going for everything right now, and this is their moment of danger.
[00:47:55.279 --> 00:47:57.841]  And that's why they're hoaxing and losing all their credibility, because it doesn't matter.
[00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:02.084]  Once they set off a nuke or something and bring in martial law, they plan on trying to arrest us.
[00:48:02.345 --> 00:48:05.928]  They need to get the troops and military ready to go out in phalanxes against us.
[00:48:06.488 --> 00:48:08.750]  That's why you've got an emergency transmit now.
[00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:14.075]  They're going to take over the cell phones, the data, all of it, pumping government bull once they drop the hammer.
[00:48:17.158 --> 00:48:24.525]  But take heart, ladies and gentlemen, the only future is resisting them, and if they think with their actuaries and computer programs they're not going to win, they'll back off.
[00:48:24.805 --> 00:48:26.727]  Now I want to go to this KHOU piece.
[00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:32.092]  You just heard the unedited tape where the city councilman said he's going to get our guns.
[00:48:33.627 --> 00:48:34.847]  After he registers them.
[00:48:35.287 --> 00:48:42.889]  Then they show Mike Martinez, they go, no one's going to take your guns, and Martinez said so, and the Houston TV station cuts to him saying no one's going to take your guns.
[00:48:44.129 --> 00:48:49.410]  Imagine the PSYOPs, and they imply the pro-gun people were causing trouble when it was the other way around.
[00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.210]  Here's that clip.
[00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:57.051]  Rally for tougher gun laws becomes a heated debate when gun rights advocates bring a message of their own.
[00:48:57.471 --> 00:49:00.912]  Tonight, Shannon Murray is live at the state capitol with our top story.
[00:49:02.961 --> 00:49:03.521]  Jade, that's right.
[00:49:03.561 --> 00:49:07.682]  About 100 people showed up at the Capitol today for the Texas Rally for Gun Sense.
[00:49:08.023 --> 00:49:14.625]  And although they were briefly interrupted by gun rights activists, organizers of the rally say that their message today is not about banning guns.
[00:49:14.645 --> 00:49:15.585]  They were not interrupted.
[00:49:16.805 --> 00:49:17.625]  That was not about guns.
[00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:20.646]  Dozens of demonstrators fighting for stricter gun laws.
[00:49:20.886 --> 00:49:22.707]  We talk a lot about this issue.
[00:49:23.467 --> 00:49:25.288]  We need to do something about it!
[00:49:25.328 --> 00:49:26.949]  Dozens of bureaucrats want your guns.
[00:49:26.989 --> 00:49:31.591]  Among the speakers at Saturday's rally, people whose lives have been touched by gun violence.
[00:49:31.991 --> 00:49:33.132]  She could have fought him off.
[00:49:33.152 --> 00:49:35.813]  She would have won if he hadn't had the gun.
[00:49:35.933 --> 00:49:37.294]  No, your daughter should have had a gun.
[00:49:37.314 --> 00:49:44.558]  ...universal background checks, limiting assault weapons, and high-capacity magazines, and they oppose bringing any guns on a school campus.
[00:49:44.798 --> 00:49:48.220]  I used to just be a mom, and now I'm a mom and an activist.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.721]  Hillary Rand is with Moms Demand Action.
[00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:52.022]  Yeah, make sure the schools are...
[00:49:52.962 --> 00:49:54.603]  Shooting clubs for psychos.
[00:49:54.823 --> 00:49:58.704]  I couldn't go on with daily life without trying to make things better.
[00:50:00.085 --> 00:50:03.086]  Neither can we.
[00:50:03.426 --> 00:50:08.048]  I'm all for stopping crime, but I'm a big supporter of the... Hit pause right there!
[00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:09.729]  We're going to go to break.
[00:50:09.769 --> 00:50:10.149]  Back it up.
[00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:11.971]  They keep saying they interrupted.
[00:50:11.991 --> 00:50:12.571]  They interrupted.
[00:50:12.811 --> 00:50:14.072]  These guys, we have all the footage.
[00:50:14.493 --> 00:50:15.193]  Totally calm.
[00:50:15.474 --> 00:50:15.974]  Standing there.
[00:50:16.234 --> 00:50:16.955]  Hold up their signs.
[00:50:16.975 --> 00:50:17.395]  They come over.
[00:50:17.435 --> 00:50:17.936]  Cuss at them.
[00:50:17.956 --> 00:50:18.436]  Push on them.
[00:50:18.596 --> 00:50:19.417]  The police come over.
[00:50:19.797 --> 00:50:20.658]  And don't worry though.
[00:50:20.678 --> 00:50:25.282]  The media will cover up for you and say that the pro-gunners were bad.
[00:50:25.302 --> 00:50:26.503]  And we come back.
[00:50:26.643 --> 00:50:27.304]  Arte Cerveda.
[00:50:28.237 --> 00:50:30.578]  You know, is up there doing his preacher bit.
[00:50:30.618 --> 00:50:31.499]  We don't want your guns.
[00:50:31.859 --> 00:50:35.461]  And then they go, see, even Martinez says nobody wants your guns.
[00:50:35.961 --> 00:50:39.803]  And then they cut to him saying, that sign's going to be needed and legitimate soon.
[00:50:39.823 --> 00:50:41.383]  Because we're coming for your guns.
[00:50:41.624 --> 00:50:42.584]  But they trim it down.
[00:50:42.824 --> 00:50:45.906]  And that's all part, that's KVUE, but it also aired in Houston.
[00:50:45.926 --> 00:50:47.186]  That's why I originally got it from Houston.
[00:50:47.626 --> 00:50:48.867]  That's a local Austin station.
[00:50:49.647 --> 00:50:50.248]  Sitting there,
[00:50:52.248 --> 00:50:56.749]  Showing how masterful they are, because if you show you can lie better, maybe you'll get a job in New York.
[00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:05.632]  Like, taking the truth of them saying we're gonna get your guns after we register them, just saying no one wants your guns and the pro-gun people caused a disturbance, bad boys.

[00:52:23.527 --> 00:52:28.592]  EM-1 helps regulate the soil's pH level and its soil microbes, improving moisture retention and drought tolerance.
[00:52:28.853 --> 00:52:30.294]  Remember last year's dry conditions?

[00:52:57.136 --> 00:52:57.696]  Terragonics.
[00:52:57.716 --> 00:52:58.956]  Life's getting better!
[00:53:06.075 --> 00:53:07.976]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[00:53:08.456 --> 00:53:11.578]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[00:53:11.998 --> 00:53:15.580]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[00:53:15.961 --> 00:53:21.544]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[00:53:21.864 --> 00:53:24.406]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[00:53:24.766 --> 00:53:31.730]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:37.775]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[00:53:38.175 --> 00:53:44.000]  EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:49.745]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[00:53:50.305 --> 00:53:51.787]  Visit EasyArmor.net.
[00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:54.932]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net.
[00:53:55.092 --> 00:53:57.176]  Or call 888-58-ARMOR.
[00:53:57.276 --> 00:53:58.838]  That's 888-582-7667.
[00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:01.442]  EasyArmor.net.
[00:54:01.642 --> 00:54:03.205]  Ultimate door security made easy.
[00:54:28.399 --> 00:54:40.965]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and we're going to have my two reporters with us with breaking news and really showing the manufactured consent that goes on in an anti-gun victim assignment, foreign banker funded collaborator meeting.
[00:54:41.406 --> 00:54:41.986]  That's what it is.
[00:54:42.026 --> 00:54:44.087]  I mean, we're sitting here watching history happen.
[00:54:44.107 --> 00:54:47.449]  People always think of the tyrant that looks like Hitler or Stalin that came before.
[00:54:48.379 --> 00:54:49.059]  Or Napoleon.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.181]  You know, 30 years later, you're looking for a guy that looks like Napoleon.
[00:54:51.681 --> 00:54:54.063]  But every new tyrant, every new attack looks different.
[00:54:54.483 --> 00:54:58.406]  But it's always the same about enslaving and taking control of the society.
[00:54:58.966 --> 00:54:59.587]  And that's what it is.
[00:54:59.627 --> 00:55:03.149]  The governing class and the corporations that have grown up around it, they want us enslaved.
[00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:07.372]  Briefly, if you believe in what we're doing and want to get the word out, go to Infowarstore.com.
[00:55:07.392 --> 00:55:08.392]  We've got a new t-shirt.
[00:55:08.773 --> 00:55:11.374]  We have the AK-47 with the keep and bear arms inside of it.
[00:55:12.155 --> 00:55:12.755]  Come and take it.
[00:55:12.795 --> 00:55:17.959]  Now we have that as well, but an M16 with the Second Amendment inside of it.
[00:55:18.779 --> 00:55:39.428]  And the come and take it and it's red white and blue and that helps get the word out and support the broadcast and I see the t-shirts all over the country not just here in Austin Texas now so good job everybody supporting us and supporting freedom by getting these t-shirts the pro pure water filters 10% off of promo code water lowest price out there on the best systems available period look at the side-by-side comparisons at
[00:55:40.951 --> 00:55:46.953]  at InfowarsStore.com or call toll-free to talk to our crew and operators 888-253-3139.
[00:55:47.033 --> 00:55:51.335]  So if you just tuned in, we're going to play this for the next hour again.
[00:55:51.775 --> 00:55:58.137]  Mike Martinez, part of the Bloomberg crew, with the police chief in Austin, who's up with Obama right now, calling for restrictions.
[00:55:58.938 --> 00:56:00.998]  So these are, you know, globalist operatives here.
[00:56:01.479 --> 00:56:06.200]  They are openly saying, oh, look, the pro-gunners disrupted us.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.221]  Well, we're going to show you the truth.
[00:56:08.121 --> 00:56:10.462]  And, oh, we don't want to take your guns.
[00:56:10.562 --> 00:56:16.326]  And the news media even shows the clip where he admits after we register we're going to try to confiscate.
[00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:18.087]  So, yeah, we are coming for your guns.
[00:56:18.687 --> 00:56:21.088]  But then they cut to it and act like he never said that.
[00:56:21.348 --> 00:56:22.849]  So here is the rest.
[00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:27.392]  It's on the KHOU website, but I guess it's from KVUE here in Austin.
[00:56:27.412 --> 00:56:27.712]  Here it is.
[00:56:28.172 --> 00:56:30.274]  ...formed after the school shooting in Connecticut.
[00:56:30.634 --> 00:56:34.497]  I couldn't go on with daily life without trying to make things better.
[00:56:34.517 --> 00:56:38.900]  Two gun rights activists interrupted the rally, bringing their own message front and center.
[00:56:39.241 --> 00:56:43.484]  I'm all for stopping crime, but I'm a big supporter of the Second Amendment.
[00:56:43.504 --> 00:56:44.225]  He disrupted nothing.
[00:56:44.245 --> 00:56:46.226]  It's a cornerstone of our freedom.
[00:56:46.386 --> 00:56:51.890]  This activist, who goes by Texas George, says he does not believe more gun control is the answer.
[00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:55.093]  All that does is give a law-abiding citizen a disadvantage.
[00:56:55.353 --> 00:56:57.914]  The crowd quickly stood up and tried to block their signs.
[00:56:57.934 --> 00:56:59.554]  Law enforcement even stepped in.
[00:56:59.635 --> 00:57:00.555]  Law enforcement.
[00:57:00.915 --> 00:57:06.597]  It's time to speak up against people who are perpetrating things that just aren't true.
[00:57:06.617 --> 00:57:07.037]  Perpetrating?
[00:57:07.057 --> 00:57:08.518]  Nobody wants to ban guns here.
[00:57:08.578 --> 00:57:14.640]  Austin City Councilman Mike Martinez even addressed the two men, saying the message on their sign is incorrect.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.080]  We will make your sign legitimate shortly.
[00:57:19.782 --> 00:57:20.283]  That's enough.
[00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:22.325]  We'll play more later to show the lie with the report.
[00:57:22.345 --> 00:57:23.526]  We've only got about a minute and a half.
[00:57:23.546 --> 00:57:26.770]  Jakari Jackson, David Knight, you were at this rally a few days ago.
[00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:30.214]  What is it like to see the media spin like that and lie like that?
[00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:31.892]  I thought it was incredible.
[00:57:32.072 --> 00:57:33.813]  That's my first time seeing that clip.
[00:57:33.853 --> 00:57:35.714]  I didn't know that they had that type of spin on it.
[00:57:35.734 --> 00:57:43.880]  Because if you show the whole clip, which we do here at InfoWars, you clearly see the guys out there peacefully protesting silently for the most part.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.583]  Now the taller gentleman who was with him when Martinez addressed him, he addressed Martinez back.
[00:57:48.903 --> 00:57:55.748]  And I do believe we have a clip we'll show our viewers here in a little bit where a guy started cussing and yelling at the two guys who were standing
[00:57:56.508 --> 00:58:04.073]  You know, peacefully with their sign, but the media spin is they were out there interrupting and barging in on this protest when they were doing nothing of the sort.
[00:58:04.473 --> 00:58:10.077]  But I mean, what about saying no one wants to take your guns when Martinez basically said, yeah, we're going to register now and then get them.
[00:58:10.097 --> 00:58:11.678]  You'll need your you'll need that sign.
[00:58:12.338 --> 00:58:12.678]  Oh, yeah.
[00:58:12.718 --> 00:58:16.081]  Just like the lady said, they show the lady and maybe that was her view.
[00:58:16.581 --> 00:58:23.265]  But, you know, they show the clip of Martinez saying, yes, I'm going to take your guns and you're going to need that sign very soon because we're going to take your guns.
[00:58:23.305 --> 00:58:25.687]  Well, they edited his comments to make it sound that way.
[00:58:27.358 --> 00:58:29.239]  It's just incredible.
[00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:33.140]  No one wants your guns and then they spin the Martinez clip to deceive their viewers.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.101]  You guys work in news.
[00:58:35.641 --> 00:58:37.222]  They had to work to be deceptive.
[00:58:37.822 --> 00:58:39.002]  We try to tell the truth.
[00:58:40.383 --> 00:58:42.843]  So much work went into that, folks, because they think you're an idiot.
[00:58:43.124 --> 00:58:44.364]  They're an enemy operation.
[00:58:48.646 --> 00:58:52.607]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:55.945 --> 00:58:57.566]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:58:57.826 --> 00:59:01.328]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:59:01.468 --> 00:59:05.890]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:11.993]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:59:12.133 --> 00:59:22.898]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:59:23.118 --> 00:59:29.404]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:59:29.604 --> 00:59:44.337]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:59:44.777 --> 00:59:46.219]  Waging war on corruption.

[01:00:22.858 --> 01:00:26.939]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:41.373]  Alright folks, I've got my reporters David Knight and Jakari Jackson in studio with us.
[01:00:41.493 --> 01:00:46.296]  I know that XM and some other stations join us in this first hour, but also in the second and third.
[01:00:46.336 --> 01:00:48.037]  So some stations are joining us now.
[01:00:48.897 --> 01:01:02.546]  And gentlemen, how would you recap for people that just tuned in, the state of the all-out war on the Second Amendment, and then watching the microcosm of how the Bloomberg, Wall Street, it's the corporations trying to take our guns so they can get all the corporate welfare.
[01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:09.751]  Watching the Bloomberg machine here in Austin is a microcosm for the rest of the country and the solid wall of deception.
[01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:15.575]  And then Martinez gets off script, the mayor pro-team, and says, well, we're going to register now, then we'll get your guns later.
[01:01:15.595 --> 01:01:15.975]  David Knight?
[01:01:16.435 --> 01:01:18.237]  Yeah, there's a lot of deception with this.
[01:01:18.317 --> 01:01:23.721]  The whole thing is based on deception and saying, if you believe this, you're a conspiracy theorist and you're paranoid.
[01:01:24.321 --> 01:01:29.683]  But when you really scratch them, when you get them really upset, when you get them fired up, they say something like Martinez did.
[01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:35.285]  And what you can see with this crowd shot that we've got there is something that's exactly the opposite of what KHOU had.
[01:01:35.805 --> 01:01:42.687]  KHOU was saying that it was these two Second Amendment activists who were disrupting the crowd, but they were just silently standing there.
[01:01:42.807 --> 01:01:47.609]  And it was the crowd that was crowding around them and holding signs in front of them and in back of them.
[01:01:47.629 --> 01:01:48.469]  We got a clip of that.
[01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:50.470]  And we got a clip of the guy talking.
[01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:51.090]  He was very calm.
[01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:59.282]  And it was the guy in the back that started screaming profanities at a really loud voice, and at that point, Arcevedo and the other cops converged on these two guys.
[01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:00.443]  And they were watching them.
[01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.627]  They weren't watching to protect them from the other crowd.
[01:02:02.687 --> 01:02:03.668]  And this has happened to me!
[01:02:05.134 --> 01:02:08.556]  And his whole Bloomberg group is just all under, you know, globalist control and city control.
[01:02:08.956 --> 01:02:15.199]  It's happened to me all over the country where they have somebody come over and yell and scream, and then the cops come in on you, and then later you see that person leave with them.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:20.922]  Well, it's very telling because, you know, you have Bloomberg with his demand to plan, and these are moms who demand an action.
[01:02:21.082 --> 01:02:25.165]  I mean, it's all coming from the same people, it's the same attitude, and it's the nanny state.
[01:02:25.265 --> 01:02:29.527]  First you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the man, Adolf Hitler.
[01:02:29.687 --> 01:02:39.222]  They're making demands on us, and it's the nanny state, this kind of nanny attitude, and of course they're going to be natural allies with moms, you know, who are going to kind of fit into that whole nanny state thing.
[01:02:39.242 --> 01:02:39.983]  Well, there's another name.
[01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:40.884]  They're called house slaves.
[01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:41.165]  Yeah.
[01:02:42.915 --> 01:02:43.295]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:43.315 --> 01:02:44.276]  No, that's the Roman model.
[01:02:44.296 --> 01:02:45.217]  I mean, I've got the manuals.
[01:02:45.257 --> 01:02:46.038]  These are house slaves.
[01:02:46.538 --> 01:02:49.200]  They're there, the government's their buddy, and they're going to tell the men what to do.
[01:02:49.481 --> 01:02:50.081]  Right, right, right.
[01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:53.584]  I mean, the Bible says the ultimate tyranny, women will be set on top of you.
[01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:54.525]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:02:54.986 --> 01:02:55.766]  Nothing against women.
[01:02:55.946 --> 01:02:57.408]  The women get totally enslaved in it.
[01:02:57.608 --> 01:02:59.069]  Look at where women are in this society.
[01:02:59.389 --> 01:03:03.813]  Totally depressed, pure sex objects now, the opposite of what they claim they didn't want to be.
[01:03:04.454 --> 01:03:05.395]  Jakar, we're going to break.
[01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.137]  Tell us about some of the clips we've got coming up that the great crew's in there running.
[01:03:08.297 --> 01:03:17.464]  Well, coming up we have the clip David was just alluding to where the crowd starts yelling at the two guys who are peacefully protesting and Acevedo and some other police officers come in.
[01:03:17.784 --> 01:03:24.509]  And also we'll show you some crowd comparisons to this most recent Moms Demand action rally versus some of the other ones.
[01:03:24.529 --> 01:03:27.211]  That is banker collaborators demand we be their slaves.
[01:03:27.776 --> 01:03:34.221]  Yeah, they're saying that they don't want your guns, but when Martina says, yeah, we're going to take your guns, everybody starts cheering and clapping.
[01:03:34.601 --> 01:03:35.141]  And we have more.
[01:03:35.181 --> 01:03:41.066]  We have Acevedo's view on registration and Acevedo also criticizing constitutional sheriffs.
[01:03:41.686 --> 01:03:42.807]  I think that's going to be a problem.
[01:03:42.867 --> 01:03:48.312]  Oh, and then after we do that, we'll play Biden saying, oh, the Secret Service is coming to get you.
[01:03:48.572 --> 01:03:54.257]  The bill says they'll have law enforcement power in the states and go after people, sheriffs, that don't do what they're told.
[01:03:54.518 --> 01:03:57.640]  And then they just hope you don't, in fact, I had that in yesterday's stack.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:07.689]  Can somebody from the crew get me the article about, I think it was a Kurt Nimmo article, Secret Service prepares, I think it was Colorado up in arms over Bill to send Secret Service after sheriffs.
[01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:09.111]  And the sheriffs are speaking up.
[01:04:10.421 --> 01:04:12.242]  It's Hickenlooper in Colorado.
[01:04:12.342 --> 01:04:15.064]  Governor Hickenlooper is pushing, yeah, is on the side of that bill.
[01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:17.886]  But I mean, what do you call that when they just lie about everything?
[01:04:19.407 --> 01:04:20.027]  Deception.
[01:04:20.287 --> 01:04:23.229]  That's the only term I could come up to describe that.
[01:04:23.529 --> 01:04:24.290]  Well, it's propaganda.
[01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:32.194]  You know, it's the sort of thing where you tell, it doesn't matter what you say as long as you repeat it enough, and loudly enough, and you ridicule the other side.
[01:04:32.214 --> 01:04:33.175]  That's another Hitler quote.
[01:04:33.315 --> 01:04:34.816]  Yeah, right, right.
[01:04:35.136 --> 01:04:37.638]  So it doesn't matter that we'd link to the documents, right?
[01:04:37.818 --> 01:04:43.562]  Doesn't matter it's on the federal government's home site, doesn't matter it's a bill being debated in Colorado, Biden gets up and goes, that doesn't exist!
[01:04:43.742 --> 01:04:47.104]  They did the same thing their mom said, they hold their signs up in front of it to say something else.
[01:04:47.665 --> 01:04:49.246]  Well, the same thing they did to the Second Amendment
[01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:52.268]  Well, they yell at you and bump into you, and then the cops come over onto you.
[01:04:52.529 --> 01:04:52.689]  Right.
[01:04:52.709 --> 01:04:53.149]  Pretty much.
[01:04:53.409 --> 01:04:53.590]  Yeah.
[01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.791]  Can you imagine how they're going to act once they get our guns?
[01:04:55.811 --> 01:04:57.813]  I mean, they're literally going to have us in slave camps.
[01:04:58.013 --> 01:04:58.634]  They've said they are.
[01:04:58.674 --> 01:05:02.217]  We'll be back with the city councilman saying, well, get your guns after registration.
[01:05:06.064 --> 01:05:08.806]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:05:09.086 --> 01:05:13.909]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:21.254]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:05:21.414 --> 01:05:26.819]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:08:22.997 --> 01:08:27.119]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.281]  Ladies and gentlemen, a full out...
[01:08:33.061 --> 01:08:37.784]  A total 360 degree attack is going on in the entire Bill of Rights.
[01:08:37.864 --> 01:08:40.586]  State's rights, First Amendment, Second Amendment.
[01:08:40.786 --> 01:08:43.768]  They're arresting people all over the country for filming police in public.
[01:08:44.389 --> 01:08:46.390]  5 years, 10 years, 20 years in jail.
[01:08:48.412 --> 01:08:49.833]  85 billion a month to foreign banks.
[01:08:49.873 --> 01:08:51.494]  They can't believe they've gotten away with this.
[01:08:51.974 --> 01:08:55.797]  And now, they're going full tilt boogie, just using the 20 dead children.
[01:08:56.664 --> 01:09:00.987]  Ignoring, you know, medical neglect, killing hundreds of thousands a year, all the rest of it.
[01:09:01.427 --> 01:09:03.709]  The drones killing hundreds of children a week.
[01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:06.271]  And just saying it's your fault, gun owners.
[01:09:06.811 --> 01:09:09.293]  You need to give us your guns and just be reasonable.
[01:09:09.333 --> 01:09:10.734]  We don't want your guns.
[01:09:11.094 --> 01:09:13.876]  Even though everywhere we get control after we register, we do take them.
[01:09:13.896 --> 01:09:15.657]  I mean, look at New York.
[01:09:15.677 --> 01:09:16.538]  They've taken everybody's guns.
[01:09:16.578 --> 01:09:17.038]  Chicago.
[01:09:17.058 --> 01:09:17.619]  Look at Europe.
[01:09:17.839 --> 01:09:18.740]  It's the same plan.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:20.101]  Register, then confiscate.
[01:09:20.501 --> 01:09:23.143]  And City Councilman Mike Martinez, Mayor Pro Tem,
[01:09:24.771 --> 01:09:29.452]  Uh, fast-tracked with Bloomberg, just like our police chief who was there with him, if you're listening around the country.
[01:09:30.652 --> 01:09:32.953]  Yesterday, press conferences with Biden.
[01:09:33.633 --> 01:09:35.053]  I mean, he's up there talking, folks.
[01:09:35.073 --> 01:09:37.814]  He's not just a police chief behind him, because he is slick.
[01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:42.895]  I've said privately, either this guy is a silver-tongued psychopath, or he's actually a good guy.
[01:09:42.915 --> 01:09:46.416]  But he, he, but I, I said, I think he's a bad guy.
[01:09:46.756 --> 01:09:48.557]  And I've said that, I've even told him that in the hallway.
[01:09:48.577 --> 01:09:49.857]  And he's like, no, I'm not.
[01:09:49.897 --> 01:09:51.077]  I came from Cuba in tyranny.
[01:09:51.117 --> 01:09:51.817]  I don't want to live under it.
[01:09:52.097 --> 01:09:53.958]  But the fact is, Ace Veda knows what he's doing.
[01:09:54.967 --> 01:09:58.690]  And he may have lied to himself or whatever, well this is the way it's going, I'll just go along with it.
[01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:05.675]  But my crew was there, and this is a guy being brought in by Bloomberg, really to be one of the main spokesmen against us now.
[01:10:06.115 --> 01:10:18.324]  Because Austin is a key city, ladies and gentlemen, fastest growing, wealthiest in the country per capita, the heart of Texas, it's part of the UN Agenda 21, they call it the Tri-City Map to take over the state via Austin, it's the capital.
[01:10:19.105 --> 01:10:20.526]  And this video
[01:10:21.566 --> 01:10:26.330]  I'm going to have our reporters break it down, because we've got eight clips here, and eight different angles of deception.
[01:10:27.211 --> 01:10:35.517]  But David Knight, who was there with Jakari Jackson, this was this weekend, and we finally got around to looking at the footage a few days ago, as the guy's been busy with other news.
[01:10:35.897 --> 01:10:41.902]  Break down, well first let's play the clip, and then we'll get David Knight and Jakari Jackson's take on it, and then walk through these other clips.
[01:10:42.202 --> 01:10:45.885]  But here is the Austin City Council member to a guy that has a sign,
[01:10:46.854 --> 01:10:48.975]  For new listeners saying, stop gun ban.
[01:10:49.576 --> 01:10:52.157]  And he says, hey, we're not going to ban guns right now.
[01:10:52.417 --> 01:10:53.258]  This is not an assault.
[01:10:53.278 --> 01:10:54.258]  This is not a Tet Offensive.
[01:10:55.219 --> 01:10:55.579]  Don't run.
[01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:56.360]  We are your friends.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.981]  This is not an assault at the Waco compound.
[01:10:59.008 --> 01:11:04.971]  But, after we do this, which is gun registration, you will need that sign, because we are going to do that.
[01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:07.013]  You'll need that sign to which the crowd roars.
[01:11:07.453 --> 01:11:11.175]  And Martinez has already said, shut down the gun shows, you know, ban the guns before.
[01:11:11.255 --> 01:11:12.936]  So, this is their plan.
[01:11:12.976 --> 01:11:16.398]  They say it all the time, but then they tell you, oh, that's not our plan.
[01:11:16.958 --> 01:11:17.579]  So they're not trying to...
[01:11:18.459 --> 01:11:19.019]  Thank you so much.
[01:11:47.332 --> 01:11:53.381]  I've got a proclamation on the African American City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words and I'll be brief.
[01:11:54.142 --> 01:12:01.092]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently, but...
[01:12:02.768 --> 01:12:07.430]  Because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly.
[01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:09.151]  So you hang on to that.
[01:12:09.231 --> 01:12:12.052]  Alright, and there's the Thunderous Jones here for applause.
[01:12:12.392 --> 01:12:14.974]  And then it goes into the rest of my report showing more of them saying it.
[01:12:15.394 --> 01:12:19.015]  You can go to InfoWars.com and see all of our articles.
[01:12:19.055 --> 01:12:20.676]  You can also go to DrugsReport.com.
[01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:21.456]  We're in New York.
[01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:30.561]  They're now announcing they're going after everyone who's ever been on any type of antidepressant meds or meds period that are seen as anti-anxiety.
[01:12:31.701 --> 01:12:35.386]  And this is how it is, get you in the system, then declare you mentally defunct.
[01:12:35.666 --> 01:12:37.649]  It's happening to the veterans, it's gonna happen to everybody now.
[01:12:37.989 --> 01:12:42.094]  This is the full authoritarian takeover to persecute gun owners and libertarians.
[01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:46.881]  Okay guys, Jakari Jackson, David Knight, walk through these clips, you've got the floor.
[01:12:47.568 --> 01:12:48.809]  Well, we've got a couple of things here.
[01:12:48.849 --> 01:12:50.190]  First, to kind of talk about the crowd.
[01:12:50.210 --> 01:12:57.114]  We're going to talk about what Acevedo said when he attacked constitutional sheriffs and when he talks about are we on the slippery slope with registration.
[01:12:57.174 --> 01:12:58.415]  We've got a couple of clips about that.
[01:12:58.715 --> 01:12:59.836]  But first, we wanted to show the crowd.
[01:12:59.856 --> 01:13:07.141]  So, let's show this first clip here showing what really happened with that Second Amendment supporter there at that crowd.
[01:13:07.161 --> 01:13:15.487]  I'd like to say, believe in your Second Amendment, the Bill of Rights, and realize that's what made this country great.
[01:13:16.554 --> 01:13:19.315]  And it's not about taking guns away from people.
[01:13:19.435 --> 01:13:22.095]  It's not going to do anything to stop crime.
[01:13:22.335 --> 01:13:28.456]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[01:13:28.476 --> 01:13:36.057]  But because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your sign legitimate shortly.
[01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:43.959]  So you hang on to that.
[01:13:50.533 --> 01:13:51.674]  He's saying eff you, eff you.
[01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:54.596]  That guy right there.
[01:13:54.636 --> 01:13:56.877]  He's the instigator.
[01:13:57.098 --> 01:13:58.138]  Wait, I've seen him before.
[01:13:58.158 --> 01:13:59.219]  Oh yeah?
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:08.246]  Yeah, I've had, I've had... Oh, these are all... Acevedo comes down and gets around them and now you'll see the police converge on these guys.
[01:14:08.266 --> 01:14:09.807]  Look at Acevedo bugging his eyes out.
[01:14:11.101 --> 01:14:11.461]  Look at this.
[01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:12.862]  As he moves from one side to the other.
[01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:14.083]  They're trying to cover his sign.
[01:14:14.323 --> 01:14:15.283]  Front and back.
[01:14:16.484 --> 01:14:18.665]  And they say that's the guy who interrupted him.
[01:14:19.546 --> 01:14:21.647]  No, I mean, they physically assault him.
[01:14:21.787 --> 01:14:24.009]  I mean, that lady, really kind of a punch.
[01:14:24.069 --> 01:14:24.429]  Boom.
[01:14:24.529 --> 01:14:26.230]  You know how a woman will peck at you?
[01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:27.210]  That was a peck right there.
[01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:29.732]  She came in with a little pecker and, you know, pecked him.
[01:14:30.212 --> 01:14:32.414]  You see the cops right there.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:39.564]  Boy, that guy looks tough, that pro-gun guy.
[01:14:39.584 --> 01:14:41.905]  These idiots have no idea, because they're not going to stop.
[01:14:41.925 --> 01:14:43.406]  They're already announcing our kids are theirs.
[01:14:43.607 --> 01:14:44.607]  They just want a war.
[01:14:44.627 --> 01:14:46.068]  They're going to get it, too.
[01:14:47.269 --> 01:14:47.810]  I'm telling you.
[01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:48.150]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:48.490]  Go ahead.
[01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:54.155]  You saw the two guys, the pro-gun guys, were out there peacefully protesting.
[01:14:54.195 --> 01:14:57.477]  Now, when Martinez addressed them, they addressed Martinez back.
[01:14:57.797 --> 01:15:02.601]  And then you saw the younger guy behind him started yelling and cussing, and we had to bleep it out for our viewers.
[01:15:02.641 --> 01:15:03.802]  But they were saying, you know,
[01:15:04.222 --> 01:15:06.604]  F-words and you A-hold and all this stuff to the guys.
[01:15:06.624 --> 01:15:06.944]  Real loud.
[01:15:07.224 --> 01:15:08.105]  Oh yeah, real loud.
[01:15:08.205 --> 01:15:13.049]  And then the cops come converge on the two guys who are minding their own business, not the young guy who's yelling and cussing.
[01:15:13.069 --> 01:15:20.154]  Well, you've seen people that have gone out to these illegal immigration rallies, where millions of illegals, in some cases hundreds of thousands, but millions total are marching.
[01:15:20.194 --> 01:15:22.095]  I've got it in Endgame, the extra.
[01:15:22.476 --> 01:15:32.143]  And the guy is simply there protesting himself peacefully, and the cops beating, blood's coming out of his face, and the illegals come over and taunt and join in, and the cops are like high-fying him.
[01:15:32.683 --> 01:15:34.323]  I mean, this is a takeover, folks.
[01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.844]  And again, it's not to empower the illegals either.
[01:15:36.904 --> 01:15:37.984]  It's just all a takeover.
[01:15:38.404 --> 01:15:41.365]  When you look at this, you see what their attitude toward the First Amendment is.
[01:15:41.585 --> 01:15:42.725]  You see what their tolerance is.
[01:15:42.825 --> 01:15:47.126]  I mean, they're making demands on everybody and they don't have any respect for the First Amendment anymore.
[01:15:47.146 --> 01:15:48.466]  They have respect for the Second Amendment.
[01:15:48.666 --> 01:15:57.887]  And what they're doing with this guy in terms of standing in front of him and blocking him front and back is the same thing that Biden and these other guys are doing when we try to get the truth out there about the ammunition purchases and everything.
[01:15:58.067 --> 01:16:01.408]  They just hold up more signs in front of us and say, oh, you're crazy.
[01:16:01.408 --> 01:16:06.473]  It'd be like if you came up to the bank and an old lady came up and saw guys in masks with bags of money, and she said, are you robbing the bank?
[01:16:06.513 --> 01:16:07.654]  And you're like, he's wearing a mask.
[01:16:07.694 --> 01:16:08.855]  He goes, no ma'am, we're not.
[01:16:08.875 --> 01:16:10.397]  I mean, it's that level.
[01:16:10.437 --> 01:16:10.837]  Ja'Kari?
[01:16:11.197 --> 01:16:20.186]  Yeah, it just, it shows that they want their voice to be heard, their angle to be heard, but if you have a differing opinion, they just completely shut them down.
[01:16:21.367 --> 01:16:22.308]  You're absolutely right.
[01:16:22.368 --> 01:16:23.149]  What's the next clip?
[01:16:23.848 --> 01:16:26.570]  Well, the next one we got is kind of a thing about, go ahead.
[01:16:27.711 --> 01:16:34.536]  Oh, well this one, the next clip is about, somebody asked Acevedo, or he brings up the statement about the gun crime in Chicago.
[01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:40.140]  And he said, I'm tired of people bringing up gun crime in Chicago as, you know, a reason why they need their guns.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.681]  So if we have that clip ready, we can go ahead and play it.
[01:16:41.701 --> 01:16:42.322]  This is amazing.
[01:16:42.362 --> 01:16:45.764]  I'm tired of people saying this to the American people.
[01:16:46.465 --> 01:16:53.010]  If gun laws are so good and so effective, why is there so much gun violence in Chicago?
[01:16:53.897 --> 01:16:56.218]  Why is there so much gun violence in Philadelphia?
[01:16:56.338 --> 01:16:57.459]  I will tell you why.
[01:16:58.199 --> 01:17:03.582]  Because those guns are coming out from other parts of the country where we have a loophole that's bigger than the Grand Canyon.
[01:17:03.862 --> 01:17:05.343]  That's where those guns are coming from.
[01:17:06.468 --> 01:17:11.833]  David, with regard to guns, we need to take away the reason that people are shooting one another.
[01:17:11.973 --> 01:17:13.014]  That's right, and that's the key.
[01:17:13.034 --> 01:17:23.183]  In Chicago, the superintendent of police says 80% of the killings are from gangs fighting over the control of drugs.
[01:17:23.343 --> 01:17:23.864]  Exactly.
[01:17:23.884 --> 01:17:25.125]  Doesn't that tell us something?
[01:17:25.545 --> 01:17:38.016]  So, if you want to talk about the control of drugs or you want to talk about guns, you need to take away the reason that the people are using the drugs and why the people are buying and using the guns.
[01:17:38.037 --> 01:17:41.400]  And that's a former prosecutor you interviewed, but I just want to say this about Acevedo.
[01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:44.102]  Why don't we have that crime rate here?
[01:17:44.162 --> 01:17:46.003]  Because loophole guns could come here.
[01:17:46.444 --> 01:17:48.225]  It's because it's a... Go ahead, Jakari.
[01:17:48.245 --> 01:17:49.246]  No, that's the exact point.
[01:17:49.286 --> 01:17:57.551]  Like David brought up the point that if, let's say they are getting their guns from Texas or wherever else, then we should have at least the same amount of crime that they have in Chicago.
[01:17:57.911 --> 01:17:59.913]  Every one of these liberal cities is not liberal.
[01:17:59.953 --> 01:18:01.374]  These are mafia families.
[01:18:01.814 --> 01:18:08.819]  They bring in the drugs, the whores, the corruption, and then that's all that can... and the criminals all move there because less than half the murders get solved there.
[01:18:09.299 --> 01:18:12.121]  Chicago's the place to go bust in houses and rape women.
[01:18:12.641 --> 01:18:16.525]  By his argument, we should have a high crime rate because we have free access to guns.
[01:18:16.586 --> 01:18:17.747]  So it should be higher, higher.
[01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:20.650]  But the other thing is, is that he wants to invoke Chicago.
[01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:25.555]  We've got a former prosecutor who was there for 43 years as a Cook County prosecutor.
[01:18:25.635 --> 01:18:26.216]  In Chicago?
[01:18:26.276 --> 01:18:26.836]  In Chicago.
[01:18:27.157 --> 01:18:33.343]  And he quotes the current Chicago police chief saying that 80% of the shootings in Chicago are because of drugs.
[01:18:33.363 --> 01:18:34.384]  And you interviewed him last week.
[01:18:34.404 --> 01:18:35.065]  Give people his name.
[01:18:35.365 --> 01:18:39.847]  His name is Jim Geerak, and he's with Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[01:18:40.227 --> 01:18:45.669]  It's former prosecutors and former... And you can just see in his eyes, he's a caring, loving, good person.
[01:18:45.689 --> 01:18:50.551]  And then you look in the eyes of Martinez or Bloomberg, these are evil, power-tripping villains.
[01:18:50.591 --> 01:18:52.871]  I mean, you know a bad guy when they're that bad.
[01:18:53.092 --> 01:18:53.892]  They don't want to hide it.
[01:18:53.912 --> 01:18:55.592]  I mean, these are bad people!
[01:18:55.612 --> 01:18:57.013]  I mean, it's just like, come on!
[01:18:57.073 --> 01:19:06.957]  When we look at the gun statistics that Piers Morgan puts out there, it needs to be said that the majority, like he said in Chicago, 80% of these gun shootings are because of drug probing.
[01:19:06.977 --> 01:19:09.299]  And then they say, well you don't care because it's the gangs.
[01:19:09.359 --> 01:19:13.000]  No, but gangbangers killing each other over government shipped in drugs.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.381]  Don't take my guns!
[01:19:14.761 --> 01:19:15.701]  That's right, that's right.
[01:19:16.141 --> 01:19:19.042]  But they want to turn it against legitimate, peaceful guns.
[01:19:19.062 --> 01:19:23.024]  Well, we've also got the statistic of the 49% drop in violent crime in the last 20 years.
[01:19:23.064 --> 01:19:24.524]  That's the big secret, where the guns are.
[01:19:24.564 --> 01:19:26.665]  Jakari, tell us what's coming up after the break, the other clips.
[01:19:26.805 --> 01:19:38.048]  After this break, we'll have a comparison of crowds to the moms, to some other events, and also Acevedo as he criticizes constitutional sheriffs, and Acevedo's view on gun registration, and much more.
[01:19:38.589 --> 01:19:41.630]  And continuing with guns, we've got the head of the
[01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:44.672]  Amazing, they're rock stars to me.
[01:19:44.992 --> 01:19:51.860]  The Veritas Project, uh, you know, the folks that blew up Acorn politically, they went, they went out... I'd say politically, yeah.
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:52.741]  Absolutely.
[01:19:52.761 --> 01:19:54.022]  Well, they blew them up.
[01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:56.905]  They absolutely destroyed them.
[01:19:57.266 --> 01:19:59.328]  Now they've gone to the house of Piers Morgan, and guess what?
[01:19:59.348 --> 01:20:00.069]  He's got armed guards.
[01:20:00.589 --> 01:20:03.773]  I mean, these hypocrites make me want to throw up.
[01:20:06.263 --> 01:20:07.204]  Start life over.
[01:20:07.424 --> 01:20:09.105]  Spend more quality time with your family.
[01:20:09.205 --> 01:20:10.146]  Take more vacations.
[01:20:10.326 --> 01:20:11.306]  Own your own business.
[01:20:11.467 --> 01:20:14.108]  Be healthy and earn the kind of income you've always dreamed of.
[01:20:14.369 --> 01:20:15.069]  Is it possible?
[01:20:15.409 --> 01:20:16.870]  Yes, with Longevity.

[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.700]  Have you ever experienced missized jeans from China?

[01:23:16.512 --> 01:23:22.896]  Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps, low moisture, and low oxygen.
[01:23:22.996 --> 01:23:25.258]  If you're storing in a basement, too humid.
[01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:27.299]  Garages and attics, too hot.
[01:23:27.459 --> 01:23:32.002]  But the waterproof, double-walled, high-density polyethylene patent-pending EatPod
[01:23:32.142 --> 01:23:45.431]  The Eatpod is a unique rollaway food bunker that creates the perfect conditions, can be buried up to 30 feet, and can keep your survival food supply safe, secure, dry, and virtually undetectable for 25 years or more.

[01:23:52.475 --> 01:23:54.257]  The Eatpod from Long Life Food Depot.

[01:24:06.965 --> 01:24:12.108]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:12.788 --> 01:24:15.090]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:17.992 --> 01:24:19.493]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:24.476]  You know, I wanted to believe in Chief Artist Aveda, and I think he's been in studio with me three or four times over the years.
[01:24:25.597 --> 01:24:25.797]  But...
[01:24:27.233 --> 01:24:29.635]  I was like, if this guy's an operative, he's going to go to the top.
[01:24:29.915 --> 01:24:31.056]  This guy may be deep cover.
[01:24:31.536 --> 01:24:33.577]  And I've said that to a lot of people behind the scenes here.
[01:24:34.638 --> 01:24:35.539]  And they all agreed.
[01:24:36.299 --> 01:24:38.401]  But now, he's like in the bosom of Obama.
[01:24:38.461 --> 01:24:43.824]  And he came out of the Justice Department as a state police officer, as one of their operatives, spying on the police there.
[01:24:44.265 --> 01:24:46.546]  And I'm not against checks and balances, federal, state.
[01:24:47.026 --> 01:24:48.127]  It's just that there's no checks now.
[01:24:48.187 --> 01:24:49.968]  It's the feds only taking over the state.
[01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:52.810]  Jakari, David Knight, you guys were at this
[01:24:54.232 --> 01:24:56.955]  15 Bureaucrat March, a Million Mom March, 15 Bureaucrat March.
[01:24:58.297 --> 01:25:03.684]  You know, the wives and husbands of city council people and state bureaucrats and federal bureaucrats get into the fake signs.
[01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:04.345]  I've seen this at the U.N.
[01:25:04.365 --> 01:25:06.688]  where they have all the fake signs, they hand them out.
[01:25:06.928 --> 01:25:07.909]  That's the next clip, isn't it?
[01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:08.911]  Yeah.
[01:25:08.931 --> 01:25:09.552]  Tell us about that.
[01:25:10.728 --> 01:25:14.269]  Well, as we got there, my wife was there, and she just recorded some of it with her iPhone.
[01:25:14.449 --> 01:25:17.430]  And basically, they had handwritten signs that they were handing out to people.
[01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:24.772]  And we wanted to contrast that with the Day of Resistance, which was a pro-Second Amendment rally that was really a grassroots organization.
[01:25:25.232 --> 01:25:28.773]  And, you know, when they start doing things like this, the first thing that comes to mind is AstroTurf.
[01:25:28.813 --> 01:25:33.355]  You know, and quite frankly, this Moms Demand a Plan is very well financed.
[01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:35.535]  Their website is really top-notch.
[01:25:35.555 --> 01:25:39.017]  I mean, you know, obviously, when you look at the Day of Resistance, it was something that was thrown together.
[01:25:39.037 --> 01:25:40.497]  No, it's a known Bloomberg front.
[01:25:40.797 --> 01:25:41.278]  Mm-hmm.
[01:25:41.618 --> 01:25:42.679]  So we want to take a look at this.
[01:25:42.699 --> 01:25:43.961]  We got a clip of them handing out.
[01:25:44.061 --> 01:25:44.642]  Let's go to that.
[01:25:45.302 --> 01:25:46.303]  This was fantastic.
[01:25:46.364 --> 01:25:48.386]  I have to tell you, we really missed Alex here today.
[01:25:48.626 --> 01:25:49.687]  It was a great crowd.
[01:25:50.508 --> 01:25:53.292]  Maybe 2,500 people.
[01:25:53.532 --> 01:25:55.614]  It was just jam-packed with people.
[01:25:55.634 --> 01:25:56.375]  That's Sheriff Mack.
[01:25:56.615 --> 01:25:57.536]  Yes, Sheriff Mack.
[01:25:57.576 --> 01:26:00.480]  Dedicated to the Holy Cause of Liberty, as Dr. Henry called it.
[01:26:01.468 --> 01:26:04.292]  This is the day of resistance, and you can see the real signs right there.
[01:26:04.512 --> 01:26:05.053]  Real people.
[01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:06.635]  That looks like a thousand or more.
[01:26:06.695 --> 01:26:07.115]  I wasn't there.
[01:26:07.135 --> 01:26:07.836]  How many thousands?
[01:26:08.016 --> 01:26:09.438]  They showed up with their own signs.
[01:26:09.478 --> 01:26:10.980]  I mean, they had them in the back of their trucks.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.804]  Here's a grandmother, mother, NRA life member.
[01:26:13.944 --> 01:26:15.406]  This is the most recent.
[01:26:16.487 --> 01:26:19.251]  And listen here.
[01:26:21.321 --> 01:26:22.623]  Thank you for making them.
[01:26:22.663 --> 01:26:23.283]  You're welcome.
[01:26:23.363 --> 01:26:24.525]  Thank you for making them.
[01:26:24.725 --> 01:26:26.106]  Thank you for holding their sign.
[01:26:26.166 --> 01:26:27.708]  They're handing out signs.
[01:26:27.788 --> 01:26:29.550]  And they're all done looking different.
[01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.231]  Yeah.
[01:26:30.511 --> 01:26:38.780]  I mean, it's just... It's something, you know, if you go to a Romney rally or a Ron Paul rally, they've got signs they hand out to people, and it's obviously that they're printed up, right?
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:39.541]  People are holding that.
[01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:40.502]  Yeah, they're all uniform.
[01:26:40.542 --> 01:26:41.463]  Then it's not deceptive.
[01:26:41.503 --> 01:26:42.824]  It's Ron Paul, boom, you know.
[01:26:42.924 --> 01:26:49.828]  Right, but you make up a lot of different... But if Ron Paul had a whole bunch of different ones that looked like they were grassroots and was fake, I mean, it'd be a scandal.
[01:26:50.129 --> 01:26:53.030]  Yeah, you can see all the signs they have on the table right there.
[01:26:54.491 --> 01:26:57.973]  For radio listeners, you can watch us right now streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:26:57.993 --> 01:27:02.676]  This will be archived later in the day at PrisonPlanet.tv and then tomorrow at InfoWars.com for radio listeners.
[01:27:02.696 --> 01:27:06.459]  But this is powerful info because it shows it's all a fraud.
[01:27:06.679 --> 01:27:06.839]  Right.
[01:27:06.859 --> 01:27:10.381]  Well, that's something that bears some more investigation about whether it's AstroTurf or not.
[01:27:10.561 --> 01:27:11.302]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:27:11.322 --> 01:27:12.523]  We have more clips to get to.
[01:27:13.164 --> 01:27:16.367]  Our next clip is Acevedo as he criticizes constitutional sheriffs.
[01:27:16.387 --> 01:27:17.327]  People like Sheriff Mack.
[01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:18.829]  So the guys are ready with that clip.
[01:27:18.849 --> 01:27:19.790]  We can get that rolling.
[01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:20.410]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:26.136]  You can't say that you stand for the Constitution as an elected sheriff law enforcement official as part of the executive branch.
[01:27:27.117 --> 01:27:36.801]  Invoke the Constitution in terms of the Second Amendment and turn around and absolutely ignore the rest of our 200 years of law that talks about the separation of powers.
[01:27:37.401 --> 01:27:39.982]  You are the executive branch, whether you like it or not.
[01:27:40.503 --> 01:27:49.126]  Your job is to enforce the law as passed by the legislative branch, as interpreted by the judicial branch, as it's carried out by the executive branch.
[01:27:49.386 --> 01:27:51.047]  And to say otherwise is hypocrisy.
[01:27:51.067 --> 01:27:51.787]  God bless you all.
[01:27:52.048 --> 01:27:52.808]  Thanks for being here.
[01:27:53.772 --> 01:27:59.839]  If you analyze the statistics honestly, I think you'll see that it is better to have a government.
[01:27:59.959 --> 01:28:01.500]  However, those are immaterial.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:12.032]  Those arguments mean nothing when you live in a country where the supremacy of the land completely and entirely forbids gun control in this country.
[01:28:12.552 --> 01:28:16.355]  All forms of gun control are against the law here.
[01:28:16.455 --> 01:28:20.637]  In my book, The Magic of Gun Control, there's a book called Gun Control in America.
[01:28:20.737 --> 01:28:21.618]  It's against the law.
[01:28:21.658 --> 01:28:29.082]  We're going to need local officials, especially sheriffs, to tell the federal government there's just a few things you're not going to do in our county.
[01:28:29.603 --> 01:28:32.084]  And one of them is gun control.
[01:28:32.184 --> 01:28:32.925]  It's against the law.
[01:28:33.345 --> 01:28:35.106]  All right, again, a lot of crowd noise there.
[01:28:35.266 --> 01:28:38.248]  But, I mean, talk about what Acevedo is saying there.
[01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:40.550]  And again, we have a clip after the break.
[01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:45.233]  Biden is running around saying the black helicopter people think we're going to send the Secret Service into your states.
[01:28:45.633 --> 01:28:52.457]  They've got bills introduced that they're trying to ram through where they will send them in to go after sheriffs.
[01:28:52.497 --> 01:28:53.378]  I mean, it's just the same.
[01:28:53.418 --> 01:28:54.419]  It's a military tactic.
[01:28:54.619 --> 01:28:56.360]  We're not trying to take your guns, even though we are.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:57.340]  There are no bullets.
[01:28:57.581 --> 01:28:59.802]  There is no bill for Secret Service to come into your state.
[01:29:00.042 --> 01:29:02.604]  I mean, they lie to you because you are seen as an enemy.
[01:29:02.924 --> 01:29:04.665]  This standard military operation.
[01:29:05.245 --> 01:29:07.425]  Well, it's very interesting to see what Acevedo is doing.
[01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:12.307]  What he's doing is he's taking a system of checks and balances that wasn't just at the federal level.
[01:29:12.507 --> 01:29:15.447]  There were checks and balances, you know, where the people have a check and balance.
[01:29:15.467 --> 01:29:16.408]  They have the Second Amendment.
[01:29:16.428 --> 01:29:17.708]  They've got jury nullification.
[01:29:17.748 --> 01:29:20.009]  The states have a check and a balance against the federal government.
[01:29:20.249 --> 01:29:28.031]  And what he's doing is he's taking away that system of checks and balances, and he's trying to substitute a rigid hierarchy that is federally based.
[01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:29.351]  And that's what his speech was about.
[01:29:29.451 --> 01:29:31.792]  That's why he attacked the constitutional sheriff.
[01:29:31.852 --> 01:29:38.476]  All right, we've got our next guest coming up, but I want you guys to stay over and finish that last clip and talk about what we're facing here.
[01:29:38.536 --> 01:29:47.141]  But the big news is, and the video's up at InfoWars.com, of the Austin City Councilman who's hooked in with Bloomberg saying, we're gonna register, then we're gonna confiscate.
[01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:51.704]  And the crowd cheering, that video is coffin nails politically to these people.
[01:29:51.724 --> 01:29:54.425]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:55.346 --> 01:29:58.248]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:59.261 --> 01:30:02.083]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.986 --> 01:30:07.908]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:30:07.928 --> 01:30:09.869]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:30:10.089 --> 01:30:15.573]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:30:15.813 --> 01:30:19.596]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:30:19.856 --> 01:30:23.619]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:30:23.799 --> 01:30:24.980]  The fact is, you are.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:25.961]  We all are.
[01:30:26.201 --> 01:30:28.543]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:37.191]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:30:37.391 --> 01:30:38.592]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:30:38.772 --> 01:30:41.955]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:30:42.255 --> 01:30:44.517]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:30:44.637 --> 01:30:49.061]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[01:30:49.202 --> 01:30:55.107]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:30:55.347 --> 01:30:56.768]  And check out their spring specials.
[01:30:57.008 --> 01:31:03.272]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:03.512 --> 01:31:05.453]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[01:31:06.354 --> 01:31:07.354]  I had tried everything.
[01:31:07.415 --> 01:31:09.556]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:31:09.776 --> 01:31:12.478]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:31:12.898 --> 01:31:17.381]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:31:17.741 --> 01:31:24.105]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.

[01:33:25.165 --> 01:33:26.085]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:26.925 --> 01:33:28.245]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:29.126 --> 01:33:30.526]  We are here live.
[01:33:31.286 --> 01:33:36.728]  The news websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:36.888 --> 01:33:38.508]  I am your host again Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.228 --> 01:33:48.911]  David Knight and Jakari Jackson are in studio here with me right now and they went to the Mayor Bloomberg sponsored and run Trader Convention.
[01:33:50.291 --> 01:34:03.186]  A few days ago and then Arte Civeda went up to be with Obama and Biden as one of their poster people calling for restrictions of the Second Amendment and Councilman Mike Martinez said to people that had signs saying no gun ban, stop gun ban.
[01:34:03.206 --> 01:34:04.768]  He said, hey, we're not going to do that now.
[01:34:04.848 --> 01:34:05.929]  We're getting them registered now.
[01:34:06.730 --> 01:34:11.214]  But you're going to need that sign soon because we are going to do what's on your sign and laugh at him and the crowd cheers.
[01:34:11.815 --> 01:34:15.599]  And then I in my report that's up on Infowars.com show Feinstein saying the same thing.
[01:34:16.079 --> 01:34:18.762]  I mean, it's the disingenuousness of them.
[01:34:18.782 --> 01:34:25.248]  I want to play a clip of Biden here before we go back to the other three short clips and then go to the head of the
[01:34:27.190 --> 01:34:35.779]  The Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, who sent reporters out to the home of Piers Morgan, who has an armed response sign, meaning he has armed guards.
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:39.123]  So he uses guns to protect himself, but you shouldn't be able to.
[01:34:39.583 --> 01:34:43.067]  The all-out assault by these kleptocrats is accelerating right now.
[01:34:43.647 --> 01:34:46.991]  But here's Biden saying he's used to disinformation campaigns.
[01:34:47.031 --> 01:34:47.872]  See, Forbes,
[01:34:48.172 --> 01:34:48.692]  How the U.S.
[01:34:48.732 --> 01:34:50.553]  military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[01:34:50.813 --> 01:34:54.274]  DHS funded coarse-ass cops that'll confiscate guns from Christians.
[01:34:54.294 --> 01:34:56.595]  I mean, that's in the Colorado newspapers.
[01:34:56.775 --> 01:34:57.355]  Fox News.
[01:34:57.696 --> 01:35:00.016]  Army labeled evangelicals as religious extremists.
[01:35:00.437 --> 01:35:02.717]  I mean, the Army's training to take on Christians.
[01:35:03.278 --> 01:35:04.358]  I told you this first.
[01:35:04.798 --> 01:35:09.740]  I'm the crazy man, because I actually am freaked out knowing we've got a bunch of authoritarians taking over.
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:15.202]  This is how, they don't build a new car or a new computer or write a book to be popular.
[01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:17.343]  They take over and take your tax money.
[01:35:17.903 --> 01:35:18.203]  Okay?
[01:35:18.683 --> 01:35:20.264]  And these are authoritarians.
[01:35:20.304 --> 01:35:21.084]  These are not liberals.
[01:35:21.124 --> 01:35:23.925]  So, here's Biden going, he knows about disinformation.
[01:35:24.286 --> 01:35:27.027]  There's no plan to use Secret Service on sheriffs.
[01:35:27.327 --> 01:35:28.507]  There's no New World Order.
[01:35:28.527 --> 01:35:29.308]  He just gave a speech.
[01:35:29.928 --> 01:35:32.209]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bills are being introduced all over the place.
[01:35:34.110 --> 01:35:38.852]  Where the Secret Service operates now is your state police and goes after, quote, law enforcement.
[01:35:39.372 --> 01:35:41.414]  I mean, this is all, and they're like, it's not happening!
[01:35:41.954 --> 01:35:42.695]  It's not happening!
[01:35:42.715 --> 01:35:43.656]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:35:44.297 --> 01:35:50.863]  Now the NRA is engaging in a campaign, which is, I'm not unaccustomed to, of disinformation.
[01:35:52.204 --> 01:35:53.245]  To try to scare people.
[01:35:54.056 --> 01:35:56.737]  Let me read some of the things they're saying about background checks.
[01:35:56.757 --> 01:36:09.944]  They say, quote, we, the federal government, want to put every private firearms transaction right under the thumb of the federal government and keep all those names in a massive federal register.
[01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:11.145]  They've been caught doing it before.
[01:36:11.905 --> 01:36:12.826]  Kind of scary, man.
[01:36:13.906 --> 01:36:15.987]  Black helicopter crowd really is upset.
[01:36:16.267 --> 01:36:17.368]  Even in Blacksburg, Virginia.
[01:36:18.269 --> 01:36:18.949]  But guess what?
[01:36:20.626 --> 01:36:27.352]  They want to say that universal background checks are, quote, an unworkable universal federal nightmare.
[01:36:27.712 --> 01:36:27.992]  Of course.
[01:36:28.032 --> 01:36:28.733]  Bureaucracy.
[01:36:29.293 --> 01:36:31.095]  That law-abiding citizens don't want.
[01:36:31.115 --> 01:36:31.455]  And guess what?
[01:36:31.475 --> 01:36:32.536]  They say the sun comes up.
[01:36:32.556 --> 01:36:38.541]  They say even if we get a true universal background check, it will never keep criminals from buying guns.
[01:36:39.482 --> 01:36:41.344]  None of this is true.
[01:36:43.561 --> 01:36:44.202]  Let me say something.
[01:36:44.322 --> 01:36:47.384]  And I guess there's another clip I saw last night where he was talking about the Secret Service stuff.
[01:36:47.404 --> 01:36:48.666]  So they're just running around.
[01:36:48.706 --> 01:36:49.006]  Go ahead.
[01:36:49.366 --> 01:36:51.448]  It's not the NRA that's saying that, necessarily.
[01:36:51.508 --> 01:36:53.090]  It's the ACLU.
[01:36:53.190 --> 01:36:59.976]  No friend of the Second Amendment is saying that these background checks and this registry that they're setting up is really wrong.
[01:37:00.596 --> 01:37:01.277]  Unconstitutional.
[01:37:01.297 --> 01:37:04.380]  It's the ACLU that's saying that, as well as the NRA.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:05.441]  I know, but the thing is...
[01:37:06.521 --> 01:37:08.483]  How long, they're not getting away with this.
[01:37:08.503 --> 01:37:09.804]  I was about to say, how long can they get away with it?
[01:37:10.144 --> 01:37:12.886]  Everyone knows that they make Bill Clinton look honest.
[01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:16.950]  I mean, the lying level of this group, it's just a bunch of criminals.
[01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:25.176]  It's like Akron, where the Project Veritas goes in, and they go, I want to run underage kids as slaves, sex slaves.
[01:37:25.216 --> 01:37:26.137]  Oh, we're here to help you.
[01:37:26.577 --> 01:37:30.440]  And he goes to, I mean, it's just, and he goes to group after group and they say that.
[01:37:30.641 --> 01:37:30.861]  Oh yeah.
[01:37:30.961 --> 01:37:33.243]  I mean, it's just full-on criminals.
[01:37:33.752 --> 01:37:36.014]  Yeah, they said, we'll help you, just don't tell anybody that we did.
[01:37:36.034 --> 01:37:37.715]  And it's completely ridiculous.
[01:37:39.136 --> 01:37:40.137]  Because they're above the law.
[01:37:40.297 --> 01:37:40.798]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:41.058 --> 01:37:43.180]  And we'll get to these last couple clips we have.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.021]  Now, our next clip is number six.
[01:37:45.101 --> 01:37:47.644]  It's Acevedo's view on gun registration.
[01:37:47.964 --> 01:37:53.128]  David Knight asked in the question, how would you feel about registering people who have never committed a criminal offense?
[01:37:53.148 --> 01:37:54.569]  So if we have that clip, we can go ahead and roll it.
[01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:57.752]  Registration of people who have not been convicted of any crime.
[01:37:58.598 --> 01:38:02.641]  Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with that because, to me, I registered my car for a reason.
[01:38:03.321 --> 01:38:10.346]  That is, so people know that's my vehicle, it belongs to me, and if anybody's found with that vehicle and it gets run, then they know there's a problem.
[01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:14.610]  When I sell my vehicle, I do what's called a lease of liability, I transfer ownership.
[01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:22.878]  Again, I know that folks really believe that if we had registration of firearms, that that's the step right before confiscation.
[01:38:22.918 --> 01:38:35.152]  And my response to that is, the day the government wants to do something silly, like go around to over 300 million Americans and take guns and 300 sets of homes with different people, they'd go house to house anyway.
[01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:58.799]  Now as far as the registration we've seen the or should I say the confiscation we've seen that in Hurricane Katrina Hurricane Katrina but we also have this article California's gun repo men have a nerve-wracking job and I'll just read this short section many states lack the ability to confiscate firearms because they don't track purchases as closely as California which requires most sales to go through a licensed dealer to be in be reported
[01:38:59.199 --> 01:38:59.740]  This is a quote.
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.424]  Very, very few states have an archive of firearm owners like we do.
[01:39:03.765 --> 01:39:05.987]  Says Wynn Mute, who helped set up the program.
[01:39:06.027 --> 01:39:10.873]  So, they're saying if we knew who had... I have CNN saying California has confiscated no guns.
[01:39:11.334 --> 01:39:17.081]  And then Don Salazar wrote an article for Infowars.com with just them taking the guns and saying we used the database to get them.
[01:39:17.321 --> 01:39:18.721]  Yeah, I mean, that's what this is right here.
[01:39:19.162 --> 01:39:19.942]  This article right here.
[01:39:20.262 --> 01:39:21.963]  California Gun Repo Men Having Nerves.
[01:39:21.983 --> 01:39:22.303]  You know what?
[01:39:22.343 --> 01:39:23.283]  This is so important.
[01:39:23.303 --> 01:39:30.945]  I want to bring you all back in in the next hour to play the first clip where Martina says, don't worry, we're going to register, then we'll get your guns.
[01:39:31.426 --> 01:39:34.947]  I want to have you back to finish up on this at the bottom of the next hour, guys.
[01:39:34.967 --> 01:39:35.847]  I'm going to go to our guest.
[01:39:36.047 --> 01:39:36.267]  OK.
[01:39:36.367 --> 01:39:36.727]  Amazing.
[01:39:36.747 --> 01:39:37.588]  Great job, gentlemen.
[01:39:37.608 --> 01:39:42.789]  And we'll have this all together in one big report on the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central, that I'm hosting.
[01:39:42.829 --> 01:39:44.290]  And one of you guys is doing the interview, right?
[01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:45.110]  Who are you interviewing tonight?
[01:39:46.363 --> 01:39:49.744]  I believe we're talking about the Paul Revere interview, so it's my understanding.
[01:39:49.804 --> 01:39:50.364]  Oh, good, good.
[01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:50.984]  That'll be awesome.
[01:39:51.264 --> 01:39:52.224]  All right, great job, gentlemen.
[01:39:52.244 --> 01:39:55.605]  We're going to have the reporters back in there after we take calls for the first 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:39:55.625 --> 01:40:05.827]  I want to bring up James O'Keefe now of theprojectveritas.org, and in a minute we'll play him this clip of the Austin City Council members saying, first we're going to register, then we're going to take your guns.
[01:40:06.527 --> 01:40:10.188]  But when I was talking to them about a month ago, I said, somebody ought to go out to Piers Morgan's house
[01:40:10.788 --> 01:40:12.689]  And see if, you know, he's got any bodyguards.
[01:40:12.729 --> 01:40:13.669]  And sure enough, he does.
[01:40:14.029 --> 01:40:22.892]  And he has Armed Response, which is a company that promises within five minutes to have an armored truck pull up with guys, you know, with semi-automatic assault rifles and handguns.
[01:40:23.232 --> 01:40:26.713]  And sure enough, he's got that sign that guns protect his home.
[01:40:26.774 --> 01:40:28.134]  Just amazing hypocrisy.
[01:40:28.154 --> 01:40:30.055]  And of course, none of the media picked it up.
[01:40:30.135 --> 01:40:31.455]  InfoWars.com covered it.
[01:40:31.715 --> 01:40:32.956]  DrugsReport.com covered it.
[01:40:32.976 --> 01:40:33.976]  WorldNetDaily covered it.
[01:40:34.236 --> 01:40:36.297]  DrugsReport, of course, you know, picked up our story.
[01:40:36.637 --> 01:40:39.318]  But, James, good to have you back with us, my friend.
[01:40:40.046 --> 01:40:41.249]  Great to be back with you, Alex.
[01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:49.827]  What do you think of just the all-out hysterical assault on the Second Amendment and the unprecedented level of just lying about everything you're seeing and hearing?
[01:40:50.876 --> 01:40:57.240]  I think it's, as I was on your show last time, we talked about how they would not put a gun on their lawn that says, this home is proudly gun-free.
[01:40:57.781 --> 01:41:04.926]  But now we're finding, you know, we're finding armed response security system signs on the property of Piers Morgan's.
[01:41:05.006 --> 01:41:06.627]  This is his Beverly Hills property.
[01:41:07.347 --> 01:41:16.934]  And we actually confronted Piers Morgan in the street outside of his CNN headquarters and asked him if he would be willing to help sign a pledge to remove guns from movies.
[01:41:17.754 --> 01:41:21.642]  If movies, if any movie led to the death of any young child.
[01:41:22.123 --> 01:41:29.437]  So what I'm seeing is just that the people who want to take guns away are not willing to apply that to their own personal lives.
[01:41:31.135 --> 01:41:34.816]  Now we're going to roll some of this video for TV viewers out there that you guys shot.
[01:41:34.856 --> 01:41:36.656]  It's up at your Project Veritas site.
[01:41:37.276 --> 01:41:40.117]  People want to see the whole thing, which I suggest they do, and share it.
[01:41:40.677 --> 01:41:43.458]  But for radio listeners, describe what your team did.
[01:41:43.778 --> 01:41:50.139]  Describe how you got the image of the fact that he has the sign saying he has an armed response security system.
[01:41:50.379 --> 01:41:54.040]  I mean, this is classic over-the-top hypocrisy.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:42:00.642]  Yeah, this was this was in a very, very expensive area, Beverly Hills.
[01:42:01.502 --> 01:42:09.865]  And we called the armed security response systems company that's on the side to determine exactly what it means to be armed.
[01:42:10.565 --> 01:42:12.246]  And she wouldn't give me too much information.
[01:42:12.266 --> 01:42:18.888]  This is the spokesperson, but she did say that there is the option to have private armed security show up.
[01:42:19.868 --> 01:42:22.669]  If the response is triggered, if the alarm is triggered.
[01:42:23.129 --> 01:42:26.271]  So it is definitely the height of hypocrisy.
[01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:35.474]  It's not a surprise, you know, most of these journalists are very anti-gun in their messaging, but in their personal lives they turn out to be pretty pro-gun actually.
[01:42:36.074 --> 01:42:42.760]  So, I think we need to be doing more of just exposing the media's hypocrisy because it is the media that is doing this.
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:47.284]  Yeah, I need to put you in contact with a group that has surveillance footage of Piers Morgan.
[01:42:47.344 --> 01:42:50.807]  I have the footage, but I haven't run it past legal.
[01:42:50.887 --> 01:42:53.510]  Legal's normally myself, but I wanted to have it checked before I did anything.
[01:42:53.530 --> 01:42:54.511]  Well, we've had it about a month.
[01:42:55.051 --> 01:43:01.156]  It's Piers Morgan behind the scenes shooting guns, talking about how much he'd love to live in Texas and have guns like this.
[01:43:02.057 --> 01:43:07.300]  It's high def surveillance footage of him and I just haven't released it yet.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.461]  I guess I've now released the fact that we have that footage.
[01:43:11.282 --> 01:43:12.042]  There's no end to it.
[01:43:12.062 --> 01:43:12.403]  I'm sorry.
[01:43:12.443 --> 01:43:12.743]  Go ahead.
[01:43:13.308 --> 01:43:15.689]  No, it's funny you're saying legal.
[01:43:15.729 --> 01:43:18.691]  I mean, you know, we deal with legal issues all the time.
[01:43:18.731 --> 01:43:20.392]  We're very careful not to cross the line.
[01:43:20.492 --> 01:43:24.494]  I mean, we didn't release Piers Morgan's personal address, but we did look up property deeds.
[01:43:25.174 --> 01:43:31.138]  Incidentally, he's got, it seems to be, he's got a property in Calabrasas, California, Beverly Hills, California.
[01:43:31.498 --> 01:43:32.458]  He works in New York.
[01:43:33.819 --> 01:43:38.962]  Some of them are registered under different names, but this is in a very ritzy area of Beverly Hills.
[01:43:39.562 --> 01:43:42.185]  But, you know, their paycheck is more important than the principles.
[01:43:42.565 --> 01:43:45.828]  They're not willing to live up to the courage of their own principles.
[01:43:45.888 --> 01:43:49.872]  In fact, personally, in their own lives, they're very pro-gun, and then publicly they're anti-gun.
[01:43:49.912 --> 01:43:51.434]  So they're not only hypocrites, they're frauds.
[01:43:53.856 --> 01:43:57.139]  It's pretty incredible to sit there and see this unfold.
[01:43:59.502 --> 01:44:00.623]  Do you think they're going to succeed?
[01:44:00.663 --> 01:44:08.146]  They say it's razor's margin in the Senate with this bill they've got, but they've set up this idea that every time there's a new shooting, it's gun owner's fault.
[01:44:08.687 --> 01:44:16.311]  Like, every time someone gets stabbed with an X-Acto knife, like at Lone Star College in Texas, 12 people, it's the fault of anyone that owns butcher knives.
[01:44:16.391 --> 01:44:22.214]  I mean, it's just so asinine, but are they going to succeed with their war against reality?
[01:44:22.844 --> 01:44:26.185]  Well, I think that one of the things that helps them is they say that it's for the children.
[01:44:27.025 --> 01:44:33.787]  And there's a lot of sort of propaganda in the news about being for the children.
[01:44:33.807 --> 01:44:36.128]  They're always talking about children.
[01:44:36.148 --> 01:44:41.989]  And that's one of the things I think that we frame the debate in a very interesting and different way.
[01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:47.211]  This time around, we actually went up to these people and actually said, well, it's for the children.
[01:44:47.751 --> 01:44:49.813]  You know, edit out guns from movies.
[01:44:49.933 --> 01:44:51.735]  We're trying to make a point about the absurdity.
[01:44:52.235 --> 01:45:00.664]  But I think the fact that they frame it as for the children is really what takes it into a realm where you really can't disagree with them.
[01:45:00.684 --> 01:45:04.988]  And I think we need to be saying, you know, what we want to do is for the children.
[01:45:05.028 --> 01:45:07.310]  We need to be, you know, turning it on its head.
[01:45:09.052 --> 01:45:11.034]  But it's definitely out of control.
[01:45:12.381 --> 01:45:19.465]  Our story is up at DrugsReport.com right now, for anybody that would like to go there, under the image of the former Congressman Weiner.
[01:45:20.326 --> 01:45:25.229]  Police confiscating firearms from people taking anti-anxiety medication.
[01:45:25.309 --> 01:45:35.776]  Now they're saying, and then the State House is talking about this, and of course that's the model of the country, New York, for gun confiscation, as they've bragged, that they are going to go after everybody's
[01:45:36.716 --> 01:45:37.817]  I don't think so.
[01:45:56.852 --> 01:45:57.252]  You're asking me?
[01:46:21.997 --> 01:46:33.289]  I don't know what exactly they're preparing for, but I think the priority for us right now, the priority for citizen journalists, is to take it directly to the media.
[01:46:33.349 --> 01:46:36.433]  Take it directly to Piers Morgan's front lawn.
[01:46:36.673 --> 01:46:40.056]  Take it directly outside of his office in Time Warner in New York.
[01:46:40.497 --> 01:46:44.041]  Take the fight right to these journalists because they control the message.
[01:46:44.261 --> 01:46:45.262]  Because they're not journalists.
[01:46:45.282 --> 01:46:46.122]  They're not journalists.
[01:46:47.623 --> 01:46:57.630]  They were assaulting one or two pro-gun guys in Austin, and then on the news said they caused a problem at the anti-gun rally, and then they said we're going to register... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:46:57.710 --> 01:46:59.051]  It's just they're so deceptive.
[01:46:59.071 --> 01:47:01.052]  I mean, they're the bad guys, is my point.
[01:47:01.072 --> 01:47:02.613]  That's what people don't seem to understand.
[01:47:02.693 --> 01:47:09.818]  I mean, yes, there's a lot of government fraud and lying going on, but I think the priority is to take it directly to
[01:47:10.638 --> 01:47:24.088]  The journalists take it to their doorsteps, take it to their companies, point out the hypocrisy in their personal lives and that will ultimately discredit them and it will have a huge impact on any legislative battle because the media owns the message.
[01:47:24.568 --> 01:47:30.593]  So I think that the priority of Project Veritas is to highlight the hypocrisy of the journalists themselves.
[01:47:30.933 --> 01:47:32.334]  There needs to be more people doing that.
[01:47:33.074 --> 01:47:39.099]  People don't, I don't think they underestimate the power of our media, the power of the hypocrites at CNN and these other places.
[01:47:39.679 --> 01:47:43.769]  Well, I mean, CNN and all the media numbers that come out every month show this.
[01:47:44.331 --> 01:47:45.594]  All of the dominant media.
[01:47:46.778 --> 01:47:47.778]  Is no longer dominant.
[01:47:47.858 --> 01:47:49.939]  They're a shadow of their former self.
[01:47:49.999 --> 01:47:53.481]  I mean, Larry King, 15 years ago, had 10 million viewers some nights.
[01:47:53.921 --> 01:47:55.602]  When he left, it was a million and a half.
[01:47:55.682 --> 01:47:58.383]  And now, Piers Morgan's lucky if he gets a half mil.
[01:47:58.923 --> 01:48:00.944]  And I guess we just don't put on airs.
[01:48:00.964 --> 01:48:02.565]  Your videos are seen millions of times.
[01:48:03.005 --> 01:48:06.866]  My films have been seen hundreds of millions of times, just on YouTube alone.
[01:48:08.047 --> 01:48:09.648]  I reach a million people an hour.
[01:48:09.748 --> 01:48:12.649]  That, by the way, is a very conservative number, because I want to be conservative.
[01:48:13.349 --> 01:48:15.890]  3 million a day, 15 million a week, one way or another.
[01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:23.994]  I mean, these, maybe I should dress in royal robes and wear a crown, like these people basically do, because they are the mouse that roared.
[01:48:24.634 --> 01:48:27.816]  Well, they still have a lot of power, ABC, NBC, CBS News.
[01:48:28.396 --> 01:48:42.122]  They still, they still carry an ampliphone, and a megaphone, and I think that, you know, a lot of people, they do watch our videos, they do get the message, but a lot of other people are just sort of, you know, still watching network news.
[01:48:43.002 --> 01:48:49.227]  Sure, but what I'm saying is, yes, you're right, they still have power if they all gang up and say the same thing in the same order.
[01:48:49.448 --> 01:48:50.729]  But even that's not working.
[01:48:50.769 --> 01:48:58.195]  I mean, you've seen the White House publicly admitting that, quote, drudge is, quote, causing them to not even be able to talk to anybody.
[01:48:58.435 --> 01:49:01.898]  I mean, one website has got them literally crapping their pants.
[01:49:02.452 --> 01:49:05.435]  That's right, but I think a lot of people are afraid.
[01:49:05.495 --> 01:49:07.557]  There's a lot of citizen journalists.
[01:49:07.617 --> 01:49:09.859]  Drudge was a pioneer, but a lot of them are afraid.
[01:49:10.359 --> 01:49:13.702]  I think we've got to stick together and break stories.
[01:49:13.742 --> 01:49:16.044]  They've got to force the media to talk.
[01:49:16.444 --> 01:49:23.311]  The way that I've found with our stories, to force the media to talk about what we're doing, and force them to cover it, is to talk about the media.
[01:49:23.391 --> 01:49:24.492]  It's to expose the media.
[01:49:25.132 --> 01:49:33.264]  And expose the fraud like we did at NPR, like we did with the Catch a Journalist series, like we did with the recent signs on the lawns of journalists like Piers Morgan.
[01:49:33.765 --> 01:49:40.475]  Go after, investigate the journalists, and you will, I think you'll break through that media firewall and actually get onto some of these mainstream programs.
[01:49:40.555 --> 01:49:41.917]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:49:42.057 --> 01:49:45.120]  That's what they're afraid of, is you exposing the man behind the curtain.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:59.656]  And that's what the White House, in memos and in public statements, some of them came out last week, I'm sure you saw that, where the main, you know, Chief Advisor to Obama said, we can't control the narrative, and then he used Drudge as kind of a catch-all, as the top of the pyramid.
[01:49:59.676 --> 01:50:01.739]  I mean, it shows they're not all powerful.
[01:50:03.357 --> 01:50:04.697]  They're not all powerful.
[01:50:04.717 --> 01:50:05.517]  There are cracks.
[01:50:05.658 --> 01:50:08.498]  There are cracks in their messaging system.
[01:50:08.518 --> 01:50:10.719]  But what you have to do is you have to force a consequence.
[01:50:11.099 --> 01:50:13.639]  You have to... And some of your reporting has.
[01:50:14.699 --> 01:50:18.020]  Reporting has got to force a government reaction.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.240]  And that government reaction we picked up in the wires.
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:21.661]  That's what we do at Project Veritas.
[01:50:21.701 --> 01:50:24.441]  We did voter fraud investigations all last year.
[01:50:24.461 --> 01:50:25.862]  It forced investigations.
[01:50:25.882 --> 01:50:27.202]  And they tried to put you in prison.
[01:50:27.915 --> 01:50:34.559]  They tried to issue criminal grand jury subpoenas against me for exposing the fact that the Attorney General's ballot was offered to a complete stranger.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:42.825]  They've tried to issue criminal grand jury subpoenas when I exposed dead people, where ballots were given out in the names of dead people in places like New Hampshire.
[01:50:42.845 --> 01:50:53.852]  But what happened, which is interesting, is that the states, is that a couple states, changed their laws and then forced the media to report on the fact that the laws are being changed.
[01:50:53.932 --> 01:50:54.373]  That's right.
[01:50:54.853 --> 01:50:58.596]  They dragged their heels because they don't want to talk about these, they don't want to talk about the facts.
[01:50:58.696 --> 01:51:00.918]  They want to deny it while they get their takeover done.
[01:51:00.938 --> 01:51:10.225]  Stay there, let's come back and talk more about how to get on the offensive with Mr. O'Keefe of the... Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:51:10.886 --> 01:51:13.828]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:51:13.908 --> 01:51:22.235]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:51:22.865 --> 01:51:27.808]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:52:02.638 --> 01:52:03.619]  Protect your immune system.
[01:52:03.899 --> 01:52:04.940]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:52:05.601 --> 01:52:07.522]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:52:07.542 --> 01:52:09.784]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:52:09.944 --> 01:52:15.167]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:52:15.367 --> 01:52:19.129]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:52:19.389 --> 01:52:23.131]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:52:23.291 --> 01:52:24.472]  The fact is, you are.
[01:52:24.672 --> 01:52:25.452]  We all are.
[01:52:25.693 --> 01:52:28.014]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:52:28.314 --> 01:52:36.598]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:52:36.799 --> 01:52:38.019]  Be prepared before you need it.

[01:52:41.641 --> 01:52:43.882]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[01:53:05.093 --> 01:53:07.814]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:13.736]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body?
[01:53:13.857 --> 01:53:17.598]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[01:53:17.838 --> 01:53:20.659]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:22.140]  I don't know.
[01:53:39.562 --> 01:53:51.765]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful, in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[01:53:52.105 --> 01:53:53.666]  It is One World Whey.
[01:53:54.106 --> 01:53:54.526]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:54.586 --> 01:53:54.766]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:54.786 --> 01:53:55.626]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:53:55.646 --> 01:53:56.167]  That's OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:54:10.084 --> 01:54:27.862]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have to control myself to not literally become crazed on air.
[01:54:34.778 --> 01:54:42.363]  And it's because I'm the type of guy who's real laid-back fishing, laid-back with my wife and my kids, real calm my whole life, until somebody starts something with me.
[01:54:43.164 --> 01:54:45.245]  And then I turn into an absolute maniac.
[01:54:45.766 --> 01:54:46.806]  I mean, it's just my instincts.
[01:54:47.347 --> 01:54:51.650]  You come over and punch me in the nose, you may kick my butt, but you better get ready to be attacked 110%.
[01:54:54.005 --> 01:54:55.046]  You know, blackout time.
[01:54:55.667 --> 01:55:01.673]  And that's why I start hyperventilating and yelling and screaming because these people are a bunch of lying crooks, butchering everything.
[01:55:01.693 --> 01:55:03.715]  And I'm sick of them.
[01:55:04.536 --> 01:55:05.457]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:55:05.517 --> 01:55:08.881]  And I'm tired of all their memos saying they're going to ban our guns once they register them.
[01:55:09.081 --> 01:55:10.002]  They've done it all over the world.
[01:55:10.022 --> 01:55:11.323]  They've done it in New York, Chicago.
[01:55:11.343 --> 01:55:15.348]  And then I send my crew out to the anti-gun Bloomberg thing here in Austin.
[01:55:16.434 --> 01:55:35.780]  And they've got the mayor of Proteum up there that flies around with the globalists, with the police chief who was with Obama and Biden yesterday, saying, as they had people slap and hit and grab, we showed the video earlier, the reporters, the citizen activists that are out there with a sign saying,
[01:55:37.162 --> 01:55:37.983]  No gun ban.
[01:55:38.743 --> 01:55:41.605]  And then the news says the pro-gun people caused the disturbance.
[01:55:41.645 --> 01:55:42.425]  They lie about that.
[01:55:42.445 --> 01:55:44.947]  And then they say no one wants your guns in the newscast.
[01:55:45.147 --> 01:55:47.468]  And actually show Martinez, who said, hey, your sign?
[01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:51.571]  We're not taking your guns now, but after we finish this work, we are.
[01:55:52.291 --> 01:55:56.714]  And then we're going to get your guns.
[01:55:56.774 --> 01:55:57.855]  So you're going to need that sign.
[01:55:57.895 --> 01:55:58.395]  Here's the clip.
[01:55:58.455 --> 01:56:04.679]  I want to get James O'Keefe's comment on this and talk about what's coming up next with the ProjectVeritas.org.
[01:56:04.719 --> 01:56:05.039]  Here it is.
[01:56:05.535 --> 01:56:08.096]  Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez.
[01:56:08.116 --> 01:56:13.077]  Thank you so much.
[01:56:13.117 --> 01:56:21.019]  I've got a proclamation on behalf of the Mayor and City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[01:56:21.779 --> 01:56:27.961]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[01:56:37.952 --> 01:56:40.893]  And he's somebody that's called for taking the guns.
[01:56:40.953 --> 01:56:42.154]  That's from a larger report I did.
[01:56:42.174 --> 01:56:43.734]  James, what do you say to that?
[01:56:43.834 --> 01:56:48.897]  Where they'll admit they want to get the guns but then they lie on the news and say, oh we don't want your guns, we come in peace.
[01:56:49.722 --> 01:56:51.783]  I would go to that guy.
[01:56:51.803 --> 01:56:56.846]  I mean, you know, Saul Linsky would say, a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.
[01:56:56.926 --> 01:57:08.311]  But when it comes to that guy, I'd love to go to his house and offer one of our This Home is Proudly Gun-Free signs and see if he'd be willing to live up to his own book of rules.
[01:57:08.811 --> 01:57:10.112]  I doubt he'd be willing to do that.
[01:57:11.073 --> 01:57:14.694]  Now, I know a little bit about the Martinez family from folks I know.
[01:57:14.734 --> 01:57:15.815]  Reportedly, they pack the heat.
[01:57:17.295 --> 01:57:20.476]  But I guess he just wants our guns.
[01:57:20.856 --> 01:57:21.956]  He wants the only guy with a gun.
[01:57:23.557 --> 01:57:28.218]  He probably wants to, you know, a lot of these people, it's guns for me, but not for these.
[01:57:28.278 --> 01:57:31.038]  So it's really about aristocracy.
[01:57:31.599 --> 01:57:33.959]  It's about the elites versus the people.
[01:57:34.779 --> 01:57:35.820]  And exactly.
[01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:37.500]  So we need to expose that.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:45.402]  Our reporters need to expose the aristocracy, the elitism, and the disconnect between the people in power and the people who aren't.
[01:57:46.124 --> 01:57:47.244]  I know you're always doing big stuff.
[01:57:47.284 --> 01:57:48.065]  What's coming next?
[01:57:48.945 --> 01:57:51.866]  We've got about five major investigations.
[01:57:51.886 --> 01:57:53.286]  We've got something on Bloomberg.
[01:57:53.486 --> 01:57:55.207]  We're working on some federal programs.
[01:57:56.467 --> 01:57:57.988]  Some other stuff I can't even talk about.
[01:57:58.008 --> 01:58:00.949]  I mean, I'm going to be releasing a book in June.
[01:58:00.969 --> 01:58:02.609]  It's called Breakthrough.
[01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:07.611]  It is an adventure story about all the things we've done, all the various
[01:58:09.111 --> 01:58:10.252]  We're good to go.
[01:58:31.187 --> 01:58:33.468]  To break stories that actually get covered by the mainstream.
[01:58:33.488 --> 01:58:37.169]  So Saul Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer, How to Use Deception and Evil.
[01:58:37.209 --> 01:58:37.869]  They use that.
[01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:41.250]  You're writing a handbook, How to Use Good, dedicated to God.
[01:58:41.290 --> 01:58:43.031]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds with our guest.
[01:58:46.472 --> 01:58:48.313]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:56.365 --> 01:59:04.612]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:59:04.913 --> 01:59:08.356]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.

[02:00:01.245 --> 02:00:04.106]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:10.651 --> 02:00:11.291]  Big Brother.
[02:00:11.951 --> 02:00:13.012]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:13.733 --> 02:00:14.973]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:15.494 --> 02:00:16.294]  You want answers?
[02:00:17.075 --> 02:00:17.935]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:18.616 --> 02:00:22.218]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:22.798 --> 02:00:26.881]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:43.049 --> 02:00:47.911]  You know, I know that James O'Keefe knows Glenn Beck, but on the show a lot, and I think Glenn Beck does a lot of good work.
[02:00:48.752 --> 02:00:49.992]  My wife calls me this morning.
[02:00:50.653 --> 02:01:03.819]  I'm driving into work about 9 a.m., and she goes, hey, I just tuned into Glenn Beck on local radio, on your local affiliate, and he's talking about how they're going to take everybody's guns who's ever been on any type of anti-anxiety medication.
[02:01:03.879 --> 02:01:06.720]  I said, yeah, that's our story from last night.
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:10.082]  So I pulled over, and I already knew.
[02:01:11.075 --> 02:01:13.276]  And I went to Drudge, and there was our article.
[02:01:13.296 --> 02:01:14.937]  It's on Drudge right now, middle column.
[02:01:15.937 --> 02:01:23.140]  And I tune in, and he's reading it, still, this is like three minutes later, going back to pieces, not saying it's from InfoWars.com.
[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:25.861]  And, you know, here's the deal.
[02:01:27.001 --> 02:01:28.902]  And in not saying it came from DrudgeReport.com.
[02:01:29.743 --> 02:01:33.724]  My issue, maybe I missed it, but it's just, it's anytime I tune in.
[02:01:34.624 --> 02:01:38.566]  We don't copy him, he copies us, which I don't mind if he didn't attack us.
[02:01:38.626 --> 02:01:40.527]  See, I've got James O'Keefe on here,
[02:01:41.778 --> 02:01:43.582]  Because I just want a future for my kids.
[02:01:44.143 --> 02:01:45.265]  I think the guy's a hero.
[02:01:45.385 --> 02:01:46.788]  I think he's a model for all of us.
[02:01:46.808 --> 02:01:47.810]  Like, we are changes.
[02:01:49.198 --> 02:01:50.779]  And I've done this trailblazing work.
[02:01:50.899 --> 02:01:52.461]  Copy us and do it better.
[02:01:53.081 --> 02:01:54.162]  This is how we're going to beat them.
[02:01:54.182 --> 02:01:58.246]  That's why when his book comes out, I'm going to buy thousands of them and sell them on InfoWars.com.
[02:01:58.767 --> 02:01:59.487]  I'm ranting here.
[02:01:59.507 --> 02:02:00.969]  I don't mean to go off into a Glenn Beck thing.
[02:02:01.029 --> 02:02:05.934]  It's just that we need more people to fight this tyranny because these are real authoritarians.
[02:02:06.294 --> 02:02:12.220]  Knowing them as good as you do, knowing how criminal they are, do you think I'm wrong in saying this is really a dangerous group of people?
[02:02:13.394 --> 02:02:15.456]  No, Alex, I've lived it.
[02:02:17.417 --> 02:02:26.426]  There are a number of us who've lived through it, but I've been detained, I've been sued, I've been slandered, I've gotten defamation settlements from journalists.
[02:02:26.486 --> 02:02:29.809]  I've been through just about everything you can go through in your 20s.
[02:02:30.490 --> 02:02:36.055]  And what I've learned is that the most important thing is to keep going, is to not stop.
[02:02:37.957 --> 02:02:42.722]  I mean, I'm a Christian guy, so I'm not worried.
[02:02:42.922 --> 02:02:45.064]  I'm just trying to expose things.
[02:02:45.125 --> 02:02:48.328]  What we don't have enough of is we don't have fact finders.
[02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:51.211]  And that's what, you know, Drudge is great.
[02:02:51.271 --> 02:02:53.573]  He links to news stories, new information.
[02:02:53.613 --> 02:02:57.076]  You put out one fact, it seems like it gets consumed by so many different blogs.
[02:02:57.577 --> 02:03:00.180]  So my message is to get citizen journalists
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:06.763]  To go out there and not be afraid and expose new information, new content.
[02:03:07.203 --> 02:03:08.443]  We need more content.
[02:03:08.804 --> 02:03:11.165]  We have plenty of distribution platforms.
[02:03:11.245 --> 02:03:13.366]  Now we just need new content.
[02:03:13.526 --> 02:03:15.266]  And that's what my book is going to be about.
[02:03:15.366 --> 02:03:18.608]  It's going to be about how to survive the machine and make a difference.
[02:03:19.248 --> 02:03:24.030]  Hey, all the things you've learned, all the knowledge, transferring it to others, invaluable.
[02:03:24.490 --> 02:03:26.191]  I'm telling you, I'm excited to read the book.
[02:03:26.231 --> 02:03:29.152]  That's why I'm thumbing at the mouth.
[02:03:29.172 --> 02:03:34.014]  It's actually, you know like the Saul Linsky's Rules for Radicals, you said he dedicated it to Lucifer.
[02:03:34.374 --> 02:03:38.956]  In many ways, I kind of, you know, half-heartedly dedicate this book to Saul Linsky.
[02:03:39.296 --> 02:03:44.318]  Because I've learned a lot from people like Saul Linsky and these community organizers.
[02:03:44.338 --> 02:03:45.198]  They used to organize
[02:03:46.679 --> 02:03:52.921]  People for power, you know, to overturn the republic, the democratic idea.
[02:03:53.462 --> 02:03:59.705]  And what I'm doing is using those same community organizing tactics to organize like-minded citizen journalists for power.
[02:04:00.005 --> 02:04:01.586]  And you're using the truth instead of lies.
[02:04:01.606 --> 02:04:02.806]  Well, see, I haven't read your book yet.
[02:04:02.826 --> 02:04:03.807]  You're going to send me a copy.
[02:04:04.207 --> 02:04:10.070]  I mean, I guess there's not even copies out there yet, but you notice I peered into what was happening because I get what you're saying.
[02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:12.471]  Maybe if you still have time to change the foreword,
[02:04:13.271 --> 02:04:16.755]  You know, make the joke about dedicated to Saul Alinsky, but no, not really.
[02:04:17.095 --> 02:04:18.457]  He dedicated it to Lucifer.
[02:04:18.537 --> 02:04:19.518]  He used lies.
[02:04:20.359 --> 02:04:21.340]  We're using truth.
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.101]  I dedicate this to Jesus Christ.
[02:04:23.922 --> 02:04:25.464]  That's a very good idea.
[02:04:25.504 --> 02:04:29.688]  I'm actually finishing the acknowledgements right now, so I can add something to that.
[02:04:29.808 --> 02:04:33.012]  Well, I don't mean to be a preacher, but there's your word of knowledge, my friend.
[02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:34.353]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:04:34.373 --> 02:04:35.715]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[02:04:38.154 --> 02:04:40.816]  Hey, seriously, let's do five more minutes, or do you have to go?
[02:04:40.856 --> 02:04:41.857]  You got another interview coming up?
[02:04:42.998 --> 02:04:49.863]  Actually, I just have to... I got a couple of my guerrilla journalists in the field right now doing some videos, so I have to advise them.
[02:04:50.284 --> 02:04:51.525]  So I'm going to call them at two o'clock.
[02:04:51.845 --> 02:04:52.245]  Absolutely.
[02:04:52.265 --> 02:05:01.993]  All right, we'll get to that, and then we're going to have you back very soon to talk more about what's going on, because I know you're going to be breaking big news on... We're going to be breaking stories all the next few months, so I'll be sure to keep... On Turdberg.
[02:05:02.233 --> 02:05:03.654]  Or, I'm sorry, Bloomberg.
[02:05:03.674 --> 02:05:04.255]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:04.275 --> 02:05:04.655]  Thanks, buddy.

[02:08:34.248 --> 02:08:37.709]  We're here live, and I am waging war on the globalists.
[02:08:37.729 --> 02:08:44.811]  They work for foreign banks that openly announced they're establishing an authoritarian, tyrannical world government.
[02:08:45.832 --> 02:08:55.634]  Financial Times of London, their editor years ago, four years ago, wrote, and now for world government, and said, you bet we're secretive, you bet we're authoritarian, and we're smarter than you, and we're gonna run your life.
[02:08:56.155 --> 02:08:57.415]  And you know what the whole plan is?
[02:08:58.683 --> 02:09:05.306]  Bring in world government, cut off the resources, so they can socially engineer you and your family, get rid of the family.
[02:09:05.746 --> 02:09:07.947]  You'll all live in these government dormitories.
[02:09:09.647 --> 02:09:17.690]  Basically, it's a bunch of nobodies who can't win in a normal society, being good-looking, smart, hard-working, funny, inventive.
[02:09:18.271 --> 02:09:19.451]  They form gangs.
[02:09:20.091 --> 02:09:24.033]  Because it doesn't matter if a bunch of mangy hyenas are nothing compared to a big lion.
[02:09:24.847 --> 02:09:27.149]  You get about 20 of them, they can kill any lion they want.
[02:09:27.509 --> 02:09:28.430]  And that's what this is.
[02:09:29.251 --> 02:09:41.722]  That's what this whole thing is throughout history, is you've got people in gangs, and people that gravitate towards gangs, government gangs, police gangs, corporate gangs, bureaucratic gangs, and you've got a bunch of foreign offshore banks.
[02:09:43.614 --> 02:09:44.575]  People say, how do you fight them?
[02:09:44.835 --> 02:09:52.120]  Go look at who gives money to Handgun Control Incorporated, the Violence Policy Center, and then all the other big foundations that fence it out to them.
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:54.442]  The Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation.
[02:09:55.062 --> 02:09:56.043]  Go look at what they're for.
[02:09:56.183 --> 02:09:56.843]  End the family.
[02:09:57.103 --> 02:09:58.484]  Get rid of national sovereignty.
[02:09:58.865 --> 02:10:01.927]  Open the borders completely up to bring in groups that are clients of the government.
[02:10:02.387 --> 02:10:07.454]  I wouldn't be against 50 million people from Mexico if they were loving George Washington's Second Amendment private property.
[02:10:07.934 --> 02:10:09.556]  Because it's the content of the minds.
[02:10:10.177 --> 02:10:14.482]  I don't care if every Californian moves to Texas, except they flee what they've done there.
[02:10:14.502 --> 02:10:17.606]  Because I'd say California's prettier than Texas on average.
[02:10:17.646 --> 02:10:18.908]  I'd love it if it was like Texas.
[02:10:18.928 --> 02:10:19.589]  I'd probably live there.
[02:10:19.949 --> 02:10:20.790]  But it's a hellhole!
[02:10:21.601 --> 02:10:28.005]  And then you come here, you've already pooped in your pool there, now I'm in the pool in Texas and you're squatting, crapping all over us.
[02:10:28.285 --> 02:10:29.686]  And I'm like, listen, you're crapping in the pool.
[02:10:29.706 --> 02:10:31.907]  They're like, no I'm not, while I'm watching them do it.
[02:10:32.267 --> 02:10:34.549]  Listen, get it through your bug-eyed brain, okay?
[02:10:34.829 --> 02:10:37.590]  You're not gonna suck us dry like Russia and Nazi Germany.
[02:10:37.891 --> 02:10:39.251]  Get it through your stinking brain.
[02:10:39.491 --> 02:10:43.314]  I know you're cowards and weak, so you lust after power because you've never had it, okay?
[02:10:44.352 --> 02:10:47.454]  You don't even know what you're getting into, okay?
[02:10:47.474 --> 02:10:48.755]  Because you're weak idiots.
[02:10:49.315 --> 02:10:53.858]  The useful idiots always open up the bridge, the drawbridge, and open the gate for the enemy to come in.
[02:10:54.578 --> 02:10:57.140]  And you know the first people the enemy slits the throats of?
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:00.001]  They don't want a traitor that'll open the gate for the next person.
[02:11:00.201 --> 02:11:02.943]  They despise you, Mike Martinez.
[02:11:03.383 --> 02:11:05.044]  They despise you.
[02:11:05.605 --> 02:11:07.586]  And the globalists all hate each other as well.
[02:11:08.541 --> 02:11:13.422]  I mean, they've written about it at these Bilderberg and Davos and Bohemian Grove meetings.
[02:11:13.442 --> 02:11:16.662]  They're all a bunch of backstabbing mafia crud.
[02:11:17.463 --> 02:11:18.223]  Dishonorable.
[02:11:18.303 --> 02:11:20.743]  That's why they want to corrupt society so you're dishonorable.
[02:11:21.003 --> 02:11:26.324]  Because if you're not dishonorable, then society will be strong and they can't overrun you.
[02:11:28.184 --> 02:11:33.986]  And I'm not an honorable person because I've got some goody-two-shoes idea.
[02:11:34.406 --> 02:11:36.246]  I'm honorable because it makes sense.
[02:11:37.642 --> 02:11:39.664]  Let me tell you, this is a dishonorable world now.
[02:11:39.844 --> 02:11:41.065]  Wickedness is spreading.
[02:11:41.325 --> 02:11:44.668]  And I don't mean the wickedness the preacher talks about, and he's a goody two-shoes and a fake.
[02:11:45.369 --> 02:11:47.711]  Okay, I know about wickedness because my heart is wicked.
[02:11:48.071 --> 02:11:49.472]  Very wicked, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:49.713 --> 02:11:51.254]  But the good in me is even stronger.
[02:11:51.494 --> 02:11:54.197]  And I can tell you, not just their political actions, but all of it.
[02:11:54.397 --> 02:12:00.182]  I've been around the so-called Democratic Party, and who they are, they are the authoritarian scum of the earth.
[02:12:00.382 --> 02:12:01.663]  Does that mean the Republicans are good?
[02:12:01.703 --> 02:12:03.605]  No, they're controlled by the very same globalists.
[02:12:05.393 --> 02:12:10.596]  What I'm getting at here is that we are in a crisis and these are bad people.
[02:12:10.816 --> 02:12:22.423]  How do you know if you're walking down an alleyway at night and you see some really scary people looking at you in an aggressive way and in a predatory way and you know they're stalking you and they sure enough say, what time is it, buddy?
[02:12:22.443 --> 02:12:28.487]  And then if you're dumb enough to, because they're looking for somebody that'll go up against the wall, I'm your friend, mind if I have your wallet?
[02:12:28.507 --> 02:12:29.547]  Because then it's not even stealing.
[02:12:29.567 --> 02:12:30.248]  He gave it to me.
[02:12:31.075 --> 02:12:36.740]  I mean, I've been on the New York subway in the morning and at night when they're doing that to an old lady.
[02:12:39.864 --> 02:12:42.446]  And, you know, it doesn't even matter.
[02:12:43.647 --> 02:12:44.448]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:12:44.488 --> 02:12:47.351]  The point is, is that I don't want to live under this bondage.
[02:12:47.431 --> 02:12:48.512]  You don't want to live under it.
[02:12:48.852 --> 02:12:50.233]  Find your common sense.
[02:12:50.970 --> 02:12:52.030]  Find out what's happening.
[02:12:52.090 --> 02:12:55.531]  I'm going to have him with us for the rest of the hour here today.
[02:12:55.571 --> 02:12:56.872]  Jakari Jackson and David Knight.
[02:12:56.892 --> 02:13:00.473]  We just had James O'Keefe on from the Veritas Project.
[02:13:01.013 --> 02:13:01.973]  And we're taking action.
[02:13:02.693 --> 02:13:03.874]  And let me tell you, it's exciting.
[02:13:03.954 --> 02:13:04.574]  It's bold.
[02:13:04.854 --> 02:13:06.535]  People play video games for adventure.
[02:13:06.955 --> 02:13:08.815]  They go and jump out of airplanes for adventure.
[02:13:09.135 --> 02:13:11.176]  They go and do all this stuff looking for the adventure.
[02:13:11.216 --> 02:13:14.817]  The adventure is always about defending liberty and freedom.
[02:13:15.397 --> 02:13:17.738]  So you can go out and write the books you want to write.
[02:13:18.118 --> 02:13:20.200]  So you can go out and be the journalist you want to be.
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:23.422]  So you can go out and worship the God you want to worship.
[02:13:23.703 --> 02:13:32.010]  So you can go out and build the business and the idea you want without some big cartel having government shut you down because you didn't go through the right process.
[02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:34.211]  You know what you've got to do to get drugs approved nowadays?
[02:13:34.452 --> 02:13:35.753]  You've got to go pay off U.S.
[02:13:35.793 --> 02:13:39.556]  military generals to get them to fast-track human testing on U.S.
[02:13:39.596 --> 02:13:40.897]  troops for anything.
[02:13:41.457 --> 02:13:42.999]  I don't know people in drug development.
[02:13:43.544 --> 02:13:43.744]  Okay?
[02:13:44.165 --> 02:13:46.907]  You go pay off generals, and it's all legal.
[02:13:47.267 --> 02:13:54.853]  You pay them off and their advisory board that's got congressmen on it, and then they all get a piece of the drug and then it gets approved, even if it kills people.
[02:13:55.334 --> 02:13:56.595]  That's how America works.
[02:13:56.635 --> 02:13:58.817]  You hear, oh, we can't get the drugs approved.
[02:13:58.957 --> 02:14:02.560]  They've got warehouses of treatments and near cures for everything.
[02:14:03.621 --> 02:14:05.542]  They have found the cures for cancer.
[02:14:05.562 --> 02:14:07.003]  99% of the time.
[02:14:07.023 --> 02:14:07.264]  There's no 100%.
[02:14:09.912 --> 02:14:10.752]  There's complications.
[02:14:10.772 --> 02:14:13.213]  They've got all of it, and they're going, we've got all this.
[02:14:13.413 --> 02:14:14.953]  We've got all this incredible technology.
[02:14:15.134 --> 02:14:16.894]  We've got antimatter power systems.
[02:14:16.934 --> 02:14:17.554]  That's been leaked.
[02:14:18.014 --> 02:14:18.955]  They've got everything!
[02:14:19.495 --> 02:14:21.515]  And they're going, well, we don't need all these people.
[02:14:21.555 --> 02:14:25.937]  Look at their ugly eating hamburgers and stumbling around, tattoos all over them.
[02:14:26.277 --> 02:14:27.797]  You're the ones that did that to them.
[02:14:28.217 --> 02:14:29.878]  You're the ones that sold them a culture.
[02:14:29.898 --> 02:14:31.238]  I'm not saying you're bad if you have tattoos.
[02:14:31.258 --> 02:14:31.778]  You know my point.
[02:14:32.078 --> 02:14:33.079]  To destroy you.
[02:14:34.099 --> 02:14:37.442]  So that you would be weak, so that they could run over you.
[02:14:37.802 --> 02:14:43.927]  Eugenics isn't get rid of the bad, build up the good, which is evil in itself, because you know where that goes.
[02:14:44.427 --> 02:14:54.695]  Real eugenics, when you get deep into it, is about targeting the strong, the beautiful, the creative, because you are a threat to them, just like a lion will kill a baby male lion.
[02:14:54.715 --> 02:14:56.777]  He'll come over and smell it, and then he'll eat it.
[02:14:57.217 --> 02:14:58.138]  Grizzly bears do it.
[02:14:58.758 --> 02:15:02.561]  Every predatory species does it, and make no mistake, humans are predatory.
[02:15:02.802 --> 02:15:04.903]  And so the globalists call themselves another species.
[02:15:05.284 --> 02:15:06.885]  They're above us, and they want us disarmed.
[02:15:07.205 --> 02:15:09.988]  The toll-free number to join us after we go through these clips is 800-259-9231.
[02:15:10.008 --> 02:15:10.048]  800-259-9231.
[02:15:10.068 --> 02:15:14.572]  You either wake up and get the fire of liberty burning in your heart, or get ready to be a total techno-slave.
[02:15:14.752 --> 02:15:17.174]  And, again, the end of this road isn't just slavery.
[02:15:24.844 --> 02:15:28.326]  The New World Order's got all these little jobs where you can have petty power through the system.
[02:15:28.587 --> 02:15:33.610]  But at the end of the day, it's meant to be cycled down and shut down.
[02:15:33.630 --> 02:15:34.911]  800-259-9231.
[02:15:35.331 --> 02:15:36.992]  What do you think of Mike Martinez?
[02:15:37.072 --> 02:15:39.053]  What do you think of Bloomberg?
[02:15:39.114 --> 02:15:48.220]  What do you think of these Democrats openly saying, with Republican traitors, that they are going to ban our guns once they register them?
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:49.380]  Well, we already knew that.
[02:15:49.741 --> 02:15:54.364]  It's the sneakiness of these people that should discredit them, but they always have these
[02:15:55.486 --> 02:15:58.756]  Weak, pathetic, gibbering people that look like mental patients.
[02:15:59.237 --> 02:16:01.564]  I mean, I've gone to these anti-gun rallies and it just looks like...
[02:16:02.392 --> 02:16:07.333]  Like, it doesn't matter if they're black, white, Hispanic, these people all look like Buzz Bissinger.
[02:16:07.873 --> 02:16:13.215]  I mean, they are fundamentally weirdo people who hate you and want to pull you down.
[02:16:13.255 --> 02:16:14.115]  I'm sorry I've said that.
[02:16:14.395 --> 02:16:15.255]  Gentlemen, I'm ranting.
[02:16:15.275 --> 02:16:16.435]  We're going to break here in a few minutes.
[02:16:16.455 --> 02:16:21.036]  Sha'Carri, David Knight, hearing all this, I just realized the full assault is now happening.
[02:16:21.316 --> 02:16:22.897]  The enemy is putting their full weight on us.
[02:16:22.957 --> 02:16:23.917]  This is the main assault.
[02:16:24.297 --> 02:16:25.217]  This is going to get worse.
[02:16:25.637 --> 02:16:27.378]  And this is where we decide who we are.
[02:16:27.978 --> 02:16:30.041]  And now I realize the gun owners aren't going to turn them in.
[02:16:30.361 --> 02:16:34.146]  It's going to turn into a shooting war, they're going to call gun owners terrorists, and it's off to the racists.
[02:16:34.406 --> 02:16:35.387]  How do we stop that?
[02:16:35.448 --> 02:16:36.409]  How do we avert that?
[02:16:36.689 --> 02:16:39.393]  Recap some of the other clips before we play the clips we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:16:39.593 --> 02:16:41.896]  Because you were in here with us last hour for those that don't know.
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:46.002]  Well, you talked about the big picture.
[02:16:46.482 --> 02:16:52.346]  We're going to talk about some of the details because Garcevedo is talking about registration versus confiscation.
[02:16:52.386 --> 02:16:54.167]  He's talking about, are we really on a slippery slope?
[02:16:54.187 --> 02:17:02.752]  And so we want to talk about some of those issues and what he said there and what he's calling for and what the Democrats are calling for, where that's going to lead immediately.
[02:17:04.102 --> 02:17:04.643]  Absolutely.
[02:17:05.043 --> 02:17:06.665]  Yeah and I don't know if the guys have the clip ready.
[02:17:06.725 --> 02:17:08.827]  It's clip number six if we have time to play that.
[02:17:08.847 --> 02:17:22.940]  Now let's go ahead and he's queuing that up and we're gonna... What did you think when the news, because I played that local KVUE piece where they said no one wanted to take the guns and then they edit Martinez to make it sound like he wasn't gonna take the guns.
[02:17:23.541 --> 02:17:27.205]  When he said we're gonna... I mean it's just... and I guarantee they got a pat on the back.
[02:17:27.225 --> 02:17:28.366]  Good job lying to the viewers.
[02:17:28.706 --> 02:17:40.213]  Yeah, it's definitely slight of hand because they took the clip, I can't even say they took it out of context, they just edited it in a certain way that when they play the lady saying, well I'm not trying to take anybody's guns, and maybe she isn't.
[02:17:40.333 --> 02:17:50.779]  She wants responsible gun restrictions, whatever that means to her, but then you play Martinez who says, yes I will take your guns, I'm going to make your sign legitimate because you see the guy with the sign that says, end the gun ban or no gun ban.
[02:17:51.539 --> 02:17:54.101]  Oh, I'll guarantee if she's the head of that group, she wants total abolition.
[02:17:54.141 --> 02:17:55.582]  I've run into these people behind the scenes.
[02:17:56.021 --> 02:17:59.642]  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised at that myself, because they may start with that.
[02:18:00.022 --> 02:18:05.204]  We think we can get this today, but I wouldn't be surprised if many of those people just wanted to complete abolition of firearms.
[02:18:05.264 --> 02:18:09.665]  Most of those people have been let out of mental institutions or they're in government.
[02:18:10.365 --> 02:18:11.986]  I've been to dozens of those.
[02:18:13.106 --> 02:18:14.587]  And I mean, they're all weirdos.
[02:18:14.807 --> 02:18:15.127]  Go ahead.
[02:18:15.167 --> 02:18:16.727]  We need to stop this at registration.
[02:18:17.188 --> 02:18:18.548]  And we're going to talk about why we need to do that.
[02:18:18.568 --> 02:18:19.448]  We got that clip ready.
[02:18:19.508 --> 02:18:20.049]  Let's run that.
[02:18:20.069 --> 02:18:20.849]  Yeah, let's go to that clip.
[02:18:20.869 --> 02:18:21.189]  Here it is.
[02:18:21.869 --> 02:18:24.610]  Registration of people who have not been convicted of any crime.
[02:18:25.498 --> 02:18:29.481]  Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with that, because to me, I register my car for a reason.
[02:18:29.501 --> 02:18:30.202]  This is Austin Police Chief.
[02:18:30.222 --> 02:18:37.227]  That is, so people know that's my vehicle, it belongs to me, and if anybody's found with that vehicle, and it gets run, then they know there's a problem.
[02:18:37.828 --> 02:18:40.590]  When I sell my vehicle, I do what's called a lease of liability.
[02:18:40.630 --> 02:18:41.331]  I transfer ownership.
[02:18:41.351 --> 02:18:43.853]  They use registration now to steal your car, and the government does, when you haven't paid the taxes.
[02:18:43.873 --> 02:18:49.717]  I know that folks really believe that if we had registration of firearms, that that's the step right before confiscation.
[02:18:49.757 --> 02:18:53.741]  And my response to that is, the day the government wants to do something silly, like go around to
[02:18:54.661 --> 02:18:59.724]  Over 300 million Americans and take guns and 300 sets of homes with different people.
[02:19:00.324 --> 02:19:02.065]  They'd go house-to-house anyway.
[02:19:02.985 --> 02:19:05.146]  So I'm not exactly sure what he was implying.
[02:19:05.226 --> 02:19:16.391]  No, no, the official new army manuals for house-to-house gun confiscation, they get it in Katrina and they're already taking guns in all these states that are banning them and arresting people for over 10 round mags with felonies.
[02:19:16.431 --> 02:19:17.252]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:19:17.472 --> 02:19:19.473]  But they do want to know who has the guns.
[02:19:20.153 --> 02:19:20.973]  Of course they do.
[02:19:21.453 --> 02:19:22.014]  They admit that.
[02:19:23.154 --> 02:19:36.124]  But listen to the analogy that he's making because this is all over a lot of people's signs that of course had been prepared for the crowd before they got there and that was this analogy of automobiles to guns and registration of automobiles to registration of guns.
[02:19:36.565 --> 02:19:38.106]  That's not the analogy we're talking about.
[02:19:38.186 --> 02:19:40.828]  We're talking about a First Amendment type of analogy.
[02:19:40.848 --> 02:19:43.270]  You need to compare the Second Amendment to the First Amendment.
[02:19:43.590 --> 02:19:45.231]  The First Amendment says you'll make no law.
[02:19:45.511 --> 02:19:47.492]  The Second Amendment says you shall not infringe.
[02:19:47.532 --> 02:19:54.375]  And the only difference between those two is they understood they were going to come after the Second Amendment gradually, incrementally, around their edges, okay?
[02:19:54.395 --> 02:19:56.636]  And that's exactly what this registration stuff is.
[02:19:56.656 --> 02:19:57.557]  It's an infringement.
[02:19:57.817 --> 02:20:00.899]  And then they say at the rally, we're going to ban your guns after we register them.
[02:20:01.159 --> 02:20:04.080]  And the news spins it and says, relax, relax.
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:05.061]  This isn't an assault.
[02:20:05.201 --> 02:20:05.621]  Lay down.
[02:20:06.161 --> 02:20:08.083]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:20:08.103 --> 02:20:10.345]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:20:10.505 --> 02:20:16.490]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:19.692]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:20:19.953 --> 02:20:23.696]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:20:23.856 --> 02:20:25.037]  The fact is, you are.
[02:20:25.237 --> 02:20:26.018]  We all are.
[02:20:26.258 --> 02:20:28.580]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:37.164]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[02:20:37.364 --> 02:20:38.584]  Be prepared before you need it.

[02:21:06.809 --> 02:21:12.211]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[02:21:12.811 --> 02:21:13.911]  That's closer than you think.
[02:21:14.652 --> 02:21:20.454]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[02:21:20.834 --> 02:21:28.757]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[02:21:29.557 --> 02:21:35.099]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[02:21:35.839 --> 02:21:36.860]  But here's some good news.
[02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:46.066]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[02:21:46.707 --> 02:21:55.513]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[02:21:55.974 --> 02:22:00.017]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[02:22:00.177 --> 02:22:01.678]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[02:22:05.262 --> 02:22:12.285]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[02:22:34.401 --> 02:22:35.482]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:35.642 --> 02:22:40.025]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:40.225 --> 02:22:45.929]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:46.029 --> 02:22:49.431]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:49.671 --> 02:22:52.273]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.493 --> 02:22:57.296]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:57.436 --> 02:22:57.677]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.717 --> 02:22:59.078]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:04.521 --> 02:23:06.161]  Chicago is a virtual battlefield.
[02:23:06.281 --> 02:23:10.422]  More than 500 shooting deaths in 2012 have made Chicago the murder capital of America.
[02:23:10.542 --> 02:23:12.023]  Proof a gun control doesn't work.
[02:23:12.083 --> 02:23:15.184]  Disarming law-abiding citizens ensures that only criminals have guns.
[02:23:15.364 --> 02:23:18.484]  And Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Machine want to keep it that way.
[02:23:18.644 --> 02:23:21.325]  If we can't stop them in Chicago, we may lose the whole battle.
[02:23:21.405 --> 02:23:22.005]  But there's hope.
[02:23:22.205 --> 02:23:28.046]  On April 9th, we have a chance to send billionaire Mike Bloomberg, Rahm Emanuel, and his Chicago Machine a crystal clear message.
[02:23:28.267 --> 02:23:30.247]  That we have a natural right to defend ourselves.
[02:23:30.407 --> 02:23:30.567]  Call 800-979-1555.
[02:23:30.587 --> 02:23:30.627]  800-979-1555.
[02:23:30.647 --> 02:23:30.967]  That's 800-979-1555.
[02:23:30.987 --> 02:23:31.027]  800-979-1555.
[02:23:59.087 --> 02:24:00.472]  Paid for by Tea Party Leadership Fund Back.
[02:24:00.513 --> 02:24:01.998]  Not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee.
[02:24:02.039 --> 02:24:03.163]  TheTeaPartyLeadershipFund.com
[02:24:15.503 --> 02:24:30.656]  Alright, in the next segment, with my two co-hosts here today, Jakari Jackson and David Knight, we will start going to your phone calls, interspersed with some of the clips we played earlier, but we were just getting into Arte Saveda saying, hey, don't worry about registration leading to confiscation.
[02:24:31.076 --> 02:24:32.077]  That's ridiculous!
[02:24:32.097 --> 02:24:33.158]  Who ever heard of that?
[02:24:33.739 --> 02:24:39.163]  Meanwhile, they just had a speech up there where the city councilman's like, hey, don't worry, first we're going to register.
[02:24:39.924 --> 02:24:41.525]  Then, your sign about gun ban?
[02:24:41.885 --> 02:24:44.067]  You're gonna need that sign, because that's what we're gonna do.
[02:24:44.507 --> 02:24:53.652]  And then the crowd's all laughing and cheering, and a woman comes up with her hand and kind of hits him in the back, and they're grabbing at his sign, and then the media's like, look at that troublemaking gun owner over there!
[02:24:54.293 --> 02:24:55.513]  And we don't want your guns!
[02:24:55.553 --> 02:24:58.235]  It's like, folks, this is military operations.
[02:24:58.295 --> 02:25:01.137]  They found in World War I. If you had speakers,
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:04.182]  Blaring, this is not an assault.
[02:25:04.322 --> 02:25:07.968]  Even though troops were coming over, the French and Germans did it back and forth on each other.
[02:25:08.428 --> 02:25:09.750]  The people wouldn't fight as hard.
[02:25:10.291 --> 02:25:13.756]  So they just... It's like in Seven Private Ryan where the German soldiers...
[02:25:14.588 --> 02:25:19.972]  You know, they're trying to stab each other and the American soldier starts getting the upper hand.
[02:25:20.212 --> 02:25:21.613]  The guy's like, oh no, let's be friends.
[02:25:22.273 --> 02:25:22.874]  Let's be friends.
[02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:23.734]  We're not fighting now.
[02:25:23.754 --> 02:25:26.216]  And the guy gives up and he's like slides that knife in.
[02:25:26.476 --> 02:25:27.497]  We don't want your guns.
[02:25:27.537 --> 02:25:28.438]  There's no bullets.
[02:25:28.478 --> 02:25:29.579]  There's nothing going on.
[02:25:29.599 --> 02:25:31.300]  There's no, the fellow reserve it in private.
[02:25:32.541 --> 02:25:32.901]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:32.941 --> 02:25:33.281]  Go ahead.
[02:25:33.521 --> 02:25:34.382]  That's exactly right.
[02:25:34.702 --> 02:25:39.645]  Now, I just want to talk a little bit about their views, you know, these people at this rally.
[02:25:40.105 --> 02:25:49.571]  You know, they just want reasonable restrictions, and one of those restrictions is to have people who have felony offenses, you know, not be able to have their right to bear arms.
[02:25:49.811 --> 02:26:01.938]  Now, to many people that may sound reasonable, they think about felonies as murder or heavy drug trafficking, but we have the article on Infowars.com about a man who was arrested, charged with felony offenses for releasing balloons.
[02:26:02.538 --> 02:26:06.181]  And you think about this, this is the new bar, or should I say the bar has been lowered.
[02:26:06.561 --> 02:26:08.422]  You can see the, yeah, you can see it right there.
[02:26:08.762 --> 02:26:11.604]  Man faces five years in prison for releasing balloons.
[02:26:11.684 --> 02:26:13.846]  And people say, that's InfoWars.com.
[02:26:14.026 --> 02:26:16.848]  Well go to the bottom and click on the Sun Sentinel newspaper.
[02:26:17.208 --> 02:26:21.511]  He's facing five to seven years for releasing three heart-shaped balloons.
[02:26:22.131 --> 02:26:23.693]  Yeah, so that's the new bar.
[02:26:24.193 --> 02:26:25.594]  For environmental crimes.
[02:26:25.694 --> 02:26:26.494]  Yeah, so if you release balloons.
[02:26:26.514 --> 02:26:29.316]  And he wouldn't be able to have guns, because he let those balloons go.
[02:26:29.336 --> 02:26:31.058]  Because he would have a felony.
[02:26:31.818 --> 02:26:32.619]  If he's charged with that.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.044]  And on that same account, we can go to clip number 7 here.
[02:26:36.384 --> 02:26:42.512]  And this is Asa Bale talking about the slippery slope of gun registration.
[02:26:42.532 --> 02:26:42.993]  There it is.
[02:26:43.594 --> 02:26:47.439]  I would really like to see an anti-gun trafficking federal law.
[02:26:47.901 --> 02:26:51.063]  The right to bear arms has been part of our nation's history.
[02:27:05.431 --> 02:27:06.572]  Huge part of our nation's history.
[02:27:06.592 --> 02:27:08.072]  It's something that we have to support.
[02:27:08.753 --> 02:27:14.816]  But we protect it by taking common sense steps to do a better job keeping guns out of the wrong people's hands.
[02:27:15.216 --> 02:27:25.841]  Over there in Colorado, in Aurora, where he's... I mean, that guy would have been nice to be able to have something where we could at least take possession of those firearms for safekeeping until they can work through their issues.
[02:27:26.567 --> 02:27:27.147]  So there you go.
[02:27:27.187 --> 02:27:36.291]  He said, I at least like to have access to those guns temporarily, pre-crime, because he had... But meanwhile, he was planning it.
[02:27:36.511 --> 02:27:38.392]  He told everyone it's going to come out in court.
[02:27:38.592 --> 02:27:42.654]  He was on seven drugs in a mind-controlled DARPA program.
[02:27:42.914 --> 02:27:46.816]  Gee, wonder why the top Air Force psych warfare specialist didn't tell the police.
[02:27:46.836 --> 02:27:49.317]  But now, because it's on record, goes, oh, well, I did.
[02:27:50.297 --> 02:27:51.618]  Oh, they never stop them.
[02:27:51.698 --> 02:27:52.519]  I wonder why.
[02:27:52.539 --> 02:27:54.860]  And Adam Lanza had his guns illegally.
[02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:56.641]  He tried to buy guns five times.
[02:27:57.162 --> 02:27:57.442]  Oh yeah.
[02:27:57.702 --> 02:27:58.963]  But look at what Acevedo is doing.
[02:27:59.183 --> 02:28:01.225]  He's doing the typical Democrat talking points.
[02:28:01.425 --> 02:28:07.209]  He comes out and he says, we want you to have, we only want to take guns away from criminals, people who are convicted felons.
[02:28:07.309 --> 02:28:12.973]  We're going to give them due process and then they shouldn't have guns anymore because they've been judged to be dangerous to the community.
[02:28:13.233 --> 02:28:17.115]  And like Jakari just pointed out, a felony is not what you think of as a felony.
[02:28:17.155 --> 02:28:19.417]  It could be releasing a couple of balloons on the beach.
[02:28:19.817 --> 02:28:20.297]  He's backing away.
[02:28:20.317 --> 02:28:20.978]  They say he assaulted them.
[02:28:39.346 --> 02:28:40.948]  Yeah, and then they say that he spit on them.
[02:28:40.968 --> 02:28:43.591]  You can see the guy, the police are wrestling him to the ground.
[02:28:43.631 --> 02:28:48.237]  He has his hands up like this, you know, like, I'm not resisting, and they try to slam him to the ground.
[02:28:48.658 --> 02:28:51.321]  A pretty pathetic attempt, if I might add so myself.
[02:28:51.701 --> 02:28:58.330]  But, uh, they're trying to slam the guy to the ground, and he said, I'm not resisting, but, you know, now they're trying to charge him with felonies for filming police.
[02:28:58.570 --> 02:28:59.931]  And then they'll get his guns, don't worry.
[02:29:00.211 --> 02:29:01.832]  And Acevedo supported that.
[02:29:01.892 --> 02:29:05.975]  He supported the officers who were lying, okay, and he pushed for maximum charges on this guy.
[02:29:06.015 --> 02:29:12.819]  And it's always, oh we love the veterans, the truth is they hate him because he's an army ranger, you know, from Iraq and Kosovo.
[02:29:14.022 --> 02:29:14.202]  Yeah.
[02:29:14.242 --> 02:29:14.882]  We'll show you.
[02:29:14.902 --> 02:29:15.663]  Yeah.
[02:29:15.943 --> 02:29:17.983]  But it's exactly, you know, what we're talking about.
[02:29:18.003 --> 02:29:22.045]  They're taking a fundamental right and they're turning it into a government-granted privilege.
[02:29:22.405 --> 02:29:26.806]  And first he tells people, don't worry, we're only going to take rights away from convicted felons.
[02:29:27.086 --> 02:29:31.408]  But then later he turns it to anybody that a psychiatrist points a finger at.
[02:29:31.448 --> 02:29:32.708]  And that's what they're calling for.
[02:29:32.848 --> 02:29:38.230]  They have a bill in the Texas legislature where the police just say they think you're acting mentally ill and your guns are gone.
[02:29:38.470 --> 02:29:38.830]  Exactly.
[02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:40.571]  I mean, that's Soviet Union.
[02:29:40.911 --> 02:29:44.092]  But it's okay, because Arne Seveda's so nice.
[02:29:44.392 --> 02:29:46.633]  Oh, he's a friendly guy.
[02:29:46.813 --> 02:29:47.753]  He is a friendly guy.
[02:29:48.254 --> 02:29:48.834]  I'll give him that.
[02:29:49.134 --> 02:29:49.974]  He is a friendly guy.
[02:29:49.994 --> 02:29:51.255]  Just don't turn your back on him.
[02:29:52.195 --> 02:29:52.955]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:55.236 --> 02:29:56.137]  We're on the march.

[02:33:29.378 --> 02:33:30.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.

[02:33:33.932 --> 02:33:37.936]  We're just seeing a rampage of authoritarianism out there on every front.
[02:33:37.996 --> 02:33:39.618]  So many fronts I can't even keep track of it.
[02:33:39.638 --> 02:33:43.361]  We're going to go to Dean, Paul, Kent, Mark, Sean and others here in a moment.
[02:33:43.381 --> 02:33:47.025]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:47.085 --> 02:33:48.847]  Gentlemen, let's get to some more of these clips.
[02:33:48.867 --> 02:33:49.808]  What's up next, Jakari?
[02:33:50.208 --> 02:33:54.529]  Well actually we have the last clip and I'll let David introduce this one because he actually asked the question.
[02:33:55.209 --> 02:33:57.790]  Well basically we just wanted to see if he's having trouble getting ammunition.
[02:33:58.070 --> 02:34:03.972]  There's reports, it was actually linked to Drudge I think two or three days ago where they're talking about police departments couldn't get ammunition.
[02:34:04.292 --> 02:34:06.573]  The Tennessee Highway Patrol couldn't get ammunition.
[02:34:07.073 --> 02:34:12.514]  The lead story was some police department where they're putting off their qualification because they couldn't get sufficient ammunition.
[02:34:12.534 --> 02:34:17.516]  So I asked Art Acevedo if the Austin Police Department was having any trouble getting ammunition.
[02:34:17.556 --> 02:34:18.076]  Here's what he said.
[02:34:18.476 --> 02:34:19.777]  One quick question.
[02:34:20.337 --> 02:34:22.338]  Are you having any trouble getting ammunition?
[02:34:22.358 --> 02:34:23.158]  No, actually, no.
[02:34:24.459 --> 02:34:30.462]  So when we heard that, we went out and we looked around Austin to see if we could buy any ammunition from sporting goods stores.
[02:34:30.502 --> 02:34:31.382]  Slim pickings.
[02:34:31.562 --> 02:34:32.042]  Yeah.
[02:34:32.082 --> 02:34:33.143]  And that piece is tonight.
[02:34:34.304 --> 02:34:35.104]  No, it'll be tomorrow night.
[02:34:35.384 --> 02:34:35.844]  Tomorrow night.
[02:34:36.084 --> 02:34:41.447]  And to be clear, I was in an academy about a month ago buying ammo and
[02:34:41.707 --> 02:34:47.032]  You have to go to the front register to get one box of 223, 308, or 40, or 9, all the government stuff.
[02:34:47.292 --> 02:34:50.955]  And I was told by the guys behind the counter, well, trucks come in, there's guys waiting.
[02:34:51.015 --> 02:34:51.976]  Sometimes it's the police.
[02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:53.117]  We try to help them out.
[02:34:53.397 --> 02:34:57.922]  You found one article out of East Texas where the gun shop said they give cops preferential treatment.
[02:34:58.302 --> 02:35:03.426]  So I sent you over there to see, A, let's show people there's real, because I told Watson about this, like,
[02:35:04.224 --> 02:35:08.488]  Actually, it was a month and a half ago before anybody had the news that they were rationing ammo.
[02:35:08.688 --> 02:35:10.009]  And for whatever reason, he's a great writer.
[02:35:10.029 --> 02:35:11.110]  He had too much on his plate.
[02:35:11.631 --> 02:35:12.371]  Now it's news.
[02:35:12.431 --> 02:35:15.454]  But I was there at Academy, and then I called around at other academies.
[02:35:15.474 --> 02:35:16.535]  They go, no, you get one box.
[02:35:16.855 --> 02:35:18.497]  You guys experienced that same thing, correct?
[02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:20.570]  Oh yeah, we did some hidden camera stuff.
[02:35:20.770 --> 02:35:21.911]  I believe we all went out.
[02:35:22.031 --> 02:35:26.273]  I went to one of the academies here in Austin, and I go to the front counter.
[02:35:26.293 --> 02:35:32.877]  Well, first I go back to the gun bar, and you know, they're more the desired ammunition, your .223s, your 9mms, they kept those up front.
[02:35:33.197 --> 02:35:38.320]  So I go back up front to the customer service desk, and I say, hey, do you have any .223s?
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:41.021]  They say, yes, but you can only buy one box.
[02:35:41.041 --> 02:35:41.962]  I was like, okay.
[02:35:42.302 --> 02:35:43.203]  So I pull out my money,
[02:35:44.003 --> 02:35:48.924]  And the guy behind the cashier girl, he said, well, you can buy two if you have somebody else buy one.
[02:35:49.265 --> 02:35:52.425]  But the cashier girl is telling me, no, this is our last box.
[02:35:52.786 --> 02:35:56.247]  So I'm like, OK, do you have one box or can I buy two if I'm with somebody else?
[02:35:56.847 --> 02:35:59.067]  Then the guy says, OK, OK, just let the guy buy two.
[02:35:59.087 --> 02:36:00.928]  I only had enough money for one, so I just bought one.
[02:36:01.988 --> 02:36:04.289]  That was that Remington boar killer, 223.
[02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:07.670]  Yeah, that's the one you saw we have back there in the office.
[02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:12.651]  So, I mean, it definitely is bullet rationing and even they resort to the point of lying to you.
[02:36:13.091 --> 02:36:18.072]  If you go in there and you want to get more than one box, just instead of saying, sir, you're going to get one box, like, no, this is our last bottle.
[02:36:18.092 --> 02:36:21.113]  See, I was told more because there was three guys and I bought a couple shotguns.
[02:36:21.983 --> 02:36:25.884]  And one guy was shaking, because it was me, and they go, don't worry, he's just a weekend guy.
[02:36:26.525 --> 02:36:34.107]  And of course, all these listeners come up shaking my hand, and I go, okay, I want that shotgun, and I want that shotgun, because you can't ever have enough shotguns, semi-autos.
[02:36:34.607 --> 02:36:36.248]  And the guy's going, you can't have two!
[02:36:36.508 --> 02:36:37.708]  You can't have two!
[02:36:38.148 --> 02:36:39.829]  And I'm, and I'm, and I'm... Why can't you buy two?
[02:36:39.929 --> 02:36:43.850]  Well, he goes, we gotta fill out an ATF report, you know, that, where you buy two rifles.
[02:36:44.370 --> 02:36:45.791]  And the manager goes, no, we don't.
[02:36:46.511 --> 02:36:49.934]  And I'm going, well now tell me, how do I get 223 more than just one box?
[02:36:49.954 --> 02:36:53.297]  He goes, well, we were selling it right out of the truck to whoever got there first.
[02:36:53.337 --> 02:36:54.778]  We tried to help the police out first.
[02:36:55.218 --> 02:36:58.641]  So I think Acevedo, maybe he's getting from the feds, Homeland Security.
[02:36:58.741 --> 02:37:00.222]  He's certainly got connections.
[02:37:00.703 --> 02:37:02.744]  He's up all week talking to Biden.
[02:37:02.784 --> 02:37:05.727]  And he's not just standing behind him, he's on the news with the Vice President.
[02:37:05.987 --> 02:37:06.768]  Yeah, he was very calm.
[02:37:06.788 --> 02:37:08.771]  He said, oh, I have no problems getting ammunition.
[02:37:08.871 --> 02:37:09.612]  El Diablo!
[02:37:09.752 --> 02:37:15.019]  We've seen the articles in other organizations, police organizations, where they're having trouble getting ammunition.
[02:37:15.059 --> 02:37:18.143]  Some gun stores are even making their own now, just to supply.
[02:37:18.644 --> 02:37:22.929]  And we have to understand, too, we touched on it at the very end of the, just before the break, but
[02:37:23.490 --> 02:37:37.762]  The argument that he's using, the standard Democrat talking points is, don't worry, we're only coming after dangerous felons, and they've had due process, but then as they talk, they spin it and say, and anybody that a psychiatrist deems to be dodgy, a little bit dodgy.
[02:37:37.802 --> 02:37:43.746]  So now it's not a court, it's the psychiatrist-psychologist that are public drug reps, pushing drugs on kids.
[02:37:43.786 --> 02:37:49.271]  Their answer is, all our Prozac heads keep shooting everybody up, so now let's put more people on it.
[02:37:49.551 --> 02:37:52.834]  And you lose due process, and not only does that person lose due process,
[02:37:53.314 --> 02:37:56.197]  But everybody in the household loses due process.
[02:37:56.217 --> 02:37:57.798]  Remember there was that story that we covered?
[02:37:58.339 --> 02:38:00.901]  I don't remember where it was, but the kid had... The water gun.
[02:38:01.021 --> 02:38:01.622]  The water gun.
[02:38:01.662 --> 02:38:04.464]  And they went in and confiscated the dad's guns.
[02:38:04.544 --> 02:38:05.605]  Well that was on Monday.
[02:38:05.645 --> 02:38:08.989]  The bullies are beating him up so they joke, we could squirt him with water guns.
[02:38:09.629 --> 02:38:10.770]  I brought water guns to school.
[02:38:11.131 --> 02:38:11.711]  You name it.
[02:38:11.871 --> 02:38:13.233]  We threw footballs at each other all day.
[02:38:13.253 --> 02:38:14.013]  I mean, you know, whatever.
[02:38:14.093 --> 02:38:15.174]  Of course, they banned dodgeball.
[02:38:15.294 --> 02:38:16.295]  There it is right there on the screen.
[02:38:16.315 --> 02:38:16.856]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:38:16.916 --> 02:38:17.857]  And they come to the house and they go,
[02:38:18.277 --> 02:38:21.379]  When he moves out when he's 18, the kid's 10, you can have your guns back, maybe.
[02:38:22.199 --> 02:38:23.680]  Yeah, took $6,500 worth of guns from him.
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:26.021]  Just confiscated them.
[02:38:26.041 --> 02:38:29.343]  No judge, no jury, no nothing, just the police are gone.
[02:38:29.623 --> 02:38:34.285]  Because they had registration information on him, they knew that he had a gun.
[02:38:34.485 --> 02:38:36.806]  Because there were other kids, they didn't go after the other family.
[02:38:36.826 --> 02:38:37.947]  And again, that's Long Island.
[02:38:38.307 --> 02:38:41.789]  So the issue here is, they just do whatever they want now.
[02:38:42.409 --> 02:38:43.971]  I mean, there's not even a law to do that.
[02:38:44.251 --> 02:38:46.393]  And they want that nationwide, just color of law.
[02:38:46.613 --> 02:38:48.375]  Folks, tyranny is when they do whatever they want.
[02:38:48.996 --> 02:38:49.557]  And it's here.
[02:38:49.597 --> 02:38:57.645]  And by the way, you notice they're announcing, we're going to take the federal pension funds to prop up the derivatives now, and we're going to take your 401k now, or part of it.
[02:38:58.126 --> 02:38:58.526]  And you know what?
[02:38:58.546 --> 02:39:03.792]  There is that new thing on investments, that new extra tax, and there is that payroll tax on poor people.
[02:39:04.412 --> 02:39:04.552]  Right.
[02:39:06.260 --> 02:39:08.964]  I mean how long can they get away with this level of con artistry?
[02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:21.560]  We're good to go.
[02:39:42.540 --> 02:39:49.106]  In the last three, four years, the city managers and three or four other key people, some of them getting paid $800,000 a year in even small towns that's come out in California.
[02:39:49.906 --> 02:39:52.108]  Doesn't somebody in California make more money than Obama?
[02:39:52.609 --> 02:39:52.829]  No, no.
[02:39:53.109 --> 02:39:55.071]  There's a city manager in a small town that made $800,000.
[02:39:55.111 --> 02:39:55.311]  Why not?
[02:39:55.371 --> 02:39:57.733]  I mean, they can do whatever they want.
[02:39:57.913 --> 02:40:00.035]  Guys, type in, California bureaucrats paid $800,000.
[02:40:00.115 --> 02:40:01.516]  It was like $844,000.
[02:40:02.577 --> 02:40:08.923]  But the point is, they've quietly moved into other private pension funds that they know have been protected.
[02:40:09.483 --> 02:40:11.745]  And they're going to loot everybody else's.
[02:40:12.025 --> 02:40:17.689]  I mean, you cops following these criminals' orders, you really think you're going to take our guns and not have everything you've got taken?
[02:40:17.709 --> 02:40:22.313]  I mean, Mexico has triple the resources in major studies you can look up that the U.S.
[02:40:22.333 --> 02:40:22.573]  does.
[02:40:22.773 --> 02:40:25.956]  Oil, gold, timber, soils, volcanic.
[02:40:26.396 --> 02:40:30.019]  I mean, the whole thing, except for a little bit of the north, is the best soil in the world.
[02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:37.345]  And Mexico, Mexico can't get anything going because the El Jefes don't want people doing well.
[02:40:38.561 --> 02:40:39.582]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:40:40.883 --> 02:40:44.606]  There it is, who reportedly had a combined salary of $1.6 million.
[02:40:45.647 --> 02:40:53.654]  Oscar Hernandez, the mayor of Bell, California, and the city council accepted the resignation of the city manager Robert Rizzo, assistant city manager Angela
[02:40:54.673 --> 02:40:55.334]  How do you say that?
[02:40:55.414 --> 02:41:02.421]  Spasisa and Police Chief Randy Adams, who reportedly had a combined salary of 1.6 mil.
[02:41:02.681 --> 02:41:04.263]  And see, that's not even the worst one.
[02:41:04.523 --> 02:41:08.767]  People in California finally went, you're taking my house for property taxes because I can't pay it?
[02:41:08.787 --> 02:41:10.249]  Is that a medical issue or whatever?
[02:41:10.589 --> 02:41:11.570]  And the insurance won't cover it?
[02:41:11.810 --> 02:41:14.172]  You're taking my house and you make $800,000 a year in a town of 50,000 people?
[02:41:14.273 --> 02:41:15.153]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[02:41:19.824 --> 02:41:20.805]  That's exactly how it works.
[02:41:21.125 --> 02:41:22.667]  And we've already seen precedents of this.
[02:41:22.807 --> 02:41:28.232]  In Illinois, they had the teacher's union, and the teacher's employees had a state pension.
[02:41:28.452 --> 02:41:31.715]  And of course, the state comes in and borrows against it to the hilt.
[02:41:32.135 --> 02:41:38.361]  And that was one of the things that they came in and said, let's try to, they actually voted, the teachers actually voted to have private pensions.
[02:41:38.641 --> 02:41:43.346]  So they would actually have an account with their name on it, and they could, and they had transparency to see what was there.
[02:41:43.586 --> 02:41:45.528]  But now they're going to come after the private pensions.
[02:41:46.138 --> 02:41:47.099]  And they're not going to borrow it.
[02:41:47.539 --> 02:41:49.441]  Well, look at Europe in the final orgy.
[02:41:49.661 --> 02:41:53.204]  They're going after the billionaires now who aren't on the inside group and taking all their money.
[02:41:53.425 --> 02:41:56.207]  And it turns out the really insider guys are all tax exempt.
[02:41:56.808 --> 02:41:57.068]  Oh yeah.
[02:41:57.408 --> 02:42:03.954]  Because they're giving you a haircut while they just rip money out of your account and it's amazing to me that people don't think that it can happen here.
[02:42:04.174 --> 02:42:07.037]  Notice the first week they reported on it and now you never hear about it again?
[02:42:07.197 --> 02:42:07.377]  Right.
[02:42:09.179 --> 02:42:10.080]  They took 100% of some accounts.
[02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:10.200]  Yeah.
[02:42:11.937 --> 02:42:12.477]  Because why not?
[02:42:12.497 --> 02:42:13.478]  They got away with 10 percent.
[02:42:13.758 --> 02:42:15.219]  Because there's no guns in Cyprus.
[02:42:15.299 --> 02:42:16.080]  Only the government has them.
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:18.241]  And I've talked to folks that have been to Cyprus.
[02:42:18.702 --> 02:42:20.082]  It's highly paramilitary.
[02:42:20.603 --> 02:42:22.124]  You know, soldier cops with machine guns.
[02:42:22.144 --> 02:42:22.924]  But you don't have them.
[02:42:23.165 --> 02:42:23.685]  And guess what?
[02:42:23.725 --> 02:42:24.886]  You don't have your bank account either.
[02:42:24.906 --> 02:42:25.606]  Wow.
[02:42:26.167 --> 02:42:35.032]  Alright, I want to go to some phone calls, but we never got to clip number two, which I guess is a repeat of Martinez and I guess Art Acevedo.
[02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:40.956]  I think the biggest thing is that they went out and intimidated the two guys with pro-gun signs.
[02:42:42.017 --> 02:42:43.798]  A lady hits him in the back.
[02:42:44.859 --> 02:42:46.060]  It's weird, and I love women to death.
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:46.580]  They're heckling.
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:47.461]  It's weird how women will hit you.
[02:42:47.481 --> 02:42:48.642]  They'll kind of just like, eh, like that.
[02:42:48.662 --> 02:42:50.883]  And she like, pow, with her fingers, hits him.
[02:42:51.184 --> 02:42:52.525]  And then they cuss at him.
[02:42:52.565 --> 02:42:54.066]  And then he's bad because they did that.
[02:42:54.366 --> 02:42:54.586]  Yeah.
[02:42:54.806 --> 02:42:55.807]  And they're heckling the guy.
[02:42:55.847 --> 02:43:00.870]  And I don't know if it's in that clip, but you can hear one of the ladies saying, oh, is this your bodyguard to the smaller guy?
[02:43:00.930 --> 02:43:02.051]  And they're making fun of him.
[02:43:02.111 --> 02:43:03.232]  And you can obviously see them.
[02:43:03.252 --> 02:43:04.333]  They're covering his sign.
[02:43:04.653 --> 02:43:05.514]  But they're the bad guys.
[02:43:06.474 --> 02:43:09.076]  And then Acevedo comes over and like leans into him.
[02:43:09.577 --> 02:43:09.997]  What do you think?
[02:43:10.017 --> 02:43:10.697]  This is America?
[02:43:10.717 --> 02:43:11.318]  This is Cuba?
[02:43:12.827 --> 02:43:18.293]  Well, it's key to remember what Martinez said, you know, when he got pushed and when he got his blood up.
[02:43:18.974 --> 02:43:21.757]  He said, we're going to make your gun ban sign come true.
[02:43:21.997 --> 02:43:25.201]  What's the one where Ace Veda says, I want to confront Alex.
[02:43:25.221 --> 02:43:26.142]  I'm not taking the guns.
[02:43:26.743 --> 02:43:27.744]  I don't know if we have that one.
[02:43:27.824 --> 02:43:32.750]  We need that for the nightly news with that, then cutting to all the gun grabbers saying, once we register, we're going to get them.
[02:43:32.970 --> 02:43:33.691]  OK, we'll get that.
[02:43:33.911 --> 02:43:35.232]  And the registration... And it's so fake!
[02:43:35.253 --> 02:43:36.774]  He's like, how dare Alex say that!
[02:43:37.134 --> 02:43:38.376]  It's just so fake!
[02:43:39.057 --> 02:43:46.665]  It's like you catch your... Have you ever had your kids when they're stealing candy or something, and they try that thing of acting angry, and then you see the wrapper sticking out of their pocket?
[02:43:46.705 --> 02:43:47.085]  I'm sorry.
[02:43:48.772 --> 02:43:55.355]  Well, the registration that he's proposing, that the Democrats are proposing, is bad enough, even without all-out confiscation.
[02:43:55.375 --> 02:44:09.202]  We understand it is a step to confiscation, but it is going to have immediate effect on a lot of people when you look at the way they're going around and already using registration information to grab your guns if they see something on Facebook that your son put on there about a squirt gun or something, right?
[02:44:09.222 --> 02:44:12.363]  So, you know, that's a serious step right there.
[02:44:12.483 --> 02:44:15.645]  It's changing a fundamental right into a privilege.
[02:44:15.945 --> 02:44:21.809]  But outside of law, they're kicking kids out of school for their pastry looking like a gun, or a G.I.
[02:44:21.849 --> 02:44:23.390]  Joe toy, or a Nerf gun.
[02:44:23.410 --> 02:44:25.012]  I mean, they're just doing it.
[02:44:25.072 --> 02:44:26.092]  Like he said, brainwash.
[02:44:26.393 --> 02:44:27.633]  Turn people against guns.
[02:44:27.674 --> 02:44:30.576]  Yeah, when they lock down a school because you brought your Nerf gun.
[02:44:31.136 --> 02:44:32.237]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[02:44:32.617 --> 02:44:37.740]  And we need to understand that these constitutional sheriffs that Acevedo attacked, these are elected officials.
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:38.500]  Okay?
[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:39.981]  Police chiefs are not elected.
[02:44:40.241 --> 02:44:41.282]  They're appointed bureaucrats.
[02:44:41.662 --> 02:44:41.982]  Okay?
[02:44:42.282 --> 02:44:46.645]  And like Sheriff Mack said, any gun law is illegal.
[02:44:47.025 --> 02:44:48.826]  And he did go to the Supreme Court.
[02:44:48.886 --> 02:44:52.288]  He did fight the Brady Bill, all the way to the Supreme Court, and he won.
[02:44:52.648 --> 02:44:53.508]  So they just changed it.
[02:44:53.528 --> 02:44:56.070]  You know, it's just amazing.
[02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:57.571]  We've gotten to this point.
[02:44:57.591 --> 02:44:59.093]  All right, let's go to the phone calls here.
[02:44:59.273 --> 02:45:01.615]  We're going to go to Dean and Paul, Kent, Mark, Sean.
[02:45:01.655 --> 02:45:02.837]  Thanks for calling in today.
[02:45:03.377 --> 02:45:08.082]  By the way, InfoWars Nightly News tonight, we've got one of our reporters' first pieces on the street.
[02:45:08.182 --> 02:45:08.963]  It is incredible.
[02:45:10.364 --> 02:45:15.109]  The majority of Austinites we talked to did not know what dihydrogen monoxide was.
[02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:18.733]  We've redone that piece that Penn & Teller did nine years ago, and they said, ban water.
[02:45:19.588 --> 02:45:27.352]  And then you guys are going to go out and you're going to get them to, say, ban sodium chloride and... Carbon dioxide.
[02:45:27.412 --> 02:45:28.073]  What you breathe out.
[02:45:28.093 --> 02:45:29.854]  Of course, the EPA is on board with that.
[02:45:30.074 --> 02:45:30.474]  Oh, they are?
[02:45:30.494 --> 02:45:33.476]  That's just as ridiculous as banning water, if you stop and think about it.
[02:45:33.496 --> 02:45:34.737]  Well, the plants would die.
[02:45:34.757 --> 02:45:36.318]  You know, they've done the ice core samples.
[02:45:36.358 --> 02:45:38.419]  The lowest ever recorded are carbon dioxide.
[02:45:38.999 --> 02:45:42.063]  Plants grow faster, healthier, there's more oxygen, humans live longer.
[02:45:42.563 --> 02:45:42.824]  Absolutely.
[02:45:42.844 --> 02:45:44.385]  It's almost like the Earth's losing its atmosphere.
[02:45:44.405 --> 02:45:47.769]  They think all those A-bombs and stuff they detonated, the U.S.
[02:45:47.789 --> 02:45:50.973]  military in the 60s, the upper atmosphere may have blown holes in the atmosphere.
[02:45:51.293 --> 02:45:51.794]  But that's good.
[02:45:51.814 --> 02:45:53.136]  Just say the atmosphere is bad.
[02:45:53.616 --> 02:45:53.796]  Yeah.
[02:45:54.037 --> 02:45:55.258]  I mean, just kill everybody.
[02:45:55.298 --> 02:45:55.859]  Kill babies.
[02:45:55.899 --> 02:45:57.380]  I mean, your kids don't belong to you.
[02:45:58.208 --> 02:45:59.949]  No, and I saw the tweet.
[02:45:59.969 --> 02:46:01.510]  I think we posted on InfoWars.com.
[02:46:01.530 --> 02:46:03.592]  She goes, Jesus says I love you.
[02:46:04.132 --> 02:46:06.934]  Which I'm sure he does love her, but I mean regardless.
[02:46:06.994 --> 02:46:08.295]  It's just a flippant thing.
[02:46:08.335 --> 02:46:10.196]  Your kids belong to the collective now.
[02:46:10.276 --> 02:46:12.117]  It's like you're joining the Borg.
[02:46:12.518 --> 02:46:13.999]  And then you're not allowed to even criticize her.
[02:46:14.019 --> 02:46:15.700]  She goes, I forgive my enemies.
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:17.901]  That is nothing new, though.
[02:46:18.001 --> 02:46:20.923]  That's a Ford Foundation deal where they go, I'm with Jesus.
[02:46:21.243 --> 02:46:25.725]  Yeah, but I mean that whole thing about, you know, your kids belonging to the state, that goes all the way back to Plato's Republic.
[02:46:25.825 --> 02:46:26.045]  Oh yeah.
[02:46:26.085 --> 02:46:29.107]  He wanted absolute control over everybody, and he wanted to destroy the family.
[02:46:29.147 --> 02:46:33.649]  He didn't want anyone to even know who their parents were, so the state could completely control them.
[02:46:33.689 --> 02:46:34.710]  That was his prescription.
[02:46:34.730 --> 02:46:35.931]  And that's what North Korea's done.
[02:46:35.971 --> 02:46:39.993]  And then some guys accused me for talking about the allegory of the cave that I support Plato.
[02:46:40.413 --> 02:46:42.474]  That's how dumbed down even pseudo-intellectuals are.
[02:46:42.734 --> 02:46:47.456]  If I go, it's like Plato's Allegory of the Cave, which is a really good allegory, then I support Plato.
[02:46:48.156 --> 02:46:51.417]  I mean, it's just like, I didn't ever know I was that smart.
[02:46:52.177 --> 02:46:54.018]  You guys feel like you're super smart, it's just normal.
[02:46:54.058 --> 02:46:55.879]  It's just the general public's a bunch of idiots.
[02:46:56.979 --> 02:46:58.700]  I don't know.
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:46:59.720]  Do we have the calls?
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:00.800]  Absolutely, Jakari.
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:01.221]  Look at that.
[02:47:01.861 --> 02:47:04.082]  Jakari, which means friend of callers.
[02:47:04.822 --> 02:47:06.923]  Let's go to Dean in Virginia.
[02:47:06.943 --> 02:47:07.883]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:47:09.991 --> 02:47:10.691]  Hello, Dean!
[02:47:11.191 --> 02:47:12.032]  Good thing I didn't go to him.
[02:47:12.052 --> 02:47:12.552]  He's not there.
[02:47:14.212 --> 02:47:15.392]  I wanted to hear what Dean had to say.
[02:47:15.433 --> 02:47:16.553]  John, are you there up at the network?
[02:47:18.233 --> 02:47:21.134]  Yeah, we've lost talk back to the network in Minnesota.
[02:47:21.754 --> 02:47:24.215]  So that's what that reason we may not be able to take callers.
[02:47:24.275 --> 02:47:25.655]  So see, it's magic.
[02:47:27.056 --> 02:47:28.476]  Again, Genesis, can you hear me?
[02:47:28.496 --> 02:47:29.957]  Have we even been off the air a while?
[02:47:30.837 --> 02:47:32.117]  Who even knows what's going on?
[02:47:32.697 --> 02:47:33.978]  Yeah, we're reconnecting with the network.
[02:47:34.458 --> 02:47:38.599]  And I want to hear what you have to say, Dean, so don't... Oh, the call system is locked up in here.
[02:47:39.707 --> 02:47:42.218]  So that's why we gotta keep scanning like we're air traffic controllers.
[02:47:42.700 --> 02:47:44.347]  Scanning, scanning, scanning.
[02:47:44.721 --> 02:47:46.602]  Let's talk about this constitutional sheriff stuff.
[02:47:46.642 --> 02:47:48.524]  I mean, you know, we need to get behind these sheriffs.
[02:47:49.164 --> 02:47:52.606]  We need to have someone who is going to stand with the law.
[02:47:52.987 --> 02:47:57.930]  And, you know, we don't need the Supreme Court to tell us what the meaning of not be infringed is.
[02:47:57.970 --> 02:47:59.351]  We pretty well can understand that.
[02:47:59.711 --> 02:48:11.819]  And, you know, going all the way back to when this was first, this first idea came out here, Marbury versus Madison, that's where they established the fact that they were going to have the Supreme Court review all the laws.
[02:48:12.220 --> 02:48:13.621]  That was not an established fact.
[02:48:14.221 --> 02:48:20.768]  Jefferson attacked that from the very beginning and said, if you do that, you've turned the Constitution into a suicide pack.
[02:48:21.509 --> 02:48:22.570]  Let me read a quote from him.
[02:48:22.610 --> 02:48:32.621]  He says right here, in denying the right they usurp of exclusively explaining the Constitution, and he's saying that the Supreme Court should not exclusively explain the Constitution, he says,
[02:48:33.422 --> 02:48:47.933]  Intending to establish three departments, coordinate and independent, that they may check and balance one another, it's been given according to this opinion, that is Marbury versus Madison, to one of them alone, that is the Supreme Court, the right to prescribe rules for the government of the others.
[02:48:48.613 --> 02:48:51.975]  And to that one, too, which is unelected by and independent of the nation.
[02:48:51.995 --> 02:48:59.298]  In other words, these are politically appointed judges that are going to stand over and have final say-so over every law.
[02:48:59.679 --> 02:49:03.721]  And Jefferson said that was not the checks and balances that we had for the federal government.
[02:49:04.081 --> 02:49:08.583]  Certainly isn't the checks and balances that are there with the people and with the states.
[02:49:08.723 --> 02:49:10.044]  That's what the 10th Amendment is about.
[02:49:10.084 --> 02:49:14.885]  It says rights that have not been expressly or powers that... Yeah, hey, hold on a second.
[02:49:14.925 --> 02:49:16.286]  I gotta be engineer on there too.
[02:49:16.626 --> 02:49:20.707]  Hey guys, I've lost connection to the network and I guess I need to get some intel on that.
[02:49:20.727 --> 02:49:21.648]  What's going on network?
[02:49:29.150 --> 02:49:30.551]  We're being hit by denial of service?
[02:49:32.964 --> 02:49:33.285]  All right.
[02:49:34.186 --> 02:49:36.391]  All right, well, I just want to get on the phone with you to make sure that was happening.
[02:49:36.451 --> 02:49:37.393]  All right, I'm engineer too.
[02:49:37.413 --> 02:49:38.214]  All right, thanks.
[02:49:38.395 --> 02:49:40.339]  I wonder why we can't go to the phone calls.
[02:49:41.461 --> 02:49:42.042]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:49:42.841 --> 02:49:52.383]  Well, the bottom line is, is that, you know, what Acevedo was saying when he attacked the Constitutional Sheriffs, was he was saying, you know, you have to do everything that the Supreme Court says.
[02:49:52.503 --> 02:49:56.944]  Well, the Supreme Court, and everyone at the federal level, is subordinate to the Constitution.
[02:49:57.705 --> 02:49:59.765]  Yeah, so what if we got a gang of nine?
[02:50:00.085 --> 02:50:05.327]  What if a foreign government got kids like sleeper cells, which is why we said you had to be natural born here to be president.
[02:50:05.547 --> 02:50:06.427]  That used to happen in Europe.
[02:50:06.767 --> 02:50:11.168]  What if you got a Manchurian Supreme Court that then said you have to sacrifice your children?
[02:50:11.508 --> 02:50:12.368]  On their fifth birthday.
[02:50:12.749 --> 02:50:13.949]  Oh, well that's the Supreme Court!
[02:50:14.189 --> 02:50:14.789]  Let's do that!
[02:50:14.809 --> 02:50:20.132]  I mean, it's the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, which never fully got enforced, i.e.
[02:50:20.192 --> 02:50:22.733]  slavery and stuff, until people did enforce it.
[02:50:23.333 --> 02:50:23.673]  You see?
[02:50:24.093 --> 02:50:28.835]  People say the Constitution Bill of Rights failed because they hate it, because it's the best thing ever created in history.
[02:50:28.976 --> 02:50:36.799]  And talking about the Bill of Rights, there's a lady, I'm not sure if we have it in our clips or not, but she had a sign that said, what amendment protects our children from the Second Amendment?
[02:50:37.321 --> 02:50:46.546]  And I'm like, how many times have you been saved or somebody in your family has been saved, or even if you didn't know it, just because, let's say a police officer comes up, they're not afraid of the police officer, they're afraid of the gun on his hip.
[02:50:47.107 --> 02:50:50.068]  You know, that's why when the police officer pulls out the gun, the people start running.
[02:50:50.468 --> 02:50:53.110]  But, you know, for some reason, it's the Second Amendment's fault.
[02:50:53.430 --> 02:50:53.870]  Yeah.
[02:50:53.890 --> 02:50:59.712]  Alright folks, we've got like triple redundancy backed up to the network up in Minnesota, but occasionally one of the connections cuts out, we're not aware of it.
[02:50:59.972 --> 02:51:04.913]  So that caller was probably there on air going, hello, hello, hello, and I'm just sitting there going, ooh.
[02:51:05.173 --> 02:51:05.873]  So we're gonna come back.
[02:51:06.273 --> 02:51:07.434]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:51:07.834 --> 02:51:09.574]  Instead, throw all your leftovers.
[02:51:09.674 --> 02:51:12.235]  Vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts.
[02:51:12.355 --> 02:51:13.636]  And more into the Bokashi!
[02:51:13.916 --> 02:51:21.843]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.

[02:53:05.348 --> 02:53:09.450]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:10.111 --> 02:53:12.232]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:13.141 --> 02:53:21.495]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain its world-class healer.
[02:53:22.116 --> 02:53:27.044]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:19.522]  We're going to go into overdrive a little bit with the Nightly News crew, and then we'll be back tonight.
[02:54:19.562 --> 02:54:27.487]  I'm hosting the news, but you guys are doing some of the interviews and reviewing some of the great films that are coming in on the $115,000 Paul Revere contest we're running.
[02:54:27.847 --> 02:54:33.630]  Don't forget, folks, we take the money that comes in here to get crew, research, films, to fight the globalists.
[02:54:33.670 --> 02:54:34.371]  We want to win.
[02:54:34.411 --> 02:54:35.091]  That's what we're after.
[02:54:35.131 --> 02:54:36.152]  What makes our boat float?
[02:54:37.216 --> 02:54:37.836]  Fighting tyranny.
[02:54:38.557 --> 02:54:40.338]  I mean, because the tyrants are a bunch of crooks.
[02:54:40.418 --> 02:54:43.660]  I mean, if you don't have an instinct to fight them, something's wrong with you.
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:54.146]  And so buy the books, buy the videos, buy your storable high-quality seeds from us, your high-quality storable food from InfoWarsStore.com, another great eFoods direct products.

[02:55:26.149 --> 02:55:28.550]  All right, I just got a couple points I just wanted to make.
[02:55:28.850 --> 02:55:36.372]  Just, uh, been awake for, you know, a few years now, and I've got to work every single day preaching, trying to, you know, show people.
[02:55:36.912 --> 02:55:41.793]  Just, search engine, Operation Northwoods, Gladio, Ajax, etc.
[02:55:42.133 --> 02:55:47.774]  The UN, David Spangler, no one will enter the New World Order without taking a Luciferian pledge.
[02:55:48.295 --> 02:55:49.635]  Why can't people understand
[02:55:50.239 --> 02:55:51.781]  You know, aka the New World Order.
[02:55:51.801 --> 02:55:53.404]  You know, they're taking over the planet.
[02:55:53.985 --> 02:55:59.833]  I've gone to congressional records seeing these famous quotes, and they're in there going, we will have to pay for the New World Order in blood.
[02:56:00.094 --> 02:56:01.275]  We pledged to Lucifer.
[02:56:01.295 --> 02:56:03.278]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[02:56:04.634 --> 02:56:16.165]  I was just going to say, you made that montage, I think it was last week or the week before, and people keep saying there's no new world order, and you lined up all these clips showing that all these people have called for a new world order or a world government.
[02:56:16.185 --> 02:56:18.527]  Which defines as a world government.
[02:56:18.807 --> 02:56:21.670]  And then Joe Biden goes, I want a new world order, but it doesn't exist.
[02:56:22.366 --> 02:56:22.767]  Pretty much.
[02:56:22.967 --> 02:56:23.728]  Let's look at the U.N.
[02:56:23.768 --> 02:56:24.469]  Arms Trade Treaty.
[02:56:24.689 --> 02:56:26.892]  This is something that they've been planning for quite some time.
[02:56:27.132 --> 02:56:33.260]  They had this coming up for a vote in July, but they were still really getting hit with this fast and furious scandal, right?
[02:56:33.300 --> 02:56:35.784]  So they pushed that and they said, we'll do that after the election.
[02:56:35.804 --> 02:56:37.145]  And then they ran the false flags.
[02:56:37.266 --> 02:56:37.486]  Right.
[02:56:37.566 --> 02:56:39.408]  What does your gut tell you about Sandy Hook and Aurora?
[02:56:40.049 --> 02:56:40.749]  I think they're false.
[02:56:41.070 --> 02:56:42.170]  Yeah, I think they're false flags.
[02:56:42.490 --> 02:56:44.171]  The timing was just too suspicious.
[02:56:44.452 --> 02:56:47.713]  They did that one week exactly before they were going to have the U.N.
[02:56:47.753 --> 02:56:47.974]  vote.
[02:56:48.034 --> 02:56:49.815]  Well, they should have gotten better actors, too.
[02:56:50.035 --> 02:56:52.216]  Yeah, it didn't really... It's like the worst actors I've ever seen.
[02:56:52.396 --> 02:56:59.340]  It didn't really overcome the narrative and the news that was going on with Fast and Furious, because Republicans were really hitting that for political gain just before the election.
[02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:01.201]  So they said, we're going to come back after the election.
[02:57:01.221 --> 02:57:03.342]  So abruptly, I was up there at the U.N.
[02:57:03.362 --> 02:57:06.244]  We were filming just for this very issue with another group.
[02:57:06.824 --> 02:57:09.787]  And, uh, they pulled it out abruptly, like two days before.
[02:57:09.807 --> 02:57:12.549]  They said, that's it, we're going to come back after the election.
[02:57:12.649 --> 02:57:24.319]  They came back the very day of the election, and they were ready to do this in the lame duck session if they needed to, but because Obama and the Democrats were having a good election, they said, we're going to revisit this in March, when they've got even stronger.
[02:57:24.379 --> 02:57:26.161]  And magically, what came next?
[02:57:26.761 --> 02:57:36.345]  Yeah, and the thing about Sandy Hook is, when we went out to this recent rally, we were asking Acevedo and even some other people, and Sandy Hook was the thing that nobody really wanted to talk about.
[02:57:36.665 --> 02:57:49.491]  Every time we brought the question, somebody was like, well, I don't know too much about that shooting, I don't know too much about that shooting, but I'll tell you about Virginia Tech, I'll tell you about the Aurora shooting, and I was like, why doesn't anybody want to talk about Sandy Hook when it's the new thing that's pushing the new agenda out there?
[02:57:50.091 --> 02:58:02.322]  Well, I mean, most of those people, because I've been to literally, let's not exaggerate, 20 of the 10 bureaucrat marches, and I mean, it's all either kind of mental patients they bring along, or it's government workers, or it's actual globalist agents.
[02:58:02.822 --> 02:58:17.635]  Oh yeah, and I think the reason they didn't want to talk about Sandy Hook when they were pushing their registration agenda, I mean, this is a guy who, regardless if you believe the official story, the official story says that the guy purchased, excuse me, stole the firearm from his mother.
[02:58:18.075 --> 02:58:19.075]  And they don't want to talk about that.
[02:58:19.115 --> 02:58:22.857]  Can you say, well, if you get stricter background checks, how's it going to stop a guy from stealing a gun?
[02:58:23.577 --> 02:58:24.857]  You know, they don't they don't want to bring that up.
[02:58:24.917 --> 02:58:25.818]  I think that's incredible.
[02:58:25.838 --> 02:58:28.539]  Info Wars Nightly News, seven o'clock central tonight.
[02:58:28.619 --> 02:58:29.239]  I'm hosting it.
[02:58:29.259 --> 02:58:32.100]  These guys will be in there with more news and commentary.
[02:58:32.120 --> 02:58:37.301]  But we're going to go to overdrive and I promise I'm going to shut up and go to Mark and Sean and Paul and Ron and a few others.
[02:58:37.362 --> 02:58:39.062]  Ron in New York, the retired cop.
[02:58:39.522 --> 02:58:40.162]  I need to call him.
[02:58:40.202 --> 02:58:41.263]  He's got some good intel for me.
[02:58:41.283 --> 02:58:42.323]  I got his number in my cell phone.
[02:58:42.643 --> 02:58:43.324]  I haven't called him yet.
[02:58:43.344 --> 02:58:43.964]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:43.984 --> 02:58:44.424]  Stay with us.
[02:58:46.533 --> 02:58:48.095]  Thank you for listening to GCN Live.

[02:58:55.751 --> 02:58:57.673]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:58:57.693 --> 02:58:59.635]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:58:59.875 --> 02:59:05.380]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:59:05.581 --> 02:59:09.364]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:59:09.644 --> 02:59:13.408]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:59:13.568 --> 02:59:14.769]  The fact is, you are.
[02:59:14.970 --> 02:59:15.730]  We all are.
[02:59:15.971 --> 02:59:18.313]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[03:00:15.442 --> 03:00:16.262]  You want answers?
[03:00:17.043 --> 03:00:17.943]  Well, so does he.

[03:00:22.765 --> 03:00:26.847]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:34.719 --> 03:00:36.320]  We're doing a couple of segments in overdrive here.
[03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:37.301]  Some stations carry it.
[03:00:37.481 --> 03:00:38.541]  For years, I did a fourth hour.
[03:00:38.561 --> 03:00:39.462]  I went back to three hours.
[03:00:40.162 --> 03:00:41.203]  I'm talking to the nightly news.
[03:00:42.083 --> 03:00:43.024]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[03:00:43.064 --> 03:00:45.105]  Sha'Carri Jackson's in here with us, along with David Knight.
[03:00:45.665 --> 03:00:51.369]  And in the next segment, let's talk about one of our new reporters in the report that's coming out tonight.
[03:00:51.409 --> 03:00:54.530]  This is pretty hilarious, but also pretty scary, pretty bombshell.
[03:00:55.191 --> 03:00:57.092]  Let's go to Mark in Pennsylvania.
[03:00:57.112 --> 03:00:57.792]  You're on the air.
[03:00:58.133 --> 03:00:58.513]  Go ahead.
[03:00:59.966 --> 03:01:02.206]  Guys, guys, get your pen and paper, pen and paper.
[03:01:02.246 --> 03:01:06.747]  I'm calling you from Philadelphia, but I'm originally from Missouri, Southern Missouri, Springfield to be precise.
[03:01:07.327 --> 03:01:10.028]  There's something happening in Missouri right now.
[03:01:11.208 --> 03:01:14.528]  A couple of guys put together a Second Amendment Preservation Act.
[03:01:14.588 --> 03:01:17.009]  It's House Bill 436, Senate Bill 325.
[03:01:18.969 --> 03:01:24.510]  And the Tenth Amendment Center is calling it some of the most powerful legislation to come from any state in a long time.
[03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:28.871]  Concerning the Second Amendment, but also related to the Tenth Amendment, and here's why.
[03:01:29.776 --> 03:01:40.322]  Effectively, if you read the detail of the bills, it effectively nullifies the Firearms Control Acts of 1968 and 1934.
[03:01:40.642 --> 03:01:54.990]  I've been trying to get the word out to as many people as, primarily, Missourians, to let them know to call their representatives, call their state senators, and hammer this down because this could be breakthrough legislation, not only for Missouri, but for the rest of the states to follow suit.
[03:01:56.775 --> 03:01:57.596]  Sounds good to me.
[03:01:57.676 --> 03:02:06.762]  I mean, look, I called it the Second American Revolution six months ago, and I said it'd be a state's rights movement not to destroy the republic, but to recapture the republic and then re-upload it.
[03:02:07.203 --> 03:02:11.366]  It's like we gotta kick the virus out and then re-upload the software.
[03:02:12.003 --> 03:02:12.443]  Exactly.
[03:02:12.483 --> 03:02:13.543]  It's what we were just talking about before.
[03:02:13.583 --> 03:02:23.146]  We've got to get behind constitutional sheriffs, and we've got to get behind state legislators who are going to stand for the Constitution, and more importantly, are going to stand for our individual rights, which transcend even the Constitution.
[03:02:23.166 --> 03:02:29.208]  The Constitution recognizes... It only points out, like the Ninth Amendment says, hey, all rights not listed here doesn't mean they don't exist.
[03:02:30.028 --> 03:02:31.209]  I mean, it's... Yeah, that's the thing.
[03:02:31.249 --> 03:02:35.070]  They want to make your rights a privilege, as David keeps alluding to.
[03:02:36.090 --> 03:02:36.650]  Absolutely.
[03:02:36.670 --> 03:02:37.711]  Man, that's a great point.
[03:02:39.451 --> 03:02:39.851]  Caller.
[03:02:40.792 --> 03:02:41.753]  A great point, Mark.
[03:02:41.833 --> 03:02:44.916]  I hope that you'll... And don't just count on us to know about something.
[03:02:45.216 --> 03:02:46.397]  Shoot a YouTube video.
[03:02:47.538 --> 03:02:49.119]  It's like the Veritas Project guy said.
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:51.281]  Very successful targeting the globalists.
[03:02:51.822 --> 03:02:54.724]  And he said, look, we need other people to do this.
[03:02:54.824 --> 03:02:55.865]  This is what's going to beat them.
[03:02:56.225 --> 03:02:56.426]  Right.
[03:02:57.145 --> 03:02:59.366]  We need to just, Obama's like, swarm them!
[03:02:59.586 --> 03:03:01.047]  I need you to help me get the guns!
[03:03:01.067 --> 03:03:02.667]  That's because they don't have the people.
[03:03:03.228 --> 03:03:11.591]  I mean, literally, Obama supporters on average, and again, I'm not a Republican, Republicans act like they're constitutional and have a lot of better ideas, but they're sold out and controlled.
[03:03:11.851 --> 03:03:15.212]  With the Democrats, I mean, you've got to be really dumb to want to be a communist.
[03:03:15.793 --> 03:03:21.815]  I mean, you've got to be really dumb to, and I think these clips get thrown away after you use them, like that state rep.
[03:03:22.095 --> 03:03:23.656]  I mean, these people are really dumb.
[03:03:25.426 --> 03:03:27.327]  What do you do when idiots are running things?
[03:03:27.788 --> 03:03:35.833]  Well half, well not all, but a good portion of his supporters aren't even real because we've shown those those reports about how the Twitter followers and all this other stuff is cooked up.
[03:03:36.153 --> 03:03:37.494]  70 plus percent of Obamas are fake.
[03:03:37.854 --> 03:03:43.878]  Yeah, so I mean they're not all there, but they get people like these mom groups every now and then to go out there and do a little dirty work for him.
[03:03:44.138 --> 03:03:44.919]  Well we'll check those out.
[03:03:44.939 --> 03:03:47.821]  That's Missouri and it's House Bill 436 and Senate Bill 235.
[03:03:48.481 --> 03:03:49.261]  Absolutely, Mark.
[03:03:49.301 --> 03:03:49.722]  Anything else?
[03:03:51.035 --> 03:03:54.376]  Well, also, a friend of mine put together a website.
[03:03:54.596 --> 03:03:55.956]  It's 1776trumps1984.com.
[03:03:56.116 --> 03:03:58.116]  You can find out more information.
[03:03:58.176 --> 03:03:59.897]  People can go there and download the flyer.
[03:03:59.917 --> 03:04:01.177]  They can pass them out.
[03:04:01.277 --> 03:04:02.117]  It's a pretty neat flyer.
[03:04:02.137 --> 03:04:03.877]  It's got a colonial guy with an AK-47.
[03:04:03.917 --> 03:04:06.438]  I wonder where you thought of that.
[03:04:06.698 --> 03:04:06.978]  1776trumps1984.
[03:04:07.098 --> 03:04:07.698]  I love it.
[03:04:09.238 --> 03:04:13.839]  We ought to come up with a weird card deck that has stuff like that on it.
[03:04:14.099 --> 03:04:17.020]  Not just, here's the bad New World Order guy, but funny stuff.
[03:04:18.905 --> 03:04:20.066]  Alright brother, good to hear from you.
[03:04:20.086 --> 03:04:21.127]  I'm going to check that side out.
[03:04:21.847 --> 03:04:31.174]  And again, please, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to break, come back and do another segment with your calls for Sean and Ron and Paul and Alex and everybody with our guest host here.
[03:04:31.455 --> 03:04:33.376]  It's fun having you guys ride shotgun with me.
[03:04:34.016 --> 03:04:35.398]  Yeah, it's an interesting day.
[03:04:37.139 --> 03:04:38.320]  A day long remembered.
[03:04:38.940 --> 03:04:40.702]  We've seen the end of Kenobi.
[03:04:41.162 --> 03:04:44.044]  We'll soon see the end of the Rebellion.
[03:04:44.124 --> 03:04:45.645]  Alright, I'm gonna stop it.
[03:04:45.665 --> 03:04:47.567]  I get a little dingy, Jakari.
[03:04:47.587 --> 03:04:47.827]  I know.
[03:04:47.847 --> 03:04:51.069]  Can you imagine someday, Jakari, not even knowing you're on the air, not even caring?
[03:04:53.191 --> 03:04:55.793]  I could see that day coming, yeah.
[03:04:55.813 --> 03:04:57.074]  I hear the train a-comin'.
[03:04:57.554 --> 03:04:59.195]  It's rollin' round the bend.
[03:04:59.215 --> 03:05:03.298]  And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
[03:05:03.578 --> 03:05:05.140]  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison.
[03:05:06.246 --> 03:05:07.387]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:07.647 --> 03:05:18.095]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:18.296 --> 03:05:22.399]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:22.759 --> 03:05:25.181]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:25.502 --> 03:05:36.372]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:36.793 --> 03:05:39.936]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:40.256 --> 03:05:45.961]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:46.402 --> 03:05:55.910]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:56.290 --> 03:05:57.471]  The war is here.
[03:05:57.812 --> 03:05:59.213]  It's an info war.
[03:05:59.693 --> 03:06:02.396]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:06.099 --> 03:06:07.741]  Chicago is a virtual battlefield.
[03:06:07.881 --> 03:06:12.004]  More than 500 shooting deaths in 2012 have made Chicago the murder capital of America.
[03:06:12.124 --> 03:06:13.605]  Proof that gun control doesn't work.
[03:06:13.665 --> 03:06:16.768]  Disarming law-abiding citizens ensures that only criminals have guns.
[03:06:16.968 --> 03:06:20.071]  And Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Machine want to keep it that way.
[03:06:20.231 --> 03:06:22.913]  If we can't stop them in Chicago, we may lose the whole battle.
[03:06:22.993 --> 03:06:23.594]  But there's hope.
[03:06:23.794 --> 03:06:26.596]  On April 9th, we have a chance to send billionaire Mike Bloomberg
[03:06:26.796 --> 03:06:35.642]  Rami Manuel and his Chicago machine a crystal clear message that we have a natural right to defend ourselves our homes and our families and that they need to keep their hands off our guns.
[03:06:35.862 --> 03:06:42.487]  Illinois Republican Paul McKinley is sending that message in a bitterly false special election to replace disgraced ex-rep Jesse Jackson Jr.
[03:06:42.927 --> 03:06:47.790]  Every vote, every voice in support of Paul McKinley is a stand against the gun-grabbing Chicago machine.
[03:06:47.950 --> 03:06:49.751]  Will you stand up and defend your gun rights?
[03:06:49.891 --> 03:06:50.091]  Call 800-979-1555.
[03:06:50.111 --> 03:06:50.171]  800-979-1555.
[03:06:50.191 --> 03:06:50.371]  That's 800-979-1555.
[03:06:50.391 --> 03:06:50.431]  800-979-1555.
[03:07:07.699 --> 03:07:09.380]  Are you still a traditional smoker?
[03:07:09.781 --> 03:07:14.484]  Now experience a new lifestyle and try vaping with e-cigarettes by Lecig.
[03:07:14.904 --> 03:07:18.567]  Imagine no ashes, stains, nasty smell, or coughing and hacking.
[03:07:18.767 --> 03:07:29.515]  With Lecig e-cigarettes revolutionary microelectronic technology, rechargeable battery, and unique replaceable cartridge, you'll get all the benefits and satisfaction of smoking without the hazards.
[03:07:29.675 --> 03:07:34.178]  Choose your taste from a wide variety of our new American-made Vapriate e-liquids at
[03:07:34.278 --> 03:07:34.658]  Call 870-518-4307.
[03:07:57.230 --> 03:07:58.011]  Big Brother.
[03:08:12.057 --> 03:08:13.098]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:13.838 --> 03:08:14.958]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:15.599 --> 03:08:16.399]  You want answers?
[03:08:17.179 --> 03:08:18.040]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:18.740 --> 03:08:22.362]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:22.922 --> 03:08:26.964]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:31.846 --> 03:08:33.087]  This is CNN.
[03:08:33.107 --> 03:08:38.411]  Closed caption provided by Belliclint, the heart of closed caption communication.
[03:08:38.911 --> 03:08:41.673]  You guys were saying, can you really do it, Darth Vader?
[03:08:42.013 --> 03:08:42.794]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[03:08:42.814 --> 03:08:43.735]  I can probably really do it.
[03:08:45.516 --> 03:08:47.337]  Don't act so surprised, your highness.
[03:08:47.377 --> 03:08:49.599]  You weren't on the mercy mission this time.
[03:08:50.079 --> 03:08:52.301]  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship.
[03:08:52.661 --> 03:08:55.203]  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
[03:08:56.144 --> 03:08:57.184]  This is a diplomatic ship.
[03:08:57.464 --> 03:08:59.766]  You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.
[03:09:00.046 --> 03:09:00.647]  Take her away.
[03:09:01.826 --> 03:09:02.907]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:09:03.247 --> 03:09:05.729]  Anyway, I'm just having fun.
[03:09:05.889 --> 03:09:09.672]  Why not have some fun while these gun-grabbing bastards are running all over us?
[03:09:10.332 --> 03:09:11.093]  Lying to us.
[03:09:11.113 --> 03:09:12.494]  You know what makes me the maddest?
[03:09:12.514 --> 03:09:15.956]  If they said, we are here to enslave you, lay down your arms, and we'll kill you.
[03:09:17.137 --> 03:09:18.438]  Then we'd organize and defeat them.
[03:09:18.458 --> 03:09:22.961]  Instead of saying, we want to be your friend, no one wants to take your guns, we'll kill you little bastards as soon as we can.
[03:09:23.202 --> 03:09:24.683]  Oh, hi, we're your friends.
[03:09:24.703 --> 03:09:27.205]  I mean, I'm like, I'm sick of these people.
[03:09:27.485 --> 03:09:28.505]  Yeah, I think we all are.
[03:09:30.034 --> 03:09:31.236]  And that's what we saw at this rally.
[03:09:31.716 --> 03:09:33.078]  That's what we saw everywhere at this rally.
[03:09:33.479 --> 03:09:34.480]  I don't want your guns, right?
[03:09:34.520 --> 03:09:36.423]  And then we had the one Martinez said he did.
[03:09:37.144 --> 03:09:38.005]  And then everybody's cheering.
[03:09:38.025 --> 03:09:39.808]  It's like, yeah, if we can get the guns, we'll take them.
[03:09:39.848 --> 03:09:40.789]  Yeah, we'll take them.
[03:09:41.991 --> 03:09:42.632]  Yeah.
[03:09:42.672 --> 03:09:44.795]  They want to live like Chicago or New York.
[03:09:45.656 --> 03:09:46.357]  They love it.
[03:09:46.797 --> 03:09:46.978]  Yeah.
[03:09:47.745 --> 03:09:47.905]  Yeah.
[03:09:48.005 --> 03:09:53.509]  But let's understand that they're talking about taking due process from people right now with these registration bills.
[03:09:53.569 --> 03:09:57.912]  They're going to take that due process and, you know, quote-unquote felons, okay?
[03:09:58.072 --> 03:09:59.293]  People who let go of balloons.
[03:09:59.313 --> 03:10:01.875]  It's like, oh, it's just felons and, by the way, get rid of the process.
[03:10:02.295 --> 03:10:06.478]  Or even people who are alleged to be felons, like Antonio... Beeler.
[03:10:06.498 --> 03:10:06.778]  Beeler.
[03:10:06.938 --> 03:10:07.279]  Yeah.
[03:10:07.619 --> 03:10:09.260]  Sorry, I keep losing his last name there.
[03:10:09.420 --> 03:10:13.622]  No, no, he said everybody always makes fun of him and goes, Bueller, Bueller, from the Ferris Bueller.
[03:10:14.123 --> 03:10:16.184]  I mean, that's what it looks like if you look at the guy's name.
[03:10:16.384 --> 03:10:20.646]  I know, everybody I know says you pronounce it Bueller, but he goes, no, it's Beeler.
[03:10:21.507 --> 03:10:22.788]  So it's like potato patata.
[03:10:23.068 --> 03:10:23.788]  Right.
[03:10:23.828 --> 03:10:27.010]  It's like Brett Farb is really Faberge or something.
[03:10:27.452 --> 03:10:30.134]  Well, not that fancy, but you're on the right track.
[03:10:30.294 --> 03:10:31.716]  But Antonio Bieler didn't cave.
[03:10:32.036 --> 03:10:34.298]  And he started an organization here in Austin, too.
[03:10:34.398 --> 03:10:36.480]  So, I mean, that... No, he's taking action.
[03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:37.821]  I admire what he's doing.
[03:10:37.881 --> 03:10:39.062]  I was being sarcastic with him.
[03:10:39.102 --> 03:10:40.483]  I think he almost thought I was being serious.
[03:10:40.623 --> 03:10:41.104]  Yeah, no.
[03:10:41.324 --> 03:10:42.365]  I was there teasing him.
[03:10:42.965 --> 03:10:49.272]  We need to realize that the guy that was the antagonist in this story, where he was unjustly persecuted, was our own Art Acevedo.
[03:10:49.612 --> 03:10:51.514]  The guy who said, don't worry, you've got nothing to fear.
[03:10:51.674 --> 03:10:53.616]  That's why the feds like him.
[03:10:53.636 --> 03:10:54.998]  They're like, wow, look at this guy.
[03:10:55.538 --> 03:10:58.862]  He's like, never mind this knife, I'm sliding into your freedom.
[03:11:00.303 --> 03:11:01.244]  See, it's air-conditioned.
[03:11:01.264 --> 03:11:02.185]  It's Cold Blade, isn't it?
[03:11:03.186 --> 03:11:05.949]  And your body's going to be cold here politically real quick.
[03:11:07.398 --> 03:11:10.459]  Let me just draw this razor across your neck, America.
[03:11:10.879 --> 03:11:11.459]  I'm nice.
[03:11:11.539 --> 03:11:12.639]  I don't want it to be Cuba.
[03:11:12.959 --> 03:11:15.639]  I want it to be a new authoritarian state I run.
[03:11:16.240 --> 03:11:17.100]  That's Arte Saavedra.
[03:11:18.080 --> 03:11:22.301]  Meanwhile, we've got families that have to escape to Cuba now, in today's America, right?
[03:11:22.321 --> 03:11:25.701]  Because Cuba doesn't like to CPS your kids unless you've really abused them.
[03:11:25.721 --> 03:11:26.061]  That's right.
[03:11:26.701 --> 03:11:27.982]  It's like we've outstretched them.
[03:11:28.022 --> 03:11:28.882]  Okay, let's go to calls here.
[03:11:30.262 --> 03:11:33.623]  Let's talk to Sean in Canada, then Ron in New York, while I'm gibbering.
[03:11:33.643 --> 03:11:34.883]  Go ahead, and Paul and others.
[03:11:35.003 --> 03:11:35.863]  Go ahead, Sean.
[03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:37.450]  How are you doing, Alex?
[03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:38.210]  Great to talk to you.
[03:11:38.230 --> 03:11:47.752]  I'm a longtime listener, a recent Prison Planet Thought TV member, a political science graduate, and thanks to your graduate with a stellar average, you really invigorated my interest.
[03:11:47.812 --> 03:11:48.372]  Impressive.
[03:11:48.653 --> 03:11:49.653]  Most impressive.
[03:11:50.513 --> 03:11:51.473]  Well, God bless you, man.
[03:11:51.493 --> 03:11:57.414]  Before you, I thought history had been written, and like so many people, I thought we were at the end of history in a way.
[03:11:57.434 --> 03:12:02.115]  There was nothing new to discover, there were no secrets, and everything was hunky-dory.
[03:12:02.395 --> 03:12:03.816]  You've opened my eyes to a whole new world.
[03:12:05.896 --> 03:12:06.877]  That's what I love to hear.
[03:12:07.457 --> 03:12:08.657]  I don't wake people up.
[03:12:08.697 --> 03:12:09.758]  We're the opposite of a cult.
[03:12:10.658 --> 03:12:12.439]  Cults tell you this is how it is.
[03:12:12.479 --> 03:12:13.219]  You must only believe this.
[03:12:13.259 --> 03:12:14.280]  We say open your eyes.
[03:12:14.780 --> 03:12:15.400]  Look at this.
[03:12:15.520 --> 03:12:17.541]  And that's what will defeat the globalists.
[03:12:17.701 --> 03:12:19.062]  Because the New World Order is a cult.
[03:12:19.262 --> 03:12:21.403]  You've got to buy into their delusional lies.
[03:12:22.703 --> 03:12:23.143]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:12:23.163 --> 03:12:24.324]  What was your comment today?
[03:12:26.857 --> 03:12:28.318]  Dispense with the pleasantries.
[03:12:28.899 --> 03:12:30.020]  Oh yes, excuse me, sorry.
[03:12:30.340 --> 03:12:35.004]  So yeah, so I live in Canada, and it's just, you know, I'm a huge constitutionalist.
[03:12:35.024 --> 03:12:36.805]  I mean, like I said, I got my degree in polysci.
[03:12:36.825 --> 03:12:37.586]  I lived in New York City.
[03:12:37.626 --> 03:12:38.987]  I have family in America.
[03:12:39.548 --> 03:12:40.408]  I love the U.S.
[03:12:40.428 --> 03:12:41.229]  Constitution Bill of Rights.
[03:12:41.249 --> 03:12:44.052]  I think it's the greatest document that the world has ever seen written by men.
[03:12:44.652 --> 03:12:47.174]  And yeah, I try to reach out to everybody.
[03:12:47.194 --> 03:12:51.558]  I tell all my friends, I talk to my friends, and everybody is just so close-minded, trusting, and naive.
[03:12:52.533 --> 03:12:55.937]  And they just, they cannot wrap their heads around the fact that they don't know.
[03:12:55.957 --> 03:12:59.240]  Well remember, zombies have never, these are people brought up to television.
[03:12:59.541 --> 03:13:02.364]  They just kind of are in a daze, literal brainwaves now.
[03:13:02.684 --> 03:13:04.886]  And so, they're tuned in to suspend disbelief.
[03:13:05.487 --> 03:13:08.530]  So it's like, it's like the light, they're like, uh, scary.
[03:13:09.010 --> 03:13:09.991]  They think of it as work.
[03:13:10.652 --> 03:13:13.516]  They haven't taken it personal yet that they're being enslaved.
[03:13:14.176 --> 03:13:14.877]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:13:14.917 --> 03:13:18.322]  It's always a minority that doesn't want to be enslaved and that stands up.
[03:13:18.402 --> 03:13:19.243]  So don't feel bad.
[03:13:19.263 --> 03:13:22.247]  Because some areas you run into, the majority's awake.
[03:13:22.607 --> 03:13:25.210]  And then you run into another area, believe me, you're not a public figure.
[03:13:26.091 --> 03:13:30.777]  If you were Alex Jones, and it's not bragging, hey I'm a big shot, everywhere I go, people come up.
[03:13:30.797 --> 03:13:31.357]  I mean, you've seen it.
[03:13:31.798 --> 03:13:38.225]  I mean, now to the point of like, I can't even go on the hike and bike trail, like, I can't go to Barton Springs, I can't go to Mexico, people come up to me.
[03:13:38.565 --> 03:13:40.407]  And believe me, folks, they're out there.
[03:13:40.588 --> 03:13:46.474]  That's why you should wear an Infowars.com t-shirt, because then you'll meet like-minded people, plus it funds the operation.
[03:13:46.494 --> 03:13:46.995]  Go ahead, gentlemen.
[03:13:47.657 --> 03:13:53.779]  Well, one of the things is, when you look at these articles from CNN and other places, they don't usually have a reference to the other documents.
[03:13:53.859 --> 03:14:01.721]  When you look at an InfoWars article and we talk about something like ammunition purchases, we're going back and we're linking directly to those purchases so you can see it for yourself.
[03:14:02.381 --> 03:14:06.782]  You know, you can Google it, you don't even, you know, we've got the links there so people can see the documents and they still deny them.
[03:14:06.862 --> 03:14:13.624]  Every year in August they have articles in every local paper, I read them this year, or now I guess last year, saying, it's the law.
[03:14:13.964 --> 03:14:17.065]  You must take the vaccines and there's no side effects.
[03:14:18.189 --> 03:14:31.046]  No, no links, obviously it's a newspaper, no bibliograph, according to such and such, you go online, the same thing on the newspaper, you go to our article, hundreds of university links, how it's going to kill you, the copy of the insert.
[03:14:31.226 --> 03:14:31.486]  Right.
[03:14:33.115 --> 03:14:35.036]  I don't know, they just like to say stuff about it.
[03:14:35.056 --> 03:14:38.178]  It's like, I believe it was a couple weeks ago, somebody wrote a hit piece on you.
[03:14:38.499 --> 03:14:42.681]  They said, Alex Jones has reported that TSA hires defrocked priests.
[03:14:43.382 --> 03:14:47.204]  And like, we have the articles on Infowars right now, but they didn't link to that.
[03:14:47.224 --> 03:14:49.606]  They just, they say, they claim that you made it.
[03:14:50.006 --> 03:14:51.727]  You made that statement, but did not link to it.
[03:14:52.048 --> 03:14:53.048]  And that's the kind of things that they do.
[03:14:53.068 --> 03:14:59.473]  Well, even patriot groups 10 years later go, Jones claims he has footage of FEMA teaching the Founding Fathers are bad.
[03:14:59.813 --> 03:15:02.975]  I have where it was, Kansas City, the video, and the manual.
[03:15:02.995 --> 03:15:03.155]  Right.
[03:15:03.375 --> 03:15:03.515]  Yeah.
[03:15:25.410 --> 03:15:35.841]  I just wanted to say that every single legislator involved in voting for these bills and whatnot and trying to institute gun control is literally committing treason.
[03:15:35.861 --> 03:15:39.646]  I was reading an essay by a constitutional lawyer that I got off Oath Keepers.
[03:15:39.746 --> 03:15:40.647]  I've joined them as well.
[03:15:41.363 --> 03:15:42.543]  No, no, I mean it is treason.
[03:15:42.623 --> 03:15:43.423]  It is sedition.
[03:15:43.464 --> 03:15:49.985]  I don't get up here... Look, it's criminal to knowingly get up there and lie and try to register guns with a plan to confiscate them.
[03:15:50.085 --> 03:15:53.566]  It is organized government fraud that has a name, tyranny.
[03:15:53.806 --> 03:15:54.486]  Thanks for the call.
[03:15:54.586 --> 03:15:57.447]  Ron in New York, then Paul in New Jersey.
[03:15:58.367 --> 03:15:59.987]  Ron, you're on the air, sir.
[03:16:00.307 --> 03:16:02.308]  Is this the retired cop that gives me so much good info?
[03:16:02.995 --> 03:16:03.475]  Yes it is.
[03:16:03.495 --> 03:16:05.637]  And by the way, I'm going to try to call you today.
[03:16:05.657 --> 03:16:08.000]  I know I got your number and you've got some inside intel.
[03:16:08.020 --> 03:16:09.561]  I've been meaning to call you, I've just run out of time.
[03:16:10.021 --> 03:16:12.604]  What's your point on the orgy of evil you've been seeing?
[03:16:13.404 --> 03:16:17.388]  Well, here, case in point, in the state of New York, the other big shoe is dropped.
[03:16:17.948 --> 03:16:28.058]  We've now had the first case in the state of New York where the state police have ordered the seizure of somebody's firearms, who's a pistol permit holder, because he has some months past.
[03:16:28.718 --> 03:16:29.278]  No, no, no.
[03:16:29.458 --> 03:16:39.502]  They push it on you like drug dealers in a schoolyard, and now they're announcing, that's our article you're talking about that's on Drudge, that they're coming for our guns.
[03:16:39.522 --> 03:16:40.823]  Thank God I've never been on anything.
[03:16:49.790 --> 03:16:54.052]  I mean, I had a surgery and didn't want to take the opiate pills because they made me sick.
[03:16:54.873 --> 03:16:56.934]  You ain't got nothing on me, dirtbag government!
[03:16:56.954 --> 03:16:57.474]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:16:58.175 --> 03:16:58.675]  Go ahead, Ron.
[03:16:59.055 --> 03:17:01.697]  It's something they had absolutely no legal right to do.
[03:17:01.757 --> 03:17:14.664]  This is the suspicion that the police cross-referenced a list of pistol permit holders with what we have in New York State, and you'll soon have in the nation with Obamacare, a medical prescription database.
[03:17:14.704 --> 03:17:17.126]  No, no, that's in there, and it was for the gun confiscation.
[03:17:17.146 --> 03:17:19.307]  They're going to declare us all mentally defective.
[03:17:20.470 --> 03:17:25.692]  And what Ron just described is exactly what Acevedo wants to do here in Austin, in Texas.
[03:17:27.573 --> 03:17:30.333]  But oh, we're supposed to like it and we're conspiracy theorists.
[03:17:30.874 --> 03:17:37.356]  Even though the mayor pro tem is up there saying, we'll get your guns, I'll get you registered and your little dog too.
[03:17:37.930 --> 03:17:38.351]  Pretty much.
[03:17:38.371 --> 03:17:50.946]  I just got an email the other day from a guy, I can't remember where he was, but he said he called his mom talking about he was mildly depressed because he lost his job and then the SWAT team showed up at his house demanding that he come outside and turn in his firearm.
[03:17:50.966 --> 03:17:53.550]  This happened to G. Gordon Liddy's producer like 15 years ago.
[03:17:55.939 --> 03:18:00.082]  She like answered a survey or something that had her address on it and got put in for like a month.
[03:18:00.142 --> 03:18:04.146]  You know, gorgeous model, producer, you know, famous.
[03:18:05.066 --> 03:18:07.488]  And just, you know, they wrecked her life.
[03:18:07.528 --> 03:18:08.749]  This is the secret police.
[03:18:08.789 --> 03:18:12.272]  This is an industry that wants, they're not just going to CPS little kids.
[03:18:12.673 --> 03:18:13.934]  They're going to CPS adults.
[03:18:14.952 --> 03:18:15.532]  Exactly, yeah.
[03:18:15.692 --> 03:18:16.533]  Well, that's their cult.
[03:18:16.873 --> 03:18:22.655]  They had a Democratic Party operative in psychology today write a big cover story about how I'm insane.
[03:18:23.195 --> 03:18:25.356]  Yeah, insanely free, insanely alive.
[03:18:25.696 --> 03:18:27.357]  You're insanely politically dead.
[03:18:27.377 --> 03:18:29.518]  You're a pathetic creature.
[03:18:30.378 --> 03:18:31.739]  And he says I'm mentally ill.
[03:18:32.099 --> 03:18:50.453]  Well, that was always the tactic of Stalin and other dictators, to say that people were insane, and to commit them without any due process, because people will stand for a lesser due process if you accuse somebody of being insane, or you say that they're on a dangerous drug, and yet we want to put the people who are prescribing these dangerous drugs in charge of determining who is sane.
[03:18:50.974 --> 03:18:53.476]  Well, there is a cult of white robes.
[03:18:54.764 --> 03:19:00.886]  You know, the court, in your pleadings, you worship to it, you pray, for the folks that don't know, you pray in the pleading.
[03:19:01.066 --> 03:19:02.547]  You start praying in pleadings, you start winning.
[03:19:03.207 --> 03:19:06.508]  All these modern lawyers don't know it's about worshiping the court.
[03:19:07.149 --> 03:19:10.170]  It's a Roman court, basically, is what they've superimposed over our common law.
[03:19:10.530 --> 03:19:13.411]  So you worship the judge, you pray to the judge, you pray to the court.
[03:19:13.991 --> 03:19:16.093]  You can even throw some more stuff in there and they'll really get excited.
[03:19:16.113 --> 03:19:18.636]  It's like ancient commands.
[03:19:18.977 --> 03:19:23.982]  But the whole point is, I don't know why I even went off into that whole story, is that now it's not even going to be courts.
[03:19:24.002 --> 03:19:24.883]  They're just going to take your guns.
[03:19:25.304 --> 03:19:25.444]  Yeah.
[03:19:25.464 --> 03:19:26.265]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:19:26.285 --> 03:19:26.825]  That's what they want.
[03:19:27.005 --> 03:19:28.107]  Ron, anything else you want to add?
[03:19:28.789 --> 03:19:31.512]  Yes, there's quite a bit else I'd like to add.
[03:19:31.832 --> 03:19:33.874]  There was, now with the U.N.
[03:19:33.974 --> 03:19:36.717]  Arms Treaty, okay... We're going to skip this break, go ahead.
[03:19:36.757 --> 03:19:38.419]  We're going to skip this break, go ahead.
[03:19:38.659 --> 03:19:46.287]  It's immaterial whether or not they ratify that treaty because of domestic laws that are presently being discussed in Congress.
[03:19:49.729 --> 03:19:52.470]  No, that's why they're trying to get it through, but I've read the treaty.
[03:19:52.851 --> 03:19:54.972]  It points to the directives in other agreements.
[03:19:55.332 --> 03:19:58.854]  We've done countless reports on this that says the state can have government.
[03:19:59.895 --> 03:20:01.876]  The state can have guns, not the people.
[03:20:02.316 --> 03:20:06.959]  So it says we don't interfere with state rights to guns, but state is defined as the United States.
[03:20:07.776 --> 03:20:11.499]  Go ahead, David, you want to say something?
[03:20:11.720 --> 03:20:19.567]  The fact is, gentlemen, that whether they ratify that treaty or not, if this legislation that's being proposed and supposedly going to be voted on in the U.S.
[03:20:19.587 --> 03:20:22.349]  Senate tomorrow passes, they get what they want.
[03:20:22.489 --> 03:20:24.151]  It's all the same thing in the end.
[03:20:24.631 --> 03:20:25.732]  And they know what they're doing.
[03:20:25.792 --> 03:20:46.574]  Now, another thing, too, that I've just about had it with, and I think it's time that we be brave enough to step up as men and say this, we are an insensitive beast, but I believe five months of mindless emotionalism thrown at me, constantly showing the families or so forth of Newtown is a bit enough.
[03:20:47.174 --> 03:20:51.016]  This is a social policy issue that should be thought through intelligently.
[03:20:51.116 --> 03:20:53.117]  Well, they're waving the bloody shirt.
[03:20:53.137 --> 03:20:54.238]  I appreciate your call, Ron.
[03:20:54.538 --> 03:20:58.340]  They're obviously 100% shamelessly doing this.
[03:20:58.380 --> 03:21:01.562]  I mean, it's about making us the bad guys.
[03:21:02.122 --> 03:21:04.043]  Hitler demonized groups before he went after him.
[03:21:04.544 --> 03:21:05.704]  Every authoritarian does this.
[03:21:05.764 --> 03:21:06.825]  We're being demonized.
[03:21:07.205 --> 03:21:15.913]  Yeah, I mean, that's the, you know, that's the most ammunition they have, is to just wave these kids, to bring the kids on stage and, hey kids, what do you think about gun laws?
[03:21:16.013 --> 03:21:22.038]  I would really like Obama to ask, hey kids, what do you think about these drones killing other kids in other parts of the world?
[03:21:22.518 --> 03:21:24.040]  I really wish he'd ask those kids that.
[03:21:24.280 --> 03:21:27.603]  Well, what Ron was saying about the UN Arms Trade Treaty is exactly right.
[03:21:28.223 --> 03:21:31.084]  I think that this has been the target all along, is registration.
[03:21:32.205 --> 03:21:36.087]  They talked about confiscation, and Feinstein is a master of misdirection.
[03:21:36.107 --> 03:21:37.508]  You know, she did that with the NDAA.
[03:21:37.588 --> 03:21:48.493]  She told people that she came up with a Feinstein-Lee amendment that said we're going to take out the bad sections of the NDAA that violate civil liberties and deny due process and turn this into a military court instead of a civilian court.
[03:21:48.873 --> 03:21:50.474]  And then they just removed it, arbitrarily.
[03:21:50.794 --> 03:21:56.257]  You know, McCain... Or then they come back and go, this is the new NDAA, we're going to restrict it, and then it gets rid of posse comitatus.
[03:21:56.437 --> 03:21:56.837]  Right.
[03:21:56.898 --> 03:21:58.359]  So she's been involved in this kind of misdirection.
[03:21:58.399 --> 03:21:59.340]  Let me treat that bullet wound.
[03:21:59.380 --> 03:22:00.461]  Boom, boom, boom.
[03:22:01.182 --> 03:22:02.904]  She's been involved in this kind of misdirection before.
[03:22:03.004 --> 03:22:04.646]  And this is about registration.
[03:22:04.706 --> 03:22:08.670]  This arms trade treaty focuses on the transfer of weapons across borders.
[03:22:09.070 --> 03:22:14.456]  And they said the only way that we can do that is if we identify and register guns and gun owners.
[03:22:14.476 --> 03:22:14.776]  That's right.
[03:22:14.816 --> 03:22:17.479]  The states have to agree to control the guns within their borders.
[03:22:17.639 --> 03:22:23.664]  So just like Agenda 21, the UN comes up and they have this other, uh, I can't remember right off the top of my head.
[03:22:23.704 --> 03:22:24.705]  Legal framework.
[03:22:24.765 --> 03:22:26.446]  Yeah, they create these legal frameworks.
[03:22:26.466 --> 03:22:26.686]  UNIDIR.
[03:22:26.966 --> 03:22:31.150]  Yeah, just like they do with Agenda 21, and then they have the individual countries enact this.
[03:22:31.430 --> 03:22:33.191]  So they're coming at it from both directions.
[03:22:33.211 --> 03:22:36.694]  They're coming at it with domestic legislation, and they're coming at it with the treaty.
[03:22:36.834 --> 03:22:39.717]  Because they're not going to take a chance that they're going to lose on this registration.
[03:22:39.777 --> 03:22:46.003]  And if we say that we won because we beat them back from confiscation and all we got was registration, that was what they were after all along.
[03:22:46.023 --> 03:22:46.444]  Absolutely.
[03:22:46.464 --> 03:22:47.825]  And again, it's too two-sided.
[03:22:47.845 --> 03:22:55.052]  They're not only trying to get us registered for confiscation, a bunch of states are already taking them, and home inspections and all this.
[03:22:55.473 --> 03:23:00.358]  Internationally, it's about not letting little countries get arms to protect themselves from the UN death force.
[03:23:01.158 --> 03:23:02.319]  And if folks don't know, the U.N.
[03:23:02.339 --> 03:23:05.822]  is the greatest mass murderer over time the world's ever seen.
[03:23:05.882 --> 03:23:08.544]  Mao has the highest number, then Stalin, and then Hitler.
[03:23:08.564 --> 03:23:10.706]  Well, I should go Stalin, Lenin, Hitler.
[03:23:11.106 --> 03:23:13.108]  But the U.N.
[03:23:13.208 --> 03:23:18.932]  continually just is murdering, slaughtering, raping, lining people up, shooting them.
[03:23:19.053 --> 03:23:20.974]  But Angelina Jolie says they love your kids.
[03:23:21.334 --> 03:23:22.395]  Let's go to a phone call.
[03:23:22.475 --> 03:23:23.956]  Paul in New Jersey.
[03:23:24.357 --> 03:23:25.357]  You're on the air, Paul.
[03:23:25.418 --> 03:23:25.738]  Welcome.
[03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:27.491]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[03:23:28.371 --> 03:23:30.013]  Yeah, well, you're talking about Fast and Furious.
[03:23:30.033 --> 03:23:36.017]  Well, that's the guns for the drug dealers, our drug dealers.
[03:23:36.598 --> 03:23:38.600]  They give them, that's their supply.
[03:23:38.620 --> 03:23:41.922]  They give them the guns and they shoot the people who are trying to stop them down there.
[03:23:42.222 --> 03:23:43.183]  That's when he shot the 200 Mexicans.
[03:23:44.604 --> 03:23:46.605]  And one of our INSA units.
[03:23:46.745 --> 03:23:48.925]  Sir, it's actually in the thousands.
[03:23:48.945 --> 03:23:50.525]  They can serve nearly 400.
[03:23:50.585 --> 03:23:54.186]  It's thousands and thousands of dead Mexicans with the Fast and Furious stuff.
[03:23:54.266 --> 03:23:54.926]  Hundreds here.
[03:23:55.246 --> 03:23:56.127]  At least three cops.
[03:23:56.187 --> 03:23:57.367]  Border Patrol and a cop.
[03:23:58.027 --> 03:23:59.267]  You're absolutely right.
[03:23:59.727 --> 03:24:00.127]  Imagine.
[03:24:00.368 --> 03:24:02.888]  It's not about Fast and Furious anymore and all those dead kids.
[03:24:03.248 --> 03:24:09.169]  It's about how we, Obama actually and Holder and the rest of them, shipped the guns down there to blame the Second Amendment.
[03:24:09.410 --> 03:24:10.950]  And now they flipped it around and gone,
[03:24:11.980 --> 03:24:14.401]  Oh, you know, the Congress won't even have a vote.
[03:24:14.541 --> 03:24:16.222]  Why are you doing that to the family?
[03:24:16.963 --> 03:24:18.724]  And it's so transparent.
[03:24:19.024 --> 03:24:20.245]  I mean, I watch the public.
[03:24:21.285 --> 03:24:24.307]  And they are just so timid and weak.
[03:24:24.347 --> 03:24:29.349]  I even see, like, big tough guys, you know, I'll sit there and watch people in public, and they're even insecure about what people think about them.
[03:24:29.830 --> 03:24:31.110]  I mean, you guys aren't like that.
[03:24:31.130 --> 03:24:33.151]  I guess because you're in the media and have gotten over it or whatever.
[03:24:33.171 --> 03:24:34.052]  I guess I got over it.
[03:24:34.092 --> 03:24:36.053]  But it's just everybody's so pathetic.
[03:24:36.153 --> 03:24:38.014]  I mean, it's like, it's so obvious.
[03:24:38.034 --> 03:24:41.436]  A bunch of slime is using these dead kids who probably ran the whole thing.
[03:24:41.676 --> 03:24:47.459]  And the magnitude of the people that have died in these other issues, like you're talking about Fast and Furious and other places, even Obama's drone strikes.
[03:24:47.479 --> 03:24:52.642]  I mean, we point out the hypocrisy of all of this to, yes, it's terrible that these children have died.
[03:24:53.022 --> 03:24:58.446]  But to take these 20 children, why are their lives so much more special?
[03:24:58.586 --> 03:25:00.547]  We talk about that for months and months and months.
[03:25:01.808 --> 03:25:09.721]  It's a giant psych warfare operation, and it's backfiring.
[03:25:10.161 --> 03:25:13.186]  I can look at it politically, but also in my gut, tell they're freaked out.
[03:25:13.206 --> 03:25:14.628]  And they're going to do some more shootings.
[03:25:14.989 --> 03:25:15.910]  That's the big problem.
[03:25:17.199 --> 03:25:22.860]  They could stage one any day now, and they've got all sorts of mental patients wound up right now with the guns, trying to get them to go into school.
[03:25:23.020 --> 03:25:27.881]  And they keep saying the kids, the kids, and, you know, remember last year the big Kony 2012 deal?
[03:25:27.921 --> 03:25:33.062]  They were like, we gotta go in Africa and save the kids from this guy who's probably been dead for ten plus years.
[03:25:33.082 --> 03:25:34.323]  Now hadn't been seen for seven, yeah.
[03:25:34.343 --> 03:25:44.185]  Yeah, and then, I think it was last week, the week before, they had the kids for the Free Syrian Army, running around with the AK-47, throwing dynamite around, and nobody seemed to care about that.
[03:25:44.929 --> 03:25:48.591]  No, no, it's like they're trying to give everybody multiple personalities.
[03:25:48.951 --> 03:25:56.276]  You have a personality that cares about violence and bad things, but they trigger it when they want, but then your other personality laughs at it.
[03:25:57.372 --> 03:26:00.834]  It's like, hey, we killed a million Iraqis over the last 15 years.
[03:26:00.854 --> 03:26:01.335]  It's terrible.
[03:26:01.355 --> 03:26:02.535]  I'm like, shut up, traitor.
[03:26:02.936 --> 03:26:11.261]  Well, you know, part of it might be that if you kill 500,000 kids in Iraq with your sanctions and you say it's worth it, like Madeleine Albright did, people can't get their head around that.
[03:26:11.321 --> 03:26:18.326]  But if you get them 26 kids and you show the parents and you show the faces and you do it over and over and over again, now that's a tragedy.
[03:26:18.346 --> 03:26:23.029]  You made me just think you want to do a stand up deal for the news tonight where, you know, like you point out her.
[03:26:23.549 --> 03:26:24.830]  Who was it on NBC going?
[03:26:24.870 --> 03:26:25.611]  I think it was worth it.
[03:26:25.631 --> 03:26:25.991]  500,000 kids.
[03:26:28.393 --> 03:26:29.674]  And she's admired.
[03:26:30.635 --> 03:26:33.577]  When Brzezinski goes up on stage, he's a rock star.
[03:26:33.597 --> 03:26:34.518]  He's killed so many people.
[03:26:34.979 --> 03:26:38.101]  But what they admire is he did it by funding other groups.
[03:26:38.141 --> 03:26:41.625]  He brags in his books, I couldn't kill 30% of the Cambodians.
[03:26:43.226 --> 03:26:46.148]  But I funded the groups to get it done.
[03:26:46.168 --> 03:26:47.790]  And they're like, oh, that's really slick.
[03:26:48.110 --> 03:26:51.011]  Because then it's like English in pool or something.
[03:26:51.031 --> 03:26:53.432]  You know, it's like, ooh, ah, and they admire it.
[03:26:53.752 --> 03:26:54.652]  Oh, you're so manly.
[03:26:54.692 --> 03:26:56.893]  It's like Richard Perle, known as the Prince of Darkness one time.
[03:26:56.913 --> 03:26:57.733]  It was in the New York Times.
[03:26:58.174 --> 03:26:59.134]  But they were saying how cool it was.
[03:26:59.154 --> 03:27:01.795]  He walked up to a bunch of women, good-looking women at a party.
[03:27:02.315 --> 03:27:05.716]  They got always like 400 pounds, you know, giant black circles around his eyes.
[03:27:05.736 --> 03:27:06.337]  I mean, I do too.
[03:27:06.357 --> 03:27:09.318]  But the point is, he walks up and goes, I order strikes.
[03:27:09.418 --> 03:27:10.138]  I kill people.
[03:27:10.578 --> 03:27:15.862]  And even these evil women who slaughtered the New World Order were turned off by the fact that it's not cool to go, I kill people.
[03:27:16.523 --> 03:27:19.725]  And that guy couldn't kill anybody, you know, with his bare hands if his life depended on it.
[03:27:20.086 --> 03:27:23.689]  I mean, it's just a big fat wimp thinking killing people's cool!
[03:27:24.278 --> 03:27:27.699]  And then we've got his Republican counterpart, Kissinger, right?
[03:27:27.859 --> 03:27:28.459]  Yeah.
[03:27:28.479 --> 03:27:29.639]  The counterpart to Brzezinski.
[03:27:30.180 --> 03:27:36.721]  And WikiLeaks had a document leaked this week that said, the illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little longer.
[03:27:36.761 --> 03:27:38.302]  That's why they're dragging this thing out.
[03:27:38.422 --> 03:27:40.422]  They know it's unconstitutional, and it is.
[03:27:40.502 --> 03:27:40.963]  It's registered.
[03:27:40.983 --> 03:27:44.143]  And plus, when they change the original laws, it wrecks societies.
[03:27:44.884 --> 03:27:47.524]  I mean, we're going to become like Mexico or North Korea very quickly.
[03:27:48.044 --> 03:27:49.845]  They get rid of this, nothing's going to work anymore.
[03:27:51.181 --> 03:27:52.922]  Yeah, I don't think they realize that though.
[03:27:52.982 --> 03:27:57.305]  I mean, you got so many people there, they're going off emotion instead of common sense.
[03:27:57.325 --> 03:27:59.887]  Well sure, the grassroots morons don't, but the technocrats do.
[03:27:59.907 --> 03:28:02.148]  They're all getting offshore islands with private security details.
[03:28:03.309 --> 03:28:05.450]  I mean, this is how you destroy civilization.
[03:28:06.191 --> 03:28:07.692]  Tyrants destroy civilization.
[03:28:08.292 --> 03:28:09.333]  Rome fell from within.
[03:28:09.353 --> 03:28:14.637]  And since they have no vision, even if... Man, these people are out of control.
[03:28:14.777 --> 03:28:16.578]  Alex in Illinois, last caller we have time for.
[03:28:16.598 --> 03:28:17.979]  Apologize to the loaded phones.
[03:28:18.419 --> 03:28:19.099]  Alex, you're on the air.
[03:28:19.139 --> 03:28:19.560]  Take us out.
[03:28:20.698 --> 03:28:21.398]  Uh, you can hear me?
[03:28:21.718 --> 03:28:22.339]  Yes, sir!
[03:28:23.179 --> 03:28:26.681]  Okay, hello Mr. Jones and friends, this is Alex from Chirac.
[03:28:26.901 --> 03:28:28.441]  Transform and roll out!
[03:28:28.601 --> 03:28:28.881]  Sorry.
[03:28:30.042 --> 03:28:30.802]  It's all good.
[03:28:31.062 --> 03:28:36.244]  I spoke to you regarding the bottom of the rabbit hole and you gave a very eloquent, passionate response.
[03:28:36.284 --> 03:28:38.645]  Yeah, that's on prisonplanet.tv if you want to see it again.
[03:28:38.665 --> 03:28:40.166]  Yeah, I saw that under the, uh, ranch.
[03:28:40.186 --> 03:28:40.826]  The ranch, yeah.
[03:28:40.846 --> 03:28:43.247]  But I think the rabbit hole is akin to the abyss.
[03:28:43.307 --> 03:28:47.109]  When you look at the bottom of the abyss or the rabbit hole, you see yourself reflected.
[03:28:47.729 --> 03:28:59.834]  And with the modernized genocide of the individual and the motives behind these banksters and New World Order members, I think we must look to the problems within to solve the problems outside.
[03:29:00.335 --> 03:29:02.095]  Primarily, when is enough enough?
[03:29:02.676 --> 03:29:03.756]  Is it ever going to be enough?
[03:29:04.316 --> 03:29:07.698]  And what sins of human beings are causing this rot in the apple?
[03:29:08.425 --> 03:29:09.586]  You're a great caller.
[03:29:10.227 --> 03:29:10.767]  Listen to this.
[03:29:11.208 --> 03:29:12.088]  Stand your ground.
[03:29:12.128 --> 03:29:13.509]  Don't fire unless fired upon.
[03:29:14.010 --> 03:29:16.332]  But if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.
[03:29:16.892 --> 03:29:21.176]  And that was the militia captain John Parker at Lexington Green on April 19, 1776.
[03:29:21.857 --> 03:29:23.858]  Or was it 1775?
[03:29:24.499 --> 03:29:28.422]  The point is, I'm going from memory there because I can't see the quote up on InfoWars.com.
[03:29:28.442 --> 03:29:30.504]  We have that front page image of the Oath Keeper.
[03:29:30.524 --> 03:29:31.725]  They were trying to block his sign.
[03:29:32.526 --> 03:29:33.427]  And there he is.
[03:29:33.447 --> 03:29:35.689]  And that's why they were so freaked out by it.
[03:29:36.209 --> 03:29:37.349]  You know, stand your ground.
[03:29:37.730 --> 03:29:38.970]  Don't fire unless fired upon.
[03:29:39.010 --> 03:29:41.991]  But they're already firing on our water, our vaccines, our food.
[03:29:42.211 --> 03:29:44.292]  The war has already begun, to quote Patrick Henry.
[03:29:44.772 --> 03:29:45.593]  It's an info war.
[03:29:45.673 --> 03:29:47.633]  They want to make it physical because they're losing this one.
[03:29:48.074 --> 03:29:49.774]  Join us tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:29:49.794 --> 03:29:50.855]  Get your friends and family to watch.
[03:29:51.135 --> 03:29:53.316]  7 o'clock central, InfoWars Nightly News.
