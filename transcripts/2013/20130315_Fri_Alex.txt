[00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.689]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.271]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:12.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:17.017]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:21.101]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:34.897]  Hard to believe it's Friday and this week went by really fast.
[00:00:34.897 --> 00:00:37.739]  It is the 15th day of March, the Ides of March.
[00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.002]  I just, that just clicked in my mind.
[00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.824]  You know, the Romans always thought March was unlucky.
[00:00:43.824 --> 00:00:47.407]  The month of Mars, the month of war.
[00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:51.310]  Well, lucky to launch wars, but unlucky for leaders.
[00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.516]  And Julius Caesar was stabbed to death in the Roman Senate by Brutus and his other confidants.
[00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:03.044]  On this day, more than 2,000 years ago.
[00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:08.088]  And it is the Ides of March.
[00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:12.912]  Beware the Ides of March.
[00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:19.537]  There is a tide, and the affairs of men, when taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.
[00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:26.543]  And that, of course, is William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
[00:01:27.927 --> 00:01:29.969]  And what is the fortune I seek?
[00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.453]  I seek liberty and freedom and a future for my children and a future for your children.
[00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:37.676]  Not because I'm some bleeding heart good guy, even.
[00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:39.038]  I love humanity.
[00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:40.959]  I want us to survive.
[00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:51.770]  I don't want to turn the world over to a bunch of mentally ill globalists that are so cravenly confident and are circling destroyed societies like giant buzzards.
[00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:56.326]  I want to stop these people from wrecking society.
[00:01:56.326 --> 00:01:58.769]  I want to survive and thrive.
[00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:01.732]  And I believe that is our destiny if we take it by the horns.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.362]  Well, it's a big broadcast today.
[00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:06.703]  Larry Pratt joins us.
[00:02:06.703 --> 00:02:07.604]  I'll tell you about that.
[00:02:07.604 --> 00:02:09.506]  A lot of breaking news.
[00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:20.435]  The whole rundown on the attack on the Second Amendment, where we are, battlefield projection, analysis, full spectrum, three-dimensional breakdown, top-down, from the state, federal, to the international level.
[00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:21.036]  It is March.
[00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:22.217]  They're trying to ram through the U.N.
[00:02:22.217 --> 00:02:24.058]  Treaty right now.
[00:02:24.058 --> 00:02:27.842]  The enemy has now shown themselves how they're planning to get our guns in the next phase.
[00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:29.919]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:44.982]  And then Joel Skousen, who really is very intelligent and extremely informed, in my view, when it comes to geopolitical power structures and the three different power groupings worldwide that are also interlocked at certain levels, but also stab each other in the backs.
[00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:48.282]  We're going to be getting him on to break down Iran.
[00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:52.503]  But more importantly, North Korea says prepares to strike.
[00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:58.064]  Kim Jong-un supervises live artillery drill as inflammatory threats continue.
[00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:17.063]  And of course, if you don't know who Kim Jong-un is, he's the cartoon character, Joke, third-generational dictator, who a year ago, when his dad died, was a wide-eyed little, you know, 20-something-year-old kid from Switzerland at the boarding school he'd been at the last 20 years.
[00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:20.145]  And if you expand on that now,
[00:03:22.082 --> 00:03:38.617]  Now Kim Jong-un, in just a year in power, has a craven look in his face, completely insane, running around saying, nuke everyone, I'm all powerful, because he's surrounded by a bunch of people drunk on the blood of their fellow humans.
[00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:44.442]  And so I have said that I'm totally anti-war when it's offensive.
[00:03:45.362 --> 00:03:52.544]  But when you are openly running around threatening to attack people, I mean, he's up there doing North Korean artillery drills?
[00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:54.584]  Take him out!
[00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:57.385]  You know, saying, I'm about to attack you and aiming weapons?
[00:03:57.385 --> 00:03:58.025]  Boom, that's it.
[00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:01.186]  I mean, you come to my house, have a gun in your hand, say, I'm about to shoot you?
[00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:05.427]  I'm not gonna say anything to you, I'm gonna get a gun as quickly as I can and shoot you.
[00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:10.628]  You got free speech until you call for violence.
[00:04:10.628 --> 00:04:14.569]  You got free speech until you say, I'm aiming guns at you and I'm gonna kill you.
[00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:17.058]  I mean, look at that joke.
[00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:18.639]  And look at those lunatics around him.
[00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.680]  And I don't want a war.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.262]  Let's be clear about that.
[00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.022]  I don't want a war.
[00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:24.283]  The globalists are bad as well.
[00:04:24.283 --> 00:04:26.224]  They've launched all these illegal wars.
[00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:29.447]  Oh, Saddam's got weapons of mass destruction made up.
[00:04:29.447 --> 00:04:33.910]  A former CIA operative set him up, told him attack Iran, told him go into Kuwait.
[00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.851]  That was a purely evil war.
[00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:36.552]  Afghanistan.
[00:04:38.114 --> 00:04:42.156]  The stuff in Pakistan, the stuff in Libya, the stuff in Syria, totally wrong!
[00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:46.679]  But, this guy's now got nuclear weapons, saying he's gonna attack.
[00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:48.700]  Let him have it!
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.101]  Wipe him out!
[00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:51.522]  I mean, I've had enough of it!
[00:04:51.522 --> 00:04:53.022]  And I'm gonna explain that when we come back.
[00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:53.523]  Stay with us.
[00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:55.244]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:56.645]  I'm Alex Jones, M4Wars.com.
[00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:03.184]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:05:03.184 --> 00:05:08.206]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:15.369]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.154]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:25.178]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.110]  The workers.
[00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.710]  The strivers.
[00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.110]  The builders.
[00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:28.639]  These are our people.
[00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:31.961]  Who are they?
[00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:34.783]  They are the Dark Armies.
[00:08:34.783 --> 00:08:40.886]  The dark, murdering armies whose only honour is atrocity.
[00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:42.807]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:08:42.807 --> 00:08:46.770]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:09:12.796 --> 00:09:25.389]  It is Friday, the Ides of March, the day that Julius Caesar had daggers plunged into his chest and stomach and neck and face in the Roman Senate.
[00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:31.034]  A day of bad luck and ill omen for the New World Order, according to their ideas.
[00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:34.750]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live again.
[00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.512]  This is the Death to Tyrants Day, at least for 2,000 plus years.
[00:09:38.512 --> 00:09:40.233]  That's how it's been seen.
[00:09:40.233 --> 00:09:42.494]  And we are going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:09:42.494 --> 00:09:48.697]  Larry Pratt with huge updates on the Second Amendment and the battle for human liberty coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:48.697 --> 00:09:50.938]  And we have Joel Skousen to look at North Korea.
[00:09:51.818 --> 00:09:54.860]  I've got some serious comments on that crisis in a moment.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.823]  And then here are the headlines that are coming up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:59.823 --> 00:10:00.884]  Let's just read them.
[00:10:00.884 --> 00:10:01.164]  U.S.
[00:10:01.164 --> 00:10:07.548]  Air Force plans to build huge network of underground tunnels, effort to make nuclear missiles less vulnerable to attack.
[00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:09.630]  They're telling you about something that's been around for 60 years.
[00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.631]  See, now it's just throw it all in your face.
[00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:12.432]  That's the old stuff.
[00:10:13.052 --> 00:10:18.198]  It's national security, government transparency hits record low in 2012 under Obama.
[00:10:18.198 --> 00:10:21.782]  Because he promised to be totally transparent, he's totally untransparent.
[00:10:21.782 --> 00:10:22.302]  U.S.
[00:10:22.302 --> 00:10:25.946]  Army colonel issues warning about remorseless killer robots.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.961]  Drones are the start of the rise of the machines.
[00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:32.422]  An official Pentagon warning.
[00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:35.123]  Ten giant media government hoaxes.
[00:10:35.123 --> 00:10:36.143]  Big article.
[00:10:36.143 --> 00:10:37.903]  Red-linked up at Infowars.com.
[00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:40.624]  The poll Watson and I put together last night.
[00:10:40.624 --> 00:10:44.005]  We wrote it yesterday, but it went up last night, so I reposted it.
[00:10:44.005 --> 00:10:45.566]  Top of Infowars.com.
[00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:46.426]  Red-linked.
[00:10:46.426 --> 00:10:47.146]  Very important.
[00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.127]  We'll go over that.
[00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:53.068]  We're going to get into ten hilarious examples of how clueless our leaders are about the economy.
[00:10:53.068 --> 00:10:55.009]  They're not clueless telling hilarious lies.
[00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.379]  So many people just go, oh, they're idiots.
[00:10:58.379 --> 00:11:00.482]  They're not idiots.
[00:11:00.482 --> 00:11:03.027]  I mean, they're running in PsyOps on us.
[00:11:03.027 --> 00:11:09.537]  Exclusive, Iran steps up weapons lifeline to Assad, as our government steps up aid to Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:11.195 --> 00:11:12.135]  Iran confronts U.S.
[00:11:12.135 --> 00:11:15.817]  drone over Persian Gulf, and they're like, it was deadly, there may be war over this.
[00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:23.380]  And then you read later, the plane flew 16 miles away in Iranian airspace on the edge of international waters, and it could fly anywhere it wanted.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:31.403]  It's like, unbelievable, it confronted a deadly, this may cause a war, our jets were launched, it's incredible, and then it's like, by the way, the jet was 16 miles away.
[00:11:32.023 --> 00:11:34.526]  Well, that's a carpet bomb, then.
[00:11:34.526 --> 00:11:36.389]  They're against Al Qaeda.
[00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:37.089]  Also, U.S.
[00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:42.556]  General puts troops on security alert after Karzai's anti-American, anti-U.S.
[00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:43.057]  statements.
[00:11:43.057 --> 00:11:44.739]  It wasn't anti-U.S.
[00:11:44.739 --> 00:11:46.060]  statements by the globalist puppet.
[00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:50.969]  Who now has come out and said our government runs Al Qaeda and is staging terror attacks over there.
[00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:51.830]  That's well known.
[00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.231]  I don't just believe him.
[00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:54.872]  That's well known.
[00:11:54.872 --> 00:11:56.393]  Our government isn't our government.
[00:11:56.393 --> 00:11:59.175]  It is the worst of the worst.
[00:11:59.175 --> 00:12:00.316]  I don't want Putin running us.
[00:12:00.316 --> 00:12:02.117]  I don't want the Chai Koms running us.
[00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:04.339]  But the globalists are the ones here running us.
[00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:05.039]  They're the worst.
[00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:05.960]  That's why they're in charge.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.661]  They're the best.
[00:12:07.731 --> 00:12:08.832]  Killing is their business.
[00:12:08.832 --> 00:12:09.853]  Lying is their business.
[00:12:09.853 --> 00:12:13.776]  And let me tell you, their business is good.
[00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:15.637]  So, that's some of the news.
[00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:18.939]  Ministry of Defense admits campaign in Afghanistan an unwinnable war.
[00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:20.200]  It's not meant to be won.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.765]  It's meant to go from 10% opium production to 93% opium production world supply.
[00:12:25.765 --> 00:12:28.687]  And to create jihadis that can export worldwide.
[00:12:30.503 --> 00:12:34.286]  Who don't know their bosses are double CIA Mossad agents.
[00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:39.369]  Pakistani intelligence, Saudi Arabian intelligence, MI6 intelligence.
[00:12:39.369 --> 00:12:43.892]  It's come out hundreds of times that Ammar al-Awlaki, they didn't really kill him.
[00:12:43.892 --> 00:12:45.653]  I predicted they'd have that stage killing.
[00:12:45.653 --> 00:12:48.415]  They just gave him a facelift and new identity.
[00:12:48.415 --> 00:12:53.118]  When it came out, he was secretly a CIA Pentagon top-level national security asset.
[00:12:53.118 --> 00:12:59.102]  Scores of meetings at the Pentagon, scores of meetings at Defense Intelligence, AP, Reuters, Fox News a few years ago.
[00:12:59.102 --> 00:13:00.263]  I told you he was an operative before that.
[00:13:01.085 --> 00:13:07.703]  Four of the five top Al Qaeda leaders, all born and raised in America, and their parents were CIA or Defense Intelligence or NSA.
[00:13:09.508 --> 00:13:12.350]  I mean, do you really believe any of that?
[00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:19.876]  The NSA and the CIA are the illegal foreign New World Order offshore banker takeover command bases.
[00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:29.444]  Like Legion of Doom floating cities of crime that set down in America to capture us and to use us as the engine of the global takeover.
[00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:32.026]  Not to spread liberty worldwide, but to spread tyranny.
[00:13:32.026 --> 00:13:33.267]  See, here's how my brain works.
[00:13:36.943 --> 00:13:50.248]  I see a Fox News Europe Sky Television, that's what it's called over there, video correspondent Mark Stone has been detained by Chinese police while filming in Beijing Tiananmen Square.
[00:13:50.248 --> 00:14:02.653]  He had authorization, he had the badges, he had it all, but because it was his personal power trip, they basically took him, detained him, interrogated him, took their stuff.
[00:14:02.653 --> 00:14:04.874]  And Sky Television is calling it authoritarian.
[00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:12.431]  Well, I've been in Chicago, I've been in Austin, I've been in New York.
[00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:13.352]  We have video of it.
[00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:15.633]  When Aaron Dyches was up here late last night, gets in today.
[00:14:15.633 --> 00:14:22.958]  I'm going to have him go find videos for himself, myself and others in Kansas City, in New York.
[00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:30.784]  I'm going to have him do a video on this, where cops come over, or even security guards with guns, when we're on the sidewalk.
[00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.913]  And scream and say, I'm gonna arrest you, no filming.
[00:14:35.913 --> 00:14:43.779]  And the security guards, a half mile from the Federal Reserve, drive over to where they're at, at a city park.
[00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:47.763]  They wanted a far away shot of the Federal Reserve and put their hands on their guns and say, leave.
[00:14:47.763 --> 00:14:50.765]  I mean, it was, in a real country, they would have gone to jail.
[00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:56.790]  I mean, if you or I just randomly walked up in a park with a gun and said, leave, leave or else it's gonna get bad.
[00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.092]  That's a total terroristic threat.
[00:14:59.092 --> 00:15:01.534]  Okay, I'm telling you right now, I'm gonna arrest you.
[00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:04.586]  You're not allowed to be here in Kansas City.
[00:15:04.586 --> 00:15:05.927]  Leave now.
[00:15:05.927 --> 00:15:10.731]  And guys, you know, you can say discretion's the better part of valor.
[00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:14.654]  But then when the Kansas City Star called to cover it, they said it didn't happen.
[00:15:14.654 --> 00:15:19.157]  Video, 10-minute video, all in living color, did not happen, Kansas City Star.
[00:15:19.157 --> 00:15:23.881]  I mean, the Kansas City Star actually did an article about how it did happen and how the Federal Reserve just said didn't happen.
[00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:26.567]  And you're like, well, that doesn't make sense.
[00:15:26.567 --> 00:15:27.387]  It is creditsome.
[00:15:27.387 --> 00:15:28.788]  No, it's a psy-op.
[00:15:28.788 --> 00:15:30.249]  Because they just say, didn't happen.
[00:15:30.249 --> 00:15:31.770]  There are not two billion bullets.
[00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.931]  There are no drones.
[00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.032]  There is no police state.
[00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:37.494]  The Federal Reserve is federal.
[00:15:37.494 --> 00:15:42.358]  Because then you just stand there and then it lets them take the official position of authority.
[00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:47.902]  We're going to come with guns and tell you, you can't be on a sidewalk in Kansas City.
[00:15:47.902 --> 00:15:49.123]  And there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:15:49.123 --> 00:15:52.625]  And if you try to go file a complaint with the police, they'll just say, get out of here.
[00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:54.767]  You see, that's the essence of tyranny.
[00:15:55.526 --> 00:15:58.008]  Here in Austin?
[00:15:58.008 --> 00:16:01.911]  We've had the police many times over the years say, you cannot film us from 100 yards away.
[00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:05.574]  Because you can be 5 feet away when they're doing something and that's interfering.
[00:16:05.574 --> 00:16:14.220]  But no, they'll arrest you now, or try to, but there were lawsuits, they lost those, and then you can film police in Austin.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.224]  But not in areas where they've gotten the upper hand and intimidated people, it's now Communist China.
[00:16:19.224 --> 00:16:19.944]  Where they've killed
[00:16:21.325 --> 00:16:22.426]  60 to 80 million other people.
[00:16:22.426 --> 00:16:23.127]  No one really knows.
[00:16:23.127 --> 00:16:25.148]  It's over 60 million, conservatively.
[00:16:25.148 --> 00:16:28.070]  And so, again, that's what we're converting over to.
[00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.771]  That's what we're becoming.
[00:16:29.771 --> 00:16:31.373]  That's what's happening to us.
[00:16:31.373 --> 00:16:32.614]  And let me explain something.
[00:16:32.614 --> 00:16:42.641]  Last week, I was breaking down how much I don't like Kim Jong-il or his father, the first, or Kim Jong-un, the horrible little demon son.
[00:16:42.641 --> 00:16:45.203]  And some people are like, well, Alex, why are you calling for war?
[00:16:46.544 --> 00:16:49.586]  You know, why are you saying I'd like to see the government carpet-bombed?
[00:16:49.586 --> 00:16:53.969]  People spun that, I saw it on YouTube and said that I was calling for carpet-bombing of the North Korean people.
[00:16:53.969 --> 00:17:06.278]  No, I was calling for the carpet-bombing of the 1% Inner Communist Party and the 9% below them, roughly.
[00:17:06.278 --> 00:17:13.363]  And... I was simply trying to point out that the ultimate expression
[00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:19.712]  I'm just off the chart evil.
[00:17:19.712 --> 00:17:29.177]  In the world is North Korea backed up by Communist China who we've given all our industry to by making the regulations and taxes so high you can't operate unless you're in China.
[00:17:29.177 --> 00:17:31.018]  It's even destroying the other third world countries.
[00:17:31.018 --> 00:17:33.439]  Everything's going to China and it's destroying the Chinese people.
[00:17:33.439 --> 00:17:34.759]  It's not building them up.
[00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:35.420]  It's so horrible.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.321]  Their major companies have, you know, suicide nets around them, literally.
[00:17:40.097 --> 00:17:52.384]  And now they're building the robots, the first one million and four million at Foxconn to replace humans, period.
[00:17:52.384 --> 00:18:09.594]  And it makes me mad because I can look at the evil in the eyes of the communist leadership in North Korea and the craven power trips, the demonic look, the behavior, people crying for days if you didn't cry long enough, when Kim Jong-il, the filth, may he rest in hell forever, may he rot in hell forever,
[00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:12.872]  Just incredibly demonic.
[00:18:12.872 --> 00:18:17.193]  I mean, you know, Vlad the Impaler level, off the chart.
[00:18:17.193 --> 00:18:20.515]  And then his demonic son, knowing they're perched on people.
[00:18:20.515 --> 00:18:23.316]  But see, then that doesn't mean our government or the globalists are good.
[00:18:23.316 --> 00:18:24.796]  They'd love to be able to do all that.
[00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:25.837]  They have the same spirit.
[00:18:26.553 --> 00:18:30.034]  But he's now saying, we'll nuke LA, we'll nuke San Francisco.
[00:18:30.034 --> 00:18:31.655]  These are all public televised quotes.
[00:18:31.655 --> 00:18:33.515]  These are on record.
[00:18:33.515 --> 00:18:34.916]  We'll attack South Korea.
[00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:37.417]  Today, North Korean prepares to strike.
[00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:38.317]  That's a quote.
[00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:44.539]  Kim Jong-un supervises live artillery drill as inflammatory threats continue.
[00:18:44.539 --> 00:18:48.740]  And so the globalists are probably going to do a false flag and blame it on them and then blow them up anyways.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:54.062]  My whole issue is, under common law, when someone's saying, I'm going to attack you,
[00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:56.846]  I'm going to strike you.
[00:18:56.846 --> 00:19:00.469]  I'm going to go after you.
[00:19:00.469 --> 00:19:02.851]  I'm going to kill you.
[00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:06.094]  That's not free speech.
[00:19:06.094 --> 00:19:14.281]  I mean, if somebody says, on record, I'm coming to your house to kill you, if that person showed up at your house and you killed them, you wouldn't go to jail, folks.
[00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:16.143]  Or if you did, the grand jury would, you know,
[00:19:17.692 --> 00:19:21.654]  99% of the time under common law, you wouldn't get in trouble because they said, I'm coming to kill you.
[00:19:21.654 --> 00:19:23.595]  Well, he's saying, I'm coming to kill you.
[00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:24.676]  I'm coming to kill you.
[00:19:24.676 --> 00:19:28.718]  And it just shows because every other major country has double dealing going on.
[00:19:28.718 --> 00:19:30.819]  China with the globalists, Russia with the globalists.
[00:19:30.819 --> 00:19:36.062]  They're all corrupt, evil regimes, you know, using the latest systems of control, but competing with each other for control.
[00:19:36.062 --> 00:19:39.324]  North Korea is completely delusional in La La Land.
[00:19:39.924 --> 00:19:48.991]  Run by a stunted little entertainment head hanging out with Dennis Rodman, and I just instinctively want to smash him into a pile of pus.
[00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:50.893]  I want to stomp him into oblivion.
[00:19:50.893 --> 00:19:53.194]  Now that doesn't mean that's literally going to happen.
[00:19:53.194 --> 00:19:55.556]  It just means I'm calling it like it is.
[00:19:55.556 --> 00:20:00.920]  If anybody could be struck now, it's North Korean leadership, and I'd love to see them deadered in a hammer.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.541]  If you're listening,
[00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:04.704]  You know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.948]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:10.751]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.894]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:20:12.894 --> 00:20:15.857]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoodsDirect.

[00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:16.034]  We're good.
[00:21:32.449 --> 00:21:32.749]  I think so.
[00:21:59.773 --> 00:22:02.554]  Is there such a thing as gluten-free emergency kits?
[00:22:02.554 --> 00:22:03.294]  Yes!

[00:22:30.607 --> 00:22:35.170]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:40.974]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:40.974 --> 00:22:44.616]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:07.614 --> 00:23:11.178]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:23:11.178 --> 00:23:17.584]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:23:17.584 --> 00:23:20.127]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:24:16.215 --> 00:24:17.579]  Alex Jones here back live.
[00:24:17.579 --> 00:24:21.510]  Just to finish up the story I was getting into that I'm going to have Aaron cover on the Nightly News tonight.
[00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.352]  A piece we're putting together.
[00:24:23.792 --> 00:24:31.275]  I've been all over the country, and just this year in Austin, they told Molly Rogers, one of our photographers, is just walking around downtown.
[00:24:31.275 --> 00:24:37.657]  I told her, go downtown, get photos of this issue on Big Brother, show big groupings of surveillance cameras.
[00:24:37.657 --> 00:24:51.443]  So she's downtown, there's a federal courthouse, she's across the street, taking photos of the cameras, and the federal police come out and say, we'll arrest you as a terrorist, this is on record, if you don't stop taking photos.
[00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.912]  I mean, they've charged people with life in prison in Illinois.
[00:24:55.912 --> 00:25:15.262]  Now, it was thrown out of court, but the state tried, came down to the county and tried to make sure the guy went to jail for filming police at his old car shop where they were hauling him away because they changed the zoning where his family had been for generations out at their junkyard to come and haul off their old cars.
[00:25:16.512 --> 00:25:18.255]  And you see those cases.
[00:25:18.255 --> 00:25:25.604]  So when it's here and my reporter's told you'll be arrested if you take photos of the federal building or I hire a street team.
[00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:37.721]  The Mainline Street team that's worked down there for years, there's a couple of companies, they've got a bunch of attractive young women to hand stuff out, and they've done it thousands of times, some of them.
[00:25:37.721 --> 00:25:40.063]  I mean, do it five, six days a week for years.
[00:25:40.063 --> 00:25:41.564]  They go, this has never happened.
[00:25:41.564 --> 00:25:44.467]  We're not allowed to hand out your magazine, and gave them tickets.
[00:25:44.467 --> 00:25:47.869]  And we show the photos, we show the video, and people do one of two things.
[00:25:47.869 --> 00:25:51.292]  They say, that's not real, because America, we don't do that.
[00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:55.356]  Or, good, you shouldn't be able to hand out a magazine free, on the sidewalk, anywhere.
[00:25:56.465 --> 00:26:05.329]  So then I go down and protest, and Chronicle employees who run South by Southwest walk by me into the convention center going, Get a life, Alex!
[00:26:05.329 --> 00:26:06.829]  In fact, I was live on the radio.
[00:26:06.829 --> 00:26:10.991]  I was the only one out on the radio who were jacked in on the local affiliate that Saturday.
[00:26:10.991 --> 00:26:12.832]  I came back last Saturday and protested.
[00:26:12.832 --> 00:26:17.814]  And they would walk by, they'd come to the windows and flip me off, and they'd come to the windows with their badges, you know, their little
[00:26:18.354 --> 00:26:20.676]  Official badgers just talk trash about me.
[00:26:20.676 --> 00:26:22.077]  You can see them through the big windows.
[00:26:22.077 --> 00:26:24.219]  You know, one floor above me looking down.
[00:26:24.219 --> 00:26:25.780]  How dare me!
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.181]  Want to hand something out!
[00:26:27.181 --> 00:26:29.943]  And I went down there and I said, I'm going to sue the police.
[00:26:29.943 --> 00:26:31.305]  I'm going to sue the code enforcers.
[00:26:31.305 --> 00:26:32.225]  I'm going to sue you!
[00:26:32.225 --> 00:26:32.746]  Back off!
[00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:45.867]  So then I left and then big muscle guys, big shaved head guys with tattoos all over them showed up and went to the same women, you know, 25 year old women and said stuff like, you better watch it.
[00:26:45.867 --> 00:26:47.548]  You're not allowed to do that.
[00:26:47.548 --> 00:26:49.289]  I'm here with South by Southwest.
[00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:52.191]  I mean, just right out of, right out of Goodfellas.
[00:26:52.191 --> 00:26:56.534]  You don't operate a business in this city without you going through us.
[00:26:56.534 --> 00:26:57.174]  And that's what they said.
[00:26:57.174 --> 00:27:00.597]  They said, you need to be a sponsor of South by Southwest.
[00:27:00.597 --> 00:27:03.359]  And that means money, money, girl.
[00:27:04.139 --> 00:27:05.840]  Money!
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.741]  And I'm supposed to just get a life and go, hey!
[00:27:09.741 --> 00:27:10.961]  Yeah, man!
[00:27:10.961 --> 00:27:13.983]  What, I think I could hand something out in America?
[00:27:13.983 --> 00:27:14.983]  I do need to get a life.
[00:27:14.983 --> 00:27:15.743]  I'm a weirdo!
[00:27:15.743 --> 00:27:20.525]  I mean, because I, at a primitive level, not looking for a fight, because I've been in it.
[00:27:20.525 --> 00:27:21.245]  I've been in the hospital.
[00:27:21.245 --> 00:27:22.225]  I've been hurt a lot of times.
[00:27:22.225 --> 00:27:28.588]  I mean, I'm the type of guy, somebody starts fighting me, I don't care how big they are, how mean they are, they come get in my face, I go completely caveman.
[00:27:28.588 --> 00:27:29.128]  I can't help it.
[00:27:30.225 --> 00:27:33.127]  Sometimes they, you know, don't ever get out of the hospital.
[00:27:33.127 --> 00:27:38.692]  But the point here is that, is that I tell you, I mean, the guy does that to me, including police.
[00:27:38.692 --> 00:27:43.456]  I've had Austin cops say, you can't film, you can't protest, and it's on video, I blow up.
[00:27:43.456 --> 00:27:47.779]  Because, I mean, I just, this is criminal.
[00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:58.268]  I mean, if you think it's a good deal to have a good fella come up to you and tell you in America you don't have any rights, well then you're a slave and you're begging for it.
[00:27:58.268 --> 00:27:59.569]  You're begging for it!
[00:28:00.694 --> 00:28:02.515]  You're begging for it!
[00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:22.812]  I mean it makes me extremely angry to even imagine that repeatedly men claiming to work for South by Southwest came over after they got police to illegally harass us and then they backed off because they realized it was criminal, code enforcers to criminally do it, then they backed off, and then
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.609]  But I always loved the mind games, like, get a life, Alex!
[00:28:27.609 --> 00:28:29.214]  That was what they walked by repeatedly.
[00:28:29.214 --> 00:28:29.896]  Get a life!
[00:28:29.896 --> 00:28:31.259]  And I'd say, come back here!
[00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:32.202]  And they would run in the building.
[00:28:33.302 --> 00:28:34.203]  Because they're cowards.
[00:28:34.203 --> 00:28:35.864]  You get a life!
[00:28:35.864 --> 00:28:36.664]  You get a life!
[00:28:36.664 --> 00:28:42.829]  I don't want my kids growing up in a country where you can't talk to people on the street, where you can't say, would you like a magazine?
[00:28:42.829 --> 00:28:55.618]  The truth is you didn't like five women downtown, all over downtown, handing out 10,000 magazines, 10,000 brochures on Infowars.com, which was a small little thing we did.
[00:28:56.198 --> 00:28:57.499]  We're just testing it out.
[00:28:57.499 --> 00:28:57.880]  And you know what?
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.762]  I'm going to do it all the time now because you don't like it.
[00:28:59.762 --> 00:29:01.563]  And by the way, it was a big success.
[00:29:01.563 --> 00:29:03.845]  Anything we do is a success by the grace of God.
[00:29:03.845 --> 00:29:06.408]  You are a joke!
[00:29:06.408 --> 00:29:07.969]  And I've still got my spirit.
[00:29:07.969 --> 00:29:09.431]  I've still got my will.
[00:29:09.431 --> 00:29:10.192]  I'm nothing special.
[00:29:11.493 --> 00:29:15.756]  Nothing special when some goons first police than others.
[00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:21.460]  And the police are like, we're sorry, we've been ordered... I'm supposed to give you a ticket, but here's a warning.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.641]  You know, I don't get mad at that.
[00:29:22.641 --> 00:29:23.802]  None of the cops were enjoying it.
[00:29:23.802 --> 00:29:26.464]  It's bad they followed the bad order.
[00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:30.807]  But it's not like goons who were really, you know, like going, you better watch it, honey.
[00:29:30.807 --> 00:29:32.088]  This is my street.
[00:29:32.088 --> 00:29:33.829]  You need to spend money to be out here.
[00:29:33.829 --> 00:29:34.530]  You understand?
[00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.112]  Get out of here or things are going to get bad.
[00:29:37.112 --> 00:29:38.413]  That gets me like just...
[00:29:39.613 --> 00:29:44.495]  Oh my God, it makes... And by the way, they had to call the police on him to run him off.
[00:29:44.495 --> 00:29:46.715]  They should have been thrown in handcuffs.
[00:29:46.715 --> 00:29:47.936]  I mean, I've had enough!
[00:29:47.936 --> 00:29:49.556]  I've had enough!
[00:29:49.556 --> 00:29:50.956]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.956 --> 00:29:53.497]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.497 --> 00:29:56.178]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.338 --> 00:30:05.599]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:09.162]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.162 --> 00:30:11.785]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:11.785 --> 00:30:17.650]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:23.876]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.296 --> 00:30:30.280]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.463]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.463 --> 00:30:38.746]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:38.746 --> 00:30:44.690]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:48.253]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.253 --> 00:30:50.234]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.234 --> 00:30:50.655]  It's here.

[00:32:29.161 --> 00:32:35.345]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

[00:33:14.393 --> 00:33:18.114]  I gotta have another shot of liberty.
[00:33:18.114 --> 00:33:22.076]  Cause what you got is all that I need.
[00:33:22.076 --> 00:33:23.237]  Monday through Friday.

[00:33:31.025 --> 00:33:34.007]  Let me give out the toll-free number.
[00:33:34.007 --> 00:33:36.029]  Wide open, open lines Friday.

[00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.532]  Trying to keep you on hold forever.
[00:33:39.532 --> 00:33:39.592]  800-259-9231.
[00:33:39.592 --> 00:33:40.773]  It's just that 800-259-9231.
[00:33:40.773 --> 00:33:44.776]  Every time I hear about, can't film police in Russia selectively, it's big news.
[00:33:44.776 --> 00:33:45.797]  Can't film in China.
[00:33:53.963 --> 00:33:56.046]  Of the police selectively.
[00:33:56.046 --> 00:33:58.128]  Big news!
[00:33:58.128 --> 00:33:59.389]  Happens in African countries.
[00:33:59.389 --> 00:34:00.210]  Big news!
[00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:02.473]  Chavez, you know, grabbing reporters.
[00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:03.274]  Big news!
[00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:04.035]  Can you believe that?
[00:34:04.035 --> 00:34:04.875]  Chavez?
[00:34:04.875 --> 00:34:05.997]  Yeah, I don't like it when he does it!
[00:34:07.073 --> 00:34:10.314]  They're like, you don't like Shafiz of America's government's bad?
[00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:12.215]  Doesn't that make him good?
[00:34:12.215 --> 00:34:20.217]  No, again, if I'm in a football, outdoor football game or something, and there's 15 porta-potties, it's not like, well, I want a drink out of that porta-potty, but, you know, that one's bad.
[00:34:20.217 --> 00:34:21.538]  They're all bad.
[00:34:21.538 --> 00:34:24.759]  That's common sense, what our founders taught us, what history shows us.
[00:34:24.759 --> 00:34:25.579]  It's all bad.
[00:34:25.579 --> 00:34:26.979]  I don't want any of it.
[00:34:26.979 --> 00:34:29.420]  And I'm not signing up to any groups.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.380]  I want liberty.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.701]  That's what unifies.
[00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:33.982]  A code that we live by.
[00:34:33.982 --> 00:34:34.822]  Due process.
[00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.711]  Free speech, honored and protected.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:40.032]  That's what I'm into.
[00:34:40.032 --> 00:34:43.094]  And that's what unifies us as individuals.
[00:34:43.094 --> 00:34:44.535]  But they don't want that.
[00:34:44.535 --> 00:34:51.219]  They want to think like a group, so you can be controlled, so they can just control people through the leaders of the groups.
[00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:52.620]  That's the globalist model.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.461]  That's what they openly talk about.
[00:34:54.461 --> 00:35:01.526]  Zbigniew Brzezinski's written four or five books, I've read them all, on the subject of how the government controls criminal elements worldwide.
[00:35:02.728 --> 00:35:10.334]  And that's the rationale to run everything from drug dealing to money laundering to child kidnapping to snuff films.
[00:35:10.334 --> 00:35:14.538]  Oh yeah, and then the excuses, well that's how we control it to keep control of it.
[00:35:14.538 --> 00:35:17.200]  No, that's what you're into.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.302]  The raw exercise of power.
[00:35:20.302 --> 00:35:25.066]  If you were really powerful, you'd want to turn humanity loose.
[00:35:25.066 --> 00:35:28.289]  If you were really confident, the truth is you're not.
[00:35:28.289 --> 00:35:29.390]  The truth is you're afraid.
[00:35:31.448 --> 00:35:33.310]  So that's the article out of Sky Television.
[00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.391]  You know, big news.
[00:35:34.391 --> 00:35:36.894]  That's worldwide news on Sky TV.
[00:35:36.894 --> 00:35:41.199]  Sky Asia Correspondent, Mark Stone, reporting from Human Square.
[00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:42.520]  Why wasn't it news?
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.063]  CBS News, News 8, a couple others came out.
[00:35:45.063 --> 00:35:46.805]  Only a few of them even did reports.
[00:35:46.805 --> 00:35:48.807]  And it was just like, police will not enforce...
[00:35:50.169 --> 00:35:53.152]  Uh, pamploning ordinance steering South by Southwest.
[00:35:53.152 --> 00:35:55.194]  Not that the ordinance is unconstitutional.
[00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:59.840]  Not that the police revolted and refused to enforce it after I pointed out it was wrong.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.943]  Not that they, no no no, not that I called them, not that I had a demonstration.
[00:36:02.943 --> 00:36:04.345]  Because you want to ignore Alex Jones.
[00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:05.065]  Well, you know what?
[00:36:05.065 --> 00:36:07.107]  We have our own audience, our own listeners.
[00:36:07.107 --> 00:36:13.591]  We have real media friends out there, in talk radio, in the internet, in DrugsReport.com, and many others.
[00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:21.136]  And so, our signal's getting out, and people know, whenever they read something, out of the establishment, or see something, that it's filtered.
[00:36:21.136 --> 00:36:22.216]  They know that.
[00:36:22.216 --> 00:36:27.720]  You guys act like you're, you know, you have no bias, but then you have total biases, to spin everything.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.442]  I've got a bias, it's called freedom more of it.
[00:36:31.442 --> 00:36:32.943]  It's called being alive.
[00:36:32.943 --> 00:36:33.884]  It's called live wire.
[00:36:36.718 --> 00:36:52.370]  I went for a jog this morning, and I was just like, beautiful low clouds, the sun behind it, where it's all silhouetted, the trees, the wind, the leaves on the ground, the crispness, just the smell, being alive!
[00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.172]  It's so amazing!
[00:36:54.172 --> 00:36:55.553]  That's my bias.
[00:36:55.553 --> 00:36:56.534]  I'm gonna admit it.
[00:36:56.534 --> 00:36:56.914]  I have it.
[00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:58.355]  I'm crazed.
[00:36:58.355 --> 00:36:59.196]  I'm crazed for liberty.
[00:36:59.196 --> 00:36:59.656]  I'm awake.
[00:36:59.656 --> 00:37:00.997]  I'm alive.
[00:37:00.997 --> 00:37:04.120]  And I'm just tuned in to God's creation, and I just love it.
[00:37:05.336 --> 00:37:14.119]  And I see the globalists trying to shutter people, trying to dumb them down, trying to limit their horizons, trying to control them, trying to take their free will.
[00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:17.400]  And I don't even stand for anything.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.360]  I am what I am.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.861]  I want liberty.
[00:37:20.861 --> 00:37:23.181]  It's not like I even have to take a stand or have courage.
[00:37:23.181 --> 00:37:24.542]  This is what I do.
[00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.182]  I can't control myself.
[00:37:26.182 --> 00:37:28.383]  And I wish that that was infectious.
[00:37:28.383 --> 00:37:31.424]  I wish that that spirit of liberty that I know is out there.
[00:37:32.725 --> 00:37:35.706]  I read the Founding Fathers quotes.
[00:37:35.706 --> 00:37:38.087]  In my heart, I resonate with it.
[00:37:38.087 --> 00:37:42.108]  I resonate with all the philosophers that wanted liberty.
[00:37:42.108 --> 00:37:43.128]  Victor Hugo.
[00:37:43.128 --> 00:37:48.110]  The list goes on and on.
[00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:48.670]  Mark Twain.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.742]  Because they're really living and I want you to really live.
[00:37:53.742 --> 00:38:04.069]  And I see so many people who can't ever imagine any success for themselves because they've been taught they've got to have some giant immediate success or it's not success at all.
[00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:06.330]  Or if they fail, they're afraid to fail.
[00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.892]  They think that's defeat.
[00:38:07.892 --> 00:38:17.698]  I know so many men who failed a couple times at something and then were incredible people who have early success, then have a few failures and then quit and are destroyed individuals.
[00:38:17.698 --> 00:38:20.220]  I think early success is dangerous.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:30.966]  That when you've had slow approxive... successive approximation success, then you realize human potential.
[00:38:30.966 --> 00:38:33.047]  And the globalists realize you have that potential.
[00:38:33.047 --> 00:38:35.088]  They know who you are.
[00:38:35.088 --> 00:38:36.789]  They know who we are.
[00:38:36.789 --> 00:38:43.072]  And they can't be in control unless you are stunted.
[00:38:43.072 --> 00:38:45.453]  And so I'm just going to say this right now.
[00:38:45.453 --> 00:38:50.056]  I want liberty and freedom and the empowerment of every human on this globe.
[00:38:51.957 --> 00:38:57.620]  But they put people into groups who then think they're going to have success by pulling me down, and I got news for you.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.762]  You're not going to pull me down, ever.
[00:39:00.762 --> 00:39:04.184]  I know my destiny, even in death.
[00:39:04.184 --> 00:39:10.248]  I have already accepted victory, and I will quote V for Vendetta, ideas are bulletproof.
[00:39:11.257 --> 00:39:12.337]  They're bulletproof.
[00:39:12.337 --> 00:39:14.798]  You can kill my name, you can kill my body.
[00:39:14.798 --> 00:39:16.939]  I've already transmitted the message.
[00:39:16.939 --> 00:39:19.080]  And I intend to go on transmitting.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.980]  You can't stop the signal.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:27.562]  The signals I've sent out will bounce around as long as there's humans on terra firma and beyond.
[00:39:27.562 --> 00:39:33.764]  And I want to challenge all of you to tune into the universe right now and take your destiny in its hands.
[00:39:33.764 --> 00:39:38.386]  I know you've got chills out there, some of you listening right now, and that's because God is calling.
[00:39:39.591 --> 00:39:47.512]  And God's creation that you are bathed in in the time-space continuum is calling for you to be what you were born to be.
[00:39:48.666 --> 00:39:59.571]  Before God formed you in your mother's womb, you had a destiny and the enemy wants to destroy that destiny and is jealous because the devil is never a maker.
[00:39:59.571 --> 00:40:11.216]  The devil is a counterfeiter and a twister and anyone, any culture that sells out to the devil becomes what you saw in Nazi Germany, Communist China.
[00:40:11.216 --> 00:40:11.717]  Look at
[00:40:13.154 --> 00:40:28.446]  Look at Haiti in a satellite image right next to the Dominican Republic, that island, Hispaniola, split down the middle and look at the difference between a culture that loved God at some level and a culture that loved the devil.
[00:40:28.446 --> 00:40:38.913]  One is deforested and dead, looks like hell, Mordor, and the other is a paradise.
[00:40:38.913 --> 00:40:40.715]  I know the fruits of evil.
[00:40:42.076 --> 00:40:43.878]  And I know they're destructive.
[00:40:43.878 --> 00:40:46.960]  I know the thrill of evil and evil knowledge.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.182]  I know the thrill of the mystery of evil.
[00:40:49.182 --> 00:40:50.663]  The knowledge of good and evil.
[00:40:50.663 --> 00:40:52.124]  I'm fallen.
[00:40:52.124 --> 00:40:52.925]  I'm fallen.
[00:40:52.925 --> 00:40:56.248]  I can look into the paradigm of the devil.
[00:40:56.248 --> 00:40:58.170]  I can see it.
[00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.813]  I can even have my flesh lust for it and know it.
[00:41:04.039 --> 00:41:22.290]  But creation and the power of regeneration that God's given us and the strength is a trillion times a trillion unknowably powerful and more powerful than death and destruction and evil and disease and hate.
[00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:28.914]  The New World Order channels the spirit of dark servants, dark riders.
[00:41:28.914 --> 00:41:30.115]  They are animated
[00:41:31.357 --> 00:41:36.579]  By their lust for the raw exercise of power as the priest of power.
[00:41:36.579 --> 00:41:44.302]  But those that ride the black horses of death and that carry out the work of killing and destroying
[00:41:46.434 --> 00:41:48.516]  Are only wearing a uniform.
[00:41:48.516 --> 00:41:51.318]  They are not individually being empowered.
[00:41:51.318 --> 00:41:59.184]  They are turning themselves over and their free will over to something that is of another dimension.
[00:41:59.184 --> 00:42:02.387]  Something that seeks eternal cold.
[00:42:02.387 --> 00:42:07.291]  Something that seeks the fall.
[00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:09.893]  I seek the rise!
[00:42:12.588 --> 00:42:33.597]  Alright, enough of me philosophizing off into the nether regions of the universe, across the great gulfs of the time-space continuum, echoing throughout.
[00:42:33.597 --> 00:42:36.418]  Stare not too long into the abyss, lest you become the abyss.
[00:42:42.196 --> 00:42:47.158]  And Dianne Feinstein has stared long into the abyss.
[00:42:47.158 --> 00:42:51.360]  Dianne Feinstein, I can look at her, she is possessed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.861]  You can call it whatever you want, that is an entity.
[00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:58.803]  An entity.
[00:42:58.803 --> 00:43:01.504]  An entity.
[00:43:01.504 --> 00:43:02.064]  In the U.S.
[00:43:02.064 --> 00:43:05.366]  Senate.
[00:43:05.366 --> 00:43:10.508]  And they can feel our resolve and that we know who they are and they don't like it.
[00:43:12.486 --> 00:43:26.375]  And the more we consciously realize who the globalists are, the more they writhe in the knowledge that we understand their lie.
[00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:29.958]  Because for them, they've already crossed the void.
[00:43:29.958 --> 00:43:35.221]  The lock refuses the key when the master's calling their name.
[00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:38.584]  They are now slaves.
[00:43:38.584 --> 00:43:40.305]  Slaves to the dark side.
[00:43:41.442 --> 00:43:43.664]  They've already crossed the River Styx.
[00:43:43.664 --> 00:43:47.967]  They've already paid their coins into the hand of Charon.
[00:43:47.967 --> 00:43:50.369]  They're already dead to God.
[00:43:50.369 --> 00:43:52.931]  God did not cast them into hell.
[00:43:52.931 --> 00:44:00.417]  They willingly walked down the stairs.
[00:44:00.417 --> 00:44:09.424]  They willingly threw the key into the chasm to bounce down the edge of the walls forever.
[00:44:11.204 --> 00:44:19.928]  On their journey into the ninth circle of Hades.
[00:44:19.928 --> 00:44:23.269]  On their journey into the void.
[00:44:23.269 --> 00:44:30.072]  On their journey into that place that they dare not look.
[00:44:30.072 --> 00:44:34.094]  Dianne Feinstein, the ghoul.
[00:44:34.094 --> 00:44:35.715]  The animated corpse.
[00:44:40.114 --> 00:44:43.357]  The shark-eyed demon.
[00:44:43.357 --> 00:44:44.758]  They put a photo of her up on TV.
[00:44:44.758 --> 00:44:45.418]  That doesn't catch you.
[00:44:45.418 --> 00:44:47.540]  You've got to see her in high def.
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.881]  Man, I see those eyes.
[00:44:48.881 --> 00:44:49.982]  I've looked into that place.
[00:44:49.982 --> 00:44:52.404]  I mean, I know.
[00:44:52.404 --> 00:44:57.207]  Oh boy, that's a bad one right there.
[00:44:57.207 --> 00:44:59.429]  Michael Moore is another one of them.
[00:44:59.429 --> 00:45:01.551]  He knows he's a fascist.
[00:45:01.551 --> 00:45:03.432]  He knows he's a tyrant.
[00:45:03.432 --> 00:45:06.215]  He knows he's part of an establishment revolution takeover.
[00:45:06.943 --> 00:45:24.073]  He's a big fat, I don't mean physically fat, but spiritually bloated, dominant, weak, mile-long worm who just wants to dominate everybody in his flailing weakness.
[00:45:24.073 --> 00:45:27.495]  Because in his heart, he's so weak, he seeks power.
[00:45:27.495 --> 00:45:31.117]  Dianne Feinstein is another thing entirely.
[00:45:31.117 --> 00:45:33.798]  She's a powerful woman who turned herself over to pure evil.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:40.043]  Makes me literally cringe to see her when she's up there.
[00:45:40.043 --> 00:45:46.727]  Because that's Satan, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:46.727 --> 00:45:52.831]  Most people that have that much evil on them start breaking down like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama or George W. Bush.
[00:45:52.831 --> 00:45:55.012]  Just even get close to it, destroys you.
[00:45:55.012 --> 00:45:56.673]  She revels in it.
[00:45:56.673 --> 00:46:00.135]  She shines like a prism of black light.
[00:46:00.135 --> 00:46:01.256]  A black flash of light.
[00:46:05.555 --> 00:46:12.921]  Yeah, and when I talk about ghouls, when I talk about demonic ghouls, I've seen clips of her going, I've seen the photos, I know details.
[00:46:12.921 --> 00:46:16.804]  And I saw her on the news, we had to find that clip because I saw it online and gave it to you but never played it.
[00:46:16.804 --> 00:46:21.108]  And she kind of just licks her lips and she says, I know details, I have details.
[00:46:22.189 --> 00:46:23.470]  She can't even help it.
[00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:25.171]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:46:25.171 --> 00:46:27.232]  And it's the same thing with Michael Moore.
[00:46:27.232 --> 00:46:30.255]  He's like, yeah, we ought to show the dead kids.
[00:46:30.255 --> 00:46:32.837]  We ought to show the dead kids.
[00:46:32.837 --> 00:46:33.357]  What'd he say?
[00:46:33.357 --> 00:46:35.379]  He goes, what'd he say on his own website?
[00:46:35.379 --> 00:46:37.620]  That's how we finish off the NRA.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:43.405]  That's how we disarm these people while I have six bodyguards all armed while I've got guns.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.682]  We show dead kids, we throw them in their face.
[00:46:46.682 --> 00:46:51.646]  You're going to show us all the dead kids from Fast and Furious with their heads chopped off, shot up in Mexico, thousands of them.
[00:46:51.646 --> 00:46:55.289]  You're going to show all the, you're going to show all that, the little kids dying in the maquiladoras.
[00:46:55.289 --> 00:47:01.794]  You're going to show us, uh, you're going to show us all the, all the dead kids from Obama's drone strikes all over the world.
[00:47:01.794 --> 00:47:10.101]  No, no, you, you, you show foreign mainline newswire photos of dead kids on our, on our nightly news and it goes on YouTube.
[00:47:10.101 --> 00:47:11.202]  They shut our channel down.
[00:47:13.188 --> 00:47:21.433]  And I have to have lawyers write them letters and say it's Selective Enforcement and show them where another news agency has it on one of their foreign servers for them to back off.
[00:47:21.433 --> 00:47:28.617]  To the point that we don't even do it anymore because we can't, because I can't fight all day to keep the transmission going out.
[00:47:28.617 --> 00:47:34.660]  You see, they want to show you, those little kids, their brains, their skulls, their blood, which is like a beautiful thing to them.
[00:47:36.693 --> 00:47:40.174]  And your pain, watching you have your heart touched, it's a joke to them.
[00:47:40.174 --> 00:47:41.994]  Let's show them the dead kids.
[00:47:41.994 --> 00:47:46.635]  That's how we'll get their guns, so they can have their terror upon us.
[00:47:46.635 --> 00:47:49.396]  I said I'd go to your calls and I haven't done that yet, have I?
[00:47:49.396 --> 00:47:53.377]  I'll go to break and take calls in this segment and the next, and a lot of you will get to talk to Larry Pratt.
[00:47:53.377 --> 00:47:55.117]  Most of these are on guns.
[00:47:55.117 --> 00:48:01.479]  Larry, Ghost, Dirk, Shiloh, Robbie, others, I'll get to you.
[00:48:01.479 --> 00:48:05.180]  You know, the families are ripping Michael Moore, wanting to pimp their children out.
[00:48:06.323 --> 00:48:15.448]  You see, to evil the desecration of children and then using children's deaths... I mean, the UN killed over a million people in Rwanda.
[00:48:15.448 --> 00:48:16.689]  They ran that.
[00:48:16.689 --> 00:48:18.310]  Over a million people.
[00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:19.671]  Low estimates are, you know, 500, 600,000.
[00:48:19.671 --> 00:48:22.772]  It's well over a million, actually.
[00:48:22.772 --> 00:48:24.453]  And it's, oh, the UN failed to stop it.
[00:48:24.453 --> 00:48:25.954]  No, the UN ran the whole deal.
[00:48:25.954 --> 00:48:30.417]  After they took the guns, then they had the majority kill the minority, who'd been the majority.
[00:48:31.374 --> 00:48:32.215]  Are they convinced?
[00:48:32.215 --> 00:48:34.779]  Well, you know, turn your guns and we'll be friendly.
[00:48:34.779 --> 00:48:35.760]  One black group against the other.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.843]  Well, they killed the Christians.
[00:48:37.843 --> 00:48:40.426]  Anywhere the UN is, they kill the Christians.
[00:48:40.426 --> 00:48:44.111]  They're using Al-Qaeda to kill the Christians right now in Syria.
[00:48:47.478 --> 00:48:54.220]  And you notice two weeks ago Henry Kissinger came out, let's show people this, just the headline, Israel will not exist in 10 years.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.360]  That's basically a good thing.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.820]  So they're going to double cross Israel.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.881]  So you're like, well, wait, is Israel good or is Israel bad?
[00:48:59.881 --> 00:49:01.102]  It's neither.
[00:49:01.102 --> 00:49:03.942]  It's a set piece for a larger plan.
[00:49:03.942 --> 00:49:05.343]  Albert Pike told us about it in 1877.
[00:49:05.343 --> 00:49:06.743]  Head of the Illuminati.
[00:49:13.137 --> 00:49:14.979]  Head of the Freemasons worldwide?
[00:49:14.979 --> 00:49:17.041]  Freemasons were not in it.
[00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:18.242]  They were being controlled.
[00:49:18.242 --> 00:49:21.745]  You keep your friends close, your enemies closer.
[00:49:21.745 --> 00:49:31.594]  That's what Adam Weishaupt, a few New World Order leaders, a few Darth Sidiouses before him.
[00:49:31.594 --> 00:49:34.657]  You see, once you know history, once you know the enemy, once you know their plans,
[00:49:36.544 --> 00:49:37.624]  It's very clear.
[00:49:37.624 --> 00:49:44.947]  And of course, they're now saying the right-wing whites who are pro-gun are terrorists and are the bigger threat than Al-Qaeda and are going to blow everything up.
[00:49:44.947 --> 00:49:47.387]  And so when things get blown up, who do you think get it?
[00:49:47.387 --> 00:49:48.288]  Who has the motive?
[00:49:48.288 --> 00:49:49.208]  Who told you it was coming?
[00:49:49.208 --> 00:49:55.110]  Boy, if I was a cop and I'd studied criminology, which I have, first thing I'd do, who talked about this first?
[00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:57.351]  You know, a lot of times they catch firefighters.
[00:49:57.351 --> 00:50:04.893]  Firefighters are some of the best people out there, but you'll have nuts that go, who are pyromaniacs, who go become firefighters so they can burn stuff down and then be the heroes that put it out.
[00:50:05.674 --> 00:50:09.236]  We're gonna let firefighters or cops that plant pipe bombs at their houses?
[00:50:09.236 --> 00:50:10.637]  I see that every few months.
[00:50:10.637 --> 00:50:14.759]  And the first thing the cops know, that are real cops, is, okay, it's probably a cop did this.
[00:50:14.759 --> 00:50:17.060]  You did this yourself?
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.721]  And the person usually freaks out and goes, how did you know?
[00:50:18.721 --> 00:50:19.862]  Then they get him.
[00:50:19.862 --> 00:50:23.004]  Because that person didn't read criminology, I guess they didn't do their homework.
[00:50:23.004 --> 00:50:28.387]  I mean, you know, hey, hey, hey, we know who the main people are here.
[00:50:28.387 --> 00:50:30.128]  You know, we know who to look at when this happens.
[00:50:30.128 --> 00:50:31.208]  We know who has the motive.
[00:50:31.208 --> 00:50:32.509]  We know who has the background.
[00:50:32.509 --> 00:50:33.530]  We know who's done it before.
[00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.790]  It's you.
[00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:35.845]  It's a globalist.
[00:50:35.845 --> 00:50:37.026]  They stand to gain.
[00:50:37.026 --> 00:50:38.346]  Motive means everything.
[00:50:38.346 --> 00:50:39.127]  History.
[00:50:39.127 --> 00:50:39.827]  You're it.
[00:50:39.827 --> 00:50:40.627]  You're a terrorist.
[00:50:40.627 --> 00:50:41.007]  We know it.
[00:50:41.007 --> 00:50:41.448]  Globalist.
[00:50:41.448 --> 00:50:41.768]  We know.
[00:50:41.768 --> 00:50:42.848]  You're getting everybody ready.
[00:50:42.848 --> 00:50:45.649]  All the TV shows, how the right-wing gunners are going to blow everything up.
[00:50:45.649 --> 00:50:46.610]  All the cultural stuff.
[00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:47.810]  All the training manuals.
[00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:49.271]  And now the Death Star is clear to fire.
[00:50:49.271 --> 00:50:51.792]  You think we're going to blow yourself up politically.
[00:50:51.792 --> 00:50:54.593]  You think you're going to fire on us and blow stuff up and blame us.
[00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:55.513]  And I hope you don't do it.
[00:50:55.513 --> 00:50:58.595]  But when you do, it isn't going to go the way you thought it will.
[00:50:58.595 --> 00:50:59.155]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.478 --> 00:51:01.879]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.879 --> 00:51:12.550]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.

[00:51:34.505 --> 00:51:40.649]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:51:40.649 --> 00:51:50.536]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:51:50.536 --> 00:51:52.037]  The war is here.
[00:51:52.037 --> 00:51:53.939]  It's an info war.
[00:51:53.939 --> 00:51:55.900]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[00:54:05.262 --> 00:54:08.507]  I don't want no shackles, no shackles on me.
[00:54:08.507 --> 00:54:10.690]  I sit down with Big Brother.
[00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:12.753]  The National ID.
[00:54:12.753 --> 00:54:14.316]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:54:16.274 --> 00:54:18.316]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:18.316 --> 00:54:19.577]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:19.577 --> 00:54:20.918]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:20.918 --> 00:54:22.419]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:22.419 --> 00:54:23.860]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.801]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:24.801 --> 00:54:26.462]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:26.462 --> 00:54:27.603]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:27.603 --> 00:54:28.483]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:44.008 --> 00:54:46.410]  Well, that sounds extreme, Jimmy Vaughn.
[00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:46.530]  Why?
[00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:47.290]  Why not be a slave?
[00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:50.152]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:07.605 --> 00:55:08.785]  We're going to go to your phone calls here.

[00:55:36.063 --> 00:55:37.585]  Let's talk to Larry in Illinois.
[00:55:37.585 --> 00:55:39.447]  Larry, what's on your mind today?
[00:55:39.447 --> 00:55:43.631]  I know I kind of went off on a rampage about the loveliness of Dianne Feinstein.
[00:55:43.631 --> 00:55:43.952]  Go ahead.
[00:55:45.356 --> 00:55:47.558]  That's okay, Alex.
[00:55:47.558 --> 00:55:48.619]  I was calling today.
[00:55:48.619 --> 00:55:57.987]  I've been trying to get a hold of any local media in Illinois around me to talk about this.
[00:55:57.987 --> 00:56:00.530]  I want to start at the beginning of the story.
[00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:11.460]  Late last year, like mid-December, the Supreme Court gave Illinois 180 days to come up with some sort of right-to-carry law.
[00:56:12.728 --> 00:56:15.490]  No, that's happened all over the country, and they just ignore it.
[00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.091]  Absolutely, yeah.
[00:56:17.091 --> 00:56:19.413]  Their answer was to stage Sandy Hook.
[00:56:19.413 --> 00:56:20.314]  And of course they did it.
[00:56:20.314 --> 00:56:20.834]  Go ahead, sorry.
[00:56:20.834 --> 00:56:22.355]  Oh, that's okay.
[00:56:22.355 --> 00:56:24.217]  There's no doubt, by the way, folks.
[00:56:24.217 --> 00:56:26.198]  Sorry.
[00:56:26.198 --> 00:56:28.640]  This bill's being fast-tracked through the Senate.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.984]  You know, usually a Senate bill takes, you know, five, six months before it actually gets anywhere.
[00:56:33.984 --> 00:56:36.506]  But it's only been, you know, two and a half months
[00:56:37.509 --> 00:56:39.109]  And it's already been to a subcommittee.
[00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:41.790]  It's going to go to the House.
[00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:47.812]  Yeah, that's why they're using obvious psychiatric patients under government mind control, doctor's control.
[00:56:47.812 --> 00:56:50.733]  I mean, in Aurora, that's a fact, 100%.
[00:56:50.733 --> 00:56:52.513]  To go out and kill people is to get our guns.
[00:56:52.513 --> 00:56:53.493]  They're desperate.
[00:56:53.493 --> 00:56:54.874]  They know the growth curve.
[00:56:54.874 --> 00:56:55.834]  We're winning.
[00:56:55.834 --> 00:56:57.114]  We are on the march.
[00:56:57.114 --> 00:57:00.535]  But the enemy is involved in a giant counteroffensive.
[00:57:00.535 --> 00:57:02.316]  And yes, I'm aware of that Illinois situation.
[00:57:02.316 --> 00:57:03.716]  So what's your final point on that, sir?
[00:57:05.416 --> 00:57:22.333]  My final point is this act is adding an 18% tax to firearms and ammunition, and it is going to require people who already own guns, who will own guns, to get a $1 million... No, I know, I know, it's bankrupt gun owners.
[00:57:22.333 --> 00:57:25.235]  It's a total... While saying we're not coming for your guns...
[00:57:26.328 --> 00:57:30.913]  I mean, they're passing laws that they do home inspections of all gun owners.
[00:57:30.913 --> 00:57:33.956]  Ammo, you have to get a psychiatric evaluation to buy ammo.
[00:57:33.956 --> 00:57:41.043]  I mean, putting us into the psychiatric system that puts people on the drugs that cause them to do the mass shootings when it's not staged.
[00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:46.624]  Yeah, and they're making, not having this insurance a felony.
[00:57:46.624 --> 00:57:52.189]  And no one I know, anywhere near me, can afford a million dollar liability insurance.
[00:57:52.189 --> 00:57:53.831]  Well, sir, that's how they do it.
[00:57:53.831 --> 00:57:55.853]  Insurance is the ultimate tyranny now.
[00:57:55.853 --> 00:57:59.877]  Sounds good on the surface, but then they make you get health insurance so it doubles in one year.
[00:57:59.877 --> 00:58:04.201]  Well, anything where you're made to get it, and you've got to only buy it from certain people, you're going to be ripped off.
[00:58:05.154 --> 00:58:09.857]  And no, I mean the plan is wreck things while they consolidate it.
[00:58:09.857 --> 00:58:16.402]  This is called a scorched earth political takeover and they want to start a civil war because we're kicking their butt politically.
[00:58:16.402 --> 00:58:18.083]  Everyone hates them now.
[00:58:18.083 --> 00:58:19.644]  Obama doesn't have a mandate.
[00:58:19.644 --> 00:58:24.287]  They had to run a weirdo against him to make it even believable that he won.
[00:58:24.787 --> 00:58:26.108]  Romney really won, by the way.
[00:58:26.108 --> 00:58:27.569]  I've had top voting experts on.
[00:58:27.569 --> 00:58:28.349]  It's clear.
[00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:29.730]  People that said Al Gore really won.
[00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:31.010]  Al Gore really won in 2000.
[00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:33.172]  Mitt Romney really won last year.
[00:58:33.172 --> 00:58:34.552]  God bless you, sir.
[00:58:34.552 --> 00:58:36.093]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[00:58:36.093 --> 00:58:42.877]  We'll talk to Ghost, Dirk, and others.
[00:58:42.877 --> 00:58:46.839]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:59.196]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:58:59.196 --> 00:59:02.877]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:59:02.877 --> 00:59:07.339]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[00:59:53.177 --> 00:59:55.579]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.579 --> 01:00:02.824]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:02.824 --> 01:00:04.124]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.124 --> 01:00:05.906]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:07.647]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:09.228]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.228 --> 01:00:10.789]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:14.972]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.972 --> 01:00:19.035]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.756 --> 01:00:28.865]  Well, we got Larry Pratt coming up in the next segment, and we got state news, federal news on the Second Amendment, really hardcore.
[01:00:28.865 --> 01:00:30.928]  We'll get to that when he joins us.
[01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:36.254]  Michael Moore saying, you know, let's use the dead kid's images to terrorize the public and to turn their guns in via collective guilt.
[01:00:37.596 --> 01:00:38.656]  Just total mind control.
[01:00:38.656 --> 01:00:53.439]  We cannot let this demonic Jabba the Hutt creature manipulate us and use dead kids as a terrorist, a psych terrorist, psychological terrorism, to submit to him and his bodyguards and all their weaponry so he can create socialism to steal our wealth and give it to himself in government bailouts.
[01:00:53.439 --> 01:00:55.959]  The families are just outraged by these slovenly demons.
[01:00:55.959 --> 01:00:59.380]  So the globalists will have to probably stage some more shootings if they just love him.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.580]  Dirk in Arizona, you're on the air, Dirk.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.281]  Welcome.
[01:01:03.281 --> 01:01:04.761]  Hey, Crybaby.
[01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:05.301]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:10.312]  The other day I heard you say you don't know what to do anymore.
[01:01:10.312 --> 01:01:16.414]  Well, I saw one of your contest videos on YouTube called Alex Jones for Governor.
[01:01:16.414 --> 01:01:19.936]  Can you type it into YouTube or Google right now?
[01:01:19.936 --> 01:01:21.416]  Sure, Alex Jones for Governor.
[01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:22.977]  What's it say?
[01:01:22.977 --> 01:01:24.718]  Yeah, it just does four words.
[01:01:24.718 --> 01:01:28.259]  I think it's number one or number two.
[01:01:28.259 --> 01:01:29.920]  Did you find it yet?
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.400]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.821]  You're on the air.
[01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.161]  Yeah, Alex Jones for Governor.
[01:01:33.161 --> 01:01:33.902]  Just type it in.
[01:01:33.902 --> 01:01:34.362]  Did you get it?
[01:01:38.663 --> 01:01:41.605]  Go ahead and make your point, okay?
[01:01:41.605 --> 01:01:45.527]  Anyway, I disagree with your decision not to run for governor.
[01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:48.649]  You were talking about that with Savage last week.
[01:01:48.649 --> 01:01:51.771]  And I agree with the guy on the video.
[01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:54.293]  He's wearing a Jason mask from Friday to Thursday.
[01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:56.154]  Yeah, let's punch him up.
[01:01:56.154 --> 01:01:58.376]  OperationPaulRevereInfoWars.com contact.
[01:01:58.376 --> 01:01:59.516]  I like a redneck Jason.
[01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:00.417]  That's cool.
[01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:01.037]  That's right.
[01:02:01.037 --> 01:02:02.138]  Operation Paul Revere.
[01:02:04.167 --> 01:02:12.270]  Now, on that video, he talks about your son, and he says he's got seven good solutions.
[01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:18.912]  For example, as governor, you'll be able to throw out PSA from the airports.
[01:02:18.912 --> 01:02:25.335]  Number two, as governor, you'll be able to stop the chemtrail planes.
[01:02:25.335 --> 01:02:26.795]  I didn't hang up on you, sir.
[01:02:26.795 --> 01:02:27.435]  Somebody's calling you.
[01:02:27.435 --> 01:02:28.596]  You want to flip over and say hi to them?
[01:02:29.801 --> 01:02:31.301]  No, that's okay.
[01:02:31.301 --> 01:02:32.202]  I'll let you go.
[01:02:32.202 --> 01:02:34.482]  But I just want to know, did you find the video yet?
[01:02:34.482 --> 01:02:35.042]  Yes, I did.
[01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:36.483]  I just said I found it.
[01:02:36.483 --> 01:02:38.623]  Look, I hear you, and God bless you, sir.
[01:02:38.623 --> 01:02:45.765]  I am affecting more change on the radio, and I've always been honest about my past, which is, I'm proud of my past.
[01:02:45.765 --> 01:02:48.185]  I mean, I've lived a pretty exciting, interesting life.
[01:02:48.185 --> 01:02:53.327]  But I mean, some of what I've said is true, and then some, and then some, and then some.
[01:02:53.327 --> 01:02:58.148]  So, I mean, they would really use all that against me, which would be a great publicity stunt.
[01:02:59.588 --> 01:03:01.611]  I'm not just interested in a publicity stunt.
[01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:06.076]  If I ever ran for office, Mike Hanson one time talked me into running for state rep.
[01:03:06.076 --> 01:03:08.118]  And for about a week I was signed up.
[01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:13.865]  And when I read all of it and had to go to these fundraisers, I never really ran.
[01:03:13.865 --> 01:03:15.527]  And they spin it, Alex Jones lost.
[01:03:15.527 --> 01:03:15.988]  No I didn't.
[01:03:15.988 --> 01:03:16.989]  I pulled out of the race.
[01:03:16.989 --> 01:03:18.471]  I was signed up for like a week.
[01:03:19.904 --> 01:03:28.887]  I was having to go report to the Texas Elections Commission and I looked at it and read the contracts where they could selectively throw me in jail for any reason.
[01:03:28.887 --> 01:03:31.808]  And I just didn't do it.
[01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.309]  I'd like to see Ron Paul run for Texas Governor.
[01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:37.590]  I know there's a move to get him drafted to do that.
[01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:42.171]  And I'd like to see Rand Paul as President.
[01:03:42.171 --> 01:03:43.172]  He's a great statesman.
[01:03:44.761 --> 01:03:47.922]  He's not a perfect person, but compared to everybody else, I know he's a real guy.
[01:03:47.922 --> 01:03:49.343]  It's like Jesse Ventura.
[01:03:49.343 --> 01:03:52.124]  I don't agree with some of Jesse Ventura's views.
[01:03:52.124 --> 01:03:56.986]  He thinks some of the tyranny stuff is really, you know, liberal.
[01:03:56.986 --> 01:04:02.029]  But he's a real guy, and that's what I value, is someone who doesn't compromise.
[01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:07.731]  I've gotten to spend a lot of time with Jesse Ventura on the road, video shoots, also as a consultant, you know, to the show.
[01:04:07.731 --> 01:04:08.692]  He's as real as it gets.
[01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:15.211]  That's what I like.
[01:04:15.211 --> 01:04:17.373]  That's what I'm into.
[01:04:17.373 --> 01:04:18.474]  It's real.
[01:04:18.474 --> 01:04:19.434]  I want reality.
[01:04:19.434 --> 01:04:22.257]  I want the real deal.
[01:04:22.257 --> 01:04:24.018]  And I just love Ron Paul a lot.
[01:04:24.018 --> 01:04:30.783]  I mean, I've seen a lot of people that have even been on this show attack Ron Paul and play the race card stuff for no reason, like MSNBC.
[01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:36.067]  And that's because the entire left is circling the wagons around Obama because he is a horrible tyrant.
[01:04:36.067 --> 01:04:38.369]  They think it will discredit their giant government system.
[01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:42.454]  And they all live off the government one way or another.
[01:04:42.454 --> 01:04:44.036]  And so they believe in it.
[01:04:44.036 --> 01:04:48.281]  And so they're just coldly going with the divide and conquer orthodoxy.
[01:04:48.281 --> 01:04:54.589]  And I've seen a circling of the wagons of Marxists, Leninists, liberals, they're useful idiot morons, all of them.
[01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:57.132]  We've got to circle the wagons as libertarian constitutionalists.
[01:04:58.567 --> 01:05:01.970]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:08.014]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:05:08.014 --> 01:05:11.897]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:08:09.357 --> 01:08:10.899]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:10.899 --> 01:08:15.104]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.104 --> 01:08:19.169]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.141 --> 01:08:30.805]  It is the Ides of March, Friday the 15th day, 2013.
[01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:32.907]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.907 --> 01:08:36.149]  We are back now into the second hour.
[01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:43.215]  We're getting Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America lined up to be on with us with a big gun update right now.
[01:08:43.215 --> 01:08:51.022]  And I wanted to direct TV viewers but also radio listeners to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:51.022 --> 01:08:54.685]  First victim entrapped in New York under unconstitutional gun law.
[01:08:55.322 --> 01:09:18.578]  You know, they've been arresting veterans, running checkpoints, they've got a list of gun owners, and if they find over a seven-round mag, they charge you with felonies, and they are now doing stings where they're going to gun shows and places, and a lot of people don't even know that above ten-round mags or seven-round mags are outlawed from possession, and they're throwing the book at you.
[01:09:19.708 --> 01:09:22.690]  And Project Veritas has gone into New York police stations and things.
[01:09:22.690 --> 01:09:25.411]  They just say, look, you shouldn't have any guns, get a dog.
[01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:27.853]  Just like Michael Moore has said.
[01:09:27.853 --> 01:09:41.000]  And speaking of the self-propelled goblin, self-propelled stomach, Sandy Hook families ripped Michael Moore's call to release crime scene photos.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.424]  And so the issue here is that Michael Moore
[01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:48.581]  Has bodyguards.
[01:09:48.581 --> 01:09:50.646]  I've run into them.
[01:09:50.646 --> 01:09:52.711]  On the city street, hey Michael, why are you in the Second Amendment?
[01:09:52.711 --> 01:09:54.014]  Bam, boom, you know, running into me.
[01:09:54.014 --> 01:09:55.398]  It's in my film, Martial Law.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.442]  They've been arrested for having guns in illegal areas.
[01:09:58.442 --> 01:10:00.524]  He has guns, but you aren't.
[01:10:00.524 --> 01:10:03.126]  And they're always like, oh, it's just reasonable restrictions.
[01:10:03.126 --> 01:10:10.792]  Wherever they're in control, like Chicago, New York, or other areas, they ban all of the guns.
[01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:11.273]  Okay?
[01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:17.018]  And the UN, in their own treaties, have said they want total abolition of civilian firearms ownership.
[01:10:17.018 --> 01:10:24.424]  So, let's just get that straight here for absolutely everybody out there.
[01:10:27.739 --> 01:10:35.225]  That they are coming for our guns, and that that's what Dianne Feinstein said.
[01:10:35.225 --> 01:10:36.586]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them in.
[01:10:36.586 --> 01:10:39.788]  Remember Obama said, I'm not coming after your handgun, your rifle, your shotgun, anything.
[01:10:39.788 --> 01:10:41.449]  Anybody says it's a liar.
[01:10:41.449 --> 01:10:45.833]  And I'm also not going to raise anybody's payroll tax by under a quarter million dollars a year.
[01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:48.415]  Not your payroll tax, not your... He raised them all.
[01:10:49.617 --> 01:10:52.819]  And people are like, well, that's just what they do.
[01:10:52.819 --> 01:10:56.000]  I guess we've just rolled over then to this type of criminality.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.381]  Well, the answer is no, we've not rolled over.
[01:10:58.381 --> 01:11:10.888]  And now the Sandy Hook families are getting really, really, really, really upset over the fact that they are engaged in these type of activities.
[01:11:12.045 --> 01:11:13.146]  Now, here's another one.
[01:11:13.146 --> 01:11:19.430]  InfoWars is reporting Feinstein's doomed bill, that's what Kirk calls it, squeaks by Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:21.271]  I don't think it's doomed.
[01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:23.272]  I mean, I see confidence in their eyes.
[01:11:23.272 --> 01:11:29.836]  She said a few weeks ago, she said there will be other incidents.
[01:11:29.836 --> 01:11:33.899]  More things are going to happen.
[01:11:33.899 --> 01:11:36.381]  This is going to go on.
[01:11:36.381 --> 01:11:38.122]  This is going to unfold.
[01:11:41.787 --> 01:11:49.770]  And they have set things up now, as Obama said, and it's their talking point, not one more child can be killed.
[01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:54.972]  What about the kids killed by the Mexican cartels with American guns, shipped in by the White House and are fast and furious?
[01:11:54.972 --> 01:11:57.853]  Does Michael Moore want to see the dead bodies of those children out there?
[01:11:57.853 --> 01:12:02.854]  To quote, what'd he say, finish off the NRA, which they mean by the Second Amendment.
[01:12:02.854 --> 01:12:09.757]  They never like to say the Second Amendment, it's always the NRA, as if that's all there is with guns, because the NRA helped write the 68 Gun Control Act,
[01:12:10.177 --> 01:12:11.659]  They supported a bunch of other gun control.
[01:12:11.659 --> 01:12:13.341]  They've gotten a little more hardcore.
[01:12:13.341 --> 01:12:17.305]  We've had Ted Nugent on because he's on the board, and he's made them get more hardcore.
[01:12:17.305 --> 01:12:23.953]  But mainly because Larry Pratt and Gunners of America, for what is it, 40 years or so, has been there making them be hardcore.
[01:12:23.953 --> 01:12:27.096]  And we are joined now by Larry Pratt.
[01:12:27.797 --> 01:12:37.700]  Executive Director of Gun Owners of America to give us a State of the Second Amendment in this culture war and they admit that's what it is now.
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:44.462]  The system is calling it a culture war where in the states the collectivists, the authoritarians are in control.
[01:12:44.462 --> 01:12:49.844]  I mean they are arming tanks, machine guns, weapons, more police, checkpoints for gun owners.
[01:12:50.524 --> 01:12:54.966]  And in the areas where there's liberty, all the jobs are flooding, prosperity.
[01:12:54.966 --> 01:12:58.948]  I mean, these people are terminally corrupt.
[01:12:58.948 --> 01:13:05.051]  Larry Pratt, Executive Director, GunOwners.org, the only no-compromise major gun lobby on Capitol Hill.
[01:13:05.051 --> 01:13:06.732]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[01:13:06.732 --> 01:13:07.892]  Alex, great to be with you.
[01:13:07.892 --> 01:13:09.133]  Thanks so much for having me.
[01:13:09.133 --> 01:13:09.613]  You bet.
[01:13:09.613 --> 01:13:15.336]  Okay, in the time we've got, what is front and center right now on the Second Amendment radar screen?
[01:13:15.336 --> 01:13:17.277]  The deadly gun bills getting out of committee.
[01:13:18.729 --> 01:13:26.911]  It got out of committee, but Alex, we still think that that's not their first point of attack.
[01:13:26.911 --> 01:13:44.515]  What we're concerned about, the way the legislative structure has been put together right now on the gun fight, if you will, is there's going to be a motion to proceed on, it doesn't really matter much, one of these gun bills.
[01:13:45.274 --> 01:13:54.178]  Any motion to proceed will open up the parliamentary situation for adding other gun bills.
[01:13:54.178 --> 01:14:13.648]  So even if they say, well, you know, we don't really have the votes for this or that, if they put it out on the floor and they get that vote, they very well might get it to go through, especially if there's something that looks relatively innocuous at the beginning.
[01:14:14.228 --> 01:14:24.453]  And then they peg on some of these other measures to it, they could end up getting a lot more of their agenda than, frankly, right now.
[01:14:24.453 --> 01:14:28.615]  I don't think they can, but they can slip one through if we're not careful.
[01:14:28.615 --> 01:14:34.939]  So if people are going to communicate with their members of the Senate, please, anything that has gun in it.
[01:14:36.187 --> 01:14:38.248]  Any bill that has gun in it.
[01:14:38.248 --> 01:14:44.830]  The request from the constituents is vote no on any motion to proceed.
[01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:51.332]  What about your idea from six months before the election that he would get back in maybe and then if they did they were going for all the guns.
[01:14:51.332 --> 01:14:55.934]  We now have the memos confirming that they want to just ban them basically all.
[01:14:55.934 --> 01:14:57.714]  I mean that's huge.
[01:14:57.714 --> 01:15:01.616]  What about getting on the offense like you said Congressman Stockman from Texas.
[01:15:01.616 --> 01:15:04.517]  I mean we've got to get on the offense to get them on the defense.
[01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:08.706]  That is so true.
[01:15:08.706 --> 01:15:12.289]  So defensively, vote against any motion to proceed.
[01:15:12.289 --> 01:15:19.256]  That opens the candy store and they can pick and choose as to which gun control they think they can get away with before the voters.
[01:15:19.256 --> 01:15:22.459]  But the way to even better head them off is to get
[01:15:23.221 --> 01:15:31.909]  More members of the House to sign on to Representative Stockland's bill that would take away the prohibition on guns at school.
[01:15:31.909 --> 01:15:39.776]  So finally, a teacher that's qualified for a concealed carry permit, a principal, a janitor,
[01:15:40.575 --> 01:15:53.809]  A visiting parent would be able to respond with a firearm or somebody to come into one of these murder magnets, which is what our gun-free zones have become for the last 20 years.
[01:15:53.809 --> 01:15:54.589]  Murder magnets.
[01:15:54.589 --> 01:15:55.470]  Murder magnets.
[01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.911]  Great term.
[01:15:56.471 --> 01:16:00.074]  Well, unhappily, that's what they are.
[01:16:00.074 --> 01:16:05.978]  All of our mass murders over the last 20 years have been at a gun-free zone.
[01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:09.020]  And the media advertises it for all the lunatics to go into.
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:09.540]  What about this?
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:14.864]  You pointed out if they'd stage Fast and Furious, they'd wind up a lunatic and you'd at least let them do it.
[01:16:14.864 --> 01:16:15.945]  Clearly with the Holmes thing.
[01:16:16.465 --> 01:16:24.753]  Under psychiatric care, getting a DARPA grant in weird brain interface stuff, on seven drugs, we now learned four of them, psychotropic.
[01:16:24.753 --> 01:16:32.100]  She had this manual where he was reportedly planning it, there was a stand down by the top Air Force psychiatrist assigned to him.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.762]  I mean, this really stinks.
[01:16:33.762 --> 01:16:37.846]  If they'd staged that, shouldn't we look at things, Larry, in the future?
[01:16:37.846 --> 01:16:40.649]  You know, that if they'd staged something else, they'd staged this.
[01:16:41.621 --> 01:16:52.148]  Yeah, if they want a date of mine, maybe they ought to look for kids that have Facebook pages for Satan, because the Newtown shooter had just such a page.
[01:16:52.148 --> 01:16:58.492]  So did Herrick and Kleibel were into Satanism and Nazism.
[01:16:58.492 --> 01:16:59.112]  Exactly.
[01:16:59.112 --> 01:17:08.118]  The guy that, and I hate to use their names, but the guy that shot up Congresswoman Giffords' town hall and liked to kill her.
[01:17:08.858 --> 01:17:12.321]  Also had an altar to the occult out in his backyard.
[01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:16.405]  A skull, devil worship, and the guy that killed his grandmother with the hammer.
[01:17:16.405 --> 01:17:22.371]  And then when his mother died, got the illegal AR-15 and shot the fireman.
[01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:24.493]  He was a known devil worshiper on record.
[01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:33.800]  So maybe we ought to put devil worshippers into some sort of protective custody.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:39.888]  They're talking so much about having a psychiatrist say, well, you might be a danger to yourself or others.
[01:17:40.829 --> 01:17:43.070]  Maybe we've seen a pattern here.
[01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:50.494]  You play video games for hours on end so you become completely disconnected from social contact.
[01:17:50.494 --> 01:17:52.995]  You become desensitized to murder.
[01:17:52.995 --> 01:17:54.735]  It becomes fun.
[01:17:54.735 --> 01:18:00.098]  Then you also get in a little time with Satan during the day.
[01:18:00.879 --> 01:18:03.504]  And we wonder why these things happen.
[01:18:03.504 --> 01:18:07.311]  It has nothing to do with whether a gun is available or not.
[01:18:07.311 --> 01:18:09.735]  These guys become thoroughly evil.
[01:18:09.735 --> 01:18:12.921]  They're going to get the means of mass destruction no matter what we do.
[01:18:14.804 --> 01:18:17.906]  Absolutely, and that's why we have a right to protect ourselves.
[01:18:17.906 --> 01:18:24.950]  But what about the collective guilt thing with Michael Moore saying, really with relish, let's show the dead kids.
[01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.831]  I mean, what a vulture demon.
[01:18:26.831 --> 01:18:29.492]  I've never hated him before.
[01:18:29.492 --> 01:18:32.674]  I've disliked him, but I really hate him.
[01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:36.196]  And also, Feinstein's been smacking her lips talking about the photos.
[01:18:36.196 --> 01:18:37.177]  I mean, just what a demon.
[01:18:37.728 --> 01:18:43.435]  Didn't Feinstein get a wonderful comeuppance from Senator Cruz?
[01:18:43.435 --> 01:18:44.856]  Oh my.
[01:18:44.856 --> 01:18:56.710]  Well, Senator Feinstein, if the Second Amendment permits the banning of certain guns, then by that logic, does the First Amendment permit the banning of certain books?
[01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:59.052]  She said, how dare you lecture me?
[01:18:59.052 --> 01:19:00.233]  I've been here for 20 years.
[01:19:00.233 --> 01:19:02.034]  Well, that's the problem, witch.
[01:19:20.218 --> 01:19:25.301]  No, I tell you, I mean Ted Cruz at least has worked in the private sector and done a lot of other stuff and is a libertarian.
[01:19:25.301 --> 01:19:29.605]  I mean, this woman, being on Capitol Hill for decades, have you ever been around her?
[01:19:29.605 --> 01:19:32.006]  I mean, just looking at her makes me cringe.
[01:19:32.006 --> 01:19:41.473]  It's somebody that's very full of herself, as her own words were suggesting, that there's nothing you can teach me, little boy.
[01:19:41.473 --> 01:19:44.636]  What do you think, I am a sixth grader or something?
[01:19:44.636 --> 01:19:46.197]  No ma'am, I'm not here to insult sixth graders.
[01:19:47.059 --> 01:19:51.051]  Well, to quote Emperor Palpatine, it's like, I am the Senate, Cruz.
[01:19:51.051 --> 01:19:52.897]  Sit down and shut up.
[01:19:52.897 --> 01:19:53.860]  I am the Emperor.
[01:19:54.352 --> 01:19:55.393]  Larry Pratt's our guest.
[01:19:55.393 --> 01:19:55.833]  Stay with us.
[01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:58.715]  Larry will be right back with more updates on the Second Amendment.
[01:19:58.715 --> 01:20:02.098]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:20:02.098 --> 01:20:08.122]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:20:08.122 --> 01:20:11.985]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:20:11.985 --> 01:20:13.566]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[01:21:01.796 --> 01:21:06.482]  In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public.
[01:21:06.482 --> 01:21:09.345]  And we're still selling them almost 30 years later.

[01:21:48.927 --> 01:21:50.188]  Emergency preparedness.
[01:21:50.188 --> 01:21:51.289]  Emergency relief.
[01:21:51.289 --> 01:21:54.070]  Longlifefood.com since 1983.
[01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:55.971]  Sending real food to your real future.
[01:21:57.429 --> 01:22:04.092]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:04.092 --> 01:22:12.215]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:12.215 --> 01:22:20.039]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:20.379 --> 01:22:25.463]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:25.463 --> 01:22:30.687]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:30.687 --> 01:22:35.031]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:35.031 --> 01:22:36.112]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:36.112 --> 01:22:40.636]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:40.636 --> 01:22:45.540]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:48.062]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:22:48.522 --> 01:22:53.845]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.845 --> 01:22:56.486]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:56.486 --> 01:22:58.767]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:22:58.767 --> 01:22:59.707]  Answer this.
[01:22:59.707 --> 01:23:11.993]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?
[01:23:13.234 --> 01:23:15.395]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:23:15.395 --> 01:23:17.516]  This year about one in every 50 U.S.
[01:23:17.516 --> 01:23:21.617]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target.
[01:23:21.617 --> 01:23:24.198]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:23:24.198 --> 01:23:32.241]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:35.202]  It's like a lamp on a timer but far more convincing.
[01:23:35.202 --> 01:23:35.663]  And for only $34.95,
[01:23:36.983 --> 01:23:42.268]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[01:23:42.268 --> 01:23:44.850]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:45.911]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com.
[01:23:45.911 --> 01:23:47.853]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:24:03.302 --> 01:24:11.890]  When Larry Pratt leaves us here in about 15 minutes, we're going to air excerpts from Infowars Nightly News last night with Senator Ted Cruz.
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:17.702]  The Ron Paul revolution is what he's part of right here in Texas.
[01:24:17.702 --> 01:24:22.464]  That's what's got the establishment Republicans so scared up there getting in her face.
[01:24:22.464 --> 01:24:25.265]  And her answer was belligerence and arrogance just like Hillary Clinton.
[01:24:25.265 --> 01:24:28.426]  But I want to get into some of the victories we're having but also the biggest threats.
[01:24:28.426 --> 01:24:34.569]  But Kurt Nemo wrote for Infowars.com last week a article
[01:24:35.953 --> 01:24:42.157]  Basically saying Democrats, Republicans, and NRA, you know, work behind the scenes on gun control measures.
[01:24:42.157 --> 01:24:51.582]  And the NRA said, we're in there working with them, and seeing the NRA in the past being pro-gun control, and most people don't know this, so can you speak to that?
[01:24:51.582 --> 01:24:59.347]  Not bashing the NRA, they've gotten better, but what is the danger with compromise from the Republicans and the NRA, Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America?
[01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:14.523]  Well, if the Republicans go for a compromise, which would be the instinct of all too many of them, and certainly John Boehner has that, I guess, deeply embedded in his DNA, then you open, as
[01:25:15.724 --> 01:25:33.215]  Our legislative strategist Mike Hammond has put it, a guy with enormous experience up on particularly the Senate side of the Capitol, you open up the gun control buffet, because once they get anything on the floor, then it's Katy Barr the door.
[01:25:34.239 --> 01:25:52.435]  And so what we're telling Senators and what we want anybody else that wants to try to shut this thing down is call the Senate, let your Senators know, vote no on any motion to proceed on anything that has the word G-U-N in it.
[01:25:52.435 --> 01:25:59.922]  Doesn't matter if it's a John Wayne celebratory resolution, it's just not something that
[01:26:00.402 --> 01:26:00.823]  We're good.
[01:26:13.732 --> 01:26:31.097]  Motion to proceed, or because they're just afraid to vote and put it out, because they know we're watching and we're going to try to take some of them down, Republican and Democrat, in the next primaries and election, then I think we may be able to dodge the bullet.
[01:26:32.218 --> 01:26:42.867]  So, I think their main, minimum objective at the moment is the so-called trafficking bill, which would be particularly vicious.
[01:26:42.867 --> 01:26:54.518]  It would say that if a gun is raffled, say, by an American Legion post, and it's raffled in a state, well, I'm pretty sure I'm right about Oregon being a pro-pot state.
[01:26:54.518 --> 01:26:57.701]  You can smoke pot under Oregon state law, legally.
[01:26:58.365 --> 01:27:02.648]  But under federal law, that still disqualifies you from buying a gun.
[01:27:02.648 --> 01:27:08.753]  So, the raffle is held, and the guy that wins takes his gun.
[01:27:08.753 --> 01:27:20.741]  Raffles typically are not done with a background check, but it turns out that the guy that got the gun is a prohibited person under federal law, even though he was allowed to pick his gun up while poking on a... puffing on a toque.
[01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:24.514]  Wow.
[01:27:24.514 --> 01:27:27.944]  This is a real gotcha piece of legislation.
[01:27:27.944 --> 01:27:29.610]  Very, very dangerous.
[01:27:30.485 --> 01:27:31.706]  Well, it's the registration.
[01:27:31.706 --> 01:27:33.347]  Let me bring this up to you, then.
[01:27:33.347 --> 01:27:36.328]  What do you make of... I think the way we beat them is getting the word out.
[01:27:36.328 --> 01:27:41.431]  Everywhere they're in control, they're now arresting veterans for over seven round mags, they're doing stings on people.
[01:27:41.431 --> 01:27:44.813]  They want to fill the prisons with gun owners.
[01:27:44.813 --> 01:27:46.814]  And they want to start a confrontation.
[01:27:46.814 --> 01:27:51.336]  Where do you see this going right now as a battlefield analysis?
[01:27:51.336 --> 01:27:52.557]  How's the fight going?
[01:27:52.557 --> 01:27:55.818]  Because, yeah, they're politically getting in trouble, but they don't care.
[01:27:55.818 --> 01:27:58.540]  Their instinct to dominate us is moving forward.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:19.214]  Yeah, the veteran they picked on is in New York State, but now I think the people, the legislators of New York State realized that maybe they shouldn't have let Cuomo, Buffalo them if you will, and run that bill banning guns and magazines so fast because there is a growing
[01:28:19.793 --> 01:28:42.676]  Building anger, and even people in New York State are talking about, they've talked to their state police in their county, and they've told them, you better not try to do anything for Cuomo's legislation, because that's illegitimate, we're not going to stand for it anymore, and you will start it if you try to come and take somebody's guns.
[01:28:43.997 --> 01:28:51.522]  That's right, well that's my concern, but it may be the only way it goes, is that you see that 1776 collision coming.
[01:28:51.522 --> 01:28:57.786]  A lot of people who weren't ready for confrontation really are committed now, and that's not bluff, that's real.
[01:28:57.786 --> 01:28:58.286]  Right.
[01:28:58.286 --> 01:29:06.291]  And I just hope... There's a change in attitude, and by the way, the rank and file of those state cops said that they were in agreement.
[01:29:06.291 --> 01:29:10.534]  It was only the union-type hierarchy in the
[01:29:10.854 --> 01:29:20.783]  Yeah, have you suddenly seen the videos by New York State Police out doing their own shooting videos in uniform and others showing that you can shoot off 30 rounds just as fast with 10 round mags or 7 round mags?
[01:29:20.783 --> 01:29:22.084]  Have you seen those videos?
[01:29:22.084 --> 01:29:24.806]  Yes, and it's a great instructional.
[01:29:24.806 --> 01:29:33.674]  So even if you're limited legally in New York State, with minimum practice, you can be pretty good with a 7 or 10 round mag.
[01:29:34.611 --> 01:29:41.899]  I want to get an update on the Supreme Court, what's happening in Illinois, the states, and some other key points with Larry Pratt of GunOwners.org.
[01:29:41.899 --> 01:29:42.740]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:46.324]  Stay with us in the Ted Cruz video, your phone calls, and a lot more.
[01:29:58.607 --> 01:30:07.151]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:30:07.151 --> 01:30:10.832]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:30:10.832 --> 01:30:15.294]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:30:15.294 --> 01:30:19.996]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[01:30:58.402 --> 01:31:05.625]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:31:05.625 --> 01:31:23.494]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:31:23.494 --> 01:31:27.616]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:31:27.896 --> 01:31:29.657]  And discovered Young-Jevity.

[01:32:55.154 --> 01:33:06.959]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.031 --> 01:33:30.351]  I think?
[01:33:37.037 --> 01:33:39.158]  Alright, I was just telling Larry Pratt about the L.A.
[01:33:39.158 --> 01:33:39.458]  Times.
[01:33:39.458 --> 01:33:40.538]  We just sent him a link to it.
[01:33:40.538 --> 01:33:41.698]  He's reading it.
[01:33:41.698 --> 01:33:46.599]  There's also an Infowars.com report on it, but it's Patriot Peril is the headline.
[01:33:46.599 --> 01:33:49.900]  If you guys punch up my screen, I can show TV viewers right here.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:50.200]  L.A.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.961]  Times announces white men are the terrorists, and the Examiner got it right.
[01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:54.822]  It said L.A.
[01:33:54.822 --> 01:33:59.163]  Times says white men are a greater threat than al-Qaeda.
[01:34:01.203 --> 01:34:06.745]  So, really, really amazing, amazing info to see that.
[01:34:06.745 --> 01:34:08.145]  And they say there's a new terrorist.
[01:34:08.145 --> 01:34:10.666]  They're Christian religious people.
[01:34:10.666 --> 01:34:11.607]  And they're white.
[01:34:11.607 --> 01:34:12.607]  And they believe in guns.
[01:34:12.607 --> 01:34:14.467]  And they believe we're coming for their guns.
[01:34:14.467 --> 01:34:15.708]  And they're belligerent.
[01:34:15.708 --> 01:34:19.069]  So we need FBI task forces to come after them.
[01:34:19.069 --> 01:34:21.210]  Here's the Southern Poverty Law Center report.
[01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:22.970]  And it's Larry Pratt and Alex Jones.
[01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:28.012]  I mean, they've really crossed the Rubicon on where you say, I don't want Socialist Healthcare.
[01:34:28.012 --> 01:34:28.372]  Racist.
[01:34:29.173 --> 01:34:30.035]  I don't want gun control.
[01:34:30.035 --> 01:34:30.918]  You're racist.
[01:34:30.918 --> 01:34:32.903]  What's your argument that's racist?
[01:34:32.903 --> 01:34:33.785]  Racist!
[01:34:33.785 --> 01:34:35.108]  Larry Pratt, what do you make of that?
[01:34:36.534 --> 01:34:41.657]  They are, I think, at a point where they're really getting kind of desperate.
[01:34:41.657 --> 01:34:50.061]  They were hoping that with Obama in for a term where he doesn't have to face re-election, that it was going to be Katie Barr the door.
[01:34:50.061 --> 01:35:01.307]  And I think that explains why the media feeding frenzy following Newtown has far outlasted the feeding frenzy that followed Columbine.
[01:35:02.268 --> 01:35:14.401]  But Columbine was only four years after the Democrats lost control of the House because of their support for Feinstein's gun ban.
[01:35:14.401 --> 01:35:21.589]  Well, now she's back, and the issue is heating up again, and apparently they think somehow they're going to be more politically able to
[01:35:22.552 --> 01:35:23.673]  Take the heat.
[01:35:23.673 --> 01:35:24.433]  I don't think so.
[01:35:24.433 --> 01:35:29.996]  I think they're hurting themselves every day that they keep this debate going.
[01:35:29.996 --> 01:35:39.041]  It's another day that more Americans understand that, gee, these people really want control over about everything, don't they?
[01:35:39.041 --> 01:35:40.501]  Well, you betcha.
[01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:42.262]  Now you've got the message.
[01:35:42.262 --> 01:35:43.783]  It's not just about guns.
[01:35:43.783 --> 01:35:47.385]  It's about everything that free people do and want to do.
[01:35:48.085 --> 01:36:04.313]  And Janet Napolitano has got to be really happy, because she's the one that started out this, at least from the Obama administration, saying that it's people that are constitutionalists, pro-lifers, pro-Second Amendment, veterans.
[01:36:04.313 --> 01:36:08.254]  These are the potential terrorists that police need to be watching out for.
[01:36:08.254 --> 01:36:13.457]  No wonder jihadists are able to blow so many places up, because it's like
[01:36:15.802 --> 01:36:28.915]  Well, the LA Times actually says at the end of the article, Patriot Peril, it says it's time to shift from Al Qaeda and shift to the right wing and it really is like a bunch of Che Guevara revolutionaries.
[01:36:28.915 --> 01:36:33.199]  You know, they write all these weird articles about how they're going to arrest us and all the stuff they're going to do.
[01:36:33.199 --> 01:36:35.742]  I mean, it's really creepy.
[01:36:35.742 --> 01:36:39.606]  It is creepy, but I think they haven't checked with the average cop.
[01:36:40.446 --> 01:37:00.187]  Who is maybe not as enthusiastic about defining a terrorist that way because he's got a he's out on the street the average cop is and He would like to have the working environment as he can and I think most cops maybe not up in the hierarchy where they're sort of
[01:37:01.568 --> 01:37:04.649]  Bowing and cow-towing to the politicians.
[01:37:04.649 --> 01:37:10.751]  But the average cop wants to come home at night and he knows that there is an element of danger in his job.
[01:37:10.751 --> 01:37:11.071]  Sure.
[01:37:11.071 --> 01:37:13.172]  And his job isn't going to be made any easier.
[01:37:13.172 --> 01:37:15.412]  Well, they know high gun areas have less crime.
[01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:18.973]  All the local and FBI statistics, it's like 49% lower.
[01:37:18.973 --> 01:37:21.634]  And the areas where they took all the guns are bloodbaths for everybody.
[01:37:21.634 --> 01:37:23.975]  Larry, what about the good news on the offense front?
[01:37:24.755 --> 01:37:26.576]  Well, states are fighting back.
[01:37:26.576 --> 01:37:40.263]  Not only are sheriffs, and I think you and I have talked about that, and the number grows of the sheriffs that we've identified that are telling the feds, don't try that in my county, it's not constitutional, and I'll arrest you if you do.
[01:37:40.263 --> 01:37:52.930]  But states are now considering legislation that would tell the feds, we'll make it state law that we'll put you in jail if you come into our state and try to enforce unconstitutional gun laws.
[01:37:53.610 --> 01:38:08.267]  In some cases, I think they've also broadened it so that if the feds try to arrest somebody for the kind of fertilizer he puts on his farm or, you know, a number of other areas where the feds have completely gone beyond the limits of the government.
[01:38:08.267 --> 01:38:13.173]  They're talking about jail time in rulemaking, as you know, last year for hay dust.
[01:38:14.258 --> 01:38:32.563]  Well, the jail time that needs to be talked about is a minimum 366 days on a penalty for violating a state law, say a gun law, which say permits you to do something that the Feds don't like in the Second Amendment area.
[01:38:32.563 --> 01:38:36.064]  If they get convicted in that state of an offense,
[01:38:47.993 --> 01:38:55.099]  Oh, what about the gun manufacturers moving en masse to not sell to government agencies that are anti-gun?
[01:38:55.099 --> 01:38:58.722]  I mean, I think it's time to absolutely defeat these people.
[01:38:58.722 --> 01:39:05.888]  Long term, they're going to bring in the giant hordes of illegal aliens, indoctrinate them in socialism, in anti-gun liberty, and it's game over.
[01:39:06.368 --> 01:39:08.870]  Now they're going to hunt us down, and then there'll be a giant civil war.
[01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:11.191]  These people are crazy.
[01:39:11.191 --> 01:39:15.794]  They're very highly motivated because they want to control everything.
[01:39:15.794 --> 01:39:22.839]  They're convinced that, like socialists are, that they know best, and that we just need to shut up and do what we're told.
[01:39:22.839 --> 01:39:26.382]  And that's why they tried to control political speech.
[01:39:26.382 --> 01:39:31.005]  John McCain and then others after him have tried to
[01:39:32.326 --> 01:39:40.112]  Keep us from speaking as much as we could, politically limiting how much money we'd be able to raise and spend and so forth.
[01:39:40.112 --> 01:39:42.854]  These people don't want to have an argument.
[01:39:42.854 --> 01:39:45.536]  They just want you and me to shut up.
[01:39:45.536 --> 01:39:54.382]  They'd love nothing better than to take your show off the air and our email off the internet, which people can get if they go to GunOwners.org.
[01:39:54.382 --> 01:39:59.626]  It's just a never-ending battle, and it's certainly not just about guns.
[01:40:00.916 --> 01:40:03.218]  Larry Pratt, I know you've got to go here in a few minutes.
[01:40:03.218 --> 01:40:05.701]  We were talking during the break.
[01:40:05.701 --> 01:40:10.826]  Any other tidbits of legislative news people need to know, and then we're going to roll some video for TV viewers.
[01:40:10.826 --> 01:40:17.974]  For radio listeners, we'll give out the name at the end of the video when you're talking about it of the video online.
[01:40:17.974 --> 01:40:18.694]  What is that headline?
[01:40:18.694 --> 01:40:20.696]  I think it's something like Joe Biden by a shotgun.
[01:40:20.696 --> 01:40:21.617]  I think that's all it's called.
[01:40:25.356 --> 01:40:30.100]  Yeah, and the other video with millions of views is Two Funny Women Take Joe Biden's Advice.
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.341]  That's the name of the video.
[01:40:31.341 --> 01:40:35.404]  I'll have Kurt Nemo repost it in the tiles at Infowars.com right now.
[01:40:35.404 --> 01:40:40.668]  It's got millions and millions of views, and it shows women who don't know how to shoot guns, obviously, firing 12 gauges.
[01:40:40.668 --> 01:40:49.435]  And I'll tell you, I've got 12 gauges when you're shooting double-aught buck or slugs that have a bigger kick than single shot without springs like Barrett's.
[01:40:49.435 --> 01:40:52.097]  I've got a Barrett, too, that have more kick.
[01:40:52.677 --> 01:40:56.701]  Okay, I mean, I got a little bit of short 410 Snake Charmer that has a bigger kick than a 50.
[01:40:56.701 --> 01:40:58.722]  It's just the way it works.
[01:40:58.722 --> 01:41:05.668]  And so you've got these women shooting high-powered 12-gauge shotguns, blowing them back, and then Biden's saying, get a shotgun, just don't have an AR-15.
[01:41:05.668 --> 01:41:11.273]  Well, an AR-15, folks, is perfect for women because there's almost no recoil.
[01:41:11.273 --> 01:41:16.758]  My 8-year-old daughter shoots bullseye now at about 100 yards with an AR-15.
[01:41:16.758 --> 01:41:19.060]  Well, it's an M4 Bushmaster.
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:32.543]  The video that I think you and I both are thinking about not only shows the women getting blown back on their backsides, but it also shows a lady who's firing an AR-15, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:41:32.543 --> 01:41:38.685]  She hardly flinches, and she just keeps going to the next target, the next target, the next target.
[01:41:38.685 --> 01:41:41.385]  In contrast, you don't need any lecture.
[01:41:41.385 --> 01:41:48.947]  You just have to look and see what happens to the women following Biden's advice, or the women that follow somebody who knows something about guns.
[01:41:50.427 --> 01:41:53.289]  What do you make of him saying, walk out and fire it in the air?
[01:41:53.289 --> 01:41:55.691]  In most cities, that's a reckless discharge.
[01:41:55.691 --> 01:41:56.612]  You're going to go to jail.
[01:41:56.612 --> 01:41:59.735]  I mean, he's giving people felony advice.
[01:41:59.735 --> 01:42:02.977]  Somebody already did that and he has been charged.
[01:42:02.977 --> 01:42:06.580]  And the problem is what goes up has to come down.
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:08.682]  And so if you're just firing
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:19.583]  To follow Uncle Joe's advice, you may put a load of buckshot right in the pool party somewhere down the block.
[01:42:19.583 --> 01:42:24.564]  And his advice also, subsequently, was followed up by an even better idea.
[01:42:24.564 --> 01:42:26.224]  Well, just fire through the door!
[01:42:26.224 --> 01:42:29.765]  Well, you really know what's on the other side of the door?
[01:42:29.765 --> 01:42:31.245]  Is that a really good idea?
[01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:36.667]  And meanwhile, if you fire both of those barrels, if you manage to fire both without
[01:42:38.287 --> 01:42:45.329]  Blowing out of your hand, Mrs. America, you're unarmed now.
[01:42:45.329 --> 01:42:54.672]  All you have is about a five-pound stick, and you'd have to reload, and that's going to take a little bit of time.
[01:42:54.672 --> 01:43:06.116]  So Uncle Joe would put you in even graver danger, assuming the gun's still in your hands after you fired it, and you haven't committed a local offense by doing it the way he suggested.
[01:43:06.996 --> 01:43:17.384]  Clearly, you know, when he had that shotgun in his hand, in that picture that may have started this whole thing off, he's holding it and he's leaning slightly back.
[01:43:17.384 --> 01:43:25.149]  I'll guarantee you that if he did end up firing that gun after the picture was taken, which I doubt, he would have been just like the ladies.
[01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:26.430]  He would have been back on his keister.
[01:43:27.355 --> 01:43:28.816]  Well, I mean, it's totally ridiculous.
[01:43:28.816 --> 01:43:30.096]  It's so easy with a shotgun.
[01:43:30.096 --> 01:43:31.556]  All you do is jam it into your shoulder.
[01:43:31.556 --> 01:43:32.937]  And it depends on the shotgun.
[01:43:32.937 --> 01:43:38.979]  But, I mean, movies show this giant kick, like Police Academy or something.
[01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:40.339]  That's really not how most guns are.
[01:43:40.339 --> 01:43:47.262]  But, yes, particularly a sawed-off shotgun has one of the worst recoils, but also the barrel rising.
[01:43:47.802 --> 01:43:53.264]  I carry a legally sought off Russian bounty hunter, just a copy of an American gun.
[01:43:53.264 --> 01:44:01.207]  When I'm in my truck, because I know if somebody ever really does try to mug me or attack me, even though I'm proficient with handguns, Glocks, .40s, you name it.
[01:44:06.141 --> 01:44:07.882]  Colt 911s, all of them.
[01:44:07.882 --> 01:44:14.965]  The problem is under stress, even though I've been shooting guns since I was four years old, I may hesitate a bit or have a problem.
[01:44:14.965 --> 01:44:20.387]  That's why I like a double-barreled shotgun, because I can instantly jam it off safety with my thumb.
[01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:21.788]  It's got two triggers.
[01:44:21.788 --> 01:44:23.529]  There's absolutely no thinking about it.
[01:44:23.529 --> 01:44:29.391]  And I've got birdshot, like number eight, so I will not kill people 20 yards behind the person.
[01:44:29.391 --> 01:44:32.513]  But yeah, Biden didn't say have birdshot or something.
[01:44:32.513 --> 01:44:34.854]  He said, and women are gonna probably go by,
[01:44:35.154 --> 01:44:38.317]  They might buy slugs and kill somebody half a mile away.
[01:44:38.317 --> 01:44:41.580]  I mean, it is just the worst advice ever.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:46.884]  Yep, the Vice President, the Armorer-in-Chief.
[01:44:46.884 --> 01:44:53.490]  We are just so fortunate to have such a talented individual and so well informed, too.
[01:44:53.490 --> 01:44:58.014]  The guy, well, it's too serious to make a joke out of it.
[01:44:58.294 --> 01:44:59.195]  It is.
[01:44:59.195 --> 01:45:03.399]  In closing, Larry Pratt, thank you for coming on at least once a month to give us updates.
[01:45:03.399 --> 01:45:04.660]  GunOwners.org.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:07.143]  People can go there, sign up for the free email alerts.
[01:45:07.143 --> 01:45:08.824]  Critical, critical, critical.
[01:45:08.824 --> 01:45:13.168]  And just sleep better at night knowing you've got your watchdogs up there on Capitol Hill, and we salute you.
[01:45:13.168 --> 01:45:17.973]  And people can also go to the site and become members, and if they don't, they're just not fighting back.
[01:45:17.973 --> 01:45:20.015]  The bare minimum, you can do, folks.
[01:45:20.015 --> 01:45:21.476]  And people making videos.
[01:45:21.476 --> 01:45:22.337]  Our culture,
[01:45:22.657 --> 01:45:25.259]  We're only getting in the culture war for liberty now.
[01:45:25.259 --> 01:45:26.419]  That's why we're turning the tide.
[01:45:26.419 --> 01:45:29.781]  So I think the enemy pushing has awakened the sleeping giant.
[01:45:29.781 --> 01:45:31.763]  What do you say, Paul Revere?
[01:45:31.763 --> 01:45:35.565]  I think you are dead spot on.
[01:45:35.565 --> 01:45:44.450]  I think the longer they continue this phony debate over Newtown, the more people are understanding that, yeah, this is a battle for freedom.
[01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:47.212]  Let's not discriminate against folks who have decided to be off the grid.
[01:45:47.212 --> 01:45:48.733]  Give the number of people to call and join.
[01:45:50.111 --> 01:45:56.455]  All right.
[01:45:56.455 --> 01:45:57.656]  Larry, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:45:57.656 --> 01:45:58.637]  God bless, sir.
[01:45:58.637 --> 01:45:59.397]  I look forward to it.
[01:45:59.397 --> 01:45:59.717]  Thank you.
[01:45:59.717 --> 01:46:00.578]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:46:00.578 --> 01:46:00.938]  You bet.
[01:46:00.938 --> 01:46:01.939]  There goes Larry Pratt.
[01:46:01.939 --> 01:46:04.341]  We would have had our guns taken if it wasn't for that group.
[01:46:08.325 --> 01:46:08.806]  Goosebumps.
[01:46:08.806 --> 01:46:10.549]  I mean, that's a rock star right there.
[01:46:10.549 --> 01:46:14.495]  Okay, let's go to this David Knight report he put together for Aaron Dykes.
[01:46:14.495 --> 01:46:20.765]  It was Jakari Jackson last night, did the news portion on what happened with Cruise and the witch, Dianne Feinstein.
[01:46:20.765 --> 01:46:23.008]  Did you hear she's starring in the new Wizard of Oz movie?
[01:46:23.889 --> 01:46:24.890]  I mean, I saw an ad for it.
[01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:26.391]  That's Dianne Feinstein.
[01:46:26.391 --> 01:46:27.212]  So here she is.
[01:46:27.212 --> 01:46:29.594]  She has an instinct to dominate you and your family.
[01:46:29.594 --> 01:46:32.597]  She's going to have armed guards and her billion bucks or whatever with her husband.
[01:46:32.597 --> 01:46:35.039]  You're going to have your guns taken to be gang raped.
[01:46:35.039 --> 01:46:47.189]  So here is the witch king of Angor, Dianne Feinstein, throwing, you know, well, here's Linda Blair puking split pea soup at Ted Cruz.
[01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:49.691]  Here it is.
[01:46:49.691 --> 01:46:51.253]  One, I'm not a sixth grader.
[01:46:52.029 --> 01:46:54.690]  Senator, I've been on this committee for 20 years.
[01:46:54.690 --> 01:46:58.992]  There was a rare discussion on the Constitution and individual rights today in the Senate.
[01:46:58.992 --> 01:47:02.934]  Senator Cruz brought it up with Senator Feinstein, and she was not amused.
[01:47:02.934 --> 01:47:11.618]  There's some 100 pages of the bill that specify particular firearms that if this bill were passed, Congress would have deemed prohibited.
[01:47:11.618 --> 01:47:17.881]  The Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[01:47:17.881 --> 01:47:19.302]  The term, the right of the people,
[01:47:20.353 --> 01:47:24.214]  When the framers included it in the Bill of Rights, they used it as a term of art.
[01:47:24.214 --> 01:47:31.496]  That same phrase, the right of the people, is found in the First Amendment, the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances.
[01:47:31.496 --> 01:47:37.738]  It's also found in the Fourth Amendment, the right of the people to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
[01:47:37.738 --> 01:47:49.902]  And the question that I would pose to the senior senator from California is, would she deem it consistent with the Bill of Rights for Congress to engage in the same endeavor that we are contemplating doing
[01:47:50.569 --> 01:48:08.058]  With the Second Amendment, in the context of the First or Fourth Amendment, namely, would she consider it constitutional for Congress to specify that the First Amendment shall apply only to the following books, and shall not apply to the books that Congress has deemed outside the protection of the Bill of Rights?
[01:48:08.058 --> 01:48:12.880]  Likewise, would she think that the Fourth Amendment's protection against searches and seizures
[01:48:13.795 --> 01:48:23.364]  Could properly apply only to the following specified individuals, and not to the individuals that Congress has deemed outside the protection of the Bill of Rights.
[01:48:26.087 --> 01:48:29.010]  Senator, I've been on this committee for 20 years.
[01:48:29.010 --> 01:48:31.091]  I was a mayor for nine years.
[01:48:31.091 --> 01:48:33.273]  I walked in, I saw people shot.
[01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:36.716]  I've looked at bodies that have been shot with these weapons.
[01:48:36.716 --> 01:48:39.399]  I've seen the bullets that implode.
[01:48:39.399 --> 01:48:42.121]  In Sandy Hook, youngsters were dismembered.
[01:48:48.414 --> 01:48:51.217]  It's fine you want to lecture me on the Constitution.
[01:48:51.217 --> 01:48:52.237]  I appreciate it.
[01:48:52.237 --> 01:48:54.940]  Just know I've been here for a long time.
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:57.101]  I've passed on a number of bills.
[01:48:57.101 --> 01:48:59.523]  I've studied the Constitution myself.
[01:48:59.523 --> 01:49:01.405]  I'm reasonably well educated.
[01:49:01.405 --> 01:49:01.885]  You're a demon!
[01:49:01.885 --> 01:49:03.647]  And I thank you for the lecture.
[01:49:03.647 --> 01:49:10.412]  Incidentally, this does not prohibit, you use the word prohibit, it exempts 2,271 weapons.
[01:49:14.395 --> 01:49:17.897]  Isn't that enough for the people of the United States?
[01:49:17.897 --> 01:49:22.319]  You see how she changed a fundamental right to a government-granted privilege?
[01:49:22.319 --> 01:49:25.661]  You have a God-given right to own any weapon.
[01:49:25.661 --> 01:49:28.942]  That right is recognized by the supreme law of the land.
[01:49:28.942 --> 01:49:33.525]  But Feinstein graciously allows you to have only weapons she lists.
[01:49:33.525 --> 01:49:37.767]  The analogy that Cruz had but didn't press would be that all books would be prohibited
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:40.961]  The answer is obvious.
[01:49:40.961 --> 01:49:41.001]  No.
[01:50:03.186 --> 01:50:05.707]  So, Feinstein says she wouldn't censor books.
[01:50:05.707 --> 01:50:06.807]  Only guns.
[01:50:06.807 --> 01:50:09.768]  There are congresses in the business of making law.
[01:50:09.768 --> 01:50:12.228]  The Supreme Court interprets the law.
[01:50:12.228 --> 01:50:21.191]  The senator knows, having attended law school and professes to have some experience in the Constitution, none of these rights are absolute.
[01:50:21.191 --> 01:50:21.651]  There you go.
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:32.933]  The God-given rights of we the people, we who created the government and delegated carefully prescribed powers to it, we no longer have absolute rights.
[01:50:32.933 --> 01:50:37.780]  Congress and politically appointed judges will tell us what we're allowed to own.
[01:50:40.475 --> 01:50:41.036]  That's right.
[01:50:41.036 --> 01:50:50.189]  And they give themselves absolute rights, though, above the Constitution to incite or trade, commit crimes, exempt themselves from gun laws.
[01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:51.871]  They are enemies.
[01:50:51.871 --> 01:50:53.173]  They work for the New World Order.
[01:50:53.173 --> 01:50:55.016]  They are the Occupation Army.
[01:50:55.016 --> 01:50:56.718]  And if you don't admit that, we have no hope.
[01:50:58.809 --> 01:51:02.594]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[01:51:02.594 --> 01:51:05.859]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:08.662]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[01:51:08.662 --> 01:51:10.805]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[01:51:10.805 --> 01:51:13.629]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[01:51:58.081 --> 01:52:02.844]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:02.844 --> 01:52:04.945]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:05.855 --> 01:52:14.820]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:19.743]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:20.376 --> 01:52:31.744]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:52:31.744 --> 01:52:38.749]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:52:39.429 --> 01:52:43.732]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[01:52:43.732 --> 01:52:47.315]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:52:47.315 --> 01:52:50.257]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[01:52:50.257 --> 01:52:54.580]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:55.861]  Protect your immune system.
[01:52:55.861 --> 01:52:56.882]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:52:57.901 --> 01:53:00.283]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[01:53:00.283 --> 01:53:03.827]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[01:53:03.827 --> 01:53:07.791]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes.
[01:53:07.791 --> 01:53:13.696]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[01:53:13.696 --> 01:53:16.219]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[01:53:16.579 --> 01:53:24.122]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[01:53:24.122 --> 01:53:30.005]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[01:53:30.005 --> 01:53:36.127]  EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[01:53:36.127 --> 01:53:41.570]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs, and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[01:53:42.150 --> 01:53:43.751]  Visit EasyArmor.net.
[01:53:43.751 --> 01:53:46.933]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net.
[01:53:46.933 --> 01:53:47.654]  Or call 888-58-ARMOR.
[01:53:47.654 --> 01:53:48.314]  That's 888-582-7667.
[01:53:48.314 --> 01:53:49.015]  EasyArmor.net.
[01:53:49.015 --> 01:53:50.456]  Ultimate door security made easy.
[01:54:24.586 --> 01:54:27.028]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:27.028 --> 01:54:31.791]  Take a few phone calls in this segment, the next, and Joel Skousen is going to be joining us via video Skype.
[01:54:31.791 --> 01:54:35.534]  Beginning in North Korea, saying, nuke America, kill, kill, kill.
[01:54:35.534 --> 01:54:38.356]  I've never heard such an escalation, and...
[01:54:40.196 --> 01:54:44.821]  We're going to see what Joel's take is on that and the gun grabbing that's going on and everything else.
[01:54:44.821 --> 01:54:48.064]  You know, Joel thinks we've got 5-10 years until they drop the hammer.
[01:54:48.064 --> 01:54:51.607]  And things do tend to move slow because that's how the globalists win.
[01:54:51.607 --> 01:54:53.850]  And I'm seeing things really move quicker and quicker.
[01:54:53.850 --> 01:54:57.813]  So we'll have a discussion about that and continue with your phone calls.
[01:54:57.813 --> 01:55:00.036]  Don't forget to support the broadcast.
[01:55:00.036 --> 01:55:02.738]  I know I'd forget to plug to support the broadcast.
[01:55:02.738 --> 01:55:03.719]  Support our sponsors.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:25.957]  On the radio, on the local radio affiliates you listen to, spread the word about the broadcast, get a PrisonPlanet.tv nightly news, a subscription to watch the nightly news that I and my reporters work on, and also the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the products, clicking on the banners, supporting the online sponsors, that's what funds this operation.
[01:55:27.077 --> 01:55:33.303]  And the best films, books, you name it, are all available at infowarestore.com.
[01:55:33.303 --> 01:55:41.330]  You can also call and ask any questions about ProPure Water Filtration, discounted with promo code WATER, and so much more by simply calling 888-253-3139.
[01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.390]  888-253-3139.
[01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:42.851]  Robbie, in New York, thanks for holding.
[01:55:42.851 --> 01:55:43.652]  You're on the air.
[01:55:52.626 --> 01:55:54.247]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:55.868]  Well, it's a crazy world, isn't it?
[01:55:55.868 --> 01:55:58.430]  Larry Pratt gave us some bad news and some good news.
[01:55:58.430 --> 01:56:02.853]  The bottom line is we're in a fight for our entire Bill of Rights right now.
[01:56:02.853 --> 01:56:04.134]  Oh yes, sir.
[01:56:04.134 --> 01:56:05.475]  A little bit of good news here.
[01:56:05.475 --> 01:56:16.682]  The 52 out of 62 New York counties have introduced resolutions to repeal the New York State Act, and thank God my county Oneida is one of them.
[01:56:18.024 --> 01:56:24.746]  Uh, five of the ones that didn't were in New York City, and the other five were just, I think, maybe more southern counties.
[01:56:24.746 --> 01:56:35.690]  But, uh, I, uh, I, if they could introduce something like this, I really just don't want to live in this state anymore.
[01:56:35.690 --> 01:56:39.851]  I mean, who's to say they won't do it again in the future, even if we can get it repealed?
[01:56:40.748 --> 01:56:44.191]  You know, it's just, they've crossed the line with me.
[01:56:44.191 --> 01:56:45.472]  I don't own guns yet.
[01:56:45.472 --> 01:56:49.995]  I haven't had the money, but you know, I'd like the opportunity to.
[01:56:49.995 --> 01:56:57.601]  And it's just kind of ridiculous for people who were, you know, in the market, so to speak.
[01:56:57.601 --> 01:56:59.243]  And all the sheriffs are standing up too.
[01:56:59.243 --> 01:57:00.944]  That's a great sign.
[01:57:00.944 --> 01:57:02.105]  Well, I mean, it's like 500 now plus.
[01:57:05.086 --> 01:57:05.947]  The Feds don't care.
[01:57:05.947 --> 01:57:09.210]  They're going to run stings, they're going to harass, they're going to demonize.
[01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:11.191]  Again, I've played the clips.
[01:57:11.191 --> 01:57:14.074]  Dianne Feinstein going, we're going to get this done.
[01:57:14.074 --> 01:57:15.295]  If not now, later.
[01:57:15.295 --> 01:57:16.936]  There will be more incidents.
[01:57:16.936 --> 01:57:18.497]  And she smiles.
[01:57:18.497 --> 01:57:22.161]  I mean, this little demonic smirk, little tongue flicks out.
[01:57:22.161 --> 01:57:23.942]  I'll play it later in the next hour.
[01:57:23.942 --> 01:57:24.763]  I mean, they know.
[01:57:24.763 --> 01:57:28.546]  They've set it up where every time a child dies from a gun, it's your fault.
[01:57:28.546 --> 01:57:29.347]  It's collectivism.
[01:57:30.598 --> 01:57:38.730]  And every time somebody beats up a homosexual, it's everyone who's heterosexual's fault.
[01:57:40.242 --> 01:57:44.626]  Or every time a white guy beats up a black guy, it's racism.
[01:57:44.626 --> 01:57:47.529]  But if a black guy beats up a white guy, it's not reported.
[01:57:47.529 --> 01:57:52.753]  It's just all about identity politics, so that we can't get down to individual liberties.
[01:57:52.753 --> 01:57:56.136]  Because when we all have rights, and it's all about what does that person stand for?
[01:57:56.136 --> 01:57:57.057]  What do they produce?
[01:57:57.057 --> 01:57:58.018]  What do they do?
[01:57:58.018 --> 01:57:59.519]  What are their ideas?
[01:57:59.519 --> 01:58:01.481]  Then that's a great culture.
[01:58:01.481 --> 01:58:05.485]  Where the people that have the real talent excel.
[01:58:05.485 --> 01:58:06.666]  And that's people from all groups.
[01:58:08.513 --> 01:58:14.695]  They want a mafia system where they control people through their racial and religious leaders.
[01:58:14.695 --> 01:58:16.315]  It's tribalism.
[01:58:16.315 --> 01:58:20.517]  And I want my tribe to be the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence.
[01:58:20.517 --> 01:58:22.437]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:58:22.437 --> 01:58:26.999]  And I know it's inspired by God, and I know America's special and has a destiny.
[01:58:26.999 --> 01:58:33.261]  But America has been taken over for a long time, over a hundred years, and been used as an engine of evil.
[01:58:33.261 --> 01:58:35.061]  And that's how evil has always worked.
[01:58:35.061 --> 01:58:36.862]  Next hour, your calls, coming up.
[01:58:38.795 --> 01:58:42.276]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.276 --> 01:58:48.338]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.338 --> 01:58:51.359]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:58:51.359 --> 01:58:56.381]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:56.381 --> 01:59:03.543]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:59:03.683 --> 01:59:09.308]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:59:09.308 --> 01:59:13.352]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:59:13.352 --> 01:59:18.077]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:59:18.077 --> 01:59:23.302]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:59:23.542 --> 01:59:26.763]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:59:26.763 --> 01:59:29.264]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:59:29.264 --> 01:59:34.025]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:59:34.025 --> 01:59:36.926]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:59:36.926 --> 01:59:44.128]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:59:44.128 --> 01:59:45.388]  We're getting prepared.
[01:59:45.388 --> 01:59:46.048]  Are you?
[01:59:46.048 --> 01:59:46.849]  Infowarshop.com
[01:59:51.252 --> 01:59:53.633]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:53.633 --> 02:00:00.838]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.838 --> 02:00:02.159]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.159 --> 02:00:03.920]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:05.681]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:05.681 --> 02:00:07.262]  You want answers?
[02:00:07.262 --> 02:00:08.823]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:08.823 --> 02:00:13.005]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.005 --> 02:00:17.068]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.370 --> 02:00:21.891]  We're taking more of your phone calls now.
[02:00:21.891 --> 02:00:24.492]  We'll get some more of your phone calls with Joel Skousen coming up.
[02:00:24.492 --> 02:00:26.772]  I want to get into the race-based politics, too.
[02:00:26.772 --> 02:00:32.074]  He talked about that in the film presentation we did, the strategic relocation.
[02:00:32.074 --> 02:00:33.435]  He talks about it in his book as well.
[02:00:33.435 --> 02:00:34.975]  We sell both at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:00:34.975 --> 02:00:36.756]  Of course, I produce the film.
[02:00:36.756 --> 02:00:38.357]  Of course, we sell it.
[02:00:38.357 --> 02:00:41.918]  But he got into how they're going to do that more and more as a tool of control.
[02:00:42.895 --> 02:00:50.659]  But I first want to get into North Korea and the rest of that with Joel Skousen coming up in the next segment and how he thinks we can turn things around in this country.
[02:00:50.659 --> 02:00:53.921]  But let's talk to Shiloh in Ohio.
[02:00:53.921 --> 02:00:55.042]  You're on the air, Shiloh.
[02:00:55.042 --> 02:00:56.582]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:56.582 --> 02:00:56.782]  Hello.
[02:00:56.782 --> 02:00:58.143]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:00:58.143 --> 02:00:58.723]  I'm doing all right.
[02:00:58.723 --> 02:01:02.405]  It's always good to be on the radio.
[02:01:02.405 --> 02:01:09.749]  Well, I live in a small town in Ohio and I was arrested
[02:01:11.559 --> 02:01:17.003]  What's a statement from somebody?
[02:01:17.003 --> 02:01:19.004]  It was pretty messed up.
[02:01:19.004 --> 02:01:20.625]  It was in front of my kids and everything.
[02:01:20.625 --> 02:01:23.247]  They didn't have a warrant and
[02:01:24.161 --> 02:01:33.986]  The thing is, after everything was said and done, I had to sit my kids down and tell them, you know, not all police are bad.
[02:01:33.986 --> 02:01:37.969]  There are some good people out there that are in law enforcement.
[02:01:37.969 --> 02:01:43.892]  But more and more it is getting twisted and authoritarian, there's no doubt of that.
[02:01:43.892 --> 02:01:47.494]  Did the cops sign a false statement about you, or did somebody else say you did something?
[02:01:48.135 --> 02:01:50.076]  No, this was a citizen.
[02:01:50.076 --> 02:01:56.918]  Well, I mean, what are they going to do if somebody files a false affidavit that you, what, they said you threatened to kill them?
[02:01:56.918 --> 02:02:02.840]  No, my son dinged their car and it just got out of hand.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:06.462]  Yeah, well, a lot of people do that.
[02:02:06.462 --> 02:02:09.223]  What, so the lady then said that you threatened her?
[02:02:09.223 --> 02:02:09.843]  Why'd they arrest you?
[02:02:10.248 --> 02:02:11.068]  No, no, no.
[02:02:11.068 --> 02:02:16.270]  They said it was a hit-and-run and stuff like that, but it really wasn't a hit-and-run.
[02:02:16.270 --> 02:02:17.110]  Well, see, here's the deal.
[02:02:17.110 --> 02:02:22.552]  A guy in Florida released some heart balloons for his girlfriend, and they're charging him with a felony.
[02:02:22.552 --> 02:02:23.872]  They have environmental laws in Europe.
[02:02:23.872 --> 02:02:24.872]  They're now coming in here.
[02:02:24.872 --> 02:02:29.434]  They're trying to get them federally, where I saw in Australia a guy got like five years in jail.
[02:02:30.034 --> 02:02:34.696]  Because a small battery fell out of the cordless phone in the backyard and a neighbor reported it.
[02:02:34.696 --> 02:02:35.516]  It's the Green Police.
[02:02:35.516 --> 02:02:38.037]  You've seen those Audi commercials a few years ago.
[02:02:38.037 --> 02:02:41.058]  They show people being arrested for having the wrong light bulbs.
[02:02:41.058 --> 02:02:42.798]  And then I said, that's real.
[02:02:42.798 --> 02:02:46.559]  That's a conditioning show that they're putting on the Super Bowl and everywhere.
[02:02:46.559 --> 02:02:57.123]  And then later, the producers came out like six months later in the San Francisco Chronicle and said, we were hired to do this to get people ready and admitted it was conditioning.
[02:02:57.123 --> 02:02:57.523]  You know, see,
[02:02:58.323 --> 02:03:00.565]  See, Joel Skousen's always talked about underground bases.
[02:03:00.565 --> 02:03:01.186]  I've talked about it.
[02:03:01.186 --> 02:03:02.507]  They call it a conspiracy theory.
[02:03:02.507 --> 02:03:05.570]  Now they've announced the big giant underground bases and more to be built.
[02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:07.912]  I mean, I don't need to be told about them.
[02:03:07.912 --> 02:03:12.496]  My grandfather lived in Austin, worked with people in business.
[02:03:12.496 --> 02:03:15.078]  One of his good friends was a construction person.
[02:03:15.078 --> 02:03:16.279]  We also had family out there.
[02:03:16.279 --> 02:03:17.380]  I've double confirmed it.
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:22.144]  There are underground tunnels under Bergstrom, the former SAC command base, one of the biggest in the country.
[02:03:23.065 --> 02:03:28.528]  From under the Hilton, all the way out to Fort Hood under some mountains where they store nuclear weapons.
[02:03:28.528 --> 02:03:31.189]  I mean, that's classified, but they're there.
[02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:32.409]  And here it is in the news, U.S.
[02:03:32.409 --> 02:03:35.311]  Air Force plans to build a huge network of underground tunnels.
[02:03:35.311 --> 02:03:45.615]  But look, finishing up here with your call, what are you trying to get at here, that the system lied about you and now you went to jail?
[02:03:45.615 --> 02:03:49.857]  And so you force a jury trial, you put her on the stand, you go all the way, you don't plea bargain.
[02:03:50.848 --> 02:03:55.011]  That's right, you gotta stand up for your rights, because if you don't stand up, nobody else will.
[02:03:55.011 --> 02:03:57.093]  So what's happened with the case?
[02:03:57.093 --> 02:04:07.181]  Well, I still have to go to court and everything, but there's another situation that I wanted to talk about too, which is the gun rights and stuff like that with the police.
[02:04:07.181 --> 02:04:09.563]  They're passing out felonies like they're candy.
[02:04:09.563 --> 02:04:17.750]  I mean, it's just absurd how they make these laws to where if he steals
[02:04:18.491 --> 02:04:26.259]  They're making everything a felony.
[02:04:26.259 --> 02:04:37.051]  Look, they have the three biggest prison companies now in multiple states, New Mexico and others, running the school security and training the kids for prison induction.
[02:04:37.051 --> 02:04:38.954]  This is the giant re-education camp.
[02:04:39.494 --> 02:04:49.378]  Get you in the criminal justice system, injustice system, get you in the government system, get you on welfare, get you on the psychiatric system, or give you deadly vaccines and get you in the medical system.
[02:04:49.378 --> 02:04:54.940]  This is a scientific, anthropogenic, global takeover using binary weapons.
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:55.380]  We'll be right back.

[02:08:04.057 --> 02:08:06.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:12.972 --> 02:08:18.254]  All right, for the balance of the hour on this Friday edition, Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief.
[02:08:18.254 --> 02:08:19.915]  He's the editor over there.
[02:08:19.915 --> 02:08:25.858]  He was, of course, a Marine Corps aviator on aircraft carriers during Vietnam.
[02:08:25.858 --> 02:08:35.302]  And his uncle was one of the first to iconically really expose how the mega bankers actually fund communism as a tool of consolidation and control.
[02:08:35.302 --> 02:08:42.145]  Cleon Skousen, who Glenn Beck credits with waking him up about five years ago, three years ago, when Beck started getting a little bit better.
[02:08:42.985 --> 02:08:44.905]  So that's good.
[02:08:44.905 --> 02:08:49.346]  And he also, of course, has written the book, Strategic Relocation.
[02:08:49.346 --> 02:08:50.407]  The new edition is out.
[02:08:50.407 --> 02:08:52.407]  We sell it at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:52.407 --> 02:08:56.408]  And I made a documentary presentation, it's close to three hours, with Joel Skousen.
[02:08:56.408 --> 02:08:57.748]  It's very well done.
[02:08:57.748 --> 02:08:59.608]  And he covers a lot that's not in the book.
[02:08:59.608 --> 02:09:01.229]  Some is in the book, that isn't in the film.
[02:09:01.229 --> 02:09:09.450]  That's why we both have them together, discounted together, at InfoWarsStore.com if you want to support Joel and ourselves and yourself with information.
[02:09:09.450 --> 02:09:11.911]  You can also get the Secure Home
[02:09:12.751 --> 02:09:19.596]  Architectural Design, Construction, and Remodeling of Self-Sufficient Residences and High-Capacity Retreats.
[02:09:19.596 --> 02:09:22.778]  That book is the Bible of secure homes.
[02:09:22.778 --> 02:09:27.020]  And I really like his strategy of having, you know, more hidden areas, not as ostentatious.
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:30.143]  He's got it for people that don't have any budget or people that have giant budgets.
[02:09:30.143 --> 02:09:34.045]  That's all available at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:09:34.045 --> 02:09:36.187]  Throw a plug in.
[02:09:36.187 --> 02:09:39.809]  But that's not why he's here today so much about strategic relocation.
[02:09:39.809 --> 02:09:40.729]  He's here because
[02:09:41.630 --> 02:09:50.075]  We've always talked about North Korea could be the trigger down the road for something larger, and the Middle East is just proxy wars.
[02:09:50.075 --> 02:09:59.780]  But I wanted to go around the world with what's happening in Libya, Syria, the admissions, Mohammed Karzai coming out and saying the West runs Al Qaeda.
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:02.301]  So much of this being revealed.
[02:10:02.301 --> 02:10:09.846]  We also now have the North Korean third-generational king, is really what it is, dictator.
[02:10:10.706 --> 02:10:11.107]  I don't
[02:10:33.297 --> 02:10:40.227]  And then Joel gets into the three power blocs, the Russians, the Chinese, and then the Anglo-American establishment and their allies.
[02:10:40.227 --> 02:10:41.569]  All those groups have allies.
[02:10:41.569 --> 02:10:45.615]  There's a lot of interchange between the Communist Chinese and the Anglo-Americans.
[02:10:45.615 --> 02:10:47.457]  Joel thinks there'll be a double crossing.
[02:10:47.457 --> 02:10:49.079]  Saw a top Russian general last week.
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:11:02.389]  Former head of their intelligence operations come out and basically sound like Joel Scalzen from the Russian perspective saying they think China might double-cross them with the Anglo-Americans, but that they hope China will actually double-cross us.
[02:11:02.389 --> 02:11:04.011]  But this is all academic.
[02:11:04.011 --> 02:11:07.333]  Well, the public needs to know all this is going on.
[02:11:07.333 --> 02:11:12.057]  And then I want to look at what's happening domestically with him, also get his take.
[02:11:12.057 --> 02:11:14.859]  I see blackmail going on against the House of Windsor.
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:18.681]  And all that stuff, and against the Catholic Church.
[02:11:18.681 --> 02:11:21.424]  So a lot of stuff's moving right now.
[02:11:21.424 --> 02:11:31.891]  And so Joel Skousen, who really pants himself out of all his hats as a geopolitical analyst, I think he does a pretty good job of it, has an interesting outlook and perspective.
[02:11:31.891 --> 02:11:33.753]  So I wanted to get him on to break that down.
[02:11:33.753 --> 02:11:37.876]  Joel, there's my layout of what I'm concerned about.
[02:11:37.876 --> 02:11:40.818]  What is your overall take, first off, on North Korea?
[02:11:42.745 --> 02:11:57.514]  Well, this has been a great, provided a great deal of consternation from my subscribers to the World Affairs Brief, because I've always said that China and Russia aren't ready, and that North Korea is being preserved as a trigger event for World War III.
[02:11:57.514 --> 02:11:58.894]  It's very clear that the U.S.
[02:11:58.894 --> 02:12:02.396]  treats them very differently than Iran, for example.
[02:12:02.396 --> 02:12:11.642]  If Iran had tested nuclear weapons and had actually outright threatened the United States, we would have attacked within 24 hours, and yet when North Korea does it, everyone just says, ho-ho.
[02:12:12.537 --> 02:12:24.101]  Well, in fact, our intelligence knows, as I suspect, that North Korea is bluffing, that they have been sounding off and being a boisterous bad boy for decades.
[02:12:24.101 --> 02:12:30.422]  People forget that almost every year North Korea attacks the South Korean with physical weapons.
[02:12:30.422 --> 02:12:34.864]  We've attacked the United States, they've attacked the United States of America, the USS Pueblo.
[02:12:35.891 --> 02:12:38.412]  And we did nothing about it.
[02:12:38.412 --> 02:12:43.954]  So it's very, very clear that the United States is not intending to take on North Korea.
[02:12:43.954 --> 02:12:45.334]  It is intending to preserve it.
[02:12:45.334 --> 02:12:53.237]  It has guaranteed North Korea that they won't seek for regime change, even though it's the most tyrannical regime in the world.
[02:12:53.237 --> 02:12:56.098]  It's a literal national prison camp for everyone there.
[02:12:58.208 --> 02:13:08.672]  But I have never heard the kind of rhetoric escalation that has occurred in the past three or four days, where they're actually claiming, you know, we're going to strike you, we're going to do a preemptive strike.
[02:13:08.672 --> 02:13:24.298]  And now, one of the consultants to the Russian military has come out and said, and you have to look at these things whether or not they're true, the Russians, you know, are masters of disinformation, so you just don't know whenever they come out and speak whether or not they're putting out disinformation or not.
[02:13:24.298 --> 02:13:27.479]  But they're saying the North Korea's explosion was a plutonium explosion.
[02:13:28.530 --> 02:13:34.816]  And they got this from insider information, not from electronic monitoring, which the U.S.
[02:13:34.816 --> 02:13:39.000]  uses to determine what type of explosion North Korea is testing.
[02:13:39.744 --> 02:13:48.327]  Now, if there was a plutonium explosion, let's just suppose that the Russian is telling the truth, it couldn't have come from North Korea.
[02:13:48.327 --> 02:13:52.609]  This had to be technology transfer from Russia or China.
[02:13:52.609 --> 02:13:57.671]  And that supports what I have always said, that North Korea is a puppet state of Russia and China.
[02:13:57.671 --> 02:14:00.812]  It's not developing this stuff independently.
[02:14:00.812 --> 02:14:05.994]  China is not playing straight to the West when it claims to be trying to restrain North Korea.
[02:14:07.458 --> 02:14:21.833]  Although, ultimately, there is the restraint in the sense that I don't believe North Korea is going to be allowed to start World War III or strike South Korea in a way that will start World War III without China and Russia saying, we're ready to go to Baku.
[02:14:21.833 --> 02:14:23.855]  Yeah, Joel.
[02:14:30.758 --> 02:14:33.281]  Um, Joel, we're going to work with you during the break.
[02:14:33.281 --> 02:14:34.583]  I may be getting you to go to cell phone.
[02:14:34.583 --> 02:14:35.924]  I know you're out in the middle of nowhere right now.
[02:14:35.924 --> 02:14:43.954]  Your Skype's just, just, uh, I thought I tested it during the break, but it's just not, um, it's, it's, it's kind of hard to understand what you're saying for our audience out there.
[02:14:43.954 --> 02:14:50.401]  And it's very important, uh, specifically whenever I look, uh, at.
[02:14:51.684 --> 02:15:10.568]  Whenever I look at North Korea and study governments and body language and the way they behave and Dennis Rodman and all of it, I mean, I understand it's a client of China, but it really is its own hallucinating, bizarre world of big government and cult of personality, you know, Dark Ages type deal from my perspective.
[02:15:10.568 --> 02:15:17.390]  And I've seen the son in the year he's been in power go from a wide-eyed, you know, boarding student from Switzerland to having the demonic crazed look of
[02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:22.216]  You know, the taste of his father and grandfather before him.
[02:15:22.216 --> 02:15:26.683]  So, I mean, it looks to me like North Korea is, at a certain level, its own rogue insanity.
[02:15:26.683 --> 02:15:28.526]  I understand China's there.
[02:15:28.526 --> 02:15:33.333]  And, you know, in history, these guys do always bite off more than they can chew.
[02:15:34.454 --> 02:15:38.575]  I mean, there could be any type of interchange they've already had in the last year.
[02:15:38.575 --> 02:15:42.776]  Artillery barrages, people getting killed, shooting at each other, ships being grabbed.
[02:15:42.776 --> 02:15:46.737]  I know this has been going on for 60 years, right at 60 years.
[02:15:46.737 --> 02:15:54.759]  But, I mean, am I wrong in saying this is a cresting of events?
[02:15:54.759 --> 02:15:56.979]  Your last remark, are you wrong in saying that?
[02:15:56.979 --> 02:15:59.000]  I mean, is this a cresting of events?
[02:16:00.327 --> 02:16:03.511]  As I say, my gut feeling is that it is not.
[02:16:03.511 --> 02:16:09.577]  What I think is happening here is that China's allowing the rhetoric to escalate.
[02:16:09.577 --> 02:16:11.399]  And remember, this is a very young guy.
[02:16:11.399 --> 02:16:12.661]  He's not running the show.
[02:16:12.661 --> 02:16:17.165]  This is the same old military oligarch behind him that's really running the show.
[02:16:17.165 --> 02:16:18.587]  Sure, but they look completely insane.
[02:16:18.587 --> 02:16:20.169]  I mean, they look like psychopaths when you look at them.
[02:16:21.141 --> 02:16:26.523]  But what I'm saying is, China's allowing North Korea to escalate because this suits their purpose.
[02:16:26.523 --> 02:16:38.406]  Remember, China and Russia don't necessarily want to get blamed for North Korea starting the war, so it's in their interest to let North Korea appear as if it's out of control.
[02:16:38.406 --> 02:16:39.607]  It is, in my opinion.
[02:16:40.507 --> 02:16:45.348]  That when North Korea does a full-on strike of South Korea, the only way the U.S.
[02:16:45.348 --> 02:16:48.829]  will be able to stop that is with tactical nuclear weapons.
[02:16:48.829 --> 02:16:54.771]  I mean, the overwhelming military strength of North Korea versus the South and versus the puny 13,000 U.S.
[02:16:54.771 --> 02:16:57.712]  troops we have there is literally undefensible.
[02:16:58.564 --> 02:17:00.166]  Without tactical nuclear weapons.
[02:17:00.166 --> 02:17:01.027]  So if the U.S.
[02:17:01.027 --> 02:17:08.554]  responds with tactical nukes, then China and Russia have the excuse to come in and say, ah, the U.S.
[02:17:08.554 --> 02:17:14.040]  started a nuclear war, we're going to respond.
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:14.701]  Absolutely.
[02:17:16.505 --> 02:17:21.550]  That makes sense what you're saying, but I mean, I look at these clowns, these generals.
[02:17:21.550 --> 02:17:25.194]  I mean, I've tried to study North Korea, and I know you've studied it as well.
[02:17:25.194 --> 02:17:26.515]  What is the power structure there?
[02:17:26.515 --> 02:17:35.884]  We know it's the military and that whole system, but they have the same... I mean, I've never seen government people in any film reels anywhere.
[02:17:35.884 --> 02:17:38.867]  Nazis, Soviets, Maoists, look this crazy.
[02:17:39.769 --> 02:17:44.075]  Uh, and, and, and, you know, just, just total disconnect from reality on a power trip.
[02:17:44.075 --> 02:17:45.797]  I mean, they look totally insane.
[02:17:45.797 --> 02:17:51.826]  Are there, are there any communist Chinese behind them that we're not seeing that are actually running these sycophants?
[02:17:52.782 --> 02:17:53.843]  Yes, there are, Alex.
[02:17:53.843 --> 02:17:59.187]  There are Chinese generals assigned full-time to the North Korean military as advisors.
[02:17:59.187 --> 02:18:02.530]  And believe me, they turn the screws and they control what happens.
[02:18:02.530 --> 02:18:06.794]  But you have to remember the North Korean military mentality.
[02:18:06.794 --> 02:18:10.937]  They've been living in a martial law state for 60 years now.
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:14.244]  They live by hype.
[02:18:14.244 --> 02:18:16.047]  They have to hype all of the military.
[02:18:16.047 --> 02:18:17.609]  The war is imminent.
[02:18:17.609 --> 02:18:23.539]  They have to continue driving people with excuses and driving their own... So as it collapses, that makes sense.
[02:18:23.539 --> 02:18:25.522]  They've got to hyper-escalate the hype.
[02:18:27.233 --> 02:18:34.318]  And so they keep their people believing in the military state of siege that they're living under by this hype.
[02:18:34.318 --> 02:18:41.283]  But it does not mean, in my opinion, that they're ready, because ultimately China will control when they go.
[02:18:41.283 --> 02:18:45.687]  Believe me, Alex, this is the only thing we've got to go in that China and Russia are not ready yet.
[02:18:46.167 --> 02:19:00.925]  You'll see a year from now, this wave will pass, even though other incidents of rhetoric will escalate, but the strike on the South in a World War III scenario, I don't believe will happen for several years yet.
[02:19:01.365 --> 02:19:05.349]  Well, we're going to go to break, and I want to get into the geopolitical ways this fits in from your perspective.
[02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:07.371]  I mean, that's really what is going on.
[02:19:07.371 --> 02:19:19.102]  You can debate when it's going to happen or what the total agenda is, but for the general listeners, what the power structure is, what's happening in the Middle East, what's happening with the Vatican, what's happening domestically with the L.A.
[02:19:19.102 --> 02:19:22.945]  Times and the Southern Poverty Law Center, the most radical rhetoric I've ever seen.
[02:19:22.945 --> 02:19:24.427]  Is it a sign of weakness or strength?
[02:19:24.867 --> 02:19:27.708]  That they're saying white Christians are terrorists.
[02:19:27.708 --> 02:19:35.552]  I mean, that is inherently like Hitler saying Jews are terrorists, or Soviets saying, you know, capitalists are terrorists.
[02:19:35.552 --> 02:19:39.494]  And that we need task force, task forces to come after us.
[02:19:39.494 --> 02:19:43.356]  The flipping from Al-Qaeda being the reason we have unmanned security on the American people.
[02:19:43.356 --> 02:19:50.220]  We're going to go there with Joel Skousen as well, right here on InfoWars, the radio transmission tonight.

[02:22:24.912 --> 02:22:34.238]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:34.238 --> 02:22:35.039]  This capitalism?
[02:22:35.039 --> 02:22:41.323]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:41.323 --> 02:22:42.124]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:42.124 --> 02:22:45.266]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:22:45.266 --> 02:22:46.186]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:22:46.186 --> 02:22:47.607]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:22:47.607 --> 02:22:47.927]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.927 --> 02:22:48.188]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.112 --> 02:22:57.493]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:22:57.493 --> 02:23:00.794]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:23:00.794 --> 02:23:06.936]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will shock you.
[02:23:06.936 --> 02:23:14.759]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:23:15.799 --> 02:23:19.163]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:23:19.163 --> 02:23:21.305]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:23:21.305 --> 02:23:28.792]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:23:28.792 --> 02:23:33.277]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:23:33.777 --> 02:23:39.999]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:23:39.999 --> 02:23:41.360]  You'll be shocked.
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:46.561]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:23:46.561 --> 02:23:52.043]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:23:52.043 --> 02:23:53.404]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:24:15.063 --> 02:24:16.083]  Alright, this is a short segment.
[02:24:16.083 --> 02:24:21.205]  We're going to get into domestic stuff with Joel in the next segment, but finishing up with North Korea.
[02:24:21.205 --> 02:24:29.668]  Look, I'm not pro-war, because I know the globalists use war to get us into debt, and they don't care about actually helping countries, and I don't like an imperial mode.
[02:24:29.668 --> 02:24:41.612]  You know, Vietnam that you were in, all this stuff is bad, obviously, and the globalists were funding the Russians to fund the Chinese to fund Vietnam, North Vietnam, you know, while my uncle was over there, and while you were over there.
[02:24:42.532 --> 02:24:51.654]  But expanding on this, when I see North Korea and the power trip and how they break up the families and put them in forced labor camps...
[02:24:52.546 --> 02:24:56.728]  And then, you know, that guy's sitting there getting in everybody's face.
[02:24:56.728 --> 02:25:01.970]  And I know the West likes it as an excuse to keep troops in Japan and troops in South Korea.
[02:25:01.970 --> 02:25:04.911]  Isn't there some way outside of their system?
[02:25:04.911 --> 02:25:10.654]  Is there any way North Korea could ever become freed, at least to some extent?
[02:25:10.654 --> 02:25:15.956]  I mean, I just I mean, if they're going to drone innocent villages to kill one bad guy, I just
[02:25:16.516 --> 02:25:22.224]  You know, somebody's there in an artillery barrage doing tests saying, I may attack you, prepare to fire.
[02:25:22.224 --> 02:25:24.266]  North Korea prepares to strike.
[02:25:24.266 --> 02:25:30.114]  I mean, isn't it in self-defense to get rid of that regime?
[02:25:30.114 --> 02:25:31.256]  Is there any way to do that?
[02:25:35.168 --> 02:25:37.129]  There really isn't.
[02:25:37.129 --> 02:25:43.951]  Because, you see, anybody in the West that is controlled by the globalists knows that we don't want to get rid of that regime.
[02:25:43.951 --> 02:25:46.392]  We want it there to start World War III.
[02:25:46.392 --> 02:25:54.074]  You know, that's what Americans have trouble grasping, is that our government, our globalist establishment, wants this war.
[02:25:54.074 --> 02:26:00.436]  It is what will finally drive Western people into a militarized new world order, and nothing else will do it.
[02:26:00.956 --> 02:26:06.058]  Not boiling the frog, not slow gradualism, not treaties with the UN.
[02:26:06.058 --> 02:26:09.419]  We'll rebel eventually against those when they get too onerous.
[02:26:09.419 --> 02:26:11.980]  It's only war that will drive so.
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:14.621]  There's nobody in the West that wants to get rid of North Korea.
[02:26:14.621 --> 02:26:18.282]  They like that provocation and that's why it's going to remain.
[02:26:18.282 --> 02:26:21.463]  Well, something that backs up what you're saying is that I've looked at the numbers.
[02:26:21.463 --> 02:26:21.904]  The U.S.
[02:26:21.904 --> 02:26:27.986]  has more than half the world's, about 53% depending on the year, of total defense spending worldwide.
[02:26:29.266 --> 02:26:42.589]  And then that's not counting black budget spending, but the underground tunnelers, the underground bases, the Adam and Eve centers, you know, the emergency vaults, the food vaults, the redoubts, and now U.S.
[02:26:42.589 --> 02:26:48.470]  Air Force plans to build a huge network of underground tunnels, effort to make nuclear missiles less vulnerable to attack.
[02:26:48.470 --> 02:26:50.490]  That's come out in inside defense.
[02:26:50.490 --> 02:26:51.890]  That's been happening for a long time.
[02:26:51.890 --> 02:26:53.310]  Talk about underground bases.
[02:26:53.310 --> 02:26:55.931]  What do you make of them being public about this right now?
[02:26:59.181 --> 02:27:03.825]  I don't think that that system will ever get built and I don't think it's effective.
[02:27:03.825 --> 02:27:15.855]  The reason is, it's just like the railroad track system they designed for Utah as an alternative where they were going to put the MXs to drive them around on tracks to avoid getting targeted.
[02:27:15.855 --> 02:27:22.340]  That would have actually worked, but taking them to underground bases will not work because you've got to have pop-up silos.
[02:27:23.642 --> 02:27:25.763]  at periodic and those are fixed.
[02:27:25.763 --> 02:27:34.207]  They're just as easy for the Russians to detect as the missile silos, maybe half as easy to detect as the missile silos, but they're fixed points.
[02:27:34.207 --> 02:27:40.409]  So all they've got to do is target those pop-up points from the Underground Railroad and you defeat the system.
[02:27:40.409 --> 02:27:45.071]  So I don't see it as going to be able to work at all.
[02:27:45.071 --> 02:27:46.452]  Now let me just say though that
[02:27:47.594 --> 02:28:00.325]  Well, I'm actually glad to see them come out in the open about building underground tunnels because there's been an awful lot of garbage come out on the net about nuclear boring machines and tunnels much more than exist.
[02:28:00.325 --> 02:28:02.947]  I mean, nuclear boring machines do not exist.
[02:28:02.947 --> 02:28:07.471]  You can't melt down rocks and have anybody survive.
[02:28:07.471 --> 02:28:09.913]  You still have lava to get rid of.
[02:28:09.913 --> 02:28:11.935]  But they do have big tunneling machines.
[02:28:11.935 --> 02:28:12.996]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:28:13.616 --> 02:28:27.129]  But what I'm just trying to debunk is, you know, some of the videos that have been out there about the trucker who was actually at one of the Missouri sites, which does have a bunch of underground caverns, and they talked him into saying I drove to Washington, D.C.
[02:28:27.129 --> 02:28:27.590]  underground.
[02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:28.270]  It's just bogus.
[02:28:28.270 --> 02:28:31.413]  No, but I will tell you, there are underground tunnels here in Texas.
[02:28:32.094 --> 02:28:36.196]  Yes, but what I'm saying is you have to get rid of the dirt.
[02:28:36.196 --> 02:28:43.600]  There is no nuclear disappearing dirt machine and there are literally mountains of dirt that have to come out.
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:48.822]  No, there's artificial mountains at Fort Hood from when they built these in the 50s and 60s.
[02:28:48.822 --> 02:28:49.382]  I understand.
[02:28:49.382 --> 02:28:52.244]  You can track all that, but there's no way that we track.
[02:28:53.064 --> 02:28:55.125]  Tunnels the length of going to Washington, D.C.
[02:28:55.125 --> 02:28:56.625]  That's a mountain the size of Mount St.
[02:28:56.625 --> 02:28:57.545]  Helens, you know.
[02:28:57.545 --> 02:28:58.626]  Can't do it.
[02:28:58.626 --> 02:29:09.049]  So I'm just saying, there are tunnels, there are underground bases, they're all over Area 51 and under a lot of other things, but they're not to the extent that some of the phony people are putting out on the web.
[02:29:09.049 --> 02:29:10.509]  So we have to be careful.
[02:29:10.509 --> 02:29:16.631]  Sure, no, I mean, what they've got in Texas was built to the SAC base, and this is classified, folks.
[02:29:16.631 --> 02:29:19.232]  I mean, I know this from family that's seen it.
[02:29:19.232 --> 02:29:21.073]  It runs from
[02:29:22.253 --> 02:29:23.033]  We're on the march.
[02:29:23.033 --> 02:29:24.014]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:49.466 --> 02:29:56.750]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:57.831]  I had tried everything.
[02:29:57.831 --> 02:30:00.192]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:30:00.192 --> 02:30:03.314]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:30:03.314 --> 02:30:08.157]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:30:08.157 --> 02:30:14.521]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:30:15.001 --> 02:30:26.212]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:30:26.212 --> 02:30:30.696]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:30:30.696 --> 02:30:33.699]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[02:30:34.039 --> 02:30:36.942]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:30:36.942 --> 02:30:38.503]  Now that's results.
[02:30:38.503 --> 02:30:45.288]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[02:30:45.288 --> 02:30:51.033]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[02:31:56.747 --> 02:32:05.292]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:32:05.292 --> 02:32:08.974]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[02:32:08.974 --> 02:32:13.436]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[02:32:13.436 --> 02:32:18.119]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[02:32:39.250 --> 02:32:39.750]  We're good to go.
[02:33:24.890 --> 02:33:26.231]  Alex Jones here back live.
[02:33:26.231 --> 02:33:28.612]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday edition.
[02:33:28.612 --> 02:33:31.453]  I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:31.453 --> 02:33:39.356]  Central with the Sunday syndicated radio broadcast picked up by stations like 590 AM right here in Texas and over.
[02:33:39.356 --> 02:33:44.359]  It's close to 100 affiliates on the weekend show, over 150 on the weekday broadcast.
[02:33:44.359 --> 02:33:48.140]  A lot of the affiliates cross over but a lot of affiliates only carry the Sunday show.
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:50.281]  So it's a very important broadcast.
[02:33:50.281 --> 02:33:54.003]  It's also important to support this show but also support yourself with the information.
[02:33:55.476 --> 02:34:09.484]  We do carry the excellent documentary film that I produced, Strategic Relocation, Joel Skousen details the safest places to live and how to secure your home on a region-by-region basis, and it really is in-depth.
[02:34:09.484 --> 02:34:21.070]  And we also carry his book, The Secure Home, and we also carry Strategic Relocation, the big color, thick book, third edition, which is the latest info on your region, your area.
[02:34:21.070 --> 02:34:24.052]  Not just where, if you can move anywhere, where does he think the safest area is?
[02:34:25.032 --> 02:34:28.733]  I've talked to a lot of other experts also that concur with this analysis.
[02:34:28.733 --> 02:34:31.054]  But if you have to stay in your region, where's the best area?
[02:34:31.054 --> 02:34:34.555]  I mean, I've used this information myself and family has.
[02:34:34.555 --> 02:34:35.615]  It's very important.
[02:34:35.615 --> 02:34:44.098]  All available at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsShop.com or click on the shopping cart link at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:34:44.098 --> 02:34:46.179]  And we're fighting the construction of the prison planet.
[02:34:46.579 --> 02:34:57.764]  It doesn't matter if you have a Russian bloc, a Chinese bloc, the Anglo-American globalist bloc, they all basically have the same systems, whatever the latest control is, to consolidate power.
[02:34:57.764 --> 02:34:59.765]  But they do fight with each other at certain levels.
[02:34:59.765 --> 02:35:01.266]  And Joel, I wanted to get your take.
[02:35:02.106 --> 02:35:13.834]  On where you see things geopolitically right now, how the system's handling the fact that it's coming out to the West, runs Al Qaeda, and that most of this stuff is inside jobs, how they're trying to flip.
[02:35:13.834 --> 02:35:16.095]  I don't know if you've seen it, but knowing you, you have.
[02:35:16.095 --> 02:35:20.518]  The LA Times came out and said white Christian gun owners are inherently terrorists.
[02:35:20.518 --> 02:35:21.539]  I read the quotes yesterday.
[02:35:23.339 --> 02:35:29.882]  And they went on to basically say they're a greater threat than Al-Qaeda, worse than Al-Qaeda, go after them.
[02:35:29.882 --> 02:35:37.725]  They use words like they're belligerent, they need to be taught, and they're horrible, and there's no new world order, and there's no gun control.
[02:35:37.725 --> 02:35:41.346]  I mean, it's just cartoonish until you realize
[02:35:42.026 --> 02:35:47.869]  That they're openly in the training manuals that we broke four years ago, shifting none of it's al Qaeda now.
[02:35:47.869 --> 02:35:52.271]  It's gun owners, preppers, libertarians, returning veterans.
[02:35:52.271 --> 02:35:59.194]  If I was the Soviet takeover, and I know the globalists aren't Soviets but they're using that same management system, of a country, say Romania or something,
[02:36:00.214 --> 02:36:01.936]  This is how I would do it.
[02:36:01.936 --> 02:36:06.562]  And it's such incredible proof that these are the bad guys.
[02:36:06.562 --> 02:36:08.565]  I just can't believe they're getting away with it.
[02:36:08.565 --> 02:36:10.387]  What is the method to it?
[02:36:10.387 --> 02:36:11.588]  What's your take on that?
[02:36:11.588 --> 02:36:14.913]  And then, like I said, let's get into some of the other geopolitical things, Joel.
[02:36:16.237 --> 02:36:31.689]  Well, it's very interesting because it is precisely the same way in which they have gotten a lot of fundamentalist Muslims to rise up with even more fervor against the United States by provoking them, by actually threatening them and occupying them.
[02:36:31.689 --> 02:36:33.491]  What have they done in the United States?
[02:36:33.491 --> 02:36:43.639]  They've actually come up with very draconian statements and draconian gun laws and threatened our fundamental rights, especially in terms of assault weapons.
[02:36:43.639 --> 02:36:45.741]  And so they've got the American right
[02:36:46.758 --> 02:36:51.800]  To come out and reaffirm that this is not just about self-defense, the Second Amendment.
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:53.301]  It's not just about hunting.
[02:36:53.301 --> 02:36:56.382]  It's about defending against tyranny.
[02:36:56.382 --> 02:37:05.947]  And so all of a sudden they're taking all of these quotes about sheriffs and all of us coming out and correctly stating our position and saying, you see, they're going to go to war against the government.
[02:37:07.085 --> 02:37:22.534]  In other words, they've provoked us into coming out in open and focusing on the ultimate purpose of the Second Amendment and then turning that against us by saying, just look at how many are out there claiming that they're going to defend themselves with their weapons against us, the government.
[02:37:22.534 --> 02:37:23.214]  We're the friends.
[02:37:23.214 --> 02:37:25.495]  We're not going to take away their guns.
[02:37:25.495 --> 02:37:26.256]  Well, they're clearly.
[02:37:26.256 --> 02:37:33.560]  The Southern Poverty Law Conference, of course, is the one who has engendered all of these articles from the LA Times to others.
[02:37:34.266 --> 02:37:41.090]  You know, coming out, having the audacity to talk about phony conspiracy theories that Obama wanted to take away their guns.
[02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:42.832]  Well, it's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:37:42.832 --> 02:37:44.132]  It's a fact.
[02:37:44.132 --> 02:37:49.055]  It's an admitted fact by the administration, by Dianne Feinstein, and the rest.
[02:37:49.055 --> 02:37:52.137]  But it's interesting that I find that we've fallen into their trap.
[02:37:52.137 --> 02:38:00.443]  They've provoked us to come out and defend our position, and now they're using our defensive position to prove that we are a threat.
[02:38:00.443 --> 02:38:03.845]  I don't know how there is any way to combat that kind of stuff.
[02:38:05.137 --> 02:38:17.563]  They are trying to force a confrontation, and I've seen the TV shows, the movies, the behind-the-scenes training, now that they're going public, saying being white is inherently an act of terror, being a Christian is inherently an act of terror.
[02:38:17.563 --> 02:38:25.027]  That means, in my past experience, that's when they do a false flag, is when they've done all these preparations and then go public.
[02:38:25.027 --> 02:38:29.009]  That's when they do the Oklahoma City, the Fast and Furious, the 9-11.
[02:38:29.009 --> 02:38:29.930]  Do you concur with that?
[02:38:31.468 --> 02:38:33.109]  In the long run, yes.
[02:38:33.109 --> 02:38:43.295]  It's the same thing that happened in Nazi Germany and the denigration of the Jews and then blaming them for things and having a few false flag operations.
[02:38:43.295 --> 02:38:47.758]  But the Nazis, interestingly enough, did things fairly rapidly and crudely.
[02:38:49.261 --> 02:38:54.565]  It's been my estimation that the powers that be that we're dealing with have learned a lot from that time.
[02:38:54.565 --> 02:38:57.228]  A bit more sophisticated, take a little bit longer view.
[02:38:57.228 --> 02:38:59.830]  It isn't necessarily imminent.
[02:38:59.830 --> 02:39:08.857]  You know, because of our history of liberty in this nation, it's taking a lot longer to accustom the American people.
[02:39:08.857 --> 02:39:12.720]  You know, the Germans were really a yes-man type society.
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:13.721]  They were militaristic.
[02:39:13.721 --> 02:39:15.562]  They were believed in falling orders.
[02:39:15.562 --> 02:39:18.705]  It was pretty easy to railroad them to go along with things.
[02:39:19.545 --> 02:39:23.417]  You know, they built a tremendous opposition in the United States.
[02:39:23.417 --> 02:39:26.527]  We've got, I estimate, nearly a third of Americans.
[02:39:27.099 --> 02:39:31.360]  Who are vehemently suspicious of government and not inclined to go along with it.
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:35.162]  Oh, well, they had a poll that now 70% are, but I agree, 30% are hardcore.
[02:39:35.162 --> 02:39:36.982]  So I see it backfiring on them.
[02:39:36.982 --> 02:39:43.145]  And the fact that they've gone with the slow approach shows that we're overall winning at many levels.
[02:39:43.145 --> 02:39:48.266]  And Brzezinski's written a book, given speeches, saying their program's about 10 years behind.
[02:39:48.266 --> 02:39:50.127]  I tend to agree with that.
[02:39:50.127 --> 02:39:52.108]  I don't think that's them playing possum.
[02:39:52.108 --> 02:39:52.828]  Do you disagree with that?
[02:39:54.679 --> 02:39:55.840]  No, they're not playing possum.
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:59.822]  They're working very hard to move the American people off center.
[02:39:59.822 --> 02:40:03.704]  And, you know, Sandy Hook was one of those seminal events that helped do that.
[02:40:03.704 --> 02:40:05.845]  But do you agree that they're behind?
[02:40:05.845 --> 02:40:07.866]  Oh, absolutely they're behind.
[02:40:07.866 --> 02:40:14.470]  I mean, we knew from 2004 they were trying to pull off this, to goad the Israelis into attacking Iran, and it hasn't happened yet.
[02:40:15.288 --> 02:40:26.172]  And, you know, even I thought it would happen by the spring already, and yet they still haven't been able to knock off Assad in Syria, and they can't attack Iran until Assad's out of the way.
[02:40:26.172 --> 02:40:30.153]  And so things are definitely behind schedule.
[02:40:30.153 --> 02:40:34.735]  But, you know, they've got a long-term view here, and they'll take whatever time, whatever it takes.
[02:40:34.735 --> 02:40:41.057]  But the one thing that they won't do, Alex, they won't pull off martial law without a significant excuse.
[02:40:42.205 --> 02:40:46.748]  That would actually convert the rest of the Americans into saying, wow, our government really is out of control.
[02:40:46.748 --> 02:40:48.209]  They won't do that.
[02:40:48.209 --> 02:40:51.912]  Well, they're close to doing it now.
[02:40:51.912 --> 02:40:58.196]  And ultimately much bigger major events to justify the kind of draconian things that we know that they're preparing for ultimately.
[02:40:59.142 --> 02:40:59.582]  Sure.
[02:40:59.582 --> 02:41:04.966]  What do you make of their denial of 2 billion bullets, 2,700 giant armored vehicles?
[02:41:04.966 --> 02:41:15.593]  All that's admitted, and I see that backfiring as other mainstream media is forced to admit it is true, while they have all the White House organs saying it's not true.
[02:41:15.593 --> 02:41:16.554]  You know what?
[02:41:16.554 --> 02:41:25.320]  I really think they're having trouble with the fact that so many people are out there and really see what they're doing.
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:26.921]  Well, actually, I think
[02:41:27.799 --> 02:41:34.344]  When I look at all of the numbers of bullets that they've claimed to be ordering, in fact, the orders aren't there.
[02:41:34.344 --> 02:41:36.266]  Those are potential orders.
[02:41:36.266 --> 02:41:37.026]  Sure.
[02:41:37.026 --> 02:41:39.368]  It's typical in federal contracting.
[02:41:39.368 --> 02:41:41.830]  But even the potential orders are way out of line.
[02:41:41.830 --> 02:41:46.614]  I'm actually convinced now that all of these orders are meant to draw us out.
[02:41:47.461 --> 02:41:51.704]  They want to draw out a very strong and vigorous action from us.
[02:41:51.704 --> 02:41:53.946]  It does speak of tyranny.
[02:41:53.946 --> 02:42:00.251]  It's like the 2717 MRAP vehicles that they're repurposing from Iran.
[02:42:00.251 --> 02:42:01.252]  It's real.
[02:42:01.252 --> 02:42:03.093]  Those are not all going to Homeland Security.
[02:42:03.093 --> 02:42:06.916]  They're in fact bidding those out to local law enforcement.
[02:42:07.837 --> 02:42:09.378]  So that it's distributed.
[02:42:09.378 --> 02:42:17.504]  But what I'm saying is, it got us all upset, the internet came alive, and it basically reinforced that tyranny was coming.
[02:42:17.504 --> 02:42:20.446]  But they're using that against us.
[02:42:20.446 --> 02:42:27.490]  Sure, what about the paper targets of five-year-old kids and then admitting they demanded, you know, two million dollars worth of them?
[02:42:27.490 --> 02:42:32.374]  I mean, you're saying they're trying to absolutely cause an uprising.
[02:42:33.447 --> 02:42:35.549]  No, they're trying to bait us.
[02:42:35.549 --> 02:42:41.473]  They're trying to bait us into a verbal reaction that they can justify claiming that we're domestic terrorists.
[02:42:41.473 --> 02:42:50.640]  And that's why this is focused and coincides with the Southern Poverty Law Conference, which is basically a government-paid process.
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:52.962]  And they're trying to draw us out.
[02:42:52.962 --> 02:42:58.466]  So that's why I say I've tried to be, you know, very careful.
[02:42:59.213 --> 02:43:04.556]  Not to overhype any of these situations, knowing that they're trying to make us look radical.
[02:43:04.556 --> 02:43:07.458]  And in fact, they're feeding us.
[02:43:07.458 --> 02:43:10.019]  Joe, you know, that's one area I think I might disagree with you a little bit.
[02:43:10.019 --> 02:43:13.001]  You know, like take the John Birch Society.
[02:43:13.001 --> 02:43:21.365]  They've always tried to be so conservative and so, you know, they wouldn't report on black helicopters for like 10 years and there were urban warfare drills everywhere.
[02:43:21.365 --> 02:43:28.089]  I think it's good that I blow up at people and do all this because the public is in such a trance.
[02:43:29.085 --> 02:43:35.290]  That you've got to shake them out of it, and if somebody's house is on fire, and they won't wake up, you've got to yell and scream.
[02:43:35.290 --> 02:43:44.757]  And I'm not saying that that's necessarily that you disagree with that, but, I mean, it's hurting them, the bullets of little kids, you know, the signs of little kids, the targets.
[02:43:44.757 --> 02:43:51.782]  It's hurting them, and I agree with you, they want to bring all this out, try to get everybody to get upset.
[02:43:52.783 --> 02:43:55.445]  Lie to the public and then say, look, these people are crazy.
[02:43:55.445 --> 02:43:59.587]  But that's not the vacuum they're in anymore.
[02:43:59.587 --> 02:44:01.268]  I don't see it working.
[02:44:01.268 --> 02:44:03.509]  Joel, I'm not bragging when I say this.
[02:44:03.509 --> 02:44:04.930]  It's so people know what our numbers are.
[02:44:06.122 --> 02:44:08.643]  I go to a restaurant anywhere in the U.S.
[02:44:08.643 --> 02:44:13.984]  now, and everyone's looking at me, and people try to buy my food, and the waiters all come over.
[02:44:13.984 --> 02:44:17.324]  I mean, I go down the green belt, and every other person that walks by me is a listener.
[02:44:17.324 --> 02:44:20.145]  I don't see those numbers, actually, when I look at our numbers.
[02:44:20.145 --> 02:44:20.985]  I mean, it is a lot.
[02:44:20.985 --> 02:44:22.886]  Fifteen million a week, one way or another.
[02:44:22.886 --> 02:44:24.726]  But it's huge.
[02:44:24.726 --> 02:44:31.447]  And so I'm saying our numbers of liberty lovers are probably higher than even you or I think.
[02:44:31.447 --> 02:44:31.768]  And I think...
[02:44:33.848 --> 02:44:34.228]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:44:34.228 --> 02:44:34.909]  There's room for both.
[02:44:53.252 --> 02:44:58.974]  You've got to remember, though, that most of the people listening to you are on our side already, and they're getting very aware.
[02:44:58.974 --> 02:45:00.115]  And I talk to a lot of them.
[02:45:00.115 --> 02:45:03.176]  They come to me a lot after hearing you, frankly.
[02:45:03.176 --> 02:45:07.458]  And so I interact with them a lot, and they ask me, what do you think about this and this?
[02:45:07.458 --> 02:45:09.058]  And so I give my opinion.
[02:45:09.058 --> 02:45:21.023]  But there is a certain element that the government knows about that are listening to you who will tend to, and they're hoping to, goad them into doing something wild to taint all of it.
[02:45:22.194 --> 02:45:32.918]  And so I'm just saying that keeping both sides in a full range of possibilities is important on your show, as well as exactly what you're doing.
[02:45:32.918 --> 02:45:36.200]  So I'm not criticizing, I'm just saying... Oh no, I don't mind criticism.
[02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:37.980]  I want your real view.
[02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:40.361]  But I'm certainly not a controlled person.
[02:45:40.361 --> 02:45:41.742]  I just go from the gut and my intellect.
[02:45:42.522 --> 02:45:49.708]  All I know is, is that desperate times mean desperate measures, and calling them out for what they are is essential, which you and others do.
[02:45:49.708 --> 02:45:51.629]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:45:51.629 --> 02:45:53.190]  So many other weird things are going on.
[02:45:53.190 --> 02:46:04.459]  Sex scandals tied into the royal family with kids, and Jimmy Savelle, and the Vatican, and all these cardinals resigning, and all this weirdness, and this Jesuit Pope.
[02:46:04.459 --> 02:46:05.740]  Now, all that.
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:09.163]  I mean, I see a lot of stuff moving right now.
[02:46:09.163 --> 02:46:10.724]  Is this tied together, or what's going on?
[02:46:12.597 --> 02:46:26.402]  Well, it's tied together in the sense that the dark side of government, the dark side of life is a cesspool of pedophilia, it's a cesspool of homosexuality, of child molestation and abuse.
[02:46:26.402 --> 02:46:36.205]  It's into our systems of federal government paying states to get people, children out of homes and into foster care where a lot of them are abused.
[02:46:36.205 --> 02:46:38.586]  It's really a problem between judges and these things.
[02:46:39.498 --> 02:46:41.199]  And it's into the Vatican as well.
[02:46:41.199 --> 02:46:46.062]  The Vatican's got tremendous problems in terms of financial scandals, money laundering.
[02:46:46.062 --> 02:46:50.064]  The Jesuits have been a problem for years because there's two basic sides.
[02:46:50.064 --> 02:46:56.968]  The majority of Jesuits have become radical revolutionaries, not just ideological leftists.
[02:46:56.968 --> 02:47:02.831]  As I analyzed in today's World Affairs Brief, the current Pope is an ideological leftist.
[02:47:03.471 --> 02:47:04.671]  He's not a revolutionary.
[02:47:04.671 --> 02:47:12.333]  In fact, he fingered a couple of his own revolutionary priests in Argentina, and the left has not forgiven him for that.
[02:47:12.333 --> 02:47:18.035]  So, this is not a Jesuit pope in the sense of a revolutionary pope.
[02:47:18.035 --> 02:47:21.956]  This is a go-along, try-to-get-along, leftist agenda.
[02:47:21.956 --> 02:47:23.676]  I think it's more of the same.
[02:47:23.676 --> 02:47:28.097]  Somebody who's not going to oppose the general globalist trend that the former popes
[02:47:28.647 --> 02:47:31.228]  So he's a capitulation.
[02:47:31.228 --> 02:47:35.809]  They're calling him a sharp political operator in the British press that's been after the Vatican.
[02:47:35.809 --> 02:47:42.091]  I am seeing the establishment cuddling up, but I thought that might have just been because he's new.
[02:47:42.091 --> 02:47:43.711]  Well, I think he's a compromise.
[02:47:43.711 --> 02:47:47.332]  I mean, he by no means won by a very strong majority.
[02:47:47.332 --> 02:47:49.093]  He was in a high running last time.
[02:47:49.093 --> 02:47:57.735]  There are factions trying to control the Vatican, and there's infighting that goes on within the globalist establishment, within the Russians, within the Chinese, and within the Vatican.
[02:47:58.476 --> 02:48:17.659]  And I won't claim to know, you know, even a portion of the insider dealings, but I know where they're going ultimately, and I think you do too, and they're all combining, trying to control a new world order, trying to, you know, have their portion of the pie, and there's going to be infighting, and that's what we're seeing.
[02:48:17.659 --> 02:48:20.600]  Russians and Chinese are going to go at it eventually.
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:26.481]  I think, though, that because this is a satanic-based, multifaceted conspiracy, that ultimately,
[02:48:27.358 --> 02:48:30.180]  The smartest and the brightest are the Anglo-American Senate.
[02:48:30.180 --> 02:48:37.685]  They're meant to rule, and we are head-to-head with the worst of the conspiracies that have ever been on the face of the earth.
[02:48:37.685 --> 02:48:38.706]  It's sophisticated.
[02:48:38.706 --> 02:48:44.049]  We're going to have to be not just careful, but vocal as well.
[02:48:44.049 --> 02:48:45.610]  It is incredibly sophisticated.
[02:48:45.610 --> 02:48:52.015]  To even grasp it makes your head spin, and that's why the public in so many levels doesn't really have a lot of
[02:48:53.655 --> 02:48:59.922]  A lot of options because it's just so sophisticated and there's wheels within wheels.
[02:48:59.922 --> 02:49:06.330]  How do we ever get the people to wake up and understand this if they can't even understand that basic liberty is the way to go?
[02:49:07.096 --> 02:49:23.540]  Well, that's one of the reasons why I'm working on a new documentary book called The Modern History of Conspiratorial Power, where I'm going to try and lay it out in a way that will be accessible for people to share with their other friends and get them to believe more in the complexity of conspiracy.
[02:49:24.252 --> 02:49:26.293]  We've had too simplistic of a view before.
[02:49:26.293 --> 02:49:29.855]  In the Goldwater years, it used to be the communist conspiracy was it.
[02:49:29.855 --> 02:49:35.077]  And then when Cleon Skousen came out with the Naked Capitalist, we started to realize the globalists were involved.
[02:49:35.077 --> 02:49:40.099]  And then the Birch Society thought the globalists controlled the communists, and so there wouldn't be war.
[02:49:40.099 --> 02:49:42.420]  And it's much more sophisticated than that.
[02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:52.325]  It's a synergy of evil with Satan basically using a free market system to purify the essence of wickedness to command the planet.
[02:49:53.424 --> 02:50:00.349]  That's right, and Alex, what I think is that we're not going to win in the sense of winning the majority over.
[02:50:00.349 --> 02:50:03.991]  The majority has never ever been enlightened and never will.
[02:50:03.991 --> 02:50:17.781]  But events, not only like this World War, I think will be a seminal event in the history of the world, because not only will it drive the United States into a New World Order or allow the globals to talk the people into getting into a militarized New World Order,
[02:50:18.576 --> 02:50:21.659]  It will drive the good people out from the big cities.
[02:50:21.659 --> 02:50:42.877]  That's why strategic relocation is so important before it happens, because if you don't relocate voluntarily to safer areas before this all happens, when nuclear war comes, and EMP, and all of those things, there's no electricity for months, people won't have any excuse of a job tying them to these big cities, and they will be driven out.
[02:50:44.645 --> 02:50:46.386]  Wow, let's break that down.
[02:50:46.386 --> 02:50:47.727]  We come back with Joel Skousen.
[02:50:47.727 --> 02:50:49.108]  This is powerful information.
[02:50:49.108 --> 02:50:50.869]  I've got some points I want to add.
[02:50:50.869 --> 02:50:51.390]  Straight ahead.
[02:50:51.390 --> 02:50:52.050]  Get the film.

[02:50:54.251 --> 02:50:56.873]  We'll be back.
[02:50:56.873 --> 02:51:00.656]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[02:51:00.656 --> 02:51:03.918]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[02:51:03.918 --> 02:51:06.720]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:08.861]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[02:51:56.036 --> 02:51:58.379]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[02:51:58.379 --> 02:52:05.008]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them, if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[02:52:05.008 --> 02:52:13.018]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:52:13.519 --> 02:52:18.302]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:52:18.302 --> 02:52:22.445]  One World Whey is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:52:22.445 --> 02:52:30.571]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids and all whey protein powders we've investigated and most proteins you consume are heated.
[02:52:30.571 --> 02:52:34.453]  With our TrueCool™ process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[02:52:34.453 --> 02:52:35.494]  My name is Daniel.
[02:52:35.494 --> 02:52:36.715]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:52:36.715 --> 02:52:39.597]  When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:52:39.597 --> 02:52:39.677]  Now,
[02:52:41.338 --> 02:52:43.639]  After two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:52:43.639 --> 02:52:45.680]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:52.524]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:52:52.524 --> 02:52:55.845]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.

[02:53:57.640 --> 02:54:03.465]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:03.465 --> 02:54:05.767]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:15.589 --> 02:54:17.572]  Joel Skousen's our guest.
[02:54:17.572 --> 02:54:24.942]  You know, I know intellectually what to do, but I also have learned that when the globalists are really pushing something,
[02:54:25.979 --> 02:54:37.328]  If they want open borders, if they want your guns, if they want to break up the family, whatever they're pushing, common sense shows it's bad for everybody, you know to oppose it.
[02:54:37.328 --> 02:54:40.411]  And they want people out of rural areas.
[02:54:40.411 --> 02:54:43.874]  Agenda 21 is all designed to not make you sustainable.
[02:54:43.874 --> 02:54:47.877]  They call it sustainable, it's the opposite of sustainable, under control.
[02:54:47.877 --> 02:54:52.300]  And so regardless of the fact that there's all these bases, the Russians are building big underground bases,
[02:54:53.081 --> 02:54:53.641]  The U.S.
[02:54:53.641 --> 02:54:54.221]  is doing it.
[02:54:54.221 --> 02:54:55.301]  It's just ongoing.
[02:54:55.301 --> 02:54:58.802]  The Chinese general's threatening to nuke us.
[02:54:58.802 --> 02:55:17.946]  My reason to get out in the country and get outside is because we need to totally take over the countryside so they can't force us out and create our own economies, which is happening, of barter and milk and food and organics to create our own cultures and to restore the republic there.
[02:55:17.946 --> 02:55:19.966]  That's the best way to really win is just do it.
[02:55:20.546 --> 02:55:22.427]  I can tell you all over the country it's happening.
[02:55:22.427 --> 02:55:25.529]  I mean, you go out in the Hill Country where I live, almost everybody's anti-New World Order.
[02:55:25.529 --> 02:55:27.611]  They all know what's going on.
[02:55:27.611 --> 02:55:32.574]  The intelligentsia is all running out there who aren't high-level but know what's going on.
[02:55:32.574 --> 02:55:45.942]  And so when Joel talks about this, it isn't just to the safest places like where he lives, and he's got those in the book and in the film, Strategic Relocation, but there's also sub-regions everywhere that aren't perfect, but if you've got to live there to make money, they're better.
[02:55:45.942 --> 02:55:46.683]  And I'm telling you,
[02:55:47.583 --> 02:55:54.892]  Voting with your feet and voting with a lifestyle, and none of us are perfect, is the most powerful thing there is.
[02:55:54.892 --> 02:55:55.773]  Joel, do you agree with that?
[02:55:55.773 --> 02:55:57.475]  Absolutely.
[02:55:57.475 --> 02:56:02.400]  And, you know, the infrastructure with the, you know, organic raw milk movement and the
[02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:07.962]  Foundations that are promoting really good nutrition and organic.
[02:56:07.962 --> 02:56:12.486]  I mean, not just this phony stuff that's sold in the store, but real farm grown family farm.
[02:56:12.486 --> 02:56:14.888]  It's really growing around the nation.
[02:56:14.888 --> 02:56:21.172]  But still, the vast majority of our supporters are in the cities because they're tied there for a job.
[02:56:21.172 --> 02:56:27.297]  And my point is that eventually, you have to believe me, nuclear war is coming to this country.
[02:56:27.297 --> 02:56:29.379]  You will be driven out.
[02:56:29.379 --> 02:56:31.921]  So, do you want to be a refugee?
[02:56:32.708 --> 02:56:40.450]  When it's coming, and I tell my subscribers, I'm going to be warning you when I see this coming, because there will be signs, even though it's intended to be a surprise.
[02:56:40.450 --> 02:56:53.253]  Do you want to be driven out as a refugee, or do you want to make an intelligent decision, a calculated decision, to move early, even if it's some financial sacrifice?
[02:56:53.253 --> 02:56:59.315]  And, you know, you don't necessarily want to go too soon, so that you run out of money and there's no money to sustain yourself.
[02:57:00.703 --> 02:57:03.244]  You know, people have to make a very careful decision.
[02:57:03.244 --> 02:57:07.845]  I keep telling them that it's not a matter of when you're going to move.
[02:57:07.845 --> 02:57:14.726]  I mean, if you're going to move, it's a matter of when you're going to pick the timing to move.
[02:57:14.726 --> 02:57:16.026]  How do you see it breaking down?
[02:57:16.026 --> 02:57:17.567]  I want to do five more minutes in overdrive with you.
[02:57:17.567 --> 02:57:18.587]  How do you see them?
[02:57:18.587 --> 02:57:27.489]  I guess North Korea triggers it and then there's an exchange to attack North Korea and then defense pack of China comes in or Russia.
[02:57:27.489 --> 02:57:28.529]  How do you see that unfolding?
[02:57:29.039 --> 02:57:30.620]  Here's what I see happening.
[02:57:30.620 --> 02:57:37.644]  North Korea will trigger the war by a massive attack on Seoul and other armed installations on the border and on U.S.
[02:57:37.644 --> 02:57:38.245]  installations.
[02:57:38.245 --> 02:57:44.208]  They will retaliate with tactical nukes to stop the North Korean advance.
[02:57:44.208 --> 02:57:49.252]  Russia and China will then enter the war with a preemptive EMP strike first.
[02:57:49.252 --> 02:57:54.655]  It takes about six missiles, high-altitude missiles, six weapons to cover and blanket the U.S.
[02:57:56.167 --> 02:58:05.650]  Then that'll be followed by 20 or 30 minutes later by a physical attack on military and communications facilities worldwide on American and perhaps British.
[02:58:05.650 --> 02:58:10.192]  They hope to then call a truce and just blackmail everyone.
[02:58:12.130 --> 02:58:12.550]  Stay there.
[02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:13.631]  We gotta go to break, Joel.
[02:58:13.631 --> 02:58:15.312]  Come back in five minutes and break down the rest of it.
[02:58:15.312 --> 02:58:16.313]  We'll have you back very soon.
[02:58:16.313 --> 02:58:17.874]  And I'm gonna mail him a headset.
[02:58:17.874 --> 02:58:19.716]  He got an external mic, but still not the best audio.
[02:58:19.716 --> 02:58:21.177]  I'm gonna have Joel on regularly.
[02:58:21.177 --> 02:58:24.399]  We're gonna get him a high-quality headset because his info is powerful.
[02:58:24.399 --> 02:58:27.161]  People really loved it when he came to town last year.
[02:58:27.161 --> 02:58:28.602]  We're bringing him back to town.
[02:58:28.602 --> 02:58:30.323]  Get the book, Strategic Relocation.

[03:00:06.703 --> 03:00:10.886]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:10.886 --> 03:00:15.189]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.189 --> 03:00:25.317]  Alright, final segment with Joel Scalzen, then we go into retransmission, and I know we do have calls for our guests, we'll see if we can get to those.
[03:00:27.492 --> 03:00:28.613]  Going back to Joel Skousen.
[03:00:28.613 --> 03:00:37.383]  Okay, so you were getting into, for those that just joined us, North Korea being given the order to trigger a nuclear war.
[03:00:37.383 --> 03:00:38.264]  What's the time frame?
[03:00:38.264 --> 03:00:40.006]  Five, ten years?
[03:00:40.006 --> 03:00:44.430]  And then finish up with where you'd gotten up to.
[03:00:44.430 --> 03:00:44.691]  Go ahead.
[03:00:45.691 --> 03:00:50.134]  Yeah, I think the time frame is probably anywhere from 5 to 10 years.
[03:00:50.134 --> 03:00:52.495]  It could be 8 to 12, just depends.
[03:00:52.495 --> 03:00:55.778]  You see, the Russians and Chinese are scared to death about U.S.
[03:00:55.778 --> 03:00:59.940]  secret weapons systems that they haven't been able to find out.
[03:00:59.940 --> 03:01:00.721]  The U.S.
[03:01:00.721 --> 03:01:04.824]  has to continue to disarm to try to give them the confidence to strike.
[03:01:04.824 --> 03:01:08.406]  They've been expecting a strike since the 90s that hasn't come yet.
[03:01:08.993 --> 03:01:19.495]  But I think after the strike occurs, there'll be a stand-down and Russian China will essentially try to get the New World Order or the globalists to yield to avoid further destruction.
[03:01:20.254 --> 03:01:20.975]  And they will not.
[03:01:20.975 --> 03:01:29.901]  They'll come out of their bunkers and they'll rally everyone to fight against them and they'll bring out these secret weapons to prosecute the war, not on behalf of the U.S.
[03:01:29.901 --> 03:01:30.942]  It won't be the U.S.
[03:01:30.942 --> 03:01:31.883]  running the show anymore.
[03:01:31.883 --> 03:01:34.365]  It'll be a militarized League of Democracies.
[03:01:34.365 --> 03:01:35.766]  They'll change the name of the U.N.
[03:01:35.766 --> 03:01:37.987]  and exclude finally, as they should have always done.
[03:01:37.987 --> 03:01:39.849]  And they know the way Western cultures be.
[03:01:39.849 --> 03:01:42.351]  It'll just be absolutely vicious total takeover.
[03:01:43.510 --> 03:01:51.996]  That's right, and what's going to happen is that they will make a deal during this, as they prosecute this war against the Russians, who will invade Europe.
[03:01:51.996 --> 03:01:59.541]  Europe's going to be a real Donnybrook, and they'll make a deal during the war with China to betray Russia.
[03:01:59.541 --> 03:02:04.464]  That's the only way the New World Order's going to win against Russia and China, to have China betray.
[03:02:04.464 --> 03:02:08.547]  China wants to take Russia out anyway someday, so they'll take advantage to remove Russia.
[03:02:08.547 --> 03:02:09.348]  They'll be defeated.
[03:02:10.194 --> 03:02:15.856]  And this is a replay to a certain extent of what happened between Hitler and Stalin.
[03:02:15.856 --> 03:02:17.057]  And Hitler was eliminated.
[03:02:17.057 --> 03:02:19.358]  Now it's Russia's turn to be eliminated.
[03:02:19.358 --> 03:02:22.459]  And then it's going to be a new Cold War after that.
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:33.345]  Where they'll settle on, and the militarized new world order wants China as a Cold War enemy because then they have an excuse not to disarm.
[03:02:33.345 --> 03:02:36.126]  Yeah, a new false bipolar world.
[03:02:36.126 --> 03:02:36.566]  That's right.
[03:02:36.566 --> 03:02:38.187]  It goes to a bipolar world.
[03:02:38.187 --> 03:02:43.009]  The global government can say, we can't go back to national sovereignty.
[03:02:43.009 --> 03:02:43.549]  The U.S.
[03:02:43.549 --> 03:02:45.190]  will never be strong enough.
[03:02:45.190 --> 03:02:49.092]  We have to stay as a militarized world order, and that's where it's going to stay.
[03:02:49.092 --> 03:02:51.873]  Unlike World War II, we will never get our liberty back.
[03:02:52.453 --> 03:03:02.635]  But in my estimation, when they lose a certain amount of control during this war, and they will lose a lot of control with the EMP strike, a lot of the computers will be down.
[03:03:02.635 --> 03:03:07.456]  I'm hoping the Utah Computer Center will be destroyed as one of the nuclear targets.
[03:03:07.456 --> 03:03:18.298]  But in any case, it's going to give conservatives, the minority in the country, a new lease on life, ability to coalesce together, and you're going to find that the Texas groups that coalesce
[03:03:18.959 --> 03:03:29.857]  We'll eventually merge and join with the Utah, the Idaho, the Wyoming, Montana, Arizona groups and we're going to have a Western resistance to the New World Order that they will not be able to control.
[03:03:29.857 --> 03:03:32.442]  And I see that as our major hope.
[03:03:33.306 --> 03:03:41.309]  Not spinning our wheels, trying to twist arms with people who don't want to join us, who don't have any feeling for liberty.
[03:03:41.309 --> 03:03:43.130]  The new benefit-corrupted majority.
[03:03:43.130 --> 03:03:50.392]  We're going to have to consolidate our own people, husband our forces, get people prepared so they survive this war.
[03:03:50.392 --> 03:03:51.532]  I mean, that's the big thing.
[03:03:51.532 --> 03:03:55.534]  You've got to get out of these targeted cities that I list in strategic relocation.
[03:03:56.235 --> 03:04:10.642]  Even if you can't afford a retreat, you've at least got to get to safe areas so that you don't get killed and make plans to survive more so that we can live again to rebuild under a true constitutional republic.
[03:04:12.779 --> 03:04:14.300]  Well, it's certainly a possibility.
[03:04:14.300 --> 03:04:28.313]  You look with Cheney and 888, where they tried to start a war with Russia and all the stuff, everything they do, putting all the Muslim extremists in, and they, I mean, they are trying to sow total chaos.
[03:04:28.313 --> 03:04:31.115]  Well, it's got to be controlled chaos that they can control.
[03:04:31.115 --> 03:04:32.917]  They really don't want chaos for chaos' sake.
[03:04:33.755 --> 03:04:35.176]  Sure, order out of chaos.
[03:04:35.176 --> 03:04:37.277]  All right, Joel Skousen, we'll talk to you again soon.
[03:04:37.277 --> 03:04:43.039]  And I want to talk to you with the producers about next time you want to come to Austin to be in studio.
[03:04:43.039 --> 03:04:46.481]  Get the book, get the film, Strategic Relocation, infallwarstore.com.
[03:04:46.481 --> 03:04:47.882]  Thank you so much, Joel.
[03:04:47.882 --> 03:04:49.122]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:49.122 --> 03:04:52.304]  You can find him at World Affairs Brief as well on his website.
[03:04:52.304 --> 03:04:52.504]  All right.
