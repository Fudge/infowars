[00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.025]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:14.716]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:16.417]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.157 --> 00:00:18.298]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:19.738]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:21.419]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:30.362]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:42.467]  I've probably started 500 radio broadcasts the way I'm about to start this one.
[00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:46.132]  Trying to contain myself.
[00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:51.393]  Trying to make sure I go over coldly all the incredible evidence.
[00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:56.995]  This is truly a day where we're seeing the best of humanity and the worst of humanity.
[00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:02.677]  Only 9% of Americans in a major poll
[00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:08.781]  ...are agreeing to an attack on Syria.
[00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:09.922]  This is unprecedented.
[00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:11.744]  This shows the dam has broken.
[00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:13.266]  The people are aware of the fraud.
[00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:15.189]  They're aware of the war provocation.
[00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:23.119]  Every military person I talk to, active duty and retired, all the way up to generals, some of them off record, some of them on record,
[00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:31.018]  are absolutely against this and know that the Syrian rebels, the Al-Qaeda forces, are behind the attacks.
[00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.840]  They've been caught three separate times.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.842]  There's no logic for Assad to do this.
[00:01:35.182 --> 00:01:38.705]  The area where it happened was rebel-held and they targeted civilians.
[00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:44.190]  And then you watch John Kerry up there pushing his lies.
[00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:47.493]  This is unbelievable.
[00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:50.917]  But what it illustrates is we have a political class dictatorship
[00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.613]  A bureaucratic, corporate, mega-globalist dictatorship that doesn't care.
[00:01:56.893 --> 00:02:04.480]  And they're now in NBC News, Associated Press, Reuters, you name it, announcing the military strikes as early as Thursday.
[00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:08.443]  That's military strikes, heavy strikes.
[00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:11.926]  Aircraft are massing in Cyprus, 100 miles away.
[00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:12.887]  F-16s, F-18s, F-15s.
[00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:22.520]  Puff the Magic Dragon, C-130 gunships, just you name it.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.023]  They've even had B-2 bombers taking off out of the U.S.
[00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:28.303]  and reportedly flying to Europe.
[00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:30.725]  That's where one of them crash-landed a few weeks ago.
[00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:34.447]  There is just all sorts of stuff going on right now.
[00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:36.708]  They're not just gearing up to hit Syria.
[00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:41.643]  They're not just gearing up to hit Syria, folks.
[00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:43.264]  They intend to get in a fight with the Russians.
[00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:47.548]  And the Russians have got anti-aircraft missiles that are the latest generation.
[00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:50.250]  They've got anti-ship missiles that are the latest generation.
[00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.872]  And let me tell you, when you see U.S.
[00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:54.634]  ships sinking and on fire, and when you see U.S.
[00:02:54.714 --> 00:03:00.960]  aircraft getting shot down, the average good old boy is going to get behind Obama, kneel to him, and turn his guns in, basically.
[00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.613]  I mean, they know that because they'll just get behind the military whenever they see U.S.
[00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:07.354]  ships blowing up.
[00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:09.655]  They may even false flag our ships.
[00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:10.756]  That got declassified.
[00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:16.940]  Well, Cy Hirsch had sources inside, later they had to admit it, what, four years ago, that Cheney wanted to attack U.S.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.043]  ships in the Strait of Hormuz and blame it on Iran, but Bush said no and stopped him.
[00:03:23.063 --> 00:03:25.505]  One of the few times he said, I'm the president, you're not going to do that.
[00:03:26.817 --> 00:03:30.179]  Because Bush reportedly had some little soft spot for the Navy SEALs they were going to kill.
[00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.340]  I mean, that all came out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:36.361]  That all came out.
[00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:42.104]  And it is in the BBC that Western aircraft are arriving in Cyprus.
[00:03:42.124 --> 00:03:43.485]  Zero Edge is also carrying it.
[00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.446]  It's all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:47.107 --> 00:03:51.489]  And the leader of Al-Qaeda, Zawahiri, this is CNS News,
[00:03:52.526 --> 00:03:54.447]  Has gone public backing the U.S.
[00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:54.867]  attack.
[00:03:55.227 --> 00:03:56.447]  He's very, very thankful for that.
[00:03:57.568 --> 00:04:06.011]  And saying, after they've already taken out Libya, he says, after Syria, then Damascus, the capital of Syria, then Cairo, then Jerusalem.
[00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.011]  Absolutely.
[00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:11.253]  And Obama and our government is on record supporting that takeover.
[00:04:13.094 --> 00:04:14.715]  Now here's the mega bombshell.
[00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:21.159]  This story is up on Infowars.com right now with all the videos added to it.
[00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.262]  It's from WorldNetDaily and we've got Dr. Corsi joining us at the start of the second hour.
[00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:37.348]  Paul found this a year ago when they first attacked them loading the missiles with the nerve gas and because the Al-Qaeda rebels posted they're proud of themselves.
[00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:38.889]  They know how dumb Americans are on average.
[00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:45.287]  There are new videos of last week's attack with the jihadis loading the chemical mortars.
[00:04:45.307 --> 00:04:49.991]  And I told you it'd be chemical mortars, because that's how you precisely hit a civilian area.
[00:04:50.772 --> 00:04:52.213]  And then blame the opposition.
[00:04:52.473 --> 00:04:58.618]  We have the video, they posted it, that's how arrogant they are of them launching the chemical attack.
[00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.120]  And you know who's commanding them, John Kerry.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.845]  So when he gets up and gives a speech about invading, he's the prime suspect of the nerve gas attack.
[00:05:09.782 --> 00:05:20.928]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.

[00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:12.912]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[00:06:13.132 --> 00:06:19.175]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[00:06:19.515 --> 00:06:25.938]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:06:26.318 --> 00:06:28.279]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:29.660]  They're the good guys.

[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.222]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:07:12.242 --> 00:07:19.851]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:24.936]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:07:25.217 --> 00:07:27.139]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:28.921]  If every one of us who can...
[00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:30.502]  We'll take care of ourselves.
[00:07:30.762 --> 00:07:33.505]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:41.592]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[00:07:41.993 --> 00:07:48.318]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:50.221]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[00:08:19.764 --> 00:08:23.250]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:25.714]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.217 --> 00:08:29.260]  My friends, it looks like they're going to do it.
[00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:31.720]  They're really going to do it.
[00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:45.330]  And it conjures up an image of Charlton Heston at the end of The Planet of the Apes, discovering that the planet he's on is not some far-off planetoid orbiting a distant sun, but is Earth.
[00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:51.254]  When he sees the Statue of Liberty half-submerged in the ocean, melted from nuclear fire.
[00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:54.016]  Thermonuclear explosion.
[00:08:54.557 --> 00:08:55.758]  He says, they did it.
[00:08:55.878 --> 00:08:57.379]  They really did it.
[00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:00.350]  And that's the point we stand at here.
[00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.852]  I don't say this for rhetoric or to hype up the radio listeners.
[00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:11.456]  I am more concerned for my family and this country and the world than I have ever been.
[00:09:12.297 --> 00:09:16.099]  You know the globalists aren't going to let Obama just leave office in two and a half years.
[00:09:17.264 --> 00:09:28.472]  They haven't set up Homeland Security, the armored vehicles, the billions of bullets, and the spy grids, and gone public bad-mouthing the Founding Fathers, and the Department of Defense manuals that are public, the Judicial Watch is covering.
[00:09:28.793 --> 00:09:34.317]  They haven't tried to overthrow the country and shut down our power plants and ship our jobs to China for nothing.
[00:09:34.837 --> 00:09:36.078]  They're going for broke.
[00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:43.664]  And they need a big war to get the American people to shut up and go along with it.
[00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:49.413]  There is a Russian fleet off the coast of Syria.
[00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:53.036]  The Guardian confirms with Zero Hedges reporting.
[00:09:54.317 --> 00:09:57.479]  You can look at the links on InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com right now.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.000]  That U.S.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:10.449]  aircraft, British aircraft, French aircraft, NATO forces, F-16s, F-18s, you name it, German aircraft, they're all massing there.
[00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:12.491]  Tornadoes, the list goes on and on.
[00:10:13.451 --> 00:10:15.732]  And they are moving in strategic bombers.
[00:10:16.812 --> 00:10:18.593]  I know because they've left West Texas.
[00:10:19.813 --> 00:10:22.474]  They're gearing up for war with Russia, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:23.294 --> 00:10:29.456]  They're just going to use Syria as the detonator for this situation.
[00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:32.537]  There's the London Guardian.
[00:10:32.597 --> 00:10:33.497]  Syrian crisis.
[00:10:33.537 --> 00:10:37.018]  Warplanes spotted in Cyprus as tensions rise in Damascus.
[00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:43.168]  NBC News reports military strikes on Syria as early as Thursday.
[00:10:43.328 --> 00:10:43.609]  U.S.
[00:10:43.989 --> 00:10:48.212]  officials say it is on, ladies and gentlemen, right now.
[00:10:49.273 --> 00:11:01.542]  The Russian deputy premier calls the West a monkey with a hand grenade, and that's an old saying from World War I, because a monkey has no idea that it's holding absolute death in its hand.
[00:11:03.484 --> 00:11:04.825]  World War III, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:06.564 --> 00:11:14.430]  You know, I liken it to a five-year-old who is playing Monopoly with you and you catch them cheating.
[00:11:17.592 --> 00:11:23.977]  And, except in this case, innocents die and Park Place gets bombed, basically.
[00:11:24.678 --> 00:11:36.307]  And it is psychopathic, inbred, globalist royalty and bankers who make forty-to-one bets with other people's money and get in trouble only by being slapped on the wrist and given more taxpayer money.
[00:11:37.338 --> 00:11:46.504]  And they're accustomed to never failing, and they've got over 10,000 nuclear weapons in the U.S., more than 20,000 in Europe and England.
[00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:54.189]  Israel's got more than 600, and it's got Dolphin submarines with cruise missiles aimed at Russia, saying they'll use them.
[00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:59.893]  The Israeli Knesset, even this year, had members say, let Russia back Syria, we'll just blow them off the map.
[00:12:00.253 --> 00:12:03.556]  I mean, this is crazy land, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:04.537 --> 00:12:08.798]  This is a monkey with a thermonuclear stockpile.
[00:12:09.319 --> 00:12:12.740]  This is worse than a monkey with a hand grenade, because then the monkey just blows themselves up.
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.102]  And it's just like Hitler turning east into Russia when he was already losing with the West.
[00:12:19.122 --> 00:12:21.583]  It's just like Napoleon going into Russia.
[00:12:22.363 --> 00:12:24.704]  Empires go into Russia to die, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:25.824 --> 00:12:30.105]  And the Russians have shown historically that they will not blink when it comes time.
[00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.546]  They're going to fire nuclear weapons.
[00:12:32.677 --> 00:12:36.579]  Now, they already tried to have nuclear war in 1962 and 63.
[00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:39.500]  Kennedy said no, and the CIA blew his head off.
[00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:41.681]  I don't romanticize Kennedy.
[00:12:41.721 --> 00:12:42.742]  He did a lot of bad stuff.
[00:12:43.082 --> 00:12:45.103]  They were getting ready to stage a false flag on Honduras.
[00:12:45.143 --> 00:12:47.164]  That's been declassified to blow up the U.S.
[00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:48.404]  Embassy to have a war down there.
[00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:52.126]  But Kennedy, this came out.
[00:12:52.226 --> 00:12:54.307]  Curtis LeMay, the head of the Air Force, wanted to nuke Russia.
[00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.071]  If you see the movie Dr. Strangelove from 1964, that was made during that whole deal.
[00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:10.135]  And Kubrick, it's now been declassified, was given info by the Kennedy administration in 62 and 63, when they didn't think they'd be dead yet, as a way to counter them.
[00:13:10.676 --> 00:13:12.196]  And of course, Kennedy then fired them all.
[00:13:12.616 --> 00:13:12.876]  L.L.
[00:13:12.916 --> 00:13:18.579]  Lemnitzer, Curtis LeMay, the Dulles brothers running the CIA.
[00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:20.659]  He said, we're not going to have nuclear war.
[00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:22.240]  And he called Khrushchev up.
[00:13:23.615 --> 00:13:26.937]  And said, look bud, you back off right now, they're gonna nuke you.
[00:13:27.997 --> 00:13:33.480]  And because he got that real phone call, the Russians stood down, pulled their missiles out of Cuba, and the U.S.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.361]  pulled their missiles out of Turkey.
[00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.763]  The Russians put the missiles in Cuba because the U.S.
[00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:40.664]  put missiles in Turkey.
[00:13:41.304 --> 00:13:43.806]  Believe me, I know, I had family over there that was deploying them.
[00:13:43.826 --> 00:13:46.887]  I remember hearing about that when I was a kid, you know, after it had happened.
[00:13:47.648 --> 00:13:49.789]  But back when I was a kid, it was just a few years after it had happened.
[00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:55.298]  Okay, this time you got a bunch of nutcases running the federal government, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:57.659]  There isn't a John F. Kennedy up there to stop this.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.883]  And yes, the West has superior space weapons, DU, meteor guns, SABOs, all sorts of stuff.
[00:14:03.923 --> 00:14:04.743]  It still won't matter.
[00:14:04.943 --> 00:14:06.944]  They won't be able to shoot down all the Russian missiles.
[00:14:08.985 --> 00:14:11.967]  Now, Dick Cheney, on 888 back in 2008, had their Western puppet,
[00:14:17.512 --> 00:14:24.351]  Launch an attack into Russian-held areas, attack Russian bases on the border in Ossetia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[00:14:25.544 --> 00:14:27.606]  And our media said Russia has attacked Georgia.
[00:14:27.626 --> 00:14:30.608]  It came out three days later that no, actually the West attacked Russia.
[00:14:30.768 --> 00:14:32.229]  People said, how dare you side with Russia?
[00:14:32.609 --> 00:14:37.133]  Folks, I am an American, a constitutionalist, a defender of the whole Bill of Rights.
[00:14:37.373 --> 00:14:40.556]  We've been seized by crazy bankers that aren't even in the U.S.
[00:14:40.596 --> 00:14:40.976]  mainly.
[00:14:41.216 --> 00:14:42.877]  They've all moved to Luxembourg.
[00:14:42.917 --> 00:14:48.522]  And by the way, all the top Israeli billionaires, all of them the last two years, have moved out of Israel.
[00:14:48.562 --> 00:14:49.562]  Guys, type in those headlines.
[00:14:49.582 --> 00:14:51.444]  All the dots are connecting right now.
[00:14:51.744 --> 00:14:53.264]  Even for me on air as we break this down.
[00:14:53.704 --> 00:14:55.405]  Just type in billionaires leaving Israel.
[00:14:56.065 --> 00:14:57.785]  And they're going to Australia, folks.
[00:14:58.346 --> 00:14:59.306]  They're going to London.
[00:15:00.206 --> 00:15:02.527]  They're going to Paraguay.
[00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:04.687]  The Israeli billionaires are leaving.
[00:15:05.047 --> 00:15:06.468]  The American billionaires are leaving.
[00:15:06.588 --> 00:15:10.529]  I personally know one of the richest women in America.
[00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:11.549]  She's no longer in America.
[00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:14.229]  I only ran into her by happenstance as she was a listener.
[00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:15.370]  I didn't even know who she was.
[00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.670]  I looked her up and she told the truth.
[00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.091]  One of the richest defense contractor women in the world.
[00:15:20.971 --> 00:15:22.271]  She left five years ago.
[00:15:22.511 --> 00:15:25.092]  She said, quote, there will not be a United States.
[00:15:25.112 --> 00:15:26.433]  I said, what are you talking about?
[00:15:26.453 --> 00:15:30.174]  She said, look, you're going to get real big because everything you're saying is true.
[00:15:30.534 --> 00:15:32.994]  But you better get your family out of here within five years.
[00:15:33.355 --> 00:15:34.155]  It's five years later.
[00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:35.615]  I've told you that story for five years.
[00:15:35.915 --> 00:15:37.636]  Put the headline back up there for everybody.
[00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:40.777]  These crazy people are going to start World War Three.
[00:15:41.777 --> 00:15:42.517]  Guys found the headlines.
[00:15:42.537 --> 00:15:48.479]  I want to read people out of Leningradian about the Israeli billionaires leaving because they know Israel is probably going to get hit in all this.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.305]  Israeli billionaire, Adon offers moving to London.
[00:15:53.365 --> 00:15:54.246]  No loss to us.
[00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:55.748]  Bye bye, Adon.
[00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:58.913]  Your move won't impact Israel's economy.
[00:15:58.953 --> 00:15:59.393]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:15:59.413 --> 00:16:01.516]  I mean, that's just some, I guess, Israeli paper.
[00:16:01.536 --> 00:16:02.999]  What is that, Haratz or Jerusalem Post?
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.340]  Yes, Haratz.
[00:16:05.489 --> 00:16:07.650]  They've all been leaving, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:08.851]  Okay?
[00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:10.132]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:16:10.172 --> 00:16:12.073]  The globalists want to bring in world government.
[00:16:12.353 --> 00:16:23.180]  And they have declassified that they staged World War I and suckered the Austrian-Hungarian Empire into that war, Germany into that war, to bring in the League of Nations.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.061]  And then they engineered World War II.
[00:16:25.361 --> 00:16:26.802]  The globalists funding all sides.
[00:16:28.427 --> 00:16:33.570]  To bring in the UN, and now the final world war that Albert Pike wrote about in 1878.
[00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.972]  The head of the Illuminati, look it up.
[00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:39.614]  His letter in the Royal College in London.
[00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:41.235]  Royal Naval College.
[00:16:41.475 --> 00:16:41.996]  I've been there.
[00:16:43.156 --> 00:16:48.299]  Ladies and gentlemen, he said they'd have a final world war to bring in the Antichrist.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:56.885]  Now, whether you believe in God or not, these people do, and they're doing it, and they believe out of this giant war that they're trying to set up.
[00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:01.234]  They pray to bring in the Antichrist.
[00:17:01.374 --> 00:17:04.437]  Now, I'm just telling you what the globalists think.
[00:17:04.817 --> 00:17:06.298]  They call him their Christ.
[00:17:06.398 --> 00:17:07.459]  I call it the Antichrist.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.942]  By the way, this is so bombshell, I can't even believe it.
[00:17:12.404 --> 00:17:16.127]  Up on InfoWars.com, we're linked to the WorldNetDaily article with all the videos.
[00:17:16.187 --> 00:17:20.331]  And I remember Watson, a year ago, with nerve gas attacks, showing the rebels bragging they'd done it.
[00:17:21.192 --> 00:17:29.385]  WorldNetDaily found all the Al-Qaeda videos from all of their Egyptian and Israeli sources, because there are a bunch of cooler heads in Egypt and Israel that don't want this to happen.
[00:17:29.605 --> 00:17:31.889]  By the way, most people in Israel aren't for this either.
[00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.132]  And large parts of the Knesset aren't as well.
[00:17:34.152 --> 00:17:35.995]  It doesn't matter though, large parts are for it.
[00:17:36.781 --> 00:17:40.222]  And so through their contacts, and Arab speakers, they have that work at WorldNet daily.
[00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:41.903]  What an incredible team they have, folks.
[00:17:41.923 --> 00:17:43.003]  I've been to their offices in D.C.
[00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:43.703]  and it's amazing.
[00:17:44.344 --> 00:17:53.287]  They were able to go find all the videos put out last week where the rebels, in fact, show the article and scroll down, and one of the videos, it's a still shot of them loading
[00:17:54.887 --> 00:17:56.048]  And it's the Al-Qaeda rebels.
[00:17:56.648 --> 00:18:01.289]  Remember last year, earlier this year, when the Israelis bombed it so they wouldn't get it?
[00:18:01.429 --> 00:18:04.470]  Al-Qaeda got into that chemical base and reportedly stole some.
[00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:16.054]  There is Al-Qaeda in their own videos, in their own brigade websites, loading the chemical mortars onto the mortars and firing them and bragging they did it.
[00:18:17.334 --> 00:18:19.675]  I mean, this is unbelievable!
[00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:21.436]  And then John Kerry,
[00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:26.016]  Gets up there yesterday and says, anybody that questions this is aiding the terrorists.
[00:18:26.717 --> 00:18:30.721]  And we don't even know, he goes on to say, who did the chemical, it doesn't matter.
[00:18:31.121 --> 00:18:36.727]  That's a quote, and even the Wall Street Journal today says that, has the quote going, well, does it matter who did it?
[00:18:37.508 --> 00:18:43.514]  If the UN finds chemical residue, they bomb the whole country and go in and turn it over to Al Qaeda.
[00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:50.831]  I mean, they don't even care that we all know, because once they start a giant war, they think you'll get behind it.
[00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:52.472]  But let me tell The Globalist something right now.
[00:18:54.453 --> 00:19:03.836]  I have Pew Research here with a 10-year graph from the 2003 start of the Iraq War until now.
[00:19:03.916 --> 00:19:04.917]  Document cam, please.
[00:19:05.837 --> 00:19:08.978]  It started, when the war started, with a 72% approval rating.
[00:19:13.956 --> 00:19:20.199]  And the last time they did a poll, it had a 38% approval rating, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:21.720]  Okay?
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.362]  And this Pew Research went from 2003 to 2008, doesn't go past that.
[00:19:25.682 --> 00:19:28.584]  So within those five, six year period, it plunged more than half.
[00:19:28.724 --> 00:19:29.004]  Okay.
[00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:30.485]  There's that.
[00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:38.309]  Now, let me show you the new poll, Syria intervention even less popular than Congress.
[00:19:39.449 --> 00:19:44.432]  A Reuters poll, scientific, only 9% support it.
[00:19:44.732 --> 00:19:46.594]  And there's another real clear politics poll.
[00:19:47.614 --> 00:19:49.455]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's the deal, globalists.
[00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:51.877]  Everybody knows you're running the chemical attacks.
[00:19:52.077 --> 00:19:54.038]  By the way, do you know why I got so sick and so angry?
[00:19:54.298 --> 00:19:55.719]  I actually had a fit yesterday up here.
[00:19:55.739 --> 00:20:01.423]  I mean, I was yelling and running and screaming for about a minute and a half because I realized
[00:20:02.637 --> 00:20:05.900]  Why I was getting so angry when I'm looking at John Kerry talking about these dead kids?
[00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:07.622]  The State Department's the one running this.
[00:20:07.862 --> 00:20:09.064]  He ordered the chemical attack.
[00:20:09.704 --> 00:20:14.569]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.251]  What are bitcoins?
[00:20:16.692 --> 00:20:22.718]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:20:23.178 --> 00:20:24.599]  No bank needed.
[00:20:24.999 --> 00:20:30.281]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:20:30.681 --> 00:20:32.481]  You are in control of your money.
[00:20:32.942 --> 00:20:33.722]  And the best part?
[00:20:34.102 --> 00:20:37.343]  You can start earning and making money with Bitcoins right away.
[00:20:37.723 --> 00:20:45.126]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with Bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept Bitcoins.

[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:17.965]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:18.005 --> 00:22:18.745]  This capitalism?
[00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:24.929]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:28.611]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:23:41.832 --> 00:23:56.555]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:23:56.715 --> 00:23:58.195]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:23:58.215 --> 00:23:59.816]  And I want to do what we did yesterday.
[00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:01.216]  I want to give the number out again.
[00:24:26.877 --> 00:24:41.680]  For active duty military, especially if you've been over in Iraq, they're on record arming the Al-Qaeda rebels to send them in by the hundreds of thousands in the last two and a half years, or if you've been at the bases in Jordan, where two months ago the U.S.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:47.101]  military had a drill and wouldn't leave Jordan, and the Jordanian government said, leave, and our troops should sit there.
[00:24:47.701 --> 00:24:47.801]  U.S.
[00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:49.841]  troops have entered into the Gaza area.
[00:24:49.861 --> 00:24:52.362]  I mean, all of this is being pre-deployed.
[00:24:53.908 --> 00:24:59.974]  And then, the West says a year ago, if there's any chemical attacks, period, that's a red line we're going to attack.
[00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:02.376]  Thinking Americans are simple-minded.
[00:25:02.716 --> 00:25:07.661]  And then on the date that Obama said that, that's how these gangsters operate, they have Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:07.901 --> 00:25:12.945]  World Net Daily folks, Dr. Jerome Corsi, who worked in all sorts of black ops.
[00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:17.550]  Harvard political science guy, State Department, I mean, you know, give me a break.
[00:25:18.687 --> 00:25:21.689]  I mean, he's a major, major, major spook.
[00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:30.514]  And he's saying that the rebels launched the chemical attack, and they have the videos, and they're Arab sources.
[00:25:30.874 --> 00:25:31.714]  Of course they did!
[00:25:32.135 --> 00:25:35.336]  They did the last three events, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:35.877 --> 00:25:43.181]  And the fact that you got somebody like Corsi, who's a heavy hitter, with all the big connections, worked at international banking, you name it.
[00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.793]  Coming out and saying exactly what we're saying and what Russia's saying.
[00:25:48.133 --> 00:25:50.255]  It's because it's the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:52.497 --> 00:25:56.060]  And they're gonna put Assad up there and go, look, he has a mustache.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.242]  He has brown skin a little bit.
[00:25:58.822 --> 00:26:00.023]  You know, he has brown hair.
[00:26:00.043 --> 00:26:03.126]  You know, he's bad, he's a bad man.
[00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:06.048]  We better get him, he hurt the children.
[00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:07.990]  While Assad's going, I didn't do this!
[00:26:08.591 --> 00:26:10.392]  Don't attack us, the Russians are gonna defend!
[00:26:10.432 --> 00:26:12.314]  I would never use nerve gas, you know that!
[00:26:13.482 --> 00:26:15.083]  You know, you guys have an evil government!
[00:26:15.103 --> 00:26:16.685]  Americans, please don't let your government do this!
[00:26:16.965 --> 00:26:18.826]  They've been attacking us for two and a half years!
[00:26:19.067 --> 00:26:20.348]  Al Qaeda is murdering us!
[00:26:20.368 --> 00:26:21.529]  They're blowing up our churches!
[00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:23.230]  Please, Americans, please!
[00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:36.621]  And the good news is, the American people, in a major Reuters poll, and then there's two others, are between 9 and 12 percent supporting this.
[00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.903]  Ladies and gentlemen, they had 72 percent in
[00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:45.293]  The major polls, some of them even higher, at the start of the last big staged war.
[00:26:45.814 --> 00:26:51.825]  Bill Clinton had over 70% support as well, bombing Belgrade, blowing up the Serb infrastructure.
[00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:53.688]  Turned out that was all made up as well.
[00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:59.326]  That was the Western Civil War, where they funded jihadis out of Albania, Al-Qaeda again to attack.
[00:26:59.566 --> 00:27:01.849]  The Serbs defended themselves, of course, did some atrocities.
[00:27:02.249 --> 00:27:03.070]  Both sides were doing it.
[00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.733]  And then the West went in and absolutely blew the daylights out of them.
[00:27:06.073 --> 00:27:10.738]  The point is, the West, the bankers come, they inject people into your country, stir stuff up.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.642]  They sent in the Croats from one side.
[00:27:15.182 --> 00:27:18.364]  They sent in the Muslims from the other against the Serbs.
[00:27:18.424 --> 00:27:20.085]  The Serbs defended themselves, defeated it.
[00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:35.015]  Even the UN's own commission, you can look this up, said there were twice as many people killed in atrocities and war crimes against citizens by the Croats and the Muslims, double-teaming the Serbs, than were killed by the Muslims and the Croats.
[00:27:35.035 --> 00:27:36.116]  And I've had a few Croat
[00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:40.999]  And Muslim taxi drivers in New York and once in Austin and once in Dallas.
[00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:42.240]  This happened three times.
[00:27:42.641 --> 00:27:43.802]  Say, you are Alex Jones!
[00:27:44.222 --> 00:27:45.103]  We love Bill Clinton!
[00:27:46.244 --> 00:27:47.224]  You side with Serbs.
[00:27:47.304 --> 00:27:47.944]  I don't like you.
[00:27:47.964 --> 00:27:49.785]  I'm like, well, you want me to get out?
[00:27:49.825 --> 00:27:49.945]  No.
[00:27:49.965 --> 00:27:50.665]  But you do not know.
[00:27:50.705 --> 00:27:53.705]  And I go, well, didn't you guys attack them first and kill double their number?
[00:27:53.945 --> 00:27:54.686]  Yes, they are evil.
[00:27:54.726 --> 00:27:55.906]  We will kill all Serbs.
[00:27:56.506 --> 00:27:58.106]  Why are you with the pig Serbs?
[00:27:59.026 --> 00:28:00.206]  And I'm like, I'm not.
[00:28:00.687 --> 00:28:03.147]  I don't even have any Slavic blood in me, but I'd be proud if I did.
[00:28:03.587 --> 00:28:05.727]  I'd be proud if I had your blood in me.
[00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:09.508]  The point is, the West started all this to get rid of a sovereign area.
[00:28:10.568 --> 00:28:13.129]  Well, OK, but to us, Bill Clinton is God.
[00:28:13.349 --> 00:28:14.649]  That was the conversation in New York.
[00:28:16.004 --> 00:28:24.730]  Back in 2004, I was there for the RNC, and this guy, I was in the back, Kevin Booth was right next to me, and this guy would just look at me in the rear-view mirror, and he looked like a pure white guy.
[00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.971]  He had, like, blonde hair, blue eyes.
[00:28:25.991 --> 00:28:26.612]  He was a Muslim.
[00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.033]  And he was just, like, just...
[00:28:31.388 --> 00:28:34.969]  I used to like you, but you do support the pig CERB.
[00:28:35.069 --> 00:28:41.231]  I mean, it's just like, man, I don't support NATO and the New World Order sending people into some country to attack them.
[00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:43.432]  They defend themselves and then they're called terrorists.
[00:28:43.672 --> 00:28:49.194]  And then the West blows up all their chemical plants, all their power plants, bombs Belgrade with depleted uranium.
[00:28:49.454 --> 00:28:51.175]  I was against doing that to the Iraqis.
[00:28:51.495 --> 00:28:53.175]  I'd be against doing that to Eskimos.
[00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:54.716]  I'd be against doing it to Africans.
[00:28:54.996 --> 00:28:56.156]  Man, I got empathy.
[00:28:56.296 --> 00:28:57.857]  I don't believe in war crimes.
[00:28:58.397 --> 00:29:00.037]  I don't believe in being the bad guys!
[00:29:00.537 --> 00:29:02.958]  I don't believe in it being done in my name!
[00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:15.360]  And they did this to the Serbs, and they've done this to so many other people, and now they're going to do it, and have been doing it for two and a half years, and they're gonna bomb that country from one end to the other, and kill Russian troops.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.841]  They're evacuating all Russian civilians right now.
[00:29:18.521 --> 00:29:24.922]  There are Russian troops piling off ships right now to go into the country, as all the men, women, and children, and diplomats leave.
[00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:28.999]  And the Russians undoubtedly have brought nuclear weapons into Syria.
[00:29:29.219 --> 00:29:35.166]  You can bet your bottom dollar those missile cruisers they've got right off the coast have got nukes on them.
[00:29:36.588 --> 00:29:39.151]  Medium range cruise missiles.
[00:29:40.413 --> 00:29:42.295]  Basically Russian versions of Tritons.
[00:29:43.854 --> 00:29:45.756]  I mean, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:46.437 --> 00:29:47.378]  This is not a joke.
[00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:50.481]  But here's what's happening, so-called elite.
[00:29:50.781 --> 00:29:52.022]  You're all butt-naked.
[00:29:52.162 --> 00:29:53.203]  Everybody's seeing this.
[00:29:53.484 --> 00:29:56.266]  You got 9% of people supporting you, okay?
[00:29:56.827 --> 00:29:58.168]  Everybody sees who you are.
[00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:59.570]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.672]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.593 --> 00:30:05.275]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.787 --> 00:30:22.916]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.

[00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:12.908]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:31:13.148 --> 00:31:18.429]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:26.210]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:35.512]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:31:35.712 --> 00:31:42.701]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:31:42.861 --> 00:31:45.745]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:31:45.765 --> 00:31:51.712]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[00:31:52.393 --> 00:31:52.673]  War.
[00:31:52.954 --> 00:31:54.175]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:31:54.215 --> 00:31:55.236]  Another plane just hit!
[00:32:09.665 --> 00:32:16.969]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:32:17.409 --> 00:32:21.211]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[00:32:21.651 --> 00:32:35.198]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.

[00:33:14.004 --> 00:33:17.507]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:18.087 --> 00:33:19.828]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:47.720]  There is a proxy war going on between the bankers, the globalists, the New World Order faction that runs much of Western Europe, England, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:33:49.244 --> 00:33:55.052]  They are gearing up for a proxy war, an open war, beyond proxy, with Russia.
[00:33:57.375 --> 00:34:06.146]  And WorldNetDaily has translated a whole slew of videos shot last week of the Al Qaeda, Qatari,
[00:34:09.028 --> 00:34:16.654]  Saudi Arabians, Al-Qaeda forces, with Al-Qaeda flags, by the way, singing Osama bin Laden.
[00:34:16.674 --> 00:34:17.655]  I mean, it is disgusting.
[00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:19.417]  Firing chemical weapons.
[00:34:19.437 --> 00:34:21.338]  You know they videotape everything they attack.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:35.751]  And they know you're so dumb, and the globalists have got this so badly coordinated, that they are firing chemical weapons on video, in a whole slew of videos uploaded last week.
[00:34:36.764 --> 00:34:39.305]  And they're bragging it's theirs on their YouTube channels!
[00:34:39.525 --> 00:34:41.005]  They're even allowed to have YouTube channels!
[00:34:41.526 --> 00:34:44.347]  Imagine if I had a YouTube channel launching chemical attacks?
[00:34:44.427 --> 00:34:54.730]  I mean, there'd be 50 black helicopters, highways shut down, Alex Jones the ultimate evil, our media is so controlled, there's all these videos of the Western forces.
[00:34:54.750 --> 00:35:03.053]  And that's why Kerry came out yesterday and said it doesn't matter who it turns out launched this, we can't allow this to be used, it's Assad's fault this is happening.
[00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:08.228]  And the Wall Street Journal quotes him as well today saying, it doesn't matter who did it.
[00:35:09.469 --> 00:35:11.951]  It's Assad's fault and we must take over the country now.
[00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:14.153]  We must lock these weapons down.
[00:35:14.173 --> 00:35:22.959]  Remember earlier this year when Israel bombed reported chemical weapons storehouses in Syria, which all major governments have?
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.921]  They said it was because the rebels had gotten in and they didn't want them to have it.
[00:35:26.642 --> 00:35:29.764]  Was that an Israeli cover story because they knew they were really getting them in there to get them?
[00:35:30.065 --> 00:35:30.405]  I don't know.
[00:35:31.482 --> 00:35:41.009]  The point is, it's rebels with what looks like Russian chemical weapons saying Allah Akbar, you know, death to Assad, firing them!
[00:35:41.709 --> 00:35:47.713]  Video after video of them shelling neighborhoods so they could then blame it on Assad.
[00:35:47.973 --> 00:35:58.781]  And our stinking, wicked media, CNN, MSNBC, Fox, Neocon talk show hosts, you know who's out there promoting that we've got to go in against Assad now.
[00:36:00.205 --> 00:36:03.547]  The same neocons that promoted the banker bailout, but then later said it was bad.
[00:36:03.647 --> 00:36:04.948]  I am so tired of it, folks.
[00:36:05.748 --> 00:36:07.909]  And I'm not trying to differentiate myself with other talk show hosts.
[00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:09.590]  I'm not going to say their names.
[00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.391]  I just wish they weren't evil.
[00:36:11.411 --> 00:36:13.552]  Because they're not stupid.
[00:36:14.292 --> 00:36:23.417]  Thank God WorldNetDaily is telling the truth because they've got a bunch of Arab speakers and former PLO people that work for them who have translated all this.
[00:36:23.537 --> 00:36:28.020]  And you can go and translate it on the Google translator out of Arabic into English as well with the text.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.002]  Enter into a text translator and it does say that.
[00:36:31.603 --> 00:36:36.428]  They're celebrating firing the chemical attack last week from multiple video angles.
[00:36:36.468 --> 00:36:37.289]  Them launching it.
[00:36:37.549 --> 00:36:39.451]  They also then videotaped it exploding.
[00:36:40.212 --> 00:36:42.554]  Then they go in and film with gas masks the people dying.
[00:36:42.995 --> 00:36:45.557]  It was their little Steven Spielberg production.
[00:36:46.587 --> 00:36:56.934]  Basically, it's a bunch of sicko jihadis doing this and detonating chemical weapons, and it is absolutely, thoroughly disgusting.
[00:36:56.954 --> 00:37:01.017]  You can see them blowing up cars, buses, trains, firing mortars.
[00:37:02.158 --> 00:37:02.618]  How many videos?
[00:37:02.638 --> 00:37:04.059]  There are like eight videos on the page?
[00:37:05.741 --> 00:37:09.103]  I mean, there's four posted and a bunch of links in the article to others.
[00:37:09.483 --> 00:37:10.424]  This is unbelievable.
[00:37:10.584 --> 00:37:11.465]  And then Paul Watson?
[00:37:12.617 --> 00:37:15.860]  Earlier this year found video of them doing the same thing and bragging.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.241]  Look, we have chemical weapons.
[00:37:18.863 --> 00:37:21.946]  And by the way, some of these guys have been on BBC and CNN.
[00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:22.987]  They're rebel leaders.
[00:37:23.327 --> 00:37:28.612]  It's not like they're Assad forces posing as Syrian rebels to do a reverse false flag.
[00:37:29.593 --> 00:37:30.614]  They don't even care!
[00:37:30.974 --> 00:37:35.098]  Because the establishment goes, look, the American people will buy anything.
[00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:40.052]  They might as well have John Kerry go over there and load the mortars.
[00:37:40.232 --> 00:37:41.733]  We already had John McCain and others.
[00:37:42.253 --> 00:37:43.514]  Show McCain visits the rebels.
[00:37:43.854 --> 00:37:44.614]  Photos and video.
[00:37:46.195 --> 00:37:47.636]  Including meeting with the guy.
[00:37:47.696 --> 00:37:54.619]  There's video of McCain meeting with the guy who two months later has a heart of a guy he just killed and is eating it on TV.
[00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.532]  And if you're a new listener, by the way, write everything down I'm saying and look it up.
[00:37:59.373 --> 00:38:00.994]  I can't even believe this, okay?
[00:38:01.054 --> 00:38:04.137]  I mean, this is so beyond anything I can imagine.
[00:38:04.417 --> 00:38:11.342]  Al Qaeda hanging out with John McCain, and then chewing on hearts two months later, and firing chemical weapons, and then Kerry.
[00:38:12.343 --> 00:38:16.626]  I watched the video before I did the nightly news last night, and I watched it.
[00:38:17.887 --> 00:38:19.749]  I watched the seven-minute press conference.
[00:38:19.789 --> 00:38:21.310]  The White House has got another one coming up today.
[00:38:25.715 --> 00:38:34.025]  I got so enraged I couldn't, I mean I had to actually, and I don't ever do this folks, I had to actually go in my office and start yelling just so I wouldn't break something.
[00:38:34.676 --> 00:38:36.657]  And I psychoanalyzed why I got so upset.
[00:38:36.677 --> 00:38:38.217]  It's because I realized this could be World War III.
[00:38:38.638 --> 00:38:42.079]  We've got a bunch of madmen in control, and we haven't done enough to stop them.
[00:38:42.419 --> 00:38:43.820]  These globalists are madmen.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.861]  They're going to cause World War III, because out of the crisis they can get control.
[00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:48.722]  But I finally realized what made me sick.
[00:38:48.742 --> 00:39:03.888]  It was that ugly Botox head, that giant, deformed, looks like alien head, of that piece of garbage, anti-American, anti-gun, anti-family, banker bailout, derivatives pushing, scam artist, scumbag, black widow.
[00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:08.093]  Male black widow, on record, John Kerry.
[00:39:08.834 --> 00:39:09.935]  These people are like cancers.
[00:39:09.955 --> 00:39:14.839]  They just never get out of our lives saying, I want you to go watch those videos because they're painful.
[00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:24.006]  And he has this sick look in his eye and he knows that other people aren't psychopaths like him and he can use the pain of those kids to sell a much more giant war.
[00:39:24.206 --> 00:39:25.747]  And then it clicked while I was so upset.
[00:39:26.327 --> 00:39:32.732]  I know the State Department, when the Pentagon doesn't like something, because the Pentagon's been bucking this and they've been not getting congressional approval.
[00:39:33.533 --> 00:39:35.054]  They've been doing it with other governments and NATO.
[00:39:35.775 --> 00:39:38.537]  That it's the State Department that's running this.
[00:39:38.937 --> 00:39:39.777]  And then it all clicked.
[00:39:39.938 --> 00:39:44.741]  I'm upset because that's the guy that gave the order for the chemical attack.
[00:39:45.101 --> 00:39:46.422]  How absurdist is that?
[00:39:46.502 --> 00:39:47.123]  And sick.
[00:39:48.143 --> 00:39:51.946]  On TV, using the dead kids to launch an even bigger war.
[00:39:52.687 --> 00:39:54.328]  That's why I became physically ill.
[00:39:58.177 --> 00:40:00.738]  I want to talk to current serving military personnel.
[00:40:01.118 --> 00:40:02.479]  What do you think about this evil?
[00:40:02.499 --> 00:40:02.739]  800-259-9231.
[00:40:02.759 --> 00:40:03.099]  800-259-9231.
[00:40:03.999 --> 00:40:11.502]  I want to get your take on what I just said.
[00:40:11.862 --> 00:40:13.043]  Is anything I've said not true?
[00:40:14.003 --> 00:40:16.284]  I mean, plus, you don't just believe me if you're a regular listener.
[00:40:16.444 --> 00:40:18.705]  Just everything I said, I just gave you the headlines.
[00:40:19.025 --> 00:40:25.408]  Washington Post, new poll, Syria intervention, even less popular than Congress, 9% approval rating, scientific poll.
[00:40:26.633 --> 00:40:27.613]  Boom, there's that article.
[00:40:28.234 --> 00:40:31.615]  Israeli gas mass distribution ramps up amid Syrian escalation.
[00:40:31.915 --> 00:40:33.476]  Suspected chemical weapons use.
[00:40:35.516 --> 00:40:35.857]  Evidence.
[00:40:35.937 --> 00:40:37.017]  Syria gas attack.
[00:40:37.057 --> 00:40:37.717]  Work of U.S.
[00:40:37.857 --> 00:40:38.277]  allies.
[00:40:38.398 --> 00:40:40.478]  Dr. Jerome R. Corsi?
[00:40:40.498 --> 00:40:42.979]  I mean, that is so bold.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.300]  He's basically saying what we're saying.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.921]  It was basically run by the globalists.
[00:40:47.831 --> 00:40:48.792]  Run by Kerry.
[00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:50.113]  Unbelievable.
[00:40:50.433 --> 00:40:51.354]  With the video to prove it.
[00:40:51.974 --> 00:40:59.739]  Zawahiri, the number one head of Al-Qaeda worldwide, says to Syrian rebels, Damascus first, then Cairo, then Jerusalem, and salutes America.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.842]  The head of Al-Qaeda salutes America.
[00:41:04.823 --> 00:41:07.044]  I have entered the twilight zone, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:13.289]  And they know once the war starts, and we're in a fight with the Russians, the average American will turn their guns in, they'll do whatever Obama says.
[00:41:16.028 --> 00:41:16.868]  Unbelievable.
[00:41:16.928 --> 00:41:21.831]  Inspectors in Syria forbidden from finding out who used chemical weapons only if they were used.
[00:41:22.171 --> 00:41:23.031]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:41:24.212 --> 00:41:24.452]  Yeah.
[00:41:25.712 --> 00:41:29.294]  Yeah, now they've said, that's what Kerry said, it doesn't matter who did this, because he knows he gave the order!
[00:41:29.794 --> 00:41:31.115]  He's over the operation!
[00:41:31.995 --> 00:41:34.756]  That skull and bones brother, that devil incarnate!
[00:41:35.456 --> 00:41:39.978]  I mean, this is more than I... I can't even believe this, how... They're not even hiding any of it now.
[00:41:40.699 --> 00:41:43.460]  I guess they decided in the information age, they just will do whatever they want.
[00:41:44.724 --> 00:41:47.866]  Here it is, military strikes on Syria as early as Thursday, U.S.
[00:41:47.906 --> 00:41:49.306]  officials say, NBC.
[00:41:50.987 --> 00:41:54.629]  Syria crisis, Russia and China step up warning over strike.
[00:41:54.749 --> 00:41:56.970]  Meanwhile, the globalists have already moved all their assets to China.
[00:41:57.331 --> 00:41:59.192]  They're setting America up for a fall here.
[00:42:00.032 --> 00:42:01.393]  This is the ultimate double cross.
[00:42:01.973 --> 00:42:04.054]  Western warplanes begin arriving in Cyprus.
[00:42:04.554 --> 00:42:07.396]  Zero Hedge, it's also in London Guardian.
[00:42:09.175 --> 00:42:10.396]  But meanwhile, that doesn't matter.
[00:42:10.436 --> 00:42:12.778]  Miley Cyrus was humping on somebody on TV.
[00:42:12.818 --> 00:42:15.440]  That's more important than what people are saying in the polls.
[00:42:16.081 --> 00:42:17.302]  Syria strike due in days.
[00:42:17.362 --> 00:42:18.763]  West tells opposition sources.
[00:42:18.783 --> 00:42:19.284]  Reuters.
[00:42:20.405 --> 00:42:21.546]  On and on.
[00:42:21.846 --> 00:42:22.106]  U.S.
[00:42:22.146 --> 00:42:24.528]  to release report in coming days justifying Syrian strike.
[00:42:25.249 --> 00:42:27.671]  President set to have a White House briefing today, pushing it.
[00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:34.076]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, and by the way, once they start a war with Syria, they can shut up false flags and blame it on them.
[00:42:34.737 --> 00:42:35.377]  And Iran,
[00:42:36.434 --> 00:42:39.157]  And everybody will say, well, Iran, you know, we better get behind the president.
[00:42:39.177 --> 00:42:52.789]  This is how an imploding president, with all these scandals, the Fast and Furious, the Benghazi, the NSAgate, all of it, this is how this corrupt foreign coup, this banker coup will keep control of America.
[00:42:52.809 --> 00:42:52.869]  800-259-9231.
[00:42:53.009 --> 00:42:56.673]  We're going to go to the active duty military that's calling in.
[00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:04.932]  But first, I want to go to a few clips here to remind you of what's happened before.
[00:43:05.272 --> 00:43:10.294]  Here is the Kuwaiti daughter of the ambassador, who hadn't been to Kuwait since she was a baby.
[00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:11.314]  Here she is as a teenager.
[00:43:11.535 --> 00:43:12.715]  They wouldn't even say what her name was.
[00:43:13.075 --> 00:43:15.336]  Putting out the lie of the incubators that never happened.
[00:43:15.696 --> 00:43:20.638]  Then we'll show you how the media then spun the babies.
[00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:25.940]  And then Wesley Clark, the former head of NATO General, admitting it was all a fraud.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.061]  Let's go to the first clip.
[00:43:27.808 --> 00:43:39.812]  Our final witness is also using an assumed name, and again we ask our friends in the media to respect the need for her to protect her family.
[00:43:39.832 --> 00:43:40.832]  These people are so criminal.
[00:43:41.333 --> 00:43:44.274]  And we finally call on Maria to testify.
[00:43:44.334 --> 00:43:45.674]  So criminal, folks.
[00:43:45.694 --> 00:43:51.276]  I volunteered at the Al-Adan Hospital with 12 other women who wanted to help as well.
[00:43:51.296 --> 00:43:53.677]  I was the youngest volunteer.
[00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:56.358]  The other women were from 20 to 30 years old.
[00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:02.271]  While I was there, I saw the Iraqi soldiers coming to the hospital with guns.
[00:44:03.471 --> 00:44:05.212]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[00:44:08.813 --> 00:44:11.854]  Took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:44:11.874 --> 00:44:12.694]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:44:13.735 --> 00:44:17.896]  And then in the next clip, they go through all the lies and say they were bayonetting the pregnant women.
[00:44:18.876 --> 00:44:25.298]  Same thing Robert Rodriguez did with his machete movie.
[00:44:27.042 --> 00:44:31.103]  Where it shows the cowboys shooting pregnant Hispanics.
[00:44:31.123 --> 00:44:33.743]  I mean, it's war propaganda, folks.
[00:44:34.883 --> 00:44:36.104]  This is what propagandists do.
[00:44:36.144 --> 00:44:37.464]  They wave the bloody shirt.
[00:44:37.904 --> 00:44:39.544]  And they're doing it like you're an idiot.
[00:44:39.584 --> 00:44:41.565]  The good news is, here's my message to the globalists.
[00:44:41.985 --> 00:44:47.186]  You have a 9% approval rating in a major scientific poll.
[00:44:47.206 --> 00:44:48.286]  9% of people agree with you.
[00:44:49.446 --> 00:44:51.686]  This shows you are a different group than America.
[00:44:51.926 --> 00:44:54.587]  This shows we have a rogue criminal government.
[00:44:57.591 --> 00:45:02.834]  The Pentagon, by the way, doesn't want to attack Syria and hasn't been liking what's going on, and morale's at all-time lows.
[00:45:02.874 --> 00:45:04.495]  So they're running through the State Department.
[00:45:05.015 --> 00:45:13.320]  Remember, when you see John Kerry up there, folks, that's who probably gave the order to release the nerve gas on the one-year anniversary of Obama, saying that's the red line.
[00:45:15.641 --> 00:45:16.522]  How sick is that?
[00:45:17.002 --> 00:45:23.466]  That'd be like Jeffrey Dahmer having a press conference about kids missing in the neighborhood while he's got a barrel right next to him with a five-year-old in it.
[00:45:24.591 --> 00:45:27.072]  I mean, this is just over the top, man!
[00:45:27.132 --> 00:45:28.733]  Reality is so insane!
[00:45:29.733 --> 00:45:33.655]  Now let's go to them hyping this up, then we'll go to Max and Steve and others, active duty.
[00:45:35.075 --> 00:45:43.779]  Let's go to the clip then, after she gave the testimony of why we had to attack Iraq in 2003, but before this, in 1990.
[00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:52.342]  They took the babies out of incubators, took the incubators and left the children to die
[00:45:53.447 --> 00:45:55.348]  And Carrie's like, they nerve gas the children.
[00:45:55.468 --> 00:45:59.089]  How these animals can commit such barbaric and inhuman acts.
[00:45:59.109 --> 00:46:00.109]  This woman's almost laughing.
[00:46:00.169 --> 00:46:02.090]  To even deny that these acts ever took place.
[00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:02.730]  Look at that lying line.
[00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:16.114]  Premature infants in incubators were sentenced to die by having the incubators removed.
[00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:23.036]  The hardest thing was burying their babies.
[00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:33.692]  I myself buried 14 newborn babies that had been taken from their incubators.
[00:46:34.172 --> 00:46:45.104]  Now is the time to check the aggression of this ruthless dictator whose troops have bayoneted pregnant women and have ripped babies from their incubators in Kuwait.
[00:46:45.424 --> 00:46:46.946]  I cannot help but think of my nephew.
[00:46:48.186 --> 00:46:50.589]  Who if born premature might have died that day as well.
[00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:58.557]  They had kids in incubators and they were thrown out of the incubators so that Kuwait could be systematically dismantled.
[00:46:59.518 --> 00:47:05.004]  Alright folks, turned out that was a complete lie and over 5 million Iraqis died, over a million of them from military...
[00:47:07.301 --> 00:47:08.282]  Connected events.
[00:47:08.462 --> 00:47:10.003]  That's the British Medical Journal.
[00:47:10.463 --> 00:47:14.866]  500,000 children by 1997 had already starved to death or died.
[00:47:14.947 --> 00:47:18.329]  That is Madeleine Albright admitting that, saying it was, quote, a good price to pay.
[00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:20.631]  By the way, can you find her saying that for folks that don't believe me?
[00:47:21.111 --> 00:47:25.474]  Just search YouTube, Madeleine Albright, 500,000 dead Iraqi children, and it'll come up for you.
[00:47:25.914 --> 00:47:26.715]  It's a good price to pay.
[00:47:27.576 --> 00:47:31.639]  By the way, the Esquire magazine didn't believe me when I told them that, and then they went and found it.
[00:47:32.239 --> 00:47:36.801]  We're like, oh my gosh, it's like, oh, 500,000 kids, eh, it's like a pothole, no big deal.
[00:47:36.821 --> 00:47:39.962]  You know, it's like, you know, getting your windshield cracked, it's no big deal.
[00:47:40.182 --> 00:47:42.243]  Oh, but the children in Syria, they got nerve gas.
[00:47:42.623 --> 00:47:44.384]  Now, in the case of the incubators, it didn't happen.
[00:47:44.664 --> 00:47:46.465]  In the case of the nerve gas kids, oh, it happened.
[00:47:46.765 --> 00:47:56.349]  And they're like, ha-la, ha-la, ha-la, I love you so much, ha-la, ha-la, and they're shooting the missiles off on their official YouTube channels.
[00:47:57.149 --> 00:48:00.051]  And singing, we love Obama!
[00:48:00.232 --> 00:48:02.914]  There's videos of this, we're putting them together for the Obama deception.
[00:48:03.154 --> 00:48:06.016]  Just dancing around, Obama we love you!
[00:48:06.537 --> 00:48:10.760]  I mean, you cannot make up stuff this weird.
[00:48:11.821 --> 00:48:17.685]  Now I'm going to go to some phone calls, and then we're going to get into the other video clips of war propaganda.
[00:48:17.705 --> 00:48:18.986]  Let's get to one more before I go to the calls.
[00:48:19.547 --> 00:48:22.129]  Here is Wesley Clark on the Seven Nation Hit List.
[00:48:23.148 --> 00:48:27.229]  Well, they bring him in and go, yeah, here's the countries we're going to hit, and we're going to make stuff up to do it.
[00:48:27.249 --> 00:48:27.830]  Here's that clip.
[00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:37.293]  I went through the Pentagon 10 days after 9-11, and an officer from the Joint Staff called me into his office and said, I want you to know, he said, sir, we're going to attack Iraq.
[00:48:38.373 --> 00:48:39.153]  And I said, why?
[00:48:40.114 --> 00:48:40.454]  He said,
[00:48:41.826 --> 00:48:42.447]  We don't know.
[00:48:42.988 --> 00:48:45.973]  And then I came back to the Pentagon about six weeks later, I saw the same officer.
[00:48:45.993 --> 00:48:48.758]  I said, why haven't we attacked Iraq?
[00:48:48.778 --> 00:48:49.919]  Are we still going to attack Iraq?
[00:48:49.959 --> 00:48:51.782]  He said, oh sir, it's worse than that.
[00:48:52.003 --> 00:48:54.106]  I just got this memo from the Secretary of Defense's office.
[00:48:54.166 --> 00:48:55.028]  It says we're going to attack
[00:48:55.859 --> 00:48:58.220]  And destroy the governments in seven countries.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.781]  This was before 9-11 by the way.
[00:49:00.001 --> 00:49:06.764]  We're going to start with Iraq and then we're going to move to Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran.
[00:49:07.384 --> 00:49:08.805]  And they use Al Qaeda to do it.
[00:49:09.245 --> 00:49:11.826]  Let's go to Max in Wisconsin, Active Military.
[00:49:11.846 --> 00:49:12.947]  Are you Army, Marines?
[00:49:13.387 --> 00:49:15.048]  And then we're going to go to Steve and others that are holding.
[00:49:15.088 --> 00:49:16.309]  What's your take on this Max?
[00:49:17.969 --> 00:49:19.290]  Hello Mr. Jones.
[00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:23.012]  I was wondering if you'd like to know how to stop this situation in Syria.
[00:49:24.741 --> 00:49:28.142]  Well, yeah, have sanity prevail and have the American people stop the globalists.
[00:49:28.162 --> 00:49:29.103]  I mean, what's your take on it?
[00:49:30.163 --> 00:49:42.047]  Okay, well, like in Serbia, when they did mortar attacks in the northern Croatian border, they have to provide targeting systems and GPS coordinates via satellite.
[00:49:42.307 --> 00:49:45.288]  That's right, so they have GPS jammers and the Russians reportedly have those.
[00:49:46.168 --> 00:49:48.769]  The same thing will be going on in Syria right now.
[00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:53.611]  If you find the corporate company that probably has connections to an American company,
[00:49:54.504 --> 00:50:03.729]  Or another company, such as L3 Communications, or such MPRI, companies like that, you can probably backlog that back to the state.
[00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:12.814]  Yeah, we have a lot of people calling in saying, track the contractors, and when they're actually, the contracts in the last two years have been going on assisting the rebels.
[00:50:13.174 --> 00:50:15.836]  I want my reporters to look into that and do some reports, I've seen that.
[00:50:16.236 --> 00:50:20.458]  But no, they've been moving all sorts of even heavy equipment in, not just, not just things like that.
[00:50:20.478 --> 00:50:23.400]  I mean, is there any way to unjam when the Russians jam?
[00:50:25.554 --> 00:50:27.179]  Well, it's not jamming.
[00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:29.848]  It's more providing for the chemical attack.
[00:50:29.888 --> 00:50:31.052]  They use mortars, right?
[00:50:31.233 --> 00:50:31.433]  Yes.
[00:50:33.283 --> 00:50:38.105]  In order to launch those mortars, especially with chemical warfare, you have to be very, very accurate.
[00:50:38.706 --> 00:50:41.907]  And the rebels themselves cannot provide such accuracy.
[00:50:42.348 --> 00:50:43.648]  So that must be done... No, no, no.
[00:50:43.688 --> 00:50:44.268]  I get your point.
[00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.689]  No, exactly.
[00:50:44.709 --> 00:50:46.029]  The State Department's directing all this.
[00:50:46.089 --> 00:50:49.371]  So, yeah, I'm sure Kerry probably sat around in his office with the coordinates.
[00:50:49.691 --> 00:50:50.592]  Sir, we're going to hit this area.
[00:50:50.612 --> 00:50:52.032]  It's a civilian area that'll be used.
[00:50:52.352 --> 00:50:52.813]  But stay there.
[00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:53.713]  I want to come back to you.
[00:50:53.733 --> 00:50:57.075]  I mean, you can just see Kerry in there with the computer screens, picking the targets, probably.
[00:50:57.715 --> 00:50:58.716]  That's who does that.
[00:50:58.796 --> 00:51:01.358]  Then he can go out and give you a speech about it after he killed all those kids.
[00:51:01.659 --> 00:51:02.079]  I'll say it.
[00:51:02.099 --> 00:51:02.960]  He's the prime suspect.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.941]  I believe John Kerry murdered the children.
[00:51:05.342 --> 00:51:05.942]  We'll be right back, sir.
[00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:07.464]  I'm going to come back to you, Max, and then Steven.
[00:51:09.693 --> 00:51:10.874]  You know about RVs.
[00:51:11.074 --> 00:51:12.315]  You've heard about bunkers.
[00:51:12.535 --> 00:51:15.097]  But surviving is not recreation.
[00:51:15.297 --> 00:51:17.798]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[00:54:11.578 --> 00:54:12.699]  Alright, folks, we're back live.
[00:54:12.719 --> 00:54:16.282]  You know, when I talk to Active Duty, though, they'll never even talk about what they're doing.
[00:54:16.302 --> 00:54:19.064]  Because they don't want to end up like Bradley Manning, I get that.
[00:54:19.124 --> 00:54:27.392]  But then they go too far, because they're just like, I would look in this general area at the L3 systems used to target these things and look at the contracts.
[00:54:27.992 --> 00:54:30.294]  Instead of just saying, hey, these groups are over there aiding the rebels.
[00:54:30.714 --> 00:54:32.515]  That's actually come out in the news.
[00:54:32.695 --> 00:54:42.983]  I just want your perspective as active duty about what does it feel like to be in a military run by foreign banks in an occupied America, trying to start war with Russia, aiding Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:43.223 --> 00:54:45.324]  And then going, well, Assad's a bad guy.
[00:54:45.745 --> 00:54:48.547]  No, he's not, compared, he was democratizing the country.
[00:54:48.867 --> 00:54:50.308]  They don't want free countries over there.
[00:54:50.608 --> 00:54:53.090]  They're going to put jihadis in to run around murdering everybody.
[00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.332]  So, so, Mac, specifically,
[00:54:56.152 --> 00:55:07.401]  It's on record there are CIA commandos, MI6, SAS, you name it, actually leading different brigades of the scum that's over there, these martyrs' brigades.
[00:55:08.481 --> 00:55:09.902]  So that's actually come out in the news.
[00:55:10.923 --> 00:55:14.066]  I wonder how those people feel being part of this.
[00:55:14.526 --> 00:55:17.808]  And I wonder how the Obama folks think they're going to cover this up.
[00:55:17.828 --> 00:55:19.630]  Your take on that, Max, and then we'll go to Stephen.
[00:55:21.591 --> 00:55:22.452]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:55:22.472 --> 00:55:23.733]  I wish
[00:55:24.485 --> 00:55:35.129]  That I could provide more specifics, but these shadowy groups and agencies and corporations are always changing up their names and using the bureaucracy kind of against us.
[00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:38.091]  Do you think they're using contractors or commandos?
[00:55:39.611 --> 00:55:50.276]  Oh, they're using both, but the ones for the communication intel is most likely a corporate entity that was sent in there for some sort of other reason.
[00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:55.424]  Uh, in order to provide like a cover, because they, you know, it's pretty sophisticated stuff.
[00:55:55.644 --> 00:55:55.965]  Sure, sure.
[00:55:55.985 --> 00:55:56.785]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:55:56.805 --> 00:56:04.771]  I know both are in there, but I'm saying, aiding them up front with a chemical attack, I mean, I wouldn't want to be the people helping the rebels launch a chemical attack.
[00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:06.472]  Those people are all going to get killed.
[00:56:06.773 --> 00:56:07.813]  I mean, how dumb are they?
[00:56:09.294 --> 00:56:19.402]  Um, let's just say they're cut from a different cloth, and they believe in a different God than we do, and they worship a different entity than we do, and frankly, I'm sick of the blood
[00:56:20.151 --> 00:56:23.938]  Do you think Obama will get away with attacking Syria to aid Al-Qaeda openly?
[00:56:34.471 --> 00:56:35.011]  It's up to us.
[00:56:35.071 --> 00:56:36.292]  It's the same thing with Serbia.
[00:56:36.552 --> 00:56:39.234]  That was the first time it was whites killing whites.
[00:56:40.094 --> 00:56:43.136]  I don't mean that racially, but we let it happen.
[00:56:44.096 --> 00:56:50.439]  And, you know, you can pick a war if the American people let it happen and let the blood be on their hands.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.962]  Depends on how much soap, how much gojo they're going to use to try to wash it off.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:03.343]  Uh, but it seems like we're already pretty much just doused and soaked in this blood of civilians that we don't even know the numbers of how many.
[00:57:03.363 --> 00:57:06.364]  Well, it's just crazy to be aiding Al Qaeda when they're going to wreck the whole place.
[00:57:06.404 --> 00:57:07.304]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:07.644 --> 00:57:10.245]  Let's talk to Stephen in California, active duty Marine.
[00:57:10.665 --> 00:57:13.246]  Stephen, what is your take on this and what are people saying around you?
[00:57:13.266 --> 00:57:14.866]  I want to get the sense of the military.
[00:57:15.086 --> 00:57:16.327]  Are they getting what's happening here?
[00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:20.036]  It's a pleasure to be on your show, Alex.
[00:57:20.176 --> 00:57:20.877]  Thank you for having me.
[00:57:20.897 --> 00:57:21.278]  Thank you.
[00:57:21.658 --> 00:57:26.282]  Yeah, I'm actually a Marine over here at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.
[00:57:28.124 --> 00:57:32.829]  Most of the military, like the younger guys, they don't pay attention to much to what's going on.
[00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:35.732]  They're too busy trying to be a Marine and stuff.
[00:57:35.872 --> 00:57:37.513]  That's the way I feel it.
[00:57:37.533 --> 00:57:39.015]  The higher ups, you tell them about it.
[00:57:39.335 --> 00:57:40.396]  I try to tell them about it.
[00:57:40.556 --> 00:57:42.178]  I say, hey, do you guys know who Alex Jones is?
[00:57:43.099 --> 00:57:45.340]  He's a patriot.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.862]  You guys should listen to him.
[00:57:46.882 --> 00:57:48.523]  He has a lot of good points on what's going on.
[00:57:49.504 --> 00:57:52.446]  People just kind of don't know who you are.
[00:57:52.506 --> 00:57:55.029]  And the people that do know who you are, they're already good to go.
[00:57:55.809 --> 00:58:01.694]  I'm not surprised that they're going to try to go after Syria now and stage a false flag.
[00:58:01.734 --> 00:58:08.520]  I've got to say, and I guess that's out of the Navy SEAL base there, I've got to say the Navy, and I've said this before, is the least awake group I run into.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:09.301]  The Army.
[00:58:09.901 --> 00:58:10.681]  It's over half.
[00:58:11.461 --> 00:58:14.742]  Marines, a lot of times, it's about 30-40%.
[00:58:15.282 --> 00:58:21.464]  But, yeah, some of the younger folks don't know what's going on, but you're saying when you do talk to people who do listen to the show, they're aware.
[00:58:21.484 --> 00:58:24.165]  I mean, look, when WorldNetDaily's covering this, they're in trouble.
[00:58:24.825 --> 00:58:25.925]  This is all starting to come out.
[00:58:25.985 --> 00:58:27.706]  Anything else you'd like to add, Stephen?
[00:58:28.921 --> 00:58:32.262]  You know, honestly, Alex, I've been trying to call into your show for a while.
[00:58:32.322 --> 00:58:33.262]  I've been listening for a year.
[00:58:33.282 --> 00:58:33.862]  Stay there.
[00:58:34.022 --> 00:58:34.402]  Stay there.
[00:58:34.422 --> 00:58:35.503]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[00:58:35.523 --> 00:58:36.383]  We'll start the next hour.
[00:58:36.403 --> 00:58:37.463]  We're going to go to you.
[00:58:37.483 --> 00:58:43.644]  Then Dr. Jerome Corsi, who was on yesterday, he'll be joining us with the bombshell info.
[00:58:44.945 --> 00:58:45.285]  Evidence.
[00:58:45.385 --> 00:58:46.545]  Syrian gas attack.
[00:58:46.625 --> 00:58:47.225]  Work of U.S.
[00:58:47.325 --> 00:58:47.805]  allies.
[00:58:51.906 --> 00:58:55.867]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:59.938 --> 00:59:00.539]  It's hurricane
[00:59:18.422 --> 00:59:19.062]  I think so.
[00:59:38.737 --> 00:59:39.818]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[00:59:48.902 --> 00:59:49.983]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:50.003 --> 00:59:51.283]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:13.939 --> 01:00:18.141]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:19.601]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.361 --> 01:00:21.282]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:21.902 --> 01:00:25.503]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.104 --> 01:00:30.225]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.928 --> 01:00:42.670]  Russia and China are warning against a strike, saying they're going to respond.
[01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:49.491]  Give the West, caught red-handed, running Al Qaeda, staging the chemical attack.
[01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:50.931]  Dr. Corsi has the proof.
[01:00:50.971 --> 01:00:52.252]  He's joining us in the next segment.
[01:00:53.332 --> 01:00:54.112]  That's right, folks.
[01:00:54.212 --> 01:00:56.852]  The rebels have been caught three separate times launching chemical attacks.
[01:00:56.892 --> 01:01:00.613]  That's why John Kerry... It's a seven-minute video.
[01:01:00.633 --> 01:01:02.493]  Will you guys watch it in there and cue it up to the part?
[01:01:02.634 --> 01:01:03.914]  It's in the middle towards the end.
[01:01:03.934 --> 01:01:05.474]  It's in, like, the last third, I think.
[01:01:06.034 --> 01:01:07.434]  I played it last night and analyzed it.
[01:01:07.474 --> 01:01:10.115]  He says, uh... And it doesn't matter who did it!
[01:01:11.138 --> 01:01:12.158]  We need to invade!
[01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:13.599]  Because they know they did it!
[01:01:13.699 --> 01:01:15.720]  I mean, it is so crazy.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.461]  I mean, I know it's in the Wall Street Journal as well, but I want to play you that clip.
[01:01:21.582 --> 01:01:23.523]  So just watch the last half of the seven-minute Kerry clip.
[01:01:23.543 --> 01:01:26.184]  It's on the computer from a State Department briefing, and I want to show that.
[01:01:26.524 --> 01:01:34.507]  Going back to Stephen, who is a Marine stationed out in Southern California, there in San Diego, you wanted to make some points.
[01:01:34.547 --> 01:01:34.887]  Go ahead.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.480]  I think so.
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:02:02.749]  Yeah, I want to bring up the fact, you know, I'm not surprised that the, you know, that the military is doing because the Marine Corps and specifically, I can only speak for the Marine Corps, they're, they're really, they're really shady, you know, regarding especially suicide, you know, I had my best friend Jeffrey Gens, PFC Gens, he died April 24, 2009, he committed suicide in the barracks, you know, when I was at the duty, you know, he was my best friend.
[01:02:03.209 --> 01:02:15.616]  You know, he committed suicide and they, uh, they forced, they, my staff and CO made me go in his room and inventory his stuff and, uh, take all of his furniture out of his room because I was, I was working for the barracks manager at the time.
[01:02:15.636 --> 01:02:22.880]  You know, the, the Marine Corps, like I've seen personally, you know, I've seen, seen the Marine Corps do shady stuff, you know, and it was really terrible.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.762]  You know, um, uh, that I had to go through that.
[01:02:25.782 --> 01:02:26.922]  Well, that's putting it lightly.
[01:02:26.962 --> 01:02:31.105]  The Marine Corps for over a hundred years has overthrown more than 80 governments.
[01:02:31.645 --> 01:02:39.214]  Schmedley Butler himself helped overthrow six, and he wrote a book called War is a Racket, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
[01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:48.305]  He was in line to be the Commandant of the Marine Corps, but he refused it because he was offered that job to be part of a coup d'etat against America, and he would be called a traitor by the foreign banks.
[01:02:48.385 --> 01:02:49.226]  No, he's a patriot.
[01:02:50.009 --> 01:02:53.771]  And of course, I mean, now the military is in the hands of the globalists.
[01:02:54.271 --> 01:03:00.935]  The average military person, after they're out, is the number one enemy of the globalists, because you've been trained to be a killer, but you don't work for them now.
[01:03:01.635 --> 01:03:06.037]  So, the military better wake up and defend the republic and decide what side they're on.
[01:03:06.518 --> 01:03:07.778]  And spread the word to everybody you know.
[01:03:07.798 --> 01:03:08.499]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:09.586]  Absolutely.
[01:03:09.766 --> 01:03:12.628]  I got your, I have your fluoride stickers, your blue fluoride stickers.
[01:03:12.648 --> 01:03:18.073]  I have your Pro-1 Traveler, you know, Pro-1 Bipropia Traveler for my water.
[01:03:18.433 --> 01:03:19.154]  I eat organic.
[01:03:19.194 --> 01:03:21.456]  I'm looking into your tangy tangerine pretty soon.
[01:03:22.016 --> 01:03:26.320]  You know, I've changed my life since I started listening to your show, John, in a good way, you know what I mean?
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.802]  Well, God bless you.
[01:03:28.522 --> 01:03:35.108]  Most of the stuff I hear you say, sometimes I think it sounds crazy, but I get on my laptop and I look it up and I see that you're legit, you know what I'm saying?
[01:03:35.188 --> 01:03:37.149]  Well, God bless you, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[01:03:37.469 --> 01:03:39.950]  Yeah, let me bring something up that he mentions, the water filters we sell.
[01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:41.151]  I didn't plug anything last hour.
[01:03:41.171 --> 01:03:42.292]  The books, the videos.
[01:03:42.612 --> 01:03:47.394]  We go out and find great things that we use, and then give you a very low price, or the lowest price.

[01:08:22.042 --> 01:08:25.644]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.225 --> 01:08:30.268]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:31.994 --> 01:08:33.996]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[01:08:34.196 --> 01:08:36.639]  We are on the verge of what could be World War III.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:48.891]  As Dr. Jerome Corsi said yesterday, and as many top analysts are now saying, the Russians and the Chinese are now threatening NATO, saying, if you strike them, there will be repercussions.
[01:08:48.911 --> 01:08:53.235]  There are Russian troops piling off ships right now into Syria.
[01:08:54.315 --> 01:08:57.056]  And Russian civilians are being evacuated.
[01:08:57.076 --> 01:09:02.519]  NBC News is announcing that they plan to start bombing as early as Thursday or Friday.
[01:09:02.539 --> 01:09:03.899]  It'll happen Thursday or Friday.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:08.581]  The Washington Post has the headline from a Reuters poll, scientific.
[01:09:09.142 --> 01:09:14.564]  Only 9% of respondents said they believed that the U.S.
[01:09:14.604 --> 01:09:18.206]  military should respond to what's happening in Syria.
[01:09:19.352 --> 01:09:24.195]  And the vast majority also do not believe that the Syrian government launched the chemical attack.
[01:09:24.476 --> 01:09:29.579]  Yeah, because it goes against logic and we've caught them in these lies over and over again.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.162]  And no one believes a word Obama says.
[01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:34.062]  Now here's my issue.
[01:09:34.122 --> 01:09:41.107]  When Kerry gets up and says it doesn't matter, we're going to play this clip coming up, says it doesn't matter who did it.
[01:09:41.147 --> 01:09:42.288]  That's also in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:43.257 --> 01:09:46.181]  We've got to go in because the chemicals have been used.
[01:09:46.381 --> 01:09:46.962]  It's incredible.
[01:09:47.562 --> 01:09:50.186]  Well, there are videos up on WorldNetDaily.com.
[01:09:50.206 --> 01:09:54.391]  We have it linked on Infowars.com right now.
[01:09:55.092 --> 01:09:57.294]  And WorldNetDaily has the Arab speakers to break it down.
[01:09:57.334 --> 01:09:57.835]  We've checked it.
[01:09:57.875 --> 01:09:58.776]  It's how it translates.
[01:09:59.197 --> 01:10:02.040]  They're up there with the mortars firing them.
[01:10:03.188 --> 01:10:04.189]  This is unprecedented.
[01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:05.010]  Here's the headline.
[01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:07.011]  Syria gas attack.
[01:10:07.191 --> 01:10:08.312]  Work of U.S.
[01:10:08.552 --> 01:10:09.033]  allies.
[01:10:09.173 --> 01:10:10.194]  Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:10:10.614 --> 01:10:12.476]  Very respected person.
[01:10:12.916 --> 01:10:16.899]  Of course, Ph.D., Harvard University, political science.
[01:10:17.039 --> 01:10:21.303]  New York Times bestselling author of Unfit for Command and so many other amazing books.
[01:10:21.663 --> 01:10:24.766]  Worked as a consultant at the highest levels of national security.
[01:10:25.226 --> 01:10:26.087]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:34.018]  I know large areas of the Pentagon know this is a pure evil what's about to happen, and the Russians will probably respond.
[01:10:34.078 --> 01:10:35.219]  So I want to give him the floor.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.742]  We've only got him for this segment.
[01:10:37.881 --> 01:10:44.785]  Dr. Corsi, how big is this, that they're doing this, and that they don't have support?
[01:10:45.105 --> 01:10:51.509]  Bush had 72% in Gallup polls, and Pew had 72% in 2003.
[01:10:52.809 --> 01:11:00.173]  I think this is the total collapse of credibility, but it's kind of like Hitler wasn't supported at the end either, but he was still in control of the Reich.
[01:11:00.554 --> 01:11:01.494]  What are we seeing here?
[01:11:01.514 --> 01:11:02.655]  And break down this bombshell.
[01:11:03.243 --> 01:11:18.953]  Well, first of all, Alex, the article we've got running on worldatdailywnd.com right now, as you say, I went yesterday and researched, checked with the Arabic-speaking sources, Waleed Chobat, who helped write the article.
[01:11:20.033 --> 01:11:33.860]  There's numerous videos on the internet and in the Arabic-speaking world that make it clear the rebels are the ones who have launched the sarin gas attacks, not the Assad government.
[01:11:34.608 --> 01:11:37.268]  Now, the Assad government is not a great government.
[01:11:37.308 --> 01:11:42.749]  I mean, there's no good guys in Syria, but the point is the truth is the truth.
[01:11:42.869 --> 01:11:59.812]  And I think the attempt by the Obama administration, which now appears to be the second time the Obama administration has tried this, it was the narrative being run out of the White House back in May that the Assad government was launching chemical attacks.
[01:12:00.212 --> 01:12:02.913]  But the problem is that there's no validation of it.
[01:12:03.513 --> 01:12:04.774]  There's no hard proof.
[01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:09.577]  John Kerry, Secretary of State, said yesterday he has indisputable proof.
[01:12:09.677 --> 01:12:10.998]  Well, let's see it.
[01:12:11.938 --> 01:12:13.339]  Why don't we see this proof?
[01:12:13.639 --> 01:12:14.480]  It's not there.
[01:12:15.481 --> 01:12:25.607]  Even the United Nations, going back to May, doubted very seriously that the Assad regime, as bad as it is, was going to use sarin gas attacks.
[01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.949]  As you said, it does not make any sense.
[01:12:29.309 --> 01:12:34.350]  Why, when the Assad government's winning, would it resort to sarin gas attacks?
[01:12:35.131 --> 01:12:52.295]  And with video after video, with testimony after testimony coming out of the Arab world, in Syria it's widely known that it's the rebels, which are a group of Al-Qaeda, Muslim Brotherhood, ragtag radicals.
[01:12:53.171 --> 01:12:53.391]  That's
[01:13:09.754 --> 01:13:12.656]  Gas and the other chemicals coming from Saudi Arabia.
[01:13:12.676 --> 01:13:22.121]  I mean, it seems to me that if the Obama administration is going to go to war on Syria, which is what this means, a very massive step.
[01:13:22.681 --> 01:13:29.845]  I can't emphasize to people listening how much we are on the verge here of World War III.
[01:13:30.446 --> 01:13:32.247]  Russia and China are not going to sit by
[01:13:33.027 --> 01:13:50.639]  If Obama thinks he can wag the dog, get attention off of his other problems, or run a false flag here, it isn't going to fly with Russia and China saying to Obama, you don't have the evidence, and we're not going to tolerate a military attack.
[01:13:53.902 --> 01:13:54.262]  That's it.
[01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:54.962]  That's it.
[01:13:55.843 --> 01:13:58.505]  It's a very, very frightening moment in U.S.
[01:13:58.585 --> 01:13:59.806]  and world history.
[01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:04.721]  Very, very succinctly said, Dr. Corsi.
[01:14:04.801 --> 01:14:09.104]  I want to break something down for my listeners and viewers out there.
[01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:13.567]  You have never talked like this in the decade that I've been interviewing you or more.
[01:14:14.748 --> 01:14:19.612]  And I've talked to a lot of other top people on and off air about this.
[01:14:20.592 --> 01:14:22.914]  Colonel Schaefer is one of them, but many others off record.
[01:14:23.454 --> 01:14:25.616]  And they all are saying exactly what you're saying.
[01:14:26.757 --> 01:14:27.958]  And it's so transparent.
[01:14:28.658 --> 01:14:30.780]  How does Obama think he's going to get away with this?
[01:14:31.604 --> 01:14:36.628]  Well, again, I think the Obama Administration has gotten to the point where they think they can lie with impunity.
[01:14:37.249 --> 01:14:39.090]  Certainly, that's what this appears to be.
[01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:44.635]  And, you know, Alex, I don't think we've been in a more critical moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:14:45.275 --> 01:14:52.661]  Now, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Jack Kennedy had photographs of the missiles from U-2 flights over Cuba.
[01:14:53.162 --> 01:14:55.263]  And Jack Kennedy showed those to the world.
[01:14:55.303 --> 01:15:00.288]  He went to the United Nations and he said, here's the pictures of the missiles in Cuba.
[01:15:00.948 --> 01:15:02.289]  Obama has not done that.
[01:15:02.309 --> 01:15:12.156]  Obama has not presented to the American people or to the UN his evidence of the Assad regime being involved in the sarin gas attacks.
[01:15:12.576 --> 01:15:25.865]  And you've got Assad denying it, you've got Russia denying it, you've got China denying it, all of them with logic on their side, and we publish at WND the videos where you can see with your own eyes
[01:15:26.525 --> 01:15:33.038]  The terrorists, the rebels, the forces Obama's supporting being the culprits in the gas attacks.
[01:15:33.564 --> 01:15:37.005]  Absolutely, and we're linked to that article as well and mirrored at Infowars.com.
[01:15:37.045 --> 01:15:48.787]  It's very important that people get all the articles that are coming out at WND.com, DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, and get those out to everybody.
[01:15:49.347 --> 01:15:58.089]  And I'm very sad to see some of the mainline conservative talk radio saying, well, I don't like Assad or I don't like the rebels either, but I don't like Obama, but we got to get behind this.
[01:15:58.629 --> 01:16:01.170]  I think Obama is gambling that if they can start the war,
[01:16:02.674 --> 01:16:07.536]  And then undoubtedly, they've got Russian anti-aircraft missiles, Russian anti-ship missiles.
[01:16:07.836 --> 01:16:10.197]  You will see Americans die, probably in large numbers.
[01:16:10.597 --> 01:16:12.598]  They think Americans are going to get behind this.
[01:16:12.778 --> 01:16:13.979]  I don't think that's the case.
[01:16:14.479 --> 01:16:17.260]  Because usually going into one of these, they've got over 70%.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.541]  They've got 9% approval rating.
[01:16:20.041 --> 01:16:23.263]  I think this is one of the most historic things to ever happen to the globalists.
[01:16:23.823 --> 01:16:25.404]  I believe we've seen a collapse.
[01:16:26.124 --> 01:16:35.996]  In their con game here and that the fact that the rebels had to launch this because they're losing the war, the Al Qaeda rebels, shows desperation on so many fronts.
[01:16:36.356 --> 01:16:41.342]  Dr. Corsi, what does this poll number signify and is there any way for Obama
[01:16:42.324 --> 01:16:48.372]  And his kleptocratic wing to back off out of this, or will they really try to commit us to World War III?
[01:16:48.412 --> 01:16:49.533]  What are your sources saying?
[01:16:49.934 --> 01:16:51.135]  I want to make a couple of points.
[01:16:51.335 --> 01:17:00.807]  One, first of all, people got to realize that, you know, Russia and China are not borrowing a trillion dollars a year to make their budget.
[01:17:01.454 --> 01:17:01.894]  We are.
[01:17:02.555 --> 01:17:07.037]  We're in a vastly weakened economic position, and the world knows it.
[01:17:07.678 --> 01:17:16.243]  Secondly, where American public opinion is right now is not in favor of a military action, and I don't see it changing quickly.
[01:17:16.883 --> 01:17:23.367]  Now, let's say we have a cruise missile attack or we have a bomber attack over Syria.
[01:17:24.228 --> 01:17:27.710]  If we get involved in a shooting war, not just with Syria,
[01:17:28.450 --> 01:17:37.637]  But with Russia, or with Russia and China, the ramifications of that are unpredictable and unpredictably frightening.
[01:17:38.437 --> 01:17:45.942]  Because if Russia and China say to the United States, you can't sustain a war economically, and you're on the wrong side here,
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:18:01.387]  And if Russia and China stand behind Assad, which they are doing, we are moving, we're escalating the whole conflict beyond the level of surrogates into where we're risking a direct confrontation with Russia, certainly with Russia.
[01:18:01.407 --> 01:18:07.350]  And giving them the moral high ground, which history shows you cannot win a immoral war long term.
[01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:20.057]  Well, where is, you know, at least with Jack Kennedy in the White House, he sent Adlai Stevenson, who was the UN ambassador to the UN, and he showed the pictures of the missiles in Cuba.
[01:18:21.027 --> 01:18:22.488]  Today, we don't have a single thing.
[01:18:22.508 --> 01:18:27.731]  By the way, they're coming out with this new dossier, but I expect that to be more, you know, phony baloney as well.
[01:18:27.751 --> 01:18:28.512]  What are you expecting?
[01:18:28.972 --> 01:18:31.514]  Remember, we've had, we've gone through this.
[01:18:31.674 --> 01:18:35.196]  The left is, the publicity here is amazing to me.
[01:18:35.256 --> 01:18:45.463]  When it was George W. Bush saying there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the left, John Kerry, Barack Obama, were all over the issue, saying it was a lie.
[01:18:45.883 --> 01:18:46.204]  And now,
[01:18:46.724 --> 01:18:53.586]  You've got Obama and Kerry using the same lie to advance what could end up being another phony pretext for a phony war.
[01:18:53.606 --> 01:18:56.626]  I think the American people can see through this.
[01:18:56.666 --> 01:18:57.867]  Sure, we've got one minute left.
[01:18:57.947 --> 01:19:00.207]  Bottom line, what do you expect to happen in your gut?
[01:19:00.748 --> 01:19:06.149]  My gut is that the Obama administration is so far out of the limb they're going to attack and we're going to come to the edge of World War III.
[01:19:07.532 --> 01:19:08.953]  Unfortunately, I agree with you.
[01:19:08.973 --> 01:19:11.695]  I hope everybody's saying their prayers for their children tonight.
[01:19:13.035 --> 01:19:14.977]  People better understand how serious this is.
[01:19:15.057 --> 01:19:19.479]  It's been one of the most serious moments in world history that we have ever faced.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:25.123]  And they're all doing it because these power-mad control freaks that run Washington think they're invincible.
[01:19:25.974 --> 01:19:42.242]  And Obama does not want us talking about the IRS scandal with the Tea Party groups or the NSA eavesdropping on Benghazi or the fact that we're again out of money and spending another trillion dollars we don't have on an out-of-control budget.
[01:19:42.282 --> 01:19:43.783]  Obama doesn't want these topics.
[01:19:43.803 --> 01:19:46.564]  Doctor, we're going to have to get updates from you every day if we can do it.
[01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:47.625]  I know you've got to go.
[01:19:47.945 --> 01:19:49.266]  Please join us again tomorrow.

[01:24:47.429 --> 01:24:51.693]  But also looking at major threats to humanity and why the elite is so arrogant, the technocracy,
[01:24:53.271 --> 01:25:10.914]  We have scheduled for the balance of the hour Dr. Noel Sharkey, who is a PhD professor of artificial intelligence and robotics and a professor of public engagement at the University of Sheffield, Department of Computer Science and journal editor.

[01:25:43.239 --> 01:25:44.479]  That's the headline by Paul Watson.
[01:25:45.686 --> 01:25:52.950]  He also wrote the paper, Big Robot Is Watching You, Reporting the Future of Robots for Policing, Surveillance, and Security by Professor Noel Sharkey.
[01:25:53.711 --> 01:25:55.272]  And he joins us for the Balance of the Hour.
[01:25:55.312 --> 01:26:04.918]  We really appreciate him coming on today because I wanted people to really think about, as humans, we better decide the future of our development.
[01:26:05.868 --> 01:26:17.666]  Collectively and through free-thinking ideas and renaissance, not through the military-industrial complex worldwide that Eisenhower warned of, that was already deciding our journey when he gave that speech in 1961.
[01:26:20.265 --> 01:26:29.471]  And he said it's the technological elite in his speech running that, who a lot of them are eugenicists and pretty anti-human, and they think the computers are better than us, if you look at what they put out.
[01:26:29.511 --> 01:26:32.033]  So we've got him on, and I just think people should know about this.
[01:26:33.093 --> 01:26:35.095]  He was already scheduled last week.
[01:26:35.115 --> 01:26:40.839]  I appreciate him coming on and being cut a little bit short because of the horrible, serious situation, but this is very important as well.
[01:26:40.859 --> 01:26:41.939]  We've got a long segment coming up.
[01:26:41.959 --> 01:26:42.740]  This is a short segment.
[01:26:43.902 --> 01:26:46.807]  Dr. Sharkey, we're very honored to have you here with us.
[01:26:46.867 --> 01:26:48.491]  In a nutshell, what are we facing?
[01:26:48.911 --> 01:26:50.214]  What are we dealing with here, sir?
[01:26:53.195 --> 01:26:55.317]  Hi Alex, it's great to be back on the show again.
[01:26:55.357 --> 01:26:56.337]  That's an honour as well.
[01:26:56.758 --> 01:26:57.538]  Thank you for that.
[01:26:57.978 --> 01:27:00.420]  Well, we're facing all sorts of things.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:10.907]  There's a lot of bad things that could happen, but one of the worst is really for me is the use by the military of autonomous weapons and or robots.
[01:27:11.347 --> 01:27:19.333]  And what we mean by that in simple terms is simply a weapon that once it's been launched can select its own
[01:27:19.813 --> 01:27:25.258]  And even last year, the US Air Force already launched an autonomous drone, and I know the UK has already as well.
[01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:37.284]  Yes, that's right.
[01:27:37.584 --> 01:27:44.286]  There's the X-47B, which is the United States one, and they're fairly advanced in testing.
[01:27:44.326 --> 01:27:52.227]  It can leave an aircraft carrier, land on an aircraft carrier, and there was a lot of bravo about what it was going to do in the Pacific.
[01:27:52.647 --> 01:27:59.549]  But since our campaign has started, they're starting to say things like, yeah, there's going to be a human supervising it if it's used for attacks.
[01:28:02.213 --> 01:28:03.054]  Continue, Doctor.
[01:28:03.894 --> 01:28:04.314]  Oh, sorry.
[01:28:05.195 --> 01:28:11.599]  So, they're saying there's going to be a human supervising it, but they're not being clear about what they mean by human supervising it.
[01:28:11.639 --> 01:28:25.189]  I've heard your Dan Quaylar from your Congressional Committee for Unmanned Systems, the Congressional Caucus, saying that, for instance, that there'll always be somebody on the loop to program it.
[01:28:25.609 --> 01:28:27.991]  And that does not fill me with joy, I must say.
[01:28:28.511 --> 01:28:40.900]  Because the idea of a weapon system going off and finding its own targets at the minute is ridiculous because there's no way that a robot can discriminate between a child and a soldier.
[01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:43.822]  At the moment, let me put it in perspective.
[01:28:44.323 --> 01:28:48.366]  Just this week, there's been an announcement for a massive European project.
[01:28:48.846 --> 01:28:49.206]  Okay?
[01:28:50.007 --> 01:28:50.768]  7 million euros.
[01:28:50.808 --> 01:28:53.450]  That's about, I don't know what that is, eight and a half million dollars?
[01:28:54.190 --> 01:29:10.246]  And what the project is, it's six big universities, all specialists in robotics, and what they're going to be working over the next five years is finding a system, a robot, that can tell the difference between an old person lying on the ground, collapsed, and a duffel bag.
[01:29:12.096 --> 01:29:13.477]  That's how advanced we are.
[01:29:13.938 --> 01:29:20.284]  So, if that's the case, how could you possibly be contemplating sending these things into the theatre of war?
[01:29:20.604 --> 01:29:23.267]  It's absurd to me, and morally outrageous.
[01:29:24.308 --> 01:29:24.908]  Absolutely.
[01:29:24.968 --> 01:29:32.956]  Plus, the reason I wanted to get you on, the big issue for me, is that the technocrats act like they're not even human.
[01:29:32.976 --> 01:29:35.379]  They're basically inbred psychopaths, so they're not really even human.
[01:29:36.357 --> 01:29:37.318]  We see them throughout history.
[01:29:37.358 --> 01:29:38.858]  Stalin, Hitler, all these people.
[01:29:39.599 --> 01:29:41.780]  They want machines because they'll follow orders.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:45.021]  Soldiers could say no to immoral orders.
[01:29:45.062 --> 01:29:48.583]  I want to talk about the Nuremberg question here of just following orders.
[01:29:49.204 --> 01:29:53.106]  You know, will we execute robots or will we execute people that build the killer robots?
[01:29:53.166 --> 01:29:53.626]  Stay with us.
[01:29:58.548 --> 01:29:59.469]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.949 --> 01:30:01.570]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:05.152]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.534 --> 01:30:12.817]  Every three seconds, someone becomes a victim of identity theft.
[01:30:13.097 --> 01:30:17.201]  We also hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on U.S.
[01:30:17.241 --> 01:30:17.722]  citizens.

[01:31:10.057 --> 01:31:17.384]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[01:31:17.824 --> 01:31:21.628]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[01:32:09.415 --> 01:32:13.058]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:32:13.298 --> 01:32:18.562]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:32:18.802 --> 01:32:26.367]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:32:26.527 --> 01:32:35.634]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:32:35.834 --> 01:32:42.843]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:32:43.003 --> 01:32:45.887]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:32:45.907 --> 01:32:51.854]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[01:32:52.535 --> 01:32:52.835]  War.
[01:32:53.095 --> 01:32:54.296]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:32:54.356 --> 01:32:55.656]  Another plane just hit!
[01:32:55.696 --> 01:32:56.516]  State of Mind.
[01:32:56.776 --> 01:32:58.177]  Because there's a war on.
[01:32:58.337 --> 01:32:59.117]  For your mind.
[01:32:59.377 --> 01:33:03.398]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.

[01:33:17.415 --> 01:33:18.096]  Launch the drones!
[01:33:18.116 --> 01:33:25.701]  Flashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:26.682 --> 01:33:33.047]  Here come the autonomous drones, all programmed and run by the same folks that control Goldman Sachs.
[01:33:34.893 --> 01:33:35.233]  J.P.
[01:33:35.273 --> 01:33:39.935]  Morgan with their high-frequency trading milking billions off a day of investors' money.
[01:33:39.975 --> 01:33:49.558]  It's all a big gamed technocracy programmed by the little globalist elves who are absolutely cornering the market on humanity worldwide.
[01:33:49.598 --> 01:33:51.539]  People ask me, what's your agenda?
[01:33:51.599 --> 01:33:53.380]  As if you can't listen to the show and tell what it is.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:56.801]  Sometimes on the street people walk up and say, what's the point of all this?
[01:33:57.401 --> 01:33:57.741]  I don't know.
[01:33:57.761 --> 01:33:58.641]  I want justice.
[01:33:58.741 --> 01:33:59.962]  I want my children to have a future.
[01:34:00.522 --> 01:34:05.303]  I don't want to just turn the world over to technocratic machines and smart meters that run my life.
[01:34:05.984 --> 01:34:07.944]  We're already in an incredible technocracy right now.
[01:34:07.964 --> 01:34:11.585]  Can you imagine how much worse it's going to get with these cold-blooded eugenicists running things?
[01:34:12.126 --> 01:34:15.907]  We're going back to the amazing Dr. Noel Sharkey to look at the big questions.
[01:34:16.767 --> 01:34:19.930]  We were just posing here in just a moment.
[01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:25.815]  But before we do that, there's two new films out that I'm the exclusive distributor of, and they're both excellent.
[01:34:26.295 --> 01:34:29.377]  American Drug War 2, it's been five years since he put out a film.
[01:34:29.778 --> 01:34:31.960]  This thing is now airing starting this week on cable.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.361]  It's on Showtime.
[01:34:33.381 --> 01:34:40.231]  The point is it's very powerful and exposes how the drug war destroys families, how the government's drug dealing, just all of it.
[01:34:40.251 --> 01:34:42.374]  It's a very powerful, great way to wake people up.
[01:34:42.815 --> 01:34:48.944]  Get the film at InfowarsStore.com and your purchase also supports the overall broadcast of what we're doing in the news division.
[01:34:50.131 --> 01:34:58.434]  Then we have the film of myself and a bunch of professors and psychologists and psychiatrists and Army Psychological Warfare Colonel and just everybody's in there.
[01:34:58.454 --> 01:34:59.175]  It's very powerful.
[01:34:59.875 --> 01:35:11.660]  It is state of mind getting into the whole history and current and future systems of mind control and the film is available on DVD and Blu-ray at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:12.200]  And then lastly,
[01:35:18.567 --> 01:35:20.927]  We sell the best gravity filtration system.
[01:35:20.968 --> 01:35:21.968]  I did two years of study.
[01:35:22.288 --> 01:35:23.848]  Didn't carry any gravity fed filters.
[01:35:24.348 --> 01:35:27.589]  We used to carry another one and then I just had some issues.
[01:35:27.609 --> 01:35:29.569]  Looked at the competition, did research.
[01:35:29.849 --> 01:35:34.270]  Took me two years to find ProPure, test it, look at it, do the side-by-side comparisons.
[01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:36.871]  It is the best gravity fed filter out there.
[01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:39.411]  Blows away the competition side-by-side.
[01:35:39.851 --> 01:35:42.092]  It's available 10% off the lowest price.
[01:35:43.192 --> 01:35:46.955]  At InfowarsStore.com with promo code WATER.
[01:35:46.995 --> 01:35:48.636]  Just to check out, enter WATER.
[01:35:49.717 --> 01:35:51.198]  The evil, the hydrogen monoxide.
[01:35:51.238 --> 01:35:52.839]  Just type in the word WATER.
[01:35:53.079 --> 01:35:54.020]  W-A-T-E-R.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.281]  And get 10% off the already lowest price.
[01:35:56.321 --> 01:35:58.183]  Cuts out the fluoride, the glyphosate with the Pro-1.
[01:35:59.043 --> 01:36:01.025]  It's all there with the Pro Pure with the Pro One.
[01:36:01.426 --> 01:36:05.890]  Infowarsstore.com or call, we can answer your questions, take your order over the phone, 888-253-3139.
[01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:08.772]  Go check out the whole line right there at Infowarsstore.com, 888-253-3139.
[01:36:08.792 --> 01:36:11.715]  And my nightly news division, the magazine, the syndicated radio show.
[01:36:20.143 --> 01:36:22.826]  We're reaching about 15 million people a week, one way or another, globally.
[01:36:23.487 --> 01:36:32.959]  I want to double that the next year, and it is your financial support, and shopping with the good guys, voting with your dollars, your euros, whatever the case is around the world, that funds this operation.
[01:36:32.979 --> 01:36:34.681]  So I want to thank all of you out there.
[01:36:34.721 --> 01:36:39.366]  Be sure and support our local Eminem affiliates by sponsoring them and supporting their sponsors as well.
[01:36:40.532 --> 01:36:47.614]  Okay, so the Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, who has done research projects at Yale and Stanford.
[01:36:47.654 --> 01:36:50.995]  Boy, Stanford Research Institute's the real top of the pyramid.
[01:36:51.535 --> 01:36:58.257]  He joins us from England, where the Watsons are from, their beautiful Sheffield, Robin Hood land.
[01:36:59.097 --> 01:37:02.218]  What about the issue of not just the robots getting out of control,
[01:37:03.302 --> 01:37:21.942]  But, the Pentagon's own plan to get rid of all combat troops, all combat aircraft, have it all just programmed, and then have technicians on floating fortresses, they say they're going away from aircraft carriers, to more like giant 1984 equivalent of oil rig cities, that are basically autonomous robot bases.
[01:37:23.343 --> 01:37:26.404]  The robot factories back on the mainland are built by robots.
[01:37:26.784 --> 01:37:27.705]  You have technicians.
[01:37:28.245 --> 01:37:31.246]  Already most AI people say they don't even know how the computers work.
[01:37:31.546 --> 01:37:32.886]  Different experts have to come together.
[01:37:33.326 --> 01:37:36.347]  I mean, aren't we losing our humanity through this?
[01:37:36.567 --> 01:37:38.808]  And what would happen...
[01:37:39.808 --> 01:37:42.510]  With old Nuremberg thing of just following orders doesn't cut it.
[01:37:42.970 --> 01:37:50.095]  We already have the military saying no to a lot of attacks today and stopping Bush and then now Obama from launching bigger wars.
[01:37:50.115 --> 01:37:50.695]  That's come out.
[01:37:50.975 --> 01:37:53.497]  What about once it's 90% autonomous robots?
[01:37:53.857 --> 01:37:57.700]  I mean, isn't this like Attack of the Clones or something, doctor?
[01:37:58.635 --> 01:38:00.296]  Yeah, you're exactly right there.
[01:38:00.557 --> 01:38:04.420]  I mean, I don't go as far into the future as you with what you're saying.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:11.585]  I think that part of that is a kind of US military complex fantasy, to be honest, with a lot of sabre rattling.
[01:38:12.006 --> 01:38:14.427]  And what you're going to get is a lot of failed systems.
[01:38:14.808 --> 01:38:17.210]  And that's going to be disastrous for your country, really.
[01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:27.498]  But in terms of a dictatorship or some sort of authoritarian regime, well, you imagine the Arab Spring in Egypt, the soldiers refused to fire.
[01:38:28.118 --> 01:38:30.019]  Qaddafi's soldiers refuse to fire.
[01:38:30.039 --> 01:38:33.581]  Autonomous robots are not going to refuse to fire on anybody, are they?
[01:38:33.621 --> 01:38:35.743]  They just do what you program them to do.
[01:38:36.123 --> 01:38:42.967]  So if you're an evil dictator, all you need is a bunch of very loyal henchmen who are programmers, and you're away.
[01:38:43.347 --> 01:38:45.589]  You're going to be able to kill people left, right and centre.
[01:38:45.869 --> 01:38:51.472]  Particularly if you're not very moral, like Syria at the moment, and you're not really concerned about civilians.
[01:38:51.773 --> 01:38:54.094]  That's a perfect place for robots at the moment.
[01:38:54.394 --> 01:38:55.335]  I hate to say that,
[01:38:55.655 --> 01:39:02.958]  And I don't want to put ideas into Assad's head, but that would be the ideal thing for him, would just have robots slaughtering everybody.
[01:39:03.198 --> 01:39:06.079]  And it wouldn't be that hard when you're not worried about the morality.
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:09.080]  Break that down, some of the systems.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.841]  It's not just drones you write about.
[01:39:11.261 --> 01:39:16.963]  They've got drone tanks, drone cars, drone submarines, swords.
[01:39:17.283 --> 01:39:21.605]  They've got the eater, as it's called, that like eats dead people to fuel itself.
[01:39:25.896 --> 01:39:26.817]  We just lost his audio.
[01:39:26.837 --> 01:39:27.677]  Go ahead, Doctor.
[01:39:33.021 --> 01:39:34.021]  We'll get you reconnected.
[01:39:34.041 --> 01:39:35.803]  Skype's wonderful, but sometimes it has problems.
[01:39:36.763 --> 01:39:45.369]  I want him to break down, really, when he gives these big conferences to governments, you name it, what their concerns are.
[01:39:45.389 --> 01:39:46.389]  Because the good news is,
[01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:52.638]  That there are people in the system as well that are concerned.
[01:39:53.499 --> 01:40:00.630]  Sir, you were telling my producer that the good news is a lot of people in government are concerned, but then also want to get into some of the systems that are being developed.
[01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.711]  You've got the floor.
[01:40:01.731 --> 01:40:02.593]  I mean, give us a briefing.
[01:40:03.399 --> 01:40:05.760]  Okay, well let me tell you a bit of a story then.
[01:40:06.341 --> 01:40:15.206]  Last year, we started this International Committee for Robot Arms Control, a small group of four of us international, in 2009.
[01:40:15.846 --> 01:40:19.688]  There are 26 of us now, professionals, and we're an NGO now.
[01:40:19.988 --> 01:40:25.652]  And what happened was last year, Human Rights Watch came to see me in Sheffield to discuss the issues.
[01:40:26.232 --> 01:40:36.418]  And they decided to, along with the great Article 36 of British NGO, they decided to work with us and start a campaign and the Nobel Women's Initiative.
[01:40:36.438 --> 01:40:38.399]  So lots of Nobel Peace Prize winners there.
[01:40:38.979 --> 01:40:40.780]  And so we got together.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:48.785]  Human Rights Watch in November last year wrote a report called Losing Humanity, the case against killer robots.
[01:40:49.165 --> 01:40:58.711]  I advised them on that and that started getting governments talking a little bit, the US at least, because before that we could not get any international discussion at all.
[01:40:59.552 --> 01:41:02.374]  But Human Rights Watch is big so they managed to do something.
[01:41:02.694 --> 01:41:17.264]  The Department of Defense three days later issued guidelines for the development of autonomous weapons saying they'd always be supervised in some sort of way and I'll get into that a little bit more in a few minutes if you like about what they're planning.
[01:41:17.804 --> 01:41:18.465]  So after that
[01:41:19.725 --> 01:41:28.251]  We got together in New York after that, and then we launched a campaign from the UK in April the 23rd this year.
[01:41:28.951 --> 01:41:31.673]  And that was a very successful launch of a campaign.
[01:41:31.913 --> 01:41:35.176]  We got over 40 NGOs, including Amnesty International.
[01:41:35.536 --> 01:41:36.256]  Real biggies.
[01:41:36.616 --> 01:41:38.498]  And so we're really pushing governments now.
[01:41:39.038 --> 01:41:43.101]  But, you know, so it started them chattering a bit, which they weren't doing at all before.
[01:41:43.801 --> 01:41:51.765]  And let me just take a digression here for one second and tell you why it's very very important to me that governments talk to each other.
[01:41:52.425 --> 01:42:03.371]  Because what they're not thinking about, the United States in particular, and I must say that I love the United States, I've lived there, but you know one of the problems for me is it's extremely blinkered.
[01:42:03.831 --> 01:42:06.633]  It thinks it's the only technological country in the world.
[01:42:06.973 --> 01:42:08.934]  We'll come up with a technological solution.
[01:42:09.214 --> 01:42:10.835]  They did the same with the atomic bomb.
[01:42:10.855 --> 01:42:13.336]  They didn't really think the Russians were going to get it so quickly.
[01:42:13.857 --> 01:42:19.565]  So they come up with these brilliant developments, they're very creative, and then everybody else in the world copies them.
[01:42:19.965 --> 01:42:24.912]  And they think that they're going to build these autonomous robots and they want to send swarms of them out.
[01:42:24.932 --> 01:42:26.675]  It's force multiplication, they call it.
[01:42:26.915 --> 01:42:30.320]  So the idea is to use swarms of them to beat their enemy.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.181]  But their enemy are going to have them.
[01:42:32.462 --> 01:42:37.386]  China are developing them, Russia are developing them, Israel are developing them, the UK are developing them.
[01:42:37.866 --> 01:42:40.168]  Everybody will have them if we carry on like this.
[01:42:40.508 --> 01:42:49.276]  And the one thing that nobody knows, nobody on this planet knows, if you've got hidden secret programmes, strategic programmes for fighting,
[01:42:49.716 --> 01:42:54.158]  When those robots meet each other, nobody knows what the hell is going to happen.
[01:42:54.438 --> 01:42:55.378]  Anything could happen.
[01:42:55.738 --> 01:42:56.678]  I can't predict it.
[01:42:56.718 --> 01:42:57.779]  So that's a real worry.
[01:42:58.379 --> 01:43:07.942]  Now, the good news for us was that Christophe Haynes, who's the special rapporteur for extrajudicial killings for the United Nations, wrote a report.
[01:43:08.022 --> 01:43:10.363]  We all talked to him about it and discussed it with him.
[01:43:10.663 --> 01:43:13.104]  And he presented that report to the United Nations.
[01:43:13.804 --> 01:43:24.734]  In May the 29th this year and that report is calling for a complete moratorium throughout the world on the development of lethal autonomous robots.
[01:43:25.234 --> 01:43:31.620]  Now that's great news but of course all the governments now like the UK have been debating it in Parliament and the House of Lords.
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:49.210]  The United States have been debating it, France has been debating it, 24 countries showed up to debate it, but the big nations are saying, well of course you're right, these can't work with international humanitarian law, they can't comply, you're right, they can't discriminate and things yet.
[01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:51.831]  So we're going to make sure they're supervised.
[01:43:52.291 --> 01:43:58.173]  But now the big question that comes up, and it's a depressing question, is what do they mean by supervised?
[01:43:58.573 --> 01:44:03.375]  Do they mean some guy presses a button and stands there watching it while it kills people?
[01:44:03.795 --> 01:44:09.818]  Do they mean it's like the Patriot missile, which gives you 10 seconds to veto it if it finds a target?
[01:44:10.138 --> 01:44:11.158]  That's not what we want.
[01:44:11.458 --> 01:44:17.521]  We want proper, meaningful human supervision of all technology that is going to kill people.
[01:44:18.413 --> 01:44:20.014]  I better let you have a word there, Alex.
[01:44:20.294 --> 01:44:21.395]  No, it's true, it's true.
[01:44:22.335 --> 01:44:23.916]  Well, if I don't shut up, then I'll never shut up.
[01:44:23.936 --> 01:44:28.659]  So I can either shut up completely or just sit back and listen to you or have so many points I'll just be interjecting.
[01:44:29.019 --> 01:44:40.005]  We were just showing an Air Force training video of a drone flying over and spilling out, it was a futuristic projection, a bunch of baby killer drones.
[01:44:40.725 --> 01:44:46.689]  And then they already admit in Department of Homeland Security training drone videos, it shows them targeting American gun owners.
[01:44:48.149 --> 01:45:07.196]  So they're already fantasizing so all these cowardly government people can just send out a bunch of little, you know, foot-long or half-foot-long robots with nerve gas in them or with a hand grenade they throw at you or with a, you know, with a .357 Magnum mounted in it or a shotgun to kill us!
[01:45:07.676 --> 01:45:14.098]  And so it's just a bunch of bureaucrats fantasizing because robotics has gotten cheaper, weaponizing everything
[01:45:14.878 --> 01:45:16.560]  In just an orgy of evil.
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:18.001]  And I'm so sick of it.
[01:45:18.041 --> 01:45:19.883]  How about real conventions?
[01:45:20.404 --> 01:45:23.367]  And just like we've done with chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear weapons.
[01:45:23.727 --> 01:45:31.575]  How about we have conventions and use Isaac Asimov's first rule of robotics that you can have no robotic system that can do harm.
[01:45:31.875 --> 01:45:34.818]  Because obviously once you allow this out of the box,
[01:45:35.859 --> 01:45:47.409]  It's gonna move towards a singularity with the entire architecture of the entire robotic development system, not like NASA where so much technology came out of it to make our lives better, because it wasn't war-like.
[01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:58.839]  Now everything's war-like, so everything has a basic architecture for war, and the computers that may become AI someday, or the expert tell us that'll happen, will fundamentally have been engineered to kill!
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:01.622]  So I mean, it just sounds like the worst-case scenario!
[01:46:02.631 --> 01:46:10.358]  I think one thing you're right there, Asimov's first law, which is the only law you can really apply, a robot must not harm a human.
[01:46:11.599 --> 01:46:13.181]  That to me would be a perfect rule.
[01:46:13.461 --> 01:46:21.509]  Now what we're trying to do, and as you know I'm a professor of robotics, but I've now become an activist because of this, having never been an activist in my life before.
[01:46:21.909 --> 01:46:39.274]  But the problem is that what we're trying to get done here, and I've got really good people with me, the people working with me on this campaign are the people who got cluster munitions banned, the people who got landmines banned, and what we're trying to do is get a new international treaty to ban the kill function.
[01:46:39.594 --> 01:46:41.156]  We don't want to ban autonomous robots.
[01:46:41.176 --> 01:46:51.046]  They can be used for monitoring, you know, global climate change and a lot of useful things, but we want no robots ever, ever to decide to kill a human.
[01:46:51.366 --> 01:46:56.451]  That should just be written into the statement that goes in the sky in stone, as it were.
[01:46:56.691 --> 01:46:57.092]  Sure.
[01:46:57.732 --> 01:47:03.538]  But one of the big worries, another big worry of mine that you've just pointed to is this sort of idea of using robots
[01:47:03.558 --> 01:47:03.858]  We're good.
[01:47:26.724 --> 01:47:29.105]  Creeping authoritarianism, I would call it.
[01:47:29.465 --> 01:47:35.827]  And people just think, well, you know, people in the UK say, if you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to worry about.
[01:47:36.287 --> 01:47:54.074]  Well, the problem is, if you put these things into the hands of governments, governments in the West change every four or five years, put them into the hands of the governments, each new government inherits these weapons, they inherit this technology, and the laws can change because you don't set up laws you can't enforce.
[01:47:54.694 --> 01:48:08.121]  Now when you've got strike action in the UK, you've got collections of people protesting, you'll start seeing robots being used, maybe with water cannons to begin with, and you could start seeing a creeping authoritarianism coming throughout the West.
[01:48:08.442 --> 01:48:09.822]  And it can happen really quickly.
[01:48:10.122 --> 01:48:15.625]  People laugh at me when I say this and say, oh no, we're a democracy, this could never happen.
[01:48:15.685 --> 01:48:21.949]  Well you know as well as I do, you're the sort of person who does know what could happen if governments get this technology.
[01:48:23.516 --> 01:48:24.737]  Well, there's no doubt.
[01:48:24.877 --> 01:48:29.799]  I mean, they've already been caught using drones domestically in cattle wrestling things with the Department of Defense.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:34.942]  They're already using robots with the SWAT teams to go in and find out where you're at so they can kill you.
[01:48:35.502 --> 01:48:40.985]  I mean, the entire architecture, as I've said, and I'm not a professor like you, I just read what you write when countless others write.
[01:48:42.327 --> 01:48:42.787]  I don't think so.
[01:48:59.184 --> 01:49:05.649]  All these big defense contractor companies that, I mean, look at the robot smart meters controlling our houses.
[01:49:05.689 --> 01:49:09.952]  Look at the robot face scanning cameras and license plate reading cameras.
[01:49:09.972 --> 01:49:17.117]  I mean, just because something doesn't walk around like Robbie the Robot doesn't mean it's not a surveillance pod, an imperial probe droid.
[01:49:17.337 --> 01:49:18.738]  But let me ask you this question.
[01:49:20.219 --> 01:49:23.462]  What do you expect on the truly artificially intelligent front?
[01:49:24.082 --> 01:49:27.564]  I mean, obviously, when it comes to acting like a human, being able to reproduce,
[01:49:28.576 --> 01:49:45.556]  Being able to have sentient thoughts, they're probably pretty far off from that, but at least a computer that malfunctions and believes its mission is to, say, kill everybody or something else, I think that is becoming a probability.
[01:49:47.276 --> 01:49:51.537]  Certainly they can send a robot in to kill people, there's no question of that.
[01:49:52.218 --> 01:49:55.479]  I'm a bit sceptical about the time course of AI.
[01:49:55.499 --> 01:49:58.319]  I think it's going to take a very long time to get smart machines.
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:00.820]  But that's not going to stop the developments anyway.
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:02.821]  They're going to happen, smart machines or not.
[01:50:03.121 --> 01:50:04.541]  And that's one of the big worries.
[01:50:05.122 --> 01:50:09.423]  But as you say, what you've alluded to a couple of times is the big word that's used.
[01:50:09.503 --> 01:50:12.444]  I talk to weapons manufacturers quite a lot, believe it or not.
[01:50:12.924 --> 01:50:20.106]  And one of the big words that's used in the United States, and it's helped by the recession a lot, is the word jobs.
[01:50:20.826 --> 01:50:23.307]  Okay, this is bringing jobs to our people.
[01:50:23.807 --> 01:50:33.090]  You know, I talked to something like 200 weapons manufacturers at a big conference I was at, a big convention, and I walked around saying to everybody, well, you know,
[01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:40.913]  They were making, I mean, these companies making the tiniest little components like sensors for your predator robot, little bits of electronics.
[01:50:41.333 --> 01:50:43.394]  And I would say to all of them the same question.
[01:50:43.414 --> 01:50:46.054]  What are you going to do when Afghanistan stops?
[01:50:46.635 --> 01:50:47.615]  When Iraq stops?
[01:50:47.955 --> 01:50:49.756]  And they would all say the same thing.
[01:50:50.036 --> 01:50:51.937]  They would all say exactly the same thing.
[01:50:52.297 --> 01:50:54.317]  And that was, oh, we'll just start another war.
[01:50:54.497 --> 01:50:55.238]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:50:55.558 --> 01:50:56.778]  And they said it like a joke.
[01:50:57.158 --> 01:50:58.779]  But, you know, it wasn't very funny.
[01:50:58.919 --> 01:51:00.820]  No, no, and it's not a joke, and here's the deal.
[01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:05.723]  The biggest battleground is in our domestic countries, and that's what they're deploying these into.
[01:51:05.743 --> 01:51:07.244]  Stay there, we'll talk about that when we come back.
[01:51:07.564 --> 01:51:08.704]  Big news, by the way, on Syria.
[01:51:09.365 --> 01:51:13.467]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:51:14.128 --> 01:51:17.069]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:51:17.169 --> 01:51:25.474]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:51:26.107 --> 01:51:31.052]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:51:31.672 --> 01:51:42.642]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:51:43.042 --> 01:51:50.049]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:54.995]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:51:55.015 --> 01:51:58.199]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:05.589]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:06.891]  Protect your immune system.
[01:52:07.151 --> 01:52:08.213]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:52:08.735 --> 01:52:09.756]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:14.159]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:52:14.339 --> 01:52:19.942]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:52:20.062 --> 01:52:23.405]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:52:23.625 --> 01:52:26.186]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:26.306 --> 01:52:31.129]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.490]  Call 800-686-2237.

[01:52:38.638 --> 01:52:40.019]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[01:52:40.299 --> 01:52:44.423]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[01:52:44.723 --> 01:52:51.468]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[01:52:51.949 --> 01:52:55.792]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[01:52:56.212 --> 01:52:58.014]  Fortunately, there is something you can do about it.

[01:53:16.061 --> 01:53:19.863]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[01:54:13.504 --> 01:54:14.066]  All right, folks.
[01:54:14.086 --> 01:54:15.410]  Final segment with our guests.
[01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:20.243]  The entire third hour, we'll open the phones up for active duty, but also veterans.
[01:54:22.097 --> 01:54:32.324]  And I do this every few weeks on particular national security issues to get their take, because they're the ones that are going to be sent in until the robots replace them, the autonomous systems.
[01:54:33.145 --> 01:54:45.013]  And I want to know their take on the fact that Assad's come out, and this article's going up on Infowars.com in minutes, Kit Daniels did it, off of Assad's statements that nobody's picking up, that we are a sovereign nation fighting Al Qaeda.
[01:54:45.373 --> 01:54:46.594]  And that's it, over 100,000 injected by the West.
[01:54:48.035 --> 01:54:50.697]  I'm not a fan of Assad or Qaddafi or any of these guys.
[01:54:51.137 --> 01:54:58.461]  But the point is that they're trying to replace one corrupt system that's not offensive and that is democratizing with something far worse.
[01:54:59.382 --> 01:55:04.285]  And as Dr. Corsi said earlier in the hour, many analysts say this could turn into World War III.
[01:55:05.325 --> 01:55:06.326]  And here's the BBC.
[01:55:07.146 --> 01:55:08.007]  Syria crisis.
[01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:11.430]  Russia and China step up warning over strike.
[01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:18.094]  Russia and China have stepped up their warning against military intervention in Syria and Moscow saying any such action would have catastrophic consequences.
[01:55:18.455 --> 01:55:21.197]  Their foreign minister likened the West to a monkey with a hand grenade.
[01:55:21.437 --> 01:55:22.818]  How about a monkey with nuclear weapons?
[01:55:23.979 --> 01:55:28.662]  And again, I've had Syrian opposition on people that live in other countries that are famous.
[01:55:29.583 --> 01:55:30.764]  Like Bibi, the Syrian girl.
[01:55:30.784 --> 01:55:32.285]  You know, his dad was like one of the top ministers.
[01:55:33.246 --> 01:55:35.547]  They hate Assad and say he's 10 times better than Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:36.527 --> 01:55:40.128]  They were run out of the country and they're against this because this is evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:40.468 --> 01:55:46.029]  And now the evidence, the Muslim extremists shot video of themselves loading the chemical weapon mortars.
[01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:49.230]  I'm predicted it'd be mortars, that's what those attacks look like.
[01:55:49.730 --> 01:55:50.531]  That's how they deployed it.
[01:55:51.171 --> 01:55:54.091]  I mean, that's why Kerry's saying, doesn't matter who did it, now we've got to invade.
[01:55:54.111 --> 01:55:54.752]  This is incredible.
[01:55:56.505 --> 01:55:59.051]  This segues into the bombshell he was just dropping.
[01:55:59.352 --> 01:56:02.640]  These statements when he goes to these conferences, they're like, we'll just start a new war.
[01:56:03.906 --> 01:56:12.952]  Our money, the tens of trillions we've spent turning into an empire, has taken us from the greatest saving nation to now the greatest debtor nation.
[01:56:14.573 --> 01:56:18.516]  These guys that have jobs, sure they've got jobs, but it sucks our economy dry.
[01:56:19.216 --> 01:56:21.918]  These Pentagon jobs are not good.
[01:56:21.978 --> 01:56:23.639]  These defense contractor jobs are not good.
[01:56:23.939 --> 01:56:31.564]  And now it's shifting these big companies, the robot companies, and they sold Austin like $15 million worth this year, three $5 million robots.
[01:56:33.041 --> 01:56:33.722]  And I looked them up.
[01:56:33.742 --> 01:56:36.245]  The robots don't even cost, really, $500,000 to build.
[01:56:36.826 --> 01:56:41.551]  In closing, sir, I mean, this is about the military-industrial complex run rampant for me.
[01:56:42.533 --> 01:56:48.380]  What is your final points, Dr. Noel Sharkey, and how do people visit your campaign against killer robots to learn more?
[01:56:49.212 --> 01:56:58.537]  Well, I've given you the links, I've given your producer the links, so he's going to put them on your website, which will lead you to the right place to find out about this.
[01:56:58.837 --> 01:57:10.304]  But one thing it's worth saying, apart from the big industrial military complex and all this nonsense about jobs, it's really putting money in certain people's pockets, a lot of money, and that's what really is behind it.
[01:57:10.604 --> 01:57:15.627]  But one thing that people keep saying is, but surely robots are good, they'll lead to bloodless wars.
[01:57:16.067 --> 01:57:18.168]  Well, that's really not thinking at all.
[01:57:18.228 --> 01:57:23.411]  That's the usual blinkered thing that a lot of your United States lawyers come up with all the time.
[01:57:23.692 --> 01:57:24.692]  Oh, this would be great.
[01:57:24.932 --> 01:57:26.233]  We can have bloodless conflicts.
[01:57:26.413 --> 01:57:32.317]  Well, the problem is that there's been a continuous conflict almost, as far as I can see, since the Second World War.
[01:57:32.737 --> 01:57:34.938]  And this is not going to alleviate it at all.
[01:57:35.258 --> 01:57:37.780]  It just means you can carry on with low level
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:43.203]  Of killing people constantly, all the time, if they're against your nation's interests.
[01:57:43.603 --> 01:57:46.505]  And people talk about, you know, you don't have to commit troops.
[01:57:46.905 --> 01:57:47.545]  Well, I'm sorry.
[01:57:47.945 --> 01:57:51.147]  But, you know, I don't want to see any young men being killed.
[01:57:51.207 --> 01:57:53.228]  I have friends fighting in Afghanistan.
[01:57:53.588 --> 01:58:00.292]  But without the threat of body bags coming home, it's very easy just to continue killing and killing and killing.
[01:58:00.492 --> 01:58:10.374]  And I think you laid out the big, giant key there, is this just allows us to sit here and watch football while our robot armies kill everybody, and it's not even in American interest.
[01:58:11.394 --> 01:58:18.216]  I mean, it is so immoral and cowardly to give, you know, higher than Purple Heart awards to the drone pilots.
[01:58:18.516 --> 01:58:20.176]  Oh yeah, that was a good one.
[01:58:21.257 --> 01:58:22.897]  Why don't we give them peace prizes like Obama?
[01:58:24.957 --> 01:58:28.620]  I think that every drone pilot should get an Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:30.462]  That would fit well with what you're saying.
[01:58:31.523 --> 01:58:32.263]  Wow, okay.
[01:58:32.283 --> 01:58:38.449]  We've had your website up on screen for folks to visit and we'll post it up on InfoWars.com and links and everything you're doing.
[01:58:38.669 --> 01:58:40.270]  But Professor, thank you so much.
[01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:42.112]  Dr. Noel Sharkey, thank you so much.
[01:58:42.132 --> 01:58:42.832]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:58:43.373 --> 01:58:44.674]  Thank you for all your help, Alex.
[01:58:44.894 --> 01:58:46.896]  Oh no, thank you for fighting for humanity's future.
[01:58:46.916 --> 01:58:47.837]  Third Hour coming up.
[01:58:49.727 --> 01:58:52.596]  We're going to cover the big serious situation straight ahead.
[01:58:52.937 --> 01:58:53.860]  Huge developments.
[01:58:54.522 --> 01:58:55.745]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:55.805 --> 01:58:56.247]  Stay with us.
[01:58:56.287 --> 01:58:57.330]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:59.201 --> 01:59:00.842]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:59:01.102 --> 01:59:04.604]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:59:04.744 --> 01:59:09.147]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:59:09.307 --> 01:59:15.271]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:59:15.391 --> 01:59:26.177]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:59:26.377 --> 01:59:32.684]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:59:32.864 --> 01:59:47.619]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[01:59:47.819 --> 01:59:49.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.854 --> 02:00:18.037]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:18.698 --> 02:00:19.499]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.279 --> 02:00:21.200]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:25.443]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.024 --> 02:00:30.087]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:48.379 --> 02:00:54.061]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the third hour and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:54.601 --> 02:00:58.542]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to recap the latest bombshell developments.
[02:00:59.222 --> 02:01:16.527]  We also have a clip from last night with John Kerry and his statement about how, well first off he said there's no doubt Assad did the chemical weapons, but later he says it doesn't matter who really launched the chemicals, we can't allow a country to have
[02:01:17.623 --> 02:01:19.464]  These chemicals, so the UN must go in.
[02:01:19.504 --> 02:01:20.544]  So it's globalism.
[02:01:20.564 --> 02:01:22.005]  We're going to attack you for peace.
[02:01:22.966 --> 02:01:25.827]  And we're going to bring in rebels to do it and go after your legal weapons.
[02:01:26.287 --> 02:01:28.908]  And I've got a transcript that I'm going to be going over as well.
[02:01:28.928 --> 02:01:33.330]  We have the video as well with Carney saying this is not regime change.
[02:01:34.031 --> 02:01:37.452]  In fact, that's the London Guardian with the transcript of that.
[02:01:38.313 --> 02:01:44.736]  Carney, of course, famously a few months ago said that they're launching non-lethal lethal operations.
[02:01:45.803 --> 02:01:46.744]  in different parts of the world.
[02:01:46.804 --> 02:01:48.406]  So it's non-lethal lethal.
[02:01:49.306 --> 02:01:55.152]  So kill your neighbor, hypothetically, beat their brains out, and the cops show up and go, it's non-lethal lethal.
[02:01:55.972 --> 02:01:56.713]  I'm Jay Carney.
[02:01:57.173 --> 02:01:58.515]  Heck, wear a Jay Carney suit.
[02:01:58.835 --> 02:02:05.881]  Look like a punk class president who you wouldn't trust, you know, to water your plants when you're out of town.
[02:02:05.901 --> 02:02:11.666]  I mean, you take one look at Carney, he is an arrogant, narcissistic, full-of-himself jackass criminal.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:30.011]  And I want to say this, all the liars that work for this regime, and all the media whores at CNN, MSNBC, you know who you are, who go along with all this warmongering, and the conservative talk show host, that know full well what's going on, and say we've got to attack Syria, you're the scum of the earth, and you are complicit in these war crimes.
[02:02:30.432 --> 02:02:34.134]  Good job for Dr. Corsi and WorldNetDaily coming out against us and saying it's a fraud.
[02:02:34.534 --> 02:02:37.216]  Good job for DrudgeReport posting the article showing it's a fraud.
[02:02:37.657 --> 02:02:40.839]  Good job for Pat Buchanan coming out
[02:02:41.713 --> 02:02:42.654]  I'm saying this is a fraud.
[02:02:43.334 --> 02:02:44.515]  Good job to InfoWars.
[02:02:45.515 --> 02:02:47.476]  Because, you know, we stand on the right side of history.
[02:02:47.556 --> 02:02:50.558]  Assad is no angel cake, but compared to his dad he is.
[02:02:51.378 --> 02:02:57.462]  He was a stabilizing force in the region, and he was trying to democratize, and they used that to be able to infiltrate and start this up.
[02:02:59.266 --> 02:03:00.546]  Makes his dad's point, doesn't it?
[02:03:00.566 --> 02:03:01.927]  That's the problem.
[02:03:01.947 --> 02:03:06.809]  The globalists always introduce instability, which then helps dictators stay in power worldwide.
[02:03:07.429 --> 02:03:11.851]  The globalists want dictatorship because they can centralize control through it.
[02:03:12.751 --> 02:03:18.893]  And you're going to find out in the coming months and years, the men from the boys, who cares about humanity, who values the truth.
[02:03:19.133 --> 02:03:23.975]  Like Dr. Corsi said, he is a famous conservative, pretty much a neocon.
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:35.709]  And there he is, having to admit these wars have been fraudulent and have bankrupted us, and that the Al-Qaeda rebels are run by the White House, and there's videos of them staging the chemical attack.
[02:03:36.710 --> 02:03:39.093]  And he goes, Assad's bad, but the truth's the truth.
[02:03:39.413 --> 02:03:39.933]  Exactly!
[02:03:40.394 --> 02:03:41.174]  The truth is the truth.
[02:03:41.214 --> 02:03:45.678]  It isn't about, well, he's a bad guy, so let's do something, let's be conservative.
[02:03:45.698 --> 02:03:46.499]  500 times worse?
[02:03:49.741 --> 02:03:51.983]  To say he's ten times worse, no!
[02:03:52.723 --> 02:04:04.893]  You could go to Syria and go to the beach and hang out and go to movies and women could go to college and Jews and Christians could live in peace and unless you were a radical, violent Islamic group, you could have freedom in that country.
[02:04:06.474 --> 02:04:13.619]  The anger against Assad is just like here, the government gives contracts to crony insiders.
[02:04:13.859 --> 02:04:14.640]  That's the tyranny!
[02:04:15.481 --> 02:04:16.682]  It's that just like in Egypt,
[02:04:17.677 --> 02:04:21.598]  Haji Mubarak gave contracts to his buddies and screwed over taxpayers.
[02:04:21.738 --> 02:04:23.158]  This is exactly what our government's doing.
[02:04:23.698 --> 02:04:29.160]  And notice, only 9% of Americans, 91% are against this war.
[02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:35.901]  91% in the major Reuters poll that's out, and they don't care.
[02:04:35.921 --> 02:04:37.161]  They go ahead with it.
[02:04:40.273 --> 02:04:43.014]  I mean, are we going to have somebody invade us because we've got a corrupt government?
[02:04:43.435 --> 02:04:45.435]  And then blow the country up like they're doing us a favor?
[02:04:45.736 --> 02:04:46.436]  No thanks!
[02:04:47.116 --> 02:04:48.057]  No thanks.
[02:04:48.577 --> 02:04:51.018]  I don't want any foreign governments to invade to kick out Obama.
[02:04:51.298 --> 02:04:52.439]  It's the same type of deal.
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:57.201]  But Obama is at war with logic and truth.
[02:04:57.861 --> 02:05:00.363]  Assad comes out and just says, what about the logic?
[02:05:00.783 --> 02:05:02.344]  The article's up on Infowars.com.
[02:05:02.384 --> 02:05:03.004]  It's red-linked.
[02:05:03.404 --> 02:05:07.006]  Assad says Syria is a sovereign country fighting al-Qaeda.
[02:05:09.212 --> 02:05:20.380]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.

[02:07:09.193 --> 02:07:13.776]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?

[02:07:30.827 --> 02:07:34.810]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:37.372]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:07:37.612 --> 02:07:43.536]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:08:25.313 --> 02:08:29.257]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:30.898 --> 02:08:33.240]  We're all riders on the storm, my friends.
[02:08:34.441 --> 02:08:35.762]  Into this world we're born.
[02:08:35.782 --> 02:08:38.104]  Into this world we're thrown.
[02:08:42.608 --> 02:08:54.396]  Let me just recap the top headlines and new developments that I'm going to give the number out for active duty or retired Special Forces troops, particularly who've recently retired, to give us your take on this.
[02:08:54.456 --> 02:09:08.886]  It's on record for almost three years now, it's over two and a half years, they've been funding Al Qaeda mainly, 60% it's estimated by the Council on Foreign Relations, to invade out of Iraq, out of Jordan, and out of Turkey.
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:12.061]  No one knows the numbers.
[02:09:12.081 --> 02:09:15.325]  There's as many as 60,000 at any one time in the country.
[02:09:15.365 --> 02:09:20.389]  They believe it's over 200,000 have been injected in the last two and a half years.
[02:09:21.811 --> 02:09:22.832]  And they're given U.S.
[02:09:22.892 --> 02:09:26.636]  weapons, you name it, German weapons, Dutch weapons, British weapons.
[02:09:27.296 --> 02:09:28.637]  They're now being given U.S.
[02:09:28.698 --> 02:09:35.044]  TOW missiles, heat-seeking missiles, French anti-aircraft missiles, that's the heat-seekers they've got mainly.
[02:09:36.383 --> 02:09:40.993]  And now, you'll notice now, they're telling police departments, get ready for Al Qaeda to shoot down aircraft with heat seekers.
[02:09:42.492 --> 02:09:45.174]  And they won't even care when they shoot down our aircraft later.
[02:09:45.214 --> 02:09:47.935]  That traitor Alex says our government gave it to them.
[02:09:48.115 --> 02:09:49.436]  When it's on record, they did.
[02:09:49.776 --> 02:09:52.258]  See, being a traitor is being informed.
[02:09:52.918 --> 02:09:54.819]  Being a traitor is loving America.
[02:09:55.079 --> 02:09:56.520]  Being a traitor is loving justice.
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:58.381]  Being a traitor is loving the truth.
[02:09:59.442 --> 02:10:02.944]  Being a traitor is being an American against the globalist occupation of this country.
[02:10:03.484 --> 02:10:07.126]  And Obama wants a big giant distraction from everything that's happening.
[02:10:09.170 --> 02:10:18.680]  The IRS gate, the NSA gate, the persecution of the pro-life groups, the Benghazi gate, the Fast and Furious gate, and all the new stuff.
[02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:23.005]  The Muslim Brotherhood is coming out, being funded directly by Obama and his family.
[02:10:23.045 --> 02:10:25.348]  He's like making money, using covert money.
[02:10:26.687 --> 02:10:29.488]  To then give his family large positions in the Middle East?
[02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:31.329]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:10:31.349 --> 02:10:40.774]  It's like LBJ himself reportedly made over $500 million just on the dredging of one area off the coast of South Vietnam to bring in ships.
[02:10:41.494 --> 02:10:42.655]  And that was back in the 60s.
[02:10:43.455 --> 02:10:44.876]  He made $500 million off that.
[02:10:46.297 --> 02:10:52.620]  I mean, it's just the President personally is in there doing this, and he smiles at his idiot followers.
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:55.161]  But the good news is, this is bombshell.
[02:10:56.189 --> 02:11:01.850]  Major Reuters poll out, and I'm going to dig through it here and show TV viewers the actual Washington Post headline.
[02:11:03.190 --> 02:11:06.591]  The headline is, U.S.
[02:11:08.151 --> 02:11:13.872]  intervention in Syrian war less popular than Congress, is the headline.
[02:11:14.912 --> 02:11:15.512]  I'm going from memory.
[02:11:15.552 --> 02:11:16.212]  I'll pull it out here.
[02:11:16.232 --> 02:11:16.833]  There it is.
[02:11:16.873 --> 02:11:17.253]  New poll.
[02:11:17.293 --> 02:11:19.233]  Syrian intervention even less popular than Congress.
[02:11:19.933 --> 02:11:20.633]  Washington Post.
[02:11:22.113 --> 02:11:23.814]  Folks, it's already an intervention.
[02:11:24.014 --> 02:11:25.414]  Our dirty, evil government
[02:11:26.593 --> 02:11:27.374]  Did the whole thing.
[02:11:27.414 --> 02:11:28.575]  And I want to explain something here.
[02:11:28.595 --> 02:11:31.898]  People say, well, how do you dislike the corrupt government but say you love our military?
[02:11:32.219 --> 02:11:33.960]  Our military is the most awake group I know.
[02:11:34.601 --> 02:11:35.962]  They're good men and women on average.
[02:11:36.343 --> 02:11:37.424]  They're awake, folks.
[02:11:38.843 --> 02:11:49.527]  It's like if your plane got hijacked by a hijacker and they put on the captain's uniform, which they a lot of times do because of psychological reasons, people tend to stop resisting just because they're in the uniform.
[02:11:49.987 --> 02:11:57.430]  We have criminals in the uniform of the president, the commander-in-chief, the leader of the Senate, the leader of the House.
[02:11:57.730 --> 02:12:01.272]  They're all globalists who themselves are out of control.
[02:12:02.412 --> 02:12:06.474]  I've studied criminology, I've studied megalomania, studying history,
[02:12:07.356 --> 02:12:11.299]  And you get the Roman Empire, the Babylonian Empire, Mesoamerican Empires, you name it.
[02:12:11.659 --> 02:12:13.160]  When do they always go into decline?
[02:12:14.281 --> 02:12:24.288]  You'll have some king that comes from a line of people that was, you know, tough, strong, focused, intelligent, was into art, literature, building up society, building aqueducts.
[02:12:24.308 --> 02:12:25.408]  It's the same story everywhere.
[02:12:25.829 --> 02:12:28.711]  And things thrive, population grows, there's good rule.
[02:12:29.511 --> 02:12:42.401]  Everybody gets happy, then his grandson's kind of a punk, but he gets into power 50 years later, and is arrogant, and puts some corrupt people in, and gets a little jealous of some other folks that have some money, so he shuts them down.
[02:12:42.702 --> 02:12:48.446]  He decides to conquer some neighbors that they've been trading with for a long time, and that shuts down that productivity.
[02:12:48.466 --> 02:12:57.734]  And then they start conquering other neighbors and looting the peasants, you know, with 80% tax rates to be able to fund the new wars, and then he'll... and then his own guard turns against him.
[02:12:58.857 --> 02:13:10.409]  So he brings in mercenaries to oppress them, and then he has a spoiled rotten son that gets control, who likes to chain children up in the town square and chew their throats out in front of everyone.
[02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:12.951]  That was a common thing for some reason.
[02:13:13.232 --> 02:13:19.899]  Nero, was it Nero or Caligula that dressed up like a werewolf and would chain up the children in the banquet hall and rip their throats out nightly?
[02:13:19.919 --> 02:13:20.839]  I think it was Nero.
[02:13:21.903 --> 02:13:23.304]  Yeah, it was Nero, it wasn't Caligula.
[02:13:24.004 --> 02:13:25.445]  I mean, you can look that up, by the way.
[02:13:25.886 --> 02:13:28.728]  And it doesn't matter whether it was the Aztecs or the Romans.
[02:13:29.288 --> 02:13:35.132]  Finally, you know, Vlad the Impaler, I think it was his granddaughter, would bathe in the blood of babies.
[02:13:35.172 --> 02:13:39.395]  They would chop their heads off and spew the blood onto her because she thought it made her look younger.
[02:13:39.895 --> 02:13:41.496]  That's, by the way, archaeology.
[02:13:41.516 --> 02:13:42.156]  They've dug that up.
[02:13:42.196 --> 02:13:42.737]  That's true.
[02:13:44.366 --> 02:13:47.227]  Bring in the peasant baby, chop its head off, and spray the blood on me.
[02:13:47.807 --> 02:13:49.248]  This is what we've allowed.
[02:13:49.288 --> 02:13:51.008]  It's like Hitler, Stalin, or Mao.
[02:13:51.369 --> 02:14:01.032]  We just have absolute ravenous scum of the earth in control that want to destroy themselves subconsciously.
[02:14:03.273 --> 02:14:05.754]  Look at what a degenerate Nero looks like.
[02:14:06.194 --> 02:14:07.215]  I mean, look at that.
[02:14:07.235 --> 02:14:13.457]  I mean, he looks, look how crazed on a power trip he looks.
[02:14:15.014 --> 02:14:17.176]  Those Romans could really get it down to what they look like.
[02:14:17.196 --> 02:14:18.437]  Look at that psycho demon.
[02:14:19.358 --> 02:14:20.679]  He finally committed suicide.
[02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:21.460]  He was so decadent.
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:24.042]  He said, I've murdered my family, burned the city down.
[02:14:24.062 --> 02:14:26.844]  The only thing I can do that's more evil is kill myself.
[02:14:27.885 --> 02:14:28.306]  Look it up.
[02:14:29.847 --> 02:14:31.989]  That's what Lenin said.
[02:14:33.090 --> 02:14:33.771]  He wrote poetry.
[02:14:33.791 --> 02:14:34.331]  You can pull it up.
[02:14:34.631 --> 02:14:36.273]  He said, I'd like to take over the planet.
[02:14:37.583 --> 02:14:44.669]  And create weapons systems, and he talked about scientists that had theorized by 1900 atomic weapons, but this was in the 30s.
[02:14:45.330 --> 02:14:46.931]  He said, I'd like to blow up the earth.
[02:14:47.051 --> 02:14:48.472]  No, blow up the sun.
[02:14:48.532 --> 02:14:49.553]  No, blow up everything.
[02:14:50.634 --> 02:14:52.455]  And he said, my dream is to kill everybody.
[02:14:54.717 --> 02:14:57.059]  And he would go to a little island.
[02:14:57.079 --> 02:14:59.742]  This is actually, Clint Eastwood put this in one of his movies.
[02:15:00.855 --> 02:15:04.517]  A breakdown of it, where a crazy hillbilly is killing white rabbits.
[02:15:04.777 --> 02:15:07.959]  And I always saw that and wondered, what does that mean?
[02:15:08.039 --> 02:15:08.839]  Where would you come up with that?
[02:15:08.859 --> 02:15:13.761]  And later I learned, oh, he had a private island where they would stock thousands of white rabbits.
[02:15:14.482 --> 02:15:20.245]  They would run around with guns and hatchets just for like eight hours straight, biting them, ripping their heads off, flopping around on the ground.
[02:15:20.265 --> 02:15:27.168]  I mean, I'm sorry to... What's that movie with bridges that Clint Eastwood did?
[02:15:27.248 --> 02:15:29.049]  It's Lightfoot and something.
[02:15:30.478 --> 02:15:31.458]  No, it's not the bridges.
[02:15:32.819 --> 02:15:33.959]  It's something in Lightfoot.
[02:15:35.379 --> 02:15:36.460]  The point is, it doesn't matter.
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:39.180]  That's based off what Lennon would do.
[02:15:40.761 --> 02:15:46.162]  And we're going to give these people nuclear weapons and everything and Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.
[02:15:46.182 --> 02:15:46.602]  There you go.
[02:15:49.223 --> 02:15:54.465]  And that's the type of issue that we're facing here.
[02:15:55.905 --> 02:15:58.446]  And these same people
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:04.645]  are going to have to stand up and take action against the psychopaths before they destroy the world.
[02:16:04.865 --> 02:16:12.431]  Because in the old days, the tyrants would run their course and collapse finally, and then the barbarians would come in and take over the primitives, and then society would start back over again.
[02:16:12.732 --> 02:16:14.994]  This time, that's not going to happen with the technocracy.
[02:16:15.474 --> 02:16:18.737]  They're going to do things to humanity the world has never seen before.
[02:16:20.559 --> 02:16:23.862]  You wonder, why do they put fluoride in the water when they know it increases cancer and brain damages?
[02:16:24.162 --> 02:16:26.324]  Well, they've all written white papers like the White House science czar.
[02:16:27.714 --> 02:16:30.177]  He wants you to be dumbed down so he can control you.
[02:16:30.738 --> 02:16:34.722]  They get off on walking through the mall or down the street looking at all their victims.
[02:16:34.782 --> 02:16:35.563]  It's a power trip.
[02:16:35.883 --> 02:16:37.886]  Well, let me tell you something, you pieces of crap.
[02:16:38.607 --> 02:16:42.171]  I see you, and I know who you are, and I know what you are.
[02:16:43.492 --> 02:16:48.117]  And I am here to try to ignite the spirit of liberty, and I can feel it already happening, and you will pay.
[02:16:49.215 --> 02:16:50.576]  You will be defeated.
[02:16:50.696 --> 02:17:00.082]  I am not going to stand by, and God is not going to stand by, and the American people and the rest of the planet that loves justice is not going to stand by and watch you filth run rampant anymore.
[02:17:00.603 --> 02:17:05.946]  Every stinking false flag they've pulled, they've gotten over 70% approval ratings to go into countries.
[02:17:06.186 --> 02:17:07.327]  But people now know.
[02:17:07.908 --> 02:17:10.749]  So they've pulled conservatives, libertarians, liberals, you name it.
[02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:15.092]  The average is 9% support your new fraud.
[02:17:15.312 --> 02:17:19.155]  That's why Kerry yesterday said, I want you to look at the images of these
[02:17:19.155 --> 02:17:19.855]  These dead children.
[02:17:20.376 --> 02:17:42.627]  And I want you to understand how horrible it is, and that I'm sitting there watching it, and wondering why I got probably more angry than I ever had in my life, looking at this sack of arrogant, narcissistic garbage, drunk on the blood of innocents, in his fancy suit, threatening us that are awake, going, and how dare those of you claim that the rebels, that Assad didn't do this.
[02:17:43.608 --> 02:17:45.709]  And then he later says, but it doesn't matter who did it.
[02:17:46.633 --> 02:17:49.354]  And then he goes on to say, uh, it doesn't matter either.
[02:17:49.374 --> 02:17:50.515]  We have to go in and get the weapons.
[02:17:50.875 --> 02:17:53.217]  Knowing full well it's going to come out the rebels did it.
[02:17:53.737 --> 02:17:54.797]  And who commands them?
[02:17:55.038 --> 02:17:57.799]  The State Department's running this illegal operation outside Congress.
[02:17:58.039 --> 02:17:58.499]  That's come out.
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:17:59.640]  And who heads up the State Department?
[02:18:00.140 --> 02:18:02.061]  You're looking at the guy that did it!
[02:18:02.682 --> 02:18:07.784]  The UN investigation will not determine who used these chemical weapons.
[02:18:07.865 --> 02:18:08.125]  See?
[02:18:08.645 --> 02:18:11.446]  Only whether such weapons were used.
[02:18:12.347 --> 02:18:15.649]  A judgment that is already clear to the world.
[02:18:16.867 --> 02:18:18.228]  I spoke on Thursday.
[02:18:18.288 --> 02:18:20.329]  Now he goes on to talk about the children and everything else.
[02:18:20.909 --> 02:18:22.970]  I did the whole thing on the news last night and talked over it.
[02:18:25.191 --> 02:18:27.192]  I could hardly walk out of here last night.
[02:18:27.292 --> 02:18:29.353]  I was so freaked out and so exhausted.
[02:18:29.373 --> 02:18:30.034]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:18:30.274 --> 02:18:32.275]  People say, man, why are you angry?
[02:18:32.595 --> 02:18:33.416]  Why am I angry?
[02:18:33.516 --> 02:18:43.681]  My government is hijacked and run by an Ivy League piece of trash, an arrogant frat boy scumbag, a Nero wannabe,
[02:18:45.259 --> 02:18:46.680]  In America's name!
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:54.586]  I mean, when my children get older, if they ever came, if the police ever came and it turned out one of my children done something horrible, I would feel terrible about it.
[02:18:54.986 --> 02:18:57.348]  Because it's in my name, and it means I failed.
[02:18:58.309 --> 02:19:03.433]  And it's the same thing, I have failed, we've all failed, we've got this disgusting trash
[02:19:04.409 --> 02:19:08.571]  Butchering our country, waging war on us, saying veterans are the number one terror threat.
[02:19:09.151 --> 02:19:11.493]  George Washington is bad in the Army Manual.
[02:19:11.733 --> 02:19:13.914]  I mean, I can't even believe I'm saying that.
[02:19:13.954 --> 02:19:14.814]  It's so over the top.
[02:19:15.014 --> 02:19:16.595]  These people are the enemy.
[02:19:18.336 --> 02:19:25.199]  And the fact that I'm on over 160 stations and reach 15 million people a week shows America still got a chance to fix ourselves like Nineveh.
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:29.922]  To get that reprieve before judgment comes down on us.
[02:19:31.303 --> 02:19:33.804]  But I'm here to tell you, right now,
[02:19:35.834 --> 02:19:47.019]  Just as Jonah warned Nineveh, those of us that have been warning people about what's happening, America is going to go into full bondage and hell on earth if we continue to allow these people to rule over us.
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:48.880]  We are going under judgment.
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:50.041]  How does God judge people?
[02:19:50.521 --> 02:19:54.703]  Read about Israel, when the prophets would tell them, you're going to be judged.
[02:19:54.743 --> 02:19:56.204]  You're going to be allowed to go into captivity.
[02:19:56.844 --> 02:19:58.945]  When you become evil, you judge yourself.
[02:19:59.005 --> 02:20:00.546]  You let the evil take over.
[02:20:01.026 --> 02:20:02.607]  They're not going to stop at Syria.
[02:20:02.807 --> 02:20:03.988]  They're not going to stop anywhere.
[02:20:04.708 --> 02:20:06.349]  You think they hate Syrians?
[02:20:06.570 --> 02:20:08.491]  They really hate Americans, the globalists!
[02:20:09.352 --> 02:20:10.532]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:10.793 --> 02:20:21.240]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:24.923]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the terrorists.
[02:20:24.963 --> 02:20:25.263]  I think so.
[02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:43.201]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:20:43.401 --> 02:20:49.043]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:49.563 --> 02:20:59.045]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:20:59.445 --> 02:21:00.626]  The war is here.
[02:21:00.946 --> 02:21:02.366]  It's an info war.
[02:21:02.846 --> 02:21:05.527]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:09.847 --> 02:21:16.796]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[02:21:17.356 --> 02:21:20.440]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[02:21:21.061 --> 02:21:26.868]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[02:21:27.725 --> 02:21:38.277]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[02:21:38.958 --> 02:21:43.122]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[02:21:43.863 --> 02:21:52.010]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[02:21:52.531 --> 02:21:55.954]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[02:21:56.374 --> 02:21:58.336]  It's something much darker.
[02:21:58.837 --> 02:22:04.121]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[02:22:04.522 --> 02:22:05.863]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[02:22:08.715 --> 02:22:14.618]  Did you know there are 3 million edible food plants on Earth and none have the nutritional value of the hemp plant?
[02:22:14.678 --> 02:22:17.579]  HempUSA.org offers you Hemp Protein Powder.

[02:22:38.470 --> 02:22:47.716]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:47.776 --> 02:22:48.517]  This capitalism?
[02:22:48.577 --> 02:22:54.701]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:54.741 --> 02:22:58.383]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:22:58.443 --> 02:22:59.364]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.384 --> 02:23:00.705]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:23:00.765 --> 02:23:01.045]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.085 --> 02:23:01.365]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:08.390 --> 02:23:18.592]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[02:23:18.952 --> 02:23:22.753]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[02:23:23.113 --> 02:23:36.296]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[02:23:36.616 --> 02:23:38.578]  It can even purify water!
[02:23:38.978 --> 02:23:43.662]  Supernatural Silver comes in both liquid and gel for internal or external use.
[02:23:43.983 --> 02:23:55.173]  With over 180 scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, research institutions, and nursing homes, Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against disease.

[02:24:14.558 --> 02:24:19.825]  Yeah, and it could cause World War III.
[02:24:20.065 --> 02:24:26.893]  It's called Open Bombardment of Syria by NATO and the United States, run by Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[02:24:26.913 --> 02:24:32.019]  Morgan on record, with the Russians and the Chinese on the other side.
[02:24:33.643 --> 02:24:35.445]  And the globalists, of course, have funded them as well.
[02:24:36.065 --> 02:24:39.448]  They'll just sit back and make money out of the disaster, out of the crisis.
[02:24:39.548 --> 02:24:40.249]  And here's the deal.
[02:24:40.349 --> 02:24:42.211]  Iran says they're going to line up behind Syria.
[02:24:42.671 --> 02:24:44.253]  People really hate Iran.
[02:24:44.333 --> 02:24:51.039]  So see, that's what Obama's counting on, is that once Iran attacks or they'll attack Israel, then it's like, well, we got to be for it now.
[02:24:52.335 --> 02:24:57.157]  So you attack people and you push them into it, and then they know Americans will just get behind it.
[02:24:57.617 --> 02:24:59.238]  And of course he thinks it's going to happen.
[02:24:59.718 --> 02:25:07.161]  I'm going to open the phones up after Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us for just 10 minutes of the next segment to give us his take for a few military people to join us on air.
[02:25:07.181 --> 02:25:09.061]  You can start calling now if you can hold 15-20 minutes, but 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:25:17.279 --> 02:25:21.201]  But Syria crisis, Russia and China step up warning over strike.
[02:25:21.221 --> 02:25:22.302]  That's BBC.
[02:25:22.802 --> 02:25:25.043]  Dr. Corsi, this is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:25:25.464 --> 02:25:27.265]  Syria gas attack, work of U.S.
[02:25:27.445 --> 02:25:27.925]  allies.
[02:25:28.585 --> 02:25:30.467]  They got the videos of it, and the group's bragging.
[02:25:31.727 --> 02:25:32.668]  Oh yeah.
[02:25:32.728 --> 02:25:35.729]  New polls, Syria intervention even less popular than Congress, 9%.
[02:25:35.850 --> 02:25:45.135]  Al Zahari, the leader of Al Qaeda, praises what the West is doing, helping the rebels, and says Damascus first, then Cairo, then Jerusalem.
[02:25:46.297 --> 02:25:46.998]  I mean, who knows?
[02:25:47.078 --> 02:25:49.500]  Maybe Obama will end up supporting the Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:54.223]  I guess they are supporting the attack on Cairo, but how about they call them protesters on CNN and activists.
[02:25:54.604 --> 02:25:57.226]  How about calling them activists and people when they attack Jerusalem?
[02:25:57.986 --> 02:25:58.367]  Who knows?
[02:25:58.427 --> 02:25:59.347]  I've seen stranger things.
[02:25:59.367 --> 02:26:00.288]  They might actually support that.
[02:26:01.629 --> 02:26:04.752]  Continuing, international... I'll be a traitor for not supporting that, I guess.
[02:26:06.073 --> 02:26:06.893]  I don't like Al-Qaeda.
[02:26:06.913 --> 02:26:07.354]  I'll admit it.
[02:26:07.394 --> 02:26:08.214]  I guess I'm a bad man.
[02:26:08.755 --> 02:26:10.136]  International pressure heats up.
[02:26:10.216 --> 02:26:10.816]  Hagel, U.S.
[02:26:10.856 --> 02:26:12.418]  ready to strike Syria immediately.
[02:26:13.414 --> 02:26:16.235]  On and on and on.
[02:26:16.295 --> 02:26:18.136]  Military strikes as early as Thursday.
[02:26:18.256 --> 02:26:18.456]  U.S.
[02:26:18.496 --> 02:26:18.897]  officials.
[02:26:19.377 --> 02:26:19.997]  NBC.
[02:26:20.457 --> 02:26:21.878]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[02:26:21.938 --> 02:26:24.839]  The Dow drops by 1% amid worries over Syria.
[02:26:26.980 --> 02:26:28.501]  This is the type of stuff we're dealing with.
[02:26:28.521 --> 02:26:30.682]  Let's go to the front page of Infowars.com.
[02:26:31.062 --> 02:26:32.523]  Assad says Syria.
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:36.222]  is a sovereign country fighting Al Qaeda.
[02:26:36.642 --> 02:26:38.203]  That's like saying the sky was blue today.
[02:26:38.684 --> 02:26:40.946]  So that article just went up on Infowars.com.
[02:26:41.326 --> 02:26:45.209]  Please get that article out to everyone you know.
[02:26:46.310 --> 02:26:52.254]  Saudis threaten Russia with Olympic terrorist attacks unless it abandons Syria's support.
[02:26:53.315 --> 02:26:53.956]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:26:53.996 --> 02:27:03.283]  The Saudi terrorist state that's helping supply the jihadis is openly saying they're going to attack Russia with proxy soldiers if they don't hand over Syria to them.
[02:27:04.005 --> 02:27:06.886]  It's the NATO, the degenerate Saudi leadership doing all this.
[02:27:07.007 --> 02:27:08.307]  I just, it's unbelievable, folks.
[02:27:08.807 --> 02:27:10.248]  I mean, our government's done some evil stuff before.
[02:27:10.288 --> 02:27:11.789]  This is just, just naked.
[02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:22.634]  And then they launch that nerve gas attack and get up there and talk about how they're humanitarians and blame it on other groups so they can kill hundreds of thousands more on the backs of a few hundred dead people they killed.
[02:27:23.935 --> 02:27:25.155]  And they know you have emotions.
[02:27:25.195 --> 02:27:25.916]  They're psychos.
[02:27:26.952 --> 02:27:28.072]  At least sociopaths.
[02:27:28.833 --> 02:27:30.833]  The only time they feel emotions is when they're doing something evil.
[02:27:31.393 --> 02:27:32.374]  That's what animates them.
[02:27:32.914 --> 02:27:34.154]  Study criminology, folks.
[02:27:34.174 --> 02:27:35.174]  You need to understand our enemy.
[02:27:35.754 --> 02:27:40.396]  Assad says Syria, again, is a sovereign country fighting al-Qaeda.
[02:27:40.496 --> 02:27:43.096]  Americans, 91% opposition to Syrian war.
[02:27:43.557 --> 02:27:47.678]  Insignificant to the technocrats, but it does show the mass awakening is happening.
[02:27:47.698 --> 02:27:48.578]  That is huge news.
[02:27:48.998 --> 02:27:52.019]  In your face, Miley Cyrus soft porn as Obama
[02:27:52.699 --> 02:27:54.160]  Prepares to murder Syrians.
[02:27:54.180 --> 02:28:02.844]  Yeah, I saw articles where it's more popular in the news and on Twitter about Miley Cyrus, again, who sold, you know, to the youth to try to corrupt them.
[02:28:03.244 --> 02:28:11.627]  And now she runs around bending over, simulating sex on TV, knowing everybody will pick up on it so she can sell more tickets.
[02:28:12.248 --> 02:28:13.728]  And again, if that's what you want to do, fine.
[02:28:14.449 --> 02:28:19.271]  My issue is, it shows the incredible immoralness that
[02:28:20.564 --> 02:28:23.086]  That Americans sure have woken up and are against another war.
[02:28:23.146 --> 02:28:24.947]  They know, they always lie about stuff, I don't believe them.
[02:28:25.247 --> 02:28:25.967]  But ask, so what?
[02:28:25.988 --> 02:28:27.308]  Let me see that girl bent over.
[02:28:28.369 --> 02:28:35.193]  And it's like, hey man, you're not going to have your pension funds, your job, NOTHING UNDER EVIL LIKE THIS YOU IDIOTS!
[02:28:37.034 --> 02:28:37.375]  Okay?
[02:28:38.888 --> 02:28:43.513]  You know, Democrats are like, yeah, I guess Obama's kind of out of control, but we still like him.
[02:28:43.533 --> 02:28:48.918]  Yeah, he'll be on Jay Leno talking about, well, hey, you got caught spying on people without warrants.
[02:28:48.958 --> 02:28:49.599]  You lied about that.
[02:28:49.979 --> 02:28:50.960]  But I'm for gay marriage.
[02:28:50.980 --> 02:28:53.503]  They're like, well, I guess it's like a throwaway thing.
[02:28:53.743 --> 02:28:54.604]  I'm for gay marriage.
[02:28:54.624 --> 02:28:56.386]  Just, hey, I caught you robbing the bank.
[02:28:56.886 --> 02:28:58.087]  I'm for gay marriage officers.
[02:28:58.147 --> 02:28:59.287]  Well, I guess that's okay then.
[02:28:59.608 --> 02:29:02.229]  It's just, it's just all these little petty distractions.
[02:29:02.269 --> 02:29:02.829]  Go on to break.
[02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:07.272]  Here's Summer Carney an hour ago with his bull at the White House press briefing.
[02:29:07.292 --> 02:29:10.234]  You don't need to go on a horse barn to find manure, folks.
[02:29:10.274 --> 02:29:11.274]  It comes out of this guy's mouth.
[02:29:11.314 --> 02:29:11.615]  Here it is.
[02:29:11.655 --> 02:29:24.002]  What I would say is that yesterday I made clear that the intelligence community is working on an assessment and that once we had that assessment we would provide information to the public about it.
[02:29:24.902 --> 02:29:30.265]  In the coming days, and that remains true, I think, that that speculation that it would come today... Just look at him!
[02:29:30.285 --> 02:29:31.086]  His body language!
[02:29:31.166 --> 02:29:31.706]  Total liar!
[02:29:31.726 --> 02:29:34.287]  Some other day, but it will come, and I think you can expect it this week.
[02:29:35.068 --> 02:29:47.495]  Let me also say, and I think that both Secretary Kerry and I attempted to make clear yesterday, that there is no doubt here that chemical weapons were used
[02:29:48.672 --> 02:29:49.653]  On a massive scale.
[02:29:49.713 --> 02:29:51.034]  See, see, we're gonna come back.
[02:29:51.134 --> 02:29:51.794]  On August 21st.
[02:29:51.835 --> 02:29:53.015]  But he repeats what Kerry said.
[02:29:53.075 --> 02:29:54.657]  It doesn't matter if Assad used it now.
[02:29:55.978 --> 02:29:58.380]  They can use chemical weapons anywhere they want, then invade you.
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:29:59.360]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.881 --> 02:30:00.882]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:00.902 --> 02:30:01.582]  See how beautiful that is?
[02:30:02.022 --> 02:30:02.583]  They're rebels.
[02:30:02.703 --> 02:30:04.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:04.544 --> 02:30:07.447]  You prove they did it, and it doesn't matter, then they invade you.

[02:31:12.123 --> 02:31:19.751]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:31:20.172 --> 02:31:24.837]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:31:25.097 --> 02:31:27.020]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:28.802]  If every one of us who can,
[02:31:29.142 --> 02:31:30.383]  We'll take care of ourselves.

[02:33:10.689 --> 02:33:15.751]  There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[02:33:15.851 --> 02:33:21.254]  Even when the set is turned off, look around at the environment we live in.
[02:33:21.334 --> 02:33:25.776]  Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.
[02:33:25.876 --> 02:33:29.698]  The Earth is being acclimatized.
[02:33:29.778 --> 02:33:33.799]  They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
[02:33:34.460 --> 02:33:36.761]  We are like a natural resource to them.
[02:33:37.541 --> 02:33:40.782]  Deplete the planet, move on to another.
[02:33:40.842 --> 02:33:42.683]  They want benign indifference.
[02:33:43.203 --> 02:33:44.964]  They want us drugged.
[02:33:45.184 --> 02:33:46.125]  We could be pets.
[02:33:46.165 --> 02:33:47.685]  We could be food.
[02:33:48.265 --> 02:33:51.967]  But all we really are is livestock.
[02:33:52.027 --> 02:33:54.428]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[02:33:54.988 --> 02:33:59.450]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles
[02:34:04.062 --> 02:34:10.105]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:34:13.035 --> 02:34:17.399]  All right, we've just got him for about 10 minutes, because then I think he's doing an RT interview overseas.
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:21.143]  And then we're going to go to the veterans I wanted to get on.
[02:34:21.243 --> 02:34:26.929]  Ex-military intelligence, vet, nuclear launch officer, current serving military.
[02:34:26.949 --> 02:34:28.711]  I want to get your take on what's happening.
[02:34:28.751 --> 02:34:30.993]  But you heard Dr. Jerome Corsi last hour.
[02:34:31.033 --> 02:34:34.617]  He said this is the greatest threat of nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:34:35.177 --> 02:34:43.761]  And it's all based on a lie, and WorldNetDaily with their Arab-speaking bureau found all the Al-Qaeda videos with them launching the attacks last week, bragging.
[02:34:44.061 --> 02:34:47.303]  And it's on their channels they've had for two years showing their attacks.
[02:34:47.343 --> 02:34:48.103]  They're that proud.
[02:34:48.523 --> 02:34:53.566]  They got caught earlier this year launching a chemical attack that even Yahoo reported on.
[02:34:53.606 --> 02:34:55.446]  But I wanted to get Dr. Roberts on today.
[02:34:55.747 --> 02:34:57.788]  He wrote a story that's at paulcraigroberts.org.
[02:34:59.468 --> 02:35:01.328]  And we also have it up on InfoWars.com.
[02:35:01.809 --> 02:35:02.309]  Syria.
[02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:04.289]  Another Western war crime in the making.
[02:35:04.669 --> 02:35:05.790]  Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:22.014]  And I wanted to get the former head of policy at the Treasury, father of Reaganomics, on to give a truly conservative perspective on this and to ask him, is it good news that only 9% of Americans in a Reuters poll agree with this?
[02:35:22.154 --> 02:35:26.975]  I think this is the collapse of support and it really shows we have a rogue state
[02:35:27.555 --> 02:35:28.256]  Pleased to be with you, Alex.
[02:35:41.721 --> 02:35:48.306]  Well, they're going to strike, and of course it was not done by Assad, it was staged by the Americans and the Israelis.
[02:35:49.167 --> 02:35:50.588]  We've known this from the beginning.
[02:35:50.928 --> 02:35:57.473]  The minute that Obama said there was a line drawn, we knew they were going to have a false flag event.
[02:35:59.497 --> 02:36:14.203]  The fact that the American people are finally caught on or tired of these wars that don't serve their purposes doesn't matter because Washington now is no longer accountable, except to a few powerful private interests.
[02:36:14.843 --> 02:36:17.144]  So I think it will go ahead.
[02:36:17.164 --> 02:36:26.288]  I don't think nuclear war will result because of this strike, but it's going to result because what the United States is doing
[02:36:27.388 --> 02:36:30.090]  They're radicalizing the Muslims.
[02:36:31.251 --> 02:36:35.454]  It's a way of destabilizing both Russia and China.
[02:36:35.874 --> 02:36:38.777]  Russia has large Muslim populations.
[02:36:39.477 --> 02:36:42.019]  It's bordered by numerous Muslim countries.
[02:36:42.139 --> 02:36:45.561]  China has some Muslim populations and borders.
[02:36:46.302 --> 02:36:48.363]  And so as this radicalization
[02:36:49.415 --> 02:36:55.817]  of Muslim spreads, it spreads into these two countries and becomes destabilizing for them.
[02:36:55.837 --> 02:37:14.764]  And as well, the United States has inside Russia hundreds of non-governmental organizations funded with American money whose purpose is to destabilize Russia, to demand liberalization which
[02:37:15.604 --> 02:37:27.248]  is really a way of creating dissenting voices, arousing the different nationality passions of the peoples in Russia.
[02:37:27.608 --> 02:37:28.568]  The same in China.
[02:37:28.628 --> 02:37:34.690]  In China every time an American company locates a new plant or a bank branch,
[02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:43.932]  And China, they create a board and they put on this board the Chinese relatives of the local and regional party officials.
[02:37:44.573 --> 02:37:55.996]  And so that board becomes a way of, it's a conduit for money into the regional and local Communist Party and it creates loyalties.
[02:37:56.796 --> 02:38:00.339]  That put them at odds with the central government.
[02:38:00.379 --> 02:38:03.882]  So it's a global corporatist takeover above all the nations.
[02:38:04.162 --> 02:38:05.843]  Let me ask you this question, Dr. Roberts.
[02:38:06.163 --> 02:38:18.833]  How far can the madness go when every military officer I talk to says the military's awake and upset, when the polls show almost no one's buying it, but as you said, they don't care, they go forward.
[02:38:19.333 --> 02:38:21.675]  Is there any way to stop this madness?
[02:38:23.076 --> 02:38:23.957]  I doubt it.
[02:38:25.530 --> 02:38:32.692]  I think it will lead to nuclear war because what the Chinese and Russians are learning is that there's no international law.
[02:38:33.292 --> 02:38:42.975]  The United States has no respect for international law and the Chinese and Russians are learning that there is no restraint whatsoever on Washington's criminality.
[02:38:44.136 --> 02:38:53.318]  And since they are isolated diplomatically, they're outgunned militarily, all they really can do is to take refuge in nuclear weapons.
[02:38:53.458 --> 02:38:57.179]  And both are rapidly upgrading their strategic nuclear weapons.
[02:38:57.739 --> 02:39:04.841]  So I think the idiots in Washington, you know, trying to have world hedge enemy are driving the world to nuclear war.
[02:39:05.401 --> 02:39:12.843]  I think that is the certain outcome of the neoconservative policy of American hedge enemy.
[02:39:16.296 --> 02:39:18.579]  Again, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us.
[02:39:19.039 --> 02:39:26.046]  He's an economist and also has worked internationally on many deals, including the peace deals with the Soviet Union back in 1991.
[02:39:29.170 --> 02:39:33.492]  Unfortunately, I have to agree with you and all the other experts I've talked to agree, and I've done my own research.
[02:39:33.512 --> 02:39:47.918]  I think the only thing that may stop it is the military itself quietly leaking information, sabotaging things in a peaceful way, kind of blocking what's going on.
[02:39:47.938 --> 02:39:57.682]  And that's why you see such a focus on persecuting whistleblowers, because the kleptocrats that have seized control of our central government,
[02:39:58.742 --> 02:40:07.787]  Well, you know, Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has warned against it.
[02:40:08.547 --> 02:40:12.869]  But I think on the whole, the military is unable to do anything.
[02:40:13.029 --> 02:40:15.231]  What they would have to do would be simply to have a coup.
[02:40:16.111 --> 02:40:19.153]  But actually, the war serves the purpose of the military.
[02:40:19.173 --> 02:40:21.354]  It serves a military security complex.
[02:40:22.714 --> 02:40:25.576]  They go along, get along generals when they retire.
[02:40:26.536 --> 02:40:31.058]  They either get to be Pentagon consultants or they become lobbyists.
[02:40:31.098 --> 02:40:34.720]  Sure, but it's not going to serve them if we go totally bankrupt and there's a nuclear war.
[02:40:36.423 --> 02:40:39.364]  I know, but everybody thinks about their interests.
[02:40:39.404 --> 02:40:40.485]  Who's looking after me?
[02:40:40.545 --> 02:40:41.525]  This is my chance.
[02:40:42.086 --> 02:40:44.006]  I can't rock the boat.
[02:40:44.026 --> 02:40:56.392]  So it becomes very hard for the military to do something that's actually against the short-run interests of all of the members in the higher ranks.
[02:40:57.232 --> 02:41:00.374]  So I don't know that we can count on the military stopping it.
[02:41:01.707 --> 02:41:03.829]  They haven't stopped any of the other wars.
[02:41:04.909 --> 02:41:06.470]  Why do you think they're going ahead with this now?
[02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:08.092]  To distract from all the scandals?
[02:41:08.172 --> 02:41:11.034]  To try to get Iran to get involved?
[02:41:11.314 --> 02:41:12.455]  So they can have a wider war?
[02:41:13.667 --> 02:41:25.077]  Well, you know, it's part of the neoconservative document that they put out and General Wesley Clark has reported he was shown the same thing when he visited the Pentagon.
[02:41:25.597 --> 02:41:35.266]  So I think what it's really about is the United States was going to pull off in Syria exactly the same scenario it used in Libya.
[02:41:35.806 --> 02:41:49.295]  Only this time the Russians and the Chinese vetoed the no-fly zone because they had learned that the no-fly zone was actually something the Americans and NATO used for attacking Qaddafi's forces.
[02:41:49.655 --> 02:41:50.535]  So they vetoed it.
[02:41:50.595 --> 02:42:01.883]  So the Americans had already, Washington, had already instigated the outside jihadists going into Syria to overthrow the secular president.
[02:42:02.603 --> 02:42:04.584]  And yet, there was no air support.
[02:42:04.644 --> 02:42:08.667]  And so the American-backed forces, the Washington-backed forces, are being defeated.
[02:42:09.867 --> 02:42:15.931]  And so they've got to find some way to come to the aid of the forces.
[02:42:16.011 --> 02:42:21.154]  And so that's what this chemical weapons false flag attack is all about.
[02:42:21.234 --> 02:42:26.598]  It gives Washington an excuse to run in there and rescue the forces that it sent to work.
[02:42:27.438 --> 02:42:33.200]  Sir, Joel Skousen, who does World Affairs Brief, has been very accurate in his analysis, as have you been.
[02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:56.287]  He believes that the Anglo-American power structure is trying to get Russia and China to start a nuclear war, and that they believe, out of that global crisis, they'll be able to create a new police state here, roll out some of the space-based weapons they've got to defeat them, and finally have world domination, and that this is truly a megalomaniacal thing that's happening.
[02:42:56.627 --> 02:42:58.589]  What's your take on that analysis?
[02:42:59.210 --> 02:43:00.631]  Well, we already have a police state.
[02:43:00.751 --> 02:43:01.572]  They already have that.
[02:43:01.792 --> 02:43:03.494]  And nobody survives nuclear war.
[02:43:04.135 --> 02:43:05.856]  I mean, there won't be any survivors.
[02:43:07.078 --> 02:43:10.481]  So I think that's an incorrect analysis.
[02:43:12.623 --> 02:43:19.367]  Okay, well, you and I can see the end of this, and he can see the end of it, and everybody else I talk to that's intelligent can see the end of it.
[02:43:19.687 --> 02:43:23.369]  What is the power structure thinking, then, if they don't want World War III?
[02:43:23.669 --> 02:43:24.830]  Why are they trying to start it?
[02:43:25.270 --> 02:43:31.634]  Or are they so arrogant, like Don Corzine, making 40-to-1 bets in the stock market, that they just think they're invincible?
[02:43:32.577 --> 02:43:41.061]  Well, they probably are full of hubris, and they're full of the ideology that they're indispensable and exceptional, but they're also counting on winning.
[02:43:41.941 --> 02:43:45.742]  They're counting on their strategy of destabilizing Russia and China working.
[02:43:46.043 --> 02:43:56.267]  I mean, Washington does have fifth columns in both countries, and so if radicalizing the Muslim populations causes more instability,
[02:43:56.747 --> 02:43:58.689]  Then Washington says, we can win.
[02:43:58.789 --> 02:44:01.732]  So they're banking on winning without the nuclear war.
[02:44:01.752 --> 02:44:06.817]  But what they're overlooking is that that's the only weapons that China and Russia would have to stop this.
[02:44:06.957 --> 02:44:10.460]  So I think it would come out, we'll all be simply destroyed.
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:11.862]  It'd be the end of life on Earth.
[02:44:12.942 --> 02:44:16.324]  And they also like to use the radical Muslims they're flooding the U.S.
[02:44:16.364 --> 02:44:21.906]  and Europe with as another way to destabilize and then take all our liberties from the threat they literally created.
[02:44:21.946 --> 02:44:30.290]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, folks can read your columns on your site and syndicated around the web on places like InfoWars.com, PaulCraigRoberts.org.
[02:44:30.590 --> 02:44:31.850]  Thank you so much for your analysis.
[02:44:32.331 --> 02:44:33.311]  Pleased to talk to you.
[02:44:33.771 --> 02:44:34.371]  Thank you, doctor.
[02:44:34.872 --> 02:44:35.512]  Well, there you go.
[02:44:35.552 --> 02:44:41.635]  There's the father of Reaganomics, listed as one of the top ten economists in the world by Forbes Magazine and other publications.
[02:44:42.495 --> 02:44:46.679]  Here telling us that we're probably going to end up in the next few years, if not sooner, of nuclear war and we're all dead.
[02:44:47.660 --> 02:45:01.252]  And Don Corzine and Blank Fine, everybody just doesn't care because they've just got trillions they've stolen and they're all just got jet copters and twenty mistresses and they're invincible like every other group of control freaks in history.
[02:45:03.974 --> 02:45:05.396]  They've got to have world government, man.
[02:45:05.416 --> 02:45:06.497]  They've just got to have it.
[02:45:07.383 --> 02:45:08.963]  They gotta have it, they gotta have it now.
[02:45:08.983 --> 02:45:12.204]  We're gonna go to your phone calls here now in just a moment.
[02:45:12.924 --> 02:45:17.445]  Ahead of all this, it's more important than ever that everyone become PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers.
[02:45:18.005 --> 02:45:21.446]  One $5.95 a month membership that pays for us to build the news division.
[02:45:22.286 --> 02:45:32.168]  Let's 11 people with the same username and passcode simultaneously log in, see all my films, the nightly news, the commercial free video and audio podcast, the daytime radio show.

[02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:44.384]  It's all at PrisonPlanet.TV and please don't forget during all these crises it is more important than ever to fund and support this operation.
[02:45:45.365 --> 02:45:47.646]  During crises our actual revenue even goes down.
[02:45:47.706 --> 02:45:54.769]  You'd think it would go up but people just get completely concerned about the information not supporting the outfits that are actually helping warn people.
[02:45:55.249 --> 02:45:56.490]  I think this can be stopped.
[02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:59.191]  There are a lot of smart people in the system that realize where this is going.
[02:46:00.424 --> 02:46:07.007]  That's why they haven't gone over the edge, because every Joint Chief of Staff has said, don't do this, and don't attack Iran, and don't... Because they war fight, folks.
[02:46:07.447 --> 02:46:09.688]  And they know what the Russians are up to.
[02:46:10.369 --> 02:46:12.830]  And the globalists have this double game, trying to take over China.
[02:46:13.050 --> 02:46:13.930]  It's just madness.
[02:46:14.610 --> 02:46:15.511]  It's not America.
[02:46:17.065 --> 02:46:20.269]  So please support InfoWarsTore.com with all the great products.

[02:47:06.377 --> 02:47:08.277]  It just shows how people need to be prepared.

[02:47:27.444 --> 02:47:30.287]  All right, my friends, let's go to your phone calls now.
[02:47:30.788 --> 02:47:37.115]  Doc, and then David, and then Scott, and then Passman.
[02:47:37.255 --> 02:47:39.938]  In fact, I want to go to Doc and then Passman first.
[02:47:40.318 --> 02:47:41.239]  Doc, you're on the air.
[02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:43.322]  You say you're ex-military intelligence.
[02:47:43.662 --> 02:47:45.865]  What is your take on all of this madness?
[02:47:47.381 --> 02:47:48.742]  I don't want to get into it too much.
[02:47:48.822 --> 02:47:50.724]  I'm ex-MI and also ex-SPEC Ops.
[02:47:51.685 --> 02:47:53.427]  I've served with the U.S.
[02:47:53.848 --> 02:48:00.716]  as military and as a civilian, and I also served in a foreign army in a Third World Rush Fire War in Africa in the 70s.
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:09.084]  I was also in the Peacekeeping Force in the Sinai in the 70s under Carter.
[02:48:09.525 --> 02:48:17.092]  This is a message that I got about a week ago from a friend who's with Military Sealift Command on a row-row boat.
[02:48:17.132 --> 02:48:18.613]  That stands for roll-on, roll-off.
[02:48:19.274 --> 02:48:22.497]  He gave me an email and a message from his sat phone.
[02:48:22.918 --> 02:48:26.221]  He said that we are loaded, ready to roll, and we're headed for the Met.
[02:48:26.261 --> 02:48:27.202]  That was over a week ago.
[02:48:27.938 --> 02:48:31.120]  Second point, there's a book that all of your listeners should read.
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:33.701]  It's by the British author Ian Johnson.
[02:48:34.102 --> 02:48:55.634]  It is called A Mosque in Munich, and it details through declassified documents how after World War II, the CIA got SS war criminals and the Gestapo, allied them with the Muslim Brotherhood, sent these guys to the Middle East, and gave a crap load of money to the Muslim Brotherhood, and then got these war criminals
[02:48:56.334 --> 02:48:56.754]  Before.
[02:49:19.416 --> 02:49:19.977]  A week ago.
[02:49:20.657 --> 02:49:25.960]  This guy works for the Military Sealip Command.
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:27.360]  He's a senior mate.
[02:49:27.500 --> 02:49:28.701]  He's right below an officer.
[02:49:29.021 --> 02:49:30.322]  He's been there for God.
[02:49:31.641 --> 02:49:32.882]  Oh, over 30 years.
[02:49:32.922 --> 02:49:34.543]  He's been with them since about the 70s.
[02:49:34.663 --> 02:49:35.404]  All right.
[02:49:36.144 --> 02:49:43.429]  Um, a military seal of command is a civilian part of the Navy that carries cargo all over the world.
[02:49:43.849 --> 02:49:47.211]  He's on a really big ship called a row row that does the roll on roll off.
[02:49:47.732 --> 02:49:49.373]  It's got big hatches on the ship.
[02:49:49.713 --> 02:49:50.654]  It can carry tanks.
[02:49:51.294 --> 02:49:53.155]  It's like a it's like a rolling Alex.
[02:49:58.856 --> 02:50:02.098]  It's an amphibious landing delivery platform, correct?
[02:50:02.438 --> 02:50:04.279]  Something like the Coronado?
[02:50:04.879 --> 02:50:10.422]  It can handle huge trucks, it can handle Humvees, it can handle M1 Abrams tanks.
[02:50:10.922 --> 02:50:18.246]  He said to me, in a very brief message, in an email message, he said, we're about ready to go into the med, he said we're loaded up and we're ready to go.
[02:50:19.594 --> 02:50:32.578]  And to be specific, then that would mean that they have contingencies for land forces, which we know they're already deploying into the Golan areas, and they're also deploying into Jordan and into the Gaza area.
[02:50:32.618 --> 02:50:34.259]  That was a month ago, or two months ago now.
[02:50:35.939 --> 02:50:36.900]  Let me ask you this.
[02:50:37.420 --> 02:50:41.161]  What do you think of this overall operation, and what do you think of the chemical attack?
[02:50:42.486 --> 02:50:44.628]  I think that it is, it is, it is.
[02:50:44.828 --> 02:50:50.712]  If you study political science, and a guy named Dr. Hans Morgenthau, there's no such thing as foreign policy.
[02:50:51.253 --> 02:50:55.336]  All foreign aggression is done to cover internal problems in a country.
[02:50:55.736 --> 02:51:03.322]  Hitler's problem, of Lebensraum, because between the wars, they had a high birth rate, he had to move east because of German- Exactly!
[02:51:03.362 --> 02:51:04.723]  Living space, well said.
[02:51:05.084 --> 02:51:06.344]  That man knows what he's talking about.
[02:51:06.385 --> 02:51:06.785]  We'll be back.
[02:51:09.235 --> 02:51:15.462]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.
[02:51:15.482 --> 02:51:21.989]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cells' ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health.
[02:51:22.430 --> 02:51:26.314]  Listen to the real-world results of Doug and his wife after taking One World Way.
[02:51:27.975 --> 02:51:30.817]  For years, I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes.
[02:51:31.057 --> 02:51:34.499]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace.
[02:51:34.959 --> 02:51:41.183]  After being on One World Way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes.
[02:51:41.643 --> 02:51:45.646]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone.
[02:51:45.726 --> 02:51:54.031]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure.
[02:51:54.551 --> 02:51:54.931]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:51:54.971 --> 02:51:55.191]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:51:55.211 --> 02:51:55.271]  888-988-3325.
[02:51:55.291 --> 02:51:56.332]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:51:56.352 --> 02:51:57.352]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[02:51:57.553 --> 02:51:58.633]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:52:10.439 --> 02:52:20.847]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:52:21.088 --> 02:52:25.231]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:52:25.551 --> 02:52:27.993]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:52:28.293 --> 02:52:39.082]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:52:39.562 --> 02:52:42.863]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:52:43.043 --> 02:52:48.685]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:52:49.185 --> 02:52:58.689]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:52:59.089 --> 02:53:00.249]  The war is here.
[02:53:00.569 --> 02:53:02.010]  It's an info war.
[02:53:02.470 --> 02:53:04.210]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:53:08.854 --> 02:53:12.956]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:13.616 --> 02:53:15.757]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:16.657 --> 02:53:25.000]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:25.620 --> 02:53:30.522]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:31.158 --> 02:53:42.121]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:42.521 --> 02:53:49.523]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:50.203 --> 02:53:54.465]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:54.505 --> 02:53:57.666]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:58.106 --> 02:54:05.049]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:54:05.369 --> 02:54:06.349]  Protect your immune system.
[02:54:06.630 --> 02:54:07.670]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:21.571 --> 02:54:28.333]  You know, Hollywood is a psych-warfare system.
[02:54:28.373 --> 02:54:32.835]  It can dehumanize and destroy us and make us where we can be pushed around.
[02:54:33.335 --> 02:54:34.635]  By the way, the mayor of L.A.
[02:54:34.655 --> 02:54:36.456]  has declared an emergency and says L.A.
[02:54:36.516 --> 02:54:37.316]  is collapsing.
[02:54:38.216 --> 02:54:41.838]  That everyone's exiting that has any money and so is the film production.
[02:54:41.858 --> 02:54:42.378]  Yeah, it's over.
[02:54:43.337 --> 02:54:48.647]  All you people that think the new world order is going to deliver you power, it was liberty that delivered you success.
[02:54:49.249 --> 02:54:53.677]  And now you've basically, you know, won it all over it, and so now you have nothing.
[02:54:54.468 --> 02:55:01.334]  That's my one piece of solace for all you evil people that think just because you know how things run and you can manipulate other folks that you're in control.
[02:55:02.014 --> 02:55:03.135]  You're out of control.
[02:55:03.616 --> 02:55:05.577]  The only time you're in control is doing the right thing.
[02:55:06.138 --> 02:55:09.941]  Let's go to past man, then we'll go to David and David and Scott.
[02:55:10.341 --> 02:55:11.942]  We're gonna get to everybody, going to overdrive.
[02:55:12.022 --> 02:55:15.465]  Past man, you say you're a former nuclear launch officer.
[02:55:16.126 --> 02:55:22.211]  Do you agree with Dr. Roberts and Dr. Corsi both saying this is one of the most dangerous times in world history?
[02:55:23.922 --> 02:55:25.303]  Well, I think it could be, Alex.
[02:55:25.963 --> 02:55:31.528]  I'm a former intercontinental ballistic missile launch officer from the 321st.
[02:55:32.368 --> 02:55:34.790]  Howdy to all my brothers there from the 321st.
[02:55:35.050 --> 02:55:41.515]  And I am completely and thoroughly familiar with all top secret nuclear weapons launch plans.
[02:55:42.235 --> 02:55:44.717]  I can't talk about it, but I can give you my opinion.
[02:55:45.458 --> 02:55:45.758]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:45.778 --> 02:55:47.039]  Give us your take on this, please.
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:52.883]  My opinion is all it's going to take is one nuclear weapon.
[02:55:53.382 --> 02:55:57.245]  To be released, and everything's gonna be released.
[02:55:57.985 --> 02:55:59.626]  Because everyone is afraid.
[02:56:00.207 --> 02:56:03.249]  China, Russia, they're all afraid we're gonna hit them first.
[02:56:03.289 --> 02:56:07.932]  So everybody's gonna go up, because nobody wants to get caught with their birds on the ground.
[02:56:09.853 --> 02:56:10.714]  It's the end of the world.
[02:56:11.535 --> 02:56:13.016]  And that's standard, exactly.
[02:56:13.056 --> 02:56:14.717]  So what do you think the bankers are doing?
[02:56:15.317 --> 02:56:19.200]  I mean, I've never called for a military coup, but at a certain point, I mean, this is getting out of control.
[02:56:21.673 --> 02:56:26.240]  Yeah, I mean, I listen to your show and I think you've got a pretty good handle on the banker.
[02:56:26.621 --> 02:56:28.944]  I'm not really an economic expert.
[02:56:28.964 --> 02:56:34.473]  They must have some pretty good bunkers they're going to go down into and wait this thing out if it goes up.
[02:56:36.391 --> 02:56:37.031]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:56:37.091 --> 02:56:41.774]  I'm not a nuclear expert like you, but I've studied the textbooks on it.
[02:56:42.014 --> 02:56:45.195]  The northern hemisphere will be unlivable for 50 years or so.
[02:56:45.215 --> 02:56:49.237]  I mean, you'll have massive cancer rates, 10-20,000 times the RDR.
[02:56:49.577 --> 02:56:50.958]  Southern hemisphere won't be as bad.
[02:56:51.038 --> 02:56:53.779]  But, I mean, it'll create a nuclear winter, probably.
[02:56:53.799 --> 02:56:55.180]  The temperatures will drop.
[02:56:55.480 --> 02:56:58.062]  We might have winters, you know, where it's like Minnesota and Texas.
[02:56:58.902 --> 02:57:03.684]  I mean, for everybody living in the West, it's the end of the world.
[02:57:03.704 --> 02:57:04.825]  I mean, is that what you've got, sir?
[02:57:06.462 --> 02:57:08.043]  Well, I think it's not just the West.
[02:57:08.163 --> 02:57:11.185]  I think all over the world is going to be pretty bad.
[02:57:11.205 --> 02:57:12.767]  No, I know, but I'm worried about me.
[02:57:13.027 --> 02:57:14.288]  I mean, I'll be honest at that point.
[02:57:14.628 --> 02:57:16.950]  Yeah, sure, China, Russia, it's going to be molten as well.
[02:57:18.651 --> 02:57:20.612]  Yeah, I would say, you know, look at your map.
[02:57:20.692 --> 02:57:24.235]  If you live near a military base, you're probably a target.
[02:57:25.336 --> 02:57:27.517]  Yeah, so I'm in Austin surrounded by military bases.
[02:57:27.577 --> 02:57:28.037]  I'm dead.
[02:57:29.198 --> 02:57:29.959]  Yep, pretty much.
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:32.921]  I can talk about Russian stuff, no problem.
[02:57:50.971 --> 02:58:02.605]  Well, tell us... I mean, from what I've read, they would probably try to hit something like Fort Hood with just five ICBMs alone, and they might have as many as a hundred warheads in there.
[02:58:02.785 --> 02:58:04.187]  That would not feel very good, would it?
[02:58:06.049 --> 02:58:06.269]  No.
[02:58:06.670 --> 02:58:08.312]  No, you'd probably be a crispy critter.
[02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:12.871]  I wonder if there's anywhere safe.
[02:58:13.572 --> 02:58:14.153]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:58:14.333 --> 02:58:26.546]  If you can get underground, you know, the global bankers, my guess is they got nice deep underground condos somewhere and they're gonna, you know, when it happens, they're gonna just kick back and, you know, laugh at the rest of us, I guess.
[02:58:26.987 --> 02:58:28.788]  And they've been setting Homeland Security up.
[02:58:29.628 --> 02:58:32.989]  For re-emerging to restore order after they've done it.
[02:58:33.009 --> 02:58:35.649]  This could be the coup against America by the New World Order.
[02:58:36.069 --> 02:58:37.609]  It's going to send a war with Russia and China.
[02:58:37.629 --> 02:58:40.890]  And that's actually what Skousen says, but he thinks it's coming down the road.
[02:58:40.950 --> 02:58:41.730]  It could be coming now.
[02:58:42.030 --> 02:58:42.910]  Sir, I'm going to come back to you.
[02:58:42.930 --> 02:58:44.791]  We're going to do 30 minutes of overdrive.
[02:58:44.831 --> 02:58:47.191]  We're going to go to David, Frankie, Scott, David.
[02:58:47.211 --> 02:58:48.051]  We're going to all of you.
[02:58:48.071 --> 02:58:49.032]  Stay there, past man.
[02:58:49.952 --> 02:58:53.492]  We're going to come right back with David in Maryland after past man, then David in Indiana.
[02:58:53.833 --> 02:58:55.253]  Scott, Frankie, stay with us.
[02:58:59.341 --> 02:59:02.645]  Every three seconds, someone becomes a victim of identity theft.
[02:59:02.925 --> 02:59:07.029]  We also hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on U.S.
[02:59:07.069 --> 02:59:07.550]  citizens.

[03:00:01.472 --> 03:00:02.832]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.533 --> 03:00:06.714]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:13.820 --> 03:00:17.982]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:18.642 --> 03:00:19.442]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.222 --> 03:00:21.143]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:21.783 --> 03:00:25.404]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:25.965 --> 03:00:30.066]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.266 --> 03:00:35.909]  Alright, we're gonna finish up with Past Man, Nuclear Launch Officer, retired.
[03:00:36.709 --> 03:00:39.370]  Then we're gonna go to David, and then Scott,
[03:00:40.569 --> 03:00:42.850]  And then Frankie and David.
[03:00:47.173 --> 03:00:51.375]  By the way, you cannot overemphasize how serious this is.
[03:00:51.615 --> 03:00:52.536]  This is not hype here.
[03:00:52.556 --> 03:01:01.261]  I mean, I can have the former head of the Treasury on, I can have a former, you know, specialist in all sorts of secret operations, Dr. Corsi, on.
[03:01:01.341 --> 03:01:02.341]  It's all the same analysis.
[03:01:02.962 --> 03:01:04.462]  And it's what the Russians are saying.
[03:01:04.502 --> 03:01:05.743]  You people are insane.
[03:01:06.143 --> 03:01:07.684]  You're like a monkey with a hand grenade.
[03:01:07.724 --> 03:01:08.445]  Leave us alone.
[03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:13.646]  And again, I've been no fan of the Russians, but our own globalist put the Bolsheviks in.
[03:01:13.686 --> 03:01:15.528]  That's now been declassified as public.
[03:01:16.109 --> 03:01:17.190]  It's these bankers, folks.
[03:01:17.210 --> 03:01:20.755]  They have just been screwing everybody over, playing us off against each other.
[03:01:20.775 --> 03:01:23.398]  And I talked to a major defense contractor.
[03:01:24.488 --> 03:01:26.049]  A billionaire who left the U.S.
[03:01:26.089 --> 03:01:31.832]  five years ago to an island off Australia saying there won't be an America in five years.
[03:01:31.852 --> 03:01:32.632]  That was five years ago.
[03:01:32.652 --> 03:01:36.794]  I don't know if this could have been planned that far back, but she wouldn't say what it was.
[03:01:37.655 --> 03:01:40.456]  Passman, other points about this madness?
[03:01:40.936 --> 03:01:43.578]  Any of your colleagues you've talked to, where you think this is going?
[03:01:46.079 --> 03:01:51.982]  Well, the only thing I can say is it's my opinion that if one nuclear weapon goes off, they all go off.
[03:01:55.083 --> 03:01:57.685]  That's as much as I'm comfortable saying, and it's my opinion.
[03:01:59.868 --> 03:02:01.029]  Well, that is the default.
[03:02:01.069 --> 03:02:02.710]  They call it, what, total commitment.
[03:02:03.271 --> 03:02:15.382]  I mean, a lot of this has come out in congressional hearings that all the subs come up and launch their cruise missiles and their ICBMs, I guess their medium range, and then I guess
[03:02:17.082 --> 03:02:20.303]  And then I guess they've got all those intercontinental ballistic missiles, still got some of those.
[03:02:20.863 --> 03:02:22.204]  And then they've got all the bombers.
[03:02:22.664 --> 03:02:24.124]  And then I guess it's just total commitment.
[03:02:24.144 --> 03:02:31.907]  And then I guess they use special forces deployed along the Russian border to use those to destroy sub-bases.
[03:02:32.407 --> 03:02:33.968]  Man, we're talking about a lot of radiation here.
[03:02:34.288 --> 03:02:36.189]  Any idea how many nukes will go off?
[03:02:36.629 --> 03:02:39.830]  Isn't it something like 40,000 if they have a big nuclear war?
[03:02:41.607 --> 03:02:45.811]  Yeah, I think it's less than that now, at least what I read.
[03:02:45.831 --> 03:02:50.957]  I don't know how much of the numbers are classified, so I don't think I should say that.
[03:02:51.257 --> 03:02:53.239]  Plus, all the stuff we're told is complete bull.
[03:02:53.259 --> 03:03:00.266]  You know, the Air Force has leaked one time that they've developed stuff beyond nuclear weapons, so we'll be lucky if they don't blow the whole planet up.
[03:03:01.968 --> 03:03:02.428]  That's true.
[03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:04.991]  We'll be lucky if they don't.
[03:03:07.619 --> 03:03:13.745]  Do you agree with the folks we had on earlier saying this is probably the most dangerous time ever, even worse than the Cuban Missile Crisis?
[03:03:15.086 --> 03:03:16.147]  It sounds like it to me.
[03:03:16.767 --> 03:03:17.348]  It really does.
[03:03:22.372 --> 03:03:23.593]  What about Russia and China?
[03:03:23.633 --> 03:03:24.674]  They might blink.
[03:03:24.694 --> 03:03:27.157]  I mean, they've already kind of sold out to the globalists.
[03:03:27.217 --> 03:03:30.399]  I mean, they could just submit and say, OK, you rule.
[03:03:30.419 --> 03:03:33.002]  I mean, maybe the globalists think that's what they're going to do.
[03:03:34.710 --> 03:03:35.851]  Yeah, it doesn't work that way.
[03:03:35.871 --> 03:03:42.898]  You know, we, we, uh, I think, well, man, I can't say that.
[03:03:44.159 --> 03:03:46.462]  I think Russia and China target everybody.
[03:03:46.482 --> 03:03:48.604]  Yeah, including each other.
[03:03:48.664 --> 03:03:49.345]  That's on record.
[03:03:49.645 --> 03:03:50.125]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:03:50.426 --> 03:03:52.928]  And nobody can, nobody can sit on the sidelines in this.
[03:03:53.709 --> 03:03:56.292]  So, you know, take that for what it is.
[03:03:57.162 --> 03:04:00.444]  Well no, I mean it was declassified that Russia approached in what, 1964?
[03:04:00.664 --> 03:04:04.326]  That came out last year.
[03:04:04.406 --> 03:04:05.206]  Approached the U.S.
[03:04:05.246 --> 03:04:06.727]  and asked for a joint strike on China.
[03:04:06.967 --> 03:04:08.688]  So that shows how crazy the Russians are.
[03:04:09.108 --> 03:04:10.889]  They already wanted to have a nuclear war with China.
[03:04:11.149 --> 03:04:12.009]  Is that what you were getting at?
[03:04:13.410 --> 03:04:14.190]  Yeah, yeah, that.
[03:04:14.391 --> 03:04:16.392]  And just that everybody targets everybody.
[03:04:16.432 --> 03:04:22.575]  So there's not, there's not... When this thing happens, it's not going to be, you know, a slow dance.
[03:04:22.715 --> 03:04:23.415]  One, two, three.
[03:04:23.435 --> 03:04:24.996]  It's just going to be shoot to work.
[03:04:27.071 --> 03:04:27.451]  Exactly.
[03:04:27.491 --> 03:04:30.613]  Everything's pre-targeted, drilled, and it's just Pavlovian.
[03:04:30.654 --> 03:04:34.816]  Turn the keys, enter the launch sequence when you've got the code, and fire the weapons.
[03:04:36.497 --> 03:04:41.481]  Yeah, what we say in the missile business is read a step, do a step, eat a banana, turn the key.
[03:04:44.703 --> 03:04:45.604]  Monkey with a hand grenade.
[03:04:48.841 --> 03:04:52.564]  Oh man, I hope when this is all over, people go dick the Gloveless out of their rat holes, man.
[03:04:53.345 --> 03:04:55.186]  Somebody record this and save it.
[03:04:55.226 --> 03:04:57.989]  Just make sure, make sure they all get hung high.
[03:04:58.569 --> 03:04:59.270]  God bless you, sir.
[03:04:59.310 --> 03:05:00.751]  We'll be right back and take more calls.
[03:05:00.771 --> 03:05:02.993]  Stay with us, David and Frankie and Scott and David.
[03:05:03.013 --> 03:05:04.534]  We're coming right back to you on the other side.
[03:05:04.554 --> 03:05:06.235]  David and then Scott first.
[03:05:09.278 --> 03:05:10.459]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

[03:06:02.786 --> 03:06:05.628]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[03:07:57.579 --> 03:07:58.340]  Home of the Berkey Guy.
[03:08:13.837 --> 03:08:18.042]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:18.663 --> 03:08:19.484]  You want answers?
[03:08:20.245 --> 03:08:21.186]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:21.807 --> 03:08:25.432]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:25.992 --> 03:08:30.077]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:37.691 --> 03:08:48.119]  All right, we're live, ladies and gentlemen, into overdrive, going to military veterans' calls about the concern of nuclear war, starting with Russia and China backed up as proxies.
[03:08:49.279 --> 03:08:52.242]  And we've had a bunch of top experts on Dr. Corsi, Dr. Roberts.
[03:08:52.302 --> 03:08:54.683]  They have been saying that's probably what this could lead to.
[03:08:56.144 --> 03:09:00.267]  And then once Iran starts attacking people, I mean, this is a big political diversion.
[03:09:00.668 --> 03:09:03.450]  It's a perfect reason for homeland security to take over society.
[03:09:04.030 --> 03:09:06.152]  And the globalists hate Americans more than anybody.
[03:09:06.852 --> 03:09:29.519]  And during a major war, even if it's just a theater war, regional war, with Iran attacking Israel back and forth, chemical weapons being used, scud missiles, Iran's announced that, they're gonna be able to clamp down, stage some events, Iran might even pull the trigger on sleeper cells, there'll be real events, and then that's an excuse to just go about their business, robbing the pension funds, everything else will just salute the flag.
[03:09:30.200 --> 03:09:33.761]  We're talking to David in Maryland, former Army, what's your take on this, sir?
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:35.580]  Yeah, Alex.
[03:09:36.621 --> 03:09:39.764]  The one thing that a lot of people don't realize is how close we are.
[03:09:40.385 --> 03:09:45.109]  If you do look at the DEFCON level, they got it listed at 5 now.
[03:09:46.490 --> 03:09:47.951]  And that should wake people up.
[03:09:50.253 --> 03:09:55.918]  Well, guys, pull up the DEFCON thing from NORAD and Cheyenne Mountain.
[03:09:55.938 --> 03:09:58.401]  We can pull up a graphic and show people the different DEFCONs.
[03:09:58.781 --> 03:10:00.883]  Explain to people what the DEFCON system is.
[03:10:02.199 --> 03:10:04.186]  That's where it tells you where your alert level is.
[03:10:04.708 --> 03:10:05.831]  How high the alert is.
[03:10:06.032 --> 03:10:07.356]  And we're sitting pretty darn high.
[03:10:12.771 --> 03:10:29.576]  What is your take on the fact that there's evidence, overwhelming evidence, that the Syrian rebels launched the chemical attack, and there's even videos of it, and even Kerry and Carney are saying, oh, this is no big deal.
[03:10:29.796 --> 03:10:30.536]  Even who did it?
[03:10:30.857 --> 03:10:31.997]  We've just got to go in now.
[03:10:32.237 --> 03:10:34.238]  When it's their rebels they put in that did it.
[03:10:34.698 --> 03:10:35.258]  It's amazing.
[03:10:36.578 --> 03:10:37.399]  Absolutely.
[03:10:37.419 --> 03:10:38.800]  And most people are aware of it.
[03:10:39.160 --> 03:10:40.521]  There are a lot of people that know.
[03:10:40.741 --> 03:10:42.302]  There are a lot of people that talk about it.
[03:10:42.402 --> 03:10:43.243]  But what do you do?
[03:10:43.983 --> 03:10:50.327]  I mean, I talk out the wazoo to people and it just, you know, sometimes it seems like it's just bouncing off people's heads.
[03:10:52.669 --> 03:10:59.814]  And then you look around and you see, you watch what happened with Miley Cyrus and that, and you wonder how come our society's gotten so decadent.
[03:11:00.543 --> 03:11:08.646]  Well, you know, a lot of the times there's not even a DEFCON going on, but the fact that it's in 5, from people I've talked to, they say it's more like in DEFCON 3 or 2.
[03:11:09.346 --> 03:11:12.208]  And once this bombing starts, it's going to go to DEFCON 2.
[03:11:12.888 --> 03:11:15.449]  And I guess DEFCON 1 is going to go ahead and launch all the missiles, isn't it?
[03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:18.310]  Exactly.
[03:11:20.970 --> 03:11:22.951]  So, that's all I had to say on the subject.
[03:11:40.259 --> 03:11:41.641]  Hey, what's up man?
[03:11:42.162 --> 03:11:48.710]  I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you I'm not as, you know, special and everything as these other guests you've had.
[03:11:48.831 --> 03:11:51.714]  I know, did you hear those two other guys?
[03:11:51.815 --> 03:11:52.556]  I know that stuff.
[03:11:52.876 --> 03:11:53.837]  They were the real deal.
[03:11:53.857 --> 03:11:54.618]  Did you hear those guys?
[03:11:55.279 --> 03:11:58.423]  Yeah, I heard him, and you know, I'm just, I was just meat for the grinder.
[03:11:58.463 --> 03:12:01.046]  I was a rifleman in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:12:01.086 --> 03:12:03.429]  Hey buddy, that's important, that's important right there.
[03:12:03.709 --> 03:12:08.234]  Ah, well, you know, I learned a lot about life, but you know, I'm gonna stay on topic here.
[03:12:08.635 --> 03:12:11.718]  A lot of people are talking about the nuclear end of it, and you know,
[03:12:12.535 --> 03:12:14.857]  I'm, you know, that's very possible.
[03:12:14.877 --> 03:12:19.901]  And let's just go ahead and assume that Syria will be attacked by United States, UK, whatever.
[03:12:20.601 --> 03:12:30.669]  But I, as much as it breaks my heart, I have to disagree with Dr. Roberts when he said that other than nuclear options, Russia and China have no response.
[03:12:30.989 --> 03:12:36.494]  And I just want to go ahead and remind everybody that how powerful they are economically.
[03:12:37.114 --> 03:12:42.359]  I mean, they owned together trillions of dollars worth of treasuries that they could dump overnight.
[03:12:42.439 --> 03:12:44.321]  They wouldn't even have to fire a single shot.
[03:12:44.441 --> 03:12:45.622]  No, no, I agree with you.
[03:12:46.202 --> 03:12:47.363]  And I think Roberts is wrong.
[03:12:47.383 --> 03:12:50.766]  I think they're very close to... I don't think he's fully wrong.
[03:12:50.826 --> 03:12:51.707]  I think he's intelligent.
[03:12:51.727 --> 03:12:52.588]  I respect his view.
[03:12:53.148 --> 03:12:53.349]  But...
[03:12:54.426 --> 03:12:55.787]  Of course he thinks they're going to do it, too.
[03:12:55.827 --> 03:12:59.250]  The question is, is there any way for sanity to prevail?
[03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:03.413]  Can they have the Joint Chiefs come back out and say it's a bad idea, as they've already done?
[03:13:03.433 --> 03:13:05.434]  I mean, we're seeing a lot of good signs.
[03:13:05.454 --> 03:13:07.155]  This would have already happened with these crazies.
[03:13:07.676 --> 03:13:10.438]  Look, Cheney had them attack Russia-held areas.
[03:13:10.678 --> 03:13:14.941]  When the Russians rolled in medium-range mobile missile trucks, they pulled out.
[03:13:15.942 --> 03:13:17.843]  They had NATO troops landing to back them up.
[03:13:18.123 --> 03:13:21.706]  The Russians came and rolled in, so let's get it on right now, and rolled their nukes in.
[03:13:24.514 --> 03:13:25.094]  That's the thing.
[03:13:25.195 --> 03:13:25.935]  I just don't get it.
[03:13:25.975 --> 03:13:30.118]  It's like these psychos have to play this game because it's the only thing that excites them.
[03:13:30.698 --> 03:13:32.239]  I think that's what's part of this.
[03:13:32.940 --> 03:13:36.162]  And also what the gentleman said earlier about how war is the health of the state.
[03:13:36.562 --> 03:13:38.003]  They need this as a diversion.
[03:13:38.443 --> 03:13:42.486]  Maybe they're just doing this and escalating as a diversion from the scandals.
[03:13:42.526 --> 03:13:43.386]  Maybe they won't do it.
[03:13:43.827 --> 03:13:45.368]  What else do you think we could do to stop this?
[03:13:46.846 --> 03:13:48.367]  Oh, I don't think there's much stopping it.
[03:13:48.407 --> 03:13:55.192]  I mean, it's a long, convoluted plan that's been going back since 1913 for domination.
[03:13:55.492 --> 03:14:03.697]  And as long as the petroglyph remains in effect, there's not much that can be done to stop anything that these guys want to do.
[03:14:03.717 --> 03:14:08.701]  So we're just going to let Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and the Dutch and British Royalty and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers...
[03:14:09.822 --> 03:14:14.692]  Just run around and murder everybody and take our rights and bankrupt everything and de-industrialize us.
[03:14:15.353 --> 03:14:18.319]  At a certain point, people know who's doing this.
[03:14:19.574 --> 03:14:21.354]  And they do, but it's a cycle.
[03:14:21.414 --> 03:14:23.615]  It's just, you know, just like a solar system.
[03:14:24.175 --> 03:14:29.156]  A sun forms itself, it gets great and powerful and big and bright, and then it caves in on itself.
[03:14:29.176 --> 03:14:30.076]  And then it blows up.
[03:14:30.696 --> 03:14:33.877]  And then it blows up and maybe takes everything around it with it, you know.
[03:14:33.937 --> 03:14:37.097]  So, unfortunately, there's a natural cycle to things.
[03:14:37.137 --> 03:14:40.278]  Even psychopaths and bankers, there's natural cycles.
[03:14:40.598 --> 03:14:42.758]  No, they destroy themselves, everybody with them.
[03:14:43.658 --> 03:14:45.259]  And I think that's what Roberts was saying then.
[03:14:45.319 --> 03:14:46.219]  He just says we're doomed.
[03:14:47.361 --> 03:14:47.621]  Exactly.
[03:14:47.721 --> 03:14:53.747]  And, you know, being prepared is probably the best thing you can do to help yourself and your friends and your family.
[03:14:54.508 --> 03:14:58.932]  And, you know, there's not much... I mean, look at... we're just the peons, you know?
[03:14:59.593 --> 03:15:00.193]  What can we do?
[03:15:00.213 --> 03:15:00.974]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:15:00.994 --> 03:15:02.055]  They morally destroyed us.
[03:15:02.075 --> 03:15:03.056]  That's why it's so devilish.
[03:15:03.096 --> 03:15:03.977]  It's beyond humans.
[03:15:04.437 --> 03:15:05.938]  They turned us all into a bunch of idiots.
[03:15:06.418 --> 03:15:06.938]  Not everybody.
[03:15:06.958 --> 03:15:08.298]  9% approval rating for this war.
[03:15:08.518 --> 03:15:09.459]  You know, I think there's hope.
[03:15:09.879 --> 03:15:23.623]  I just think people better get how much danger we're in, and better make some phone calls, and pray, and politically do whatever you got to, pull your money out of the big banks, let them know why you're doing it, and realize these corporations that are running things are our enemy.
[03:15:23.643 --> 03:15:24.804]  I mean, they are our enemy.
[03:15:25.524 --> 03:15:26.204]  Let's go ahead.
[03:15:26.224 --> 03:15:28.765]  I mean, these bankers put the commies in, man.
[03:15:29.105 --> 03:15:30.526]  We owe Russia an apology.
[03:15:31.546 --> 03:15:34.889]  Let's go ahead and talk to Frankie and then David.
[03:15:34.949 --> 03:15:37.470]  Frankie, from New Jersey, give us your take on this.
[03:15:37.490 --> 03:15:39.271]  You say you're government agency intelligence.
[03:15:39.312 --> 03:15:39.672]  Go ahead.
[03:15:44.135 --> 03:15:45.436]  Frankie, go ahead, buddy.
[03:15:46.576 --> 03:15:49.118]  All right, go back to David and see if Frankie comes back.
[03:15:49.438 --> 03:15:51.560]  David, in Indiana, you're on the air.
[03:15:51.620 --> 03:15:52.300]  You say you're a vet.
[03:15:52.340 --> 03:15:53.201]  What's your take on this?
[03:15:54.702 --> 03:15:55.442]  Well, you know, Alex,
[03:15:56.861 --> 03:16:02.924]  Russia, China, United States, European Union, Japan, they all got eyes in the sky over there.
[03:16:03.624 --> 03:16:14.369]  If there is a missile launch with gas, they could take it right back to wherever it came from and then they could follow those trucks back to the dump they got it from.
[03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:19.691]  You know, if they want war, it's because they want war.
[03:16:20.131 --> 03:16:22.432]  They're not trying to defuse this thing at all.
[03:16:23.032 --> 03:16:24.373]  They could make United States
[03:16:25.131 --> 03:16:29.181]  Look like a first-class lying idiot if they wanted to.
[03:16:31.255 --> 03:16:31.996]  Absolutely.
[03:16:32.236 --> 03:16:34.257]  And look, we have the videos.
[03:16:34.297 --> 03:16:41.002]  The Muslim extremists always videotape themselves loading the mortars and engaging.
[03:16:41.022 --> 03:16:42.744]  They've been caught three separate times.
[03:16:43.644 --> 03:16:44.225]  They've been caught.
[03:16:44.245 --> 03:16:45.426]  I mean, they've been caught.
[03:16:45.446 --> 03:16:47.007]  It's not like it's Russian media or whatever.
[03:16:47.067 --> 03:16:48.408]  It's World End Daily, others.
[03:16:48.428 --> 03:16:51.210]  I mean, it's their training videos on their established sites.
[03:16:51.230 --> 03:16:53.011]  They're very proud of themselves.
[03:16:53.051 --> 03:16:56.514]  And it shows the total disdain that the establishment has for everybody.
[03:16:57.734 --> 03:16:59.635]  Well, you know, it's a globalist, you know, show.
[03:17:23.106 --> 03:17:25.068]  He's a little bit backward, I think.
[03:17:25.168 --> 03:17:30.653]  So, you know, he's just probably the number one manipulated person in this whole game.
[03:17:32.175 --> 03:17:33.015]  Talking about Assad?
[03:17:33.035 --> 03:17:33.936]  Yeah.
[03:17:36.939 --> 03:17:40.042]  Well, there's the Al Qaeda rebels loading the chemical warhead.
[03:17:40.062 --> 03:17:43.325]  And they announced they did.
[03:17:43.365 --> 03:17:44.026]  They're very proud of it.
[03:17:46.193 --> 03:17:49.214]  They got the doggone Patriot batteries sprinkled around.
[03:17:49.795 --> 03:17:54.116]  You know, there's no way in the world that they don't know where these things come.
[03:17:54.176 --> 03:17:59.058]  They could take the vibration and tell you if there's a 16-wheeler or a 32-wheeler going down the highway.
[03:17:59.698 --> 03:18:02.399]  You know, it's all energy transfer.
[03:18:02.460 --> 03:18:03.200]  It's frequency.
[03:18:03.220 --> 03:18:04.900]  These people got the capability.
[03:18:05.421 --> 03:18:07.441]  If they want war, they're gonna have it.
[03:18:08.202 --> 03:18:11.323]  They're gonna bring it about, you know, and all together.
[03:18:11.743 --> 03:18:14.044]  There's nobody being duped here.
[03:18:15.498 --> 03:18:16.498]  Russians aren't duped.
[03:18:16.539 --> 03:18:17.699]  The Chinese aren't duped.
[03:18:17.739 --> 03:18:18.479]  We're not duped.
[03:18:19.260 --> 03:18:25.723]  You know, you want to depopulate, you know, you depopulate.
[03:18:26.283 --> 03:18:26.763]  That's right.
[03:18:26.983 --> 03:18:27.343]  All right.
[03:18:27.363 --> 03:18:28.664]  Well, folks, I appreciate your call.
[03:18:28.724 --> 03:18:36.648]  Drink your fluoride, eat your GMOs, give your kids all the shots, and they'll probably die when they're 15, 20 years old.
[03:18:36.668 --> 03:18:41.690]  You'll get to take them and put them in the ground after the doctors torture them for about two years and suck everything out of them.
[03:18:42.449 --> 03:18:43.229]  But I guess that's it.
[03:18:43.269 --> 03:18:45.191]  We just submit to evil and that's the end of it.
[03:18:46.131 --> 03:18:47.152]  Everybody wants to be evil.
[03:18:47.192 --> 03:18:48.232]  Everybody thinks evil's cool.
[03:18:49.413 --> 03:18:50.434]  And that's just the way it is.
[03:18:51.454 --> 03:18:53.315]  And Kerry can go, it doesn't matter who did the chemical weapons.
[03:18:53.335 --> 03:18:54.156]  We're going to attack.
[03:18:54.376 --> 03:18:55.437]  And it's his people doing it.
[03:18:55.897 --> 03:19:00.520]  Like the guy who gave the order, on record, you know, he runs the State Department and the rebels work for him.
[03:19:01.020 --> 03:19:01.800]  And then he's up there.
[03:19:01.840 --> 03:19:03.161]  I mean, it's just so sick.
[03:19:03.682 --> 03:19:06.183]  I'm going to end the transmission now and go back into rebroadcast.
[03:19:06.863 --> 03:19:08.564]  Dr. Coursey's coming up and a lot more.
[03:19:10.270 --> 03:19:15.152]  Kiss your children, Little Lexter, and just all this is brought to you by the New World Order.
[03:19:15.192 --> 03:19:15.693]  Thank them.
[03:19:16.933 --> 03:19:20.355]  And all of you that are into submitting to tyranny, your God is Goldman Sachs J.P.
[03:19:20.375 --> 03:19:20.675]  Morgan.
[03:19:21.336 --> 03:19:30.060]  So I suggest you worship it tonight and thank them for all the jobs you're losing, the dollars being devalued, the open borders, the increases of cancer and all the diseases.
[03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:35.643]  Just thank, thank your lucky stars for all these degenerate bankers and New World Order people.
[03:19:37.128 --> 03:19:38.430]  And this show wasn't important today.
[03:19:38.450 --> 03:19:42.016]  Go watch Molly Cyrus being humped on on TV.
[03:19:42.096 --> 03:19:42.777]  That's the end of it.
[03:19:43.178 --> 03:19:44.800]  But seriously, as for me, I'm going to warn people.
[03:19:45.161 --> 03:19:45.862]  I'm going to expose this.
[03:19:45.882 --> 03:19:47.324]  I'm going to pray to God for intervention.
[03:19:47.725 --> 03:19:48.546]  We're going to change this.
[03:19:48.606 --> 03:19:49.888]  Great job of the crew, everybody else.
[03:19:50.249 --> 03:19:51.971]  Powerful three hours and 20 minutes.
[03:19:52.432 --> 03:19:54.033]  Lord willing, we'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
