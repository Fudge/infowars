[00:00:11.495 --> 00:00:29.756]  While popular patriotic shows like American Guns are getting cancelled, what is slated to air is a new AMC show coming up called We Hate Paul Revere, a sitcom set in 1772 Boston that features two brothers who literally, as the title suggests, hate patriot activist Paul Revere.
[00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:42.161]  Revere was known for his midnight ride through the New England countryside to warn Sam Adams, John Hancock, and other patriots and patriot militias along the way that British troops were coming to destroy colonial military stores.
[00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:49.224]  Why does AMC think it's okay to openly demonize patriot activists who helped found this nation like Paul Revere?
[00:00:50.492 --> 00:00:51.452]  Why is that alright?
[00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:54.694]  And it's not the first time we've seen it recently either.
[00:00:55.274 --> 00:01:01.817]  ABC is set to premiere a show called Founding Fathers, which portrays a fictional Texas militia controlling a small town.
[00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:07.919]  Head writer Rich D'Ovidio likened the main character to Donnie Brasco, an FBI agent infiltrator.
[00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:16.723]  Now flashback to Alex Jones' film Road to Tyranny and this undercover video of a FEMA representative giving a presentation to a group of police officers.
[00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:19.244]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:22.230]  Who?
[00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.895]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:29.778]  You mean George Washington?
[00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.499]  Paul Revere?
[00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:33.142]  Let me ask you something.
[00:01:33.222 --> 00:01:35.325]  Did they try to scare people?
[00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:38.068]  They tried to intimidate the press.
[00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:40.030]  Did they use acts of violence?
[00:01:40.902 --> 00:01:45.226]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism.
[00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:48.930]  The rep tells the cops the first terrorist organization in the U.S.
[00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.476]  was the Founding Fathers, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and yes, even Paul Revere.
[00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:59.120]  So what is the standard dictionary definition of terrorism?
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.542]  1.
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.542]  The use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.
[00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:06.542]  2.
[00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:09.483]  The state of fear and submission produced by terrorism.
[00:02:09.503 --> 00:02:09.483]  3.
[00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:13.804]  A terroristic method of governing or resisting government.
[00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:18.085]  So by this definition, let's take a look at some actual terrorism.
[00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:44.141]  While the establishment tries to brainwash people that up is down and black is white, what's next for primetime?
[00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:47.584]  A sitcom called We Love Terrorists set to a laugh track?
[00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:50.046]  Or an Al Qaeda reality TV show?
[00:02:50.387 --> 00:02:59.555]  In this time of outright attack on our republic and our constitution, what we don't need is more media attacks on our founding fathers and patriot activists like Paul Revere.
[00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.939]  In fact, what we need is more Paul Reveres.
[00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:09.531]  We need 10,000 Paul Reveres to ride through the countryside and warn people about the tyranny that's enveloping our nation at this dark hour.
