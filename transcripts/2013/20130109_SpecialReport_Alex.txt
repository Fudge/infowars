[00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.092]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Ortiz.
[00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:21.657]  They take an oath to protect and serve, yet despite this noble mission statement, the law enforcement profession remains extremely polarizing.
[00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:27.280]  The main reasons for the public cynicism is abuse of power and immunity from the law.
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.442]  Let's take a look at some examples of these abuses.
[00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:34.385]  Meet Officer Joseph Schmidt of the Oak Lawn, Illinois Police Department.
[00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:45.993]  As seen on this video, in 2010, he was off duty at a Hooters restaurant when the then 54-year-old Livia Torres got into an argument with a waitress over her bill.
[00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:50.116]  Officer Schmidt soon intervened in the matter, and despite the fact that Ms.
[00:00:50.156 --> 00:00:57.001]  Torres was clearly not a threat, he decided to arrest her and did so by pulling her hair and using excessive force.
[00:00:57.782 --> 00:00:58.362]  According to Ms.
[00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:02.247]  Torres' attorney, many witnesses say the officer also slapped her.
[00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.251]  Soon after this incident, a judge ruled that Ms.
[00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:11.258]  Torres, and not the officer, was in the wrong, sentencing her to 200 days in jail.
[00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.361]  She only served about 94 of those days.
[00:01:15.103 --> 00:01:16.484]  The judge also stated that Ms.
[00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:19.545]  Torres had a history of DUIs and other violations.
[00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:25.427]  Repeated calls to the Oak Lawn, Illinois Police Department to comment on this matter were not answered.
[00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:29.589]  Now let's take a look at this bad cop.
[00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:40.174]  In 2009, Lincoln, Rhode Island police officer Edward Krawitz kicked an intoxicated handcuffed woman who was seated on a curb in the head after she kicked his shin.
[00:01:41.053 --> 00:01:49.665]  Despite being found guilty of felony battery with a dangerous weapon, the officer was only sentenced to counseling and 10 years probation.
[00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:52.488]  He also resigned after public pressure.
[00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.352]  However, he may still be eligible for a pension.
[00:01:55.993 --> 00:02:04.941]  According to Reason Magazine, one reason why officers are treated above the law is due to legislation called the Police Officers' Bill of Rights.
[00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:09.364]  As a result of this legislation, officers in dozens of U.S.
[00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:12.827]  states are allowed to experience God-like privileges.
[00:02:13.328 --> 00:02:22.916]  Among them, unlike a member of the public, the officer under investigation gets a, quote, cooling-off period before he has to respond to any questions.
[00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:34.029]  Unlike a member of the public, the officer under investigation is also privy to the name of his complainants and their testimonies against him before he is interrogated.
[00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:43.020]  Unlike a member of the public, the officer under investigation is to be interrogated at a quote a reasonable hour with a union member present.
[00:02:44.258 --> 00:02:49.584]  Unlike a member of the public, the officer can only be questioned by one person during his interrogation.
[00:02:50.124 --> 00:03:03.579]  Unlike a member of the public, the officer can be interrogated only for quote reasonable periods which shall be timed to allow for such personal necessities and rest periods as are reasonably necessary.
[00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:13.166]  Unlike a member of the public, the officer under investigation cannot be, quote, threatened with disciplinary action at any point during the investigation.
[00:03:13.807 --> 00:03:19.094]  If he is threatened with punishment, whatever he says following the threat cannot be used against him.
[00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:23.412]  Now, contrary to these thugs, there are some hero cops.
[00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:27.313]  Meet Officer Ivan Marcano of the NYPD.
[00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:34.456]  Last month, the officer was off-duty in the Bronx when he saw two individuals trying to rob someone at gunpoint.
[00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:38.137]  Officer Marcano fired and killed one of the perpetrators.
[00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:40.898]  The other robber and a getaway driver ran away.
[00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:48.200]  However, Officer Marcano, who was shot in the chest and will live, is credited by the victim as having saved his life.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.262]  And here we also have some video of a heroic cop named Officer Jimmy Jalil of the Boca Raton, Florida Police Force.
[00:03:57.882 --> 00:04:01.923]  In late 2010, Officer Jalil was called to a car crash scene.
[00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:09.484]  Soon after his arrival, the car which crashed caught fire, trapping the victim who had broken her legs inside.
[00:04:10.324 --> 00:04:16.826]  Officer Jalil swiftly sprung into action, and after shooting the passenger window, pulled the woman out of the vehicle.
[00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:23.228]  According to witnesses, there is no doubt the female victim would have burned to death had she not been rescued.
[00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.550]  To these last two officers, we salute you.
[00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.931]  Well, that's all for this edition of Bad Cop, Good Cop.
[00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:36.594]  I'm David Ortiz reminding you that an officer is only a hero if he treats you with respect.
