[00:00:11.397 --> 00:00:14.178]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Ortiz.
[00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:33.544]  Well, February marks Black History Month, and during this time, liberals, especially liberals in the African-American community, are going to try to define what Dr. Martin Luther King really believed in, and they're going to insinuate that Dr. Martin Luther King was a Democrat and mostly supported socialistic policies.
[00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:36.805]  But I just want to make the African-American community aware
[00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:40.508]  Of what the Democratic Party really has done to your community.
[00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:46.012]  I'm not saying they haven't done some good, but in my estimation they've done a whole lot more bad.
[00:00:46.472 --> 00:00:51.175]  Yet, the African-American community seems to run into the arms of the Democratic Party.
[00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:54.378]  Over 95% of blacks vote Democrat.
[00:00:54.398 --> 00:00:55.919]  It's truly astounding.
[00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.101]  Let me just run over some facts for you.
[00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:02.264]  Some of them are going to be very obvious, but people dismiss them.
[00:01:02.924 --> 00:01:05.346]  And it's important that we reiterate these facts.
[00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:10.490]  One of the obvious facts is that President Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.
[00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:13.193]  President Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.
[00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:14.714]  He freed the slaves.
[00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:21.620]  Yet you don't see inner cities naming streets after President Lincoln, naming schools after President Lincoln.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.762]  The fate of human dignity in our hands!
[00:01:25.123 --> 00:01:27.865]  Blood's been spilled to afford us this moment!
[00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:28.525]  Now!
[00:01:29.146 --> 00:01:29.586]  Now!
[00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:30.067]  Now!
[00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:39.803]  Republican President Dwight Eisenhower was the first president in the 20th century to sponsor large-scale civil rights legislation.
[00:01:39.823 --> 00:01:41.564]  It wasn't Lyndon B. Johnson, the Democrat.
[00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:46.128]  The Ku Klux Klan started out as a far-left Democratic organization.
[00:01:46.588 --> 00:01:50.632]  Quite often you'll hear ridiculous comments from many Democrats
[00:01:51.192 --> 00:02:00.803]  Who say that the NRA is like the Ku Klux Klan, but they really should open up a book, because if they did, they would realize that the Ku Klux Klan was a far-left Democratic organization.
[00:02:01.424 --> 00:02:05.729]  Far more Republicans, proportionately, voted for the Civil Rights Act than Democrats.
[00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.251]  You know, during this month you're going to see pictures of Lyndon B. Johnson and Dr. King.
[00:02:10.572 --> 00:02:17.576]  It's important to note that far more Republicans, proportionately, voted for the Civil Rights Act than Democrats.
[00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:25.261]  Very few people acknowledge that President Lyndon B. Johnson said the most vulgar things to the black community.
[00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:28.643]  He's touted as a hero, but he said very vulgar things.
[00:02:28.723 --> 00:02:32.025]  Among them, this is a quote, I'll have those ends voting Democrat for the next 200 years.
[00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:32.325]  And this.
[00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:39.491]  You can say that they can't discriminate, but I've got to prove that it discriminates.
[00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.092]  Now, I can't prove it in Texas.
[00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:42.934]  They're white folks.
[00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:51.602]  And obviously the granddaddy of all issues, why I say, sadly, that the African-American community has to wake up out of its trance, is the issue of abortion.
[00:02:51.622 --> 00:02:58.688]  According to the CDC, over 600,000 black children are murdered annually because of abortion.
[00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:06.317]  The CDC also says an estimated 45% of all blacks that are conceived are aborted.
[00:03:06.898 --> 00:03:16.589]  Let's look at what Torey Neblitt says about abortion and how he's thankful that his first girlfriend aborted their child.
[00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:24.676]  In a nation where 40% of children are born to unwed mothers, we are hurting our nation by making family planning harder.
[00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:34.380]  I thank God and country that when I fell into a bad situation, abortion was there to save me and keep me on a path toward building the strong family I have now.
[00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:44.638]  And lastly, one of the many issues that the Democratic Party also supports that, in my opinion, has crippled the African-American community is the public education system.
[00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:52.659]  As a result of this public education system, which individuals like Al Sharpton over here and Professor Dyson say we need to support even more with more money.
[00:03:53.119 --> 00:04:00.701]  As a result of this system, 60% of children, an estimated 60% of all children, cannot read or do math proficiently.
[00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:07.946]  And in the city of Detroit, over 90% of students cannot do math proficiently at the 8th grade level.
[00:04:08.427 --> 00:04:12.650]  Yet it's been the Republican Party that supports school vouchers.
[00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.833]  They've been wildly popular in Washington D.C.
[00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:22.318]  and the Democrats, it's not until this year that they really started supporting school voucher programs.
[00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.521]  As a result of these programs, graduation rates have increased by 20% and
[00:04:28.943 --> 00:04:39.630]  Most of the kids who are enrolled in this are African Americans and studies show that over 90% of parents who have their kids enrolled in this voucher program are pleased with the results.
[00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:46.335]  It's important to note that the Republican Party's love of warfare has also led to the slaughter of millions of people.
[00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:53.420]  I want to leave you with an image of a sonogram of a child who's about three or four months old in the mother's womb.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:01.226]  And I want you to ask yourself, as you see this image, would Dr. King support a party that enabled abortionists?
