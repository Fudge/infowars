[00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:10.683]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.145]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:13.847]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:18.091]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:22.736]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:52.118]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Thursday, May 2nd, 2013, worldwide edition.
[00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:54.880]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.183]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and riding shotgun with me.
[00:00:58.844 --> 00:01:02.447]  There at Mission Control in Austin, Texas, will be Jakari Jackson.
[00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:09.514]  Now, I have a ton of news that obviously I'm going to be getting to here today.
[00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:18.870]  We're going to look at some of the dorm mates now are the new terror threat and the masterminds, the F.P.A.
[00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:26.175]  Okay, we seem to be having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:30.257]  We'll get reconnected with Alex and get you right back to him in one second.
[00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:33.759]  But I'll go ahead and start off with a few things we have coming up on our show today.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.801]  This is out of Breitbart.
[00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:39.403]  Pentagon may court martial soldiers who share Christian faith.
[00:01:39.723 --> 00:01:40.444]  Now this is just
[00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:41.324]  I don't
[00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:10.318]  A comment to the Jack Rich email and it said that the Pentagon does not discriminate against any group based on faith.
[00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.404]  And then I had to ask the question, well what have they been doing to Muslims since forever?
[00:02:14.424 --> 00:02:16.507]  And that's just one of the articles we have coming up.
[00:02:16.547 --> 00:02:18.049]  Next we have police say...
[00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:23.273]  That's just some of the things we have coming up for you on the show today.
[00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:27.675]  I'm pretty sure Alex has many things he wants to mention as well.
[00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:29.256]  Let's take a look at a few more here.
[00:02:41.852 --> 00:02:42.232]  I don't know.
[00:02:57.282 --> 00:03:01.147]  From people on Twitter and Facebook and other places saying, hey, I want to kill Mitt Romney.
[00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:03.750]  If Mitt Romney wins, I'm going to run him over, shoot him up.
[00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.817]  We saw that Michael Moore-funded video where the old lady said she was going to punch him in the gonads and all that was well and good.
[00:03:09.837 --> 00:03:15.905]  But this guy, a guy with a little too much time on his hands and middle fingers, I don't even know if we can show that.
[00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:21.231]  This guy says he wants to kill people and now he's facing 20 years.
[00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:22.993]  So that's that's how the system works.
[00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:24.294]  Let's go to this next one.
[00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:29.059]  Floridians encouraged to report neighbors who quote hate the government.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.984]  Now there's a difference between hating your government and being critical of it.
[00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.547]  We are very critical of it here at InfoWars.
[00:03:36.147 --> 00:03:41.673]  But people seem to equate that with hating your government and some type of violent extremist activity.
[00:03:41.693 --> 00:03:42.854]  Let's go to this one.
[00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:46.438]  IRS to spy on our shopping records.
[00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.941]  Travel and social interactions.
[00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.104]  Now Mrs. Catherine Albrecht, or should I say doctor,
[00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:54.206]  She's been warning about this for years.
[00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:56.268]  The frequent shopper cards.
[00:03:56.748 --> 00:04:02.373]  Many other kinds of perks and benefits that you can get from giving people your special information, secret information.
[00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.755]  And now they're saying that they're going to spy on you.
[00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:05.595]  They just admit it.
[00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:06.936]  Throw it in your face.
[00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:08.618]  Yes, this is what we're going to do.
[00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:16.904]  But, you know, you're a conspiracy theorist if you point out the data mining centers and all these other cookie things that they do to collect your information.
[00:04:16.984 --> 00:04:19.847]  Google, Bing, Yahoo, many other sources.
[00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:23.188]  So that's what they're going to do, and that's what they admit to doing.
[00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:27.489]  Now, last night on the Info Wars Nightly News, I had David Knight on.
[00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.830]  And this is something very important, because we get a lot of comments about this, referring to the Paul Revere contest.
[00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.410]  I just want everybody to know that the Paul Revere contest is over.
[00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:38.191]  We have not selected a winner.
[00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.151]  We'll probably do that around July 4th.
[00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:41.792]  So definitely be encouraged.
[00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:45.192]  If you did submit, just be aware it's going to take us a little bit to get through all those entries.
[00:04:45.492 --> 00:04:48.013]  And we'll hopefully have Alex Jones back on the other side.
[00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:03.662]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:05:03.682 --> 00:05:05.943]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:05:06.104 --> 00:05:12.127]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:05:12.147 --> 00:05:15.349]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:19.371]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:20.732]  The fact is, you are.
[00:05:20.932 --> 00:05:21.712]  We all are.
[00:05:21.953 --> 00:05:24.294]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:05:24.594 --> 00:05:32.936]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[00:05:33.136 --> 00:05:34.357]  Be prepared before you need it.
[00:05:34.537 --> 00:05:37.718]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[00:05:37.998 --> 00:05:40.258]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[00:05:40.398 --> 00:05:44.819]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoods Direct.
[00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:50.841]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:55.583]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:15.278]  At Silverlungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:26.204]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano Silver Solutions, our 2-ounce Nano Silver Nasal Applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:28.706]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[00:06:31.207 --> 00:06:37.431]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:48.558]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:07:01.618 --> 00:07:03.260]  Introducing Pro1.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.024]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:07:07.144 --> 00:07:11.569]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:14.032]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride.
[00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:17.674]  And up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:07:17.794 --> 00:07:28.780]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.462]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.
[00:07:31.662 --> 00:07:35.084]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:40.747]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides.
[00:07:41.007 --> 00:07:52.257]  Herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:57.902]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filter today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:08:04.574 --> 00:08:07.563]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:08.164 --> 00:08:12.336]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:38.949]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday Worldwide Edition.
[00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:47.614]  Again, I'm coming to you from the road and Jakari Jackson is riding shotgun there at the Infowars Center in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:47.634 --> 00:08:49.255]  We've got a ton of important news.
[00:08:50.235 --> 00:08:55.181]  And information that we're going to be going over and covering in detail today.
[00:08:55.642 --> 00:08:58.165]  Remember this story from back in 2002?
[00:08:58.946 --> 00:09:03.551]  Since then it's it's morphed quite a bit towards the towards the Stasi state.
[00:09:03.732 --> 00:09:05.013]  Is your cable guy
[00:09:06.054 --> 00:09:13.237]  A spy was the question, and then it goes into the new TIPS program with the Citizen Corps.
[00:09:13.257 --> 00:09:15.698]  Isn't that nice, being part of the Citizen Corps?
[00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:20.561]  Of course, I've seen all these mainstream news articles saying there is no Citizen Corps, there is no FEMA Corps.
[00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:26.984]  I am reportedly... I am reportedly...
[00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:30.522]  You know, making all of that up.
[00:09:31.783 --> 00:09:54.563]  And then we have other reports here coming out today that are up on Infowars.com dealing with a sheriff in Florida saying if somebody says they hate the government, well then just call us and we'll send some psychiatric forces over there to deal with them.
[00:09:55.894 --> 00:10:16.335]  And of course, this is the new Soviet-style system in America, where you see a repeat of what we saw in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and so many other authoritarian systems, where outside of law, the psychiatric system basically comes in and takes over the society.
[00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:24.220]  And again, we've got Jakari Jackson there riding shotgun with us today, breaking a lot of this down.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.921]  He's going to have some other news reports here for us.
[00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:38.867]  And I have the Master Sergeant David Schmecker joining us, coming up at the bottom of the next hour, arrested for walking around in rural areas outside Waco, Texas, with his rifle, with his son.
[00:10:38.887 --> 00:10:42.029]  And the cops said, we don't care what the law is, we're going to arrest you.
[00:10:42.469 --> 00:10:57.777]  So it's supposed to feel good when the government has guns everywhere, and are wearing black uniforms, and telling neighbors to spy on us, but you don't go outside with your gun, even in rural areas in Texas, or we'll take your gun and then charge you with resisting arrest, even though there's video that your son shot showing that that's not the case.
[00:10:58.277 --> 00:10:59.038]  Because why not?
[00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:03.700]  Again, here's the headline up on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.922]  It says, Floridians encourage to report neighbors.
[00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.171]  Who hate the government.
[00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:14.653]  One million dollar hotline characterizes dissent as extremist threat.
[00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:21.676]  A new one million dollar program led by Palm Beach County Sheriff Rick Bradshaw aimed at violence prevention.
[00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:25.978]  How about preventing the globalists that run our country from murdering millions of people worldwide?
[00:11:26.498 --> 00:11:32.761]  Is encouraging Floridians to report their neighbors for making hateful comments about the government.
[00:11:32.801 --> 00:11:34.382]  A chilling reminder of how dissent
[00:11:34.802 --> 00:11:35.803]  More Tokyo Rose stuff.
[00:11:54.742 --> 00:12:01.388]  Intervention units featuring specially trained deputies, mental health professionals, and caseworkers.
[00:12:01.848 --> 00:12:05.871]  The teams will respond to citizen phone calls to a 24-hour hotline.
[00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:09.568]  Hey, East Germany had it.
[00:12:09.608 --> 00:12:10.388]  It's got to be good here.
[00:12:11.109 --> 00:12:12.530]  But when we do it, it's good, of course.
[00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.771]  Let's make some more excuses for it.
[00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:14.412]  Everything will be fine.
[00:12:15.352 --> 00:12:21.357]  With a knock on the door and a referral to the services, that's adult CPS, basically, to kidnap you.
[00:12:21.857 --> 00:12:22.298]  Indeed.
[00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:24.719]  It goes on, reports the Palm Beach Post.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:38.485]  Bradshaw makes it clear that the kind of behavior which could prompt a visit from the authorities, not the servants, but the authorities, includes anti-government political statements that may be deemed a prelude to violent action.
[00:12:38.585 --> 00:12:40.806]  So it's not just a threat now, it's a prelude to it.
[00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:45.688]  We want people to call us if the guy down the street says he hates the government.
[00:12:46.408 --> 00:12:54.013]  See now, hating the government means, this next statement, hates the mayor and he's gonna shoot him.
[00:12:54.633 --> 00:12:59.276]  Well obviously if someone says we're gonna shoot the mayor, you need to in a very serious call the police.
[00:13:00.077 --> 00:13:02.798]  But see, no, no, no, now it's if you hate the government.
[00:13:02.818 --> 00:13:04.760]  I can't tell you how many people have been visited by the Secret Service.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.681]  They just say they hate Obama.
[00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:08.462]  Or Obama's a piece of garbage.
[00:13:08.782 --> 00:13:10.984]  Secret Service shows up and demands people be fired.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:20.987]  In fact, somebody sitting there right now, their dad runs a car dealership, and the Secret Service came and said, your head mechanic said a little something that he didn't like Obama.
[00:13:21.007 --> 00:13:22.087]  We want him fired!
[00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:26.871]  And of course, in America, people then follow their orders, because they're so scared of the government.
[00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:35.777]  But we want to, we want people to call us if the guy down the street says he hates the government, hates the mayor, and he's gonna shoot him.
[00:13:36.755 --> 00:13:41.917]  Bradshaw said, what does it hurt to have somebody knock on a door and ask, hey, is everything alright?
[00:13:42.317 --> 00:13:48.560]  No, they're going to SWAT team you and maybe get another notch on their belt because most of these SWAT team guys like to hunt humans.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.020]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:55.743]  A SWAT team is going to pull up with a robot and they're going to hope that they get to come in and kill you.
[00:13:56.581 --> 00:13:57.662]  Or maybe burn your house down.
[00:13:58.864 --> 00:14:02.628]  Maybe they can have them dance around the house and say, we're gonna burn it down on the radio.
[00:14:02.948 --> 00:14:06.592]  We're gonna burn the mother effer down, and then burn it down on video.
[00:14:07.053 --> 00:14:13.420]  And the media will say, well they didn't mean burn it down, they just said burn it down, burn that house down, burn that mother effer down.
[00:14:15.225 --> 00:14:18.390]  So, that's the type of garbage that we're dealing with here.
[00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.576]  And again, this is the Soviet rollout with Homeland Security funding everywhere.
[00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:27.563]  I mean, you can type in, your cable guy is spying on you, the phone repair person is spying on you.
[00:14:28.223 --> 00:14:30.647]  I mean, now whenever you've got any of these repair people...
[00:14:31.588 --> 00:14:33.629]  In your office, unless you know them and they're patriots.
[00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:39.151]  You better believe they now are uppity secret agents of the New World Order.
[00:14:39.471 --> 00:14:41.552]  See all the CIA ads on TV?
[00:14:41.972 --> 00:14:43.233]  You know, just recruiting people?
[00:14:43.853 --> 00:14:48.875]  And they're there just recruiting under AmeriCorps and Securicorps and all these groups.
[00:14:49.175 --> 00:14:53.837]  Just armies of clergy response team and InfraGard and just everyone there.
[00:14:53.857 --> 00:14:54.918]  This is the new economy.
[00:14:55.218 --> 00:15:00.280]  The new economy is going to be disappearing us in the labyrinths of the most imprisoned population in the world.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.081]  You thought the drug war was a fraud?
[00:15:02.161 --> 00:15:07.806]  Now it's going to be the secret police war on liberty lovers, and it will actually create the war!
[00:15:08.387 --> 00:15:12.110]  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy to create that actual war.
[00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:16.634]  That is the program, that is the plan, that is what they're coming up with.
[00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:21.885]  And it goes on, the program will also include public service announcements.
[00:15:21.905 --> 00:15:22.505]  This is a quote.
[00:15:22.906 --> 00:15:25.108]  This is not us, this is from the news, with a straight face.
[00:15:25.688 --> 00:15:32.154]  The public service announcements to encourage local citizens to report their neighbors reports the newspaper.
[00:15:33.228 --> 00:15:36.451]  The program has sparked concern that the hotline could violate civil liberties.
[00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.814]  What, that conspiracy theory, the ebony rights?
[00:15:40.695 --> 00:15:44.119]  Or even be exploited to pursue personal vendettas.
[00:15:44.239 --> 00:15:45.240]  Oh, that never happens.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:56.330]  With Bradshaw's acknowledgement that anyone in a messy divorce or in a dispute with a neighbor could abuse the hotline, and that would prompt frivolous complaints.
[00:15:57.071 --> 00:16:00.014]  I mean, they already take your guns just in a divorce period.
[00:16:00.254 --> 00:16:01.355]  It's just done out of hand.
[00:16:01.575 --> 00:16:04.358]  Everybody knows men are bad, but discriminating against men is no big deal.
[00:16:04.378 --> 00:16:05.079]  I mean, men are bad.
[00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:05.720]  We're evil.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.464]  There's enough bisphenol A in the plastics to make sure that doesn't happen.
[00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:12.606]  Your sperm counts down by 80 plus percent.
[00:16:13.834 --> 00:16:14.395]  Just enjoy it.
[00:16:15.055 --> 00:16:33.736]  The caveat is all the more chilling given the research of Florida State University's Robert Galletti into how Germans under Hitler, well it's a conspiracy theory, there wasn't any authoritarianism, because authoritarianism doesn't exist, denounced their neighbors and friends in Nazi Germany not because they genuinely believed them,
[00:16:34.707 --> 00:16:35.007]  I think?
[00:17:05.387 --> 00:17:08.628]  And then they go ahead and arrest him and take his guns and just say, well we took him in for an evaluation.
[00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:12.709]  Because they've got to teach the public, the only power you have is through the God state.
[00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.730]  The only power you have is through worshiping the government.
[00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.071]  The only power you have, there is no individual.
[00:17:18.251 --> 00:17:29.794]  There is only the worship of black uniforms, the worship of black helicopters, the worship of open borders, the worship of checkpoints, the worship of CPS taking your kids, the worship of brain damage and autism off the charts.
[00:17:30.074 --> 00:17:33.717]  The worship of GMO sterilizing rats fed to you and your family.
[00:17:33.937 --> 00:17:41.003]  The worship of scores of GMO crops that have their own pesticide in them that kills the bugs that eat it, but it's safe for you to eat.
[00:17:41.043 --> 00:17:42.544]  If you don't like it, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:17:42.784 --> 00:17:45.246]  That is all there is, is the total worship of the state.
[00:17:45.666 --> 00:17:52.748]  And the Stanford Research Institute studies where they found over 90% of people were ready to kill if they were ordered to by their superiors.
[00:17:53.028 --> 00:17:54.689]  Well, that is the priest of power.
[00:17:54.769 --> 00:17:55.949]  That is the new God.
[00:17:56.329 --> 00:18:01.771]  And you're a heretic, evil demon who will be rounded up and arrested if you don't worship the state.
[00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:04.872]  And you can all have power now if you just join the state.
[00:18:05.212 --> 00:18:06.512]  Join with the megastate.
[00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:07.412]  Join with it.
[00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:08.613]  Decide it's good.
[00:18:08.753 --> 00:18:09.573]  Love Big Brother.
[00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:11.734]  Go to the Chestnut Cafe and cry.
[00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:14.775]  Cry as Big Brother defeats another enemy.
[00:18:15.315 --> 00:18:21.518]  Cry as Big Brother destroys Assad with our ally Al-Qaeda, who's always been our friend and never been our enemy.
[00:18:22.338 --> 00:18:26.199]  And if you remember them saying Al-Qaeda was our enemy, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.462]  And God knows you need to be reported, arrested, and tortured like Winston immediately!
[00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:35.623]  Because let me tell you, 1984 is not a dystopic novel.
[00:18:36.203 --> 00:18:41.926]  It is a dream, a vision of the future, of a utopia world of trampling and being trampled upon.
[00:18:42.981 --> 00:18:43.281]  That is
[00:19:00.737 --> 00:19:01.558]  I don't know.
[00:19:20.336 --> 00:19:21.317]  All of it's for the children.
[00:19:21.477 --> 00:19:31.906]  The UN injecting millions of people in Africa and Latin America and Asia with tetanus shots that make them have abortions at the beginning of the second trimester, miscarriages, and also tends to kill the women.
[00:19:32.106 --> 00:19:33.247]  It's a gift of the state.
[00:19:33.527 --> 00:19:36.450]  It's a loving sacrament of everything good.
[00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.995]  The state loves you, and the state is your God, and the state is going to take care of you and your family forever!
[00:19:42.395 --> 00:19:43.096]  Worship them!
[00:19:43.336 --> 00:19:44.418]  All there is is government!
[00:19:44.538 --> 00:19:54.810]  That's all there is in the universe and you individuals will be trampled and run over forever in the beautiful religious orgy of death and destruction that is the Allstate and pressing on the nerve of power!
[00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.272]  Do you understand, Winston?
[00:19:56.532 --> 00:19:57.554]  It's never gonna end!
[00:19:57.754 --> 00:19:58.595]  We'll be right back!
[00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.637]  Stay with us, you slave individuals!

[00:20:37.406 --> 00:20:43.110]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[00:23:59.962 --> 00:24:05.324]  All the leaves are brown.
[00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:10.726]  And the sky is gray.
[00:24:33.015 --> 00:24:49.286]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here, back live, ranching a little bit, just because I'm so sick of the incremental expansion of authoritarianism and control freak systems, where people build their lives through government and corporations that control the government, instead of developing anything of use.
[00:24:49.747 --> 00:24:52.208]  And then they lecture us all day how we've got to worship them.
[00:24:52.268 --> 00:24:55.931]  It's a cult of government and insider corporate
[00:24:57.757 --> 00:25:15.146]  Minions that I just refused to bow down and worship and then I look at this creepy Sheriff, you know just social worker commissar sheriff Rick Bradshaw and I I look at this guy and I
[00:25:17.765 --> 00:25:25.610]  He's just sitting there, you know, telling us how great it is, that we're just going to drop by and, you know, talk to the person, see how they're doing.
[00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:34.115]  Not off of a sworn affidavit, not off of someone going in and filling out a criminal complaint, where if they're lying, they go to jail.
[00:25:34.755 --> 00:25:39.398]  No, just call the tip line and give us excuses to SWAT team whoever we want.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.680]  And of course they do that.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:49.842]  People constantly SWAT politicians, and they SWAT bureaucrats and people with their own SWAT teams by calling in fake reports on them.
[00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:51.303]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[00:25:52.263 --> 00:25:56.164]  But this is a hungry police state, the biggest the world's ever seen.
[00:25:56.184 --> 00:25:58.004]  But it's here for our own good, of course.
[00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:03.566]  And it goes on, as the professor points out, the program is also
[00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:29.298]  uh... has disturbing throwbacks to how political dissidents were imprisoned in soviet mental hospitals uh... where criticism of the state was deemed philosophical intoxication hey but by the way uh... sounds like an idiocracy where he gets basically arrested because he knows how to talk that's like a crime uh... there in the idiocracy world that reminds me of uh...
[00:26:31.192 --> 00:26:38.917]  What we see happening in this country where, again, we have a government that's still torturing, but again, it's okay when our government tortures.
[00:26:38.957 --> 00:26:46.902]  It's loving, it's caring, it's for a good cause, and it's okay that we have spies spying on everybody and filling out false reports constantly.
[00:26:48.203 --> 00:27:05.336]  It goes on, under Stalin, who nowadays I think should be known as a good guy, I mean our government's adopting his policies, dissidents were sent to infamous psychiatric prisons where they were isolated and brainwashed in order to have their political ideas discredited amongst the general public.
[00:27:05.376 --> 00:27:05.556]  Yeah.
[00:27:06.296 --> 00:27:07.998]  And now they just do that for trial.
[00:27:08.058 --> 00:27:12.161]  When they stage a mass shooting, they just electroshock you and drug you up.
[00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:17.345]  It doesn't matter if you're openly under Air Force psychiatric control in a DARPA mind control program.
[00:27:17.705 --> 00:27:19.306]  Just, oh, that's Alex.
[00:27:20.427 --> 00:27:28.233]  Or if I told you the Unabomber, like I told the reporter that's here from Esquire, that the Unabomber was in the MKUltra program, he just looked at me like I was completely full of crap.
[00:27:28.474 --> 00:27:29.254]  Excuse my French.
[00:27:29.615 --> 00:27:30.555]  Because, you know, after all,
[00:27:31.596 --> 00:27:41.909]  The underwear bomber and the Unabomber and all these other guys, sure they were protected and shepherded by the government, sure they had government connections, but that's no big deal.
[00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.571]  There he is over there.
[00:27:44.953 --> 00:27:46.615]  I tried to get this Esquire reporter.
[00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:51.078]  On the show, and he said his editor wouldn't let him.
[00:27:51.678 --> 00:27:59.343]  And by the way, I didn't even know when I got this guy here to town to talk to us that he came to Austin.
[00:27:59.383 --> 00:28:04.707]  I forgot I wasn't going to be in Austin, so he was nicer to fly up here to Arkansas, where I'm at, and he
[00:28:07.128 --> 00:28:10.650]  He was like, so you know I'm with the CIA, or my dad was.
[00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:11.330]  And I said, no.
[00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.793]  And he goes, well I would have expected you to have known that, because I wrote a book about my dad.
[00:28:15.813 --> 00:28:18.214]  It was involved overthrowing governments, but he didn't like it.
[00:28:19.415 --> 00:28:31.942]  So he's been here trying to deprogram me to where I will accept that Obama loves me and cares about me, and that the drone program is a lesser of evils.
[00:28:32.002 --> 00:28:32.722]  Is that right, John?
[00:28:34.903 --> 00:28:35.664]  No comment.
[00:28:37.763 --> 00:28:38.324]  Oh boy.
[00:28:38.344 --> 00:28:41.427]  So we're going to come back with Jakari Jackson with a bunch of news he's got.
[00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:48.493]  We have several Leanne McAdoo reports that we're going to be going over here as well.
[00:28:49.414 --> 00:28:57.122]  And I am going to open the phones up so that you can also get involved on air with us.
[00:28:57.142 --> 00:28:59.183]  There's a lot of other news I haven't even gotten to yet today.
[00:28:59.203 --> 00:28:59.244]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:14.578]  800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the air, open lines for whoever wants to call in on whatever issue you wish to raise.
[00:29:15.478 --> 00:29:24.320]  So that is just some of the points that we're going to be going over today.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:29.322]  And I was just told about this about an hour ago and here's this article from Salon.
[00:29:30.672 --> 00:29:32.953]  It says Alex Jones Conspiracy Inc.
[00:29:33.013 --> 00:29:34.935]  Conspiracy theories can be big business.
[00:29:35.415 --> 00:29:39.557]  Here's how the multi-platform entrepreneur makes his millions.
[00:29:40.558 --> 00:29:44.681]  And just a classic way to deceive their readers as usual.
[00:29:44.721 --> 00:29:45.721]  Or maybe they're just ignorant.
[00:29:46.021 --> 00:29:46.842]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:46.902 --> 00:29:48.723]  Stay with us on the other side.
[00:29:51.144 --> 00:29:52.045]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.545 --> 00:29:54.146]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.067 --> 00:29:57.748]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.108 --> 00:30:02.768]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:32.188 --> 00:30:32.648]  I think so.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.660]  Spring 2013 for 20% off.
[00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:02.201]  And like us on Facebook.
[00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:04.561]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:31:04.581 --> 00:31:06.502]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:31:06.742 --> 00:31:12.243]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:31:12.443 --> 00:31:16.223]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:20.244]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:31:20.424 --> 00:31:21.624]  The fact is, you are.
[00:31:21.804 --> 00:31:22.585]  We all are.
[00:31:22.825 --> 00:31:25.165]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:31:25.465 --> 00:31:33.832]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[00:31:34.032 --> 00:31:35.253]  Be prepared before you need it.
[00:31:35.413 --> 00:31:38.616]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:41.158]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[00:31:41.278 --> 00:31:45.721]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoods Direct.
[00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:51.746]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[00:31:53.649 --> 00:31:59.917]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:00.158 --> 00:32:02.041]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[00:32:02.952 --> 00:32:06.015]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:32:06.376 --> 00:32:11.821]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:32:12.422 --> 00:32:15.625]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:32:16.306 --> 00:32:17.547]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[00:32:17.887 --> 00:32:21.751]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[00:32:22.352 --> 00:32:24.374]  Go to GetSimpliSafe.com.
[00:32:25.037 --> 00:32:27.419]  SimpliSafe is independent and off the grid.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:31.563]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[00:32:32.144 --> 00:32:38.290]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer, storage unit, or shed.
[00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.412]  Get SimpliSafe.com.
[00:32:41.133 --> 00:32:45.056]  SimpliSafe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes.
[00:32:45.777 --> 00:32:47.978]  So there's no need to let a stranger into your home.
[00:32:48.518 --> 00:32:52.079]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:59.020]  You aren't always at home, but SimpliSafe will stand guard, protecting your property 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.861]  Again, that's GetSimpliSafe.com.
[00:33:04.742 --> 00:33:10.303]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:10.763 --> 00:33:13.304]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.633 --> 00:33:29.217]  Alright, you know this broadcast is not really gone, so most of the time, except when we get our rights or liberties violated.
[00:33:29.237 --> 00:33:35.201]  Like a few months ago, when the police tried to say we couldn't head out in Four Wars magazines in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:36.682 --> 00:33:39.003]  That then, you know, became part of the story.
[00:33:39.704 --> 00:33:42.926]  We became part of the story because the establishment was trying to violate our rights.
[00:33:43.446 --> 00:33:52.713]  But the fact that we've got, I mean, no exaggeration, I don't know, 10, 15 news articles a day the last few months, most days demonizing us.
[00:33:53.914 --> 00:34:01.183]  is really an example of how the power structure is getting more and more desperate.
[00:34:02.044 --> 00:34:03.205]  And why are they doing that?
[00:34:04.144 --> 00:34:08.106]  Well, you could argue that they think Alex Jones is a good way to smear the Liberty Movement.
[00:34:08.386 --> 00:34:08.926]  Richard, do me a favor.
[00:34:08.946 --> 00:34:10.287]  Will you turn my headphones up over there?
[00:34:10.707 --> 00:34:11.007]  Thank you.
[00:34:11.808 --> 00:34:13.808]  Because after you made that adjustment, I can't even really hear audio.
[00:34:13.848 --> 00:34:14.209]  Thanks.
[00:34:14.309 --> 00:34:15.989]  I want to be able to hear Ja'kar when we go to him in a moment.
[00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:17.090]  Thank you.
[00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:23.333]  So what's going on here is Piers Morgan's ratings have dropped to an all-time low again.
[00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:24.914]  I'm going to go over some of those numbers.
[00:34:25.414 --> 00:34:29.856]  All of the mainstream cable is a shadow of what it just was five years ago.
[00:34:31.372 --> 00:34:34.639]  And it is only intensifying.
[00:34:35.741 --> 00:34:36.864]  It is only increasing.
[00:34:37.184 --> 00:34:40.311]  And so they look out there across the landscape for something to attack.
[00:34:40.852 --> 00:34:41.794]  Something to go after.
[00:34:42.848 --> 00:34:47.351]  And I guess my head here in the whack-a-mole game is sticking up higher than some other people's.
[00:34:47.951 --> 00:34:53.615]  And so they're going after us because they're scared to death that people will actually research what we're covering.
[00:34:54.235 --> 00:35:01.079]  So they're not going after us predominantly because they think I'm a kook and an easy target.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:08.144]  They're going because if that was the case they would have me on more radio programs, more of their TV programs.
[00:35:08.704 --> 00:35:09.004]  No, no.
[00:35:09.464 --> 00:35:14.145]  They are going after us because we are becoming more and more effective.
[00:35:15.686 --> 00:35:24.408]  And so it's important for listeners to realize that, and to promote the broadcast, and to tell their friends and family, and to financially support us.
[00:35:24.508 --> 00:35:29.089]  Because Salon and others are going with the classic tactic.
[00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:32.010]  I mean, you've got mainstream media funded by big money sponsors.
[00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.831]  I notice they're funded by Wells Fargo here as I look at the Salon article.
[00:35:36.491 --> 00:35:42.877]  That's the big bank caught laundering $378 billion of drug money and running the narcotics aircraft a few years ago.
[00:35:42.917 --> 00:35:45.140]  That was in Associated Press and even Bloomberg.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.461]  But here they are.
[00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:48.743]  See, I'm bad because I'm not laundering drug money.
[00:35:49.364 --> 00:35:57.371]  I'm bad because I sell high-quality vitamins and minerals and have firearm sponsors and have high-quality storable food so people can be self-sufficient.
[00:35:58.172 --> 00:36:00.857]  Uh, in this inflationary system the globalists have created.
[00:36:01.177 --> 00:36:02.179]  They want us dependent.
[00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:03.381]  They want us on food stamps.
[00:36:03.801 --> 00:36:05.824]  No, we're going to be dependent on ourselves.
[00:36:06.125 --> 00:36:08.388]  So they write an article, Alex Jones Conspiracy, Inc.
[00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.771]  And it goes on to say, conspiracy theories can be big business.
[00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:21.655]  That means questioning known, dying media, known liars, known corrupt power structure that told us there were WMDs in Iraq, knowingly.
[00:36:21.675 --> 00:36:22.275]  The memos came out.
[00:36:22.295 --> 00:36:22.875]  It was on purpose.
[00:36:23.336 --> 00:36:24.836]  Conspiracy theories can be big business.
[00:36:25.296 --> 00:36:25.656]  That's right.
[00:36:25.697 --> 00:36:28.258]  If we build our own platform and become successful, that's bad.
[00:36:28.718 --> 00:36:32.019]  Here's how the multi-platform entrepreneur makes his millions.
[00:36:32.499 --> 00:36:33.520]  His millions.
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.421]  Now, it would be okay if I was making millions of dollars and keeping it.
[00:36:37.768 --> 00:36:43.633]  But did Salon call us to try to find out how much money we actually make?
[00:36:44.094 --> 00:36:44.894]  Well, here it is.
[00:36:45.295 --> 00:36:50.619]  It's good to be Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, the conservative web entrepreneur and news aggregator.
[00:36:51.977 --> 00:37:08.471]  Provided Prophetic, when he predicted in 2013 would be the year of Alex Jones, the longtime conspiracy broadcaster is finally breaking into the mainstream consciousness after a buzzy interview with Piers Morgan and his Boston bombing conspiracy.
[00:37:08.811 --> 00:37:10.793]  And traffic to his websites has never been higher.
[00:37:11.133 --> 00:37:13.295]  The conspiracy business is booming.
[00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:17.206]  So is the CNN's business booming when the bombing happened?
[00:37:17.886 --> 00:37:22.787]  Or is Salon's booming when they sit there and talk about me all day so they make money knowing I'm a hot topic?
[00:37:23.347 --> 00:37:23.647]  Oh no.
[00:37:24.327 --> 00:37:26.108]  And make no mistake, it's a business.
[00:37:26.948 --> 00:37:28.628]  That's not to say Jones isn't a believer.
[00:37:28.688 --> 00:37:30.049]  There are easier ways to make money.
[00:37:30.449 --> 00:37:43.312]  But Jones has built a multi-platform new media empire in his Austin, Texas free-speech systems and reaches millions of believers and promises and advertisers that it will direct lucrative buyers
[00:37:44.312 --> 00:37:47.234]  To you, from a daily audience of active enthusiasts.
[00:37:47.254 --> 00:37:49.857]  Yeah, that's what the sales guys wrote.
[00:37:51.658 --> 00:37:53.820]  I ought to actually write my bio on the things on the website.
[00:37:54.761 --> 00:37:59.805]  And, all told, Jones is very likely raking in millions.
[00:38:00.922 --> 00:38:02.423]  Yeah, about seven million a year.
[00:38:03.183 --> 00:38:03.624]  That's right.
[00:38:04.164 --> 00:38:07.486]  And about six plus of that goes into the operation.
[00:38:07.906 --> 00:38:11.948]  Some of the other stuff we put into funds to then build larger projects and things.
[00:38:11.988 --> 00:38:13.109]  I mean, that's what I'm into.
[00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:18.592]  Jones didn't invent the business model, but he may have perfected it.
[00:38:18.632 --> 00:38:25.396]  He comes from a long line of what historian Greg or Robert Goldberg calls conspiracy entrepreneurs.
[00:38:25.716 --> 00:38:28.078]  And then it goes on from there
[00:38:28.898 --> 00:38:35.001]  Uh, to basically say that anybody that challenges the government is just basically a profiteer person.
[00:38:36.362 --> 00:38:38.683]  So see, it's not good from nowhere.
[00:38:39.608 --> 00:38:50.712]  With literally no money from my family, my dad did help me set up a computer program to take orders online and things like that in about 1996.
[00:38:51.232 --> 00:38:57.134]  And he did help me set up a 1-800 number because I wasn't good at that.
[00:38:57.154 --> 00:38:58.155]  So my dad did help me a little bit.
[00:38:58.175 --> 00:39:04.017]  But other than that, I 100% on my own built Infowars.com.
[00:39:04.637 --> 00:39:07.278]  And in the new America, that's not a good thing.
[00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:15.701]  If you're a defense contractor getting hundreds of billions of dollars a year, you know, to build drones and weapon systems to bomb villages, that's a good thing.
[00:39:16.321 --> 00:39:18.001]  USA, USA, USA.
[00:39:18.501 --> 00:39:34.907]  If you're a vaccine maker dumping deadly Gardasil shots known to kill people on the trials that doesn't even protect you from papillomavirus, their own insert states, on the public and having Rick Perry Lyons say it's the law that you've got to take the shot so they can run the hoax and make millions of people take it,
[00:39:35.748 --> 00:39:36.368]  That's a good thing.
[00:39:36.969 --> 00:39:42.211]  If you're MSNBC that gets stimulus money to give Rachel Maddow raises, that's a good thing.
[00:39:42.811 --> 00:39:53.156]  If you're General Electric, you know, connected to the media, with all its defense contracting and stuff, and so you can pay your news division even when it loses money to propagandize, that's a good thing.
[00:39:53.697 --> 00:40:02.361]  But when you as an individual in the free market of ideas, from nowhere, build your own media operation because you want to restore the republic,
[00:40:03.081 --> 00:40:08.647]  That is the nastiest, dirtiest thing in the entire whole wide world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:19.620]  And again, the reason we are under such unmitigated attack is because we are effective.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.201]  We are effective.
[00:40:21.301 --> 00:40:24.004]  And when I ran into Piers Morgan's producer,
[00:40:25.419 --> 00:40:29.462]  I was told where he was going to be at by the gun range in Houston.
[00:40:29.843 --> 00:40:30.643]  So they said, come down here.
[00:40:30.663 --> 00:40:33.505]  As long as you're polite, you can come in the back room and confront him.
[00:40:34.426 --> 00:40:35.507]  As long as you're not rude.
[00:40:35.547 --> 00:40:36.588]  People said, well, why were you nice?
[00:40:36.608 --> 00:40:37.809]  Because I told the guy to be nice.
[00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.892]  And I went in and shook Piers Morgan's hand and said, why don't you have me on again?
[00:40:42.172 --> 00:40:45.035]  And he said, this is on video because we don't want to give you that much attention.
[00:40:45.335 --> 00:40:47.837]  But I thought if you kicked my butt, if it was this big victory,
[00:40:50.489 --> 00:40:55.173]  Why wouldn't you then want to have me back on if it was such a rout?
[00:40:55.673 --> 00:40:58.195]  The truth is it was an implosion in the hypnosis.
[00:40:58.235 --> 00:41:00.937]  It was an implosion in the trance people are in.
[00:41:01.277 --> 00:41:03.259]  Did you see somebody go, look, knock it off.
[00:41:03.699 --> 00:41:06.542]  You want to confiscate our guns and you know it.
[00:41:07.282 --> 00:41:24.476]  So stop sitting there and acting like you don't when you've been on record saying people shouldn't have guns, and when Bloomberg's been on record saying ban all the guns, and when Obama as a state senator said he didn't believe in the individual right to own guns, and the Attorney General when he was Deputy Attorney General said the same thing, and Sarah Brady has said the same thing.
[00:41:24.976 --> 00:41:28.800]  Stop sitting here talking to us like we're idiots, con men.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:34.184]  Stop sitting here telling me you just want reasonable restrictions, because that's not what you want.
[00:41:34.444 --> 00:41:36.125]  You want to register to then confiscate.
[00:41:36.365 --> 00:41:43.771]  Like, mayors against gun violence, propagandist Mike Martinez in Austin, Texas, Mayor Pro Teum said.
[00:41:45.052 --> 00:41:48.194]  He said, hey, you see that sign out there saying don't ban our guns?
[00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:49.195]  We're not going to do that today.
[00:41:49.895 --> 00:41:54.199]  But what we are going to do now is the first step to making your sign a reality.
[00:41:54.219 --> 00:41:55.560]  So keep that sign, you're going to need it.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.081]  And the whole crowd laughs.
[00:42:00.393 --> 00:42:01.273]  We know the plan.
[00:42:01.313 --> 00:42:02.774]  We know the best thing in society.
[00:42:03.014 --> 00:42:06.855]  We're going to get these guys incrementally while they arm to the teeth against us.
[00:42:06.875 --> 00:42:12.017]  And I want to go to a David Knight piece and then come back with Jakari Jackson to get his take on this and so much more.
[00:42:12.237 --> 00:42:19.540]  But you have heard me in recent times spend a lot more time about what's happening to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:30.025]  Because the system is going to pick apart what we say, they're going to twist what we say, they're going to take it out of context, and they are going to try to demonize us.
[00:42:30.485 --> 00:42:37.831]  Just like when they said, Alex Jones says the government wants to make you gay with juice boxes for kids.
[00:42:38.431 --> 00:42:42.014]  The whole rant showed a bunch of news articles where the frogs
[00:42:42.634 --> 00:42:50.838]  ...are becoming sterile, or having both sexual organs, or hermaphrodites, the fish are, from the runoff of what's going on in our society.
[00:42:51.278 --> 00:42:58.261]  And I've got government documents, like the White House Science Czar's own writings, and Ecoscience and others, about doing that to us, and countless other scientists.
[00:42:58.541 --> 00:42:59.822]  So I know it's on purpose.
[00:42:59.942 --> 00:43:00.782]  I talked to chemists.
[00:43:01.063 --> 00:43:06.025]  They had hundreds of other plastics, just as cheap they could have used, that didn't have estrogen mimickers in it.
[00:43:07.003 --> 00:43:08.503]  And that's part of their program.
[00:43:08.523 --> 00:43:10.484]  They're now proposing putting lithium in the water.
[00:43:10.684 --> 00:43:14.304]  They're now proposing putting men on estrogens to make us not aggressive.
[00:43:14.604 --> 00:43:15.845]  This is engineering.
[00:43:17.765 --> 00:43:20.985]  And this is mainline systems pushing this.
[00:43:21.025 --> 00:43:22.166]  This is the conditioning.
[00:43:22.206 --> 00:43:23.266]  This is the program.
[00:43:23.806 --> 00:43:28.947]  They brag they use soap operas and cartoons in the third world and here domestically to go after the family.
[00:43:29.327 --> 00:43:32.888]  And to remove the man as the head of the household and make the state the head of the household.
[00:43:33.448 --> 00:43:34.748]  And the parents as babysitters.
[00:43:36.559 --> 00:43:38.240]  So we know all of this.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.722]  We understand all of this.
[00:43:40.982 --> 00:43:47.526]  And then they just said it was an anti-gay rant, saying that everyone who's gay is because of chemicals.
[00:43:47.886 --> 00:43:49.387]  Doesn't he know about the Romans?
[00:43:49.427 --> 00:43:50.928]  Yes, I know about the Romans.
[00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:52.810]  It's not a judgment of gay people!
[00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.191]  It's not a judgment of fish.
[00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:57.032]  I'm not obsessed with fish being gay.
[00:43:57.352 --> 00:44:02.736]  The point is we're chemically being manipulated and confused from what we're naturally born to be.
[00:44:03.096 --> 00:44:10.701]  Because in their own documents that we cover in Endgame 2.0, they break down how they plan to do this to break up the family.
[00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:16.485]  Just like Brave New World talked about making people sexless and making them go into fertility early.
[00:44:16.505 --> 00:44:19.407]  And this is what Bertrand Russell wrote about.
[00:44:19.967 --> 00:44:23.730]  Diet injections and junctions to turn us into addled sheep.
[00:44:24.671 --> 00:44:30.776]  And that's what I'm frustrated by, is that we are under massive scientific manipulation.
[00:44:31.176 --> 00:44:32.957]  I don't like being under social engineering.
[00:44:33.178 --> 00:44:35.159]  The social engineers admit they're doing it.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:42.205]  So much of the media is paid government propaganda and foreign government propaganda, and it's the opposite of a free society.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:50.966]  Whatever is the real popular driving force in culture should be in the free market of ideas, the dominant system, and the example.
[00:44:51.026 --> 00:44:52.547]  And that builds renaissance.
[00:44:52.947 --> 00:44:55.649]  That will take us to the stars, not what they're establishing.
[00:44:55.969 --> 00:45:02.994]  Now here's David Knight in a four-minute report breaking down the unprecedented propaganda dealing with the bullets.
[00:45:03.135 --> 00:45:06.477]  Yes, they bought billions of bullets, and yes, it's for us.
[00:45:06.777 --> 00:45:07.238]  Here it is.
[00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:24.136]  You've got even neocons fessing up to what InfoWars has made the public aware of, and former governor of Alaska Sarah Palin has warned that the federal government is stockpiling bullets in preparation for civil unrest, adding that America is finished if it cannot deal with its debt problems.
[00:45:24.176 --> 00:45:26.238]  She wrote that on her Facebook page.
[00:45:27.018 --> 00:45:37.147]  And, you know, now you have neocons from Mark Levin, Michael Savage, now Sarah Palin, admitting that the federal government is arming itself to the teeth.
[00:45:37.287 --> 00:45:42.812]  And the only people who don't know about that now, or who act like they don't know this is going on, is the federal government.
[00:45:42.852 --> 00:45:45.575]  Now you've got neocon Sarah Palin talking about this.
[00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:49.158]  For more on this issue, we go to our very own David Knight.
[00:45:50.439 --> 00:45:53.522]  So David Knight, tell us a little bit about your thoughts on this issue.
[00:45:54.281 --> 00:45:58.484]  Well, the media has gone into full damage control with this after Sarah Palin came out with it.
[00:45:58.764 --> 00:46:02.446]  You've got Politico, you've got Atlantic Wire, you've got Huffington Post.
[00:46:02.766 --> 00:46:06.709]  You've got everybody basically saying these are debunked conspiracy theories.
[00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:08.630]  And they're not debunked.
[00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:09.590]  We're not making this up.
[00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:14.133]  As a matter of fact, it was Politico that even linked Sarah Palin to Alex Jones.
[00:46:14.153 --> 00:46:16.995]  You know, it says she joins Alex Jones and InfoWars and looking at this.
[00:46:18.055 --> 00:46:23.958]  I've got a graph here that basically shows how in the last 10 months the DHS has ramped this up.
[00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:35.184]  And Watson pulled these figures from FedBiz and from a couple of different sites here that are FedBid and Federal Business Opportunities.
[00:46:35.204 --> 00:46:38.966]  This one right here is actually a publication of the GSA.
[00:46:39.386 --> 00:46:43.911]  This is the main source for contractors to get information about what the federal government is buying.
[00:46:44.131 --> 00:46:45.412]  So this is public information.
[00:46:45.733 --> 00:46:47.495]  This is coming from the Fed's site.
[00:46:47.575 --> 00:46:50.638]  So there's no dispute that they're putting out bids to get these things.
[00:46:50.678 --> 00:46:53.541]  The question is, why are they buying so much ammunition?
[00:46:53.981 --> 00:46:57.885]  Well, the media has tried to explain that away with a couple of attempts.
[00:46:57.945 --> 00:46:59.447]  First they came back and they said, well,
[00:47:00.087 --> 00:47:03.288]  Uh, they only, last summer, they said, they started talking about the smallest purchases.
[00:47:03.308 --> 00:47:06.889]  They talked about $174,000 from Social Security Administration.
[00:47:06.909 --> 00:47:10.531]  They talked about $46,000 from the Weather Service, from NOAA.
[00:47:10.971 --> 00:47:14.452]  And they tried to explain it away and say, this is just for practice, this is for target practice.
[00:47:14.812 --> 00:47:17.073]  But we're not talking about a few hundred thousand.
[00:47:17.113 --> 00:47:20.756]  Listen, we're talking about hundreds of millions of purchases.
[00:47:21.056 --> 00:47:25.639]  And when the very first one of these came out at $200 million, people were saying, why are they buying so much ammunition?
[00:47:25.659 --> 00:47:30.082]  But they quickly doubled down on that and bought $450 million just a couple of months after that.
[00:47:30.102 --> 00:47:33.064]  And then a couple of months after that, they got another $750 million.
[00:47:33.084 --> 00:47:35.326]  And then another month after that, they got another $200 million.
[00:47:35.546 --> 00:47:36.867]  And they're just ramping up on this.
[00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:46.470]  Tell us about war, like if these bullets were all, first of all, talk about hollow points very quickly, and talk about war, how let's just say this was all used for war, how long would that be for?
[00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:47.130]  Good point.
[00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:53.572]  You know, when they're talking about it being for target practice, and they're talking about saving money, hollow points are very expensive.
[00:47:53.612 --> 00:47:55.393]  You don't use those for target practice.
[00:47:55.473 --> 00:48:00.835]  So it's ludicrous from that standpoint, if you know anything about firearms, you know that they're not going to buy hollow points for firearms practice.
[00:48:01.175 --> 00:48:09.457]  If you look back at the amount of ammunition that was being used at the peak of the Iraq War, that was five and a half million rounds a month, okay?
[00:48:09.737 --> 00:48:11.878]  So you're still looking at the quantities that they bought.
[00:48:12.338 --> 00:48:18.680]  That would be about 24 to 30 years worth of ammunition if they're fighting a war the size of the Iraq War.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.581]  I think they want to basically starve the marketplace of ammunition.
[00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:26.464]  Because if you've got guns and no ammunition, it's like having a car with no gas.
[00:48:26.704 --> 00:48:36.311]  Okay, it's pretty... And one thing that they can do is they can essentially suck all the oxygen out of the marketplace, suck all the ammunition out of the marketplace with these gigantic purchases.
[00:48:36.871 --> 00:48:51.883]  We found out just a couple of months ago, people going through and looking at the recycling documents coming out of Fort Drum in New York, found that they are not selling their one-shoes brass, but they're turning it, they're spending extra money to turn it into brass scrap.
[00:48:52.483 --> 00:49:03.169]  And selling it to the Chinese as scrap metal, instead of selling it back into the United States market as one-shoes brass, which would help to keep the price of ammunition down.
[00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.789]  Right, David.
[00:49:03.809 --> 00:49:05.070]  Thank you so much for that analysis.
[00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:05.590]  Thank you, David.
[00:49:08.519 --> 00:49:14.784]  Alright, so there is that report from like a month ago, dealing with it, and now there's even more purchases of the bullets.
[00:49:15.084 --> 00:49:21.590]  And remember, they told you that they weren't purchasing any bullets, and we were liars, and they said, okay, we are getting them, but they're not for you.
[00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:35.001]  And hollow point bullets are for target practice, while you just see total training going on everywhere to take on the American people, setting up classic spy networks,
[00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:36.601]  You name it.
[00:49:37.142 --> 00:49:40.004]  And they've always got these ridiculous covers for why they're doing it.
[00:49:40.324 --> 00:49:42.006]  This is 21st century propaganda.
[00:49:43.257 --> 00:50:08.098]  Where in the general mass, they'll have an effeminate police chief up there in a non-threatening way, going, we just want to be your friend, we're here to be your friend, you know, we've come to your planet in peace, uh, you know, here, just, just, just, you know, just take these shots and give us your guns and give us your kids and do what we say, we want to make the world better for you, golly gee, we promise.
[00:50:09.514 --> 00:50:17.119]  And of course I use the analogy of space aliens, body snatchers, you know, as a joke before the New York Times or somebody, you know, says I'm serious about that.
[00:50:17.519 --> 00:50:19.561]  But they might as well be aliens from a foreign planet.
[00:50:20.281 --> 00:50:24.784]  I mean, it's just a culture of people that buy in to being conned by this system.
[00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:30.108]  And the system is getting more and more and more and more out of control.
[00:50:31.329 --> 00:50:34.051]  And, you know, the biggest thing hurting us is the television.
[00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:37.171]  The mainline television, they're dumbing everybody down.
[00:50:37.652 --> 00:50:38.752]  A nation of spectators.
[00:50:38.792 --> 00:50:40.993]  The average adult watches something like five hours a day.
[00:50:41.474 --> 00:50:44.035]  The average young person, eight hours of TV and video games.
[00:50:45.076 --> 00:50:53.180]  And it's just a nation of a world more and more of people that just can't differentiate reality from fiction.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:59.384]  And so they can't even recognize classical flaming tyranny when it's stomping down the middle of the street towards them.
[00:50:59.824 --> 00:51:01.265]  We'll be right back with Jacara Jackson.
[00:51:01.285 --> 00:51:01.805]  Your phone calls.

[00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:03.403]  MyPatriotsSupply.com Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[00:52:03.863 --> 00:52:06.564]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[00:52:07.144 --> 00:52:08.905]  Some people think the answer is gold.
[00:52:09.325 --> 00:52:10.565]  Others think it's a gun.
[00:52:10.925 --> 00:52:12.726]  But the correct answer will shock you.
[00:52:13.306 --> 00:52:22.512]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[00:52:22.912 --> 00:52:25.234]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[00:52:25.514 --> 00:52:27.355]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[00:52:27.675 --> 00:52:34.660]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.643]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[00:52:40.143 --> 00:52:46.066]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[00:52:46.367 --> 00:52:47.147]  You'll be shocked.
[00:52:47.707 --> 00:52:52.430]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:57.993]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[00:52:58.414 --> 00:52:59.774]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[00:53:01.195 --> 00:53:03.116]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:53:03.156 --> 00:53:05.078]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:53:05.298 --> 00:53:11.521]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:14.723]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:53:15.004 --> 00:53:18.726]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:53:18.886 --> 00:53:20.067]  The fact is, you are.
[00:53:20.267 --> 00:53:21.047]  We all are.
[00:53:21.287 --> 00:53:23.609]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:32.193]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[00:53:32.393 --> 00:53:33.614]  Be prepared before you need it.
[00:53:33.794 --> 00:53:36.956]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[00:53:37.236 --> 00:53:39.477]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:49.982]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:53:50.242 --> 00:53:51.664]  And check out their spring specials.
[00:53:51.885 --> 00:53:58.134]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:53:58.375 --> 00:54:00.238]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:54:34.269 --> 00:54:37.772]  There's no turning back.
[00:54:38.373 --> 00:54:41.496]  And what most people do when they go into a tyranny is they make excuses for it.
[00:54:42.156 --> 00:54:52.046]  They rationalize it because deep down they have mass Stockholm Syndrome and are afraid of the system so they make the decision to cozy up to it as a defense mechanism believing it will protect them.
[00:54:53.447 --> 00:54:59.372]  And this will not protect you from this cold-blooded, disconnected, corporate borg that is taking over society.
[00:54:59.512 --> 00:55:04.055]  And the fact that we've gotten away from real American values is why we are now going to go into bondage.
[00:55:04.496 --> 00:55:11.321]  And they will just label bondage as a wonderful new thing, and will label liberty as a thought crime.
[00:55:12.105 --> 00:55:16.786]  And that is where we stand right now here in this constitutional republic.
[00:55:17.367 --> 00:55:29.310]  Don't forget that you can go to InfoWarsStore.com and take some of the steps in being self-sufficient, getting healthy, quality, organic, non-GMO, open-pollinated, non-hybrid seeds.
[00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:32.571]  We have a giant selection of the lowest prices out there.
[00:55:32.931 --> 00:55:40.694]  And when you also purchase from us, it also supports the transmission and makes a lot of people mad that there's still enough money in this country to fund independent thought.
[00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:44.672]  And independent resistance, unapologetic resistance.
[00:55:45.132 --> 00:55:49.334]  We've also got the ProPure water filtration systems, discounted 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:55:49.734 --> 00:56:00.100]  And you can get 11 memberships with the same username and passcode with one master membership for $5.95 a month at PrisonPlanet.tv to see the daily radio show and to see the nightly news 7 o'clock central.
[00:56:01.541 --> 00:56:06.183]  Some of the videos up on Infowars.com.
[00:56:07.064 --> 00:56:07.424]  Poll.
[00:56:07.584 --> 00:56:10.786]  Overwhelming majority oppose California gun confiscation.
[00:56:11.567 --> 00:56:12.487]  New current MO article.
[00:56:12.627 --> 00:56:15.768]  MSNBC guest who attacked InfoWars exposed.
[00:56:16.668 --> 00:56:25.450]  And man, I gotta tell you, it's like a 30 minute interview Rob Dude did with the guy that went up and got in Dambadani's face and said, how dare you ask questions, how dare you say the government may have been involved.
[00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:28.811]  He then went on to say that we said that no one was even bombed at the bombing.
[00:56:29.271 --> 00:56:31.391]  When that's other people saying it's crisis actors.
[00:56:32.211 --> 00:56:33.752]  Which they do have for drills and things.
[00:56:34.952 --> 00:56:37.873]  Where they do these mass shooting drills.
[00:56:38.073 --> 00:56:39.013]  It's not us saying that.
[00:56:39.981 --> 00:56:42.843]  We've interviewed a professor that's saying he believes that's what's going on from Florida.
[00:56:43.664 --> 00:56:46.306]  And he just sat there with talking points, attacking us.
[00:56:46.626 --> 00:56:48.067]  Maybe we'll hear some of that in the third hour.
[00:56:48.607 --> 00:56:49.568]  It was so amazing.
[00:56:50.629 --> 00:56:54.231]  And then they put him on the news like he was a hero, saying, you need to be shut up.
[00:56:54.792 --> 00:56:55.752]  You need to be shut up.
[00:56:55.792 --> 00:56:56.693]  You're mentally ill.
[00:56:57.614 --> 00:57:03.458]  Yeah, let's not ask the FBI, known for staging things over and over again, about drills they admittedly had that day.
[00:57:04.318 --> 00:57:09.022]  And then I said, they'll probably end up being cased by the FBI and basically protected.
[00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:12.012]  And then now that looks like where this whole thing is going.
[00:57:12.432 --> 00:57:15.875]  But regardless of what's behind it, you're going to have your liberties attacked.
[00:57:16.395 --> 00:57:16.816]  Here it is.
[00:57:16.916 --> 00:57:23.261]  Suspect's friends charged in case UMass students alleged to have lied and removed evidence.
[00:57:24.822 --> 00:57:30.927]  They reportedly went into their dorm and removed the firecracker evidence where they got the black powder.
[00:57:31.367 --> 00:57:33.129]  Oh, gotta ban the fireworks now.
[00:57:34.127 --> 00:57:35.887]  Because somebody might blow somebody up with it.
[00:57:35.927 --> 00:57:38.968]  Gotta ban cars now, because somebody might run somebody over with a car.
[00:57:39.288 --> 00:57:46.169]  By the way, they're working on that, making it where, you know, the computer drives, and if you make a move that's not proper, the computer takes over.
[00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:49.070]  Skynet is in control for your safety.
[00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:57.931]  And again, the big story up at Infowars.com, Floridians encourage or report neighbors who hate the government.
[00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:03.012]  IRS to spy on your shopping records, travel and social interactions.
[00:58:03.032 --> 00:58:03.192]  Yeah,
[00:58:04.657 --> 00:58:08.024]  I mean, now the government just basically gets into your bank accounts, everything without warrants.
[00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:08.946]  But I mean, who needs those?
[00:58:08.986 --> 00:58:12.313]  That's that fascist thing called the Bill of Rights.
[00:58:12.694 --> 00:58:14.538]  We need to get rid of that pronto.
[00:58:14.558 --> 00:58:15.379]  And don't worry, they are.
[00:58:16.653 --> 00:58:19.934]  And we need to be like Europe, which they're now moving to do, and just take your bank accounts.
[00:58:20.134 --> 00:58:20.814]  Just take your money.
[00:58:20.854 --> 00:58:21.394]  It's a good thing.
[00:58:21.774 --> 00:58:22.895]  To prop up the big megabanks.
[00:58:22.915 --> 00:58:24.015]  That's a good thing happening in Europe.
[00:58:24.035 --> 00:58:24.635]  Don't be extreme.
[00:58:25.395 --> 00:58:27.196]  IRS to spy on your shopping records.
[00:58:27.236 --> 00:58:27.736]  Isn't that nice?
[00:58:28.136 --> 00:58:32.077]  Fewer Americans willing to give up their liberty to fight terrorism in a new poll.
[00:58:32.137 --> 00:58:35.318]  Well, that just shows the disease of liberty is spreading.
[00:58:35.858 --> 00:58:36.978]  Those filthy Americans.
[00:58:37.038 --> 00:58:38.159]  We'll break their will, though.
[00:58:38.199 --> 00:58:39.139]  We'll collectivize them.
[00:58:44.352 --> 00:58:48.306]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.693 --> 00:58:53.334]  Introducing Pro-1.

[00:58:57.237 --> 00:59:01.640]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.

[00:59:07.884 --> 00:59:18.871]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:59:18.891 --> 00:59:21.553]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.

[00:59:54.679 --> 00:59:56.582]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.062 --> 00:59:59.826]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.397 --> 01:00:10.579]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.239 --> 01:00:12.039]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.819 --> 01:00:13.740]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.961]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.561 --> 01:00:22.623]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.487 --> 01:00:36.109]  All right, coming up in the next segment, I am going to start going to your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:40.891]  And we will get into a lot of the other top stories that are unfolding.
[01:00:41.631 --> 01:00:48.554]  Of course, the war drums are beating even louder for love bombs, humanitarian peace bombs, peace prize bombs.
[01:00:49.374 --> 01:00:53.796]  Maybe they put like pink little roses on the bombs they drop on Syria.
[01:00:54.576 --> 01:00:55.957]  Like they did in Libya, it'll make it okay.
[01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:05.881]  Or maybe when Al-Qaeda cuts the Christians' heads off and throws them off the buildings and our media won't cover it as our government injects Al-Qaeda in.
[01:01:06.701 --> 01:01:11.943]  Maybe if they gave the kids a little chocolate bar before they blow their heads off, it'd make it all right.
[01:01:12.383 --> 01:01:14.043]  Because that's what Joseph Mengele would do.
[01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:16.404]  Maybe that made it okay.
[01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:17.425]  Give them a chocolate bar.
[01:01:17.825 --> 01:01:20.686]  Instead of just with a Luger, shoot little kids in the head.
[01:01:21.564 --> 01:01:22.444]  But he was the state!
[01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:23.585]  He was the government!
[01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:29.268]  Maybe people, if they would have gone along and not fought Hitler, he would have made it better.
[01:01:29.608 --> 01:01:30.608]  I don't think that's the case.
[01:01:30.648 --> 01:01:31.709]  That's why I'm an extremist.
[01:01:32.249 --> 01:01:39.252]  I've studied history and know that 99% of the time big governments create absolute nightmare hells, but see, that's why I'm the bad man.
[01:01:39.272 --> 01:01:44.755]  You can tell today I'm just being a little sarcastic here with the Esquire writer.
[01:01:46.176 --> 01:01:48.257]  I'm gonna be honest, I'm a closet government worshipper.
[01:01:49.292 --> 01:01:50.573]  I mean, I love North Korea.
[01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:51.974]  I want to move there.
[01:01:52.935 --> 01:01:53.275]  Come on!
[01:01:53.415 --> 01:01:54.897]  Hey, John Richardson?
[01:01:55.657 --> 01:01:56.758]  Hey, from Esquire?
[01:01:57.599 --> 01:01:58.940]  Are you a fan of Kim Jong-un?
[01:02:01.342 --> 01:02:02.483]  You're not going to be on the show?
[01:02:03.363 --> 01:02:04.564]  I think he's a rock star.
[01:02:04.584 --> 01:02:07.206]  I think he's devastatingly powerful.
[01:02:07.947 --> 01:02:13.792]  Just look at Kim Jong-un seething with real vigorous power.
[01:02:15.225 --> 01:02:16.666]  Return the map.
[01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.426]  Return what you have stolen.
[01:02:20.787 --> 01:02:22.648]  Return the Constitution.
[01:02:23.228 --> 01:02:25.108]  Return the liberty.
[01:02:25.128 --> 01:02:28.489]  You're in great danger.
[01:02:28.509 --> 01:02:30.390]  All right, enough screwing around.
[01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:33.471]  Jakari Jackson, I'm going to take calls for 30 minutes, then go to you.
[01:02:33.491 --> 01:02:35.072]  I know you've got a big stack of news there.
[01:02:35.112 --> 01:02:38.573]  Tell me what's coming up today while you ride shotgun there.
[01:02:39.286 --> 01:02:40.967]  We have a few new articles here, Alex.
[01:02:40.987 --> 01:02:44.810]  We have Apple avoids potential $9 billion tax bill.
[01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:46.811]  Let's see, we already covered that one.
[01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:48.112]  A couple more here.
[01:02:48.652 --> 01:02:51.834]  Physical by smartphone becoming a real possibility.
[01:02:52.555 --> 01:02:56.377]  Now, back when I was in high school and I had to take a physical, you had to do the turn and cough.
[01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:59.780]  Not being crude, that's just what it was, and I'm not exactly sure how you're going to
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:04.004]  Achieve such a thing with a smartphone and many other things.
[01:03:04.484 --> 01:03:08.048]  I did mention this article a little bit earlier and I want to go back to it if I can, Alex.
[01:03:08.488 --> 01:03:12.693]  High school student faces 20 years for Obama Facebook threat.
[01:03:13.714 --> 01:03:14.355]  I think he should.
[01:03:14.535 --> 01:03:17.678]  I think he should be sent to prison for life.
[01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:19.160]  You think they should throw him in Gitmo?
[01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:22.120]  Well, that's what we get most for.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.141]  I'm sorry, go ahead and get to your point.
[01:03:24.161 --> 01:03:25.882]  We're going to cover this more at the bottom of the hour.
[01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:26.983]  I just want to read this quote.
[01:03:28.264 --> 01:03:29.544]  This is what he posted on his Facebook.
[01:03:30.145 --> 01:03:33.267]  F politics, F Obama, and F the government.
[01:03:33.427 --> 01:03:36.309]  A very eloquent young man right there as you can see on your screen.
[01:03:36.929 --> 01:03:41.992]  Yeah, by the way, that's protected by free speech to say, F the government, F Obama.
[01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.253]  I'll say it, F Obama.
[01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:48.095]  And I use those terms for people who usually have more eloquent lexicon.
[01:03:48.315 --> 01:03:49.636]  But yeah, I should have covered this.
[01:03:49.656 --> 01:03:54.399]  You're right, this is the top story that he's now facing 20 years in jail for talking bad about Kim Jong-un.
[01:03:55.279 --> 01:03:57.020]  Kim Jong-Obama.
[01:03:57.641 --> 01:03:59.862]  Kim Jong-Obama-un.
[01:04:00.042 --> 01:04:02.884]  Oh, and Alex, I don't know if they told you we have the new magazine.
[01:04:03.717 --> 01:04:04.438]  This just came in.
[01:04:04.478 --> 01:04:06.840]  This is the one that has all the free bumper stickers in it.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.421]  I'll tell you what, Jakari, come back.
[01:04:08.481 --> 01:04:09.962]  Let's get into the flipping off first.
[01:04:10.042 --> 01:04:10.283]  Okay.
[01:04:10.303 --> 01:04:11.263]  And then I'll go to the callers.
[01:04:11.403 --> 01:04:14.686]  And I tell you, if I'm in a nasty mood today, folks, I really am.
[01:04:14.746 --> 01:04:15.627]  I'm going to be honest with people.
[01:04:15.647 --> 01:04:16.948]  People ask why I get so mad on air.
[01:04:17.429 --> 01:04:18.589]  I am sick of this, man.
[01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:20.051]  This is freaking me out.
[01:04:21.052 --> 01:04:22.293]  This is freaking me out.
[01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:29.816]  My wife, you know, part of her degree, because she went to school in France, was a semester in Holocaust history.
[01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:35.020]  The real thing, like she studied with the French underground and people like that, and she's always going, we gotta get out of here.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.020]  We gotta get out of here.
[01:04:36.561 --> 01:04:37.401]  We gotta get out of here.
[01:04:37.662 --> 01:04:39.263]  She studied and lived in Normandy.
[01:04:39.723 --> 01:04:42.405]  And she talked to the real French people that were in the resistance, you know, as part of that.
[01:04:42.785 --> 01:04:43.426]  And, you know, studied it.
[01:04:43.806 --> 01:04:45.247]  And she's like, I know tyranny when I see it.
[01:04:45.267 --> 01:04:45.888]  Let's get out of here.
[01:04:45.908 --> 01:04:46.508]  Let's get out of here.
[01:04:46.988 --> 01:04:48.349]  That's something good for Esquire to know.
[01:04:48.569 --> 01:04:50.151]  And that's why this is really freaking me out.
[01:04:50.771 --> 01:04:53.415]  This guy faces 20 years in prison for saying F-Obama.
[01:04:54.036 --> 01:04:54.477]  Well, you know what?
[01:04:54.497 --> 01:04:55.058]  I'm gonna say it.
[01:04:55.378 --> 01:05:00.526]  F-Obama to hell where he came from with his drones and his peace prize!

[01:06:01.542 --> 01:06:08.505]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:26.374]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:06:26.634 --> 01:06:30.756]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:06:31.016 --> 01:06:32.597]  And discovered Young-Jevity.

[01:08:06.555 --> 01:08:07.215]  Big Brother.
[01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:08.916]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:09.637 --> 01:08:10.797]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:11.398 --> 01:08:12.238]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.979 --> 01:08:13.879]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:18.142]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.722 --> 01:08:22.825]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.245 --> 01:08:28.206]  Alright, here's the deal.
[01:08:28.226 --> 01:08:31.909]  We're now into hour number two on this Thursday edition.
[01:08:31.949 --> 01:08:34.171]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:08:34.251 --> 01:08:40.356]  I want to thank all of you for joining us again on this Thursday edition.
[01:08:40.857 --> 01:08:44.320]  It is already the second day of May 2013.
[01:08:45.701 --> 01:08:54.268]  And before I get to one of our top stories today that ties in with all the other news, high school student faces 20 years for Obama Facebook threat.
[01:08:55.009 --> 01:08:57.853]  And all he said was, F the government, F Obama.
[01:08:58.534 --> 01:09:03.241]  Now again, I don't use a lot of profanity, because I think there's better words to describe things.
[01:09:03.261 --> 01:09:05.204]  And I think if we obsess just over Obama,
[01:09:06.007 --> 01:09:31.260]  We actually give the globalists, you know, the upper hand because then when their system moves forward with a new puppet, you know, the next Republican or whatever, then it'll take a while to then expose that guy instead of exposing the people, the special interests that are doing this and that are running over our rights and liberties and trying to codify laws to overwrite our laws, which is completely unconstitutional and flies in the face of liberty.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.842]  So we're going to get to that because, I mean, here's the deal.
[01:09:37.856 --> 01:09:39.479]  I think we've got a duty now to go to Facebook.
[01:09:43.106 --> 01:09:46.728]  And to go to Twitter and everywhere else and say what this guy said.
[01:09:46.748 --> 01:09:48.349]  So we're going to get to that in a moment.
[01:09:48.369 --> 01:09:49.409]  But talk about free speech.
[01:09:49.809 --> 01:09:58.934]  They can censor us on Facebook, which they're doing at epidemic levels, when we sent out photos of the drill, the bombing drill, the police with the backpacks, the military with the backpacks.
[01:09:58.954 --> 01:10:02.656]  The FBI freaked out and said, media, don't look at these at the press conferences.
[01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:05.397]  They had tried to have secret service outside their jurisdiction.
[01:10:05.757 --> 01:10:06.998]  Go and get in our reporter's face.
[01:10:07.018 --> 01:10:08.019]  There's video of all that.
[01:10:08.999 --> 01:10:10.780]  They're really clearly trying to cover something up.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.880]  And we said they'd have a drill.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:12.501]  They had a drill.
[01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:14.962]  We said the FBI and CIA would be all over these guys.
[01:10:14.982 --> 01:10:22.965]  They probably would have been sent as CIA, at least Tamerlan, to the caucuses under CIA programs, because they run all the major terror in the caucuses.
[01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:24.026]  I mean, basically all of it.
[01:10:25.026 --> 01:10:26.227]  The Russians blew their cover.
[01:10:26.607 --> 01:10:27.567]  All of that came out.
[01:10:28.968 --> 01:10:30.689]  Because it wasn't hard to predict this.
[01:10:31.815 --> 01:10:35.276]  Most terrorists stage a provocateur to one extent or another.
[01:10:35.916 --> 01:10:38.697]  They at least open the door up and they use it to take our freedoms.
[01:10:38.737 --> 01:10:40.037]  We predicted that and they freaked out.
[01:10:40.518 --> 01:10:48.440]  And Facebook, we have the screenshots of this and our listeners sent us the screenshots, would not let us post articles linking to the Boston Globe about a drill.
[01:10:50.206 --> 01:10:55.569]  Because they're so scared that if people find out about this, ladies and gentlemen, they're going to discover they knew about the whole thing.
[01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:56.410]  Bare minimum.
[01:10:56.850 --> 01:11:00.713]  Just like the first World Trade Center bombing, where the government cooked the bomb, ran the driver, all the rest of it.
[01:11:00.733 --> 01:11:02.974]  So we're going to go to your calls here in a moment.
[01:11:03.434 --> 01:11:07.977]  But I wanted to get, you know, Jakari Jackson to show TV viewers, radio listeners, you can go check out.
[01:11:08.457 --> 01:11:10.098]  It's on Infowarsstore.com.
[01:11:10.859 --> 01:11:13.981]  The new May issue of the magazine is in.
[01:11:14.221 --> 01:11:15.522]  It will guaranteed sell out.
[01:11:16.082 --> 01:11:17.363]  We sell them in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost.
[01:11:19.446 --> 01:11:20.086]  At cost.
[01:11:20.867 --> 01:11:22.527]  Where it comes out like a dollar a magazine.
[01:11:23.348 --> 01:11:26.829]  Big, color, glossy, the old-fashioned Rolling Stone, you know, version.
[01:11:27.989 --> 01:11:29.710]  Hundreds of thousands of those are going to go out.
[01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:34.252]  We're going to put about 80,000 on the streets of Central Texas from Austin down to San Antonio.
[01:11:34.852 --> 01:11:36.452]  And there are three bumper stickers.
[01:11:36.532 --> 01:11:37.313]  Full size.
[01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:38.533]  Infowars.com.
[01:11:38.913 --> 01:11:39.974]  Save the Constitution.
[01:11:40.794 --> 01:11:47.660]  So there's one that says InfoWars.com, one that says Save the Constitution under InfoWars.com, and at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:12:06.576]  And if you will, especially in San Antonio and Austin and other areas in the Hill Country, if you will go and get these, four or five of these off the stand before other people get them, and put them on your barn, on your book bag, on your car, give them to friends, we can put, just in Central Texas, three hundred and something thousand bumper stickers out.
[01:12:07.076 --> 01:12:08.457]  And by the way, if this is successful,
[01:12:09.278 --> 01:12:14.660]  I'm going to start putting in... I may do three or four pages of bumper stickers in each magazine.
[01:12:15.201 --> 01:12:20.743]  We may try to put 10 million bumper stickers up around America and see how the New World Order likes that.
[01:12:21.984 --> 01:12:36.330]  Because just like the globalists, when they were controlling the CIA and hadn't fully taken it over yet, were claiming they were overthrowing authoritarian countries for the betterment of the world, really they were doing it for standard fruit or
[01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:41.009]  Was it United Fruit or, you know, all these other interests?
[01:12:42.722 --> 01:12:52.487]  We can overthrow the globalists in the mind by calling them on their fraud, by calling them on their hoax, by calling them on how out of control and disconnected they are.
[01:12:52.867 --> 01:13:08.555]  And a big way to do it, just as the French Resistance put up the V4 victory to counter the swastika, we are going to put InfoWars.com bumper stickers up all over America on your business, on your property, on your business sign.
[01:13:09.738 --> 01:13:16.223]  Wherever it is legal and lawful or in commons areas where everybody puts up stickers and things and it's left alone in the bar district.
[01:13:16.243 --> 01:13:20.846]  You know, they'll freak out when we do it and say, how dare them put an InfoWars sticker up where thousands of other stickers are.
[01:13:21.227 --> 01:13:27.131]  The point is, get them, get them out to everybody and if this is a success, it cost me about $40,000 to do this.
[01:13:28.732 --> 01:13:32.273]  I will just pump the money, because that's why they're so freaked out about us making money.
[01:13:32.713 --> 01:13:34.853]  I will pump the money into initiatives like this.
[01:13:34.953 --> 01:13:37.854]  I will pump it into more reporters, more journalists.
[01:13:37.894 --> 01:13:40.054]  I want to hire a bunch of classically trained journalists.
[01:13:40.314 --> 01:13:49.676]  We're doing interviews right now with newspaper editors and other people to come in and help us go over all our data, to help us codify, to help us hire more writers, more journalists.
[01:13:49.976 --> 01:13:51.377]  We're trying to go to the next level.
[01:13:52.257 --> 01:13:57.418]  With me as kind of the whirling, dervish, Tasmanian, you know, patriot at the middle of it.
[01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:04.456]  But I'm trying to build a larger organization to really take on the New World Order and really find the truth.
[01:14:04.756 --> 01:14:06.398]  Because it is a very complex world.
[01:14:06.958 --> 01:14:17.448]  And I, in general terms, know the globalists are distasteful, degenerate, eugenicist-based, predatory scum who try to sell the world on their altruism when it's actually the opposite.
[01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:19.891]  But we're going to drill down into all their operations.
[01:14:20.191 --> 01:14:21.913]  We're going to go after them on every front.
[01:14:21.993 --> 01:14:23.135]  That's what I'm really attempting to do.
[01:14:23.195 --> 01:14:25.198]  So buy the ProPure water filters.
[01:14:25.638 --> 01:14:28.161]  I don't usually plug stuff this much because it's freaking the system out.
[01:14:28.482 --> 01:14:29.583]  I'll start plugging even more.
[01:14:29.884 --> 01:14:31.245]  You don't like me raising money?
[01:14:31.486 --> 01:14:32.207]  Well, you watch.
[01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:36.672]  In fact, if I get a million dollar donation, I will spend every dime on it publicly.
[01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:48.082]  To put bumpers to... $1 million would probably put... I haven't done the math, but it's like $40,000 to get 300,000, 400,000, I think it's like 400,000 stickers total, and then put them in a magazine.
[01:14:49.143 --> 01:14:51.265]  What would a million dollars, how many stickers would that be?
[01:14:52.646 --> 01:14:53.367]  Tens of millions?
[01:14:53.427 --> 01:14:54.348]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:14:55.589 --> 01:14:56.309]  We've got the $100,000, $150,000 film contest.
[01:14:59.805 --> 01:15:07.752]  Just to get a bunch of viral, awesome films made, and then have a winner, and then make films, and then we're gonna put the films out for free on the internet, so they can be seen hundreds of millions of times.
[01:15:07.993 --> 01:15:08.793]  How do you like that?
[01:15:09.194 --> 01:15:12.236]  New World Order, White House-run Media Matters, all you other scum.
[01:15:12.957 --> 01:15:13.718]  How do you like that?
[01:15:13.978 --> 01:15:15.479]  We're not gonna stop, and here's what the...
[01:15:19.051 --> 01:15:28.580]  CIA-run National Review had to admit, they said, if Jones has done anything, he has been the most successful person at creating grassroots aggressive journalists.
[01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:42.874]  Like We Are Change and like all the other groups, they accurately recognize that we have pioneered the idea of citizens, because I've been doing this for 18 years, going into press conferences and asking real questions.
[01:15:43.714 --> 01:15:45.456]  And shutting their lies down.
[01:15:45.896 --> 01:15:49.258]  And they are scared of every one of their press conferences having citizen journalists.
[01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:53.301]  Even if you don't agree with me on a lot of stuff, you think you've got the answers?
[01:15:53.741 --> 01:15:54.862]  Go in there and shake it up.
[01:15:54.922 --> 01:15:55.882]  Don't be cookie cutter.
[01:15:56.103 --> 01:15:58.264]  Go into those press conferences and take them over!
[01:15:58.724 --> 01:16:03.868]  And I want the money to hire 15 reporters and fly them all over the country to take over press conferences.
[01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:05.349]  That's what I really want to do.
[01:16:05.569 --> 01:16:06.730]  But it takes money to do that.
[01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:09.409]  So, they're scared of us making money?
[01:16:09.429 --> 01:16:18.112]  Go to InfoWars.com and just click on the sponsors, support the sponsors, support our local M&FM sponsors, buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the ball caps, all of it.
[01:16:18.352 --> 01:16:28.676]  Just go crazy and just fill our coffers full of money and we will sit there and just pour that money out on top of the New World Order in the most vicious, truth-focused, savage attacks you can imagine.
[01:16:28.956 --> 01:16:29.797]  You better believe it!
[01:16:29.977 --> 01:16:31.838]  I'm going right for the juggler on these people!
[01:16:32.038 --> 01:16:34.000]  I'm foaming at the mouth and I'm not ashamed of it!
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.901]  I'm here to shake people out of their trance!
[01:16:36.282 --> 01:16:37.082]  Out of their coma!
[01:16:37.603 --> 01:16:40.325]  They're now arresting kids that say F. Obama!
[01:16:41.066 --> 01:16:42.367]  You got a right to say that!
[01:16:43.288 --> 01:16:44.869]  Bunch of authoritarian scum!
[01:16:45.450 --> 01:17:01.683]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, Jakari Jackson, tell us about, so get the new magazine, the May Magazine, at cost, or get a subscription, give a gift subscription, every new subscriber and all the other subscribers will get this issue with the three bumper stickers in it, I know we've been showing TV viewers that, everybody else go to infowarstore.com.
[01:17:01.963 --> 01:17:08.349]  Jakari, I'm gonna go to calls, they're all holding patiently, but get into this High School Student Faces 20 Years for Obama Facebook Threat.
[01:17:08.786 --> 01:17:16.588]  Yes, and keep in mind, Alex, just for the context of it, you remember last election cycle where many people were threatening Mitt Romney.
[01:17:16.949 --> 01:17:21.090]  You know, similar to this guy, I'm pretty sure most of the people were just blowing off some steam and whatnot.
[01:17:21.210 --> 01:17:24.011]  Yeah, but they were on Facebook and Twitter saying, kill Mitt Romney.
[01:17:24.031 --> 01:17:25.171]  Oh yeah, they said, kill Mitt Romney.
[01:17:25.251 --> 01:17:30.733]  I'm going to shoot him and I'm not saying that media, don't take it out of context, White House run media matters and people.
[01:17:30.753 --> 01:17:35.194]  What I'm saying is, other people were saying it by the thousands and it was no big deal.
[01:17:35.434 --> 01:17:36.775]  This guy just said, F him.
[01:17:36.815 --> 01:17:37.835]  He didn't call for violence.
[01:17:38.015 --> 01:17:42.377]  Well, he did have a rap song, and most people don't take rap songs seriously.
[01:17:42.397 --> 01:17:47.159]  You had Snoop Dogg recently had the non-violent song that he made.
[01:17:47.399 --> 01:17:50.800]  But I just want to read this one article, or this one quote from the police chief.
[01:17:51.241 --> 01:17:59.944]  He posted a threat in the form of rap, where he mentioned the White House, the Boston Marathon bombing, and said, everybody, you will see what I'm going to do, kill people.
[01:18:00.244 --> 01:18:04.126]  And then he went on to say, F politics, F Obama, and F the government.
[01:18:04.895 --> 01:18:08.758]  And if we can put his picture back on the screen, you can see him right there if you're on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:18:09.099 --> 01:18:13.622]  That guy does not look like a terrorist mastermind to me, but if you've been watching the news lately... He looks like an idiot.
[01:18:13.803 --> 01:18:20.368]  Yeah, they've been saying all night... And sure, fully, exactly, fully getting into it, then a rap song where he says, you're not going to believe what I'm going to do to the government.
[01:18:20.969 --> 01:18:27.374]  Well, that just, you don't get arrested for saying I'm going to do something to the government, you have to actually be planning to do something to the government.
[01:18:27.654 --> 01:18:44.706]  Yeah, and how this happened is, I guess one of his friends at school, or somebody at school, saw his Facebook post and they took it in to the principal, the administration, and the administration called the police, and I guess the guy was arrested and charged, uh, charged and potentially faces 20 years for a Facebook threat.
[01:18:44.926 --> 01:18:51.771]  And many people write many... Yeah, but see the way the media responded, it was F. Obama, what he's really in trouble for is saying, kill people in a rap song.
[01:18:52.031 --> 01:18:53.172]  Oh yeah, it's a rap song.
[01:18:53.212 --> 01:18:57.255]  I mean, how many people has Eminem, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent?
[01:18:57.896 --> 01:19:00.618]  Eminem, Dr. Dre, they're always talking about killing people.
[01:19:00.638 --> 01:19:01.698]  And again, they put that on it.
[01:19:01.879 --> 01:19:02.579]  Well, it's like kids.
[01:19:02.599 --> 01:19:07.643]  They have all this violence in video games and culture, and then kids get in trouble because they're playing with water guns in their front yard now.
[01:19:08.183 --> 01:19:09.745]  I mean, it's just totally disproportionate.
[01:19:10.025 --> 01:19:15.329]  You can't be this big violent empire and then not have people sit there and at least mimic it in their words.
[01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:30.643]  Yeah, just like when you did the report about the kids and the Pop-Tart guns and the Hello Kitty guns and then we went to Toys R Us and all the other toy stores and you just saw just aisles of water guns and dart guns and, you know, dress up like the military and shoot your sister and all that kind of stuff.
[01:19:31.064 --> 01:19:32.825]  It's definitely something that's being advertised to kids.
[01:19:32.885 --> 01:19:38.611]  Even this guy probably listens to a lot of gangster rap music and just decided to imitate it.
[01:19:40.759 --> 01:19:46.644]  Well, that's another thing, is that you imitate what the mainstream media does, and then you get arrested.
[01:19:47.665 --> 01:19:48.626]  It's just amazing.
[01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:49.627]  Jakari Jackson, thanks.
[01:19:49.667 --> 01:19:50.908]  I'll be riding shotgun with us more.
[01:19:50.928 --> 01:19:52.370]  I'm going to come back and take phone calls.
[01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:55.292]  And then Schmecker's coming on, and I'll continue to take phone calls.
[01:19:55.773 --> 01:19:57.975]  I am wound up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:58.295 --> 01:19:59.136]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:59.216 --> 01:20:00.397]  InfoWars.com.

[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:17.661]  Have you ever experienced missized jeans from China?
[01:20:18.041 --> 01:20:19.661]  Well, you won't with diamond gusset.
[01:20:20.241 --> 01:20:24.642]  Every pair is crafted to fit exactly the same and always feel like they were custom made.
[01:20:25.322 --> 01:20:26.162]  Need a 35, 37, or 39 waist?

[01:21:24.347 --> 01:21:25.768]  Remember last year's dry conditions?

[01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:04.148]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[01:22:04.488 --> 01:22:07.769]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:22:07.849 --> 01:22:10.690]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:21.652]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[01:22:21.752 --> 01:22:22.813]  Then there's affordability.

[01:22:55.814 --> 01:23:04.920]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.722]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:08.622 --> 01:23:16.967]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:17.588 --> 01:23:22.491]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:23.121 --> 01:23:34.092]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:23:34.493 --> 01:23:41.500]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:46.443]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:23:46.483 --> 01:23:49.645]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:23:50.085 --> 01:23:57.030]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:23:57.330 --> 01:23:58.331]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:58.611 --> 01:23:59.632]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:17.734 --> 01:24:21.216]  Oh, it's good to hear George Strait's voice.
[01:24:21.337 --> 01:24:22.878]  Girl, your memory.
[01:24:22.898 --> 01:24:23.878]  Won't ever haunt me.
[01:24:23.898 --> 01:24:25.299]  Got some oceanfront property.
[01:24:50.769 --> 01:24:58.314]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:24:58.394 --> 01:25:12.902]  I had Master Sergeant David Schmecker, who of course was arrested and his video has been seen, I don't know how many tens of millions of times online, out in rural Central Texas on a marching with his son.
[01:25:15.891 --> 01:25:16.872]  No, no, no, no.
[01:25:17.192 --> 01:25:20.095]  Master Sergeant David Schmecker was arrested outside Waco, CJ.
[01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:22.057]  He sure was.
[01:25:23.358 --> 01:25:23.859]  Absolutely.
[01:25:23.899 --> 01:25:25.460]  CJ just popped in and said Connecticut.
[01:25:25.741 --> 01:25:27.943]  And that's good, because I have the guys pop in occasionally.
[01:25:32.771 --> 01:25:37.053]  Oh, David Schmecker was another guy who was in Connecticut.
[01:25:37.734 --> 01:25:44.477]  Yes, because I kept telling you guys that I wanted to get the Master Sergeant back on the radio show.
[01:25:44.497 --> 01:25:47.559]  Man, this has been one hell of a trip being out of town.
[01:25:48.699 --> 01:25:50.080]  I will tell you that right now.
[01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:54.362]  Let's go ahead and go to phone calls here.
[01:25:55.263 --> 01:25:57.984]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charles in Michigan.
[01:25:58.024 --> 01:25:58.925]  You're on the air, Charles.
[01:26:00.225 --> 01:26:01.046]  Hey, good day Alex.
[01:26:02.981 --> 01:26:07.943]  I wanted to talk about trying, maybe trying to expand InfoWars a little bit.
[01:26:07.963 --> 01:26:09.084]  I got two issues.
[01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:19.187]  First issue, you should try to get David Knight and Jakari Jackson, their own syndicated radio show, maybe a little bit later on in the day across the nation so more people can get the word of InfoWars out.
[01:26:22.689 --> 01:26:23.249]  Say that again?
[01:26:24.508 --> 01:26:29.211]  I said, uh, you should try to get, uh, David Knight and Jakari Jackson, because they're really good together.
[01:26:29.231 --> 01:26:33.114]  Uh, you should try to get them their own syndicated radio show associated with InfoWars.
[01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:39.798]  You know, like our non-local radio stations?
[01:26:41.219 --> 01:26:42.880]  Yeah, I don't really understand what you're saying, man.
[01:26:44.321 --> 01:26:51.023]  Do you know how you've got your radio shows on local radio stations and everything?
[01:26:51.303 --> 01:26:57.965]  Well, I was saying you should try to get them to get their own show on local radio stations later on in the day.
[01:26:58.526 --> 01:27:05.488]  So, you know, when people are driving their car, they flip through on their way home at 6, 7 o'clock at night, they can hear Jakari Jackson and David Knight on.
[01:27:07.079 --> 01:27:08.640]  Yeah, it doesn't really work like that.
[01:27:09.561 --> 01:27:19.090]  We're starting a news operation and then we do plan to do radio down the road, but it's not as easy as you think to just start shows and then syndicate them.
[01:27:20.852 --> 01:27:24.135]  Second issue I wanted to talk about was Michael Savage.
[01:27:25.179 --> 01:27:33.548]  I was kind of thrown back by you kind of promoting him because he never mentioned anything about him or even the day of the show.
[01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:36.591]  I listened to him to see if he mentioned he was on your show.
[01:27:36.631 --> 01:27:37.813]  He never mentioned you once.
[01:27:39.595 --> 01:27:42.217]  His backstory is something else.
[01:27:42.237 --> 01:27:44.640]  He used to hang out with Allen Ginsberg back in the 60s.
[01:27:45.971 --> 01:27:59.870]  Yeah, well he says that stuff that's been said about him and that is not true and Paul Watson does listen to the show and does say that he plugs in for wars and said that he said that we should ask questions about the drill at the bombing.
[01:28:00.691 --> 01:28:01.912]  I don't listen to Savage a lot.
[01:28:01.932 --> 01:28:05.455]  I mean, I think compared to a lot of the other people on Talk Radio, he raises some important points.
[01:28:05.875 --> 01:28:07.276]  I don't agree with some of what he says.
[01:28:07.296 --> 01:28:26.071]  I just had him on the show because they were trying to basically black out his book about communist Chinese influence in our media, which we're seeing more and more with Iron Man and World War Z and the remake of Red Dawn.
[01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:29.353]  They cut that as well.
[01:28:31.334 --> 01:28:33.679]  Uh, so, so, that's just some of what's going on.
[01:28:36.872 --> 01:28:55.685]  A lot of times, you know, like, he was on another day, or a couple weeks ago, and he said he'd seen a Muslim woman going into a store, and he said, uh, oh, and I looked into her eyes, and I'd seen the devil, because Islam's the devil, and he's really a hate-monger, and, uh, he wasn't as bad before he got fired, and then when he was picked up by Cumulus, it's like he sold his soul.
[01:28:56.526 --> 01:29:00.208]  And, uh, he... Yeah, I don't, uh, Michael Savage was not fired.
[01:29:00.389 --> 01:29:03.010]  Michael Savage got out of his contract with Talk Radio Network.
[01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.631]  That's on record.
[01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:08.969]  Okay, but when he got picked up with Cumulus, everything changed because he used to be a lot better.
[01:29:08.989 --> 01:29:13.634]  He seemed to have went downhill, and I personally think he works for Globalist.
[01:29:16.001 --> 01:29:18.383]  Well, I tell you what, next time we get him on we'll open the phones up.
[01:29:18.423 --> 01:29:18.983]  How's that sound?
[01:29:19.003 --> 01:29:19.904]  You can tell him that.
[01:29:20.444 --> 01:29:22.726]  I mean, I gotta be honest with you, I'm not really paying attention.
[01:29:23.447 --> 01:29:24.768]  I mean, I read the news and stuff.
[01:29:24.788 --> 01:29:27.770]  I listen to him sometimes when I'm driving in the car in the afternoon.
[01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:32.293]  But I mean, I just think we've got bigger fish to fry than talking to other talk show hosts.
[01:29:32.614 --> 01:29:36.256]  I mean, I try to not even talk about Glenn Beck bad when he's bashing me because it just doesn't even...
[01:29:37.097 --> 01:29:38.538]  It's just unending.
[01:29:38.739 --> 01:29:41.341]  We're going to take more calls when we come back.
[01:29:41.361 --> 01:29:44.343]  Again, I'm here on the road today, all over the map.
[01:29:44.844 --> 01:29:46.285]  Overall, an informative broadcast.
[01:29:46.325 --> 01:29:47.966]  News Blitz with Jakari Jackson coming up.
[01:29:50.949 --> 01:29:51.849]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:53.951]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:30:05.825 --> 01:30:06.745]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:07.065 --> 01:30:10.987]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:11.007 --> 01:30:13.227]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:18.669]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:25.371]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:25.771 --> 01:30:31.333]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:31.753 --> 01:30:35.434]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.934 --> 01:30:39.917]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:40.217 --> 01:30:45.721]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:46.161 --> 01:30:49.163]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:49.724 --> 01:30:51.145]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:51.685 --> 01:30:52.185]  It's here.

[01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:55.334]  See them on the web www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:19.355]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:33:23.577 --> 01:33:26.218]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:40.717 --> 01:33:42.799]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:46.103]  And my philosophy is very, very simple.
[01:33:46.483 --> 01:33:52.890]  Whatever the globalists promote, whatever they push, with all their excuses and reasons, I oppose, I resist.
[01:33:53.631 --> 01:33:55.633]  If they're for open borders, I'm against it.
[01:33:55.693 --> 01:33:58.236]  If they're for taking my guns, I'm against it.
[01:33:58.256 --> 01:34:01.099]  If they're against the family, I'm against them.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.682]  If they are against national sovereignty, I stand against that.
[01:34:06.982 --> 01:34:26.992]  That's a good place to start, and then you can go through each one of those topics and issues and see how there's a global corporate government forming that is above the law and exempts itself from its own laws that it foisted onto us, and that is not trying to build a better world, altruistically as they claim, but that is trying to secure
[01:34:28.109 --> 01:34:33.281]  They're ill-gotten gains that predominantly come through fractional reserve banking.
[01:34:34.484 --> 01:34:37.892]  Fractional reserve banking.
[01:34:38.854 --> 01:34:45.396]  Where these select groups are allowed to basically create all the currency and credit they want and then loan it out to you on interest.
[01:34:46.116 --> 01:34:49.177]  Well, if you can loan out unlimited money and interest, what are you really looking for?
[01:34:49.237 --> 01:34:50.398]  More fiat money back?
[01:34:50.858 --> 01:34:58.080]  No, you're looking for people to get overextended, domesticated, in debt, and then collapse the society to consolidate it.
[01:35:00.201 --> 01:35:02.022]  Like the Willie Nelson song with the highwayman.
[01:35:02.562 --> 01:35:05.923]  The bankman tells me he likes me, says he's my friend.
[01:35:09.059 --> 01:35:10.180]  But he ain't my friend.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:13.882]  I forget the exact words of the song, but that's basically it.
[01:35:14.403 --> 01:35:16.104]  You know, Bankman says he likes me.
[01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:18.406]  No, that's not what's going on.
[01:35:18.786 --> 01:35:23.109]  Now, is that saying there might be a corner banker who's a nice guy and actually tries to take risk and loan people money?
[01:35:23.469 --> 01:35:23.749]  Yeah.
[01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:30.114]  But it's the little banks that aren't allowed to basically engage in all the same type of creative bookkeeping the big banks can do.
[01:35:30.794 --> 01:35:42.180]  And all those trillions in 0% interest money that the Federal Reserve has created for its member banks, it's loaning you out that money at sometimes 30, 40, 50% interest.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:53.906]  They've gotten rid of the usury laws in this country, or they've reversed them depending on the state, where now corporations have protection from usury, but individuals don't.
[01:35:55.612 --> 01:36:08.580]  You go up to these poor people that don't know what they're doing, and you say, oh, I'll give you this loan, it's real good, and it turns out to be like 30% compounded interest, and you ruin that person's life and make them a debt slave, and then you call that free market.
[01:36:10.121 --> 01:36:14.803]  And then meanwhile, if you criticize those big banks, you are anti-establishment.
[01:36:14.883 --> 01:36:16.424]  You hate the government.
[01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:17.665]  You are an extremist.
[01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:21.828]  Our government, more and more, is a collection of private central banks.
[01:36:22.853 --> 01:36:23.253]  Hey, thanks.
[01:36:23.313 --> 01:36:24.394]  Great show today.
[01:36:43.391 --> 01:36:49.879]  And you know what, it's really amazing to watch all of this unfold since the Boston bombing.
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.543]  As you know, back in 9-11, I wasn't awake yet.
[01:36:52.983 --> 01:37:01.134]  And to watch you guys break everything down and just be on their heels, it's something really inspiring.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:20.271]  Yeah, it is historic that we were able to get on the bombing day one and that the drill came out of the bombs and the guys being cased by the FBI and CIA connections and Russia blowing their cover and killing the one brother and tape of them saying, don't shoot, don't shoot.
[01:37:21.472 --> 01:37:24.214]  You know, all the rest of it, you know, we didn't do it, we didn't do it.
[01:37:24.254 --> 01:37:35.303]  The other brother, climbing out of the boat, not shot in the throat, and then minutes later, barely can't, you know, and, and, and, you know, all bloody, can't talk, and then saying he confesses from his hospital bed.
[01:37:35.644 --> 01:37:42.830]  When in the American system, or any other free system, have you ever had the person in the hospital bed, and they leak that he's confessed?
[01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:45.532]  So that you prejudice everyone.
[01:37:46.693 --> 01:37:47.414]  I mean, I hope they don't
[01:37:50.502 --> 01:37:55.326]  Put me in the hospital, cut my larynx out, cut my vocal cords out, then say, Alex confesses!
[01:37:56.066 --> 01:37:58.968]  You know, oh yeah, I mean, why not just torture people right there in the courtroom?
[01:37:59.289 --> 01:38:02.091]  They already drug people now in the courtroom to make them quote, tell the truth.
[01:38:02.611 --> 01:38:05.053]  Why don't they have electroshock therapy right up on the stage?
[01:38:05.333 --> 01:38:11.838]  I mean, they already... Guys, pull this up, because I was telling the reporter this earlier, he didn't believe me, and I don't blame him, it's so crazy.
[01:38:12.378 --> 01:38:17.022]  Pull up a court rules taser can be used to make you answer questions.
[01:38:17.542 --> 01:38:18.463]  I'm sorry, caller, go ahead.
[01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:25.215]  Yeah, you know, I just want to say real quick, I was talking to my oldest son last night, who's still down in the L.A.
[01:38:25.335 --> 01:38:25.655]  area.
[01:38:25.675 --> 01:38:36.359]  You know, he's 15, and he thinks it's all rigged inside jobs, but they're not fooling anybody.
[01:38:37.059 --> 01:38:38.340]  And the word is getting out.
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:47.823]  So, a couple things that I wanted to cover was a local story that happened here.
[01:38:51.816 --> 01:39:02.264]  I think it was the day of the bombing, so I've been waiting for all this to kind of go over so I could call about this.
[01:39:03.045 --> 01:39:07.328]  Now, that gentleman, Mr. Downing, who was tasered and killed,
[01:39:13.011 --> 01:39:18.895]  There's a lot of things that they're really not talking about in that news article that you got from the local paper here.
[01:39:23.237 --> 01:39:30.561]  My wife actually worked with Mr. Downing at the assisted living home before he was transferred to the VA home.
[01:39:31.842 --> 01:39:34.683]  And my mother actually works at the VA home.
[01:39:35.304 --> 01:39:41.367]  And so I know for a fact that the residents there are actually allowed to leave and go about their business.
[01:39:42.045 --> 01:39:45.046]  As long as they know that they're going to make their way back.
[01:39:45.486 --> 01:39:51.628]  So, for them to report that he was running away, first of all, is a lie.
[01:39:52.388 --> 01:39:58.730]  And, um, you know... Now, for those who don't know about the case, it's funny that I mentioned Taser, because that's what you called about.
[01:40:00.711 --> 01:40:03.672]  That's the case where they squat on him for like 10 minutes and beat him to death, right?
[01:40:03.692 --> 01:40:04.492]  And break his neck?
[01:40:06.632 --> 01:40:08.573]  Uh, they tasered him and made him fall.
[01:40:08.593 --> 01:40:11.614]  And then he was the son, he was actually the son of a cop, too, right?
[01:40:13.904 --> 01:40:14.384]  I'm not sure.
[01:40:14.404 --> 01:40:17.726]  I know he's a World War II veteran, I believe.
[01:40:19.366 --> 01:40:31.271]  I mean, there's so many people they taser and kill, but I mean, I saw the case in Southern California with the schizophrenic guy whose dad was the cop who they absolutely beat to death, and they sat there and then squatted on him and killed him.
[01:40:32.172 --> 01:40:34.993]  And, I mean, that's just what goes on.
[01:40:35.753 --> 01:40:39.074]  And, you know, my point on the tasers is this is all part of paying compliance.
[01:40:39.115 --> 01:40:40.375]  But go ahead and get to the point.
[01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:42.536]  I mean, what specifically are you saying about this case?
[01:40:43.444 --> 01:41:05.747]  Well, you know, I just would like to get your opinion on what to do to stand up to local tyranny because I've never done this before and I have serious issues with the local police force and the way they're acting along with the local
[01:41:08.373 --> 01:41:13.038]  Well, this is how police act in a third world country, and America is by and large now a third world country.
[01:41:14.099 --> 01:41:15.300]  And it's going to get worse, man.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.062]  I mean, look, people want status.
[01:41:17.763 --> 01:41:20.366]  And the ultimate status in a tyranny is the uniform.
[01:41:20.546 --> 01:41:21.807]  This is the worship of the uniform.
[01:41:21.847 --> 01:41:23.068]  This is the North
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.103]  Korea-tization of our republic.
[01:41:27.704 --> 01:41:30.446]  And I would go to city council and talk about what you're seeing the police do.
[01:41:30.627 --> 01:41:32.749]  I would go a hundred times.
[01:41:33.209 --> 01:41:36.273]  I would run for office and bring it up in the debates.
[01:41:36.853 --> 01:41:39.116]  I would form a citizens group that films the police.
[01:41:39.997 --> 01:41:42.980]  And you will end up reforming them in the long term.
[01:41:44.401 --> 01:41:50.143]  What has an effect is just, you know, the Chinese water torture of just drip, drip, drip, never stopping.
[01:41:50.183 --> 01:41:52.244]  I appreciate your call, man.
[01:41:52.264 --> 01:41:52.744]  Good points.
[01:41:54.065 --> 01:41:57.846]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rodney in California.
[01:41:57.866 --> 01:41:59.527]  His kids have been taken away, he says.
[01:41:59.927 --> 01:42:01.587]  He's watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:42:01.747 --> 01:42:02.608]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:42:04.348 --> 01:42:05.989]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:42:06.189 --> 01:42:08.290]  It's a little bit of confusion.
[01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:10.991]  This is Rodney, but I was calling about the
[01:42:12.452 --> 01:42:14.593]  About the kids that were taken away in California.
[01:42:14.653 --> 01:42:16.154]  I'm calling you from Paris, France.
[01:42:17.095 --> 01:42:23.299]  So it's interesting that you were talking about France a little bit earlier on, and by the way... Yeah, that's funny.
[01:42:23.339 --> 01:42:26.021]  My screen said, yeah, kids taken away.
[01:42:26.041 --> 01:42:30.783]  I guess you're speaking about kids being taken away in California, and you're calling from France.
[01:42:30.803 --> 01:42:31.284]  So go ahead.
[01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.950]  Exactly.
[01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:46.294]  And, well, you know, I heard you speaking the other day, and just saying that you had that, you know, that feeling in your stomach, you know, when you saw, you know, that video about those people getting their kids taken away.
[01:42:46.814 --> 01:42:53.436]  Exactly what you mean, because, I mean, it was absolutely, exactly the same thing for me when I watched that video feed.
[01:42:54.376 --> 01:43:09.126]  And I need to, you know, and this follows also the, you know, the things that happened in Florida as well with the, you know, with the parents that they found a little bit of marijuana on and they took their kids to, it's just, that's just incredible for me.
[01:43:09.766 --> 01:43:11.347]  And, you know, I left the U.S.
[01:43:11.767 --> 01:43:20.093]  13 years ago, I go back, you know, several times a year of it, but, you know, I'll be honest with you, with all the stuff that I see, you know,
[01:43:20.573 --> 01:43:29.820]  And on YouTube and stuff for police brutality that I've been checking out since I've been awake, you know, it's actually very scary.
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:38.566]  And I need to call you out on something because, you know, I'm not advocating violence in any way, shape or form.
[01:43:39.186 --> 01:43:46.211]  But honestly, Alex, I mean, from your heart, if that was you and you were at your
[01:43:47.077 --> 01:43:53.883]  And some police and children's services came to your house and tried to take your kids away from you.
[01:43:54.403 --> 01:43:55.224]  What would you do?
[01:43:57.065 --> 01:44:00.368]  By the way, I haven't even played that video yet.
[01:44:00.948 --> 01:44:03.510]  I sent it to Chris on Monday and I never got to it.
[01:44:04.231 --> 01:44:06.493]  Guys, will you pull up that four minute video?
[01:44:06.613 --> 01:44:09.175]  It was in Don Salazar's article.
[01:44:10.095 --> 01:44:14.139]  And I've since turned on the television and saw it on national TV where the couple
[01:44:14.699 --> 01:44:27.164]  Didn't like the hospital care they were getting, and so they took their child to another hospital, so the cops came and attacked and knocked the dad down in his house, and then say, you're gonna give me that baby, and then take it away, and it's just, they're just nuts!
[01:44:27.244 --> 01:44:43.371]  It's the family courts, where there's no due process, uh, they can do basically, uh, whatever you, whatever, you know, they want to us, and yeah, it did make me physically ill, and then you say, you're calling me out, because,
[01:44:45.032 --> 01:44:46.873]  I'm not calling for violence.
[01:44:47.553 --> 01:44:52.376]  I'm calling you out, but I'm not calling you out because you're not calling for violence.
[01:44:52.836 --> 01:44:54.177]  But what would you do?
[01:44:55.458 --> 01:44:58.780]  Number one, I would know how to talk to the scum at the hospital.
[01:45:00.499 --> 01:45:09.366]  And say, look, I know you criminals kidnap kids all day, and you're on power trips, and you're little authoritarians, just like the Stanford University study.
[01:45:09.846 --> 01:45:11.348]  You'd follow any order, you were told.
[01:45:12.288 --> 01:45:14.690]  But you've engaged in malpractice here.
[01:45:15.051 --> 01:45:16.212]  You shouldn't have the child.
[01:45:16.232 --> 01:45:20.575]  And I would first have my lawyer call them, knowing how criminal they are.
[01:45:20.595 --> 01:45:23.558]  Because if they hurt your kid, they'll try to blame you.
[01:45:24.574 --> 01:45:26.354]  If they kill your kid, they'll try to blame you.
[01:45:26.954 --> 01:45:30.855]  If they shoot them up and your kid dies in the hospital, they'll try to blame you.
[01:45:31.995 --> 01:45:32.895]  This is what they do.
[01:45:33.436 --> 01:45:38.816]  Not everyone's a criminal that works the hospital, but there's a reason authoritarian regimes always use hospital people.
[01:45:39.277 --> 01:45:52.879]  They'll follow orders, they have a disdain for the patients, in many cases, because they're sick of dealing with you all day, and they see humanity in bad shape, and we're just a decadent, satanic society.
[01:45:54.330 --> 01:45:57.513]  And yeah, the hospitals are there to kidnap your kids.
[01:45:57.553 --> 01:45:58.734]  They're there to prey on you.
[01:45:59.475 --> 01:46:03.740]  And when you go in to have a baby, they ask your wife, you know, are you doing okay with money?
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:05.141]  Is he nice to you?
[01:46:05.862 --> 01:46:07.423]  And they don't read you your rights there.
[01:46:07.444 --> 01:46:08.465]  They're about to take your kid.
[01:46:10.147 --> 01:46:12.868]  Especially if you're a good-looking, blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman.
[01:46:13.048 --> 01:46:16.708]  Or if you've got black hair and green eyes, your kids are gone no matter what happens.
[01:46:16.968 --> 01:46:19.009]  They've got like a half-million dollar bounty on those kids.
[01:46:20.389 --> 01:46:23.670]  And they're there feeding on the kids, just like all authoritarian regimes have done.
[01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.850]  They want the children.
[01:46:25.570 --> 01:46:30.111]  And now it's a national news story that, you know, they almost killed these people's kid.
[01:46:30.471 --> 01:46:32.472]  They had him on antibiotics when the child had the flu.
[01:46:32.932 --> 01:46:34.432]  There was one mistake after another.
[01:46:37.503 --> 01:46:39.044]  Who's the actor from Enemy Mind?
[01:46:40.545 --> 01:46:41.345]  He was in The Right Stuff.
[01:46:41.365 --> 01:46:42.206]  What's that actor's name?
[01:46:44.768 --> 01:46:46.209]  He's actually friends with one of my friends.
[01:46:47.169 --> 01:46:48.050]  Yeah, Dennis Quaid.
[01:46:48.370 --> 01:46:49.551]  They almost killed his kids!
[01:46:50.631 --> 01:46:53.493]  But see, if he wasn't a celebrity, they would have taken his kids.
[01:46:54.454 --> 01:46:54.974]  You understand?
[01:46:55.014 --> 01:46:55.735]  That's what they do.
[01:46:56.875 --> 01:46:59.077]  And the most dangerous thing in America is a hospital.
[01:46:59.855 --> 01:47:00.416]  Yeah, and I am.
[01:47:00.476 --> 01:47:02.800]  I mean, I am nasty about this.
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:04.683]  Things are out of balance with these people.
[01:47:05.384 --> 01:47:07.127]  So I don't know what I would do.
[01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:08.229]  You know, quite frankly,
[01:47:14.923 --> 01:47:17.546]  Quite frankly, it would depend on the situation.
[01:47:18.106 --> 01:47:28.417]  But obviously, it's like baiting someone or daring a five-year-old to go jump off a bridge to say, or, you know, I dare you to do this, I dare you to stick that in a light socket.
[01:47:28.617 --> 01:47:30.459]  You know, what are you going to do if the cops come and take your kids?
[01:47:30.879 --> 01:47:34.880]  I mean, I don't think anybody should say what they're planning to do, if they were planning something.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:37.441]  I always get these emails, why don't you call for a revolution?
[01:47:37.781 --> 01:47:49.923]  Of course, you know it's usually a provocateur or a fed, but sometimes it's real people, and of course they're the ones that want you to go out and cause some violence, so they can like stir up a fight at a high school, to like see two guys beat the hell out of each other.
[01:47:50.603 --> 01:47:51.704]  But I would probably...
[01:47:53.024 --> 01:47:53.825]  Not resist it.
[01:47:54.945 --> 01:48:05.672]  And that I would destroy everyone's lives, suing them over and over again, going after everyone, following people when they go to bars, showing them picking up hookers.
[01:48:06.152 --> 01:48:08.394]  I mean, I would ruin everyone's life involved.
[01:48:08.814 --> 01:48:09.935]  And they all know that.
[01:48:10.075 --> 01:48:14.037]  I would absolutely destroy everyone politically.
[01:48:14.318 --> 01:48:15.919]  But see, I have a little bit of political power.
[01:48:16.419 --> 01:48:20.922]  But even before, back when I was just a little local talk show host, I learned how to go after bad guys.
[01:48:22.303 --> 01:48:23.865]  So, I would get my kids back.
[01:48:26.507 --> 01:48:28.650]  But see, the state likes it to be out in the open.
[01:48:28.670 --> 01:48:35.337]  They're taking innocent families' kids and keeping them, no matter how much evidence there is, because it just trains everybody to accept it.
[01:48:35.577 --> 01:48:39.902]  How many times have you seen parents that show their boys or girls hugging each other?
[01:48:39.922 --> 01:48:43.206]  You know, one's in a towel, the other's in the towel, and they just hug each other.
[01:48:43.746 --> 01:48:45.967]  And then they call it pedophilia and take their kids.
[01:48:46.247 --> 01:48:51.729]  But the UN can be running giant child kidnapping rings worldwide in the news and no one gets in trouble.
[01:48:52.029 --> 01:48:55.110]  The truth is they're the perverts, they're the scum, they want your kids.
[01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:56.770]  They have an appetite for your kids.
[01:48:56.990 --> 01:49:01.552]  They'll be right next to a social worker that actually means well, that's such a bleeding heart airhead.
[01:49:02.688 --> 01:49:04.449]  That they just go along with it.
[01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:08.271]  There's a reason CPS has a 50-plus percent turnover rate per year.
[01:49:08.291 --> 01:49:14.274]  Because all these people go get degrees, generally because they were abused, and they really want to go, quote, help people.
[01:49:15.375 --> 01:49:18.036]  And then they find out, oh my God, this is really a pervert guild.
[01:49:18.056 --> 01:49:19.337]  This is really a pedophile guild.
[01:49:19.717 --> 01:49:21.598]  This is really, or a mercenary guild.
[01:49:21.618 --> 01:49:23.399]  A lot of it is just buying and selling the kids.
[01:49:23.999 --> 01:49:28.362]  Or they can get $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 per child through the adoption rackets.
[01:49:28.722 --> 01:49:33.665]  See, because of abortion, there are more people wanting to adopt each year than there are kids they can even get.
[01:49:34.706 --> 01:49:40.229]  And so that's why people get kids from South Korea, kids from China, kids from, you know, Africa, kids from Latin America.
[01:49:40.549 --> 01:49:42.851]  But in a lot of those cases, the kids are kidnapped too.
[01:49:44.594 --> 01:49:47.478]  But let me tell you, these rich families, they will pay $200,000, $300,000, $400,000.
[01:49:48.079 --> 01:49:52.705]  They'll want to see photos.
[01:49:52.745 --> 01:49:59.414]  The cops, a lot of times, will actually take photos of the parents that are provided to the adoption agent.
[01:49:59.754 --> 01:50:06.102]  I mean, if you've got a bombshell looking wife, I don't care if you're young professionals.
[01:50:06.522 --> 01:50:08.785]  If you're a good looking couple, you look like Clark Kent.
[01:50:09.386 --> 01:50:10.407]  I've talked to people involved.
[01:50:10.447 --> 01:50:13.311]  I mean, black hair, blue green eyes, it's over.
[01:50:13.931 --> 01:50:14.732]  That's the rarest.
[01:50:14.872 --> 01:50:18.256]  You walk into one of those hospitals, they are hunting your butt.
[01:50:18.777 --> 01:50:27.340]  I remember my dad saying, because he worked in rewiring jaws and stuff at major Dallas hospitals, when I was going to get, when I was like 15, getting my driver's license, going to take the driver's course.
[01:50:27.801 --> 01:50:29.521]  He goes, do not sign the organ donor card.
[01:50:30.602 --> 01:50:31.222]  And I said, why?
[01:50:31.242 --> 01:50:34.023]  And he goes, well, some hospitals won't give you care if you've signed it.
[01:50:34.363 --> 01:50:35.083]  They'll let you die.
[01:50:36.124 --> 01:50:37.844]  And I said, well, I didn't believe him.
[01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:40.245]  And he said, I've been told it goes on in Dallas.
[01:50:40.806 --> 01:50:42.786]  Sixty minutes, years later, I didn't believe him.
[01:50:43.607 --> 01:50:44.627]  But I still didn't sign it.
[01:50:45.067 --> 01:50:46.608]  Sixty minutes reported.
[01:50:47.938 --> 01:50:52.484]  That Dallas and Chicago were the two things they covered.
[01:50:52.504 --> 01:50:53.405]  You can look this up.
[01:50:53.705 --> 01:50:55.307]  We're killing people for their organs.
[01:50:58.992 --> 01:50:59.653]  I love it!
[01:50:59.693 --> 01:51:01.435]  The government loves you!
[01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:06.782]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[01:51:08.177 --> 01:51:13.358]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[01:51:31.207 --> 01:51:32.288]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:51:32.468 --> 01:51:36.851]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:37.031 --> 01:51:42.735]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:51:42.835 --> 01:51:46.237]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:51:46.477 --> 01:51:49.079]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:49.299 --> 01:51:54.102]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:52:01.427 --> 01:52:03.328]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:52:03.368 --> 01:52:05.308]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:52:05.508 --> 01:52:10.990]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:14.951]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:52:15.211 --> 01:52:18.932]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:52:19.092 --> 01:52:20.292]  The fact is, you are.
[01:52:20.492 --> 01:52:21.272]  We all are.
[01:52:21.492 --> 01:52:23.833]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[01:54:17.836 --> 01:54:27.387]  You know, I've got this reporter here, and I was saying, search engine, tasering people to make them ask questions, and he goes, well, I found the case in Niagara.
[01:54:27.928 --> 01:54:32.273]  The judge said police can taser you to make you, you know, open your mouth, give them a DNA sample.
[01:54:32.673 --> 01:54:36.778]  And then I found one out of Florida where they tasered a guy on a gurney to make him pee in a cup.
[01:54:37.699 --> 01:54:39.400]  And he goes, well, those are just small towns.
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:41.162]  Yeah, this is Orlando, Florida, where this happened.
[01:54:41.842 --> 01:54:44.704]  No, it's federally trained pain compliance.
[01:54:44.784 --> 01:54:47.126]  I've had former police chief, Sean, I've talked about it.
[01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:57.834]  The feds, this is going on all over the world, it's global standardization, are training that if someone doesn't answer their questions, Taser, if someone doesn't follow every order, well, what about the Fifth Amendment?
[01:54:58.155 --> 01:55:06.341]  I mean, what about, what about the, I saw people commenting on the YouTube video from the show last week where I talked about how we got the business, um,
[01:55:08.027 --> 01:55:08.447]  Census.
[01:55:09.828 --> 01:55:11.349]  That was going to be every 10 years.
[01:55:11.409 --> 01:55:12.469]  Now it's going to be every year.
[01:55:12.529 --> 01:55:14.470]  They're talking about some businesses every month.
[01:55:14.991 --> 01:55:17.192]  And people are like, I didn't get this census.
[01:55:17.252 --> 01:55:18.072]  It isn't real.
[01:55:18.453 --> 01:55:20.434]  Well, you don't run a business, dummy.
[01:55:21.894 --> 01:55:31.880]  It's like how people will do backflips, mental gymnastics to not look at what's going on and to always say that's an isolated incident.
[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:34.001]  No, it's not an isolated incident.
[01:55:36.118 --> 01:55:39.803]  We had police in Austin a couple months ago say we couldn't hand out our magazine.
[01:55:41.224 --> 01:55:44.989]  And then they said, by the way, you can't have InfoWars on your car parked at a parking meter.
[01:55:45.289 --> 01:55:49.314]  We say that's a violation of the advertising zoning ordinance.
[01:55:50.185 --> 01:55:53.526]  And then I got on the phone with him because I wasn't down there, and I said, are you joking?
[01:55:53.546 --> 01:55:54.626]  And he goes, look, I'm a listener.
[01:55:55.007 --> 01:55:55.847]  I don't like doing this.
[01:55:55.907 --> 01:55:57.067]  I've been ordered to do this by the city.
[01:55:57.427 --> 01:55:58.668]  I said, you get your boss down there.
[01:55:58.888 --> 01:56:01.889]  So then the deputy head of zoning enforcement comes down.
[01:56:01.909 --> 01:56:03.909]  And I said, fine, I'm going to sue you all.
[01:56:03.949 --> 01:56:04.430]  I'm coming.
[01:56:04.630 --> 01:56:05.550]  And then they backed off.
[01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:11.172]  But the point is, I can't have a bumper sticker until I threaten to sue you lunatics!
[01:56:12.335 --> 01:56:18.440]  The cops should have said, no way I'm gonna write them tickets for bumper stickers on their frickin' car, excuse me.
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.761]  Excuse me, man, I'm sick of this!
[01:56:21.182 --> 01:56:23.804]  And I'm sick of sitting here trying to get this country out of a coma!
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:30.301]  And it really made me even sicker when I got down there and the cops were all, hey man, we'll take photos with you.
[01:56:30.562 --> 01:56:31.342]  We're all listeners.
[01:56:31.362 --> 01:56:32.162]  We're all nice guys.
[01:56:32.462 --> 01:56:33.423]  We didn't like doing it.
[01:56:34.383 --> 01:56:34.923]  Exactly.
[01:56:35.223 --> 01:56:36.824]  Why did you follow the order?
[01:56:37.164 --> 01:56:39.305]  Why did you write the tickets to our street team?
[01:56:39.425 --> 01:56:39.885]  Why?
[01:56:40.225 --> 01:56:40.685]  Why?
[01:56:40.965 --> 01:56:41.465]  Why?
[01:56:42.466 --> 01:56:44.867]  Why do all these good people go along with this?
[01:56:44.947 --> 01:56:45.767]  I'm sick of it!
[01:56:48.328 --> 01:56:51.049]  It's like Arte Cerveda, the police chief, was in my office a few weeks ago.
[01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:51.429]  He's on air.
[01:56:52.782 --> 01:57:00.145]  And I'm sitting there talking to him, and I go, look, I know you guys can dial in in the Threat Fusion Center thing and find my cell phone wherever I'm at without a warrant.
[01:57:01.166 --> 01:57:07.108]  And him and the deputy cop, you know, his assistant, he brought with him, smiled through the window, and already stated, he goes, well, so what?
[01:57:07.249 --> 01:57:08.589]  What do you have to hide?
[01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:11.250]  What do I have to hide, buddy?
[01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:13.551]  Why do you have walls up around your house?
[01:57:14.612 --> 01:57:16.693]  It's not because you have something to hide, but you know what?
[01:57:16.793 --> 01:57:19.054]  You might want to go get on the toilet in privacy.
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:21.921]  You might want to argue with your wife in privacy.
[01:57:21.941 --> 01:57:23.502]  You might want some privacy, buddy.
[01:57:23.903 --> 01:57:26.625]  It's my privacy, and I'm not guilty because I want it.
[01:57:26.825 --> 01:57:27.505]  You freak!
[01:57:28.666 --> 01:57:31.508]  Government is making everything more and more secretive.
[01:57:31.848 --> 01:57:32.649]  Arm into the teeth.
[01:57:32.949 --> 01:57:34.850]  Giant underground bunkers full of food.
[01:57:35.230 --> 01:57:36.912]  And we go, hey, we better get prepared.
[01:57:36.972 --> 01:57:37.772]  Something's going on.
[01:57:37.832 --> 01:57:38.553]  Oh, that's crazy!
[01:57:40.009 --> 01:57:43.793]  But then the government lies and says they don't have COG plans for the public.
[01:57:44.114 --> 01:57:48.338]  The government lies and says, we're not planning anything, there's nothing going on here.
[01:57:48.558 --> 01:57:50.000]  Which makes it even more creepy.
[01:57:50.481 --> 01:57:54.105]  Talking to this Esquire guy and he goes, well of course, we're a big country, they've got to do that.
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:58:00.723]  And yeah, they've got to have basic plans of a tidal wave hit the West Coast or a meteor hit something.
[01:58:01.583 --> 01:58:02.764]  But they're not even doing that.
[01:58:03.424 --> 01:58:10.628]  They have zombie drills all over the country where they practice with heavy machine guns mowing down masses of Americans.
[01:58:11.088 --> 01:58:15.290]  And they used to do it without calling them zombies, but the Marines are like, we're trained to kill Americans.
[01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:18.272]  So they went, oh, it's a zombie drill.
[01:58:19.072 --> 01:58:22.154]  It's a zombie drill to dehumanize us.
[01:58:23.877 --> 01:58:26.920]  Like the Nazis said, we're not killing Jews, we're killing rats.
[01:58:27.861 --> 01:58:29.362]  And what did the LA Times depict me as?
[01:58:29.623 --> 01:58:30.243]  A rat.
[01:58:31.324 --> 01:58:33.987]  I'm a rat, saying the government might have been involved in the bombing.
[01:58:34.267 --> 01:58:36.710]  No, they just have a long history of it, but I'm not supposed to question it.
[01:58:37.050 --> 01:58:40.013]  More of your phone calls coming up, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:00:32.516 --> 02:00:35.479]  I'm going to take 50 phone calls in the next hour.
[02:00:35.499 --> 02:00:36.900]  50 phone calls.
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:38.641]  Full free number to join us.
[02:00:38.661 --> 02:00:39.322]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:39.342 --> 02:00:39.382]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:39.602 --> 02:00:48.629]  I'm kind of doing the voice of Jack Van Impey's announcer.
[02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:51.471]  Jack Van Impey and Rexella Van Impey.
[02:00:52.012 --> 02:00:52.772]  Revelation.
[02:00:52.792 --> 02:00:56.995]  It's always a fun show to watch, just to imitate that guy's voice.
[02:00:57.035 --> 02:00:57.536]  He's awesome.
[02:00:59.938 --> 02:01:02.561]  Who's the announcer's name on the Van Empyre Show?
[02:01:04.043 --> 02:01:07.207]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lornen in Texas.
[02:01:07.767 --> 02:01:08.989]  You're on the air, Lornen.
[02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:10.290]  Come on down!
[02:01:11.482 --> 02:01:14.563]  Hey Alex, how about, how about this?
[02:01:14.583 --> 02:01:17.784]  I'm listening to the radio show, it's awesome, you're on fire today.
[02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:29.107]  How about all the Info Warriors, right now, like around the walls of Jericho, we give the loudest battle cry that the pinko commies have ever heard!
[02:01:29.787 --> 02:01:32.268]  Yeah!
[02:01:32.348 --> 02:01:35.609]  Yeah!
[02:01:35.809 --> 02:01:39.230]  I'm not gonna yell that loud, I don't have much voice left, but you're right.
[02:01:39.997 --> 02:01:40.818]  Yeah!
[02:01:41.238 --> 02:01:41.478]  Yeah!
[02:01:41.578 --> 02:01:43.400]  Yabba-dabba-doo!
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:43.500]  Yeah!
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:48.104]  The anticipation's been killing me!
[02:01:48.124 --> 02:01:49.205]  Shake it off, man.
[02:01:49.225 --> 02:01:50.386]  Shake off the mind control.
[02:01:51.307 --> 02:01:53.369]  All because of running around with your tongue hanging out.
[02:01:55.137 --> 02:02:00.261]  The last time I called was when Lou Rockwell was on and I was laid up on the couch with pain pills.
[02:02:00.321 --> 02:02:05.865]  I was out of my mind and I was telling him, I'm ready to tear my house down because of the way they're treating Ron Paul!
[02:02:06.626 --> 02:02:08.567]  And I wanted to, you know, I never did get to my point.
[02:02:08.587 --> 02:02:14.031]  I wanted to call him out and ask him why he never did clear the air about the so-called quote-unquote racist newsletters.
[02:02:14.091 --> 02:02:15.272]  But you know, that's for another day.
[02:02:15.757 --> 02:02:18.400]  I actually wrote my points down and I want to go down it.
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.362]  This is the call for the course of action.
[02:02:20.602 --> 02:02:22.444]  I think maybe you needed to hear from me.
[02:02:22.504 --> 02:02:23.745]  My car didn't start today.
[02:02:23.805 --> 02:02:26.047]  I gotta, you know, change a starter out after we're done.
[02:02:26.628 --> 02:02:30.351]  But, you know, I'm glad I'm here at home and I can have a battle cry with my brother in arms.
[02:02:31.653 --> 02:02:32.914]  First, are you still there?
[02:02:33.594 --> 02:02:33.975]  Yes, I am.
[02:02:33.995 --> 02:02:35.296]  I'm going to move quick through calls.
[02:02:35.336 --> 02:02:35.877]  I love your call.
[02:02:35.897 --> 02:02:36.057]  Go ahead.
[02:02:36.077 --> 02:02:37.018]  I just want to get to everybody else.
[02:02:37.756 --> 02:02:38.056]  There we go.
[02:02:38.076 --> 02:02:38.897]  I'm going to go down the list.
[02:02:39.257 --> 02:02:40.698]  First off, this is a common alliance.
[02:02:40.738 --> 02:02:41.879]  This isn't a leader-follower.
[02:02:41.919 --> 02:02:42.780]  You're not my leader.
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:44.401]  You didn't make me the way I am.
[02:02:44.561 --> 02:02:47.764]  I am the way I am, and I saw a brother in arms who saw the world as it is.
[02:02:48.324 --> 02:02:52.347]  We're not really, you know, addressing problems to identify the enemy.
[02:02:52.407 --> 02:02:53.168]  We know the enemy.
[02:02:53.248 --> 02:02:53.949]  It's a potato.
[02:02:54.389 --> 02:02:57.351]  Every time I read the news, I'm saying, oh, well, a potato's got eyes.
[02:02:57.411 --> 02:02:58.612]  A potato's a root family.
[02:02:58.632 --> 02:02:59.493]  It grows in the dirt.
[02:02:59.513 --> 02:03:00.353]  You know it's brown.
[02:03:00.434 --> 02:03:02.535]  It tastes good when you put salt and pepper and butter on it.
[02:03:02.855 --> 02:03:03.596]  It's a potato.
[02:03:03.756 --> 02:03:04.797]  So we know it's a potato.
[02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:06.638]  So what are we going to do with the potato?
[02:03:06.738 --> 02:03:09.260]  All right, first off, InfoWarrior street team.
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:17.307]  I think it would be a good idea to maybe have a press pack with like five or ten t-shirts, pads, bumper stickers, all the kind of good stuff that you want to go do person to person.
[02:03:17.707 --> 02:03:21.510]  Camp out in front of Walmart, camp out in front of the mall, hand out the information.
[02:03:21.810 --> 02:03:29.677]  Let's get a hundred thousand street teams all across the country handing out t-shirts, bumper stickers, brochures, flyers, shaking hands, meeting babies, whatever.
[02:03:30.637 --> 02:03:31.638]  All right, second off,
[02:03:33.692 --> 02:03:35.758]  I think something that we maybe might work.
[02:03:37.330 --> 02:03:41.572]  I don't really know of any law that prevents somebody from burning their social security card.
[02:03:41.612 --> 02:03:49.457]  So how about we get, you know, a million people, three million people in front of the Federal Reserve and we don't burn our social security card and we secede from, you know, the IRS taxes.
[02:03:49.537 --> 02:03:50.197]  That's right.
[02:03:51.138 --> 02:03:51.538]  Exactly.
[02:03:51.578 --> 02:03:55.620]  This is one argument that no establishment can have, even if they claim they're altruistic.
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:04.906]  The private Federal Reserve in the 17th Amendment, turning our senators into federal minions, the income tax created the same year, paid to the private Federal Reserve, is a foreign, alien,
[02:04:05.686 --> 02:04:05.966]  I think?
[02:04:34.230 --> 02:04:40.235]  Suing Citi over $60,000 fine for gun lighters.
[02:04:42.377 --> 02:04:42.637]  U.S.
[02:04:42.677 --> 02:04:52.646]  Camera and Computer says the city's Department of Consumer Affairs was arbitrary and capricious when it fined the shop in 2011 for carrying a small weapon like lighters.
[02:04:52.706 --> 02:04:54.207]  Folks, they want your guns.
[02:04:54.708 --> 02:04:58.731]  They've banned BB guns in many cities, and they've banned things that look like guns.
[02:04:59.092 --> 02:04:59.992]  That's thought crime.
[02:05:00.012 --> 02:05:01.093]  They're arresting kids.
[02:05:02.034 --> 02:05:03.055]  I had tried everything.
[02:05:03.115 --> 02:05:08.158]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:05:08.598 --> 02:05:13.081]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:05:13.421 --> 02:05:19.805]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:05:20.285 --> 02:05:30.771]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:31.491 --> 02:05:35.633]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:05:35.973 --> 02:05:38.975]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[02:05:39.335 --> 02:05:41.997]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:42.217 --> 02:05:43.378]  Now that's results.
[02:05:43.798 --> 02:05:50.223]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[02:05:50.584 --> 02:05:55.907]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[02:06:02.452 --> 02:06:08.297]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:06:09.187 --> 02:06:15.090]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[02:06:15.931 --> 02:06:26.016]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver Solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver Nasal Applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[02:06:26.896 --> 02:06:30.198]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:06:31.038 --> 02:06:37.222]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:06:37.962 --> 02:06:48.394]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.
[02:06:49.215 --> 02:06:56.804]  Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver based products are best for you.

[02:07:01.452 --> 02:07:03.354]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:07:03.394 --> 02:07:05.315]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:07:05.555 --> 02:07:11.059]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:07:11.279 --> 02:07:15.061]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:07:15.321 --> 02:07:19.084]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:07:19.244 --> 02:07:20.445]  The fact is, you are.
[02:07:20.645 --> 02:07:21.425]  We all are.
[02:07:21.665 --> 02:07:23.987]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:07:24.287 --> 02:07:32.655]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:32.855 --> 02:07:34.076]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:07:34.236 --> 02:07:37.419]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:07:37.719 --> 02:07:39.981]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:07:40.101 --> 02:07:44.525]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:44.666 --> 02:07:50.571]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:50.771 --> 02:07:51.291]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:07:51.331 --> 02:07:52.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:23.258 --> 02:08:24.518]  Monday through Friday.
[02:08:25.819 --> 02:08:26.600]  We're here 11 a.m.
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:27.180]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:30.562]  back weeknight 7 o'clock in Fort Worth's Nightly News back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:08:30.582 --> 02:08:31.642]  with the Sunday Transmission.
[02:08:32.383 --> 02:08:42.969]  Well, the Palm Beach Post is reporting the sheriff wants people to call us if the guy down the street hates the government and talks bad about the government.
[02:08:43.009 --> 02:08:48.152]  We're gonna go knock on their door because there's such an epidemic of people attacking the government.
[02:08:48.891 --> 02:08:53.417]  No, it's the government, nine times out of ten, attacking us and saying we need to turn our guns in.
[02:08:54.118 --> 02:08:59.245]  In New York now, if you have a toy lighter, they fine you $60,000 if it looks like a gun.
[02:08:59.285 --> 02:09:03.290]  So the image of the gun, there's no lobby for the image of the gun, so they ban that.
[02:09:04.181 --> 02:09:07.084]  And Obama is to lobby for immigration reform, i.e.
[02:09:07.124 --> 02:09:17.473]  North American Union open borders, and the voting bloc will be put on welfare and then vote to take our guns, like they've done in Mexico to have the highest crime rate in the world, 60,000 dead in the last six years.
[02:09:18.194 --> 02:09:21.637]  A president to pitch immigration overhaul in Mexico.
[02:09:22.728 --> 02:09:24.829]  Isn't that just cute?
[02:09:25.529 --> 02:09:31.470]  And I've got several articles here I'm going to get to after I take a bunch of calls, where you've got so-called leftists, and they're not leftists.
[02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:33.591]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[02:09:34.911 --> 02:09:42.173]  These people are authoritarians posing as liberals, just like a lot of neocons pose as conservatives or constitutionalists, and are really flaming authoritarians.
[02:09:42.934 --> 02:09:51.476]  All over the country, I've got a CNN article, and I've got another one here, it's actually on my phone, I didn't punch it up on the computer yet.
[02:09:52.785 --> 02:09:59.449]  Where the police say, and the people have confessed, to staging attacks on themselves.
[02:09:59.589 --> 02:10:01.750]  Women saying Republicans threatened to rape them.
[02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:04.352]  And then it turns out the posts were posted by them.
[02:10:04.372 --> 02:10:10.255]  You know, the lesbian that said that she was attacked and the men came in and raped her and scraped stuff on her.
[02:10:10.575 --> 02:10:18.920]  You had a bunch of women caught scraping the word Obama on their faces and stuff and then blaming it on Obama.
[02:10:20.038 --> 02:10:23.319]  You've had the people do it to themselves and then blame it on Obama supporters.
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:29.141]  And then also do it and say that, you know, vice versa.
[02:10:29.562 --> 02:10:34.103]  You've had Obama people say they were attacked by racists because of Obama and it was staged.
[02:10:34.703 --> 02:10:37.484]  The public engages in false flags constantly.
[02:10:39.925 --> 02:10:40.585]  Constantly.
[02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:42.766]  It's going on and on and on.
[02:10:43.346 --> 02:10:44.027]  Yeah, here it is.
[02:10:47.421 --> 02:10:53.524]  I'm going to go over a few of these articles here after we go to some of your phone calls.
[02:10:53.584 --> 02:11:07.250]  But absolute creepville taking place all over the United States as the public just has no connection to the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:11:07.951 --> 02:11:09.912]  And so why not just be completely overrun?
[02:11:10.132 --> 02:11:10.712]  Here's another one.
[02:11:10.972 --> 02:11:14.634]  Suicide rates skyrockets among middle-aged Americans.
[02:11:17.458 --> 02:11:26.121]  And that is a article out of Breitbart, and they ask, why is it skyrocketing so much?
[02:11:27.641 --> 02:11:29.041]  And again, I'll get to that if we take calls.
[02:11:29.862 --> 02:11:32.302]  Well, I mean, gee, why are the troops committing suicide mass?
[02:11:32.342 --> 02:11:36.164]  I see these articles going, top psychiatrists don't know why.
[02:11:36.524 --> 02:11:37.624]  They have no idea.
[02:11:37.824 --> 02:11:38.724]  From the Pentagon.
[02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:43.486]  Gee, the Pentagon's not going to tell on itself making people serve five, six, seven, eight tours.
[02:11:44.306 --> 02:11:49.787]  That Sergeant Bales that went and reportedly killed 18 people in some type of delusional rage.
[02:11:50.087 --> 02:11:54.268]  He was under psychiatric care, reportedly on psychotropic drugs, but they won't say which ones.
[02:11:54.508 --> 02:11:56.029]  He had part of his foot blown off.
[02:11:56.269 --> 02:11:57.869]  He was being sent back for a fourth tour.
[02:11:58.089 --> 02:12:03.391]  He'd been arrested by police for going bonkers on his wife, reportedly, and out in the woods.
[02:12:03.511 --> 02:12:04.751]  That all got expunged.
[02:12:06.499 --> 02:12:12.983]  And then they sent him back and then he watched a IED blow up an armored vehicle and kill his buddy and watched his buddy bleed out.
[02:12:13.464 --> 02:12:23.070]  And then the next night he climbs over the wall and goes and slowly kills and burns 18 people, including children, at multiple houses in a sleepwalking rage.
[02:12:25.214 --> 02:12:30.138]  Yeah, you put somebody, I mean folks, they put prosthesis on these guys now and they'll get back out there.
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:33.381]  You wonder why they're committing suicide?
[02:12:33.421 --> 02:12:37.545]  Last numbers I saw, seven times in any previous record from the end of the Vietnam War in 74.
[02:12:37.585 --> 02:12:39.747]  Now you wonder why Americans are?
[02:12:40.007 --> 02:12:42.249]  Because this is a screwed up society, that's why.
[02:12:42.770 --> 02:12:46.453]  Filled with preservatives and GMO and a toxic culture of death.
[02:12:48.154 --> 02:12:50.597]  And I'm just railing and flailing around.
[02:12:50.617 --> 02:12:51.758]  I want out of it too.
[02:12:53.279 --> 02:12:55.480]  I'll tell you the story and then I'll go to your calls, I promise.
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.821]  I said I take a lot of calls, which I never can do, so.
[02:12:58.621 --> 02:12:59.422]  Because I'm out of control.
[02:12:59.482 --> 02:13:00.022]  I just do what I do.
[02:13:00.382 --> 02:13:05.744]  I went to the Mid-America Science Museum that has the biggest Tesla coil, reportedly, in the world.
[02:13:05.764 --> 02:13:06.444]  That's what they say.
[02:13:06.684 --> 02:13:07.545]  Biggest one I've ever seen.
[02:13:08.405 --> 02:13:09.325]  I've seen a couple of them.
[02:13:10.126 --> 02:13:17.048]  And I'm going to upload that video to YouTube, but my phone's not been logging into YouTube since I dropped it in the sink the other day.
[02:13:17.068 --> 02:13:18.489]  So we're going to try to get these videos up.
[02:13:19.009 --> 02:13:20.410]  Or when I get back tomorrow, we'll do it.
[02:13:21.772 --> 02:13:33.821]  The point is, is that they had this thing called, uh, our underground Arkansas, underground Arkansas.
[02:13:35.044 --> 02:13:43.248]  And I thought you'd go on there and be like crystals and little gnomes or something, you know, Alice in Wonderland, or it would show what like underground Arkansas is like as a miner.
[02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:46.730]  No, it's like a, it's like a CIA tortured box.
[02:13:46.770 --> 02:13:50.932]  They, you know, put people in, they torture, you know, they lock them up in a tube or a box.
[02:13:50.972 --> 02:13:51.673]  That's what it was.
[02:13:52.642 --> 02:13:56.884]  And my kids go in there and nobody, there wasn't a sign saying, don't put adults in this.
[02:13:57.465 --> 02:13:59.025]  So I, and I'm not claustrophobic.
[02:13:59.045 --> 02:14:07.990]  I mean, I've gone spelunking and you know, things I, I don't particularly, and I've done some cave diving, open cave diving, you know, gone back in like 50 feet and still conked my head and stuff.
[02:14:08.050 --> 02:14:09.371]  And I just don't particularly like it.
[02:14:09.411 --> 02:14:15.294]  But the point is, is that I go into this thing and I go all the way back into there.
[02:14:16.434 --> 02:14:25.801]  And it's one tube, barely, because I'm a big guy, I weigh 250 pounds, I got broad shoulders, and a good size, you know, belly when I'm at least sitting down.
[02:14:26.642 --> 02:14:30.185]  And I'm going through it, I'm like, man, okay, this has got to be the one tube.
[02:14:30.225 --> 02:14:34.548]  So there's another tube, and another tube, and another tube, and another tube, and another tube.
[02:14:34.568 --> 02:14:37.591]  And my kids are laughing and having fun because they're little, they can go through it.
[02:14:38.631 --> 02:14:43.816]  And then you go through, like, these nightmare things with, like, these ropes you're in, and
[02:14:46.328 --> 02:14:51.430]  When I got out of it, I was sweating and stuff, and I'd eat a big barbecue meal here.
[02:14:51.570 --> 02:14:52.570]  One of the best barbecues I ever had.
[02:14:52.590 --> 02:14:54.751]  I think it's called McLair's or McLairids or something.
[02:14:55.311 --> 02:14:56.471]  Bill Clinton's favorite barbecue place.
[02:14:56.511 --> 02:14:59.032]  I later learned it is world famous for on the cover of Playboy magazine.
[02:14:59.312 --> 02:15:00.073]  They had that hanging out.
[02:15:00.093 --> 02:15:01.833]  The place was like criminally good.
[02:15:02.093 --> 02:15:07.155]  Thank God I don't live in Hot Springs, Arkansas, folks, because I thought the best barbecue I have was in Memphis, and I love Texas barbecue.
[02:15:07.415 --> 02:15:09.616]  Don't get me wrong, but this was sinfully delicious.
[02:15:10.849 --> 02:15:11.910]  It's a real dive, too.
[02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:13.572]  It's made even better.
[02:15:14.773 --> 02:15:20.198]  So I've got that in my stomach, and I come out sweating, and I had this realization.
[02:15:20.238 --> 02:15:23.642]  I said, this is what I feel like with the New World Order.
[02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:27.332]  It's like claustrophobia lite.
[02:15:27.973 --> 02:15:43.730]  I mean, I was drawn to media and TV and radio because I didn't like them trying to demonize private property rights, demonize the family, demonize men, demonize the Second Amendment, because it upset me at a fundamental, free-spirited, rebellious, whatever you want to call it, level.
[02:15:46.144 --> 02:15:50.707]  And I realize the feeling I get right now is like being in those tubes.
[02:15:51.707 --> 02:15:53.288]  So people want to know what powers the show?
[02:15:53.808 --> 02:15:54.949]  That's what's powering it.
[02:15:55.269 --> 02:15:56.250]  That's why I'm angry.
[02:15:56.270 --> 02:16:00.092]  Because by the 10th tube, I was ready to get out of there.
[02:16:01.696 --> 02:16:04.877]  Imagine a big mess in almost total darkness.
[02:16:04.898 --> 02:16:08.739]  In fact, it was total darkness until you come out in these areas with a little bit of black light.
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:18.724]  I mean, can you imagine the people they lock up, like the North Vietnamese would do to our soldiers, in like cages for years, smaller than their bodies, and they would get off on it?
[02:16:20.168 --> 02:16:26.312]  All those, you know, Asian forms of torture, and then all the medieval European tortures, and then the tortures they do.
[02:16:26.812 --> 02:16:27.873]  It's because they like it, folks.
[02:16:27.893 --> 02:16:30.114]  You know who the CIA hired to run those torture camps?
[02:16:30.875 --> 02:16:35.218]  People, jail guards from around the world who'd been kicked out for raping people and torturing people.
[02:16:35.458 --> 02:16:37.279]  The truth is they torture because they like to do it.
[02:16:37.919 --> 02:16:40.281]  And they like to get fake confessions and they like the power of it.
[02:16:41.722 --> 02:16:42.382]  Look at our culture.
[02:16:42.402 --> 02:16:44.404]  It's obsessed with torture and stuff and darkness.
[02:16:45.624 --> 02:16:49.367]  And it just absolutely makes me want to throw up.
[02:16:50.322 --> 02:16:56.645]  And I'm telling you, being under the New World Order is like watching our whole society in tubes that get smaller and smaller.
[02:16:56.665 --> 02:17:03.187]  And there's all this propaganda of why it's good and why we're lucky and how it's a great thing and how we should appreciate it.
[02:17:03.387 --> 02:17:03.787]  No!
[02:17:04.668 --> 02:17:04.948]  No!
[02:17:04.968 --> 02:17:05.988]  I know it's bad.
[02:17:06.268 --> 02:17:07.249]  History shows it's bad.
[02:17:07.269 --> 02:17:10.630]  And our founders said the stuff that's going on is bad, bad, bad.
[02:17:11.451 --> 02:17:19.374]  And any amount of perfume can be put on this, but it's still... It's still... This whole New World Order is a dead, rotting pig in a box.
[02:17:20.202 --> 02:17:21.184]  I'm telling you, that's what it is.
[02:17:22.746 --> 02:17:31.880]  And I had this epiphany for the last couple of tubes, and I kind of relaxed, and I was like, this is... This is what I feel like talking about the New World Order.
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:34.985]  This feeling... It's disgusting!
[02:17:36.994 --> 02:17:37.194]  All right.
[02:17:37.314 --> 02:17:38.495]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[02:17:38.535 --> 02:17:39.656]  I'm trying to punch up the phone system.
[02:17:39.836 --> 02:17:41.757]  We're going to skip this network break.
[02:17:41.777 --> 02:17:42.838]  I'm going to skip this break.
[02:17:42.858 --> 02:17:48.242]  As I said, I take nothing but calls and I've got to follow that promise by skipping breaks if I have to.
[02:17:48.262 --> 02:17:50.343]  It's like Salon says, all I want is money.
[02:17:51.484 --> 02:17:52.144]  Actually, it's kind of true.
[02:17:52.164 --> 02:17:54.066]  I do want money to destroy the New World Order.
[02:17:54.486 --> 02:17:56.907]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Illinois.
[02:17:56.948 --> 02:17:57.568]  You're on the air.
[02:17:57.608 --> 02:17:58.048]  Go ahead.
[02:17:58.068 --> 02:17:59.950]  Hi, Alex.
[02:18:00.010 --> 02:18:03.432]  Happy Police Adoration Day from Springfield, Illinois.
[02:18:04.601 --> 02:18:08.904]  The cops are honoring themselves today with formations and parades.
[02:18:09.584 --> 02:18:15.728]  And I just want to say that I totally respect the dead, but I respect all dead.
[02:18:15.988 --> 02:18:19.750]  You know, coal miners, in my opinion, are heroic people.
[02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:22.371]  Oh my God, I really respect coal miners now.
[02:18:23.792 --> 02:18:24.953]  It's funny you mention that, yeah.
[02:18:25.996 --> 02:18:27.857]  That's a dangerous profession, yeah.
[02:18:28.017 --> 02:18:32.658]  After they're told that you're going to die if you go down there to save your buddy, they go anyway.
[02:18:33.158 --> 02:18:48.242]  So, and here's what, I want to compliment you, I know you hate compliments, but the two things that keep me listening and keep me interested, aside from the information, which the seeking of truth is this, two things.
[02:18:48.582 --> 02:18:50.923]  Your work ethic is second to none.
[02:18:51.656 --> 02:18:56.058]  Okay, I was listening to you when you used to go eight hours a day on air.
[02:18:56.698 --> 02:19:00.279]  The second thing is you never use profanity on air.
[02:19:00.759 --> 02:19:02.620]  And that is very commendable.
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:04.060]  It's worth complimenting.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:06.361]  I hope people appreciate how hard it is.
[02:19:06.881 --> 02:19:12.145]  To sit and rant and rant and rant and never say Hades instead of hell.
[02:19:12.685 --> 02:19:13.045]  Okay?
[02:19:13.606 --> 02:19:29.736]  I mean... Well, I know we have children listening, but exactly, but sometimes stuff is so bad, you know, you've got to, like when the police are saying, burn that effer down, and then said they didn't mean that, with Dorner, you have to quote them without, you know, you have to say the effing, because it's the police that said it on the scanner.
[02:19:29.996 --> 02:19:32.098]  But yes, I do try to keep the show as clean as possible.
[02:19:33.035 --> 02:19:46.704]  That's just a statement to what I would call your intelligent pursuit of a scholarly type environment.
[02:19:49.284 --> 02:19:56.071]  People who have no other, you know, words to use, cuss, and swear, like Joe Rogan.
[02:19:56.151 --> 02:19:57.612]  I mean, I'm not putting him down.
[02:19:57.632 --> 02:20:01.296]  And especially the guy that criticized Dondi.
[02:20:01.776 --> 02:20:09.023]  You know, that guy couldn't make a, he talked about how high his IQ was and he couldn't even complete a sentence without cussing.
[02:20:09.063 --> 02:20:12.226]  Yeah, that video, that video that's up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:20:12.867 --> 02:20:16.529]  I think of the headlines, MSNBC gas discredits themselves.
[02:20:17.169 --> 02:20:21.211]  It should be, you know, globalist minion destroyed by history.
[02:20:21.231 --> 02:20:23.852]  I mean, history is kryptonite to that guy.
[02:20:24.232 --> 02:20:29.054]  And you notice in the interview he did with Dew, and he's like the darling of MSNBC and stuff like that, that's going to hurt us.
[02:20:29.094 --> 02:20:31.155]  Like, go out and confront him full force, shut them up.
[02:20:31.636 --> 02:20:38.219]  The guy is sitting there going, and Alex says there was nobody killed at Sandy Hook, and nobody killed in the Boston bombing, you're a liar!
[02:20:38.499 --> 02:20:40.620]  And Rob Dew goes, we didn't say that, we said there was a drill.
[02:20:41.365 --> 02:20:52.074]  And we said that they'd probably have connections to the FBI and CIA, which they did, and now they're having him confess with no proof while he's sedated in a hospital bed.
[02:20:52.094 --> 02:20:53.295]  You're not supposed to do that.
[02:20:53.736 --> 02:20:58.720]  That clearly, because that means they could set people up, and the government has a history of framing and setting people up.
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:01.903]  Shut up, you FNFO boys, you scum!
[02:21:01.923 --> 02:21:05.906]  I got a high IQ and the government ain't doing nothing wrong.
[02:21:06.787 --> 02:21:08.547]  And by the way, folks, I love northern voices.
[02:21:08.587 --> 02:21:10.828]  I'm not making fun of Yankees.
[02:21:10.848 --> 02:21:12.168]  I like to do redneck voices, too.
[02:21:12.228 --> 02:21:16.029]  In fact, I think I've been reincarnated from Elmer Fudd.
[02:21:16.049 --> 02:21:18.330]  I would actually like to speak like that all the time.
[02:21:18.990 --> 02:21:20.170]  Joe, I appreciate your call.
[02:21:20.470 --> 02:21:22.511]  It's good to hear from you, Jess.
[02:21:23.071 --> 02:21:29.813]  Let's go to Rod in Oregon calling about the dumb and dumb of America, which is the conspiracy theory.
[02:21:30.173 --> 02:21:31.113]  Go ahead, Rod.
[02:21:32.130 --> 02:21:53.525]  Hey Alex, God bless you brother, and I pray every day for you, your family, all your staff and their families and everybody that's dealing with this, exposing the crap that's going on, excuse the language, but anyway, I had a comment to make and I had a question to ask you too, but because of your show that's been going on, there's a couple other things that came to my attention and I wanted to make a comment.
[02:21:53.825 --> 02:21:57.948]  Why is it that all, everybody can keep preferring this government
[02:21:58.428 --> 02:21:59.129]  I don't think so.
[02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:22.431]  Uh, you know, USA, USA!
[02:22:22.892 --> 02:22:40.504]  And it's like, no matter how stupid people are, even with these petitions that have been, these mock petitions that have been going out, it's incredible, uh, banning pressure cookers now, uh, trying to turn a poli- uh, state into more of a police state, and people just mindlessly, and you can just see their body, brainlessly just signing this stuff, it's absolutely amazing.
[02:22:40.564 --> 02:22:46.668]  But anyway, getting to my point, I, most of you listeners I'm sure remember Flip Wilson, and uh,
[02:22:47.488 --> 02:22:53.510]  Remembering Flip Wilson, you know, you have to appreciate the way he told stories, but there was one skit that he did that I remember.
[02:22:53.550 --> 02:22:59.533]  You may have heard it, maybe some of your listeners may have heard it, but it was called, uh, Do Ruby Magonia Ring a Bell?
[02:22:59.873 --> 02:23:13.438]  Well, anyway, in the middle of this skit, there was a part where Flip Wilson was talking about the story in this, and you have to just picture how Flip Wilson did this, and at this time it was funny, but today, it's so right on, and of reality, it's unbelievable.
[02:23:13.758 --> 02:23:16.739]  But he talks about this king called King Magonia,
[02:23:17.139 --> 02:23:17.699]  We're good to go.
[02:23:38.849 --> 02:23:41.911]  All those that have anything shall be taken away from them!
[02:23:41.951 --> 02:23:44.272]  And everybody's still cheering for King Begonia!
[02:23:44.632 --> 02:23:45.492]  King Begonia!
[02:23:45.832 --> 02:23:49.874]  And then he says, and all those that have nothing shall have even less!
[02:23:50.234 --> 02:23:53.096]  And the people are just still cheering for King Begonia!
[02:23:53.456 --> 02:24:02.460]  I won't finish the whole story, because it gets into it, but this was just a bit in the middle of this skit, and when you look at it today, that's exactly, it seems like, what's going on!
[02:24:02.860 --> 02:24:04.161]  You know, what happened?
[02:24:04.381 --> 02:24:13.048]  In fact, we're going to send our reporters out, I think Mark Dice has already done that, we were planning it weeks ago, Great Minds Think Alike, to go out and say, let's ban pressure cookers now.
[02:24:13.448 --> 02:24:14.629]  In fact, I want that asked.
[02:24:14.649 --> 02:24:16.090]  We're going to be on the street today in Austin.
[02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:24.036]  We're going to go up and say, we want women's right to after birth abortion to be the law.
[02:24:25.777 --> 02:24:30.699]  Have a printout of the Journal of Bioethics having an article about killing children up to age three.
[02:24:30.719 --> 02:24:34.780]  And maybe print out the cover of the case for killing Granning on Newsweek.
[02:24:35.401 --> 02:24:39.102]  And then say, hi, we're here for the death panels.
[02:24:39.122 --> 02:24:44.244]  I'd like to sign a petition that Austin, Texas euthanize the old people.
[02:24:45.104 --> 02:24:55.591]  Uh, and then, but you've got to say it's liberal and go, uh, and as long as you go, uh, that's the key as we've shown in these.
[02:24:55.751 --> 02:25:02.175]  If you don't do the, uh, you've got to do that to activate their mind control to show.
[02:25:02.195 --> 02:25:03.797]  That's why NPR talks like that.
[02:25:04.217 --> 02:25:05.718]  It's it's all Delphi technique.
[02:25:06.238 --> 02:25:08.119]  It's very loving.
[02:25:08.139 --> 02:25:13.223]  I mean, they could have tanks just going, loving, loving.
[02:25:13.543 --> 02:25:16.725]  And people would walk and lay their children down in front of them for the treads to run over them.
[02:25:16.985 --> 02:25:18.366]  They would just dance around the blood.
[02:25:18.386 --> 02:25:21.988]  As long as the loudspeakers went, liberal, liberal.
[02:25:22.008 --> 02:25:22.709]  Do you understand that?
[02:25:23.149 --> 02:25:24.591]  They would just worship Obama.
[02:25:24.631 --> 02:25:27.454]  Just all Americans should bow to Obama a hundred times a day.
[02:25:27.714 --> 02:25:30.237]  And just have thousands of drones just bombing other countries.
[02:25:30.537 --> 02:25:34.902]  With huge video screens of the bombs coming in and splattering everybody.
[02:25:35.302 --> 02:25:38.706]  And just mountains of dead people and just worshipping that.
[02:25:39.086 --> 02:25:44.152]  With just huge loudspeakers going, ah, liberal, ah, it's liberal.
[02:25:44.392 --> 02:25:44.953]  How's that sound?
[02:25:45.819 --> 02:25:46.679]  Yeah, sounds great.
[02:25:46.739 --> 02:25:48.740]  Hey, one other thing, Alex.
[02:25:49.041 --> 02:25:51.582]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:25:51.602 --> 02:25:53.723]  That's not as good as Flip Wilson's King Begonia.
[02:25:55.984 --> 02:26:08.891]  One other thing, you mentioned earlier about, you know, getting involved with the political arena and going to these meetings and doing all this kind of stuff and everything and getting involved with this so we can, you know, take charge of some of these things.
[02:26:08.911 --> 02:26:14.954]  Well, anyway, I know a group of us here in Oregon, and this has been an ongoing issue right now for probably several years.
[02:26:16.214 --> 02:26:17.315]  I'm sorry, I was being liberal.
[02:26:17.435 --> 02:26:17.995]  That's all right.
[02:26:18.235 --> 02:26:28.600]  And the information we have gathered right now, we have a sheriff's department and eight county commissioners on the chopping block for racketeering and official misconduct with the evidence.
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:37.223]  We went to a meeting last night and there was a fireworks go, but we have this on tape, video, and everything of the crimes that these people have committed, including the sheriff's department.
[02:26:37.523 --> 02:26:38.744]  Yeah, put it on YouTube.
[02:26:38.784 --> 02:26:40.565]  Just keep going after them, brother.
[02:26:40.585 --> 02:26:42.085]  Put it on YouTube and we'll cover it.
[02:26:42.105 --> 02:26:42.646]  God bless you.
[02:26:42.666 --> 02:26:43.306]  Good to hear from you.
[02:26:43.966 --> 02:26:44.947]  Let's go to another one.
[02:26:44.967 --> 02:26:47.748]  I was illustrating absurdity by being absurd there earlier.
[02:26:49.269 --> 02:26:57.614]  I think they should give the bombs that they dropped on Libya and now that they're giving to Al Qaeda to attack Syria with, they should give the bombs peace prizes.
[02:26:59.696 --> 02:27:04.459]  They should give the UN forces that are involved in mass murder all over the world, they should give them peace prizes.
[02:27:04.479 --> 02:27:06.320]  They should give their bayonets peace prizes.
[02:27:07.464 --> 02:27:18.152]  As you put, like, bayonet cams on them when they stab villagers, because, you know, that's cheaper than just blowing them up or shooting them, like they helped the globalists to engage in Rwanda.
[02:27:18.773 --> 02:27:22.516]  Then they could give the machetes peace prizes.
[02:27:23.357 --> 02:27:25.939]  Let's go ahead now and go to the next caller here.
[02:27:25.979 --> 02:27:27.360]  I'm trying to punch up my call list.
[02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:29.121]  For some reason it's not there.
[02:27:30.882 --> 02:27:31.803]  Who's up next here?
[02:27:32.284 --> 02:27:33.605]  Steve in Chicago.
[02:27:34.225 --> 02:27:35.146]  You're on the air, Steve.
[02:27:35.953 --> 02:27:36.573]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:37.014 --> 02:27:42.298]  I want to say, hey, rough child, I'm not your Kapora, I'm not your Chalmer, I'm not your Nevish or Slamil.
[02:27:42.618 --> 02:27:43.699]  Do you read me?
[02:27:44.159 --> 02:27:46.301]  I wanted to also talk about a double agent.
[02:27:46.361 --> 02:27:47.422]  I've got to stop you, man.
[02:27:47.462 --> 02:27:49.063]  You've been calling for like 10 years.
[02:27:49.103 --> 02:27:50.824]  You have got the best voice.
[02:27:51.585 --> 02:27:56.568]  I want to get your phone number, even though you're always calling with the same racist stuff.
[02:27:57.609 --> 02:28:02.553]  And I'm not off what you just said with the Yiddish stuff, but like, you know, the anti-black stuff.
[02:28:03.013 --> 02:28:04.834]  You could have a career.
[02:28:05.936 --> 02:28:08.117]  Yeah, as a voice announcer with that voice.
[02:28:08.137 --> 02:28:12.640]  Sir, can you just say, the woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep?
[02:28:14.241 --> 02:28:15.622]  Uh, maybe next time.
[02:28:15.982 --> 02:28:18.083]  I wanted to talk about Senator John McCain.
[02:28:18.403 --> 02:28:21.165]  He's a three-star officer in the Latvian Army.
[02:28:21.545 --> 02:28:28.129]  He's the only officer, uh, naval aviator, to successfully kamikaze his own, uh, aircraft carrier.
[02:28:28.489 --> 02:28:30.911]  Also, what did he do with the Kading bribe money?
[02:28:31.231 --> 02:28:32.732]  But, I want to say one thing.
[02:28:32.752 --> 02:28:34.993]  You have an uncanny sense of being right.
[02:28:35.333 --> 02:28:37.935]  When you talk about these false flags, whether it's the St.
[02:28:37.995 --> 02:28:50.805]  Petersburg 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, where they burned down the Federal Criminal Archives and confiscated the guns, or it's the Bavarian Soviet Republic on April 14, 1919, when they occupied Munich.
[02:28:54.668 --> 02:28:55.169]  I don't know.
[02:29:08.542 --> 02:29:16.348]  When they occupied the Vienna Justice Ministry in 1927, the first thing they did, turn in your firearms.
[02:29:16.628 --> 02:29:27.476]  The other issues, you know, you were talking about the Cheka cork room, where they put you in a small confined area and slowly put corks in the wall so that you gradually suffocate.
[02:29:27.656 --> 02:29:28.657]  That's one of their tortures.
[02:29:28.897 --> 02:29:31.839]  But you mentioned this before about these women in the CIA.
[02:29:32.219 --> 02:29:34.261]  They call it Dora the Glovemaker.
[02:29:34.861 --> 02:29:35.762]  You read up on it.
[02:29:36.062 --> 02:29:37.043]  See if I'm not right.
[02:29:37.364 --> 02:29:38.705]  I want to come back to you.
[02:29:39.165 --> 02:29:43.189]  You've got to say McGruff helped take a bite out of crime.
[02:29:43.249 --> 02:29:43.509]  Say it.
[02:29:46.652 --> 02:29:47.013]  Come on.
[02:29:48.514 --> 02:29:50.075]  Don't hang up, Steve in Chicago.
[02:29:50.116 --> 02:29:50.896]  I'm coming back to you.
[02:29:50.936 --> 02:29:51.777]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.298 --> 02:29:53.899]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.820 --> 02:29:57.502]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.130 --> 02:30:13.437]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.

[02:30:26.965 --> 02:30:30.967]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[02:30:31.067 --> 02:30:31.327]  I think so.

[02:32:01.423 --> 02:32:04.145]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:32:04.425 --> 02:32:09.249]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:32:09.449 --> 02:32:16.595]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:32:16.755 --> 02:32:22.161]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:32:22.401 --> 02:32:26.125]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:32:26.425 --> 02:32:30.950]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:32:31.150 --> 02:32:36.356]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.

[02:32:59.131 --> 02:32:59.911]  Infowarshop.com
[02:33:05.336 --> 02:33:11.340]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:18.706 --> 02:33:20.107]  Yeah, groovy!
[02:33:20.927 --> 02:33:23.069]  We're back live, your host Alex Jones here.
[02:33:24.198 --> 02:33:37.126]  Ladies and gentlemen, the media is now running around like chickens with their heads cut off, declaring the evil of Alex Jones, trying to twist or take things out of context, or taking some of my satire out of context, which is fine.
[02:33:37.666 --> 02:33:41.689]  Let them demonize, let them say what they want, let them write what they want.
[02:33:42.169 --> 02:33:46.111]  We are awakening humanity to the fact that there is a lot of stuff going on.
[02:33:46.732 --> 02:33:47.992]  I am your rude awakening.
[02:33:48.012 --> 02:33:49.653]  I am trying to be the wake-up call.
[02:33:49.994 --> 02:33:51.915]  What you wake up and see is your own issue.
[02:33:52.719 --> 02:33:57.500]  It doesn't mean you have to agree with me on everything, because I don't even agree with myself on everything.
[02:33:57.540 --> 02:34:01.081]  Sometimes I hear a rebroadcast and don't agree with what I said, the way it came off.
[02:34:01.161 --> 02:34:01.781]  It doesn't matter.
[02:34:01.841 --> 02:34:02.741]  At least I'm real.
[02:34:04.002 --> 02:34:12.864]  And it will be reality, not illusion and delusion, that will turn this country and this civilization around and point it back in the right direction, towards the stars!
[02:34:13.744 --> 02:34:19.065]  Now, I'm very excited about Operation Greedy Goblin.
[02:34:20.219 --> 02:34:32.027]  Being sarcastic, that's not the name of the operation, but I think if Salon was claiming I had operations, they would, they write about me every day now, Dave and I, I guess they like the attention when I talk about them, that would be Operation Greedy Goblin.
[02:34:32.727 --> 02:34:40.072]  No, no, we have Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant that is 11 memberships with one membership.
[02:34:40.092 --> 02:34:42.134]  You sign up and you can give a username, passcode.
[02:34:43.115 --> 02:34:56.327]  Uh, that you create to 11 people to be simultaneously logged on to see the video of the Daily Radio Show that has a lot of other video and information and clips and documents and articles and guests and the nightly news.
[02:34:57.368 --> 02:35:04.235]  And you then also help fund our operation, though I've kind of got InfoWars Nightly News set up where, um,
[02:35:05.578 --> 02:35:07.398]  I've got InfoWars Nightly News, shut up.
[02:35:07.919 --> 02:35:10.939]  It's weird when you're trying to center yourself looking at an iPhone, because it's like backwards.
[02:35:10.999 --> 02:35:14.880]  It's like trying to read something, you know, when it's in a mirror.
[02:35:15.761 --> 02:35:16.881]  Yes, inch to my right.
[02:35:17.041 --> 02:35:17.541]  My right?
[02:35:19.022 --> 02:35:19.882]  Am I right now?
[02:35:20.062 --> 02:35:20.502]  I'm right?
[02:35:22.983 --> 02:35:23.643]  I think I'm good.
[02:35:23.923 --> 02:35:29.004]  You know, the more I think about it, I haven't even been looking at the camera I'm on today, and I just kind of looked up and saw I was crooked on screen.
[02:35:30.585 --> 02:35:31.585]  What was I just now getting at?
[02:35:32.739 --> 02:35:34.180]  What was I talking about before that happened?
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:36.161]  Oh yeah, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:36.561 --> 02:35:39.042]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership today.
[02:35:39.482 --> 02:35:40.403]  Wake some people up.
[02:35:40.463 --> 02:35:43.985]  I mean, I would say most of your friends and family aren't going to end up using it.
[02:35:44.565 --> 02:35:50.888]  So I would go create a unique username passcode at PrisonPlanet.tv, or if you already have one and want to change it, that's fine.
[02:35:51.409 --> 02:35:53.370]  Don't share your passcode if it's to other stuff.
[02:35:53.410 --> 02:35:55.771]  Create a unique username passcode.
[02:35:57.252 --> 02:36:01.454]  And I would say send it out to 30 friends and family.
[02:36:02.913 --> 02:36:08.137]  As an e-card, you know, say, hey, here's your subscription gift to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:08.337 --> 02:36:09.818]  I'm allowed to share my subscription.
[02:36:10.118 --> 02:36:10.839]  Here's your gift.
[02:36:11.179 --> 02:36:12.079]  Go see Endgame.
[02:36:12.099 --> 02:36:13.500]  Go see the Obama deception.
[02:36:13.841 --> 02:36:19.585]  Go see this special report with Dr. Busby about the dangers of Fukushima radiation.
[02:36:20.145 --> 02:36:28.451]  Go see this report with his top scientist on the Harvard studies of sodium fluoride lowering IQ and reducing fertility, and then we show the documents where it was all planned.
[02:36:29.673 --> 02:36:39.457]  There is eleven years now, well really more than that because I put a lot of the stuff on before I had PrisonPlanet.tv, but eleven plus years of material on PrisonPlanet.tv and now it's up there the last few years in HD.
[02:36:39.497 --> 02:36:45.720]  You have the live streams and all the rest of it, they're not in HD obviously because you wouldn't be able to on most computers get an HD stream.
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:56.305]  But it's all there, so get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership today and also get the new May issue that deals with the big questions of the Boston bombing
[02:36:57.185 --> 02:36:58.866]  Uh, and the history of false flags.
[02:36:58.986 --> 02:37:02.867]  Very important issue, and we'll probably sell out the fastest of any issue we've had.
[02:37:02.927 --> 02:37:04.068]  Most issues have sold out.
[02:37:04.528 --> 02:37:09.190]  At cost, with three InfoWars full-size bumper stickers inside.
[02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:12.131]  And, if you are in Central Texas,
[02:37:14.195 --> 02:37:21.518]  There are 60,000 in Austin and 20,000 in San Antonio, and then a few thousand others in some other hill country areas.
[02:37:22.059 --> 02:37:31.523]  You can go to restaurants or wherever, and when you see a stack of these, take four or five copies and give them to friends and family, but make sure they all get put up.
[02:37:32.843 --> 02:37:36.245]  Make sure, but do not put them on anybody's private property.
[02:37:36.605 --> 02:37:38.246]  Put them on your private property.
[02:37:39.304 --> 02:37:44.526]  Or in commons areas where it is common practice for people to put up bumper stickers.
[02:37:44.566 --> 02:37:47.328]  And you know, there's restaurants where they want you to put your bumper sticker up.
[02:37:47.688 --> 02:37:51.450]  There's like the sides of bars where there's thousands of bumper stickers.
[02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:52.450]  You know, stuff like that.
[02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:57.492]  But only put it in legal and lawful areas.
[02:37:58.173 --> 02:38:04.656]  And then again, if you want to order, say, 10 magazines at cost, and get them for like $14, I think that's what 10 of the magazines cost, isn't it?
[02:38:05.356 --> 02:38:07.097]  Because that includes the shipping and everything.
[02:38:10.101 --> 02:38:10.641]  Okay.
[02:38:12.062 --> 02:38:15.786]  Then you can have 30 bumper stickers.
[02:38:16.106 --> 02:38:17.047]  These are high quality.
[02:38:17.067 --> 02:38:19.609]  These are like, you know, the type that last years.
[02:38:20.310 --> 02:38:23.913]  So, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time.
[02:38:24.133 --> 02:38:25.615]  Infowarrestore.com.
[02:38:25.935 --> 02:38:26.515]  Enough of that.
[02:38:27.836 --> 02:38:32.078]  Let's go ahead and continue to stir up the hornet's nest, folks.
[02:38:32.098 --> 02:38:33.938]  They're not going to like these bumper stickers going up everywhere.
[02:38:34.278 --> 02:38:36.519]  The average bumper sticker is seen thousands of times in a year.
[02:38:37.079 --> 02:38:40.781]  So this is going to be tens of millions more people that see InfoWars.com and ask, what is that?
[02:38:41.781 --> 02:38:44.082]  Steve in Chicago, look, your voice is so interesting.
[02:38:44.462 --> 02:38:48.383]  Can you just say, McGruff, help take a bite out of crime?
[02:38:48.823 --> 02:38:49.804]  Can you say that for me, Steve?
[02:38:49.824 --> 02:38:53.585]  McGruff, help take a bite out of crime.
[02:38:54.386 --> 02:38:55.247]  Just like Alex.
[02:38:55.647 --> 02:38:56.247]  I learned it from you.
[02:38:56.267 --> 02:38:56.727]  Oh my gosh.
[02:38:56.747 --> 02:39:00.430]  I mean, you, you, you, you, you absolutely... J-O-N-E-S.
[02:39:01.010 --> 02:39:01.811]  Robert E. Lee.
[02:39:02.271 --> 02:39:03.331]  Alex E. Jones.
[02:39:03.712 --> 02:39:05.333]  Long live the Confederacy.
[02:39:06.273 --> 02:39:07.874]  Long live the Confederacy.
[02:39:08.535 --> 02:39:09.155]  One other thing.
[02:39:09.475 --> 02:39:09.975]  I'll leave you.
[02:39:10.356 --> 02:39:11.857]  This Chris Crispy character.
[02:39:12.717 --> 02:39:14.438]  Alex and I are not going to jail.
[02:39:14.878 --> 02:39:17.180]  You're going to jail, you 300 pound canary.
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:19.321]  What did you do with Hoffa's body?
[02:39:19.681 --> 02:39:20.822]  That's what we want to know.
[02:39:21.402 --> 02:39:22.043]  I'll let you know.
[02:39:23.359 --> 02:39:25.601]  You know why Chris Christie's so fat and loves Obama?
[02:39:26.602 --> 02:39:27.623]  Do you know why, Steve?
[02:39:28.204 --> 02:39:28.404]  No.
[02:39:29.645 --> 02:39:30.426]  Because he ate him.
[02:39:30.906 --> 02:39:33.649]  Well, they are cannibals.
[02:39:34.850 --> 02:39:36.211]  I can see media matters now.
[02:39:36.371 --> 02:39:40.215]  Jones believes that the governor of New Jersey ate Jimmy Hoffa.
[02:39:43.086 --> 02:39:45.367]  He actually went to a health spa and took him as an enema.
[02:39:45.487 --> 02:39:46.467]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[02:39:46.847 --> 02:39:48.547]  I'm completely out of control now.
[02:39:48.888 --> 02:39:50.788]  That's not a family thing to say.
[02:39:50.808 --> 02:39:52.489]  I apologize.
[02:39:53.129 --> 02:39:56.450]  He's got the rotting body of Jimmy Hoffa inside of him.
[02:39:56.470 --> 02:39:57.710]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:39:58.510 --> 02:40:00.471]  Man, you cannot call in Steve.
[02:40:00.931 --> 02:40:04.192]  Why don't you repent for... Oh, he just hung up.
[02:40:05.372 --> 02:40:06.752]  Steve hasn't gotten in in a couple years.
[02:40:07.253 --> 02:40:09.173]  That guy's been calling me for like 17 years.
[02:40:10.453 --> 02:40:11.874]  Since I first got syndicated.
[02:40:13.207 --> 02:40:18.328]  Uh, and, uh, about 16 and a half, and, uh, that guy is hilarious.
[02:40:18.348 --> 02:40:18.888]  Did you hear him?
[02:40:19.909 --> 02:40:21.749]  You 300-pound canary.
[02:40:22.029 --> 02:40:24.170]  I think he weighs more than 300 pounds, man.
[02:40:24.410 --> 02:40:25.970]  Let's not be mean to fat people.
[02:40:26.330 --> 02:40:34.332]  I can go swim two miles, lift weights, run, do whatever I want, and, uh, I guess I have lost some weight.
[02:40:35.387 --> 02:40:37.369]  Let me start by saying I appreciate what you're doing.
[02:40:55.262 --> 02:41:00.565]  I got a few quick points I want to say and then I'll get to what I initially called in for.
[02:41:01.306 --> 02:41:12.372]  I'm from Nebraska and the woman, the lesbian that supposedly got held down by the two men and cut up and they tried to kill her and burn her house down, yeah, that happened here in Lincoln, Nebraska.
[02:41:12.812 --> 02:41:19.376]  I called Red Flag on that and became a serious striking post for all my friends because I'm supposedly a bigot.
[02:41:20.544 --> 02:41:24.307]  Second thing, you talk about martial law and police state.
[02:41:24.687 --> 02:41:33.394]  My sister, last weekend, in Kansas, refused to do a breathalyzer because she wasn't drunk.
[02:41:33.734 --> 02:41:35.596]  They gave her a DUI, put her in jail anyways.
[02:41:36.556 --> 02:41:38.097]  And they said, yeah, you get a DUI.
[02:41:38.158 --> 02:41:42.461]  No, no, no, that's what the courts do now, is they just say you're drunk with no proof.
[02:41:42.541 --> 02:41:46.344]  It's like, well, you don't do the breathalyzer and you're sticking up for your Fourth Amendment.
[02:41:47.635 --> 02:41:52.658]  And I've seen reports where people are coming out of church and they'll go, you know, we're going to do a breathalyzer.
[02:41:52.718 --> 02:41:53.658]  No, I haven't been drinking.
[02:41:53.698 --> 02:41:54.799]  No, you can't search my car.
[02:41:55.099 --> 02:42:02.043]  There was an article up yesterday on InfoWars where it's a warrantless checkpoint and they just arrest people if they don't let you search the car.
[02:42:02.683 --> 02:42:11.448]  And of course I have that in my film Road to Tyranny where she pulls up, Navy veteran, no criminal record, in town buying canning supplies.
[02:42:12.406 --> 02:42:14.429]  And they want to search her car, and she goes, no, you can't.
[02:42:14.449 --> 02:42:15.370]  They're searching the cars.
[02:42:16.031 --> 02:42:17.754]  And they weren't looking for a bank robber.
[02:42:17.834 --> 02:42:18.575]  This was in Virginia.
[02:42:18.595 --> 02:42:20.198]  They were just doing checkpoints in a rural area.
[02:42:20.578 --> 02:42:21.159]  State police.
[02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:27.388]  And they get into her trunk while she's in handcuffs now in the back of the car, and they go, it's all on video.
[02:42:27.649 --> 02:42:28.149]  And they go, look.
[02:42:29.195 --> 02:42:30.596]  And it was Patriot games.
[02:42:30.636 --> 02:42:35.238]  They were scared of a VHS tape of Harrison Ford.
[02:42:35.258 --> 02:42:36.519]  The word Patriot scared them.
[02:42:36.919 --> 02:42:38.680]  Because finally they found one of the terrorists.
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:40.680]  You know, they talk about Patriots, they're terrorists.
[02:42:41.221 --> 02:42:42.401]  And then it got bad.
[02:42:42.441 --> 02:42:46.343]  They found a pocket constitution in my film Police State.
[02:42:46.383 --> 02:42:49.885]  And the police go, I don't know if this is legal.
[02:42:50.385 --> 02:42:54.167]  And they start going... Folks, I'm not joking.
[02:42:54.687 --> 02:42:58.169]  The head state police guy goes, I don't know if this is legal.
[02:42:59.776 --> 02:43:02.017]  Is that the right she's talking about?
[02:43:02.037 --> 02:43:03.819]  Does it mean she's allowed to have it?
[02:43:04.759 --> 02:43:09.002]  I don't know if this contraband is legal.
[02:43:09.142 --> 02:43:15.285]  That is extremist stuff.
[02:43:15.706 --> 02:43:18.127]  I mean, it was like Porky Pig with a lobotomy.
[02:43:18.928 --> 02:43:20.088]  And they take her to jail.
[02:43:20.369 --> 02:43:22.710]  And the trial was on TV.
[02:43:23.410 --> 02:43:29.074]  And the trial, it was like that listener in Lyon County, Kentucky, Kelly Rushing.
[02:43:30.458 --> 02:43:33.142]  He calls in and goes, I got arrested for handing out your films.
[02:43:34.378 --> 02:43:41.463]  I gave a state police officer them and then he pulled me over the next day and laughed to his wife on the cell phone, I've got the VHS bandit.
[02:43:42.004 --> 02:43:43.525]  And they charged him three counts.
[02:43:43.765 --> 02:43:48.368]  It was a Ron Paul speech called Neocond on slow play VHS tape.
[02:43:48.748 --> 02:43:50.710]  My film Road to Tyranny and one other film.
[02:43:51.070 --> 02:43:54.292]  And they said this is anti-police and we find it threatening.
[02:43:54.733 --> 02:43:55.773]  And they took him to trial.
[02:43:55.813 --> 02:43:57.515]  Kelly Rushing was in the local paper.
[02:43:57.955 --> 02:43:59.136]  And I didn't believe him at first.
[02:43:59.196 --> 02:44:00.957]  I was still naive, you know, like 11 years ago.
[02:44:00.977 --> 02:44:01.978]  This is right when the film came out.
[02:44:02.678 --> 02:44:03.659]  That was about 10 years ago.
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:10.286]  And so I called the paper and they go, yes, Mr. Rushing is being charged.
[02:44:11.066 --> 02:44:12.007]  And I was like, okay.
[02:44:12.047 --> 02:44:13.529]  And then I called the judge at home.
[02:44:14.189 --> 02:44:18.734]  He's like, yes, Mr. Jones, I can't talk about the trial, but yes, we're going to be having the trial next week.
[02:44:18.894 --> 02:44:19.955]  You'll have to follow it there.
[02:44:20.535 --> 02:44:21.436]  And I was like, what?
[02:44:21.456 --> 02:44:23.098]  So I called and got a hold of Kelly Rushing.
[02:44:23.138 --> 02:44:23.979]  I kept his number.
[02:44:23.999 --> 02:44:25.760]  You ought to report on this for Esquire.
[02:44:26.781 --> 02:44:29.543]  And, uh, they went to trial and tried to put him in jail.
[02:44:30.003 --> 02:44:35.067]  I think it was seven years, it was five years in jail for each count, if I have memory serves.
[02:44:35.147 --> 02:44:37.148]  It was going to be consecutive, 15 years in prison.
[02:44:37.849 --> 02:44:43.493]  And, uh, the cop got up and, and, and rushing got up in his own defense and said, I, I gave him the video.
[02:44:43.733 --> 02:44:50.418]  And I said, and then when he pulled me over a couple of days later, the next day, whatever it was, he said, that was anti-law enforcement.
[02:44:50.438 --> 02:44:53.840]  Oh, and one of the charges was also, the guy said, why did you give me that?
[02:44:53.860 --> 02:44:56.002]  And he said, well, I care about you and your family.
[02:44:56.894 --> 02:44:59.595]  And then that was a charge mentioning his family.
[02:45:01.275 --> 02:45:04.096]  Mentioning his family was another threat.
[02:45:04.676 --> 02:45:12.018]  And it turned out Kelly Rushing was like a prominent family, all, you know, pillars in the community, bunch of, you know, nice people.
[02:45:12.778 --> 02:45:15.979]  But in America, they have a hunger to literally put us in jail.
[02:45:16.579 --> 02:45:18.960]  So, and I'm sorry, Travis in Nebraska.
[02:45:18.980 --> 02:45:20.080]  Yeah, I have the articles.
[02:45:21.204 --> 02:45:21.424]  I think?
[02:45:38.954 --> 02:45:39.034]  Yes.
[02:45:53.831 --> 02:45:54.011]  I mean,
[02:46:19.617 --> 02:46:27.985]  And this is happening all over the country and the media has articles about struggling with reporting it because maybe we deserve it!
[02:46:28.265 --> 02:46:35.011]  Maybe whites should all walk out in public and slit their throats, find a black person, grab a big double-edged knife and just go,
[02:46:35.832 --> 02:46:36.333]  I am evil!
[02:46:37.373 --> 02:46:38.834]  Just splayed blood all over me.
[02:46:39.194 --> 02:46:39.855]  Just bleed out.
[02:46:40.115 --> 02:46:43.858]  And then Chris Matthews will dance in the blood and it'll be a big celebration.
[02:46:43.878 --> 02:46:50.962]  I mean, you know, I mean, that probably wouldn't be because whites are being murdered, tortured, killed, attacked all over the country.
[02:46:50.982 --> 02:46:53.564]  And there's never going to be a candlelight vigil.
[02:46:53.804 --> 02:46:55.886]  The news won't even say that it's blacks doing it.
[02:46:56.126 --> 02:47:01.329]  And again, I love black people, but there are racist black people filled full of this whole thing.
[02:47:01.729 --> 02:47:05.212]  And that's all the media trying to create division in this country.
[02:47:05.992 --> 02:47:12.374]  The media wants to create division and wants to keep people fighting with each other in this nation.
[02:47:12.654 --> 02:47:13.374]  So what do you think?
[02:47:13.454 --> 02:47:33.059]  I think they should erect giant wood chippers in every town center, run by the city and police so it's all safe and for the children, and that people that want to prove that they're bad, evil whites that want to prove that they're bad, that they just walk up the stairs, they turn it on, and everybody claps, and you throw yourself into a high-powered wood chipper.
[02:47:33.099 --> 02:47:33.639]  How does that sound?
[02:47:34.867 --> 02:47:36.208]  Because you're a racist.
[02:47:55.205 --> 02:47:56.686]  Yeah, because I'm racist.
[02:47:56.746 --> 02:48:01.307]  No, long story short, I went septic.
[02:48:01.367 --> 02:48:03.168]  Septic shock, everything.
[02:48:03.648 --> 02:48:06.449]  They couldn't tell me what was wrong with me in the hospital.
[02:48:06.629 --> 02:48:10.571]  It was a miracle, like a 1% chance of me surviving it.
[02:48:10.591 --> 02:48:16.853]  I had five or six surgeries, three days ICU for a week, in the hospital for about a month.
[02:48:18.088 --> 02:48:18.569]  I don't know.
[02:48:34.062 --> 02:48:34.502]  Here's the deal.
[02:48:34.522 --> 02:48:36.924]  The third world takes antibiotics like it's candy.
[02:48:36.964 --> 02:48:38.004]  It's sold in all the shops.
[02:48:38.744 --> 02:48:46.488]  All this antibiotic cream, ointments, the soaps here, are making the bugs absolutely high-powered.
[02:48:46.749 --> 02:48:50.130]  Within three generations, with most insects, they become resistant or immune.
[02:48:50.471 --> 02:48:53.532]  Within ten generations, almost all of them become completely immune to poison.
[02:48:53.872 --> 02:48:58.435]  What do you think happens with bacteria, whose life cycle is a lot quicker than even insects?
[02:48:59.095 --> 02:49:02.237]  Arachnids, bugs, you name it, whatever the type of insect is.
[02:49:03.437 --> 02:49:04.818]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:49:05.019 --> 02:49:08.862]  There is just hordes of disease pouring in.
[02:49:08.882 --> 02:49:11.564]  And I feel sorry for the third world.
[02:49:12.365 --> 02:49:13.746]  I mean, I wish we could help them.
[02:49:14.126 --> 02:49:26.677]  But the point is, instead, America and the globalists and their lust to collapse things quicker and to get a voting bloc that has no history of freedom, there are just parasites and brain parasites and weird mosquitoes.
[02:49:26.757 --> 02:49:27.698]  I mean, look at fire ants.
[02:49:27.718 --> 02:49:28.579]  They came from Brazil.
[02:49:29.239 --> 02:49:40.602]  Where now under globalism, I mean, it's kind of like Westerners coming here who were immune to smallpox or resistant because all their ancestors had already died from it, so they have the genetics to be resistant, and it wiped out most of the natives.
[02:49:40.622 --> 02:49:45.163]  That wiped out, some estimates are, 90% of the natives, so they didn't have to even be killed.
[02:49:46.404 --> 02:49:47.464]  And again, that was wrong.
[02:49:47.524 --> 02:49:51.105]  But the point is, is that, what were you getting at with this loving parasite?
[02:49:51.125 --> 02:49:53.826]  What type of loving parasite was it, you racist?
[02:49:55.423 --> 02:49:56.084]  I survived.
[02:49:56.505 --> 02:50:00.012]  I went from 185 to 148 in three weeks.
[02:50:00.834 --> 02:50:01.395]  It was a miracle.
[02:50:01.415 --> 02:50:02.958]  The doctors, it was a whole thing.
[02:50:02.998 --> 02:50:05.183]  What is the loving parasite racist?
[02:50:05.704 --> 02:50:05.924]  Okay.
[02:50:06.818 --> 02:50:12.201]  Anyway, since I've walked out of that hospital, I have been called by different government agencies.
[02:50:13.121 --> 02:50:18.924]  They've identified themselves as a Bureau of something, my taxes.
[02:50:19.504 --> 02:50:25.827]  They've asked, it doesn't matter what, I've had 10 or 11 phone calls and they say the same thing every single time.
[02:50:25.907 --> 02:50:26.748]  Where are you living?
[02:50:27.208 --> 02:50:27.968]  What are you doing?
[02:50:28.248 --> 02:50:29.049]  Where are you working?
[02:50:29.189 --> 02:50:29.929]  Are you married?
[02:50:30.129 --> 02:50:31.430]  Has your family gotten sick?
[02:50:32.489 --> 02:50:34.250]  We'll be in contact with you in the next two weeks.
[02:50:34.291 --> 02:50:36.572]  And I mean, I'm getting calls from all over Minnesota, Ohio.
[02:50:36.672 --> 02:50:38.033]  What is the parasite?
[02:50:38.194 --> 02:50:39.475]  What is the parasite?
[02:50:39.875 --> 02:50:41.336]  Penicillium arfilii.
[02:50:41.656 --> 02:50:46.600]  And it's an unidentified form of Penicillium arfilii that they think came from Southeast Asia.
[02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:50.243]  From a scrape on your elbow from flag football.
[02:50:50.811 --> 02:50:52.793]  Sir, prove that you're not a racist.
[02:50:53.814 --> 02:50:55.276]  Worship the government today.
[02:50:55.296 --> 02:50:58.139]  Folks, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:50:58.199 --> 02:51:02.264]  No one go throw themselves on a wood chipper to prove that you love the government.
[02:51:02.284 --> 02:51:05.067]  Be prepared by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:51:05.407 --> 02:51:10.813]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:51:11.434 --> 02:51:14.620]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[02:51:15.281 --> 02:51:16.543]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[02:51:16.863 --> 02:51:20.710]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[02:51:21.311 --> 02:51:23.335]  Go to GetSimpliSafe.com
[02:51:23.996 --> 02:51:26.398]  SimpliSafe is independent and off the grid.
[02:51:26.718 --> 02:51:30.501]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[02:51:31.062 --> 02:51:37.186]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer, storage unit, or shed.
[02:51:37.687 --> 02:51:39.288]  Get SimpliSafe.com.
[02:51:40.009 --> 02:51:46.814]  SimpliSafe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes, so there's no need to let a stranger into your home.
[02:51:47.298 --> 02:51:47.759]  We're good to go.
[02:52:03.539 --> 02:52:09.806]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[02:52:10.146 --> 02:52:18.155]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:52:18.655 --> 02:52:22.779]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:27.304]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:52:27.584 --> 02:52:29.887]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids.
[02:52:30.147 --> 02:52:35.353]  And all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[02:52:35.713 --> 02:52:39.217]  With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Way.
[02:52:39.597 --> 02:52:40.497]  My name is Daniel.
[02:52:40.617 --> 02:52:41.798]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:52:41.838 --> 02:52:45.559]  When I started using One World Way, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:52:45.799 --> 02:52:49.360]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:52:49.500 --> 02:52:50.641]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:52:50.801 --> 02:52:57.463]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:52:57.483 --> 02:53:00.504]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:00.964 --> 02:53:05.085]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:05.725 --> 02:53:07.846]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:08.756 --> 02:53:17.101]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.721 --> 02:53:22.644]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:23.274 --> 02:53:34.245]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:34.646 --> 02:53:41.653]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:42.333 --> 02:53:46.597]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:46.637 --> 02:53:49.799]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:50.219 --> 02:53:57.185]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:53:57.485 --> 02:53:58.506]  Protect your immune system.
[02:53:58.766 --> 02:53:59.807]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:53:59.827 --> 02:54:07.353]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man.
[02:54:13.677 --> 02:54:27.722]  You know, ladies and gentlemen, I get a little bit cynical sometimes in dark on air, because this stuff gets to me.
[02:54:27.782 --> 02:54:29.342]  I have extreme empathy.
[02:54:31.543 --> 02:54:34.364]  Not because I'm some goody-two-shoes person, I just have basic instincts.
[02:54:35.486 --> 02:54:41.851]  When I see all this death, all this destruction, all this corruption going on, and the government, they tell us when we're supposed to care.
[02:54:41.871 --> 02:54:43.633]  And I know I've been obsessing on that lately.
[02:54:45.134 --> 02:54:46.595]  But I don't just turn it on and off.
[02:54:47.496 --> 02:54:50.218]  Like, don't you care about the Boston bombing and those that died?
[02:54:50.558 --> 02:54:51.319]  Yes, I do care.
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:53.801]  And I want to get to the bottom
[02:54:55.103 --> 02:55:06.026]  of who killed them, or who let terrorists kill them, and I don't want their deaths to be used as sacrifices to convert America to a police state for the security of the state.
[02:55:06.506 --> 02:55:09.986]  There's always that excuse, and every time it leads to hell on earth.
[02:55:10.787 --> 02:55:11.907]  That's what I'm getting at here.
[02:55:13.307 --> 02:55:18.848]  So Travis in Nebraska finishing up, say the name of that parasite again so we can pull it up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:55:19.229 --> 02:55:20.749]  What are they saying it is, Travis?
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:27.363]  They sent my blood to six or seven different places and they all came back, we can't identify this.
[02:55:27.883 --> 02:55:34.966]  The best they could do was say it's a strand of, I hope I'm pronouncing it right, penicillium filii, I believe.
[02:55:35.446 --> 02:55:38.688]  And they said the closest relative it has is out of Southeast Asia.
[02:55:38.748 --> 02:55:43.450]  So it was like a one... Well, a penicillium, well it could have come in on dust and stuff against the atmosphere.
[02:55:43.470 --> 02:55:45.891]  It could have come in from outer space.
[02:55:45.951 --> 02:55:48.232]  But I mean, penicillium, isn't that in a fungus family?
[02:55:48.872 --> 02:55:49.692]  Yeah, it's a fungus, yeah.
[02:55:49.712 --> 02:55:50.232]  A mold?
[02:55:50.252 --> 02:55:51.173]  Or a mold family, yeah?
[02:55:51.573 --> 02:55:51.733]  Yep.
[02:55:52.773 --> 02:55:53.874]  Alright, very interesting.
[02:55:55.774 --> 02:55:56.994]  Travis, just go with it.
[02:55:57.095 --> 02:56:01.796]  You should have given your body over to the fungus and have been one with it like in Creepshow.
[02:56:02.056 --> 02:56:03.136]  I'm glad to hear you're better, man.
[02:56:03.176 --> 02:56:03.657]  God bless you.
[02:56:03.957 --> 02:56:07.398]  Man, I tell you, I ran into so many people in Hot Springs, Arkansas where I'm at right now.
[02:56:07.418 --> 02:56:11.139]  We extended our stay because one of our kids got a cold.
[02:56:11.859 --> 02:56:13.119]  A lot of people sick this year.
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:18.141]  And so, we were like doing the show from here and we're now coming back tomorrow.
[02:56:19.516 --> 02:56:24.639]  But I'm coming to you from a very historic place.
[02:56:24.799 --> 02:56:28.381]  The hotel was nice and let us have this through the broadcast.
[02:56:28.401 --> 02:56:30.562]  And I'm going to plug the hotel tomorrow, right before I leave.
[02:56:31.623 --> 02:56:38.227]  We've already had, let me not exaggerate, about 15 different groups of people show up, figuring out where I'm at.
[02:56:38.247 --> 02:56:42.689]  And you feel really bad, you know, hanging out with them, taking photos and stuff when you've got to go somewhere.
[02:56:43.269 --> 02:56:44.750]  And they're inviting you to dinner and stuff.
[02:56:44.770 --> 02:56:47.492]  But just, I tell you, Arkansas is just the nicest people.
[02:56:48.652 --> 02:56:53.545]  I mean, I've been all over the country, and I've been coming here since I was a kid, but Arkansas, that's why we stayed more days.
[02:56:53.565 --> 02:56:54.508]  We're just having a great time.
[02:56:56.005 --> 02:56:58.326]  And I'll be back live on the radio tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:56:58.346 --> 02:56:59.247]  to 2 p.m.
[02:56:59.307 --> 02:57:01.548]  Nightly News is coming up this evening.
[02:57:01.748 --> 02:57:06.710]  I may compose myself more and do a video Skype into the show tonight, because I've got a whole bunch of news I want to cover.
[02:57:07.751 --> 02:57:12.333]  But we're going to go into about five minutes of overdrive, too, to make sure that I can get to these calls that I've been holding.
[02:57:12.753 --> 02:57:18.416]  Tom in North Carolina, you want to talk about the Colorado Theater shooter, never mind the man behind the curtain.
[02:57:18.896 --> 02:57:19.977]  What's your take on that, sir?
[02:57:20.917 --> 02:57:21.677]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:57:21.918 --> 02:57:22.698]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[02:57:23.644 --> 02:57:26.978]  Okay, am I understanding you right with the home story?
[02:57:27.118 --> 02:57:29.347]  Was he forced to take Truth Serum?
[02:57:31.434 --> 02:57:33.115]  Yeah, you can pull up the articles.
[02:57:33.175 --> 02:57:34.836]  They've been drugging him the whole time.
[02:57:35.396 --> 02:57:38.438]  And to even get into it, there's just hundreds of points.
[02:57:39.458 --> 02:57:43.120]  And now they're talking about drugging him with truth serum to make him tell the truth.
[02:57:43.140 --> 02:57:50.344]  Well, the sodium pentothal and the other stuff, the halcyon, other stuff they're putting him on, is what you do to make people just say whatever you want.
[02:57:50.624 --> 02:57:58.428]  You can put somebody on these drugs and say, say that you're, you know, I love Lucy, or say that you're an Easter Bunny, and people will say they are.
[02:57:58.748 --> 02:57:59.909]  It's not really truth serum.
[02:58:00.788 --> 02:58:03.289]  It just makes you be so out of your head that you'll just babble.
[02:58:03.329 --> 02:58:03.990]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:58:04.010 --> 02:58:06.131]  Yeah, I don't know why I can't believe it.
[02:58:06.151 --> 02:58:07.612]  I mean, I really should with everything they've done.
[02:58:07.652 --> 02:58:11.674]  I mean, look what they're doing to the 1st, the 2nd, the 4th, the 6th Amendment.
[02:58:11.694 --> 02:58:13.375]  Why not go after the 5th a little more?
[02:58:13.395 --> 02:58:18.898]  You know, I know it says, you know, that no one should be compelled to be a witness against himself.
[02:58:18.938 --> 02:58:20.158]  How is that not a violation?
[02:58:20.178 --> 02:58:21.559]  I just don't understand.
[02:58:21.959 --> 02:58:28.163]  We really need to come together and have the mentality, like the gun owners of America, you know, just a no-compromise attitude towards our liberties.
[02:58:29.088 --> 02:58:29.648]  Irritates me so much.
[02:58:29.748 --> 02:58:30.489]  Listen, listen.
[02:58:30.769 --> 02:58:34.750]  There was a doctor, dentist up in, I think it was Kansas City, named Dr. Sell.
[02:58:36.111 --> 02:58:37.151]  I'll talk about it when we come back.
[02:58:37.171 --> 02:58:38.212]  InfoWars.com.

[03:00:06.243 --> 03:00:10.427]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:11.087 --> 03:00:11.888]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.649 --> 03:00:14.571]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.591 --> 03:00:17.894]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.414 --> 03:00:22.458]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.542 --> 03:00:29.446]  Yeah, I tried to sell versus the United States, Dr. Charles T. Sell.
[03:00:29.486 --> 03:00:30.687]  I had his lawyers and people on.
[03:00:30.707 --> 03:00:33.028]  They kept him in jail for years after years.
[03:00:34.249 --> 03:00:36.851]  He was charged with Medicaid or Medicare fraud.
[03:00:36.871 --> 03:00:39.433]  No, no, not charged.
[03:00:39.613 --> 03:00:40.294]  Arrested.
[03:00:40.834 --> 03:00:44.857]  And then they said, you're mentally ill for issuing a not guilty plea.
[03:00:45.718 --> 03:00:49.421]  We're going to put you in a prison and drug you with antipsychotics.
[03:00:49.481 --> 03:00:50.522]  This guy with no criminal record.
[03:00:51.877 --> 03:00:52.918]  And they just rotted him.
[03:00:55.279 --> 03:00:56.919]  I just remember all these victims.
[03:00:57.860 --> 03:01:07.924]  Now in this case, in a landmark decision, the United States Supreme Court imposed stringent limits on the right of a lower court to order the forcible administrative or anti-psychotic medication to a criminal defendant.
[03:01:08.945 --> 03:01:18.929]  So the Supreme Court did the right thing on that, at least partially, who had been determined to be incompetent to stand trial for the sole purpose of making them competent and be able to be tried.
[03:01:20.282 --> 03:01:25.143]  Well, they just found him incompetent because he said it was a conspiracy, and the government can't do a conspiracy against you.
[03:01:25.163 --> 03:01:25.903]  That's mentally ill.
[03:01:27.703 --> 03:01:32.564]  Specifically, the court held that lower courts could do so only under limited circumstances.
[03:01:32.604 --> 03:01:34.285]  See, it was one of those things where it was both ways.
[03:01:34.945 --> 03:01:36.825]  And a specified criteria had been met.
[03:01:37.985 --> 03:01:44.747]  And I forget even what happened in the case, but I think they just ignored the ruling last time.
[03:01:44.767 --> 03:01:46.147]  I wonder whatever happened to him.
[03:01:47.924 --> 03:01:49.825]  Subsequent developments.
[03:01:50.265 --> 03:01:54.006]  In 2004, Sell was found competent to stand trial and the trial was scheduled.
[03:01:54.026 --> 03:01:58.227]  A week before the trial began, the prosecution and defense claimed that he was mentally unfit for trial.
[03:01:58.648 --> 03:02:01.469]  They kept him in jail for like some huge amount of time drugged.
[03:02:02.009 --> 03:02:09.051]  On April 18th of 2005, Sell pleaded no contest to federal charges of fraud and conspiracy to kill a federal agent.
[03:02:09.331 --> 03:02:10.011]  Yeah, that was it.
[03:02:10.031 --> 03:02:11.332]  He was at a shooting range.
[03:02:11.992 --> 03:02:14.573]  And they had an undercover there and he talked crap about him.
[03:02:14.593 --> 03:02:19.434]  And they showed him after serving eight years without trial in federal prison.
[03:02:19.694 --> 03:02:25.755]  It's like that guy in New Mexico had been in jail for like three years being pulled over for a parking ticket or something.
[03:02:26.476 --> 03:02:27.636]  There wasn't even a record of him.
[03:02:27.656 --> 03:02:31.977]  He was like had long hair and fingernails and was like, and they just shoved food under it.
[03:02:32.517 --> 03:02:34.537]  I think they should have just shoved them all in a wood chipper.
[03:02:34.597 --> 03:02:36.778]  I say blow the whole planet up to worship government.
[03:02:36.998 --> 03:02:37.938]  Government's in charge!
[03:02:37.978 --> 03:02:39.379]  Detonate the antimatter weapons!
[03:02:39.419 --> 03:02:40.139]  We worship you!
[03:02:41.152 --> 03:02:43.094]  Just, you know, government is God.
[03:02:43.154 --> 03:02:43.774]  How's that sound?
[03:02:44.294 --> 03:02:44.955]  That sound good?
[03:02:44.975 --> 03:02:46.676]  Just worship government.
[03:02:46.816 --> 03:02:48.117]  Worship, worship, worship.
[03:02:48.638 --> 03:02:49.739]  All right, I apologize, folks.
[03:02:49.779 --> 03:02:50.960]  I'm a little out of control today.
[03:02:53.922 --> 03:02:55.723]  Dave in Texas, you're on the air, sir.
[03:02:55.783 --> 03:02:56.364]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:56.384 --> 03:02:57.785]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:02:57.845 --> 03:02:58.766]  Good to talk to you.
[03:02:59.546 --> 03:03:00.007]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:01.608 --> 03:03:06.652]  Yeah, I wanted to bring to your attention an event that happened to me earlier today.
[03:03:07.504 --> 03:03:13.970]  I went to pick up my four-year-old grandson at Pre-K at a, unfortunately, a government school.
[03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:16.191]  A four-year-old thought criminal?
[03:03:17.232 --> 03:03:17.873]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:18.113 --> 03:03:20.395]  And he had been written up.
[03:03:21.468 --> 03:03:22.789]  I got a note from his teacher.
[03:03:22.809 --> 03:03:27.414]  He had been written up for making a little gun sign with his hand at another student.
[03:03:27.454 --> 03:03:29.716]  He made a gun sign with his hand.
[03:03:30.036 --> 03:03:32.018]  They show it all over TV and everywhere.
[03:03:33.159 --> 03:03:35.341]  But the kids, all kids play with toy guns.
[03:03:35.641 --> 03:03:36.922]  He made the sign of his hand.
[03:03:37.142 --> 03:03:37.823]  He's four.
[03:03:38.283 --> 03:03:39.024]  What do we need to do?
[03:03:39.064 --> 03:03:39.685]  A lobotomy?
[03:03:42.627 --> 03:03:43.789]  His line disconnected.
[03:03:44.847 --> 03:03:46.147]  His cell phone dropped.
[03:03:46.408 --> 03:03:47.388]  I want to hear this story.
[03:03:47.868 --> 03:03:58.651]  Yeah, they're teaching everybody to be mentally ill basket cases where your pastry looks like a gun, you're kicked out of school, you brought a plastic knife to zero tolerance.
[03:03:58.671 --> 03:04:00.172]  Zero tolerance is a prison.
[03:04:00.532 --> 03:04:01.572]  The schools are prisons.
[03:04:01.632 --> 03:04:07.194]  And speaking of New Mexico and other states, now have the big private security firms that own the prisons.
[03:04:07.594 --> 03:04:13.636]  They're now doing security at the schools and admittedly prepping everyone for prison.
[03:04:15.353 --> 03:04:27.800]  And a lot of these states pass laws agreeing to keep the prisons at 90% occupancy to get new prisons built in the state, because that's the jobs in our state, is the prison.
[03:04:28.140 --> 03:04:31.482]  Only jobs around here at Walmart and at the prison.
[03:04:32.063 --> 03:04:39.347]  But see, make them criminals work in an un-air-conditioned prison, but then they work for 25 cents an hour taking your jobs.
[03:04:40.714 --> 03:04:44.377]  The good ol' boys go, oh, is that why I don't have a job?
[03:04:45.038 --> 03:04:45.378]  Yes.
[03:04:46.399 --> 03:04:51.404]  What's the Kurt Vonnegut book where half the people are in prison and the other half are jail guards?
[03:04:52.185 --> 03:04:53.926]  That's pretty much where this is going.
[03:04:54.987 --> 03:04:56.349]  How about we do something else?
[03:04:57.129 --> 03:04:58.030]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:58.090 --> 03:04:59.352]  Read Transmission starts now.
