[00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:02.590]  I'm here with Jerry Patterson, the next Lieutenant Governor.
[00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.811]  How are you doing, Mr. Patterson?
[00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:04.792]  I'm doing really well.
[00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:09.174]  So can you just explain to us the position of Lieutenant Governor and what you hope to achieve?
[00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:21.974]  Well, the Lieutenant Governor is arguably the most powerful position in Texas government, and I'm not seeking power, but I frankly think that we are on the cusp of going the wrong direction in Texas.
[00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:35.479]  And we need somebody who is not afraid, somebody who's straight, and I mean straight in the sense that I tell you what I think, and somebody who has specific things that he or she, in this case he, wishes to accomplish.
[00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.780]  And if you go to my website, VotePatterson.com,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:47.627]  Unlike all the other candidates, you're going to see a very detailed enumeration of things having to do with the Second Amendment, and I encourage folks to go and read what I say about that.
[00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:52.091]  Water, transportation, education, immigration.
[00:00:53.152 --> 00:01:00.938]  So I think folks are looking for leadership, and I think we have too many candidates who are more interested in looking good.
[00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.821]  Who are more interested in the next election than the next generation.
[00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.024]  And I'm only focused on doing what I think is right.
[00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:13.607]  Like some politicians and some office holders from the past in Texas.
[00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:15.329]  We have too few of them today.
[00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.432]  Recently we saw the issues with the people at the Texas Capitol building.
[00:01:19.772 --> 00:01:22.214]  And the people out there carrying the black-powdered pistols.
[00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:24.456]  And it's my understanding that you actually wrote that law.
[00:01:24.576 --> 00:01:29.140]  The definitions in Chapter 46-01, definitions in this chapter,
[00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:45.723]  The firearm does not include antique or curio firearm manufactured before 1899 or a replica of an antique or curio firearm manufactured before 1899, but only if the replica does not use rimfire or centerfire ammunition.
[00:01:46.143 --> 00:01:47.524]  And mine is a ball and cap.
[00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:59.933]  I was the author of the Texas Concealed Handgun Law in 1995, and one of the items of unfinished business was I wanted to make these cap-and-ball replica revolvers, not firearms, under the law.
[00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:09.040]  So, after I left the legislature, I wrote this statute, I gave it to a state rep and a state senator, they passed it, testified in favor of it, so I know the law very well.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.962]  And a cap and ball revolver that does not shoot center fire, rim fire ammunition, under the law, is not a firearm.
[00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:18.542]  And that's under state and federal law.
[00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:19.542]  So they had no firearm.
[00:02:20.903 --> 00:02:23.443]  And their arrest was unlawful.
[00:02:23.563 --> 00:02:29.745]  The law says you have to carry this firearm in a manner calculated to alarm.
[00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:33.546]  Now carrying a pistol in a holster is not calculated to alarm.
[00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:38.607]  And think about the interesting testimony that's going to be, I guess, at trial.
[00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:54.629]  When at the same time that we're arresting this guy for carrying an antique replica pistol that under the law is not a firearm, at the same time right there were citizens lawfully carrying ARs and AKs, sling arms, and they weren't arrested.
[00:02:55.029 --> 00:03:07.680]  So to the average bystander walking around, assuming that anybody was alarmed, and frankly they should not be, why would you arrest a guy with an antique pistol that's not even a firearm under federal or state law?
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.843]  But then it's okay with the AKs and the ARs.
[00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:12.865]  It should be okay with AKs and ARs.
[00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:14.206]  That is the law in Texas.
[00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:17.929]  Open carry of a long gun is not unlawful in Texas.
[00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:29.334]  What we have here is somebody, and I don't know, I doubt that it was the DPS officer, but somebody decided to make up law and say, I'm alarmed.
[00:03:29.994 --> 00:03:33.035]  You know, you have to have a reasonable standard to this.
[00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:35.236]  You can't just say, I'm alarmed.
[00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:37.757]  I mean, there are people who are easily alarmed.
[00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:38.717]  They don't make law either.
[00:03:38.757 --> 00:03:40.918]  Somebody has to have a reasonable standard.
[00:03:41.378 --> 00:03:43.539]  These gentlemen were arrested unlawfully.
[00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:44.780]  They broke no law.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.241]  And I'm anxious to see how this turns out at trial.
[00:03:48.951 --> 00:03:54.246]  Now one of the things I'm anxious to see is this rally we have coming up on October 19th where people are going to gather at the Alamo.
[00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.190]  This isn't about violating people's rights.
[00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.211]  It's not about gun control.
[00:03:57.231 --> 00:03:57.931]  It's not about politics.
[00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:58.831]  It's about the state law.
[00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.892]  If the firearm is carried in a manner calculated to cause alarm,
[00:04:22.188 --> 00:04:22.428]  I think?
[00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:45.009]  A DA in Harris County, Johnny Holmes, was adamantly opposed to it and wrote me a letter about three years after we passed it and says, I was wrong.
[00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:54.776]  So it's really refreshing to see some folks fess up when they're wrong, but San Antonio PD has a policy about open carry and they are not going to allow it.
[00:04:55.016 --> 00:04:59.720]  They have no authority to make up the law and that's what they're doing.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.023]  So I hope that San Antonio PD complies with the law.
[00:05:04.443 --> 00:05:09.567]  Now, as more and more people move here to Texas, we see Rick Perry campaigning to get people to come here to the state of Texas.
[00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:10.888]  Does this concern you at all?
[00:05:10.948 --> 00:05:13.390]  Because we have many people with many different ideologies.
[00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.271]  It does concern me.
[00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:18.835]  We have people moving here from foreign countries, like California, that I am concerned about.
[00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:25.280]  As long as they come to Texas, and they're coming here because they share our values, they share our belief in the Second Amendment,
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.381]  Which has nothing to do with hunting.
[00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:29.962]  It has nothing to do with recreational use.
[00:05:30.042 --> 00:05:31.563]  It has nothing to do with collecting.
[00:05:31.703 --> 00:05:43.929]  It has only to do with my God-given, constitutionally enumerated right to keep and bear arms to defend myself against a criminal element or an oppressive government.
[00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:45.410]  That's what it's about.
[00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:57.053]  And as long as they believe that way, as well as the other freedoms, and as long as they believe that we, you know, don't need any more government regulation, that we have too much government, and they're coming here for those reasons, then I'm fine with it.
[00:05:57.113 --> 00:05:58.154]  I don't care where they come from.
[00:05:58.174 --> 00:05:59.954]  And it's a good thing.
[00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:07.016]  People came to Texas in the 1830s and 1840s and 60s because they were seeking liberty and opportunity.
[00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:08.477]  Same thing today.
[00:06:08.837 --> 00:06:14.939]  But they, in my view, they need to, you know, understand our values may be different than the values where they came from.
[00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:17.517]  Are you an advocate for state nullification?
[00:06:18.057 --> 00:06:25.582]  You know, we have the ability under the Constitution to ignore whatever law is unconstitutional.
[00:06:25.622 --> 00:06:27.223]  Now, how do you make that determination?
[00:06:27.723 --> 00:06:38.370]  If the federal government were to pass a law and say, well, you know, you can no longer carry your firearm, or we're going to pass a law that says we're going to outlaw open carry of long guns, yeah, that would be unconstitutional law.
[00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.311]  And frankly, I don't know if nullification
[00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:41.992]  I just go with ignoring.
[00:06:42.352 --> 00:06:44.113]  As land commissioner, I travel quite a bit.
[00:06:44.574 --> 00:06:49.617]  I've spent quite a bit of time in the Big Bend National Park because we have some land adjacent to it.
[00:06:50.197 --> 00:06:53.119]  At one time, you could not carry in a national park.
[00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:54.820]  You couldn't possess a firearm.
[00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:55.661]  I ignored it.
[00:06:56.321 --> 00:06:58.423]  I told the San Antonio newspaper I ignored it.
[00:06:58.503 --> 00:07:00.744]  They wrote an editorial saying he ignores the law.
[00:07:00.824 --> 00:07:01.485]  I said, I'm sorry.
[00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:02.466]  That's not the law.
[00:07:02.626 --> 00:07:03.826]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:08.530]  When I go into border areas along the Texas border, I'm armed.
[00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.551]  And unless it's private property,
[00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:13.134]  As far as those unconstitutional laws, do you think that extends to the TSA?
[00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.410]  You know, I think it extends to the TSA in some circumstances.
[00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.971]  It depends on how the TSA conducts themselves.
[00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:38.393]  You know, cavity searches, of course we have some problems with cavity searches here in Texas with other law enforcement agencies, but it extends to how they conduct themselves.
[00:07:38.493 --> 00:07:39.213]  What do they do?
[00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:45.295]  And I would submit to you that sometimes they are infringing on the rights and the personal rights of privacy.
[00:07:45.795 --> 00:07:46.776]  Other times they are not.
[00:07:46.836 --> 00:07:50.897]  I don't think you can blanket, make a statement on that many TSA officers.
[00:07:51.357 --> 00:07:53.578]  I try not to fly commercial if I can help it.
[00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.159]  I got a little airplane, I fly it or I drive.
[00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:03.621]  Now we see the city of Chicago has now been deemed the murder capital of the United States of America even though it has some of the strictest gun laws.
[00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:06.202]  So let me ask you, how do you feel about gun-free zones?
[00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:09.868]  Well, they're a target-rich environment for the criminal element.
[00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.169]  I mean, I talk about this a great deal.
[00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.953]  I mean, I'm probably the guy that most people call when it comes to the Second Amendment and firearms.
[00:08:17.613 --> 00:08:24.157]  And I use the analogy, had I been in a theater in Aurora, Colorado, fewer people would have died.
[00:08:24.878 --> 00:08:26.058]  And that was a gun-free zone.
[00:08:26.178 --> 00:08:28.340]  It was private property and they had band carry.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.642]  And people, when I say that, they look at me and say, oh, that's impossible.
[00:08:31.702 --> 00:08:32.663]  I mean, that guy had a
[00:08:33.283 --> 00:08:36.728]  You know, he had an AR and he had body armor and all of that stuff.
[00:08:36.768 --> 00:08:50.025]  And I say, look, the first time someone had returned fire to that, in the direction of that shooter, the first time a round had gone off and it didn't come from the shooter, the dynamic would have changed.
[00:08:50.745 --> 00:08:52.686]  You don't have to bring him down to save lives.
[00:09:06.591 --> 00:09:06.931]  I think so.
[00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:34.224]  And, you know, when I passed the concealed handgun law, we had to put some gun-free zones to get the votes I needed.
[00:09:34.924 --> 00:09:39.946]  Over the years, we have eliminated and removed many of those gun-free locations.
[00:09:41.506 --> 00:09:45.868]  One of them, it's kind of funny, one of the locations that was prohibited initially was churches.
[00:09:46.428 --> 00:09:52.431]  Well, I believe that violates the separation, there is no separation, but it violates the church ability to do what they wish.
[00:09:53.291 --> 00:10:03.162]  You know, frankly, if you have a congregation that's packing, the sermons are much shorter and much more to the point.
[00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:06.505]  But we continue to eliminate gun-free zones.
[00:10:06.585 --> 00:10:08.608]  A gun-free zone is nothing more than an invitation.
[00:10:08.968 --> 00:10:15.215]  You have an A-plus rating from the NRA, so guns are definitely an important issue to you, but what else do the people of Texas need to know?
[00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:21.630]  Well, you know, I was the guy who, probably the three most significant items that I passed when I was in the Senate.
[00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.912]  I repealed the motorcycle helmet law.
[00:10:24.432 --> 00:10:25.854]  That's kind of a liberty thing.
[00:10:26.574 --> 00:10:29.297]  And, you know, I passed the concealed handgun law.
[00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:40.586]  I passed a constitutional amendment to allow citizens to access their home equity without government interference in telling them for what purpose they can access their home equity.
[00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:42.368]  So I'm kind of a pro-liberty guy.
[00:10:42.948 --> 00:10:54.175]  And I believe that government in its zeal to raise the floor and bring everybody up has to recognize that in doing so, in order to fund that, you also have to lower the ceiling.
[00:10:54.796 --> 00:10:57.898]  I want the opportunity in Texas to make a mistake.
[00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:11.688]  Because whether that's a financial mistake, you know, investing my money, because without that opportunity to take choices and take chances, then we also have the diminished opportunity to succeed.
[00:11:12.188 --> 00:11:13.229]  And I grew up in Texas.
[00:11:13.469 --> 00:11:14.450]  I went to school in the 50s.
[00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:17.071]  Everything was open to me.
[00:11:18.092 --> 00:11:21.213]  And today, you know, I have children, I have grandchildren.
[00:11:21.393 --> 00:11:23.333]  I want them to have those same opportunities.
[00:11:23.993 --> 00:11:39.298]  And I see an oppressive federal government that, with a do-gooder mentality, continues to pass statutes such as the Endangered Species Act, you know, a lot of other so-called well-intended items of legislation.
[00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:44.179]  That mindset is not here in Texas, and we should be thankful for that.
[00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:46.300]  But it's creeping this way.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.341]  And we have to, in my view, maintain Texas as it is and as it was.
[00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:57.503]  And not only is that good for Texas, Texas has the ability to lead and redeem this nation.
[00:11:57.923 --> 00:11:59.783]  Because we are liberty.
[00:12:00.123 --> 00:12:03.824]  And there are a few other states, but we're the prime state that can redeem this nation.
[00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:06.245]  Vote Patterson dot com.
[00:12:06.834 --> 00:12:08.465]  All right, Jerry Patterson, thank you for your time, sir.
[00:12:08.485 --> 00:12:09.612]  All right, thank you, Jakari.
[00:12:21.345 --> 00:12:25.608]  We take this business of waking people up very seriously here at InfoWars.
[00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:28.350]  That's why we have such a huge outreach operation.
[00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.233]  And it wouldn't be possible without the InfoWars magazine.
[00:12:32.593 --> 00:12:35.735]  And we have a very special October edition for you.
[00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:42.680]  We're gonna make it super easy for you to get interactive with your friends and family by giving you these lovely cutout masks.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.360]  Not one,
[00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:49.145]  But two very scary educational tools for you to hit the street.
[00:12:49.465 --> 00:12:51.546]  Join with the collective.
[00:12:51.586 --> 00:12:55.707]  Just go to sleep, and when you awaken, there'll be no more free will.
[00:12:55.727 --> 00:13:02.708]  And whatever you do, don't get a copy of October's SpecialInfoWars.com magazine.
[00:13:03.068 --> 00:13:04.949]  Whatever you do, don't resist.
[00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:06.489]  Give in.
[00:13:08.073 --> 00:13:16.461]  260,000 of you could be out there as Obamacare or Prozac, the killer clown.
[00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:17.882]  Hi kids!
[00:13:18.182 --> 00:13:21.786]  It's me, your favorite selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor!
[00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:30.374]  Just cut along the dotted lines, cut some holes for the eyes and attach a few rubber bands and you are ready to wake up America this Halloween.
[00:13:30.996 --> 00:13:36.040]  Remember kids, Obamacare is for you and your family, and so is Prozac and Ritalin.
[00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:43.827]  So whatever you do, don't secure your copy of InfoWars Magazine, and resist, because death is good for you.
[00:13:59.653 --> 00:14:02.394]  You can pick up your copy today at the InfoWars store.
[00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:09.016]  You can always buy these in bulk at cost, and for a limited time, the annual subscription is just $39.95.
[00:14:10.396 --> 00:14:13.077]  Call now because operators are standing by.
[00:14:13.197 --> 00:14:14.878]  Obama, where are you?
[00:14:14.998 --> 00:14:18.759]  Because people need to know that Obamacare is bone-chillingly frightening.
