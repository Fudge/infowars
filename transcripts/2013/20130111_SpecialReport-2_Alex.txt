[00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.221]  Reporting for InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Ortiz.
[00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:19.425]  If someone has been videotaped, it's usually easy to interpret what occurred on film.
[00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:24.029]  That's unless, of course, the person who was videotaped was an officer of the law.
[00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:29.132]  Meet Deputy Daniel Malukes of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
[00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:39.320]  In January 2012, the officer and his partner responded to a call that claimed a woman had attempted to punch a bus passenger in Bellflower, California.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.585]  The woman who witnesses claimed was clearly mentally disabled, was grabbed by the officers and as a result began shouting.
[00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:54.471]  Rather than asking the woman to sit down or forcefully making her sit down, Deputy Malukes decided to elbow her in the face.
[00:00:55.211 --> 00:01:00.295]  An action that witnessed Jeremy Green, a former military veteran, thought was completely abusive.
[00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:03.177]  I think you have some balls.
[00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:03.537]  Really?
[00:01:03.577 --> 00:01:04.978]  What's he broke?
[00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.819]  Yeah?
[00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:06.299]  Really?
[00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:13.337]  And you can tell it's very obvious that she was a special, you know, has special needs.
[00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:16.882]  In the Army they gave us extensive training for rules of engagement.
[00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:19.987]  There's proper protocols and different steps you take.
[00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:25.315]  This lady didn't do anything, she was not combative, and he actually turned combative on her.
[00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:38.007]  Despite this clear abuse, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office claims that Deputy Maluks displayed, quote, a high level of professionalism and used a minimal amount of force, end quote.
[00:01:38.728 --> 00:01:44.254]  And if that wasn't offensive enough, it turns out Officer Daniel Maluks, who was still on the force,
[00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:47.556]  Has been involved in two other lawsuits in recent years.
[00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:58.142]  One in which he and another officer were ordered to pay an estimated half a million dollars for racially profiling an individual by the name of Adam Allered.
[00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:08.169]  And a still pending case where officer Malukes and other officers allegedly shot and killed an unarmed 23 year old by the name of Dexter Luckett.
[00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.452]  If you would like to see the bus case reopen, reach out to L.A.
[00:02:12.512 --> 00:02:18.757]  County District Attorney, Jackie Lacey, and express your concerns over case number 321-973-28.
[00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:23.941]  Now, let's take a look at another bad cop.
[00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:26.844]  Meet Officer Jesse Zilge of the St.
[00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:28.445]  Paul, Minnesota Police Department.
[00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:36.791]  In August of 2012, he came into contact with Eric Hightower, an individual who had allegedly been making violent threats to his girlfriend.
[00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:45.298]  While Mr. Hightower was laying down on the ground, Officer Zilge took it upon himself to really subdue him by, well, kicking him in the face.
[00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:53.724]  Hightower, who was clearly hurt and angered by the brazen attack, was then maced and shoved into a car by several police officers.
[00:02:54.724 --> 00:03:03.671]  Recently, Olmstead County Attorney Mark Ostrom shockingly ruled that there was insufficient proof the officer used unreasonable force.
[00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.273]  If you would like to see this case appealed, reach out to the Minnesota State Attorney General's office.
[00:03:09.874 --> 00:03:13.797]  It's important to note that there are some officers that condemn their actions.
[00:03:14.337 --> 00:03:20.582]  Individuals such as retired New York City police detectives Graham Weatherspoon and Carlton Berkeley.
[00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:30.890]  Two individuals whose organization, Police Reform Organizing Project, is trying to make the public aware that police abuse is rampant and needs to stop.
[00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.932]  Under the guise of protecting people,
[00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:37.264]  People's rights are being violated.
[00:03:38.024 --> 00:03:43.406]  That's why stop-and-frisk has gotten so big, under the guise of stopping crime.
[00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.927]  They're not stopping crime, they're committing crimes.
[00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:51.109]  If the police officer down there is talking to you, I don't see why you can't cut your phone on, right?
[00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.051]  Film and audio tape the whole encounter.
[00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:58.973]  Also, if there's other people standing around, they should do the same thing.
[00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:01.694]  And if you do that, it will hold up in court.
[00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:09.245]  And here's one more hero cop by the name of Deputy Sheriff Stan Lenick of the Albany County Sheriff's Department.
[00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:20.317]  In November of 2012, two InfoWars activists, named Jason Burmiss and Ashley Jessica, were visiting the Albany International Airport to hand out anti-TSA flyers.
[00:04:20.858 --> 00:04:30.684]  While at the airport, they were harassed by the airport PR director, Doug Myers, who demanded they show him their ID, despite the fact they were filming on public property.
[00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:36.148]  That's when Deputy Sheriff Lennick jumped into action and protected their First Amendment rights.
[00:04:36.502 --> 00:04:37.923]  We don't know who you are.
[00:04:37.983 --> 00:04:38.944]  I told you who I am.
[00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:39.745]  I am Jason Burmess.
[00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:40.886]  Let me see your identification.
[00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:42.587]  I don't need to show you my identification.
[00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:44.109]  He doesn't have to show you his identification.
[00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:45.970]  I'll tell you who I am.
[00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.631]  I want his name.
[00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:48.052]  I just told you my name.
[00:04:48.232 --> 00:04:49.854]  My name is Jason Burmess.
[00:04:50.254 --> 00:04:51.635]  B-E-R-M-S-S-E-R.
[00:04:51.815 --> 00:04:52.616]  I can't give you that.
[00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:53.317]  I can't give you that.
[00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:59.981]  To those last few officers, we salute you.
[00:05:00.683 --> 00:05:03.247]  Well, that's all for this edition of Bad Cop, Good Cop.
[00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:09.739]  I'm David Ortiz, reminding you that we are not against the law enforcement community, just law enforcement abuse.
