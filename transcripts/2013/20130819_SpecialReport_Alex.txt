[00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:12.086]  Hey, my name is Pete Ayer.
[00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:15.068]  I'm one of the many folks involved with the DecentralizedCopBlock.org.
[00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:17.249]  I couldn't miss the Peaceful Street Summit.
[00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:23.391]  I was out here last year and myself, my buddy Jacob Crawford, who's a longtime cop watcher, we've been collaborating in the past.
[00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:24.252]  We've been brainstorming.
[00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:27.053]  We decided to hit the road, do a tour called the Police Accountability Tour.
[00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:29.734]  So we decided to make Austin the first stop on that tour.
[00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:36.577]  And because of the summit, there's a lot of awesome doers here we can learn from, and we look forward to, you know, taking some of that message and spreading it with others.
[00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.098]  My name is Carlos Miller.
[00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:46.022]  I run the blog PhotographiesNotACrime.com and I write about the right to record in public, specifically police officers, to keep them accountable.
[00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:47.523]  They're recording us and we record them.
[00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:48.744]  We have the right to record them.
[00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:52.526]  Except, many times, as I've learned personally, as many people have learned,
[00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:54.487]  They don't recognize our right.
[00:00:54.527 --> 00:00:55.607]  I've been arrested three times.
[00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:56.808]  I've been acquitted three times.
[00:00:57.528 --> 00:00:59.349]  And, you know, so I really encourage that.
[00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:09.094]  I document people's experiences, people's arrests from around the country who get arrested for taking pictures, just to kind of keep a clearinghouse on my blog of all these incidents.
[00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:16.057]  And I try to do these stories and educate people, hopefully educate police officers as well, because they do need a lot of educating.
[00:01:17.237 --> 00:01:19.238]  And just to let them know that we're not going to stop.
[00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:26.939]  They may have the guns, they may have the badges, they may have the authority and the power, they may even have the judges and the courts in their pockets, but we have the numbers.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.400]  I'm with Veterans Against Police Abuse.
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.702]  The military and the police force should be entirely different entities.
[00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:40.703]  They should not overlap in anything and the militarization of
[00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:48.602]  Police, the escalation of force there just means that actual criminals will escalate their own force.
[00:01:48.882 --> 00:01:51.528]  The second annual Peaceful Street Summit, how do you feel about this?
[00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:52.802]  I'm pretty excited.
[00:01:52.842 --> 00:02:00.404]  It's been a lot of hard work, a lot of difficulty trying to figure out logistics because our previous venue canceled on us.
[00:02:00.904 --> 00:02:05.485]  Fundraising has been challenging, bringing people in from all over the country, but it's worth it.
[00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:12.387]  You just look around, all these amazing people, different parts of society, socioeconomically, politically, racially.
[00:02:12.607 --> 00:02:15.048]  It's great to see all these people coming together to fight police abuse.
[00:02:15.548 --> 00:02:20.809]  Stop by the InfoWars shop and pick up Breakthrough, James O'Keefe's guide to guerrilla journalism.
