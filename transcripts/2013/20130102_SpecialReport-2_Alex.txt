[00:00:09.565 --> 00:00:11.846]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:18.988]  The National Institute of Mental Health has stated that one in four adults will suffer from a diagnosable mental health disorder each year.
[00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:26.730]  Now keep this in mind, the DSM-5, an APA publication, has stated that nearly every human emotion is a mental disorder.
[00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.631]  Everything from excitement to sadness, which is to say, you're crazy too.
[00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.513]  Let's start with this scene.
[00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.935]  A SWAT team in an armored vehicle.
[00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:40.799]  Surely there must have been some wicked Al Qaeda members inside that home cooking meth.
[00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.762]  No, it was a mother who refused to force vaccinate her child.
[00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:49.025]  The mother stated that the medications changed the child's behavior for the worse.
[00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:52.588]  A SWAT team was called after a shot was allegedly fired.
[00:00:53.088 --> 00:00:58.673]  No rounds were recovered and the criminal charges were eventually dropped, but the child was still taken into custody.
[00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:07.282]  For more insight on parent-child mental health, let's take a look at this LA Times article, where it links spanking your child to giving them a mental illness.
[00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:08.503]  And the U.S.
[00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:14.310]  should be able to catch such anomalies quickly, as states like Texas give mental health screenings to three-year-olds.
[00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:29.461]  Beyond what we've already listed, some people think more things should be added to the category of mental illness, such as... This is out of the American Psychiatric Association, APA, which is called the Bible for Mental Health Medicine.
[00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:34.565]  And this is precisely what the Soviets used to send dissidents to Siberian gulags.
[00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:37.807]  Oppositional Defiant Disorder.
[00:01:38.128 --> 00:01:42.311]  That equates to distrusting or rebelling against authority.
[00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:45.035]  Also, those who are critical of climate change.
[00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:51.506]  You know, the climate change that was global cooling, then it was global warming, and now it's any type of weather shift.
[00:01:52.279 --> 00:02:02.242]  One young man believed in climate change so passionately that he actually gave himself a mental disorder as he refused to drink water in fear that the planet would dehydrate as a result.
[00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:08.084]  But you say, why would those in medicine purposely diagnose healthy people with mental disorders?
[00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:13.726]  Now, it could be general incompetence on the hands of the prescriber, or it could be that they're getting a kickback.
[00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:19.688]  As this article points out, upwards of 70% of psychiatrists are on drug companies' payrolls.
[00:02:20.388 --> 00:02:26.936]  Keep these things in mind as politicians clamor for, quote, mental health screenings for owning private properties such as firearms.
