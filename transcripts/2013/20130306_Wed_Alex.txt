[00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:10.388]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:11.828]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:13.589]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.710]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:22.432]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.188 --> 00:00:29.489]  Welcome to the broadcast!
[00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.231]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:37.776]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, sitting in for Alex today on this Wednesday, March 6th, 2013.
[00:00:38.377 --> 00:00:42.160]  Yes, Hugo Chavez is dead.
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.643]  At least his physical body is dead.
[00:00:45.723 --> 00:00:50.187]  His soul is no doubt rotting someplace where he's inhaling a lot of sulfur right now.
[00:00:51.048 --> 00:00:53.550]  And we're going to be talking about that on the show today, of course.
[00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:57.073]  Plus, we're hoping to get Max here in the studio.
[00:00:57.093 --> 00:01:05.940]  He's an InfoWars employee from Venezuela to give us some, you know, really well-informed perspective on the death of Chavez.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.046]  And I know in America everybody says Chavez, but in South America it's Chavez, so that's the pronunciation I'm going with.
[00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:21.012]  But anyway, there are a lot of implications for this and there are a lot of parallels to what is happening in America today.
[00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:26.115]  Parallel to what Chavez did to Venezuela since, what, 1998.
[00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:41.486]  So we're going to talk about those parallels and how the American economy is, has been invaded with a cancer in the same way that Chavez, his body was invaded with cancer and how socialism is a cancer.
[00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:45.807]  And in addition to that, we've got a lot of great guests coming up today.
[00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:51.468]  Now, the guest segments are going to be relatively short, because we've got so much news coming in.
[00:01:51.808 --> 00:02:00.990]  And in the third hour, we've got two special reports and some interesting dialogue with InfoWarriors David Knight and Aaron Dykes, who will be in studio with me here.
[00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.011]  That's the third hour.
[00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:06.812]  Before that, we've got Liz Reitzig with an update on the Raw Milk
[00:02:07.352 --> 00:02:09.334]  Public debate in Maryland.
[00:02:09.454 --> 00:02:11.757]  Just a quick update from her at the bottom of this hour.
[00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:19.125]  We've got James Stewart popping in with a success story of victory, entrepreneurial victory versus state tyranny.
[00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:26.393]  He is the raw milk man from California that they threw in jail for selling fresh milk
[00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:35.282]  We're actually not even selling it, just distributing it at a pickup point in Los Angeles and he has found a way to achieve victory against that tyranny.
[00:02:35.302 --> 00:02:37.744]  We'll have him on at the top of the next hour.
[00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:50.076]  We've also got Dr. Len Saputo joining us for some updates about vaccine damage of babies and why the system wants you to inject your children with mercury formaldehyde
[00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:52.958]  MSG and aluminum.
[00:02:53.158 --> 00:02:56.240]  It's all in vaccines admitted by the CDC.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.061]  So all of that news coming up today.
[00:02:58.181 --> 00:03:00.342]  Plus, check this out.
[00:03:00.422 --> 00:03:01.363]  This is huge news.
[00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:03.584]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:03:03.644 --> 00:03:06.666]  Story up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:12.289]  Media portrays DHS ammo purchases as a conspiracy theory.
[00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:13.269]  Yeah!
[00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:18.332]  No, the DHS isn't buying 1.6 billion rounds of ammo.
[00:03:18.352 --> 00:03:19.753]  Or I think it's up to 2 billion now.
[00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:29.715]  No, no, DHS isn't buying 7,000 full-auto assault rifles, as we already wrote about and exposed from their public bids.
[00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:41.217]  And no, according to Media Matters, DHS isn't even buying 2,700-plus armored assault vehicles to be deployed on the streets of America.
[00:03:41.557 --> 00:03:44.278]  No, this is all just imaginary.
[00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:46.219]  It's all imaginary!
[00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.439]  There are no bullets!
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.920]  There are no guns!
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.561]  There are no assault vehicles!
[00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:53.923]  It's just purely a conspiracy theory!
[00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:56.284]  It's just your imagination!
[00:03:56.304 --> 00:03:58.045]  And I'm relieved!
[00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:12.272]  I'm relieved, because it means that we can all just buy imaginary bulletproof vests now, to be safe, so that all those on the radical left out there who think this is imaginary, when the bullets start flying your way,
[00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:15.753]  All you need is an imaginary ballistic vest.
[00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:16.614]  It will protect you.
[00:04:17.234 --> 00:04:17.894]  That's right.
[00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:25.178]  And when they round you up and throw you in the imaginary FEMA camp, you can imagine that you're somewhere else.
[00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:30.721]  You can imagine you're in an Obama-mania utopia.
[00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:31.841]  How's that sound?
[00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:33.562]  Use your imagination.
[00:04:33.942 --> 00:04:34.783]  That's what it's there for.
[00:04:37.384 --> 00:04:46.932]  Hey, I'm gonna sell an imaginary preparedness course for the radical left so that you can imagine that you're prepared, but not really.
[00:04:47.372 --> 00:04:47.973]  How's that sound?
[00:04:48.073 --> 00:04:49.795]  Imaginary preparedness course.
[00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:53.658]  Much more news straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:53.978 --> 00:04:55.880]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with all this news and more.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.061]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:05:03.321 --> 00:05:06.843]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:05:06.963 --> 00:05:11.386]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:17.510]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:28.396]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:05:28.616 --> 00:05:34.923]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off of promo code water.
[00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:49.258]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride fillers.
[00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:57.714]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filter today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:14.983]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[00:06:41.946 --> 00:06:43.567]  This is an amazing deal.
[00:06:43.927 --> 00:06:48.491]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.

[00:07:00.894 --> 00:07:07.878]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:07:08.118 --> 00:07:25.748]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:30.110]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.951]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:39.997]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:07:40.317 --> 00:07:46.421]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:47.682]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:07:47.922 --> 00:07:48.642]  It's incredible.
[00:07:48.782 --> 00:07:57.828]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:07:58.009 --> 00:07:59.830]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:12.759]  Big Brother.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.521]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.002]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:16.943 --> 00:08:18.424]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:08:18.644 --> 00:08:19.825]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:20.305 --> 00:08:25.049]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:28.446]  All right, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:28.546 --> 00:08:29.767]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:34.390]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex, who has the week off.
[00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.132]  But he's calling all of us and filling us in and filming videos.
[00:08:39.152 --> 00:08:46.637]  In fact, he shot a video last night on the death of Hugo Chavez, and that's up at Infowars.com, so check out that video.
[00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:47.938]  Obviously, we're going to be covering
[00:08:48.618 --> 00:08:50.059]  The death of Chavez here today.
[00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:53.383]  So if you're interested in that, stay tuned.
[00:08:53.403 --> 00:08:55.785]  We're going to try to get Max in the studio here.
[00:08:55.825 --> 00:09:03.252]  Max is an InfoWars employee who is from Venezuela to get some in-depth perspective on that issue.
[00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:13.362]  But as I wrote last night, Hugo Chavez, even though he is dead, the great cancer of socialism continues to spread.
[00:09:14.022 --> 00:09:16.443]  So this is the really sad thing.
[00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:18.383]  Not that Chavez is dead.
[00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:26.546]  That's probably something worthy of a celebration for all who believe in human rights and liberties and justice in Venezuela.
[00:09:27.026 --> 00:09:32.528]  The real issue is that his philosophies continue to spread like a cancer tumor.
[00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:36.629]  And his philosophies, which are of course centralized control,
[00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:45.393]  Total government corruption, government taking over private industry, no more private ownership of businesses, all of this.
[00:09:45.933 --> 00:09:50.915]  Incredible corruption, incredible poverty, incredible centralized command-control economy.
[00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:54.577]  That philosophy is now invading America.
[00:09:54.617 --> 00:09:56.838]  Well, it has been for many years.
[00:09:57.198 --> 00:10:04.121]  We'll talk about that in more detail here on the show, but let me give you the rundown of what's coming up here for the next three hours here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:09.828]  We've got Liz Reitzig popping in for a few minutes with an update, a live update.
[00:10:09.908 --> 00:10:15.452]  She's about to give testimony in the state of Maryland on raw milk freedom, food freedom issue there.
[00:10:15.753 --> 00:10:17.534]  She's going to give us a quick update of what's happening.
[00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:25.480]  We've got James Stewart popping in from California on his entrepreneurial victory against the state tyranny there.
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.121]  They tried to shut him down for selling farm fresh milk.
[00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:34.204]  Now, this whole show isn't about food, by the way, but those two just happen to coincide today.
[00:10:34.404 --> 00:10:51.211]  We've got Dr. Len Saputo joining us to talk about GMOs and vaccine-damaged babies and how the system wants you to keep injecting your babies with lobotomizing heavy metals, including mercury, and of course, there's also MSG and formaldehyde in those vaccines.
[00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:57.594]  And then, in the third hour, sort of the bonus round here on the show, we've got David Knight joining us at one o'clock.
[00:10:58.214 --> 00:11:02.217]  With some special reports and also Aaron Dykes jumping in at 1.30.
[00:11:03.017 --> 00:11:04.658]  So it's a it's a packed show.
[00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:10.002]  I'm going to try to take some calls during the Len Saputo's segment.
[00:11:10.122 --> 00:11:12.043]  That's at at 12.30 central.
[00:11:12.063 --> 00:11:15.085]  So I'll open up the phones at that point for some calls.
[00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:17.807]  But until then we're just going to run down the breaking news now.
[00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:26.479]  We're waiting on Max to get in here to give us a breakdown on Chavez, so I'm going to save the Hugo Chavez story for later.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.663]  Let's go to this story right now, which I mentioned before the break, but not all stations carry that.
[00:11:32.183 --> 00:11:36.426]  Paul Joseph Watson has a blockbuster news story on Infowars.com.
[00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:41.229]  Media portrays DHS ammo purchases as conspiracy theory.
[00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:47.534]  This is, of course, from Media Matters, which is just, you know, an Obama administration mouthpiece.
[00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:49.755]  Now, here's the deal.
[00:11:49.935 --> 00:11:57.641]  If you're a regular listener of this show, you know that the federal government has purchased over 1.6 billion rounds of ammo.
[00:11:58.141 --> 00:11:59.982]  They're stockpiling ammo like never before.
[00:12:00.022 --> 00:12:00.863]  It's an arms race.
[00:12:01.723 --> 00:12:04.185]  It's actually up to 2 billion, if you're keeping track.
[00:12:04.786 --> 00:12:11.810]  And we've shown you the documents from the bid contracts with the actual numbers.
[00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:13.332]  Right there.
[00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:15.213]  It's all out in the open.
[00:12:15.613 --> 00:12:21.458]  We've shown you that DHS is purchasing 7,000 full auto assault rifles as well.
[00:12:22.138 --> 00:12:24.280]  And it calls them personal defense weapons, by the way.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.241]  That's interesting.
[00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:33.146]  We've shown you, and more recently, that DHS is retrofitting 2,700 armored vehicles.
[00:12:33.447 --> 00:12:35.428]  These are really armored assault vehicles.
[00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:39.851]  They're not tanks, because they don't have a turret, but they're armored
[00:12:40.652 --> 00:12:47.819]  You know, vehicles for moving assault teams around, and they are to be deployed in the United States on the streets of America.
[00:12:48.159 --> 00:13:00.130]  Now, the liberal media, well I guess liberal is even the wrong word, it's the radical left media, the White House controlled media, says that all of this is made up.
[00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.973]  That it's a complete conspiracy theory.
[00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.915]  The Associated Press even did a story on this.
[00:13:05.575 --> 00:13:12.798]  Which just said that the bullet buys are a conspiracy or that it's misleading and they don't give any reason why.
[00:13:12.818 --> 00:13:17.339]  Or they say, well, yeah, they're buying the bullets, but the government just wants to save money.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.321]  You don't save money buying things that you don't need, okay?
[00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:24.682]  So if they're buying all of this, they intend to use it.
[00:13:25.362 --> 00:13:26.364]  There's a lot of ammo.
[00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:29.050]  1.6 billion rounds, or 2 billion now.
[00:13:30.092 --> 00:13:31.174]  Thousands of assault rifles.
[00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:32.898]  Thousands of assault vehicles.
[00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:34.441]  And this is just the stuff we know about.
[00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.024]  Imagine the stuff that we don't know about.
[00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:39.016]  But the left says this is all imaginary.
[00:13:39.056 --> 00:13:48.779]  So, as I was joking before the break there, you know, wow, that makes our job very simple, very easy to prepare, since I guess all of this is imaginary.
[00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:55.421]  We could just, to defend against, you know, imaginary tyranny, we could just buy imaginary ballistic vests.
[00:13:56.061 --> 00:13:56.702]  Wouldn't that be great?
[00:13:56.982 --> 00:14:00.784]  Or, if you want to grow your own food, you could buy imaginary seeds.
[00:14:01.725 --> 00:14:05.248]  Or how about imaginary food for your food preparedness?
[00:14:05.868 --> 00:14:11.772]  And I was even thinking, I should produce a How to Imagine You're Prepared course.
[00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:12.613]  How about that?
[00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:16.235]  How to imagine that you're prepared for anything.
[00:14:17.076 --> 00:14:21.559]  And it doesn't cost you a dime to gather all this stuff because it's all imaginary.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:35.991]  And so when the government breaks out its imaginary ammo and its imaginary guns and comes into your town, rolls in with its imaginary assault vehicles, you can whip out your imaginary defenses and you can grow food with your imaginary seeds and
[00:14:36.511 --> 00:14:39.537]  And after you take the course, if a friend asks you, are you prepared?
[00:14:39.777 --> 00:14:41.260]  You can say, I imagine I am.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.542]  Yes, yes indeed.
[00:14:42.582 --> 00:14:46.208]  I imagine I am fully prepared against all the imaginary stuff.
[00:14:46.589 --> 00:14:48.813]  But obviously, this is all very real.
[00:14:50.027 --> 00:14:50.808]  Hardware is real.
[00:14:50.868 --> 00:14:52.329]  Bullets are real.
[00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:54.310]  Lead, you know, I checked.
[00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.291]  Lead is on the table of elements.
[00:14:56.511 --> 00:14:58.112]  It's actually an element.
[00:14:58.212 --> 00:15:01.814]  It's as physical as it gets in this reality.
[00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:09.239]  So, in fact, lead is quite dense and if it's headed your way, you don't want to just imagine that you're moving out of the way.
[00:15:09.259 --> 00:15:10.260]  You want to get out of the way.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.240]  You want to get prepared.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:18.325]  So, to all of those on the left who are lying to you and saying that this is all imaginary
[00:15:19.065 --> 00:15:26.067]  I can only say, I hope your imagination continues to work when the bullets are aimed at you.
[00:15:26.867 --> 00:15:27.167]  You know?
[00:15:27.907 --> 00:15:29.648]  Because that's where this is all headed.
[00:15:29.948 --> 00:15:46.673]  And we'll talk about Chavez, and we'll talk about Stalin, and Mao, and Hitler, and the history of tyrants throughout human history who have always inevitably tried to control power and try to dominate their people using weapons, weapons that are very real, hardware that is very real.
[00:15:46.973 --> 00:15:48.213]  It is not imaginary.
[00:15:48.673 --> 00:15:49.874]  It is not delusional.
[00:15:50.154 --> 00:15:51.694]  It is not a conspiracy theory.
[00:15:51.994 --> 00:15:54.075]  This is human history repeating itself.
[00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:56.636]  Why is the government arming up?
[00:15:57.836 --> 00:16:06.580]  It's not my imagination to tell you it's because the government anticipates needing to deploy that hardware on the streets of America.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.100]  There you go.
[00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:13.542]  God forbid the Associated Press actually would tell the truth and say such a thing.
[00:16:14.102 --> 00:16:17.064]  Anyway, check out that story on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:17.104 --> 00:16:17.904]  Let's go to some other news.
[00:16:19.151 --> 00:16:19.592]  I don't think so.
[00:16:37.149 --> 00:16:41.172]  And, let's see, what, uh, I'm not catching what state he is from.
[00:16:41.232 --> 00:16:41.813]  Oh, Montana.
[00:16:41.853 --> 00:16:42.133]  Here it is.
[00:16:42.193 --> 00:16:54.563]  Montana lawmaker Creighton Kearns warns that when he's trying to pass a bill that would prevent a health care provider from refusing service to a person who refuses to provide information about their firearms ownership.
[00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:56.024]  Because this is where this is headed.
[00:16:56.524 --> 00:17:06.392]  Someday in the future, you go into the hospital, you need treatment, you had an accident, a car accident, a broken bone, an infection, whatever, and they say, oh yeah, we'll treat ya.
[00:17:07.132 --> 00:17:09.254]  But, uh, you gotta turn in your Ruger.
[00:17:09.815 --> 00:17:11.337]  You gotta turn in your Remington.
[00:17:11.837 --> 00:17:12.918]  You gotta bring your bullets.
[00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:22.548]  And at that point, I guess you could tell them, you could just hand over empty air and say, here's my imaginary bullets, cause that's just like Department of Homeland Security, it's all imaginary.
[00:17:22.568 --> 00:17:25.190]  Um, all my guns are imaginary, so here they are.
[00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:34.555]  And they can then, in turn, give you imaginary health care, which is really what the whole system is, because it's not health care, it's disease management.
[00:17:35.015 --> 00:17:43.459]  They give you pharmaceuticals, and they get you to think, to imagine that you're getting a treatment, when in fact, you're just being poisoned by the pharmaceuticals.
[00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:49.161]  Think about it, vaccines are imaginary vaccines, because they don't protect you from the flu.
[00:17:49.341 --> 00:17:52.663]  In fact, I've got another story here today about how vaccines cause narcolepsy.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.422]  Vaccines are imaginary medicine.
[00:17:56.542 --> 00:18:02.647]  It's even more fringe than the skeptics say homeopathy is.
[00:18:03.007 --> 00:18:03.708]  It's so bizarre.
[00:18:04.148 --> 00:18:04.809]  Anyway, there you go.
[00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:07.431]  If you want healthcare, you might be required to turn in your guns.
[00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:08.332]  Check this out.
[00:18:09.112 --> 00:18:09.673]  Eric Holder.
[00:18:10.353 --> 00:18:12.657]  Drone strikes against Americans on U.S.
[00:18:12.697 --> 00:18:14.259]  soil are legal, he says.
[00:18:14.499 --> 00:18:19.426]  This is in response to a query from Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, of course.
[00:18:20.127 --> 00:18:26.216]  And in his letter answering Senator Paul, Eric Holder says that he thinks it's completely legal.
[00:18:26.977 --> 00:18:30.518]  To have drone strikes against American citizens on U.S.
[00:18:30.618 --> 00:18:31.098]  soil.
[00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:33.539]  And here's his language.
[00:18:34.099 --> 00:18:39.261]  He says, it is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance.
[00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:40.542]  Here he is imagining again.
[00:18:40.562 --> 00:18:43.443]  They really love all this imagining, don't they?
[00:18:43.743 --> 00:18:50.805]  To imagine a circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution, he says.
[00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:51.565]  What a joke.
[00:18:51.726 --> 00:18:52.506]  Under the Constitution?
[00:18:53.459 --> 00:18:53.699]  I think?
[00:19:08.453 --> 00:19:12.774]  Implications or statements in this statement from Eric Holder?
[00:19:13.214 --> 00:19:20.837]  I mean, this is grounds for being arrested for sedition against America.
[00:19:21.017 --> 00:19:24.238]  I mean, you can't use the military in the United States.
[00:19:24.518 --> 00:19:28.019]  The President alone cannot declare who to assassinate.
[00:19:29.414 --> 00:19:30.715]  This is not under the Constitution.
[00:19:30.735 --> 00:19:33.518]  I mean, this guy is off his rocker!
[00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:39.665]  But he says, he insists that you can use drone strikes against American citizens on U.S.
[00:19:39.705 --> 00:19:39.965]  soil.
[00:19:39.985 --> 00:19:41.127]  That is now official.
[00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:51.057]  So all of those who made fun of Alex Jones, saying they're going to use drones to come after you in America, all of you Media Matters and people out there, you owe Alex Jones an apology!
[00:19:51.718 --> 00:19:53.980]  Eric Holder just said Alex Jones was right!
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:54.881]  All right?
[00:19:55.001 --> 00:19:56.142]  That's a fact.
[00:19:56.482 --> 00:19:57.643]  It's not my imagination.
[00:19:57.683 --> 00:19:58.284]  That's a fact.
[00:19:58.344 --> 00:19:58.724]  Stay with us.
[00:19:58.744 --> 00:19:59.465]  We'll be right back.

[00:21:06.128 --> 00:21:09.692]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[00:21:10.452 --> 00:21:12.374]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[00:21:12.635 --> 00:21:22.325]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs
[00:21:22.705 --> 00:21:23.085]  I think?

[00:22:30.794 --> 00:22:31.855]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:32.035 --> 00:22:36.338]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:36.518 --> 00:22:42.143]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:42.243 --> 00:22:45.585]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:45.825 --> 00:22:48.387]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:23:21.129 --> 00:23:22.150]  Then there's affordability.

[00:24:11.858 --> 00:24:21.160]  Thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.141]  This is Mike Adams filling in today for Alex.
[00:24:25.181 --> 00:24:26.701]  Thank you for continuing with us.
[00:24:26.801 --> 00:24:28.201]  Much more straight ahead.
[00:24:28.221 --> 00:24:38.643]  I just can't believe that we live in a country where the Attorney General, who is supposed to be the person who upholds the law, the top
[00:24:39.827 --> 00:24:49.816]  law defender of the country says that the government, that one man, the president, can decide to kill
[00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:54.793]  An unlimited number of American people on U.S.
[00:24:55.013 --> 00:25:07.039]  soil with no due process, no charges ever being levied against you, no rights, no attorney, not even a trial by jury, man.
[00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:10.720]  I mean, it's, you talk about, wow, you talk about tyranny.
[00:25:11.321 --> 00:25:13.382]  This is the very definition of it.
[00:25:14.358 --> 00:25:20.002]  That the Attorney General would say, yeah, we can kill anybody at any time for any reason and we don't need to tell you why.
[00:25:20.283 --> 00:25:22.204]  We don't need to produce any evidence why.
[00:25:22.224 --> 00:25:25.446]  Is that not the definition of tyranny?
[00:25:25.506 --> 00:25:28.529]  Is that not a total criminal violation of the U.S.
[00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:29.229]  Constitution?
[00:25:29.529 --> 00:25:31.811]  Is that not government gone completely awry?
[00:25:31.831 --> 00:25:33.152]  I mean, come on.
[00:25:33.572 --> 00:25:34.613]  Come on, wake up people.
[00:25:35.094 --> 00:25:36.995]  Wake up and smell the tyranny.
[00:25:38.176 --> 00:25:40.217]  In some other news, some good news for a change.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.040]  Check this out.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.822]  Military acupuncture is a big deal.
[00:25:45.882 --> 00:25:50.143]  Many of you have probably never heard of this, but I've been tracking this because, of course, you know, I'm the health ranger.
[00:25:50.163 --> 00:25:52.024]  I follow alternative health.
[00:25:53.764 --> 00:26:09.470]  Acupuncture, you know how our soldiers are being killed by all of these SSRIs and all these psychotropic drugs and they're committing suicide in huge numbers and their brains are being fried by these drugs and then they're being diagnosed with PTSD and denied their rights when they come home?
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:23.863]  Well, there's an alternative to that, and it's acupuncture and a process called cupping, which is actually part of traditional Chinese medicine, cupping, where they actually use little vacuum cups and they can pull toxins right out of the body through the skin.
[00:26:24.663 --> 00:26:33.945]  It turns out that there's a military acupuncture is being tested here in Texas at some military bases, and it's being used in a limited role on the battlefield right now.
[00:26:35.086 --> 00:26:35.606]  And it works!
[00:26:35.806 --> 00:26:36.667]  That's the amazing thing.
[00:26:37.267 --> 00:26:38.068]  No side effects.
[00:26:38.468 --> 00:26:39.088]  No drugs.
[00:26:39.368 --> 00:26:40.609]  It doesn't cause psychosis.
[00:26:40.629 --> 00:26:42.010]  It doesn't promote suicides.
[00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.031]  It's virtually painless.
[00:26:44.391 --> 00:26:44.931]  It's easy.
[00:26:45.191 --> 00:26:45.952]  It's totally safe.
[00:26:46.412 --> 00:26:47.773]  Military acupuncture.
[00:26:48.313 --> 00:26:52.075]  I want to just encourage you all to use this term, to think about this.
[00:26:52.455 --> 00:26:53.876]  This is the way to protect our soldiers.
[00:26:54.236 --> 00:26:57.598]  Treat them with medicine that doesn't cause them to commit suicide.
[00:26:58.198 --> 00:27:00.999]  Military acupuncture works and cupping works.
[00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:02.959]  And there's another angle on all of this.
[00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:27.464]  Because rights of soldiers are being taken away now when they return back to the USA, if they've ever been diagnosed with PTSD, when soldiers are now facing any kind of counseling or even just talking to a doctor in the field, soldiers are now refusing to talk about any symptoms, any problems, anything at all because they know they're going to be diagnosed with PTSD and stripped of their rights.
[00:27:28.024 --> 00:27:28.905]  And I don't blame them.
[00:27:29.265 --> 00:27:31.987]  If I was a soldier out there, I would keep my lips sealed as well.
[00:27:32.287 --> 00:27:41.175]  I'd keep my trap shut and would not say that, oh, I'm, you know, whatever they might be feeling out there if they have thoughts of anger or whatever they have.
[00:27:42.324 --> 00:27:44.065]  Or aggression, or regret, or anything.
[00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:50.590]  I wouldn't say anything either, because they're going to put that on your record, and they're going to use that to take away your rights, your firearms.
[00:27:51.271 --> 00:27:52.091]  And who knows what else?
[00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:53.673]  Maybe your First Amendment rights someday.
[00:27:53.713 --> 00:27:57.635]  So, we've got to treat our soldiers, our active duty soldiers, and our veterans
[00:27:58.496 --> 00:28:01.217]  Better in this country and that means don't drug them up.
[00:28:01.237 --> 00:28:04.338]  Let's use things that actually work like military acupuncture.
[00:28:04.638 --> 00:28:11.080]  That's something you probably never heard of but it's it's actually working so let's hope that continues to gain some steam throughout the military.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.260]  All right, check this out.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.061]  Freedom license plate is banned in Washington DC.
[00:28:16.421 --> 00:28:18.542]  This is out of the Examiner Washington
[00:28:19.182 --> 00:28:33.769]  The word freedom is on the list of banned vanity license plates because you can't have somebody driving around Washington DC with such a such profane obscenity on their car as the word freedom.
[00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.851]  That's not allowed in the capital of this nation.
[00:28:38.212 --> 00:28:39.252]  Can't have the word freedom.
[00:28:39.892 --> 00:28:42.674]  You also cannot have the word Ron Paul.
[00:28:43.533 --> 00:28:45.795]  It's also banned, according to this article.
[00:28:45.855 --> 00:28:46.896]  So, no freedom.
[00:28:47.036 --> 00:28:48.617]  There is no freedom in Washington.
[00:28:48.717 --> 00:28:49.738]  Well, we already knew that.
[00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:52.880]  And Ron Paul is banned as a license plate.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.602]  I think we should give that license plate to Ron Paul.
[00:28:56.283 --> 00:28:57.184]  Like the domain name.
[00:28:57.524 --> 00:28:59.265]  We should give Ron Paul, ronpaul.com.
[00:28:59.505 --> 00:29:00.987]  I mean, come on guys, what's going on there?
[00:29:01.387 --> 00:29:02.508]  Give him the freakin' domain!
[00:29:02.588 --> 00:29:04.569]  It's his name!
[00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:09.853]  We should all get together, buy Ron Paul a new pickup truck and put Ron Paul on the license plate.
[00:29:09.893 --> 00:29:10.214]  How's that?
[00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:11.923]  He deserves it.
[00:29:12.464 --> 00:29:16.765]  Alright, more bad news about nightmare bacteria from the CDC.
[00:29:17.606 --> 00:29:23.008]  They are spreading the alarm on this new bacteria, the CRE bacteria.
[00:29:23.348 --> 00:29:28.110]  It's Carpapenum resistant bacteria that is resistant to all the
[00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:34.334]  The hardcore antibiotics, it's invading our hospitals, killing patients, and guess what?
[00:29:34.634 --> 00:29:43.080]  Medicine has no defense whatsoever against this bacteria because they've abused antibiotics year after year after year creating this situation.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.441]  A lot more straight ahead.
[00:29:44.461 --> 00:29:45.021]  Stay with us.
[00:29:45.061 --> 00:29:49.845]  This is the Alex Jones Show and we'll be right back after this break with a lot more breaking news.
[00:29:49.865 --> 00:29:50.325]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.745 --> 00:29:51.646]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.126 --> 00:29:53.727]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:57.330]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.889 --> 00:30:08.752]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[00:30:08.912 --> 00:30:13.374]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[00:30:13.534 --> 00:30:24.038]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[00:30:24.338 --> 00:30:37.913]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers, using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:40.016]  I think so.
[00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:06.422]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:06.762 --> 00:31:10.264]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:10.624 --> 00:31:12.886]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.906 --> 00:31:18.369]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:25.073]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:25.453 --> 00:31:31.016]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:31.417 --> 00:31:35.119]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:35.599 --> 00:31:39.580]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:45.381]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:48.762]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:49.382 --> 00:31:50.822]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:51.362 --> 00:31:51.862]  It's here.

[00:32:01.061 --> 00:32:02.682]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:32:02.942 --> 00:32:06.444]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:32:06.584 --> 00:32:10.987]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:32:11.127 --> 00:32:17.111]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:28.017]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:34.524]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:32:34.724 --> 00:32:49.459]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:32:49.879 --> 00:32:53.882]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:32:53.902 --> 00:32:56.083]  Homeland Security begins with hometown security.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:27.577]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scoring particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes.
[00:33:27.637 --> 00:33:31.043]  To recap those revisions, women
[00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:35.971]  ...are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets.
[00:33:36.672 --> 00:33:45.215]  But teenagers now rack up 40 points, and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[00:33:45.435 --> 00:33:54.218]  The big score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old, has been upped to 100 points.
[00:33:55.359 --> 00:34:01.281]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:08.992]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:09.593 --> 00:34:11.319]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:14.212 --> 00:34:19.896]  Oh, that was a brilliant video that, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV and you saw that video, absolutely brilliant.
[00:34:19.936 --> 00:34:25.739]  John Bowne put that together for the Death Race 2000 little satire bit there.
[00:34:25.759 --> 00:34:29.742]  He was showing a first-person shooter game with the targets.
[00:34:30.102 --> 00:34:37.367]  Remember the targets of women and children, even pregnant women, that were sold by that company that got exposed here on the Alex Jones Show?
[00:34:37.987 --> 00:34:41.330]  Well, John Bowne had put those targets into the first-person shooter game
[00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:50.837]  As if it was really Death Race 2000 and you're getting points for, you know, bagging women and children and old men, which of course is what that movie was all about.
[00:34:52.158 --> 00:34:53.659]  Just a brilliant piece of graphics.
[00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.222]  I tell you, the graphics team here is amazing and it's not just one person.
[00:34:57.282 --> 00:35:00.524]  It's like five people here are all graphic geniuses.
[00:35:00.745 --> 00:35:01.425]  It's quite amazing.
[00:35:02.766 --> 00:35:04.688]  So anyway, be sure to check that out.
[00:35:04.708 --> 00:35:07.250]  You can join up and see all the video of this at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:19.928]  Now, joining us for just a few minutes, a quick update by phone, live from the scene of where testimony is being given today in Maryland, is Liz Reitzig.
[00:35:20.448 --> 00:35:24.191]  She is, of course, one of the key leaders on the issue of raw milk freedom.
[00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:35.060]  She was part of the Raw Milk Freedom Riders and has been engaged in a lot of activism on the side of food freedom and milk choice freedom in America.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:41.305]  I can't even believe we have to have this conversation, but raw milk continues to be illegal in most states.
[00:35:41.325 --> 00:35:42.787]  So Liz is joining us today.
[00:35:43.067 --> 00:35:44.088]  She's about to give testimony.
[00:35:44.148 --> 00:35:45.949]  Liz, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:48.271]  Hi Mike, thanks so much for having me on.
[00:35:48.311 --> 00:35:48.952]  It's great to be here.
[00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:53.065]  Oh, well thanks for joining us and thanks for keeping me posted and in the loop on all of this.
[00:35:53.085 --> 00:35:54.266]  You're about to give testimony.
[00:35:54.547 --> 00:35:59.873]  I've got a copy of it in my hands, but give us the breakdown of what's going on there and what are you going to say?
[00:36:01.178 --> 00:36:10.746]  Well, basically, cow shares, which is a valid way for people to obtain raw milk, have been criminalized in Maryland for the past seven or eight years.
[00:36:11.346 --> 00:36:17.391]  And there is a bill in the legislature this session that would repeal that and reinstate cow shares in Maryland.
[00:36:17.451 --> 00:36:21.314]  And this is such a great option for people like me who live in the suburbs.
[00:36:21.454 --> 00:36:26.899]  I can't get my own cow, but I could get a cow and board it at a friend's farm and then get the milk from that animal.
[00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:36.106]  So if this bill goes through, this is a great way to revitalize the Maryland rural economy and get raw milk back to Maryland consumers from Maryland farmers.
[00:36:36.386 --> 00:36:42.451]  Well, that's very important, Liz, but I gotta ask you, how could Maryland have even outlawed cow shares in the first place?
[00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:45.354]  Doesn't every human being have the right to engage in a contract?
[00:36:45.374 --> 00:36:49.177]  You can own a share of a condo, you can own a share of a company, that's called buying stock.
[00:36:49.497 --> 00:36:51.699]  How could they have criminalized owning a share of a cow?
[00:36:52.139 --> 00:36:52.860]  Doesn't make any sense.
[00:36:53.683 --> 00:36:59.630]  Yeah, well what they did is, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, they changed the definition of sale of raw milk.
[00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.794]  So currently, before that, sales of raw milk were illegal.
[00:37:02.914 --> 00:37:09.121]  And they just altered the definition to include cow share arrangements or any animal, dairy animal
[00:37:09.702 --> 00:37:09.882]  Wow.
[00:37:09.922 --> 00:37:09.982]  Wow.
[00:37:33.499 --> 00:37:40.889]  So, I assume there's a lot of support for the repeal of that very bad, ill-conceived law.
[00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:45.776]  I know you're testifying, but tell us about the nature of the support today.
[00:37:45.816 --> 00:37:49.361]  Are there lots of people there to testify with you, or what's going on?
[00:37:50.205 --> 00:37:58.632]  Well, there are a tremendous number of people in support, but unfortunately, we are getting hit with our only snowstorm of the entire season today.
[00:37:58.652 --> 00:38:05.037]  So, a lot of people who were planning to be here in person are snowed in, and they're submitting their written testimony to the committee.
[00:38:05.197 --> 00:38:06.158]  And it will still be heard.
[00:38:06.798 --> 00:38:08.179]  And it's officially in the record.
[00:38:08.199 --> 00:38:09.439]  They just won't be here in person.
[00:38:09.479 --> 00:38:14.902]  Well, how appropriate since the entire criminalization of raw milk is such a snow job to begin with, I guess.
[00:38:15.002 --> 00:38:15.182]  Right.
[00:38:15.702 --> 00:38:19.444]  Nature is unfortunately interfering with your ability to repeal that.
[00:38:20.284 --> 00:38:24.706]  When is a decision expected based on all of this testimony?
[00:38:25.947 --> 00:38:32.970]  Well, the hearing is today and then usually the committee votes like anywhere from three days to a couple of weeks after the hearing.
[00:38:33.531 --> 00:38:34.391]  And then if it gets
[00:38:35.362 --> 00:38:44.049]  If it gets referred out of committee positively, like if enough members vote yes in favor of it, then it will go to the whole House here in Maryland.
[00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:49.974]  And then if it gets voted favorably out of the House, it'll cross over to the Senate and go through the same process there.
[00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:55.659]  So it's still got several steps that it needs to go through in order for this to become decriminalized.
[00:38:56.658 --> 00:39:07.222]  We are hoping to see this happen, and if not, we're just hoping to see a lot of awareness built around the issue and for more people to look at the issue and start engaging directly with their local farmers.
[00:39:07.742 --> 00:39:14.284]  So there are a lot of opportunities for the dairy industry to still intervene and make sure that this doesn't get repealed.
[00:39:14.824 --> 00:39:19.106]  Right, and they will be here today testifying in opposition, as well as the health department.
[00:39:19.997 --> 00:39:36.984]  So the dairy industry, just to be clear, I mean, I don't know what the case is there locally, but in other states I've seen the dairy industry be very, very aggressive at trying to monopolize the market of milk by, you know, criminalizing raw milk, fresh milk, and making sure that everybody has to buy their pasteurized, homogenized, factory-produced product.
[00:39:37.344 --> 00:39:40.045]  Is that, how bad is that situation in Maryland?
[00:39:40.065 --> 00:39:42.186]  Oh, it's awful in Maryland.
[00:39:43.701 --> 00:39:46.222]  About 20 years, we've lost over 500 dairies.
[00:39:46.262 --> 00:39:50.164]  We're down to only 496 right now, which is, it's dismal.
[00:39:50.304 --> 00:40:02.069]  And the prediction from the dairy industry itself is that we're going to continue to lose dairy farms, and the ones that are going to survive are going to continue to be subsidized by federal tax dollars.
[00:40:02.929 --> 00:40:04.770]  And their continued recommendation is
[00:40:05.797 --> 00:40:06.237]  Yeah.
[00:40:06.297 --> 00:40:06.897]  Incredible.
[00:40:07.357 --> 00:40:13.959]  Did you mention earlier that the name of the department there is called the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene?
[00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:14.579]  Is that correct?
[00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:15.239]  Mental Hygiene.
[00:40:15.259 --> 00:40:15.439]  What?
[00:40:34.574 --> 00:40:38.181]  Is that like cleaning your mind of any aberrant thoughts?
[00:40:38.923 --> 00:40:40.205]  What is mental hygiene?
[00:40:40.754 --> 00:40:44.836]  Well, I've heard it translated as brainwashing.
[00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:47.118]  Well, that's exactly what it is.
[00:40:47.618 --> 00:40:49.359]  Wow, the Department of Mental Hygiene.
[00:40:49.859 --> 00:40:51.260]  That should be in the novel 1984.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.282]  I mean, we should retroactively put that in the novel.
[00:40:55.542 --> 00:41:03.967]  The Department of Mental Hygiene cleansing you of all dirty thoughts such as individual ideas or fresh milk from a farm.
[00:41:04.067 --> 00:41:05.528]  Oh my God, what a terrible thing.
[00:41:06.328 --> 00:41:23.181]  Right, and that's one of the most important things to take away from this, and what I'm going to be asking the committee members to take away from this, is that currently peaceful individuals are being criminalized for normal, natural, peaceful human behavior, whether it's transporting raw milk across state lines, or the farmers who want to offer cow shares.
[00:41:23.521 --> 00:41:31.948]  This is criminal activity, but it's a very peaceful activity, and so I'm going to be asking them to look at it in that context, and to stop criminalizing our peaceful
[00:41:32.368 --> 00:41:37.489]  Well, and can you remind them that it's legal in Cuba to do this?
[00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:44.330]  It's legal to sell fresh milk in Communist China, in North Korea, you know?
[00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:45.210]  I mean, come on!
[00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.491]  America, land of the free?
[00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:51.531]  You can't buy and sell fresh milk from a farm?
[00:41:52.572 --> 00:41:55.192]  Our country was raised on raw milk!
[00:41:55.272 --> 00:41:56.252]  I mean, come on!
[00:41:56.272 --> 00:41:56.752]  That's right!
[00:41:56.912 --> 00:41:59.093]  I mean, it's completely backwards right now.
[00:41:59.433 --> 00:41:59.973]  It really is.
[00:42:00.413 --> 00:42:03.554]  Well apparently, Liz, you have not had enough mental hygiene.
[00:42:05.495 --> 00:42:07.276]  You need some more mental hygiene therapies.
[00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:12.558]  Give us your website so that people can stay tuned in to your blogs and everything.
[00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:22.523]  Well, I'm working with the Farm Food Freedom Coalition currently, so it's farmfoodfreedom.org, but we don't have updates on the specific legislation on that site.
[00:42:22.543 --> 00:42:29.766]  But if you go to realmilk.com, they have a section about what's going on in each state, and I'm pretty sure they'll be covering it as well.
[00:42:30.609 --> 00:42:31.310]  All right, RealMilk.com.
[00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:37.375]  It's also a great way for anybody out there who wants to connect to their local milk sources or other local food sources.
[00:42:37.435 --> 00:42:38.797]  It's a great resource for that.
[00:42:39.217 --> 00:42:40.158]  RealMilk.com.
[00:42:40.498 --> 00:42:44.061]  Well, Liz, you're an amazing activist and a great spokesperson.
[00:42:44.141 --> 00:42:47.405]  Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your testimony in Maryland.
[00:42:47.605 --> 00:42:49.106]  Keep us posted on the outcome, okay?
[00:42:49.727 --> 00:42:50.888]  Well, thank you so much, Mike.
[00:42:51.108 --> 00:42:51.708]  Have a great day.
[00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:52.209]  You too.
[00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:52.830]  Thank you, Liz.
[00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.273]  Well, there goes Liz Reitzig.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.622]  Farmfoodfreedom.org.
[00:42:59.942 --> 00:43:00.202]  Wow.
[00:43:00.262 --> 00:43:01.403]  I mean, isn't that amazing?
[00:43:01.443 --> 00:43:12.513]  An amazing commentary on the state of America today, where we can't even buy and sell raw milk without being raided at gunpoint and going to prison and being considered a felon?
[00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:13.994]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[00:43:14.014 --> 00:43:17.957]  I just... I can't believe that I have to sit here and talk about that.
[00:43:18.678 --> 00:43:26.040]  Of all the things that we should be talking about, I'd love to be talking about food self-reliance, how to grow your own food supply.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:32.181]  I'd love to be talking about consciousness and the nature of reality, but we've got to talk about the criminalization of raw milk.
[00:43:32.221 --> 00:43:33.201]  It drives me nuts.
[00:43:34.081 --> 00:43:40.683]  All right, let's move on to some other news, but real quick, guys, do we have Max wrangled in here yet?
[00:43:44.165 --> 00:43:48.229]  Okay, alright, Max is still AWOL at the moment.
[00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:56.177]  See, we're going to talk about Chavez, okay, and Venezuela and socialism, but we wanted to get Max in here to talk about that.
[00:43:56.277 --> 00:44:00.020]  We may run out of time because we've got guests coming up for the next hour, but you guys just let me know.
[00:44:00.421 --> 00:44:06.606]  In fact, if he shows up... Yeah, they told me that he's sobbing.
[00:44:07.759 --> 00:44:12.083]  At the very, very sad death of the tyrant, Chavez.
[00:44:13.424 --> 00:44:14.945]  Can you get him some more tissue?
[00:44:15.646 --> 00:44:16.286]  Clean him up.
[00:44:16.746 --> 00:44:18.228]  Give him some mental hygiene.
[00:44:18.628 --> 00:44:19.769]  And then we can get him in here.
[00:44:19.809 --> 00:44:20.229]  How about that?
[00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.651]  When he shows up, just bring him on in here.
[00:44:22.671 --> 00:44:23.892]  I don't care if you interrupt.
[00:44:24.433 --> 00:44:25.974]  Let's just go on to some other news.
[00:44:28.736 --> 00:44:43.225]  Yeah, the sound effects with it with it wasn't like a five-second delay All right, let me just say this about Chavez while while we're trying to wrangle in max Chavez is part of this cult of
[00:44:43.945 --> 00:44:46.306]  What I call giggling control freaks.
[00:44:46.826 --> 00:44:47.106]  Alright?
[00:44:47.466 --> 00:44:50.507]  These giggling control freaks are trying to take over the world.
[00:44:50.527 --> 00:44:53.488]  They think everything is so funny.
[00:44:53.508 --> 00:44:56.129]  Oh, there are no bullets.
[00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:59.070]  There are no armored vehicles.
[00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.611]  There are no assault rifles.
[00:45:01.631 --> 00:45:02.571]  They think it's so funny.
[00:45:02.931 --> 00:45:06.332]  Oh, Piers Morgan, why don't you just pop around into Alex Jones?
[00:45:06.352 --> 00:45:07.052]  It's so funny.
[00:45:07.072 --> 00:45:08.833]  Do it in uniform, too.
[00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:10.573]  Isn't it hilarious, they think?
[00:45:10.713 --> 00:45:12.114]  Everything's so funny to them.
[00:45:13.396 --> 00:45:14.617]  These giggling control freaks.
[00:45:14.677 --> 00:45:18.000]  Alright, enough of the giggling control freaks.
[00:45:19.521 --> 00:45:21.783]  But that's who's running the system, alright?
[00:45:22.423 --> 00:45:25.806]  And it's these people that want to run everything, every little detail of your life.
[00:45:26.346 --> 00:45:27.627]  And Chavez was just one of them.
[00:45:28.028 --> 00:45:29.409]  He wasn't the worst.
[00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:34.113]  I admit, Kim Jong Un is probably way worse than Chavez.
[00:45:34.493 --> 00:45:35.694]  It's a spectrum, okay?
[00:45:35.934 --> 00:45:40.357]  You've got Kim Jong Un on the far, far, far extreme radical left.
[00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:46.222]  And then you've got Chavez, sort of not quite as far left, but still pretty far left.
[00:45:46.262 --> 00:45:49.805]  And then you've got, you know, Obama right in there with the Chavez crowd.
[00:45:50.806 --> 00:45:54.850]  And, you know, you've got, you know, China, Communist China's over there.
[00:45:55.530 --> 00:46:01.876]  And then on the far, the complete opposite end of the spectrum on the Liberty side, you've got, like, Thomas Jefferson.
[00:46:02.196 --> 00:46:03.617]  Okay, that's the complete opposite.
[00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:06.299]  But these giggling control freaks are driving me nuts.
[00:46:07.202 --> 00:46:11.766]  They just want to run everything in your life, and it's like, hi, I'm Mrs. Bossy Pants.
[00:46:12.647 --> 00:46:24.598]  I'm Mrs. Bossy Pants, and I'm here to tell you how to run your life, and what to eat, and what to think, and what to drink, and we're going to engage in some mental hygiene, because I'm Mrs. Bossy Pants, the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:46:24.718 --> 00:46:32.385]  Well, I guess in that case, it would be like, the Department, I'm Jonathan Napolitano, the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:46:33.303 --> 00:46:38.387]  I'm Mrs. Bossy Pants, and here joining us today is Mrs. Smarty Pants.
[00:46:38.508 --> 00:46:51.659]  She's the economic advisor for running the Fed, and so I'm Mrs. Bossy Pants, and we have Smarty Pants, and also here for the Public Hygiene Department, we have Mrs. Poopy Pants.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.743]  So, together we are Bossy Pants, Smarty Pants, and Poopy Pants.
[00:46:56.763 --> 00:46:58.485]  We are the trio of government wisdom.
[00:46:59.165 --> 00:47:01.008]  And we are here to tell you how to run your life.
[00:47:01.468 --> 00:47:04.872]  And Chavez's death was such a terrible, terrible thing.
[00:47:04.912 --> 00:47:08.497]  We are sobbing in our beds today for Chavez.
[00:47:09.398 --> 00:47:10.259]  Oh, great one.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:11.541]  Why did you leave us?
[00:47:13.503 --> 00:47:17.308]  Okay, that's Mrs. Bossypants making an appearance here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:18.228 --> 00:47:19.869]  I'm sure I'll get called by Alex about that one.
[00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:21.109]  What were you doing, man?
[00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:22.890]  Sorry.
[00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:23.590]  Sorry.
[00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:28.072]  We both sometimes segue into weird characters, weird comedy.
[00:47:28.272 --> 00:47:29.993]  That's just the nature of the beast.
[00:47:30.293 --> 00:47:30.553]  All right.
[00:47:30.653 --> 00:47:33.094]  North Korea vows to cancel the Korean War.
[00:47:33.474 --> 00:47:34.454]  Cease fire.
[00:47:35.194 --> 00:47:39.836]  North Korea says that on March 11th, that's just coming up by my count.
[00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:40.256]  What is that?
[00:47:40.316 --> 00:47:41.097]  Five days away.
[00:47:41.957 --> 00:47:49.583]  On March 11th, it's going to cancel the Korean War ceasefire agreement that was originally signed in 1953.
[00:47:50.624 --> 00:48:02.292]  So, how wonderful will that be with an insane, completely insane tyrant, Kim Jong-un, who has nuclear weapons, alright?
[00:48:02.452 --> 00:48:06.796]  And this guy is testing more nukes to miniaturize them
[00:48:07.356 --> 00:48:28.196]  To put them on intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, so that he can launch them into high altitude, not even orbit, but just high altitude above North America, where he can detonate the nuke, which will of course cause a massive EMP blast that will fry the entire power grid.
[00:48:29.372 --> 00:48:39.001]  So, if there actually is a threat against America, a military threat, I'm not talking about the, you know, the fictional nonsense, war on terror, everything's war on terror.
[00:48:39.441 --> 00:48:42.524]  If there's a real threat against America, it's North Korea, alright?
[00:48:42.905 --> 00:48:52.533]  If there's a real justification for going in and taking out a crazy nuclear-armed tyrant who is threatening America like never before, this is it!
[00:48:53.234 --> 00:49:00.377]  Kim Jong-un, I mean if, look, overall I'm anti-war, overall, I'm anti-intervention I should say.
[00:49:00.717 --> 00:49:03.278]  But I'm pro-self-defense and I'm pro-national defense.
[00:49:03.659 --> 00:49:05.179]  This is a case for national defense.
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:22.827]  I mean, Kim Jong-un, if he gets those nukes onto those missiles and he launches them over, you know, California or Oregon or Washington and sets those off at high altitude, man, we're gonna have an EMP blast wave, your electronics are fried, internet's down, all these Facebook addicts are running around the streets like zombies trying to,
[00:49:22.927 --> 00:49:23.547]  I'm not online!
[00:49:23.587 --> 00:49:24.348]  I'm not online!
[00:49:24.588 --> 00:49:25.248]  What do I do?
[00:49:25.348 --> 00:49:26.529]  Where's Mrs. Bossypants?
[00:49:27.329 --> 00:49:28.170]  They're gonna freak out.
[00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.631]  And they're gonna be hungry in about six hours.
[00:49:30.651 --> 00:49:31.991]  They're gonna try to come after your food.
[00:49:32.012 --> 00:49:34.913]  I mean, that's a nightmare scenario.
[00:49:35.133 --> 00:49:39.095]  Imagine if all the Facebook trolls actually came out of their parents' basements all at once.
[00:49:39.735 --> 00:49:42.237]  Flooding the streets with trolls.
[00:49:43.517 --> 00:49:47.700]  And who actually have to face people face-to-face for the first time in their entire history.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.822]  It would be like... What's that movie with Bruce Willis?
[00:49:50.942 --> 00:49:51.702]  Surrogate, right?
[00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:52.122]  Remember that?
[00:49:52.343 --> 00:49:55.064]  Where they had to come out of their... They were all like... They had robots.
[00:49:55.604 --> 00:49:57.065]  They're virtual... It wasn't virtual reality.
[00:49:57.205 --> 00:49:59.267]  They were actually hardware robots running around the streets.
[00:50:00.313 --> 00:50:24.805]  And, but you would sit in your simulator control bed at home while your robot, your surrogate, was out there on the streets interacting with people and the surrogate was always like super cool, you know, model, face, perfect hair, everything, while the people back at home in their beds were all like these giant sloths and, you know, pale, diseased, you know, can hardly, muscle atrophy, can't even get out of the bed.
[00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:28.426]  That's what we become in society today.
[00:50:28.466 --> 00:50:31.247]  So many people are not getting even out.
[00:50:32.088 --> 00:50:36.109]  And if they have to get out, it's going to look like a zombie apocalypse.
[00:50:36.189 --> 00:50:38.490]  Even if it's not for real, it's going to look like it.
[00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:42.072]  And it's going to be, it's going to be real chaos.
[00:50:42.112 --> 00:50:47.854]  So we better, we better shut down Kim Jong Un, is my point, before he gets those nukes flying our direction.
[00:50:48.214 --> 00:50:48.615]  All right?
[00:50:49.055 --> 00:50:49.515]  Stay with us.
[00:50:49.535 --> 00:50:51.457]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:51.838 --> 00:50:56.483]  A lot more straight ahead, and I will get more serious, I promise, when we come back.

[00:54:08.703 --> 00:54:11.427]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:23.507 --> 00:54:24.588]  All right, we're continuing.
[00:54:24.768 --> 00:54:25.629]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.910]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.693]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[00:54:32.353 --> 00:54:37.697]  And be sure to check out InfoWars.com for the latest breaking news by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:38.178 --> 00:54:40.919]  My website's NaturalNews.com if you want to check that out.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:46.443]  And I've got a story on Hugo Chavez today and the cancer of socialism.
[00:54:47.604 --> 00:55:04.972]  By the way, Aaron Dykes just was talking to me during the break and he said that when he heard the phrase mental hygiene in our interview with Liz Reitzig that that set off a red flag in his mind because you know he researches a lot of the of the history of control of humans and the Rockefellers and eugenics and everything else and he said yeah
[00:55:05.712 --> 00:55:12.816]  That that phrase, mental hygiene, is a keyword of the eugenics movement, and that's the name of the Maryland Department.
[00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:17.759]  It is actually called, what is it, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
[00:55:18.279 --> 00:55:18.999]  That's the name!
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.221]  When Liz said that, it freaked me out.
[00:55:21.241 --> 00:55:27.864]  I thought she misspoke or something, but no, that's the actual name of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
[00:55:29.162 --> 00:55:38.072]  By that, they probably mean castrating people of low IQ to fulfill their eugenics little agenda.
[00:55:38.733 --> 00:55:40.635]  You know, that's probably the history there.
[00:55:40.755 --> 00:55:44.059]  I bet that's part of the history of that department in Maryland.
[00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:45.580]  I mean, I can't say for sure.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.802]  I haven't done that research yet.
[00:55:47.884 --> 00:55:54.968]  But I bet that's part of the agenda, and it's eugenics and depopulation, and Aaron Dykes, of course, knows all about that.
[00:55:55.248 --> 00:56:08.256]  Racial hygiene, mental hygiene, and also, hey, don't forget the whole history of psychiatry, where a psychiatrist would do things like, if they thought you were mad, they would start pulling organs out of your body.
[00:56:09.116 --> 00:56:15.520]  In fact, there was one psychiatrist, in fact, he was the president of the American Psychiatric Association way back
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.040]  I believe he was.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.661]  His name was Dr. Henry Cotton.
[00:56:19.222 --> 00:56:22.603]  And if you were crazy, he would start pulling your teeth out.
[00:56:23.204 --> 00:56:28.826]  And he would actually extract teeth, and then he started extracting, like, nasal tissue from people.
[00:56:28.846 --> 00:56:31.568]  I mean, very painful stuff, until you were cured.
[00:56:32.128 --> 00:56:39.632]  And if you were still mad after having, you know, all your teeth pulled out, then he would just start, you know, yanking more and more tissue until he got to the real disease.
[00:56:39.652 --> 00:56:41.333]  You know, that's psychiatry for you right there.
[00:56:41.593 --> 00:56:42.493]  I'm not even making that up.
[00:56:42.874 --> 00:56:43.354]  That's real.
[00:56:44.491 --> 00:56:44.771]  I don't
[00:57:01.838 --> 00:57:05.342]  That whole term means hysterectomy.
[00:57:05.362 --> 00:57:07.704]  It means getting out the hysteria.
[00:57:08.245 --> 00:57:13.410]  And that surgery was originally pushed as a way to prevent women from being crazy.
[00:57:13.891 --> 00:57:14.912]  I'm not making this up!
[00:57:15.372 --> 00:57:18.275]  This is true history that you gotta know!
[00:57:19.156 --> 00:57:28.164]  The entire word, hysterectomy, means take the craziness out of the woman, and that's the history of psychiatry.
[00:57:28.484 --> 00:57:29.605]  That's the history of medicine.
[00:57:30.126 --> 00:57:30.766]  It's insane.
[00:57:31.227 --> 00:57:39.894]  So I'm not surprised to see the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene being named the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
[00:57:40.715 --> 00:57:49.137]  By the way, if you want some real healthy health support, immune support, we've got clean chlorella now in the InfoWars store.
[00:57:49.497 --> 00:57:53.118]  This is the chlorella, this is the stuff that I source, the cleanest in the world.
[00:57:53.138 --> 00:57:53.979]  We did the lab test.
[00:57:54.519 --> 00:57:58.900]  It's a superfood, about one-half to two-thirds protein, loaded with chlorella and trace minerals.
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:00.360]  Clean Chlorella.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:12.406]  It's at InfoWarsStore.com, along with our full spectrum Himalayan salt loaded with healthy trace minerals and our turmeric extract, which is the most potent turmeric extract made from organic turmeric.
[00:58:12.426 --> 00:58:17.349]  So help support InfoWars by finding that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:20.690]  All right, when we come back, we're going to talk about Chavez.
[00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.911]  We're finally going to get into that for real this time.
[00:58:23.412 --> 00:58:24.352]  I'm not joking around.
[00:58:25.073 --> 00:58:25.513]  Not anymore.
[00:58:25.613 --> 00:58:27.414]  We're going to get into Chavez's death.
[00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.845]  But, unfortunately, not the death of his philosophies.
[00:58:31.246 --> 00:58:33.227]  And then we're going to have James Stewart on in the next hour.
[00:58:33.607 --> 00:58:37.849]  Other guests joining us, plus Aaron Dykes and David Knight in the third hour.
[00:58:37.869 --> 00:58:39.130]  So stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:47.835]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:54.191 --> 00:59:56.112]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.572 --> 00:59:59.355]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:06.556]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:08.257]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.998 --> 01:00:10.118]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.759 --> 01:00:11.579]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.240]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:17.483]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:22.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.588 --> 01:00:32.711]  Welcome to the second hour of the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, March 6th, 2013.
[01:00:34.795 --> 01:00:37.439]  Yeah, we've already had an interesting show and it's going to get even more fun.
[01:00:37.479 --> 01:00:40.884]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today.
[01:00:41.785 --> 01:00:45.030]  Alex has taken the entire week off of the show.
[01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:48.194]  And I guess he's going to be back Monday.
[01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:49.276]  That's what I'm hearing anyway.
[01:00:50.185 --> 01:00:52.646]  I spoke to him yesterday and this morning.
[01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:53.466]  He's doing great.
[01:00:53.706 --> 01:00:56.687]  He's still working though.
[01:00:56.927 --> 01:00:58.868]  Alex never really totally stops working.
[01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:04.290]  So he's shooting videos and commenting and doing things, which I don't blame him.
[01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:06.410]  I can't stay away from all the crazy news either.
[01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:07.711]  You got to comment sooner or later.
[01:01:08.351 --> 01:01:14.333]  But the schedule, in case you're curious, I believe that tomorrow some of the Infowarriors here are going to be hosting.
[01:01:14.373 --> 01:01:15.573]  I think Aaron Dykes is hosting.
[01:01:16.274 --> 01:01:18.174]  And maybe McBreen?
[01:01:18.314 --> 01:01:18.534]  Maybe?
[01:01:18.554 --> 01:01:19.095]  I'm not sure.
[01:01:19.775 --> 01:01:22.095]  And then Friday I think Catherine Albrecht is back on.
[01:01:22.115 --> 01:01:25.196]  I want to thank Catherine for hosting the last couple of days.
[01:01:25.937 --> 01:01:29.358]  I'm not scheduled to host again until maybe another week.
[01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:38.006]  So anyway, I always enjoy being here and I thank you for your support in this great, this time of great challenges, Alex says.
[01:01:38.086 --> 01:01:45.315]  We are all InfoWarriors fighting the InfoWar so that we don't have to fight the physical war, the real war.
[01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:47.877]  Of people slinging lead downrange.
[01:01:48.117 --> 01:01:53.418]  Now, of course, as I talked about in the first hour, the radical left believes that all that's imaginary.
[01:01:53.438 --> 01:01:57.780]  There are no bullets, there are no guns, there are no armored vehicles being purchased by DHS.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.820]  It's all just, ah, it's all your imagination.
[01:02:00.221 --> 01:02:01.781]  But you and I know that it's actually real.
[01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:06.503]  And so, we want to fight the info war so that we can prevent the shooting war.
[01:02:07.043 --> 01:02:13.485]  But we're not going to settle for anything less than the complete restoration of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:15.363]  That's the bottom line.
[01:02:16.004 --> 01:02:21.871]  And I know that those words that I just spoke reflect what many of you feel out there.
[01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:27.037]  We are not settling for anything less than the complete restoration of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[01:02:27.617 --> 01:02:28.138]  Why should we?
[01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:29.259]  We're Americans.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.842]  We were built on resistance to tyranny.
[01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:42.896]  You know, we're just, we're not gonna voluntarily go along with another Chavez type of ruination of the economy as he has done in Venezuela.
[01:02:43.096 --> 01:02:44.498]  Not, not gonna happen here.
[01:02:44.778 --> 01:02:45.558]  Not in America.
[01:02:46.299 --> 01:02:47.520]  Definitely not in Texas.
[01:02:48.861 --> 01:02:50.422]  Definitely not in Central Texas.
[01:02:51.243 --> 01:02:51.964]  Not gonna happen.
[01:02:52.524 --> 01:02:54.506]  Alright, but let's, let me get to some other news real quick.
[01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:55.607]  Just go through some headlines here.
[01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:57.651]  Economic collapse.
[01:02:58.071 --> 01:03:03.836]  The Dow hits an all-time high, meaning a bubble is always biggest right before it bursts.
[01:03:04.296 --> 01:03:06.118]  You know why the Dow is hitting a new high, by the way?
[01:03:06.158 --> 01:03:08.199]  Because the money is increasingly worthless.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:25.353]  It's being eroded, deteriorated by the continued quantitative easing, infinite quantitative easing, from the Federal Reserve pumping more money into the money supply, making your dollars worth less and less every single day, making the stock market look like it's higher and higher because it's
[01:03:26.983 --> 01:03:31.791]  The numbers of the stock market are actually worthless dollars, or increasingly worthless dollars.
[01:03:31.932 --> 01:03:35.839]  It is denominated, the Dow is denominated in dollars, right?
[01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:37.945]  There you go.
[01:03:38.305 --> 01:03:43.706]  Attorney General Holder, oh we already covered this, the president, can assassinate Americans on U.S.
[01:03:43.826 --> 01:03:44.186]  soil.
[01:03:44.406 --> 01:03:54.929]  How comforting to know that, that we have such an incredible defender of law and due process sitting at the helm who says, yeah, we can just kill you any time we want.
[01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.509]  All right.
[01:03:56.689 --> 01:03:56.969]  U.S.
[01:03:57.049 --> 01:04:01.430]  plots conquest of Venezuela in the wake of Chavez's death.
[01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:10.932]  This is by Tony Cartalucci at InfoWars.com, and I'm not sure what the source of this story is, but apparently the U.S.
[01:04:10.992 --> 01:04:16.653]  think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, says that it wants the U.S.
[01:04:16.693 --> 01:04:26.075]  administration to have key demands to influence Venezuela now in the wake of Chavez no longer being in power there.
[01:04:26.115 --> 01:04:26.415]  By the way,
[01:04:27.851 --> 01:04:31.313]  I just want to mention, again, I don't know if I gave the website correctly.
[01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:32.454]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:04:32.894 --> 01:04:36.417]  We've got Himalayan salt, we've got chlorella, and it's clean chlorella.
[01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:39.599]  Now it's not hermetically sealed or anything, but it's super clean.
[01:04:40.179 --> 01:04:45.743]  It's packaged right here in Texas in a certified organic facility, so be sure to check that out if you want some superfoods.
[01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:49.706]  We've got James Stewart coming up right after this break, plus more news straight ahead.
[01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:52.247]  So stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:52.287 --> 01:04:52.968]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.576 --> 01:05:04.638]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:05:04.998 --> 01:05:10.462]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:05:11.042 --> 01:05:14.244]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:05:14.925 --> 01:05:16.185]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[01:05:16.526 --> 01:05:20.368]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[01:06:01.565 --> 01:06:02.586]  I had tried everything.
[01:06:02.646 --> 01:06:07.708]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:06:08.128 --> 01:06:12.610]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:19.333]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:30.304]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[01:06:35.509 --> 01:06:38.512]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[01:06:38.872 --> 01:06:41.533]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:06:41.753 --> 01:06:42.914]  Now that's results.
[01:06:43.314 --> 01:06:49.757]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.

[01:08:14.035 --> 01:08:17.657]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.238 --> 01:08:22.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.874 --> 01:08:27.656]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:27.696 --> 01:08:29.817]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex today.
[01:08:29.857 --> 01:08:30.918]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:30.958 --> 01:08:43.108]  This is the second hour of our three-hour transmission live from Austin, Texas on this Wednesday, March 6, 2013, the day after Hugo Chavez perished.
[01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:45.131]  At least his physical body did.
[01:08:45.431 --> 01:08:47.614]  We can only guess where his soul is now.
[01:08:48.135 --> 01:08:50.798]  But his body has perished, apparently from cancer.
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:59.630]  And Venezuela is, of course, in kind of turmoil right now, and no one's exactly sure what this means, what's going to happen next.
[01:09:00.251 --> 01:09:04.393]  But here to give us a little bit of perspective on this is Max Cabrera.
[01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.634]  He's an employee here at InfoWars.
[01:09:07.074 --> 01:09:08.194]  He's from Venezuela.
[01:09:08.674 --> 01:09:11.856]  He doesn't have, you know, he's obviously not there, so he doesn't know.
[01:09:11.916 --> 01:09:13.737]  It's not like I'm right on the street.
[01:09:13.777 --> 01:09:16.758]  No, he's here in Austin, Texas, but at least he can give us some perspective.
[01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:18.779]  So Max, thank you for joining us today.
[01:09:18.799 --> 01:09:19.819]  Thanks for coming in studio.
[01:09:19.839 --> 01:09:21.040]  Mike, thank you for the opportunity.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:21.900]  Glad to be here.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.341]  So give us, what do you know so far?
[01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:26.122]  Well, I have some information.
[01:09:26.142 --> 01:09:31.285]  I have been calling people in Venezuela and they're telling me, first of all, the streets are calm.
[01:09:31.826 --> 01:09:33.106]  The army is out there.
[01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:41.412]  They are taking care of the places, the gas stations, grocery stores, because there has been a lot of panic buyers on the streets.
[01:09:41.832 --> 01:09:45.614]  And also, there has been a little bit of looting in certain areas.
[01:09:45.854 --> 01:09:47.355]  But everything is under control now.
[01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:54.260]  Basically, the country is calm in action, but they are all confused about what's going to happen.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:54.801]  Right.
[01:09:55.121 --> 01:09:59.368]  Right now, the president is the former vice president of Venezuela.
[01:10:00.069 --> 01:10:01.652]  His name is Nicolás Maduro.
[01:10:01.952 --> 01:10:06.599]  He's going to be the president for the next 30 days, and then we will have elections there.
[01:10:07.492 --> 01:10:13.615]  We don't know the candidates yet from opposition or from the Chavez party.
[01:10:13.996 --> 01:10:15.877]  We're still waiting on that.
[01:10:18.338 --> 01:10:24.522]  But even thinking about that, though, an opposition candidate would have to be a candidate that would say, well, let's return more to a free market system.
[01:10:25.082 --> 01:10:33.607]  But how do you even propose that when so much of the Venezuelan population is now on the government payroll getting the free everything?
[01:10:33.627 --> 01:10:35.668]  I mean, that seems unlikely.
[01:10:35.848 --> 01:10:38.130]  Right, the opposition don't feel like they have a victory.
[01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:42.273]  Because yes, the communism has been very well implemented in Venezuela.
[01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:44.655]  A lot of people became dependent on the government.
[01:10:45.035 --> 01:10:49.739]  And now the governors there, they keep pushing it like we have to keep going on this revolution.
[01:10:49.759 --> 01:10:54.543]  They are taking all the ideology from Chavez and pushing it.
[01:10:54.983 --> 01:10:57.025]  So there's nothing safe.
[01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:01.028]  We can't say that, okay, we're out of communism now in Venezuela.
[01:11:01.408 --> 01:11:01.988]  Right, right.
[01:11:02.668 --> 01:11:12.331]  Well, and of course, when they talk about they want to continue the revolution, they're talking about the Chavez revolution, which I guess he tried to begin in the early 1990s, but then he got into power in what, 98?
[01:11:12.671 --> 01:11:12.851]  Yes.
[01:11:13.451 --> 01:11:18.093]  And then he's been taking government seizing, private industry, taking over the economy.
[01:11:18.573 --> 01:11:26.435]  Also, I saw it was reported that Chavez himself amassed a personal fortune of $2 billion while his own countrymen were, you know, living in extreme poverty.
[01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:30.897]  Well, yeah, he's been related to several, uh, weird scenarios.
[01:11:31.477 --> 01:11:36.959]  I don't have evidence, but there have been some cases where he's been related to drug dealing.
[01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:39.060]  Nothing, nothing for sure.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:39.660]  Right.
[01:11:40.701 --> 01:11:44.142]  Well, I guess, I guess at this point then, uh, what, you know,
[01:11:45.848 --> 01:11:51.912]  We can't really do much here from America as seniors, but the people of Venezuela, I feel, deserve better than Chavez.
[01:11:51.972 --> 01:11:52.753]  That's my feeling.
[01:11:53.053 --> 01:11:54.193]  That's my feeling too.
[01:11:54.834 --> 01:11:58.736]  Especially because my family, they used to have businesses that were taken over.
[01:12:00.057 --> 01:12:02.359]  Some of the businesses we're still waiting to get paid for.
[01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:04.000]  I think so.
[01:12:27.753 --> 01:12:35.935]  Well, I want to wish your family safety and blessings to them and all of your countrymen and women, of course.
[01:12:36.295 --> 01:12:41.417]  I want to see Venezuela become more free.
[01:12:41.437 --> 01:12:46.218]  I suspect you do as well, but whatever happens, will you keep us posted?
[01:12:46.699 --> 01:12:47.219]  Yes, of course.
[01:12:48.459 --> 01:12:55.122]  If the elections, whenever we have the date for the elections, I will go down there to Venezuela to vote and I will bring some video and pictures.
[01:12:55.202 --> 01:12:59.625]  I will talk to the people over there and I will bring that back to you.
[01:12:59.725 --> 01:13:06.268]  Real quick, do you think, will Venezuelan elections be as corrupt as American elections are or will they be more honest?
[01:13:06.308 --> 01:13:10.951]  Actually, I was surprised the way they do the elections because I went over there and I actually have some footage of it.
[01:13:12.251 --> 01:13:13.312]  You have to vote.
[01:13:13.332 --> 01:13:16.674]  You do an electronic vote and then you get a receipt of your vote.
[01:13:17.034 --> 01:13:18.635]  Oh yeah, we don't get receipts in America.
[01:13:18.655 --> 01:13:27.760]  You put it in another box and then at the end of the day you're welcome to come in and they print out what they have electronically and then they count all the receipts.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:28.420]  Oh wow.
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.101]  Everybody's welcome to see it, and I was actually there.
[01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:31.761]  Common sense.
[01:13:31.841 --> 01:13:35.401]  It has to match, you know, what they have in the boxes, what they have electronically.
[01:13:35.781 --> 01:13:40.382]  And then, when it's approved by the people that was there, they send that information.
[01:13:40.863 --> 01:13:46.724]  So, it looks like if they are corrupting the elections, they are doing it fantastically, because it's not cash.
[01:13:46.744 --> 01:13:51.585]  Well, how amazing is it that Venezuela runs a more
[01:13:52.918 --> 01:14:00.726]  Well, a checksum system in the elections, which is smarter than the way we run them here, which is all just total electronic black box voter fraud.
[01:14:00.786 --> 01:14:05.131]  And something else is that we do get a president because of the votes of the people.
[01:14:05.831 --> 01:14:09.655]  So if somebody has 100 votes, that's what you're getting, 100 votes.
[01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:10.776]  If you have 1,000, then you get 1,000.
[01:14:11.077 --> 01:14:13.279]  So it's not here like the electoral votes.
[01:14:13.559 --> 01:14:14.540]  Oh, the Electoral College.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.480]  The Electoral College.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.400]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:16.741 --> 01:14:21.723]  And also, now, Venezuela doesn't have a Bill of Rights like America does.
[01:14:22.103 --> 01:14:29.767]  It has a constitution, but it doesn't enumerate specific rights in the same way that we have it here.
[01:14:30.287 --> 01:14:30.727]  Correct?
[01:14:30.987 --> 01:14:31.308]  Correct.
[01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:40.252]  So, is that a barrier to the people protecting themselves from the march of tyranny?
[01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:48.428]  Well, in Venezuela we have a problem which we have a lot of laws, but they are not being considered.
[01:14:48.788 --> 01:14:52.529]  For example, right now, Nicolas Maduro, the Vice President, he shouldn't be the President.
[01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:53.090]  He shouldn't?
[01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:53.570]  He shouldn't.
[01:14:53.610 --> 01:14:55.491]  He should be Diosdado Cabello.
[01:14:56.371 --> 01:15:00.373]  And he just assigned this other guy to be the President meanwhile.
[01:15:00.813 --> 01:15:06.356]  So even though we have the Constitution and we have rights, they are really not implemented.
[01:15:06.396 --> 01:15:09.898]  At the end of the day, it's kind of a tyranny going on there, and they do whatever they want.
[01:15:10.618 --> 01:15:15.579]  And last question for you, Max, because I know you've got a lot of work to do here, but isn't... it's oil.
[01:15:15.619 --> 01:15:21.641]  I mean, oil is the big moneymaker in Venezuela, so it really comes down to who controls the oil, doesn't it?
[01:15:21.701 --> 01:15:22.961]  Right, yeah, it is like that.
[01:15:24.042 --> 01:15:29.683]  So, nobody knows in Venezuela, like, the prices of the oil, we don't know if they're going to go up.
[01:15:30.263 --> 01:15:32.724]  I can tell you right now Venezuela is in a phase where...
[01:15:33.624 --> 01:15:34.704]  They don't know what's happening.
[01:15:34.905 --> 01:15:35.145]  Yeah.
[01:15:35.305 --> 01:15:38.146]  They don't know what's coming next, if it is something better or worse.
[01:15:39.706 --> 01:15:44.188]  Yesterday, as soon as the news was given, I tried calling my family.
[01:15:44.308 --> 01:15:45.909]  They called, couldn't get in.
[01:15:45.949 --> 01:15:47.730]  I mean, people got excited.
[01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:49.991]  People went out to the streets to buy water, food.
[01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:51.951]  People don't blame them.
[01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:53.012]  Yeah, they don't know what's going on.
[01:15:53.672 --> 01:15:58.034]  Well, and I think, by the way, Chavez, he only died at age 58, I believe, right?
[01:15:58.274 --> 01:15:58.474]  Right.
[01:15:58.654 --> 01:15:59.314]  Very young.
[01:15:59.334 --> 01:16:00.015]  Very young, yes.
[01:16:00.315 --> 01:16:04.537]  And he probably didn't know that there are natural cures for cancer.
[01:16:04.797 --> 01:16:05.337]  Many of them.
[01:16:06.055 --> 01:16:08.716]  Yeah, I think it's sad that he went to Cuba to get treatment.
[01:16:09.176 --> 01:16:16.417]  We have great doctors in Venezuela, and actually I would say we have a better medical industry in Venezuela than there is in Cuba.
[01:16:17.798 --> 01:16:19.098]  So I'm shocked that he went over there.
[01:16:19.118 --> 01:16:22.939]  I think that's like a slap in the face for the doctors in Venezuela.
[01:16:22.959 --> 01:16:23.739]  Yeah, it is, really.
[01:16:24.039 --> 01:16:26.520]  And maybe he was scared of all the doctors there.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:33.482]  So, I mean, it is shocking how he just left the country to get this treatment there.
[01:16:33.842 --> 01:16:36.343]  Probably he didn't know about natural ways to do it.
[01:16:36.824 --> 01:16:41.466]  Well, you know, only the really high-level elite know about the cures for cancer.
[01:16:41.766 --> 01:16:49.649]  Because, you know, the global elite, like the top 1,000 controllers of the world, they have easy access to all these cures.
[01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:52.410]  But they don't want the public to know about them.
[01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:53.871]  Well, thank you, Max, for the update.
[01:16:54.531 --> 01:16:59.117]  On Venezuela and Hugo Chavez no longer being with us.
[01:16:59.137 --> 01:17:02.040]  I have to say he was a great leader.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:05.665]  Seriously, he knew how to talk to people, he knew how to relate to people.
[01:17:07.027 --> 01:17:09.590]  Well, I mean, Obama, I mean, Hitler was a great orator.
[01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:13.152]  Yes, I'm not saying he was doing something right or wrong.
[01:17:13.172 --> 01:17:14.693]  I'm just saying he was a great leader.
[01:17:14.893 --> 01:17:19.736]  Right now there are thousands and thousands of people on the streets supporting him.
[01:17:19.816 --> 01:17:22.057]  They want to see his body.
[01:17:22.777 --> 01:17:25.939]  So he was really a great leader in South America and around the world.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.282]  Too bad his ideology wasn't the most appropriate for the country.
[01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:40.206]  Well, you know, I used to live in South America, not Venezuela, but I noticed that the cultures there do tend to side towards socialism and communism.
[01:17:41.327 --> 01:17:45.029]  That just seems to be part of the cultural reflection down there.
[01:17:45.349 --> 01:17:53.693]  But I do believe that the people of Venezuela deserve much better than Chavez, and I would like to see that nation become a nation of liberty and individual freedom.
[01:17:53.953 --> 01:17:54.474]  I would like that, too.
[01:17:54.694 --> 01:17:55.154]  Well, thank you, Max.
[01:17:55.174 --> 01:17:55.754]  Thank you very much.
[01:17:56.835 --> 01:18:07.782]  All right, that was Max Cabrera, everybody, here in studio at InfoWars.com with a little bit of first-hand knowledge of what's going on in Venezuela.
[01:18:08.502 --> 01:18:11.464]  Now, continuing, by the way, we've got James Stewart on the line.
[01:18:11.484 --> 01:18:14.726]  We actually have him by Skype, guys.
[01:18:14.746 --> 01:18:15.667]  Is he on the line?
[01:18:17.253 --> 01:18:17.954]  Okay, great, great.
[01:18:17.974 --> 01:18:23.940]  Because we sort of delayed James Stewart because of Max coming in with the breaking news on Chavez.
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.862]  So, let me just say this.
[01:18:26.983 --> 01:18:29.004]  There's another story on Infowars.com.
[01:18:29.085 --> 01:18:35.451]  Russian leader demands the investigation of Chavez's death and they're trying to blame his death on America.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:40.182]  Yeah, they're saying America gave him cancer.
[01:18:40.962 --> 01:18:45.285]  Which, actually, if you think about it, America gives Americans cancer.
[01:18:45.485 --> 01:18:47.606]  So, it's really not that far-fetched.
[01:18:48.186 --> 01:18:56.211]  Maybe Chavez came to America, drank some diet soda, ate a bunch of aspartame, got some GMOs, took some vaccines, and yeah, you know, he died of cancer.
[01:18:56.251 --> 01:19:01.154]  Just like half the American population, because, you know, of all this toxic food and medicine in this country.
[01:19:01.174 --> 01:19:02.274]  So, maybe they're right.
[01:19:02.675 --> 01:19:04.316]  Maybe America did give the guy cancer.
[01:19:04.376 --> 01:19:04.696]  Who knows?
[01:19:05.939 --> 01:19:07.339]  All right, let's transition.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.560]  We've got an incredible story here.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.881]  Many of you know James Stewart.
[01:19:11.921 --> 01:19:15.602]  He's known as the California raw milk man, but this story today is not about raw milk.
[01:19:16.482 --> 01:19:20.863]  This is about one man overcoming state tyranny.
[01:19:21.183 --> 01:19:24.024]  The state of California tried to destroy this man.
[01:19:24.084 --> 01:19:25.245]  They threw him in jail.
[01:19:25.265 --> 01:19:28.725]  I mean, they practically tortured him in prison there.
[01:19:28.746 --> 01:19:29.726]  I'm not going to go into details.
[01:19:30.646 --> 01:19:33.547]  But they mistreated him like you can't even believe.
[01:19:34.268 --> 01:19:36.268]  And they brought him up on multiple felony charges.
[01:19:36.308 --> 01:19:40.350]  They tagged him in the jail system as a dangerous prisoner.
[01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:47.373]  They tried to crush him and he has come back with an entrepreneurial victory that will make you cheer.
[01:19:47.893 --> 01:19:51.475]  And he'll be joining us straight ahead right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:51.535 --> 01:19:54.156]  It's James Stewart joining us by Skype.
[01:19:54.176 --> 01:19:57.257]  So stay with us and we'll be right back with that interview and much more straight ahead.
[01:20:01.738 --> 01:20:04.760]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.

[01:22:30.215 --> 01:22:31.275]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.455 --> 01:22:35.838]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:41.742]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.822 --> 01:22:45.204]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:23:02.463 --> 01:23:03.525]  Political turmoil.
[01:23:03.625 --> 01:23:04.446]  EMPs.
[01:23:04.606 --> 01:23:05.167]  Earthquakes.
[01:23:05.307 --> 01:23:05.928]  Tornadoes.
[01:23:06.088 --> 01:23:06.748]  Hurricanes.
[01:23:06.909 --> 01:23:07.389]  Fires.
[01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:07.970]  Riots.
[01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:08.551]  Flooding.
[01:23:08.711 --> 01:23:10.553]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[01:23:10.693 --> 01:23:11.975]  What if it happened right now?

[01:24:12.403 --> 01:24:32.554]  All right, for this segment and into the next, we're going to be joined by California raw milk man James Stewart with his story of overcoming an attempted crushing of his liberties and freedoms by the state, not just the state of California, but the fed, the federal government had a hand in the raw milk raids against him.
[01:24:32.614 --> 01:24:34.435]  But again, he's got a story of coming back from that.
[01:24:34.976 --> 01:24:37.317]  And James, thank you for joining us today on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:40.182]  It's great to have you on.
[01:24:40.222 --> 01:24:46.646]  Sorry about the delay there, but you know, Hugo Chavez dying was definitely some breaking news we needed to cover there.
[01:24:47.206 --> 01:24:52.709]  Well, I was actually listening to that and I think just one choice of words in there should have been changed.
[01:24:52.749 --> 01:24:57.412]  And when he called him a great leader, I think great sort of connotates the idea of good.
[01:24:57.472 --> 01:24:59.794]  I think he should have used the word powerful leader.
[01:25:00.259 --> 01:25:00.499]  Right.
[01:25:00.959 --> 01:25:01.400]  That's right.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.362]  Yeah, I don't think that Max, you know, worships Chavez or anything.
[01:25:05.402 --> 01:25:10.165]  I think he was saying that he was an effective manipulator of the masses.
[01:25:10.505 --> 01:25:10.805]  Exactly.
[01:25:10.865 --> 01:25:11.366]  Basically.
[01:25:12.226 --> 01:25:13.187]  Yeah, well said.
[01:25:13.247 --> 01:25:14.788]  Thanks for helping us clarify that.
[01:25:15.168 --> 01:25:28.096]  So, James, you've got an amazing story here laid out for us, but just quickly, first, give us a very quick background of what happened to you, for those who may not be familiar with your story, and then we'll go into how you've overcome that.
[01:25:29.261 --> 01:25:45.610]  Well, you know, for 15 years we, uh, we, uh, when I say we, the community that was, uh, was called Rawson, um, you know, continued to grow until the community was over a thousand people approximately of people that wanted to find the highest quality foods.
[01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:54.034]  And that was always a influx as well, always looking for higher quality foods, but we were continually being attacked 2005, 2010, and then finally closed in 2011 with my arrest.
[01:25:54.074 --> 01:25:54.235]  And, uh,
[01:25:59.457 --> 01:26:06.181]  You know, it turned out to... I thought that it would all end pretty quickly, and it did not at all, and it just kept on going.
[01:26:06.481 --> 01:26:07.301]  The case in L.A.
[01:26:07.321 --> 01:26:23.470]  was postponed and then continued, and then we... then I, myself, and a lady named Sharon Palmer were arrested while standing in court on March the 2nd of last year for more felonies for the farm being purchased in Santa Paula.
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:34.165]  Of course, I and the club had very little to do with the investment in the farm, if anything, and that was handled by other people.
[01:26:34.825 --> 01:26:42.348]  And so, you know, I ended up going to jail, actually, on my birthday of this last year.
[01:26:42.368 --> 01:26:49.912]  I was in jail for almost four and a half to five months, and then was transferred to L.A.
[01:26:49.952 --> 01:26:51.833]  And by the way, when I was arrested for the
[01:26:52.705 --> 01:27:12.956]  The charges in March the 2nd of last year, I was actually taken first to Twin Towers downtown LA, which is where they took me, singled me out of line, out of hundreds and hundreds of, I would consider real criminals, you know, the people that were the thieves and the drug addicts and the murderers and whatever.
[01:27:13.556 --> 01:27:19.479]  Singled out by two guards, taken into an office and accused of being, and asked me if I were a sovereign.
[01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:21.569]  And I said, I don't know what you mean by that.
[01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:39.914]  And, uh, anyway, the long story was short is that they labeled me that and tortured me at that point by shackling me hand and foot and shackled me to a bench, put me in a holding tank for about five or six hours in a tank that probably was, uh, nobody was in there, cold, about 50 degrees with a t-shirt on.
[01:27:40.454 --> 01:27:42.974]  And then finally, four days later, transferred to Ventura.
[01:27:42.994 --> 01:27:45.935]  Well, when I was transferred back after I left jail in Ventura,
[01:27:46.647 --> 01:27:48.889]  And they scanned my wristband that I had on there.
[01:27:48.909 --> 01:27:51.912]  The guy backed up from his desk and said, you've attacked guards?
[01:27:51.932 --> 01:27:53.873]  And I said, excuse me?
[01:27:53.893 --> 01:27:56.296]  And the man said, oh no, shackle this man.
[01:27:56.696 --> 01:28:06.905]  So obviously the status that now exists for me in the Los Angeles jail system is one as of a sovereign, which means that I'm a threat to everybody and I'm a terrorist.
[01:28:07.045 --> 01:28:10.948]  So yeah, this is incredible because your crime is distributing milk.
[01:28:12.609 --> 01:28:13.409]  Unpasteurized milk.
[01:28:13.429 --> 01:28:16.290]  So they label you in the jail system as a sovereign.
[01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:22.132]  They have you wear a special armband just like, you know, Hitler made the Jews back in, you know, Nazi time.
[01:28:23.052 --> 01:28:25.652]  They treated you like worse than a terrorist.
[01:28:26.273 --> 01:28:27.093]  It's an incredible story.
[01:28:27.113 --> 01:28:32.034]  I don't want to dwell on that, but I'm glad you provided that background so people know why this story is important.
[01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:34.595]  And by the way, you are correct.
[01:28:34.655 --> 01:28:39.476]  The wristbands they put on you are different colors depending on your supposed status.
[01:28:40.168 --> 01:28:40.809]  That's incredible.
[01:28:41.890 --> 01:28:46.353]  But despite this, I mean, their goal, I mean, you're a man in your mid-60s.
[01:28:47.014 --> 01:28:47.855]  You're not a young man.
[01:28:47.915 --> 01:28:53.380]  Most of those people were in there were young and better able to handle that, but they subjected you to hypothermia, a type of torture.
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.042]  But yet you've been able to overcome this.
[01:28:56.102 --> 01:28:57.964]  Now, we're going to break in one minute.
[01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:06.277]  And I want you to tell the complete story now of what you're doing now to rise out of this attempt to crush your freedoms and crush your life.
[01:29:06.737 --> 01:29:08.498]  I want to do that when we come out.
[01:29:09.519 --> 01:29:13.321]  But in the one minute we have left, give us an update.
[01:29:13.441 --> 01:29:16.662]  Are you still facing charges in one county, or is that resolved?
[01:29:16.942 --> 01:29:22.505]  No, still facing charges in one county, and we're not sure where that's going to go.
[01:29:24.432 --> 01:29:25.292]  It's daunting.
[01:29:25.352 --> 01:29:31.313]  You know, I mean, at one point I had three criminal cases and three civil cases that I was dealing with all at the same time.
[01:29:32.114 --> 01:29:32.534]  Incredible.
[01:29:32.594 --> 01:29:36.314]  And they confiscated all your food, all your cash, threw you in jail, destroyed the food.
[01:29:36.334 --> 01:29:37.895]  It's just incredible.
[01:29:38.055 --> 01:29:38.895]  And destroyed the club.
[01:29:39.235 --> 01:29:39.855]  Destroyed the club.
[01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:40.495]  Yeah, it's shut down.
[01:29:40.555 --> 01:29:40.955]  It's gone.
[01:29:41.055 --> 01:29:41.455]  It's gone.
[01:29:41.495 --> 01:29:44.676]  Sounds like something Hugo Chavez would have done in Venezuela, actually.
[01:29:44.696 --> 01:29:45.976]  Anyway, stay with us, folks.
[01:29:45.996 --> 01:29:50.857]  We'll be right back with James Stewart and his success story of overcoming tyranny on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:50.877 --> 01:29:51.457]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:53.478]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.483 --> 01:29:57.304]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.665 --> 01:30:05.166]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[01:30:05.446 --> 01:30:08.527]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[01:30:08.688 --> 01:30:11.128]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[01:30:11.508 --> 01:30:13.449]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[01:32:54.292 --> 01:33:08.883]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.117 --> 01:33:31.541]  All right, continuing with our interview with James Stewart, and his achievement is victory over attempted oppression.
[01:33:31.941 --> 01:33:38.904]  The state tried to crush his freedoms, tried to throw him in jail for the crime of selling raw milk in America.
[01:33:40.425 --> 01:33:47.128]  Something that's not even illegal in Cuba, in China, in North Korea, or, you know, Peru, or anywhere else, it seems like.
[01:33:47.248 --> 01:33:48.689]  But in America, it is a crime.
[01:33:49.755 --> 01:33:50.355]  For most places.
[01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:59.698]  So anyway, James, go ahead now, tell us what you're doing now as a victory against their attempt to crush your life.
[01:33:59.718 --> 01:34:16.163]  Okay, well, the one thing I wanted to share with people for 30 seconds is the reason why they have done this sovereign thing is because people actually believe, like Judge Napolitano, you see him on TV all the time, you know, the Constitution still exists.
[01:34:16.886 --> 01:34:29.099]  Their justification and answer to my question is why, was, well, people have been murdering other people and killing other people and calling them sovereigns, they're shooting police officers and what, so how do we know that's not you?
[01:34:31.541 --> 01:34:34.044]  That was their answer, I asked them the question, that was their answer.
[01:34:34.329 --> 01:34:39.115]  Well, you know, according to the Constitution, we're all sovereign individuals, are we not?
[01:34:39.215 --> 01:34:49.829]  And their answer is, so everybody's aware of that, is now if you actually believe in the Constitution, pretty much you're already labeled as a sovereign, which means that you're already a terrorist.
[01:34:50.222 --> 01:34:58.044]  Well, did you hear in the first hour we covered all the bullets being purchased by the government, the assault rifles, the armored vehicles?
[01:34:58.104 --> 01:34:59.425]  It's all imaginary, we're told.
[01:34:59.845 --> 01:35:03.506]  Yes, I heard that, and I'm fully aware of all that as well.
[01:35:04.026 --> 01:35:17.670]  But, you know, to get back to your question, one of the products that we had on the shelf at the club was one of the most amazing products that I ever came across, and it was an olive oil out of the country of Spain.
[01:35:18.476 --> 01:35:23.658]  In which the trees themselves are anywhere from three to eight hundred, almost a thousand years old.
[01:35:23.678 --> 01:35:25.219]  I was amazed.
[01:35:25.339 --> 01:35:37.903]  And the story about this oil is the man that resurrected all this also resurrected two mills, which had been idle for, you know, for 20, 30, 40 years and never changed the inside of the mill.
[01:35:37.923 --> 01:35:45.206]  So they're produced the same way that olive oil has been produced for thousands of years, which is just big granite stones crushing it.
[01:35:45.826 --> 01:35:49.207]  And then some pressure to push out the oil and whatnot.
[01:35:49.247 --> 01:35:51.887]  Then it's only bottled upon request.
[01:35:51.967 --> 01:35:55.268]  So our first shipment will be arriving in about 30 days.
[01:35:55.568 --> 01:36:06.590]  And, you know, people came in and purchased it at Rossum and would come back saying, oh my God, that's the best alcohol I've ever tasted.
[01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:13.712]  You know, and the person who runs the company, his name is Antonio Ray Soule, is a former organic beekeeper.
[01:36:13.752 --> 01:36:15.012]  So the man understands
[01:36:15.732 --> 01:36:15.932]  No, no.
[01:36:34.571 --> 01:36:37.353]  Well, the trees themselves are 800 years old.
[01:36:37.373 --> 01:36:40.494]  I don't know if the property has changed hands how many times.
[01:36:40.574 --> 01:36:41.615]  Oh, I'm sure.
[01:36:42.375 --> 01:36:46.077]  The trees themselves, and you see these trees, they're just magnificent.
[01:36:46.117 --> 01:36:56.583]  And by the way, I'm not sure that the people involved with me want to give out the website yet because it will be inundated most likely when it happens.
[01:36:57.064 --> 01:36:59.365]  I think we might have to wait about another week or so.
[01:36:59.565 --> 01:37:00.946]  Yeah, it's no big deal.
[01:37:01.527 --> 01:37:04.309]  I'll do a story about your website when the time comes.
[01:37:04.689 --> 01:37:14.197]  Here today is more about how you are achieving an entrepreneurial victory and creating business and creating prosperity when they tried to crush you.
[01:37:14.217 --> 01:37:22.864]  I mean, the state of California would rather you rot in prison, but instead you are creating opportunities and health for people.
[01:37:22.924 --> 01:37:23.544]  That's amazing.
[01:37:23.805 --> 01:37:24.745]  Mike, I never give up.
[01:37:25.106 --> 01:37:26.026]  I'll be 66 in July.
[01:37:28.616 --> 01:37:29.297]  No, you're right.
[01:37:29.897 --> 01:37:37.582]  And by the way, I have no desire to collect unemployment or be entitled to the handouts and whatnot.
[01:37:37.642 --> 01:37:39.343]  I've never functioned that way.
[01:37:39.403 --> 01:37:44.186]  And I actually said when I was in jail that that was what I was planning to do.
[01:37:44.727 --> 01:37:52.932]  This whole thought of mine to do this and become the exclusive distributor for this incredible product was actually launched last year before I was even put in jail.
[01:37:53.473 --> 01:37:56.595]  And luckily, the owner of the company decided he'd wait for me.
[01:37:57.015 --> 01:37:57.275]  Wow.
[01:37:57.535 --> 01:37:58.076]  What a great guy.
[01:37:59.437 --> 01:38:19.012]  Well, what do you see as, given the experience of what happened to you, because I can imagine when you were a child, let's say, and growing up and going to elementary school, and they were teaching you American history, and you were doing the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, you never could have imagined, I would say, that you would be thrown in jail over milk.
[01:38:20.158 --> 01:38:28.223]  I never imagined I'd be thrown in jail for helping to provide high-quality foods to people in a private membership club.
[01:38:28.283 --> 01:38:34.607]  No, the thought of that now, to me, is incredulous and it's insanity, but that's exactly what has happened.
[01:38:35.868 --> 01:38:38.109]  And you felt it personally.
[01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:44.992]  Are you concerned about the direction of this country?
[01:38:46.514 --> 01:38:47.554]  Where do you think this is all going?
[01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:50.497]  Seriously concerned.
[01:38:50.617 --> 01:38:58.544]  You and I talk about this and you report on this all the time about what's going on with the quality of the food sources around the country and around the world.
[01:38:59.304 --> 01:39:08.733]  You know, I see what's going on, not only with what happened to us, but what's happening to farmers of all different kinds, whether it's produce, pigs, or milk, or whatnot.
[01:39:09.693 --> 01:39:21.424]  It's getting crazier every day, and you hear stories even more and more all the time where they're basically trying to squash anybody that wants to get involved in, I guess, high-quality, you know, food.
[01:39:21.644 --> 01:39:21.824]  Right.
[01:39:21.904 --> 01:39:29.867]  Well, we heard from Liz Reitzig earlier that the number of dairies, small private dairies, or commercial dairies in Maryland has been reduced by 50%.
[01:39:31.647 --> 01:39:32.747]  We saw what?
[01:39:33.408 --> 01:39:41.750]  The pigs in Michigan, the farmers were ordered to shoot their own pigs to kill them because of that crazy law that just went into effect there.
[01:39:42.190 --> 01:39:47.292]  We've seen front yard gardens attacked in Michigan, in Oklahoma, in Florida.
[01:39:48.092 --> 01:39:52.954]  We've got the raw milk raids on you, the Morningland Dairy in Missouri, and many others.
[01:39:52.994 --> 01:39:55.315]  I mean, these keep adding up, James.
[01:39:55.775 --> 01:39:58.476]  They're now into the hundreds, I'm guessing.
[01:39:58.996 --> 01:40:09.000]  It just seems like it's going to get worse rather than better, and I just think that everybody needs to be more and more aware of what's really going on on the food source issue.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:17.924]  I think codes, regulations, laws are all being written and forced upon people, and then you can't even, even when you're supposedly doing it correctly, they
[01:40:17.944 --> 01:40:18.886]  We still come after you.
[01:40:18.947 --> 01:40:21.794]  I mean, my favorite story is the Farm to Fork in Nevada.
[01:40:23.086 --> 01:40:25.987]  Oh, that's where they raided that outdoor picnic type of thing?
[01:40:26.527 --> 01:40:33.269]  It was 16 or a dozen or so farmers all meeting on each other's private property, bartering each other.
[01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:36.550]  I'll give you eggs if you give me produce or your chicken or whatnot.
[01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:43.652]  And they were contacted by the county and the state of Nevada saying that they needed a permit to do it.
[01:40:43.692 --> 01:40:52.574]  And then when she got the permit, they came and basically after she had given them authority to control her, they came and poured bleach over everything and destroyed the entire community.
[01:40:52.714 --> 01:40:54.255]  Well, that's the pattern that we see here.
[01:40:54.355 --> 01:40:56.416]  It is the destruction of food.
[01:40:56.976 --> 01:40:59.698]  And this fits the pattern from the top, from the White House.
[01:40:59.898 --> 01:41:01.979]  The destruction of the economy.
[01:41:02.439 --> 01:41:03.760]  The destruction of jobs.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.320]  The destruction of liberties.
[01:41:06.221 --> 01:41:15.105]  Eric Holder just said yesterday, this is a letter to Senator Rand Paul, that yes, the President can order the assassination of American citizens on U.S.
[01:41:15.325 --> 01:41:15.706]  soil.
[01:41:15.846 --> 01:41:19.007]  That's the Attorney General saying that.
[01:41:19.067 --> 01:41:20.428]  And that's blatantly illegal.
[01:41:20.888 --> 01:41:24.490]  I saw that with Judge Napolitano being interviewed this morning.
[01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:26.491]  I like that guy.
[01:41:26.511 --> 01:41:28.211]  Yeah, I really like him.
[01:41:28.392 --> 01:41:31.233]  Well, why do you think they took his show, Freedom Watch, off the air?
[01:41:31.293 --> 01:41:31.953]  Well, of course, yeah.
[01:41:31.973 --> 01:41:32.834]  It can't have too much freedom.
[01:41:32.854 --> 01:41:33.154]  Did you see?
[01:41:33.394 --> 01:41:35.795]  You can't even have a freedom license plate in Washington, D.C.
[01:41:35.815 --> 01:41:36.535]  that's been banned.
[01:41:37.156 --> 01:41:38.096]  No, I didn't know that.
[01:41:38.136 --> 01:41:40.737]  No, you can't drive around Washington with the word freedom on your car.
[01:41:41.638 --> 01:41:42.138]  It's illegal.
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:46.280]  Yeah, it is insane.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:53.165]  Well, we're about out of time here, James, but I know you don't want to give out your olive oil website yet, but do you have another website?
[01:41:53.185 --> 01:41:54.485]  Well, you'll be helping me out with that anyway.
[01:41:54.585 --> 01:41:59.228]  Yeah, we'll get it out for you, but do you have a blog website or something where people can follow you and what you're doing?
[01:41:59.248 --> 01:42:01.690]  Yeah, I might as well give it out.
[01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:11.696]  It's under the name Olifleash, and Fleash is the town in Spain where the olive oil is produced, and that is pronounced or spelled F-L-I-X.
[01:42:12.745 --> 01:42:13.466]  As in North America.
[01:42:29.312 --> 01:42:33.275]  Yeah, this is kind of a pre-launch situation, but really, I just thank you for joining us.
[01:42:33.295 --> 01:42:47.226]  I'm just glad that you have refused to lie down, you've refused to become part of the system that was trying to crush you, and you are standing out with American innovation and entrepreneurial ideas, and that's what made America great.
[01:42:47.606 --> 01:42:50.228]  And I will be until the day I'm not here anymore, Mike.
[01:42:50.368 --> 01:42:51.008]  Good for you, man.
[01:42:51.028 --> 01:42:52.149]  Well, good to have you on today.
[01:42:52.429 --> 01:42:53.030]  Mike, thank you.
[01:42:53.490 --> 01:42:53.690]  All right.
[01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:54.190]  Thank you, James.
[01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:56.692]  That was James Stewart, everybody.
[01:42:56.812 --> 01:43:05.538]  The now resurging, reborn in a new entrepreneurial context, California raw milk man.
[01:43:06.218 --> 01:43:12.683]  I'm going to be dealing with olive oil now, from hundreds of years old trees in Spain.
[01:43:14.404 --> 01:43:15.625]  It's an amazing story.
[01:43:15.685 --> 01:43:18.326]  I like to have these stories of success against the system.
[01:43:18.947 --> 01:43:22.910]  And actually, if you think about it, Infowars is another story of success against the system.
[01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:27.013]  They tried to buy out, essentially, Alex Jones and put him on the networks.
[01:43:27.073 --> 01:43:28.414]  They tried to say, here, take this money.
[01:43:28.434 --> 01:43:29.255]  We'll make you famous.
[01:43:29.856 --> 01:43:30.636]  And he said, no.
[01:43:30.716 --> 01:43:32.118]  He said, I'm going to build it myself.
[01:43:32.358 --> 01:43:35.821]  I'm going to, I'm going to, you know, wherever it leads me, I'm going to do it myself.
[01:43:36.381 --> 01:43:36.822]  And he did.
[01:43:37.042 --> 01:43:38.944]  And that's why InfoWars is here today.
[01:43:40.345 --> 01:43:43.407]  So, Dr. Len Saputo joins us now for the next segment.
[01:43:43.507 --> 01:43:44.929]  He's on the phone with us.
[01:43:45.850 --> 01:43:48.432]  Dr. Saputo, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:50.384 --> 01:43:51.885]  Thanks for being on.
[01:43:51.905 --> 01:43:53.306]  It's great to have you joining us.
[01:43:53.366 --> 01:44:06.515]  Now, for our listeners who may not be familiar with you, you are, of course, a doctor with a lot of alternative and holistic medical knowledge and integration therapies, lots of experience in that realm.
[01:44:07.276 --> 01:44:16.783]  But I wanted to talk to you today about two things in particular, Dr. Saputo, and that is GMOs and vaccine damage to children.
[01:44:17.363 --> 01:44:18.264]  Which one do you want to start with?
[01:44:18.644 --> 01:44:19.405]  Either one doesn't matter.
[01:44:19.685 --> 01:44:27.530]  Alright, well let's start with the vaccines because there's news that just came out today that vaccines increase the risk of narcolepsy in children by an astonishing amount.
[01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:36.896]  We've also had recent admissions by the scientific community that flu shots given to pregnant women cause a massive increase in spontaneous abortions.
[01:44:37.536 --> 01:44:41.699]  So we know that the vaccines are killing babies and when they're not killed they're often damaged.
[01:44:42.039 --> 01:44:44.461]  What are your thoughts on the subject, Dr. Saputo?
[01:44:45.379 --> 01:44:49.625]  Well, we know that the whole flu shot industry is a scam.
[01:44:50.266 --> 01:44:53.831]  There is very little data that shows that, first of all, the shot even works.
[01:44:54.332 --> 01:45:01.342]  In fact, there's some data suggesting that it actually increases the risks that we have for getting influenza.
[01:45:03.084 --> 01:45:05.345]  It has not been tested for its safety adequately.
[01:45:05.985 --> 01:45:21.893]  When you talk to people like Tom Jefferson, who is from the Cochrane Group, which is a very prestigious group, he says that the only thing that we really need to do if we're going to solve this problem is go ahead and take one group of people who has had the vaccine
[01:45:22.888 --> 01:45:32.514]  And see how they do over a year, whether or not it works or it doesn't work and what kind of side effects and complications there are, and take another group and dunk it in the vaccine and see what happens.
[01:45:33.075 --> 01:45:39.419]  And of course, that is a simple, inexpensive, very effective way of testing vaccines, but nobody wants to do that.
[01:45:39.479 --> 01:45:40.820]  Yeah, they refuse to do that test.
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:44.302]  They don't, because they're horrified of the data that would come out of that.
[01:45:44.722 --> 01:45:45.723]  Well, I think that's true.
[01:45:45.883 --> 01:45:49.207]  You're talking about an industry that's got a tremendous amount of income.
[01:45:49.227 --> 01:45:55.394]  You're looking at hundreds of billions of dollars every year that comes in that way, so it's not like it's a small amount of money.
[01:45:56.064 --> 01:45:56.144]  Yeah.
[01:46:20.251 --> 01:46:23.274]  Right, leading their global vaccine division, I believe.
[01:46:23.534 --> 01:46:23.975]  Oh, right.
[01:46:23.995 --> 01:46:27.458]  And some of the things they came out with with this vaccine is just atrocious.
[01:46:27.958 --> 01:46:29.880]  I mean, the data behind it is terrible.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:32.162]  I wrote an article called The Infection Deception.
[01:46:32.943 --> 01:46:33.804]  That's a free article.
[01:46:33.824 --> 01:46:35.305]  It was published in the Townsend Letter.
[01:46:35.325 --> 01:46:39.970]  If people want to go to my website at drsaputo.com, it's free and on the homepage.
[01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:44.536]  Is your website, is it D-R Saputo or spelled out Dr. Saputo?
[01:46:44.697 --> 01:46:45.338]  Either way.
[01:46:45.358 --> 01:46:45.398]  Oh.
[01:46:46.019 --> 01:46:48.383]  D-R-S-A-P-U-T-O will get you there.
[01:46:48.584 --> 01:46:49.646]  Okay, you're a smart man.
[01:46:49.686 --> 01:46:51.249]  Cover every combination.
[01:46:51.269 --> 01:46:52.210]  There you go.
[01:46:52.745 --> 01:46:53.625]  Well, what about this?
[01:46:53.685 --> 01:46:56.466]  I mean, they could make clean vaccines if they wanted to.
[01:46:56.506 --> 01:47:01.768]  They could make single-shot vaccines that have no mercury, no MSG, no formaldehyde.
[01:47:02.188 --> 01:47:19.834]  They could do that, but it seems to me, when this is my next question for you, do they, is it, is it such a deep conspiracy that they're actually intentionally using vaccines as a way in which to damage babies on purpose?
[01:47:20.214 --> 01:47:25.816]  Well, you know, you'd have to think that when you look at what's happened, that something like that is happening.
[01:47:26.416 --> 01:47:29.837]  You wouldn't think anybody would be vindictive enough to do that.
[01:47:29.857 --> 01:47:32.878]  That's what they're doing.
[01:47:32.898 --> 01:47:33.399]  Yeah.
[01:47:33.799 --> 01:47:43.302]  And so, I mean, you have to make the assumption that somebody doesn't care about our children and they're trying or they do care about them enough that they want to make them sick because that's what's
[01:47:44.246 --> 01:47:57.758]  Well, or that they care about profit more than lives, because if you brain damage a child, or you damage their immune system with an early vaccine, you actually generate recurring profits in the pharmaceutical industry for decades.
[01:47:57.898 --> 01:47:58.499]  Well, that's right.
[01:47:58.819 --> 01:48:00.841]  So it's a business investment.
[01:48:00.881 --> 01:48:04.584]  The vaccine is a business investment in a damaged life.
[01:48:05.085 --> 01:48:09.689]  Well, what you're looking at is a whole system in this country where money talks.
[01:48:10.302 --> 01:48:14.403]  And where service is, if it's there, that's fine, but if it's not, they don't really care.
[01:48:14.423 --> 01:48:16.143]  I mean, look at the Vioxx story.
[01:48:16.643 --> 01:48:25.065]  I mean, when the pharmaceutical industry put that drug out in 1994, they knew that that was going to kill people with heart attacks and strokes.
[01:48:25.225 --> 01:48:25.425]  Yeah.
[01:48:25.585 --> 01:48:30.426]  When the drug came out in 1999, they didn't do anything to mention that to the FDA that we know about.
[01:48:30.446 --> 01:48:38.027]  Yet in 2004, when finally the FDA was forced to take it off the market because there were about 50,000 deaths from heart attacks and strokes,
[01:48:39.768 --> 01:48:42.170]  I mean, there was no punishment.
[01:48:42.651 --> 01:48:43.772]  It was a high murder.
[01:48:44.452 --> 01:48:50.497]  Well, no, I believe it wasn't a Dr. David Graham, the chief FDA scientist, who even testified to that fact.
[01:48:51.118 --> 01:48:51.578]  Exactly.
[01:48:51.638 --> 01:48:53.320]  And for several other drugs as well.
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:49:06.071]  So, I mean, just that one drug, Vioxx, if you really look at the numbers, the one drug, according to FDA scientist testimony, killed more Americans than the entire Vietnam War.
[01:49:07.535 --> 01:49:11.616]  You're talking about a pittance of deaths when you look in Big Pharma.
[01:49:12.117 --> 01:49:18.939]  I mean, there were 10,000 deaths, not even that, from the whole war that was in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.
[01:49:19.399 --> 01:49:31.203]  And we lose 400,000 people a year, and this is documented, okay, from pharmaceutical drugs and side effects and complications and things that happen, you know, even the way
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:48.700]  Well that's why it's so astonishing to me that the mainstream media will play up things like Sandy Hook and the shooting of several dozen children which is absolutely tragic and those lives should not be lost but then you've got an industry that's killing orders of magnitude more children
[01:49:49.838 --> 01:49:58.422]  You know, every day, through vaccines and chemotherapy drugs are now given to pregnant women, which causes spontaneous abortions.
[01:49:58.442 --> 01:50:00.743]  The flu shots are given to pregnant women.
[01:50:01.203 --> 01:50:01.784]  It's insane.
[01:50:02.458 --> 01:50:05.559]  Well, there's no question that the system is insane.
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:13.763]  And that's what happens when you have a level of consciousness, which we have in this country, which is about me, my mind, and my stuff.
[01:50:14.084 --> 01:50:15.484]  It's not about community.
[01:50:15.564 --> 01:50:17.845]  It's not about trying to build community.
[01:50:17.865 --> 01:50:19.506]  It's not about taking care of your neighbor.
[01:50:19.546 --> 01:50:20.707]  It's about working together.
[01:50:21.187 --> 01:50:27.530]  And until we increase our level of consciousness to a different level, we'll never solve these problems that we're facing.
[01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:30.253]  So being outraged isn't sufficient.
[01:50:30.273 --> 01:50:32.295]  You have to evolve into that place.
[01:50:32.495 --> 01:50:32.795]  I agree.
[01:50:32.835 --> 01:50:34.317]  You want to be the change you want to see.
[01:50:34.357 --> 01:50:44.327]  Well let's talk about that change because first give us, well we're about to go to break, but when we come back from break I want you to give us what can people do instead of taking a flu shot?
[01:50:44.547 --> 01:50:45.068]  There you go.
[01:50:45.108 --> 01:50:45.889]  What works better?
[01:50:45.909 --> 01:50:46.870]  A lot.
[01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.970]  Yeah, a lot better.
[01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:52.232]  Because like you, I haven't taken a shot in more than a decade.
[01:50:52.532 --> 01:50:55.153]  I can't even remember the last time I had a vaccine.
[01:50:56.293 --> 01:50:58.334]  And health has only improved since then.
[01:50:58.754 --> 01:51:00.055]  Hardly ever get sick.
[01:51:00.875 --> 01:51:05.337]  I just rely on... If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[01:51:05.637 --> 01:51:08.718]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[01:51:08.898 --> 01:51:11.319]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[01:51:11.699 --> 01:51:13.620]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.661]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[01:52:01.652 --> 01:52:03.252]  Hey everybody, Ty Bollinger here.
[01:52:03.373 --> 01:52:05.673]  Once again, real life, real stories.
[01:52:06.073 --> 01:52:07.433]  And he discovered Carnivora.
[01:52:07.854 --> 01:52:12.675]  He was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his family and his friends and his patients.
[01:52:12.955 --> 01:52:14.395]  My dad was a family physician.
[01:52:14.415 --> 01:52:15.355]  He was a medical doctor.
[01:52:15.375 --> 01:52:18.236]  Almost all the symptoms were either diminished or gone.
[01:52:18.256 --> 01:52:20.396]  Amazing product, amazing results.
[01:52:20.456 --> 01:52:27.718]  It's like an amazing thing having such a profound change in how I feel and knowing that it was the Carnivora that did it.
[01:52:28.078 --> 01:52:29.560]  And a lot of patients got better.
[01:52:30.081 --> 01:52:34.105]  Ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.
[01:52:34.386 --> 01:52:41.374]  Here's the toll-free telephone number to call to access the Carnivora Telecast at carnivora.com on Tuesday, March 12th, 8 p.m.
[01:52:41.434 --> 01:52:41.914]  Eastern Time.
[01:52:42.195 --> 01:52:42.475]  Call 1-888-625-7000.
[01:52:43.496 --> 01:52:43.716]  I think?
[01:53:00.822 --> 01:53:02.763]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[01:53:03.223 --> 01:53:05.924]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[01:53:06.524 --> 01:53:08.265]  Some people think the answer is gold.
[01:53:08.685 --> 01:53:09.925]  Others think it's a gun.
[01:53:10.285 --> 01:53:12.126]  But the correct answer will shock you.
[01:53:12.666 --> 01:53:20.489]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[01:53:21.529 --> 01:53:24.592]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[01:53:24.873 --> 01:53:26.714]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[01:53:27.035 --> 01:53:34.021]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[01:53:34.522 --> 01:53:39.006]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[01:53:39.502 --> 01:53:45.427]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[01:53:45.747 --> 01:53:46.528]  You'll be shocked.
[01:53:47.088 --> 01:53:51.792]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:57.396]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:53:57.777 --> 01:53:59.138]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[01:54:01.283 --> 01:54:16.643]  Before you slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss, another
[01:54:19.597 --> 01:54:20.757]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:54:20.797 --> 01:54:22.037]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:22.057 --> 01:54:24.458]  We're joined by Dr. Len Saputo right now.
[01:54:24.478 --> 01:54:45.062]  We're talking about vaccine-damaged babies and how the system seems to be actually intentionally trying to poison children and pregnant mothers with the vaccines because they could, if they chose, make so-called clean vaccines which don't have the toxic metals and chemicals that are known to cause neurological damage and basically brain lobotomies.
[01:54:45.862 --> 01:54:49.225]  So, Dr. Saputo, we, before the break, we said we're going to talk about some solutions.
[01:54:49.726 --> 01:54:51.267]  What works better than a flu shot?
[01:54:51.788 --> 01:54:52.929]  Oh, just about everything.
[01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:55.111]  We don't even know the flu shot works.
[01:54:55.151 --> 01:55:01.076]  We have no data, no data, that shows that the flu shot works for kids or really anybody else.
[01:55:01.477 --> 01:55:03.759]  Okay, that's a powerful statement to make, but it's true.
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.422]  Our lifestyle is the most important thing.
[01:55:06.802 --> 01:55:08.083]  Vitamin D in particular.
[01:55:08.183 --> 01:55:09.305]  Get out and get some sun.
[01:55:09.865 --> 01:55:13.249]  When our vitamin D levels go down, our immune system goes down.
[01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:17.193]  And when it goes down, you're vulnerable to all kinds of things going wrong.
[01:55:17.213 --> 01:55:22.519]  Not just virus infections like the flu, but also cancers and many other diseases.
[01:55:24.378 --> 01:55:26.599]  We need vitamin C in that setting as well.
[01:55:26.859 --> 01:55:28.240]  Our diet is crucial.
[01:55:29.161 --> 01:55:30.601]  Real quick, back on vitamin D though.
[01:55:30.881 --> 01:55:34.143]  A lot of people think they can just go out and buy a supplement that's like 400 IUs.
[01:55:34.163 --> 01:55:36.324]  They just take one of those every couple of days and they're covered.
[01:55:36.845 --> 01:55:38.465]  Why is that not enough?
[01:55:38.625 --> 01:55:39.726]  Well, it's totally inadequate.
[01:55:39.806 --> 01:55:42.367]  I mean, our body needs four or five thousand IUs a day.
[01:55:42.588 --> 01:55:50.832]  That's the standard amount and it needs to be taken with food or taken in a liquid that's sublingual or some other way that it gets into the body.
[01:55:51.412 --> 01:55:52.792]  Otherwise, it doesn't absorb well.
[01:55:53.253 --> 01:55:57.414]  And we have an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency that's enormous at this time.
[01:55:58.434 --> 01:56:00.735]  Most people are low in vitamin D levels.
[01:56:00.815 --> 01:56:03.296]  And as I said, immunity goes south at that time.
[01:56:03.736 --> 01:56:06.617]  Yeah, it's like 95% of the population is deficient.
[01:56:06.877 --> 01:56:07.457]  Exactly.
[01:56:07.837 --> 01:56:18.200]  Particularly in the wintertime, where we don't get the UVV rays, which are only present, by the way, in the rest of the seasons between 10 and 2 in the daytime, because there's
[01:56:19.517 --> 01:56:24.301]  And isn't this also just one more symptom of what we might call indoor disease?
[01:56:24.482 --> 01:56:27.424]  Living indoors, working indoors, never getting outside.
[01:56:27.444 --> 01:56:28.886]  You're going to be deficient.
[01:56:28.946 --> 01:56:29.266]  Absolutely.
[01:56:29.286 --> 01:56:37.013]  The human body was made to be outside, and we live in an asphalt jungle, basically, where we just don't get sun.
[01:56:37.073 --> 01:56:40.036]  And it doesn't go through glass, by the way, so you can't get it through the window.
[01:56:40.056 --> 01:56:42.238]  You've got to be out in the sun with your skin exposed.
[01:56:42.793 --> 01:56:47.539]  But then the system tells us that the sun is bad, that the sun is evil.
[01:56:47.679 --> 01:56:51.383]  Listen, too much of anything is no good, okay?
[01:56:51.524 --> 01:56:51.964]  Well, right.
[01:56:51.984 --> 01:56:53.606]  I mean, you don't want to fry yourself, obviously.
[01:56:53.786 --> 01:56:54.367]  That's right.
[01:56:54.407 --> 01:56:58.933]  And it's when you get excessive burning of the skin that you get into problems with the cancer.
[01:56:58.953 --> 01:57:01.356]  But otherwise, vitamin D prevents cancer.
[01:57:01.416 --> 01:57:02.497]  We know a lot of data on that.
[01:57:02.912 --> 01:57:07.434]  Well, but it's also you're more likely to get sunburned if you're deficient in other antioxidants.
[01:57:07.554 --> 01:57:08.114]  There you go.
[01:57:08.174 --> 01:57:09.795]  Sure, you've got to eat a healthy diet.
[01:57:10.035 --> 01:57:10.275]  Right.
[01:57:10.295 --> 01:57:11.216]  People don't realize that.
[01:57:11.336 --> 01:57:14.597]  You need your fruits and vegetables and all those antioxidants are in there.
[01:57:15.297 --> 01:57:15.898]  Absolutely.
[01:57:16.518 --> 01:57:17.238]  Diet's huge.
[01:57:17.338 --> 01:57:18.179]  Sleep's another thing.
[01:57:18.199 --> 01:57:20.520]  If you don't get enough sleep, your immune system goes south.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:27.123]  Miss just four or five hours one night and your natural killer cells, which fight against cancer and viral infections, goes down 30%.
[01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:30.012]  And the same thing with exercise.
[01:57:30.372 --> 01:57:31.253]  Too much, no good.
[01:57:31.474 --> 01:57:32.395]  Not enough, no good.
[01:57:32.815 --> 01:57:35.278]  Gotta exercise on most days for about an hour.
[01:57:35.859 --> 01:57:42.687]  And then we're exposed to all these toxic things in the environment that cause a tremendous suppression of our immune system and the rest of our body.
[01:57:43.697 --> 01:57:46.198]  We got about a minute left, Dr. Saputo.
[01:57:46.558 --> 01:57:49.659]  So to summarize, things that work better than a flu shot, what would you say?
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:50.440]  List.
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:52.781]  Okay, vitamin D, sunshine.
[01:57:53.501 --> 01:57:57.022]  Get your diet where you're eating fruits and vegetables and the healthy things you need.
[01:57:57.923 --> 01:58:01.284]  Exercise, sleep, stress reduction.
[01:58:01.984 --> 01:58:20.222]  Uh, avoidance of toxic exposures, and then there are things like beta-glucans and echinacea, vitamin A, the mushrooms, the maitake and shiitake mushrooms, selenium and zinc, herbs such as olive leaf extract and garlic, the homeopathic remedies, all these things are fantastic and way better than a flu shot.
[01:58:20.702 --> 01:58:20.823]  Yeah.
[01:58:20.843 --> 01:58:24.086]  The people that need the flu shot are people that don't have a good immune system.
[01:58:24.346 --> 01:58:26.128]  They're the last ones that will respond to
[01:58:27.310 --> 01:58:29.672]  Well, and they're also the most likely to be damaged by it.
[01:58:29.732 --> 01:58:36.196]  If your immune system is already weak and you get a flu shot, that's when you're lobotomized because you don't have any defenses against the toxic ingredients.

[01:58:54.101 --> 01:58:58.925]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:59.125 --> 01:59:06.291]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:59:06.431 --> 01:59:11.837]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:59:12.057 --> 01:59:15.801]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:59:48.814 --> 01:59:49.955]  Infowarshop.com
[01:59:54.184 --> 01:59:56.088]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.569 --> 01:59:59.354]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

[02:00:10.710 --> 02:00:11.510]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.311 --> 02:00:13.211]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.831 --> 02:00:17.433]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.013 --> 02:00:22.075]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.915 --> 02:00:29.716]  Alright, we're into hour number three.
[02:00:29.796 --> 02:00:31.497]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:31.557 --> 02:00:32.598]  Yeah, you're in the right place.
[02:00:32.878 --> 02:00:35.300]  And Alex will be back on Monday.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:38.582]  Until then, it's, well, it's the InfoWars crew.
[02:00:39.323 --> 02:00:43.786]  Going to be filling in tomorrow, then we've got Kathryn Albrecht covering on Friday.
[02:00:43.806 --> 02:00:51.371]  I'm not sure when I'll be back, but, you know, whenever Alex wants me, I'll come back in and cover the news for you.
[02:00:52.091 --> 02:00:56.933]  With hopefully a little bit of comedy and satire thrown in there just for some variety.
[02:00:57.013 --> 02:00:58.093]  Can't all be bad news, right?
[02:00:58.213 --> 02:00:59.734]  We've got to have a little bit of fun with it.
[02:00:59.774 --> 02:01:01.574]  Dr. Saputo, would you agree with that?
[02:01:01.594 --> 02:01:04.816]  That we've got to find ways to laugh to keep our immune system healthy?
[02:01:05.156 --> 02:01:05.916]  Absolutely!
[02:01:05.956 --> 02:01:07.076]  Laughter is the best medicine.
[02:01:07.096 --> 02:01:09.597]  Just ask Norman Cousins, the anatomy of an illness.
[02:01:10.458 --> 02:01:13.959]  Our attitude has a huge effect on our biochemistry and physiology.
[02:01:13.979 --> 02:01:17.180]  And if we're laughing, we get that inner smile, it's going to be healthier.
[02:01:18.063 --> 02:01:18.783]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:01:18.823 --> 02:01:26.766]  And even if the news from the real world seems negative and gets you down, you can still have fun with it.
[02:01:26.786 --> 02:01:28.406]  Like, we made fun of the TSA.
[02:01:28.426 --> 02:01:29.667]  That was really funny.
[02:01:29.707 --> 02:01:31.527]  You can find ways to make fun of things.
[02:01:31.827 --> 02:01:34.408]  Yeah, well, laughter is a very good medicine.
[02:01:35.268 --> 02:01:42.251]  Maybe they'll ban laughter, then, because... They'll call it... You know, it's an illegal drug, the FDA says.
[02:01:42.271 --> 02:01:44.631]  When you laugh, your brain produces drugs, does it not?
[02:01:44.651 --> 02:01:45.752]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:01:45.772 --> 02:01:46.512]  You're a funny guy.
[02:01:47.484 --> 02:01:48.024]  But it's true!
[02:01:48.705 --> 02:01:51.787]  If you think about it, your brain is a pharmaceutical factory.
[02:01:51.807 --> 02:01:57.970]  I think on just any given day, you're probably generating about $50,000 worth of free drugs in your own head.
[02:01:58.271 --> 02:01:59.411]  Oh, way more than that.
[02:01:59.451 --> 02:02:02.333]  If we had the drugs that we generate in our body, we're worth trillions.
[02:02:03.414 --> 02:02:04.194]  Yeah, trillions.
[02:02:04.534 --> 02:02:09.357]  Well, maybe that's how we can pay off the national debt, is to turn over our brain drugs.
[02:02:09.658 --> 02:02:13.140]  We can show up at brain drug donation centers and the U.S.
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:16.782]  can export serotonin or something to some other country.
[02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:22.632]  Yeah, well there are only a few thousand neurotransmitters and we know about six or eight of them think we got the cat's meow there.
[02:02:22.913 --> 02:02:26.774]  We surf far off base with our antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs.
[02:02:26.794 --> 02:02:27.375]  It's a joke.
[02:02:27.735 --> 02:02:29.395]  Your smile goes a long way.
[02:02:29.856 --> 02:02:34.478]  Can you imagine them plugging us all in like it's a scene out of The Matrix where they have like tubes coming out of your head?
[02:02:34.498 --> 02:02:38.920]  Yeah, we're harvesting brain drugs from Big Pharma to research more cures.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:40.060]  Do your part.
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:46.043]  Show up and get a brain plug today and have a little like green ribbon that you wear to show, yeah, I'm a brain donor.
[02:02:50.279 --> 02:02:51.980]  Alright, well I promise to be more serious.
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:56.604]  Now, I want to give you a chance to talk about your new book also.
[02:02:56.944 --> 02:02:59.185]  Give us the title and where people can find that, because it's great.
[02:02:59.386 --> 02:03:00.586]  It's called A Return to Healing.
[02:03:00.646 --> 02:03:03.368]  It's about radical health care reform and the future of medicine.
[02:03:03.508 --> 02:03:04.449]  It's on my website.
[02:03:04.489 --> 02:03:08.372]  That's the best price at drsabuto.com, but you can get it on Amazon as well.
[02:03:09.144 --> 02:03:14.565]  It really looks at all the things that you guys talk about all the time in healthcare that are big problems.
[02:03:15.105 --> 02:03:26.687]  It looks at the flaws in medical education, in the big pharmaceutical industry, the World Health Organization, systems that have to do with our training that's a problem, the medical research industry.
[02:03:27.047 --> 02:03:32.808]  So it's looking at all the aspects of healthcare that we need to do a lot of reform on, true reform.
[02:03:33.148 --> 02:03:36.489]  We start looking at lifestyle as our big approach to healing.
[02:03:37.602 --> 02:03:38.543]  What do you think about this news?
[02:03:38.663 --> 02:03:48.830]  A miracle drug for multiple sclerosis has been pirated from the Cordyceps mushroom and turned into a drug that's now being sold for $48,000 per year per patient.
[02:03:49.230 --> 02:03:51.412]  Listen, I think that's great business!
[02:03:53.985 --> 02:03:55.366]  A lot of money on that deal.
[02:03:55.686 --> 02:03:58.707]  First of all, just hype it up as to be something it's not, probably.
[02:03:58.727 --> 02:03:59.167]  Yeah.
[02:03:59.207 --> 02:04:01.348]  And then sell it for a lot of money so people want it.
[02:04:01.749 --> 02:04:08.692]  Then go to the government and see if you can work out some kind of relationship so that we can get this thing paid for by Medicare and insurance companies.
[02:04:09.052 --> 02:04:09.252]  Right.
[02:04:09.312 --> 02:04:10.253]  Man, what a deal!
[02:04:10.553 --> 02:04:15.055]  Yeah, well, they're making money hand over fist with that when all people really need to do is eat the mushroom.
[02:04:16.536 --> 02:04:17.816]  Well, you may need a truckload.
[02:04:17.996 --> 02:04:19.297]  That's not the worst thing.
[02:04:19.946 --> 02:04:20.947]  Yeah, well, it's Cordyceps.
[02:04:20.967 --> 02:04:22.990]  It's got other benefits, but isn't this amazing?
[02:04:23.250 --> 02:04:25.573]  The biopiracy by Big Pharma, it's out of control.
[02:04:25.973 --> 02:04:27.635]  Well, of course it's out of control.
[02:04:27.956 --> 02:04:31.500]  That's why we have direct-to-consumer ads, is to take it further out of control.
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:33.342]  Convince America, right?
[02:04:33.683 --> 02:04:34.964]  With direct-to-consumer ads.
[02:04:35.004 --> 02:04:38.108]  But listen to the words, and you'll go crazy thinking this is
[02:04:38.922 --> 02:04:41.043]  Well, good to have you on, Dr. Saputo.
[02:04:41.083 --> 02:04:44.024]  You're a great guest, a great conversation with you.
[02:04:44.164 --> 02:04:46.625]  So everybody visit drsaputo.com.

[02:07:06.435 --> 02:07:09.937]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:10.297 --> 02:07:12.579]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.759 --> 02:07:18.043]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:18.463 --> 02:07:24.727]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:25.127 --> 02:07:30.691]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:31.111 --> 02:07:34.774]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:07:35.274 --> 02:07:39.258]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:07:45.524 --> 02:07:48.487]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[02:08:21.119 --> 02:08:21.839]  Alright, welcome back.
[02:08:21.899 --> 02:08:27.121]  This is the Alex Jones Show, hour number three here on this Wednesday, March 6, 2013.
[02:08:27.261 --> 02:08:29.602]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[02:08:29.642 --> 02:08:33.223]  He'll be back on Monday, maybe even the Sunday show, I'm not sure.
[02:08:33.323 --> 02:08:34.383]  Probably Monday, I guess.
[02:08:34.603 --> 02:08:35.523]  I guess you'll find out.
[02:08:35.543 --> 02:08:36.604]  We'll all find out together.
[02:08:37.364 --> 02:08:53.921]  In any case, it's been great joining you today and in this segment we're joined by InfoWarrior David Knight who brings us some special reports and then in about half an hour from now Aaron Dykes will come in and join us here in studio with some additional special reports on eugenics and the National Guard.
[02:08:54.422 --> 02:08:56.284]  David, welcome to the broadcast.
[02:08:56.324 --> 02:08:57.465]  Good to be with you here today.
[02:08:57.765 --> 02:08:58.205]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:08:58.766 --> 02:09:02.949]  You know, you were just talking in the last segment about what good medicine laughter is.
[02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:04.971]  So we're going to laugh at the TSA.
[02:09:04.991 --> 02:09:05.531]  Good!
[02:09:05.652 --> 02:09:08.974]  It's going to be kind of some dark comedy because there's some serious issues here.
[02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:12.597]  Well, they give us all kinds of opportunities for satire and comedy.
[02:09:12.637 --> 02:09:13.038]  That's right.
[02:09:13.078 --> 02:09:18.102]  You know, we've got Operation Paul Revere coming up and, you know, ridicule is a really powerful weapon.
[02:09:18.562 --> 02:09:18.782]  Yes.
[02:09:18.902 --> 02:09:20.843]  You guys did that really well on your side.
[02:09:20.863 --> 02:09:22.544]  I love that TSA video you did.
[02:09:22.584 --> 02:09:23.824]  Oh, TSA Help Wanted?
[02:09:23.964 --> 02:09:24.205]  Yeah.
[02:09:24.345 --> 02:09:24.585]  Yeah.
[02:09:24.665 --> 02:09:24.865]  Yeah.
[02:09:24.885 --> 02:09:26.385]  I probably cried when I saw that, you know.
[02:09:26.405 --> 02:09:27.726]  But yeah, the Target Bridge Environment.
[02:09:28.106 --> 02:09:30.667]  And yesterday they were in the news with a lot of incredible stuff.
[02:09:30.947 --> 02:09:32.248]  You know, the sequester's coming up.
[02:09:32.428 --> 02:09:32.588]  Yep.
[02:09:32.948 --> 02:09:42.432]  And Janet Napolitano was telling everybody, look, I'm not trying to scare you, I'm just trying to inform you, but we're going to be furloughing people and you're going to have very long waiting times at the airports, right?
[02:09:42.512 --> 02:09:42.773]  Right.
[02:09:42.813 --> 02:09:43.853]  Turned out to be a total lie.
[02:09:43.993 --> 02:09:50.336]  Right, but two days just before that, they spent $50 million on new uniforms.
[02:09:50.856 --> 02:09:51.956]  $50 million, okay?
[02:09:52.417 --> 02:09:57.719]  And, you know, put that in perspective, they've got, here's some of the numbers, they've got 44,000 employees, right?
[02:09:58.079 --> 02:10:02.401]  So that's $1,136 per uniform.
[02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:02.801]  Wow!
[02:10:03.301 --> 02:10:03.501]  Yeah.
[02:10:03.621 --> 02:10:06.762]  Wow, where do they buy these $1,100 TSA uniforms?
[02:10:06.823 --> 02:10:07.463]  Are they magic?
[02:10:07.483 --> 02:10:10.204]  Do they have, do they make them invisible or something?
[02:10:10.484 --> 02:10:11.485]  That's right, that's right.
[02:10:11.745 --> 02:10:16.068]  Yeah, they're not bulletproof or waterproof or spill-proof, you know, because they're worried about your liquids.
[02:10:16.128 --> 02:10:17.469]  I don't know what it is about it.
[02:10:18.009 --> 02:10:23.593]  And it got me thinking about, well, here's the serious thing, okay, first, before we get into the other thing.
[02:10:23.813 --> 02:10:25.034]  Okay, let's be serious, all right?
[02:10:25.054 --> 02:10:25.755]  Yeah, let's get serious.
[02:10:25.775 --> 02:10:26.215]  About the TSA.
[02:10:26.455 --> 02:10:35.521]  Yeah, so, you know, I'm looking at this, and it's like, okay, if they've got 44,000 employees, okay, there's another article saying that their uniform allowance is $446 per year for these employees.
[02:10:38.143 --> 02:10:40.626]  So that's only about 40% of the cost, right?
[02:10:41.007 --> 02:10:53.142]  So the question is, are they shoveling this money somewhere else or, because this is to be provided over a couple of years, or are they looking to maybe increase the size of the TSA army?
[02:10:53.382 --> 02:10:53.602]  Right?
[02:10:53.823 --> 02:10:55.645]  Oh, right.
[02:10:55.665 --> 02:10:57.888]  Add people.
[02:10:57.928 --> 02:11:01.012]  Maybe they're looking at multiple year use of these things or something.
[02:11:01.032 --> 02:11:07.741]  Well, I think the sequestration, I think we should, instead of cutting people, we should cut the uniforms and let the TSA work naked.
[02:11:08.061 --> 02:11:08.402]  That's right.
[02:11:08.562 --> 02:11:11.726]  And that way we will know that they're not hiding anything in their pants.
[02:11:11.766 --> 02:11:15.429]  That's right, yeah, but these little emperors want us to be unclothed, not them, right?
[02:11:15.529 --> 02:11:16.009]  Apparently.
[02:11:16.029 --> 02:11:21.173]  And the interesting thing about this, and this was in an article, a couple of these things were in articles that were linked on.
[02:11:21.193 --> 02:11:23.935]  Can you imagine those TSA agents naked?
[02:11:24.515 --> 02:11:25.716]  I'm sorry, that's a disturbing image.
[02:11:25.736 --> 02:11:26.357]  I'd rather not.
[02:11:26.677 --> 02:11:27.978]  There are things you should never do.
[02:11:28.098 --> 02:11:29.859]  Never imagine TSA people naked.
[02:11:29.879 --> 02:11:31.981]  Don't pee on the electric fence.
[02:11:32.101 --> 02:11:33.582]  Don't eat the yellow snow.
[02:11:33.642 --> 02:11:35.103]  Things you should never do, basically.
[02:11:35.123 --> 02:11:36.024]  That's right, that's right.
[02:11:37.104 --> 02:11:39.286]  Well, and also, here's another serious thing, okay?
[02:11:39.546 --> 02:11:48.132]  This is a marine lieutenant, combat lieutenant, gets $400 once for uniforms, okay, as an allowance.
[02:11:48.452 --> 02:11:50.994]  These guys are getting $446 per year.
[02:11:51.274 --> 02:11:51.534]  Wow.
[02:11:51.714 --> 02:11:53.555]  And they just doubled that from what they had before.
[02:11:54.036 --> 02:12:00.060]  But to give you an idea of inflation, okay, I thought back, you know, I started thinking about these little emperors running around with their new uniforms and everything.
[02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:02.221]  It made me think back to the Nixon White House.
[02:12:02.281 --> 02:12:02.922]  Do you remember that?
[02:12:02.942 --> 02:12:06.444]  You remember when Nixon had, like, the Imperial Guard uniforms that he had at the White House?
[02:12:07.264 --> 02:12:10.346]  I think I was in diapers at that time.
[02:12:10.466 --> 02:12:11.147]  I remember that.
[02:12:11.207 --> 02:12:12.847]  They made one appearance, okay?
[02:12:13.208 --> 02:12:17.930]  He'd taken a European tour and he was real infatuated with all the pomp and circumstance in Europe, right?
[02:12:17.950 --> 02:12:18.331]  Uh-huh.
[02:12:18.651 --> 02:12:21.412]  So he went out and had uniforms made for the White House staff.
[02:12:21.472 --> 02:12:25.735]  And we've got it, you can't see it on the radio, but we've got a link to it that we can pull up here.
[02:12:26.435 --> 02:12:28.477]  And he got these uniforms for them.
[02:12:28.517 --> 02:12:29.998]  They wore them only once.
[02:12:30.238 --> 02:12:32.940]  And they were so ridiculed that they never wore them again.
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:33.360]  Really?
[02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:33.660]  Yeah.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:36.942]  They were white jackets with black leather caps, okay?
[02:12:37.343 --> 02:12:40.245]  And they had... I've got something here that talks about it.
[02:12:40.485 --> 02:12:41.926]  But you can look at it.
[02:12:41.946 --> 02:12:44.388]  They're white and they look like a marching band uniform.
[02:12:44.408 --> 02:12:47.430]  Can you guys show that for PrisonPlanet.tv members?
[02:12:47.950 --> 02:12:48.991]  Okay, those are the caps.
[02:12:49.031 --> 02:12:49.751]  I see the caps.
[02:12:49.851 --> 02:12:51.553]  Yeah, that's what they actually wound up being.
[02:12:51.573 --> 02:12:55.495]  They actually wound up being a marching band uniform.
[02:12:55.655 --> 02:12:56.436]  Here's the description.
[02:12:56.916 --> 02:13:06.823]  A white cream tunic made out of elastique with a double-breasted cut, three buttons, a stand-up collar, gold nylon trim, and a vinyl cap.
[02:13:06.983 --> 02:13:09.605]  And they had little black leather capes with it as well.
[02:13:09.865 --> 02:13:11.106]  And it had like metal things.
[02:13:11.146 --> 02:13:11.586]  Capes?
[02:13:11.806 --> 02:13:15.369]  Yeah, they had on their collars it said WH for White House and all this kind of stuff.
[02:13:15.569 --> 02:13:17.331]  I think TSA should wear capes.
[02:13:17.351 --> 02:13:21.835]  They're like Superman, running around, reaching down your pants with a cape on.
[02:13:22.155 --> 02:13:22.535]  That's right.
[02:13:22.555 --> 02:13:24.617]  Well, they only cost $95, though.
[02:13:24.998 --> 02:13:26.499]  I mean, they got a deal on those things.
[02:13:26.519 --> 02:13:27.000]  That's a deal.
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:28.681]  And when you look at it, I mean, they're pretty fancy for $95.
[02:13:29.121 --> 02:13:34.987]  Of course, the Feds devalued our currency quite a bit in the intervening 40 years, but these are some of the reviews they got.
[02:13:35.307 --> 02:13:38.170]  Some of the people said they look like late Weimar Republic.
[02:13:38.650 --> 02:13:43.434]  Other people said they look like they're from a Lithuanian movie or they look like Nazi uniforms.
[02:13:44.855 --> 02:13:51.161]  They mothballed these things and ten years later, Alice Cooper tried to buy some of them and they wouldn't sell them.
[02:13:51.481 --> 02:13:56.045]  And they eventually gave them to a Utah college where they used them as marching band uniforms.
[02:13:56.065 --> 02:14:05.913]  So I thought, you know, with all these uniforms that the TSA is buying, you know, at about a hundred people per marching band, they could have about 500 marching bands they could outfit with these silly uniforms.
[02:14:05.933 --> 02:14:12.918]  Well, you know, it seems to me that when you have no real authority, you have to have a really fancy uniform.
[02:14:12.938 --> 02:14:16.460]  That's why, you know, John Cleese did his thing about the Department of Funny Walks?
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:17.160]  That's right.
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.301]  The funny walking.
[02:14:19.642 --> 02:14:29.248]  The more corrupt your government, the more you have to embellish it with crazy little walks, crazy little uniforms, because you don't have any real authority there.
[02:14:29.608 --> 02:14:30.109]  Right, right.
[02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:31.269]  It's all a facade.
[02:14:31.490 --> 02:14:39.334]  And one of the things that they had to agree to when this marching band got it, they had to agree, they had a lot of regulations that the Secret Service gave them.
[02:14:39.495 --> 02:14:49.761]  The Secret Service was very interested that they not sell these things to Alice Cooper, that they would not use them in any way, in a way that would debase the presidency.
[02:14:50.521 --> 02:14:50.822]  Okay?
[02:14:50.942 --> 02:14:56.225]  Now, I looked at that and I thought, well you know, the person who debased the presidency was Richard Nixon.
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:15:01.502]  I mean, he had that kind of pride to think that he needed that kind of pomp for his personal guards.
[02:15:01.562 --> 02:15:07.225]  Yeah, but even, think about it though, in contrast, Richard Nixon didn't even say, yeah, I can drone strike Americans on U.S.
[02:15:07.245 --> 02:15:07.586]  soil.
[02:15:07.766 --> 02:15:08.426]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:15:08.546 --> 02:15:11.447]  I mean, Nixon was mild compared to what we're seeing today.
[02:15:11.468 --> 02:15:13.409]  He was just kind of getting warmed up, you know.
[02:15:13.809 --> 02:15:16.110]  This tyranny kind of rolls out slowly, right?
[02:15:16.270 --> 02:15:17.991]  So he was kind of on the cutting edge, you know.
[02:15:18.391 --> 02:15:22.374]  But maybe he was saying, you know, instead of saying I'm not a crook, maybe he was saying I'm not a kook, you know.
[02:15:22.394 --> 02:15:24.836]  Maybe he was talking about those uniforms, I don't know.
[02:15:25.396 --> 02:15:26.577]  But it just kind of rolls out.
[02:15:26.637 --> 02:15:34.302]  But the other thing that was interesting, I thought, with the TSA is you notice that they're going to start allowing knives and golf clubs and things like that.
[02:15:34.322 --> 02:15:35.083]  I've been waiting for that.
[02:15:35.163 --> 02:15:35.403]  Yeah.
[02:15:35.803 --> 02:15:39.286]  I might start flying again if I can bring a knife on now, a little two-inch blade.
[02:15:39.566 --> 02:15:40.347]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:15:40.847 --> 02:15:44.410]  But now that's only going to be legal in April, you know, the end of April.
[02:15:44.530 --> 02:15:47.832]  If you were to carry on something like that now, you'd be in a lot of trouble.
[02:15:47.912 --> 02:15:48.452]  So what's the deal?
[02:15:48.472 --> 02:15:55.094]  Do all the TSA people now have enough pocket knives that they've confiscated from everybody and now they figure, we just can't handle any more freaking knives!
[02:15:55.574 --> 02:15:56.995]  Legalize them again, for God's sake!
[02:15:57.015 --> 02:15:59.435]  They've got the market on knives and nail clippers, I guess.
[02:15:59.675 --> 02:15:59.995]  Yeah!
[02:16:00.156 --> 02:16:00.576]  I don't know.
[02:16:00.876 --> 02:16:05.717]  Well, the nail clippers, there's no word as to whether or not nail clippers are still a security threat or not.
[02:16:06.237 --> 02:16:07.218]  So, I don't know.
[02:16:07.418 --> 02:16:09.078]  It's that little file part.
[02:16:09.418 --> 02:16:09.658]  Yeah.
[02:16:09.758 --> 02:16:14.600]  You could file off the lock on the door to the flight deck.
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:15.180]  That's right.
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:18.401]  And get in that way with your nail clippers.
[02:16:18.761 --> 02:16:24.082]  What about, I heard they were going to still not allow golf clubs, or a certain number of golf clubs, or what's the deal on that?
[02:16:24.102 --> 02:16:25.322]  Yeah, there was some stuff on this.
[02:16:25.402 --> 02:16:28.743]  It's like, they're not going to allow liquids still, okay?
[02:16:29.343 --> 02:16:35.405]  But you can take lacrosse, billiards and hockey sticks, ski poles, and two golf clubs.
[02:16:35.745 --> 02:16:37.285]  Three would be a danger, I guess.
[02:16:37.465 --> 02:16:38.065]  Two.
[02:16:38.205 --> 02:16:40.006]  One for each hand, basically, is what they're saying.
[02:16:40.386 --> 02:16:42.486]  You can have two clubs, one in each hand.
[02:16:42.747 --> 02:16:43.147]  That's right.
[02:16:43.287 --> 02:16:44.247]  But the third one, nah.
[02:16:44.767 --> 02:16:46.348]  It's all totally arbitrary, right?
[02:16:47.028 --> 02:16:49.610]  But the interesting thing about it, you know where they're getting opposition to that from?
[02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:51.031]  Ah, flight attendants.
[02:16:51.091 --> 02:16:51.591]  Flight attendants.
[02:16:51.611 --> 02:16:51.891]  Yes.
[02:16:51.951 --> 02:16:53.192]  Yes, flight attendants.
[02:16:53.212 --> 02:16:57.635]  Yeah, these people who enforce this kind of bizarre, imaginary world on us.
[02:16:57.695 --> 02:17:01.417]  I think that every time, you know, when they go down, they tell you you've got to turn off your cell phones, right?
[02:17:01.457 --> 02:17:01.817]  You can't.
[02:17:02.117 --> 02:17:06.740]  And they're very explicit about saying that you can't put it in airplane mode.
[02:17:07.834 --> 02:17:08.835]  Oh, they're right.
[02:17:08.935 --> 02:17:11.277]  Do they actually even understand what airplane mode is?
[02:17:12.097 --> 02:17:13.518]  Isn't that off?
[02:17:13.938 --> 02:17:23.365]  Well, the thing is, if you just turn it off like they ask you to, and make the screen go black, your phone is still sending and receiving signals.
[02:17:23.385 --> 02:17:25.126]  It's still working as a radio.
[02:17:25.527 --> 02:17:26.627]  It just doesn't look like it.
[02:17:27.748 --> 02:17:33.630]  And so, but you know, if you actually put it in airplane mode, that shuts off all radio signals.
[02:17:33.930 --> 02:17:34.870]  It's not looking for anything.
[02:17:34.930 --> 02:17:36.031]  It's not sending anything.
[02:17:36.231 --> 02:17:36.451]  Right.
[02:17:36.471 --> 02:17:38.551]  That's why they call it airplane mode.
[02:17:38.651 --> 02:17:39.392]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:17:39.452 --> 02:17:39.792]  Brilliant.
[02:17:39.852 --> 02:17:42.993]  But that doesn't kind of get through to the flight attendants, you know.
[02:17:43.053 --> 02:17:44.233]  They don't really understand that.
[02:17:44.693 --> 02:17:47.854]  And I guess it kind of gets to the point, you know, what this is all about.
[02:17:47.874 --> 02:17:48.855]  It's all about theater.
[02:17:49.295 --> 02:17:50.595]  It's all about appearances.
[02:17:50.875 --> 02:17:51.155]  Sure it is.
[02:17:51.175 --> 02:17:56.217]  So they want your phone to have the appearance of being off, even though it's not really.
[02:17:56.457 --> 02:18:00.359]  Well, it's like they say, you can't bring liquids on the plane, but your body is 75% water.
[02:18:00.479 --> 02:18:01.039]  Right.
[02:18:01.899 --> 02:18:09.463]  So, you know, if a terrorist wanted a little liquid bomb, all they have to do is swallow a little baggie of liquid, go into the bathroom, vomit it back up.
[02:18:09.903 --> 02:18:11.063]  They got their liquid bomb!
[02:18:11.103 --> 02:18:12.224]  I mean, what's the big deal?
[02:18:12.464 --> 02:18:13.004]  Right, right.
[02:18:13.124 --> 02:18:19.227]  Or have a fake breast, you know, prosthetic with liquid in it.
[02:18:20.287 --> 02:18:21.788]  I'm sure I'm not giving terrorists new ideas.
[02:18:21.808 --> 02:18:22.928]  These are kind of obvious things.
[02:18:22.988 --> 02:18:23.528]  Right, right.
[02:18:23.628 --> 02:18:24.709]  This liquid thing is crazy.
[02:18:24.949 --> 02:18:27.890]  Well, it's been security theater for a long time.
[02:18:27.930 --> 02:18:29.270]  Everybody's known it's been theater.
[02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:38.151]  I flew with my sons in 2001 before September 11th, and I told them, I said, this is just the stupidest theater that you've ever seen.
[02:18:38.451 --> 02:18:41.312]  This is all about, you know, a power trip.
[02:18:41.432 --> 02:18:47.453]  It's all about making people think that the government is there to protect them, that the government is going to save them and keep them secure.
[02:18:47.613 --> 02:18:49.773]  And just a few months after that, you know, you had 9-11.
[02:18:49.833 --> 02:18:54.054]  Remember that show, that comedy improv show called Whose Line Is It Anyway?
[02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.771]  No, I don't remember that.
[02:18:55.811 --> 02:18:56.051]  Really?
[02:18:56.732 --> 02:18:59.754]  I remember seeing that, and it was set up improv situations.
[02:19:00.155 --> 02:19:01.175]  I found that this was useful.
[02:19:01.256 --> 02:19:10.003]  Every time before I would go into the airport, I would imagine I'm going to view a Whose Line Is It Anyway show where they're acting like security experts.
[02:19:10.904 --> 02:19:12.145]  And then there's the TSA?
[02:19:12.245 --> 02:19:13.246]  Oh my god, it's so funny.
[02:19:13.566 --> 02:19:14.567]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[02:19:15.107 --> 02:19:18.370]  Well, it's sad, but it's kind of like a dark comedy.
[02:19:19.211 --> 02:19:22.294]  It's kind of like Terry Gilliam's Brazil.
[02:19:22.314 --> 02:19:26.898]  Remember how they had all the monitors where they're watching everybody and all this stuff?
[02:19:26.958 --> 02:19:30.862]  It's this real oppressive and brutal regime, but it doesn't really quite work.
[02:19:30.902 --> 02:19:31.642]  No, it doesn't work.
[02:19:31.682 --> 02:19:32.503]  Massive failures.
[02:19:32.864 --> 02:19:37.007]  I've wondered, too, how does the TSA train itself
[02:19:37.867 --> 02:19:39.508]  To feel down your pants.
[02:19:39.588 --> 02:19:41.309]  Do they pat each other down?
[02:19:42.069 --> 02:19:43.050]  And to get good at it?
[02:19:43.630 --> 02:19:45.091]  Do they work on dummy models?
[02:19:45.191 --> 02:19:46.132]  How do they do that?
[02:19:46.152 --> 02:19:47.152]  Because they're experts.
[02:19:47.292 --> 02:19:48.613]  I don't want to try to visualize that.
[02:19:48.893 --> 02:19:49.814]  Yeah, me neither.
[02:19:49.834 --> 02:19:56.497]  Well anyway, more satire at the TSA's expense, straight ahead right here on the Alex Jones Show with David Knight in studio.
[02:19:56.517 --> 02:19:57.718]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:20:01.215 --> 02:20:02.857]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:20:03.118 --> 02:20:06.623]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:20:06.763 --> 02:20:11.169]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:20:11.329 --> 02:20:15.415]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[02:20:16.977 --> 02:20:21.963]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates we have a discounted at 10% off with promo code water
[02:20:34.878 --> 02:20:51.865]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:20:52.185 --> 02:20:57.508]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filter today at infowarestore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:21:00.964 --> 02:21:05.885]  I travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[02:21:06.025 --> 02:21:15.568]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:21:15.908 --> 02:21:27.851]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:21:28.328 --> 02:21:32.714]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[02:21:33.014 --> 02:21:34.556]  And they're so easy to use.
[02:21:34.796 --> 02:21:36.679]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[02:21:36.699 --> 02:21:40.444]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[02:21:40.904 --> 02:21:42.126]  Fake TV is only $34.95.
[02:21:44.008 --> 02:21:47.452]  Order your FAKE TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to FAKETV.com.
[02:21:47.472 --> 02:21:48.814]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com.
[02:21:48.894 --> 02:21:51.156]  FAKE TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:22:00.427 --> 02:22:04.508]  Now there's an amazing new natural antibiotic every person must have!

[02:22:21.331 --> 02:22:22.111]  Hempusa.org.

[02:22:29.932 --> 02:22:39.198]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:39.258 --> 02:22:39.979]  This capitalism?
[02:22:40.039 --> 02:22:46.183]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:46.323 --> 02:22:47.083]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:47.124 --> 02:22:50.226]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:22:50.286 --> 02:22:51.186]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.206 --> 02:22:52.547]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:22:52.607 --> 02:22:52.887]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.927 --> 02:22:53.208]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.453 --> 02:23:03.996]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:23:04.336 --> 02:23:05.057]  That bears repeating.
[02:23:05.357 --> 02:23:08.901]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:23:09.241 --> 02:23:13.505]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[02:23:13.805 --> 02:23:19.271]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day.
[02:23:19.651 --> 02:23:21.852]  Pro-EM1 is dairy, wheat, and soy free.
[02:23:22.112 --> 02:23:24.373]  Contains all natural and certified organic ingredients.
[02:23:24.613 --> 02:23:26.514]  Contains no preservatives or animal products.
[02:23:26.774 --> 02:23:28.715]  Supports a healthy digestive and immune system.
[02:23:28.855 --> 02:23:29.595]  Supports weight loss.
[02:23:29.875 --> 02:23:31.396]  Improves absorption of food nutrients.
[02:23:31.676 --> 02:23:33.077]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.
[02:23:33.337 --> 02:23:34.577]  Is never freeze-dried.
[02:23:34.917 --> 02:23:38.779]  And uses three groups of live, viable, beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.
[02:23:39.139 --> 02:23:42.580]  Order Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse at Terragonics.com.

[02:23:49.642 --> 02:23:50.722]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[02:24:16.061 --> 02:24:17.763]  Alright, we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:17.803 --> 02:24:19.504]  Thanks for listening in.
[02:24:19.544 --> 02:24:22.627]  This is the third hour of today's broadcast on this Wednesday.
[02:24:22.647 --> 02:24:24.108]  Still Wednesday, yeah?
[02:24:24.268 --> 02:24:25.789]  March 6th, 2013.
[02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:29.473]  Mike Adams filling in here with David Knight in studio.
[02:24:29.813 --> 02:24:31.074]  And we're talking about the TSA.
[02:24:31.134 --> 02:24:33.516]  Actually, we're making fun of the TSA.
[02:24:33.856 --> 02:24:37.599]  But what do you think about the notion, David, that when you go on a flight...
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:40.782]  You are, in effect, submitting to be a prisoner.
[02:24:40.802 --> 02:24:41.302]  Yeah.
[02:24:41.383 --> 02:24:46.547]  For the entire duration, from when you check in to when you get off the plane, you're a prisoner.
[02:24:46.807 --> 02:24:47.768]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:47.888 --> 02:24:48.608]  It's a police state.
[02:24:48.688 --> 02:24:49.889]  And it's a silly police state.
[02:24:49.929 --> 02:24:54.073]  Like I was talking about, you know, they don't really understand even how cell phones work, right?
[02:24:54.093 --> 02:24:57.656]  And you stop and think about it, that's another thing, too, about the 9-11 narrative.
[02:24:57.716 --> 02:25:05.622]  I mean, if you understand how cell phones work, you know that nobody was calling and talking to somebody at a call station for a very long time, right?
[02:25:05.822 --> 02:25:08.744]  It's such an obvious hole in the official story.
[02:25:08.924 --> 02:25:09.445]  Right, right.
[02:25:09.505 --> 02:25:21.754]  If anybody's ever tried to make a cell phone call from their phone, they pretty much know that because the cell phone towers have an antenna pattern that deliberately is focusing the energy horizontally, not vertically.
[02:25:22.214 --> 02:25:28.199]  And you'll be passing through the cell phone cells so quickly that they couldn't switch to keep up with you.
[02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:40.403]  Right, so I mean there's a lot of different issues here but yeah it just doesn't work and that's why they put Wi-Fi and they put phone service on the planes because your phones and your Wi-Fi doesn't work on a plane.
[02:25:41.103 --> 02:25:48.726]  But you know it's the whole thing is silly from the start to the finish and like we were talking about during the break we just don't travel that much anymore.
[02:25:48.806 --> 02:25:49.568]  We try to avoid it.
[02:25:49.608 --> 02:25:51.131]  You, you know, you avoid it totally.
[02:25:51.231 --> 02:25:56.020]  I've got family still in North Carolina, so I can't completely avoid it.
[02:25:56.141 --> 02:26:00.168]  And I've done more traveling in the last few months than I've done in a decade.
[02:26:01.072 --> 02:26:06.516]  Well the thing is, I would love to have an airline called Open Carry Airlines.
[02:26:06.816 --> 02:26:07.016]  Yeah.
[02:26:07.216 --> 02:26:09.818]  Where to get on the plane, you gotta bring a gun.
[02:26:09.838 --> 02:26:11.480]  That's right.
[02:26:12.140 --> 02:26:18.004]  I'd be on there with veterans, and cops, FBI agents, and concealed carry citizens.
[02:26:18.324 --> 02:26:19.285]  I'd bring my Glock.
[02:26:19.846 --> 02:26:21.166]  We should all be armed.
[02:26:21.187 --> 02:26:23.128]  You think a terrorist is going to get on a plane like that?
[02:26:23.308 --> 02:26:23.528]  No!
[02:26:23.768 --> 02:26:24.169]  No way!
[02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:27.112]  The only requirement is you've got to bring frangible ammo, that's it.
[02:26:27.652 --> 02:26:31.396]  They check your ammo at the gate, here, frangible ammo, get on the plane.
[02:26:31.416 --> 02:26:33.177]  It'll be the safest plane in the sky!
[02:26:33.517 --> 02:26:38.082]  That'll never happen, because remember when they banned cigarette smoking.
[02:26:38.502 --> 02:26:38.702]  Yeah.
[02:26:38.742 --> 02:26:38.902]  Right?
[02:26:39.263 --> 02:26:39.523]  Okay.
[02:26:39.563 --> 02:26:40.184]  Which I agree with.
[02:26:40.224 --> 02:26:42.026]  I don't want to breathe other people's smoke on the plane.
[02:26:42.166 --> 02:26:42.346]  Right.
[02:26:42.446 --> 02:26:42.907]  I don't either.
[02:26:43.227 --> 02:26:47.271]  But some people talked about, you know, having plane flights where they were just going to be all smoking.
[02:26:47.371 --> 02:26:47.792]  Oh yeah.
[02:26:47.812 --> 02:26:48.552]  They can have that.
[02:26:48.633 --> 02:26:48.873]  Sure.
[02:26:48.913 --> 02:26:50.735]  You know, but they won't allow that, right?
[02:26:50.895 --> 02:26:51.055]  Yeah.
[02:26:51.075 --> 02:26:54.138]  You know, they used to have, before they did that, you had some airlines.
[02:26:54.158 --> 02:26:58.483]  I remember there was one airline that used to have a Texas run called Muse Air.
[02:26:58.883 --> 02:27:06.189]  It was a spin-off, some executives from Southwest, and they had flights where there was no smoking, you know, for these short flights.
[02:27:06.489 --> 02:27:09.291]  So they knew there was a market for people who didn't want smoking.
[02:27:09.311 --> 02:27:12.413]  Well, there was also a market for people who wanted smoking all the time.
[02:27:12.513 --> 02:27:13.054]  Right, right.
[02:27:13.154 --> 02:27:14.515]  They won't allow even that.
[02:27:14.595 --> 02:27:15.135]  That's crazy.
[02:27:15.155 --> 02:27:16.977]  It's just the way the nanny state is.
[02:27:17.017 --> 02:27:17.917]  See, I'm all about choice.
[02:27:18.578 --> 02:27:22.040]  You know, if you want to smoke on the airplane, that's fine.
[02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:24.462]  If you want to have an all-smoking flight, they should allow that.
[02:27:25.563 --> 02:27:28.884]  Well, I mean, look at Bloomberg's nanny state in New York, right?
[02:27:29.264 --> 02:27:31.745]  You know, you can't smoke inside your barbershop, right?
[02:27:31.785 --> 02:27:38.767]  So they've had some guys actually get loitering tickets for going outside of their own barbershop while they're waiting for somebody to come in.
[02:27:39.007 --> 02:27:45.309]  They go outside their own barbershop and light up a cigarette and stand there in front of their barbershop and then the cop gives them a ticket for loitering.
[02:27:45.629 --> 02:27:46.209]  That's crazy.
[02:27:46.229 --> 02:27:47.530]  Yeah, it's New York.
[02:27:48.130 --> 02:27:51.912]  I think New York should have a Department of Mental Hygiene like we have in Maryland.
[02:27:52.213 --> 02:27:53.253]  No, I just learned today.
[02:27:53.854 --> 02:27:55.635]  It's a Department of Mental Hygiene.
[02:27:55.915 --> 02:27:58.536]  Do you think Bloomberg could pass the inspection?
[02:27:58.556 --> 02:27:59.597]  Yeah, well, no.
[02:27:59.677 --> 02:28:00.598]  See, but that's the thing.
[02:28:00.818 --> 02:28:03.039]  You notice they don't give drug tests to members of Congress.
[02:28:03.599 --> 02:28:07.602]  You don't even have to pass a constitutional proficiency test to get into the Senate.
[02:28:07.882 --> 02:28:08.602]  Right, right.
[02:28:08.722 --> 02:28:11.044]  You don't even have to know what the Bill of Rights is at all.
[02:28:11.224 --> 02:28:12.625]  And for all we know, they can't read, right?
[02:28:12.665 --> 02:28:14.946]  Because they obviously read the bills.
[02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:16.387]  They have to pass them to find out what's in them.
[02:28:16.607 --> 02:28:18.928]  I think half of them are psyched out on psych drugs.
[02:28:19.848 --> 02:28:23.510]  I think they're on, you know, all kinds of drugs that inhibit their cognitive function.
[02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:25.891]  We should drug test Congress, that's what I'm saying.
[02:28:25.931 --> 02:28:26.171]  Yeah.
[02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:26.551]  Yeah.
[02:28:26.951 --> 02:28:32.294]  Well, there's also that, you know, that green money that, you know, kind of messes up the way they think too, you know.
[02:28:32.494 --> 02:28:34.034]  Yeah, the... Something of a drug to them.
[02:28:34.074 --> 02:28:34.915]  The ultimate addiction.
[02:28:35.075 --> 02:28:35.315]  Yeah.
[02:28:35.515 --> 02:28:35.955]  Cash!
[02:28:36.315 --> 02:28:36.736]  That's right.
[02:28:36.896 --> 02:28:37.736]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:28:37.756 --> 02:28:39.797]  Those guys, they definitely go for that.
[02:28:40.017 --> 02:28:40.257]  I think so.
[02:28:56.287 --> 02:28:59.050]  Yeah, we're doing a routine check-up here.
[02:28:59.070 --> 02:29:00.991]  We're going to be sitting here for a few minutes.
[02:29:01.011 --> 02:29:02.373]  And they always blame it on the control tower.
[02:29:02.713 --> 02:29:03.093]  That's right.
[02:29:03.153 --> 02:29:06.617]  The control tower told us to waste six hours of your time.
[02:29:07.077 --> 02:29:07.537]  That's right.
[02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:09.119]  It's the control tower's fault.
[02:29:09.319 --> 02:29:09.639]  That's right.
[02:29:09.659 --> 02:29:10.680]  There's never any problem here.
[02:29:10.961 --> 02:29:11.961]  Right.
[02:29:12.242 --> 02:29:13.042]  Isn't that Obama, though?
[02:29:13.062 --> 02:29:14.003]  There's never any problem.
[02:29:14.023 --> 02:29:14.204]  Yeah.
[02:29:14.444 --> 02:29:14.724]  Oh, yeah.
[02:29:14.984 --> 02:29:15.385]  Absolutely.
[02:29:16.245 --> 02:29:24.187]  Yeah, we've got a sequestration problem, but we can still spend $50 million on uniforms, and we can send $250 million to Egypt, or whatever.
[02:29:24.827 --> 02:29:27.808]  They can find the money to do what they want to do.
[02:29:28.248 --> 02:29:35.710]  But they're going to release criminals onto the streets to threaten the population at the same time, because that's what they do.
[02:29:35.730 --> 02:29:36.350]  Well, it's incredible.
[02:29:36.410 --> 02:29:37.610]  David Knight, great to have you on.
[02:29:38.290 --> 02:29:38.730]  Thanks, Mike.
[02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:39.290]  All right.
[02:29:39.511 --> 02:29:40.051]  Good to have you here.
[02:29:40.091 --> 02:29:40.811]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:29:40.871 --> 02:29:43.892]  We'll be right back after this break with Aaron Dykes in studio.
[02:29:43.932 --> 02:29:45.073]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:45.113 --> 02:29:45.813]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.474 --> 02:29:51.355]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.855 --> 02:29:53.456]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.396 --> 02:29:57.057]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.676 --> 02:30:05.179]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[02:30:05.459 --> 02:30:08.541]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[02:30:08.721 --> 02:30:11.143]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[02:30:11.523 --> 02:30:13.465]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[02:30:13.665 --> 02:30:16.507]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[02:31:01.895 --> 02:31:07.737]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:31:08.641 --> 02:31:14.544]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[02:31:15.405 --> 02:31:25.470]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[02:31:26.350 --> 02:31:29.652]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:31:30.492 --> 02:31:36.676]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:31:37.416 --> 02:31:47.840]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.
[02:31:48.660 --> 02:31:56.383]  Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver based products are best for you.
[02:31:57.424 --> 02:32:00.365]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[02:32:01.391 --> 02:32:08.257]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[02:32:08.417 --> 02:32:12.940]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[02:32:13.060 --> 02:32:23.569]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[02:32:23.849 --> 02:32:37.425]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers, using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[02:32:38.886 --> 02:32:39.527]  I think so.
[02:33:01.556 --> 02:33:03.957]  You've heard it here, I'm on television, so everybody knows it.
[02:33:04.297 --> 02:33:05.437]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[02:33:05.737 --> 02:33:08.838]  I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.
[02:33:09.098 --> 02:33:14.200]  We're going to find the people who are doing this, take them out, and shoot them.
[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:18.961]  No, you take them out, they are traitors to this country, and shoot them.
[02:33:19.341 --> 02:33:19.962]  Shoot them dead.
[02:33:20.402 --> 02:33:21.282]  I'll pay for the bullet.
[02:33:21.402 --> 02:33:27.384]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[02:33:27.624 --> 02:33:28.304]  I'd love to see that.
[02:33:28.464 --> 02:33:29.225]  In uniform.
[02:33:36.368 --> 02:33:38.151]  I will not take your shotgun away.
[02:33:39.553 --> 02:33:41.295]  I will not take your rifle away.
[02:33:42.657 --> 02:33:45.001]  I won't take your handgun away.
[02:33:45.041 --> 02:33:47.044]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[02:33:59.224 --> 02:33:59.886]  All right, we're back.
[02:34:00.547 --> 02:34:02.452]  Great, uh, great liner there.
[02:34:02.472 --> 02:34:06.883]  A compilation of tyranny that's happening right now in the United States in 2013.
[02:34:09.454 --> 02:34:18.957]  Well, we're going to turn this around, folks, and coming at you from the headquarters of the organization, InfoWars, that is spearheading the effort to turn this around.
[02:34:18.977 --> 02:34:20.597]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:21.117 --> 02:34:22.238]  Mike Adams filling in today.
[02:34:22.258 --> 02:34:28.559]  Aaron Dykes now joins us in studio with updated information, some good stuff from Aaron.
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:34.541]  And to start off with, what's going on with Rand Paul and his attempted filibuster right now?
[02:34:34.721 --> 02:34:42.008]  Well, as you know, they put forward John Brennan, one of Obama's key advisors, who actually creates the drone kill list and brings it to Obama's desk each week.
[02:34:42.348 --> 02:34:43.990]  He's being nominated for CIA.
[02:34:44.310 --> 02:34:51.958]  And so Rand Paul is filibustering right now in the Senate that nomination and saying he wants the Obama administration to promise not to kill American drones.
[02:34:52.518 --> 02:34:54.160]  We've got a report up on InfoWars.
[02:34:54.540 --> 02:34:58.224]  Government emergency alert test interrupts the Rand Paul filibuster.
[02:34:58.664 --> 02:35:10.346]  That's interesting because of all the sneaky tactics we saw during the Ron Paul run for the campaign, all the blacking out in the media, sometimes physically blacking out the transmission of his speech.
[02:35:10.826 --> 02:35:18.788]  It's interesting that the state of New York would issue an EAS alert over his filibuster, though I have also seen it on CNN, but interesting he's doing that.
[02:35:18.988 --> 02:35:23.149]  Just to interrupt things, but why wouldn't Obama just say, okay,
[02:35:24.249 --> 02:35:27.170]  We're not going to kill Americans on U.S.
[02:35:27.210 --> 02:35:27.510]  soil.
[02:35:27.550 --> 02:35:33.031]  Why wouldn't he just be willing to put that language in there if that's what he's claiming he's never going to do?
[02:35:33.451 --> 02:35:35.352]  Oh, well look at the whole structure they've created.
[02:35:35.372 --> 02:35:38.153]  The new terrorist could be a domestic extremist.
[02:35:38.393 --> 02:35:39.633]  Might be a returning vet.
[02:35:39.693 --> 02:35:42.214]  Might just be a crazy constitutionalist with a flag.
[02:35:42.534 --> 02:35:47.955]  Might just be a curmudgeonly old man with a shotgun who doesn't want government putting in a spark meter or something.
[02:35:48.035 --> 02:35:52.779]  Hey, it might be an eight-year-old student with a strawberry tart shaped like a gun.
[02:35:52.799 --> 02:35:53.479]  Oh, I forgot.
[02:35:53.639 --> 02:35:54.600]  That's most dangerous.
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:57.482]  Actually, we're about to get to a special report at the very end.
[02:35:57.662 --> 02:35:58.063]  Oh, really?
[02:35:58.143 --> 02:36:01.645]  I caught a very young terrorist still in a stroller with a bubble gun.
[02:36:01.685 --> 02:36:03.587]  That's something that's really going to work out.
[02:36:03.607 --> 02:36:05.068]  He was just rapid-firing.
[02:36:05.088 --> 02:36:06.269]  He had... Bubbles.
[02:36:06.589 --> 02:36:08.971]  He had hundreds of bubble bullets in his chamber.
[02:36:09.011 --> 02:36:12.714]  Does the TSA allow bubble guns on airplanes anymore or ever?
[02:36:12.894 --> 02:36:13.975]  That's probably liquid, right?
[02:36:14.035 --> 02:36:14.275]  I doubt it.
[02:36:14.295 --> 02:36:15.316]  Oh, that's a liquid!
[02:36:15.596 --> 02:36:16.197]  The bubbles!
[02:36:16.897 --> 02:36:18.961]  Plus it might look like something, you know.
[02:36:19.261 --> 02:36:20.263]  Yeah, like bubbles.
[02:36:20.583 --> 02:36:28.557]  Well, I'm really worried about the strawberry tart guns because they could shoot strawberry seeds, which I understand are quite small, and could poke out an eye.
[02:36:30.009 --> 02:36:44.577]  And it's part of this whole Orwellian 1984 Big Brother system where the perception is reality and everyone has to tattle on each other and basically even the thought, they had literal everything but literal invasion of the mind.
[02:36:44.897 --> 02:36:49.040]  But any sign that you're thinking of resistance, that itself is a crime, that's a thought crime.
[02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:51.401]  Well that gets us to the issue of mental hygiene.
[02:36:51.821 --> 02:36:52.101]  Yeah.
[02:36:52.162 --> 02:36:53.943]  Which we mentioned that in the first hour.
[02:36:53.963 --> 02:36:55.925]  Freaked me out, but yeah, go ahead.
[02:36:55.965 --> 02:36:59.890]  Mental hygiene, but that is one of the key code words from the eugenics movement.
[02:36:59.910 --> 02:37:07.858]  It goes back to the founding, but basically they wanted to use the idea that there's crazy people and they might be reproducing faster than regular people.
[02:37:08.018 --> 02:37:08.278]  No.
[02:37:08.338 --> 02:37:11.520]  Mentally unfit people, what they called feeble-minded people.
[02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:13.761]  But most of this was code word.
[02:37:13.781 --> 02:37:28.609]  Of course, there were some messed up people, but they really want an excuse for the state to decide who lives and dies, which really brings us up to modern day socialized healthcare, where they want to rationalize it and say, well, your end of life care might cost a million dollars plus.
[02:37:28.969 --> 02:37:29.890]  That's not worth it.
[02:37:29.930 --> 02:37:32.291]  Your life isn't of value, so we want to terminate you.
[02:37:32.631 --> 02:37:38.435]  That abortion's to a minority mother or someone who already has too many children, so that life isn't worth it.
[02:37:38.735 --> 02:37:46.221]  And that's very much the mentality of eugenics, but it itself is part of what George Orwell actually calls oligarchical collectivism.
[02:37:46.881 --> 02:37:51.904]  Remember Goldstein the Rebel in 1984, who actually helped establish that Big Brother system?
[02:37:52.325 --> 02:37:56.428]  He writes the book on the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism.
[02:37:57.068 --> 02:37:59.831]  And what this is is socialism in disguise.
[02:38:12.005 --> 02:38:20.012]  The writing of Fabian Socialist, who was also a eugenicist, was playwright George Bernard Shaw, very famous for Pygmalion and some of his other works.
[02:38:20.352 --> 02:38:34.845]  He wrote that under socialism, which remembers any form of oligarchical collectivism run by the elites, but where everyone's trapped in the society, socialism, you'd be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught, and employed whether you liked it or not.
[02:38:35.305 --> 02:38:41.691]  But if it were discovered you had not the character and industry to be worth all this trouble, you might be executed in a kindly manner.
[02:38:41.912 --> 02:38:42.792]  In a kindly manner?
[02:38:43.013 --> 02:38:45.075]  Is that a drone strike system?
[02:38:45.115 --> 02:38:46.796]  Is that a New World Order system in action?
[02:38:47.097 --> 02:38:51.661]  I think the drone strikes are kindly because the missile arrives before you hear it.
[02:38:52.201 --> 02:38:54.524]  Therefore, there is no fear involved.
[02:38:54.974 --> 02:38:57.055]  Because they fly faster than the speed of sound, right?
[02:38:57.115 --> 02:38:59.736]  So you're blown up before you can even sense it.
[02:38:59.756 --> 02:39:01.837]  That's compassionate government.
[02:39:01.937 --> 02:39:02.957]  Oh, it's compassionate.
[02:39:03.117 --> 02:39:15.542]  But just to get back into eugenics and mental hygiene, you had the case in, I believe, 1927, where they were saying, we have to sterilize these imbeciles, these feeble-minded, retarded minds who can't think for themselves.
[02:39:15.842 --> 02:39:21.824]  And there was actually a Supreme Court ruling from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who wrote in the deciding
[02:39:22.424 --> 02:39:51.053]  uh... principle of the time quote the principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes which of course is compulsory sterilization and he said that i'll say in that decision three generations of imbeciles is enough and that's completely and fitting with why they have established departments of health and mental hygiene uh... which are implements of the eugenics movement while and it completely fits in where the rockefeller family
[02:39:51.593 --> 02:40:08.779]  Pushed all the vehicles for eugenics, but also established our modern science and our modern hospitals and our modern healthcare system, the allopathic medicine, where you have to have surgeries and pharmaceuticals for everything, staying away from anything that can't be trademarked and found in nature, basically.
[02:40:09.119 --> 02:40:17.422]  Well, if this eugenics effort was thrust upon us, you know, many generations ago, and it was so intense, it seems like
[02:40:19.079 --> 02:40:22.021]  It didn't work because we have more.
[02:40:22.261 --> 02:40:29.506]  It seems like the people running the country are now the most intellectually, you know, cognitively impaired of all.
[02:40:29.586 --> 02:40:37.912]  It's like they got in instead of... Eugenics was saying they want to kill people who don't have high IQs, but now it's like let's put them in office.
[02:40:38.012 --> 02:40:41.374]  High IQs and mental capacity was the language of Eugenics.
[02:40:41.394 --> 02:40:45.337]  The actual system was about classifying people into classes.
[02:40:45.397 --> 02:40:48.759]  I mean, they wanted to protect the elites and propagate their dominance.
[02:40:49.099 --> 02:40:49.259]  Right.
[02:40:49.279 --> 02:40:56.206]  They have an excuse to eliminate their competition, and in particular, many of them are racist and wanted to keep the black population down.
[02:40:56.626 --> 02:41:11.119]  You later saw the Population Council, the United Nations Population Fund, doing really heavy-handed family planning in the third world, where they do the most brutal things to people in India and China and all these other third world developing nations.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.181]  Yeah, you know, North Korea will give you a nuclear family.
[02:41:13.982 --> 02:41:15.043]  They're working on that.
[02:41:15.063 --> 02:41:15.303]  I know.
[02:41:15.423 --> 02:41:16.023]  Technology.
[02:41:16.404 --> 02:41:21.687]  But listen, the main idea... Sorry, I just have to... I'm sorry, I can't be serious today, Aaron.
[02:41:21.707 --> 02:41:23.369]  It's just, it's too insane for me.
[02:41:23.629 --> 02:41:25.950]  Alex calls it gallows humor, but, uh, you know.
[02:41:27.471 --> 02:41:37.598]  So what is, what do you think, from your research, because you research this more than anybody I know, what is the ultimate mechanism for population control that they're going to rain down upon us now?
[02:41:37.698 --> 02:41:39.720]  Or is it already here with GMOs and vaccines?
[02:41:40.194 --> 02:41:42.516]  I think that's one of their main vehicles, for sure, the soft kill.
[02:41:42.796 --> 02:41:46.479]  You've got technocrats like Bill Gates on the cutting edge of that.
[02:41:46.519 --> 02:41:50.803]  He's pushing worldwide with, mind you, the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:41:50.823 --> 02:41:58.409]  They're working in lockstep to push vaccines everywhere, some of which carry covert birth control maneuvers.
[02:41:58.769 --> 02:42:02.650]  Recruiting pregnancies, causing miscarriages, causing infertility.
[02:42:02.970 --> 02:42:07.192]  And then the other side, he's pushing very heavy-handedly GMOs.
[02:42:07.232 --> 02:42:09.112]  He's got major Monsanto stock.
[02:42:09.753 --> 02:42:16.175]  Companies like McDonald's and so forth are interlocked with his holdings and with the board of directories with Monsanto.
[02:42:16.575 --> 02:42:23.417]  And that again works with Rockefeller, who in the 70s created what they called the Green Revolution, but it also centralized food production.
[02:42:24.738 --> 02:42:26.720]  Well, you mentioned vaccines.
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:28.402]  Vaccines are birth control.
[02:42:28.823 --> 02:42:30.204]  I mean, vaccines are abortions.
[02:42:31.065 --> 02:42:32.907]  They cause spontaneous abortions.
[02:42:33.688 --> 02:42:34.829]  And so do GMOs.
[02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:37.773]  In the rat studies.
[02:42:39.394 --> 02:42:41.417]  Isn't Bill Gates in town here in Austin right now?
[02:42:41.977 --> 02:42:44.200]  Yeah, he's here today for South by Southwest, I think.
[02:42:44.565 --> 02:42:47.366]  Is he feeding people, GMO?
[02:42:47.906 --> 02:42:48.427]  What's he doing?
[02:42:48.727 --> 02:42:50.047]  Is he handing out cheeseburgers?
[02:42:50.948 --> 02:42:54.269]  You know, those elites, they don't eat GMOs themselves.
[02:42:54.309 --> 02:42:55.990]  They're very meticulous.
[02:42:56.030 --> 02:43:04.533]  The Rockefeller family owns their own personal organic farm and has their own personal organic chefs who prepare food and supply their personal family of food.
[02:43:04.954 --> 02:43:09.976]  You find the same kind of thing with Chinese elites, with the Queen, the royal families, Bill Gates.
[02:43:10.116 --> 02:43:12.937]  These people don't eat what they're pushing to the mainstream.
[02:43:13.698 --> 02:43:14.458]  Put that back on, guys.
[02:43:14.478 --> 02:43:14.919]  Check this out.
[02:43:14.959 --> 02:43:15.359]  Here's the news.
[02:43:15.419 --> 02:43:17.541]  Melissa Melton, story on InfoWars.com.
[02:43:17.581 --> 02:43:22.446]  Bill Gates descends on Austin in controlled, pre-planned appearance.
[02:43:23.106 --> 02:43:24.127]  Well, I mean, versus what?
[02:43:24.147 --> 02:43:26.329]  A spontaneous appearance?
[02:43:26.770 --> 02:43:33.956]  But Bill Gates is going to be at the Dell Computer Science Hall at the University of Texas speaking to students
[02:43:34.967 --> 02:43:38.512]  No doubt telling them to abort their babies with more vaccines.
[02:43:39.112 --> 02:43:43.258]  Hey, let's shift topics because Alex really wanted me to get to this special report.
[02:43:43.358 --> 02:43:43.838]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:43:43.858 --> 02:43:44.639]  Yeah, go for it.
[02:43:44.659 --> 02:43:49.746]  We've had a public event seeing National Guard, Texas State Guard popping up all over the place.
[02:43:50.106 --> 02:43:53.087]  They were at the Kite Festival, which is otherwise this happy family event.
[02:43:53.467 --> 02:43:56.187]  Alex saw them at a Texas Independence Day celebration.
[02:43:56.527 --> 02:43:59.968]  They'll do crowd control, parking, street control at different events.
[02:44:00.328 --> 02:44:01.448]  And the question is why?
[02:44:01.468 --> 02:44:14.711]  And the bottom line, I tried to point out the history in the special report, but they've perverted what was supposed to be our state militias and allowed them to be over-federalized and used by the president and the centralized, federalized government branch.
[02:44:15.071 --> 02:44:20.035]  Because they had one loophole in the Constitution for when you could use military domestically on our soil.
[02:44:20.435 --> 02:44:23.577]  And that was to repel invasions and to put down insurrections.
[02:44:23.958 --> 02:44:28.361]  They were thinking about things like the Shays Rebellion that happened after the Revolution but before the Constitution.
[02:44:28.821 --> 02:44:35.466]  But in our modern day, they perverted that loophole over insurrections and used it to be any national emergency.
[02:44:35.786 --> 02:44:37.968]  Natural disasters, terrorism, incidents.
[02:44:38.268 --> 02:44:39.408]  And so under U.S.
[02:44:39.488 --> 02:44:53.593]  NORTHCOM, and under laws they've passed, including John Warner Defense Act, since that time, they've transformed more and more of the state guards, as well as the National Guard, into federal hands, and allowed the President to take total control of the emergency.
[02:44:53.613 --> 02:44:54.153]  Okay, let's roll it.
[02:44:54.553 --> 02:44:55.013]  Let's roll it.
[02:44:56.129 --> 02:44:58.131]  Aaron Dykes here for InfoWars.com.
[02:44:58.451 --> 02:45:02.995]  We've got to ask ourselves, why are the Feds preparing for a war against Americans?
[02:45:03.356 --> 02:45:13.305]  Why have they bought now more than 2 billion bullets, all kinds of arms and ammunition, and now more than 2,700 tanks to patrol in America and keep order?
[02:45:13.645 --> 02:45:15.266]  We're told it's because they love us.
[02:45:15.386 --> 02:45:16.948]  We're told it's to keep the peace.
[02:45:17.526 --> 02:45:19.127]  And to increase safety.
[02:45:19.487 --> 02:45:34.235]  But of course, we also know from Army documents, from Homeland Security reports, and a lot of other information, that it's really to occupy America and prepare for a civil unrest and a total economic collapse that will include gun confiscation.
[02:45:34.255 --> 02:45:40.198]  Gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[02:45:40.518 --> 02:45:51.761]  Now the founders who set up the Constitution and Bill of Rights did not want a standing army because they knew history and they knew that over and over again that's how power corrupts and takes over societies.
[02:45:52.161 --> 02:45:58.503]  At the same time they were concerned about historical examples like the Shays Rebellion that happened after the years of the revolution
[02:45:58.883 --> 02:46:04.907]  But before the Constitution, where soldiers who weren't paid formed mobs to try to take over the government.
[02:46:05.307 --> 02:46:12.712]  So, they put in the possibility for the army to be used domestically for only one purpose, and that's to put down insurrections.
[02:46:13.132 --> 02:46:24.299]  This was strengthened through things like Posse Comitatus from 1878, strictly forbidding military from working with police or doing domestic operations, but that is whittled away
[02:46:24.699 --> 02:46:24.879]  I'm good.
[02:46:40.276 --> 02:46:50.320]  We've of course seen how the military has been drilling, preparing, and training to take on Americans, put them in internment camps, and otherwise occupy the domestic sphere of society.
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:56.082]  Alex documented it as early as his Police State 2000 film and in many of his other films.
[02:46:56.122 --> 02:47:00.784]  Here's a short clip where Americans come to checkpoints and beg for help from the military.
[02:47:03.211 --> 02:47:03.652]  I think?
[02:47:15.525 --> 02:47:17.186]  Attention, attention, attention.
[02:47:17.346 --> 02:47:19.948]  American forces are here to help.
[02:47:19.968 --> 02:47:20.768]  Remain calm.
[02:47:20.848 --> 02:47:23.790]  We will not tolerate civil disobedience.
[02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:27.372]  But it's in no way limited to the things that Alex has just put in his films.
[02:47:27.712 --> 02:47:30.633]  This has been an ongoing effort that has been accelerating.
[02:47:31.214 --> 02:47:44.541]  David Knight did a special report just a few weeks ago documenting only a few of the recent urban warfare drills, many of which included helicopters firing simulated live rounds over major American cities.
[02:47:44.941 --> 02:47:48.688]  They include Houston, Miami, Minneapolis, St.
[02:47:48.749 --> 02:47:52.475]  Louis, Chicago, Los Angeles and other locales.
[02:47:52.930 --> 02:47:54.931]  Well, let's take a look at some of these recent drills.
[02:47:55.111 --> 02:47:56.891]  January the 28th, in Houston.
[02:47:57.051 --> 02:48:02.213]  Helicopters and the sound of gunfire created a lot of concern this afternoon in one Houston neighborhood.
[02:48:02.513 --> 02:48:06.974]  And an army major who was out here wouldn't tell us exactly what kind of training they were doing.
[02:48:07.094 --> 02:48:10.675]  Miami, four days earlier, January the 24th, 2013.
[02:48:10.915 --> 02:48:15.657]  Still, if you've seen one of these drills, it really is like a scene out of one of those action movies.
[02:48:15.717 --> 02:48:18.477]  Choppers stalking this guy in downtown Miami.
[02:48:18.597 --> 02:48:20.478]  It's a joint military training exercise.
[02:48:20.778 --> 02:48:22.739]  Here's another one in Minneapolis, August 28, 2012.
[02:48:23.039 --> 02:48:29.321]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[02:48:29.461 --> 02:48:31.462]  They are training in an urban environment.
[02:48:31.942 --> 02:48:32.422]  Here's another one.
[02:48:32.742 --> 02:48:32.942]  St.
[02:48:32.962 --> 02:48:33.942]  Louis, July 3, 2012.
[02:48:34.282 --> 02:48:37.684]  It's a military mission in North St.
[02:48:37.744 --> 02:48:38.024]  Louis.
[02:48:38.404 --> 02:48:45.306]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town, and while they come in peace, there are all kinds of rumors about why they are here.
[02:48:45.586 --> 02:48:46.486]  Chicago, April 17, 2012.
[02:48:49.229 --> 02:48:54.170]  A pretty scary scene along the Chicago River turns out to be a military training exercise.
[02:48:54.270 --> 02:48:57.070]  Los Angeles in January the 26th, 2012.
[02:48:58.791 --> 02:49:04.772]  Special military operation forces in conjunction with the LAPD conducting some military maneuvers.
[02:49:05.092 --> 02:49:18.494]  Of course in the 2010 film Police State 4, the rise of FEMA, Rob Dew, Alex Jones and the other filmmakers covered the example of Arcadia, Iowa where the National Guard practiced cordon and search drills in neighborhoods
[02:49:19.074 --> 02:49:26.881]  Two specifically take on gun dealers to find quote weapons caches and Alex interviewed the officer who was in charge of the drill.
[02:49:27.161 --> 02:49:33.406]  They were admittedly doing it for domestic purposes inside the United States and we should really ask ourselves why.
[02:49:33.566 --> 02:49:38.330]  It says in this article going door-to-door asking if they can search homes looking for weapons.
[02:49:38.650 --> 02:49:46.677]  It's actually a planned training event to provide our soldiers with greater proficiency at what we call coordinate search.
[02:49:47.615 --> 02:50:03.644]  Which is a mission that, just for a little background, we've deployed nearly 13,000 members of the Iowa National Guard in the Global War on Terror and then actually searched for caches of weapons or other kinds of contraband which could harm American forces and other forces.
[02:50:03.744 --> 02:50:06.205]  Like Fallujah, what we saw in Fallujah.
[02:50:06.365 --> 02:50:06.705]  Correct.
[02:50:07.106 --> 02:50:08.466]  And then you have manuals like FM 3-39.40
[02:50:11.568 --> 02:50:23.232]  Specifically about internment and resettlement and they include the presence of PSYOP officers to win over the support of the American people and of course to deal with dissidents.
[02:50:23.252 --> 02:50:26.894]  And this happens throughout history every time an oppressive power takes over.
[02:50:27.294 --> 02:50:35.997]  The Nazis of course didn't only come in with a strong military force, they first sent in what equates to PSYOP officers, psychological operators,
[02:50:36.337 --> 02:50:38.799]  Who tried to win over public support.
[02:50:38.839 --> 02:50:40.259]  They offered children candy.
[02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:41.860]  They told them they were there to help.
[02:50:41.900 --> 02:50:43.401]  They did friendly public events.
[02:50:43.521 --> 02:50:46.423]  And we see this playing out again in American society.
[02:50:46.824 --> 02:50:58.471]  Unfortunately, where National Guard military troops who aren't supposed to operate domestically are operating outside of their role, but in benign ways at innocuous events to win over public support.
[02:50:58.831 --> 02:51:00.512]  And this too has been happening.
[02:51:01.846 --> 02:51:05.348]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[02:51:05.628 --> 02:51:08.710]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[02:51:08.890 --> 02:51:11.311]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[02:51:11.691 --> 02:51:13.632]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[02:53:01.164 --> 02:53:06.745]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older one gets.
[02:53:06.925 --> 02:53:16.107]  The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.
[02:53:16.507 --> 02:53:23.488]  If the Hunza men can play rugby in their 90s then it is possible for everyone in North America to experience a more youthful life as well.
[02:53:23.728 --> 02:53:26.529]  One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it
[02:53:26.969 --> 02:53:27.250]  I think so.
[02:53:44.128 --> 02:53:46.249]  This feat no one else has achieved.

[02:54:01.599 --> 02:54:03.801]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:54:04.361 --> 02:54:07.083]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:13.123 --> 02:54:23.249]  Alright, we're back on the Alex Jones Show and we are continuing with this Aaron Dyke special report video on how we are being acclimated for troops on the streets in America.
[02:54:23.309 --> 02:54:25.311]  Let's continue with that video report right now.
[02:54:29.333 --> 02:54:37.919]  Happy children, families, couples, a sunny day in early spring all over a park in Austin.
[02:54:39.045 --> 02:54:42.706]  This is the scene of the Austin Kite Festival, now in its 84th year.
[02:54:43.747 --> 02:54:46.888]  An iconic and idyllic scene of peace and recreation.
[02:54:47.168 --> 02:54:47.928]  What could be better?
[02:54:48.768 --> 02:54:57.812]  But outside of this festive atmosphere, which had clogged downtown traffic and brought normal activities on this happy weekend day to a halt, was a military presence.
[02:54:58.752 --> 02:55:03.374]  The Texas State Guard operating under the National Guard was running part of the event.
[02:55:03.534 --> 02:55:12.316]  They were invited there by the Austin Exchange Club and operated with the help of police, the shuttle buses bringing Kite Festival goers to and from the event.
[02:55:12.877 --> 02:55:22.440]  It was admittedly run as other training exercises are in preparation for natural disasters and other emergencies as coordinated by Homeland Security and FEMA.
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:25.841]  Including this article posted on the Texas State Guard website.
[02:55:26.321 --> 02:55:41.662]  TXSG flies high with Austin Kite Festival where they admit in part that festival organizers and participants gave the Texas State Guard soldiers real-world training for the kind of logistical support the organization provides during natural disasters and other emergencies.
[02:55:42.202 --> 02:55:50.871]  Quote, this gives us the opportunity to put our training and expertise into practical use in advance of our response to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or fires.
[02:55:51.311 --> 02:55:57.257]  The National Guard first appeared in 2012 at the Austin Kite Festival, provoking several news articles.
[02:55:57.577 --> 02:56:02.482]  The internet was ablaze with the account of the National Guard patrolling the Austin Kite Festival in 2012.
[02:56:04.003 --> 02:56:24.376]  But here in 2013, there was scant mention of the Nashville Guards' presence other than just straightforward PR releases of how they would operate the buses and how they would carry passengers to and fro, conditioning the public to accept ever greater control in violation of posse comitatus to keep track and control of the people under any pretext they considered necessary.
[02:56:24.756 --> 02:56:33.401]  Homeland Security and FEMA have made big preparations, not only for natural disasters, but also for civil unrest or declared national emergencies.
[02:56:33.601 --> 02:56:42.065]  And their training exercises have routinely included the very functions that these National Guard members were carrying out during this kite festival, where they would line up the
[02:56:42.125 --> 02:56:42.986]  We're good to go.
[02:56:59.804 --> 02:57:22.775]  Contingency plans for natural disasters and other emergencies have included in states like Texas and New Jersey RFID wristbands where members of the population would be tracked and tagged upon entering buses and throughout their stay at emergency centers like the one used by FEMA during Hurricane Katrina at the Superdome where the public was not protected but instead subjected to a laboratory of martial law conditions.
[02:57:23.035 --> 02:57:29.419]  While there is no sign of this kind of disaster at the Austin Kite Festival, I guess it's good that military and police were there to keep order.
[02:57:29.659 --> 02:57:36.763]  I actually captured a very dangerous individual on this camera, seen here at a young age in a stroller, using a terrorist weapon.
[02:57:37.483 --> 02:57:38.024]  The bubble gun.
[02:57:40.555 --> 02:57:47.820]  And there you go, that's the video report from Aaron Dykes and you can continue to watch the whole thing at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:50.761]  Troops deployed ahead of economic collapse and gun confiscation.
[02:57:51.122 --> 02:57:57.386]  An outstanding report there from Aaron Dykes and he was showing us the terror weapon bubble gun that shoots little bubbles.
[02:57:58.326 --> 02:58:00.347]  Held by a child, if you can believe that.
[02:58:00.587 --> 02:58:01.408]  Oh my goodness.
[02:58:01.708 --> 02:58:03.869]  And that's not even allowed on airplanes, as we talked about.
[02:58:04.389 --> 02:58:05.990]  In any case, the big stories today.
[02:58:06.030 --> 02:58:09.792]  North Korea vows to cancel the Korean War ceasefire.
[02:58:10.432 --> 02:58:12.933]  We've got mental hygiene in Maryland.
[02:58:12.953 --> 02:58:18.376]  We've got Eric Holder says yes, they have the right to attack Americans on US soil using drone strikes.
[02:58:19.096 --> 02:58:20.577]  And Hugo Chavez is dead.
[02:58:20.597 --> 02:58:25.579]  I want to thank the crew today for a great job pulling up videos and websites.
[02:58:25.860 --> 02:58:26.100]  CJ,
[02:58:27.629 --> 02:58:30.291]  Chris and John Bowne and the rest there.
[02:58:30.331 --> 02:58:32.532]  Thanks guys for doing such an awesome job.
[02:58:32.552 --> 02:58:33.533]  They're dancing back there.
[02:58:34.214 --> 02:58:35.174]  And thanks for tuning in today.
[02:58:35.214 --> 02:58:37.656]  This is Mike Adams signing off for the Alex Jones Show.
