[00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:09.994]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.994 --> 00:00:11.576]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:13.137]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:17.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.402]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:44.235]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 28th day of March, 2013.
[00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:52.279]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:56.241]  And what I want to do is shake the broadcast up, not that it's already not
[00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:01.299]  Really morphing into something more and more effective every day.
[00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:12.572]  I really do, and you know this, always want to try to sometimes take a lot of phone calls in the first hour instead of just ranting and covering the first few news stories in the first hour.
[00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.435]  I want to try to take a lot of phone calls from first-time callers.
[00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:30.667]  Concerning the state of the world, how crazy it's gotten, that so many people are waking up while so many others are basically going into their own mind control zone.
[00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:39.234]  And we've got to have an awakening that rises above the robot class, as Billy Corrigan has put it.
[00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.891]  And it really does come down to that.
[00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:46.192]  And all of us have to shake ourselves out of our trance.
[00:01:46.192 --> 00:01:47.273]  What am I talking about?
[00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.773]  Just out of our routine.
[00:01:48.773 --> 00:02:08.221]  I was on Billy Corrigan's friend's man-cow show today, and of course he's my friend as well, and he was talking about Billy Corrigan and the cover of the local newspaper saying, you know, Billy Corrigan, Billy Pulpit, rise above the robot class, something he said in an interview we did last week.
[00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:14.604]  He was going into the point that so many people are unconscious.
[00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:29.198]  And even before we were on break, coming back to his TV show, that's also a simulcast of his radio show, syndicated radio show, he was having to even tell his crew, all right, stop looking at your iPhone, stop texting, get out of your trance.
[00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:31.220]  Let's focus.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.845]  And everybody I talked to who's in management of media or anything else, you have to do this now.
[00:02:37.912 --> 00:02:42.193]  You have to keep your children away from the phones and the texting.
[00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:46.955]  People think they're living through this stuff, and what you're doing is you're dying.
[00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:53.437]  And that was a quote that Mancow said today that I am obviously not plagiarizing, stealing.
[00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:57.318]  I'm going to be using that term because you're not living in the matrix, you're dying.
[00:02:57.318 --> 00:03:05.821]  If you use an iPhone to videotape yourself exposing tyranny and put it on YouTube, if you use it to really talk about something important,
[00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:17.335]  Then it's a tool to fight corruption, but it still has Trojan horses to track, trace, and control you, and spy on you, and know your innermost secrets.
[00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:23.681]  Not just your shoe size, but what movies you like, and what your sexual preferences are, and what type of food you're going to eat, and where you're going.
[00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.945]  And then they can predict where you're going to go before you're going to go there.
[00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:28.586]  We're talking about the end of humanity.
[00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:38.505]  And not the rise of some new cybernetic life form that we merge with, but the rise of a nightmare.
[00:03:38.505 --> 00:03:42.008]  And of course, our story is linked up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:47.012]  It's down on the lower right-hand corner.
[00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:50.075]  Robo-reporters to replace mainstream journalists.
[00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:51.676]  I talked some about this yesterday.
[00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:56.760]  I want to get deeper into that today.
[00:03:58.499 --> 00:03:59.680]  There's also another story.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:08.006]  Jim Carrey backlash on eBay for his anti-gun video mysteriously disappears.
[00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:09.948]  Oh yeah, they won't, I guess, let you do that there.
[00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:13.711]  And then of course another article on the right hand side of DrudgeReport.com.
[00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:18.495]  Big Sis ignores congressman's demand for briefing on bullet buys.
[00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:22.618]  That's an example of the success that we're starting to have
[00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:25.529]  Through the alternative in real media.
[00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:26.689]  It's just really not even alternative.
[00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:27.750]  We are the real media.
[00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.150]  We are the true diverse media.
[00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.871]  We are the real liberal media.
[00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:36.454]  Liberal meaning liberty and freedom and private property, second amendment, due process, right to life.
[00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:38.875]  That's liberty.
[00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:41.516]  Right to life.
[00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:45.438]  Liberty and happiness.
[00:04:45.438 --> 00:04:49.660]  We are now able to force out and call out the man behind the curtain.
[00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:56.662]  And I told you months ago, and I told you a few weeks ago, we're now forcing this bullet story out into the open big time.
[00:04:56.662 --> 00:04:58.884]  Alright folks, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:04:58.884 --> 00:04:59.305]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:05.898]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.898 --> 00:05:09.819]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.220]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.922]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.922 --> 00:05:24.584]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.584 --> 00:05:30.567]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.567 --> 00:05:34.228]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.748 --> 00:05:39.032]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:44.977]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:48.540]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.521]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:51.642]  It's here.

[00:06:07.873 --> 00:06:10.678]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:06:10.678 --> 00:06:12.821]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:06:12.821 --> 00:06:15.145]  For years we've told you about our friends at E-Food
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.301]  I think so.

[00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:07.308]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:07:08.234 --> 00:07:14.977]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:25.921]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:30.063]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[00:07:30.063 --> 00:07:36.266]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:48.251]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.
[00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:57.015]  Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver based products are best for you.

[00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:05.919]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.240]  It is Thursday, the 28th day
[00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:33.894]  Have you thought about what freedom is?
[00:08:33.894 --> 00:08:35.374]  Have you thought about what your goals in life are?
[00:08:35.374 --> 00:08:36.375]  Are your goals just to satiate bestial
[00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:06.247]  Animal drives?
[00:09:06.247 --> 00:09:09.088]  Or are your goals something greater?
[00:09:09.088 --> 00:09:25.232]  Because though animal drives certainly satisfy you at a base plateau, to reach higher and to truly be fulfilled, you need to think about the big issues and be engaged in the world.
[00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:31.014]  And down that path leads enlightenment, wisdom,
[00:09:33.203 --> 00:09:35.104]  Sanity.
[00:09:35.104 --> 00:09:37.326]  Dignity.
[00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:41.569]  Prosperity.
[00:09:41.569 --> 00:09:43.670]  I want free will.
[00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.952]  And I want to control my own destiny.
[00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:47.773]  I want the truth.
[00:09:47.773 --> 00:09:52.236]  The whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.
[00:09:52.236 --> 00:09:54.698]  I want to be honorable.
[00:09:54.698 --> 00:09:56.939]  I want to be good.
[00:09:56.939 --> 00:09:57.760]  I want to be pure.
[00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:11.314]  My rudder is consciously and spiritually pointed at the North Star, the Pole Star of God's justice.
[00:10:11.314 --> 00:10:12.835]  My flesh is weak.
[00:10:12.835 --> 00:10:14.756]  The Spirit is willing, but my flesh is weak.
[00:10:14.756 --> 00:10:20.020]  But I want to be a good person, and I want to uplift humanity, and I want Veritas.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.641]  I want truth.
[00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:27.238]  And that's why the power structure, who knows who I am, and they know who you are.
[00:10:27.238 --> 00:10:32.888]  You've been in a technocracy, I've been in a technocracy, we've been born into it, most of us, for a long time.
[00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:36.572]  They know those of us that are true.
[00:10:36.572 --> 00:10:38.674]  They know those of us that have hearts.
[00:10:38.674 --> 00:10:41.556]  They know those of us that want justice.
[00:10:41.556 --> 00:10:52.064]  And so they use false systems of liberalism to guilt us into submitting to them and to following their templates of control.
[00:10:52.064 --> 00:10:53.425]  They want to program us.
[00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:54.926]  They want to run our lives.
[00:10:54.926 --> 00:10:57.188]  They want to use race and religion
[00:10:57.788 --> 00:11:06.690]  And it's socioeconomic and buzzwords to sit there and punch our buttons like we were a biological android.
[00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:17.233]  They seek to steal our free will because it empowers them to be able to shape our world.
[00:11:17.233 --> 00:11:19.614]  And to use us as their engines.
[00:11:21.388 --> 00:11:22.808]  Of control.
[00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:31.070]  To have us pay for and enforce and build our own mega-prison.
[00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:46.213]  And that's why, you know, I was reading a headline in the Chicago Sun-Times, and there was a bunch of other mainstream news articles, dinosaur media articles, with headlines like, Billy Corrigan's strange infatuation with a conspiracy theorist.
[00:11:47.469 --> 00:11:49.950]  They didn't say with a fellow human.
[00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.391]  They didn't say with the truth.
[00:11:53.391 --> 00:12:01.113]  They didn't say with a phenomenon in political thought.
[00:12:01.113 --> 00:12:13.436]  They said in every headline, there was three of them out there I saw, they said conspiracy theorist as a way to denigrate
[00:12:14.582 --> 00:12:25.529]  A fellow human's ideas and to also ridicule Billy Corrigan as if he came to speak to me because he has an infatuation.
[00:12:25.529 --> 00:12:30.452]  He came to speak to me.
[00:12:30.452 --> 00:12:40.419]  And I don't admire somebody like Billy Corrigan because he's a famous rock star that sold 35, 40 million records and made hundreds of millions of dollars, even though I like a lot of his music, love a lot of his music.
[00:12:42.336 --> 00:12:53.141]  I admire him because he's really down to earth, has a very small ego, is extremely smart, and didn't come here to talk to Alex Jones.
[00:12:53.141 --> 00:13:00.484]  He came here to talk to you to try to get you outside the box so that we can have a future together.
[00:13:00.484 --> 00:13:08.207]  And then they flippantly say his infatuation with a conspiracy theorist in an attempt to demonize Billy Corrigan
[00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:18.133]  For coming to see the bad man, Alex Jones.
[00:13:18.133 --> 00:13:29.079]  I mean, think about what that is when they say, you're a conspiracy theorist because you don't believe certified known liars caught lying hundreds of thousands of times.
[00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:37.604]  I mean, the lies are, they tell lies when the truth would suit them because they want to break you and condition you to accept nothing
[00:13:42.705 --> 00:14:01.256]  But a ether, a ocean, a atmosphere, a system, a wavelength of fraud, a war against reality, an overthrow of common sense and the human program.
[00:14:06.247 --> 00:14:22.753]  Anyone who looks at the New World Order system, though it claims it's doing everything for civil rights and freedom, can see that it is aimed and targeted at anything wholesome and anything regenerative, anything creative, anything Genesis-based.
[00:14:22.753 --> 00:14:29.295]  It is a death arrow, a sword, a weapon, a dart, a salvo.
[00:14:30.831 --> 00:14:42.954]  A artillery round fired by the forces of death against the engine of life.
[00:14:42.954 --> 00:14:58.197]  It is disease and ugliness and abomination of hundreds of animals spliced together in the human form in sentient clone beings
[00:14:59.628 --> 00:15:02.030]  Of abject ugliness and pain.
[00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.631]  And you'll never hear anyone call for their rights.
[00:15:04.631 --> 00:15:10.775]  You'll see little bunny rabbit symbols, which I agree with, on the back of shampoos saying, we didn't test on animals.
[00:15:10.775 --> 00:15:22.522]  What about Foxconn, suicide, and forced abortion, and Apple, forced abortion, or PepsiCo, and fetus cells, and the flavoring, on purpose to denigrate you.
[00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:28.286]  On purpose, as satanic alchemy, in their own words, to defile your soul.
[00:15:32.247 --> 00:15:34.388]  What about the real human rights?
[00:15:34.388 --> 00:15:41.652]  Well, they've got us worried about football issues, of gay marriage, and black and white, and all this infighting.
[00:15:41.652 --> 00:15:45.734]  They are worldwide.
[00:15:45.734 --> 00:15:52.618]  And they say, well, we're allowed to mix humans with chimpanzees, and humans with jellyfish, and humans with spiders, and don't worry, we kill them before they come to term.
[00:15:53.663 --> 00:15:57.285]  But we could keep them past term, which we know they've done.
[00:15:57.285 --> 00:15:59.907]  But that's somewhat shielded and classified.
[00:15:59.907 --> 00:16:04.470]  It's leaked out in some policy papers, which it shouldn't have.
[00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.872]  Just like antimatter weapons leaked out.
[00:16:06.872 --> 00:16:11.515]  It was in the San Francisco Chronicle and a few other papers a decade ago.
[00:16:11.515 --> 00:16:15.878]  Just like meteor guns, DU Shabo's leaked 20 years ago.
[00:16:15.878 --> 00:16:21.841]  The space fleet they've got, the drone fleet they've had up since the 70s.
[00:16:24.093 --> 00:16:30.358]  More than 15 generations of weapon systems up there now.
[00:16:30.358 --> 00:16:39.985]  Arrogant globalists in debates against Bob Bowman and others have been tricked on the stage into releasing classified information.
[00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:43.447]  That's how Bowman's able to talk about that.
[00:16:43.447 --> 00:16:48.571]  But the issue here is that you've got humans
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:17:00.625]  Human embryos spliced with all these other plants, animals, and insects, and then they say, well, they don't have any human rights because they're not human.
[00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:02.146]  You see that little lawyer trick?
[00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:06.749]  But then the bunny rabbit has, the bunny rabbit has a right.
[00:17:06.749 --> 00:17:07.670]  But it doesn't really.
[00:17:08.777 --> 00:17:18.344]  See, and the globalists, the transhumanists, the eugenicists said, we will teach them to care about the animals and then misplace their concern for humans onto animals.
[00:17:18.344 --> 00:17:24.608]  And by the way, I support those that are against abusing mammals and other highly intelligent sentient beings.
[00:17:24.608 --> 00:17:32.834]  If something's a prey animal designed to be eaten, bovine, deer, things like that, you don't kill them out of pleasure, but it's part of the process.
[00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:43.938]  But we're removed more and more from our humanity, where we just pull up and eat the hamburger at McDonald's.
[00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:48.382]  And that really is a form of corruption.
[00:17:48.382 --> 00:17:50.003]  And we all are involved in it.
[00:17:50.003 --> 00:17:56.870]  Because to not be involved in the humanity is to lose your humanity.
[00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.712]  Let me tell you something, you shoot an animal with a bow,
[00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:03.965]  You slit its throat to bleed it out so that the meat doesn't spoil.
[00:18:03.965 --> 00:18:05.807]  You butcher it yourself.
[00:18:05.807 --> 00:18:07.608]  You cook it yourself.
[00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:12.653]  You're thinking about that animal while you're eating it.
[00:18:12.653 --> 00:18:18.538]  And it's activating synapses and instincts in your mind of the entire human experience.
[00:18:18.538 --> 00:18:23.703]  You don't need to do that to connect to your race memories.
[00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:25.505]  You can do it by digging in the dirt.
[00:18:27.213 --> 00:18:46.341]  You can do it by planting seeds and then watering plants, and just doing that will open up, and I've never read this, I know this, I'm sure someone's written it, because any truth you've already found self-evident, others as well, activates and literally communicates with your soul.
[00:18:46.341 --> 00:18:54.105]  Going through the rituals of combat, going through the rituals of fighting, when you're a young man, that's why they want to make it illegal, put you in prison.
[00:18:56.109 --> 00:18:59.011]  That unlocks the synapses.
[00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:02.953]  That is the rites of passage.
[00:19:02.953 --> 00:19:10.897]  That's why the social engineers, I'm giving you the deepest truths here, want to destroy all the ancient covenants and all the ancient rituals of humanity.
[00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:20.302]  It is to break the genetic encoding recordings that are in the DNA from our ancestors.
[00:19:20.302 --> 00:19:24.905]  And the chills I feel when I talk about this is losing all of that information.
[00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.354]  You know what I cry sometimes?
[00:19:28.354 --> 00:19:36.599]  People say it's fake and it's not because I can feel the death of the connection to our ancestors and everything that's going to come in the future.
[00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:40.322]  It's the end of humanity and a horrible abomination.
[00:19:42.148 --> 00:19:45.091]  And I feel all of our ancestors crying out against us.
[00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:47.293]  That we awaken and have strength against this.
[00:19:47.293 --> 00:19:49.395]  That we rise above the robot class.
[00:19:49.395 --> 00:19:53.620]  That we break our chains and transcend the technocracy.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.903]  And take to the stars in our true destiny.
[00:19:56.903 --> 00:19:59.686]  We'll be right back as I break down the news and give out the number to take your calls.
[00:20:01.124 --> 00:20:04.505]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:10.527]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:20:10.527 --> 00:20:14.388]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:15.969]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:39.120]  Get SimpliSafe.com.

[00:21:36.547 --> 00:21:37.447]  We're good to go.
[00:22:01.587 --> 00:22:04.708]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[00:22:04.708 --> 00:22:06.068]  But what about the seventh?
[00:22:06.068 --> 00:22:10.289]  Unlike ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:11.810]  And it just won't quit.
[00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:18.451]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prepper, Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[00:22:18.451 --> 00:22:20.592]  That means safety and peace of mind.

[00:22:26.953 --> 00:22:29.234]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:22:29.434 --> 00:22:38.760]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.561]  This capitalism?
[00:22:39.561 --> 00:22:45.825]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:45.825 --> 00:22:46.686]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:46.686 --> 00:22:49.948]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:22:49.948 --> 00:22:50.748]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:22:59.774 --> 00:23:04.779]  Are you or someone you love struggling with stress, anxiety, or less than perfect health?
[00:23:04.779 --> 00:23:12.465]  Hi, this is Pastor Jenny, and as a woman of faith, I spent many years in ministry burdened with anxiety and fear.
[00:23:12.465 --> 00:23:13.666]  But in 2010, I met Dr. Carolyn Dean.
[00:23:15.848 --> 00:23:19.771]  And I took her recommendation to try RNA drops.
[00:23:19.771 --> 00:23:24.134]  Within days of taking RNA drops, my anxiety began to lift.
[00:23:24.134 --> 00:23:31.479]  My joy was restored and the peace of mind that I would have once called a miracle has now become normal to me.
[00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:34.381]  Discover what RNA drops can do for you.

[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.981]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:07.981 --> 00:24:16.867]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.867 --> 00:24:18.508]  Alright, Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:18.508 --> 00:24:25.192]  I just think about all the stuff they're doing in those cloning labs.
[00:24:25.192 --> 00:24:30.695]  Now, it's not just PepsiCo, but all the big companies are putting fetal tissue and stuff in different food products.
[00:24:31.852 --> 00:24:42.298]  They're not letting us even know if food's got GMO in it, and now they're moving to put aspartame in thousands of products and not tell you, including milk, ice cream.
[00:24:42.298 --> 00:24:46.420]  Diabetes is exploding, with cancer exploding, and it's just all supposedly funny.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:52.523]  You know, I get up here and warn people, and these newspaper reporters get up and make jokes about it.
[00:24:52.523 --> 00:24:53.924]  Aha, there's the conspiracy theorist.
[00:24:55.742 --> 00:25:02.186]  There was even a Washington Times article about now the people warning of the drones and the police state.
[00:25:02.186 --> 00:25:11.712]  We've been proven right as libertarian conservatives, but we've now got to back off a little bit if we want to maintain our credibility and not be like Alex Jones.
[00:25:11.712 --> 00:25:14.634]  I was reading that this morning and it's so obvious.
[00:25:14.634 --> 00:25:17.336]  It's like, don't listen to what this guy says.
[00:25:17.336 --> 00:25:21.899]  It's dangerous.
[00:25:21.899 --> 00:25:22.139]  Why?
[00:25:22.139 --> 00:25:23.100]  Because it's real?
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.081]  I mean, we forced all this out in the open.
[00:25:26.513 --> 00:25:31.816]  We forced the two billion plus bullets, the tens of thousands of armored vehicles.
[00:25:31.816 --> 00:25:35.258]  One purchase was $2,700 a few months ago.
[00:25:35.258 --> 00:25:37.299]  The things are all over the streets where I live.
[00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:44.664]  Every police department's being given new, you know, giant vehicles and Marine Corps surplus and Army and helicopters.
[00:25:44.664 --> 00:25:45.904]  I mean, that's no secret.
[00:25:45.904 --> 00:25:46.725]  They get up on the news.
[00:25:46.725 --> 00:25:51.588]  I saw another article saying, bullets debunked, armored vehicles debunked, drones debunked.
[00:25:52.168 --> 00:25:54.489]  It's just, I can't even track them all.
[00:25:54.489 --> 00:25:56.149]  Alex Jones is lying.
[00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:58.730]  Drudge Report's lying.
[00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.412]  Simultaneously, while they have other articles explaining why they have the billions of bullets.
[00:26:02.412 --> 00:26:05.853]  It's just, it's so obvious.
[00:26:05.853 --> 00:26:10.655]  Big Sis ignores congressman's demand for briefing on bullet by DrudgeReport.com.
[00:26:13.159 --> 00:26:14.480]  Uh, Watson, I just talked to him.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.180]  He's counting them up.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.341]  It's well over 15 now, like I told you earlier in the week.
[00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:21.482]  I would guess it'll be 30 by next week.
[00:26:21.482 --> 00:26:23.182]  It'll probably be 100 by the week after that.
[00:26:23.182 --> 00:26:30.864]  And then if we crest and can force the committee chairman to have a hearing about, well, why is Delta Force operating domestically?
[00:26:30.864 --> 00:26:32.245]  See, this is a whole can of worms.
[00:26:34.132 --> 00:26:35.253]  You can send these to Congress.
[00:26:35.253 --> 00:26:36.334]  Don't think they even know it all.
[00:26:36.334 --> 00:26:37.074]  They're too busy.
[00:26:37.074 --> 00:26:45.679]  Send them the local LA Times article about marines running DWI checkpoints 100 miles into California.
[00:26:52.950 --> 00:27:01.339]  The proto-articles about him running them five, six years ago in Southern California, in the local, you know, smaller papers, alternative media that first broke it.
[00:27:01.339 --> 00:27:08.787]  Send them all the info about in Tennessee, Army, regular Army checkpoints on highways that the governor criticized years ago.
[00:27:08.787 --> 00:27:12.612]  They just keep saying, no, there's no black helicopters, no, you didn't see a checkpoint.
[00:27:15.084 --> 00:27:21.886]  I mean, I've walked up to Tribbs at a checkpoint, it's in one of my Police State films, which was at Police State 2, and they're like, what are you, a conspiracy theorist?
[00:27:21.886 --> 00:27:24.547]  I'm like, hey, this is Violating Positive Commentatus, what are you doing?
[00:27:24.547 --> 00:27:26.548]  What are you, a conspiracy theorist?
[00:27:26.548 --> 00:27:30.949]  We've had our camera guys, you know, they come over with guns and the police take their cameras.
[00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:33.970]  Later gave them back to him and said, why are you a conspiracy theorist?
[00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:37.931]  As they did gun confiscation drills on record and told the local newspaper that.
[00:27:40.078 --> 00:27:42.340]  I mean, this is mind control.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.483]  And see, it's such a wall of fraud.
[00:27:45.483 --> 00:27:47.905]  People think that's because they're weak.
[00:27:47.905 --> 00:27:48.605]  And it is.
[00:27:48.605 --> 00:27:50.206]  They are weak, but they're also strong.
[00:27:50.206 --> 00:27:52.909]  It's strong if you accept it.
[00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:55.070]  It's a big wave.
[00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.632]  And they're denying the waves coming in.
[00:27:56.632 --> 00:27:58.934]  And we're going, oh, that's a big wave of lies.
[00:27:58.934 --> 00:28:02.837]  So if you just accept it, you've now bought into the lies, is what I'm trying to say.
[00:28:04.685 --> 00:28:09.807]  And I mean, I see them lying and it makes me pinch myself and go, am I wrong?
[00:28:09.807 --> 00:28:21.971]  And even though I know the information front and backwards and up one side and down the other, it still makes me question sometimes because it's just, this lying is so unnatural, so over the top.
[00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:27.393]  Because in a natural system, if somebody got caught lying over and over and over again, you throw them out of the village.
[00:28:30.652 --> 00:28:35.396]  So it's an attempt of the establishment to force-feed the lies.
[00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:40.381]  Here's the toll-free number to join us for First Time Callers to talk about anything I've been raising, any points, any topics.
[00:28:40.381 --> 00:28:40.441]  800-259-9231.
[00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:40.761]  800-259-9231.
[00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:42.202]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:28:42.202 --> 00:28:42.243]  800-259-9231.
[00:28:56.108 --> 00:28:58.110]  And be part of the worldwide transmission today.
[00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:02.813]  And I will get into all the stacks of news today.
[00:29:02.813 --> 00:29:08.898]  But first I want to take just a lot of your phone calls and all the wildcard issues that that will raise.
[00:29:08.898 --> 00:29:12.001]  There will be open phones throughout the transmission today.
[00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:16.945]  But we also have the report yesterday that I said I would get to.
[00:29:16.945 --> 00:29:19.146]  Will you guys reprint me that or I guess it is here in my stack.
[00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:23.883]  Yeah, robot reporters replace mainstream journalists.
[00:29:23.883 --> 00:29:25.424]  I will get to that today.
[00:29:25.424 --> 00:29:27.345]  And again, it's rolled off the front page of InfoWars.
[00:29:27.345 --> 00:29:29.547]  I'm going to have it added back to the front page.
[00:29:29.547 --> 00:29:32.229]  You can also find it at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:33.610]  It'll probably scroll off soon.
[00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.191]  It's on the lower right-hand corner.
[00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:37.792]  Robo reporters replace mainstream journalists.
[00:29:37.792 --> 00:29:39.574]  You see, all you that sell this system
[00:29:43.506 --> 00:29:47.109]  The energy and everything and sell your soul to it.
[00:29:47.109 --> 00:29:49.370]  You're empowering your own destruction.
[00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:49.971]  800.
[00:29:49.971 --> 00:29:51.352]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:53.894]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.894 --> 00:29:56.576]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:09.607]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:13.290]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.733]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:20.460]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.421]  Thomas Jefferson
[00:33:23.937 --> 00:33:26.539]  And Thomas Jefferson is alive with us now.
[00:33:26.539 --> 00:33:30.641]  His ideas, his information, transmitting down through time.
[00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:36.024]  His genetics transferring through hundreds of thousands of living people today.
[00:33:36.024 --> 00:33:44.449]  And just as you and I will go back to the dust from whence we came, our ideas and what we do is transmitted through eternity forever.
[00:33:45.356 --> 00:34:00.649]  Not just here in the visual light spectrum, but in the spiritual spectrum as well, that has now all been scientifically documented and proven to be even more real than the limited system with which our five senses are able to connect.
[00:34:01.587 --> 00:34:08.370]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, 28th day of March, 2013.
[00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.491]  Worldwide transmission.
[00:34:09.491 --> 00:34:13.933]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:34:13.933 --> 00:34:16.354]  And I will go to your calls in just a moment.
[00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:26.079]  Some of the giant magnitude information we'll cover when the next hour starts is Obama has betrayed America yet again by signing the Monsanto Protection Act into law.
[00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:33.817]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, he has signed the Monsanto Protection Act publicly written by them.
[00:34:33.817 --> 00:34:42.886]  That you not be able to have food labeled, that they be able to go after anybody they want, that they... Because, again, they're part of the military-industrial complex eugenics prime directive.
[00:34:42.886 --> 00:34:45.969]  So they're totally above the law, just as the vaccine makers are.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:52.184]  They can kill any amount of people they want, and they're quietly paid off, if you're lucky, by the government with taxpayer money.
[00:34:52.184 --> 00:34:56.767]  Also, cover-up of Adam Lanza to psychotropic drugs.
[00:34:56.767 --> 00:35:01.150]  Paul Joseph Watson, key article on that whole black-op.
[00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.852]  Biden, Senate gun bill, vote only the beginning.
[00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:07.554]  Of course, we're going to get your guns, Mr. and Mrs. America.
[00:35:07.554 --> 00:35:08.415]  We will ban them all.
[00:35:08.415 --> 00:35:09.435]  That's the official U.N.
[00:35:09.435 --> 00:35:10.156]  treaty.
[00:35:10.156 --> 00:35:11.437]  But then they tell you it doesn't exist.
[00:35:12.639 --> 00:35:17.461]  The official Catholic newspaper comes out and says, repeal the Second Amendment, take all the guns.
[00:35:17.461 --> 00:35:19.341]  The headline is, repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:35:19.341 --> 00:35:23.503]  But no one's coming after your guns, crazy man!
[00:35:23.503 --> 00:35:33.446]  Again, it's standard military procedure in World War I on up to announce this is not an assault, while you're being overrun by infantry and tanks.
[00:35:33.446 --> 00:35:36.307]  They told them at Waco, we are not assaulting, come out with your hands up.
[00:35:36.307 --> 00:35:38.428]  And you can see on the flare footage, they come out and they shoot them.
[00:35:39.261 --> 00:35:40.043]  from behind the tanks.
[00:35:40.043 --> 00:35:42.951]  They had infantry delta force behind the tanks.
[00:35:42.951 --> 00:35:47.303]  It is standard, standard, standard, standard procedure.
[00:35:48.968 --> 00:35:50.308]  And you're like, but it doesn't make sense.
[00:35:50.308 --> 00:35:54.189]  They're targeting the public that doesn't know how to even read a newspaper.
[00:35:54.189 --> 00:35:56.410]  That gets their news from movies.
[00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:01.771]  They go see Olympus Has Fallen and they believe North Korea can really attack the White House.
[00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:07.052]  North Korea has to create photoshopped stuff of landings on the beach.
[00:36:07.052 --> 00:36:10.432]  They can't produce automobiles there.
[00:36:10.432 --> 00:36:12.753]  They can't tie their shoelaces.
[00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:21.534]  Because they're a pure authoritarian system, and parasites have to have things to feed on, and they've already sucked their hoes dry.
[00:36:21.534 --> 00:36:29.638]  They are a shriveled, tiny, starving vampire, with 14-foot-long gray hair, that's crawling around on the ground eating bugs.
[00:36:29.638 --> 00:36:31.198]  Okay?
[00:36:31.198 --> 00:36:38.821]  The New World Order has taken the blood supply of liberty, and is a thousand-foot, foaming-at-the-mouth demonic goblin.
[00:36:38.821 --> 00:36:39.782]  Because we've empowered it.
[00:36:40.936 --> 00:36:43.840]  But if it was able to take over, it too would shrivel up.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.221]  Okay?
[00:36:45.221 --> 00:36:48.926]  The only reason North Korea is threatening to attack everybody is because it's like a vampire.
[00:36:48.926 --> 00:36:50.428]  It's like The Hunger.
[00:36:50.428 --> 00:36:51.369]  You ever seen that movie?
[00:36:51.369 --> 00:36:53.672]  Probably the best vampire movie out there.
[00:36:53.672 --> 00:36:57.477]  With, uh... I'm having one of those moments.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.023]  Well, I can't even sometimes know a common sense name.
[00:37:03.023 --> 00:37:04.784]  Little China Girl, all that stuff.
[00:37:04.784 --> 00:37:05.985]  What's the name?
[00:37:05.985 --> 00:37:06.826]  Bowie.
[00:37:06.826 --> 00:37:07.807]  Yeah, Bowie.
[00:37:07.807 --> 00:37:08.868]  Yeah, but I know the last name.
[00:37:08.868 --> 00:37:10.129]  What's the first name?
[00:37:10.129 --> 00:37:10.770]  David Bowie.
[00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.211]  Yeah.
[00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:15.114]  Folks, I got so much stuff going on in my mind today.
[00:37:15.114 --> 00:37:19.298]  I just I never go out to break and like start saying the phone number as we go out to break and it cuts off.
[00:37:20.177 --> 00:37:27.679]  It's just, it's just everything is so real and I'm realizing just how effective we are and it's not, it's the opposite of a power trip.
[00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:32.221]  So many people get a little bit of power and they go crazy in a megalomaniac power trip.
[00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:35.982]  I see that all the time and it freaks me out.
[00:37:35.982 --> 00:37:45.965]  With yours truly, it's the opposite and I am humbled and I ask God for guidance and God has given me great comfort even in adversity and
[00:37:49.396 --> 00:37:55.101]  At the same time, it's incredible to behold this.
[00:37:55.101 --> 00:37:57.402]  One cannot be told about the Matrix, one must see it.
[00:37:57.402 --> 00:38:17.718]  And I just wish that I could reach the people that are totally dumbed down, that get their news from sitcoms and dramas, that are just filled with anti-human, anti-decency, anti-life, anti-wholesomeness garbage, and that they think the bondage of the New World Order and all its degeneracy, they think that is liberty.
[00:38:26.636 --> 00:38:40.059]  One cannot see revelation without having spiritual eyes.
[00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:44.360]  Those of you deceived by this, I don't even hate you anymore.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.941]  And in a way, a warm friend has left me.
[00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:50.841]  Because hate is a warm thing.
[00:38:54.557 --> 00:39:02.302]  I always fought the globalists because I have love and that's my main engine, but there's always a nice strata of hatred.
[00:39:02.302 --> 00:39:03.502]  And now it's not even hatred.
[00:39:03.502 --> 00:39:08.105]  I am disgusted by these people.
[00:39:08.105 --> 00:39:12.328]  I now can see them clearer than ever and just see how pathetic they are and how weak.
[00:39:15.037 --> 00:39:33.981]  And being able to see into the future, not in some crystal ball way, but historically in the knowledge and the data and knowing the enemy by spending so much time really getting deep into it, it is such a giant fraud.
[00:39:33.981 --> 00:39:39.882]  Those that are weak and were hurt seek for power for power's sake
[00:39:42.603 --> 00:39:54.051]  and become delusional and lie to themselves and then are turned over to wickedness.
[00:39:54.051 --> 00:40:03.337]  And then you realize wickedness is a flailing, trothing, ugly thing.
[00:40:03.337 --> 00:40:06.519]  I know I'm preaching and I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:40:06.519 --> 00:40:08.501]  We're going to get into the whole Monsanto thing.
[00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:09.942]  I mean the abomination
[00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:14.792]  That they're getting federal laws now out there that no one can label anything.
[00:40:14.792 --> 00:40:17.795]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:40:17.795 --> 00:40:22.399]  And that they have total liability protection and they're God.
[00:40:22.399 --> 00:40:27.004]  When that company has a history of crimes against humanity that staggers the mind.
[00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:33.871]  And if humanity would just realize their peril, we could get out of this.
[00:40:33.871 --> 00:40:35.952]  But again, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:40:35.952 --> 00:40:37.173]  There is no danger.
[00:40:37.173 --> 00:40:38.933]  There is no bad man behind the curtain.
[00:40:38.933 --> 00:40:40.174]  There is no curtain.
[00:40:40.174 --> 00:40:41.635]  There is no establishment.
[00:40:41.635 --> 00:40:42.915]  There is no colluding.
[00:40:42.915 --> 00:40:44.696]  There is no manipulation.
[00:40:44.696 --> 00:40:45.256]  No, no, no.
[00:40:45.256 --> 00:40:46.977]  That only goes on in our daily lives.
[00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:52.300]  It's not going on up top, of course, where historically we know it's going on at the deepest levels.
[00:40:59.597 --> 00:41:10.846]  And then I look at all the news here where they are now coming back with second rounds of taking more people's money.
[00:41:10.846 --> 00:41:16.990]  They are banning cash all over the world in second-hand transactions from Louisiana to Russia.
[00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.992]  Russia to ban cash transactions over $10,000.
[00:41:18.992 --> 00:41:23.795]  Next will be over $5.
[00:41:23.795 --> 00:41:25.116]  They have stolen our money.
[00:41:25.116 --> 00:41:28.079]  Cyprus banks reopened with strict restrictions.
[00:41:30.649 --> 00:41:32.550]  300 euros a day.
[00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.352]  That's basically dollars.
[00:41:34.352 --> 00:41:35.812]  Withdrawn limit.
[00:41:35.812 --> 00:41:38.094]  Because they're coming back for more.
[00:41:38.094 --> 00:41:41.336]  No money allowed to leave country.
[00:41:41.336 --> 00:41:43.317]  Russia to ban cash transactions.
[00:41:43.317 --> 00:41:45.498]  Security tight as tensions run high.
[00:41:45.498 --> 00:41:48.540]  The securities to make sure the bank robbery can happen.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.262]  The reverse bank robbery where the teller aims the gun at you.
[00:41:52.262 --> 00:41:55.384]  Store exchanged.
[00:41:55.384 --> 00:41:57.185]  Stock exchange still closed in Cyprus.
[00:41:59.036 --> 00:42:01.197]  Ober, who we've had on, we need to get him back on.
[00:42:01.197 --> 00:42:03.957]  Not even gold will save you from what is coming.
[00:42:03.957 --> 00:42:09.898]  Bitcoins explode.
[00:42:09.898 --> 00:42:11.059]  Bitcoins explode.
[00:42:11.059 --> 00:42:12.979]  One of the inventors of Bitcoin wants to come on the show.
[00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:17.460]  We probably need to get him on.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.681]  And think about what's now just been normalized.
[00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:24.394]  Think about what's now just become commonplace.
[00:42:24.394 --> 00:42:28.636]  Oh yeah, they're now saying all over Europe they're going to start taking money out of people's accounts.
[00:42:28.636 --> 00:42:29.717]  Cyprus was a test run.
[00:42:29.717 --> 00:42:34.560]  Just like in the old days, they'd test chemical and biological weapons on an island.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.621]  You know, in case it got out of hand.
[00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:40.923]  They always test stuff like this on an island too.
[00:42:40.923 --> 00:42:50.229]  I laugh because I can look into the mindset of the establishment and that's really just a political reflection when I cackle like a witch.
[00:42:51.817 --> 00:42:54.318]  Because it really hurts.
[00:42:54.318 --> 00:42:59.601]  And we tend to laugh when things are uncomfortable.
[00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:02.862]  But I am kind of laughing at the people that are just still in denial.
[00:43:02.862 --> 00:43:04.343]  There's no problem.
[00:43:04.343 --> 00:43:05.363]  There's no armored vehicles.
[00:43:05.363 --> 00:43:07.924]  There's no tanks, even though they're using them right now in Cyprus.
[00:43:07.924 --> 00:43:13.567]  They're going after the accounts in Greece, Spain, and they'll end up in Germany, and they'll end up in America.
[00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:15.728]  They'll end up everywhere.
[00:43:15.728 --> 00:43:17.529]  And that's what the Casual Society is all about.
[00:43:18.547 --> 00:43:21.228]  And I told you this was coming forever, but I'm the fear monger.
[00:43:21.228 --> 00:43:24.790]  I'm trying to scare you.
[00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.271]  That's what they say.
[00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:29.652]  Really, I thought I was trying to warn you because I thought you were a man.
[00:43:29.652 --> 00:43:31.353]  I thought you were a woman.
[00:43:31.353 --> 00:43:33.814]  I thought you'd want to do something about this.
[00:43:33.814 --> 00:43:36.475]  I thought you were like me.
[00:43:36.475 --> 00:43:38.576]  I thought you didn't care what people thought about you.
[00:43:38.576 --> 00:43:39.817]  I thought you wanted the truth.
[00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:42.518]  I thought you didn't want people running over you, pushing you around.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.643]  But you think it's a virtue to cower, don't you?
[00:43:45.643 --> 00:43:47.605]  I'm talking to my enemies out there.
[00:43:47.605 --> 00:44:00.463]  All of you that are going to be replaced by computers within three years, most of what you see will be a master propagandist will write it, the White House, the corporations will release it, and then computers will rewrite it.
[00:44:01.388 --> 00:44:05.929]  A human, this was put out a decade ago by MIT, that's how I knew it was coming, now it's being announced.
[00:44:05.929 --> 00:44:06.829]  How great it is!
[00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:08.850]  The computers do a better job than humans!
[00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:09.930]  Wired Magazine, everybody.
[00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:12.571]  See, they're rolling it out like, hey, we got a new idea!
[00:44:12.571 --> 00:44:16.092]  Computers are going to write the articles, and they do a better job!
[00:44:16.092 --> 00:44:18.272]  They're given the faulty data.
[00:44:18.272 --> 00:44:19.893]  See, it's like, oh, it's like Zeitgeist.
[00:44:19.893 --> 00:44:24.614]  A big computer will run the world, and we live in these big plastic communes.
[00:44:24.614 --> 00:44:27.535]  Who programs the computer?
[00:44:27.535 --> 00:44:28.515]  Who gives it the data?
[00:44:29.699 --> 00:44:37.346]  Oh, the master programmer, the master architect, who would that be?
[00:44:37.346 --> 00:44:41.850]  And so, now the White House has told the reporters, we may just get rid of press conferences.
[00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:48.616]  You know what, if you don't toe the line perfectly, you're not going to be in our meetings, you're not going to be giving the press release, we're just going to release it ourselves.
[00:44:48.616 --> 00:44:52.559]  And then they're going to have with Nome de Plumes, pen names, computers.
[00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:56.302]  You could have one computer with a thousand Nome de Plumes.
[00:44:57.335 --> 00:44:59.857]  And then a human at first will spot check it.
[00:44:59.857 --> 00:45:04.541]  He'll say, this article was reviewed by... It'll have the little human's name down there.
[00:45:04.541 --> 00:45:07.743]  And see, out of the gate you're told, you're trash, you're dumb, you're over.
[00:45:07.743 --> 00:45:10.305]  Deep blue, big blue, he's the master.
[00:45:10.305 --> 00:45:11.986]  Nobody can do it.
[00:45:11.986 --> 00:45:12.527]  He can!
[00:45:14.756 --> 00:45:27.392]  And so the master computer engineers are already over the computers, they already have computers that track the computers, that control the computers, and they have robots that build the robots, that build the robots, that service the robots, with robot trucks that deliver the robots.
[00:45:27.392 --> 00:45:28.554]  It's already there.
[00:45:28.554 --> 00:45:33.179]  They're getting ready to hammer down and sit there in a giant simulation.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.261]  Watching what they do to you.
[00:45:35.261 --> 00:45:41.122]  They've got a simulation small city here in Austin, where they give everybody discounts to live in a slave grid and everything's tracked.
[00:45:41.122 --> 00:45:44.944]  And they're rolling out the... Those are the cancer metastasides.
[00:45:44.944 --> 00:45:47.765]  Imperial probe droids are being planted on your house.
[00:45:47.765 --> 00:45:49.445]  They're in all the new devices.
[00:45:49.445 --> 00:45:53.626]  They're called the smart meters.
[00:45:53.626 --> 00:45:54.427]  What is that?
[00:45:54.427 --> 00:45:55.687]  Sounds like it's Imperial.
[00:45:55.687 --> 00:45:56.467]  Boom!
[00:45:56.467 --> 00:45:57.828]  Right on the side of your house.
[00:45:59.782 --> 00:46:05.165]  All AI, the underground cities, the clone operations, the splicing, it's all on.
[00:46:05.165 --> 00:46:10.909]  And I'm up here right now just telling you, as the shadows lengthen, what's coming.
[00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:16.752]  The shut off of the infrastructure worldwide, the shut off of everything.
[00:46:16.752 --> 00:46:19.554]  People say, you're scary, you're trying to scare me.
[00:46:24.622 --> 00:46:25.963]  You don't want the stimulus, do you?
[00:46:25.963 --> 00:46:44.063]  See, an amoeba, if you put, if you have a single cell organism in a petri dish, in fact, we could pull this up, guys, pull up amoeba, amoeba, fleas, heat, you can find these microscope videos online.
[00:46:47.298 --> 00:46:53.140]  You can even look at neurons that when a toxin or something comes up, they're electrochemical, they'll pull back in live time.
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.161]  Let me pull back from that.
[00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:58.261]  Let me pull back from that, but you won't pull back.
[00:46:58.261 --> 00:47:00.722]  See, oh, the cell's afraid when it pulls back.
[00:47:00.722 --> 00:47:02.082]  It's bad.
[00:47:02.082 --> 00:47:03.183]  It's bad.
[00:47:03.183 --> 00:47:05.804]  It's fear-mongering.
[00:47:05.804 --> 00:47:09.205]  A deer jumps out in front of your car and you slam the brakes on, you're fearful.
[00:47:09.205 --> 00:47:10.345]  No, I thought you weren't going to hit the deer.
[00:47:11.616 --> 00:47:14.518]  If somebody's house is on fire, you're supposed to let it burn.
[00:47:14.518 --> 00:47:15.919]  And they say, Bob, I was out of town.
[00:47:15.919 --> 00:47:16.959]  Why didn't you call the fire department?
[00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:19.100]  Well, I would have been fear-mongering.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.102]  Well, that would have saved my house, Bob.
[00:47:22.102 --> 00:47:23.643]  Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:47:23.643 --> 00:47:28.306]  No, I... And see, people already, in public, don't save someone most of the time when they're choking.
[00:47:28.306 --> 00:47:30.147]  When someone's hit by a car, no one helps them.
[00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:32.008]  When someone's scabbed, no one helps them.
[00:47:32.008 --> 00:47:35.790]  They have to pass laws where you get arrested now if you don't... But the cops say they're above the law.
[00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:39.032]  They don't have to render aid now.
[00:47:39.032 --> 00:47:40.153]  But you gotta turn your guns into them.
[00:47:42.316 --> 00:47:45.097]  Oh, and you're a coward if you want to own a gun, Jim Carrey says.
[00:47:45.097 --> 00:47:47.638]  You want to protect your family.
[00:47:47.638 --> 00:47:54.701]  I guess a raccoon that has claws and teeth, if you try to attack it, it'll bite you, because it's a coward.
[00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:57.182]  Not because it's normal and strong and not a coward.
[00:47:57.182 --> 00:47:59.263]  No, no, it's to be brave is to be a coward.
[00:47:59.263 --> 00:48:03.584]  To rally people against evil is to fearmonger.
[00:48:03.584 --> 00:48:07.886]  To tell your neighbor their house is on fire is a crime.
[00:48:12.915 --> 00:48:20.882]  And I look at all the demonic fallen people who know this show's for real, who at a spiritual level don't need to get orders from the New World Order.
[00:48:20.882 --> 00:48:24.945]  They get their orders from the guy that gives the New World Order their orders.
[00:48:24.945 --> 00:48:29.909]  At a spiritual level, animated, the Walking Dead biological androids.
[00:48:29.909 --> 00:48:31.230]  They've had big surveys out.
[00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.571]  Why is Walking Dead so popular?
[00:48:32.571 --> 00:48:34.213]  Because people go, I feel like a zombie.
[00:48:34.213 --> 00:48:35.774]  I feel empty.
[00:48:35.774 --> 00:48:40.238]  And by seeing the truth that they're spiritually dead, they find a warning.
[00:48:42.375 --> 00:48:46.279]  But they also then can laugh at someone more dead than they.
[00:48:46.279 --> 00:48:56.250]  A single cell organism, an amoeba, will run away from a tiny wire put into the petri dish.
[00:49:02.551 --> 00:49:03.952]  But see, there's nowhere for us to run.
[00:49:03.952 --> 00:49:05.193]  We can't run to the new world.
[00:49:05.193 --> 00:49:07.474]  We can't run to another, you know, to the hills.
[00:49:07.474 --> 00:49:08.995]  We have to run into the enemy.
[00:49:08.995 --> 00:49:18.600]  We have to cause a total awakening at our greatest time of peril to this time of wickedness to reverse the tide.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.681]  And we can do that.
[00:49:19.681 --> 00:49:21.682]  It's within your grasp.
[00:49:21.682 --> 00:49:29.887]  I'm gonna go to break, and I said I'd go to calls, and I just can't do it because I have too much I want to say, but I'm gonna go to your calls in this segment, and then in the next hour, at the bottom of the next hour,
[00:49:32.091 --> 00:49:42.959]  I will go to a news portion on the police state, on the Al-Qaeda being run by the government, on North Korea, on Monsanto becoming god politically, just above the law.
[00:49:42.959 --> 00:49:45.021]  And Congress already said they're above the law on insider trading.
[00:49:45.021 --> 00:49:52.226]  Obama says he's above the law and that NATO commands our military and he's allowed to do fast and furious and Congress is going to exempt itself from the gun laws.
[00:49:53.446 --> 00:49:56.207]  Federal employees will be exempt in Feinstein's bill.
[00:49:56.207 --> 00:49:58.368]  I mean, wow, hypocrisy!
[00:49:58.368 --> 00:49:59.649]  All men aren't created equal.
[00:49:59.649 --> 00:50:00.769]  Total discrimination!
[00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:08.072]  But see, you can't recognize it, because the only discrimination is if you're white, then you're inherently racist.
[00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:11.873]  Everybody fighting with each other over race, which is so a thousand years ago.
[00:50:13.086 --> 00:50:19.813]  I mean, we're facing the extinction of humanity, the robot globalist, technocracy, merger with machine takeover.
[00:50:19.813 --> 00:50:23.717]  On record, humans being replaced with robots everywhere.
[00:50:23.717 --> 00:50:24.638]  It's already begun.
[00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:37.376]  And when they're done with you, they're going to shut off the infrastructure, the lights, the power, and when you're going to run into the compact cities, you're going to go along with the system, thinking you're going to be taken care of as your technocrat, you're going to die too.
[00:50:37.376 --> 00:50:39.037]  None of you are part of this.
[00:50:39.037 --> 00:50:40.718]  The globalists plan to kill 99.9999999.
[00:50:40.718 --> 00:50:41.338]  And then some.
[00:50:47.372 --> 00:50:50.513]  Publicly, they say 80%, so the 20 feels like they're part of it.
[00:50:50.513 --> 00:50:51.413]  Higher up, it's 90.
[00:50:51.413 --> 00:50:53.053]  You get into higher-level documents.
[00:50:53.053 --> 00:50:57.214]  They plan on killing all humans and merging with a machine and becoming God.
[00:50:57.214 --> 00:50:57.834]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.834 --> 00:51:01.374]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.374 --> 00:51:05.155]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.

[00:51:11.216 --> 00:51:13.336]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:16.177]  For years, we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[00:52:59.685 --> 00:53:05.207]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:53:05.207 --> 00:53:08.229]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:53:08.229 --> 00:53:16.552]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[00:53:17.199 --> 00:53:22.744]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[00:54:14.133 --> 00:54:18.877]  I want people to really think about the depths and the magnitude of what we face as a culture.
[00:54:18.877 --> 00:54:21.400]  Also, it's important to spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:30.268]  If you resonate with the information we're putting out, if you research it and find it to be very accurate, as it is, and a lot of times people say, hey, it's worse than you say, why didn't you tell us?
[00:54:30.268 --> 00:54:31.569]  Words can only say so much.
[00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.752]  And just please spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:54:35.752 --> 00:54:38.694]  Please spread the word about other media that's telling the truth.
[00:54:38.694 --> 00:54:41.036]  Please buy our books, our videos, our t-shirts.

[00:54:41.817 --> 00:54:43.658]  I try to find the best products out there.
[00:54:43.658 --> 00:54:48.742]  Whatever we promote, we believe in, and we use, and we've tried out.

[00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.671]  Please pray for us.
[00:55:00.151 --> 00:55:01.592]  And we'll pray for you as well.
[00:55:01.592 --> 00:55:03.414]  Zach in Texas.
[00:55:03.414 --> 00:55:04.635]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:06.977]  Welcome.
[00:55:06.977 --> 00:55:07.597]  Hello?
[00:55:07.597 --> 00:55:08.198]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:55:08.198 --> 00:55:10.380]  Welcome to the airways.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.020]  Howdy, Alex.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:19.728]  Basically, I wanted to talk to you about a situation with some anti-Second Amendment police in Arlington, Texas.
[00:55:19.728 --> 00:55:21.969]  Yeah, Dallas actually has a knock-and-talks.
[00:55:21.969 --> 00:55:24.171]  We're one of the first cities in the country and the surrounding.
[00:55:24.171 --> 00:55:28.095]  They come to your door in legal, lawful areas and ask to inspect your guns.
[00:55:28.095 --> 00:55:28.255]  Yes.
[00:55:29.566 --> 00:55:35.288]  Well, I didn't quite have that situation, but something similar.
[00:55:35.288 --> 00:55:40.931]  I live in a bad neighborhood in Arlington, and there's gunfire on a regular basis in my neighborhood.
[00:55:40.931 --> 00:55:56.457]  About three weeks ago, called 911, had officers come out, requested to talk to them, stopped by the house and said, well, I know you think you heard fireworks, I know you think you heard shots in your neighborhood, but they were just fireworks.
[00:55:56.457 --> 00:55:57.277]  No big deal.
[00:55:57.277 --> 00:55:58.338]  I told them, hey, you know,
[00:55:59.244 --> 00:56:00.324]  I own firearms.
[00:56:00.324 --> 00:56:01.845]  I will defend myself.
[00:56:01.845 --> 00:56:07.347]  If somebody in my neighborhood starts shooting in my front yard, I'm gonna defend myself.
[00:56:07.347 --> 00:56:14.810]  Well, fast forward a week and a half, and apparently there were some more gunshots in my neighborhood about 4.30, 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:17.051]  And they came and said you did it.
[00:56:17.051 --> 00:56:20.072]  Yeah, they came, pulled up in front of my house.
[00:56:20.072 --> 00:56:25.034]  I had just pulled into my driveway from coming from the gas station to get some gas to mow my lawn.
[00:56:25.034 --> 00:56:26.155]  I get pulled out of my truck.
[00:56:26.155 --> 00:56:27.655]  My mom gets pulled out of my truck.
[00:56:27.655 --> 00:56:28.716]  We get set on the curb.
[00:56:29.693 --> 00:56:30.734]  Search me, search my house.
[00:57:01.194 --> 00:57:09.498]  And cops showed up two minutes later, got in my face, came in the apartment without a warrant, pushed me up against the wall, and said, you don't ever hang up on us, boy.
[00:57:09.498 --> 00:57:10.759]  And I went, you're joking, right?
[00:57:10.759 --> 00:57:14.741]  And it was just like really weird.
[00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:15.742]  I never told the whole story.
[00:57:15.742 --> 00:57:16.622]  It's just so unbelievable.
[00:57:16.622 --> 00:57:19.184]  But it was like, you didn't steal your car, did you?
[00:57:19.184 --> 00:57:22.546]  Look, anybody in the third world country knows you don't call the police.
[00:57:22.546 --> 00:57:26.688]  You will always be accused of the crime because they don't want to be called.
[00:57:26.688 --> 00:57:28.129]  They want to go out and generate revenue.
[00:57:29.113 --> 00:57:33.536]  I mean, in Chicago, less than half the murders even get investigated now.
[00:57:33.536 --> 00:57:34.897]  And that's how the Mafia wants it.
[00:57:34.897 --> 00:57:38.920]  When you have a Mafia government... I mean, hell, the Dallas PD helped kill Kennedy.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.641]  They've been corrupt forever.
[00:57:40.641 --> 00:57:43.263]  People think the Mafia is only in Illinois and New York and stuff.
[00:57:43.263 --> 00:57:44.664]  Give me a break, folks.
[00:57:44.664 --> 00:57:47.046]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:47.046 --> 00:57:49.428]  Oh, well, yeah, yeah, just... So how did it end?
[00:57:49.428 --> 00:57:51.109]  How did it end?
[00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:54.932]  Basically, like I said, they got me on the curb, got my mom on the curb.
[00:57:56.979 --> 00:57:58.780]  I do have a concealed carry permit.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:57:59.420]  How evil.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.301]  Of course they knew that.
[00:58:00.301 --> 00:58:01.441]  They ran your license.
[00:58:01.441 --> 00:58:02.482]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:02.482 --> 00:58:03.263]  Thank God for me.
[00:58:03.263 --> 00:58:04.143]  I didn't have it on me.
[00:58:04.143 --> 00:58:05.144]  I had it in the glove box.
[00:58:05.144 --> 00:58:07.125]  So how did this end?
[00:58:07.125 --> 00:58:08.726]  They searched my truck.
[00:58:08.726 --> 00:58:15.150]  I tried to file a complaint and was told, well, procedure was followed and you can't make a complaint.
[00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:16.171]  It's not a complaint.
[00:58:16.171 --> 00:58:18.392]  I ought to get some of our legal eagles on here.
[00:58:18.392 --> 00:58:22.395]  You go file the criminal complaint and it's criminal if they don't let you file the complaint.
[00:58:22.395 --> 00:58:24.676]  Then you file it above them in court.
[00:58:24.676 --> 00:58:25.257]  You understand that?
[00:58:27.432 --> 00:58:28.413]  Well, you better watch out.
[00:58:28.413 --> 00:58:29.954]  You better watch out.
[00:58:29.954 --> 00:58:33.636]  Because in a lot of areas like that, let me tell you who delivers the drugs.
[00:58:33.636 --> 00:58:36.678]  And it looks like you're dealing with some really dangerous officers.
[00:58:36.678 --> 00:58:43.462]  You can either bow to them, move out, or get ready for war.
[00:58:43.462 --> 00:58:47.425]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.893 --> 00:59:01.018]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[01:00:30.834 --> 01:00:32.836]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now into hour number two.
[01:00:32.836 --> 01:00:34.257]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:34.257 --> 01:00:38.500]  I know XM joins us in the second two hours, and of course all the listeners out there.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.401]  A toll-free number to join us.
[01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:45.285]  We're going to have open phones throughout this hour and a ton of breaking important news today from around the world.
[01:00:45.285 --> 01:00:45.946]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:45.946 --> 01:00:53.331]  Monsanto has now had the Monsanto Protection Act written by them, signed by Obama.
[01:00:53.331 --> 01:00:54.092]  We're going to break that down.
[01:00:54.092 --> 01:00:57.975]  We're going to break down the latest geopolitical, and as the banks prepare to take even more
[01:00:58.035 --> 01:00:58.335]  We're good.
[01:01:15.635 --> 01:01:19.699]  And the bankruptcy by design of you and your family proceeds according to plan.
[01:01:19.699 --> 01:01:21.361]  But you don't struggle too much.
[01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:22.582]  Alrighty.
[01:01:22.582 --> 01:01:28.829]  I for one think we might want to raise the alarm bells and find our soul and our backbone again and reverse the criminal tide.
[01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:32.733]  And continue the long march towards humanity's ultimate destiny.
[01:01:32.733 --> 01:01:35.796]  Mikey in Chicago!
[01:01:35.796 --> 01:01:37.478]  You're on the air, Mikey!
[01:01:41.178 --> 01:01:46.200]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on down, Mikey!
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.280]  Gold Coast, Chicago!
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.042]  You know I'm not living in a place a lot of people down in Texas would want to be at right now.
[01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:56.223]  Well, I know we're on 1530 there, and a lot of great people in Chicago.
[01:01:56.223 --> 01:02:05.946]  I've been up there quite a few times, but it is sad that the criminal government is collapsing your society and will not prosecute murderers, and that the mafia likes it like that.
[01:02:05.946 --> 01:02:07.487]  They can kill anybody they want and get away with it now.
[01:02:08.334 --> 01:02:09.516]  I have 15 questions.
[01:02:09.516 --> 01:02:11.498]  I know I can't get to them all, but I have three.
[01:02:11.498 --> 01:02:13.340]  Whatever happened to Justin in the first film?
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.863]  Whatever happened to who?
[01:02:15.863 --> 01:02:20.869]  Justin, the young boy that you kind of interrogated there in the school.
[01:02:20.869 --> 01:02:23.032]  It wasn't a school, it was a college.
[01:02:23.032 --> 01:02:24.273]  You're talking about the UN, um...
[01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:30.633]  When you first started this, Alex, back early in your career, did your family or friends begin to disown you?
[01:02:48.917 --> 01:02:54.160]  No, my family knew a lot of history, so they didn't think it was as bad as I thought.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:03:02.105]  Some of my family knew more than I knew, because they'd worked in government, or they'd been in Vietnam, or seen things.
[01:03:02.105 --> 01:03:07.929]  I mean, I had some family that said, boy, you're lucky you're not getting killed, but you're dead on with what you're saying.
[01:03:07.929 --> 01:03:09.850]  Stuff like that.
[01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:15.653]  On GMO, sir, there's a woman, Robin O'Brien, who wrote a book about unhealthy truth.
[01:03:15.653 --> 01:03:16.474]  Are you familiar with her?
[01:03:18.324 --> 01:03:19.765]  Uh, it rings a little bit of a bell.
[01:03:19.765 --> 01:03:25.729]  We carry some of the best books on GMO at info or store.com.
[01:03:25.729 --> 01:03:27.511]  She has quite a testimonial in her book.
[01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:29.052]  It's called The Unhealthy Truth.
[01:03:29.052 --> 01:03:30.713]  I just thought I would recommend her.
[01:03:30.713 --> 01:03:31.214]  Sounds good.
[01:03:31.214 --> 01:03:33.115]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:03:33.115 --> 01:03:33.776]  No, go ahead.
[01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:35.037]  Sounds good.
[01:03:35.037 --> 01:03:42.943]  Oh, and then some people I want to recommend to be on your show, maybe you tried to get them on, I'm not sure, is like Ross Perot and Louis Farrakhan.
[01:03:42.943 --> 01:03:45.605]  I think a lot of demonization goes out to Louis Farrakhan.
[01:03:45.605 --> 01:03:47.066]  Hey guys, I'm going to say this right now.
[01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:49.411]  I want Ross Perot.
[01:03:49.411 --> 01:03:50.172]  I've said that before.
[01:03:50.172 --> 01:03:50.912]  Have we tried?
[01:03:50.912 --> 01:03:51.573]  I'm sure we have.
[01:03:51.573 --> 01:03:52.913]  I want Ross Perot.
[01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:54.434]  I want Louis Farrakhan.
[01:03:54.434 --> 01:03:59.198]  John Bowne talked to their people two weeks ago and he said he's interested when he gets back from the Caribbean.
[01:03:59.198 --> 01:04:00.719]  Stay on it.
[01:04:00.719 --> 01:04:03.841]  And yeah, just send us emails of who you recommend.
[01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:06.243]  Absolutely, I want to get them on the show.
[01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:09.125]  I want to contact these congressmen.
[01:04:09.125 --> 01:04:12.007]  Chris, go after the congressmen that are saying they're going to start an investigation.
[01:04:12.007 --> 01:04:15.289]  There's another article out on today over the guns.
[01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:16.790]  Over the bullets and guns and armored vehicles.
[01:04:18.792 --> 01:04:22.655]  Anything else, sir?
[01:04:22.655 --> 01:04:24.277]  No, I think people are losing the skill.
[01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:28.360]  If you watch Fox News or CNN, people talk back and forth.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.944]  But nowadays I notice people, if they do talk, they kind of talk for like five minutes and then you're supposed to talk.
[01:04:32.944 --> 01:04:34.325]  We're going back and forth, bro.
[01:04:34.325 --> 01:04:34.646]  Go ahead.
[01:04:36.918 --> 01:04:49.322]  Um, as far as guns, I always thought it was a good idea for all our society in America to keep our guns, because I don't hear people bringing it up a lot, but it just seems like if we're ever invaded, here we are, the farmers, the citizens.
[01:04:49.322 --> 01:04:50.903]  I mean, that's a deterrent.
[01:04:50.903 --> 01:04:51.623]  No, you're right, brother.
[01:04:51.623 --> 01:04:52.444]  It's a great point.
[01:04:52.444 --> 01:04:54.384]  God bless you.
[01:04:54.384 --> 01:04:57.305]  No, it's good that only the government have the guns, and that was like Nazi Germany.
[01:04:57.305 --> 01:04:58.246]  That's a good idea.
[01:04:58.246 --> 01:04:58.846]  You're actually wrong.
[01:05:01.161 --> 01:05:09.707]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:05:09.707 --> 01:05:13.390]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:17.833]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:22.556]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[01:06:00.655 --> 01:06:07.878]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:06:07.878 --> 01:06:25.767]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:06:25.767 --> 01:06:29.869]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:06:30.149 --> 01:06:31.910]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:40.076]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:07:10.478 --> 01:07:16.563]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:07:16.563 --> 01:07:27.352]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:07:27.552 --> 01:07:34.054]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:48.779]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[01:07:48.999 --> 01:07:51.344]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:08:18.323 --> 01:08:22.426]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:08:22.426 --> 01:08:26.149]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:34.275]  Words like violence break the silence.
[01:08:34.275 --> 01:08:38.658]  Well, my goal is to come crashing into your little world.
[01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:45.544]  Because the globalists, the technocrats, the social engineers, the mind warfare experts want you in a little world.
[01:08:46.684 --> 01:08:49.148]  They want you to not realize your destiny.
[01:08:49.148 --> 01:08:52.613]  They don't want you to realize how powerful and how beautiful and how good you are.
[01:08:53.479 --> 01:09:10.549]  The fact that you can paint, the fact that you can love, the fact that you can help others, the fact that you can recognize the beauty of the full moon last night with the clouds and the smell of spring, the fact that you can build is beautiful.
[01:09:10.549 --> 01:09:18.874]  Madison Avenue tells you you're ugly, tells you you're stunted, tells you you're bad, so they can sell you their fraud and sell you their lie.
[01:09:18.874 --> 01:09:19.595]  They want you
[01:09:20.655 --> 01:09:28.717]  Psychically and spiritually crippled so that they can sell you the prosthesis by which they enslave you.
[01:09:28.717 --> 01:09:32.598]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, this is Teleprompter Free Radio and TV.
[01:09:32.598 --> 01:09:37.800]  We're streaming video at InfoWarsNews.com and of course PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.121]  We're going to get into huge amounts of news, but I said I want to go through a lot of phone calls.
[01:09:41.641 --> 01:10:01.369]  We're going to go to those first, then get into Monsanto and the Monsanto Protection Act that Obama has signed, the huge military, police state, world news, more bank runs, more money to be taken out of people's accounts, panic in Cyprus, the globalist precedent to take our money, the new world order, eugenics, design, agenda 21.
[01:10:01.369 --> 01:10:02.749]  We're going to break it all down.
[01:10:02.749 --> 01:10:04.570]  We're now into hour number two.
[01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:05.950]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:06.871]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:10:10.652 --> 01:10:13.014]  Gene in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:10:13.014 --> 01:10:13.635]  Welcome.
[01:10:13.635 --> 01:10:14.636]  Hey, Alex.
[01:10:14.636 --> 01:10:15.337]  Hello, my friend.
[01:10:15.337 --> 01:10:15.897]  Can you hear me?
[01:10:15.897 --> 01:10:17.779]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:17.779 --> 01:10:21.142]  Alex, man, we got Kim trailed like crazy this morning in Oklahoma.
[01:10:21.142 --> 01:10:21.523]  Bad.
[01:10:22.659 --> 01:10:30.723]  Yeah, but for those that don't know, Obama and his science czar and Al Gore and all of them, but Al Gore says the program's crazy.
[01:10:30.723 --> 01:10:32.864]  Can you guys queue up Al Gore says chemtrails?
[01:10:32.864 --> 01:10:35.745]  I think the quote's crazy from like a month ago.
[01:10:35.745 --> 01:10:36.946]  We played it.
[01:10:36.946 --> 01:10:40.948]  They are and have been since the guy got a Nobel Prize in 1992.
[01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:44.630]  You can pull it up.
[01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:45.610]  We've got a whole file on it.
[01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:47.511]  We started making a film on it, but it was so big we never got to it.
[01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:49.393]  That's something that's going to come out in the future.
[01:10:49.393 --> 01:10:54.736]  One of the projects that's waiting there, just to have the infrastructure and crew and energy to do it.
[01:10:54.736 --> 01:11:00.280]  The whole Chemtrail geoengineering terraforming operation has been going on
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:27.203]  With electromagnetic antennas, with spraying, and it's all admitted at universities, in tens of thousands of documents, Department of Energy, aerosol, weather modification, all admitted, but we used the word chemtrail back when they denied it, and so still none of the public even knows it's real, and it's a conspiracy theory, just like the two billion bullets is a conspiracy theory, just like the armored vehicles are a conspiracy theory, just like world government's a conspiracy theory,
[01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:44.208]  As it's announced by the G20 three years ago that world government is now official under SDRs with a 100 trillion every decade global tax to be paid to them and Al Gore says there is no carbon tax but he officially called for it last week while saying it didn't exist in a psych warfare program.
[01:11:44.208 --> 01:11:53.851]  You pull up algore.com or whatever it is with his open call and they did find the video from Ellen DeGeneres as well where he admitted the program and he disagrees with it.
[01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:56.652]  Bill Gates, of course, is running the program.
[01:11:56.652 --> 01:11:59.373]  He gets paid taxpayer money to chemtrail you.
[01:11:59.373 --> 01:11:59.894]  Don't believe that?
[01:11:59.894 --> 01:12:00.354]  Just look it up.
[01:12:00.354 --> 01:12:00.874]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:00.874 --> 01:12:01.794]  Sir, you mentioned chemtrails.
[01:12:01.794 --> 01:12:05.196]  I'm going to give people a data-factoid salvo.
[01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:06.497]  Go ahead.
[01:12:06.497 --> 01:12:08.077]  Well, now there's four lines over me.
[01:12:08.077 --> 01:12:14.220]  There's just new four lines now, and they're spreading out to make this cloud sheen that's covering the whole state now.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.661]  Yeah, no, no.
[01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:16.862]  I got home last night at about 10.30.
[01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:21.281]  Pick Dave Mustaine and his wife and family up at the airport.
[01:12:21.281 --> 01:12:22.201]  They're staying out at the house.
[01:12:49.119 --> 01:12:50.801]  Walked out last night.
[01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:54.323]  I got home at like 10 o'clock and I was walking back outside with the dogs.
[01:12:54.323 --> 01:12:57.066]  And I looked up and it was solid chemtrails.
[01:12:57.066 --> 01:12:59.087]  Solid aerosol, didn't dissipate.
[01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:00.388]  An hour later it was there.
[01:13:00.388 --> 01:13:03.891]  You could see it misting and forming all the clouds with the moon.
[01:13:03.891 --> 01:13:05.112]  So it was pretty spectacular.
[01:13:05.112 --> 01:13:06.053]  But hey, it's alright.
[01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:07.494]  It's an admitted program.
[01:13:07.494 --> 01:13:10.657]  It's killing the soil and killing microbes that are healthy.
[01:13:10.657 --> 01:13:11.678]  And that's okay.
[01:13:11.678 --> 01:13:12.538]  Because it doesn't exist.
[01:13:12.538 --> 01:13:13.179]  Everything's fine.
[01:13:13.179 --> 01:13:14.340]  Eat some GMO.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:15.260]  Get brain cancer.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.862]  And give the Earth over to the globalists.
[01:13:19.005 --> 01:13:20.306]  Well, Alex, I appreciate you.
[01:13:20.306 --> 01:13:22.007]  You're a true patriot, man.
[01:13:22.007 --> 01:13:23.247]  I'm just trying to survive, brother.
[01:13:23.247 --> 01:13:24.548]  You know, I always say, don't thank me.
[01:13:24.548 --> 01:13:27.490]  I just want a future.
[01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:29.191]  And again, thank you.
[01:13:29.191 --> 01:13:31.492]  God bless you for listening and being involved, sir.
[01:13:31.492 --> 01:13:32.533]  It's so humbling.
[01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:33.313]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:36.581 --> 01:13:42.707]  You know, driving back in from the airport after where I live out in the countryside, pulled into this little barbecue place right as it was closing, but they let us come in.
[01:13:42.707 --> 01:13:44.489]  That was one family in there.
[01:13:44.489 --> 01:13:46.151]  They were all listeners.
[01:13:46.151 --> 01:13:49.674]  And in fact, the fellow said he sent us an article a while back we didn't post.
[01:13:49.674 --> 01:13:50.995]  And I'd met the guy before.
[01:13:50.995 --> 01:13:54.559]  He put some phone lines in out of my house.
[01:13:54.559 --> 01:13:57.162]  And so I forgot to tell Robbie to look for his article.
[01:13:58.428 --> 01:14:02.730]  It was on the philosopher Hegel, the theory of movement, I think is the headline.
[01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:04.590]  He said he'd send it again last night.
[01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:06.131]  And if it's a good article, the guy seems smart.
[01:14:06.131 --> 01:14:07.451]  I talked to him about 10 minutes.
[01:14:07.451 --> 01:14:12.193]  Anyways, I'm going in there to talk to them and he had that info.
[01:14:12.193 --> 01:14:16.215]  It's just so humbling to run into people that are so awake out there.
[01:14:16.215 --> 01:14:19.436]  Why did I start telling the barbecue story?
[01:14:19.436 --> 01:14:21.037]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[01:14:21.037 --> 01:14:26.439]  Let's talk to Raymond in Miami, Florida.
[01:14:26.439 --> 01:14:26.959]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:14:26.959 --> 01:14:27.379]  You're on the air.
[01:14:28.926 --> 01:14:31.947]  I ain't doing Alex first time, call a long time listener.
[01:14:31.947 --> 01:14:36.008]  Welcome.
[01:14:36.008 --> 01:14:38.689]  You know, how do they refer to it as?
[01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:42.129]  FEMA Region 4?
[01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:46.030]  Yes, you're calling in from FEMA Region 4, formerly of the United States.
[01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:55.573]  Yes, foreign banker, OECD, UN, Organization of Economic Cooperative Development, XM, securitized, conquered region.
[01:14:57.389 --> 01:15:14.248]  Yes sir, absolutely, but I'm calling on behalf of all patriots, all true soldiers, and representatives of this free nation, this republic that was founded by great people who believed in freedom, free markets, and the opportunity for everyone to have a good future.
[01:15:14.248 --> 01:15:17.312]  I'm calling on behalf of all those who are aware and await
[01:15:17.975 --> 01:15:20.737]  It was going on by these global so-called elite.
[01:15:20.737 --> 01:15:24.420]  I don't even refer to them as elite because that gives them a pedestal that they haven't deserved.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:28.343]  No, I mean, I refer to them as pig demons.
[01:15:28.343 --> 01:15:29.644]  Yeah, I refer to them as scum.
[01:15:29.644 --> 01:15:39.012]  You know, the words that I refer to them as, I really can't say because I know you have, you know... What they are, sir, is what Bob Marley called them.
[01:15:39.012 --> 01:15:44.776]  They are the Babylon... They are the vampires of Babylon.
[01:15:44.776 --> 01:15:45.297]  Absolutely.
[01:15:45.297 --> 01:15:46.158]  I definitely agree.
[01:15:47.782 --> 01:15:50.404]  They are psychic vampires and physical vampires.
[01:15:50.404 --> 01:15:54.607]  They don't grow fanged teeth, and they don't burn up in the sunshine.
[01:15:54.607 --> 01:15:57.109]  I mean, these people are vampires, though.
[01:15:57.109 --> 01:16:01.893]  All the legends, the legends are just a manifestation of what they really are.
[01:16:03.587 --> 01:16:04.107]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:04.107 --> 01:16:05.509]  They are energy vampires.
[01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:11.954]  They are... Look, the legends in every culture are the rich guys live in a castle and grab our kids at night and eat them.
[01:16:11.954 --> 01:16:24.183]  And then Bram Stoker called it, you know, Dracula and put it into that composite of... But people just said they're basically, don't get near the castle, don't live near the castle, and hide at night because they come to eat you.
[01:16:24.183 --> 01:16:25.344]  And that's psychopaths.
[01:16:25.344 --> 01:16:27.145]  The elite like to kill people.
[01:16:27.145 --> 01:16:28.286]  They like to kill kids.
[01:16:28.286 --> 01:16:28.787]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:16:30.154 --> 01:16:36.978]  Well, I'd like everybody to know that I'm the father of a nine-month-old, unvaccinated, very beautiful, very healthy baby girl.
[01:16:36.978 --> 01:16:45.564]  And if anyone really wants to know what's going on in the world and really wants to be aware, this man you are listening to is on the front tier.
[01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:46.624]  He's on the front lines.
[01:16:46.624 --> 01:16:52.288]  Whether you agree with everything he does or says or not is irrelevant, because you'll never agree with everyone on everything.
[01:16:52.288 --> 01:16:54.029]  But if you do the research and actually
[01:16:54.815 --> 01:17:01.039]  Go find out if these dots are connected that this man has been telling us for over 15 years.
[01:17:01.039 --> 01:17:05.402]  Then you will see that everything is correct and all we need to do is to enforce it.
[01:17:05.402 --> 01:17:09.024]  Everyone who believes in humanity and love and respect
[01:17:09.794 --> 01:17:17.080]  Absolutely, and we've all got to pray to God to make us stronger during this time because this is going to be a great challenge.
[01:17:26.956 --> 01:17:31.921]  Yes sir, and the main last thing I wanted to say is everyone please be aware of another false flag attack.
[01:17:31.921 --> 01:17:33.302]  They are demonizing patriots.
[01:17:33.302 --> 01:17:36.345]  They're demonizing anyone who believes in freedom.
[01:17:36.345 --> 01:17:38.887]  Whether it's gun rights, freedom of speech, or anything else.
[01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:39.888]  Please be aware.
[01:17:39.888 --> 01:17:41.890]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.211]  God bless you sir.
[01:17:43.211 --> 01:17:47.395]  And by the way, I just realized, I used to look at this camera mainly, but I like sitting here looking at this camera.
[01:17:47.395 --> 01:17:48.696]  The clock is over there.
[01:17:49.457 --> 01:17:50.197]  Can we move it?
[01:17:50.197 --> 01:17:52.198]  Because I can't really see this one down in the dark.
[01:17:52.198 --> 01:17:53.918]  Can we move that clock over there?
[01:17:53.918 --> 01:17:58.200]  Because I've seen on YouTube, why is Alex always looking over to his right?
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.660]  Is somebody telling him something?
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:01.821]  No, I'm looking at the clock.
[01:18:01.821 --> 01:18:10.184]  Maybe you guys can aim the document cam over there so they can see I'm looking at the clock and it's always distracting me having to look over at the clock and then it becomes a whole new conspiracy theory that the
[01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:14.479]  That the Illuminati's over there giving me orders.
[01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:16.260]  Man, sometimes I wish I was being given orders.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:20.703]  I tell you what, being in charge of things is a mighty, mighty responsibility.
[01:18:20.703 --> 01:18:22.203]  It was great hearing from that gentleman.
[01:18:22.203 --> 01:18:26.886]  You could just feel the love in his heart and the sense of justice and just the hope of goodness.
[01:18:26.886 --> 01:18:32.510]  But then the world's so evil, you end up wanting to use the corrupt tactics to beat it, but then you just become it.
[01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:37.993]  And, you know, I think our main mission is just to get people to realize how serious this New World Order is.
[01:18:40.837 --> 01:18:43.057]  And understand that none of us are coming out of this.
[01:18:43.057 --> 01:18:46.118]  I mean, this thing has come to kill everybody.
[01:18:46.118 --> 01:18:56.280]  And a lot of you, you know, want to get into death and wear a bunch of skulls and feel all powerful and because really you're afraid of it.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.760]  It's kind of like a Stockholm Syndrome to the devil.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.220]  The ultimate Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.421]  Satanic Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:19:02.421 --> 01:19:09.982]  So many people I've discovered who are into darkness and manipulating people from a dark perspective are actually very, very weak, scared people.
[01:19:11.894 --> 01:19:22.857]  And they're so scared of darkness and death, and they're so weak, that they, like moths to the black flame of Satan, think they're going to get power out of it.
[01:19:22.857 --> 01:19:26.118]  And they are just incredibly weak.
[01:19:26.118 --> 01:19:28.739]  And in the past I had an instinct to want to, you know, chop them up.
[01:19:30.114 --> 01:19:31.555]  You know, basically.
[01:19:31.555 --> 01:19:33.516]  But that's not my instinct now.
[01:19:33.516 --> 01:19:36.218]  I believe even most of them can be reached.
[01:19:36.218 --> 01:19:44.745]  It's not very many, but the very high priests of the New World Order who are really totally committed to this.
[01:19:44.745 --> 01:19:50.749]  And they themselves are not really Satanists, they're Luciferians and believe they're going to become God after they merge with the machines.
[01:19:50.749 --> 01:19:55.072]  And there's another camp that believes they're going to merge with the genetic template.
[01:19:55.072 --> 01:19:58.955]  There's two branches of the New World Order trying to achieve technocratic godhood.

[01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:46.155]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:46.155 --> 01:22:46.956]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:46.956 --> 01:22:50.098]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:51.038]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:23:04.227 --> 01:23:06.649]  Curious about what comes next?
[01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:13.355]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars.
[01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:16.717]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[01:23:16.717 --> 01:23:23.202]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[01:23:23.202 --> 01:23:26.545]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[01:23:27.265 --> 01:23:32.608]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[01:23:32.608 --> 01:23:39.051]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[01:23:39.051 --> 01:23:43.873]  The new Brighter Fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.

[01:23:56.119 --> 01:24:02.221]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:24:02.221 --> 01:24:05.682]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth.
[01:24:05.682 --> 01:24:09.703]  He can do it as he please.
[01:24:09.703 --> 01:24:17.405]  And if things don't change soon, he will.
[01:24:17.405 --> 01:24:21.326]  For a man has invented his doom.
[01:24:21.326 --> 01:24:23.146]  First step was touching,
[01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:24.967]  That's the question.
[01:24:24.967 --> 01:24:27.649]  Can we not destroy ourselves?
[01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:30.671]  Yeah, the government says they're by the law.
[01:24:30.671 --> 01:24:31.471]  They tell us that
[01:24:51.667 --> 01:24:55.830]  They're above the law, but we shouldn't be able to have guns or private property or raise our children.
[01:24:55.830 --> 01:25:02.895]  It's just all ridiculous how much we put up with by increments.
[01:25:02.895 --> 01:25:05.396]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Illinois.
[01:25:05.396 --> 01:25:08.799]  Big news breakdown coming up after I go to this next battery of calls.
[01:25:08.799 --> 01:25:11.801]  Bill, you're on the air, you're watching via PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:25:11.801 --> 01:25:12.962]  Go ahead.
[01:25:12.962 --> 01:25:14.002]  Uh, hey.
[01:25:14.002 --> 01:25:15.383]  First time caller.
[01:25:15.383 --> 01:25:18.566]  I have some, uh, weird stuff going on in my life.
[01:25:18.566 --> 01:25:19.086]  I ended up
[01:25:19.776 --> 01:25:43.156]  I don't know if you talk about electronic harassment or gang stalking or that kind of thing when maybe you pissed off someone politically, but I was being a little outspoken about Patriot Act and NDAA and some stuff I didn't agree with.
[01:25:43.156 --> 01:25:44.377]  I ended up getting drugged.
[01:25:47.731 --> 01:26:05.678]  Weird stuff happened in my area, and some stuff was stolen from my house, possibly to blackmail me with, and I have every reason to believe that the government's behind it, but... Well, look, let me explain what's going on here.
[01:26:07.697 --> 01:26:10.260]  There are a lot of drugs in the food and the water and the culture.
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:12.123]  The culture is in crisis.
[01:26:12.123 --> 01:26:14.206]  There's general mind control going on.
[01:26:14.206 --> 01:26:15.407]  There's general evil.
[01:26:15.407 --> 01:26:17.590]  Society is degenerating.
[01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:22.337]  That's why the whole world is full of ruins of civilizations that existed and fell apart.
[01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:27.916]  Because people become lazy, they become delusional, they become paranoid.
[01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:30.620]  And it doesn't mean that there isn't real forces going on.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:35.326]  Your iPhone's spying on you, your computer's spying on you, but no one's ever worried about that.
[01:26:35.326 --> 01:26:37.849]  They're always worried, you know, that people are looking at them.
[01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:42.971]  And then a lot of it is if you're looking paranoid in front of the cops, they're all going to mess with you.
[01:26:42.971 --> 01:26:47.252]  If you're looking paranoid in front of people in businesses, they're going to come up and mess with you.
[01:26:47.252 --> 01:26:50.373]  And then you're going to think everyone is after you.
[01:26:50.373 --> 01:26:58.234]  But if you are in a super good mood and super happy and telling jokes and stuff and you're not married, you're going to have women coming up to you.
[01:26:58.234 --> 01:27:00.795]  So, so much of it is how you act and what you expect.
[01:27:00.795 --> 01:27:04.316]  Now, there are cases where, let's say, you catch police stealing drugs in your area.
[01:27:05.316 --> 01:27:06.537]  They'll start pulling you over all the time.
[01:27:06.537 --> 01:27:08.478]  They'll plant drugs on you and put you in jail.
[01:27:08.478 --> 01:27:09.599]  I've seen that happen with people.
[01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:11.680]  I grew up in Dallas and watched that go on.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.943]  So there are times, you know, if you're pretty prominent, you can get messed with.
[01:27:14.943 --> 01:27:21.387]  They messed with Hemingway because he was starting to lean towards communists.
[01:27:21.387 --> 01:27:22.228]  He wasn't a bad guy.
[01:27:22.228 --> 01:27:24.089]  He was misguided, but also very smart.
[01:27:24.089 --> 01:27:31.754]  So they did mess with him and then got people to say he was crazy and then committed him and electroshocked him, basically, until they did fry his brain.
[01:27:31.754 --> 01:27:34.156]  And later it came out it was a COINTELPRO PSYOP.
[01:27:35.188 --> 01:27:37.230]  But I don't think you're Ernest Hemingway.
[01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:38.751]  No, I'm not Ernest Hemingway.
[01:27:38.751 --> 01:27:41.273]  See, I've had them with me call up and say, we're going to kill you and your family.
[01:27:41.273 --> 01:27:42.594]  And you were just talking about this.
[01:27:42.594 --> 01:27:44.115]  And I go, well, that's in God's hand.
[01:27:44.115 --> 01:27:46.858]  And that's a PSYOP back on them, because I'm committed.
[01:27:46.858 --> 01:27:49.019]  I'm like a kamikaze in the Infowar.
[01:27:49.019 --> 01:27:49.420]  OK?
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.361]  All that does is give me more energy.
[01:27:51.361 --> 01:27:51.621]  OK?
[01:27:51.621 --> 01:27:53.023]  So they've tried PSYOPs with me.
[01:27:53.023 --> 01:27:54.504]  I'm not Ernest Hemingway.
[01:27:54.504 --> 01:27:55.324]  OK?
[01:27:55.324 --> 01:28:01.830]  And so what I'm telling you is, sir, because the atmosphere is so crazy, there are a lot of people that were already borderline schizophrenic.
[01:28:02.762 --> 01:28:06.664]  That then get messed with or have a problem in their life or they're just crime.
[01:28:06.664 --> 01:28:08.184]  Society's breaking down.
[01:28:08.184 --> 01:28:10.866]  And then you then think they're coming after you.
[01:28:10.866 --> 01:28:13.127]  They don't have the forces to do that.
[01:28:13.127 --> 01:28:18.829]  They try to announce they're spying on everybody to scare you in a panopticon psychology system.
[01:28:18.829 --> 01:28:19.730]  Look up panopticon.
[01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.950]  Off and on.
[01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:44.012]  But just listen, believe in God, believe in justice, okay?
[01:28:44.012 --> 01:28:48.054]  And ask God to give you protection, because believe me, it's real.
[01:28:48.054 --> 01:28:52.156]  Ask God, ask God, ask God to show you your guardian angel.
[01:28:52.156 --> 01:28:53.977]  You have nothing to worry about, buddy.
[01:28:53.977 --> 01:28:59.419]  Even if they kill you, you are with... Well, they've threatened to.
[01:28:59.419 --> 01:29:02.601]  Okay, oh, really, somebody's called up and said, I'm gonna kill you.
[01:29:02.601 --> 01:29:03.161]  I can't hear you.
[01:29:03.161 --> 01:29:04.381]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:05.722]  Talk into your telephone.
[01:29:05.722 --> 01:29:07.263]  Sorry, sorry.
[01:29:07.263 --> 01:29:09.384]  Someone walked up to me
[01:29:09.952 --> 01:29:18.375]  Well, there are a lot of crazy people all over the place, sir.
[01:29:18.375 --> 01:29:19.555]  Society's breaking down.
[01:29:19.555 --> 01:29:24.057]  I mean, if you're walking around in somebody's yard, they're going to come out and ask what you're doing.
[01:29:24.057 --> 01:29:25.897]  Listen, stop acting paranoid.
[01:29:25.897 --> 01:29:28.358]  See, people always accuse me of being paranoid.
[01:29:28.358 --> 01:29:28.998]  I'm the opposite.
[01:29:28.998 --> 01:29:30.279]  I know what's going on.
[01:29:30.279 --> 01:29:31.999]  I'm in their face.
[01:29:31.999 --> 01:29:33.820]  I'm walking around, no bodyguards, no nothing.
[01:29:34.733 --> 01:29:35.553]  I'm the opposite of that.
[01:29:35.553 --> 01:29:36.814]  I know what's going on.
[01:29:36.814 --> 01:29:40.195]  They use paranoia and intimidation to make us all scared.
[01:29:40.195 --> 01:29:42.636]  The wicked flee when none pursue.
[01:29:42.636 --> 01:29:43.776]  You're not wicked, my friend.
[01:29:43.776 --> 01:29:45.097]  Don't flee.
[01:29:45.097 --> 01:29:46.217]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:29:46.217 --> 01:29:50.258]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.258 --> 01:29:51.659]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.659 --> 01:29:54.180]  The empire's on the run.

[01:30:03.917 --> 01:30:08.921]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:30:08.921 --> 01:30:16.248]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[01:33:16.172 --> 01:33:17.353]  Big Brother.
[01:33:17.353 --> 01:33:19.213]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:19.213 --> 01:33:20.793]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:20.793 --> 01:33:22.374]  You want answers?
[01:33:22.374 --> 01:33:23.974]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:23.974 --> 01:33:27.675]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:30.404 --> 01:33:38.032]  We're back.
[01:33:38.032 --> 01:33:39.774]  We're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[01:33:39.774 --> 01:33:40.295]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:40.295 --> 01:33:41.636]  Back weeknight 7 o'clock.
[01:33:41.636 --> 01:33:43.158]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:33:43.158 --> 01:33:44.659]  Back weekends 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:44.659 --> 01:33:49.064]  Central.
[01:33:49.064 --> 01:33:50.305]  All right, let me do this.
[01:33:50.305 --> 01:33:51.427]  Callers are all over the map.
[01:33:51.427 --> 01:33:52.228]  That's fine with me.
[01:33:53.743 --> 01:33:59.150]  But I do want to try to get to some of the news issues here.
[01:33:59.150 --> 01:34:04.757]  And when I say first-time callers, wide open phones, any topic, it does take us in a wild card direction.
[01:34:06.033 --> 01:34:09.275]  And so that's why I do it, but I just want to keep each caller about a minute and a half now.
[01:34:09.275 --> 01:34:16.779]  I'll take five or six more, and then I've got to get into all the economic news, the police state news, the Monsanto Protection Act that Obama has signed.
[01:34:16.779 --> 01:34:20.861]  That's up at InfoWars.com with Mike Adams, the health ranger, breaking that down.
[01:34:20.861 --> 01:34:22.562]  We're going to be going over all things.
[01:34:22.562 --> 01:34:27.965]  Let's get Mike Adams on the next few days, either via Skype or in studio, if he can do it, to break down this bill.
[01:34:27.965 --> 01:34:31.167]  I've gone over it, but I want to talk about how big this is.
[01:34:31.167 --> 01:34:31.868]  Just amazing.
[01:34:33.193 --> 01:34:35.334]  Just absolutely amazing when I get into that.
[01:34:35.334 --> 01:34:39.156]  But right now, let's go to Roger in Nevada.
[01:34:39.156 --> 01:34:41.417]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:34:41.417 --> 01:34:42.178]  Yes, Alex.
[01:34:42.178 --> 01:34:43.378]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:34:43.378 --> 01:34:47.900]  I just want to say you're a true American patriot, and I like the way you do your program.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:51.602]  Also, it's an honor and a privilege to be on the air with you.
[01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:55.424]  Please don't take me from the Silver State, brother.
[01:34:55.424 --> 01:34:59.786]  Well, I always want to compliment you, because I've been listening to you for the last three months.
[01:35:00.576 --> 01:35:03.961]  And I learned a lot from you and what I do is I take that out.
[01:35:04.628 --> 01:35:07.630]  And I fight the spiritual warfare like with you.
[01:35:07.630 --> 01:35:09.171]  I fight the Northern Order crowd like what you do.
[01:35:09.171 --> 01:35:10.792]  I'm standing right beside you.
[01:35:10.792 --> 01:35:12.073]  I want to let you know that.
[01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:20.599]  And I learned a lot from his program about the Catholic Church trying to disarm America and also Franklin Graham.
[01:35:34.968 --> 01:35:37.370]  And remember, the Vatican's its own country.
[01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:39.011]  That's a foreign country.
[01:35:39.011 --> 01:35:41.132]  And again, I don't have some thing against Catholics.
[01:35:41.132 --> 01:35:41.853]  Everybody knows that.
[01:35:41.853 --> 01:35:45.735]  I'm trying to bring everybody together, but they got something.
[01:35:45.735 --> 01:35:47.817]  The new Pope wants a carbon tax.
[01:35:47.817 --> 01:35:52.920]  I mean, I'm sorry, I'm not going to pay Al Gore money because the pontiff says so.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.781]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:35:55.053 --> 01:35:55.833]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:35:55.833 --> 01:36:02.655]  Like it says in the Bible, there'll be a lot of false prophets rising out of the church ages in the last days.
[01:36:02.655 --> 01:36:04.475]  And I was just going like, wow.
[01:36:04.475 --> 01:36:07.356]  And so I tell people about it, get people informed.
[01:36:07.356 --> 01:36:10.076]  Like it says, it's finally shot me an iron, brother.
[01:36:10.076 --> 01:36:12.277]  And I'm telling you, I'm right with you.
[01:36:12.277 --> 01:36:15.517]  And it's like I said, it's an honor and privilege to be on the air with you.
[01:36:15.517 --> 01:36:17.778]  And I just want to tell you to keep up the good work.
[01:36:18.257 --> 01:36:19.378]  I hear you my friend.
[01:36:19.378 --> 01:36:20.439]  I appreciate your call.
[01:36:20.439 --> 01:36:21.580]  Let's go to Corey in Texas.
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:22.541]  You're on the air.
[01:36:22.541 --> 01:36:22.921]  Go ahead.
[01:36:33.106 --> 01:36:35.548]  Hey, Alex, I appreciate you taking the time to take my call.
[01:36:35.548 --> 01:36:36.309]  Please don't thank me.
[01:36:36.309 --> 01:36:38.350]  I'm not an egomaniac, narcissist.
[01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:41.052]  You don't need to thank me for taking your call.
[01:36:41.052 --> 01:36:45.876]  I know you've got to beg screeners, beg the host with all the other shows, not mine.
[01:36:45.876 --> 01:36:48.078]  I appreciate you loving Liberty.
[01:36:48.078 --> 01:36:49.039]  Thank you for calling.
[01:36:49.039 --> 01:36:50.179]  Go ahead.
[01:36:50.179 --> 01:36:51.540]  I'm fighting for Liberty, brother.
[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:53.402]  I plugged in this event.
[01:36:53.402 --> 01:36:54.403]  It's going to be a huge event.
[01:36:54.403 --> 01:36:56.284]  We got 14 speakers.
[01:36:56.284 --> 01:37:00.908]  It's out at the Quick Trip Ballpark in Arlington or actually Grand Prairie, Texas.
[01:37:00.908 --> 01:37:02.329]  It's not this Saturday, but next.
[01:37:02.827 --> 01:37:09.949]  We got Kathy Glass, David Simpson, Jay Steng from Oath Keepers, Terry Hall, Frank Kuchar, a list of liberty lovers.
[01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:11.530]  Sure, just tell me the name of the event.
[01:37:11.530 --> 01:37:12.890]  What is it?
[01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:15.411]  It's called Standing Together for Liberty.
[01:37:15.411 --> 01:37:17.492]  And then how do you find, uh, how do you find the tales?
[01:37:18.413 --> 01:37:20.274]  You can go on Facebook if you like.
[01:37:20.274 --> 01:37:23.196]  I've emailed y'all's staff a couple times.
[01:37:23.196 --> 01:37:26.518]  It's Saturday, April 6th at the Quick Drip Ballpark.
[01:37:26.518 --> 01:37:27.599]  Absolutely.
[01:37:27.599 --> 01:37:29.180]  Well listen, good to hear from you.
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:34.524]  What people should do is, everyone in the country should be looking for Liberty events in their area.
[01:37:35.919 --> 01:37:36.540]  Can you hear me?
[01:37:57.569 --> 01:37:58.509]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:37:58.509 --> 01:37:59.710]  My name's also Alex.
[01:37:59.710 --> 01:38:01.851]  Great name means defender of mankind.
[01:38:01.851 --> 01:38:03.251]  I don't know if you knew that.
[01:38:03.251 --> 01:38:04.512]  Sure, I know what my name is.
[01:38:04.512 --> 01:38:05.052]  Sure, thank you.
[01:38:05.052 --> 01:38:07.112]  Yeah, I'm calling you from Chi-Rac.
[01:38:07.112 --> 01:38:09.853]  That's what the police here call Chicago nowadays.
[01:38:09.853 --> 01:38:11.494]  Chi-Rac.
[01:38:11.494 --> 01:38:12.414]  So, I was calling.
[01:38:12.414 --> 01:38:17.596]  I'm pretty familiar with all this type of black ops and chi-ops stuff.
[01:38:17.596 --> 01:38:22.958]  I want to ask you, though, how deep does the rabbit hole really go?
[01:38:22.958 --> 01:38:24.919]  How deep does the rabbit hole go?
[01:38:24.919 --> 01:38:25.559]  In what respect?
[01:38:26.656 --> 01:38:29.197]  Like, tell me some stuff from the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:38:29.197 --> 01:38:36.158]  I know you get out there sometimes with alien stuff, and supernatural stuff, and religious stuff.
[01:38:36.158 --> 01:38:37.979]  Tell me some really out there stuff.
[01:38:37.979 --> 01:38:43.920]  Well, you know, you know the Fleetwood Mac song?
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.741]  I forget the name of it, where she goes, oh, here it comes again, the Crystal Vision.
[01:38:47.741 --> 01:38:50.422]  I keep my visions to myself.
[01:38:52.412 --> 01:39:02.961]  I can't get people to admit that there's two billion bullets they've bought, that we're going into a classic police state, that they're spying on us without warrants, when it's all admitted.
[01:39:02.961 --> 01:39:14.932]  That our government's running Al-Qaeda publicly worldwide and they admit it and put out white papers at the Council on Foreign Relations, our real government, corporate government, saying we need Al-Qaeda.
[01:39:14.932 --> 01:39:15.433]  That's a quote.
[01:39:16.377 --> 01:39:19.398]  Four months ago in their white paper, admitting they run it.
[01:39:19.398 --> 01:39:21.399]  This is the type of stuff we're talking about.
[01:39:21.399 --> 01:39:40.828]  So, we're on a planet, two-thirds of the way out, on the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with hundreds of billions of photographed galaxies, and now hundreds of billions past those, and they're now finding clusters of hundreds of billions of galaxies past those, where there's hundreds of billions of hundreds of billions of hundreds of billions of whole clusters of galaxies.
[01:39:41.548 --> 01:39:56.219]  And so we're here able to consciously recognize this, able to consciously build technology that can see this, and we're able to, the most important thing we can do is recognize wholesomeness and recognize beauty and recognize the beauty of the sound of the sea.
[01:39:56.219 --> 01:39:58.861]  That is the connection to the universe.
[01:39:58.861 --> 01:40:08.188]  That is the beginning of understanding what our true potential is, is that we are sentient, conscious beings with souls who can commune
[01:40:08.928 --> 01:40:14.111]  with God, and the evidence of God is in the firmament, is in the stars.
[01:40:14.111 --> 01:40:14.692]  Okay?
[01:40:14.692 --> 01:40:17.673]  I'm not trying to get religious here, folks, but people need to understand.
[01:40:17.673 --> 01:40:19.775]  Transcend the New World Order.
[01:40:19.775 --> 01:40:20.695]  Transcend it.
[01:40:20.695 --> 01:40:20.995]  Okay?
[01:40:20.995 --> 01:40:23.957]  There is and are dark entities in the universe.
[01:40:23.957 --> 01:40:24.798]  That's undoubtable.
[01:40:24.798 --> 01:40:33.163]  There are forces of darkness that loved ugly things, and love piles of dead children, and rotten meat, and planets that are dead, and darkness.
[01:40:33.163 --> 01:40:33.923]  Okay?
[01:40:33.923 --> 01:40:34.964]  And we don't like that.
[01:40:34.964 --> 01:40:35.805]  Okay?
[01:40:35.805 --> 01:40:36.665]  You can say whatever you want.
[01:40:36.665 --> 01:40:37.145]  It's there.
[01:40:37.145 --> 01:40:37.386]  Okay?
[01:40:37.386 --> 01:40:37.846]  Looking at us.
[01:40:38.286 --> 01:40:42.390]  We want to go with the regenerative life.
[01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.830]  Okay?
[01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:45.512]  And if you look at the New World Order, what flows out of it?
[01:40:45.512 --> 01:40:48.595]  How it loves us, how it loves life, how it's sweet, how it's cute.
[01:40:48.595 --> 01:40:51.117]  But it's pure lies, pure deception, pure death.
[01:40:51.117 --> 01:40:59.784]  So at the bottom of the rabbit hole is death and the end of life and darkness forever.
[01:40:59.784 --> 01:41:01.525]  Absolute zero.
[01:41:01.525 --> 01:41:03.147]  The center of hell is frozen.
[01:41:04.235 --> 01:41:08.018]  It's frozen in Dante's Inferno, but I don't need to read Dante's Inferno.
[01:41:08.018 --> 01:41:16.044]  My soul, looking out into studying evil and studying good, it is absolute zero.
[01:41:16.044 --> 01:41:19.366]  It is devoid of heat, of life, of everything.
[01:41:19.366 --> 01:41:22.109]  Okay, that's the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:26.792]  Absolute raw power against creation, against God.
[01:41:26.792 --> 01:41:28.453]  The devil hates life.
[01:41:28.453 --> 01:41:30.975]  All those that hate me love death, Christ said.
[01:41:30.975 --> 01:41:31.536]  All those
[01:41:32.827 --> 01:41:34.569]  That hate me love death.
[01:41:34.569 --> 01:41:36.611]  All those that hate me love death.
[01:41:36.611 --> 01:41:37.232]  That's it.
[01:41:37.232 --> 01:41:38.033]  Death.
[01:41:38.033 --> 01:41:39.354]  Death is at the bottom.
[01:41:39.354 --> 01:41:40.255]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:40.255 --> 01:41:42.738]  Any other questions?
[01:41:42.738 --> 01:41:54.811]  Yeah, I was wondering if you think that this whole technology aspect of how the governments are using technology to now kind of encapsulate and control people, do you think in the future
[01:41:55.447 --> 01:42:01.132]  That that technology, the same technology, is going to backfire, such as... It's already backfiring.
[01:42:01.132 --> 01:42:01.772]  They don't care.
[01:42:01.772 --> 01:42:15.123]  I mean, in their literature, I have quotes of these top technocracy people, EU advisors, you name it, saying, we'll probably blow the earth up in our source of, you know, to go on willing and to go on dominating.
[01:42:15.123 --> 01:42:20.168]  And then say that's basically us just, just, just, just merging with power.
[01:42:21.108 --> 01:42:28.071]  And Lennon dreamed of like blowing up the earth and blowing up the solar system and he'd blow up the universe and blow up God if he could.
[01:42:28.071 --> 01:42:32.093]  It's just like, I'm a moth in the flame, oh Satan I love you.
[01:42:32.093 --> 01:42:38.957]  I mean it's just pathetic because they hate the creation force.
[01:42:38.957 --> 01:42:45.980]  I mean those of us that love it absolutely love it and just like it's such a blessing, it's so good, it's so deep.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:49.922]  It's so fathomless and incredible but to these people, to these creatures,
[01:42:52.799 --> 01:42:53.500]  I appreciate your call.
[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:56.804]  You know what's in the rabbit hole?
[01:42:56.804 --> 01:43:03.873]  At the bottom of the rabbit hole, right before you hit the bottom in total implosion and mass death, you see what you see in Japan.
[01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:06.099]  It's now taken over the whole culture.
[01:43:06.099 --> 01:43:10.544]  Bloomberg reported last year, I already knew about this, never talked about it, but this is in Bloomberg, I'll talk about it.
[01:43:10.544 --> 01:43:16.050]  The number one seller in the country, outside of baby diapers, it's surpassed that, is adult diapers.
[01:43:16.050 --> 01:43:18.172]  Not for an aging population.
[01:43:18.172 --> 01:43:24.339]  Japanese that were always into cleanliness and the cleanest people in the world, they like to desecrate themselves and poop in their pants.
[01:43:25.878 --> 01:43:40.847]  Uh, and, and, and in vending machines everywhere, I was talking to Man Cow about this, he goes to Japan twice a year, you know, for shows and things he does, and there's vending machines everywhere with, with, with, with, you've got kids listening, I don't have them listening right now, with, with underwear with full loads of them.
[01:43:40.847 --> 01:43:43.289]  You know, that's a baked potato fully loaded.
[01:43:43.289 --> 01:43:46.731]  Uh, and with a picture of the woman who did it.
[01:43:48.144 --> 01:43:56.607]  And supplanting the major bars everywhere, it will soon be the dominant bar, is bars where you go in and people defecate on you.
[01:43:56.607 --> 01:43:59.829]  Now that happened in Sodom and Gomorrah, it happened everywhere else.
[01:43:59.829 --> 01:44:05.411]  When you get to that point, the next point is mass human sacrifice, burning cities and total Satan worship.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.683]  And then plagues and disease and everyone just stumbling around drinking blood.
[01:44:10.683 --> 01:44:16.928]  I mean, that's why everybody's into zombies now, and that's why, because you know that's next, okay?
[01:44:16.928 --> 01:44:28.937]  And it's happened hundreds of times in history, and now poop bars are all over the United States, and eating poop, and you're not trendy if you don't do it, and you're hurting people's civil rights.
[01:44:29.617 --> 01:44:32.980]  And HIV and AIDS is just exploding.
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:35.783]  And if you say, you know, that's really bad for the, quote, gay community.
[01:44:35.783 --> 01:44:37.184]  That's a destructive lifestyle.
[01:44:37.184 --> 01:44:38.866]  They say, oh, you're just against me.
[01:44:38.866 --> 01:44:39.286]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:39.286 --> 01:44:41.869]  And I'm really shocked by the fact that you like the same sex.
[01:44:41.869 --> 01:44:44.171]  Oh, I can't handle it because I'm such a square.
[01:44:44.171 --> 01:44:44.832]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:44.832 --> 01:44:46.873]  No, I care about you.
[01:44:46.873 --> 01:44:49.276]  And you dredge a tree by its fruits.
[01:44:49.276 --> 01:44:51.658]  That is destructive.
[01:44:51.658 --> 01:44:53.340]  And heterosexuals are doing all that stuff, too.
[01:44:54.423 --> 01:44:58.725]  I mean, this is, and I hate to talk about stuff like that, but you ask what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:44:58.725 --> 01:45:09.750]  You fall all the way down the pit, and it's, at the bottom, it, it, it, for the general public, it's desecrating themselves, and hurting their bodies, and jabbing things through themselves, and that's what happened in every culture.
[01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:15.193]  You know, Moses comes down from the mountain, everybody's dancing around, cutting themselves, and killing little kids and everything.
[01:45:15.193 --> 01:45:16.814]  I mean, you know, it's the same deal.
[01:45:16.814 --> 01:45:19.715]  He's gone a couple days, comes back down, they're all devil-worshipping.
[01:45:19.715 --> 01:45:20.075]  Okay?
[01:45:20.075 --> 01:45:25.238]  I mean, you know, that's what goes on, that's what happens, that's where it goes, that's where it leads.
[01:45:25.238 --> 01:45:27.179]  You ask, where does the rabbit hole lead?
[01:45:27.179 --> 01:45:35.964]  It leads to human sacrifice, torture of children, genetic engineering, monsters, babies being added to Pepsi as flavoring, and it's just not even news.
[01:45:35.964 --> 01:45:36.785]  Like, okay, big deal.
[01:45:38.049 --> 01:45:39.750]  Yeah, you're wrong.
[01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:41.430]  It's cool to drink babies.
[01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:49.334]  It's cool that women go into the doctors and have melted down dead Chinese babies, injected into their lips, and suicide nets, and mass Satanism.
[01:45:49.334 --> 01:45:55.837]  And you think by getting into it, and agreeing with it, and, yeah, we're sick, yeah, so what?
[01:45:55.837 --> 01:45:58.058]  You think you've got, like, power over it now.
[01:45:58.058 --> 01:46:03.780]  And you just let that spiritual hand reach right out and wrap around you, and it's just taking you right toward its mouth.
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:05.761]  You're like, oh, yeah.
[01:46:10.302 --> 01:46:13.022]  And then it itself, a bigger demon, just reaches down and grabs it.
[01:46:13.022 --> 01:46:14.563]  Just bites right in.
[01:46:14.563 --> 01:46:16.143]  And that's what it's all about.
[01:46:16.143 --> 01:46:22.465]  Two globalists all hooked up with fake copies of themselves online in the big mega frames that aren't even real.
[01:46:22.465 --> 01:46:27.166]  Delusions of themselves that they're eternal when all they've done is given up their humanity and their soul and spirit.
[01:46:28.326 --> 01:46:43.459]  Two global technocracies, you know, two entities, two humanoids at the end of it, jacketed into giant technological systems with giant robot wars with each other, trying to defeat the other to be the one prime entity.
[01:46:43.459 --> 01:46:47.022]  That's at the bottom of the rabbit hole, and it'll never get there.
[01:46:47.022 --> 01:46:49.144]  Because God will intervene before that.
[01:46:49.144 --> 01:46:51.726]  But not before you've seen where technocracy leads you.
[01:46:51.726 --> 01:46:54.648]  Not before you've seen absolute hell on earth.
[01:46:54.648 --> 01:46:56.130]  Not before you've begged
[01:46:57.319 --> 01:47:00.302]  And the whole world's had an example of what all this does.
[01:47:00.302 --> 01:47:05.107]  Then humanity goes forward.
[01:47:05.107 --> 01:47:09.952]  That's what you get when you ask where the rabbit hole ends.
[01:47:09.952 --> 01:47:12.314]  Oh my gosh.
[01:47:12.314 --> 01:47:16.799]  John the Revelator marveled at the beast.
[01:47:16.799 --> 01:47:17.940]  He marveled.
[01:47:19.133 --> 01:47:22.536]  Marvel in that translation means just mouth hanging open.
[01:47:22.536 --> 01:47:28.060]  Can you imagine somebody 2,000 years ago, what we now see unfolding, being beamed into their head?
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:29.541]  Here, so people have a warning.
[01:47:29.541 --> 01:47:30.402]  This is what's going to happen.
[01:47:30.402 --> 01:47:36.566]  Can you imagine seeing all this and what's going to happen and just rolling around on the ground for days like John did?
[01:47:36.566 --> 01:47:39.789]  Is it just all beamed right into his brain?
[01:47:39.789 --> 01:47:41.970]  Let's go ahead and take another phone call.
[01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:43.912]  Jason in West Virginia.
[01:47:43.912 --> 01:47:44.733]  You're on the air.
[01:47:44.733 --> 01:47:46.534]  Go ahead.
[01:47:46.534 --> 01:47:47.695]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:47.695 --> 01:47:47.975]  Welcome.
[01:47:49.198 --> 01:47:54.943]  Hey man, uh, here last Saturday, I just got, uh, me and my wife got arrested.
[01:47:54.943 --> 01:48:03.030]  We were shooting on farmland and next thing you know there's a bunch of sheriffs and SWAT teams pulled out at like 11 o'clock at night.
[01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:04.711]  What were you doing?
[01:48:04.711 --> 01:48:05.312]  Shooting guns.
[01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:06.333]  Yeah, that's what I thought you said.
[01:48:06.333 --> 01:48:07.594]  The phone popped.
[01:48:07.594 --> 01:48:11.437]  Oh no, no, no, nowadays if you're even on your own land in Montana, the cops show up.
[01:48:11.437 --> 01:48:12.538]  Guns are evil.
[01:48:12.538 --> 01:48:14.259]  They're gonna teach you they're dirty and bad.
[01:48:14.259 --> 01:48:14.780]  So what happened?
[01:48:15.626 --> 01:48:16.747]  There's a purge.
[01:48:16.747 --> 01:48:19.950]  Homeland Security now admits they're aimed at gun owners.
[01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:21.531]  Homeland Security's not for Al Qaeda.
[01:48:21.531 --> 01:48:22.032]  It's for you.
[01:48:22.032 --> 01:48:23.593]  Go ahead.
[01:48:23.593 --> 01:48:29.718]  They're sitting there saying that we can't wait for something to happen so we can repossess these guns.
[01:48:29.718 --> 01:48:31.060]  I was like, man, look.
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:33.201]  What smart attitudes, you know?
[01:48:33.201 --> 01:48:35.383]  So you're in West Virginia.
[01:48:35.383 --> 01:48:36.324]  The cops show up.
[01:48:36.324 --> 01:48:38.026]  I mean, how big is the property?
[01:48:38.026 --> 01:48:40.268]  Where are you at?
[01:48:40.268 --> 01:48:42.169]  We're on 20 acres.
[01:48:43.752 --> 01:48:44.612]  Well, I don't know what happened.
[01:48:44.612 --> 01:48:46.954]  They've never explained anything to us.
[01:48:46.954 --> 01:48:48.894]  We were shooting at hay bales.
[01:49:01.308 --> 01:49:09.530]  Yeah, listen, everybody I know out in the countryside, where there's like 200-acre ranchettes, 20-acre, 5-acre, you know, I've got less than 10 acres, will be a thing.
[01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:15.111]  I mean, the neighbors are all, I've talked to the neighbors, the cops come now when people shoot on 100 acres.
[01:49:15.111 --> 01:49:23.033]  Because they've now built, you know, miles away some neighborhoods, and the cops come in Texas and act like on a 100-acre, you know, your own land.
[01:49:23.033 --> 01:49:26.774]  And my neighbors have got like a berm and hay bales, and family comes and shoots.
[01:49:26.774 --> 01:49:29.095]  I've talked to the other neighbor, who's actually a famous guy,
[01:49:30.095 --> 01:49:37.057]  Uh, and they've had trouble, uh, and, uh, it's just bizarre that, but it's not bizarre.
[01:49:37.057 --> 01:49:38.958]  They are teaching us that we're bad.
[01:49:38.958 --> 01:49:40.558]  Go ahead.
[01:49:40.558 --> 01:49:45.320]  Well, I mean, to do, do you think I should get most of my guns out of my house and put them somewhere?
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.820]  Because I'm afraid they're going to come raid my house.
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:48.120]  Well, listen, here's the deal.
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:56.063]  Um, well, I mean, let me think for a minute, because I'm trying to give you this answer here, because I don't know all your particulars.
[01:49:56.063 --> 01:49:56.623]  Here's the issue.
[01:49:58.402 --> 01:50:05.745]  If the cops had to show up because people were scared and called them because they think gunfire is illegal, just like people call cops on you if you have a gun case in your house in Texas.
[01:50:05.745 --> 01:50:07.485]  I mean, you know, you want to get a SWAT team, right?
[01:50:07.485 --> 01:50:11.407]  The cable guy saw you had an AR-15, and so they SWAT team you.
[01:50:11.407 --> 01:50:12.787]  It's a legal AR-15.
[01:50:12.787 --> 01:50:13.427]  You're going to jail!
[01:50:13.427 --> 01:50:13.867]  They don't care.
[01:50:13.867 --> 01:50:15.028]  They'll find something.
[01:50:15.028 --> 01:50:18.669]  I see arrests in the news every day for what they call arsenals that are like, he had 20 guns.
[01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:19.789]  Totally legal?
[01:50:19.789 --> 01:50:20.210]  Veteran?
[01:50:20.210 --> 01:50:20.650]  Go to jail!
[01:50:21.610 --> 01:50:23.472]  They take people's kids for not taking shots.
[01:50:23.472 --> 01:50:24.133]  There's no law.
[01:50:24.133 --> 01:50:24.634]  They don't care.
[01:50:24.634 --> 01:50:29.179]  They got a family court that'll have that kid getting raped in a pedophile den by, you know, the next day.
[01:50:29.179 --> 01:50:30.861]  I mean, you know, they're here to hurt America.
[01:50:30.861 --> 01:50:32.303]  They're here to kill you and your family.
[01:50:32.303 --> 01:50:37.649]  They're here to inject vaccines in you and kill your baby and then arrest you when they kill your baby.
[01:50:37.649 --> 01:50:41.213]  Even if the baby has a convulsion in the hospital, they're going to put you in jail.
[01:50:41.934 --> 01:50:43.416]  Because that's, they like it!
[01:50:43.416 --> 01:50:47.501]  Now the others are just mindless idiots who don't even know, and notice they're part of this.
[01:50:47.501 --> 01:50:52.026]  But you've got the evil ones there, who run in the team under them, know full well what they're doing.
[01:50:52.026 --> 01:50:54.890]  So, when we come back I gotta talk to you, then I'll get to the news.
[01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:57.933]  Because you're sitting there talking about something very, very important here.
[01:50:57.933 --> 01:51:00.016]  The cops, what they said, it's that they were...
[01:51:01.693 --> 01:51:05.477]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[01:51:05.477 --> 01:51:08.741]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.

[01:53:50.226 --> 01:53:51.946]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I
[01:54:13.726 --> 01:54:15.967]  I liken it to this.
[01:54:15.967 --> 01:54:22.449]  It's like knowing people are breaking into your neighbor's house and you run up and they're banging on their front door saying, I see people breaking in the back.
[01:54:22.449 --> 01:54:25.070]  Your neighbor's like, what are you so upset about?
[01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:31.873]  I can't help get wound up here on air because I'm here warning millions of people about what's going on.
[01:54:31.873 --> 01:54:37.675]  And it sounds crazy to say that
[01:54:39.633 --> 01:54:46.035]  They're killing kids all over America right now post-abortion, you know, one-year-olds, two-year-olds with vaccines, but they kill a lot of them.
[01:54:46.035 --> 01:54:47.416]  They don't just brain damage them.
[01:54:47.416 --> 01:54:52.597]  And then they're going to put you in jail when they do the autopsy and your kid's got blood on the brain.
[01:54:52.597 --> 01:54:55.118]  And by the way, those doctors see that stuff all the time.
[01:54:55.118 --> 01:54:57.979]  Those coroners, they know the vaccine killed them.
[01:54:57.979 --> 01:55:01.060]  They're going to put you in jail because that's how they keep their job.
[01:55:02.466 --> 01:55:05.947]  All cultures human sacrifice when they're under this spell.
[01:55:05.947 --> 01:55:07.107]  Every culture does it.
[01:55:07.107 --> 01:55:12.328]  Every culture does human sacrifice during this decline period, during this part of the cycle.
[01:55:12.328 --> 01:55:25.870]  And here they do it with abortion, and then now you hear about the bioethics boards all over the country, the death panels, saying, well a homeless guy came in who had a heart attack and we're not going to give him surgery, we're going to let him die.
[01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:27.651]  You see that in the news.
[01:55:27.651 --> 01:55:29.091]  And they're like, well maybe that's a good thing.
[01:55:30.677 --> 01:55:31.978]  They're dehumanizing you.
[01:55:31.978 --> 01:55:38.080]  The state troopers started pulling women over, no evidence, no nothing, with dirty gloves going in their bodies.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:41.261]  The head of the state police said, that's fine, that's our new policy.
[01:55:41.261 --> 01:55:45.443]  The grand jury said, the law says you can't do that, you're going to jail, they've indicted them.
[01:55:45.443 --> 01:55:54.766]  See, but they were like, hey, that's nothing wrong with that, and if we would have bought that PSYOP, what do you do past sticking your hand with the same glove in multiple people?
[01:55:54.766 --> 01:55:58.588]  Inside their bodies, you could see them with force.
[01:56:00.313 --> 01:56:04.235]  Raping a woman, two women on the side of the road, physically, with their hand.
[01:56:04.235 --> 01:56:06.516]  I hate to talk like that.
[01:56:06.516 --> 01:56:13.140]  But see how they just, you know, the state police local captain and then the commander said, that's fine, I approve of that.
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:18.042]  And then it went up to the head of the state police and they said, oh yeah, that's a good thing, we're going to do that to you now.
[01:56:18.042 --> 01:56:22.885]  And the public freaked out and said, you're not going to do that to us.
[01:56:22.885 --> 01:56:23.825]  We're going to resist.
[01:56:23.825 --> 01:56:25.786]  And they went, oh, we're going to indict them, right?
[01:56:25.786 --> 01:56:26.547]  But they'll be back.
[01:56:26.547 --> 01:56:27.047]  They'll be back.
[01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:31.902]  And again, it's not that the average state police are even bad, they're being ordered to do this.
[01:56:31.902 --> 01:56:34.529]  They're seeing what they'll do, because they've now been federalized.
[01:56:34.529 --> 01:56:35.111]  Behind the scenes.
[01:56:36.323 --> 01:56:41.706]  Now, briefly, I want to finish your story, then I'm going to cover news and I'll go back to all the callers that are patiently holding.
[01:56:41.706 --> 01:56:42.846]  But Jason, how did it end?
[01:56:42.846 --> 01:56:48.449]  I mean, the issue here isn't that cops came because neighbors were scared you were shooting guns on 20 acres of the country.
[01:56:48.449 --> 01:56:53.311]  The issue is that the cops said to you, we can't wait till something goes wrong with your guns.
[01:56:53.311 --> 01:56:54.112]  We're going to take them.
[01:56:54.112 --> 01:56:57.313]  I mean, imagine if you said, well, we can't wait till you do something wrong someday.
[01:56:57.313 --> 01:56:58.374]  We're going to take yours.
[01:56:58.374 --> 01:57:00.775]  He would have arrested you for a terroristic threat.
[01:57:00.775 --> 01:57:03.096]  So you were there being terrorized by these people.
[01:57:03.096 --> 01:57:04.297]  What else did they say to you?
[01:57:04.297 --> 01:57:04.697]  Tell me now.
[01:57:05.117 --> 01:57:08.558]  Well, he said that they wanted to keep them for themselves.
[01:57:08.558 --> 01:57:12.859]  So, I mean, they can't wait until something happens because we're going to get them and we're going to keep them for ourselves.
[01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:15.100]  So, I was like, yeah, okay, whatever.
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:16.160]  What town do you live in?
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:18.801]  Martinsburg.
[01:57:18.801 --> 01:57:21.902]  Is Boss Hogg the mayor?
[01:57:21.902 --> 01:57:23.862]  Yeah, right.
[01:57:23.862 --> 01:57:25.463]  I don't know what goes on around here, man.
[01:57:25.463 --> 01:57:26.463]  I try to keep to myself.
[01:57:27.196 --> 01:57:29.197]  Well, I wouldn't do that.
[01:57:29.197 --> 01:57:46.644]  I would go in, I would go file, I would go file a criminal complaint of a terroristic threat, and I'd do it with witnesses, and I would go hand flyers out all over town, and I'd call the local media, and say, I mean, hey, give us your story, give us their names, give it to us, take photos of what happened, give it to us, we'll write a story about it, buddy.
[01:57:46.644 --> 01:57:54.207]  Give us the proof that police said we can't wait to take your guns, because I know that's the kind of stuff that bad ones do, and that's how you respond to them.
[01:57:54.927 --> 01:57:58.490]  They came after you because nobody knows who you are.
[01:57:58.490 --> 01:57:58.930]  Yeah.
[01:57:58.930 --> 01:58:05.695]  I will assure you if your granddaddy was the... I mean, they didn't even know if your granddaddy had been a county judge and they'd been like, we're not going out there.
[01:58:05.695 --> 01:58:07.657]  Yeah.
[01:58:07.657 --> 01:58:12.880]  Alright, buddy, what are you doing?
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:15.702]  Working a backhoe or something while you're on the air?
[01:58:15.702 --> 01:58:18.605]  I'm driving an 18-wheeler.
[01:58:18.605 --> 01:58:20.066]  Hey, they got a computer that can do that.
[01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:22.311]  And you know what they're going to do?
[01:58:22.311 --> 01:58:26.313]  They're going to have the robot cars, they're going to say they're safer, and ban humans driving them.
[01:58:26.313 --> 01:58:27.394]  How's that sound?
[01:58:27.394 --> 01:58:29.415]  Sounds like we better realize who our enemy is.
[01:58:29.415 --> 01:58:30.736]  They're replacing humanity.
[01:58:30.736 --> 01:58:33.118]  They think they're getting us to replace ourselves.
[01:58:33.118 --> 01:58:34.839]  Wake up to the technocracy.
[01:58:34.839 --> 01:58:35.759]  Hour number three.

[01:59:56.437 --> 01:59:59.198]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.816 --> 02:00:07.117]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.117 --> 02:00:08.898]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.898 --> 02:00:10.660]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:12.221]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.221 --> 02:00:13.782]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.782 --> 02:00:17.965]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.965 --> 02:00:22.989]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.989 --> 02:00:25.211]  Kurt Nemo's got an important article.
[02:00:25.211 --> 02:00:30.114]  Biden, Senate, gun bill vote only.
[02:00:30.114 --> 02:00:30.595]  The beginning.
[02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:37.712]  Of course, they're going to ban all our guns incrementally every time there's a mass shooting, even though statistically it's very rare.
[02:00:37.712 --> 02:00:46.895]  They're going to collectively blame us until we stand up and say, listen criminals, stop collectively blaming us for what you probably have been staging and stop running Al Qaeda in Libya.
[02:00:46.895 --> 02:00:47.876]  You know, mix issues.
[02:00:49.042 --> 02:00:51.283]  We know this is a criminal takeover.
[02:00:51.283 --> 02:00:56.544]  Oh, it discredits Alex when he says the government wants everybody's guns and that they're arming their teeth against us.
[02:00:56.544 --> 02:00:58.844]  But don't have him back on and nobody talk like that.
[02:00:58.844 --> 02:00:59.885]  It's discrediting.
[02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:01.125]  No.
[02:01:01.125 --> 02:01:05.386]  Please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[02:01:05.386 --> 02:01:07.246]  Well, they're using reverse psychology.
[02:01:07.246 --> 02:01:09.707]  Please throw us in the briar patch.
[02:01:09.707 --> 02:01:12.968]  Because they're actually scared to be thrown in the briar patch.
[02:01:12.968 --> 02:01:17.609]  Let's take a few calls and I promise when I start the next segment I'm going to cover a whole heaping
[02:01:19.434 --> 02:01:24.516]  Helping of a very, very important news here today, but I've kind of done the show a little bit different today.
[02:01:24.516 --> 02:01:33.100]  I've kind of gone into my preacher mode, my real native mode, and I've been taking a lot of your phone calls.
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:38.342]  They've taken us down a lot of different paths of gun owners being persecuted from Texas to West Virginia.
[02:01:38.342 --> 02:01:40.302]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in Wisconsin.
[02:01:40.302 --> 02:01:41.283]  Nick, you're on the air.
[02:01:41.283 --> 02:01:41.563]  Welcome.
[02:01:45.117 --> 02:01:46.378]  Hello, Nick.
[02:01:46.378 --> 02:01:47.439]  Hello, am I on?
[02:01:47.439 --> 02:01:48.300]  Yes, you are.
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:49.921]  All right.
[02:01:49.921 --> 02:01:54.825]  I'm gonna have to resist to thank you here, but I love your show.
[02:01:54.825 --> 02:02:00.049]  I'm a recent listener over probably the last year here.
[02:02:00.049 --> 02:02:14.200]  Since we've been awoken to all these atrocities going on across our nation, but it's so hard to not become overwhelmed with everything going on and listen to your show all the time.
[02:02:15.449 --> 02:02:28.781]  I agree totally with what you're doing and I just think every now and then people need to be uplifted and I think there's certain films I've seen some of them from from your site the one about the
[02:02:29.764 --> 02:02:38.908]  The pre-tribulation rapture exposed, I think does a good job of lifting us Christians up that God is on our side.
[02:02:38.908 --> 02:02:45.731]  And I don't know if you guys are familiar with this or not, but another video I recently seen that I think needs to get out there.
[02:02:45.731 --> 02:02:50.993]  The film is called Back to Eden Film dot com, or you can watch it for free.
[02:02:50.993 --> 02:02:54.615]  And I just believe that God
[02:02:55.578 --> 02:03:01.002]  Offered us a victory in being able to produce our own food.
[02:03:01.002 --> 02:03:06.726]  One of the hardships with getting into gardening or anything is it's a lot of work and everybody knows that.
[02:03:06.726 --> 02:03:07.646]  But it's fun!
[02:03:07.646 --> 02:03:09.488]  It's fun!
[02:03:09.488 --> 02:03:10.388]  I totally agree with you.
[02:03:10.388 --> 02:03:16.873]  Being out in nature, experiencing God through nature, you can't get any better than that.
[02:03:16.873 --> 02:03:20.175]  And I think this film is a way to
[02:03:21.426 --> 02:03:25.547]  Rejuvenate the people's spirit and getting back to that.
[02:03:25.547 --> 02:03:26.147]  I want to see it.
[02:03:26.147 --> 02:03:27.307]  Maybe they sell a DVD.
[02:03:27.307 --> 02:03:30.228]  We'll sell it if we fund ourselves by getting right.
[02:03:30.228 --> 02:03:31.748]  Maybe we'll contact them and carry it.
[02:03:31.748 --> 02:03:32.329]  I need to see it.
[02:03:32.329 --> 02:03:34.669]  But whatever I see that I think is important, we sell it.
[02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:40.070]  Infowarsstore.com so we can fund and finance ourselves, which I didn't even plug anything last hour.
[02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:41.671]  But that's how we do finance ourselves.
[02:03:41.671 --> 02:03:43.611]  So great to hear from you, my friend.
[02:03:43.611 --> 02:03:45.572]  I appreciate you calling in.
[02:03:45.572 --> 02:03:49.653]  By the way, we're carrying all of Mike Adams organic, you know, triple certified
[02:03:51.675 --> 02:03:59.414]  Products at info or store.com at the same price he sells them so you support us and Mike when you do that He's got his factory outside Austin, Texas
[02:04:00.506 --> 02:04:02.647]  Right on the edge of town, actually pretty close to here.
[02:04:02.647 --> 02:04:03.407]  The crew's been out there.
[02:04:03.407 --> 02:04:04.548]  We've got some videos about that.
[02:04:04.548 --> 02:04:07.229]  It's your purchases that make the broadcast possible.
[02:04:07.229 --> 02:04:09.810]  And we couldn't do this without you, the listeners, supporting us.
[02:04:09.810 --> 02:04:21.034]  We couldn't do it without people out there that have helped us in the media, like DrudgeReport.com and WorldNetDaily and some of the others, but mainly DrudgeReport.com magnifies what we're doing.
[02:04:22.874 --> 02:04:26.377]  I gotta say, at a level that I can't even measure.
[02:04:26.377 --> 02:04:29.559]  I know drug shows are reporting really important news.
[02:04:29.559 --> 02:04:31.300]  That's why it's up there.
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:36.424]  But still, doing the right thing, most people don't do it.
[02:04:36.424 --> 02:04:38.325]  But we appreciate that.
[02:04:38.325 --> 02:04:39.206]  We're all in this together.
[02:04:39.206 --> 02:04:40.247]  I just appreciate
[02:04:41.107 --> 02:04:46.653]  The reason I don't want to be thanked, ladies and gentlemen, is this is self-preservation you're hearing here.
[02:04:46.653 --> 02:04:51.379]  I want people to understand it's not extraordinary to wake up to this tyranny.
[02:04:51.379 --> 02:04:52.941]  This is something that's automatic.
[02:04:52.941 --> 02:04:54.743]  I mean, you've got to do it.
[02:04:54.743 --> 02:04:56.445]  It's not like going above and beyond.
[02:04:56.445 --> 02:04:57.706]  We're in trouble.
[02:04:57.706 --> 02:04:59.128]  This is just survival here.
[02:05:01.664 --> 02:05:02.744]  I had tried everything.
[02:05:02.744 --> 02:05:05.085]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:05:05.085 --> 02:05:08.226]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:05:08.226 --> 02:05:13.047]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[02:05:13.047 --> 02:05:19.909]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:05:19.909 --> 02:05:30.372]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:31.112 --> 02:05:35.593]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:05:35.593 --> 02:05:41.855]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:41.855 --> 02:05:43.415]  Now that's results.
[02:05:43.415 --> 02:05:50.217]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.

[02:07:01.152 --> 02:07:09.694]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:07:09.694 --> 02:07:13.375]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[02:07:13.375 --> 02:07:17.817]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[02:07:17.817 --> 02:07:22.878]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[02:07:22.878 --> 02:07:30.380]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus.
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:30.760]  I think so.
[02:08:21.238 --> 02:08:26.085]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:26.085 --> 02:08:27.526]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:34.386 --> 02:08:42.550]  Okay, folks, I'm going to continue with your calls at 800-259-9231, but let me go over a bunch of the news right now.
[02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:44.751]  I was just talking to Weldon Henson, who's a big shooter.
[02:08:44.751 --> 02:08:49.273]  He's gone out shooting with us before, shooting the .50 cals a few weeks ago.
[02:08:49.273 --> 02:08:53.915]  He's an Air Force veteran himself, country music singer, works here in the office for about seven years.
[02:08:53.915 --> 02:09:01.159]  A good friend of mine, he said, now I read all the, you know, hunting and shooting blogs, and he goes, all I see him talking about now is people that have 100 acres.
[02:09:02.339 --> 02:09:04.860]  200 acres, 1,000 acres.
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:14.964]  And I'm talking about in Texas, Montana, because I'm seeing the same stuff, where you'll be out there just shooting your rifle, and the cops come.
[02:09:14.964 --> 02:09:17.465]  And they want to see your guns.
[02:09:17.465 --> 02:09:23.688]  If you let them, they'll try to take photos, they'll try to get the numbers off of them, and they act like you're a criminal.
[02:09:23.688 --> 02:09:30.491]  And that's like the knock and talk that the Fed started about 20 years ago that's done all over the country now, where they come to your house,
[02:09:31.721 --> 02:09:42.586]  Mainly upper-class areas, and they do it during the day, thinking there's going to be a woman, you know, here running the house, you know, the guy's off working, there's going to be some wealthy or middle-class woman here.
[02:09:42.586 --> 02:09:49.789]  You've seen them when they come to install the smart meters and cut locks, go in, put them on the side, arrest women that videotape them on their own property.
[02:09:49.789 --> 02:09:50.669]  This is the new America.
[02:09:50.669 --> 02:09:52.030]  This is the new North Korea.
[02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:56.692]  You know, they detain a Fox reporter, and it's national news in China.
[02:09:57.412 --> 02:09:59.915]  That's like those dirty commies, but here it's like, good!
[02:09:59.915 --> 02:10:02.337]  Throw that woman in prison!
[02:10:02.337 --> 02:10:06.901]  And yeah, now the cops will show up, not everywhere, but more and more because they're told to.
[02:10:06.901 --> 02:10:11.265]  And say, hi, do you mind if... This has been in the Dallas Morning News in Dallas, in nice areas.
[02:10:11.265 --> 02:10:13.808]  They go, hi, we're just doing a survey, knock and talk.
[02:10:13.808 --> 02:10:16.651]  What kind of firearms you got in there?
[02:10:16.651 --> 02:10:17.391]  Well, I don't know.
[02:10:17.391 --> 02:10:18.793]  Mind if we come in and look at them?
[02:10:19.821 --> 02:10:21.262]  Well, is there an investigation officer?
[02:10:21.262 --> 02:10:26.767]  There's one case they went to a lawyer's house, and the woman was a well-known lawyer in Dallas.
[02:10:26.767 --> 02:10:28.508]  That's why there was actually a news article about it.
[02:10:28.508 --> 02:10:29.950]  But the news was like, oh, it's good.
[02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:32.372]  She's wrong to be filing a complaint.
[02:10:32.372 --> 02:10:33.272]  This is a good idea.
[02:10:33.272 --> 02:10:35.815]  They're like, we'd like to come in and see your firearms.
[02:10:35.815 --> 02:10:37.916]  Well, is there an investigation officer?
[02:10:37.916 --> 02:10:38.537]  Nope.
[02:10:38.537 --> 02:10:39.618]  We just want to come in and look at those.
[02:10:39.618 --> 02:10:40.499]  Well, you got something to hide?
[02:10:42.182 --> 02:10:43.663]  Shows your husband does this.
[02:10:43.663 --> 02:10:45.343]  What do you do?
[02:10:45.343 --> 02:10:46.444]  Again, is this an investigation?
[02:10:46.444 --> 02:10:47.964]  Do you have a warrant?
[02:10:47.964 --> 02:10:48.404]  No, we don't!
[02:10:48.404 --> 02:10:50.525]  We just thought you'd want to work with us a little bit.
[02:10:50.525 --> 02:10:51.426]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:10:51.426 --> 02:10:52.366]  Oh, it's back!
[02:10:52.366 --> 02:10:53.526]  WFAA.com.
[02:10:53.526 --> 02:10:54.727]  The guys just Googled it.
[02:10:54.727 --> 02:10:58.248]  Dallas Police Relaunch Knock and Talk Initiative.
[02:10:58.248 --> 02:10:59.569]  And look at those young cops.
[02:10:59.569 --> 02:11:02.090]  You know, I mean, those guys look like they're Boy Scouts.
[02:11:02.090 --> 02:11:03.290]  And man, they are crazed.
[02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:06.511]  Boy, they come to your house and you are... You know what you are?
[02:11:06.511 --> 02:11:07.572]  Enemy number one.
[02:11:09.292 --> 02:11:13.335]  Man, this country's... I mean, they've got the official Catholic Church saying, ban all guns.
[02:11:13.335 --> 02:11:15.116]  Southern Baptist Convention saying, ban them.
[02:11:15.116 --> 02:11:16.437]  Repeal the Second Amendment.
[02:11:16.437 --> 02:11:20.040]  I mean, Billy Graham's son... I didn't know they were back at it.
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:22.862]  Will you guys show me the article again?
[02:11:22.862 --> 02:11:24.803]  When did that come out?
[02:11:24.803 --> 02:11:26.205]  Yeah, just punch it back up on screen.
[02:11:26.205 --> 02:11:27.626]  I can just read it.
[02:11:27.626 --> 02:11:32.949]  It says, Dallas Police Relaunch Knock and Talk Initiative.
[02:11:32.949 --> 02:11:34.691]  And what is the date on that?
[02:11:36.477 --> 02:11:39.401]  That's 2010, so that's two and a half years ago.
[02:11:39.401 --> 02:11:43.007]  Yeah, the first time I saw that was about a decade ago.
[02:11:43.007 --> 02:11:50.537]  The Dallas Police Department has selected six officers from all of its seven divisions to do what the department calls, knocking ducks.
[02:11:51.667 --> 02:11:58.789]  And the police officers get permission to search people's homes without a warrant, but knock and talks have historically been a problem for the department.
[02:11:58.789 --> 02:12:05.751]  And it says in 2005, officers arrested three men in one of the largest drug busts in the city's history.
[02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:07.792]  Police seized two million in drugs, and it goes on.
[02:12:07.792 --> 02:12:10.072]  The Dallas police are famous for planting drugs on you.
[02:12:10.072 --> 02:12:11.613]  They've been caught doing that over and over again.
[02:12:11.613 --> 02:12:15.394]  They just pull over a nice car, throw a bag of chalk in the back, and then take it, and then take your house.
[02:12:15.714 --> 02:12:17.538]  And then this crime lab certifies it.
[02:12:17.538 --> 02:12:21.125]  But again, they want nice houses because that's got money.
[02:12:21.125 --> 02:12:21.666]  And houses.
[02:12:21.666 --> 02:12:24.151]  Sometimes the cops even move into the houses.
[02:12:24.151 --> 02:12:25.013]  I lived in Rockwall.
[02:12:26.207 --> 02:12:35.991]  And a couple FBI agents who were corrupt had moved in, in the neighborhood, to houses that they had seized in drug raids.
[02:12:35.991 --> 02:12:40.333]  And then I even had some of them come around and started messing with my parents.
[02:12:40.333 --> 02:12:43.654]  This is while we, I haven't told the whole story, while we moved out of Dallas.
[02:12:43.654 --> 02:12:46.035]  My dad sold the dental office he had and things.
[02:12:46.035 --> 02:12:49.597]  And he'd come by, he'd see me at the local community pool or something.
[02:12:50.357 --> 02:13:04.440]  Alex, you think you're real smart, young kid like you, good looking guy, you got a future and all the rest of it, and he'd sit there and lean with his trophy wife beside him at the pool and he'd go, you just better watch what happens to you, what you've been talking about.
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:10.461]  And I went, oh, you know about the local police and how I've been saying they're drug dealers, because I've seen them do it, and he goes, you just watch your butt, boy.
[02:13:10.461 --> 02:13:15.462]  And then our lawyer called us and said he got the call from the city, they're going to kill me.
[02:13:16.544 --> 02:13:18.228]  That's America.
[02:13:18.228 --> 02:13:20.133]  That's what America is, okay?
[02:13:20.133 --> 02:13:23.761]  And all of us are these naive sheeple.
[02:13:24.895 --> 02:13:26.496]  Don't use their illegal drugs.
[02:13:26.496 --> 02:13:27.676]  Ooh, they hate that.
[02:13:27.676 --> 02:13:29.837]  Don't you ever use their drugs, kids.
[02:13:29.837 --> 02:13:30.717]  They're not cool.
[02:13:30.717 --> 02:13:32.417]  And don't use their prescription drugs.
[02:13:32.417 --> 02:13:33.478]  And stay off it all.
[02:13:33.478 --> 02:13:34.318]  Beat them.
[02:13:34.318 --> 02:13:34.898]  Beat them.
[02:13:34.898 --> 02:13:36.059]  And don't drink and drive.
[02:13:36.059 --> 02:13:37.019]  In fact, I made the joke.
[02:13:37.019 --> 02:13:37.919]  Shut down all the bars.
[02:13:37.919 --> 02:13:39.620]  Oh no, they don't want that.
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:41.260]  That's the hunting over bait.
[02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:43.981]  Put the bars out, get you drunk, give everybody a criminal record.
[02:13:43.981 --> 02:13:45.542]  Just shut it all down.
[02:13:45.542 --> 02:13:46.582]  Shut all the bars down.
[02:13:46.582 --> 02:13:48.122]  Don't use any of their narcotics.
[02:13:48.122 --> 02:13:49.163]  None of it.
[02:13:49.163 --> 02:13:51.583]  I know you are, you filthy murderers.
[02:13:51.583 --> 02:13:52.804]  Go abort some more babies.
[02:13:53.649 --> 02:13:57.611]  Supposed to get angry... Excuse me, I'm just getting really angry now.
[02:13:57.611 --> 02:14:03.913]  Man, imagine cops coming up to your house and... We like to come in and inspect your firearms.
[02:14:03.913 --> 02:14:07.655]  Most people just go... Just fall to their knees.
[02:14:07.655 --> 02:14:09.636]  In fact, they came out in Boston.
[02:14:10.854 --> 02:14:11.875]  They'd refuse.
[02:14:11.875 --> 02:14:14.799]  If you say no, they force their way in without warrants.
[02:14:14.799 --> 02:14:20.606]  And they had state and federal judges say, Boston, last time I checked, can come in your house without a warrant.
[02:14:20.606 --> 02:14:22.448]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:14:22.448 --> 02:14:23.469]  And cops, don't worry.
[02:14:23.469 --> 02:14:27.194]  They're going to take your whole pension fund, and America's going to rot and fall apart.
[02:14:27.194 --> 02:14:29.236]  You're all on your power trip serving Satan.
[02:14:29.236 --> 02:14:29.537]  Good.
[02:14:29.537 --> 02:14:30.218]  You're going to love it.
[02:14:31.212 --> 02:14:38.895]  Or most of you are just naive and go watch movies like Olympus Has Fallen, where you actually believe North Korea is going to attack us.
[02:14:38.895 --> 02:14:44.097]  The New World Order already attacked and already took over, and now they're trying to mop everything else up.
[02:14:44.097 --> 02:14:45.657]  Okay, there's just one of the articles.
[02:14:45.657 --> 02:14:49.379]  Here's another one at InfoWars.com by the great Kurt Nemo.
[02:14:49.379 --> 02:14:55.601]  Biden, Senate, gun, bill vote, only the beginning.
[02:14:55.601 --> 02:14:58.042]  And there's his statements and press releases and video interviews.
[02:15:00.206 --> 02:15:06.070]  Uh, where he, uh, says, and they got other Congress people quoted there, that they're going to get the guns by increment.
[02:15:06.070 --> 02:15:06.851]  There will be more events.
[02:15:06.851 --> 02:15:07.391]  They will get the guns.
[02:15:07.391 --> 02:15:08.052]  I mean, that's it.
[02:15:08.052 --> 02:15:08.932]  There will be more events.
[02:15:08.932 --> 02:15:10.974]  Every time that happens, we're going to be blamed for it.
[02:15:10.974 --> 02:15:14.576]  But their Prozac heads do it, or they stage it, like, uh, Colorado's no doubt.
[02:15:14.576 --> 02:15:15.537]  100% they staged it.
[02:15:15.537 --> 02:15:16.077]  Boom.
[02:15:16.077 --> 02:15:16.938]  Out in the open.
[02:15:16.938 --> 02:15:17.638]  And they're just going to do it.
[02:15:17.638 --> 02:15:18.599]  I mean, they're terrorists, okay?
[02:15:18.599 --> 02:15:23.042]  And I'm here calling them terrorists, and you bet I'm pumped up and angry, because I don't like having to risk my life.
[02:15:23.042 --> 02:15:27.626]  But I'm not going to sit here and lay down to these people, okay?
[02:15:27.626 --> 02:15:29.187]  I'm so sick of their garbage.
[02:15:30.455 --> 02:15:34.738]  And all I want to say to all the feds and all of you on power trips, take extra shots.
[02:15:34.738 --> 02:15:36.620]  You believe in the system?
[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:37.921]  Give them to your kids.
[02:15:37.921 --> 02:15:46.487]  I don't want your kid to die, but maybe that'll, maybe if you murder your kid with a vaccine, maybe that'll wake you up and we can not murder much larger numbers of kids.
[02:15:46.487 --> 02:15:47.488]  Oh, I know though.
[02:15:47.488 --> 02:15:48.569]  I've had a lot of you on air.
[02:15:48.569 --> 02:15:52.091]  I had that State Attorney on from Maryland.
[02:15:52.091 --> 02:15:52.952]  They're in Baltimore.
[02:15:52.952 --> 02:15:54.093]  It was like five, six years ago.
[02:15:54.093 --> 02:15:55.634]  We've got to find that interview.
[02:15:55.634 --> 02:15:56.475]  I forget his name.
[02:15:56.475 --> 02:15:57.756]  He was a handsome black guy.
[02:15:58.416 --> 02:16:02.039]  And I said, you know, the law says that you don't have to take vaccines in Maryland.
[02:16:02.039 --> 02:16:12.089]  I read it to him and I said, but you've got 1,500 people plus their parents crying with police dogs and riot police saying it's the law to take shots or they'll all be arrested.
[02:16:12.089 --> 02:16:14.211]  Predominantly black area.
[02:16:14.211 --> 02:16:18.294]  And I said, you know, there's no law, but you kick them out for truancy and then arrest them for that.
[02:16:18.294 --> 02:16:21.798]  But you can't kick them out for truancy on something that's a policy and not the law.
[02:16:23.087 --> 02:16:28.050]  And by law, you've got to give them that state waiver to something that isn't even a law, to the policy.
[02:16:28.050 --> 02:16:32.993]  And he goes, well, we do have a judge in one room with those, but you didn't tell anybody, did you?
[02:16:32.993 --> 02:16:34.093]  And he goes, no.
[02:16:34.093 --> 02:16:35.794]  He goes, man, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:16:35.794 --> 02:16:36.915]  He goes, your dad started laughing.
[02:16:36.915 --> 02:16:39.276]  He goes, ha ha, man, you know all about this.
[02:16:39.276 --> 02:16:41.097]  And I went, do you give your kids shots?
[02:16:41.097 --> 02:16:43.078]  He went, no, started laughing.
[02:16:43.078 --> 02:16:46.440]  I went, you think it's cute that you don't give your kids shots.
[02:16:49.130 --> 02:16:55.155]  And you got these people lined up getting these deadly shots, and he's like, alright, I said I'd do the interview, but I gotta go.
[02:16:55.155 --> 02:16:56.956]  I gotta go.
[02:16:56.956 --> 02:16:59.858]  And I was like, whoa, and that is everything right there.
[02:16:59.858 --> 02:17:10.226]  If you want to know the whole enchilada, the whole big, giant, kookamonga-size operation, that's it.
[02:17:11.598 --> 02:17:12.018]  We've got to
[02:17:27.484 --> 02:17:31.525]  Outside, out around the courthouse at the park.
[02:17:31.525 --> 02:17:34.146]  Guarding because terrorists were saying they didn't have to.
[02:17:34.146 --> 02:17:35.506]  Keeping people back to warn them.
[02:17:35.506 --> 02:17:36.626]  There's no law!
[02:17:36.626 --> 02:17:38.106]  And the cops kept them back.
[02:17:38.106 --> 02:17:39.867]  The free speech zone's down around the back.
[02:17:39.867 --> 02:17:40.787]  I'll arrest you.
[02:17:40.787 --> 02:17:42.147]  You can't talk to citizens.
[02:17:42.147 --> 02:17:46.828]  Imagine they're all lined up getting shots with police dogs.
[02:17:46.828 --> 02:17:48.288]  All around them and it's on the news.
[02:17:48.288 --> 02:17:49.129]  It's the law.
[02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:49.849]  Take the shots.
[02:17:49.849 --> 02:17:50.309]  It's the law.
[02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:51.529]  It's a giant hoax.
[02:17:51.529 --> 02:17:52.589]  It was a production.
[02:17:52.589 --> 02:17:55.270]  And I get the head state attorney.
[02:17:56.072 --> 02:18:00.355]  For that was a county, he was assigned to that county that Baltimore's in.
[02:18:00.355 --> 02:18:09.301]  There it is, state attorney admits no law, makes vaccines mandatory, hundreds of parents face jail time after school kicked out children triggering unfair truancy charges.
[02:18:09.301 --> 02:18:10.963]  Paul Joseph Watts in 2007.
[02:18:10.963 --> 02:18:15.306]  So that's three, six years ago, okay, I was right.
[02:18:16.491 --> 02:18:23.858]  State prosecutor involved in bringing potential charges against hundreds of parents in a county just outside Washington D.C.
[02:18:23.858 --> 02:18:33.367]  for failing to allow their children to be vaccinated admitted yesterday on national radio show that there is a law that mandates any vaccine
[02:18:34.741 --> 02:18:37.822]  Despite a Fox News report falsely claiming otherwise.
[02:18:37.822 --> 02:18:46.524]  Yesterday we highlighted the case of Prince George County, that was it, Maryland, where parents of more than 1,600 children, Seth said 1,500.
[02:18:46.524 --> 02:18:48.845]  God gave me one hell of a memory, thank you God.
[02:18:48.845 --> 02:18:51.045]  Please just keep giving it to me.
[02:18:51.045 --> 02:18:56.847]  Children have been told they could be put in jail for failing to get their kids vaccinated.
[02:18:56.847 --> 02:18:59.167]  Now where's the guy's name?
[02:18:59.167 --> 02:19:01.608]  Unless parents bring their children to court on Saturday,
[02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:09.222]  Where medical offices will be stand-by to forcibly medical officials inject their children
[02:19:10.342 --> 02:19:10.902]  And it goes on.
[02:19:10.902 --> 02:19:12.463]  Go down, find the guy's name.
[02:19:12.463 --> 02:19:13.823]  I think the interview's there.
[02:19:13.823 --> 02:19:18.085]  The threat of arrest was a result of failure to get the kids immunized.
[02:19:18.085 --> 02:19:20.286]  The threat of arrest was not, okay, let me just stop.
[02:19:20.286 --> 02:19:21.986]  I'll try to read quick and then I'll babble through it.
[02:19:21.986 --> 02:19:23.507]  Just stop it right there, I'm gonna read it.
[02:19:23.507 --> 02:19:25.768]  I'm reading it off the screen, I'm like 15 feet away, I'm gonna read it.
[02:19:25.768 --> 02:19:35.491]  The threat of arrest was not a result of failure to get the kids immunized, but because of truancy laws, which were only triggered after the school expelled the children for not getting the shots.
[02:19:35.491 --> 02:19:39.133]  There is no law in the United States which makes vaccinations mandatory, so Paul breaks that down.
[02:19:39.733 --> 02:19:40.173]  Keep going.
[02:19:40.173 --> 02:19:41.635]  Let me find the guy.
[02:19:41.635 --> 02:19:42.275]  Keep scrolling down.
[02:19:42.275 --> 02:19:43.976]  Do we have his name there?
[02:19:43.976 --> 02:19:47.339]  The state attorney preparing to bring charges against the parents yesterday.
[02:19:47.339 --> 02:19:48.940]  There's his photo right there.
[02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:51.282]  Admitted on National Syndicated Radio.
[02:19:51.282 --> 02:19:52.443]  Attorney Glenn Ivey.
[02:19:52.443 --> 02:19:53.824]  That's it.
[02:19:53.824 --> 02:19:54.985]  State Attorney Glenn Ivey.
[02:19:54.985 --> 02:19:55.125]  Boom.
[02:19:55.125 --> 02:19:56.846]  We're going to get Glenn Ivey back on.
[02:19:56.846 --> 02:19:58.407]  He said, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:19:58.407 --> 02:20:01.069]  He thought I was cool that I knew it was all baloney.
[02:20:01.069 --> 02:20:01.430]  Man.
[02:20:01.430 --> 02:20:03.291]  Introducing Pro One.

[02:21:00.928 --> 02:21:03.309]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:21:03.309 --> 02:21:06.611]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:21:06.611 --> 02:21:12.754]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will shock you.
[02:21:12.754 --> 02:21:20.578]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:21:22.359 --> 02:21:24.981]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:21:24.981 --> 02:21:27.143]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:21:27.143 --> 02:21:34.630]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:39.114]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:21:39.614 --> 02:21:45.839]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:21:45.839 --> 02:21:47.181]  You'll be shocked.
[02:21:47.181 --> 02:21:52.405]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:21:52.405 --> 02:21:57.870]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:21:57.870 --> 02:22:00.492]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:22:00.492 --> 02:22:01.273]  Gold.
[02:22:01.273 --> 02:22:02.534]  It's like nothing else on earth.
[02:22:02.794 --> 02:22:09.079]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:22:09.079 --> 02:22:13.262]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:22:13.262 --> 02:22:15.203]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:22:15.203 --> 02:22:17.625]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:22:17.625 --> 02:22:25.230]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:22:25.230 --> 02:22:25.970]  We're good to go.
[02:22:53.575 --> 02:22:54.015]  We're good.
[02:23:17.188 --> 02:23:21.971]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:23:21.971 --> 02:23:26.114]  One World Whey is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:23:26.114 --> 02:23:34.240]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids and all whey protein powders we've investigated and most proteins you consume are heated.
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:38.142]  With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[02:23:38.142 --> 02:23:39.163]  My name is Daniel.
[02:23:39.163 --> 02:23:40.384]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:23:40.384 --> 02:23:43.266]  When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:23:43.266 --> 02:23:43.346]  Now,
[02:23:45.007 --> 02:23:48.048]  After two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:23:48.048 --> 02:23:49.349]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:54.330]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:23:54.330 --> 02:23:55.871]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:24:11.454 --> 02:24:14.735]  If you love liberty, I tell you I'm your man.
[02:24:14.735 --> 02:24:17.496]  You win some, you lose some.
[02:24:17.496 --> 02:24:22.058]  It's all the great game.
[02:24:22.058 --> 02:24:31.281]  7 or 11, Snake Eyes watching you.
[02:24:31.281 --> 02:24:31.841]  Alright, let me do this.
[02:24:31.841 --> 02:24:36.383]  Let me take some calls for a while, then I'm gonna reset and get into the big Monsanto news, the gun news.
[02:24:38.476 --> 02:24:40.017]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:40.017 --> 02:24:41.418]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:24:41.418 --> 02:24:45.220]  Let's talk to Scott in Houston, who wants to talk about the police state.
[02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:49.663]  I tell you what, there's a police state where only people have 300 euros a day out of their bank accounts.
[02:24:49.663 --> 02:24:55.086]  They've already taken up to 40% or more out of some people's accounts, and now they're going to just keep taking it out.
[02:24:55.086 --> 02:24:57.527]  Now they're saying Europe, why they may start taking the money.
[02:24:57.527 --> 02:25:06.873]  And then, of course, here, just directly to foreign private banks, after all the taxes you pay, they take your money, or everything will collapse, as they're collapsing everything.
[02:25:08.434 --> 02:25:11.297]  It's like we're all compulsive gamblers.
[02:25:11.297 --> 02:25:13.078]  We stay in the government system.
[02:25:13.078 --> 02:25:17.582]  We stay in it because we'll lose everything if we don't keep doubling down.
[02:25:17.582 --> 02:25:24.968]  But it's like gambling because the gambler keeps betting and betting and betting and getting into debt they can never pay back because they're gonna get it back.
[02:25:24.968 --> 02:25:27.470]  Well, they don't want to lose that money so they got to keep doubling down.
[02:25:30.307 --> 02:25:32.388]  It's Stockholm Syndrome, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:32.388 --> 02:25:34.149]  Don't go in the casino to begin with.
[02:25:34.149 --> 02:25:35.930]  Well, we're in the government casino now.
[02:25:35.930 --> 02:25:37.631]  They think they've got us dependent.
[02:25:37.631 --> 02:25:41.253]  No, you don't.
[02:25:41.253 --> 02:25:45.675]  Scott in Houston, go ahead and tell me about the police state, sir.
[02:25:45.675 --> 02:25:48.057]  Alex, I've got kind of some optimistic news.
[02:25:48.057 --> 02:25:52.499]  A lot of your listeners are going to probably think I'm, you know, full of it or whatever, but... No, I want to hear your good news.
[02:25:52.499 --> 02:25:53.200]  Tell me.
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:55.941]  Okay, well, I'm a Houston firefighter in Houston.
[02:25:55.941 --> 02:25:56.942]  I can't speak for the other
[02:25:58.157 --> 02:26:00.758]  Well, I want to be clear, and I don't want people to start over and have me interrupt you.
[02:26:00.758 --> 02:26:02.819]  I get into frothing anger.
[02:26:26.187 --> 02:26:38.756]  When I see Dallas police going in people's houses without warrants, trying to confiscate their guns, everyone I know who shoots guns in the middle of nowhere has the cops show up now, including our ranch in East Texas.
[02:26:38.756 --> 02:26:44.119]  It's unbelievable that we've, since before it was a county, we got it from from the Mexican government.
[02:26:44.119 --> 02:26:48.282]  Okay, I mean, this is the type of stuff we got to put up with now in this country.
[02:26:48.282 --> 02:26:51.544]  And so I get in a primitive level, start hopping up and down.
[02:26:51.544 --> 02:26:55.007]  When I hear and see all this, I get that two things are happening.
[02:26:55.990 --> 02:27:03.874]  The police state and the global takeover is waking up cops and military to where they're totally awake now and freaked out and speaking out.
[02:27:03.874 --> 02:27:07.155]  Or other departments are pure criminal now.
[02:27:07.155 --> 02:27:07.595]  Okay?
[02:27:07.595 --> 02:27:14.018]  And so the issue here is that there's a battle for the soul of the police and military going on.
[02:27:14.018 --> 02:27:15.299]  So I want to recognize that.
[02:27:15.919 --> 02:27:24.267]  Okay and I found cops are more awake on average than anybody except the military because they actually know that stuff's going in the wrong direction.
[02:27:24.267 --> 02:27:31.974]  The problem is cops that like it are obviously criminals or nutcases or control freaks and I'm telling you they're starting to take over.
[02:27:31.974 --> 02:27:34.096]  So go ahead.
[02:27:34.096 --> 02:27:37.499]  Well those cops are either bored or just tainted and of course
[02:27:38.311 --> 02:27:40.914]  You know, you're training, you can't train a good character.
[02:27:40.914 --> 02:27:44.018]  You can train somebody to be a police officer, a firefighter.
[02:27:44.018 --> 02:27:47.202]  But their character, if it's bad, it's bad.
[02:27:47.202 --> 02:27:49.264]  But... But what do you do when you're given an unlawful order?
[02:27:49.264 --> 02:27:54.631]  I mean, I get now that orders are so unlawful from the feds that people are saying, I'm not going to do this.
[02:27:54.631 --> 02:27:55.872]  That's a good discussion.
[02:27:55.872 --> 02:27:57.735]  That's what can save this country, is that discussion.
[02:27:58.567 --> 02:27:59.508]  And you don't do it.
[02:27:59.508 --> 02:28:00.869]  You don't perform it.
[02:28:00.869 --> 02:28:06.893]  In the fire department, there's been a number of times when we've gone against protocol to save a life.
[02:28:06.893 --> 02:28:13.838]  We've trans... You know, I can get in trouble for saying... Oh yeah, they're now saying you're not allowed to go in the water to save somebody, or you can't go in a burning building.
[02:28:13.838 --> 02:28:18.522]  If you make the decision to risk your life, when that's what everything's about, is your individual will.
[02:28:18.522 --> 02:28:25.427]  They're telling lifeguards they can't save people if they're one foot past the, you know, the county's line.
[02:28:26.806 --> 02:28:30.070]  When there's laws in common law that you have to render aid.
[02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:33.094]  There's a greater law than these garbage laws.
[02:28:33.094 --> 02:28:35.337]  I follow the common law that's God's law.
[02:28:35.337 --> 02:28:37.179]  That's what you're saying.
[02:28:37.179 --> 02:28:43.668]  Yes, and I'm letting you know that there are people in Houston with badges that have sold.
[02:28:44.392 --> 02:28:49.459]  And they know damn well what the government's doing on a federal level.
[02:28:49.459 --> 02:28:52.482]  They know what they want to do and they're not going to stand for it.
[02:28:52.482 --> 02:28:54.004]  We're not going to stand for it.
[02:28:54.004 --> 02:29:00.433]  And they can send money to us to paint the police cars black and white.
[02:29:00.433 --> 02:29:01.514]  Your cell phone's breaking up.
[02:29:01.514 --> 02:29:01.915]  Say it again.
[02:29:02.950 --> 02:29:12.595]  They can spend money to have all the police cars painted black and white, to have all the fire apparatus painted red, so that they can have their unified, federal look.
[02:29:12.595 --> 02:29:14.556]  You know, that's their little foot in the door.
[02:29:14.556 --> 02:29:24.560]  They can come to Houston and they can have their training exercises without even the common decency of letting us emergency services know what's going on.
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:28.262]  No, no, they're standardizing the codes so they can command you.
[02:29:28.262 --> 02:29:28.642]  Stay there.
[02:29:28.642 --> 02:29:29.563]  You want to come back and finish up?
[02:29:30.558 --> 02:29:31.818]  I'm going to come back to Scott.
[02:29:31.818 --> 02:29:33.179]  Good caller.
[02:29:33.179 --> 02:29:36.239]  I love hearing that resolve in the voice.
[02:29:36.239 --> 02:29:40.541]  They're trying to federalize the fire departments with the training and make them into spies.
[02:29:40.541 --> 02:29:43.161]  You don't need to be told to be a spy.
[02:29:43.161 --> 02:29:48.943]  If you're in a house as a firefighter and you see criminal stuff, you don't need to be told to be a spy, folks.
[02:29:48.943 --> 02:29:50.583]  I'm going to explain that when we come back.
[02:29:50.583 --> 02:29:51.964]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.964 --> 02:29:54.504]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.504 --> 02:29:57.185]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:33:03.325 --> 02:33:06.907]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:06.907 --> 02:33:11.770]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:11.770 --> 02:33:13.632]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:13.632 --> 02:33:14.092]  to 2 p.m.
[02:33:14.092 --> 02:33:14.872]  We're here.
[02:33:14.872 --> 02:33:16.673]  And yes, I am a maniac.
[02:33:32.895 --> 02:33:33.915]  We're meant to be maniacs.
[02:33:33.915 --> 02:33:42.138]  We're meant to be aggressive, on target, fiercely independent, focused, building things, working with good people that prove themselves to be honorable.
[02:33:42.138 --> 02:33:44.498]  That's how you build a civilization.
[02:33:44.498 --> 02:33:49.040]  And I just do not want a bunch of cheats and scam artists and flimflam artists.
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:50.080]  And none of us are perfect.
[02:33:51.185 --> 02:33:53.946]  But I mean, you've got conscious bad people running things.
[02:33:53.946 --> 02:33:55.246]  I don't want them in charge.
[02:33:55.246 --> 02:34:02.068]  And they're setting Homeland Security up for a Civil War scenario, and that's not being openly discussed in the news, against gun owners.
[02:34:02.068 --> 02:34:03.868]  I mean, it's official.
[02:34:03.868 --> 02:34:04.868]  You heard it here first.
[02:34:04.868 --> 02:34:05.569]  Not bragging.
[02:34:05.569 --> 02:34:07.689]  I'm telling you, this stuff sounds crazy.
[02:34:07.689 --> 02:34:08.969]  History's crazy.
[02:34:08.969 --> 02:34:11.210]  And you heard it here first.
[02:34:11.210 --> 02:34:17.131]  You heard me over and over again tell you they're going to flip Homeland Security on the gun owners, libertarians, veterans, conservatives.
[02:34:17.131 --> 02:34:19.592]  And people are like, how did you know that before it even got declassified?
[02:34:20.765 --> 02:34:22.669]  Because I've been to the urban warfare drills.
[02:34:22.669 --> 02:34:25.353]  See, the thing about intelligence, why do they send spies out in war?
[02:34:25.353 --> 02:34:27.718]  I'm going to go to the firefighter here in just a second.
[02:34:27.718 --> 02:34:30.102]  Scott in Houston in just a moment, and then to others and more news.
[02:34:31.252 --> 02:34:32.953]  I studied military history.
[02:34:32.953 --> 02:34:39.015]  I fell into it when I was like eight years old, because anything I asked for, I wouldn't get.
[02:34:39.015 --> 02:34:47.079]  Unless it was a chemistry set, or unless it was a BB gun, you know, things that my dad thought I needed, I would get.
[02:34:47.079 --> 02:34:49.780]  Any other toys, stuff I asked for, I didn't usually get it.
[02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:59.464]  And I could sit there and watch PBS type shows, I could sit there and watch news shows, and they would have the ads on, whether it was a Discovery Channel or History Channel,
[02:35:00.962 --> 02:35:08.848]  For, you know, the World War II Encyclopedia, the World War I Encyclopedia, the Old West Encyclopedia.
[02:35:08.848 --> 02:35:13.031]  And those things, I would read them cover to cover by the time I was about ten.
[02:35:13.031 --> 02:35:14.652]  And could read pretty good.
[02:35:14.652 --> 02:35:18.775]  And, you know, at like eight or nine I was asking for them and getting them and looking at the pictures.
[02:35:18.775 --> 02:35:20.476]  But that's how I got to where I could read half decent.
[02:35:20.476 --> 02:35:23.959]  Because I wasn't really a quick learner when I was younger until I started reading those.
[02:35:23.959 --> 02:35:24.920]  Then I got into reading and then
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:28.322]  You know, obviously, it just opened up the whole universe.
[02:35:28.322 --> 02:35:34.686]  And there's so much even in mainline history books, even though you think history is distorted, that's kind of for the general public on the news.
[02:35:34.686 --> 02:35:38.069]  When you read big, thick history books and stuff, it's just raw data.
[02:35:38.069 --> 02:35:40.771]  And then by the time I was about 12, I started reading like 800 page, 1,000 page.
[02:35:42.992 --> 02:36:02.564]  You know, Order of the Deathshead by Heinz Hobel, Reisenthal, the Third Reich, Scherer, The Mind of Adolf Hitler, Secret Wartime Report that they published, The Mind of Stalin, Wartime Report, The Mind of... And so I just, by the time I was like 16, I'd be in bookstores.
[02:36:04.454 --> 02:36:09.695]  You know, just like buying Mein Kampf and just wanting to read the actual stuff these people wrote.
[02:36:09.695 --> 02:36:14.916]  I remember being at the checkout counter, they had Hitler on the cover, and they're like, well, you're selling the book.
[02:36:14.916 --> 02:36:17.537]  You think I'm like Hitler because I'm reading this?
[02:36:17.537 --> 02:36:18.757]  It just shows people's ignorance.
[02:36:18.757 --> 02:36:21.277]  I guess I did have blonde hair and blue eyes then, especially.
[02:36:21.277 --> 02:36:25.058]  But the point is, is that it's almost weird to want to know history.
[02:36:25.058 --> 02:36:29.699]  It's like an idiocracy where they're going, we got one that can read.
[02:36:29.699 --> 02:36:33.220]  And because I'd studied all that, I know military operations.
[02:36:34.161 --> 02:36:40.283]  I mean, they call generals brainiacs who are actually into reading military history and, you know, call them the professor and stuff.
[02:36:40.283 --> 02:36:42.704]  There's not even many of those that actually are into it.
[02:36:42.704 --> 02:36:47.586]  They want to play golf, date secretaries, act tough, act like generals.
[02:36:47.586 --> 02:36:49.927]  Real generals are poring over things to know the enemy.
[02:36:49.927 --> 02:36:54.068]  Real generals are locked up reading manuscripts on warfare.
[02:36:54.068 --> 02:37:00.531]  But the reason I went off into that whole area is that I learned that you see enemy operations
[02:37:01.551 --> 02:37:04.672]  By what their actual troop movements are and what they're doing.
[02:37:04.672 --> 02:37:11.494]  You can see why they're announcing something or what the propaganda cover is, but when you get the real material, you get the real goal.
[02:37:11.494 --> 02:37:14.415]  Now, if they're facing an enemy, they'll put out decoys and stuff.
[02:37:14.415 --> 02:37:16.196]  If they're facing an enemy that even pays attention.
[02:37:17.284 --> 02:37:23.706]  The globalists have operated for 50 years as if we don't exist because the public was mesmerized by TV and culture.
[02:37:23.706 --> 02:37:26.027]  So their entire battle plan is pretty much public.
[02:37:26.027 --> 02:37:29.228]  It's a little watered down not to scare their own internal people.
[02:37:29.228 --> 02:37:32.669]  Like, we're only going to kill 80% once we get world government.
[02:37:32.669 --> 02:37:33.889]  They're like, oh, well, I'll be safe.
[02:37:33.889 --> 02:37:35.030]  Yes, you will.
[02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:41.672]  The more internal, higher up stuff that we found and republished, you know, they're going to kill everybody.
[02:37:41.672 --> 02:37:44.393]  And I mean, that's basically, for all intents and purposes, everybody.
[02:37:45.223 --> 02:37:46.964]  Zardoz level.
[02:37:46.964 --> 02:37:52.308]  You see all that Moonraker written by an MI6 OSS guy before that, Ian Fleming.
[02:37:52.308 --> 02:37:56.591]  The reason you see all that in Hollywood and culture is because that's the real plan.
[02:37:56.591 --> 02:37:58.512]  And they're just telling you and getting you ready.
[02:37:58.512 --> 02:38:02.695]  And the 20% or so that think they're in the technocracy are kind of in on it.
[02:38:02.695 --> 02:38:04.256]  And yeah, there are too many of us.
[02:38:04.256 --> 02:38:06.418]  If you confront them with it, they'll admit it.
[02:38:06.418 --> 02:38:09.820]  They haven't been brought into the real conspiracy, but it's an open conspiracy.
[02:38:11.468 --> 02:38:18.336]  And so that's what I'm telling you, is that all their operations are out in the open for me.
[02:38:18.336 --> 02:38:20.298]  Because it is out in the open.
[02:38:20.298 --> 02:38:24.323]  They're not running silent, because they think you're deaf, dumb, and blind.
[02:38:24.323 --> 02:38:25.524]  Politically.
[02:38:25.524 --> 02:38:27.867]  They are running wide open, uncloaked, okay?
[02:38:27.867 --> 02:38:30.289]  I mean, what I'm telling you is what they've said.
[02:38:31.167 --> 02:38:34.571]  I'm not a prophet like so many people, oh this guy, how does he know all this?
[02:38:34.571 --> 02:38:36.733]  Folks, it's all written by them.
[02:38:36.733 --> 02:38:38.314]  They brag about it.
[02:38:38.314 --> 02:38:43.620]  There are thousands of declassified chemtrailing programs, but they're not under the name chemtrail.
[02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:44.581]  It's all going on.
[02:38:44.581 --> 02:38:45.622]  Do you have the Al Gore clip?
[02:38:49.401 --> 02:38:52.162]  Okay, cue it back up for me, and when we finish up with this call, we'll go to it.
[02:38:52.162 --> 02:38:56.944]  Sorry, Scott, I went off on a rant, and I wasn't bragging how I know this stuff.
[02:38:56.944 --> 02:39:01.066]  I'm telling people it's all there, and it's not boring.
[02:39:01.066 --> 02:39:02.547]  It's real.
[02:39:02.547 --> 02:39:03.247]  Oh, Al Gore's ready.
[02:39:03.247 --> 02:39:04.207]  We'll go back to Scott in a moment.
[02:39:04.207 --> 02:39:09.449]  Here's Al Gore admitting that, you know, well, there's those that want to do it, and it's a terrible idea.
[02:39:09.449 --> 02:39:11.410]  The program's already ongoing.
[02:39:11.410 --> 02:39:12.851]  But here they are on geoengineering.
[02:39:14.118 --> 02:39:24.185]  There's a rumor, I don't know if this is true or not, that some scientists are trying to figure out a way to block the sun to try to slow down global warming.
[02:39:24.185 --> 02:39:28.507]  Yeah, it's a measure of the feeling of desperation that some of them feel.
[02:39:28.507 --> 02:39:29.828]  Are they really thinking they could do that?
[02:39:29.828 --> 02:39:35.892]  Well, some of them are seriously proposing, and I think it's completely nuts.
[02:39:35.892 --> 02:39:40.315]  You know, you put another kind of pollution, sulfur dioxide, up to orbit
[02:39:40.855 --> 02:39:46.781]  The cover of the atmosphere, the sky won't be really blue in the way it is now anymore.
[02:39:46.781 --> 02:39:47.501]  It's not blue anymore.
[02:39:47.501 --> 02:39:57.070]  But it would block out some of the sun's heat so that we wouldn't have to take the difficult steps to stop spewing all this global warming pollution into the atmosphere.
[02:39:57.070 --> 02:39:58.571]  Because your investments are in China.
[02:39:59.312 --> 02:40:00.313]  You want to shut us down?
[02:40:23.834 --> 02:40:25.016]  And they add it to the jet fuel.
[02:40:25.016 --> 02:40:26.017]  The companies don't even know.
[02:40:26.017 --> 02:40:27.779]  It's part of national security.
[02:40:27.779 --> 02:40:29.141]  People say, well look at the spray planes.
[02:40:29.141 --> 02:40:30.683]  It is the planes.
[02:40:30.683 --> 02:40:33.126]  It's added and then projected out of the jet engines.
[02:40:34.204 --> 02:40:35.205]  Okay?
[02:40:35.205 --> 02:40:41.368]  That's why before 20 years ago or so, chemtrails never stayed up there more than a few minutes, they stay up hours now.
[02:40:41.368 --> 02:40:43.229]  Because they're not ice crystals.
[02:40:43.229 --> 02:40:51.774]  They are nuclei of sulfur dioxide and barium salts and other things forming water droplets that are larger to be reflective.
[02:40:51.774 --> 02:40:54.235]  And there's a bunch of other programs as well.
[02:40:54.235 --> 02:40:58.998]  But notice Ellen DeGeneres has to say, I heard this, is it a rumor?
[02:41:00.219 --> 02:41:01.720]  See, because no one actually goes and does research.
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:03.622]  He's like, I heard there's two billion bullets.
[02:41:03.622 --> 02:41:05.003]  No, there's not, my dearie.
[02:41:05.003 --> 02:41:08.406]  Even though it's all admitted if you just did the research.
[02:41:08.406 --> 02:41:11.308]  But people don't know how.
[02:41:11.308 --> 02:41:13.550]  Or they've never imagined it.
[02:41:13.550 --> 02:41:20.255]  Because again, we were just here 20 years ago, the old-timers, when I first got on air, people were like, planes are spraying, and I'm like, shut up, kook.
[02:41:21.107 --> 02:41:24.208]  And then I found out it was true, but all we knew the name was was Chemtrail.
[02:41:24.208 --> 02:41:32.830]  Then somebody called in about 10 years ago and goes, have you search engined high-altitude aerosol programming or weather modification?
[02:41:32.830 --> 02:41:43.553]  And I'm like, and I typed it, it was like 50,000 results, Department of Energy, the spray planes, how they do it, the grid patterns, top scientists admitting it, just, I mean, just like thousands of volumes.
[02:41:43.553 --> 02:41:47.634]  You could never even, I mean, just all out in the open 100%.
[02:41:47.634 --> 02:41:49.114]  Do you know how frustrating that is?
[02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:56.465]  You know how frustrating, and then the public, callers, are chemtrails real?
[02:41:56.465 --> 02:41:59.728]  You know, the word chemtrail isn't real because the public doesn't know it's real.
[02:41:59.728 --> 02:42:10.759]  That the aerosol terraforming, geoengineering, high altitude aerosol program, passive auroral programs, HAARP programs, I have the HAARP director on.
[02:42:10.759 --> 02:42:14.763]  And there was an Air Force colonel on, that interview's online.
[02:42:15.751 --> 02:42:20.093]  Harp calls and goes, the director likes your show and wants to explain to you it's not a problem.
[02:42:20.093 --> 02:42:22.094]  We never do this, but he wants to come on.
[02:42:22.094 --> 02:42:26.937]  So we call, we check, it's the real director of Harp, the civilian director.
[02:42:26.937 --> 02:42:32.840]  There's an Air Force colonel calls me for the show and he goes, you know, I'm going to the firefighter here in a moment.
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:33.240]  And he says,
[02:42:34.884 --> 02:42:36.085]  All right, we don't really do this.
[02:42:36.085 --> 02:42:39.709]  I'm going to be on the line the whole time if you bring up anything that's national security.
[02:42:39.709 --> 02:42:41.110]  He goes, you're not recording this, are you?
[02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.650]  Well, we're checking.
[02:42:41.650 --> 02:42:41.951]  We're not.
[02:42:41.951 --> 02:42:43.512]  You better not.
[02:42:43.512 --> 02:42:45.854]  And I said the colonel's name on air and stuff after that.
[02:42:45.854 --> 02:42:49.978]  I said, look, man, you guys contacted us.
[02:42:49.978 --> 02:42:50.539]  So I get him.
[02:42:50.539 --> 02:42:51.340]  I was supposed to go an hour.
[02:42:51.340 --> 02:42:52.260]  I think it went like 30 minutes.
[02:42:53.672 --> 02:42:58.695]  One time it cuts off, the colonel cuts him off, calls back and says, don't go into that area, this is on air, this happened.
[02:42:58.695 --> 02:43:01.077]  Then during a break he goes, stop going into that area, it's over.
[02:43:01.077 --> 02:43:08.181]  Well finally the interview ends, 30 minutes early, because the mad scientist is like, I like setting the atmosphere on fire.
[02:43:08.181 --> 02:43:14.365]  We can project it and some nights light it on, you know, cause explosions, and the colonel just cut it off right there.
[02:43:19.542 --> 02:43:22.124]  And people ask me, is there a HAARP program?
[02:43:22.124 --> 02:43:23.406]  It's on record, it admits.
[02:43:23.406 --> 02:43:25.988]  The Eastman Patents, all of it.
[02:43:25.988 --> 02:43:27.029]  Let me just go to the call.
[02:43:27.029 --> 02:43:28.370]  Scott, I'm sorry, you've got the floor.
[02:43:28.370 --> 02:43:33.455]  Make your point about people waking up and where this is going and what the police officers you know are saying.
[02:43:33.455 --> 02:43:38.119]  What percentage would you say really understand we're in deep trouble?
[02:43:38.119 --> 02:43:42.343]  Oh, I'd say in Houston, I'd say 80 to 90 percent.
[02:43:44.042 --> 02:43:48.950]  You're, you're, just explain, let me explain something on the surface and then I'll explain something on the surface.
[02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:51.494]  You're explaining how the feds are down there federalizing.
[02:43:51.494 --> 02:43:53.617]  That's only waking people up.
[02:43:53.617 --> 02:43:55.340]  Oh, that's only pissing us off.
[02:43:56.127 --> 02:43:58.929]  Because they're not telling anybody about it.
[02:43:58.929 --> 02:44:01.411]  They're not telling the emergency services about it.
[02:44:01.411 --> 02:44:09.797]  Do you know how freaked out we were in the fire station when we hear over the air that we're having mass shootings at a school with helicopters flying over?
[02:44:09.797 --> 02:44:18.684]  And you got heavy fire apparatus hauling butt over there to see what's going on, just so that they can say, oh, this is just an operation.
[02:44:18.684 --> 02:44:22.627]  And that the next day, they had the audacity to insult us.
[02:44:23.407 --> 02:44:24.668]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:44:24.668 --> 02:44:30.830]  When they crashed in Houston 15 years ago and some Delta Force people reportedly almost died, they said it didn't exist on the news and the police imagined it.
[02:44:40.350 --> 02:44:41.051]  Yeah.
[02:44:41.051 --> 02:44:42.312]  Well, now the news is fine.
[02:44:42.312 --> 02:44:48.776]  I guess things are changing like Billy said, you know, last week when you had him on, things are changing a little more in the media.
[02:44:48.776 --> 02:44:53.960]  Local media is starting to kind of put things out there.
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:45:01.986]  People better get religion real fast, because I'm telling you, they're going to launch a giant false flag and a bunch of mass shootings and blame it on us.
[02:45:01.986 --> 02:45:03.887]  And they're going to start a civil war.
[02:45:03.887 --> 02:45:07.010]  And so people better really get ready for that propaganda.
[02:45:07.010 --> 02:45:08.130]  And because people are going to know
[02:45:08.931 --> 02:45:12.233]  The globalists did it, but a lot of people are going to be too scared to say it.
[02:45:12.233 --> 02:45:19.079]  And if we don't say it when that time happens... And by the way, if they kill me right after something like that happens, folks, you know it's on.
[02:45:19.079 --> 02:45:21.801]  They're not going to kill you.
[02:45:21.801 --> 02:45:24.042]  They can't kill you.
[02:45:24.042 --> 02:45:31.988]  They can't do anything to you because it would cause such a humongous uprising that they don't want.
[02:45:31.988 --> 02:45:37.152]  And people need to realize, and the feds need to realize, the police are not on their side.
[02:45:37.734 --> 02:45:39.675]  The police are on the side of the citizens.
[02:45:39.675 --> 02:45:41.455]  And I know a lot of people don't like cops.
[02:45:41.455 --> 02:45:42.896]  They write tickets.
[02:45:42.896 --> 02:45:45.437]  The young cops get carried away with their job.
[02:45:45.437 --> 02:45:49.078]  They kind of go a little bit against people's will.
[02:45:49.078 --> 02:45:51.859]  Sure, they've tried to turn you against the people, but it hadn't completely worked.
[02:45:51.859 --> 02:45:53.340]  I completely concur.
[02:45:53.340 --> 02:45:55.401]  And understand this, in the boss hog areas...
[02:45:56.232 --> 02:45:58.053]  Where there are bad police?
[02:45:58.053 --> 02:46:00.693]  When the stuff hits the fan, they're all just going to go home.
[02:46:00.693 --> 02:46:06.115]  The real news is, it's going to be the good cops and the good military that are going to stand up when this goes on.
[02:46:06.115 --> 02:46:08.716]  Because evil people, they don't fight for anything.
[02:46:08.716 --> 02:46:10.296]  They only do what's easy.
[02:46:10.296 --> 02:46:12.177]  See, remember, we've got the fighters.
[02:46:12.177 --> 02:46:15.298]  We've got the men and women in this country that actually care.
[02:46:15.298 --> 02:46:18.219]  And let me tell you, one good man is worth a hundred scumbags.
[02:46:18.219 --> 02:46:18.739]  I'm telling you.
[02:46:19.545 --> 02:46:22.186]  Oh yeah, that's our military.
[02:46:22.186 --> 02:46:25.266]  Our police on the local level is going to be our military.
[02:46:25.266 --> 02:46:33.448]  Our police and our citizens who own guns and know how to use them, that's our line of defense.
[02:46:33.448 --> 02:46:38.150]  Did the locals know what was going on when they federalized all the codes?
[02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:40.970]  No.
[02:46:40.970 --> 02:46:42.271]  No.
[02:46:42.271 --> 02:46:47.432]  I'm talking about firing police codes, you know, going into that federal call system and getting rid of your local calls.
[02:46:49.839 --> 02:46:53.742]  I don't even, to be honest, I don't even know what you're talking about there.
[02:46:53.742 --> 02:46:55.283]  Well, that's mainly with the police.
[02:46:55.283 --> 02:47:02.489]  They have emergency codes and they're federalizing those and going to scrambled systems so you can't hear it.
[02:47:02.489 --> 02:47:07.493]  Well, that's a part of the whole digital operation that they're going through.
[02:47:07.493 --> 02:47:09.795]  Yes, yes, that's the real takeover.
[02:47:09.795 --> 02:47:12.818]  And a lot of that is to keep the media out of it.
[02:47:13.536 --> 02:47:15.518]  Well, that has its ups and downs.
[02:47:15.518 --> 02:47:20.963]  You want the media to be able to know, but on the other hand, media can really screw up a situation.
[02:47:20.963 --> 02:47:25.828]  No, I know that, but I'm telling you, look, there's all, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:47:25.828 --> 02:47:26.969]  Oh, I agree, I agree.
[02:47:26.969 --> 02:47:32.754]  And the issue is, obviously, yeah, but they had ways with codes and things to keep the media from knowing what was going on before.
[02:47:32.754 --> 02:47:37.379]  Let me tell you, having the globalists control the communications codes is half the takeover.
[02:47:39.850 --> 02:47:43.595]  Yeah, there's a lot other ways of codes and they can use them than digital.
[02:47:43.595 --> 02:47:57.431]  I mean back back in the day during the civil rights movement when there was a riot going on they called it a brush fire over the radio and that was the firefighters knew we had a riot and the media didn't know there was a riot so I agree with you there's other ways
[02:47:57.751 --> 02:48:04.676]  No, I'm just saying that if you think there's a science to controlling the public, there's a greater science to controlling you.
[02:48:04.676 --> 02:48:08.759]  The people in government service are in the biggest brainwashing chambers there are.
[02:48:08.759 --> 02:48:18.847]  Because they may let Obama build up the domestic police state, then he leaves office, a right-winger comes in, people want to think they're a good guy, then they blow something up and start the Civil War.
[02:48:18.847 --> 02:48:20.828]  Let me tell you, they know what they're doing.
[02:48:20.828 --> 02:48:22.690]  I'm just saying, folks, this is serious.
[02:48:22.690 --> 02:48:24.751]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[02:48:24.751 --> 02:48:26.593]  Let me cover this Monsanto situation.
[02:48:27.878 --> 02:48:34.602]  Here's from Salon, how the Monsanto Protection Act snuck into law.
[02:48:34.602 --> 02:48:37.984]  Give folks a document cam shot of that for TV viewers.
[02:48:37.984 --> 02:48:43.488]  And a provision that protects the biotech giant from litigation passed Congress without many members knowing about it.
[02:48:43.488 --> 02:48:49.252]  Just like the vaccine manufacturers are given liability protection and they lie to the public, say it's the law to take shots.
[02:48:49.252 --> 02:48:55.276]  Then they lie to you and say there are no side effects when the insert says it can kill you, give you cancer, diabetes, everything else.
[02:48:55.276 --> 02:48:56.897]  This is showing how criminal they are.
[02:48:57.702 --> 02:49:06.171]  Okay, and so Obama has signed this, and of course he was saying he wouldn't sign it, just like the NDAA, so opposition wouldn't form.
[02:49:06.171 --> 02:49:07.532]  All that won't get signed.
[02:49:07.532 --> 02:49:12.457]  Monsanto wrote this, and now, what are they talking about?
[02:49:12.457 --> 02:49:13.999]  The food is going to be the vaccine.
[02:49:13.999 --> 02:49:15.500]  It's going to have the virus in it.
[02:49:15.500 --> 02:49:16.621]  That's what Bill Gates is pushing.
[02:49:17.631 --> 02:49:20.072]  And so, because this is medical food.
[02:49:20.072 --> 02:49:21.953]  This is weaponized food.
[02:49:21.953 --> 02:49:30.456]  They're now going to come out with not eight major food crops, all being GMO, that grow pesticides in them strong enough to kill bugs that eat them, but they say it's safe for you.
[02:49:30.456 --> 02:49:32.637]  That's what BT corn is.
[02:49:32.637 --> 02:49:34.317]  It's just so crazy, man.
[02:49:34.317 --> 02:49:36.078]  Organ failure is just spiking.
[02:49:36.078 --> 02:49:40.219]  And all the rodents they give this stuff to and test, it kills them.
[02:49:40.219 --> 02:49:42.500]  Again, I'm on air explaining to you what's going on.
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:44.401]  I mean, you need to know why you're going to die.
[02:49:45.566 --> 02:49:45.986]  Okay.
[02:49:45.986 --> 02:49:53.131]  I mean, you need to know, but it'll take 20 years, you know, but now with kids that are fast growing cells, it's going to hurt them even worse.
[02:49:53.131 --> 02:49:56.333]  That's why the poor little kids, man, you go in restaurants, you walk down the street.
[02:49:56.333 --> 02:50:00.196]  I mean, kids look like they've been run over by 18 wheelers.
[02:50:00.196 --> 02:50:07.681]  And so they just think you'll never be able to realize why everybody's dying and getting sick.
[02:50:07.681 --> 02:50:15.166]  You know, with, with the different BT corns that Monsanto and others have put out, they have to plant sanctuary crops of corn under federal law.
[02:50:18.183 --> 02:50:22.724]  It's just because it'll kill all the honey bees if they go eat off this stuff.
[02:50:22.724 --> 02:50:25.465]  They go collect the pollen and bring it back and turn it into honey.
[02:50:25.465 --> 02:50:27.565]  They partially digest it and vomit it back up.
[02:50:27.565 --> 02:50:28.666]  That's what honey is.
[02:50:28.666 --> 02:50:36.027]  Poor little buggers die.
[02:50:36.027 --> 02:50:38.348]  Can I have a sanctuary corn belt?
[02:50:38.348 --> 02:50:39.788]  Can I have what the honey bees are eating?
[02:50:39.788 --> 02:50:41.249]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:50:41.249 --> 02:50:42.149]  I don't get that, do I?
[02:50:44.966 --> 02:50:52.376]  And every food crop is now going to be GMO, and now their genetics are spreading into all the normal varieties, and soon you won't have a way out.
[02:50:52.376 --> 02:50:56.602]  And the elites, of course, have their private greenhouse facilities for their food supply.
[02:50:56.602 --> 02:50:57.443]  That's come out in the news.
[02:50:57.443 --> 02:50:58.604]  The Communist Chinese do as well.
[02:51:01.983 --> 02:51:05.767]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[02:51:05.767 --> 02:51:09.031]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[02:51:09.031 --> 02:51:11.834]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[02:51:11.834 --> 02:51:13.957]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[02:51:13.957 --> 02:51:16.800]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[02:52:01.624 --> 02:52:10.189]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:52:10.189 --> 02:52:13.871]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[02:52:13.871 --> 02:52:18.314]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[02:52:18.314 --> 02:52:23.017]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[02:52:23.357 --> 02:52:33.486]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, molds and fungus and is remarkable for wound care.
[02:52:33.486 --> 02:52:38.651]  Taken internally or used topically, it can help keep you safe from deadly pathogens.

[02:53:01.428 --> 02:53:03.830]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:07.373]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[02:53:07.373 --> 02:53:11.336]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[02:53:11.336 --> 02:53:17.240]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:20.142]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[02:53:20.142 --> 02:53:27.108]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[02:53:27.688 --> 02:53:33.552]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[02:53:33.552 --> 02:53:39.676]  EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[02:53:39.676 --> 02:53:45.140]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[02:53:45.700 --> 02:53:47.302]  Visit EasyArmor.net.
[02:53:47.302 --> 02:53:50.485]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net.
[02:53:50.485 --> 02:53:52.647]  Or call 888-58-ARMOR.
[02:53:52.647 --> 02:53:54.549]  That's 888-582-7667.
[02:53:54.549 --> 02:53:57.031]  EasyArmor.net.
[02:53:57.031 --> 02:54:01.836]  Ultimate door security made easy.
[02:54:01.836 --> 02:54:04.619]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:54:04.619 --> 02:54:07.422]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:10.583 --> 02:54:12.545]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:54:12.545 --> 02:54:15.448]  By the way, David Knight's got in-depth reports tonight.
[02:54:15.448 --> 02:54:17.129]  He's going to be hosting InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:54:17.129 --> 02:54:21.233]  I think we're airing a special report on the 2nd of November that I've been working on for three or four days with Darren McBrain.
[02:54:21.233 --> 02:54:22.794]  I believe that's tonight on the Nightly News.
[02:54:22.794 --> 02:54:31.622]  If not, it'll be tomorrow on the radio slash TV show, the InfoWars Live, the Alex Jones Show, as it's known in syndication, the show you're listening to right now, the radio show slash TV.
[02:54:32.723 --> 02:54:41.393]  But they passed this like the Federal Reserve Act was passed without following the Constitution or the Senate and House rules.
[02:54:42.459 --> 02:54:46.201]  Uh, they rammed it through with bipartisan evil.
[02:54:46.201 --> 02:54:54.005]  And again, back in the 60s and 70s, they got these vaccine liability protection passed so they could kill everybody.
[02:54:54.005 --> 02:55:04.051]  You know, sometimes the kid dies right there and the cops aren't evil and they find out it's the vaccine and don't throw the parents in jail and then you've got to have immunity.
[02:55:04.051 --> 02:55:05.232]  So they've got a license to kill.
[02:55:06.232 --> 02:55:09.154]  And these are called pharmacological crops.
[02:55:09.154 --> 02:55:13.396]  They've got the eight major food crops are like 89% GMO now.
[02:55:13.396 --> 02:55:15.957]  Some are 86, some are 92.
[02:55:15.957 --> 02:55:17.958]  On average, about 89% GMO.
[02:55:17.958 --> 02:55:20.080]  It'll soon be pretty much all GMO.
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:24.002]  That's why Whole Foods is saying, we're going to be GMO now, but we'll label it.
[02:55:24.002 --> 02:55:24.962]  And you just won't have a choice.
[02:55:24.962 --> 02:55:26.303]  90-something percent will be that.
[02:55:26.303 --> 02:55:27.484]  There'll be a small area.
[02:55:27.484 --> 02:55:29.024]  It'll cost 10 times more.
[02:55:29.024 --> 02:55:32.846]  And then they're going to harass and hunt down and shut down all the organic people.
[02:55:32.846 --> 02:55:34.147]  That's the next phase.
[02:55:34.147 --> 02:55:35.288]  They've already been beta testing it.
[02:55:36.269 --> 02:55:47.439]  And again, the royal family in England, the government elites in... In fact, I've already done a report on this, but we should get it from last year and then re-air it tonight.
[02:55:47.439 --> 02:55:49.321]  But if you can't find it, I'll just re-do it.
[02:55:50.587 --> 02:55:56.110]  In fact, just have the news crew pull up, like, Chinese elite eat different food.
[02:55:56.110 --> 02:55:57.751]  German elite eat different food.
[02:55:57.751 --> 02:55:59.772]  British elite eat different food.
[02:55:59.772 --> 02:56:01.633]  German government gets clean vaccine.
[02:56:01.633 --> 02:56:03.494]  And then it says in the articles, L.A.
[02:56:03.494 --> 02:56:14.960]  Times, Financial Times of London, Der Spiegel, that, oh yeah, they have... In fact, one headline was, Communist Chinese have secret organic greenhouse farms all over the country.
[02:56:15.620 --> 02:56:16.341]  And it's the same deal.
[02:56:16.341 --> 02:56:18.002]  They truck it around.
[02:56:18.002 --> 02:56:20.704]  When the elites fly around, they have their own chefs on board.
[02:56:20.704 --> 02:56:24.707]  They don't go to restaurants or they go to special places where it's totally certified.
[02:56:24.707 --> 02:56:30.151]  That's why John Kerry famously has been in Wendy's with Teresa Hines-Kerry and won't even eat a french fry.
[02:56:30.791 --> 02:56:34.074]  You know, he famously said, take a bite, and he was like, oh, I'm not hungry.
[02:56:34.074 --> 02:56:36.997]  And then it's happened to other ones where, you know, Obama goes and eats the stuff.
[02:56:36.997 --> 02:56:37.677]  He doesn't care.
[02:56:37.677 --> 02:56:39.219]  He knows, ah, it's like Jack Daniels.
[02:56:39.219 --> 02:56:40.860]  I'm just going to eat this hamburger.
[02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:42.321]  But it's not really like Jack Daniels.
[02:56:42.321 --> 02:56:50.309]  You're designed to be able to handle some of that, and yeah, it'll rot your liver and kills 500,000 people a year, they estimate, alcoholism in this country, over 500,000 related.
[02:56:50.309 --> 02:56:52.751]  The point is, all of this is a cocktail of death.
[02:56:55.250 --> 02:56:55.830]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:58.512]  Political and corporate elite shun GM food on their own plate.
[02:56:58.512 --> 02:56:59.773]  Well, it's like Monsanto.
[02:56:59.773 --> 02:57:11.319]  1999, CNBC reported on it, so did CBC, and all their facilities worldwide.
[02:57:11.319 --> 02:57:17.923]  The engineering class, the biotech class demand totally organic, filtered water, everything at their facilities.
[02:57:17.923 --> 02:57:19.424]  That guy's at the end of this hour.
[02:57:19.424 --> 02:57:22.826]  Type in real quick, Monsanto has GMO-free cafeterias.
[02:57:25.916 --> 02:57:28.277]  Boy, but you're going to eat it.
[02:57:28.277 --> 02:57:29.538]  You're going to eat it.
[02:57:29.538 --> 02:57:30.859]  You're going to eat it.
[02:57:30.859 --> 02:57:33.100]  You know you can't help it.
[02:57:33.100 --> 02:57:34.321]  You know you'll want it.
[02:57:34.321 --> 02:57:36.663]  And I hear poor old Limbaugh.
[02:57:36.663 --> 02:57:38.344]  Incredible person.
[02:57:38.344 --> 02:57:40.765]  Anybody that can take 100 oxycontin a day and live, I admire.
[02:57:40.765 --> 02:57:43.227]  I mean, that'd kill like five horses, they estimate.
[02:57:43.227 --> 02:57:44.447]  I'm not trying to bash Rush.
[02:57:44.447 --> 02:57:46.409]  He gets up there and says, all GMOs is like...
[02:57:47.469 --> 02:57:53.112]  George Washington Carver breeding two types of, you know, plant together to make a better yield.
[02:57:53.112 --> 02:57:55.273]  It's nothing but hybridization.
[02:57:55.273 --> 02:58:10.581]  No, putting spider genes and human genes and a poison gene toxin released by a bacteria or a fungus or to put a snake venom into a crop where bugs can't eat it and then we feed it to humans.
[02:58:10.581 --> 02:58:12.262]  Hey look, the bugs won't eat it!
[02:58:12.262 --> 02:58:13.582]  That's great, it kills them, yeah.
[02:58:13.582 --> 02:58:14.103]  Hey, let's eat.
[02:58:14.103 --> 02:58:14.783]  Oh, that sounds good.
[02:58:14.783 --> 02:58:16.344]  Let me get some corn on the cob there immediately.
[02:58:17.156 --> 02:58:21.659]  I mean, it is just sheer lunacy to the power of a trillion.
[02:58:21.659 --> 02:58:22.840]  Okay?
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:24.882]  And we're all killing ourselves right now.
[02:58:24.882 --> 02:58:26.443]  Hell, I know I was brought up in all this.
[02:58:26.443 --> 02:58:27.424]  I can't even stop.
[02:58:27.424 --> 02:58:29.786]  I try to feed my kids non-GMO, but you're still out and stuff.
[02:58:29.786 --> 02:58:30.386]  You don't check.
[02:58:30.386 --> 02:58:31.107]  You don't know.
[02:58:31.107 --> 02:58:31.927]  You don't take the time.
[02:58:31.927 --> 02:58:33.308]  You know the cell phone's killing you.
[02:58:33.308 --> 02:58:34.569]  You know it's all killing you.
[02:58:34.569 --> 02:58:35.590]  Break out of the matrix!
[02:58:35.590 --> 02:58:36.731]  Break out of the trance!
[02:58:36.731 --> 02:58:37.331]  Awaken!
[02:58:37.331 --> 02:58:38.292]  Humanity!
[02:58:38.292 --> 02:58:38.932]  It's worth it!
[02:58:38.932 --> 02:58:39.933]  Love your children!
[02:58:39.933 --> 02:58:40.714]  Come on!

[02:59:52.304 --> 02:59:55.887]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.887 --> 02:59:59.089]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.107 --> 03:00:10.950]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:12.531]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.531 --> 03:00:14.092]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.092 --> 03:00:18.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.255 --> 03:00:23.899]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.899 --> 03:00:25.920]  Let me just say it simply to the point.
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:35.667]  The entire global elite, from communist countries to western countries, does not take vaccines or eat any GMO and are obsessed with keeping that secret from the public.
[03:00:36.894 --> 03:00:40.216]  Now, 2 plus 2 equals what?
[03:00:40.216 --> 03:00:42.138]  Then you know what the GMO does to people.
[03:00:42.138 --> 03:00:43.619]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[03:00:43.619 --> 03:00:45.360]  They're killing us.
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:50.284]  And now they've got liability protection.
[03:00:50.284 --> 03:00:53.286]  The government said so, it's good.
[03:00:53.286 --> 03:00:55.007]  Kevin, in Boston.
[03:00:55.948 --> 03:01:01.890]  Why did the Secret Service try to stop Obama when he's eating GMO food for the cameras to show the slaves what to eat?
[03:01:01.890 --> 03:01:03.531]  Then he runs home and eats organic.
[03:01:03.531 --> 03:01:05.371]  I wonder if he goes and vomits like a bulimic.
[03:01:05.371 --> 03:01:06.612]  He looks like one in the back.
[03:01:06.612 --> 03:01:08.572]  Looks like he's anorexic.
[03:01:08.572 --> 03:01:11.133]  Kevin, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:01:11.133 --> 03:01:12.774]  Hey Alex, you hear me?
[03:01:12.774 --> 03:01:14.234]  Yes sir, I hear you loud and clear.
[03:01:14.234 --> 03:01:14.934]  Roger, roger.
[03:01:14.934 --> 03:01:17.555]  Alright, good man.
[03:01:17.555 --> 03:01:22.877]  Well I'm from Boston, I'm a 19 year old kid and I'm just really sick of what's going on, you know what I mean?
[03:01:24.366 --> 03:01:25.967]  Well, sounds like you're an extremist.
[03:01:25.967 --> 03:01:29.810]  Not liking and having an opinion is a conspiracy theory, sir.
[03:01:29.810 --> 03:01:32.192]  Do what you're told or it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:01:32.192 --> 03:01:35.114]  Do you have a favorite flavor of ice cream?
[03:01:35.114 --> 03:01:37.335]  What's my favorite flavor?
[03:01:37.335 --> 03:01:38.056]  Chocolate.
[03:01:38.056 --> 03:01:39.657]  That is discrimination.
[03:01:39.657 --> 03:01:41.018]  You're discriminating.
[03:01:41.018 --> 03:01:43.319]  And I know you're making a choice which doesn't exist.
[03:01:43.319 --> 03:01:44.560]  You're not allowed to have a thought.
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:45.521]  I know, it's sad.
[03:01:45.521 --> 03:01:50.484]  Not only racist, not only racist, racist, racist, but conspiracy theory.
[03:01:50.484 --> 03:01:51.025]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:01:52.185 --> 03:01:53.026]  You know what's sad?
[03:01:53.026 --> 03:02:00.111]  With all my friends and stuff, I try to tell them about what's going on, about all the tyranny, about... And they say it doesn't exist.
[03:02:00.111 --> 03:02:00.992]  And they don't listen.
[03:02:00.992 --> 03:02:03.334]  It's like they don't have their own thoughts anymore.
[03:02:03.334 --> 03:02:04.195]  They're good people.
[03:02:04.195 --> 03:02:05.976]  That's reasonable.
[03:02:05.976 --> 03:02:07.437]  Yeah, it is.
[03:02:07.437 --> 03:02:09.098]  And everyone has the iPhone now.
[03:02:09.098 --> 03:02:12.241]  It's like we're living inside of a clone, kinda.
[03:02:12.241 --> 03:02:13.962]  Well, it's gonna get a lot funner.
[03:02:13.962 --> 03:02:17.265]  I mean, hey, they like type 2 diabetes and death and everything.
[03:02:17.265 --> 03:02:19.487]  Keep drinking that Diet Coke.
[03:02:19.487 --> 03:02:20.447]  It's all admitted it's killing them.
[03:02:20.447 --> 03:02:20.828]  Isn't that fun?
[03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:24.812]  I just really feel bad for, like, my generation, my future.
[03:02:24.812 --> 03:02:26.313]  We don't even get to live our lives now.
[03:02:26.313 --> 03:02:28.174]  You know what I mean?
[03:02:28.174 --> 03:02:30.195]  Well, whoever said you did live, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:02:30.195 --> 03:02:31.736]  That is a conspiracy theory.
[03:02:31.736 --> 03:02:33.557]  That mothers ever breastfed was a conspiracy.
[03:02:33.557 --> 03:02:36.819]  That men ever loved women was a conspiracy theory.
[03:02:36.819 --> 03:02:40.622]  The future is Japan with poop clubs on every corner.
[03:02:40.622 --> 03:02:41.763]  People pooping on each other.
[03:02:41.763 --> 03:02:43.364]  That's wholesome and good.
[03:02:43.364 --> 03:02:43.764]  You're bad.
[03:02:45.488 --> 03:02:47.669]  I think, Alex, I appreciate what you're doing, man.
[03:02:47.669 --> 03:02:50.150]  Like, you're waking people up, you're getting the truth out.
[03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:56.553]  Like, it needs to be done, because it's getting to a point where, like, it's just over the top, you know what I mean?
[03:02:56.553 --> 03:02:59.554]  Hey, reality is over the top, brother.
[03:02:59.554 --> 03:03:00.155]  Over and out.
[03:03:00.155 --> 03:03:03.096]  Let's take another call from another extremist.
[03:03:03.096 --> 03:03:05.317]  Let's talk to Ron in Connecticut.
[03:03:05.317 --> 03:03:06.978]  Connecticut doesn't exist if the government says so.
[03:03:06.978 --> 03:03:08.838]  Go ahead, Ron.
[03:03:08.838 --> 03:03:09.439]  Hi, Alex.
[03:03:09.439 --> 03:03:12.860]  First time caller from the Constitution State.
[03:03:12.860 --> 03:03:13.601]  Doesn't exist.
[03:03:13.601 --> 03:03:14.521]  Conspiracy.
[03:03:16.461 --> 03:03:22.824]  Well, what I wanted to talk to you about today was the little banking thing there with the Chase Bank the other day.
[03:03:22.824 --> 03:03:35.109]  I was listening to you on the radio and my question to you was, is this the tip of the spear that the banksters are pointing at us?
[03:03:35.109 --> 03:03:43.532]  Yeah, they're just conditioning us to take all our money out of the bank and give it to private individuals and to say that's normal and to say you're an extremist if you don't like it.
[03:03:44.650 --> 03:03:49.275]  But do you think that there's a pivotal event that's coming or has come already?
[03:03:49.275 --> 03:03:57.143]  I think it's going to come in lots of little events until they stage a nuke attack or a new war and say that's why all the markets go belly up.
[03:03:57.143 --> 03:04:02.589]  And then they've got to take all the money out of your account because they've got to fight Al-Qaeda or something or fight North Korea.
[03:04:03.547 --> 03:04:10.728]  And notice North Korea's acting up, right as all these movies come out about North Korea doing exactly what the movies say they're going to do.
[03:04:10.728 --> 03:04:12.489]  And you're like, well is North Korea working for the US?
[03:04:12.489 --> 03:04:13.269]  No.
[03:04:13.269 --> 03:04:16.369]  North Korea works for China that works for the New World Order.
[03:04:16.369 --> 03:04:23.711]  See, the New World Order runs America, and it runs China, and it runs Europe, and it's like crashing us into each other.
[03:04:23.711 --> 03:04:24.351]  Ha ha!
[03:04:24.351 --> 03:04:25.791]  Destroy humanity!
[03:04:25.791 --> 03:04:28.271]  Destroy suicide nets in China!
[03:04:28.271 --> 03:04:30.332]  You know, mass vaccine deaths in America!
[03:04:30.332 --> 03:04:31.012]  Ha ha ha!
[03:04:32.886 --> 03:04:34.007]  Absolutely.
[03:04:34.007 --> 03:04:40.410]  And, you know, this whole thing is sort of, uh, there's a whole story on top of a story.
[03:04:40.410 --> 03:04:42.691]  And maybe I might just shine some light on you.
[03:04:42.691 --> 03:04:49.494]  Um, I uncovered something the other day and I know this may sound fantastic, but I was up in Hartford, Connecticut.
[03:04:49.494 --> 03:04:50.955]  Hold on, you gotta send me an email.
[03:04:50.955 --> 03:04:51.415]  What is it?
[03:04:51.415 --> 03:04:51.696]  Tell us.
[03:04:51.696 --> 03:04:53.076]  We got five seconds.
[03:04:53.076 --> 03:04:53.757]  Okay.
[03:04:53.757 --> 03:04:54.857]  The body of J.P.
[03:04:54.857 --> 03:04:57.519]  Morgan and his wife and three sons.
[03:04:57.519 --> 03:05:00.520]  Their graves were ransacked and the bodies were stolen.
