[00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:09.737]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:12.858]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:17.059]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:21.121]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:40.474]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the third day of the new year, 2013.
[00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:46.234]  And we are going to be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.234 --> 00:00:48.315]  We do have Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us.
[00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:57.797]  They are going ahead with the North American Union Napa Superhighway program, despite telling the public that first it didn't exist, and then the legislature shot it down twice.
[00:00:57.797 --> 00:00:58.998]  It affects the entire nation.
[00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:02.139]  It begins down in Mexico, through Texas, up into Canada.
[00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:06.880]  They even have the whole highway planned out with the highway markers for all the way into Canada.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.981]  But then when you talk about it, they say it doesn't exist.
[00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:18.534]  And that's part of the psychological warfare tactic they use in general.
[00:01:18.534 --> 00:01:28.140]  The legislation is introduced and has passed out a committee in Illinois to ban all semi-autos, even pump shotguns, pump rifles.
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.002]  I saw a comment on Infowars.com, they said pump rifles.
[00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.304]  There's actually a lot of pump rifles.
[00:01:33.304 --> 00:01:37.587]  The point is, is that it's everything but bolt action.
[00:01:37.587 --> 00:01:39.908]  And the NRA of course is responding.
[00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:42.624]  To it.
[00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:44.665]  And it looks like it's going to pass.
[00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:46.266]  Very, very close today.
[00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:54.109]  And Obama is quoted as saying he wants to quickly go for immigration reform, totally open borders, end of America.
[00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.410]  Just not even having a country.
[00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.171]  No other country lets you do that.
[00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:58.891]  It's globalism.
[00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.192]  It's a new world order.
[00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:03.073]  And gun control.
[00:02:03.073 --> 00:02:06.634]  So it's hammer down.
[00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:07.274]  And you notice
[00:02:09.855 --> 00:02:13.738]  That in mainline, quote, conservative circles, they're not even discussing this.
[00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:19.803]  They're talking about tax increases and the fiscal cliff, which is important, but the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:22.425]  But this pales in significance.
[00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:26.849]  And I didn't even get to it yesterday because it's so well known that Obama's one of the greatest liars in history.
[00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.731]  Just because we've gotten deeper into the corruption.
[00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:33.434]  He's just a puppet, but the system is lying through their mouthpiece.
[00:02:33.434 --> 00:02:37.697]  Where he said, I'll never raise your payroll taxes, I'll never raise this tax, that tax.
[00:02:37.697 --> 00:02:39.599]  They're raising payroll taxes, you name it.
[00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.563]  A whole bunch of new taxes, fines, fees, regulations.
[00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:47.786]  One of the crew members calculated on their paycheck.
[00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:55.950]  Uh, what the new payroll tax is that started and it comes out to about 200, a little over $200 a month.
[00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.852]  So we're gonna do a news piece on that.
[00:02:58.852 --> 00:03:05.015]  Um, or I guess whoever volunteers around here, we can black out their pay stub and all that.
[00:03:05.015 --> 00:03:13.860]  But government knows when you work for a company, they can just keep adding fees and regulations and, and, and, and, and surcharges onto things.
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.482]  Uh, one of my crew members got pulled over literally.
[00:03:19.537 --> 00:03:26.242]  Two days after his insurance expired, because he was going to sell the truck, because he did, he did sell the truck.
[00:03:26.242 --> 00:03:28.844]  The illegal aliens, of course, are released.
[00:03:28.844 --> 00:03:31.225]  They're allowed to not have insurance.
[00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:32.546]  And I think he's going to do a news piece on it.
[00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:37.990]  It's not a secret, but it was a $300 ticket.
[00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.891]  It's all automated.
[00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:41.533]  Turned out the cops had cameras that were scanning and reading it.
[00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:43.594]  That's why they pulled him over.
[00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:44.695]  And then they said there's going to be a
[00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:46.386]  No.
[00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:20.298]  You've seen those cartoons where the wolf looks at the rabbit or looks at the chicken and then actually sees it as like a, you know, skinned piece of meat on a spit and then starts drooling?
[00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:25.940]  When government sees you, that's what they see is a meal.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.521]  And they see a mark.
[00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:31.482]  Americans are now known as planetary chumps.
[00:04:31.482 --> 00:04:32.863]  We are now known as dinner.
[00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:41.869]  And all of us, more and more, have to do whatever we can to get out of the system, sabotage the system, not go along with it, because it's totally illegitimate.
[00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:47.413]  In fact, will you guys pull me the article Steve Watson did about checkpoints all over the highways?
[00:04:47.413 --> 00:04:50.716]  By the way, now they're gang checkpoints where they search your vehicle.
[00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:53.739]  I mean, this country is in martial law.
[00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:55.680]  It's what degree of it.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.323]  And we've got forced inoculation news as well coming up.
[00:05:01.485 --> 00:05:07.069]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.311]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:13.133]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:16.135]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:05:16.135 --> 00:05:19.137]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:05:19.637 --> 00:05:24.839]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:27.520]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.181]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:34.942]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[00:05:34.942 --> 00:05:38.563]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.

[00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:36.826]  A new world order.
[00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:37.848]  A new world order.
[00:08:52.273 --> 00:08:55.315]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:08:55.315 --> 00:09:07.122]  It is Thursday, the third day of January 2013, and we are going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:09:07.122 --> 00:09:07.622]  Wow!
[00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:08.983]  Where to begin?
[00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:20.570]  I have a personal story of here in our office of just unmitigated, over-the-top oppression and tyranny.
[00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:34.852]  Going on with one of our crew members, who we're going to keep anonymous at this point, and I'm going to tell that story calmly at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:34.852 --> 00:09:44.234]  And I will tie it into everything else that's happening, but you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that the globalists are moving on every front.
[00:09:44.234 --> 00:09:48.415]  They are not just coming to confiscate the guns.
[00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:49.475]  I am so busy
[00:09:51.627 --> 00:10:15.025]  Working and spending you know time with my family and things that I I never have time to go up bird hunting or deer hunting I never even have time to really go to the shooting range Maybe two or three times a year I have time to go shooting now or I have people visit and they want to shoot because I live out in the country now So I guess I'm shooting a little bit more than I used to Growing up and I shot every week
[00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:24.708]  And became a pretty good rifleman, even shot competitively a little bit with rifles and handguns.
[00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:29.470]  But that is a side issue rabbit trail.
[00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:39.935]  It's not that I'm freaked out about physically Dianne Feinstein now introducing the bill today to confiscate most firearms.
[00:10:39.935 --> 00:10:45.177]  It's not even the idea of going and laying them outside and the police come and inspect your house without warrants.
[00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:46.058]  That's what they're announcing.
[00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:50.479]  And they set up checkpoints on highways that are now searching for firearms.
[00:10:50.479 --> 00:10:52.120]  That's now happening all over the country.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.221]  They're even taking legal ones.
[00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:54.781]  They don't care if the law says you can have a gun.
[00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:55.982]  They just take it.
[00:10:55.982 --> 00:10:57.222]  Right here in Texas as well.
[00:10:57.222 --> 00:11:01.765]  I mean, it's just martial law being phased in.
[00:11:01.765 --> 00:11:03.825]  It's that I know what comes with it.
[00:11:03.825 --> 00:11:06.987]  And it's going to be taxes increasing on everything.
[00:11:06.987 --> 00:11:08.368]  It's going to be VAT.
[00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:08.888]  It's going to be...
[00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.931]  Increased sales taxes.
[00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:15.634]  It's going to be increased taxes on energy.
[00:11:15.634 --> 00:11:17.915]  It is going to be increased payroll taxes.
[00:11:17.915 --> 00:11:19.296]  That's already happening.
[00:11:19.296 --> 00:11:21.297]  Surcharges.
[00:11:21.297 --> 00:11:23.078]  And it's designed.
[00:11:23.078 --> 00:11:26.300]  So many economists say this will destroy the economy.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.861]  Well, that's the plan.
[00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:31.303]  They've got 100 plus million people on one form of welfare or another.
[00:11:31.303 --> 00:11:33.465]  They want to go up to 200 million.
[00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:36.847]  They've gone from 25 million on food stamps to 49 million in four years.
[00:11:38.038 --> 00:11:39.879]  And they intend to double that.
[00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:42.480]  And they don't mince words about it.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.782]  This is your domestication.
[00:11:44.782 --> 00:11:47.883]  America has always been the target.
[00:11:47.883 --> 00:11:53.066]  And we are to be fully brought down like Poland or Ukraine under Soviet occupation.
[00:11:53.066 --> 00:11:54.847]  And I've studied history in depth.
[00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:58.609]  That is the plan.
[00:11:58.609 --> 00:12:06.594]  And people could say, because I've tried to psychoanalyze myself, is it a macho action?
[00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:14.794]  That I am going to stay behind in this country and go toe-to-toe with this.
[00:12:14.794 --> 00:12:16.235]  And no, that is not why I'm doing it.
[00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:19.818]  It's not out of some hatred of the New World Order and what they do.
[00:12:19.818 --> 00:12:28.064]  It's out of an absolute duty and commitment and pledge to fight these people.
[00:12:28.064 --> 00:12:33.088]  I just want to get it across to you, ladies and gentlemen, that they're hurting innocents all over the world.
[00:12:35.444 --> 00:12:48.352]  And they're doing things that when you're even mildly informed are so over the top that it boggles the mind.
[00:12:48.352 --> 00:12:54.255]  They give premature babies vaccines now in this country and kill them.
[00:12:54.255 --> 00:12:58.358]  They know full well what they do.
[00:12:58.358 --> 00:13:04.742]  They give pregnant women vaccines and push them and tell them in hospitals it's the law when they come in to get checkups.
[00:13:05.862 --> 00:13:06.654]  When there is no law.
[00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:18.881]  Guys, I sent you probably 50 IMs, and it's clear there's a problem.
[00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.602]  You need to reload that.
[00:13:20.602 --> 00:13:24.124]  Because I had the definitions and the history of gaslighting.
[00:13:24.124 --> 00:13:25.704]  It's a political term.
[00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:35.449]  So if that's not in there, I need you to go get me just the top four or five up, you know, the use of gaslighting, the psychological term gaslighting, because I want to cover gaslighting.
[00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:42.152]  It's just one term to cover a game the globalists play, and they define it as gaslighting.
[00:13:42.152 --> 00:13:42.732]  And it's when
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:53.046]  You walk in and you find your wife in bed with another man, and she says, there's no man here, and the guy gets up, dresses, and walks out.
[00:13:53.046 --> 00:13:57.030]  They've psychologically found most people will actually go, well, am I crazy?
[00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.591]  That's not a guy right there?
[00:13:58.591 --> 00:14:06.458]  And because of denial, how we've been programmed through television, gaslighting is more and more effective today than it's ever been.
[00:14:11.957 --> 00:14:21.202]  So I'm going to go over gaslighting today, because I read that term years ago, but I came back across it.
[00:14:21.202 --> 00:14:26.105]  And I'm like, that's a great term for what I've been trying to describe.
[00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:30.308]  So many times you learn something and you forget it, and they've got different terms for it.
[00:14:30.308 --> 00:14:33.490]  They've got Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.172]  I mean, there's a lot of different shit, learned helplessness, but
[00:14:38.683 --> 00:14:44.549]  They've been building the Napa Superhighway from Mexico into Texas and up into Oklahoma.
[00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:48.313]  It's all over the news here, and they go on CNN over the years.
[00:14:48.313 --> 00:14:51.196]  I've played the clips and go, Ron Paul is insane.
[00:14:51.196 --> 00:14:53.739]  There is no trans-Texas corridor in Napa Superhighway.
[00:14:53.739 --> 00:14:55.360]  When it's all Department of Transportation,
[00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:59.423]  And publicly admitted and billboards up everywhere.
[00:14:59.423 --> 00:15:00.984]  Then they go, it doesn't exist.
[00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:03.566]  And then they say, oh, we're not going to build it now.
[00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:10.250]  And then they sign an order and bring it back in, even though the legislature said no, because they're having the states go and pay for it with taxpayer money.
[00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.512]  And then the globalists get the tax money off the toll roads.
[00:15:14.512 --> 00:15:20.396]  Or it's like CBS, NBC, ABC, all of them saying Wayne LaPierre is a liar.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.503]  There are no guns in Israel.
[00:15:23.503 --> 00:15:25.025]  There are no armed teachers.
[00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:26.407]  There are no armed citizens.
[00:15:26.407 --> 00:15:27.549]  That is a lie.
[00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:30.393]  The answer to mass shootings is not arming people.
[00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:31.795]  And the media went, whoa!
[00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:34.259]  LaPierre's got egg on his face!
[00:15:34.259 --> 00:15:35.180]  Oh, man!
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.202]  That guy's a liar!
[00:15:36.983 --> 00:15:52.155]  I mean, it's an absolute fact, in triplicate, that since the 80s they've armed the teachers, and when they go on field trips they've got, you know, M-16s, and it's in Haretz, Jerusalem Post, anybody can go type, Israeli teachers armed, Israeli citizens armed.
[00:15:52.155 --> 00:15:53.636]  It's a known fact.
[00:15:53.636 --> 00:15:59.060]  You can go read the Israeli laws on the Knesset website, and we've done newscasts on it showing you.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.582]  But see, we can't reach but a few million people a day.
[00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:13.209]  And even those listening on radio, once they've been gas lit, once they've been manipulated, once everything's been fogged, they're like, well, he says they got guns, but I've never been there.
[00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:17.351]  And it's just, it's just incredible.
[00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:24.875]  Yeah, there's Fox News showing the teachers with the armed teachers guards bolster school security in Israel.
[00:16:24.875 --> 00:16:26.777]  That's from December 30th.
[00:16:28.348 --> 00:16:31.490]  As bad as Fox News is, at least they didn't, you know, try to hoax their audience.
[00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:41.999]  That's why they got more audiences than all the cable news channels combined, because they at least tell enough of the truth so people don't think they're total operatives and actually watch them.
[00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:47.343]  And that's part of the hoax, though, with MSNBC and CNN, whose top shows have a half million viewers apiece.
[00:16:47.343 --> 00:16:55.349]  I mean, that's, that's, I mean, there's big shows in Chicago and Dallas and New York that per hour have over a half million listeners on one radio station.
[00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:58.215]  I mean, I can look at the numbers on affiliates.
[00:16:58.215 --> 00:16:59.577]  We've got some of our bigger affiliates.
[00:16:59.577 --> 00:17:06.164]  We have 110,000 listeners an hour.
[00:17:06.164 --> 00:17:10.970]  And that's right off the dash, you know, instant meter computers.
[00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.232]  100% people are listening.
[00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:15.049]  It's
[00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:41.702]  And of course, they're thinking it'll be a big news event because we'll have an argument or something.
[00:17:41.702 --> 00:17:44.346]  And that is how Piers Morgan actually does have an audience.
[00:17:44.346 --> 00:17:46.088]  His actual show doesn't have an audience.
[00:17:46.088 --> 00:17:49.472]  The derivative of it does get picked up and put on a lot of other channels.
[00:17:49.472 --> 00:17:56.080]  That's why he's number one on CNN, is that he at least knows to have enough controversy and people he disagrees with on.
[00:17:57.236 --> 00:17:59.077]  To try to get some viewers.
[00:17:59.077 --> 00:18:03.359]  So, I mean, it's a good move by the Pentagon that on record runs CNN.
[00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:13.124]  That's come out in the Washington Post, even, that it's run by the Department of Defense and is basically a PSYOP operation out of Atlanta, New York, and Los Angeles, and D.C.
[00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:17.526]  Well, not just a PSYOP, it's far beyond that.
[00:18:17.526 --> 00:18:22.469]  But still, there's the, oh my gosh, you know, Piers Morgan, you're going to be on there?
[00:18:22.469 --> 00:18:26.731]  I mean, it's almost not worth it to go down to the satellite uplink and do the interview.
[00:18:28.513 --> 00:18:30.234]  Seriously, and I'm not just saying that.
[00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.515]  I turn down every week offers.
[00:18:32.515 --> 00:18:33.956]  Don't even call people back.
[00:18:33.956 --> 00:18:34.877]  I should.
[00:18:34.877 --> 00:18:36.618]  Some of there might be something good comes along.
[00:18:36.618 --> 00:18:44.142]  Reality TV shows, Discovery Channel, History Channel, BBC, and they send emails back going, we're a huge show.
[00:18:44.142 --> 00:18:47.765]  Now, I did want to go on BBC Radio last week, but I was out that day and missed it.
[00:18:48.405 --> 00:18:52.047]  Just because it was that World Service Show that's on everywhere and it's live?
[00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:54.469]  That I would have done.
[00:18:54.469 --> 00:18:56.590]  But I don't like tape stuff because they can manipulate it.
[00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.192]  The point is, I'm not up here bragging, hey I don't need them.
[00:18:59.192 --> 00:19:02.775]  It's that they are a hoax.
[00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:09.339]  But in a way I probably should go participate just because the General Lemmings see it and think, oh man, you've really arrived.
[00:19:10.157 --> 00:19:14.541]  I mean, my goodness, you, you were on The View.
[00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:17.323]  And The View, actually, I did get a big response out of.
[00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:23.748]  I've been on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, Discovery Channel, History Channel, you name it, I've been on it.
[00:19:23.748 --> 00:19:30.474]  A&E, 60 Minutes, Extra, Hard Copy, you name it, I've been on it.
[00:19:30.474 --> 00:19:33.096]  In 17 years.
[00:19:33.096 --> 00:19:35.578]  And it just doesn't do anything.
[00:19:35.578 --> 00:19:38.260]  Because you've got a bunch of zombies watching it.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.101]  Now when we come back,
[00:19:40.233 --> 00:19:41.033]  But again, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:41.033 --> 00:19:45.015]  It still creates the illusion that they're in charge and that everybody believes them.
[00:19:45.015 --> 00:19:49.857]  So you've got to understand, folks, it's a total facade.
[00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:58.040]  You ever seen those Hollywood facades to a tour of the studios where it looks like a house, but it's just the front with boards propping it up behind it?
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:58.921]  It's a facade.
[00:20:01.772 --> 00:20:07.278]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:20:07.278 --> 00:20:10.441]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:13.224]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:20:13.224 --> 00:20:16.168]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:20:16.168 --> 00:20:19.151]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:20:19.631 --> 00:20:24.757]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.

[00:24:11.699 --> 00:24:16.000]  Here's USA Today, Huffington Post, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.941]  We can punch it up for TV viewers that are watching on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:26.763]  Or just type in tax increase on 77% and literally dozens of articles will pop up.
[00:24:26.763 --> 00:24:30.324]  77% of Americans to have their taxes increased.
[00:24:30.324 --> 00:24:32.065]  It'll just be added on to your paycheck.
[00:24:33.085 --> 00:24:37.189]  Or taken out if you actually, you know, file your own taxes.
[00:24:37.189 --> 00:24:39.491]  And we've got this clip of Obama here.
[00:24:39.491 --> 00:24:41.593]  That's just, that's just on payroll taxes right there.
[00:24:41.593 --> 00:24:47.838]  There's a bunch of other taxes and the Obama surcharge on investments and 401ks and that's just the beginning.
[00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.751]  I can make a firm pledge, under my plan, no family, making
[00:25:13.055 --> 00:25:18.577]  Less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.
[00:25:18.577 --> 00:25:27.259]  Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.
[00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:30.860]  Okay, so capital gains went up in Obamacare.
[00:25:32.432 --> 00:25:34.034]  And payroll taxes went up.
[00:25:34.034 --> 00:25:37.297]  I mean, he broke every single pledge.
[00:25:37.297 --> 00:25:39.259]  And that's all he does.
[00:25:39.259 --> 00:25:42.361]  And a lot of Obama people over the first three years really woke up to him.
[00:25:42.361 --> 00:25:43.583]  His approval rating went down.
[00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:52.171]  But once it was the left versus right, rah, rah, Obama, Romney, you're a racist if you don't like Obama, the yuppies and trendies, everybody said, well,
[00:25:53.226 --> 00:26:02.473]  Hey, Obama's gonna win, and then when Obama won, which was fraud, it was fraud to begin with, the fix was in, just like with the Republicans and the tax increases right now.
[00:26:02.473 --> 00:26:07.657]  It was rigged from who was in the race to the fact that Obama clearly didn't win.
[00:26:07.657 --> 00:26:13.861]  They didn't care, he was the guy who could create the most division, so they put him in.
[00:26:13.861 --> 00:26:18.725]  And people are like, hey, my guy won, just you're angry about it.
[00:26:18.725 --> 00:26:19.165]  And I'm like,
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.221]  Do you understand Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney work for the very same foreign banks?
[00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:40.965]  And literally, when Mitt Romney was governor, he supported abortion, government abortion funding, open borders, takings all semi-auto, handguns and rifles, carbon taxes, and they go, sure, you lost, I won.
[00:26:40.965 --> 00:26:43.086]  And it's like, listen, this is dangerous, okay?
[00:26:43.686 --> 00:26:45.286]  They're gonna destroy the economy.
[00:26:45.286 --> 00:26:48.127]  Uh-huh, right, right, uh-huh.
[00:26:48.127 --> 00:26:49.068]  You're just a racist.
[00:26:49.068 --> 00:26:55.430]  And it'd usually be a white person calling in or, you know, on the street telling me this or, you know, commenting or newscasters.
[00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:02.011]  And see, they play along like they're part of the power structure, they're winning.
[00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:03.412]  And now, all over the country,
[00:27:04.827 --> 00:27:10.413]  In fact, guys, when you guys print me the article, I had it on the nightly news last night, but I think it's on the other side.
[00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:14.117]  You can either jog over there and then try to find it or just print me.
[00:27:14.117 --> 00:27:18.141]  Teachers fired for not taking vaccines.
[00:27:18.141 --> 00:27:19.963]  And there's another one.
[00:27:19.963 --> 00:27:21.805]  Nurses fired.
[00:27:21.805 --> 00:27:23.827]  Suddenly, all over the country, there's no law.
[00:27:24.713 --> 00:27:34.161]  And they've actually lost lawsuits before, and it's racketeering when they make you do this, but they just count on ignorance, and they don't care if they lose lawsuits, because it's all government-funded.
[00:27:34.161 --> 00:27:52.417]  It's about medical tyranny and forcing you to take shots, and they're training police under the state's model Health Emergency Powers Act to forcibly inoculate you, and that's what TSA putting their hands on you about, and that's what highway checkpoints are all about, is they're getting you ready to put their hands on you.
[00:27:52.777 --> 00:27:58.022]  And I'm going to get into Feinstein's bill to physically confiscate your guns being introduced today.
[00:27:58.022 --> 00:28:01.404]  We told you yesterday Illinois was going to introduce a bill according to the NRA.
[00:28:01.404 --> 00:28:02.245]  They've done it.
[00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:04.487]  It's out of committee, set to pass today.
[00:28:04.487 --> 00:28:13.214]  Looks like it may pass right now to make all people in Illinois turn their semi-autos in and pump.
[00:28:13.214 --> 00:28:14.856]  Everything but bolt action is going to be turned in.
[00:28:15.296 --> 00:28:18.459]  And they've got your FOID card, they know where to come get your gun.
[00:28:18.459 --> 00:28:19.279]  So they're coming.
[00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:23.923]  And it'll be on the news, the trucks and the police and people resisting being killed.
[00:28:23.923 --> 00:28:27.466]  And it'll be patriotism to kill American gun owners.
[00:28:27.466 --> 00:28:28.507]  And they deserve it.
[00:28:28.507 --> 00:28:31.529]  They did Sandy Hook and they're all Klan members anyways.
[00:28:31.529 --> 00:28:34.752]  Remember when a month ago they were calling us Klan members and murderers?
[00:28:34.752 --> 00:28:36.033]  You're like, that makes no sense.
[00:28:36.033 --> 00:28:37.134]  Why are they just saying that?
[00:28:37.134 --> 00:28:39.696]  Because they're demonizing us.
[00:28:39.696 --> 00:28:43.419]  Okay, see, you never saw demonization like that before, did you?
[00:28:43.419 --> 00:28:44.620]  See, they're taking
[00:28:45.894 --> 00:28:49.417]  All the safety's off, politically.
[00:28:49.417 --> 00:28:50.838]  They're announcing all of it.
[00:28:50.838 --> 00:28:51.219]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:28:51.219 --> 00:28:53.701]  Nurses fired for refusing flu shot.
[00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:55.902]  All over the country.
[00:28:55.902 --> 00:29:02.408]  And now they're telling people that have children, you're not gonna get your kid if you don't take the shot.
[00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:06.631]  To my crew.
[00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:09.714]  To my crew.
[00:29:09.714 --> 00:29:10.995]  Now, we're recording them and stuff.
[00:29:10.995 --> 00:29:14.578]  I'm not letting them know that it's my guy and they're just to document all this nightmare.
[00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:17.585]  To get them.
[00:29:17.585 --> 00:29:21.228]  But the point is, is that I'm gonna, it's just this country, folks.
[00:29:21.228 --> 00:29:27.955]  I've got mainstream news announcing checkpoints nationwide at permanent highway checkpoints.
[00:29:27.955 --> 00:29:30.177]  Like you've had 100 miles into the border?
[00:29:30.177 --> 00:29:35.942]  Nationwide, you're gonna drive up to police checkpoints, they're gonna search ya, TSA's gonna be there, it's been announced.
[00:29:35.942 --> 00:29:38.485]  I've got those articles here.
[00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:39.606]  It's martial law, folks.
[00:29:41.548 --> 00:29:44.172]  And they're gonna set up machine gun nests.
[00:29:44.172 --> 00:29:47.056]  You're gonna be under machine gun point when you pull up to these.
[00:29:47.056 --> 00:29:49.640]  We're going under Fallujah control.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.042]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.042 --> 00:29:53.586]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.586 --> 00:29:56.269]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.249 --> 00:31:06.831]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:10.071]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:31:10.071 --> 00:31:12.892]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:31:12.892 --> 00:31:15.893]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:31:15.893 --> 00:31:19.414]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:31:19.414 --> 00:31:24.615]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:31:24.615 --> 00:31:27.296]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:31:27.296 --> 00:31:30.297]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:31:30.937 --> 00:31:33.058]  I'm taking control of my future.
[00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:34.698]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[00:31:34.698 --> 00:31:38.619]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.

[00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:51.002]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:31:51.002 --> 00:31:54.163]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[00:31:54.163 --> 00:31:58.644]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:03.113]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[00:32:03.113 --> 00:32:09.076]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:32:09.076 --> 00:32:15.660]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:21.343]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:32:21.343 --> 00:32:24.985]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:32:25.185 --> 00:32:28.986]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[00:32:28.986 --> 00:32:33.587]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[00:32:33.587 --> 00:32:36.087]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:39.928]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[00:32:39.928 --> 00:32:44.369]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[00:32:44.369 --> 00:32:47.010]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.171]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:23.343]  Some people say a man is made out of mud A poor man's made out of muscle and blood Muscle and blood and skin and bones A mind that's weak and a back that's strong You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
[00:33:23.343 --> 00:33:26.825]  Another day older and deeper in debt St.
[00:33:26.825 --> 00:33:32.989]  Peter, don't you call me cause I can't go I owe my soul to the company store
[00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:41.591]  Monday through Friday from 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:33:41.591 --> 00:33:41.971]  Central.
[00:33:41.971 --> 00:33:44.834]  We're live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:44.834 --> 00:33:52.780]  And of course don't forget ladies and gentlemen that we also have InfoWars Nightly News 7 o'clock Central every single evening.
[00:33:54.261 --> 00:34:07.824]  Every single evening at 7 o'clock central and one membership to Infowarsnews.com helps us pay for the bandwidth and expand the TV and filmmaking operations.
[00:34:07.824 --> 00:34:11.025]  And one membership then gets an additional 10 people.
[00:34:11.025 --> 00:34:16.006]  So really it's a total of 11, the banners on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:16.006 --> 00:34:20.007]  They say that it is get one membership and share it with 10 people.
[00:34:20.007 --> 00:34:21.707]  That's technically 11 memberships.
[00:34:22.347 --> 00:34:31.984]  The same username and passcodes can be logged in simultaneously from 11 different computers with the same username and passcode.
[00:34:33.459 --> 00:34:38.020]  That is less than 59 cents per person per month.
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:49.082]  You've absolutely got to go get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership or buy five or six of them and support us and then put the username and passcode you create that's for the site.
[00:34:49.082 --> 00:34:55.464]  Simple names, you know, so people can remember it and go give them maybe cards to your boss or your employees or your church.
[00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:07.534]  I mean, you could go get three memberships that would be like, I guess, $17, $18 a month, and that would be 30 plus memberships.
[00:35:07.534 --> 00:35:13.537]  And then go out and get friends and family to tune in every night.
[00:35:13.537 --> 00:35:20.460]  We put archives up in high def, all the films, e-books, a bunch of other documentaries we've been authorized to post up there.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.321]  I mean, it really is a first class site now.
[00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:24.942]  The new film, Strategic Relocation.
[00:35:27.717 --> 00:35:29.698]  Special documentaries, all of it.
[00:35:29.698 --> 00:35:32.798]  This is the future of the real media.
[00:35:32.798 --> 00:35:35.579]  This is the real cutting edge.
[00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:45.002]  And we are continuing, I mean, in perpetuity, that you can go get a monthly membership for $5.95 and 11 people can use it simultaneously.
[00:35:45.002 --> 00:35:53.684]  And I'll tell you, most people aren't going to tune in, you know, at the same time, at 7 o'clock every night when the show goes on and then re-airs over and over again.
[00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:54.765]  So, I mean, you can probably get 20, 30 people.
[00:35:57.468 --> 00:36:02.571]  I mean, in fact, I think it's safe to give, like, 20 people your username and passcode.
[00:36:02.571 --> 00:36:05.492]  Again, don't have the same username and passcode as we say on the site.
[00:36:05.492 --> 00:36:07.873]  You have for other things, make it a unique one.
[00:36:07.873 --> 00:36:10.114]  And then email it to friends and family.
[00:36:10.114 --> 00:36:11.574]  Say, hey, here's my username and passcode.
[00:36:11.574 --> 00:36:12.955]  You can use it.
[00:36:12.955 --> 00:36:14.575]  They just go enter into the username and passcode.
[00:36:14.575 --> 00:36:15.596]  Boom, they're in.
[00:36:15.596 --> 00:36:20.078]  PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:36:20.078 --> 00:36:20.758]  We'll get them there.
[00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.371]  And this is a really powerful initiative.
[00:36:25.371 --> 00:36:29.193]  If you've already got a membership, share it with other people.
[00:36:29.193 --> 00:36:39.658]  If you want to really support us, go get a couple more memberships and print them up on cards, the username and passcode you create that's simple, and then go give it to people.
[00:36:39.658 --> 00:36:42.539]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:51.323]  And I see that people are using this, people are doing this, and it is very, very exciting to see tons of people tuning in.
[00:36:52.774 --> 00:37:02.198]  When the transmission premieres every single evening at 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[00:37:02.198 --> 00:37:06.560]  And then, of course, there's archives a few hours later in HD.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.382]  You can watch it when you want, how you want, where you want.
[00:37:09.382 --> 00:37:14.764]  And we're just adding more and more features to it all the time, a big redesign of the site.
[00:37:14.764 --> 00:37:18.786]  Okay, getting back into the news, let me just cover some of what's coming up here.
[00:37:20.143 --> 00:37:22.344]  Obama to quickly go for immigration reform.
[00:37:22.344 --> 00:37:24.484]  That means total open borders.
[00:37:24.484 --> 00:37:27.485]  And this is out of the weekly standard.
[00:37:27.485 --> 00:37:29.506]  And gun control.
[00:37:29.506 --> 00:37:36.328]  So... Every time we do the document cam, it's just right here.
[00:37:36.328 --> 00:37:37.509]  This is the spot.
[00:37:37.509 --> 00:37:38.749]  Right here.
[00:37:38.749 --> 00:37:39.449]  It's right here.
[00:37:39.449 --> 00:37:40.950]  We can show the TV viewers.
[00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:41.370]  There you go.
[00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:41.770]  It's right there.
[00:37:42.575 --> 00:37:46.838]  Obama to quickly go for immigration reform and gun control.
[00:37:46.838 --> 00:37:54.384]  White House pledges action this month.
[00:37:54.384 --> 00:37:56.806]  And it just continues to go over all of that.
[00:37:56.806 --> 00:38:01.270]  Draconian Illinois gun ban advances to Senate floor.
[00:38:04.736 --> 00:38:10.599]  Effort to apply Chicago's disastrous gun policy across entire state accelerates.
[00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:11.920]  It hasn't been disastrous.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.441]  It's been a mafia takeover.
[00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:15.042]  It's worked absolutely well.
[00:38:15.042 --> 00:38:16.583]  The drug war is a big success.
[00:38:16.583 --> 00:38:18.264]  Record prison populations.
[00:38:18.264 --> 00:38:21.105]  The country converting to a prison culture.
[00:38:21.105 --> 00:38:23.867]  Largest prison population in world history.
[00:38:28.396 --> 00:38:31.239]  Giant mega banks laundering all the drug money.
[00:38:31.239 --> 00:38:33.360]  The police totally corrupted in many areas.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:40.287]  I mean, it's absolutely worked like a charm.
[00:38:40.287 --> 00:38:48.714]  And continuing here with the news, Deputy Police Chief calls for permanent DWI checkpoint in Texas.
[00:38:48.714 --> 00:38:51.056]  And they're doing this all over the country.
[00:38:51.056 --> 00:38:55.280]  They have these individuals under federal grants
[00:38:57.774 --> 00:39:06.342]  Every day I tune into local radio news and they're going, I think it's the right thing to do to have checkpoints on the highways and just search everyone.
[00:39:06.342 --> 00:39:08.744]  And Clinton called for this and signed an executive order.
[00:39:08.744 --> 00:39:11.006]  But obviously it was unconstitutional so it never got implemented.
[00:39:11.006 --> 00:39:13.589]  And they said we're going to set up hardened checkpoints on the highways.
[00:39:13.989 --> 00:39:15.910]  And we're going to pull everybody over and search them.
[00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:25.555]  So to get everybody ready, up to 100 miles inside the border, they put these up to basically harass citizens and, you know, dig through your car without a warrant, claiming they're Constitution-free zones.
[00:39:25.555 --> 00:39:29.758]  More than half the population lives within 100 miles of a border or a coastline.
[00:39:29.758 --> 00:39:33.820]  I think it's like 70-plus percent if you pull up the numbers.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.322]  So the point here is, is that they're already doing it, though.
[00:39:38.604 --> 00:39:54.266]  And under Clinton, I filmed this and have it in my film, Police Day 2000, you can see I-35 at night backed up 20 miles from Kyle in South Austin, in the suburbs, all the way to Georgetown.
[00:39:55.487 --> 00:40:00.368]  20 miles traffic, three miles an hour, just to see if they could do it.
[00:40:00.368 --> 00:40:08.390]  And people sat there, and if you exited anywhere on the 20 miles, they said that was probable cause to pull you over and search your vehicle on top of it.
[00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:14.992]  I mean, you see 20 miles of traffic, and we went and drove down the country roads, got out to the end of the checkpoint.
[00:40:16.104 --> 00:40:21.649]  Austin Police remember this, and they tried, and then the legislature said that's illegal, don't do it anymore.
[00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:26.514]  And the police now servile minions of the feds, at least the police chiefs.
[00:40:26.514 --> 00:40:30.938]  You've heard it in Arkansas and Oklahoma and California and Michigan.
[00:40:30.938 --> 00:40:41.307]  Marines help run DWI checkpoints, and it's in the newspapers in Californian places, and Marines with 9mm Berettas on their hip.
[00:40:42.654 --> 00:40:46.199]  And having machine guns in the backs of Humvees, aiming them at people.
[00:40:46.199 --> 00:40:57.513]  You know, there's a bank robbery outside Denver, so they shut down, you know, 50-something square miles and dozens of roads and streets and have cops out with M16s aiming them at everybody.
[00:40:59.628 --> 00:41:04.050]  It's just an act of domination, an act of piracy, an act of total control.
[00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:08.732]  And now, all over the country, they're pulling people over with the same glove.
[00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:10.973]  It's totally illegal to search you without a warrant.
[00:41:10.973 --> 00:41:11.413]  They don't care.
[00:41:11.413 --> 00:41:13.514]  They just say, women, get up against the car.
[00:41:13.514 --> 00:41:16.716]  And then they take their hand and go in your body.
[00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:32.346]  They go in men's rectum, they go in women's hind end, they go in the women's sexual organ, and the women get sick, and they get infections, they do it to multiple people, and they go to the doctor, and they just go, shut up!
[00:41:32.346 --> 00:41:33.906]  Shut up and get used to it!
[00:41:33.906 --> 00:41:38.227]  We'll use the same glove, and we're gonna stick our hands in you, and you're gonna take it!
[00:41:41.581 --> 00:41:43.982]  Just amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:43.982 --> 00:41:45.423]  And so here's the article.
[00:41:45.423 --> 00:41:52.806]  Deputy Police Chief, he's been doing this like every day for six months, calls for permanent DWI checkpoints in Texas, hardened points.
[00:41:52.806 --> 00:41:55.127]  And this is what Homeland Security is already announcing.
[00:41:55.127 --> 00:42:00.689]  They bought thousands of these armored pillboxes that are like these armored 18-wheeler trailers, and they just set them up.
[00:42:00.689 --> 00:42:03.070]  They've already done tests in Tennessee and other areas.
[00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:07.472]  We've shown you newscast video, showing some of it now, and they just search it.
[00:42:08.479 --> 00:42:13.303]  And by the way, folks, it's getting to the point, they're hiring cops, where you even lip them.
[00:42:13.303 --> 00:42:15.885]  They just get you out and just go, taser time.
[00:42:15.885 --> 00:42:22.791]  Or they just roundhouse, you know, with a big old punch, break your jaw, charge you with assaulting them, even though it's on video.
[00:42:22.791 --> 00:42:25.814]  You videotape them, they club your head in, take you to jail.
[00:42:25.814 --> 00:42:28.536]  And it's just, they're gonna stomp your guts out, America.
[00:42:28.536 --> 00:42:31.278]  They're gonna take your guns, unless you wake up.
[00:42:31.278 --> 00:42:34.281]  I mean, I'm laying out what's really going on here.
[00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:36.463]  I'm telling you where the end of the road goes, okay?
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:43.602]  I'm telling you where the end of the road goes, okay?
[00:42:43.602 --> 00:42:55.386]  And the state police, for two weeks, when they showed these police just randomly, I'm gonna pull you over, happened to Darren McBreen's girlfriend.
[00:42:55.386 --> 00:42:59.207]  She's driving all the way out of West Texas, you know, to come here and see him.
[00:42:59.207 --> 00:43:04.169]  She's on the same road, cops pull him over, and they go, I saw you not use a turn signal.
[00:43:04.169 --> 00:43:05.950]  And she said, I've been on the same lane
[00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:10.152]  For over a hundred miles, I didn't, he goes, let me just see your eyes.
[00:43:10.152 --> 00:43:14.715]  Uh, this is just a DWI, uh, just to pull, just, just randomly checking.
[00:43:14.715 --> 00:43:15.275]  It's a joke.
[00:43:15.275 --> 00:43:20.278]  I mean, cops pull me over, know who I am and ask if I'm drinking or if I have drugs or guns.
[00:43:20.278 --> 00:43:24.100]  And I just go, number one, I don't use products that your bosses ship in.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.562]  Number two, I'm not dumb enough to be drinking and driving.
[00:43:26.562 --> 00:43:30.865]  And number three.
[00:43:30.865 --> 00:43:32.886]  Oh, I just don't even know what to say anymore.
[00:43:36.263 --> 00:43:41.724]  You know full well that your implying guns are illegal.
[00:43:42.816 --> 00:43:44.037]  It's just, it's gone.
[00:43:44.037 --> 00:43:44.437]  It's gone.
[00:43:44.437 --> 00:43:46.099]  We have the biggest prison population.
[00:43:46.099 --> 00:43:47.260]  We have the highest cancer rate.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.301]  They're killing us.
[00:43:48.301 --> 00:43:49.301]  We're being killed, okay?
[00:43:49.301 --> 00:43:57.709]  And I've got all their White House Science Czar book, Ecoscience, where they talk about how they kill us with cancer and kill us with stuff in the water.
[00:43:57.709 --> 00:44:00.171]  I mean, it just sterilizes.
[00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:09.779]  Our sperm counts down 87 to 89 percent, and the women are dying, and highest rate of breast cancer in the world, and our kids are the most brain damaged in the world from all the shots.
[00:44:11.713 --> 00:44:12.974]  And I'm a bad guy.
[00:44:12.974 --> 00:44:15.056]  I'm a mad dog for being upset about it.
[00:44:15.056 --> 00:44:17.418]  Let me continue here.
[00:44:17.418 --> 00:44:20.200]  A deputy police chief in South Texas.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.342]  South Texas is the second biggest city in Texas.
[00:44:22.342 --> 00:44:23.683]  What is it, like 5 million people?
[00:44:23.683 --> 00:44:27.626]  Wants to set up permanent DWI checkpoints in order to save lives.
[00:44:27.626 --> 00:44:28.868]  Well, that's... I mean...
[00:44:30.222 --> 00:44:31.382]  How do I put cameras in our house?
[00:44:31.382 --> 00:44:32.983]  Oh, they're already proposing that in Houston.
[00:44:32.983 --> 00:44:33.863]  It would save lives.
[00:44:33.863 --> 00:44:41.366]  Raising the possibility that Texans would be forced to show their papers, submit to breathalyzer tests, and even mandated to have blood drawn whenever they drive down the street.
[00:44:41.366 --> 00:44:51.429]  Yeah, they're now in... The feds started this 15 years ago in Phoenix, and now they've done it everywhere, and first they go, well, it's a holiday, no refusal to take blood.
[00:44:51.429 --> 00:44:57.371]  Listen, one of my graphics crew was out
[00:44:59.451 --> 00:45:02.592]  And I happen to know she doesn't even drink.
[00:45:02.592 --> 00:45:12.316]  And they're out before New Year's, it was after Christmas, and they're driving home and she's a designated driver going out to eat.
[00:45:12.316 --> 00:45:16.857]  And they get them out and they go, we're arresting you all, we can smell alcohol.
[00:45:16.857 --> 00:45:19.478]  And they go, well, I haven't been drinking, I'm a designated driver.
[00:45:19.478 --> 00:45:21.779]  They said, we'll do a bunch of sobriety tests.
[00:45:21.779 --> 00:45:24.560]  And she did one and said, look, I've not been drinking, I told you.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.281]  They said, that's it, you're DWI too.
[00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:29.032]  They want to stick needles in you.
[00:45:29.032 --> 00:45:32.017]  And I'm going to get to the forced inoculations in a moment.
[00:45:32.017 --> 00:45:32.839]  And it goes on.
[00:45:32.839 --> 00:45:39.711]  San Antonio Deputy Police Chief Antonio Trevino appeared Monday in Austin before the Texas House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee.
[00:45:41.172 --> 00:45:52.081]  The San Antonio Express News reports he urged legislators to allow law officers to stop drivers and do routine sobriety tests near so-called drinking and driving hotspots, which is just everywhere.
[00:45:52.081 --> 00:45:53.683]  Again, they let you go drink in the bars.
[00:45:53.683 --> 00:45:55.144]  Humans have always done it.
[00:45:55.144 --> 00:45:58.427]  Texting and driving is five times more dangerous than MIT studies.
[00:45:58.427 --> 00:46:00.068]  That isn't what matters.
[00:46:00.068 --> 00:46:02.750]  It's all about getting you into the system.
[00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.192]  But if you're an illegal alien, they let you go.
[00:46:05.192 --> 00:46:09.036]  He says local data could be used to identify areas where such behavior is
[00:46:10.919 --> 00:46:11.319]  Prevalent.
[00:46:11.319 --> 00:46:12.480]  Okay, let me explain to you.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.200]  They're already doing these illegally.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.521]  Here's the next story.
[00:46:15.521 --> 00:46:19.042]  Steve Watson, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:24.885]  Texas cops cite gangs as justification for unconstitutional checkpoints.
[00:46:24.885 --> 00:46:38.070]  They set up highway checkpoints across South Texas and then just search your car, they admit it in the articles in the McAllen Monitor, and make you take your shirt off on the side of the road and take photos of your tattoos.
[00:46:41.004 --> 00:46:49.628]  And then the argument is, well, it's the Mexican drug gangs that our government trained and shipped guns to, and launders the drug money for, Wachovia, Wells Fargo, on record.
[00:46:49.628 --> 00:46:50.988]  I mean, it's all a joke!
[00:46:50.988 --> 00:46:59.172]  You made the drugs illegal, just like they made alcohol illegal, because you're criminals, because you want a cut of it, and you've destroyed Mexico, and now they're going to declare martial law.
[00:46:59.172 --> 00:47:04.074]  I had a state senator on two years ago who said they've already declared martial law on the border.
[00:47:04.074 --> 00:47:08.216]  Now it's coming all the way up to San Antonio, almost 200 miles from the border.
[00:47:09.471 --> 00:47:16.813]  I mean, I've seen border patrol vehicles pulling people over in Austin, and it's citizens!
[00:47:16.813 --> 00:47:26.716]  I've talked to people who've had TSA, we've even got photos of it, big black armored vehicles that say TSA, and they'll come up and roust women in a parking lot and ask them what they're doing.
[00:47:26.716 --> 00:47:29.617]  I mean, it's just a bunch of goons like North Korea!
[00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:37.831]  And they go on to break down how they're doing it, and that's out of the McAllen Monitor.
[00:47:37.831 --> 00:47:41.593]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is just unbelievable.
[00:47:41.593 --> 00:47:47.497]  Now, let me move along to this report right here.
[00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.458]  Nurses fired for refusing shot.
[00:47:49.458 --> 00:47:52.860]  KTXS.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.021]  This is all over the country.
[00:47:54.021 --> 00:47:57.723]  Hospital employees had filed appeals citing religious reasons.
[00:47:57.723 --> 00:48:02.846]  Six nurses and other employees at a hospital in Indiana are out of jobs for refusing a flu shot.
[00:48:04.016 --> 00:48:05.297]  I just feel like it's a toxin.
[00:48:05.297 --> 00:48:06.218]  Well, it says it on the insert.
[00:48:06.218 --> 00:48:07.579]  It can kill you.
[00:48:07.579 --> 00:48:10.000]  And I don't want it in my body, she told the station.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.042]  There are side effects.
[00:48:12.042 --> 00:48:12.902]  Says that in the insert.
[00:48:12.902 --> 00:48:13.703]  I can show you.
[00:48:13.703 --> 00:48:15.264]  CDC saying it can kill you.
[00:48:15.264 --> 00:48:17.926]  There are no guarantees that it's even going to protect you.
[00:48:17.926 --> 00:48:23.030]  The flu shot has never been guessed a year early of what it's actually going to be.
[00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:26.372]  And it lowers your immunity by 50% each time you take it and gives you Alzheimer's.
[00:48:26.372 --> 00:48:28.033]  But that's mainline studies.
[00:48:28.033 --> 00:48:29.915]  Now let me tell you the story.
[00:48:29.915 --> 00:48:30.195]  Okay?
[00:48:31.616 --> 00:48:40.960]  And we're not ready to give out the info yet, because we want to not play that card right now, because I'm probably going to help him litigate.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:48.643]  One of my crew members' wife had a two-pound, six-ounce baby last week.
[00:48:48.643 --> 00:48:49.983]  The baby has brain swelling.
[00:48:49.983 --> 00:48:56.666]  The baby has blood going, because 300 heart beats per minute out of its ventricles into the lungs.
[00:48:56.666 --> 00:48:59.767]  The baby is in critical condition.
[00:48:59.767 --> 00:49:00.968]  What's going on at the hospital?
[00:49:02.287 --> 00:49:04.648]  And I warned him too, because it's a city-affiliated one.
[00:49:04.648 --> 00:49:07.790]  I said, don't go near your life.
[00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:13.434]  You've got to go where rich people go, if you're going to go to a hospital, because they don't feed on them yet.
[00:49:13.434 --> 00:49:17.396]  If you go to a big mainline mega-hospital, folks, they see you as an animal.
[00:49:17.396 --> 00:49:25.802]  You better show up in diamond rings and top hats, because you have a birth plan or whatever, you say on there, no vaccines.
[00:49:27.386 --> 00:49:31.771]  The nurses try to pressure you to do it, and you go, I know there's no law, stop saying there is.
[00:49:31.771 --> 00:49:39.739]  They're in there telling them, we're not going to give you your baby, and we're going to take your baby, which is in a lot of trouble.
[00:49:39.739 --> 00:49:41.500]  I want you to pray for the baby girl.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.824]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:49:44.824 --> 00:49:46.826]  This is a great guy and great lady.
[00:49:46.826 --> 00:49:47.627]  Friends of mine.
[00:49:47.627 --> 00:49:48.628]  Just really good people.
[00:49:50.573 --> 00:49:56.639]  And they are in there day one going, you as parents must take the shots or you can't have your kid.
[00:49:56.639 --> 00:49:58.581]  Hepatitis, flu, you name it.
[00:49:58.581 --> 00:50:00.663]  No law, but they're telling them it is.
[00:50:00.663 --> 00:50:02.045]  You understand how criminal that is?
[00:50:02.045 --> 00:50:05.889]  But they just do it because they're backed up by the police and their ignorance and their evil.
[00:50:08.092 --> 00:50:22.045]  And they're in there saying basically that, well, I'm going to break it down after break, but you remember just four years ago, everybody knew you don't give a pregnant woman a vaccine because the insert says it can cause a miscarriage or brain damage to the child.
[00:50:22.045 --> 00:50:25.288]  And it's just well known for decades.
[00:50:26.664 --> 00:50:35.229]  I got crew here who have wives who are nurses, where they're pregnant, and the hospital's like, okay, you don't have to take the shot, because you're pregnant.
[00:50:35.229 --> 00:50:36.910]  Because the doctors still know that.
[00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:42.853]  But now they've come out in the news and said, no, if you're pregnant, you need extra shots.
[00:50:42.853 --> 00:50:45.935]  Folks, they want to just see if they can kill us right out in the open.
[00:50:45.935 --> 00:50:47.435]  And they're there.
[00:50:47.435 --> 00:50:53.679]  Imagine when a mother is in these desperate straits, they forced her to take the shots.
[00:50:54.924 --> 00:50:57.750]  Outside of law, saying we'll take your baby.
[00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:58.853]  It's unbelievable.
[00:51:00.911 --> 00:51:06.656]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older one gets.
[00:51:06.656 --> 00:51:16.244]  The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.

[00:54:12.881 --> 00:54:21.747]  Let me break down how evil, how criminal, how wicked the TSA, the hospital workers, the police, the whole system.
[00:54:21.747 --> 00:54:26.970]  They gang up like gangs and say, we're going to drag you off in a room and stick our hands down your pants.
[00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:30.112]  We're the state police and we'll show some video of that for TV viewers.
[00:54:30.112 --> 00:54:33.674]  We're going to pull women over and we're going to get these good looking women out.
[00:54:33.674 --> 00:54:35.996]  That's why this was, you know, it's always the same.
[00:54:35.996 --> 00:54:37.717]  And we're going to take the same glove.
[00:54:38.277 --> 00:54:40.498]  And we're gonna stick it inside your body.
[00:54:40.498 --> 00:54:42.380]  That's America, folks.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:52.986]  And the sycophantic fetish of worshipping government is so incredible that people are like, it's the right thing to do, it's for our safety.
[00:54:52.986 --> 00:54:56.869]  And they're showing the video now, and they go to the next woman, it's even more incredible.
[00:54:56.869 --> 00:55:00.351]  They're like, same glove, it's on record, here they go.
[00:55:00.351 --> 00:55:01.892]  That's on top of all this now.
[00:55:03.496 --> 00:55:05.976]  Now, let's expand on this.
[00:55:05.976 --> 00:55:29.080]  One of my crew members, probably the sweetest person that works up here, in fact, no doubt the sweetest person that works up here, they're so excited about having a baby, and of course the system pushed to have ultrasounds over and over again, and I was like warning them, that it's study show that causes this.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.121]  But the point is, that goes on, there's a medical mafia,
[00:55:33.305 --> 00:55:40.529]  And then they're in there for like a week now and they come in and they go, you know, you're not going to get your baby unless you take shots.
[00:55:40.529 --> 00:55:42.369]  And this is somebody that works here and is smart.
[00:55:42.369 --> 00:55:43.950]  And they go, there's no law.
[00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.592]  They're like, yeah, there is.
[00:55:46.592 --> 00:55:47.652]  Well, show me the insert.
[00:55:47.652 --> 00:55:48.913]  There is no insert.
[00:55:48.913 --> 00:55:50.253]  Well, I want the one without mercury.
[00:55:50.253 --> 00:55:51.134]  Just see what they go.
[00:55:51.134 --> 00:55:52.635]  There, there is no mercury.
[00:55:52.635 --> 00:55:55.056]  It's all just, you're like, well, yes, there is.
[00:55:55.056 --> 00:55:57.177]  It's all just savage lying.
[00:55:59.215 --> 00:56:01.396]  It's just, and it's called gaslighting.
[00:56:01.396 --> 00:56:05.897]  That's one term used in psychology.
[00:56:05.897 --> 00:56:10.759]  And it made me physically ill when he was up here with tears in his eyes yesterday.
[00:56:10.759 --> 00:56:17.782]  And I just said, go in there, record it, and we'll save a lot of people's children when we put all this out.
[00:56:17.782 --> 00:56:24.164]  I said, record it, get them to all say it again, record it on your iPhone, and we'll get them.
[00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.751]  You gotta get aggressive with these people, okay?
[00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:30.552]  They will tell parents, oh, it's the law, your kids gotta take vaccines.
[00:56:30.552 --> 00:56:35.774]  They shoot them up from Alabama to California now without parental consent.
[00:56:35.774 --> 00:56:47.479]  And when people sued in California, they got the legislature to pass a law to shoot your kids up and not even tell you, saying the state is the parent.
[00:56:47.479 --> 00:56:48.499]  I mean, that's crook.
[00:56:48.499 --> 00:56:51.520]  They're like, well, we got a law to do it.
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.261]  Really, you got a law to do it, huh?
[00:56:54.943 --> 00:56:56.264]  Your law is a tyranny.
[00:56:56.264 --> 00:56:57.945]  Your law is a fraud.
[00:56:57.945 --> 00:57:01.047]  And I've got all the Supreme Court cases, but everybody knows that.
[00:57:01.047 --> 00:57:08.832]  I mean, these people are a cult of yes-men, and these megacorporations that are eugenicists, they go out and they hire people!
[00:57:11.135 --> 00:57:12.535]  Who will do what they're told?
[00:57:12.535 --> 00:57:16.536]  They give you psychological profiles now to get a job at McDonald's.
[00:57:16.536 --> 00:57:21.298]  And those profiles, on record, are set to make sure you'll go along with it.
[00:57:21.298 --> 00:57:30.580]  Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse in which false information is presented with the intent of making a victim doubt his or her own memory, perception, and sanity.
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.521]  That's where they go.
[00:57:31.521 --> 00:57:35.482]  They'll say, you have to take the shots as mommy and daddy.
[00:57:35.482 --> 00:57:36.402]  And so does the baby.
[00:57:37.449 --> 00:57:50.015]  instances may range simply from the denial by an abuser that previous abuse incidents have occurred, up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim.
[00:57:50.015 --> 00:57:55.297]  And see, the globalist brag, Cass Sunstein at the White House says, they want to disorient us.
[00:57:55.297 --> 00:57:58.979]  All this is like, our bill says we're going to take your guns, but we're not going to.
[00:57:58.979 --> 00:58:02.621]  Oh, we're building the Trans-Texas Corridor, but it doesn't exist.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:09.307]  And they play these mind games with people, and that's why people are disoriented.
[00:58:09.307 --> 00:58:11.250]  And you watch cartoons on TV.
[00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:15.096]  It's all meant to disorient... That's why cartoons don't make sense and are all disjointed.
[00:58:15.096 --> 00:58:16.819]  It's meant... It's on major studies.
[00:58:16.819 --> 00:58:18.942]  The kids' brains are already wired wrong.
[00:58:18.942 --> 00:58:19.823]  They're brain damaged.
[00:58:20.444 --> 00:58:22.384]  The general public's in a trance, folks!
[00:58:22.384 --> 00:58:33.927]  They've got military control-grade systems that have been proven in torture camps by the Chinese, the Communist Russians, the Nazis, and our government, and they're using it on you!
[00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:43.168]  Do you wanna- The police are pulling you over, putting their hands up your rear end!
[00:58:43.168 --> 00:58:47.129]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:53.484 --> 00:59:55.885]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.885 --> 01:00:05.251]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.251 --> 01:00:06.551]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.551 --> 01:00:08.332]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.332 --> 01:00:10.093]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.093 --> 01:00:11.674]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:13.215]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.215 --> 01:00:17.417]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.417 --> 01:00:21.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.493 --> 01:00:32.680]  If you just joined us, it makes me physically ill because I empathize.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.441]  I mean, I've told the story of little geckos.
[01:00:34.441 --> 01:00:36.923]  It happens a couple times a year because there's so many of them.
[01:00:36.923 --> 01:00:45.128]  I can sit there with binoculars and watch them out on the post out up by the road.
[01:00:45.128 --> 01:00:45.929]  I live out in the country.
[01:00:45.929 --> 01:00:52.333]  I can watch these geckos hunt like tigers or lions sitting there by the light coming out and eating mosquitoes.
[01:00:53.385 --> 01:01:21.675]  little fat pink things a little lizards and skanks and others some of them are like a foot and a half long some of these lizards it's like wild kingdom out in the texas hill country and and and undoubtedly a couple times a year especially when it gets cold they come in the house and i i'll be in the bathroom at night and i feel a crunch and i turn the light on there's a little smash gecko you know his guts and brain smashed out and it hurts because
[01:01:22.893 --> 01:01:28.316]  It's a pointless death, and it's a cute little creature, and I empathize with it because I love life.
[01:01:28.316 --> 01:01:30.298]  Now, I have proper instincts.
[01:01:30.298 --> 01:01:34.700]  I understand to go out and shoot a deer that's a prey animal, butcher it, and then eat it.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.781]  That is a natural progression.
[01:01:36.781 --> 01:01:41.124]  If you don't, you get overpopulations of them, and they're running out in front of cars everywhere and starving to death.
[01:01:41.124 --> 01:01:42.325]  This is just happening in Austin.
[01:01:43.868 --> 01:01:44.909]  You're like, where is this going?
[01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:49.312]  What are you talking about before Dr. Corsi comes on to get into the trans-Texas corridor or the attack on the Second Amendment?
[01:01:49.312 --> 01:01:55.417]  Just unprecedented stuff happening, but we have a normalcy bias, even I do now, to just accept it.
[01:01:55.417 --> 01:02:00.040]  Warrantless checkpoints where they stick their hands inside your body, it's all being set up.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.844]  And the cops pull you over and just laugh at you because they're in the uniform, they're in the car, they got the power.
[01:02:04.844 --> 01:02:07.546]  Doesn't matter, they've already been implanted with cancer viruses and the flu shot.
[01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:12.834]  It doesn't matter if they're going to be 10-15 years dead of cancer, 45 years old.
[01:02:12.834 --> 01:02:17.319]  They'll never even know what hit them.
[01:02:17.319 --> 01:02:25.807]  It's sad when you're looking at one of these zombies, because they're just victims, but you can't get through to them.
[01:02:25.807 --> 01:02:27.329]  You can't get through.
[01:02:27.329 --> 01:02:28.790]  You're not going to get through to the zombies.
[01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:33.943]  5% of our forebearers said no to the corruption and won.
[01:02:33.943 --> 01:02:36.707]  And there's way more than 5% of us really get what's going on.
[01:02:36.707 --> 01:02:41.873]  But I want to say something to mainline conservatives here.
[01:02:41.873 --> 01:02:43.435]  It's time for you.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:56.822]  To realize that the left isn't the left and the left isn't, you know, environmental wackos or stupid or they don't know what they're doing.
[01:02:56.822 --> 01:02:59.523]  They know taking guns makes crime go up.
[01:02:59.523 --> 01:03:01.823]  They want to make you their slave.
[01:03:01.823 --> 01:03:11.485]  And the reason I got off into empathy is that when I know somebody and their baby is in critical condition fighting for their life,
[01:03:12.603 --> 01:03:22.356]  And the nurses are there bullying them and telling the young mother, oh yeah, you know, you gotta take the shot or you don't get to have the baby.
[01:03:22.356 --> 01:03:24.158]  We'll take the baby.
[01:03:24.158 --> 01:03:29.726]  That's like saying, coming to somebody's door and saying, buy life insurance from me or I'm gonna kidnap your kid.
[01:03:30.503 --> 01:03:31.924]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:03:31.924 --> 01:03:34.725]  But it's, oh, you're in a nurse uniform.
[01:03:34.725 --> 01:03:39.207]  You're, oh, well, I better do what you say, because the nurses have been forced to take it.
[01:03:39.207 --> 01:03:45.209]  They're going to now abuse you and force you to do it outside of law.
[01:03:45.209 --> 01:03:56.854]  Assaulting you with a deadly weapon, proven to be hurting people.
[01:03:56.854 --> 01:03:57.394]  It's amazing.
[01:03:59.122 --> 01:04:01.830]  And they sit there with gas lighting.
[01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:03.254]  And I'm telling you, gas lighting...
[01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:21.172]  Is a term used since the thirties, and there's other clinical names for it, and it's in psychological warfare manuals that are declassified that I've gone and read, and training films that you can look on YouTube, Army Training Psy-Op Manuals, of how when they would take over a third world country, how they'd control people and round them up.
[01:04:21.172 --> 01:04:22.873]  Oh, our military's done that.
[01:04:22.873 --> 01:04:33.637]  You go watch those psychological warfare videos, just type that in, Army Psychological Warfare Videos, and you'll see them from the fifties and stuff, and it's what they're setting up with the checkpoints and the tattletales and all this.
[01:04:35.236 --> 01:04:43.220]  They'll come to you and you're like, you know, you just used the same glove to go in my hind end and then in theirs.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.781]  And they'll go, there's no glove.
[01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:50.704]  And you're like, what do you mean there's no glove?
[01:04:50.704 --> 01:04:52.925]  It's a psych warfare technique.
[01:04:52.925 --> 01:04:54.546]  There's no trans-Texas corridor.
[01:04:54.546 --> 01:04:56.167]  Israelis don't own guns.
[01:05:00.578 --> 01:05:06.060]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.480]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:17.563]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:17.563 --> 01:05:21.024]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:05:21.024 --> 01:05:22.704]  There's no priming required.
[01:05:22.704 --> 01:05:24.985]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[01:05:24.985 --> 01:05:27.486]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:05:28.626 --> 01:05:30.067]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:05:30.067 --> 01:05:31.487]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:05:31.487 --> 01:05:34.669]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:38.050]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:42.192]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:05:42.192 --> 01:05:44.913]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:05:44.913 --> 01:05:46.494]  It's what my family uses.
[01:05:46.494 --> 01:05:49.815]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:05:49.815 --> 01:05:55.058]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:01.642]  888-253-3139.
[01:06:01.642 --> 01:06:07.245]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:06:07.245 --> 01:06:10.467]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.288]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:06:13.288 --> 01:06:16.310]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:19.832]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:06:19.832 --> 01:06:24.415]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from Eat Foods Direct, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:06:25.015 --> 01:06:27.676]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:06:27.676 --> 01:06:31.337]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:06:31.337 --> 01:06:33.458]  I'm taking control of my future.
[01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:35.118]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[01:06:35.118 --> 01:06:39.019]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[01:06:39.019 --> 01:06:43.441]  And you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under 50 bucks.

[01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:47.722]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:54.386 --> 01:07:03.075]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:07:03.075 --> 01:07:08.100]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:15.267]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:07:15.387 --> 01:07:21.032]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:07:21.032 --> 01:07:25.056]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:07:25.056 --> 01:07:29.780]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:35.005]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:07:35.245 --> 01:07:38.487]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:40.988]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:07:40.988 --> 01:07:45.751]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:07:45.751 --> 01:07:48.632]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:55.836]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:07:55.836 --> 01:07:57.117]  We're getting prepared.
[01:07:57.117 --> 01:07:57.777]  Are you?
[01:07:57.777 --> 01:07:58.557]  Infowarshop.com
[01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:10.232]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.232 --> 01:08:11.812]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.812 --> 01:08:13.353]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.353 --> 01:08:17.554]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.554 --> 01:08:21.616]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:41.293]  My friends, we are in extremely dark times.
[01:08:41.293 --> 01:08:44.577]  The darkest of my 17 years on air.
[01:08:44.577 --> 01:08:48.080]  And unfortunately, our worst analysis is coming true.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.103]  The worst case scenario is now unfolding.
[01:08:51.103 --> 01:08:54.046]  You can probably tell I'm a lot more serious and focused on air.
[01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:54.927]  I'm a lot more angry.
[01:08:56.858 --> 01:09:00.881]  And it's because the globalists are hammered down.
[01:09:00.881 --> 01:09:03.423]  They are going for broke right now.
[01:09:03.423 --> 01:09:11.169]  As the Big Jim Brzezinski has said in two Council on Foreign Relations speeches, also another one in Poland, and in his new book that I read a few months ago.
[01:09:11.169 --> 01:09:12.670]  The globalists are in trouble.
[01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:14.051]  Worldwide there's an awakening.
[01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:25.649]  And so they are going to try to artificially trigger revolutions and put radical Muslims in charge to destabilize the whole world and then use that threat to take our liberties.
[01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:28.932]  It's the old British game of divide and conquer.
[01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:31.615]  Expanding on that, it is in the Illinois Senate.
[01:09:31.615 --> 01:09:34.217]  The NRA says it looks like it may pass.
[01:09:35.325 --> 01:09:39.268]  The article is up at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:39.268 --> 01:09:48.355]  It is a physical gun ban of all semi-automatics, revolvers, handguns, you name it.
[01:09:48.355 --> 01:09:59.103]  In fact, we'll punch up InfoWars.com for viewers and people can actually see that article if they're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:59.103 --> 01:10:02.066]  But gun ban bill advances to Senate floor.
[01:10:03.689 --> 01:10:09.980]  Now notice they use the psychological warfare program of saying, we never want your guns, we don't want to make you turn them in.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:10.941]  That's preposterous.
[01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:13.566]  I've played Joe Biden saying it's ridiculous.
[01:10:13.566 --> 01:10:15.148]  Nobody's going to try to take your handguns.
[01:10:16.192 --> 01:10:18.033]  Nobody's going to try to take your shotgun.
[01:10:18.033 --> 01:10:28.581]  When he authored an even stronger assault weapons ban that called for them to physically be turned in, that Dianne Feinstein originally turned in, that made you physically turn in all semi-autos.
[01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:35.686]  And we played the clip of her saying, I tried to get a bill where Mr. and Mrs. America have to turn in their guns.
[01:10:35.686 --> 01:10:40.189]  I'll play that clip later, but if you're a new listener, it was all over the news last week.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.002]  But then they play this game of, we're not doing that.
[01:10:44.002 --> 01:10:45.383]  We're not doing that.
[01:10:45.383 --> 01:10:46.043]  We're not doing that.
[01:10:46.043 --> 01:10:55.311]  And now Feinstein's introduced her bill that even mainline gun groups are going, oh, it makes you go in with your legally bought guns, and then you go into the ATF, and then they decide if you can keep them.
[01:10:55.311 --> 01:10:56.272]  It's registration.
[01:10:56.272 --> 01:11:04.839]  No, the bill actually says that and a forced buyback, and she's in the New York Times with Cuomo saying, we're going to make you turn them in.
[01:11:06.075 --> 01:11:17.079]  And now in Illinois, the area that this mafia controls, Rahm Emanuel and others, we're on the radio in Chicago right now fighting a lot of good people up there, exposing it.
[01:11:17.079 --> 01:11:26.402]  They're saying, oh yeah, all state holders of guns, handguns, rifles, revolvers, pump shotguns and pump rifles.
[01:11:26.402 --> 01:11:30.223]  I saw somebody on Infowars.com comment and go, there's such a thing as pump rifles?
[01:11:30.223 --> 01:11:33.884]  Yeah, you didn't know there were a lot of pump rifles?
[01:11:33.884 --> 01:11:35.525]  Actually, some pretty good firearms out there.
[01:11:37.802 --> 01:11:39.724]  Lever action, you name it.
[01:11:39.724 --> 01:11:44.349]  They basically are banning everything but bolt action and single shot.
[01:11:44.349 --> 01:11:47.432]  And they've got the FOID registration.
[01:11:47.432 --> 01:11:50.995]  They always use registration to then confiscate.
[01:11:50.995 --> 01:11:57.201]  And they want the Chicago model of a total gun ban for citizens, which is made at the murder capital of the world.
[01:11:57.201 --> 01:11:57.862]  500 deaths last year.
[01:11:57.862 --> 01:11:58.803]  512, they said.
[01:12:02.096 --> 01:12:03.857]  And most of it's gang related.
[01:12:03.857 --> 01:12:07.460]  The point is, this is the days of Al Capone, it's gangs killing each other.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.941]  Citizens have a right to defend themselves.
[01:12:09.941 --> 01:12:12.043]  And a lot of those deaths were citizens defending themselves.
[01:12:13.772 --> 01:12:17.114]  Dr. Jerome Coors is going to join us for the Balance of the Hour, and I appreciate him coming on.
[01:12:17.114 --> 01:12:17.934]  We're going to get into this.
[01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:23.297]  We're going to get into his article, where Perry is still doing public-private partnerships.
[01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:25.639]  Trans-Texas, Napa Superhighway, in pieces.
[01:12:25.639 --> 01:12:30.582]  And people say, I was on ManCal yesterday, and he said, well, why is it important if it's in Texas?
[01:12:30.582 --> 01:12:31.862]  He was asking a rhetorical question.
[01:12:31.862 --> 01:12:32.282]  He knew why.
[01:12:32.282 --> 01:12:33.123]  He's a really smart guy.
[01:12:33.123 --> 01:12:35.064]  Eric Muller.
[01:12:35.064 --> 01:12:41.488]  And I said, Eric, there's 40-plus major interstate highways, another 40 other corollary roads.
[01:12:42.495 --> 01:12:50.782]  That they, in the official Department of Transportation documents, said they want to take over, put taxes on, and fund the North American Union with.
[01:12:50.782 --> 01:12:58.949]  And it's an artery right down to the Pacific side of Mexico, with the biggest port now in the hemisphere, to bring in Chinese goods.
[01:12:59.983 --> 01:13:03.326]  And it's an international corridor, like the Romans used roads to control things.
[01:13:03.326 --> 01:13:07.090]  And I made the film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, almost three hours long.
[01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:09.012]  About 30 minutes of it is on this subject.
[01:13:09.012 --> 01:13:14.997]  And it shows Bush giving speeches saying, we've merged the North American Union with the EU, all the agreements.
[01:13:14.997 --> 01:13:18.440]  I mean, we're already way down the hole here.
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.822]  So all of that's going on.
[01:13:19.822 --> 01:13:21.243]  And that's what this is about.
[01:13:21.243 --> 01:13:23.065]  We're already under a North American Union.
[01:13:24.187 --> 01:13:27.130]  But the states twice voted it down.
[01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:30.853]  Texas is the main funding artery to fund it all the way up into Canada.
[01:13:30.853 --> 01:13:32.914]  They've got mile markers all the way to Canada.
[01:13:32.914 --> 01:13:37.938]  It's marked for mile markers all the way for something like 2,000 miles.
[01:13:37.938 --> 01:13:44.304]  But they just call it the I-35 shoot-around outside Austin.
[01:13:46.158 --> 01:13:47.899]  But it goes all the way to San Antonio.
[01:13:47.899 --> 01:13:49.060]  It's there!
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:54.205]  And CNN, I've played the club, you've seen it, would say Ron Paul four years ago is insane.
[01:13:54.205 --> 01:13:58.628]  There is no Texas Superhighway, there is no Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:13:58.628 --> 01:14:05.354]  We had billboards all over the state with a cowboy going, I like the Trans-Texas Corridor, and paying tolls.
[01:14:05.354 --> 01:14:08.517]  And they had ads going, yeah, it's Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:14:08.517 --> 01:14:11.219]  Texas is proud to be part of the MAP Superhighway system.
[01:14:11.579 --> 01:14:17.781]  I'd go to movies and see ads before the movies going, Texas a proud part of the North American Union.
[01:14:17.781 --> 01:14:19.322]  I appreciate all you're doing.
[01:14:19.322 --> 01:14:20.963]  Meanwhile, we go, hey, we don't want this.
[01:14:20.963 --> 01:14:21.943]  It doesn't exist.
[01:14:21.943 --> 01:14:25.845]  And that's a psychological warfare term called gaslighting.
[01:14:25.845 --> 01:14:31.587]  It's a form of psychological abuse in which false information is presented with the intent of making a victim.
[01:14:32.563 --> 01:14:35.765]  Doubt his or her own memory, perception, and sanity.
[01:14:35.765 --> 01:14:47.894]  Instances may range simply from the denial by an abuser that previous abuse incidents ever occurred, or even the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim.
[01:14:47.894 --> 01:14:51.296]  That's why they'll have school drills unannounced, where they aim guns at kids.
[01:14:51.296 --> 01:14:53.838]  It happened to my crew, who's got kids in public school.
[01:14:53.838 --> 01:14:56.579]  They come and bang on the elementary and say, we're here to kill you!
[01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:58.481]  And the kids all cry and get scared.
[01:14:58.481 --> 01:14:59.662]  And they go, the teachers go,
[01:15:00.342 --> 01:15:01.583]  You know, following a manual.
[01:15:01.583 --> 01:15:03.085]  We're sorry we had to do this.
[01:15:03.085 --> 01:15:04.906]  It's because of American gun owners.
[01:15:04.906 --> 01:15:08.289]  In one manual in Michigan, the Fed issued, it was, we're sorry to do this.
[01:15:08.289 --> 01:15:11.712]  This was due to homeschoolers and people against public education.
[01:15:11.712 --> 01:15:12.413]  That's AP.
[01:15:12.413 --> 01:15:19.059]  If you think I'm joking, they go, sorry, we just blew up a car in the front parking lot and came and said we were going to kill you.
[01:15:19.059 --> 01:15:21.221]  And children literally urinate on themselves.
[01:15:21.221 --> 01:15:23.243]  Teachers have had to go to funny farms over it.
[01:15:23.963 --> 01:15:30.006]  Literally, this has been in the news, have breakdowns where they march people out saying they're going to kill them and mask and don't tell them it's a drill.
[01:15:30.006 --> 01:15:31.127]  That was in Minneapolis, St.
[01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:31.687]  Paul.
[01:15:31.687 --> 01:15:33.047]  Okay, I'm ranting, we'll go to our guests.
[01:15:33.047 --> 01:15:37.550]  I just want to introduce this because some stations just joined us in this hour.
[01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:44.013]  That it is a psychological warfare program and the police are being brainwashed too to just accept this.
[01:15:44.013 --> 01:15:48.075]  Now they're announcing checkpoints all over the country to stop gangs and look for illegal guns.
[01:15:49.284 --> 01:15:53.108]  The hammer's being dropped, and Dr. Corsi can break this down.
[01:15:53.108 --> 01:15:56.871]  He, of course, has worked with the State Department of National Security in classified areas.
[01:15:56.871 --> 01:15:59.434]  He has a Harvard PhD in political science.
[01:15:59.434 --> 01:16:04.318]  He's worked for, you know, Fortune, you know, top megabanks, you name it.
[01:16:04.318 --> 01:16:06.060]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:09.203]  He's, I don't know, three or four number one New York Times bestsellers.
[01:16:10.564 --> 01:16:12.104]  This is the total takeover.
[01:16:12.104 --> 01:16:17.625]  And the Republicans, you notice, $1 of cuts for every $41 in tax increases.
[01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:20.206]  77% of Americans, massive tax increases.
[01:16:20.206 --> 01:16:21.686]  Obama lying about that.
[01:16:21.686 --> 01:16:24.607]  They're announcing total open borders, total legalization.
[01:16:24.607 --> 01:16:26.767]  They're going for our guns everywhere.
[01:16:26.767 --> 01:16:27.367]  It's on.
[01:16:27.367 --> 01:16:28.667]  Checkpoints, everything.
[01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:30.908]  Dr. Corsi, how bad is it?
[01:16:30.908 --> 01:16:32.268]  It's even worse than I thought it would be.
[01:16:32.268 --> 01:16:33.148]  What is your take?
[01:16:33.148 --> 01:16:34.568]  Why is it moving so quickly?
[01:16:34.568 --> 01:16:38.009]  I mean, it is like the dam has broken.
[01:16:38.823 --> 01:16:42.186]  Well, I think it's a good rush to the finish line.
[01:16:42.186 --> 01:16:45.349]  I think the new world order sees an opportunity.
[01:16:45.349 --> 01:16:57.499]  With the article I wrote in the World Net Daily, WND, just over the holidays, it's clear that Governor Perry, with the Trans-Texas Corridor, that it's back.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:12.304]  I mean, I researched it and found that now there's something like $20 billion in road work underway throughout Texas on these public-private partnerships.
[01:17:12.304 --> 01:17:15.445]  That's the key idea, the public-private partnership.
[01:17:17.285 --> 01:17:33.286]  And typically, three of these deals I looked at in particular, State Highway 130 near San Antonio, extensions of I-35 around Dallas-Fort Worth, CINTRA in Spain.
[01:17:35.248 --> 01:17:40.730]  Which was the company that was going to do the full development of the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:48.873]  The 4,000 miles that Governor Perry proposed before we exposed it and they had to withdraw the plan in disgrace.
[01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:54.115]  But the Center is going to build these highways on 50-year leases.
[01:17:54.975 --> 01:17:58.816]  Where for instance, let's say Sintra puts up five billion dollars.
[01:17:58.816 --> 01:18:03.518]  The state of Texas subsidizes with a billion dollars.
[01:18:03.518 --> 01:18:06.979]  Sintra builds the extension to the road.
[01:18:06.979 --> 01:18:10.240]  Now they're doing it piece by piece.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.381]  And Sintra gets to run the toll road for 50 years on a 50-year lease.
[01:18:15.381 --> 01:18:22.663]  And Sintra in Spain collects the tolls from the motorists driving in Texas.
[01:18:22.663 --> 01:18:23.924]  And again, this was something that
[01:18:24.964 --> 01:18:27.186]  Governor Perry said he'd put an end to 2009.
[01:18:27.186 --> 01:18:31.508]  There was a pledge to end the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:18:31.508 --> 01:18:36.251]  Don't forget, you've seen the clips where CNN just said it didn't even exist.
[01:18:36.251 --> 01:18:36.912]  Right, exactly.
[01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:47.699]  I mean, they're still denying that any of this planning exists or that, you know, Winnipeg up in Canada has been declared by Prime Minister Harper to be an inland port.
[01:18:48.379 --> 01:18:50.680]  And they're building the same infrastructure.
[01:19:06.326 --> 01:19:06.886]  I don't
[01:19:24.008 --> 01:19:24.848]  We're good to go.
[01:19:51.414 --> 01:19:53.555]  Well, it's all in the SPP documents.
[01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:54.915]  We're going to be right back to get into this.
[01:19:54.915 --> 01:19:56.316]  But then I want to get into the guns with you.
[01:19:56.316 --> 01:20:02.058]  And I want to get into the Middle East, Benghazi, because you're an expert on this.
[01:20:02.058 --> 01:20:04.679]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East.
[01:20:04.679 --> 01:20:07.540]  But we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:10.721]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:20:10.721 --> 01:20:13.502]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:20:13.502 --> 01:20:16.443]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:20:16.443 --> 01:20:19.424]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:20:19.904 --> 01:20:25.025]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:20:25.025 --> 01:20:27.646]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:20:27.646 --> 01:20:31.227]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

[01:22:29.312 --> 01:22:30.553]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:30.553 --> 01:22:35.116]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:40.940]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:44.582]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.582 --> 01:22:47.304]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:22:59.412 --> 01:23:00.413]  Hi there.
[01:23:00.413 --> 01:23:01.934]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:01.934 --> 01:23:05.796]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:23:05.796 --> 01:23:14.943]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:23:14.943 --> 01:23:21.647]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:23:21.647 --> 01:23:23.848]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:23:23.848 --> 01:23:28.932]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:23:29.692 --> 01:23:37.638]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:43.201]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:43.201 --> 01:23:49.705]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:23:49.705 --> 01:23:55.489]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:56.650]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:24:20.048 --> 01:24:24.093]  To be kind to Dr. Jerome Corsi who's with us again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:24:24.093 --> 01:24:36.366]  I've been right up front in this, going to the CAMPO board meetings, watching the takeover, reading the SPP documents that Judicial Watch sued and got, and I know Dr. Corsi's been on this even more than I have, but watching in Texas.
[01:24:37.816 --> 01:24:39.697]  They don't even follow their agreements.
[01:24:39.697 --> 01:24:46.040]  In fact, most of the new toll road stuff is built off existing toll roads on roads you're not even supposed to put them on.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.001]  They break the law and do that.
[01:24:48.001 --> 01:24:49.642]  Bush signed an executive order.
[01:24:49.642 --> 01:24:51.043]  I guess they say that makes it all right.
[01:24:52.210 --> 01:24:56.134]  I guess they could sign an executive order saying the moon was made of cheese.
[01:24:56.134 --> 01:25:01.459]  And then most of these new roads get paid for with taxpayer money, and then Sentra just gets the money.
[01:25:01.459 --> 01:25:08.346]  But I want to get into that, and that's why I originally asked the guys to get you on, Dr. Korsi, and I appreciate you coming on, but what about the overall?
[01:25:08.346 --> 01:25:09.407]  I'm going to go back into it.
[01:25:09.407 --> 01:25:14.332]  I know you're focused on this now, but what about the overall going after the guns?
[01:25:14.332 --> 01:25:15.513]  I know you've been writing about that.
[01:25:17.255 --> 01:25:23.200]  And the Republicans selling out to massive tax increases, I mean, they're trying to collectivize this country.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.205]  They know massive tax increases are going to shut the economy off, but I guess that's the plan to get people on welfare.
[01:25:30.359 --> 01:25:31.700]  Let's first deal with the guns.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:49.789]  I mean, I wrote an article, also sent it in to your producers there, on the shooting that was, you know, the recent shooting at the elementary school in Sandy Hook, and I interviewed some of the top psychiatrists in the world.
[01:25:49.789 --> 01:25:58.874]  Dr. David Healy, who is in Great Britain, Peter Bragan, Harvard-trained, formerly full-time consultant to the National Institute of Mental Health.
[01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:14.243]  And they universally told me that these kids who are shooting in the schools, these incidences are almost 90% linked with the medications prescribed to these kids by psychiatrists.
[01:26:15.023 --> 01:26:24.408]  In other words, what happens is the school shootings, a kid, let's say, in school is a little bit difficult to deal with and maybe has some problems at home.
[01:26:24.408 --> 01:26:33.373]  So immediately, the doctors come in and they diagnose the kid as having some psychological disorder, an attention deficit disorder.
[01:26:33.373 --> 01:26:43.999]  They get him psychiatric treatment and put him on forced medication, Ritalin or Prozac or any number of other very powerful drugs.
[01:26:44.719 --> 01:26:46.979]  And these are psychotropic drugs.
[01:26:46.979 --> 01:26:57.122]  They produce, especially in these adolescents, a form of suicidal and violent outbursts.
[01:26:57.122 --> 01:27:12.665]  So if you look at the incidents that have occurred and track down who these shooters are, you're going to find that about 90%, especially the high profile cases, these kids were on medication prescribed by psychiatrists.
[01:27:13.485 --> 01:27:21.610]  On behavioral problems, which may or may not have been real, or may have just been an attempt to control a difficult kid in a school environment.
[01:27:21.610 --> 01:27:37.920]  And by the way, I covered your article last week, and when you say 90% that these scientists, these doctors are being conservative, they count the few gang-related shootings where three or four people shoot each other as in that, and in those cases, you know, they're usually just drug dealers.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.981]  So that's why it goes down to 90.
[01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:41.883]  If you look at the real mass shootings,
[01:27:42.703 --> 01:27:48.889]  It's always goth, whites, or Hispanics who are avowed devil worshippers.
[01:27:48.889 --> 01:27:56.076]  I mean, every case, they are into the occult, they are avowed devil worshippers, and they are on psychotropic drugs.
[01:27:56.076 --> 01:27:58.559]  I mean, it's more like 100%.
[01:27:58.559 --> 01:28:05.746]  In fact, I can't find cases where the real mass shooters, where it's like 10, 15, 20 people, and it's not gang-related, aren't on these drugs.
[01:28:06.266 --> 01:28:09.927]  Well, in fact, Dr. Bragin was particularly good.
[01:28:09.927 --> 01:28:13.767]  He said a lot of these kids are just kids that are in a normal environment.
[01:28:13.767 --> 01:28:18.688]  You go back 40, 50 years, first of all, you'd have God in the school.
[01:28:18.688 --> 01:28:21.709]  You'd have parents around that could be involved.
[01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:25.369]  The kid might need some attention, might be a lonely kid.
[01:28:25.369 --> 01:28:30.110]  Now the school, which doesn't really want to deal with the kids in general, in particular.
[01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:32.191]  They don't want to spend any teacher time.
[01:28:32.191 --> 01:28:33.251]  The teachers aren't trained.
[01:28:33.971 --> 01:28:36.612]  So they get the psychiatrists involved.
[01:28:36.612 --> 01:28:39.274]  They prescribe these extremely powerful drugs.
[01:28:39.274 --> 01:28:40.574]  They put them on suicide pills.
[01:28:40.574 --> 01:28:44.236]  The insert says, cause you to commit mass murder and suicide.
[01:28:44.236 --> 01:28:51.000]  And these pills are extremely dangerous, psychotropic effects, which produce the suicidal tendencies and the violent tendencies.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.440]  The kids further withdraw.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:29:02.686]  They withdraw into these video games, which are, you know, killing video games in this created world of fantasy of killing and violence.
[01:29:02.686 --> 01:29:03.126]  And then when
[01:29:03.746 --> 01:29:07.429]  These kids acted out in reality in a school.
[01:29:07.429 --> 01:29:08.650]  People are surprised.
[01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:10.171]  I mean, there's no reason to be surprised.
[01:29:10.171 --> 01:29:10.752]  Doctor!
[01:29:10.752 --> 01:29:11.212]  Doctor!
[01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:18.518]  If you study Chinese-style mind control in CIA, it's drugging with scenarios.
[01:29:18.518 --> 01:29:22.222]  These video games were designed to create instinctive killing by the U.S.
[01:29:22.222 --> 01:29:24.183]  military, non-thinking.
[01:29:24.183 --> 01:29:30.609]  You put them on mind control drugs and put them on a Pentagon killing simulator, what do you think you're going to get?
[01:29:31.212 --> 01:29:41.335]  Well, and in fact, a lot of these video games were created by the military in order to increase the percentage of soldiers in combat that would actually use lethal force.
[01:29:41.335 --> 01:29:48.157]  It's one of the little appreciated secrets of combat going back to the... Break this down, doctor!
[01:29:48.157 --> 01:29:49.178]  Break it down on the other side.
[01:29:49.178 --> 01:29:49.938]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:49.938 --> 01:29:51.318]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.318 --> 01:29:52.939]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.939 --> 01:29:56.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:04.731]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:30:04.731 --> 01:30:05.952]  Don't be one of them!
[01:30:05.952 --> 01:30:11.655]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.
[01:30:11.655 --> 01:30:21.460]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound healing.
[01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:28.143]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases.
[01:30:28.243 --> 01:30:28.643]  I think so.

[01:33:01.906 --> 01:33:12.131]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says fool me once, shame on, shame on you.
[01:33:13.513 --> 01:33:15.578]  Fool men can't get fooled again.
[01:33:15.578 --> 01:33:18.003]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:18.003 --> 01:33:21.250]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:23.615]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:32.974]  You know, Dr. Corsi is probably more qualified to talk about Benghazi than anybody I probably know.
[01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:35.896]  And I should have gotten him on the last few months about that.
[01:33:35.896 --> 01:33:37.877]  It's just that it gets lost in the shuffle.
[01:33:37.877 --> 01:33:43.320]  And I'm jumping in, chomping at the bit, wanting to back up everything he says because it's so on target.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:48.523]  I want to get into that and Hillary's feigned garbage and all this other stuff that's going on.
[01:33:49.503 --> 01:33:56.806]  And where he sees America in general going, does he agree with my analysis that it is just runaway train right now?
[01:33:56.806 --> 01:33:58.947]  Is there any way to stop the takeover?
[01:33:58.947 --> 01:34:00.908]  Why do the globalists think it's their opportunity?
[01:34:00.908 --> 01:34:03.749]  Is it a response to seeing an awakening happening?
[01:34:03.749 --> 01:34:06.611]  They're trying to head us off at the pass.
[01:34:06.611 --> 01:34:07.711]  I want to get his take on that.
[01:34:07.711 --> 01:34:11.013]  I want to go back into the Napa superhighway because it ties in
[01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:26.704]  To this tactic now that those of us that are awake go, this is ridiculous and discrediting that they announce there's no global government being formed, but in hundreds of financial papers they brag how they're forming a world government run by private banks.
[01:34:26.704 --> 01:34:28.565]  So why are they doing that?
[01:34:28.565 --> 01:34:33.090]  Well, because we're informed the general public folks doesn't know where their state capital is.
[01:34:34.141 --> 01:34:37.982]  You have to understand, people think of knowing things as work.
[01:34:37.982 --> 01:34:42.944]  They never discover that knowing things is addictive, and it's what really being alive is.
[01:34:42.944 --> 01:34:50.506]  And so you gotta understand, I mean, the general public is just not even dumb, they're ignorant.
[01:34:50.506 --> 01:35:02.089]  And this tactic of just lying... I mean, at hospitals everywhere, everybody I know goes into the hospital and they say, we're not gonna fix your broken leg till you take a flu shot.
[01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:04.858]  And they're like, but you have to render care.
[01:35:04.858 --> 01:35:05.739]  And they go, we're not going to.
[01:35:05.739 --> 01:35:07.200]  Get out.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.342]  I mean, it's totally illegal on so many fronts.
[01:35:09.342 --> 01:35:10.363]  I mean, I've had lawyers on.
[01:35:10.363 --> 01:35:11.925]  It's unbelievable.
[01:35:11.925 --> 01:35:12.886]  That's what tyranny is.
[01:35:12.886 --> 01:35:17.470]  It's a willful criminal oppression.
[01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:18.812]  And they're just doing it.
[01:35:20.194 --> 01:35:26.137]  And now they're going to set up armored checkpoints all over the highways to, quote, check for gang members.
[01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:27.438]  It's just incredible.
[01:35:27.438 --> 01:35:36.903]  Dr. Corsi, getting back to what you were going to talk about with, for those that don't know, the statistics from World War I, World War II on troops wouldn't kill people up close, so...
[01:35:37.623 --> 01:35:43.569]  The Department of Defense developed, and you're right, this is something even foreign governments really didn't pick up on for a while.
[01:35:43.569 --> 01:35:46.731]  It's given the, quote, United States the edge.
[01:35:46.731 --> 01:35:49.354]  Murder simulators, killer simulators.
[01:35:49.354 --> 01:35:50.215]  Tell people about that.
[01:35:50.762 --> 01:35:58.246]  Well, these original combat video games were developed by the military around the time of Vietnam.
[01:35:58.246 --> 01:36:05.249]  Because the little known secret is that in combat, most of the killing in person is done by 2 or 3% of the troops.
[01:36:05.249 --> 01:36:07.611]  A lot of troops will not use violence.
[01:36:08.331 --> 01:36:13.034]  Lethal violence where they can actually see the enemy, even when they're in danger themselves.
[01:36:13.034 --> 01:36:20.838]  So in Vietnam, our troops exposed to these kinds of games were able to get the kill ratio up to about 90%.
[01:36:20.838 --> 01:36:24.900]  90% of the people in combat would be willing to use lethal force.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:37.127]  And that's where these games started, because psychologically, they engineered desensitization, or desensitized process to where killing another human being or using lethal force against another human being
[01:36:37.967 --> 01:36:39.288]  It's no longer repugnant.
[01:36:39.288 --> 01:36:44.052]  It becomes acceptable in the frame of behavior for the person to find for themselves.
[01:36:44.052 --> 01:36:54.760]  That in combination with the type of psychotropic drugs that we are regularly handing out in our schools is a formula for disaster.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:06.649]  Kids play these games, get programmed for violence, take the drugs, the drugs affect their psychology, their thinking, they become suicidal and violent, and then we wonder why we have the incidents in the schools.
[01:37:06.749 --> 01:37:08.850]  And we wonder why the military has record suicide.
[01:37:08.850 --> 01:37:12.671]  And we wonder why the U.S., the number one cause of death now, is suicide.
[01:37:12.671 --> 01:37:14.512]  Wasn't in the top ten fifty years ago.
[01:37:14.512 --> 01:37:16.553]  In fact, folks, you can show ABC News.
[01:37:16.553 --> 01:37:19.133]  Number one cause of unnatural death, now suicide.
[01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:22.695]  We're a nation on suicide mass murder pills.
[01:37:22.695 --> 01:37:25.296]  And the social engineers know this full well.
[01:37:25.296 --> 01:37:26.896]  Of course they do.
[01:37:26.896 --> 01:37:29.737]  And I want to skip to, you know, with the time we've got.
[01:37:29.737 --> 01:37:32.198]  I've been writing again about the economics.
[01:37:32.198 --> 01:37:33.379]  I have an article out today that
[01:37:35.179 --> 01:37:52.371]  Ben Bernanke, in the time he's been in the Fed, which started in February 1, 2006, on December 12th, which is when they announced this QE4, another round of buying our own debt, that period of time from 2006 to December 12th, 2012, Bernanke doubled the amount of national debt.
[01:37:59.275 --> 01:38:12.389]  We went from 8.13 trillion dollars to 16.4 trillion dollars and this is again another conscious process of destroying the United States.
[01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:38.646]  Yes, QE4, Quantitative Easing 4, which is the economist's term for it, means that we're going to be buying monthly $85 billion of our own treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, which keeps interest rates artificially low, but is essentially creating so much liquidity
[01:38:39.467 --> 01:38:44.628]  That the dollar is becoming debased and is setting up the precondition for hyperinflation.
[01:38:45.066 --> 01:38:48.428]  Hyperinflation is now an inevitability.
[01:38:48.428 --> 01:38:50.110]  It's built into the system.
[01:38:50.110 --> 01:39:09.603]  And again, the economists know this, because in the crisis of hyperinflation, crisis of all these mountains of debt, the Americans will give up freedom, they'll move into an international environment to allow the... And by the way, you worked in banking at the highest level, so again, you are uniquely able to speak to this.
[01:39:09.603 --> 01:39:10.764]  What's the time frame?
[01:39:10.764 --> 01:39:11.705]  How bad is it going to get?
[01:39:12.205 --> 01:39:23.209]  Well, first of all, we're going to be at a point where we may double again the national debt, not within, it may not take us six years this time.
[01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:26.370]  We may do it within three or four years.
[01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:30.392]  Certainly, we're going to be over $20 trillion by 2014.
[01:39:30.392 --> 01:39:37.475]  And when we get over $20 trillion, remember, our gross national product is under $16 trillion.
[01:39:37.475 --> 01:39:37.995]  Unbelievable.
[01:39:38.735 --> 01:39:51.322]  So by the end of 2014, which is in two years, when we're coming up with the next congressional election, I expect us to be in another economic crisis of hyperinflation.
[01:39:51.322 --> 01:39:54.723]  And this whole deal of fiscal cliff is a fiction.
[01:39:54.723 --> 01:39:56.765]  We went over the fiscal cliff a long time ago.
[01:39:57.725 --> 01:40:05.352]  This recent legislation did nothing to solve the fiscal crisis in the United States.
[01:40:05.352 --> 01:40:12.378]  We actually have more spending in the bill that was just signed, just passed, in this emergency fashion.
[01:40:12.378 --> 01:40:15.581]  And the idea that people, again, lies were rampant.
[01:40:16.101 --> 01:40:20.664]  Obama was saying that no middle class taxes were going to be increased.
[01:40:20.664 --> 01:40:33.612]  77% of Americans who pay taxes are going to have an increase because of the phasing out of the 2% relief that was granted on the FICA reductions on payroll taxes.
[01:40:33.612 --> 01:40:34.593]  That's going back in.
[01:40:35.333 --> 01:40:40.515]  So, you know, even though this lie was told, Obama would say, well, I didn't mean that.
[01:40:40.515 --> 01:40:46.498]  But people are still going to get smaller take-home pay, and they can judge for themselves whether they were lied to.
[01:40:46.498 --> 01:40:48.679]  The federal government lies to us regularly.
[01:40:48.679 --> 01:40:55.883]  Obama now lies boldly, and doesn't even get called for it by the mainstream media.
[01:40:55.883 --> 01:41:02.566]  And this whole idea of increasing our debt to a proportion that's unprecedented in the history of the world,
[01:41:03.226 --> 01:41:05.549]  You know, buying our own debt.
[01:41:05.549 --> 01:41:06.851]  I mean, you have to get your mind around it.
[01:41:06.851 --> 01:41:11.438]  Treasury is issuing debt and we are buying it in the Federal Reserve.
[01:41:12.572 --> 01:41:13.693]  It's so insane.
[01:41:13.693 --> 01:41:17.835]  And at some point or other, you can't keep doing this.
[01:41:17.835 --> 01:41:20.256]  You can't keep printing money.
[01:41:20.256 --> 01:41:22.157]  This is just blatantly printing money.
[01:41:22.157 --> 01:41:29.341]  And the liquidity may boost the stock market, but eventually, like the Weimar Republic, you get into hyperinflation.
[01:41:29.341 --> 01:41:37.785]  And the authorities doing this, including Ben Bernanke, know that it is inevitable that they're going to debase the dollar.
[01:41:37.785 --> 01:41:40.066]  In fact, it's a plan to debase the dollar.
[01:41:40.066 --> 01:41:41.387]  You can't look at it any other way.
[01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:52.048]  Now, I wrote, I mean I've also got, I sent in the links, I just published a book on Obama's plan to bankrupt the United States.
[01:41:52.048 --> 01:41:55.111]  And this goes to the Cloward-Piven theory.
[01:41:55.111 --> 01:42:02.097]  And I really think it's critical people understand what the Cloward... Yeah, we're going to put your new book up and we've been showing WorldNetDaily and the information.
[01:42:02.097 --> 01:42:03.298]  In fact, I want to get this book.
[01:42:03.298 --> 01:42:04.018]  I haven't read it yet.
[01:42:04.018 --> 01:42:05.199]  We've carried your other books.
[01:42:05.199 --> 01:42:06.921]  But I know this is going to be powerful because
[01:42:08.442 --> 01:42:16.129]  I know their game plan as well, and what's incredible is, and I know you know about this, you've written about it, they brag that they're bankrupting us.
[01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:19.932]  Communists don't bankrupt things on accident.
[01:42:19.932 --> 01:42:23.975]  We always say communists are bad managers, and quote things don't work.
[01:42:23.975 --> 01:42:26.918]  Because of the incredible production of the last hundred years,
[01:42:27.518 --> 01:42:36.663]  And science, even in a communist system that wasn't run by devils, it'd be horrible and it would be unfair, but everything wouldn't collapse.
[01:42:36.663 --> 01:42:39.884]  They collapsed Ukraine and Poland on purpose.
[01:42:39.884 --> 01:42:41.665]  This is not a secret.
[01:42:41.665 --> 01:42:50.169]  They collapsed China and killed between 60 and 80 million people, they debate the numbers, to radically transform forever.
[01:42:50.169 --> 01:42:52.910]  They understand you've got to break eggs to make an omelette.
[01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:54.251]  It's about the control.
[01:42:56.392 --> 01:42:57.953]  The goal is going well.
[01:42:57.953 --> 01:42:58.973]  More people in prison.
[01:42:58.973 --> 01:43:00.714]  More people on welfare.
[01:43:00.714 --> 01:43:03.074]  Paying to ship General Motors to China.
[01:43:03.074 --> 01:43:04.815]  I mean, this is a plan.
[01:43:04.815 --> 01:43:06.816]  And I've read the review of your book.
[01:43:06.816 --> 01:43:09.897]  I know it breaks down where they say it's their plan.
[01:43:09.897 --> 01:43:17.299]  So, explain to people, they're not... California, when they raise taxes over and over again, it's meant to bankrupt the state.
[01:43:17.299 --> 01:43:18.520]  I mean, explain this to people.
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:41.209]  Cloward and Pivarn were two sociologists at Columbia when Obama was there, when Brzezinski was there, and their whole idea was that to destroy capitalism, you create social welfare programs, all the unemployment insurance, the Obama phones, the entire list of programs where the government is paying checks to people.
[01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:57.545]  You build this system to the point where it is so huge, you've got to raise the tax base in order to pay these welfare payments, social welfare payments, entitlements, that the system collapses.
[01:43:57.545 --> 01:44:04.973]  Because the taxes destroy the economic activity, the tax base decreases, the system goes into bankruptcy, and then the
[01:44:05.774 --> 01:44:30.257]  Cloward and Pippa, the sociologists, said that this is the time when we really have the opportunity to create a true socialist, read, communist state in which the principles of social justice, meaning destroying private property, destroying the family, having government control of every aspect of your life, having the bureaucrats make all decisions, including death panels on health insurance,
[01:44:31.718 --> 01:44:34.739]  100% government control of all the means of production.
[01:44:34.739 --> 01:44:36.580]  This is what the communist dream has been.
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:45.705]  The Clower Pivot Theory is a way to make the Democratic Party essentially advocate the socialist themes.
[01:44:46.666 --> 01:44:49.510]  We're trying to help you.
[01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:50.411]  We care about you.
[01:45:03.169 --> 01:45:06.930]  Out of the ashes is born a true socialist communist state.
[01:45:06.930 --> 01:45:14.952]  That's the goal, that's Obama's... And they're going to look to the 90% that don't have jobs anymore from overtaxation and say, we got to kill the old people.
[01:45:14.952 --> 01:45:19.873]  They're already saying this in Slate and Soros outfits.
[01:45:19.873 --> 01:45:21.334]  I mean, it's so diabolical.
[01:45:21.334 --> 01:45:24.674]  And remember, doctor, they always said, oh, there's no death panels.
[01:45:24.674 --> 01:45:25.975]  We're like, it's in the bill.
[01:45:25.975 --> 01:45:27.195]  No, there's not.
[01:45:27.195 --> 01:45:28.755]  There's no NAFTA highway.
[01:45:28.755 --> 01:45:30.256]  What do you make of them coming out?
[01:45:30.956 --> 01:45:35.800]  And saying that Israelis don't own guns and they don't arm teachers.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:41.705]  I mean, the level of lying these people make the Politburo look honest.
[01:45:41.705 --> 01:45:50.472]  In fact, the Democrats who are going to propose this legislation, you know, in themselves own guns and are protected by guns.
[01:45:51.303 --> 01:45:54.005]  If you go into a federal building, you try to go into the U.S.
[01:45:54.005 --> 01:46:06.755]  Congress, you're going to go through metal detectors, you're going to go through all kinds of federal agencies with badges, with guns, examining everything you've got before you get in that building, wanting to know where you're going to go.
[01:46:06.755 --> 01:46:16.062]  The bureaucrats that want these gun-free environments don't themselves operate in a gun-free environment because they know how dangerous it would be.
[01:46:16.062 --> 01:46:16.863]  Well, they're mafia.
[01:46:16.863 --> 01:46:18.404]  Mafia always wants to disarm its slaves.
[01:46:18.404 --> 01:46:19.385]  Here's my question.
[01:46:19.385 --> 01:46:20.866]  What is the general prognosis
[01:46:21.503 --> 01:46:43.395]  Am I right, and Larry Pratt saying this is the worst assault ever, Ron Paul, I mean I want your view on this and then your analysis, how bad is it because they now look gleeful and are attacking on every front and the Republican leadership is collapsing and just saying yes this is what we're going to do because the foreign banks are buying both sides.
[01:46:43.395 --> 01:46:44.976]  The GOP is a disarray.
[01:46:46.056 --> 01:46:56.565]  The globalists and the socialists, the far left, the Bill Ayers crowd has stolen the leadership of the Democratic Party.
[01:46:56.565 --> 01:47:03.511]  This is not the Democratic Party of Jack Kennedy or Hubert Humphrey or Harry Truman.
[01:47:03.511 --> 01:47:05.193]  That party's dead.
[01:47:05.193 --> 01:47:07.695]  This is the radical left.
[01:47:07.695 --> 01:47:10.297]  The socialists read communists.
[01:47:11.218 --> 01:47:14.440]  I saw another slate article today calling to get rid of our free speech.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.720]  I mean, these people are monsters.
[01:47:26.365 --> 01:47:35.670]  You get a Sandy Hook coming on, immediately the New World Order agenda jumps on this for gun legislation.
[01:47:35.670 --> 01:47:36.991]  The worst possible thing.
[01:47:36.991 --> 01:47:43.414]  And then when the NRA tries to hold a press conference, they get ridiculed by the mainstream media.
[01:47:43.414 --> 01:47:47.676]  The demonstrations, the acting up, the agenda is not heard.
[01:47:47.676 --> 01:47:49.177]  The lies are being told.
[01:47:50.898 --> 01:47:53.660]  Teachers are armed in Israel.
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:48:02.906]  Yes, if you walk around Israel, there are automatic weapons being held by off-duty military in uniform.
[01:48:02.906 --> 01:48:06.109]  It's a very militarized environment because it's the only way it's safe.
[01:48:07.142 --> 01:48:15.488]  And in fact, if you do create these gun-free zones, the truth is, like Chicago, you're going to create a free-killing zone.
[01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:17.590]  And then they bring the military in as the answer.
[01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:18.570]  See how they do it?
[01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:24.515]  They take the citizens' guns, it becomes a crime system, then they bring in troops, which is what they're now doing.
[01:48:24.515 --> 01:48:33.281]  They rely on the government to protect you, which is exactly... Our Founding Fathers advised us, do not rely on the government to do anything for you.
[01:48:33.281 --> 01:48:34.982]  Let me ask you this, are they going to win?
[01:48:34.982 --> 01:48:35.903]  I mean, how bad is it?
[01:48:36.892 --> 01:48:46.701]  Well it's going to be, it's the closest to the globalists and the socialist communists left winning, and they're using the Saul Alinsky agenda.
[01:48:46.701 --> 01:48:59.433]  Obama is going to, again, you've got to read these two e-books I wrote, the one on the Saul Alinsky, the evil genius behind Obama, and Obama's plan to bankrupt the USA, the Cloward-Pippen theory, because it explains what they're doing.
[01:49:00.194 --> 01:49:06.258]  They're using the class warfare, resentment against the rich, we've got to tax the rich.
[01:49:06.258 --> 01:49:22.307]  Even with Obama getting this agreement on the fiscal cliff, he's already saying in videotaped presentations to his constituency, the Obama for America crowd, that he hasn't taxed the rich are still not paying their fair share.
[01:49:22.307 --> 01:49:26.030]  Howard Dean came out and said the poorest people need to pay more taxes.
[01:49:26.590 --> 01:49:33.236]  Well, in fact, the point is that the socialist agenda, nobody in the end owns any private property.
[01:49:33.236 --> 01:49:37.681]  Except the master bureaucrats who are exempt from all the rules.
[01:49:37.681 --> 01:49:48.872]  And are protected by the military, do not themselves live in gun-free zones, don't give up their weapons, but in fact... No, no, they all have bodyguards, that's a status symbol of them.
[01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:52.672]  Bodyguards.
[01:49:52.672 --> 01:49:58.936]  Go into a federal building that you don't have to go through a metal detector with badges and guns.
[01:49:58.936 --> 01:50:02.959]  Michael Moore has five to six bodyguards every time I've seen him.
[01:50:02.959 --> 01:50:05.120]  Piers Morgan has armed bodyguards.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:06.161]  I mean, it's all on record.
[01:50:06.661 --> 01:50:15.448]  Hypocrisy and the lying of the New World Order and the, this, you know, Bill Ayer's left, that Sabato left, has never been greater.
[01:50:15.448 --> 01:50:22.234]  They're lying about everything, saying, oh no, we don't have a NAFTA superhighway, there's no public-private partnerships here.
[01:50:22.234 --> 01:50:30.301]  Then you look, and you find there's $20 billion of deals that Governor Perry has signed with, you know, with Centra in Spain.
[01:50:30.301 --> 01:50:34.865]  No, no, they bragged in the AP years ago, they said, Perry's just going ahead in chunks.
[01:50:36.411 --> 01:50:37.392]  I mean, it's not a secret.
[01:50:37.392 --> 01:50:40.035]  They just laugh at us.
[01:50:40.035 --> 01:50:40.635]  Incredible.
[01:50:40.635 --> 01:50:41.316]  Incredible.
[01:50:41.316 --> 01:50:41.916]  Just stay there, Doc.
[01:50:41.916 --> 01:50:42.517]  We've got to get a break.
[01:50:42.517 --> 01:50:45.500]  I want to come back and get more into just the economy.
[01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.902]  I mean, is there any way to turn this around?
[01:50:47.902 --> 01:50:49.684]  How bad is it going to get?
[01:50:49.684 --> 01:50:56.511]  And then we'll have the third hour with a bunch of special reports we're going to premiere here and a bunch of news and so much more.
[01:50:56.511 --> 01:50:58.272]  We've just got to get the word out.
[01:50:58.272 --> 01:51:00.875]  These people are such authoritarians, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:09.055]  Big business has discovered the preparedness market, and that makes it difficult to know where to go and who to trust.

[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:08.343]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:08.343 --> 01:52:17.311]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:17.311 --> 01:52:22.235]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:22.848 --> 01:52:34.220]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:41.247]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:52:46.209 --> 01:52:49.811]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[01:52:57.075 --> 01:52:58.355]  Protect your immune system.

[01:53:00.057 --> 01:53:04.820]  Weakened by GMOs, stressed out about money, and blasted by the electric environment.
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:08.002]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[01:53:08.002 --> 01:53:11.324]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[01:53:11.324 --> 01:53:22.990]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other tissues behave.
[01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:27.713]  I learned I don't have to put up with disease, decay, or decline like I'd been conditioned to believe.
[01:53:27.713 --> 01:53:29.274]  I began taking RNA drops
[01:53:29.634 --> 01:53:35.657]  A 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy.

[01:54:08.455 --> 01:54:19.224]  We've got an extremely powerful video piece we did to counter Mayor Bloomberg's piece with all the different actors saying, turn your guns in.
[01:54:19.224 --> 01:54:28.392]  One of our listeners, again I'm proud that our listeners are so active, put out a video showing how each actor in there is in these movies involved in gratuitous mass murder and shooting.
[01:54:30.154 --> 01:54:37.400]  Which then anti-gunners, who aren't even gun owners, because there's not just the predatory anti-gunners, who know they want to disarm us and make us slaves.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:44.626]  There's folks who've never had guns, and they think of guns like Hollywood, that every time a gun's out, somebody's oozing someone.
[01:54:45.936 --> 01:54:48.679]  And they're real scared of them, and Hollywood helps do that.
[01:54:48.679 --> 01:54:57.307]  And one of our listeners put out a video that's had millions of views, because DrudgeReport.com linked to it, and then Fox News picked it up, and all these other channels.
[01:54:57.307 --> 01:54:59.589]  That's what I keep telling listeners.
[01:54:59.589 --> 01:55:04.694]  I'm nobody special, folks, and I've reached 15 million people a week now, one way or another.
[01:55:05.689 --> 01:55:06.350]  Okay.
[01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:09.032]  People like Dr. Corsi, who's well-researched and smart.
[01:55:09.032 --> 01:55:12.654]  He reaches millions every week in interviews and his books.
[01:55:12.654 --> 01:55:21.301]  One of our listeners, because I went to his channel and saw that he listens to the show and some of his videos, went and did something that's been seen by tens of millions now.
[01:55:22.839 --> 01:55:28.080]  And we're going to put a video out that hopefully will get seen by millions that really counters Bloomberg.
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:30.001]  It's up to you, though.
[01:55:30.001 --> 01:55:31.821]  And just thank God for Drudge.
[01:55:31.821 --> 01:55:33.341]  Listen, I've got to say something, Dr. Corsi.
[01:55:33.341 --> 01:55:37.162]  I'm not just kissing the rumpus of DrudgeReport.com.
[01:55:37.162 --> 01:55:40.503]  I've been tracking it, and more and more.
[01:55:40.503 --> 01:55:41.543]  It's WorldNet Daily.
[01:55:41.543 --> 01:55:42.384]  It's InfoWars.
[01:55:44.464 --> 01:55:54.670]  We're like Junior when it comes to really just every time Drudge is able to take our information and others and his research and really force it out there.
[01:55:54.670 --> 01:55:59.253]  And I see the system always demonizing Drudge because they don't like it.
[01:55:59.253 --> 01:56:04.836]  And I think it's a tale and an example, an allegory of the fact that we can win.
[01:56:05.506 --> 01:56:11.654]  You know, if we get aggressive now, so let me ask you solutions in this segment and five in the next hour, I know you've got to go.
[01:56:11.654 --> 01:56:14.598]  What can we do to really beat these people?
[01:56:14.598 --> 01:56:20.266]  Because even a lot of folks don't like socialism, but their jobs have been shipped overseas.
[01:56:20.266 --> 01:56:21.187]  They're disabled.
[01:56:22.168 --> 01:56:24.489]  First of all, you're right about Drudge.
[01:56:24.489 --> 01:56:27.191]  Drudge is doing Yeoman's work, and so are you, Alex.
[01:56:27.191 --> 01:56:28.431]  We're in the battle.
[01:56:28.431 --> 01:56:29.992]  We're doing it every day as well at WND.
[01:56:41.248 --> 01:56:49.633]  The weapon we've got is the truth, and we've got to keep developing and presenting the truth to the American people.
[01:56:49.633 --> 01:56:56.097]  We've got the advantages of being able to communicate with millions of people through the Internet.
[01:56:56.097 --> 01:57:00.940]  We've got the ability to get the word out, and people are reading and paying attention.
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:08.906]  In the next few years, we're going to have to learn how to even use social media more effectively, how to use all these techniques of reaching people,
[01:57:09.666 --> 01:57:13.912]  One by one in their homes, knowing who our listeners are.
[01:57:13.912 --> 01:57:23.885]  There's great advances coming in the ability, I believe, to technologically reach people and communicate with people individually, but in large numbers.
[01:57:23.885 --> 01:57:25.707]  But the advantage we've got is the truth.
[01:57:26.621 --> 01:57:35.165]  And I think if we keep going back to it, I mean, every one of the articles I write, Alex, I footnote, I've got all kinds, you can go look at the original sources.
[01:57:35.165 --> 01:57:48.670]  That's what, you know, made the articles of the North American Union, going back to when I was writing The Late Great USA in 2005, 2006, so powerful, was I linked to their own documents, the government's own documents.
[01:57:48.670 --> 01:57:50.331]  If you look at the article I have on
[01:57:50.911 --> 01:57:53.672]  Bernanke increasing our debt.
[01:57:53.672 --> 01:57:57.813]  I linked to the Federal Reserve minutes in which that is announced.
[01:57:57.813 --> 01:57:59.253]  Which is a document that's boring.
[01:57:59.253 --> 01:58:00.893]  Most people don't want to read it.
[01:58:00.893 --> 01:58:03.314]  But when you see it, it's startling.
[01:58:03.314 --> 01:58:10.976]  Because there, the Federal Reserve is telling you they're going to buy $85 billion a month.
[01:58:10.976 --> 01:58:11.956]  It's staggering.
[01:58:11.956 --> 01:58:15.057]  It's like, we're going to buy a trillion dollars of our own debt.
[01:58:16.112 --> 01:58:22.495]  And as if that's, you know, buying your own debt is like having a, you know, a printing press in your basement.
[01:58:22.495 --> 01:58:24.576]  So, checks come in, don't worry about it.
[01:58:24.576 --> 01:58:27.717]  We'll just keep printing money and send out, pay the bills.
[01:58:27.717 --> 01:58:34.440]  But the globalists, they get real goods for that and then we get handed the debt when most of its derivatives stay there.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.041]  Again, we're bailing the bankers out.
[01:58:36.041 --> 01:58:37.321]  We're gonna do five more minutes.
[01:58:37.321 --> 01:58:41.383]  I wanna hear more solutions.
[01:58:41.383 --> 01:58:43.084]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.881 --> 01:58:47.107]  Visit GCNlive.com today!

[01:59:53.657 --> 01:59:56.062]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.062 --> 01:59:58.848]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.529 --> 02:00:10.353]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.353 --> 02:00:11.935]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.935 --> 02:00:13.476]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.476 --> 02:00:17.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:23.385]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.385 --> 02:00:25.527]  Dr. Jerome, of course, he's got to leave in about four or five minutes.
[02:00:25.527 --> 02:00:27.389]  He's got another interview coming up.
[02:00:27.389 --> 02:00:30.072]  And again, I've been covering the whole field here, throwing stuff at him.
[02:00:32.421 --> 02:00:34.303]  Finishing up with solutions.
[02:00:34.303 --> 02:00:40.168]  I guess the solution is the truth, as you said, and knowing what their plans are.
[02:00:40.168 --> 02:00:41.329]  Bankrupting America.
[02:00:41.329 --> 02:00:43.971]  How do you expect things to go?
[02:00:43.971 --> 02:00:48.334]  Sure, people are waking up, but the power structure is accelerating things.
[02:00:48.334 --> 02:00:51.797]  In your gut, how do you see things ending?
[02:00:51.797 --> 02:00:54.500]  And in your gut, are you the most concerned you've ever been?
[02:00:55.296 --> 02:00:57.800]  I'm the most concerned I've ever been.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:11.358]  And we're going to have a series of crises that are produced that the only solution offered is more government control by both parties, Democrats and Republicans alike.
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:21.513]  This is where the Tea Party has got to recognize that the Republican Party is not necessarily a natural home for a conservative movement.
[02:01:21.513 --> 02:01:26.680]  It's not only exposing the truth, which we've got to do, but it's exposing the hypocrisy
[02:01:27.601 --> 02:01:30.564]  of the socialists, the communists, the Obamas.
[02:01:30.564 --> 02:01:34.868]  Obama lives, he's talking about, you know, the rich don't pay their fair share.
[02:01:34.868 --> 02:01:44.698]  Well, Obama's living a life that would make most kings and queens in history pale in comparison to the privileges he gives himself and his family.
[02:01:44.698 --> 02:01:46.319]  We've got to expose this.
[02:01:46.319 --> 02:01:50.403]  Al Gore does not live a carbon efficient life.
[02:01:51.224 --> 02:01:52.025]  None of these people.
[02:01:52.025 --> 02:02:01.274]  Michael Moore is protected by weapons, as is Nancy Pelosi, as is Senator Feinstein, and Chuck Schumer.
[02:02:01.274 --> 02:02:09.142]  All these people go into a federal building to work all day, where you go through a metal detector and there's guards all over the place to protect them.
[02:02:10.303 --> 02:02:14.426]  The hypocrisy is what exposes the New World Order.
[02:02:14.426 --> 02:02:16.687]  The lies and the hypocrisy.
[02:02:16.687 --> 02:02:24.612]  And the crises are what I'm concerned about because the capability of producing... People have got to understand this cloud or pivot theory.
[02:02:24.612 --> 02:02:31.337]  That the engineered bankruptcy that we're in, this expansion of the entitlement programs, is a plan.
[02:02:32.017 --> 02:02:36.282]  That's a plan to cause capitalism to crumble so people will give up freedom.
[02:02:36.282 --> 02:02:43.070]  And then they blame capitalism when we've left capitalism and this is crony fascist socialism.
[02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:44.852]  Removal of God from everywhere.
[02:02:44.852 --> 02:02:46.814]  This is a major theme.
[02:02:46.814 --> 02:02:51.980]  You know, the school in which the kid who's on, you know, psychiatrically prescribed drugs
[02:02:52.921 --> 02:02:55.361]  Playing all day video games at his home.
[02:02:55.361 --> 02:02:56.742]  Comes into that school.
[02:02:56.742 --> 02:03:00.483]  You couldn't even use the word God in that school without being arrested.
[02:03:00.483 --> 02:03:02.643]  But then Obama would pray once it came time.
[02:03:02.643 --> 02:03:08.284]  They still give us the old thing every once in a while like it's a treat they give us to then punch our buttons.
[02:03:08.284 --> 02:03:14.185]  It's all masterfully done and you get back to that when you remove God, the devil comes in.
[02:03:14.185 --> 02:03:17.386]  You know it's funny all these killers, they're not atheists, they're devil worshippers.
[02:03:18.146 --> 02:03:24.248]  Play the God theme like music on, you know, an organ to get our emotions going.
[02:03:24.248 --> 02:03:25.649]  So we say, oh, isn't it horrible?
[02:03:25.649 --> 02:03:27.890]  We've got to get the guns out of the schools.
[02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:31.751]  No, you've got to get armed guards in the schools.
[02:03:31.751 --> 02:03:38.774]  You've got to get these kids, so the teachers in the teachers union, who don't want to spend any time dealing with problem children.
[02:03:39.654 --> 02:03:45.516]  Can't just send them off to a psychiatrist and give them Ritalin or Prozac or some other... Well look, I'll say this.
[02:03:45.516 --> 02:03:55.140]  It'd be better to put kids in a boot camp to get their butts kicked than assault them with Prozac and Ritalin that literally destroys their hearts and brains and organs.
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:56.521]  And again, that's the problem.
[02:03:56.521 --> 02:04:04.384]  When I did stuff wrong, I got my butt whipped, the coaches whipped my butt, they'd make me run till I threw up, and thank God they did or I'd have probably been in prison.
[02:04:04.384 --> 02:04:05.704]  These kids need discipline.
[02:04:05.704 --> 02:04:08.005]  And the social engineers, Dr. Spock and all them,
[02:04:08.325 --> 02:04:08.986]  They bragged!
[02:04:08.986 --> 02:04:09.766]  They knew!
[02:04:09.766 --> 02:04:11.688]  They knew what they were doing!
[02:04:11.688 --> 02:04:13.510]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:15.512]  This is no longer freedom.
[02:04:15.512 --> 02:04:17.374]  It's no longer producing character.
[02:04:17.374 --> 02:04:19.776]  It's about control.
[02:04:19.776 --> 02:04:21.077]  Producing control.
[02:04:21.077 --> 02:04:26.202]  So those in power, the teachers' union, the socialists running the Democratic Party,
[02:04:26.883 --> 02:04:28.164]  They control everyone.
[02:04:28.164 --> 02:04:32.706]  And whenever they want more control or more power, they create a crisis.
[02:04:32.706 --> 02:04:35.327]  They, you know, a bunch of people are killed.
[02:04:35.327 --> 02:04:36.567]  People are starving.
[02:04:36.567 --> 02:04:39.569]  They bring out God, roll out God for 20 minutes.
[02:04:39.569 --> 02:04:43.630]  Barack Obama's not going to let God be on the horizon.
[02:04:43.630 --> 02:04:46.031]  Watch how many times he refers to God in the second inaugural.
[02:04:46.031 --> 02:04:48.092]  No, he says we are not a Christian nation.
[02:04:48.092 --> 02:04:49.413]  God bless you, sir.
[02:04:49.413 --> 02:04:51.574]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:51.574 --> 02:04:53.114]  The battle for the Republic is now.
[02:04:53.114 --> 02:04:53.875]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[02:04:54.355 --> 02:04:55.095]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:55.095 --> 02:04:55.955]  Keep up the fight.
[02:04:55.955 --> 02:04:56.496]  I will, sir.
[02:04:56.496 --> 02:04:56.876]  You too.
[02:04:56.876 --> 02:05:00.917]  We'll be right back with masses of key information.
[02:05:00.917 --> 02:05:03.937]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:05:03.937 --> 02:05:08.938]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:05:08.938 --> 02:05:16.120]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:21.906]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:05:21.906 --> 02:05:25.930]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:05:25.930 --> 02:05:30.655]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:05:30.655 --> 02:05:35.881]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:05:36.081 --> 02:05:39.343]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Scalzin.
[02:05:39.343 --> 02:05:41.845]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:05:41.845 --> 02:05:46.609]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:05:46.609 --> 02:05:49.491]  Hand cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[02:05:49.491 --> 02:05:56.696]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our Info War possible.
[02:05:56.696 --> 02:05:57.977]  We're getting prepared.
[02:05:57.977 --> 02:05:58.637]  Are you?
[02:05:58.637 --> 02:05:59.438]  InfoWarshop.com
[02:06:01.139 --> 02:06:05.241]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[02:06:05.241 --> 02:06:06.462]  Don't be one of them!
[02:06:06.462 --> 02:06:12.164]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.
[02:06:12.164 --> 02:06:21.969]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound healing.
[02:06:21.969 --> 02:06:28.632]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases.
[02:06:28.752 --> 02:06:29.152]  I think so.
[02:06:58.732 --> 02:07:00.693]  Yes, on Facebook.
[02:07:00.693 --> 02:07:06.196]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:07:06.196 --> 02:07:08.618]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:07:08.618 --> 02:07:17.723]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:17.723 --> 02:07:21.165]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:07:21.165 --> 02:07:22.846]  There's no priming required.
[02:07:22.846 --> 02:07:25.127]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[02:07:25.127 --> 02:07:27.028]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride
[02:07:27.168 --> 02:07:27.648]  We're good to go.
[02:07:55.777 --> 02:08:02.822]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:08:02.822 --> 02:08:08.826]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:08.826 --> 02:08:14.130]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:14.130 --> 02:08:22.856]  Alright, we've had listeners begging for this.
[02:08:24.153 --> 02:08:25.814]  More than anything I've probably ever seen.
[02:08:25.814 --> 02:08:29.797]  Because I know at a sick level it's entertaining.
[02:08:29.797 --> 02:08:32.599]  But it's also revealing.
[02:08:32.599 --> 02:08:36.101]  And the incredible thing is we sit here and talk about them and they still call in.
[02:08:36.101 --> 02:08:39.043]  But some of them have a halfway valid point.
[02:08:39.043 --> 02:08:41.825]  They go, look, I don't like Mitt Romney.
[02:08:41.825 --> 02:08:42.725]  I know he's evil.
[02:08:42.725 --> 02:08:43.746]  I know Obama's evil.
[02:08:43.746 --> 02:08:45.527]  He's a lesser of two evils.
[02:08:45.527 --> 02:08:50.691]  But those are people that have, in my view, a fallacy in their understanding.
[02:08:51.411 --> 02:09:02.676]  And they don't understand what we're saying, but when you get real Obama supporters calling in, they say, you're racist, you're bad, you know, basically the talking points, but they really believe it.
[02:09:02.676 --> 02:09:10.999]  I mean, they're freaked out, they're mad, they think I'm trying to keep them from some wonderful world under collectivism, under the eugenicist.
[02:09:10.999 --> 02:09:13.220]  Because this isn't just collectivism.
[02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:15.441]  It's eugenics-run collectivism.
[02:09:15.441 --> 02:09:19.883]  But see, all collectivism in the last 200 years has been eugenics-run.
[02:09:21.175 --> 02:09:27.939]  Because the British government ran this big empire and they made a big study on record with a whole bunch of different scientists.
[02:09:27.939 --> 02:09:32.741]  That's why all the major sciences came out of eugenics the last 160 years.
[02:09:32.741 --> 02:09:33.942]  We cover this in the film Endgame.
[02:09:33.942 --> 02:09:34.682]  It's free online.
[02:09:34.682 --> 02:09:36.023]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:09:37.250 --> 02:09:39.971]  That's the key to understanding what's happening.
[02:09:39.971 --> 02:09:42.893]  That they wanted to domesticate people.
[02:09:42.893 --> 02:09:45.774]  And basically create a false reality.
[02:09:45.774 --> 02:09:50.837]  Create an artificial system where you can't think outside that box and never escape.
[02:09:50.837 --> 02:09:54.799]  Because they want that control box so they can reduce your numbers.
[02:09:54.799 --> 02:09:57.300]  And people say, well, they haven't done a very good job of it.
[02:09:57.300 --> 02:10:03.524]  There are different paths and different forces in the world.
[02:10:04.364 --> 02:10:05.005]  That's the thing.
[02:10:05.005 --> 02:10:06.446]  The globalists aren't all powerful.
[02:10:06.446 --> 02:10:12.592]  They will be if they get that global technocracy in place, which they're really pushing for.
[02:10:12.592 --> 02:10:14.073]  They could easily fail.
[02:10:14.073 --> 02:10:15.494]  They failed before.
[02:10:15.494 --> 02:10:16.695]  They admit they're behind.
[02:10:16.695 --> 02:10:19.758]  That's why they're working so hard right now.
[02:10:19.758 --> 02:10:21.620]  And some of you will go, well, there are too many people.
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:23.261]  Have you seen how dumb the general public is?
[02:10:24.139 --> 02:10:25.680]  Okay, but you need to understand something.
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:29.262]  Yes, there's truth to some of the eugenics argument.
[02:10:29.262 --> 02:10:33.824]  I've never really talked about this on air because it's such a complex issue and I want to make a whole film about it.
[02:10:33.824 --> 02:10:46.290]  But when you really look at it, they've been there sabotaging things all the way, doing things that actually increase the population and increased the population's
[02:10:51.875 --> 02:10:58.999]  Systems, forms of their systems to where it was more destructive on the environment.
[02:10:58.999 --> 02:11:14.086]  It's incredibly complex and I shouldn't even have gotten off into all this because the point is they're trying to dumb people down and they want more dumb people than smart people until they get control and then they're going to wipe almost everybody out.
[02:11:15.342 --> 02:11:16.623]  It's all divide and conquer.
[02:11:16.623 --> 02:11:19.286]  It's all play nation-states off against each other.
[02:11:19.286 --> 02:11:21.488]  Races, religions off against each other.
[02:11:21.488 --> 02:11:24.290]  It's all a destabilization program.
[02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:26.292]  I forgot to get Corsi's take on Benghazi.
[02:11:26.292 --> 02:11:29.735]  We sent him back up next week for 30 minutes just on Benghazi.
[02:11:29.735 --> 02:11:31.076]  I forgot to get to that.
[02:11:31.076 --> 02:11:33.238]  The point is, is that it all goes back to eugenics.
[02:11:36.513 --> 02:11:40.595]  You know, the government is attacking and going after smart people.
[02:11:40.595 --> 02:11:50.381]  You have to understand that eugenics is sold to yuppies and to intelligentsia like, hey, there's too many dumb people and they cost too much money.
[02:11:50.381 --> 02:11:53.103]  Let's go ahead and abort all their kids and get rid of them.
[02:11:53.103 --> 02:11:55.224]  You know, it's the humane thing to do.
[02:11:55.224 --> 02:11:57.585]  Let's tell people we're liberals, we're really eugenicists.
[02:11:57.585 --> 02:11:58.606]  Okay, we'll do that.
[02:11:58.606 --> 02:11:59.326]  No, I understand.
[02:11:59.326 --> 02:12:01.027]  Act non-threatening.
[02:12:01.027 --> 02:12:01.488]  Exactly.
[02:12:01.488 --> 02:12:02.668]  Sneak up on them.
[02:12:02.668 --> 02:12:03.429]  All right, let's do that.
[02:12:04.562 --> 02:12:15.316]  Meanwhile, the entire system, as if that isn't bad enough, is really targeted at smart people who aren't part of the power structure, or a surplus of smart people.
[02:12:15.316 --> 02:12:21.123]  Or a surplus of aggressive people who they use to project their force, but who they fear.
[02:12:22.563 --> 02:12:29.307]  So like a cannon after a war, they decommission and spike and cut up into pieces and melt down.
[02:12:29.307 --> 02:12:31.649]  They do that to our military after they've used you.
[02:12:31.649 --> 02:12:36.232]  And now they're just going towards robots and drones where you're not even needed.
[02:12:36.232 --> 02:12:37.713]  And then they write books!
[02:12:37.713 --> 02:12:44.197]  You know, the heads of the big computer companies write books and articles in Wired Magazine how they're doing it to you.
[02:12:44.197 --> 02:12:46.819]  I mean, it's not my opinion is what's frustrating about this.
[02:12:48.132 --> 02:12:58.729]  I would have rather gone in the last hundred years, truly industrialize the third world equitably, to try to build up a system, have technology export that actually built up the first world.
[02:13:00.510 --> 02:13:06.614]  While empowering the third world, you know, basically no federal welfare, only local welfare.
[02:13:06.614 --> 02:13:15.000]  I mean, I've studied economic systems at work, but those systems create high education, true education, not indoctrination.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.964]  Of course, the more education we get, the dumber we get, the more ignorant.
[02:13:19.964 --> 02:13:23.766]  Again, I just, I said I'd take Obama calls, then I just go off into a trillion different issues.
[02:13:25.586 --> 02:13:27.686]  I really want good things for humanity.
[02:13:27.686 --> 02:13:29.467]  I really have studied history.
[02:13:29.467 --> 02:13:30.387]  And it's not hard.
[02:13:30.387 --> 02:13:34.968]  It's not like I have my opinion about what works and they have their opinion about what works.
[02:13:34.968 --> 02:13:37.988]  They don't want collectivism to empower you.
[02:13:37.988 --> 02:13:54.551]  They want collectivism so they have you under their control paying your electric bill and paying for your tiny house, your Agenda 21 jail cell, so that they can dictate you're going to take shots that are going to actuary when you die to kill you early.
[02:13:55.817 --> 02:14:06.141]  And so they can fully control your life and use you and expend you as a cog because they are a religion, the priest of power.
[02:14:06.141 --> 02:14:12.903]  Their whole religion is about organizing groups of people.
[02:14:12.903 --> 02:14:14.843]  And I don't like it.
[02:14:14.843 --> 02:14:15.884]  And I don't like them.
[02:14:15.884 --> 02:14:20.725]  I mean, these globalists are very, very sick people.
[02:14:20.725 --> 02:14:24.847]  And it is the ultimate sin in the British Commission on Population.
[02:14:26.212 --> 02:14:29.507]  I'm gonna give the number out only for Obama supporters here in a moment.
[02:14:29.507 --> 02:14:30.894]  They can call in on their Obama phones.
[02:14:37.325 --> 02:14:43.711]  I'll just go ahead and give the number out now, because I'll keep pontificating and the whole hour will go by and I've got a bunch of news to get to and some incredible videos we're going to premiere.
[02:14:43.711 --> 02:14:45.432]  One of them is absolutely amazing.
[02:14:45.432 --> 02:14:51.718]  I hope you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, but for radio listeners, it will be posted later this afternoon at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:14:51.718 --> 02:14:53.159]  I want to get it out to everybody.
[02:14:53.159 --> 02:14:56.742]  Tune in to the featured video on the YouTube channel and it will be on HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:15:00.399 --> 02:15:06.382]  You know, how am I going to save the fluoride heads that have probably had 150 shots in their life?
[02:15:06.382 --> 02:15:15.866]  You know, let's say an average 30-year-old inner-city woman, black, white, Hispanic, probably had 150 shots on average, been drinking higher levels of fluoride.
[02:15:15.866 --> 02:15:21.328]  They've done national studies where in the minority areas it's a lot higher, because they're putting it even higher in your area.
[02:15:21.328 --> 02:15:24.289]  And that's how actuaried out this is, folks.
[02:15:24.289 --> 02:15:27.811]  And the people in the Water District don't ask questions, they're just told to distribute it this way.
[02:15:28.834 --> 02:15:31.217]  That's why some have blown the whistle.
[02:15:31.217 --> 02:15:42.130]  See, I was able, five years ago, to start beating the drum about how they're adding radioactive isotopes in the so-called sodium fluoride from the phosphate mines.
[02:15:42.130 --> 02:15:45.274]  It's toxic waste they'd have to store, so they make you pay for it.
[02:15:45.274 --> 02:15:46.916]  Some cities, millions a year, like Austin.
[02:15:48.408 --> 02:16:03.832]  And I knew in the studies that the stuff they buy out of Florida, the stuff they buy out of Colorado, the stuff they buy out of Mongolia, China, is full of five or six different radioactive isotopes.
[02:16:03.832 --> 02:16:06.672]  I mean, you want kidney cancer?
[02:16:06.672 --> 02:16:08.673]  You want bladder cancer?
[02:16:08.673 --> 02:16:09.473]  Baby, get ready.
[02:16:11.795 --> 02:16:16.276]  I mean, in some studies it gives you over 50 times chance of getting, and that's why that's all off the chart.
[02:16:16.276 --> 02:16:35.403]  So I just get up here, did reports, talked about it, read the ingredients, took me probably 30, 40 times talking about it to get, suddenly local newscasts all over the country, you can look these up, would go and would stick a Geiger counter up against the pipes, and they would just go off the chart, and the government spun it, oh, it must be radiation in the aquifer.
[02:16:35.403 --> 02:16:38.984]  Which is true, they're mining limestone for phosphates,
[02:16:39.878 --> 02:16:43.660]  Where they didn't take the toxic waste derivative and put it in our water.
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:48.782]  It's the same thing that's in some of the aquifers, but in very low levels.
[02:16:48.782 --> 02:16:53.585]  So see, their spin... I tried my hardest to make sure you wouldn't get killed, but I can't.
[02:16:53.585 --> 02:16:54.185]  I can't help you.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.263]  Because they're just going to hit you with a disinfo law.
[02:16:57.263 --> 02:16:58.304]  The feds all come in.
[02:16:58.304 --> 02:17:00.346]  It turned out Rick Perry made it secret.
[02:17:00.346 --> 02:17:03.410]  As soon as I started exposing it, signed an executive order.
[02:17:03.410 --> 02:17:11.218]  In fact, it was an executive directive to keep the findings, because the state started investigating when I talked about it.
[02:17:11.218 --> 02:17:13.421]  And Perry just put an order on it, blocking it out.
[02:17:13.421 --> 02:17:14.863]  Then folks blew the whistle inside.
[02:17:16.184 --> 02:17:19.827]  There are good people in government corporations, they just don't have intelligence.
[02:17:19.827 --> 02:17:25.151]  And by intelligence, I don't mean native electrochemical intelligence in their cerebral cortex.
[02:17:25.151 --> 02:17:27.052]  I mean, they don't know.
[02:17:27.052 --> 02:17:29.694]  They would never give people radioactive isotopes.
[02:17:29.694 --> 02:17:31.716]  So they hear me, they go, this guy's crazy.
[02:17:31.716 --> 02:17:36.900]  They go stick a Geiger counter up to it and to a bag of fluoride coming in out of China.
[02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:41.483]  And it's, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 times.
[02:17:41.483 --> 02:17:43.645]  I mean, it's pegging the meters.
[02:17:43.645 --> 02:17:44.626]  It's Chernobyl.
[02:17:48.089 --> 02:17:51.592]  And now you see the newscast, yeah, our water's radioactive in Austin.
[02:17:51.592 --> 02:17:52.232]  We don't know why.
[02:17:52.232 --> 02:17:53.253]  Oh, don't worry about it.
[02:17:53.253 --> 02:17:56.235]  Our water, all outside Austin's, oh, it's radioactive in Houston.
[02:17:56.235 --> 02:17:57.796]  It's radioactive in San Antonio.
[02:17:57.796 --> 02:18:00.238]  It's radioactive, all over the country, radioactive.
[02:18:00.238 --> 02:18:03.040]  Even when you're not even getting it from aquifers, they're like, well, how is this happening?
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:04.421]  We're getting it out of a lake.
[02:18:04.421 --> 02:18:06.182]  They're adding it.
[02:18:06.182 --> 02:18:07.443]  They're adding it.
[02:18:07.443 --> 02:18:08.844]  And it's on record they're adding it.
[02:18:11.096 --> 02:18:20.319]  I mean, it's like, how do you, and it's the same thing with Obama supporters.
[02:18:20.319 --> 02:18:24.240]  I get up here and criticize Obama, they think I'm saying I'm for Mitt Romney.
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:24.700]  No!
[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:28.921]  The fix was in, like a Don King boxing match, that that's the winner!
[02:18:28.921 --> 02:18:29.941]  That's the puppet!
[02:18:29.941 --> 02:18:30.941]  That's the guy!
[02:18:30.941 --> 02:18:31.862]  That's what he's gonna do!
[02:18:31.862 --> 02:18:40.204]  And then, but then they still tear down Liberty by having Romney claim he's for good things, so that can be discredited through fraud, so he won't defend it.
[02:18:42.362 --> 02:18:47.647]  So see, then it forces you to defend Romney when he's saying, no, small businesses did build America.
[02:18:47.647 --> 02:18:50.189]  But he's still a bad guy, but I'm forced to defend him.
[02:18:50.189 --> 02:18:53.312]  And then you hear that, and you go, oh, you're defending Romney.
[02:18:53.312 --> 02:18:58.216]  Listen, I'm not defending Romney when I tell you there's radiation being put in your water, radioactive isotopes.
[02:18:58.216 --> 02:19:06.283]  See, this is what's so crazy about this, is can you grasp that in your brains if you're an Obama supporter, or if you're a right-winger or whatever?
[02:19:07.136 --> 02:19:08.877]  Do you understand the fix is in?
[02:19:08.877 --> 02:19:11.558]  Do you get that through your head?
[02:19:11.558 --> 02:19:18.361]  The system wants to suck the energy out of you while they get ready to go to the next wave robotic system.
[02:19:18.361 --> 02:19:20.222]  They don't need us anymore.
[02:19:20.222 --> 02:19:24.964]  They say, you used to be cheap, life used to be cheap, now you're a negative.
[02:19:24.964 --> 02:19:34.249]  And Brzezinski, in a speech he gave a few months ago, you can pull it up, said, I saw it even quoted in the news, he said, 20 years ago, to paraphrase, let me find the exact quote, he goes, it was easier
[02:19:35.151 --> 02:19:42.193]  To just spend a million dollars or a billion dollars to brainwash people to follow what you said.
[02:19:42.193 --> 02:19:47.634]  Now it's just cheaper to kill them.
[02:19:47.634 --> 02:19:51.755]  See, this is what I'm trying to get across to you folks.
[02:19:51.755 --> 02:19:53.075]  You're under attack.
[02:19:53.075 --> 02:19:55.536]  800, I'll give the number, I'll come back.
[02:19:55.536 --> 02:19:56.196]  800-259-9231, Obama supporters.
[02:20:01.161 --> 02:20:02.583]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.583 --> 02:20:13.257]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:20:13.257 --> 02:20:17.343]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:20:17.703 --> 02:20:20.447]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:20:20.447 --> 02:20:31.721]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:20:31.721 --> 02:20:34.885]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:20:35.205 --> 02:20:41.348]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:41.348 --> 02:20:51.252]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:20:51.252 --> 02:20:52.733]  The war is here.
[02:20:52.733 --> 02:20:54.633]  It's an info war.
[02:20:54.633 --> 02:20:56.694]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:02.298 --> 02:21:04.519]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[02:21:04.519 --> 02:21:09.600]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:11.421]  This is really scary stuff.
[02:21:11.421 --> 02:21:16.683]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.
[02:21:16.683 --> 02:21:23.865]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[02:21:24.725 --> 02:21:27.506]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[02:21:27.506 --> 02:21:31.288]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[02:21:31.288 --> 02:21:39.851]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[02:21:39.851 --> 02:21:49.995]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[02:21:50.735 --> 02:21:56.060]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[02:21:56.060 --> 02:21:58.082]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[02:21:59.969 --> 02:22:06.652]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:06.652 --> 02:22:14.775]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:14.775 --> 02:22:22.598]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:22.938 --> 02:22:28.022]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.022 --> 02:22:33.246]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.246 --> 02:22:37.590]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:38.671]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:38.671 --> 02:22:43.195]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:43.195 --> 02:22:48.099]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:48.099 --> 02:22:50.601]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:23:52.602 --> 02:23:55.624]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:23:55.624 --> 02:23:56.885]  Protect your immune system.
[02:23:56.885 --> 02:23:57.926]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:04.215 --> 02:24:05.177]  Don't worry.
[02:24:05.177 --> 02:24:07.220]  This show is documented.
[02:24:07.220 --> 02:24:10.384]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:10.384 --> 02:24:16.253]  Yeah, if you type in, uh, radioactive isotopes found in water supplies...
[02:24:17.889 --> 02:24:22.051]  You'll see newscasts all over the country.
[02:24:22.051 --> 02:24:35.316]  And guys also type in, as I mentioned, it's been a while since I covered this, type in Rick Perry covered up radiation in water or Rick Perry ordered radiation and water cover up.
[02:24:35.316 --> 02:24:44.040]  And again, my point is we're able to get a story out and go, by the way, they're putting radiation and radioactive isotopes in your water.
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:47.001]  We're able to get that out, but then they just give it a cover story.
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:51.282]  I mean, we know where it's coming from, and they have all these investigations.
[02:24:51.282 --> 02:24:52.243]  Where is it coming from?
[02:24:52.243 --> 02:24:53.284]  Where is it coming from?
[02:24:53.284 --> 02:25:01.851]  And they've got enough globalist managers out there that no newscast ever said, oh, it's in the bag of fluoride right here.
[02:25:01.851 --> 02:25:06.375]  When it's in government studies and state studies and federal studies, it's all known.
[02:25:10.413 --> 02:25:11.414]  And see, that's an example.
[02:25:11.414 --> 02:25:16.777]  You will take vaccines from government-controlled hospitals with a government that's been caught testing.
[02:25:16.777 --> 02:25:24.261]  Everybody knows about syphilis in black people because it was a big deal and came out, but there's like thousands of studies, thousands of things like that.
[02:25:24.261 --> 02:25:25.422]  Black, white, you name it.
[02:25:26.926 --> 02:25:32.567]  I mean, Obama is a globalist New World Order eugenicist.
[02:25:32.567 --> 02:25:33.248]  They all are.
[02:25:33.248 --> 02:25:39.729]  The point is they're going to use the leftist takeover of collectivism to get control of you so they can put whatever they want in your body.
[02:25:39.729 --> 02:25:46.631]  Obama supporters, 800-259-9231, they are feeling good right now.
[02:25:46.631 --> 02:25:48.431]  They're celebrating everywhere.
[02:25:48.431 --> 02:25:49.672]  The government's their friend.
[02:25:49.672 --> 02:25:50.852]  They've got a big ego now.
[02:25:51.769 --> 02:25:55.071]  They're under the dark wings of the New World Order.
[02:25:55.071 --> 02:25:59.033]  And let's talk to Mac in New Hampshire, who's an Obama supporter.
[02:25:59.033 --> 02:26:00.774]  Some of these will be sarcastic.
[02:26:00.774 --> 02:26:03.135]  Go ahead, Mac.
[02:26:03.135 --> 02:26:04.635]  Hey, why not, Alex?
[02:26:04.635 --> 02:26:06.516]  I mean, think about it.
[02:26:06.516 --> 02:26:13.100]  You sell gold for the New World Order, so why can't I support Obama?
[02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:14.580]  Okay, so I guess that's it.
[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:15.181]  I'm convicted.
[02:26:15.181 --> 02:26:18.603]  I sell gold for the New World Order.
[02:26:18.603 --> 02:26:20.543]  Who owns all the gold?
[02:26:20.543 --> 02:26:21.424]  The Rothschilds.
[02:26:22.887 --> 02:26:24.709]  Right?
[02:26:24.709 --> 02:26:29.152]  They own a lot of it, but they're trying to drive down the price of it and hoard it.
[02:26:29.152 --> 02:26:34.097]  They actually, openly, all the big mega banks and people want to keep gold down.
[02:26:34.097 --> 02:26:37.940]  So while they buy it, they're always bad-mouthing it.
[02:26:37.940 --> 02:26:44.265]  And I told people, buy gold at $260 an ounce, and then it doubled, tripled, quadrupled.
[02:26:44.265 --> 02:26:46.187]  I mean, I personally believe in gold and silver.
[02:26:46.187 --> 02:26:48.128]  I guess everything I do is bad.
[02:26:48.128 --> 02:26:50.971]  So that's why you support Obama.
[02:26:52.261 --> 02:26:53.702]  I'm not saying everything you do is bad.
[02:26:53.702 --> 02:26:54.542]  No, no, no.
[02:26:54.542 --> 02:26:54.842]  Hold on.
[02:26:54.842 --> 02:26:55.562]  No, no, no.
[02:26:55.562 --> 02:26:57.143]  It's a moral equivalency.
[02:26:57.143 --> 02:27:01.285]  You're saying I support Obama, I guess, because you think he gives you something free.
[02:27:01.285 --> 02:27:02.446]  I guess that's the message.
[02:27:02.446 --> 02:27:04.286]  And then you're saying I'm immoral.
[02:27:04.286 --> 02:27:14.531]  I sell gold when I have a sponsor, Midas Resources, where I get my gold, who has great deals on it, so that when the fiat currency goes belly up, people are prepared.
[02:27:14.531 --> 02:27:19.293]  See, I sell things I believe in to fund my operation because I try to be a moral person.
[02:27:19.293 --> 02:27:20.854]  So whatever I think's really hot,
[02:27:21.494 --> 02:27:28.341]  Like Pro Pure Water Filters, discounted at Infowarsstore.com or Midas Resources, you know, Franks or whatever.
[02:27:28.341 --> 02:27:30.083]  I promote the bullion.
[02:27:30.083 --> 02:27:35.248]  Even though sponsorship wise I could make more if I promoted the numismatics and there are some good deals on that.
[02:27:35.248 --> 02:27:37.570]  It's just hard to really know what you're doing.
[02:27:37.570 --> 02:27:38.511]  I promote bullion.
[02:27:39.352 --> 02:27:46.316]  Even though I have sponsors knocking my doors down to promote numismatics with 200% markups that other talk show hosts promote all day.
[02:27:46.316 --> 02:27:47.176]  Do you hear me do that?
[02:27:47.176 --> 02:27:47.676]  No, you don't.
[02:27:47.676 --> 02:27:51.378]  But the point is, you... So why do you like Obama?
[02:27:51.378 --> 02:27:52.439]  We've heard how I'm evil.
[02:27:52.439 --> 02:27:53.419]  Okay, I'm bad.
[02:27:53.419 --> 02:27:57.721]  Now, you tell us... You're telling you're in charge, aren't you?
[02:27:57.721 --> 02:28:01.223]  You kind of feel good about this big government right now, don't you?
[02:28:01.223 --> 02:28:03.684]  Well, I look at it this way.
[02:28:03.684 --> 02:28:05.325]  One way or the other I don't care.
[02:28:07.717 --> 02:28:12.380]  What's Obama gonna do that any other president hasn't done already to us?
[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:19.886]  Exactly, you're like, I'm old, I'm getting my government money, I'm just gonna laugh at it and that gives me power over it.
[02:28:19.886 --> 02:28:23.989]  Well, I mean, let's face it, every other president, right, has screwed up.
[02:28:25.034 --> 02:28:25.754]  Am I right?
[02:28:25.754 --> 02:28:26.435]  No, no, no.
[02:28:26.435 --> 02:28:31.617]  Since they murdered Kennedy and they were good and bad and he wasn't perfect, we've been run by foreign banks.
[02:28:31.617 --> 02:28:33.898]  So things are getting progressively worse.
[02:28:33.898 --> 02:28:35.419]  The president's a puppet.
[02:28:35.419 --> 02:28:37.540]  See, I can't get that through to you.
[02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:39.121]  We're in a foreign takeover.
[02:28:39.121 --> 02:28:40.841]  Do you know what they've done in Greece and places?
[02:28:40.841 --> 02:28:42.442]  They're going to do that here.
[02:28:42.442 --> 02:28:46.244]  You understand, you're going to end up not getting your money, your Social Security, down this road.
[02:28:47.196 --> 02:28:48.158]  Let me ask you this.
[02:28:48.158 --> 02:28:51.063]  If you think any president was ever good, right?
[02:28:51.063 --> 02:28:59.018]  Then how come you never mention on your radio show that the Constitution was suspended in 1933 and no one's ever re-suspended it?
[02:28:59.775 --> 02:29:01.456]  How come you never mention that?
[02:29:01.456 --> 02:29:03.357]  Sir, that's in my films.
[02:29:03.357 --> 02:29:04.677]  The Emergency Powers Act of 1933.
[02:29:04.677 --> 02:29:08.179]  And that's when they put us under emergency.
[02:29:08.179 --> 02:29:10.600]  And that every year they reenact the emergency.
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:13.962]  And that we've had martial law since then as a beachhead.
[02:29:13.962 --> 02:29:17.024]  And that they've been slowly turning the heat up.
[02:29:17.024 --> 02:29:19.705]  Back then we were about a number one at martial law on the Richter scale.
[02:29:19.705 --> 02:29:21.166]  Now we're about a seven and a half.
[02:29:21.166 --> 02:29:22.707]  I've written articles about our show.
[02:29:22.707 --> 02:29:24.828]  I guess you must have missed that show.
[02:29:24.828 --> 02:29:27.949]  And do you ever tell anybody that we live under corporations?
[02:29:27.949 --> 02:29:29.330]  That we don't live under a government?
[02:29:30.126 --> 02:29:30.847]  But wait a minute.
[02:29:30.847 --> 02:29:32.668]  I talk about this constantly.
[02:29:32.668 --> 02:29:33.808]  He must be missing the show.
[02:29:33.808 --> 02:29:36.069]  But wait a minute.
[02:29:36.069 --> 02:29:38.211]  Why do you like Obama?
[02:29:38.211 --> 02:29:39.731]  Just because you think you're going to get more goodies?
[02:29:39.731 --> 02:29:43.293]  I mean, why do you support Obama?
[02:29:43.293 --> 02:29:48.016]  He's not going to do anything more than any other president has ever done.
[02:29:48.016 --> 02:29:48.996]  Are you kidding?
[02:29:48.996 --> 02:29:50.257]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.257 --> 02:29:51.658]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.658 --> 02:29:54.179]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.179 --> 02:29:56.861]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.961 --> 02:30:11.086]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[02:31:05.006 --> 02:31:06.247]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:06.247 --> 02:31:10.190]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:12.432]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.432 --> 02:31:18.296]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:18.296 --> 02:31:24.541]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.941 --> 02:31:30.904]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.904 --> 02:31:35.106]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:35.106 --> 02:31:39.409]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.409 --> 02:31:45.352]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:45.352 --> 02:31:48.894]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.894 --> 02:31:50.875]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.875 --> 02:31:51.315]  It's here.

[02:33:33.687 --> 02:33:36.227]  Texas man arrested for filming cop.
[02:33:36.227 --> 02:33:42.049]  Officer says, I need to see ID in case this ends up on YouTube and arrest him for filming.
[02:33:42.049 --> 02:33:44.030]  That video is up at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:47.631]  TSA denies using drone at Vikings Packers game.
[02:33:47.631 --> 02:33:49.932]  Does not comment on roaming Viper agents.
[02:33:51.239 --> 02:33:52.102]  Unbelievable.
[02:33:52.102 --> 02:33:56.738]  Washington Free Beacon reports radiation leak at Iran's nuke site.
[02:33:58.186 --> 02:34:00.127]  That is just some of the news.
[02:34:00.127 --> 02:34:02.509]  I want to go back to the Obama supporters.
[02:34:02.509 --> 02:34:04.330]  You know, that's what I found.
[02:34:04.330 --> 02:34:06.571]  They just have an arrogance.
[02:34:06.571 --> 02:34:08.832]  And, ah, he's alright.
[02:34:08.832 --> 02:34:11.814]  And they like how he talks, and they like his baloney.
[02:34:11.814 --> 02:34:12.955]  Will you queue up?
[02:34:12.955 --> 02:34:14.096]  I forgot to tell you this.
[02:34:14.096 --> 02:34:20.920]  The Obama clip where he pledged not to raise taxes on payroll taxes or any other taxes on people below a quarter million dollars a year.
[02:34:22.108 --> 02:34:36.574]  Because there's like 14 different new taxes, fines, fees, and I was covering it yesterday, 14 different ones out of the new Congress that he robo-signed yesterday.
[02:34:36.574 --> 02:34:38.375]  And $12 billion in cuts.
[02:34:38.375 --> 02:34:40.136]  I mean, that's a joke.
[02:34:40.136 --> 02:34:41.417]  They want to bankrupt us.
[02:34:41.417 --> 02:34:44.318]  They're not screwing up in Washington.
[02:34:44.318 --> 02:34:44.858]  Let's go ahead.
[02:34:44.858 --> 02:34:47.859]  I mean, I should have played this for that Obama supporter.
[02:34:47.859 --> 02:34:49.260]  I mean, do you like being lied to?
[02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:51.381]  And they go, that's just the way I'll do it.
[02:34:53.186 --> 02:34:56.249]  Well, why the Democrats get so upset about drones and killing and wars?
[02:34:56.249 --> 02:34:57.930]  Yeah, I got upset when Bush was doing it.
[02:34:57.930 --> 02:34:59.051]  I'm upset now, you know?
[02:34:59.051 --> 02:35:03.575]  Because, see, that's being done in my name, and my tax money is going to do that.
[02:35:03.575 --> 02:35:06.977]  So I feel responsible.
[02:35:06.977 --> 02:35:08.679]  So, I mean, I feel bad about it.
[02:35:09.989 --> 02:35:14.193]  I can't control some Prozac head who stole guns from Mommy and goes and kills people.
[02:35:14.193 --> 02:35:19.758]  The folks that put him on the drugs in the schools, the people that push all this and know it's going to happen, I don't like them.
[02:35:19.758 --> 02:35:21.339]  They're the ones that helped this happen.
[02:35:21.339 --> 02:35:27.465]  But I'm not guilty for Adam Lanza because I want to protect my family and my Second Amendment birthright!
[02:35:30.145 --> 02:35:34.546]  Let me tell you something, I do share some of the blame for not doing enough to stop these wars and things.
[02:35:34.546 --> 02:35:40.127]  And then just to watch you Democrats who would get so upset about Bush, because it was just moral power for you.
[02:35:40.127 --> 02:35:42.388]  Now when Obama does it, you love it.
[02:35:42.388 --> 02:35:43.508]  I see them defend it.
[02:35:43.508 --> 02:35:48.289]  I put a video out showing kids Obama killed with drones and they were like, good, kill him.
[02:35:48.289 --> 02:35:49.309]  They were real Democrats.
[02:35:49.309 --> 02:35:50.529]  I mean, you're just sick.
[02:35:50.529 --> 02:35:56.891]  You think you're on a winning team when Obama is a front man for a guy putting fluoride in your drinking water.
[02:35:57.651 --> 02:35:59.412]  Putting cancer viruses in your vaccine.
[02:35:59.412 --> 02:36:03.013]  You know, you've been doing it a long time.
[02:36:03.013 --> 02:36:04.913]  You are living in fantasy land.
[02:36:04.913 --> 02:36:07.534]  I'm going to move quickly here through Obama supporters 800-259-9231.
[02:36:07.534 --> 02:36:11.895]  Then we've got our answer to demand a plan that's going to premiere here.
[02:36:11.895 --> 02:36:18.617]  It's pretty powerful audio and video that will be posted in the next few hours and in full wars.com for the radio listeners.
[02:36:18.617 --> 02:36:20.738]  Obama supporter listening on 90.1 FM in Austin.
[02:36:20.738 --> 02:36:21.318]  Go ahead.
[02:36:23.191 --> 02:36:23.931]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[02:36:23.931 --> 02:36:24.472]  Put him on hold.
[02:36:24.472 --> 02:36:28.233]  I forgot we have a station owner or manager who wanted to say something about Obama.
[02:36:28.233 --> 02:36:28.974]  I apologize.
[02:36:28.974 --> 02:36:29.914]  I'm out of control.
[02:36:29.914 --> 02:36:32.215]  I'm doing stuff during the breaks is the problem.
[02:36:32.215 --> 02:36:37.258]  Greg, I think his name is Lesher, operates 1540 AM KYAH.
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:42.420]  Yeah, 540.
[02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:45.082]  I'm so out of my mind, folks.
[02:36:45.082 --> 02:36:46.223]  Operates 540.
[02:36:46.223 --> 02:36:47.003]  You know what it is?
[02:36:47.003 --> 02:36:50.665]  We've got to move this TV closer to me with the calls, because I've got good eyes.
[02:36:50.665 --> 02:36:54.087]  But since we put it on a smaller monitor, I can't read.
[02:36:54.087 --> 02:36:55.528]  I mean, my eyes are going.
[02:36:55.528 --> 02:36:59.271]  I've always had, like, 20-15 vision, and I can't read this.
[02:36:59.271 --> 02:37:08.456]  Again, Greg operates 540 AM KYAH, another one of our great affiliates across the United States.
[02:37:08.456 --> 02:37:11.358]  Greg, what is your take today, sir, on all this?
[02:37:12.728 --> 02:37:15.590]  Okay, you're sitting down, I hope.
[02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:17.551]  I am sitting down, sir.
[02:37:17.551 --> 02:37:19.552]  Okay.
[02:37:19.552 --> 02:37:26.855]  You know, when a forest fire gets going, the best way that they fight it is create a backfire so they can burn up all the fuel.
[02:37:26.855 --> 02:37:33.719]  And they've done that with this birth certificate malarkey.
[02:37:33.719 --> 02:37:35.260]  Okay?
[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:38.361]  It doesn't matter where the man was born.
[02:37:38.361 --> 02:37:40.642]  He could have been born on the high seas.
[02:37:40.642 --> 02:37:41.643]  He understands this.
[02:37:42.577 --> 02:37:57.122]  But in order to qualify to be a candidate for the United States President, or to be the President, you have to have natural born citizens, both parents.
[02:37:57.122 --> 02:38:07.725]  And even according to the United Nations laws, because his father was a British citizen, he is a British citizen himself.
[02:38:08.826 --> 02:38:10.608]  Yes, he's a dual citizen, I knew that.
[02:38:10.608 --> 02:38:13.551]  No, actually, I knew that and it's never gotten attention.
[02:38:13.551 --> 02:38:21.518]  And the laws when he was born said you had to have both parents be citizens who were actually born here.
[02:38:21.518 --> 02:38:24.121]  They've since, I believe, changed the law going from memory.
[02:38:24.121 --> 02:38:29.566]  But no, he is illegitimate and they used the whole thing about where is he really from as a distraction.
[02:38:30.819 --> 02:38:33.581]  Yeah, no, the laws are not changed.
[02:38:33.581 --> 02:38:38.263]  You have to be a natural born citizen, or your parents at least have to be naturalized citizens.
[02:38:38.263 --> 02:38:39.724]  Both of them?
[02:38:39.724 --> 02:38:41.425]  Yes, both of them.
[02:38:41.425 --> 02:38:43.727]  It's in the Constitution.
[02:38:43.727 --> 02:38:44.387]  Okay?
[02:38:44.387 --> 02:38:45.808]  That's the way it is.
[02:38:45.808 --> 02:38:54.493]  No, no, you're right, but I believe at the time that was the law, and you're right, it's in the Constitution, I think they claim they have a law that changed it, but you're right, it's in the Constitution.
[02:38:54.493 --> 02:38:57.575]  You can't do that without a constitutional convention.
[02:38:58.677 --> 02:39:03.840]  Well, that's why they got this artificial birth certificate.
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:04.661]  That's not the issue.
[02:39:04.661 --> 02:39:06.162]  The issue isn't where he was born.
[02:39:06.162 --> 02:39:06.823]  It doesn't matter.
[02:39:06.823 --> 02:39:11.085]  As long as both your parents are citizens, you can be born on the high seas.
[02:39:11.085 --> 02:39:13.187]  You can be born in space.
[02:39:13.187 --> 02:39:15.949]  You are a natural born citizen.
[02:39:15.949 --> 02:39:20.071]  What we're talking about here is a native born.
[02:39:20.071 --> 02:39:22.793]  And that has nothing to do with the law.
[02:39:22.793 --> 02:39:24.575]  You have to be a natural born citizen.
[02:39:24.575 --> 02:39:26.376]  And here's what's happened.
[02:39:26.376 --> 02:39:28.037]  He has already served his four years.
[02:39:29.167 --> 02:39:31.769]  Now, we're in a critical time period.
[02:39:31.769 --> 02:39:33.211]  Very critical.
[02:39:33.211 --> 02:39:40.937]  Because tomorrow, Congress sits down and they go ahead with the election and accept it.
[02:39:40.937 --> 02:39:42.078]  Now, here's the deal.
[02:39:42.078 --> 02:39:47.904]  A Quo Warranto action has been started with the Attorney General.
[02:39:47.904 --> 02:39:53.929]  And people need to get behind this and get overnight letters to their Senators tonight.
[02:39:53.929 --> 02:39:54.509]  Today.
[02:39:54.509 --> 02:39:54.830]  Today.
[02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:56.151]  Before the Post Office closes.
[02:39:56.869 --> 02:39:57.189]  I don't think so.
[02:40:13.201 --> 02:40:21.388]  And actually, Team Law, Eric Madsen there at Team Law has actually quote warned two judges numerous times and got him off the bench.
[02:40:21.388 --> 02:40:23.449]  They understand... No, no, I'm aware of that.
[02:40:23.449 --> 02:40:28.734]  And again, John McCain was born on a ship in the Panama Canal, but both his parents were known to be U.S.
[02:40:28.734 --> 02:40:31.516]  citizens, so obviously he's a citizen.
[02:40:31.516 --> 02:40:39.382]  It's not where you're born, it's that you have parents that are both born in the United States, and it's the same thing.
[02:40:39.382 --> 02:40:40.984]  And you're right, that's been looked into.
[02:40:40.984 --> 02:40:42.285]  It was part of England.
[02:40:42.865 --> 02:40:49.809]  When he was born, and so his supposed dad, that makes him a British citizen.
[02:40:49.809 --> 02:41:00.856]  And up till now, nobody's done, they've investigated what has been done, and nothing has been brought into the proper venue until now.
[02:41:00.856 --> 02:41:09.081]  And once this gets started, and once these people send these things to their senators in Washington, because that's where they are right now, and overnight them,
[02:41:11.471 --> 02:41:18.115]  You know, your listeners, we could create truckloads of these and the Attorney General will be flooded with these.
[02:41:18.115 --> 02:41:20.976]  The Attorney General's job is basically done, okay?
[02:41:20.976 --> 02:41:31.763]  Because even if he refuses to proceed with this, Zane Gray, who started this, becomes the special prosecutor for the United States.
[02:41:32.583 --> 02:41:36.147]  And then it becomes the United States against Barack Obama.
[02:41:36.147 --> 02:41:38.349]  That's what the court document will read.
[02:41:38.349 --> 02:41:47.678]  And it will begin the core warrant action and there is no way that Obama can get out of it because he cannot argue the fact that he's already said his father was from Kenya.
[02:41:47.678 --> 02:41:49.180]  He's a Kenyan.
[02:41:49.180 --> 02:41:49.660]  Okay?
[02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:50.701]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:41:50.701 --> 02:41:54.285]  What are people, are people waking up there in Delta, Utah to what's going on?
[02:41:55.157 --> 02:41:55.918]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:55.918 --> 02:41:57.859]  We just had a two-hour program.
[02:41:57.859 --> 02:42:04.605]  We had Eric Madsen with Team Lawn, and by the way, Eric Madsen will be on with Butch Pot tonight on Call to Decision.
[02:42:04.605 --> 02:42:07.107]  We had a two-hour meeting, and Zane Gray was on there.
[02:42:07.107 --> 02:42:08.988]  We talked about this in great detail.
[02:42:08.988 --> 02:42:15.293]  I will actually send you that two-hour program if you want to put it on your website so people can listen to this.
[02:42:15.293 --> 02:42:18.296]  And, I mean, it's just fantastic.
[02:42:18.296 --> 02:42:20.818]  This is the time when we can stop the whole thing.
[02:42:20.818 --> 02:42:22.299]  We can get this man out of office.
[02:42:22.839 --> 02:42:27.422]  Because he will be going in there illegally, against the Constitution.
[02:42:27.422 --> 02:42:29.303]  He is not a citizen.
[02:42:29.303 --> 02:42:32.925]  Well I'll tell you what, I'll get your name and number.
[02:42:32.925 --> 02:42:34.987]  We appreciate you carrying the show.
[02:42:34.987 --> 02:42:37.708]  And maybe we should get those guys on as well.
[02:42:37.708 --> 02:42:39.870]  God bless you and I appreciate you calling in.
[02:42:39.870 --> 02:42:46.674]  I said I was going to go to Obama supporters here, but I wanted to hear from one of the station owners out there in Utah.
[02:42:46.674 --> 02:42:50.636]  Now let's go back to Karen, now in Texas, an Obama supporter.
[02:42:50.636 --> 02:42:51.677]  Go ahead ma'am, you're on the air.
[02:42:52.788 --> 02:43:03.075]  Okay, well, it was the Republicans that put these toll roads into Austin, and we were trying to fight that.
[02:43:03.075 --> 02:43:10.920]  And when I originally voted for Obama, we thought that he would keep us out of a war, okay?
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:16.224]  And we thought that maybe he was better than McCain.
[02:43:16.224 --> 02:43:19.386]  So now he ran against Mitt Romney.
[02:43:19.386 --> 02:43:22.328]  Well, they wouldn't let us vote for Ron Paul.
[02:43:23.386 --> 02:43:27.469]  And we didn't know who else to vote for, so what are we supposed to do?
[02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:30.651]  No, no, see, this is a reasonable Obama supporter calling in.
[02:43:30.651 --> 02:43:31.931]  No, no, I get it.
[02:43:31.931 --> 02:43:35.434]  The Republicans run horrible people, so you don't have a choice.
[02:43:35.434 --> 02:43:46.881]  The point is, Obama is really, really bad, is my point, because he gets away with the wars, he gets away with the torture, he gets away with everything, and they don't use him to bring people together.
[02:43:48.103 --> 02:43:49.984]  They used him to create division, Karen.
[02:43:49.984 --> 02:43:50.965]  I appreciate your call.
[02:43:50.965 --> 02:43:54.288]  And look, we get obsessed with personalities.
[02:43:54.288 --> 02:44:04.536]  My point is that the Obama supporters that cheerlead for Obama, and who really think he's like a movie star, and go, ah, and I'm like, listen, he's really bad.
[02:44:04.536 --> 02:44:05.857]  Oh, you just lost.
[02:44:05.857 --> 02:44:06.898]  That's who we're talking about.
[02:44:07.498 --> 02:44:12.181]  Those are people that are really dangerous because they're so stupid.
[02:44:12.181 --> 02:44:14.422]  And that's who we're wanting to talk to, I'll be honest with you.
[02:44:14.422 --> 02:44:15.923]  We had one earlier.
[02:44:15.923 --> 02:44:18.084]  Joe in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:44:18.084 --> 02:44:20.525]  Hello?
[02:44:20.525 --> 02:44:22.226]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:44:22.226 --> 02:44:23.407]  Oh, sorry about that.
[02:44:23.407 --> 02:44:28.069]  First things first, I would just like everybody to research an A.D.
[02:44:28.069 --> 02:44:33.252]  psy-op created called Mind Wars, and how Info Wars is a manifestation of that.
[02:44:34.813 --> 02:44:42.928]  Now sir, now sir, obviously I use the term InfoWars.com to say the global issues information lies against us.
[02:44:42.928 --> 02:44:43.890]  We use truth.
[02:44:44.827 --> 02:44:45.848]  against them.
[02:44:45.848 --> 02:44:51.750]  See, like the word propaganda just means information to get something political done you want.
[02:44:51.750 --> 02:44:53.951]  Black propaganda means lies.
[02:44:53.951 --> 02:44:55.512]  White propaganda means truth.
[02:44:55.512 --> 02:44:57.633]  Gray propaganda means spin.
[02:44:57.633 --> 02:45:03.055]  I use white propaganda, so I want to be clear about terms out there.
[02:45:03.055 --> 02:45:07.497]  When I talk about gun violence lowering after gun ownership,
[02:45:08.562 --> 02:45:11.588]  Increases and I have the FBI statistics.
[02:45:11.588 --> 02:45:13.511]  That's white propaganda.
[02:45:13.511 --> 02:45:16.136]  Okay, so I want to be specific about that.
[02:45:16.136 --> 02:45:16.456]  Go ahead
[02:45:17.378 --> 02:45:22.020]  I understand that, and the message, certainly use the term, bear fruits.
[02:45:22.020 --> 02:45:26.563]  The message, the fruit that is bared from the message is certainly true.
[02:45:26.563 --> 02:45:29.825]  But what I'd like to point out is that you have to be careful.
[02:45:29.825 --> 02:45:38.189]  A lot of the times in the entertainment industry especially, 75% of the truth is reported, with 15% careful... Listen, I agree with you.
[02:45:38.189 --> 02:45:41.150]  Listen, we're taking calls from Obama supporters.
[02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:43.952]  Tell us, do you support Obama, or is that a way to get on the air?
[02:45:44.969 --> 02:45:46.870]  No, I do have a point about Obama.
[02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:52.713]  Now, you have to be completely unaware of the situation, what's really going on with the politics.
[02:45:52.713 --> 02:45:55.855]  Whether you're for or against Obama is irrelevant.
[02:45:55.855 --> 02:46:01.738]  If you go by the fruits of what their actions bear, you'd have to be an idiot to support them.
[02:46:01.738 --> 02:46:07.841]  All we're seeing the government do is wars, and we're seeing corruption, and robbery of taxpayers.
[02:46:07.841 --> 02:46:12.203]  Obama is merely... That's what you should focus more on, and I do agree with that.
[02:46:12.443 --> 02:46:14.663]  Well, the globalists wanted Obama.
[02:46:14.663 --> 02:46:15.424]  Why is that?
[02:46:15.424 --> 02:46:21.105]  See, if the globalists want to open borders, I can intellectually tell you why it's bad, but I just automatically am against it.
[02:46:21.105 --> 02:46:25.605]  If the globalists want our guns, I can tell you intellectually why I'm against it, but they're against it.
[02:46:25.605 --> 02:46:27.366]  I'm against them.
[02:46:27.366 --> 02:46:30.146]  You see, I'm pro-gun because they're anti-gun.
[02:46:30.146 --> 02:46:32.086]  I'm pro-sovereignty because they're anti-sovereignty.
[02:46:32.086 --> 02:46:33.607]  And I have all my reasons for that.
[02:46:33.607 --> 02:46:34.947]  They have their reasons.
[02:46:34.947 --> 02:46:36.047]  I don't know what you're getting at, Joe.
[02:46:36.047 --> 02:46:37.547]  I appreciate your call.
[02:46:37.547 --> 02:46:39.988]  I mean, these Obama supporters just...
[02:46:40.848 --> 02:46:41.528]  God bless them.
[02:46:41.528 --> 02:46:51.374]  I mean, you know Republicans are pretty dumbed down as well, but at least they say they want smaller government and no collectivism ruins people.
[02:46:51.374 --> 02:46:55.677]  And the Republicans are just, you know, basically the other side of the system and they just move forward as well.
[02:46:56.539 --> 02:46:59.540]  But, I mean, Democrats, I mean, it's about being part of a club.
[02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:04.161]  It's about having the Obama sticker and people go, oh, you're liberal, you're good.
[02:47:04.161 --> 02:47:14.945]  No, you support a front guy, a pitch man, for a globalist operation feeding us GMO and fluoride and cancer viruses and the vaccines and radioactive isotopes in the water.
[02:47:15.942 --> 02:47:18.384]  And launching wars all over the place.
[02:47:18.384 --> 02:47:21.487]  And I have Obama supporters, I go, listen, these wars are wrong, in person.
[02:47:21.487 --> 02:47:23.249]  And they go, you're just sad you lost.
[02:47:23.249 --> 02:47:27.713]  And I'm like, no, no, listen, they're expanding wars, it's really bad.
[02:47:27.713 --> 02:47:30.215]  Oh yeah, you wish Romney would've won, would he have been better?
[02:47:30.215 --> 02:47:34.459]  And I'm like, you need to recognize it's wrong what Obama's doing.
[02:47:34.459 --> 02:47:35.260]  Can you at least do that?
[02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:36.060]  And they go, no!
[02:47:37.168 --> 02:47:39.788]  You're just trying to use that against him because you don't like him.
[02:47:39.788 --> 02:47:41.449]  I'm just like, oh man.
[02:47:41.449 --> 02:47:43.609]  And it's the helplessness of them.
[02:47:43.609 --> 02:47:46.630]  Jamie in New Mexico, Obama supporter.
[02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:49.230]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:47:49.230 --> 02:47:50.630]  Yes.
[02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:53.351]  First time caller, long time listener.
[02:47:53.351 --> 02:48:01.692]  I am forced to support Obama because I am living off of welfare and food stamps.
[02:48:01.692 --> 02:48:04.513]  It is real easy to get food stamps.
[02:48:05.863 --> 02:48:10.265]  Depending on your employer, it's really easy to get unemployment benefits.
[02:48:10.265 --> 02:48:20.548]  I'm making about $100 less than I was, and right now it's a good thing because I'd probably be on the streets, I'd probably be living with my mom, or my brother.
[02:48:21.178 --> 02:48:29.702]  You realize with 50 million people on food stamps it destroys all the small businesses because only the big businesses are designed to take the money and the cards.
[02:48:29.702 --> 02:48:31.803]  And you understand in the end you're going to get nothing.
[02:48:31.803 --> 02:48:32.563]  I mean you understand.
[02:48:32.563 --> 02:48:36.745]  Have you heard my story of how you domesticate hogs?
[02:48:36.745 --> 02:48:40.527]  Bald hogs?
[02:48:40.527 --> 02:48:42.248]  It's only for this month.
[02:48:43.993 --> 02:48:45.854]  Because I'm looking for me to listen.
[02:48:45.854 --> 02:48:47.394]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[02:48:47.394 --> 02:48:50.715]  Listen, people are really down and out the churches or state government.
[02:48:50.715 --> 02:48:53.336]  There should be some form of safety net.
[02:48:53.336 --> 02:48:54.437]  This isn't a safety net.
[02:48:54.437 --> 02:48:55.977]  This is a safety news, sir.
[02:48:55.977 --> 02:48:57.278]  And and.
[02:48:59.474 --> 02:49:01.955]  Again, you say you support Obama.
[02:49:01.955 --> 02:49:07.776]  He's only doing all this to get you dependent so he can get the guns and then drop the hammer.
[02:49:07.776 --> 02:49:11.097]  They've already done this in Europe and Mexico and everywhere else.
[02:49:11.097 --> 02:49:15.059]  Just so long as you know it's a trap.
[02:49:15.059 --> 02:49:18.860]  Look, there are calories in a butterscotch candy.
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:22.361]  A small butterscotch candy probably has 50 calories, okay?
[02:49:22.361 --> 02:49:23.261]  Do you agree with me on that?
[02:49:25.273 --> 02:49:28.555]  Now, a butterscotch candy is not bad in and of itself.
[02:49:28.555 --> 02:49:38.602]  If a man opens a van door at a playground and tells a three-year-old his parents aren't watching him, get in the car, I got butterscotch, should the child get in the car for the butterscotch candy?
[02:49:38.602 --> 02:49:39.943]  Negative.
[02:49:39.943 --> 02:49:44.686]  But I mean, it's a free candy.
[02:49:44.686 --> 02:49:47.508]  I see your point.
[02:49:47.508 --> 02:49:52.731]  I was at the EBT, the food stamp place yesterday.
[02:49:52.731 --> 02:49:55.013]  People purposefully
[02:49:55.908 --> 02:49:58.089]  Have kids to get on welfare.
[02:49:58.089 --> 02:50:02.871]  People purposefully quit their jobs to get on unemployment.
[02:50:02.871 --> 02:50:04.592]  It's too easy.
[02:50:04.592 --> 02:50:07.033]  That's why I'm not understanding.
[02:50:07.033 --> 02:50:08.254]  No, I really respect you.
[02:50:08.254 --> 02:50:16.038]  Listen, I respect you because when we open these phones up for Obama people, the really arrogant ones call in and are very entertaining.
[02:50:16.038 --> 02:50:21.220]  But it's sad to hear real Obama supporters calling and go, I don't have a job and I won't have food.
[02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:24.802]  That's what they've done to America that 50 years ago could feed the whole world.
[02:50:25.737 --> 02:50:28.459]  And now, we can't even feed ourselves.
[02:50:28.459 --> 02:50:29.739]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[02:50:29.739 --> 02:50:31.260]  I'm bankrupting the network doing this.
[02:50:31.260 --> 02:50:31.880]  God bless you, sir.
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:33.461]  I appreciate your call.
[02:50:33.461 --> 02:50:39.405]  I'm going to skip this network break because I've got to premiere this special report here in a moment and finish up with your calls.
[02:50:39.405 --> 02:50:44.848]  And briefly, there'll come a time when the country's so poor, people won't even be able to support us with sponsorship.
[02:50:44.848 --> 02:50:49.150]  You won't even be able, your dollar will be so worthless, you won't be able to even get a water filtration system.
[02:50:49.150 --> 02:50:51.531]  You won't be able to buy the magazine in bulk to give it out to people.
[02:50:51.531 --> 02:50:52.072]  That's their plan.
[02:50:52.532 --> 02:50:58.455]  The Vildenberg Group has bragged, Paul has an article out today, that they want to make us poor to control us.
[02:50:58.455 --> 02:51:01.076]  Making you poor is a tool of total control.
[02:51:01.076 --> 02:51:03.917]  And they've done everything they can to shut this country down.
[02:51:03.917 --> 02:51:07.639]  Believe me, I know.
[02:51:07.639 --> 02:51:08.999]  And it is very, very sad.
[02:51:13.047 --> 02:51:25.229]  I just hope listeners will support the broadcast, A, by spreading the word about the AM and FM stations you're listening to, Global Shortwave, Internet Streams and Infowars.com, the video streams at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:25.229 --> 02:51:27.830]  I hope you'll send it out to your email list, your Facebook, your Twitter.
[02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:29.050]  Get our stories out, folks.
[02:51:29.050 --> 02:51:31.951]  Retweet the articles we send out at RealAlexJones.
[02:51:31.951 --> 02:51:38.552]  You have the power, but you have to get aggressive and vote with your dollars and your energy to promote broadcasts like this.
[02:51:38.732 --> 02:51:45.535]  These oases of truth show that we can get the information out to checkmate the globalists, and we're close.
[02:51:45.535 --> 02:51:49.537]  Let me tell you, we're in the fight.
[02:51:49.537 --> 02:51:51.798]  That's why they're coming down on us, okay?
[02:51:51.798 --> 02:51:58.840]  But I mean, it's kind of like a bully starts beating you up, and you get a good lick in, and they go, whoa, this guy can fight.
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:01.742]  Now the real fight's about to start.
[02:52:01.742 --> 02:52:04.823]  Okay, so I mean, it's on.
[02:52:04.823 --> 02:52:05.303]  All right?
[02:52:05.303 --> 02:52:06.744]  I mean, I'm here to tell you, this is it.
[02:52:08.166 --> 02:52:16.052]  Every expert we talk to says their spotty sense, I just got a complete chill, is off the chart right now.
[02:52:16.052 --> 02:52:19.454]  Ah, she got goosebumps on my face.
[02:52:19.454 --> 02:52:20.695]  Look at that.
[02:52:20.695 --> 02:52:22.957]  I mean, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:22.957 --> 02:52:25.939]  This is gut check time, okay?
[02:52:25.939 --> 02:52:28.901]  This is not theatrics here on the radio.
[02:52:28.901 --> 02:52:30.002]  This is not a game.
[02:52:32.421 --> 02:52:35.603]  And they're going to bankrupt us forever, very soon, and put us under Agenda 21.
[02:52:35.603 --> 02:52:40.926]  They want you on welfare to make you go live in a 200 square foot house.
[02:52:40.926 --> 02:52:42.186]  Room.
[02:52:42.186 --> 02:52:46.329]  They're already making welfare recipients take unlimited shots, like 50 a year.
[02:52:48.798 --> 02:52:50.199]  I'm going to go to this special report.
[02:52:50.199 --> 02:52:52.740]  It's very powerful.
[02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:56.802]  We're going to give it a title in the next hour and put it up at Infowars.com.
[02:52:56.802 --> 02:52:57.262]  Get it.
[02:52:57.262 --> 02:52:58.303]  Facebook it.
[02:52:58.303 --> 02:52:59.563]  Put it out on Twitter.
[02:52:59.563 --> 02:53:00.584]  Put it out on YouTube.
[02:53:00.584 --> 02:53:01.264]  Talk it up.
[02:53:01.264 --> 02:53:02.325]  Get it out there.
[02:53:02.325 --> 02:53:05.866]  Fight the COINTELPRO trying to block our videos, trying to distract people.
[02:53:05.866 --> 02:53:08.088]  You cannot be stopped if you take action.
[02:53:08.088 --> 02:53:10.109]  Little things turn into big things.
[02:53:10.109 --> 02:53:10.689]  Small things
[02:53:12.642 --> 02:53:15.064]  Can grow like a mustard seed.
[02:53:15.064 --> 02:53:16.545]  Big things have small beginnings.
[02:53:16.545 --> 02:53:24.291]  So, this video is our answer to the Demand a Plan, Hollywood, Bloomberg, Turn in the Guns video.
[02:53:24.291 --> 02:53:27.273]  And it gets into false flag, democide, you name it.
[02:53:27.273 --> 02:53:30.996]  Put together by Melissa Melton and the rest of our crew.
[02:53:30.996 --> 02:53:31.936]  Here it is.
[02:53:31.936 --> 02:53:32.817]  Northwoods.
[02:53:32.817 --> 02:53:34.058]  Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:53:34.058 --> 02:53:34.879]  Gladio.
[02:53:34.879 --> 02:53:35.939]  Kent State.
[02:53:35.939 --> 02:53:37.140]  Ruby Ridge.
[02:53:37.140 --> 02:53:38.061]  Waco.
[02:53:38.061 --> 02:53:39.222]  Oklahoma City.
[02:53:39.222 --> 02:53:40.343]  The World Trade Center.
[02:53:40.803 --> 02:53:41.783]  The Pentagon.
[02:53:41.783 --> 02:53:42.924]  Shanksville.
[02:53:42.924 --> 02:53:44.284]  Hurricane Katrina.
[02:53:44.284 --> 02:53:46.085]  Fast and furious.
[02:53:46.085 --> 02:53:47.865]  Fast and furious.
[02:53:47.865 --> 02:53:49.426]  Fast and furious.
[02:53:49.426 --> 02:53:50.386]  How many more?
[02:53:50.386 --> 02:53:51.387]  How many more?
[02:53:51.387 --> 02:53:53.447]  How many more false flags?
[02:53:53.447 --> 02:53:54.368]  How many more?
[02:53:54.368 --> 02:53:56.768]  How many more government buildings?
[02:53:56.768 --> 02:53:58.249]  How many more innocent people?
[02:53:58.749 --> 02:53:59.890]  How many more?
[02:53:59.890 --> 02:54:00.910]  How many more?
[02:54:00.910 --> 02:54:03.852]  What has been the number one cause of unnatural death in history?
[02:54:03.852 --> 02:54:09.756]  Democide or death by government has killed 290 million people on record.
[02:54:09.756 --> 02:54:12.958]  290 million people killed.
[02:54:12.958 --> 02:54:14.499]  Killed.
[02:54:14.499 --> 02:54:16.240]  290 million.
[02:54:16.240 --> 02:54:17.620]  Killed by government.
[02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:18.601]  The government.
[02:54:18.601 --> 02:54:22.223]  The number one killer in history is democide.
[02:54:22.223 --> 02:54:23.104]  Democide.
[02:54:23.104 --> 02:54:24.164]  Democide.
[02:54:24.164 --> 02:54:25.825]  Death by government.
[02:54:25.825 --> 02:54:26.666]  Look it up.
[02:54:26.666 --> 02:54:27.546]  Go look it up.
[02:54:27.546 --> 02:54:28.007]  In the 20th century,
[02:54:29.684 --> 02:54:30.004]  I think?
[02:54:53.295 --> 02:54:56.076]  Pol Pot's Cambodia, funded by the U.S.
[02:54:56.076 --> 02:54:56.836]  government.
[02:54:56.836 --> 02:54:58.697]  Two million people killed.
[02:54:58.697 --> 02:55:04.679]  China's Communist Party, as many as 76 million people killed between 1949 and 1987.
[02:55:04.679 --> 02:55:09.040]  And the list goes on and on.
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:13.742]  So now you know the most dangerous thing to you and your family in the world is government.
[02:55:13.742 --> 02:55:17.823]  Because mass murderers agree, gun control works.
[02:55:18.483 --> 02:55:20.925]  Disarming citizens is democide.
[02:55:20.925 --> 02:55:23.326]  Disarming citizens is democide.
[02:55:23.326 --> 02:55:25.148]  Disarming people is democide.
[02:55:25.148 --> 02:55:28.490]  How many people have died because of Fast and Furious?
[02:55:28.490 --> 02:55:30.731]  No more false flags.
[02:55:30.731 --> 02:55:31.652]  Enough.
[02:55:31.652 --> 02:55:32.612]  Enough.
[02:55:32.612 --> 02:55:33.053]  It's enough.
[02:55:33.766 --> 02:55:34.887]  Now is the time.
[02:55:34.887 --> 02:55:35.827]  It's time.
[02:55:35.827 --> 02:55:40.829]  It's time to realize that when the government takes your guns, people die.
[02:55:40.829 --> 02:55:45.091]  It's time to realize the biggest threat to you and your family is government.
[02:55:45.091 --> 02:55:49.513]  It's time to recognize government is the greatest killer of all time.
[02:55:49.513 --> 02:55:50.494]  It's time.
[02:55:50.494 --> 02:55:51.834]  Demand a plan.
[02:55:51.834 --> 02:55:52.655]  Demand.
[02:55:52.655 --> 02:55:53.895]  Demand a plan.
[02:55:53.895 --> 02:55:56.056]  Demand a plan right now.
[02:55:56.056 --> 02:55:57.577]  As a free human being.
[02:55:57.577 --> 02:55:58.777]  As an American.
[02:55:58.777 --> 02:55:59.998]  As an American.
[02:55:59.998 --> 02:56:01.619]  As an American citizen.
[02:56:01.619 --> 02:56:02.439]  As a patriot.
[02:56:02.699 --> 02:56:03.981]  For your children.
[02:56:03.981 --> 02:56:12.476]  Demand to know why you and your children are forced into gun-free zones while government officials, celebrities, and their children
[02:56:13.090 --> 02:56:15.172]  Are protected by armed guards.
[02:56:15.172 --> 02:56:18.014]  Demand they show you the word hunting in the Second Amendment.
[02:56:18.014 --> 02:56:22.357]  Demand to know why the government shipped thousands of guns to Mexican drug cartels.
[02:56:22.357 --> 02:56:25.920]  Demand our government stops blowing up federal buildings.
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:31.284]  Demand that our troops stop protecting opium fields in Afghanistan and come home.
[02:56:31.284 --> 02:56:33.886]  Demand the government stop this phony drug war.
[02:56:33.886 --> 02:56:40.551]  Demand to know why the Department of Homeland Security bought more than 1.6 billion hollow point bullets with our money.
[02:56:40.891 --> 02:56:45.594]  Demand our government stop poisoning our food supply with genetically modified organisms.
[02:56:45.594 --> 02:56:53.218]  Demand that President Obama stops killing innocent women and children all around the world with his illegal drone attacks.
[02:56:53.218 --> 02:56:56.300]  Demand an end to these unconstitutional wars.
[02:56:56.300 --> 02:56:59.822]  Demand that the TSA stop groping our genitals at the airport.
[02:56:59.822 --> 02:57:04.305]  Demand that the NSA stop illegally spying on all of us all the time.
[02:57:04.305 --> 02:57:07.607]  Demand that toxic fluoride be removed from the water supply.
[02:57:07.807 --> 02:57:14.851]  We demand our politicians uphold the Constitution and Bill of Rights as they swore to when they took office.
[02:57:14.851 --> 02:57:15.631]  It's time.
[02:57:15.631 --> 02:57:19.813]  It's time for our leaders to act like leaders.
[02:57:19.813 --> 02:57:23.175]  It's time for our leaders to read the Constitution.
[02:57:23.175 --> 02:57:26.596]  It's time for our leaders to obey the Constitution.
[02:57:26.596 --> 02:57:27.677]  The Constitution.
[02:57:27.677 --> 02:57:28.998]  The Constitution.
[02:57:28.998 --> 02:57:33.520]  Because a well-regulated militia with ten round magazines wouldn't last very long.
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:35.781]  Demand an end to citizen disarmament.
[02:57:36.201 --> 02:57:38.142]  Government-sponsored terror.
[02:57:38.142 --> 02:57:39.203]  And democide.
[02:57:39.203 --> 02:57:40.624]  Democide.
[02:57:40.624 --> 02:57:41.845]  Death by government.
[02:57:41.845 --> 02:57:43.466]  Right now.
[02:57:43.466 --> 02:57:44.587]  Right now.
[02:57:44.587 --> 02:57:46.108]  Right now.
[02:57:46.108 --> 02:57:52.152]  We are sick and tired of our tyrannical government taking away our rights.
[02:57:52.152 --> 02:57:54.094]  Stop stealing our rights.
[02:57:54.094 --> 02:57:55.134]  Our rights.
[02:57:55.134 --> 02:57:56.175]  Our rights.
[02:57:56.175 --> 02:57:58.957]  How many more people does government have to kill?
[02:57:58.957 --> 02:57:59.998]  Enough.
[02:57:59.998 --> 02:58:00.338]  Enough.
[02:58:00.338 --> 02:58:01.599]  Enough already.
[02:58:02.262 --> 02:58:03.123]  Enough.
[02:58:03.123 --> 02:58:04.184]  Enough.
[02:58:04.184 --> 02:58:05.145]  Enough.
[02:58:05.145 --> 02:58:06.045]  Enough.
[02:58:06.045 --> 02:58:07.387]  Enough.
[02:58:07.387 --> 02:58:17.675]  Enough of the people laying down and letting government kill them in mass after disarming them as they've done throughout history over and over again.
[02:58:17.675 --> 02:58:18.736]  Enough.
[02:58:18.736 --> 02:58:23.761]  Enough to laying down and letting these criminals use us up like slaves.
[02:58:27.717 --> 02:58:33.980]  Alright folks, the full video with all the documentations going up at Infowars.com in the next 10 minutes.
[02:58:33.980 --> 02:58:42.643]  Get it out to everyone you know.
[02:58:42.643 --> 02:58:46.065]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.065 --> 02:58:48.266]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.389 --> 02:58:57.973]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:58:57.973 --> 02:59:01.215]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[02:59:01.215 --> 02:59:04.017]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:59:04.017 --> 02:59:07.040]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:59:07.040 --> 02:59:10.042]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:59:10.542 --> 02:59:15.744]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[02:59:15.744 --> 02:59:18.426]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[02:59:18.426 --> 02:59:22.087]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[02:59:22.087 --> 02:59:25.809]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[02:59:26.309 --> 02:59:29.752]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[02:59:29.752 --> 02:59:34.176]  And you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.
[02:59:34.176 --> 02:59:36.438]  Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:59:36.438 --> 02:59:42.164]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:59:42.164 --> 02:59:45.307]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[02:59:45.307 --> 02:59:49.791]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:59:52.034 --> 02:59:53.554]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.554 --> 02:59:55.615]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.615 --> 03:00:09.338]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:09.338 --> 03:00:14.920]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:00:14.920 --> 03:00:18.080]  In the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:18.080 --> 03:00:20.201]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[03:00:24.423 --> 03:00:27.990]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:27.990 --> 03:00:33.542]  When populations get decadent and decide it's cool to lay down a big government, everything collapses.
[03:00:33.542 --> 03:00:34.864]  You get put in forced labor brigades.
[03:00:36.533 --> 03:00:39.636]  And the people that were on the welfare are usually right in there in the forced labor.
[03:00:39.636 --> 03:00:47.505]  Of course, people that actually work usually make better workers, so it's the former welfare folks with their machine guns prodding us around like the Soviet Union.
[03:00:47.505 --> 03:00:50.168]  Let's go to Jeannie, who says she's a real Obama supporter.
[03:00:50.168 --> 03:00:52.651]  She's a KLBJ 590 listener.
[03:00:52.651 --> 03:00:54.693]  I guess she's listening on 90.1, though, right now.
[03:00:54.693 --> 03:00:57.937]  Jeannie, so tell me about how great Obama is.
[03:00:58.783 --> 03:01:07.532]  Well, I mean, I'm not going to say how great, but Alex, I was a Ron Paul supporter when he came out of the President's election.
[03:01:07.532 --> 03:01:08.874]  Who else was I going to vote for?
[03:01:08.874 --> 03:01:09.815]  Think about it.
[03:01:09.815 --> 03:01:15.681]  To me, Romney, all the Republicans, I feel like he wanted to take women's rights away and all this.
[03:01:16.522 --> 03:01:19.106]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[03:01:19.106 --> 03:01:22.111]  We're not even saying you should have voted for Romney.
[03:01:22.111 --> 03:01:30.103]  It's the endorsement of Obama and people feeling like they had a victory because he's in there now and he's your president.
[03:01:30.103 --> 03:01:31.385]  It was all rigged.
[03:01:32.026 --> 03:01:37.168]  Okay, that's what I'm telling you, is that it's rigged, and it is wrong what they did to Ron Paul.
[03:01:37.168 --> 03:01:41.670]  It's probably why Romney overtly lost, but there's election fraud as well.
[03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:47.813]  My point is, is that America is going in a socialist direction, and socialism, ma'am, is a nightmare.
[03:01:48.613 --> 03:01:55.081]  I mean, France now has over 80% taxes with a 75% tax on everything above that.
[03:01:55.081 --> 03:02:00.026]  You make over a million dollars, you pay 80% plus 75 on any money you keep.
[03:02:00.026 --> 03:02:01.949]  I mean, should taxes be at 99% or 100%?
[03:02:05.166 --> 03:02:17.514]  Alex, I want to say something controversial, and I don't care if it gets everyone mad, but I'm going to say, to me, the reason this country is going to you-know-where is because of old white men who are running the Senate and Congress, who have been running it.
[03:02:17.514 --> 03:02:22.877]  We have, what, 1% of Mexicans and black people that are in the Congress Senate?
[03:02:22.877 --> 03:02:24.478]  No, it's not.
[03:02:24.478 --> 03:02:25.719]  Are you kidding?
[03:02:25.719 --> 03:02:27.080]  It's an all-time record high.
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:28.821]  There's like 20 women in the Senate alone.
[03:02:30.606 --> 03:02:32.988]  White old men running this country!
[03:02:32.988 --> 03:02:33.909]  The Senate is perfect!
[03:02:33.909 --> 03:02:35.530]  Ma'am, hold on a minute.
[03:02:35.530 --> 03:02:37.872]  Are you really this ding-ding-batted?
[03:02:37.872 --> 03:02:41.235]  Where it's just fun to... Hold on, I know Democrats are all about race.
[03:02:41.235 --> 03:02:42.136]  You sound like a white lady.
[03:02:42.136 --> 03:02:43.157]  I don't know if you are.
[03:02:43.157 --> 03:02:45.779]  But the point is, it's like just fun to put on white people.
[03:02:45.779 --> 03:02:46.860]  And I get that's fun.
[03:02:46.860 --> 03:02:48.882]  I mean, that's the new trendy thing.
[03:02:48.882 --> 03:02:50.423]  I get it.
[03:02:50.423 --> 03:02:52.545]  You know, jumping off cliffs is fun too.
[03:02:52.545 --> 03:02:53.425]  The point is...
[03:02:54.528 --> 03:03:01.981]  Is that certainly, you know ma'am, that Dianne Feinstein, you know, is a quote, white lady, and she's saying turn our guns in.
[03:03:01.981 --> 03:03:06.148]  So if she's white, if being white's bad, I guess she's a woman though, that must make it okay.
[03:03:06.148 --> 03:03:08.171]  Do you support us turning our guns in?
[03:03:08.962 --> 03:03:09.982]  No, I don't.
[03:03:09.982 --> 03:03:10.602]  I don't.
[03:03:10.602 --> 03:03:11.903]  I mean, I really don't.
[03:03:11.903 --> 03:03:12.743]  I'm against that.
[03:03:12.743 --> 03:03:24.146]  But to me, that's my opinion as a 49-year-old Mexican woman living in Texas, I feel the reason this country is going to crap is because of old white men running it.
[03:03:24.146 --> 03:03:25.086]  Let me be clear.
[03:03:25.086 --> 03:03:30.428]  Okay, so why is Nigeria, that's old black people running that, why is that going to hell?
[03:03:30.428 --> 03:03:34.829]  Or let me ask you a question, why is Mexico, I guess Mexico is doing really good because
[03:03:37.472 --> 03:03:41.975]  But I mean, Mexico, I mean, is that the fault of all white men?
[03:03:41.975 --> 03:03:43.836]  How many people are there that are white?
[03:03:43.836 --> 03:03:45.577]  Older men running the Congress and Senate.
[03:03:45.577 --> 03:03:48.678]  And you tell me why we are in this situation.
[03:03:48.678 --> 03:03:52.520]  Well, Japan is in a total depression for about 15 years.
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:54.301]  I mean, is that the fault of all white men?
[03:03:54.301 --> 03:03:55.642]  Under who?
[03:03:55.642 --> 03:03:56.943]  Let's see, President Bush.
[03:03:56.943 --> 03:04:03.867]  Well, ma'am, ma'am, I mean, listen, I'm asking you something here, because you know white skin is only a lack of pigment.
[03:04:05.623 --> 03:04:07.124]  Alex, look, I'm being honest.
[03:04:07.124 --> 03:04:08.765]  But hold on, I understand.
[03:04:08.765 --> 03:04:09.605]  I got it.
[03:04:09.605 --> 03:04:11.546]  Is it racist to own guns?
[03:04:11.546 --> 03:04:13.368]  Start putting him down also.
[03:04:13.368 --> 03:04:19.731]  If it was a Mexican president and we were in this situation, I'd have no problem saying, you know, he's a problem.
[03:04:19.731 --> 03:04:21.392]  Hold on, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[03:04:21.392 --> 03:04:21.912]  Did you hear me?
[03:04:21.912 --> 03:04:24.554]  The president is a puppet.
[03:04:24.554 --> 03:04:29.557]  We're talking about how you're supporting a puppet.
[03:04:29.557 --> 03:04:30.998]  Alex, we can agree to disagree.
[03:04:30.998 --> 03:04:34.700]  No, no, but say you like Obama, but you don't like turning your guns in.
[03:04:36.429 --> 03:04:37.650]  No, I'm not going to do it.
[03:04:37.650 --> 03:04:39.111]  I'm going to ask you a question.
[03:04:39.111 --> 03:04:42.334]  Should we get rid of our Congress and put in the Mexican Congress?
[03:04:42.334 --> 03:04:43.535]  Would that make things better?
[03:04:43.535 --> 03:04:44.095]  No.
[03:04:44.095 --> 03:04:45.877]  I think we should start all over.
[03:04:45.877 --> 03:04:50.260]  But wait a minute, you just said, maybe we should go down to Mexico.
[03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:52.322]  That's kind of what the North American Union is.
[03:04:52.322 --> 03:04:56.005]  And bring all those great people, because they're Hispanic, up here to run.
[03:04:56.005 --> 03:04:57.826]  They would do a better job.
[03:04:57.826 --> 03:04:59.287]  I think she's actually right, folks.
[03:04:59.287 --> 03:05:00.368]  We've got to continue here.
[03:05:00.368 --> 03:05:01.529]  Let's continue.
[03:05:01.529 --> 03:05:02.630]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.910 --> 03:05:13.579]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.579 --> 03:05:18.043]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:18.043 --> 03:05:20.785]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:20.785 --> 03:05:31.574]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.054 --> 03:05:35.536]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.536 --> 03:05:41.679]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.679 --> 03:05:51.584]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.584 --> 03:05:53.085]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.085 --> 03:05:54.986]  It's an info war.
[03:05:54.986 --> 03:05:56.927]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:05.172]  Who wants to be disease-free, full of energy, and vibrant health?
[03:06:05.172 --> 03:06:11.876]  Two reasons you may feel constantly tired and run down could be that your body's acid level is high and your pH level is low.
[03:06:11.876 --> 03:06:13.678]  How does acid enter your body?
[03:06:13.678 --> 03:06:17.580]  A cup of coffee, a sandwich, tap water, stress, and cell phones.
[03:06:17.580 --> 03:06:20.082]  Plus, your own body produces acid on a regular basis.
[03:06:20.442 --> 03:06:25.124]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops alkalize the water you drink and raise your pH level.
[03:06:25.124 --> 03:06:30.347]  They promote more oxygen in your system, higher energy potential, and many other documented health benefits.
[03:06:30.347 --> 03:06:35.890]  And studies show viruses, bacteria, and toxins cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:06:35.890 --> 03:06:41.293]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops is the least expensive and the best pH level product you can buy.
[03:06:41.293 --> 03:06:44.034]  Order AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops for just $29.95 at AlkaVision.com.

[03:06:50.621 --> 03:06:52.864]  Supercharge your health with pH drops from AlkaVision dot com.
[03:07:02.304 --> 03:07:07.787]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[03:07:07.787 --> 03:07:10.969]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression.
[03:07:10.969 --> 03:07:13.751]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[03:07:13.751 --> 03:07:16.693]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[03:07:16.693 --> 03:07:19.655]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[03:07:20.155 --> 03:07:25.278]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[03:07:25.278 --> 03:07:27.879]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[03:07:27.879 --> 03:07:31.481]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[03:07:31.481 --> 03:07:35.183]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[03:07:51.208 --> 03:07:54.309]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?

[03:08:00.305 --> 03:08:01.427]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:08:01.427 --> 03:08:03.191]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:26.385 --> 03:08:32.491]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you just joined us, you missed an incredible phone call.
[03:08:32.491 --> 03:08:35.834]  A woman called in and she said, I am a real Obama supporter.
[03:08:35.834 --> 03:08:37.315]  She was real.
[03:08:37.315 --> 03:08:43.961]  And she said, there are too many white people in Congress and that's why America's in trouble and that's why I support Obama.
[03:08:43.961 --> 03:08:44.922]  She said she was Hispanic.
[03:08:46.464 --> 03:08:52.927]  I mean, and I said, so Mexico, should we take the Mexican Congress, one of the most corrupt governments in the world, and bring it up here?
[03:08:52.927 --> 03:08:59.271]  Governments are corrupt, whether you're in Africa, or whether you're in Iran, or whether you're in Israel, or whether you're in Russia.
[03:08:59.271 --> 03:09:06.054]  You read the Bible, it talks about government being wicked, and wickedness in high places, and the god of this world.
[03:09:06.054 --> 03:09:13.838]  Now, whether you believe in a physical devil or not, the issue is, historically, most governments are bad, and they tend to get worse and worse and worse the longer they're in.
[03:09:15.857 --> 03:09:17.798]  And I gotta be honest with you.
[03:09:17.798 --> 03:09:20.300]  I mean, the ignorance of Obama supporters.
[03:09:20.300 --> 03:09:22.321]  We got David Montana says he's an Obama supporter.
[03:09:22.321 --> 03:09:30.165]  I'm gonna continue to take Obama supporter calls right now on this third day of January 2013.
[03:09:30.165 --> 03:09:33.447]  800-259-9231.
[03:09:33.447 --> 03:09:35.228]  Program note.
[03:09:35.228 --> 03:09:40.892]  There is a video we just premiered that is one of the most powerful short pieces we've done in a long time.
[03:09:42.133 --> 03:09:46.634]  Collaboration between the whole crew, but John Bowne and Melissa Melton kind of came up with it.
[03:09:46.634 --> 03:09:55.337]  Or I think simultaneously Bowne said we should do a knockoff of the demand a plan Bloomberg thing with all the stars saying turn your guns in.
[03:09:55.337 --> 03:09:56.797]  And then others had the idea.
[03:09:56.797 --> 03:10:02.299]  But the point is, I also had the idea to like show Hollywood violence and them shooting people.
[03:10:02.299 --> 03:10:04.239]  And then one of our listeners had that idea.
[03:10:04.239 --> 03:10:05.660]  I never talked about it on air.
[03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:09.101]  People just have the same thoughts when you're looking at hypocrisy.
[03:10:09.981 --> 03:10:15.888]  So we've put out a new video pointing out that government's been the biggest killer in history and it shows all the statistics at the end.
[03:10:15.888 --> 03:10:24.618]  We're going to put an article up in the next 10 minutes or so, they're putting it together right now, that shows from the University of Hawaii's study, because I keep saying 260 plus million,
[03:10:26.909 --> 03:10:28.170]  They corrected me.
[03:10:28.170 --> 03:10:30.292]  It was 290 plus million.
[03:10:30.292 --> 03:10:33.595]  Sometimes I get factoids off, usually to the lower number.
[03:10:33.595 --> 03:10:35.757]  My mind tends to underestimate.
[03:10:35.757 --> 03:10:38.820]  That's why people think I'm exaggerating sometimes.
[03:10:38.820 --> 03:10:39.881]  Most of the time.
[03:10:39.881 --> 03:10:42.023]  I mean, I would literally say over 95% of the time.
[03:10:46.030 --> 03:10:49.692]  I underestimate, or sometimes I flip numbers.
[03:10:49.692 --> 03:10:51.353]  It's almost like dyslexia.
[03:10:51.353 --> 03:11:02.219]  But side issue, I just want you to know, if you hear me say something wrong sometimes, it's, you know, earlier I said 1540 a station was calling in and it was, you know, 540.
[03:11:02.219 --> 03:11:05.540]  I mean, you know, it's the fact is I'm not following a teleprompter.
[03:11:05.540 --> 03:11:06.881]  I'm not following a script here.
[03:11:06.881 --> 03:11:08.262]  I'm really telling you what I think.
[03:11:08.262 --> 03:11:09.583]  So you're going to see some of that.
[03:11:09.583 --> 03:11:12.644]  But the point is, government non-military casualties, 200.
[03:11:15.540 --> 03:11:22.936]  290 plus million people killed last century and so we say demand a plan to stop government mass murder.
[03:11:24.898 --> 03:11:28.722]  And the video will go up at InfoWars.com for everybody to see it.
[03:11:28.722 --> 03:11:32.225]  And I want you to send it out on email, Twitter, Facebook, everywhere.
[03:11:32.225 --> 03:11:34.267]  Get it out to local talk stations.
[03:11:34.267 --> 03:11:36.269]  Get it out to everybody.
[03:11:36.269 --> 03:11:41.113]  And again, it's now live on YouTube.
[03:11:41.113 --> 03:11:43.655]  Demand a real plan is what we call it.
[03:11:43.655 --> 03:11:45.757]  Demand a real plan.
[03:11:45.757 --> 03:11:47.259]  Demand a real plan.
[03:11:48.380 --> 03:11:51.463]  And we're going to have the statistics that we have in it posted under it.
[03:11:51.463 --> 03:11:57.788]  She's also writing another article that'll be done soon that basically goes with it.
[03:11:57.788 --> 03:12:01.351]  But for Obama supporters, call in on your Obama phones, 800-259-9231.
[03:12:01.351 --> 03:12:01.411]  800-259-9231.
[03:12:01.411 --> 03:12:03.032]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Montana.
[03:12:03.032 --> 03:12:04.033]  Dave, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:12:15.959 --> 03:12:25.044]  Alex, I support Obama because I hate the Republicans so much because they hate the 10th Amendment.
[03:12:25.044 --> 03:12:26.605]  They could have been in office.
[03:12:26.605 --> 03:12:29.086]  They could have ran away with the election.
[03:12:29.086 --> 03:12:44.774]  All they had to do was back up the 17 states that exercised the 10th Amendment and allowed their people to use medical cannabis and to use cannabis to hemp
[03:12:45.583 --> 03:12:55.191]  Rudy Al is part of the cannabis for industry, and jobs, and liberty.
[03:12:55.191 --> 03:12:55.751]  No, no, I hear you.
[03:12:55.751 --> 03:12:56.612]  I'm going to go back to you, Dave.
[03:12:56.612 --> 03:12:57.833]  I'm going to go back to you.
[03:12:57.833 --> 03:13:06.099]  This is the best Obama supporter call we've gotten in the five or six shows, or sections of broadcasts that we've done, because he actually has an issue.
[03:13:06.099 --> 03:13:09.002]  That thing about, oh, the Republicans want to take women's rights.
[03:13:10.622 --> 03:13:12.983]  I mean, that's just a pure political distraction.
[03:13:12.983 --> 03:13:17.606]  The state's rights issue, and I've supported decriminalization, I've supported legalization.
[03:13:17.606 --> 03:13:19.187]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:13:19.187 --> 03:13:27.792]  And I know all you do is get low-quality marijuana full of pesticides and let the corrupt mafia and government get a percentage of it by making it illegal.
[03:13:27.792 --> 03:13:29.233]  Just like in prohibition.
[03:13:29.233 --> 03:13:30.714]  I'm not a big supporter of alcohol.
[03:13:30.714 --> 03:13:32.976]  I think it's more destructive than marijuana.
[03:13:32.976 --> 03:13:37.899]  And I'm for drug decriminalization, but also I think the state shouldn't be involved in alcohol.
[03:13:38.732 --> 03:13:40.473]  It should be a local thing, a criminal thing.
[03:13:40.473 --> 03:13:44.396]  You poison somebody with alcohol you sold, you're going to prison.
[03:13:44.396 --> 03:13:46.818]  Now you poison somebody with alcohol, you just get a fine.
[03:13:46.818 --> 03:13:55.163]  You see, but side issue, the thing I'm trying to get at here is, Obama tripled the raids in California on medical cannabis.
[03:13:55.163 --> 03:13:57.405]  Tripled the raids, look it up.
[03:13:57.405 --> 03:13:58.486]  I've had all the activists on.
[03:14:00.433 --> 03:14:05.917]  So that's the bottom line on that front is that they did noises like they support.
[03:14:05.917 --> 03:14:09.159]  He said he was against the NDAA but he actually wrote it.
[03:14:09.159 --> 03:14:11.160]  And then said he wouldn't sign it but did.
[03:14:11.160 --> 03:14:14.482]  See Obama, I'll tell you what Obama does.
[03:14:14.482 --> 03:14:19.926]  He gives you 15 pain pills to put you under.
[03:14:19.926 --> 03:14:24.309]  You pass out before he slits your throat.
[03:14:24.309 --> 03:14:29.573]  The Republicans, they want to just stab you in the back a couple times.
[03:14:30.822 --> 03:14:32.724]  But they don't give you any painkillers.
[03:14:32.724 --> 03:14:34.786]  I mean, if you want to use that analogy.
[03:14:34.786 --> 03:14:36.208]  And that's the thing about it.
[03:14:36.208 --> 03:14:40.012]  It's not... I want to hear from Obama supporters why you think he's good.
[03:14:40.012 --> 03:14:45.258]  I mean, if you say, oh, I don't like him either, but, you know, at least he did this, but see, you're even really wrong about that.
[03:14:45.258 --> 03:14:47.520]  But I at least understand you had a thought.
[03:14:47.520 --> 03:14:51.064]  You had a reason in your mind you thought something was going on.
[03:14:51.064 --> 03:14:51.644]  Let me explain something.
[03:14:52.423 --> 03:14:54.864]  The globalists are gutting the economy, they're in control of that.
[03:14:54.864 --> 03:14:58.466]  They're 85 billion to themselves every month, on top of the trillions they already stole.
[03:14:58.466 --> 03:15:00.807]  And they're going to pass on the inflation to us.
[03:15:00.807 --> 03:15:03.328]  I mean, it's both parties doing it.
[03:15:03.328 --> 03:15:06.829]  That's why I said, Boehner's going to sell us out on tax increases.
[03:15:06.829 --> 03:15:09.891]  77% of households got a tax increase.
[03:15:09.891 --> 03:15:10.471]  More than 10 of them.
[03:15:13.570 --> 03:15:16.531]  Okay, so, you don't have to tell me how bad the Republicans are.
[03:15:16.531 --> 03:15:22.111]  The point is, the Republicans represent the best people in this country.
[03:15:22.111 --> 03:15:38.034]  They are the people that soak up the energy of the Libertarians, Conservatives, Constitutionalists, who, compared to the average Democrat, are more productive, are more pro-human, pro-life, real people.
[03:15:38.034 --> 03:15:39.214]  Okay?
[03:15:39.214 --> 03:15:42.515]  I mean, the average Democrat I know is a helpless,
[03:15:45.439 --> 03:15:52.606]  Disconnected from reality, incredibly weak, stupid person who thinks they're real smart.
[03:15:52.606 --> 03:16:04.296]  The average Republican is a reactive but hard-working person who's been conned as well, but at least believes in private property and the Second Amendment and national sovereignty.
[03:16:04.296 --> 03:16:08.320]  Sure, they've become territorially supportive,
[03:16:09.864 --> 03:16:18.792]  Other Republicans, even though they don't really like him, it's kind of like a husband who doesn't really like their wife, but better not say something to my wife, buddy, or I'll punch your lights out.
[03:16:18.792 --> 03:16:32.145]  And the Democrats know they've taken over, and they know the Republicans are bought off, so they know that conservatives are going to leave Republicans, and the whole party's just going to die, and then it's going to be a giant Democratic Party dictatorship to split in two.
[03:16:32.145 --> 03:16:33.526]  And that's actually been their plan.
[03:16:33.526 --> 03:16:34.487]  They're talking about that.
[03:16:35.868 --> 03:16:37.570]  Cancer divides.
[03:16:37.570 --> 03:16:40.133]  And they're just gonna hammer us up one side and down the other.
[03:16:40.133 --> 03:16:50.184]  When they legalize the 30 million illegals and let them bring in their families to have anchor babies paid for and everything, it's gonna further bankrupt stuff, drive down wages, they're exempt from all the laws.
[03:16:50.184 --> 03:16:52.246]  Again, not that they're bad people.
[03:16:52.246 --> 03:16:55.069]  They're leaving a country brought down by globalism as well.
[03:16:55.069 --> 03:16:57.351]  It's that they're given this free ride
[03:16:58.092 --> 03:17:00.033]  Well, it's the same thing with any other group.
[03:17:00.033 --> 03:17:11.861]  You've got some Hispanic Mexicans who work harder than anybody I've ever seen, who are incredibly smart, know how to fix everything, politically know what's going on, and are good people.
[03:17:11.861 --> 03:17:13.702]  And they will not, because they're Christians.
[03:17:13.702 --> 03:17:14.643]  They're always Christians.
[03:17:14.643 --> 03:17:15.964]  They won't go take welfare.
[03:17:15.964 --> 03:17:17.465]  They're too prideful.
[03:17:17.465 --> 03:17:19.626]  They understand it's bad.
[03:17:19.626 --> 03:17:23.689]  And then you've got the other group, just like with whites or blacks, that wants the free ride.
[03:17:24.620 --> 03:17:28.302]  And it's just disgusting, and everybody's going to have their future destroyed.
[03:17:28.302 --> 03:17:32.503]  All I'm telling you is, the people running things are super bad news.
[03:17:32.503 --> 03:17:34.244]  Let's go to Gordon in Canada.
[03:17:34.244 --> 03:17:36.005]  He is an Obama supporter.
[03:17:36.005 --> 03:17:36.745]  Gordon, go ahead.
[03:17:36.745 --> 03:17:38.466]  I was going to go back to the other guy, but he hung up.
[03:17:38.466 --> 03:17:40.127]  Go ahead, Gordon.
[03:17:40.127 --> 03:17:45.069]  Yeah, you mentioned that you believe the president is basically a puppet.
[03:17:45.069 --> 03:17:46.809]  Is that correct?
[03:17:46.809 --> 03:17:50.351]  Oh my gosh, he's an absolute New World Order puppet, but he enjoys his work.
[03:17:52.161 --> 03:17:57.944]  Okay, so we both agree on one thing, at least today, that the President is basically a puppet.
[03:17:57.944 --> 03:18:04.347]  And really, he, as a puppet, he's basically, would you agree, that he's basically ineffectual as a President?
[03:18:04.347 --> 03:18:06.508]  He's merely a puppet.
[03:18:06.508 --> 03:18:18.213]  Yeah, just like John Boehner, John Boehner, but the spectacle of him being the leader, that's used to pacify people and to create a false debate.
[03:18:18.213 --> 03:18:19.734]  I think that, as a leader,
[03:18:21.053 --> 03:18:28.739]  Obama has been one of the most influential leaders that the United States has ever seen.
[03:18:28.739 --> 03:18:30.600]  Yeah, no, no, Kissinger said that.
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:34.423]  He said Obama's going to bring in the New World Order.
[03:18:34.423 --> 03:18:43.669]  Well, unfortunately, I probably would disagree with you there and say that it was probably Franklin Delano Roosevelt that brought in the New World Order a long time ago.
[03:18:43.669 --> 03:18:47.052]  Yeah, but a beachhead, a beachhead is not true domination.
[03:18:47.970 --> 03:18:54.633]  See, this country had so much wealth and so much power and was so wild, it's taken them 80 years to get to this point.
[03:18:54.633 --> 03:19:03.498]  So, see, that's an argument about... They may have declared a federal emergency and set up state police who are really federal police.
[03:19:03.498 --> 03:19:05.459]  I'm going to skip this break and then go to the bottom of the hour.
[03:19:05.459 --> 03:19:08.420]  Go ahead and make your point.
[03:19:08.420 --> 03:19:09.341]  I'm going to let you talk.
[03:19:10.253 --> 03:19:15.756]  Mr. Jones, I just flew into Canada, a very small country of 32 million people.
[03:19:15.756 --> 03:19:20.718]  I was relatively unaccosted at both security sides of the border.
[03:19:20.718 --> 03:19:34.785]  I enjoy a job that is based on free market society, and the only reason that I'm able to enjoy the standard of living that I do enjoy in the United States is because we have a stable government.
[03:19:35.525 --> 03:19:41.447]  And right now, the United States government is one of the most stable governments in the Western Hemisphere.
[03:19:41.447 --> 03:19:47.769]  And as long as the President of the United States is in power right now, I will continue to enjoy that standard of living.
[03:19:47.769 --> 03:19:52.871]  When I was living under the previous administration's standard of living, it was atrocious.
[03:19:52.871 --> 03:19:55.452]  The police state was far more worse than it is today.
[03:19:55.452 --> 03:19:58.053]  I understand where you're coming from.
[03:19:58.053 --> 03:20:02.154]  I do believe that we've probably stepped over the line in terms of personal liberty.
[03:20:02.794 --> 03:20:15.049]  But to go so far as to start labeling the president or to question the president as integrity, as a man, you and I really don't have the luxury of knowing the person or the human being.
[03:20:15.049 --> 03:20:16.691]  You know, I disagree with that.
[03:20:16.691 --> 03:20:22.177]  You will know them by their fruits and the obsession over
[03:20:23.354 --> 03:20:31.758]  Most Obama supporters I talk to who are intelligent will say the things you're saying and then they'll say, plus you don't know the man, you don't know what he's going through.
[03:20:31.758 --> 03:20:42.242]  Listen, I've really watched Obama carefully and I've read his earlier writings and he is just another narcissist wanting to dominate people.
[03:20:42.242 --> 03:20:44.283]  He's reading off teleprompters.
[03:20:44.283 --> 03:20:47.985]  I'm saying what Obama signifies and the time we're entering.
[03:20:47.985 --> 03:20:50.326]  By the way, I know a lot of folks have been in Canada lately.
[03:20:50.326 --> 03:20:52.387]  They say it was the worst security they ever went through.
[03:20:53.395 --> 03:20:54.996]  Uh, now they must have you profiled.
[03:20:54.996 --> 03:20:57.758]  That's part of the police state and they're leaving you alone because you're business.
[03:20:57.758 --> 03:20:59.740]  You go back and forth.
[03:20:59.740 --> 03:21:04.263]  Uh, Canada, you know, just worst experience I ever had at the hands of the quote police.
[03:21:04.263 --> 03:21:11.609]  Uh, well, not the worst, but the worst as an adult, uh, as a non teenager was there in Canada.
[03:21:11.609 --> 03:21:14.491]  Uh, so, uh, I mean, just to say, I'm doing great.
[03:21:14.491 --> 03:21:15.551]  I'm doing good.
[03:21:15.551 --> 03:21:16.992]  All the financial metrics.
[03:21:18.129 --> 03:21:24.416]  Show the Republican and Democratic leadership are hand-in-glove with this banking takeover.
[03:21:24.416 --> 03:21:29.641]  And for certain people, the economy's doing better.
[03:21:29.641 --> 03:21:35.727]  But overall, worldwide, globalism is designed to render us bankrupt.
[03:21:35.727 --> 03:21:39.711]  And, I mean, the globalist state, they're using this to bankrupt us.
[03:21:42.233 --> 03:21:50.276]  And, you know, Obama's trying to get carbon taxes through worldwide that are designed to block development in the third world, clean development.
[03:21:50.845 --> 03:21:53.866]  Because they don't want them ever becoming self-sufficient.
[03:21:53.866 --> 03:22:03.188]  They want them poor, where they can hand-pick, cherry-pick who they want to come into the armored compounds at the factories with the suicide nets, and then have forced abortions inside.
[03:22:03.188 --> 03:22:05.328]  I mean, I just know too much about the globalists.
[03:22:05.328 --> 03:22:17.731]  I mean, people tend to judge things by... I mean, I guess I could sit here and say... I know a lot of conservative talk show hosts, libertarian talk shows, thinking, well, Alex, things are real bad, but at least, you know, we're going to get bigger audiences during this.
[03:22:18.510 --> 03:22:29.079]  And that's like saying, you know, like if I own stock in a company that sold chemotherapy stuff and one of my kids had cancer and I'm like, well, at least I'm making money off the chemotherapy I just bought because I have stock in it.
[03:22:29.079 --> 03:22:33.463]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's super hyper predatory.
[03:22:33.463 --> 03:22:39.428]  And I've read all these books and papers by the top technocrats saying they're going to set up a world government.
[03:22:39.428 --> 03:22:44.252]  They're going to make it all look sexy and make it look like the bad stuff they're fighting, the good stuff they created.
[03:22:44.252 --> 03:22:46.074]  They're going to shut the economies down.
[03:22:47.409 --> 03:22:48.032]  And they're going to...
[03:22:49.912 --> 03:22:51.693]  Forcibly reduced population.
[03:22:51.693 --> 03:22:57.076]  And then I talk to so-called lefties and they go, well, there are old people do spend too much money at end of life.
[03:22:57.076 --> 03:22:58.317]  We are collectivist.
[03:22:58.317 --> 03:22:59.318]  Let's get rid of them.
[03:22:59.318 --> 03:23:04.461]  I mean, that money that gets spent goes into the system to begin with and funds people.
[03:23:04.461 --> 03:23:05.762]  Is the medical system corrupt?
[03:23:05.762 --> 03:23:07.763]  Yeah, because they're teamed up with government.
[03:23:07.763 --> 03:23:08.863]  I mean, are there reforms?
[03:23:08.863 --> 03:23:09.264]  Yes.
[03:23:09.264 --> 03:23:10.364]  Not the ones we're doing.
[03:23:10.364 --> 03:23:12.446]  It's going to double the cost of health care.
[03:23:12.446 --> 03:23:16.928]  They talk about, see, it's going to give you less care and charge you more for it.
[03:23:16.928 --> 03:23:19.390]  Just like you're going to live in a 250 square foot house.
[03:23:20.856 --> 03:23:24.697]  And pay 90% or 80% of your money in property tax.
[03:23:24.697 --> 03:23:31.638]  Whereas you put that same amount of energy you expended into work, could have lived in a 3,000 square foot house.
[03:23:31.638 --> 03:23:34.299]  I mean, it's just diabolical.
[03:23:34.299 --> 03:23:38.020]  And I mean, look, they put cancer viruses and vaccines.
[03:23:38.020 --> 03:23:40.881]  I can show you all the documents I have before many times.
[03:23:40.881 --> 03:23:42.361]  These are bad people.
[03:23:42.361 --> 03:23:46.802]  They're doing medical experiments on kids in New York right now on record.
[03:23:47.791 --> 03:23:51.918]  And people are like, but Obama, you know, I got an Obama phone.
[03:23:51.918 --> 03:23:55.503]  Or people think the government made the economy good when they're in.
[03:23:55.503 --> 03:23:57.927]  And plus the economy is not good by most metrics.
[03:23:57.927 --> 03:24:00.250]  We're, just because you're doing good?
[03:24:01.161 --> 03:24:06.463]  I mean, here I am a talk show host reaching millions of people, have a big operation, you would call me successful.
[03:24:06.463 --> 03:24:08.945]  I feel successful for waking people up.
[03:24:08.945 --> 03:24:13.687]  I don't feel successful because I've got a new Ford pickup truck.
[03:24:13.687 --> 03:24:18.609]  I don't feel successful because people pull chairs out for me because I'm, quote, a celebrity.
[03:24:18.609 --> 03:24:20.910]  I mean, how do you gauge success?
[03:24:20.910 --> 03:24:21.250]  Go ahead.
[03:24:21.250 --> 03:24:26.953]  Success by the caliber of the person and the integrity of that person, not by his wallet.
[03:24:27.991 --> 03:24:34.400]  Mr. Jones, I have no doubt that your view of a world government is as such as it is.
[03:24:34.400 --> 03:24:36.503]  I've been listening to you for a number of years now.
[03:24:37.285 --> 03:24:39.787]  And I respect your opinions and views.
[03:24:39.787 --> 03:24:49.054]  However, I do disagree with you with regard to your sense of how quickly we're about to go over any precipice.
[03:24:49.054 --> 03:24:56.240]  When I travel around the world, one of the best countries that I'm always pleased to come back to is the United States of America.
[03:24:56.240 --> 03:24:58.642]  Yes, we have a very... But that's not the government!
[03:24:58.642 --> 03:24:59.703]  That's not the government!
[03:24:59.703 --> 03:25:02.105]  Everybody acts like the government made America.
[03:25:03.010 --> 03:25:04.616]  Guns made America, buddy.
[03:25:04.616 --> 03:25:06.121]  Whiskey made America.
[03:25:06.121 --> 03:25:07.084]  Free booting.
[03:25:07.084 --> 03:25:08.991]  Kicking people's teeth in made this country.
[03:25:10.615 --> 03:25:12.195]  Obama did not make this.
[03:25:12.195 --> 03:25:13.816]  We made this country.
[03:25:13.816 --> 03:25:26.419]  But when we begin to target one individual and blame him for our collective woes, and incessantly, I mean, and constantly, I think we're really, truly missing the target.
[03:25:26.419 --> 03:25:27.819]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:25:27.819 --> 03:25:32.720]  Do you think it's good to use taxpayer money to ship General Motors, Cadillac, and Volt factories to China?
[03:25:34.620 --> 03:25:50.452]  I understand that there are decisions that are being made in boardrooms all over the United States of America that are being made by individuals who are actually being controlled by individuals such as Vickney Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, and the likes of Obama.
[03:25:50.452 --> 03:25:52.873]  Exactly, and Obama is their golden child.
[03:25:52.873 --> 03:25:55.655]  I appreciate your call.
[03:25:55.655 --> 03:25:59.058]  Tomorrow, we'll try to take more calls.
[03:25:59.058 --> 03:26:01.119]  You can talk in circles with each other all day.
[03:26:05.239 --> 03:26:07.439]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[03:26:07.439 --> 03:26:13.441]  I'm not saying Mitt Romney would have been better.
[03:26:13.441 --> 03:26:20.122]  What does Cynthia McKinney, who's been so demonized by the corporate media, say because she exposed government slave rings and things?
[03:26:20.122 --> 03:26:22.123]  Sex slave rings, white slave rings.
[03:26:22.123 --> 03:26:27.484]  And the public's so dumb, they always send me emails saying, I see them printed out, what about black slaves?
[03:26:27.484 --> 03:26:30.064]  Sex slavery's called white slavery, folks.
[03:26:30.064 --> 03:26:31.665]  The point is, is that
[03:26:34.065 --> 03:26:37.968]  She says Obama is the more effective evil.
[03:26:37.968 --> 03:26:42.652]  He's not the lesser, he's not the greater, he's the more effective.
[03:26:42.652 --> 03:26:44.693]  It's real simple, okay folks?
[03:26:44.693 --> 03:26:48.256]  If the globalists want your guns, you want guns.
[03:26:48.256 --> 03:26:50.818]  If the globalists say don't buy gold, you want gold.
[03:26:50.818 --> 03:26:55.902]  If the globalists say don't eat organic food, you want organic food.
[03:26:55.902 --> 03:26:58.423]  If the globalists say it's good to radiate your food,
[03:26:59.460 --> 03:27:00.662]  It's bad to radiate your food.
[03:27:00.662 --> 03:27:02.985]  And then you can go look at the reasons it's bad.
[03:27:02.985 --> 03:27:06.730]  But in every case, if they say something's good, you better believe it's bad.
[03:27:06.730 --> 03:27:12.197]  I mean, they call this modern world empowering women.
[03:27:12.197 --> 03:27:13.279]  Women aren't in power.
[03:27:13.279 --> 03:27:14.481]  They look like they've been run over.
[03:27:16.547 --> 03:27:26.809]  They've been gaslighted into thinking they're ugly, and they don't have any value, when their family and everything is waiting for them, and worshiping them, and they're running everything.
[03:27:26.809 --> 03:27:28.869]  Women have always been the center of everything.
[03:27:28.869 --> 03:27:36.110]  Women are running everything, and they think they don't have anything, because the television is there showing them this imaginary Hollywood world.
[03:27:36.110 --> 03:27:38.891]  Let me tell you, that isn't what Hollywood's like.
[03:27:38.891 --> 03:27:41.331]  You can't keep me far... I get... I'm not bragging.
[03:27:41.331 --> 03:27:45.672]  I get invited, not in as much as I used to, but I get invited to
[03:27:47.350 --> 03:27:52.454]  Behind the scenes, huge world events, world concerts.
[03:27:52.454 --> 03:28:01.540]  You know, skyboxes at Formula One with the top five world rock band.
[03:28:01.540 --> 03:28:02.221]  Constantly.
[03:28:02.221 --> 03:28:03.862]  And it's not that I'm against those people.
[03:28:03.862 --> 03:28:04.683]  They're listeners.
[03:28:04.683 --> 03:28:09.766]  Maybe I should go meet with them and stand around all fancy with bodyguards and preen.
[03:28:09.766 --> 03:28:13.249]  I mean, I guess that is success, but that is not what I'm into.
[03:28:13.249 --> 03:28:14.009]  And not because
[03:28:15.057 --> 03:28:16.518]  I don't like status.
[03:28:16.518 --> 03:28:18.980]  I want status amongst thinkers.
[03:28:18.980 --> 03:28:21.783]  I want status amongst strong men and women.
[03:28:21.783 --> 03:28:24.025]  I want status amongst artists.
[03:28:24.025 --> 03:28:38.397]  Not to be a peacock, but I want to influence them because I have a vein of primal human liberty that I want to infect people with.
[03:28:38.397 --> 03:28:38.877]  You understand?
[03:28:38.877 --> 03:28:40.919]  I don't just want to have 15 children.
[03:28:43.174 --> 03:28:46.417]  Because I'm vain and likes firing children.
[03:28:46.417 --> 03:28:47.538]  I want life.
[03:28:47.538 --> 03:28:49.399]  I want to live forever.
[03:28:49.399 --> 03:28:53.542]  I want to hug them and train them and see the electricity in their eyes.
[03:28:53.542 --> 03:29:03.210]  And I want their great-great-grandchildren to be on Alpha Centauri, living to be a thousand years old, doing things that the eye has not seen or ear has not heard.
[03:29:03.210 --> 03:29:04.331]  I want to live.
[03:29:04.331 --> 03:29:05.832]  I want to produce.
[03:29:05.832 --> 03:29:07.754]  I want to let it all hang out.
[03:29:09.957 --> 03:29:24.120]  I don't want to run around in some primitive monkey behavior and sit up in the top of the highest part of the tree like a chimpanzee with... I mean, you'll see arrogant chimpanzees or baboons acting just like humans, sitting up there, because the top one will sit there, just lounge like a king.
[03:29:24.120 --> 03:29:26.201]  Oh, I'm in charge.
[03:29:26.201 --> 03:29:29.241]  Oh, I'm in... That doesn't do anything for me.
[03:29:29.241 --> 03:29:35.303]  Spacecraft, mathematics, art, beauty, that, the next level is what I want.
[03:29:35.303 --> 03:29:36.423]  I want to see you win.
[03:29:37.705 --> 03:29:39.466]  The globalists want to see you fall.
[03:29:39.466 --> 03:29:41.607]  I mean, it's real simple.
[03:29:41.607 --> 03:29:43.468]  The government is not your friend.
[03:29:43.468 --> 03:29:44.948]  It's cancer.
[03:29:44.948 --> 03:29:46.189]  Get the video at InfoWars.com.
[03:29:46.189 --> 03:29:47.309]  Get it out to everybody.
[03:29:47.309 --> 03:29:50.811]  The Gun Grabber video is now up there right now.
[03:29:50.811 --> 03:29:54.433]  On the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.433 --> 03:29:57.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
