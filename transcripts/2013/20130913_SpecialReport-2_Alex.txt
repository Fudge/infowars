[00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.554]  Can you tell me what happened?
[00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.118]  I picked up Mr. Gary Hayes coming down to the Capitol.
[00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.360]  It's a nice day.
[00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:22.145]  He open carries his black powder pistol.
[00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:23.567]  What is that, Chris?
[00:00:23.647 --> 00:00:26.631]  It's a pre-1899 replica.
[00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:41.092]  And he was rolling around the Capitol talking to the security guards and the troopers about an incident that happened earlier today.
[00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:43.715]  And Trooper...what was his name?
[00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:44.476]  Cruz?
[00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:45.277]  Yes.
[00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:53.466]  Trooper Cruz decided that he was going to become alarmed at Mr. Hayes' open-carried pistol because he could see it.
[00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:54.687]  It was being displayed.
[00:00:56.356 --> 00:01:05.220]  So he asked Mr. Hayes if he could please take it back to his vehicle so that Officer Cruz would not remain alarmed, and Gary said, no thank you.
[00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:11.983]  So at that point, Officer Hayes told him that if he's not going to comply, he's going to be under arrest for disorderly conduct.
[00:01:13.424 --> 00:01:16.925]  And so, how long did it take for them to officially arrest him?
[00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:24.729]  He had a conversation with First Security Guard Johnson.
[00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:33.045]  And then a State Highway Patrol Bike Officer, Pena.
[00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.788]  Those each were about 15-20 minute encounters each.
[00:01:37.488 --> 00:01:41.671]  And then I had a conversation with Cruz for a good 20 minutes before he was placed under arrest.
[00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:42.792]  So it was a good block?
[00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:43.232]  Yeah.
[00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:46.295]  Alright, so they placed him under arrest.
[00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:49.417]  I noticed we have some EMSA trucks, some emergency trucks out here.
[00:01:49.827 --> 00:01:52.587]  Was there any type of confrontation or why are those out?
[00:01:52.688 --> 00:01:54.628]  No, Mr. Hayes is a disabled vet.
[00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:55.768]  He is paralyzed.
[00:01:56.368 --> 00:01:58.188]  He requires that wheelchair to move.
[00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.449]  Not just, he can't walk well.
[00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.249]  He cannot walk at all and he takes several medications.
[00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:10.351]  So they called the EMS to come out and check him over and make sure that he got handled in a proper manner while they kidnapped him.
[00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:16.032]  So, do you guys have any plans of bailing him out or what's going to happen now?
[00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:17.752]  We are under orders to not bail him out.
[00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:21.639]  So this should be an interesting next few days.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.685]  He is a member of the National Association for Legal Gun Defense or something like that.
[00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:32.306]  I'm sure they'll be contacted.
[00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:37.989]  And there are apparently 62 people viewing our particular live stream.
[00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.910]  Awesome!
[00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.690]  Great!
[00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.991]  Tell everybody hi!
[00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:42.572]  Hi everybody!
[00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:49.456]  I gotta give thanks to Mike Cargill who called me and tipped me off to this thing going on at Texas Gun Works.
[00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:54.802]  So thanks Mike, and I was actually out here when they arrested one of the guys earlier.
[00:02:54.822 --> 00:02:57.763]  I believe there was somebody that got arrested even before I got here earlier this morning.
[00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:01.464]  A gentleman, he was a pastor.
[00:03:01.484 --> 00:03:01.984]  Terry Hulk?
[00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:02.884]  Yes, Terry Hulk.
[00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:08.326]  And they arrested him, I was here to witness that and the troopers behavior at that particular incident.
[00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:12.327]  Well thank you very much for being here.
[00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:12.667]  Thank you.
[00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:13.787]  Alright, thanks.
