[00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:05.954]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.954 --> 00:00:07.716]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.497]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:11.079]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.620]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.804]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:20.907]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:47.648]  You remember Michael Hastings, whose vehicle blew up a few weeks ago in Los Angeles in the middle of the night after he said he was going into hiding and had death threats?
[00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:48.528]  I'm going into hiding!
[00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:49.969]  Biggest story of my life!
[00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:50.890]  I'm getting death threats!
[00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.931]  Boom!
[00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:57.334]  Engine blows down the street, car rolls over off the side of the road.
[00:00:57.334 --> 00:01:02.177]  Well, now mainstream news out in L.A.
[00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:04.939]  San Diego News 6 and others are reporting
[00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:14.127]  That they've talked to the police and firefighters and others, and they've been told, don't talk about it and don't release the police reports.
[00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:18.289]  Because any moron can tell a car bomb.
[00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:35.354]  And, ladies and gentlemen, I've talked to people, Navy SEALs and others, where there have been cases of, say, a Navy SEAL slit somebody's throat in a bar argument, and then they're being brought up on murder charges.
[00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:47.637]  And the military marches in, military police, give the judge a national security letter, and then the Navy SEAL is taken out of the state and never charged.
[00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:52.319]  Okay, so believe me folks, that's what they've told the cops.
[00:01:52.319 --> 00:02:02.043]  Obviously it's a car bomb, and this is a new America where they just blow up your car, obviously the Army, blow up your car, and then just tell everybody.
[00:02:02.043 --> 00:02:05.545]  Next they'll say, don't even say the car blew up and there's fire coming out of it.
[00:02:06.863 --> 00:02:30.524]  So I saw this article up at Infowars.com this morning, coming from Paul Joseph Watson, and I have reached out to Staff Sergeant Biggs, his good friend, and we're reaching out to his wife as well to see if they're ready to go public fully.
[00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:36.721]  But she's already said, via Biggs at the funeral, that she's going to quote, bring down whoever did this.
[00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:42.462]  Well, you're going to bring down whoever did this by officially coming out.
[00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.963]  And there's starting to be more coverage of this.
[00:02:45.963 --> 00:02:51.405]  Suspicions grow over death of journalist probing NSA, CIA abuses.
[00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:59.828]  Alex Newman, over at the New American Magazine, is reporting on the fact that mainstream media is now starting to cover all this.
[00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:05.994]  Again, there's the headline on the News 6 San Diego.
[00:03:05.994 --> 00:03:10.938]  Michael Hastings' crash investigation heats up.
[00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:14.261]  How about there's a clear cover-up going on?
[00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:19.626]  I mean, folks, when they torched Dorner's cabin, even if Dorner was a bad guy, we don't know.
[00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:20.607]  Who knows if he even did it?
[00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:26.434]  When they said, we're gonna burn it down, bring in the fire, okay, it's placed, we burned it down, all right, we burned him up.
[00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:32.377]  On audio, in front of everybody, six different feeds, different conversations, and then said, we never said burn him up.
[00:03:32.377 --> 00:03:33.417]  Well, yeah, you did.
[00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:36.079]  Okay, well, we didn't mean burn him up.
[00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.081]  I mean, they can now line you and your family up, machine gun you on the street.
[00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:47.584]  I've seen this where they've executed CIA section chiefs and people like Carney down in Houston a few years ago.
[00:03:47.584 --> 00:03:50.286]  Cops get him out of the car, stand him up, shoot him right in the head.
[00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.752]  Guys just stand there with his hands at his side.
[00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:55.652]  Execution!
[00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:56.573]  Boom!
[00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:59.394]  They got hit teams in every major police department.
[00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:04.717]  This is a foreign banking cartel that's taken over and now thinks so little of you.
[00:04:04.717 --> 00:04:06.418]  They publicly fund Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:06.418 --> 00:04:08.098]  They publicly ship in the drugs.
[00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:10.179]  They publicly run the Mexican mafia.
[00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:12.400]  They publicly run all the major rackets.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.002]  They publicly put cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:18.623]  They publicly put fluoride in the water to brain damage you and give you cancer.
[00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:19.524]  They publicly
[00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:22.872]  Do whatever they want out in the open.
[00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:26.482]  85 billion taxpayer money stolen a month, given to offshore banks.
[00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:28.607]  Congress is told they can't see where it's at.
[00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:31.432]  On and on and on.
[00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:35.454]  Yeah, there's footage out of Syria where the Al-Qaeda youth brigades are being trained.
[00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:36.334]  That's in the news today.
[00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:43.457]  We're going to be breaking all of that down and more straight ahead here on the transmission.
[00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:48.918]  And Nomi Prins, the former managing director at Goldman Sachs, is going to be in studio with us.
[00:04:48.918 --> 00:04:54.560]  We've flown in here to be interviewed for the Obama Deception 2 that is in production.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.761]  And we're going to have open phones as well.
[00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:57.482]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.482 --> 00:04:58.462]  Big news straight ahead.
[00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:03.649]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:09.154]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:05:09.154 --> 00:05:16.901]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:26.009]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:33.377]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:05:33.377 --> 00:05:36.261]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:43.209]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:44.710]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.910]  Another plane just hit!

[00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:23.303]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:37.298 --> 00:08:46.188]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday the 9th day of July 2013 worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:46.188 --> 00:08:48.792]  We're going to have the former managing partner
[00:08:50.407 --> 00:08:53.650]  They're at Goldman Sachs.
[00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.812]  Managing Director at Goldman Sachs.
[00:08:55.812 --> 00:09:00.717]  A big insider who blew the whistle more than a decade ago on what was happening at Goldman Sachs.
[00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:02.139]  She's going to be in studio with us.
[00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:04.501]  She's an independent journalist and best-selling author.
[00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:08.005]  Nomi Prins coming up in the third hour today.
[00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:11.849]  But I want to just out of the gates here when the broadcast starts before I get into some news.
[00:09:12.369 --> 00:09:22.396]  To fire the number out for first-time callers to call in with any question that you have for yours truly because I get so many emails, so many comments, so many...
[00:09:23.866 --> 00:09:33.829]  A request to answer questions, it's pretty much impossible to get to them all, but it's good, I think, to just open the phones up and take the wildcard calls of questions.
[00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:38.990]  So, you've got questions, I'll try to give you answers, or at least my take on things.
[00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.511]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, on this Tuesday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:09:52.834 --> 00:09:55.955]  I am completely overwhelmed with news right now.
[00:09:55.955 --> 00:10:02.237]  Police and firefighters have been ordered not to speak about Michael Hastings' explosion.
[00:10:02.237 --> 00:10:06.878]  LAPD refuses to release police report to journalists.
[00:10:06.878 --> 00:10:09.138]  The wife and his friends think they murdered him.
[00:10:09.138 --> 00:10:10.639]  He said, I'm getting death threats.
[00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:11.879]  I'm going into hiding.
[00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.020]  Biggest story of my life.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.400]  His car blows up.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.181]  And the so-called prostitute media will not even cover that.
[00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:21.862]  Two weeks after that broke on this broadcast.
[00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:28.720]  But now local news is saying, hey, we went to get the police report that's normally released.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.262]  They're saying they've been told not to release it.
[00:10:31.262 --> 00:10:34.384]  Gee, told by who?
[00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:41.510]  I can't tell you how many confirmed cases there are of police catch a plane on the tarmac, usually at a small town airport.
[00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.432]  There's been a lot of famous cases of this.
[00:10:43.432 --> 00:10:46.234]  And it's a CIA aircraft with drugs on it.
[00:10:46.234 --> 00:10:48.696]  Or a CIA aircraft flying kids out of the country.
[00:10:50.162 --> 00:10:51.363]  For people to be tortured.
[00:10:51.363 --> 00:10:54.044]  I mean, you name it, it's evil, they're doing it.
[00:10:54.044 --> 00:11:07.671]  And... There'll be a big standoff, and then national security gets declared, and then letters are issued to the police chief and the judges, and they follow the orders and let them just go.
[00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:15.055]  And that's exactly what's going on here, as if the federal government and the shadow government that's hijacked it is God.
[00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:16.936]  And ladies and gentlemen, it is not God.
[00:11:18.567 --> 00:11:23.136]  Government and the corrupt bureaucracy that's taken over is not God.
[00:11:23.136 --> 00:11:24.779]  There's one of those bombshell stories.
[00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:29.247]  Then there's this video and audio we're going to play later that a listener sent us.
[00:11:29.247 --> 00:11:30.970]  It's breaking on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:32.387 --> 00:11:36.048]  And we asked the question, you know, here in the article, is this the TSA?
[00:11:36.048 --> 00:11:37.368]  And the answer is yes.
[00:11:37.368 --> 00:11:51.751]  Two years ago, Paul Watson noticed on the TSA's own website, training videos showing them at shopping malls in Florida and at football stadiums in Florida, searching people.
[00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:54.171]  Well now, this is San Antonio.
[00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:57.372]  And folks, they never tell you where they're going to be.
[00:11:57.372 --> 00:12:01.133]  They had this Operation Independence last July 4th and over the weekend.
[00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:06.845]  Where they had TSA checkpoints in Austin, in San Antonio, in Dallas, in Houston.
[00:12:06.845 --> 00:12:09.907]  It all came out.
[00:12:09.907 --> 00:12:12.329]  But it's up to citizens to videotape this.
[00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:19.453]  And it's canine units with TSA on their shirts, searching people at the mall.
[00:12:19.453 --> 00:12:23.776]  TSA invades roads, highways with Viper checkpoints.
[00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:29.022]  Now again, that's what we reported on last week.
[00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:31.883]  Now it's in San Antonio.
[00:12:31.883 --> 00:12:36.766]  New article that came out last night on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:41.188]  TSA sniffing bags in Texas shopping mall.
[00:12:41.188 --> 00:12:45.170]  We're going to be getting to that.
[00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:50.032]  Also, we're going to be getting into the latest on the Amnesty bill.
[00:12:52.042 --> 00:13:11.334]  Congressman says Obama jamming amnesty in the house, killing any type of real reform, and basically ignoring their oath of office, a complete absolute criminal opening of the borders, total legalization of anybody that wants to come here, absolute welfare to people that have been here illegally, the list goes on and on.
[00:13:11.334 --> 00:13:19.399]  We're going to be getting into that report as well.
[00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.180]  And then we've got
[00:13:22.409 --> 00:13:26.773]  A good article, it's very informative from Washington's blog up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:34.921]  The fact that mass surveillance doesn't keep us safe goes mainstream, and then he lists a bunch of articles.
[00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:41.127]  Mainstream articles where they admit, well wait a minute, we've had all this NSA surveillance forever, and it didn't stop all these terror events.
[00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:51.176]  In fact, even if the terror is real, you've got a better chance of being killed by a honeybee or falling in your shower or a bolt of lightning than terrorism.
[00:13:51.176 --> 00:13:52.476]  Why is this going on?
[00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:55.097]  Plus, it doesn't protect us from the terrorism.
[00:13:55.097 --> 00:13:55.897]  No.
[00:13:55.897 --> 00:13:59.518]  It is the pretext and the excuse to take over our lives.
[00:13:59.518 --> 00:14:01.638]  Duh!
[00:14:01.638 --> 00:14:03.959]  And I was thinking about all the new videos coming out.
[00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:11.754]  Of the TSA doing proctology exams, pulling diapers off babies, sticking their hands down women's pants.
[00:14:11.754 --> 00:14:17.377]  They're back doing it for a few, maybe six, eight months or so.
[00:14:17.377 --> 00:14:20.278]  The reports went down, they backed off.
[00:14:20.278 --> 00:14:21.799]  They would put kids through a different line.
[00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:24.201]  Now they're back doing it, so everybody knows.
[00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:31.124]  As soon as our resistance comes to a crescendo, they back off so that we back off and they come right back.
[00:14:31.124 --> 00:14:33.686]  And that's a warfare technique used.
[00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.092]  And we are under attack, ladies and gentlemen, by the globalists.
[00:14:38.092 --> 00:14:39.934]  We're all being conditioned.
[00:14:39.934 --> 00:14:50.582]  They're trying to sabotage our industry, sabotage our jobs, pay to ship our jobs overseas, like they've done with General Motors.
[00:14:50.582 --> 00:15:00.129]  And now I see the video, new video, in Texas and other states, where the police pull you over and say, I'm going to search the car.
[00:15:02.452 --> 00:15:04.033]  And they search the car.
[00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:07.656]  And then they say, I'm going to do a cavity search.
[00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:10.858]  We played this video and audio yesterday.
[00:15:10.858 --> 00:15:13.100]  And the women say, you're joking.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.121]  They're like, no.
[00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:20.326]  And then they go into your pants and grab you.
[00:15:20.326 --> 00:15:24.068]  And by the way, two women, one glove.
[00:15:24.068 --> 00:15:25.449]  And I hate to get gross about this.
[00:15:25.449 --> 00:15:28.892]  You know, my wife said, your show never used to be like this.
[00:15:28.892 --> 00:15:29.433]  Why are you?
[00:15:29.433 --> 00:15:30.653]  And I go, what am I supposed to do?
[00:15:31.573 --> 00:15:38.737]  Yes, my show for 17 years on air, till the last year or so, I didn't talk about the police sticking their fingers in people.
[00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:39.818]  They're doing it!
[00:15:39.818 --> 00:15:42.119]  They're the ones doing it!
[00:15:42.119 --> 00:15:45.681]  I mean, I have to illustrate it so that the nightmare stops.
[00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:56.388]  I mean, I gotta tell you now, I took my wife out to a movie last night, went and picked my children up, and my parents at about 9 o'clock, and I saw, let me not exaggerate, 15 police cars.
[00:15:57.466 --> 00:15:59.890]  All, you know, state, local, you name it.
[00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.835]  Pulling people over everywhere like a lurking barracuda.
[00:16:03.835 --> 00:16:06.699]  And when they pull you over now, they say, what's in the car?
[00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:07.600]  I want to search.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.823]  And you got to say, no, that violates before the amendment.
[00:16:09.823 --> 00:16:10.865]  What are you hiding?
[00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:12.607]  Well, here, let me come search your car, Bubba.
[00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:19.025]  This idea that we're all criminals and then any cop knows the government ships in the drugs.
[00:16:19.025 --> 00:16:23.149]  Any cop knows, I talk to them, that the big banks launder the money.
[00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.850]  That's all over the news.
[00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.571]  And they go, that ain't my department.
[00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:30.254]  I'm just doing my job, seeing if you got drugs.
[00:16:30.254 --> 00:16:31.876]  And I'm just like, just leave me alone.
[00:16:34.218 --> 00:16:41.626]  And I'm going to start, when I have time, I'm going to start pulling over and telling the cops, the government deals the drugs, I want to search your car.
[00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:42.827]  I am.
[00:16:42.827 --> 00:16:43.148]  I am.
[00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:49.454]  I'm going to drive around, as soon as, because I've got so much going on, folks, I'm working on average about 14 hours a day right now.
[00:16:49.454 --> 00:16:51.276]  Some days 18 hours a day.
[00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:53.859]  But I need to go out with my crew and just pull up and say, hi!
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.681]  Mind if I search your car?
[00:16:56.681 --> 00:16:57.882]  And they'll look at me like I'm crazy.
[00:16:57.882 --> 00:17:01.165]  And I'll go, statistically, police steal drugs more than any other group in the country.
[00:17:01.165 --> 00:17:06.348]  Would you like to see some criminology news articles?
[00:17:06.348 --> 00:17:13.794]  And I'll have some of the prestigiously researched university studies on it.
[00:17:13.794 --> 00:17:16.016]  And the cop is going to act like I'm completely crazy.
[00:17:16.016 --> 00:17:24.242]  And I'll go, wait a minute, you pull people over for no reason and randomly ask to search and then intimidate people through color of law because they're ignorant to search their vehicles?
[00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:28.712]  Mind if I search?
[00:17:28.712 --> 00:17:35.896]  And I guarantee it's going to be, you get in your car and you get out of here, you're interfering with a police officer's duties.
[00:17:35.896 --> 00:17:53.566]  I saw a checkpoint on a neighborhood street when I was visiting family a couple years ago, and I pulled over, I got out about 100 yards away, parked the neighborhood, walked up nicely and said, hi, just to see what they do.
[00:17:53.566 --> 00:17:54.767]  It was about 10 DPS.
[00:17:55.996 --> 00:17:59.539]  And the one in charge goes, you get in your car and you get out of here!
[00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:01.680]  Because I am scum!
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.443]  I am a blood bag to pay his salary!
[00:18:04.443 --> 00:18:05.443]  I am food!
[00:18:05.443 --> 00:18:06.584]  I'm a dog!
[00:18:06.584 --> 00:18:07.745]  I am trash!
[00:18:07.745 --> 00:18:08.866]  I am filth!
[00:18:08.866 --> 00:18:10.327]  I am the scum of the earth!
[00:18:10.327 --> 00:18:12.289]  I am a nobody!
[00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.849]  And I said, what?
[00:18:12.849 --> 00:18:14.911]  I was just going to walk up and I'm not allowed to talk to you?
[00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:18.894]  And he began screaming, you get out of here!
[00:18:18.894 --> 00:18:21.015]  Just like crazy!
[00:18:21.015 --> 00:18:23.377]  And I said, okay, I thought that's how you act.
[00:18:23.377 --> 00:18:24.458]  I just was doing a test.
[00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.512]  I mean, completely insane.
[00:18:28.512 --> 00:18:34.036]  Completely wild-eyed, and I guarantee if I'd have been rude, he wouldn't have acted like that.
[00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:37.999]  I did it as a test.
[00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:39.320]  And of course, my phone was dead.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.221]  I hadn't charged it.
[00:18:40.221 --> 00:18:41.802]  That was the other problem, was I didn't get it on video.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.101]  But it just shows the warped psychology.
[00:18:46.101 --> 00:18:48.422]  And we know the police are out of control in China.
[00:18:48.422 --> 00:18:50.123]  We know they're out of control in Russia.
[00:18:50.123 --> 00:18:56.525]  We know they're out of control in Mexico, and Venezuela, and Nicaragua, and El Salvador, and Brazil.
[00:18:56.525 --> 00:19:00.106]  We know they're out of control in Eastern Europe, but not America.
[00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:02.387]  No, no, our police are perfect.
[00:19:02.387 --> 00:19:10.650]  By the way, people all over the world that even live in third world dictatorships watch how the police act in America, and they cannot believe it.
[00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:13.385]  They cannot believe it.
[00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:16.090]  They are like, why do Americans put up with this?
[00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.313]  Pull over to the side right there.
[00:19:18.313 --> 00:19:19.495]  Am I being detained or am I free to go?
[00:19:19.495 --> 00:19:20.918]  Pull over to the side right there.
[00:19:20.918 --> 00:19:22.019]  It's a warrantless checkpoint.
[00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:22.600]  Step on out.
[00:19:23.558 --> 00:19:24.679]  Yep, that's a warrantless check.
[00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:26.219]  And then the cops laugh at him.
[00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:29.681]  They go, he thinks he's got a constitution!
[00:19:29.681 --> 00:19:31.982]  We ought to fast forward to that after the break.
[00:19:31.982 --> 00:19:35.684]  Look at that scumball American!
[00:19:35.684 --> 00:19:37.405]  Yeah!
[00:19:37.405 --> 00:19:39.666]  Oh, it's the country's all ours!
[00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:41.727]  We'll spout whatever we want!
[00:19:41.727 --> 00:19:43.648]  Government runs Al-Qaeda!
[00:19:43.648 --> 00:19:45.389]  Government ships in and drugs!
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.661]  Bill Carroll here for Blue Tax.

[00:24:19.772 --> 00:24:26.575]  But getting back to this West Virginia video that we've had posted on InfoWars.com for the last week or so.
[00:24:26.575 --> 00:24:28.656]  We played it on the Nightly News, we never played it here on the radio.
[00:24:30.703 --> 00:24:33.604]  He comes up to a warrantless checkpoint.
[00:24:33.604 --> 00:24:34.864]  They want to search his car.
[00:24:34.864 --> 00:24:36.084]  He says no.
[00:24:36.084 --> 00:24:38.845]  They say, pull over there!
[00:24:38.845 --> 00:24:40.625]  I'm Yosemite Sam!
[00:24:40.625 --> 00:24:44.366]  And then they dig through and laugh about the Constitution.
[00:24:44.366 --> 00:24:45.666]  And that he knows he's right.
[00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:49.446]  He ain't done nothing wrong.
[00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:56.408]  And then, you see the one cop, if you're a radio listener, you can't see it, but the video's up on the site.
[00:24:56.408 --> 00:24:57.428]  He sees the camera.
[00:24:58.424 --> 00:25:10.488]  And by the way, we're studying and looking at a bunch of models right now of dashcams we recommend for people to get to put in their car to do just what they did here.
[00:25:10.488 --> 00:25:13.009]  Now listen to him.
[00:25:13.009 --> 00:25:21.872]  He's searching the car illegally, no warrant, no probable cause, at a giant checkpoint.
[00:25:21.872 --> 00:25:22.792]  Right out of Nazi Germany.
[00:25:29.386 --> 00:25:32.888]  He's gigging through your car.
[00:25:32.888 --> 00:25:35.870]  But he's perfectly innocent and he knows his rights.
[00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.193]  He knows what the Constitution says.
[00:25:39.193 --> 00:25:41.594]  We got air fresheners under the seat.
[00:25:41.594 --> 00:25:45.397]  Wasn't a very good alert.
[00:25:45.397 --> 00:25:45.677]  Uh-oh!
[00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.859]  They see the camera and shut up now.
[00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:51.561]  He's like, hey, look over there, there's a camera.
[00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:52.902]  Oops!
[00:25:52.902 --> 00:25:54.023]  Now he's shining his light in it.
[00:25:55.649 --> 00:25:59.110]  And I love how cops pull you over and aggressively shove a light in your face.
[00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.112]  I mean, what we put up with our kids being groped at the airport.
[00:26:02.112 --> 00:26:06.914]  Miss USA, they go in her body and she's crying and everybody just laughs.
[00:26:06.914 --> 00:26:09.595]  Because that's what, this is not what a free country does.
[00:26:09.595 --> 00:26:13.016]  America never acted like this and was the opposite of this.
[00:26:13.016 --> 00:26:15.817]  Nazi Germany didn't do stuff like this.
[00:26:15.817 --> 00:26:19.619]  They came and politely took you away.
[00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:21.239]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:26:21.239 --> 00:26:22.220]  And this is really nothing.
[00:26:23.629 --> 00:26:39.042]  I've seen footage and put it in my film Road to Tyranny, where the police find a pocket constitution at a unconstitutional checkpoint and they begin hyperventilating in fear and arrest her for it, believing it's illegal.
[00:26:39.042 --> 00:26:40.824]  This is not a Monty Python satire.
[00:26:42.979 --> 00:26:43.720]  Is this legal?
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.661]  I don't know, get a supervisor!
[00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:48.744]  They had George Washington, by the way, on the front of it.
[00:26:48.744 --> 00:26:55.849]  They get so scared by George Washington, and I guess they should be, that they begin hyperventilating.
[00:26:55.849 --> 00:26:59.932]  And, I mean, I gotta be honest with you, they're setting up more and more of these unconstitutional checkpoints.
[00:26:59.932 --> 00:27:04.716]  You pull up to them, and usually they said, mind if I search?
[00:27:04.716 --> 00:27:08.419]  And then you go, oh no, sure, because nothing illegal in your car.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:29.488]  When you do that, they will put you on the side of the highway with fire ants crawling up your leg for an hour, and will tear your car apart, and will make you take your luggage out, make you take your spare tire out, and then go, alright, you can go looking for drugs that on record
[00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:36.631]  Two banks laundered $378 billion of drug money from 2007 to 2009.
[00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:39.412]  Wachovia, Wells Fargo.
[00:27:39.412 --> 00:27:41.513]  You know Warren Buffett?
[00:27:41.513 --> 00:27:43.833]  No one got in trouble.
[00:27:43.833 --> 00:27:47.795]  They were leasing the aircraft to fly the drugs, the money and the guns.
[00:27:47.795 --> 00:27:48.795]  They run it all.
[00:27:48.795 --> 00:27:50.595]  It's a $500 billion industry.
[00:27:50.595 --> 00:27:51.716]  One of the biggest in the U.S.
[00:27:52.927 --> 00:27:55.089]  One of the biggest in the world, just in the U.S.
[00:27:55.089 --> 00:27:59.532]  It's a giant business, and then they're like, you know what we'll do?
[00:27:59.532 --> 00:28:14.123]  We'll make it illegal, this is 100 years ago, or about 80 years ago, and then when these idiots use it, we'll put them in our prisons!
[00:28:14.123 --> 00:28:19.828]  And it goes on, and on, and on, and on, and all the major banks do it.
[00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:22.542]  They run America!
[00:28:22.542 --> 00:28:23.984]  And then you get these cops.
[00:28:23.984 --> 00:28:25.326]  Imagine this.
[00:28:25.326 --> 00:28:31.477]  If you pull over to a group of cops sitting around talking, and walk over and go, hello officers!
[00:28:31.477 --> 00:28:32.378]  I think I'm gonna do this.
[00:28:33.527 --> 00:28:37.688]  Here in Austin, I'm going to walk up with a camera and go, mind if I search your vehicle?
[00:28:37.688 --> 00:28:46.691]  And I bet they're going to arrest me and probably, like I'm going to do it to state police because they're about the most aggressive in Texas now, and they're probably going to club my head and charge me with assault.
[00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:49.732]  I'm going to have a camera, I'm giving them fair warning, hidden across the street.
[00:28:49.732 --> 00:28:51.013]  I'm going to burn them!
[00:28:51.013 --> 00:28:52.473]  I'm going to burn them good!
[00:28:52.473 --> 00:28:54.674]  And that's the kind of stuff we need to start doing.
[00:28:54.674 --> 00:28:58.015]  Okay, it's time to get aggressive with this criminality.
[00:28:58.015 --> 00:29:00.536]  By the way, they had the head of the police union here in Austin.
[00:29:02.844 --> 00:29:10.386]  Come out and tell Antonio Beeler that he better stop filming police or something bad's going to happen.
[00:29:10.386 --> 00:29:11.887]  Something violent!
[00:29:11.887 --> 00:29:13.487]  What, like Michael Hastings maybe?
[00:29:13.487 --> 00:29:15.908]  Because you're in charge now, aren't you?
[00:29:15.908 --> 00:29:18.869]  You can do whatever you want, can't you?
[00:29:18.869 --> 00:29:24.331]  And again, I'm trying to note here the difference between constitutional police and what is taking over.
[00:29:26.118 --> 00:29:30.841]  Because imagine, I guarantee you, imagine if I search your car, the cops are going to flip out.
[00:29:30.841 --> 00:29:40.727]  Well, how do you think we feel when you pull us over for some made up thing and go, I'm going to search the vehicle, and then next, I'm going to run my hand up your rear end.
[00:29:40.727 --> 00:29:42.288]  How's that sound?
[00:29:42.288 --> 00:29:44.109]  You like land of the free?
[00:29:44.109 --> 00:29:45.430]  You brave?
[00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.192]  You going to stand up against me American scum?
[00:29:48.192 --> 00:29:49.333]  No, you ain't!
[00:29:49.333 --> 00:29:50.734]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.734 --> 00:29:52.235]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.257 --> 00:30:00.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.268 --> 00:31:03.750]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.812]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[00:31:06.812 --> 00:31:09.634]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:13.076]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:31:13.076 --> 00:31:19.320]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.663]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[00:32:04.915 --> 00:32:11.903]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[00:32:11.903 --> 00:32:22.735]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce NanoSilver solutions, our 2-ounce NanoSilver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[00:32:23.843 --> 00:32:28.107]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[00:32:28.107 --> 00:32:35.434]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:32:35.434 --> 00:32:46.344]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.
[00:32:47.364 --> 00:32:47.965]  I think so.
[00:33:12.512 --> 00:33:28.765]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[00:33:28.765 --> 00:33:30.867]  I'm going to your phone calls and back in the news.
[00:33:30.867 --> 00:33:35.610]  By the way, there's another video in West Virginia that came out last week at a warrantless checkpoint.
[00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.513]  The particular one I was just talking about was Tennessee.
[00:33:39.802 --> 00:33:47.754]  Uh, where the, uh, deputies at the big checkpoint, you know, the guy doesn't want his car searched.
[00:33:47.754 --> 00:33:51.759]  And so they just say, get your butt right over there, boy.
[00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:52.641]  And again, this is what?
[00:33:53.755 --> 00:33:59.240]  Corrupt countries always do, but see, now you're supposed to salute the police and actually bend over.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.722]  That was in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
[00:34:01.722 --> 00:34:13.352]  And the Liberty Crier is linking through to a mainstream news article and reporting that on top of it, the particular deputy reportedly lied about having insurance when he rear-ended someone in his pickup truck.
[00:34:13.352 --> 00:34:14.694]  The file shows.
[00:34:16.237 --> 00:34:26.281]  Video of the DUI checkpoint in Rutherford County, already viewed by millions of times online, was recorded by a member of the Libertarian Party and raises questions about drivers' rights at checkpoints.
[00:34:26.281 --> 00:34:27.821]  There's no questions.
[00:34:27.821 --> 00:34:34.044]  The Supreme Court, the state courts have all ruled that it's unconstitutional to have a warrantless checkpoint.
[00:34:34.044 --> 00:34:42.247]  You can have a checkpoint if there is a, you know, red pickup truck with a bank robber that matches a description believed to be going down Highway 10.
[00:34:43.487 --> 00:34:47.449]  And then they set it up looking for the red pickup.
[00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.310]  But now they use any excuse.
[00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.431]  Fireworks got shot off.
[00:34:51.431 --> 00:34:53.112]  We think it might be a firearm.
[00:34:53.112 --> 00:34:56.453]  We're locking down 800 homes and searching them without warrants.
[00:34:56.453 --> 00:34:57.774]  Totally illegal.
[00:34:57.774 --> 00:35:03.857]  We're looking for one kid, who we say is the bomber, who they really wanted to get rid of.
[00:35:03.857 --> 00:35:06.178]  Look how many other witnesses they did in the Boston bombing.
[00:35:06.178 --> 00:35:06.758]  And then, boom!
[00:35:06.758 --> 00:35:07.058]  Boom!
[00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:13.578]  They go and start searching everybody's houses without warrants.
[00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:16.405]  It's all a government orgy of power grab.
[00:35:16.405 --> 00:35:18.550]  Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.623]  This has happened over and over and over again.
[00:35:23.623 --> 00:35:29.588]  If common criminals could use the same excuses as the Obama administration, they would say, mistakes were made.
[00:35:29.588 --> 00:35:30.969]  What difference does it make?
[00:35:30.969 --> 00:35:32.470]  I know nothing.
[00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.991]  I did it for national security.
[00:35:33.991 --> 00:35:38.094]  I answered in the least untruthful manner possible.
[00:35:38.094 --> 00:35:40.356]  Yeah, the head of the NSA
[00:35:41.878 --> 00:35:50.671]  General Alexander came out last week and said, I apologize to Congress, what I said was completely erroneous.
[00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:56.880]  When he said to Congress, I heard them play that on the nightly news last Friday.
[00:35:57.824 --> 00:36:02.487]  We ought to cue up that clip that I saw them cover.
[00:36:02.487 --> 00:36:04.469]  It was an article on Infowars as well.
[00:36:04.469 --> 00:36:07.311]  I think it was head of NSA admits to lying to Congress.
[00:36:07.311 --> 00:36:08.532]  But the point is, it's very powerful.
[00:36:08.532 --> 00:36:12.634]  He goes, that statement could not have been more erroneous.
[00:36:12.634 --> 00:36:15.216]  We do spy on you without more insight.
[00:36:15.216 --> 00:36:16.077]  Well, of course you do.
[00:36:17.947 --> 00:36:23.751]  But see, they tried to have him go out and lie to see how it would work, and they went, Sir, no one is buying it.
[00:36:23.751 --> 00:36:25.893]  They all know you perjured yourself.
[00:36:25.893 --> 00:36:29.556]  Congress wants to act like they don't know what's going on because they're the real criminals.
[00:36:29.556 --> 00:36:31.577]  Oh, I know nothing as well.
[00:36:31.577 --> 00:36:36.541]  Oh, gee, we know nothing about the $500 billion in narcotics money each year made in the U.S.
[00:36:36.541 --> 00:36:38.502]  that's lining most of their pockets.
[00:36:38.502 --> 00:36:44.187]  Oh, gee, we don't know why we go to Congress worth a million and end up being worth $100, $200, $300 million.
[00:36:44.187 --> 00:36:46.909]  Gee, we don't know what's going on.
[00:36:47.389 --> 00:36:48.349]  We have no idea.
[00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:51.191]  Yeah, there's the headline.
[00:36:51.191 --> 00:36:53.252]  Intelligence chief.
[00:36:53.252 --> 00:36:54.552]  The head of cyber security.
[00:36:54.552 --> 00:36:55.953]  Yes, I lied to Congress.
[00:36:55.953 --> 00:36:57.554]  But here's why.
[00:36:57.554 --> 00:37:06.138]  I lied to you because I love you.
[00:37:06.138 --> 00:37:09.279]  He says, quote, it was clearly erroneous.
[00:37:09.279 --> 00:37:16.523]  So now we found the secret ingredient to eggs erroneous is is James Clapper.
[00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:21.860]  But also, Alexander has made similar statements.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.801]  So, there you go.
[00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:26.622]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[00:37:26.622 --> 00:37:27.802]  I mean, listen.
[00:37:27.802 --> 00:37:40.727]  This is textbook, wall-to-wall, insane asylum, Looney Tunes, off-the-chart, bunker world, cuckoo-cocoa-puff, crazy, insane tyranny going on.
[00:37:40.727 --> 00:37:43.428]  And now they're blowing up people's cars and saying,
[00:37:44.617 --> 00:37:48.140]  Oh, we've been told by unnamed group to not release the police report.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.802]  The police at least are going.
[00:37:49.802 --> 00:37:53.425]  We've been told not to give the media the police report.
[00:37:53.425 --> 00:37:55.526]  National security.
[00:37:55.526 --> 00:37:56.247]  They're after me.
[00:37:56.247 --> 00:37:57.228]  They're threatening to kill me.
[00:37:57.228 --> 00:37:58.009]  Biggest story ever.
[00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:58.829]  I'm about to break.
[00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:59.890]  I'm going off the radar.
[00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:00.971]  I'm going into hiding.
[00:38:00.971 --> 00:38:04.054]  Please protect my family.
[00:38:04.054 --> 00:38:08.338]  Oh, there's nothing going on here.
[00:38:08.338 --> 00:38:09.098]  Everything's fine here.
[00:38:09.098 --> 00:38:11.220]  Nothing to worry about.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:11.981]  I'll send a squad.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:17.583]  Oh no, actually, Major Reactor League, very dangerous.
[00:38:17.583 --> 00:38:19.204]  I'm laughing about this.
[00:38:19.204 --> 00:38:20.925]  This is crazy!
[00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:39.517]  But America had so much liberty, there's still this vestigial, skeletal structure of freedom and institutions that are left, but then you've got massive tyranny just growing like the blob at the end of the Steve McQueen movie, you know, the 1950s version, where it's eaten so many people now it's the size of
[00:38:40.796 --> 00:38:48.540]  You know, it's the size of the fire station coming down the street and we've got to turn this around somehow.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:59.264]  And again, I run into police and government people all over the country who are listeners and are aware and who are nice and I see cops changing people's tires.
[00:38:59.264 --> 00:39:02.366]  In fact, I'm going to tell the story now and then go to your calls.
[00:39:02.366 --> 00:39:04.407]  In the last month, I had dinner
[00:39:06.229 --> 00:39:15.777]  With a family acquaintance over the years, an old family friend, but when I say acquaintance, we've known him over the years, but off and on.
[00:39:15.777 --> 00:39:26.345]  And I had dinner and he said, no, listen, we get basically in trouble when we go out and change tires and help old ladies, you know, carry the trash out when we're on a call.
[00:39:26.345 --> 00:39:28.827]  We're not supposed to basically help people.
[00:39:28.827 --> 00:39:33.571]  We're supposed to go out and write tickets all day and just be visible out there to the public.
[00:39:34.983 --> 00:39:40.647]  And there's so much petty crime going on, because criminals won't do home invasions in Austin, Texas.
[00:39:40.647 --> 00:39:46.191]  There's so much petty crime going on that there's just nothing we can even do.
[00:39:46.191 --> 00:39:48.072]  He goes, the numbers you talk about, it's higher than that.
[00:39:48.072 --> 00:39:53.416]  It's just wall to wall, cars being broken into, bicycles being stolen.
[00:39:53.416 --> 00:39:56.338]  But the home invasions aren't up that much because they're scared of guns.
[00:39:58.522 --> 00:40:08.531]  And then I was separately talking to a very old family friend, oldest family friends we've got, and one of the younger brother is a mailman.
[00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:15.337]  He's about to retire, but he's one of the younger siblings in the family we've been friends with since I was born in Dallas, but they live down here now.
[00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:20.512]  And he's a mailman in a town outside Austin.
[00:40:20.512 --> 00:40:21.913]  He's retiring in two years.
[00:40:21.913 --> 00:40:26.616]  By the way, they're already giving him IOUs on their pensions and telling him they're not going to get him.
[00:40:26.616 --> 00:40:34.961]  And he's almost been fired three times because he'll go to these shut-ins houses and there's piled up trash.
[00:40:34.961 --> 00:40:36.321]  The old woman's in a wheelchair.
[00:40:36.321 --> 00:40:40.384]  Her kids won't come see her and help her.
[00:40:40.384 --> 00:40:43.866]  They'll ask, hey, will you please help me carry my trash to the curb?
[00:40:45.751 --> 00:40:47.079]  And so they have spies!
[00:40:48.641 --> 00:40:53.625]  Citizen spies and government spies watching the male men and women.
[00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:58.509]  So now he's sitting there going, I'm sorry, I can't open that can of peas for you.
[00:40:58.509 --> 00:41:05.915]  I'm sorry, I can't carry the trash out, even though it takes him five seconds to get rid of the male and then carry the trash out the same distance.
[00:41:05.915 --> 00:41:06.976]  I can't help you.
[00:41:06.976 --> 00:41:08.677]  And he has to wear GPS.
[00:41:08.677 --> 00:41:10.819]  They all wear GPS now.
[00:41:10.819 --> 00:41:13.841]  And the cops are going to get this too, where they can't be good.
[00:41:13.841 --> 00:41:17.985]  See, the government wants to promote the crazy foaming at the mouth
[00:41:18.445 --> 00:41:20.486]  Nuttoid kooks.
[00:41:20.486 --> 00:41:23.247]  And by the way, where I live, it's not that bad.
[00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:25.228]  The Travis County Sheriff's Department's not that bad.
[00:41:25.228 --> 00:41:31.311]  The Austin Police Department isn't that bad, compared to the state police, who didn't used to be that bad.
[00:41:31.311 --> 00:41:38.054]  But I mean, I see the marked difference, where you have some weird checkpoint going on.
[00:41:38.054 --> 00:41:40.035]  You park your car, walk up, hey, what's going on?
[00:41:40.035 --> 00:41:41.976]  Get in your car and get out of here!
[00:41:41.976 --> 00:41:43.797]  Just wanting to attack me.
[00:41:43.797 --> 00:41:45.498]  And I'm like, man, this is really a nut.
[00:41:46.465 --> 00:41:52.046]  This is really a dangerous lunatic, who shouldn't have a badge, shouldn't have a gun.
[00:41:52.046 --> 00:41:57.287]  And the other state police were standing around kind of embarrassed, looking at him, like, why is he acting like that?
[00:41:57.287 --> 00:42:00.307]  But of course, he was the one in command.
[00:42:00.307 --> 00:42:01.748]  He was the one in charge.
[00:42:01.748 --> 00:42:05.768]  And look, I'm 5'11", and I don't have a Napoleonic complex.
[00:42:05.768 --> 00:42:11.009]  I don't think of myself as really short, but I kind of walk around like a gorilla, kind of bent over half the time now.
[00:42:11.009 --> 00:42:13.510]  So people, you know, say, hey, you know,
[00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.191]  It was funny.
[00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:17.491]  Professor Griff goes, I like you.
[00:42:17.491 --> 00:42:19.192]  You're not too tall.
[00:42:19.192 --> 00:42:19.852]  He's a funny guy.
[00:42:19.852 --> 00:42:24.374]  It reminded me of Time Bandits where Napoleon sang, little people, I like you.
[00:42:24.374 --> 00:42:28.316]  But side issue, you have to see that film to know what I'm talking about.
[00:42:28.316 --> 00:42:30.777]  But this guy looked like he was about 5'3".
[00:42:30.777 --> 00:42:36.440]  I guess he had an issue with his Napoleonic shortness like Yosemite Sam and just blew up at me.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:43.403]  And again, the science, I don't recommend you do this, but I am going to go out soon with a film crew
[00:42:45.226 --> 00:43:00.505]  And I'm gonna drive by, find a group of cops sitting around talking, I'm gonna have the other car drive down a few hundred yards ahead of me, turn around to time it, to pull up and park across the street right as I get out, and walk over nicely, and say, hi officers, how's it going?
[00:43:00.505 --> 00:43:03.489]  With a camera, and then go, mind if I search your vehicle?
[00:43:04.943 --> 00:43:06.924]  They're going to flip out on me.
[00:43:06.924 --> 00:43:12.088]  I guarantee you that half the cops out there will probably take me to jail.
[00:43:12.088 --> 00:43:15.170]  The other half will say, laugh at me and know who I am.
[00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:19.893]  But the point is, is that see how we've got the mindset so turned around?
[00:43:19.893 --> 00:43:25.717]  If you tried to randomly pull somebody over 50 years ago and say, I'm going to search your vehicle, they'd say, well, this is America, buddy.
[00:43:25.717 --> 00:43:26.358]  This ain't Russia.
[00:43:29.093 --> 00:43:41.378]  But now it's, I'm going to search your vehicle in this video with the two women coming from the beach in Galveston up to Houston and the male cops are like, I'm going to search your vehicle.
[00:43:41.378 --> 00:43:42.419]  They don't even ask.
[00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:45.660]  They search it and they go, all right, I'm going to do a cavity search.
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:49.542]  And these women are in bikinis and they're like, you're joking.
[00:43:49.542 --> 00:43:53.463]  The cop goes, I ain't joking with you lady.
[00:43:53.463 --> 00:43:54.524]  And I'm telling you folks,
[00:43:56.246 --> 00:43:58.747]  I'm telling you, the TSA already does this to little kids.
[00:43:58.747 --> 00:44:01.548]  You're not sticking your finger in me.
[00:44:01.548 --> 00:44:03.728]  I'm just telling you right now.
[00:44:03.728 --> 00:44:10.010]  I mean, Jesse Ventura has basically left the country because of them grabbing his hind end.
[00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.350]  People go, oh, big deal.
[00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:12.451]  What's the big deal?
[00:44:12.451 --> 00:44:16.552]  If you do that to somebody in a park, you get like five years in prison, and you should.
[00:44:16.552 --> 00:44:21.693]  I mean, when you go to the TSA, folks, they run their hand up in your butt crack.
[00:44:21.693 --> 00:44:24.034]  I hate to talk about this on air, but this is just, you know,
[00:44:25.245 --> 00:44:27.767]  Scientific, you know, reporting here on what's going on.
[00:44:27.767 --> 00:44:29.928]  It's documentary.
[00:44:29.928 --> 00:44:32.510]  Not meant for purposes of obscenity.
[00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:38.094]  You notice while on NPR or PBS sometimes they can have cussing and racist stuff on there because it's documentary.
[00:44:38.094 --> 00:44:39.295]  They're showing you what really happened.
[00:44:39.295 --> 00:44:45.900]  It's like if you're watching a trial on court TV and what was said is said.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.361]  Just like when the defense lawyers for
[00:44:50.259 --> 00:44:50.559]  O.J.
[00:44:50.559 --> 00:44:52.380]  Simpson, you know, we're using the N-word.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.502]  The point is they were documenting what was being said.
[00:44:55.502 --> 00:44:57.483]  Repeating what had been reported to be said.
[00:44:57.483 --> 00:44:59.024]  So, I'm not even going to get graphic here.
[00:44:59.024 --> 00:45:05.548]  The point is, Miss USA, they went in her pants, and then into her body.
[00:45:05.548 --> 00:45:09.691]  And how screwed up is it, these cops looking for marijuana,
[00:45:16.158 --> 00:45:18.739]  Yeah, and there's the woman, like, kind of crying and freaking out.
[00:45:18.739 --> 00:45:38.930]  We just showed some video of it, where she's like, I can't believe that this woman is, like, handcuffed, and then they're gonna... And imagine, a woman's handcuffed, and then cops are gonna go in her body to see if she's shoved a joint inside of herself.
[00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:39.430]  That's enough.
[00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:40.170]  I can't watch anymore.
[00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:40.931]  Just get it off the screen.
[00:45:41.616 --> 00:45:51.506]  Yeah, there's the footage of the other women in North Texas, outside Dallas, where the woman, you can see her, the woman cop, the other woman, has the woman bend over, and then shoves her hand in her.
[00:45:51.506 --> 00:45:54.188]  I mean, this is rape, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:54.188 --> 00:45:56.310]  But, it's a cop doing it, so it's okay.
[00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:01.035]  Alright, I didn't mean to digress off into this, I know I did it yesterday.
[00:46:01.035 --> 00:46:03.017]  It's just, it's really starting to flip me out.
[00:46:06.738 --> 00:46:07.899]  And it's all color law.
[00:46:07.899 --> 00:46:09.761]  Used to, mind if I search?
[00:46:09.761 --> 00:46:14.006]  Man, if you say, sure, go ahead, you're going to be there an hour.
[00:46:14.006 --> 00:46:20.052]  It's a violent... Now it's just, I'm going to search, and if you say you don't have a right, they pull a taser out and shoot you.
[00:46:20.052 --> 00:46:20.953]  I see this all the time.
[00:46:20.953 --> 00:46:25.017]  You've seen it.
[00:46:25.017 --> 00:46:26.699]  And if you try to resist being assaulted,
[00:46:28.075 --> 00:46:32.240]  Imagine if they got your ten-year-old daughter out and did this and you said, no you're not, they'll taser you.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.861]  You try to defend your daughter, they'll kill you.
[00:46:33.861 --> 00:46:36.284]  Your wife tries to defend, she's gonna go six feet under.
[00:46:36.284 --> 00:46:38.586]  They're gonna stick their hand in your hind end.
[00:46:39.534 --> 00:46:40.955]  Because that's their power.
[00:46:40.955 --> 00:46:42.356]  That's their domination.
[00:46:42.356 --> 00:46:55.266]  That's them showing you when it's an indicted, criminal, merciless, offshore banking cartel that ships in the narcotics, runs the sex slavery, runs the gambling.
[00:46:55.266 --> 00:46:56.948]  They run it all, folks.
[00:46:56.948 --> 00:47:02.272]  And the police now, whether they know it or not, work for organized crime that hijacked America.
[00:47:02.692 --> 00:47:07.274]  I think that right now the question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[00:47:07.274 --> 00:47:10.054]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[00:47:10.054 --> 00:47:12.195]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:47:12.195 --> 00:47:15.076]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[00:47:15.076 --> 00:47:19.657]  Jim Urio, you say we've got some downside here, a correction in the markets.
[00:47:19.657 --> 00:47:20.338]  Fine.
[00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:23.919]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:47:23.919 --> 00:47:27.320]  Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.424]  And that we won't go any lower than, say, 5% down from here.
[00:47:32.424 --> 00:47:36.987]  Of course we are, because if we look at the economic data, there's nothing to get excited about in that.
[00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:43.152]  So yesterday we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand their balance sheets and pump more money in.
[00:47:43.152 --> 00:47:48.335]  But the stock market knows that reluctance is totally different than not willing to do it at all.
[00:47:48.335 --> 00:47:54.260]  And that's why we saw oil implode and gold trade off heavily, because they're not a protected class.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.721]  If the stock market starts trading off,
[00:47:56.361 --> 00:47:59.904]  10 to 15 to 20 percent area, the chairman's gonna come in and throw some stimulus at us.
[00:47:59.904 --> 00:48:04.086]  So, to answer your question, we are absolutely slaves to central banks.
[00:48:04.086 --> 00:48:08.289]  And we'd love to be slaves of the economy, but the economic numbers continue to do nothing but trend lower.
[00:48:08.289 --> 00:48:10.731]  Mr. LeCam, do we work for the central bankers?
[00:48:11.898 --> 00:48:15.382]  There you go.
[00:48:15.382 --> 00:48:16.563]  Let's see NBC.
[00:48:16.563 --> 00:48:19.806]  Folks, I know what I'm telling you sounds crazy.
[00:48:19.806 --> 00:48:23.049]  Doesn't what you know about the Soviet Union sound crazy, but it happened?
[00:48:23.049 --> 00:48:25.472]  Nazi Germany sounds crazy, it happened?
[00:48:25.472 --> 00:48:28.335]  All the hundreds of dictators you know about, it happened.
[00:48:28.335 --> 00:48:33.340]  I'm telling you, this is how it happens when people worship authority and do whatever it says.
[00:48:34.494 --> 00:48:41.277]  And I think about how we have this video that I saw get posted yesterday of a Toronto police officer helping a homeless woman.
[00:48:41.277 --> 00:48:43.818]  We just posted it on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:43.818 --> 00:48:44.898]  Nobody's watching it.
[00:48:44.898 --> 00:48:46.699]  Nobody cares.
[00:48:46.699 --> 00:48:51.001]  Nobody wants to see it.
[00:48:51.001 --> 00:48:56.563]  And then when police act like humanitarians, they get in trouble in this country, on average.
[00:48:56.563 --> 00:48:59.244]  Now, some departments are better.
[00:48:59.244 --> 00:49:02.845]  But that's because the system does not want the cops being friends with the people.
[00:49:02.845 --> 00:49:03.646]  They do not want
[00:49:04.326 --> 00:49:06.248]  A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A
[00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:29.789]  Other insane news.
[00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:33.656]  Just briefly, we have the very best water filtration system.
[00:49:33.656 --> 00:49:35.058]  I did research for my family.
[00:49:35.058 --> 00:49:35.679]  I did research.
[00:49:36.992 --> 00:49:41.576]  The very best gravity fed portable but also great in your office or restaurant wherever.
[00:49:41.576 --> 00:49:46.360]  Gravity fed system that does tens of thousands of gallons before you have to replace the gravity fed filters.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.183]  It's impregnated with colloidal silver and so much more.
[00:49:49.183 --> 00:49:54.608]  Look at the side-by-side comparisons at InfowarsStore.com to the competition and annihilate some.
[00:49:54.608 --> 00:49:57.791]  We already have the lowest price of Pro-Pure anywhere but with the promo code
[00:49:58.707 --> 00:49:59.108]  Water.
[00:49:59.108 --> 00:50:00.309]  You get 10% off.

[00:53:31.986 --> 00:53:34.567]  And without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[00:53:34.567 --> 00:53:40.368]  Maser instruments detect all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[00:53:40.368 --> 00:53:42.788]  And are always on, just like your smoke alarm.
[00:53:42.788 --> 00:53:45.689]  Detecting, measuring, and monitoring nuclear radiation.
[00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:46.709]  Made in America.
[00:53:46.709 --> 00:53:47.729]  Laboratory grade.
[00:53:47.729 --> 00:53:49.009]  And EMP resistant.
[00:53:49.009 --> 00:53:53.030]  If you can't reliably measure nuclear radiation, you're not fully prepared.
[00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:54.390]  But now you can be.
[00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.131]  At Maser Instruments dot com.
[00:53:56.131 --> 00:53:57.571]  Spelled M-A-Z-U-R.
[00:53:57.571 --> 00:53:58.631]  Instruments dot com.
[00:54:07.608 --> 00:54:08.469]  Here's a headline.
[00:54:08.469 --> 00:54:12.553]  Sheriff's office to pay one million for inmates' death.
[00:54:12.553 --> 00:54:13.494]  And the banks love that.
[00:54:13.494 --> 00:54:15.456]  They run all these major cities.
[00:54:15.456 --> 00:54:19.600]  That'll just put people into deeper bankruptcy to the globalists.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.781]  It's all fiat money.
[00:54:20.781 --> 00:54:21.963]  That's out of Tampa, Florida.
[00:54:25.242 --> 00:54:29.165]  It's a mistake at the Orient Road Jail in Hillsborough County.
[00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:30.446]  Proved costly $1,000,000.
[00:54:30.446 --> 00:54:38.031]  That's how much the Sheriff's Office and the private company that provides medical care for inmates will pay for the family of 51-year-old Alan Hicks.
[00:54:38.031 --> 00:54:45.837]  The popular baseball coach died last year after suffering a stroke and spending 36 hours in the jail without treatment.
[00:54:45.837 --> 00:54:47.438]  Awww.
[00:54:47.438 --> 00:54:48.319]  That is sad, isn't it?
[00:54:51.718 --> 00:54:54.980]  That's just some of the news that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:55:01.504]  And again, can you imagine if you pulled up behind a cop and shined a spotlight on him and then said, pull over?
[00:55:01.504 --> 00:55:03.145]  They'd jump out and probably shoot you.
[00:55:03.145 --> 00:55:10.449]  Or if a gang of ten citizens came up to a police car and got around him and said, we want to search your vehicle!
[00:55:10.449 --> 00:55:11.870]  We think you might have done something!
[00:55:13.186 --> 00:55:15.009]  The cop would flip out.
[00:55:15.009 --> 00:55:16.392]  How do we put up with that?
[00:55:16.392 --> 00:55:19.017]  We're not criminals, but that's what America is now.
[00:55:19.017 --> 00:55:23.025]  That's what a tyranny is, where we're all scum and the government's God.
[00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:30.012]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, and I'm going to continue right through the next hour with them.
[00:55:30.012 --> 00:55:35.235]  And then I'm going to get into heart-eating cannibal demands Obama send weapons.
[00:55:35.235 --> 00:55:39.397]  If we don't get help, no-flies-don't-have-your-weapons, we will do worse than I did.
[00:55:39.397 --> 00:55:43.299]  You've seen nothing yet, and promises to eat more hearts.
[00:55:43.299 --> 00:55:45.841]  These are people killing Christians and throwing them off rooftops.
[00:55:47.073 --> 00:55:49.013]  This is mainstream news, folks.
[00:55:49.013 --> 00:55:50.454]  This is who our government's supporting.
[00:55:50.454 --> 00:55:57.636]  Because our government is cold-blooded offshore banks, who know that even if the government gets brought down here, it'll just be the government.
[00:55:57.636 --> 00:55:58.676]  They're offshore.
[00:55:58.676 --> 00:56:00.656]  They've got diplomatic immunity.
[00:56:00.656 --> 00:56:04.197]  That's why things are getting so crazy, because they get away with anything.
[00:56:04.197 --> 00:56:15.260]  And if you study criminology, the criminal mindset, whether it's on the street or running a big bank, will always try to get caught and destroy itself, and will act out until it's brought down.
[00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:19.193]  Let's go to John in Illinois.
[00:56:19.193 --> 00:56:23.263]  You want to talk about the police state, which I've kind of been on a jag about the last few days.
[00:56:23.263 --> 00:56:23.644]  Go ahead.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.441]  Alex, I'm a first-time caller, a 10-year listener.
[00:56:27.441 --> 00:56:28.602]  Welcome.
[00:56:28.602 --> 00:56:29.042]  Thank you.
[00:56:29.042 --> 00:56:31.763]  And I wanted to call and basically share a quick story.
[00:56:31.763 --> 00:56:36.185]  I had been caught up in an online check scam where I received a rubber check.
[00:56:36.185 --> 00:56:38.426]  I had to make a police report about this.
[00:56:38.426 --> 00:56:45.049]  And so I called the local police department here in Champaign, Illinois, and I was sitting outside on my porch with my laptop and all the records I needed.
[00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:46.370]  This officer pulled up.
[00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:51.452]  He sat behind my car for about 20 minutes and ran my plate and everything in full view of me.
[00:56:52.225 --> 00:56:58.668]  Then finally got out, came up to the car with his hand on his gun, a really big tattooed, you could tell he was ex-military.
[00:56:58.668 --> 00:57:03.330]  And he was basically talking down to me before he even asked me what I had called him for.
[00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:07.712]  I know, it's all trying- well, you're a Fallujah resident.
[00:57:07.712 --> 00:57:12.734]  He was basically demanding my ID and I explained to him my children are inside asleep.
[00:57:12.734 --> 00:57:13.434]  I'd rather not.
[00:57:13.434 --> 00:57:15.855]  He asked me if there was something I was hiding from him inside.
[00:57:15.855 --> 00:57:21.518]  I told him I didn't think my children would appreciate waking up to a six-foot robot with a gun in my living room.
[00:57:22.376 --> 00:57:24.560]  And at that he kind of chuckled and he eased off.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.163]  He followed my report.
[00:57:26.163 --> 00:57:33.996]  And basically after he followed the report, at the end he was saying, if anything on... I didn't hang up on you, John.
[00:57:33.996 --> 00:57:35.218]  You got somebody calling.
[00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:35.940]  You want to take that call?
[00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:37.453]  Oh, no, thank you.
[00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:43.396]  He said, basically, if anybody is offering you anything online, it's a scam and a sucker's born every day.
[00:57:43.396 --> 00:57:47.297]  At this, I brought up how he is losing his pension fund.
[00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:54.440]  And he stopped for a moment and said that they have conspiracy theorists in the department like everywhere else, but he would have to look into this.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.781]  I told him it's all over the internet.
[00:57:55.781 --> 00:57:56.681]  Take a look.
[00:57:56.681 --> 00:58:00.983]  Later on that night, I... Yeah.
[00:58:00.983 --> 00:58:02.323]  ...more civil with me.
[00:58:02.323 --> 00:58:04.444]  Yeah, you want to flip over and talk to that person real quick?
[00:58:06.162 --> 00:58:08.132]  Uh, there's no other call coming in.
[00:58:08.132 --> 00:58:08.835]  Oh, okay.
[00:58:10.434 --> 00:58:16.378]  Anyways, later on that night... I thanked him for, you know, basically becoming more civil with me.
[00:58:16.378 --> 00:58:19.060]  At the next day, he showed up to my wife's job.
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:23.262]  She's a leasing manager at an apartment where a drunk woman was acting violent.
[00:58:23.262 --> 00:58:38.071]  He basically neutralized the situation, was very convivial, he was comical, he escorted her back to her house... No, no, we need to engage these police, because no one has ever... Everyone grovels to them, and if you grovel, it automatically turns them into predators.
[00:58:38.071 --> 00:58:39.032]  It's animal psychology.
[00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:46.697]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.209 --> 00:58:54.090]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:59.592]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:58:59.592 --> 00:59:07.334]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:59:07.334 --> 00:59:16.436]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:59:16.636 --> 00:59:23.799]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:59:23.799 --> 00:59:26.681]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:59:26.681 --> 00:59:33.604]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[00:59:34.204 --> 00:59:35.245]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:59:35.245 --> 00:59:36.546]  Another plane just hit!
[01:00:04.861 --> 01:00:09.683]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.683 --> 01:00:11.264]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.264 --> 01:00:12.825]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.825 --> 01:00:17.007]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.007 --> 01:00:21.089]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.337 --> 01:00:43.620]  Alright, I said I'd take your questions, and so we'd have wildcard points that are brought up.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.622]  The last caller was telling a story, which is fine too.
[01:00:46.622 --> 01:00:48.944]  We're taking first-time callers right now.
[01:00:48.944 --> 01:00:51.125]  I want to take a ton of your calls.
[01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:52.626]  I'm going to try my best.
[01:00:52.626 --> 01:00:54.747]  And then I'm going to get to this story.
[01:00:54.747 --> 01:01:04.954]  I saw this a few days ago, but then looked at the video closer, and these people are serious pro-abortion activists at the Texas Capitol, where they're having a big battle, where Texas is trying to ban
[01:01:05.799 --> 01:01:06.759]  Partial birth abortion.
[01:01:06.759 --> 01:01:07.959]  I mean, why not?
[01:01:07.959 --> 01:01:10.540]  It's easier to just deliver the baby.
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.060]  And then just give it up for adoption.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.161]  These are survivable babies.
[01:01:14.161 --> 01:01:16.681]  This is clear murder.
[01:01:16.681 --> 01:01:19.722]  And the left is acting like it's their new civil rights crusade.
[01:01:19.722 --> 01:01:26.383]  They go up to harass the pro-lifers and chant, Hail Satan, Hail Satan.
[01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:31.124]  And I gotta be honest with you folks, I protested abortion clinics years ago.
[01:01:31.124 --> 01:01:32.644]  You're on back like 18 years ago.
[01:01:33.909 --> 01:01:36.951]  And I would have people come over and say things like this to me.
[01:01:36.951 --> 01:01:41.094]  So you gotta understand, there are Satanists, and these are holy facilities.
[01:01:41.094 --> 01:01:42.775]  That's why it's come out with a lot of them.
[01:01:42.775 --> 01:01:47.058]  You can look this up, where abortionists, a lot of times it turns out, are actually Satanists.
[01:01:47.058 --> 01:01:57.645]  That's a pro-lifer speaking on the soapbox.
[01:01:57.645 --> 01:01:59.226]  And the people around her chanting, Hell Satan.
[01:02:03.058 --> 01:02:04.239]  The procedure's the same.
[01:02:04.239 --> 01:02:06.141]  The instruments are the same.
[01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:08.223]  They let him into the front door.
[01:02:08.223 --> 01:02:09.484]  That's the difference.
[01:02:09.484 --> 01:02:11.425]  Carmen Gosnell butchered women.
[01:02:11.425 --> 01:02:12.386]  Butchered children.
[01:02:12.386 --> 01:02:14.668]  We have carpets down in Houston.
[01:02:14.668 --> 01:02:15.629]  Butchering women.
[01:02:15.629 --> 01:02:16.770]  Butchering children.
[01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:30.038]  And again, listening to it on the radio, you can go watch the video, you have to listen carefully, but the news reported they were saying, Hail Satan.
[01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:31.078]  If you listen, it's like a church.
[01:02:31.078 --> 01:02:35.460]  They're going, Hail Satan, Hail Satan, Hail Satan.
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.462]  Because they were, I'm sure, do it quite well at their meetings.
[01:02:39.462 --> 01:02:41.083]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peter.
[01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:42.063]  Peter, what's your question?
[01:02:42.063 --> 01:02:44.184]  Go ahead.
[01:02:44.184 --> 01:02:45.164]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:45.164 --> 01:02:46.945]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:46.945 --> 01:02:51.327]  Hey, I just want to thank you for your great show that you always put on.
[01:02:52.356 --> 01:02:54.177]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:02:54.177 --> 01:02:57.418]  I've been listening to you for about three years.
[01:02:57.418 --> 01:03:06.921]  And one of the things I wanted to say was, you know, you sometimes bring up your faith on the show.
[01:03:06.921 --> 01:03:12.823]  And you are one of the reasons I went back to God.
[01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:21.706]  And because of the reasons, the fact that you showed everybody, you show everybody that we're free people to do what we want.
[01:03:22.722 --> 01:03:25.424]  And I want to thank you for that Alex.
[01:03:25.424 --> 01:03:26.845]  Well thank you.
[01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:37.573]  The difference is I'm not a Pharisee praying in public and up on the hill and beating people over the head with the man-made twisted garbage they put out.
[01:03:37.573 --> 01:03:49.722]  But the truth is there are spiritual forces in this world of good and evil and the globalists don't want you to be aware of that because if you're not aware of it you're basically spiritually blind and they can enslave you.
[01:03:49.722 --> 01:03:49.982]  Correct.
[01:03:52.006 --> 01:04:04.849]  have been so woken up by the sobering facts that come out of your show that how could you not realize that there is a war in our souls between good and evil?
[01:04:04.849 --> 01:04:14.111]  And we have to step up, realize that God is real, and we have to give him the praise for all our battles that we do.
[01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:25.631]  Sure, but at the same time, give praise not to these establishment churches that tell you worship the government.
[01:04:25.631 --> 01:04:28.292]  They now have turned God into the government.
[01:04:28.292 --> 01:04:32.054]  I mean, you go to most of these churches, you get a sermon on licking boots all day.
[01:04:32.054 --> 01:04:34.895]  And probably they'll explain to you that it's up to the Lord to bend over.
[01:04:36.263 --> 01:04:38.144]  Have them do proctology exams.
[01:04:38.144 --> 01:04:43.708]  Most churches now teach that Christians were wrong to not worship idols and to be thrown to the lions.
[01:04:43.708 --> 01:04:44.929]  You can type that in.
[01:04:44.929 --> 01:04:52.914]  Preacher teaches Christians should have done what Caesar said and not been thrown to lions.
[01:04:52.914 --> 01:04:54.936]  These are demons, a bunch of them.
[01:04:54.936 --> 01:04:55.676]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:55.676 --> 01:04:56.557]  Thank you so much for the call.

[01:06:03.718 --> 01:06:06.358]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[01:06:06.358 --> 01:06:09.599]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:13.060]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:19.282]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.

[01:08:11.406 --> 01:08:12.948]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.948 --> 01:08:17.132]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.132 --> 01:08:21.196]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.295 --> 01:08:26.356]  There's a whole bunch of these videos.
[01:08:26.356 --> 01:08:33.820]  The one that's currently in the Mike Adams story is a great story, but it's not extremely audible on the radio.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:42.565]  We just found a bunch of clips, because I heard them on the radio locally a few days ago, where the women run up and demonically stick their tongues out and scream, Hail Satan!
[01:08:43.545 --> 01:09:02.375]  At Christians that had gotten their time in the Capitol open-air rotunda to pray for the babies they're killing, the Democrats began just screaming over and over again, Hail Satan, and sticking their tongues out.
[01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:07.277]  Yeah, back that up about 30 seconds and let's play that so people can hear them.
[01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:09.058]  First it starts with a loving chant.
[01:09:14.701 --> 01:09:22.966]  You have the Christians singing.
[01:09:22.966 --> 01:09:25.067]  They're singing Amazing Grace.
[01:09:25.067 --> 01:09:33.592]  And outside are people ringing, chanting Hail Satan.
[01:09:33.592 --> 01:09:36.574]  And then women run through the police to stick their tongues out.
[01:09:39.326 --> 01:09:40.387]  Hail Satan!
[01:09:40.387 --> 01:09:41.988]  Let me tell you something, ladies.
[01:09:41.988 --> 01:09:44.409]  You better back out of Satan real quick.
[01:09:44.409 --> 01:09:49.052]  Because I know the TV tells you that's how you get power and it's cute and funny.
[01:09:49.052 --> 01:09:53.555]  You're going to be begging, begging for God's help soon enough.
[01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:57.257]  And believe me, Satan is not going to answer your call.
[01:09:57.257 --> 01:10:00.719]  Satan will only give you limited temporal power to suck you in.
[01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:06.103]  It's like a bait, a lure that looks like a tasty fish or a tasty worm, but it's got hooks in it.
[01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:18.565]  And the woman with just an absolute Jezebel spirit running around with her tongue out and encircling the Christians just chanting, Hail Satan, Hail Satan.
[01:10:18.565 --> 01:10:23.487]  Here's the article by Mike Adams at InfoWars.com and NaturalNews.com.
[01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:29.451]  Abortion activist caught on camera possessed by spooky Hail Satan chant at Texas State Capitol.
[01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:39.794]  Yeah, and the video he's got is when they're chanting, low, Hail Satan, Hail Satan, Hail Satan, which is the real way it's done, by the way.
[01:10:39.794 --> 01:10:42.296]  This is the real deal.
[01:10:42.296 --> 01:10:51.784]  You may have heard that Texas is seeking to outlaw late-term abortions, the kind of abortions that kill an early full-grown baby who has eyes, ears, hands, a beating heart, and can experience pain.
[01:10:51.784 --> 01:10:53.746]  And the babies fight the knife.
[01:10:53.746 --> 01:10:57.289]  That's why there's famous online videos of that.
[01:10:57.289 --> 01:10:58.309]  They don't want you seeing those.
[01:10:59.318 --> 01:11:12.002]  The idea that such pre-born human beings cannot be murdered at will infuriates pro-choice abortion activists and the true inspiration for their desire to kill babies has finally emerged.
[01:11:12.002 --> 01:11:21.245]  A truly bizarre, almost creepy video has surfaced revealing pro-abortion activists chanting Hail Satan in unison at the Texas State Capitol.
[01:11:21.245 --> 01:11:25.706]  As you can hear for yourself in the video below, people in the background began chanting Hail Satan.
[01:11:26.266 --> 01:11:31.948]  During the speech of a woman who opposes late-term abortions, it appears at 5.12 in the video.
[01:11:31.948 --> 01:11:33.928]  See, Mike has one video where they're chanting.
[01:11:33.928 --> 01:11:34.728]  We found a bunch.
[01:11:34.728 --> 01:11:41.670]  This is what they chant in the rotunda at the legislature as they try to ban it.
[01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:48.992]  So we're going to add a bunch of videos to Mike Adams' thing so you can see hours of Hail Satan, if you'd like.
[01:11:48.992 --> 01:11:50.733]  And some will say, oh, they're just joking.
[01:11:50.733 --> 01:11:54.294]  Yeah, no, they're not just joking.
[01:11:54.294 --> 01:11:55.074]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:11:56.255 --> 01:11:59.256]  Why do you think they're sexualizing children at age five?
[01:11:59.256 --> 01:12:04.959]  Why do you think Nickelodeon four years ago came out and said, we're going to sexualize preteens?
[01:12:04.959 --> 01:12:10.442]  Why do you think you go to the store and the clothes for young girls looks like something that a prostitute would wear?
[01:12:10.442 --> 01:12:13.563]  Because they're on record saying they will wreck the innocence.
[01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:15.624]  They don't want children to be able to develop.
[01:12:15.624 --> 01:12:17.285]  They want to wreck them early.
[01:12:17.285 --> 01:12:21.927]  And all the studies show, single family, three to four times more likely to be in jail or on drugs.
[01:12:23.851 --> 01:12:26.292]  You don't live as long.
[01:12:26.292 --> 01:12:33.237]  If you aren't taught basic morals, then you will basically put up with anything.
[01:12:33.237 --> 01:12:35.518]  And so that's why these are sickos.
[01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:41.081]  They get the thrill of corrupting people.
[01:12:41.081 --> 01:12:52.328]  I mean, I've had the experience before in Hollywood where people basically explain that
[01:12:53.393 --> 01:12:55.875]  The fun is corrupting somebody.
[01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:59.117]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:12:59.117 --> 01:13:06.202]  And these people aren't even trying to set you up in something.
[01:13:06.202 --> 01:13:08.224]  You know, women, whatever.
[01:13:11.422 --> 01:13:19.911]  It's just the fact that if you're a married man, they want you to cheat on your wife because that's fun to break up a family.
[01:13:19.911 --> 01:13:21.753]  And then it just goes downhill from there.
[01:13:21.753 --> 01:13:23.635]  And these people have nothing.
[01:13:23.635 --> 01:13:26.018]  They get into evil, it doesn't fulfill them.
[01:13:26.018 --> 01:13:29.021]  So they think if I get into more evil, it's going to fulfill me.
[01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:38.220]  I said I'd go to your phone calls, we're going to go to them, but here's another article at Infowars.com.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:42.542]  IVF designer babies and three parent babies raise serious ethical questions.
[01:13:42.542 --> 01:13:44.123]  Think so?
[01:13:44.123 --> 01:13:47.425]  Will these even be classic humans as we know them?
[01:13:47.425 --> 01:13:54.048]  And they're introducing chemicals and biologicals in the environment where we're not going to be able to have traditional children soon.
[01:13:54.048 --> 01:13:57.149]  And then you'll have to go to the government to have your designer baby made.
[01:13:57.149 --> 01:14:01.892]  That's always been the plan, according to Julian Huxley at the United Nations.
[01:14:02.947 --> 01:14:05.731]  The head of UNESCO.
[01:14:05.731 --> 01:14:13.821]  This is beyond anything the average person can even imagine.
[01:14:13.821 --> 01:14:15.644]  Let's go to Dominique in Texas.
[01:14:15.644 --> 01:14:17.827]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:14:17.827 --> 01:14:18.567]  Hi Alex.
[01:14:18.567 --> 01:14:18.828]  Hey buddy.
[01:14:20.224 --> 01:14:22.565]  First time caller, long time listener.
[01:14:22.565 --> 01:14:26.247]  I wanted to ask you about the FEMA camps, the tent city in Raymondville.
[01:14:26.247 --> 01:14:31.190]  I believe you passed through here one time when you were going on 77 back to Austin.
[01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:34.011]  You passed one of those imperial checkpoints.
[01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:36.912]  It's illegally 100 miles, you know, in the border of Texas.
[01:14:36.912 --> 01:14:38.453]  Yes.
[01:14:38.453 --> 01:14:39.534]  What can you tell me about those?
[01:14:41.257 --> 01:14:44.380]  Well, I mean, they have the Constitution freeze zone a hundred miles into the country.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.882]  They let the drugs and the illegals through.
[01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:49.265]  It's only there for slave trading to shake down U.S.
[01:14:49.265 --> 01:14:50.105]  citizens.
[01:14:50.105 --> 01:14:57.352]  The Border Patrol's been on record basically admitting that and complaining about it because they like to actually protect the country's border.
[01:14:57.352 --> 01:15:01.136]  And under Rex 84 that was declassified in 1986 in the Iran-Contra hearings,
[01:15:03.444 --> 01:15:23.051]  They built FEMA centers under the guise of keeping immigrants, which they prime the pump with, but under the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, and the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, and the Emergency Centers Establishment Act, those are the official FEMA centers that they admit are for the American people.
[01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:26.912]  But John Corzine will not face criminal charges over MF Global.
[01:15:26.912 --> 01:15:30.834]  They did a fake federal lawsuit just to act like they were going to do something, as we predicted.
[01:15:32.138 --> 01:15:33.864]  And now nothing will be done to him.
[01:15:33.864 --> 01:15:35.368]  Stealing millions of dollars.
[01:15:35.368 --> 01:15:37.014]  The former head of Goldman Sachs.
[01:15:37.014 --> 01:15:38.940]  This is the type of garbage we're talking about, sir.
[01:15:40.325 --> 01:15:41.626]  That's just, that's just crazy.
[01:15:41.626 --> 01:15:43.127]  I mean, they're militarizing the police.
[01:15:43.127 --> 01:15:45.889]  They got cameras all over the city and in the city park now.
[01:15:45.889 --> 01:15:47.130]  It's just, it's getting crazy.
[01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:52.874]  No, no, they admit it is a Pentagon designed, DARPA designed grid and we are the enemy.
[01:15:52.874 --> 01:16:05.382]  This is, and again, they're just finding what cops and military will follow the orders and they're conditioning us to put up with anything and preparing to push us until a civil war breaks out.
[01:16:05.382 --> 01:16:06.023]  Well, that's just,
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.801]  That's all I have to say, Alex.
[01:16:08.801 --> 01:16:10.102]  God bless you, sir.
[01:16:10.102 --> 01:16:15.927]  Yeah, and again, I don't think people are cowards out there.
[01:16:15.927 --> 01:16:21.911]  If you hear what I talk about and then get scared, there's no hope for you.
[01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:27.335]  You should get concerned and then fight back politically very aggressively.
[01:16:27.335 --> 01:16:29.257]  And there's a thousand different things to do.
[01:16:29.257 --> 01:16:30.798]  This will not make it through.
[01:16:30.798 --> 01:16:31.618]  Hey, here's the good news.
[01:16:31.618 --> 01:16:32.319]  We warn people.
[01:16:34.415 --> 01:16:39.917]  Over a hundred million guns have been sold on record in the last five years.
[01:16:39.917 --> 01:16:41.657]  Over a hundred million.
[01:16:41.657 --> 01:16:43.918]  Billions of rounds of ammo have been purchased.
[01:16:43.918 --> 01:16:46.959]  Citizens are training everywhere.
[01:16:46.959 --> 01:16:49.660]  A lot of people in government are waking up and joining the awakening.
[01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:54.190]  So we're not going to be caught flat-footed in any of this.
[01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:55.750]  The Liberty Movement has done its job.
[01:16:55.750 --> 01:17:00.111]  We're intensifying operations, even though it's dangerous to my own person.
[01:17:00.111 --> 01:17:02.252]  I'm 110% committed.
[01:17:02.252 --> 01:17:10.273]  I am absolutely ramming the enemy at point-blank range, savaging them most viciously with the truth as I can, not holding anything back.
[01:17:10.273 --> 01:17:14.174]  I told you a year ago that I've been holding back, and I said I'm going to the next level.
[01:17:14.174 --> 01:17:17.735]  I'm committing to it 110%, and that's what we're trying to do here.
[01:17:20.506 --> 01:17:22.547]  Because only the truth will set us free.
[01:17:22.547 --> 01:17:25.650]  Only admitting how sick this is will set us free.
[01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:27.651]  Let's talk to Nick in New Jersey.
[01:17:27.651 --> 01:17:30.013]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:17:30.013 --> 01:17:32.174]  Hi Alex, quick question.
[01:17:32.174 --> 01:17:41.981]  With the rising cost of student loans and the diminishing job market in America, in your opinion, is it worth paying for a college education these days or is it a waste of money?
[01:17:43.021 --> 01:17:49.931]  No, except for a very few highest scoring people who then join the right fraternity.
[01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.453]  You have to do that on top of it.
[01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:54.523]  And who make all the right moves.
[01:17:54.523 --> 01:17:57.444]  College is completely, absolutely worthless now.
[01:17:57.444 --> 01:18:02.085]  Unless you're sending your daughter to a sorority to marry into another rich family.
[01:18:02.085 --> 01:18:09.127]  It is absolutely worthless unless it's squeezing the produce, you know, to see who you want to get married to.
[01:18:09.127 --> 01:18:13.107]  College is only good for social reasons.
[01:18:13.107 --> 01:18:18.068]  To continue elite or nouveau riche breeding.
[01:18:21.425 --> 01:18:29.830]  Even the wealthy are breaking down and your daughter will just rebel and run off and marry some criminal and get tattoos all over her face.
[01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.411]  It's absolutely worthless.
[01:18:31.411 --> 01:18:33.913]  And they admit it's a total fraud bubble.
[01:18:33.913 --> 01:18:35.154]  It was all designed that way.
[01:18:35.154 --> 01:18:36.674]  There will be no jobs.
[01:18:36.674 --> 01:18:44.479]  There will be no jobs allowed unless you go to college to work for Homeland Security and to get a Homeland Security grant or scholarship.
[01:18:44.479 --> 01:18:48.081]  And then even that, after they're done with the takedown, you won't get your pension.
[01:18:48.081 --> 01:18:49.242]  So no, it's completely worthless.
[01:18:51.283 --> 01:19:00.949]  Well, I'm already 27 years old, I have a job, I have a couple college degrees, but what would you recommend for students that are just leaving high school at this point?
[01:19:00.949 --> 01:19:06.813]  What's a good thing for them to do to get into at this point, just for the young people?
[01:19:06.813 --> 01:19:15.719]  I mean, if you just go to college for a semester as a guy to try to marry a rich girl, that's a reason to go to college.
[01:19:15.719 --> 01:19:18.001]  Women marrying rich guys, that's a reason to go.
[01:19:18.001 --> 01:19:20.823]  Like I said, if you can get in an elite fraternity,
[01:19:21.603 --> 01:19:23.065]  Because that's how those things work.
[01:19:23.065 --> 01:19:27.430]  Then you can, you know, get a job at an elite operation if you're smart.
[01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:31.134]  It's not enough to just have good grades.
[01:19:31.134 --> 01:19:31.554]  I don't know.
[01:19:31.554 --> 01:19:37.140]  The best job would probably be joining the police department and becoming a narcotics trafficker.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.242]  Or you could join Dine Corps and run children.
[01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:40.664]  I mean that's probably some of the only
[01:19:41.684 --> 01:19:43.086]  You can join Homeland Security.
[01:19:43.086 --> 01:19:53.019]  If you want to engage in criminal activity, kidnap children, ship narcotics, torture people worldwide, pull children's teeth out, rape them in front of their parents, DHS is hiring.
[01:19:53.019 --> 01:19:53.720]  So stay there.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.482]  I'll come back to you in just a minute.
[01:19:55.482 --> 01:19:55.823]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.711 --> 01:20:02.272]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[01:20:02.272 --> 01:20:08.378]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[01:20:08.378 --> 01:20:13.763]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E.M.
[01:20:13.763 --> 01:20:16.566]  Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[01:20:16.566 --> 01:20:22.231]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.
[01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:22.711]  The E.M.
[01:20:22.711 --> 01:20:24.453]  Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[01:20:24.733 --> 01:20:34.799]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.
[01:20:34.799 --> 01:20:39.862]  To learn more and order your Bokashi online, visit tarragonics.com and click on the orange button.

[01:20:45.045 --> 01:20:45.605]  Or call 866-369-3678.
[01:20:45.605 --> 01:20:45.805]  That's 866-369-3678.

[01:20:57.613 --> 01:20:58.573]  Terragonics.
[01:20:58.573 --> 01:20:59.274]  Life's getting better!
[01:21:00.512 --> 01:21:03.894]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:21:03.894 --> 01:21:09.898]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:13.760]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.341]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[01:21:15.341 --> 01:21:19.784]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[01:21:19.784 --> 01:21:21.825]  Go to GetSimpliSafe.com.
[01:21:22.478 --> 01:21:25.201]  SimpliSafe is independent and off the grid.
[01:21:25.201 --> 01:21:29.545]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[01:21:29.545 --> 01:21:36.172]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer, storage unit, or shed.
[01:21:36.172 --> 01:21:38.494]  Get SimpliSafe.com.
[01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:45.301]  SimpliSafe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes, so there's no need to let a stranger into your home.
[01:21:45.839 --> 01:21:49.906]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:56.898]  You aren't always at home, but SimpliSafe will stand guard, protecting your property 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:21:56.898 --> 01:21:59.061]  Again, that's GetSimpliSafe.com
[01:21:59.605 --> 01:22:08.907]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:08.907 --> 01:22:09.707]  This capitalism?
[01:22:09.707 --> 01:22:15.869]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:15.869 --> 01:22:19.570]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:19.570 --> 01:22:20.510]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:21.710]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:22.230]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:22.490]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:29.212 --> 01:22:33.455]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[01:22:33.455 --> 01:22:40.860]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored, and more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:44.963]  PRI Fuel Stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:22:44.963 --> 01:22:51.047]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at sea rely on PRI Fuel Stabilizers.
[01:22:51.047 --> 01:22:51.807]  And you can too!
[01:22:51.807 --> 01:22:53.568]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit priproducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[01:22:59.532 --> 01:23:07.557]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[01:23:07.557 --> 01:23:11.260]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:17.084]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[01:23:17.944 --> 01:23:29.155]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[01:23:29.155 --> 01:23:33.298]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[01:23:34.019 --> 01:23:42.703]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[01:23:42.703 --> 01:23:46.545]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[01:23:46.545 --> 01:23:48.986]  It's something much darker.
[01:23:48.986 --> 01:23:54.689]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[01:23:54.689 --> 01:23:56.010]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:25.833]  I agree with Thomas Jefferson, author of the First Amendment, who said that the government should be afraid of the people.
[01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:56.115]  But also, people like Rangel have got up this year and said, listen, forget your Second Amendment.
[01:24:56.115 --> 01:24:59.097]  Doesn't matter if it was designed to protect you from a bad government.
[01:24:59.097 --> 01:25:07.223]  We've got the drones, we've got the army, and there isn't anything you white people in the South, you crackerheads, are going to do.
[01:25:07.223 --> 01:25:09.265]  I mean, you can go find the clips.
[01:25:11.556 --> 01:25:13.256]  Again, making it racial.
[01:25:13.256 --> 01:25:20.719]  And it's only racist whites that want guns, and it's the Ku Klux Klan that wants guns, and the NRA is the new Ku Klux Klan.
[01:25:20.719 --> 01:25:22.719]  These are quotes, by the way.
[01:25:22.719 --> 01:25:23.699]  Compositive quotes.
[01:25:23.699 --> 01:25:27.720]  One of the quotes about the NRA is the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:30.201]  That was a Fox Sports writer.
[01:25:30.201 --> 01:25:36.723]  And again, they're invoking race through white people, black people, you name it, to try to get us fighting with each other.
[01:25:39.571 --> 01:25:44.715]  And this is the insaneness of all of it.
[01:25:44.715 --> 01:25:48.698]  This is the craziness of it all.
[01:25:48.698 --> 01:25:51.040]  That, ah ha ha, you're going to resist the government?
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:51.881]  No, you're not.
[01:25:51.881 --> 01:26:06.313]  You know, when I talk about DHS that hired the jail guards and certified them, private jail guards to go run Abu Ghraib under the army, where the army's own report said what I just said before the break, torturing children, including sexually,
[01:26:09.693 --> 01:26:11.814]  And then they did it at camps all over the world.
[01:26:11.814 --> 01:26:22.341]  And then I mentioned DynCorp and the Chicago Tribune and congressional hearings running giant sex trade operations, including children, with stuff I'm not even going to say on air.
[01:26:22.341 --> 01:26:24.122]  And no one got in trouble.
[01:26:24.122 --> 01:26:26.803]  Did you hear me yesterday?
[01:26:26.803 --> 01:26:29.125]  Last night, I happened to accidentally hit the free iPhone app.
[01:26:30.407 --> 01:26:39.592]  On my phone as I was getting in bed at about midnight and heard my show start playing, rebroadcasting off the earbuds by the bed stand.
[01:26:39.592 --> 01:26:41.413]  So I popped in and listened for about 10 minutes.
[01:26:41.413 --> 01:26:47.957]  And I was talking about here in Austin, I don't know, eight, nine years ago.
[01:26:47.957 --> 01:26:51.579]  I forget, my son was about two.
[01:26:51.579 --> 01:26:54.700]  This was about eight years ago.
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:55.841]  And I had him in for a checkup.
[01:26:58.366 --> 01:27:00.808]  And he goes, you know, I listen to your show.
[01:27:00.808 --> 01:27:02.709]  This is a big clinic.
[01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:04.530]  One of the biggest.
[01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:08.832]  Pediatricians, not even an anti-vaccine pediatrician, just one that won't harass you.
[01:27:08.832 --> 01:27:14.456]  They have on their website, you know, we, you know, do take patients that don't vaccinate.
[01:27:17.478 --> 01:27:24.443]  And he told me, no, they give people in Austin at the free clinics live, illegal SV40 virus.
[01:27:24.443 --> 01:27:25.504]  And he said, you know, that's illegal.
[01:27:25.504 --> 01:27:27.485]  That's been banned since 1962.
[01:27:27.485 --> 01:27:28.646]  And I said, I know.
[01:27:28.646 --> 01:27:29.387]  He goes, I know.
[01:27:29.387 --> 01:27:31.148]  But I said, well, you need to go public.
[01:27:31.148 --> 01:27:32.329]  He goes, no, no.
[01:27:32.329 --> 01:27:36.051]  And grabbed my arm and said, I just told you that off record, buddy.
[01:27:36.051 --> 01:27:40.214]  Just like doctor, patient privilege, journalist, source privilege.
[01:27:40.214 --> 01:27:40.715]  I go, I know.
[01:27:41.886 --> 01:27:45.467]  Because you can tell people a doctor told you, you go investigate it.
[01:27:45.467 --> 01:27:48.268]  And I called the health department and they said, oh, we'll get back with you.
[01:27:48.268 --> 01:27:52.409]  I mean, folks, these are sick people.
[01:27:52.409 --> 01:28:05.393]  Just like it was in the news yesterday, in the local TV station's headline, that they forcefully sterilized women in California prisons.
[01:28:05.393 --> 01:28:07.054]  Up until 2010.
[01:28:07.054 --> 01:28:09.794]  They always say up until two years ago.
[01:28:09.794 --> 01:28:11.475]  Folks, it's happening everywhere.
[01:28:13.936 --> 01:28:18.581]  They sterilize a lot of children that CPS grab.
[01:28:18.581 --> 01:28:22.285]  I remember having a CPS worker on who blew the whistle five years ago.
[01:28:22.285 --> 01:28:23.307]  It was in New York Daily News.
[01:28:23.307 --> 01:28:24.428]  I got her on.
[01:28:24.428 --> 01:28:29.333]  Could never get her back on again because of threats.
[01:28:29.333 --> 01:28:31.336]  And the woman was crying.
[01:28:33.689 --> 01:28:57.341]  Saying, I thought we were good, I thought we were good, but how they would go get the young black kids and take them, mainly black, because nobody stands up for black people, because their black leadership just wants to fight white people all day, nobody talks about the real stuff going on, and how they would take little black kids and chain them down, 6, 7, 8 year olds, and feed them pesticides until they died, in private facilities.
[01:28:57.341 --> 01:29:01.223]  Nobody's going to help them, nobody's coming to help them, nobody's coming to help anybody.
[01:29:02.096 --> 01:29:04.337]  Because America is a demonic cesspit.
[01:29:04.337 --> 01:29:06.678]  Nobody's gonna help the 53 million babies they already killed.
[01:29:06.678 --> 01:29:07.878]  Nobody's gonna help the millions more.
[01:29:07.878 --> 01:29:10.299]  They're just gonna dance around and say, Hell Satan, all day.
[01:29:10.299 --> 01:29:13.641]  Because it's fun to say, Hell Satan, isn't it?
[01:29:13.641 --> 01:29:14.661]  It's powerful.
[01:29:14.661 --> 01:29:20.023]  And nobody's gonna come help all of you running around saying, Hell Satan, either.
[01:29:20.023 --> 01:29:23.565]  Until we wake up and repent as a nation.
[01:29:23.565 --> 01:29:26.666]  But I was hearing what I was saying, and I'm like, man, this sounds so crazy.
[01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:28.547]  But then I knew it was all true.
[01:29:28.547 --> 01:29:30.428]  Just like I just talked about New York Daily News.
[01:29:31.846 --> 01:29:37.031]  Reports about him killing kids in pesticide tests and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:29:37.031 --> 01:29:38.692]  Nobody goes to jail.
[01:29:38.692 --> 01:29:45.218]  They just... You know, if a whistleblower exposes something, they just blow their car up or have the police raid their offices.
[01:29:45.218 --> 01:29:47.260]  That was in the news yesterday.
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:48.421]  Just unbelievable.
[01:29:48.421 --> 01:29:49.642]  Unbelievable.
[01:29:49.642 --> 01:29:51.024]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.024 --> 01:29:53.566]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:32:04.561 --> 01:32:07.422]  Coffee shops, airports, libraries.
[01:32:07.422 --> 01:32:11.664]  But, using public Wi-Fi means that people can spy on you.

[01:32:26.213 --> 01:32:27.114]  How?
[01:32:27.114 --> 01:32:35.321]  Well, it's kinda nerdy, but to put it simply, spies and companies that track you don't like us one bit.
[01:32:35.321 --> 01:32:39.405]  We create an encrypted tunnel so that nobody can spy on you.

[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:18.401]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.401 --> 01:33:21.783]  The jazz machine.
[01:33:21.783 --> 01:33:25.665]  Oh, it's growing real fast.
[01:33:38.735 --> 01:33:44.440]  That is Shooter Jennings bringing us in with Summer of Rage.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:48.643]  That's right, the gas mask is the couture in the Summer of Rage.
[01:33:48.643 --> 01:33:56.610]  They're building mass graves for the all-out police state.
[01:33:56.610 --> 01:33:59.872]  We're here six days a week, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:33:59.872 --> 01:34:02.895]  Eastern, back 7 o'clock weeknights.
[01:34:02.895 --> 01:34:05.857]  Hosting the news tonight is Paul Watson from England.
[01:34:05.857 --> 01:34:07.739]  I'll be doing the news portion
[01:34:08.803 --> 01:34:15.791]  With an exclusive in-depth interview with Adam Kokesh on how do we restore the republic or do we not restore the public?
[01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:18.034]  I disagree with him just saying get rid of the U.S.
[01:34:18.034 --> 01:34:19.015]  government completely.
[01:34:19.015 --> 01:34:20.016]  We don't have a U.S.
[01:34:20.016 --> 01:34:20.877]  government.
[01:34:20.877 --> 01:34:22.299]  I keep trying to explain that to him.
[01:34:22.299 --> 01:34:25.682]  So we're going to have kind of a lively debate tonight.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:33.662]  I don't know, Paul should be done with the news by about 7.30 and then I'll debate, begin a friendly debate with Kokesh.
[01:34:33.662 --> 01:34:39.264]  Please remember this broadcast is supported by patriots like you.
[01:34:39.264 --> 01:34:48.327]  So if you want to wake people up, there's nobody who's been more effective for whatever reason at getting people out of their trance than the Infowars operation.
[01:34:48.327 --> 01:34:52.208]  And yours truly, by the grace of God.
[01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:55.129]  So I believe we are the best outfit to spread the word about
[01:34:56.451 --> 01:35:06.135]  Everybody should get an InfoWars Nightly News membership to see all the films, to see the Nightly News, to see the high def archive of it each day, and the dozens and dozens of other documentaries that are posted there.
[01:35:06.135 --> 01:35:08.636]  Really, 17 years of material or more.
[01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:12.077]  The site's been up for more than 10 years, and it really works great now.
[01:35:12.077 --> 01:35:14.558]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:14.558 --> 01:35:16.479]  Please become a member today.
[01:35:16.479 --> 01:35:18.040]  If you are a member, please
[01:35:18.874 --> 01:35:27.502]  Make sure you have a unique username and passcode, that's something you can share, and up to 11 people can simultaneously log in with the same username and passcode.
[01:35:27.502 --> 01:35:29.904]  So I'd say, give it to 50 people.
[01:35:29.904 --> 01:35:32.766]  And if you ever try to log in and can't get on, good job!
[01:35:32.766 --> 01:35:35.188]  It means 11 people are watching!
[01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:39.172]  $5.95 a month, and then go get yourself another membership.
[01:35:39.172 --> 01:35:44.797]  And the little bit of money we make off that, we're able to fund this entire operation.
[01:35:46.172 --> 01:35:47.053]  And that's my goal.
[01:35:47.053 --> 01:35:47.974]  I have told my crew.
[01:35:47.974 --> 01:35:49.616]  And it's not bad to make money.
[01:35:49.616 --> 01:35:51.698]  It's good for liberty lovers to make money and be strong.
[01:35:51.698 --> 01:35:57.865]  But I mean, we are in the ultimate growth phase right now, spending 120% of what's coming in here.
[01:35:57.865 --> 01:35:59.086]  And I can't sustain that forever.
[01:36:00.058 --> 01:36:08.401]  But we're in some key developments right now to go to the next level with reporters, researchers, film editors, everything.
[01:36:08.401 --> 01:36:12.403]  The studio, the new studio, you're going to see all of it.
[01:36:12.403 --> 01:36:20.346]  We are 110% all-in in this fight, charging the New World Order, going up against their machine gun nest, and we need your support, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:20.346 --> 01:36:28.950]  When you buy the ProPure water filters, when you subscribe to the magazine, when you buy the new film that we are the exclusive people carrying that starts shipping in just five days,
[01:36:29.904 --> 01:36:32.746]  The premiere is next week on the Nightly News.
[01:36:32.746 --> 01:36:37.389]  The new documentary, State of Mind, on Blu-ray and DVD.
[01:36:37.389 --> 01:36:41.532]  It is all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:41.532 --> 01:36:45.055]  That's InfoWarsStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:36:45.055 --> 01:36:45.155]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:45.155 --> 01:36:49.217]  And as insane as this broadcast sounds, you can go to anybody you know out there.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:06.646]  And say, hey, let's listen to this guy's show and let's go look and see foster children had pesticides tested on them in New York.
[01:37:06.646 --> 01:37:11.468]  And you'll see a headline like, whistleblower says it might have been unethical.
[01:37:11.468 --> 01:37:13.229]  It's always like a whitewash.
[01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:17.492]  Yeah, this CPS worker says they would deliver kids here and some died.
[01:37:17.492 --> 01:37:19.493]  Kind of like the New York Times headline yesterday about
[01:37:22.148 --> 01:37:23.269]  Bayer Pharmaceuticals.
[01:37:23.269 --> 01:37:34.199]  I was talking about Bayer Pharmaceuticals for a decade, knowing that all their factor VIII product had HIV and hepatitis in it, was death sentence, and it was, oh, the more risky factor VIII was shipped overseas.
[01:37:35.213 --> 01:37:36.554]  You know, you go over to your neighbor and kill him.
[01:37:36.554 --> 01:37:39.877]  It's like, I want his risky at my house.
[01:37:39.877 --> 01:37:42.539]  I went over and killed the neighbor.
[01:37:42.539 --> 01:37:54.368]  It's the art of taking some incredible crime of, yeah, yeah, unknown agencies telling the LAPD not to release the Hastings situation report, police report.
[01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.609]  The firemen have been threatened.
[01:37:56.609 --> 01:37:57.810]  There's nothing going on.
[01:37:57.810 --> 01:37:59.872]  He said, hey, I'm running for my life.
[01:37:59.872 --> 01:38:01.613]  I'm being death-threatened, we now learn.
[01:38:01.613 --> 01:38:02.834]  I'm going underground.
[01:38:02.834 --> 01:38:04.275]  I got the biggest story ever.
[01:38:04.275 --> 01:38:04.856]  Boom!
[01:38:06.749 --> 01:38:07.269]  Boom!
[01:38:07.269 --> 01:38:11.191]  You're dead!
[01:38:11.191 --> 01:38:16.473]  And... I just don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:38:16.473 --> 01:38:17.814]  I mean, I shouldn't even be laughing.
[01:38:17.814 --> 01:38:18.634]  This is horrible.
[01:38:18.634 --> 01:38:20.095]  Except, I'm in this position.
[01:38:20.095 --> 01:38:22.296]  They could put a car bomb in my car today.
[01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:23.596]  Blow me sky high.
[01:38:23.596 --> 01:38:27.198]  Have the engine shoot, you know, 50-something yards down the street the other way.
[01:38:27.198 --> 01:38:29.479]  The car comes to rest up against a tree.
[01:38:29.479 --> 01:38:31.460]  It isn't even denting the car where it's at.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:34.601]  And they go... Everybody says, yeah, it was driving down the street and it just blew up.
[01:38:35.657 --> 01:38:38.008]  They're like, oh, no foul play.
[01:38:38.008 --> 01:38:38.932]  Police don't talk.
[01:38:38.932 --> 01:38:39.555]  Firemen don't talk.
[01:38:41.513 --> 01:38:44.794]  I mean, I could be on the radio and say, they death-threatened me!
[01:38:44.794 --> 01:38:49.014]  Please, I'm going into hiding, and then I'm dead hours later, and it's like, oh, there's nothing suspicious there.
[01:38:49.014 --> 01:38:58.716]  And joining us to talk about that, because he's going to go in-depth on this, tonight on the Nightly News is one of our best researchers and all-around broadcasters, you name it, with the team of 11 years.
[01:38:58.716 --> 01:39:01.017]  You can tell, folks, I really like the work he does.
[01:39:01.017 --> 01:39:02.517]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:39:02.517 --> 01:39:04.377]  Paul, this is really getting crazy.
[01:39:04.377 --> 01:39:06.478]  Your article, up on InfoWars.com.
[01:39:07.998 --> 01:39:11.641]  Police firefighters ordered not to speak about Meissel Hastings crash.
[01:39:11.641 --> 01:39:14.824]  LAPD refuses to release police report to journalists.
[01:39:14.824 --> 01:39:15.705]  I mean, why not?
[01:39:15.705 --> 01:39:17.166]  I mean, it's normal.
[01:39:17.166 --> 01:39:20.269]  Brand new Mercedes just blow up in the middle of the road.
[01:39:20.269 --> 01:39:28.235]  I mean, you know, I mean, hey, did you know the Ryder truck in Oklahoma City actually was speeding and ran into the building?
[01:39:28.235 --> 01:39:29.016]  Did you know that?
[01:39:29.016 --> 01:39:31.478]  Yeah, that was that wasn't even a car bomb either.
[01:39:31.478 --> 01:39:33.140]  Oklahoma City was not a car bomb, folks.
[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.941]  Kennedy was hit by a gnat.
[01:39:34.941 --> 01:39:35.522]  Paul Watson.
[01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:38.378]  Hi Alex, good to be back.
[01:39:38.378 --> 01:39:44.141]  Yeah, this is Kimberly Dvorak, who's a journalist out of San Diego Six News.
[01:39:44.141 --> 01:39:56.829]  Basically, she went to Los Angeles to speak with the LAPD, speak with the fire department involved in the response and investigation to the crash involving Rolling Stone journalist Michael Hastings last month.
[01:39:57.549 --> 01:40:06.572]  And was basically told, even though they ruled out foul play days after the incident, she was told, we're not going to give you the police report.
[01:40:06.572 --> 01:40:15.936]  And she was also told by firefighters and cops, they've been ordered not to speak to the media about the Michael Hastings crash.
[01:40:15.936 --> 01:40:18.557]  In addition... Well yeah, exactly.
[01:40:18.557 --> 01:40:23.619]  Or they'll be like the coroner who was over the Breitbart thing who got poisoned and died.
[01:40:24.748 --> 01:40:28.551]  Oh yeah, nothing to see here, move along.
[01:40:28.551 --> 01:40:52.748]  In addition, Mercedes have come out and said that this Inferno that consumed Hastings' car, which vehicle automotive experts have said is virtually impossible for a brand new Mercedes, Mercedes have also said that they don't know why that happened, that it shouldn't have happened, but the LAPD has refused to contact Mercedes to get any information on why that would happen.
[01:40:53.428 --> 01:40:53.889]  Unbelievable.
[01:41:12.625 --> 01:41:15.306]  I mean, you're talking about a big old, big old keg of C4 here.
[01:41:39.594 --> 01:41:48.439]  And also, there are no skid marks on the road, so if this was an accidental crash, you would expect there to have been at least some resistance to driving straight into that tree.
[01:41:48.439 --> 01:41:49.539]  No, they said it jackknifed.
[01:41:49.539 --> 01:41:51.680]  It just blew up into the air.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.341]  Exactly, so...
[01:41:53.257 --> 01:42:00.461]  You know, on top of that, you've got the two university studies which show it's very easy to hack and remote control a modern vehicle.
[01:42:00.461 --> 01:42:07.125]  You've got the former anti-terrorist Richard Clarke coming out and saying that that's a possibility, that's a plausible scenario.
[01:42:07.125 --> 01:42:08.706]  Yeah, I think he did that to distract off, though.
[01:42:08.706 --> 01:42:09.807]  I don't think it's remote control.
[01:42:09.807 --> 01:42:10.608]  It's good old-fashioned C4.
[01:42:12.867 --> 01:42:19.371]  Well, then we've got, you know, the motive, because we know Hastings exposed McChrystal back in 2010.
[01:42:19.371 --> 01:42:24.354]  He said he got death threats every single year from powerful people because of that.
[01:42:24.354 --> 01:42:30.698]  We know from his friend who was a guest on your show... Staff Sergeant Biggs said he was there when they said, we're going to kill you.
[01:42:31.684 --> 01:42:45.890]  Oh yeah, he routinely talks about that and in fact at a recent interview with CNN that they just aired excerpts of Hastings which was actually recorded a year ago but only just aired, he said that there was a ton of information he could have put in that book that he didn't.
[01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:52.752]  So that suggests he had even more dirt on people in high positions of power that he hadn't released in the public domain.
[01:42:52.752 --> 01:42:54.113]  So yeah, another motivation.
[01:42:55.133 --> 01:43:04.000]  He was contacting friends in the hours before his death, sending out emails saying he was going off the radar, he was paranoid, he was under investigation by the FBI.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:13.367]  His friend again, Joseph Bigg, said that he drove like a grandma, it would be very uncharacteristic for him to be driving at such high speed in the middle of the night.
[01:43:13.367 --> 01:43:18.150]  WikiLeaks reported that he contacted them, saying he was being investigated by the FBI.
[01:43:18.150 --> 01:43:23.795]  Of course, we know he had, quote, the biggest story yet on the CIA about to come out.
[01:43:24.495 --> 01:43:41.085]  All of this, all of the evidence surrounding the crash itself being suspicious and yet it was case closed within days, no foul play according to the LAPD who now refuses to release information and are telling cops and firefighters not to talk about it.
[01:43:41.505 --> 01:43:45.447]  Well, I texted Biggs this morning and he got back with me an hour ago.
[01:43:45.447 --> 01:43:46.828]  I hadn't checked my text.
[01:43:46.828 --> 01:43:48.069]  I'm going to call him during a break.
[01:43:48.069 --> 01:43:50.710]  He may pop in and overdrive the day or on the nightly news.
[01:43:50.710 --> 01:43:53.371]  But he says, yeah, this is really getting suspicious.
[01:43:53.371 --> 01:43:56.233]  He's trying to talk to the police right now.
[01:43:56.233 --> 01:43:58.294]  So we'll try to find out what happens with that.
[01:43:58.294 --> 01:44:02.316]  But the family and friends are all scared, he has said.
[01:44:05.245 --> 01:44:09.228]  So that's why he's had the courage to go public, because everybody else is scared.
[01:44:09.228 --> 01:44:12.990]  And folks, once a tyranny has everybody scared, it's won.
[01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:15.712]  Then you get the Nazi Germany, you get the Soviet Russia.
[01:44:15.712 --> 01:44:25.919]  Once they get to this point, where it's implicit that they're the ones doing this, which it basically now is, where they operate out in the open, then you either remove them, or they can do anything they want.
[01:44:26.679 --> 01:44:32.402]  So, we're now at that point of, are we going to be a totally broken, disgusting country?
[01:44:32.402 --> 01:44:38.105]  And it's time for police and military and people in the system to speak out more than ever.
[01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:42.527]  And that's why they're so scared of whistleblowers, though, is because that's the big chink in their armor.
[01:44:42.527 --> 01:44:49.851]  Paul Watson, you'll cover this more tonight, hosting InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central for PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers.
[01:44:49.851 --> 01:44:50.471]  Thank you so much.
[01:44:51.001 --> 01:44:52.162]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:44:52.162 --> 01:44:53.682]  All right, there goes Paul Watson.
[01:44:53.682 --> 01:45:02.966]  Now, I'm going to come back in the next segment, I promise, and go to Nick and Jim and Andrew and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[01:45:02.966 --> 01:45:08.469]  But I saw a story up on InfoWars.com.
[01:45:08.469 --> 01:45:13.751]  Sustainable Development Park violates Artist's First Amendment.
[01:45:13.751 --> 01:45:17.933]  And his great art that you can see up on the site was
[01:45:19.915 --> 01:45:46.398]  up there for a while and then they removed it because it was kind of tea party-esque showing people with American flags marching and stuff like that just serious thought criminal I mean stuff you would imagine in the old America really evil George Washington type stuff and so he contacted us so our writer Julie Wilson wrote a story about it we're putting some of his amazing art up on screen we have a link
[01:45:47.058 --> 01:45:55.745]  To his art site as well in the story, but joining us info wars.com One of the latest additions here one of our reporters.
[01:45:55.745 --> 01:46:06.173]  He's got local reporting for a few years on radio and in print is Julie Wilson Julie what's your take on this tell people about where this is what's happening and now reportedly?
[01:46:06.173 --> 01:46:07.253]  He's been blacklisted.
[01:46:07.253 --> 01:46:10.316]  They've sent an email around town saying you know this is a
[01:46:10.876 --> 01:46:21.750]  This is a person that, you know, that we're not to support basically, which is a good authoritarian instinct that we would expect to see in North Korea.
[01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:23.172]  Come on closer to your microphone for me.
[01:46:23.172 --> 01:46:23.412]  Thanks.
[01:46:23.412 --> 01:46:24.153]  Go ahead.
[01:46:24.153 --> 01:46:27.217]  Basically, this artist, Chris Obey...
[01:46:28.558 --> 01:46:28.958]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:46:58.978 --> 01:47:12.023]  But recently, he partnered up with a company called Atlantic Station, which seems like it's kind of like a Zilker Park for Austin place to have dining, movies in the park, concerts, festivals, that kind of thing.
[01:47:12.023 --> 01:47:16.885]  So he made a contract with them to be able to set up his art booth there.
[01:47:16.885 --> 01:47:19.185]  And he had one successful showing.
[01:47:19.185 --> 01:47:23.067]  He got good feedback from the customers and the leasing agents on the property.
[01:47:23.667 --> 01:47:26.508]  And so he went for his next monthly round to set up shop.
[01:47:26.508 --> 01:47:31.510]  He put $2,500 into his booth, you know, because he had a success last time.
[01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:40.694]  And this time, the GM came by his booth and started questioning his artwork and asked him, you know, what political party do you belong to?
[01:47:40.694 --> 01:47:42.934]  And what are your political viewpoints?
[01:47:42.934 --> 01:47:47.896]  He did stuff like a sign saying tax to death, showing Uncle Sam as a skeleton.
[01:47:47.896 --> 01:47:49.137]  I mean, how evil?
[01:47:49.137 --> 01:47:50.437]  How American?
[01:47:50.437 --> 01:47:50.937]  Right.
[01:47:50.937 --> 01:47:51.678]  This is Phil.
[01:47:51.678 --> 01:47:52.198]  This is evil.
[01:47:52.638 --> 01:47:57.620]  So, Chris Hobbe told them, listen, I'm not actually affiliated with any political party.
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:01.682]  I actually show our history through my work.
[01:48:01.682 --> 01:48:02.983]  And I don't consider it to be political.
[01:48:02.983 --> 01:48:04.924]  He shows veterans marching with American flags?
[01:48:04.924 --> 01:48:06.104]  Ooh.
[01:48:06.104 --> 01:48:07.165]  Ooh, that's bad.
[01:48:07.165 --> 01:48:13.147]  And so the GM actually left on the note with complimenting him on his work and then took off in his golf cart.
[01:48:13.147 --> 01:48:17.649]  And the next thing he knew, the leasing agents came by and told him that he had to shut down shop immediately.
[01:48:17.649 --> 01:48:20.611]  And that if he didn't, they were going to escort him off the property.
[01:48:21.451 --> 01:48:28.973]  And so while he was taking out his work, a local newspaper called Creative Loathing, Loathing, excuse me, was photographing his work and said, hey, you know, what are you doing?
[01:48:28.973 --> 01:48:30.033]  Where are you going?
[01:48:30.033 --> 01:48:32.134]  And he said, well, you know, I've been asked to leave.
[01:48:32.134 --> 01:48:48.799]  And so he left the premises and a short time later he got a phone call from that same newspaper telling him that a mass email was circulating around to all the businesses in Atlantic City, or I'm sorry, Atlantic Station, saying that his work was actually, I can give you the quote right here, they told him,
[01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:53.726]  That his work was... This was in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:48:55.701 --> 01:49:05.067]  And there's nothing violent, because he sent us the stuff that was there.
[01:49:05.067 --> 01:49:09.730]  I mean, they just take everything and demonize it and say, oh, you're criticizing the government.
[01:49:09.730 --> 01:49:11.011]  That might cause violence.
[01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:14.053]  That's what all these newspaper reporters always ask me.
[01:49:14.053 --> 01:49:18.256]  And then Bloomberg had the quote in there, Alex Jones doesn't build bombs.
[01:49:18.256 --> 01:49:19.717]  He builds bombers.
[01:49:19.717 --> 01:49:23.060]  Yeah, that was... Really, I thought the defense contractors built bombers.
[01:49:24.011 --> 01:49:26.012]  I thought the FBI built bombers.
[01:49:26.012 --> 01:49:39.021]  Another point that I really want to make about this story is that the park that shut this guy down, when you go to their website, they actually advertise themselves as the National Model for Smart Growth and Sustainable Development.
[01:49:39.801 --> 01:49:43.404]  And their motto is live, work, and play in the same community.
[01:49:43.404 --> 01:49:45.526]  Well, let me tell you what you do to this UN group.
[01:49:45.526 --> 01:49:55.696]  He goes and videotapes other art, anything that has a skeleton, because the most offensive thing could be Uncle Sam as a skeleton, and say, you know, how is that violent?
[01:49:55.696 --> 01:50:00.180]  And then show any other type of art like that, then you have a discrimination issue.
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:04.845]  And you've got to block these authoritarians, because they will shut everybody down.
[01:50:05.785 --> 01:50:14.011]  Yeah, he said that the booth next to him had art that had nudity and all that kind of stuff, which was supposed to be banned from the festival, but nothing was said to them.
[01:50:14.011 --> 01:50:18.835]  Well, the point is, you come, they accept you to the festival, then they kick you out.
[01:50:18.835 --> 01:50:21.337]  This is how real authoritarianism operates.
[01:50:21.337 --> 01:50:22.318]  First thing Hitler did.
[01:50:23.406 --> 01:50:27.830]  with gypsies, jews, and other gribs was not let them be in festivals.
[01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:29.571]  Then, they couldn't have their own business.
[01:50:29.571 --> 01:50:31.292]  You know, they'd go knock the windows out.
[01:50:31.292 --> 01:50:34.255]  And then, oh, you gotta go to this ghetto for your safety.
[01:50:34.255 --> 01:50:36.757]  And then, oh, we're gonna put you on these trains for your safety.
[01:50:36.757 --> 01:50:37.377]  That's how it works.
[01:50:37.377 --> 01:50:43.022]  People can read the full article and see the evil thought crime at PrisonBlinded.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:50:43.022 --> 01:50:46.524]  Sustainable Development Park violates artists' First Amendment rights.
[01:50:46.524 --> 01:50:50.788]  Good job for standing up for that wicked First Amendment, Julie.

[01:53:00.146 --> 01:53:03.629]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[01:53:03.629 --> 01:53:06.691]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[01:53:06.691 --> 01:53:09.513]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[01:53:09.513 --> 01:53:12.955]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[01:53:12.955 --> 01:53:19.200]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.522]  Wonder if there will really be a problem?

[01:54:11.883 --> 01:54:23.786]  Yeah, former governor of New Jersey, former head of Goldman Sachs can take two million dollars out of people's private accounts and have a bunch of it disappear and he doesn't get in trouble two years later.
[01:54:23.786 --> 01:54:36.030]  But if you want to go pay your money and be part of an art show outside Atlanta that says take care of veterans and stuff and shows veterans with American flags, boy that's evil.
[01:54:36.030 --> 01:54:36.670]  You're not allowed to
[01:54:37.625 --> 01:54:43.827]  Not allowed to have it, and they also sent out a mass email saying we need it, you know, because this is what the UN groups do.
[01:54:43.827 --> 01:54:51.589]  Once they get a foothold, hey, don't do any business, reportedly, is what they're reporting, with these people.
[01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:54.829]  These are thought criminals.
[01:54:54.829 --> 01:55:01.051]  And then meanwhile, the sheriff's cold case posse out in Arizona,
[01:55:02.389 --> 01:55:06.493]  In Phoenix, forensics findings on Obama's birth certificate.
[01:55:06.493 --> 01:55:09.175]  A 100% forgery, no doubt about it.
[01:55:09.175 --> 01:55:12.699]  Well, this is coming from a bunch of detectives.
[01:55:12.699 --> 01:55:14.100]  I don't need to have detectives.
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:18.524]  I told you hours after it was released a few years ago it was fake.
[01:55:18.524 --> 01:55:20.205]  Let me explain this to you.
[01:55:20.205 --> 01:55:28.053]  They have word processors, it was Microsoft Words what they used and part of it, that looks like typewriter.
[01:55:29.138 --> 01:55:30.959]  Yeah, the World Tribune's reporting that right now.
[01:55:30.959 --> 01:55:36.944]  That looks like a typewriter, but a typewriter really splats the ribbon.
[01:55:36.944 --> 01:55:42.869]  Really splats the ribbon, so each one is different like a raindrop or a ice crystal or a snowflake.
[01:55:42.869 --> 01:55:45.211]  A fingerprint.
[01:55:45.211 --> 01:55:52.297]  These are meant to look like a typewriter, but it's the typewriter font from a computer.
[01:55:52.297 --> 01:55:55.780]  So the splats on the T's and the C's and everything
[01:55:56.823 --> 01:56:00.984]  You have multiple C's, multiple T's, multiple A's, multiple I's.
[01:56:00.984 --> 01:56:03.025]  They're identical!
[01:56:03.025 --> 01:56:05.506]  They're identical!
[01:56:05.506 --> 01:56:08.107]  It's totally fake!
[01:56:08.107 --> 01:56:08.987]  100%!
[01:56:08.987 --> 01:56:09.948]  Done!
[01:56:09.948 --> 01:56:14.729]  But they go through over 50 other things.
[01:56:14.729 --> 01:56:16.110]  And this is a psyop, folks.
[01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:17.710]  They did it on purpose.
[01:56:17.710 --> 01:56:19.111]  As a big joke.
[01:56:19.111 --> 01:56:20.471]  Because it's all about throwing our face.
[01:56:20.471 --> 01:56:22.772]  It's like blowing Michael Hastings' car up in front of everybody.
[01:56:24.378 --> 01:56:26.520]  It's all just, yeah, okay, it's totally fake.
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.422]  And it turns out he isn't really from Kenya.
[01:56:28.422 --> 01:56:29.583]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[01:56:29.583 --> 01:56:33.386]  His dad is a famous communist pornographer.
[01:56:33.386 --> 01:56:34.447]  Dreams of my real father.
[01:56:34.447 --> 01:56:35.508]  We sell the film.
[01:56:35.508 --> 01:56:37.190]  InfoWars4.com.
[01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:38.951]  Open and shut.
[01:56:38.951 --> 01:56:45.177]  Regardless, he used to spend summers with the famous communist pornographer in Hawaii.
[01:56:45.177 --> 01:56:45.858]  And it's his dad!
[01:56:49.090 --> 01:56:54.655]  There's photos of Obama with him on the... Oh, I can't even believe it.
[01:56:54.655 --> 01:56:58.057]  Reality is so whacked out.
[01:56:58.057 --> 01:57:06.684]  Reality is so whacked out that I don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:57:06.684 --> 01:57:14.310]  By the way, the State Department came out a few years ago and had to admit, yeah, his dad really wasn't his dad.
[01:57:15.148 --> 01:57:17.149]  You know, the Kenyan professor?
[01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:18.370]  He got kicked out of the U.S.
[01:57:18.370 --> 01:57:25.395]  because the State Department found it was a sham marriage and that he was not the father.
[01:57:25.395 --> 01:57:29.358]  So the whole Kenya thing, that's why his wife says he's from Kenya and all those speeches.
[01:57:29.358 --> 01:57:30.979]  They're like, hey, she says he's from Kenya.
[01:57:30.979 --> 01:57:32.580]  Why are you saying we're crazy?
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:38.764]  Hey, why does this Harvard, the head of the Harvard Law School say from Kenya?
[01:57:38.764 --> 01:57:41.546]  All his publications from Kenya until six years ago.
[01:57:42.608 --> 01:57:45.169]  Why are you saying it was all a setup?
[01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:48.891]  Kenya was the cover.
[01:57:48.891 --> 01:57:51.612]  So of course he's got a fake birth certificate.
[01:57:51.612 --> 01:57:57.154]  The guy's got at least three admitted aliases.
[01:57:57.154 --> 01:58:02.937]  Barack Obama, Barry Sotero, Barry Obama, well there's one other.
[01:58:04.605 --> 01:58:06.286]  That's why all the records are sealed.
[01:58:06.286 --> 01:58:07.887]  This country is in total trouble.
[01:58:07.887 --> 01:58:15.572]  I mean, I just cannot believe what we have gotten to, what we put up with, and it's only going to get more bizarro.
[01:58:15.572 --> 01:58:16.273]  Okay, I'm going to break.
[01:58:16.273 --> 01:58:25.939]  I'm going to come back and go to Nick, and then Andrew, and then Lazarus, and Jim, and Michael, and then coming up in studio, Nomi Prince.
[01:58:25.939 --> 01:58:26.760]  We've thrown her in.
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:27.961]  We appreciate her coming.
[01:58:27.961 --> 01:58:32.484]  Former managing director at Goldman Sachs, a big whistleblower and best-selling author.
[01:58:33.658 --> 01:58:40.929]  She's gonna start at the beginning and tell us where we're going straight ahead.

[02:00:27.626 --> 02:00:32.369]  Alright, let's go right back to your phone calls and Nomi Prins is going to be joining us in studio.
[02:00:32.369 --> 02:00:34.671]  Whistleblower par excellence.
[02:00:34.671 --> 02:00:37.733]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in New Jersey.
[02:00:37.733 --> 02:00:38.693]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:38.693 --> 02:00:42.216]  Then we'll go to Andrew and others.
[02:00:42.216 --> 02:00:42.656]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:43.615 --> 02:00:51.382]  You know, I think a big thing that we need to try to instill in our young people and old people of all ages is pride.
[02:00:51.382 --> 02:00:54.565]  America has lost that sense of pride that we once had.
[02:00:54.565 --> 02:01:02.673]  You know, whether you're sweeping floors and cleaning toilets or you're building spaceships, we just lost that sense of pride in our work.
[02:01:02.673 --> 02:01:05.695]  No matter what you do, do it the best you can.
[02:01:05.695 --> 02:01:08.158]  If we can get some of that back in this country,
[02:01:08.878 --> 02:01:12.380]  I think it'll go a long way just to take pride in our country.
[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:14.241]  Oh yeah, people don't have pride in themselves.
[02:01:14.241 --> 02:01:19.303]  I mean, imagine if you tried to pull a cop over and search their car without a warrant, they would arrest you.
[02:01:19.303 --> 02:01:27.807]  Or if you tried to say, by the way, officer, I want to stick my hand, not even in your pants, but in your body, they would laugh at you.
[02:01:27.807 --> 02:01:33.510]  But it's like for us now, they're like, no, we're going to not just violate your Fourth Amendment, we're going to violate your body.
[02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:34.391]  We're going to rape you.
[02:01:35.373 --> 02:01:38.395]  I mean, how did we get there?
[02:01:38.395 --> 02:01:42.839]  North Korea doesn't even randomly pull you over and do that to you.
[02:01:42.839 --> 02:01:44.500]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:45.101]  It's incredible.
[02:01:45.101 --> 02:01:50.705]  America is like in a hallucination trance of tyranny.
[02:01:50.705 --> 02:01:52.026]  I wonder how bad it's going to get.
[02:01:53.582 --> 02:01:55.523]  That's it, but culture is just lost.
[02:01:55.523 --> 02:02:04.908]  We have no culture, no pride, nobody really just cares about anything except Hollywood and you know what Angelina Jolie is doing this week.
[02:02:04.908 --> 02:02:06.329]  Unbelievable, good to hear from you.
[02:02:06.329 --> 02:02:08.430]  Go ahead, a last comment?
[02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:10.151]  No, no, thank you Alex, I won't take up any more of your time.
[02:02:10.151 --> 02:02:11.032]  No, Nick, you're awesome.
[02:02:11.032 --> 02:02:12.913]  Thank you for calling and bringing up those points.
[02:02:12.913 --> 02:02:14.794]  Andrew in Indiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:16.775]  Alex, how you doing buddy?
[02:02:16.775 --> 02:02:17.616]  God bless you.
[02:02:17.616 --> 02:02:18.236]  I'm doing alright.
[02:02:19.366 --> 02:02:25.709]  Hey, I used to be one of those people that didn't think there was anything I could do about what was going on, but I got fed up of thinking that way.
[02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:34.012]  So I went to my local store and I got some poster board and just started writing some Martin Luther King sayings on there and some things that I had
[02:02:35.785 --> 02:02:36.485]  We're good to go.
[02:02:56.846 --> 02:03:02.991]  I mean, I can start a radio program for probably nothing, you know?
[02:03:02.991 --> 02:03:04.512]  No, that's the thing.
[02:03:04.512 --> 02:03:05.532]  People always come to me.
[02:03:05.532 --> 02:03:11.817]  I went and spoke at an event this Saturday that I've been asked to be the surprise guest at, and everybody ran up.
[02:03:11.817 --> 02:03:14.299]  Well, some people ran up and said, oh, Alex, do this, do that.
[02:03:14.299 --> 02:03:14.839]  Can you do this?
[02:03:14.839 --> 02:03:17.761]  And I looked at them, and I said, you need to do it.
[02:03:17.761 --> 02:03:18.702]  You need to do it.
[02:03:18.702 --> 02:03:20.664]  You need to take action.
[02:03:20.664 --> 02:03:24.967]  And everybody just needs to do a little something against the tyrants, and they will fall.
[02:03:27.281 --> 02:03:32.384]  We gotta wake America up, or America's gonna be lost.
[02:03:32.384 --> 02:03:33.465]  Yes sir.
[02:03:33.465 --> 02:03:33.565]  Alex.
[02:03:33.565 --> 02:03:33.845]  Hey buddy.
[02:03:33.845 --> 02:03:33.905]  Hey.
[02:03:57.836 --> 02:04:03.760]  We all know that there's a lot of problems in America, but nobody seems to know what to do about it.
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:10.865]  I think we need to start organizing like the Marxists have done for the last 40 or 50 years.
[02:04:10.865 --> 02:04:13.747]  The 4th of July is a historic day.
[02:04:13.747 --> 02:04:16.789]  We have a year between now and the next one.
[02:04:16.789 --> 02:04:21.913]  I believe we need to organize a 4th of July event that teaches people
[02:04:22.614 --> 02:04:24.476]  That sounds pretty terrorist.
[02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:47.337]  Through every state of the union, through every county.
[02:04:47.337 --> 02:04:47.757]  I hear you.
[02:04:47.757 --> 02:04:49.118]  Who's going to organize that, man?
[02:04:49.118 --> 02:04:50.659]  Because that's a tall order.
[02:04:50.659 --> 02:04:55.361]  You can do something simple like, let's march on all the capitals to expose the New World Order.
[02:04:55.361 --> 02:04:56.681]  You know, things like that.
[02:04:56.681 --> 02:04:58.322]  But when you start trying to have meetings and stuff...
[02:05:00.646 --> 02:05:04.508]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:05:04.508 --> 02:05:10.031]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:05:10.031 --> 02:05:17.755]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:05:17.755 --> 02:05:26.880]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:34.247]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:05:34.247 --> 02:05:37.130]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:05:37.130 --> 02:05:44.037]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:48.006]  State of Mind.
[02:05:48.006 --> 02:05:50.608]  Because there's a war on for your mind.

[02:08:18.027 --> 02:08:21.589]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:37.318]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:37.318 --> 02:08:41.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live now into the third hour.
[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:44.662]  Nomi Prins is going to be our guest.
[02:08:45.712 --> 02:08:48.373]  And Nomi Prins is an independent journalist and author and speaker.
[02:08:48.373 --> 02:08:59.816]  And I'm not going to go through all of her different degrees and background, but she was a managing director at Goldman Sachs over some key areas that she thought was going to cause a major problem and basically quit over it.
[02:08:59.816 --> 02:09:01.877]  And I guess you could call it really a whistleblower.
[02:09:01.877 --> 02:09:03.337]  She's written a bunch of best-selling books.
[02:09:03.337 --> 02:09:06.038]  She's got a new book coming out very, very soon as well.
[02:09:06.038 --> 02:09:07.219]  We'll talk to her about that.
[02:09:07.219 --> 02:09:09.219]  NomiPrins.com.
[02:09:09.219 --> 02:09:11.140]  We have links to that up on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:19.105]  Obviously, I want to get into the announcement that there'll be no criminal charges two years later on Don Corzine of MF Global.
[02:09:19.105 --> 02:09:22.107]  I want to get into the bond market, all your inside take on that.
[02:09:22.107 --> 02:09:28.172]  But for new listeners out there, we have a lot of new stations and new folks tuning in every millisecond.
[02:09:28.172 --> 02:09:37.158]  Tell people a little bit about yourself, your awakening, what you've witnessed and what this general system is and why you decided to get out of it, was it a decade ago?
[02:09:37.498 --> 02:09:39.639]  Yeah, over a decade now.
[02:09:39.639 --> 02:09:43.742]  Yeah, I had been in international banking for over a decade actually.
[02:09:43.742 --> 02:09:52.668]  I had been at Lehman Brothers, I had been at Bear Stearns in London for seven years, and then my final stop was Goldman Sachs where I was only for less than two years and just had to get out because it was just such a
[02:09:53.588 --> 02:10:15.555]  A horrible environment around the time when Enron was imploding and WorldCom was imploding and this whole idea which later imploded the rest of the economy of credit derivatives and CDOs and all these esoteric things that had to do with horrible loans, bonds that were going to default, companies that were going to default were really coming to the head of the company and Wall Street in general.
[02:10:16.301 --> 02:10:19.724]  And I read your book that came out, what, in 2006 or so?
[02:10:19.724 --> 02:10:19.744]  2004.
[02:10:19.744 --> 02:10:24.708]  2004, I guess I read 2006, where you explained what was going to happen before it happened.
[02:10:24.708 --> 02:10:26.749]  You said, I wasn't going to be involved in this criminality.
[02:10:26.749 --> 02:10:27.430]  Well, no, exactly.
[02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:39.819]  We were literally sitting there in offices looking at tons of loans that were going to implode, derivatives that were going to implode, and being asked to sort of find a way to make money out of that for Goldman and for the companies, or Zenron and WorldCom, whatever those companies were.
[02:10:39.819 --> 02:10:41.861]  And I found that incredibly untenable.
[02:10:41.861 --> 02:10:43.542]  It went through insurance companies, it went through all sorts of people.
[02:10:43.542 --> 02:10:45.884]  So you weren't going to sell it to pensioners and people?
[02:10:46.464 --> 02:10:56.089]  I had come to Goldman basically from a position where I believed, even in all the years I was in banking, that it was important to show people what the downside could be of certain types of speculation.
[02:10:56.089 --> 02:10:58.891]  And that was not something that Goldman really wanted to show.
[02:10:58.891 --> 02:11:07.715]  And I had a lot of problems internally trying to be able to show analytics and develop things and get funding to show clients and investors in general what could go wrong.
[02:11:07.715 --> 02:11:10.416]  Because I thought, if you have knowledge, you can make a decision.
[02:11:10.416 --> 02:11:13.218]  If you don't, you're in a black hole, and a fraudulent black hole.
[02:11:14.171 --> 02:11:22.796]  But then the opposite of you is some of the traders and people at Goldman and the Timberwolves stuff about this is total crud, let's sell it to our customers.
[02:11:22.796 --> 02:11:39.825]  Well that's what exactly happened was I left and in the next few years that followed when I left which was in early 2002 and I wrote a book in 2004, it came out in 2004, I wrote in 2003 about how all of this was going to implode and how these wars between the banks and these trading desks and were really being fought over people's loans.
[02:11:40.445 --> 02:11:41.526]  And that's what happened.
[02:11:41.526 --> 02:11:53.631]  The subprime loans, all the regular loans in the country became fodder for these CDO deals like Timberwolf, like Abacus, like all the different names that were thrown at them that then imploded into the general economy a few years later.
[02:11:53.631 --> 02:11:59.493]  But at the time, the whole idea was to move, move, move this stuff off the trading books into the world.
[02:11:59.913 --> 02:12:05.915]  And that's what happened, and over the next few years, from when I left until basically the beginning of 2007, that's what was happening.
[02:12:05.915 --> 02:12:18.220]  This stuff was proliferating the world, pension funds, small towns in Norway, small towns in Holland, small towns in California, and really creating this crumbling decay of an economy.
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:25.203]  And I saw that from the outside, I wasn't inside at that point, and that's when I started writing more and more about that, and I continue to write about that because it's
[02:12:25.864 --> 02:12:30.035]  It's a dangerous situation that people need to be aware of and need to have knowledge about.
[02:12:30.035 --> 02:12:32.983]  Not just the implosion that already happened that we think was over in 2008.
[02:12:32.983 --> 02:12:33.323]  It's not over.
[02:12:34.892 --> 02:12:36.113]  Well that was my next question.
[02:12:36.113 --> 02:12:39.254]  I've seen the charts that there's more derivatives now than before.
[02:12:39.254 --> 02:12:45.998]  They're taking the so-called bailout money, too big to fail, and re-leveraging it when they know it's impossible to ever pump it up.
[02:12:45.998 --> 02:12:57.644]  I believe, and I've seen a lot of evidence to show, it's conscious to get everything infected with it so they can then hold everybody hostage saying, do whatever we say in the future, on any issue, or everything will implode.
[02:12:58.544 --> 02:13:00.246]  And then they become rulers of the world.
[02:13:00.246 --> 02:13:02.829]  It's a Ponzi scheme that's too big to fail.
[02:13:02.829 --> 02:13:06.633]  And so the whole world falls to it, instead of them all going to jail.
[02:13:06.633 --> 02:13:08.796]  I mean, do you agree with what Bernie Madoff said?
[02:13:08.796 --> 02:13:11.118]  I mean, I think I do, and other economists I've talked to have.
[02:13:11.118 --> 02:13:14.062]  That when he said, look, I'm just doing what everybody else did.
[02:13:14.062 --> 02:13:15.824]  And if so, why did he get in trouble then?
[02:13:16.394 --> 02:13:22.179]  He got in trouble because he didn't have as many political connections as some of these bigger guys who did not get in trouble.
[02:13:22.179 --> 02:13:24.181]  Yes, he created a Ponzi scheme.
[02:13:24.181 --> 02:13:26.083]  Yes, he lost a lot of people a lot of money.
[02:13:26.083 --> 02:13:26.744]  Yes, he lied.
[02:13:26.744 --> 02:13:28.425]  Yes, he kept it going for years.
[02:13:28.425 --> 02:13:36.272]  And yes, the SEC was told about it by various whistleblowers throughout the years and decided to ignore it completely until it was too big to ignore.
[02:13:36.272 --> 02:13:41.137]  But he was too little a guy, as big as he was, to save himself.
[02:13:42.537 --> 02:13:43.518]  That's right.
[02:13:43.518 --> 02:14:06.612]  Unlike John Corzine and Jamie Dimond and Lloyd Blank and all these other guys who are basically at the top of either large implosions that have been obvious or smaller types of deceptions that have gone on for years, they are more politically connected to the administration, to the various, you know, the DOJ, the SEC and all the organizations in Washington that refuse to really
[02:14:07.572 --> 02:14:17.616]  Fight, jail, indict, convict any of the people that are really creating a larger global type of crimes against populations.
[02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:17.816]  Wow.
[02:14:21.072 --> 02:14:42.463]  You've gotten some praise for what you've done, but somebody like yourself, or somebody like Amber Lyon, who had won all these Emmys at CNN, and was doing a great job, and then she found out the West just two years ago, or a year ago, was actually covering up and funding mass murders of men, women, and children at demonstrations in places.
[02:14:43.323 --> 02:14:51.967]  uh... in the Middle East and then she found out her show had been bought out basically five hundred thousand dollars behind the scenes per episode just to shut her down.
[02:14:51.967 --> 02:14:59.091]  Not only was CNN killing the story, they were demanding payouts from the governments of Bahrain and others to cover it up.
[02:14:59.091 --> 02:15:01.432]  And she left, you know, a well-paying job.
[02:15:01.432 --> 02:15:02.132]  She's famous.
[02:15:02.132 --> 02:15:05.454]  She's, you know, everywhere to stop that.
[02:15:05.454 --> 02:15:06.514]  You did the same thing.
[02:15:06.514 --> 02:15:09.956]  A managing director at Goldman Sachs over some key areas.
[02:15:09.956 --> 02:15:11.397]  Describe what you were over.
[02:15:12.357 --> 02:15:14.419]  And of course, I would do the same thing.
[02:15:14.419 --> 02:15:19.343]  I have refused to sell out to big media and things, just because there's no future if you don't.
[02:15:19.343 --> 02:15:22.485]  But why is that so rare nowadays?
[02:15:22.485 --> 02:15:25.548]  Or is it just we don't know about all the people that did the right thing?
[02:15:26.771 --> 02:15:27.752]  I think there's a little bit of both.
[02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:31.776]  I think there's a lot of people who choose to leave those types of positions and just not become public.
[02:15:31.776 --> 02:15:33.637]  You know, just go and do something else.
[02:15:33.637 --> 02:15:37.461]  I have friends who used to work at Goldman who are, you know, helping orphans in Nicaragua.
[02:15:37.461 --> 02:15:37.961]  You know what I mean?
[02:15:37.961 --> 02:15:43.126]  There's certain people that just don't get out there publicly and talk about it, and there's some people that do.
[02:15:43.126 --> 02:15:44.087]  And I think it's really hard.
[02:15:44.087 --> 02:15:48.070]  People get complacent, or they need the money, or whatever it might be, or they...
[02:15:49.431 --> 02:16:02.037]  They consider what they're doing not so bad, they're making a living, they're making a big living, they're making a ton of money, whatever it might be, and they don't tend to take a look at themselves, at the situation, at the overall impact of it, and they stay in these positions, or they leave.
[02:16:02.037 --> 02:16:02.918]  And it's really hard.
[02:16:02.918 --> 02:16:11.162]  When I first came out with my book, my first book, Other People's Money, I was in London, and there was a reporter that was asked at the London Times Magazine whether I had worked there.
[02:16:11.862 --> 02:16:20.490]  And this question, apparently, I found out later, went back to Hank Paulson in New York, and I don't know what happened in between him and the London office, but the London office denied I had even worked there for a second.
[02:16:20.490 --> 02:16:25.013]  And then, of course, they couldn't, because the news came out and the reporter called me and said, you worked here, right?
[02:16:25.013 --> 02:16:26.815]  I'm like, yes, I worked there.
[02:16:26.815 --> 02:16:28.677]  Of course I did.
[02:16:28.677 --> 02:16:39.225]  But there's a lot of difficulties along the way in trying to talk about some very powerful institutions, powerful individuals, and also a lot of esoteric financial stuff.
[02:16:40.286 --> 02:16:42.367]  That's not always easy to explain to people.
[02:16:42.367 --> 02:16:44.028]  It's a bunch of hocus-pocus.
[02:16:44.028 --> 02:17:07.578]  Yes, it's taking stuff, financial loans, whatever they may be, and repackaging them to make them look better, and throwing them on to someone else until the game is over, and the banks that created this stuff are fine, or they're bailed out, or they get to tax deduct losses and have all sorts of manners to protect themselves, whereas externally there aren't those same kinds of protections.
[02:17:08.298 --> 02:17:18.988]  And it's the same thing if you're inside of a system and you're trying to talk about it, whether you call it whistleblowing or explaining or creating knowledge or whatever you call it, it's very hard to go against that sometimes.
[02:17:18.988 --> 02:17:22.612]  And you have to be independent, I think, in order to do it a lot of the times.
[02:17:22.612 --> 02:17:27.936]  You have to decide, I'm not going to be part of that establishment, I'm not even going to necessarily... Sure.
[02:17:27.936 --> 02:17:29.698]  Yeah, I don't believe it and I'm not going to be part of it.
[02:17:29.698 --> 02:17:31.019]  You know, they call it buffers.
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:51.607]  Or they call it plausible deniability, but what I've seen the UN and Goldman Sachs and all these globalists are really good at is they have committees and they call things that are one thing another thing and then they all act like they have plausible deniability to not know so no one ever gets left with a hand grenade they're passing around the table
[02:17:52.287 --> 02:18:00.013]  But then, once they can't get in trouble, it creates this risk, this moral hazard they've talked about, where now they can get away with anything!
[02:18:00.013 --> 02:18:18.306]  Because it's all set up with a bunch of Sergeant Schultz saying, I know nothing, when they know full well what they're doing, and then you look at it, it's going to bring down the society, and they're gearing up the FEMA camps and the armed troops all over the world, and British Ministry of Defense reports admitting, this is going to end civilization as we know it.
[02:18:19.648 --> 02:18:21.711]  Because we'll never triage the debt.
[02:18:21.711 --> 02:18:23.334]  We'll never arrest these people.
[02:18:23.334 --> 02:18:27.080]  It's like you either cut them out, or we all are destroyed.
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:28.783]  And the answer is, you'll be destroyed.
[02:18:28.783 --> 02:18:30.766]  Is there any way out of the madness?
[02:18:31.215 --> 02:18:33.276]  The thing is, these people are the system.
[02:18:33.276 --> 02:18:34.917]  And they've been the system.
[02:18:34.917 --> 02:18:41.542]  If you're running a major bank, if you're Jamie Dimond, or you're President Obama, you're linked.
[02:18:41.542 --> 02:18:42.482]  You have an alliance.
[02:18:42.482 --> 02:18:44.784]  You can't let the other person fail.
[02:18:44.784 --> 02:18:57.772]  So if you're Obama and you're going in to rise from State Senate to Senate to the President, you're Jamie Dimond, you're rising from the head of Bank One to the head of JPMorgan Chase to the most important banker right now in the country and arguably the world.
[02:18:58.312 --> 02:19:07.255]  You are together, you keep each other up, and all these other systems that are in place, whether it's the Federal Reserve, the New York Federal Reserve, the Department of Justice that ignores that anything can possibly go wrong.
[02:19:07.255 --> 02:19:08.215]  Sure, that's how corruption works.
[02:19:08.215 --> 02:19:08.856]  That's how it happens.
[02:19:08.856 --> 02:19:09.256]  Right.
[02:19:09.256 --> 02:19:15.898]  Because once they allow it in place, no one can bust anybody or it brings it down, and then suddenly corruption just takes over.
[02:19:16.098 --> 02:19:19.220]  Right, they are the same people and it's mutually enforcing.
[02:19:19.220 --> 02:19:24.123]  It's enforcing within the banking industry on Wall Street and it's enforcing between Washington and Wall Street.
[02:19:24.123 --> 02:19:42.454]  And what has happened since the crisis of 2008 is this ability to take down the economy, this massive amount of debt here in Europe, the instability in the Middle East, all of this is connected to the fact that there was a financial crisis that was predicated on bankers
[02:19:43.174 --> 02:19:51.783]  Creating potential, you know, fuzzy value out of nothing, proliferating the world with it, and then having the governments come in and hold their hand.
[02:19:51.783 --> 02:19:52.284]  Absolutely.

[02:23:02.689 --> 02:23:06.971]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:23:06.971 --> 02:23:08.751]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:23:08.751 --> 02:23:16.614]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:23:16.614 --> 02:23:17.754]  But for how long?
[02:23:17.754 --> 02:23:24.396]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:23:24.396 --> 02:23:27.217]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:23:28.442 --> 02:23:29.563]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:29.563 --> 02:23:34.045]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:34.045 --> 02:23:39.767]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:23:39.767 --> 02:23:41.928]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[02:23:41.928 --> 02:23:43.349]  No word about IRAs.
[02:23:43.349 --> 02:23:46.010]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:46.010 --> 02:23:50.973]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:23:50.973 --> 02:23:51.313]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:51.313 --> 02:23:52.594]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:15.287 --> 02:24:18.529]  Her current best-selling book is It Takes a Pillage.
[02:24:18.529 --> 02:24:22.932]  Behind the bonuses, bailouts, and backroom deals from Washington to Wall Street.
[02:24:22.932 --> 02:24:23.692]  It's Naomi Prince.
[02:24:23.692 --> 02:24:25.674]  She was a managing director.
[02:24:26.835 --> 02:24:30.299]  I remember reading your first book about this in 2006.
[02:24:30.299 --> 02:24:41.294]  You were actually able to see all of it because in your position, weren't you like over the big international transfers and trying to make sure that the regulations matched on these deals?
[02:24:41.909 --> 02:24:43.310]  Yeah, that's a very good memory.
[02:24:43.310 --> 02:25:01.337]  I had been responsible for a particular group that focused on financial clients, insurance companies, banks, pension funds, and any basically financial investor, and try to look at how, if they were going to be seeing any losses, how those could be sort of repackaged and sold off of their books.
[02:25:01.337 --> 02:25:06.739]  If a bank was going through a potential loss or insurance company had some claims that weren't working, package them up.
[02:25:07.279 --> 02:25:10.500]  Reconstruct them into something else and sell them along to other investors.
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:11.401]  So there was a lot of that.
[02:25:11.401 --> 02:25:19.684]  And I was also responsible for the analytics in derivatives and credit derivatives, which became the center of all this stuff.
[02:25:19.684 --> 02:25:22.845]  And the nascent development of CDOs, which, you know, you talk about.
[02:25:22.845 --> 02:25:24.085]  You were right in the middle of it.
[02:25:24.085 --> 02:25:26.086]  I was in the middle of it before it became some prime.
[02:25:26.086 --> 02:25:27.266]  It was it was corporate debt.
[02:25:27.266 --> 02:25:30.288]  And you just watched Enron go to jail.
[02:25:30.288 --> 02:25:32.088]  That's the good part about people getting in trouble.
[02:25:32.088 --> 02:25:33.209]  It makes other people think.
[02:25:33.209 --> 02:25:34.069]  You said, I'm getting out of here.
[02:25:34.209 --> 02:25:36.430]  Well, I left before they went to jail.
[02:25:36.430 --> 02:25:37.871]  I knew when they were imploding.
[02:25:37.871 --> 02:25:44.114]  I knew when their positions were imploding, because Goldman was actually a trading partner in derivatives with Enron.
[02:25:44.114 --> 02:25:46.876]  So it was pretty easy to know what was going to go on.
[02:25:46.876 --> 02:25:49.897]  And that was around the fall, of course, of 9-11, and I wound up leaving.
[02:25:49.897 --> 02:25:50.578]  9-11 was very personal.
[02:25:53.799 --> 02:25:58.643]  ...for anyone who was working down on Wall Street at the time, and I was also an element of Life's Too Short.
[02:25:58.643 --> 02:26:00.504]  Oh wow, you were in New York when that happened?
[02:26:00.504 --> 02:26:05.287]  I was down on Goldman when that happened, which is a few blocks away from the World Trade Center.
[02:26:05.287 --> 02:26:09.030]  We're there with the darkened windows, not really knowing what's going on at that point.
[02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:11.752]  We're just inside a building before all the information started coming out.
[02:26:11.752 --> 02:26:18.296]  So as that came out, that was a big sort of call to examine all the things that I'd already been bothered about.
[02:26:18.296 --> 02:26:19.437]  A major reality check.
[02:26:19.577 --> 02:26:20.458]  Major, major.
[02:26:20.458 --> 02:26:23.001]  And I quit a few months after that.
[02:26:23.001 --> 02:26:25.664]  All of that was going on at the same time.
[02:26:25.664 --> 02:26:33.333]  There was the World Trade Center, there was 9-11, there was Enron's fraud, there was the upcoming telecom frauds that would all come out after I left.
[02:26:33.333 --> 02:26:34.574]  And a lot of that stuff going on.
[02:26:34.574 --> 02:26:37.137]  And the atmosphere was toxic.
[02:26:37.137 --> 02:26:38.779]  It always was.
[02:26:38.779 --> 02:26:40.401]  But it just became way too much.
[02:26:40.401 --> 02:26:45.805]  When we hear these recordings of Goldman Sachs guys bragging about, yeah, I'm gonna cheat these old ladies.
[02:26:45.805 --> 02:26:48.167]  Oh, that earthquake, that was my wallet dropping.
[02:26:48.167 --> 02:26:52.091]  Yeah, we're gonna sell these, you know, idiots this crud.
[02:26:52.091 --> 02:26:53.392]  I mean, how many of them are like that?
[02:26:54.393 --> 02:26:59.358]  There are some loudmouths who are definitely like that and there's ones that are more reserved.
[02:26:59.358 --> 02:27:05.344]  There's the old school bankers and there's the ones who have actually done quite well being like that.
[02:27:05.344 --> 02:27:13.291]  Going back to 9-11, when we were there on the trading floor and there was all the smoking stuff around, the oil guys were on the desk and their boss was saying like, hey, make money.
[02:27:14.332 --> 02:27:17.294]  Like, we don't know what's going on, no one knows what's going on, but you know what?
[02:27:17.294 --> 02:27:21.736]  It had to do with a plane, plane's oil, oil money, you know, keep trading.
[02:27:21.736 --> 02:27:31.442]  You know, that's the kind of environment that a lot of those types of guys are very, very... And then they're like, hey, just tell the firefighters that the dust isn't bad, so we can stay open.
[02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:34.303]  And don't tell them to wear respirators, because then they'll know it's bad.
[02:27:34.303 --> 02:27:35.624]  Then we'll have to close everything.
[02:27:35.624 --> 02:27:36.405]  Tell them it's safe!
[02:27:37.085 --> 02:27:40.388]  When they had a report hours after saying it's deadly.
[02:27:40.388 --> 02:27:41.529]  They had censors.
[02:27:41.529 --> 02:27:43.952]  Again, it just shows these people are out of their minds.
[02:27:43.952 --> 02:27:48.316]  They wanted us to all come down to work, you know, the next day, two days later when the city was mostly closed.
[02:27:48.316 --> 02:27:49.037]  I didn't come down.
[02:27:49.037 --> 02:27:53.681]  I mean, again, this was all sort of, you know, part of my own culminations of revelations over the years.
[02:27:53.681 --> 02:27:56.304]  But yeah, there was people down in those offices.
[02:27:57.452 --> 02:28:03.735]  Let me ask you this question, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, and then I want to get into whatever you think is most important to talk about.
[02:28:03.735 --> 02:28:10.259]  So tell me these questions aren't good, or aren't as important as they should be, or where to go.
[02:28:10.259 --> 02:28:11.279]  Where does it all end?
[02:28:11.279 --> 02:28:17.362]  I mean, I look at the derivatives, some numbers are 600 trillion, some are lower, some are higher.
[02:28:17.362 --> 02:28:20.263]  What is going to happen with all of this?
[02:28:20.263 --> 02:28:21.404]  Where does it end?
[02:28:21.404 --> 02:28:24.365]  Because they're only expanding all of it, from what I've seen.
[02:28:24.365 --> 02:28:25.026]  Where does it end?
[02:28:25.626 --> 02:28:25.926]  Right.
[02:28:25.926 --> 02:28:30.190]  The expansion happens from the fact that since the crisis, these banks that were big have gotten bigger.
[02:28:30.190 --> 02:28:31.372]  You know, they've been allowed to merge.
[02:28:31.372 --> 02:28:32.553]  They've had federal backing.
[02:28:32.553 --> 02:28:33.934]  They continue to have federal backing.
[02:28:33.934 --> 02:28:43.102]  They know they can continue with creating, you know, bigger derivatives positions, taking more fees off their regular clients to be able to grow what they're doing in the speculative world and so forth.
[02:28:43.102 --> 02:28:46.566]  But what they know right now is that they will be supported.
[02:28:47.466 --> 02:28:51.550]  So again, it's this mutual support system from the Federal Reserve and the ECB to keep the U.S.
[02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:57.375]  banks and the European banks, which basically control the entire global financial system, up as long as they can.
[02:28:57.375 --> 02:29:00.978]  So you create debt, you keep rates down low, you keep it going, you keep it going.
[02:29:00.978 --> 02:29:10.626]  Meanwhile, the derivatives positions, the more risky types of transactions in which these banks are operating, also continue to blow up because they're being...
[02:29:11.286 --> 02:29:12.127]  Supported.
[02:29:12.127 --> 02:29:13.248]  They've been bailed out.
[02:29:13.248 --> 02:29:15.509]  They're being supported to go on and go forward.
[02:29:15.509 --> 02:29:16.610]  I don't really think that ends.
[02:29:16.610 --> 02:29:33.844]  I think what's happening now is when there's this false period of, you know, an anesthetic of these types of bailout programs and these zero interest rates, which are just going to kind of keep things in an indefinite limbo until the next two drops, which I believe will happen because this cannot continue forever.
[02:29:34.690 --> 02:29:41.798]  And I want to talk about how big that next shoe will be, what's happening in the bond market, and so much more with Nomi Prins.
[02:29:41.798 --> 02:29:49.966]  Straight ahead, she was a managing director at Goldman Sachs and left, rather than be involved in all the corruption.
[02:29:49.966 --> 02:29:51.368]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.368 --> 02:29:53.911]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.911 --> 02:29:56.574]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.004 --> 02:30:04.427]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:30:04.427 --> 02:30:10.471]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:30:10.471 --> 02:30:14.354]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[02:30:14.354 --> 02:30:15.936]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[02:31:00.437 --> 02:31:05.161]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[02:31:05.161 --> 02:31:08.284]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:31:08.284 --> 02:31:13.849]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:13.849 --> 02:31:15.771]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:15.771 --> 02:31:17.413]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:17.413 --> 02:31:17.773]  Our food.
[02:31:17.793 --> 02:31:22.076]  Food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:22.076 --> 02:31:26.299]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:26.299 --> 02:31:28.861]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:28.861 --> 02:31:35.085]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:28.736 --> 02:32:36.061]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:32:36.061 --> 02:32:46.967]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[02:33:08.084 --> 02:33:09.805]  You got a business.
[02:33:09.805 --> 02:33:11.626]  You didn't build that.
[02:33:11.626 --> 02:33:13.127]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:33:20.795 --> 02:33:25.698]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:25.698 --> 02:33:27.039]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:33:31.178 --> 02:33:37.401]  All right, it takes a pill.
[02:33:37.401 --> 02:33:38.381]  It's her latest book.
[02:33:38.381 --> 02:33:39.702]  She's got another book coming out soon.
[02:33:39.702 --> 02:33:40.642]  We're going to talk about that.
[02:33:40.642 --> 02:33:44.423]  I know we've got callers I've been holding before she got on all over the map.
[02:33:44.423 --> 02:33:50.346]  We'll take your calls, a little bit of overdrive, while she gets some lunch, and I'm going to interview her for Obama Deception 2.
[02:33:50.346 --> 02:33:54.047]  So I'll be going into the third hour someday, as I seem to do all the time.
[02:33:54.047 --> 02:33:55.128]  You know, I quit doing four hours.
[02:33:55.828 --> 02:34:00.171]  Every day a few years ago, because I needed to get rid of the nightly news and build the media operation.
[02:34:00.171 --> 02:34:02.412]  But then why not just go back to four hours?
[02:34:02.412 --> 02:34:06.975]  It's like I quit doing the four hours, some stations quit carrying it, and now I'm back to doing four hours.
[02:34:06.975 --> 02:34:09.617]  But there's just so much to cover.
[02:34:09.617 --> 02:34:13.439]  But first, some of our sponsors that make this broadcast possible.
[02:34:13.439 --> 02:34:14.760]  PrivateInternetAccess.com.
[02:34:16.294 --> 02:34:23.562]  We hear news stories every day about NSA spying on US citizens, keeping your information private on the web has never been more important.

[02:34:52.527 --> 02:34:53.107]  Great folks.
[02:34:53.107 --> 02:34:55.389]  PrivateInternetAccess.com.
[02:34:55.389 --> 02:34:58.971]  Also, InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:34:58.971 --> 02:35:04.075]  Unlike ceramic armor that only stops six rounds, this stops hundreds.
[02:35:04.075 --> 02:35:05.676]  Stops hundreds of rounds from AK-47, M4, .30-06, .308, and more.
[02:35:09.538 --> 02:35:11.860]  Fits, sizes medium to XXL.
[02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:13.260]  We got a bunch of other products as well.
[02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:14.501]  Backpacks, you name it.
[02:35:14.501 --> 02:35:15.282]  Amazing stuff.
[02:35:15.282 --> 02:35:16.402]  Made in America.
[02:35:16.402 --> 02:35:19.324]  Rated to level 4 body armor.
[02:35:19.324 --> 02:35:22.005]  888-608-6605.
[02:35:22.005 --> 02:35:25.988]  The longest lasting body armor is now cheaper than most ammo for the first time.
[02:35:26.468 --> 02:35:27.368]  By the pound.
[02:35:27.368 --> 02:35:30.029]  Infidelbodyarmor.com.

[02:35:36.111 --> 02:35:38.532]  This special ends tomorrow.
[02:35:38.532 --> 02:35:40.633]  They've never done a special like this.
[02:35:40.633 --> 02:35:48.356]  You buy three of any of their huge selections of storable foods, you get the fourth free, plus free shipping.
[02:35:48.356 --> 02:35:51.017]  They rarely do free shipping, so that's a double whammy of goodness.
[02:35:52.097 --> 02:35:54.318]  And we do this because all of us should be prepared.
[02:35:54.318 --> 02:36:02.340]  All of us should hope for the best, prepare for the worst, have a strong offense against the globalists, while preparing a defense in fallback positions.
[02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:03.100]  This is serious.
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:04.861]  The government's stockpiling food as well.
[02:36:04.861 --> 02:36:08.022]  The place to get it is efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[02:36:08.022 --> 02:36:11.023]  And don't forget all our other great products and videos and films and everything.
[02:36:16.224 --> 02:36:17.605]  Infowarsstore.com
[02:36:46.704 --> 02:36:51.889]  And now she's got several other books that are out as well.
[02:36:51.889 --> 02:36:56.692]  But expanding, you were saying during the break things about Obama I want to get to in a moment.
[02:36:56.692 --> 02:37:01.096]  But first off, Naomi, get into my big question.
[02:37:01.096 --> 02:37:03.297]  How do you expect things to unravel?
[02:37:03.297 --> 02:37:10.103]  How do the experts you respect that have a good track record of predicting things, how do they say the next shoe will drop and what it will look like?
[02:37:11.365 --> 02:37:13.166]  And what's happening in these rig markets?
[02:37:13.166 --> 02:37:24.210]  How long will it go as we learn about LIBOR and the fixing of interest rates and the fact that high frequency trading, I mean, this thing is a giant rig casino ripping people off.
[02:37:24.210 --> 02:37:25.570]  How will it melt down?
[02:37:25.570 --> 02:37:26.751]  Will it melt down?
[02:37:26.751 --> 02:37:30.172]  And if it doesn't melt down, what will it do at the expense of the people?
[02:37:31.122 --> 02:37:51.816]  First of all, this historic period right now, we have had a longer series of cheap money of 0% interest rates of the Federal Reserve, the ECB, bolstering all of the financial toxic assets that were built, the financial system that was being proliferated into the world and how that was going to self-destruct.
[02:37:52.176 --> 02:37:53.818]  It continues to hold it up.
[02:37:53.818 --> 02:37:55.739]  The stock market is held up by this.
[02:37:55.739 --> 02:38:11.253]  Any corporate profits of the companies that are larger and that are still posting corporate profits, although they're not really hiring, they are posting profits, are doing so because it is so cheap for them, not individuals, but for banks and for their main customers to raise money.
[02:38:11.633 --> 02:38:17.636]  This is why it looks, there's the appearance between the stock market and some of the corporate bond market that things are healthy.
[02:38:17.636 --> 02:38:20.098]  There's the appearance that banks are doing okay.
[02:38:20.098 --> 02:38:31.344]  They haven't had to because of accounting laws that have been changed in 2008 when the financial crisis happened that have allowed them to really camouflage losses that they continue to carry on their books.
[02:38:31.344 --> 02:38:37.848]  Meanwhile, they've expanded derivatives and all sorts of other esoteric things they're doing because it doesn't cost them anything to do that.
[02:38:37.848 --> 02:38:38.988]  That's the market we're in right now.
[02:38:38.988 --> 02:38:40.209]  Synthetic derivatives?
[02:38:40.609 --> 02:38:47.794]  Synthetic derivatives basically mean creating packages of packages of packages of things that have no value.
[02:38:47.794 --> 02:38:54.839]  And the reason these packages of things that have no value, which were supposed to... Take a loan, a regular simple basic loan.
[02:38:54.839 --> 02:38:59.362]  You pay me an interest rate, I take a piece of it, I pay my expenses, I make some profit.
[02:39:00.062 --> 02:39:08.871]  You do that a ton, a ton of times and the loan has no value because the asset underneath it has gone to zero and you create a derivative and another derivative and you repackage and repackage.
[02:39:08.871 --> 02:39:10.832]  You're basically running on fumes.
[02:39:10.832 --> 02:39:12.614]  And then it's hidden under red tape.
[02:39:12.614 --> 02:39:20.781]  It's hidden under accounting laws that are effectively designed to camouflage these losses so that they give the appearance that these banks are in a health state.
[02:39:20.781 --> 02:39:21.202]  So where does it go?
[02:39:21.202 --> 02:39:21.822]  When does it end?
[02:39:23.516 --> 02:39:29.958]  The Federal Reserve has been very tactical in keeping these rates at the zero levels that they are.
[02:39:29.958 --> 02:39:46.805]  And every single time Bernanke comes out and says the economy might be getting a little better, and there might be a possibility that QE, quantitative easing, or the Fed buying the debt that is manufactured by banks and by the Treasury Department to keep this all going and keep rates low, every time that happens the market wobbles, everybody freaks out.
[02:39:47.245 --> 02:39:50.568]  And Bernanke comes back and says something like, oh, you know what, it actually kind of is bad.
[02:39:50.568 --> 02:39:51.889]  We're going to keep going with this.
[02:39:51.889 --> 02:39:54.752]  And then everything's all fine again.
[02:39:54.752 --> 02:40:00.177]  Visually in the market and in the bond market, the reality is it's not real.
[02:40:00.177 --> 02:40:02.319]  These are all artificially being lifted.
[02:40:02.319 --> 02:40:03.500]  How long does that last?
[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:06.983]  It's lasted at this point for four and a half years.
[02:40:06.983 --> 02:40:11.367]  It can continue to last for another year and a half, too, because he can't really take his foot off.
[02:40:11.827 --> 02:40:12.607]  Quantitative easing.
[02:40:12.607 --> 02:40:16.448]  And whoever comes in after Bernanke is going to have a really tough time doing the same thing.
[02:40:16.448 --> 02:40:18.529]  I believe this policy is going to continue.
[02:40:18.529 --> 02:40:21.510]  Meanwhile, the European economies are imploding.
[02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:22.510]  The real U.S.
[02:40:22.510 --> 02:40:30.353]  economy isn't doing very well if you take away the bigger banks and institutions benefiting from cheap money, from zero interest rate money.
[02:40:30.353 --> 02:40:37.995]  So I think this continues this time another few years with slow implosion at the center, at the core economies in Europe, in the Middle East, in the U.S.
[02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:39.376]  Which is what they've said.
[02:40:39.376 --> 02:40:40.696]  They want slow implosion.
[02:40:40.936 --> 02:40:41.777]  It's a slow bleed.
[02:40:41.777 --> 02:40:44.959]  That's exactly what's going on now, which is different from before.
[02:40:44.959 --> 02:40:54.945]  Before, rates were sort of normal, they came low, banks were doing all sorts of creativity with subprime loans and creating all these toxic assets and getting into the derivatives market and everything else.
[02:40:54.945 --> 02:40:57.127]  Now, it's all been subsidized.
[02:40:57.127 --> 02:41:01.950]  So now this can continue for another, it's not as quick to the next few comes down.
[02:41:02.470 --> 02:41:26.562]  I think it could take more like three or four years, but a very slow, painful time until that happens, until derivatives are so expansive, until there cannot be more money pumped in, until the debt is so high that it can't be kept at zero because nobody wants to buy it, no country, no funds, and there's just no cash left to set aside to do this, and that's when I think you get the next implosion, but I don't think that's for another few years.
[02:41:26.562 --> 02:41:27.903]  I think it's a slow drip until then.
[02:41:27.903 --> 02:41:30.044]  And is it going to be a lot bigger when it implodes next?
[02:41:30.824 --> 02:41:32.385]  There's a lot more riding on it.
[02:41:32.385 --> 02:41:33.425]  There's a lot more riding on it.
[02:41:33.425 --> 02:41:34.746]  There's a bigger derivatives market.
[02:41:34.746 --> 02:41:37.547]  These banks have grown bigger, the ones that have survived.
[02:41:37.547 --> 02:41:38.507]  What about the bond market?
[02:41:38.507 --> 02:41:43.569]  We're seeing more talk of the Chinese currency being more the world reserve currency.
[02:41:43.569 --> 02:41:50.712]  Other countries and groups are moving away from the dollar, and now they're starting to cut back on the Treasuries, but then they use the dollar imploding.
[02:41:50.712 --> 02:41:52.052]  People get scared and come and prop it up.
[02:41:52.052 --> 02:41:54.853]  It kind of seesaws back and forth.
[02:41:54.853 --> 02:41:58.735]  What's happening in the bond market in layman's terms?
[02:41:58.735 --> 02:41:59.535]  What does that signify?
[02:42:01.086 --> 02:42:01.226]  That's
[02:42:22.657 --> 02:42:24.718]  Which should be a lot lower.
[02:42:24.718 --> 02:42:33.763]  It should represent a lot less value in the external, in the markets than it does because everything is being propped up.
[02:42:33.763 --> 02:42:43.547]  If the purchasers of treasury bonds stop buying or start selling, the Chinese start selling, the Japanese start selling, it hurts them too.
[02:42:43.547 --> 02:42:46.809]  As you just said, so everybody... So we're sitting on top of powder keg.
[02:42:46.989 --> 02:42:47.669]  We're playing on the same game.
[02:42:47.669 --> 02:42:49.310]  Everyone's in the same game right now.
[02:42:49.310 --> 02:42:53.350]  But they're depressing the real economy while expanding their own economy.
[02:42:53.350 --> 02:42:54.931]  That's why all the luxury goods go up.
[02:42:54.931 --> 02:42:58.491]  Other stuff only grows slowly in inflation.
[02:42:58.491 --> 02:43:07.333]  But I've just seen where real interest rates for the general public are going up, and then now they have this supposed, you know, zero percent.
[02:43:07.333 --> 02:43:08.754]  But that's only for the insiders.
[02:43:08.754 --> 02:43:10.534]  That's becoming more and more obvious.
[02:43:10.534 --> 02:43:11.754]  How long can that go on?
[02:43:11.754 --> 02:43:15.155]  Because I'm seeing the attitude in the general public
[02:43:16.789 --> 02:43:18.530]  Become hyper-aware.
[02:43:18.530 --> 02:43:30.277]  I mean, you've got some that'll buy anything, but I'm seeing on talk radio, listening to other shows, and I'm seeing on the streets, and I'm seeing in Gallup poll, lowest approval rating ever for the media, and for Congress, and for Obama.
[02:43:30.277 --> 02:43:35.780]  I don't think people are buying into the bull anymore, and so how long can this go?
[02:43:36.975 --> 02:43:43.637]  Again, I think individuals, the real economy, do understand and do see costs going up.
[02:43:43.637 --> 02:43:46.777]  Healthcare costs, education costs, food costs, you know.
[02:43:46.777 --> 02:43:50.158]  The cost of living versus what... Plus the education doesn't do anything anymore.
[02:43:50.158 --> 02:43:51.719]  You can't get out and get a job.
[02:43:51.719 --> 02:43:54.519]  Or you can get a couple jobs that don't really pay you, don't get benefits, whatever it is.
[02:43:54.519 --> 02:43:56.220]  Yeah, I mean, globalism's killing us.
[02:43:56.220 --> 02:43:56.780]  It doesn't work.
[02:43:56.980 --> 02:44:08.813]  The quality of the real economy is deteriorating, while the artificiality of this banking economy continues to be subsidized by cheap money, which the rest of the public can't get to.
[02:44:08.813 --> 02:44:11.596]  Because banks are sitting on it, because they have the benefit, they don't pass it on.
[02:44:12.236 --> 02:44:14.957]  Again, I think that continues for another few years.
[02:44:14.957 --> 02:44:19.358]  It continues until someone says, you know what, the Fed has to dial back.
[02:44:19.358 --> 02:44:29.942]  Because the United States and the banking system of the United States and the Federal Reserve that basically is the banker's bank in the United States continues to create a policy that makes them all look good.
[02:44:30.382 --> 02:44:32.423]  Well, it doesn't do anything for the real economy.
[02:44:32.423 --> 02:44:34.044]  So we're continuing to fragment.
[02:44:34.044 --> 02:44:39.646]  So it's good that people are looking at their own lives and trying to sort of detach themselves as much as they can.
[02:44:39.646 --> 02:44:43.008]  But at the same time, it's going to deteriorate the quality.
[02:44:43.008 --> 02:44:44.948]  Let me ask you this.
[02:44:44.948 --> 02:44:46.589]  And obviously, it's not just making them look good.
[02:44:46.589 --> 02:44:48.150]  They're hoarding the bailout money.
[02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:50.871]  They're becoming just so fabulously rich.
[02:44:50.871 --> 02:44:51.691]  It's a joke.
[02:44:51.691 --> 02:44:54.933]  How will they spend the money if they wreck the entire society?
[02:44:57.183 --> 02:45:02.105]  As you say, luxury goods, on saving it away, on why does Jamie Dimon get to make $10 million a year?
[02:45:02.105 --> 02:45:10.668]  I mean, all these things continue to allow them to hoard institutionally and to hoard for themselves personally, and that's definitely what they're doing.
[02:45:10.668 --> 02:45:11.888]  Well, let me expand on this.
[02:45:11.888 --> 02:45:14.729]  They're building government bunkers, they're hoarding food.
[02:45:14.729 --> 02:45:16.290]  Goldman Sachs people are buying guns.
[02:45:16.290 --> 02:45:17.990]  That's come out in Bloomberg.
[02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:19.771]  They're digging in, they're buying retreats.
[02:45:19.771 --> 02:45:20.571]  Why are they doing that?
[02:45:20.891 --> 02:45:22.152]  Why do they have the money now?
[02:45:22.152 --> 02:45:30.719]  They have the money now and they know at some point there might be an inavailability to get some of these things because there won't be enough people creating them.
[02:45:30.719 --> 02:45:33.702]  Individual economies will be so bad there's going to be a deterioration on that side.
[02:45:33.702 --> 02:45:35.844]  So what they're doing is they're taking their money and running.
[02:45:35.844 --> 02:45:37.946]  It's a definition of not being left with the bag.
[02:45:37.946 --> 02:45:43.770]  If they have the money now, if they have cheap rates now, if they're getting great bonuses now, if the stock market's up high now, they're in there first.
[02:45:44.691 --> 02:45:50.012]  And so when the stock market does come down, dramatically, and we saw it can happen from 2000... No, no, but that's my point.
[02:45:50.012 --> 02:45:54.493]  They're digging in like it's the end of the world and they're going to have a civil war with us.
[02:45:54.493 --> 02:45:56.573]  I mean, I have the FBI training manuals.
[02:45:56.573 --> 02:46:01.374]  I mean, they're training to mass arrest people and stuff and take over cities.
[02:46:01.374 --> 02:46:05.895]  And I mean, they're acting like they're going to bring us into a total depression.
[02:46:05.895 --> 02:46:11.616]  And the more money they have at the top of that pile, the more protected they are from what's happening to the rest of
[02:46:12.276 --> 02:46:14.598]  But how about they all just get arrested like Bernie Madoff?
[02:46:14.598 --> 02:46:17.100]  Because I've talked to Ron Paul and a lot of people I respect.
[02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:21.202]  They say there's ways to fix this for the general public that are fair and constitutional.
[02:46:21.202 --> 02:46:23.324]  Why do we let these crooks run everything?
[02:46:23.324 --> 02:46:27.027]  I mean, it's the question of, like, why do women like bad guys?
[02:46:27.027 --> 02:46:28.388]  You know, that old joke.
[02:46:28.388 --> 02:46:31.390]  I just do not get why we let these crooks run everything.
[02:46:32.506 --> 02:46:35.647]  Those crooks are the government right now, and that's the problem.
[02:46:35.647 --> 02:46:38.529]  Bernie Madoff was not part of the fraternity.
[02:46:38.529 --> 02:46:44.031]  Oh, the Justice Department, the law firm that the Attorney General's part of, is the one that does the certifications on all this fraud.
[02:46:44.031 --> 02:46:50.154]  Right, and all these people who create all this fraud are the ones who supported the current administration in doing what they do.
[02:46:50.154 --> 02:46:52.355]  They're all mutually enforcing each other.
[02:46:52.355 --> 02:46:53.595]  That's why they don't arrest each other.
[02:46:53.595 --> 02:46:55.936]  You point a finger at one, somebody goes down, everybody else goes down.
[02:46:55.936 --> 02:46:57.397]  Diamond goes down, everyone goes down, right?
[02:46:57.397 --> 02:46:58.477]  He's connected to everybody.
[02:46:58.477 --> 02:47:00.158]  And how is the cult of Obama
[02:47:01.759 --> 02:47:10.455]  Allowed them could have Bush if he had a third term have gotten away with this and and has Obama been better or worse than Bush on letting banks run wild?
[02:47:11.445 --> 02:47:15.389]  Bush came to office with a lot of initial banker support.
[02:47:15.389 --> 02:47:26.361]  When he was just a senator, when he won the Trump State Senate, Obama, and I'll go back to Bush, but when basically he came in, he already had Goldman Sachs behind him as one of his top 20 donors.
[02:47:26.361 --> 02:47:27.462]  This is not into the president.
[02:47:27.462 --> 02:47:29.084]  This is into the Senate seat.
[02:47:31.306 --> 02:47:34.328]  JPMorgan, as JPMorgan Chase is one of his donors, etc.
[02:47:34.328 --> 02:47:48.538]  He was in Chicago before that, where Bank One, which has now become part of JPMorgan Chase, and that's what Jamie Dimon used to run, was there at the same time, you know, in the same Chicago tower near wherever it is, you know, the Senate is, when he was a local state senator, and so forth.
[02:47:48.538 --> 02:47:52.581]  I mean, they basically have had a relationship going back before he even set foot.
[02:47:52.901 --> 02:47:54.722]  He's been fast-tracked from the beginning.
[02:47:54.722 --> 02:47:56.664]  From the beginning.
[02:47:56.664 --> 02:48:03.008]  Bush did, of course, sign the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act in 2008.
[02:48:03.008 --> 02:48:04.749]  Obama lobbied for it.
[02:48:04.749 --> 02:48:10.534]  Obama lobbied for it, but Bush did sign it, and Bush did say, and this is in his memoirs, you know, we're going all-in.
[02:48:10.534 --> 02:48:18.619]  Now, when he said we're going all-in, it was before 2009 when there really was an all-in situation, when the Fed came in and created all these additional programs.
[02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:20.120]  I don't
[02:48:42.688 --> 02:48:45.029]  But they worked together under Bush beforehand.
[02:48:45.029 --> 02:48:47.230]  So to some extent, there was a transition into it.
[02:48:47.230 --> 02:48:51.413]  But Obama came in with a lot of backing from the banking system.
[02:48:51.413 --> 02:48:56.835]  And he came in with no regard to creating smaller banks from these bigger banks.
[02:48:56.835 --> 02:49:00.757]  I mean, he could have had a policy where he could have directed Congress.
[02:49:00.757 --> 02:49:05.780]  I mean, you told me on air he was worse than Bush.
[02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:09.022]  He was worse in terms of allowing these banks to become bigger.
[02:49:09.742 --> 02:49:20.388]  And more powerful, and have more federal subsidies, and in the process... Sure, from what I've seen, they've been waging war on real local banks, and now they're trying to take over credit unions.
[02:49:21.007 --> 02:49:21.808]  Because they can.
[02:49:21.808 --> 02:49:26.131]  Again, they have access to more of it more easily.
[02:49:26.131 --> 02:49:28.453]  They're larger member banks of the Federal Reserve System.
[02:49:28.453 --> 02:49:33.558]  They get to be able to have the position of being the big guy and beating up the little guy.
[02:49:33.558 --> 02:49:34.919]  And this has been happening in U.S.
[02:49:34.919 --> 02:49:35.820]  history for the last hundred years.
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:40.724]  But it's been happening in particular in the last several years because they have been validated.
[02:49:40.984 --> 02:49:42.224]  Yeah, we don't have a war.
[02:49:42.224 --> 02:49:53.227]  We just have zero interest rates and a policy between Washington and Wall Street that enables these largest institutions to get increasingly bigger on cheaper money.
[02:49:53.227 --> 02:49:54.947]  It's a total banking takeover.
[02:49:54.947 --> 02:49:56.308]  It's a total takeover.
[02:49:56.308 --> 02:50:06.010]  I mean, I read the local banking association stuff in the Austin Business Journal and stuff, and the head of the Texas Banking Association sounds like Ron Paul or myself or you.
[02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:10.694]  I mean, what we're saying is not radical vision of this.
[02:50:10.694 --> 02:50:12.436]  This is what's going on.
[02:50:12.436 --> 02:50:18.923]  We've got foreign mega offshore above-the-law banks who engineered all this, using it to take over.
[02:50:18.923 --> 02:50:23.929]  I had an article yesterday where they're in Congress right now trying to take away tax exemption from credit unions.
[02:50:25.410 --> 02:50:26.972]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:50:26.972 --> 02:50:31.899]  It's a way to hurt the smaller ones and the ones that are lobbying for that, of course, the bigger institutions who want control.
[02:50:31.899 --> 02:50:34.763]  Who wrote the tax laws and don't even pay taxes anyways.
[02:50:34.763 --> 02:50:37.708]  And have a lot more lobbyists working for them.
[02:50:37.708 --> 02:50:41.232]  I mean, if we let them shut down the credit unions, I mean, is there no end to this?
[02:50:42.481 --> 02:50:50.912]  That's why we have to basically say, you know, we're going to continue to support credit unions or local banks, because they're not going to say, OK, we're going to back out.
[02:50:50.912 --> 02:50:54.416]  Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, they're not going to stay out.
[02:50:54.416 --> 02:50:57.399]  You have to basically give your business to the smaller institutions.
[02:50:57.399 --> 02:50:57.960]  Absolutely.
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:58.541]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.101 --> 02:51:04.584]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.

[02:51:13.911 --> 02:51:20.156]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[02:51:20.436 --> 02:51:22.499]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[02:54:24.333 --> 02:54:27.315]  They've now banned all computers.
[02:54:27.315 --> 02:54:29.536]  Florida outlaws all computers.
[02:54:29.536 --> 02:54:39.260]  Legislation was signed into law by Florida's former Tea Party favorite, Rick Scott, that bans all computers because they didn't properly read the bill.
[02:54:40.413 --> 02:54:43.414]  Totally bizarre, got that article, a bunch of other important news.
[02:54:43.414 --> 02:54:46.335]  TSA harasses and shames yet another disabled veteran.
[02:54:46.335 --> 02:54:47.996]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[02:54:47.996 --> 02:54:51.097]  Canadian cop gives homeless woman lunch money.
[02:54:51.097 --> 02:54:56.419]  That story won't go viral, though we should show people good behavior to try to model off that.
[02:54:56.419 --> 02:54:59.941]  Sustainable Development Park violates Artists' First Amendment rights.
[02:54:59.941 --> 02:55:03.702]  TSA sniffing bags at Texas shopping mall.
[02:55:03.702 --> 02:55:06.743]  Heart-eating cannibal demands Obama send more weapons.
[02:55:06.743 --> 02:55:07.984]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[02:55:08.924 --> 02:55:12.367]  Police, firefighters ordered not to speak about Michael Hastings' crash.
[02:55:12.367 --> 02:55:22.575]  We're in a little bit of overdrive with you, Naomi, so you can get into your new book that's coming out next year and the research, but I also want to get your take on the Michael Hastings.
[02:55:22.575 --> 02:55:36.365]  Now it's coming out that the police won't release the police report, and they've told police and firefighters don't talk about what they saw, but the witnesses saw it blow up driving down the street, and he said he was going into hiding, he'd had death threats, and was about to break a big story.
[02:55:36.365 --> 02:55:38.227]  Gee, sounds like there should be an investigation to me.
[02:55:39.508 --> 02:55:48.159]  Yeah, you know, I had seen Michael Hastings a few weeks before that event at a book party actually for Dirty Wars.
[02:55:48.159 --> 02:55:53.246]  A friend of his, Jeremy Scahill, you know, great film, great movie, great book.
[02:55:53.246 --> 02:55:56.029]  And I walked over to the site the day after.
[02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:57.431]  I don't know.
[02:56:15.299 --> 02:56:18.380]  Easy types of, you know, there's a road that goes straight.
[02:56:18.380 --> 02:56:22.701]  Highland is, you know, it's a very easy double lane road.
[02:56:22.701 --> 02:56:34.924]  You know, Melrose Cutting, it's very visual, it's very, you know, even if you're going pretty fast at four in the morning for whatever reason you might be doing it, it's hard to imagine, you know, missing that on your own.
[02:56:34.924 --> 02:56:37.264]  You know, and hitting a tree on your own.
[02:56:37.264 --> 02:56:41.505]  I don't know what he was doing there in the middle of the night, of course.
[02:56:41.505 --> 02:56:44.546]  Sure, but the witnesses say it blew up in the middle of the street and then went over by the tree.
[02:56:45.596 --> 02:56:47.576]  And then now they're saying don't release the police report.
[02:56:47.576 --> 02:56:48.957]  I mean, this is this is amazing.
[02:56:48.957 --> 02:56:56.138]  The fact that they're not releasing the police report, the fact that, you know, the FBI basically said we weren't even, you know, looking at him for any reason at all.
[02:56:56.138 --> 02:56:58.139]  I mean, this guy was doing intense things.
[02:56:58.139 --> 02:57:00.499]  Well, it turns out that the family and friends say no, they did.
[02:57:00.499 --> 02:57:03.540]  They were visited and they're all scared because they see the FBI.
[02:57:03.540 --> 02:57:04.500]  I've talked to them.
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:08.281]  They see the FBI on the news saying we didn't visit them and they did.
[02:57:08.281 --> 02:57:08.661]  And they're like.
[02:57:09.381 --> 02:57:10.381]  I mean, they know now.
[02:57:10.381 --> 02:57:11.202]  They're all scared.
[02:57:11.202 --> 02:57:16.263]  Just the fact that the FBI denied everything, because, you know, usually it would be like, well, we can't comment.
[02:57:16.263 --> 02:57:24.845]  There was a strong denial that they were looking into him or doing anything, instead of a just we can't comment, which in itself is a little odd.
[02:57:24.845 --> 02:57:30.767]  But just the physicality of the location, you know, just seemed like...
[02:57:31.787 --> 02:57:38.499]  It more lends itself to being something that happened in advance of him taking over the car, him driving the car.
[02:57:38.499 --> 02:57:38.800]  Sure, sure.
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:39.561]  What does the tree look like?
[02:57:41.989 --> 02:57:43.010]  The tree is pretty solid.
[02:57:43.010 --> 02:57:50.233]  I mean, it's a fat tree, so if anything was hitting it for whatever reason, whether it was pre-explosion or post-explosion, the tree wasn't going to be going anywhere.
[02:57:50.233 --> 02:58:01.919]  But at the same time, if you were just driving regularly, even if you were under the influence, which we don't even know, I'm not saying he was, I'm just saying any person, if they were, there's a ton of space to continue to going straight.
[02:58:02.199 --> 02:58:07.043]  I've hit an oak tree backwards at about 60 because a tornado blew me and my dad off the road.
[02:58:07.043 --> 02:58:11.126]  And I mean, it still hammered in about 8 inches into the tree.
[02:58:11.126 --> 02:58:13.007]  I mean, it gouged a big thing out of it.
[02:58:13.007 --> 02:58:15.009]  It was actually two oak trees.
[02:58:15.009 --> 02:58:16.450]  One big one, one medium-sized.
[02:58:16.450 --> 02:58:18.091]  I mean, how torn up did the tree look?
[02:58:18.091 --> 02:58:19.853]  The tree didn't look particularly torn up.
[02:58:19.853 --> 02:58:22.915]  Because what I've seen from the photos, it came resting up against the tree.
[02:58:22.915 --> 02:58:25.677]  Blew up the street, no skid marks, up against the tree.
[02:58:25.677 --> 02:58:25.817]  Right.

[03:00:10.334 --> 03:00:11.916]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.916 --> 03:00:13.457]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.457 --> 03:00:17.661]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.661 --> 03:00:21.746]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.803 --> 03:00:40.797]  You were telling me during the break before last about your research into how the bankers have been broken up before.
[03:00:40.797 --> 03:00:42.600]  Tell the audience about that, Nomi Prince.
[03:00:43.223 --> 03:00:56.555]  Yeah, I've been doing a lot of research for this book, the new one, All the Presidents, Bankers, and I go back to Teddy Roosevelt but through now and all the alliances between bankers and presidents and kind of what went on behind the scenes and how they sort of interact.
[03:00:56.555 --> 03:01:08.966]  And in particular Glass-Steagall, right, we've just come out of currently a financial crisis where banks have been made bigger rather than smaller, where they have been consolidated rather than split up, and where we are therefore less stable as a global economy because of that.
[03:01:09.446 --> 03:01:15.490]  Back in the 30s, of course, there was a Great Depression following the crash in 1929, and a lot of shady deals that went into that crash.
[03:01:15.490 --> 03:01:24.295]  But the difference between then and now, between FDR and Obama, who says he models himself after FDR, FDR also had a lot of friends who were bankers.
[03:01:24.295 --> 03:01:25.116]  He grew up with them.
[03:01:25.116 --> 03:01:25.576]  He hung out.
[03:01:25.576 --> 03:01:26.997]  They yachted.
[03:01:26.997 --> 03:01:28.778]  They knew each other for decades.
[03:01:29.358 --> 03:01:49.851]  But what he did was he understood that the banking system had to be stabilized, and bankers at the time, the two top bankers at the time, the head of what has now become Citigroup, Jim Perkins, who was head of National Citibank, and Winthrop Aldrich, who was in the Rockefeller family, but head of Chase at the time, went to FDR.
[03:01:49.851 --> 03:01:54.534]  They had a meeting two days after FDR took office, and they agreed, the three of them,
[03:01:55.194 --> 03:02:01.639]  Winthrop wasn't there, National City Bank guy was, that he was going to split up his bank before the legislation passed.
[03:02:01.639 --> 03:02:10.587]  They said, we will split up the investment and trading, the speculation side, from the commercial banking, the side that deals with real people and real deposits and, you know, real loans.
[03:02:11.127 --> 03:02:15.351]  Because we are facing a large problem and it will only get bigger if we do not do this.
[03:02:15.351 --> 03:02:18.053]  If we don't take the risk out of the banking system.
[03:02:18.053 --> 03:02:19.615]  So yeah, they were self-interested.
[03:02:19.615 --> 03:02:22.157]  But what FDR did was say, okay, I'm going to push that.
[03:02:22.157 --> 03:02:23.979]  The bankers were going to push that.
[03:02:23.979 --> 03:02:26.441]  The population was fine with that.
[03:02:26.441 --> 03:02:28.322]  You know, they got deposit insurance out of it.
[03:02:28.322 --> 03:02:29.864]  Everybody was happy.
[03:02:29.864 --> 03:02:31.745]  And the system was stable for decades.
[03:02:32.523 --> 03:02:38.646]  You look at now, and we had a situation where the financial crisis was arguably bigger because it was more diffuse than what happened.
[03:02:38.646 --> 03:02:42.408]  Sure, and they're doing more of the same instead of even reversing it in any way.
[03:02:42.408 --> 03:02:50.071]  And looking at this, for those that don't understand what we're talking about, they have fractional reserve banking in the regular banking system that already gives them unfair trade advantages while they run everything.
[03:02:50.071 --> 03:02:55.614]  But they can always have these derivatives-type, fraudulent, you know, other type of speculative banking.
[03:02:55.614 --> 03:02:59.456]  You certainly want that to be on its own for people that want to go down to the racetrack and be involved in that.
[03:03:00.436 --> 03:03:12.981]  No, what they've done is they've involved everybody and the whole currency and the whole country and the whole world in their big fraud and we're saying that needs to be at least separated off and they won't even do that.
[03:03:12.981 --> 03:03:21.084]  Right, so the same bankers that had the opportunity, you know, different legacy bankers, but had the opportunity to do this and save the system and corner off the risky stuff.
[03:03:21.784 --> 03:03:24.366]  Did it then, and now they're not even considering doing it.
[03:03:24.366 --> 03:03:25.547]  Now they want to go away from that.
[03:03:25.547 --> 03:03:28.548]  Now they're lobbying against anything like that.
[03:03:28.548 --> 03:03:32.371]  But also, the president did nothing about that.
[03:03:32.371 --> 03:03:34.412]  He didn't say that the banks should be split out.
[03:03:34.412 --> 03:03:47.401]  He didn't say the rational thing to do, rather than mingle some normal, everyday person's money with these giants who can speculate it away, and then get subsidized where the normal person doesn't.
[03:03:48.621 --> 03:03:50.062]  No one's trying to do any of that.
[03:03:50.062 --> 03:03:52.044]  Very few people are trying to do anything like that in Washington.
[03:03:52.044 --> 03:03:57.147]  It's not going to happen right now with the people that we have running the White House and running the banking system.
[03:03:57.147 --> 03:03:58.969]  It just won't happen like it did back then.
[03:03:58.969 --> 03:04:05.133]  And therefore, we're still in a less stable environment than we were, Ian, coming out of the Great Depression.
[03:04:05.133 --> 03:04:07.335]  In closing, look at carbon taxes.
[03:04:07.335 --> 03:04:09.596]  There's a lot of real environmental issues with the carbon taxes.
[03:04:09.596 --> 03:04:14.360]  Goldman Sachs came up with it with Enron, on record, back in the mid-90s, Al Gore.
[03:04:15.479 --> 03:04:17.380]  And now they're saying that'll fund things.
[03:04:17.380 --> 03:04:22.102]  A hundred trillion dollars every decade to us, direct taxes.
[03:04:22.102 --> 03:04:25.364]  Let's do one more segment, come back and talk about what happened in Cyprus.
[03:04:25.364 --> 03:04:25.964]  You game to do that?
[03:04:25.964 --> 03:04:26.844]  Sure.
[03:04:26.844 --> 03:04:27.445]  Fantastic.
[03:04:27.445 --> 03:04:31.367]  I want to talk about what we've seen in Europe to understand what's coming for us down the road.
[03:04:31.367 --> 03:04:35.188]  We'll take a few calls for Naomi Prince here with us, Georgia, Connecticut and others.
[03:04:35.188 --> 03:04:37.029]  And then I've got other callers all over the map.
[03:04:37.029 --> 03:04:37.630]  I'll get to you.
[03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:38.690]  I promise to do it.
[03:04:38.690 --> 03:04:44.473]  We'll come back, answer that question, do one more segment with her in overdrive and she's going to be interviewed for Obama Deception.
[03:04:44.793 --> 03:04:47.139]  You won't see that until November.
[03:04:47.139 --> 03:04:49.424]  KnowMePrintz and KnowMePrintz.com is here.
[03:04:49.424 --> 03:04:52.411]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[03:04:52.411 --> 03:04:53.133]  Stay with us.
[03:04:53.133 --> 03:04:54.395]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.090 --> 03:05:02.511]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.511 --> 03:05:13.180]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.180 --> 03:05:17.263]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:17.623 --> 03:05:20.365]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:20.365 --> 03:05:31.654]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:31.654 --> 03:05:34.817]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.137 --> 03:05:41.281]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.281 --> 03:05:51.168]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.168 --> 03:05:52.669]  The war is here.
[03:05:52.669 --> 03:05:54.570]  It's an info war.
[03:05:54.570 --> 03:05:57.312]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:00.987 --> 03:06:05.769]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[03:06:05.769 --> 03:06:08.791]  I want you to know some very important information.
[03:06:08.791 --> 03:06:17.755]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[03:06:17.755 --> 03:06:22.678]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[03:08:02.324 --> 03:08:08.967]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:08.967 --> 03:08:11.929]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.508 --> 03:08:17.749]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live in Overdrive.
[03:08:17.749 --> 03:08:19.190]  Some stations carry it.
[03:08:19.190 --> 03:08:30.835]  If your local affiliate doesn't, you can just go to InfoWars.com forward slash show to find all the free iPhone, Droid app, the podcast, the free video feed, all of it right there at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:08:30.835 --> 03:08:36.597]  And please send that link on to your friends and family as well because that's how we reach more people.
[03:08:36.597 --> 03:08:39.739]  So many times folks say, I saw an InfoWars.com bumper sticker or
[03:08:40.499 --> 03:08:52.405]  My neighbor told me to tune into this local AM or FM affiliate, or somebody sent me the link to your podcast, or somebody sent me a link to the iTunes, or somebody sent me a link to their membership at PrisonPlanet.tv, and I logged on and used it.
[03:08:52.405 --> 03:08:53.226]  It's incredible.
[03:08:53.226 --> 03:08:54.266]  It woke me up.
[03:08:54.266 --> 03:08:57.608]  Every subject, every expert you can imagine.
[03:08:57.608 --> 03:09:06.833]  I forgot to plug in the last hour that we have a very special guest joining us tomorrow.
[03:09:06.833 --> 03:09:08.033]  For two hours, is it?
[03:09:08.033 --> 03:09:09.254]  This is going to be legendary?
[03:09:11.069 --> 03:09:16.154]  Well, he told me at least an hour, but it is nailed down for tomorrow.
[03:09:16.154 --> 03:09:20.398]  100% nailed down.
[03:09:20.398 --> 03:09:23.161]  100% nailed down.
[03:09:23.161 --> 03:09:26.004]  The fish is on the line, but not in the boat.
[03:09:26.004 --> 03:09:29.708]  Anyways, I need to stop right there.
[03:09:31.314 --> 03:09:33.716]  I act like Ted Knight from Caddyshack sometimes.
[03:09:33.716 --> 03:09:37.179]  Nomi Prenn's continuing here, getting into more serious issues.
[03:09:37.179 --> 03:09:39.080]  Cyprus and what we saw there.
[03:09:39.080 --> 03:09:41.102]  And now they're going, yeah, maybe we need bail-ins here.
[03:09:41.102 --> 03:09:44.124]  You know, direct tax for the bankers.
[03:09:44.124 --> 03:09:50.649]  And then Congress, QE3, $80-something billion a month, was $40 billion, then $85 billion, disappearing into a black hole.
[03:09:50.649 --> 03:09:52.531]  Congress says, where does it go?
[03:09:52.531 --> 03:09:56.394]  The Treasury says, just shut up, you know, and smacks him across the cheek.
[03:09:57.155 --> 03:09:58.698]  What is going on with Cyprus?
[03:09:58.698 --> 03:10:01.724]  What is going on with just grabbing people's bank accounts now?
[03:10:02.979 --> 03:10:13.885]  Um, the fact is that when, you know, there's so much speculation in a country and there's so much foreign capital going in that they want to basically try to take the money back from individuals who are on the ground.
[03:10:13.885 --> 03:10:19.367]  This goes to whether you're a small depositor or whether you're, in those situations, slightly larger depositors.
[03:10:19.367 --> 03:10:29.753]  And it's the kind of thing that if you have a very destabilized global financial system is a serious concern for whether it's the United States or whether it's Cyprus or anywhere else.
[03:10:29.753 --> 03:10:32.054]  And it goes back to what we were saying before, that as long as you have
[03:10:32.834 --> 03:10:33.655]  Accounts.
[03:10:33.655 --> 03:10:44.362]  Normal, regular, you know, money in banks that is co-mingled in an institution that can also go about and create all sorts of havoc and do all sorts of speculation and take on all sorts of risk.
[03:10:44.362 --> 03:10:52.847]  The money on the table is the easiest place to go, unless of course the Fed is funding you and then it's sort of a mutual situation and that's what, again, the Fed is doing as well.
[03:10:52.847 --> 03:10:56.750]  The Fed's balance sheet has grown by ten times since before
[03:10:57.290 --> 03:10:57.790]  I don't know.
[03:11:06.212 --> 03:11:07.292]  Buying debt.
[03:11:07.292 --> 03:11:08.493]  Treasury creates debt.
[03:11:08.493 --> 03:11:10.373]  The Fed takes it on their books.
[03:11:10.373 --> 03:11:14.255]  And more than 1.2 trillion dollars in mortgage-backed securities.
[03:11:14.255 --> 03:11:16.816]  A few years ago, they didn't have any.
[03:11:16.816 --> 03:11:20.817]  So they're basically continuing to subsidize the risk of the system.
[03:11:20.817 --> 03:11:24.118]  But the other place to go to get the risk... Is your bank account.
[03:11:24.118 --> 03:11:25.719]  Is the people's accounts.
[03:11:25.719 --> 03:11:29.740]  So it's really... What do you think of Corzine not getting in trouble from Global now, officially?
[03:11:30.305 --> 03:11:32.527]  Well, I knew that.
[03:11:32.527 --> 03:11:34.228]  But I mean, now, why not do it more?
[03:11:34.228 --> 03:11:34.769]  I mean, you know.
[03:11:34.769 --> 03:11:39.853]  Yeah, he's in this mutual reinforcement society.
[03:11:39.853 --> 03:11:44.197]  Is that how they'll destroy the Ponzi scheme, though, is they'll just go so far they destroy confidence?
[03:11:45.674 --> 03:12:02.019]  That can help because hopefully individuals will think twice before putting their money in something like MFGlobal and actually looking at what the alliances are, the people that run these funds and that run these investment management companies and everything else and be a little bit more prudent about their own money.
[03:12:02.019 --> 03:12:09.982]  But it does take people getting more knowledgeable about who's running what they have and where they're putting their investments and not going into something like a John Corzine MFGlobal.
[03:12:09.982 --> 03:12:13.563]  It took less than a year and a half for that guy to wreck that company.
[03:12:13.783 --> 03:12:17.247]  Well, he was making, what, 40-to-1 bets with other people's money.
[03:12:17.247 --> 03:12:19.590]  I mean, what a lunatic.
[03:12:19.590 --> 03:12:26.758]  But in the case of, like, Charles Talente, he'd been, you know, had a gold brokerage account that had a private account.
[03:12:26.758 --> 03:12:28.740]  It's like a bank account, for those that don't know.
[03:12:28.740 --> 03:12:30.442]  He'd had that for 30-plus years.
[03:12:31.343 --> 03:12:33.045]  He didn't even know six months before.
[03:12:33.045 --> 03:12:35.908]  Nobody told him that firm had been bought.
[03:12:35.908 --> 03:12:37.871]  So, I mean, how do you even... It's hard.
[03:12:37.871 --> 03:12:39.613]  It's like you have to be vigilant all the time.
[03:12:39.613 --> 03:12:41.274]  If it's yours, you have to be vigilant.
[03:12:41.274 --> 03:12:42.095]  Not that Celente isn't.
[03:12:42.095 --> 03:12:44.558]  I mean, he's a very intelligent man.
[03:12:44.558 --> 03:12:46.621]  But these things do happen in the night.
[03:12:46.621 --> 03:12:48.443]  You know, Chris Flowers, ex-Goldman person.
[03:12:48.923 --> 03:12:51.424]  You know, hires John Corzine, ex-Goldman person.
[03:12:51.424 --> 03:12:52.985]  You know, Corzine's bored.
[03:12:52.985 --> 03:13:01.868]  He's done for a while with public office and he goes in and he tanks this company and cordons off over a billion dollars in misappropriated funds to keep it going.
[03:13:01.868 --> 03:13:04.269]  I mean, had he kept... Was that really a theft though?
[03:13:04.269 --> 03:13:07.331]  Maybe he didn't make 40 to 1 bet by accident.
[03:13:07.331 --> 03:13:08.631]  Who was it transferred to?
[03:13:08.631 --> 03:13:09.551]  Maybe it was on purpose.
[03:13:09.551 --> 03:13:10.892]  Maybe it was a bank robbery.
[03:13:12.369 --> 03:13:33.370]  Well, some of it wound up getting returned, but what it was was him making a bet of some sort that was wrong on in order for him, like a gambling addict at Las Vegas, you're doubling down, you're doubling down, you're taking your grandma's money, you're taking your kid's money, and you're just trying to play and play and play until you hope you get out of it, and he couldn't get out of it.
[03:13:33.370 --> 03:13:34.831]  But because it wasn't his money,
[03:13:35.712 --> 03:13:43.842]  Because it was his client's money, in that respect, he was stealing from them in order to keep his... Why don't we give him a Peace Prize?
[03:13:43.842 --> 03:13:44.763]  Like Obama?
[03:13:44.763 --> 03:13:47.346]  Well, yeah, I mean, Bush was just given a Peace Award.
[03:13:47.346 --> 03:13:53.613]  I think we ought to give him a Good Spender Conscientious Financial Management Award.
[03:13:55.397 --> 03:13:57.218]  The press has been, you know... I better watch it.
[03:13:57.218 --> 03:13:59.299]  They may actually give him one, yeah.
[03:13:59.299 --> 03:14:01.100]  His friends have been on to say he did nothing wrong.
[03:14:01.100 --> 03:14:01.840]  He did nothing wrong.
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:02.681]  He did nothing wrong.
[03:14:02.681 --> 03:14:03.281]  So what?
[03:14:03.281 --> 03:14:07.823]  He made a bad bet and misappropriated... Because they all want to set the precedent to do whatever they want.
[03:14:07.823 --> 03:14:09.324]  They don't want to be looked at themselves.
[03:14:09.324 --> 03:14:16.287]  I mean, JPMorgan Chase had a lot of the trusts that were in charge of keeping that segregated money and they allowed it to be unsegregated.
[03:14:16.287 --> 03:14:17.688]  Here's what makes me maddest.
[03:14:18.868 --> 03:14:24.690]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, if you look, are the number one and number two biggest funders of shadow government.
[03:14:24.690 --> 03:14:25.811]  They fund the Bilderberg Group.
[03:14:25.811 --> 03:14:28.252]  They're on record.
[03:14:28.252 --> 03:14:29.852]  They fund its charity.
[03:14:29.852 --> 03:14:32.993]  They fund the carbon taxes.
[03:14:32.993 --> 03:14:37.975]  They fund making you live in a 200 square foot apartment to actuary the taxes.
[03:14:37.975 --> 03:14:39.416]  But then they're all exempt.
[03:14:39.416 --> 03:14:41.357]  They don't want just all the money.
[03:14:41.357 --> 03:14:42.877]  They want to wreck everybody else.
[03:14:42.877 --> 03:14:43.958]  These are real scum.
[03:14:43.958 --> 03:14:44.718]  They want the power.
[03:14:44.878 --> 03:14:46.239]  Yeah, and I hate their guts.
[03:14:46.239 --> 03:14:47.259]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[03:14:47.259 --> 03:14:48.940]  They need to all be locked up.
[03:14:48.940 --> 03:14:49.821]  I'll say that right now.
[03:14:49.821 --> 03:14:51.202]  They're the ones that run it.
[03:14:51.202 --> 03:14:52.722]  They're the ones that pull the triggers.
[03:14:52.722 --> 03:14:54.023]  They're the ones that push the buttons.
[03:14:54.023 --> 03:14:55.924]  They're the ones that run the wars.
[03:14:55.924 --> 03:14:58.425]  These are the bad guys.
[03:14:58.425 --> 03:15:02.108]  Yeah, and they control and they influence and they have that power.
[03:15:02.108 --> 03:15:09.832]  And they maintain it by their relationships with these institutions, with the federal government, with governments in other countries and so forth.
[03:15:09.832 --> 03:15:11.453]  They have the ability to manipulate
[03:15:12.389 --> 03:15:14.791]  The entire global financial and economic system.
[03:15:14.791 --> 03:15:17.113]  Well, people are always asking who's behind it, who's behind it.
[03:15:17.113 --> 03:15:18.174]  This is it.
[03:15:18.174 --> 03:15:21.598]  Every time I end up digging into the deep, he was rattle.
[03:15:21.598 --> 03:15:28.144]  No matter what it is, it's the big six megabanks and a bunch of degenerate royalty and just whose wealth is all...
[03:15:28.764 --> 03:15:29.144]  Tied up.
[03:15:29.144 --> 03:15:31.485]  Their wealth is partially in these banks.
[03:15:31.485 --> 03:15:32.445]  I mean, it is all connected.
[03:15:32.445 --> 03:15:35.566]  That's part of the reason I went and wrote the book that I'm currently revising right now.
[03:15:35.566 --> 03:15:36.746]  It'll be out next year.
[03:15:36.746 --> 03:15:37.606]  I want it to go back.
[03:15:37.606 --> 03:15:51.130]  I believe that it is the private bankers running the government to a large extent, or at least in alliance with the government making the bigger decisions and that they work together to decide how they're... And they're all a bunch of arrogant SOBs.
[03:15:51.610 --> 03:15:56.174]  And many of them went to the schools together, and again, Yadda2Go did everything together.
[03:15:56.174 --> 03:15:58.156]  They're from the same backgrounds.
[03:15:58.156 --> 03:16:01.639]  And they mutually enforce each other, and this has been happening... How arrogant!
[03:16:01.639 --> 03:16:07.865]  I mean, I see their arrogance on television and in their writings, but, you know, I'm doing God's work, you know, like Jamie Dimon said.
[03:16:07.865 --> 03:16:09.927]  How arrogant are they in person?
[03:16:09.927 --> 03:16:14.411]  I couldn't imagine being an evil jerk, and then no one can hold me accountable.
[03:16:15.412 --> 03:16:24.764]  The ones I know, the people I personally spend time with, like Lloyd Langfine in his office, they're just as arrogant in person as they come across on TV.
[03:16:24.764 --> 03:16:28.710]  If you watch them on TV and don't believe they're arrogant, you probably won't think they're arrogant in person.
[03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:29.731]  Tell a story.
[03:16:29.731 --> 03:16:30.412]  How are they in person?
[03:16:30.712 --> 03:16:31.413]  I don't know.
[03:16:49.068 --> 03:16:49.889]  A little higher than me.
[03:17:11.272 --> 03:17:14.034]  The person that he wanted to hear the information from.
[03:17:14.034 --> 03:17:15.975]  And that's just, that's how power happens.
[03:17:15.975 --> 03:17:17.276]  You reinforce each other.
[03:17:17.276 --> 03:17:28.725]  Whether it's a subordinate, whether it's a superior, you reinforce the story along the way and you shut down any dissent or conversation on any other side of that.
[03:17:28.725 --> 03:17:30.166]  And that's where your arrogance shows through.
[03:17:30.606 --> 03:17:33.548]  And then you act like you're doing one thing when you really know it's another.
[03:17:33.548 --> 03:17:35.349]  Everybody just plays dumb.
[03:17:35.349 --> 03:17:37.310]  Oh, gee, what are we doing?
[03:17:37.310 --> 03:17:39.050]  You don't look under the rock a lot, either.
[03:17:39.050 --> 03:17:40.271]  You feel you don't have to.
[03:17:40.271 --> 03:17:44.413]  If you're high enough up, if you're a blank penny or a dime, you don't know.
[03:17:44.413 --> 03:17:51.417]  You're not hanging out in Stockton with... No, no, you're like Hitler in the wolf's lair going, I can take down the Russians.
[03:17:51.417 --> 03:17:53.058]  You just don't care about it.
[03:17:53.058 --> 03:17:54.619]  Or Napoleon.
[03:17:54.619 --> 03:17:56.059]  Nobody can beat me.
[03:17:56.059 --> 03:17:58.661]  And it's been shown recently that they have been right.
[03:18:00.081 --> 03:18:09.927]  By the fact that the biggest bankers are still in charge of the biggest banks, which have grown... And so why shouldn't they start taking your private bank accounts?
[03:18:09.927 --> 03:18:11.647]  Why shouldn't they take your pension funds?
[03:18:11.647 --> 03:18:17.171]  When they take the cops' pension funds, the cops will just go beat our brains out that much harder to get more money.
[03:18:17.171 --> 03:18:18.431]  They'll probably thank them!
[03:18:18.431 --> 03:18:27.076]  Everybody's destabilized, which is why, at the very least, these institutions need to be made smaller, need to be broken up, so at the very least, our deposits, our money, isn't backing their risk.
[03:18:27.196 --> 03:18:29.338]  Real fast question from Georgia, Connecticut.
[03:18:29.338 --> 03:18:32.100]  George, what's your question for Naomi Prince?
[03:18:32.100 --> 03:18:48.253]  Naomi, I'm wondering if we could take back the money in some form of state banks or maybe re-take a new bank that basically from the Federal Reserve is their bank and produce the money only for Main Street.
[03:18:48.553 --> 03:18:51.394]  Now let's skip this network break, we're going to the bottom of the hour and that's it.
[03:18:51.394 --> 03:18:52.515]  That's a great question.
[03:18:52.515 --> 03:18:53.435]  What are solutions?
[03:18:53.435 --> 03:18:58.178]  State banks, I mean obviously we try to go to credit unions, they just shut those down.
[03:18:58.178 --> 03:18:59.939]  But I think we have to make those choices.
[03:18:59.939 --> 03:19:16.307]  Where we put money, before this big game of derivatives, before these banks were as big as they are, when they were just slightly smaller but equally as powerful in a sort of less dangerous financial world, they tried to take over the smaller banks and it's up to sort of individuals to decide where
[03:19:17.007 --> 03:19:17.647]  I think so.
[03:19:36.074 --> 03:19:36.615]  I don't know.
[03:19:56.107 --> 03:20:02.289]  Risky with people's funds because they don't have the big government banking and they aren't involved in the derivatives.
[03:20:02.289 --> 03:20:03.510]  Plus they're not as arrogant.
[03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:05.291]  They give you better interest rates, better service.
[03:20:05.291 --> 03:20:12.673]  They care about the local economy and about the state economy and that means that your bank account actually matters more to where you live as well.
[03:20:12.673 --> 03:20:17.435]  So again, I was talking about mutual enforcement at the big powerful level.
[03:20:17.435 --> 03:20:21.437]  This is kind of a mutual enforcement at the smaller more local and more state level.
[03:20:22.805 --> 03:20:23.305]  Absolutely.
[03:20:23.305 --> 03:20:28.289]  You know, I've had a bank account with one of the big banks since I was in high school.
[03:20:28.289 --> 03:20:30.110]  That's what my parents set up for me.
[03:20:30.110 --> 03:20:32.752]  Plus the idea is, well, if it's a bank all over, you can do stuff all over.
[03:20:32.752 --> 03:20:35.955]  But over the years, we brought that down to almost nothing.
[03:20:35.955 --> 03:20:42.799]  And then we just use it so when we go out of the country or something, you know, we have an international bank, but there's basically no money in there.
[03:20:42.799 --> 03:20:43.800]  Right.
[03:20:43.800 --> 03:20:45.581]  I have a mortgage at a big bank.
[03:20:45.581 --> 03:20:47.823]  I've had it for a long time.
[03:20:47.823 --> 03:20:49.404]  I admit it.
[03:20:49.404 --> 03:20:51.406]  But I don't really keep money there.
[03:20:52.148 --> 03:20:54.490]  Yeah, so it's not even like you have to do this right now.
[03:20:54.490 --> 03:21:00.514]  Just set up a new bank account, start putting your paycheck in the local bank, and just move away from the big guy.
[03:21:00.514 --> 03:21:01.695]  Exactly.
[03:21:01.695 --> 03:21:02.315]  It's incredible.
[03:21:02.315 --> 03:21:03.376]  Let's take another call.
[03:21:03.376 --> 03:21:04.417]  Lazarus in Florida.
[03:21:04.417 --> 03:21:05.898]  He's going to be on a different subject.
[03:21:05.898 --> 03:21:09.881]  Thanks for holding Lazarus, and then Ernest, and Mark in Scotland, and that'll be it.
[03:21:09.881 --> 03:21:10.181]  Go ahead.
[03:21:11.987 --> 03:21:14.048]  Uh, hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:21:14.048 --> 03:21:14.429]  Hey, bro.
[03:21:14.429 --> 03:21:23.254]  Um, I have information about the, uh, these, uh, secret, uh, imprisonment camps.
[03:21:23.254 --> 03:21:28.136]  Oh, you mean the Emergency Centers Establishment Act or the, uh, Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program?
[03:21:28.136 --> 03:21:30.518]  Because those are public.
[03:21:30.518 --> 03:21:33.239]  I was, uh, I was given five years.
[03:21:33.239 --> 03:21:39.623]  Uh, you know, I was young and I did stupid stuff and I was given a sentence of five years
[03:21:40.732 --> 03:21:42.463]  Uh, I ended up doing eight months.
[03:21:44.509 --> 03:21:46.610]  Uh, if I kept my mouth shut.
[03:21:46.610 --> 03:21:47.170]  Oh, wait a minute.
[03:21:47.170 --> 03:21:50.431]  So you were in the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp program?
[03:21:50.431 --> 03:21:53.912]  Because if you sign that, they usually cut it by two-thirds.
[03:21:53.912 --> 03:21:55.492]  Wow!
[03:21:55.492 --> 03:21:57.633]  I want to get your name and number and talk to you off air.
[03:21:57.633 --> 03:22:02.174]  For those that don't know, it was a secret program to prime the pump for concentration camps in America.
[03:22:02.174 --> 03:22:03.675]  You can look up in the 80s, it came out.
[03:22:03.675 --> 03:22:05.875]  It started under the Reagan administration.
[03:22:05.875 --> 03:22:07.876]  The Civilian Inmate Labor Camp program.
[03:22:07.876 --> 03:22:09.937]  Clinton hit it in plain view in 97, declassified it.
[03:22:11.417 --> 03:22:15.220]  But it's where the army runs it with state and federal prisoners.
[03:22:15.220 --> 03:22:17.141]  And these are real secret camps.
[03:22:17.141 --> 03:22:20.983]  But you go do work on them by waiving your rights.
[03:22:20.983 --> 03:22:26.247]  They almost use them like Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo where they actually create jihadi terrorists.
[03:22:26.247 --> 03:22:27.087]  It's the other way around.
[03:22:27.087 --> 03:22:33.492]  They actually bring in criminals or people in these camps to create clandestine operatives.
[03:22:33.492 --> 03:22:36.174]  This is a heavily classified area we're getting into right now.
[03:22:36.174 --> 03:22:37.474]  Sir, so hold on.
[03:22:37.474 --> 03:22:38.955]  What did you go to jail for?
[03:22:38.955 --> 03:22:41.157]  And tell us about the civilian inmate labor camp you were in.
[03:22:42.037 --> 03:22:47.718]  I was there, I was sentenced for Grand Theft Auto.
[03:22:47.718 --> 03:22:55.460]  And like I said, I'm not proud of that, but that's why I was put in there.
[03:22:55.460 --> 03:23:01.361]  They actually black bagged you to get you to this area.
[03:23:01.361 --> 03:23:07.583]  And I mean, I don't really want to say where the area was online, on the air.
[03:23:07.583 --> 03:23:09.523]  Well, we know where the 12 original camps are.
[03:23:10.455 --> 03:23:12.936]  Well, this one was in Florida, so I don't know.
[03:23:12.936 --> 03:23:16.178]  Yeah, no, it's listed.
[03:23:16.178 --> 03:23:17.158]  Okay.
[03:23:17.158 --> 03:23:21.900]  We've actually got it on screen for people, and they had it in plain view like it's no big deal.
[03:23:21.900 --> 03:23:22.841]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:23:22.841 --> 03:23:26.322]  Exactly.
[03:23:26.322 --> 03:23:27.543]  They gave me eight months.
[03:23:29.088 --> 03:23:30.269]  So you had to sign an agreement.
[03:23:30.269 --> 03:23:37.075]  See, what they're doing is to not make it completely illegal, you waive your rights under contract to go to a secret camp.
[03:23:37.075 --> 03:23:39.177]  And they put them on huge bases off on the corner.
[03:23:39.177 --> 03:23:42.820]  So, sir, describe what you did at this camp.
[03:23:42.820 --> 03:23:47.804]  Basically, meaningless labor.
[03:23:47.804 --> 03:23:51.067]  You know, they wouldn't give us weed whackers or anything.
[03:23:51.067 --> 03:23:53.029]  So, you know, just like in the... Yo-yos.
[03:23:55.737 --> 03:24:00.661]  Cool Hand Luke, you got these sling blades that you had to go out on the side of the road with.
[03:24:00.661 --> 03:24:03.003]  That's the yo-yo, yeah.
[03:24:03.003 --> 03:24:12.151]  And fight fires, they made us do, because it was a national state park that this was going on.
[03:24:12.151 --> 03:24:15.434]  And by the way, they told you it was secret, right?
[03:24:15.434 --> 03:24:22.920]  They told us it was secret and that it was a state-run fund, yet all the tags on all the vehicles were government.
[03:24:23.871 --> 03:24:25.436]  And let me expand on this.
[03:24:25.436 --> 03:24:28.908]  Did you go work for private firms?
[03:24:28.908 --> 03:24:29.490]  No, sir.
[03:24:29.490 --> 03:24:30.433]  Well, I don't know.
[03:24:31.448 --> 03:24:33.970]  Again, I wasn't privy to that information.
[03:24:55.742 --> 03:24:57.904]  I mean, folks, this government is so out of control.
[03:24:57.904 --> 03:25:01.226]  People even knew the stuff that was going on at these bases.
[03:25:01.226 --> 03:25:06.649]  So anything else you want to add about working at the... I don't know why you're... It's not even that big of a secret.
[03:25:06.649 --> 03:25:09.231]  I mean, most of it's public.
[03:25:09.231 --> 03:25:14.034]  What particular Florida National Park were you on?
[03:25:14.034 --> 03:25:16.615]  This was in Jonathan Dickinson State Park.
[03:25:16.615 --> 03:25:18.757]  Oh, State Park, yeah.
[03:25:18.757 --> 03:25:23.980]  And not only that, but there were also underground bunkers for
[03:25:25.049 --> 03:25:28.491]  Food, water, etc.
[03:25:28.491 --> 03:25:36.236]  throughout that park that there are people working at full-time and I'm talking full-time.
[03:25:55.555 --> 03:25:58.491]  You know, I got out easy on eight months and, uh...
[03:26:00.706 --> 03:26:10.032]  I thought it was a blessing until I, you know, started, until I woke up and realized that, you know, this is much bigger than myself.
[03:26:10.032 --> 03:26:12.413]  Now, I know, you're just priming the pump, and they admitted that.
[03:26:12.413 --> 03:26:16.215]  That came out in the Miami Herald, actually, in 1986.
[03:26:16.215 --> 03:26:19.157]  This was to condition the police and military.
[03:26:19.157 --> 03:26:19.977]  It was normal.
[03:26:19.977 --> 03:26:22.138]  See, it's all about brainwashing them.
[03:26:22.138 --> 03:26:24.520]  But now they're going, oh, by the way, now we're going to have political dissidence.
[03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:25.460]  We black bag here.
[03:26:25.460 --> 03:26:27.321]  Everybody's like, well, it's secret.
[03:26:27.321 --> 03:26:28.302]  They agree to be here.
[03:26:28.302 --> 03:26:28.722]  No, you don't.
[03:26:31.169 --> 03:26:31.869]  How are you doing, buddy?
[03:26:31.869 --> 03:26:33.390]  I've got two questions for you.
[03:26:56.607 --> 03:27:01.452]  I would like to know generally how much this affects the whole of the UK as well as America.
[03:27:01.452 --> 03:27:03.435]  You're under the exact same program.
[03:27:03.435 --> 03:27:10.002]  The programs are all identical with just simple name variations in some cases in the Anglo-American Empire.
[03:27:10.002 --> 03:27:14.507]  That means all former Commonwealth countries and the United States are under the same system.
[03:27:15.492 --> 03:27:18.994]  Yeah I gathered that, but we've not been having the drills like you guys.
[03:27:18.994 --> 03:27:27.558]  The second question we'll cover that is, I've been realising there's a lot of Islam being brought to the UK over the last year and a half now.
[03:27:27.558 --> 03:27:32.260]  I don't know if you've been reading the newspaper about the rugby and what not.
[03:27:33.755 --> 03:27:44.939]  Yeah, no, that's part of the clash of civilizations that PNAC wrote about, where they're going to only fund the radical Muslims, bring in as many as possible, and then basically let them do whatever they want while setting up Patsy's.
[03:27:44.939 --> 03:27:49.741]  It's all part of the clash of civilizations that PNAC wrote about, and I appreciate your call.
[03:27:49.741 --> 03:27:50.761]  That's a good way to end.
[03:27:50.761 --> 03:27:55.403]  What do you make of the open funding of radical extremists and Al Qaeda against Libya and Syria?
[03:27:57.663 --> 03:28:12.297]  Um, you know, it's not really my main topic, but I'll say that, going back to the banks and in those areas, that in a lot of the nations where there is the most clashes,
[03:28:13.117 --> 03:28:33.611]  They tend to be the areas that, and I just actually revised this chapter on the Cold War, the 1950s chapter, which is when a lot of these outposts actually happened, and when Chase in particular set up outposts in the Middle East, National City Bank, which is now Citigroup, a little bit less, and actually hightailed it to find places where they could create sort of financial service outposts
[03:28:33.911 --> 03:28:45.139]  Sure, they love to destroy... ...involved in what was happening on the government side and therefore support where they thought they could make the most profit, where they thought they would be most protected by both the U.S.
[03:28:45.139 --> 03:28:48.201]  government and whatever government was in power in any of the countries.
[03:28:48.201 --> 03:28:48.321]  Sure.
[03:28:48.321 --> 03:28:51.183]  And it's just kind of continued since then.
[03:28:51.183 --> 03:28:54.886]  Sure, bottom line, the people running our government love dictators and oppression.
[03:28:54.886 --> 03:28:56.928]  What do you think they want to do here in America?
[03:28:56.928 --> 03:29:02.512]  It doesn't matter what administration's in, they work for corporations that are totally cutthroat and criminal.
[03:29:03.252 --> 03:29:07.496]  And I don't know how it ends until we stand up and say we're not going to be slaves.
[03:29:07.496 --> 03:29:10.880]  But people think laying down is how you get through life.
[03:29:11.601 --> 03:29:26.951]  Yeah, I mean, coming from, I'm not a particularly violent person, but I certainly am someone who believes, and part of the reason why I started writing books after I left was to explain what I know of what's going on in my corner of it.
[03:29:26.951 --> 03:29:27.872]  To resist.
[03:29:27.872 --> 03:29:36.457]  To resist, to give information, to allow people to make their own decisions, and hopefully take it from there, because I believe that in order to be, if we're not informed, we can't resist.
[03:29:37.278 --> 03:29:37.498]  Absolutely.
[03:29:37.498 --> 03:29:40.181]  We're going to talk more about that in the Obama Deception 2.
[03:29:40.181 --> 03:29:43.404]  Nomi Prince, thank you so much for coming to Austin.
[03:29:43.404 --> 03:29:45.005]  We'll go into retransmission now.
[03:29:45.005 --> 03:29:46.666]  Nightly News, 7 o'clock tonight.
[03:29:46.666 --> 03:29:47.307]  Thank you.
[03:29:47.307 --> 03:29:50.210]  Thank you, Nomi.
[03:29:50.210 --> 03:29:51.611]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.611 --> 03:29:54.133]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.133 --> 03:29:56.816]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
