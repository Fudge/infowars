[00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:09.497]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:11.078]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.638]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:16.819]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:20.940]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.444 --> 00:00:38.648]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, the 17th day of October 2013.
[00:00:38.648 --> 00:00:51.839]  Top link, the top mega link at DrudgeReport.com, just above the fold, says Chase Fees on Cash Limits Withdrawals
[00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.214]  Bans International Wire Transfers.
[00:00:59.214 --> 00:01:10.584]  Again, if you go to DrugsReport.com and see the headline up there, Chase Fees on Cash Limits Withdrawals on Some Accounts.
[00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:16.830]  And this is the beginning of currency controls and so much more.
[00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:37.180]  We're going to be breaking this down today because it ties into a larger group of issues that really show us that we're in dire straits in this republic, but also worldwide and are under the clutches of the kleptocratic big six megabanks led by the ringleader.
[00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:49.573]  If the banking cartel could be likened to a satanic conspiracy in hell, JPMorgan Chase would be Satan, the devil, the old serpent himself.
[00:01:49.573 --> 00:01:57.217]  They are the kingpin, the leader, the master, the energy force in the entire system.
[00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:00.739]  They are the Sauron of Mordor.
[00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:06.062]  They are the all-seeing eye, lidless and wreathed in flame.
[00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.520]  Who are bringing in a global anti-human corporate world government.
[00:02:13.513 --> 00:02:24.995]  And we're going to be breaking it down and read my update to the Paul Joseph Watson article that DrudgeReport.com, the only news site in the country, yesterday, to link to our story.
[00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:31.876]  And today, it's German, British, Iranian, Japanese, Russian news covering it.
[00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:37.457]  As of an hour ago, and I checked this, we need to check again on Google News, no one in the U.S.
[00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:40.818]  dare talk about the Dark Lord, Sauron.
[00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:42.078]  No one dare talk about
[00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:44.574]  JPMorgan Chase.
[00:02:44.574 --> 00:02:49.756]  No one dare talk about the biggest private shareholder in the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:55.278]  No one talk about the hundred years, now coming up in December, that we've been under their control.
[00:02:55.278 --> 00:03:04.623]  That they've captured the country and have been converting us to a total tyranny while using our energy and our funds to build the planetary dictatorship.
[00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:11.326]  This is a big, big deal and I basically broke it down in an article update that I added to the top of Watson's article this morning.
[00:03:12.972 --> 00:03:14.454]  And we're going to read this when we come back.
[00:03:28.493 --> 00:03:29.934]  I tend to hang out with older people.
[00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:38.379]  I feel old, so my dad's not that old, but I just like hanging around with him and my mom, but also other folks.
[00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.040]  And so we went for a little jog.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.081]  I'm trying to get him in shape.
[00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:42.642]  I'm trying to get in shape.
[00:03:42.642 --> 00:03:46.544]  He was about 100 yards behind me and slowed down.
[00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:54.890]  And I jogged past a young family with a newborn little baby in a pack on the chest.
[00:03:56.164 --> 00:04:00.246]  of his father, and it reminded me of my children, in the little infant packs.
[00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:06.609]  And it was a little bitty tiny baby, just a few months old.
[00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:16.673]  And when I jogged past him, I thought, you know, usually you'd stop and give them a speech about vaccines, GMO, fluoride, but man, I'm late.
[00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:17.513]  I got out of here late.
[00:04:17.513 --> 00:04:19.334]  I got to get to work.
[00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:20.555]  I got a lot of stuff to get done.
[00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:27.097]  And so when I stopped and turned back around and came back past him, I stopped and I talked to him.
[00:04:29.918 --> 00:04:39.321]  And I had this thought after I got in the car later, that the thing I'm going to do is I'm going to start videotaping these encounters, just as an example of what to do with others.
[00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:40.121]  So you warn them.
[00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:41.661]  It's our responsibility to warn them.
[00:04:41.661 --> 00:04:57.846]  And the fact that people think it's weird you're warning them about vaccines, GMO and stuff, that'd be like saying in the 1960s, if you knew about putting syphilis in black people's vaccines, injecting them with syphilis, infecting them, if I knew and didn't go tell them, hey, don't go be part of that Tuskegee thing.
[00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:14.147]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.

[00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:12.076]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:13.937]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:38.950]  Others don't.

[00:06:57.461 --> 00:06:58.322]  Others don't.
[00:06:59.468 --> 00:07:03.753]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[00:07:03.753 --> 00:07:09.659]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere, and the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:15.465]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:18.989]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.

[00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:20.115]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:35.734]  My friends, we have another incredibly important worldwide broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:41.117]  Lennon LaRouche will be popping in to talk about geopolitical developments and inside information he's got.
[00:08:41.117 --> 00:08:49.703]  We're going to talk to three different members from pro-open carry Second Amendment groups that are the cutting edge of the real civil rights movement in this country.
[00:08:49.703 --> 00:08:50.123]  C.J.
[00:08:50.123 --> 00:08:57.748]  Grisham will pop in, Terry Holcomb, and many, many others are going to be popping in here on the broadcast today.
[00:08:58.851 --> 00:09:05.216]  We're going to have the folks on from Don'tComply.com as well, TexasCarry.org and others.
[00:09:05.216 --> 00:09:08.939]  And I'll be down at an open carry demonstration coming up 10 a.m.
[00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:17.366]  with the Texas Land Commissioner and others in San Antonio, Texas in front of the Alamo this coming Saturday 10 a.m.
[00:09:17.366 --> 00:09:20.548]  The police chief had said he was going to violate the law in the newspaper
[00:09:21.617 --> 00:09:27.099]  And arrest anybody that open carried a long rifle, which is totally legal in Texas and most other states.
[00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:30.480]  He's now backed off and says he'll allow it this one day.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.041]  And that was in the San Antonio Express News and a press release by the police department yesterday.
[00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:38.122]  And the police department said, we're all on the same time.
[00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:39.543]  It's not us against them.
[00:09:39.543 --> 00:09:48.285]  And that's because the union, and I've got this from inside sources, but the police have also spoken out, said we're not going to arrest people for having legal guns.
[00:09:48.285 --> 00:09:50.306]  So San Antonio Police Department,
[00:09:51.479 --> 00:09:54.460]  That's what the Civil Rights Movement's all about.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.641]  We're not going to arrest people if black folks go into lunch counters and eat.
[00:09:58.641 --> 00:09:59.762]  See, that's what you've got to do.
[00:09:59.762 --> 00:10:03.543]  Like Mahatma Gandhi, they said you couldn't gather your own salt.
[00:10:03.543 --> 00:10:09.565]  You had to buy it from the British East India Company in India, even though they had oceans surrounding half the country.
[00:10:09.565 --> 00:10:10.785]  And salt was very inexpensive.
[00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:16.687]  They would arrest you, years in prison, if you tried to gather your own salt from the ocean.
[00:10:16.687 --> 00:10:20.108]  So Mahatma Gandhi marched to the sea across the country
[00:10:20.888 --> 00:10:30.400]  And first hundreds, then thousands, then hundreds of thousands followed him to all break the law and sit at the front of the bus, eat at the lunch counter.
[00:10:32.984 --> 00:10:35.046]  That was the case here in the United States.
[00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:37.428]  But with him, go to the sea and gather the salt.
[00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:49.677]  Well, we are going to reclaim the Second Amendment and say, being a father, being a mother, being a Christian, being a libertarian, being a conservative, being an American, being a veteran is not a bad thing.
[00:10:49.677 --> 00:10:51.599]  In fact, it's a good thing.
[00:10:51.599 --> 00:10:54.401]  And you're not real liberals like Thomas Jefferson that are against it.
[00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:58.284]  You're authoritarians, and everybody's starting to see you for what you really are.
[00:11:00.444 --> 00:11:02.545]  That is what is coming up.
[00:11:02.545 --> 00:11:05.067]  Let me give you our top story.
[00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:15.654]  We broke this at InfoWars.com yesterday, and I saw the comments on some of the other news aggregating sites that aren't mainstream media.
[00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:18.055]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:23.299]  Well, when Paul Watson went with the article, he already had, I talked to him yesterday afternoon, more than 10 sources.
[00:11:24.535 --> 00:11:26.737]  This had been coming in for about four or five days.
[00:11:26.737 --> 00:11:27.817]  He didn't know what to make of it.
[00:11:27.817 --> 00:11:30.719]  It kind of got stuck in the pile of news coming in.
[00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:39.045]  He goes through all the whistleblower and tips that come in to the InfoWars emails, showtips at InfoWars.com and other emails like that.
[00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:40.506]  The rest of our crew does that.
[00:11:40.506 --> 00:11:51.093]  But after he had more than 10 of them in yesterday morning, he indeed made some phone calls and they said, yes, that's our policy, but that they couldn't comment on it.
[00:11:51.943 --> 00:12:04.515]  And then he went with the article that you saw up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com titled, Chase Bank Limits Withdrawals Bans International Wire Transfers.
[00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:07.458]  Now, DrudgeReport.com, the biggest news site in the world,
[00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:08.699]  It's
[00:12:24.807 --> 00:12:26.128]  You know, with their publishing company.
[00:12:26.128 --> 00:12:27.789]  He's got a pretty big company.
[00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.810]  He doesn't brag about it, but he's a pretty successful guy.
[00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.412]  He said, no, we got the letter and we've got a big business account.
[00:12:32.412 --> 00:12:34.333]  No more foreign wire transfers.
[00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:37.355]  And they basically have been telling people, just get a new account.
[00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:39.296]  We're not going to get, you know, do your business.
[00:12:39.296 --> 00:12:42.818]  I mean, that's what a lot of people are basically being told.
[00:12:42.818 --> 00:12:45.940]  And so it's completely confirmed this is going on.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:51.584]  I personally had my wife go into Chase yesterday and ask them some stuff and then
[00:12:53.215 --> 00:13:07.319]  I, on the way home, I had to leave early because of this, went to one of their centers and went in and said, I'd like to set up an account, but is it true that I can't do wire transfers and I can't have more than $50,000 of any type of cash business a month total?
[00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:08.579]  That's not just withdrawals, folks.
[00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:14.700]  I can't, say, run a restaurant and have $50,000 in cash deposits in a month.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.081]  They will shut down your account.
[00:13:17.034 --> 00:13:27.918]  And they said that subject to change, it may even end up being less per billing cycle or per statement cycle every month.
[00:13:27.918 --> 00:13:28.918]  So let's just be clear.
[00:13:28.918 --> 00:13:30.779]  Let's get the denial out of the way.
[00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:34.120]  Chase put out an official tweet and said this is their new policy.
[00:13:35.134 --> 00:13:37.176]  So this is real, this is going on.
[00:13:37.176 --> 00:13:39.177]  Now let's talk about what it signifies.
[00:13:39.177 --> 00:13:46.202]  DrudgeReport.com has since last night moved it from being a top story to the top story.
[00:13:46.202 --> 00:13:49.585]  The big link at DrudgeReport.com in case you want to find it.
[00:13:49.585 --> 00:13:56.370]  Chase fees on cash, limits withdrawals on some accounts.
[00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.513]  Now the French, the German, the British, the Irish, the Japanese,
[00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:13.851]  They're all reporting on this and freaking out, and saying capital controls, looks like Greece, looks like Spain, emergency, red alert, run around like a chicken with your head cut off, because that's what this signifies.
[00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:18.193]  Anyway you slice it, this goes from super horrible to absolutely dire.
[00:14:18.193 --> 00:14:25.336]  There, as of just a little while ago, there are no news articles in the United States about this.
[00:14:25.336 --> 00:14:30.378]  Just like Obama last week had a press conference, he's had several others, and no one will ask him
[00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:33.350]  About Obamacare not working.
[00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.930]  I mean, that's the first question.
[00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:40.152]  In a real press conference, even five, six years ago, everyone would be asking different angles of that.
[00:14:40.152 --> 00:14:41.873]  Guaranteed.
[00:14:41.873 --> 00:14:49.896]  Anybody who works in the media, or even citizens that follow news conferences, you know whatever the big issue is with the President, the White House, the economy, the government, the system.
[00:14:49.896 --> 00:14:51.956]  That's going to be nine out of ten questions.
[00:14:51.956 --> 00:14:55.818]  And after every angle's been hit, if they're still taking questions, they'll ask about some other stuff.
[00:14:57.066 --> 00:15:06.610]  No one at multiple press conferences, multiple, multiple, multiple press conferences has asked him about Obamacare.
[00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.371]  That's how controlled the press is.
[00:15:08.371 --> 00:15:12.513]  No one has asked him about a hundred plus days earlier this year.
[00:15:12.513 --> 00:15:22.618]  Drudge is pointing that out today, the mystery of a hundred plus days where the debt ceiling just stopped because they couldn't get it passed and didn't threaten everybody with, oh my gosh, we're going to lose our credit rating.
[00:15:23.695 --> 00:15:25.517]  Of course, the Chinese have now lowered the U.S.
[00:15:25.517 --> 00:15:27.520]  credit rating, and they're our quote, biggest creditor.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:42.998]  So they're already maneuvering us towards bankruptcy, and they're already teaching the sheeple that we're going to go totally bankrupt, not because they've maneuvered us into 600 plus trillion in fake derivatives that they've signed us onto, and have the country in 70 trillion in unfunded mandates, and 17 trillion
[00:15:45.188 --> 00:15:47.669]  Right now, currently, as actual debt do now.
[00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:49.790]  17 trillion do now.
[00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.211]  70 plus trillion in unfunded mandates, any way you cut it.
[00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:57.932]  And then 600 plus trill that we've been signed on to that's not our debt.
[00:15:57.932 --> 00:16:06.575]  But there's total economic ignorance in the general public so they can get away with this because of economic and geopolitical illiteracy.
[00:16:06.575 --> 00:16:07.556]  Illiteracy.
[00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:14.618]  Pygmies in the middle of Africa know more about government and banking, I guarantee you, than the average trendy.
[00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:25.813]  I'll guarantee you, if a pygmy was given a hundred gold coins and said, go deposit it in a bank, the pygmy would laugh at you and run and bury it under rocks.
[00:16:25.813 --> 00:16:34.096]  Guaranteed, the pygmy is a hundred times smarter, that's never even seen civilization, than the average trendy out there who does not know their head from a hole in the ground.
[00:16:34.096 --> 00:16:40.278]  Now here's the big top story, and let me read over this, so you understand the magnitude of what we're dealing with and why this is so important, alright?
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.560]  Update!
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.462]  Chase Bank Limits Cash Withdrawals Bans International Wire Transfers.
[00:16:47.462 --> 00:16:48.422]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:16:48.422 --> 00:16:50.683]  Update by Alex Jones.
[00:16:50.683 --> 00:16:58.985]  Alex Jones says, quote, the fact that these letters were being sent out to Chase customers was confirmed at the time that we published.
[00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:07.768]  But in the last 24 hours, we have confirmed that even large businesses doing international transactions have also received the same letters or similar letters.
[00:17:07.768 --> 00:17:10.129]  By the way, people with other banks are getting these now too, by the way.
[00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:10.829]  I haven't gotten to that yet.
[00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.691]  As I told you, Chase won't be doing this alone.
[00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:16.051]  You can assure yourself of that.
[00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:17.292]  Let me continue.
[00:17:17.292 --> 00:17:28.055]  I personally visited Chase Bank and inquired about setting up an account and asked if I could wire money out of the country or withdraw the amount of cash listed in the letter.
[00:17:28.055 --> 00:17:39.299]  I was told no and that I would have to qualify with them for a special type of international bank account and would have to deposit huge amounts of money and pay fees to be able to access those services.
[00:17:40.663 --> 00:17:46.646]  What this constitutes is a war on cash and a war on small businesses and individuals.
[00:17:46.646 --> 00:17:58.571]  Two years ago, we saw a giant backlash against Bank of America when they announced customers would be charged for using their own money via their debit card, $5 per transaction.
[00:17:58.571 --> 00:18:02.833]  We have crossed the Rubicon where now the currency has been devalued.
[00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:09.966]  So far, that you will have to pay money to have your money in a bank or use a debit card.
[00:18:09.966 --> 00:18:11.127]  It's like garbage now.
[00:18:11.127 --> 00:18:13.991]  The banks have unlimited fiat, so why do they want yours?
[00:18:13.991 --> 00:18:16.674]  They've already got the money with the QE Unlimited.
[00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:19.161]  You're going to pay taxes on later.
[00:18:19.161 --> 00:18:23.282]  They're going to gang rape you two ways, devaluing and making you pay it back to them because they got the money.
[00:18:23.282 --> 00:18:23.882]  How's that sound?
[00:18:23.882 --> 00:18:26.923]  By the way, Homeland Security is standing by with automatic weapons if you don't like it.
[00:18:26.923 --> 00:18:32.784]  Quote, Homeland Security is there to make sure this takeover happens, this criminal bank robbery of you, of your bank account.
[00:18:32.784 --> 00:18:43.165]  Continuing, in saying that international wire transfers are too much of a risk, Chase Bank might as well be bankrupt because it's telling you there is no money to withdraw.
[00:18:43.165 --> 00:18:45.726]  And they are a zombie bank, so they've been bankrupt for at least five years.
[00:18:46.994 --> 00:18:49.676]  This is where the mega banks have wanted to take us all along.
[00:18:49.676 --> 00:18:59.424]  A total cashless society that destroys all privacy and allows them to fine and fee the general population into serfdom, slavery, bondage.
[00:18:59.424 --> 00:19:04.588]  This is clearly a major step towards capital controls as we saw in the Cyprus bail-in.
[00:19:04.588 --> 00:19:13.356]  We are now receiving reports from business partners who we know well that they are being told by their banks that similar
[00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:19.170]  Regulations to those adopted by Chase are coming within the next few months.
[00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:26.693]  Chase would not be implementing a business killing strategy like this unless all other major banks were also planning to follow suit.
[00:19:26.693 --> 00:19:32.555]  What we see is mega banks leading the way to set the precedent that all the others will follow.
[00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:38.950]  Chase needs to issue a statement clarifying exactly why they are imposing these capital controls.
[00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:50.455]  It is clear that these regulations are being enacted for three different but equally plausible reasons, all of which contribute to the ultimate goal of sacrificing the global economy on the altar of derivative monster zombie banks.
[00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:54.977]  I will cover the three facts when we come back that you need to know.
[00:19:54.977 --> 00:19:57.479]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[00:22:14.394 --> 00:22:22.877]  These men say this secret underground video is bringing back the male performance and sensation they've been missing for years, and it's working better than pills.
[00:22:22.877 --> 00:22:24.458]  Things are so much better now.
[00:22:24.458 --> 00:22:26.879]  Everything kinda came back overnight.
[00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:29.340]  My girlfriend is very happy.

[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.985]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:23:04.985 --> 00:23:06.626]  What are bitcoins?
[00:23:06.626 --> 00:23:13.111]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:23:13.111 --> 00:23:14.933]  No bank needed.
[00:23:14.933 --> 00:23:20.637]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.

[00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:12.022]  I mean, not that honey, if it ain't free.
[00:24:12.022 --> 00:24:17.649]  Yeah, feelin' good was easy all along, when they sang the blues.
[00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:23.417]  You know, feelin' good was good enough for me.
[00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:25.719]  Good enough for me and my baby.
[00:24:32.518 --> 00:24:36.341]  Ladies and gentlemen, freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:49.430]  And when the bankers are done with it, you're going to have nothing left to lose, and they know you're going to physically fight back, and that's why they've got the biggest military the planet's ever seen geared up 24-7, trying to take on you and your family.
[00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:55.554]  And the military has woken up because of the training and the bad-mouthing of the Founding Fathers and any form of American liberty.
[00:24:56.581 --> 00:25:08.288]  But we have to support the military and other people in the criminal government with public support and speaking out so that they're not alone in refusing the illegal orders they're being given.
[00:25:08.288 --> 00:25:10.229]  You understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:25:10.229 --> 00:25:12.951]  The globalists want to impoverish you to control you.
[00:25:12.951 --> 00:25:21.436]  And now, if you just joined us, JPMorgan Chase has come out publicly.
[00:25:22.682 --> 00:25:30.864]  And said, hey, coming up starting in the middle of November, November 17th, for all these business accounts, you can't wire money, period.
[00:25:30.864 --> 00:25:32.644]  But you can have money wired in.
[00:25:32.644 --> 00:25:33.804]  That's a capital control.
[00:25:33.804 --> 00:25:49.447]  When a country starts going into hyperinflation, which they're set to do according to every yardstick, under QE Unlimited, and the new Fed chief says she's going to accelerate what Bernanke's done, she's the reported author of the helicopter bin strategy.
[00:25:51.021 --> 00:26:01.829]  And so the last thing they're going to want is for dollars to start going out of the country to be converted or people leaving the country with their money.
[00:26:01.829 --> 00:26:05.592]  The IRS has announced they don't care if Congress doesn't pass a law.
[00:26:05.592 --> 00:26:07.514]  They tried last year and this year.
[00:26:07.514 --> 00:26:12.478]  They're going to talk to Homeland Security about putting you on a list if they open an investigation on you.
[00:26:12.478 --> 00:26:16.761]  You can't leave the country even to go to Cancun for your honeymoon.
[00:26:16.761 --> 00:26:18.062]  This is what it is to live a slave.
[00:26:19.258 --> 00:26:20.339]  You want to live in North Korea?
[00:26:20.339 --> 00:26:20.699]  You are.
[00:26:20.699 --> 00:26:24.201]  I mean, it's known when countries do this, you're in deep trouble.
[00:26:24.201 --> 00:26:28.724]  Nobody does this, folks, but the most draconian places like North Korea.
[00:26:28.724 --> 00:26:31.786]  But in America, if it's a Democrat doing it, it's trendy.
[00:26:31.786 --> 00:26:37.610]  It's racist if you don't support North Korean-style currency controls, capital controls.
[00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.291]  Now, let's go over the three points.
[00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:45.235]  Chase needs to issue a statement clarifying exactly why they are imposing these capital controls.
[00:26:46.297 --> 00:26:58.944]  It's clear that these regulations are being enacted for three different but equally plausible reasons, all of which contribute to the ultimate goal of sacrificing the global economy on the altar of derivative monster zombie banks.
[00:26:58.944 --> 00:27:04.267]  Number one, capital controls to prevent money leaving the country as the U.S.
[00:27:04.267 --> 00:27:05.727]  dollar continues to devalue.
[00:27:05.727 --> 00:27:09.570]  Note that Chase will allow international wire transfers coming in.
[00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.431]  Roaches come in, they don't go out.
[00:27:11.431 --> 00:27:13.512]  But not going out of the accounts.
[00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:21.072]  Note that they only, that they are only concerned about risk when the money is being moved out of the account.
[00:27:21.072 --> 00:27:30.865]  Two, forcing businesses to abandon cash and switching everything over to digital currency that can be easily tracked, traced, controlled, and pilfered.
[00:27:30.865 --> 00:27:31.606]  Sucked off of.
[00:27:33.246 --> 00:27:35.129]  Security feed to death.
[00:27:35.129 --> 00:27:48.029]  Number three, part of the preparatory phase of the cyber-style bail-ins, or robbery of bank accounts, were the government announcing a new tax to gouge out a percentage of people's savings or have the country go bankrupt
[00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.011]  Under a debt limit increase.
[00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:54.992]  See, and now Obama says we can never question another debt limit increase before.
[00:27:54.992 --> 00:27:56.713]  That's financial terrorism.
[00:27:56.713 --> 00:28:02.135]  When they did it four months ago, and for a hundred plus days, the debt limit didn't go up.
[00:28:02.135 --> 00:28:08.177]  They just froze what they said the debt was when it was actually going up.
[00:28:08.177 --> 00:28:11.058]  So they decided this time to create all this hysteria.
[00:28:11.058 --> 00:28:13.519]  Now the Chinese communists have downgraded our credit.
[00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:21.228]  Now the whole world's making fun of us, like, aha, the people that didn't want to increase their debt, they're the ones that hurt America.
[00:28:21.228 --> 00:28:30.551]  Oh, America's bankrupt now, gonna be bankrupt soon, and in hyperinflation, because people didn't want to hyperinflate, and because people didn't want to increase the debt.
[00:28:30.551 --> 00:28:37.813]  That's like saying, he didn't want to, he told that person not to shoot themselves in the head with a .45, and then the person did it.
[00:28:37.813 --> 00:28:42.014]  That person's dead, aha, the person that warned them said it would kill them, they're discredited.
[00:28:42.915 --> 00:28:45.037]  Don't jump off that cliff, you may get hurt!
[00:28:45.037 --> 00:28:51.243]  You jump off, you break your legs, and then the person at the bottom goes, ah-ha, you told me I'd break my legs, you're discredited.
[00:28:51.243 --> 00:28:53.445]  That's how dumbed down the public is.
[00:28:53.445 --> 00:28:54.947]  What I just broke down to you.
[00:28:54.947 --> 00:28:59.551]  They have maneuvered us like every other country towards this, and now they're gonna hold us hostage like 2008.
[00:29:01.698 --> 00:29:05.160]  It's 2013, but it's going to become yearly, and then monthly.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.883]  Give us the water districts, give us the power plants, give us the roads.
[00:29:08.883 --> 00:29:12.825]  Go work every Saturday in a government work brigade, or it'll all go bankrupt.
[00:29:12.825 --> 00:29:14.086]  You're the faith and credit.
[00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:14.987]  This is your debt.
[00:29:14.987 --> 00:29:15.927]  You sign on to it.
[00:29:15.927 --> 00:29:17.008]  You do whatever we say.
[00:29:17.008 --> 00:29:22.051]  100% taxes on the middle class, or everything will go bankrupt.
[00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:23.712]  And the giant welfare class goes, do it!
[00:29:23.712 --> 00:29:28.195]  And France votes 100% tax on the middle class.
[00:29:28.195 --> 00:29:29.256]  The middle class folds.
[00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:46.892]  That's good, because the ultra-socialist commandos, all with billions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts, are even caught with the billions and are above the law, because they have French Homeland Security with weapons standing by to kill anybody that speaks out.
[00:29:46.892 --> 00:29:49.454]  We're going to be just like that.
[00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.855]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:53.377]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.377 --> 00:29:56.079]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:10.032 --> 00:30:16.418]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:30:16.818 --> 00:30:19.100]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.441]  They're the good guys.

[00:30:59.915 --> 00:31:05.717]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:31:05.717 --> 00:31:13.100]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.461]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:31:16.461 --> 00:31:18.202]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:31:18.482 --> 00:31:19.063]  We're good to go!

[00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:04.615]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:32:04.795 --> 00:32:13.461]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[00:32:13.461 --> 00:32:15.402]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:32:15.402 --> 00:32:17.043]  We are what we eat.
[00:32:17.043 --> 00:32:21.707]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:25.929]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:32:25.929 --> 00:32:28.191]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:32:28.491 --> 00:32:34.714]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:33:24.148 --> 00:33:28.151]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.151 --> 00:33:31.892]  There's other bizarre, crazy news up on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:31.892 --> 00:33:34.334]  And I say bizarre because that's the headline.
[00:33:34.334 --> 00:33:38.356]  Bizarre Freemason rant on House floor during debt ceiling vote.
[00:33:38.356 --> 00:33:40.077]  You are all sons of the devil.
[00:33:40.077 --> 00:33:41.478]  I don't really think it's bizarre.
[00:33:41.478 --> 00:33:42.418]  I think that's true.
[00:33:42.418 --> 00:33:43.599]  At least most of them.
[00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:45.720]  Sonographer shouts as she is dragged away.
[00:33:47.298 --> 00:33:49.559]  I don't know, I think working around all that evil would drive me pretty nuts.
[00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:50.919]  I'm just nuts watching it.
[00:33:50.919 --> 00:33:51.459]  Lockdown.
[00:33:51.459 --> 00:33:53.020]  Your cash is no longer your own.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.920]  Everything is fine.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.220]  That's another article.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:55.620]  Update.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:00.762]  Chase Bank limits cash withdrawals, bans international wire transfers.
[00:34:00.762 --> 00:34:07.084]  That is now the biggest alternative slash real news story in the country or in the world.
[00:34:07.084 --> 00:34:07.484]  Top.
[00:34:07.484 --> 00:34:09.425]  DrudgeLink at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:34:11.365 --> 00:34:11.806]  I don't know.
[00:34:32.962 --> 00:34:36.788]  What's really happening and how Americans have lost virtually all our constitutional rights.
[00:34:36.788 --> 00:34:38.951]  It's a good article showing how they've stolen them.
[00:34:38.951 --> 00:34:39.912]  But we haven't lost them.
[00:34:39.912 --> 00:34:41.093]  They're still inalienable.
[00:34:41.093 --> 00:34:42.075]  They're still there.
[00:34:42.075 --> 00:34:45.660]  We're just letting them tell us we're slaves.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.804]  So you have to stand up and rediscover them to reverse this.
[00:34:50.086 --> 00:34:51.647]  Here's what I want to say about this.
[00:34:51.647 --> 00:34:57.710]  You're going to see the same process we've seen just since I've been politically awake more than 20 years.
[00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.391]  I've seen in the news more than 100 countries.
[00:35:00.391 --> 00:35:02.492]  There's only about 190 countries.
[00:35:02.492 --> 00:35:04.593]  I've seen more than 100 of them.
[00:35:04.593 --> 00:35:07.535]  Sometimes multiple times in 20 years.
[00:35:07.535 --> 00:35:12.838]  Have this same thing done to them where foreign banks take over their government, leverage all this debt that's actually paid to them,
[00:35:13.919 --> 00:35:18.370]  You understand they usually pay the IMF World Bank money back to subsidiary private groups.
[00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.415]  And I've watched this over and over and over again.
[00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:27.874]  And then maneuver them into, okay, your debt limit's been reached, you know, go into deeper debt to us or we'll bankrupt everything.
[00:35:27.874 --> 00:35:29.755]  And then good people in the government fight it.
[00:35:29.755 --> 00:35:35.498]  The bankers pull back, control the press, lower their currency valuations, lower their credit ratings.
[00:35:35.498 --> 00:35:37.039]  There's a panic.
[00:35:37.039 --> 00:35:38.780]  Everybody goes, do what they say.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:48.666]  And then you get deeper into bondage until there's no electricity and running water and just armored compounds with military helicopters flying around and the money's transferred out of the country.
[00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:57.764]  And the globalists do that, they say, to take control of the world, to then bring in planetary government, to then bring in world population reduction.
[00:35:57.764 --> 00:36:03.653]  I was watching a clip just last night that Luke Radowsky shot a long time ago, a few years ago, of
[00:36:05.694 --> 00:36:06.254]  Ted Turner.
[00:36:06.254 --> 00:36:08.896]  And he goes, Ted Turner, you said we should reduce population by 90%.
[00:36:08.896 --> 00:36:10.597]  Do you still believe that?
[00:36:10.597 --> 00:36:15.761]  And Turner turns around, looks so evil with bodyguards, and goes, I think two billions more like it.
[00:36:15.761 --> 00:36:17.902]  And then pivots and walks off.
[00:36:17.902 --> 00:36:20.244]  And you can say, hey, there are too many people.
[00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:21.845]  You could argue that in some cases.
[00:36:21.845 --> 00:36:23.146]  There is dirty technologies.
[00:36:23.146 --> 00:36:24.106]  There are problems.
[00:36:24.106 --> 00:36:25.347]  We are hurting the earth.
[00:36:25.347 --> 00:36:35.314]  But do you understand, folks, that they're bringing out a covert program with bisphenol A, on record declassified as an anti-fertility estrogen system?
[00:36:36.315 --> 00:36:37.716]  That also increases cancers?
[00:36:37.716 --> 00:36:39.819]  That's Fox News AP Reuters now.
[00:36:39.819 --> 00:36:42.482]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[00:36:42.482 --> 00:36:45.145]  This is the reality of what we're talking about.
[00:36:45.145 --> 00:36:48.508]  So this is being done to all of us.
[00:36:48.508 --> 00:36:55.836]  So I just wanted to explain to everybody now that they're going to have the maneuvering of Obama, who just came out in a speech and said, don't listen to bloggers, don't listen to talk radio.
[00:36:56.584 --> 00:37:00.546]  They've openly authorized the Pentagon to engage in domestic lying operations.
[00:37:00.546 --> 00:37:02.827]  Now, that officially elapsed yesterday.
[00:37:02.827 --> 00:37:04.848]  That's now law that they lie to us.
[00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:08.089]  Law that they lie to us and engage in deception.
[00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:10.730]  And he says, don't listen to the real media.
[00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.391]  Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:37:12.391 --> 00:37:13.552]  Don't listen to Michael Savage.
[00:37:13.552 --> 00:37:14.852]  Don't listen to Matt Drudge.
[00:37:14.852 --> 00:37:18.174]  Don't listen to DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:18.174 --> 00:37:20.315]  Because it's not about left and right.
[00:37:20.315 --> 00:37:21.115]  It's not about liberal and...
[00:37:23.056 --> 00:37:27.138]  Democrats versus conservative Republicans, as Matt Drudge put in a tweet a few months ago.
[00:37:27.138 --> 00:37:29.398]  It's libertarian versus authoritarian.
[00:37:29.398 --> 00:37:35.041]  It's freedom lover, whether you see yourself as a liberal libertarian or conservative libertarian, whatever.
[00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:40.202]  That's the difference now, folks, and you better get it right now and come together.
[00:37:40.202 --> 00:37:46.605]  You better get that and come together that we have been overrun by foreign banks, that when they're in control of countries, they wreck them.
[00:37:46.605 --> 00:37:46.845]  Okay?
[00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:49.922]  And it's all happening now.
[00:37:49.922 --> 00:37:50.802]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[00:37:50.802 --> 00:37:54.824]  Government reopens after Congress in 16-day shutdown.
[00:37:54.824 --> 00:37:56.705]  Chinese agency downgrades U.S.
[00:37:56.705 --> 00:37:57.405]  credit rating.
[00:37:57.405 --> 00:37:59.126]  News of France.
[00:37:59.126 --> 00:38:00.906]  Surprises tucked in the Senate bill.
[00:38:00.906 --> 00:38:03.708]  All this pork barrel ripping us off.
[00:38:03.708 --> 00:38:06.309]  Biden offers federal workers handshakes, hugs and kisses.
[00:38:07.689 --> 00:38:10.111]  GM got bailout, now ships jobs to China.
[00:38:10.111 --> 00:38:11.492]  The examiner finally being covered.
[00:38:11.492 --> 00:38:12.953]  I've been telling you that for three years.
[00:38:12.953 --> 00:38:15.695]  Just now the factories are opening that they've been building.
[00:38:15.695 --> 00:38:17.016]  They got suicide nets, of course.
[00:38:17.016 --> 00:38:17.817]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:38:17.817 --> 00:38:19.218]  This is hell on earth.
[00:38:19.218 --> 00:38:26.544]  Oh, our government wants to pay to build factories with suicide nets and Foxconn, but they're liberal and want you to have free health care.
[00:38:26.544 --> 00:38:28.465]  Wake up, folks.
[00:38:28.465 --> 00:38:30.106]  Wake up.
[00:38:30.106 --> 00:38:30.827]  Wake up.
[00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:40.835]  Please, for heaven's sakes, they're now disguising manhole covers as giant wireless transformers frying people in New York.
[00:38:40.835 --> 00:38:42.175]  I mean, that's Wired Magazine.
[00:38:42.175 --> 00:38:45.337]  We are entering the twilight zone, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:45.337 --> 00:38:46.617]  Humanities in crisis.
[00:38:46.617 --> 00:38:52.720]  And the reason everybody's so on edge, freaking out everywhere, you'll notice it everywhere, is because people deep down know there's a crisis.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:58.863]  And the government-run media, the state-run media goes, oh, it's Al-Qaeda, oh, it's right-wingers, oh, it's patriots, oh, it's...
[00:38:59.483 --> 00:39:01.484]  It's, you know, it's anti-war people.
[00:39:01.484 --> 00:39:02.925]  It's anybody that doesn't, you know, that questions.
[00:39:02.925 --> 00:39:04.125]  They're the threat.
[00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:06.427]  Misdirecting your instinctive concern.
[00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:10.569]  No, the concern, the reason you're freaked out, is because the bad people are in control.
[00:39:10.569 --> 00:39:11.809]  They're the worst I've ever seen.
[00:39:11.809 --> 00:39:17.412]  Now, before we go to really big news and talk about how to take control of areas we can take control of.
[00:39:17.412 --> 00:39:20.554]  30 minutes to the next hour, then we got Lennon LaRouche joining us.
[00:39:21.374 --> 00:39:28.156]  And we've got a bunch of incredible civil rights activists joining us with Open Carry here in Texas and all over the country.
[00:39:28.156 --> 00:39:29.617]  Historic things happening.
[00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:30.297]  We're on the march.
[00:39:30.297 --> 00:39:32.778]  The empire's on the run.
[00:39:32.778 --> 00:39:36.899]  Before we go any further, I'm excited about freedom.
[00:39:36.899 --> 00:39:37.600]  I'm awake.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.800]  I'm upset.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.561]  And I want to just follow me here.
[00:39:40.561 --> 00:39:42.201]  It's one of the most important things I've ever talked about.
[00:39:42.201 --> 00:39:48.743]  I'm going to spend a few minutes and we're going to our in-studio guest.
[00:39:48.743 --> 00:39:50.104]  Who's driven here from South Texas.
[00:39:52.557 --> 00:40:05.043]  When I see a pregnant woman in a grocery store or on the street, or I see a woman with a newborn baby, and I generally, I always do it if they're with their husband because it might be creepy for a woman alone to have some guy come over and get in her business.
[00:40:05.043 --> 00:40:07.945]  But it doesn't matter, I still do it because it has to be done.
[00:40:07.945 --> 00:40:10.286]  But I especially do it 100% of the time if a man's with her.
[00:40:11.869 --> 00:40:18.711]  But I see them, I have a responsibility to warn them about the GMOs, the fluoride, what's in the vaccines on record, U.S.
[00:40:18.711 --> 00:40:25.313]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, where it says for experimental or law enforcement reasons, they can kill you in test.
[00:40:25.313 --> 00:40:27.554]  They say that's the law, I say that's a fraud.
[00:40:27.554 --> 00:40:30.715]  And all the history of secret experimentation.
[00:40:30.715 --> 00:40:34.336]  I have a responsibility, if I was in Alabama, they didn't learn about this until the 80s, it went on for 45 years.
[00:40:36.156 --> 00:40:49.500]  I was in Alabama when tens of thousands of black people came in for checkups, were told they were being given vaccines, and they were really being given a Pentagon-run program to give them syphilis, to spread syphilis amongst blacks, and to also test it.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.900]  Horrible, torturous deaths that took decades.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.121]  Spreading it to hundreds of thousands is estimated.
[00:40:55.121 --> 00:41:00.503]  Just like the declassification of HIV being put in the hepatitis shots for gay men in New York as a vector in the 70s.
[00:41:02.177 --> 00:41:08.398]  It was a Navy chemical, biological, weaponized cancer program under another name.
[00:41:08.398 --> 00:41:10.078]  We know it as HIV-AIDS today.
[00:41:10.078 --> 00:41:11.819]  That, by the way, is on record.
[00:41:11.819 --> 00:41:14.079]  The general public just hasn't researched it.
[00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:15.279]  So I know this type of stuff.
[00:41:15.279 --> 00:41:21.440]  I have a responsibility, because I know the major vaccines on record have cancer viruses, microplasms, all the additives.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.981]  The insert says it can kill you, give you cancer.
[00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:27.962]  Guillain-Barre's, neurological disorders, narcolepsy.
[00:41:27.962 --> 00:41:30.022]  I have a responsibility.
[00:41:30.022 --> 00:41:30.282]  Okay?
[00:41:31.394 --> 00:41:33.415]  To warn these people.
[00:41:33.415 --> 00:41:35.097]  And that's what my info war.
[00:41:35.097 --> 00:41:38.719]  So, my dad goes jogging with me this morning as I'm making him, trying to get him in shape.
[00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:40.540]  I'm trying to get in shape myself.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.241]  He's about 100 yards behind me.
[00:41:42.241 --> 00:41:44.803]  I walk by, jog by these people.
[00:41:44.803 --> 00:41:45.924]  They're walking by me.
[00:41:45.924 --> 00:41:51.768]  And I see the father and the mother with a little baby, almost newborn baby, in the little pack on his chest.
[00:41:53.004 --> 00:41:55.605]  And, uh, I noticed the guy kind of looks at me and looks concerned.
[00:41:55.605 --> 00:41:58.307]  I go, that guy recognizes me, probably isn't a fan.
[00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.768]  I could assess him instantly, run by.
[00:41:59.768 --> 00:42:02.029]  I think I'm not going to mess with him.
[00:42:02.029 --> 00:42:03.349]  I come back by later.
[00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:05.410]  They're, they're, they're walking back the other way.
[00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:08.372]  And I said, Hey, uh, nice baby.
[00:42:08.372 --> 00:42:09.412]  I got three kids myself.
[00:42:09.412 --> 00:42:11.654]  I kind of stopped and go, man, I'm trying to get back in shape.
[00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:12.234]  This is hard.
[00:42:12.234 --> 00:42:13.575]  I really am taking a breather.
[00:42:13.575 --> 00:42:15.435]  And they're kind of looking at me smiling.
[00:42:15.435 --> 00:42:16.076]  And I go, uh,
[00:42:17.059 --> 00:42:17.619]  You know, nice baby.
[00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:19.080]  And they're like, oh, thank you, blah, blah, blah.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.401]  And the guy goes, are you Alex Jones?
[00:42:20.401 --> 00:42:21.002]  And I said, yeah.
[00:42:21.002 --> 00:42:23.123]  And shook his hand, and she said her name.
[00:42:23.123 --> 00:42:28.747]  And his name is Ryan Crowley.
[00:42:28.747 --> 00:42:29.588]  We found his Facebook.
[00:42:29.588 --> 00:42:30.628]  And this is the guy.
[00:42:30.628 --> 00:42:31.949]  Just a couple hours ago, I was out there.
[00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:33.290]  There he is with his nice dogs.
[00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.893]  He's a PhD student in social studies at the University of Texas.
[00:42:37.893 --> 00:42:39.855]  He's a PhD candidate.
[00:42:39.855 --> 00:42:40.876]  I think he may already be a PhD.
[00:42:40.876 --> 00:42:42.597]  I didn't have time to do research on him.
[00:42:42.597 --> 00:42:45.599]  And I'm going to start, I didn't do this today, videotaping the people.
[00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:54.479]  And I'm going to start putting them on air so that it gets some attention so that they get warned and so other people learn how to warn people.
[00:42:54.479 --> 00:42:56.139]  I'm not going to just tell you about this now.
[00:42:56.139 --> 00:43:00.760]  I'm going to multitask and then reach hundreds of thousands or millions by shooting a video and talking about them.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.561]  And I talked to him for about two minutes.
[00:43:04.561 --> 00:43:07.382]  And I said, listen, I don't want to get in your business.
[00:43:07.382 --> 00:43:07.882]  But I said,
[00:43:09.321 --> 00:43:12.464]  Vaccine technology is 500 years old.
[00:43:12.464 --> 00:43:13.665]  The guy looked like he was a smart guy.
[00:43:13.665 --> 00:43:14.485]  I said, you probably know that.
[00:43:14.485 --> 00:43:15.546]  And she was nodding.
[00:43:15.546 --> 00:43:17.488]  And I said, I'm not even saying there isn't something to the science.
[00:43:17.488 --> 00:43:19.129]  It's that the history of testing.
[00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:20.050]  He started rolling his eyes.
[00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:21.111]  And I went, well, you know about that.
[00:43:21.111 --> 00:43:22.072]  He goes, that was a long time ago.
[00:43:23.203 --> 00:43:23.843]  I don't really know.
[00:43:23.843 --> 00:43:25.044]  It's a lot worse now.
[00:43:25.044 --> 00:43:26.545]  It's all currently going on.
[00:43:26.545 --> 00:43:31.289]  They just use things that are less aggressive that kill you down the road or lower IQ.
[00:43:31.289 --> 00:43:32.410]  And I said, look up U.S.
[00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:40.135]  Code Title 50 Chapter 32 on bans on human testing except for exemptions on law enforcement or research purposes.
[00:43:40.135 --> 00:43:46.580]  And then now she's smiling at me, almost laughing, almost thanking, almost saying, enjoy the rest of your run as I ran on up the hill.
[00:43:48.462 --> 00:43:50.463]  So I haven't had time to look at his PhD papers.
[00:43:50.463 --> 00:43:54.504]  I don't know his politics, but he looked almost amused, but also kind of freaked out.
[00:43:54.504 --> 00:43:55.965]  And I said, listen, I care about your baby.
[00:43:55.965 --> 00:43:57.105]  I have responsibility.
[00:43:57.105 --> 00:44:08.769]  And I said, just like if it was Tuskegee, and I would have known in the 60s, decades before it came out, if I saw black folks walking into the clinic, I would be out there saying they're going to inject you with syphilis.
[00:44:08.769 --> 00:44:14.111]  And I said, just because, and I can tell you, you're probably in the system somehow by the way you're looking at me.
[00:44:14.111 --> 00:44:16.232]  The guy's going to listen and hear this and go, wow, this guy really did read me.
[00:44:17.356 --> 00:44:20.157]  I thought he was probably a cop or military or something.
[00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:23.637]  I could tell he was establishment, but no, he's gonna be an academic.
[00:44:23.637 --> 00:44:27.078]  Because there was kind of a smiling, like laughing, and I went, listen, I just care about your kid.
[00:44:27.078 --> 00:44:28.298]  You've been warned.
[00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:29.638]  And I turned and walked off.
[00:44:29.638 --> 00:44:31.418]  And people could say, man, that's really weird to do that.
[00:44:31.418 --> 00:44:32.739]  No, it's not!
[00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:38.140]  If I knew black people were being injected with syphilis, and I use that example, because people seem to only know about that.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.000]  Folks, they did it to poor Appalachians.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.080]  They did it to Guatemalans.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.120]  They're still doing it.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.541]  They just gave hundreds of thousands of people in Africa and India
[00:44:46.041 --> 00:44:50.829]  Polio with the polio vaccine on record and it was a footnote in the paper.
[00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:54.474]  66,000 kids got paralyzed in one round of shots in India alone.
[00:44:56.547 --> 00:44:57.828]  Bill Gates Foundation.
[00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:58.169]  Okay?
[00:44:58.169 --> 00:45:00.250]  I mean, I have a responsibility.
[00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.532]  This isn't a game.
[00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:06.316]  And I get why the people want to laugh, because if you don't laugh, you've got to admit it's true and then do something.
[00:45:06.316 --> 00:45:08.078]  So he's probably a great guy.
[00:45:08.078 --> 00:45:10.560]  My point is, is that he told me his name.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.261]  I went and looked him up.
[00:45:11.261 --> 00:45:12.042]  He's a public figure.
[00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:13.083]  Got a Facebook.
[00:45:13.083 --> 00:45:15.345]  I'm here talking about him and his wife.
[00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:15.985]  I love you.
[00:45:16.946 --> 00:45:18.268]  I want humanity to survive.
[00:45:18.268 --> 00:45:19.929]  I don't want to be under eugenics.
[00:45:19.929 --> 00:45:25.595]  I love everybody, and I'm here doing this so you hear about it, so you really research U.S.
[00:45:25.595 --> 00:45:27.738]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B.
[00:45:31.004 --> 00:45:38.246]  Which says we ban secret testing unless it's authorized for law enforcement purposes or research purposes.
[00:45:38.246 --> 00:45:40.027]  So I'm done talking about that.
[00:45:40.027 --> 00:45:44.448]  And they've got other codes and they change it one year and change it back the next and there's a bunch of versions.
[00:45:44.448 --> 00:45:46.469]  The point is everybody knows about secret testing.
[00:45:46.469 --> 00:45:48.350]  Everybody knows the IQ is lowering.
[00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:51.411]  Everybody knows bisphenol A reduces fertility.
[00:45:51.411 --> 00:45:52.271]  Everybody knows this.
[00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:58.013]  Now, we're joined by a guy that I've got to say, as for medical guest, health guest, nutrition guest,
[00:45:59.153 --> 00:46:01.296]  Is the most popular we've ever had.
[00:46:01.296 --> 00:46:03.799]  Hands down, Dr. Ed Group.
[00:46:03.799 --> 00:46:06.163]  And I'm not going to go over his whole giant bio.
[00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.045]  You can go to his website and look at that.
[00:46:08.925 --> 00:46:30.634]  But it's a huge... He's a diplomat of the American Clinical Board of Nutrition, doctor of chiropractic, diplomat of the American Board of Functional Medicine, diplomat of the Chiropractic Board of Clinical Nutrition, a naturopathic physician, certified clinical nutritionist, holistic health practitioner, certified clinical herbalist, and one of the big formulators in the country.
[00:46:30.634 --> 00:46:32.855]  Like, now that I really know who he is, he's like the name in it.
[00:46:32.855 --> 00:46:33.935]  That's why I've said who's the best.
[00:46:33.935 --> 00:46:35.156]  Everybody told me this guy, so I got him.
[00:46:35.376 --> 00:46:36.378]  He lives here in Texas.
[00:46:36.378 --> 00:46:39.002]  Alternative medicine practitioner and a lot more.
[00:46:39.002 --> 00:46:42.868]  And he heads up his big different centers and things.
[00:46:42.868 --> 00:46:43.889]  We're going to tell you about that.
[00:46:43.889 --> 00:46:46.213]  But the reason I got him back and he's here with us till the bottom.
[00:46:47.259 --> 00:46:47.599]  Of course.
[00:47:11.042 --> 00:47:21.266]  And we wanted to get him back on to talk about nascent iodine and other things that go with it that are so important and why people are really blown away by it and what it does as a shield against fluoride and other things.
[00:47:21.266 --> 00:47:22.706]  But you just heard my whole rant.
[00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:24.027]  We're going to break in a moment, Dr. Grippin.
[00:47:24.027 --> 00:47:25.067]  I appreciate you being here.
[00:47:25.067 --> 00:47:27.748]  We're also going to tape and interview the lawyer next week for the Nightly News.
[00:47:28.956 --> 00:47:30.758]  But you just heard what I said.
[00:47:30.758 --> 00:47:47.272]  Do you think it's extreme or bad to warn people when you know the vaccine insert says there's a chance it could kill your child or hurt them, and they lie at the hospital and tell you that it's safe and effective, no side effects, when even the drug ads on TV have to admit what it can do to you?
[00:47:47.272 --> 00:47:50.595]  With vaccines, they don't do that because they're the worst.
[00:47:50.595 --> 00:47:51.696]  Do you think I'm wrong?
[00:47:51.696 --> 00:47:52.917]  Should I not warn these people?
[00:47:54.133 --> 00:47:55.774]  I think you should warn everybody.
[00:47:55.774 --> 00:47:56.754]  I warn people too.
[00:47:56.754 --> 00:48:04.837]  I remember when my wife was pregnant and we went to the gynecologist's office, which I didn't even really want to go, but she wanted to do some tests just to make sure everything was okay.
[00:48:04.837 --> 00:48:11.359]  And there was a big sign on the door that said, don't forget to get your vaccine today for pregnant women.
[00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:12.339]  And I was in shock.
[00:48:12.339 --> 00:48:16.981]  And there was some people sitting in the office and I was like, listen, do not get a vaccine.
[00:48:16.981 --> 00:48:18.102]  This is what can happen to you.
[00:48:19.842 --> 00:48:39.703]  And it's amazing that we are literally living in a chemical matrix because what led me to the root cause of diseases, I wasn't even taught that in all the schooling that I went through, and medical doctors aren't even taught what the root cause of disease is, and they don't want to teach them that because even natural schools will teach you to prescribe a natural herb for something.
[00:48:40.163 --> 00:48:45.046]  I went on a mission like you for 10 years to try to figure out what's causing all these problems.
[00:48:45.046 --> 00:48:48.769]  What's the main reason we have all these chemicals in the environment?
[00:48:48.769 --> 00:48:53.933]  Looking at the air, looking at the water quality, looking at the food people are putting in their system.
[00:48:53.933 --> 00:48:59.777]  And then realize that all disease, I traced it all back and even looked at Russian and German research.
[00:49:00.277 --> 00:49:12.267]  Basically, all the chemical stew that you're bringing into your body on a daily basis overloads your system and you're not able to get it out fast enough and that is a direct link to all disease.
[00:49:12.267 --> 00:49:19.614]  And what we figured out was the most important part of the body, which is never taught in medical school, is how important the intestines are.
[00:49:19.614 --> 00:49:25.278]  Because when you look and you get a list of a million different chemicals and toxins that are entering the system on a daily basis,
[00:49:25.979 --> 00:49:30.745]  Well, where are those and how are those toxins coming into the body?
[00:49:30.745 --> 00:49:33.408]  Most of them are all coming in through the intestines.
[00:49:33.408 --> 00:49:36.432]  And that's why people have such bad intestinal problems.
[00:49:36.432 --> 00:49:42.961]  That's why they have leaky gut, the GMOs with the BT toxin, burning holes through the intestinal lining, and all those toxins.
[00:49:45.123 --> 00:49:45.784]  Absolutely.
[00:49:45.784 --> 00:49:46.825]  It blows up their stomach.
[00:49:46.825 --> 00:49:48.026]  I mean the BT toxin.
[00:49:48.026 --> 00:49:58.955]  So what happens is you have an excess of toxins coming in and not, you know, not even to mention all the anti-fertility stuff that's out there, the thyroid disruption, the lack of iodine.
[00:49:58.955 --> 00:50:02.939]  And by the way, in even mainline medical doctor science, as you know, until about 10 years ago,
[00:50:03.539 --> 00:50:10.529]  They said never take a vaccine when you're pregnant because it's known to lead to miscarriage, autism, so many neurological problems.
[00:50:10.529 --> 00:50:12.191]  That is mainline medical science.
[00:50:12.191 --> 00:50:16.557]  Any doctor who was trained before 10 years ago will say, you know, we were taught that, we know that.
[00:50:16.557 --> 00:50:18.480]  Now it's like, no, you need extra when you're pregnant.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.322]  And now look at all the drugstores everywhere.
[00:50:21.322 --> 00:50:25.907]  You go to a drugstore and you get 5% off your bill if you get a vaccination.
[00:50:25.907 --> 00:50:27.909]  You get flu shots now.
[00:50:27.909 --> 00:50:29.830]  They're promoting flu shots for pregnant women.
[00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:37.558]  So it's a conglomerate of all these toxins that are being pushed upon us to create disease, to put money back into the mainstream.
[00:50:37.898 --> 00:50:45.126]  It is a mainlining of secret testing bioweapon programs under the eugenics program carried out in Germany, England, the United States.
[00:50:45.126 --> 00:50:47.488]  The United States, with England, created eugenics.
[00:50:47.488 --> 00:50:49.410]  They created Adolf Hitler on record.
[00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:51.452]  And I told this PhD guy that.
[00:50:51.452 --> 00:50:52.233]  And I said, you know that.

[00:54:18.298 --> 00:54:23.703]  GlobalHealingCenter.com is the amazing website of Dr. Ed Group.
[00:54:23.703 --> 00:54:31.469]  You can find the nascent iodine that everybody has tried out here in the office versus the other leading competitors.
[00:54:31.469 --> 00:54:34.251]  And I didn't start selling this going after the leading competitors.
[00:54:34.251 --> 00:54:35.472]  I'm not.
[00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:37.934]  Leading competitors like eat the stopper out of the top.
[00:54:37.934 --> 00:54:39.295]  I can't even take it.
[00:54:39.295 --> 00:54:42.177]  It's the most nasty stuff I've ever tasted and they say that's nascent iodine.
[00:54:43.118 --> 00:54:48.080]  And a group such a nice guy is like, well, I don't want to say anything, but really that stuff breaks down and alcohol and other stuff.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.440]  It's not really nascent anymore.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.201]  And I want you to speak about that.
[00:54:51.201 --> 00:55:00.304]  We're going to get into BPA and the new study out and what that's doing to the chromosomes and why the babies are having the autism and the deformity and the rest of it.
[00:55:01.127 --> 00:55:13.077]  We start the next hour, but this is sold out, and the factory, it's been around 40 years, the organic factory that he exclusively uses, is making more exclusively for us right now.
[00:55:13.077 --> 00:55:15.038]  It's back-ordered about three weeks, just to be safe.
[00:55:15.038 --> 00:55:18.922]  It should be in about two weeks, and then a week to get it shipped out to you, but everybody's already ordered.
[00:55:18.922 --> 00:55:28.590]  It's either been shipped or is being shipped in the next few days, but if you want to get in line to get the Survival Shield Nascent Iodine Dietary Supplement from InfoWars Life, it's called Survival Shield,
[00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:34.055]  Then you go to Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.

[00:55:41.022 --> 00:55:41.943]  It's a win-win-win.
[00:55:41.943 --> 00:55:48.870]  Dr. Group, we're going to get into the whole bisphenol A and other toxins that have to be avoided and more when we start the next hour.
[00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:51.813]  But briefly, going out to break, here starting the next hour.
[00:55:53.595 --> 00:56:00.118]  You were getting into this total assault and why they want to make us sick for the medical model, this medical tyranny.
[00:56:00.118 --> 00:56:04.561]  In Nazi Germany, in Soviet Russia, the medical system was the tyranny.
[00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:07.843]  Because the tyrants found guys in white lab coats and get away with anything.
[00:56:09.104 --> 00:56:10.105]  Well, that's the whole thing.
[00:56:10.105 --> 00:56:17.870]  I mean, if a whole population is constantly sick, I mean, you can walk up to anybody on the streets right now and say, do you feel healthy?
[00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:18.330]  Do you feel 100%?
[00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:20.392]  I mean, you're not going to find anybody.
[00:56:20.392 --> 00:56:24.634]  I mean, even children, they're starting now when women are pregnant.
[00:56:24.634 --> 00:56:26.316]  They're starting before women are pregnant.
[00:56:26.316 --> 00:56:28.877]  They're trying to prevent them from getting pregnant.
[00:56:28.877 --> 00:56:29.258]  I mean, it's
[00:56:30.018 --> 00:56:44.024]  Even if a young child is born, they're finding all kinds of chemicals in the breast milk right now, that from the time the child is born, they're fed not breast milk, what they should be fed in most cases, but they're on soy formulas, GMO stuff.
[00:56:44.024 --> 00:56:47.686]  I mean, the kid is now sick from an early age.
[00:56:47.686 --> 00:56:48.867]  The mothers are sick.
[00:56:48.867 --> 00:56:53.909]  I mean, people, everybody out there suffers from at least one, two, three, four, five different
[00:56:54.369 --> 00:57:07.079]  Negative health conditions, and it says really the solution is as easy as we know and we've been talking about it for years How many chemicals and how many toxins and all this stuff that we're bombarded with on a daily basis?
[00:57:07.079 --> 00:57:10.401]  Everybody has to cleanse their body on a regular basis.
[00:57:10.401 --> 00:57:11.963]  They have a shower.
[00:57:11.963 --> 00:57:18.107]  They take a shower They wash their skin, but they don't clean the inside of their system and the big secret that we found was
[00:57:19.048 --> 00:57:35.693]  If you have a million toxins coming into your body on a daily basis and you're only able to get rid of, let's say, 500,000 toxins on a daily basis, you still have 500,000 toxins that your body has to keep and store somewhere in its system.
[00:57:35.693 --> 00:57:39.594]  And how do we normally, naturally get rid of toxins?
[00:57:39.594 --> 00:57:40.994]  Well, through exercise.
[00:57:40.994 --> 00:57:42.955]  We have respiration, sweating.
[00:57:43.939 --> 00:57:50.062]  We have urination, we have defecation, and women have five elimination routes because they have their menstrual cycles.
[00:57:50.062 --> 00:57:51.823]  We also have abomination.
[00:57:51.823 --> 00:57:57.225]  Yeah, that's a whole other subject right there, which is going to even cause more damage to the health care system.
[00:57:57.225 --> 00:57:59.046]  We have chemtralination, but go ahead.
[00:57:59.046 --> 00:58:10.412]  We have chemtralination, and we have the fact that we have a declining health care system that's a serious, serious problem, and we need people to stand up and take responsibility for their own health, really, because
[00:58:11.152 --> 00:58:18.994]  You know how much we can save and how we can attack this whole system is just preventing ingestion of all the things that cause disease.
[00:58:18.994 --> 00:58:30.417]  Just if you take away 90% of the things that, uh, toxins that people are putting into their system on a daily basis, you can reduce doctor's visits, you can reduce prescription medication.
[00:58:30.417 --> 00:58:31.258]  You're right, stay there.
[00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:38.680]  I mean, I saw a Washington Post article a few months ago where they have to plant crops for the bees that aren't for humans just so all the bees don't die.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.560]  That's how toxic it is.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:47.686]  Yeah, that's right, but they're not... This is GCN, the Genesis... We'll be back, folks, with Dr. Ed Gribb's second hour coming up.
[00:58:50.871 --> 00:58:56.352]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:58:56.352 --> 00:59:05.235]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:59:05.235 --> 00:59:13.057]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:59:13.057 --> 00:59:20.459]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:55.733]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.733 --> 01:00:05.060]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.361]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.361 --> 01:00:08.142]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.142 --> 01:00:09.903]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.903 --> 01:00:11.484]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.484 --> 01:00:13.406]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.406 --> 01:00:17.209]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.209 --> 01:00:21.292]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.045 --> 01:00:28.429]  Well, if you just joined us, JPMorgan Chase says they don't need your business.
[01:00:28.429 --> 01:00:29.710]  They've got the Federal Reserve.
[01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.171]  They've got tens of trillions of bank or bailout money.
[01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:34.633]  They're going to basically charge you to deposit cash with them.
[01:00:34.633 --> 01:00:38.376]  Won't let you make any foreign transfers of money, but money can come in.
[01:00:38.376 --> 01:00:39.878]  Sounds like capital controls to me.
[01:00:39.878 --> 01:00:42.920]  The story's top story on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.261]  Dr. Ed Gribbs with us.
[01:00:44.261 --> 01:00:46.343]  Another 30 minutes, then Lyndon LaRouge is going to pop in.
[01:00:47.398 --> 01:00:47.918]  We're good to go.
[01:01:08.652 --> 01:01:14.356]  Well, what we found was that your intestines and your intestinal tract really is the main focus point.
[01:01:14.356 --> 01:01:20.521]  So if you keep that clean on a regular basis using like a really good oxygen-based cleanser, you can prevent.
[01:01:20.521 --> 01:01:26.405]  It's all about preventing and addressing the root cause of disease instead of addressing the symptoms of disease.
[01:01:26.405 --> 01:01:31.829]  We know all the chemicals are going to come in, they're going to get leaked through, they're going to cause damage to all the organs, they're going to dumb you down.
[01:01:32.529 --> 01:01:34.450]  But what can people do about that?
[01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:35.451]  I mean, that's the main thing.
[01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:36.612]  People want solutions.
[01:01:36.612 --> 01:01:47.380]  The best thing you can do is reopen your elimination routes, which means exercising, breathing better, sweating more, and then eliminating the toxins that could be coming into your system and cleansing.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:50.422]  Like, just imagine if you were to take something
[01:01:51.062 --> 01:02:07.783]  Every single meal that someone would eat and put it in a big trash can, I mean they're going to have a breakfast meal with a big 42 ounce coke, they're going to have a lunch meal which is probably going to be a big meat, potatoes, all kinds of stuff, GMO, dinner, wine, dessert, mix all that up in a big trash can and pour it over the top of your system.
[01:02:08.504 --> 01:02:11.046]  And then never take a shower for two or three days.
[01:02:11.046 --> 01:02:13.327]  Well, I tell you, most people are constipated.
[01:02:13.327 --> 01:02:17.229]  They're not going to the bathroom two or three times a day, so all that stuff is going and sitting.
[01:02:17.229 --> 01:02:21.392]  It's a miracle we're even... I mean, no wonder we have the highest cancer rate in the world.
[01:02:21.392 --> 01:02:22.893]  No wonder our IQ is dropping.
[01:02:22.893 --> 01:02:23.693]  You know the studies?
[01:02:23.693 --> 01:02:24.494]  Guys, pull that up.
[01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:26.635]  US IQ lowest in the world.
[01:02:26.635 --> 01:02:27.916]  England trails us.
[01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:30.117]  It's not just that we're dumbed down in the school.
[01:02:30.117 --> 01:02:31.098]  We are physically
[01:02:31.658 --> 01:02:32.438]  Brain damaged.
[01:02:32.438 --> 01:02:43.663]  Right, because when you put all that stuff inside the system, if you take the intestines out and cut them open, it's going to be about 35 feet, 35 square feet or the size of a tennis court is the surface area.
[01:02:43.663 --> 01:02:51.466]  So if you have all that and you're not cleaning it out on a regular basis, like two or three times a week, then all that's going to just keep building up and building, building up and building.
[01:02:51.466 --> 01:02:53.366]  That's why bowel diseases are off the charts.
[01:02:53.366 --> 01:02:57.728]  And I'm going to have you back in soon to do a whole hour just on gut support.
[01:02:57.728 --> 01:02:58.548]  It's amazing.
[01:02:58.548 --> 01:02:59.989]  Why is nascent iodine so key?
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:04.721]  Mason, iodine's so key because how many people do you know are losing their hair now?
[01:03:04.721 --> 01:03:08.942]  How many people do you know that have cold hands and cold feet, especially women?
[01:03:08.942 --> 01:03:16.305]  If you have that extra weight around your waist area, all of that has to do with thyroid and all that can be linked to iodine deficiency.
[01:03:16.305 --> 01:03:18.305]  How many people do you know that don't sweat?
[01:03:18.305 --> 01:03:21.666]  A lot of times when people don't sweat, it's an iodine deficiency.
[01:03:21.666 --> 01:03:27.048]  I would say that if you were to look at every single thing, and I've researched every mineral, vitamin for over 20 years,
[01:03:28.268 --> 01:03:31.630]  I would say oxygen is one of the most important things you can put in the body.
[01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:33.051]  It's the ultimate detoxifier.
[01:03:33.051 --> 01:03:35.272]  The second thing is iodine.
[01:03:35.272 --> 01:03:39.754]  Iodine is regulated and needed by every single cell inside your system.
[01:03:39.754 --> 01:03:51.100]  If you can trace every disease pretty much has something to do with iodine, whether it's too much fluoride coming in, whether it's too much bromide coming into the body... Which they try to pile on us!
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.541]  Which they try to pile on you.
[01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:54.943]  And then we have the documents where they admit they're doing it on purpose.
[01:03:54.943 --> 01:03:57.446]  It's not like 2 plus 2, it looks like they're doing it on purpose.
[01:03:57.446 --> 01:03:58.887]  They admit they're doing it.
[01:03:58.887 --> 01:04:00.809]  No, it's all a fact.
[01:04:00.809 --> 01:04:02.030]  I mean, it's all a fact.
[01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:05.013]  And when they know, that's why they took iodine out of the bread.
[01:04:05.013 --> 01:04:06.955]  That's why they took iodine out of the salt.
[01:04:06.955 --> 01:04:13.881]  Because they know that anyone who's deficient in iodine, and you talk about mental retardation and problems with brain function.
[01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:19.061]  Women, pregnant women, need twice as much iodine during pregnancy.
[01:04:19.061 --> 01:04:21.743]  And the RDA is 150 micrograms a day.
[01:04:21.743 --> 01:04:27.168]  I mean, that's just enough to prevent a goiter in studies that were done on rats.
[01:04:27.168 --> 01:04:29.671]  And so they do it so you don't get the goiter and know.
[01:04:29.671 --> 01:04:35.816]  They do it right at the level of absolute scientific targeting with hatred.
[01:04:35.816 --> 01:04:37.438]  Oh, but they would inject people with syphilis.
[01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:38.078]  They love us.
[01:04:39.392 --> 01:04:44.537]  Maybe I'm nuts because I would have warned somebody, black or white, don't go in that clinic and get injected with syphilis.
[01:04:44.537 --> 01:04:46.779]  That means I'm a bad person.
[01:04:46.779 --> 01:04:50.183]  Right, I mean we're all bad for warning people because we're going against the system.
[01:04:50.183 --> 01:04:55.107]  I mean in the system... Yeah, so everybody go have the government inject you with cancer viruses and syphilis.
[01:04:55.107 --> 01:04:56.148]  They love you.
[01:04:56.148 --> 01:04:56.369]  Okay?
[01:04:56.369 --> 01:04:57.870]  There's too many of us.
[01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:58.611]  Ted Turner's right.

[01:08:11.641 --> 01:08:13.181]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.181 --> 01:08:17.382]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.382 --> 01:08:21.443]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.244 --> 01:08:34.697]  Dr. Ed Group and Anthony Gucciardi are both here in studio with us with some big breaking news that came out yesterday on Fox News, a new Lancet study.
[01:08:34.697 --> 01:08:41.668]  There's also another big study that's come out that we're going to be breaking down.
[01:08:42.389 --> 01:08:47.271]  Dealing with BPA levels and attacking the chromosomes of the body.
[01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:48.412]  Now, we already knew this.
[01:08:48.412 --> 01:08:51.253]  Our guests, doctors and experts said this 15 years ago.
[01:08:51.253 --> 01:08:52.954]  They know, and they do this on purpose.
[01:08:52.954 --> 01:08:55.135]  It's actually more expensive for them to add the BPA.
[01:08:55.135 --> 01:08:58.616]  I've talked to top engineers, chemical engineers, retired engineers.
[01:08:58.616 --> 01:08:59.877]  They don't know why they're ordered to do it.
[01:08:59.877 --> 01:09:00.957]  Well, I know why.
[01:09:00.957 --> 01:09:02.418]  It reduces fertility massively.
[01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:05.983]  And of course it retards development.
[01:09:05.983 --> 01:09:06.924]  That's all part of the fun.
[01:09:06.924 --> 01:09:08.547]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[01:09:08.547 --> 01:09:11.932]  The big story up at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:11.932 --> 01:09:17.681]  Updated Chase Bank limits, cash withdrawals, bans international wire transfers.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.342]  Capital controls imposed on small business owners.
[01:09:23.342 --> 01:09:28.024]  And this really points towards hyperinflation, which is what QE Unlimited will do.
[01:09:28.024 --> 01:09:32.186]  We'll talk about it with Lennon LaRouche coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:32.186 --> 01:09:43.310]  And then we've got a bunch of pro-Second Amendment activists popping in in the next hour ahead of an armed march to demonstrate the Second Amendment in San Antonio that I will be attending, and I will be carrying a .308 Reaper rifle
[01:09:46.111 --> 01:09:51.777]  As well totally legal and lawful and the police chief said he will now honor the Second Amendment and will not be arresting people.
[01:09:51.777 --> 01:09:54.539]  So hope to see all the listeners down at that.
[01:09:54.539 --> 01:09:55.821]  That is coming up 10 a.m.
[01:09:55.821 --> 01:09:59.204]  in front of the Alamo, San Antonio, Texas.
[01:09:59.204 --> 01:10:10.374]  Here's the AP article BPA miscarriage link study finds chemical may raise risk and they've got a bunch of different big studies that are now coming out
[01:10:11.803 --> 01:10:12.764]  on this front.
[01:10:12.764 --> 01:10:16.027]  In fact, the article I had yesterday actually showed the two different studies.
[01:10:16.027 --> 01:10:19.751]  But Anthony Gucciardi is here with Dr. Ed Group.
[01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:23.795]  And Anthony, you first talk about BPA, then we'll get Dr. Group's take on this.
[01:10:23.795 --> 01:10:23.995]  Sure.
[01:10:23.995 --> 01:10:27.458]  So we know for years now that BPA is linked to breast cancer.
[01:10:27.458 --> 01:10:30.941]  Over 130 studies besides Susan G Komen denying it.
[01:10:30.941 --> 01:10:33.063]  And we know for a fact it's causing infertility.
[01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:35.105]  But here's the most interesting thing about this study.
[01:10:35.105 --> 01:10:36.747]  Not only does it, of course, increase your risk,
[01:10:37.347 --> 01:10:37.807]  We're good to go.
[01:11:07.014 --> 01:11:10.295]  Yeah, a Stanford University endocrinologist was saying that.
[01:11:10.295 --> 01:11:12.495]  This is in the Associated Press, mainstream media.
[01:11:12.495 --> 01:11:18.457]  So they're saying now it looks like BPA is going in, infiltrating the chromosomes and warping them and affecting the eggs.
[01:11:18.457 --> 01:11:20.778]  Just like last year's study showed GMOs.
[01:11:20.778 --> 01:11:22.398]  Exactly, so we're being infiltrated.
[01:11:22.398 --> 01:11:26.599]  Notice also at the end it says, it is impossible to avoid it completely, speaking on BPA.
[01:11:26.599 --> 01:11:29.520]  But here's the thing, a woman is born with a preset amount of eggs.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:40.347]  In the event that BPA is so just invasive in our food supply and our overall environmental health, what's happening is all eggs are being targeted and destroyed.
[01:11:40.347 --> 01:11:41.928]  This is a children of men scenario.
[01:11:41.928 --> 01:11:42.629]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:44.510]  So we could have widespread infertility.
[01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:48.613]  It's not like someone's going to be born in a third world nation with lower BPA.
[01:11:48.613 --> 01:11:53.757]  It seems like the United States is being hit so heavily that all women now are being affected.
[01:11:53.757 --> 01:11:57.499]  And by the way, it's on almost all the printer ink, the receipts.
[01:11:57.499 --> 01:11:58.520]  And again, I've talked to the
[01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:03.745]  The chemical engineers, the people that run these plants, they go, there's no reason.
[01:12:03.745 --> 01:12:07.529]  They have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of different combinations where this isn't needed.
[01:12:07.529 --> 01:12:08.510]  This is done on purpose.
[01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:11.554]  No, you mentioned earlier, it costs more to make stuff with BPA.
[01:12:11.554 --> 01:12:13.255]  It's also in dollar bills.
[01:12:13.255 --> 01:12:14.497]  90% of currencies contain BPA.
[01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:15.418]  Chemical weapon.
[01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:15.658]  Yeah.
[01:12:15.658 --> 01:12:16.939]  Complete decimation.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:30.229]  Well, you know, one of the things we've been focusing on is BPA, is detoxification of BPA, because it's an endocrine disruptor, and it disrupts the thyroid, it disrupts the metabolism, it alters estrogen levels in the body.
[01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:34.512]  We already have high estrogen levels, men and female, because of all the soy that's out there.
[01:12:34.512 --> 01:12:38.614]  But John P. Holdren said in Ecoscience in 1974 that there's too many of us.
[01:12:38.614 --> 01:12:44.779]  Well, the point is, you know, people say, well, there are too many of us, and they go along with that argument, but we're all being hit, don't you get it?
[01:12:45.279 --> 01:12:50.526]  These yuppies are going to try to have kids while they say there's too many people and there's a chemical weapon program.
[01:12:50.526 --> 01:12:51.747]  This is big news.
[01:12:51.747 --> 01:13:00.098]  If you go in any supermarket and you pick up any container, you know, the milk jugs, the plastic water bottles,
[01:13:00.899 --> 01:13:05.281]  It's going to contain the paper liners, the paper plates, paper, just the jugs.
[01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:06.581]  I mean, even the organic.
[01:13:06.581 --> 01:13:12.123]  I mean, you can like the organic coconut that's in the little flimsy containers.
[01:13:12.123 --> 01:13:16.265]  What they have is aluminum lining and then they have BPA over that.
[01:13:16.265 --> 01:13:20.427]  And I was just at the Supply Side Expo in Las Vegas and I was looking at packaging out there.
[01:13:21.187 --> 01:13:24.211]  It's the biggest manufacturing packaging expo there is.
[01:13:24.211 --> 01:13:31.760]  Every single supplier of packaging material out there has aluminum lined containers with a coat of BPA on them.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.826]  And not only that, what most people don't know, and this is what I found out for the first time... It's the juice box liners!
[01:13:36.886 --> 01:13:37.326]  For the kids!
[01:13:54.051 --> 01:13:56.914]  That's right, they've always been lobbying to get it legalized just ten years ago.
[01:13:56.914 --> 01:14:02.200]  They also sprayed live viruses on meat that eat the bacteria that are grown in giant vaccine vats.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:07.266]  That's, guys, you can type in viral spray sprayed on meat, ABC News, six years ago.
[01:14:07.266 --> 01:14:13.592]  And now, exactly, you saying you were there, they're moving to make everyone, with the FDA, make everyone irradiated.
[01:14:14.448 --> 01:14:14.908]  That's right.
[01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:23.052]  I mean, nobody knows that all their organic food and all their dietary supplements are going through x-ray machines before they go into the packaging system.
[01:14:23.052 --> 01:14:26.453]  And, you know, I tried to get some information on it.
[01:14:26.453 --> 01:14:30.775]  Is that, is it absolutely a regulatory thing right now?
[01:14:30.775 --> 01:14:39.259]  And it's not, but all the companies are doing it and they're saying we're doing it because we want to make sure there's no metal or any shavings of anything.
[01:14:39.259 --> 01:14:40.559]  It's always for our safety.
[01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:41.500]  Yeah, it's for our safety.
[01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:47.556]  And the pharmaceutical drugs are also using BPA, but so are the nutraceutical industry heads.
[01:14:47.556 --> 01:14:55.661]  They're putting BPA, because for who knows why it's more expensive, they're putting BPA into nutraceuticals now, like, you know, natural supplements.
[01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:56.822]  So it's just so pervasive.
[01:14:56.822 --> 01:14:59.564]  That's why you have to go with a brand that does not have it.
[01:14:59.984 --> 01:15:04.127]  It's like vitamins are having aspartame added when it's not even a vitamin that you dissolve in your mouth.
[01:15:04.127 --> 01:15:07.609]  It's just, oh, well, this is the new vitamin, the wood alcohol you needed.
[01:15:07.609 --> 01:15:08.370]  They're loading it up.
[01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:14.374]  By the way, survival shield that's backordered that you developed, I'm telling you, this is special nascent iodine.
[01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:22.638]  You were telling me off air, it's called survival shield because this type of nascent atomic iodine is a shield for so much of this.
[01:15:22.638 --> 01:15:25.499]  And then tell me, let's talk about the leading competitor.
[01:15:25.499 --> 01:15:27.940]  We pulled the label off, I feel sorry for him.
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:38.103]  We tried to be honest, Dr. Group, as you know, you said fine, go ahead and do that, to find other people to make nascent iodine and we got it and we can't sell it because we cannot sell this to our customers.
[01:15:38.103 --> 01:15:41.985]  You are the only guy in the country, you even have your own factory as well.
[01:15:41.985 --> 01:15:44.386]  Why is yours different than the leading competitor and what does it do?
[01:15:45.086 --> 01:15:52.770]  Well, first of all, there's a major shortage right now because everybody in Japan, China, and all over the world wants iodine.
[01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:54.571]  And they want the best form available.
[01:15:54.571 --> 01:15:57.413]  So, I mean, that's a lot of the reason why you're on backorder.
[01:15:57.413 --> 01:16:03.016]  And that's why I suggest everybody just try to stock up as much as possible because it's only going to get worse.
[01:16:03.016 --> 01:16:07.378]  We're getting calls from Japan, China, and everything else where they want to buy the raw iodine.
[01:16:07.378 --> 01:16:10.480]  They want to buy the nascent iodine because they know how
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.301]  Fast, it works.
[01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:15.383]  I mean, the nascent iodine isn't electrically charged.
[01:16:15.383 --> 01:16:22.808]  I mean, it goes through a special processing, our processing system, which makes it different than any of the other forms of iodine out there.
[01:16:22.808 --> 01:16:27.372]  I mean, this would be a standard form of nascent iodine, which is in an alcohol base.
[01:16:27.372 --> 01:16:29.253]  Here, let's show folks the leading competitor right here.
[01:16:29.253 --> 01:16:31.615]  That's what it does to the top in a year.
[01:16:31.615 --> 01:16:35.638]  Rob Dew actually bought this a year ago, and this is what is in his office on the shelf, did that.
[01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:41.886]  Uh, this is ours versus that, and you have a bottle you did 20-something years ago, still tastes just like that in the glycerin.
[01:16:41.886 --> 01:16:44.209]  That actually tastes good, uh, to me.
[01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:46.031]  It tastes sweet compared to that.
[01:16:46.031 --> 01:16:50.237]  Tastes like the most nasty thing I, and I, I mean, I can drink, like, 10 shots of Jack Daniels straight.
[01:16:50.237 --> 01:16:51.639]  Tastes like mama's milk to me.
[01:16:51.639 --> 01:16:53.842]  I mean, I mean, I can, I can handle anything, and I can't do that.
[01:16:53.882 --> 01:16:54.482]  No, actually.
[01:16:54.482 --> 01:16:55.063]  What's the difference?
[01:17:23.922 --> 01:17:27.245]  By the way, let's be clear, we went all over trying.
[01:17:27.245 --> 01:17:28.867]  No, we actually wanted this to be good.
[01:17:28.867 --> 01:17:43.000]  In fact, the crazy thing is, we were actually looking to have this made by these people and getting tests, and they basically are nice folks to admit, well, it... And then Alex wanted to try it, so we were like, well, let's try it, you know, see what it tastes like, and he literally stepped backwards.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:43.460]  I don't know.
[01:18:06.701 --> 01:18:12.164]  Well, first of all, the standard old school method of doing nascent iodine is in an alcohol base.
[01:18:12.164 --> 01:18:13.504]  And that's 100% alcohol.
[01:18:13.504 --> 01:18:14.405]  That's like Everclear.
[01:18:14.405 --> 01:18:16.546]  You could run your car on that stuff.
[01:18:16.546 --> 01:18:18.386]  I would never give that to a baby.
[01:18:18.386 --> 01:18:19.647]  I would never give it to my kid.
[01:18:19.647 --> 01:18:21.568]  I mean, it's going to burn their mouth.
[01:18:21.568 --> 01:18:22.908]  They're not going to want it.
[01:18:22.908 --> 01:18:32.193]  What we did is we took 10 years to develop a new technology, which is basically a thermodynamic, pressure sensitive,
[01:18:33.353 --> 01:18:38.478]  I was talking, you guys have this proprietary, my dad looked this up, because I've done years of research,
[01:18:52.313 --> 01:19:01.718]  He said, no, they're like the only specially certified, I guess it's all secret or whatever, but the government had to certify it, where I guess it's a gas and it's injected in or something?
[01:19:01.718 --> 01:19:04.580]  And all this other, I mean, I guess, I don't know how you guys do that.
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:07.702]  Well, put it this way, you know, I love doing stuff like that.
[01:19:07.702 --> 01:19:12.024]  I'm a big fan of Nikola Tesla and quantum physics, and that's kind of my hobby.
[01:19:12.024 --> 01:19:17.507]  So what we did was I actually worked with two Russian physicists, some of the top Russian physicists.
[01:19:17.507 --> 01:19:18.568]  Oh, you never bragged about this.
[01:19:18.568 --> 01:19:19.288]  I went and looked it up.
[01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:20.809]  It's like in the National Institutes of
[01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:22.090]  Health and stuff.
[01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.010]  I didn't even know that.
[01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:26.293]  Yeah, so anyway, it took over a period of time.
[01:19:26.293 --> 01:19:32.037]  I mean, that's why people will say, well, you can't get that many micrograms of iodine in vegetable glycerin.
[01:19:32.037 --> 01:19:36.781]  Well, vegetable glycerin, first of all, is a lot heavier than alcohol, so you have to do the calculations different.
[01:19:36.781 --> 01:19:44.366]  But this way, you have an active form of nascent iodine, which is going to penetrate and be used by all the
[01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:45.867]  Punk!
[01:19:45.867 --> 01:19:52.090]  It's safe to say you're the only person to develop it and it's only available through InfoWars Life, the survival shield, folks.
[01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:53.470]  This is a big deal.
[01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:56.292]  You can pre-order it right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:56.812]  It's sold out.
[01:19:56.812 --> 01:19:59.493]  They're making more right now.
[01:19:59.493 --> 01:20:00.393]  We gotta go to break.
[01:20:00.393 --> 01:20:00.653]  Awesome.
[01:20:00.653 --> 01:20:01.574]  Alex Jones here.
[01:20:02.054 --> 01:20:06.257]  And I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:20:06.257 --> 01:20:15.143]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:22.969]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:20:22.969 --> 01:20:30.374]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:20:30.874 --> 01:20:34.816]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.

[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:05.341]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[01:21:05.341 --> 01:21:14.983]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:21:14.983 --> 01:21:26.905]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:21:27.225 --> 01:21:31.809]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[01:21:31.809 --> 01:21:33.590]  And they're so easy to use.
[01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:35.512]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[01:21:35.512 --> 01:21:39.515]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[01:21:39.515 --> 01:21:41.277]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.

[01:24:14.125 --> 01:24:16.325]  All right, final segment with you guys.
[01:24:16.325 --> 01:24:28.989]  I know you're going to go tape something for the nightly news next week, but I want to get it up quickly because we have a lot of frequently asked questions about nascent iodine, the real nascent iodine that you've produced for us and developed for Infowarslife.com.
[01:24:28.989 --> 01:24:36.291]  But, I mean, it really is survival shield from all the research I've done, all the experts I've talked to, because if you don't have this, all the bad stuff goes in the thyroid.
[01:24:36.291 --> 01:24:41.073]  And then how does that tie into things like bisphenol A and what we're being bombarded with, Dr. Group?
[01:24:41.553 --> 01:24:43.855]  Well, bisphenol A is a thyroid disruptor.
[01:24:43.855 --> 01:24:45.116]  It's an endocrine disruptor.
[01:24:45.116 --> 01:24:50.199]  And I mean, when you look at all, first of all, all the cells in the body require iodine.
[01:24:50.199 --> 01:24:57.065]  But the endocrine, the thyroid to produce the T3 to produce T4, which is just tyrosine plus iodine molecules.
[01:24:57.905 --> 01:25:08.474]  Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism all due to or can be linked back at least 99.9% of the cases to an iodine deficiency.
[01:25:08.474 --> 01:25:12.517]  And what's happening out there is iodine is a major detoxifier.
[01:25:12.517 --> 01:25:14.659]  I mean we're talking about all these chemicals.
[01:25:14.659 --> 01:25:18.883]  Iodine detoxifies fluoride, it detoxifies chlorine, bromine.
[01:25:19.543 --> 01:25:21.204]  It detoxifies mercury.
[01:25:21.204 --> 01:25:23.886]  It detoxifies lead from the body.
[01:25:23.886 --> 01:25:35.072]  So if someone is taking a nascent iodine and they start developing symptoms like maybe skin rash or upset stomach or something, that's a telltale sign that it's working so good.
[01:25:35.072 --> 01:25:39.135]  It's probably pulling that bromine out and is detoxifying your body.
[01:25:39.135 --> 01:25:40.535]  It's all about detoxification.
[01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:40.936]  That's why
[01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:56.215]  Not only will all of your organs start functioning better, and your skin, your dry skin will go away, and if you have problems with your salivary glands in your mouth, if your tongue feels too big for your mouth, that's another indication that you're low on iodine.
[01:25:57.264 --> 01:25:59.345]  The list goes on and on and on, Alex.
[01:25:59.345 --> 01:26:09.207]  I mean, the fact is, there was studies done with over 5,000 patients, and 95 to 96% of those people that were tested were deficient in iodine.
[01:26:09.207 --> 01:26:16.990]  It's something that you're not going to get from the food, and it's something that... But, I mean, you didn't... I mean, you brag and said yours was unique, but this, this, this is really special.
[01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:20.911]  Because I guess, I mean, I guess the stuff that tastes horrible that they call niacin iodine is actually good for you?
[01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:35.066]  It's not bad for you, it's just the fact that, number one, it's an alcohol base, and number two, you know, you want to use iodine during pregnancy, you want to use iodine for children, and you don't want to use that with alcohol.
[01:26:35.066 --> 01:26:39.491]  I mean, alcohol is an addictive substance, it's a drug, it's probably one of the worst drugs out there, actually.
[01:26:39.491 --> 01:26:40.112]  It's with Al-Qaeda.
[01:26:40.772 --> 01:27:02.902]  And, you know, it's like technology hasn't changed in a hundred and something years, so what we wanted to do was just bring new technology, something that could be absorbed very rapidly, something that everybody could take, they could get their iodine in a usable form, they could give it to their children, women could take it during pregnancy, and oh my gosh, if you have iodine around the house,
[01:27:03.522 --> 01:27:06.463]  And your whole family's taking it.
[01:27:06.463 --> 01:27:15.568]  You know, if we had every single person in the United States or in the world doing that, it would drastically reduce, probably it would put the pharmaceutical industry out of business.
[01:27:15.568 --> 01:27:16.268]  But they don't want that.
[01:27:16.268 --> 01:27:20.630]  They want to bankrupt America and the Western world with this weaponized medicine program.
[01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:25.833]  In closing, you have Frequently Asked Questions and Infowarslife.com on the iodine where people can pre-order it.
[01:27:25.833 --> 01:27:27.774]  It's from when the next batch comes in, they get it.
[01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:30.635]  And of course, you produce it yourself as well.
[01:27:30.635 --> 01:27:32.576]  That's way back ordered and sold out as well.
[01:27:32.576 --> 01:27:36.557]  So people can go to InfoWarsLife.com, and it's the exact same item you produce just for us and yourself.
[01:27:36.557 --> 01:27:38.858]  We're very thankful that you did partner with us.
[01:27:38.858 --> 01:27:42.739]  I know you've turned on a lot of other people, and I'm very honored, Dr. Grip, you've done this with us.
[01:27:42.739 --> 01:27:47.641]  I know you're very successful with your whole nutraceutical line, and we're just honored to be working with you.
[01:27:48.407 --> 01:27:49.287]  Thanks, I appreciate it.
[01:27:49.287 --> 01:27:59.792]  By the way, one more thing is there's no bacteria that's resistant to iodine, no virus resistant to iodine, no fungus resistant to iodine, no mycoplasm resistant to iodine.
[01:27:59.792 --> 01:28:09.576]  So we talk about if there's a biological warfare, which we know that's being injected through the vaccines and through the air, iodine is going to protect people against any type of biological warfare.
[01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:09.996]  Amazing.
[01:28:09.996 --> 01:28:13.258]  And then on top of it, the glycerin in this is non-GMO.
[01:28:13.678 --> 01:28:16.840]  We talked to all these companies, and it's very hard to get other people.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.260]  That's why we haven't done more of this.
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:21.182]  We can't find anybody that will really give us a pure product.
[01:28:21.182 --> 01:28:22.282]  No, that's exactly right.
[01:28:22.282 --> 01:28:33.148]  In fact, before all of this, before we got into Survival Shield, one of the things I was doing is trying to find suppliers for not just Iodine, just everything that I wanted personally, and to help other people, with non-GMO.
[01:28:33.148 --> 01:28:36.889]  Because all of my readers were saying, basically, how do I find something that's super non-GMO?
[01:28:36.889 --> 01:28:39.831]  And when I would contact the big three, the nutraceutical people,
[01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:47.052]  They would say, yeah, you know, we kind of try to not use GMOs because some of our consumers think it's bad, but we can't guarantee it.
[01:28:47.052 --> 01:28:50.473]  And I'd say, well, does this specifically, you know, the vitamin C contain GMO?
[01:28:50.473 --> 01:28:54.314]  And they say, well, about 98% of corn is GMO.
[01:28:54.314 --> 01:28:55.674]  So we extract it from the corn.
[01:28:55.674 --> 01:28:58.715]  So chances are, yes, but we try to use non-GMO sources.
[01:28:58.715 --> 01:29:00.455]  So that's unacceptable to me.
[01:29:00.455 --> 01:29:04.436]  We have to push the anti here and say, this is totally certified up one side, down the other.
[01:29:04.876 --> 01:29:05.256]  Amazing.
[01:29:05.256 --> 01:29:07.918]  Well, guys, I know you're going to go shoot some stuff for the news.
[01:29:07.918 --> 01:29:11.421]  I know you've got to go soon, Dr. Group, to get back to your operation down in South Texas.
[01:29:11.421 --> 01:29:15.303]  It's just, Anthony, I want to get the frequently asked questions for him to talk about those.
[01:29:15.303 --> 01:29:17.865]  And also, if you start taking in how you might detox.
[01:29:17.865 --> 01:29:19.326]  So, you know, be careful.
[01:29:19.326 --> 01:29:20.667]  Consult a physician.
[01:29:20.667 --> 01:29:22.388]  This is serious stuff what they've done to us.
[01:29:22.388 --> 01:29:26.130]  And when it's coming out, believe me, I had a lot more energy, even a lot more aggressive.
[01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:26.591]  You name it.
[01:29:26.591 --> 01:29:27.551]  My muscles are getting bigger.
[01:29:27.551 --> 01:29:28.832]  I've lost some weight.
[01:29:28.832 --> 01:29:32.775]  But at the same time, about two months into it, I'm also feel almost hung over sometimes.
[01:29:32.775 --> 01:29:34.456]  And you were telling me that's normal, Dr. Group.
[01:29:35.196 --> 01:29:37.097]  It is normal when you first start taking.
[01:29:37.097 --> 01:29:39.258]  Well, it depends on the dose and depends on the person.
[01:29:39.258 --> 01:29:43.219]  A lot of times if, you know, we have a lot of people walking around with fatty livers.
[01:29:43.219 --> 01:29:43.500]  You know what?
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:47.341]  You'll talk about that coming up in the piece we'll have on the Nightly News tonight or tomorrow.
[01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:48.362]  You're gonna go take that right now.

[01:32:01.209 --> 01:32:05.153]  Research shows that the next Great Depression is inevitable and unstoppable.
[01:32:05.153 --> 01:32:07.335]  It is suicide to not be prepared.
[01:32:07.335 --> 01:32:12.780]  Some reviews are already saying that Locusts on the Horizon is one of the best prepper books ever written.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:17.124]  It provides over 1100 pages for the full spectrum of vital prepper knowledge.

[01:32:46.407 --> 01:32:47.468]  Time is running out.
[01:32:47.468 --> 01:32:49.149]  The time to prepare is now.
[01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:52.852]  Your copy of Locusts on the Horizon is available immediately on Amazon.
[01:32:53.132 --> 01:32:55.954]  Or you can go to locustsonthehorizon.com.

[01:33:11.887 --> 01:33:19.634]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:29.976]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just broke down a lot of important health news.
[01:33:29.976 --> 01:33:38.442]  Shifting gears, the top story on InfoWars.com is also the top story on DrugsReport.com.
[01:33:38.442 --> 01:33:48.469]  And it says, chase fees on cash, limits withdrawals on some accounts, bans foreign wire transfers.
[01:33:48.469 --> 01:33:50.531]  Money can come in, but it can't go out.
[01:33:51.997 --> 01:33:58.681]  And breaking today or tomorrow, I have other sources that say other big banks are telling their customers, get ready for similar things.
[01:33:58.681 --> 01:34:02.243]  This is the beginning of capital controls.
[01:34:02.243 --> 01:34:06.565]  For those that don't know, when a country goes into hyperinflation, they usually don't let you get your money out of the country.
[01:34:06.565 --> 01:34:07.566]  They don't let you leave.
[01:34:08.106 --> 01:34:13.469]  And the article updated this morning is up on DrudgeReport.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:34:13.469 --> 01:34:15.411]  Very, very important.
[01:34:15.411 --> 01:34:22.635]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, you can go to LaRouche PAC, and we'll put the website up on screen for folks coming up.
[01:34:22.635 --> 01:34:29.559]  LaRouchePAC.com, L-A-R-O-U-C-H-E-PAC.com, and find all the documentation and videos.
[01:34:29.559 --> 01:34:31.721]  Lyndon LaRouche has been called a right-winger by the left.
[01:34:32.461 --> 01:34:34.083]  He's been called a left-winger by the right.
[01:34:34.083 --> 01:34:42.510]  He, Ronald Reagan, I looked this up when I heard it over 15 years ago, it was true, you know, called him, you know, just incredibly smart on geopolitics.
[01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:45.613]  Two CIA directors listened to what he had to say.
[01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:51.839]  He would do weekly briefings flying his helicopter to the lonely Virginia and landing and having secret briefings with the CIA director.
[01:34:51.839 --> 01:34:54.761]  I mean, what they talked about was reportedly secret.
[01:34:54.761 --> 01:34:56.543]  That made George Bush Sr.
[01:34:56.543 --> 01:34:57.143]  jealous of him.
[01:34:57.944 --> 01:35:02.587]  So they set him up and threw him in the Huskow as a political prisoner.
[01:35:02.587 --> 01:35:06.110]  And whenever I talk about government corruption, they go, oh, that's Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:07.731]  People don't even know who he is.
[01:35:07.731 --> 01:35:11.553]  You know, young people sometimes they just think, oh, that's like a dirty word or something.
[01:35:11.553 --> 01:35:13.414]  Of course, that that has failed.
[01:35:13.414 --> 01:35:14.755]  The system's tried to do that.
[01:35:14.755 --> 01:35:24.122]  I don't necessarily agree with all of the solutions they come up with, but you cannot doubt their analysis of geopolitics and how it works is very, very accurate.
[01:35:24.122 --> 01:35:26.503]  We're always honored to have Mr. LaRouche on.
[01:35:26.503 --> 01:35:27.564]  He's a World War Two veteran.
[01:35:28.924 --> 01:35:30.845]  He's only with us for two segments.
[01:35:30.845 --> 01:35:35.587]  Then we've got a bunch of other international news and Second Amendment news coming up.
[01:35:35.587 --> 01:35:37.367]  But I wanted to get him on because it was back last year
[01:35:49.952 --> 01:36:03.106]  He was on the air and folks have pulled these clips up and pointed them out and warned of nuclear blackmail domestically, warned of currency devaluation, warned of mega crises if we didn't impeach Obama.
[01:36:03.106 --> 01:36:06.149]  Now they have started to devalue the U.S.
[01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:10.874]  credit rating, using the debt crisis to bring us into this current situation.
[01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:22.295]  And really blame people concerned about debt with the insolvency of the Anglo-American banking establishment that itself is completely zombie.
[01:36:22.295 --> 01:36:30.359]  So I want to get him to talk about geopolitically where we are, what's happening with the big banks, what just happened with the shutdown, where things are going.
[01:36:30.359 --> 01:36:31.920]  And so we're joined by Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.161]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:36:33.976 --> 01:36:35.337]  Good to be with you.
[01:36:35.337 --> 01:36:36.217]  Okay, sir, so go ahead.
[01:36:36.217 --> 01:36:36.918]  You've got the floor.
[01:36:36.918 --> 01:36:38.699]  Where are we geopolitically?
[01:36:38.699 --> 01:36:40.320]  What's happening in the banking sector?
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:45.023]  Why are big banks saying you're not going to, you know, be able to get your money out of the country?
[01:36:45.023 --> 01:36:46.384]  What's happening?
[01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:56.370]  We're going through an actual, if it goes through any further, we're going through a mass rate of death in the United States.
[01:36:56.370 --> 01:36:59.592]  It's going on in Europe also, similarly.
[01:36:59.592 --> 01:37:00.313]  But this trend
[01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:09.332]  And the policy of this president, Barack Obama, is mass murder.
[01:37:09.332 --> 01:37:11.213]  There's no question about it.
[01:37:11.213 --> 01:37:16.055]  This is Hitler kind stuff.
[01:37:16.055 --> 01:37:27.159]  Quantify that, sir, because you've been predicting exactly what's now happening and then using the crisis they've engineered to bring in total control, the gear up of Homeland Security against the American people.
[01:37:27.159 --> 01:37:28.300]  Mr. LaRouche, what's happening?
[01:37:28.922 --> 01:37:39.607]  What's happened is that our government has been taken over by a secret government, which is associated with President Obama.
[01:37:40.643 --> 01:37:43.045]  And this has gone through one step and another.
[01:37:43.045 --> 01:37:48.350]  We've just gone through another step, which is actually really mass murder.
[01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:51.553]  Mass murder of citizens of the United States.
[01:37:51.553 --> 01:37:54.215]  That's the only term you can call for.
[01:37:54.215 --> 01:38:00.681]  This is, of course, Obama's been up to this in his first year in office.
[01:38:01.866 --> 01:38:02.066]  I think?
[01:38:17.719 --> 01:38:19.300]  That's right, for those that don't know,
[01:38:45.223 --> 01:38:52.888]  IMF World Bank loans and high rates are on record killing tens of millions a year worldwide and now that's expanding into Europe.
[01:38:52.888 --> 01:38:55.249]  People starving, riots, you name it.
[01:38:55.249 --> 01:38:56.390]  More and more of that coming here.
[01:38:56.390 --> 01:39:11.499]  But sir, I remember six years ago when Obama, or seven years ago, was running and some of the folks over at larouchepac.com and also at the publication going to meetings
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:28.619]  With Obama's healthcare head, even before he was elected, exposing the plan for death panels, exposing the plan for ration care, exposing it was actually a Trojan horse, not even real socialist healthcare for people, but a fascist healthcare system, you were
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:40.608]  Your organization were the first, and people can go see the videos on your site, I was just remembering them, to expose how bad it was before the bill was even written or introduced.
[01:39:40.608 --> 01:39:45.851]  Break down what was really in the bill and how your team knew what was in it.
[01:39:45.851 --> 01:39:47.272]  Well, that's my specialty.
[01:39:47.272 --> 01:39:48.173]  That's what I do.
[01:39:48.173 --> 01:39:50.754]  It's not just on this subject, but other subjects.
[01:39:50.754 --> 01:39:53.456]  I'm concerned with the world economy.
[01:39:53.456 --> 01:39:55.798]  I'm a specialist in forecasting in that area.
[01:39:56.633 --> 01:39:59.595]  And I have a lot of influence in that area, naturally.
[01:39:59.595 --> 01:40:03.797]  How big it is, or how big it is personally, is not relevant.
[01:40:03.797 --> 01:40:13.883]  The fact is that I'm on the case where other people have not, and more and more people realize again and again that I'm on the case.
[01:40:13.883 --> 01:40:15.885]  I could expand on that, but it's that simple.
[01:40:15.885 --> 01:40:17.165]  I mean, this is what I do.
[01:40:17.165 --> 01:40:18.606]  I'm a forecaster.
[01:40:18.606 --> 01:40:19.467]  I'm an economist.
[01:40:20.922 --> 01:40:22.524]  I do a lot of forecasting.
[01:40:22.524 --> 01:40:27.707]  I'm probably one of the most successful forecaster in terms of very specific kinds of forecasting.
[01:40:27.707 --> 01:40:32.990]  When did you first start to work with international intelligence and the CIA?
[01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:34.011]  Wasn't it in the OSS?
[01:40:34.011 --> 01:40:39.634]  I mean, how did you, because I find this fascinating for your view on the world, 90 years old, things you've seen.
[01:40:40.595 --> 01:40:45.776]  How did you get to where you were giving weekly briefings to the CIA directors in the 1980s?
[01:40:45.776 --> 01:40:50.697]  And what did that inside track give you on the different factions in the system?
[01:40:50.697 --> 01:40:56.118]  Well, I can say it goes back to the 1980s.
[01:40:56.118 --> 01:41:03.059]  In 1971, for example, I first made a forecast of what was going to happen.
[01:41:03.059 --> 01:41:04.259]  I made it actually in 1968.
[01:41:04.259 --> 01:41:05.039]  And this, it hit.
[01:41:10.119 --> 01:41:11.700]  I had made the forecast.
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:16.423]  Everybody else in the forecasting business had said it was not possible.
[01:41:16.423 --> 01:41:17.163]  What happened?
[01:41:17.163 --> 01:41:19.985]  That 1971 collapse.
[01:41:19.985 --> 01:41:32.533]  And from that point, I was challenged by a British representative of the British system on this case, and I defeated him in a debate which we had in Queens College.
[01:41:32.533 --> 01:41:33.733]  And this thing stuck.
[01:41:33.733 --> 01:41:38.136]  And from that point on, I was a... Well, I'd been a forecaster and so forth,
[01:41:39.128 --> 01:41:46.032]  Give us the facts now on where we are geopolitically, financially, and what's happening in the markets, what's happening
[01:42:04.648 --> 01:42:10.159]  With the system blaming the global derivatives debt on people that are concerned about it.
[01:42:10.159 --> 01:42:15.529]  I mean, they're trying to blame those of us now that have been concerned for what they've done.
[01:42:17.217 --> 01:42:21.000]  No, there's no lack of evidence on this thing.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.362]  This is what has happened.
[01:42:23.362 --> 01:42:24.543]  Take the health care policy.
[01:42:24.543 --> 01:42:27.045]  That's the thing that's right on the table right now.
[01:42:27.045 --> 01:42:28.526]  Obamacare.
[01:42:28.526 --> 01:42:29.987]  And that is murderous.
[01:42:29.987 --> 01:42:31.309]  There's no question about it.
[01:42:31.309 --> 01:42:34.011]  It's mass murderous and intentionally so.
[01:42:34.011 --> 01:42:40.997]  It goes together with... Obama has always been, while president, has been close to the Queen of England.
[01:42:41.843 --> 01:42:54.662]  And the Queen of England has a standing policy now, which has been going on for some time, saying that we have to reduce the human population on this planet from seven billion people down to less than one.
[01:42:54.662 --> 01:42:56.665]  That is her avowed policy.
[01:42:57.651 --> 01:43:00.973]  Obama is an exponent of that same policy.
[01:43:00.973 --> 01:43:03.035]  He's a supporter of that same policy.
[01:43:03.035 --> 01:43:09.519]  As a matter of fact, his position as president was a result of the British Empire's support for him.
[01:43:09.519 --> 01:43:12.101]  The financing of his campaign and so forth.
[01:43:12.101 --> 01:43:15.403]  So this has been that policy all the way through.
[01:43:15.403 --> 01:43:18.706]  And the point was, is reduce the human population.
[01:43:18.706 --> 01:43:23.529]  If you actually go back earlier, it didn't really start with Obama.
[01:43:23.529 --> 01:43:26.191]  You go back to the death of, you know,
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:27.600]  I don't
[01:43:43.986 --> 01:43:49.090]  But the death of Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, opened up a new region.
[01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:58.036]  We got into this war in Indochina, which is a stupid thing to get into, which Mark McArthur had warned us against quite accurately.
[01:43:58.036 --> 01:44:02.118]  And this has gone step by step by step.
[01:44:02.118 --> 01:44:05.060]  If you look at the economy, the U.S.
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:11.325]  economy, in terms of per capita terms, in terms of other considerations, has been on a descent.
[01:44:12.361 --> 01:44:17.022]  Ever since the beginning of the war in Indochina.
[01:44:17.022 --> 01:44:22.004]  And it started really as a result of the Kennedy being assassinated.
[01:44:22.004 --> 01:44:28.886]  So from that time on, the people of the United States have been getting poorer and poorer and poorer.
[01:44:28.886 --> 01:44:38.289]  Sure, even before the 1992 Rio Summit where they called for a post-industrial world as the global policy and even thanked Ted Turner and Prince Philip
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:57.211]  And others were helping develop the strategy out of the Royal Commission on Population that they had adopted from from 1949 that I first learned about reading your publications and then went to the library and indeed was able to find that publication for Worldwide Eugenics, Cutting Off Resources and Genocide.
[01:44:57.211 --> 01:45:06.998]  Long before the term agenda 21 was coined at Rio, your writings, your researchers writings again documented
[01:45:08.007 --> 01:45:08.488]  Yes, there is.
[01:45:22.519 --> 01:45:26.241]  Well, you right now, you will probably notice that the U.S.
[01:45:26.241 --> 01:45:35.186]  population has been increasingly angry, the citizenry has been increasingly angry against Obama and wants him out of office.
[01:45:35.186 --> 01:45:38.648]  He manages by certain kinds of support to stay in office.
[01:45:38.648 --> 01:45:43.031]  He should have been expelled a long time ago for what he does.
[01:45:43.031 --> 01:45:44.332]  But that is going on.
[01:45:44.332 --> 01:45:48.795]  We are now in a position where, with this last legislation that he put through,
[01:45:49.795 --> 01:46:00.686]  He actually is condemning a great number of our people to death, early death, by his so-called health care policies and related economic policies which affect health care.
[01:46:00.686 --> 01:46:02.748]  His insurance policies.
[01:46:02.748 --> 01:46:04.830]  These things are mass murderers.
[01:46:04.830 --> 01:46:06.992]  This has been going on as a direction
[01:46:07.714 --> 01:46:10.796]  Ever since shortly after Kennedy was assassinated.
[01:46:10.796 --> 01:46:12.097]  And no one can deny it.
[01:46:12.097 --> 01:46:18.160]  Everything they're doing is to shut down small businesses, small farms, small factories, shutting down our power plants.
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:21.942]  They are completely engaging in warfare against the United States.
[01:46:21.942 --> 01:46:26.865]  What is the endgame strategy there, Mr. LaRouche?
[01:46:26.865 --> 01:46:30.207]  Well, the endgame strategy is the Queen's policy.
[01:46:30.207 --> 01:46:33.509]  The Queen of England has been the leader in this policy.
[01:46:34.210 --> 01:46:42.654]  Saying the necessity is to reduce the human population of the planet from 7 billion people approximately to less than 1.
[01:46:42.654 --> 01:46:43.915]  That's her policy.
[01:46:43.915 --> 01:46:45.936]  It's what she said again and again and again.
[01:46:45.936 --> 01:46:48.717]  That's the policy of her regime.
[01:46:48.717 --> 01:46:50.118]  Of the monarchy.
[01:46:50.118 --> 01:46:50.798]  Is genocide.
[01:46:51.909 --> 01:47:06.614]  So that Hitler was not new on this thing exactly, on genocide, but the Queen's policy is in accord with the population policies of Adolf Hitler in the early period of his regime.
[01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:21.125]  You were on early in the year, I think it was in January, people can pull it up, and you said, we're headed towards nuclear war with China and Russia, starting around Syria, and since then that's become the headlines, but the Obama regime has backed off for now.
[01:47:21.125 --> 01:47:23.226]  What's happening militarily?
[01:47:23.226 --> 01:47:31.373]  Well, the policy is, Russia has played an interesting role in this, because it seemed for a while that Russia has been power.
[01:47:33.758 --> 01:47:36.339]  I don't think it's a great power right now.
[01:47:36.339 --> 01:47:40.380]  I mean, it's on hard times in its own regime.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:48.343]  But its influence has been accepted by other governments as well as the Russian government itself.
[01:47:48.343 --> 01:47:52.204]  And its effects on China, for example, is watching this situation.
[01:47:52.204 --> 01:47:54.745]  Japan is aware of it and so forth.
[01:47:54.745 --> 01:47:57.166]  So we're aware that this problem exists.
[01:47:58.310 --> 01:48:18.702]  Let me put it this way clearly, if we don't throw Obama out of office soon, and there's every reason to throw him out of office, preemptively, he deserves to be thrown out of office, not only for his sake,
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:42.006]  But for the sake of our people in the United States, if his policies, as he's just put the new stage through into operation, if that policy is allowed, you're going to see open Hitler-style genocide applied to a large section of the population who is considered not fit to survive, not fit to live.
[01:48:44.901 --> 01:48:47.066]  And then meanwhile they're doing everything they can.
[01:48:47.066 --> 01:48:49.471]  I'm so unfit to live.
[01:48:49.471 --> 01:48:49.731]  Wow.
[01:48:49.731 --> 01:48:50.633]  And that's what he's done.
[01:48:50.633 --> 01:48:55.664]  That's what his legislation is right now on his new health care legislation.
[01:48:56.827 --> 01:48:57.688]  I know, I've read it.
[01:48:57.688 --> 01:48:59.949]  It's unbelievably Hitlerian, to say the least.
[01:48:59.949 --> 01:49:01.670]  It's Malthusian.
[01:49:01.670 --> 01:49:03.491]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:49:03.491 --> 01:49:06.934]  They're doing everything they can to block technological development, clean technologies.
[01:49:06.934 --> 01:49:12.457]  They want this neo-feudalistic system, as you say, under the British Crown on record.
[01:49:12.457 --> 01:49:13.858]  They developed the program.
[01:49:13.858 --> 01:49:18.841]  So it is their program that's being followed, whether they're completely running it or not.
[01:49:18.841 --> 01:49:21.923]  If this goes through, and they're able to carry this out,
[01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:38.853]  It's terrible, but I don't see their plan actually working, but I do see it causing a giant World War 3 type scenario as the world finally stands up against the people that run America and the UK, and I just can't believe we're going to allow ourselves to be the bad guys in this.
[01:49:38.853 --> 01:49:48.155]  I see the people standing up, and if we don't repudiate Obama and impeach him and arrest his minions, then it will set the precedent to allow them to continue the collision course towards World War 3.
[01:49:49.158 --> 01:49:55.301]  Well, you've got a situation now in which you can fairly say that you have the American population, the U.S.
[01:49:55.301 --> 01:50:01.683]  population, the citizens, are more and more enraged against Obama and want him out.
[01:50:01.683 --> 01:50:14.049]  Now, the thing that keeps... There are some people, including Democrats and so forth, some Democrats are guilty of this sort of thing, but the significant thing is that people in the main
[01:50:14.881 --> 01:50:19.083]  Except those who benefit from Wall Street.
[01:50:19.083 --> 01:50:21.745]  Wall Street is the only factor in the U.S.
[01:50:21.745 --> 01:50:25.567]  economy which really keeps Obama still in office.
[01:50:25.567 --> 01:50:29.009]  He couldn't have made it otherwise.
[01:50:29.009 --> 01:50:37.894]  So what you have across the nation, we have an explosion of determination, a rising tide of determination.
[01:50:37.894 --> 01:50:41.356]  Throw this guy out now while we're still alive.
[01:50:42.887 --> 01:50:44.728]  That's the mood out there.
[01:50:44.728 --> 01:50:46.608]  And it's increasing at a rapid rate.
[01:50:46.608 --> 01:50:53.911]  Well, I'm finishing my film, Obama Deception, too soon, and that's basically, while making the film, the summation I came to, he's not just another puppet.
[01:50:53.911 --> 01:51:09.576]  He cannot be allowed to stay in, because in another two years, he'll totally wreck us anyways, but regardless, we cannot allow them to commit all these crimes and not get in trouble, or the precedent's set to where we are a fascist regime, and now the banks are moving to keep people's money?
[01:51:09.576 --> 01:51:10.596]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[01:51:11.499 --> 01:51:14.400]  Well, that's what has been the intention all the way through.
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:29.584]  What has happened recently, as popular opinion in particular in this nation, has recognized that, and it's recognized that not only because of what is happening inside the United States, but they're recognizing what has been happening in Europe.
[01:51:29.584 --> 01:51:36.566]  The situation in Europe is much more advanced, in terms of pro-genocide trends, than in the United States yet.
[01:51:37.341 --> 01:51:44.209]  But we're going very rapidly in that direction, and Obama is the specific driver of that crime.
[01:51:44.209 --> 01:51:47.092]  I mean, this is a guy waiting for his Nuremberg trial.
[01:51:48.152 --> 01:51:50.774]  That's what this president is.
[01:51:50.774 --> 01:51:51.194]  Is he?
[01:51:51.194 --> 01:51:57.159]  I mean, I understand he's a figurehead of this whole takeover and enjoys it and is part of it.
[01:51:57.159 --> 01:52:01.422]  And I understand it's important to bring him down, to bring the whole corrupt cabal down.
[01:52:01.422 --> 01:52:11.489]  But specifically, a lot of top people I know, they say Obama is particularly evil and that he actually enjoys all this and that he is actually calling a lot of shots.
[01:52:11.489 --> 01:52:12.670]  Is that accurate or inaccurate?
[01:52:13.465 --> 01:52:15.846]  Sure it's accurate.
[01:52:15.846 --> 01:52:18.047]  You could express it in other ways.
[01:52:18.047 --> 01:52:27.311]  But from the standpoint of popular opinion, insofar as popular opinion has that view, the view is valid.
[01:52:27.311 --> 01:52:31.492]  Other key points.
[01:52:31.492 --> 01:52:36.334]  I would say that I'm concerned about getting back our laws.
[01:52:36.334 --> 01:52:39.135]  Because what we have now is not good.
[01:52:41.588 --> 01:52:43.972]  It is not something we should tolerate.
[01:52:43.972 --> 01:52:48.499]  We have to throw this government out of office now.
[01:52:48.499 --> 01:52:53.247]  Impeachment time, buzz and all, is due now.
[01:52:55.899 --> 01:52:57.160]  And that's an understatement.
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:01.225]  I mean, I cannot believe they're openly running torture ships off the coast.
[01:53:01.225 --> 01:53:05.650]  I can't believe they're openly training in army manuals.
[01:53:05.650 --> 01:53:07.412]  I'm sure you've seen this.
[01:53:07.412 --> 01:53:08.273]  This is official news.
[01:53:08.273 --> 01:53:14.059]  They actually badmouth the founding fathers and say they were bad people and they're training for war.
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:19.582]  Against anybody that is pro-national system, pro-liberty, pro-freedom.
[01:53:19.582 --> 01:53:21.502]  It's not even about left or right.
[01:53:21.502 --> 01:53:26.384]  I mean, it's cartoonish how officially authoritarian Obama is.
[01:53:26.384 --> 01:53:29.786]  I can't even believe that they're this out of control.
[01:53:29.786 --> 01:53:31.106]  They are out of control.
[01:53:31.106 --> 01:53:36.108]  But they are talking about something worse than Hitler.
[01:53:37.150 --> 01:53:42.153]  Hitler reached very terrible levels of abuses.
[01:53:42.153 --> 01:53:44.555]  But he didn't have 10,000 nuclear weapons.
[01:53:44.555 --> 01:53:45.996]  This is worse.
[01:53:45.996 --> 01:53:47.457]  How is it worse?
[01:53:47.457 --> 01:54:00.885]  What you're headed for, potentially, which is the only factor of restraint in terms of the international situation, is the fact that we were on the edge in the Syrian operation.
[01:54:00.885 --> 01:54:05.548]  We were on the edge of thermonuclear war, globally.
[01:54:06.835 --> 01:54:11.899]  Just take the situation of Russia, Russia's role in respect to Syria.
[01:54:11.899 --> 01:54:16.864]  Then you have the various kinds of operations back and forth on this sort of thing.
[01:54:16.864 --> 01:54:29.394]  And if you look at the history of Obama, with the crimes he's committed in office, publicly, and gotten by with that, you understand two things.
[01:54:29.394 --> 01:54:31.316]  First of all, that he's a criminal, really.
[01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:35.691]  By any standard of decency.
[01:54:35.691 --> 01:54:38.612]  And he's a great liar.
[01:54:38.612 --> 01:54:39.932]  Aren't they all so mad men?
[01:54:39.932 --> 01:54:49.535]  Because as you just stated, even General Dempsey, who's known as a pro-war guy most of the time, that's why they put him in, he went at midnight and told Obama, the military's not going to stand with you.
[01:54:49.535 --> 01:55:00.738]  And I'm not for military coups, but if it's stopping like Hitler, like Operation Valkyrie, at least non-violently, politically saying no, I have confirmed, it's even come out in the news, that the military basically blocked
[01:55:01.098 --> 01:55:06.304]  That operation a few weeks ago saying this will probably lead to nuclear war.
[01:55:06.304 --> 01:55:11.189]  So that shows me how insane the Anglo-American leaders are.
[01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.870]  Absolutely.
[01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:16.034]  That's understood internationally.
[01:55:16.034 --> 01:55:16.955]  That's what we are.
[01:55:16.955 --> 01:55:20.018]  This man must be thrown out of office.
[01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:23.852]  The time for impeachment, now.
[01:55:23.852 --> 01:55:26.254]  Summary impeachment, now.
[01:55:26.254 --> 01:55:27.635]  Sir, what about the other elites?
[01:55:27.635 --> 01:55:29.577]  Because I know you have your finger on the pulse.
[01:55:29.577 --> 01:55:31.558]  I mean, they're not all this insane, are they?
[01:55:31.558 --> 01:55:34.621]  I mean, why have they gotten so reckless?
[01:55:34.621 --> 01:55:37.463]  I mean, don't they know about Napoleon and Hitler and people?
[01:55:37.463 --> 01:55:50.013]  I mean, that's... I think with people who are Wall Street-oriented, generally, I think, are not exactly civilized, to put the kind of structure on it.
[01:55:51.204 --> 01:55:55.227]  And they're worried about my money.
[01:55:55.227 --> 01:55:55.848]  You get this.
[01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:59.291]  You get the whole Wall Street crowd.
[01:55:59.291 --> 01:56:00.011]  My money.
[01:56:00.011 --> 01:56:02.813]  And you have all the people that go along with it.
[01:56:02.813 --> 01:56:09.759]  Look, you've got Republicans, you know, going along with this their way.
[01:56:09.759 --> 01:56:16.684]  You have members of the Democratic Party, leaders in the Congress, who are pushing the same thing.
[01:56:16.684 --> 01:56:18.446]  So we're coming to a collision course.
[01:56:19.429 --> 01:56:29.093]  And the thing to worry about is are we going to have a bloody show inside the United States over this issue, this crime that's being committed under the leadership of Obama?
[01:56:29.093 --> 01:56:30.793]  Or are we going to stop it?
[01:56:30.793 --> 01:56:35.035]  Are we going to intervene and throw this guy out of office?
[01:56:35.035 --> 01:56:45.659]  Now if we throw him out of office, we will probably also do some things to some of these swindlers on Wall Street, who have ruined and are murdering people virtually with their policies.
[01:56:46.955 --> 01:56:50.734]  But we have to get back to our Constitution.
[01:56:51.488 --> 01:56:57.812]  This government is no longer operating on the basis of the federal constitution, but directly opposite to it.
[01:56:57.812 --> 01:56:59.593]  The time for impeachment is now.
[01:57:21.928 --> 01:57:25.010]  Because they're not even thinking about the larger ramifications.
[01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:28.972]  It's just a pure mindlessness, and it's not free market.
[01:57:28.972 --> 01:57:32.334]  It's backed up with taxpayer money, so they've been emboldened.
[01:57:32.334 --> 01:57:34.876]  They are insane.
[01:57:34.876 --> 01:57:41.460]  Well, this is sort of a Saudi-British operation, which is doing all this.
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:44.882]  Actually, 9-11 was a product of a Saudi-British operation.
[01:57:45.822 --> 01:57:52.224]  And they've got these special gags on people who know the facts about 9-11.
[01:57:52.224 --> 01:57:55.124]  But 9-11 was a part of this process.
[01:57:55.124 --> 01:57:59.425]  And it was a British-Saudi operation.
[01:57:59.425 --> 01:58:01.006]  And that's the fact.
[01:58:01.006 --> 01:58:05.527]  But the British government and the Saudis, they're not going to survive World War III.
[01:58:05.527 --> 01:58:09.087]  That is not an important question, I think.
[01:58:09.087 --> 01:58:15.029]  That's because the Saudis also can be dispensed with under certain conditions.
[01:58:15.962 --> 01:58:21.146]  No, the question is, this has, we have to bring, we have to deal with the economic question, the economic point.
[01:58:21.146 --> 01:58:23.788]  Okay, Lionel LaRouche, can you do five more minutes with us, sir?
[01:58:23.788 --> 01:58:24.168]  Sure.
[01:58:24.168 --> 01:58:27.771]  I've got to go to break for one minute, we'll start the next hour, and then we're going to get into some other issues.
[01:58:27.771 --> 01:58:31.894]  But man, I tell you, you hear all this stuff and it sounds wild, it's absolutely on target.
[01:58:31.894 --> 01:58:33.375]  And all I do is research this info.
[01:58:33.375 --> 01:58:35.697]  We are in so much danger, folks.
[01:58:35.697 --> 01:58:41.181]  I mean, the people running things are insane.

[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:21.523]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.908 --> 02:00:35.829]  Folks, Lennon LaRouche is our guest.
[02:00:35.829 --> 02:00:37.089]  LaRoucheFact.com.
[02:00:37.089 --> 02:00:44.371]  And I gotta tell ya, I probably read 100 history books or more by the time I was 12 years old, but the more you know, the more you don't know.
[02:00:44.371 --> 02:00:51.313]  And by the time I was probably 16, 17 and first saw their quarterly intelligence review and was reading it, I knew so much history.
[02:00:51.313 --> 02:00:52.954]  I was like, oh, I've read this, I've read that.
[02:00:52.954 --> 02:00:55.355]  It was like most of it I knew was accurate.
[02:00:55.355 --> 02:00:58.916]  The parts I didn't know was accurate, because I just didn't have the historical knowledge yet.
[02:00:58.916 --> 02:01:02.117]  It was gray area for me, because I hadn't discovered it separately for myself yet.
[02:01:02.717 --> 02:01:11.981]  But the way they put it all together and what they lay out is really helped me understand how the world works.
[02:01:11.981 --> 02:01:18.124]  And the funny part is from the John Birch Society angle, which people can claim is connected to whatever, they told a lot of the truth of what was going on.
[02:01:18.544 --> 02:01:21.425]  But I think when you get to the end of the day, there isn't really a left or right.
[02:01:21.425 --> 02:01:27.868]  There's, are you pro-humanity, pro-civilization, or are you pro-war economy, genocide, death control?
[02:01:27.868 --> 02:01:29.889]  We got four minutes left, Lyndon LaRouche.
[02:01:29.889 --> 02:01:31.049]  Thank you for your time.
[02:01:31.049 --> 02:01:38.753]  Make the point you were saying about what we need to do, solutions now, with the economy, ideas, how we stop this madness.
[02:01:38.753 --> 02:01:40.693]  First of all, impeach this president.
[02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:41.714]  That's the first thing you have to do.
[02:01:42.834 --> 02:01:47.356]  And the ability, the grounds for doing so, more than richly exists.
[02:01:47.356 --> 02:01:55.580]  Alright, then we have to think about how are we going to take the economy, for example, the European economy is collapsing.
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:02:00.683]  The transatlantic region is a disaster area, in terms of economy.
[02:02:00.683 --> 02:02:11.988]  My view is, I'll just summarize it this way, there's one thing we could do, and that is if we could start a program of recovery, which could be started now, with getting this guy out.
[02:02:13.235 --> 02:02:19.741]  We would then think of taking our middle of the United States, the Mississippi West area.
[02:02:19.741 --> 02:02:22.243]  We've lost our food supply.
[02:02:22.243 --> 02:02:28.268]  Our food supply has been destroyed by this operation, by these kinds of operations.
[02:02:28.268 --> 02:02:33.673]  So we've got, again, we've got to get the food supply in there, we've got to rebuild some of our economy.
[02:02:33.673 --> 02:02:38.717]  We don't have the ability to maintain our own population.
[02:02:38.717 --> 02:02:39.818]  That's what's happened.
[02:02:39.818 --> 02:02:40.519]  Now then what do we do?
[02:02:41.385 --> 02:02:48.603]  Well, we go across from the Asian region into Asia.
[02:02:48.603 --> 02:02:49.344]  We cross there.
[02:02:50.444 --> 02:02:56.210]  We restart again, thermonuclear fusion as a driver program.
[02:02:56.210 --> 02:03:02.055]  That is absolutely indispensable for the survival of civilization on the planet as a whole.
[02:03:02.055 --> 02:03:15.508]  It will take time to get there, probably ten years before we could actually... But giant peaceful Manhattan projects, advanced technologies, cleaner energies, R&D, the opposite of what the neo-feudalists want.
[02:03:16.749 --> 02:03:19.031]  Yes, well, there are very specific things.
[02:03:19.031 --> 02:03:35.085]  Thermonuclear fusion, which has been suppressed, we have a miniature version of thermonuclear fusion, which is now, but the actual, what is required as thermonuclear fusion to ensure the survival of ankyte on this planet.
[02:03:36.477 --> 02:03:38.238]  That is something we've got to get.
[02:03:38.238 --> 02:03:40.359]  But we have to start the program now.
[02:03:40.359 --> 02:03:41.500]  Get the program moving.
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:43.841]  A recovery program immediately.
[02:03:43.841 --> 02:03:45.141]  Throw Obama out.
[02:03:45.141 --> 02:03:48.103]  Agree to go ahead with a recovery program immediately.
[02:03:48.103 --> 02:03:52.345]  Get our food supply, which has been destroyed in the middle of the United States.
[02:03:52.345 --> 02:03:56.227]  And if we just back off from World War III, the whole world won't give a sigh of relief.
[02:03:56.227 --> 02:04:01.510]  It'll create confidence and investment and true globalism, people working together.
[02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.870]  Absolutely.
[02:04:02.836 --> 02:04:05.137]  It is possible.
[02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:07.238]  It's something I'm very much concerned about.
[02:04:07.238 --> 02:04:09.580]  My associates, for example, are involved with this.
[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:11.381]  We're concerned with this program.
[02:04:11.381 --> 02:04:18.645]  Thermonuclear fusion is an absolute requirement for the preservation of the human species.
[02:04:18.645 --> 02:04:19.525]  Okay, well, yes, sir.
[02:04:19.525 --> 02:04:21.986]  Thank you so much for your gracious time.

[02:04:23.087 --> 02:04:29.851]  Lennon LaRouche, are there other sites or other things you would point out for people to visit?
[02:04:29.851 --> 02:04:30.031]  Yes.
[02:04:32.972 --> 02:04:35.153]  I know that you've also got the publication site.
[02:04:35.153 --> 02:04:39.695]  People can link through right there at larouchepac.com.
[02:04:39.695 --> 02:04:44.237]  Thank you so much for the time.
[02:04:44.237 --> 02:04:46.218]  All right, we'll talk to him again in the future.
[02:04:46.218 --> 02:04:48.259]  Lenin LaRouche, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:48.259 --> 02:04:50.700]  That guy is really interesting.
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:51.900]  Reagan thought he was interesting.
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:53.381]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:53.381 --> 02:04:53.841]  Stay with us.

[02:05:06.642 --> 02:05:15.544]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.

[02:06:57.959 --> 02:06:58.820]  Others don't.
[02:06:59.997 --> 02:07:04.301]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[02:07:04.301 --> 02:07:10.187]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere, and the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[02:07:10.187 --> 02:07:15.993]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[02:07:15.993 --> 02:07:16.594]  Fortunately,

[02:08:12.679 --> 02:08:17.639]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:08:30.464 --> 02:08:42.509]  Well, they ignored it yesterday, but when the mighty, almighty, when it comes to news, DrugsReport.com made it their front-top mega-link today.
[02:08:42.509 --> 02:08:53.313]  At DrugsReport.com, they had to respond, and Chase Bank claims concern about capital controls is an overreaction.
[02:08:53.313 --> 02:08:58.935]  Financial analyst Salente calls new draconian measures unprecedented.
[02:09:00.171 --> 02:09:05.897]  Yeah, even from the perspective of your, like, Bank of America two years ago when they tried to put $5 fees to use your own debit card.
[02:09:05.897 --> 02:09:09.421]  Because, see, money's so worthless now they've devalued it so much.
[02:09:09.421 --> 02:09:13.786]  It's only good to get us to, you know, kill ourselves for them for peanuts.
[02:09:13.786 --> 02:09:15.628]  And they use taxes to control the economy.
[02:09:15.628 --> 02:09:18.952]  But above the real economy, that's only like $14-15 trillion a year here,
[02:09:21.294 --> 02:09:27.397]  There is the $100 trillion, $200 trillion North American derivatives market every year.
[02:09:27.397 --> 02:09:31.819]  And globally, $1.5 quadrillion total, just in overhang.
[02:09:31.819 --> 02:09:37.001]  They don't need the $100,000 you've been saving for 10 years for retirement.
[02:09:37.001 --> 02:09:38.282]  They don't need that anymore.
[02:09:39.170 --> 02:09:42.172]  And so they're saying, you're going to pay us basically to have money in our bank account.
[02:09:42.172 --> 02:09:43.413]  You're going to pay us to use it.
[02:09:43.413 --> 02:09:49.638]  But just from the angle of them saying, OK, all our business account holders, you can't wire money out of the country.
[02:09:49.638 --> 02:09:51.079]  You can only wire it in.
[02:09:51.079 --> 02:09:57.384]  And if you have cash transactions, period, that's not 50,000 at a time in a month or 50,000 over a month.
[02:09:57.384 --> 02:09:59.706]  It's most even small restaurants.
[02:10:01.004 --> 02:10:12.069]  I mean, I know people that own, like, taco shacks and stuff that make, like, $100,000 a month total in gross cash, because people tend to use, you know, a $5 bill for a couple tacos or whatever.
[02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:14.790]  Their profit might be 60 cents a taco.
[02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:18.671]  They're barely making it, working, you know, 12 hours a day running a taco shack.
[02:10:18.671 --> 02:10:21.452]  One of my friends, you know, does okay doing it.
[02:10:21.452 --> 02:10:24.714]  But he puts $100,000 a month in the deal.
[02:10:24.714 --> 02:10:28.055]  No, you're not going to be at Chase anymore.
[02:10:28.055 --> 02:10:29.596]  And it's worse than that, folks.
[02:10:30.672 --> 02:10:33.094]  Because other big banks, and I'm working on this right now.
[02:10:33.094 --> 02:10:37.497]  It'd already be a big national story, but I've been so busy I haven't... I've nailed it down, but I got to get the name straight.
[02:10:37.497 --> 02:10:38.898]  I got to get the authorization.
[02:10:38.898 --> 02:10:44.902]  I got a big breaking TSA story that I forgot to pull the trigger on this morning.
[02:10:44.902 --> 02:10:45.782]  It's so big.
[02:10:45.782 --> 02:10:49.065]  I should have pulled the trigger on it this morning.
[02:10:49.065 --> 02:10:49.965]  I dropped the ball.
[02:10:49.965 --> 02:10:53.648]  My problem is I got so many big stories coming in, I can't even keep track of it right now.
[02:10:55.038 --> 02:10:56.660]  I'll talk to Don Salazar during the break.
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:57.300]  He's been waiting.
[02:10:57.300 --> 02:10:58.522]  He was up here late last night working on it.
[02:10:58.522 --> 02:11:02.005]  He's been waiting all day for me to come approve it, and I need to proofread it.
[02:11:02.005 --> 02:11:03.887]  Not proofread it.
[02:11:03.887 --> 02:11:05.428]  He's a great writer, doesn't make typos.
[02:11:05.428 --> 02:11:07.711]  I mean, I've got to check because it's a secret source.
[02:11:07.711 --> 02:11:11.334]  I just want to look at it because it's a clandestine type deal.
[02:11:11.334 --> 02:11:16.499]  So just have him print me that actually, since it's not online yet, and I'll read it and then approve it.
[02:11:16.499 --> 02:11:18.101]  It should be ready by the bottom of the hour.
[02:11:18.101 --> 02:11:19.122]  Big TSA news.
[02:11:20.316 --> 02:11:22.617]  I mean, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
[02:11:22.617 --> 02:11:25.717]  I can't believe this is so insane.
[02:11:25.717 --> 02:11:31.679]  And what's dangerous is we are becoming like a major source because the mainstream media isn't real media.
[02:11:31.679 --> 02:11:33.159]  They won't report on anything.
[02:11:33.159 --> 02:11:35.059]  They won't ask real questions anymore.
[02:11:35.059 --> 02:11:36.100]  So people are coming to us.
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:37.720]  We're gonna go to our guest here.
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:40.741]  It's just that Chase is now responding.
[02:11:41.864 --> 02:11:43.765]  Uh, and saying it's no big deal that we're doing this.
[02:11:43.765 --> 02:12:07.056]  Well, just on the basis of the war on cash and the war on business owners, including businesses I know, I know people that are turning over tens of millions a year, that Chase is saying you're not going to be able to do wires, you're not going to be able to, uh, you know, be able to have cash with us, and we're going to charge you even when you try to get a fancy international account with us, still there's going to be restrictions.
[02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:16.495]  And then now, it's coming in that other big banks, people have called other big banks and they said, well, we weren't going to announce this yet, but the word is it's coming by December.
[02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:21.898]  Chase is just doing it earlier, testing the whole thing on the 17th of November.
[02:12:21.898 --> 02:12:25.660]  And so this just absolutely illustrates a very serious situation.
[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:28.702]  I haven't gotten to Obama's bombshell statements from earlier.
[02:12:28.702 --> 02:12:30.583]  We'll do this after we talk to some guests that are coming up.
[02:12:31.343 --> 02:12:39.297]  Obama came out this morning, while I was live in the first hour, and said, talk radio, don't listen to them, don't listen to alternative press.
[02:12:39.297 --> 02:12:44.626]  Obama says ignore bloggers, activists, and radio talk show hosts demanding fiscal sanity.
[02:12:45.886 --> 02:12:47.007]  Unbelievable.
[02:12:47.007 --> 02:12:48.967]  It's a war on the real press.
[02:12:48.967 --> 02:12:51.348]  That's a Curt Nemo article.
[02:12:51.348 --> 02:12:54.050]  Again, just absolutely insane.
[02:12:54.050 --> 02:12:58.732]  But update, Chase Bank limits withdrawals, bans international wire transfers.
[02:12:58.732 --> 02:12:59.832]  Drudge has the headline now.
[02:12:59.832 --> 02:13:01.293]  It's moving to the right-hand side.
[02:13:01.293 --> 02:13:03.814]  Chase fees on cash, limits withdrawals on some accounts.
[02:13:04.574 --> 02:13:04.915]  U.S.
[02:13:04.915 --> 02:13:07.119]  watchings for signs of Israeli strike on Iran.
[02:13:07.119 --> 02:13:10.345]  I mean, this is just the insanity we're dealing with.
[02:13:10.345 --> 02:13:14.854]  We'll add that update to the article that's on Drudge, where Chase is now responding.
[02:13:14.854 --> 02:13:15.856]  I want to shift gears now.
[02:13:17.130 --> 02:13:25.218]  To Murdoch Pisgati, DontComply.com, which is a great alternative liberty-minded news site.
[02:13:25.218 --> 02:13:34.807]  And he's the guy taking on the volunteer effort to honcho the thousands of patriots that are set to show up down in San Antonio.
[02:13:34.807 --> 02:13:35.988]  You know, I don't do a lot of speeches.
[02:13:35.988 --> 02:13:37.009]  I don't go out in public a lot.
[02:13:37.009 --> 02:13:37.450]  I'm busy.
[02:13:37.450 --> 02:13:39.211]  I do digital media.
[02:13:39.972 --> 02:13:43.433]  But I'm going to San Antonio to go down there and cover it.
[02:13:43.433 --> 02:13:47.474]  Jakari Jackson, David Knight, and others are going down there at 10 o'clock a.m.
[02:13:47.474 --> 02:13:52.615]  this Saturday in San Antonio in front of the Alamo.
[02:13:52.615 --> 02:13:55.895]  Because this is the real God-given civil rights movement.
[02:13:55.895 --> 02:13:57.536]  Sitting at the front of the bus, that's civil rights.
[02:13:57.536 --> 02:14:02.357]  Going in and saying, I'm going to eat at the lunch counter, forcing criminal laws to be repealed, that's what we're talking about.
[02:14:02.357 --> 02:14:07.418]  In this case, Gandhi marching to the sea to collect salt that was illegal, he had to buy it from the British government.
[02:14:08.418 --> 02:14:12.262]  Texas, it's legal to open carry a rifle, not a handgun, folks.
[02:14:12.262 --> 02:14:14.523]  I wouldn't bring those unless you're concealed carry.
[02:14:14.523 --> 02:14:15.784]  That's got to be concealed.
[02:14:15.784 --> 02:14:18.247]  We're trying to get that law repealed because that's unconstitutional.
[02:14:18.247 --> 02:14:22.210]  But they've been arresting people like Master Sergeant C.J.
[02:14:22.210 --> 02:14:23.331]  Grisham is going to be popping in.
[02:14:23.331 --> 02:14:34.040]  He's in court right now with the criminal charges of legally carrying his M4 with his son on a rural road for his, I guess it was Eagle Scout or whatever badges.
[02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:36.703]  So we've got that going on.
[02:14:36.703 --> 02:14:39.747]  I want to be able to walk down by my ranch.
[02:14:39.747 --> 02:14:42.270]  The cops pull over and freak out on you in East Texas now.
[02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:43.992]  You don't walk around with a gun in Texas.
[02:14:43.992 --> 02:14:47.617]  People think we're so free, we're actually pathetic, compared to places like Arizona.
[02:14:47.617 --> 02:14:52.323]  I'll just be honest, I love Texas, folks, but I've been, the only time I've been here since before it was Texas with Mexican land grants.
[02:14:52.924 --> 02:14:53.785]  So that's going on.
[02:14:53.785 --> 02:14:54.606]  He's going to be down there.
[02:14:54.606 --> 02:15:02.173]  You're going to have the land commissioner who called the police chief's bluff and said, look, it's illegal for you to say people can't have guns.
[02:15:02.173 --> 02:15:04.135]  Plus the Alamo state property.
[02:15:04.135 --> 02:15:05.656]  I say I'm over that.
[02:15:05.656 --> 02:15:07.358]  They can be on the Alamo property.
[02:15:07.358 --> 02:15:08.699]  So the police chief backed off.
[02:15:08.699 --> 02:15:11.381]  He was in the paper yesterday and he said, oh, we're.
[02:15:12.362 --> 02:15:15.925]  We're not enemies with the gun owners, we're all on the same side.
[02:15:15.925 --> 02:15:16.665]  Good!
[02:15:16.665 --> 02:15:24.031]  We force you to do the right thing and say you're with the Second Amendment, you're with the law, you're with George Washington, you're with Colonel Travis.
[02:15:24.031 --> 02:15:34.098]  Because 1776 started when they came to take the guns, and 1836 started when they came to take the guns at Gonzales and Goliad and other places.
[02:15:34.098 --> 02:15:39.683]  And up in Northeast Texas where Travis took on a bunch of people and beat them, so they said, you're colonel, go on down there.
[02:15:39.683 --> 02:15:40.863]  And the Mexican government had a bunch of
[02:15:42.204 --> 02:15:47.746]  Uh, Anglo, uh, mercenary enforcers, too, that Travis and others helped take out.
[02:15:47.746 --> 02:15:51.407]  And the media won't tell you Hispanics were about a third of the revolution against Santa Ana.
[02:15:51.407 --> 02:15:52.688]  They don't want everybody to come together.
[02:15:52.688 --> 02:15:56.389]  This is for everybody this Saturday, for the Second Amendment non-political.
[02:15:56.909 --> 02:15:59.590]  And we want to bring up Murdoch Pisgati.
[02:15:59.590 --> 02:16:01.811]  Good job at DontComply.com, buddy.
[02:16:01.811 --> 02:16:04.232]  Tell us what's coming up this Saturday at 10 a.m.
[02:16:04.232 --> 02:16:05.452]  in front of the Alamo.
[02:16:05.452 --> 02:16:06.653]  The line in the sand there.
[02:16:06.653 --> 02:16:10.134]  Again, we've already made them back off by forcing the issue.
[02:16:10.134 --> 02:16:12.115]  We salute you, buddy.
[02:16:12.115 --> 02:16:15.656]  Tell us what's coming up with the event that you've organized and are hot showing.
[02:16:15.656 --> 02:16:16.557]  Yeah.
[02:16:16.557 --> 02:16:17.937]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:17.937 --> 02:16:19.078]  I'm happy to be on the show.
[02:16:19.078 --> 02:16:22.219]  We're real excited about this event this weekend.
[02:16:22.219 --> 02:16:24.680]  To be at an event with this many people,
[02:16:26.228 --> 02:16:29.071]  Like-minded Patriots is just going to be amazing.
[02:16:29.071 --> 02:16:30.312]  Everyone should come on out.
[02:16:30.312 --> 02:16:31.933]  It's going to be from 10 to 2 o'clock.
[02:16:31.933 --> 02:16:46.965]  We're going to have some great speakers lined up and we're going to be there all exercising our Tech Amendment rights and showing the police and the public that we can open carry, that we can be responsible, law-abiding gun owners.
[02:16:46.965 --> 02:16:50.128]  And so everybody needs to come out.
[02:16:50.128 --> 02:16:50.448]  We've got
[02:16:51.028 --> 02:16:55.852]  Safety crews in place doing chamber checks for anyone that has any concerns on that.
[02:16:55.852 --> 02:16:59.194]  There's going to be escorts from the nearby parking garages.
[02:16:59.194 --> 02:17:01.596]  Look for the guys with the reflective armbands.
[02:17:01.596 --> 02:17:03.978]  It's going to be a real family-oriented event.
[02:17:03.978 --> 02:17:04.939]  It's going to be safe.
[02:17:04.939 --> 02:17:08.742]  Everybody should come out and bring their family, friends, and co-workers.
[02:17:09.511 --> 02:17:15.334]  Sure, and it's important to do all these safety checks and stuff because we're at the highest level of safety and standards.
[02:17:15.334 --> 02:17:23.759]  Just like concealed carry holders have the lowest crime rates and frustrate crimes now 44 times, I think the number is, for every time a gun's used in a crime.
[02:17:23.759 --> 02:17:26.241]  So we're absolutely turning the tide against the crime.
[02:17:26.241 --> 02:17:27.482]  Crime down 49%.
[02:17:27.482 --> 02:17:31.224]  Give us a list of speakers and the itinerary and tell us about the march that's coming up.
[02:17:32.406 --> 02:17:33.507]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:17:33.507 --> 02:17:50.976]  We've got everybody from Jerry Patterson, Dwayne Duvall, Matt McCall, Mike Vanderbough, CJ Grisham's going to be there speaking, as well as myself, as well as you, Alex, and Kathy Glass, Jay Stang, Stuart Rhodes, and
[02:17:52.561 --> 02:18:02.287]  I believe Stuart Rhodes is going to give a little time to one of the WWII veterans and let him have a little time on stage as well.
[02:18:02.287 --> 02:18:07.471]  There about 12.30 we're going to take the whole crowd and direct everybody towards Travis Park.
[02:18:08.426 --> 02:18:12.367]  And we're going to march that way under weight of arms.
[02:18:12.367 --> 02:18:23.111]  And once we get there, we're going to have kind of a little town hall meeting where everybody's going to get a minute to kind of say what's on their mind and just kind of gather around there in the park under the statue.
[02:18:23.111 --> 02:18:29.933]  And we're going to then take the tour down by one of the police stations and circle back around towards the Alamo.
[02:18:31.098 --> 02:18:34.600]  Unbelievably American, pro-human, pro-liberty.
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:40.063]  The example of what this country's really founded on and human liberty throughout the ages, what humans have fought for.
[02:18:40.063 --> 02:18:46.926]  This is a non-partisan, everybody's invited who supports liberty and supports freedom.
[02:18:46.926 --> 02:18:50.248]  Everybody needs to come out to this and even if you're not in Texas and can't make it.
[02:18:50.988 --> 02:18:59.912]  InfoWars Nightly News will have big excerpts of the stump speeches, that's what I really want to hear, of all the average folks that are out there, because you guys are my heroes.
[02:18:59.912 --> 02:19:04.514]  People that are doing open carry are the true Rosa Parks of our age.
[02:19:04.514 --> 02:19:10.756]  You are showing that the Second Amendment exists, and it's not dirty, it's not bad, and a right knot exercise is like a muscle.
[02:19:10.756 --> 02:19:13.257]  It isn't a muscle, it's atrophied, it's paralyzed.
[02:19:13.257 --> 02:19:19.560]  You are breathing life back into the Republic, Murdoch, and we salute you and everybody else involved in heading up these organizations.
[02:19:20.305 --> 02:19:21.125]  Thank you very much.
[02:19:21.125 --> 02:19:36.152]  You know, our goals of educating the public and the police on the current laws have been going so well that we've now moved on to our next goal of changing the current laws in Texas to reflect, you know, the true intention of the Second Amendment, where states shall not be infringed.
[02:19:36.152 --> 02:19:40.474]  And, you know, and as we run into resistance in certain towns, like San Antonio, well,
[02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:45.705]  Then we organize an event like this, come and take it San Antonio, line in the sand.
[02:19:45.705 --> 02:19:48.928]  And we show them that it shall not be infringed.
[02:19:48.928 --> 02:19:49.729]  Well said!
[02:19:49.729 --> 02:19:52.712]  Alright, Murdoch, Pisgati, great to have you on with us.
[02:19:52.712 --> 02:19:54.054]  Look forward to meeting you down there.
[02:19:54.054 --> 02:19:56.757]  We'll be right back with more of the folks that are involved in this.
[02:19:56.757 --> 02:19:57.718]  It's historic.
[02:19:57.718 --> 02:19:58.218]  Stay with us.
[02:19:58.218 --> 02:19:59.059]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:59.059 --> 02:19:59.640]  We're on the march.
[02:20:01.917 --> 02:20:09.641]  That's the sound of a .44 Magnum and TraumaMaxx, a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof vest from InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:20:09.641 --> 02:20:12.142]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.
[02:20:12.142 --> 02:20:16.904]  TraumaMaxx is a major breakthrough in pistol-rated body armor and prices start at just $170 per insert.
[02:20:18.965 --> 02:20:19.886]  More protection.
[02:20:19.886 --> 02:20:20.986]  More stopping power.
[02:20:20.986 --> 02:20:22.147]  More mobility.
[02:20:22.147 --> 02:20:24.208]  And it weighs less than 5 pounds.
[02:20:24.208 --> 02:20:26.830]  Get details at InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[02:23:00.425 --> 02:23:02.826]  Not all protein powders are created equal.

[02:23:55.610 --> 02:24:04.374]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:24:04.374 --> 02:24:15.359]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[02:24:17.875 --> 02:24:20.821]  But nobody wants to know him.
[02:24:20.821 --> 02:24:23.006]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[02:24:24.602 --> 02:24:34.605]  Well, she got that breaking TSA news that Little Bird told us about in the federal record.
[02:24:34.605 --> 02:24:39.946]  It will be breaking on air coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:39.946 --> 02:24:42.667]  This is breaking news that is bombshell.
[02:24:42.667 --> 02:24:45.288]  You think our JPMorgan Chase story is bombshell?
[02:24:45.288 --> 02:24:47.708]  This is as bombshell.
[02:24:47.708 --> 02:24:50.049]  I cannot believe we are the source for all this stuff.
[02:24:50.849 --> 02:24:55.311]  Uh, let's go to, uh, Terry Holcomb, a great guy who's been in studio several times.
[02:24:55.311 --> 02:24:57.072]  He heads up texascarry.org.
[02:24:57.072 --> 02:25:03.895]  And we're gonna try to get CJ Grisham on, who's in court right now for carrying a rifle loaded in a rural area with his son.
[02:25:03.895 --> 02:25:06.677]  The police just said, we don't care, and arrested him on video.
[02:25:06.677 --> 02:25:08.738]  That's got like 9 million views or something on YouTube.
[02:25:09.578 --> 02:25:10.459]  So he's a real hero.
[02:25:10.459 --> 02:25:12.279]  He's an active duty master sergeant.
[02:25:12.279 --> 02:25:14.460]  We ought to get him on sometime to tell war stories.
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:16.121]  Man, that guy has seen so much combat.
[02:25:16.121 --> 02:25:17.622]  It's so highly decorated.
[02:25:17.622 --> 02:25:23.885]  I would really like, just not wanting to hear about blood and guts, but how interesting it is, 19 years in the U.S.
[02:25:23.885 --> 02:25:30.368]  Army, because I've got family that's been in the Army that long and are similar rank to him, but in special operations they won't tell me anything.
[02:25:30.368 --> 02:25:30.748]  They say it's
[02:25:31.610 --> 02:25:36.452]  Anyway, side issue, they say it's national security, but I bet a regular army sergeant could tell us some stories.
[02:25:36.452 --> 02:25:40.054]  Going to Terry Holcomb, texascarry.org, buddy, this is a big deal.
[02:25:40.054 --> 02:25:52.459]  I'm really excited about the fact that the police did the right thing and basically told the police chief that they weren't going to be part of arresting people for legal stuff, and that now the police chief says that, quote, we're all on the same side.
[02:25:52.459 --> 02:25:53.560]  That's a victory.
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:58.582]  That's what you guys are trying to do, is just normalize what is already our God-given right and what's already law.
[02:25:59.521 --> 02:26:00.762]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[02:26:00.762 --> 02:26:01.703]  And that's true.
[02:26:01.703 --> 02:26:05.466]  This is a small victory and a very big battle.
[02:26:05.466 --> 02:26:20.637]  While we're all excited about the progress we're making in San Antonio, I'm not real convinced that I agree with, you know, Chief McManus that this isn't, as he quoted, an us versus them because, you know, the city ordinances in San Antonio are still in place.
[02:26:20.637 --> 02:26:23.599]  They are 100% unlawful.
[02:26:23.599 --> 02:26:27.542]  They go above and beyond the local government code, which we know is against the law.
[02:26:28.317 --> 02:26:37.266]  And they haven't repealed those yet, so I'm not, I mean, no, this is a great victory and we're excited about it and they basically have no choice but to follow the law Saturday.
[02:26:37.266 --> 02:26:38.287]  We still have a lot of work to do.
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:43.901]  Exactly, but I'm saying like Gandhi marching to the sea, it was illegal for people to collect salt.
[02:26:43.901 --> 02:26:46.781]  They had to buy it from the British government at exorbitant prices.
[02:26:46.781 --> 02:26:52.403]  When hundreds of thousands marched with him, starting only as a few, and gathered the salt, that was the beginning of the end.
[02:26:52.403 --> 02:26:58.124]  Just pointing out that we called your bluff, there is a second amendment, and making them back off.
[02:26:58.124 --> 02:27:00.284]  Thousands need to show up tomorrow.
[02:27:00.284 --> 02:27:04.085]  This is the spirit, this is the idea that will turn the tide.
[02:27:04.645 --> 02:27:07.146]  And we have people coming from all over the country.
[02:27:07.146 --> 02:27:08.386]  Not just here in Texas.
[02:27:08.386 --> 02:27:10.546]  We're getting support nationally.
[02:27:10.546 --> 02:27:12.447]  And it is a very exciting thing.
[02:27:12.447 --> 02:27:15.928]  And we're all waiting to hear on CJ's verdict.
[02:27:15.928 --> 02:27:18.868]  Everybody's sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for the jury to come out.
[02:27:18.868 --> 02:27:20.409]  So we're excited about that as well.
[02:27:20.409 --> 02:27:22.789]  And then we've got to take the battle to Austin.
[02:27:22.789 --> 02:27:27.170]  We're going to have to go to the Capitol and deal with the lawless DPS up there.
[02:27:27.170 --> 02:27:29.251]  And we're going to have to do this all over again.
[02:27:30.691 --> 02:27:33.012]  Well, you know, I was just thinking about C.J.
[02:27:33.012 --> 02:27:35.793]  Grisham and how much I admire him.
[02:27:35.793 --> 02:27:50.261]  Of all the battlefields he's been on, supposedly for this country, some good wars, some bad, he's now for America facing jail time for doing something legally and lawfully with his son for a merit badge in the middle of nowhere marching through the countryside.
[02:27:50.261 --> 02:27:52.782]  He's standing up in America for our rights.
[02:27:52.782 --> 02:27:54.162]  He's a true hero.
[02:27:54.162 --> 02:27:54.723]  He is.
[02:27:54.723 --> 02:27:58.625]  And C.J., you know, this is so fitting to have C.J.
[02:27:58.625 --> 02:27:59.305]  at the Alamo.
[02:28:00.115 --> 02:28:08.081]  He is the spirit of the Alamo, and he is a true modern-day Texas patriot that is putting it all on the line.
[02:28:08.081 --> 02:28:20.509]  Too many people, you know, sit out there and complain and want to do things on the computer, and CJ is out there fighting the fight, putting everything at risk, putting it all on the line for everyone's freedom.
[02:28:20.509 --> 02:28:24.672]  And I have the utmost admiration and respect for CJ.
[02:28:24.672 --> 02:28:26.753]  Yeah, he's facing some serious jail time.
[02:28:26.753 --> 02:28:28.294]  Tell us the details of that.
[02:28:29.639 --> 02:28:36.065]  Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, they charged him and they changed the charge so many times that it's hard to keep up with it.
[02:28:36.065 --> 02:28:44.113]  But it's either rudely displaying a weapon or it was resisting arrest at the beginning, but they knew that was never going to fly.
[02:28:44.113 --> 02:28:47.316]  So they changed it and then they changed it again.
[02:28:47.316 --> 02:28:54.603]  And so I'm pretty sure that the end charge was rudely displaying or resisting arrest or search or something like that.
[02:28:55.771 --> 02:28:57.472]  We're confident he's going to get off.
[02:28:57.472 --> 02:29:00.253]  We're confident that the jury's going to acquit him.
[02:29:00.253 --> 02:29:04.094]  But this is just evidence of things that are going on all over the state.
[02:29:04.094 --> 02:29:05.995]  This isn't isolated.
[02:29:05.995 --> 02:29:07.195]  This happened in McAllen.
[02:29:07.195 --> 02:29:08.315]  This happened in Temple.
[02:29:08.315 --> 02:29:09.936]  This is happening in San Antonio.
[02:29:09.936 --> 02:29:15.658]  Listen, we've got a ranch we've had since like 1829, when this was Mexico.
[02:29:15.658 --> 02:29:19.980]  And they now send game wardens in off-season to demand a look at our guns.
[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:22.801]  And if you walk down the street with a shotgun, they harass you.
[02:29:22.801 --> 02:29:23.761]  And this country's in trouble.
[02:29:24.454 --> 02:29:29.597]  This country is in real trouble, and this Second Amendment battle is a real battle.
[02:29:29.597 --> 02:29:32.219]  It's not... People misplace it.
[02:29:32.219 --> 02:29:35.421]  There's a lot of pro-gun people out there that are not Second Amendment.
[02:29:35.421 --> 02:29:37.162]  They don't believe in liberty and freedom.
[02:29:37.162 --> 02:29:37.502]  That's right.
[02:29:37.502 --> 02:29:40.044]  We either get on the offense and take it back, or we're gonna lose everything.
[02:29:40.044 --> 02:29:40.764]  Stay there.
[02:29:40.764 --> 02:29:46.568]  I've got a special report coming up, too, that Jakari did with David Knight on Mr. Grisham.
[02:29:46.568 --> 02:29:48.789]  We'll see if he comes out any time now and joins us.
[02:29:48.789 --> 02:29:50.050]  But stay there.
[02:29:50.050 --> 02:29:51.431]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.431 --> 02:29:52.952]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:33:30.399 --> 02:33:50.293]  We're going to finish up here with Terry Holcomb of Texas TXCarry.org and then CJ Grisham is in court right now waiting for the jury to come back on whether he's gonna I guess go to jail for years for legally carrying a M4 semi-auto strapped to his chest without a round in the chamber totally legal lawful with his son.
[02:33:50.293 --> 02:33:53.316]  Cops pulled up got in his face took him to jail
[02:33:54.449 --> 02:33:57.050]  And they're very proud of themselves because only they can have guns.
[02:33:57.050 --> 02:33:59.331]  Everybody else is just a slave.
[02:33:59.331 --> 02:34:04.073]  I know most police I know are actually disgusted by activity like this, but we got to push back or it's only going to get worse.
[02:34:04.073 --> 02:34:09.055]  And then after our guest leaves us, we're going to play a special short report with C.J.
[02:34:09.055 --> 02:34:13.057]  Grisham, who I do think is the, you know, the hero of this whole thing.
[02:34:13.057 --> 02:34:13.777]  People like him.
[02:34:13.777 --> 02:34:16.959]  Austinites getting arrested as well for legal lawful guns downtown.
[02:34:18.399 --> 02:34:41.951]  State police knowing it was a set rally with the Texas Historical Committee even on top of it and their thing was I don't care we're taking you to jail so we're gonna get updates from Terry Holcomb on that as well because he's going through through all this as well and has been in studio with us breaking down what's going on with his group but internal TSA documents body scanners pat-downs not for terrorists
[02:34:42.831 --> 02:34:49.573]  And these are internal TSA documents that have come out in court and then been posted to the federal court websites.
[02:34:49.573 --> 02:34:51.074]  No one picked this up.
[02:34:51.074 --> 02:34:52.514]  We picked it up.
[02:34:52.514 --> 02:34:58.016]  And TSA's administrative record admits invasive security procedures are ineffective and security theater.
[02:34:58.016 --> 02:34:59.016]  We have the quotes.
[02:34:59.016 --> 02:35:01.437]  This is them admitting all of it is not for terrorists.
[02:35:02.179 --> 02:35:05.920]  But as a federal power grab, bombshell, InfoWars.com.
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:08.841]  It's going up on PrisonPlanet.com right now as well.

[02:35:19.824 --> 02:35:21.264]  Going back to Terry Holcomb.
[02:35:21.264 --> 02:35:25.165]  Terry, other points you'd like to make about the arrests that were made in Austin?
[02:35:25.165 --> 02:35:27.926]  Where all that's going in the civil rights movement of the Second Amendment?
[02:35:28.482 --> 02:35:40.274]  And of course we had two veterans, you know, Scott Liberty and Gary Hayes, and then myself, which were arrested at the Capitol for carrying, open carrying pre-1899 replica black powder revolvers.
[02:35:40.274 --> 02:35:44.898]  All of us, they haven't even charged Gary Hayes yet, so they're playing hide and seek with him.
[02:35:44.898 --> 02:35:52.886]  And then with myself and Scott Liberty, we both showed up to pretrial hearings two Fridays ago, and the DA's haven't even filed a case yet, so they're playing cat and mouse with us as well.
[02:35:53.900 --> 02:35:58.823]  And so we're rescheduled and we're going to continue to fight that battle and we're going to win.
[02:35:58.823 --> 02:36:02.705]  We have the Attorney General's office working on these things as well.
[02:36:02.705 --> 02:36:09.729]  They're going to be getting some opinions out on some of these disorderly conduct codes that law enforcement is unlawfully using.
[02:36:10.191 --> 02:36:18.053]  And by the way, the administrators in Austin, they're not all bad, but a lot of them are hardcore Democratic Party operatives, that's on record.
[02:36:18.053 --> 02:36:32.497]  I've read about them doing stuff like, they'll never let you know and then they'll wait a year or two to the statute of limitations, they'll file it the week before and send it to a wrong address on purpose so that you can't respond and then claim that you're absconding.
[02:36:32.497 --> 02:36:34.058]  I mean, they'll try all sorts of dirty tricks.
[02:36:34.965 --> 02:36:36.226]  And we're all on top of that.
[02:36:36.226 --> 02:36:37.947]  We're keeping a very close eye on it.
[02:36:37.947 --> 02:36:40.689]  Our legal defense teams are keeping a very close eye on that.
[02:36:40.689 --> 02:36:42.310]  They're not going to get over on us.
[02:36:42.310 --> 02:36:44.612]  We're more than prepared for them.
[02:36:44.612 --> 02:36:45.552]  We're not going to go away.
[02:36:45.552 --> 02:36:46.573]  We're not going to back down.
[02:36:46.573 --> 02:36:49.395]  We're not going to shut up, and we're not going to sit down.
[02:36:49.395 --> 02:36:59.682]  We're coming at them with everything that we have, and if they want to continue these unlawful acts, we'll be more than happy to oblige them in the battle.
[02:36:59.682 --> 02:37:01.083]  You know, again, I want to
[02:37:01.687 --> 02:37:02.368]  Thank C.J.
[02:37:02.368 --> 02:37:03.128]  Grisham.
[02:37:03.128 --> 02:37:12.915]  I want to thank all the patriots that are out there fighting this fight in San Antonio, October the 19th, this Saturday at 10 a.m.
[02:37:12.915 --> 02:37:14.676]  You know, draw a line in the sand event.
[02:37:14.676 --> 02:37:22.042]  You know, we're going to be there lawfully exercising our rights and we're going to show up by well over a thousand people are going to be there.
[02:37:22.042 --> 02:37:25.524]  And this is a movement that came out of C.J.'
[02:37:25.484 --> 02:37:29.907]  's arrest and it's a movement that's going to continue until we win.
[02:37:29.907 --> 02:37:30.668]  The legislators
[02:37:31.368 --> 02:37:35.589]  Need to pay attention because we're not going to stop and we're not going to give up.
[02:37:35.589 --> 02:37:38.470]  And by the way, for folks that don't know, I've studied this historically.
[02:37:38.470 --> 02:37:39.830]  This isn't hype.
[02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:42.451]  This is Lexington Concord level.
[02:37:42.451 --> 02:37:43.631]  This is Alamo level.
[02:37:43.631 --> 02:37:45.952]  This is the stuff that led up to things like that.
[02:37:45.952 --> 02:37:49.993]  If we don't exercise this openly, this is what I'm going to speak briefly about at the event.
[02:37:49.993 --> 02:37:52.694]  I'm mainly there to film people because I want to put it in Obama Deception 2.
[02:37:55.464 --> 02:38:01.287]  If we don't peacefully exercise these rights now, these scoundrels are going to start a civil war and come after us.
[02:38:01.287 --> 02:38:08.270]  We have a responsibility to try to peacefully exercise these rights before they actually try to drop the hammer on everybody.
[02:38:08.270 --> 02:38:12.712]  And for most pro-gun people, they are just pro-gun and like guns.
[02:38:12.712 --> 02:38:18.715]  They're not actual Second Amendment people, and they're not doing their duty that was paid for with literally
[02:38:19.295 --> 02:38:34.366]  Millions of gallons of blood not just here but all over the world by people that have died so they can be armed and not be slaves and defend themselves and this is so historic that the war against the British crown that never been beaten started when they came to take the guns of the colonies.
[02:38:34.366 --> 02:38:35.647]  People were happy under
[02:38:36.568 --> 02:38:51.606]  The Mexican government until the dictator Santa Ana took over and was trying to enslave everybody and had a bunch of mainly criminals out of the United States that he hired to go around robbing people and tax collecting.
[02:38:51.606 --> 02:38:55.670]  That was actually his main force was actually out of other states, not even out of Mexico.
[02:38:56.531 --> 02:39:03.474]  And they have so distorted history on that, and they came to take the guns, and at first it was, don't have your guns in town, don't be public.
[02:39:03.474 --> 02:39:04.654]  In fact, that's what they first said.
[02:39:04.654 --> 02:39:05.895]  You can have them at your ranch house.
[02:39:05.895 --> 02:39:08.456]  And then it was, now you can't have guns, period.
[02:39:08.456 --> 02:39:11.377]  Well, people needed those just to live and defend themselves and hunt.
[02:39:11.377 --> 02:39:12.798]  It's the same story.
[02:39:12.798 --> 02:39:18.820]  We think of William Travis and all them as these legendary characters, and they were just because they wouldn't back down.
[02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:20.881]  And we think of Sam Houston and George Washington.
[02:39:21.921 --> 02:39:26.503]  We are their descendants spiritually, if not even physically.
[02:39:26.503 --> 02:39:28.424]  We must now stand.
[02:39:28.424 --> 02:39:32.366]  So when people tell me I'm a hero, I get upset by it.
[02:39:32.366 --> 02:39:35.707]  I think you are a hero once you've been arrested and are going through this, you yourself.
[02:39:35.707 --> 02:39:37.588]  But the point is, I'm not a hero.
[02:39:37.588 --> 02:39:39.049]  I'm trying to stop total takeover.
[02:39:39.449 --> 02:39:41.030]  I'm actually covering my butt.
[02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:43.651]  I'm actually trying to preserve my future and my children.
[02:39:43.651 --> 02:39:45.432]  I'm not doing this because I'm some hero.
[02:39:45.432 --> 02:39:47.053]  I don't particularly like having to do it.
[02:39:47.053 --> 02:39:50.535]  But I understand if I don't, it's a hundred times worse for my children.
[02:39:50.535 --> 02:39:53.257]  And so I'm a hundred percent just like Travis was.
[02:39:53.257 --> 02:39:56.018]  And we've got to decide we are William Travis.
[02:39:56.018 --> 02:39:57.359]  We are William Barrett Travis.
[02:39:57.839 --> 02:39:58.540]  All of us.
[02:39:58.540 --> 02:39:59.620]  We're taking action.
[02:39:59.620 --> 02:40:02.002]  And I want to see 10,000 people down there.
[02:40:02.002 --> 02:40:02.302]  Not 1,000.
[02:40:02.302 --> 02:40:04.124]  This Saturday.
[02:40:04.124 --> 02:40:06.846]  You cannot watch the UT football game on us tonight.
[02:40:06.846 --> 02:40:09.668]  Even if you don't come down there with a gun, come down there with a rifle.
[02:40:09.668 --> 02:40:10.668]  Don't come down there with a handgun.
[02:40:10.668 --> 02:40:12.710]  That'll violate the unconstitutional law.
[02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:14.811]  I want to see you there, 10 a.m.
[02:40:14.811 --> 02:40:16.132]  No excuses.
[02:40:16.132 --> 02:40:18.094]  Go ahead, Terry, with final comments.
[02:40:18.094 --> 02:40:18.654]  Final comment.
[02:40:18.654 --> 02:40:19.975]  I want to thank Jared Patterson.
[02:40:19.975 --> 02:40:21.456]  Jared Patterson has put a lot of
[02:40:22.014 --> 02:40:24.235]  Personal capital on the line for this movement.
[02:40:24.235 --> 02:40:28.817]  He is one of the few elected officials that are in this fight with us.
[02:40:28.817 --> 02:40:32.918]  He is telling folks that if you're offended by this, too bad.
[02:40:32.918 --> 02:40:38.341]  I mean, he is coming out as a strong, true patriot, and we would have had a difficult time with this event had he not helped us.
[02:40:38.341 --> 02:40:39.121]  So I want to thank him.
[02:40:39.121 --> 02:40:42.002]  I want to thank you, Alex, for all of your help with the event.
[02:40:42.002 --> 02:40:47.444]  I want to thank all of the open carry groups that are working with us and fighting this fight.
[02:40:47.444 --> 02:40:48.105]  And don't give up.
[02:40:48.105 --> 02:40:48.905]  We're going to keep going.
[02:40:49.648 --> 02:40:52.311]  I want to thank CJ and Scott Liberty and Gary Hayes.
[02:40:52.311 --> 02:40:54.353]  All of these folks are putting it on the line.
[02:40:54.353 --> 02:40:55.514]  And I want to thank everyone.
[02:40:55.514 --> 02:40:57.356]  And yes, we need 10,000 there.
[02:40:57.356 --> 02:41:03.083]  So many of your listeners can come down there and bring their long guns or their black powder revolvers.
[02:41:03.083 --> 02:41:08.989]  Come on and be a part of history because we are making history on Saturday, October the 19th from 10 o'clock till 2 p.m.
[02:41:10.399 --> 02:41:12.821]  I agree with you, and again, we are the media, too.
[02:41:12.821 --> 02:41:15.062]  The First Amendment is just as important as the Second.
[02:41:15.062 --> 02:41:23.927]  Whether you've got a little blog, or you go shoot a video for the first time, put it on YouTube, if there's any mainstream media there that tries to distort things, we'll be there to show what they've really done.
[02:41:23.927 --> 02:41:28.850]  We need the First Amendment to be exercised as well, not just the Second.
[02:41:28.850 --> 02:41:29.571]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:29.571 --> 02:41:30.611]  That is exactly right.
[02:41:30.611 --> 02:41:33.453]  And we need to exercise it right with everything we have.
[02:41:33.453 --> 02:41:34.874]  We don't need to behave like sheep.
[02:41:35.376 --> 02:41:40.283]  We need to stand fearless, we need to stand strong, and we need to stand true, and we do not need to waive on our convictions.
[02:41:40.714 --> 02:41:49.099]  That's right, and about Sunday after this on the Sunday Show, I want to get you guys back on for the aftermath of some of the video that Jakari and David and others are going to be down there shooting.
[02:41:49.099 --> 02:41:50.620]  I'll be there as well.
[02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:53.382]  And I am coming with a rifle strapped to my back, folks.
[02:41:53.382 --> 02:41:55.323]  I'm just going to go down there with the First Amendment.
[02:41:55.323 --> 02:41:58.325]  So this is it, and I want to see everybody down there.
[02:41:58.325 --> 02:42:01.647]  We need to do this more and more, exercise our rights or lose them.
[02:42:01.647 --> 02:42:06.349]  I want to give you the hotline number here, because if they go ahead and convict C.J.
[02:42:06.349 --> 02:42:06.710]  Grisham,
[02:42:07.290 --> 02:42:09.992]  Now, because they may have a rigged jury there in Bell County.
[02:42:09.992 --> 02:42:15.696]  I doubt they will, but if they do and he can't talk to us, I know you're in contact with his family and stuff, Terry.
[02:42:15.696 --> 02:42:19.999]  So we're going to give you the hotline, because they could be coming out with a verdict any time now.
[02:42:19.999 --> 02:42:24.542]  And so as soon as you know about that, if he's unable to call us, please call into the hotline, Terry.
[02:42:24.542 --> 02:42:25.202]  Okay.
[02:42:25.202 --> 02:42:26.983]  All right, there he goes.
[02:42:26.983 --> 02:42:30.146]  Terry with Texans, TXCarry.org.
[02:42:30.146 --> 02:42:30.946]  Thank you so much.
[02:42:30.946 --> 02:42:32.467]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:42:32.467 --> 02:42:36.410]  Folks, this is history that is happening here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:38.459 --> 02:42:39.480]  We just heard from CJ.
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:41.581]  He just called in while I was doing that.
[02:42:41.581 --> 02:42:42.361]  Oh, he's texting us.
[02:42:42.361 --> 02:42:44.923]  He's still in court, doesn't know what's going on yet.
[02:42:44.923 --> 02:42:47.384]  So he's got our hotline, right?
[02:42:47.384 --> 02:42:48.265]  Fantastic.
[02:42:48.265 --> 02:42:49.406]  Good job, guys.
[02:42:49.406 --> 02:42:52.708]  All right, so we'll find out from CJ Grisham what'll happen.
[02:42:52.708 --> 02:42:59.652]  I mean, it's such an upside-down world, folks, where they take your kids.
[02:42:59.652 --> 02:43:04.475]  If your kid breaks their finger on Jungle Gym, even if there's witnesses that it was at a Jungle Gym at the park,
[02:43:06.684 --> 02:43:15.047]  Or if they give your kid vaccines and they have a convulsion, they take your kids.
[02:43:15.047 --> 02:43:18.048]  Or, I mean, no due process.
[02:43:18.048 --> 02:43:22.009]  I see these cases all the time where they'll test a mother's blood.
[02:43:23.780 --> 02:43:30.544]  When she comes in to get a blood test for insurance and don't tell her, if we find even marijuana in your blood, we're going to come take all your kids.
[02:43:30.544 --> 02:43:36.747]  And then they take the kids and give them to convicted drug dealers and child rapists, sometimes at the same time.
[02:43:36.747 --> 02:43:41.589]  You'll have a sex offender, drug dealer over the kids and that's okay.
[02:43:41.589 --> 02:43:43.710]  We just take your kid because you smoke marijuana.
[02:43:43.710 --> 02:43:47.653]  It's just insane.
[02:43:47.653 --> 02:43:51.915]  And I'm just thinking about all the attacks we put up with and it's the same thing with the guns.
[02:43:54.099 --> 02:43:56.180]  You haven't committed any crime.
[02:43:56.180 --> 02:44:00.001]  You're legally carrying a rifle in Texas, in the case of C.J.
[02:44:00.001 --> 02:44:06.003]  Grisham, in the middle of nowhere, to get a merit badge with his son.
[02:44:06.003 --> 02:44:10.425]  And the issue was, is that... Go ahead.
[02:44:10.425 --> 02:44:12.025]  Special report's pretty good.
[02:44:12.025 --> 02:44:12.505]  C.J.
[02:44:12.505 --> 02:44:18.227]  Grisham does go into town with an M4 to exercise.
[02:44:18.227 --> 02:44:20.188]  It does have OpenCarryTexas.org.
[02:44:22.475 --> 02:44:25.256]  In his other time when he's not being a Master Sergeant in the U.S.
[02:44:25.256 --> 02:44:28.237]  Army, 19 years.
[02:44:28.237 --> 02:44:34.560]  And, in between doing all that, he didn't even think this was an open carry deal.
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:37.481]  He just is used to marching with a full pack and a gun.
[02:44:37.481 --> 02:44:40.262]  Had his son marching with a full pack for his merit badge.
[02:44:40.262 --> 02:44:42.683]  I think they said it was a 15-mile hike, was that merit badge?
[02:44:42.683 --> 02:44:44.824]  With a full, I think it was 50-pound pack?
[02:44:44.824 --> 02:44:49.986]  And then, here comes the police in the middle of Texas farmland.
[02:44:49.986 --> 02:44:51.107]  In the middle of nowhere,
[02:44:52.290 --> 02:44:56.756]  And the cops feel so good, they're so satisfied with what they're doing.
[02:44:56.756 --> 02:45:01.782]  I mean, these people really are sad excuses for Texans, much less human beings.
[02:45:01.782 --> 02:45:03.524]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[02:45:03.524 --> 02:45:05.327]  And they're so sure of themselves.
[02:45:05.327 --> 02:45:07.129]  They're the good guy.
[02:45:07.129 --> 02:45:08.611]  We're scaring people.
[02:45:08.611 --> 02:45:10.874]  Somebody drove by and saw you with a gun.
[02:45:12.344 --> 02:45:14.846]  I tell you, nothing against Californians.
[02:45:14.846 --> 02:45:16.187]  We're in a lot of stations in California.
[02:45:16.187 --> 02:45:17.508]  It's a beautiful state.
[02:45:17.508 --> 02:45:19.530]  Have a lot of friends out there.
[02:45:19.530 --> 02:45:21.632]  But there's an exodus out of California.
[02:45:21.632 --> 02:45:25.395]  The mayor of LA admits they're imploding because of everybody leaving LA.
[02:45:25.395 --> 02:45:27.257]  The entertainment industry with the taxes and everything.
[02:45:30.054 --> 02:45:44.838]  But Californians are moving in all over Bell County, they're moving in all over Travis and Hayes County, and everyone I know, almost, that I talk to that has 10 acres to 100 acres, in the middle of nowhere, the Californians always, who did it?
[02:45:44.838 --> 02:45:45.959]  California.
[02:45:45.959 --> 02:45:56.082]  They move in, you're shooting guns in your backyard, or target practicing, the police are called, and the state police, the local police come, and folks, they take your guns.
[02:45:57.389 --> 02:46:00.990]  And they put you in jail saying you scared the neighbor.
[02:46:00.990 --> 02:46:04.570]  They used some rudely displaying or in a manner to cause alarm.
[02:46:04.570 --> 02:46:11.052]  So if the Californian gets scared and you're on... I talked to a guy who has a 240 acre ranch he had.
[02:46:11.052 --> 02:46:12.172]  He was a manager at a restaurant.
[02:46:12.172 --> 02:46:14.432]  He even said I could say his name, but then I lost the car.
[02:46:14.432 --> 02:46:15.633]  I wasn't getting him on.
[02:46:15.633 --> 02:46:19.474]  And the state police came out and they were shooting up their shooting range.
[02:46:19.474 --> 02:46:21.934]  The families had the property for a long time.
[02:46:21.934 --> 02:46:24.935]  The shooting range has been there for like 50 years, you know, just out in the back.
[02:46:24.935 --> 02:46:25.795]  And they took him to jail.
[02:46:25.795 --> 02:46:26.435]  State police did.
[02:46:28.211 --> 02:46:32.212]  In fact, I know a pretty famous gun person.
[02:46:32.212 --> 02:46:33.693]  In fact, I can have him on any time I want.
[02:46:33.693 --> 02:46:38.054]  I haven't even called him to get him on, but I live pretty close to him.
[02:46:38.054 --> 02:46:42.175]  Not too close, but I know folks that do live right behind that know him, and I've talked to him.
[02:46:42.175 --> 02:46:47.037]  He's had the police at his ranch for shooting guns.
[02:46:47.037 --> 02:46:49.277]  I mean, they show up every time he legally shoots guns.
[02:46:49.277 --> 02:46:51.918]  He's got a California neighbor who calls the cops on him.
[02:46:51.918 --> 02:46:53.639]  These people aren't going to stop.
[02:46:53.639 --> 02:46:57.540]  And let me tell you, out in the middle of Texas, out in Bell County,
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:02.082]  Californian drives by and sees your gun, you're going to prison!
[02:47:02.082 --> 02:47:03.722]  It doesn't matter if there's a law.
[02:47:03.722 --> 02:47:06.424]  The cops are going to think something up on you.
[02:47:06.424 --> 02:47:10.265]  I mean, that's how screwed up this country is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:10.265 --> 02:47:13.967]  This country is screwed up.
[02:47:13.967 --> 02:47:21.951]  Where I can't even... Seven miles from a tiny town that doesn't even have a gas station is the nearest town.
[02:47:22.728 --> 02:47:24.751]  That gas station shut down.
[02:47:24.751 --> 02:47:32.144]  I can't walk down the street with a shotgun from one piece of our property over down to another to dove hunt or quail hunt.
[02:47:32.144 --> 02:47:35.229]  If a cop drives by, they'll ask me what I'm doing and call a game warden.
[02:47:37.079 --> 02:47:38.379]  Because you're scum.
[02:47:38.379 --> 02:47:42.860]  They're here to teach you they own you and your family.
[02:47:42.860 --> 02:47:46.821]  And we need to teach them they work for us and they're engaged in criminal activity.
[02:47:46.821 --> 02:47:51.383]  And just because they got a Californian to point at us and say, witch, that's what they do.
[02:47:51.383 --> 02:47:52.243]  That person's a witch.
[02:47:52.243 --> 02:47:54.503]  Well, we'll burn them at the stake because you said so.
[02:47:54.503 --> 02:47:56.024]  They pointed us and they go, gun!
[02:47:56.903 --> 02:48:00.286]  I mean, you can't clean your gun in your garage in the countryside.
[02:48:00.286 --> 02:48:01.466]  You can't load it in your car.
[02:48:01.466 --> 02:48:02.707]  They're coming for you.
[02:48:02.707 --> 02:48:03.228]  They're coming.
[02:48:03.228 --> 02:48:06.210]  They get a call from a Californian, you're going to be under the jail.
[02:48:06.210 --> 02:48:08.972]  Because a Californian is a god.
[02:48:08.972 --> 02:48:10.593]  A California commie.
[02:48:10.593 --> 02:48:12.615]  And that's who they're putting in over Austin politics.
[02:48:12.615 --> 02:48:14.096]  They are the rulers.
[02:48:14.096 --> 02:48:15.497]  They are the god.
[02:48:15.497 --> 02:48:16.418]  They are the king.
[02:48:16.418 --> 02:48:17.659]  They are the masters.
[02:48:17.659 --> 02:48:22.502]  And like a disease, as California implodes, they fan out to wreck everything.
[02:48:22.502 --> 02:48:23.903]  They'll soon leave California.
[02:48:23.903 --> 02:48:25.885]  If they wreck it, we'll have to move to California.
[02:48:26.681 --> 02:48:28.503]  Because the vampires will suck it dry, then leave.
[02:48:28.503 --> 02:48:30.044]  We'll have to run to California next.
[02:48:30.044 --> 02:48:31.485]  It'll be the new Texas in 20 years.
[02:48:31.485 --> 02:48:34.608]  We'll actually collapse all the way into Mexico.
[02:48:34.608 --> 02:48:38.672]  Let's go to this report real quick as we go to break with CJ Grisham.
[02:48:38.672 --> 02:48:38.932]  Here it is.
[02:48:42.659 --> 02:48:45.320]  I can tell you, I can find out that you can legally have a gun.
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:49.043]  So you can just stop anybody in the world from rudely displaying a gun?
[02:48:49.043 --> 02:48:49.603]  Yes.
[02:48:49.603 --> 02:48:51.344]  Oh, how am I rudely displaying a gun?
[02:48:51.344 --> 02:48:52.524]  I'm walking!
[02:48:52.524 --> 02:48:53.685]  My name's Jonathan Garcia.
[02:48:53.685 --> 02:48:58.448]  I'm with Open Carry Texas, and I'm out here today to show my support for Master Sergeant C.J.
[02:48:58.448 --> 02:48:59.108]  Grisham.
[02:48:59.108 --> 02:49:05.772]  The Master Sergeant who was unlawfully arrested and disarmed over in Temple, his trial starts today.
[02:49:05.772 --> 02:49:08.293]  How are you feeling about the proceedings so far?
[02:49:08.293 --> 02:49:10.875]  Well, it's all been procedural right now, just picking a jury.
[02:49:12.398 --> 02:49:15.661]  Again, I don't think I have anything to worry about.
[02:49:15.661 --> 02:49:21.306]  The facts are on my side and the case is going to unfold that way and I'm going to walk out of here
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:26.043]  A free man, and I can begin to hold the people accountable that put me through all this.
[02:49:26.043 --> 02:49:30.226]  I think it was more than half.
[02:49:30.226 --> 02:49:37.672]  I think it was like 80% of the people stood up and said they were familiar with the case.
[02:49:37.672 --> 02:49:38.913]  You know, it's hard to tell.
[02:49:38.913 --> 02:49:41.675]  There are a lot of people who are familiar with the case that
[02:49:42.315 --> 02:49:43.976]  I completely believe that I'm in the wrong.
[02:49:43.976 --> 02:49:49.459]  I call them statists, and then there are those that saw that I wasn't doing anything wrong at all.
[02:49:49.459 --> 02:49:51.060]  I call them constitutionalists.
[02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:54.661]  Saturday, open Kerry March in San Antonio, Line in the Sand.
[02:49:54.661 --> 02:49:55.982]  We're gonna be from 10 to 1 o'clock.
[02:49:55.982 --> 02:49:58.463]  Folks, this full report will be on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:49:58.463 --> 02:49:59.144]  Stay with us.
[02:49:59.144 --> 02:49:59.524]  We'll be back.
[02:50:06.621 --> 02:50:09.723]  News and info that I'm sitting there looking at the clock wrong.
[02:50:09.723 --> 02:50:15.086]  We're going to play the rest of that on the Nightly News coming up tonight.
[02:50:15.086 --> 02:50:21.810]  They were telling me the countdown left on the video and I thought it was countdown up as it meshed with the time up there.
[02:50:21.810 --> 02:50:24.111]  I just got so much on my mind.
[02:50:24.111 --> 02:50:28.294]  Boy, the story up on Infowars.com that we haven't even
[02:50:29.471 --> 02:50:38.753]  Haven't even gotten to yet, is big and is breaking internal TSA documents, body scanners, pat-downs, not for terrorists.
[02:50:38.753 --> 02:50:42.853]  They're to find if you're trying to get out of the country with some silver coins you own.
[02:50:42.853 --> 02:50:46.774]  And they're there to train your child that people in pot-bellied uniforms grab their genitals.
[02:50:46.774 --> 02:50:49.955]  As top psychiatrists and psychologists have said, it's pedophile training.
[02:50:49.955 --> 02:50:51.455]  It's there to break your will.
[02:50:51.455 --> 02:50:53.295]  And the federal documents show that.
[02:50:53.295 --> 02:50:55.796]  Up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:50:55.796 --> 02:50:56.416]  Right now.
[02:50:56.416 --> 02:50:56.976]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:02.839 --> 02:51:07.541]  And now, an important sponsored message for men only from GetEDSolutions.com.
[02:51:07.541 --> 02:51:15.865]  Men who were formerly taking ED medication are now reporting that a secret underground video has restored their male performance better than pills.
[02:51:15.865 --> 02:51:24.328]  These men say this secret underground video is bringing back the male performance and sensation they've been missing for years and it's working better than pills.
[02:51:24.328 --> 02:51:25.909]  Things are so much better now.
[02:51:25.909 --> 02:51:28.350]  Everything kind of came back overnight.
[02:51:28.350 --> 02:51:30.791]  My girlfriend is very happy.
[02:51:30.911 --> 02:51:34.392]  I purchased your product yesterday and it was fantastic.
[02:51:34.392 --> 02:51:38.293]  I have used your system for about three weeks and I'm already seeing great results.
[02:51:38.293 --> 02:51:44.674]  The owner of this video has reported the overwhelming bandwidth costs may necessitate his taking this video down.
[02:51:44.674 --> 02:51:51.096]  Don't miss watching this urgent video on fixing mail performance while it's still up at GetEDSolutions.com.
[02:51:51.096 --> 02:51:55.877]  There may only be hours left, so watch now at GetEDSolutions.com.

[02:52:01.181 --> 02:52:02.822]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[02:52:02.822 --> 02:52:07.265]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[02:52:07.265 --> 02:52:14.490]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[02:52:14.490 --> 02:52:18.753]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[02:52:18.753 --> 02:52:20.855]  Fortunately, there is something you can do about it.
[02:52:20.855 --> 02:52:25.438]  Learn how to be invisible, lock down your privacy, and even disappear forever.
[02:52:25.438 --> 02:52:27.840]  Go to privacylockdown.com to learn how.
[02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:29.060]  That's privacylockdown.com.
[02:52:30.168 --> 02:52:39.474]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:52:39.474 --> 02:52:40.275]  This capitalism?
[02:52:40.275 --> 02:52:46.438]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:52:46.438 --> 02:52:50.141]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:52:50.141 --> 02:52:51.041]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:52:51.041 --> 02:52:52.462]  It's time to understand the system.

[02:52:52.783 --> 02:52:53.063]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:52:59.967 --> 02:53:03.628]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:53:03.628 --> 02:53:07.450]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:53:07.450 --> 02:53:13.632]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:53:13.632 --> 02:53:21.015]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system.
[02:53:21.155 --> 02:53:23.837]  Which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:53:23.837 --> 02:53:28.500]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terragenics.
[02:53:28.500 --> 02:53:38.668]  Pro-EM1 Probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.

[02:53:56.557 --> 02:53:59.198]  T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[02:53:59.198 --> 02:54:08.480]  Lookin' at the headlines up at DrugsReport.com.
[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:09.380]  Confidence restored!
[02:54:09.380 --> 02:54:10.521]  Chinese downgrade U.S.
[02:54:10.521 --> 02:54:11.261]  credit rating.
[02:54:12.816 --> 02:54:14.878]  Debt unlimited now, they're announcing.
[02:54:14.878 --> 02:54:17.439]  It's just, you have to now just always increase the debt.
[02:54:17.439 --> 02:54:24.945]  That is how you don't raise the debt, as Obama said, is that you continue to increase it.
[02:54:24.945 --> 02:54:29.028]  And the Daily Caller reports there's no actual debt ceiling right now.
[02:54:29.028 --> 02:54:32.790]  That's right, just make it unlimited.
[02:54:32.790 --> 02:54:34.772]  And meanwhile, Obama came out today.
[02:54:34.772 --> 02:54:36.733]  This video's up on Infowars.com.
[02:54:36.733 --> 02:54:38.054]  Kurt Nimmo wrote about it.
[02:54:38.054 --> 02:54:40.556]  Obama came out, our good old Obama.
[02:54:42.069 --> 02:54:48.232]  And he said to us that don't trust the blogs, don't trust the alternative media, don't trust talk radio.
[02:54:48.232 --> 02:54:51.453]  He means Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Michael Savage.
[02:54:51.453 --> 02:54:53.734]  That's who they're talking about.
[02:54:53.734 --> 02:54:55.254]  That's who really worries them right there.
[02:54:55.254 --> 02:54:56.495]  I mean, I'm just telling you.
[02:54:56.495 --> 02:54:57.815]  Believe me, I'm not like bragging either.
[02:54:57.815 --> 02:55:00.176]  I don't really like being in this position.
[02:55:00.176 --> 02:55:01.337]  It's like brinksmanship.
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:06.601]  Russian roulette to even keep doing this, but whatever.
[02:55:06.601 --> 02:55:09.042]  I mean, I go to arm marches and everything.
[02:55:09.042 --> 02:55:10.663]  I'm just done being a slave, folks.
[02:55:10.663 --> 02:55:12.284]  I'm not going to live on my knees.
[02:55:12.284 --> 02:55:15.025]  I'm not going to let my forebearers, my ancestors down.
[02:55:15.025 --> 02:55:17.326]  They were all tough as nails, and I'm nothing compared to them.
[02:55:17.326 --> 02:55:19.347]  Least I can do is fight these people.
[02:55:19.347 --> 02:55:24.949]  So let's go ahead and go to Obama saying, don't listen to the alternative media, because we're the real media.
[02:55:24.949 --> 02:55:26.750]  We are the media.
[02:55:26.750 --> 02:55:31.712]  Not his lying MSNBC that we've caught framing veterans in the new edited video.
[02:55:31.712 --> 02:55:32.052]  Here it is.
[02:55:33.305 --> 02:55:41.492]  But all my friends in Congress understand that how business is done in this town has to change.
[02:55:41.492 --> 02:55:43.614]  Oh yeah, make it ten times worse like you do it?
[02:55:43.614 --> 02:55:46.657]  Because we've all got a lot of work to do on behalf of the American people.
[02:55:46.657 --> 02:55:47.377]  Business has to change?
[02:55:47.377 --> 02:55:50.500]  And that includes the hard work of regaining their trust.
[02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:53.423]  As he accelerates raping us financially with foreign banks?
[02:55:53.423 --> 02:55:57.767]  Our system of self-government doesn't function without it.
[02:55:57.767 --> 02:55:59.188]  And now that the government has reopened,
[02:56:00.609 --> 02:56:03.251]  And this threat to our economy is removed.
[02:56:03.251 --> 02:56:16.018]  All of us need to stop focusing on the lobbyists and the bloggers and the talking heads on radio and the professional activists who profit from conflict and focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do.
[02:56:16.018 --> 02:56:17.139]  And that's grow this economy.
[02:56:17.932 --> 02:56:19.113]  Create good jobs.
[02:56:19.113 --> 02:56:19.553]  That's enough.
[02:56:19.553 --> 02:56:20.234]  Strengthen the middle class.
[02:56:20.234 --> 02:56:20.834]  Get him off there.
[02:56:20.834 --> 02:56:28.900]  I mean, folks, the avowed plan is destroy all the economy they don't control, transfer it all over to Fortune 100, shut everything down, make us slaves.
[02:56:28.900 --> 02:56:34.584]  I mean, that's stated goal by Warren, turd, butt, and all the rest of them.
[02:56:34.584 --> 02:56:37.707]  Warren Buffett, I mean, I just cannot handle it anymore.
[02:56:39.363 --> 02:56:41.465]  I just, it's just ridiculous.
[02:56:41.465 --> 02:56:46.709]  Warren Buffett always poses with an ice cream cone on TV because, you know, he owns part of Dairy Queen.
[02:56:46.709 --> 02:56:47.410]  Well, I won't go there.
[02:56:47.410 --> 02:56:48.951]  It's fast food anyways.
[02:56:48.951 --> 02:56:52.053]  The point is, is that he always has an ice cream cone.
[02:56:52.053 --> 02:56:53.535]  Like, look, I'm not threatening.
[02:56:53.535 --> 02:56:57.198]  I'm not a hardcore gangster with money laundering operations.
[02:56:57.198 --> 02:57:01.161]  I don't run drug cartels on record and fund these shipments and aircraft.
[02:57:01.161 --> 02:57:02.622]  I have an ice cream cone.
[02:57:02.622 --> 02:57:05.485]  Drug cartel people all wear sombreros.
[02:57:05.485 --> 02:57:08.127]  You know, it is, it is unbelievable.
[02:57:09.847 --> 02:57:11.188]  How these people operate.
[02:57:11.188 --> 02:57:15.109]  Yeah, type in Warren Buffett and it's every photo's with a stinking ice cream cone.
[02:57:15.109 --> 02:57:16.750]  Look, I'm an old nice man.
[02:57:16.750 --> 02:57:18.671]  Get in my car, little girl.
[02:57:18.671 --> 02:57:22.092]  I mean, it is just, come on.
[02:57:22.092 --> 02:57:24.653]  Talk about a creep.
[02:57:24.653 --> 02:57:25.974]  Who gets my tax money?
[02:57:27.210 --> 02:57:28.131]  Let's just get him off there.
[02:57:28.131 --> 02:57:33.575]  I can't even let... Warren Buffett, I mean, really makes... because he's got that whole fake act, and I happen to know from sources what he's really like.
[02:57:33.575 --> 02:57:42.283]  I mean, the guy is a demon eugenicist with Bill Gates, and just treats his family like absolute trash.
[02:57:42.283 --> 02:57:47.808]  And, again, it's not that he's some hard businessman, tough guy, gets stuff done.
[02:57:47.808 --> 02:57:49.049]  No, no.
[02:57:49.049 --> 02:57:52.232]  He lives off the government and insider deals, and I have to be lectured by him.
[02:57:52.232 --> 02:57:54.914]  Okay, I didn't mean to get off on my pet peeve of Warren Buffett.
[02:57:56.897 --> 02:57:58.419]  Makes me very, very angry.
[02:57:58.419 --> 02:58:00.781]  The big story is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:00.781 --> 02:58:05.546]  Internal TSA documents, body scanners, pat-downs, not for terrorists.
[02:58:05.546 --> 02:58:12.013]  We will have by the nightly news tonight what happened to Mr. Grisham and his trial up in Waco by Temple.
[02:58:13.766 --> 02:58:14.646]  Two towns right beside each other.
[02:58:14.646 --> 02:58:16.587]  It's actually Bell County.
[02:58:16.587 --> 02:58:17.387]  We're going to get C.J.
[02:58:17.387 --> 02:58:19.968]  Grisham at least an update, if not on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:58:19.968 --> 02:58:21.168]  In fact, I think that's who they should probably interview.
[02:58:21.168 --> 02:58:28.330]  I know they have another interview set up, maybe an overdrive interview for the Nightly News, because we need to find out what happened to him, and that court case will be following that.
[02:58:28.330 --> 02:58:30.031]  And Lord will, and I'll be back tomorrow.
[02:58:30.031 --> 02:58:31.111]  Pray for us.
