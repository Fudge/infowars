[00:00:02.591 --> 00:00:04.857]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:05.098 --> 00:00:07.284]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:00:14.352 --> 00:00:18.537]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:19.999]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:21.700]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.905]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:30.571]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.663]  Necessity dictates that I control myself today.
[00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:52.730]  Necessity dictates that I cover all this news and give you a report on what's happening.
[00:00:53.271 --> 00:01:02.479]  But I don't want to just focus in on the specific little nodules of horrifying, metastasizing
[00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:11.457]  Gangs of different control freak groups eating out our substance as the Declaration of Independence bemoaned.
[00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:15.679]  I want to talk about humanity in crisis.
[00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.962]  I saw a study two days ago about television lowering IQs and motor skills in children.
[00:01:22.462 --> 00:01:23.823]  In fact, will you reprint that for me guys?
[00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:26.144]  Yeah, they're turning into zombies.
[00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:30.860]  And this is not just some accident of the industrialized world.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:42.906]  This has been decided to accentuate this slouch towards immorality, so that people are more easily controlled.
[00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:55.632]  And I know that most of you understand that, but it was just hitting me this morning, how you've got people that are hardworking, smart, informed, nowhere in a crisis, who are a minority,
[00:01:56.966 --> 00:02:05.889]  And then you've got a majority that don't trust the system and know it's corrupt but just don't seem to care and think it's funny and have decided to roll over and die.
[00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:17.953]  But just because you've probably got 60% of the population in the West that's decadent and think it's cool to give in to tyranny doesn't mean the rest of us
[00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.870]  Then have to stand down and be run over.
[00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:33.074]  The New World Order does not have a galactic license or a universal license to enslave and persecute goodness.
[00:02:36.816 --> 00:02:45.359]  And so just because a lot of other people are hypnotized by evil and want to bow to it does not mean that I'm going to bow to it.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.521]  But in the process we cannot tear ourselves apart
[00:02:49.994 --> 00:03:01.065]  I mean, I get crazed, ladies and gentlemen, now, because this stuff is just, it's all coming true, just like I said it would, because I was reading their own documents, but there's the realization of, man, they're really going to carry all this out.
[00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:03.988]  And there is a horror to being right.
[00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.471]  And a desperation.
[00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:12.237]  And that's the only reason this broadcast is successful, is because I am desperate.
[00:03:13.154 --> 00:03:25.485]  And that truth telegraphs over to people that I realize in a natural response how crazy this is and I'm able to shake some zombies out of their trance.
[00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:28.087]  But then I realize I'm not upset enough.
[00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:31.009]  Like, should I?
[00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.070]  Screw around and engage in satire and joke around a little bit.
[00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.531]  We all need gallows humor.
[00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:44.695]  I know it soothes my soul to do it, but it's more poignant and focused and powerful when I just tell it like it is, straight and calm to people.
[00:03:45.235 --> 00:04:01.022]  Which I can do better than anybody, but I hardly ever do it because I'm so tortured, and I know you're tortured, by the over-the-top bizarreness of corruption and evil and how it just seeks
[00:04:03.171 --> 00:04:05.734]  To pull down all this beautiful, strong, and good.
[00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:08.317]  You marvel at it.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.769]  Like John on the island of, what was it, Patmos, marveled at the beast.
[00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.374]  And I have stared so long into the abyss that
[00:04:27.622 --> 00:04:53.496]  That it's like both sides are coming together, and even though I oppose the system, I know it, and know it's dark logic, and it's just bizarre to see the public operating like self-propelled stomachs, mindless jellyfish, two-legged bipedal amoebas, having no idea how fantastical reality is.
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.045]  My wife said it in such a crystallized way this weekend.
[00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:05.776]  She looked out the window Friday night and we could see the moon through the window and the trees blowing in the wind and she said, it's like we're on a spaceship.
[00:05:05.796 --> 00:05:07.719]  And I said, we are.
[00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:14.197]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:05:14.337 --> 00:05:17.301]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:22.688]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:24.670]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.272]  We are what we eat.
[00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:28.495]  Our food is devoid of nutrition.
[00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:29.556]  We're good to go.
[00:05:54.269 --> 00:06:00.095]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[00:06:09.885 --> 00:06:13.506]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:19.029]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:26.811]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:36.095]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:06:36.315 --> 00:06:43.323]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:06:43.483 --> 00:06:46.347]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:06:46.367 --> 00:06:53.295]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[00:06:54.511 --> 00:06:56.132]  Another one, another plane just hit!
[00:06:56.172 --> 00:06:56.973]  State of Mind.
[00:06:57.253 --> 00:06:58.654]  Because there's a war on.
[00:06:58.814 --> 00:06:59.574]  For your mind.

[00:07:10.228 --> 00:07:17.533]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:07:17.974 --> 00:07:21.777]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[00:08:15.132 --> 00:08:16.533]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:08:16.553 --> 00:08:23.919]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:27.762]  Mao took the guns.
[00:08:27.782 --> 00:08:30.124]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:31.125]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:49.508]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:54.590]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[00:08:56.691 --> 00:09:03.474]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny.
[00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:12.100]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:09:12.321 --> 00:09:13.521]  Accelerate!
[00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:16.462]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:09:17.303 --> 00:09:18.343]  Pull the switch!
[00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:19.383]  Drop the bomb!
[00:09:19.984 --> 00:09:20.744]  We're live!
[00:09:20.784 --> 00:09:23.305]  We're going in, going in hot worldwide!
[00:09:23.685 --> 00:09:25.166]  Head up against the technocrats.
[00:09:25.206 --> 00:09:26.566]  We're aware of their operation.
[00:09:27.747 --> 00:09:32.249]  We're contacting humans on a planetary scale that want to be free and have a future.
[00:09:33.169 --> 00:09:39.013]  And the disease of liberty, the virus as the globalists call it, is spreading and will not be stopped.
[00:09:39.894 --> 00:09:59.008]  You know, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get into all the off-the-chart incredible news here today, and we have Dr. Marcola joining us about Coca-Cola running print and TV ads, saying there's no health dangers from aspartame that's in Diet Coke and thousands of other products for that matter, and that it's actually going to make you skinny.
[00:09:59.898 --> 00:10:04.600]  They don't care that there are literally scores of scientific studies out this year.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:14.325]  CBS News and others have reported that it destroys basically your pancreas and gives you diabetes and makes you obese.
[00:10:15.485 --> 00:10:18.607]  I mean, just type in aspartame obesity.
[00:10:18.647 --> 00:10:19.867]  I mean, that's been known forever.
[00:10:20.568 --> 00:10:28.031]  The fattest people you see, 400, 500 pounders, almost always have a Diet Coke in their hand or a Diet Dr. Pepper.
[00:10:31.544 --> 00:10:32.124]  It's amazing.
[00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:34.366]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:10:34.386 --> 00:10:38.569]  Did you know my great-great-grandfather named Dr. Pepper in Temple?
[00:10:39.249 --> 00:10:41.531]  He was an advertising executive and owned newspapers.
[00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:43.673]  It was his name, William Gresham.
[00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:46.655]  And it was a little factoid I forgot about.
[00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:48.536]  Side issue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:49.276 --> 00:11:01.105]  I'm going to get into all the news here, but what is important for everyone to know here
[00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:11.481]  Is that... You are seeing a scientific technocracy.
[00:11:12.221 --> 00:11:18.204]  And I know I say this every day, but... I was on Mankow's show this morning, and he's a smart guy, but he was asking me to quantify that.
[00:11:18.684 --> 00:11:27.849]  You have a ruling globalist elite that controls Europe, the United States, England, and most of the world, and then they're imitated by the communist Chinese and the Russians, but they don't do it as well.
[00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.371]  They want to be the new world order when they grow up to be big kids.
[00:11:32.332 --> 00:11:35.493]  But to a certain extent, China has actually merged with the Anglo-American system.
[00:11:35.533 --> 00:11:37.993]  We've had top geopolitical analysts on to talk about that.
[00:11:38.253 --> 00:11:39.934]  The Council on Foreign Relations admits that.
[00:11:40.894 --> 00:11:49.176]  That's what's so frustrating, is these globalists think you're so dumb, they admit about 97% of what they're doing.
[00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:58.938]  And they don't even really couch a lot of it in thinly-veiled reports they put out.
[00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:02.160]  It's not really veiled at all.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.023]  I mean, the PNAC report put out a year before 9-11, Rebuilding America's Defenses, said we need giant terror attacks to kill around 3,000 people.
[00:12:09.043 --> 00:12:10.103]  It actually says that.
[00:12:10.784 --> 00:12:11.844]  They even get it down to the exact number.
[00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:12.805]  I don't know how they did that.
[00:12:13.385 --> 00:12:14.225]  Or just a lucky guess.
[00:12:14.325 --> 00:12:15.846]  I don't know.
[00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:25.551]  We need giant terror attacks, a new Pearl Harbor, whether real or manufactured, to create this global government and basically have the technocracy take over.
[00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:36.377]  And then you realize it's not like the technocracy is just going to, you know, dumb down and disenfranchise the poor third world.
[00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:40.380]  That's bad enough, because you instinctively know, well, if it happens to them, it's going to happen to me.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.063]  That's why you have a moral programming to have empathy.
[00:12:44.643 --> 00:12:49.827]  It's not really because, according to their view, that you're a good, loving person.
[00:12:50.327 --> 00:12:56.532]  It's that in predatory species, you have hardwired programming to not kill
[00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:03.746]  members of your own group to only go out and engage in predatory activity against designated prey animals.
[00:13:04.987 --> 00:13:07.188]  But the globalists have designated 99.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
[00:13:24.602 --> 00:13:25.562]  Okay, that's the real number.
[00:13:25.662 --> 00:13:31.685]  And it used to be the 10% just a few decades ago in the West that had the money.
[00:13:32.005 --> 00:13:34.887]  That's all being dissipated, transferred, destroyed.
[00:13:36.207 --> 00:13:40.009]  And when they've got that taken out, you're just going to be worrying about getting your next meal.
[00:13:40.469 --> 00:13:42.650]  You're going to be worried about getting your welfare check.
[00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.232]  Even if you work all day, you'll get a supplemental check that allows you to live.
[00:13:45.532 --> 00:13:47.032]  It's all been actuaried out.
[00:13:47.192 --> 00:13:48.133]  This is collectivism.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.723]  And then you're never going to worry again about being uppity with the system.
[00:13:53.803 --> 00:13:55.304]  You will do whatever they say.
[00:13:55.824 --> 00:14:00.127]  You will work in the robot factories, on the robots that are building the robots.
[00:14:00.207 --> 00:14:04.550]  You will work as an assistant to the robots in the combat field.
[00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:08.793]  You will work as a secret police officer, disappearing people.
[00:14:08.853 --> 00:14:12.916]  You will do whatever because it's all set up to where that's the only way you can survive.
[00:14:13.755 --> 00:14:28.084]  And they basically, like a funnel, shut free societies into less and less free paradigms in the name of survival and security, and then they only shut that down into smaller and smaller funnels as that expands and accelerates.
[00:14:29.065 --> 00:14:32.227]  And it is the end of humanity.
[00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:35.129]  I mean, they tell the average professor, we're going to get rid of 80% of people for the earth.
[00:14:36.052 --> 00:14:43.538]  Yeah, but you'll be allowed to survive and, you know, take part in the new development of the superhuman class that'll merge with machines.
[00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:57.210]  Then you get up higher level, and they're like, well, actually, we need to get rid of 90% or so, because, you know, just any amount of humans is bad, and then it could also, they could get into other groups later and then oppose our plan, and then that would stop the wonderful world we're building from happening.
[00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.272]  So, to really, it needs to be 90%.
[00:15:00.413 --> 00:15:06.657]  And then you get into higher level globalist areas and they go, actually we just want a few million people and they aren't even going to really be people.
[00:15:06.677 --> 00:15:10.098]  We're going to be living forever and you're still going to want to have some children.
[00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:11.779]  So we've done the math on that.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:17.382]  We'll repopulate up to a hundred million or so and stop at that point if you choose to have children as a member of the elite.
[00:15:17.723 --> 00:15:21.685]  So we need to go ahead and move that down to a couple million first before we build a new civilization.
[00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:26.467]  And this is in all their publications.
[00:15:26.528 --> 00:15:28.989]  I mean, they're going to kill almost everybody.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:42.026]  And they're just getting everybody drunk on dead culture, drunk on being decadent, nihilistic, and not caring, drunk on all the poisons, the brainwaves are lowering, the IQs are plunging, the death rates are exploding.
[00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:43.307]  I mean, all the numbers are there.
[00:15:43.347 --> 00:15:48.590]  Like, if the Western world was a patient, all the life signs are going down.
[00:15:50.242 --> 00:15:59.158]  We're going into a coma, and I'm sitting here along with the rest of humanity that's awake, a little sector of the brain, desperately going, this isn't a dream, folks.
[00:15:59.178 --> 00:15:59.960]  Get out of the dream.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.402]  Get out of the trance.
[00:16:03.031 --> 00:16:06.714]  It's like one of those dreams where you can't wake up and we're here saying, no, no, this is real.
[00:16:07.095 --> 00:16:07.895]  This isn't a dream.
[00:16:07.936 --> 00:16:09.077]  You're in a hospital bed.
[00:16:09.297 --> 00:16:10.658]  You're being bled right now.
[00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:14.202]  And they're getting ready to fully gut us and take our organs, basically.
[00:16:14.502 --> 00:16:15.683]  You got to wake up.
[00:16:16.344 --> 00:16:21.308]  And then there's this thought process in the group collective mind and the culture of, well, there are too many of us.
[00:16:22.051 --> 00:16:23.472]  And we do hurt the earth.
[00:16:23.652 --> 00:16:26.533]  And, you know, I don't like poor people.
[00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:28.394]  And I don't like the minorities.
[00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:30.054]  And they don't like me either.
[00:16:30.134 --> 00:16:32.015]  And the media plays us off against each other.
[00:16:32.035 --> 00:16:35.757]  Or if you're a, quote, minority, well, the government's my friend.
[00:16:35.837 --> 00:16:36.877]  I want the resources.
[00:16:37.177 --> 00:16:38.858]  You know, it's my only avenue for success.
[00:16:38.918 --> 00:16:39.678]  I want it to be bigger.
[00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:45.721]  And so we're all having this internal cultural debate with each other while we're on the bed having our blood drained.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.122]  I mean, it's questionable if we can even reverse what they've done.
[00:16:51.483 --> 00:16:53.505]  God knows what they're putting in these vaccines.
[00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:55.146]  What we know is deadly enough.
[00:16:55.487 --> 00:17:06.117]  Hormones, the reduced fertility, reduced IQ, sterilization, cancer virus, cancer plaques, embedded, triggered at hormonal decrease levels.
[00:17:06.197 --> 00:17:08.099]  I mean, it's just all been actuaried out.
[00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:10.662]  I use the word actuary because it's all battle-planned.
[00:17:11.715 --> 00:17:14.056]  And I'm sitting here going, my God, look at this battle plan!
[00:17:14.436 --> 00:17:17.138]  And you know, they have newspapers make jokes yesterday, I saw one.
[00:17:17.518 --> 00:17:22.861]  Alex Jones thinks they're going to build an off-world space station and then destroy the Earth.
[00:17:23.862 --> 00:17:30.325]  No, I said the elite have built underground bunkers and facilities for when the bioweapons get out or they release them or whatever happens.
[00:17:30.845 --> 00:17:32.806]  The Adam and Eve Center's on record.
[00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.148]  That's what Dr. Strange loves about, 1964.
[00:17:38.336 --> 00:17:39.459]  I mean, that's on record.
[00:17:39.499 --> 00:17:39.759]  The U.S.
[00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:48.419]  has spent more money than all other governments combined on COG, continual government, underground basis, and it's for less than 1% of the population.
[00:17:50.066 --> 00:17:57.027]  I know generals who aren't going to be given access, retired generals, to the facilities and they just know about them and start almost crying when you mention it.
[00:17:58.087 --> 00:18:02.588]  Everybody just wants to go play golf and just have a little bit of fun before all this happens.
[00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:03.968]  Who knows what's going on?
[00:18:04.168 --> 00:18:08.509]  Listen, I'm not going to sit here and play games with these people, okay?
[00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:10.529]  I mean, this is horrific what we're talking about.
[00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:19.011]  And so all the other window dressing, we'll cover it, it's all important news, is only to understand the psych warfare program going on and no one
[00:18:20.276 --> 00:18:23.999]  is more brainwashed than the people working within the system.
[00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.420]  That's why they're the easiest to wake up.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.801]  You go, but I thought they're the most brainwashed.
[00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:32.605]  They're under the most hardcore oppression and manipulation and surveillance and control.
[00:18:32.705 --> 00:18:34.347]  And they know it's a lie.
[00:18:34.587 --> 00:18:35.968]  And they know it's predatory.
[00:18:36.308 --> 00:18:40.331]  And it doesn't make sense to them why this is happening until they hear our broadcast.
[00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:42.413]  And then I tell them where the source documents are.
[00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:45.295]  And I don't tell them what to think.
[00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:46.976]  I just say, hey, open that door.
[00:18:47.156 --> 00:18:47.677]  We're good to go.
[00:19:01.927 --> 00:19:04.208]  Well, you know, humanity is done and so what?
[00:19:04.228 --> 00:19:05.108]  That's just the way it is.
[00:19:05.308 --> 00:19:08.729]  Or the big fake Christians that just say, well, it's the end of the world tomorrow.
[00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.070]  So why should we do anything?
[00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:16.332]  Well, even if it was the Antichrist and all this stuff getting ready to happen, you're not going to warn people.
[00:19:16.552 --> 00:19:21.593]  You're going to go into a building that's a government 501c3 or 50c8 or whatever.
[00:19:22.274 --> 00:19:23.354]  The church is the people.
[00:19:23.414 --> 00:19:24.294]  It's not that building.
[00:19:24.554 --> 00:19:29.236]  You're going to go in there and hear some government toady tell you, do what the government says every sermon.
[00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:35.258]  And by the way, most of these preachers aren't even actively evil.
[00:19:35.298 --> 00:19:40.723]  They are scared now, and have been told, do this, and are having weekly meetings, you know, with the FBI now.
[00:19:41.904 --> 00:19:43.044]  We're all infiltrated.
[00:19:43.064 --> 00:19:45.807]  It is a scientific takedown, okay?
[00:19:46.892 --> 00:19:50.735]  And I just want to tell the FBI and all of you out there, you're dead, your kids are dead, everybody's dead.
[00:19:50.976 --> 00:19:51.856]  And you already know that.
[00:19:51.876 --> 00:19:53.198]  A lot of you probably already got dying kids.
[00:19:53.718 --> 00:19:54.359]  You're going to have more.
[00:19:54.399 --> 00:19:55.279]  Your wife's going to die.
[00:19:55.459 --> 00:19:56.280]  You're going to die young.
[00:19:56.941 --> 00:20:03.486]  And you can stop being a coward and admit I'm right, and decide what we're all going to do about this, or you can keep playing patty cake with the devil.
[00:20:04.327 --> 00:20:08.471]  We'll be right back with the massively important Intel Across the Board.
[00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:08.991]  Stay with us.
[00:20:09.672 --> 00:20:12.034]  Can you go without a good meal for three days?
[00:20:12.334 --> 00:20:14.596]  Is your pantry prepared for what's around the corner?

[00:20:40.526 --> 00:20:44.848]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:45.008 --> 00:20:50.629]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:50.729 --> 00:20:54.070]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:21:16.831 --> 00:21:20.133]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:21:20.413 --> 00:21:26.495]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:21:26.795 --> 00:21:28.656]  We are hurting down here and we need help.

[00:23:08.356 --> 00:23:08.756]  Hi there.
[00:23:09.357 --> 00:23:10.417]  My name is Frank Bates.
[00:23:10.898 --> 00:23:14.100]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:23.506]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[00:23:23.866 --> 00:23:29.890]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[00:23:30.591 --> 00:23:32.152]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[00:23:32.752 --> 00:23:37.836]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[00:23:38.556 --> 00:23:45.639]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[00:23:46.499 --> 00:23:51.401]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:57.963]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[00:23:58.583 --> 00:24:03.905]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[00:24:04.285 --> 00:24:05.445]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[00:24:12.904 --> 00:24:13.345]  Don't worry.
[00:24:13.865 --> 00:24:15.407]  This show is documented.
[00:24:15.908 --> 00:24:18.711]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:22.595]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:24:22.996 --> 00:24:27.100]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:24:27.661 --> 00:24:29.563]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:24:30.704 --> 00:24:45.773]  Let me finish my technocracy breakdown briefly and then when we come back I'll get into the whole divide-and-conquer Oprah Winfrey saying it's racist somebody wouldn't show her a 30-something thousand dollar purse the rodeo clown sensitivity training
[00:24:46.993 --> 00:24:49.796]  Homeland Security investigations of it now.
[00:24:50.456 --> 00:24:51.437]  I told you that was coming.
[00:24:51.457 --> 00:24:54.479]  This is the criminalization of free speech that's going on.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:02.706]  How it ties into what's happening with 19 shocking examples about political correctness is destroying America versus the real liberties we're losing.
[00:25:03.386 --> 00:25:14.616]  And when everybody hypersensitive imagining slights or obsessing over slights, selectively with the federal government, that's really the global government, acting as the arbiter.
[00:25:16.315 --> 00:25:19.017]  Speaking of the technocracy, you guys can search into this.
[00:25:19.037 --> 00:25:20.157]  I'm going to tell you during the break.
[00:25:20.217 --> 00:25:24.580]  Type in TheMarshallPlanWired.com.
[00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:36.327]  And it's like a 10, 11-year-old article, but it showed the then 90-year-old futurist who'd been there since the 40s, the head Pentagon futurist.
[00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:40.360]  And there it is, the Marshall Plan.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:54.211]  For 40 years, the man the Pentagon Insiders calls Yoda has foreseen the future of war, from battlefield bots rolling off radar-proof ships to GIs popping performance pills, and that was before the War on Terror.
[00:25:54.871 --> 00:26:06.841]  Now, this guy is tied into another group of people, and you might want to go read his writings from the 1950s, because it's everything that Starship Troopers and all that's based on.
[00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:13.931]  When you see Skynet and you see the robots and all that, that's one of his plans from the 70s.
[00:26:14.951 --> 00:26:19.312]  And most of what he talked about has now been set up.
[00:26:20.933 --> 00:26:22.533]  And then they plan to set the rest of it up.
[00:26:22.593 --> 00:26:24.753]  So let me tell you what they're doing.
[00:26:25.534 --> 00:26:31.775]  Now I knew this, but I'm on a ski boat last night with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[00:26:33.339 --> 00:26:35.741]  Yeah, every once in a while I get some R&R, so I went out with my friends.
[00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:36.661]  They took me out on the boat.
[00:26:39.163 --> 00:26:44.467]  Went out with Shane Steiner and his brothers, Sid and Bobby, their dad, who had a great time rope-swinging, surfing.
[00:26:44.487 --> 00:26:47.529]  You know, I'm not good at it, but they were doing it all great.
[00:26:47.569 --> 00:26:53.473]  Biggs jumped right on and was surfing, you know, without the rope behind the boat in the wake of it.
[00:26:54.234 --> 00:26:55.735]  He was a surfer before he joined the Army.
[00:26:57.489 --> 00:27:07.961]  And while we're watching Rocker, nine-year-old, do backflips and everything over and over again, wakeboarding, I look over to Biggs, and I said, hey, did they drug you guys?
[00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:10.123]  Because I already know everything they're basically doing.
[00:27:10.383 --> 00:27:13.066]  A lot of them have already had microchips, a lot of them already had brain chips.
[00:27:13.507 --> 00:27:14.708]  That's highly classified.
[00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:27.240]  I had some family tell me about it about six years ago and then afterwards called and said do not ever talk about that again and I'm in a lot of trouble over even you and I didn't say who told me but he said it didn't matter they figured it out.
[00:27:29.081 --> 00:27:39.231]  They got brain chips I mean probably 30 years they've been testing them on trips but I mean now a lot of the special forces people have brain chips they have chips in their eyes it's it's it's it's incredible ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:40.083 --> 00:27:42.646]  And you can go read Marshall talking about it 30, 40 years ago.
[00:27:43.167 --> 00:27:47.272]  But Marshall said we've got to turn them into biological androids.
[00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:49.204]  The truth is
[00:28:19.024 --> 00:28:25.207]  A pilot on a plane, this has already happened to a certain extent, the pilot unions have said this, will be like a ceremonial toilet attendant.
[00:28:27.228 --> 00:28:31.771]  They'll just be there almost as like a PR person with a hat that comes and talks to people and sits there.
[00:28:31.791 --> 00:28:36.913]  And already that's why they're having more crashes, the pilots have said, because everything's remote control already.
[00:28:37.054 --> 00:28:39.115]  Autopilot taking off, autopilot landing.
[00:28:39.335 --> 00:28:41.096]  They don't know what to do when there's a problem.
[00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:43.617]  Or when the computer didn't foresee something.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:29:00.233]  So the point is, I'm sitting there, and Biggs goes, yeah, they'd have the Russian helicopters, and I went and looked it up last night, and there it all was, deliver us the drugs, and we were ordered to take them, and there was a lot of it, we didn't know what it was, but it was like, a lot of it was Percocet.
[00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:04.256]  And they were priming them all to become opium addicts when they got out.
[00:29:05.618 --> 00:29:12.724]  And then they would take them off the Percocet, and then everybody would want the opiate, and they'd go, well, we're gonna test for Percocet, but there is opium.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.601]  Because he didn't understand it.
[00:29:15.641 --> 00:29:16.881]  I was explaining it all to him.
[00:29:17.462 --> 00:29:23.224]  And he said the helicopters would land and they basically told him, we don't want you to have any pain or feel bad what you're doing.
[00:29:23.244 --> 00:29:26.366]  They were going into whole villages and, you know, wiping people out and stuff.
[00:29:27.106 --> 00:29:31.288]  And so they were putting him on huge dosages of painkillers without even being hurt.
[00:29:31.949 --> 00:29:34.610]  Just to addict them to then have leverage over them.
[00:29:35.611 --> 00:29:36.291]  Now that's nothing.
[00:29:36.311 --> 00:29:38.412]  They give the special forces amnesiacs after.
[00:29:38.432 --> 00:29:43.755]  You know, he was just a regular army and airborne.
[00:29:44.636 --> 00:29:55.045]  But the point is, is that... And again, I already knew more than he knew, but I was hearing it from his perspective, how they would send in these CIA doctors and just drug all the troops.
[00:29:56.126 --> 00:29:57.887]  I mean, that's the new world order, folks.
[00:29:58.768 --> 00:29:59.649]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.169 --> 00:30:01.771]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.691 --> 00:30:05.394]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:19.615 --> 00:31:26.038]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:28.379]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.

[00:32:10.242 --> 00:32:12.325]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:32:12.345 --> 00:32:19.954]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:32:20.375 --> 00:32:25.041]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:32:25.321 --> 00:32:27.244]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:32:27.484 --> 00:32:29.026]  If every one of us who can,
[00:32:29.346 --> 00:32:30.587]  We'll take care of ourselves.
[00:32:30.867 --> 00:32:33.590]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:41.697]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[00:32:42.097 --> 00:32:48.423]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[00:32:48.483 --> 00:32:49.484]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:39.722]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:43.304 --> 00:33:46.265]  You won't see him play patty cake with the devil.
[00:33:50.707 --> 00:33:52.928]  Oh, you gotta love the Chuck Berry song.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:02.283]  Performed by Ron Halford.
[00:34:05.185 --> 00:34:20.896]  We are live, broadcasting worldwide, cheerfully, throwing ourselves into info war combat, up against the enemy, daring them to smash us, flatter than a pancake, to awaken the rest of the slaves out of their sleep.
[00:34:21.576 --> 00:34:36.953]  Because if our destruction will awaken like a great drum, a great warning drum, a great bell being struck in the heavens as we come in like a shooting star falling to earth, then it is worth it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:38.663 --> 00:34:43.185]  We're here, ladies and gentlemen, Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:34:43.205 --> 00:34:43.826]  to 2 p.m.
[00:34:43.886 --> 00:34:57.633]  Central Standard Time, and we return weeknight, 7 o'clock, with InfoWars Nightly News, which is subscription-powered and driven, and Operation Sleeping Giant, 11 memberships for $5.95 a month.
[00:34:59.281 --> 00:35:04.226]  One membership you can share your username and passcode with 11 people who can log on simultaneously.
[00:35:04.546 --> 00:35:13.814]  And unfortunately, most people don't use the membership all the time when you give it to them to see all the films and other films and books and high def and the nightly news live and everything else.
[00:35:15.016 --> 00:35:18.739]  And archives, commercial free, audio, video of the daytime show.
[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:22.863]  And an alternative to the censors on YouTube and the rest of it.
[00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:28.971]  Unfortunately, a lot of people don't end up using it all the time, so you could probably share it with 20, 30, 40 people.
[00:35:28.991 --> 00:35:31.833]  And then if you get locked out sometimes, hey, that's the good news.
[00:35:31.873 --> 00:35:36.537]  It means people are using the membership you shared with them, so go get another 595 membership.
[00:35:36.878 --> 00:35:42.262]  You better vote with your dollars now to support people that are scientifically aware.
[00:35:43.243 --> 00:35:47.526]  Of what's going on, but are physically and spiritually motivated to resist tyranny.
[00:35:48.126 --> 00:35:57.112]  That's what we need, is the right combination of people that have general knowledge of the world, who realize that they want a future for humanity, and that that's what's going to fulfill you.
[00:35:57.492 --> 00:36:10.300]  If people knew the way I felt, if people knew what it's like to be aware and informed and understand the world, and to be helping humanity, it is the most empowering, fulfilling thing you can possibly imagine.
[00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:16.303]  Having all the best, you know, looking girlfriends.
[00:36:16.323 --> 00:36:23.127]  I mean, I had probably seven different dates a week if I wanted them, you know, back when I was 19, 20, 21 years old.
[00:36:24.428 --> 00:36:29.191]  Having, you know, one of the cool parties, you name it, none of it was fulfilling.
[00:36:30.506 --> 00:36:31.848]  Because it isn't fulfilling.
[00:36:31.928 --> 00:36:35.052]  Fulfilling is a wife you love and children you love and you stand with.
[00:36:35.272 --> 00:36:37.596]  Fulfilling is building good things that help other people.
[00:36:37.836 --> 00:36:39.138]  Fulfillment is working hard.
[00:36:39.438 --> 00:36:42.702]  Fulfillment is being honorable and people knowing you're honorable.
[00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:54.595]  That's why they always attack my honor, and always say I'm a backstabber, I'm a liar, I'm corrupt, I'm this and that, because the system knows I'm for real, and they're afraid other people might emulate what we've done.
[00:36:54.855 --> 00:36:55.736]  Not that we're perfect.
[00:36:56.196 --> 00:36:58.117]  My work is dirty rags before the Creator.
[00:36:58.397 --> 00:37:06.781]  My point is, is that the idea of being honorable, if it ever catches on again, folks, that's it for the new world order.
[00:37:09.782 --> 00:37:11.343]  We are entering the age of dishonor.
[00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:21.604]  Of betrayal, of backstabbing, of arrogant narcissism, of degeneracy, of sadists who enjoy persecuting the innocent.
[00:37:23.345 --> 00:37:32.008]  We are entering an artificial system of less and less resources, when we have unlimited resources with the technological systems that have been suppressed.
[00:37:32.868 --> 00:37:34.029]  Nearly unlimited.
[00:37:36.172 --> 00:37:42.740]  There is a globalist technocratic group who has decided to create a false reality through the culture of death they push.
[00:37:44.264 --> 00:38:07.279]  To become an artificial habitat for our minds to have us stand down and not be part of the real world they are constructing and building by siphoning off our energies towards a technocratic robot automated system where we will no longer be needed and now the elites in the castle will not have their ancestral enemy of the peasants without who they disdain so much.
[00:38:09.597 --> 00:38:10.998]  Labor will not just be cheap.
[00:38:11.258 --> 00:38:13.820]  Human life will no longer just not be incredibly cheap.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.082]  It will be a toxic waste to be removed.
[00:38:17.442 --> 00:38:20.765]  And they're already romanticizing the end of the civilization.
[00:38:21.789 --> 00:38:25.410]  The crossover civilization and the birth of the new civilization.
[00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.250]  And I've studied history.
[00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:28.251]  I've studied these people.
[00:38:28.611 --> 00:38:31.651]  They will not stop killing each other until they've killed every single one of themselves.
[00:38:32.372 --> 00:38:33.412]  They are not going to stop.
[00:38:33.432 --> 00:38:34.032]  It is their nature.
[00:38:34.532 --> 00:38:35.892]  The journey is the destination.
[00:38:36.153 --> 00:38:41.774]  The destination that even their high-level Luciferian adepts have been given is not where you're going.
[00:38:42.014 --> 00:38:43.614]  And I know many of you say, I don't care.
[00:38:43.634 --> 00:38:44.795]  I am joined with it.
[00:38:45.015 --> 00:38:46.795]  And I love the power I get out of it.
[00:38:47.055 --> 00:38:49.896]  You don't get any power out of what you're doing.
[00:38:50.316 --> 00:39:18.238]  You are a reflection of darkness, a reflection of destruction, only by turning yourself over to life and to creation and the creator of the creation, only by submitting yourself to that, only by asking God into your heart, the real God, not the one in these devil churches, the devil's greatest work, but the real God of the universe that you have a personal relationship and you don't need some high priest in front of you to bring you through that door.
[00:39:20.199 --> 00:39:26.661]  When you have that real relationship, ladies and gentlemen, the chains are broken, and the universe will begin to open up to you if you can handle it.
[00:39:26.881 --> 00:39:32.362]  And there's a reason people drug themselves and get into evil, because evil is a lot easier than being good.
[00:39:32.622 --> 00:39:37.844]  Because being good is far beyond what you've ever been told by the New World Order that it is.
[00:39:38.264 --> 00:39:43.005]  It is not some shrieking, violent, coward person who's stupid and naive.
[00:39:43.085 --> 00:39:45.886]  It is people on fire with liberty and power!
[00:39:47.608 --> 00:39:52.289]  With God shining through us as, in his own image, sub-creators.
[00:39:53.969 --> 00:39:58.610]  Now, most people turn to evil because you can't handle being really good.
[00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:01.451]  Because let me tell you a little secret, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:01.731 --> 00:40:03.631]  God has knowledge of all this evil.
[00:40:03.871 --> 00:40:11.573]  God allowed it to take place to have us in the gladiatorial arena show who we really are for eternity.
[00:40:12.413 --> 00:40:16.634]  Because a child not made to work and be honorable will become a spoiled brat.
[00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:19.411]  We'll become a demon!
[00:40:21.072 --> 00:40:26.016]  And that's why we're here, spiritually, no doubt about it, to be tested in this crucible.
[00:40:28.719 --> 00:40:32.742]  So that the creator of the universe can decide if we go on to the next level.
[00:40:33.263 --> 00:40:43.511]  And you know it's there, and the devil worshippers, and the Luciferians know it's there, and that's why they want to try to imitate God, and that's why they want to try to act like God, and Google says their goal is to be the mind of God.
[00:40:44.591 --> 00:40:53.557]  And to be able to make themselves gods and to know everything about everyone so they can cut us off and destroy us physically.
[00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:58.340]  This is a bunch of miscreants trying to play creator.
[00:41:00.582 --> 00:41:02.903]  Setting themselves up just as the devil did.
[00:41:02.923 --> 00:41:07.467]  I mean, there's the whole evidence of God and the devil right there.
[00:41:07.727 --> 00:41:10.709]  Look at how they manifest all the attributes of Satan.
[00:41:12.145 --> 00:41:17.407]  Beelzebub, Shaitan, Leviathan, whatever name you want to give it, all right there!
[00:41:24.551 --> 00:41:39.038]  Even if you don't believe in unseen forces in this universe, as you look out your window at night and see the moon rising above the trees and distant nebulas and stars on a orbiting rock with a molten center around a huge star,
[00:41:40.058 --> 00:41:55.843]  Out on the edge of a galaxy, staring into eternity, and you'll let some programmed trendy tell you that because you have deep connection to the universe, and that you feel the great eternity around you, that there is no...
[00:41:57.083 --> 00:42:00.286]  God, that there is nothing unseen, that they know everything?
[00:42:00.546 --> 00:42:02.147]  They want to be your priest!
[00:42:02.508 --> 00:42:04.129]  They want to be your God!
[00:42:04.449 --> 00:42:05.970]  They want to be your ruler!
[00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:07.932]  They want to be your controller!
[00:42:08.232 --> 00:42:10.114]  They want to take your free will!
[00:42:12.235 --> 00:42:18.781]  They are the most blasphemous, disgusting, filthy, stinking, ugly,
[00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:27.262]  Just microscopic little devils in comparison to the creator of the universe and you worship them!
[00:42:27.802 --> 00:42:29.223]  You bow to them!
[00:42:30.805 --> 00:42:43.576]  As they attack everything good, the family, as they attack the woman, as they attack the children, as they attack the father, as they pull down everything that's good, because it is ugly in their eyes, because it's not their creation!
[00:42:44.775 --> 00:42:48.316]  And then all of their creations are ugly and twisted and aren't even creations.
[00:42:48.556 --> 00:42:52.457]  They are nothing but abominations of what was already set in motion!
[00:42:53.417 --> 00:42:58.398]  The fruits of the New World Order are hell and death and destruction!
[00:43:01.159 --> 00:43:08.301]  The fruits of the New World Order is mass genocide, not just against individuals, but against cultures and ideas and everything that's good.
[00:43:08.321 --> 00:43:11.822]  I did not mean to get up here today and start preaching, it's just...
[00:43:13.399 --> 00:43:16.601]  It is unbelievable the potential humanity has.
[00:43:17.501 --> 00:43:19.663]  And I know that this is the great test we enter.
[00:43:21.484 --> 00:43:23.785]  But it is painful to see so many fallen.
[00:43:25.086 --> 00:43:27.607]  It is painful to see so many who are spiritually blind.
[00:43:28.388 --> 00:43:33.571]  It is painful to see so many who have no idea whose hand they have placed their trust.
[00:43:38.888 --> 00:43:45.233]  The authoritarianism coming in, the persecution of everything good, all so these control freaks can play God.
[00:43:45.553 --> 00:43:54.100]  The whole world given over to the most craven, vicious, spiritually stinking, wicked, damned demons.
[00:43:55.261 --> 00:43:57.523]  And by damned, I don't mean that in the Lord's name in vain.
[00:43:57.563 --> 00:43:59.344]  They are damned, and they know it.
[00:43:59.565 --> 00:44:04.689]  They are damned off from good, not because God even put them there, but because that's who they are.
[00:44:10.816 --> 00:44:12.697]  I've got to get to news because I've got guests coming up.
[00:44:15.399 --> 00:44:16.740]  Document Cam plays for TV viewers.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.261]  I want to go over some of these articles for people.
[00:44:20.722 --> 00:44:24.965]  Let's just finish up with the point that
[00:44:26.365 --> 00:44:28.446]  The media talks about how much they love the troops all day.
[00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:34.330]  They are giving them drugs, trying to get them addicted so that they can take their rights away later, on record.
[00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:35.170]  It's even in the news.
[00:44:36.351 --> 00:44:38.592]  Our government is not our government.
[00:44:38.632 --> 00:44:42.614]  It grows most drugs worldwide and then pushes the synthetic drugs on the kids.
[00:44:42.654 --> 00:44:44.736]  I mean, they're the drug dealers, they're the murderers, they're the killers.
[00:44:45.116 --> 00:44:55.102]  And the very people that are all macho and want to be men, they take men that want to be men, that the new world order hates so much, and they use that male energy and that courage against you
[00:44:55.962 --> 00:45:06.469]  To help carry out wickedness worldwide, which then stirs up the wickedness in the Muslims as well, so that they can have men kill each other in a bloody satanic communion.
[00:45:10.632 --> 00:45:17.456]  They defile all of us with the baby stem cell additives
[00:45:18.496 --> 00:45:20.437]  that are in hundreds of products.
[00:45:20.637 --> 00:45:29.503]  It's just the press being persecuted, the IRS going after people that stand for basic liberty, the open evil going on everywhere.
[00:45:29.783 --> 00:45:31.844]  But they don't want us to be able to focus in on that.
[00:45:31.884 --> 00:45:32.084]  No, no.
[00:45:32.264 --> 00:45:33.305]  It has to all be about race.
[00:45:33.325 --> 00:45:36.967]  It has to all be about where you're from and, oh, don't trust that person.
[00:45:37.207 --> 00:45:38.108]  Don't trust this person.
[00:45:38.148 --> 00:45:41.330]  Just trust the big globalist, technocratic motherships.
[00:45:42.799 --> 00:46:01.066]  Of Paris, and Moscow, and Beijing, and London, and New York, and Tel Aviv, and Tokyo, and all the other big technocratic systems, all designed, all bred, all fed on the blood of the innocents.
[00:46:01.886 --> 00:46:02.787]  Their own innocence.
[00:46:03.387 --> 00:46:08.731]  All these systems destroy their own people as well as whoever they're attacking because we're not their people.
[00:46:09.051 --> 00:46:10.652]  America didn't invade the world.
[00:46:10.952 --> 00:46:15.475]  America was invaded and taken over as an engine against humanity.
[00:46:18.277 --> 00:46:20.438]  Let me go over some of these articles so you know what we're facing.
[00:46:20.979 --> 00:46:22.660]  Pro-NSA editorial.
[00:46:25.009 --> 00:46:26.930]  Flails and snarks at internet users.
[00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:31.612]  Claims those challenging NSA hate Obama.
[00:46:32.972 --> 00:46:35.033]  That's from TechNerd up on Infowars.com.
[00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:40.775]  Sebelius says if you oppose Obamacare, the head of Health and Human Services, you are somehow a racist.
[00:46:40.815 --> 00:46:42.216]  You can go read that article.
[00:46:42.416 --> 00:46:44.857]  See, now it's racist to oppose collectivism.
[00:46:47.618 --> 00:46:52.219]  Daily Mail, Swiss store owner at center of Oprah's racist handbag storm, demands to speak to the Star-Empress.
[00:46:52.239 --> 00:46:53.360]  She says, sorry for the fuss.
[00:46:55.293 --> 00:46:57.656]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, all about, oh, a handbag.
[00:46:58.056 --> 00:47:03.622]  Oh, a $35,000 handbag, Oprah.
[00:47:03.802 --> 00:47:08.287]  She thinks she should be higher taxed than the middle class, but she's basically exempt from taxes and worth billions of dollars.
[00:47:09.148 --> 00:47:13.553]  Family rated by SWAT team for weeds in Arlington, Texas.
[00:47:13.593 --> 00:47:14.054]  That's right.
[00:47:15.802 --> 00:47:19.303]  Documents show Secret Service kept tabs on Aaron Schwartz.
[00:47:19.364 --> 00:47:20.384]  Well, yeah, they killed him.
[00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:22.745]  He said, I'm gonna beat this, you know, these fake charges.
[00:47:22.805 --> 00:47:25.466]  He was the leader of Anonymous, the real Anonymous.
[00:47:25.846 --> 00:47:26.286]  They killed him.
[00:47:27.247 --> 00:47:30.248]  And now it's coming out they were all surveilling him, the FBI and Secret Service, of course.
[00:47:30.968 --> 00:47:32.109]  They went to his house and they hung him.
[00:47:33.479 --> 00:47:34.640]  Just like they'll kill other people.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.501]  Just like they'll kill Michael Hastings.
[00:47:36.721 --> 00:47:38.082]  Because, see, they're in charge.
[00:47:38.122 --> 00:47:39.783]  They're black ops.
[00:47:41.624 --> 00:47:43.385]  They've got a lot of power.
[00:47:43.845 --> 00:47:49.169]  They can go around killing heroes who stand up for humanity and have justice beating in their breasts.
[00:47:49.209 --> 00:47:51.870]  That's very honorable and very lucky.
[00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:53.952]  What's lucky?
[00:47:54.512 --> 00:47:57.174]  It means you've run out of luck.
[00:47:57.994 --> 00:47:59.295]  God doesn't like you now.
[00:47:59.595 --> 00:48:00.156]  You're going to be
[00:48:01.052 --> 00:48:02.735]  You're going to be judged on this life.
[00:48:03.196 --> 00:48:04.258]  You're not going to have to wait.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.342]  That's the good part about this stuff.
[00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:07.384]  You get judged.
[00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.813]  Your kids are going to die in car wrecks and stuff.
[00:48:11.833 --> 00:48:13.216]  You're going to wonder why you have such bad luck.
[00:48:14.943 --> 00:48:16.665]  God's gonna cut you and your whole family down.
[00:48:17.246 --> 00:48:18.127]  Let's continue here.
[00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:20.070]  Here's one on Noam Chomsky.
[00:48:20.591 --> 00:48:25.818]  After multiple denials, CIA admits to snooping on Noam Chomsky.
[00:48:25.918 --> 00:48:26.719]  Oh my goodness!
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.964]  The CIA's spying on professors in America?
[00:48:30.464 --> 00:48:31.385]  Who would've thunk it?
[00:48:32.534 --> 00:48:33.655]  That's out of foreign policy.
[00:48:33.675 --> 00:48:35.676]  A little propaganda arm of the Washington Post.
[00:48:36.157 --> 00:48:39.600]  MIT says smartphones will listen to everything at all times.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:45.304]  And there's a link to the report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology saying, for your safety, they'll be on at all times.
[00:48:45.804 --> 00:48:50.788]  Even when there's no power, they'll have special capacitors listening to everything you're doing and feeding it into a hive mind.
[00:48:50.808 --> 00:48:54.191]  See, now the coming out is that, by the way, they're already doing that.
[00:48:55.052 --> 00:48:57.153]  Whenever they want to activate them, they're doing it, even when they're off.
[00:48:57.193 --> 00:48:59.195]  That's in the 96 Telecommunications Act.
[00:48:59.455 --> 00:49:01.437]  But see, now MIT is going to tell you
[00:49:04.572 --> 00:49:05.453]  Let's continue here.
[00:49:05.793 --> 00:49:11.396]  Is government just spying like a peeping Tom or is it actively using that information in mischievous ways?
[00:49:11.436 --> 00:49:20.540]  Well, the overall spirit is a peeping Tom creeping around and wanting to want to invade your privacy and wanting to case you like a predator because they are predators.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.342]  But of course they're using all the data.
[00:49:24.382 --> 00:49:28.484]  Washington blog then goes through how they're using it to know your profile.
[00:49:29.451 --> 00:49:35.562]  That you'll end up paying on credit cards when they change the rates, or break the contract, or jack up your AT&T bill.
[00:49:35.802 --> 00:49:37.024]  And they have marks.
[00:49:37.044 --> 00:49:37.886]  This has come out in the news.
[00:49:38.146 --> 00:49:42.013]  People that are known to, well we just raised their bill, even though the contract doesn't say it, and they'll pay it.
[00:49:42.901 --> 00:49:45.504]  And you're known as a schmuck, a sucker, a mark.
[00:49:46.285 --> 00:49:46.605]  Okay?
[00:49:47.326 --> 00:49:53.873]  And then of course they know with face scanning cameras, hooked into the government, that's the deal they share with all the major retailers, Target, you name it.
[00:49:54.313 --> 00:49:56.616]  The face scanning is shared with them and they're given the database.
[00:49:56.916 --> 00:49:58.157]  Here's this person's profile.
[00:49:58.818 --> 00:50:03.363]  And they can profile their entire mass on how to rip people off and make them think they're getting a good deal.
[00:50:03.763 --> 00:50:04.844]  And Walmart, all of them do it.
[00:50:05.144 --> 00:50:13.631]  And in Disney World, they admit that is a psychological Pentagon warfare operation practicing the controlling people in and out of FEMA camps.
[00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:15.392]  But you don't know.
[00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:17.013]  It's like, oh, I'm in a theme park.
[00:50:17.213 --> 00:50:19.075]  The whole time, AI computers are watching you.
[00:50:19.235 --> 00:50:20.876]  This is on record, by the way, for 10 years.
[00:50:21.216 --> 00:50:25.019]  Tracking everything you do, everything that goes on, the cruise ships, all of it.
[00:50:25.299 --> 00:50:29.743]  It's all about the digital skin growing to totally enslave humanity.
[00:50:30.782 --> 00:50:32.787]  And the architecture is designed to enslave you.
[00:50:33.329 --> 00:50:37.259]  Google Gmail users have no legitimate expectation of privacy.
[00:50:38.783 --> 00:50:39.943]  That's an announcement by Google.
[00:50:39.963 --> 00:50:41.984]  They say, of course we share all your data and give it to the government.
[00:50:42.924 --> 00:50:49.747]  Hackers taunt child over baby monitor, hacking into the home's internet cameras, and then saying perverted things to the child.
[00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:52.647]  That's big news out of KPTV.
[00:50:52.707 --> 00:50:56.069]  But, I mean, what do you think the government does with all these surveillance systems?
[00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:57.489]  Oh, I can look at my house while I'm gone.
[00:50:57.509 --> 00:50:58.889]  Yeah, so is the NSA.
[00:50:59.130 --> 00:50:59.910]  What do you have to hide?
[00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.910]  Your life.
[00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:01.810]  They want you dead.
[00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:03.051]  They want to know everything about you.
[00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:06.552]  They want to give it all to the AI computers that have become sentient, many believe.
[00:51:10.086 --> 00:51:14.970]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:16.631]  What are bitcoins?
[00:51:17.091 --> 00:51:23.156]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:51:23.576 --> 00:51:25.017]  No bank needed.
[00:51:25.397 --> 00:51:30.681]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:51:31.082 --> 00:51:32.863]  You are in control of your money.
[00:51:33.343 --> 00:51:34.124]  And the best part?
[00:51:34.505 --> 00:51:37.729]  You can start earning and making money with bitcoins right away.
[00:51:38.129 --> 00:51:45.538]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[00:51:45.978 --> 00:51:49.663]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:18.890]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:53:19.311 --> 00:53:23.972]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:53:24.252 --> 00:53:26.153]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:53:26.493 --> 00:53:32.536]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.

[00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:18.012]  Bear and Goliath near and near.
[00:54:18.793 --> 00:54:20.474]  Riders on the storm.
[00:54:21.114 --> 00:54:22.575]  Bear and Goliath near and near.
[00:54:23.196 --> 00:54:25.337]  Into this house we're born.
[00:54:25.657 --> 00:54:27.278]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:54:27.418 --> 00:54:29.639]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:54:32.141 --> 00:54:36.684]  Like a dog without a bone and actor out of love.
[00:54:37.484 --> 00:54:38.785]  Riders on the storm.
[00:54:42.313 --> 00:54:45.235]  I like Spanish Caravan, too.
[00:54:45.255 --> 00:54:48.677]  We've got to play that sometime.
[00:54:48.957 --> 00:54:50.658]  Take A Long Holiday.
[00:54:51.319 --> 00:54:55.201]  From reality to fantasy island.
[00:54:56.322 --> 00:54:58.583]  We've already done that!
[00:55:07.719 --> 00:55:09.741]  Whoa, baby!

[00:55:10.861 --> 00:55:12.482]  Second hour coming up, Dr. Mercola.
[00:55:12.823 --> 00:55:14.844]  Hey, Coke says aspartame's good for you.
[00:55:14.864 --> 00:55:15.565]  Ha!
[00:55:15.925 --> 00:55:18.127]  So I thought we'd actually go over all the real studies.
[00:55:19.267 --> 00:55:23.110]  Hey, if you want to weigh 800 pounds, I guess, and, uh, you know, have diabetes, sure.
[00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.771]  And go blind, I mean, yeah, sure.
[00:55:25.892 --> 00:55:27.253]  What alcohol does wonders for you.
[00:55:27.493 --> 00:55:29.735]  Yeah, it breaks down to that at 87 degrees, and our body's 98.9.
[00:55:29.775 --> 00:55:29.975]  Isn't it?
[00:55:29.995 --> 00:55:30.075]  Yeah.
[00:55:33.629 --> 00:55:35.011]  98.6.
[00:55:33.669 --> 00:55:35.011]  People vary.
[00:55:36.113 --> 00:55:35.011]  98.7.
[00:55:36.814 --> 00:55:41.663]  Boy, I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, I'm also going to get into the whole rodeo clown situation.
[00:55:41.683 --> 00:55:42.324]  This is all about
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:55.602]  You know, we can abort half the black people in this country and have a eugenics operation and take everybody's basic liberties and freedoms, but we're going to get you obsessed over a rodeo clown and have the NAACP calling for criminal investigations.
[00:55:55.962 --> 00:56:00.723]  So I did a video yesterday, live on the air, we have the clip of it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:00.823 --> 00:56:04.584]  Alex Jones received Obama clown sensitivity training.
[00:56:05.784 --> 00:56:08.185]  That's satire, but it ties into the real article by Kurt Nemo.
[00:56:10.094 --> 00:56:13.255]  NAACP attacks rodeo stunt and political satire.
[00:56:13.495 --> 00:56:14.855]  Yeah, attacks free speech is what it's doing.
[00:56:15.756 --> 00:56:20.017]  Drudge Report really has all the news on this over on their left-hand side, all of it together.
[00:56:20.637 --> 00:56:21.477]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:56:21.517 --> 00:56:22.798]  But you notice this is Missouri.
[00:56:23.438 --> 00:56:27.219]  And a bunch of other states have these truth squads that are these tattletale squads.
[00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:33.041]  And they tell them now, this is five years ago, I'm about to play the clip, that if you hear anybody criticize the president, call the police.
[00:56:34.204 --> 00:56:37.706]  And I know a lot of people who have the Secret Service visit him for just saying they hate Obama.
[00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:40.288]  And again, Obama's the front man of the bad agenda.
[00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:45.011]  But still, folks, you have a right to criticize the president.
[00:56:45.892 --> 00:56:47.033]  You were born with that right.
[00:56:47.073 --> 00:56:50.655]  It's patriotic to love your country but to fear and dislike your government.
[00:56:51.536 --> 00:56:54.097]  And so I thought I'd play a short clip of the Missouri Truth Squads.
[00:56:54.798 --> 00:56:56.239]  And by the way, more newscasts came out.
[00:56:56.279 --> 00:57:01.822]  They would actually go to people's houses and threaten to arrest him if they said he was a Muslim or wasn't born here.
[00:57:02.043 --> 00:57:03.764]  Well, even if that's true or not true,
[00:57:05.987 --> 00:57:28.352]  The point is, you have a right to say, you know, Barack Obama is an Easter Bunny, or Barack Obama, you know, something that's true, his dad was a famous communist pornographer from Hawaii, so they created the whole fake Kenya thing and said he was born there, in all his own literature, so we thought, well, you say you were born in Kenya, in all your Harvard literature, and all your book deals, but then now you say you aren't, and your wife's on video saying you were born there.
[00:57:29.838 --> 00:57:31.820]  But now you say you never said that and we're crazy?
[00:57:32.341 --> 00:57:33.241]  Oh, it's a bait and switch!
[00:57:33.261 --> 00:57:39.608]  You're really the son of a famous communist pornographer and your mother's in the pornography publicly.
[00:57:39.928 --> 00:57:42.151]  Look at the president's mother all bent over.
[00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:45.554]  But again, that's all part of just breaking America down.
[00:57:45.574 --> 00:57:47.096]  Just what will we put up with?
[00:57:47.176 --> 00:57:52.001]  It's all like Wiener up there and the whole rise of that.
[00:57:52.521 --> 00:57:55.602]  That big debacle that's finally now shrinking, thank goodness.
[00:57:56.223 --> 00:57:59.804]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip to remind you that this is where this comes from.
[00:58:00.024 --> 00:58:02.585]  The NAACP calling for the Secret Service.
[00:58:02.885 --> 00:58:10.188]  The bull they said was going to charge our precious one that's ripping everybody off and scamming everyone as a front man.
[00:58:10.348 --> 00:58:11.089]  Let's go to this clip.
[00:58:11.129 --> 00:58:11.389]  Here it is.
[00:58:12.205 --> 00:58:21.629]  Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign.
[00:58:21.649 --> 00:58:24.530]  This morning, John Mills is live at the county election board in Maplewood.
[00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:29.233]  He's been learning more about which members of law enforcement are getting involved in this.
[00:58:29.253 --> 00:58:30.153]  John, tell us more about this.
[00:58:30.939 --> 00:58:31.559]  Russell, good evening.
[00:58:31.639 --> 00:58:33.980]  Prosecutors and sheriffs... Let's stop there.
[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:34.680]  Let's stop there.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:41.482]  The full clip's on Infowars.com, and I'll get to it more in the next hour after Mercola joins us.
[00:58:42.422 --> 00:58:46.723]  But we're gonna come back and break down what Diet Soda's really doing to you, and a lot more.
[00:58:52.164 --> 00:58:56.125]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:02.471 --> 01:00:04.372]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.853 --> 01:00:07.614]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.264 --> 01:00:18.448]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:19.088 --> 01:00:19.909]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.689 --> 01:00:21.570]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.231 --> 01:00:25.794]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:30.518]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:47.952 --> 01:00:59.897]  Joseph Mercola is going to be joining us to break down, coming up in the start of the next segment after we cover some other news, Coke to defend safety of aspartame in new ad.
[01:01:01.197 --> 01:01:07.140]  It'd be like a headline, you know, cigarette makers to defend safety of cigarettes in new ad.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:14.263]  I mean, it's exactly parallel with that, except for my own research and all the medical doctors and people I've had on, I think aspartame probably
[01:01:15.445 --> 01:01:17.587]  Statistically, it may even be worse than cigarettes.
[01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:35.423]  And, of course, it is a by-product of a genetically engineered E. coli bacteria that puts out this very sweet molecule, chain of molecules, and when it breaks down at 87 degrees, turns into one part wood alcohol, the other part basically formaldehyde.
[01:01:35.763 --> 01:01:41.369]  So Dr. Joseph Mercola, one of the leading, probably the leading health experts out there,
[01:01:42.536 --> 01:01:47.176]  We'll be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:55.033]  And then we are also going to continue with Ben Swan, launching his own media platform.
[01:01:55.213 --> 01:02:00.635]  He was interested in coming to work here, but I never really, we never got deep into that, because I thought, you know, he'd probably do his own thing.
[01:02:01.336 --> 01:02:07.839]  And then down the road, we can just self-promote, you know, each other, because I'm into synergy, and he's just such a great reporter.
[01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:11.241]  I want to get his take on all the big scandals and things that are going on.
[01:02:11.281 --> 01:02:12.822]  His Kickstarter campaign failed.
[01:02:13.462 --> 01:02:18.424]  When I saw it, that it was $1,250,000, I thought it would probably fail.
[01:02:20.085 --> 01:02:31.270]  Not that you don't need that much to start something, you need more than that to really out of the gates, boom, do a nightly internet TV show for everybody that's high quality and produced.
[01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:33.931]  I mean, that's the problem.
[01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:42.115]  I mean, it took me a decade, a decade spending almost everything I had.
[01:02:44.483 --> 01:02:46.324]  I mean, just, you know, absolutely.
[01:02:46.344 --> 01:02:47.945]  Like, I didn't go out and buy a new car.
[01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:52.489]  You know, I had cars that, like, you know, was constantly breaking.
[01:02:52.529 --> 01:02:55.151]  I finally got a newer car just because I was sick of things breaking all the time.
[01:02:55.211 --> 01:02:56.572]  It became more of a hassle.
[01:02:56.592 --> 01:03:09.301]  But the point is, I just put, I don't know, 95% of the money I had coming in for a decade into, you know, back into the operation.
[01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:10.662]  All the discretionary income.
[01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:17.078]  And we've built this operation, and I didn't mean to segue off into that.
[01:03:17.098 --> 01:03:24.704]  It's just that I hope people realize that as crazy as the stuff we talk about here sounds, you notice almost all of us now come out in the open.
[01:03:24.844 --> 01:03:28.987]  And now I can even talk about things that I don't talk about as much because...
[01:03:29.767 --> 01:03:39.890]  It just sounds so over the top that for 30 years they've been implanting trackable microchips, uh, really longer than 30 years, uh, in spies, CIA, special forces people.
[01:03:40.491 --> 01:03:43.111]  And now they're doing all sorts of medical experiments on these guys.
[01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:47.753]  They get them to sign off on and MIT admits those programs are going on with DARPA.
[01:03:48.633 --> 01:03:51.034]  University of Texas runs some of them as well.
[01:03:52.815 --> 01:03:53.355]  And, um,
[01:03:57.239 --> 01:04:01.642]  I really gotta be careful, actually, because they do persecute so many whistleblowers nowadays.
[01:04:01.842 --> 01:04:04.664]  I don't think they want to come after me because they don't want to give me that much attention.
[01:04:05.404 --> 01:04:06.405]  I'm not their target.
[01:04:06.445 --> 01:04:09.947]  You know, that would give me too much attention if they came and said I was releasing classified info.
[01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:14.450]  So much of this I learned from classified sources, but a lot of it's open source as well.
[01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:15.351]  I could then confirm it.
[01:04:16.011 --> 01:04:18.593]  Pieces of it open source, public sector.
[01:04:19.887 --> 01:04:23.149]  Above the underground technological system.
[01:04:23.489 --> 01:04:24.549]  And I mean that figuratively.
[01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:31.233]  But still, I don't think people are ready to hear it all.
[01:04:32.453 --> 01:04:34.154]  I think the media would have a field day with it.
[01:04:35.295 --> 01:04:36.575]  But let's just say this.
[01:04:36.935 --> 01:04:42.658]  History, our civilization, everything you see, my friends, a lot of it's not as you've been told.
[01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:44.579]  A lot of it is not as it seems.
[01:04:48.208 --> 01:04:49.009]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:04:49.049 --> 01:04:54.552]  We're going to come back and get into the establishment striking back.
[01:04:55.113 --> 01:04:58.715]  A record plunge in the sales of things containing aspartame.
[01:04:59.256 --> 01:05:08.442]  So their answer to that is to spike the entire food chain with it so that you cannot escape the neurological excitotoxin chemical weapon.
[01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:13.486]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:05:13.726 --> 01:05:19.009]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:26.793]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:05:26.973 --> 01:05:36.078]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:05:36.278 --> 01:05:43.288]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:05:43.469 --> 01:05:46.333]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:05:46.513 --> 01:05:52.301]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[01:05:53.142 --> 01:05:53.663]  A war.
[01:05:53.843 --> 01:05:54.863]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:05:54.883 --> 01:05:56.064]  Another plane just hit!
[01:06:10.157 --> 01:06:17.482]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[01:06:17.923 --> 01:06:21.726]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:35.736]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[01:06:36.296 --> 01:06:38.218]  It can even purify water!

[01:07:12.822 --> 01:07:20.409]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:07:20.849 --> 01:07:25.513]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:07:25.793 --> 01:07:27.715]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:07:27.955 --> 01:07:31.078]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves,
[01:07:31.358 --> 01:07:34.082]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[01:07:34.362 --> 01:07:42.171]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:48.899]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.

[01:08:15.036 --> 01:08:20.239]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:30.464 --> 01:08:35.326]  Dr. Joseph Mercola will be joining us here in about five minutes.
[01:08:37.315 --> 01:08:45.858]  To break down the big national headlines out of the Associated Press, Coke to defend safety of aspartame in new ad.
[01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:55.602]  And this is like saying, Coke to defend the safety of cigarettes, or Coke to defend the safety of, there's hands down no debate what aspartame does.
[01:08:58.383 --> 01:09:01.985]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[01:09:03.089 --> 01:09:03.489]  With him.
[01:09:03.509 --> 01:09:15.936]  And there's another study out here that NaturalNews.com has, we have it up on InfoWars.com, that Mike Adams breaks down, where mortality rate doubles for females eating refined white sugar.
[01:09:16.397 --> 01:09:18.878]  Lab mice study rocks soda industry.
[01:09:19.178 --> 01:09:20.439]  So it's not just the aspartame.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.763]  But from my research, and not my research, the research I've done on the mainline research is that
[01:09:27.603 --> 01:09:29.566]  Aspartame is even worse than refined sugar.
[01:09:29.967 --> 01:09:34.754]  I just know if I let my kids eat refined sugar, they don't look as healthy for like two days.
[01:09:35.967 --> 01:09:39.430]  There's like birthday parties every week, and I'm like, no, they can't go to a birthday party.
[01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:40.291]  And I'm like, come on.
[01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:42.713]  I know we feed them organic all the time, but they want to go see their friends.
[01:09:42.733 --> 01:09:46.776]  And then for like a day, they're like wiped out after it, from eating the big piece of cake.
[01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:51.420]  I mean, if I eat a piece of cake, I feel like I had like 10 shots of Jack Daniels the next morning.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.841]  I have a hangover from it.
[01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:55.863]  Literally, I won't drink anything, and then I'll eat a piece of cake.
[01:09:55.883 --> 01:09:57.765]  I'm like, oh, I have a headache the next day.
[01:09:57.785 --> 01:09:59.927]  I mean, no wonder this is going on.
[01:10:00.967 --> 01:10:02.128]  And then you still just do it.
[01:10:02.168 --> 01:10:03.730]  You're like, oh, here, you know.
[01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:07.612]  Let my son have some ice cream last night after we went out water skiing.
[01:10:08.272 --> 01:10:09.573]  And I was just, why did I do that?
[01:10:09.853 --> 01:10:11.654]  It's a double whammy.
[01:10:12.354 --> 01:10:14.375]  It's actually child abuse, man, I'm telling you.
[01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:17.657]  But it's not just that, it's the highly processed stuff, so.
[01:10:19.478 --> 01:10:22.340]  No, no, yelling at your kid to make him behave, that's child abuse.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.101]  Poisoning him, that's okay, the government says.
[01:10:24.361 --> 01:10:25.962]  Put him on Ritalin, Prozac, that's a good thing.
[01:10:26.202 --> 01:10:28.363]  Okay, enough of that, that's coming up with Mercola in a minute.
[01:10:29.827 --> 01:10:34.068]  I mean, this whole rodeo clown thing, I'm going to get to more after he leaves us.
[01:10:34.268 --> 01:10:36.468]  Missouri has something called Truth Squads.
[01:10:36.488 --> 01:10:43.049]  We probably need to get a whole article out on this, because even though this is five-and-a-half-year-old news, this is what was involved here.
[01:10:43.089 --> 01:10:58.332]  The tattletales went and called the press, and then now the Secret Service is involved, because a man dressed like a clown, a rodeo clown, was taunting the bull, and then the announcer was saying, will that bull get him?
[01:10:59.434 --> 01:11:02.316]  Folks, anybody who's been to a rodeo knows that's what you do.
[01:11:02.757 --> 01:11:11.064]  They say, oh, the bull's trying to get him and they jump in the barrel and then the bull runs into it and you jump out of the barrel and the rodeo clowns are there to protect the...
[01:11:13.482 --> 01:11:24.044]  Bull riders when they fall off so they don't get stomped and killed, and then it's become its own exhibition of daredevil itself, kind of like running with the bulls or something in Spain.
[01:11:24.404 --> 01:11:30.545]  And undoubtedly people don't like Obama trying to take their guns and de-industrializing the country and trying to federalize the farmers.
[01:11:30.906 --> 01:11:34.866]  Of course rural areas don't like Obama, but it's more because of his policies.
[01:11:35.346 --> 01:11:37.647]  I guarantee you we had a black president that was constitutional.
[01:11:38.747 --> 01:11:41.288]  He would be worshipped at a mainly white rodeo.
[01:11:41.588 --> 01:11:42.649]  I guarantee it.
[01:11:43.789 --> 01:11:57.255]  But the whole point is that they want to invoke racial division in Divide and Conquer, just like Oprah Winfrey went in and said, I want to see the $35,000 purse in the locked case that was a display.
[01:11:58.216 --> 01:12:00.237]  And the woman said, no, you've got to wait.
[01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:05.659]  She was a part-time Italian employee, didn't even really speak English, said you got to wait till the manager gets here.
[01:12:07.936 --> 01:12:17.565]  And I mean, I'll assure you folks that most of those type of places, they don't just let anybody, I don't care if you're black or white, come in and look at the $35,000 purse.
[01:12:17.605 --> 01:12:21.588]  Plus, it just shows the insane decadence of Oprah Winfrey wanting a $35,000 purse.
[01:12:21.668 --> 01:12:25.211]  And what do you want to bet she's got hundreds of purses?
[01:12:26.012 --> 01:12:27.754]  Hundreds of purses in her closets.
[01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:38.343]  And this is a woman who lobbies for Obamacare, lobbies for higher taxes on the middle class, and then she's a globalist that meets with Bill Gates to talk about population reduction, mainly in the black community.
[01:12:40.284 --> 01:12:45.747]  She's been put in her media position to create racial division, and Oprah Winfrey is disgusting.
[01:12:47.012 --> 01:12:47.733]  Absolutely.
[01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:55.799]  Hey, Oprah, why don't you do a story on 51% of blacks being aborted when the other groups aren't even in the double digits?
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:01.844]  And how it targets blacks to get rid of them by the liberal so-called establishment, the eugenicists.
[01:13:02.104 --> 01:13:06.108]  Why don't you talk about Obama doubling money for basically forced abortions in Africa?
[01:13:07.245 --> 01:13:07.805]  Oh no, no.
[01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:10.786]  Killing black babies is not an issue with you.
[01:13:11.066 --> 01:13:17.088]  Or you enforce vaccine programs in Africa where they've caught them adding hormones to the tetanus shots and then sterilizes the women.
[01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:19.309]  I guess to your view, there are too many people.
[01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.969]  No, no.
[01:13:20.069 --> 01:13:33.834]  Someone not showing you a $35,000 handbag that didn't know who you were and didn't speak English in a foreign country, that is the big issue for all of us to feel pity for you and your $5 billion or $6 billion.
[01:13:33.874 --> 01:13:34.654]  How much is she worth?
[01:13:35.015 --> 01:13:35.835]  Last time I checked?
[01:13:37.386 --> 01:13:39.113]  I mean, I am just sick and tired of it!
[01:13:40.711 --> 01:13:47.456]  But they need us to worry about our sexual preference, or I'm being abused how you looked at me.
[01:13:48.296 --> 01:13:54.601]  Don't say brown bagging in Seattle, or you'll be fired in any government job, because brown bagging is racist.
[01:13:54.621 --> 01:13:55.722]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:13:56.042 --> 01:14:00.145]  It means the paper brown bags everybody used to go to school when they were kids, or work.
[01:14:00.585 --> 01:14:01.446]  Hey, I'm getting lunch today.
[01:14:01.466 --> 01:14:02.126]  You want me to get you lunch?
[01:14:02.326 --> 01:14:03.247]  No, I'm brown bagging it.
[01:14:03.887 --> 01:14:05.368]  Oh, whoa, CJ.
[01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:07.130]  Whoa, Chris.
[01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:08.511]  All of you before have brown bagged it.
[01:14:09.855 --> 01:14:12.819]  We got black folks, Hispanics, white folks working, you've all brown bagged it.
[01:14:12.999 --> 01:14:14.401]  You're all racist, you're all fired!
[01:14:15.595 --> 01:14:16.895]  I'm telling you, I'm racist too.
[01:14:16.935 --> 01:14:18.776]  My mom, I didn't know my mom was a racist.
[01:14:19.376 --> 01:14:22.357]  My mom was what you'd call a mainline, you know, real liberal.
[01:14:22.637 --> 01:14:30.479]  Kind of in the Thomas Jefferson vein when I was growing up that it's the character of people's deeds and what they stand for and racism is bad and let's watch Kill a Bocking Bird on TV.
[01:14:31.219 --> 01:14:39.181]  And I didn't know that she used to send me with the cheap brown bags to school with a sandwich and chips and carrot sticks.
[01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:41.582]  My mother, my mother hated black people.
[01:14:43.215 --> 01:14:45.237]  And by the way, we've got to get rid of the clown's red hair.
[01:14:45.317 --> 01:14:46.478]  That's against red-headed folks.
[01:14:46.939 --> 01:14:49.020]  And the red nose, that's against alcoholics.
[01:14:49.941 --> 01:14:56.867]  No, no, really, they dress up like clowns because the bulls see the red and chase after them as all the bulls can see is black and white with some spectrum of red.
[01:14:57.825 --> 01:15:00.206]  Okay, and so it gets them all excited.
[01:15:00.867 --> 01:15:02.568]  But the bull is racist as well.
[01:15:02.908 --> 01:15:04.649]  It was going to try to run over the Obama clown.
[01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:07.110]  And so don't worry, he's been fired, he's been banned.
[01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:09.271]  He can't get a job now on the rodeo in that state.
[01:15:09.931 --> 01:15:12.713]  And they're talking about nationwide bans and his arrest.
[01:15:13.133 --> 01:15:15.474]  Because we're land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:15:15.494 --> 01:15:17.175]  So we're going to be getting into the truth squads.
[01:15:17.415 --> 01:15:19.336]  We have the video up on Infowars.com.
[01:15:19.796 --> 01:15:21.417]  Somebody ought to write an article about the truth squads.
[01:15:21.437 --> 01:15:25.980]  We just have the video up there, but we're going to play that in the next hour after
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.663]  We're going to cover a lot of news with Ben Swann when he joins us, the award-winning Edward R. Murrow-winning reporter.
[01:15:32.683 --> 01:15:33.404]  He's won two of those.
[01:15:33.664 --> 01:15:36.466]  Just a great guy to have him be an awake constitutionalist.
[01:15:36.826 --> 01:15:41.829]  He's going to be joining us to cover the entire waterfront, a cornucopia of issues, in the next hour.
[01:15:43.168 --> 01:15:45.469]  We've got a lot of geopolitical issues we're going to be getting into.
[01:15:45.509 --> 01:15:48.490]  The army shooting more of the Muslim Al-Qaeda Brotherhood people.
[01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:51.932]  It's just a terrible situation and our government's backing the Al-Qaeda forces.
[01:15:52.272 --> 01:15:55.774]  I don't support the military shooting them either, but this is all the globalists meddling.
[01:15:56.294 --> 01:15:59.616]  Divide and conquer, full-spectrum dominance, stuff that caused this.
[01:16:00.716 --> 01:16:01.617]  But that said,
[01:16:02.816 --> 01:16:14.863]  I want to shift gears now for the balance of the hour with Dr. Joseph Mercola, the leading alternative health advocate and researcher in the country.
[01:16:15.885 --> 01:16:17.447]  And he really doesn't need any introduction.
[01:16:17.507 --> 01:16:18.548]  Mercola.com.
[01:16:18.568 --> 01:16:20.249]  We're going to go to him in just a moment.
[01:16:20.269 --> 01:16:23.192]  But I wanted to first tell you why we got him on today.
[01:16:23.932 --> 01:16:25.113]  It's so funny, the synergy.
[01:16:25.173 --> 01:16:26.555]  I said, I want to get Mercola on.
[01:16:26.575 --> 01:16:27.936]  And Chris goes, it's funny.
[01:16:27.976 --> 01:16:29.257]  They sent us an email saying he's available.
[01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:30.218]  He's usually not available.
[01:16:30.638 --> 01:16:33.041]  I guess this got him so upset that he can come on the show.
[01:16:33.321 --> 01:16:34.362]  He's a very busy guy.
[01:16:35.082 --> 01:16:39.566]  But Coke to defend safety of aspartame in new ad.
[01:16:39.606 --> 01:16:40.767]  This is Associated Press.
[01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:47.127]  And then we have another study out, mortality rate doubles for females eating refined white sugar.
[01:16:47.507 --> 01:16:50.589]  That story's up on InfoWars.com for Mike Adams and Natural News.
[01:16:50.969 --> 01:16:52.830]  So all of this is coming out.
[01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:55.552]  So you're in trouble if you do, you're in trouble if you don't.
[01:16:55.892 --> 01:17:03.976]  But what's amazing is they had big studies come out this year, scientific mainline studies, that aspartame's connected to increasing obesity and hunger.
[01:17:04.276 --> 01:17:07.138]  Everything Dr. Blalock, a brain surgeon's talked about here.
[01:17:07.518 --> 01:17:10.720]  The excitotoxin, just like MSG.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:14.183]  And Dr. Mercola, of course, goes over that.
[01:17:14.643 --> 01:17:16.344]  He's a New York Times best-selling author.
[01:17:16.384 --> 01:17:21.148]  Dr. Mercola also voted 2009 Ultimate Wellness Game Changer by the Huffington Post.
[01:17:21.549 --> 01:17:24.732]  Has been featured in Time Magazine, LA Times, ABC News.
[01:17:24.772 --> 01:17:26.373]  I'm not going to go over it all.
[01:17:27.094 --> 01:17:28.855]  And we're honored to have him on with us.
[01:17:29.255 --> 01:17:31.637]  I tell you, this is really getting outrageous.
[01:17:33.139 --> 01:17:34.621]  And what does this signify?
[01:17:34.681 --> 01:17:36.403]  Because for me it means we're starting to have a victory.
[01:17:37.084 --> 01:17:42.029]  Because they say our sales are plummeting, so we've got to come out and say it's good for you.
[01:17:42.249 --> 01:17:43.191]  What's really happening here?
[01:17:45.573 --> 01:17:47.375]  Well, Wilk, thank you for having me Alex.
[01:17:47.395 --> 01:17:47.956]  Thank you, sir.
[01:17:47.976 --> 01:17:48.256]  You bet.
[01:17:49.719 --> 01:17:53.483]  I think the big issue is, and I would agree with you, that I think we are winning.
[01:17:53.523 --> 01:18:08.320]  Their sales of all sodas are down 3% and diet sodas are down 6%, which is what the impetus for the campaign is, which launches in the Atlanta Constitution tomorrow and in Chicago, my hometown, next week.
[01:18:09.301 --> 01:18:27.171]  So, I think it's a phenomenal sign of victory we are making to death because when I have someone who's new to health and doesn't understand how to apply these natural principles, the very first recommendation I make is to stop drinking soda because Americans drink 56 gallons of soda.
[01:18:27.911 --> 01:18:34.115]  And, you know, people intuitively know that sugar is not good for them and then when they see diet, they think that's healthier.
[01:18:34.855 --> 01:18:40.359]  But the sad challenge here, Alex, is that they should be really sued for fraud.
[01:18:40.379 --> 01:18:45.963]  The FTC should sue these companies for fraud because it is not in any way, shape, or form diet.
[01:18:46.183 --> 01:18:48.946]  They have no studies supporting that claim.
[01:18:49.326 --> 01:18:54.570]  Yet, when we make a claim that is substantiated by literature, the FDA writes us letters.
[01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.631]  But they have no support for this.
[01:18:56.671 --> 01:19:02.616]  In fact, the studies that looked at weight loss with the use of these diet products show that, in fact, there is no weight loss.
[01:19:02.636 --> 01:19:03.977]  And if anything, there's weight gain.
[01:19:06.024 --> 01:19:31.877]  Now, you know, you yourself as an MD, as an osteopath, who began to awaken to this decades ago, how frustrating is it for you, who reads the peer-reviewed mainline studies about Coke, you know, aspartame making you get fatter, it's now in tens of thousands of products, people just know it's in these diet soft drinks so they're staying away from it, how frustrating is it to see them come out with a bold-faced lie saying that aspartame isn't bad for you?
[01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:33.838]  Because I'm showing Associated Press
[01:19:34.498 --> 01:19:42.969]  I'm showing articles here, CBS News, where they're admitting that, okay, this stuff in studies does make you get fatter.
[01:19:43.429 --> 01:19:46.072]  So I guess this is the empire striking back.
[01:19:47.270 --> 01:20:00.716]  Yes, as I said initially, I think it's a really great sign that we can see that they're having to resort to these types of measures to exaggerate and give these myths truths to boost their sales.
[01:20:00.836 --> 01:20:10.641]  I think it shows that we're winning, that our campaigns... I've been speaking about this for 17 years on the website and warning people about this and it's finally starting to click in.
[01:20:11.021 --> 01:20:15.322]  You know, as you mentioned earlier, we have one of the largest natural health websites in the world.
[01:20:15.382 --> 01:20:20.983]  So we have a unique position to evaluate the search trends coming into our site.
[01:20:21.023 --> 01:20:29.125]  And Alex, you may not be aware of this, but the number one search term that people come to Mercola.com for is the very word aspartame.
[01:20:29.685 --> 01:20:32.845]  We have two of the top five articles on the Internet for that.
[01:20:33.466 --> 01:20:35.306]  And the reason they're doing that
[01:20:36.184 --> 01:20:40.469]  Is because they know that there's something wrong with this.
[01:20:40.489 --> 01:20:44.154]  This is their first step, their toe into the water for natural medicine.
[01:20:44.194 --> 01:20:47.898]  So I think it's a phenomenal sign that they have to resort to these types of measures.
[01:20:47.938 --> 01:20:49.080]  I'm very excited to see it.
[01:20:51.542 --> 01:21:06.373]  Looking at this, I mean, this is really the triumph in the last 60, 70 years with all these drugs, really, all these additives they put in things to make people eat more, to make them become addicted, and then obviously the medical establishment doesn't care because it just brings them more patients and more treatments.
[01:21:07.173 --> 01:21:20.323]  I mean, this is just a classic problem-reaction-solution paradigm, but it's got to, you know, really upset those that have the triumph of propaganda that they could sell the PR that this stuff was safe
[01:21:21.103 --> 01:21:26.866]  And that now all those lies in the case of aspartame have proved in what, 1981, that it's beginning to all cave in.
[01:21:27.707 --> 01:21:29.508]  Yes, as I said, I think it's exciting.
[01:21:29.548 --> 01:21:37.612]  And some of the reasons that, for those of your listeners who may not be aware of some of the dangers of aspartame, you know, it's promoted as being safe.
[01:21:38.353 --> 01:21:44.416]  Because in one, intuitively it makes sense, because supposedly all they do is combine two amino acids, they link them together,
[01:21:44.796 --> 01:21:46.137]  Thank you for having me.
[01:22:07.537 --> 01:22:17.845]  And because it is transferred in your body and it goes to these nerves that bypasses the blood-brain barrier and convert it to formaldehyde, sort of a Trojan horse.
[01:22:18.245 --> 01:22:21.928]  And that formaldehyde is really toxic to your body.
[01:22:21.948 --> 01:22:28.913]  It has been linked to increased risk of cancers, seizures, migraines, autoimmune disorders, headaches.
[01:22:30.534 --> 01:22:35.858]  It's just a pernicious substance that in no way, shape, or form should ever be consumed by anyone.
[01:22:35.878 --> 01:22:36.719]  There's no excuse for it.
[01:22:36.739 --> 01:22:37.860]  There's no benefit to it.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.361]  It's all a downside.
[01:22:40.421 --> 01:22:51.770]  Dr. Mercola, I want to expand on what the real studies that you have upon your site break down and try to give us just a ballpark how many there are because it seems like I've seen over the years just dozens a year.
[01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:56.433]  It's got to be in the hundreds, you know, not just on this but on the
[01:22:56.853 --> 01:22:57.234]  I don't know.
[01:23:14.532 --> 01:23:16.074]  I mean, this is really incredible.
[01:23:16.515 --> 01:23:27.090]  I think as all this comes out, and as the empire strikes back, we should be talking about not them removing it out of the tens of thousands of foods they've now put it in, but how about arresting some of these people?
[01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:28.432]  How about investigations?
[01:23:28.472 --> 01:23:31.316]  Because, I mean, this is like a holocaust that's going on.
[01:23:32.932 --> 01:23:40.738]  You know, it seems like tens of thousands of foods, certainly, but I think it's only about six, a little over six thousand, maybe seven or eight thousand.
[01:23:41.198 --> 01:23:42.579]  And they increase it all the time.
[01:23:42.599 --> 01:23:43.380]  But it's pervasive.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:43.740]  You're right.
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:44.501]  It's in everything.
[01:23:44.521 --> 01:23:49.124]  And if you go to the grocery store, I was kind of shocked one day just because I was traveling.
[01:23:49.144 --> 01:23:50.145]  I want to get some water.
[01:23:50.165 --> 01:23:51.586]  And I said, oh, here's a flavored water.
[01:23:51.646 --> 01:23:52.867]  I thought my friend might like this.
[01:23:52.907 --> 01:23:58.672]  And if you read the label in very tiny font, probably two point font is virtually unreadable because it's in white.
[01:23:59.312 --> 01:24:00.193]  Thanks for watching.
[01:24:15.746 --> 01:24:16.587]  I don't think so.
[01:24:33.883 --> 01:24:46.447]  And we try to present it in simple language that people understand and communicate because these medical studies are really complicated and they use very sophisticated technical jargon that makes it essentially incomprehensible.
[01:24:46.527 --> 01:24:48.468]  So try to provide that and we've got
[01:24:48.908 --> 01:24:51.531]  We do two articles a day, so that's 700 articles a year.
[01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:58.939]  Our site's been up for 17 years, so we've got thousands of studies that we document, and we actually link back to the regular literature.
[01:24:58.979 --> 01:25:03.865]  So if someone questions what our conclusions are, they can go back to the original study, read it themselves,
[01:25:04.385 --> 01:25:04.946]  Sure, sure.
[01:25:05.346 --> 01:25:10.189]  I mean, years ago I'd see the number of 5,000, 6,000 foods, and recently I saw it's estimated it could be over 10,000.
[01:25:10.529 --> 01:25:15.573]  But I can't find regular gum that's, you know, even regular sugar that doesn't have it.
[01:25:15.913 --> 01:25:18.595]  I can't almost, I mean, it's in everything now.
[01:25:18.715 --> 01:25:19.916]  It is insane.
[01:25:20.876 --> 01:25:25.700]  Specifically, I've seen the studies on the connection to, what is it, macular degeneration?
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.281]  I mean, you're the doctor, the medical doctor.
[01:25:27.621 --> 01:25:29.402]  What's going on with the eyes and aspartame?
[01:25:29.422 --> 01:25:33.465]  I mean, I'm no rocket scientist, but everybody knows what alcohol makes you go blind.
[01:25:34.445 --> 01:25:35.726]  Yes, there's no question.
[01:25:36.046 --> 01:25:41.369]  I haven't seen any of the studies that show a link between it, but it would make sense because you're right.
[01:25:41.429 --> 01:25:57.459]  It's wood alcohol, it's methanol, and 10% of the product is converted to methanol, and it does readily bypass the blood-brain barrier, so it gets into the brain, and of course the retina is part of the brain, so it wouldn't be surprising to see an increase in the risk of
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:14.027]  Well, I've got a lot of family, you name it, people that work here that know all this and hide it in their desk.
[01:26:14.047 --> 01:26:14.807]  They're allowed to have it.
[01:26:14.847 --> 01:26:16.248]  I mean, I'm a libertarian.
[01:26:16.548 --> 01:26:21.350]  And they know it's bad, but they say, listen, I go into incredible withdrawals.
[01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:22.771]  I know people that have been alcoholics.
[01:26:23.731 --> 01:26:29.693]  And they say I've got to have my diet coked or I have worse, worse withdrawal than I had, you know, when I got off drinking.
[01:26:29.713 --> 01:26:33.414]  These are people that have been, you know, who are in AA and are admitted alcoholics.
[01:26:33.714 --> 01:26:35.755]  Some of mine, not here at the office, but outside work.
[01:26:36.295 --> 01:26:37.415]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:26:37.736 --> 01:26:38.536]  I've had family.
[01:26:39.489 --> 01:26:52.736]  That didn't even drink or use drugs, who had to basically stay in bed for several weeks a few years ago whenever they went off of this, and were just a wreck who was drinking a six-pack of Diet Coke a day.
[01:26:52.936 --> 01:26:55.358]  Dr. Mercola, what's happening here with the addictiveness of this?
[01:26:56.258 --> 01:27:08.388]  Well, certainly there's an addiction to sweets, that's one component, but these drinks, these sweeteners are typically put in sodas, which are loaded with caffeine, which is certainly responsible for many of the withdrawal symptoms.
[01:27:08.909 --> 01:27:22.020]  So, I've seen 20,000 to 30,000 patients in my medical career, so I've got a lot of feedback from patients trying these approaches, and one of the most useful ones in my experience is to
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:31.909]  I've seen people taking a dozen or even two dozen cans of soda a day, but the average person, again, is drinking 56 gallons of soda a year.
[01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:35.953]  So the best way to start this is to go off slowly.
[01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:44.160]  And probably the simple initial strategy is to switch from diet soda to regular soda, because that's far safer.
[01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:45.602]  They're both pernicious.
[01:27:45.662 --> 01:27:46.362]  What about CVS?
[01:27:47.515 --> 01:27:51.077]  Stevia is even better and there are some newer ones on the market now.
[01:27:51.117 --> 01:27:53.658]  I forget their names but they are flavored with stevia.
[01:27:53.718 --> 01:27:54.658]  That would be even better.
[01:27:55.079 --> 01:28:02.882]  But you want to make sure if you're having withdrawal symptoms that you have some caffeine because you gradually have to go off of the caffeine depending on your dose initially.
[01:28:03.022 --> 01:28:06.664]  It may be a few days to a few weeks to avoid the withdrawal symptoms which are coming.
[01:28:06.684 --> 01:28:07.364]  Got it, got it.
[01:28:07.404 --> 01:28:12.446]  So a lot of the withdrawals, the caffeine combined with that, so only go off one drug at a time.
[01:28:12.807 --> 01:28:16.048]  Isn't that the big secret to the last hundred years of food?
[01:28:16.368 --> 01:28:24.271]  As it went from being out of the farmyard, out of the laboratories, you had big pharma with all this extra petrochemical stuff.
[01:28:24.611 --> 01:28:26.552]  They wanted to be able to put this in products.
[01:28:26.792 --> 01:28:27.873]  They knew it was toxic.
[01:28:27.893 --> 01:28:28.933]  They knew it was addictive.
[01:28:29.574 --> 01:28:32.515]  And now we're just waking up to something that's been going on for a very long time.
[01:28:33.737 --> 01:28:34.858]  Well, yes, this is nothing new.
[01:28:34.978 --> 01:28:45.106]  As you mentioned, aspartame was approved in 81, but there's been a gradual, pernicious shift of the whole connection between the food industry, the drug industry, and the government.
[01:28:45.126 --> 01:28:47.548]  It's sort of a collusion by these big multinational corporations.
[01:28:47.568 --> 01:28:47.768]  Sure, sure.
[01:28:47.788 --> 01:28:52.812]  I was talking about MSG and Kentucky Fried Chicken and all the other weird additives that are grandfathered in.
[01:28:52.892 --> 01:29:01.498]  I mean, how do they put a silicone derivative into the fluffing agent in Chicken McNuggets?
[01:29:01.518 --> 01:29:03.360]  I mean, how do they get away with stuff like that?
[01:29:04.983 --> 01:29:10.370]  Well, many of these large corporations have lobbied very effectively to pass laws.
[01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:20.302]  Usually, and you're familiar with this, they typically pass them as amendments to existing legislation, or what appears to be a good piece of legislation.
[01:29:20.602 --> 01:29:22.745]  And they just get their protection that way.
[01:29:22.785 --> 01:29:24.046]  So they're easy to slip in.
[01:29:24.867 --> 01:29:26.909]  They manipulate the whole system to their advantage.
[01:29:45.925 --> 01:29:47.346]  Other health news that's going on.
[01:29:47.366 --> 01:29:48.987]  We're also going to open the phones up.
[01:29:49.007 --> 01:29:49.227]  800-259-9231.
[01:29:49.247 --> 01:29:50.688]  Your questions for Dr. Mercola.
[01:29:50.708 --> 01:29:50.748]  800-259-9231.
[01:29:50.908 --> 01:29:51.389]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:51.409 --> 01:29:52.489]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.549 --> 01:29:53.470]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:30:19.379 --> 01:30:25.782]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:30:26.182 --> 01:30:28.123]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:30:28.463 --> 01:30:29.503]  They're the good guys.

[01:33:26.539 --> 01:33:32.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:33.021 --> 01:33:34.561]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:51.445]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[01:33:52.819 --> 01:33:55.661]  Radiating out the message of truth worldwide.
[01:33:55.681 --> 01:34:00.023]  And it is very positive to see the amount of traffic and listeners to the sites.
[01:34:00.043 --> 01:34:02.765]  I don't know, it's growing over 100% a year.
[01:34:03.806 --> 01:34:04.626]  Exponentially.
[01:34:04.986 --> 01:34:07.988]  But I see that with a lot of other people talking about corruption.
[01:34:08.589 --> 01:34:09.949]  Talking about health freedom.
[01:34:10.009 --> 01:34:12.471]  Talking about political awakening.
[01:34:12.891 --> 01:34:15.413]  Speaking out against NSA illegal spying.
[01:34:15.793 --> 01:34:18.395]  Our government openly funding Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria.
[01:34:18.835 --> 01:34:20.476]  There is the Great Awakening happening.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.741]  The question is, is it happening quick enough?
[01:34:23.761 --> 01:34:30.427]  We're going to go back to Dr. Joseph Mercola here in a minute, probably the leading health advocate on a planetary scale.
[01:34:30.447 --> 01:34:36.011]  There's a lot of other great people out there as well, but he's definitely the number one thorn in their side.
[01:34:36.551 --> 01:34:38.413]  He does it with such a credible way.
[01:34:40.054 --> 01:34:46.702]  I do a lot of credible reporting, have great reporters as well, but I also tend to rabble-rouse, get upset, and so I wake up different people as well.
[01:34:46.742 --> 01:34:50.346]  I mean, it's just all of us taking action are going to bring down this system.
[01:34:50.366 --> 01:34:57.935]  So, if you're a listener out there and you don't like the tyranny that's happening, but don't think you're the best spoken person, or don't have all the answers, it doesn't matter.
[01:34:58.195 --> 01:34:59.536]  Pick your issues, get involved.
[01:35:00.277 --> 01:35:02.659]  And that will frustrate the corrupt forces out there.
[01:35:03.059 --> 01:35:06.522]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:35:06.542 --> 01:35:12.666]  So we're going to go back to Dr. Mercola and get into some of the other big health news that's front and center on his radar.
[01:35:13.366 --> 01:35:14.727]  And then we're going to go to some of your...
[01:35:15.868 --> 01:35:16.728]  Some of your phone calls.
[01:35:16.748 --> 01:35:20.029]  I want to talk about some of the GMO news that's taking place in Europe.
[01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:24.369]  Some of the big companies are abandoning GMO pushes over there, but not here.
[01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:28.590]  America is like the dumping ground for these companies to get away with anything.
[01:35:28.630 --> 01:35:30.531]  I want to talk to Dr. Mercola about that.
[01:35:30.571 --> 01:35:34.791]  But briefly, I want to tell you about some of the amazing sponsors that make this broadcast possible.
[01:35:35.511 --> 01:35:36.351]  SimplySafe.
[01:35:36.431 --> 01:35:39.092]  Everything we promote here, we've researched and believe to be the best out there.
[01:35:39.492 --> 01:35:42.593]  There's some real scum in the alarm industry, folks.
[01:35:42.933 --> 01:35:44.813]  You need to protect your home, but do it right.
[01:35:45.453 --> 01:35:49.114]  Don't ever sign a contract for a freebie alarm.
[01:35:49.654 --> 01:35:57.757]  Learn all the details there on the SimpliSafe website where you can find out all of the details.

[01:36:59.606 --> 01:37:00.226]  Oh, five.
[01:37:00.746 --> 01:37:09.749]  And also, when it comes to health issues, the number one thing I think you can do past getting off soda, like Dr. Mercola just said, is filter your water.
[01:37:10.289 --> 01:37:11.309]  And I've done the research.
[01:37:11.710 --> 01:37:13.710]  We carry the best gravity-fed filters out there.
[01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:19.132]  The ProPure, discounted with promo code water at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:37:19.232 --> 01:37:21.772]  And your purchase there also supports the broadcast.
[01:37:21.812 --> 01:37:26.554]  But we have a lot of other great filtration systems that I think are excellent as well in different price ranges.
[01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:27.254]  But the ProPure,
[01:37:27.694 --> 01:37:30.596]  And it's whole family and the Pro One systems are simply amazing.
[01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:34.800]  That's what I use, what my family uses, what I use in my RV when I'm on the road.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:42.145]  Again, that is InfowarsStore.com or InfowarsShop.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:37:42.305 --> 01:37:45.708]  I want to thank all of you that are supporters of the broadcast.
[01:37:45.728 --> 01:37:46.549]  We couldn't do it without you.
[01:37:46.869 --> 01:37:57.732]  Okay, Dr. Mercola, I want to go to phone calls here so people can bring up some questions they have for you, one of the leading experts out there as a medical doctor that does the research and exposes this.
[01:37:57.752 --> 01:38:06.395]  But first off, what are some other big things that are front and center outside of Coke, who helped get aspartame launched in 1981?
[01:38:07.055 --> 01:38:09.916]  Them coming out and saying, hey, this isn't bad for you.
[01:38:09.936 --> 01:38:13.037]  It's like the cigarette companies saying cigarettes aren't bad for you.
[01:38:13.717 --> 01:38:15.978]  What else is really big and really hot
[01:38:18.199 --> 01:38:22.602]  Well, one of our biggest projects, of course, is Health Liberty, which is in line with your mission, too.
[01:38:23.383 --> 01:38:29.546]  In that arena, we're really focused on labeling genetically modified foods.
[01:38:30.227 --> 01:38:36.451]  I was one of the leading financial contributors for the campaign in California last November.
[01:38:37.231 --> 01:38:53.340]  Prop 37 and we lost by only a few percent but the reality is I think that we lost even though we lost the battle I think we won the war we that all the activity and thank you for your support in that process Alex because there was so much media that
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:02.546]  That around that we actually gained tens of millions of dollars of media exposure which awakened people to this issue.
[01:39:02.726 --> 01:39:09.390]  And that awakening really catalyzed an interest and we are going to defeat them on this.
[01:39:10.571 --> 01:39:15.454]  The next big vote on this will be in Washington in November of this year.
[01:39:15.514 --> 01:39:22.699]  From everything we know at this point, there's a strong probability of winning.
[01:39:23.739 --> 01:39:33.288]  So it's very exciting to see that we're making progress in this area and really starting at the beginning of the end of the control of the seeds that Monsanto has over the world.
[01:39:34.409 --> 01:39:37.692]  I saw an article one of our writers did on PrisonPlanet.com today.
[01:39:37.732 --> 01:39:39.254]  It's not on Infowars for some reason.
[01:39:40.395 --> 01:39:43.498]  That's why it's important to visit both sides, folks, because some news is different on each side.
[01:39:43.538 --> 01:39:44.338]  It's not just a mirror.
[01:39:44.859 --> 01:39:45.760]  Where in Europe,
[01:39:47.252 --> 01:39:53.920]  They are announcing, I think it was four big companies, big food companies from the U.S.
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:59.346]  were announcing they're going to drop pushing GMO over there, but are still going to target us with it.
[01:39:59.366 --> 01:40:02.169]  I mean, it seems like we are having victories across the board.
[01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:05.492]  The problem is they don't stop, at least here.
[01:40:06.053 --> 01:40:08.776]  Why are we so captured in the United States?
[01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:14.924]  Well, it's largely because of the economy here.
[01:40:15.304 --> 01:40:21.349]  There's such large collusion between these industries and the government.
[01:40:21.409 --> 01:40:23.011]  We've done graphs before on our site.
[01:40:23.031 --> 01:40:35.661]  You can just type it in on our website to find the specifics, but there's large numbers of individuals who have either previously worked for Monsanto or even currently employed for them that have this revolving door where they
[01:40:36.201 --> 01:40:52.575]  Go directly from Monsanto into the government and head of large federal regulatory agencies like Michael Taylor and who holds a big role in the regulatory process in the USDA and essentially they control that whole federal system.
[01:40:53.255 --> 01:40:58.802]  That prevents the process from really being done effectively.
[01:40:58.862 --> 01:41:03.188]  But you know, we have direct democracy still in this country, which is phenomenal.
[01:41:03.228 --> 01:41:07.834]  And there's workarounds for this and we can educate people and we can let them know.
[01:41:07.854 --> 01:41:12.039]  It's as you get to the point where if it's labeled, then we'll get to the position that they have in Europe.
[01:41:12.119 --> 01:41:12.460]  Thank you.
[01:41:31.943 --> 01:41:32.824]  We're seeing that here.
[01:41:32.924 --> 01:41:34.445]  There's been an enormous increase.
[01:41:34.785 --> 01:41:44.653]  We've been in discussions with some of the major executives at Whole Foods and they noticed, as a result of November campaign, a doubling to tripling of the purchase of organic foods.
[01:41:45.193 --> 01:41:53.439]  So that motivated them to take an even more aggressive role in this and we're very excited and happy to be working with Whole Foods to have this.
[01:41:53.479 --> 01:41:57.903]  And they actually committed to banning any selling any GMOs for the next five years.
[01:41:58.303 --> 01:42:10.932]  And the reason it took so long to do that is because when you sell meats, you have to go all the way through the supply chain, so it takes years to essentially get that to the point where they're having to feed and everything can be certified.
[01:42:10.992 --> 01:42:27.504]  So many of their foods will be done before that, but it's very exciting to see one of the largest food distributors in the United States of whole foods, of unprocessed foods would be whole foods, and we're glad to have them on board to be working with them.
[01:42:28.243 --> 01:42:29.104]  It's amazing.
[01:42:29.444 --> 01:42:41.577]  I mean, it gives me hope that because the facts in the end, they say a lie goes halfway around the world before a truth puts its shoes on and walks out the front door.
[01:42:41.617 --> 01:42:44.941]  But over time, though, the truth
[01:42:46.212 --> 01:42:48.334]  We'll defeat the lies.
[01:42:48.855 --> 01:43:03.648]  But what do you expect the establishment to do to counteract what Infowars.com is doing, what Mercola.com is doing, what NaturalNews.com and just the hundreds of other great sites that are out there and organizations?
[01:43:04.029 --> 01:43:10.735]  What are they going to do as exponentially we become more popular and trusted, they become more and more unpopular?
[01:43:11.175 --> 01:43:12.897]  All the statistics, the numbers show this.
[01:43:13.157 --> 01:43:15.279]  Mainstream media is dying or dead.
[01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:17.562]  Alternative media is exploding.
[01:43:17.682 --> 01:43:21.005]  All we do is go to the real studies that are already out there and point them out.
[01:43:21.325 --> 01:43:26.611]  I mean, how do you expect these final battles to play out?
[01:43:26.731 --> 01:43:28.512]  And how do you expect them to strike back?
[01:43:29.654 --> 01:43:32.455]  Well, we don't have to expect, all we have to do is observe.
[01:43:33.535 --> 01:43:40.676]  In my case specifically, I've been targeted by the FDA, the FTC, the Better Business Bureau, and the state medical boards.
[01:43:40.716 --> 01:43:47.737]  They've all come after me as a result of opposition and exposure that I've been promoting for these companies.
[01:43:47.797 --> 01:43:50.138]  These are very large multinational corporations.
[01:43:50.578 --> 01:43:53.378]  Tens of billions of dollars in assets at a minimum for most of them.
[01:43:54.258 --> 01:43:56.679]  They're not going to go down easily.
[01:43:59.259 --> 01:44:14.449]  I've actually got PowerPoints of some of the biotechnology conferences where I've got an arrow on my back or a bull's eye on my back along with about half a dozen others who they're targeting us specifically.
[01:44:15.469 --> 01:44:20.913]  And then on a general process, they're clearly going to fight back in the courts.
[01:44:21.113 --> 01:44:31.260]  When we succeed in getting these laws passed, they are going to appeal them to the appropriate appeal judiciary agencies.
[01:44:33.461 --> 01:44:34.662]  So we're anticipating that.
[01:44:34.742 --> 01:44:39.945]  We have long-term plans in place to counteract that.
[01:44:39.985 --> 01:44:42.467]  So they're going to try every trick in the book.
[01:44:42.667 --> 01:44:44.428]  So it's no question about that.
[01:44:44.468 --> 01:44:59.380]  By the way, you don't whine about this, but people need to understand that when we have champions of truth like Dr. Mercola, that through his network gave millions of dollars to the campaign that I believe there was election fraud involved in, but just that fight educated
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.022]  People in the outrage of, I don't get to know if it's GMO.
[01:45:03.122 --> 01:45:04.643]  I don't get to know if it's not organic.
[01:45:05.103 --> 01:45:08.826]  You don't want me to know milk doesn't have hormones in it that are artificial.
[01:45:09.146 --> 01:45:14.990]  So my daughter's nine feet tall or whatever, I'm being sarcastic, or girl's going to puberty at seven, or my boy, you know, never matures.
[01:45:15.010 --> 01:45:16.631]  I mean, you don't want me to know.
[01:45:16.651 --> 01:45:23.615]  I mean, at a fundamental level, the injustice, like telling Rosa Parks she couldn't sit at the front of the bus, is so palpable.
[01:45:23.895 --> 01:45:26.357]  But folks have to understand, Mercola is at the tip of the spear.
[01:45:26.917 --> 01:45:27.337]  Yeah.
[01:45:44.864 --> 01:45:49.167]  Fifteen years ago, if you said, you know, they made Agent Orange to hurt people, they'd sue you.
[01:45:49.447 --> 01:45:51.269]  Even though that was on record, Monsanto did it.
[01:45:51.469 --> 01:45:52.650]  They would do it as a slap suit.
[01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:57.033]  Now there's so many people fighting them and others that they can't get us all.
[01:45:57.073 --> 01:45:57.793]  And here's the answer.
[01:45:58.374 --> 01:45:59.455]  All of us have to stand up.
[01:45:59.655 --> 01:46:00.696]  All of us have to speak out.
[01:46:01.136 --> 01:46:02.417]  All of us have to get aggressive.
[01:46:02.857 --> 01:46:03.538]  But realize...
[01:46:04.298 --> 01:46:10.184]  That tactic's beating them, but they'll still try to cut off the biggest head of the Hydra of Liberty, like Dr. Mercola.
[01:46:10.624 --> 01:46:12.626]  So, support Dr. Mercola.
[01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:16.710]  And he didn't know I'd do this today, but, I mean, we gotta hang together or hang separate, folks.
[01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:18.251]  This is a big deal here.
[01:46:18.912 --> 01:46:20.634]  I couldn't agree more, Alex.
[01:46:20.954 --> 01:46:23.636]  And I realized that many years ago, that we have to work collectively.
[01:46:23.676 --> 01:46:26.219]  And that was the beautiful thing about the GMO project, is that
[01:46:26.519 --> 01:46:32.326]  It really brought all these disparate groups, people on the left, people on the right, people in the center, fighting for the same cause.
[01:46:32.706 --> 01:46:38.613]  And that was one of the reasons why we're so successful, because it really caused people to bind together.
[01:46:38.633 --> 01:46:40.635]  And I think I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:46:40.655 --> 01:46:42.337]  I think that's really part of the solution.
[01:46:42.637 --> 01:47:00.304]  And that's why they want to divide and conquer us on all these football issues about, oh, you should be able to pick what bathroom you want to go in, and men should be able to play on women's sports teams, and all these fake rights, which are a distraction from, can I not feed my kids growth hormone?
[01:47:00.344 --> 01:47:01.144]  I don't want to give it to them.
[01:47:01.604 --> 01:47:04.946]  You know, and have my girls seven feet tall when I'm 5'10".
[01:47:05.487 --> 01:47:08.889]  Can I not eat GMO in my cereal?
[01:47:08.909 --> 01:47:11.151]  Can I have healthy vitamins?
[01:47:12.411 --> 01:47:14.193]  They want us divided and conquered.
[01:47:14.213 --> 01:47:18.055]  I want to go to some phone calls here with Dr. Mercola to take your questions.
[01:47:18.075 --> 01:47:18.896]  They're all over the map.
[01:47:19.236 --> 01:47:20.677]  Sean in Canada is calling in.
[01:47:20.897 --> 01:47:22.498]  He has a question on aspartame.
[01:47:22.538 --> 01:47:22.899]  Go ahead.
[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:25.460]  Go ahead, Sean.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.362]  You're on the air with Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[01:47:28.015 --> 01:47:29.336]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:30.657]  Hello, Dr. McCullough.
[01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:31.477]  Thanks so much for your work.
[01:47:31.537 --> 01:47:41.164]  I wanted to ask you, I have quite a few friends and acquaintances who consider themselves, you know, learned types, educated, and I wanted to ask you your opinion.
[01:47:41.224 --> 01:47:47.048]  What, in your opinion, is the most alarming and well-proven side effect of aspartame in a diet?
[01:47:47.268 --> 01:47:48.409]  And further,
[01:47:49.139 --> 01:47:49.739]  I don't know.
[01:48:05.587 --> 01:48:20.792]  Faded into the background where these days, if you look up aspartame, the worst you seem to get in terms of critique is talk about increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and weight gain, which of course is serious, but not nearly as serious as the earlier revelations.
[01:48:20.852 --> 01:48:21.792]  So yeah, what is the best?
[01:48:21.812 --> 01:48:26.354]  Well, I mean, it killed racist monkeys in their first studies back in the 70s, but I don't mean to interrupt him.
[01:48:26.374 --> 01:48:29.055]  It's just funny in their press release in the AP,
[01:48:30.535 --> 01:48:35.497]  They say, and we're going to dispel the rumor that it makes you gain weight when it's on record.
[01:48:35.537 --> 01:48:36.238]  Dr. Mercola.
[01:48:37.258 --> 01:48:38.719]  Well, thank you for your question, Sean.
[01:48:38.739 --> 01:48:44.261]  I believe the most potent weapon we have with respect to studies is a study that was published in 2012.
[01:48:44.742 --> 01:48:56.227]  It was actually a human study that showed that there was an increase, that the use of aspartame was an increased link in leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma in men.
[01:48:56.807 --> 01:49:18.105]  So, and they actually, ABC contacted me when this study was published and they didn't understand why there was a difference in men and we knew the answer to that because there's an enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase which actually breaks down the methanol and that's more active in women than it is in men so that was responsible for the increase.
[01:49:18.939 --> 01:49:26.062]  Part of your other question was some of the other reasons.
[01:49:26.562 --> 01:49:34.606]  Well, if you look at the bulk of the evidence, most of these studies that are published, you have to look at who funds the studies.
[01:49:35.306 --> 01:49:37.427]  Almost every time you're going to find a
[01:49:38.234 --> 01:49:43.378]  A conclusion that is favorable to the aspartame industry is public.
[01:49:43.458 --> 01:49:46.080]  It is funded by the makers and the manufacturers.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:54.086]  And if you look at the ones that are objective and there's there's no industry support to it.
[01:49:54.546 --> 01:49:59.087]  You'll find over 90% of those studies are finance problems.
[01:49:59.107 --> 01:49:59.367]  Sure, sure.
[01:49:59.387 --> 01:50:08.790]  I mean, I've looked at the Searle studies before Monsanto bought them and, you know, all these other companies since it's been, it's patents gone up and it's been open for everybody.
[01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:14.931]  And I remember they took the dead monkeys out of the study and then used the living monkeys to say it was safe.
[01:50:15.272 --> 01:50:20.413]  I mean, they just play incredible games because they have their people in all the regulatory positions.
[01:50:21.226 --> 01:50:21.866]  Yeah.
[01:50:21.906 --> 01:50:25.189]  And just get back to that human study that was done to show the increased risk of cancer.
[01:50:25.549 --> 01:50:27.390]  That study was a long-term study.
[01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:35.555]  It was actually done over 22 years, and it was led by a physician who was on the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Harvard Medical School.
[01:50:35.595 --> 01:50:37.377]  So it was not an insignificant study.
[01:50:38.117 --> 01:50:39.838]  And that's, you know, that's for you.
[01:50:39.858 --> 01:50:41.359]  But what's wrong with leukemia?
[01:50:41.379 --> 01:50:42.200]  I mean, it only kills you.
[01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:46.451]  Yeah, but it does cause lots of other problems, autoimmune diseases.
[01:50:46.491 --> 01:50:49.073]  Many people have developed multiple sclerosis.
[01:50:49.533 --> 01:50:50.813]  Well, what about anecdotal?
[01:50:50.894 --> 01:50:54.455]  Everybody I know that gets off of it has a whole bunch of illnesses go away.
[01:50:54.515 --> 01:50:59.518]  I mean, it's not being able to sleep, skin problems, eye problems, irritability.
[01:50:59.838 --> 01:51:00.178]  Stay there.
[01:51:00.258 --> 01:51:03.800]  We're going to take some more calls in a final segment with Dr. Joseph Mercola.

[01:52:38.519 --> 01:52:41.081]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes.
[01:52:41.121 --> 01:52:43.543]  And without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:49.407]  Maser instruments detect all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.

[01:55:01.061 --> 01:55:07.626]  And it's a great way to reach the masses that the globalists hope never learn about all the studies about, hey, leukemia!
[01:55:08.206 --> 01:55:09.927]  Hey, go blind, hey!
[01:55:09.947 --> 01:55:13.990]  And then people go, oh my, my diet coke is not bad.
[01:55:14.451 --> 01:55:15.812]  It's so frustrating.
[01:55:15.852 --> 01:55:24.018]  So we've got to warn people and get the studies that are published at Mercola.com, linking to Harvard Studies, you name it, and give those to your friends and family.
[01:55:24.058 --> 01:55:25.659]  This is a life and death situation.
[01:55:25.699 --> 01:55:27.100]  Real fast, a few final calls.
[01:55:28.081 --> 01:55:31.964]  Let's talk to Julie in California.
[01:55:32.004 --> 01:55:33.725]  Quick comment or question for Dr. Mercola.
[01:55:34.691 --> 01:55:35.632]  Hi, Doctor.
[01:55:36.333 --> 01:55:40.537]  My dad was diagnosed back in the early 90s with macular degeneration.
[01:55:40.717 --> 01:55:46.542]  Both he and my mom were very, very big drinkers of Diet Coke.
[01:55:46.562 --> 01:55:50.966]  And in 2003, my mom was diagnosed with a very rare form of renal cancer.
[01:55:50.986 --> 01:55:56.712]  In fact, the University of Pennsylvania oncologist that she was going to didn't even know what kind of renal cancer it was.
[01:55:57.332 --> 01:55:59.234]  My father in 2003
[01:56:00.891 --> 01:56:01.672]  Thank you for your question.
[01:56:01.692 --> 01:56:02.753]  I am certain it didn't help.
[01:56:02.813 --> 01:56:04.274]  It's hard to say definitively without
[01:56:20.787 --> 01:56:26.571]  Reviewing more details, what the specifics were, but it most likely was a contributing factor, would be my guess.
[01:56:26.591 --> 01:56:37.179]  But it does bring up a good point for those who do have, I mean, your parents have passed away, unfortunately, but for those who are still alive and have these problems, there are two simple measures that you can do for these.
[01:56:37.259 --> 01:56:43.584]  For the macular degeneration, there is a supplement, a very potent antioxidant called Fastaxanthin.
[01:56:45.165 --> 01:56:47.126]  It's a derivative of algae.
[01:56:47.186 --> 01:56:55.911]  It's the most potent antioxidant we know of and there's some studies that show really clearly a benefit, a huge benefit in the treatment and prevention of macular degeneration.
[01:56:56.412 --> 01:57:03.716]  With respect to the treatment of cancer, there are some simply profoundly powerful strategies you can do with your diet.
[01:57:04.176 --> 01:57:11.361]  I've interviewed a Harvard researcher and someone from the University of Florida Medical School and both of those interviews on my site.
[01:57:11.401 --> 01:57:12.982]  It's called the Ketogenic Diet.
[01:57:13.582 --> 01:57:23.064]  Where, essentially, you limit your foods to high amounts of high-quality fats, not vegetable oils that are high in omega-3s.
[01:57:23.525 --> 01:57:24.605]  Oh yeah, that's on record.
[01:57:24.685 --> 01:57:26.325]  It just increased longevity.
[01:57:26.645 --> 01:57:27.646]  Well, I've seen it in rats.
[01:57:27.726 --> 01:57:29.106]  It doubles their lifespan and stuff.
[01:57:29.126 --> 01:57:29.626]  It's just amazing.
[01:57:29.646 --> 01:57:31.367]  It's a powerful thing, but especially if you have cancer.
[01:57:31.387 --> 01:57:36.388]  Cancer is affecting virtually one of two people on the planet, at least in the United States, rather.
[01:57:36.768 --> 01:57:39.669]  So, if you don't have it, someone you know is going to have it.
[01:57:40.589 --> 01:57:40.850]  Amazing.
[01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:42.912]  It works with any other treatment you want to use.
[01:57:43.293 --> 01:57:44.014]  Amazing.
[01:57:44.154 --> 01:57:45.796]  Let's jam in one more here.
[01:57:45.816 --> 01:57:47.939]  Boy, I tell you we gotta move quick.
[01:57:48.059 --> 01:57:49.581]  Richard in Washington, you're on the air.
[01:57:49.601 --> 01:57:50.002]  Go ahead.
[01:57:51.624 --> 01:57:51.925]  Yeah.
[01:57:52.325 --> 01:57:53.286]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:57:53.647 --> 01:57:54.768]  Yeah, quick question.
[01:57:54.788 --> 01:57:54.989]  Thank you.
[01:57:55.009 --> 01:57:55.630]  We only got about a minute.
[01:57:56.941 --> 01:58:02.666]  The doctor said we're no longer high in insulin and I no longer have diabetes.
[01:58:03.146 --> 01:58:06.228]  Do I have diabetes still for the rest of my life, doctor?
[01:58:06.869 --> 01:58:07.729]  Yes, just like me.
[01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:08.950]  I have diabetes too.
[01:58:09.070 --> 01:58:09.951]  All my relatives have.
[01:58:09.991 --> 01:58:19.118]  So the best you can hope to do is control it, which is great because the treatment for diabetes is actually the best treatment for the reversal of almost every disease that we know.
[01:58:19.198 --> 01:58:24.122]  So yeah, stay away from the sugars, eat lots of high quality fat, and that's the best way to do it.
[01:58:24.907 --> 01:58:26.688]  All right, hope that answers your questions.
[01:58:27.208 --> 01:58:28.369]  Appreciate your call, sir.
[01:58:28.409 --> 01:58:28.969]  God bless you.
[01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:31.531]  Dr. Mercola, just join us, mercola.com.

[01:58:45.598 --> 01:58:46.339]  No, no, thank you.
[01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:47.760]  Thank you for warning people.

[02:00:40.015 --> 02:00:41.236]  I'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:00:43.325 --> 02:00:52.547]  I want to talk with him about the attack on free speech and where he sees the future of the dinosaur media going versus the real true independent media that's so diverse and growing so fast.
[02:00:53.627 --> 02:01:03.390]  We're also going to look at some of the other geopolitical news with Ben as well and some of the distractionary issues that are engaged.
[02:01:03.410 --> 02:01:06.210]  But I have articles here from Infowars.com like this one.
[02:01:06.731 --> 02:01:10.391]  City ordinance would criminalize displaying toy guns in a threatening manner.
[02:01:10.531 --> 02:01:12.772]  Criminal to have kids run around with toy guns and say bang bang.
[02:01:14.457 --> 02:01:16.018]  This is so incredible.
[02:01:16.039 --> 02:01:17.960]  You know, rodeo clowns that make fun of Obama.
[02:01:18.341 --> 02:01:19.582]  Here comes the Secret Service.
[02:01:19.662 --> 02:01:21.523]  I mean, it is just a bunch of authoritarians.
[02:01:22.504 --> 02:01:30.552]  And now Nemo just walked in during the break with a New American article that says Snowden's his NSA targeting journalist, critical of government.
[02:01:30.632 --> 02:01:31.873]  Of course that's all come out.
[02:01:33.054 --> 02:01:34.996]  And now Snowden's pointing out that it was really bad.
[02:01:36.616 --> 02:01:39.397]  Who do you think the criminal establishment is going to target?
[02:01:40.177 --> 02:01:44.439]  Of course they're going to use spying data to try to stop the press from breaking stories of corruption.
[02:01:44.699 --> 02:01:47.060]  Of course they're going to use it to submit the criminal takeover.
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:49.481]  Of course they're going to use it to harass the media.
[02:01:50.862 --> 02:01:51.322]  Of course!
[02:01:51.362 --> 02:01:55.984]  Why do you think every authoritarian regime does this and why it's so bad?
[02:01:56.524 --> 02:01:58.865]  And then I see some of the idiot public we've talked to in Austin.
[02:01:59.305 --> 02:02:00.546]  Oh, it makes me feel safe.
[02:02:00.626 --> 02:02:01.766]  Oh, you feel safe, huh?
[02:02:03.507 --> 02:02:06.028]  You feel safe in every authoritarian regime, you idiot?
[02:02:09.073 --> 02:02:10.174]  The big banks get away.
[02:02:10.314 --> 02:02:11.475]  It's in the news every day now.
[02:02:12.115 --> 02:02:13.116]  Oh, documents released.
[02:02:13.136 --> 02:02:16.418]  They took trillions in homes they didn't own that were paid for totally.
[02:02:16.878 --> 02:02:18.979]  Yeah, they're like, Judge, our house is paid for.
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:20.080]  I'm sorry.
[02:02:20.921 --> 02:02:22.121]  They say they've got a deed.
[02:02:22.141 --> 02:02:23.162]  I don't even need to look at it.
[02:02:24.022 --> 02:02:26.304]  Wells Fargo, Bank of America, the house is yours.
[02:02:29.306 --> 02:02:31.727]  And if you don't like it, we got armed troops outside.
[02:02:31.747 --> 02:02:33.609]  They're called paramilitary police.
[02:02:34.502 --> 02:02:35.703]  The house is ours, lady.
[02:02:35.783 --> 02:02:37.543]  And your pension funds are theirs, too, cops.
[02:02:38.144 --> 02:02:41.525]  They've already started taking all the police's pension funds.
[02:02:41.825 --> 02:02:43.086]  But a lot of you cops don't care.
[02:02:43.106 --> 02:02:47.047]  As long as you can shove around some little people, that's what you're really looking for in life.
[02:02:47.988 --> 02:02:49.989]  Drink some Diet Coke, take some vaccines.
[02:02:50.009 --> 02:02:51.129]  The government loves you.
[02:02:51.169 --> 02:02:52.330]  Live forever, sweetie.
[02:02:52.890 --> 02:02:54.350]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[02:02:54.370 --> 02:02:55.811]  Sorry you didn't have time to talk to Mercola.
[02:02:56.131 --> 02:03:00.052]  He had to go, but what's your point about bio-photons?
[02:03:00.072 --> 02:03:05.474]  Would that be like jellyfish that glow in the dark, or glow worms, or lightning bugs?
[02:03:05.514 --> 02:03:06.094]  What's going on?
[02:03:06.934 --> 02:03:13.116]  I'm sure it's Mercola's fault, because he's written a lot of articles on bio-photons, and perhaps I should save that point for later.
[02:03:14.337 --> 02:03:16.217]  No, no, I want to hear about bio-photons.
[02:03:16.237 --> 02:03:18.838]  Sorry I didn't get to you, but tell me about bio-photons.
[02:03:19.491 --> 02:03:22.632]  I wanted to know if Dr. McCullough agreed with Dr. Gabriel Cousins.
[02:03:23.333 --> 02:03:28.395]  When I interviewed Dr. Cousins about ten years ago, he wrote an article on economic globalism.
[02:03:29.355 --> 02:03:34.158]  And Dr. Cousins also studies the research of Dr. Fritz Hoppe-Hoppe, just like Dr. McCullough.
[02:03:34.798 --> 02:03:42.141]  And I asked Dr. Cousins if he thought that if everyone had an adequate biophoton level that we could defeat the globalists, and he said yes, he did.
[02:03:44.722 --> 02:03:52.827]  The quote that I wanted to share before you comment on my comment is a quote by Lenin, which I think you're going to love.
[02:03:53.387 --> 02:03:58.610]  He said, Socialized medicine is the keystone to the arc of the socialist state.
[02:03:59.991 --> 02:04:03.393]  And basically what that means is that everything in our society of any significance
[02:04:04.139 --> 02:04:07.760]  Okay, well explain to me about bio-photons, the electrochemical interactions in the human body.
[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:09.261]  Specifically, give me some details.
[02:04:24.361 --> 02:04:25.522]  It's our spidey sense.
[02:04:25.662 --> 02:04:30.367]  Bio-photons is the solid energy that all living systems store in the nucleus of their cells.
[02:04:30.907 --> 02:04:35.211]  And then every cell uses that coherent solid energy to communicate to everything else.
[02:04:36.072 --> 02:04:37.113]  It's our spidey sense.
[02:04:37.693 --> 02:04:41.077]  And we're destroying our spidey sense by doing certain things.
[02:04:41.097 --> 02:04:41.677]  Well, I know this.
[02:04:41.777 --> 02:04:44.680]  Everything the globalists are doing is to suppress the human mind.
[02:04:45.621 --> 02:04:48.403]  And the emission of bio-photons is technically a type of
[02:04:50.436 --> 02:05:01.131]  Bioluminescence, but the later term is generally reserved for higher luminescence, but I guess you're saying that we have this, uh, going on at another level, but, uh, or quantifying the sixth sense.
[02:05:01.632 --> 02:05:01.933]  I don't know.
[02:05:01.953 --> 02:05:03.415]  I should have brought up biophotons, Jim.
[02:05:03.435 --> 02:05:05.678]  I wouldn't want to hear a medical doctor's take on that.
[02:05:05.718 --> 02:05:06.139]  Stay with us.
[02:05:09.989 --> 02:05:17.292]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[02:05:17.732 --> 02:05:21.533]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[02:06:13.397 --> 02:06:18.680]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:26.465]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:06:26.645 --> 02:06:35.751]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:06:35.951 --> 02:06:42.961]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:06:43.122 --> 02:06:46.026]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:06:46.186 --> 02:06:51.954]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[02:06:52.815 --> 02:06:53.496]  A war.
[02:06:53.556 --> 02:06:54.417]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:06:54.477 --> 02:06:55.779]  Another plane just hit!
[02:06:55.819 --> 02:06:56.640]  State of Mind.
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:06:58.301]  Because there's a war on.

[02:08:26.357 --> 02:08:30.976]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:40.762 --> 02:08:42.184]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[02:08:42.985 --> 02:08:50.595]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are now rampaging on fire with liberty into hour number three.
[02:08:51.676 --> 02:08:53.118]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:08:53.178 --> 02:08:57.323]  We're broadcasting on over 160 AM and FM stations across the United States.
[02:08:57.824 --> 02:08:58.244]  We're good to go.
[02:09:25.185 --> 02:09:28.486]  Where to start, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to Ben Swan here in just a moment.
[02:09:29.306 --> 02:09:39.628]  They're saying 100 plus dead, 500 plus dead, 120 dead, different numbers coming out from the Associated Press, the World Tribune, you name it.
[02:09:40.488 --> 02:09:44.929]  Massacre in Cairo as Egypt declares state of emergency.
[02:09:45.409 --> 02:09:53.110]  Egyptian security forces today moved to oust pro-Morosi supporters from two sit-in protests announcing the former president's removal from power.
[02:09:53.530 --> 02:10:00.332]  Leaving scores dead and hundreds injured in Cairo, the Egyptian president has announced a month-long state of emergency.
[02:10:03.213 --> 02:10:18.579]  Well, folks, since 1933, we've been under a state of emergency that's been a little bit softer, that they've used to erode the Bill of Rights and Constitution, the War Powers Act, signed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt after a few years of the Great Depression, the great foreign banking takeover.
[02:10:20.259 --> 02:10:26.320]  But more and more, that's how they say the NSA spies on us in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:27.980]  Oh, well, it's an emergency.
[02:10:28.141 --> 02:10:30.421]  Or spy on the press and persecute the press.
[02:10:30.441 --> 02:10:31.401]  Well, it's an emergency.
[02:10:32.221 --> 02:10:34.222]  And now it's coming out in the news.
[02:10:34.302 --> 02:10:36.322]  Snowden is saying what's already known.
[02:10:36.342 --> 02:10:37.902]  That fish swim in the sea.
[02:10:37.922 --> 02:10:40.823]  That the sun comes up in the morning in the east and sets in the west.
[02:10:40.863 --> 02:10:43.303]  That the ether bunny isn't real.
[02:10:44.964 --> 02:10:45.644]  Oh my goodness.
[02:10:46.864 --> 02:10:53.707]  This has already been confirmed before Snowden even came out, that they're targeting the press and people critical of government policies with the NSA.
[02:10:54.368 --> 02:10:55.708]  Who would have thought that?
[02:10:55.909 --> 02:10:57.329]  That's authoritarianism!
[02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:58.690]  That's tyranny!
[02:10:58.730 --> 02:10:59.831]  That's terrible!
[02:10:59.851 --> 02:11:04.373]  You mean they're going to illegally spy and then use it to keep corrupt systems in power?
[02:11:04.393 --> 02:11:04.433]  No!
[02:11:06.934 --> 02:11:12.883]  You mean they're going to use that data for globalist corporations that control the government to shut down their competition?
[02:11:13.444 --> 02:11:14.465]  No!
[02:11:15.026 --> 02:11:21.476]  You mean the mainstream media is going to use it to be able to get key intel and spin the news and shut down alternative media?
[02:11:21.636 --> 02:11:22.217]  No!
[02:11:24.278 --> 02:11:32.290]  Every government that acts like this one, it ends in just millions dead, black uniforms, surveillance, people being disappeared in the middle of the night.
[02:11:32.650 --> 02:11:33.672]  We know where this goes.
[02:11:33.732 --> 02:11:36.215]  We know how this movie ends, how the book ends.
[02:11:36.235 --> 02:11:37.197]  It's not a good thing.
[02:11:39.264 --> 02:11:44.788]  They say each generation has to go through its own crisis, but then they have these generations, three or four, that go through hell.
[02:11:45.368 --> 02:11:52.713]  And folks, we're lined up for that right now, and I suggest that we get off the bus, get off the train, they can drop us off right here.
[02:11:53.514 --> 02:11:59.338]  Drop us off back in America, not in the middle of an Orwellian technocracy that's out of control.
[02:12:01.203 --> 02:12:07.088]  And they're just bombarding us, and there's all these studies, Harvard studies about, yes, aspartame gives you leukemia.
[02:12:07.688 --> 02:12:10.030]  Aspartame makes you go blind with macular degeneration.
[02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:12.091]  Aspartame killed the monkeys in the test.
[02:12:12.432 --> 02:12:13.613]  Aspartame's highly addictive.
[02:12:13.793 --> 02:12:16.875]  And then Coke's coming out going, it doesn't make you fat, doesn't matter, there's all the studies.
[02:12:17.476 --> 02:12:19.477]  Oh, it doesn't matter, it's safe, we say so.
[02:12:20.038 --> 02:12:29.265]  Just like every year before the school starts, they come out and say, ladies and gentlemen, it is the law to take shots, and there's no side effects.
[02:12:30.455 --> 02:12:42.263]  I mean, I read those news articles every year going, don't listen to the kooks that say it can make you go blind, or get narcolepsy, or have convulsions, or there are no side effects other than it hurting your arm when the needle goes in.
[02:12:42.303 --> 02:12:42.944]  That's a quote.
[02:12:43.824 --> 02:12:45.005]  Was it the Fort Worth Star-Telegram?
[02:12:45.045 --> 02:12:45.946]  I think, yeah, it ran with that.
[02:12:46.566 --> 02:12:52.771]  I mean, I could just, I mean, I read that on air last year like ten times, because it was like, there is, you just read the insert, it says, might kill you!
[02:12:53.973 --> 02:12:55.033]  Might make you go blind!
[02:12:55.073 --> 02:12:57.575]  Might make you have an autoimmune disorder!
[02:12:57.635 --> 02:13:03.477]  You can go to the CDC and read on every vaccine the hundreds of things it can do to you.
[02:13:04.558 --> 02:13:06.058]  Hey, what's wrong about dying?
[02:13:06.098 --> 02:13:07.279]  What's wrong about getting cancer?
[02:13:07.799 --> 02:13:09.680]  Their answer is, hey, kook, shut up, weirdo!
[02:13:11.294 --> 02:13:13.035]  There's no problem with vaccines.
[02:13:13.315 --> 02:13:15.697]  Why are they discredited?
[02:13:15.737 --> 02:13:18.379]  The medical doctor from England that exposed it.
[02:13:18.419 --> 02:13:20.620]  Then you go read and none of that was even true.
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:21.441]  It was all a big hoax.
[02:13:21.961 --> 02:13:22.081]  Why?
[02:13:22.101 --> 02:13:26.764]  They might come out tomorrow and go, we've discredited that the sun, it controls climate on the earth.
[02:13:26.784 --> 02:13:27.345]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:13:27.365 --> 02:13:31.547]  The UN four years ago had a vote to say the sun doesn't affect climate.
[02:13:32.128 --> 02:13:32.828]  I forgot.
[02:13:32.868 --> 02:13:34.309]  They already did that.
[02:13:34.749 --> 02:13:37.912]  I mean, maybe they can have a vote and suspend gravity.
[02:13:38.712 --> 02:13:43.937]  Here on Terra Firma, this is the type of total assault on reality that's going on.
[02:13:45.118 --> 02:13:47.980]  And many people are just going, I know it's corrupt, there's nothing we can do.
[02:13:49.401 --> 02:13:52.784]  But still others are saying, oh no, it's not that bad, it's for our own good.
[02:13:53.045 --> 02:13:55.186]  But many others are punching out of the system.
[02:13:56.868 --> 02:14:02.092]  And as the old kleptocratic, dinosaur, prostitute, parrot media,
[02:14:03.035 --> 02:14:11.738]  The parrot press, as they, in every metric you've seen the news, is almost in a lower approval rating than Congress with a 10%.
[02:14:12.078 --> 02:14:13.219]  I mean, they're burning down.
[02:14:13.459 --> 02:14:21.321]  And their answer is, we'll have state-run CIA, Pentagon, direct PSYOPs in your town, paying off local bloggers or shutting them down.
[02:14:22.042 --> 02:14:22.862]  That's all being announced.
[02:14:22.902 --> 02:14:25.403]  So, get this through your head, folks, if you're a new listener.
[02:14:25.863 --> 02:14:26.963]  It's been announced.
[02:14:29.184 --> 02:14:31.665]  It's been announced that they're coming after everybody.
[02:14:32.503 --> 02:14:33.443]  Now, that doesn't scare me.
[02:14:33.483 --> 02:14:36.344]  That means they're having to take the gloves off, come right out in the open.
[02:14:37.405 --> 02:14:49.129]  And if the New World Order couldn't hold Afghanistan to get the opium out against, you know, a few hundred thousand fighters over there, if we just physically speak out against it, physically, non-violently, put our weight against it, it's over for this system.
[02:14:50.089 --> 02:14:54.431]  And the best we can hope for is like the USSR, that the New World Order that runs America collapses.
[02:14:55.253 --> 02:15:02.194]  And they plan on collapsing us anyway into Agenda 21, and then using that collapse as a way to re-engineer society with them posing as the savior.
[02:15:02.254 --> 02:15:03.655]  No, they need to collapse!
[02:15:04.815 --> 02:15:08.536]  We need to reinstate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and we need to start arresting.
[02:15:09.476 --> 02:15:14.137]  One way or another, just put that idea out, because it will then manifest politically if people get it.
[02:15:14.177 --> 02:15:15.177]  No, no, this is criminal.
[02:15:16.897 --> 02:15:18.138]  They admit fake terror alerts.
[02:15:18.178 --> 02:15:19.198]  Now, we told you that last week.
[02:15:19.238 --> 02:15:20.158]  Now they're admitted to be fake.
[02:15:21.388 --> 02:15:22.548]  Everything we've told you coming true.
[02:15:22.748 --> 02:15:25.349]  You know, I mention this all the time that we're going to our guests for the balance of the hour.
[02:15:26.370 --> 02:15:31.211]  About, I see articles all the time where thousands of foster kids are missing in Florida.
[02:15:31.691 --> 02:15:35.432]  Many of the small children, they end up in Saudi Arabia and Thailand and stuff.
[02:15:35.853 --> 02:15:38.673]  Flown out by the big aircraft owned by the banks.
[02:15:38.733 --> 02:15:40.054]  The same ones that ship the drugs around.
[02:15:40.894 --> 02:15:41.855]  And I saw this again today.
[02:15:42.196 --> 02:15:46.901]  Missing 78 children from Oklahoma Department of Human Services custody.
[02:15:47.001 --> 02:15:53.248]  I mean, they're seven times more likely, just department numbers, to abuse kids in their custody than anybody else that is government.
[02:15:53.508 --> 02:15:56.211]  But we need to take kids for no reason and give them to them.
[02:15:57.153 --> 02:15:57.693]  It's amazing.
[02:15:57.934 --> 02:15:59.915]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on.
[02:16:00.255 --> 02:16:01.836]  The types of things that are happening.
[02:16:02.157 --> 02:16:06.179]  The incredible Orwellian attack on free speech.
[02:16:06.219 --> 02:16:07.861]  We have an article on Infowars.com.
[02:16:08.641 --> 02:16:12.444]  19 shocking examples of how political correctness is destroying America.
[02:16:13.044 --> 02:16:15.086]  But now we go to a real journalist.
[02:16:16.576 --> 02:16:19.961]  Swan has won both the Edward R. Murrow Award and the Lone Star Emmy Awards.
[02:16:20.402 --> 02:16:23.086]  He has specialized in covering the 2012 GOP presidential primaries.
[02:16:23.366 --> 02:16:27.973]  He's gotten a lot of hard questions in to Obama and others that became international news stories.
[02:16:28.013 --> 02:16:32.540]  He's a graduate of Brigham Young University with a Master's in Humanities from California State University.
[02:16:33.925 --> 02:16:37.106]  And he's had the hit show, Reality Check, there with Fox.
[02:16:38.187 --> 02:16:42.029]  And then, of course, he got out of that on his own accord, because they wanted to control what he was saying and doing.
[02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:43.629]  BenSwan.com.
[02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:46.911]  You can find all of that stuff at Twitter, too, at Ben Swan.
[02:16:47.851 --> 02:16:50.232]  And more, or Facebook, Ben Swan Reality Check.
[02:16:50.693 --> 02:16:55.595]  And he joins us here today to talk about his own media operation he's launching.
[02:16:55.615 --> 02:16:59.157]  And people ask, man, what are you doing having other media people on that will directly compete with you?
[02:16:59.517 --> 02:16:59.737]  No, no.
[02:17:00.157 --> 02:17:01.938]  I'm competing with The Globalist.
[02:17:02.598 --> 02:17:04.859]  I'm competing with the people shutting down our power plants.
[02:17:05.279 --> 02:17:07.660]  I'm competing with the people trying to put deadly vaccines in kids.
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:13.782]  I'm competing with the mega banks getting $85 billion a month of our money to destroy our economy.
[02:17:14.742 --> 02:17:18.203]  I'm competing with the collectivists and the crony capitalists that control them.
[02:17:18.703 --> 02:17:18.843]  Yes.
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:40.727]  Thank God we need more real alternative grassroots media that does it professionally, not less.
[02:17:40.987 --> 02:17:42.348]  Ben Swammer, we're going to break in a minute.
[02:17:42.609 --> 02:17:44.971]  Thank you for coming on with us, but there's so much to talk about.
[02:17:45.271 --> 02:17:53.940]  Front and center, what do you make of the state of the media wars and our whole society and how everything you and I have talked about is now almost becoming passe?
[02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:57.183]  It's just like the floodgates have opened on all the corruption.
[02:17:57.623 --> 02:18:01.746]  Well, I think that you have to take a lot of credit for how much of that corruption is coming to the surface.
[02:18:01.786 --> 02:18:10.152]  Look, at the end of the day, alternative media, you're naming these names right now, but alternative media is the driving force in exposing all of this, and Alex, you're at the front of that.
[02:18:10.853 --> 02:18:17.158]  Certainly, you have to look at InfoWars and say, look at the impact that InfoWars has had on the mainstream news cycle.
[02:18:17.178 --> 02:18:18.539]  I mean, you guys have forced
[02:18:19.019 --> 02:18:22.262]  The mainstream to talk about issues that they were never going to talk about.
[02:18:22.722 --> 02:18:25.625]  A good example of that is the ammo stockpiling by DHS.
[02:18:26.145 --> 02:18:27.867]  That was a story that was never going to break.
[02:18:27.907 --> 02:18:30.409]  You guys broke it a year before it was ever mainstream.
[02:18:31.390 --> 02:18:33.111]  And continued to hammer on it and hammer on it.
[02:18:33.171 --> 02:18:36.214]  And finally it comes out, you know, that oh yeah, well in fact this is happening.
[02:18:36.254 --> 02:18:37.815]  And Fox starts talking about it.
[02:18:37.835 --> 02:18:39.116]  CBS starts talking about it.
[02:18:39.617 --> 02:18:40.798]  And then it kind of grows from there.
[02:18:41.078 --> 02:18:50.486]  So I think what we've seen is a paradigm shift now where alternative media is actually driving the investigative reporting and driving the conversation and mainstream is just trying to catch up.
[02:18:51.347 --> 02:18:55.371]  And by the way, we're not blowing smoke here or on power trips.
[02:18:55.391 --> 02:19:00.075]  It's actually a great responsibility for all the alternative real media, the new media, the independent media.
[02:19:01.384 --> 02:19:04.385]  Everything we cover, two or three days later, is mainstream news.
[02:19:04.705 --> 02:19:07.226]  And a lot of times, they're even forced to go with our quote, angle.
[02:19:07.526 --> 02:19:08.966]  We just try to go with the truth.
[02:19:09.426 --> 02:19:13.647]  And thanks to DrugsReport.com, like the nitrous oxide has really helped launch us.
[02:19:13.687 --> 02:19:15.928]  We do not have enough thanks to them.
[02:19:15.948 --> 02:19:17.068]  But I've talked to their folks.
[02:19:17.088 --> 02:19:18.849]  They're like, well, you cover really important news.
[02:19:18.909 --> 02:19:20.109]  It's real stuff, so we carry it.
[02:19:20.349 --> 02:19:23.390]  We just carry whatever we think is really important and people need to know.
[02:19:23.410 --> 02:19:27.791]  And I think the self-preservation instinct, Ben, is starting to kick in.
[02:19:28.031 --> 02:19:30.272]  That's why you're seeing such a rebellion against tyranny.
[02:19:30.832 --> 02:19:35.620]  Oh, I agree, and I think for the most part, a lot of the mainstream apparatus doesn't understand what you're doing.
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:37.262]  They don't understand InfoWars.
[02:19:37.282 --> 02:19:38.644]  They don't understand the stories you cover.
[02:19:38.985 --> 02:19:40.407]  And so it's such a foreign concept.
[02:19:40.447 --> 02:19:41.789]  It's like, well, what is he talking about?
[02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:45.275]  And then it's like, but we've got to talk about it because people are listening.
[02:19:46.821 --> 02:19:47.342]  Absolutely.
[02:19:47.382 --> 02:19:52.567]  Now I'm going to try to shut up when we come back and just go through whatever you think is most important in the news for a segment.
[02:19:52.687 --> 02:20:01.716]  Then, Ben, I want to get into a bunch of stories out there and get your take on them and also talk about the new media operation you're launching and how folks can get behind that.
[02:20:02.117 --> 02:20:05.620]  Because if we don't all hang together, we will certainly hang separate.
[02:20:06.021 --> 02:20:06.601]  Who said that?
[02:20:06.702 --> 02:20:08.403]  One of our terrorist founding fathers.
[02:20:09.454 --> 02:20:20.476]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.

[02:21:09.755 --> 02:21:16.724]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[02:21:17.285 --> 02:21:20.349]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:26.797]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[02:21:27.657 --> 02:21:38.205]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[02:21:38.885 --> 02:21:43.048]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[02:21:43.789 --> 02:21:51.937]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[02:21:52.457 --> 02:21:55.880]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[02:21:56.301 --> 02:21:58.282]  It's something much darker.
[02:21:58.743 --> 02:22:04.048]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[02:22:04.448 --> 02:22:05.789]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[02:22:08.672 --> 02:22:09.593]  Thank you, listeners.

[02:22:38.075 --> 02:22:47.318]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:47.378 --> 02:22:48.098]  This capitalism?
[02:22:48.158 --> 02:22:54.280]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:57.962]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:23:07.925 --> 02:23:11.928]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:23:12.589 --> 02:23:14.730]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:15.611 --> 02:23:23.957]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:24.597 --> 02:23:29.501]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:24:04.344 --> 02:24:05.325]  Protect your immune system.
[02:24:05.605 --> 02:24:06.646]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:13.803 --> 02:24:16.405]  We're here six days a week on the radio, 11 a.m.
[02:24:16.425 --> 02:24:16.945]  to 2 p.m.
[02:24:16.985 --> 02:24:19.067]  weekdays, Sundays 4 to 6 central.
[02:24:19.848 --> 02:24:20.868]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:24:21.109 --> 02:24:22.910]  Look at this story up on Infowars.com.
[02:24:22.950 --> 02:24:24.011]  Julie Wilson wrote about it.
[02:24:25.072 --> 02:24:26.473]  It is an actual news story right now.
[02:24:26.533 --> 02:24:31.897]  Teenager denied heart transplant over history of non-compliance added to wait list.
[02:24:32.077 --> 02:24:36.721]  Low grades in school and brushes with the law initially kept teenager off heart transplant list.
[02:24:37.081 --> 02:24:43.066]  Don't you love it when the bioethicists decide, you know, what you've done in your life, so what you get.
[02:24:43.726 --> 02:24:46.268]  I mean, they want to run our lives, bottom line, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:46.568 --> 02:24:56.095]  Going back to reporter Ben Swan, who left his very popular Fox gig because he wanted, I guess it's been undisclosed, but wanted to not be controlled.
[02:24:56.115 --> 02:25:01.139]  I think you said it was they wanted you to cover local stuff and not national, even though national is local.
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:04.121]  But now you're doing your own media thing.
[02:25:04.141 --> 02:25:05.342]  We're gonna get to that in the next segment.
[02:25:05.642 --> 02:25:07.864]  But out of all the stuff going on out there,
[02:25:08.604 --> 02:25:10.828]  What do you think is most important in the news right now?
[02:25:10.888 --> 02:25:11.629]  The NSA?
[02:25:11.689 --> 02:25:13.271]  The persecution of the press?
[02:25:13.993 --> 02:25:14.794]  With the IRS?
[02:25:14.834 --> 02:25:16.977]  I mean, how much is it going to take until this changes?
[02:25:17.518 --> 02:25:18.980]  What else is front and center for you?
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:21.203]  Or, I'm just guessing, is it those topics?
[02:25:21.772 --> 02:25:23.754]  Well, I think those topics are important.
[02:25:23.794 --> 02:25:26.917]  I think they all kind of have the same root issue to them.
[02:25:26.957 --> 02:25:40.150]  So when we talk about the NSA, when we talk about the IRS and what's going on there, the fact that, you know, we just reported this past week that with the IRS, the woman in charge of all of these agents who were targeting conservative groups was promoted.
[02:25:41.250 --> 02:25:44.332]  And again, you know, we work to break down that left-right paradigm.
[02:25:44.352 --> 02:25:49.174]  You've got Republican members of Congress who are not holding that particular person accountable.
[02:25:49.214 --> 02:25:51.896]  She was the person overseeing the entire office in Cincinnati.
[02:25:52.236 --> 02:25:53.256]  She's not been held accountable.
[02:25:53.517 --> 02:25:55.598]  You have on the left, they're not holding anyone accountable.
[02:25:55.638 --> 02:26:00.120]  And so, it's all political games and no one's actually working to resolve any of these issues.
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:02.663]  The NSA thing is obviously very important.
[02:26:02.783 --> 02:26:15.459]  I think what we're seeing out of that, though, that is especially important is the fact that right now, despite all the claims about Edward Snowden being a traitor to the country and the claims that are made that he somehow betrayed the nation,
[02:26:15.839 --> 02:26:21.000]  We are now seeing the effect of what he did by revealing this information to the American public.
[02:26:21.381 --> 02:26:25.682]  The change in terms of the public demanding that action be taken.
[02:26:25.762 --> 02:26:28.963]  Hopefully, the American public won't back down or slow down on that.
[02:26:29.063 --> 02:26:34.084]  And again, I think you've got to credit alternative media with pushing that narrative forward.
[02:26:34.144 --> 02:26:40.146]  Because mainstream media didn't want to talk about this other than to talk about the Snowden issue himself and how bad he was.
[02:26:40.826 --> 02:26:55.410]  Uh, and to question him personally and his motivations, it's alternative media that has really been at the forefront of saying, wait a minute, Snowden may be, uh, in your opinion, a traitor, but the fact is he's a whistleblower under law and this is what the NSA is doing.
[02:26:55.470 --> 02:26:56.671]  That's all alternative media.
[02:26:56.711 --> 02:26:57.991]  That did not come from the networks.
[02:27:00.444 --> 02:27:03.449]  Let me go back to that question that you didn't get a chance to answer and went to break.
[02:27:03.529 --> 02:27:07.795]  How do you see it playing out right now as the establishment implodes?
[02:27:07.835 --> 02:27:09.417]  Their answer is just a power grab.
[02:27:10.659 --> 02:27:13.924]  What does your gut tell you it's going to be like, say, in five years?
[02:27:15.083 --> 02:27:23.968]  Well, a lot of that, I think, depends on how Americans respond to the claims that are going to be made over internet piracy bills and intellectual property bills.
[02:27:24.588 --> 02:27:34.433]  And so if we get bills like CISPA being pushed through and SOPA and PIPA, the design behind those bills, as your listeners know, it has nothing to do with intellectual property at all.
[02:27:34.533 --> 02:27:39.956]  It has everything to do with eliminating competition, because major corporate media
[02:27:40.416 --> 02:27:49.882]  I want to be able to say, well look, if we can accuse bloggers and writers and smaller news entities of copyright infringement, we can shut down their sites.
[02:27:49.922 --> 02:27:50.643]  And that's the goal.
[02:27:50.683 --> 02:27:52.564]  The goal is to say, we've got to eliminate competition.
[02:27:52.584 --> 02:27:53.604]  They already do that!
[02:27:54.105 --> 02:27:59.608]  I've had them declare they own my voice, which is made up, until I threaten to sue people and delete hundreds of videos.
[02:27:59.848 --> 02:28:03.471]  I mean, they're doing, and they do this to little people especially, because they can't fight back.
[02:28:04.011 --> 02:28:04.351]  That's right.
[02:28:04.551 --> 02:28:09.736]  We're releasing a piece for our first full disclosure that we've put out since we started this project.
[02:28:09.996 --> 02:28:11.337]  It'll be released next Monday.
[02:28:12.078 --> 02:28:23.987]  But the piece is about the fact that the NSA, in fact, is using copyright law, or claims I should say, copyright claims, to actually shut down t-shirt makers who are making fun of the NSA.
[02:28:24.007 --> 02:28:27.310]  And they're squashing that freedom of speech, claiming copyright.
[02:28:27.370 --> 02:28:28.211]  Wow!
[02:28:28.231 --> 02:28:29.592]  So this hasn't broke yet?
[02:28:29.632 --> 02:28:30.553]  That's amazing!
[02:28:31.053 --> 02:28:31.594]  No, it hasn't.
[02:28:31.734 --> 02:28:32.995]  We'll be the first ones to break it.
[02:28:33.276 --> 02:28:35.218]  We're putting this out for people to hear, and it is.
[02:28:35.278 --> 02:28:36.399]  It's an amazing story.
[02:28:36.660 --> 02:28:46.031]  When you get into what the NSA is claiming, and this is why it's so important, Alex, as you know, it's not an issue of whether or not law is on the side of those making these claims.
[02:28:46.451 --> 02:28:50.736]  They simply make the claims and then use muscle to force their way to control the NSA.
[02:28:51.257 --> 02:29:09.468]  They claim you're a murderer, so you go to jail, no trial, and they've said at the UN and at Davos, as you've said here, I think some of the audience may not understand this, so we should probably spell it out, they're going to use fake claims to shut down all the free web, and here's the NSA and cyber security with what you're saying, already trying it.
[02:29:09.969 --> 02:29:16.733]  In fact, I've heard Homeland Security threaten people, and they tried to get a law passed two years ago, where you can't even show their symbol in a parody.
[02:29:17.293 --> 02:29:19.174]  So they are attacking our speech.
[02:29:19.854 --> 02:29:24.076]  And that, by the way, the parody issue is one that's very clear under law.
[02:29:24.656 --> 02:29:27.678]  Parodies are a form of fair use.
[02:29:28.018 --> 02:29:32.780]  And yet, the NSA, DHS, they don't have to be able to go to court and fight for this.
[02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:33.520]  And that's the issue.
[02:29:34.220 --> 02:29:39.163]  If they're really going to fight this, it goes to a court, and that's where the legal fight takes place.
[02:29:39.203 --> 02:29:40.083]  And that's not what they're doing.
[02:29:40.263 --> 02:29:40.683]  No, no, no.
[02:29:40.703 --> 02:29:44.105]  They want laws where they can just make a claim and your site's gone forever.
[02:29:45.326 --> 02:29:50.071]  Well, look, I've got articles here where they're saying arrest the guy for the rodeo mask of Obama.
[02:29:50.111 --> 02:29:52.874]  I mean, folks, these people are coming for our liberty.
[02:29:52.894 --> 02:29:54.255]  They're persecuting the press.
[02:29:54.335 --> 02:29:54.816]  Stay there.
[02:29:54.856 --> 02:29:57.719]  Ben Schwamm, we're going to talk about how to turn the tide on the other side.
[02:29:58.740 --> 02:29:59.621]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.121 --> 02:30:01.723]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.664 --> 02:30:05.346]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:19.276 --> 02:31:25.659]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:31:26.059 --> 02:31:28.020]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:31:28.361 --> 02:31:29.401]  They're the good guys.

[02:32:09.249 --> 02:32:13.831]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:32:13.971 --> 02:32:16.933]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:32:17.093 --> 02:32:22.335]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:32:22.655 --> 02:32:24.316]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:32:24.596 --> 02:32:25.857]  We are what we eat.
[02:32:26.357 --> 02:32:30.560]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:34.883]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:32:35.123 --> 02:32:37.425]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:32:37.665 --> 02:32:43.590]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:46.852 --> 02:32:50.093]  You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential
[02:33:18.549 --> 02:33:22.112]  Uh, no.
[02:33:22.132 --> 02:33:23.153]  Program run amok.
[02:33:24.034 --> 02:33:28.117]  But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.
[02:33:28.758 --> 02:33:43.730]  And if people can't trust not only the executive branch, but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution, due process, and rule of law, then we're going to have some problems here.
[02:33:44.966 --> 02:33:46.728]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:47.108 --> 02:33:50.072]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:51.393 --> 02:33:54.176]  And if you have a business, you didn't build that.
[02:33:55.478 --> 02:33:56.599]  Oh, and don't forget the other one.
[02:33:56.619 --> 02:33:59.182]  Don't listen to the voices that say watch out for tyranny.
[02:33:59.202 --> 02:34:02.445]  You know, that tyranny could be lurking.
[02:34:03.066 --> 02:34:04.808]  No, that's just history in total fact.
[02:34:07.409 --> 02:34:10.231]  The fact that we're, like, plunging into tyranny right now.
[02:34:10.251 --> 02:34:12.033]  I mean, no one denies that.
[02:34:12.073 --> 02:34:15.856]  No political science professor, left-right sinner, libertarian communist.
[02:34:15.916 --> 02:34:16.616]  No one denies it.
[02:34:17.097 --> 02:34:21.120]  No one denies they're butchering the Bill of Rights up one side, down the other, and saying it's for our own good.
[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:23.322]  It's like a coming-out party for tyrants.
[02:34:23.342 --> 02:34:25.724]  We're going to go back to Ben Swan here in a moment.
[02:34:25.744 --> 02:34:27.085]  We've got a bunch of callers holding.
[02:34:27.105 --> 02:34:29.607]  Might as well throw them into the mix here today.
[02:34:29.627 --> 02:34:33.010]  A couple of the sponsors that make the broadcast possible that I endorse
[02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:41.757]  eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex with hurricane season coming up and all the economic things that are going on and all the uncertainty.
[02:34:41.977 --> 02:34:46.922]  I have scorable foods and I went through a lot of trial and error and then found eFoodsDirect like seven years ago.
[02:34:46.942 --> 02:34:48.203]  They've been my sponsor ever since.
[02:34:48.463 --> 02:34:49.864]  They're the biggest company out there.
[02:34:50.965 --> 02:34:53.407]  They don't sell to Homeland Security, by the way, although they've been trying to buy from them.
[02:34:53.427 --> 02:34:54.508]  I'm going to get them on about that.
[02:34:54.528 --> 02:34:58.451]  The globalists can get their own stuff somewhere else.
[02:34:59.492 --> 02:35:03.335]  And they're patriots just like you and I. eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:35:03.355 --> 02:35:05.096]  They've got a bunch of specials running right now.

[02:35:18.965 --> 02:35:28.433]  And lastly, listen, none of us are perfect.
[02:35:28.473 --> 02:35:32.757]  I fought the globalists for a decade and didn't even care about my health and gained like 60 pounds.
[02:35:32.797 --> 02:35:37.982]  I've lost 30-something of it and it's a battle every day working up here so many long hours and trying to be healthy.
[02:35:38.002 --> 02:35:42.586]  But I couldn't do it without all the products that are at Infowarshealth.com.
[02:35:43.607 --> 02:35:45.291]  With the biggest discounts out there.
[02:35:45.311 --> 02:35:47.054]  People can claim they've got bigger discounts and stuff.
[02:35:47.094 --> 02:35:47.595]  It's not true.
[02:35:47.936 --> 02:35:51.222]  We have the best discounts available at Infowarshealth.com
[02:35:53.380 --> 02:36:20.923]  on the great healthy energy drink polymers plus and i'm on the packaging of it so much i like it i said i want to endorse this beyond taking tangerine two point oh nine g m o uh... uh... organic got all the government certifications that's all the site uh... in force health dot com all the great osteo effects stuff for your joints hundreds and hundreds of amazing products in force health dot com and there's also a toll-free number there on the side of you want to call uh... and ask uh... any

[02:36:50.408 --> 02:36:54.694]  I want to thank all of you that have been supporting us there and voting with your dollars so that we can be.
[02:36:55.663 --> 02:37:06.866]  Kind of a beachhead for other media and other activists and other groups and people to come on the show every day to make you aware of other folks that are out there fighting tyranny.
[02:37:06.926 --> 02:37:08.806]  Not like he needs a lot of help from us.
[02:37:08.846 --> 02:37:16.468]  Ben Swan, again, incredibly popular TV show that was becoming a national phenomenon when the local Fox affiliate said, no more.
[02:37:16.488 --> 02:37:22.830]  And that's how they came to me when I had the number one show in Austin on FM in that time slot.
[02:37:23.939 --> 02:37:25.040]  They said, no more politics.
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:26.100]  We'll even pay you more money.
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:26.761]  No more.
[02:37:26.841 --> 02:37:31.844]  And I said, I don't have any passion to talk about relationships and sports.
[02:37:32.004 --> 02:37:32.824]  I said, you're joking.
[02:37:34.025 --> 02:37:35.206]  And they said, no, or you're fired.
[02:37:36.334 --> 02:37:39.616]  So, it's like a carpet of gold or a carpet of bombs, like they told the Afghans.
[02:37:39.636 --> 02:37:50.663]  And I said, well, and I didn't really BS them, but I said, I didn't Bravo Sierra them, but I said, I'll try, tell me specifically, but I don't, this is popular, you're making money, I'm not even getting paid that much, I'm telling the truth.
[02:37:50.683 --> 02:37:55.006]  Because, you know, we were getting national attention back in 1999, and they fired me.
[02:37:55.547 --> 02:38:02.011]  So, I've been where Ben Schwann is, when they come in and say, you're going to cover local stuff and not get on people's nerves.
[02:38:02.811 --> 02:38:04.733]  You know, we're getting all sorts of phone calls up here.
[02:38:05.492 --> 02:38:07.995]  And of course, later I learned that the Feds had given him a visit and stuff.
[02:38:08.356 --> 02:38:10.358]  And see, that's how the intimidation works in America.
[02:38:10.618 --> 02:38:21.492]  Get a federal phone call, Feds visit, you know, the bosses up in Scranton, Ohio, or wherever it is, and then they come down to find out what's going on with this guy.
[02:38:22.674 --> 02:38:25.856]  I mean, they didn't like me talking about stuff going on here in Texas.
[02:38:25.876 --> 02:38:37.322]  I'd already started, though, a little syndicated show out of my house, so when they said, you're fired, get out of here, because they had new management, get out of here, you crazy person, I just said, well, I've already got a show.
[02:38:37.342 --> 02:38:37.863]  I'll be all right.
[02:38:37.883 --> 02:38:39.083]  They said, no, you don't.
[02:38:39.644 --> 02:38:40.904]  You're done in the media.
[02:38:41.105 --> 02:38:47.788]  They really were like having a victory and trying to dance on my journalistic and media life.
[02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:50.550]  I don't savor a lot of things.
[02:38:50.590 --> 02:38:53.052]  I don't even savor that because it makes me sick for those people.
[02:38:54.573 --> 02:38:59.597]  Of how small they were and how they all later got fired and they're all a bunch of joke, you know, failures pretty much now.
[02:39:00.057 --> 02:39:10.605]  It's sad for them that people really get in to being worldly failures and they love seeing other people who have pure hearts or purer hearts than they fail.
[02:39:11.005 --> 02:39:16.549]  And Ben, I know you've been friendly towards Fox when you left, but I mean you struck out on your own here and let's talk about
[02:39:16.869 --> 02:39:17.249]  I don't know.
[02:39:39.313 --> 02:39:40.655]  I'm kind of perseverating here.
[02:39:41.275 --> 02:39:48.863]  Tell us about your media operation and how people can find out more about that and help breathe even more life into it.
[02:39:49.384 --> 02:39:55.170]  Well, one of the things that we decided to do, it's called the Truth in Media Project, and the idea was that we were going to start creating
[02:39:55.650 --> 02:40:03.515]  Similar to what we did with Reality Check, create these 5-6 minute long videos that explain to people a lot of what's going on that mainstream media won't cover.
[02:40:03.615 --> 02:40:08.437]  Now, I'll tell you Alex, things have changed over the last few weeks as we started to build this project out.
[02:40:08.497 --> 02:40:15.902]  One of the things that we started to do now is see the need and the value in being able to create some high-end quality video content
[02:40:16.582 --> 02:40:19.024]  Just to give to alternative media sites.
[02:40:19.064 --> 02:40:37.077]  And the reason for that is because, as you know, one of the games that's being played with this whole idea of the intellectual property rights and these bills that we've been talking about, like CISPA, is that if you use a clip from someone's show, even though it's fair use, if you use a clip out there, you use some video on your website, your site's going to get shut down.
[02:40:37.217 --> 02:40:38.398]  That's the idea behind it.
[02:40:38.718 --> 02:40:43.764]  So what we want to do is kind of fill a void there and say, you know what, let's create this content and let's just, let's just give it away.
[02:40:43.864 --> 02:40:49.350]  So all these alternative media sites, and we've been setting up with a lot of them, is to say, you know what, you guys can just have it.
[02:40:49.410 --> 02:40:50.491]  Just don't edit it apart.
[02:40:50.591 --> 02:40:51.352]  Don't cut it down.
[02:40:51.412 --> 02:40:57.719]  Don't, you know, take license and say, well, we'll run this little piece of the things are out of context, but it's, you know, we're going to give it away for free.
[02:40:57.799 --> 02:40:59.001]  And that's been kind of the idea
[02:40:59.241 --> 02:41:00.542]  I instinctively always said everything I've put out
[02:41:18.622 --> 02:41:24.084]  Uh, is, is copyright, uh, national retain the copyright so they can't change it or alter it or twist it.
[02:41:24.525 --> 02:41:26.485]  Or then say, okay, now we own it, you don't.
[02:41:26.745 --> 02:41:28.506]  You have to retrain something as you're doing.
[02:41:28.746 --> 02:41:39.871]  But as long as it's not taken out of context, and it's for non-profit educational purposes, or even fair use, clearly by the guidelines that are, everybody knows, then you can use everything we've done.
[02:41:39.891 --> 02:41:42.512]  And that has been one reason we've been so successful as well.
[02:41:42.992 --> 02:41:43.913]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:41:43.953 --> 02:41:54.282]  I think, you know, I really respect the fact that you're a guy who, obviously, you've built up a media empire of your own, but I've never seen you competitive with other people.
[02:41:54.302 --> 02:41:57.284]  And I've always seen you working to build up other people, and that's fantastic.
[02:41:57.324 --> 02:41:58.565]  And that's what we want to do, too.
[02:41:58.605 --> 02:42:02.208]  We want to build up other sites who say, listen, we're video poor right now.
[02:42:02.248 --> 02:42:03.930]  We don't have the ability to create this stuff.
[02:42:04.290 --> 02:42:05.571]  We're creating stuff in Chicago.
[02:42:05.631 --> 02:42:06.212]  We're shooting it.
[02:42:06.972 --> 02:42:11.396]  The stuff that we're putting out, I mean, candidly, it's better than what a lot of networks are putting out.
[02:42:11.796 --> 02:42:14.638]  And so we're very excited about the quality of what we're about to put out.
[02:42:15.298 --> 02:42:17.279]  But then we say, look, so how do we use this?
[02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:18.860]  How is it most beneficial to people?
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:30.367]  Well, we get it out to the public, we share it, we give it away for free, we place it on streaming sites, but we don't see it as a, hey, you know, this is Ben's stuff and Ben's got to make his stuff so that he can build up his kind of empire over here.
[02:42:30.387 --> 02:42:31.028]  It's not that at all.
[02:42:31.608 --> 02:42:41.418]  And I know you understand that philosophy, but that's essentially what we're trying to do, is we're trying to augment where there's a lot of bloggers out there, there's a lot of writers, there's a lot of people putting out good content.
[02:42:41.779 --> 02:42:50.167]  How do we augment the video side of it, where so far it's been kind of a struggle, especially for smaller sites, where video, as you know, is expensive to produce?
[02:42:50.828 --> 02:42:51.749]  Well, that's our plan.
[02:42:51.769 --> 02:42:53.070]  That's why I've hired a bunch of reporters.
[02:42:53.090 --> 02:42:56.914]  We're almost done with our studio, looking at the different satellite uplinks and all of it.
[02:42:57.354 --> 02:43:00.937]  And we're just going to put it basically free to air, even to the establishment media.
[02:43:01.257 --> 02:43:03.179]  And they're going to end up using a lot of what we develop.
[02:43:03.459 --> 02:43:07.003]  We're actually developing reporter contacts and people that just want to get their info out.
[02:43:07.483 --> 02:43:07.623]  We're
[02:43:25.325 --> 02:43:26.686]  I want my freedom back.
[02:43:27.126 --> 02:43:31.787]  I want to dig these globalists out of their rat holes who are openly persecuting.
[02:43:31.807 --> 02:43:36.909]  I mean, it came out today with Snowden going, oh yeah, no, they target the press to know what the press is going to do.
[02:43:36.929 --> 02:43:37.869]  Well, that's already come out.
[02:43:38.149 --> 02:43:46.132]  I mean, we have them illegally spying on us and to frustrate the press and sending the IRS after pro-life groups saying you can't protest dead children.
[02:43:46.152 --> 02:43:48.433]  I mean, this is authoritarianism.
[02:43:48.893 --> 02:43:51.254]  And the answer is, is to just have everybody
[02:43:51.954 --> 02:43:57.179]  I mean, even if you don't have a lot of skills, start your own weekly YouTube blog where you talk about stuff.
[02:43:57.500 --> 02:43:58.401]  Start a newsletter.
[02:43:58.441 --> 02:43:59.442]  Start a local paper.
[02:44:00.062 --> 02:44:01.864]  Go get a local weekend radio show.
[02:44:02.084 --> 02:44:03.206]  Go do an access show.
[02:44:03.466 --> 02:44:05.888]  Everybody has got to do something now.
[02:44:06.669 --> 02:44:06.909]  Right.
[02:44:06.949 --> 02:44:13.456]  Well, and as more voices come out, you know, all of a sudden the stuff that right now people would call fringe is no longer fringe.
[02:44:13.496 --> 02:44:14.377]  It becomes mainstream.
[02:44:14.457 --> 02:44:19.698]  And as we've been talking about, mainstream starts chasing that because they realize there's a huge audience for it.
[02:44:19.738 --> 02:44:24.359]  And it's not an audience because you're building off sensationalism, it's an audience because you're building off truth.
[02:44:24.739 --> 02:44:29.181]  And when there's a lack or an absence of truth in mainstream, people are going to find it.
[02:44:29.221 --> 02:44:30.101]  They're going to seek it out.
[02:44:30.801 --> 02:44:31.581]  And so we've seen that.
[02:44:31.721 --> 02:44:40.123]  And we see this happening even with this latest attempt by the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, trying to redefine who is really a journalist.
[02:44:40.143 --> 02:44:43.144]  And if you don't work for a paid organization, if you don't work for a corporation,
[02:44:43.584 --> 02:44:46.646]  Ben, suddenly you're no longer a journalist and not protected under S.H.I.E.L.D.
[02:44:46.686 --> 02:44:46.986]  laws?
[02:44:47.006 --> 02:44:55.531]  I mean, that is something that every American should be aware of, because what you're essentially saying is, we will decide who is a journalist, therefore, who gets protection.
[02:44:55.711 --> 02:45:03.636]  Oh yeah, oh, Dianne Feinstein has jumped the shark here, saying you've got to be salaried by a corporate entity, or you're not a journalist.
[02:45:03.676 --> 02:45:05.117]  I mean, that is outrageous.
[02:45:05.777 --> 02:45:06.037]  It is.
[02:45:06.397 --> 02:45:07.678]  It's absolutely outrageous.
[02:45:07.738 --> 02:45:12.119]  And she claims, you know, this is because of the Shield Law, so we have to be able to define who the journalists are.
[02:45:12.139 --> 02:45:12.920]  Well, why?
[02:45:13.260 --> 02:45:23.884]  Because the Shield Law is set up so that when a whistleblower comes to you and says, here's what's going on in this government agency, you as a journalist are able to talk to them and you're able to protect your source.
[02:45:24.244 --> 02:45:25.964]  She doesn't want you to be able to protect your source.
[02:45:26.244 --> 02:45:29.946]  What she wants is for you to have to go to the New York Times as a whistleblower and say to them,
[02:45:30.686 --> 02:45:31.887]  Hey, I have a story I want to tell.
[02:45:32.188 --> 02:45:43.639]  Number one, they either refuse to tell your story, or two, they use their sources back at the DOD or Homeland Security or whoever, and they say to them, oh, by the way, this guy is about to blow the whistle on you guys.
[02:45:43.739 --> 02:45:47.562]  Oh yeah, it's on record that it just is all run by the CIA, folks.
[02:45:48.303 --> 02:45:52.507]  I mean Greenwald had to go over to the Guardian to get his stuff out and they're infiltrated as well.
[02:45:52.527 --> 02:46:04.938]  I'm not saying Greenwald is but I mean it's on record that when you go to the New York Times or CBS or NBC or these guys that they're simply handing it off to the government and it's simply amazing
[02:46:05.558 --> 02:46:15.522]  That they're doing this, but I don't see any way they're going to be able to stop us, no matter how much cyber... Because they admit, cyber security has been built to shut down the free web.
[02:46:16.223 --> 02:46:17.943]  It's been built to end the free press.
[02:46:18.123 --> 02:46:22.485]  Greenwald came out and said, we've been reading over NSA documents a few days ago.
[02:46:24.366 --> 02:46:25.146]  It's incredible.
[02:46:25.927 --> 02:46:30.889]  It's meant to shut down the free press and end the internet as we know it and bring in a sanitized control one.
[02:46:31.109 --> 02:46:38.953]  That's what Internet2's always been about for 15 years that the group's been meeting with academia, the European and U.S.
[02:46:38.973 --> 02:46:39.753]  Defense Departments.
[02:46:40.193 --> 02:46:41.214]  It's the takeover.
[02:46:41.454 --> 02:46:44.455]  They're not going to allow us to operate and challenge their lies.
[02:46:44.895 --> 02:46:46.536]  So they're going to try to shut us down, folks.
[02:46:46.836 --> 02:46:48.277]  This is a war.
[02:46:48.697 --> 02:46:52.459]  They obsess over DrudgeReport.com that they don't control.
[02:46:52.799 --> 02:46:55.701]  They obsess over Infowars.com that they don't control.
[02:46:56.001 --> 02:46:56.962]  They obsess!
[02:46:57.302 --> 02:47:03.706]  Well, the answer is, realize they're in an offense against us because our offense is winning, and intensify our war!
[02:47:04.067 --> 02:47:16.735]  Just go completely ape in the Infowar and decry it all, because everything MSNBC does, and they're an open White House organ, is they try to define what's acceptable, what's not, who should cover what, who should do what.
[02:47:17.035 --> 02:47:20.397]  They're always lecturing other media, lecturing Libertarian Republicans.
[02:47:20.818 --> 02:47:22.359]  Oh, Alex Jones is evil, don't listen to him.
[02:47:23.299 --> 02:47:27.842]  Because the stuff continues to come out and be real and be serious and cause them problems.
[02:47:28.203 --> 02:47:30.184]  Or don't go to drugs, don't go to these other sites.
[02:47:30.524 --> 02:47:33.466]  They're doing this because they're weak, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:33.666 --> 02:47:36.448]  The answer is do the opposite of whatever they say.
[02:47:36.728 --> 02:47:41.451]  Because every, I mean, look, I intellectually know that 9 times out of 10 the opposite of what they say is true.
[02:47:41.692 --> 02:47:44.694]  But just as an action, whatever they want, don't do it.
[02:47:44.974 --> 02:47:47.155]  Whatever they say, look into it, it's a lie.
[02:47:48.096 --> 02:47:49.897]  Realize they're not just propagandists.
[02:47:50.137 --> 02:47:51.598]  They are criminal enemies.
[02:47:51.658 --> 02:47:52.499]  I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[02:47:52.939 --> 02:47:55.082]  No, no, you're making a good point though.
[02:47:55.343 --> 02:47:59.949]  And look, just take for instance what John Kerry just said to the State Department.
[02:48:00.249 --> 02:48:08.060]  He was speaking about the internet and he said that the internet has made it much more difficult to govern than at any other time in history.
[02:48:08.721 --> 02:48:19.167]  And when he was explaining his remarks, he actually says that during the Cold War, it was a lot easier because of the way that communist countries were controlling information.
[02:48:19.528 --> 02:48:28.373]  And he says, and then at the end of the Cold War, it became much more difficult, and then came along, he says, a little thing called the Internet, and it's made it very, very difficult to govern.
[02:48:28.573 --> 02:48:31.115]  Well, he's not saying govern, he's saying control.
[02:48:31.815 --> 02:48:32.535]  I'm very difficult.
[02:48:32.555 --> 02:48:33.316]  Dictate our lives.
[02:48:33.396 --> 02:48:34.416]  Tell us what to do.
[02:48:35.137 --> 02:48:37.498]  They meant to build it as a worldwide wiretap.
[02:48:37.538 --> 02:48:40.000]  That was really its name, the nickname at DARPA, as you know.
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:43.581]  And now we're using the worldwide wiretap to take them down.
[02:48:43.982 --> 02:48:49.205]  We're using it as, we're taking it over and flipping the script against them.
[02:48:49.565 --> 02:48:51.506]  And I'm telling you, they're scared now, and they should be.
[02:48:52.006 --> 02:48:52.886]  Yeah, well, absolutely.
[02:48:52.926 --> 02:48:59.149]  And I think as we continue to watch the response from people, and again, this is what's so important, watch the response of the public.
[02:48:59.689 --> 02:49:09.553]  The public did not buy into the NSA is okay, the NSA protected us from 50 terror attacks that we can't tell you about, and we refuse to give information to Congress about.
[02:49:10.273 --> 02:49:17.296]  You know, the NSA was able to spot this supposed terror threat against embassies around the world the other day.
[02:49:18.057 --> 02:49:19.057]  No one's buying this.
[02:49:19.237 --> 02:49:20.998]  And so I think what you're seeing now is this
[02:49:21.858 --> 02:49:40.271]  Kind of this critical moment where the NSA scandal may be, as we look back on it in history, the moment when the American public stopped believing the narrative coming from corporate media, stopped believing the narrative coming from politicians, and started listening to those alternative voices, and the alternative became the mainstream.
[02:49:40.985 --> 02:49:46.288]  And if the people just go, hey, I can make up my own mind historically, I can check into what I want, then it's over.
[02:49:46.308 --> 02:49:49.410]  Because then they're not even just listening to us, they're listening to common sense.
[02:49:50.010 --> 02:49:51.531]  And that's the big issue here.
[02:49:52.291 --> 02:49:58.755]  You better believe, though, that the burden of proof on guys like you and me is substantially higher than it is on mainstream.
[02:49:59.055 --> 02:50:03.998]  We have to be able to back up every single thing that we say, because we're going to go through the shredder if we don't.
[02:50:04.358 --> 02:50:11.965]  Well, yeah, but it's like Coke saying that aspartame has no bad health effects when there's Harvard studies, Princeton, you know, I mean, there's no debating it.
[02:50:13.346 --> 02:50:14.567]  And the stuff makes you fat.
[02:50:14.707 --> 02:50:16.268]  And then they're saying it doesn't make you fat.
[02:50:16.569 --> 02:50:21.513]  I mean, they're just losing all credibility now because they think the old lie still works.
[02:50:21.953 --> 02:50:27.018]  And it may work on people that are like jellyfish, but it doesn't work on a larger and larger segment of the population.
[02:50:27.038 --> 02:50:27.678]  We're going to break.
[02:50:28.138 --> 02:50:30.661]  I got to come back and ask you to give us tidbits.
[02:50:31.221 --> 02:50:33.643]  That the NSA is coming after people now.
[02:50:33.663 --> 02:50:36.585]  Because I know if you say this, you've got the report, you say it's coming out Monday.
[02:50:37.866 --> 02:50:41.468]  Via copyright, and I'm guessing, is it for the symbol of the NSA?
[02:50:41.488 --> 02:50:43.710]  I mean, they're saying you can't even talk about them, basically?
[02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:45.291]  Essentially, yeah.
[02:50:45.531 --> 02:50:46.972]  I'll give you some more when we come back from the break.
[02:50:46.992 --> 02:50:51.335]  I mean, the New York Stock Exchange told us you're not even allowed to aim a camera at our building.
[02:50:51.795 --> 02:50:53.577]  And of course, I know in law that's not true.
[02:50:53.637 --> 02:50:54.497]  I'm newsgathering.
[02:50:55.458 --> 02:50:56.359]  It's a public interest.
[02:50:56.459 --> 02:50:57.399]  I'm allowed to show their building.
[02:50:57.639 --> 02:50:59.421]  But they go, no, we have copyright.
[02:51:00.462 --> 02:51:01.822]  Uh, now they're saying the name!
[02:51:01.882 --> 02:51:02.763]  You can't even say it.
[02:51:02.823 --> 02:51:03.903]  I'll say it all I want.
[02:51:04.243 --> 02:51:08.964]  New York Stock Exchange are a bunch of swindling crooks owned by foreign banks, sucking the country dry.
[02:51:09.484 --> 02:51:11.565]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[02:51:11.825 --> 02:51:18.087]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them, if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[02:51:18.447 --> 02:51:26.449]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:51:26.969 --> 02:51:31.072]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:51:31.753 --> 02:51:35.596]  One World Whey is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:51:35.876 --> 02:51:43.642]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids, and all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[02:51:44.023 --> 02:51:47.565]  With our TrueCool™ process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[02:51:47.906 --> 02:51:48.826]  My name is Daniel.
[02:51:48.927 --> 02:51:50.107]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:51:50.148 --> 02:51:52.890]  When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:51:52.950 --> 02:51:53.010]  Now,
[02:51:54.771 --> 02:51:57.652]  After two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:51:57.812 --> 02:51:58.932]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:51:59.112 --> 02:52:06.375]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:52:06.435 --> 02:52:08.855]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:52:09.816 --> 02:52:11.896]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:52:12.216 --> 02:52:19.439]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:52:22.159 --> 02:52:22.359]  I'm good.
[02:52:41.639 --> 02:52:48.321]  It contains a two-month supply for one person, or a one-month supply for two adults, or a two-week supply for a family of four.
[02:52:48.601 --> 02:52:49.682]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[02:54:04.290 --> 02:54:15.960]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:16.660 --> 02:54:19.002]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:20.123 --> 02:54:26.889]  On a lighter note, if you're a radio listener, you should know that Ben Swan looks like the long-lost twin brother of Ryan Seacrest.
[02:54:27.757 --> 02:54:35.520]  Uh, but I guess Ryan Seacrest is like the evil worldly twin, and then you've got Ben Swan, the patriotic, liberty-loving, uh, person.
[02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:36.880]  I'm sorry, Ben.
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:40.721]  Ben, cause the guys pointed this out, cause I didn't really even know who Ryan Seacrest is.
[02:54:40.761 --> 02:54:46.103]  I've heard the name, I know he does, you know, like DJ stuff on TV and radio, but have you been compared to Ryan Seacrest before?
[02:54:47.283 --> 02:54:48.804]  Ryan Seacrest many, many times.
[02:54:49.184 --> 02:54:51.025]  I'm like the poor man's version of Ryan Seacrest.
[02:54:53.150 --> 02:54:54.750]  Oh my goodness, oh boy.
[02:54:55.711 --> 02:54:57.111]  Man, so much is going on.
[02:54:57.331 --> 02:54:58.792]  Tell us about the NSA story.
[02:54:58.812 --> 02:55:00.152]  I mean, as much as you can.
[02:55:00.532 --> 02:55:00.812]  Sure.
[02:55:01.292 --> 02:55:05.573]  Listen, the bottom line here is it's a guy who has a t-shirt company.
[02:55:05.713 --> 02:55:06.854]  He's not a big player.
[02:55:07.674 --> 02:55:12.235]  He creates a lot of different designs that, you know, kind of poke fun at the police state.
[02:55:12.715 --> 02:55:15.136]  And he designs a couple with NSA logos on them.
[02:55:15.456 --> 02:55:17.778]  And they're clearly parodies.
[02:55:17.838 --> 02:55:20.881]  We're going to show you in the story exactly what the design looks like.
[02:55:20.901 --> 02:55:23.483]  We're going to break down for you exactly how it works under rule of law.
[02:55:23.984 --> 02:55:25.885]  And this guy's totally covered.
[02:55:25.905 --> 02:55:26.926]  There's no question about it.
[02:55:27.246 --> 02:55:36.014]  But the NSA doesn't contact him directly, just contacts all the sites where he's posting his merchandise and getting those companies to pull the merchandise down.
[02:55:36.494 --> 02:55:37.996]  Uh, claiming it's copyright infringement.
[02:55:38.036 --> 02:55:39.738]  And this goes back to what we were talking about.
[02:55:40.059 --> 02:55:45.866]  That the NSA doesn't have to be able to go to court and say, look judge, here's what we believe is copyright infringement.
[02:55:46.166 --> 02:55:49.190]  We believe that he's, he's, um, you know, infringing on our logo.
[02:55:49.711 --> 02:55:51.453]  The judge would look at it and say, it's a parody.
[02:55:51.753 --> 02:55:52.394]  You don't have a case.
[02:55:52.554 --> 02:55:53.374]  They don't have to do that.
[02:55:53.534 --> 02:55:56.995]  Plus, plus, for those that don't know, it's a government taxpayer funded deal.
[02:55:57.256 --> 02:56:01.737]  They have basically no rights unless you were trying to impersonate and then that's a felony.
[02:56:01.957 --> 02:56:06.279]  I mean, this is just outrageous and they admit that's what CISPA and SOPA is about.
[02:56:06.299 --> 02:56:08.219]  That's absolutely what it's about.
[02:56:08.259 --> 02:56:11.740]  And so, but that's what is so important for people to understand.
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:13.121]  This isn't about a t-shirt company.
[02:56:13.161 --> 02:56:19.743]  This is about testing the waters to say how are we going to make sure that we don't, we don't even have to prove anything under rule of law.
[02:56:19.963 --> 02:56:22.325]  We're simply going to hammer the small guy.
[02:56:22.545 --> 02:56:25.207]  We're going to take away his right to be able to talk about us.
[02:56:25.227 --> 02:56:27.409]  We're going to take away everyone's right to talk about us.
[02:56:27.489 --> 02:56:28.630]  That's what the issue is here.
[02:56:28.870 --> 02:56:30.291]  You just hit the nail on the head right there.
[02:56:30.712 --> 02:56:34.455]  So many people that don't get it go, I don't care if they shut down coal power plants.
[02:56:34.695 --> 02:56:35.295]  I don't own that.
[02:56:35.635 --> 02:56:37.537]  I don't care if they shut down that guy's t-shirt company.
[02:56:38.057 --> 02:56:41.941]  If they can shut down power plants, our power prices all go up.
[02:56:42.081 --> 02:56:43.342]  And then ship our jobs to China.
[02:56:43.522 --> 02:56:47.285]  If they can shut down somebody when it's open parity and free speech, we all lose it.
[02:56:47.825 --> 02:56:52.371]  I mean, people just need to get folks that when they screw somebody else, you're getting it too.
[02:56:52.671 --> 02:56:55.535]  I mean, that's a basic instinct of a free people.
[02:56:55.555 --> 02:56:56.316]  Can you speak to that?
[02:56:56.596 --> 02:57:03.045]  Well, no, and I think that what the other point there is that you better understand that they don't care about the t-shirt company either.
[02:57:03.805 --> 02:57:07.408]  When the NSA comes after the guy with the t-shirt company, they don't care about that.
[02:57:07.768 --> 02:57:17.035]  They care about taking steps because, remember this, that under our judicial system... They're trying to block her free speech and shut down political dissent, which they've been doing with the press!
[02:57:17.055 --> 02:57:17.716]  They're criminals!
[02:57:17.936 --> 02:57:18.697]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:57:18.717 --> 02:57:23.620]  But remember, under the judicial system that we have, judges don't look at the Constitution.
[02:57:23.641 --> 02:57:25.342]  The Supreme Court doesn't look at the Constitution.
[02:57:25.682 --> 02:57:26.703]  They look at precedent.
[02:57:27.063 --> 02:57:39.271]  And so when they go in and take away some guy's right to free speech in a t-shirt company, the judge in the next case doesn't look at the Constitution, they look at precedent and say, well, they took away the t-shirt company's guy's right, so I guess they can do it here too.
[02:57:39.591 --> 02:57:41.373]  That's how the system's being played out now.
[02:57:41.673 --> 02:57:51.099]  So you better care about the t-shirt company, not for the reason that you might have a financial or vested interest in his company, but that you have a vested interest in your own right.
[02:57:51.119 --> 02:57:51.599]  Oh, that's it.
[02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:56.783]  I'm coming out with a shirt that says NSA with their symbol and then Nazi-Soviet assault.
[02:57:57.404 --> 02:57:58.645]  I mean, I'll do whatever I want!
[02:57:58.665 --> 02:58:00.427]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:00.527 --> 02:58:02.008]  And you have, that would be a parody.
[02:58:02.248 --> 02:58:04.010]  Under rule of law, that's a parody.
[02:58:04.491 --> 02:58:09.636]  It's a little bit different than satire, which there's some, you know, legal issues there, but clearly what you're talking about is a parody.
[02:58:09.656 --> 02:58:19.046]  As long as you take their logo, their image, and make fun of it, then you're guaranteed protection under law, but not guaranteed under this current political climate.
[02:58:20.183 --> 02:58:20.843]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:21.623 --> 02:58:24.984]  And they're now being caught harassing media, trying to control things.
[02:58:25.324 --> 02:58:25.764]  Duh!
[02:58:25.804 --> 02:58:27.245]  Why do governments spy on people?
[02:58:27.845 --> 02:58:33.546]  And then doing fake terror alerts, which they now got caught, were fake terror alerts, but that's back of the newspaper.
[02:58:33.826 --> 02:58:37.927]  But it's not back of the newspaper at your website or at my website.
[02:58:38.288 --> 02:58:41.628]  Final segment, straight ahead with our guest, Ben Swan.
[02:58:41.668 --> 02:58:42.689]  BenSwan.com.
[02:58:43.129 --> 02:58:44.969]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:58:45.009 --> 02:58:47.370]  And the revolution in real media starts here.

[03:00:21.976 --> 03:00:25.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.181 --> 03:00:30.265]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.726 --> 03:00:34.029]  Well, it's been a good banter between I and Ben Swan.
[03:00:35.202 --> 03:00:37.743]  Everything he talks about gets me so excited, all these issues.
[03:00:38.083 --> 03:00:40.763]  Here's some of the news I haven't gotten to, up at InfoWars.com.
[03:00:41.464 --> 03:00:41.664]  U.S.
[03:00:41.684 --> 03:00:44.264]  sends warship to Bahrain in response to protest.
[03:00:45.085 --> 03:00:45.805]  Absolutely.
[03:00:46.065 --> 03:00:47.725]  This is not the U.S., it's the global empire.
[03:00:48.125 --> 03:00:52.547]  Rubio, Obama may sign executive order legalizing illegals.
[03:00:52.567 --> 03:00:55.227]  Yeah, he's been saying he won't let Congress get in the way of what he needs to do.
[03:00:56.088 --> 03:00:56.948]  Our new dictator.
[03:00:57.588 --> 03:01:01.269]  Rand Paul, Obama's actions on health care legislation are illegal and unconstitutional.
[03:01:01.909 --> 03:01:04.970]  Teenager denied heart transplant over history of non-compliance.
[03:01:05.611 --> 03:01:06.911]  Didn't make good grades in school?
[03:01:07.091 --> 03:01:07.872]  You die.
[03:01:07.892 --> 03:01:12.774]  NAACP attacks rodeo, stunt, and political satire.
[03:01:12.794 --> 03:01:14.094]  That's what we were just talking about.
[03:01:14.694 --> 03:01:17.356]  MIT, future smartphones will listen to everything all the time.
[03:01:17.776 --> 03:01:18.316]  Well, why not?
[03:01:18.336 --> 03:01:19.216]  I mean, they did in 1984.
[03:01:19.336 --> 03:01:20.157]  It's for your own good.
[03:01:20.817 --> 03:01:24.418]  And Alex Jones to receive Obama clown sensitivity training.
[03:01:24.438 --> 03:01:26.940]  That's a joke, satire video, but it's pretty popular.
[03:01:28.180 --> 03:01:29.262]  We got about four minutes left.
[03:01:29.282 --> 03:01:34.693]  I want to give you the floor here to get into other issues, things you think should be transmitted to the audience out there, Ben Schwann.
[03:01:35.512 --> 03:01:47.375]  Well, I think one of the things that we're trying to do with this project and that we've been looking into, there is such a problem in this country, and I know you talk about this a lot, Alex, of crony capitalism.
[03:01:47.795 --> 03:01:56.517]  And so one of the things we're really trying to break through with this project is to help people understand the difference between free market freedom, individual liberty, and capitalism.
[03:01:56.837 --> 03:02:03.319]  And the current system we have, which is a crony capitalist system, some people call it fascism, this collusion between government
[03:02:03.419 --> 03:02:03.519]  Yeah.
[03:02:22.492 --> 03:02:32.034]  It should be disconcerting to people to see, again, the collusion between government and corporations in order to create these desired outcomes.
[03:02:32.374 --> 03:02:39.496]  And ultimately, none of it is done with an interest in your freedom, your liberty, and your rights as an American citizen.
[03:02:39.536 --> 03:02:41.657]  And I think we're watching all of that slip away.
[03:02:41.737 --> 03:02:46.258]  So, through all these headlines that we see over and over and over, I think we keep getting back to the same
[03:02:46.778 --> 03:02:50.861]  Central themes and that's where I really hope that people are catching on.
[03:02:50.881 --> 03:02:52.342]  There's a theme to all of this.
[03:02:52.722 --> 03:02:55.584]  So the story of the day may change, but the theme doesn't.
[03:02:56.464 --> 03:03:00.807]  The particular headline might change, but the root of the problem doesn't.
[03:03:00.867 --> 03:03:05.070]  And so hopefully we're gonna, with other folks like you, continue to break through that.
[03:03:06.107 --> 03:03:07.028]  Look at this headline.
[03:03:07.068 --> 03:03:11.231]  The Missouri State Commission has ordered that all rodeo clowns undergo sensitivity training.
[03:03:11.912 --> 03:03:22.901]  So, Stephen Colbert can make fun of the president, but they can go pick on one group and now say, you've all got to go pay, I looked it up, it's like $500 in that state, to go be taught how to be a good communist.
[03:03:24.743 --> 03:03:25.724]  Or none of you can work.
[03:03:26.264 --> 03:03:28.405]  I mean, this is just so screwed up.
[03:03:28.465 --> 03:03:29.565]  It's so Soviet.
[03:03:29.605 --> 03:03:32.506]  It's not even politically correct, even though that's a Soviet term.
[03:03:32.786 --> 03:03:33.946]  These are authoritarians.
[03:03:34.186 --> 03:03:36.487]  How about the government go through Constitution training?
[03:03:36.847 --> 03:03:37.407]  How about that?
[03:03:38.127 --> 03:03:38.868]  Well, absolutely.
[03:03:38.928 --> 03:03:49.071]  Look, and at the end of the day, the host and the announcer for the rodeo have both resigned their positions, and they're both out of jobs now in relation to this.
[03:03:49.171 --> 03:03:50.551]  And here comes the Secret Service.
[03:03:50.611 --> 03:03:51.371]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:03:51.411 --> 03:03:53.672]  Yeah, there are calls for the Secret Service to investigate.
[03:03:53.892 --> 03:03:56.334]  Secret Service needs to look into whether or not you're making fun of the President.
[03:03:56.354 --> 03:03:58.215]  Clown mask, Obama, red alert!
[03:03:58.515 --> 03:04:00.636]  And meanwhile, all our liberties are being destroyed.
[03:04:00.656 --> 03:04:02.037]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[03:04:02.378 --> 03:04:08.261]  Well, the most unbelievable thing about that is the fact that a rodeo clown in Missouri can get this kind of attention.
[03:04:08.742 --> 03:04:14.865]  It's such a non-story, and yet it is like sucking up all the oxygen from all these different spaces.
[03:04:14.925 --> 03:04:17.507]  Never mind the government funding Al Qaeda and fake terror alerts.
[03:04:17.727 --> 03:04:19.929]  Did you hear a guy had a mask on and a bull chased him?
[03:04:20.569 --> 03:04:21.189]  That's what they do!
[03:04:21.250 --> 03:04:22.450]  The bulls chase the clowns!
[03:04:22.510 --> 03:04:24.252]  I mean, obviously it's anti-Obama!
[03:04:24.452 --> 03:04:25.933]  We hate this New World Order puppet!
[03:04:50.529 --> 03:04:51.630]  Well, that doesn't matter.
[03:04:51.690 --> 03:04:53.432]  The guy was wearing an Obama mask.
[03:04:53.672 --> 03:04:54.673]  Did you see it, folks?
[03:04:55.194 --> 03:04:56.976]  NAACP says arrest him.
[03:04:57.336 --> 03:04:58.357]  SWAT teams are needed.
[03:04:58.377 --> 03:05:00.359]  A family in Dallas had three inch grass.
[03:05:00.659 --> 03:05:01.320]  SWAT teamed.
[03:05:01.580 --> 03:05:03.362]  Ben Swan, great job of what you're doing.
[03:05:03.382 --> 03:05:04.403]  Look forward to talking to you soon.
[03:05:04.723 --> 03:05:05.224]  God bless.
[03:05:05.544 --> 03:05:06.025]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:05:06.245 --> 03:05:06.585]  You bet.
[03:05:06.946 --> 03:05:07.266]  All right.
[03:05:09.668 --> 03:05:10.850]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:11.070 --> 03:05:19.238]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts
