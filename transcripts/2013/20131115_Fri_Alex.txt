[00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:09.840]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.420]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.961]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:17.163]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:26.448]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.448 --> 00:00:33.032]  Man, I've got a lot of incredible news to cover today, as we do every day, but it does literally, as you know, get crazier by the minute.
[00:00:35.748 --> 00:00:49.759]  But I sent one of my crew members up to Dallas to poke around for the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination and just to find out the lay of the land and what's going on.
[00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:59.787]  They're actually planning on blocking, not just right around Dealey Plaza, that's the official story on the city website and on the Dallas Morning News.
[00:00:59.787 --> 00:01:02.669]  They're planning to block it about four or five blocks down
[00:01:03.607 --> 00:01:07.728]  And basically shut down a third of downtown Dallas.
[00:01:07.728 --> 00:01:13.089]  And they tried to claim, the city tried to claim no bullhorns, no demonstrations in the city, period.
[00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:15.270]  And declared there was no First Amendment.
[00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.671]  A lawsuit was filed and an injunction was handed down.
[00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:27.673]  And now much of what the city has been trying to do
[00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:29.586]  I don't think so.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.562]  And I'm going to be in Dallas next Wednesday night, and I will announce the location on Infowars.com.
[00:01:57.562 --> 00:02:07.706]  Wednesday night, you will check it on your smartphones if you choose to take this mission, and he will put up the flyers in legal and lawful areas Thursday.
[00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:14.688]  They will pull them down from legal and lawful areas, public commons areas where other handbills are posted under common law.
[00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:17.449]  They'll only tear ours down and claim it's illegal.
[00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:18.670]  We will then hit them again
[00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.831]  Friday and again Saturday.
[00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:25.793]  They're going to have the entire international media there.
[00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:27.755]  Billions will be tuning in.
[00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:38.924]  And they want to try to sell the fraud that a lone unicorn fired a bullet out of a school book building through two trees and hit the president.
[00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:44.529]  And then the magic lucky charms Easter Bunny bullet was able to do all this.
[00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:45.730]  We're not there to debate that.
[00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.672]  We've won 90 plus percent.
[00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:52.034]  Of Americans at major polls even higher with Europeans.
[00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:55.595]  No, the government killed Kennedy, a shadow element of the government.
[00:02:55.595 --> 00:03:05.037]  We've had the lawyers go public, the mistresses go public, the hitman commander go public, E. Howard Hunt.
[00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:06.977]  On and on and on and on.
[00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:13.359]  By the way, he was fingered as the commander of the operation on the ground, the ground captain, the quarterback, you could say, of the big event.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.561]  Sued Liberty Lomby and lost.
[00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:24.702]  The court found there was evidence E. Howard Hunt was there and he later admitted, I was there backbenching and running the big event.
[00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:32.584]  We were going to kill him in Miami and then Chicago, but that Secret Service agent blew the whistle in Chicago.
[00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:33.805]  So Dallas was the place.
[00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:37.105]  Of course, Texas always gets the job done.
[00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:38.606]  But the point is, is that
[00:03:39.994 --> 00:03:45.739]  I'm not proud of us down here, but we do seem to do what we say we're going to do, historically.
[00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.502]  And the whole point is, is that the main event happened in Dallas 50 years ago.
[00:03:50.502 --> 00:03:55.767]  And listen, they could be saying they're shutting the city of Dallas down, there's no free speech for gay people.
[00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:57.368]  And I would probably go up there and demonstrate.
[00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:08.071]  I mean, they could be saying they're having an anti-dog rally, or an anti-Christian rally, or whatever, and that no one was allowed to come and protest it.
[00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:08.792]  I would show up.
[00:04:08.792 --> 00:04:10.433]  I don't care if it's a group I disagreed with.
[00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:14.356]  If they were trying to take the Black Panthers' rights away, I'd be up there against it.
[00:04:14.356 --> 00:04:20.841]  If they were trying to take the Ku Klux Klan's right to speak away, I would support it.
[00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:23.243]  Because if they can take theirs, they can take mine, folks.
[00:04:23.243 --> 00:04:26.205]  They've already butchered the 4th Amendment, 10th Amendment, 2nd Amendment.
[00:04:27.944 --> 00:04:31.548]  But it really is hitting me how big a deal this is.
[00:04:31.548 --> 00:04:33.651]  So a lot of my crew's gonna be down there.
[00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:35.172]  I'm gonna be there.
[00:04:35.172 --> 00:04:36.334]  And, you know, it's my hometown.
[00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:40.158]  I was born less than a mile from where Kennedy got his head blown off.
[00:04:41.477 --> 00:04:45.158]  And, uh, I was born in the hospital right next to Parkland.
[00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:46.558]  There's two of them right there.
[00:04:46.558 --> 00:04:52.980]  The point is, is that I'm going back to my hometown to let folks know the First Amendment exists.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.782]  Come hell or high water, and we are now going to hand out 100,000 flyers and a lot more.
[00:04:58.782 --> 00:04:59.162]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:07.361]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:09.742]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:10.202]  The U.S.
[00:05:10.202 --> 00:05:14.424]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:05:14.424 --> 00:05:17.386]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:18.887]  They want that attack to come.
[00:05:18.887 --> 00:05:25.050]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.131]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:33.094]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:05:33.094 --> 00:05:40.517]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:05:40.837 --> 00:05:43.600]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.682]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:51.266]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:05.913]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:13.302]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:06:13.302 --> 00:06:16.667]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.429]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.332]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:26.254]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:32.198]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:06:32.198 --> 00:06:35.880]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.124]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:06:41.124 --> 00:06:44.106]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:44.346 --> 00:06:50.328]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:06.404]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:07:06.404 --> 00:07:15.288]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:07:15.288 --> 00:07:23.111]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:30.514]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:07:31.014 --> 00:07:34.978]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:07:34.978 --> 00:07:39.161]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:07:39.161 --> 00:07:46.328]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.

[00:07:53.534 --> 00:07:57.578]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:08:17.648 --> 00:08:24.172]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:33.177]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.177 --> 00:08:41.663]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday worldwide transmission.
[00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:43.844]  It is the 15th day of November 2013
[00:08:48.817 --> 00:08:58.145]  Seven days from now, I will be broadcasting live from outside Dealey Plaza.
[00:08:58.145 --> 00:09:10.656]  Because no one who doesn't agree with the official story, including Dan Rather, I've read, are allowed into the kill zone.
[00:09:10.656 --> 00:09:14.720]  The people that killed Kennedy and the power structure that killed Kennedy
[00:09:16.124 --> 00:09:32.809]  To bring in the black ops CIA offshore banking coup d'etat are going to be there trying to prop up the collapsed facade that is the official story of what happened to John F. Kennedy in 1963 on November 22nd.
[00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:34.430]  We've won the info war.
[00:09:42.366 --> 00:09:53.033]  When it comes to exposing that it was a black op, the average poll is 90% or higher, scientific poll, believing that there is a conspiracy and a cover-up.
[00:09:53.033 --> 00:10:05.000]  Congress, back in the 70s, found with a 99% certainty, that's the quote, that it was a multi-shooter conspiracy from the acoustics and witnesses to kill John F. Kennedy.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.485]  Now you know that the Warren Commission covered it up years before and was filled with people that were enemies of Kennedy
[00:10:12.304 --> 00:10:23.748]  And we know they killed his brother, and the police department report says that Sirhan Sirhan got his arm pinned, none of the shots went into John F. Kennedy's brother, Bobby Kennedy, the list goes on and on.
[00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:30.671]  The establishment assassinated two people that actually tried to be real presidents.
[00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:38.494]  One who became president, was a real president, certainly not perfect, I don't romanticize him, had his own gangster tendencies.
[00:10:38.494 --> 00:10:39.054]  The other one,
[00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:44.079]  Tried to become president and said that once he did, he was going to go after him.
[00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:45.499]  And that's all on record.
[00:10:45.499 --> 00:10:50.422]  They think you're stupid, just like they think you wouldn't read Obamacare and they could get it through.
[00:10:50.422 --> 00:10:53.223]  Folks didn't read it, but now they know it's a screwjob.
[00:10:53.223 --> 00:11:01.106]  It's on record how they killed Kennedy, and it's on record how they killed his brother, the younger Kennedy.
[00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:08.470]  But that's not why I'm going to Dallas next Wednesday night, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, because they're going to continue the propaganda the next day.
[00:11:09.298 --> 00:11:15.182]  They would never give any other group the Dealey Plaza Park.
[00:11:15.182 --> 00:11:22.346]  They would never give a historical group, a research group, a permit to hold a demonstration or rally there.
[00:11:22.346 --> 00:11:29.571]  And they have the school book building as a giant propaganda center of lies and deception and fraud.
[00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:34.514]  They've rolled out everyone from Bugliosi to Tom Hanks.
[00:11:36.298 --> 00:11:40.919]  To try to prop up the collapsed Humpty Dumpty that's in a million pieces.
[00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:49.482]  And all the king's horses and all the king's men and all the propagandists can't put their asinine lie back together again.
[00:11:49.482 --> 00:11:52.322]  Then they march the Patsy out.
[00:11:52.322 --> 00:11:54.583]  Lee Harvey Oswald, I'm a Patsy, they're setting me up!
[00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:56.303]  Don't let them kill me!
[00:11:56.303 --> 00:11:57.244]  March him outside.
[00:11:57.244 --> 00:12:01.645]  And then they march the Marine out to kill him.
[00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:27.680]  Another, Timothy McVeigh, literally, a military officer, believing he was deep cover infiltration of communists in plots to kill Kennedy so they could shut him up and blame communists if they wanted to, but then they used the threat against the Russians for concessions that we're going to set you up with our double agent that we sent to Russia and allowed back in, run by white Russians here in the U.S.
[00:12:28.988 --> 00:12:30.309]  That doesn't mean white people, folks.
[00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:34.331]  Every time I talk about black slavery, white slavery, people don't even know the different types of them.
[00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:36.613]  They deal with black people or white people.
[00:12:36.613 --> 00:12:37.834]  Same thing with white Russians.
[00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:40.235]  It just means pro-Tsarist.
[00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:50.021]  But the issue is, is that if you know the history, they 100% set him up and then killed him publicly.
[00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:52.103]  He was the Patsy part of the drill.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:13.652]  And the moral of the story is, if you're a Marine and they want you to simulate going to kill the President, or they want you to infiltrate some kind of Patriot group that they claim is terrorist, the Patriot group's really a bunch of Feds planning something, and they're going to set you up.
[00:13:13.652 --> 00:13:20.818]  Just like in Mark Wahlberg's excellent film, that at the end of the film they basically admit is a composite
[00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:29.121]  Of what happened with Kennedy, but then repeated in modern times with an example of a criminal combined government running things.
[00:13:29.121 --> 00:13:33.044]  That film, The Shooter, or is it just Shooter?
[00:13:33.044 --> 00:13:36.468]  Should be required viewing.
[00:13:36.468 --> 00:13:37.028]  Shooter.
[00:13:37.028 --> 00:13:38.550]  Just Shooter.
[00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:44.075]  Should be required viewing because it explains exactly how they do these things, okay?
[00:13:48.749 --> 00:13:58.675]  And I know that a lot of Hollywood script writers and producers back when I would still go out to Los Angeles interviewed me and claimed they wanted me to have a writing credit on things.
[00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:07.079]  I even sat down multiple times with major directors and producers and writers with scripts basically like the shooter.
[00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.321]  Now that doesn't mean my ideas are actually in the shooter.
[00:14:10.526 --> 00:14:14.068]  Hollywood's fully awake to this kind of stuff.
[00:14:14.068 --> 00:14:19.411]  And they're not just doing revelation of the method or externalization of the hierarchy as a propaganda ploy.
[00:14:19.411 --> 00:14:20.972]  They know what's going on.
[00:14:20.972 --> 00:14:25.055]  And they're kept on a very short leash by the big agency owners.
[00:14:25.055 --> 00:14:31.279]  They're kept on a very short leash by the heads of the studios.
[00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:38.363]  But I saw a bunch of scripts very similar to Shooter, except one of them had Sigourney Weaver
[00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:47.244]  In it, playing the part of somebody in the White House, shut up and a false flag.
[00:14:47.244 --> 00:14:50.165]  Well, Sigourney Weaver was the president in it.
[00:14:50.165 --> 00:14:56.748]  But then there was another script, and I don't mean just scripts floating around Hollywood, I mean high-level meetings with, like, major A-list directors.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:06.167]  Sitting there in like five hour meetings, picking my brain about the New World Order assassination, black ops, false flags.
[00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:11.752]  And then I have seen some of those same names make different movies than they were looking at making, but very similar.
[00:15:11.752 --> 00:15:12.573]  It's just strange.
[00:15:17.486 --> 00:15:19.167]  And what do I get out of it?
[00:15:19.167 --> 00:15:20.007]  Nothing!
[00:15:20.007 --> 00:15:25.970]  Except, you know, Hollywood making the, you know, wanted child kidnapper named Alex Jones in the new movie.
[00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.372]  I mean, it's just all sorts of nice little things they do.
[00:15:29.372 --> 00:15:34.075]  The point is, is that I meander around.
[00:15:34.075 --> 00:15:40.638]  I start talking about one subject, it leads into another, and then leads into another, because believe me, this is teleprompter-free radio.
[00:15:40.638 --> 00:15:41.979]  Teleprompter-free television.
[00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:53.933]  Now, let me just stop for a minute and kind of reset here and tell you what's coming up today.
[00:15:53.933 --> 00:15:57.857]  Let me just do this because I hardly ever get to the video clips, the audio clips.
[00:15:57.857 --> 00:16:02.020]  This is the type of stuff I have just today in my video clips.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:12.029]  Oprah Winfrey, BBC, many disrespect Obama because he's black, not because he is a criminal front man.
[00:16:13.882 --> 00:16:28.291]  Now actually, a lot of folks are embarrassed and upset at the system using a part-black guy to sell all this fraud on the backs of people hoping for reconciliation and for a colorblind society.
[00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:32.934]  What they are is totally betraying people's trust and goodwill.
[00:16:32.934 --> 00:16:37.817]  And then calling people that wake up racist when they're being run over by Team Obama.
[00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:41.766]  And his legion of criminals.
[00:16:41.766 --> 00:16:51.153]  CBS's Major Garrett confronts Obama on broken keep your plan promises.
[00:16:51.153 --> 00:16:54.316]  There's a new interview where he gets confronted.
[00:16:54.316 --> 00:16:58.119]  Congressman exposes DHS buildup for civil unrest.
[00:16:58.119 --> 00:17:00.560]  Secret police force, not a conspiracy.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.301]  No, it's in the bill.
[00:17:01.301 --> 00:17:06.165]  The show is paying for implanted microchips in the citizenry.
[00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:09.228]  I mean, I've scanned over the bill, folks.
[00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:13.749]  It is 10,000 pages plus of addendums and writers.
[00:17:13.749 --> 00:17:17.230]  3,000 plus pages of the actual bill.
[00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:28.494]  And the stuff in there is so bad in Obamacare that you're reading it and you're like, this allows the insurance companies to quadruple within three years of it being implemented, 2016.
[00:17:31.653 --> 00:17:36.597]  It allows them to quadruple the average, and it's going to double the first year.
[00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:39.279]  And you're reading this, and you're going, there's no way.
[00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:41.601]  You go, no, the public will put up with that, actually.
[00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:44.904]  They don't want to be racist, so they'll do it.
[00:17:44.904 --> 00:17:49.588]  I mean, it's like literally throw your child in a wood chip or you're racist, and the average Trinity would do it.
[00:17:56.687 --> 00:18:02.689]  It continues, Hillary Clinton in 2007 says you can keep your plan if you like at the same bull.
[00:18:02.689 --> 00:18:04.570]  It's just the same quarterbacking from the Globalists.
[00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.531]  They're just front puppets that basically broadcast and repeat the Globalist message.
[00:18:09.531 --> 00:18:17.494]  McAfee's come out and said that the site is executing a denial of service attack on itself.
[00:18:17.494 --> 00:18:20.595]  That's actually what Mike Adams, who's a really good programmer, said first.
[00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:23.542]  The first day it wasn't working.
[00:18:23.542 --> 00:18:25.844]  The first day it came out, he said, this isn't set up.
[00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:27.605]  And a bunch of other programmers have said that now, too.
[00:18:27.605 --> 00:18:28.105]  Yeah.
[00:18:28.105 --> 00:18:28.806]  No, no, that's the point.
[00:18:28.806 --> 00:18:30.167]  It's not meant to work, folks.
[00:18:30.167 --> 00:18:33.509]  So it all becomes, oh, you can't get the free thing because it's broken.
[00:18:33.509 --> 00:18:34.169]  Oh, that's all right.
[00:18:34.169 --> 00:18:40.373]  Oh, you meant, well, the site is broken.
[00:18:40.373 --> 00:18:43.015]  Spying on you works 100% perfectly.
[00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:45.456]  Integrating everything you do into one government database.
[00:18:45.456 --> 00:18:47.338]  But they can't let you go into an exchange.
[00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:53.836]  Or it's like a, basically eBay, and you just can pick, you know, different... I mean, it's just total... Watch.
[00:18:53.836 --> 00:18:57.318]  You'll never get your free health care until it's death care.
[00:18:57.318 --> 00:18:58.698]  And you will get that, finally.
[00:18:58.698 --> 00:19:04.801]  But you're gonna pay private corporations thousands of dollars per pill they make you swallow, okay, when they're done.
[00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:06.482]  And you're gonna love it!
[00:19:06.482 --> 00:19:06.862]  I get it.
[00:19:06.862 --> 00:19:14.325]  That's why they're gonna take your bank accounts, lower the wages, break the country, de-industrialize, shut everything down, force-inoculate your kids.
[00:19:14.645 --> 00:19:17.707]  Take your 11-year-old to have an abortion without you giving authorization.
[00:19:17.707 --> 00:19:22.471]  Because they know sheep suckers when they see it.
[00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:29.536]  These gangsters know people that are done like a hog that's been hauled up by its ankles and had its throat slit.
[00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:30.957]  You bled out.
[00:19:30.957 --> 00:19:32.118]  It's time to smoke ya.
[00:19:34.192 --> 00:19:41.275]  And you'll be sitting there on that smoker burning, and when it comes time, you'll say, I'm done on this side, please flip me.
[00:19:41.275 --> 00:19:42.936]  And they'll say, shut up, terrorist!
[00:19:42.936 --> 00:19:51.400]  Karate chop you right in the throat, and gurgling through blood, you will thank them, as they gouge your eyeballs out with big red pokers.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.581]  Anyways, we got a bunch of news coming up.
[00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:55.222]  Sorry I'm so extreme.
[00:19:55.222 --> 00:19:57.903]  I don't like being robbed and financially raped.
[00:19:57.903 --> 00:19:59.424]  I should roll over to take it!

[00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:51.342]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride.
[00:24:12.568 --> 00:24:19.373]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[00:24:19.373 --> 00:24:21.915]  But I am still alive.
[00:24:21.915 --> 00:24:23.397]  Hard to turn this song off.
[00:24:23.397 --> 00:24:24.197]  I was a sailor.
[00:24:41.448 --> 00:24:48.394]  I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide.
[00:24:48.394 --> 00:24:52.218]  With the sea I did abide.
[00:24:52.218 --> 00:24:59.084]  I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[00:24:59.084 --> 00:25:02.226]  I went aloft at Pearl, the mainsail in a blow.
[00:25:04.938 --> 00:25:09.179]  And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed.
[00:25:09.179 --> 00:25:10.560]  But I'm livin' still.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.820]  But I'm livin' still.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.041]  They got some Waylon Jennings comin' up.
[00:25:17.041 --> 00:25:22.063]  I was a dam builder, across the river deep and wide.
[00:25:22.063 --> 00:25:23.843]  Steel and water didn't collide.
[00:25:23.843 --> 00:25:26.524]  Where steel and water didn't collide.
[00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:27.464]  A place called Boulder.
[00:25:28.983 --> 00:25:34.887]  That's right, it's Advanced Karaoke with Alex Jones.
[00:25:34.887 --> 00:25:39.250]  And unfortunately I'm not gonna play the whole song.
[00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.912]  There it is, The Highwaymen.
[00:25:41.912 --> 00:25:43.553]  Isn't that the song?
[00:25:43.553 --> 00:25:45.394]  It's by The Highwaymen.
[00:25:45.394 --> 00:25:46.615]  The first song.
[00:25:46.615 --> 00:25:47.956]  The first ballad.
[00:25:47.956 --> 00:25:50.757]  Talk about a outlaw country.
[00:25:50.757 --> 00:25:55.401]  Talk about don't have one song on their five albums.
[00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:56.241]  It isn't... That ain't...
[00:25:57.862 --> 00:25:59.783]  This is insane.
[00:25:59.783 --> 00:26:02.183]  Oh, I can't... I can't stop.
[00:26:02.183 --> 00:26:03.303]  Here he comes!
[00:26:03.303 --> 00:26:05.344]  Johnny Cash, baby!
[00:26:05.344 --> 00:26:09.045]  I'll fly a starship across the universe divine.
[00:26:09.045 --> 00:26:16.747]  When I reach the other side... And when I reach the other side... I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can.
[00:26:16.747 --> 00:26:19.868]  I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can.
[00:26:19.868 --> 00:26:21.048]  Perhaps I may become...
[00:26:21.648 --> 00:26:28.556]  You know, it's all about not caring, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:28.556 --> 00:26:41.650]  You know, I don't think this song, and I'll actually talk to Willie about it, is so much about, and he agreed with me, me and Willie were talking over some, over a chess board,
[00:26:42.782 --> 00:27:04.153]  But the whole point is, is that I was saying, is that song about reincarnation or is it more about how adventurism and humanity could continue on to the stars and how others will live on and then our genetics live on into the future as long as there is trailblazing and adventure.
[00:27:04.153 --> 00:27:08.776]  And he said, I can't copy the way Willie Nelson talks, but he's like,
[00:27:12.304 --> 00:27:13.944]  I think that's exactly what it's saying.
[00:27:13.944 --> 00:27:16.385]  I think that's exactly what we meant.
[00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:26.868]  Because I play that song, sometimes I play the intro of it, the first 30 seconds or so.
[00:27:26.868 --> 00:27:29.669]  I've never played the whole song or a large chunk of it.
[00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:35.990]  And people are like, what's he doing playing that reincarnation stuff on there?
[00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.831]  Well, I am the genetic
[00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:42.246]  Reincarnation of all my ancestors.
[00:27:42.246 --> 00:27:44.646]  That's pretty heavy right there.
[00:27:44.646 --> 00:27:48.027]  Folks ever think about that?
[00:27:48.027 --> 00:27:52.349]  And that's why I don't like cheating other people and going after other people.
[00:27:52.349 --> 00:27:56.750]  I mean, we're all related to each other one way or another.
[00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.390]  I don't care where you are in the world.
[00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.831]  You trace your roots back to Africa.
[00:28:01.315 --> 00:28:08.201]  And it's just, literally, it doesn't matter if people are like rats, it doesn't matter if they're low down and evil, it doesn't matter.
[00:28:08.201 --> 00:28:11.284]  You know, when somebody's trying to crush you, you gotta go ahead and crush them.
[00:28:11.284 --> 00:28:12.345]  But it doesn't mean I enjoy it.
[00:28:12.345 --> 00:28:18.691]  It doesn't mean that, you know, there's vipers and scum out there that have to be dealt with and, you know, good people deal with them.
[00:28:18.691 --> 00:28:21.933]  I think one of, you know, good folks' biggest problem is we don't tend to stand up for ourselves.
[00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:22.374]  We need to.
[00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:27.586]  But we also need to build up and hold up the innocent.
[00:28:27.586 --> 00:28:36.580]  That's our number one job, is to come to the aid of people that are having their rights violated, people that are being overrun, because that's how we all stand together or we hang separate.
[00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.011]  And I haven't even gotten to the news.
[00:28:39.011 --> 00:28:39.911]  This is a short segment.
[00:28:39.911 --> 00:28:44.053]  I'm going to control myself and be well-behaved, and I'm going to come back focused.
[00:28:44.053 --> 00:28:52.357]  Problem is, I go over all this news at night and in the morning, and then once I get here, it's kind of like, man, do I really need to tell everybody this stuff?
[00:28:52.357 --> 00:28:58.941]  Because let me tell you, it is big, and it is bad, and it is stinky.
[00:28:58.941 --> 00:29:06.685]  But it's kind of like lancing a big boil that's on the bottom of your foot or something where you step on a rusty nail.
[00:29:08.089 --> 00:29:13.714]  And then it's hurting really bad and it swells up and you hadn't gone to the doctor and you hadn't told your parents about it.
[00:29:13.714 --> 00:29:17.057]  Get home from school and it's all swollen up and red and hurting.
[00:29:17.057 --> 00:29:27.426]  And you just go get a knife out of the block and you heat it up red hot and just stick it in there and all that pus comes out of there and it feels so good.
[00:29:27.426 --> 00:29:31.490]  And I think that's kind of... I did that once when I was a kid.
[00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:33.852]  I think that's kind of what this comes down to.
[00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:42.335]  I didn't know why I knew how to cauterize a wound, but see, all the genetic information is right there.
[00:29:42.335 --> 00:29:45.678]  I've got everything my ancestors had right there.
[00:29:45.678 --> 00:29:47.020]  Combat ready.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.882]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.882 --> 00:29:51.284]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.284 --> 00:29:53.806]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.806 --> 00:29:56.509]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.962 --> 00:30:03.984]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:30:03.984 --> 00:30:08.987]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:30:08.987 --> 00:30:16.171]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:30:16.311 --> 00:30:21.937]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[00:32:00.993 --> 00:32:07.617]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:32:07.617 --> 00:32:10.098]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:32:10.098 --> 00:32:10.458]  The U.S.
[00:32:10.458 --> 00:32:14.680]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.662]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:32:17.662 --> 00:32:19.143]  They want that attack to come.
[00:32:19.143 --> 00:32:25.346]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:32:25.706 --> 00:32:28.390]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:33.358]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:32:33.358 --> 00:32:40.790]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.854]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:32:43.854 --> 00:32:46.957]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:32:46.957 --> 00:32:51.523]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[00:32:51.523 --> 00:32:56.108]  Available only at InfoWarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:33:15.916 --> 00:33:20.898]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:28.660]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.681]  Revolution in their minds!
[00:33:31.681 --> 00:33:36.883]  The children start to march.
[00:33:36.883 --> 00:33:41.664]  How about counter-revolution against tyranny?
[00:33:41.664 --> 00:33:43.525]  There is a revolution.
[00:33:45.436 --> 00:33:48.217]  of oppression.
[00:33:48.217 --> 00:34:00.500]  And I personally am not going to stand here idly by and let our society be engineered into one based on fraud and deceit instead of innovation, honor and enlightenment.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.480]  It's very, very simple.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:14.163]  And folks out there need to decide historically, historically, what decision we want to make now in the present going in to the breach, which is the future.
[00:34:16.718 --> 00:34:20.819]  We're in a forward-leaning time warp, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:20.819 --> 00:34:31.722]  If you look at the quantum mechanics, the rush of the universe goes by us, through us, and we flow with it.
[00:34:31.722 --> 00:34:44.865]  And when you realize that, it's such a joke to be obsessed with the pomp and circumstance and red carpets and all of the fake status garbage, which means absolutely nothing.
[00:34:46.149 --> 00:35:05.912]  If it is projected by the establishment because the establishment wants you to be obsessed with issues of little or no significance so that they can rule the future destiny of this species and steer us into oblivion because that is their great goal.
[00:35:23.373 --> 00:35:29.998]  Let me just do this.
[00:35:29.998 --> 00:35:33.640]  Let me just do this here on air.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.361]  There's so much I want to get to.
[00:35:35.361 --> 00:35:37.042]  And that's the problem.
[00:35:37.042 --> 00:35:43.847]  I get in here and I look at all this news and it is just it is just too insane to even sometimes even try to get into it.
[00:35:43.847 --> 00:35:44.548]  It makes my head spin.
[00:35:44.548 --> 00:35:46.569]  We're going to get the latest on Obamacare.
[00:35:46.569 --> 00:35:47.950]  Big economic developments.
[00:35:51.158 --> 00:35:56.402]  Just just just all sorts of internet freedom takeovers.
[00:35:56.402 --> 00:36:00.705]  It's all coming up.
[00:36:00.705 --> 00:36:03.227]  Here today.
[00:36:03.227 --> 00:36:04.689]  And.
[00:36:04.689 --> 00:36:08.391]  Expanding.
[00:36:08.391 --> 00:36:10.513]  Expanding on it.
[00:36:10.513 --> 00:36:13.115]  Just briefly.
[00:36:13.115 --> 00:36:18.900]  I wanted to just remind listeners.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.160]  That.
[00:36:23.507 --> 00:36:36.263]  Well, we have a lot of important news I want to get to here, but I wanted to remind listeners here today that the reason I'm promoting atomic proprietary
[00:36:38.004 --> 00:36:54.194]  Iodine is because I did the research from the mainline medical studies, the nutritionists, you name it, you've heard many of them here on the air, that iodine and the pure forms of iodine are one of the biggest secrets that the establishment is keeping from the public.
[00:36:54.194 --> 00:36:55.315]  And it's hidden in plain view.
[00:36:55.315 --> 00:36:57.717]  I mean just as they put the dangerous halogens
[00:36:58.786 --> 00:37:08.854]  The fluorine, all the rest of the garbage in the water and the food that we don't need that's so toxic and bad, they then keep the good iodine out of the food supply knowingly.
[00:37:08.854 --> 00:37:21.204]  Back before our government was eugenics run, was only partially eugenics run from the 20s into the 50s, they basically mandated the food producers to put iodine in the food.
[00:37:21.204 --> 00:37:24.067]  And then of course, I have the studies right here.
[00:37:24.067 --> 00:37:25.528]  I could show TV viewers.
[00:37:27.148 --> 00:37:35.736]  How adding iodine to salt resulted in a decade's worth of IQ gains for the United States, a 15 point increase, and that's in major studies.
[00:37:35.736 --> 00:37:38.319]  That's from Business Insider.
[00:37:38.319 --> 00:37:41.602]  Again, here's the Harvard study from Reuters.
[00:37:41.602 --> 00:37:44.144]  Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's IQ.
[00:37:44.144 --> 00:37:48.849]  So they put something in the water that reduces IQ on record at the level they're putting it in.
[00:37:50.959 --> 00:37:54.361]  And then they remove the thing that your brain's gotta have.
[00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:58.944]  I mean, there's all the studies about chromosomal disorders, retardation.
[00:37:58.944 --> 00:38:05.228]  I mean, there's a whole bunch of disorders directly linked to iodine deficiency in pregnant women.
[00:38:05.228 --> 00:38:07.429]  And they don't tell women they need iodine.
[00:38:07.429 --> 00:38:09.670]  Period.
[00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.673]  So yes, I promote things that fund our operation and make us strong and be able to expand.
[00:38:19.682 --> 00:38:23.344]  With things that I believe in and that I know are really good.
[00:38:23.344 --> 00:38:25.046]  And so we did get more of this in.
[00:38:25.046 --> 00:38:29.468]  They did expand the size of the laboratory where this is produced.
[00:38:29.468 --> 00:38:32.410]  And this is the best iodine that I could find for myself and my family.
[00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.271]  It's unbonded.
[00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:34.992]  It's pure.
[00:38:34.992 --> 00:38:37.834]  It's InfoWars Life Survival Shield available at InfoWars.
[00:38:39.574 --> 00:38:45.280]  Life.com, that's InfoWarsLife.com or link through at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.102]  It also has a link to it there.
[00:38:47.102 --> 00:38:51.327]  And we also have what they say is an organic form of nascent iodine.
[00:38:51.327 --> 00:38:52.188]  We're very close to it.
[00:38:52.188 --> 00:38:55.051]  It's still partially bound, but very good for you, I'm told, from all the research.
[00:38:55.051 --> 00:38:56.373]  And I certainly feel it.
[00:38:56.373 --> 00:38:59.316]  The modifial in the southern hemisphere, brown seaweed.
[00:39:00.177 --> 00:39:03.921]  So that's available at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsStore.com as well.
[00:39:03.921 --> 00:39:05.802]  And I don't know how long we can run this special.
[00:39:05.802 --> 00:39:08.505]  It's the biggest special we've ever done.
[00:39:08.505 --> 00:39:15.191]  20% off right now on ProPure, Pro1, the entire family of systems.
[00:39:15.191 --> 00:39:17.834]  And again, I'm making, I think, $2 on the little pitchers.
[00:39:19.264 --> 00:39:23.909]  Because there's already hardly any markup in those, so when I got 20% on that, it just gets red.
[00:39:23.909 --> 00:39:30.756]  Additional 10% off that we do on the regular 10%, literally, that is right at a loss leader.
[00:39:30.756 --> 00:39:31.636]  So, there you go.
[00:39:31.636 --> 00:39:34.159]  InfowarsStore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:39:41.875 --> 00:39:46.497]  Or you can simply, again, go to Infowars.com and link through there.
[00:39:46.497 --> 00:39:50.578]  Okay, let's just read some of the headlines here that are up on Infowars.com.
[00:39:50.578 --> 00:39:52.578]  Let's just do this.
[00:39:52.578 --> 00:39:53.159]  Report!
[00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:57.180]  Obama is an actor trained by Harry Lennox.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:03.662]  And that was said on a newsroom floor at Fox TV Studios in Chicago in front of six people at least.
[00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:12.853]  Four of them that work for Eric Mahler, and two of them that were other guests, and he literally trashed him for ten minutes, they said.
[00:40:12.853 --> 00:40:14.413]  They said it was unbelievable.
[00:40:14.413 --> 00:40:20.896]  In fact, Mancow didn't even say some of it on air, because he said he didn't want to... Lennox didn't say, don't talk about it, but he said he just wasn't going to say it.
[00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:22.537]  Put it to you that way.
[00:40:22.537 --> 00:40:25.278]  He practically lived with him, was the quote.
[00:40:26.452 --> 00:40:27.673]  Let's continue here.
[00:40:27.673 --> 00:40:32.137]  Janet Yellen, the new Fed boss, is pumping up the bubble machine.
[00:40:32.137 --> 00:40:33.618]  He thought QE Unlimited was bad.
[00:40:33.618 --> 00:40:34.079]  Get ready.
[00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:37.362]  And, of course, they had a high-level Fed officer go public two days ago.
[00:40:37.362 --> 00:40:38.803]  We covered it here on air.
[00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:40.885]  And he said that he apologizes.
[00:40:40.885 --> 00:40:42.786]  This is the greatest transfer of wealth in U.S.
[00:40:42.786 --> 00:40:45.448]  history and a robbery of our children's future.
[00:40:46.209 --> 00:40:48.292]  It's a criminal takeover by foreign banks.
[00:40:48.292 --> 00:40:50.335]  He now concurs with us.
[00:40:50.335 --> 00:40:53.719]  See, once you speak the great truth aloud, it begins to echo around forever.
[00:40:53.719 --> 00:40:56.002]  CIA looking at your financial transactions.
[00:40:56.002 --> 00:40:57.384]  Kurt Nemo's written about that.
[00:40:57.384 --> 00:40:59.346]  The New York Times has a whitewash article out.
[00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:10.777]  Congressman Worms of Obamacare Security, Secret Security Force, and we're going to play that clip, we have it queued up, coming up here in just a moment.
[00:41:10.777 --> 00:41:18.002]  Also, Obamacare fix affirms Obama as absolute dictator with power to change the laws as he pleases.
[00:41:18.002 --> 00:41:24.366]  And this is what Bongino, the famous Secret Service, Dan Bongino, talks about when he's coming on in the third hour.
[00:41:24.366 --> 00:41:28.729]  Our story last week from InfoWars.com went viral via DrugsReport.com.
[00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:30.891]  Biggest story we ever put out.
[00:41:30.891 --> 00:41:42.981]  We had more traffic off of that one story than anything else ever, for whatever reason, at InfoWars.com because he said, you have no idea how bad Obama really is.
[00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:44.502]  I've signed national security agreements.
[00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:47.004]  I can't tell you, but you have no idea.
[00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:48.905]  It's far worse than you think.
[00:41:48.905 --> 00:41:53.169]  Well, I happen to know from another Secret Service source,
[00:41:54.494 --> 00:41:56.195]  Inside the White House.
[00:41:56.195 --> 00:41:57.975]  And I hate even talking about stuff like this, folks.
[00:41:57.975 --> 00:41:59.096]  This is dangerous.
[00:41:59.096 --> 00:42:00.597]  And it's nothing that could even get me killed.
[00:42:00.597 --> 00:42:02.917]  It's just because they don't tell me anything specific.
[00:42:02.917 --> 00:42:05.719]  It's just, oh my God, you're absolutely right.
[00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:07.699]  I can't, I can't, I've got to get out of here.
[00:42:07.699 --> 00:42:09.680]  I've got to get a transfer.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.741]  It's unbelievable.
[00:42:10.741 --> 00:42:11.981]  It's unbelievable.
[00:42:11.981 --> 00:42:13.062]  God help America.
[00:42:13.062 --> 00:42:13.782]  Keep warning them.
[00:42:16.223 --> 00:42:19.824]  And then I talked to another Secret Service agent over the phone.
[00:42:19.824 --> 00:42:22.585]  I was with a famous person whose friends with him put me on.
[00:42:22.585 --> 00:42:25.446]  He was showing me pictures with him and stuff.
[00:42:25.446 --> 00:42:29.967]  And this person I know has been to the White House quite a bit.
[00:42:29.967 --> 00:42:35.849]  And the guy started basically crying on the telephone to me.
[00:42:35.849 --> 00:42:42.411]  Okay, it's bad enough, folks, that the Secret Service is crying.
[00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:42.971]  Crying.
[00:42:45.674 --> 00:42:50.680]  You know, I know why the public wants to sit there and say I'm full of it and, oh, it's an exaggeration.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.521]  Because you know what?
[00:42:51.521 --> 00:42:53.784]  I wish every day I was a liar.
[00:42:53.784 --> 00:42:55.846]  I wish it wasn't this bad.
[00:42:55.846 --> 00:42:56.848]  I wish I wasn't right.
[00:42:56.848 --> 00:43:00.452]  Because let me tell you, folks, I cry sometimes.
[00:43:00.452 --> 00:43:04.157]  And I'm the type of guy that's had, like, compound fractures and stuff and didn't cry.
[00:43:05.202 --> 00:43:06.763]  I get mad when I get hurt.
[00:43:06.763 --> 00:43:08.404]  This is a spiritual thing.
[00:43:08.404 --> 00:43:16.650]  When you realize, and you look at your children, and they're innocent, and they're good, and you realize that the evil's hanging over them, involuntarily, I don't like start retching and crying.
[00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:19.933]  Tears just start pouring out my eyes.
[00:43:19.933 --> 00:43:27.878]  They just start coming out, because my brain is grieving so hard, folks, harder than when family members have died.
[00:43:27.878 --> 00:43:29.580]  In fact, when I start talking about it, my eyes start watering.
[00:43:32.106 --> 00:43:34.107]  It's beyond... I used to get chills up and down my spine.
[00:43:34.107 --> 00:43:35.588]  I don't really get that anymore.
[00:43:35.588 --> 00:43:37.829]  I get it sometimes.
[00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:48.094]  I start my... I start literally tearing up, ladies and gentlemen, because when you realize that we're in the hands of evil... See, there it goes right there.
[00:43:53.693 --> 00:43:55.836]  See, I got all this news and I can't even read it.
[00:43:55.836 --> 00:43:57.878]  I just, it's just like, what is the point?
[00:43:57.878 --> 00:44:03.404]  What, add more to just all the hellish stuff that's going on and how much trouble we're in?
[00:44:03.404 --> 00:44:06.407]  And the sadness that we have to go through this and put up with this?
[00:44:06.407 --> 00:44:08.830]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.293]  And that's where the pain gives way to anger.
[00:44:11.293 --> 00:44:13.916]  Because the anger is basically a defense mechanism.
[00:44:21.095 --> 00:44:22.897]  I do need to take a vacation, I'll tell you right now.
[00:44:22.897 --> 00:44:25.199]  But there is no taking a vacation when all this is going on.
[00:44:25.199 --> 00:44:28.402]  Because I can't turn it off anyways.
[00:44:28.402 --> 00:44:32.746]  In the face of this tyranny, we must all stand up and speak out and tell the truth.
[00:44:32.746 --> 00:44:35.529]  And I realize I am pre-grieving.
[00:44:35.529 --> 00:44:39.432]  It's like a pre-nostalgia, but an anti-nostalgia.
[00:44:39.432 --> 00:44:41.955]  Like I realize the nightmare, almost like a vision.
[00:44:43.356 --> 00:44:47.239]  I've already seen the carnage, seen that my understanding has been corrected to this point.
[00:44:47.239 --> 00:44:47.939]  It's not hard.
[00:44:47.939 --> 00:44:49.740]  The globalists brag what they're going to do.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.902]  And it's like, wow, this nightmare is coming true.
[00:44:51.902 --> 00:44:53.343]  They really are going to do it.
[00:44:53.343 --> 00:44:58.567]  They really are going to break up our families, shoot us all up with deadly vaccines that kill even more of us.
[00:44:58.567 --> 00:45:00.528]  They really are poisoning the food and water.
[00:45:00.528 --> 00:45:02.689]  They really are using all of our energy.
[00:45:02.689 --> 00:45:11.235]  Look at the light posts and the buildings and the helicopters and the weapons and the aircraft carriers and the NSA bases and the power grids.
[00:45:12.489 --> 00:45:17.271]  All this stuff that our tax money and our energy and our work paid for.
[00:45:17.271 --> 00:45:18.792]  We built this.
[00:45:18.792 --> 00:45:21.874]  And now they're not building any of that anymore.
[00:45:21.874 --> 00:45:33.059]  All they're building is select infrastructure they own and control that's given to select offshore Spanish and Portuguese and British and Dutch and globalist royalty, you know, owned companies.
[00:45:34.725 --> 00:45:48.497]  And they're transferring all our wealth and the infrastructure to them to control us and dominate us and crush us through a high-tech siege.
[00:45:48.497 --> 00:45:54.763]  And our energy is being used to build this hellish thing.
[00:45:56.926 --> 00:46:05.473]  And then I see arrested development, you know, young, thuggish cops strutting around, bugging their eyes out at people, and it's just like, whoa, I don't even hate them or dislike them.
[00:46:05.473 --> 00:46:06.874]  I just, I know who they are.
[00:46:06.874 --> 00:46:08.696]  I know more about them than they do.
[00:46:08.696 --> 00:46:12.699]  I know more about them than their mama does.
[00:46:12.699 --> 00:46:14.280]  And I just look at them.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.743]  I mean, I know more about their psychology and what's been done to them.
[00:46:17.743 --> 00:46:19.464]  Because they're not the same person their mama
[00:46:20.305 --> 00:46:20.425]  to go.
[00:46:38.985 --> 00:46:39.325]  Really?
[00:46:39.325 --> 00:46:40.526]  You're that big a failure?
[00:46:40.526 --> 00:46:42.127]  And I'm not singling out the police.
[00:46:42.127 --> 00:46:43.948]  They just are where the rubber meets the road.
[00:46:43.948 --> 00:46:45.629]  It's the whole system, folks.
[00:46:45.629 --> 00:46:48.851]  It's coming down by design.
[00:46:48.851 --> 00:46:50.632]  Let's go to this congressman from Texas.
[00:46:50.632 --> 00:46:51.572]  He's been on the show before.
[00:46:51.572 --> 00:46:53.753]  He's a really good guy.
[00:46:53.753 --> 00:46:55.674]  Louie Gohmert.
[00:46:55.674 --> 00:46:59.757]  The story is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:46:59.757 --> 00:47:03.919]  It's Congressman Warren's of Obamacare Secret Security Force.
[00:47:03.919 --> 00:47:05.660]  We got two big guests coming up today.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.801]  We have a real expert
[00:47:08.173 --> 00:47:18.798]  I read about this guy before, but I heard him on the Understand Monteith Show like two nights ago while I was driving around Austin, and I've read all of Brzezinski's books.
[00:47:18.798 --> 00:47:23.461]  I've studied Trilateral Commission quarterly reports I had to send off and pay four years ago.
[00:47:23.461 --> 00:47:28.483]  I mean, I know their plan, and I was learning stuff from this guy.
[00:47:28.483 --> 00:47:31.585]  I knew everything he was saying was accurate, and then to a point,
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.347]  I went and looked up some of the stuff I didn't know and found that it was accurate.
[00:47:35.347 --> 00:47:37.934]  I mean, he's got their plan down, okay?
[00:47:37.934 --> 00:47:40.280]  This guy went to the National Archives in Canada.
[00:47:41.226 --> 00:47:42.266]  That's how you gotta do this stuff.
[00:47:42.266 --> 00:47:44.487]  You gotta send off and pay for it or go to the archives.
[00:47:44.487 --> 00:47:47.829]  Or big law libraries will have it, like UT Library has a lot of it.
[00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:49.950]  And he sat there and spent years reading it all.
[00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.631]  And man, they are going to sterilize everybody.
[00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:54.452]  They're gonna break up all our families.
[00:47:54.452 --> 00:47:56.173]  They're gonna put us in forced labor camps.
[00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.173]  I mean, that's just unbelievable.
[00:47:58.173 --> 00:48:00.875]  All Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford Foundation.
[00:48:00.875 --> 00:48:02.575]  On record, battle plan.
[00:48:02.575 --> 00:48:06.977]  I mean, on record, you could convict them all right now.
[00:48:06.977 --> 00:48:10.479]  Nuremberg trials for their plan and what they've already carried out so far.
[00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:13.018]  Joe Gohmert has come out.
[00:48:13.018 --> 00:48:17.525]  Congressman Warren's of Obamacare secret security force.
[00:48:17.525 --> 00:48:26.299]  It's a seven minute clip up on the site where he goes through what's in the legislation and then he's setting up a national security force and that's what they're doing.
[00:48:27.336 --> 00:48:40.081]  This enacts it, because it's paramilitary when you read the fine print, and then they hire former Blackwater XC types as the security force to guard the federal buildings, but they're not a security force, they're an offensive force.
[00:48:40.081 --> 00:48:41.701]  Totally outside government.
[00:48:41.701 --> 00:48:43.682]  Let's play a few minutes of this clip.
[00:48:44.355 --> 00:48:51.202]  New efforts in Wisconsin and in that area, it makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:48:51.202 --> 00:49:04.817]  So I'm just giving all this background to listeners so they can understand that hopefully they should be as skeptical of Homeland Security and the Justice Department as I think you and I are.
[00:49:05.017 --> 00:49:13.702]  Well, I agree with you, and all the things that you've mentioned we've talked about a lot on the show as well, Elabieri and all the rest that you've talked about, all very, very important things.
[00:49:13.702 --> 00:49:24.889]  But, you know, we've had a lot of people out there saying they're taking note of the 1.6 billion rounds of, in part, hollow point ammunition, which is to kill people, not for target practice.
[00:49:24.889 --> 00:49:25.790]  You've had... Right.
[00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:29.092]  Most ranges don't let you use hollow points on their range.
[00:49:29.092 --> 00:49:29.832]  Right, right.
[00:49:29.832 --> 00:49:31.073]  It's destructive of the target.
[00:49:31.073 --> 00:49:34.075]  So, that made no sense, and I have asked
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:40.564]  Folks on Homeland Security, if they're, you know, what is the reason for that?
[00:49:40.564 --> 00:49:44.547]  And I'm talking about the Committee on Homeland Security in the House.
[00:49:44.547 --> 00:49:46.649]  And they seem satisfied.
[00:49:46.649 --> 00:49:52.733]  Well, apparently, you know, they just have to get this much ammunition when they're buying for all the different departments.
[00:49:52.733 --> 00:49:55.896]  But, Janet, that does not make sense.
[00:49:55.896 --> 00:49:59.859]  And I don't have answers on what they're doing.
[00:50:02.523 --> 00:50:06.407]  We're going to come back and play the rest of it, but skip ahead because we don't have enough time to play it.
[00:50:06.407 --> 00:50:08.169]  Go to the clip where he talks about the conspiracy.
[00:50:08.169 --> 00:50:10.472]  Here's that clip.
[00:50:10.472 --> 00:50:17.339]  Christians are looking at this and saying, gee, I hope my mind isn't going in a direction that's actually seeming that it's going.
[00:50:17.339 --> 00:50:22.545]  And people don't want to think that way and seem conspiratorial, but it's odd that they will not answer questions.
[00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:43.271]  Well, but you get back to reporters, I think the reason that they're afraid to ask the tough questions about these kind of things is that they're afraid that all of their colleagues will immediately turn on them and say, oh, you're another right-wing nut, you know, you see a conspiracy everywhere.
[00:50:43.271 --> 00:50:45.232]  I don't see conspiracies everywhere.
[00:50:45.232 --> 00:50:50.275]  I just see really stupid moves being made by this administration.
[00:50:51.328 --> 00:50:52.069]  That's right.
[00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:54.252]  So, uh, what they're doing is power grabbing.
[00:50:54.252 --> 00:50:55.814]  History is repeating itself.
[00:50:55.814 --> 00:50:59.078]  The full interview, there's even more, is up on Infowars.com.
[00:50:59.078 --> 00:51:00.701]  We're gonna come back into the latest on Obamacare.
[00:51:00.701 --> 00:51:06.228]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:51:06.408 --> 00:51:13.791]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:51:13.791 --> 00:51:17.112]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:51:17.112 --> 00:51:19.132]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:51:19.132 --> 00:51:23.794]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:51:23.794 --> 00:51:26.695]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:51:26.695 --> 00:51:32.477]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:51:32.657 --> 00:51:36.339]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.

[00:52:01.294 --> 00:52:04.275]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[00:52:04.275 --> 00:52:10.658]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[00:52:10.658 --> 00:52:17.041]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:52:17.461 --> 00:52:19.743]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.

[00:54:39.264 --> 00:54:42.786]  He's going to be joining us via video Skype for TV viewers.
[00:54:42.786 --> 00:54:53.751]  You can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and see the free feeds or see them archived in high def at PrisonPlanet.tv but radio listeners will be able to tune in as well.
[00:54:53.751 --> 00:54:55.432]  That is in the second hour.
[00:54:55.432 --> 00:54:56.833]  If you want to know how things really work,
[00:54:58.192 --> 00:55:00.854]  Folks can't just decide to say, oh, that's their opinion.
[00:55:00.854 --> 00:55:06.980]  You're going to hear documentation, where they say it, when they said it, of their plan.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:16.568]  Any of you could go read Brzezinski's books, where he admits the government deals the drugs, the government runs the organized crime, the government funds communism and fascism.
[00:55:16.568 --> 00:55:23.333]  You can read Carol Quigley's book, The Head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's mentor, 1,100 pagers saying all that.
[00:55:23.333 --> 00:55:24.514]  I've read it, most of it.
[00:55:24.514 --> 00:55:25.755]  I've scanned it.
[00:55:25.755 --> 00:55:26.216]  We sell it.
[00:55:27.961 --> 00:55:29.141]  And it's just all right there.
[00:55:29.141 --> 00:55:32.342]  And, you know, you're a dumb animal and you deserve to die.
[00:55:32.342 --> 00:55:34.143]  And he publishes books saying that.
[00:55:34.143 --> 00:55:35.343]  And he runs things.
[00:55:35.343 --> 00:55:56.430]  So, you know, I was told by an insider yesterday about making a film about a billionaire, and he was working on the film, and the billionaire, well-known billionaire, was at a big sports team event that he owns, and was actually talking with some other billionaires about, yeah, the slaves
[00:55:57.307 --> 00:55:59.628]  Don't need to, you know, know that we're doing this to control them.
[00:55:59.628 --> 00:56:03.248]  It always be about how we have the high ground and we're here to protect them.
[00:56:03.248 --> 00:56:05.369]  And we're here to do all this for their safety.
[00:56:05.369 --> 00:56:07.169]  We're going to, this is like five years ago.
[00:56:07.169 --> 00:56:13.691]  We're going to put chips in all of the medicines and things to make sure they're taking them so we can control them.
[00:56:13.691 --> 00:56:16.511]  We're going to have retina scanners everywhere for them to buy and sell.
[00:56:16.511 --> 00:56:19.692]  And we're going to have a total police state in place for their own good.
[00:56:19.692 --> 00:56:24.733]  And then he would sit there laughing about everybody.
[00:56:28.362 --> 00:56:30.964]  And I've been around this kind of stuff, folks.
[00:56:30.964 --> 00:56:35.928]  I mean, this is a predatory, conscious plan against you and your family.
[00:56:35.928 --> 00:56:40.351]  And the sooner you figure that out, the better.
[00:56:40.351 --> 00:56:57.143]  Then I was talking to another insider, who'd multiple times been around a bunch of Masons, and how they would just talk so much trash about me, when George Washington, the Mason, would literally spit on you.
[00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:01.431]  I mean, I'm not saying all Masons are evil.
[00:57:01.431 --> 00:57:03.793]  I'm not saying all branches of it go back to something bad.
[00:57:03.793 --> 00:57:05.315]  I know the real history of it.
[00:57:05.315 --> 00:57:10.539]  I've forgotten more about Masonry than most Masons know.
[00:57:10.539 --> 00:57:12.901]  It's all right there in the history books.
[00:57:12.901 --> 00:57:14.903]  I've had a lot of family that were high-level Masons.
[00:57:14.903 --> 00:57:16.084]  I don't hide that fact.
[00:57:16.084 --> 00:57:17.265]  And you know what they told my dad?
[00:57:17.265 --> 00:57:19.306]  You know what they told me?
[00:57:19.306 --> 00:57:22.048]  Don't ever be a Mason when you get asked.
[00:57:22.048 --> 00:57:23.990]  Don't ever be part of it.
[00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.811]  Is that understood?
[00:57:25.888 --> 00:57:28.749]  I've had family that have been 33rd degree masons.
[00:57:28.749 --> 00:57:30.610]  What do you think they discovered?
[00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:36.492]  I've got family on both sides involved in the founding of Texas.
[00:57:36.492 --> 00:57:40.633]  Lone Star State, you think I know about masons?
[00:57:40.633 --> 00:57:44.415]  You know how many family aprons I've got in storage?
[00:57:44.415 --> 00:57:45.155]  Or my dad does?
[00:57:49.298 --> 00:57:55.480]  The point is, is that what Masonry is today is something promoting the New World Order.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.662]  You guys aren't doing anything to stop tyranny.
[00:57:58.662 --> 00:58:02.323]  So, you want to talk about how I'm bad and I'm making all this stuff up?
[00:58:02.323 --> 00:58:06.105]  I'm not making any of this up.
[00:58:06.105 --> 00:58:07.845]  None of it.
[00:58:07.845 --> 00:58:10.466]  None of it.
[00:58:10.466 --> 00:58:11.567]  You hear that, Masons?
[00:58:11.567 --> 00:58:14.808]  I want to have a show someday where for three hours I let the Masons call in.
[00:58:17.915 --> 00:58:22.578]  And I will quiz them to see if they really are Masons.
[00:58:22.578 --> 00:58:26.981]  And just tell me how I'm wrong about all this stuff.
[00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:28.642]  Let me ask Mason something.
[00:58:28.642 --> 00:58:32.305]  Would George Washington like what you do, what you stand for?
[00:58:32.305 --> 00:58:38.129]  You're all a bunch of nobodies on power trips because you're part of an organization that was taken over a long time ago.
[00:58:38.129 --> 00:58:47.215]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.144 --> 00:58:56.605]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:58:56.605 --> 00:59:05.508]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:13.330]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:20.732]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:59:21.232 --> 00:59:25.195]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:59:25.195 --> 00:59:29.379]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:59:29.379 --> 00:59:36.525]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[00:59:36.525 --> 00:59:43.750]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front.
[00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:47.794]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:59:53.536 --> 00:59:55.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.685]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:10.182]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.182 --> 01:00:11.762]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.762 --> 01:00:13.323]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:17.505]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.505 --> 01:00:21.568]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.348 --> 01:00:37.073]  To fix Obamacare, Congress will have to stand down and allow Obama to operate outside of the courts, outside of law, outside of Congress.
[01:00:37.073 --> 01:00:39.694]  And of course, this is the big test now, because the Republican leadership
[01:00:40.626 --> 01:00:44.188]  You know, help write this with foreign banks, so they want it to go through.
[01:00:44.188 --> 01:00:45.628]  That's their orders.
[01:00:45.628 --> 01:00:51.972]  And so now, Obama will be like, hey, let me do what I want outside of law, and I'll give you the free health care.
[01:00:51.972 --> 01:00:54.013]  And then, of course, you'll let him be dictator.
[01:00:54.013 --> 01:00:59.535]  It'll get even worse, as I keep telling you, for years and months, specifically.
[01:00:59.535 --> 01:01:01.396]  And then it'll just get worse and worse and worse.
[01:01:01.396 --> 01:01:06.879]  It's kind of like if you stuck your arm in something and something bit your finger off, you wouldn't stick your arm back in there.
[01:01:06.879 --> 01:01:08.980]  So you stick your arm in the Obamacare hole,
[01:01:10.407 --> 01:01:14.111]  And you pull it out and three fingers are been chewed off.
[01:01:14.111 --> 01:01:17.794]  And you hear a voice going, I love you, stick your hand back in.
[01:01:17.794 --> 01:01:20.657]  I'll give you a bag of gold if you stick your hand back in.
[01:01:20.657 --> 01:01:22.799]  You know, come to healthcare.gov.
[01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:23.639]  Oh, I love you.
[01:01:23.639 --> 01:01:24.140]  I love you.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:24.600]  I love you.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.482]  And you go, well, it sounds sweet.
[01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:33.549]  You know, it sounds like Harry Lennox, who now has gone public to media in, um,
[01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:39.228]  Chicago, that he actually for years was there and trained Obama.
[01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:43.829]  And then you watch and listen to Lennox, and you go back to videos of him years ago, he's Obama!
[01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:51.272]  He's the guy, he's the American, he's the smooth-talking guy, the Shakespearean actor, who trained Obozo.
[01:01:52.572 --> 01:01:54.013]  I mean, we know Obama.
[01:01:54.013 --> 01:01:56.274]  I shouldn't call him a bozo, but I like to denigrate their puppets.
[01:01:56.274 --> 01:02:03.417]  He's actually a viciously successful puppet who savagely stabbed America in the back a thousand times and we're bleeding out right now.
[01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:08.499]  So he's actually the Great Destroyer, the most successful New World Order agent ever against the Republic.
[01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:19.504]  Benedict Arnold rolls in his grave with jealousy, flopping end over end, foaming at the mouth with just absolute rapine.
[01:02:19.504 --> 01:02:22.505]  Let's get into some of the Obozo care news.
[01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.807]  They're now reporting that the fix could make it worse.
[01:02:25.807 --> 01:02:27.908]  That's what McClatchy's saying, of course.
[01:02:27.908 --> 01:02:29.148]  Always going to make it worse.
[01:02:29.148 --> 01:02:31.569]  That's the plan.
[01:02:31.569 --> 01:02:36.992]  More Navigators exposed in new video with the Veritas Project.
[01:02:38.284 --> 01:02:46.909]  Where they're telling them to engage in fraud and cheat everyone and lie on everything and commit felonies and that they work for the Democratic Party and that they're going to take over the country.
[01:02:46.909 --> 01:02:51.531]  And no mainstream media is picking that up because, again, this is the age of total criminality.
[01:02:51.531 --> 01:02:57.314]  GOP warns of constitutional crisis, but they're controlled at the top, so don't expect anything.
[01:02:57.314 --> 01:03:00.336]  A Democratic representative says they haven't seen this much panic since 9-11.
[01:03:00.336 --> 01:03:02.557]  Yeah, that was a staged event, too.
[01:03:03.892 --> 01:03:07.275]  And the New York Times says there's a crisis in confidence in Obozo.
[01:03:07.275 --> 01:03:09.837]  Well, it doesn't matter, he's not facing re-election.
[01:03:09.837 --> 01:03:15.141]  So he's designed the abomination, the O-Vomit.
[01:03:15.141 --> 01:03:20.045]  That's the best name, because they're vomiting out their hatred on us with Obama.
[01:03:20.045 --> 01:03:22.867]  Like boiling oil dumped off a castle wall on our heads.
[01:03:25.626 --> 01:03:27.447]  We're saying it's a crisis in confidence.
[01:03:27.447 --> 01:03:36.089]  And then that will run everyone to the self-propelled Baron Harkinen, Jabba the Hutt's illegitimate son, the governor of New Jersey.
[01:03:36.089 --> 01:03:41.031]  That will run everyone to him and his suspensor belts.
[01:03:41.031 --> 01:03:52.955]  And then of course he'll come in and double down the savagery and all the neocon talk show hustle will defend him and say you're liberal if you don't like him and that I'm a commie because I don't like Christie.
[01:03:54.508 --> 01:03:55.328]  All the rest of it.
[01:03:55.328 --> 01:03:57.189]  I mean, this is how they operate.
[01:03:57.189 --> 01:03:58.950]  This is how the game works.
[01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:04.593]  And if America puts up with this again, I know there's electronic voting machines and a lot of fraud, but it doesn't matter.
[01:04:04.593 --> 01:04:20.140]  We should be out in the streets by the millions, demanding the resignation of the abomination, vomitus, maximus, ludus, brutus, ternus,
[01:04:21.684 --> 01:04:30.444]  I mean, I'm just trying to come up with names in Latin here, a little bit of pig Latin here, to describe what they're doing to us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:31.462 --> 01:04:34.863]  But, uh, I gotta have some gallows humor sometimes.
[01:04:34.863 --> 01:04:36.963]  I'm having really trouble dealing with this.
[01:04:36.963 --> 01:04:42.325]  Just watching the total criminal takeover and them dancing around on the grave of America, shutting everything down.
[01:04:42.325 --> 01:04:44.805]  Restaurants I used to go to are shut down or half empty.
[01:04:44.805 --> 01:04:46.186]  Movie theaters are empty.
[01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:47.206]  Autonomy's imploding.
[01:04:47.206 --> 01:04:56.448]  I live in the best city in the country and I can see the rot setting in everywhere while globalists fly around above me going to the F1 race this weekend that taxpayers paid for.
[01:04:56.448 --> 01:04:59.709]  These billionaires suck me dry, giggling at me.
[01:05:00.515 --> 01:05:05.241]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:05:05.241 --> 01:05:08.365]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:05:08.365 --> 01:05:13.932]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:05:13.932 --> 01:05:15.534]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:05:15.854 --> 01:05:17.495]  We are what we eat.
[01:05:17.495 --> 01:05:22.158]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:05:22.158 --> 01:05:26.381]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:28.943]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:05:28.943 --> 01:05:35.167]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:06:49.048 --> 01:07:03.234]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:07:03.234 --> 01:07:08.237]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:07:08.237 --> 01:07:15.420]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:21.181]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:07:21.181 --> 01:07:25.202]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:07:45.907 --> 01:07:48.788]  Hand cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:07:48.788 --> 01:07:55.989]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our Info War possible.
[01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.270]  We're getting prepared.
[01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.930]  Are you?
[01:07:57.930 --> 01:07:59.010]  InfoWarshop.com.
[01:08:05.472 --> 01:08:10.315]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.315 --> 01:08:11.896]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.896 --> 01:08:13.437]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:17.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.702]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:38.772 --> 01:08:43.675]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition.
[01:08:43.675 --> 01:08:45.136]  We are now into the second hour.
[01:08:45.136 --> 01:08:59.084]  We have a guest that we're getting hooked up on Skype right now who's an expert on the technotronic technocracy age, the governing system that the globalists actually describe themselves as being adherents of.
[01:08:59.744 --> 01:09:04.569]  And this is a system they're trying to set up, so that's coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:11.756]  First off, Congressman McDermott is saying he hasn't seen this much panic on the floor since 9-11.
[01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:17.881]  House Democrat compares congressional panic over Obamacare to worst terror attack in nation's history.
[01:09:18.502 --> 01:09:24.229]  Well yeah, that manufactured globalist event killed 3,000 people and was tragic.
[01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:27.393]  And then thousands more from the deadly dust the government lied about.
[01:09:27.393 --> 01:09:35.744]  But this is going to kill the economy and the engine of prosperity and kill millions through death panels and ration care on record.
[01:09:37.637 --> 01:09:41.839]  I mean, we knew what was in the bill, we knew the plan, and now get ready.
[01:09:41.839 --> 01:09:44.780]  Get ready to become impoverished.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:56.785]  Because they want you impoverished under Cloward and Piven to give up on the free market, blame capitalism for crony fraud capitalism that they brought in, where they socialize our lives, but then transfer the wealth to themselves.
[01:09:58.433 --> 01:10:01.114]  So, that is just some of the news.
[01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:09.039]  Also, CBS is reporting that a TSA agent officer bled for 33 minutes in an LAX shooting.
[01:10:09.039 --> 01:10:13.881]  Airports are supposed to be the most secure places in the country, except for, like, military bases.
[01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:18.704]  And then this guy bled for 33 minutes while they got the SWAT team all suited up and ready.
[01:10:18.704 --> 01:10:26.888]  Again, it's the culture of just worrying about their safety all day, until the point is nobody's safe because a nanny state can do nothing but make you domesticated.
[01:10:28.573 --> 01:10:40.482]  A nanny state can do nothing except basically turn you into a sheep.
[01:10:40.482 --> 01:10:42.764]  It's so simple.
[01:10:42.764 --> 01:10:48.208]  And then we've got the other news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:52.491]  Reports out Obama is an actor trained by Harry Lennox.
[01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:54.032]  This is a big deal if this goes viral.
[01:10:55.182 --> 01:11:11.094]  That Harry Lennox is saying, and it's on record they were friends for about 17 years, and that they had done work together and they'd go to each other's houses and now he reportedly says Obama's horrible and is a rat.
[01:11:11.094 --> 01:11:12.715]  That's another quote.
[01:11:12.715 --> 01:11:14.677]  A rat.
[01:11:14.677 --> 01:11:20.581]  And that Obama was trained by him to be presidential.
[01:11:20.581 --> 01:11:21.562]  And then of course if you watch
[01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:24.835]  Uh, Harry Lennox to an interview, it's Obama.
[01:11:24.835 --> 01:11:26.397]  The same cadence, the same voice.
[01:11:28.604 --> 01:11:32.826]  Obama is copying Lennox, or Lennox is copying Obama.
[01:11:32.826 --> 01:11:34.387]  It's like the same guy.
[01:11:34.387 --> 01:11:42.452]  And I believe Lennox over Obama, so that article and the source on that is up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:11:42.452 --> 01:11:46.774]  Also, again, the Federal Reserve is planning to accelerate money printing.
[01:11:46.774 --> 01:11:53.658]  Congressman warns of Obama creating secret security force, armed security force, that's actually in the Obamacare bill.
[01:11:54.358 --> 01:11:57.041]  And then the media is like, oh, he would never do that.
[01:11:57.041 --> 01:12:03.008]  They've already set it up with mercenaries with top security clearances guarding federal buildings now.
[01:12:03.008 --> 01:12:05.631]  And then the billions of bullets and all the training and the rest of it.
[01:12:05.631 --> 01:12:08.754]  I mean, this is just simply, simply amazing.
[01:12:09.639 --> 01:12:11.842]  And then some of the other news.
[01:12:11.842 --> 01:12:13.565]  Countdown U.S.
[01:12:13.565 --> 01:12:17.270]  hits debt ceiling in 84 days.
[01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:20.374]  And again, Obama said raising the debt does not raise the debt.
[01:12:20.374 --> 01:12:21.877]  Only not raising it.
[01:12:21.877 --> 01:12:26.043]  That's the only thing that is financially irresponsible.
[01:12:27.967 --> 01:12:30.950]  We have a bigger debt than we have yearly GDP.
[01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:37.556]  We have a higher debt-to-savings ratio than Spain and Greece that are both completely bankrupt.
[01:12:37.556 --> 01:12:39.498]  And their answer is, get us deeper into debt.
[01:12:39.498 --> 01:12:40.038]  Why not?
[01:12:40.038 --> 01:12:42.680]  The globalists want us impoverished.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.084]  And if Rand Paul wants to cut the defense budget, he's a traitor.
[01:12:47.179 --> 01:12:55.445]  And if Ted Cruz wants to cut some of the corporate welfare and entitlement welfare, oh, he's a horrible person.
[01:12:55.445 --> 01:13:03.331]  You can't continue to do this and have 101 million people on food assistance and 100 plus million people on government dole.
[01:13:03.331 --> 01:13:06.434]  There's more people on the dole now than in the workforce.
[01:13:06.434 --> 01:13:07.995]  Let me say that again.
[01:13:07.995 --> 01:13:11.077]  What about the people going bankrupt everywhere?
[01:13:11.077 --> 01:13:12.959]  What about the people losing their houses?
[01:13:14.226 --> 01:13:18.647]  Well, the folks that have been not working for five, ten years, they go, I don't care!
[01:13:18.647 --> 01:13:19.587]  Tax the rich!
[01:13:19.587 --> 01:13:25.568]  It's the ultra-rich lobbying for that, against the middle class, their historic enemy, to bankrupt the country.
[01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:29.389]  Once they've done that, you're all going to have your welfare taken away.
[01:13:29.389 --> 01:13:33.270]  Here's an article, China to ease one-child policy.
[01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:43.212]  That's because it's caused such a problem, having upwards of, what is it, 60, 70 more million men than they have women.
[01:13:44.491 --> 01:13:53.258]  And it's causing all sorts of societal problems, and India's about to outstrip them in population, and they've ended the labor camps.
[01:13:53.258 --> 01:13:55.320]  That's being reported by Reuters.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:00.805]  China unveils boldest reforms in decades, shows that the new president is in command.
[01:14:00.805 --> 01:14:05.108]  Folks, they don't need labor camps anymore, because they call them jobs.
[01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:12.655]  And you go in their suicide nets, and they forced drug you and forced abortion, and you're basically locked up at night, and they just don't call it labor camps.
[01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:21.861]  And don't worry, China is now on the UN Human Rights Board, deciding what's human rights, along with Cuba.
[01:14:21.861 --> 01:14:24.423]  Along with Cuba, it only gets better.
[01:14:24.423 --> 01:14:29.487]  Saudi Arabia is probably a bigger tyranny than China, per capita.
[01:14:29.487 --> 01:14:35.671]  The only thing worse is North Korea, and I expect them to be made, you know, the head of the UN operation.
[01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:41.155]  So, that's just some of the news, up on InfoWars.com, up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:14:41.155 --> 01:14:44.318]  EPA blocks cities from installing fire hydrants.
[01:14:45.871 --> 01:14:49.576]  Again, the EPA is shutting down over 500 power plants.
[01:14:49.576 --> 01:15:02.914]  Bloomberg reports Philadelphia has 119 fire hydrants that cost about $2,000 each waiting in a warehouse to be installed, yet they sit there in dry dock because federal regulators say their fittings might taint drinking water with lead.
[01:15:03.815 --> 01:15:16.622]  Yeah, the last lead smelting plant in the US, it's a very important metal for a lot of industrial uses, it's been shut down, so you can't even get bullets, but they allow lead in the food from China, just no lead in food produced here.
[01:15:17.728 --> 01:15:20.491]  And I'm talking microscopic amounts you can't have here.
[01:15:20.491 --> 01:15:23.033]  You can just ship it in at thousands of times that.
[01:15:23.033 --> 01:15:26.676]  Again, everything is meant to shut us down.
[01:15:26.676 --> 01:15:28.258]  Shut us down.
[01:15:28.258 --> 01:15:29.439]  Shut America down.
[01:15:29.439 --> 01:15:31.321]  Because remember, the globalists, they're all above the law.
[01:15:31.321 --> 01:15:32.462]  They're all exempt.
[01:15:32.462 --> 01:15:34.204]  This is what their neo-feudalism is.
[01:15:34.884 --> 01:15:38.385]  Under a technological tyranny, a technocracy.
[01:15:38.385 --> 01:15:43.127]  And that leads us now to our guest who will be with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:15:43.127 --> 01:15:47.229]  And then the top former Secret Service agent.
[01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:51.591]  He was the head of operations when the president would go overseas.
[01:15:51.591 --> 01:15:53.111]  Dan Bongino is going to join us.
[01:15:53.111 --> 01:15:56.753]  A lot of key intel at the start of the next hour.
[01:15:56.753 --> 01:15:59.834]  And then we'll take phone calls the last 30 minutes or so, I promise.
[01:15:59.834 --> 01:16:02.555]  But Patrick Wood, I was familiar with his writings and work.
[01:16:03.868 --> 01:16:31.155]  From newsreviews.com and other places, but I heard him for an hour on Dr. Stan Monteith a few nights ago, and I've read the Technotronic Age, I've read the Anglo-American Establishment, I've read Quigley's books, I've read Brzezinski's books, I read Council on Foreign Relations publications, and so I knew everything he was saying was accurate, but he knew stuff I didn't know and I went and looked it up and it was accurate.
[01:16:31.155 --> 01:16:32.355]  So I wanted to get him on because
[01:16:34.279 --> 01:16:39.063]  He is an editor of a weekly financial analysis service, Findings and Forecast.
[01:16:39.063 --> 01:16:49.514]  He has studied elite globalization policies, which you need to do to understand economics, since the late 70s when he partnered with the late Anthony C. Sutton, who was a listener and been on the show.
[01:16:50.054 --> 01:16:53.918]  He co-authored Trilaterals Over Washington Volumes 1 and 2.
[01:16:53.918 --> 01:17:02.227]  He remains a leading expert on the Elitist Trilateral Commission, their policies and achievements in creating their self-proclaimed new international economic order.
[01:17:02.227 --> 01:17:08.774]  He is also a leading expert on historic and modern technocracy, which plays a prominent role in current world affairs.
[01:17:08.774 --> 01:17:11.657]  That says it lightly.
[01:17:13.412 --> 01:17:21.821]  An economist by education, a financial analyst, and writer by profession, an American constitutionalist by choice, Wood holds a biblical worldview.
[01:17:21.821 --> 01:17:27.767]  He has a deep historical insight into the modern attacks on sovereignty, property rights, and personal freedom.
[01:17:27.767 --> 01:17:29.569]  Such attacks are the epitome.
[01:17:30.843 --> 01:17:40.738]  Uh, and, uh, by the implementation of UN policies, such as Gen 21, sustainable development, smart growth, and in education, the widespread adoption of Common Core, 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:17:40.738 --> 01:17:46.026]  His current research builds on Terlateral Commission hegemony involving transhumanism, technocracy,
[01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:53.813]  And more, and how these are co-opting economics, politics, and religion, which together represent the major pillars of society.
[01:17:53.813 --> 01:17:59.458]  Yes, they're taking over all sciences, philosophies, and re-engineering them, and I appreciate them coming on.
[01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:01.540]  We're going to skip this network break because I'm behind.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:05.403]  This is such important intelligence, so stations shouldn't be skipping this break.
[01:18:05.403 --> 01:18:06.684]  It's a network break.
[01:18:06.684 --> 01:18:09.686]  We're going to do this because it's time, it's important.
[01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:14.727]  Augustforecast.com is his site, and he will be here frequently.
[01:18:14.727 --> 01:18:20.228]  There's so many amazing minds out there that we just, you know, just tend to forget in our rush.
[01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:34.812]  And Anthony Sutton, of course, advised Congress, discovered all the documents at the Ford Foundation and others, with Patrick Wood, who was a top congressional advisor, on the plan to convert America to a tyranny, how our government funded Stalin, Lenin before him.
[01:18:34.812 --> 01:18:40.533]  Hitler didn't run them or control them, built them, just like Saddam and Al-Qaeda and all of it.
[01:18:41.693 --> 01:18:50.137]  And to understand the scientific tyranny, the application of dehumanization, we give you probably one of the greatest living experts.
[01:18:50.137 --> 01:18:54.118]  Because I went and looked into him, and I'd seen his writings, and I was like, I forgot about Patrick Wood.
[01:18:54.118 --> 01:18:55.359]  Why has he never been on the show?
[01:18:55.359 --> 01:18:58.240]  He might have been on, I might have forgot, but I don't believe he's ever been with us.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.441]  And it's just so important, a treasure trove.
[01:19:00.441 --> 01:19:04.002]  The reason I'm building this up is, you need to understand, this is your world.
[01:19:04.002 --> 01:19:05.083]  This is how it really runs.
[01:19:05.703 --> 01:19:14.828]  These are the guys that in Congress got the documents and went to the Canadian archives and got the intel to put out the intel and to post the documents on their websites.
[01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:22.365]  I had Sutton on about 17 years ago, and then I tried to get him on a few years later, and he said, I'm sorry, I'm too ill, but I appreciate your work.
[01:19:22.365 --> 01:19:23.786]  And then he died like a week later.
[01:19:23.786 --> 01:19:26.788]  I couldn't believe he was like on his deathbed and was sending me emails back.
[01:19:26.788 --> 01:19:29.250]  So I just really admire his work as well.
[01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:31.651]  And we need to remember these men that have fought so hard.
[01:19:31.651 --> 01:19:38.816]  Mr. Wood, I know it's probably annoying having me gush over you, but your intel is so vital to the preservation of human dignity.
[01:19:39.929 --> 01:19:41.011]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:19:41.011 --> 01:19:44.638]  I appreciate the opportunity to get some of this information out.
[01:19:44.638 --> 01:19:51.530]  I've been trying hard, as you know, and I always enjoy doing radio and TV interviews whenever I can.
[01:19:52.247 --> 01:19:52.908]  Well, let's do this.
[01:19:52.908 --> 01:19:55.190]  Let's say you're talking to a new audience.
[01:19:55.190 --> 01:20:03.398]  If you had five minutes on national TV, which this basically is now, three million people right now conservatively watching and listening, how would you introduce it to laymen?
[01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:09.384]  Because my listeners are very smart, very informed, but they always want to give stuff to their family.
[01:20:09.384 --> 01:20:10.946]  And so they want it crystallized.
[01:20:10.946 --> 01:20:15.491]  Give us the basic overview and then get into the nuts and bolts of technocracy.
[01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:24.198]  Well, you know it's a complex and a deep topic, but basically the first idea is this.
[01:20:24.198 --> 01:20:31.526]  The problems we've been having in the last 35 to 40 years especially have been economic in nature rather than political.
[01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:38.633]  And there's a lot of emphasis in the public, like in the Tea Parties, the conservative movement, and even in liberal circles as well.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:49.244]  That the world revolves around politics, that is, arguing in Congress and fighting with the executive branch and so on.
[01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:55.606]  My studies on the Trilateral Commission have pretty much pointed out, I think with great detail, that
[01:20:56.471 --> 01:21:08.035]  The takeover of America has been economic in nature, and that was the nature originally of the Trilateral Commission that was formed in 1973 by David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:14.098]  They said frequently that they were going to create a new international economic order.
[01:21:14.098 --> 01:21:17.099]  They used that in every one of their early publications.
[01:21:18.232 --> 01:21:24.374]  We didn't really know at the time exactly what that would look like, but we had a pretty good idea from reading the policies.
[01:21:24.374 --> 01:21:33.677]  And they have managed over a period of now since 1973, some 35 plus years, to create this new international economic order.
[01:21:33.677 --> 01:21:36.138]  And if we look around, this is what we see today, Alex.
[01:21:36.138 --> 01:21:38.179]  This is what's important to realize.
[01:21:38.179 --> 01:21:41.340]  Back then, people criticized us for being conspiracy nuts.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:48.561]  Today, we have the force of history behind us, which after a 25-year period, of course, becomes history.
[01:21:48.561 --> 01:21:54.002]  We can now look back at history and see that what we said in the 1970s was exactly right.
[01:21:54.002 --> 01:21:56.063]  This is exactly what they've done.
[01:21:56.063 --> 01:22:01.804]  We know that the world system today is broken, almost beyond repair.
[01:22:01.804 --> 01:22:06.005]  And we have to put the finger where the finger belongs.
[01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:11.286]  And it belongs with this very small elite group of internationalists
[01:22:12.216 --> 01:22:18.181]  That were represented by the members of the Trilateral Commission back in 1973 and ever since, I might add.
[01:22:18.181 --> 01:22:22.845]  And they have influenced our government, our executive branch of our government especially.
[01:22:22.845 --> 01:22:25.127]  They have influenced our government.
[01:22:26.196 --> 01:22:27.057]  I don't
[01:22:45.453 --> 01:22:53.939]  The political system was really just a useful idiot for this elite group of economy changers, if you will.
[01:22:53.939 --> 01:23:01.224]  They had to use the political system to get what they wanted to do economically over these last years.
[01:23:01.224 --> 01:23:05.787]  And so we see things like the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:06.527]  That's good.
[01:23:26.639 --> 01:23:31.820]  Has continued from 1973 to today.
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.480]  Hasn't let up.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.881]  Nobody has identified these people behind the scenes.
[01:23:36.881 --> 01:23:42.542]  Nobody has even politicians will not write about them or speak about them.
[01:23:42.542 --> 01:23:54.444]  In fact, I think the only living politician living or dead that I know that ever talked about the Trilateral Commission was Barry Goldwater when he wrote his memoirs with no apologies back in 1979.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.061]  Um, so this group was not talked about.
[01:23:59.061 --> 01:24:00.562]  These people are not talked about.
[01:24:00.562 --> 01:24:07.946]  We've been writing about him since 19, well, 1977, really, and nothing has changed.
[01:24:07.946 --> 01:24:11.928]  You know, they're doing the same thing today they did back then.
[01:24:11.928 --> 01:24:14.870]  I don't know how else I could summarize it in a very short period of time, Alex.
[01:24:15.489 --> 01:24:16.430]  Well, you've done a great job.
[01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:23.257]  In fact, I'm going to pull up the Barry Goldwater quote, with no apologies, where he describes how it's an economic takeover.
[01:24:23.257 --> 01:24:26.781]  We're designed to fight a Stalin, a Hitler, a Mao.
[01:24:26.781 --> 01:24:28.543]  We see a foreign enemy.
[01:24:28.543 --> 01:24:35.710]  But when it's corporate and regulatory and incremental, and it creates a global group of less than 100 corporations, in Rockefeller's own words,
[01:24:36.751 --> 01:24:39.913]  He's written New York Times articles bragging about it.
[01:24:39.913 --> 01:24:44.295]  How they want centralized control and how they divide up the world.
[01:24:44.295 --> 01:24:44.656]  U.S.
[01:24:44.656 --> 01:24:47.517]  based companies get the toll roads in Spain.
[01:24:47.517 --> 01:24:50.679]  Spain gets the toll roads over here.
[01:24:50.679 --> 01:25:00.985]  It's where they divide up the world amongst themselves and then bring in a technocracy to be able to control the population scientifically where it's impossible
[01:25:01.385 --> 01:25:04.989]  To ever get out of it or even know what you're in, and you've dumbed down the population.
[01:25:04.989 --> 01:25:10.334]  So I want to walk down, walk through what technocracy and the technotronic age is, what they're doing with it.
[01:25:10.334 --> 01:25:13.116]  Because, I mean, as best I understand it, it is the...
[01:25:14.341 --> 01:25:23.289]  It is the Cecil Rhodes plan of 1900 and the British royalty and their empire that was in trouble.
[01:25:23.289 --> 01:25:31.455]  They said, we'll go corporate, take down our flag, but use corporate energy to still control these holdings that we once had, like India and other places.
[01:25:32.396 --> 01:25:39.160]  And at the same time, we'll export this corporate plan and team up with other robber barons in the United States and Europe.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.121]  That's what Bilderberg later became.
[01:25:41.121 --> 01:25:46.864]  But their philosophy comes out of eugenics and Malthus and Galton.
[01:25:46.864 --> 01:25:53.388]  And so it's basically eugenics scientifically deployed through a world government corporate
[01:25:54.209 --> 01:25:54.770]  I don't know.
[01:26:05.993 --> 01:26:06.933]  is international.
[01:26:06.933 --> 01:26:19.198]  Again, the Trilateral Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[01:26:19.198 --> 01:26:31.382]  The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical, the churches, from no apologies.
[01:26:31.382 --> 01:26:34.023]  Now, let me break this down for folks and give you the floor.
[01:26:35.265 --> 01:26:55.841]  America was pretty much the sole superpower by the end of World War II, so the globalists had to create a fake bipolar world by giving weapons to the Soviets to then build them up to let us become a tyranny and then share in a backdoor globalist deal taking over different areas of the world in the name of fighting each other.
[01:26:56.321 --> 01:26:57.982]  In full spectrum dominance.
[01:26:57.982 --> 01:27:05.244]  Then, they ended that farce, and then moved on to the new Al-Qaeda threat, which they actually ran, to use that to take our liberties.
[01:27:05.244 --> 01:27:20.488]  So I'm basically describing the main trait of technocracy is that it's totally amoral, except for the eugenics-based system, that it doesn't even, it uses everything, as Carol quickly said, socialism, fascism, communism, as long as it's command and control.
[01:27:20.488 --> 01:27:20.928]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:27:21.889 --> 01:27:32.177]  Well, the book Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, we refer to it in pretty much everywhere people talk about, oh, it's a brave new world.
[01:27:32.177 --> 01:27:43.926]  That book was written in 1932, Alex, and it was written by Aldous Huxley looking straight into the face of technocracy that was a big movement back then.
[01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:49.230]  I didn't discover the technocracy movement from the 1930s until a few years ago.
[01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:50.170]  I think?
[01:28:10.214 --> 01:28:18.481]  But these technocrats specified very carefully what they would do if they could replace capitalism.
[01:28:18.481 --> 01:28:21.664]  They believed in the Great Depression that capitalism was dead.
[01:28:21.664 --> 01:28:24.307]  Unemployment lines were, you know, wrapping around blocks.
[01:28:24.307 --> 01:28:28.510]  Soup kitchens were, you know, just serving people all day long.
[01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:35.757]  And they believed that they could provide an economic system that would be better than capitalism.
[01:28:36.397 --> 01:28:37.478]  It didn't get very far.
[01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:42.381]  It kind of died out as a movement around 1938 to 40.
[01:28:42.381 --> 01:28:47.864]  But today, it's had a resurgence, if you will.
[01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:51.246]  Sure, it's been adopted as the globalist management program.
[01:28:51.246 --> 01:28:54.447]  It has now been adopted by the globalist management program.
[01:28:54.447 --> 01:28:57.869]  And the reason I say this is important, we follow the money.
[01:28:57.869 --> 01:29:05.174]  Back in the 1930s, the Rockefeller and Carnegie crowd were dumping buckets of money onto the eugenics movement.
[01:29:06.119 --> 01:29:08.321]  This is well known and well documented.
[01:29:08.321 --> 01:29:12.864]  They did not dump any money on the technocracy movement back then.
[01:29:12.864 --> 01:29:17.707]  And so the technocracy movement kind of withered and died after a period of time.
[01:29:17.707 --> 01:29:31.576]  However, when Zbigniew Brzezinski resuscitated those ideas in 1970 with his book called Between Two Ages, America's Role in the Technocratic Era, that apparently caught
[01:29:32.375 --> 01:29:35.236]  Rockefeller's I. That's right, Patrick Woods.
[01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:36.057]  Stay there.
[01:29:36.057 --> 01:29:40.258]  We'll explain who David Rockefeller is, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and more.
[01:29:40.258 --> 01:29:45.920]  These two men, you can say more than anybody now, literally govern our civilization.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:50.102]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.102 --> 01:29:51.483]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.483 --> 01:29:54.004]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.004 --> 01:29:56.685]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:11.378]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:30:11.378 --> 01:30:13.439]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:30:13.439 --> 01:30:14.320]  Fluoride.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.241]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:30:16.241 --> 01:30:22.826]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:30:22.826 --> 01:30:27.749]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:30:27.749 --> 01:30:29.430]  Reports documented of 15-point IQ
[01:30:30.771 --> 01:30:31.291]  We're good.
[01:31:00.683 --> 01:31:07.908]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:31:07.908 --> 01:31:25.800]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.923]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:31:30.183 --> 01:31:31.944]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:31:31.944 --> 01:31:40.110]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:46.434]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:47.715]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:31:47.715 --> 01:31:48.575]  It's incredible.
[01:31:48.575 --> 01:31:57.802]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:31:57.802 --> 01:31:59.963]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:32:00.463 --> 01:32:03.946]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:32:03.946 --> 01:32:09.891]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:16.476]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:32:16.476 --> 01:32:22.181]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:32:22.181 --> 01:32:25.824]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:32:26.004 --> 01:32:29.787]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:32:29.787 --> 01:32:34.392]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:32:34.392 --> 01:32:36.914]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:32:36.914 --> 01:32:40.757]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:32:40.757 --> 01:32:45.181]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:32:45.181 --> 01:32:47.844]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:32:48.124 --> 01:32:54.973]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:32:54.973 --> 01:32:59.219]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:33:11.799 --> 01:33:12.940]  Big Brother.
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:14.721]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:14.721 --> 01:33:16.622]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:16.622 --> 01:33:18.304]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:18.304 --> 01:33:19.985]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:19.985 --> 01:33:24.689]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.019 --> 01:33:45.507]  We're going back to our guest, and I'm really going to try to give him the floor to break down the history of this, but you hear me start almost hyperventilating when he's talking about it, because I've done the research.
[01:33:45.507 --> 01:33:46.908]  I know it's true.
[01:33:46.908 --> 01:33:50.051]  I watched David Rockefeller on C-SPAN 50-something times.
[01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:51.732]  I read their publications.
[01:33:51.732 --> 01:34:02.281]  I know out of over 70 globalist organizations set up since the 30s, he set up almost all of them, or his dad did, and he's like the omnibudsman
[01:34:03.486 --> 01:34:13.756]  Of just all of the merger, the whole plan, and then he adopted technocracy, and that's the cameras, that's the systems, that's to apply that to eugenics.
[01:34:13.756 --> 01:34:23.305]  And if you wonder why the New York Times endorses it and why all these elites endorse it, the Venus Project and its founder is part of the technocracy movement.
[01:34:23.305 --> 01:34:26.028]  This is, you live in a giant plastic concentration camp, basically.
[01:34:26.784 --> 01:34:32.128]  With a computer program by the elite, the mega-opolis controlling your life.
[01:34:32.128 --> 01:34:34.569]  I mean, I could not think of a more horrible fate.
[01:34:34.569 --> 01:34:36.191]  We're going to go back to our guest in a moment.
[01:34:36.191 --> 01:34:38.112]  Here's an example of technocracy, okay?
[01:34:38.112 --> 01:34:42.395]  Bureaucracy as a science of control.
[01:34:42.395 --> 01:34:49.720]  And notice the elites, the central bankers the last few years, have been calling themselves, and at Davos they go, we're technocrats.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:55.643]  That's a bureaucrat with 1984 SpyGrids who has a eugenics philosophy.
[01:34:55.643 --> 01:34:56.903]  But briefly, look at this.
[01:34:56.903 --> 01:34:59.845]  Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's IQ.
[01:34:59.845 --> 01:35:13.393]  Out of 20 plus studies conducted, excuse me, 27 studies, I always say 24 for some reason, 27 studies over 24, 22 years, scientifically reviewed by Harvard Medical School and their top researchers,
[01:35:14.727 --> 01:35:22.535]  And the National Research Council, this is not some side group, they said take fluoride out as a pesticide, take it out of the water.
[01:35:22.535 --> 01:35:25.778]  It is giving us massive cancer and dumbing us down.
[01:35:25.778 --> 01:35:27.780]  You might as well have a chemical weapon.
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.302]  It is a chemical weapon.
[01:35:29.302 --> 01:35:32.024]  The Nazis got it from the Russians to put it in the water.
[01:35:32.024 --> 01:35:34.186]  That's a Nuremberg trial.
[01:35:34.186 --> 01:35:35.468]  Now it's in the halogen family.
[01:35:36.775 --> 01:35:38.036]  It's the bad halogen.
[01:35:38.036 --> 01:35:41.679]  What is the good halogen that blocks it and removes it?
[01:35:41.679 --> 01:35:42.920]  Iodine.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.202]  But iodine, if it's not the right type, can be toxic.
[01:35:45.202 --> 01:35:48.084]  That's why we produced the nascent iodine.
[01:35:48.084 --> 01:35:56.610]  The only proprietary type that's in the unbound base with the organic vegetable glycerin from Germany.
[01:35:56.610 --> 01:35:58.332]  Made in America, but the corn's from Germany.
[01:35:58.332 --> 01:36:01.074]  Only place you can get organic corn to make the glycerin.
[01:36:01.074 --> 01:36:02.235]  Very expensive.
[01:36:02.235 --> 01:36:04.016]  The point is, this is what I take.
[01:36:04.016 --> 01:36:04.697]  It's incredible.
[01:36:05.598 --> 01:36:07.879]  And yes, I fund my operation with this, with good products.
[01:36:07.879 --> 01:36:10.000]  That's an example of technocracy.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.781]  Oh, the government before it was like this, in the 20s, said, oh, we're having all this retardation and problems.
[01:36:14.781 --> 01:36:15.862]  Put it in the salt.
[01:36:15.862 --> 01:36:16.922]  Oh, IQs go up 15%.
[01:36:16.922 --> 01:36:18.242]  Here's that study.
[01:36:18.242 --> 01:36:20.703]  Business Insider reports on it.
[01:36:20.703 --> 01:36:22.844]  You see, that's technocracy.
[01:36:22.844 --> 01:36:26.285]  Oh, let's take it out and put the bad thing in.
[01:36:26.285 --> 01:36:27.806]  Then everybody will behave themselves well.
[01:36:28.766 --> 01:36:34.647]  This product is available at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:34.647 --> 01:36:38.308]  And again, this is why the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:36:38.308 --> 01:36:41.769]  Something so simple like that.
[01:36:41.769 --> 01:36:52.431]  And look, even if you don't want to get our high quality nascent iodine at Infowarsstore.com and support the broadcast or Infowarslife.com, the gourmet salts from the Himalayas and other areas
[01:36:53.271 --> 01:36:55.273]  We've had medical doctors on to break it down.
[01:36:55.273 --> 01:36:56.174]  They don't sell it.
[01:36:56.174 --> 01:36:58.336]  I ought to be selling it, because we've got to fund ourselves.
[01:36:58.336 --> 01:37:00.258]  Gourmet salts have it.
[01:37:00.258 --> 01:37:01.219]  Definitely, folks.
[01:37:02.028 --> 01:37:02.969]  Gourmet salt.
[01:37:02.969 --> 01:37:06.693]  Just whatever you do, please, please research this.
[01:37:06.693 --> 01:37:10.356]  Infowarslife.com has videos on it and more to explain it to you.
[01:37:10.356 --> 01:37:24.410]  Okay, now I'm going to shut up because we've only got him for like 25 minutes and we've got the former top secret service agent coming on who made national headlines last week with our story from Infowars.com on DrudgeReport.com where he said, look, it's worse than you know, but he wouldn't go further than that.
[01:37:25.131 --> 01:37:29.254]  I've talked to other Secret Service that say it's unbelievable, we can't tell you.
[01:37:29.254 --> 01:37:33.517]  I'm going to see what I can squeeze out of him coming up at the start of the next hour.
[01:37:33.517 --> 01:37:45.666]  But going back to Patrick Wood, publisher, he's an economist, renowned, exposed the trilaterals, co-wrote the book Trilaterals Over Washington with the icon, Anthony C. Sutton, who blew skull and bones wide open with Charlotte Isserby.
[01:37:46.486 --> 01:37:47.026]  He joins us.
[01:37:47.026 --> 01:37:51.428]  Okay, so get into, we got up to Brzezinski, who he is, who David Rockefeller is.
[01:37:51.428 --> 01:37:55.869]  Tell us, explain technocracy and then what's happening in our world.
[01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:58.010]  Americans don't ought to like communism.
[01:37:58.010 --> 01:38:00.131]  Well, explain what technocracy is.
[01:38:00.131 --> 01:38:05.032]  Communism by the elite, by another name, with them offshore exempt from it.
[01:38:05.032 --> 01:38:06.133]  Patrick Wood, break it down.
[01:38:07.284 --> 01:38:23.430]  Well, when I discovered technocracy as a historical study a few years ago, it really piqued my interest and I said I had to go and research it in depth and I made several trips to secure original research on technocracy.
[01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:33.834]  I found out that it had been skipped in the history books primarily because at the time, in the 30s, Randolph Hearst got so hacked off by being used by these people
[01:38:34.494 --> 01:38:44.217]  That he sent a memo out to all of his newspapers around the country and told them, basically, if you ever mention the word technocracy again, you are fired.
[01:38:44.217 --> 01:38:48.198]  And so there was no more articles on technocracy after that time, really.
[01:38:48.198 --> 01:38:51.559]  And so it was a little difficult going back and getting this information.
[01:38:51.559 --> 01:38:53.280]  But after I studied it enough,
[01:38:54.258 --> 01:39:02.325]  It really occurred to me that I needed to go back and read Zbigniew Brzezinski's book again in light of technocracy.
[01:39:02.325 --> 01:39:13.234]  And what I found out, Alex, is that his writings lined up philosophically and, you know, idea for idea sort of thing with the doctrine and dogma that was presented in the 1930s.
[01:39:13.234 --> 01:39:15.416]  It was very radical back then.
[01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:19.159]  In fact, one prominent technocrat wrote a book, a public book,
[01:39:19.779 --> 01:39:30.311]  Suggesting that President Roosevelt should declare himself dictator after his election so that he could implement technocracy back then.
[01:39:30.311 --> 01:39:33.814]  We can be thankful that he didn't take him up on that.
[01:39:33.814 --> 01:39:36.457]  But life might be different today.
[01:39:36.457 --> 01:39:40.161]  But when I went back and read Kaczynski again,
[01:39:41.102 --> 01:39:45.986]  I was shocked to realize that he was basically saying the same thing.
[01:39:45.986 --> 01:39:49.108]  And here's what's kind of ironic or strange.
[01:39:49.108 --> 01:39:52.911]  Brzezinski was at Columbia University at the time.
[01:39:52.911 --> 01:40:02.019]  Well, in 1932, technocracy as a movement was also housed in Columbia University.
[01:40:03.075 --> 01:40:09.502]  Even though the movement got kicked out, all of the professors that were part of it stayed on at Columbia.
[01:40:09.502 --> 01:40:13.826]  Many of them died there in their positions, you know, retired and passed.
[01:40:13.826 --> 01:40:18.410]  And so here's Brzezinski picking up the trail at the same university where it left off.
[01:40:19.366 --> 01:40:22.067]  Basically spouting the same dogma.
[01:40:22.067 --> 01:40:33.754]  One phrase in particular from his book, one quote, I'd like to read it just because it will just stand your hair on end, that Brzezinski understood this even back in 68-70.
[01:40:33.754 --> 01:40:39.717]  And I'll have to be the first to admit, Brzezinski was a brilliant man.
[01:40:39.717 --> 01:40:43.359]  I don't agree with him on anything he really did or said or wrote.
[01:40:44.059 --> 01:40:47.402]  But you have to give him credit for being a brilliant guy.
[01:40:47.402 --> 01:40:49.943]  He foresaw the future back then.
[01:40:49.943 --> 01:40:53.526]  Of course, they went and manufactured the future after that.
[01:40:53.526 --> 01:40:54.447]  But here's what he wrote.
[01:40:55.731 --> 01:41:01.278]  The Technotronic Era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society.
[01:41:01.278 --> 01:41:04.461]  Such a society would be dominated by an elite
[01:41:15.214 --> 01:41:32.022]  Unrestrained by traditional values, soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen.
[01:41:32.022 --> 01:41:37.404]  These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.
[01:41:38.965 --> 01:41:55.250]  Now, I remember that book being on the bookshelf when I was a small child, and by the time I was 10 and was able to read good, I tried to read it and didn't understand it, but I sat around the kitchen table hearing all this from my father growing up, and that's the Internet.
[01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:56.130]  That's all of it.
[01:41:56.130 --> 01:41:59.791]  It was all built and designed to be this grid.
[01:41:59.791 --> 01:42:04.633]  So they've built a society to control us, and that's the nanny state.
[01:42:04.633 --> 01:42:05.113]  That's the
[01:42:06.405 --> 01:42:09.747]  Close the Greenbelt for no reason and control people.
[01:42:09.747 --> 01:42:11.228]  Set up checkpoints.
[01:42:11.228 --> 01:42:13.170]  Tell your kids they can't play tag.
[01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:15.231]  Say the state rules your kids.
[01:42:15.231 --> 01:42:22.176]  This is putting a grid in the name of keeping us safe in that's actually a grid of tyranny and control.
[01:42:22.176 --> 01:42:33.264]  Well, it's interesting that the documents from the early 1930s specified what needed to take place in order for technocracy to survive or to be implanted.
[01:42:35.778 --> 01:43:00.068]  One of the things, because technocracy was energy-based, one of the main tenets of their philosophy was that the price-based economic system was going to be discarded, that was capitalism of course, and it was going to be substituted by a system of energy credits or energy currency that would be used to monitor all exchange of goods and services in the economy.
[01:43:00.948 --> 01:43:09.079]  And a carbon-based currency, we haven't seen that of course quite yet, but we see the push for carbon-based everything around the world.
[01:43:09.079 --> 01:43:11.742]  This is what sustainable development is about.
[01:43:11.742 --> 01:43:13.985]  This is what everything green is about.
[01:43:13.985 --> 01:43:15.667]  This is what Agenda 21 is.
[01:43:17.369 --> 01:43:18.330]  You get the idea.
[01:43:18.330 --> 01:43:19.971]  It's everywhere today.
[01:43:19.971 --> 01:43:29.741]  And in fact, there are actually articles out in the last five years that are openly discussing carbon currency, but it's really kind of still at a minor moment.
[01:43:29.741 --> 01:43:30.241]  That's right.
[01:43:30.241 --> 01:43:36.487]  And in England, they show the school kids a cartoon called Megapolis, where the computer tells you when you can go outside.
[01:43:36.487 --> 01:43:38.069]  It tells you when you can eat.
[01:43:38.069 --> 01:43:40.130]  Everyone has their job in the technocracy.
[01:43:41.411 --> 01:43:42.712]  You're only allowed to have one child.
[01:44:01.811 --> 01:44:15.821]  1930s by Aldous Huxley, whose brother was a eugenicist and went on to found the transhumanist movement and head up the UN UNESCO program and Agenda 21 and all of it that came out of a meeting in 92.
[01:44:15.821 --> 01:44:24.507]  You really see it's all the same control freak scientific dictatorship system under different names.
[01:44:24.507 --> 01:44:26.969]  It's just that the brilliantly evil Brzezinski
[01:44:28.408 --> 01:44:38.511]  Who believes in things beyond good and evil, foresaw the gestalt, and got the real world manager, David Rockefeller, behind it.
[01:44:38.511 --> 01:44:43.792]  Because David Rockefeller, if you had to say one guy's king of the world, you'd have to say it was David Rockefeller.
[01:44:43.792 --> 01:44:49.034]  Not so much now, but he was the prime mover working 18 hours a day to bring this world government in.
[01:44:49.034 --> 01:44:53.615]  And now his people are in place everywhere, and he chose the Brzezinski model
[01:44:54.475 --> 01:44:55.196]  On record.
[01:44:55.196 --> 01:44:59.242]  And then he integrated it with eco-science eugenicist model.
[01:44:59.242 --> 01:45:01.405]  The injections and the additives to dumb us down.
[01:45:01.405 --> 01:45:03.487]  It's all White House science are on record.
[01:45:03.487 --> 01:45:08.874]  And you realize this is their military battle plan assaulting us and they think we're so dumb.
[01:45:10.498 --> 01:45:12.521]  That we wouldn't get this and warn people.
[01:45:12.521 --> 01:45:22.155]  And the elite's comments to me when I've talked to some of the high-level people, and I mean head of the Kissinger Group on record and others off record, is, Alex, the public can't even understand you.
[01:45:22.155 --> 01:45:25.620]  You're one of us, even if you don't know it, and you're gonna grow up and see that.
[01:45:26.249 --> 01:45:31.571]  I'm going to grow up and see that and block development in the third world when that would actually reduce their population?
[01:45:31.571 --> 01:45:33.091]  What you claim you want?
[01:45:33.091 --> 01:45:37.832]  I've got to see that when you're busy funding Al-Qaeda to then blow stuff up to take my rights?
[01:45:37.832 --> 01:45:41.153]  The point is they claim it's all scientific for the better good.
[01:45:41.153 --> 01:45:45.815]  At the bottom of it is really an authoritarian lust for dehumanization.
[01:45:45.815 --> 01:45:50.156]  And I want you to continue with your presentation and all these slides you sent us for the TV viewers.
[01:45:51.536 --> 01:46:01.061]  Continuing to get into their plan, studying them, and working with Sutton on their larger plan, what would you say their real philosophy was?
[01:46:01.061 --> 01:46:02.862]  I mean, in just ten words or less.
[01:46:02.862 --> 01:46:04.122]  I mean, what is it?
[01:46:04.122 --> 01:46:05.603]  Neo-feudalist?
[01:46:05.603 --> 01:46:07.204]  Just haters of humanity?
[01:46:07.204 --> 01:46:08.224]  Control freaks?
[01:46:08.224 --> 01:46:10.265]  Who are these people?
[01:46:10.265 --> 01:46:12.546]  Well, they're driven by money.
[01:46:12.546 --> 01:46:14.407]  They're driven by a lust for money.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:19.884]  They sought to create a new international economic order in 1973.
[01:46:19.884 --> 01:46:24.428]  I don't really think that game plan has changed.
[01:46:24.428 --> 01:46:25.890]  It's still an economic issue.
[01:46:25.890 --> 01:46:27.531]  It's still about profits.
[01:46:27.531 --> 01:46:30.113]  It's still about manipulation of the markets for their good.
[01:46:31.238 --> 01:46:37.102]  Um, they would press out competition and they have pressed out competition over the decades.
[01:46:37.102 --> 01:46:43.346]  Um, so it's still, they're still looking to make as much money as they can.
[01:46:43.346 --> 01:46:46.748]  They have little regard for the amount of money that you and I might make.
[01:46:46.748 --> 01:46:52.892]  In fact, the original model of technocracy from the thirties did away with private property altogether.
[01:46:52.892 --> 01:46:58.456]  We see this thing picked up in a gen of 21 documents, by the way, that private property is out.
[01:46:59.337 --> 01:47:00.999]  Well sure, they want a post-industrial world.
[01:47:00.999 --> 01:47:04.985]  They want to make us poor, in their own words, as a tool of control.
[01:47:06.069 --> 01:47:10.172]  Well, essentially what they want is just all of our production, Alex.
[01:47:10.172 --> 01:47:14.855]  If you go back to the feudal world, the Dark Ages, it was very dark.
[01:47:14.855 --> 01:47:19.559]  And you look at people back then, they were mostly farmers that grew in, but they were productive.
[01:47:19.559 --> 01:47:22.681]  They were able to grow things and the land yielded stuff.
[01:47:22.681 --> 01:47:29.386]  It's just that the lords of the land took 90% of everything that they grew.
[01:47:30.046 --> 01:47:32.427]  Or the animals they bred.
[01:47:32.427 --> 01:47:38.209]  They were not allowed to keep anything except for just what they needed to stay alive.
[01:47:38.209 --> 01:47:40.130]  And this is kind of where we're going.
[01:47:40.130 --> 01:47:44.792]  They're still looking at getting the output of our hands, if you will.
[01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:47.133]  The output of our production.
[01:47:47.133 --> 01:47:48.994]  But they want it for themselves.
[01:47:48.994 --> 01:47:51.935]  They don't want to share it back with us.
[01:47:51.935 --> 01:47:56.317]  So even in the end, that's still a very economic-oriented
[01:47:57.117 --> 01:48:04.948]  You're right, and they used our energy to build their little castles in the sky for their power trip, so it's robbing our destiny.
[01:48:04.948 --> 01:48:06.170]  Continue with your presentation.
[01:48:06.684 --> 01:48:08.165]  That's exactly right.
[01:48:08.165 --> 01:48:20.753]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in 1970, again in Between Two Ages, and I quote this, he said, The nation-state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force.
[01:48:20.753 --> 01:48:30.300]  International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concept of the nation-state.
[01:48:31.633 --> 01:48:32.874]  Close quote.
[01:48:32.874 --> 01:48:35.958]  That says a mouthful, but this also has not changed.
[01:48:35.958 --> 01:48:42.865]  This philosophy of this elite group has not changed since Brzezinski wrote that in 1970.
[01:48:42.865 --> 01:48:49.632]  And they believe that the nation-state is basically just not compatible with reality, and they are acting as if it did not exist.
[01:48:50.993 --> 01:49:15.388]  So, as they move forward in the world, and in China, and Europe, and of course in India and other minor countries, and especially in North America, as they have moved forward, we can see their fingerprints and their footprints all over the economic scene, and they have used or co-opted the political mechanisms to achieve their new economic order pipe dream.
[01:49:16.598 --> 01:49:17.278]  Well, that's right.
[01:49:17.278 --> 01:49:24.083]  Instead of an economy based on whoever has the best innovations, who's the most honorable, it becomes who is the technocrats?
[01:49:24.083 --> 01:49:25.584]  Who is in control?
[01:49:25.584 --> 01:49:33.949]  And then they're tax-exempt under globalism and have diplomatic immunity, and we are just crushed by total surveillance, which is their plan.
[01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:44.836]  You know, you're old enough to remember some of the old green people from maybe the 60s and 70s with their long hair and so on.
[01:49:44.836 --> 01:49:51.546]  If you can find one of those original green people today and talk to them about the current state of the green movement,
[01:49:51.846 --> 01:50:01.215]  You'll see him spitting molten nails because they believe that their movement was taken over by these people, the Rockefeller crowd and so on.
[01:50:01.215 --> 01:50:03.257]  They were given a lot of money.
[01:50:03.257 --> 01:50:06.520]  Then they were told after they had the money, well, you're not managing right.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:09.123]  We need to send in our managers to manage your organization.
[01:50:09.483 --> 01:50:25.194]  And basically the whole green movement got hijacked by this group and now has been turned on us, of course showered with money, but it has been turned on us to bring this green agenda to bring in an energy-based society.
[01:50:25.894 --> 01:50:32.300]  And as an economic system, I can't stress that enough, because that's what smart grid is all about, for instance.
[01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:35.242]  That's what cap-and-trade is all about, for instance.
[01:50:35.242 --> 01:50:37.844]  That's what global warming is all about, for instance.
[01:50:37.844 --> 01:50:48.793]  With Al Gore being on the front of every publication, almost, that has anything to do with global warming, Al Gore is a member of the Trilateral Commission.
[01:50:48.793 --> 01:50:49.174]  Still is.
[01:50:49.454 --> 01:50:49.895]  That's right.
[01:50:49.895 --> 01:50:50.276]  Stay there.
[01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:52.680]  We're going to come back with our guest to break this down.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.863]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:50:54.863 --> 01:50:56.226]  You can follow us on Twitter.
[01:50:56.226 --> 01:50:59.271]  You can check out Patrick Wood's site, AugustForecast.com.
[01:51:01.212 --> 01:51:06.694]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:51:06.694 --> 01:51:15.576]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:51:15.576 --> 01:51:23.399]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:51:23.399 --> 01:51:30.801]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[01:52:01.175 --> 01:52:04.177]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[01:52:04.177 --> 01:52:10.541]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:16.925]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:52:17.345 --> 01:52:19.627]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:52:19.627 --> 01:52:20.968]  They're the good guys.

[01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:28.553]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer and it's revolutionary.

[01:52:47.505 --> 01:53:03.612]  My name is Frank Bates and I got a confession to make.
[01:53:03.612 --> 01:53:11.455]  Just a few days ago, FEMA went directly to my supplier and tried to buy my entire stockpile of high quality survival food.
[01:53:11.455 --> 01:53:15.177]  It sounds crazy, but I'll show you the exact letter they sent in a minute.
[01:53:15.737 --> 01:53:21.940]  Revealing FEMA's plot could land me in hot water, and I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:31.725]  Go to FEMAHatesThis.com to see an undeniable video of proof that the government is on the hunt for as much survival food as they can grab in 24 hours.
[01:53:31.725 --> 01:53:37.768]  Be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't.
[01:53:37.768 --> 01:53:42.411]  Go to FEMAHatesThis.com to see why survival food is the number one item to hoard right now.
[01:53:42.871 --> 01:53:48.860]  And why supplies are so low or even completely sold out already at many stores across America.
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:56.171]  Do it now because I don't know how long it will be online so go to FEMAHatesThis.com while you can.
[01:53:56.171 --> 01:53:58.033]  That's FEMAHatesThis.com
[01:54:13.359 --> 01:54:16.882]  Don't want no shackles.
[01:54:16.882 --> 01:54:18.843]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:18.843 --> 01:54:23.407]  Folks, here's an example of how the propaganda is 24-7.
[01:54:23.407 --> 01:54:33.295]  I was in the coffee room this morning watching MSNBC monitoring state-run media and they were promoting the end of the earth because of the hurricane or the
[01:54:36.755 --> 01:54:40.519]  Typhoon that hit the Philippines and saying Al Gore was right.
[01:54:40.519 --> 01:54:42.921]  We've got to do the carbon taxes.
[01:54:42.921 --> 01:54:45.183]  That will save it.
[01:54:45.183 --> 01:54:56.814]  And then just now during the break on CNN, they're worshiping Ted Turner and his far-reaching impact was the headline and how he is saving the earth.
[01:54:56.814 --> 01:54:58.775]  I mean, it's just never-ending.
[01:54:58.775 --> 01:55:00.317]  Let us run the world.
[01:55:00.317 --> 01:55:01.358]  We're saving you.
[01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:10.789]  And then meanwhile, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller, all of them are on record supporting an 80 plus percent population reduction.
[01:55:10.789 --> 01:55:12.170]  We're joined by Patrick Wood.
[01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:13.992]  He sent us amazing documents today.
[01:55:13.992 --> 01:55:19.557]  If you're a TV viewer, we've been putting these documents and documentation and quotes up on screen.
[01:55:19.557 --> 01:55:21.558]  We've got until five after next hour.
[01:55:21.558 --> 01:55:25.942]  Then we've got the famous Secret Service agent joining us with Inside Intel.
[01:55:25.942 --> 01:55:29.905]  But Patrick, in the time we've got left in this segment and the next, I want to have you back very soon.
[01:55:31.427 --> 01:55:44.787]  Get into their philosophy, eugenics, how it ties into the older globalist plans and all the other key points that people need to know about technocracy, the system that we're going under right now.
[01:55:45.885 --> 01:55:53.773]  Well, we haven't really broached the subject of transhumanism and I don't know that we have time to do that.
[01:55:53.773 --> 01:55:55.194]  Start getting into it.
[01:55:55.194 --> 01:56:04.664]  The Rockefeller crowd back in the 30s, well the 1920s and 30s, poured a lot of money into the eugenics movement.
[01:56:04.864 --> 01:56:06.446]  And it was a very big movement back then.
[01:56:06.446 --> 01:56:15.518]  It's kind of been buried, especially buried since World War II with Nazi Germany's experience with eugenics.
[01:56:15.518 --> 01:56:18.782]  Kind of been a taboo topic and hasn't been discussed much.
[01:56:18.782 --> 01:56:20.865]  Yeah, they call it implementation by stealth.
[01:56:20.865 --> 01:56:21.967]  That's their official policy.
[01:56:22.588 --> 01:56:25.010]  Well, it is now, for sure.
[01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:35.198]  Back then, though, since there wasn't a lot of money poured on top of Technocracy Incorporated, eugenics was not really part of their agenda.
[01:56:35.198 --> 01:56:36.820]  Not directly, in any case.
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:48.530]  Some of their members were obviously influenced by the genetics, by the eugenics movement back then, but that was not really an official part of their platform, if you will.
[01:56:49.851 --> 01:56:51.652]  They were very economic in nature.
[01:56:51.652 --> 01:56:59.057]  They were focused on creating an economy that would be balanced, that would be free of poverty.
[01:56:59.057 --> 01:57:03.199]  Exactly, but David Rockefeller wants to use it to carry out eugenics.
[01:57:03.199 --> 01:57:06.862]  He wants a computerized, weaponized system to dehumanize.
[01:57:07.895 --> 01:57:19.582]  Well, yes, we can see the dovetail in modern times where eugenics is an undercurrent that's starting to kind of come back to the surface in this.
[01:57:19.582 --> 01:57:22.204]  Transhumanism really brings this out.
[01:57:22.204 --> 01:57:27.507]  Transhumanism and technocracy are like Siamese twins joined at the hip, if you will.
[01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:31.010]  They're both based on scientism, the philosophy of scientism.
[01:57:31.610 --> 01:57:41.035]  And transhumanism basically sets up a society of the haves and the have-nots, again, based on genetic modification.
[01:57:41.035 --> 01:57:57.944]  And so those who are genetically enhanced, if you will, will be the haves, and the rest of the people who are not genetically enhanced, maybe they won't be as smart, maybe they won't be as strong or athletic or whatever, they will be the have-nots.
[01:57:58.764 --> 01:58:07.607]  And, you know, basically we'll end up with a eugenic system that can be controlled by push-button rather than by edict as it was during Nazi Germany.
[01:58:07.607 --> 01:58:15.329]  And then people will beg to be enslaved by the new genetic modifications in the toxic environment when it's really a Trojan horse back door of control.
[01:58:15.329 --> 01:58:16.690]  That's how they always sell it.
[01:58:17.410 --> 01:58:29.034]  Absolutely on target with your research, and of course, as you said, Huxley was one of these transhumanists before it even had the term, and his brother founded that movement when eugenics was given a bad name on record.
[01:58:29.034 --> 01:58:32.555]  We're gonna come back in 60 seconds, give you five more minutes, dig into other tidbits.
[01:58:32.555 --> 01:58:35.396]  We'll definitely have to have you back in the near future.
[01:58:35.396 --> 01:58:38.396]  Third hour coming up, InfoWars.com.

[01:58:51.297 --> 01:58:57.938]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:58:57.938 --> 01:59:00.339]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:59:00.339 --> 01:59:00.759]  The U.S.
[01:59:00.759 --> 01:59:05.000]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.960]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:09.441]  They want that attack to come.
[01:59:09.441 --> 01:59:15.622]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:59:16.038 --> 01:59:18.700]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:23.665]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:59:23.665 --> 01:59:31.111]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:59:31.411 --> 01:59:34.173]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:59:34.173 --> 01:59:37.275]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[02:00:10.450 --> 02:00:12.051]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.051 --> 02:00:13.591]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.591 --> 02:00:17.793]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.793 --> 02:00:21.834]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:38.244]  Alright, final segment with the man that heads up augustforecast.com, the amazing Patrick Wood.
[02:00:38.244 --> 02:00:45.170]  And I tell you, next time I'm out of town, because this excites me so much I won't shut up, but I'm adding important info.
[02:00:45.170 --> 02:00:49.194]  And like David Knight does the show, he's a smart engineer, knows about this stuff.
[02:00:49.194 --> 02:00:51.096]  You ought to have Wood on for like two hours.
[02:00:52.793 --> 02:00:58.957]  So the next time I'm out of town or the next time I'm not doing the show and I have night doing it, I want to get wood on for two hours.
[02:00:58.957 --> 02:01:02.118]  Patrick, what have we not covered today that people need to know about?
[02:01:02.118 --> 02:01:06.201]  I think it's important that suddenly the globalists, the new term they use is technocrat.
[02:01:06.201 --> 02:01:11.143]  I mean, they're really trying to make that sexy and, you know, it's not surveillance that they watch everything we do.
[02:01:11.143 --> 02:01:15.326]  They're watching it to make the economy better, but really they're just giving it to the insiders.
[02:01:16.257 --> 02:01:25.275]  Well, you know, the spooky thing is, let me read you two of the official requirements from the 1932 document called Technocracy Study Course.
[02:01:25.275 --> 02:01:26.999]  That was kind of their Bible of the day.
[02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:35.653]  One said, quote, provide a specific registration of the type, kind, et cetera, of all goods and services where produced or where used.
[02:01:35.653 --> 02:01:44.797]  The next one says, provide specific registration of the consumption of each individual plus a record and description of the individual.
[02:01:44.797 --> 02:01:50.260]  And Alex, this is exactly what the Total Surveillance Society is doing to us right now.
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:56.423]  They're collecting all of the financial records as well as any other profile or psychographic information they can get
[02:01:57.043 --> 02:02:03.690]  So they can slice us and dice us economically, if you will, and put us in, you know, maybe pigeonhole us politically as well.
[02:02:03.690 --> 02:02:05.872]  You know, there are threats to their system.
[02:02:05.872 --> 02:02:15.843]  But this is an economic movement to try and extract the maximum amount possible from individual consumers.
[02:02:15.843 --> 02:02:17.204]  It's very consumer centric.
[02:02:17.825 --> 02:02:23.627]  But everything is focused on collecting this information to make this system work.
[02:02:23.627 --> 02:02:33.752]  This is the last piece, according to the original documents of technocracy, that needs to be put in place before technocracy can actually be enforced.
[02:02:34.815 --> 02:02:40.997]  And that's why I'm really concerned today about this total awareness society business.
[02:02:40.997 --> 02:02:52.501]  Because when they get this in place completely, somewhere in knowledge is power, of course, there's going to come a time when they can flip the switch and basically say, we're now in control.
[02:02:52.501 --> 02:02:53.922]  And now you will do what we say.
[02:02:54.022 --> 02:02:54.862]  That's right.
[02:02:54.862 --> 02:02:56.703]  It's a total military takeover.
[02:02:56.703 --> 02:02:59.404]  The smart meters controlling how hot or cold our house is.
[02:02:59.404 --> 02:03:02.625]  The satellites not letting us cut a tiny tree in our backyard.
[02:03:02.625 --> 02:03:05.026]  Just absolute bureaucratic hell.
[02:03:05.026 --> 02:03:08.747]  And then the robots get rid of the regular jobs and the farming.
[02:03:08.747 --> 02:03:13.709]  So literally, like a Kurt Vonnegut book, their plan is to have a third of the population as enforcers.
[02:03:13.709 --> 02:03:20.751]  And they're going to hire the people they poisoned through the eugenics operation to literally rule over those of us that are informed.
[02:03:20.751 --> 02:03:23.332]  So it's not even the eugenics that they've claimed they're building.
[02:03:24.457 --> 02:03:30.721]  If somebody wanted really to feed the world, what we need to do is increase the CO2 content in the atmosphere by 10%.
[02:03:30.721 --> 02:03:32.943]  That's right.
[02:03:32.943 --> 02:03:34.664]  It would feed the world in a heartbeat.
[02:03:34.664 --> 02:03:42.509]  But when you take CO2 out, plants can't grow, crops can't thrive, and people starve.
[02:03:42.509 --> 02:03:48.393]  See, I would endorse a real open market, open source technocracy.
[02:03:49.073 --> 02:03:51.857]  That empowered and had us go to Alpha Centauri's.
[02:03:51.857 --> 02:04:01.008]  But this, this, this, this technocracy is a bunch of beam counting communists adopted by robber baron eugenicists that openly are using it as a weapon system.
[02:04:01.008 --> 02:04:05.433]  And so we've got to point out technocracy is what's delivering the poverty.
[02:04:05.433 --> 02:04:06.094]  It's the enemy.
[02:04:07.290 --> 02:04:12.433]  It is the enemy, and the people who have brought us technocracy are the enemy as well.
[02:04:12.433 --> 02:04:22.439]  I wouldn't really lay the blame necessarily at the feet of congressmen and senators, but, you know, because they've mostly been useful idiots and not really knowing what they're doing.
[02:04:22.439 --> 02:04:28.863]  But if we look behind it to these people who have brought us technocracy, this is where the trouble is.
[02:04:28.863 --> 02:04:34.987]  And if we don't get rid of those people and get them out of our government system and get them off our back,
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:40.502]  They will not be stopped, and we will never be satisfied.
[02:04:40.502 --> 02:04:44.443]  You know, how much water can you squeeze out of a sponge?
[02:04:44.443 --> 02:04:46.304]  This is what they're doing to us.
[02:04:46.304 --> 02:04:50.626]  And the only way to get more water out of the sponge is to wring it harder and harder.
[02:04:50.626 --> 02:04:50.986]  That's right.
[02:04:50.986 --> 02:04:51.707]  That's the plan.
[02:04:51.707 --> 02:04:53.827]  Patrick Wood, Augustforecast.com.
[02:04:53.827 --> 02:04:55.548]  We're going to be talking to you soon.
[02:04:55.548 --> 02:04:57.369]  Post can find your great work right there.
[02:04:57.369 --> 02:04:58.409]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:04:58.409 --> 02:04:59.530]  Thank you, Alec.
[02:05:01.522 --> 02:05:06.984]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:05:06.984 --> 02:05:15.866]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:05:15.866 --> 02:05:23.689]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:05:23.689 --> 02:05:31.091]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[02:05:31.591 --> 02:05:35.554]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[02:05:35.554 --> 02:05:39.738]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[02:05:39.738 --> 02:05:46.884]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[02:05:46.884 --> 02:05:54.109]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front.
[02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:58.153]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[02:06:00.768 --> 02:06:06.556]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:06:06.556 --> 02:06:13.945]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:06:13.945 --> 02:06:17.309]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.

[02:08:02.146 --> 02:08:17.105]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.291 --> 02:08:32.754]  And then all that NSA data grabbed illegally can be used as top secret service agent, now retired.
[02:08:32.754 --> 02:08:35.695]  Dan Bongino has told the public.
[02:08:35.695 --> 02:08:44.258]  And he quit a few years ago because he said he couldn't be around the un-American, anti-free market, you didn't build it, garbage.
[02:08:44.258 --> 02:08:49.541]  And he said, look, I can't tell you what I saw behind the scenes, but it's worse than you know.
[02:08:49.541 --> 02:08:52.942]  And that article that we put out last week with the video of him talking about it,
[02:08:53.422 --> 02:08:53.562]  Yes.
[02:09:08.359 --> 02:09:09.659]  I'm a Secret Service agent.
[02:09:09.659 --> 02:09:12.400]  It's worse than people know, and I'm not trying to scare you.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:19.841]  We've only got 10 minutes with him, because he's in a gear up for his book about to come out, but he's on for like an hour when it does come out in a few weeks.
[02:09:19.841 --> 02:09:21.682]  Dan Bongino, Bongino.com.
[02:09:21.682 --> 02:09:24.102]  He's running, obviously, for higher office.
[02:09:24.102 --> 02:09:27.403]  We'll tell you about that briefly, but in the time we've got, come on, tell us.
[02:09:27.403 --> 02:09:31.443]  I mean, I know you're already getting threats, you're getting your office broken into, stuff's going on.
[02:09:31.443 --> 02:09:33.944]  I think not telling us is going to put you in more danger.
[02:09:34.844 --> 02:09:41.346]  Than telling us, what is it that's so horrible, that's worse than we know, worse than we think, at the White House?
[02:09:41.346 --> 02:09:43.947]  You were the head guy that ran his foreign trips.
[02:09:43.947 --> 02:09:50.509]  We know that's the most important position in the Secret Service, because that scene is the most dangerous, is when the President goes overseas.
[02:09:50.509 --> 02:09:52.990]  I mean, tell us who Obama really is.
[02:09:52.990 --> 02:10:00.732]  We've got Harry Lennox coming out saying he's basically an actor, and that he secretly trained him 18 years ago.
[02:10:00.732 --> 02:10:03.053]  Dan Bongino, what's really going on here?
[02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:04.842]  Well, here's the deal, Alex.
[02:10:04.842 --> 02:10:13.053]  You even have new things coming out with the financial monitoring, which you're seeing today with the agency, the CIA, with financial transactions overseas.
[02:10:13.053 --> 02:10:15.197]  So think of the picture right now, the government.
[02:10:15.197 --> 02:10:18.802]  You know, this big government mentality, big government president.
[02:10:19.342 --> 02:10:26.364]  They now have your email, allegedly just the subject and headers and the to and from, which I strongly would debate.
[02:10:26.364 --> 02:10:32.265]  They now have consumer financial data from any transactions you may have made overseas.
[02:10:32.265 --> 02:10:41.167]  And the Consumer Financial Relations Board right now, they're internally, they're developing a whole profile of credit card company data as well.
[02:10:41.727 --> 02:10:50.450]  So we're getting into this society right now, the surveillance society, where as I said on that clip, which got something like, I think even the YouTube got 400 plus thousand views.
[02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:59.373]  You're in a society now where your life is really no longer your life, it's your life which is available for public consumption at the government's behest.
[02:10:59.373 --> 02:11:04.055]  They have the key to your personal and private life, which I find really frightening.
[02:11:04.055 --> 02:11:09.217]  And when I said worse than you know, that's exactly what I meant, because here's what's really bothersome about this whole thing, Alex.
[02:11:10.133 --> 02:11:20.256]  It really doesn't seem that anybody's really that disturbed about it, besides, you know, folks in the Libertarian, I think, wing of the party that, you know, that are raising the flag here.
[02:11:20.256 --> 02:11:28.918]  But, you know, last time I was on the show, I had a bunch of your listeners jump on and follow me, and they're really active, and they're really getting involved.
[02:11:29.718 --> 02:11:35.603]  Well, specifically, I talked to a Secret Service agent, and this is pretty unbelievable, but it's true.
[02:11:35.603 --> 02:11:39.386]  I don't even like saying this, but he didn't give me anything secret.
[02:11:39.386 --> 02:11:40.727]  He just said, keep doing what you're doing.
[02:11:40.727 --> 02:11:41.687]  It's horrible.
[02:11:41.687 --> 02:11:43.789]  Almost all of us are freaked out.
[02:11:43.789 --> 02:11:44.950]  It's unbelievable.
[02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:48.973]  Obama is basically worse than you're even saying.
[02:11:48.973 --> 02:11:53.957]  I heard this about a year ago, and then from another Secret Service agent, through another person I know.
[02:11:55.436 --> 02:11:59.137]  I mean, they wouldn't even talk to me, except through somebody else's phone.
[02:11:59.137 --> 02:12:03.459]  And then one of them passed a message on to me, and they said, look, you're right, it's bad.
[02:12:03.459 --> 02:12:04.359]  I mean, what's going on?
[02:12:04.359 --> 02:12:10.822]  I mean, we know Hillary had, like, crack pipes on the Christmas tree back in the 90s, and like Mao Zedong.
[02:12:10.822 --> 02:12:15.163]  We know seven of the czars publicly praised Mao Zedong, the greatest mass murderer in history.
[02:12:15.163 --> 02:12:19.124]  Tell us, like, you said you had to quit, it was so horrible, but you can't tell us.
[02:12:19.124 --> 02:12:20.405]  I mean, tell us what Obama's like.
[02:12:20.967 --> 02:12:25.072]  Well, listen, I don't want to get into his personal stuff because it would be inappropriate.
[02:12:25.072 --> 02:12:29.837]  I mean, it did take an oath, but I feel the need to sound the siren here because...
[02:12:30.829 --> 02:12:42.943]  You know, the Secret Service, there was some hack on the Republican side, of course, a lot of the establishment folks tend to come after me as well, that took a shot at me and my book, Life Inside the Bubble.
[02:12:42.943 --> 02:12:51.933]  He took a shot at me basically saying that, oh, you know, you shouldn't do that because then the Secret Service, it'll damage the sensitive relationship between the Secret Service and President Alex.
[02:12:52.455 --> 02:13:04.150]  You know, when I say worse than you know, this fog of scandals encompassing just about every cabinet agency, whether EPA, the HHS, you know, DOJ, they're all encompassed by scandals.
[02:13:04.150 --> 02:13:05.872]  I don't have time to go into each and every one of them.
[02:13:05.872 --> 02:13:07.013]  Most of them are public.
[02:13:07.013 --> 02:13:08.856]  But even look at something like the Secret Service.
[02:13:09.276 --> 02:13:14.060]  You know, they were used as some kind of a pawn in the shutting down the White House to White House tours.
[02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:16.241]  And you may say, oh, well, that's an insignificant thing.
[02:13:16.241 --> 02:13:17.963]  You know, they just blame the Secret Service.
[02:13:17.963 --> 02:13:19.564]  We all inside know what's true.
[02:13:19.564 --> 02:13:21.365]  We just look for an excuse.
[02:13:21.365 --> 02:13:30.452]  But what's to say later on that, you know, he doesn't say to the Secret Service guys, you know, something to the effect of, you know, hey, listen, I want those guys, you know, arrested for protesting or something.
[02:13:30.452 --> 02:13:32.854]  And they feel the need to, you know, somehow comply.
[02:13:33.385 --> 02:13:39.168]  We can't go forward in a society where we're not bedrocked in some sense of constitutional law.
[02:13:39.168 --> 02:13:43.350]  You know, law by discretion and rule by discretion is no rule at all.
[02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:44.190]  It's monarchy.
[02:13:44.190 --> 02:13:46.731]  I mean, it's almost near anarchy at some point.
[02:13:46.731 --> 02:13:49.032]  So we can't have this.
[02:13:49.032 --> 02:13:52.054]  It's the responsibility of people like me, I believe, to speak out.
[02:13:52.054 --> 02:13:57.436]  Some may disagree, and that's fine, but I'm not going to get buried six feet deep, though, when I was part of the problem.
[02:13:57.436 --> 02:13:58.036]  Sure, sure, Dan.
[02:13:58.036 --> 02:13:59.777]  I don't want to know about Obama's boyfriends.
[02:13:59.777 --> 02:14:01.658]  What I want to know about is
[02:14:01.798 --> 02:14:01.978]  Yes.
[02:14:19.753 --> 02:14:27.279]  And so, I mean, it's almost dangerous for me to be here pushing you to say anything, but, I mean, what else can you tell us when you say it's worse than we know?
[02:14:27.279 --> 02:14:35.685]  I mean, I know Secret Service agents went public against Clinton, and they even got photos out of the Mao Zedong on the Christmas tree and the crack pipes.
[02:14:35.685 --> 02:14:40.929]  I mean, what type of weirdos hang crack pipes and communist leaders on the Christmas tree?
[02:14:40.929 --> 02:14:41.810]  These are screwballs.
[02:14:42.284 --> 02:14:50.291]  Well, and they're surrounded by, as I said on another show, these acolytes that don't want to tell him he's doing anything wrong.
[02:14:50.291 --> 02:14:55.116]  And they don't want to speak up and say, you know, sir, maybe this isn't right that we handled it.
[02:14:55.116 --> 02:15:01.101]  And surrounding yourself with figures that view you as some kind of messianic figure is really troublesome.
[02:15:01.101 --> 02:15:05.205]  I mean, that's the kind of thing we see in, you know, third world countries, that these
[02:15:05.658 --> 02:15:06.138]  We're good.
[02:15:28.806 --> 02:15:33.647]  So they should leave you alone and not follow you around and make threats and break in your office?
[02:15:56.573 --> 02:16:00.974]  Yeah, I mean, but there's nothing I've done unethically or anything like that.
[02:16:00.974 --> 02:16:11.956]  I mean, I'm running because I really feel like there's a very deep problem where there's like, we are literally in a constitutional crisis right now where the president just ignores his own fiat and it doesn't seem like anybody's saying anything.
[02:16:11.956 --> 02:16:12.937]  I mean, where are you hearing it?
[02:16:12.937 --> 02:16:18.618]  But what is it that being around him freaks out Secret Service so bad?
[02:16:18.618 --> 02:16:23.219]  It's more that it's not, it doesn't seem to me like anybody is willing
[02:16:24.269 --> 02:16:29.172]  To say, you know, like the Clinton administration where at one point he had, you know, Dick Morris.
[02:16:29.172 --> 02:16:30.333]  But is he like the devil?
[02:16:30.333 --> 02:16:32.654]  I mean, we see flies coming out of his mouth.
[02:16:32.654 --> 02:16:38.898]  What has Secret Service agents literally running the other direction through the wall like a Looney Tunes character?
[02:16:39.418 --> 02:16:42.640]  Well, again, I know, I do pray now.
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:44.241]  There's none of that stuff.
[02:16:44.241 --> 02:16:45.321]  I'm joking, it's a joke.
[02:16:45.321 --> 02:16:46.582]  I know, I know.
[02:16:46.582 --> 02:16:47.963]  Well, Dan, let me ask you these questions.
[02:16:47.963 --> 02:16:49.984]  We have an article up on Infowars.com.
[02:16:49.984 --> 02:16:55.627]  Obamacare fix affirms Obama as absolute dictator with power to change laws as he pleases.
[02:16:55.627 --> 02:17:03.611]  Even the former head of the DNC has come out and said that this is dictator behavior.
[02:17:03.611 --> 02:17:05.793]  How can he now claim his own law?
[02:17:05.793 --> 02:17:07.934]  He'll decide what to enforce and not to enforce.
[02:17:08.763 --> 02:17:11.526]  Yeah, I mean, this isn't the first time either.
[02:17:11.526 --> 02:17:19.154]  You had the exemption for Congress, you had the out-of-pocket requirements he waived, you had the income requirements he waived, you had the employer mandate he waived.
[02:17:19.154 --> 02:17:28.364]  I mean, this is the odd part about this thick sense of politics on the side where they say, oh, it's the law of the land, and then they turn around five minutes later and they ignore the law of the land.
[02:17:28.704 --> 02:17:40.186]  Which the law of the land I would argue initially wasn't constitutional, but as an extra slap in the face, even once they declared constitutional what wasn't constitutional, he unconstitutionally violated it.
[02:17:40.186 --> 02:17:44.867]  If that's like making your head spin right now, I assure you it's making my head spin too.
[02:17:44.867 --> 02:17:53.229]  The great irony being the cancellations that they're trying to avoid are going to be re-cancelled next year with the re-implementation of an unconstitutional law.
[02:17:53.229 --> 02:17:53.849]  It's crazy!
[02:17:55.169 --> 02:18:04.762]  And again, the word is, from a lot of high-level sources, this is even hitting mainstream, but I heard it from you as well, the word is they did blackmail members of the Supreme Court.
[02:18:04.762 --> 02:18:06.905]  Oh, I didn't, no, I don't know anything about that.
[02:18:06.905 --> 02:18:09.929]  Well, you mentioned that the NSA can be used to blackmail people.
[02:18:10.322 --> 02:18:12.083]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[02:18:12.083 --> 02:18:13.323]  I mean, the NSA can always be.
[02:18:13.323 --> 02:18:14.144]  That's my worry.
[02:18:14.144 --> 02:18:17.405]  I mean, they have congressional BlackBerry records and everything.
[02:18:17.405 --> 02:18:19.666]  I mean, this should be a real problem for folks.
[02:18:19.666 --> 02:18:27.609]  And again, the NSA thing, when I mentioned the foggiest candle, seems to be lost in this bigger picture because nobody knows what to focus on.
[02:18:27.609 --> 02:18:29.430]  Is it the Obamacare crisis?
[02:18:29.430 --> 02:18:32.671]  Is it the HHS shaking down health insurance industries?
[02:18:32.671 --> 02:18:35.252]  Is it the EPA bankrupting the coal industry?
[02:18:35.252 --> 02:18:38.353]  Completely unconstitutional, you know, against the Takings Clause.
[02:18:38.353 --> 02:18:39.794]  I mean, where do we focus?
[02:18:40.154 --> 02:18:44.556]  And I think it's almost like one of these buckshot strategies rather than rifle slug.
[02:18:44.556 --> 02:18:51.519]  Just fire the buckshot and one of them is eventually going to hit and nobody knows where to block because there's just so much going on right now.
[02:18:51.519 --> 02:18:59.902]  Even the Republican Party, even the Libertarian wing of the Republican Party in Congress, nobody knows where to focus because there's just so much going on.
[02:18:59.902 --> 02:19:05.245]  I was about to say, we've only got about five minutes left with you, but I want to get into this with you and then talk about your book and the campaign here briefly.
[02:19:05.925 --> 02:19:10.646]  Talk about it yet, but I was sent an advance copy, read it, total page turner.
[02:19:10.646 --> 02:19:11.907]  It's life inside the bubble.
[02:19:11.907 --> 02:19:13.747]  Folks can see I have the advance copy right here.
[02:19:13.747 --> 02:19:16.508]  I got it about a month ago, but so we're going to talk about when that's coming out.
[02:19:16.508 --> 02:19:20.589]  But top Secret Service agent left because he wouldn't be dishonorable.
[02:19:20.589 --> 02:19:21.809]  That's all he said.
[02:19:21.809 --> 02:19:23.630]  He's with us, Bongino.com.
[02:19:23.630 --> 02:19:25.390]  Dan Bongino, he's running for Congress.
[02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:32.352]  But sir, I want to expand on this briefly with you, because you're one of the only people that's astutely said this, and I know this is their plan.
[02:19:32.952 --> 02:20:02.365]  Because I've read some of the political warfare strategies the CFR puts out, and they admit this, that that's almost a plan is to flood so much corruption, bomb-rushing everyone, that it's almost like when criminals take over an area and break the will of the public and just set the precedent that it's a crime zone, that that's what Obama and crew were doing, is just rushing to the finish line, hoping that they gain a million miles, and even if we push them back half a million, they still win.
[02:20:02.865 --> 02:20:05.006]  Well, that's a great analogy, the crime analogy.
[02:20:05.006 --> 02:20:08.369]  Because in New York, that's exactly what happened when I lived in New York.
[02:20:08.369 --> 02:20:11.190]  And how they stopped it was the broken windows theory.
[02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:13.552]  Meaning at some point, you have to draw the line and say, you know what?
[02:20:13.552 --> 02:20:20.917]  You get caught drinking in public, even though there's murders going on down the street, we're going to arrest you too, because you may be the guy that's doing the shooting later on.
[02:20:21.497 --> 02:20:28.261]  And I think we have to take that broken windows theory to government now and say, you know, we're not even going to accept mild constitutional violations anymore.
[02:20:28.261 --> 02:20:30.063]  We're going to issue congressional subpoenas.
[02:20:30.063 --> 02:20:31.804]  We're going to put you up on the hill.
[02:20:31.804 --> 02:20:34.205]  And I mean, what's going to happen in the IRS?
[02:20:34.205 --> 02:20:37.607]  Someone in the IRS will use that to go after congressional groups.
[02:20:37.607 --> 02:20:39.329]  Why did someone come out and handcuff over there?
[02:20:39.329 --> 02:20:41.210]  I mean, this was completely unethical.
[02:20:41.210 --> 02:20:42.911]  You start seeing people in the bracelet.
[02:20:43.331 --> 02:20:51.183]  Walking out and perp walking people who violated your constitutional liberty and people testifying up on the hill every Thursday and Friday.
[02:20:51.183 --> 02:20:54.107]  I assure you something's going to change, but nobody's willing to do it right now.
[02:20:54.107 --> 02:20:55.630]  Your analogy was spot on.
[02:20:56.297 --> 02:21:00.298]  You know, before that, you were also a decorated Newark police officer, weren't you?
[02:21:00.298 --> 02:21:00.978]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:21:00.978 --> 02:21:01.998]  I'm going from memory.
[02:21:01.998 --> 02:21:17.921]  I can't think of a better congressman than somebody that's been a police officer with a good record, then a great Secret Service agent with a great record, who went public about, you know, the fact that he couldn't morally be there and is now running for Congress and is now having the entire political system come after you.
[02:21:17.921 --> 02:21:25.383]  When you have the rhino Republican leadership attacking you, that is a seal of approval for me that you're a patriot.
[02:21:25.863 --> 02:21:27.546]  Do you like the ideas of Rand Paul?
[02:21:27.546 --> 02:21:28.768]  Do you like Ted Cruz?
[02:21:28.768 --> 02:21:32.454]  I mean, tell us about, just briefly, in a minute or two, your political philosophy.
[02:21:32.981 --> 02:21:37.303]  Oh yeah, mine's absolutely bedrocked in libertarian, limited government values.
[02:21:37.303 --> 02:21:39.463]  I always say to folks, they say, you're a Republican.
[02:21:39.463 --> 02:21:42.304]  I say, no, I have to run as one, because there's a two-party system.
[02:21:42.304 --> 02:21:46.726]  But you know you're doing something right, Alex, when the barbs come at you from both directions.
[02:21:46.726 --> 02:21:50.207]  You know, a guy went after me the other day, a D.C.
[02:21:50.207 --> 02:21:52.608]  lobbyist, former so-called Republican.
[02:21:52.608 --> 02:21:56.669]  You read what he has to say, a man who's profited handsomely off his insider connection.
[02:21:56.669 --> 02:22:00.751]  So, you know you're doing it right when both parties are slinging arrows at you.
[02:22:01.411 --> 02:22:04.733]  Well, look at the former head of the RNC, Steele.
[02:22:04.733 --> 02:22:09.995]  Sounds like, you know, he's left of Lenin or something, to use that political paradigm.
[02:22:09.995 --> 02:22:18.819]  Briefly, you told me off-air, I mean, it wasn't a secret, but you said the New York Police Department is really waking up to political corruption now as well.
[02:22:18.819 --> 02:22:19.560]  What's happening there?
[02:22:20.168 --> 02:22:32.820]  Yeah, last time, I think it was last time we spoke, I mentioned a lot of my friends are calling me and they're just astounded by everything that's going on up there with all of these, the surveillance state in New York and some of the things you're being asked to do.
[02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:35.222]  You know, a lot of people are starting to say, is this right?
[02:22:35.222 --> 02:22:40.167]  I think it was just assumed because it landed on your desk and had been vetted through some channels that this was all okay.
[02:22:40.167 --> 02:22:44.571]  And people may have been automatons in the past, but that's not happening anymore.
[02:22:44.571 --> 02:22:45.792]  A lot of folks, even some of my
[02:22:46.212 --> 02:22:48.134]  Friends in the government are starting to call me.
[02:22:48.134 --> 02:22:52.998]  I'm sure you get some calls yourself and start to question things that I don't think they questioned before.
[02:22:52.998 --> 02:22:57.642]  I think that's going to be the unfortunate legacy of the Obama administration.
[02:22:57.642 --> 02:23:02.646]  If distrust with government was bad before he got in, it is going to be absolutely epic.
[02:23:03.988 --> 02:23:07.291]  Sure, so things have gotten bad, but the worm is starting to turn.
[02:23:07.291 --> 02:23:14.417]  Lastly, how are you concerned that Obama will try to save his legacy, get his radical transformation of the republic through?
[02:23:14.417 --> 02:23:17.160]  Because you're right, he's dropping like a rock right now.
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:20.583]  I'm really concerned he might start a war, he might pull something.
[02:23:20.583 --> 02:23:24.447]  What does your gut and what does your intel tell you about the future of Obama?
[02:23:24.909 --> 02:23:26.771]  Well, it's a propaganda war, is what it is.
[02:23:26.771 --> 02:23:28.132]  He started it yesterday.
[02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:35.299]  I mean, why do you think he administratively and unconstitutionally wanted to turn the tide on this cancellation thing for your insurance?
[02:23:35.299 --> 02:23:39.483]  Because now he puts it back in the insurance company's lap knowing they can't go reverse this.
[02:23:39.483 --> 02:23:40.944]  They spent three years doing it.
[02:23:40.944 --> 02:23:42.886]  He wants them to reverse it in six weeks.
[02:23:42.886 --> 02:23:43.967]  And then what's he gonna say?
[02:23:43.967 --> 02:23:44.948]  Mark my words, first.
[02:23:45.248 --> 02:23:46.930]  Folks, you heard it here first.
[02:23:46.930 --> 02:23:49.753]  He is going to say in six weeks, look what the insurance companies did.
[02:23:49.753 --> 02:23:50.694]  They screwed you.
[02:23:50.694 --> 02:23:57.522]  I mean, that's a propaganda war that I would argue is even worse than some other kinds of actions he'd take.
[02:23:57.522 --> 02:24:04.309]  I mean, it really, really does significant damage to the American economy, the American psyche, trust in our government.
[02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:06.692]  This is really devastating stuff and it's very sad to watch.
[02:24:06.892 --> 02:24:10.513]  Well, Dan, you know a lot about criminology.
[02:24:10.513 --> 02:24:12.214]  I've read a lot of it just because it's so interesting.
[02:24:12.214 --> 02:24:19.977]  You know, actual criminology, not just the paperback crime novels and crime history stuff that's nonfiction.
[02:24:19.977 --> 02:24:25.439]  But good people tend to be blind to evil because we just don't think like that and can't imagine it.
[02:24:25.439 --> 02:24:30.581]  And that's why a woman will get in the yellow Volkswagen of Ted Bundy, you know, because he's wearing a nice suit.
[02:24:31.101 --> 02:24:44.548]  We have to learn that they're worse than we even think, and you look at Cloward and Pivot and the plan to socialize things and then make us become collectivized, and you figure out it really is a plan, and that's why they're so aggressive.
[02:24:44.548 --> 02:24:48.150]  I mean, at a gut level, you've been inside there, you know what's going on.
[02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:52.732]  They know this is a plan to bankrupt America and basically get everybody on the welfare rolls.
[02:24:53.291 --> 02:24:54.913]  Well, they can't not know.
[02:24:54.913 --> 02:24:57.756]  You'd have to not understand basic arithmetic.
[02:24:57.756 --> 02:25:09.550]  Their goal ultimately, the Keynesian principle in economics, their goal is ultimately to make government debt the only viable debt to take away the private sector for a way to develop capital for your business.
[02:25:09.550 --> 02:25:12.293]  Not to get overly wonkous, but that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[02:25:12.293 --> 02:25:12.734]  No, that's it.
[02:25:12.734 --> 02:25:13.475]  They want a monopoly.
[02:25:13.835 --> 02:25:15.516]  Right, but you can't have that, Alex.
[02:25:15.516 --> 02:25:17.837]  If you don't run debt, you can't issue bonds.
[02:25:17.837 --> 02:25:21.018]  If you can't issue bonds, then they have to get bonds from the private sector.
[02:25:21.018 --> 02:25:23.779]  IBM bonds, corporate bonds, stock equities.
[02:25:23.779 --> 02:25:24.539]  They don't want that.
[02:25:24.539 --> 02:25:38.364]  They see the private sector as inherently exploitative, as destroying the environment, so what they do is they run up these massive debts, despite the economic apocalypse we're looking at, because they only hope that they crowd out the private market, and your only avenue for investment
[02:25:39.024 --> 02:25:46.887]  And then they blame, and then they blame the capitalism, when this isn't capitalism, it's crony, insider capitalism with socialism.
[02:25:46.887 --> 02:25:51.949]  Well, I can tell you Secret Service guys get an education in economics, but you really need to get in Congress.
[02:25:51.949 --> 02:25:53.530]  Dan Bongino, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:25:53.530 --> 02:25:54.390]  When's the book coming out?
[02:25:54.841 --> 02:25:58.283]  It's available for pre-order now on Amazon, Life Inside the Bubble.
[02:25:58.283 --> 02:25:59.924]  You grab it, you'll get it in a couple days.
[02:25:59.924 --> 02:26:02.786]  But you're not allowed to talk about it until it actually comes out, though.
[02:26:02.786 --> 02:26:04.127]  Yeah, yeah, I promise.
[02:26:04.127 --> 02:26:05.648]  When does it officially come out?
[02:26:05.648 --> 02:26:07.729]  November 19th is the official release date.
[02:26:07.729 --> 02:26:07.990]  Okay, good.
[02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:09.010]  I think you're on that week.
[02:26:09.010 --> 02:26:11.752]  Alright, Dan, thanks for the time, and it's always great talking to you.
[02:26:11.752 --> 02:26:12.372]  You too, Alex.
[02:26:12.372 --> 02:26:12.873]  Take care, buddy.
[02:26:12.873 --> 02:26:14.074]  Wow, I like that guy.
[02:26:14.074 --> 02:26:15.955]  I really, that's a real guy.
[02:26:15.955 --> 02:26:19.257]  I can tell you right now, my gut just says that's a good guy right there.
[02:26:21.215 --> 02:26:22.637]  Oh, I wish there were.
[02:26:22.637 --> 02:26:25.661]  Yeah, well, we'll see what he does in Congress.
[02:26:25.661 --> 02:26:27.423]  And then maybe he bonds you down for president.
[02:26:27.423 --> 02:26:36.675]  Anyways, the point is, is that, is that, well look, when you know when the Republican establishment doesn't like him, that's a good sign.
[02:26:36.675 --> 02:26:36.955]  Right there.
[02:26:39.602 --> 02:26:42.425]  Look, if you care about your kids, you don't want to destroy the country.
[02:26:42.425 --> 02:26:44.406]  I mean, it really gets simple.
[02:26:44.406 --> 02:26:52.914]  And the reason the police and military are waking up is that they understand now that everybody can feel it, not just intellectually understand it, but feel it.
[02:26:52.914 --> 02:26:54.856]  We've got the devil looking over our shoulder.
[02:26:54.856 --> 02:26:57.138]  I mean, this is, you know, the willies.
[02:26:57.138 --> 02:26:59.080]  I mean, I think I'm getting chills right now.
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:04.185]  I just I think about how evil these people are and how creepy and how bad.
[02:27:05.689 --> 02:27:16.194]  And, you know, if I was in an alley and like two or three thugs were walking up on me, acting like they want to mug me, this has happened before I grew up in Dallas.
[02:27:16.194 --> 02:27:20.176]  I'm the type of guy that just immediately says, what, you want to rob me?
[02:27:20.176 --> 02:27:20.857]  Let's do it.
[02:27:20.857 --> 02:27:22.958]  And then they usually back off.
[02:27:22.958 --> 02:27:25.079]  And I'm actually at that point hoping they do something.
[02:27:26.448 --> 02:27:31.770]  And it's not that I'm looking for a fight or anything, it's just that's the only time I can really turn into Ben Graham is when I'm outnumbered.
[02:27:31.770 --> 02:27:37.752]  Then it's, man, I mean, it's like, I don't enjoy hurting people, but I do enjoy it when they're bullies.
[02:27:37.752 --> 02:27:40.433]  Then it's like, I want to kill them.
[02:27:40.433 --> 02:27:46.875]  And the issue here is, it's just a normal instinct of a man to not want to be pushed around.
[02:27:46.875 --> 02:27:51.116]  And to want to stand up for justice and stand up for the individual.
[02:27:51.116 --> 02:27:55.638]  And I just, I mean, look,
[02:27:57.182 --> 02:28:03.445]  I, when I was born, the Trilateral Commission had already existed for a year.
[02:28:03.445 --> 02:28:12.729]  And I was like four or five years old reading books about the, trying to read books about the Trilateral Commission, looking at the covers, you know, wanting to be able to read them.
[02:28:12.729 --> 02:28:21.032]  That's why I started reading so early, even though I wasn't good at math and other things, was because they didn't let me watch TV except for like PBS and Saturday morning cartoons.
[02:28:21.032 --> 02:28:25.334]  We didn't watch television except, you know, for that or, or maybe once a week gun smoke or something.
[02:28:26.659 --> 02:28:29.140]  And or my dad was out of town.
[02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:30.381]  My mom would let me stay up late.
[02:28:30.381 --> 02:28:32.922]  We watched John Wayne movies, but we didn't watch a lot of TV.
[02:28:32.922 --> 02:28:37.565]  We're talking three hours a week, not six, seven hours a day.
[02:28:37.565 --> 02:28:40.186]  And she'd watch the news while making dinner, a little TV in the kitchen.
[02:28:40.186 --> 02:28:42.868]  I remember that my dad bought a little color TV when I was like two or three and.
[02:28:43.851 --> 02:28:45.772]  Finally just broke last year.
[02:28:45.772 --> 02:28:46.712]  I'll get that thing fixed.
[02:28:46.712 --> 02:28:50.814]  The point is, is that, uh, still had it in the kitchen until about last year.
[02:28:50.814 --> 02:28:52.394]  It was like a more like a radio than by that.
[02:28:52.394 --> 02:28:54.235]  It didn't even, it didn't even light up.
[02:28:54.235 --> 02:29:01.558]  You just turn it on, you know, UHF VHS, you had it hooked up to cable, but, uh, how to get that TV fixed.
[02:29:01.558 --> 02:29:02.378]  They haven't thrown it out.
[02:29:02.378 --> 02:29:04.159]  There's like an heirloom man.
[02:29:04.159 --> 02:29:07.620]  The point is, is that, um, I don't know why I went off of that story.
[02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:08.941]  It wasn't telling stories about television.
[02:29:11.638 --> 02:29:12.718]  Oh, reading as a kid.
[02:29:12.718 --> 02:29:16.559]  So I would just look at the pictures in the books and read every book in the house.
[02:29:16.559 --> 02:29:17.379]  They had all these books.
[02:29:17.379 --> 02:29:23.341]  And I remember so early looking at Between Two Ages by Zbigniew Brzezinski and wanting to read it.
[02:29:23.341 --> 02:29:25.101]  Then I read it when I was like 10, didn't understand it.
[02:29:25.101 --> 02:29:27.182]  Read it when I was like 16, kind of understood it.
[02:29:27.182 --> 02:29:38.445]  And I think that's why I, growing up in college and just high school and everywhere, saw everything because I'd already read all the globalist handbooks that most PhD, you know, economics professors don't.
[02:29:39.125 --> 02:29:41.588]  I'm not bragging saying I'm some smart guy.
[02:29:41.588 --> 02:29:50.398]  It's that this stuff is there, it's real, and you try to warn people about it, they go, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, which is a crutch for their ignorance.
[02:29:50.398 --> 02:29:54.323]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.323 --> 02:29:57.006]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.770 --> 02:30:02.831]  I had tried everything.
[02:30:02.831 --> 02:30:08.313]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:30:08.313 --> 02:30:13.155]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:30:13.155 --> 02:30:19.538]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:30:19.998 --> 02:30:31.231]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:30:31.231 --> 02:30:35.715]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:30:35.715 --> 02:30:38.719]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[02:30:39.059 --> 02:30:41.961]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:30:41.961 --> 02:30:43.522]  Now that's results.

[02:31:01.755 --> 02:31:08.400]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:10.782]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[02:31:10.782 --> 02:31:11.242]  The U.S.
[02:31:11.242 --> 02:31:15.466]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[02:31:15.466 --> 02:31:18.428]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[02:31:18.428 --> 02:31:19.929]  They want that attack to come.
[02:31:19.929 --> 02:31:26.114]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[02:31:26.499 --> 02:31:29.161]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[02:31:29.161 --> 02:31:34.126]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[02:31:34.126 --> 02:31:41.572]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[02:31:41.872 --> 02:31:44.635]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[02:31:44.635 --> 02:31:47.738]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[02:32:00.814 --> 02:32:11.478]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:32:11.478 --> 02:32:13.539]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:32:13.539 --> 02:32:14.439]  Fluoride!
[02:32:14.439 --> 02:32:16.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:22.662]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:32:22.922 --> 02:32:27.847]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:32:27.847 --> 02:32:34.173]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:32:34.173 --> 02:32:36.595]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:32:36.595 --> 02:32:39.538]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:32:39.538 --> 02:32:42.901]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:32:43.021 --> 02:32:48.465]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:48.465 --> 02:32:53.549]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:33:23.692 --> 02:33:27.395]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.395 --> 02:33:32.900]  Generals gathered in their masses.
[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:35.282]  Just like witches at black masses.
[02:33:37.310 --> 02:33:40.271]  Alright, I said I'd take your phone calls on any subject.
[02:33:40.271 --> 02:33:42.772]  First-time callers, long-time callers, I don't care.
[02:33:42.772 --> 02:33:42.832]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:42.832 --> 02:33:42.892]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:42.892 --> 02:33:45.473]  And we're gonna go to your phone calls in about T-minus two minutes.
[02:33:53.069 --> 02:33:58.374]  Man, there is all this news I haven't even gotten to yet, but I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:58.374 --> 02:34:01.377]  with a Sunday transmission that's always good.
[02:34:01.377 --> 02:34:06.401]  That's a really good two hours informative because I have a day of semi-rest, if you can call it that.
[02:34:06.401 --> 02:34:14.509]  All I do is basically obsess over information and wish I was on air when I'm not on air, and then once I get on air, it's almost like psychologically exhausting to cover all this.
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:15.960]  We're good to go.
[02:34:37.260 --> 02:34:40.882]  I mean, let me tell you, when I was like 14 reading Nietzsche, I didn't understand it.
[02:34:40.882 --> 02:34:42.263]  But I understand it now when I read it.
[02:34:42.263 --> 02:34:45.065]  I don't agree with a lot of it now, but a lot of it is true.
[02:34:45.065 --> 02:34:50.468]  A lot of it's just basically repeated by other philosophers before him and plagiarized.
[02:34:50.468 --> 02:35:04.916]  But regardless, ladies and gentlemen, my point in getting into that whole babbling story, that haphazard story, was that
[02:35:06.892 --> 02:35:19.217]  Those of us that have researched this know it's real and know it's on record and incredibly important and is governing our planet and taking us to a very, very bad place.
[02:35:19.217 --> 02:35:21.218]  And I think it's that book.
[02:35:21.218 --> 02:35:23.539]  I haven't read that book in over a decade.
[02:35:23.539 --> 02:35:27.040]  I haven't read that since I was like 23 or something.
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:28.381]  Between two ages.
[02:35:28.381 --> 02:35:31.922]  America's role in the technotronic era.
[02:35:31.922 --> 02:35:33.543]  And the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:35:33.543 --> 02:35:36.324]  I have read that whole book because it's short by Quigley.
[02:35:37.648 --> 02:35:40.409]  I haven't read the entire 1,100-page Tragedy and Hope.
[02:35:40.409 --> 02:35:42.030]  I've scanned through the bibliography.
[02:35:42.030 --> 02:35:43.410]  Probably read 500, 600 pages of it.
[02:35:43.410 --> 02:35:44.610]  I don't know.
[02:35:44.610 --> 02:35:49.052]  But you read all this and they're like, yes, we run the drugs and control organized crime.
[02:35:49.052 --> 02:35:51.453]  That way we control it and make sure it isn't out of control.
[02:35:51.453 --> 02:35:55.014]  It's like the scene in The Godfather where they're around the commission table.
[02:35:55.014 --> 02:35:56.755]  We're gonna deal drugs, but we're gonna control it.
[02:35:56.755 --> 02:35:58.195]  It's always like an excuse.
[02:35:58.195 --> 02:35:59.676]  These people are a joke.
[02:36:00.421 --> 02:36:04.482]  We're going to run the white slavery so we can control how many kids get kidnapped.
[02:36:04.482 --> 02:36:07.363]  We'll kill or arrest anybody else that tries to grab kids.
[02:36:07.363 --> 02:36:11.103]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:36:11.103 --> 02:36:20.045]  I didn't kill, you know, 30% of the population in Cambodia, but I funded and allowed the communists to do it.
[02:36:20.045 --> 02:36:24.326]  That's basically a quote or paraphrase quote of Brzezinski in one of his books.
[02:36:24.326 --> 02:36:27.307]  I mean, I went and bought his book that came out earlier this year and I couldn't read it.
[02:36:28.166 --> 02:36:32.811]  I mean, I scanned through the bibliography, probably read about 50 pages of it.
[02:36:32.811 --> 02:36:38.517]  And when I went to get it, there was some, like, trendy professor type that didn't know who I was, already getting one.
[02:36:38.517 --> 02:36:40.278]  I was like, oh, you're reading this?
[02:36:40.278 --> 02:36:42.861]  And I think it's like, what's Persenti's new book?
[02:36:42.861 --> 02:36:46.785]  The Five Things, the Five Most Important Things, or whatever it is.
[02:36:46.785 --> 02:36:51.170]  And it's all written for the public, you know, like, semi-trendies that think they know everything.
[02:36:51.775 --> 02:36:55.578]  But the number one deal is take down the alternative media, shut down freedom.
[02:36:55.578 --> 02:36:57.519]  He tells the elite, we're in trouble.
[02:36:57.519 --> 02:37:01.482]  It's like he said three years ago to the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:37:01.482 --> 02:37:09.267]  And it's just so frustrating to then go on national shows and they go, you believe there's a CFR?
[02:37:09.267 --> 02:37:11.069]  I remember being on national TV.
[02:37:12.652 --> 02:37:21.298]  Yeah, like 96, 97, 98, where they would say Jones believes there's a trilateral commission and believes there's a CFR.
[02:37:21.298 --> 02:37:32.064]  If you're a talk radio listener, you remember major talk show host with their kook detector saying it didn't exist, then it didn't have any power and wasn't important.
[02:37:32.064 --> 02:37:35.727]  There it is, strategic vision, America and the crisis of global power.
[02:37:35.727 --> 02:37:38.929]  When I was first offered a big national syndicated job for
[02:37:40.938 --> 02:37:43.879]  15, 20 times more than I was making at the time.
[02:37:43.879 --> 02:37:51.820]  They told me, no more CFR, no more fellow reserve, no more black helicopters, no more RAND Corporation, no more military trained to take the guns.
[02:37:51.820 --> 02:38:04.122]  You're going to be a mainline Republican, you're going to have producers, they're going to do it all for you, you reach right through the radio, you'll be the next Rush Limbaugh, are you ready?
[02:38:04.122 --> 02:38:07.183]  And I was like, I can't even talk if I'm not telling the truth.
[02:38:07.183 --> 02:38:09.623]  I can't go on air and BS people for five seconds.
[02:38:11.169 --> 02:38:15.950]  I can't lie even when lying would help me.
[02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:18.990]  I had a cop.
[02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:19.911]  See, I can't help it.
[02:38:19.911 --> 02:38:22.991]  I had a cop come over about five years ago and he goes, have you been drinking?
[02:38:22.991 --> 02:38:24.752]  And I went, yeah, I had a glass of red wine.
[02:38:24.752 --> 02:38:25.552]  Big deal.
[02:38:25.552 --> 02:38:27.112]  He's like, Alex, why are you saying that?
[02:38:27.112 --> 02:38:28.652]  This is all, just get out of here.
[02:38:28.652 --> 02:38:31.993]  Just get out of here.
[02:38:31.993 --> 02:38:36.874]  I mean, you know, the point is, is that it's just, I'm not doing anything wrong.
[02:38:36.874 --> 02:38:37.614]  Leave me alone.
[02:38:38.562 --> 02:38:39.102]  I'm good.
[02:38:39.102 --> 02:38:40.763]  I'm a decent person.
[02:38:40.763 --> 02:38:41.744]  You're a decent person.
[02:38:41.744 --> 02:38:43.665]  You want justice.
[02:38:43.665 --> 02:38:46.106]  We need to be on the same side together against tyranny.
[02:38:46.106 --> 02:38:47.226]  We need to stick together.
[02:38:47.226 --> 02:38:49.087]  We need to support each other.
[02:38:49.087 --> 02:38:51.008]  We need to come together for liberty, folks.
[02:38:51.008 --> 02:38:55.130]  We don't want to do this to our kids, our nephews, our nieces, even if you don't have kids.
[02:38:55.130 --> 02:38:56.551]  Other people, you have goodwill for them.
[02:38:57.799 --> 02:39:03.361]  You know, if you knew that a bridge was washed out and you've just seen a car caught in it and pulled into the water.
[02:39:03.361 --> 02:39:05.001]  I've actually seen that happen before.
[02:39:05.001 --> 02:39:06.982]  You're driving back to see other cars coming.
[02:39:06.982 --> 02:39:08.682]  You tell them, hey, don't try to cross there.
[02:39:08.682 --> 02:39:11.283]  The fire department just fished some lady out.
[02:39:11.283 --> 02:39:12.783]  It's really bad.
[02:39:12.783 --> 02:39:15.764]  It's not some goody-two-shoes thing.
[02:39:15.764 --> 02:39:19.305]  It's an instinct to want to help people.
[02:39:19.305 --> 02:39:20.666]  Like, I've walked out of a restaurant before.
[02:39:20.666 --> 02:39:21.286]  It was terrible.
[02:39:21.286 --> 02:39:22.666]  And I go, hey, don't go in there.
[02:39:22.666 --> 02:39:23.387]  Terrible service.
[02:39:23.387 --> 02:39:24.427]  Food tastes like crap.
[02:39:27.557 --> 02:39:31.822]  Now if the place has got good food, I'll tell people, hey man, you gotta try this place over here.
[02:39:31.822 --> 02:39:32.763]  It is awesome.
[02:39:32.763 --> 02:39:35.647]  But the trendies I meet, they go, don't tell people this is good.
[02:39:35.647 --> 02:39:36.868]  We don't want a crowd here.
[02:39:36.868 --> 02:39:40.813]  We want this for ourselves.
[02:39:40.813 --> 02:39:41.553]  It's amazing.
[02:39:41.553 --> 02:39:42.595]  I'll shut up and go to your calls.
[02:39:43.919 --> 02:39:46.160]  Well, I tell you, Julio is Johnny on the spot.
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:48.602]  He's reported off and on for Infowars over the years.
[02:39:48.602 --> 02:39:52.865]  I think he's got his degree, or he's about to get his degree in journalism up in Chicago.
[02:39:52.865 --> 02:39:57.608]  He's broken a lot of big stories, and I met him up at Bilderberg two years ago, covering it in Virginia.
[02:39:57.608 --> 02:40:05.793]  And Julio, I thought when I said, anybody can call in, first-time callers, usually y'all can call in, I thought, I bet Julio's the first one out of the gate.
[02:40:05.793 --> 02:40:07.774]  And man, he's Johnny on the spot.
[02:40:07.774 --> 02:40:10.896]  Julio from New York City, I guess, or maybe it's a different Julio.
[02:40:12.057 --> 02:40:13.198]  It's a different Julio.
[02:40:13.198 --> 02:40:15.819]  I didn't look at the... I was wrong!
[02:40:15.819 --> 02:40:19.022]  I thought Julio would be the first caller, and it's not our reporter.
[02:40:19.022 --> 02:40:19.462]  I didn't look.
[02:40:19.462 --> 02:40:20.603]  It said New York.
[02:40:20.603 --> 02:40:21.663]  That's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:40:21.663 --> 02:40:23.985]  So Julio from Chicago didn't get in.
[02:40:23.985 --> 02:40:25.206]  I don't know this Julio.
[02:40:25.206 --> 02:40:26.086]  Julio, go ahead.
[02:40:26.086 --> 02:40:28.868]  No, I'm Julio from New York.
[02:40:28.868 --> 02:40:29.929]  Are you listening to me?
[02:40:29.929 --> 02:40:31.490]  Yes, I am, sir.
[02:40:31.490 --> 02:40:32.510]  Okay.
[02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:35.872]  And I want to thank you for waking me up.
[02:40:35.872 --> 02:40:37.113]  It's the first time I call.
[02:40:37.113 --> 02:40:38.614]  I finally get through.
[02:40:38.614 --> 02:40:40.796]  I've been listening to you for the last...
[02:40:42.196 --> 02:40:43.797]  Join the club, brother!
[02:41:12.521 --> 02:41:16.946]  Because we've always been told that cholesterol is bad for you, you have to eat low fat.
[02:41:16.946 --> 02:41:20.630]  And now, science is saying that, no.
[02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:22.792]  In reality, those studies were flawed.
[02:41:22.792 --> 02:41:23.172]  No, no, no.
[02:41:23.172 --> 02:41:29.339]  Your brain, your brain, the solid part of it for medical doctors, like 70% of your brain is water, as you know.
[02:41:29.339 --> 02:41:31.621]  But the part that isn't is like 90% cholesterol.
[02:41:33.581 --> 02:41:39.046]  Now, it's an electrochemical computer, and I knew this from my uncle who was in a motorcycle accident.
[02:41:39.046 --> 02:41:41.008]  He stopped having almost all his seizures.
[02:41:41.008 --> 02:41:42.589]  The medication wouldn't do it.
[02:41:42.589 --> 02:41:49.195]  Twenty-something years ago, they said start eating a fish oil, fat diet, and coconut oil.
[02:41:49.195 --> 02:41:50.776]  They knew all that.
[02:41:50.776 --> 02:41:51.997]  I take coconut oil in the morning.
[02:41:51.997 --> 02:41:53.018]  I mean, it's a brain booster.
[02:41:53.018 --> 02:41:53.599]  It's amazing.
[02:41:55.347 --> 02:42:01.951]  They knew all this, so what's bad is trans fats and burned fat, and then all these artificial fats.
[02:42:01.951 --> 02:42:12.198]  But they tell you, don't get fat, eat this artificial fat, the artificial margarine, that you might as well put super glue in your arteries and veins.
[02:42:12.198 --> 02:42:15.580]  I mean, you might as well just shoot yourself in the heart with a shotgun, eating that.
[02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:18.342]  So see, everything they tell you to do is meant to kill you.
[02:42:18.342 --> 02:42:18.602]  Go ahead.
[02:42:20.117 --> 02:42:22.399]  Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.
[02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:27.142]  And all the sugar, you know, I'm trying not to eat GMOs, but it's so difficult not to.
[02:42:27.142 --> 02:42:28.763]  It's everywhere.
[02:42:28.763 --> 02:42:29.403]  It's everywhere.
[02:42:29.403 --> 02:42:33.506]  Sir, they want to put statins in the water now.
[02:42:33.506 --> 02:42:40.391]  And statins, on record, shut your liver off and basically make you start getting Alzheimer's and rot your eyeballs out.
[02:42:40.391 --> 02:42:43.753]  Major studies, statin drugs significantly increase risk of cataracts.
[02:42:43.753 --> 02:42:45.935]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:42:45.935 --> 02:42:49.157]  I mean, it literally gets rid of the oil lubricant of your body.
[02:42:50.233 --> 02:42:52.977]  What you don't want is burned red meat.
[02:42:52.977 --> 02:42:55.161]  That is a death sentence, and God do I love it.
[02:42:55.161 --> 02:42:55.922]  Oh man, I tell ya.
[02:42:58.703 --> 02:43:01.945]  But, I mean, of all the natural stuff, you don't want burned red meat.
[02:43:01.945 --> 02:43:11.471]  But, I mean, you want fish oil, and you want fish, and you want chicken, and you want coconut oil, and you want other good vegetable oils, and you gotta have it.
[02:43:11.471 --> 02:43:18.796]  I mean, I don't know how many old people I know that literally have Alzheimer's, which is really just brain scurvy, and they've got rotholes in their skin and everything.
[02:43:18.796 --> 02:43:26.561]  You put them on coconut oil, you put them on vitamins and minerals, they're suddenly back, and their doctor always says, take them off of that.
[02:43:26.561 --> 02:43:27.182]  Take them off!
[02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:31.191]  Then it's bye-bye, old person!
[02:43:31.191 --> 02:43:35.833]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[02:43:35.833 --> 02:43:37.234]  I was listening to a show yesterday.
[02:43:37.234 --> 02:43:39.274]  I was on a call, I just couldn't get through.
[02:43:39.274 --> 02:43:56.321]  I wanted to ask the last guest about the alien theory, because I was listening to you, and you always had Jim Mars on, and then I started searching and started listening to Jim Mars, and then I stopped listening to him because I got freaked out, because this guy is saying 10 truths,
[02:43:58.629 --> 02:44:00.429]  But they chose you one big lie!
[02:44:00.429 --> 02:44:03.630]  Yeah, you know, I think Jim's a really reasonable, genuine guy.
[02:44:03.630 --> 02:44:17.853]  He has been, as a real reporter, you know, a crime reporter and then also a professor and everything, he's done a lot of research and he knows, I mean, there are astronauts, you know, footage of them going, oh, there's a craft outside and then the government won't say what it is.
[02:44:17.853 --> 02:44:18.634]  We don't know.
[02:44:18.634 --> 02:44:21.674]  I don't go there because it can't be proven one way or the other.
[02:44:21.674 --> 02:44:24.015]  I know about the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[02:44:24.895 --> 02:44:28.417]  But I can't get people to admit FEMA camps exist when it's public.
[02:44:28.417 --> 02:44:29.518]  So I don't know.
[02:44:29.518 --> 02:44:29.978]  I don't know.
[02:44:29.978 --> 02:44:32.019]  I mean, I think the Bible's got it right.
[02:44:32.019 --> 02:44:35.561]  You know, there's demons and bad guys and there's angels.
[02:44:35.561 --> 02:44:37.622]  And there's a good guy that runs the angels.
[02:44:37.622 --> 02:44:39.843]  And I want to be with those guys.
[02:44:39.843 --> 02:44:44.806]  Because every culture says the fallen angels like to murder babies and stuff.
[02:44:44.806 --> 02:44:46.587]  And historically this stuff goes, you know.
[02:44:46.587 --> 02:44:47.788]  So I don't know what's going on.
[02:44:47.788 --> 02:44:49.969]  But there's something to all the wives' tales is my point.
[02:44:50.749 --> 02:44:52.709]  And, uh, I don't know.
[02:44:52.709 --> 02:44:53.850]  So God bless you.
[02:44:53.850 --> 02:44:55.310]  I know Jim Mars very well.
[02:44:55.310 --> 02:44:58.651]  I think he's a really good guy and I don't think he's lying to people.
[02:44:58.651 --> 02:45:04.632]  I think he really genuinely believes that, uh, there is, uh, you know, a lot of stuff going on.
[02:45:04.632 --> 02:45:07.453]  We don't know about which undoubtedly there is, but I don't go there.
[02:45:07.453 --> 02:45:13.814]  I don't go there because let me tell you, if I ever see a flying saucer and an alien, I'm going to tell you about it.
[02:45:13.814 --> 02:45:15.454]  I promise you.
[02:45:15.454 --> 02:45:17.895]  Um, my uncle, uh,
[02:45:19.704 --> 02:45:45.771]  Before his motorcycle accident, was walking from one farmhouse to the other about 200 yards to get another set of dominoes and saw three, this is like in the early 60s, he was like 12 years old, saw three craft the color of Mother of Pearl, just like in the movies, green, blue, orange, rainbow, with no sound come up from behind the trees about 500 yards away.
[02:45:45.771 --> 02:45:46.831]  She showed me many times.
[02:45:46.831 --> 02:45:48.932]  Every time we walk up there at night, he goes, you know what I saw over there?
[02:45:50.151 --> 02:45:54.512]  And he came running in and told people, I just saw something really weird.
[02:45:54.512 --> 02:45:55.633]  Who knows what it is?
[02:45:55.633 --> 02:45:56.973]  I don't know.
[02:45:56.973 --> 02:45:57.894]  People see this stuff.
[02:45:57.894 --> 02:45:59.814]  Every culture saw it.
[02:45:59.814 --> 02:46:11.618]  They've got Aztec carvings of 747s with windows down the sides and perfect proportional engines on them that were in the Spanish Museum 400 years ago.
[02:46:11.618 --> 02:46:13.899]  I mean, I don't know what that is.
[02:46:13.899 --> 02:46:15.259]  Did they foresee the future?
[02:46:15.259 --> 02:46:17.160]  Did a time gate open up?
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:17.680]  I don't know.
[02:46:18.922 --> 02:46:22.424]  I mean, I don't cover aliens and stuff, and the media says I do.
[02:46:22.424 --> 02:46:23.644]  So, I just don't go there.
[02:46:23.644 --> 02:46:24.405]  We gotta move quick now.
[02:46:24.405 --> 02:46:25.325]  I said I'd give each caller a minute.
[02:46:25.325 --> 02:46:26.686]  Let's give that guy five minutes.
[02:46:26.686 --> 02:46:28.066]  Andrew in Massachusetts.
[02:46:28.066 --> 02:46:29.847]  Go ahead.
[02:46:29.847 --> 02:46:30.808]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:46:30.808 --> 02:46:31.568]  Good, brother.
[02:46:31.568 --> 02:46:33.269]  Just wanted to thank you for your work.
[02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:34.289]  Also, I thought it was funny.
[02:46:34.289 --> 02:46:39.372]  I've called in once before, and Julio was on right before me, so I thought that was kind of a coincidence.
[02:46:39.372 --> 02:46:40.493]  How about another Julio?
[02:46:40.493 --> 02:46:41.013]  Real quick.
[02:46:42.369 --> 02:46:47.792]  I write for Intellihub.com, and I'm actually helping to organize a nationwide protest.
[02:46:47.792 --> 02:46:51.454]  It's going to take place tomorrow, and it's called the March Against the Mainstreet Media.
[02:46:51.454 --> 02:46:52.974]  Have you heard anything about it?
[02:46:52.974 --> 02:46:58.337]  You know, I follow routinely the Intellihub's info.
[02:46:58.337 --> 02:46:59.437]  Some really good reports over there.
[02:46:59.437 --> 02:47:03.059]  We carry some of it, but I was not aware of that.
[02:47:03.059 --> 02:47:10.963]  Yeah, so if your viewers want to get involved, they can go to MAMSM.info, and they can find the event locations, basically.
[02:47:11.796 --> 02:47:18.498]  We're going to go in front of studio headquarters of all the mainstream media outlets and we're going to protest and expose the lies.
[02:47:18.498 --> 02:47:19.418]  I agree.
[02:47:19.418 --> 02:47:21.898]  I did that many times a long time ago.
[02:47:21.898 --> 02:47:23.879]  We would go protest local and national media.
[02:47:23.879 --> 02:47:27.480]  I got arrested protesting at Fox News with Geraldo Rivera.
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:30.380]  I just happened to be the guy that did a live broadcast outside so I took advantage of it.
[02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:31.681]  Nothing against Geraldo.
[02:47:31.681 --> 02:47:34.201]  He's a listener of the show and comes on and stuff.
[02:47:34.201 --> 02:47:37.242]  But that was obviously before that.
[02:47:37.242 --> 02:47:40.023]  But I think it's a great idea to point out there's state-run media.
[02:47:40.023 --> 02:47:40.543]  God bless you.
[02:47:41.323 --> 02:47:42.544]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:42.544 --> 02:47:45.625]  We'll look into that and maybe post something on InfoWars about it.
[02:47:45.625 --> 02:47:48.687]  Rob in Oregon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:47:48.687 --> 02:47:50.888]  Alex Jones, hey, real pleasure to talk to you.
[02:47:50.888 --> 02:47:55.291]  I know you don't like thanks, but you need it and you deserve it.
[02:47:55.291 --> 02:48:06.357]  And, you know, kind of embarrassed to say, was one of those guys that football was kind of the biggest deal in all my buddies' fantasy football rules their lives.
[02:48:06.357 --> 02:48:07.558]  It's pretty sad.
[02:48:07.558 --> 02:48:09.899]  They ought to be like fantasy business development.
[02:48:10.836 --> 02:48:12.157]  Or Fantasy Manhood!
[02:48:12.157 --> 02:48:15.399]  How about Fantasy World?
[02:48:15.399 --> 02:48:18.540]  You know, it's just amazing.
[02:48:18.540 --> 02:48:23.063]  All these guys who wear jerseys around and just put these guys in a spotlight.
[02:48:23.063 --> 02:48:24.944]  They all have a goddamn look, I'm sorry.
[02:48:24.944 --> 02:48:27.305]  All have an Alex Jones jersey on.
[02:48:27.305 --> 02:48:28.426]  It's just amazing to me.
[02:48:28.426 --> 02:48:32.869]  But I had a question about, excuse me, the CCP in Oregon.
[02:48:33.954 --> 02:48:34.634]  I'm going to do it.
[02:48:34.634 --> 02:48:37.115]  I'm not a big gun guy, but I'm obviously listening to you.
[02:48:37.115 --> 02:48:38.896]  I'm well prepared now.
[02:48:38.896 --> 02:48:42.497]  Is there some sort of, you know, is it a good idea to get on that list?
[02:48:42.497 --> 02:48:44.758]  Am I going to be a target if I'm on that list?
[02:48:44.758 --> 02:48:51.120]  You know, you halfway waive your rights or something that's already inherently there, but they leave you alone with a concealed carry.
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:53.681]  And at this point, I say, let them all have you on a list.
[02:48:54.481 --> 02:48:56.704]  Uh, be, be, be public about everything.
[02:48:56.704 --> 02:49:04.013]  Uh, you know, I mean, if it makes them leave you alone more, and I have learned with police, they know you've all been checked out, background, everything.
[02:49:04.013 --> 02:49:08.559]  You know, it tends to be like, this person's not a criminal card, so it has some benefits.
[02:49:08.559 --> 02:49:10.301]  I mean, it sticks one way, half a dozen another.
[02:49:10.301 --> 02:49:11.382]  Uh, but...
[02:49:12.583 --> 02:49:14.385]  I don't know specifics on Oregon laws.
[02:49:14.385 --> 02:49:17.909]  I know they're mixed because I've looked at them before, but I don't remember the specifics.
[02:49:17.909 --> 02:49:19.750]  But you decide what you need to do.
[02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:23.854]  We got the laws changed so they don't harass you for having a handgun in your car anymore.
[02:49:23.854 --> 02:49:34.245]  Used to, you only had to carry a rifle around in Texas because they would try to put you in jail for that because the law was written in an ambiguous way just like Florida, where they're trying to change the law again.
[02:49:34.245 --> 02:49:35.806]  So the answer is move for open.
[02:49:36.667 --> 02:49:47.476]  Carry without permit, because criminals are going to carry anyways, or for concealed carry without permit, while working within the laws of your system and not get snared in their program.
[02:49:47.476 --> 02:49:48.357]  Does that sound reasonable?
[02:49:50.104 --> 02:49:58.390]  One quick thing, a caller called in yesterday and I'm not sure if I'm on the same page here but I'm trying to sell this to people who think I'm out of my mind and I don't know how you do it.
[02:49:58.390 --> 02:50:04.734]  You ought to offer counseling services because I've never been more awake and I don't know how you deal with what you know.
[02:50:04.734 --> 02:50:13.901]  But when they sell this to people it'd be nice on the site, and I'd do this for you if I could, but to get like some sort of glossary because it seems like an analogy would be you see
[02:50:14.361 --> 02:50:19.183]  Liberty may be at the end of this tunnel, but there's so many landmines and grenades.
[02:50:19.183 --> 02:50:40.533]  Yeah, that'd be a great video game where you've got to go through the last 5,000 years of tyranny and how governments try to control you, and then you get into more advanced forms, and then you finally get to land of liberty and you learn it's about you being an individual, being honorable with other honorable people, and everybody who's honorable going after people that aren't honorable in a human intelligence network of liberty.
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:42.661]  That's what it's all about.
[02:50:42.661 --> 02:50:46.864]  Always reaching for more freedom, more humanity, more empowerment.
[02:50:46.864 --> 02:50:48.946]  Always battling tyranny.
[02:50:48.946 --> 02:50:50.307]  I mean, really, it's a process.
[02:50:50.307 --> 02:50:53.849]  And then the destination is the journey.
[02:50:53.849 --> 02:50:55.831]  Destination, humanity.
[02:50:55.831 --> 02:50:56.992]  Destination, honor.
[02:50:56.992 --> 02:50:58.573]  Destination, good.
[02:50:58.573 --> 02:50:59.253]  Destination, God.
[02:51:01.397 --> 02:51:05.059]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:51:05.059 --> 02:51:08.880]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:51:08.880 --> 02:51:15.063]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:51:15.063 --> 02:51:25.288]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:51:25.288 --> 02:51:29.730]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 probiotic from Terragonics.

[02:54:06.104 --> 02:54:10.066]  It's been a power-packed week of resistance against tyranny.
[02:54:10.066 --> 02:54:13.248]  The House has passed a bill to keep your insurance.
[02:54:13.248 --> 02:54:15.589]  Obama has vowed to veto it.
[02:54:15.589 --> 02:54:24.553]  While promising you that somewhere down the line he'll let you not get your insurance cancelled while millions every few days are getting cancelled.
[02:54:24.553 --> 02:54:25.934]  Are getting notice of cancellation.
[02:54:26.701 --> 02:54:30.863]  And he's like, I'll fix it, just, I mean, it's a classic con artist game.
[02:54:30.863 --> 02:54:34.945]  Like a carnival where it's a rigged game, or almost impossible to win.
[02:54:34.945 --> 02:54:37.566]  They're like, oh, don't be a wimp, just stay in the game.
[02:54:37.566 --> 02:54:40.328]  You're gonna, you're gonna make it.
[02:54:40.328 --> 02:54:44.490]  I told you before it happened, it'd be like the Nigerian email scam.
[02:54:44.490 --> 02:54:45.890]  I just know how they work.
[02:54:45.890 --> 02:54:48.251]  It's, it's, that's what's so frustrating.
[02:54:51.087 --> 02:54:54.348]  Wow, just really amazing to see that.
[02:54:54.348 --> 02:54:57.149]  And meanwhile, the Democrats have turned on Obamacare.
[02:54:57.149 --> 02:55:00.230]  The Washington Times is reporting.
[02:55:00.230 --> 02:55:11.074]  By the way, Don Salazar just showed me an article he has from the new Xbox that literally, I told you it sees through all your walls and scans and maps your whole house for the NSA on record.
[02:55:11.074 --> 02:55:14.496]  I mean, Microsoft is the NSA.
[02:55:14.496 --> 02:55:15.516]  They're even worse than Google.
[02:55:17.622 --> 02:55:22.924]  I love how Google tattles on themselves and goes, oh, NSA spying's up three times, our system shows.
[02:55:22.924 --> 02:55:23.484]  Oh, really?
[02:55:23.484 --> 02:55:28.086]  It's like Darth Vader reporting on Emperor Palpatine or something.
[02:55:28.086 --> 02:55:34.689]  Well, now, and I don't even, I mean, these are on mainstream news articles, but nobody's pointing it out.
[02:55:36.411 --> 02:55:37.292]  Yeah, yeah, don't show it.
[02:55:37.292 --> 02:55:39.353]  Don't, because it's about to show it.
[02:55:39.353 --> 02:55:44.697]  You can see a guy in the room with the Xbox, and you see his package, everything.
[02:55:44.697 --> 02:55:46.959]  It's worse than the naked body scanners.
[02:55:46.959 --> 02:55:58.387]  Because that's all those are, is they fire out basically high-powered radio waves, like sonar or radar, and then it bounces back, and then it gets a feed off of how they bounce back.
[02:55:58.387 --> 02:56:02.491]  And so it's a black and white image of everything.
[02:56:03.453 --> 02:56:05.434]  And so here's the big news, and we're going to break this.
[02:56:05.434 --> 02:56:07.416]  This is child porn.
[02:56:07.416 --> 02:56:18.523]  I guarantee you, that's why they've had to not scan people under 18 in a lot of the airports and at courthouses, as people started suing them, going, it's child porn, because they're saving the images.
[02:56:18.523 --> 02:56:26.349]  And of course, they'll show like some blotchy image where they don't tune the machine right and go, oh, look, that doesn't see anything, and then lie to the public.
[02:56:27.261 --> 02:56:27.741]  We're good to go.
[02:56:50.526 --> 02:57:03.834]  The PERV government, you know, is setting all this up with a literal imperial probe droid you pay $500 for, or whatever it is, that you go buy at Walmart, scanning your house and tracking everything you do with audio.
[02:57:03.834 --> 02:57:04.914]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:57:04.914 --> 02:57:10.978]  I mean, and they've had top psychologists come out and say the TSA groping of children is pedophilia training.
[02:57:10.978 --> 02:57:18.042]  So we're going to have the headline out that new Xbox will empower and enable child pornography.
[02:57:19.465 --> 02:57:23.407]  The new Xbox will produce, in mass, child pornography.
[02:57:23.407 --> 02:57:31.471]  And people, all the time, will get in, people will let them into their Xbox, they'll go into that feature, and I mean, that's incredible.
[02:57:31.471 --> 02:57:34.512]  And again, that's the new attitude, it's a big deal!
[02:57:34.512 --> 02:57:36.913]  You know the UN's come out?
[02:57:36.913 --> 02:57:41.676]  The big psychological association came out this week, and said now pedophilia's okay?
[02:57:42.793 --> 02:57:43.534]  Did you see?
[02:57:43.534 --> 02:57:44.214]  I didn't cover that.
[02:57:44.214 --> 02:57:45.656]  That was out Monday.
[02:57:45.656 --> 02:57:49.500]  I think it's the American Psychological Association.
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:50.261]  I don't want to get it wrong.
[02:57:50.261 --> 02:57:51.642]  There's like three of those groups.
[02:57:51.642 --> 02:57:53.364]  But the big one came out.
[02:57:53.364 --> 02:57:57.228]  And then in the official medical book, they said, no, pedophilia is good.
[02:57:57.228 --> 02:57:59.130]  There's nothing wrong with it.
[02:57:59.130 --> 02:58:01.672]  And when you get down to it, these people are sick.
[02:58:01.672 --> 02:58:02.753]  Of course it's wrong.
[02:58:02.753 --> 02:58:03.795]  Of course it's evil.
[02:58:03.795 --> 02:58:04.936]  You deserve to be executed.
[02:58:06.172 --> 02:58:07.754]  They're not gonna stop.
[02:58:07.754 --> 02:58:08.255]  The U.N.
[02:58:08.255 --> 02:58:23.055]  accepts NAMBLA and says they should be allowed, and your child at age 5 should be able to give consent for some pot-bellied, degenerate, toothless person with a huge mustache to pick your kid up at the bus stop and then take him on, you know what they do.
[02:58:24.451 --> 02:58:29.973]  Ladies and gentlemen, these degenerates want you to show brain damage from all the halogens in the water you can't fight back.
[02:58:29.973 --> 02:58:32.334]  What I do is Survival Shield nascent iodine.
[02:58:32.334 --> 02:58:32.794]  Incredible.
[02:58:32.794 --> 02:58:33.694]  We have it in stock.
[02:58:33.694 --> 02:58:35.515]  The proprietary only brand.
[02:58:35.515 --> 02:58:37.215]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:37.215 --> 02:58:39.276]  Survival Shield from Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:41.397 --> 02:58:42.518]  Oh, by the way, I almost forgot.
[02:58:42.518 --> 02:58:46.141]  20% off on all the ProPure water filtration systems.
[02:58:46.141 --> 02:58:47.542]  I'm doing some overdrive.
[02:58:47.542 --> 02:58:50.184]  I'm coming back at Infowars.com for its last show.
[02:58:50.184 --> 02:58:51.184]  I can't help it.
[02:58:51.184 --> 02:58:54.207]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:58:54.207 --> 02:58:59.231]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:58:59.231 --> 02:59:06.396]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:59:06.536 --> 02:59:12.161]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:59:12.161 --> 02:59:16.205]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:59:16.205 --> 02:59:20.929]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:59:20.929 --> 02:59:26.134]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:59:26.374 --> 02:59:29.615]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[02:59:29.615 --> 02:59:32.116]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:59:32.116 --> 02:59:36.878]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:59:36.878 --> 02:59:39.759]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.

[02:59:46.982 --> 02:59:48.243]  We're getting prepared.
[02:59:48.243 --> 02:59:48.903]  Are you?
[02:59:48.903 --> 02:59:49.703]  Infowarshop.com
[02:59:52.082 --> 02:59:55.665]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.665 --> 02:59:58.867]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.973 --> 03:00:10.816]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.816 --> 03:00:12.397]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.397 --> 03:00:13.958]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.958 --> 03:00:18.141]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.141 --> 03:00:22.223]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:44.062 --> 03:00:45.383]  And this is Obamacare right here.
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:16.902]  And if you're a radio listener, basically it's a rigged game.
[03:01:16.902 --> 03:01:20.745]  I mean it's all a rigged game and there was immigration reform ads on there.
[03:01:20.745 --> 03:01:26.169]  Which means open the borders up, give everybody free health care, bankrupt the country faster.
[03:01:26.169 --> 03:01:28.250]  Except citizens, they don't get anything.
[03:01:28.250 --> 03:01:30.312]  What a boot, kicking him in the face.
[03:01:30.312 --> 03:01:32.694]  Scott in Connecticut, you're on the air, go ahead sir.
[03:01:34.446 --> 03:01:35.566]  Yes, hi Alex.
[03:01:35.566 --> 03:01:36.667]  It's good to talk to you.
[03:01:36.667 --> 03:01:37.427]  Thanks, Ken.
[03:01:37.427 --> 03:01:40.988]  I just wanted to say thank you for waking me up in June of this year.
[03:01:40.988 --> 03:01:42.828]  And I grow all the vegetables.
[03:01:42.828 --> 03:01:44.109]  But here's what's bothering me.
[03:01:44.109 --> 03:01:47.710]  The chemtrails are like really bugging me.
[03:01:47.710 --> 03:01:52.551]  I know it's a minor issue, but it's not that minor anymore to me.
[03:01:52.551 --> 03:01:54.932]  You know, the aluminum and all that.
[03:01:54.932 --> 03:01:55.772]  They're spewing out.
[03:01:55.772 --> 03:01:59.553]  So being brain damaged and being softly, lovingly killed,
[03:02:00.509 --> 03:02:06.111]  Killing you softly, soft killing you lovingly, is a gift of David Rockefeller.
[03:02:06.111 --> 03:02:08.312]  Why would you be against that?
[03:02:08.312 --> 03:02:08.892]  Well, I'm not.
[03:02:08.892 --> 03:02:09.433]  I just don't.
[03:02:09.433 --> 03:02:10.593]  I call the EPA.
[03:02:10.593 --> 03:02:12.434]  I call the FAA.
[03:02:12.434 --> 03:02:14.435]  Every phone call, that's that department.
[03:02:14.435 --> 03:02:18.356]  It was like the Chinese fire drill of phones.
[03:02:18.356 --> 03:02:20.237]  They gave me this department, that department.
[03:02:20.237 --> 03:02:22.038]  I was running around 20 departments.
[03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:23.880]  They don't care.
[03:02:23.880 --> 03:02:24.681]  They don't care.
[03:02:24.681 --> 03:02:26.702]  Well, I mean, that's because we're calling it chemtrails.
[03:02:26.702 --> 03:02:27.702]  We call it FEMA camps.
[03:02:27.702 --> 03:02:28.582]  They're not called FEMA camps.
[03:02:28.582 --> 03:02:32.644]  They're called emergency centers under the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[03:02:32.644 --> 03:02:33.884]  They're not called chemtrails.
[03:02:33.884 --> 03:02:37.085]  They're called aerosol spray geoengineering program.
[03:02:37.085 --> 03:02:39.366]  But yeah, we've got to educate people.
[03:02:39.366 --> 03:02:40.827]  It's why we sell films that cover it.
[03:02:40.827 --> 03:02:43.027]  It's why I've been documenting it for 15 years.
[03:02:43.027 --> 03:02:47.669]  Not every condensation trail is a chemtrail, but there is weather modification going on.
[03:02:47.669 --> 03:02:48.569]  God bless you.
[03:02:48.569 --> 03:02:49.790]  By the way, here's another news article.
[03:02:50.984 --> 03:02:55.228]  Feinstein promotes a bill to strengthen NSA's hand on warrantless wiretapping.
[03:02:55.228 --> 03:02:59.813]  Remember, she came out a few weeks ago and said she was upset about it and she was going to fight it?
[03:02:59.813 --> 03:03:11.044]  That's only to confuse idiot constituents out in California so that she can then sail this over on them.
[03:03:11.044 --> 03:03:13.167]  This woman is a total tyrant, a total pig.
[03:03:15.421 --> 03:03:19.644]  Who is just dedicated to shutting down the free press.
[03:03:19.644 --> 03:03:21.065]  And we need to realize what she is.
[03:03:21.065 --> 03:03:26.509]  I mean, she is a disgusting New World Order piece of garbage.
[03:03:26.509 --> 03:03:29.411]  So, that's basically it.
[03:03:29.411 --> 03:03:31.292]  And she's laughing, folks, because you're naive.
[03:03:31.292 --> 03:03:33.354]  I'm not talking about my regular listeners.
[03:03:33.354 --> 03:03:35.035]  The woman is your sworn enemy.
[03:03:36.145 --> 03:03:42.528]  Let's cram in one more ring-a-dingy until Sunday, if the good Lord allows me to come back, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:03:42.528 --> 03:03:43.328]  Central.
[03:03:43.328 --> 03:03:44.789]  I take nothing for granted.
[03:03:44.789 --> 03:03:49.791]  Ben, in Missouri, last caller, tail gunner, as they call it.
[03:03:49.791 --> 03:03:50.531]  How's it going, Alex?
[03:03:50.531 --> 03:03:53.332]  I'm doing all right.
[03:03:53.332 --> 03:03:53.592]  Great.
[03:03:53.592 --> 03:03:57.334]  Well, I think it was last Friday.
[03:03:57.938 --> 03:04:05.621]  When you started ranting and you told the Trendy Punks that you were going to be piling their bodies and that was great radio, man.
[03:04:05.621 --> 03:04:07.442]  That was great.
[03:04:07.442 --> 03:04:11.063]  No, no, I wasn't saying I was going to pile them.
[03:04:11.063 --> 03:04:16.986]  I'm saying if this civil war kicks off, there'll be piles of dead bodies and we don't want that to happen.
[03:04:16.986 --> 03:04:17.426]  We don't.
[03:04:17.426 --> 03:04:18.927]  Of course we don't.
[03:04:18.927 --> 03:04:20.727]  But anyway, it was great radio.
[03:04:20.727 --> 03:04:22.048]  I really enjoy listening to you.
[03:04:22.048 --> 03:04:25.129]  I listen to you every day at work.
[03:04:25.129 --> 03:04:26.470]  The reason why I call this because
[03:04:27.375 --> 03:04:28.435]  I wanted to share a story.
[03:04:28.435 --> 03:04:34.097]  I was looking at the terms of service for my PlayStation the other day.
[03:04:34.097 --> 03:04:35.518]  And it tells you they can spy on you.
[03:04:35.518 --> 03:04:36.398]  I gotta say one thing.
[03:04:36.398 --> 03:04:36.798]  I'm sorry.
[03:04:36.798 --> 03:04:37.578]  Call me back Sunday.
[03:04:37.578 --> 03:04:38.038]  I'll talk to you.
[03:04:38.038 --> 03:04:38.879]  I apologize.
[03:04:38.879 --> 03:04:40.119]  Everybody should read their terms of service.
[03:04:40.119 --> 03:04:40.619]  Great point.
[03:04:40.619 --> 03:04:41.620]  Look at this.
[03:04:41.620 --> 03:04:46.021]  This is out of LifeSite News, but it's linked to AP.
