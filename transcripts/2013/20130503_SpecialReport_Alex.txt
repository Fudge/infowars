[00:00:03.638 --> 00:00:06.060]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars news bulletin.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.485]  The article on InfoWars.com comes to us from the 10th Amendment Center and reads, Eric Holder threatens Kansas in letter on gun control nullification.
[00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:27.194]  On Thursday, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback received a letter from Attorney General Eric Holder threatening action against the state should it enforce SB102, which Brownback signed into law last month.
[00:00:28.154 --> 00:00:40.434]  The letter reads, In purporting to override federal law and to criminalize the official acts of federal officers, SB-102 directly conflicts with the federal law and is therefore unconstitutional.
[00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:47.221]  Never mind that quote reasonable gun control very much violates the constitutional concept of shall not be infringed.
[00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:55.827]  We saw a similar situation in Texas when the House voted that they no longer desired to be molested at the airport even if the molester wore blue gloves.
[00:00:56.328 --> 00:01:01.792]  And just in case you've forgotten, this is the same Eric Holder who wants to brainwash you about firearms.
[00:01:02.172 --> 00:01:04.634]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:10.317]  And what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people.
[00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:16.241]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:20.904]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:01:20.984 --> 00:01:27.868]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
