[00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:09.098]  So what do you guys think about the NSA spying program?
[00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:11.039]  Uh, no comment.
[00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.502]  I have no comment whatsoever.
[00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:16.023]  So are you cool with it, or?
[00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:17.704]  I'm kind of indifferent about it.
[00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:19.645]  You're indifferent, but it's illegal.
[00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:24.669]  NSA, uh, I have no clue.
[00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:28.396]  I have no idea about anything that's going on.
[00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:34.559]  The National Security Agency is spying on all your telephone calls, your emails, your tweets, your Facebooks.
[00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:36.980]  They have the cameras and the televisions now.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.540]  It's cool.
[00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:41.122]  I'm not a fan of it, but I also have nothing to hide.
[00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:43.824]  I don't really have an opinion for anything about that.
[00:00:44.264 --> 00:00:47.806]  Me personally, I'm not that interesting as a person.
[00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:52.288]  If they do happen to find anything that they want to bring to my attention about me,
[00:00:53.168 --> 00:01:02.530]  But you don't care about the Constitution and the fact that we're in America and there are certain laws and rights that people have fought for hundreds of years to put in place so that this kind of thing wouldn't happen?
[00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.712]  I definitely do care about that, but I also believe in the safety of our country.
[00:01:07.972 --> 00:01:15.074]  Why is it okay if Obama breaks the law and does something illegal or that whole administration, but if you or I break the law, we go to jail?
[00:01:16.554 --> 00:01:19.655]  I am not sure that I understand the thrust of the question there.
[00:01:20.578 --> 00:01:23.660]  The thrust of the question is, it is illegal to spy on Americans.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.722]  In fact, the NSA is spying on your every single tweet and text and phone call.
[00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:32.784]  I feel like if you honestly thought that now is the moment that you're realizing that, you're a little behind the times.
[00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:34.825]  I actually don't know anything about politics.
[00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:37.767]  This isn't politics, this is about America.
[00:01:38.087 --> 00:01:40.428]  I'm not nearly as upset as a lot of people are.
[00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:42.229]  I'd rather be in a safe country.
[00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:44.476]  Does that concern you at all as an American?
[00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:51.163]  I think it concerns me, but at the same time, the stuff that's going through the Texas legislation right now concerns me way further than this stuff.
[00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:56.048]  You can read my tweets and my emails all you want, but please just give me the right to choose what I do with my body.
[00:01:56.408 --> 00:02:03.395]  When it comes to civilian privacy, there should be some sort of say of what the government can and cannot do.
[00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:06.436]  There is, it's called the Constitution.
[00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:07.276]  Okay.
[00:02:07.636 --> 00:02:11.598]  The job of the Congress and the President is a tough job.
[00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:15.199]  But I know they have a conscience in what they do.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.780]  I know.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.942]  But they're droning and killing innocent children and people in other countries.
[00:02:21.222 --> 00:02:25.303]  I think that if I'm doing something that offends you, you have every right to
[00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:28.336]  Arrest you.
[00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:30.699]  Call the police on me, not arrest me.
[00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:36.986]  If someone in authority wants to do something bad to you that's within his authority, he can.
[00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:40.351]  And that's not gonna be stopped anytime soon, and it's not a recent development.
[00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:42.195]  So you're just gonna lay down and take it?
[00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.937]  Like, you're cool with the fact that America is f***ed?
[00:02:45.977 --> 00:02:47.238]  Like, we're going down the tube?
[00:02:47.358 --> 00:02:48.859]  That's what they did in Nazi Germany.
[00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:57.144]  When they would tell, and like, all the gay people, and all the black people, and all the Jews got put in camps because their neighbors were telling on them?
[00:02:57.605 --> 00:02:58.465]  To furthest Aussie?
[00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:00.666]  I mean, is that... that's... cool?
[00:03:01.727 --> 00:03:09.076]  No, but are you referring to government spying in today's society to Nazi Germany?
[00:03:09.517 --> 00:03:10.158]  Yes, I am.
[00:03:10.678 --> 00:03:11.059]  Okay.
[00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:19.008]  Why did you find it funny when I thought that everyone telling on their neighbors here with the whole see something, say something, and I referred it to Nazi Germany?
[00:03:19.028 --> 00:03:20.050]  Why was that funny to you?
[00:03:20.772 --> 00:03:27.594]  In any sort of debate, eventually if it goes on long enough, someone will bring up Hitler or the Nazis.
[00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:32.535]  It's gotten to a silly point where it probably doesn't make any sense.
[00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:38.277]  But see, don't you think that that's something that stops people from having an intelligent discussion about where this is headed?
[00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:40.477]  No, I absolutely don't.
[00:03:40.497 --> 00:03:43.718]  And that's why we have a constitution and you're innocent until proven guilty.
[00:03:43.738 --> 00:03:44.538]  It's America.
[00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:46.159]  That's why we have these rules in place.
[00:03:46.954 --> 00:03:48.656]  That's how they're proving you guilty, right?
[00:03:48.977 --> 00:03:54.343]  By... budding into your business and listening to what you have to say and stuff?
[00:03:54.623 --> 00:03:56.025]  That's been happening forever.
[00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:57.327]  It's not an American problem.
[00:03:57.387 --> 00:03:58.788]  It's a problem with humanity.
[00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:00.891]  Kind of like Nazi Germany?
[00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:07.625]  And actually, you do a lot of gardening, so do you realize, looking at fertilizer and things, you're probably already on a list.
[00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:08.306]  Totally, yeah.
[00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:15.510]  And seeds, and we have aquaponic systems, and we're on every list you could possibly be on, so I figure, what's the worst that could happen, you know?
[00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.612]  Oh, so you're like a survivalist.
[00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:18.432]  Wow.
[00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:19.713]  Terrorists, right here.
[00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:20.513]  See, Obama?
[00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:24.116]  We really could get struck down by terrorists at any time.
[00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:27.058]  Obama thinks that all of us are idiots.
[00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:32.281]  Obama just went on Jay Leno last night and said, there's no domestic spying program.
[00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:34.562]  I mean, he thinks you're an idiot.
[00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:37.024]  I haven't heard anything about that in particular.
[00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:38.725]  He thinks Americans are idiots.
