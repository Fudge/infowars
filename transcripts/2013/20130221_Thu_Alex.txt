[00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:10.100]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.580]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:13.221]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:17.502]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:22.183]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:25.684]  Okay, I'm going to be honest with listeners.
[00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:31.565]  I'm just going to lay it all out here on the table on this 21st day of February 2013 Thursday edition.
[00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:49.048]  This radio broadcast is growing by leaps and bounds, and we definitely more and more have the attention of the American people, to a great extent, and the people of the world.
[00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.092]  At least we have the attention of people that are trying to find out what's happening.
[00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:56.775]  And that is just an incredible responsibility.
[00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:05.963]  And I have a wonderful team of reporters, researchers, crew, you the listeners, the supporters, our friends in the media worldwide who love Liberty as well.
[00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:21.225]  But occasionally I'll listen to a rebroadcast of a show or part of it, and sometimes I'm really spot on, other times, other times it is a bunch of gibbering.
[00:01:23.427 --> 00:01:29.092]  Because it is real, and it's teleprompter free, and there's no producer telling me what to do, I'm in charge.
[00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.537]  But as I've said to The Globalist many times, they're in charge of the world, they're not in charge of themselves.
[00:01:35.238 --> 00:01:36.099]  And it's the same thing.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.588]  I'm in charge, but I'm not really in charge of myself when it comes to this radio broadcast.
[00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.854]  And I think back to shows I did ten years ago, even.
[00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:53.844]  And I've gone back and listened to some of those where I was even more focused and would go through more news and get to more calls.
[00:01:54.685 --> 00:02:02.369]  And in ways, the broadcast has gotten more informative and I've gotten more informed when it comes to how the world works, as we all do.
[00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.911]  A wise man knows how little he knows.
[00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:06.492]  The fool thinks he knows everything.
[00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:13.624]  But I don't want to say this broadcast is in a rut because we've added a lot of new things to it.
[00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:14.285]  It's gotten better.
[00:02:14.305 --> 00:02:17.450]  We've got the reporters, more and more special news pieces.
[00:02:18.332 --> 00:02:21.536]  It's just that at the level this broadcast has already made it.
[00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.412]  I am going to attempt to really shake the show up.
[00:02:26.153 --> 00:02:28.535]  And a lot of that means do I screen the phone calls as well?
[00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:32.198]  Because, you know, sometimes opening the phones up on a specific topic, best calls in the world.
[00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.904]  But if I just open it up to general stuff, it's guys calling in who are on their day off who are already into a half bottle of whiskey.
[00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.045]  Which is fine.
[00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:43.589]  It's just that I'm not sitting around, you know, with the local VFW shooting the breeze.
[00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.352]  You know, having a few suds.
[00:02:48.018 --> 00:02:48.919]  So there's that issue.
[00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:57.704]  There's the issue of the frustration of every day I come in here and I've scanned over before I got here and then when I get here, sometimes 200 articles, usually about 100.
[00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:04.749]  I've got all these video clips, all these reports, all this incredible information, all these insights to try to transmit to you.
[00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.995]  But I get so excited and go into a rant mode and the first hour is generally the best hour for my content.
[00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:17.378]  And then we usually have guests on because I know that I tend to degenerate by the second and third hour.
[00:03:18.614 --> 00:03:22.755]  And it's on the days where I don't have guests, where I decide to not have guests, that that becomes evident.
[00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:26.956]  And I'm probably over-analyzing this, it's just that these are extraordinary times we're in.
[00:03:27.596 --> 00:03:28.836]  Very extraordinary times.
[00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:40.518]  And so I must, absolutely must, get myself to the point of where I'm in control.
[00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:42.838]  Because I'll say I'm going to go to your calls, I don't go to them.
[00:03:43.238 --> 00:03:44.879]  Or when I do, I'll let a caller go too long.
[00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:52.523]  I say I'm going to cover something in the next hour, I start covering it right then, and then never fully cover it.
[00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:55.946]  And it's just, I'm going to tell you, you've got this commitment from Alex Jones.
[00:03:56.687 --> 00:04:07.596]  Because we're getting on more and more stations, because more and more InfoWars.com's a household name, because of the responsibility we've got, because nobody's telling me up my game, I'm saying it.
[00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:08.977]  I'm saying it.
[00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:11.139]  A lot of times I'm a travesty.
[00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:23.182]  People come up and thank me and say how great I am and it's like punching me in the stomach because I just want to beat the tyrants and I know how horrible I am and these people are counting on me.
[00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:24.403]  I don't know how to explain it.
[00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:31.708]  One of my good friends had a heart attack a few weeks ago and he was telling me that he got mad.
[00:04:31.748 --> 00:04:33.089]  He felt like he let his family down.
[00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:35.981]  Sixty-something years old, having a heart attack.
[00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:39.082]  And somebody that doesn't know what it is to be a man, they don't understand that.
[00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:41.863]  A man with children, a man with responsibilities.
[00:04:42.423 --> 00:04:47.284]  It's like, people are saying, oh, you're so great, and it makes you go, oh, man, I gotta do even better.
[00:04:47.304 --> 00:04:48.564]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:04:48.624 --> 00:04:55.445]  It's like, that's why it's painful when you tell me how great I am, because I know the potential is like 500 times better.
[00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:57.946]  We'll be right back with incredibly important news.
[00:04:58.306 --> 00:04:58.806]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.604 --> 00:05:04.647]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:10.473]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:14.257]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:05:14.938 --> 00:05:16.199]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:20.403]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.871]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.732]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[00:06:04.912 --> 00:06:06.993]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[00:06:07.253 --> 00:06:08.814]  What can you not live without?
[00:06:08.974 --> 00:06:10.415]  What is your greatest dependency?
[00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:11.395]  Is it your guns?
[00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:12.296]  Is it your home?
[00:06:12.616 --> 00:06:13.736]  No, it's food.
[00:06:14.037 --> 00:06:15.917]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:19.439]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:20.720]  Don't be dependent.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.841]  Be self-sufficient.
[00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.561]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[00:06:23.642 --> 00:06:24.302]  Feed yourself.
[00:06:24.742 --> 00:06:26.844]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:06:26.984 --> 00:06:30.306]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:33.148]  It's the best long-term storable food on the planet.

[00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.072]  A 24-day supply of food plus stove, cook pot, and fuel.

[00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:52.482]  Build your food supply, be in control, be self-sufficient, and be a patriot.
[00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:57.688]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:14.084]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[00:07:14.944 --> 00:07:25.011]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:29.193]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[00:07:30.034 --> 00:07:36.218]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:47.387]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.
[00:07:48.207 --> 00:07:55.934]  Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver based products are best for you.
[00:07:56.975 --> 00:07:59.897]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:17.253]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commons.
[00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:23.795]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:08:23.815 --> 00:08:29.036]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:08:29.896 --> 00:08:31.356]  It is a big idea.
[00:08:32.417 --> 00:08:33.377]  A new world order.
[00:08:37.094 --> 00:08:39.899]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:41.361]  It just pancaked.
[00:08:41.462 --> 00:08:47.772]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:09:01.044 --> 00:09:06.618]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.011]  Guns will be taken.
[00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.272]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:09:13.572 --> 00:09:14.753]  We're going to take all the guns.
[00:09:14.793 --> 00:09:19.597]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:09:19.637 --> 00:09:21.098]  Global governance at last.
[00:09:21.178 --> 00:09:22.138]  Is it one world?
[00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:23.820]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.322]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:31.325]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:09:33.747 --> 00:09:38.431]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:42.607 --> 00:09:45.867]  I don't know how anyone out there could say that they're bored.
[00:09:47.429 --> 00:10:13.468]  A great animating contest between the forces of total despotism and a scientific worldwide technocratic tyranny are attempting to eradicate what we know of as the normal operating system of the human species and evolve us, I put that in quotes, devolve us, into their technotronic man-machine interface age of which only a select few will enter in the future.
[00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:26.653]  And I have some articles on the technological front that integrate in and illustrate or illustrative of what I want to cover on that subject, and I'll do that later in the second hour today.
[00:10:26.673 --> 00:10:27.974]  I will get to it.
[00:10:29.134 --> 00:10:31.855]  We're also going to look at the destabilized Middle East program.
[00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:34.236]  Why are the globalists putting radicals in charge everywhere?
[00:10:34.276 --> 00:10:37.817]  How does it tie into the larger geopolitical systems?
[00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:55.627]  We're also going to look at John Kerry, the Secretary of State, the globalist, the Skull and Bones member, running around pushing climate change and carbon taxes is the most important thing America faces, his first speech as Secretary of State.
[00:10:56.978 --> 00:11:06.770]  The national and local media in Wisconsin has gone into conniption fit overdrive over the Sheriff Clark in Milwaukee County and what he said on this show.
[00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:16.981]  And before I even saw this article this morning, I intended to come on air and call yet again, but here we are a few months later with an update.
[00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:23.774]  For a second American revolution, but a peaceful revolution ahead of them starting a violent one.
[00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:25.217]  And the sheriff agreed.
[00:11:25.257 --> 00:11:26.981]  He said it'll be up to the American people.
[00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:32.910]  When this is going to start, the American people will decide when to push back, not me.
[00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:42.114]  And they're scared of Clark, because I've read his resume, the guy's like a super cop, before he became sheriff of that county.
[00:11:42.514 --> 00:11:50.757]  And they're afraid of the now 400, it's now over 400, it was 350 just four or five days ago, sheriffs saying they're going to fight the New World Order.
[00:11:51.357 --> 00:11:53.418]  And look, the intel's out, okay?
[00:11:53.438 --> 00:11:57.139]  It's not like it's our opinion we're going into a tyranny, as Sheriff Clark has said.
[00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:08.283]  I mean, they're really afraid of focused, handsome, smart, with great record police officers, sheriffs, but anybody else that can be a leader.
[00:12:08.884 --> 00:12:10.846]  And they really hate this guy because he's black.
[00:12:12.307 --> 00:12:15.009]  And I saw something special in him in the TV interviews I saw.
[00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:15.970]  That's why we got him on.
[00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:18.152]  They're really scared of people like this.
[00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:18.653]  You know why?
[00:12:18.673 --> 00:12:23.217]  Because conservatives and libertarians would follow somebody like Clark in a minute.
[00:12:23.937 --> 00:12:24.798]  In a minute.
[00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:26.599]  And they want division.
[00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:27.639]  They don't want unity.
[00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:38.686]  They don't want us having unity under liberty, under private property, under due process, under the family, under law and order enshrined in the Second Amendment, what made this country so powerful.
[00:12:38.846 --> 00:12:40.807]  Because this country's got a lot of evil in its history.
[00:12:41.347 --> 00:12:45.290]  But compared to other nations, which they never teach you about, we have been the best.
[00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:53.447]  The best in science, the best in sports, the best in research, the best in development, the best in courage, the best in war.
[00:12:54.328 --> 00:12:59.136]  Because we had the best shot at freedom, a head start on everybody else.
[00:13:00.455 --> 00:13:06.681]  That's why they don't teach you the founders tried to get rid of slavery, but the British government threatened to reinvade if they did.
[00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:10.484]  They don't tell you slavery was going on every other place in the world at that time.
[00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:19.031]  They only tell you America, because they want to demonize the Republic and the idea in it, because it's anathema to monopolies.
[00:13:19.552 --> 00:13:21.293]  It's anathema to cartels.
[00:13:24.156 --> 00:13:27.119]  It's anathema to royalty and insiders.
[00:13:29.056 --> 00:13:30.377]  What is royalty?
[00:13:30.417 --> 00:13:31.758]  It is generational mafia.
[00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:33.520]  It is generational strongmen.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.380]  It is North Korea.
[00:13:35.661 --> 00:13:38.063]  I predict that another generation will be wearing gold crowns.
[00:13:38.103 --> 00:13:47.811]  In fact, they already have him wearing royal hats and saying that the sun comes out because of Kim Jong-il's grandfather, Kim Jong-il's father, and Kim Jong-un, and all the rest of it.
[00:13:48.211 --> 00:13:55.417]  That's what we're fighting, is the stagnation of elites that don't want to compete and who want to dominate everybody.
[00:13:55.797 --> 00:13:56.438]  Now, here's the deal.
[00:13:59.318 --> 00:14:14.674]  I meant to do this the last few months and so many times I don't get into the really weighty issues because I think at a subconscious level I feel like, as I know many of you feel, that I'm not worthy to be trying to launch something this big.
[00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:15.996]  Well, none of us are worthy.
[00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:17.277]  All of us have fallen short.
[00:14:17.918 --> 00:14:19.379]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:20.621]  The fact is we have a duty.
[00:14:21.758 --> 00:14:25.640]  And so, I have procrastinated and written up notes many times.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:31.143]  I don't know, three months ago I called for a second American Revolution, a peaceful restoration, a plan.
[00:14:31.163 --> 00:14:33.305]  I had many constitutional top lawyers on.
[00:14:33.325 --> 00:14:50.855]  They concurred with my analysis and said it's actually found in the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, Federalist Papers, Anti-Federalist Papers, and gave different pathways for the basic plan I developed that was just based on a re-upload of the Bill of Rights and Constitution via the Declaration of Independence.
[00:14:53.157 --> 00:14:54.538]  So it's not really my plan.
[00:14:54.678 --> 00:15:13.608]  I simply stated that a revolution, a restoration of the Republic, when you hear about it is our right, our duty to throw off oppressive governments and to make new ones for the protection of the people's rights and liberties, to paraphrase the Declaration of Independence,
[00:15:14.668 --> 00:15:20.671]  That is the total plan there stating the inherent right is in all of us.
[00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:22.292]  We the people are the boss.
[00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:23.653]  We are the sovereigns.
[00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:30.837]  And so the media has always sold a Declaration of Independence as a bad thing because it's saying the government can be abolished.
[00:15:31.237 --> 00:15:34.139]  And then they sold that like it will abolish the Republic.
[00:15:34.499 --> 00:15:35.900]  It will abolish America.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.342]  It will abolish DC, the federal government.
[00:15:40.578 --> 00:15:41.238]  D.C.
[00:15:41.338 --> 00:16:01.565]  and the federal government has been overrun and captured and the republic has been abolished and even the American empire is to be phased out and abolished and transferred into NATO and the communist Chinese as the two main seats of power with the United States as a Hessian mercenary military supply system.
[00:16:03.466 --> 00:16:07.567]  And even that's only a 10-year program because after that it goes total robot.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.302]  I mean, this is the real world we're talking about.
[00:16:12.163 --> 00:16:13.945]  This is humans being phased out.
[00:16:14.866 --> 00:16:16.127]  This is humans not needed.
[00:16:16.147 --> 00:16:20.050]  And you can point at the slob-like public, point at ourselves, I'll point at myself.
[00:16:21.191 --> 00:16:24.975]  A shadow compared to my forebearers, undoubtedly.
[00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:28.258]  Because adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:41.578]  But as bent as I am, I'm not half as bent as the general public, and I don't take pleasure out of their societal deformities.
[00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:49.524]  I feel great pain in it, because my children and my progeny and my bloodlines flow out into the future.
[00:16:50.705 --> 00:16:59.411]  And I stand between the past and the future, learning from both, wishing to go forward with good cheer and good heart and good will.
[00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:00.870]  Goodwill.
[00:17:01.291 --> 00:17:02.031]  I have goodwill.
[00:17:04.033 --> 00:17:05.053]  I want to build up.
[00:17:05.154 --> 00:17:06.194]  I don't want to be cynical.
[00:17:06.475 --> 00:17:09.457]  I don't want to cheat people and get ahead and laugh at them.
[00:17:09.477 --> 00:17:11.178]  I want to build them up.
[00:17:11.258 --> 00:17:22.967]  But the dangerous horde screaming for blood is being taught by the technocrats that they will tear apart those of us that produce and feed on us in a predatory
[00:17:24.272 --> 00:17:38.080]  implosion syndrome that I liken to a cannibalistic, neo-feudalistic, controlled road warrior collapse, which they call agenda 21 in the post-industrial system.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:52.328]  I mean, this is an epic time to be alive, an epic plan we face, epic eugenicist-based technocrat globalists who, you gotta hand it to them, have had a long-term nightmare plan and have really carried a lot of it out.
[00:17:52.348 --> 00:17:53.429]  They're about 10 years behind.
[00:17:54.605 --> 00:17:55.606]  I mean, it's epic.
[00:17:56.407 --> 00:17:59.690]  And a lot of technocrats will say, well, Alex, they're in control.
[00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:00.571]  We're in control.
[00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:03.634]  Speaking of themselves, we're going to win.
[00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:06.076]  And you should just try to join us.
[00:18:06.217 --> 00:18:11.622]  Isn't the fact that we're in control the evidence that we should be in charge?
[00:18:12.563 --> 00:18:15.366]  And I sat there and watched a lot of my family die of cancer.
[00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:18.339]  And I've watched friends die of cancer.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.860]  I've watched people take their last breaths.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.482]  Even though it was painful, it was important moments to experience that death, not to hide away from it, to see it.
[00:18:25.762 --> 00:18:27.143]  To know how transient we are.
[00:18:27.263 --> 00:18:29.024]  Out, out, brief candle to quote Shakespeare.
[00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:34.346]  And I have sat there and watched people battle cancer.
[00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:36.106]  And I've said this before, I'll say it again.
[00:18:36.506 --> 00:18:40.108]  If cancer had a consciousness, it would think it was winning.
[00:18:41.127 --> 00:18:49.713]  No, you are not winning and you do not have a right to be doing what you're doing because your eugenics would be bad enough if you were killing the infirm and the stupid.
[00:18:52.335 --> 00:18:57.959]  But you are targeting the beautiful and the intelligent and the enlightened because you're threatened by it.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.822]  And that is just beyond, beyond evil.
[00:19:02.998 --> 00:19:04.059]  You people are cancer.
[00:19:04.499 --> 00:19:05.940]  Now, I want to just take calls.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.382]  I'm not going to go to news the next 40 minutes.
[00:19:07.402 --> 00:19:11.345]  I'm going to take your calls, first-time callers, on how do you think we fix America and the world?
[00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:13.326]  What do you think the big false flag is going to be?
[00:19:13.547 --> 00:19:25.817]  What do you think of millions, $2 million worth of targets, some of them are as low as $5 a piece, I don't know how many targets that is, of children to be shot, old women, old men, all of them the new white al-Qaeda, the new shift to that.
[00:19:25.877 --> 00:19:26.958]  What do you think about that report?
[00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.743]  First time callers, have your point ready.
[00:19:29.823 --> 00:19:30.984]  I will take a bunch of your calls.
[00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:32.806]  I'm in disciplined focus mode.
[00:19:32.826 --> 00:19:32.866]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:32.886 --> 00:19:33.247]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:33.267 --> 00:19:35.729]  And then I'll take your calls and I'll start my engines on the news.
[00:19:43.217 --> 00:19:52.862]  And a new refocus on the Second American Revolution and how it ties into headlines, and how to wrest control of humanity from the jaws of the psychopathic technocrat guild.
[00:19:53.342 --> 00:19:54.503]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:19:54.563 --> 00:19:57.925]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.

[00:20:50.277 --> 00:20:52.419]  Time and time again.

[00:20:59.863 --> 00:21:05.447]  We need assistance.

[00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:12.272]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:21:12.572 --> 00:21:18.656]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.

[00:24:31.834 --> 00:24:34.696]  By the way, Immortal Techniques in town right now.
[00:24:34.716 --> 00:24:36.398]  I think he's going to come over and do the nightly news.
[00:24:36.418 --> 00:24:39.060]  That should be an interesting interview tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[00:24:40.661 --> 00:24:43.264]  Basically, we've announced a giant online film festival.
[00:24:43.284 --> 00:24:46.827]  That's Operation Paul Revere, a new video out on that subject.
[00:24:46.847 --> 00:24:48.448]  We're going to be playing a clip of that.
[00:24:49.449 --> 00:24:53.432]  Stocks plunge as Fed members admit endless bond buying will not fix the economy.
[00:24:54.349 --> 00:24:54.769]  Hello there, Alex.
[00:25:16.753 --> 00:25:21.454]  I've heard you kind of criticizing yourself.
[00:25:21.634 --> 00:25:31.737]  I often listen to the show and I hear the neocons from time to time as well, and your worst show usually dwarfs their best show.
[00:25:32.277 --> 00:25:33.017]  Oh, I know that.
[00:25:33.137 --> 00:25:41.099]  I'm just simply saying I want to refocus on real solutions, and that's exposing the crimes of the globalists and then talking about ways to defeat them.
[00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:43.060]  So I don't really want to get off into
[00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.831]  I mean, I've already made my statements on how I'm going to try to focus the show.
[00:25:47.851 --> 00:25:48.571]  Go ahead and make your point.
[00:25:48.611 --> 00:25:48.891]  Thank you.
[00:25:49.291 --> 00:25:49.831]  Yes.
[00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:53.792]  Also, I wanted to mention the modified atmosphere.
[00:25:53.912 --> 00:26:00.794]  Several months ago, I obtained, and I want to encourage others to do it, if they've already done it, great.
[00:26:00.894 --> 00:26:03.635]  And others should need to do this as well.
[00:26:03.735 --> 00:26:06.035]  Get a hold of a microscope.
[00:26:06.235 --> 00:26:07.536]  Get some rain samples.
[00:26:07.596 --> 00:26:09.956]  Look at your rain under a microscope.
[00:26:10.056 --> 00:26:11.637]  Look at what is falling on you.
[00:26:13.579 --> 00:26:15.600]  It's mind-boggling.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:26.245]  I have water samples still that I have kept for several months in my refrigerator, and it's amazing what happens over the long term.
[00:26:26.325 --> 00:26:37.871]  The little glass containers I have the water in, when I first collected it, with the cap on it, if you shook it off, it looked like Santa Claus should be standing in there.
[00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:41.353]  And now, over the course of several months,
[00:26:42.073 --> 00:26:48.396]  All of those disgusting fibers, and God knows what that's in there, has all clumped together.
[00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:55.439]  Well, you should shoot a YouTube video of that and show it, but that's really unscientific, and I'm not pooh-poohing the fact that you're doing that.
[00:26:55.459 --> 00:26:59.180]  That's a good way to start out, observing things, and I appreciate your call.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.681]  Here's my issue with weather modification.
[00:27:02.541 --> 00:27:03.502]  Let's not exaggerate.
[00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:06.864]  There are 20,000 different papers.
[00:27:06.924 --> 00:27:07.964]  That's a conservative number.
[00:27:08.004 --> 00:27:09.125]  You can go look at it on Google.
[00:27:09.945 --> 00:27:14.327]  Universities, Department of Energy, other governments, UN treaties on weather modification.
[00:27:14.627 --> 00:27:15.807]  They call it all testing.
[00:27:16.307 --> 00:27:17.588]  And it's going on everywhere.
[00:27:17.608 --> 00:27:25.291]  Al Gore talked about it on Ellen last week, admitted it was going on, and said he thought it was a crazy idea, which is ridiculous.
[00:27:25.691 --> 00:27:27.171]  And then said, isn't the weather scary?
[00:27:27.231 --> 00:27:28.792]  And there's undoubtedly, I've interviewed
[00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:30.731]  Let's not exaggerate.
[00:27:30.771 --> 00:27:39.797]  Five, six meteorologists, some of them that actually work at TV stations, saying, clearly you can see the jets come in, the military aircraft, block fronts, make fronts worse.
[00:27:39.817 --> 00:27:47.802]  It was in the San Antonio Express News, like 15 years ago, there was a big flood, and it killed 34 people, I think, in one night in South Texas.
[00:27:48.182 --> 00:27:51.044]  And they said, the Navy says they're weather mod spraying.
[00:27:51.124 --> 00:27:52.364]  Was it involved in this?
[00:27:52.705 --> 00:27:53.805]  Just a footnote in there.
[00:27:54.686 --> 00:27:56.207]  So my frustration is,
[00:27:57.967 --> 00:28:13.392]  I've done special reports, I've had guests on, I've promoted two films we sell, What in the World Are They Spraying, and Why Are They Spraying, that are available on InfoWarsTore.com, where it goes through, and I've sent my crew two weather mod conferences.
[00:28:14.552 --> 00:28:19.854]  And it's not just little companies doing it, making the ski slopes have snow, it's not just things like that.
[00:28:20.354 --> 00:28:22.994]  It's big, giant government and corporate operations.
[00:28:23.014 --> 00:28:24.475]  Bill Gates spends billions a year.
[00:28:27.945 --> 00:28:30.667]  Manipulating hurricanes, manipulating snow storms.
[00:28:31.327 --> 00:28:35.250]  And then we say, hey, the Russians say they control the weather, the Chinese are doing it.
[00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:36.671]  They're doing it in Dubai.
[00:28:38.172 --> 00:28:41.334]  Hey, our government pioneered this and I've interviewed the father of weather weapons.
[00:28:41.354 --> 00:28:43.855]  I think he's still alive, he's like 95 years old, Ben Livingston.
[00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:46.457]  He first flew into hurricanes and typhoons and things.
[00:28:46.697 --> 00:28:50.920]  He could take a cloudless sky and flood the Ho Chi Minh Trail with 10 feet of water.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.422]  That interview is up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:28:53.822 --> 00:28:55.323]  The father of weather weapons, Ben Livingston.
[00:28:56.648 --> 00:29:05.990]  And no one ever wants to talk about that, or the aerosol spraying program, or the Department of Energy programs, or all the admissions.
[00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:15.533]  It's like, it's all admitted that the government has declassified thousands of lethal chemical, biological, radiological releases on the public.
[00:29:16.733 --> 00:29:20.034]  And then every time I get called or something on the streets, they're like, did you see the chemtrails?
[00:29:20.294 --> 00:29:21.374]  Will you talk more about them?
[00:29:22.065 --> 00:29:24.187]  Hey, you know, I think they're doing this.
[00:29:24.247 --> 00:29:25.108]  What do you think they're doing?
[00:29:25.368 --> 00:29:26.689]  I know exactly what they're doing.
[00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:37.238]  I have the patents, where they add the barium salts, aluminum dioxide to the three major jet fuel manufacturers, part of a national security compartmentalization.
[00:29:37.598 --> 00:29:39.460]  It's been sprayed out even from those jets.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.521]  They have specialized jets.
[00:29:40.801 --> 00:29:42.022]  It's all a public program.
[00:29:42.422 --> 00:29:44.464]  It's like, can we prove there's a new world order?
[00:29:44.744 --> 00:29:46.646]  It's all hiding in plain view.
[00:29:47.127 --> 00:29:48.328]  I mean, it's going on.
[00:29:48.348 --> 00:29:49.709]  More calls coming up.
[00:29:50.506 --> 00:29:53.491]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.511 --> 00:29:57.116]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.357 --> 00:31:08.219]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.821]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.

[00:32:04.552 --> 00:32:06.633]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[00:32:06.893 --> 00:32:08.454]  What can you not live without?
[00:32:08.615 --> 00:32:10.056]  What is your greatest dependency?
[00:32:10.336 --> 00:32:11.036]  Is it your guns?
[00:32:11.316 --> 00:32:11.937]  Is it your home?
[00:32:12.257 --> 00:32:13.378]  No, it's food.
[00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:15.560]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.082]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[00:32:19.302 --> 00:32:20.363]  Don't be dependent.
[00:32:20.543 --> 00:32:21.484]  Be self-sufficient.
[00:32:21.624 --> 00:32:23.205]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[00:32:23.285 --> 00:32:23.946]  Feed yourself.
[00:32:24.386 --> 00:32:26.488]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:32:26.608 --> 00:32:29.951]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.

[00:33:08.377 --> 00:33:14.603]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.936 --> 00:33:22.537]  Yeah, that's what the police said they were going to do.
[00:33:22.557 --> 00:33:23.778]  We're going to burn that house down.
[00:33:23.818 --> 00:33:25.079]  Burn that effing house down.
[00:33:25.139 --> 00:33:25.840]  Burn him up.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.101]  Bring in the fire.
[00:33:27.161 --> 00:33:27.781]  Burn him up.
[00:33:27.901 --> 00:33:29.022]  Okay, the burners are placed.
[00:33:29.582 --> 00:33:30.323]  They're on fire.
[00:33:30.363 --> 00:33:31.083]  We have fire.
[00:33:31.143 --> 00:33:31.884]  Mission completed.
[00:33:31.924 --> 00:33:32.925]  The house is burned down.
[00:33:32.945 --> 00:33:34.746]  They're like, we didn't burn him down.
[00:33:34.786 --> 00:33:36.287]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:43.112]  And CNN, as I predicted, said Alex Jones and his conspiracy theory that the police burned that down.
[00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:46.555]  Alex Jones is helping Dorner.
[00:33:46.595 --> 00:33:47.956]  Remember that clip from a few days ago?
[00:33:49.218 --> 00:34:04.749]  This shows that reality and common sense is what the system is at war with because common sense says we have a big fat criminal government and an establishment that's grown up around it that is feeding on us and it needs to stop.
[00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:07.871]  Now finishing up on the weather modification point the last caller brought up.
[00:34:08.737 --> 00:34:09.657]  Which is a very good point.
[00:34:10.558 --> 00:34:16.060]  But yes, there is all sorts of normal bacteria, spider webs, debris in the atmosphere.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:21.823]  There's also the jet stream that goes over India and China that dumps over the Midwest, filled with toxic waste.
[00:34:22.483 --> 00:34:28.806]  They're always going, we found more toxic waste in the air, more taxes locally, more catalytic converters on your tractor.
[00:34:29.126 --> 00:34:36.970]  Nothing's coming out of the tractor but water vapor and carbon dioxide and some carbon monoxide, but they'll still tax you because China has
[00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:39.030]  Everything burning dirty.
[00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.071]  The river's catching on fire.
[00:34:41.391 --> 00:34:44.331]  Dirtier environment than anywhere on Earth's ever had.
[00:34:44.671 --> 00:34:45.772]  But there's no discussion of that.
[00:34:45.832 --> 00:34:52.493]  It's all, we're going to shut your power plants down that are clean and let China have whatever they want because there's pollutants in the air.
[00:34:52.913 --> 00:34:54.533]  But never a discussion of where they came from.
[00:34:55.814 --> 00:34:59.654]  But on the issue of the weather modification, it's one of the biggest issues.
[00:35:00.235 --> 00:35:01.755]  And we've done special reports on it.
[00:35:01.775 --> 00:35:03.235]  We'll do more special reports on it.
[00:35:03.275 --> 00:35:05.836]  But look up UN treaties on weather modification, 1978.
[00:35:08.455 --> 00:35:09.676]  Look up the other treaties.
[00:35:09.756 --> 00:35:13.000]  It's all going on and they're using bad weather.
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:18.606]  There is some unusual weather going on to devastate certain areas of the world.
[00:35:18.726 --> 00:35:19.587]  Weather as a weapon.
[00:35:20.007 --> 00:35:24.352]  The Secretary of Defense William Cohen talked about in the April issue of Army Times.
[00:35:25.393 --> 00:35:30.496]  April 18th issue of Army Times, where he gave a press conference and talked about weather weapons.
[00:35:31.076 --> 00:35:37.020]  So yes, weather weapons are real, and undoubtedly there's weather mod going on, on a giant scale.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.661]  Yeah, there's the UN Weapons Treaty.
[00:35:39.281 --> 00:35:40.982]  Let's scroll down and see if my memory was right, about 78.
[00:35:41.282 --> 00:35:45.384]  Well, that's one on 1972.
[00:35:45.424 --> 00:35:47.646]  They must have updated it in 77 and then in 78.
[00:35:47.766 --> 00:35:47.966]  Yep.
[00:35:49.066 --> 00:35:50.647]  So I guess the latest version was 1978, started in 72.
[00:35:50.687 --> 00:35:51.208]  I mean, the point is,
[00:35:54.187 --> 00:35:57.549]  See, they know the public's so ignorant, they're like, I heard there's a U.N.
[00:35:58.149 --> 00:36:00.310]  Never saw it, but heard it's there.
[00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.830]  I heard there's FEMA camps.
[00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:04.051]  I heard the military's trying to take our guns.
[00:36:04.392 --> 00:36:05.592]  Well, go watch my films.
[00:36:05.612 --> 00:36:07.553]  I mean, you'll see them trying to take your guns.
[00:36:08.033 --> 00:36:09.534]  You can read it in the newspaper if you want.
[00:36:11.326 --> 00:36:13.308]  I heard there's a plan to forcibly inoculate us.
[00:36:13.568 --> 00:36:16.450]  It's the Model State Self-Emergency Powers Act.
[00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.631]  Yes, I just gave you the name of it.
[00:36:18.352 --> 00:36:20.593]  I heard there's a plan to have the Army have forced labor.
[00:36:21.094 --> 00:36:22.615]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:36:22.815 --> 00:36:28.079]  I mean, you type that into army.mil, you're going to get all the maps, the documents, the names, everything.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.022]  See, it's all going on.
[00:36:31.102 --> 00:36:34.244]  Reality's going on, and then you've got what the TV heads are getting.
[00:36:35.485 --> 00:36:37.046]  I was talking to Weldon Henson last night.
[00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:40.009]  We went shooting yesterday evening with some of my other friends at Steiner's.
[00:36:41.463 --> 00:36:49.628]  And he was talking about, you know, I don't watch a lot of TV, I'm gonna go to your calls here in a moment, but I like Hawaii Five-O, the new one, but he goes, I gotta quit watching it.
[00:36:50.689 --> 00:36:59.754]  I'll get home tired on Monday nights, and he also plays country music four nights a week live, pretty popular band, and, well, the Henson Band.
[00:37:01.949 --> 00:37:07.854]  And he said, I'll get home with my wife and, you know, I'll try to watch that and just, you know, forget about stuff.
[00:37:08.714 --> 00:37:09.855]  But it's the new generation.
[00:37:09.915 --> 00:37:12.077]  It's got Dano's son and McGarrett's son.
[00:37:12.117 --> 00:37:15.820]  And he said basically every episode lined up with Dorner exactly.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:21.084]  While that was happening, that episode aired where a Vietnam vet, uh,
[00:37:23.283 --> 00:37:31.471]  is shooting police officers sniper style and the veterans and gun owners are bad and Dan Owen McGarrett are like, we've got to get rid of the Second Amendment.
[00:37:31.831 --> 00:37:33.193]  I'm sure a lot of you saw the episode.
[00:37:33.453 --> 00:37:34.334]  It's a popular show.
[00:37:34.914 --> 00:37:36.356]  We've got to get rid of the Second Amendment.
[00:37:38.263 --> 00:37:39.904]  And there is no right to own guns.
[00:37:39.964 --> 00:37:40.924]  Guns are the problem.
[00:37:41.064 --> 00:37:43.005]  And McGarrett and Dano win the argument.
[00:37:43.065 --> 00:37:44.945]  And at the end, it's like time to turn all the guns in.
[00:37:44.965 --> 00:37:46.106]  The veterans are the terrorists.
[00:37:46.726 --> 00:37:48.187]  And of course, Weldon's an Air Force veteran.
[00:37:49.067 --> 00:37:52.808]  He was a bomb loader and worked on diagnostics and stuff.
[00:37:52.828 --> 00:37:56.209]  But the point is, believe me, that's a veteran.
[00:37:56.229 --> 00:37:57.110]  That's a dangerous job.
[00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:03.615]  So, all of this type of stuff goes on, and you get turned on television here, and you're the terrorist.
[00:38:04.055 --> 00:38:05.436]  And again, it hasn't happened yet.
[00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:11.601]  They've got actuaries, where they know vets aren't going to give your pension funds up, or your guns, and they're going to have a war with you.
[00:38:12.081 --> 00:38:17.146]  And so the targets are of veterans, and the manuals are of veterans, and the TV shows are of veterans.
[00:38:17.646 --> 00:38:18.767]  It's not just the four shows.
[00:38:18.807 --> 00:38:20.608]  Weldon said, you better watch some other TV show.
[00:38:20.648 --> 00:38:23.911]  It's not just Founding Fathers, and I Hate Paul Revere, and all this stuff.
[00:38:24.592 --> 00:38:25.592]  It's every show.
[00:38:25.693 --> 00:38:26.873]  Every show my wife watches.
[00:38:27.634 --> 00:38:29.595]  People that don't take vaccines are child molesters.
[00:38:29.795 --> 00:38:31.736]  People that don't take vaccines are child murderers.
[00:38:32.136 --> 00:38:34.136]  People that are concerned about the government are terrorists.
[00:38:34.677 --> 00:38:45.821]  And the general public, who doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground, can't find their butt with both hands, they're all being taught that those of us that are aware of this are the terrorists.
[00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:53.524]  And they're going to sick the general public on us when the Depression really gets bad and say, take everything they got and we'll turn the money back on.
[00:38:54.224 --> 00:38:56.205]  Pass Obamacare, we'll turn the money back on.
[00:38:56.425 --> 00:38:57.666]  They're like, I'm going bankrupt!
[00:38:57.706 --> 00:38:58.706]  It costs twice as much!
[00:38:58.966 --> 00:38:59.887]  Everything's shutting down!
[00:39:00.287 --> 00:39:01.528]  More socialism will fix it.
[00:39:01.588 --> 00:39:02.028]  Alright!
[00:39:02.568 --> 00:39:03.469]  Things are even worse!
[00:39:04.149 --> 00:39:05.269]  Communism will fix it.
[00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:06.010]  Okay!
[00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:07.430]  Things are even worse!
[00:39:07.491 --> 00:39:08.611]  Go to this forced labor camp.
[00:39:08.631 --> 00:39:09.431]  We'll feed you there.
[00:39:09.912 --> 00:39:10.292]  Alright!
[00:39:12.073 --> 00:39:14.614]  You'll be a jail guard and help kill your neighbors, you'll get food.
[00:39:14.714 --> 00:39:15.114]  Alright!
[00:39:15.594 --> 00:39:17.354]  This is how the authoritarians do it.
[00:39:17.594 --> 00:39:19.535]  And if you don't wake up to the mind control, it's over.
[00:39:19.575 --> 00:39:20.675]  Now, I said I'd take a bunch of calls.
[00:39:20.935 --> 00:39:21.776]  I'm gonna move quickly.
[00:39:22.016 --> 00:39:26.317]  I cannot let the callers distract me, even though they're great points, to go off in dissertations.
[00:39:26.637 --> 00:39:28.817]  Let's go to Chad in South Carolina.
[00:39:28.837 --> 00:39:29.658]  You're on the air, Chad.
[00:39:30.418 --> 00:39:38.540]  Hey Alex, it's funny you were just mentioning those shows because you asked what the next false flag would be, and I think it's gonna be power out, lights out.
[00:39:39.435 --> 00:39:45.318]  One reason I think that is the new NBC series, it's not new, but The Revolution, or Revolution.
[00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:48.840]  The lights go out and the economy collapses.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.281]  No, no, no.
[00:39:49.421 --> 00:39:55.004]  Every show, every movie is the race memory for humans to expect, because humans are adaptive.
[00:39:55.024 --> 00:39:56.045]  The globalists say this.
[00:39:56.405 --> 00:39:59.507]  They're going to teach us that mass death, mass collapse is coming.
[00:39:59.767 --> 00:40:04.429]  So as they engineer the slow collapse of 2021, we will expect it, yes.
[00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:09.052]  So, The Revolution, the American flag is the rebel flag.
[00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:15.163]  Guns have been banned, and it's just, they're putting this stuff out there, and we're going to get desensitized to it, like you said.
[00:40:15.303 --> 00:40:17.204]  No, it's total psych warfare on record.
[00:40:17.344 --> 00:40:29.188]  I read articles two weeks ago where the head UN official, at what, it was Stanford, gave a speech and admitted, we've used the cinema, the dramas, and the sitcoms to get rid of the family, now we're going to drop the hammer.
[00:40:29.708 --> 00:40:31.969]  It's an hour, ten minute video admitting it!
[00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:33.090]  Do you understand?
[00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:38.232]  If you're a new listener, it's not a liberal bias, it's an authoritarian takeover bias.
[00:40:38.272 --> 00:40:38.952]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:47.720]  So Fox News a couple days ago runs a show about China hacking the Intel network, or Intel, and it runs the power grid.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:53.006]  So they're saying, can you imagine what seven days on the East Coast, and they said East Coast, would be without power?
[00:40:54.268 --> 00:40:55.369]  And that's the thing, it's like...
[00:40:55.931 --> 00:40:59.934]  East Coast vs. West Coast, or Southeast vs. the rest of the United States.
[00:41:00.274 --> 00:41:07.500]  And by the way, the globalists, again, set up China, set up the communists, on record, it's declassified, publicly hiding in plain view.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.003]  The elite are working China against America, but America against China.
[00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:15.406]  They want to kill the Chinese people, they want to get rid of us as well.
[00:41:15.666 --> 00:41:18.208]  It's that global elite allied with China.
[00:41:18.488 --> 00:41:21.790]  It's the globalists allied with China against Russia.
[00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:22.871]  Russia's corrupt as well.
[00:41:23.232 --> 00:41:24.773]  China is allied, though,
[00:41:25.373 --> 00:41:26.973]  And I agree with Joel Skousen.
[00:41:27.013 --> 00:41:29.914]  They plan on flipping that alliance at some point.
[00:41:29.974 --> 00:41:32.175]  But remember, the globalists are eugenicists.
[00:41:32.535 --> 00:41:34.575]  They're playing everyone off against each other.
[00:41:34.995 --> 00:41:46.058]  And yes, they're getting us ready for a false flag to blame the patriots, hackers, or China for power outages when everyone knows the real power grid is not hooked up to the internet.
[00:41:46.518 --> 00:41:53.760]  Stuxnet with the Iranians had to be injected directly into the industrial energy transference grid centers.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.120]  The Load Balancing Centers.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.501]  It sounds exactly like a false flag.
[00:41:59.521 --> 00:42:04.342]  They're saying China can hack in and they can't even attack our grid.
[00:42:04.602 --> 00:42:05.703]  And it's total horse crap.
[00:42:06.063 --> 00:42:14.665]  And in fact, I think that was staged with the zombie hack, you know, up in Montana or Wyoming, where they hack into the TV station and go, zombies are taking over, the undead are rising from their graves.
[00:42:14.905 --> 00:42:20.286]  And that was hacking just the local computer for the federal EAS takeover system.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:25.624]  But as soon as the grid fails, you know the first thing is gonna be everybody turn in your guns.
[00:42:25.824 --> 00:42:26.865]  Just like Katrina.
[00:42:27.526 --> 00:42:29.107]  Just like any event, you know?
[00:42:29.648 --> 00:42:30.148]  No, that's it!
[00:42:30.188 --> 00:42:31.629]  They've set the default!
[00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.870]  Listen...
[00:42:33.168 --> 00:42:44.454]  Fourteen years ago, when I went to my first big urban warfare, it was 15 years ago, and I witnessed Marines trying to take our guns and training for America, and then I turned on CNN that night who'd been there.
[00:42:45.034 --> 00:42:51.037]  Troops are training for Macedonian conflict to help with UN peacekeepers in Oakland today.
[00:42:52.438 --> 00:42:57.903]  And I had all the footage, and the public was so weak-minded, when I put that film out, they said, that's gotta be fake.
[00:42:58.664 --> 00:43:06.350]  Even though it was real Marines, thousands of them, foreign troops, hovercraft, the Coronado, amphibious attack ship, helicopters.
[00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:12.656]  You understand, mainline conservatives said, that can't be real, this guy had $20 million.
[00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:19.342]  All ties together, the bullets, the paper cutout targets, all of it, it's all coming together.
[00:43:19.887 --> 00:43:22.931]  And it's happening a lot faster under Obama, like you said.
[00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:24.212]  It slowed down under Romney.
[00:43:24.773 --> 00:43:26.695]  And it's just in a hyperdrive under Obama.
[00:43:26.875 --> 00:43:29.818]  I appreciate you taking my call, Mr. Jones.
[00:43:30.419 --> 00:43:31.100]  God bless you, sir.
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.021]  I appreciate your call.
[00:43:32.101 --> 00:43:33.002]  And look, I'll be honest.
[00:43:34.003 --> 00:43:34.524]  I'll be honest.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:38.162]  And I've said this a thousand times, I'll say it for the thousands and first.
[00:43:38.722 --> 00:43:59.975]  If this was a boss hog tyranny, or it was some arrogant boss hog corrupt system and it wanted to own stuff and run things, but the old arrogant type of, I want the country rich and big businesses and big cars and, you know, and girls in bikinis and, I mean, that's kind of the tyranny in the 40s and 50s before the globalists totally took over completely, the technocrats.
[00:44:01.291 --> 00:44:03.153]  Was John Wayne and we're taking over.
[00:44:03.854 --> 00:44:05.376]  But that was still a boss hog corruption.
[00:44:05.716 --> 00:44:09.782]  I would be saying it was bad and I'd be against it, but I wouldn't be so desperate.
[00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:13.843]  Like a cat in a box that's been thrown in the river trying to scrabble out of it somehow.
[00:44:14.563 --> 00:44:15.263]  Before I drowned.
[00:44:16.064 --> 00:44:19.165]  These globalists are scientists.
[00:44:19.645 --> 00:44:20.886]  And they're all into studying.
[00:44:20.906 --> 00:44:25.228]  That's why all the internet grid, the surveillance grids, the tracking.
[00:44:25.248 --> 00:44:27.169]  It's all about predicting the future.
[00:44:27.189 --> 00:44:29.070]  It's all about the elite becoming God.
[00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:30.551]  It's all about the elite living forever.
[00:44:31.011 --> 00:44:33.652]  Zuckerberg and Brin joined forces to extend life.
[00:44:34.152 --> 00:44:34.413]  France 24.
[00:44:36.198 --> 00:44:41.520]  Announcing new $3 million initiative every year for whoever comes up with life extension technologies.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.081]  They find these things all the time.
[00:44:43.121 --> 00:44:44.922]  You hear about cures for this, cures for that.
[00:44:45.202 --> 00:44:46.742]  And they shelve them for the elite.
[00:44:47.923 --> 00:44:48.823]  They eat organic.
[00:44:49.123 --> 00:44:50.524]  They take clean vaccines.
[00:44:50.844 --> 00:44:52.044]  They get purified water.
[00:44:52.284 --> 00:44:53.685]  Their food's grown in greenhouses.
[00:44:54.225 --> 00:44:55.266]  While they kill you.
[00:44:57.096 --> 00:45:00.258]  The good news is, every weapon they release on us, they have to have a cure for.
[00:45:00.559 --> 00:45:02.540]  And it's easy to make a weapon, it's hard to have a cure.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:07.844]  So see, they're also scared that they might release something on us that'll mutate and get them, that's why they've got the bunkers.
[00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:10.586]  But all of this is a Moonraker scenario.
[00:45:10.606 --> 00:45:12.868]  But if they're not gonna go to space, they're gonna go underground.
[00:45:13.749 --> 00:45:17.672]  That's why Ian Fleming, the big MI6 OSS guy, wrote Moonraker.
[00:45:18.766 --> 00:45:32.915]  We guys look up when Ian Fleming, it had a different name, I think he wrote Moonraker in the 50s, where the elite industrialists release a bioweapon to kill everybody on Earth, but the bioweapon shuts down in one year, so they go off-world for one year to kill everybody to create the utopia.
[00:45:33.115 --> 00:45:33.816]  That's the plan!
[00:45:35.537 --> 00:45:37.038]  See, that isn't a movie, folks.
[00:45:37.198 --> 00:45:38.278]  That's their real plan.
[00:45:38.839 --> 00:45:40.180]  Just want to give you a little newsflash there.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.582]  Oh, how's your SWAT team uniform matter to you now?
[00:45:45.171 --> 00:45:46.692]  And a lot of cops are laughing right now.
[00:45:46.912 --> 00:45:48.993]  Your child, a lot of you listening, will be diagnosed with cancer.
[00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:51.915]  You might want to go check the cancer numbers after that happens.
[00:45:51.935 --> 00:45:52.776]  You're not going to listen now.
[00:45:53.236 --> 00:45:53.777]  Moonraker.
[00:45:53.797 --> 00:45:53.777]  1955.
[00:45:54.037 --> 00:45:54.337]  April 5th.
[00:45:54.357 --> 00:45:54.797]  Ian Fleming.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:04.847]  It's a third novel by British author Ian Fleming, featuring a fictional British Secret Service agent, Commander James Bond.
[00:46:05.227 --> 00:46:06.949]  Folks, you better learn about the truth, okay?
[00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:08.992]  Not knowing the truth will kill you.
[00:46:09.312 --> 00:46:15.539]  We got a chance to beat this, but the enemy has going for him the fact that this is so over the top.
[00:46:16.961 --> 00:46:18.463]  It's so over the top.
[00:46:21.141 --> 00:46:23.261]  That most people just can't get their minds around it.
[00:46:23.321 --> 00:46:24.582]  The truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:46:25.362 --> 00:46:26.322]  Michael in New York.
[00:46:26.482 --> 00:46:28.163]  People come together is what you want to talk about.
[00:46:28.203 --> 00:46:28.543]  Go ahead.
[00:46:29.543 --> 00:46:30.063]  Or Michelle.
[00:46:31.303 --> 00:46:32.023]  Hi, Alex.
[00:46:32.684 --> 00:46:33.824]  Nice to talk to you.
[00:46:33.904 --> 00:46:35.184]  I've been following you for years.
[00:46:35.464 --> 00:46:38.585]  You know, I think something really important for everyone to look at.
[00:46:38.665 --> 00:46:39.705]  It's a very simple thing.
[00:46:40.085 --> 00:46:43.806]  They've been using psychology, these psychopaths, against us for years.
[00:46:43.846 --> 00:46:46.146]  You know, starting back way before Willie Lynch.
[00:46:46.747 --> 00:46:48.287]  And that's why they have us all running now.
[00:46:48.769 --> 00:46:50.490]  We don't communicate with one another.
[00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:55.014]  And you know, you're Republican, so I'm not going to talk to you, but you know what?
[00:46:55.114 --> 00:46:57.296]  We all share the same oppressors.
[00:46:58.157 --> 00:47:03.761]  And, you know, people may think they have the right answer, and it's hard to tell them, you're wrong.
[00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:10.226]  But if you tell them, I share the same oppressor as you, and I may not agree with you, but let's talk.
[00:47:10.626 --> 00:47:11.707]  We need to break bread.
[00:47:11.767 --> 00:47:12.688]  We need to sit down.
[00:47:12.728 --> 00:47:13.509]  We need to talk.
[00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:15.430]  We need to stop fighting with each other.
[00:47:16.909 --> 00:47:21.313]  I tend to get frustrated often times with people, but I try to communicate.
[00:47:21.373 --> 00:47:23.494]  I try to spread the word and talk.
[00:47:23.614 --> 00:47:24.315]  And that's the key.
[00:47:24.415 --> 00:47:27.738]  Our society, they've got us watching this crap on television.
[00:47:28.258 --> 00:47:32.181]  They've got us distracted with cell phones and all this other stuff that's not important.
[00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:34.883]  No, nothing is allowed to be rolled out and made popular.
[00:47:35.244 --> 00:47:36.344]  Some things still squeak out.
[00:47:36.364 --> 00:47:38.586]  That's why they want a world government to clamp down and have full control.
[00:47:38.806 --> 00:47:39.907]  They don't have full control yet.
[00:47:40.348 --> 00:47:41.168]  That's the good news.
[00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:42.890]  The bad news is they've got
[00:47:44.019 --> 00:47:44.619]  Absolutely.
[00:47:44.639 --> 00:47:46.040]  I agree completely.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:46.860]  I agree completely.
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:52.902]  And something I try to do is just help other people spread the word and, you know, and get ready because it's getting worse every day.
[00:47:52.942 --> 00:47:57.063]  You know, I've been telling people for years, I worked with youth for many years,
[00:48:12.125 --> 00:48:15.948]  And I would tell them, and I would say, don't believe me, but don't believe them.
[00:48:15.968 --> 00:48:19.971]  Do your own research, you know, and it's getting scary.
[00:48:20.211 --> 00:48:21.112]  It's getting really scary.
[00:48:21.172 --> 00:48:29.938]  I see bugs bunning in the soup pot, and the fire's going around them, and the vegetables are in, and I see most of America tasting the stock and saying, ooh, this tastes good.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:32.760]  And they need to get out of the stock pot and do something.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.701]  Now, I hear you.
[00:48:33.761 --> 00:48:34.942]  Good, good analogy.
[00:48:34.962 --> 00:48:36.083]  Time to get out of the pot.
[00:48:36.103 --> 00:48:40.086]  You're going around cooking us like the Wicked Witch and Hansel and Gretel.
[00:48:41.476 --> 00:48:42.556]  I mean, just look at The Globalist.
[00:48:42.596 --> 00:48:43.777]  It's the Wicked Witch, folks.
[00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:52.959]  They bought $2 million worth of targets of little kids for the police to shoot, and then they defend it?
[00:48:53.619 --> 00:48:54.699]  The company defends it.
[00:48:54.879 --> 00:48:56.380]  It says, well, Homeland Security asked for this.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.020]  The bullets are for us.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.460]  And it's not just the targets.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.381]  We have the manuals.
[00:49:00.421 --> 00:49:00.901]  We have it all.
[00:49:01.835 --> 00:49:04.117]  Wayne in New Jersey, thanks for holding your on the air.
[00:49:04.717 --> 00:49:05.678]  How's it going, Alex?
[00:49:05.778 --> 00:49:08.500]  You and Joel Skousen do some great work.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:17.466]  In reference to the DHS targets, one of your other callers had said that those were the not-to-shoot targets.
[00:49:17.606 --> 00:49:18.346]  No, no, no, no.
[00:49:18.406 --> 00:49:19.467]  It says to shoot.
[00:49:19.507 --> 00:49:20.688]  It says no hesitation.
[00:49:21.048 --> 00:49:22.809]  Under it, this may be something you face.
[00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:24.510]  Right, I understand that.
[00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.912]  Back in the day, that's what it used to be.
[00:49:27.632 --> 00:49:29.554]  They'd put it up in like a Hogan's Alley.
[00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:31.110]  And that would come up.
[00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:33.832]  Sure, but do you see how people automatically spin everything?
[00:49:33.892 --> 00:49:35.393]  Like, first it can't be a real story.
[00:49:35.433 --> 00:49:37.574]  Well then, no, no, you don't shoot the pregnant lady.
[00:49:37.634 --> 00:49:43.437]  No, it says, non-traditional target, uh, depicting a hostile pregnant woman in a nursery.
[00:49:43.457 --> 00:49:45.598]  I understand that.
[00:49:45.838 --> 00:49:48.500]  It's very dangerous, what they're doing right now.
[00:49:50.361 --> 00:49:52.622]  And it says, this is to train you to take out the threat.
[00:49:52.702 --> 00:49:55.504]  I mean, it says it in English and people can't believe it.
[00:49:56.664 --> 00:49:58.645]  But, do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:49:58.665 --> 00:49:58.905]  Yes.
[00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:05.470]  No, it's a total... until four years ago, you never gave a pregnant woman a vaccine.
[00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:11.692]  They knew it caused spontaneous miscarriages, and if the baby lived, it would brain damage them.
[00:50:11.712 --> 00:50:14.912]  Now they say, oh, pregnant women need more shots.
[00:50:16.973 --> 00:50:17.473]  You understand?
[00:50:17.493 --> 00:50:19.134]  They're just seeing what they can get away with.
[00:50:19.714 --> 00:50:23.695]  We need a modern-day version of Thomas Paine's common sense.
[00:50:23.855 --> 00:50:24.515]  That's what we need.
[00:50:25.233 --> 00:50:27.694]  We need to realize the enemy runs the government.
[00:50:28.174 --> 00:50:32.476]  That doesn't mean everybody in it, but the people running it are super evil.
[00:50:32.556 --> 00:50:46.462]  It just needs to be a mass awakening that, my God, we've got a bunch of psych warfare chiefs who are weird, anti-family, anti-human, power-tripping nuts who think they're going to merge with machines and become God in charge, and they're spiking the food and water.
[00:50:47.122 --> 00:50:51.405]  And they're killing people all over the world, cutting their food off, and they're absolutely out of control.
[00:50:51.445 --> 00:50:52.226]  Great points, Wayne.
[00:50:52.706 --> 00:50:55.688]  Derek, Michael, Jeremy, everybody else, your calls are coming up.
[00:50:55.708 --> 00:50:55.748]  800-259-9231.
[00:50:55.768 --> 00:50:56.048]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.161]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:05.003]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[00:51:05.203 --> 00:51:07.284]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[00:51:07.544 --> 00:51:09.086]  What can you not live without?
[00:51:09.246 --> 00:51:10.687]  What is your greatest dependency?
[00:51:10.967 --> 00:51:11.668]  Is it your guns?
[00:51:11.948 --> 00:51:12.568]  Is it your home?
[00:51:12.909 --> 00:51:14.010]  No, it's food.
[00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:16.211]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:19.734]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[00:51:19.934 --> 00:51:21.015]  Don't be dependent.
[00:51:21.175 --> 00:51:22.116]  Be self-sufficient.
[00:51:22.276 --> 00:51:23.837]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[00:51:23.937 --> 00:51:24.598]  Feed yourself.
[00:51:25.038 --> 00:51:27.138]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:51:27.258 --> 00:51:30.599]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:51:30.819 --> 00:51:33.440]  It's the best long-term storable food on the planet.

[00:52:01.189 --> 00:52:04.051]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:07.653]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:52:07.733 --> 00:52:10.575]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[00:52:10.715 --> 00:52:21.541]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[00:52:21.641 --> 00:52:22.702]  Then there's affordability.

[00:52:27.585 --> 00:52:28.805]  Even stagnant pond water.

[00:52:34.948 --> 00:52:37.709]  No need to be constantly replacing expensive filters with a Berkey.
[00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:40.210]  A single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.

[00:53:03.058 --> 00:53:06.139]  Allergies and crippling immune diseases are on the rise.
[00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:11.120]  Vaccines, radiation, and GMOs lead the charge against your health.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:16.141]  Fortunately, health conscious consumers are enlisting the help of RNA drops.

[00:53:44.796 --> 00:53:45.357]  Federal agents!
[00:53:45.377 --> 00:53:46.258]  We are armed!
[00:54:04.952 --> 00:54:14.915]  Alright, I'm going to continue with your calls in this segment and the next.
[00:54:14.935 --> 00:54:26.519]  Then I'm going to get into the second American revolution and what we've got to do to restore the republic.
[00:54:35.725 --> 00:54:39.362]  Because I've got a message to the criminal foreign crime syndicates that run our government.
[00:54:40.307 --> 00:54:45.791]  I sit here and I watch, and I study what you do every single day, and I watch all the horrible things you do.
[00:54:45.851 --> 00:54:58.080]  I know you brag how it's an attribute to be cold-blooded and exterminate humans that are a disease on the face of the earth, and I see you selling that idea to the public so we'll think of ourselves as trash and roll over and die, but that's not going to happen.
[00:54:58.781 --> 00:55:02.283]  I read the book World War Z, because it's a big Brad Pitt film coming out.
[00:55:03.204 --> 00:55:09.729]  The film reportedly is in trouble with re-edits and things, but it's just all about
[00:55:11.837 --> 00:55:14.998]  It was actually great that the zombies came to reduce population.
[00:55:15.398 --> 00:55:17.259]  What we needed was a Marxist system.
[00:55:18.219 --> 00:55:23.361]  And so it helped bring the UN and the world power that the zombies took over, because they weren't the real threat.
[00:55:23.701 --> 00:55:25.362]  The real threat was the individuals.
[00:55:26.763 --> 00:55:30.904]  You're not listening to Mark Hamill of Star Wars, because I also listen to the book on tape.
[00:55:33.125 --> 00:55:35.926]  In that fake New York accent, or East Coast accent,
[00:55:38.188 --> 00:55:41.669]  You know, my dad, I didn't listen to him about Marxism, but he was right.
[00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:44.631]  And the UN knew how to deal with the American gun owners.
[00:55:44.971 --> 00:55:45.931]  We hunted them down.
[00:55:46.311 --> 00:55:47.652]  The zombies were our friends.
[00:55:47.952 --> 00:55:49.953]  They helped deal with the gun owners as well.
[00:55:52.054 --> 00:55:54.135]  I mean, it's every movie, TV show.
[00:55:54.935 --> 00:55:56.436]  It's the veterans, the gun owners.
[00:55:56.456 --> 00:55:57.836]  They're the enemy.
[00:55:57.896 --> 00:56:01.058]  I mean, the government is a foreign occupying power!
[00:56:01.378 --> 00:56:02.098]  Period!
[00:56:02.858 --> 00:56:03.539]  Period!
[00:56:03.899 --> 00:56:04.479]  Period!
[00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.874]  And I know a lot of Americans are going to follow orders right into the pit of hell.
[00:56:11.235 --> 00:56:12.757]  But a lot of us are not going to do it.
[00:56:12.997 --> 00:56:17.542]  So let me just tell all the minions out there, you're not going to get away with this without one hell of a fight.
[00:56:17.823 --> 00:56:19.084]  Just get that through your pea brain.
[00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:26.113]  And I don't want to see you cut down.
[00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:31.475]  I don't want to see this engineered civil war they've got all geared up and primed and ready.
[00:56:31.695 --> 00:56:39.505]  But they don't have almost every drama and show on TV getting ready for civil war and collapse and that the enemy's the gun owners because they're going to play tiddlywinks.
[00:56:40.066 --> 00:56:43.250]  This is a real operational program that they are considering hammering.
[00:56:44.059 --> 00:56:45.500]  They got multiple programs going.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.783]  But right before 9-11, they said, here's Bin Laden, he's gonna get you.
[00:56:49.043 --> 00:56:50.064]  What do you do when he attacks?
[00:56:50.104 --> 00:56:50.785]  Give your rights up.
[00:56:51.025 --> 00:56:52.086]  I saw the pre-programming.
[00:56:52.266 --> 00:56:54.108]  It's how I was able to say they were gonna stage an attack.
[00:56:54.308 --> 00:56:55.609]  Doesn't mean there aren't Muslim extremists.
[00:56:55.769 --> 00:56:57.090]  Doesn't mean Al-Qaeda isn't real.
[00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:57.951]  The globalists created it.
[00:56:58.131 --> 00:56:58.792]  They run it today.
[00:56:59.172 --> 00:57:03.656]  Criminal globalist elements infiltrating our government, working with Al-Qaeda.
[00:57:03.856 --> 00:57:10.062]  Just like FBI doesn't know they work for the globalists, the average Al-Qaeda extremist actually thinks they're fighting for Allah.
[00:57:12.375 --> 00:57:15.940]  It's compartmentalization where the globalists run all the sides.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.382]  Do you understand that?
[00:57:17.462 --> 00:57:19.084]  If you don't get that, it's over.
[00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:20.306]  I'm gonna go to break.
[00:57:20.366 --> 00:57:22.669]  I'm gonna come back with some of your phone calls.
[00:57:25.473 --> 00:57:26.914]  Don't forget our broadcast.
[00:57:28.602 --> 00:57:29.503]  Is Lister supported?
[00:57:29.543 --> 00:57:32.926]  When you buy the books, the videos, the tapes, the t-shirts, info or store.com.
[00:57:33.326 --> 00:57:41.514]  Three new films we're carrying that are very powerful, Behold a Pale Horse, America's Last Chance, with Charlie Daniels, amazing, General Boykin and others, and Exposing the New World Order.
[00:57:41.814 --> 00:57:44.796]  This is great to get mainline conservatives to wake up to the New World Order, Agenda 21.
[00:57:46.738 --> 00:57:51.503]  A noble lie to understand false flag terror and Clinton's involvement and the Attorney General's involvement.
[00:57:52.124 --> 00:57:53.725]  He was Deputy Attorney General at the time.
[00:57:54.005 --> 00:57:57.209]  To wake Christians up, the tribulation is being used as a cop-out.
[00:57:57.649 --> 00:58:00.572]  After the tribulation, let no man be deceived.
[00:58:00.612 --> 00:58:01.253]  Very well done.
[00:58:01.273 --> 00:58:05.016]  Our best-selling film, we're selling right now at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:58:43.768 --> 00:58:47.732]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:58:54.905 --> 00:59:00.349]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[00:59:56.363 --> 00:59:59.204]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.767 --> 01:00:06.427]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.068 --> 01:00:08.128]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.848 --> 01:00:10.009]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:11.409]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:13.690]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:17.372]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.912 --> 01:00:21.994]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:29.246]  Make no mistake, our greatest success of this transmission is that more and more we're able to shape the debate.
[01:00:30.588 --> 01:00:37.774]  And it's an incredible responsibility, and I want to say I'm thankful for it, but quite frankly, didn't even want this job.
[01:00:38.775 --> 01:00:39.896]  That's why I've been successful.
[01:00:39.956 --> 01:00:44.180]  I got involved in this because I believed in liberty and didn't want to live under slavery.
[01:00:44.981 --> 01:00:47.664]  I didn't get involved in media like most people to be a big shot.
[01:00:48.817 --> 01:00:53.721]  I got involved in media and crawled my way up to this point out of a dedication to freedom.
[01:00:53.801 --> 01:00:55.942]  And I know that's why you're listening and that's why you're involved.
[01:00:56.303 --> 01:00:56.883]  God bless you.
[01:00:57.263 --> 01:01:01.447]  Key information coming up in the next segment dealing with the Second American Revolution.
[01:01:01.907 --> 01:01:02.688]  Will it be peaceful?
[01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:03.508]  Will it be violent?
[01:01:03.608 --> 01:01:05.069]  How do we turn this republic around?
[01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:08.712]  The most weighty of subjects will be carried and covered in the next segment.
[01:01:08.732 --> 01:01:11.334]  Let's go to phone calls right now.
[01:01:12.355 --> 01:01:14.477]  Let's go to Scotty in Iowa.
[01:01:14.957 --> 01:01:16.678]  Scotty in Iowa, you're on the air.
[01:01:16.718 --> 01:01:17.279]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:18.646 --> 01:01:34.337]  Hi, um, I wanted to ask your opinion on, uh, my, uh, I have some family members who in the military, they're in the army and they were saying how Obama's making this new rule that if the enemy is not, does not have a weapon in their hand, you can't shoot them.
[01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:43.244]  And one of my cousins had one of his men get stabbed, or I shouldn't say stabbed, had an enemy had a machete and hit him in the head.
[01:01:44.161 --> 01:01:45.682]  Yeah, well, that's all part of PR.
[01:01:45.922 --> 01:01:48.423]  Obama will say, I'm anti-war, give me a peace prize.
[01:01:48.924 --> 01:02:00.210]  You know, you've got to put pink hearts on the sides of the bullets before you fire them, while he has drones blowing up whole buildings and saying it's collateral damage to kill 200 people and only kill one bad guy, they claim.
[01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.791]  So that's all just PR baloney.
[01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:11.016]  And they're just getting ready to politically correct the military, put women in frontline combat, pulling crosses out of the chapels.
[01:02:11.836 --> 01:02:13.757]  Uh, because they want to phase it out in the next decade.
[01:02:13.777 --> 01:02:15.118]  They're going to go purely to robots.
[01:02:15.818 --> 01:02:29.926]  And then you'll just have people literally in pink outfits prancing around there to back up the robots at the, uh, attack factories and the mobile, uh, but they plan to have these giant floating fortresses that are the size of like 10 giant oil drilling refineries.
[01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.846]  Or oil drilling platforms.
[01:02:32.866 --> 01:02:33.787]  This is an official plan.
[01:02:34.108 --> 01:02:36.271]  Floating fortresses directly out of 1984.
[01:02:36.731 --> 01:02:40.136]  Guys, look up Pentagon plans and NATO plans giant floating fortresses.
[01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:46.424]  And then they're going to have robot repair factories on those with big robot Ospreys and other attack craft that take off.
[01:02:46.784 --> 01:02:47.124]  We're good to go.
[01:03:17.301 --> 01:03:17.821]  Just get rid of us.
[01:03:17.841 --> 01:03:18.481]  We're not needed anymore.
[01:03:18.821 --> 01:03:19.802]  They officially said they're going to kill us.
[01:03:19.822 --> 01:03:20.662]  What do you think about that?
[01:03:20.682 --> 01:03:23.983]  That's insane.
[01:03:24.723 --> 01:03:33.906]  Another thing that I had a question on is some of my family members think that what Obama's doing is he's sending out some of our troops little by little and that he's creating his own army?
[01:03:34.766 --> 01:03:35.286]  No, no, no.
[01:03:35.506 --> 01:03:36.727]  They're creating their own.
[01:03:37.027 --> 01:03:42.188]  Well, there will be combat troops in each nation because, you know, it's fun to torture and kill people.
[01:03:42.609 --> 01:03:44.849]  So the Soviets all have their own uniforms.
[01:03:45.169 --> 01:03:46.650]  The new neo-Soviet.
[01:03:47.412 --> 01:03:48.413]  That's just what my main question was.
[01:04:16.011 --> 01:04:19.952]  I mean, the heirs were in the meetings, came out, and then the core people went to jail over it.
[01:04:19.972 --> 01:04:24.034]  And they said, we're going to put 50 million libertarians and conservatives in camps.
[01:04:24.054 --> 01:04:25.194]  We're going to kill at least half of them.
[01:04:25.634 --> 01:04:27.695]  And that was back when our population was 200 million.
[01:04:28.795 --> 01:04:30.876]  Back in the 70s, it's now 315 million.
[01:04:31.256 --> 01:04:33.277]  So you got to look at them killing about 80 million people.
[01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:39.338]  Or putting 80 million in re-education camps, which are really just big party houses for psychopaths.
[01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:44.799]  See, psychopaths have their biggest kind of like chili cook-offs when they have a big government.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:55.262]  Psychopaths, the smart ones, build a big government because they can kill and steal on the way up, but then they have a big blood party at the end of it, like Hitler and Lenin and Stalin and Mao had.
[01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:58.503]  And Mao killed 65 to 85 million, no one really knows.
[01:04:58.543 --> 01:05:00.043]  And it's just all a big party.
[01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:02.668]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:07:00.569 --> 01:07:07.533]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:25.403]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:07:25.664 --> 01:07:29.786]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.627]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:07:31.827 --> 01:07:39.673]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:08:08.909 --> 01:08:10.149]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:11.470]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:13.090]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.791 --> 01:08:17.392]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.992 --> 01:08:22.113]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.674 --> 01:08:26.935]  Thank you for joining us on this Thursday edition.
[01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:29.606]  We're now into the second hour.
[01:08:29.666 --> 01:08:31.806]  We're here Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m.

[01:08:59.098 --> 01:09:03.140]  Okay, coming up, I'll get two more of your calls.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:07.703]  Jeremy and Jason and John and Sean and Charles and everyone that is patiently holding.
[01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:15.947]  And I'm going to get into John Kerry, the new Secretary of State's first initiative, is the global carbon tax and shutting down what's left of American industry.
[01:09:15.967 --> 01:09:17.988]  We're going to be getting to that.
[01:09:18.808 --> 01:09:28.351]  We're also going to be looking at the economy in depth and how they're trying to hide inflation with horse meat and fake fish and the rest of it, that new scandal.
[01:09:29.371 --> 01:09:30.732]  Breaking as well.
[01:09:30.752 --> 01:09:36.716]  I also want to look at life extension technologies that the globalists have been suppressing.
[01:09:37.417 --> 01:09:41.660]  That's just some of what we're going to be covering here today.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:56.830]  But if you remember, a few weeks after Obama was re-elected, I made the call for a second American revolution.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:21.210]  I made the call for a second American Revolution, but I was very clear that via the Declaration of Independence, and to quote our founding documents, July 4th, 1776, in the Continental Congress, that it is our right and our duty to throw off an oppressive government that becomes destructive
[01:10:23.047 --> 01:10:28.852]  Of the basic aims of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, due process, private property, things like that.
[01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:38.241]  And if you look at the long train of abuses, that's exactly what we're facing today, by an order of magnitude, conservatively.
[01:10:41.043 --> 01:10:43.205]  And America is a conquered country.
[01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:46.688]  Foreign globalist interests brag, I wrote an article,
[01:10:47.796 --> 01:10:54.841]  A few months ago, with Paul Watson, it's a very important article titled, Banksters Declare They've Conquered the United States and Europe.
[01:10:55.081 --> 01:11:04.868]  And it's got more than 15, 16 different videos and links to world leaders saying, the new world order is run by private banks, we've conquered you.
[01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:06.109]  And they're not free market.
[01:11:06.129 --> 01:11:07.290]  They didn't buy the world.
[01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:12.914]  They took over the world by paying off politicians and then having them sign us onto their debt.
[01:11:14.164 --> 01:11:19.906]  And only Iceland has said no and kicked the banksters out and actually arrested their bankers who were involved in the fraud.
[01:11:20.366 --> 01:11:21.826]  That's the only course.
[01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:31.990]  Now, to understand the fact that there is a solution and there is a way to beat these people, you need to first look at the enemy's attack profile.
[01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:35.991]  What is the New World Order Global Corporate Mafia?
[01:11:37.062 --> 01:11:58.771]  Based in Europe, England, and the United States, dominating most of the world, paying off most of the Russians in a power-sharing deal with the Communist Chinese under a eugenics agreement, agreed on in 1949 that Mao would kill a large portion of his population, later codified under one child in 1975 with Ambassador Bush.
[01:12:02.591 --> 01:12:13.794]  Now under that power axis, they're mopping up a few Arab countries, they're mopping up a few Eastern European countries, a few African countries, they're mopping up here and there.
[01:12:14.395 --> 01:12:20.697]  But the whole world points out, hey, the big funder of the empire, the big once wealthy republic,
[01:12:25.782 --> 01:12:44.408]  You've still got your guns, you've still got some private property, you've got a federal tax of around 40% when it's a 75% or more in France that's the model, and Obama's hired not one but two socialist, globalist, French economists to come over here and run things.
[01:12:44.448 --> 01:12:45.408]  You saw that a few months ago.
[01:12:47.401 --> 01:13:10.989]  They're saying under the OECD, that's the real global banking receivership arm that they use to bring Europe under receivership during the Marshall Plan, that is the Organization of Economic and Cooperative Development via the Ex-Im Bank, IMF, and World Bank, through the local consortiums, Bank of England, Private Fellow Reserve, and other systems.
[01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:15.491]  They are here to bankrupt the world system.
[01:13:17.327 --> 01:13:20.228]  And to end the family, to make you so poor you can't afford to have children.
[01:13:20.828 --> 01:13:23.009]  And to worry if you're poor, you're not going to be allowed to have children.
[01:13:25.169 --> 01:13:33.832]  And they've actually paid the welfare system to create a giant horde of disenfranchised, dumbed down, fluoride heads to actually be their weapons system.
[01:13:34.132 --> 01:13:34.792]  See, the eugenics...
[01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:37.217]  is a balanced system.
[01:13:37.277 --> 01:13:59.507]  It's an algorithm to exterminate a certain number of the undesirables while also producing another group that will form the basis of your takeover army against your real enemy, the middle class, i.e., high IQ genetic groups, which can come from any so-called race.
[01:14:00.578 --> 01:14:09.022]  That in their structure algorithm studies would form a threat to the overall in-game takeover scenario.
[01:14:09.342 --> 01:14:13.323]  Now when I start to get into all this, it gets very technical.
[01:14:13.704 --> 01:14:15.604]  And I'm going off schematics in my mind.
[01:14:16.065 --> 01:14:20.286]  And of course I've made a film on it almost seven years ago, in-game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:14:21.447 --> 01:14:23.168]  But I can get lost in the minutia.
[01:14:23.188 --> 01:14:26.189]  Let me just reset and put it to you this way.
[01:14:27.113 --> 01:14:32.059]  There's a global corporate empire who doesn't just want to conquer you.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:46.617]  Once it's in place, it is a scientific technocracy following a mindset based on Malthusian systems of exterminism.
[01:14:47.887 --> 01:14:59.489]  Or what would be called, in modern terminology, a universal, ultra-Hitlerian program of mass genocide against over 90% of the world's population.
[01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:03.830]  Now, we face that.
[01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:05.010]  That's their game plan.
[01:15:05.511 --> 01:15:10.972]  And they want control of the resources and control of the society to be able to carry that program out.
[01:15:11.872 --> 01:15:12.312]  And to
[01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:18.896]  Do that, they've also dumbed the population down, created artificial arrested development.
[01:15:20.417 --> 01:15:30.279]  They have poisoned culturally, spiritually, but also physically the general population, as Thomas Robert Malthus called for.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:37.261]  In what about the year 1800, roughly, was when he put out one of his major theses.
[01:15:38.461 --> 01:15:41.522]  1898 was the first publishing date of that.
[01:15:42.523 --> 01:15:44.407]  The essay on the principle of population.
[01:15:44.727 --> 01:15:49.557]  And he said poison them, release bio-weapons on them, dumb them down.
[01:15:49.877 --> 01:15:53.624]  He said ship them to the colonies for slave labor.
[01:15:56.246 --> 01:16:13.214]  In fact, there's famous British Army colonel manuals that are in the Smithsonian where they talk about how to incubate the smallpox, how to pop the sores properly, how to lay it on the blankets and then quickly, because it's fresher that way and has a better kill ratio, give that to the Indians.
[01:16:14.235 --> 01:16:16.756]  Oh, you see, that's 200 plus years ago.
[01:16:18.197 --> 01:16:20.918]  They give you vaccines today that kill you 20 years down the road.
[01:16:24.517 --> 01:16:26.618]  And again, I know this is so nightmarish.
[01:16:26.718 --> 01:16:28.679]  I mean, I know it's crazy, but it's real.
[01:16:28.759 --> 01:16:31.420]  I mean, it's what you find when you go study the real history.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.501]  And there is no return from this unless we wake up to it.
[01:16:35.761 --> 01:16:37.202]  There's no future for our children.
[01:16:37.542 --> 01:16:38.702]  There's no future for anybody.
[01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:48.866]  And I want to warn those of you out there who serve the establishment on the so-called right and left, who think that you're just going to go quietly into the night and that you're going to be part of the winning team.
[01:16:49.646 --> 01:16:53.568]  There could be two exterminist, anti-human haters
[01:16:55.009 --> 01:17:02.933]  There could be two high priests of the New World Order together in a high mountain temple when they've exterminated the entire world population.
[01:17:03.613 --> 01:17:19.661]  If there was two of them, two biomechanical monsters, because that's what they believe they're going to turn into, standing at the ultimate pinnacle of exterminist, nihilistic flagellation, they would kill each other.
[01:17:22.566 --> 01:17:39.007]  So, I know where this leads historically, I know where this leads spiritually, I know where this leads physically, I know where this leads intellectually, but in my gut and in my spirit and every level, there is no turning back for many of you I know.
[01:17:40.054 --> 01:17:45.738]  But for many of you who are compartmentalized, you're listening right now and you know what I'm saying's true.
[01:17:46.098 --> 01:17:50.041]  Not because you know I've done my research, but because you're part of it.
[01:17:50.742 --> 01:17:55.305]  I think that right now the question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[01:17:55.345 --> 01:17:57.547]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.148]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:18:00.248 --> 01:18:02.729]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[01:18:02.749 --> 01:18:07.610]  Jim Muriel, you say we've got some downside here, a correction in the markets.
[01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:08.070]  Fine.
[01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:11.892]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:18:11.992 --> 01:18:20.334]  Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt and that we won't go any lower than, say, 5% down from here?
[01:18:20.474 --> 01:18:25.236]  Of course we are, because of... And then the rest of them go through the fact that they agree with him.
[01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:29.413]  Yeah, the Federal Reserve's our master, but it doesn't matter, they're in control.
[01:18:29.473 --> 01:18:30.174]  That's the way it is.
[01:18:31.034 --> 01:18:38.601]  And that's like the alien spacecraft arriving at Earth and your television sets go, pshhh, I am Gorgon.
[01:18:39.161 --> 01:18:40.603]  We have come to capture your planet.
[01:18:40.663 --> 01:18:46.688]  We will destroy your planet, as we've done countless others, if you do not submit immediately to us.
[01:18:49.161 --> 01:19:05.005]  And they're all over the news announcing we're slaves, while having dramas and sitcoms and movies and police training manuals where they tell you, this doesn't exist, the banking takeover doesn't exist, terrorists say it exists, and they're going to blow stuff up.
[01:19:05.485 --> 01:19:09.386]  No, the globalists are going to blow stuff up, and then try to come arrest all of us.
[01:19:09.406 --> 01:19:14.668]  So when we come back, I'll break down just some of my thoughts and ideas.
[01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:32.610]  Talking points from my research and history of how we can really kick start a resistance before it gets physical and really cause a real cultural revolution, a cultural seismic awakening.
[01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:36.113]  And it either happens that way explosively or it doesn't happen.
[01:19:36.853 --> 01:19:38.875]  The globalists know how easily this can happen.
[01:19:39.989 --> 01:19:49.120]  All we have to do is speak to the human instinct of survival that beats in the hearts and the minds of most of the minions of the system who are going to be destroyed as well.
[01:19:49.661 --> 01:19:52.284]  We just have to get the message out and it's game over.
[01:19:52.525 --> 01:19:54.787]  We've beaten the tyrants countless times before.
[01:19:55.328 --> 01:19:58.192]  We'll beat them this time again if God is with us.
[01:20:01.167 --> 01:20:02.788]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:21:01.348 --> 01:21:02.970]  Hey everybody, Ty Bollinger here.
[01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:05.412]  Once again, real life, real stories.
[01:21:05.812 --> 01:21:07.193]  And he discovered Carnivora.
[01:21:07.714 --> 01:21:12.418]  Was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his family and his friends and his patients.
[01:21:12.698 --> 01:21:15.100]  My dad was a family physician, he was a medical doctor.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.983]  Almost all the symptoms were either diminished or gone.
[01:21:18.003 --> 01:21:20.085]  Amazing product, amazing result.
[01:21:20.225 --> 01:21:27.488]  It's like an amazing thing having such a profound change in how I feel and knowing that it was the carnivora that did it.
[01:21:27.808 --> 01:21:33.871]  And a lot of patients got better, ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.
[01:21:34.111 --> 01:21:41.114]  Here's the toll-free telephone number to call to access the Carnivora Telecast at carnivora.com on Tuesday, March 12th, 8 p.m.

[01:22:00.572 --> 01:22:02.533]  I lost 18 pounds in just four days.
[01:22:02.693 --> 01:22:03.854]  Hi, I'm James Zetta.
[01:22:03.934 --> 01:22:07.295]  If you're like me, you've already tried and failed at many diet and weight loss plans.
[01:22:07.476 --> 01:22:15.380]  The 18 in 4 weight loss plan requires no exercising, no diet pills or additives, no laxatives, no meal replacements, and no diet drinks.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:20.362]  The 18 in 4 program is crystal clear with a day-to-day, step-by-step, and meal-to-meal guide.
[01:22:20.462 --> 01:22:24.764]  If you're not satisfied with your results, I will give you my 30-day full money-back guarantee.
[01:22:24.884 --> 01:22:25.565]  Go to 18in4.com.
[01:22:25.585 --> 01:22:26.585]  That's the number 18.
[01:22:26.725 --> 01:22:27.366]  I N the number 4.com.
[01:22:30.287 --> 01:22:39.553]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:39.613 --> 01:22:40.354]  This capitalism?
[01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:46.558]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:46.698 --> 01:22:47.458]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:47.499 --> 01:22:50.581]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:50.641 --> 01:22:51.541]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.561 --> 01:22:52.922]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:22:52.982 --> 01:22:53.242]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:53.563]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.868 --> 01:23:03.329]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:08.712]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:23:09.172 --> 01:23:10.573]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:23:10.993 --> 01:23:15.696]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[01:23:16.256 --> 01:23:23.441]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:26.522]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:23:27.082 --> 01:23:30.243]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:23:30.863 --> 01:23:38.965]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:23:39.405 --> 01:23:49.548]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:23:50.309 --> 01:23:55.144]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[01:23:55.645 --> 01:23:57.671]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[01:24:11.548 --> 01:24:20.350]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, your calls and a ton of news are coming up, but I'm basically trying to break down how the world works, what the driving philosophy of the controllers are.
[01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:33.273]  So they've gone for 50 years saying, oh, the John Birch Society, the lying demons, because it was only the John Birch Society in the 50s and 60s that was even covering any of this.
[01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:40.362]  And so they would go, oh, those crazy conspiracy theorists, they say our government put Mao in, oh!
[01:24:40.822 --> 01:24:42.584]  All been declassified in the mid-90s.
[01:24:44.326 --> 01:24:47.589]  CIA put him in 1949, declassified, go look it up.
[01:24:48.206 --> 01:24:49.466]  Biggest mass murder in history.
[01:24:49.807 --> 01:24:50.627]  One in communism.
[01:24:51.287 --> 01:24:54.248]  Nixon was just making public a deal that was already done.
[01:24:54.668 --> 01:24:55.929]  And that isn't America.
[01:24:56.189 --> 01:24:59.350]  Pundits will then say, how dare you say America runs the commies?
[01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:02.811]  Criminal megabanks run the commies.
[01:25:03.111 --> 01:25:10.694]  Read Tragedy and Hope, written by Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor, who he cried in a speech and thanked as the man that taught him everything.
[01:25:11.314 --> 01:25:12.635]  His CIA handler.
[01:25:13.868 --> 01:25:18.271]  When he was in the CIA and sent over to England with Hillary, who has been CIA from the beginning.
[01:25:19.912 --> 01:25:21.253]  By the way, that's documented.
[01:25:21.553 --> 01:25:24.815]  It's just the general public... Did you know Anderson Cooper's a Middle East CIA?
[01:25:26.256 --> 01:25:27.196]  And what is he, an aster?
[01:25:28.477 --> 01:25:31.319]  You know, the point is, it's the same Vanderbilt.
[01:25:31.799 --> 01:25:33.240]  Yeah, the other one's an aster.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.641]  The Daily Caller guy.
[01:25:35.141 --> 01:25:40.885]  The point is, is that there's never an end to any of this.
[01:25:43.982 --> 01:25:44.322]  All right?
[01:25:44.443 --> 01:25:50.068]  And a bunch of rich people want to sit the giant dumbed-down mask on the middle class.
[01:25:50.889 --> 01:25:54.192]  So, they plan a massive takeover in this country.
[01:25:55.153 --> 01:26:00.138]  Now, the solution to beat these people is in their defense strategy.
[01:26:01.758 --> 01:26:03.000]  What are they organized around?
[01:26:03.301 --> 01:26:10.133]  They're organized in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act before Obama got in for state insurrection even by legislatures.
[01:26:10.273 --> 01:26:13.659]  It talks about legislatures and governors and state insurrection.
[01:26:15.776 --> 01:26:17.658]  We're talking Civil War stuff.
[01:26:18.358 --> 01:26:20.540]  You notice they build Obama as he'll be the Lincoln.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.421]  They knew people were going to resist this.
[01:26:23.122 --> 01:26:24.683]  He'll crush the states.
[01:26:24.723 --> 01:26:26.664]  If you don't like turning your guns in, you're a racist.
[01:26:27.064 --> 01:26:28.065]  You're the Confederates.
[01:26:28.485 --> 01:26:29.506]  You're like, what's it have to do with that?
[01:26:30.147 --> 01:26:31.808]  If you don't like socialism, you're a Confederate.
[01:26:31.828 --> 01:26:33.869]  You're a white southerner, Rangel says.
[01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:35.931]  Al Sharpton says.
[01:26:37.478 --> 01:26:42.066]  All the MSNBC pundits, Rachel Maddow, Slimeball, Matthews, all of them.
[01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:43.489]  You're like, doesn't make sense.
[01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:44.711]  No, it does!
[01:26:45.493 --> 01:26:48.498]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and say the New Confederates did it.
[01:26:49.139 --> 01:26:50.281]  How did I know all this was coming?
[01:26:51.075 --> 01:26:53.877]  I was seeing Army War College stuff five years ago before Obama.
[01:26:54.158 --> 01:26:55.058]  They were getting ready, though.
[01:26:55.339 --> 01:26:58.161]  They were putting these out to the troops and putting them out to the officer corps.
[01:26:58.701 --> 01:27:00.803]  So, I see them getting the next war ready.
[01:27:01.303 --> 01:27:02.604]  And they do synthetic wars.
[01:27:02.645 --> 01:27:03.505]  They make them up.
[01:27:03.765 --> 01:27:04.866]  They run all the sides.
[01:27:05.107 --> 01:27:07.068]  So I see them getting it all ready.
[01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:09.770]  And I'm like, hey, the plan is they're going to say he's Lincoln.
[01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:11.412]  They're going to start a civil war.
[01:27:12.573 --> 01:27:18.938]  And so the entire program is set up, though, to where they'll artificially represent the states and call it Confederate.
[01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:25.172]  When the states of the Declaration of Independence and the people can reconstitute the government whenever they want.
[01:27:26.053 --> 01:27:29.074]  They want to billet federal government against the states and the evil whites.
[01:27:29.755 --> 01:27:32.896]  That's the new targets, the bullet training, the manuals.
[01:27:33.136 --> 01:27:34.177]  They want a false billet.
[01:27:34.837 --> 01:27:38.739]  It's us, minorities and a loving socialist government against the evil white right-wingers.
[01:27:38.959 --> 01:27:40.600]  Kill anybody in a John Deere hat!
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.501]  Let's get them!
[01:27:41.521 --> 01:27:42.261]  Yeah!
[01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:43.141]  Okay?
[01:27:43.502 --> 01:27:49.585]  Now, they want to push that false idea instead of people like Sheriff
[01:27:50.976 --> 01:28:04.702]  Clark, who's black, and super smart and well-spoken, has a hero background, along with 400 other sheriffs now, saying this is gonna cause a revolution, we're gonna be with the people, that totally freaks the system out.
[01:28:04.722 --> 01:28:08.844]  In fact, if I was the globalist, this is the type of person I'd go after, is Clark.
[01:28:09.905 --> 01:28:18.869]  And other sheriffs, like Mack, but the fact that he's black, and talks like George Washington, absolutely is like kryptonite to these people.
[01:28:20.663 --> 01:28:20.983]  All right.
[01:28:21.003 --> 01:28:22.885]  Of course, that's an analogy of a good guy.
[01:28:23.225 --> 01:28:27.548]  What's something that takes out water to the witch in The Wizard of Oz, okay?
[01:28:27.868 --> 01:28:28.969]  He's like water to the witch.
[01:28:29.069 --> 01:28:30.530]  I'm melting, I'm melting.
[01:28:30.991 --> 01:28:33.553]  So they want to have this balkanization, have this division.
[01:28:33.773 --> 01:28:35.014]  That's why it's so cartoonish.
[01:28:35.254 --> 01:28:42.620]  You turn on any drama or show, yeah, the whites are murdering killers and all veterans that are white are terrorists and McGarrett's going to take out the evil white person.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:43.721]  Next show.
[01:28:44.061 --> 01:28:45.782]  Yeah, crazy terrorist just blew stuff up.
[01:28:45.822 --> 01:28:47.003]  He thinks they're spraying stuff on us.
[01:28:47.304 --> 01:28:47.744]  Next show.
[01:28:47.904 --> 01:28:50.847]  Yeah, the founding fathers were killers and racist filth had to be dealt with.
[01:28:51.067 --> 01:28:51.527]  Next channel.
[01:28:51.847 --> 01:28:55.350]  Yeah, those who don't like socialism are actually enemies and planning to hurt children.
[01:28:55.651 --> 01:28:56.111]  Next channel.
[01:28:56.371 --> 01:28:57.772]  Yeah, the mother didn't take vaccines.
[01:28:57.792 --> 01:28:59.094]  We took her kids for abuse.
[01:28:59.614 --> 01:29:00.795]  It's abuse to not take shots.
[01:29:01.295 --> 01:29:01.836]  Next channel.
[01:29:02.276 --> 01:29:03.738]  Oh, fluoride's good for your children.
[01:29:03.778 --> 01:29:04.458]  Everyone knows it.
[01:29:04.498 --> 01:29:05.319]  So is aspartame.
[01:29:05.659 --> 01:29:07.841]  Only extremists that are child molesters are against it.
[01:29:08.201 --> 01:29:08.722]  Next channel.
[01:29:11.553 --> 01:29:13.715]  Oh, the lights are off because the rebels blew the power plant up.
[01:29:13.775 --> 01:29:15.096]  Uh-huh.
[01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:17.718]  See, if you're awake, it's cartoonish.
[01:29:18.339 --> 01:29:20.280]  But see, the general public watches that.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.261]  They go to work.
[01:29:21.381 --> 01:29:21.922]  They go home.
[01:29:21.962 --> 01:29:22.722]  They watch TV.
[01:29:22.962 --> 01:29:23.803]  That's their matrix.
[01:29:23.843 --> 01:29:24.524]  That's their bubble.
[01:29:24.884 --> 01:29:26.846]  So when I come back, I'm going to tell you how to beat these people.
[01:29:27.386 --> 01:29:27.466]  Okay?
[01:29:27.486 --> 01:29:28.327]  I'm going to tell you how to beat them.
[01:29:28.587 --> 01:29:31.750]  Because in their defense strategy, you see where they're weak.
[01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:33.191]  You understand?
[01:29:33.211 --> 01:29:35.132]  You understand?
[01:29:35.152 --> 01:29:39.176]  And I'm going to tell you, you beat them at one level,
[01:29:40.182 --> 01:29:41.123]  I'll just tell you when we come back.
[01:29:41.644 --> 01:29:49.635]  I mean, the thing is, if you knew what I knew, which isn't hard to know, if you understood my mind and understood the history, we could defeat them very quickly.
[01:29:50.396 --> 01:29:51.277]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.777 --> 01:29:53.379]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.321 --> 01:29:56.984]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.545 --> 01:30:08.408]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[01:30:08.568 --> 01:30:13.031]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[01:30:13.211 --> 01:30:23.696]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[01:30:23.996 --> 01:30:37.571]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers, using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:39.673]  I think so.
[01:31:05.091 --> 01:31:06.011]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:06.351 --> 01:31:09.912]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:10.213 --> 01:31:12.513]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.673 --> 01:31:17.955]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:18.375 --> 01:31:24.657]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:25.037 --> 01:31:30.599]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:34.680]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:39.182]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:39.482 --> 01:31:45.405]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:45.425 --> 01:31:48.406]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.986 --> 01:31:50.407]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.947 --> 01:31:51.467]  It's here.

[01:32:00.652 --> 01:32:02.293]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:32:02.553 --> 01:32:06.055]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:32:06.195 --> 01:32:10.597]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:32:10.737 --> 01:32:16.720]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:27.625]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:32:27.825 --> 01:32:34.131]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:32:34.331 --> 01:32:49.066]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[01:32:49.286 --> 01:32:50.307]  Big Brother.
[01:32:50.367 --> 01:32:51.048]  Mainstream media.
[01:32:51.068 --> 01:32:52.088]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:15.551]  You want answers?
[01:33:16.552 --> 01:33:18.392]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:18.472 --> 01:33:24.035]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.055 --> 01:33:24.155]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:24.175 --> 01:33:25.555]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:33:25.635 --> 01:33:27.796]  I want to kind of get out of brainstorm mode here.
[01:33:39.093 --> 01:33:40.674]  And try to just nail this down calmly.
[01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:42.536]  And a lot of it I've already said before.
[01:33:43.337 --> 01:33:48.061]  But we can defeat the globalists if we know who they are and how bad they are.
[01:33:48.581 --> 01:33:53.405]  And really get people out of their trance to realize that they can't be spectators any longer.
[01:33:54.826 --> 01:34:02.072]  And as this system gets more and more abusive, even decadent slobs will start to wake up and try to do something.
[01:34:04.334 --> 01:34:07.257]  But the biggest issue here is teaching people they do have power.
[01:34:08.803 --> 01:34:11.805]  Doing little things against the system.
[01:34:12.365 --> 01:34:14.386]  Telling people about this radio broadcast.
[01:34:15.006 --> 01:34:17.888]  Telling people about books and films that expose the New World Order.
[01:34:18.308 --> 01:34:20.369]  Running for political office, even if you lose.
[01:34:20.909 --> 01:34:21.750]  Educating people.
[01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:23.250]  Where you spend your money.
[01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:24.211]  What you support.
[01:34:24.551 --> 01:34:25.512]  Growing a garden.
[01:34:25.672 --> 01:34:26.512]  Buying local.
[01:34:27.433 --> 01:34:28.193]  Getting healthy.
[01:34:28.333 --> 01:34:29.714]  And none of us are perfect.
[01:34:29.774 --> 01:34:31.735]  It's just moving in the right direction.
[01:34:31.795 --> 01:34:33.195]  Big things have small beginnings.
[01:34:34.916 --> 01:34:35.837]  Now, that said,
[01:34:37.443 --> 01:34:38.423]  How do we defeat this?
[01:34:38.463 --> 01:34:41.165]  Well, first off, we see the globalists want to divide and conquer everybody.
[01:34:42.365 --> 01:34:46.807]  And we see they want to get rid of borders and bring in globalism to replace our republic.
[01:34:47.267 --> 01:34:50.368]  So basically, anything the globalists are for, we need to be against.
[01:34:50.808 --> 01:34:54.490]  If they're for taking guns, there are intellectual arguments for guns, obviously.
[01:34:55.130 --> 01:35:02.253]  But we just know to be against gun control because the globalists are tyrants and want to take our guns to enslave us.
[01:35:02.713 --> 01:35:04.474]  So I don't debate or argue with them.
[01:35:05.054 --> 01:35:06.034]  That's why I didn't debate.
[01:35:06.474 --> 01:35:07.635]  In fact, I debated too much.
[01:35:07.675 --> 01:35:11.116]  I should have debated even less with Piers Morgan, because he's not there to debate.
[01:35:11.416 --> 01:35:12.276]  He's a hatchet man.
[01:35:12.976 --> 01:35:18.378]  He's there to try to sell the disarmament and enslavement of our people, no matter what color they are.
[01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:28.101]  And we've got to come together for the real Bill of Rights and Constitution, the real civil rights, the real God-given rights, the real human rights of liberty and freedom.
[01:35:29.218 --> 01:35:40.046]  Not the right of a woman, or the right of being black, or the right of being Hispanic, or the right of being an evil white person, which they see as the main middle class that's left, to be taken down.
[01:35:40.066 --> 01:35:45.911]  And we've got to discredit the system, like our lives depend on it, because it does.
[01:35:46.691 --> 01:35:47.872]  It does depend on it.
[01:35:48.813 --> 01:35:49.614]  Now, that said,
[01:35:51.454 --> 01:36:14.443]  The way to defeat the Globalist is a rediscovery of the Declaration of Independence, that it is our right and our duty to throw off oppressive bonds, and that we are the sovereigns, and that we are the officials, and that we are the authority, and that the government people are our servants, and that corporations buying off government to just raise taxes arbitrarily, or fines or fees, or shut down power plants, that that's illegal.
[01:36:15.183 --> 01:36:19.925]  That the establishment can't just sell off utilities for pennies on the dollar to their friends.
[01:36:20.125 --> 01:36:22.226]  That's not privatization, that's piracy.
[01:36:23.187 --> 01:36:27.008]  But all that aside, this is the gist of it, the key.
[01:36:28.589 --> 01:36:36.192]  In their defeat, finding the way to defeat them is to look where they're most defensive.
[01:36:37.093 --> 01:36:38.653]  Because where is the rightful remedy?
[01:36:38.873 --> 01:36:41.755]  States' rights, Tenth Amendment nullification,
[01:36:42.941 --> 01:36:45.487]  Bringing the Congress and the federal government under control.
[01:36:45.788 --> 01:36:48.495]  But you're only going to do that when you realize it's fully captured.
[01:36:48.996 --> 01:36:50.159]  It doesn't listen to reason.
[01:36:51.514 --> 01:36:53.536]  It doesn't find the truth.
[01:36:53.596 --> 01:36:54.676]  It doesn't get religion.
[01:36:54.697 --> 01:36:55.817]  It doesn't come to Jesus.
[01:36:56.198 --> 01:37:00.601]  Because it's a fully held pillbox full of foreign soldiers.
[01:37:01.342 --> 01:37:02.863]  Full of global technocrats.
[01:37:03.163 --> 01:37:05.124]  We're designed to fight a foreign enemy in a uniform.
[01:37:05.445 --> 01:37:10.028]  These are bought off agents of globalists who are totally ruthless.
[01:37:10.869 --> 01:37:15.712]  And whose tool of control is to make you poor while consolidating and stealing your wealth.
[01:37:17.334 --> 01:37:18.795]  So we as a people
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:23.582]  First we have to realize that, and then we have to realize what are they worried about?
[01:37:24.123 --> 01:37:33.109]  States' rights, the family, the individual, races of people coming together around the Bill of Rights and Constitution as a human race for liberty.
[01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:36.112]  They're afraid of being independent.
[01:37:36.132 --> 01:37:37.573]  They're afraid of private wealth.
[01:37:38.013 --> 01:37:42.396]  They're afraid of freedom because they're flaming authoritarians.
[01:37:46.044 --> 01:37:50.826]  So once you realize that, you look at how they're set up saying states have no rights ever.
[01:37:51.126 --> 01:37:52.086]  Well, why do we have states?
[01:37:52.506 --> 01:37:53.286]  We know that's a fraud.
[01:37:53.847 --> 01:37:58.228]  How in 1913 they took the senators from the states who were elected by the legislature.
[01:37:58.528 --> 01:38:03.090]  Senators were pure creatures of the state, giving the states the veto power over government.
[01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:05.330]  That's the real system.
[01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:06.871]  Separation of powers.
[01:38:08.151 --> 01:38:10.152]  And so we move for states' rights.
[01:38:11.351 --> 01:38:15.776]  We move for sovereignty of America and expose the fact that we're under globalism.
[01:38:16.096 --> 01:38:20.300]  We expose the fact the federal government's been captured and those serving them are collaborators.
[01:38:20.541 --> 01:38:21.882]  That's not rhetoric, folks.
[01:38:22.182 --> 01:38:24.705]  Like I'm saying, it's like they're foreign collaborators.
[01:38:24.925 --> 01:38:25.606]  They are.
[01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:27.668]  Get that through your head.
[01:38:28.028 --> 01:38:29.470]  Get that out to everyone, okay?
[01:38:31.212 --> 01:38:46.939]  And then we realize that's why they demonize states' rights, that's why they demonize gun owners, that's why they demonize, because they've got things planned so horrible, they know people are going to get out of their coma and finally physically resist, and the government and the foreign bankers know they have no other choice.
[01:38:47.219 --> 01:38:53.902]  They're all going to go to jail unless they bring in a total tyranny and arrest their opposition, those of us aware of their criminal takeover.
[01:38:54.302 --> 01:38:56.943]  So see, they're committed, 100% to their cause.
[01:38:59.574 --> 01:39:11.836]  But if you really look at it, strategically, militarily, culturally, historically, it's so over the top to have a foreign occupier, and foreign occupiers always get run out if the people have the will to fight.
[01:39:12.096 --> 01:39:16.617]  So why don't we politically fight and culturally fight ahead of a physical fight?
[01:39:16.817 --> 01:39:24.959]  Because even though there's a good chance they'll lose that, that's what they want to go to, because they can see long-term they're losing the hearts and minds of the people.
[01:39:27.679 --> 01:39:41.412]  So their entire defense structure is around stopping the rightful remedy in the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, of state sovereignty, individual sovereignty, Bill of Rights, Constitution, that's duplicated in the 50 states.
[01:39:42.653 --> 01:39:50.380]  In case the head gets taken over, there are 50 other systems that can join together or separately lead the way out of the takeover.
[01:39:50.781 --> 01:39:51.742]  It's designed
[01:39:54.369 --> 01:40:01.658]  Like ships that have their own air tanks in them so if they're flooding they just pump up the air tanks.
[01:40:01.918 --> 01:40:04.621]  Or boats that can't be sunk that have styrofoam in them.
[01:40:04.921 --> 01:40:08.986]  But the globalists are in there like termites trying to eat out the styrofoam to sink us.
[01:40:09.006 --> 01:40:09.627]  You understand that?
[01:40:09.807 --> 01:40:11.509]  Well we just need to bail.
[01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:27.147]  When you resist the globalists, when you criticize the UN, when you fight for sovereignty, when you go and get involved politically, when you speak out, look at Obama trying to rally all his idiot minions to go after guns and saying, I need your horrible stories of what happened to you to personalize it.
[01:40:27.487 --> 01:40:31.572]  One man's a tragedy, a million's a statistic, as Stalin said.
[01:40:32.998 --> 01:40:34.159]  Because it's a culture war.
[01:40:34.679 --> 01:40:41.884]  And he's trying to rally the useful idiots he's sucking dry and abusing and destroying and all the poor he's creating.
[01:40:42.285 --> 01:40:43.245]  Because he's their front man.
[01:40:45.087 --> 01:40:47.768]  We need to rally everybody.
[01:40:47.828 --> 01:40:49.990]  You need to realize how important you are in this fight.
[01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:50.811]  But here's the key.
[01:40:51.251 --> 01:40:52.132]  I always build up to it.
[01:40:53.032 --> 01:40:55.954]  Because there's hundreds of little points I want to make, but the big central one is this.
[01:40:56.234 --> 01:41:02.039]  State sovereignty, a second American Revolution, because that's a catching term and that's what it is,
[01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:11.903]  But not a Soviet cultural revolution, not a fascist cultural revolution, an American Republic, born-again revolution of mind.
[01:41:12.164 --> 01:41:13.425]  That's where it all starts first.
[01:41:13.445 --> 01:41:14.966]  90% of war is info war.
[01:41:15.866 --> 01:41:27.395]  And we take that revolution of mind and we inject that revolution out there with the pride and the dignity and the focus that we have knowing we're in the right.
[01:41:27.875 --> 01:41:31.858]  And not caring if we're criticized, not caring if people are brainwashed and laugh at us.
[01:41:31.878 --> 01:41:32.459]  They're victims.
[01:41:33.886 --> 01:41:47.234]  And we explained that the system is demonizing states' rights, gun owners, constitutionalists, and trying to typecast it as WWE star Jack Swagger in a staged arrest demonizing Alex Jones.
[01:41:49.916 --> 01:41:54.659]  They're doing all of that because they know that is the way out of all of this.
[01:41:55.956 --> 01:42:04.198]  And so they want to make Hispanics, blacks, northern whites, whoever, think, well, you're not part of America, even though it started in the North.
[01:42:04.678 --> 01:42:07.558]  You're not part of 1776, even though you live in Boston or New York.
[01:42:08.238 --> 01:42:09.179]  You don't know your history.
[01:42:09.219 --> 01:42:10.259]  You're not taught your history.
[01:42:10.559 --> 01:42:11.919]  Oh, no, it's those evil Southerners.
[01:42:11.939 --> 01:42:13.760]  They want to keep the guns because they're racist.
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:21.721]  The big delicious punch bowl of the Republic that everybody would want to drink out of.
[01:42:21.801 --> 01:42:24.802]  And what's Chris Matthews and Al Sharpton doing?
[01:42:24.862 --> 01:42:25.222]  They are
[01:42:26.345 --> 01:42:32.818]  Bent over, using the restroom, in the punchbowl, so that people won't go drink out of it.
[01:42:32.838 --> 01:42:34.201]  But that's not the real punchbowl!
[01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:35.902]  You understand that?
[01:42:36.202 --> 01:42:41.664]  And so we just simply have to point out they're desperately demonizing things because that's where they're weak.
[01:42:42.044 --> 01:42:43.325]  That's where they can be defeated.
[01:42:43.365 --> 01:42:44.305]  That they're occupiers.
[01:42:44.505 --> 01:42:45.326]  That they're liars.
[01:42:45.566 --> 01:42:46.406]  That they're frauds.
[01:42:46.606 --> 01:42:48.187]  That they have tiny audiences now.
[01:42:48.547 --> 01:42:49.407]  They're imploding!
[01:42:49.607 --> 01:42:52.008]  That's why they claim Obama was a mandate.
[01:42:52.228 --> 01:42:53.349]  Obama has won.
[01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:54.869]  Everyone wants socialism.
[01:42:55.089 --> 01:42:56.170]  And to turn their guns in.
[01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:58.551]  And they have open borders.
[01:42:58.571 --> 01:43:10.156]  And they have the Crossroads Group, and hundreds of millions of Republican dollars, and Karl Rove leading it, demonizing even mainline conservatives like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh.
[01:43:14.177 --> 01:43:20.420]  Because they saw all those Tea Party people get elected, and all those Campaign for Liberty people get elected, a whole bunch.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.081]  So Karl Rove comes out and says, you got no one elected!
[01:43:23.362 --> 01:43:24.182]  I got two people!
[01:43:27.597 --> 01:43:29.378]  And they announced it's a mandate with Obama.
[01:43:29.438 --> 01:43:29.859]  Obama!
[01:43:29.919 --> 01:43:30.219]  Obama!
[01:43:30.559 --> 01:43:32.760]  It's all a hoax because they've got a 9% approval rating.
[01:43:32.961 --> 01:43:33.681]  They're imploding.
[01:43:33.701 --> 01:43:34.322]  They're in trouble.
[01:43:34.362 --> 01:43:35.162]  They're falling apart.
[01:43:35.402 --> 01:43:41.626]  So they've got the WWE Republican run with the big Republican moguls of Jim McMahon and his wife.
[01:43:42.407 --> 01:43:47.310]  And you've got Fox News up there making jokes about it and acting like they're against it but actually pushing it.
[01:43:47.610 --> 01:43:51.253]  And you've got shows on Fox TV demonizing constitutionalists.
[01:43:51.513 --> 01:43:51.753]  See?
[01:43:51.953 --> 01:43:52.554]  Rupert Murdoch.
[01:43:53.314 --> 01:43:57.576]  All of this trying, because the same globalists own the Republicans and the Democrats.
[01:43:58.076 --> 01:44:16.862]  And they're scared of a real revolution in the most likely candidate, the Republican Party, to get friends in Congress to give moral support to constitutional conservatives and libertarians in the states, to get together with a real movement to take over the Republican Party and take America back.
[01:44:17.242 --> 01:44:22.464]  That's why they had to put Romney in, one of their establishment types, to kill it, to make sure it failed.
[01:44:24.594 --> 01:44:26.135]  So that they could claim the mandate.
[01:44:26.155 --> 01:44:27.355]  It was rigged at every level.
[01:44:27.395 --> 01:44:28.156]  The fix was in.
[01:44:30.277 --> 01:44:35.619]  And they're going for broke right now, not because they're strong, but because they're 7 to 10 years behind.
[01:44:35.679 --> 01:44:39.001]  Even Brzezinski says that, one of their top tacticians.
[01:44:40.421 --> 01:44:43.283]  And they know if they don't get it all done now, it's over.
[01:44:43.763 --> 01:44:45.464]  So that's why you're going to
[01:44:48.664 --> 01:44:51.386]  See Fox News trying to pacify conservatives.
[01:44:52.127 --> 01:45:01.455]  Because, and they say on there, we don't want Alex Jones, we don't want Alex Jones to radicalize conservatives.
[01:45:01.535 --> 01:45:05.018]  And oh, Alex Jones doesn't speak for conservatives, you bet.
[01:45:05.398 --> 01:45:10.663]  I don't speak, I don't speak for New World Order fake Republicans.
[01:45:11.123 --> 01:45:13.706]  And see, Glenn Beck, who's a chameleon, he knows this.
[01:45:14.673 --> 01:45:25.175]  Back when Ron Paul had a chance to win four years ago in the primaries, he shot him down, said his supporters want to blow stuff up, the army needs to be used against him, I'm for the banker bailout, you know, the Bilderberg Group's not bad.
[01:45:25.435 --> 01:45:30.396]  Now he's like, I'm a libertarian, and I don't like the Republicans, and I'm leaving their party.
[01:45:31.077 --> 01:45:41.859]  And Karl Rove is taking it over and trying to kill the Tea Party, which is all true, except, okay, you've got New World Order Karl Rove, probably listening right now, lives in Austin, you've got him up here,
[01:45:43.683 --> 01:45:46.146]  Total New World Order, because they work for the foreign banks.
[01:45:46.766 --> 01:45:49.469]  They gotta give you a fake choice of Obama or mainline Republicans.
[01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:56.496]  And then you've got Glenn Beck, you know, next, who's there, who just wants the market of the libertarian conservatives.
[01:45:58.057 --> 01:46:01.000]  And he's doing a lot more good than mainline Republicans, so I'm not bashing him.
[01:46:01.861 --> 01:46:03.263]  It's just that I don't trust him.
[01:46:04.449 --> 01:46:06.130]  I mean, these guys are all shifty-eyed beyond belief.
[01:46:06.150 --> 01:46:06.771]  They're not real.
[01:46:07.211 --> 01:46:09.532]  They're all about how they're winners and they figured out the angles.
[01:46:09.813 --> 01:46:12.795]  Figuring out the angles isn't how you win, folks, in a desperate situation.
[01:46:13.155 --> 01:46:14.356]  You go past the angles.
[01:46:14.596 --> 01:46:15.776]  You redefine the game.
[01:46:15.977 --> 01:46:16.957]  That's how we're going to beat this.
[01:46:16.997 --> 01:46:17.798]  It's our only shot.
[01:46:17.998 --> 01:46:18.878]  And it's a big shot.
[01:46:20.459 --> 01:46:25.683]  We've got a really good chance of beating this thing if you realize, folks, you're not signing on to some global corporate takeover.
[01:46:25.903 --> 01:46:31.947]  You're signing on to something that makes Hitler look like a uncoordinated schoolboy.
[01:46:34.059 --> 01:46:38.303]  I mean, you're talking Incredible Hulk versus a electroshock therapy Hitler.
[01:46:39.224 --> 01:46:39.544]  Okay?
[01:46:40.685 --> 01:46:41.646]  A lobotomized Hitler.
[01:46:43.148 --> 01:46:54.299]  I mean, this is a mean machine, but it only can convert and take over if you're not aware, if you're not involved, and if you don't realize how over-the-top cuckoo this eugenics takeover is.
[01:46:55.748 --> 01:46:57.090]  Okay, so we've got all that happening.
[01:46:57.931 --> 01:47:01.375]  So I'm calling again for the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:01.395 --> 01:47:02.817]  And you notice the media tried to spin it.
[01:47:03.057 --> 01:47:04.098]  He wants to take up arms.
[01:47:04.158 --> 01:47:04.839]  No, the opposite.
[01:47:05.119 --> 01:47:06.781]  I want to take up info weapons.
[01:47:07.122 --> 01:47:08.303]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:47:08.564 --> 01:47:09.124]  The keyboard.
[01:47:09.425 --> 01:47:10.065]  The bullhorn.
[01:47:10.366 --> 01:47:11.067]  The banner hang.
[01:47:11.107 --> 01:47:11.908]  The bumper sticker.
[01:47:12.048 --> 01:47:14.251]  Now, now, now, now, now.
[01:47:14.851 --> 01:47:15.092]  Now.
[01:47:16.482 --> 01:47:19.584]  And realize the unbelievable, holy mission you're on.
[01:47:20.204 --> 01:47:22.225]  I mean, you are literally in the footsteps.
[01:47:22.325 --> 01:47:24.626]  Our forebearers fought the greatest empire the world had ever seen.
[01:47:25.126 --> 01:47:25.807]  Never been beaten.
[01:47:26.267 --> 01:47:27.147]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:47:28.408 --> 01:47:31.429]  The British Redcoats were not that evil compared to what we face.
[01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.730]  They were powerful!
[01:47:36.801 --> 01:47:51.664]  But the reason our forebears committed to fighting something that had never been beaten, because it was horrible to be a slave, it was horrible to be humiliated, and they saw things getting worse, and they saw their lands being taken, and their kids being oppressed as slaves, white slaves.
[01:47:52.084 --> 01:47:53.205]  They just called it impressment.
[01:47:53.225 --> 01:47:54.265]  They didn't call it slavery.
[01:47:54.965 --> 01:48:00.906]  For a ten-year stint on ships, where the average person only lived about five years, he had a very low chance of living.
[01:48:01.626 --> 01:48:04.227]  They would go around town and grab men, women, and children, mainly
[01:48:05.319 --> 01:48:12.801]  Well, not really women, that was later, but the point is, they would grab women for other service, but they would grab boys and men, but boys mainly because they could be made to serve.
[01:48:13.181 --> 01:48:20.123]  For the hellish, hellish slave trade, you name it, that was going on on the east coast of Africa.
[01:48:20.963 --> 01:48:24.984]  The point is, I don't want to digress into history here, we don't have a choice.
[01:48:25.604 --> 01:48:32.046]  And hell, you can go get Jack Daniels and Prozac and go watch the football game and say, I don't care, devil take it, that's your business.
[01:48:33.971 --> 01:48:36.072]  But this is the animating contest for liberty.
[01:48:36.773 --> 01:48:37.874]  This is the real deal.
[01:48:38.414 --> 01:48:47.260]  And the entire globalist program is focused on demonizing the Tea Party, veterans, gut owners, constitutionalists, in the fetters.
[01:48:49.161 --> 01:48:49.602]  And why?
[01:48:49.662 --> 01:48:52.844]  Because we carry with us what made America great.
[01:48:53.144 --> 01:48:54.405]  We are the Americans.
[01:48:54.685 --> 01:48:55.846]  We are the informed.
[01:48:56.186 --> 01:48:58.968]  We are the people that are left.
[01:48:59.068 --> 01:48:59.969]  We're the real elite.
[01:49:00.785 --> 01:49:07.588]  We're the real remnant, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, German, Chinese, Jewish, Tasmanian.
[01:49:08.489 --> 01:49:10.169]  The point is, you're it.
[01:49:11.170 --> 01:49:16.232]  And if you're listening anywhere in the world, you're facing the same global corporate design program.
[01:49:16.592 --> 01:49:20.094]  Unified agenda, same textbook, same name, same deal.
[01:49:20.979 --> 01:49:21.599]  And you're it.
[01:49:21.739 --> 01:49:23.720]  We are humanity's best and only hope.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.381]  And God is behind us.
[01:49:25.401 --> 01:49:29.842]  But listen, you've got to take the first steps and say, God, I'm going to fight the corruption.
[01:49:29.862 --> 01:49:30.562]  I'm going to do the best.
[01:49:30.642 --> 01:49:31.403]  Show me what to do.
[01:49:31.943 --> 01:49:32.583]  Say that prayer.
[01:49:33.503 --> 01:49:48.689]  Whether you're a Christian, a Jewish, Muslim, an atheist, if you don't even believe in God and spiritualism or whatever you want to call it, asking the ether, asking the source,
[01:49:49.992 --> 01:49:50.833]  I want to be good.
[01:49:51.073 --> 01:49:52.293]  I want to fight corruption.
[01:49:53.074 --> 01:49:54.054]  I don't know what to do.
[01:49:55.235 --> 01:49:56.256]  Open up the doors for me.
[01:49:56.316 --> 01:49:57.136]  Show me what to do.
[01:49:57.236 --> 01:49:59.057]  The universe, the doors will just open.
[01:50:00.778 --> 01:50:11.625]  The universe, as Martin Luther King said, justice is there in the universe and the universe bends towards justice.
[01:50:11.665 --> 01:50:12.445]  The providence.
[01:50:12.845 --> 01:50:14.446]  You've got to ask for the providence.
[01:50:15.127 --> 01:50:16.628]  You've got to decide you want to be good.
[01:50:17.517 --> 01:50:19.002]  You've got to decide you want the truth.
[01:50:19.443 --> 01:50:20.947]  You've got to decide you want liberty.
[01:50:20.968 --> 01:50:23.856]  You've got to decide you don't want to be ruled by bad people.
[01:50:24.077 --> 01:50:25.180]  Because here's the thing about evil.
[01:50:28.684 --> 01:50:37.447]  Once you get bad guys in place, but who aren't completely sadistic and murderous, they'll be replaced by those that are worse, and those that are worse, and those that are worse.
[01:50:37.727 --> 01:50:41.068]  That's why you always get such crazy, wild men.
[01:50:41.088 --> 01:50:49.370]  You know, royalty bathing in children's blood, or burning down whole cities, or declaring themselves God, or demanding human sacrifices.
[01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:55.092]  Because megalomaniac psychopaths will always end up taking over a big government.
[01:50:55.572 --> 01:50:56.892]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:50:57.193 --> 01:51:00.013]  We need 1776 worldwide now.
[01:51:01.674 --> 01:51:02.974]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[01:51:03.214 --> 01:51:04.835]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[01:51:05.035 --> 01:51:07.116]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[01:51:07.376 --> 01:51:08.916]  What can you not live without?
[01:51:09.096 --> 01:51:10.537]  What is your greatest dependency?
[01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:11.517]  Is it your guns?
[01:51:11.797 --> 01:51:12.417]  Is it your home?
[01:51:12.737 --> 01:51:13.858]  No, it's food.
[01:51:14.158 --> 01:51:16.038]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:51:16.278 --> 01:51:19.559]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[01:51:19.779 --> 01:51:20.840]  Don't be dependent.
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:21.960]  Be self-sufficient.
[01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:23.681]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[01:51:23.761 --> 01:51:24.421]  Feed yourself.
[01:51:24.861 --> 01:51:26.962]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:51:27.102 --> 01:51:30.423]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.

[01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:05.133]  Hey, doll, can you scare up another round for our table over here and tell the cook this is low-grade dog food, all right?
[01:54:05.494 --> 01:54:07.815]  And here, take this for yourself, okay?
[01:54:07.935 --> 01:54:10.497]  Jeez, I had better food at the ball game, you know?
[01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:13.919]  I tell you, this steak still has marks where the jockey was hitting it.
[01:54:13.959 --> 01:54:16.500]  Dog food!
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:19.522]  I'll show you dog food!
[01:54:22.199 --> 01:54:22.939]  Hey, where's the bar?
[01:54:22.979 --> 01:54:25.760]  Let's have some drinks here and see what's going on for quite a while.
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:27.000]  Hey, wait a minute.
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:29.261]  This is for you, all right?
[01:54:29.381 --> 01:54:30.101]  Captain Hook?
[01:54:30.801 --> 01:54:32.281]  How about the grand you owe me, huh?
[01:54:32.401 --> 01:54:33.101]  Ah, forget about it.
[01:54:33.121 --> 01:54:34.202]  I'm just kidding, all right?
[01:54:34.322 --> 01:54:35.922]  Oh, this is your wife?
[01:54:36.022 --> 01:54:37.182]  Oh, a lovely lady.
[01:54:37.262 --> 01:54:38.463]  Hey, baby, you're all right.
[01:54:38.483 --> 01:54:40.603]  You must have been something before electricity, huh?
[01:54:40.643 --> 01:54:43.844]  Hey, doll, how are you?
[01:54:43.884 --> 01:54:44.544]  You live alone?
[01:54:45.784 --> 01:54:51.486]  And I thought we'd play that because I haven't talked much about the horse meat scandal that's so huge now.
[01:55:10.578 --> 01:55:13.564]  And now it ties into all this, but here's USA Today.
[01:55:14.146 --> 01:55:17.533]  Fish fraud is off the scale at restaurants nationwide.
[01:55:17.553 --> 01:55:21.240]  And you're paying top dollar for Snapper or Flounder or...
[01:55:23.496 --> 01:55:32.021]  Whatever the case could be, swordfish, and you're really getting tilapia that they've reformed and they've got all these ways to make it fake, kind of like the red slime, the pink slime.
[01:55:32.741 --> 01:55:39.706]  But, you know what, I know what all these big industries can do, the fish industry, the restaurant industry, Nestle and others caught with the horse meat.
[01:55:39.926 --> 01:55:41.206]  Just say it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:55:42.207 --> 01:55:43.168]  Hell, you could serve them...
[01:55:44.701 --> 01:55:47.323]  Well, the Japanese are actually coming out with this reconstituted feces.
[01:55:47.943 --> 01:55:50.485]  You guys pull up poop as meat.
[01:55:51.426 --> 01:55:54.468]  It's a Japanese TV, but you can show the viewers, radio listeners.
[01:55:55.068 --> 01:55:58.730]  I mean, hell, you could have... I'm not kidding.
[01:55:58.750 --> 01:56:00.632]  With the average American, you could have...
[01:56:01.863 --> 01:56:04.945]  You could put, like, a centipede on their plate and tell them it's beef.
[01:56:05.005 --> 01:56:12.628]  And if they say, that looks like a centipede, go, conspiracy theory, and then go, oh, OK, let me eat that, you know, large, red-headed Texas centipede.
[01:56:13.208 --> 01:56:15.029]  I say that because I caught one this morning.
[01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:16.470]  The kid's got a kick out of it.
[01:56:17.150 --> 01:56:19.972]  The point is, is that, yeah, there it is.
[01:56:20.672 --> 01:56:21.092]  Fade it up.
[01:56:21.132 --> 01:56:21.993]  Fade up the poop meat.
[01:56:22.033 --> 01:56:22.853]  People think I'm joking.
[01:56:23.153 --> 01:56:24.354]  Can we fade up the poop meat, please?
[01:56:24.374 --> 01:56:27.335]  I mean, you think I'm joking here, but you know what?
[01:56:27.595 --> 01:56:28.236]  It's not poop.
[01:56:28.296 --> 01:56:29.116]  It's a conspiracy.
[01:56:29.876 --> 01:56:30.757]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:56:32.611 --> 01:56:46.049]  And of course, and of course, Natural News has pointed out, how about bromine in not just Gatorade, but scores of other soft drinks that will give you cancer and infertility and also make you have mental illness?
[01:56:47.110 --> 01:56:47.290]  Hmm?
[01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.951]  How's that sound?
[01:56:48.956 --> 01:56:51.378]  Yeah, in Japan, they have the new meat product.
[01:56:51.498 --> 01:56:52.619]  As they say, it's quite delicious.
[01:56:52.999 --> 01:56:53.259]  Poop.
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:53.960]  Human poop.
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:54.601]  Here it is.
[01:56:55.101 --> 01:56:55.762]  Your TV viewer.
[01:56:55.802 --> 01:56:58.023]  I'm not kidding.
[01:56:58.684 --> 01:57:02.427]  Sewage mud contains a great deal of protein.
[01:57:02.507 --> 01:57:04.749]  We research whether we can extract the protein.
[01:57:05.609 --> 01:57:07.191]  And re-strikle it.
[01:57:07.591 --> 01:57:09.973]  The process creates delicious beef.
[01:57:10.353 --> 01:57:14.276]  Sewage mud is rich in protein because it is alive with bacteria.
[01:57:14.697 --> 01:57:18.660]  These bacteria are harmless because they are killed by heat during the manufacturing.
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:20.501]  Look at that poop meat.
[01:57:22.703 --> 01:57:25.605]  The red color is obtained by using food coloring.
[01:57:26.105 --> 01:57:30.408]  The artificial steak, according to initial tests, even tastes like beef.
[01:57:30.949 --> 01:57:31.089]  Oh!
[01:57:31.149 --> 01:57:34.051]  In fact, to refine the flavor... That's enough!
[01:57:35.632 --> 01:57:36.833]  He enjoys eating it himself.
[01:57:38.075 --> 01:57:39.376]  You think I'm joking about this stuff?
[01:57:39.756 --> 01:57:44.078]  Folks, they spray live viruses, poop viruses, on most meat you eat.
[01:57:44.518 --> 01:57:45.259]  They won't believe that.
[01:57:45.579 --> 01:57:48.500]  Type in viruses sprayed on meat.
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:50.221]  It's six years old, ABC News.
[01:57:50.621 --> 01:57:51.702]  They radiated everything.
[01:57:51.742 --> 01:57:53.263]  They sprayed poop viruses on it.
[01:57:53.623 --> 01:57:54.423]  Hope you enjoy it.
[01:57:55.124 --> 01:57:55.824]  It's good for you.
[01:57:55.844 --> 01:57:57.285]  You think I'm joking about poop viruses?
[01:57:57.945 --> 01:57:58.885]  Whatever.
[01:57:58.925 --> 01:58:05.769]  In Latin, it translates to poop-eating viruses, or viruses that eat poop-eating bacteria, I guess is the full quote.
[01:58:07.481 --> 01:58:09.962]  I'll tell you, having knowledge is the beginning of sorrow.
[01:58:10.022 --> 01:58:11.222]  I think it says somewhere in the Bible.
[01:58:11.962 --> 01:58:14.143]  The bottom line is they're afraid of states' rights movements.
[01:58:14.363 --> 01:58:15.583]  They're telling you you have no power.
[01:58:15.603 --> 01:58:20.845]  They're telling you the Tea Party's dead, the Republican and Democratic parties, because it's the stake that can go to the vampire's heart.
[01:58:21.085 --> 01:58:22.645]  It's the high noon to Count Shocula.
[01:58:23.125 --> 01:58:23.466]  Okay?
[01:58:23.746 --> 01:58:24.706]  It is the holy water.
[01:58:26.869 --> 01:58:36.038]  To that Renfield-like creature known as Janet Napolitano that walks around dragging her knuckles on the ground like some type of albino possum re-engineered with a chimpanzee.

[02:00:05.666 --> 02:00:06.306]  Big Brother.

[02:00:10.487 --> 02:00:11.287]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.068 --> 02:00:12.968]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:17.809 --> 02:00:21.910]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:26.992]  I have decided to become a trendy for at least the next five minutes.
[02:00:27.012 --> 02:00:30.473]  I want to say there is no horse meat being fed to anyone that they claim is beef.
[02:00:30.713 --> 02:00:31.753]  That is a conspiracy.
[02:00:32.694 --> 02:00:34.396]  There are no drones operating domestically.
[02:00:34.496 --> 02:00:36.018]  The NSA is not listening to us.
[02:00:36.358 --> 02:00:38.540]  There is no world government, even though it's all been announced.
[02:00:40.222 --> 02:00:41.203]  And everything's fine.
[02:00:41.223 --> 02:00:42.965]  And USA Today is lying.
[02:00:43.366 --> 02:00:46.469]  No restaurants serve you a lower quality fish and mislabel it.
[02:00:46.809 --> 02:00:48.111]  There is no lying.
[02:00:48.511 --> 02:00:50.033]  No one should question anything.
[02:00:50.473 --> 02:00:51.515]  Everything's fine.
[02:00:51.555 --> 02:00:52.536]  The government loves you.
[02:00:53.116 --> 02:00:53.297]  There.
[02:00:54.167 --> 02:00:54.367]  There.
[02:00:54.788 --> 02:00:55.668]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:00:55.708 --> 02:00:57.950]  A bunch of your calls, and I'm going to get into the main news.
[02:00:58.371 --> 02:01:02.274]  I've covered some of it, but the economy and a lot more coming up right now.
[02:01:02.915 --> 02:01:04.636]  Let's talk to Jeremy in Texas.
[02:01:04.656 --> 02:01:07.279]  Jeremy, thank you for patiently holding her on the air, sir.
[02:01:08.527 --> 02:01:09.007]  Thank you, sir.
[02:01:09.067 --> 02:01:10.068]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:01:10.348 --> 02:01:16.391]  I was calling in because you'd asked for what we think some solutions can be and I think... Hold on a minute.
[02:01:16.411 --> 02:01:17.631]  We've got to have the record skipping.
[02:01:17.651 --> 02:01:19.612]  You actually called in on what I asked you to call in about?
[02:01:19.932 --> 02:01:20.653]  This may be a first.
[02:01:20.693 --> 02:01:21.093]  Go ahead.
[02:01:22.413 --> 02:01:25.015]  Well, my story was a few years ago.
[02:01:25.595 --> 02:01:29.317]  I'm going into my third year now as a Prison Planet TV member.
[02:01:29.397 --> 02:01:34.439]  Three years ago, I was what you would call an evangelical Christian at Hagee's Church here in San Antonio.
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:47.579]  Uh, was a leader in the church, uh, taught Bible study, taught marriage intimacy, uh, and was a big believer in the, the pre-trib, uh, uh, rapture until I, I had been listening to you a little bit.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:02:02.731]  Didn't really... I wouldn't say I didn't believe you, but I just found it interesting until you had brought up about how, you know, we were going to live through the Tribulation, and then the Rapture was going to happen after that, that the Rockefeller Foundation had started introducing that in the 1800s.
[02:02:03.212 --> 02:02:10.998]  Well, I'm one of the people that still actually research stuff, and when I researched it, I went back and I found out that what you said was absolutely true.
[02:02:11.038 --> 02:02:12.479]  There's nothing in history
[02:02:13.303 --> 02:02:25.207]  Except for, I think, some Roman priest that mentioned it a thousand years ago just as a paper, but before then... Well, yeah, I mean, the Gnostics thought that a little bit, but it wasn't the same thing, yeah.
[02:02:25.927 --> 02:02:30.788]  Yeah, but it wasn't until then that I really believed you.
[02:02:31.108 --> 02:02:32.329]  And, I mean, you are 100% responsible
[02:02:34.178 --> 02:02:35.779]  for bringing me out of the matrix.
[02:02:36.039 --> 02:02:37.179]  I am an evangelical.
[02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:38.420]  I am a Christian.
[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:43.563]  And then, of course, now with Pastor Anderson's movie that came out, which I think is absolutely amazing.
[02:02:44.203 --> 02:02:48.185]  But, you know, being in the church that I was in here, I don't go there anymore.
[02:02:48.205 --> 02:02:50.746]  I mean, I was a lemming.
[02:02:50.786 --> 02:02:51.707]  I was a neocon.
[02:02:51.747 --> 02:02:57.850]  I was exactly... What happened when you started telling people, hey, the beast will wage war against the states and overcome them?
[02:02:57.870 --> 02:02:59.330]  I mean, what did they say to you?
[02:02:59.350 --> 02:03:00.451]  I mean, did you try to wake them up?
[02:03:01.508 --> 02:03:02.288]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:03:02.328 --> 02:03:03.668]  I've been doing that for three years.
[02:03:04.549 --> 02:03:09.650]  I had, you know, 50 or 60 friends that went to that church on Facebook that are no longer my friends.
[02:03:11.070 --> 02:03:12.850]  You know, they defriended me.
[02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:20.071]  Again, so afraid that you don't agree with them because, oh, there's nothing bad that's going to happen to us.
[02:03:20.111 --> 02:03:22.392]  Did any of the Christians ever get teleported out?
[02:03:22.792 --> 02:03:28.193]  Well, sometimes they did, like the Lion's Den or the Fiery Furnace, but they had to go into it first.
[02:03:29.198 --> 02:03:29.878]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:03:29.918 --> 02:03:31.539]  And Noah didn't get taken off the earth.
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:32.340]  He stayed.
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.143]  So, I mean, the history of the Bible shows that every time they went through tribulation, God never took them out of it.
[02:03:37.163 --> 02:03:38.123]  They had to stay through it.
[02:03:39.124 --> 02:03:41.505]  Did they get raptured out with the lions?
[02:03:41.765 --> 02:03:44.347]  Or a lot of Christians thought they were going to be raptured in Nazi Germany.
[02:03:44.387 --> 02:03:44.907]  Did that happen?
[02:03:45.788 --> 02:03:46.708]  No, absolutely not.
[02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:54.453]  But what I'm saying about them is they are... I was in that church for seven or eight years and they brought in
[02:03:55.054 --> 02:03:59.239]  Historians and people that talked about the Founding Fathers in a good way.
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:02.203]  They're gunners, they're hunters, they're fishers.
[02:04:02.283 --> 02:04:06.187]  I mean, they're everything that you talk about of that fight.
[02:04:06.648 --> 02:04:10.753]  But the one key thing that holds them up from opening their minds
[02:04:11.133 --> 02:04:15.918]  Is thinking that they don't have to fight, because in that church, they don't teach Romans 13.
[02:04:16.018 --> 02:04:17.480]  In other words, I could tell you... No, no, no.
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:21.764]  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that it's all going to end anyways.
[02:04:22.064 --> 02:04:23.726]  And for the New Agers, they gave them 2012.
[02:04:23.846 --> 02:04:26.108]  Oh, well, why be involved?
[02:04:26.569 --> 02:04:27.470]  2012 is the end of the world.
[02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:28.170]  You see how they...
[02:04:29.068 --> 02:04:40.816]  Frank Herbert called it the Missionariat Protectorate, where they would implant grips to create false ideas of giving up and there's no point, so that when then they send in their control people, everybody would stand down.
[02:04:41.256 --> 02:04:41.796]  Great points.
[02:04:41.836 --> 02:04:43.137]  I know that's why we have the film.
[02:04:43.717 --> 02:04:45.579]  After the Tribulation, let no man deceive you.
[02:04:45.619 --> 02:04:47.840]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.521]  Your purchase supports us and the filmmakers.
[02:04:49.561 --> 02:04:50.322]  Very well done film.
[02:04:51.437 --> 02:04:55.984]  And believe me, this is like cyanide to the lies of the pre-trib stuff.
[02:04:56.004 --> 02:04:57.687]  And I'm not judging you if you're into pre-trib.
[02:04:57.707 --> 02:04:58.989]  If you think that's true, go ahead and believe it.
[02:05:01.417 --> 02:05:04.480]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:10.286]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:05:10.867 --> 02:05:14.070]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:16.032]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[02:05:16.352 --> 02:05:20.216]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[02:05:58.066 --> 02:06:00.228]  Again, that's GetSimpliSafe.com
[02:06:01.616 --> 02:06:02.616]  I had tried everything.
[02:06:02.676 --> 02:06:07.738]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:06:08.178 --> 02:06:12.659]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:06:12.999 --> 02:06:19.361]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:06:19.861 --> 02:06:30.351]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:06:31.072 --> 02:06:35.216]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:06:35.556 --> 02:06:41.581]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:06:41.822 --> 02:06:42.963]  Now, that's results.
[02:06:43.363 --> 02:06:55.853]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[02:07:01.738 --> 02:07:07.583]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:07:08.487 --> 02:07:14.390]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[02:07:15.231 --> 02:07:25.316]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[02:07:26.196 --> 02:07:29.498]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:07:30.338 --> 02:07:36.522]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:07:37.242 --> 02:07:47.673]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[02:08:05.266 --> 02:08:07.547]  We are on the march.
[02:08:07.607 --> 02:08:09.308]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:08:10.189 --> 02:08:13.450]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.610 --> 02:08:21.514]  Alright, it's hour number three.
[02:08:21.554 --> 02:08:23.135]  I'm going right to your phone calls.
[02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:30.159]  And then if you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, citizens applaud defeat of firearms ban in Massachusetts.
[02:08:31.203 --> 02:08:32.484]  The problem is they've got our kids.
[02:08:33.204 --> 02:08:35.145]  I've actually had a Handgun Control, Inc.
[02:08:35.205 --> 02:08:42.187]  article I was in like 10 years ago go, it doesn't matter if you beat this bill now, we have control of the education system and your children.
[02:08:42.207 --> 02:08:45.209]  I probably read that quote like 25 times on air.
[02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:46.449]  It was in the Austin American Statesman.
[02:08:46.849 --> 02:08:47.670]  Doesn't matter!
[02:08:48.030 --> 02:08:49.310]  Long term!
[02:08:51.031 --> 02:08:52.612]  It's all about dominating.
[02:08:53.392 --> 02:08:55.473]  See, for the government type, that's how they move up.
[02:08:56.273 --> 02:08:58.014]  They move up by making you their slave.
[02:09:00.919 --> 02:09:04.581]  TSA apologizes for harassing another wheelchair-bound toddler.
[02:09:04.601 --> 02:09:05.622]  Yeah, they'll say, get up!
[02:09:05.962 --> 02:09:08.264]  I'm sorry, my son's a quadriplegic.
[02:09:08.484 --> 02:09:09.444]  Shut up, terrorist!
[02:09:09.484 --> 02:09:09.965]  Get back!
[02:09:10.905 --> 02:09:16.929]  Stocks plunge as Fed members admit endless bond buying will not fix economy.
[02:09:18.570 --> 02:09:21.552]  Sheriff responds to attacks over Second Revolution comments.
[02:09:21.572 --> 02:09:22.392]  We're going to be getting to that.
[02:09:22.432 --> 02:09:23.033]  It's powerful.
[02:09:23.553 --> 02:09:26.155]  Gun control was historically about repressing blacks.
[02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:28.190]  20 signs the U.S.
[02:09:28.230 --> 02:09:30.831]  economy is headed towards big trouble in the months ahead.
[02:09:30.971 --> 02:09:31.171]  Really?
[02:09:31.191 --> 02:09:31.652]  You think so?
[02:09:32.612 --> 02:09:33.453]  Killing the dollar.
[02:09:33.493 --> 02:09:37.675]  G20 and IMF push for global Fed, global currency, global government.
[02:09:37.995 --> 02:09:38.075]  Oh!
[02:09:39.085 --> 02:09:39.825]  As a solution.
[02:09:40.126 --> 02:09:41.386]  We did all this on purpose.
[02:09:41.446 --> 02:09:42.267]  Give us more power.
[02:09:42.647 --> 02:09:43.327]  That'll fix it.
[02:09:43.827 --> 02:09:48.810]  And then a huge online film festival launched video at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:50.471]  That's just some of the news on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:50.491 --> 02:09:52.171]  We'll look at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:09:52.191 --> 02:09:53.212]  We'll look at a bunch of other news.
[02:09:53.432 --> 02:09:54.853]  But I promise, let's go to your calls.
[02:09:54.913 --> 02:09:55.713]  I promise to go to calls.
[02:09:55.733 --> 02:09:56.193]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:56.233 --> 02:10:03.317]  We'll go to John, then Charles, then Sean, and then Chad, and then Casey, and then to the news.
[02:10:03.937 --> 02:10:05.878]  Let's go to John in New Jersey.
[02:10:05.938 --> 02:10:06.959]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:07.519]  Thank you for holding.
[02:10:12.524 --> 02:10:14.485]  I just had some points to go through.
[02:10:14.525 --> 02:10:29.135]  I know you get very frustrated sometimes, and quite frankly, so do I, because when I see people who are that asleep where you can say something that's out in the open, like the NDAA, for example,
[02:10:29.628 --> 02:10:37.195]  And they'll just come back at you trying to sound so smart and like they're so educated and just spin something.
[02:10:37.235 --> 02:10:39.918]  It's good to spray viruses on cutlets of meat.
[02:10:39.958 --> 02:10:41.059]  It's good to radiate it.
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:45.644]  It's good the Japanese are now eating human poop turned into steaks.
[02:10:46.164 --> 02:10:48.406]  It's good they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:10:48.727 --> 02:10:52.590]  I have articles where they're giving little kids flu shots and they're dying.
[02:10:53.251 --> 02:10:55.412]  And then the government goes, we don't know why they're dying.
[02:10:55.432 --> 02:10:56.833]  We're not going to indict the parents.
[02:10:57.194 --> 02:11:00.456]  And then it comes out they were injected a day before with a flu shot.
[02:11:00.996 --> 02:11:01.776]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:11:01.937 --> 02:11:03.838]  You take the flu shot, sometimes you die.
[02:11:04.078 --> 02:11:07.580]  The stinking insert, the CDC's own site says it may kill you.
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:10.102]  But people are like, oh, there's no way they're killing us.
[02:11:10.442 --> 02:11:11.623]  That's my point.
[02:11:12.363 --> 02:11:14.865]  People say, how did the Germans put up with what they put up with?
[02:11:15.205 --> 02:11:17.286]  By successive approximation.
[02:11:17.847 --> 02:11:19.307]  By incrementalism.
[02:11:19.348 --> 02:11:19.848]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:11:21.269 --> 02:11:34.094]  No, yes, because basically our problem as a country is we're too used to having everything done for us, where people are at the point where they won't go out and actually read the insert of the flu shot.
[02:11:34.114 --> 02:11:36.955]  They'll just take it because the establishment says to take it.
[02:11:37.275 --> 02:11:38.936]  And people don't think that they need guns.
[02:11:38.956 --> 02:11:40.377]  Well, I've never needed it before.
[02:11:40.417 --> 02:11:45.059]  Well, trust me, when this whole thing starts, you're going to be pretty sorry if you don't have one.
[02:11:45.659 --> 02:11:48.460]  And basically everyone is too used to the fact that we haven't had
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.919]  A large-scale national crisis in quite a while.
[02:11:52.563 --> 02:12:03.929]  To the point that everyone's just so lethargic now, which my response to that would be, shouldn't we in the whole liberty movement be promoting things more along the lines of... No, no, that's it.
[02:12:03.949 --> 02:12:12.334]  But if we can get the yuppies who are riding bikes every day and all that to show some energy about the Bill of Rights and Constitution that produced all the wealth.
[02:12:12.574 --> 02:12:21.039]  I mean, even if you're a cynical person that doesn't care about anybody, not having liberty makes it a very bad place to live with no due process and where, you know,
[02:12:21.699 --> 02:12:23.180]  Horse meets the tip of the iceberg.
[02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:28.581]  It's bad drugs, it's bad food, it's bad water, it's bad air, by design.
[02:12:28.921 --> 02:12:32.002]  It's a lying government that's already taken the pension funds.
[02:12:32.062 --> 02:12:33.122]  The money's already gone.
[02:12:33.663 --> 02:12:36.203]  They're just getting martial law ready for when the shoe drops.
[02:12:36.563 --> 02:12:38.124]  You know, that's another thing.
[02:12:38.444 --> 02:12:42.265]  People are like, oh, so what if the government has two billion rounds and training for gun confiscation?
[02:12:42.605 --> 02:12:44.746]  I don't own guns, you idiots.
[02:12:45.266 --> 02:12:46.007]  What do you think?
[02:12:46.027 --> 02:12:48.670]  That's a civil war they're gearing up for.
[02:12:49.211 --> 02:12:51.033]  That means an end to all of this.
[02:12:51.353 --> 02:12:52.915]  And they've taken down Argentina.
[02:12:53.216 --> 02:12:54.597]  They've taken down Brazil.
[02:12:54.918 --> 02:12:56.620]  They've taken down Nigeria.
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:12:58.362]  They've taken down Greece.
[02:12:58.682 --> 02:12:59.563]  They've taken down...
[02:13:01.845 --> 02:13:14.807]  Spain, Portugal, once prosperous areas have protests with five million people and burning buildings every week and people starving to death and cops killing people and it's not even news anymore.
[02:13:15.347 --> 02:13:16.928]  I want everybody to get it straight here.
[02:13:17.408 --> 02:13:19.768]  The globalists are running revolutions worldwide.
[02:13:19.948 --> 02:13:21.249]  They're putting Al Qaeda in.
[02:13:21.609 --> 02:13:26.850]  They will tear this country from one end to the other and set off shore while it happens.
[02:13:27.610 --> 02:13:28.990]  They've taught so many yuppies.
[02:13:29.730 --> 02:13:30.470]  They go, I don't care.
[02:13:30.530 --> 02:13:31.251]  Kill the Iraqis.
[02:13:31.271 --> 02:13:31.911]  They're not human.
[02:13:32.491 --> 02:13:35.993]  Do you think the globalists who don't think Iraqis are human think you're human either?
[02:13:36.313 --> 02:13:39.315]  They respect them a lot more than your big lazy butt.
[02:13:39.735 --> 02:13:43.257]  They think of you as a dumb animal who they don't want to take care of anymore.
[02:13:43.377 --> 02:13:44.217]  You're like, but I work.
[02:13:44.477 --> 02:13:44.977]  They don't care.
[02:13:45.017 --> 02:13:46.838]  They see the resources as theirs.
[02:13:47.158 --> 02:13:48.239]  They don't think you're human.
[02:13:48.559 --> 02:13:49.940]  They don't think you deserve to live.
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:52.221]  And here's my beef with the globalists.
[02:13:52.542 --> 02:13:56.605]  Maybe some of the public who wants to be slaves and hear this, maybe they do deserve to be slaves.
[02:13:57.105 --> 02:13:58.126]  I don't, okay?
[02:13:58.466 --> 02:13:59.547]  I'm not going to be a slave.
[02:13:59.767 --> 02:14:01.468]  And the globalists say, well, you better join us.
[02:14:01.769 --> 02:14:06.292]  I'm not joining a bunch of people that are into child sex slavery and stuff.
[02:14:06.612 --> 02:14:07.493]  You people are evil!
[02:14:07.853 --> 02:14:13.297]  I'm not joining the big crowd of lazy, self-propelled stomachs, and I'm not joining the New World Order either.
[02:14:13.658 --> 02:14:14.959]  I want my republic back.
[02:14:15.359 --> 02:14:23.993]  And that happens by cutting all these people off welfare, and making everybody tough, and cutting the corporate welfare off, and arresting these globalists, and hanging their asses high!
[02:14:24.393 --> 02:14:25.255]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:26.749 --> 02:14:28.770]  Hey, what's up my brother, how you doing?
[02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:32.111]  I just want to talk to you about the WWE and PlayStation 4.
[02:14:55.206 --> 02:14:56.567]  I'm a big martial arts fan.
[02:14:56.587 --> 02:14:59.428]  I've been watching the WWE since I was two years old.
[02:15:00.369 --> 02:15:04.330]  And just noticing it now, what they've done with Jack Swagger.
[02:15:04.811 --> 02:15:12.774]  They've been laying the groundwork for about 15 years to demonize patriots and anyone who just identifies themselves as an American national.
[02:15:13.954 --> 02:15:16.896]  It started with Kurt Angle, because he started back in 1999.
[02:15:17.856 --> 02:15:22.158]  He's really just the basic, same gimmick as Jack Swagger.
[02:15:22.859 --> 02:15:26.604]  No, all American, American, you know, American hero, American wrestler.
[02:15:27.405 --> 02:15:29.528]  And he's been a heel when he first started.
[02:15:29.548 --> 02:15:30.169]  He was a heel.
[02:15:31.170 --> 02:15:31.931]  That's a bad guy.
[02:15:32.392 --> 02:15:37.739]  And he turned to a baby face because the crowd was so they were so into him because he was so talented.
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:40.443]  But Jack Swagger started about five, six years ago.
[02:15:41.235 --> 02:15:42.517]  And he's always been a heel.
[02:15:42.557 --> 02:15:43.918]  He's never been a good guy ever.
[02:15:44.438 --> 02:15:48.763]  So, I mean, with his new gimmick coming back, he came back about three weeks ago.
[02:15:48.823 --> 02:15:59.854]  He was supposed to be a good guy, but they changed their mind because all of a sudden they decided to turn Alberto Del Rio, who was a bad guy since he started, all overnight he was a good guy.
[02:15:59.954 --> 02:16:00.755]  He was a babyface.
[02:16:01.917 --> 02:16:04.980]  I mean, they just... Well, no, I mean, there's nothing worse than a white person.
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:12.747]  And so, obviously, you know, he's the new bad guy who wants sovereignty, and then he's going to be defeated by the loving Mexican.
[02:16:13.168 --> 02:16:16.451]  And this is to make... because a lot of people that watch wrestling watch it for the entertainment.
[02:16:16.471 --> 02:16:17.512]  It is very funny, interesting.
[02:16:18.172 --> 02:16:27.323]  But others, you know, there are people there who think it's real, and this creates that background, and then they go, all the problems in America are the Mexicans!
[02:16:27.963 --> 02:16:29.525]  And that's obviously not true.
[02:16:30.086 --> 02:16:38.375]  So then it discredits that if we want any sovereignty, and don't want a North American Union to be totally imploded, and Mexico's imploding, then you hate all Mexicans.
[02:16:39.113 --> 02:16:44.421]  When Mexicans that are Americans had any sense, which a lot of them do, they'd say, wait a minute, Mexico's imploding.
[02:16:44.642 --> 02:16:47.185]  It doesn't help Mexicans to bring them here and lower all our wages.
[02:16:47.506 --> 02:16:49.309]  We need to get Mexico back as a free country.
[02:16:49.890 --> 02:16:52.193]  And so it's purely meant to create division.
[02:16:52.213 --> 02:16:53.776]  And people say, Alex, it's just entertainment.
[02:16:55.014 --> 02:16:59.698]  They admit the Department of Defense and the Globalist fund these anti-patriot, anti-veteran.
[02:16:59.718 --> 02:17:00.359]  I want to say that again.
[02:17:00.679 --> 02:17:08.766]  The Department of Justice and Defense fund anti-patriot military messages because they hate the veterans.
[02:17:09.086 --> 02:17:10.588]  Because they're not under their control anymore.
[02:17:10.928 --> 02:17:12.009]  I mean, this is treasonous.
[02:17:12.049 --> 02:17:13.249]  This is ridiculous.
[02:17:13.449 --> 02:17:16.151]  Obviously, the bad guys demonize the veterans.
[02:17:16.411 --> 02:17:18.392]  The bad guys demonize George Washington.
[02:17:18.632 --> 02:17:20.313]  The bad guys demonize the family.
[02:17:20.553 --> 02:17:22.074]  The bad guys push abortion.
[02:17:22.294 --> 02:17:23.975]  The bad guys push socialism.
[02:17:24.235 --> 02:17:29.958]  And look what the media pushes, including Fox News Corp properties, who claim they're so conservative.
[02:17:30.538 --> 02:17:33.019]  If Rupert Murdoch was a real conservative, he brags.
[02:17:33.039 --> 02:17:34.040]  We have the promo video.
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:39.003]  He's the chairman, I guess the president of News Corp.
[02:17:39.363 --> 02:17:40.404]  We played it many years ago.
[02:17:40.764 --> 02:17:41.524]  Call Paul Watson.
[02:17:41.564 --> 02:17:42.825]  It's so old, he'll know how to find it.
[02:17:42.865 --> 02:17:44.046]  It's something like News Corp.
[02:17:44.086 --> 02:17:45.687]  promotes carbon taxes.
[02:17:46.027 --> 02:17:46.668]  And they brag.
[02:17:47.028 --> 02:17:54.132]  Here are all of our current lineup of shows promoting carbon taxes and carbon footprint and bringing in the new green economy.
[02:17:54.472 --> 02:17:56.314]  And then they show all the shows they're doing it.
[02:17:56.874 --> 02:17:59.195]  See, they have to control the conservative movement.
[02:17:59.495 --> 02:18:00.956]  They have to be loyal opposition.
[02:18:00.976 --> 02:18:01.637]  Do you understand that?
[02:18:02.685 --> 02:18:03.085]  Right, right.
[02:18:03.105 --> 02:18:03.526]  You're correct.
[02:18:04.006 --> 02:18:14.273]  Um, the thing is, if the WWE, I mean, I would say since the Iraq war, they have been, uh, the ground floor for anything that's propaganda.
[02:18:14.393 --> 02:18:18.636]  They, they, if there's propaganda, they're going to do it, especially like in the last four years.
[02:18:18.656 --> 02:18:23.999]  And when Linda started her campaign, um, they would just straight up the commercial.
[02:18:24.039 --> 02:18:28.282]  They would just all, they will be two hours straight just entertainment, but
[02:18:29.308 --> 02:18:34.271]  Four years ago, they just started, like, they go to commercial in the match, here's propaganda.
[02:18:34.291 --> 02:18:35.472]  The WWE is with the troops.
[02:18:35.512 --> 02:18:38.934]  So we just, we'll stop the whole show, we want to thank the troops for everything they're doing.
[02:18:38.974 --> 02:18:41.116]  No, it's part of living in a North Korean society.
[02:18:41.136 --> 02:18:42.296]  It doesn't mean thank the troops.
[02:18:42.616 --> 02:18:43.877]  They thank the police state.
[02:18:44.117 --> 02:18:45.378]  They thank the global empire.
[02:18:45.618 --> 02:18:48.940]  They thank the New World Order to get you ready for troops on the streets.
[02:18:49.561 --> 02:18:53.523]  Kentucky Derby, NFL, troops as the security, armed troops.
[02:18:53.983 --> 02:18:54.764]  They're getting us ready.
[02:18:54.904 --> 02:18:56.065]  I really appreciate your call, sir.
[02:18:57.577 --> 02:19:15.063]  And again, whoever that guy is with Jack Swaggart, his manager, the other actor, has a red Yosemite Sam, Zeb Coulter has a red Yosemite Sam mustache, and he's short like Yosemite Sam, and he goes, I hate rabbits.
[02:19:16.924 --> 02:19:18.784]  I hate Mexicans.
[02:19:19.445 --> 02:19:25.287]  I mean, they directly, I know in the behind the scenes meetings, they're like, you will now start looking like Yosemite Sam.
[02:19:26.068 --> 02:19:28.843]  Or you look like Yosemite Sam, you'll go out and do this.
[02:19:31.884 --> 02:19:40.369]  You've got Karl Rove saying, open the borders, world government, socialism is good, the Tea Party is evil, and it's weak, and it's dead, and it's over.
[02:19:41.250 --> 02:19:43.291]  And you've got the same thing coming out of the WWE.
[02:19:44.032 --> 02:19:46.213]  That's because the Tea Party is the only hope.
[02:19:47.354 --> 02:19:48.955]  The ideas of the real Tea Party.
[02:19:49.395 --> 02:19:52.977]  The real libertarian constitutional rediscovery of America.
[02:19:53.377 --> 02:19:55.739]  We need 1498 part deuce.
[02:19:56.319 --> 02:19:58.781]  We'll be right back with Sean and others.

[02:22:05.745 --> 02:22:09.308]  The colon needs proper alignment for faster, more effective elimination.

[02:22:31.506 --> 02:22:35.809]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.989 --> 02:22:41.613]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.713 --> 02:22:45.056]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.296 --> 02:22:47.857]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:23:03.667 --> 02:23:08.089]  In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public.
[02:23:08.349 --> 02:23:10.910]  And we're still selling them almost 30 years later.

[02:24:22.764 --> 02:24:25.986]  Got a special InfoWars Nightly News coming up tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[02:24:26.086 --> 02:24:29.067]  The destination is PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:33.009]  Let's talk to Sean from New York.
[02:24:33.570 --> 02:24:34.710]  New York City!
[02:24:34.730 --> 02:24:35.431]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:24:36.394 --> 02:24:37.755]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[02:24:37.895 --> 02:24:40.416]  I wanted to talk to you about some things that are fundamental.
[02:24:40.436 --> 02:24:47.639]  When I try to explain to people about an elite globalist agenda, most of the time they're going to associate it with Illuminati.
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:51.781]  And the thing is, is that they want to know, like, who?
[02:24:52.221 --> 02:24:53.542]  Who are these people?
[02:24:54.002 --> 02:25:02.386]  But actually, I read some investigations, and I read that once you, you know, you, you sift through that bureaucracy and those
[02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:15.859]  Subsidiaries, and the parent companies, and the megacorporations, and the conglomerates, and the monopolies, that there's, there's owners, maybe, there's a handful of people, maybe less than 200 people, that actually own everything.
[02:25:15.879 --> 02:25:24.925]  No, you're right, there are less than 200, and they're busy trying to make us totally poor, not to control us, but so they can get us in a position to then kill us.
[02:25:25.086 --> 02:25:28.388]  I mean, and they write all these publications saying they're going to do it.
[02:25:28.428 --> 02:25:29.248]  I mean, you guys type in
[02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:34.953]  Rockefeller and others, rich, mean, and secret to discuss overpopulation.
[02:25:35.474 --> 02:25:36.334]  And it was all over the news.
[02:25:36.615 --> 02:25:39.497]  Well, yeah, they're setting up a global government to reduce population.
[02:25:39.977 --> 02:25:42.500]  And then they average up, he goes, there are too many people.
[02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:47.063]  Yeah, dummy, and they're putting poison in your water, you moron.
[02:25:48.064 --> 02:25:51.907]  Stop imagining you're part of the controllers killing people.
[02:25:52.327 --> 02:25:53.488]  You know, reflected glory.
[02:25:53.768 --> 02:25:54.428]  I'm part of it.
[02:25:54.788 --> 02:25:55.949]  I agree with the plan.
[02:25:56.129 --> 02:25:57.290]  Then kill yourself!
[02:25:57.490 --> 02:25:58.471]  I don't want to die!
[02:25:58.491 --> 02:26:00.952]  And I'm not signed on to this plan.
[02:26:01.413 --> 02:26:02.313]  Not in my name.
[02:26:02.594 --> 02:26:03.634]  I don't want to go to hell.
[02:26:04.275 --> 02:26:09.038]  And even if you don't believe in hell, my gut doesn't like hurting innocent people.
[02:26:09.538 --> 02:26:10.919]  So I'm not signed on to it.
[02:26:10.939 --> 02:26:13.741]  I hate certain innocent people.
[02:26:14.141 --> 02:26:14.681]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[02:26:14.721 --> 02:26:15.402]  Go ahead, Dashaun.
[02:26:16.513 --> 02:26:45.824]  Yeah, so it seems as if they control everything and their family lineage is on top of that hierarchy and it just continues, but I know that you talk a lot about the left and the right and it just so happened that I had heard about Obama when he won the candidacy to be a Democrat versus Hillary Clinton or Bilderberg was in town at that time and I remember that they were all in the press plane
[02:26:46.286 --> 02:26:52.650]  And he may have secretly met with Goldenberg with Hillary Clinton when he was elected.
[02:26:52.951 --> 02:26:53.431]  No, I know.
[02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:54.272]  I was there.
[02:26:54.412 --> 02:26:54.952]  Imagine.
[02:26:55.352 --> 02:26:57.073]  It's one of the biggest stories in America.
[02:26:57.874 --> 02:26:58.695]  Where is Hillary?
[02:26:58.735 --> 02:26:59.355]  Where's Obama?
[02:26:59.375 --> 02:27:00.416]  They've disappeared for a day.
[02:27:00.796 --> 02:27:01.196]  I'm there.
[02:27:01.496 --> 02:27:02.277]  Secret Service.
[02:27:02.337 --> 02:27:03.358]  Marines guarding them.
[02:27:03.838 --> 02:27:04.839]  Chantilly, Virginia.
[02:27:05.279 --> 02:27:08.101]  I call Fox, CNN, local channels.
[02:27:08.621 --> 02:27:09.162]  No one.
[02:27:10.533 --> 02:27:11.574]  No one covered it.
[02:27:12.475 --> 02:27:15.057]  No one covered it but the Epoch Times.
[02:27:15.938 --> 02:27:22.064]  And then I think Drudge linked to that, that there was a Bilderberg meeting, but Epoch Times was like, well, we don't know they're in there.
[02:27:22.084 --> 02:27:23.085]  I'm like, no, we have sources.
[02:27:23.125 --> 02:27:27.128]  No, the Secret Service drove by and aimed MP5 machine guns at us.
[02:27:28.169 --> 02:27:29.491]  Hillary and Obama are there.
[02:27:30.171 --> 02:27:31.653]  Imagine, you know where they are.
[02:27:32.739 --> 02:27:36.363]  The media knew too, but they didn't want to show the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:27:36.563 --> 02:27:40.587]  So the media showed what good little, good little minions they were.
[02:27:40.928 --> 02:27:42.429]  That's why they may have Bilderberg.
[02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:47.454]  It's always three years in Europe, one year in the US or Canada, North America.
[02:27:47.995 --> 02:27:52.320]  Now they may have it the same place this year because other media, they don't even have control in Europe.
[02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:55.363]  And people, you know, where there were literal torches in Switzerland.
[02:27:57.614 --> 02:28:13.626]  So, so, again, America is so controlled that the only media that covered it this last year in Virginia was InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, DrudgeReport.com, and Foreign News London Guardian.
[02:28:15.027 --> 02:28:17.789]  But again, that's why the mainstream media has hardly any readers now.
[02:28:18.130 --> 02:28:21.712]  It doesn't matter if they lie and won't say it's happening.
[02:28:22.953 --> 02:28:23.494]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:25.017 --> 02:28:28.379]  Yeah, so it did appear that he, you know, he vanished at that time.
[02:28:28.419 --> 02:28:36.043]  But I try to stress to people, it doesn't matter if it's Obama or if it's Romney, it's controlled under the same thing.
[02:28:36.083 --> 02:28:43.867]  These financiers and the finances and the bankers and they're controlling the politics and the military.
[02:28:43.887 --> 02:28:46.608]  That's what I got to say.
[02:28:47.548 --> 02:28:48.009]  I hear you.
[02:28:48.229 --> 02:28:48.889]  I hear you, my friend.
[02:28:48.909 --> 02:28:49.449]  Good to hear from you.
[02:28:49.489 --> 02:28:50.190]  Let's jam in another.
[02:28:50.670 --> 02:28:52.291]  Chad in California, you're on the air.
[02:28:53.991 --> 02:28:56.212]  Hi, thank you for having me on.
[02:28:56.712 --> 02:28:58.633]  You're doing a wonderful thing, Mr. Jones.
[02:28:59.173 --> 02:29:02.754]  Hopefully we can follow you a lot more and do the rest.
[02:29:02.874 --> 02:29:10.017]  If you don't mind me giving just a little bit of a two quotes from the Bible, and then I will give you a thing.
[02:29:10.037 --> 02:29:11.398]  I would love it.
[02:29:11.718 --> 02:29:12.518]  Do I have your permission?
[02:29:12.538 --> 02:29:14.619]  Sure, we're going to break in a minute, but just start your point now.
[02:29:14.679 --> 02:29:14.999]  Go ahead.
[02:29:15.579 --> 02:29:16.680]  Okay, then.
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:22.402]  For thee ought to say, if the Lord will, we shall live and do this or that.
[02:29:23.174 --> 02:29:25.676]  But now ye rejoice in the boastings.
[02:29:26.136 --> 02:29:28.018]  All such rejoicing is evil.
[02:29:28.418 --> 02:29:34.143]  Therefore to him that knoweth to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.
[02:29:35.024 --> 02:29:38.006]  And now for my actual point.
[02:29:39.668 --> 02:29:41.289]  My wife is an illegal alien.
[02:29:41.409 --> 02:29:41.949]  I'm a U.S.
[02:29:41.969 --> 02:29:42.390]  citizen.
[02:29:42.470 --> 02:29:42.830]  Hold on.
[02:29:42.850 --> 02:29:43.170]  Stay there.
[02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:45.232]  I'm going to come back to you on the other side of this quick break.
[02:29:45.592 --> 02:29:46.473]  Get your take on that.
[02:29:46.513 --> 02:29:48.255]  Then I'll get to some news and more of your calls.
[02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:50.982]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.483 --> 02:29:53.146]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.988 --> 02:29:56.874]  Alex Jones and the GCN Little Horny Toads.
[02:30:01.482 --> 02:30:02.803]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[02:30:03.043 --> 02:30:04.664]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[02:30:04.844 --> 02:30:06.945]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[02:30:07.185 --> 02:30:08.746]  What can you not live without?
[02:30:08.906 --> 02:30:10.347]  What is your greatest dependency?
[02:30:10.627 --> 02:30:11.327]  Is it your guns?
[02:30:11.607 --> 02:30:12.228]  Is it your home?
[02:30:12.548 --> 02:30:13.668]  No, it's food.
[02:30:13.989 --> 02:30:15.849]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[02:30:16.090 --> 02:30:19.371]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[02:30:19.591 --> 02:30:20.652]  Don't be dependent.
[02:30:20.832 --> 02:30:21.773]  Be self-sufficient.
[02:30:21.913 --> 02:30:23.493]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[02:30:23.574 --> 02:30:24.234]  Feed yourself.
[02:30:24.674 --> 02:30:26.775]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:30:26.895 --> 02:30:30.236]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.

[02:33:15.515 --> 02:33:20.118]  Okay, let me go back to this caller, then I need to get into some more of the news, and then back into your calls.
[02:33:20.578 --> 02:33:34.967]  But we did find the, I guess, three-minute video from 2006, with News Corp putting out an internal promo video to themselves about, good job writers and workers, we're propagandizing people effectively.
[02:33:35.845 --> 02:33:36.726]  That's the thing with the public.
[02:33:36.766 --> 02:33:43.352]  I'm like, hey, the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice is paying to have anti-gun messages in TV shows.
[02:33:43.692 --> 02:33:44.493]  Yeah, right.
[02:33:44.533 --> 02:33:49.177]  Next you're going to tell me there's horse meat in these TV dinners.
[02:33:50.339 --> 02:33:53.262]  Next you're going to tell me that Aspartame's bad.
[02:33:53.282 --> 02:33:56.905]  Next you're going to say we might want to watch the government.
[02:33:57.125 --> 02:33:59.047]  Everybody knows you do whatever the government says.
[02:33:59.487 --> 02:34:00.668]  That's common sense.
[02:34:01.269 --> 02:34:05.132]  America was founded on socialism and the end of the family.
[02:34:05.152 --> 02:34:07.474]  Hi, I listen to NPR.
[02:34:07.494 --> 02:34:14.060]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, head of Homeland Security.
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:16.182]  Trust no one but the government.
[02:34:17.642 --> 02:34:18.463]  So that's coming up.
[02:34:18.483 --> 02:34:20.524]  If I can shut up long enough.
[02:34:21.325 --> 02:34:24.628]  Let's go ahead and go back to... Who was I just talking to?
[02:34:24.688 --> 02:34:25.048]  Chad?
[02:34:26.489 --> 02:34:26.889]  Chad?
[02:34:27.610 --> 02:34:28.311]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:34:28.491 --> 02:34:30.192]  You were saying your wife isn't illegal.
[02:34:30.212 --> 02:34:30.552]  Go ahead.
[02:34:31.253 --> 02:34:43.563]  Yeah, basically what I wanted to find out is my research into the Constitution and understanding it, really our government only has the right to say if you're a citizen or not, not on the borders.
[02:34:43.623 --> 02:34:47.206]  And I do think that it is a thing that needs to be addressed and I'm not against
[02:34:47.796 --> 02:34:48.637]  Well, here's the issue.
[02:34:48.857 --> 02:34:51.799]  Because of sham marriages, they make it super hard.
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:58.445]  And if you're European, they make it almost impossible to immigrate here because they've got deals with Europe to keep good tax slaves there.
[02:34:58.946 --> 02:35:05.912]  They only bring in poor, uneducated workers, whether they be white, Hispanic, black, Asian, from around the world, to drive down wages.
[02:35:05.952 --> 02:35:07.213]  That's the main immigrant force.
[02:35:07.693 --> 02:35:09.134]  The corporations are clear on that.
[02:35:10.057 --> 02:35:11.177]  And to be a political arm.
[02:35:12.178 --> 02:35:17.059]  So, I mean, if you're an illegal alien from Mexico and flaunt things that are in the right group, you're above the law.
[02:35:17.459 --> 02:35:28.643]  But if you've got a woman you're really married to, you know, what is it, like five years it takes or whatever, you know, of you guys together, last time I checked, to really prove, well, I mean, I'm sure you're an expert on it.
[02:35:28.843 --> 02:35:30.683]  I mean, you're married, is she really your wife?
[02:35:30.703 --> 02:35:31.443]  How long have you been married?
[02:35:32.044 --> 02:35:39.466]  We've been married for seven years and definitely a big witness to the sham of our immigration system.
[02:35:40.259 --> 02:35:44.106]  One of the reasons why we're having problems is the fact that we actually told the truth.
[02:35:44.787 --> 02:35:48.794]  And because of that, now we're this oddity case that we can't have anything go forward.
[02:35:49.294 --> 02:35:49.976]  No, of course.
[02:35:50.056 --> 02:35:51.057]  No, no, no.
[02:35:51.158 --> 02:35:52.159]  It's all done on purpose.
[02:35:52.179 --> 02:35:54.063]  The entire system is meant...
[02:35:54.918 --> 02:36:05.927]  If you walked in like Akron, or they've done it in Social Security offices, and said, I'm running child slaves, I'm shipping them in crates, bound, I want to give you part of that money, and they're like, hey, we'll tell you how to run the black op right now.
[02:36:06.408 --> 02:36:08.410]  Yeah, we bring in, yeah, it's a fantastic job.
[02:36:08.770 --> 02:36:10.091]  Yeah, just make sure you got them in the school.
[02:36:10.711 --> 02:36:11.712]  These little kids are pimping out.
[02:36:11.732 --> 02:36:12.173]  How old are they?
[02:36:12.193 --> 02:36:13.174]  Oh, they're 10 years old, good.
[02:36:13.214 --> 02:36:14.275]  Yeah, we'll help you with that.
[02:36:15.135 --> 02:36:19.859]  As long as you're a hardcore criminal gangster, you're going to Valhalla, son.
[02:36:19.879 --> 02:36:23.381]  I mean, this whole system is run by criminals for criminals.
[02:36:24.022 --> 02:36:24.882]  That's what I'm telling you.
[02:36:24.922 --> 02:36:26.263]  This isn't just rhetoric.
[02:36:26.764 --> 02:36:28.465]  The government's now converted to tyranny.
[02:36:28.825 --> 02:36:38.172]  They've got lots of Dudley Do-rights that, you know, write you tickets and, you know, take your kid or whatever, who really think they're doing good for America.
[02:36:38.786 --> 02:36:40.467]  Well, I hate lawbreakers.
[02:36:41.448 --> 02:36:43.629]  But meanwhile, the real lawbreakers are running things.
[02:36:44.109 --> 02:36:45.370]  And I'm sorry to hear that's happened to you.
[02:36:45.390 --> 02:36:46.451]  So what's your final question?
[02:36:47.071 --> 02:36:49.752]  Well, actually, it's a final statement of things to do.
[02:36:50.853 --> 02:36:56.957]  Really, people go out and befriend everyone, especially the law enforcement.
[02:36:59.614 --> 02:37:04.397]  And that, to show them that you are human, you are a person, there is a reason for you.
[02:37:04.537 --> 02:37:07.679]  No, you have to treat the globalist minions like they're a criminal.
[02:37:08.259 --> 02:37:10.860]  And like when they kidnap a kid, you go, we love little Jenny.
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:12.181]  Here's her dog Spot.
[02:37:12.501 --> 02:37:13.702]  Her grandmother is crying.
[02:37:14.022 --> 02:37:14.923]  She's a human being.
[02:37:15.263 --> 02:37:17.764]  Please, if you haven't killed her yet, please let her go.
[02:37:18.224 --> 02:37:18.845]  Just let her go.
[02:37:19.605 --> 02:37:22.787]  Now, that works with some criminals who are kind of mentally ill and twisted.
[02:37:23.088 --> 02:37:24.729]  The psychopaths enjoy it more.
[02:37:25.369 --> 02:37:32.054]  But yeah, so begging them, the wrong ones they'll get all demonic looking and have a demon feed off of that, a psychic vampire feed.
[02:37:32.414 --> 02:37:34.135]  But some of them you can actually get to.
[02:37:35.156 --> 02:37:39.479]  But I've noticed a lot of them acting, you know, saying I'm human, they go, I know and I'm not.
[02:37:41.380 --> 02:37:43.302]  Because, you know, their spirit's going straight to hell.
[02:37:43.342 --> 02:37:44.042]  They're already in hell.
[02:37:44.082 --> 02:37:44.683]  They already love it.
[02:37:47.344 --> 02:37:48.085]  Not to fight.
[02:37:48.621 --> 02:37:56.444]  But to show that your character is of godly nature that you love, but it does not mean that we do not fight this.
[02:37:56.464 --> 02:37:59.085]  Although the best thing to do is fight the New World Order.
[02:37:59.945 --> 02:38:02.726]  Fight them, laugh at them, spit at them.
[02:38:02.786 --> 02:38:06.488]  They're degenerate filth and scum and ugly and weak.
[02:38:07.308 --> 02:38:09.809]  They'll be overrun in the end and they will fail.
[02:38:10.189 --> 02:38:11.190]  That's what you need to do.
[02:38:11.770 --> 02:38:12.870]  Because they already know it.
[02:38:13.170 --> 02:38:14.651]  They already know their place has been prepared.
[02:38:15.865 --> 02:38:17.145]  All right, I appreciate your call, Chad.
[02:38:17.585 --> 02:38:19.486]  All right, let's take one more while I settle down.
[02:38:20.166 --> 02:38:21.126]  One more while I settle down.
[02:38:21.567 --> 02:38:23.167]  Let's talk to Casey in Georgia.
[02:38:23.187 --> 02:38:24.127]  Casey, you're on the air.
[02:38:25.368 --> 02:38:26.008]  Hey, Alex.
[02:38:26.368 --> 02:38:26.688]  Hey, buddy.
[02:38:27.928 --> 02:38:29.249]  Let me get on speaker one sec.
[02:38:29.969 --> 02:38:30.329]  All right.
[02:38:32.729 --> 02:38:33.510]  How you doing, partner?
[02:38:34.770 --> 02:38:38.391]  Yeah, I got a YouTube video up of what happened to me last night.
[02:38:38.591 --> 02:38:39.951]  I'm going to say the title real quick.
[02:38:40.011 --> 02:38:42.212]  It's Georgia car women's fire.
[02:38:43.983 --> 02:38:45.424]  Georgia Fire what?
[02:38:46.324 --> 02:38:48.865]  Oh, Georgia Car Lemon Fire.
[02:38:49.305 --> 02:38:51.105]  Georgia Car Lemon Fire.
[02:38:51.946 --> 02:38:52.386]  Georgia.
[02:38:53.066 --> 02:38:54.826]  Georgia Fire Lemon Fire.
[02:38:55.767 --> 02:38:58.328]  Oh, that's... Georgia Car Lemon Fire.
[02:38:58.648 --> 02:38:58.988]  Sorry about that.
[02:38:59.008 --> 02:39:00.508]  That's almost like a brainwashing term.
[02:39:01.228 --> 02:39:02.909]  Georgia Fire Lemon Lemon.
[02:39:03.609 --> 02:39:03.989]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.690]  All right.
[02:39:05.010 --> 02:39:06.010]  Well, you guys go find that.
[02:39:06.210 --> 02:39:06.530]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:06.990]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:39:07.010 --> 02:39:07.671]  All right.
[02:39:07.731 --> 02:39:12.292]  Well, anyway, this car caught fire right next to my convenience store last night and
[02:39:12.884 --> 02:39:16.187]  I was at my house and I rushed out with my fire extinguisher and I put it out.
[02:39:16.607 --> 02:39:22.132]  When I go to spray it back a second time, the officer says, um, somebody grab that man.
[02:39:22.332 --> 02:39:23.333]  Do you want to be arrested?
[02:39:25.416 --> 02:39:27.077]  Oh yeah, you don't have slaves.
[02:39:27.457 --> 02:39:30.518]  Pretty soon you'll be arrested for trying to wipe your own hind end, and I'm not kidding.
[02:39:30.538 --> 02:39:34.579]  I mean, they would have toilet safety police if they could, directly out of South Park.
[02:39:34.959 --> 02:39:36.560]  And that's the message of government.
[02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:38.321]  You're a low-down scum.
[02:39:39.401 --> 02:39:44.143]  You're not allowed to protect yourself while your wife's being raped with your fist in England.
[02:39:44.983 --> 02:39:49.845]  If you fight the guy off, they will throw you in prison for a decade.
[02:39:51.055 --> 02:39:57.099]  Well, after that I stepped back and I started filming, and well, about 14 minutes into the video he comes back up and he says, sorry.
[02:39:57.119 --> 02:39:59.761]  Well, he kind of says he's sorry in an embarrassing way, and he says,
[02:40:21.325 --> 02:40:23.707]  Well, I told him I was well within my rights to put out that fire.
[02:40:23.727 --> 02:40:26.890]  It's going to burn down my family's store, our livelihood, our income.
[02:40:27.971 --> 02:40:34.336]  But more than that, I've been having trouble with the city here because my- How dare you try to run a business to pay them money, you filth!
[02:40:34.836 --> 02:40:35.677]  You filth!
[02:40:36.758 --> 02:40:37.178]  You filth!
[02:40:37.218 --> 02:40:38.579]  Yeah, they do get quite a bit of our money.
[02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:41.682]  They're going to get more, too, boy.
[02:40:42.723 --> 02:40:44.184]  Obama's going to do more.
[02:40:45.709 --> 02:40:48.610]  Anyway, so, uh, yes, we now see the video.
[02:40:48.670 --> 02:40:50.231]  I can shot sideways.
[02:40:50.271 --> 02:40:51.192]  I like that camera angle.
[02:40:51.212 --> 02:40:51.892]  That's cinematic.
[02:40:52.492 --> 02:40:53.393]  Tell us what else happened.
[02:40:54.493 --> 02:40:56.794]  Well, not too much happened.
[02:40:56.834 --> 02:40:59.575]  Like I said, he comes up and he, there's a good little quote there.
[02:40:59.595 --> 02:41:04.678]  You might be able to make a meme out of somebody, but he comes up and he kind of apologizes.
[02:41:04.718 --> 02:41:06.478]  And at the end of it all, we're all right.
[02:41:06.498 --> 02:41:09.260]  He's a local guy, but he was imperious.
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:13.201]  And you know, he wasn't at the end of the right to tell me that he'd arrest me for putting out a fire on my own property.
[02:41:13.562 --> 02:41:14.322]  I told him no such.
[02:41:16.107 --> 02:41:22.669]  Well, it's hard to believe that the progeny of people that carved out a continent might be able to put out a fire.
[02:41:23.629 --> 02:41:24.469]  Man, you're sick.
[02:41:25.709 --> 02:41:26.690]  What's wrong with you?
[02:41:26.910 --> 02:41:30.931]  Only someone in a uniform, pretty soon you'll have to wear a uniform to be able to swim.
[02:41:31.851 --> 02:41:33.251]  I mean, literally, to be able to walk.
[02:41:33.571 --> 02:41:35.572]  Only people that have uniforms will be able to walk.
[02:41:35.812 --> 02:41:43.654]  Maybe they'll chop our legs off at birth and say, only if your legs are chopped off, you know, or if you have a uniform you're allowed to have legs.
[02:41:43.674 --> 02:41:44.214]  How's that sound?
[02:41:45.287 --> 02:41:48.930]  No, that's... Well, I don't want... I'm never going to wear a uniform, sir.
[02:41:49.710 --> 02:41:50.951]  Anyway... Sir, do you have a license?
[02:41:50.991 --> 02:41:52.992]  Have you been properly trained to brush your teeth?
[02:41:54.213 --> 02:41:55.774]  No, I'm afraid not.
[02:41:55.914 --> 02:41:59.177]  I just... I don't know... Kindergarten they taught us that.
[02:41:59.317 --> 02:42:00.878]  That's the last time I remember.
[02:42:00.898 --> 02:42:02.959]  So government did teach you how to do that?
[02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:05.681]  Oh, I guess you... What about picking your nose?
[02:42:05.701 --> 02:42:06.522]  Did they teach you that as well?
[02:42:07.862 --> 02:42:08.063]  No.
[02:42:09.147 --> 02:42:11.028]  That might have come from instinct.
[02:42:11.409 --> 02:42:12.029]  It came from God.
[02:42:12.269 --> 02:42:13.730]  Man, this is evil what I'm hearing right now.
[02:42:14.210 --> 02:42:14.631]  Whoa!
[02:42:14.691 --> 02:42:15.771]  You mean from the state?
[02:42:15.791 --> 02:42:16.552]  You just said God?
[02:42:17.733 --> 02:42:18.513]  No, no, no.
[02:42:20.635 --> 02:42:22.796]  Did you just engage in sacrilege and blasphemy?
[02:42:23.457 --> 02:42:24.998]  Did you just say the state wasn't God?
[02:42:25.018 --> 02:42:26.739]  No, no, no.
[02:42:26.859 --> 02:42:27.419]  Not this guy.
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:29.300]  I know who I serve.
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:29.941]  I serve people.
[02:42:30.961 --> 02:42:31.422]  Well, there.
[02:42:31.482 --> 02:42:32.202]  That's why you're evil.
[02:42:33.403 --> 02:42:35.965]  Well, anyway, the Planning and Zoning guy, just last year he
[02:42:36.721 --> 02:42:40.803]  When my sister tried to fix up this house behind it, he said our property was condemned.
[02:42:40.963 --> 02:42:44.285]  He just said it was condemned and hoped we wouldn't fight it.
[02:42:45.625 --> 02:42:51.688]  But I fought it, and I found out that they do this sort of informal condemnation where they just refuse to issue building permits.
[02:42:51.748 --> 02:42:52.789]  No, no, they're God.
[02:42:53.969 --> 02:42:56.090]  They take people's kids for not taking vaccines.
[02:42:56.110 --> 02:42:56.970]  There's no law.
[02:42:57.171 --> 02:42:59.292]  They forcibly inject kids with no law.
[02:42:59.852 --> 02:43:00.612]  Kid dies.
[02:43:00.652 --> 02:43:03.113]  They arrest you even though they know they killed your kid.
[02:43:03.133 --> 02:43:04.234]  Because they're God.
[02:43:04.714 --> 02:43:06.114]  LA sends me letters going, we want $1,200.
[02:43:06.174 --> 02:43:09.215]  There's somebody hung up an InfoWars sign.
[02:43:09.435 --> 02:43:10.995]  And I'm like, well, what if it's an Obama sign?
[02:43:11.015 --> 02:43:11.716]  You gonna charge him?
[02:43:12.016 --> 02:43:15.416]  I go, you don't have any citation, any proof that I did that, any fact.
[02:43:15.436 --> 02:43:17.277]  And they just go, okay, the fine's gonna double.
[02:43:17.297 --> 02:43:17.737]  Well, good.
[02:43:17.757 --> 02:43:19.257]  And they're like, go ahead and sue us.
[02:43:19.277 --> 02:43:21.658]  We'll just use taxpayer money to pay it off.
[02:43:21.698 --> 02:43:22.378]  They don't care.
[02:43:22.638 --> 02:43:24.838]  It's, they want to take everything down.
[02:43:25.078 --> 02:43:26.999]  It's all about, they're in charge.
[02:43:28.519 --> 02:43:32.340]  Now, the planning and zoning officer, he'd come from the Department of Community Affairs in Atlanta.
[02:43:33.115 --> 02:43:39.161]  The Department of Community Affairs when I was doing my research yesterday, they are the ones who give out the grants for the dam from the feds.
[02:43:39.542 --> 02:43:44.607]  They also are the ones who give out the grants for the fluoride, so I'm tempted to file open records request on them.
[02:43:45.057 --> 02:44:10.352]  Sir, the health departments were set up in the 1890s in England, and by 1900 here, Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, all of it, and it was set up for, quote, racial hygiene, and at the Nuremberg trials, about half the defense was quoting out of the Margaret Sanger Planned Parenthood, Eugenics Society, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[02:44:11.212 --> 02:44:14.333]  Because the Nazis just did what they were taught to do.
[02:44:14.633 --> 02:44:18.914]  They just said Germans are only good, or Aryans, everybody else is dead.
[02:44:19.374 --> 02:44:21.215]  The globalists say everybody's dead.
[02:44:22.635 --> 02:44:25.156]  It's their job to make sure you get cancer and die.
[02:44:25.176 --> 02:44:27.037]  I know that sounds incredibly radical.
[02:44:27.297 --> 02:44:27.837]  It is!
[02:44:28.417 --> 02:44:29.497]  Reality's crazy!
[02:44:29.517 --> 02:44:30.458]  Appreciate your call.
[02:44:30.478 --> 02:44:31.198]  Let's get to some news.
[02:44:33.612 --> 02:44:34.312]  Look at this article.
[02:44:34.332 --> 02:44:37.774]  I'm going to cover this first because this ties into how we awaken and how we take America back.
[02:44:38.174 --> 02:44:39.795]  Sheriff responds to attacks.
[02:44:40.436 --> 02:44:42.677]  We have a document cam right on this bad boy right here.
[02:44:43.277 --> 02:44:45.398]  For TV viewers, right here is the document cam.
[02:44:45.478 --> 02:44:45.798]  Thank you.
[02:44:46.159 --> 02:44:49.180]  Sheriff responds to attacks over Second Amendment comments.
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:52.002]  The American people will decide when
[02:44:53.257 --> 02:44:54.638]  To push back, not me.
[02:44:55.318 --> 02:45:03.641]  And here is the Milwaukee Journal, Sheriff David Clark defends the parents on conspiracy-laden show.
[02:45:05.682 --> 02:45:14.025]  So now if we talk about our right, talk about the Bill of Rights, talk about the Constitution, neurotically document everything, this is a pejorative.
[02:45:15.226 --> 02:45:19.527]  This would be like a hundred years ago saying, don't listen to that guy saying he's got rights and we cheated him.
[02:45:19.867 --> 02:45:20.928]  He's an N-word.
[02:45:22.438 --> 02:45:24.539]  Or it'd be like in India, you know, with the untouchables.
[02:45:24.759 --> 02:45:26.260]  Don't listen to what that guy said!
[02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:27.281]  I didn't steal anything from him.
[02:45:27.521 --> 02:45:28.641]  He's an untouchable.
[02:45:28.922 --> 02:45:30.983]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:45:32.444 --> 02:45:33.764]  He's somebody that isn't a chump.
[02:45:34.305 --> 02:45:36.146]  He's somebody that doesn't believe known liars.
[02:45:36.426 --> 02:45:37.606]  He's somebody that's informed.
[02:45:37.786 --> 02:45:39.147]  He's somebody that gets things done.
[02:45:39.387 --> 02:45:41.208]  He's somebody that built his own media empire.
[02:45:41.529 --> 02:45:46.151]  Oh, no, no, no, it's just... No, he's somebody that's broken thousands of big stories.
[02:45:46.992 --> 02:45:49.073]  No, he's just that nobody.
[02:45:50.191 --> 02:45:53.452]  And the Tea Party's dead, and the Drudge Report's dead.
[02:45:53.632 --> 02:45:55.053]  I've been seeing that headline for 10 years.
[02:45:55.653 --> 02:46:01.194]  The Drudge Report's dead as its traffic goes up and up and up, as it gets more and more influential, the most influential.
[02:46:01.374 --> 02:46:02.295]  They have articles every week.
[02:46:02.475 --> 02:46:03.175]  Drudge Report's dead.
[02:46:03.375 --> 02:46:04.075]  Drudge Report's dead.
[02:46:04.275 --> 02:46:04.876]  Drudge Report's dead.
[02:46:05.116 --> 02:46:06.036]  Oh, Mark Twain's dead.
[02:46:06.256 --> 02:46:07.997]  Well, he is now, but back then, Mark Twain's dead.
[02:46:08.037 --> 02:46:08.557]  Mark Twain's dead.
[02:46:08.957 --> 02:46:10.837]  Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.
[02:46:11.258 --> 02:46:12.058]  Alex Jones is dead.
[02:46:12.298 --> 02:46:13.318]  Alex Jones is discredited.
[02:46:13.598 --> 02:46:14.539]  Alex Jones, it's all over.
[02:46:14.719 --> 02:46:15.599]  Paul, we go straight up.
[02:46:17.316 --> 02:46:18.777]  They celebrate themselves.
[02:46:18.797 --> 02:46:20.057]  They're a bunch of con artists.
[02:46:21.718 --> 02:46:27.961]  So anyways, Sheriff David Clark defends appearance on conspiracy-laden show.
[02:46:28.421 --> 02:46:36.925]  Oh see, and I love how the sheriff says, oh, I didn't know I had to talk to you to be allowed to have an opinion or review.
[02:46:36.945 --> 02:46:42.268]  Let me read from the InfoWars.com story that's got the quote saying, go read the full article.
[02:46:43.868 --> 02:46:46.490]  Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark Jr.
[02:46:46.530 --> 02:46:57.736]  has defended his comments on the Alex Jones Show earlier this week under criticism from local reporters who said his remarks that strict gun legislation could lead to a second American Revolution were inflammatory.
[02:46:57.896 --> 02:46:59.437]  Trying to take our guns is inflammatory.
[02:46:59.537 --> 02:47:01.439]  Trying to blame us for dead kids is inflammatory.
[02:47:01.459 --> 02:47:03.560]  It's like somebody ran somebody over with a tractor.
[02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:05.401]  Are you going to take all the John Deere tractors away?
[02:47:05.821 --> 02:47:06.842]  No, the tractor didn't do it.
[02:47:08.499 --> 02:47:14.185]  Clark told Jones listeners that he would consider any federal order to confiscate guns as an act of tyranny.
[02:47:14.585 --> 02:47:16.707]  He also said, I don't want to get shot, he's not stupid.
[02:47:17.328 --> 02:47:20.431]  And said that he would refuse to enforce it in the county.
[02:47:21.687 --> 02:47:24.169]  You don't like this, do you, that we're now having this discussion, do you?
[02:47:24.189 --> 02:47:27.832]  See, we win, we force the initiative, we go on the offense and make you respond to us.
[02:47:28.112 --> 02:47:30.333]  You don't control reality anymore, you viper!
[02:47:31.114 --> 02:47:31.694]  Let's continue.
[02:47:32.175 --> 02:47:39.960]  I believe that if somebody tried to enforce something of that magnitude, you would see the second coming of an American revolution.
[02:47:40.461 --> 02:47:45.805]  The likes of which would make the first revolution pale with comparison, the sheriff urged.
[02:47:46.983 --> 02:48:00.106]  That comment did not sit well with hacks at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, who accused Clark of engaging in attention-grabbing media appearances on a conspiracy-peddling radio show.
[02:48:01.566 --> 02:48:08.147]  In a piece which we'll not link to, clearly designed to draw some much-needed readership from Infowars' audience.
[02:48:09.208 --> 02:48:09.908]  Oh, be nice!
[02:48:10.128 --> 02:48:11.608]  Call Steve up and have him link to that.
[02:48:12.248 --> 02:48:15.129]  I think it's comical to see him burning in flames politically.
[02:48:16.050 --> 02:48:29.511]  In a piece designed to draw some much-needed readership from InfoWars' audience, one reporter makes several baiting remarks about Alex Jones while extensively quoting from our article on Sheriff Clark's comments earlier this week.
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:32.321]  See, it's the mainstream media that never links.
[02:48:32.801 --> 02:48:33.601]  We will links.
[02:48:33.681 --> 02:48:36.722]  I know why Steve did that, but it's a way to point that out.
[02:48:36.763 --> 02:48:39.544]  I get it's a literary flourish, but let's link to them.
[02:48:40.244 --> 02:48:42.525]  We don't know how long their publication will be around anyways.
[02:48:42.985 --> 02:48:50.608]  When the Sentinel reporter questioned Clark's appearance in his comments, the sheriff responded in an email stating, I don't know, I needed your approval.
[02:48:50.628 --> 02:48:51.509]  I love that.
[02:48:51.529 --> 02:48:53.469]  Because they're like, why are you on the show?
[02:48:53.489 --> 02:48:55.610]  Well, I didn't know I needed your approval.
[02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:58.311]  When did people stop being entitled to their opinion?
[02:48:58.752 --> 02:48:59.332]  Asked the sheriff.
[02:49:00.532 --> 02:49:09.918]  On the topic of the second revolution, Commons Clark told the newspaper, I'm sure in 1776 the idea seemed way out there, too, at the time.
[02:49:09.938 --> 02:49:11.438]  Now what a smart guy, man.
[02:49:11.478 --> 02:49:12.939]  I really like these sheriffs.
[02:49:13.380 --> 02:49:15.541]  These patriot sheriffs are like, all need talk shows.
[02:49:16.021 --> 02:49:20.544]  The sheriff wrote, the American people will decide when to push back, not me.
[02:49:21.084 --> 02:49:22.025]  That's right.
[02:49:22.665 --> 02:49:23.125]  That's right.
[02:49:23.245 --> 02:49:26.587]  You've been pushing on us long enough, New World Order.
[02:49:26.927 --> 02:49:28.668]  And we're sick of being pushed around.
[02:49:28.869 --> 02:49:35.012]  I don't care how many sitcoms, how many dramas, how many shows you've got demonizing red-blooded good people.
[02:49:35.292 --> 02:49:37.574]  Or how many times you say we killed the kids at Sandy Hook.
[02:49:37.754 --> 02:49:41.456]  Or how many times CNN says I supported Chris Storner when everybody knows I didn't.
[02:49:41.696 --> 02:49:43.537]  Or how many times you say the U.S.
[02:49:43.577 --> 02:49:44.818]  attacked Russia that I said that.
[02:49:44.838 --> 02:49:46.519]  I didn't say that.
[02:49:46.619 --> 02:49:48.220]  You are discredited.
[02:49:49.266 --> 02:49:51.607]  Call me a conspiracy theorist because I know all your tricks.
[02:49:52.528 --> 02:49:53.048]  Call me that.
[02:49:53.148 --> 02:49:53.669]  Call me that.
[02:49:53.729 --> 02:49:54.189]  Call me that.
[02:49:54.429 --> 02:49:55.610]  Keep calling me that all day.
[02:49:56.530 --> 02:49:56.950]  I love it.
[02:49:57.671 --> 02:49:58.752]  That's the only trick you got.
[02:49:59.552 --> 02:50:00.352]  People are a joke.
[02:50:02.374 --> 02:50:04.655]  I was interviewed by CNN poster Piers Morgan.
[02:50:04.675 --> 02:50:06.736]  Now there's a guy with some whacked out views.
[02:50:06.796 --> 02:50:07.877]  Clark also wrote an email.
[02:50:09.201 --> 02:50:13.344]  I've done dozens of interviews over the simple 30-second radio ad Clark told the Journal Sentinel.
[02:50:13.564 --> 02:50:26.134]  And folks, if the crime rate is going up in Milwaukee because of police being laid off, and because they got gun control going on there, and he wants to keep the county safe, what do you say?
[02:50:26.154 --> 02:50:28.015]  You say, folks, time to get firearms ready and protect yourself.
[02:50:28.035 --> 02:50:29.236]  I mean, that is a no-brainer.
[02:50:29.456 --> 02:50:30.617]  That should not be radical.
[02:50:30.637 --> 02:50:31.397]  That is common sense.
[02:50:31.598 --> 02:50:32.798]  But they want to tell us we're radical.
[02:50:32.818 --> 02:50:37.102]  I mean, we've had people march up to us on the streets of Austin and say, you've got too many kids.
[02:50:38.447 --> 02:50:39.368]  It's happened in Whole Foods.
[02:50:39.388 --> 02:50:41.370]  It's like, listen, you're a radical jackass.
[02:50:41.590 --> 02:50:42.531]  Get out of my face.
[02:50:43.552 --> 02:50:45.555]  You sick freak cult member.
[02:50:45.895 --> 02:50:47.296]  You eugenics punk.
[02:50:48.117 --> 02:50:49.338]  Well, there are too many people.
[02:50:49.499 --> 02:50:51.681]  Then go home and blow your brains out.
[02:50:51.741 --> 02:50:52.462]  Oh, you don't do that.
[02:50:52.622 --> 02:50:54.164]  Go home and take a bunch of pills.
[02:50:54.464 --> 02:50:58.288]  You eugenics loving pieces of filth.
[02:50:58.348 --> 02:50:59.609]  Get out of my planet.
[02:51:00.979 --> 02:51:02.600]  Introducing Pro-1.

[02:51:11.046 --> 02:51:17.050]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:51:17.170 --> 02:51:27.978]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.

[02:51:49.594 --> 02:51:51.617]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:52:09.658 --> 02:52:11.379]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:13.020]  Police call it robbery.
[02:52:13.621 --> 02:52:14.982]  We call it avoidable.

[02:54:16.696 --> 02:54:24.819]  This planet belongs to people that want to build a better civilization and have a great future for our progeny who love life.
[02:54:24.899 --> 02:54:38.204]  And all of you that say it's your planet, you're protecting it by trying to reduce the population and trying to save the Earth, you're the people with all the open-air genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, all the super science experiments you're doing that may destroy the planet.
[02:54:38.544 --> 02:54:40.446]  I've studied it, and you're the danger.
[02:54:40.766 --> 02:54:52.175]  Now this is from like five years ago, almost six years ago, a News Corp internal promo video bragging to their people how they're propagandizing everybody.
[02:54:52.895 --> 02:54:56.218]  So the public understands, folks, everything you see
[02:54:57.751 --> 02:54:58.691]  Around 90% of it.
[02:54:58.992 --> 02:55:04.114]  There are some shows that are independently authorized to go out and still those get taken over and twisted.
[02:55:04.654 --> 02:55:05.755]  Because I've been involved with them.
[02:55:06.375 --> 02:55:08.276]  Conspiracy, things like that.
[02:55:08.296 --> 02:55:09.477]  Conspiracy theory with Ventura.
[02:55:10.758 --> 02:55:12.859]  And if something's good, they just won't let it air.
[02:55:13.439 --> 02:55:19.321]  So it's hard to get something good on air, but certainly most of it is paid for, New World Order trash.
[02:55:19.841 --> 02:55:28.664]  And here they are on the environmental front to scare everybody into global carbon taxes to fund the world government that's being openly announced again today.
[02:55:29.164 --> 02:55:31.865]  Here is News Corp, the folks demonizing the Tea Party.
[02:55:33.050 --> 02:55:43.519]  One host will be, oh, the Tea Party's good, the other, no, they're bad, and then they'll laugh about, oh, look, Jack Swaggart, you know, is saying the Tea Party's racist, ah-ha-ha-ha, and then just make it a joke.
[02:55:44.680 --> 02:55:46.342]  They're loyal opposition, here's that clip.
[02:55:46.362 --> 02:55:56.391]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[02:55:56.811 --> 02:55:57.832]  That's April on record.
[02:55:58.851 --> 02:55:59.631]  Global warming.
[02:55:59.931 --> 02:56:00.452]  Probably.
[02:56:00.752 --> 02:56:04.973]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[02:56:07.034 --> 02:56:09.315]  Three years is a long ways away.
[02:56:09.715 --> 02:56:13.897]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[02:56:14.097 --> 02:56:14.457]  To pay.
[02:56:14.737 --> 02:56:15.598]  Just had another thought.
[02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:17.421]  Megabags 1.
[02:56:17.501 --> 02:56:20.082]  The Scared Straight Show had a green message too.
[02:56:20.302 --> 02:56:28.206]  The biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into some of our content.
[02:56:28.226 --> 02:56:29.047]  I don't follow.
[02:56:29.747 --> 02:56:31.988]  Green, it means environmentally friendly.
[02:56:32.128 --> 02:56:39.472]  The lifeblood of our company is the quality of our TV shows and we would accomplish nothing if we compromised that quality.
[02:56:39.572 --> 02:56:40.233]  Going green.
[02:56:41.013 --> 02:56:42.534]  Doesn't fit with the rest of the show.
[02:56:43.074 --> 02:56:44.394]  We're working magic, make it fit.
[02:56:44.635 --> 02:56:45.175]  Hey Brian!
[02:56:45.455 --> 02:56:48.496]  I'm not gonna recycle this aluminum can, I'm just gonna throw it in the trash!
[02:56:50.477 --> 02:56:50.737]  Ha!
[02:56:51.097 --> 02:56:52.878]  You're Earth's bitch!
[02:56:52.898 --> 02:57:10.105]  The most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production, as well as work in a message about global warming, about environmental changes, and about

[02:57:18.848 --> 02:57:26.351]  But your entries are going to be featured on Infowars.com, on our YouTube channel, on the Nightly News.
[02:57:26.391 --> 02:57:27.372]  So it's a film festival.
[02:57:28.072 --> 02:57:31.273]  I mean, this is the equivalent of the Cannes Film Festival or something.
[02:57:31.333 --> 02:57:31.933]  It's so big.
[02:57:32.513 --> 02:57:33.894]  It will get media attention.
[02:57:35.074 --> 02:57:38.975]  Make a film about liberty and fighting tyranny, fiction, non-fiction, whatever.
[02:57:39.275 --> 02:57:41.716]  You can win $115,000, three prizes, $100,000, $10,000, $5,000.

[02:58:05.254 --> 02:58:07.397]  And it's also for people to follow the rules.
[02:58:07.417 --> 02:58:10.281]  We've got a lot of great entries, but most of them don't follow the basic rules.
[02:58:10.902 --> 02:58:12.303]  That you can figure out.
[02:58:13.263 --> 02:58:15.424]  Of course, we'll get the very best entries right up.
[02:58:16.004 --> 02:58:17.885]  We've got two more months.

[02:58:21.346 --> 02:58:24.148]  I have two months to judge them, play them on air, play clips.
[02:58:25.108 --> 02:58:26.309]  And it's going to be very, very exciting.
[02:58:26.349 --> 02:58:27.309]  So be a big part of that.
[02:58:27.669 --> 02:58:30.470]  InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:33.091]  InfoWars.com forward slash contest.

[02:58:36.093 --> 02:58:36.873]  I am judging it.
[02:58:37.293 --> 02:58:39.074]  But I'll also take the viewers' feedback.

[02:58:58.971 --> 02:59:06.157]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
