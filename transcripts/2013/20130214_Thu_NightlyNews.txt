[00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:03.288]  We're good.
[00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.176]  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.297]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:42.740]  Tonight is Thursday, February 14th, 2013, V-Day.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.401]  And I'm your host, Aaron Dyches.
[00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:49.504]  Now, tonight in the news we have, of course, the aftermath of the Christopher Dorner episode.
[00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:53.387]  It ended in spectacular abandon for due process.
[00:00:53.787 --> 00:01:06.510]  Spectacular incitement of divisions in our society, with many people cheering on the factions warring against the LAPD, while others cheering on the extrajudicial killing of Christopher Dorner.
[00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:21.073]  Of course, Breitbart and Drudge Report exposed how many of the CNN panel hosts cheered it and celebrated, said it was exciting like a Denzel Washington movie, and compared Dorner to Django Unchained going on a killing spree.
[00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:33.083]  Meanwhile, Melissa Melton wrote yesterday about the three wallets with ID cards that were reportedly recovered, all belonging to Christopher Dorner, which raised their own questions.
[00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:41.310]  One of them was allegedly found, of course, at the Big Bear cabin, apparently not scorched by the fires set by police and sheriffs there.
[00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.453]  Yet, two other IDs were found in southern parts of California.
[00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:51.115]  One by a stadium in San Diego and another at the border crossing point.
[00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:53.556]  And so, which wallet is the real one?
[00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:54.677]  Are any of them real?
[00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:57.158]  Do the media have any grasp on the facts?
[00:01:57.278 --> 00:02:03.682]  And do these raise further questions the way the passports allegedly recovered from the 9-11 hijackers do?
[00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:05.603]  About the veracity of 9-11.
[00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:16.413]  And of course you got the police wantonly firing upon innocent civilians, endangering their lives recklessly, pursuing this one man they couldn't catch for days, nearly a week.
[00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:19.776]  But of course the biggest questions of all over Christopher Dorner.
[00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:26.136]  are raised over the ludicrous claims that the cabin fire was not intentionally set.
[00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:49.314]  Paul Joseph Watson writes about the denial on behalf of the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office specifically stating that it was not set on purpose saying we didn't intentionally burn that cabin to get Mr. Dorner out and they just went on to deny it and defer questions from the press and duck other questions about whether they offered him a chance to surrender or what name you despite the fact that
[00:02:49.714 --> 00:03:01.645]  Audio was broadcast live on many of these local stations, exist in the police recordings, talking about burn that MFR down, talking about the CS gas they were throwing in there, talking about how the burners are deployed.
[00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:02.887]  We have the fire ready.
[00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:07.691]  Now we have clips summing up some of this audio and of course the ridiculous denial.
[00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:08.412]  Can we go to that?
[00:03:08.452 --> 00:03:09.273]  Do we have that ready guys?
[00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:17.649]  We do believe this gun battle is going on with Christopher Dorner.
[00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.270]  He is armed and extremely dangerous.
[00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:23.111]  Well, we're not positive.
[00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:27.793]  And until we get this guy in custody, until he's in handcuffs and in a jail, we're not going to know for sure.
[00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:34.655]  We believe suspect Dorner began firing and ambushed our deputy sheriffs that were responding.
[00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:39.716]  Two of our deputy sheriffs were struck by gunfire.
[00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:43.878]  Certainly it could be anywhere at this point, and that's why we're searching door to door.
[00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:50.241]  We spoke to individuals in that neighborhood who said that no one ever knocked on their doors.
[00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:51.121]  People who live there.
[00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.742]  As I said, there was an extensive search in that area.
[00:03:53.882 --> 00:03:54.683]  Burn the gas.
[00:03:55.063 --> 00:03:55.904]  Burn the gas.
[00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:57.004]  Burn the gas.
[00:03:57.064 --> 00:03:57.825]  Hey, hold it.
[00:03:57.885 --> 00:03:58.285]  Hold it.
[00:03:58.586 --> 00:03:59.026]  Get out.
[00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:00.707]  Get the F out.
[00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:07.993]  Is anyone founded if they think that this was an intentional burning alive of the suspect?
[00:04:08.513 --> 00:04:13.017]  I don't know, you know, really how to respond to the recording.
[00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:29.729]  They have not been able to determine who started the fire inside the cabin, whether it was the suspect, presumably Dorner, or if it was perhaps one of the things that the SWAT team out there had planned in advance of this.
[00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.211]  I can tell you that it was not on purpose.
[00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.752]  We did not intentionally burn down that cabin.
[00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:38.074]  Jeff, we're just bringing fire in about 200 yards out.
[00:04:38.234 --> 00:04:38.654]  Your call.
[00:04:39.575 --> 00:04:41.276]  Charlie, you ready for fire?
[00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:50.126]  The next tier gas was that that was pyrotechnic.
[00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:53.267]  It does generate a lot of heat.
[00:04:53.847 --> 00:04:56.828]  We introduced those canisters into the residence.
[00:04:57.488 --> 00:05:02.189]  The pyrotechnic type canisters are commonly referred to as burners.
[00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:32.724]  And so there you have it, the government, aspects of the government, again engaged in a Waco style burning down of a suspect, demonizing him and the press, burning and killing him.
[00:05:32.764 --> 00:05:37.687]  We'll never know if he was really guilty of all these crimes because of course there won't be a real investigation.
[00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.507]  It's just this public trial.
[00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:41.868]  But then the denial, oh that was semantics.
[00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:44.308]  Burner, that didn't mean fire.
[00:05:44.648 --> 00:05:47.289]  Saying burn it down, that didn't mean burn it down.
[00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:49.689]  Fire, that just means they were excited.
[00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:52.170]  Gas, that's some kind of antiquated 60s term.
[00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.110]  It's a gas, baby!
[00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.951]  That was just the way SWAT people talk on the scene.
[00:05:55.991 --> 00:06:01.692]  It doesn't mean they meant to start a fire even though they started a fire and then it burned him down and allegedly killed him.
[00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:06.293]  Of course you saw also in that clip the former FBI assistant director
[00:06:06.713 --> 00:06:13.415]  Tom Fuentes, he was asked to explain why they were talking about burning it down if in fact they didn't mean to burn it down.
[00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:31.662]  He was at a loss to explain and said well there's a lot of questions to answer and he wouldn't expect these professional SWAT people to talk that way and then quickly shuffle on to how those conversations should have been on encrypted radio frequencies so the public couldn't hear them and raise questions about why things were burned down.
[00:06:32.162 --> 00:06:41.149]  Again, they burn him down on purpose because they do that over and over again, partially to sell you the message that the government's in charge and don't try to go against them.
[00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:51.536]  Of course, the things Dorner's accused of doing were horrible and he was very much a villain despite the portrayals of him as a hero because he has a manifesto and because the LAPD are, in fact, corrupt.
[00:06:51.777 --> 00:07:00.363]  Well, if the police would stop protecting police who do bad things, individuals, and protecting them through their police unions and making sure they never see justice,
[00:07:00.663 --> 00:07:02.645]  The public wouldn't be turned against the police.
[00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:10.751]  They could celebrate the police who are law-abiding, upholding of public safety, and they could just simply punish the police who are doing the wrong things.
[00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:20.778]  But instead, they have to gang up and defend the bad police and make them all bad by association, and then the public gets angry at them and cheers on an anti-hero like Dorner.
[00:07:20.798 --> 00:07:21.779]  It's just insane.
[00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:23.100]  Let's not do that, folks.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.821]  Let's just live by the law.
[00:07:25.482 --> 00:07:26.662]  Meanwhile, drones
[00:07:27.643 --> 00:07:42.220]  Dorner and the NDA Kurt Nemo sums up an article about how lobbyists for the drone industry from the Association for Unmanned Vehicles Systems International said things might have been a lot different if we had more drones in the sky if the FAA
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.100]  I don't think so.
[00:08:05.348 --> 00:08:08.010]  That comes on the heels of Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.193]  New surveillance system tracks every moving object in an entire city.
[00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:23.680]  They've got a state-of-the-art spy system housed in a drone that can hover at 20,000 feet and claims to be able to record every moving object in an entire city.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.942]  That's a DARPA project increasingly like Skynet.
[00:08:27.242 --> 00:08:27.602]  We're good to go.
[00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:59.424]  So again, they're using the Dorner event to hype up for more surveillance, more drones, while Missouri is calling for all-out gun confiscation.
[00:08:59.785 --> 00:09:06.190]  A new bill, House Bill 545, introduced by Democrats Rory Ellinger and Jill Shoup.
[00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:18.373]  Would ban the possession, the sale, the transfer, the manufacture of semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines and would make the holders of them in Missouri Class C felons.
[00:09:18.913 --> 00:09:30.396]  If this bill becomes law, it would give Missourians 90 days to either oust their illegitimate government, who's infringing on the Second Amendment, or to get rid of those weapons or be prosecuted and jailed.
[00:09:30.797 --> 00:09:32.357]  It's very similar to the kind of
[00:09:32.617 --> 00:09:32.997]  That's right.
[00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:56.019]  Has told us that they will combat terrorism.
[00:09:56.499 --> 00:09:57.881]  Oh, I'm sorry, I got ahead of myself.
[00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.103]  With the guns, we have a special report.
[00:10:00.464 --> 00:10:03.367]  Dan Bodondi is our Northeast correspondent.
[00:10:03.427 --> 00:10:10.675]  He interviewed Stuart Rhodes, attended a rally there in Rhode Island about how people there are rallying for their Second Amendment rights.
[00:10:10.695 --> 00:10:11.736]  Do we have the report ready?
[00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:37.450]  You know, the government is after our Second Amendment, and you've got Dianne Feinstein hell-bent on taking our arms away completely, and what they're doing is they're slowly incrementing, like taking, you know, limiting magazines to ten rounds, and what kind of ammo you can buy now, and all of a sudden assault weapons are going after them.
[00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.370]  What are your thoughts on that?
[00:10:39.377 --> 00:10:40.277]  I think it's ridiculous.
[00:10:40.797 --> 00:10:43.258]  I think if they want us to give up our guns, they should do it first.
[00:10:43.998 --> 00:10:45.919]  They should stop putting drones in our skies.
[00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:50.881]  They should stop saying they have the ability to arrest us in person in jail without trial or charge.
[00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:54.342]  They should stop listening to our phone calls without a warrant under the Patriot Act.
[00:10:54.722 --> 00:10:56.883]  And we should stop militarizing our police forces.
[00:10:57.463 --> 00:11:02.084]  And then if they did that, maybe I'd consider limiting guns, but I don't think so.
[00:11:02.124 --> 00:11:06.686]  The long line of Americans who have bled
[00:11:07.808 --> 00:11:20.712]  Died and bled for liberty stretches all the way back to Lexington Green and all the way forward to right now in the sands of Iraq and Afghanistan and here on the Pyramid.
[00:11:21.772 --> 00:11:25.714]  We let their sacrifice be in vain.
[00:11:26.114 --> 00:11:30.455]  Our children will curse our names for giving away their birthright for liberty.
[00:11:30.475 --> 00:11:36.577]  We'll desecrate the tombs of our fathers and our grandfathers and we will also
[00:11:40.904 --> 00:11:51.211]  In our Constitution, we have an amendment that recognizes that the government must always trust the people, and the people must never trust the government.
[00:11:51.251 --> 00:11:53.473]  And that, believe it or not, is the Second Amendment.
[00:11:53.553 --> 00:11:59.557]  It doesn't mention guns, it doesn't mention knives, it doesn't mention swords, it doesn't mention weapons at all.
[00:11:59.717 --> 00:12:03.140]  It just says keep and bear arms, and it's all about trust.
[00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:11.327]  And Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the famous Russian dissident, says that in the gulags, they look back and they realize their mistake.
[00:12:12.187 --> 00:12:30.953]  He said, how we burned into camps later, wondering what things would have been like if we had realized we had nothing to lose, and instead of peeling and tearing for the knock of a door in the middle of the night, we instead of an ambush down in the hall, using picks, pokers, axes, whatever was at hand,
[00:12:32.214 --> 00:12:39.117]  Well, you have a duty and responsibility to honor the Constitution and defend it against
[00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:51.083]  All in this foreign and domestic, and that means you have a duty and responsibility to protect the Bill of Rights, but beyond.
[00:12:51.123 --> 00:12:58.448]  You know, as General Smithy Butler said, the famous Marine Corps General, the only thing we're fighting for is your homes and the Bill of Rights.
[00:12:58.668 --> 00:13:02.151]  And so now it's the Bill of Rights on the chopping block, and you have a duty to step up.
[00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:08.700]  Now as you can see, folks, we've got tons of people here that are supporting the Second Amendment, braving the Northeastern we have here.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.448]  And the government's about to call a state of emergency, so we've got people here out supporting the Second Amendment.
[00:13:13.608 --> 00:13:14.489]  And thank you for watching.
[00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:16.712]  This is Gambit Gandhi for the InfoWars Lately News.
[00:13:21.064 --> 00:13:23.005]  And thank you, Dan Badani, for that report.
[00:13:23.045 --> 00:13:24.926]  So why are people talking about the Second Amendment?
[00:13:24.946 --> 00:13:29.387]  Well, we've talked about it so much over the past month and a half, two months, three months, you name it.
[00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:37.811]  But again, if you haven't seen the piece I did a few weeks ago, the founders intended us to have personal arms again and again and again.
[00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:41.532]  They have quotes showing us that in addition to the Second Amendment.
[00:13:41.853 --> 00:13:43.033]  But what is even that all about?
[00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:47.735]  Are we just arbitrarily holding ourselves to the words of some men from a couple hundred years ago?
[00:13:48.195 --> 00:14:01.685]  No, these are people who read history, who knew history, who are on the backs of the Enlightenment, who are playing off of why are there so many despotic princes and kings and priests and other arbitrary rulers ruling over our lives.
[00:14:01.985 --> 00:14:03.186]  Why does this keep happening?
[00:14:03.506 --> 00:14:09.650]  What can we do to limit the power of despots, to discourage tyrants, to discourage kings from running amok?
[00:14:09.951 --> 00:14:12.132]  What can we do to empower our own lives?
[00:14:12.432 --> 00:14:13.313]  That's what the Bill of
[00:14:13.533 --> 00:14:14.133]  We're good to go.
[00:14:41.707 --> 00:14:44.868]  More corrupt Obamas, if we ever let go of those arms.
[00:14:44.908 --> 00:14:47.528]  We need to keep them to stave off oppression.
[00:14:47.548 --> 00:14:48.369]  That's the whole point.
[00:14:48.729 --> 00:14:59.471]  Now, turning to the population issue, we've seen these globalists, the Council on Foreign Relations, you name them, again and again use any excuse to sell their eugenics oppression agenda.
[00:14:59.851 --> 00:15:09.874]  It is the same agenda as the top-down New World Order control system, where they have degraded, debased, and dehumiliated, dehumiliated not being a good choice of word,
[00:15:10.194 --> 00:15:17.120]  They have deprivated humankind, they have lessened, they have cheapened life, and they will use any excuse.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:32.652]  We see here where terrorism in Mali and in Africa is now being used as a population control excuse with a Chatham House, that is the Royal Institute of International Affairs, speaking in the Foreign Policy Journal, which is the Council on Foreign Relations journal,
[00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:46.799]  Two sister organizations about Mali's 2.5% problem going on to describe how in the aftermath of Algerian attacks and insurgency in Mali expect to hear an overwhelming silence about the population issue.
[00:15:47.099 --> 00:15:51.762]  The taboo continues to surround the issue of population control needs to be cast aside.
[00:15:52.202 --> 00:16:02.685]  New and highly drastic means of curbing the rate of growth have to be devised in order to put into practice if this dire threat to regional and international stability is ever to be averted.
[00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:14.769]  And so they just take anything and they tell us because there's tension in the Middle East we need to have greater population control and that will stop terrorists because they're just fomenting out of the lack of resources in their region.
[00:16:15.229 --> 00:16:18.553]  Actually, they already tried to push population control on the Middle East.
[00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:19.895]  They didn't accept it.
[00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:28.765]  And that not only stirred up the populations, it caused a lot of resentment that was later amplified by the ongoing wars throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa.
[00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:40.112]  Furthermore, it was an excuse for the West to implement central banks, to set up their own kingdoms, to implement systems they wanted to control those populations.
[00:16:40.513 --> 00:16:50.379]  And it's really related to the overall resistance, while the population control issue is just being pegged on by the elitist when they see any kind of incident going on in Africa.
[00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:58.344]  And then Uri Masan, who wrote this article, and has written many fine articles lately, goes on to say they're going to use this excuse for everything.
[00:16:58.764 --> 00:17:01.805]  The answer to drunk driving is culling the population.
[00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:07.067]  The answer to curing cancer is culling the population, so less people will die as a result of cancer.
[00:17:07.367 --> 00:17:19.230]  They've already used it for climate change, saying because of climate change, terrorism will be caused, so we are justified in having the bankers run off tens of thousands of people from their lands and handing it over to corporations.
[00:17:19.631 --> 00:17:21.151]  Yes, it's good for the Earth.
[00:17:21.611 --> 00:17:24.112]  It's good for stopping terrorism, yes.
[00:17:24.332 --> 00:17:25.753]  Anything to cull that population.
[00:17:26.173 --> 00:17:27.633]  Yeah, they'll use any excuse.
[00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:28.934]  I've been through it in detail.
[00:17:29.254 --> 00:17:30.755]  So have many other researchers.
[00:17:31.155 --> 00:17:36.317]  Now, Alex Jones with Paul Joseph Watson wrote, Why the Elite Would Lose a Civil War.
[00:17:36.337 --> 00:17:38.098]  It is a part two.
[00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:41.900]  In the part one, they explain why the elite are seeking a civil war.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.381]  Basically, it's a tactic of division.
[00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:49.683]  It's a tactic of weakening confidence in the American system, scaring away investors.
[00:17:50.303 --> 00:18:04.641]  And of course setting up the New World Order system, the bankers themselves as the saviors to basically seize upon civil unrest, broken down economy and everything else because they're the ones who institute order out of chaos of course.
[00:18:05.162 --> 00:18:22.368]  And outlining how really the system is showing us in so many ways through their amassing of bullets, through the continuity of government plan, through their homeland security occupation plan, how they want a war with Americans and how they're preparing for it and really trying to incite it over the course of the next five to ten years.
[00:18:22.748 --> 00:18:29.390]  We don't really know if that is the timeline, but of course they factor in comments like those of Al Sharpton recently who said,
[00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.932]  Americans, don't try to give me that nonsense about the Second Amendment.
[00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.473]  Your guns wouldn't do anything to stop drones.
[00:18:35.754 --> 00:18:43.178]  You're occupied by the American government already, so just give in and also shut up about that Second Amendment because you're ruled by drones.
[00:18:43.518 --> 00:18:51.583]  Well, history does not show that to be the case, and in spite of increasing technological diversionary tactics, of increased
[00:18:51.903 --> 00:18:52.684]  We're good to go.
[00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:20.224]  In Afghanistan, no empire has ever been able to defeat those mountain people.
[00:19:20.844 --> 00:19:34.408]  Not necessarily the Taliban, those who are actually engaged in some form of terrorism, but the whole of the people who said they don't want to be occupied by any empire, and that they know the land, and that as long as they resist, basically we've been unable to defeat them.
[00:19:34.768 --> 00:19:43.690]  Even though their numbers are maybe 25,000 at the most, and we have hundreds of thousands of troops in those countries and in the general area, we have superior weapons,
[00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.772]  Doesn't really matter as long as there's a true spirit of resistance there.
[00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:19.336]  Also, a people who cannot be conquered through spirit, because you can always find a way to resist.
[00:20:19.737 --> 00:20:33.733]  Even if you are disarmed, there's ways to destabilize the enemy, and once you have victories, if they're moral victories, those amplify, those resonate with the people, and the sympathy starts to turn back towards the rightful people, if right is on your side.
[00:20:34.758 --> 00:20:35.998]  But where did that even come from?
[00:20:36.018 --> 00:20:45.960]  I want to read you this from 1765, because the colonial Americans who later fought a war against the British did have the spirit of independence in many ways.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.461]  They did have the spirit to resist and to simply say no.
[00:20:49.941 --> 00:20:53.142]  And some people actually saw it coming, even on the British side.
[00:20:53.442 --> 00:20:56.122]  These are going to be the remarks of Colonel Isaac Barre.
[00:20:56.463 --> 00:21:03.284]  Now, he served in the French and Indian War, you know, in the years preceding the American Revolution and the build-up to it.
[00:21:03.584 --> 00:21:05.846]  He served alongside those American patriots.
[00:21:05.886 --> 00:21:06.626]  He knew them well.
[00:21:06.987 --> 00:21:09.148]  He was friends with many in the merchant class.
[00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:13.092]  And he defended them in front of Parliament, as a member of Parliament.
[00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:16.354]  Basically a minority, not of one, but of just a couple.
[00:21:16.815 --> 00:21:22.639]  Almost the only individual speaking out against the Stamp Act, passed against the colonies in 1765.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.102]  And this is really a, you didn't build that speech.
[00:21:26.182 --> 00:21:27.964]  Today we have Obama saying,
[00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:29.704]  The government's your daddy.
[00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:32.946]  We have Chris Rock saying Obama is the country's daddy.
[00:21:33.006 --> 00:21:35.327]  He's not only president, but he's also your daddy.
[00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:36.367]  He made it happen.
[00:21:36.407 --> 00:21:40.649]  We've got Obama giving the speeches saying you didn't build that small businesses.
[00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:41.950]  The government helped you.
[00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.250]  Somebody helped you with that.
[00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.852]  Basically saying the government is the provider and whatever they don't give you, you don't have.
[00:21:48.232 --> 00:21:53.074]  That same kind of attitude came from the British in those founding days of America.
[00:21:53.534 --> 00:21:56.155]  And again, Colonel Isaac Barry spoke against it.
[00:21:56.435 --> 00:22:00.416]  Consider that you didn't build that approach, as he tells you what real Americans were made of.
[00:22:00.757 --> 00:22:02.377]  And they weren't always non-violent.
[00:22:02.417 --> 00:22:04.138]  They weren't always sympathetic.
[00:22:04.378 --> 00:22:05.818]  They didn't always do the right thing.
[00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:07.899]  In fact, many of them didn't agree with each other.
[00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:10.080]  And yet they had the spirit of resistance.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:18.751]  They sought to moral victories where they could find them, and there eventually was a momentum that built in their favor, leading to the ultimate victories.
[00:22:19.031 --> 00:22:24.759]  Now here again, 1765, opposition to the Stamp Act being imposed on colonial America.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.641]  They, planted by your care,
[00:22:27.242 --> 00:22:29.703]  No, your oppressions planted them in America.
[00:22:30.163 --> 00:22:35.405]  They fled from your tyranny to a then uncultivated and unhospitable country.
[00:22:35.925 --> 00:22:48.009]  And yet, actuated by principles of true English liberty, they met all these hardships with pleasure, Colonel Isaac Berry said, compared with those they suffered with their own country.
[00:22:48.989 --> 00:22:52.530]  They nourished up by your indulgence, he asked rhetorically?
[00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.631]  No, they grew by your neglect of them.
[00:22:55.912 --> 00:23:02.094]  And as soon as you began to care about them, that care was exercised in sending persons to rule over them.
[00:23:02.554 --> 00:23:12.918]  In one department or another, who were perhaps the deputies of deputies of some members of this house, sent to spy on their liberty, to misrepresent their actions, to prey upon them.
[00:23:13.318 --> 00:23:16.839]  Men whose behavior on many occasions caused the blood
[00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:17.439]  I'm
[00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:37.699]  We're good to go.
[00:23:52.248 --> 00:24:03.902]  The people, I believe, are as truly loyal as any subjects to the king, but a people who are jealous of their liberties and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated.
[00:24:04.162 --> 00:24:07.286]  But the subject is too delicate and I will say no more.
[00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:10.590]  He predicted so much of what would happen in the American Revolution
[00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:17.573]  At the time of the Stamp Act, opposing the Stamp Act, telling the King, telling the Parliament, no, these are sons of liberty.
[00:24:17.613 --> 00:24:25.638]  These people have the spirit of freedom in them, and your oppression is only going to backfire, it's going to cause resentment in them, and it's going to give them moral victories.
[00:24:25.938 --> 00:24:27.278]  What did Colonial America do?
[00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:28.939]  They said no to the Stamp Act.
[00:24:28.959 --> 00:24:32.501]  They intimidated the tax collectors who were meant to impose that Act.
[00:24:32.741 --> 00:24:33.922]  They burned them in effigy.
[00:24:34.242 --> 00:24:39.585]  They sent mobs, basically, to say, if you collect those taxes, it's your last day in this colony.
[00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:49.634]  That first started in Massachusetts, it spread very quickly to Virginia, then to at least nine of the other colonies, and the Stamp Act was repealed in Britain.
[00:24:50.114 --> 00:24:56.500]  They didn't know why, but they eventually caved in because they could see it wasn't going to do them any good, and people like Colonel Bari were right.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.823]  That spirit of resistance was going to weaken the British position.
[00:25:00.043 --> 00:25:00.463]  I don't know.
[00:25:22.597 --> 00:25:27.742]  And they asked, were the Americans loyal to the King and to the British system prior to the Stamp Act?
[00:25:28.042 --> 00:25:29.244]  Yes, they were, he said.
[00:25:29.524 --> 00:25:30.705]  But now, they're not.
[00:25:30.765 --> 00:25:34.689]  They've turned against the King, and now they're agitated, they're upset.
[00:25:35.049 --> 00:25:42.416]  And they went on to ask Benjamin Franklin, if we just lessen the duties of the tax, if we just back off a little, will they comply?
[00:25:42.737 --> 00:25:43.658]  Will they submit?
[00:25:44.378 --> 00:25:49.239]  No, Benjamin Franklin said, those American colonists will never submit.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.220]  And that's really the spirit of freedom.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:26:04.464]  As long as some people retain that spirit of freedom, they'll never be beaten by any oppression, maybe temporarily, but in the long run, never beaten by any oppression, no matter how strong the force, as long as people keep that spirit of alive.
[00:26:04.744 --> 00:26:06.504]  And of course, we don't want to see a civil war.
[00:26:06.564 --> 00:26:07.924]  We want to say no to all that.
[00:26:08.205 --> 00:26:09.145]  We don't want violence.
[00:26:09.205 --> 00:26:13.046]  We want to tell the system ahead of time that it's going to be a failure for them.
[00:26:13.888 --> 00:26:14.128]  Uh-huh.
[00:26:14.628 --> 00:26:14.848]  Uh-huh.
[00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:16.729]  Because of the spirit of victory.
[00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:19.370]  Let's move now to a much lighter subject.
[00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.632]  Alex and crew visited a Buc-ee's gas station.
[00:26:22.972 --> 00:26:25.673]  Really some of the biggest gas stations in the entire country.
[00:26:26.033 --> 00:26:26.313]  Why?
[00:26:26.373 --> 00:26:30.895]  Because they agreed to clean their bathrooms and now they're expanding into a complete empire.
[00:26:30.915 --> 00:26:32.436]  Let's go to that piece now, kind of humorous.
[00:26:35.603 --> 00:26:40.526]  Alright, we're back from confronting Piers Morgan and taking over his transmission.
[00:26:40.707 --> 00:26:45.450]  And Aaron Dykes was telling me, this was started by one of Ron Paul's friends in Texas, down by Houston.
[00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.791]  It's now taking over the whole country.
[00:26:46.811 --> 00:26:48.732]  You see them all over the place when we're on road trips.
[00:26:48.932 --> 00:26:53.315]  Buckies all worship the buck-toothed creature.
[00:26:53.956 --> 00:26:59.480]  And the reason they say these are taking over all of the truck stops and gas stations is they will clean the bathrooms.
[00:27:00.839 --> 00:27:01.820]  I mean this place is huge.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:10.748]  I don't think Rob, when I pulled up that game of Justice, maybe you should take this and give him a wide shot of just how big it is and go visit the legendary toilets.
[00:27:11.109 --> 00:27:14.812]  There's all the way down and it goes that way just as far.
[00:27:14.832 --> 00:27:17.655]  Oh my god it's Sha'Carri Jackson right there.
[00:27:17.795 --> 00:27:18.516]  Oh there he is.
[00:27:18.776 --> 00:27:22.920]  He hangs out at Buc-ee's too.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.261]  There's the giant mecca.
[00:27:24.401 --> 00:27:25.142]  Look they even got a tent.
[00:27:25.162 --> 00:27:26.163]  They have a tent in there.
[00:27:27.614 --> 00:27:29.215]  I think the whole point is this is over the top.
[00:27:29.255 --> 00:27:30.476]  I mean, do you think it's ever actually?
[00:27:30.496 --> 00:27:32.158]  This is in Bastrop, not that big of a town.
[00:27:32.178 --> 00:27:34.440]  I mean, there's like, how many ice machines?
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:34.580]  Like 15?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.220]  Like 20 of them.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.382]  Look, and then they're over here too.
[00:27:37.862 --> 00:27:39.103]  Oh my god, there's more!
[00:27:39.123 --> 00:27:41.866]  Now we're on the inside, gentlemen.
[00:27:42.847 --> 00:27:44.788]  Incredible.
[00:27:45.569 --> 00:27:47.851]  And then look.
[00:27:48.551 --> 00:27:49.992]  And again, this is only one part of the store.
[00:27:50.012 --> 00:27:51.474]  It goes around on each side over there.
[00:27:54.093 --> 00:27:54.733]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:27:54.793 --> 00:27:56.654]  I really think we're completely out of control.
[00:27:56.714 --> 00:28:01.295]  This is going to be... Yeah, let's just go see how powerful these are.
[00:28:01.395 --> 00:28:02.955]  I've driven by these and never gone in one.
[00:28:02.975 --> 00:28:05.056]  They're proliferating everywhere.
[00:28:05.076 --> 00:28:11.297]  It's kind of cultic.
[00:28:13.137 --> 00:28:15.458]  I think it's good robots that are going to take over from here, but...
[00:28:21.459 --> 00:28:22.920]  You've been drinking and driving, boy.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.980]  You look a little strange.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.422]  Same as those old movies where the eyes are looking at you through the painting?
[00:28:28.442 --> 00:28:30.883]  You can't hang a man for eating turkey, can you?
[00:28:31.203 --> 00:28:34.665]  Well, I think we can send him to get over that, boy.
[00:28:34.705 --> 00:28:36.686]  How you doing today?
[00:28:37.786 --> 00:28:39.447]  Maybe I did the voice for you, huh?
[00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:42.429]  That's a big secret.
[00:28:42.469 --> 00:28:44.389]  Got a hankering for a turkey leg?
[00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.651]  What's wrong with that, Bucky, huh?
[00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:48.812]  Bucky has his own line of things.
[00:28:48.892 --> 00:28:49.472]  Oh, you know.
[00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:51.089]  They're patriots now.
[00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:53.430]  Look, Mama, I'm getting one of these.
[00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.971]  That's it.
[00:28:55.792 --> 00:28:57.993]  This is not product placement for Buc-ee's.
[00:28:59.314 --> 00:28:59.995]  Oh my God.
[00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:02.200]  My wife is going to love this.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.102]  It's a little struggle pillow, isn't it?
[00:29:04.883 --> 00:29:07.025]  Alex, do you like Piers Morgan?
[00:29:07.465 --> 00:29:10.488]  Now that you know you want to turn your guns in, it's for the kids.
[00:29:10.628 --> 00:29:14.832]  It's not like a murdering empire's hijacked America that slaughters millions wherever they want.
[00:29:15.192 --> 00:29:16.693]  No, they really care about 20 kids.
[00:29:17.114 --> 00:29:18.115]  That's right, Alex.
[00:29:18.435 --> 00:29:19.036]  Turn them in.
[00:29:19.416 --> 00:29:20.417]  They're not going to take anything.
[00:29:20.477 --> 00:29:22.619]  Sure, they're taking the pension funds and stuff right now.
[00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:28.845]  Sure, the government ships narcotics in, but they really want the guns, because they want to help you.
[00:29:29.525 --> 00:29:31.346]  They want to take care of your guns for you.
[00:29:31.386 --> 00:29:32.826]  Come on, you like the kids.
[00:29:32.926 --> 00:29:33.627]  I'm Bucky.
[00:29:33.647 --> 00:29:35.067]  Notice I'm wearing a red cap.
[00:29:36.068 --> 00:29:39.809]  You know, Stalin was nice, and Mao's right, only the government needs the guns.
[00:29:40.689 --> 00:29:41.870]  And I like Piers Morgan.
[00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.110]  Have you heard Bucky do a great attack yet?
[00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:51.373]  Hello, I'm Piers Morgan, and I'm an elitist snob, and I have bodyguards, but you won't be having any firearms.
[00:29:52.274 --> 00:29:58.281]  And of course the rest of that piece is up at U2, but just having some fun on the way back from that Piers Morgan event.
[00:29:58.581 --> 00:30:01.224]  Gotta have some fun along the way too, even with Alex and crew.
[00:30:01.464 --> 00:30:03.226]  We'll turn now to the Daily Quote.
[00:30:03.607 --> 00:30:05.228]  It comes from George H.W.
[00:30:05.288 --> 00:30:06.029]  Bush during...
[00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:14.659]  Also, former President Gerald Ford's funeral, who was an admitted FBI plant inside the Warren Commission, but George H.W.
[00:30:14.699 --> 00:30:24.771]  Bush told the people during that funeral, during the eulogy, that conspiracy theorists can say what they will, but the Warren Commission report will always have the final, definitive say.
[00:30:25.171 --> 00:30:26.232]  On this tragic matter.
[00:30:26.352 --> 00:30:26.672]  Why?
[00:30:27.073 --> 00:30:28.894]  Because Jerry Ford put his name on it.
[00:30:28.914 --> 00:30:31.816]  And Jerry Ford's word was always good.
[00:30:31.836 --> 00:30:34.998]  Ladies and gentlemen, never doubt the word of Gerald Ford.
[00:30:35.038 --> 00:30:36.660]  We'll be back again tomorrow.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.600]  Have a good evening.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.761]  Have a good V-Day.
[00:30:38.861 --> 00:30:39.602]  Thanks for watching.
[00:30:39.642 --> 00:30:40.282]  Spread the word.
[00:30:40.643 --> 00:30:42.964]  Subscribe at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:30:43.245 --> 00:30:45.566]  Spread the word through PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:30:45.606 --> 00:30:47.368]  And never stop fighting that info war.
[00:30:47.668 --> 00:30:50.730]  It's not too late to turn things back around to the spirit of America.
[00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.790]  Of 1776.
[00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:51.130]  Of 1765.
[00:30:54.796 --> 00:30:55.751]  Good night, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:23.761]  InfoWars.com is proud to introduce the new InfoWars skateboards by Alien Workshop.
[00:31:24.321 --> 00:31:26.322]  Skaters have always been against the grain socially.
[00:31:26.602 --> 00:31:27.963]  Now wake up your friends politically.
[00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:29.904]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:30.204 --> 00:31:31.945]  We have Divide and Conquer or Brainwashing.
[00:31:32.385 --> 00:31:37.848]  Then take your deck to your local skate shop, pick out your own trucks, your own wheels, and then hit the streets and wake some people up.
[00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:40.009]  Here is legendary skateboarder Jake Nunn.
[00:31:40.429 --> 00:31:42.730]  This one has a lot more concave than I have on my board.
[00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:43.811]  And I like concave.
[00:31:44.151 --> 00:31:45.992]  It makes it easier to turn and feel the board.
[00:31:46.792 --> 00:31:47.272]  It's pretty cool.
[00:31:47.312 --> 00:31:48.713]  I mean, it's almost the same shape as mine.
[00:31:49.639 --> 00:31:51.340]  It's not really a sport, and it's not really art.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.661]  It's just kind of freedom, you know?
[00:31:53.962 --> 00:31:57.164]  I've listened to Alex Jones for a long time, and I love what InfoWars does.
[00:31:57.524 --> 00:31:58.945]  I've always loved Alien Workshop, too.
[00:31:59.205 --> 00:32:00.626]  I think it's kind of cool you guys got together.
[00:32:01.626 --> 00:32:02.407]  This one's pretty nice.
[00:32:03.868 --> 00:32:05.709]  Definitely one for the wall, one for the collection.
[00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:07.250]  Also good to skate.
[00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.672]  Get these limited edition decks at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:12.353 --> 00:32:12.993]  This is Jake Nunn.
[00:32:13.173 --> 00:32:16.335]  Get these beautiful new skateboards at InfoWars.com.
[00:32:16.855 --> 00:32:18.176]  Alien Workshop collaboration.
[00:32:18.476 --> 00:32:18.877]  Good stuff.
[00:32:19.844 --> 00:32:23.127]  ProPure is introducing ProOne.
[00:32:23.767 --> 00:32:27.911]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:32:28.651 --> 00:32:32.414]  This is the ProOne by ProPure.
[00:32:32.674 --> 00:32:33.895]  You wanted it, you got it.
[00:32:34.276 --> 00:32:39.200]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.144]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:32:47.046 --> 00:32:59.136]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:33:00.037 --> 00:33:03.299]  It cuts out the acid derivative of fluoride.
[00:33:03.619 --> 00:33:11.105]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:33:11.966 --> 00:33:30.644]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:33:31.204 --> 00:33:34.246]  This is a revolution against the tyrants.
[00:33:34.566 --> 00:33:40.128]  They love putting the toxic acid base of fluoride into your water.
[00:33:40.168 --> 00:33:47.552]  They love the fact that it's an adjuvant supercharging the trace Prozac in the water and the hormones and the other chemicals.
[00:33:48.072 --> 00:33:56.436]  By cutting out fluoride, you cut out the turbocharger in all the poison being artificially introduced into your body.
[00:33:57.136 --> 00:33:58.258]  This is what I use.
[00:33:58.739 --> 00:33:59.580]  It's a win-win.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.043]  You get a high-quality product at the lowest price.
[00:34:02.344 --> 00:34:03.606]  You support the Infowar.
[00:34:03.946 --> 00:34:09.735]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at InfowarStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
