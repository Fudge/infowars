[00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:19.654]  Cyborgs, bodyhackers, grinders, and biohackers are all about modification to achieve now what most people talk about having in the future.
[00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:26.258]  Bodyhacker Rich Lee, a transhumanist of sorts, recently modified his ears with speakers.
[00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:33.842]  With a coil around his neck and magnets in his ears, he can now hear music anytime without anyone knowing it.
[00:00:34.643 --> 00:00:37.204]  In his YouTube video, he describes the experience.
[00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:38.565]  Let's take a listen.
[00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:39.591]  So it goes like this.
[00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:56.959]  You can stick magnets into your ears, get a coil and an amplifier, stick the coil around your neck, you gotta have a backup supply of batteries like this, but once the coil's on your neck, you can plug a jack into your phone, it's amplified, right?
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.203]  Instead of sending it through earbuds like it would with headphones or whatever, it sends it into a coil.
[00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:07.223]  So what does that do?
[00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:08.444]  That creates a magnetic field
[00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:12.089]  That causes the magnets in my ears to create sound.
[00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.451]  He hopes his design could be used as a GPS navigator or a radiation detector.
[00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:22.652]  In other new wearable technologies, there's the bra with superpowers.
[00:01:23.472 --> 00:01:28.214]  These non-evasive, non-radiogenic bras come from a company called First Warning Systems.
[00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:31.961]  No, it doesn't taser the TSA during a pat-down.
[00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:34.103]  It doesn't look like the fembox.
[00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:37.246]  These bras can detect abnormal cellular changes.
[00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.688]  Truly a breakthrough in breast health.
[00:01:40.488 --> 00:01:47.534]  In more wearable technologies, be on the lookout for an intelligent track suit that provides a program to train better posture.
[00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:53.920]  Before venturing too far into transhumanism, go to InfoWarshop.com and buy Robot Alchemy.
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.826]  Androids, cyborgs, and the magic of artificial life.
[00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:01.332]  I'm Gigi Ornetta with an InfoWars Nightly News Alert.
