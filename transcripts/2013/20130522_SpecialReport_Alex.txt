[00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:21.387]  When I read the headline, don't throw the IRS under the bus, all I could think of was, are you serious?
[00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:22.928]  Who defends the IRS?
[00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:25.469]  The writers at the Daily Beast.
[00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:28.090]  They think the IRS isn't too powerful.
[00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.431]  It's too weak.
[00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:36.954]  In fact, they suggest that Obama just clear his plate of this scandal so he can move on to the next because, of course, this one's all Bush's fault.
[00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:44.855]  The Daily Beast quoted the New York Times saying the Cincinnati office was understaffed, unglamorous, and backwater.
[00:00:45.696 --> 00:00:49.861]  Its ill-trained, low-level staffers rarely discussed politics.
[00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:55.488]  So, was the office in Washington or California that targeted the Tea Party any more glamorous?
[00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:57.569]  Here's a question.
[00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.894]  These ill-trained, low-level staffers that the Daily Beast claims work at the IRS, are they the same ones handling Obamacare?
[00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:06.075]  Wow!
[00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:09.377]  You better hope none of them get your health care information when you have medical needs.
[00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:22.965]  This article is a must-read as it clearly illuminates the thought process of the current administration and how it is not congruent with the Constitution, but more congruent with Nazi Germany.
[00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:24.627]  Here's more from the Beast.
[00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:31.249]  It might seem shrewd for Obama to sit out the IRS scandal while he focuses on bigger fights.
[00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.372]  But this scandal is about government's capacity to make private wealth serve the public interest.
[00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:40.773]  And for a progressive president, there's no bigger fight than that.
[00:01:41.694 --> 00:01:43.034]  Stand up to the tyranny.
