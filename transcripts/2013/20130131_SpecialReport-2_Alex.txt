[00:00:03.348 --> 00:00:08.031]  Well, within the last week there have been two major drills conducted by the military in U.S.
[00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.653]  cities with the cooperation and participation of the police.
[00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:14.415]  Now, this is something we should all be concerned about.
[00:00:14.435 --> 00:00:22.160]  The Founding Fathers are somebody that we look up to because they're the only revolutionary leaders that did not become tyrants themselves.
[00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.003]  They understood human nature and the depravity of human nature.
[00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.699]  And they not only defeated that in others, they resisted it in themselves, and they came up with safeguards and warnings for us as to how this would happen.
[00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.486]  And one of the things that they warned us about was a standing military as well as a central bank.
[00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:45.992]  A standing military will eventually, and has throughout history, become a tool of oppression.
[00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:54.220]  It has happened in our country in the past, where the military has been used to oppress people, and that's why we have the Capacity Comitatus Act.
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.522]  That was to counteract American suppression in the U.S.
[00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:00.543]  by the American military.
[00:01:01.023 --> 00:01:03.044]  Well, let's take a look at some of these recent drills.
[00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:04.985]  January the 28th in Houston.
[00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:10.307]  Helicopters and the sound of gunfire created a lot of concern this afternoon in one Houston neighborhood.
[00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:14.109]  This happened in southeast Houston around the old Carnegie Vanguard High School.
[00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.949]  When you see this, you think the worst.
[00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.930]  She told me, don't come home, because it sounds like we're in a war zone.
[00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.331]  Guns shooting, and helicopters flying around over the house.
[00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:26.812]  And an army major who was out here wouldn't tell us exactly what kind of training they were doing.
[00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:31.533]  HPD was aware of what was going on, but the fire department apparently wasn't.
[00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:34.074]  Well, this is a military assault on a school.
[00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:37.732]  This was done with helicopters, with guns firing, with troops on the ground.
[00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.095]  The residents thought a war was breaking out.
[00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:41.057]  They didn't know what to think.
[00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:42.959]  They were warning family members not to come by.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.663]  Miami, four days earlier, January the 24th, 2013.
[00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:49.468]  Still, if you've seen one of these drills, it really
[00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:54.770]  It is like a scene out of one of those action movies, choppers stalking the sky in downtown Miami.
[00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.011]  Yeah, let me tell you what all of this is that we know of.
[00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:02.452]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[00:02:02.552 --> 00:02:08.014]  As someone shot some video of some of these choppers, military style choppers, flying over 395 in downtown.
[00:02:16.524 --> 00:02:18.786]  You heard the guy, he says, hey, it's like a movie.
[00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:20.348]  I guess it's supposed to be fun.
[00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:22.049]  A lot of people didn't think it was fun.
[00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.332]  A lot of people are very frightened by that because, again, they don't bother to tell people.
[00:02:25.853 --> 00:02:30.437]  But, again, what's concerning about that is notice that he says that they're training with the police.
[00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.480]  It's something that we see happening over and over again.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.481]  Here's another one in Minneapolis, August 28, 2012.
[00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:42.064]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[00:02:42.184 --> 00:02:44.205]  They are training in an urban environment.
[00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:44.925]  The U.S.
[00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:49.506]  Special Operations Command will be conducting these exercises until the beginning of September.
[00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:51.587]  Yep, that's the view outside my window.
[00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:59.409]  That's right, you hear us say, don't be alarmed.
[00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.889]  Everything is perfectly fine.
[00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:03.410]  It's just the American military preparing to attack U.S.
[00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.770]  cities.
[00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:10.728]  Of course, nothing the government ever does is bizarre or to be questioned, just like we are never to question the TSA.
[00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:12.809]  And if we do, we're the ones who are bizarre.
[00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:13.530]  Here's another one.
[00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.030]  St.
[00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.331]  Louis, July 3rd, 2012.
[00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.772]  It's a military mission in North St.
[00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:19.093]  Louis.
[00:03:19.473 --> 00:03:26.376]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town, and while they come in peace, there are all kinds of rumors about why they are here.
[00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:28.798]  We have called army offices in St.
[00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:28.978]  Louis,
[00:03:30.078 --> 00:03:32.560]  And we've called army offices in Washington, D.C.
[00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:38.285]  trying to get information about why this training is going on here and what it's all about.
[00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:41.628]  Well, we haven't heard back from anybody at the army just yet.
[00:03:41.728 --> 00:03:46.852]  When you go out to other countries, when you go out of town, they don't have police officers, they have troops.
[00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:49.915]  I think it kind of scares a lot of people.
[00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:50.915]  Cut down on crime?
[00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:51.436]  Crime, yeah.
[00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:52.697]  Cut down on a whole lot of crime.
[00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:56.820]  I think it's fantastic because it might slow down some of the crime rate.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.882]  You notice that the media takes a little bit different tact.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.022]  It's not, don't worry, or it's fun, it's like a movie.
[00:04:03.402 --> 00:04:10.006]  Here they have two people that say, well, we think it'd be great because it'd be a great way to scare people and get crime down.
[00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:14.389]  Well, no, actually the standing military is a crime.
[00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.951]  And using the army for police functions is a crime.
[00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:19.351]  It doesn't stop crime.
[00:04:19.552 --> 00:04:22.233]  No one who has a different view was presented in this article.
[00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:23.534]  Chicago, April 17, 2012.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.162]  A pretty scary scene along the Chicago River turns out to be a military training exercise.
[00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:37.984]  Two choppers came zooming right up the Chicago River here, close enough almost for us to touch them.
[00:04:38.084 --> 00:04:47.427]  There was nothing routine that folks reported as they witnessed the jarring scene of at least three Black Hawk helicopters zooming in and around residential office towers.
[00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:06.248]  That is two helicopters flying above or flying through downtown Chicago.
[00:05:06.268 --> 00:05:07.369]  It's 930 at night.
[00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.270]  They didn't even have lights on.
[00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.651]  So weird.
[00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:12.893]  They were lower than my buildings.
[00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:17.456]  They were definitely military and they were definitely guys with machine guns.
[00:05:17.677 --> 00:05:22.881]  So I thought that perhaps there was some alarm or concern.
[00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:26.664]  We saw military guys in the helicopters.
[00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:28.185]  They were hanging out of the choppers.
[00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:34.787]  The NATO Summit host committee insists this has nothing at all to do with next month's NATO Summit.
[00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:36.267]  Well, notice some of the things that they said.
[00:05:36.307 --> 00:05:41.809]  Although you're seeing the same things here as you did in other cities, people are talking about how reckless the behavior was.
[00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:50.951]  One of the videos that someone shot, he says, look at this, it's night, and these guys are zigzagging and weaving through skyscrapers at a very low altitude with no lights.
[00:05:51.992 --> 00:05:58.258]  Something of reckless endangerment, but the thing that we're really concerned about, again, is the police and the military joining together.
[00:05:58.578 --> 00:06:01.121]  Take a look at this clip from Los Angeles in January the 26th, 2012.
[00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:13.176]  Special military operation forces in conjunction with the LAPD conducting some military maneuvers that had many people wondering what is going on.
[00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:18.559]  When a Black Hawk helicopter and four OH-6s or little birds flew over the city.
[00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.523]  Duran says the military picks environments based on what they might be facing in the near future.
[00:06:24.103 --> 00:06:25.764]  If it's a mountainous terrain, they go to mountains.
[00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:27.345]  If it's a desert terrain, they use the desert.
[00:06:27.785 --> 00:06:33.189]  Also what we saw here tonight in downtown Los Angeles has been seen in Miami and in Boston.
[00:06:34.813 --> 00:06:35.974]  Now, do you notice what he said?
[00:06:36.614 --> 00:06:39.257]  He said, if it's a mountainous terrain, they go to the mountains.
[00:06:39.317 --> 00:06:40.718]  If it's desert, they go to the desert.
[00:06:41.118 --> 00:06:42.619]  If it's the coast, they go to the coast.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.201]  Why are they going to American cities?
[00:06:45.662 --> 00:06:47.663]  Do you have cities like that in Afghanistan or Iraq?
[00:06:48.203 --> 00:06:49.985]  Are they planning to invade Iran?
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.066]  But if they're planning to invade Iran, why are they coordinating with American police?
[00:06:55.146 --> 00:07:00.233]  Do they think that the Iranian police are going to coordinate with them on an attack and an invasion of Iran?
[00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:00.994]  No.
[00:07:01.535 --> 00:07:01.875]  If the U.S.
[00:07:01.915 --> 00:07:06.782]  military attacks American cities, they will get the cooperation of the police, or at least some of them.
[00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.844]  Now, all these things have happened within the last year.
[00:07:10.424 --> 00:07:24.512]  All these reports we just showed you in all these cities, major military drills involving the police and the military working together to take over American cities, training, as the man just pointed out, for the scenario that they're expecting to execute.
[00:07:24.672 --> 00:07:26.133]  This has been going on for a long time.
[00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:27.013]  It's just accelerating.
[00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:29.855]  Let's take a look at this clip where we sent a team to Chicago.
[00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:35.238]  They saw there a National Guard training with local police and the Polish military.
[00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:59.909]  Now, in just a few seconds you're going to see some Boy Scouts in rubber jumpsuits.
[00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:02.790]  That's right, they're pulling the Boy Scouts in on us.
[00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.911]  Everybody on the ground!
[00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.051]  Get on the ground on your knees!
[00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:09.112]  Everybody on the ground, on the ground!
[00:08:09.172 --> 00:08:10.093]  Put your hands on your face!
[00:08:10.653 --> 00:08:11.794]  On the ground, on the ground!
[00:08:12.154 --> 00:08:14.194]  The Boy Scouts are being trained to be victims.
[00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:16.175]  Do not move!
[00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.196]  Cover your face with your hands!
[00:08:18.256 --> 00:08:21.237]  Cover your face with your hands!
[00:08:21.257 --> 00:08:24.939]  In just a few minutes, the Polish military is going to come in in full combat gear.
[00:08:25.652 --> 00:08:26.592]  It's a very real life situation.
[00:08:26.612 --> 00:08:27.293]  Hostages, you are expendable.
[00:08:27.313 --> 00:08:29.233]  Please put your face directly in the powder.
[00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:57.493]  Yeah, all of a sudden the Polish BOA is participating in this exercise, which they didn't mention at all before that.
[00:08:57.513 --> 00:08:59.975]  It was just, they're here to observe, they're here to observe.
[00:09:00.356 --> 00:09:01.677]  Hey, it's BOA.
[00:09:02.378 --> 00:09:06.682]  Bureau of Operational Anti-Terrorism, is what I think it's called.
[00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:12.188]  So I don't know, this was a hard one to swallow, watching these guys train.
[00:09:12.448 --> 00:09:20.953]  Now on Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, that we produced in 2010, we have guardsmen training to find weapons caches in Arcadia, Iowa.
[00:09:21.474 --> 00:09:24.435]  And we have an interview with a lieutenant colonel with the National Guard there.
[00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:30.099]  It says in this article, going door to door asking if they can search homes looking for weapons.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.381]  And they practice raiding the local gun shop.
[00:09:34.202 --> 00:09:35.823]  This is for domestic operations.
[00:09:39.707 --> 00:09:42.828]  Lieutenant Colonel, I really appreciate you coming on on such short notice, sir.
[00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:44.149]  My pleasure.
[00:09:44.189 --> 00:09:45.089]  Thanks for the invitation.
[00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:45.850]  You bet.
[00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.592]  I saw this article out of the Daily Times Herald in Carroll, Iowa.
[00:09:50.752 --> 00:09:51.412]  Have you seen that?
[00:09:52.172 --> 00:09:52.752]  I sure have.
[00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:59.535]  And it's telling us about an urban warfare drill to be held in several towns.
[00:09:59.555 --> 00:10:00.836]  Can you tell us about that?
[00:10:01.812 --> 00:10:19.729]  Sure, it's actually a planned training event to provide our soldiers with greater proficiency at what we call Coordinate Search, which is a mission that, just for a little background, we've deployed nearly 13,000 members of the Iowa National Guard in the Global War on Terror.
[00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:42.455]  And the vast majority of those have been in Iraq and Afghanistan, and one of the missions that they perform in Iraq and Afghanistan on multiple occasions is coordinate search, where basically you are trying to get to an area, coordinate off to make sure everything's safe, and then actually search for caches of weapons or other kinds of contraband which could harm American forces.
[00:10:42.715 --> 00:10:45.177]  Like Fallujah, what we saw in Fallujah.
[00:10:45.737 --> 00:10:46.958]  Correct, exactly.
[00:10:47.578 --> 00:10:56.403]  So, because of where we're located in Iowa, there are no active duty bases in Iowa, so we kind of have to create our own urban training environments.
[00:10:57.344 --> 00:11:02.887]  So, the plan on this particular training event was to actually use a small town of about 450 people.
[00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:14.234]  The town has actually kind of adopted the unit, which is called Company A, 1st Battalion, 168th Infantry, and they were more than willing to participate in the exercise.
[00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.053]  Well, we showed you Boy Scouts being trained to be victims.
[00:11:18.513 --> 00:11:20.616]  They're also training them to be aggressors.
[00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:27.223]  In a New York Times article in 2009, it says, Scouts to train to fight terrorists and more.
[00:11:27.784 --> 00:11:28.905]  Oh, what would that more be?
[00:11:28.925 --> 00:11:30.767]  The person who is helping them is A.J.
[00:11:30.827 --> 00:11:32.128]  Lowenthal, a sheriff's deputy.
[00:11:32.168 --> 00:11:36.173]  He says, this is about being a true-blooded American guy and girl.
[00:11:36.973 --> 00:11:42.796]  Now, they also had them not only be aggressive with SWAT team raids, they also conducted a marijuana raid.
[00:11:43.376 --> 00:11:47.778]  And at one point, the guy says, put him on his face and put a knee in his back.
[00:11:48.398 --> 00:11:49.818]  I guarantee he'll shut up.
[00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:53.080]  Well, that's the kind of training they're giving the Boy Scouts.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.201]  Not helping little ladies cross the street anymore.
[00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:58.182]  Just put them on their face and put a knee in their back to make them shut up.
[00:11:58.922 --> 00:12:00.803]  Well, we've got another clip here from Police State 2000.
[00:12:01.064 --> 00:12:05.087]  Now, in this one, Alex interviews a police chief from San Antonio.
[00:12:05.487 --> 00:12:12.032]  He had to kick out Delta Force for trying to bribe city officials in order to conduct training exercises there.
[00:12:13.737 --> 00:12:25.042]  As far as we know, this is the first time that local law enforcement, local police leadership has actively stood up against Bill Clinton's new military.
[00:12:25.362 --> 00:12:32.365]  What were your major reservations in asking the mayor to tell them that y'all didn't want them to train here and to cease training here?
[00:12:32.945 --> 00:12:34.546]  Well, a lot of things happened.
[00:12:34.646 --> 00:12:40.547]  First of all, the organization came into the city and never really approached the city as a whole.
[00:12:40.567 --> 00:12:46.069]  In other words, it got together with the mayor and said, we need to speak to all these different departments and request some assistance.
[00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:52.231]  Various groups and individuals came into the city and approached different people at different levels.
[00:12:52.911 --> 00:12:54.733]  The police department was contacted.
[00:12:54.793 --> 00:12:58.235]  The city manager's office was contacted about using city facilities.
[00:12:58.776 --> 00:13:02.399]  Various business owners were contacted through the economic development department.
[00:13:03.099 --> 00:13:06.081]  The fire department was contacted by different individuals.
[00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:11.706]  So there was never any coordinated approach to the city of San Antonio.
[00:13:12.937 --> 00:13:16.779]  When we found out about it, we had some reservations, but we were willing at least to listen.
[00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:24.202]  But then we started finding out that discussions were happening at other different levels, and there was no communication, no coordination between that.
[00:13:24.642 --> 00:13:30.545]  Well then, when we said no, then some elected officials were contacted to bring pressure to bear.
[00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:40.634]  And then offers were made to give money, cash money, to elected officials' charities if they could get us to change our minds.
[00:13:41.234 --> 00:13:44.880]  I mean, you know, as one of my deputy chiefs said, in some circles that's called bribery.
[00:13:45.455 --> 00:13:51.538]  Well, we have a long history of the military and the police working together in this country training for martial law.
[00:13:51.558 --> 00:13:55.880]  And Alex has pointed that out for a long time in his documentaries and on the air.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.662]  What's alarming about this, however, is the increasing rate at which this is happening.
[00:14:01.042 --> 00:14:05.764]  As I said, we just had in the last week, we had two major cities where there were two major exercises.
[00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:07.965]  The one that happened just a couple of days ago in Houston.
[00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:10.406]  They're firing guns and attacking schools.
[00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:17.452]  What is happening is we're seeing the militarization of the police and we're seeing the military used as police.
[00:14:17.972 --> 00:14:19.613]  That's a very frightening perspective.
[00:14:19.994 --> 00:14:21.714]  We've seen that before in our country's history.
[00:14:21.955 --> 00:14:23.415]  We've seen it in other countries.
[00:14:23.755 --> 00:14:25.236]  And in spite of what the people in St.
[00:14:25.256 --> 00:14:29.058]  Louis said that they put on the media, that is not something that reduces crime.
[00:14:29.338 --> 00:14:33.000]  What it does is it makes criminals out of both the military and the police.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:40.264]  So we hope that there'll be more people like that San Antonio police chief who has the integrity and the wisdom to stand against this.
