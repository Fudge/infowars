[00:00:04.912 --> 00:00:09.777]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.777 --> 00:00:11.379]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.125]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:21.189]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:39.118]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:42.461]  This is going to be a particularly powerful broadcast today.
[00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:51.210]  Dr. Jerome Corsi of WorldNetDaily and of course of all the New York Times number one bestsellers is scheduled to be in studio with us coming up later in the hour.
[00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:58.131]  And obviously I'm going to be covering a lot of important news in the meantime.
[00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:07.214]  The news is all so completely out of control and over the top that I don't even know how to respond at this point.
[00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:14.117]  If you go up to Infowars.com, airport terror announcements now being played in hotels.
[00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:20.119]  I mean, this is beyond 1984, where Big Brother's only in government buildings saying, watch your neighbors, look out for terrorists.
[00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.180]  This is now in the hotels.
[00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:27.286]  And they spy on the patrons and fill out data sheets on you even while you're eating.
[00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:31.631]  This is 5,000 plus major US hotels signed on to do this.
[00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:32.632]  All official.
[00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:38.098]  TSA is now conducting random warrantless checkpoints on South Lamar.
[00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.840]  That's about a mile and a half from where I'm sitting.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.383]  And are searching people's persons and bags.
[00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:46.608]  Uh, and they announced they're just gonna do whatever they want.
[00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:50.935]  I was told this about three months ago by a senior Austin police officer.
[00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:52.237]  He said they'd been told that...
[00:01:53.723 --> 00:02:05.051]  They can't search someone without a warrant, but the federal government is basically putting us under a civil emergency quietly, and that they're being told that you can do it when the TSA is there with you.
[00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:12.317]  And Austin police bullied people into being groped, and it's on local ABC News.
[00:02:12.317 --> 00:02:14.558]  We have the clip up there.
[00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:17.881]  This is going on yesterday while I'm on the radio.
[00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.683]  And reportedly, they're going to be back.
[00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.141]  So it's going to be a semi-permanent deal just like Dallas and Houston.
[00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:31.583]  And I tell people five years ago TSA was showing up in Dallas and people said that's not true, I haven't seen it on the news.
[00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:33.403]  But I talked to family that saw it.
[00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.105]  And about two years ago they started having it in the news.
[00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:39.366]  Oh there's no way you're going to have feds searching people on the side of the road.
[00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:41.727]  Well it's going on right now.
[00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:46.068]  And I mean they had the army out at public events searching us in Austin and they never announced it.
[00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:47.689]  It's there to acclimate the condition.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.941]  Well, the border is wide open.
[00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:51.642]  In fact, I have video we haven't even aired yet.
[00:02:51.642 --> 00:03:07.693]  We've been so overwhelmed and busy of illegal aliens just crossing in droves on the Texas-Mexico border while the Border Patrol backs up park rangers harassing a UT alumni group of lawyers sitting around drinking a few Courage Lights.
[00:03:07.693 --> 00:03:09.775]  And they were writing them tickets, everything else.
[00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:12.097]  And I'm like, hey, there's illegal aliens right there.
[00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:16.484]  And just laughing at me.
[00:03:16.484 --> 00:03:20.765]  And then driving 70 miles, you know, from up by the border into the U.S.
[00:03:20.765 --> 00:03:23.346]  and coming to a checkpoint where they wanted to search the vehicle.
[00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:28.027]  But I basically, you know, got in their face and told them, no, well, we've got all the footage of this.
[00:03:28.027 --> 00:03:28.988]  I mean, it's us.
[00:03:28.988 --> 00:03:30.348]  We comply.
[00:03:30.348 --> 00:03:32.269]  So we are slaves.
[00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:39.051]  And then I have off the chart video in Illinois where the neighbor and
[00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:59.030]  The homeowner, the police come and go over their fence without a warrant with the power company to put smart meters on that on record eavesdrop on you and dial into all your new smart appliances on record and control how hot or cold your house can be and double charge you and all the rest of this garbage.
[00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.913]  It was developed by Enron 15 years ago as part of their fraud program and the police
[00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:10.346]  They're standing on the street and the police say, I don't give you authorization to film me.
[00:04:10.346 --> 00:04:18.089]  The woman put it on YouTube and the police came, this is in the Chicago Tribune, and arrested her and are charging her with resisting.
[00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.731]  They say in the affidavit, talking to them was resisting.
[00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:25.557]  And the woman's like, you don't have a right to be in my backyard.
[00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:26.798]  I don't want this smart meter.
[00:04:26.798 --> 00:04:28.699]  I've told them I don't want it.
[00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.482]  And the police say, we'll do whatever we want.
[00:04:31.482 --> 00:04:33.443]  And they look like total goons.
[00:04:33.443 --> 00:04:34.825]  And then they came and arrested her.
[00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:37.187]  And they said, you're lucky we're not charging you with a felony.
[00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:40.189]  Actually, the courts have thrown it out over 100 times in Illinois.
[00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:43.812]  They're doing it as the misdemeanor so they can trick her in the regular court.
[00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:46.930]  To not getting her jury trial.
[00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.456]  I mean, this government is absolutely rapacious and criminal.
[00:04:51.456 --> 00:04:52.878]  We're all in grave danger.
[00:04:52.878 --> 00:04:57.224]  The founders warned us, keep government on a short leash or it'll put you on a leash.
[00:05:00.305 --> 00:05:05.786]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:08.207]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:13.908]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[00:05:13.908 --> 00:05:17.309]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:20.749]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:22.430]  There's no priming required.
[00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.690]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.211]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:29.792]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:31.213]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:05:31.213 --> 00:05:34.395]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:37.777]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:05:37.777 --> 00:05:41.899]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:44.641]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:46.222]  It's what my family uses.
[00:05:46.222 --> 00:05:49.544]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[00:07:04.261 --> 00:07:05.522]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.522 --> 00:07:09.464]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.464 --> 00:07:11.685]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:17.548]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:17.548 --> 00:07:23.771]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:30.193]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:30.193 --> 00:07:34.395]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:38.656]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.656 --> 00:07:44.619]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:48.160]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.141]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:50.581]  It's here.
[00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:58.074]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:16.506]  It is Friday, the 25th day of January 2013.
[00:08:16.506 --> 00:08:23.049]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:24.709]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is here.
[00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:27.771]  He'll be in studio with us coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:30.632]  We have other guests today coming up as well.
[00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:33.515]  Okay, where to start?
[00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:52.127]  Number one, Dianne Feinstein's gun confiscation bill, because that's basically what it does, and it bans hundreds and hundreds of guns, not 150, exempts police and retired police and other government workers for life from these laws.
[00:08:52.127 --> 00:08:54.148]  This is a title of nobility.
[00:08:55.512 --> 00:08:56.773]  That's what nobility was.
[00:08:56.773 --> 00:09:06.801]  You could be signed up as a sir, was the lowest level, and then ride up to lords and dukes and barons.
[00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:10.884]  If you would serve the system, well, you're exempt from all the laws.
[00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:17.470]  And that's what one of the Rockefellers told the late, great filmmaker Aaron Russo in Hollywood.
[00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.053]  He told him, look, we're all going to have a microchip that says, kiss my butt.
[00:09:22.053 --> 00:09:24.916]  Using the more pejorative term, kiss my, you know what?
[00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:33.632]  Where we're just above the law, national security, we go around the checkpoints, around the body scanners, around the control, we're exempt, you're not.
[00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:35.555]  You'll all be face scanned and controlled.
[00:09:35.555 --> 00:09:39.222]  Well, Rand Corporation, MIT, they've all said that is the plan.
[00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:46.093]  And we are going under martial law, incrementally.
[00:09:46.093 --> 00:09:57.547]  Checkpoints all over the highways, police taking blood without warrants, now gang gun checkpoints all over the country where they randomly, from New York to Texas, pull you over and search your car.
[00:09:57.547 --> 00:09:59.929]  Totally illegal, but it's being announced.
[00:10:00.984 --> 00:10:03.905]  We got the video coming up of this in the audio for radio listeners.
[00:10:03.905 --> 00:10:07.547]  The article's up at Infowars.com right now.
[00:10:07.547 --> 00:10:11.168]  TSA conducts random checks at Austin train station.
[00:10:11.168 --> 00:10:16.031]  Well, actually, they did it out on South Lamar on the road downtown.
[00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:17.671]  And we have the video.
[00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:18.432]  That is coming up.
[00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:26.057]  We have, again, Feinstein gun control bill to exempt government officials.
[00:10:26.057 --> 00:10:29.560]  That's anybody in government, federal government, for life, and police.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.543]  See, the police are like, well, I don't want to give my guns up when I retire.
[00:10:32.543 --> 00:10:35.525]  Well, they're saying, don't worry, you're going to be exempt.
[00:10:35.525 --> 00:10:39.428]  They told the Russian military and the Russian federal police the same thing in 1917.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.802]  And so they went along with the gun confiscation of the general public.
[00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:46.783]  And of course, you know what happened to the police and military after that.
[00:10:46.783 --> 00:10:59.791]  This is a totally unconstitutional, discriminatory, but see, you're taught discrimination is black, white, north, south, man, woman, Hispanic, white, Catholic, Protestant.
[00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:00.491]  You're taught all that.
[00:11:00.491 --> 00:11:08.056]  No, discrimination is the big mega banks exempt from taxes, lobbying to have your taxes raised to give themselves corporate welfare, your money.
[00:11:09.332 --> 00:11:21.099]  Discrimination is governments exempt from smart meter corporate taxes, but you are double, triple charged.
[00:11:21.099 --> 00:11:24.381]  Smart meters and all of this are the tools of total control.
[00:11:25.646 --> 00:11:42.923]  And we actually have articles here out of the Daily Caller, but also one out of the Huffington Post, where they quote the Democrats, and Governor Cuomo and others is saying, it doesn't exclude retired police officers, so all of them have to turn in their guns and magazines and stuff like that.
[00:11:42.923 --> 00:11:49.350]  He said, what they did is disarm the good guys and make sure the bad guys outlaw them.
[00:11:52.014 --> 00:11:54.976]  That was said by a police officer.
[00:11:54.976 --> 00:12:00.478]  But, so now they're talking about trying to pass a law in New York so, oh, the police can keep their guns.
[00:12:00.478 --> 00:12:01.059]  Here's another one.
[00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:04.420]  Feinstein gun control bill to exempt government officials.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:10.283]  Not everyone will have and be able to abide by Senator Dianne Feinstein's gun control bill.
[00:12:10.283 --> 00:12:15.005]  If the proposed legislation becomes law, government officials, not servants, they are officials.
[00:12:15.005 --> 00:12:16.486]  They are royalty.
[00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.467]  Red carpets, everything.
[00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:19.948]  And others will be exempt.
[00:12:22.423 --> 00:12:29.165]  And it goes on to say, feds, police, and others that can get a federal waiver.
[00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.186]  So see, that's out of the weekly standard.
[00:12:31.186 --> 00:12:34.967]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what our forebearers revolted against.
[00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:37.668]  You could not buy land
[00:12:39.053 --> 00:12:42.475]  Unless you were nobility in the colonies, large pieces of land.
[00:12:42.475 --> 00:12:49.478]  You couldn't get an export license or an import license unless you were, quote, part of the gentry nobility, a sir or above.
[00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:51.899]  You know, a lord's son.
[00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:58.042]  And so everybody sat there, not able to do business, not able to live, watching lesser men run everything.
[00:12:59.909 --> 00:13:02.510]  George Washington couldn't manufacture carriages.
[00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.771]  He wanted to.
[00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:10.215]  He had to buy at five, six times what they cost in England, on top of the shipping, his gentleman's carriage.
[00:13:11.974 --> 00:13:14.155]  You had to buy the finished clothes from England.
[00:13:14.155 --> 00:13:15.096]  There were laws.
[00:13:15.096 --> 00:13:20.178]  You couldn't make firearms, you couldn't make hammers, you couldn't make nails, you couldn't have finished goods here.
[00:13:20.178 --> 00:13:29.163]  As a globalist tool, mercantile tool, to not let development take place and to make everything be back in the home country where the globalist, where the empire controlled things.
[00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:35.566]  Just like today, it can only be made in China because of regulations here that make it impossible to be competitive.
[00:13:35.566 --> 00:13:37.527]  Well, back then they just outright outlawed it.
[00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:46.511]  This is why our forebearers were willing to lose everything and die, because they were sick of literally being spit on by the royals.
[00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:50.216]  And now government with the red carpets and the officials and the titles.
[00:13:50.216 --> 00:13:53.761]  I mean, I saw Dianne Feinstein and all of her minions up there.
[00:13:54.642 --> 00:14:03.465]  Yesterday, with all of the traitor police chiefs of the big city crime syndicates that they brought in, and they had two cordons in front of the guns going.
[00:14:03.465 --> 00:14:05.346]  We have to have two cordons in front of this.
[00:14:05.346 --> 00:14:09.807]  None of the media can even walk by the assault weapons, the semi-autos, because they're so dangerous.
[00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:10.728]  I actually have CNN saying this.
[00:14:10.728 --> 00:14:12.668]  We're going to play the clip later.
[00:14:12.668 --> 00:14:14.069]  There's just total mind control.
[00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:16.510]  Talking to us like we're three years old, saying the boogeyman's over there.
[00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.953]  And Feinstein saying, I got a special waiver to even have these unloaded guns here.
[00:14:21.953 --> 00:14:23.533]  Like, oh, they're so deadly.
[00:14:23.533 --> 00:14:38.941]  Again, I've always told you they have these sitcoms and dramas based in New York where guns are banned, where everybody sees the image of guns being illegal and people going to jail for having guns, to where a carpet cleaners in your house sees a gun case and calls the police in Texas or Arizona.
[00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:39.902]  This happens all the time.
[00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:54.517]  And the future, they're saying Homeland Security will respond to any reports of even legal guns and go ahead and take them to quote, make sure you're not a criminal and then make you go through psychiatric evaluation if anyone calls on you saying you have guns.
[00:14:54.517 --> 00:14:56.778]  This has all been announced.
[00:14:56.778 --> 00:14:58.699]  Okay, so they know what they're doing.
[00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:03.342]  Behind two cordons, we have the guns, they're so deadly.
[00:15:03.342 --> 00:15:06.404]  And these police chiefs say ban them.
[00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:18.695]  And they themselves, the New York Police Department, it's in the news right here in my stack, is lobbying to have a new bill passed so they can keep their guns when they retire.
[00:15:18.695 --> 00:15:20.857]  Unbelievably wicked criminals.
[00:15:21.718 --> 00:15:27.622]  Vicious, hateful, and they say in these quotes, we've got to protect ourselves from criminals once we retire.
[00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:35.748]  There's a quote in the Huffington Post, the irony is not lost on anybody, saying, well, I mean, once we retire, we've got to have guns to protect ourselves.
[00:15:35.748 --> 00:15:37.729]  The criminals are still going to have guns.
[00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:38.129]  Really?
[00:15:38.129 --> 00:15:42.992]  The criminals are still going to have guns?
[00:15:42.992 --> 00:15:46.515]  Oh, you're going to have guns, because you're the new royalty.
[00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:47.896]  You're the officials.
[00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:54.833]  You're the authorities, not the servants, not the peace officers.
[00:15:54.833 --> 00:15:58.556]  You are the law enforcement officers.
[00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:03.299]  And the movies and the culture show nothing but the citizens groveling to the police.
[00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:06.561]  Now, I'm going to get to the TSA checkpoints where I live.
[00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:10.183]  See, the army was out a few months ago.
[00:16:10.183 --> 00:16:14.225]  And Austinites should just rise up and go to the city council and the state capitol.
[00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:15.626]  This is all illegal.
[00:16:15.626 --> 00:16:17.127]  I want them out.
[00:16:17.127 --> 00:16:17.928]  This is illegal.
[00:16:19.485 --> 00:16:20.465]  And it's all getting you ready.
[00:16:20.465 --> 00:16:23.726]  Why are they getting you ready for trips on the streets and TSA checkpoints?
[00:16:23.726 --> 00:16:25.327]  I mean, down the street from me.
[00:16:25.327 --> 00:16:26.447]  On the road.
[00:16:26.447 --> 00:16:29.048]  Searching people.
[00:16:29.048 --> 00:16:30.088]  Illegally.
[00:16:30.088 --> 00:16:31.909]  Violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:32.489]  Tenth Amendment.
[00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:33.490]  Ninth Amendment.
[00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.310]  Why are they doing this?
[00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:46.398]  Ladies and gentlemen, because they're criminals, they're collapsing the whole society, and they know they're all going to jail if they don't totally take over and arrest their opposition.
[00:16:46.398 --> 00:16:48.479]  They've stolen tens of trillions, the derivatives.
[00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:53.840]  The people running things make Ken Lay look like a choir boy, an angel.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.621]  Literally.
[00:16:55.621 --> 00:16:59.982]  They are total ruthless mafia, and they know that we're waking up to them.
[00:16:59.982 --> 00:17:01.503]  They know there's a 9% approval rating.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.682]  New evidence has come out on CNN that I'm going to be airing tonight.
[00:17:05.682 --> 00:17:08.805]  That's all I've got to say concerning the Sandy Hook shooting.
[00:17:08.805 --> 00:17:09.986]  You know I have questions about it.
[00:17:09.986 --> 00:17:10.486]  I always do.
[00:17:10.486 --> 00:17:17.472]  They have a history of staging these things, so I believe and know people were killed there from the evidence we have, but there was definitely all the signs this is being managed.
[00:17:17.472 --> 00:17:19.153]  In fact, now it's pretty conclusive.
[00:17:19.153 --> 00:17:20.394]  I'm going to air that tonight.
[00:17:20.394 --> 00:17:22.796]  I'm shaking to my core right now.
[00:17:22.796 --> 00:17:24.117]  I mean, again,
[00:17:25.302 --> 00:17:28.363]  Every instinct I've got is to flee this country right now.
[00:17:28.363 --> 00:17:37.947]  And I know others are bad as well, but I mean, this country is gonna be the center of the nastiest stuff the world has ever seen if these crooks get their way.
[00:17:37.947 --> 00:17:41.488]  And all of you that serve the system, you're gonna wish later you'd done something.
[00:17:41.488 --> 00:17:44.029]  The prosperity, everything, it's gone.
[00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:47.611]  It's gonna be totally gone, like oxygen out of the room.
[00:17:47.611 --> 00:17:50.652]  I saw footage this morning when I got up at about 6 a.m.
[00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:52.513]  at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:54.957 --> 00:18:00.019]  That Paul Watson did an article on that really hurt me.
[00:18:00.019 --> 00:18:06.381]  Now I've had the people on charge with life in prison for filming cops in public in Illinois.
[00:18:06.381 --> 00:18:11.122]  Courts throw it out, state appeals, they want to put you in jail for life for filming them.
[00:18:11.122 --> 00:18:19.125]  This is an upscale neighborhood, the footage up at Infowars.com, the neighbor's friends with the attractive red-headed housewife.
[00:18:20.704 --> 00:18:26.528]  And the police are going over their fence, putting in the smart meter, and she goes, look, wireless makes my son sick.
[00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:28.189]  We've discovered this.
[00:18:28.189 --> 00:18:29.070]  I've discovered it.
[00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.152]  It's certainly happening.
[00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:35.235]  But regardless, the things spy on you on record and tie into all the new electronics.
[00:18:35.235 --> 00:18:36.135]  They admit that.
[00:18:36.135 --> 00:18:37.857]  They're designed so they tie into it.
[00:18:37.857 --> 00:18:39.598]  They brag about this.
[00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:43.721]  And the police look like total scary goons.
[00:18:43.721 --> 00:18:49.566]  And they are now charging her with resisting police.
[00:18:50.984 --> 00:18:51.804]  For talking to her.
[00:18:51.804 --> 00:18:53.805]  I've got the affidavit.
[00:18:53.805 --> 00:18:58.368]  And they're charging her for eavesdropping.
[00:18:58.368 --> 00:19:00.149]  And they arrested her.
[00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:02.290]  They came back and said, we saw that on YouTube.
[00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.351]  You didn't have a right to film me in public.
[00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:07.232]  While they film us and put smart meters on the spy on us.
[00:19:07.232 --> 00:19:11.134]  And break the law crossing their property to put this on their house.
[00:19:11.134 --> 00:19:14.296]  While she's telling them don't do it.
[00:19:14.296 --> 00:19:19.719]  And then the police chief of the town, I have it all listed here.
[00:19:20.697 --> 00:19:22.118]  It's also the Chicago Tribune.
[00:19:22.118 --> 00:19:24.080]  They're reporting it like it's good.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.582]  Came and arrested the neighbor who was there.
[00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:27.703]  Her friend called her.
[00:19:27.703 --> 00:19:29.665]  The woman's barefooted in the cold.
[00:19:29.665 --> 00:19:34.569]  Because her neighbor called her and she's like, please, you don't have a right to be on my property.
[00:19:34.569 --> 00:19:36.630]  The cops just pushed past her.
[00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.832]  Bust open the fence, go in.
[00:19:38.832 --> 00:19:40.514]  They're placing it.
[00:19:40.514 --> 00:19:45.358]  The woman's standing on the street filming him and they imagine the police came and arrested her.
[00:19:45.358 --> 00:19:47.319]  Next they're going to disappear us.
[00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:48.981]  And they want life in prison for the woman.
[00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.391]  Life in prison.
[00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:52.692]  We have links to them.
[00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:56.496]  Life in prison for filming them on the sidewalk.
[00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.758]  Now folks, tell me we're not living in a FEMA camp.
[00:20:00.526 --> 00:20:04.528]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[00:20:04.528 --> 00:20:12.032]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[00:20:12.032 --> 00:20:14.733]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[00:20:14.733 --> 00:20:21.336]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[00:20:21.336 --> 00:20:22.457]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[00:20:22.737 --> 00:20:31.767]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[00:20:31.767 --> 00:20:35.752]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[00:20:35.752 --> 00:20:37.614]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:20:37.794 --> 00:20:40.096]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[00:21:01.587 --> 00:21:03.188]  Time and time again.

[00:21:06.109 --> 00:21:07.570]  We need assistance.
[00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.370]  Please!
[00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.691]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:21:11.691 --> 00:21:18.354]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:21:18.354 --> 00:21:20.875]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:21.856]  Take action now.

[00:21:48.048 --> 00:21:52.815]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[00:21:52.815 --> 00:21:57.202]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com
[00:21:59.994 --> 00:22:05.315]  Do you know how much the dollar has lost in its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[00:22:05.315 --> 00:22:10.537]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[00:22:10.537 --> 00:22:14.358]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[00:22:14.358 --> 00:22:20.679]  Put another way, who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:24.180]  Gold is the only monetary asset that is no one else's liability.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.384]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[00:22:27.384 --> 00:22:29.988]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[00:22:29.988 --> 00:22:31.611]  You can possess it in your hand.
[00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:32.872]  You can take it with you.
[00:22:32.872 --> 00:22:34.034]  Gold is real money.
[00:22:34.034 --> 00:22:35.536]  Gold is honest money.
[00:22:35.536 --> 00:22:37.840]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.703]  To find out how you can protect your savings,
[00:22:40.003 --> 00:22:40.403]  We're good.
[00:22:59.574 --> 00:23:01.997]  Is 2013 your year to achieve more?
[00:23:01.997 --> 00:23:03.218]  More vitality?
[00:23:03.218 --> 00:23:03.979]  More health?
[00:23:03.979 --> 00:23:04.680]  More well-being?
[00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:18.215]  Thank you!
[00:23:36.317 --> 00:23:38.699]  Go to rnafreesample.com.
[00:23:38.699 --> 00:23:41.701]  That's rnafreesample.com.
[00:23:41.701 --> 00:23:43.603]  Or call me, toll free, at 888-577-3703.
[00:23:43.603 --> 00:23:45.344]  That's 888-577-3703. rnafreesample.com.
[00:23:45.344 --> 00:23:47.225]  Discover the more that's waiting for you.
[00:24:05.197 --> 00:24:07.779]  Ladies and gentlemen, we even have video of it.
[00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:14.505]  Alex Jones here back live at 5,500 plus major hotels in the U.S.
[00:24:14.505 --> 00:24:17.647]  We have the press releases up there from the companies.
[00:24:17.647 --> 00:24:29.597]  They are now announcing what we first showed you about two years ago with the FEMA training videos for TSA, where you walk around the hotel and it says, look for terrorists, report suspicious things.
[00:24:29.597 --> 00:24:31.638]  Or you go in the Walmarts and there's the telescreens.
[00:24:31.638 --> 00:24:33.040]  They're now going in everywhere.
[00:24:34.048 --> 00:24:39.213]  And when you go up, not just to get a rent car, but to check in, they ask you, who are you coming to see?
[00:24:39.213 --> 00:24:40.174]  What's going on?
[00:24:40.174 --> 00:24:43.377]  They are entering it into a Homeland Security database.
[00:24:43.377 --> 00:24:47.020]  So imagine, everything is a police conversation.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:52.946]  This makes the East German Stasi look like cavemen when it came to spying.
[00:24:54.505 --> 00:24:58.850]  And it's all happening, quote, for Al-Qaeda, who our government publicly now runs.
[00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.652]  Do I get an apology from everybody?
[00:25:00.652 --> 00:25:05.758]  Britons and other Westerners told Ali Benghazi, after imminent terror threat by Al-Qaeda, the same Al-Qaeda they gave Libya.
[00:25:06.578 --> 00:25:08.919]  And I think you're so dumb you won't remember that.
[00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:11.821]  Now they're saying, we've got to have checkpoints on highways, as I predicted.
[00:25:11.821 --> 00:25:12.862]  In fact, I have that.
[00:25:12.862 --> 00:25:16.164]  Because Al-Qaeda may have gotten heat-seeking missiles out of Libya.
[00:25:16.164 --> 00:25:17.645]  I don't even have time to toot my horn.
[00:25:17.645 --> 00:25:23.068]  How many times I told you in the last year, since they got all those heat-seekers, 10,000 plus of them, they'd be saying that.
[00:25:23.068 --> 00:25:25.950]  Now they're saying heat-seeking missiles.
[00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:30.893]  Our government gives them the heat-seeking missiles and now is going to run checkpoints where I live.
[00:25:30.893 --> 00:25:33.694]  And I will not put up with it, you terrorist!
[00:25:33.694 --> 00:25:34.375]  I know you did it!
[00:25:35.356 --> 00:25:37.298]  And again, it's not, quote, even our government.
[00:25:37.298 --> 00:25:38.779]  Most of the government's compartmentalized.
[00:25:38.779 --> 00:25:40.260]  It's the foreign megabanks.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.981]  This is how they're going to take over.
[00:25:41.981 --> 00:25:43.903]  They tell you it's for Al-Qaeda, it's for the American people.
[00:25:43.903 --> 00:25:46.285]  Now, Illinois is the worst about this.
[00:25:46.285 --> 00:25:50.408]  And we're on several stations in Illinois, including Chicago.
[00:25:50.408 --> 00:25:51.509]  And I see these videos.
[00:25:51.509 --> 00:25:57.093]  We've had people on from Illinois who've been charged with life imprisonment, got thrown out by the judge.
[00:25:57.093 --> 00:26:00.576]  But the state came and did a brief and said, no, we want this guy in jail.
[00:26:02.042 --> 00:26:04.884]  Now this woman calls her neighbor, she comes over, they're filming.
[00:26:04.884 --> 00:26:07.566]  If you're a radio listener, I'm gonna narrate it for you.
[00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:09.368]  They go, oh, very nice neighborhood.
[00:26:09.368 --> 00:26:12.310]  It looks like they're $500,000 houses.
[00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.251]  Or more.
[00:26:14.251 --> 00:26:17.954]  Nice, and again, my point is nice, attractive, conservative-looking women.
[00:26:17.954 --> 00:26:21.236]  I mean, no one's safe, folks, okay?
[00:26:21.236 --> 00:26:23.178]  And the police look like total goons.
[00:26:23.178 --> 00:26:24.979]  They have that arrogant, sly look.
[00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:25.960]  Like, we can do whatever we want.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.921]  They have the look of gangsters.
[00:26:28.499 --> 00:26:30.380]  I mean, I've been to towns where they've got good police.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.920]  You can instantly see they're good guys.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.280]  They're bearing how they act.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.621]  They're humble, but they're serious.
[00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:39.142]  These are thugs, in my view, just watching them.
[00:26:39.142 --> 00:26:42.303]  And then they go across, violate her Fourth Amendment, put it in.
[00:26:42.303 --> 00:26:44.724]  The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:44.724 --> 00:26:46.784]  It's so incredible.
[00:26:46.784 --> 00:26:49.165]  It's got to go viral.
[00:26:49.165 --> 00:26:56.167]  And her neighbor films it for her and their friends talking from the sidewalk.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.422]  And they're now charging her with... Well, I'll read the article in a moment.
[00:27:03.422 --> 00:27:09.244]  Here is just some of the audio for radio listeners and video for people watching us right now at InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:27:09.244 --> 00:27:10.545]  Here it is.
[00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:14.186]  Here's UPA installers crossing over locked fences.
[00:27:14.186 --> 00:27:16.487]  Climbing them over.
[00:27:16.487 --> 00:27:17.687]  Against consent.
[00:27:17.687 --> 00:27:19.107]  Bolt cutters.
[00:27:19.107 --> 00:27:22.929]  They are going onto people's properties with police.
[00:27:23.763 --> 00:27:25.504]  The permission, they are crossing.
[00:27:25.504 --> 00:27:26.085]  The permission?
[00:27:26.085 --> 00:27:28.447]  Well, the government's gone!
[00:27:28.447 --> 00:27:30.689]  Laura, do you give consent to have this smart meter installed?
[00:27:30.689 --> 00:27:31.549]  No, absolutely not.
[00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:33.791]  This is putting my child in harm's way.
[00:27:33.791 --> 00:27:40.356]  My child has a chronic illness, and it could affect her illness and make it worse, and I absolutely don't agree.
[00:27:40.356 --> 00:27:42.498]  Can you step away from the fence for a minute?
[00:27:42.498 --> 00:27:42.778]  Why?
[00:27:42.778 --> 00:27:46.161]  So I can get through?
[00:27:46.161 --> 00:27:51.405]  Okay, so police are now crossing locked fences without homeowners' consent.
[00:27:51.405 --> 00:27:52.226]  Just do whatever they want.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.580]  Laura, do you give consent?
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.521]  Those look like million dollar houses, actually.
[00:27:57.521 --> 00:27:59.161]  Maybe two million dollars.
[00:27:59.161 --> 00:28:03.022]  This is like a dictatorship.
[00:28:03.022 --> 00:28:04.142]  Guarantee these women are listeners.
[00:28:04.142 --> 00:28:06.163]  We're going to get them on.
[00:28:06.163 --> 00:28:08.523]  Officer, do you feel comfortable with what you're doing?
[00:28:08.523 --> 00:28:12.404]  No, she doesn't.
[00:28:12.404 --> 00:28:13.145]  We're already saying they're addicts.
[00:28:13.145 --> 00:28:14.845]  You should be putting smart meters on your house, ladies.
[00:28:14.845 --> 00:28:16.485]  So, Laura, you're the homeowner?
[00:28:16.485 --> 00:28:18.266]  Those two men that are on your property?
[00:28:18.266 --> 00:28:19.306]  They take what they want.
[00:28:19.306 --> 00:28:21.447]  They always do in history.
[00:28:21.447 --> 00:28:23.347]  Knowing that my daughter is chronically ill in this
[00:28:24.404 --> 00:28:25.365]  That's enough.
[00:28:25.365 --> 00:28:26.585]  The whole video's up there.
[00:28:26.585 --> 00:28:28.707]  There's a lot more of it.
[00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:30.748]  And you can go read the article here.
[00:28:30.748 --> 00:28:34.430]  The Chicago Tribune is very excited about wanting to put this woman in jail.
[00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.871]  Illinois, because that'll teach the slaves.
[00:28:35.871 --> 00:28:38.813]  Because, you know, people are part of the ruling class.
[00:28:38.813 --> 00:28:41.834]  This is like fun to rout us.
[00:28:41.834 --> 00:28:45.817]  It says, Illinois citizens still being arrested for filming police.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.121]  Despite court ruling which blocked unconstitutional law.
[00:28:50.121 --> 00:28:52.301]  So in your own property you don't film God.
[00:28:52.301 --> 00:29:03.024]  Illinois citizens are still being arrested for recording police officers despite a 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last year that blocked the enforcement of the law on the grounds that it was unconstitutional.
[00:29:03.024 --> 00:29:05.224]  They say public filming is eavesdropping.
[00:29:05.224 --> 00:29:08.305]  Following yesterday's story concerning residents of Naperville,
[00:29:09.486 --> 00:29:19.320]  Uh, who attempted to resist utility workers by speaking to them, invading their private property to install so-called smart meters, which have been linked with health issues.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.108]  It emerged that one of the refuseniks, Malia Kim Mandis, was arrested
[00:29:24.628 --> 00:29:27.990]  On attempted eavesdropping charges for recording police officers during the incident.
[00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.611]  They charge us from other stuff too.
[00:29:29.611 --> 00:29:44.340]  The irony of citizens being arrested for supposedly eavesdropping on cops in public where there is no expectation of privacy while simultaneously the government forcibly installs devices on people's property on record that do eavesdrop and spy on everything you're doing in your home is incredible.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.421]  We'll be right back with a lot more.
[00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:49.703]  It gets worse.
[00:29:49.703 --> 00:29:51.104]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.104 --> 00:29:52.605]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.613 --> 00:30:01.083]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:06.256]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says, fool me once,
[00:33:08.254 --> 00:33:11.036]  Shame on me.
[00:33:11.036 --> 00:33:11.876]  Shame on you.
[00:33:11.876 --> 00:33:15.078]  If you fool me, you can't get fooled again.
[00:33:15.078 --> 00:33:20.741]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:20.741 --> 00:33:22.482]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.288 --> 00:33:40.150]  Alright, we're going to be joined here in just a moment.
[00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:46.835]  He's sitting right next to me by Dr. Jerome Corsi, a WorldNetDaily best-selling author, worked with the State Department and other intelligence agencies.
[00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:59.165]  He can certainly speak to Benghazi and the whitewash there, incredible zones that Communist Chinese are setting up inside America, NAFTA and GATT, expanding the North American Union, the gun-grabbing that's going on.
[00:33:59.165 --> 00:34:01.867]  We're going to talk about all of it with him in just a moment.
[00:34:01.867 --> 00:34:02.668]  But first off,
[00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:05.430]  I said I would announce this a few weeks ago.
[00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:06.890]  I've just been too busy.
[00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:09.912]  But it is the biggest contest we've ever had.
[00:34:09.912 --> 00:34:10.992]  And it is for $115,000.
[00:34:10.992 --> 00:34:11.592]  Our new film contest.
[00:34:11.592 --> 00:34:11.652]  $115,000.
[00:34:11.652 --> 00:34:12.373]  First place, $100,000 cash prize.
[00:34:12.373 --> 00:34:12.893]  Second place, $10,000.
[00:34:12.893 --> 00:34:14.114]  Third place, $5,000.
[00:34:14.114 --> 00:34:18.576]  And then you will be in a pool in the running to have InfoWars.com and our news operation finance your film.
[00:34:31.261 --> 00:34:39.251]  Uh, to then put it out, not just on the internet for free like I've done with all my others, but what we've seen Dinesh D'Souza and others do, putting them in theaters.
[00:34:39.251 --> 00:34:41.373]  Now, I've always known how to do this.
[00:34:41.373 --> 00:34:46.659]  And it's not that I shrink from work, it's just that I know the model, I have a lot of Hollywood contacts, as people know.
[00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.522]  Uh, and so, that is going to be the plan.
[00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:55.366]  Now, they may shut everything down by then, but regardless, $100,000 sounds like a lot of money, and it is.
[00:34:55.366 --> 00:34:57.587]  The biggest contest out there is Doritos.
[00:34:57.587 --> 00:34:58.167]  It's $100,000.
[00:34:58.167 --> 00:35:01.269]  So this is the biggest contest next to Doritos.
[00:35:01.269 --> 00:35:03.150]  Twin Peaks up there.
[00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.731]  And with the other $15,000, it's the biggest.
[00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:10.374]  But for the bang for the buck, Liberty Films, that are put on YouTube,
[00:35:11.799 --> 00:35:15.763]  Whether they're three minutes or two hours, that's the rule, between three and two hours long.
[00:35:15.763 --> 00:35:20.608]  It can be history, it can be drama, it can be fiction, non-fiction, Agenda 21, Second Amendment, you name it.
[00:35:20.608 --> 00:35:23.851]  I'm going to talk about that at the bottom of the next hour when Dr. Courtsy leaves us.
[00:35:23.851 --> 00:35:32.900]  He's with us for the rest of the hour and then half of the next hour and I'll play the special video announcement that will be posted in the next 30 minutes or so up at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.022]  I'll play that four minute announcement
[00:35:35.763 --> 00:35:40.566]  For everybody up at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:40.566 --> 00:35:47.130]  So that press release and more coming in T-minus about 56 minutes from now.
[00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.752]  That will go live at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:35:50.752 --> 00:35:53.974]  Again, for $100,000 or $115,000, there'll probably be 500 films made.
[00:35:53.974 --> 00:35:57.577]  A couple hundred of them are going to be excellent.
[00:35:57.577 --> 00:35:59.858]  A few of them will be off the chart and it'll be a win-win.
[00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:03.200]  Everybody that enters is going to be a winner because you get the word out about the Globalist.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.141]  This is Operation
[00:36:05.425 --> 00:36:05.865]  All right.
[00:36:27.615 --> 00:36:29.996]  To be part of the production of three films a year.
[00:36:29.996 --> 00:36:32.417]  Big films and over a dozen smaller films.
[00:36:32.417 --> 00:36:35.018]  We plan to just put everything into this fight.
[00:36:35.018 --> 00:36:40.460]  So keep buying the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the ProPure water filters at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.900]  Keep supporting our sponsors.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:47.682]  Keep spreading the word because we're taking those Federal Reserve notes in and turning it right back against the enemy.
[00:36:47.682 --> 00:36:49.163]  Wars cost money.
[00:36:49.163 --> 00:36:55.845]  And the reason we've been so successful is we have history, we're dogged, we're focused, and we are putting the money back into the fight.
[00:36:56.745 --> 00:36:58.387]  Not into private jets.
[00:36:58.387 --> 00:37:01.451]  Okay, so that's what's happening here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:01.451 --> 00:37:06.196]  Now, Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us here in studio.
[00:37:06.196 --> 00:37:09.640]  He received a PhD from Harvard University in political science in 72.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.224]  He's also currently a senior staff reporter for WorldNetDaily.
[00:37:13.224 --> 00:37:17.729]  He's had a whole bunch of number one bestsellers like Unfit for Command and others.
[00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:21.891]  And, again, he's had five number one New York Times bestsellers, I guess.
[00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:23.032]  He's just amazing.
[00:37:23.032 --> 00:37:30.156]  And he also worked in security and other highly classified areas for the State Department and for unnamed intelligence agencies.
[00:37:30.156 --> 00:37:32.858]  And he joins us here to break down what's happening.
[00:37:32.858 --> 00:37:44.865]  Doc, before we get into Benghazi, before we get into Agenda 21, before we get into the total rush that's happening and Feinstein saying titles of nobility to government people to be exempt from gun laws even after they're out of office and police.
[00:37:45.365 --> 00:37:57.151]  Before we get into all of that, what do you make of airport terror announcements now in hotels, highway checkpoints here in Austin now looking for terrorists while the borders are wide open?
[00:37:57.151 --> 00:37:59.592]  I mean, they are really accelerating things.
[00:37:59.592 --> 00:38:00.432]  What's happening?
[00:38:00.432 --> 00:38:07.696]  Well, I think it's a whole clampdown, the whole decision by the government to get as much information on the populace as they can get.
[00:38:08.376 --> 00:38:13.418]  I mean, you gotta remember, it wasn't just the Nazis confiscated guns.
[00:38:13.418 --> 00:38:19.440]  The Nazis were experts in censuses and getting people to tell them what they owned, where it was.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:27.903]  When the Nazis came to take the Jews away, they could say, where is that bracelet you described in such and such a census?
[00:38:27.903 --> 00:38:29.684]  And you said you used to keep it in this drawer.
[00:38:29.684 --> 00:38:30.444]  Where is it now?
[00:38:31.164 --> 00:38:33.406]  I mean, it got down to that kind of specific information.
[00:38:33.406 --> 00:38:35.347]  Everyone just loves submitting.
[00:38:35.347 --> 00:38:41.091]  And submitting, people say, oh, we've got to fill out all these forms, we've got to do all these census reports.
[00:38:41.091 --> 00:38:45.233]  And by the way, Alex, I never worked as an employee of the government.
[00:38:45.233 --> 00:38:46.414]  I worked with these agents.
[00:38:46.414 --> 00:38:47.194]  You were a consultant.
[00:38:47.194 --> 00:38:47.715]  Consultant.
[00:38:48.055 --> 00:38:51.717]  I just wanted to make that clear so people didn't think I was misrepresenting anything I've done.
[00:38:51.717 --> 00:38:53.398]  I'm always precise on that.
[00:38:53.398 --> 00:38:55.860]  And you've worked in finance for some of the big outfits.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:01.803]  25 years in finance for banks around the world and still have all my securities and insurance licenses.
[00:39:01.803 --> 00:39:05.645]  Well, we know all the real agents actually aren't in the agencies.
[00:39:05.645 --> 00:39:09.308]  It's best not to be in the agencies.
[00:39:09.308 --> 00:39:12.870]  Look, the whole purpose right now is to collect information.
[00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:21.257]  My corporations, we just got forms coming from, I believe, the Census Bureau or the Commerce Department.
[00:39:21.257 --> 00:39:22.999]  All kinds of detailed information.
[00:39:22.999 --> 00:39:26.242]  My point was, you worked high level in the State Department in security.
[00:39:26.242 --> 00:39:28.624]  Tell folks, since we never brought that up, what you did do in that area.
[00:39:28.624 --> 00:39:34.649]  It was a period of time I was working with some top psychiatrists here in, actually in Dallas.
[00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:40.953]  And we went into the State Department and trained State Department personnel on hostage survival techniques.
[00:39:40.953 --> 00:39:45.436]  This was right after the takeover of the embassy in Tehran.
[00:39:45.436 --> 00:39:56.823]  I spent almost two years doing high-level work on survival of terrorist incidents and developed protocol for the State Department and the State Department employees around the world.
[00:39:57.563 --> 00:40:00.164]  A lot of that information is being used today.
[00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:08.047]  I developed a computer model that predicted the outcome of terrorist events, published it in an international journal of conflict resolution at Yale.
[00:40:08.047 --> 00:40:10.327]  My point is, you can really speak to Benghazi.
[00:40:10.327 --> 00:40:11.668]  That's why I brought all this up.
[00:40:11.668 --> 00:40:13.348]  I mean, we've even got General Boykin coming up.
[00:40:13.348 --> 00:40:14.209]  Let's get into that now.
[00:40:14.209 --> 00:40:18.050]  But Benghazi, I mean, first of all, the Benghazi issue is one that
[00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.194]  We have to first of all figure out what they were doing there.
[00:40:21.194 --> 00:40:30.527]  And what they were doing, as far as I can figure out, Stevens and the others, is they were... It was another kind of fast and furious operation, bringing weapons into Libya.
[00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:34.801]  With the ultimate intent, they were going to end up with Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:34.801 --> 00:40:37.584]  And a lot of those weapons today are ending up in Syria.
[00:40:37.584 --> 00:40:42.608]  Those same weapons, if we could track them, I would believe the weapons that were brought in by the U.S.
[00:40:42.608 --> 00:40:44.430]  government through Libya.
[00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.492]  Well, that's what the former head of special forces, Boykin, General Boykin, is saying.
[00:40:47.492 --> 00:40:49.274]  And I think some of them were used by the Mali.
[00:40:50.975 --> 00:40:53.397]  Al-Qaeda terrorists in that attack.
[00:40:53.397 --> 00:41:00.322]  But if we can find and track those weapons, you've got... Why would the State Department want... because they had a huge weapons cache at that safe house.
[00:41:00.322 --> 00:41:00.863]  Yes.
[00:41:00.863 --> 00:41:04.466]  And then why would for eight hours the White House be caught lying?
[00:41:04.466 --> 00:41:07.108]  We now know, order a stand-down.
[00:41:07.108 --> 00:41:09.750]  Were they trying to get rid of people after the transaction?
[00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:13.853]  Or was it a double-cross by the Al-Qaeda security they hired to run Benghazi?
[00:41:13.853 --> 00:41:17.395]  Well, see, first of all, I think there's so many games going on on this.
[00:41:17.395 --> 00:41:17.916]  First of all,
[00:41:18.496 --> 00:41:23.602]  Stevens, you remember, came into Benghazi when Qaddafi was in power.
[00:41:23.602 --> 00:41:26.826]  He came in through a cargo ship or something.
[00:41:26.826 --> 00:41:28.327]  He kind of snuck in.
[00:41:28.327 --> 00:41:28.988]  Tripoli.
[00:41:28.988 --> 00:41:29.449]  Tripoli.
[00:41:29.449 --> 00:41:30.710]  Came into Tripoli.
[00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:31.631]  Ended up in Benghazi.
[00:41:31.631 --> 00:41:32.913]  Yeah, the commando invasion.
[00:41:32.913 --> 00:41:37.838]  And was funding and providing weapons to eliminate Qaddafi.
[00:41:38.559 --> 00:41:47.384]  So these people who ended up killing Stevens were actually funded and gotten weapons to them and to their allies.
[00:41:47.384 --> 00:41:49.686]  But then now, see, Stevens is turning on them.
[00:41:49.686 --> 00:41:53.108]  We realize we're missing maybe a million weapons.
[00:41:53.108 --> 00:41:54.608]  We don't know where they are.
[00:41:54.608 --> 00:41:56.930]  And Stevens is trying to find out where those weapons are.
[00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.052]  Al-Qaeda was taking and shipping those weapons into Syria.
[00:42:00.712 --> 00:42:02.813]  We're beginning to find out these weapons are... Well, of course!
[00:42:02.813 --> 00:42:03.693]  The West wants that!
[00:42:03.693 --> 00:42:04.914]  They're running the whole attack!
[00:42:04.914 --> 00:42:09.276]  And, in fact, it's the same thing as we did in Fast and Furious.
[00:42:09.276 --> 00:42:10.636]  We provided the weapons.
[00:42:10.636 --> 00:42:13.557]  The weapons ended up in the hands of the gun cartels.
[00:42:13.557 --> 00:42:18.600]  Look, I just did this big expose on HSBC Bank.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:24.682]  HSBC Bank doing major money laundering for the Mexican drug cartels.
[00:42:24.682 --> 00:42:26.203]  They just paid something like a billion
[00:42:26.963 --> 00:42:27.343]  When I take $1,000 out
[00:42:49.555 --> 00:42:53.418]  Of the bank, they act suspicious and ask me what I'm doing, and I get in a big argument with them.
[00:42:53.418 --> 00:42:55.259]  It's none of your business.
[00:42:55.259 --> 00:42:57.620]  I mean, they won't even let Gerald Solente get $10,000 out.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:07.547]  The idea that we're preventing terrorism, and we're running the terrorist operation, they get the law to know everything about your business and collect the data.
[00:43:07.547 --> 00:43:18.734]  So just like Fast and Furious was to be blamed on the Second Amendment to take that away, they give Al-Qaeda all these missiles, let them take out the Syrians, then, oh, we got to take your rights because there's $10,000 each seeking missiles missing.
[00:43:18.974 --> 00:43:29.863]  Exactly, and we've got to make sure that, you know, we clamp down on guns in America, because look at the violent levels... And now they're saying Homeland Security is now for guns, not for Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:29.863 --> 00:43:34.486]  It's for the gun owners, it's for the libertarians, it's for the conservatives, it's for the returning veterans.
[00:43:34.486 --> 00:43:44.274]  Well, see, we're going to be defined as anyone who doesn't go along with the agenda, anyone who objects, anyone who raises questions, immediately you're on the suspect list.
[00:43:44.434 --> 00:43:45.355]  How do we respond to that?
[00:43:45.355 --> 00:43:52.159]  Because again, I mean, you've been there at the highest levels of the system, in banking and in consulting and everything.
[00:43:52.159 --> 00:43:54.940]  You've written books that brought down major presidential candidates.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.021]  You're a big insider.
[00:43:56.021 --> 00:43:59.703]  You don't say that, but let's just admit you are, Dr. Corsi, Jerome Corsi.
[00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:00.724]  Where are we going?
[00:44:00.724 --> 00:44:10.790]  Because I see this as a Vichy French sympathizer takeover, where the foreign banks are like the Vichy French, the generals stand down, they turn America over to it, and that's what I see.
[00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:13.991]  Well, first of all, Alex, you're doing a great job.
[00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:19.374]  And we at WND, we work with you, we support you, we think you're doing a great job.
[00:44:19.374 --> 00:44:21.215]  We're on the same team.
[00:44:21.215 --> 00:44:27.317]  The first job is you're exposing, you're calling the agenda, and you're opening people's eyes.
[00:44:27.317 --> 00:44:28.138]  So what is the agenda?
[00:44:28.138 --> 00:44:29.859]  I mean, do you concur with my analysis?
[00:44:29.859 --> 00:44:30.359]  Absolutely.
[00:44:30.359 --> 00:44:33.000]  The agenda is complete domination of the American people.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.161]  It's totalitarianism.
[00:44:34.821 --> 00:44:37.042]  And there's no doubt now, it's 100% naked.
[00:44:37.042 --> 00:44:42.564]  This is the left, it's most bald ever, running to the finish line.
[00:44:42.564 --> 00:44:45.465]  Yeah, I mean, every instinct I've got is get out of the country.
[00:44:45.465 --> 00:44:47.726]  They're saying, next we'll take your property.
[00:44:47.726 --> 00:44:52.128]  I mean, the whole agenda here, collectivism.
[00:44:52.128 --> 00:44:53.809]  You don't own that.
[00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:56.930]  You didn't build that.
[00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:57.830]  We own it.
[00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:59.571]  We need this to redistribute it.
[00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:02.512]  The whole plan of getting people out of their houses.
[00:45:02.512 --> 00:45:05.712]  Okay, well I studied the 1917 takeover as you have.
[00:45:05.712 --> 00:45:08.733]  From everything I know, they're using that plan.
[00:45:08.733 --> 00:45:09.953]  And I'm not just saying that for theatrics.
[00:45:09.953 --> 00:45:10.873]  You've got the floor.
[00:45:10.873 --> 00:45:12.194]  I want you to break that down.
[00:45:12.194 --> 00:45:16.815]  From everything I'm seeing, they're planning to try to start a civil war and call him Lincoln.
[00:45:16.815 --> 00:45:19.615]  It is always the same plan.
[00:45:19.615 --> 00:45:21.636]  The plan is, disarm the people.
[00:45:22.196 --> 00:45:25.777]  The plan is call the people the terrorists.
[00:45:25.777 --> 00:45:27.798]  Get information on the people.
[00:45:27.798 --> 00:45:28.918]  And then divide.
[00:45:28.918 --> 00:45:30.119]  Find out which is the group.
[00:45:30.119 --> 00:45:31.359]  Is it going to be the Jews?
[00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:32.860]  Who's it going to be this time?
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.961]  There's a scapegoat group that has to be collected.
[00:45:35.961 --> 00:45:38.182]  It's going to be the white militia.
[00:45:38.182 --> 00:45:39.102]  They're now saying that!
[00:45:39.102 --> 00:45:43.564]  It's going to be anyone white who still believes in Jesus Christ and professes
[00:45:44.324 --> 00:45:45.284]  You know, religion.
[00:45:45.284 --> 00:45:46.525]  Wow, they actually say that.
[00:45:46.525 --> 00:45:46.765]  Sure.
[00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:47.885]  It's in the manuals.
[00:45:47.885 --> 00:45:49.385]  This is the plan.
[00:45:49.385 --> 00:45:51.746]  This is the, these are the people that are going to march.
[00:45:51.746 --> 00:45:53.006]  No, no, no, no.
[00:45:53.006 --> 00:45:56.647]  The, the peers pressure thing article actually said, let them get ready.
[00:45:56.647 --> 00:45:57.728]  We're coming for you.
[00:45:57.728 --> 00:45:59.648]  And the communist Chinese are going to help.
[00:45:59.648 --> 00:46:01.609]  That's, that's, that's Newsweek.
[00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:05.370]  It says Newsweek on the byline is saying they're that confident.
[00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.471]  Well, look, the whole plan of the United States being bankrupt.
[00:46:08.471 --> 00:46:13.552]  I just wrote a short book on the Cloward Pivot Theory, that it's a plan to bankrupt the United States.
[00:46:13.732 --> 00:46:14.293]  Yeah!
[00:46:14.293 --> 00:46:25.705]  And with the Chinese owning as much of our debt as the Federal Reserve owns, they're one and two in competitors, China is saying already, we'll take equity instead of the debt.
[00:46:25.705 --> 00:46:27.326]  We'll manage your ports.
[00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:28.888]  We'll take land.
[00:46:28.888 --> 00:46:29.348]  We'll have
[00:46:30.049 --> 00:46:34.792]  Occupation zones within the United States that we create as free trade zones.
[00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:47.919]  I wrote an article this week in WND where China is buying oil rights in the United States that George W. Bush prevented China from doing with the UNICAL deal, saying it was a national security threat.
[00:46:48.843 --> 00:46:57.245]  Now, today, under Obama, China's signing left and right oil and natural gas deals, when we're still dependent on foreign oil.
[00:46:57.245 --> 00:47:01.767]  He won't let us develop, does everything he can to block it, while giving huge swaths of the China.
[00:47:01.767 --> 00:47:07.468]  China just bought the biggest oil fields in Texas, hundreds of thousands of different acres.
[00:47:07.468 --> 00:47:10.049]  I can drive 20 miles and show you Chinese-owned areas.
[00:47:10.049 --> 00:47:17.011]  And China just made a big deal, bought one of the major companies in Canada, which owns rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:19.754]  In US territory.
[00:47:19.754 --> 00:47:22.877]  China is going to own and operate those rigs.
[00:47:22.877 --> 00:47:32.889]  China is going to be, essentially, producing oil out of resources while we're buying oil and natural gas, especially oil, on foreign markets.
[00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:34.691]  It makes no sense at all.
[00:47:34.691 --> 00:47:42.314]  Why are we buying foreign oil and letting the Chinese... Well, because, again, the plan... That's why they gave them the Panama Canal?
[00:47:42.314 --> 00:47:44.235]  That's why they gave them all the industry?
[00:47:44.235 --> 00:47:46.696]  That's why... I mean, this is so diabolical!
[00:47:46.696 --> 00:47:48.437]  Take a look at this little e-book I wrote.
[00:47:48.437 --> 00:47:50.438]  I wrote two e-books I think are very important.
[00:47:50.438 --> 00:48:01.242]  One is on Saul Alinsky, the evil genius behind Obama, and the second was on the Coward Pivot Theory, which is the plan, Obama's plan, to bankrupt the United States.
[00:48:01.242 --> 00:48:02.103]  That's what it's called.
[00:48:02.583 --> 00:48:17.381]  These two sociologists came up with the conclusion the only way to transform America into a socialist state was to bring it to its knees economically by overloading the welfare of the welfare state with obligations that could not be met.
[00:48:17.381 --> 00:48:17.902]  That's the plan!
[00:48:18.823 --> 00:48:20.284]  Look at the Daily Beast article.
[00:48:20.284 --> 00:48:23.606]  It says we need the communist Chinese government to tell us what to do.
[00:48:23.606 --> 00:48:24.867]  This is globalism.
[00:48:24.867 --> 00:48:29.851]  We've got to get Americans ready to have our TV foreign-owned like current TV.
[00:48:29.851 --> 00:48:32.853]  Somewhere Alex Jones is readying his flamethrower.
[00:48:32.853 --> 00:48:33.453]  Let him.
[00:48:33.453 --> 00:48:40.358]  And they go on to say we're going to use the minorities and basically racial division and we're going to use women.
[00:48:40.358 --> 00:48:44.020]  They're actually admitting what Rush Limbaugh finally said yesterday.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.821]  They want a race war in this country.
[00:48:45.821 --> 00:48:48.063]  Look at how the campaign was run.
[00:48:48.463 --> 00:48:51.645]  Obama ran a race war campaign.
[00:48:51.645 --> 00:48:52.926]  Saul Alinsky.
[00:48:52.926 --> 00:48:55.808]  You know, the rich are not paying their fair share.
[00:48:55.808 --> 00:48:59.350]  So you flame the economic resentment.
[00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:04.714]  Get all the minorities to feel, you know, the white majority has stolen your money.
[00:49:04.714 --> 00:49:09.257]  And have Obama raise taxes on poor people so they're hurting even worse.
[00:49:09.257 --> 00:49:11.438]  Well, and again, it's part of the plan to bankrupt everyone.
[00:49:11.438 --> 00:49:12.459]  Yeah, exactly!
[00:49:12.459 --> 00:49:16.742]  Because under the lie that he wasn't going to raise taxes, he did raise taxes.
[00:49:17.922 --> 00:49:20.043]  87% of the workers in the country.
[00:49:20.043 --> 00:49:20.543]  Exactly.
[00:49:20.543 --> 00:49:21.584]  It's so diabolical.
[00:49:21.584 --> 00:49:22.684]  It is so diabolical.
[00:49:22.684 --> 00:49:23.664]  Lying, lying all day.
[00:49:23.664 --> 00:49:24.565]  So how do we stop them?
[00:49:24.565 --> 00:49:27.646]  Because, I mean, this is a real Soviet-style takeover.
[00:49:27.646 --> 00:49:32.627]  Yes, in fact... Congressman Brown just came out and said Obama only is faithful to the Soviet Constitution.
[00:49:32.627 --> 00:49:36.549]  In fact, go back and ask, what has Obama done for the African-Americans?
[00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:39.250]  Look at the unemployment rate among African-Americans.
[00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.930]  What has he done... They've been hurt the worst!
[00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:41.451]  The worst.
[00:49:41.451 --> 00:49:44.131]  Look, what has he done for the youth who have voted for him?
[00:49:44.131 --> 00:49:45.332]  Highest unemployment rate.
[00:49:45.832 --> 00:49:50.836]  The slimmest chances of jobs of any generation that we've ever had in America.
[00:49:50.836 --> 00:49:55.300]  These are the Obama zombies that in common... And he re-legalized U.S.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:01.104]  funding for basically forced abortions in China, where they give the women money if they get aborted.
[00:50:01.104 --> 00:50:05.788]  And kill the babies, left and right, forced women to have abortions in China.
[00:50:05.788 --> 00:50:11.653]  China, look, you go try to bring a Bible and profess the religion of Jesus Christ in China, you'll be in prison.
[00:50:12.849 --> 00:50:18.511]  But I mean, Doc, even though I know all this stuff, we're going to break, I can't believe it's really happening.
[00:50:18.511 --> 00:50:22.352]  The Bank of China has had meetings with the United States government.
[00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:29.753]  The plan is set for China to transfer its debt into equity, own parts of the United States, manage... That's official!
[00:50:29.753 --> 00:50:30.414]  It's official.
[00:50:30.414 --> 00:50:31.274]  The meetings have happened.
[00:50:31.274 --> 00:50:34.215]  That's why they said in the People's Daily a month ago, you will take the guns!
[00:50:34.215 --> 00:50:35.395]  The meetings have happened.
[00:50:35.855 --> 00:50:38.137]  So they want the property, they know we're going to fight.
[00:50:38.137 --> 00:50:41.280]  China wants to disarm the United States before this plan is implemented.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:44.063]  We are being conquered by the globalists leveraging China.
[00:50:44.063 --> 00:50:44.523]  Absolutely.
[00:50:44.523 --> 00:50:47.606]  China wants us to have no weapons.
[00:50:47.606 --> 00:50:51.089]  I mean, this is so... I want to talk about the military.
[00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:52.330]  It's a plan.
[00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:53.951]  The Collard-Piven theory.
[00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:55.873]  Obama's plan to bankrupt America.
[00:50:55.873 --> 00:50:58.335]  A Soviet globalist commie plan.
[00:50:58.335 --> 00:50:58.756]  We'll be back.
[00:51:00.672 --> 00:51:09.296]  If you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators, but were waiting for an offer so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[00:51:09.296 --> 00:51:10.117]  Here's why.
[00:51:10.117 --> 00:51:13.378]  Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:51:13.378 --> 00:51:20.082]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.
[00:51:20.082 --> 00:51:23.523]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[00:51:23.523 --> 00:51:24.544]  Now here's the best part.
[00:51:25.024 --> 00:51:29.811]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[00:51:29.811 --> 00:51:35.679]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of each year.
[00:51:35.679 --> 00:51:39.685]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[00:51:39.685 --> 00:51:41.948]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty.
[00:51:42.068 --> 00:51:44.809]  And special bonuses you just won't believe.
[00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:46.450]  Don't wait, they go fast.
[00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.150]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com.
[00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:50.351]  That's scratchanddentsolar.com.

[00:52:01.795 --> 00:52:04.536]  Feeling like there are too many pressures and demands on you?
[00:52:04.536 --> 00:52:07.017]  Losing sleep worrying about tests and schoolwork?
[00:52:07.017 --> 00:52:09.358]  Leaving on the run because your schedule is just too busy?
[00:52:10.413 --> 00:52:14.395]  You may be under too much stress and it may be affecting your mind.
[00:52:14.395 --> 00:52:19.877]  Get your mental edge back with Nootropic Mind Power from MindRegard.com.
[00:52:19.877 --> 00:52:24.119]  Nootropic Mind Power is not a drug, but a natural supplement.
[00:52:24.119 --> 00:52:30.082]  Its 12 powerful ingredients are natural and non-GMO, plus it's gluten-free, wheat-free,
[00:52:30.362 --> 00:52:30.942]  We're good to go!
[00:52:59.966 --> 00:53:02.247]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[00:53:02.247 --> 00:53:03.188]  Answer this.
[00:53:03.188 --> 00:53:15.475]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?
[00:53:16.716 --> 00:53:18.877]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:53:18.877 --> 00:53:25.099]  This year about one in every 50 US homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually picking the easy target.
[00:53:25.099 --> 00:53:27.680]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:35.722]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:53:35.722 --> 00:53:38.683]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[00:53:38.683 --> 00:53:39.144]  And for only $34.95,
[00:53:40.464 --> 00:53:45.765]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:53:45.765 --> 00:53:50.906]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:53:50.906 --> 00:53:56.807]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com.
[00:53:56.807 --> 00:54:00.848]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:00.848 --> 00:54:04.409]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:18.952]  Folks, the reason I keep talking about since yesterday this Pierce Pressure article that came out January 21st, I didn't see until the 24th.
[00:54:20.296 --> 00:54:22.398]  Is that I haven't had time to read it on air yet.
[00:54:22.398 --> 00:54:31.305]  And it says, yeah, we're getting rid of America, we're getting rid of sovereignty, you know, we're going under globalization, new world order, and the gun owners are going to have to turn their guns in.
[00:54:31.305 --> 00:54:35.188]  And, you know, the communist Chinese, thank God other governments are going to help.
[00:54:35.188 --> 00:54:41.853]  I mean, it's everything I saw in the Weatherman trials, going back and seeing the old footage where they plan to bring in the Chinese and all this.
[00:54:41.853 --> 00:54:42.934]  It sounds crazy.
[00:54:42.934 --> 00:54:44.075]  Here we are 30, 40 years later.
[00:54:45.376 --> 00:54:46.877]  And they're really going to try it.
[00:54:46.877 --> 00:54:49.780]  And I believe they're going to fail, but there's going to be a civil war.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.822]  Ron Paul agreed last week with us on air.
[00:54:52.822 --> 00:54:53.643]  Countless others.
[00:54:53.643 --> 00:54:54.624]  Every analyst I've talked to.
[00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:59.347]  Let me ask you that, Dr. Corsi, bestselling author here in studio with us.
[00:54:59.347 --> 00:55:01.089]  A. How are things going for them?
[00:55:01.089 --> 00:55:02.270]  They're teamed up with China.
[00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:04.031]  That much is clear.
[00:55:04.031 --> 00:55:07.414]  Do you think they're able to actually execute this?
[00:55:07.414 --> 00:55:08.535]  How do we defeat them?
[00:55:08.535 --> 00:55:09.536]  What is the time frame?
[00:55:09.536 --> 00:55:12.618]  Well, first of all, exposing them is critical.
[00:55:12.618 --> 00:55:14.359]  What you're doing every day is critical.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.781]  Uh, the time frame is now.
[00:55:16.781 --> 00:55:17.521]  It's immediate.
[00:55:17.521 --> 00:55:21.764]  The plan to bankrupt America is ongoing today.
[00:55:21.764 --> 00:55:25.786]  Cloward-Piven theory is in... $22 billion to ship General Motors overseas?
[00:55:25.786 --> 00:55:28.508]  You've got to read the Cloward-Piven theory.
[00:55:28.508 --> 00:55:30.049]  I wrote it out in this little e-book.
[00:55:30.749 --> 00:55:44.181]  And it explains you bankrupt the United States by overloading welfare with demands that welfare can never meet, including Obamacare, including, wait till, take the student tuitions and forgive all those loans.
[00:55:44.181 --> 00:55:45.442]  It's all designed to bankrupt.
[00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:46.563]  All designed to bankrupt.
[00:55:47.023 --> 00:55:48.203]  China has had meetings.
[00:55:48.203 --> 00:55:50.024]  China wants assets.
[00:55:50.024 --> 00:55:53.624]  And see, the New World Order people say, well, China's the future.
[00:55:53.624 --> 00:55:53.864]  Why?
[00:55:53.864 --> 00:56:00.866]  Because China's communist, but they combine capitalism under communism in a model... And the elites are exempt!
[00:56:00.866 --> 00:56:02.726]  And the elites are exempt.
[00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:08.107]  The elites get to lead a privileged life with weapons, go into any federal building.
[00:56:08.107 --> 00:56:08.747]  What do you find?
[00:56:08.747 --> 00:56:10.127]  You find armed guards.
[00:56:10.127 --> 00:56:12.208]  You go through metal detectors.
[00:56:12.208 --> 00:56:13.568]  All your property is searched.
[00:56:14.288 --> 00:56:24.474]  The federal government's going to be well protected and they're going to have weapons everywhere, but they're going to take our weapons because China does not want to take over the United States with an armed citizen.
[00:56:24.474 --> 00:56:25.675]  It's unbelievable.
[00:56:25.675 --> 00:56:34.700]  And they're planning to just have a slow-motion Red Dawn with all the info and give China tax incentives, as they've announced, in these free trade zones where no one can compete.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:38.542]  Look, I've heard about, you've even got Governor Perry back with Sintra.
[00:56:39.102 --> 00:56:41.886]  Rebuilding the parts of the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:56:41.886 --> 00:56:42.747]  That was Superhighway.
[00:56:42.747 --> 00:56:45.410]  Superhighways are coming back in with toll roads.
[00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:46.932]  They're under the radar.
[00:56:46.932 --> 00:56:48.354]  They signed something like $20 billion.
[00:56:48.354 --> 00:56:50.056]  Everything is to bankrupt.
[00:56:50.056 --> 00:56:51.178]  How is it going for them?
[00:56:51.178 --> 00:56:55.102]  It's done incrementally, so you can't see that it's happening in little pieces.
[00:56:55.663 --> 00:56:57.504]  It's going well.
[00:56:57.504 --> 00:56:58.544]  Obama re-elected.
[00:56:58.544 --> 00:57:01.626]  They've got a socialist agenda set out.
[00:57:01.626 --> 00:57:03.746]  They've got the Republicans on the run.
[00:57:03.746 --> 00:57:10.229]  What's going to stop them is the Second Amendment and the American people finally waking up and saying no.
[00:57:10.229 --> 00:57:12.030]  And Alex, you're playing a big role in this.
[00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:14.292]  Every day getting the information.
[00:57:14.292 --> 00:57:18.317]  We at WND, every day getting the information in front of the people.
[00:57:18.317 --> 00:57:19.198]  The truth.
[00:57:19.198 --> 00:57:21.921]  Look, I just wrote about the fact of oil.
[00:57:21.921 --> 00:57:26.366]  We are selling to the Chinese oil rights throughout the United States.
[00:57:26.366 --> 00:57:26.807]  For nothing!
[00:57:27.227 --> 00:57:28.147]  For nothing.
[00:57:28.147 --> 00:57:29.748]  And George W. Bush would not.
[00:57:29.748 --> 00:57:33.249]  Remember, UNICAL was going to be taken over by I think 2005.
[00:57:33.249 --> 00:57:35.069]  And that's what government land is all about.
[00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:36.910]  So they can just give it away.
[00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:46.592]  I remember 15 years ago reading about the UN World Heritage sites where they admitted the buffer zones, hundreds of thousands of square miles around it, was being pledged for the national debt.
[00:57:46.592 --> 00:57:47.472]  And who owns the debt?
[00:57:47.472 --> 00:57:49.093]  China wants to manage the ports.
[00:57:49.853 --> 00:57:52.054]  China wants to manage the ports.
[00:57:52.054 --> 00:57:54.135]  They're managing the ports right now.
[00:57:54.135 --> 00:57:55.256]  No, that's the deal.
[00:57:55.256 --> 00:58:06.021]  We'll use your dollars for slave goods our slaves make with suicide nets around the factories, but you give us the Long Beach and the Panama Canal and the infrastructure and the oil.
[00:58:06.021 --> 00:58:07.582]  Panama Canal, China is.
[00:58:07.582 --> 00:58:09.083]  They're managing everything.
[00:58:09.083 --> 00:58:09.543]  Everything.
[00:58:09.543 --> 00:58:10.623]  Manzanilla.
[00:58:10.623 --> 00:58:13.545]  They're ready to manage Los Angeles and they want
[00:58:14.005 --> 00:58:18.748]  Free trade zones in the United States where communist Chinese can come in and set up business.
[00:58:18.748 --> 00:58:19.768]  This is a takeover.
[00:58:19.768 --> 00:58:20.569]  It's a takeover.
[00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:22.650]  It's a step-by-step takeover.
[00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:23.951]  And it's happening.
[00:58:23.951 --> 00:58:29.274]  And our debt is giving China the leverage they need to demand assets.
[00:58:29.274 --> 00:58:35.137]  And in the global issues, our military, what's left of it, has the leverage point to keep the commie Chinese in line.
[00:58:35.137 --> 00:58:36.318]  We don't have to have a military.
[00:58:36.318 --> 00:58:37.298]  China has one.
[00:58:37.298 --> 00:58:37.919]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:43.174 --> 00:58:50.578]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.578 --> 00:58:54.559]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[00:58:54.559 --> 00:59:02.083]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[00:59:02.083 --> 00:59:04.764]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[00:59:04.764 --> 00:59:11.367]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[00:59:11.367 --> 00:59:12.508]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[00:59:12.788 --> 00:59:21.818]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[00:59:21.818 --> 00:59:25.783]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[00:59:25.783 --> 00:59:27.645]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.
[00:59:27.845 --> 00:59:30.147]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:55.938]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.938 --> 01:00:05.305]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:06.626]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:08.387]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.387 --> 01:00:10.149]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.730]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:13.271]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.271 --> 01:00:17.474]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:21.557]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.968 --> 01:00:30.729]  Big things afoot here in Texas.
[01:00:30.729 --> 01:00:33.850]  You know, Dr. Corsi, I'm noticing there's like a gathering in Texas.
[01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:38.851]  It's also happening in other states like New Hampshire, but everybody is really moving to Texas.
[01:00:38.851 --> 01:00:43.332]  And the globalists see Texas as the resistance to their new world order takeover.
[01:00:43.332 --> 01:00:48.754]  And I know they've got to get the guns, but I think as the founders said, you won't need the Second Amendment until they try to take it.
[01:00:48.754 --> 01:00:53.756]  As Thomas Jefferson said, elaborate on what you mean by the Second Amendment is going to save us.
[01:00:53.756 --> 01:00:56.777]  And you were telling me during the break, people are finally starting to get it.
[01:00:56.777 --> 01:00:58.017]  This has been great banter we're having.
[01:00:58.137 --> 01:01:02.619]  Well, I think, first of all, the broadcast you're doing, we're at WND getting the word out.
[01:01:02.619 --> 01:01:06.502]  People are understanding that, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:01:06.502 --> 01:01:07.402]  It's not a conspiracy.
[01:01:07.402 --> 01:01:12.805]  It's a conscious plan to bankrupt the United States, conscious plan to take away our freedoms.
[01:01:12.805 --> 01:01:15.587]  You get the Patriot Act coming in after 9-11.
[01:01:15.587 --> 01:01:22.370]  You get now the, you know, terrorism is expanding, so we've got to be able to take guns away, school killings.
[01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:24.912]  All these fear elements end up in taking
[01:01:25.612 --> 01:01:30.355]  Fundamental rights from the American people while we're being indebted to China.
[01:01:30.355 --> 01:01:32.457]  And China wants the assets.
[01:01:32.457 --> 01:01:39.222]  The New World Order people, communist socialists, say China's the future because China is communist.
[01:01:39.222 --> 01:01:43.004]  But they've figured out, you know, the Obama people... Well, they're really just slave masters.
[01:01:43.004 --> 01:01:43.485]  Capitalism.
[01:01:43.485 --> 01:01:44.485]  They're slave masters.
[01:01:44.485 --> 01:01:44.966]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:44.966 --> 01:01:46.487]  Communism for the slaves.
[01:01:46.487 --> 01:01:47.768]  Palaces for the controllers.
[01:01:47.768 --> 01:01:48.048]  Precisely.
[01:01:48.188 --> 01:01:51.770]  I mean, Obama gets multi-million dollar vacations.
[01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:55.253]  Ten million dollar vacations, red carpets, they're the new Hollywood!
[01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:58.895]  And celebrities, and so does Nancy Pelosi.
[01:01:58.895 --> 01:02:05.199]  You go to a federal building, you're going to have to go through a metal detector, your property's going to be looked at.
[01:02:05.199 --> 01:02:09.002]  They're all going to be protected, the federal government, by guns and weapons.
[01:02:09.002 --> 01:02:11.523]  And by the way, they're not part of Obamacare.
[01:02:11.523 --> 01:02:14.085]  Nobody in the Senate and the House is part of Obamacare.
[01:02:14.085 --> 01:02:16.827]  Nobody in the Senate and the House will be part of any gun restrictions.
[01:02:17.347 --> 01:02:24.291]  When China comes in, China comes in, and the Trans-Texas Corridor was the first salvo in this.
[01:02:24.291 --> 01:02:28.774]  And out of it, look, China is still managing the Panama Canal.
[01:02:28.774 --> 01:02:33.037]  They're managing these ports in Mexico, like Lazaro Cardenas in Manzanilla.
[01:02:33.037 --> 01:02:34.477]  China wants ports.
[01:02:34.477 --> 01:02:37.439]  The Bank of China has met with the federal government.
[01:02:37.439 --> 01:02:41.702]  They've said, we want assets now for our debt.
[01:02:42.662 --> 01:02:57.112]  And the Cloward-Piven theory drives this, because the Cloward-Piven, two sociologists, who had a plan, they bankrupt New York in the 70s with this idea, overloading welfare, so capitalism crashes.
[01:02:57.112 --> 01:03:02.495]  You blame capitalism, you reconstruct socialism, let the Chinese come in and show us how to do it.
[01:03:02.495 --> 01:03:05.117]  The Chinese understand capitalism the way it works.
[01:03:05.777 --> 01:03:08.098]  And we're just being prepared for it.
[01:03:08.098 --> 01:03:13.500]  The discussion today in the Senate about guns is to sensitize people.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.021]  Remember, same-sex marriage.
[01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:18.201]  20 years ago, people were offended.
[01:03:18.201 --> 01:03:20.442]  Now everybody's desensitized.
[01:03:20.442 --> 01:03:22.083]  The same with a gun takeover.
[01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:27.644]  You introduce the idea, you show all these schools.
[01:03:27.644 --> 01:03:28.604]  You want to protect the schools?
[01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:29.965]  Put armed guards in them.
[01:03:29.965 --> 01:03:32.245]  That's what they do in the federal buildings.
[01:03:32.245 --> 01:03:35.906]  Federal buildings are not no-gun zones.
[01:03:35.906 --> 01:03:40.547]  The federal troops have federal officers in every House and Senate building.
[01:03:40.547 --> 01:03:43.628]  But how do you beat it when they've got all the illegal aliens voting and everything?
[01:03:43.868 --> 01:03:56.356]  What they don't have is they, you've got the people of the United States, those left in America who understand that the Founding Fathers created... We have to get aggressive and realize how much trouble we're in and go after them politically, legally.
[01:03:56.356 --> 01:03:58.017]  People have got to make this a full-time deal.
[01:03:58.017 --> 01:03:59.218]  And take it seriously.
[01:03:59.218 --> 01:04:00.218]  Yeah, this isn't a joke.
[01:04:00.218 --> 01:04:00.879]  It's not a joke.
[01:04:00.879 --> 01:04:03.541]  I mean, this is now when, you know, pre-prepared.
[01:04:04.301 --> 01:04:08.387]  You know, all these, the census data, the data about filling out all this information.
[01:04:08.387 --> 01:04:09.969]  The smart meters watching everything you're doing.
[01:04:09.969 --> 01:04:12.933]  They're collecting data right now to know where everything is.
[01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:17.038]  So when they come to get the guns, they all say, well give us the one you've got in that closet.
[01:04:17.038 --> 01:04:18.240]  You registered it.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.441]  We know you've got it.
[01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:19.962]  Hand it over.
[01:04:20.776 --> 01:04:26.081]  You know, this is where the information... And they know when people fight back, then it'll be, oh, there's a new terrorist threat.
[01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:28.103]  All we want to do is register the guns.
[01:04:28.103 --> 01:04:29.245]  What's wrong with that?
[01:04:29.245 --> 01:04:31.187]  Well, as soon as you've registered... Then they take them.
[01:04:31.187 --> 01:04:32.007]  They know where they are.
[01:04:32.007 --> 01:04:33.309]  They go, but you can keep your bolt-action.
[01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:35.371]  Now Australia's banning bolt-action.
[01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:37.773]  Well, and again, what's an assault rifle?
[01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:40.276]  Well, an assault rifle's gonna be anything they decide is an assault rifle.
[01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:42.638]  That's why they're now saying, oh, it's handguns, too, we're gonna ban.
[01:04:42.638 --> 01:04:44.180]  Anything you want is an assault rifle.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:49.722]  And again, the Second Amendment was designed for this very situation.
[01:04:49.722 --> 01:04:53.804]  Stay there, we gotta talk about what the Second Amendment was designed for with Dr. Jerome Corsi coming up.
[01:04:53.804 --> 01:04:58.226]  And then we'll get into all the other huge issues taking place right now.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.801]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:06.021]  Don't be one of them!

[01:08:11.869 --> 01:08:13.411]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.411 --> 01:08:17.617]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.617 --> 01:08:21.662]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.803 --> 01:08:26.144]  Again, it's Friday, the 25th day of January, 2013.
[01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:34.207]  We've got Dr. Jerome Corsi here with us for another 25 minutes or so, and then he's got to leave and get on an airplane.
[01:08:34.207 --> 01:08:35.908]  Again, he is a Ph.D.
[01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:48.413]  from Harvard University in political science, worked with the State Department and other agencies in highly classified areas as a consultant, and of course has written five New York Times best-selling non-fiction books, many of them number one.
[01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:53.144]  And he writes for World Net Daily and he's got a bunch of e-books out right now.
[01:08:53.144 --> 01:08:58.668]  And yes, there are a lot of different sociologists, and that's how communists operate during the infiltration phase.
[01:08:58.668 --> 01:09:01.871]  Because they want to bankrupt things, then blame free market.
[01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:04.793]  And they get so many dependents they can take over.
[01:09:04.793 --> 01:09:06.514]  Now, Doc, we've had great banner.
[01:09:06.514 --> 01:09:08.536]  Everybody's saying, you know, powerful radio earlier.
[01:09:10.217 --> 01:09:36.739]  I want to be able to now just sit back and have you recap everything you've said, that this is the global mega-banks, anti-free market, with the socialists and the communists, to recap last hour, leveraging with the communist Chinese, using limited capitalism, where they exempt themselves from the rules, basically modern slavery, to take over, and how we beat them and what we're facing and how they use the drugs, how the big banks are behind that, you wanted to talk about that.
[01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:38.200]  I'm going to just sit back now, you've got the floor.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.381]  Well, I mean, there's so many.
[01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:41.742]  First of all, I want to start out with the Second Amendment.
[01:09:41.742 --> 01:09:43.683]  I want to say this about the Second Amendment.
[01:09:43.683 --> 01:09:46.404]  The Second Amendment was written for a time like this.
[01:09:46.404 --> 01:09:52.647]  It was written for a time, you know, Revolutionary War was when the British were taking everything over.
[01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:55.469]  British making a final play to dominate the colonies.
[01:09:55.469 --> 01:09:59.491]  And the militias then at that point, people being armed, were critical.
[01:09:59.491 --> 01:10:04.453]  An armed public today, the Second Amendment is a powerful tool.
[01:10:04.453 --> 01:10:05.694]  It's why it's being attacked.
[01:10:06.394 --> 01:10:07.755]  It's critical to maintain.
[01:10:07.755 --> 01:10:12.279]  Now, the next thing I want to say is, look, and Alex, we are the drug cartels.
[01:10:12.279 --> 01:10:18.125]  The government of the United States, you got the NSA, which is reading everybody's emails.
[01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:29.815]  Now, you mean to say, and I showed and published with John Cruz, the whistleblower, the information about HSBC money laundering, money coming from the drug cartels.
[01:10:29.815 --> 01:10:31.417]  That has to happen with the U.S.
[01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:32.518]  government knowing about it.
[01:10:32.918 --> 01:10:55.140]  You mean Treasury, Federal Reserve, NSA, CIA didn't know that Mexican drug launderers were driving into Tijuana with a truckload of $100 bills, sitting in the high net worth area, you know, drinking espresso while that's being processed into the bank and shoveled all over the world on behalf of the drug cartels.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.561]  We facilitated that.
[01:10:56.701 --> 01:11:04.303]  I've talked to the Air Force and Army officers who sit there with the surveillance blimps and the aircraft, and they're told, let that through, let that, stop that.
[01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:12.885]  Why do we have more heroin coming out of Afghanistan today than when the Taliban ran Afghanistan?
[01:11:12.885 --> 01:11:15.626]  Again, we are the drug cartels.
[01:11:15.626 --> 01:11:17.086]  We are the gun runners of the world.
[01:11:18.021 --> 01:11:20.663]  Fast and Furious was just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:11:20.663 --> 01:11:27.569]  You mean guns are being run worldwide and the NSA and the CIA doesn't know what's happening and can't catch anybody?
[01:11:27.569 --> 01:11:28.810]  It's nonsense!
[01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:31.813]  Drug cartels penetrating into the United States.
[01:11:31.813 --> 01:11:37.238]  You mean we're able to sell billions of dollars, I'd say the drug business may be a trillion dollar business.
[01:11:37.238 --> 01:11:37.898]  It is.
[01:11:37.898 --> 01:11:42.663]  To drug addicts in the streets of Colorado and every other city of America and
[01:11:43.243 --> 01:11:46.544]  You know, the CIA and the FBI can't find them?
[01:11:46.544 --> 01:11:54.006]  Well, I mean, Wells Fargo with Warren Buffett got caught laundering $307.8 billion two years ago with Wachovia.
[01:11:54.006 --> 01:11:59.287]  The major profits, I think, today being made in the banking system worldwide come from money laundering.
[01:11:59.287 --> 01:12:03.788]  The money laundering laws that are out there are not to catch the drug cartels.
[01:12:03.788 --> 01:12:05.208]  They're to harass us.
[01:12:05.208 --> 01:12:10.790]  They basically permit the federal government to track everything you're doing in the bank, where your money is.
[01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:12.510]  Make sure you're not using any cash.
[01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:20.197]  The catch, who's being caught with the Patriot Act are legitimate citizens who just do one or two things wrong.
[01:12:20.197 --> 01:12:20.777]  No, no, no.
[01:12:20.777 --> 01:12:30.666]  I know someone in Texas who has a successful business, no criminal record, and over two decades had saved up a couple hundred thousand dollars in cash, went to put it back in the bank.
[01:12:30.666 --> 01:12:31.827]  They'll be harassed.
[01:12:31.827 --> 01:12:32.468]  I was arrested.
[01:12:32.768 --> 01:12:34.109]  Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:12:34.109 --> 01:12:38.152]  And see, but yet you come into Tijuana with a truckload of $100 bills.
[01:12:38.152 --> 01:12:40.754]  Hey, you're a preferred customer.
[01:12:40.754 --> 01:12:43.176]  And that money is going to pass right through the entire system.
[01:12:43.176 --> 01:12:44.957]  It's going to come through banks.
[01:12:44.957 --> 01:12:48.680]  HSBC was money laundering in Long Island.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:58.247]  We had the data, stealing people's social security numbers, creating false accounts, running millions of dollars through these false accounts, closing the accounts.
[01:12:59.068 --> 01:13:00.829]  So there was no trace of them.
[01:13:00.829 --> 01:13:18.923]  We turned the information, John Cruz, the whistleblower, I wrote about it in WND, we went into the Department of Homeland Security in New York, turned over this information, turned it over to the Congress, and nobody was doing anything until we started publicizing it, writing the articles about it, exposing it.
[01:13:18.923 --> 01:13:25.188]  I've exposed HSBC in India, all around the world HSBC is a criminal bank.
[01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:27.708]  It's engaging in these activities.
[01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:31.851]  And if HSBC wants to sue me, hey, I'll save them the problem.
[01:13:31.851 --> 01:13:32.792]  But I mean, wait a minute.
[01:13:32.792 --> 01:13:33.773]  It's in the news.
[01:13:33.773 --> 01:13:37.295]  It's in the news that all the big Federal Reserve member banks and others have been caught.
[01:13:37.295 --> 01:13:38.936]  They're laundering money.
[01:13:38.936 --> 01:13:40.077]  They are laundering.
[01:13:40.077 --> 01:13:42.179]  It's the only way the drug business can operate.
[01:13:42.179 --> 01:13:44.520]  That's why they keep it illegal, to keep the price up.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.583]  You can't have a drug business if the governments don't cooperate.
[01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:50.225]  It's the same with the guns.
[01:13:50.945 --> 01:13:52.806]  The guns are the same.
[01:13:52.806 --> 01:13:57.108]  Guns are being... The federal government wants a monopoly on the weapons.
[01:13:57.108 --> 01:13:59.829]  So that they can put the weapons where they want.
[01:13:59.829 --> 01:14:01.289]  And selectively arrest us.
[01:14:01.289 --> 01:14:03.750]  And selectively arrest us if we dare have any.
[01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:06.171]  But they'll be happy to get them in the hands of Al-Qaeda.
[01:14:06.171 --> 01:14:07.332]  Where does Al-Qaeda get their weapons?
[01:14:07.332 --> 01:14:07.572]  Missiles.
[01:14:08.412 --> 01:14:11.053]  Let's track the weapons that were used in Mali.
[01:14:11.053 --> 01:14:15.674]  Let's track the weapons that are used in Syria and find out they track right back to the State Department.
[01:14:15.674 --> 01:14:17.314]  Now let me bring this up since you said that.
[01:14:17.314 --> 01:14:24.635]  People always in the mainstream media spin it that I'm saying, and this is a quote of Chris Matthews, that Bush was at the towers with a plunger.
[01:14:24.635 --> 01:14:32.237]  Bush is a teleprompter reading puppet like Obama to many levels, though Obama more and more we're learning is actually, you know, enjoying what's happening and in there running some of the things.
[01:14:32.797 --> 01:14:43.161]  I've always said criminal globalist elements are financing and using Al-Qaeda as a pretext to menace us into slavery and as a pretext to bring in a police state.
[01:14:43.161 --> 01:14:46.442]  And look at the Homeland Documents, it's all about returning veterans gun owners.
[01:14:46.442 --> 01:14:51.144]  I mean, don't I get an apology from the national conservatives out there who spun it?
[01:14:51.144 --> 01:14:53.804]  That I was saying the whole government was doing 9-11?
[01:14:53.804 --> 01:14:54.925]  I would say forget about it.
[01:14:54.925 --> 01:14:57.886]  The issue is that you're right in tracking the
[01:14:58.406 --> 01:14:59.467]  We are the drug cartels, we are Al-Qaeda!
[01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:22.351]  This is a fundamental obligation.
[01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:27.153]  You know, 100 miles into the Texas border, all over the state, anywhere I have to go, they have border patrol checkpoints.
[01:15:27.153 --> 01:15:30.895]  And when I pull up now and they go, I want to search your car, I go, you know the government ships the drugs.
[01:15:30.895 --> 01:15:32.016]  And they go, alright, you can go.
[01:15:32.016 --> 01:15:33.617]  I mean, they all know it.
[01:15:33.617 --> 01:15:39.320]  And look, Al-Qaeda right now, I'm getting, we have a group of expatriates out of Libya.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.581]  They've been sending us information.
[01:15:41.388 --> 01:15:44.310]  Al-Qaeda has taken over Libya.
[01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:45.451]  They fly the flags there!
[01:15:45.451 --> 01:15:52.755]  And they are, in fact, raging a tribal war where they're killing other tribes that were favorable to Gaddafi.
[01:15:52.755 --> 01:15:57.338]  We're not saying, oh, we've got to use this doctrine to protect people, have the UN go in.
[01:15:57.338 --> 01:15:57.458]  No.
[01:15:57.458 --> 01:15:58.799]  Well, they're ethnic-closing the blacks.
[01:15:58.799 --> 01:16:03.242]  Because as long as Al-Qaeda is killing people, our government's going to stand down.
[01:16:04.042 --> 01:16:10.926]  I mean, the whole Arab Spring was a takeover by the Muslim Brotherhood of all these countries, one after the other.
[01:16:10.926 --> 01:16:11.786]  So where is it all going?
[01:16:11.786 --> 01:16:12.567]  How do we beat this?
[01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:15.028]  Well, again, exposing it is fundamental.
[01:16:15.028 --> 01:16:19.390]  People waking up and understanding that, you know, we've got a criminal government.
[01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:20.951]  It demands investigation.
[01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:26.034]  When you were calling for investigations, Alex, you need to have you on the investigating committee.
[01:16:26.474 --> 01:16:38.364]  Not some, you know, Warren Commission that's got that where, you know, you get the State Department and the Justice Department saying the first 24 hours, we got to make sure Lee Harvey Oswald is found as the culprit.
[01:16:38.364 --> 01:16:39.666]  Paper over it.
[01:16:39.666 --> 01:16:46.531]  Put the critics on the investigating committees, give them the power, and let's prosecute the federal officials.
[01:16:46.531 --> 01:16:48.013]  How about Nancy Pelosi?
[01:16:48.013 --> 01:16:49.294]  How about Barack Obama?
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:54.863]  You know, in terms of criminal activity... Rand Paul said, bare minimum, Hillary should have to step down.
[01:16:54.863 --> 01:16:57.185]  Obviously, the White House has been caught lying.
[01:16:57.185 --> 01:16:58.025]  Quit lying!
[01:16:58.025 --> 01:17:04.069]  You know, I want to know, for the eight hours this embassy was under attack and we had drones there, do they sit and watch it?
[01:17:04.798 --> 01:17:05.318]  Of course they did!
[01:17:26.924 --> 01:17:29.846]  If they didn't die, we were going to expose our own gun running.
[01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:38.334]  So the White House and over in Pentagon and CIA, they watched them die rather than call in military.
[01:17:38.334 --> 01:17:41.497]  And order the CIA torture base down the road to not help.
[01:17:41.497 --> 01:17:42.478]  And stand down.
[01:17:43.672 --> 01:17:53.220]  Some of the, I believe at least two of the government officials, the military that were there dying in Benghazi basically violated orders and went in.
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.741]  That's right, yeah, the Navy SEALs.
[01:17:54.741 --> 01:17:56.303]  The Navy SEALs violated orders.
[01:17:56.303 --> 01:17:58.244]  They weren't going to stand for this.
[01:17:58.244 --> 01:17:59.946]  They were there begging for help.
[01:17:59.946 --> 01:18:00.706]  They were calling in...
[01:18:01.707 --> 01:18:05.790]  You know, trajectories, giving target locations.
[01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:08.112]  Well, that was because the drones around there had to be armed.
[01:18:08.112 --> 01:18:15.337]  For eight hours, you had up to 500 people with anti-aircraft guns cranked down to the ground, firing into the building.
[01:18:15.337 --> 01:18:19.940]  And what does Obama and Hillary come, they say, oh, it was because of a movie.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:23.983]  Again, using the incident to try to quash free speech.
[01:18:24.764 --> 01:18:27.187]  They always say they were insulted over this movie.
[01:18:27.187 --> 01:18:29.469]  Well, they recycle everything they do to attack freedom.
[01:18:29.469 --> 01:18:30.210]  Attack freedom.
[01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:33.173]  It's all back on attack the United States citizens.
[01:18:33.173 --> 01:18:38.499]  Take the guns away, take the First Amendment away, and use any incident that happens.
[01:18:38.499 --> 01:18:44.325]  Let me ask you this, if we don't stop them studying this worldwide, reading their own white papers, their own sociologists,
[01:18:45.266 --> 01:18:47.446]  Where does it go if we don't stop them?
[01:18:47.446 --> 01:18:54.448]  If it doesn't stop them, we might as well read Nazi Germany again, because we're going to be the victims in another Nazi Germany.
[01:18:54.448 --> 01:18:55.608]  There's going to be no place to go.
[01:18:55.608 --> 01:18:57.268]  These are authoritarians.
[01:18:57.268 --> 01:19:02.689]  And let's let's let Congress know that if Congress doesn't listen, everybody in Congress, we vote out.
[01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:03.789]  Anybody who's there, we just vote out.
[01:19:03.789 --> 01:19:05.590]  But it's time to be freaking out.
[01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:12.091]  I mean, this is this is openly... And demand hearings, demand investigations, press the information.
[01:19:12.091 --> 01:19:13.911]  Every day, Alex, when you're out there,
[01:19:15.097 --> 01:19:19.562]  Showing people what's really in the news, your audience, what we're doing at WND.
[01:19:19.562 --> 01:19:22.425]  This is an extremely important function.
[01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:23.647]  Get the truth.
[01:19:23.647 --> 01:19:25.349]  The Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:19:25.349 --> 01:19:29.553]  When people realized that they were going to take four football fields wide of Texas.
[01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:33.191]  And to give it to Spain to develop his highway.
[01:19:33.191 --> 01:19:34.472]  That's globalism!
[01:19:34.472 --> 01:19:37.233]  And finally, Texans came out of these meetings.
[01:19:37.233 --> 01:19:42.314]  They told Rick Perry and the Texas Department of Transportation they could shove this plan.
[01:19:42.314 --> 01:19:44.715]  But six years later, like a roach, he creeps back.
[01:19:44.715 --> 01:19:45.376]  Come back.
[01:19:45.376 --> 01:19:47.096]  It's constant vigilance.
[01:19:47.096 --> 01:19:48.477]  Jefferson was right.
[01:19:48.477 --> 01:19:49.257]  Constant vigilance.
[01:19:49.257 --> 01:19:51.418]  And anyone who approaches the jewel is an enemy.
[01:19:51.418 --> 01:19:53.919]  And they will target us as the enemy.
[01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:54.439]  That's fine.
[01:19:54.439 --> 01:19:55.099]  Hey, we're committed.
[01:19:55.099 --> 01:19:56.020]  We're going all the way.
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:58.961]  We'll be back with a final segment to talk about the new royalty.
[01:19:58.961 --> 01:19:59.401]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.779 --> 01:20:04.781]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[01:20:04.781 --> 01:20:12.285]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[01:20:12.285 --> 01:20:14.986]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:20:14.986 --> 01:20:21.589]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:20:21.589 --> 01:20:22.730]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:32.024]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[01:20:32.024 --> 01:20:35.750]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:38.050]  I can't feed you.
[01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:40.351]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[01:21:01.889 --> 01:21:04.110]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:09.192]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:21:09.192 --> 01:21:10.993]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:21:10.993 --> 01:21:16.255]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[01:21:16.255 --> 01:21:23.458]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:21:24.298 --> 01:21:27.079]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:21:27.079 --> 01:21:30.881]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:21:30.881 --> 01:21:39.424]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:21:39.424 --> 01:21:49.568]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:21:50.308 --> 01:21:55.633]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[01:21:55.633 --> 01:21:57.655]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.

[01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:23.510]  It's like a salon in a bottle.
[01:22:29.153 --> 01:22:38.479]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:38.479 --> 01:22:39.280]  This capitalism?
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:45.544]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:46.425]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:46.425 --> 01:22:49.667]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:22:49.667 --> 01:22:50.467]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:22:59.453 --> 01:23:04.239]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:04.239 --> 01:23:07.262]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:07.262 --> 01:23:16.231]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:16.231 --> 01:23:21.157]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:21.776 --> 01:23:33.144]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:23:33.144 --> 01:23:40.149]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:40.829 --> 01:23:45.130]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:48.731]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:23:48.731 --> 01:23:55.973]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY, or visit carnivora.com.
[01:23:55.973 --> 01:23:57.254]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:57.254 --> 01:23:58.294]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:11.167 --> 01:24:12.849]  Final segment with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:24:12.849 --> 01:24:20.835]  He's got a big book coming out in a couple months exposing just the death panels that didn't exist and that they now are saying are so great.
[01:24:20.835 --> 01:24:24.218]  It is just unspeakable how evil these authoritarians are.
[01:24:24.218 --> 01:24:28.722]  And it's not authoritarianism for domination because they have some grand plan to help people.
[01:24:28.722 --> 01:24:31.345]  The globalists I've studied them really hate humanity.
[01:24:31.345 --> 01:24:33.566]  They're very unhappy, nasty people.
[01:24:33.566 --> 01:24:36.389]  But you mentioned something earlier I wanted to flesh out here.
[01:24:36.389 --> 01:24:38.331]  Here's the weekly standard and it is in the new bill.
[01:24:39.631 --> 01:24:40.512]  I don't know.
[01:24:59.272 --> 01:24:59.552]  Exactly.
[01:25:16.303 --> 01:25:18.944]  I mean, that is so discriminatory!
[01:25:18.944 --> 01:25:21.226]  Obama gets to have all the vacations he wants.
[01:25:21.226 --> 01:25:22.586]  Travel anywhere he wants to go.
[01:25:22.586 --> 01:25:24.947]  Look at how Nancy Pelosi flies around.
[01:25:24.947 --> 01:25:28.269]  This is all, they have their own health system in Congress.
[01:25:28.269 --> 01:25:32.892]  They have their own lifestyle, their own parking lot, their own restaurants.
[01:25:32.892 --> 01:25:35.033]  It's a scenicure for life.
[01:25:35.033 --> 01:25:37.114]  Pensions forever if you're in for one term.
[01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:44.577]  You know, look, Alex, this entire plan, the entire attack on God, that's what my new book is on, the ACLU.
[01:25:44.577 --> 01:25:46.718]  It's on the plan to remove God.
[01:25:46.718 --> 01:25:48.239]  It's called The Bad Samaritan.
[01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:51.500]  Gloria Steinem had to wear a shirt saying, I got an abortion, it's beautiful.
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.261]  Okay, we're celebrating abortions.
[01:25:53.261 --> 01:25:55.602]  Now the next thing, if we're celebrating abortions,
[01:25:55.982 --> 01:25:58.743]  The next plan will be to celebrate the killing of the old.
[01:25:58.743 --> 01:26:01.543]  You must not watch mainline new TV.
[01:26:01.543 --> 01:26:02.103]  No, no.
[01:26:02.103 --> 01:26:06.704]  The sexy thing is to talk about how ugly old people are and how great it is to kill them.
[01:26:06.704 --> 01:26:07.624]  Right, because they're useless.
[01:26:07.624 --> 01:26:09.025]  They're just, you know, wasted.
[01:26:09.025 --> 01:26:09.565]  They're old.
[01:26:09.565 --> 01:26:10.385]  They can't do anything.
[01:26:10.385 --> 01:26:11.145]  They can't contribute.
[01:26:11.145 --> 01:26:11.925]  Kill them.
[01:26:11.925 --> 01:26:20.867]  But at the same time, all the groups that are supporting Obama, all the leftist-oriented groups, the minorities, are being used as dupes.
[01:26:20.867 --> 01:26:22.907]  Nothing is in return to them.
[01:26:22.907 --> 01:26:24.208]  Obama won't even go talk to them.
[01:26:24.208 --> 01:26:25.588]  Remember what Maxine Waters said.
[01:26:25.748 --> 01:26:27.449]  Go to the African-American communities.
[01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:29.191]  Look at the highest unemployment.
[01:26:29.191 --> 01:26:31.673]  Look at the biggest crime and drug use.
[01:26:31.673 --> 01:26:33.054]  Dropouts from schools.
[01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:34.595]  Exploding families.
[01:26:34.595 --> 01:26:37.517]  What is any federal government doing?
[01:26:37.517 --> 01:26:40.360]  Chicago, where the Don runs things.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.941]  Go into Detroit.
[01:26:41.941 --> 01:26:43.002]  Take a look at the comparison.
[01:26:43.002 --> 01:26:44.343]  It's circulating on the internet.
[01:26:44.343 --> 01:26:47.926]  Between Detroit and Hiroshima at the end of World War II.
[01:26:47.926 --> 01:26:49.627]  Hiroshima is a thriving community.
[01:26:49.627 --> 01:26:51.929]  Detroit, under social... This is devastating.
[01:26:52.469 --> 01:26:54.951]  That's the future of America under socialism.
[01:26:54.951 --> 01:26:55.771]  Detroit.
[01:26:55.771 --> 01:26:56.772]  Go look at it.
[01:26:56.772 --> 01:26:57.833]  No jobs.
[01:26:57.833 --> 01:26:59.254]  The jobs to China.
[01:26:59.254 --> 01:27:00.875]  Everybody in poverty.
[01:27:00.875 --> 01:27:02.976]  Everybody facing either going to the drug war.
[01:27:02.976 --> 01:27:07.839]  And when I say to socialists that are mid-level and really mean well, they go, everything's going to collapse.
[01:27:07.839 --> 01:27:08.360]  Austerity.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.701]  You want to kill old people.
[01:27:09.701 --> 01:27:12.823]  And meanwhile, it's the eugenicists saying they're going to kill the old people.
[01:27:12.823 --> 01:27:17.025]  And my book, this whole thing, got to look at the Cloward-Pippen theory.
[01:27:17.025 --> 01:27:21.809]  The plan is to so bankrupt the United States with new
[01:27:22.609 --> 01:27:27.933]  Entitlement programs, Obamacare, you've got, you know, all the food stamps you want.
[01:27:27.933 --> 01:27:37.580]  Well, they'll roll out entitlement after entitlement because the idea is we'll never be able to pay for them, we'll be bankrupt, and the collapse of the United States, they'll blame capitalism.
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:39.701]  Then to open the door for the Chinese.
[01:27:39.701 --> 01:27:41.662]  The Chinese will own the debt.
[01:27:41.662 --> 01:27:43.003]  And the Socialists... They already do!
[01:27:43.003 --> 01:27:44.604]  The Chinese know how to run capitalism.
[01:27:44.604 --> 01:27:46.025]  We'll just use the Chinese system.
[01:27:46.025 --> 01:27:48.086]  The Constitution is an old document.
[01:27:48.086 --> 01:27:53.529]  We've already had the Georgian... They're already saying that in the Piers Pressure article.
[01:27:53.529 --> 01:27:54.830]  Do one on this.
[01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:58.011]  This article says we need to do what the Communist Chinese say.
[01:27:58.011 --> 01:27:59.312]  Read it.
[01:27:59.312 --> 01:28:02.974]  And then I'll be dealt with.
[01:28:02.974 --> 01:28:05.776]  That's going to be for everybody.
[01:28:05.776 --> 01:28:07.457]  Did you see Piers Morgan say he wants to shoot me?
[01:28:07.717 --> 01:28:08.497]  Yes, I saw that.
[01:28:08.497 --> 01:28:10.458]  I saw the entire suit.
[01:28:10.458 --> 01:28:14.620]  Have you been around the so-called liberals privately where all they were talking about is killing people?
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:18.301]  Look, the whole agenda is a death agenda.
[01:28:18.301 --> 01:28:19.141]  Killing babies.
[01:28:19.141 --> 01:28:20.502]  How are we going to celebrate killing babies?
[01:28:20.502 --> 01:28:21.242]  Killing old people.
[01:28:21.242 --> 01:28:22.403]  Killing old people.
[01:28:22.403 --> 01:28:25.804]  How could the free market pay for everybody and now socialism nothing can be paid for?
[01:28:26.064 --> 01:28:31.366]  In fact, look, this is not, people need to understand, this is not an economic downturn we're in.
[01:28:31.366 --> 01:28:38.829]  This is a created, manipulated, structural unemployment, where even if the economy improved, the jobs created are in shambles.
[01:28:38.829 --> 01:28:40.610]  They've doubled the food stamps, that's on goal.
[01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:41.350]  Of course.
[01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:44.792]  They've had increasing dependency on the federal government.
[01:28:44.792 --> 01:28:52.155]  And they're saying, they've even got Rand Paul going, we've got to adapt or die, that's PSYOP, to make the Republican Party, you know, just the right wing of the left.
[01:28:52.415 --> 01:28:55.017]  The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are essentially one party.
[01:28:55.017 --> 01:28:55.957]  It's a psy-op!
[01:28:55.957 --> 01:28:56.858]  It's one party.
[01:28:56.858 --> 01:28:58.459]  People are rejecting socialism!
[01:28:58.459 --> 01:29:01.301]  And people have got to continue to reject socialism.
[01:29:01.301 --> 01:29:07.325]  People have got to start taking strong measures, demanding... And it's time to start... ...a criminal investigation.
[01:29:07.325 --> 01:29:09.827]  I agree, but isn't it start to not complying as well?
[01:29:09.827 --> 01:29:13.469]  Yes, also, first of all, the Second Amendment is fundamental.
[01:29:13.469 --> 01:29:15.291]  People have got to retain their guns.
[01:29:15.891 --> 01:29:19.874]  The Second Amendment was created for times when tyranny is on the rise.
[01:29:19.874 --> 01:29:20.635]  And it's here.
[01:29:20.635 --> 01:29:21.015]  It's here.
[01:29:21.015 --> 01:29:23.037]  And it's here and it's on the move.
[01:29:23.037 --> 01:29:25.198]  You know, our founders are fighting for us from the grave.
[01:29:25.198 --> 01:29:32.024]  And we've got to listen, because the words that they gave us, the instructions and the tools are right there.
[01:29:32.024 --> 01:29:33.405]  First Amendment, Second Amendment.
[01:29:33.405 --> 01:29:38.469]  And we've got to demand that the federal government, as a criminal government, running drug cartels,
[01:29:38.649 --> 01:29:42.151]  Tell you what, come back and do five more minutes with us, then the big announcement.
[01:29:42.151 --> 01:29:43.172]  I want you to finish up.
[01:29:43.172 --> 01:29:44.733]  Your plan is to turn this around.
[01:29:44.733 --> 01:29:45.954]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:29:45.954 --> 01:29:49.897]  Here we go.
[01:29:49.897 --> 01:29:51.297]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.297 --> 01:29:53.819]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:31:05.329 --> 01:31:12.852]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.

[01:31:22.136 --> 01:31:23.276]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[01:31:23.556 --> 01:31:32.586]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[01:31:32.586 --> 01:31:36.571]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[01:31:36.571 --> 01:31:38.373]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.

[01:32:04.427 --> 01:32:09.450]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:09.450 --> 01:32:16.635]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:32:16.775 --> 01:32:22.400]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:18.335]  Here's a surprise, tyrants.
[01:33:18.335 --> 01:33:19.576]  We can see you.
[01:33:19.576 --> 01:33:23.618]  We can see for miles and miles and miles.
[01:33:23.618 --> 01:33:25.799]  And we know your playbook.
[01:33:25.799 --> 01:33:28.141]  We've been warning people for decades.
[01:33:28.141 --> 01:33:31.063]  And now that we're coming down to the wire, people are going, wait.
[01:33:32.086 --> 01:33:34.181]  Ron Paul, Dr. Corsi, Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.748 --> 01:33:45.815]  G. Edward Griffin, countless others, Bob Chapman, the list goes on and on, Lou Rockwell, they all warned us about this and exactly what they said is now happening.
[01:33:45.815 --> 01:33:51.259]  They told us 10 years ago the smart meters were going to hook into all our electronics and track us and tax us and surveil us.
[01:33:51.259 --> 01:33:53.961]  And the government said it was a conspiracy theory, but now it's admitted.
[01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:58.564]  But wait, Alex said the NSA was spying on us 10 years ago without warrants, non-terror related.
[01:33:58.564 --> 01:33:59.344]  Now they admit it.
[01:33:59.344 --> 01:34:02.386]  Oh, Alex said that it was really for the American people, Homeland Security.
[01:34:02.386 --> 01:34:03.047]  Now it's admitted.
[01:34:04.268 --> 01:34:06.030]  Again, it's all happening.
[01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:09.834]  We've got a chance to beat these people if we realize they're really bad people.
[01:34:09.834 --> 01:34:14.479]  They're not misguided liberals, environmental wackos.
[01:34:14.479 --> 01:34:17.402]  I wish Rush Limbaugh would stop saying they're idiot wackos.
[01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:24.570]  These are, because I've been at hundreds of their events, and they always come over when the camera's off and punch you in the arm or grab your shirt and say, I'm gonna get you.
[01:34:24.570 --> 01:34:25.531]  One day we're gonna get you.
[01:34:25.751 --> 01:34:27.312]  I'm sure that's happened to you, Dr. Corsi.
[01:34:27.312 --> 01:34:30.595]  In closing, we've got some huge news coming up after you go.
[01:34:30.595 --> 01:34:32.517]  Kissinger predicts nuclear war with Iran.
[01:34:32.517 --> 01:34:34.018]  Infowars.com.
[01:34:34.018 --> 01:34:38.401]  Holder begins gun control push, trying to raise money for the Democratic Party on the back of it.
[01:34:38.401 --> 01:34:39.622]  Fireside chats.
[01:34:39.622 --> 01:34:42.885]  Assault weapon ban lacks Democratic votes to pass Senate.
[01:34:42.885 --> 01:34:44.967]  Don't think they won't have another shooting, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:45.367 --> 01:34:47.288]  Now that is just some of the stuff we've got here.
[01:34:47.288 --> 01:34:53.953]  We're going to make the big announcement on the $115,000 biggest contest ever after he leaves as Operation Paul Revere.
[01:34:53.953 --> 01:35:01.218]  That's going live with a red link right now at InfoWars.com and we'll post it to PrisonPlanet.com as a backup.
[01:35:01.218 --> 01:35:03.859]  But Doctor, we've had great banner for the last hour.
[01:35:03.859 --> 01:35:05.901]  Other points you want to add about solutions?
[01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:07.302]  I just want to first get your take on this.
[01:35:08.854 --> 01:35:10.115]  Look, this is real.
[01:35:10.115 --> 01:35:13.696]  I mean, you're more steeled than ever knowing it's real.
[01:35:13.696 --> 01:35:14.957]  We've talked privately.
[01:35:14.957 --> 01:35:19.399]  It's now all manifesting, our worst analysis being proven right.
[01:35:19.399 --> 01:35:21.500]  Again, people better take this serious.
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.741]  What can you say to police and military?
[01:35:23.741 --> 01:35:31.104]  I'm talking to police and military, and they're either totally waking up, and the majority of them are, or they're deciding to just sign on to evil.
[01:35:31.104 --> 01:35:32.445]  How will the system deal with that?
[01:35:32.805 --> 01:35:43.249]  Well, the police and the military have got the Oath Keepers, the whole plan to reach out and say, look, you know, because the New World Order will turn on the police as well.
[01:35:43.249 --> 01:35:44.089]  They always do.
[01:35:44.089 --> 01:35:47.751]  If they don't sign on, they'll be equally victims in this.
[01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:50.493]  But again, Alex, it's a plan.
[01:35:50.493 --> 01:35:52.815]  The Obama plan to bankrupt America.
[01:35:52.815 --> 01:35:53.375]  Your book.
[01:35:53.375 --> 01:35:55.617]  That's what I've been pushing people to read.
[01:35:55.617 --> 01:36:01.622]  To understand that once we are indebted to China, we can't tell China to stay out.
[01:36:01.622 --> 01:36:07.687]  Once you've sold Current TV to Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera owns the airwaves.
[01:36:07.687 --> 01:36:08.448]  That's globalism!
[01:36:08.448 --> 01:36:10.890]  Have foreigners come in and buy everything!
[01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:12.271]  I wrote a book, America for Sale.
[01:36:12.791 --> 01:36:22.839]  I warn people, you're going to be reduced down to, you know, living in the safe places where you can find to live, burying your guns, having, you know, food to live, and even that's not safe.
[01:36:22.839 --> 01:36:23.699]  How long are you going to last?
[01:36:23.699 --> 01:36:25.160]  No, they know we've got the food!
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.003]  And, but, people are going to understand what you've been saying is true.
[01:36:28.703 --> 01:36:31.686]  Fast and Furious occurred from the top.
[01:36:31.686 --> 01:36:44.281]  It was an administration-concocted plan by Eric Holder to take the guns away, to attack the Second Amendment, to have these guns show up at events, you know, killings and murders and say, look,
[01:36:44.801 --> 01:36:45.883]  The guns are being sold.
[01:36:45.883 --> 01:36:47.705]  That came out in the memos!
[01:36:47.705 --> 01:36:49.647]  And he tried to get the truth.
[01:36:49.647 --> 01:36:51.490]  The memos won't be released.
[01:36:51.490 --> 01:37:00.381]  The testimony, even Hillary's testimony, lying testimony, testimony where Hillary did not say, where are the 25 people who survived Benghazi?
[01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:01.503]  Why can't we talk to them?
[01:37:01.883 --> 01:37:06.285]  What was the White House doing and the CIA for the eight hours of this attack?
[01:37:06.285 --> 01:37:10.448]  Were they watching it occur and not sending in the military to save our troops?
[01:37:10.448 --> 01:37:16.271]  Why do the two SEALs have to essentially disobey orders to go to protect Stevens?
[01:37:16.271 --> 01:37:18.792]  Again, what were the guns we were running there?
[01:37:18.792 --> 01:37:30.538]  You do not launder billions of dollars through HSBC for the Mexican drug cartels, all admitted, fines now out there, we've been publishing it in WND, without the government
[01:37:30.818 --> 01:37:35.179]  The cartel leaders said in trials, hey, we have a national security pass.
[01:37:35.179 --> 01:37:36.680]  We were doing this with the government.
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.100]  We are the drug cartels.
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:39.960]  We are al-Qaeda.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:41.301]  We are arming al-Qaeda.
[01:37:41.301 --> 01:37:43.941]  We are arming the drug cartels.
[01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:46.842]  Let's have criminal investigations of Hillary.
[01:37:46.842 --> 01:37:48.022]  Let's get the documents.
[01:37:48.022 --> 01:37:49.503]  Let's demand the documents.
[01:37:49.503 --> 01:37:50.683]  Why are they so bold?
[01:37:50.683 --> 01:37:56.705]  How could they publicly use al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and then go on the news and say, you've got to give your rights up.
[01:37:56.705 --> 01:37:58.125]  Al-Qaeda got weapons in Libya.
[01:37:58.285 --> 01:38:02.127]  With a compliant press with, you know, Piers Morgan, with all these other people.
[01:38:02.127 --> 01:38:05.269]  Piers, bring the foreigners in here and have them lecture to us on gun control.
[01:38:05.269 --> 01:38:07.290]  They actually says that, and they're going to get me!
[01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:08.711]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:08.711 --> 01:38:12.453]  And, you know, the whole idea is avoid investigation.
[01:38:12.453 --> 01:38:13.814]  That's what the government wants to do.
[01:38:13.814 --> 01:38:14.774]  No memos.
[01:38:14.774 --> 01:38:18.677]  Where are the memos and the investigation on Benghazi?
[01:38:18.677 --> 01:38:22.679]  Take the head of the EPA when they caught her using a dummy email.
[01:38:22.919 --> 01:38:24.319]  HSBC, let's have a hearing.
[01:38:24.319 --> 01:38:25.660]  How did that happen?
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.980]  And the Federal Reserve didn't know about it.
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.360]  Why won't the Congress do it?
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:29.840]  Blackmailed?
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:30.301]  Threatened?
[01:38:30.301 --> 01:38:32.141]  Look, the Congress is part of the deal.
[01:38:32.141 --> 01:38:36.302]  Congress is being offered a lifetime royalty, as you say.
[01:38:36.302 --> 01:38:37.442]  They've got their positions.
[01:38:37.442 --> 01:38:40.322]  The Democratic and Republican Party are basically in agreement.
[01:38:40.322 --> 01:38:42.563]  And now they're offering the cops lifetime royalty.
[01:38:42.563 --> 01:38:45.263]  Take the people's guns, you can keep yours after you retire.
[01:38:45.263 --> 01:38:47.564]  Cops, if you believe that, you're idiots.
[01:38:48.084 --> 01:38:57.892]  It just says, believing the fact that if we let them go on this one, you know, why don't we have a Watergate-style investigation of the entire Obama administration?
[01:38:57.892 --> 01:38:58.272]  I agree.
[01:38:58.272 --> 01:39:10.001]  You know, they admit, and we've done a thousand times what Nixon did, ten thousand times, they admit it's the cops holding up, going after the guns, because the cops know they're going to have their guns taken, and the cops know it's going to be a civil war.
[01:39:10.001 --> 01:39:12.382]  The cops better protect us because the cops are next.
[01:39:13.163 --> 01:39:14.344]  That's the point.
[01:39:14.344 --> 01:39:20.487]  The Communist Chinese would be happy to come in here with their military and tell the local law enforcement, we don't need you anymore.
[01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:22.427]  Well, they'll tell them, turn your guns in and then they're going to kill them.
[01:39:22.427 --> 01:39:24.188]  But look, you've got the NSA.
[01:39:24.188 --> 01:39:28.010]  The NSA can read your emails, read my emails.
[01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:32.332]  You mean they couldn't read the emails of HSBC laundering money?
[01:39:32.332 --> 01:39:36.974]  They couldn't read the emails of the drug cartels coming across the border?
[01:39:36.974 --> 01:39:42.097]  They couldn't read the emails from Ambassador Stevens saying we're not protected here?
[01:39:42.737 --> 01:39:45.300]  Running guns with Al-Qaeda taking over.
[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.863]  Do you talk to a lot of corporate and government people?
[01:39:47.863 --> 01:39:49.004]  Are they concerned right now?
[01:39:49.004 --> 01:39:50.146]  Increasingly.
[01:39:50.146 --> 01:39:55.031]  Because again, the corporations, you know, the whole idea is, well, corporations will be fine in globalism.
[01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:57.073]  They'll use all the labor from China.
[01:39:57.073 --> 01:39:58.835]  You know, they don't need American labor.
[01:39:58.835 --> 01:40:01.719]  See this, people, American labor is useless.
[01:40:02.359 --> 01:40:03.820]  It's a detail.
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:09.184]  You don't need expensive American or European... Don't all these rich people know they're going to get double-crossed?
[01:40:09.184 --> 01:40:11.046]  That's the whole point.
[01:40:11.046 --> 01:40:13.228]  You're not going to be safe by being ignorant.
[01:40:13.228 --> 01:40:14.408]  They're idiots.
[01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:18.231]  The governing class is going to slit their throats.
[01:40:18.231 --> 01:40:21.113]  This is the big move towards globalism.
[01:40:21.113 --> 01:40:29.100]  It's the one chance where they think if they can just bankrupt the United States, eliminate the military, step-by-step China will move in.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.741]  We become a colony.
[01:40:31.471 --> 01:40:32.892]  The Communist China.
[01:40:32.892 --> 01:40:34.232]  We become the globalists.
[01:41:01.503 --> 01:41:01.944]  God.
[01:41:01.944 --> 01:41:03.685]  They think God is old.
[01:41:03.685 --> 01:41:05.427]  How is this Suze's film wrong?
[01:41:05.427 --> 01:41:09.870]  Well, Suze's film is wrong in that we want to colonialize America.
[01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:10.851]  Obama... That's right.
[01:41:10.851 --> 01:41:12.933]  America is being colonialized by the globalists.
[01:41:12.933 --> 01:41:15.916]  Obama doesn't mind colonialism as long as he's the one doing the colonizing.
[01:41:15.916 --> 01:41:16.616]  Exactly.
[01:41:16.616 --> 01:41:17.457]  It's a total lie.
[01:41:17.457 --> 01:41:21.140]  Globalism is corporate colonization using communist methods.
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:23.943]  And look, the banks do it because the banks will control the money.
[01:41:24.463 --> 01:41:29.290]  You know, if England thinks it's going to vote out of the EU, they're not going to get a chance to do that.
[01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:30.852]  That's not going to happen.
[01:41:30.852 --> 01:41:37.261]  The EU, again, bankrupting the EU, bankrupting... And their own documents admit it was designed to bankrupt.
[01:41:37.261 --> 01:41:40.005]  It puts more power in the hands of the global bankers.
[01:41:40.625 --> 01:41:46.370]  And the EU bureaucrats are all exempt from the taxes.
[01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:47.030]  Same deal!
[01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.471]  Yes.
[01:41:47.471 --> 01:41:53.335]  The only money in the United States today is held by the Chinese of the richest country in the world.
[01:41:53.335 --> 01:41:57.258]  The drug cartels have more money than the corporations of the federal government.
[01:41:57.258 --> 01:42:00.060]  The federal government has been intentionally bankrupt.
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:01.141]  A criminal takeover.
[01:42:01.141 --> 01:42:01.862]  Criminal takeover.
[01:42:01.862 --> 01:42:04.684]  It's a criminal takeover by the globalists of the federal government.
[01:42:04.684 --> 01:42:05.486]  And they're just criminals.
[01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:06.288]  We have a coup d'etat.
[01:42:06.288 --> 01:42:08.033]  That's why they use criminal tactics.
[01:42:08.033 --> 01:42:10.319]  Obama is having a coup d'etat from within.
[01:42:10.794 --> 01:42:14.376]  A criminal cartel, foreign criminal cartel coup d'etat.
[01:42:14.376 --> 01:42:21.941]  We are, the United States government is the drug cartel, we are the drug cartels, we are Al Qaeda.
[01:42:21.941 --> 01:42:26.203]  We're funding Al Qaeda, we're putting guns... Again, the criminal groups that have come in and hijacked are.
[01:42:26.203 --> 01:42:26.764]  Right.
[01:42:26.764 --> 01:42:28.545]  And killing Qaddafi.
[01:42:28.545 --> 01:42:30.746]  Obama, why'd Obama turn on Qaddafi?
[01:42:30.746 --> 01:42:31.987]  He'd come in and worked with him.
[01:42:31.987 --> 01:42:35.129]  Qaddafi funded Obama through Louis Farrakhan.
[01:42:35.729 --> 01:42:37.530]  Reverend Wright met with Gaddafi.
[01:42:37.530 --> 01:42:39.350]  He funded Sarkozy.
[01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:40.491]  That's even come out in the news.
[01:42:40.491 --> 01:42:42.331]  And then Obama turns on Gaddafi.
[01:42:42.331 --> 01:42:44.192]  They double-crossed their own guy.
[01:42:44.192 --> 01:42:48.374]  Threw Gaddafi to the wolves because he had Al-Qaeda coming to the fore.
[01:42:48.374 --> 01:42:52.795]  Al-Qaeda's taken over all the criminal... Which again is Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:52.795 --> 01:42:54.296]  The whole idea... That's the deal.
[01:42:54.296 --> 01:42:56.297]  The whole idea that's Arab Spring.
[01:42:56.297 --> 01:42:57.297]  Turn everything over to the Saudis.
[01:42:57.757 --> 01:43:03.182]  Only more of the Muslim Brotherhood, the radicals, taking over all of North Africa.
[01:43:03.182 --> 01:43:09.667]  So it's Saudi Arabia, the Communist Chinese, and the megabanks all teamed up against any country they don't control.
[01:43:09.667 --> 01:43:11.368]  Any country they don't control.
[01:43:11.368 --> 01:43:20.996]  And bankrupting the United States people, making the United States people feel like if they don't get their social security checks, look at the number of people that are on the verge of bankruptcy in the United States.
[01:43:20.996 --> 01:43:23.338]  Number of people facing losing their homes.
[01:43:23.338 --> 01:43:26.441]  The plan is to take the homes away from Americans.
[01:43:26.661 --> 01:43:27.602]  And nationalize that.
[01:43:27.602 --> 01:43:31.164]  The plan is to reduce Americans to poverty.
[01:43:31.164 --> 01:43:38.928]  And this whole Cloward-Piven theory is a conscious attempt to bankrupt the United States in order for the globalists to gain power.
[01:43:38.928 --> 01:43:40.509]  It's domestication for slaughter.
[01:43:40.509 --> 01:43:43.050]  Dr. Corsi, you've got to go catch an airplane.
[01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:45.872]  We're going to have you back on very, very soon when the new book comes out.
[01:43:45.872 --> 01:43:50.094]  In fact, I want to tell Weldon Henson back there over our department, I want to carry... Bad Samaritans.
[01:43:50.094 --> 01:43:51.154]  Bad Samaritans.
[01:43:51.154 --> 01:43:51.775]  You'll have it.
[01:43:51.775 --> 01:43:53.576]  I want to carry all your new books.
[01:43:54.096 --> 01:43:55.537]  All right, Dr. Corsi, thank you for being with us.
[01:43:55.537 --> 01:43:56.017]  All right, Alex.
[01:43:56.017 --> 01:43:56.818]  You're doing God's work.
[01:43:56.818 --> 01:43:57.458]  Keep it up.
[01:43:57.458 --> 01:43:58.399]  Thank you, sir.
[01:43:58.399 --> 01:43:58.739]  Wow.
[01:43:58.739 --> 01:44:01.201]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's got to leave us to go get on an airplane.
[01:44:01.201 --> 01:44:02.662]  There goes Dr. Corsi.
[01:44:02.662 --> 01:44:04.923]  We'll help him get unhooked in here.
[01:44:04.923 --> 01:44:09.747]  And just amazing times that we live in.
[01:44:09.747 --> 01:44:11.228]  Absolutely amazing times.
[01:44:11.228 --> 01:44:12.669]  And I've studied history.
[01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:15.931]  I became obsessed with history when I was about 10 years old and became a good reader.
[01:44:17.072 --> 01:44:17.792]  And I've studied it.
[01:44:17.792 --> 01:44:20.294]  I've studied communism, fascism, socialism.
[01:44:20.294 --> 01:44:31.383]  I've read the books of Dr. Curl Quigley, the books of the White House Science Czar, the books of the Rockefellers, their foundations, their statements, everything that they stand for.
[01:44:31.383 --> 01:44:33.744]  And their game plan is 100% public.
[01:44:33.744 --> 01:44:36.787]  So when people ask, how do I know that TSA was coming to Austin?
[01:44:37.227 --> 01:44:40.971]  Well, they've announced they're going to be in every city, and now they're here running checkpoints on the road.
[01:44:40.971 --> 01:44:42.513]  I also have my police sources.
[01:44:42.513 --> 01:44:46.677]  I mean, people ask, how did I know they'd start putting smart meters on with armed police?
[01:44:46.677 --> 01:44:47.618]  Well, they announced they would.
[01:44:47.618 --> 01:44:56.628]  How did I know they would start double and triple charging, you know, during peak times with smart meters, and then smart meters would dial in to all the new appliances 15 years ago?
[01:44:56.628 --> 01:44:58.870]  And now it's just happening, because it was all MIT documents.
[01:45:00.258 --> 01:45:12.722]  You can't go buy a dishwasher now, or any major appliance that doesn't have Bluetooth or wireless hookups, TVs, you name it, with cameras on them, dialing in through the smart meter, watching and listening to you.
[01:45:12.722 --> 01:45:14.243]  I mean, it's beyond 1984.
[01:45:16.442 --> 01:45:18.103]  The cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[01:45:18.103 --> 01:45:19.565]  Thousands of documents.
[01:45:19.565 --> 01:45:20.726]  Sterilizing people.
[01:45:20.726 --> 01:45:21.546]  Killing people.
[01:45:21.546 --> 01:45:23.428]  I mean, we're living in a stinking nightmare.
[01:45:23.428 --> 01:45:25.390]  But it's all scientifically rolled out.
[01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:29.493]  And 95% of the government people and corporate don't know all this.
[01:45:29.493 --> 01:45:31.255]  That's why they haven't killed me.
[01:45:31.255 --> 01:45:32.756]  Because it's all a joke.
[01:45:32.756 --> 01:45:34.157]  Oh, listen to that loud Texan.
[01:45:34.157 --> 01:45:36.579]  Wouldn't you be loud if all this was true and you knew it?
[01:45:36.579 --> 01:45:37.240]  Well, it is true.
[01:45:38.231 --> 01:45:39.352]  Of course I'm upset.
[01:45:39.352 --> 01:45:42.414]  Man, I'm on the front lines of this thing.
[01:45:42.414 --> 01:45:46.417]  And if you'll just get out of your stinking coma, we can turn this thing around.
[01:45:46.417 --> 01:45:48.138]  Now, I want to make a big announcement, Roger.
[01:45:49.312 --> 01:45:50.493]  I have to skip this network break.
[01:45:50.493 --> 01:45:51.293]  You know what?
[01:45:51.293 --> 01:45:55.715]  I'll make the announcement with this video and then come back and make some other comments.
[01:45:55.715 --> 01:46:01.438]  The video just went up at InfoWars.com with the contest details and rules.
[01:46:01.438 --> 01:46:05.541]  It's all up at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:46:05.541 --> 01:46:09.182]  Red-linked in the featured news area and at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:46:09.182 --> 01:46:12.964]  InfoWars launches Operation Paul Revere.
[01:46:12.964 --> 01:46:14.065]  Here it is.
[01:46:14.065 --> 01:46:17.247]  This will be a huge blow against the globalists.
[01:46:17.247 --> 01:46:17.547]  Here it is.
[01:46:17.987 --> 01:46:24.834]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:46:24.834 --> 01:46:32.442]  Fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with the biggest contest announcement we've ever made.
[01:46:32.442 --> 01:46:35.205]  This is so incredibly exciting.
[01:46:35.205 --> 01:46:38.889]  We are launching Operation Paul Revere.
[01:46:39.813 --> 01:46:41.414]  What did Paul Revere do?
[01:46:41.414 --> 01:46:49.540]  He rode through the countryside in New England saying, to arms, to arms, the Redcoats are coming.
[01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:51.722]  Wanteth by land, toeth by sea.
[01:46:51.722 --> 01:46:56.225]  And all that evil men and tyrancy deflourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:46:56.225 --> 01:46:57.846]  Let me officially announce
[01:46:58.246 --> 01:47:01.567]  Operation Paul Revere.
[01:47:01.567 --> 01:47:09.229]  A $100,000 cash first place winner to be judged by yours truly, Alex Jones.
[01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:12.410]  The film can be three minutes, it can be up to two hours.
[01:47:12.410 --> 01:47:16.031]  It can be fiction, non-fiction, documentary, drama.
[01:47:16.511 --> 01:47:21.616]  It's got to promote liberty and freedom and expose tyranny and oppression.
[01:47:21.616 --> 01:47:23.118]  And it's not just people in the U.S.
[01:47:23.118 --> 01:47:23.718]  that can enter.
[01:47:23.718 --> 01:47:25.280]  It's folks worldwide.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:29.844]  The rules, the details, are at InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[01:47:29.844 --> 01:47:34.049]  You have to read the rules and officially sign up for this because it's a $100,000 prize first place.
[01:47:34.049 --> 01:47:34.709]  $10,000 second place.
[01:47:39.594 --> 01:47:40.714]  $5,000 third place.
[01:47:40.714 --> 01:48:01.628]  But just as I did last year with a reporter contest, we are going to crowdsource from the pool of incredible talent out there and hire several official crews to be directors and writers and camera people in InfoWars.com produced major films and documentaries that will be put in movie theaters and on cable.
[01:48:01.628 --> 01:48:03.650]  And I've got all the connections to get it done.
[01:48:03.650 --> 01:48:06.292]  Together, we're going to really give the New World Order hell.
[01:48:06.292 --> 01:48:07.672]  This is extremely exciting.
[01:48:07.672 --> 01:48:08.213]  I've made over 20 films.
[01:48:08.953 --> 01:48:12.257]  One of them alone has reached more than 40 million people on YouTube and Google Video.
[01:48:12.257 --> 01:48:16.861]  The Obama Deception, Endgame, Fall of the Republic, Road to Tyranny.
[01:48:16.861 --> 01:48:21.066]  Films are the most effective thing I do, but they're very time-consuming.
[01:48:21.066 --> 01:48:24.909]  And so I want to turn the power of We the People loose here.
[01:48:24.909 --> 01:48:29.694]  And your art, your research, your ideas are unstoppable.
[01:48:29.694 --> 01:48:31.936]  We're officially kicking the contest off.
[01:48:32.757 --> 01:48:33.878]  This Friday.
[01:48:33.878 --> 01:48:37.981]  And you've got a little more than three months until April 30th.
[01:48:37.981 --> 01:48:44.385]  Just a little more than three months to produce your documentary or your film and get it out.
[01:48:44.385 --> 01:48:47.967]  And it will absolutely reach tens of millions of people.
[01:48:47.967 --> 01:48:51.129]  Our normal contests get about 500 entries.
[01:48:51.129 --> 01:48:52.370]  That's what $10,000 prizes.
[01:48:52.370 --> 01:48:54.171]  This is 10 times that.
[01:48:54.171 --> 01:48:55.512]  $100,000 for first place.
[01:48:55.512 --> 01:48:57.814]  That's one of the biggest contests out there.
[01:48:57.814 --> 01:49:00.255]  In fact, it's the biggest next to Doritos that has $100,000.
[01:49:01.676 --> 01:49:03.897]  This is huge, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:03.897 --> 01:49:11.560]  $115,000 in cash prizes and a shot to have your film produced and financed by InfoWars.com.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:20.804]  Edit it, upload it to YouTube and one other alternate public video site and send your entry to PaulRevere at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:20.984 --> 01:49:26.945]  The animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is happening right now.
[01:49:26.945 --> 01:49:30.566]  The modern battlefield is in the mind more than ever.
[01:49:30.566 --> 01:49:33.806]  We use truth, the globalists use lies and deception.
[01:49:33.806 --> 01:49:37.687]  The corruption and oppression and high-tech police state is in our face.
[01:49:37.687 --> 01:49:39.387]  But the controllers are scared.
[01:49:39.387 --> 01:49:43.048]  They intended to use the internet to dominate and control humanity and surveil us.
[01:49:43.048 --> 01:49:45.548]  But we've turned their system against them.
[01:49:45.548 --> 01:49:48.769]  This is a historic crossroads that we have reached.
[01:49:49.409 --> 01:49:57.773]  And I asked you to ride in the year 2013 just as one of the founders of this republic did back in 1775.
[01:49:57.773 --> 01:50:05.596]  I'm calling you to arms in the Info War because the pen and the video camera is mightier than the sword.
[01:50:05.596 --> 01:50:12.379]  Let's go in there and rescue humanity and awaken them and set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:50:12.379 --> 01:50:13.559]  Be part of this contest.
[01:50:13.559 --> 01:50:14.820]  You've got three months.
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:16.060]  Put your hat in the ring.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:17.381]  Be part of the solution.
[01:50:17.841 --> 01:50:34.535]  Alright, we're going to break, and when we come back I'll give you more details of this, and then I'll get into some of the other news.
[01:50:34.535 --> 01:50:39.298]  But, again, I'm even shaken up right now by how fast this is moving.
[01:50:39.298 --> 01:50:41.840]  If you're a new listener and you're going, what is this all about?
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.723]  Read history, read about tyranny, that's what it's all about.
[01:50:47.469 --> 01:50:49.250]  There will probably be a thousand entries to this.
[01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:51.252]  This will probably reach a hundred million people.
[01:50:51.252 --> 01:50:53.794]  It'll be the best 115,000 ever spent.
[01:50:53.794 --> 01:50:56.016]  All of you win by entering the contest.
[01:50:56.016 --> 01:50:56.776]  Get involved now.
[01:50:56.776 --> 01:50:59.699]  Infowars.com has it red-linked at the top.
[01:51:00.942 --> 01:51:09.585]  If you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators, but were waiting for an offer so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[01:51:09.585 --> 01:51:10.405]  Here's why.
[01:51:10.405 --> 01:51:13.666]  Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:51:13.666 --> 01:51:20.368]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:51:20.368 --> 01:51:23.809]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[01:51:23.809 --> 01:51:24.829]  Now here's the best part.
[01:51:25.309 --> 01:51:30.094]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[01:51:30.094 --> 01:51:35.940]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of each year.
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:39.964]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[01:51:39.964 --> 01:51:44.669]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe!
[01:51:45.089 --> 01:51:46.750]  Don't wait, they go fast.

[01:52:05.691 --> 01:52:09.576]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

[01:54:16.235 --> 01:54:24.437]  Your own personal Jesus.

[01:54:27.298 --> 01:54:31.739]  Someone who cares.
[01:54:31.739 --> 01:54:36.681]  Your own personal Jesus.
[01:54:38.726 --> 01:54:40.587]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:54:40.587 --> 01:54:42.228]  to 2 p.m.
[01:54:42.228 --> 01:54:43.048]  Central.
[01:54:43.048 --> 01:54:50.071]  Again, any historian would look at what's happening and would say, oh my gosh, we're going into total fascism.
[01:54:50.071 --> 01:54:52.672]  But it's really eugenics, eugenicism.
[01:54:52.672 --> 01:54:54.393]  I've got to come up with a word for this.
[01:54:54.393 --> 01:54:57.275]  It's a technocratic hell.
[01:54:57.275 --> 01:55:02.277]  And everything, once you study it, is a psych warfare program to get you to submit to them.
[01:55:04.062 --> 01:55:06.164]  And to get you to take on the idea that you're guilty.
[01:55:06.164 --> 01:55:08.206]  I mean, look at these headlines up at Infowars.com.
[01:55:08.206 --> 01:55:10.188]  If you're a radio listener.
[01:55:10.188 --> 01:55:13.511]  Airport terror announcements now being played in hotels.
[01:55:13.511 --> 01:55:17.275]  And the article by Paul Watson and myself, we wrote this article together this morning.
[01:55:17.275 --> 01:55:18.796]  Paul's already written three articles today.
[01:55:18.796 --> 01:55:20.438]  I don't tell him to do that.
[01:55:20.438 --> 01:55:24.182]  He's passionate and works about 16 hours a day.
[01:55:24.182 --> 01:55:26.123]  Because he understands how bad it is.
[01:55:26.123 --> 01:55:27.285]  And when he's very clean cut,
[01:55:28.386 --> 01:55:35.532]  You know, his family are very nice, well-spoken people that, you know, look even aristocratic almost.
[01:55:35.532 --> 01:55:41.016]  And they go out in London and walk down the street and the police walk over and ask who you are, line up, you know, you're a terrorist.
[01:55:41.016 --> 01:55:45.820]  It's when you look handsome or smart, you're the enemy.
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:47.361]  Okay?
[01:55:47.361 --> 01:55:48.242]  It's when you care.
[01:55:48.242 --> 01:55:50.484]  The enemy senses it.
[01:55:50.484 --> 01:55:51.685]  If you look like a zombie,
[01:55:53.564 --> 01:55:56.224]  That's how I know how to infiltrate things, because I can pull it off.
[01:55:56.224 --> 01:56:01.445]  I can actually get in the mode of a low IQ and go... And then the system doesn't even notice you.
[01:56:01.445 --> 01:56:04.606]  They hate you when you're strong.
[01:56:04.606 --> 01:56:14.268]  And people like Watson and his brothers will be out with their wives or girlfriend, depending on which one, and it's just always the police come over and line up, gonna ask you some questions.
[01:56:14.268 --> 01:56:16.148]  It happened to me when I was in London.
[01:56:16.148 --> 01:56:20.229]  And this is how they operate.
[01:56:21.215 --> 01:56:27.080]  And they told me in England, they said, don't be here at the tube station, out on the street at the entrance, don't ask people questions here.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:29.202]  Move along or we'll have you thrown out.
[01:56:29.202 --> 01:56:31.343]  They do that to people that are born in England.
[01:56:31.343 --> 01:56:33.005]  England's not a free country anymore.
[01:56:33.005 --> 01:56:34.386]  Paul Watson knows that.
[01:56:34.386 --> 01:56:41.632]  So he sits in his house, 16 hours a day, conservatively, some days 18, fighting the new world order at a computer.
[01:56:45.970 --> 01:56:48.271]  Because he understands, and he doesn't like being a slave.
[01:56:48.271 --> 01:56:50.231]  He doesn't like that it's getting worse every minute.
[01:56:50.231 --> 01:56:52.912]  He doesn't like the oxygen is leaving the room.
[01:56:52.912 --> 01:56:54.413]  He knows.
[01:56:54.413 --> 01:57:04.816]  It's like the old swashbuckler archaeologist movies that came out in the 30s, 40s, and 50s that Indiana Jones, Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on.
[01:57:04.816 --> 01:57:11.338]  Where, you know, you're in the temple, and the water's coming in, rising up, and you've got to get out of your den, or the walls are coming in on you, or sand's pouring in.
[01:57:11.338 --> 01:57:13.579]  I mean, we've got to get out of this.
[01:57:15.058 --> 01:57:21.784]  And, you know, I'll be driving home, looking at the trees, looking at the moon, the beauty of the world, loving my wife, my children.
[01:57:21.784 --> 01:57:22.544]  I don't want to die.
[01:57:22.544 --> 01:57:25.487]  I don't want to die.
[01:57:25.487 --> 01:57:32.733]  I mean, I know there's a probability they'll kill me or put me in prison.
[01:57:32.733 --> 01:57:34.254]  I mean, I wish I wasn't right.
[01:57:34.254 --> 01:57:40.059]  I wish I wasn't having to be up here launching, you know, a huge contest with hundreds of films to defeat the enemy.
[01:57:40.059 --> 01:57:43.522]  I wish I didn't have to be so effective, because you know how dangerous that is?
[01:57:45.077 --> 01:57:46.537]  You know, I destroyed Piers Morgan.
[01:57:46.537 --> 01:57:47.338]  The proof's in the pudding.
[01:57:47.338 --> 01:57:49.078]  They won't have me on any of their shows.
[01:57:49.078 --> 01:57:52.419]  They're scared to death!
[01:57:52.419 --> 01:57:54.940]  Because they know I'll shake people out of their coma.
[01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:59.801]  Not because I'm anybody special, but because I am primitive.
[01:57:59.801 --> 01:58:01.122]  It's a primitive response.
[01:58:01.122 --> 01:58:04.683]  They don't want you in your normal response to being oppressed to go, I'm not your slave.
[01:58:04.683 --> 01:58:07.843]  They want you to just go along with it, comply.
[01:58:07.843 --> 01:58:09.344]  Now is the time to get involved.
[01:58:10.379 --> 01:58:12.060]  Now is the time to take on the globalists.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:17.322]  Now is the time to decide for, you know, what you serve, evil or good.
[01:58:17.322 --> 01:58:23.844]  And by the way, if we defend liberty, all the prosperity will come back.
[01:58:23.844 --> 01:58:25.245]  That's the thing.
[01:58:25.245 --> 01:58:34.968]  All of you that are part of the power structure and think this is going to be a beautiful, dark ride and you've got these visions of yourself with all this power to the state, you're going to wish later you'd not been part of this.
[01:58:34.968 --> 01:58:38.249]  Everybody, be part of this new film contest at Infowars.com. $115,000.

[01:58:50.939 --> 01:58:55.041]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.

[01:58:56.262 --> 01:59:01.965]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.
[01:59:01.965 --> 01:59:11.770]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound healing.
[01:59:11.770 --> 01:59:18.453]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases.
[01:59:18.553 --> 01:59:22.896]  Such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and other harmful pathogens.
[01:59:22.896 --> 01:59:32.003]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[01:59:32.003 --> 01:59:35.666]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[01:59:35.666 --> 01:59:39.509]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[01:59:53.778 --> 01:59:56.179]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.179 --> 01:59:58.960]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:10.403]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:11.984]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.984 --> 02:00:13.525]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.525 --> 02:00:17.728]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.728 --> 02:00:21.810]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.685 --> 02:00:33.027]  I want to look at the mass shootings in this country that have slightly increased the last 20 years.
[02:00:33.027 --> 02:00:40.309]  I say slightly increased because they're still incredibly rare, but it's one of the only violent crime statistics going up.
[02:00:40.309 --> 02:00:50.992]  In fact, we can reload those statistics from FBI.gov that Melissa Melton collated in that slideshow when Pharmacist Ben Fuchs joined us.
[02:00:50.992 --> 02:00:53.473]  Because I was listening to his show, I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday,
[02:00:54.602 --> 02:01:22.080]  And I actually sat in the car, because I used to get ready at home, I sat in the car as I was driving into the office, and I only got here about 40 minutes before air time, but I sat there for about 10 minutes wanting to listen to what he was saying, because I've interviewed so many brain surgeons, endocrinologists, you know, different scientists, that I knew everything he was saying was true, it was just reminding me of it all, but he was putting it together so concisely, and I said, could you come on Friday, I'll talk about this when we come back,
[02:01:23.376 --> 02:01:31.804]  I think he sent me something on drug interactions with SSRIs or SRIs and mass murdering and killing and this is what he sent me.
[02:01:31.804 --> 02:01:37.969]  All these documents and articles and inserts as a pharmacist, a compounding pharmacist, one of the most successful in Colorado.
[02:01:37.969 --> 02:01:40.392]  He was a mainline pharmacist before that.
[02:01:40.392 --> 02:01:42.213]  The guy looks 20 years younger than he is, I wish.
[02:01:42.213 --> 02:01:44.495]  But I got some other questions about allergies.
[02:01:44.495 --> 02:01:47.018]  I want to ask him after that because I've been on longevity.
[02:01:48.559 --> 02:01:50.140]  Steadily, but only a few of the products.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:51.540]  I've never been a big supplement person.
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:52.621]  I'm just not in the habit.
[02:01:52.621 --> 02:01:56.182]  For about a year, and I've lost about 25-30 pounds.
[02:01:56.182 --> 02:02:00.484]  It was about 40, but I gained some back because I never remember to do it all.
[02:02:00.484 --> 02:02:02.484]  And my muscle level's gone up.
[02:02:02.484 --> 02:02:07.426]  You know, standing there, you know, naked in my bathroom, I look a lot better than I used to.
[02:02:07.426 --> 02:02:12.088]  But the muscle weighs a couple times more than fat, so, you know, there's been that conversion.
[02:02:12.088 --> 02:02:16.430]  But what do I do with supplements?
[02:02:17.349 --> 02:02:24.757]  By the way, we have a university study on the InfoWars health supplements here that just came out from Yahoo Finance, just about how amazing they are.
[02:02:24.757 --> 02:02:28.721]  I mean, this is groundbreaking stuff or I wouldn't be promoting it.
[02:02:28.721 --> 02:02:39.512]  And my mountain juniper, they call it cedar allergy, that plagues half of Austin on average, has gotten so bad living here for 20-something years, since high school, 22 years.
[02:02:41.719 --> 02:02:46.881]  And most plants pop during the spring or summer.
[02:02:46.881 --> 02:02:51.443]  This thing goes off in the winter, December, January, February.
[02:02:51.443 --> 02:03:02.787]  It's so bad this year that I'm talking about going to Seattle or Miami Beach or somewhere for those months to do the show next year because it's a living hell.
[02:03:02.787 --> 02:03:04.448]  So I want to ask him, are there supplements?
[02:03:04.448 --> 02:03:05.128]  What can I do?
[02:03:05.128 --> 02:03:09.169]  And I've just got to get religious because every time I do what he says, it works.
[02:03:09.169 --> 02:03:09.870]  Look at Aaron, lost 95 pounds.
[02:03:11.448 --> 02:03:15.509]  Without, you know, going into one of those clinics and taking speed.
[02:03:15.509 --> 02:03:16.969]  My wife's had a dramatic response.
[02:03:16.969 --> 02:03:17.969]  My mother, my dad.
[02:03:17.969 --> 02:03:21.670]  If I will just follow this, then I'll have a great response.
[02:03:21.670 --> 02:03:29.532]  So I want to come back and get into the shootings and how he recommends people are able to phase off of serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:03:29.532 --> 02:03:35.773]  Because going right off of them, the inserts tell you, that'll make you even go more daffy duck where he bounces around and shoots off into the
[02:03:36.733 --> 02:03:39.736]  You know, atmosphere, or over the horizon.
[02:03:39.736 --> 02:03:41.138]  So, I'm no medical doctor.
[02:03:41.138 --> 02:03:47.784]  The medical doctors we've had on, and the psychologists, psychiatrists have said that are, you know, that are awake, do not go off these cold turkey.
[02:03:47.784 --> 02:03:50.007]  Whatever you do, I'm not giving that advice.
[02:03:50.007 --> 02:03:51.128]  That's what they say.
[02:03:51.128 --> 02:03:52.749]  I'm not giving any medical advice here.
[02:03:52.749 --> 02:03:54.931]  I'm just going off the research and what I would do.
[02:03:55.572 --> 02:04:07.429]  So we're going to talk about the mass shootings, how to get off of it, and then natural things that the, by the way, the FDA wants to ban, that in the placebo studies I've seen 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 times more effective in some cases.
[02:04:09.341 --> 02:04:12.945]  And it's not just melatonin.
[02:04:12.945 --> 02:04:16.969]  Also, good news for people that are depressed or whatever.
[02:04:16.969 --> 02:04:20.132]  We're all about solutions here, so that's why he's going to be joining us.
[02:04:20.132 --> 02:04:22.694]  And also, we're going to do some mid-air refueling.
[02:04:22.694 --> 02:04:29.280]  When you buy the Quality Longevity products, discounted at the lowest price available at Infowarshealth.com or Infowarsstore.com.

[02:04:41.684 --> 02:04:47.649]  So we can have a $100,000 contest, people to make films, to wake up America, Operation Paul Revere.
[02:04:47.649 --> 02:04:53.293]  So the funding that comes in lets us continue and expand and do more aggressive stuff in the face of the new world order.
[02:04:53.293 --> 02:04:58.758]  Because if I'm going to get killed fighting these people, which I hope doesn't happen, knock on wood, pray to Jesus, I'm going to go all the way.
[02:05:01.263 --> 02:05:06.346]  The New Year is a great time to take charge of your health and wellness.

[02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:06.111]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:06.111 --> 02:06:09.653]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.653 --> 02:06:12.454]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.454 --> 02:06:18.158]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:18.158 --> 02:06:24.821]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.821 --> 02:06:30.805]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[02:06:39.269 --> 02:06:45.210]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.210 --> 02:06:48.752]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.752 --> 02:06:50.732]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.732 --> 02:06:51.853]  It's here.

[02:07:00.492 --> 02:07:04.494]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[02:07:04.494 --> 02:07:11.997]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[02:07:11.997 --> 02:07:14.698]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:07:14.698 --> 02:07:21.301]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[02:07:21.301 --> 02:07:22.442]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[02:07:22.722 --> 02:07:31.752]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[02:07:31.752 --> 02:07:35.717]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[02:07:35.717 --> 02:07:37.579]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:07:37.779 --> 02:07:40.061]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[02:08:02.418 --> 02:08:04.240]  We are on the march.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:07.362]  The empire is on the run.
[02:08:07.362 --> 02:08:17.230]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.230 --> 02:08:31.022]  As I watch the socialists and communists working for foreign banks openly butcher the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution and shut down our jobs and pay to ship them overseas and I see my republic crank it up for me
[02:08:31.852 --> 02:08:34.793]  We're not having much time.
[02:08:34.793 --> 02:08:43.656]  Because at 5 o'clock, they take our Republic.
[02:08:43.656 --> 02:08:49.378]  The sands of time for our Republic and our families.
[02:08:49.378 --> 02:08:54.941]  And the entire world.
[02:08:54.941 --> 02:08:58.682]  The Black Wings of the New World Order spreading across the planet.
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:07.488]  Every form of tyranny is exploding into huge flames and incinerating all that is good.
[02:09:07.488 --> 02:09:10.531]  The general public is under scientific conditioning.
[02:09:10.531 --> 02:09:12.694]  Completely programmed.
[02:09:12.694 --> 02:09:17.239]  It's up to us not to laugh at them or to even get angry with them.
[02:09:17.239 --> 02:09:20.602]  It's up to us to shake them out of their trance.
[02:09:20.602 --> 02:09:21.824]  To shake them out of the spell.
[02:09:23.151 --> 02:09:26.814]  To awaken the brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:09:26.814 --> 02:09:32.198]  That's why we've launched Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant, where you can get 11
[02:09:33.783 --> 02:09:38.327]  PrisonPlanet.tv memberships for the price of one, $5.95 a month.
[02:09:38.327 --> 02:09:41.589]  That's less than 59 cents per person per month.
[02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:46.333]  You can create a username and passcode, give it to up to 10 more people.
[02:09:46.333 --> 02:09:51.697]  And that many can be simultaneously logged on to see the nightly news, to see all my films, to hear the show.
[02:09:51.697 --> 02:09:53.458]  We're having a huge effect already.
[02:09:53.458 --> 02:10:03.046]  But quite frankly, Operation Awake and the Sleeping Giant is nothing compared to Operation Paul Revere, launched about 25 minutes ago, last hour.
[02:10:03.646 --> 02:10:08.150]  At PrisonPlanet.com and at Infowars.com.
[02:10:08.150 --> 02:10:10.271]  Operation Paul Revere.
[02:10:10.271 --> 02:10:12.093]  Operation Paul Revere.
[02:10:12.093 --> 02:10:14.335]  Just absolutely turn loose.
[02:10:14.335 --> 02:10:16.196]  Tens of thousands.
[02:10:16.196 --> 02:10:19.639]  They have tens of thousands of entries for the Doritos contest.
[02:10:19.639 --> 02:10:22.822]  That's $100,000 for a stupid Doritos MSG ad.
[02:10:23.743 --> 02:10:24.643]  Okay.
[02:10:24.643 --> 02:10:27.405]  This is $100,000 first place cash.
[02:10:27.405 --> 02:10:29.306]  So you got to jump through more stuff with the Doritos.
[02:10:29.306 --> 02:10:30.326]  It's got to air.
[02:10:30.326 --> 02:10:32.387]  It's got to get certain ratings on the Super Bowl.
[02:10:32.387 --> 02:10:34.348]  Sometimes it doesn't, so you don't get all the money.
[02:10:34.348 --> 02:10:35.729]  This is just $100,000.
[02:10:35.729 --> 02:10:37.210]  I judge it.
[02:10:37.210 --> 02:10:40.151]  You got three months to produce the film.
[02:10:40.151 --> 02:10:42.072]  It could be three minutes long or two hours long.
[02:10:42.072 --> 02:10:43.553]  Three minutes to two hours.
[02:10:43.553 --> 02:10:44.693]  That's the area.
[02:10:44.693 --> 02:10:45.994]  It could be fiction, nonfiction.
[02:10:45.994 --> 02:10:48.195]  It's got to expose tyranny, promote liberty.
[02:10:48.195 --> 02:10:49.776]  The rules are up at Infowars.com.
[02:10:50.805 --> 02:10:53.346]  And all of you will win by exposing The Globalist.
[02:10:53.346 --> 02:10:55.347]  We're launching this right now.
[02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:56.728]  All of us will win by resisting.
[02:10:56.728 --> 02:10:58.389]  Thousands of films are going to get made.
[02:10:58.389 --> 02:11:03.031]  It's going to flood YouTube and one other online free video site.
[02:11:03.031 --> 02:11:06.373]  Pick the other.
[02:11:06.373 --> 02:11:07.674]  Pick whichever one you want.
[02:11:08.964 --> 02:11:10.085]  And just flood the internet.
[02:11:10.085 --> 02:11:10.685]  We all win.
[02:11:10.685 --> 02:11:11.566]  It's a giant rush.
[02:11:11.566 --> 02:11:13.187]  It's Operation Paul Revere.
[02:11:13.187 --> 02:11:14.828]  Ride out as Paul Revere.
[02:11:14.828 --> 02:11:25.034]  I mean, one example of a film is you could dress up like Paul Revere and actually ride around in the city at night, warning people that tyranny's happening and handing out from horseback, you know, documents about the New World Order takeover.
[02:11:25.034 --> 02:11:26.455]  I'm not saying that'll be the winner.
[02:11:26.455 --> 02:11:28.557]  It's just there's unlimited ideas.
[02:11:28.557 --> 02:11:29.717]  I'm actually planning to do that.
[02:11:29.717 --> 02:11:30.878]  I just, if I get the time.
[02:11:30.878 --> 02:11:31.999]  I got a thousand ideas.
[02:11:31.999 --> 02:11:33.220]  I know how to bring these people down.
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:35.321]  I know how to turn you loose.
[02:11:35.321 --> 02:11:36.642]  You know how to turn yourself loose.
[02:11:38.468 --> 02:11:40.169]  Operation Paul Revere.
[02:11:40.169 --> 02:11:41.831]  Operation Paul Revere.
[02:11:41.831 --> 02:11:43.472]  Operation Paul Revere.
[02:11:43.472 --> 02:11:44.993]  Operation Paul Revere.
[02:11:44.993 --> 02:11:46.815]  Launch dropped.
[02:11:46.815 --> 02:11:49.897]  And again, taking the capital that comes in, what's the best thing we can do?
[02:11:49.897 --> 02:11:51.158]  Launch a news program.
[02:11:51.158 --> 02:11:52.359]  Make films.
[02:11:52.359 --> 02:11:54.560]  Come out with a magazine.
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:55.721]  Make viral reports.
[02:11:55.721 --> 02:12:00.745]  I mean, I get 15 million listeners conservatively every week and that's growing.
[02:12:00.745 --> 02:12:01.486]  That's an old number.
[02:12:02.706 --> 02:12:04.668]  140 stations, gaining a couple new ones a week.
[02:12:04.668 --> 02:12:06.570]  In fact, I've got new stations I'm supposed to plug today.
[02:12:06.570 --> 02:12:07.772]  The week's gone by.
[02:12:07.772 --> 02:12:08.913]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:12:08.913 --> 02:12:10.495]  We're having an effect.
[02:12:10.495 --> 02:12:13.558]  And with good cheer, I stand against the enemy.
[02:12:13.558 --> 02:12:18.683]  If they kill me or set me up or whatever, take care of my family, keep the InfoWars operation going.
[02:12:18.683 --> 02:12:20.165]  We've got a plan for that.
[02:12:20.165 --> 02:12:21.046]  But don't.
[02:12:21.046 --> 02:12:23.889]  But understand, that's a sign of victory against the enemy.
[02:12:23.889 --> 02:12:24.749]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[02:12:25.290 --> 02:12:28.273]  The reason they have it is because they don't want to underline and highlight everything I've said.
[02:12:28.273 --> 02:12:29.955]  The point is, is that this is a fight.
[02:12:29.955 --> 02:12:31.836]  This is the fight I was born for.
[02:12:31.836 --> 02:12:33.718]  This is the fight you were born for.
[02:12:33.718 --> 02:12:40.084]  You're not meant to just watch TV and drink beer all day and have a good time and then get euthanized at some government facility.
[02:12:40.084 --> 02:12:43.067]  You're not meant to be some bureaucrat feeding on people all day.
[02:12:43.067 --> 02:12:45.109]  You're not meant to live like this.
[02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:48.332]  You're not meant to put your kids on Prozac and Ritalin.
[02:12:49.178 --> 02:12:53.143]  We're not meant to live like this, and this is the animating contest for liberty.
[02:12:53.143 --> 02:12:57.608]  I'm not happy about the tyranny getting so obvious, because I know how dark it is, but you know what?
[02:12:57.608 --> 02:12:58.970]  If that's the case, good.
[02:12:58.970 --> 02:12:59.931]  It's now out in the open.
[02:13:03.868 --> 02:13:10.936]  We're going to go now for the balance of the hour to one of my favorite guests and one of our listeners' favorite guest.
[02:13:10.936 --> 02:13:19.706]  He is pharmacist Ben Fuchs, was a mainline pharmacist for many years until he saw what it was doing to people and he's developed many different
[02:13:21.428 --> 02:13:26.030]  Products, different vitamin and mineral systems, skin systems, you name it.
[02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:29.012]  He's the host of the National Syndicated Radio Program on GCN, The Bright Side.
[02:13:29.012 --> 02:13:32.514]  The Bright Side, again, is on GCN the hour before I am.
[02:13:32.514 --> 02:13:40.658]  Fitz is a registered pharmacist, nutritionist, cosmetic chemist, and founder of the EconoComp Pharmacy and Rocky Mountain Natural Laboratories.
[02:13:40.658 --> 02:13:42.719]  He's a very successful pharmacist.
[02:13:42.719 --> 02:13:45.320]  Ben.com, BrightSideBen.com.
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:47.341]  And I'll just recap this if you just joined us.
[02:13:47.341 --> 02:13:48.562]  I'm driving in Tuesday morning.
[02:13:50.089 --> 02:13:55.496]  And I get ready at home, so it's about 10 o'clock I leave, it's about 10.20, 10.30 I get to the office.
[02:13:55.496 --> 02:13:56.898]  I gotta get in and do the show.
[02:13:56.898 --> 02:14:04.207]  I couldn't, I had to keep listening because he was covering what serotonin reuptake inhibitors do to the brain, what SRIs do, serotonin...
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:07.742]  You know, just the basic systems.
[02:14:07.742 --> 02:14:16.869]  He was breaking it down, and so I called him, I had Richard call him, and I said, I want to get you on about what you were breaking down, because I've had all these brain surgeons and scientists on, they've said the same thing.
[02:14:16.869 --> 02:14:20.171]  You say it's so concise, send me the documentation on that.
[02:14:20.171 --> 02:14:21.813]  I mean, I already know it, but send it to me.
[02:14:21.813 --> 02:14:33.622]  So he sent me this giant stack of inserts and documents and even mainstream news about placebos doing better than Prozac for you, and then many natural things really helping people that are depressed.
[02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:42.037]  So this is about solutions, and this is how people can safely, from the research, get off serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:14:42.037 --> 02:14:45.541]  And the natural things out there, the FDA is trying to block you from getting.
[02:14:45.541 --> 02:14:47.863]  Then I'm going to ask you about things that help with allergies.
[02:14:47.863 --> 02:14:56.372]  But again, I also have this report, and we'll show TV viewers a document cam shot, Yahoo Finance, Alabama International,
[02:14:57.997 --> 02:15:06.235]  AL International announces results of longevity clinical research studies performed by Clemson University Institute of Nutraceutical Research.
[02:15:07.248 --> 02:15:10.530]  Unbelievable findings in scientific double-blind studies.
[02:15:37.288 --> 02:15:45.534]  Okay, so we're going to go over this, also talk about what he would do for say, Cedar Allergy, or really Mountain Juniper, but they call it Cedar Allergy.
[02:15:45.534 --> 02:15:48.276]  I'm going to pick his brain about that.
[02:15:48.276 --> 02:15:51.238]  And again, Ben joins us and I've got some of the questions.
[02:15:51.238 --> 02:15:55.360]  I said, send me questions that I should ask so I can understand this better and for people.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.861]  So let's talk about the shootings.
[02:15:56.861 --> 02:16:03.886]  Let's talk about what SSRIs are doing and other psychotropics and antipsychotics that roughly 20% of the country's on.
[02:16:03.886 --> 02:16:05.908]  And then let's talk about, from his research,
[02:16:06.608 --> 02:16:13.469]  What has successfully helped people get off these and actually help people not be depressed in this Orwellian system?
[02:16:13.469 --> 02:16:15.930]  What the FDA doesn't want you to know about?
[02:16:15.930 --> 02:16:19.471]  Okay, so Pharmacist Ben joins us right now.
[02:16:19.471 --> 02:16:20.731]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:16:20.731 --> 02:16:21.771]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[02:16:21.771 --> 02:16:22.811]  It's a pleasure.
[02:16:22.811 --> 02:16:29.333]  Okay, we're going to break in about four minutes, so start getting into these chemicals, what they're doing, the inserts say they make you mass murder.
[02:16:29.333 --> 02:16:30.193]  Why?
[02:16:30.193 --> 02:16:36.014]  The answer is give Big Pharma more money, more access to kids, to stop mass shootings, always connected to these drugs.
[02:16:36.690 --> 02:16:53.256]  Well, the most important thing, Alex, for people to recognize is that far from the happy, bliss-inducing, joy-inducing neurotransmitter hormone substance that serotonin is portrayed to be by the mainstream media and by mainstream medical professionals, it turns out that serotonin is a hormone of vigilance.
[02:16:53.256 --> 02:16:54.657]  It's a hormone of awareness.
[02:16:54.657 --> 02:16:59.038]  It's a hormone that's designed to keep us on our toes, so to speak.
[02:16:59.038 --> 02:17:05.501]  It's a daytime hormone that's designed to keep us able to handle the ups and downs and the vicissitudes of day-to-day life.
[02:17:06.101 --> 02:17:23.972]  So when you start to monkey around with the serotonin system, what you're monkeying around with is the awareness system, and the end result of too much serotonin is hyper-awareness, hyper-vigilance, paranoia, and this sense that, this hyper-focused sense that people have when they're freaking out.
[02:17:23.972 --> 02:17:25.873]  Artificial schizophrenia.
[02:17:25.873 --> 02:17:27.374]  It's like a type of schizophrenia.
[02:17:27.374 --> 02:17:31.156]  In fact, LSD is very similar to serotonin.
[02:17:31.156 --> 02:17:32.057]  It's in the same class.
[02:17:33.077 --> 02:17:35.140]  Same class, basically the same substance.
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:37.062]  Basically it's the same molecule.
[02:17:37.062 --> 02:17:51.196]  And if you want to know what the effects of too much serotonin are, the kind of effects that you get when you start to manipulate the serotonin clearing system, which is how these SSRI drugs are, think of the last time you saw somebody on some kind of LSD trip.
[02:17:52.197 --> 02:17:58.744]  LSD was actually discovered when they were researching ways to manipulate the serotonin system.
[02:17:58.744 --> 02:18:06.011]  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is involved with the vigilance response.
[02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:10.356]  Now, you obviously need to have this vigilance response, but you've got to be very, very careful with it.
[02:18:11.557 --> 02:18:17.864]  Serotonin is largely produced by stress cells in the digestive system.
[02:18:17.864 --> 02:18:31.757]  Your digestive system is always on the alert for poisons and for toxins, and you have these stress cells, cells that are literally similar to adrenal cells, that produce serotonin just waiting for you to eat some kind of poison or some kind of toxin.
[02:18:31.757 --> 02:18:33.779]  Is that why Prozac is linked to diabetes?
[02:18:34.802 --> 02:18:37.065]  Prozac is linked to diabetes for other reasons.
[02:18:37.065 --> 02:18:39.087]  We can get into that in a moment.
[02:18:39.087 --> 02:18:40.468]  That's a very important point.
[02:18:40.468 --> 02:18:44.172]  But that's why Prozac is used as an appetite suppressant.
[02:18:44.172 --> 02:18:50.719]  Prozac and serotonin has an effect on the digestive system that is much bigger than the effect that it has on the brain.
[02:18:50.719 --> 02:18:56.845]  In fact, 90% plus of the serotonin in your body is actually produced by these stress cells in the digestive system.
[02:18:57.305 --> 02:19:06.310]  So this feeling of butterflies in your stomach, the feeling of nervousness that you have before you have a date or stage fright, these are all serotonin mediated.
[02:19:06.310 --> 02:19:11.913]  They are the alert response that's produced by serotonin in these digestive stress cells.
[02:19:11.913 --> 02:19:16.416]  In the brain, serotonin is involved in the wakefulness response.
[02:19:16.476 --> 02:19:16.556]  Yes.
[02:19:31.513 --> 02:19:44.260]  Alright, we gotta go to break, but from my research, because you're the big pharmacist and the expert, but what other experts have told me, after you've been on these drugs a while, though, it burns you out, then they put you usually on more, then you're in a hyper-awake form of sleep.
[02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:56.746]  You're in a dream state, or daydreaming state, but hyper-awake, having a hallucination, and that's why people then go and use a meat cleaver to chop up their one-year-old baby and drink the blood, when the woman was a Sunday school teacher.
[02:19:56.746 --> 02:19:57.847]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:20:01.229 --> 02:20:02.650]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.650 --> 02:20:13.317]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:20:13.317 --> 02:20:20.521]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[02:20:20.521 --> 02:20:27.446]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area and
[02:20:27.466 --> 02:20:31.789]  Don't support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:20:31.789 --> 02:20:35.271]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:20:35.271 --> 02:20:41.414]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:41.414 --> 02:20:51.320]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:52.801]  The war is here.
[02:20:52.801 --> 02:20:54.122]  It's an info war.
[02:20:54.702 --> 02:20:59.764]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:20:59.764 --> 02:21:02.044]  Hi there.
[02:21:02.044 --> 02:21:03.565]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:21:03.565 --> 02:21:07.426]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:21:07.426 --> 02:21:16.549]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:21:16.549 --> 02:21:22.551]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:21:23.251 --> 02:21:25.453]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:21:25.453 --> 02:21:31.318]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:21:31.318 --> 02:21:38.324]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:21:39.261 --> 02:21:44.824]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[02:21:44.824 --> 02:21:51.327]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:21:51.327 --> 02:21:57.111]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:21:57.111 --> 02:21:58.271]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:22:00.558 --> 02:22:06.740]  HempUSA.org has a newly designed website and a new and improved detoxification product.

[02:22:30.271 --> 02:22:31.512]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.512 --> 02:22:36.075]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.075 --> 02:22:41.899]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.899 --> 02:22:45.541]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.541 --> 02:22:48.363]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.363 --> 02:22:53.306]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:53.306 --> 02:22:53.607]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.607 --> 02:22:54.968]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.772 --> 02:23:01.532]  Food storage?
[02:23:01.532 --> 02:23:02.093]  Check.
[02:23:02.093 --> 02:23:03.073]  Survival tools?

[02:23:03.654 --> 02:23:04.935]  Weapons and water filters?
[02:23:04.935 --> 02:23:05.616]  Check.
[02:23:05.616 --> 02:23:11.801]  But what about a permanent source of cooking power that can run forever without buying fuel or paying for maintenance?
[02:23:11.801 --> 02:23:17.966]  Introducing Afterburner Stoves, home of the original patented Rocket Stove, the Kelly Kettle, and the Solo Stove.

[02:23:50.405 --> 02:23:52.748]  Cook hot meals with just a handful of sticks!
[02:24:08.266 --> 02:24:11.168]  Again, I got a guest on like Dr. Corsi or Ben Fuchs.
[02:24:11.168 --> 02:24:20.054]  I just want to keep backing up what they're saying, but from the mainline research I've read, explain to me if it's hyper-awareness psychotropic in the hallucinogen class.
[02:24:20.054 --> 02:24:37.866]  Again, Alex Jones here with Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, talking about these mass shootings and almost every case of people chopping up their kids, drowning them, killing them, women who never had a criminal record, Sunday school, they get depressed, put them on the drugs, a year later they kill all four of their kids, you see it in the news, and they still send them to prison.
[02:24:38.426 --> 02:24:40.567]  The guy that killed 18 Afghans.
[02:24:40.567 --> 02:24:41.567]  Who had his foot blown off.
[02:24:41.567 --> 02:24:42.327]  He didn't want to go back.
[02:24:42.327 --> 02:24:43.728]  Fourth tour of the sergeant.
[02:24:43.728 --> 02:24:44.928]  They put him on psychotropics.
[02:24:44.928 --> 02:24:47.449]  They won't release which ones.
[02:24:47.449 --> 02:24:49.590]  But he was under psychiatric care on them.
[02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:52.190]  And he flips out one night and goes and kills people.
[02:24:52.190 --> 02:24:57.112]  So if it's hyper-awake, how does it make you then not remember Pharmacist Ben Fuchs?
[02:24:58.625 --> 02:25:04.948]  Hyper-awake is one component of serotonin, but its real role is to help you handle shock and help you handle stress.
[02:25:04.948 --> 02:25:10.790]  So one of the mechanisms for handling stress is hyper-awareness, but another one is withdrawal.
[02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:13.290]  Another one is getting away from the situation.
[02:25:13.290 --> 02:25:14.831]  Another one is becoming numb down.
[02:25:15.231 --> 02:25:22.716]  So these are all mechanisms that the body has for dealing with overwhelm, for dealing with stress, for dealing with some kind of shock.
[02:25:22.716 --> 02:25:27.379]  And this is what serotonin is, and that's why you never want to play around with this system.
[02:25:27.379 --> 02:25:35.004]  Especially considering, by the way, Alex, that people suffer from serotonin depletion for lifestyle reasons, for reasons of choice.
[02:25:35.004 --> 02:25:38.607]  They suffer from serotonin depletion from too much sugar, for one.
[02:25:38.607 --> 02:25:41.188]  They suffer from serotonin depletion from not enough sun.
[02:25:41.188 --> 02:25:44.891]  Do you know the sun is one of the most important ways to build your own serotonin?
[02:25:45.031 --> 02:25:46.292]  I was depressed last week.
[02:25:46.292 --> 02:25:47.232]  Went and got a ton of sun.
[02:25:47.232 --> 02:25:49.894]  I feel like I could take on a grizzly bear right now.
[02:25:49.894 --> 02:25:51.535]  Break down what the sun does.
[02:25:51.535 --> 02:25:52.996]  Go through the metabolic facts.
[02:25:52.996 --> 02:25:54.497]  It's not like this is a secret.
[02:25:54.497 --> 02:25:57.899]  Big Pharma knows this, but the sun's free.
[02:25:57.899 --> 02:26:00.901]  All these vitamins that can give you all the stuff you need.
[02:26:00.901 --> 02:26:05.104]  Break down that one chemical you were talking about that's so key to giving you the good chemicals you need.
[02:26:06.101 --> 02:26:06.901]  I'm not sure what you mean.
[02:26:06.901 --> 02:26:23.585]  Well, there are so many, but... Well, the point about the sun is, we're convinced, we're bamboozled to believe that the sun is some kind of demon in the sky that's hell-bent on our destruction, when the fact of the matter is that through substances like serotonin, the sun is an anabolic stimulus.
[02:26:23.585 --> 02:26:25.786]  It turns on growth, it turns on building.
[02:26:26.506 --> 02:26:28.148]  It's much the same with cholesterol.
[02:26:28.148 --> 02:26:29.089]  Cholesterol is the same way.
[02:26:29.089 --> 02:26:30.130]  It turns on growth.
[02:26:30.130 --> 02:26:31.192]  It turns on building.
[02:26:31.192 --> 02:26:40.863]  So, via these messages that we get through the media and through mainstream physicians and the medical model for staying out of the sun and using cholesterol lowering drugs and not eating cholesterol,
[02:26:41.303 --> 02:26:44.985]  We're almost like we're being systematically destroyed.
[02:26:44.985 --> 02:26:46.365]  Humanity is being crushed.
[02:26:46.365 --> 02:26:54.349]  Our ability to grow, our ability to repair, our ability to recover, our ability to thrive is being suppressed by this kind of wrong information.
[02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:59.112]  So the sun, much like cholesterol, is not the enemy that it's portrayed to be.
[02:26:59.112 --> 02:27:03.514]  And via serotonin, the sun actually turns on the production of serotonin.
[02:27:03.514 --> 02:27:10.377]  So if you're considering an SSRI drug, you'd be far better off getting yourself 20 minutes of sun or getting a sun lamp
[02:27:10.837 --> 02:27:19.524]  Getting something that produces blue light, which seems to be much more effective for producing serotonin than any other light, and laying out in the sun without a sunscreen.
[02:27:19.524 --> 02:27:31.213]  The last thing you ever want to do, by the way, if you're interested in building your serotonin, is wear a sunscreen because the sun, the sunscreen blocks the ultraviolet rays that turn on the production of this incredibly important substance.
[02:27:31.213 --> 02:27:37.538]  I would present to you that one of the main reasons we're dealing with serotonin problems is because we're so terrified of getting out in the sun.
[02:27:40.731 --> 02:27:44.493]  Continue breaking this information down.
[02:27:44.493 --> 02:27:45.854]  Melatonin is another one.
[02:27:45.854 --> 02:27:48.555]  Melatonin is converted from serotonin.
[02:27:48.555 --> 02:27:56.860]  So once your serotonin levels start to drop from things like not getting out in the sun or poor dietary strategies, then your melatonin levels drop as well.
[02:27:56.860 --> 02:28:01.922]  Then you deal with insomnia, then you deal with problems with waking up in the middle of the night.
[02:28:01.922 --> 02:28:06.525]  Melatonin is one of the most powerful anti-aging substances, antioxidant substances,
[02:28:07.065 --> 02:28:07.485]  I think so.
[02:28:28.258 --> 02:28:28.358]  Yes.
[02:28:46.175 --> 02:29:02.283]  Artificially manipulating your serotonin levels increases the likelihood of this sensation of learned helplessness and to me this is one of the most insidious features of these SSRI drugs and could very well be linked to the feelings of rage and violent behavior that a lot of people on Prozac and Zoloft are...
[02:29:02.503 --> 02:29:09.926]  We've got to go to break, but when we come back in the long segment with Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, listening to your show, you talked about 5-HTP.
[02:29:09.926 --> 02:29:12.226]  I'd love to say, hey, go to Infowarshealth.com.
[02:29:12.226 --> 02:29:18.889]  We've got products that have this for you, which there are some that help kick that in, but it's steaks, it's eggs, it's all these things, and I'm not bashing
[02:29:19.369 --> 02:29:20.230]  Vegetarianism
[02:29:34.506 --> 02:29:40.688]  And the healthiest, because I gotta be honest, I ate a ton of meat, a ton of eggs, and I feel like I could stomp King Kong to the ground.
[02:29:40.688 --> 02:29:47.910]  And I run into vegetarians, and I mean, they're ready to literally, you know, just hand me their car keys and let me slut their throat.
[02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:50.330]  We'll be right back with pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:29:50.330 --> 02:29:51.711]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.711 --> 02:29:54.251]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.251 --> 02:29:56.912]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.064 --> 02:30:11.171]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[02:33:01.087 --> 02:33:06.133]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.387 --> 02:33:19.014]  We got a story up at InfoWars.com, reposted by William F. Jasper, who we need to get back on the show.
[02:33:19.014 --> 02:33:21.676]  Just incredible articles over there at the New American.
[02:33:21.676 --> 02:33:25.399]  Communists cheer on Obama's gun grab.
[02:33:25.399 --> 02:33:27.681]  And it's just incredible.
[02:33:27.681 --> 02:33:35.427]  I forgot to tell you, the Communist Party USA, who I've caught on video in New York, some of their reported members.
[02:33:35.427 --> 02:33:36.708]  It's in my film, Martial Law.
[02:33:37.898 --> 02:33:39.339]  Just saying, get out of here!
[02:33:39.339 --> 02:33:42.862]  And they went on to say, you know, we're going to kill you like Stalin did.
[02:33:42.862 --> 02:33:45.505]  And I've told this story, and it's no exaggeration.
[02:33:45.505 --> 02:33:46.385]  Let me just be conservative.
[02:33:46.385 --> 02:33:52.511]  20 times I can remember or more, I've had communists come up and tell me that when they take over, I'm dead.
[02:33:52.511 --> 02:33:56.334]  I mean, their religion is how they're going to kill us.
[02:33:56.334 --> 02:34:00.958]  And so again, that's also at newamerican.com, but up at drugreport.com.
[02:34:00.958 --> 02:34:03.861]  Communists cheer on Obama's gun grab.
[02:34:05.718 --> 02:34:08.382]  And there it is, right there.
[02:34:08.382 --> 02:34:15.672]  We syndicate some of their better reports, and even had Bob Dacey, one of their writers, in studio last week, a fellow Austinite.
[02:34:15.672 --> 02:34:21.880]  And it's got links to all of it, and to the official peoplesworld.org saying, take our guns.
[02:34:23.150 --> 02:34:31.358]  Unbelievable information up at DrudgeReport.com, easiest place to find it, because I think this has already scrolled off our featured news from this morning.
[02:34:31.358 --> 02:34:32.919]  Which is a problem with InfoWars.
[02:34:32.919 --> 02:34:39.405]  It's not a problem, but we're going to redesign Prison Planet as a test, with a big, you know, official company, and then redesign some things.
[02:34:39.405 --> 02:34:41.787]  And if that works, good, we're going to go to InfoWars with a redesign.
[02:34:41.787 --> 02:34:43.128]  Still the basic look that's popular.
[02:34:43.809 --> 02:34:48.072]  But if you go to the top of InfoWars.com, which we can punch up, you'll see two links here.
[02:34:48.072 --> 02:34:50.973]  Breaking News, that's the total RSS News Feed.
[02:34:50.973 --> 02:35:01.980]  And I think I'm going to change that red link to the Top Stories, because the stories we write are the stuff that we think is most important, probably 20 or 30 of them a day, depending on how many we put out, go in this.
[02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:06.543]  And every five or six hours, on average, the top six or seven stories scroll through.
[02:35:06.543 --> 02:35:13.207]  Oh, I just noticed that the Top Story area
[02:35:15.552 --> 02:35:17.935]  Or he must have just written a new article about that.
[02:35:17.935 --> 02:35:21.098]  InfoWars launches Operation Paul Revere.
[02:35:21.098 --> 02:35:24.082]  Kissinger predicts nuclear war with Iran.
[02:35:24.082 --> 02:35:28.026]  Sheriff refuses to enforce unconstitutional executive orders in Arizona County.
[02:35:28.026 --> 02:35:32.211]  Airport terror announcements now being played in hotels.
[02:35:32.211 --> 02:35:35.935]  TSA conducts random checks at Austin train station.
[02:35:36.836 --> 02:35:46.186]  Population Control Advocacy Group, Humans Equal Locust, Illinois citizens still being arrested for filming police in their own yard, by the way.
[02:35:46.186 --> 02:35:50.611]  For filming cops while they put a smart meter on their house without a warrant.
[02:35:50.611 --> 02:35:53.694]  Communist cheer on Obama's gun grab.
[02:35:53.694 --> 02:35:55.376]  That already has scrolled off the front page.
[02:35:55.876 --> 02:35:57.678]  Feinstein declares war on Bill of Rights.
[02:35:57.678 --> 02:36:00.920]  Calls for American citizens to be disarmed or registered.
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:01.401]  Urgent.
[02:36:01.401 --> 02:36:05.944]  Big agri-group trying to ban raw sales of milk in South Carolina.
[02:36:05.944 --> 02:36:07.185]  Private sales.
[02:36:07.185 --> 02:36:09.987]  Muslim Brotherhood propped up by the government.
[02:36:09.987 --> 02:36:13.450]  Man who brought down Akron tells all.
[02:36:13.450 --> 02:36:14.571]  Defiant sheriffs.
[02:36:14.571 --> 02:36:21.016]  Just dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of them now standing up all over this great land from the north to the south to the east to the west.
[02:36:21.016 --> 02:36:25.140]  They're trying to say owning guns is a southern thing and try to play us off against each other.
[02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:30.225]  New Yorkers and everybody else are coming together and saying, how dare you bash people in the South?
[02:36:30.225 --> 02:36:31.306]  We're all Americans.
[02:36:31.306 --> 02:36:33.228]  We're not hyphenated like you want us to be.
[02:36:33.228 --> 02:36:35.270]  We're not going to have a race war like you want.
[02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:36.432]  You're not getting our guns.
[02:36:36.432 --> 02:36:40.196]  And I've seen so many black folks, and veterans mainly, all over YouTube.
[02:36:40.196 --> 02:36:41.117]  I'm not even looking for it.
[02:36:41.117 --> 02:36:41.838]  Every day I see like...
[02:36:43.819 --> 02:36:49.662]  20 really strong, smart, super well-spoken, on-air radio show black guys.
[02:36:49.662 --> 02:36:54.964]  Just all over YouTube going, we're not socialist, we're not globalist, we're not turning our guns in.
[02:36:54.964 --> 02:36:56.165]  We know what's going on.
[02:36:56.165 --> 02:36:57.245]  We know what's happening.
[02:36:57.245 --> 02:36:58.486]  We know the fraud.
[02:36:58.486 --> 02:36:59.666]  We know about eugenics.
[02:36:59.666 --> 02:37:00.447]  I mean, it's exciting.
[02:37:01.351 --> 02:37:01.891]  It's exciting.
[02:37:01.891 --> 02:37:05.933]  Okay, I'm going to shut up and go back to our guest, Ben Fuchs.
[02:37:05.933 --> 02:37:09.735]  I'm glad Drudge linked to that, because I saw that article this morning and wanted to talk about it.
[02:37:09.735 --> 02:37:10.476]  Look at all these stacks.
[02:37:10.476 --> 02:37:11.596]  I mean, there's hundreds of articles.
[02:37:11.596 --> 02:37:12.337]  It's all insane.
[02:37:12.337 --> 02:37:15.518]  I'm going to cover a lot of special stuff tonight on the Nightly News.
[02:37:15.518 --> 02:37:19.740]  We've got the reporters doing the news, but I'm going to have a special report on a couple things.
[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:20.401]  Ben Fuchs.
[02:37:21.431 --> 02:37:29.915]  Like, this is your radio show now, because I'm actually going to turn off the microphone and walk out of the room, because this gets me so angry and so excited that I'll start cutting into you.
[02:37:29.915 --> 02:37:37.919]  In the rest of this segment, get into the tryptophan and the fact that they don't, you know, what's in meat, they don't want us getting that.
[02:37:37.919 --> 02:37:50.466]  Explain to somebody on Prozac, I know you're not their doctor or pharmacist, but what you would do personally, I say Prozac, the whole class of dozens of, what is it, 30 or 40 of these on the market or more right now, some numbers are over 70, but they're not
[02:37:50.686 --> 02:37:50.886]  Why is
[02:38:05.623 --> 02:38:07.703]  Every woman I knew on it was a nymphomaniac.
[02:38:07.703 --> 02:38:10.024]  I don't want to get into details here, but I didn't like that.
[02:38:10.024 --> 02:38:11.184]  I want the real woman.
[02:38:11.184 --> 02:38:14.765]  I want the real personality, not like some biological android.
[02:38:14.765 --> 02:38:16.365]  Why does this?
[02:38:16.365 --> 02:38:20.606]  Obviously, they want more crazy people, so they want to put you on something that makes you crazy.
[02:38:20.606 --> 02:38:26.688]  What are things out there naturally that would actually help people because of the deficiencies in this toxic system?
[02:38:26.688 --> 02:38:27.588]  You have the floor.
[02:38:27.588 --> 02:38:28.068]  Break it down.
[02:38:28.424 --> 02:38:33.686]  Well, there's so many ways, and we'll talk about that in a second, but I want people on SSRIs to understand this.
[02:38:33.686 --> 02:38:36.967]  The chemical imbalance theory of depression.
[02:38:36.967 --> 02:38:43.069]  The idea that depression is caused by a lack of serotonin and that you build your serotonin, you're not depressed.
[02:38:43.069 --> 02:38:44.930]  Number one, it's simplistic and naive.
[02:38:44.930 --> 02:38:48.171]  And number two, it's never been shown to be the case.
[02:38:48.171 --> 02:38:53.233]  In fact, drugs that block serotonin have been shown to have antidepressant activity.
[02:38:53.413 --> 02:38:53.593]  Yes.
[02:39:14.817 --> 02:39:29.648]  Elevations in serotonin, super high levels of serotonin, such as the kind that are caused by artificially manipulating the serotonin system, are associated with agitation, with restlessness, with diarrhea, with hallucinations, with fast heartbeat.
[02:39:29.648 --> 02:39:37.814]  Serotonin itself, the very word serotonin, means sero for blood, tonin for tightening.
[02:39:37.814 --> 02:39:43.338]  That's because serotonin's classic effect is blood clotting and hypertension.
[02:39:43.558 --> 02:39:44.719]  Let me say that again.
[02:39:44.719 --> 02:39:51.544]  Serotonin's classic effect on the body is blood clotting and hypertension, and it's in the very name, serotonin.
[02:39:51.544 --> 02:40:11.558]  Now, blood clotting and hypertension are two iconic signs of the body's stress response, and given the fact that 80 million or more Americans are hypertensive, and some of the best-selling drugs on the planet are blood-thinning drugs, and among the most toxic drugs, so clearly blood clotting and hypertension are big problems in this country.
[02:40:11.558 --> 02:40:12.339]  It seems to me
[02:40:12.979 --> 02:40:26.205]  Anybody who's considering taking a drug that would manipulate serotonin levels, that would up serotonin levels, that would increase the amount of this neurotransmitter that's associated with blood clotting and hypertension, would want to think twice.
[02:40:26.205 --> 02:40:30.367]  Especially considering that this chemical imbalance theory has never been shown to be the case.
[02:40:30.367 --> 02:40:37.971]  Now what we do know is that serotonin is a hormone of awareness, it's a hormone of vigilance, it is a summertime hormone.
[02:40:38.271 --> 02:40:40.634]  It is a daytime hormone.
[02:40:40.634 --> 02:40:48.582]  It is associated with the sun and it's associated with light, which is why the best way to get your serotonin is to make sure you're getting some sunlight.
[02:40:48.582 --> 02:40:53.447]  And not only that, take your sunglasses off and make sure you're looking at the sun.
[02:40:53.447 --> 02:40:53.888]  Absolutely.
[02:40:54.228 --> 02:41:03.291]  The rays from the sun, the photonic energy from the sun will go through your eyes, it'll go into your brain, and it will help upregulate serotonin production.
[02:41:03.291 --> 02:41:10.314]  In addition, Alex, as you mentioned, there's wonderful, wonderful nutritional strategies that you can use to upregulate your serotonin system.
[02:41:10.954 --> 02:41:20.221]  Earlier we talked about how digestive stress cells, they're called enterochromaffin cells, are the largest producers of serotonin in the body.
[02:41:20.221 --> 02:41:36.173]  One of the best ways that you can make sure that your serotonin system is running cleanly is to eliminate problem foods, number one, and that means any kind of foods that the body will perceive as a toxin, that is processed foods, that is things like excitotoxins, MSG for example, artificial flavors.
[02:41:36.833 --> 02:41:41.458]  And secondly, make sure you're addressing something called H. pylori.
[02:41:41.458 --> 02:41:55.994]  H. pylori is a bacteria that overgrows in the digestive tract as we get older and as our digestive system becomes more compromised, as our acid production in our digestive system and our stomach starts to become compromised, this bacteria overgrows and that is a
[02:41:56.354 --> 02:42:00.857]  Big time stressor on the serotonin system, the digestive serotonin system.
[02:42:00.857 --> 02:42:16.866]  So addressing your digestive system by clearing out H. pylori using things like apple cider vinegar for example, digestive enzymes for example, probiotics, unbelievably important for supporting digestive health and supporting the serotonin, the digestive serotonin system.
[02:42:16.866 --> 02:42:18.406]  Then there's the supplements that you could take.
[02:42:18.406 --> 02:42:20.528]  You mentioned 5-HTP and tryptophan.
[02:42:21.368 --> 02:42:21.728]  We're good to go!
[02:42:42.535 --> 02:42:45.116]  Well, serotonin starts off with tryptophan.
[02:42:45.116 --> 02:42:48.016]  Tryptophan gets one piece stuck on and it becomes 5-HTP or 5-hydroxytryptophan.
[02:42:48.016 --> 02:42:49.677]  You stick another piece on it and it becomes serotonin.
[02:42:49.677 --> 02:42:50.897]  But it all starts from tryptophan.
[02:43:11.081 --> 02:43:11.241]  Yes.
[02:43:31.224 --> 02:43:31.844]  That's right.
[02:43:46.172 --> 02:43:46.712]  That's right.
[02:44:01.561 --> 02:44:01.641]  Yes.
[02:44:24.785 --> 02:44:28.046]  It's crazy cheap.
[02:44:28.046 --> 02:44:31.628]  It's like $10 or $15 for a 3 month supply.
[02:44:31.628 --> 02:44:37.110]  You take about 100mg or 200mg a night and that too will boost your serotonin.
[02:44:37.110 --> 02:44:41.111]  Now when it comes to making serotonin in the brain, it's not just protein.
[02:44:41.111 --> 02:44:47.013]  Even though serotonin comes from tryptophan, it's not just protein foods that help you build serotonin.
[02:44:47.013 --> 02:44:49.414]  You actually have to have carbohydrate.
[02:44:49.894 --> 02:44:50.535]  We're good to go!
[02:45:05.188 --> 02:45:10.390]  Big, big problem, and there's an important relationship between sugar intake and serotonin.
[02:45:10.390 --> 02:45:15.192]  When you eat sugar, this is perceived biochemically by the body as a major stress.
[02:45:15.192 --> 02:45:17.773]  Sugar is very, very explosive stuff.
[02:45:17.773 --> 02:45:24.035]  If you ever put a marshmallow in a fire, and you see the marshmallow go poof, you can see how explosive sugar is.
[02:45:24.035 --> 02:45:29.317]  Well, in the body, that same kind of explosivity, that same kind of explosive reaction occurs,
[02:45:29.817 --> 02:45:42.099]  And so when you eat sugar, especially fast-burning sugars, dessert kinds of sugars, soda pop kinds of sugars, the body's stress response is triggered, and this stress response involves serotonin.
[02:45:42.099 --> 02:45:47.580]  In fact, the hormone insulin and the hormone serotonin work hand-in-hand.
[02:45:47.580 --> 02:45:53.341]  And today we have a big problem, maybe the biggest health crisis of all, is something called insulin resistance.
[02:45:53.341 --> 02:45:58.362]  And this is when the body stops listening to insulin and going hand-in-hand with insulin resistance.
[02:45:58.922 --> 02:45:59.622]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:46:18.112 --> 02:46:29.142]  You want to make sure you're having some carbohydrate with your protein, you want to make sure it's fibery carbohydrate, you want to make sure you're getting enough protein, especially tryptophan-containing protein, and you want to make sure that you're getting 5-HTP.
[02:46:29.142 --> 02:46:36.349]  Now, in addition to all of this, there are co-factors that the brain uses, the body uses, to help make serotonin.
[02:46:36.349 --> 02:46:44.016]  Chief among these is vitamin C and the B-complex, especially vitamin B6, and to a little bit lesser extent, minerals like zinc and magnesium.
[02:46:44.196 --> 02:46:47.738]  That's why you need to take the Beyond Tangy Tangerine at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[02:46:47.738 --> 02:46:48.638]  I mean, it's simple.
[02:46:48.638 --> 02:46:56.962]  My children act like demons if I let them have processed sugar, but when we are on the job and only feed them organic and healthy food, they're little angels, and everything's great.
[02:46:56.962 --> 02:47:02.224]  If I'm on the road and I'm dumb enough to eat a piece of cake or something, I feel like I have a hangover the next day.
[02:47:02.224 --> 02:47:10.067]  Going over this, and people go to InfoWarsHealth.com, there's many of the products you and others and Dr. Wallach have formulated, and this is no joke, folks.
[02:47:10.067 --> 02:47:10.668]  What would you...
[02:47:11.368 --> 02:47:20.353]  Again, we're not giving them the advice they should, because it's very dangerous to go off the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and we have a report here we're going to show people in a moment.
[02:47:20.353 --> 02:47:28.378]  What would you do if you were, say, a 35-year-old man or woman who's been on psychotropics for, say, six years.
[02:47:28.378 --> 02:47:34.482]  They've got you on three of them because, quote, the others didn't work, and you don't know who you are anymore.
[02:47:35.442 --> 02:47:38.144]  And, you know, you're kind of eating a regular McDonald's diet.
[02:47:38.144 --> 02:47:53.416]  What would be just the brief process that Ben Fuchs, and again, my dad's a dentist, oral surgeon, the people he respects more than anybody aren't even doctors and people, it's pharmacists, because he knows, especially long-time master pharmacists, you guys kill people if you make a mistake.
[02:47:53.416 --> 02:48:00.162]  And so you guys really went to school to actually know what the drugs do, you know, I don't know, 20, 30 times what doctors do.
[02:48:00.162 --> 02:48:02.604]  So, I mean, that's why you're the guy to talk to on this.
[02:48:03.084 --> 02:48:08.601]  What are the dangers of going off the serotonin reuptake inhibitors or other antipsychotic classes?
[02:48:09.315 --> 02:48:12.797]  Well, first of all, we have to understand how serotonin reuptake inhibitors work.
[02:48:12.797 --> 02:48:17.419]  When the brain secretes serotonin, it immediately sucks that serotonin back up again.
[02:48:17.419 --> 02:48:22.621]  So serotonin will get released and then it will get uptaken, reuptaken.
[02:48:22.621 --> 02:48:28.043]  It will get sucked up again, back up again into the nerves so that it doesn't have too much of an effect.
[02:48:28.043 --> 02:48:32.285]  This is called reuptake and it's a standard process that occurs in the body, or in the brain.
[02:48:34.126 --> 02:48:34.846]  Exactly.
[02:48:34.846 --> 02:48:40.169]  Reuptake inhibitors inhibit that process, so the serotonin stays in the system.
[02:48:40.169 --> 02:48:42.009]  It creates a chemical imbalance.
[02:48:42.009 --> 02:48:43.690]  A major chemical imbalance.
[02:48:43.690 --> 02:48:46.911]  That serotonin is artificially kept active.
[02:48:46.911 --> 02:48:54.314]  So you get off your serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and because this uptake mechanism has been shut down, now you've got all of this serotonin that has left
[02:48:56.315 --> 02:49:04.356]  The nerve cells, you run into a major, major risk of serotonin depletion because the serotonin is not getting taken up back into the cells.
[02:49:04.356 --> 02:49:18.139]  So you want to make sure, if you're going to get off of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, that you wean yourself off of them very slowly and you build your serotonin levels back up by, number one, making sure you're getting out in the sun.
[02:49:18.139 --> 02:49:21.720]  Make sure you get 10 or 15 minutes of sun, three or four days a week.
[02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:24.260]  You don't want to burn, but you want to make sure that you're getting some sun.
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:26.740]  President Prozac is climbing mountains, I'm telling you right now.
[02:49:27.356 --> 02:49:27.816]  Absolutely.
[02:49:27.816 --> 02:49:31.139]  The ultimate Prozac is the great outdoors, nature and the divine force.
[02:49:31.139 --> 02:49:32.380]  That's the Prozac that we need.
[02:49:32.380 --> 02:49:33.861]  Oh my God, I want more of it!
[02:49:33.861 --> 02:49:34.161]  Right.
[02:49:34.161 --> 02:49:38.004]  You get out in the sun and don't we all feel, Alex, don't we all feel better when we're out in the sun?
[02:49:38.004 --> 02:49:38.404]  Are you kidding?
[02:49:38.404 --> 02:49:40.606]  If I had my way, all I'd do is climb mountains.
[02:49:40.606 --> 02:49:48.832]  How do we let these, the medical model bamboozle us into thinking that the sun is this demon in the sky that's hell-bent on our destruction?
[02:49:48.832 --> 02:49:52.574]  You know, we've been bamboozled and entranced and we believe this nonsense.
[02:49:52.574 --> 02:49:56.117]  And then as you point out, when we don't have the vitamins and minerals, we do get sunburned.
[02:49:56.997 --> 02:49:58.038]  Well, that's another thing.
[02:49:58.038 --> 02:50:04.182]  If you want to prevent yourself from getting sunburned, make sure you're getting nutrients that get stored in your skin to protect you from the sun.
[02:50:04.182 --> 02:50:11.027]  Carotenes, flavonoids, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin E, they literally get deposited in your skin to protect you from the sun.
[02:50:11.027 --> 02:50:16.852]  And let me tell you something, skin cancer rates are increasing dramatically despite the fact that... Because we're not in the sun!
[02:50:17.612 --> 02:50:18.772]  How do you like that?
[02:50:18.772 --> 02:50:21.733]  The sun is actually protective against skin cancer!
[02:50:21.733 --> 02:50:29.315]  The sun is protective against skin cancer, and people are using sunscreens like they're going out of style, and skin cancer rates are increasing by 100%!
[02:50:29.315 --> 02:50:30.855]  Aluminum-based.
[02:50:30.855 --> 02:50:31.835]  Aluminum-based.
[02:50:31.835 --> 02:50:32.636]  We're going to come back.
[02:50:32.636 --> 02:50:40.737]  I want to talk about, again, somebody on these drugs, because I've got a schedule here from SSRStories.com, and it talks about warning.
[02:50:40.737 --> 02:50:42.318]  Going off this is a big deal.
[02:50:42.978 --> 02:50:46.162]  I mean, folks, you're on a LSD molecule.
[02:50:46.162 --> 02:50:47.584]  Okay?
[02:50:47.584 --> 02:50:49.907]  So we're going to come back, and we're extremists.
[02:50:49.907 --> 02:50:53.391]  We're saying LSD's bad to give to kids, especially.
[02:50:53.391 --> 02:50:55.734]  They're going to have a bad trip.
[02:50:55.734 --> 02:50:59.379]  And almost all these shooters and mothers that kill their kids, they're on it.
[02:50:59.379 --> 02:51:00.360]  Why don't we send them to jail?
[02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:05.783]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:51:05.783 --> 02:51:06.703]  Number 1.
[02:51:06.703 --> 02:51:10.126]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:51:10.126 --> 02:51:10.986]  Number 2.
[02:51:10.986 --> 02:51:15.889]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:51:15.889 --> 02:51:16.630]  It's true.
[02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:21.493]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:51:21.493 --> 02:51:22.333]  Number 3.
[02:51:22.333 --> 02:51:25.916]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:51:25.916 --> 02:51:29.598]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:51:29.818 --> 02:51:30.599]  Number 4.
[02:51:30.599 --> 02:51:33.381]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:51:33.381 --> 02:51:37.044]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:51:37.044 --> 02:51:37.844]  Number 5.
[02:51:37.844 --> 02:51:41.987]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:51:41.987 --> 02:51:46.751]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:51:47.031 --> 02:51:51.217]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:51:51.217 --> 02:51:53.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.263]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:51:55.263 --> 02:51:57.586]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:52:02.745 --> 02:52:14.276]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.
[02:52:14.276 --> 02:52:17.699]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[02:52:17.699 --> 02:52:21.142]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game.
[02:52:22.123 --> 02:52:23.425]  But it's not Africa.
[02:52:23.425 --> 02:52:24.986]  It's Argentina.
[02:52:24.986 --> 02:52:33.775]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, cougar, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America.
[02:52:33.775 --> 02:52:35.656]  All gold medal quality.
[02:52:35.656 --> 02:52:37.238]  All the action you can handle.
[02:52:38.740 --> 02:52:46.867]  Land Rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground transportation included, and more.
[02:52:46.867 --> 02:52:49.810]  All more affordable than you can imagine.
[02:52:49.810 --> 02:52:54.955]  The adventure of a lifetime starts at GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[02:52:54.955 --> 02:52:57.037]  The big game hunting ranch.
[02:52:57.037 --> 02:52:59.199]  GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[02:53:00.896 --> 02:53:04.078]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[02:53:04.078 --> 02:53:07.461]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[02:53:07.461 --> 02:53:10.303]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[02:53:10.303 --> 02:53:21.371]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[02:53:21.371 --> 02:53:22.512]  Then there's affordability.
[02:53:22.512 --> 02:53:27.095]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water.
[02:53:27.415 --> 02:53:28.116]  I think so.
[02:53:49.798 --> 02:53:55.043]  That's 877-99BERKEY or visit bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[02:53:55.043 --> 02:53:57.104]  Free shipping on every order over $50.
[02:53:57.104 --> 02:53:59.707]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[02:53:59.707 --> 02:54:10.676]  We don't need no education.
[02:54:10.676 --> 02:54:14.499]  We don't need no thought control.
[02:54:15.968 --> 02:54:18.009]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I don't have a dairy.
[02:54:18.009 --> 02:54:19.890]  I don't sell milk.
[02:54:19.890 --> 02:54:21.091]  I don't sell eggs.
[02:54:21.091 --> 02:54:22.892]  I don't sell beefsteak.
[02:54:22.892 --> 02:54:26.074]  There's a lot of contaminants in the beef and stuff now, as you know.
[02:54:26.074 --> 02:54:32.038]  There's some downsides to a bunch of meat, and even though I love every piece of it, because of the industrial system.
[02:54:32.838 --> 02:54:36.940]  We've got high-quality whey available, obviously, so I guess we do sell that in whey at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[02:54:36.940 --> 02:54:39.340]  It's a great place to get it and support the broadcast.
[02:54:39.340 --> 02:54:43.342]  Become a distributor by signing up with $10 and get discounts.

[02:54:49.404 --> 02:54:58.627]  And by the way, the root beer belly probiotic is one of the most amazing mixes of healthy bacteria that they've ever come out with.
[02:54:58.627 --> 02:55:00.467]  I'm using this myself.
[02:55:00.467 --> 02:55:01.267]  That's available.
[02:55:01.267 --> 02:55:02.048]  Tastes great.
[02:55:02.048 --> 02:55:03.048]  Kids love it.
[02:55:03.048 --> 02:55:04.308]  They can put it in water, stir it up.
[02:55:04.308 --> 02:55:05.729]  It tastes just like root beer.
[02:55:05.729 --> 02:55:08.449]  Well, I guess it is root beer without the sugar and stuff.
[02:55:08.449 --> 02:55:11.350]  It's all available at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[02:55:11.350 --> 02:55:14.011]  And also, if you're a radio listener and people complain, they go, hey man,
[02:55:14.571 --> 02:55:24.633]  You know, give us the phone number and so I will also give you that number 888-636-9277 for customer service.

[02:55:40.717 --> 02:55:41.037]  I think so.
[02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:13.409]  We're designed for the minerals, the trace elements, the things we need.
[02:56:13.409 --> 02:56:15.691]  The government says we need 40-something vitamins and minerals.
[02:56:15.691 --> 02:56:17.012]  We need 90.
[02:56:17.012 --> 02:56:20.195]  And it's all available at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[02:56:20.195 --> 02:56:25.160]  Okay, so continuing, basically you're saying, get out in the sunshine while you wean yourself off.
[02:56:25.580 --> 02:56:27.042]  There's different regimens online.
[02:56:27.042 --> 02:56:29.865]  Doctors say it takes about two months, generally, depending on the type.
[02:56:29.865 --> 02:56:32.748]  But obviously, consult one of the physicians.
[02:56:32.748 --> 02:56:38.394]  The problem is these psychologists aren't really physicians, and they'll tell you, stay on it, or their answer's more of it.
[02:56:38.394 --> 02:56:39.616]  Well, this isn't working.
[02:56:39.616 --> 02:56:40.357]  Well, stack them!
[02:56:40.697 --> 02:56:42.178]  You know, that'll fix it.
[02:56:42.178 --> 02:56:44.119]  So, we're not telling you what to do.
[02:56:44.119 --> 02:56:48.462]  I'm saying get out, exercise, fresh air, pray to God.
[02:56:48.462 --> 02:56:50.384]  If you don't believe in that, meditate.
[02:56:50.384 --> 02:56:51.925]  All the studies show it works.
[02:56:51.925 --> 02:56:53.446]  For whatever reason, praying helps.
[02:56:53.446 --> 02:56:55.768]  You know, there are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:56:55.768 --> 02:57:00.391]  Ben, what are some of the... I mean, why do the studies show, I've got them right here, that the praying helps?
[02:57:01.621 --> 02:57:03.963]  Well, relaxation response.
[02:57:03.963 --> 02:57:10.147]  You know, that's the reason why people have religion in the first place, is this idea that there's something that can help them, that can take control over their lives.
[02:57:10.147 --> 02:57:19.154]  You know, I'm not a particularly religious person, but I'm a very spiritual person, and there's a lot of good that can be had by understanding... Well, when you pray, what are you focusing on?
[02:57:19.154 --> 02:57:19.995]  The great void?
[02:57:19.995 --> 02:57:20.955]  The great unknown?
[02:57:20.955 --> 02:57:21.456]  The universe?
[02:57:21.456 --> 02:57:22.577]  You're forgetting all this.
[02:57:22.577 --> 02:57:22.757]  You're...
[02:57:23.237 --> 02:57:27.918]  The magic of the body, the amazingness of nature, the cosmos.
[02:57:27.918 --> 02:57:32.560]  There's a hundred trillion cells in your body and each one of them has 18 feet of DNA.
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:36.221]  If you added all the DNA in your body, it would go 300 billion miles.
[02:57:36.221 --> 02:57:42.503]  You have a coordinated, tightly choreographed system that is beyond belief just in a tiny cell.
[02:57:42.503 --> 02:57:43.323]  It's unbelievable.
[02:57:43.323 --> 02:57:44.123]  A hundred trillion.
[02:57:44.123 --> 02:57:45.624]  It's unbelievable, Alex!
[02:57:45.624 --> 02:57:47.104]  It's unbelievable!
[02:57:47.444 --> 02:57:49.365]  We're the most unbelievable creatures.
[02:57:49.365 --> 02:57:55.068]  We should be only focusing on that, let alone the cosmos that is trillions upon trillions.
[02:57:55.068 --> 02:57:55.348]  Exactly!
[02:57:55.348 --> 02:57:59.211]  I mean, look, one piece of human DNA, as you know, three billion long.
[02:57:59.211 --> 02:58:02.112]  Three billion long, one piece.
[02:58:02.112 --> 02:58:03.293]  We are incredible!
[02:58:03.553 --> 02:58:04.193]  Incredible.
[02:58:04.193 --> 02:58:05.314]  Alex, you know what a cell is?
[02:58:05.314 --> 02:58:09.036]  A cell is a tiny, we talk about cells so glibly, but what is this thing?
[02:58:09.036 --> 02:58:20.221]  It's a tiny little animal that if you took it out of your body and put it in a petri dish, it would walk to food, it would run away from poison, it excretes, it reproduces, it has a skeletal system, and it's 1-100 the size of a whole.
[02:58:20.221 --> 02:58:21.642]  No, no, we're just like jellyfish.
[02:58:21.642 --> 02:58:22.843]  We are a colony creature.
[02:58:24.448 --> 02:58:26.169]  You know about that, don't you?
[02:58:26.169 --> 02:58:27.730]  The fact that our tissues make up a colony.
[02:58:27.730 --> 02:58:28.591]  We are a colony.
[02:58:28.591 --> 02:58:29.011]  That's right.
[02:58:29.011 --> 02:58:30.613]  We're a hundred trillion cell colony.
[02:58:30.613 --> 02:58:31.633]  That's exactly right.
[02:58:31.633 --> 02:58:32.654]  Let alone the bacteria you've got.
[02:58:32.654 --> 02:58:35.596]  With DNA that resonates from signals from space.
[02:58:35.596 --> 02:58:36.537]  Proven.
[02:58:36.537 --> 02:58:37.218]  Antennas.
[02:58:37.218 --> 02:58:38.699]  Spiritual antennas.
[02:58:38.699 --> 02:58:42.642]  We'll be back.

[02:59:31.994 --> 02:59:33.955]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:59:33.955 --> 02:59:39.198]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:59:39.198 --> 02:59:42.340]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call
[02:59:42.620 --> 02:59:52.069]  800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:59:52.069 --> 02:59:53.610]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.610 --> 02:59:55.672]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.672 --> 02:59:58.875]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.885 --> 03:00:10.728]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.728 --> 03:00:12.309]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.309 --> 03:00:13.850]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.850 --> 03:00:18.053]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.053 --> 03:00:22.556]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.556 --> 03:00:28.440]  I promise you this, unless I get run over by a car, the next couple of weeks we'll get Ben back to take an hour or two of calls.
[03:00:29.501 --> 03:00:34.104]  On allergies, on getting off serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on weight loss, everything.
[03:00:34.104 --> 03:00:40.848]  And again, we're doing a few minutes of infomercialing here, but really, this is all, hey, go eat more eggs, folks, drink more milk, I mean, you know, healthy milk.
[03:00:40.848 --> 03:00:43.269]  It's just, it really, you know, more sunlight.
[03:00:43.269 --> 03:00:48.892]  It's, it's, now we do have Sleep Ease that does have the...
[03:00:50.413 --> 03:01:01.341]  Uh, chemicals, uh, the 5-HTP in it that then I guess gets converted over to the tryptophan and other things that the EPA took off the market with a fake scare a few decades ago.
[03:01:01.341 --> 03:01:06.665]  But the precursor of it, SleepEase, available at InfoWarsHealth.com right now.
[03:01:06.665 --> 03:01:08.446]  Uh, they're in the huge catalog.
[03:01:08.446 --> 03:01:11.228]  Uh, but, uh, Ben, you've agreed to stay another 20 minutes.
[03:01:11.228 --> 03:01:13.850]  What I'm gonna do is we're gonna come back in the next segment.
[03:01:13.850 --> 03:01:17.172]  I'm gonna throw it to you to cover areas of this in general.
[03:01:17.172 --> 03:01:18.793]  Then I'm gonna come back in the final segment.
[03:01:18.793 --> 03:01:19.594]  We're in overdrive.
[03:01:20.154 --> 03:01:35.520]  Right now this is just the reason I get so excited about all this is the truth is laying around all in front of us and it really makes me mad at the power structure because you're a nice guy you say well most doctors and people don't know this and that's actually true because I know a lot of doctors my dad does a lot of them but
[03:01:36.627 --> 03:01:39.209]  A lot of them in the power structure, they do know.
[03:01:39.209 --> 03:01:44.433]  And it's very cold-blooded that, you know, in double-blind studies, sugar pills are better than Prozac.
[03:01:44.433 --> 03:01:54.960]  I mean, what's happening in Harris and Kleibold and all these guys who are on these drugs when they go crazy and have that same million-mile stare, you know, crazy man look on their face?
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:01:56.121]  What's happening to them?
[03:01:57.352 --> 03:01:59.154]  Violence and paranoia are part of the hypervigilant response.
[03:01:59.154 --> 03:01:59.894]  Vigilance is important.
[03:02:13.407 --> 03:02:14.788]  You know, you gotta be aware.
[03:02:14.788 --> 03:02:17.890]  But this hypervigilant response is akin to paranoia.
[03:02:17.890 --> 03:02:20.651]  What we call paranoia can be defined as hypervigilance.
[03:02:20.651 --> 03:02:34.159]  When you start messing around with serotonin, pharmacologically manipulating its levels, keeping serotonin activity high artificially, you run the risk of this kind of paranoia hypervigilance, which is where rage comes from and rageful behavior comes from.
[03:02:34.159 --> 03:02:40.043]  You can't mess around with your brain chemistry artificially and not expect to create problems.
[03:02:40.563 --> 03:02:43.386]  And this whole idea of chemical imbalance, manipulating the brain.
[03:02:43.386 --> 03:02:45.187]  Alex, do you think there's a test for serotonin?
[03:02:45.187 --> 03:02:49.451]  Do you think you go to a psychiatrist and he does a test to see how high your serotonin levels are?
[03:02:49.451 --> 03:02:50.352]  No, they just put you on a clock.
[03:02:50.352 --> 03:02:51.033]  They just give them to you.
[03:02:51.033 --> 03:02:52.194]  They just give them to you.
[03:02:52.194 --> 03:02:52.914]  That's exactly right.
[03:02:52.914 --> 03:02:55.577]  They give them to you like they're M&M's or like they're candy.
[03:02:55.577 --> 03:02:58.760]  The fact of the matter is the history of psychiatry is not very pretty.
[03:02:58.760 --> 03:03:00.401]  The history of medicine in general is not very pretty.
[03:03:00.421 --> 03:03:12.369]  The inventor of the lobotomy, as you know, a hundred years ago, did thousands, thousands, where he would go before a carnival and take a mentally retarded person and jam an ice pick in their brain in front of people.
[03:03:12.369 --> 03:03:13.190]  That's how they do.
[03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:14.411]  That's how they used to cure depression.
[03:03:14.411 --> 03:03:19.074]  They would hack your brain out, or electroconvulsive therapy, where they shock you into being happy.
[03:03:19.074 --> 03:03:20.895]  This is the history of psychiatry.
[03:03:20.895 --> 03:03:23.877]  But Alex, the question is, is why are we complicit?
[03:03:23.877 --> 03:03:25.598]  Why do we participate?
[03:03:25.598 --> 03:03:27.780]  Why do we listen to anything they tell us?
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:33.983]  When, like you say, the information is right there in plain sight, perhaps hidden in plain sight, but it's in plain sight.
[03:03:33.983 --> 03:03:35.423]  I sent you a stack of information.
[03:03:35.423 --> 03:03:39.085]  It took me all of 15 or 20 minutes to gather that information.
[03:03:39.085 --> 03:03:40.145]  It's everywhere.
[03:03:40.145 --> 03:03:43.467]  The fact of the matter is, if you do your research, you will see.
[03:03:43.467 --> 03:03:47.828]  Serotonin is a sunlight, daylight, awareness, vigilance hormone.
[03:03:47.828 --> 03:03:50.129]  This is another very important point.
[03:03:50.129 --> 03:03:52.370]  Serotonin absorbs light.
[03:03:52.370 --> 03:03:53.371]  Serotonin contains
[03:03:54.031 --> 03:03:57.474]  Serotonin contains tryptophan, or a tryptophan-like shape.
[03:03:57.474 --> 03:03:59.195]  Tryptophan itself contains light.
[03:03:59.195 --> 03:04:04.719]  Chlorophyll, which is the ultimate light-absorbing substance, gets its light-absorbing power from tryptophan.
[03:04:04.719 --> 03:04:10.243]  So when you eat tryptophan, not only do you upregulate serotonin, but you help your body utilize light.
[03:04:10.763 --> 03:04:13.505]  Alex, we are photosynthetic beings.
[03:04:13.505 --> 03:04:15.766]  We absorb light from the sun.
[03:04:15.766 --> 03:04:22.550]  That sunlight gets turned into batteries, it gets turned into biochemistry, it gets turned into physical matter, most especially serotonin.
[03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:26.412]  In fact, by the way, tryptophan is a part of our visual pigment.
[03:04:26.412 --> 03:04:29.613]  We actually see via the activity of tryptophan.
[03:04:29.613 --> 03:04:33.155]  We receive light from the sun in our eyes via the activity of tryptophan.
[03:04:33.155 --> 03:04:33.996]  They're trying to block the tryptophan.
[03:04:33.996 --> 03:04:37.358]  By the way, I'm showing people images of public lobotomies.
[03:04:38.118 --> 03:04:51.115]  If you even misbehave, they just take you down and jam an ice pick up through the eyelid and right into your brain, into the cerebral cortex and just randomly jiggle it, punching holes into your brain with pleasure.
[03:04:51.115 --> 03:04:56.041]  We're going to come back and continue to break this down with pharmacist Ben Fuchs, InfoWarsHealth.com.
[03:05:01.483 --> 03:05:02.924]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.924 --> 03:05:13.568]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.568 --> 03:05:17.670]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:18.030 --> 03:05:20.773]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:20.773 --> 03:05:32.065]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.065 --> 03:05:35.229]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.529 --> 03:05:41.672]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.672 --> 03:05:51.577]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.577 --> 03:05:53.077]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.077 --> 03:05:54.978]  It's an info war.
[03:05:54.978 --> 03:05:57.799]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:03.430 --> 03:06:05.072]  Are you still a traditional smoker?
[03:06:21.730 --> 03:06:25.411]  All the benefits and satisfaction of smoking without the hazards.
[03:06:25.411 --> 03:06:31.513]  Choose your taste from a wide variety of our new American-made vape free at e-liquids at lasig.com.
[03:06:31.513 --> 03:06:37.775]  And Lasig smokes the competition by serving thousands of worldwide customers with real people customer service.
[03:06:37.775 --> 03:06:42.836]  Fast, free, same-day shipping and a 30-day warranty and satisfaction guarantee.
[03:06:42.836 --> 03:06:45.597]  So are you ready for a new vaping lifestyle?
[03:06:45.597 --> 03:06:46.057]  Then call 870-518-4307.
[03:06:46.057 --> 03:06:46.397]  That's 870-518-4307.
[03:06:51.559 --> 03:06:58.408]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older one gets.
[03:07:07.099 --> 03:07:16.686]  The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally, the older one gets, can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.
[03:07:16.686 --> 03:07:23.912]  If the Hunza men can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone in North America to experience a more youthful life as well.
[03:07:23.912 --> 03:07:26.714]  One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it,
[03:07:27.154 --> 03:07:29.515]  Is the type and quality of protein consumed.
[03:07:29.515 --> 03:07:32.915]  All protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged.
[03:07:32.915 --> 03:07:38.656]  Destroying 50-75% of your ability to utilize the body building amino acids.
[03:07:38.656 --> 03:07:44.298]  One World Way is not heat damaged and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids.
[03:07:44.298 --> 03:07:46.778]  This feat no one else has achieved.
[03:07:46.778 --> 03:07:49.519]  The results to your health can be amazing.
[03:07:49.519 --> 03:07:50.019]  Call 888-988-3325.
[03:07:50.019 --> 03:07:50.459]  That's 888-988-3325 or visit
[03:07:55.760 --> 03:07:57.202]  OneWorldWay.com.
[03:07:57.202 --> 03:08:01.306]  That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com.
[03:08:01.306 --> 03:08:06.731]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.731 --> 03:08:09.013]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:20.312 --> 03:08:21.252]  We're back live.
[03:08:21.252 --> 03:08:27.236]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, compounding pharmacist, is our guest.
[03:08:27.236 --> 03:08:32.959]  We're doing one more segment with him here on this Friday edition, then I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:08:32.959 --> 03:08:34.120]  Central, live in studio.
[03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:39.763]  We ran a Best Of with some new stuff that happened there, but also some tidbits of Best Of last Sunday, 4 to 6.
[03:08:39.763 --> 03:08:43.766]  About once a month it's rebroadcast, about three times a month it's live.
[03:08:44.566 --> 03:08:48.249]  One of the hardest working guys in media because I know there's no future if we don't turn this around.
[03:08:48.249 --> 03:08:52.533]  I'm going to go shoot a couple of reports that are going to be on the nightly news tonight of extreme import.
[03:08:52.533 --> 03:08:54.874]  And that's 7 o'clock central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:54.874 --> 03:08:57.557]  You can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month.
[03:08:57.557 --> 03:08:57.977]  Share them.
[03:08:57.977 --> 03:08:59.338]  I mean, nobody offers that.
[03:08:59.338 --> 03:09:00.799]  That just pays for the bandwidth.
[03:09:00.799 --> 03:09:02.260]  Our goal is to get the word out.
[03:09:03.081 --> 03:09:09.305]  We have the $115,000 contest we're able to do, because you're supporting us, for people to make films.
[03:09:09.305 --> 03:09:11.546]  A thousand films, I guess, will be made.
[03:09:11.546 --> 03:09:15.008]  It'll reach probably, I guess, 50 to 100 million people.
[03:09:15.008 --> 03:09:16.409]  That's my goal, is 100 million.
[03:09:16.409 --> 03:09:17.589]  I'd be happy with 50 million.
[03:09:17.589 --> 03:09:23.633]  There'll be some great films made, and great resistance to tyranny, and the winner gets $100,000, second place $10,000.
[03:09:23.633 --> 03:09:26.854]  It's Operation Paul Revere, third place $5,000, and then a shot
[03:09:27.955 --> 03:09:35.961]  That pool of not just the winners, but others to come here and be financed by InfoWars.com, producing it to make a flotilla of films.
[03:09:35.961 --> 03:09:43.806]  Because I can make some really good films, and I have, obviously, megaviral films, but we want to go to the next level and just expand the team in the face of this.
[03:09:43.806 --> 03:09:44.927]  It's all in.
[03:09:45.527 --> 03:09:50.329]  It's a total commitment against the New World Order, and we couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:09:50.329 --> 03:10:03.876]  And you support us in a win-win, buying ProPure water filters discounted with promo code WATER at InfoWarsStore.com, or going to InfoWarsHealth.com and getting the best supplements that we've assembled all in one spot via Longevity, discounted.
[03:10:03.876 --> 03:10:06.258]  InfoWarsHealth.com.
[03:10:06.258 --> 03:10:07.458]  This is how we do it.
[03:10:07.458 --> 03:10:13.821]  And by the way, I'm not being, you know, a bad guy here, because, I mean, against Genesis.
[03:10:13.821 --> 03:10:14.642]  Genesis is great.
[03:10:16.129 --> 03:10:18.530]  Most radio networks and stations take any advertising.
[03:10:18.530 --> 03:10:31.753]  Genesis has a lot of standards, but I'm approached all the time by supplement companies, and they'll say, we'll pay $100,000 to endorse this product, and I go see the claims, and I can't prove it, and I go, sorry, I'm not going to do that.
[03:10:31.753 --> 03:10:33.754]  And then they come back and go, we'll pay you $500,000.
[03:10:33.754 --> 03:10:36.395]  Right now.
[03:10:36.395 --> 03:10:38.855]  These are things you hear nationwide, not just on, you know, Genesis.
[03:10:38.855 --> 03:10:40.616]  And I go, I'm sorry, I just can't prove these things.
[03:10:42.312 --> 03:10:43.913]  Um, and so, no.
[03:10:43.913 --> 03:10:49.737]  So, I mean, I try to do money bombs, or sell memberships, or whatever, but everything I do is about getting the word out.
[03:10:49.737 --> 03:10:53.059]  If it's a t-shirt, it's about defending the Second Amendment, or property rights.
[03:10:53.059 --> 03:10:54.900]  If it's a film, it's about exposing Agenda 21.
[03:10:55.922 --> 03:10:57.984]  Everything we do is a win, win, win, win, win.
[03:10:57.984 --> 03:11:00.066]  And InfoWarsHealth is just amazing.
[03:11:00.066 --> 03:11:04.190]  So get your Beyond Tangy Tangerine, your Polymburst Plus that bears my name on it.
[03:11:04.190 --> 03:11:05.912]  I like it so much.
[03:11:05.912 --> 03:11:09.155]  All the different supplements are available there.
[03:11:09.155 --> 03:11:11.277]  The essential fatty acids, everything.
[03:11:11.277 --> 03:11:13.079]  InfoWarsHealth.com.
[03:11:13.079 --> 03:11:14.120]  I know you're supporting us.
[03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:19.385]  Now, Ben, I'm going to give you the rest of this segment, about 10 minutes, to get into other facets.
[03:11:20.126 --> 03:11:32.159]  What you would do, why allergies are increasing, how people should detox, other things about what Prozac and other drugs are doing to people, what you would do with a child who's obviously, you know, bouncing off the walls.
[03:11:32.159 --> 03:11:34.642]  It's usually they admit what they've been eating.
[03:11:34.642 --> 03:11:37.405]  You've got the floor for the balance of this segment.
[03:11:38.283 --> 03:11:40.466]  Alex, there's two great movements in the body.
[03:11:40.466 --> 03:11:47.636]  You have the movement towards stress and vigilance and awareness and fear and you have the relaxation response.
[03:11:47.636 --> 03:11:54.586]  Growth and repair and anti-aging and healing all occur when the body is relaxed.
[03:11:55.066 --> 03:12:09.772]  Anything that exacerbates or exaggerates the stress response, serotonin for example, prescription drugs for example, sugar and processed food for example, anything that exacerbates the stress response, this fear response, is going to shut down growth and repair.
[03:12:09.772 --> 03:12:16.254]  And this is why it seems to me like there's this, almost this insidious conspiracy to keep us from being able to grow, to keep
[03:12:16.254 --> 03:12:39.885]  To keep us sick, to keep us from being able to repair, to accelerate the aging process, and this is why it's so, so, so important to avoid interacting with prescription drugs at all times, with the exception perhaps of pain pills if you're in pain, antibiotics obviously, although these days we hear about the problems with antibiotic resistance, which anybody who understands anything about antibiotics could have seen this one coming.
[03:12:40.745 --> 03:12:42.807]  But still, there's times when you need antibiotics, perhaps.
[03:12:42.807 --> 03:12:49.714]  Aside from antibiotics and pain pills and perhaps chemotherapy, any prescription drugs need to be avoided like the plague.
[03:12:49.714 --> 03:12:51.215]  Literally like the plague.
[03:12:51.215 --> 03:12:56.980]  If you're on an SSRI drug, if you're considering an SSRI drug, please consider the alternatives.
[03:12:56.980 --> 03:12:59.943]  Number one, get yourself out in the sun.
[03:12:59.943 --> 03:13:02.866]  Number two, make sure you're practicing deep breathing techniques.
[03:13:03.166 --> 03:13:06.428]  Number three, make sure you're getting enough salt for your adrenal glands.
[03:13:06.428 --> 03:13:09.989]  This is another hideous idea that we have to avoid salt.
[03:13:09.989 --> 03:13:19.094]  The fact of the matter is, salt is very important for helping the adrenal glands and keeping your body from going into this fight-or-flight response.
[03:13:19.594 --> 03:13:30.119]  Make sure that you're using a nutritional supplement program, especially the B-Complex, which is not only important for making serotonin, but it's important for the stress response and it's important for mental health as well.
[03:13:30.119 --> 03:13:33.600]  Make sure you're focusing on digestive wellness.
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:37.322]  The immune system is the digestive system in many ways.
[03:13:37.322 --> 03:13:41.584]  In fact, 80 to 90 percent of your immune system is located in the digestive tract.
[03:13:41.584 --> 03:13:48.767]  You talk about allergies, the number one cause of allergies, whether it's to cedarwood or whether it's to juniper or whether it's to pollen or whether it's to
[03:13:49.227 --> 03:13:49.887]  Anything else?
[03:13:49.887 --> 03:13:55.889]  The number one cause is a stressed out immune system, especially considering the kind of foods that we're eating.
[03:13:55.889 --> 03:14:03.092]  If you're dealing with H. pylori bacteria, this is one of the main reasons why the body goes into a stress response.
[03:14:03.092 --> 03:14:04.953]  Address your H. pylori.
[03:14:04.953 --> 03:14:06.513]  That means get on probiotics.
[03:14:06.513 --> 03:14:08.374]  That means eat fermented foods.
[03:14:08.374 --> 03:14:10.755]  That means make sure that you're staying away from anything that
[03:14:11.115 --> 03:14:11.315]  I think?
[03:14:35.892 --> 03:14:39.194]  80 million Americans are dealing with fatty liver disease.
[03:14:39.194 --> 03:14:43.536]  If you go to a doctor today, he'll tell you, oh, it's just a normal part of aging.
[03:14:43.536 --> 03:14:45.236]  No, it's not a normal part of aging.
[03:14:45.236 --> 03:14:54.941]  In fact, they call it non-alcoholic fatty liver disease because they have to distinguish it from the kind of fatty liver disease that you used to have to drink a pint of Jack Daniels to get.
[03:14:54.941 --> 03:14:57.362]  Today, a pint of Jack Daniels every day to get.
[03:14:57.362 --> 03:14:59.503]  Today, we're all getting that kind of disease.
[03:15:00.203 --> 03:15:03.884]  Focus on liver wellness by eliminating processed foods.
[03:15:03.884 --> 03:15:07.566]  Make sure you're eating less calories and you're getting more nutrients.
[03:15:07.566 --> 03:15:12.588]  And this is one of the major reasons why a nutritional supplement program is so important.
[03:15:12.588 --> 03:15:16.969]  Use liquid nutrients and use liquid foods as much as possible.
[03:15:16.969 --> 03:15:20.291]  It will remove the load off of your digestive tract.
[03:15:20.291 --> 03:15:22.852]  Give yourself a food holiday periodically.
[03:15:22.852 --> 03:15:24.632]  Practice intermittent fasting.
[03:15:24.632 --> 03:15:26.153]  In fact, one of the most anabolic
[03:15:26.673 --> 03:15:27.073]  Do you want
[03:15:45.640 --> 03:15:46.941]  It's a healing system.
[03:15:46.941 --> 03:15:48.602]  It's a regenerating system.
[03:15:48.602 --> 03:15:52.984]  You are witness to this healing and regenerating system every time you cut yourself.
[03:15:52.984 --> 03:15:54.885]  You can see how the skin heals.
[03:15:54.885 --> 03:16:04.871]  Well, that same healing system that takes place in the skin, takes place in the bones, takes place in the digestive tract, takes place in the nervous system, takes place in the liver and throughout the body.
[03:16:04.871 --> 03:16:08.333]  Access this healing response that is your birthright.
[03:16:08.333 --> 03:16:12.276]  Nobody has to have a degenerative disease.
[03:16:12.276 --> 03:16:14.257]  In fact, we know that there's a hundred
[03:16:14.757 --> 03:16:14.978]  I'm good.
[03:16:31.277 --> 03:16:32.577]  We have to participate.
[03:16:32.577 --> 03:16:37.238]  We have to take a role in our health, and that means not listening to the medical model.
[03:16:37.238 --> 03:16:43.180]  We have more doctors in this country per capita than any other country in the world, than any other country in the history of the world.
[03:16:43.180 --> 03:16:50.081]  We spend more money per capita on health, yet we are the sickest culture ever in the history of mankind.
[03:16:50.081 --> 03:16:53.442]  Clearly, the modern medical model has failed us.
[03:16:54.362 --> 03:17:00.523]  Ambulatory medicine, not heroic medicine where you get stitched up after you get hit by a car, but ambulatory medicine.
[03:17:00.523 --> 03:17:11.046]  This idea that you can go to the doctor for your blood pressure, you can go to the doctor for your depression, you can go to the doctor for whatever kind of illness you have, ambulatory medicine is not the answer.
[03:17:11.046 --> 03:17:20.548]  We are the answer, the divine force is the answer, and it works through simple things like deep breathing, simple things like getting out in the sun, simple things like eating whole food.
[03:17:20.928 --> 03:17:26.174]  Simple things like getting on a nutritional supplement program and simple things like spirituality and praying as well.
[03:17:26.174 --> 03:17:34.844]  And truly health is a multi-dimensional process that works spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically.
[03:17:34.844 --> 03:17:35.725]  All the dimensions
[03:17:35.725 --> 03:17:36.106]  I'm good.
[03:17:52.868 --> 03:17:53.409]  Thank you so much.
[03:18:10.203 --> 03:18:12.183]  Stress is not a four-letter word.
[03:18:12.183 --> 03:18:16.364]  Small amounts of stress actually turn on this building process.
[03:18:16.364 --> 03:18:22.905]  The body likes small amounts of stress and long, luscious, long periods of rest.
[03:18:22.905 --> 03:18:31.947]  And this combination of stress and rest with appropriate nutrition and nutritional strategies, along with mental and emotional strategies, is the key to wellness and the key to health.
[03:18:31.947 --> 03:18:35.927]  And nobody, nobody, nobody has to deal with degenerative disease.
[03:18:35.927 --> 03:18:38.708]  They're all reversible, including cancer, FYI.
[03:18:40.487 --> 03:18:41.749]  Amazing information.
[03:18:41.749 --> 03:18:47.355]  In fact, let's do one more segment and come back with this longevity news that I've got.
[03:18:47.355 --> 03:18:47.915]  Here it is.
[03:18:47.915 --> 03:18:50.838]  This is out of Yahoo Finance.
[03:18:50.838 --> 03:18:59.688]  AL International announces results of longevity clinical research studies performed by Clemson University Institute of Neuromedical Research.
[03:18:59.688 --> 03:19:00.309]  Have you seen this?
[03:19:00.951 --> 03:19:03.573]  I love it, Alex.
[03:19:03.573 --> 03:19:05.654]  Medical professionals, they need to see paperwork.
[03:19:05.654 --> 03:19:06.154]  Fine.
[03:19:06.154 --> 03:19:07.195]  There's the paperwork.
[03:19:07.195 --> 03:19:08.675]  I've been seeing it for 20 years.
[03:19:08.675 --> 03:19:10.176]  The paperwork I get is letters.
[03:19:10.176 --> 03:19:11.457]  That's my paperwork.
[03:19:11.457 --> 03:19:13.838]  Letters from people who tried to be on Tangy Tangerine.
[03:19:13.838 --> 03:19:16.220]  So now, there's credentialed letters.
[03:19:16.220 --> 03:19:20.242]  There's credentialed information from Clemson University, and I love it.
[03:19:20.242 --> 03:19:21.703]  And that's some powerful stuff, Alex.
[03:19:22.083 --> 03:19:25.566]  And they're the best, and that's what we carry at Infowarshealth.com.
[03:19:25.566 --> 03:19:31.871]  And you support the broadcast so we can launch Operation Paul Revere.
[03:19:31.871 --> 03:19:37.176]  $115,000 in cash prizes, $100,000 first place.

[03:19:54.029 --> 03:19:58.692]  Whether it's the gun grabbing, all of it, you make the film, I'll judge it, you'll win.
[03:19:58.692 --> 03:19:59.412]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:59.412 --> 03:20:01.534]  People will wake up, that's the key.
[03:20:01.534 --> 03:20:02.955]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.955 --> 03:20:13.621]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:20:13.621 --> 03:20:17.704]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.

[03:20:35.580 --> 03:20:41.723]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:20:41.723 --> 03:20:51.628]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:20:51.628 --> 03:20:53.108]  The war is here.
[03:20:53.108 --> 03:20:55.009]  It's an info war.
[03:20:55.009 --> 03:20:56.770]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:21:03.430 --> 03:21:05.512]  Are you still a traditional smoker?
[03:21:05.512 --> 03:21:10.656]  Now experience a new lifestyle and try vaping with e-cigarettes by Lecig.

[03:22:31.853 --> 03:22:36.416]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:22:36.416 --> 03:22:42.220]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:22:42.220 --> 03:22:45.862]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:22:45.862 --> 03:22:48.584]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[03:23:00.652 --> 03:23:04.656]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[03:23:04.656 --> 03:23:12.163]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[03:23:12.163 --> 03:23:14.866]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[03:23:14.866 --> 03:23:21.472]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[03:23:21.472 --> 03:23:22.593]  After Hurricane Sandy,

[03:23:31.903 --> 03:23:35.868]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[03:23:35.868 --> 03:23:37.730]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.
[03:23:37.930 --> 03:23:40.231]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[03:24:42.877 --> 03:24:47.701]  Now the Communist Party USA says they want to turn our guts in.
[03:24:47.701 --> 03:24:49.983]  You know they're not going to be turning theirs in.
[03:24:49.983 --> 03:24:51.965]  No, no, they keep theirs.
[03:24:51.965 --> 03:24:53.146]  You turn yours in.
[03:24:53.146 --> 03:24:56.969]  They're real nice people.
[03:24:56.969 --> 03:24:58.551]  Oh boy, it doesn't matter.
[03:24:58.551 --> 03:25:03.895]  Communists have killed what, about seven, eight times worldwide what Hitler did?
[03:25:03.895 --> 03:25:04.376]  Wow, look at that.
[03:25:04.376 --> 03:25:08.199]  We ought to put their official logo in that article we've got linked on Drudge at the top.
[03:25:08.199 --> 03:25:09.020]  That one that says CPUSA.
[03:25:11.502 --> 03:25:15.544]  And maybe we should slap that right up there at the top of that article because it really says it all.
[03:25:15.544 --> 03:25:16.825]  And hey, they're working with Obama.
[03:25:16.825 --> 03:25:19.006]  There he is right there.
[03:25:19.006 --> 03:25:20.907]  Oh, we're in a lot of trouble right now.
[03:25:20.907 --> 03:25:23.389]  Oh, this is a good image right here.
[03:25:23.389 --> 03:25:24.770]  That actually ought to be added right there.
[03:25:24.770 --> 03:25:25.710]  That's the one right there.
[03:25:25.710 --> 03:25:29.212]  I'm going to have that added to the article.
[03:25:29.212 --> 03:25:33.595]  In closing, pharmacist Ben Fuchs is here with us and his information.
[03:25:34.540 --> 03:25:38.804]  He's just amazing and he looks 20 years younger than he actually is.

[03:25:40.765 --> 03:25:44.308]  I'm going to get this press release added up there to that site.
[03:25:44.308 --> 03:25:46.170]  I'm also going to get it added to InfoWars.com.
[03:25:46.170 --> 03:25:57.079]  Briefly tell us about the announcement by the clinical research studies performed by Clemson University and what they found about Beyond Tangy Tangerine and some of the other products at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[03:25:58.035 --> 03:25:58.916]  Let me tell you something, Alex.
[03:25:58.916 --> 03:26:04.442]  People always want to know one thing that they could do just to see how well this stuff works.
[03:26:04.442 --> 03:26:10.269]  I'm telling you, if you try the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, there's no way you will not become a believer in nutrition.
[03:26:10.269 --> 03:26:15.735]  It's because of this unbelievable concentration of nutrients in a liquid format.
[03:26:15.735 --> 03:26:17.016]  The digestive system
[03:26:17.597 --> 03:26:37.444]  The system that's designed by nature to absorb nutrients over time becomes so overwhelmed that no matter what we're eating, no matter what we're taking, especially in terms of nutritional supplements that come in pills and nutritional value of foods, we don't get the benefit of these things because our digestive system starts to break down.
[03:26:37.444 --> 03:26:43.566]  When you get your nutrients in a liquid format, whether you're talking about soups or smoothies
[03:26:43.626 --> 03:26:46.507]  You're getting that chemical that's so key that's in the meat.
[03:27:12.175 --> 03:27:16.779]  I'm not sure which one that is, but you're getting lots of great protein in the meat, and you're getting it in a liquid format.
[03:27:16.779 --> 03:27:17.980]  You know the one that's in turkey?
[03:27:17.980 --> 03:27:18.901]  It keeps escaping you.
[03:27:18.901 --> 03:27:20.902]  You're talking about tryptophan.
[03:27:20.902 --> 03:27:22.744]  That's the famous tryptophan that we're talking about.
[03:27:22.744 --> 03:27:28.168]  And that's why they talk about tryptophan as being a sleepy kind of substance, because it's so relaxing.
[03:27:28.168 --> 03:27:32.552]  That's another story, but the fact is... Yeah, see how that's the real Prozac right there.
[03:27:33.172 --> 03:27:35.093]  That's your natural Prozac.
[03:27:35.093 --> 03:27:36.194]  5-HTP and tryptophan.
[03:27:36.194 --> 03:27:38.595]  Now that you're sleepy, you've finally gotten relaxed.
[03:27:38.595 --> 03:27:40.135]  You're relaxed, exactly.
[03:27:40.135 --> 03:27:40.956]  That's exactly right.
[03:27:40.956 --> 03:27:43.177]  Now, back to your question about this Clemson study.
[03:27:43.177 --> 03:27:48.580]  What they found was exactly what I've been saying for years, since I started using the Young Javiti products back in the late 90s.
[03:27:49.500 --> 03:27:50.120]  We're good to go!
[03:28:06.510 --> 03:28:07.150]  I think so.
[03:28:32.222 --> 03:28:33.884]  Thank you for all you do.
[03:28:33.884 --> 03:28:34.244]  Thank you.
[03:28:34.244 --> 03:28:34.825]  My pleasure, Alex.
[03:28:56.457 --> 03:28:59.340]  Alright folks, that's it for the live segment of the transmission.
[03:28:59.340 --> 03:29:01.341]  The in-studio interview with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[03:29:01.341 --> 03:29:02.943]  Halfway in the first hour is coming up.
[03:29:02.943 --> 03:29:05.865]  You're going to be stationed, tuned in, and saying, I don't understand.
[03:29:05.865 --> 03:29:09.468]  Some days were four hours, some days were three hours, some days were three and a half hours.
[03:29:09.468 --> 03:29:11.330]  We send out four hours.
[03:29:11.330 --> 03:29:16.915]  And for, I don't know, 15 years or so, 14 years I did three hours, and for a couple years I did...
[03:29:18.109 --> 03:29:19.210]  I did four hours.
[03:29:19.210 --> 03:29:22.072]  But with the nightly news and the stuff, it just sometimes burned me out too bad.
[03:29:22.072 --> 03:29:28.516]  But now that I'm back, I've gotten on vitamins and minerals, I have more energy, so I'm kind of leaning towards four hours just officially again.
[03:29:28.516 --> 03:29:29.937]  But InfoWarsHealth.com.

[03:29:46.647 --> 03:29:47.987]  It is a revolution.
[03:29:47.987 --> 03:29:49.108]  Information is power.
[03:29:49.108 --> 03:29:50.749]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:29:50.749 --> 03:29:52.049]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.049 --> 03:29:54.570]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.570 --> 03:29:56.571]  Alex Jones at the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:56.571 --> 03:29:58.092]  See you this Sunday, 4 to 6 Live Central.
