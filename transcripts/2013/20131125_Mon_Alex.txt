[00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.011]  Coast to coast.
[00:00:03.372 --> 00:00:04.693]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:08.636]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:18.826]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.487 --> 00:00:20.287]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:21.969]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.213]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:30.877]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:49.596]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:53.416]  It is Monday, the 25th day.
[00:00:54.297 --> 00:00:58.878]  Already the 25th day of November 2013.
[00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:05.439]  And we have an absolutely jam-packed radio broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:13.301]  Obviously, we've been tracking this at Infowars.com in the last week since Israel and their good buddy, Iran,
[00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:40.798]  came out and, excuse me, Freudian Slip, their good buddy Saudi Arabia, came out and said that if they don't like the peace deal that is struck in Paris, which was completed Saturday, between Iran and the West, that they're going to seriously look at attacking that country, and that Saudi Arabia has already bought and purchased and is transferring, which means they were there years ago.
[00:01:42.344 --> 00:01:47.650]  The weapons, nuclear weapons from Pakistan, so they can nuke Iran.
[00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:03.147]  And I just marvel at how good my sources are, because as you know, I've been on record saying that Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons from the one-stop shop in the Middle East, Central Asia, Pakistan.
[00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:16.204]  And that Pakistan is where they reportedly got the material, but then were given the technology to cause chain reaction from the Russkies.
[00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:33.497]  And I was told that by a very high-level military source and another high-level military source, and I was talking to a special warfare source that had been in a lot of really secretive operations, and they got very, very upset.
[00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:35.291]  When I raised that.
[00:02:36.232 --> 00:02:39.493]  And said, I don't know how you know this, but yes, Iran has the bomb.
[00:02:39.913 --> 00:02:43.394]  And stopped talking to me about stuff like this.
[00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:46.515]  And was basically like, it's dangerous that you know that.
[00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:51.897]  And so, I'm not bragging that I know this type of stuff.
[00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:55.519]  I don't like always having such accurate information.
[00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.560]  But it is what it is.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.921]  So, that's why no one said Iran.
[00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.019]  But no one wants to say they have nukes, just like Israel doesn't want to say they have nukes.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.050]  Or then that gives other countries the excuse to proliferate and have nuclear weapons as well.
[00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:16.108]  Israel has reportedly 800, according to Jane's Weapons Quarterly last time I looked.
[00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.250]  Mainline media here says 200.
[00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.315]  British News says over 400.
[00:03:22.996 --> 00:03:24.277]  But Jane's is based in England.
[00:03:24.297 --> 00:03:25.359]  They're usually the most accurate.
[00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.720]  They say upwards of 800.
[00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:28.142]  That was a few years ago.
[00:03:28.763 --> 00:03:31.726]  I had to get into their subscription system to even get that information.
[00:03:32.824 --> 00:03:38.927]  You either have to buy the big quarterly book or contact him online to get information because most of the stuff is not public knowledge.
[00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.188]  A lot of it's seen as semi-classified.
[00:03:42.168 --> 00:03:48.651]  But I guess if the moon is not made of cheese as classified as well, that is all coming up.
[00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:53.293]  And yeah, there's the World Net Daily article, Russia helping Iran accelerate nuke program with their centrifuges.
[00:03:55.598 --> 00:03:56.379]  That's separate.
[00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:58.020]  That was back in January, that report.
[00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:03.625]  The centrifuges need to be up to 90% to really make a good bomb.
[00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:04.786]  They were up to 20%.
[00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:08.729]  And now this new deal says 5%.
[00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.191]  And if Iran actually follows the deal,
[00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:16.179]  And if the UN doesn't shut them up like they did Iraq, this is a good deal.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.641]  The problem is the globalists are treacherous.
[00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:21.504]  And they're going to try to claim Iran breaks the deal.
[00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:23.045]  You're like, well, are you for Iran?
[00:04:23.445 --> 00:04:26.127]  No, I'm for peace and not having a nuclear war.
[00:04:26.508 --> 00:04:34.094]  That's why the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, a couple months ago, went on Friday night and told Obama on that Saturday, we're not going to strike.
[00:04:34.134 --> 00:04:34.754]  You can't do it.
[00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:35.435]  Nuclear war.
[00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.196]  Top generals are threatening to resign.
[00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:41.818]  And Obama didn't want to let him resign over that, so he later just went after him for other issues.
[00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:43.078]  There's been a purge.
[00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:46.480]  And I'm not romanticizing the U.S.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.821]  General Staff, but they're not suicidal.
[00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:51.621]  They like to fight wars they can win.
[00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:53.242]  It's real simple.
[00:04:53.902 --> 00:05:06.806]  And the Iranians are crazy enough, folks, to launch their atomic weapons at Israel and others, and then Israel's going to bomb all of Iran, the Russians are going to respond, the Chinese, the Indians, the Pakistanis.
[00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:07.706]  It's World War III.
[00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:15.563]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:05:15.923 --> 00:05:24.405]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:32.128]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:40.030]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.933]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:05:44.493 --> 00:05:48.136]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:55.282]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.

[00:06:03.048 --> 00:06:07.091]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:15.088]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:06:15.288 --> 00:06:22.511]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:06:22.691 --> 00:06:25.873]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:27.814]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:32.638]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:06:32.718 --> 00:06:35.480]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.404]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:45.066]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:06:45.266 --> 00:06:50.310]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.492]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:53.732 --> 00:06:59.600]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.723]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[00:07:01.883 --> 00:07:06.690]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:19.597]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:07:19.737 --> 00:07:25.718]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.

[00:08:05.978 --> 00:08:06.758]  You want answers?
[00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:07.618]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:21.667]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:50.171]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:52.652]  Another worldwide transmission.
[00:08:53.253 --> 00:08:56.635]  The 25th of November, 2013.
[00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:58.837]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:58.857 --> 00:09:00.218]  I want to make a little announcement here.
[00:09:00.858 --> 00:09:05.262]  I will undoubtedly be calling in and Skyping in...
[00:09:06.874 --> 00:09:08.795]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:16.480]  We're running a rebroadcast Friday, but I have absolutely sworn up and down to take my children hiking and camping, and I never take off.
[00:09:17.021 --> 00:09:22.844]  Even when I take off, I'm working constantly, so I am going to take off the next four days.
[00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:35.453]  But David Knight, who has proven to be a great co-host and fill-in host and host of InfoWars Nightly News, he will be here with most of our reporters on the Nightly News and, of course, doing the radio show.
[00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:46.465]  on Tuesday and Wednesday and if he wants to he can do Thursday as well but certainly a lot of breaking news and I'll be calling in on the show.
[00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:53.773]  Wild horses obviously cannot and will not drag me away but I am going to take my children camping
[00:09:54.854 --> 00:10:18.969]  As promised, and I was going to go to Colorado and also kill two birds with one stone a few weeks ago and go on George Norris' TV show, pre-taped two episodes of that, but I had a lot of family and Infowars operation stuff pop up, crop up at the very same time, so I had to cancel that Colorado camping trip, so I'm going to take off a few days and do a mini-trip outside Austin.
[00:10:20.376 --> 00:10:22.797]  Or who knows, we may go out to a family ranch in East Texas or something.
[00:10:23.198 --> 00:10:25.419]  I'm not sure yet, but my children are hopping up and down.
[00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:29.601]  I'm absolutely ready to go do that and come back on Friday and have Thanksgiving with my parents.
[00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.963]  But I hope you all have a great Thanksgiving coming up as well.
[00:10:33.564 --> 00:10:35.585]  There's obviously a lot of big world news breaking.
[00:10:35.605 --> 00:10:36.385]  We're going to cover it all.
[00:10:37.266 --> 00:10:39.327]  We have the reports right here.
[00:10:41.937 --> 00:10:47.219]  Iran nuclear deal, Saudi Arabia warns it will strike on its own even without Israel.
[00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:55.722]  London Telegraph and Braggs, they've secured nuclear weapons from Pakistan.
[00:10:56.943 --> 00:11:01.284]  And of course that's not going to go too well because you just watch if this happens.
[00:11:01.905 --> 00:11:08.107]  The reason the Joint Chiefs have not allowed, and they're not in command, they've just threatened to quit.
[00:11:09.745 --> 00:11:30.923]  If Obama tries to launch an attack on Iran, because the word is, right around the time the last year of Bush's administration, six and a half, seven years ago, they were completing atomic weapons and warheads, and then have now completed being able to put them on top of medium-range missiles.
[00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:39.795]  That can hit Israel, obviously, and you want to gamble that the Iron Dome weapon anti-missile system will be able to stop them?
[00:11:39.835 --> 00:11:41.415]  Probably won't be able to stop them.
[00:11:42.096 --> 00:11:43.536]  So I'm going to just keep announcing that.
[00:11:43.576 --> 00:11:46.097]  You only hear it here, and if you don't believe me, that's fine.
[00:11:46.897 --> 00:11:48.938]  I told you Saudi Arabia had nuclear weapons.
[00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:51.479]  I mean, South Africa had them, and it came out later.
[00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:53.800]  There's many more countries have them.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.881]  And, of course, India and Pakistan are the big issue.
[00:11:57.481 --> 00:12:00.242]  If a nuclear war starts, it's probably going to be there.
[00:12:00.822 --> 00:12:02.023]  That's what most analysts say.
[00:12:02.043 --> 00:12:09.166]  They've had a couple wars with each other over the disputed Kazmir region, and they absolutely hate each other.
[00:12:09.906 --> 00:12:13.568]  You see, folks, people think the Muslims hate America, and on average they don't.
[00:12:13.588 --> 00:12:20.952]  They want to move here and be in a freer culture, but while still keeping their non-radical Muslim values.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.521]  And many of them are great people.
[00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:37.729]  But you do have the radical Islam that the globalists have been funding, supporting, and putting in charge, because they don't want truly progressive, I don't mean globalist, New World Order, socialist progressive, but truly progressive societies in the Middle East.
[00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:46.714]  They want backwards controlled areas run by basically Bedouins that British intelligence hired in 1903 that pretty much run the whole region now.
[00:12:48.054 --> 00:12:50.076]  And that's what the House of Saad is, and
[00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:54.021]  The Muslims hate each other more than anybody else.
[00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:57.004]  And the Indians and Pakistanis hate each other.
[00:12:58.346 --> 00:12:59.507]  The Hindus and the Muslims.
[00:12:59.908 --> 00:13:06.915]  There's a lot of groups in India, but it's the Hindus and the Muslims that are really... You study the cultural battles, that's the big issue.
[00:13:07.376 --> 00:13:08.457]  That's how it is in Africa.
[00:13:08.637 --> 00:13:12.061]  One African tribe will hate the other African tribe right across the river.
[00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:17.546]  The Animas will hate the Christians, the Christians will hate the Muslims, the Muslims will hate the Christians.
[00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:21.809]  And people will find a reason to go rob and kill somebody.
[00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:32.075]  So we call it racism and people nowadays think the only form of discrimination or abuse is racism.
[00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:35.157]  Racism is just a modern term for tribalism
[00:13:36.804 --> 00:13:39.406]  Between different ethnic groups.
[00:13:40.026 --> 00:13:51.794]  But historically, it'd be groups of Romans before they unified what is Italy today, killing each other in hundreds of years of war, before the city of Rome ended up first conquering what is Italy.
[00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:56.458]  Before that, it was known as just the land of the Romans.
[00:13:56.478 --> 00:13:59.620]  It hadn't been known as Italy until the last thousand years or so.
[00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:05.098]  And, you know, those guys over the hill, they're bad, we're gonna kill them.
[00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:07.641]  Exact same genetic group, and that's what's so frustrating.
[00:14:07.922 --> 00:14:10.345]  We've been colonized by foreign offshore megabanks.
[00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:16.959]  Who are literally waging war against the human condition and trying to dumb us down in Europe and the U.S.
[00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:24.463]  and in Australia, teaching in globalist standardized tests that 2 plus 2 equals 5, 5 plus 5 equals 12, literally.
[00:14:25.363 --> 00:14:28.285]  Brown bags and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist.
[00:14:28.585 --> 00:14:39.151]  So you're all just seeing all this stuff to fight about everywhere and obsessed with what color you are or what religion, instead of all of us going under a scientific, dumbing down takeover.
[00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:49.193]  So you say, well, that's ridiculous saying peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist and, you know, don't ask for them on the school menu because it hurts Hispanic children's feelings.
[00:14:49.533 --> 00:14:53.854]  That's meant to get the Hispanics going, yeah, I am offended by a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:58.075]  So we're all fighting with each other when we would all just really be getting along.
[00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:06.678]  It was Christians and good people who came together to end the last 500 years of ethnic slavery.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:15.665]  Because 500 years ago, there were big struggles by, in Europe predominantly, whites who did not want to be slaves anymore to other whites.
[00:15:16.225 --> 00:15:17.206]  They called it feudalism.
[00:15:17.546 --> 00:15:22.289]  So as feudalism fell out in the last 500 years, they said, okay, well, we've got to turn somewhere else.
[00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:36.038]  We'll just literally send our ships to the western coast of Africa, grab people, and take them to slave plantations all over the Caribbean to produce sugar cane to make rum to ship back to Europe.
[00:15:36.678 --> 00:15:40.001]  And there were big fights and cities burned down in Europe.
[00:15:41.643 --> 00:15:45.346]  If you go back 500, 400, 300 years ago, over-ending slavery.
[00:15:45.526 --> 00:15:49.810]  It wasn't like it was some debate that just started with the North versus the South.
[00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:58.718]  There were, look it up, there were anti-slavery riots burning major cities in Europe over the African slave trade, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:59.438 --> 00:16:01.961]  Because they had just gone through it there.
[00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:11.907]  They estimate that millions of Christians died in different religious wars, with Catholics killing Protestants and Protestants killing Catholics.
[00:16:11.927 --> 00:16:19.413]  It just went on and on and on, and wars in the Netherlands, and five or six giant wars in England, and huge wars in France.
[00:16:19.453 --> 00:16:23.116]  See, there's all this real history, and I'm not lessening slavery here.
[00:16:23.196 --> 00:16:23.776]  It's terrible.
[00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:24.497]  The point is...
[00:16:25.197 --> 00:16:29.040]  It's like it's the only human experience they teach, when it's perpetual!
[00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.042]  It's the same story over and over again!
[00:16:31.062 --> 00:16:44.354]  And now we're going into slavery to the New World Order, they're poisoning our food, poisoning our water, destroying our dollar, going after our families, de-industrializing us, and teaching people the oppression is peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!
[00:16:44.634 --> 00:16:46.396]  That oppression is brown bags!
[00:16:46.956 --> 00:16:49.138]  That oppression is saying mother and father!
[00:16:49.318 --> 00:16:50.840]  That's hurtful to gays!
[00:16:53.203 --> 00:16:59.566]  This is total cultural overwrite with a plastic, fake, globalist culture that wants you to be one thing.
[00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:12.151]  Absolutely alone with no community, but also not an individual because then you see the television as your friends and the plastic culture as your fake community.
[00:17:12.451 --> 00:17:19.474]  They have to destroy real community and real communitarianism to then bring in a false communitarianism.
[00:17:19.694 --> 00:17:21.695]  They have to destroy true sustainability
[00:17:22.677 --> 00:17:27.638]  Being able to take care of yourself and bring in a false sustainability that actually makes your life unsustainable.
[00:17:28.879 --> 00:17:30.659]  And has a lot of trappings that sound reasonable.
[00:17:30.899 --> 00:17:33.400]  It's so sophisticated how they do this.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.141]  Now here's what's coming up today.
[00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:38.341]  Obviously, nuclear Iran deal.
[00:17:38.381 --> 00:17:42.883]  Saudi Arabia warns it will strike out on its own.
[00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:44.923]  That is big, big news.
[00:17:45.763 --> 00:17:46.884]  We told you this for years.
[00:17:47.144 --> 00:17:48.264]  It's already started in Europe.
[00:17:48.324 --> 00:17:49.104]  Now it's starting here.
[00:17:49.384 --> 00:17:50.965]  I've told you this probably
[00:17:52.088 --> 00:17:54.389]  A thousand times that this is the real sign.
[00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:55.570]  Financial Times of London.
[00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.871]  Top financial paper in the world.
[00:17:58.672 --> 00:17:58.972]  U.S.
[00:17:59.032 --> 00:18:06.115]  banks warn Fed interest rate cut could force them to charge for depositors.
[00:18:07.756 --> 00:18:09.497]  That is devaluation of the currency.
[00:18:09.557 --> 00:18:10.898]  That is Weimar beginnings.
[00:18:11.518 --> 00:18:13.799]  And then once it starts speeding up, folks, it's warp speed.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.983]  Now they've depressed the economy to try to balance out that they're actually inflating the currency.
[00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:25.017]  It's, it's, oh man, I tell you, it's so sophisticated what they're doing.
[00:18:25.617 --> 00:18:29.718]  And there's no way they're going to be able to keep control of it, no matter how many computerized frauds they've got.
[00:18:29.738 --> 00:18:32.718]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[00:18:33.339 --> 00:18:35.719]  This is the lineup for some really crazy stuff to happen.
[00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:40.160]  Also, Paul Watson's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.701]  Huge breaking news on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:49.082]  France planned false flag attack in Britain.
[00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:55.853]  Intelligence services considered assassinating Muslim leader and then blaming neo-Nazis.
[00:18:56.834 --> 00:19:06.760]  And this is in the major German-French papers, but it's not been picked up anywhere other than that yet.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.803]  This is breaking in the English-speaking press at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.776]  It's also being reported in Israel, so I guess that's English-speaking there as well.
[00:19:20.157 --> 00:19:25.819]  But the point is, is that this is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.700]  Paul Watson is going to be joining us.
[00:19:28.281 --> 00:19:31.682]  He can finally talk about his book and what really happened, some of what really happened inside the White House.
[00:19:32.343 --> 00:19:36.565]  Mr. Bongino, the Secret Service agent, is going to be joining us for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:44.269]  And then, in the last 30 minutes of the show, something really amazing happened when I was in Dallas on
[00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:46.637]  Thursday.
[00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:53.581]  And when we come back, I'm going to tell you what that is, and we're going to premiere an interview with her.
[00:19:54.422 --> 00:20:03.388]  The great filmmaker and composer in her own right, the daughter of the greatest filmmaker ever, Stanley Kubrick, is going to be joining us.
[00:20:03.908 --> 00:20:07.831]  Well, we have a taped interview with her with a lot of powerful information.
[00:20:07.851 --> 00:20:08.632]  She doesn't do interviews.
[00:20:09.815 --> 00:20:14.917]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:20:15.277 --> 00:20:23.759]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:31.482]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:20:32.002 --> 00:20:39.404]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.561]  What are bitcoins?
[00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:22.082]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.

[00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:44.836]  We are live.
[00:24:44.936 --> 00:24:46.317]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:46.857 --> 00:24:48.938]  Anyways, Vivian Kubrick.
[00:24:50.768 --> 00:24:53.430]  I know enough about Stanley Kubrick and I've watched all the films over and over again.
[00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.290]  I have all the box sets.
[00:24:54.330 --> 00:25:03.936]  Grew up with my mother and dad, you know, taking me to see all the movies when they would come back into theaters like 2001 Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove, you name it.
[00:25:03.996 --> 00:25:12.902]  My mother grew up walking, you know, a mile with her friends to go to the Paramount Theater here in Austin, Texas and watch the Kubrick films when they actually came out.
[00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:26.173]  She was a teenager whenever Dr. Strangelove came out famously exposing the RAND corporations and plans to cause a nuclear war so they could set up a military dictatorship.
[00:25:26.974 --> 00:25:30.175]  Now they just use Al Qaeda to take away our liberties.
[00:25:30.255 --> 00:25:31.955]  So we're very blessed.
[00:25:32.716 --> 00:25:35.056]  But it was, I mean, I'm not starstruck anymore.
[00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:41.519]  I've been invited to travel the world and go all these amazing places with really famous people, but it's all off record.
[00:25:42.599 --> 00:25:46.683]  And I'm glad that other interesting people want to know me.
[00:25:47.024 --> 00:25:49.406]  I'm kind of flabbergasted by it sometimes.
[00:25:50.927 --> 00:25:55.051]  Kurt Vonnegut was a listener, and I talked to him, and he sent me art, but he didn't want to come on the show.
[00:25:55.452 --> 00:25:58.795]  He said, I've sworn to not give any more speeches, and I'm done now.
[00:25:58.815 --> 00:26:00.176]  And he died like six months later.
[00:26:03.598 --> 00:26:06.860]  That's one of the few really famous people I can talk about because it's on record.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.861]  He sent me art and things.
[00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:13.424]  But so many other really, really famous, interesting people who are incredibly smart in person.
[00:26:14.025 --> 00:26:21.009]  Like you'll be around them talking to them and you can't believe they're actually talking to you and everything they say is just so thought-provoking.
[00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.611]  And I'm just honored to get to know all these people.
[00:26:26.132 --> 00:26:28.973]  Vivian Kubrick, of course, was his protégé.
[00:26:28.993 --> 00:26:30.293]  He said the smartest of his kids.
[00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:32.534]  She worked on a bunch of his films.
[00:26:33.054 --> 00:26:36.575]  And they would give her Nome diplomes so that people wouldn't say nepotism.
[00:26:36.615 --> 00:26:39.076]  And they'd say, who's that person you've got editing?
[00:26:39.116 --> 00:26:40.437]  Who's that person doing the score?
[00:26:40.457 --> 00:26:41.517]  Who's that person on camera?
[00:26:42.057 --> 00:26:42.497]  No, we're good.
[00:27:03.513 --> 00:27:06.314]  Fan, watched the documentaries, read a book about it.
[00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:10.615]  I'm not like a stalker fan to the point of I know everything, but I know a lot about Stanley Kubrick.
[00:27:10.835 --> 00:27:13.355]  And those are films I can watch over and over again.
[00:27:13.375 --> 00:27:21.017]  2001 Space Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket, and it's Vivian Vanessa Kubrick, born 1960.
[00:27:21.297 --> 00:27:22.717]  They've got her Wikipedia up there.
[00:27:23.657 --> 00:27:25.858]  But the issue is, is that
[00:27:28.069 --> 00:27:31.631]  Talking to her, it was just really enlightening, and I felt uplifted.
[00:27:32.232 --> 00:27:34.253]  And she just had a really great spirit about her.
[00:27:35.414 --> 00:27:48.343]  And the first night we went down to protest the Federal Reserve Wednesday night, about 200 people, 250 showed up, great people, impromptu to protest the real power structure that killed Kennedy when he signed the executive order to begin abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[00:27:50.157 --> 00:27:57.784]  And I was petting this beautiful American Bulldog, the prettiest I'd ever seen, that this fella actually was holding in his arms, this really big guy.
[00:27:57.804 --> 00:28:06.031]  And then I turned and this very interesting looking woman, like very alive eyes, said, look at my dog.
[00:28:06.792 --> 00:28:10.756]  And I was like, oh, sweet, very nice black poodle that she had in her arms, a medium-sized poodle.
[00:28:11.777 --> 00:28:14.199]  And I said, well, fantastic, great job.
[00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:14.980]  And then I left.
[00:28:16.191 --> 00:28:24.217]  And then the next night, we just had our march down to Dealey Plaza to protest the fact that they were going to restrict free speech in most of the city the next day.
[00:28:25.478 --> 00:28:39.928]  And Leanne, Richard pulls up after I've been marching for hours in the suburban to pick me up, take me back to the hotel, and Leanne gets in and goes, hey, that lady says she's Vivian Kubrick and, you know, would like to tell you a funny story about her dad and the CIA.
[00:28:41.109 --> 00:28:45.391]  But she never told me it was on or off record, so I'm not going to tell that story until she comes on in person sometime.
[00:28:45.852 --> 00:28:46.992]  So I said, well, get her number.
[00:28:47.313 --> 00:28:50.154]  And I drove by and I said, you know, that actually looks like Vivian Kubrick.
[00:28:50.214 --> 00:28:52.836]  I'd seen his daughters before, and she's in a bunch of his films.
[00:28:53.596 --> 00:28:54.937]  So I called the number.
[00:28:54.997 --> 00:28:56.378]  Sure enough, I looked it up online.
[00:28:56.398 --> 00:28:56.798]  That's her.
[00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:57.678]  She came to the hotel.
[00:28:58.059 --> 00:28:59.980]  We talked for about three hours, absolutely hit it off.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.121]  And then the next day she marched with us and got attacked by police.
[00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:04.582]  She was in all that.
[00:29:05.882 --> 00:29:09.224]  And we're now digging through all the footage and getting the really hardcore stuff.
[00:29:09.624 --> 00:29:14.866]  We just put out the first video we saw, which shows them shoving me and pushing people to the ground and stuff with the hardcore stuff.
[00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:18.168]  We're now digging it up to put a video out tonight on the nightly news.
[00:29:18.828 --> 00:29:25.271]  We have like so many cameras out there, but that's coming up in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast.
[00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:27.132]  I never asked her to do an interview.
[00:29:27.152 --> 00:29:29.373]  I said, if you ever feel like it, come down to Austin.
[00:29:29.393 --> 00:29:29.753]  We'll do it.
[00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:34.436]  It doesn't have to be Kubrick on Kubrick, you know, but obviously just about your view on the world.
[00:29:35.537 --> 00:29:39.460]  And then the next day after the police attacked her, she just came up and said, OK, I'll be interviewed.
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:46.125]  So we interviewed her live on the street right after the police attacked us under federal orders for no reason.
[00:29:46.665 --> 00:29:54.031]  And so this is the first interview she's done under the one in like 10 years premiering here, because she's a very private person.
[00:29:54.051 --> 00:29:57.353]  And it's going to be very, very interesting, to say the least.
[00:29:57.393 --> 00:29:57.954]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:59.249 --> 00:30:02.239]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.202 --> 00:30:05.871]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.453 --> 00:30:11.454]  I had tried everything.
[00:30:11.514 --> 00:30:13.655]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:30:13.875 --> 00:30:16.577]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:30:16.998 --> 00:30:21.481]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[00:30:21.861 --> 00:30:28.245]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:30:28.706 --> 00:30:39.133]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:30:39.893 --> 00:30:44.035]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:50.398]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:30:50.778 --> 00:30:51.778]  Now that's results.
[00:30:52.219 --> 00:30:58.621]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.

[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:16.781]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:31:17.181 --> 00:31:19.562]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:31:19.662 --> 00:31:19.942]  The U.S.
[00:31:20.002 --> 00:31:24.143]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:31:24.243 --> 00:31:26.823]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:31:27.203 --> 00:31:28.444]  They want that attack to come.
[00:31:28.684 --> 00:31:34.865]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:31:35.265 --> 00:31:37.729]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:31:37.949 --> 00:31:42.715]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:31:42.916 --> 00:31:50.346]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:31:50.646 --> 00:31:53.189]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:31:53.409 --> 00:31:56.052]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:31:56.533 --> 00:32:00.757]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[00:32:09.676 --> 00:32:20.066]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:32:20.366 --> 00:32:22.227]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:32:22.448 --> 00:32:23.128]  Fluoride!
[00:32:23.328 --> 00:32:25.110]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:31.536]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:32:31.796 --> 00:32:36.579]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:32:36.719 --> 00:32:42.843]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:32:43.044 --> 00:32:45.225]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:48.087]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:32:48.387 --> 00:32:51.769]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:56.493]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:57.333 --> 00:33:02.138]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:33:18.579 --> 00:33:20.361]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.342 --> 00:33:24.465]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:33:25.026 --> 00:33:27.368]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:27.969 --> 00:33:30.111]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:30.952 --> 00:33:36.435]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:36.475 --> 00:33:36.856]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:36.916 --> 00:33:37.996]  Central, we're live.
[00:33:39.157 --> 00:33:45.421]  Back 7 o'clock Central Standard Time with InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:56.848]  We're working on getting Max Keiser on because he's the one that's been saying for a long time that when they start trying to charge for deposits in the U.S.,
[00:33:57.888 --> 00:34:00.451]  You know that means inflation's about to really spike up.
[00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:02.394]  Well, now that's in the Financial Times of London.
[00:34:02.934 --> 00:34:03.195]  U.S.
[00:34:03.255 --> 00:34:09.262]  banks warn Fed interest cut could force them to charge depositors.
[00:34:09.502 --> 00:34:10.203]  That's a big deal.
[00:34:11.263 --> 00:34:13.224]  The biggest issue is Iran nuclear deal.
[00:34:13.665 --> 00:34:17.568]  Now Saudi Arabia warns they will strike on its own even if Israel, the U.S.
[00:34:17.628 --> 00:34:18.388]  or NATO don't.
[00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.610]  Over the peace deal, Iran is struck.
[00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:28.096]  And it makes them get rid of their enrichment down to 5%, which it's really even hard to have reactors for power at that level.
[00:34:29.196 --> 00:34:34.120]  So it looks like sanctions actually did bring Iran pretty much to their knees.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.763]  They failed in taking out Syria so they could then take out Iran.
[00:34:39.226 --> 00:34:41.387]  Because Syria is on Israel's flank.
[00:34:41.888 --> 00:34:43.068]  It had to be taken out first.
[00:34:43.088 --> 00:34:46.510]  That's why they used Saudi Arabia back to Al-Qaeda.
[00:34:47.551 --> 00:34:50.593]  But now Saudi Arabia is literally throwing a fit.
[00:34:50.933 --> 00:34:54.815]  And out of all the players in the Middle East, there's some real nasties out there.
[00:34:55.436 --> 00:35:01.859]  Saudi Arabia is hands down, and Al-Qaeda is hands down, heads above the rest.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.281]  In fact, way, way worse.
[00:35:05.735 --> 00:35:11.936]  Leagues worse than the other players, and just mischievous and wanting to dominate everything.
[00:35:12.897 --> 00:35:13.677]  And I see why.
[00:35:13.697 --> 00:35:26.060]  I mean, from 1903 to 1933, one group of Bedouin tribes took over what is Saudi Arabia, Syria, and so many other areas with British intelligence backing.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.801]  I mean, these guys had 200 square miles in between two mountain ranges of the worst desert in Saudi Arabia today.
[00:35:32.873 --> 00:35:35.375]  And under British intelligence backing, took the whole thing over.
[00:35:37.416 --> 00:35:40.078]  And now they want the entire world, basically.
[00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:43.080]  Not just North Africa, not just Central Asia.
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.203]  They're exporting their people all over the Caucasus to threaten the Russians.
[00:35:47.683 --> 00:35:50.625]  They publicly threatened to blow up the Olympics using Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:51.906 --> 00:35:56.369]  The head of Saudi intelligence, bin Sultan Bandar,
[00:35:57.893 --> 00:36:00.195]  Related to the Bin Ladens, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:36:00.595 --> 00:36:08.342]  And then I've got to have the TSA look me in the eyes and act like I've done something wrong and want to grab my genitals and put me in a scanner when the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:08.543 --> 00:36:19.612]  The illegitimate government runs it and I'm tired of all the cops in riot gear and all the cameras and all the armored vehicles and the billions of bullets saying it's for Al-Qaeda when you know full well it's for the American people.
[00:36:20.573 --> 00:36:21.814]  And now they admit it's for us.
[00:36:23.175 --> 00:36:24.697]  And I've had enough and I'm angry.
[00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:29.643]  And I have to go out and basically get roughed up by police.
[00:36:30.615 --> 00:36:35.259]  to have peaceful demonstration in Dallas for the First Amendment, which the mayor said was banned.
[00:36:35.799 --> 00:36:40.903]  The Dallas police did their job, and so they just sit in the Sheriff's Department under federal control to attack us.
[00:36:41.804 --> 00:36:44.566]  And the message is, we own these streets, you don't.
[00:36:44.626 --> 00:36:46.107]  It's pure gangster level.
[00:36:46.387 --> 00:36:48.429]  We even overheard the Dallas police the first night.
[00:36:48.929 --> 00:36:56.635]  But we missed them then, and I guess higher-ups countermanded it, saying, we gotta show him and show them these are our streets and they can't be out here, and that we're the boss.
[00:36:57.055 --> 00:37:00.198]  I mean, man, the level of block-headedness
[00:37:01.792 --> 00:37:07.114]  We gotta show them they just can't stand on the street corner and hand out flyers in America.
[00:37:07.454 --> 00:37:08.775]  We gotta... Well, you know what?
[00:37:08.815 --> 00:37:11.776]  You're gonna get shown by the establishment that you don't have anything as well.
[00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.097]  You fools!
[00:37:13.537 --> 00:37:14.477]  You want freedom.
[00:37:14.497 --> 00:37:15.478]  You want free speech.
[00:37:16.018 --> 00:37:17.318]  You want checks and balances.
[00:37:17.358 --> 00:37:19.179]  That's what made America so successful.
[00:37:20.379 --> 00:37:21.800]  Everybody else is authoritarian.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.741]  Everybody else doesn't let people demonstrate.
[00:37:24.761 --> 00:37:25.802]  And they're hell holes!
[00:37:26.723 --> 00:37:32.427]  Western civilization, cradle of freedom, and it's all being reversed, it's all being lost, and did you notice?
[00:37:32.788 --> 00:37:35.149]  All the prosperity's going out the window at the same time.
[00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:39.913]  And I want my children to grow up in a free country.
[00:37:39.973 --> 00:37:42.856]  Listen, if there was some great free country with lower taxes, I would leave.
[00:37:44.037 --> 00:37:51.102]  Except that I have, and there are a few actually that are better out there, I've looked into it, but I have such roots here that I'm not gonna abandon ship.
[00:37:52.059 --> 00:37:54.102]  And I see a lot of positive things happening too.
[00:37:54.483 --> 00:38:06.822]  Don't get me wrong, I see military waking up, a lot of police waking up, I see moves to start impeaching the Attorney General, moves to impeach Obama, I'm seeing a lot of awakening, that's good, but it's not enough, folks.
[00:38:08.459 --> 00:38:17.788]  I mean they're teaching kids 2 plus 2 equals 5 and that mom and dad is a bad word, father and mother, and that jelly, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist.
[00:38:18.228 --> 00:38:23.593]  To traumatize 7 year olds that they're racist because mommy gave them peanut butter and jelly sandwich so they can...
[00:38:24.614 --> 00:38:27.255]  Henpecked little kids and teach them they're bad because they're white.
[00:38:27.676 --> 00:38:30.697]  And the new Common Core curriculum says all whites are racist, basically.
[00:38:30.937 --> 00:38:32.018]  I covered that yesterday.
[00:38:32.098 --> 00:38:35.199]  I mean, this is the type of stuff we're dealing with in this country.
[00:38:35.259 --> 00:38:38.901]  Total balkanization, total psych warfare, totally criminal.
[00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:42.259]  The government is illegitimate at the top.
[00:38:42.879 --> 00:38:45.321]  It's trying to get the lower-level people to carry out crimes.
[00:38:45.541 --> 00:38:46.382]  It doesn't matter, though.
[00:38:46.942 --> 00:38:50.065]  The government is now illegitimate, from pillar to post.
[00:38:50.525 --> 00:38:54.248]  It didn't matter if the Dallas police followed the judge's injunction that we could demonstrate.
[00:38:54.688 --> 00:38:59.051]  It didn't matter if, after the ceremony, Dealey Plaza had to be opened up, and we went in first.
[00:38:59.532 --> 00:39:00.592]  They were opening all the barricades.
[00:39:00.632 --> 00:39:01.033]  We go in.
[00:39:02.594 --> 00:39:06.297]  The feds across the street in front of witnesses said, we're not going to let Alex Jones do that.
[00:39:06.637 --> 00:39:07.297]  Get over there.
[00:39:07.498 --> 00:39:11.140]  They masked up, went over and pushed us out of there to show us we're the boss.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.662]  Homeland Security, we run this show.
[00:39:13.922 --> 00:39:15.403]  We'll do what we want in America.
[00:39:19.126 --> 00:39:22.828]  They federalized units at every police department, every sheriff's department in major cities.
[00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:24.409]  Now they're federalizing everything else.
[00:39:26.431 --> 00:39:30.534]  And they sent thugs that had criminal glints in their eyes over there.
[00:39:31.803 --> 00:39:36.247]  And I just want to thank God for giving me the self-control to sit there and put up with it.
[00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:38.609]  We're going through all the footage to get the really hardcore stuff.
[00:39:38.969 --> 00:39:40.650]  Rob Dewitt walked down the street and ran back.
[00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.551]  That's how we got this from behind.
[00:39:41.891 --> 00:39:44.113]  None of us got the first of it, except on our live feeds.
[00:39:44.393 --> 00:39:52.920]  We have to go into the live feed archives to get the really brutal stuff, where they had that guy's head pinned up against the wall right there, ramming it, choking people, knocked a girl off a guy's shoulders.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.341]  This is the stuff I saw.
[00:39:54.701 --> 00:39:56.343]  We're going to get it all and have it by tonight's show.
[00:39:56.623 --> 00:40:01.287]  We all got back tired this weekend, and we just have dozens of hours of footage to go through, but we're going to do it.
[00:40:03.536 --> 00:40:04.857]  Now let's just stop right there.
[00:40:06.057 --> 00:40:14.322]  I want to shift gears to our top story that is up on Infowars.com.
[00:40:17.163 --> 00:40:18.964]  And I'm going to need a document cam here in just a moment.
[00:40:19.464 --> 00:40:22.686]  The story is up on Infowars.com.
[00:40:23.547 --> 00:40:27.209]  It is the top story on Infowars.com.
[00:40:29.139 --> 00:40:33.263]  France planned false flag terror attack in Britain.
[00:40:33.904 --> 00:40:40.050]  Intelligence services considered assassinating Muslim leader, blaming neo-Nazis.
[00:40:40.831 --> 00:40:42.613]  And I worked on this article with Watson.
[00:40:42.633 --> 00:40:47.118]  I asked his view on it from the different intel pieces we had, and I concur with his analysis 100%.
[00:40:49.096 --> 00:41:01.663]  This guy that calls for violence against non-Muslims and the takeover of Europe and turning it into a new Muslim holding is a MI6, MI5 operative.
[00:41:02.264 --> 00:41:09.428]  He is protected and he is connected directly to real terror attacks in France and French intelligence wants him dead.
[00:41:09.828 --> 00:41:13.971]  But notice they were going to use a false flag to blame it on neo-Nazis
[00:41:14.731 --> 00:41:18.176]  At the same time, this is breaking at Infowars.com.
[00:41:18.216 --> 00:41:22.863]  It's in French, German, and Israeli papers, but not in the Western news.
[00:41:23.343 --> 00:41:24.985]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:28.450]  Now...
[00:41:31.141 --> 00:41:34.964]  Joining us is Paul Joseph Watson from England breaking this.
[00:41:36.285 --> 00:41:52.876]  One of the biggest groups in England are the ones that are releasing these documents and basically, again, I'm not for assassinating people and false flagging and blaming it on the right wing to then restrict free speech in France, which they were going to double back and do, but this is a great example, if true,
[00:41:54.438 --> 00:42:02.950]  Of how these intelligence agencies, even when they get back at each other, use false flags to get the job done.
[00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.590]  Paul Watson.
[00:42:04.612 --> 00:42:05.653]  Hi Alex, good to be back.
[00:42:06.417 --> 00:42:09.820]  Yeah, it's a report by the pressure group Hope Not Hate.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:19.027]  It concerns a French intelligence plot to assassinate the Muslim hate preacher, the hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza.
[00:42:19.907 --> 00:42:30.876]  And basically what happened, they were frustrated at the fact that the British intelligence services, which as all our other research shows, clearly runs the European branch of Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:31.216 --> 00:42:32.337]  You've got hundreds of
[00:42:32.757 --> 00:42:43.086]  Terrorists flocking from Britain to Syria under the wing of Anjum Chowdhury, who is also connected to this, and again working for British intelligence.
[00:42:43.566 --> 00:42:51.873]  But this was based on a copy of a 1999 nail bomb attack which happened in London, killed three people, injured dozens.
[00:42:52.733 --> 00:42:55.734]  Uh, by David Copeland, who was a far-right terrorist.
[00:42:56.234 --> 00:43:09.918]  So the French plan to stage a false flag, use similar tactics, similar weapons to the Combat 18 Neo-Nazi group in Britain, then blame it on them and therefore avoid responsibility for their attack, but...
[00:43:10.859 --> 00:43:19.063]  As he said, they wanted to get rid of Abu Hamza because they thought that the British intelligence services were basically protecting him.
[00:43:19.683 --> 00:43:26.546]  In fact, they referred to London as Londonistan because of the ease with which these Al-Qaeda networks go in and out of the country.
[00:43:27.026 --> 00:43:31.528]  Because over and over again we've proven that British intel runs Al-Qaeda in Europe.
[00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:44.296]  Haroon Rashid Aswad, the so-called mastermind of the 7-7 bombings, was on the MI5 payroll, and he was one of the closest aides to Abu Hamza in the late 90s.
[00:43:44.376 --> 00:43:46.898]  So they were both working for British Intelligence.
[00:43:47.298 --> 00:43:59.326]  Hamza admitted he was working for Special Branch as far back as 1997, and then in 2006 he said his hate preaching had been tacitly approved by MI5.
[00:44:00.707 --> 00:44:02.148]  Let's be clear, let's be clear.
[00:44:02.248 --> 00:44:16.693]  A SWAT was over the 7-7 bombings on record and I literally had police threaten to arrest me when I was on the streets trying to interview witnesses about this with you just a few days after the 7-7 bombings.
[00:44:17.193 --> 00:44:20.134]  I went to London and we turned out it was a drill.
[00:44:20.254 --> 00:44:22.635]  They were patsies who thought they were part of a drill.
[00:44:22.675 --> 00:44:23.876]  Some figured it out and ran.
[00:44:24.196 --> 00:44:26.117]  They were shot to death at Canary.
[00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:52.028]  Uh, area, uh, there, um, and then, again, this is how they set them up, but the point is, this is on record, even Fox News, uh, and the Associated Press has reported that MI5, MI6 were handling, uh, the, the, a SWAT character, uh, who then was trying to create terror networks, but they couldn't do it, so then they, uh, they hired people who thought they were part of a drill
[00:44:52.948 --> 00:44:53.969]  And let's understand this.
[00:44:54.049 --> 00:44:56.371]  We can't get our reporters into England sometimes.
[00:44:56.792 --> 00:44:58.553]  Michael Savage can't get into England.
[00:44:59.874 --> 00:45:04.138]  Former Navy SEALs can't get into England if they ever criticize Islam in any way.
[00:45:04.778 --> 00:45:09.643]  But you're allowed to be actual Al-Qaeda and be involved in terror bombings.
[00:45:11.189 --> 00:45:11.749]  Well, exactly.
[00:45:11.769 --> 00:45:14.411]  I mean, look at this group called Al-Muhajiroun.
[00:45:14.451 --> 00:45:18.634]  It's led by Anjum Chowdhury and Omar Bakri Mohammed.
[00:45:19.094 --> 00:45:24.418]  That's the group that's training and equipping all the terrorists to travel from the UK to Syria.
[00:45:25.959 --> 00:45:34.225]  Back in 1997, Ron Susskind, a journalist, was told by the cohort of Chowdhury, Bakri Mohammed,
[00:45:34.745 --> 00:45:37.788]  That they were also working for British intelligence.
[00:45:37.828 --> 00:45:40.550]  So again, they admit they're working for British intel.
[00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.032]  They send all the terrorists out to Syria.
[00:45:43.353 --> 00:45:46.535]  When those terrorists come back, they're then arrested by the government.
[00:45:47.156 --> 00:45:50.218]  So they're all working for British intelligence.
[00:45:50.258 --> 00:45:54.082]  These are the chief European network leaders of Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:54.562 --> 00:46:00.586]  Another one, Abu Qatada, he was the inspiration for European Al Qaeda, turned out he was MI5.
[00:46:01.106 --> 00:46:24.182]  Every single case you look at leads back to British intelligence, and it's the same with this guy, Abu Hamza, which apparently is why the French were trying to assassinate him, because there were good agents within those security services in France, and they realised that, you know, he was one of the boys, he was on the team, so the only thing they could do is hatch this plot to get rid of him.
[00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:32.388]  Expanding on that, Paul, separately, five of the leaders of Al-Qaeda worldwide were all born in the U.S.
[00:46:33.088 --> 00:46:40.554]  and one of them is Jewish, Adam Gadon, and his father is the former, grandfather is the former head of the ADL.
[00:46:40.614 --> 00:46:45.898]  He was arrested beating up Muslims in Los Angeles until he figured out how to go
[00:46:46.698 --> 00:46:49.682]  Become Al Qaeda so that he can play the part of Al Qaeda.
[00:46:50.082 --> 00:46:52.225]  I mean, this is absolutely insane.
[00:46:52.245 --> 00:46:59.034]  And then they use the Al Qaeda threat to take our liberties while turning the Middle East and Egypt over to Al Qaeda.
[00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:10.692]  Well, I mean, look at the guy whose supposed plot, the Christmas Day bombing, led to the intensification of the TSA harassment, the body scanners, and war al-Awlaki.
[00:47:11.132 --> 00:47:25.595]  He was the inspiration for five of the 9-11 hijackers, yet as Fox News reported, he was dining at the Pentagon months after 9-11, and it was also admitted that he was working for the FBI.
[00:47:26.175 --> 00:47:43.853]  So the very inspiration behind the alleged hijackers on 9-11 visits the Pentagon months after and then, you know, goes on after that to become the inspiration for the Times Square bombing, that attempt at bombing, the Fort Hood shooting, he was the inspiration behind that.
[00:47:43.933 --> 00:47:49.739]  And by the way, they declared national security on that with Major Hassan for two years.
[00:47:49.779 --> 00:47:57.706]  He was being run by a lockie and the CIA knew and they declared national security on those emails and will not even declare it a terror attack.
[00:47:57.726 --> 00:47:59.408]  Let's put the Fox News headline back up.
[00:47:59.928 --> 00:48:00.949]  The guys were able to find it.
[00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:02.351]  Exclusive!
[00:48:02.451 --> 00:48:05.715]  Al Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11.
[00:48:05.735 --> 00:48:07.457]  That's actually not an exclusive.
[00:48:07.497 --> 00:48:10.040]  We actually broke that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:10.881 --> 00:48:17.709]  But the whole issue is that even when I mention that now on national TV or radio, they laugh and say I'm a liar.
[00:48:18.149 --> 00:48:21.153]  The number two guy on Al Qaeda, who I predicted they would fake kill,
[00:48:21.553 --> 00:48:22.633]  Glenn, they killed him in a drone strike.
[00:48:22.653 --> 00:48:23.453]  Totally made up, folks.
[00:48:23.473 --> 00:48:25.454]  He's got a nose job, beard's cut off.
[00:48:25.494 --> 00:48:27.874]  He's in probably Hawaii right now with 15 mistresses.
[00:48:28.415 --> 00:48:29.995]  You know, at a topless bar.
[00:48:30.155 --> 00:48:32.255]  Literally, ladies, just like the 9-11 hijackers.
[00:48:32.656 --> 00:48:33.456]  Totally set up.
[00:48:33.516 --> 00:48:35.496]  Double, triple agents, bare minimum.
[00:48:35.536 --> 00:48:36.816]  Triple crossed right there.
[00:48:37.177 --> 00:48:40.537]  But the issue is, this is an intelligence op, and why do they do it?
[00:48:40.597 --> 00:48:42.138]  To take our liberties, Paul.
[00:48:42.478 --> 00:48:43.238]  This is incredible.
[00:48:45.185 --> 00:49:04.076]  And they also do it to kind of rack it up this racial strife both in the US and Britain because you remember the Woolwich attacks, the killing of Lee Rigby, well it turned out that the culprit of that was again a protege of Anjum Chowdhury, who is the guy which according to this report
[00:49:04.716 --> 00:49:10.798]  Has become, his group has become the single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent history.
[00:49:11.278 --> 00:49:19.221]  Yet his cohort admitted before 7-7 that his group was working with and with the approval of MI5.
[00:49:19.621 --> 00:49:24.663]  The biggest gateway to terrorism in British history and they're working hand in hand with MI5.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.282]  Good job, Paul, and I want to give credit where credit's due.
[00:49:30.482 --> 00:49:34.085]  I thought we were the first English-speaking group to put this out.
[00:49:34.145 --> 00:49:38.188]  The Huffington Post actually had it, but I'm glad you've got a report on it pointing out the background.
[00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:41.731]  French security services plan to assassinate Abu Hamza.
[00:49:42.352 --> 00:49:45.414]  And then here it is now out of the Telegraph, just downbreaking as well.
[00:49:45.434 --> 00:49:46.995]  So we're all basically breaking at the same time.
[00:49:47.476 --> 00:49:51.239]  French spies and neo-Nazi plot to kill Abu Hamza.
[00:49:51.259 --> 00:49:55.462]  I mean, that Abu Hamza guy is just a disgusting blob.
[00:49:56.383 --> 00:50:00.850]  Trying to radicalize everybody so they can then again take British folks' rights.
[00:50:01.411 --> 00:50:02.473]  It's so disgusting.
[00:50:02.513 --> 00:50:09.303]  I mean, this is... I am so sick of being treated like a terrorist when I'm totally innocent and the government runs the terrorist poll.
[00:50:10.677 --> 00:50:11.318]  Well, exactly.
[00:50:11.718 --> 00:50:16.942]  But those other reports you mentioned don't talk about the fact that Abu Hamza is MI5.
[00:50:17.002 --> 00:50:21.666]  So they only give you half the story, which is why people are coming to Infowars.com.
[00:50:22.066 --> 00:50:23.688]  I'm so sick of Adam Hamza.
[00:50:24.048 --> 00:50:26.710]  I saw that fat pig on television when I was over in England.
[00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:30.053]  Yeah, he's on television over there calling for killing everybody.
[00:50:30.393 --> 00:50:33.015]  I mean, it's so obvious he's a government agent and it's come out he is.
[00:50:33.055 --> 00:50:33.756]  He brags he is.
[00:50:33.916 --> 00:50:36.338]  Well, eventually they had to extradite him.
[00:50:36.378 --> 00:50:39.621]  It took years and years, despite his clear links to Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:43.544]  Finally, in October last year, they extradited him to the U.S.
[00:50:43.584 --> 00:50:50.049]  So, these, uh, these patsies, these stooges, only have a limited time span before they become redundant.
[00:50:50.249 --> 00:50:54.153]  I guess they were playing clips of him, but they do have a guy, who's the guy I saw on TV that looks just like him?
[00:50:54.713 --> 00:50:55.875]  That's Jem Chowdhury.
[00:50:56.276 --> 00:50:56.977]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:57.638 --> 00:50:58.439]  He's still active.
[00:50:58.699 --> 00:50:59.360]  Yeah, that's the one.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.302]  That's just disgusting.
[00:51:00.742 --> 00:51:02.385]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:02.445 --> 00:51:03.046]  Stay with us.
[00:51:03.447 --> 00:51:05.590]  Paul Watson, thank you so much.
[00:51:06.171 --> 00:51:08.174]  Come back and add any other cool key tidbits.
[00:51:08.194 --> 00:51:09.015]  I want to finish up with this.
[00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:20.180]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:22.343]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:51:22.543 --> 00:51:23.243]  Fluoride!
[00:51:23.424 --> 00:51:25.005]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:25.346 --> 00:51:31.672]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:51:31.912 --> 00:51:36.696]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:51:36.836 --> 00:51:42.961]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:45.323]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:51:45.583 --> 00:51:48.205]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:51.888]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[00:54:17.245 --> 00:54:18.785]  It's rollin' around a bit.
[00:54:19.506 --> 00:54:23.348]  And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
[00:54:23.808 --> 00:54:25.529]  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison.

[00:54:30.242 --> 00:54:42.634]  Folks, coming up, the last 30 minutes of the broadcast, the daughter of Stanley Kubrick, a filmmaker and composer in her own right, an incredible lady to talk to.
[00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:44.136]  Exclusive interview.
[00:54:44.176 --> 00:54:51.202]  She's done like one discussion, I looked it up in like a decade, about a film and a film panel, and that's it.
[00:54:52.188 --> 00:54:55.631]  And I'm just flattered that she's a listener and really enjoyed talking to her and learned a lot.
[00:54:55.651 --> 00:55:07.820]  She says she's going to come to Austin sometime, probably come on air with us and obviously let us pick her brain about so many things that are out there because Stanley Kubrick was just, the words were close, very, very private.
[00:55:09.341 --> 00:55:10.742]  And people don't really know a lot about him.
[00:55:10.782 --> 00:55:17.828]  In fact, I was told quite a bit and a lot of it wasn't off record, but I'm still just not going to talk about it until she says something incredibly interesting.
[00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:20.703]  I mean, she was in there working on a bunch of his films.
[00:55:20.763 --> 00:55:22.144]  She was his main protege.
[00:55:23.125 --> 00:55:32.512]  And it certainly wasn't nepotism because you could see the scores she came out with and the work she did on everything from Eyes Wide Shut to Full Metal Jacket.
[00:55:32.972 --> 00:55:33.633]  And it's amazing.
[00:55:33.653 --> 00:55:34.354]  That's coming up.
[00:55:34.694 --> 00:55:35.494]  Dan Bongino.
[00:55:36.415 --> 00:55:37.515]  Will be joining us.
[00:55:37.556 --> 00:55:41.517]  He can now finally speak about some of the stuff that he did during the Secret Service that's in his book.
[00:55:41.557 --> 00:55:45.538]  Now that his book is officially out, the publisher will allow him to talk about that, obviously.
[00:55:45.558 --> 00:55:46.899]  That's for 30 minutes.
[00:55:46.939 --> 00:55:48.059]  Paul Watson's with us right now.
[00:55:48.439 --> 00:55:53.501]  Briefly, in the last decade plus, the first person I learned about it was about 14 years ago.
[00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:59.003]  My girlfriend, now my wife, liked this particular type of coffee that was from Chiapas, Mexico.
[00:55:59.023 --> 00:56:00.544]  It was pretty expensive.
[00:56:01.084 --> 00:56:03.725]  And then I learned that the owners of the company were fans
[00:56:04.565 --> 00:56:11.690]  And I wanted to put out a private label of it myself, but then they're in some national food stores and got cold feet.
[00:56:12.731 --> 00:56:24.079]  And then I did research, and lo and behold, learned that folks that we've worked with for a while, InterHealth Botanicals, are able to secure it, but they get it directly from the same co-op in Chiapas, and it is the same coffee.
[00:56:24.099 --> 00:56:27.922]  I've been drinking this coffee, I say 10 years, it's 14 years since I met my girlfriend.
[00:56:28.462 --> 00:56:29.463]  And it is my favorite coffee.
[00:56:30.043 --> 00:56:35.027]  And it's Arabica, and in the office there's like 15 different flavors of it, you know, types and roast.
[00:56:35.487 --> 00:56:39.730]  But we all, the whole office tested it for a few weeks, and we decided on this particular blend.
[00:56:40.671 --> 00:56:42.372]  Unanimously, it's a medium roast.
[00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:48.896]  Wake Up America Immune Support, available at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:50.598 --> 00:56:56.360]  One pound of it is $17, and the other brand of it is like $30 something.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:03.042]  Just to give you an idea, folks, this is a really gourmet coffee at a reasonable price, and the small amount of profit we make helps fund the operation.
[00:57:03.622 --> 00:57:09.664]  And it's called Wake Up America Patriot Blend, and it's a shade grown in the mountains of Chiapas.
[00:57:09.704 --> 00:57:11.805]  It's basically like Guatemalan coffee, but better in my view.
[00:57:11.825 --> 00:57:14.806]  Guatemala was my favorite previous to that.
[00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:16.225]  I don't
[00:57:38.835 --> 00:57:48.044]  And just like the nascent iodine, the first product of InfoWars Life, of these great vitamins, minerals, supplements, and high quality food products we're going to be rolling out.
[00:57:49.205 --> 00:57:54.470]  If you go there, you've heard nothing but unanimous love for this nascent iodine.
[00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:56.572]  It's proprietary, it's really special.
[00:57:56.912 --> 00:57:58.674]  That's available at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:57:58.714 --> 00:58:01.677]  All the things it does for the thyroid and the body, and personally for my clarity.
[00:58:02.077 --> 00:58:05.421]  And then of course I'm a big coffee drinker, as you know, and this is my favorite coffee.
[00:58:05.781 --> 00:58:12.047]  For two years I've tried to put it out, did a lot of research, and then it was hiding in plain view with folks we'd already been working with for a decade.
[00:58:12.087 --> 00:58:13.249]  Isn't that funny how that works?
[00:58:13.929 --> 00:58:18.330]  Is that great minds think alike, or patriot minds think alike.
[00:58:18.531 --> 00:58:19.531]  So that's what's going on.
[00:58:19.551 --> 00:58:20.451]  We're gonna have a one-minute break.
[00:58:20.791 --> 00:58:21.852]  Talk to Paul for five minutes.
[00:58:21.872 --> 00:58:30.074]  Let him finish up on this huge news of the French planting a false flag to take out a MI5 agent.
[00:58:30.434 --> 00:58:31.175]  He's a guy's an agent.
[00:58:31.195 --> 00:58:31.875]  He's not just a minion.
[00:58:33.491 --> 00:58:37.172]  Uh, and then we've also got, um, so much more coming up.
[00:58:37.192 --> 00:58:39.993]  But, uh, the new Wake of America Patriot Blend Coffee.

[00:58:59.756 --> 00:59:02.500]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:59:02.781 --> 00:59:07.608]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:59:07.809 --> 00:59:14.980]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:20.503]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:59:20.743 --> 00:59:24.326]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[00:59:38.193 --> 00:59:40.454]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:59:40.694 --> 00:59:45.256]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:59:45.456 --> 00:59:47.897]  Hand crank shortwave AM FM radios.

[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.581]  We're getting prepared.
[00:59:56.821 --> 00:59:57.221]  Are you?
[00:59:57.481 --> 00:59:58.582]  InfoWarshop.com
[01:00:02.697 --> 01:00:04.619]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.863]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.471 --> 01:00:15.092]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.772 --> 01:00:16.793]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:18.635]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.296 --> 01:00:20.116]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.877 --> 01:00:21.818]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:26.062]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:30.726]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:39.174]  Coming up, I'm gonna break down how the Internet is gamed at just a few of the angles of why
[01:00:40.302 --> 01:00:42.584]  The system having your data is a bad thing.
[01:00:42.604 --> 01:00:43.565]  You say, well, I have nothing to hide.
[01:00:43.605 --> 01:00:44.305]  Why should I worry?
[01:00:44.325 --> 01:00:45.987]  I'm going to give you a few examples of that.
[01:00:46.347 --> 01:00:47.408]  There's some new stories out.
[01:00:47.428 --> 01:00:48.949]  I see them up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:51.031]  Trends faked by robots.
[01:00:51.131 --> 01:00:52.012]  Bogus accounts.
[01:00:52.092 --> 01:00:52.672]  Dog Twitter.
[01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:57.196]  I'm going to explain exactly what's going on there coming up in the next segment and some other news.
[01:00:57.476 --> 01:00:59.118]  And then open the phones up for your calls.
[01:00:59.278 --> 01:01:01.220]  And then, of course, we've got Dan Bongino.
[01:01:02.622 --> 01:01:10.955]  The Secret Service agent joining us live, he can finally tell us some of what's not classified or restricted about being inside the bubble with Obama now that his book's out.
[01:01:10.975 --> 01:01:13.579]  He's not bound by the publisher to not be able to talk about it.
[01:01:15.066 --> 01:01:18.008]  Frequent guest, one of our favorite guests, very interesting, very smart guy.
[01:01:18.028 --> 01:01:20.611]  We'll get his take on the economy, a host of issues as well.
[01:01:20.631 --> 01:01:26.115]  Because Secret Service has a lot of education in economics and how money works, so it's always good to talk to Bongino.
[01:01:26.776 --> 01:01:36.224]  But right now, Paul, finishing up with your story, that, you know, as you said, this is now in the London Telegraph, but they don't tell you, I wish they told everybody,
[01:01:36.944 --> 01:01:52.399]  Uh, that the guy is admittedly in previous mainstream news an MI5 agent until they set him up and then now there's other minions they're protecting that are MI5 assets who are actually trying to turn... What do you think the goal is?
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.302]  ...of bringing in the radical Muslims and trying to turn England over to Al Qaeda and the rest of the world.
[01:01:57.642 --> 01:01:59.263]  Why does the New Order love Al Qaeda?
[01:01:59.543 --> 01:02:01.004]  Is it just the Saudi Arabian money?
[01:02:01.044 --> 01:02:05.507]  I mean, why did the British intelligence create Saudi Arabia?
[01:02:06.267 --> 01:02:09.589]  I mean, they just are in love with the Wahhabist.
[01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:18.895]  Well, it's because they use them as chess pieces around the world to take over rogue states, countries that are not part of the New World Order.
[01:02:18.915 --> 01:02:25.819]  I mean, they paid Al-Qaeda £100,000 back in 1996 to assassinate Gaddafi, so they were on that early.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:30.763]  And then, of course, over ten years ago it came out that the MI5 had
[01:02:31.403 --> 01:02:40.952]  Double agents within the real IRA's Omar bomb team actually carried out the bombing which killed 29 people, a lot of children amongst them.
[01:02:41.412 --> 01:02:46.777]  So these people are ruthless and then people say, oh well they couldn't have killed Diana or Dr David Kelly.
[01:02:47.157 --> 01:02:50.581]  They kill kids, they carry out terrorist attacks on a regular basis.
[01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:56.262]  Uh, you know, IRA attacks throughout the 90s had MI5 fingerprints all over them.
[01:02:56.282 --> 01:03:04.264]  Uh, and then it came out, you know, you had headlines like, the army asked me to make bombs for the IRA, told me I had the prime minister's blessing, then tried to kill me.
[01:03:04.644 --> 01:03:09.505]  That was Kevin Fulton, who was quote, ordered by his handlers to carry out terrorist attacks.
[01:03:09.525 --> 01:03:12.006]  By the way, we had him on the show, wasn't he called Steak Knife?
[01:03:12.726 --> 01:03:13.566]  Steak Knife, yeah.
[01:03:14.607 --> 01:03:15.567]  What happened to Steak Knife?
[01:03:16.846 --> 01:03:18.707]  I haven't seen any update on it.
[01:03:18.767 --> 01:03:20.488]  I know there wasn't much attention at the time.
[01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:24.651]  One of the British commandos we interviewed got killed after he was on.
[01:03:25.071 --> 01:03:26.492]  I can't even keep track of all this.
[01:03:27.072 --> 01:03:28.233]  I tell you, it's so frustrating.
[01:03:29.253 --> 01:03:37.198]  Well, I mean, watch out for the SAS sniper who recently blew the whistle on the fact that an SAS elite unit killed Diana.
[01:03:37.498 --> 01:03:39.559]  Darling, he's going to be hanging around very long, do you?
[01:03:41.195 --> 01:03:45.847]  Man, I tell you, my government's corrupt and so is yours, but the British government's been totally caught doing this.
[01:03:46.268 --> 01:03:47.451]  What's wrong with Parliament?
[01:03:47.511 --> 01:03:48.553]  Are they just intimidated?
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:58.747]  Well, there's a few in Parliament that speak out against it, but... Why would you authorize MI5 to pick a place to blow up little kids?
[01:03:58.807 --> 01:04:03.431]  I mean, if they're going to blow people up, at least blow up an army base or something to blame it on.
[01:04:03.572 --> 01:04:04.392]  At least that's men.
[01:04:04.412 --> 01:04:08.116]  I'm not even saying that's okay, but my God, blowing up kids, man.
[01:04:08.456 --> 01:04:09.477]  I agree with Tony Montana.
[01:04:09.537 --> 01:04:10.478]  No women, no kids.
[01:04:11.058 --> 01:04:12.780]  I mean, it just makes me want to throw up.
[01:04:14.107 --> 01:04:18.209]  Well, their excuse was they didn't want their double agent to have his cover blown.
[01:04:18.649 --> 01:04:25.972]  So if you think that's worth killing 29 people for, then, you know, not a very reasonable argument, is it?
[01:04:27.012 --> 01:04:30.374]  Well, I mean, it shows how Oklahoma City, they picked him because of a daycare.
[01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:33.215]  McVeigh threw a fit, this has been confirmed.
[01:04:33.935 --> 01:04:38.177]  He was willing to blow up a federal building to go after the right wing, but not kill kids.
[01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:39.378]  So they just set him up.
[01:04:42.566 --> 01:04:43.006]  Amazing.
[01:04:43.206 --> 01:04:44.907]  Alright, Paul Watson, thank you so much.
[01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:49.188]  I really appreciate you coming on with us, and you're going to have more on this at Infowars.com?

[01:06:15.449 --> 01:06:23.933]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.

[01:07:09.082 --> 01:07:13.649]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:16.774]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:07:16.935 --> 01:07:22.163]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:07:22.503 --> 01:07:24.106]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:07:24.406 --> 01:07:25.727]  We are what we eat.
[01:07:26.047 --> 01:07:30.390]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:34.692]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[01:07:34.952 --> 01:07:37.254]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:07:37.494 --> 01:07:43.417]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:16.980]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.820]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.281]  You want answers?
[01:08:21.061 --> 01:08:21.981]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:22.601 --> 01:08:26.242]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:30.883]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:47.034 --> 01:08:54.383]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, after he leaves us at the bottom of the hour, we're going to have open phones on everything we talked about in the last hour.
[01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:56.786]  Dan Bongino is going to be with us for the next 20 minutes.
[01:08:57.126 --> 01:08:59.730]  We're going to be talking to him until the bottom of the hour, for the next 23 minutes or so.
[01:09:01.618 --> 01:09:03.800]  And then, of course, Iran nuclear deal.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:10.044]  Saudi Arabia warns it will strike on its own and says they've got nuclear weapons from Pakistan.
[01:09:10.084 --> 01:09:11.225]  Isn't that just precious?
[01:09:12.185 --> 01:09:12.886]  Also, U.S.
[01:09:12.946 --> 01:09:17.469]  banks warned Fed interest cuts could force them to charge depositors.
[01:09:17.949 --> 01:09:23.533]  More is coming out on how big corporations in the White House use fake bots to manipulate public opinion.
[01:09:23.553 --> 01:09:27.356]  I'm going to be breaking some of that down, explaining what's really going on.
[01:09:27.416 --> 01:09:28.377]  Of course, top story.
[01:09:29.037 --> 01:09:43.641]  On Infowars.com, this is confirmed in the foreign press as well, France planned a false flag terror attack in Britain to kill radical Muslims that were really British intelligence agents that were staging terror attacks in France.
[01:09:44.242 --> 01:09:45.882]  And they were going to blame the right wing for it.
[01:09:45.982 --> 01:09:49.103]  Man, talk about going after all of the socialist enemies.
[01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:58.086]  So get rid of some of the British agents that are staging terror attacks that are Muslims, because it's well known Britain pretty much runs Al-Qaeda.
[01:09:58.886 --> 01:10:01.167]  Look at what they're doing right now against Syria.
[01:10:01.627 --> 01:10:03.647]  Pretty sophisticated cloak and dagger stuff.
[01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:06.048]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:10:07.168 --> 01:10:13.590]  I've really wanted to get him on on this subject for a while, but he was bound until the book came out to talk about it.
[01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:17.591]  I, a few months ago, got an advance copy of
[01:10:18.491 --> 01:10:47.611]  Dan Bongino's life inside the bubble why a top-ranked Secret Service agent walked away from it all Really interesting stuff in the book, and I know we can't get into all of it obviously Our folks won't get the book and he certainly needs the support because he left a well-paying job And you know obviously as a family he's running for Congress right now We've been supportive of him, and we'll give you his Twitter and Facebook and also his main website in a moment just Bongino.com But I specifically want you now in context
[01:10:48.251 --> 01:11:05.607]  With Ben Stein saying Obama is a criminal liar, impeaching him with all the lies about Obamacare, Obama saying he can act as a dictator to shut off power plants or to legalize illegals or to fix his own legislation, create a crisis, it's horrible, make me a dictator, I can fix it.
[01:11:06.407 --> 01:11:08.689]  I mean, this is cloward and piven, this is wreck the country.
[01:11:09.089 --> 01:11:28.103]  Tell us in the context of working as one of his top agents, the top agent running as far and details, which I've been told is the most dangerous and most important position, because that's where things aren't as controllable, what should happen to Obama and what you think he'll do now that he's a cornered rat.
[01:11:28.744 --> 01:11:30.405]  Dan Bongino, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:11:31.062 --> 01:11:31.823]  No, I appreciate it.
[01:11:31.903 --> 01:11:32.443]  Thanks a lot.
[01:11:32.483 --> 01:11:33.484]  Thanks for the opportunity.
[01:11:33.824 --> 01:11:37.547]  Yeah, the problem now is we're getting into these distraction strategies all the time.
[01:11:37.567 --> 01:11:39.788]  Did you notice now the Iranian deal?
[01:11:39.808 --> 01:11:45.172]  That was convenient right after the 50th anniversary of JFK when that story blew through the news.
[01:11:45.672 --> 01:11:48.494]  Then Obamacare got back in for a quick second.
[01:11:48.514 --> 01:11:51.696]  All of a sudden, you know, wow, abracadabra.
[01:11:52.177 --> 01:11:55.399]  Look, there's a deal with Iran that really is no deal at all.
[01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:58.561]  Keep in mind, I'm not an interventionist by any stretch.
[01:11:58.601 --> 01:12:00.642]  I mean, my libertarian streak is strong.
[01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:03.984]  But if you're going to negotiate, at least negotiate in good faith.
[01:12:05.045 --> 01:12:07.367]  I don't even know what to say anymore about this, Alex.
[01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:15.692]  It's like every single time that something breaks bad, there's a media cover story that reappears and distracts people like a shiny red ball.
[01:12:15.712 --> 01:12:19.875]  I mean, we're in a really dangerous place right now with this administration.
[01:12:20.195 --> 01:12:21.956]  They use the appendages and the tools
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:31.825]  As tactical and strategic propaganda weapon to get the American people to just not pay attention to the evaporation of their liberty.
[01:12:32.702 --> 01:12:33.762]  Let me just say this one thing.
[01:12:34.303 --> 01:12:44.806]  If your health care liberty doesn't matter to you, which is really evaporating in front of your very eyes with Obamacare, I mean in live time right now, then really, what other form of liberty really matters?
[01:12:44.846 --> 01:12:46.546]  Do you really even have political liberty?
[01:12:46.686 --> 01:12:47.347]  Oh, we can vote.
[01:12:47.387 --> 01:12:47.867]  Vote for what?
[01:12:47.887 --> 01:12:48.927]  You don't have your health care liberty?
[01:12:49.227 --> 01:12:52.568]  You're being taxed at confiscatory rates under this administration.
[01:12:53.029 --> 01:12:58.570]  And all of a sudden, again, like I said, a deal, a so-called deal appears with Iran to distract everybody.
[01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:00.671]  So it is, it's so troubling.
[01:13:02.021 --> 01:13:03.690]  People have to speak out.
[01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:04.976]  I mean, someone's got to do something.
[01:13:06.505 --> 01:13:18.828]  Dan, what do you expect knowing Obama personally and being around him all over the world and at the White House, knowing his handlers, knowing him, his arrogance, what do you expect him to do?
[01:13:18.868 --> 01:13:26.990]  Because even though they have all these distractions, they're not working, he's losing multiple points a week, he's in free fall, they're going to pull something.
[01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:28.591]  Is it a war?
[01:13:28.831 --> 01:13:31.771]  Is it trying to stir up a race war?
[01:13:31.811 --> 01:13:34.012]  I mean, what in your gut are you concerned about?
[01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:37.895]  Well, a foreign intervention would not be off the table.
[01:13:37.995 --> 01:13:39.377]  I mean, it's happened in the past.
[01:13:39.417 --> 01:13:47.689]  We had, you know, Clinton lobbed the, uh, cruise missiles, uh, which wasn't even, uh, you know, he wouldn't kill a few, uh, goats in the middle of the... wasn't that the story?
[01:13:47.729 --> 01:13:49.712]  Lobbed them into the... there wasn't even anybody around?
[01:13:49.732 --> 01:13:50.153]  Sure.
[01:13:50.253 --> 01:13:53.697]  So, what bothers me is that I can't give you an answer, Alex.
[01:13:53.717 --> 01:14:01.466]  You know, what government's supposed to do, the sole role of government, Article 1, Section 8, is to be limited and provide certainty, right?
[01:14:01.746 --> 01:14:07.232]  The rules of the level playing field, both Alex Jones, Dan Bongino, both understand we both play by the same rules.
[01:14:07.392 --> 01:14:09.655]  Government can't come after me and give you a pass, right?
[01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:16.467]  Well, I say that not to get off on a tangent, but to tell you the problem is I don't know what he's going to do next.
[01:14:16.908 --> 01:14:17.969]  That's the problem.
[01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:20.713]  There's absolutely no certainty with this administration.
[01:14:20.733 --> 01:14:23.917]  I mean, things you and I thought only happened in the movies.
[01:14:23.937 --> 01:14:26.781]  Like, come on, the government doesn't need the IRS to go after people.
[01:14:27.022 --> 01:14:27.923]  That's only in the movies.
[01:14:28.323 --> 01:14:28.944]  No, it does!
[01:14:29.004 --> 01:14:30.545]  They actually apologize for it.
[01:14:30.846 --> 01:14:36.751]  I mean, you know, even the little scandals, like the extortion... I don't want to say little, I don't mean it in a qualitative way.
[01:14:37.011 --> 01:14:41.936]  The scandals that the media has not even paid attention to in this fog of scandals, this administration.
[01:14:42.416 --> 01:14:44.898]  You know, the extortion 17, I say that to some people.
[01:14:45.279 --> 01:14:46.279]  They're like, what are you talking about?
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.641]  I say, exactly, that's the problem.
[01:14:48.161 --> 01:15:02.315]  Like the fact that one of the largest losses of life in Afghanistan in one day on this Chinook with these heroic Navy SEALs over there who are going in this mission that they can't possibly win anymore and no one's even heard of it.
[01:15:02.736 --> 01:15:07.440]  So the fact that we don't know what's going to happen next is the worst answer I could possibly give you.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.705]  I mean if that's the worst he did was lob a few cruise missiles in like Clinton did,
[01:15:12.305 --> 01:15:14.786]  You could say there was at least some predictability right or wrong.
[01:15:14.866 --> 01:15:15.606]  I have no idea.
[01:15:15.686 --> 01:15:16.226]  I really don't.
[01:15:16.246 --> 01:15:20.208]  He just seems to use government like a kid uses a chainsaw.
[01:15:20.248 --> 01:15:21.148]  Sure, sure.
[01:15:21.368 --> 01:15:30.271]  Well, what about the issue of even Democrats saying you can't be a dictator, you can't give waivers to certain companies on your health care law.
[01:15:31.131 --> 01:15:59.599]  via just executive fiat and you can't just say what stands and what doesn't in Obamacare and you can't just by fiat stop all the deportations and you can't just selectively shut down what power plants you want but he's doing it so if he doesn't get impeached now or if he doesn't get in trouble it sets the precedent and I think this country's basically done because a lot of the Republican leadership have shown that they'll use whatever undue powers have been
[01:16:01.073 --> 01:16:04.774]  cemented for themselves as well, and I think it's just a culture of corruption.
[01:16:05.054 --> 01:16:06.395]  You've lived in the bubble.
[01:16:06.435 --> 01:16:08.355]  Your book is called Life Inside the Bubble.
[01:16:08.795 --> 01:16:12.176]  What is happening up there where they are above the law?
[01:16:12.216 --> 01:16:16.617]  The big banks can launder hundreds of billions of dollars, get caught, not even get in trouble.
[01:16:18.198 --> 01:16:20.358]  Stuff that makes Bernie Madoff look like a choir boy.
[01:16:20.718 --> 01:16:25.440]  What I'm saying is, as somebody who's been a New York cop, Secret Service agent, lived in DC,
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:35.333]  Knowing the culture of corruption with your criminology background, I see this either we turn the tide now or corruption grows to the point where everything collapses.
[01:16:35.793 --> 01:16:38.537]  Yeah, I mean, I don't disagree with you at all.
[01:16:38.557 --> 01:16:41.922]  You know, I used the example of the situation in Benghazi.
[01:16:42.543 --> 01:16:52.107]  You know, I identify as a Republican at the polls, but I have no problem whatsoever, anyone who follows me on social media, going after the Republicans on this too.
[01:16:52.147 --> 01:16:55.388]  Both sides are in bed with each other on situations like this.
[01:16:55.588 --> 01:17:07.233]  From what I've heard, and I can't prove it, but I'm hearing from some good sources of mine, that there were some Republicans who were aware of some stuff going on over there, pre-Libya, pre-Benghazi, that they don't want to be outed on either.
[01:17:07.273 --> 01:17:09.154]  Yeah, John McCain, Lindsey Graham.
[01:17:09.810 --> 01:17:19.938]  Yeah, so instead of doing, you know, the right thing, they do the easy thing, which is, oh, the public will forget about this and forget about that, and it makes you wonder, you know, who's the real bad guy?
[01:17:19.998 --> 01:17:29.425]  And I say all the time, I tweet this out as often as I can, because I mean it, I want people to really remember that the battle's not Republican versus Democrat, that battle's already lost.
[01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:33.808]  The battle's elitist versus just grassroots rank-and-file America.
[01:17:33.828 --> 01:17:34.288]  Exactly.
[01:17:35.049 --> 01:17:36.590]  Forget the R and the D, it's almost irrelevant.
[01:17:37.546 --> 01:17:44.532]  Well, the battle is the good old boys above the law, who are basically untouchable, getting away with murder historically.
[01:17:44.852 --> 01:17:46.413]  That's how you always get tyranny.
[01:17:46.594 --> 01:17:59.204]  And if they're all covering each other's butts, and then they're covering the hind end of their minions, and their minions are covering their minions, and they're covering their minions, then that's how you get a culture of crime.
[01:17:59.785 --> 01:18:03.528]  And America is converting to a culture of elitist
[01:18:04.048 --> 01:18:08.252]  Criminality, and it's always there, but if you just give into it, it's game over.
[01:18:08.692 --> 01:18:08.853]  Right.
[01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:11.615]  I mean, look at the Michigan right now, Justin Amash.
[01:18:12.276 --> 01:18:13.817]  You know, the guy votes his conscience.
[01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:15.499]  He puts every vote on Facebook.
[01:18:15.539 --> 01:18:19.783]  He tells you why he did it, why he didn't do it, unlike Obama, who said he'd be transparent.
[01:18:19.803 --> 01:18:22.726]  It's been the most opaque administration in American history.
[01:18:23.246 --> 01:18:23.967]  But what happens?
[01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:27.409]  The easy answer would be, oh, the Democrats are going after him, right?
[01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:29.250]  No, the Republicans are going after him.
[01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.691]  Like, that's the problem.
[01:18:31.231 --> 01:18:36.254]  And I describe it in my book, this carousel of kind of insiders that are... They're not you.
[01:18:36.274 --> 01:18:37.675]  They're not people like you and me.
[01:18:37.695 --> 01:18:39.356]  They can't stand people.
[01:18:39.396 --> 01:18:40.416]  They probably really can't.
[01:18:40.556 --> 01:18:41.137]  You have an audience.
[01:18:41.437 --> 01:18:46.600]  But as my audience grows, they can't stand me either, because you're not speeding from the Trump.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.281]  You know, they're not going to buy you off.
[01:18:48.501 --> 01:18:49.502]  They're not going to buy me off.
[01:18:49.522 --> 01:18:50.743]  They're not going to buy Amash off.
[01:18:51.023 --> 01:18:53.365]  And it's like, it almost reminds me when I was a cop.
[01:18:53.726 --> 01:18:58.029]  You know, if you ever met a corrupt cop, they always want you to be corrupt with them.
[01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:02.012]  And there's very few of those, by the way, but the bad, bad seeds were the whole bunch.
[01:19:02.032 --> 01:19:05.295]  But, you know, they want you to be corrupt with them so that they don't feel so bad.
[01:19:05.575 --> 01:19:06.976]  Well, it's the same way in politics.
[01:19:06.996 --> 01:19:08.578]  It's like, well, this guy can't be bought off.
[01:19:08.658 --> 01:19:09.519]  Oh, we got to get rid of him.
[01:19:09.559 --> 01:19:10.619]  God forbid he has principles.
[01:19:10.659 --> 01:19:11.060]  He'll ruin it.
[01:19:12.161 --> 01:19:20.669]  Exactly, and then they'll try to go find something you did and exaggerated, a crooked toenail, whatever, or make stuff up to say you're corrupt.
[01:19:20.749 --> 01:19:27.356]  I've noticed the corrupt literally run around 24-7 saying I'm corrupt when I am totally not corrupt.
[01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:31.400]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm a perfect guy, but I'm almost like leave it to Beaver's dad.
[01:19:32.741 --> 01:19:39.526]  It's like these guys have been arrested for a felony and when you were 8 you got caught cheating on a spelling test and it's front page news.
[01:19:39.967 --> 01:19:40.607]  I know, I get it.
[01:19:40.627 --> 01:19:41.848]  They do it to me all the time.
[01:19:41.948 --> 01:19:46.211]  I mean, every single thing I do is, you know, some guy comes after me for it.
[01:19:46.251 --> 01:19:47.272]  So it's crazy.
[01:19:47.432 --> 01:19:49.914]  It's just they want you to be corrupt with them and that's the only way to do it.
[01:19:50.034 --> 01:19:54.479]  Well, it's like saying Rand Paul, in one of his speeches, quoted someone and didn't properly credit.
[01:19:54.499 --> 01:19:55.701]  He's a plagiarist!
[01:19:56.041 --> 01:20:00.566]  We're going to be right back with Dan Bongino to talk about his book and his run for Congress.
[01:20:00.907 --> 01:20:04.010]  Final segment with him straight ahead and then your phone calls coming up.
[01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:05.933]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:20:06.213 --> 01:20:08.135]  Check out his great site at Bongino.com.
[01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:13.634]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?

[01:20:15.496 --> 01:20:17.098]  Yes, the gift of clean water.
[01:20:17.459 --> 01:20:21.664]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[01:20:22.145 --> 01:20:25.730]  A Big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:29.493]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[01:20:29.773 --> 01:20:35.098]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[01:20:35.359 --> 01:20:39.082]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[01:20:39.422 --> 01:20:44.447]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.
[01:20:44.827 --> 01:20:51.168]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[01:22:09.255 --> 01:22:17.299]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:21.901]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[01:22:22.122 --> 01:22:24.203]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[01:22:24.543 --> 01:22:29.465]  After only three weeks on One World Way, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again.
[01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:31.186]  I feel energized and
[01:22:31.426 --> 01:22:33.448]  This is an amazing product.
[01:22:33.628 --> 01:22:39.952]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as glutathione.
[01:22:40.112 --> 01:22:42.794]  But due to toxicity and aging, it does not.
[01:22:42.854 --> 01:22:46.857]  Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?
[01:22:47.137 --> 01:22:54.042]  If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work better.
[01:22:54.342 --> 01:22:56.924]  Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.
[01:22:57.084 --> 01:22:58.706]  To order One World Way, call 888-
[01:22:59.326 --> 01:23:01.167]  988-3325.
[01:23:01.207 --> 01:23:03.087]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:03.127 --> 01:23:05.968]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:23:06.008 --> 01:23:08.569]  That's oneworld-w-h-e-y.com.
[01:23:08.849 --> 01:23:19.232]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:23:19.552 --> 01:23:21.393]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:23:21.593 --> 01:23:22.273]  Fluoride.
[01:23:22.473 --> 01:23:24.293]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:23:24.393 --> 01:23:30.695]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:23:30.975 --> 01:23:35.775]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:23:35.895 --> 01:23:42.016]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:44.377]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:23:44.637 --> 01:23:47.257]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:23:47.577 --> 01:23:50.958]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:23:51.078 --> 01:23:56.303]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:23:56.503 --> 01:24:01.308]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:24:01.608 --> 01:24:02.669]  I take it every day.
[01:24:02.809 --> 01:24:05.712]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:24:20.353 --> 01:24:24.598]  And again, thanks for joining us on this Monday edition of the World Wide Broadcast.
[01:24:24.618 --> 01:24:25.178]  We're live.
[01:24:25.198 --> 01:24:27.300]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:24:29.346 --> 01:24:30.767]  Dan Bongino is our guest.
[01:24:30.967 --> 01:24:38.250]  His book came in a few months ago, a really fantastic advanced copy, and I couldn't put it down, and it's a short book.
[01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:40.911]  I mean, not really short, but it's not super long.
[01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:42.652]  What is it, about 170-something pages?
[01:24:43.672 --> 01:24:44.973]  174 pages long.
[01:24:45.653 --> 01:24:47.494]  And, Dan, we've got six minutes left with you.
[01:24:47.774 --> 01:24:48.594]  Talk about the book.
[01:24:48.634 --> 01:24:50.235]  Tell us some of the stories that are in the book.
[01:24:50.275 --> 01:24:53.096]  I know you can't tell us all of them, but tell us about Life Inside the Bubble.
[01:24:53.646 --> 01:24:58.229]  Yeah, well first, before I get there, I just want to thank your audience, too, and you, Alex, you have an amazing audience.
[01:24:58.249 --> 01:25:01.472]  They are fiercely loyal to you and they've been unbelievably good to me.
[01:25:01.492 --> 01:25:05.194]  My social media, my website, everything's closed up on your show.
[01:25:05.215 --> 01:25:07.236]  So before I get there, thank you guys very much.
[01:25:07.716 --> 01:25:12.500]  And the book, yeah, it's kind of some behind-the-scenes stories, my time in the Secret Service.
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:21.967]  I talk about my time in Afghanistan in an active war zone, trying to secure the life of President Obama and how tough that was, getting caught in things like sandstorms and
[01:25:22.427 --> 01:25:29.490]  What it's like trying to secure an airfield with the threat of IDF, you know, indirect fire coming in, taking out Air Force One.
[01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:31.791]  The nice part about the book is there's no melodrama.
[01:25:31.831 --> 01:25:35.233]  I try to tell it from almost a self-deprecating perspective.
[01:25:35.253 --> 01:25:37.313]  There's nothing worse than hero worship.
[01:25:37.394 --> 01:25:39.674]  You know, we're all human beings and we all go through emotions.
[01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:42.316]  What I didn't want to do is write a comic book.
[01:25:42.356 --> 01:25:47.078]  I wanted you to read the book and understand what it's really like to be a Secret Service agent.
[01:25:47.118 --> 01:25:47.658]  The emotions,
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.769]  You know, the fear, the elation, the pain, you know, the crying family when you leave.
[01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:53.794]  And that's the first part of the book.
[01:25:54.034 --> 01:25:56.160]  And the second part of the book, I dig into Benghazi.
[01:25:57.077 --> 01:25:59.499]  Excuse me, Boston and Fast and Furious.
[01:25:59.639 --> 01:26:02.200]  And they're not long chapters, they're deliberately written very short.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:07.923]  And I did it to kind of make a case as a former federal investigator and criminal investigator.
[01:26:08.524 --> 01:26:11.946]  I wanted to almost write up an indictment in my perspective.
[01:26:12.026 --> 01:26:16.148]  Just give you the facts and you determine for yourself where you think everything went wrong.
[01:26:16.208 --> 01:26:21.572]  And I think if you read those three chapters, you'll have a very unique perspective, especially on Fast and Furious.
[01:26:21.792 --> 01:26:23.793]  I know I told the story the way no one else has.
[01:26:24.313 --> 01:26:29.781]  We've had a few really interesting articles written up on some major websites about that chapter specifically.
[01:26:29.861 --> 01:26:31.063]  So I love the book.
[01:26:31.123 --> 01:26:31.964]  It's gone really well.
[01:26:32.324 --> 01:26:38.353]  We were on the bestseller list on Amazon all week and I certainly appreciate you in the audience and everything you guys have done for me.
[01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:49.862]  You bet, and it's important to buy it at the bookstore as well, because I know from being a publisher and putting books out, you make almost no money with Amazon, the way they've got the market corner, but that's a whole other separate issue.
[01:26:49.882 --> 01:26:54.046]  We need to support people that are libertarian, constitutionalist, conservatives.
[01:26:54.586 --> 01:27:05.095]  The power structure has said, the Republican and Democratic leadership, they're scared of Rand Paul and Ted Cruz becoming a model for people like you to get into Congress, because then it's game over, we can go back to
[01:27:05.896 --> 01:27:06.577]  Basically, 1950 2.0.
[01:27:07.457 --> 01:27:14.923]  Like, keep the good things that have happened since 1950, but get rid of all the bad things and move forward with real Americana.
[01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:16.264]  I think that's the answer.
[01:27:16.544 --> 01:27:24.350]  Shifting gears with the economy, because last time you were on it, no secret service agents, you know, first and foremost know about counterfeiting and the economy and how things are working.
[01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:26.912]  For me, the illegal takings
[01:27:27.572 --> 01:27:35.095]  That's the big criminal operation, is shutting down his competition, letting corporations that give Obama money operate.
[01:27:35.556 --> 01:27:37.076]  For me, that's really racketeering.
[01:27:37.456 --> 01:27:40.338]  And I look at Obama, I see a criminal racketeer.
[01:27:40.858 --> 01:27:43.539]  And Ben Stein has now come out and said he's a criminal racketeer.
[01:27:43.899 --> 01:27:44.880]  I mean, call it like it is.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:48.001]  As a federal law enforcement guy, we're out of it now.
[01:27:48.021 --> 01:27:52.503]  I mean, I'm not a federal law enforcement person, but I've studied the law and criminology.
[01:27:53.003 --> 01:27:54.524]  Hands down, Obama is a gangster.
[01:27:56.252 --> 01:28:07.282]  I'll tell you this, if some of the activities they engaged in, they engaged in in the private sector, you would have, without a doubt, you would have a very solid case moving forward.
[01:28:07.342 --> 01:28:17.811]  Andy McCarthy wrote a piece about that, he called The Fraud of Obamacare, where the FCC, Alex, would have you and I in handcuffs doing a perp walk right now, if the stuff that happened with Obamacare.
[01:28:18.031 --> 01:28:20.153]  Now, you talked about the financial stuff.
[01:28:20.413 --> 01:28:22.314]  We haven't even dug into what the Feds do.
[01:28:22.334 --> 01:28:35.360]  I mean, that's a whole other show we could do on how the Fed is just destroying the asset accumulated over a lifetime by our seniors right now, and all doing it under the guise of helping us as they're kind of scratching your back, yet reaching into your pocket.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.261]  Again, with their favors to the banks.
[01:28:38.321 --> 01:28:41.682]  I mean, Dodd-Frank was nothing but a sop to big banks.
[01:28:41.943 --> 01:28:42.823]  The great irony being,
[01:28:43.203 --> 01:28:48.409]  The top 10 banks in the country, Alex, had 55% of the assets in the class before Dodd-Frank.
[01:28:48.429 --> 01:28:49.971]  So you're supposed to break all that up?
[01:28:50.351 --> 01:28:52.093]  So you figure, oh, they have much less right now.
[01:28:52.153 --> 01:28:52.814]  Dodd-Frank did that.
[01:28:52.954 --> 01:28:53.775]  Now they have 77%.
[01:28:53.835 --> 01:28:57.840]  So what a sop to these big... I mean, it's disgusting.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:58.080]  It's like
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:06.622]  Exactly, and they politically, the big banks, funded Gen21 to make us poor, so we're so poor we can't politically ever challenge them.
[01:29:06.642 --> 01:29:12.824]  And in closing, now the Financial Times is reporting that they're going to start charging you to keep money in a bank.
[01:29:13.184 --> 01:29:16.445]  That's how devalued they've done with the QE Unlimited.
[01:29:16.465 --> 01:29:17.465]  That's what you're getting at, right?
[01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:22.654]  Oh gosh, the QE, what a... Folks, I have to tell you, do you think that tax rates are a problem?
[01:29:23.054 --> 01:29:25.876]  I would almost accept a tax hike to get rid of QE.
[01:29:26.216 --> 01:29:30.740]  That's how desperate I want to get rid of QE because QE is the most devastating tax hike of all.
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:33.342]  Everything you have, everything is worth less.
[01:29:34.923 --> 01:29:39.687]  Dan, it's so refreshing to talk to somebody that understands economics, not some lawyer in Congress.
[01:29:40.328 --> 01:29:41.709]  You've got to get into Congress.
[01:29:43.090 --> 01:29:43.630]  Ten seconds.
[01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:45.231]  How's the congressional run going?
[01:29:45.912 --> 01:29:46.973]  Couldn't be going better, man.
[01:29:47.013 --> 01:29:48.214]  Thanks for your help, too.
[01:29:48.234 --> 01:29:48.974]  You guys have been great.
[01:29:49.115 --> 01:29:51.196]  Well, you've got to promise to come on once you're in Congress.
[01:29:51.436 --> 01:29:51.937]  You got it.
[01:29:52.057 --> 01:29:52.938]  You heard it on the air.
[01:29:53.238 --> 01:29:53.498]  All right.
[01:29:53.558 --> 01:29:54.159]  God bless you.
[01:29:54.199 --> 01:29:56.520]  Love, Congressman Bongino.
[01:29:56.561 --> 01:29:57.121]  Thank you very much.
[01:29:58.482 --> 01:29:59.063]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:59.103 --> 01:29:59.965]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.466 --> 01:30:02.050]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:05.697]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.216 --> 01:30:16.457]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:30:16.857 --> 01:30:19.238]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:30:19.338 --> 01:30:19.618]  The U.S.
[01:30:19.698 --> 01:30:23.819]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:26.499]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:30:26.879 --> 01:30:28.140]  They want that attack to come.
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:34.541]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:30:34.961 --> 01:30:37.423]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:30:37.623 --> 01:30:42.407]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:30:42.588 --> 01:30:50.014]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:30:50.334 --> 01:30:52.896]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:30:53.096 --> 01:30:55.737]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:30:56.177 --> 01:31:00.460]  Strategic Relocation the Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[01:31:09.574 --> 01:31:16.158]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
[01:31:16.459 --> 01:31:19.961]  A practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:31:20.261 --> 01:31:22.122]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:31:22.303 --> 01:31:23.003]  Fluoride!
[01:31:23.203 --> 01:31:24.784]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:25.124 --> 01:31:31.449]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:34.531]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[01:31:34.651 --> 01:31:36.492]  And the results are on record.
[01:31:36.612 --> 01:31:37.613]  Reports documented.
[01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:40.154]  We're good.
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:15.242]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:32:15.603 --> 01:32:24.067]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:32:24.487 --> 01:32:31.790]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:39.714]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:32:40.214 --> 01:32:43.597]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:32:44.177 --> 01:32:47.799]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:54.944]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.

[01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:06.753]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:24.504]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:25.405 --> 01:33:29.066]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:39.454]  By the way, I can call up most Republican, Libertarian-type Congress people and get them on the show.
[01:33:40.154 --> 01:33:42.515]  And they're not even really that popular of guests on the show.
[01:33:42.535 --> 01:33:46.638]  So I'm not trying to get people like that on for so-called ratings.
[01:33:46.678 --> 01:33:48.539]  You can get good information from them.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.122]  But Ron Paul's somebody I can pretty much get on whenever I want to.
[01:33:54.062 --> 01:34:03.588]  I can get Rand Paul on as well, but I happen to know it creates conniption fits for me to pull strings to get him on.
[01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:07.271]  And the last time Rand Paul was on, earlier this year,
[01:34:09.599 --> 01:34:11.200]  That'd be like January or something.
[01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:14.564]  He called us and said, why don't you ever try to get me on?
[01:34:14.604 --> 01:34:16.525]  I said, well, we've called a few times.
[01:34:16.545 --> 01:34:17.466]  They don't give you the message.
[01:34:18.427 --> 01:34:24.513]  And again, there's always camps in these politicians that are mainline Republicans working for them.
[01:34:24.773 --> 01:34:25.914]  We're like, don't go on that show.
[01:34:25.954 --> 01:34:26.855]  That discredits you.
[01:34:27.135 --> 01:34:35.143]  They still think that the mainstream media has power when the White House run MSNBC goes, look, Rand Paul goes on the Crazy Man Show.
[01:34:37.819 --> 01:34:40.900]  And so, I don't even attempt to get Rand Paul on.
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:52.262]  I was making the joke to Bongino, because I guarantee you, once he gets into Congress, hopefully, if he's not an election frog, because he's very popular and you see why, he's very well spoken, very smart, that there'll be people saying, don't do that.
[01:34:53.883 --> 01:34:58.744]  But what we need to do as a population is face the reality and get radical.
[01:34:58.764 --> 01:35:00.504]  Because we're facing radical tyranny.
[01:35:01.245 --> 01:35:02.285]  They're saying, we're radical?
[01:35:02.325 --> 01:35:04.085]  I'm not radical, I'm radically informed.
[01:35:05.386 --> 01:35:06.446]  I'm radically angry.
[01:35:07.847 --> 01:35:08.888]  I mean, we do real research.
[01:35:08.908 --> 01:35:10.029]  We know what we're talking about here.
[01:35:11.611 --> 01:35:17.838]  Most radio shows, even financial ones, they can't even have a financial discussion at the level that Bongino and I were just having.
[01:35:18.058 --> 01:35:19.800]  And that's just 101 stuff, folks.
[01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:25.186]  I study financial stuff probably 30 minutes a day.
[01:35:25.206 --> 01:35:26.428]  And you're like, well, that doesn't sound like much.
[01:35:26.468 --> 01:35:28.070]  That's more than most people do, folks.
[01:35:29.241 --> 01:35:35.526]  I mean, I spend a good 30 minutes, sometimes an hour, sometimes longer, really doing research, talking to all the experts.
[01:35:36.026 --> 01:35:39.509]  I'm getting educated here on air every day, talking to these people, too.
[01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:43.753]  I spend three, four hours a day on air, focused.
[01:35:45.799 --> 01:35:47.200]  And I really know how things work.
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.481]  And by the way, here's the big secret.
[01:35:50.301 --> 01:35:51.862]  It's not a secret how things work.
[01:35:52.423 --> 01:35:59.026]  The pundits get up on the mainline shows and don't tell you what's really going on because they would lose their jobs if they did.
[01:35:59.607 --> 01:36:03.509]  Dylan Radigan gets up and goes, foreign banks and offshore corporations are above the law.
[01:36:03.729 --> 01:36:05.270]  They're extracting us down to nothing.
[01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:06.991]  We're being made poor on purpose.
[01:36:07.211 --> 01:36:08.211]  It's a criminal plan.
[01:36:08.451 --> 01:36:09.132]  I'm sick of it.
[01:36:09.352 --> 01:36:10.212]  We have no future.
[01:36:10.393 --> 01:36:11.513]  Both parties are run by them.
[01:36:11.693 --> 01:36:12.194]  What are we going to do?
[01:36:12.254 --> 01:36:14.135]  And they're like, we're not renewing your contract.
[01:36:14.175 --> 01:36:14.575]  Get out of here.
[01:36:16.485 --> 01:36:17.325]  Rattigan got back with us.
[01:36:17.365 --> 01:36:18.246]  He's traveling overseas.
[01:36:18.266 --> 01:36:20.287]  He says when he gets back, in a few weeks he'll come on.
[01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:26.449]  I don't know why I ever thought to try to get him on, but the point is, is that we need everybody to act like Dylan Rattigan and get upset.
[01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:30.992]  When the reality is radical and sensational, you tell it.
[01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:35.514]  But the criminals are so radical, it's like, well, it's not polite to say what you're doing.
[01:36:37.234 --> 01:36:44.818]  It's kind of like you catch the neighbor doing something horrible, and it's so horrible what they're doing, the instinct is not to report it.
[01:36:45.618 --> 01:36:46.879]  Or not to do something about it.
[01:36:47.539 --> 01:36:49.800]  It's like the opposite of the snitch culture.
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:52.481]  The opposite of the snitch culture can also be bad as well.
[01:36:52.861 --> 01:37:01.385]  Because unless you go over there and beat your neighbor's brains out, you're not letting justice be served that you know that they're, say, molesting their children.
[01:37:02.306 --> 01:37:04.227]  Or cooking methamphetamine in their bathtub.
[01:37:05.405 --> 01:37:09.189]  And beating, you know, having pit bull fights in the backyard, or whatever.
[01:37:09.209 --> 01:37:21.280]  And there was some guy yesterday, I was on the hiking bike trail, and I see him walking, and he smiles at me with an aggressive look, and had a mean pit bull, and most pit bulls I know are nice, that came over and was actually menacing me.
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.641]  It looked like it had eyes like a person.
[01:37:22.681 --> 01:37:25.945]  It was like going, and I said, God help me not blow up.
[01:37:26.465 --> 01:37:29.446]  I'm just going to walk a little bit towards it as it's walking towards me.
[01:37:29.466 --> 01:37:31.107]  We're on this 20 foot wide path.
[01:37:31.667 --> 01:37:33.888]  And then the dog kind of gave me a look, looks so smart.
[01:37:34.368 --> 01:37:37.349]  I know pit bulls aren't supposed to be smart, but it's just a really weird looking dog.
[01:37:37.609 --> 01:37:40.330]  And then kind of like, and then turned away, but it came over to menace me.
[01:37:40.710 --> 01:37:44.531]  And then the guy just kind of looked at me and I wanted to beat his ass.
[01:37:45.972 --> 01:37:50.153]  Right there, because I mean, I've got a Chihuahua, two French Bulldogs in the lab.
[01:37:50.453 --> 01:37:51.774]  If you like mean dogs, that's great.
[01:37:51.814 --> 01:37:54.415]  Keep them on a leash and don't menace me with them.
[01:37:55.336 --> 01:38:02.043]  There was a woman, I've told this story, coming down the Heiken Bike Trail, like January 2nd of this year.
[01:38:02.083 --> 01:38:04.105]  The reason I know is a few days later I went on Piers Morgan.
[01:38:05.627 --> 01:38:16.958]  I think it was like two days before I left, maybe January 5th or something, the point was right before that, and I was jogging, I finished jogging, hiking back up this big hill out of the gully, and they had four German Shepherds.
[01:38:18.075 --> 01:38:19.195]  And I love dogs.
[01:38:19.315 --> 01:38:20.536]  And they came snarling.
[01:38:20.576 --> 01:38:22.256]  I heard snarling and barking up the hill.
[01:38:22.536 --> 01:38:23.457]  They'd done that to somebody else.
[01:38:23.477 --> 01:38:24.757]  And it was cold weather.
[01:38:24.777 --> 01:38:25.537]  They were in a good mood.
[01:38:26.218 --> 01:38:29.058]  And they came snarling and like running towards me.
[01:38:29.639 --> 01:38:32.499]  And if I would have run, these dogs would have chased me down and bitten me.
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.781]  So when they got within 10 feet, I went, get out of here!
[01:38:35.801 --> 01:38:36.761]  Get out of here!
[01:38:37.935 --> 01:38:39.596]  And this woman's husband bows up.
[01:38:39.616 --> 01:38:40.396]  He's a big guy.
[01:38:40.416 --> 01:38:43.318]  They're like a hundred yards, 60, 70 yards up above him.
[01:38:43.338 --> 01:38:46.640]  And they're like, Hey man, they're just, you know, they're just barking at you.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.321]  And I'm like, no, your dogs are startling.
[01:38:48.781 --> 01:38:49.842]  They're acting aggressive.
[01:38:49.882 --> 01:38:53.043]  If I would have run from them, like most people would have done, they were going to attack me.
[01:38:53.083 --> 01:38:54.084]  I go put them on a leash.
[01:38:55.445 --> 01:38:58.046]  And then the guy got in my face and I said, man, you're totally in the wrong.
[01:38:58.106 --> 01:38:59.267]  I said, go ahead and punch me.
[01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:02.271]  And I'm always going to bash his brains out, folks.
[01:39:02.751 --> 01:39:05.793]  And I mean, my whole thing is, I'm not looking for trouble, okay?
[01:39:06.533 --> 01:39:10.155]  But I am, it's like with government and all the rest of it, what is your problem?
[01:39:10.735 --> 01:39:16.938]  If I had a bunch of mean German shepherds, I wouldn't have them off a leash out in the middle of nowhere, messing with people.
[01:39:18.257 --> 01:39:22.802]  And I still see those people sometimes, and they like bug their eyes out and walk by with a cell phone.
[01:39:23.043 --> 01:39:25.085]  Oh God, I gotta get off, it's Alex Jones.
[01:39:25.105 --> 01:39:26.246]  And they're like, ugh.
[01:39:26.567 --> 01:39:28.829]  And it's just like, man, you're the one that menaced me.
[01:39:29.150 --> 01:39:36.398]  Your dogs ran up growling like they wanted to attack me, and then I got upset about it, and then I was a radical.
[01:39:36.798 --> 01:39:38.640]  And I was thinking of that again this morning.
[01:39:39.501 --> 01:39:40.342]  That's how they act.
[01:39:40.402 --> 01:39:45.907]  When their mean dog runs up to you, and you go, get out of here, and yell at it meanly to a predator.
[01:39:45.927 --> 01:39:48.129]  That's what you're supposed to do to a bear or a dog.
[01:39:50.631 --> 01:39:55.335]  And then, I'm supposed to let them menace me and get scared, and then they're on an ego trip.
[01:39:56.116 --> 01:39:59.479]  No, all that's going to happen is you're going to end up going into the hospital.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.182]  Or maybe you're really tough, and I am.
[01:40:03.222 --> 01:40:03.703]  Doesn't matter.
[01:40:03.923 --> 01:40:05.164]  Somebody's going to the hospital.
[01:40:08.424 --> 01:40:10.177]  But nine times out of ten, it's gonna be you!
[01:40:13.917 --> 01:40:15.358]  And I don't even know why I'm getting into that.
[01:40:15.378 --> 01:40:16.759]  I just start thinking about that dog.
[01:40:16.799 --> 01:40:17.900]  And it's the same thing with the government.
[01:40:18.061 --> 01:40:18.761]  You're pushing us.
[01:40:18.941 --> 01:40:19.642]  You're in our face.
[01:40:19.662 --> 01:40:20.362]  You're growling.
[01:40:20.382 --> 01:40:21.443]  You're wearing black uniforms.
[01:40:21.764 --> 01:40:24.406]  You're putting all the surveillance stuff in, calling it a battle grid.
[01:40:24.806 --> 01:40:27.568]  You're huge armored vehicles, helicopters, war.
[01:40:27.608 --> 01:40:28.649]  You've stolen all the money.
[01:40:29.150 --> 01:40:30.711]  And then you're just bowing up to me.
[01:40:30.751 --> 01:40:32.813]  And man, I'm not getting scared here, folks.
[01:40:33.773 --> 01:40:38.918]  I'm scared that I'll do something I shouldn't and then I'll be... I won't play it smart and defeat you.
[01:40:40.117 --> 01:40:43.780]  And that's why I'm going to use my cerebral cortex and I'm not going to be an animal about this.
[01:40:44.141 --> 01:40:56.572]  The problem is I've got a powerful political brain and an elegant brain, like all of you do as well, but I also have a big, mean, savage brain as well.
[01:40:57.633 --> 01:40:58.573]  And that's the problem.
[01:40:59.194 --> 01:41:00.395]  But it's also the solution.
[01:41:00.435 --> 01:41:02.377]  We have to get savage politically.
[01:41:03.305 --> 01:41:04.825]  We have to get aggressive.
[01:41:04.945 --> 01:41:08.386]  We have to get no holds barred, or we're going to be overrun, folks.
[01:41:08.727 --> 01:41:12.588]  If you run from a big mean dog, it's going to bite you on the butt, if you're lucky.
[01:41:12.908 --> 01:41:14.788]  Or worse, a pack of them, they're going to attack you.
[01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:18.149]  That's how people get killed, and I've told this story 20 times, I'll tell it again.
[01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:23.791]  I was reading some story about a woman killed in a park, I think it was in Canada, by coyotes a few years ago.
[01:41:24.793 --> 01:41:27.355]  And it was a pretty good-sized town.
[01:41:27.395 --> 01:41:29.656]  It was a park during the day and no one was there.
[01:41:30.176 --> 01:41:34.879]  And she, like the movies, saw a pack of coyotes, fell down and began crawling.
[01:41:34.899 --> 01:41:39.662]  I know because there was actually some witnesses drove by.
[01:41:39.682 --> 01:41:40.963]  They were too afraid to get involved.
[01:41:41.283 --> 01:41:43.124]  And so the dogs went, well that's prey.
[01:41:44.145 --> 01:41:45.126]  Even prey would run.
[01:41:45.186 --> 01:41:46.086]  She'd seen all the movies.
[01:41:46.106 --> 01:41:46.446]  She's supposed to...
[01:41:49.110 --> 01:41:51.932]  You know, crawl backwards from the coyote in fear.
[01:41:52.332 --> 01:41:58.317]  Whereas if a pack of coyotes ran by many times out where I live in the country, you'll see them run by and I mean, they're absolutely scared of you.
[01:41:59.807 --> 01:42:03.948]  But I've seen coyotes in a field with my mom and dad when I was a kid in really cold weather like this.
[01:42:03.988 --> 01:42:04.688]  We were on a ranch.
[01:42:05.108 --> 01:42:07.628]  We were actually on a ranch next door going to see a family cemetery.
[01:42:07.648 --> 01:42:11.269]  They let us on there to see a Jones and Brown family cemetery.
[01:42:11.889 --> 01:42:14.970]  And we were walking over to see a grave from like 1829 and stuff.
[01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:22.211]  And about eight big coyotes, all fluffed up in the cold, ran out about 50 yards away or out of the woods and looked at us.
[01:42:22.971 --> 01:42:25.171]  And then we looked back and my mom's like, how beautiful!
[01:42:25.432 --> 01:42:27.392]  But the fact that we weren't afraid, they then turned and ran.
[01:42:28.132 --> 01:42:29.833]  She's like, look, and then they turn around.
[01:42:30.814 --> 01:42:37.559]  But imagine an average trendy would just go and would fall down and go on their back.
[01:42:37.879 --> 01:42:39.261]  And the coyotes will come and kill you.
[01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:41.342]  Coyotes have never attacked people until now.
[01:42:41.682 --> 01:42:43.123]  There's a lot of cases of it now.
[01:42:43.664 --> 01:42:47.287]  And Americans act like that, like that woman falling down and
[01:42:49.449 --> 01:42:55.074]  It's like playing varmint tapes, how you hunt coyotes with the sound of squealing dying rabbits, bringing them in.
[01:42:55.394 --> 01:43:01.259]  And Americans think groveling to government, acting like sheep, acting like slaves is going to protect you.
[01:43:01.439 --> 01:43:05.603]  All it does is like go out in the woods at night and play the sounds of dying rabbits.
[01:43:05.924 --> 01:43:09.407]  You bring them in when you act like a baby rabbit that's had its back broken.
[01:43:10.896 --> 01:43:12.617]  You guys go to YouTube and find a varmint tape.
[01:43:12.737 --> 01:43:13.417]  I'm sure they've got them.
[01:43:13.537 --> 01:43:14.517]  People hear a varmint tape.
[01:43:14.917 --> 01:43:16.378]  The sound of squealing, dying animals.
[01:43:17.278 --> 01:43:18.178]  It's a horrible sound.
[01:43:19.018 --> 01:43:22.219]  But the point is, is that that's the new sound.
[01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:22.960]  Not of a sheep.
[01:43:29.312 --> 01:43:42.898]  It is the sound of the American people just squealing to the police and the police, if they weren't a predator, they start to behave like one because you're flopping around on the ground, acting completely guilty of something.
[01:43:43.538 --> 01:43:47.560]  And then it just enables this whole imperious, ridiculous attitude.
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:47.960]  And again, I
[01:43:51.314 --> 01:43:52.615]  I don't want to keep going off into it.
[01:43:53.436 --> 01:43:57.559]  It just shows the weird disconnect that's going on out there.
[01:43:57.599 --> 01:44:13.653]  Now, I want to open the phones up until the bottom of the next hour when we premiere the Vivian Kubrick interview that Josh and Rob Jacobson
[01:44:16.243 --> 01:44:17.884]  Put together just since last night.
[01:44:17.904 --> 01:44:23.249]  In fact, Josh stayed up all night, one of our great camera guys and editors, to get this together.
[01:44:23.729 --> 01:44:28.233]  And it could have been even better if he had more time, but it really turned out very, very good.
[01:44:28.513 --> 01:44:38.982]  We've got some clips from Stanley Kubrick films, and she worked on a lot of them, obviously, and I was really impressed talking to her, just how informed she was, and a lot of stuff she was teaching me, a lot of different angles on things.
[01:44:39.742 --> 01:44:41.103]  And so hopefully we'll get her in studio.
[01:44:41.124 --> 01:44:44.847]  She says she's gonna come down to Austin, and if she feels like it, come in studio.
[01:44:46.732 --> 01:45:11.219]  And just talk about the whole world that way because so much of it was off record the two nights that we hung out Myself and her and the crew And she was just telling me stuff about Herself and about Hollywood and about her father Stanley Kubrick and I was just like as a Stanley Kubrick uberfan I was just like oh my on cloud nine, man I was I mean, I don't know and she's right to trust me
[01:45:12.681 --> 01:45:14.243]  I actually instructed all my crew.
[01:45:14.263 --> 01:45:18.567]  I was like, any of that you heard, you sign on disclosures, keep your mouths shut about it.
[01:45:18.907 --> 01:45:20.708]  But she was kind of leaning in and whispering, telling me stuff.
[01:45:21.029 --> 01:45:22.430]  But it was pretty amazing.
[01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:25.132]  I mean, because I know a lot about Stanley Kubrick.
[01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:26.694]  Nobody knows hardly anything about Stanley Kubrick.
[01:45:27.824 --> 01:45:31.448]  And his daughter, who has done like one interview in 10 years, it was amazing.
[01:45:31.748 --> 01:45:33.671]  I know she's probably listening right now, Vivian.
[01:45:33.691 --> 01:45:34.552]  It was really great meeting you.
[01:45:34.572 --> 01:45:35.753]  You're just a magical person.
[01:45:36.534 --> 01:45:41.621]  And I do look forward to my wife and I taking you out to dinner or taking you around Austin or whatever.
[01:45:41.641 --> 01:45:45.285]  And she moved from California years ago to outside Dallas.
[01:45:46.829 --> 01:45:49.531]  I'm not going to even say why, but I just, wow, wow.
[01:45:49.931 --> 01:45:50.791]  So that's coming up.
[01:45:51.051 --> 01:45:53.473]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:45:53.493 --> 01:45:53.533]  800-259-9231.
[01:45:53.553 --> 01:45:54.853]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[01:45:54.873 --> 01:45:54.913]  800-259-9231.
[01:46:09.821 --> 01:46:16.187]  Again, the interview we had with her, she gets into the nature of the world and her view of things, which I found to be very interesting.
[01:46:16.988 --> 01:46:21.773]  We didn't get into all the Stanley Kubrick stuff, there's some of that, because I didn't push her to do an interview.
[01:46:23.129 --> 01:46:28.034]  I don't ever push celebrities or interesting people or famous artists or insiders.
[01:46:28.074 --> 01:46:29.435]  She's like the insider insider.
[01:46:30.216 --> 01:46:33.038]  I don't ever push them to come on the show or whatever.
[01:46:33.058 --> 01:46:34.219]  It's just people want to come on, they come on.
[01:46:34.259 --> 01:46:39.324]  And 90% of the celebrities always tell me incredible stuff, but then it's always off record.
[01:46:40.285 --> 01:46:48.753]  And I'll tell you, that's what's really cool about being on the very cutting edge of the alternative real media is that, is that
[01:46:50.495 --> 01:46:55.999]  All these really neat people end up sharing things with you and then you never burn your sources.
[01:46:58.902 --> 01:47:00.363]  And so just more and more people come to you.
[01:47:01.857 --> 01:47:06.759]  And when I say something like, this is, you know, someone told me off-record, but here's what they said, I'm not saying who they are.
[01:47:07.219 --> 01:47:15.222]  Off-record, when somebody tells you this is off-record, you can say this, but you can't see where it came from, that's the person's off-record, the source is off-record.
[01:47:15.522 --> 01:47:16.903]  But then I can tell you what they said.
[01:47:17.603 --> 01:47:23.325]  But then there's sometimes I'm told stuff that's completely off-record, period, and then I can't even tell you what I know.
[01:47:23.845 --> 01:47:31.048]  Or a lot of times you get a high-level source, intel, and then you confirm it through another source, and then a third source, and you go, okay,
[01:47:32.984 --> 01:47:36.105]  All right, Saudi Arabia is already getting nuclear weapons and so is Iran.
[01:47:36.205 --> 01:47:40.947]  Iran's already got weapons, multiple weapons, and they're just trying to get delivery systems.
[01:47:41.527 --> 01:47:45.089]  And so all this talk about the centrifuges, it doesn't matter that they really can't make bombs.
[01:47:45.469 --> 01:47:52.051]  It's an excuse with bunker busters to try to figure out where the nukes are to take the nukes out.
[01:47:53.792 --> 01:47:55.873]  Well, they're not technically nukes, they're atomic.
[01:47:58.877 --> 01:48:02.838]  Then do you go on air and tell people about something like that?
[01:48:03.778 --> 01:48:07.319]  Because it's dangerous to get that type of information.
[01:48:08.139 --> 01:48:11.219]  You know, Stanley Kubrick on record got a lot of key info for his films.
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:16.860]  And I'm not going to even say anymore, because that wasn't off record.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:22.241]  But I'm not going to say anything she told me that wasn't on camera because and again, I wasn't going to interview her is the point.
[01:48:22.842 --> 01:48:24.722]  And then she just came and stepped in on camera.
[01:48:26.053 --> 01:48:30.495]  She was there and I was talking to the crowd and then there she is again on that Friday, that final day.
[01:48:30.515 --> 01:48:32.956]  I was like, boom, she talked to us.
[01:48:32.976 --> 01:48:39.139]  So that's coming up and we're going to take your phone calls when we come back in the next segment.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:44.902]  And then before I go to her, I've got to get to inside a Twitter robot factory.
[01:48:45.202 --> 01:48:50.805]  Fake activity often bought for publicity purposes, influence trending topics.
[01:48:50.825 --> 01:48:50.965]  Yeah.
[01:48:54.218 --> 01:48:57.911]  Obama, first it was 76% of his Twitter followers were fake, then it was 91%.
[01:48:58.132 --> 01:49:00.179]  Folks, they're basically all fake.
[01:49:01.073 --> 01:49:10.397]  Jay-Z, what's her name, Jay-Z, all those people, all of them, it's all fake, it's all fake.
[01:49:10.757 --> 01:49:19.681]  But then when somebody has 15 million Twitter followers, it creates an effect with the sheeple, they then believe that that's really popular and it becomes popular.
[01:49:20.182 --> 01:49:27.505]  And by putting out fake popular ideas, you then actually create the fraud that that then becomes the cultural norm.
[01:49:28.706 --> 01:49:30.247]  And that is hijacking culture.
[01:49:31.007 --> 01:49:32.068]  People really want freedom.
[01:49:32.088 --> 01:49:36.551]  People really want women are women, men are men, you know, all that stuff.
[01:49:36.951 --> 01:49:40.353]  Mom and apple pie, baseball, you know, Wild West.
[01:49:40.453 --> 01:49:41.734]  That's what people really like.
[01:49:41.774 --> 01:49:45.436]  They don't like Nanny State and all this, but they sell the fake cultures.
[01:49:45.476 --> 01:49:46.237]  They sell it all.
[01:49:47.197 --> 01:49:53.502]  And then they suppress, because we happen to have put monitoring systems on servers and on YouTube and things.
[01:49:54.403 --> 01:49:59.547]  And we've confirmed that the activity on our videos is way more than even what they say.
[01:49:59.567 --> 01:50:00.648]  And it's still gargantuan.
[01:50:01.369 --> 01:50:07.254]  And so there's just all sorts of gaming and scamming and manipulation that's going on out there.
[01:50:08.175 --> 01:50:09.195]  And just be aware of that.
[01:50:09.296 --> 01:50:10.877]  And I'm going to talk more about it in the next hour.
[01:50:11.417 --> 01:50:11.818]  Briefly,
[01:50:13.048 --> 01:50:17.334]  I'm rolling out a whole new incredible product line and I haven't even done a promo video or detailed it.
[01:50:17.414 --> 01:50:18.995]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:50:19.016 --> 01:50:20.958]  Your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[01:50:21.018 --> 01:50:26.885]  And check out the two new additions to the InfoWars Life brand of products and line of products.
[01:50:27.606 --> 01:50:28.947]  This is the best coffee I found.
[01:50:30.132 --> 01:50:35.315]  The very same beans are upwards of twice as much with the other places I could find them.
[01:50:35.835 --> 01:50:41.278]  I ended up finding a source directly to the Chiapas people, and this is the ultimate fair trade.
[01:50:41.298 --> 01:50:44.380]  I mean, most of the cost was directly to them.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.221]  Then we import it into Colorado.
[01:50:46.241 --> 01:50:47.422]  It's roasted by hand there.
[01:50:47.442 --> 01:50:48.823]  We have photos of that going on.
[01:50:49.503 --> 01:50:51.045]  I'm going to send a camera crew there to show people.
[01:50:51.065 --> 01:50:55.971]  This is absolutely hand-roasted in America and it's very fair price.
[01:50:55.991 --> 01:51:00.997]  $19 for the mushroom immune support blend.
[01:51:01.017 --> 01:51:05.001]  $17 for the Patriot Arabica Shade Grown Mountain Blend.
[01:51:05.061 --> 01:51:06.163]  It's just amazing.
[01:51:06.223 --> 01:51:07.624]  It's the best coffee out there in my view.
[01:51:10.027 --> 01:51:15.131]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:51:15.491 --> 01:51:23.976]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:31.682]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.

[01:54:06.677 --> 01:54:07.558]  Others don't.
[01:54:22.976 --> 01:54:24.137]  We'll ride again.
[01:54:26.039 --> 01:54:28.001]  We're back live.
[01:54:29.242 --> 01:54:30.463]  Going to your phone calls now.
[01:54:31.564 --> 01:54:34.668]  Before we get to the Kubrick interview, the Kubrick exclusive,
[01:54:37.045 --> 01:54:38.466]  It really is a very rare interview, folks.
[01:54:38.486 --> 01:54:39.527]  That's why I'm excited about it.
[01:54:40.828 --> 01:54:48.935]  Comet ISON is supposedly going to serve up an incredibly spectacular light show.
[01:54:48.975 --> 01:54:50.716]  That's what NASA is saying.
[01:54:50.756 --> 01:54:53.999]  This is in an article in the Washington Post.
[01:54:54.419 --> 01:54:57.682]  French writers protest over the new tax.
[01:54:59.764 --> 01:55:03.326]  Get ready for it over here inside the Twitter Robot Factory.
[01:55:03.366 --> 01:55:04.586]  That's just some of what I'm going to be covering.
[01:55:04.606 --> 01:55:06.107]  There's a bunch of stuff I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:55:06.467 --> 01:55:08.048]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:55:08.508 --> 01:55:09.949]  Mike in Texas, thanks for calling.
[01:55:09.989 --> 01:55:10.529]  You're on the air.
[01:55:10.549 --> 01:55:13.030]  Hey Alex, this is Mike.
[01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:17.112]  I met you Wednesday night at the Fed Rally.
[01:55:17.432 --> 01:55:20.954]  That's right, in the private Federal Reserve Rally to kick off the JFK coverage.
[01:55:20.994 --> 01:55:21.554]  Thank you for coming.
[01:55:22.714 --> 01:55:23.054]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:23.094 --> 01:55:25.435]  As a matter of fact, I gave you my business card when I was leaving.
[01:55:25.455 --> 01:55:29.036]  I told you I was a project manager in the telecom business.
[01:55:29.116 --> 01:55:30.737]  And you said, yeah, oh, I could use some help.
[01:55:30.797 --> 01:55:32.038]  So feel free, man.
[01:55:32.078 --> 01:55:32.398]  Call me.
[01:55:32.718 --> 01:55:34.318]  You know, I've got that card somewhere.
[01:55:34.338 --> 01:55:35.539]  I actually took that home with me.
[01:55:35.559 --> 01:55:39.700]  And we are trying to hire some more folks to help me manage everything right now.
[01:55:40.121 --> 01:55:40.741]  InfoWars.
[01:55:40.781 --> 01:55:44.962]  We've really cleaned out some of the dead weight and really got a great team here now.
[01:55:45.002 --> 01:55:45.983]  So we're ready to go to the next level.
[01:55:47.233 --> 01:55:54.800]  Yeah, it was funny when McBreen pulled up as the getaway driver when you were leaving.
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.021]  I was busting your horns.
[01:55:56.081 --> 01:55:57.763]  I was like, hey, you almost lost your girlfriend.
[01:55:57.783 --> 01:55:59.865]  He looked at me like, well, I don't have a girlfriend.
[01:56:00.506 --> 01:56:02.567]  And I said, oh, no, that's your bullhorn.
[01:56:02.587 --> 01:56:03.508]  That's your girlfriend.
[01:56:03.668 --> 01:56:04.549]  He laughed a little bit.
[01:56:04.569 --> 01:56:05.770]  And then you took off and left.
[01:56:05.831 --> 01:56:08.373]  But a couple of things.
[01:56:09.119 --> 01:56:17.963]  Being in the telecommunications industry, a lot of the things that you talk about, a lot of the information that you have is right on as far as the Telecommunications Act.
[01:56:18.743 --> 01:56:22.205]  But there were a lot of things that were implemented before that.
[01:56:22.225 --> 01:56:23.465]  Oh, I know, I know.
[01:56:23.806 --> 01:56:26.947]  I just started researching it from what I was told by engineers then.
[01:56:27.067 --> 01:56:28.428]  I know that I'm not an engineer.
[01:56:28.928 --> 01:56:31.689]  I just know a thimble amount, but know it's all on record.
[01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:32.549]  That's what's frustrating.
[01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:34.090]  Sure.
[01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:35.811]  Well, you should look up an acronym.
[01:56:35.851 --> 01:56:37.692]  It's C-A-L-E-A.
[01:56:39.304 --> 01:56:43.147]  So this was an act that Bill Clinton put in in 94.
[01:56:43.227 --> 01:56:45.088]  Yeah, that's for all the metadata and stuff.
[01:56:45.108 --> 01:56:47.109]  That's what our insiders have told me to look into.
[01:56:48.370 --> 01:56:54.014]  Yeah, it stands for Communications Access for Law Enforcement Act.
[01:56:54.694 --> 01:57:04.180]  So what that did, and I was one of the engineers and a lot of the project management, you know, implementation on these things for Verizon in New York City downtown.
[01:57:05.061 --> 01:57:08.423]  I'm saying, okay, so in other words, we've got these companies
[01:57:09.341 --> 01:57:19.450]  Vendors that are based in Tel Aviv, Israel, who, when we need tech support on this, they can just log in via IP to this system.
[01:57:20.251 --> 01:57:21.052]  You know, that's right.
[01:57:21.092 --> 01:57:31.321]  In fact, Kalia, I know on the phone system, it's actually an Israeli company runs it, and that points out that Israel, talk about the ultimate hack, has back doors into the phone systems.
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:42.083]  Yeah, and when I would be talking to these engineers from the vendors who were giving us product training on this stuff, I just started calling it the MI protocol instead of IP.
[01:57:42.103 --> 01:57:50.106]  I said, well, this is basically the internet is the military-industrial complex, this computer network and internet protocol.
[01:57:50.826 --> 01:57:53.107]  Is the way for them to hack into everything.
[01:57:53.387 --> 01:57:54.368]  No, no, that's on record.
[01:57:54.408 --> 01:57:57.689]  That's why I finally wired and I'm sure they got it from me because that's what I've said.
[01:57:57.709 --> 01:58:00.270]  They have weaponized the web from the beginning.
[01:58:00.710 --> 01:58:03.211]  It is the electronic in slow motion.
[01:58:03.251 --> 01:58:10.654]  If you can see it sped up in a time lapse, it's an electronic skin growing into everything, monitoring everything.
[01:58:10.754 --> 01:58:12.795]  We're already interface with it with iPads.
[01:58:13.115 --> 01:58:17.039]  Then it goes to glasses, then it goes to a brain port, then it goes to our brain.
[01:58:17.139 --> 01:58:25.348]  Imagine it like an alien jumping out of the egg onto our face, and then literally taking us over, and that's the official Pentagon plan.
[01:58:25.628 --> 01:58:30.193]  Imagine in slow motion, you know, a computer that would run a wristwatch today the size of a giant building.
[01:58:30.413 --> 01:58:34.398]  Then it's smaller, then it's, you know, something a thousand times stronger in your hand, an iPhone.
[01:58:34.618 --> 01:58:35.599]  Now you're always looking at it.
[01:58:35.839 --> 01:58:36.800]  Now it's sunglasses.
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:38.302]  Now it's contacts.
[01:58:38.522 --> 01:58:39.163]  Then it's a chip.
[01:58:39.223 --> 01:58:39.844]  Then it's a port.
[01:58:40.044 --> 01:58:40.945]  Then it's your whole brain.
[01:58:41.065 --> 01:58:41.966]  Then it's your whole body.
[01:58:42.207 --> 01:58:42.427]  Zip.
[01:58:42.527 --> 01:58:42.907]  Gone.
[01:58:42.927 --> 01:58:46.992]  Because once you're wire-headed, they just hit one button and kill everybody.
[01:58:47.012 --> 01:58:47.713]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:50.196 --> 01:58:51.517]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:51.578 --> 01:58:54.921]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.694 --> 01:59:02.775]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:59:03.175 --> 01:59:08.876]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:59:09.116 --> 01:59:15.497]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:59:15.697 --> 01:59:21.118]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:59:21.378 --> 01:59:25.039]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:59:25.219 --> 01:59:28.782]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:59:29.022 --> 01:59:33.405]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:59:33.626 --> 01:59:35.947]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:59:36.127 --> 01:59:38.309]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen.
[01:59:38.429 --> 01:59:39.670]  The book that woke me up.
[01:59:39.970 --> 01:59:44.274]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:59:44.414 --> 01:59:47.056]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:59:47.356 --> 01:59:53.880]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:58.903]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[02:00:02.565 --> 02:00:04.506]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.966 --> 02:00:07.788]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:14.335 --> 02:00:18.519]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:19.981]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.742 --> 02:00:21.643]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.303 --> 02:00:25.947]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.488 --> 02:00:30.552]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:46.858 --> 02:00:49.580]  Yeah, this country is completely taken over.
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:51.061]  It's all a technological plan.
[02:00:51.081 --> 02:00:56.144]  Again, I've talked about this for a decade since I've read the magazine sitting in a restaurant.
[02:00:56.284 --> 02:01:03.028]  It was by the bar while I was picking up food that I was reading MIT magazine and just said it's a technological skin.
[02:01:03.048 --> 02:01:04.108]  It'll track everything you do.
[02:01:04.128 --> 02:01:06.310]  It's gonna absorb humanity and that's our plan.
[02:01:07.694 --> 02:01:09.575]  And then I go on the radio and talk about it.
[02:01:09.595 --> 02:01:11.235]  The New York Times comes out and says I'm insane.
[02:01:11.295 --> 02:01:14.437]  I mean, I quote Ray Kurzweil and they say, I said that.
[02:01:14.477 --> 02:01:20.179]  And then it's like when they're saying it and they're saying it's a good idea to get rid of humanity and have us merge with machines, those that are left.
[02:01:20.599 --> 02:01:21.599]  It's like, oh, how smart.
[02:01:21.639 --> 02:01:22.239]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:01:22.259 --> 02:01:24.100]  And I go, hey, maybe we should debate this.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:24.700]  Shut up.
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:25.921]  It doesn't exist, you nutball.
[02:01:26.121 --> 02:01:27.001]  Don't listen to him, kids.
[02:01:27.021 --> 02:01:27.581]  He's crazy.
[02:01:28.182 --> 02:01:30.803]  And I'm just sitting here living in a science fiction movie.
[02:01:31.983 --> 02:01:35.504]  And for one thing's for sure, we got front row seats for the battle for humanity.
[02:01:35.544 --> 02:01:36.745]  I don't know how anybody could be bored.
[02:01:37.677 --> 02:01:42.341]  And I guess that's why I'm gonna, you know, I had kids, and I'm gonna go on livin' and lovin'.
[02:01:42.381 --> 02:01:45.023]  If you ain't lovin', you ain't livin', to quote George Strait.
[02:01:45.043 --> 02:01:47.805]  Probably remind me, he's comin' to town.
[02:01:47.865 --> 02:01:48.906]  You guys remind me to get tickets.
[02:01:49.547 --> 02:01:52.449]  Because remember, you said he hadn't come to town in forever, but now he is.
[02:01:52.529 --> 02:01:53.810]  I wanna go see George Strait again.
[02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:54.791]  I hadn't seen him since I was a kid.
[02:01:54.811 --> 02:01:56.332]  I mean, teenager.
[02:01:56.772 --> 02:01:57.473]  Saw him in Dallas.
[02:01:58.093 --> 02:02:03.358]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kyle in Nebraska.
[02:02:03.438 --> 02:02:04.298]  Kyle, you're on the air.
[02:02:04.338 --> 02:02:04.879]  Thanks for holding.
[02:02:06.263 --> 02:02:12.587]  God bless the beating heart of liberty and freedom, and God bless the truth and reality you constantly express on the show every day and your whole team.
[02:02:13.007 --> 02:02:13.847]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[02:02:13.867 --> 02:02:15.488]  I wanted to talk about... Thank you.
[02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:19.811]  I wanted to talk about the... You guys came out with a couple articles from Seattle.
[02:02:19.891 --> 02:02:20.631]  One was in Israel.
[02:02:20.651 --> 02:02:27.555]  These were dating back a couple months, maybe six, eight months back, talking about taking the fluoride out of the water and how they got something passed in just their town.
[02:02:27.975 --> 02:02:32.278]  How do we get a candidate, whether it be Democrat or Republican, to back
[02:02:32.847 --> 02:02:36.450]  Taking the fluoride out of the water and taking the GMOs out of the water.
[02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:46.237]  Well, the best thing to do is to point out that the FDA under lawsuits and under 90 plus percent, I want to say 99, but it was almost all of their toxicologists
[02:02:47.125 --> 02:02:55.447]  Medical doctors, scientists, toxicologists that worked for the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency.
[02:02:56.227 --> 02:03:01.608]  About 12 years ago they did it and then again about a year and a half ago or two years ago it was in mainstream news.
[02:03:02.788 --> 02:03:05.929]  They sent registered briefs to the boss together.
[02:03:05.989 --> 02:03:15.331]  Imagine the organizational skill of those federal employees really caring to get everyone in the country, almost all of them, so they couldn't fire them all.
[02:03:15.391 --> 02:03:15.871]  You understand?
[02:03:16.892 --> 02:03:23.754]  You didn't bring the brief with the cancer studies and the diabetes studies and the brain damage studies from fluoride and the lowered IQ studies.
[02:03:24.855 --> 02:03:35.918]  And so the Fed, the globalists that run our government, responded by saying, okay, we say 1.3 parts per million or 1.6.
[02:03:36.098 --> 02:03:40.700]  You got to lower that to, you know, not one point.
[02:03:41.650 --> 02:03:45.031]  Six, but you've got to lower it down to 0.7 parts per million.
[02:03:45.691 --> 02:03:49.792]  And we want it phased out in the next two years, out of pesticides, it's bioaccumulating.
[02:03:50.312 --> 02:03:58.995]  And we want to put out recommendations that all these powdered egg companies and the rest of it, that can have hundreds of parts per million.
[02:03:59.015 --> 02:04:01.355]  I mean, that's why I've eaten powdered eggs before and I started vomiting.
[02:04:01.395 --> 02:04:03.376]  I mean, it's just like, it's a roach poison.
[02:04:04.256 --> 02:04:05.856]  And they're just putting it in there.
[02:04:05.956 --> 02:04:08.237]  And yeah, it's a great preservative because nothing can get into it.
[02:04:08.766 --> 02:04:09.847]  You put it in bread, anything.
[02:04:09.887 --> 02:04:10.788]  Weevils aren't going to eat it.
[02:04:10.828 --> 02:04:15.151]  That's why McDonald's hamburgers, you can put them under glass, five years later they look fine.
[02:04:15.972 --> 02:04:17.053]  Mold won't even grow on them.
[02:04:17.113 --> 02:04:17.914]  It's a chemical weapon.
[02:04:19.535 --> 02:04:21.277]  It's just incredible.
[02:04:21.637 --> 02:04:25.420]  So to answer your question, you sue them.
[02:04:25.921 --> 02:04:33.928]  You put them on notice, and you get a local toxicologist or something to go with you, and you say, hey, the EPA and FDA should reduce the amount of this in the water.
[02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:38.135]  And you get their study that, oh, you're still at 1.6 or 1.3.
[02:04:38.796 --> 02:04:43.003]  You make them reduce it and you say, well, why don't we just take it completely out instead of force medicating?
[02:04:43.023 --> 02:04:45.607]  And if they don't, you sue them for force medicating.
[02:04:46.048 --> 02:04:46.569]  How's that sound?
[02:04:48.596 --> 02:04:55.759]  Well, if we have all those other countries that are already taking you out, what does it take to have a candidate that's trying to get elected to mention all these things?
[02:04:55.799 --> 02:04:57.099]  I'll tell you what, I'm going to come back to you.
[02:04:57.119 --> 02:04:58.120]  This is so important, Kyle.
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:04:59.640]  We're going to talk about strategies on this.
[02:05:00.281 --> 02:05:01.361]  This is really important.
[02:05:01.421 --> 02:05:04.862]  And then we're going to go to Kathy, Chris, Alan, and others.
[02:05:04.962 --> 02:05:07.043]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:07.463 --> 02:05:08.764]  Follow us on Twitter, RealAlexJones.
[02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:11.150]  I had tried everything.
[02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:13.352]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:05:13.572 --> 02:05:16.254]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:05:16.694 --> 02:05:21.177]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[02:05:21.538 --> 02:05:27.922]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:05:28.383 --> 02:05:38.831]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:39.591 --> 02:05:43.712]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:05:44.052 --> 02:05:50.093]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:50.313 --> 02:05:51.473]  Now that's results.
[02:05:51.893 --> 02:05:58.294]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[02:05:58.674 --> 02:06:04.295]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[02:06:04.395 --> 02:06:06.636]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[02:06:06.936 --> 02:06:08.556]  Infowarsteam.com.
[02:06:09.597 --> 02:06:15.204]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:06:15.405 --> 02:06:22.634]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:06:22.794 --> 02:06:25.958]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:06:26.118 --> 02:06:27.919]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:06:28.159 --> 02:06:32.742]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:06:32.822 --> 02:06:35.564]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:06:35.724 --> 02:06:41.508]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:06:41.688 --> 02:06:45.150]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:50.413]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[02:06:50.613 --> 02:06:53.555]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:53.835 --> 02:06:59.703]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[02:06:59.803 --> 02:07:01.806]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[02:07:01.966 --> 02:07:07.414]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:07:10.362 --> 02:07:15.464]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:07:15.824 --> 02:07:24.287]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:07:24.707 --> 02:07:32.010]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:07:32.530 --> 02:07:39.933]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[02:07:40.433 --> 02:07:43.835]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[02:07:44.395 --> 02:07:48.038]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[02:07:48.578 --> 02:07:55.182]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[02:07:55.742 --> 02:08:02.466]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front.
[02:08:02.946 --> 02:08:06.989]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[02:08:19.452 --> 02:08:24.059]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:25.682]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:27.418]  And to get your soul, the power structure has to attack your body and dumb it down with poisons, fluoride, GMOs, all on record, shredding the body, shredding the mind, so that you're so weakened, you acquiesce to what's happening.
[02:09:27.438 --> 02:09:28.979]  We have a caller we're going back to in a moment.
[02:09:29.519 --> 02:09:36.122]  Kyle in Nebraska asked me a really important question, and this is the type of stuff we need to be doing on InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:09:37.862 --> 02:09:58.576]  I need, at least once a week, to do a particular subject on what I believe the best battle plan is, like Alex Jones Battle Plan Fluoride, Alex Jones Battle Plan Electronic Voting Machines, Alex Jones Battle Plan Second Amendment, Alex Jones Battle Plan Borders National Sovereignty, Alex Jones Battle Plan.
[02:09:59.296 --> 02:10:01.598]  It doesn't mean I have all the answers, but, you know,
[02:10:02.778 --> 02:10:07.802]  You get other people's perspectives on it as well, but people are always asking what I think, so I'll be glad to tell you.
[02:10:10.543 --> 02:10:11.884]  How would I get fluoride out?
[02:10:11.924 --> 02:10:20.110]  Well, in a lot of cities, you've got such an arrogant establishment, they know that if the fluoride gets taken out, that it's the beginning of the end.
[02:10:20.150 --> 02:10:21.571]  It's like the Kennedy assassination.
[02:10:21.991 --> 02:10:27.515]  If they ever admit that criminal elements killed Kennedy, well then that unravels everything like a string in a sweater.
[02:10:28.868 --> 02:10:30.128]  So they'll do anything to prop that up.
[02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:35.190]  And hydrofluorosilicic acid, you do need some calcium fluoride.
[02:10:35.230 --> 02:10:36.171]  It's good for you.
[02:10:36.691 --> 02:10:37.992]  You need small amounts of it.
[02:10:38.072 --> 02:10:39.332]  It's in all vegetables.
[02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:40.873]  It's in a lot of meat.
[02:10:41.133 --> 02:10:42.133]  Very small amounts.
[02:10:42.673 --> 02:10:44.034]  Trace element that you need.
[02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:50.354]  Just like you need trace amounts of bioavailable arsenic, the type that's in an apple.
[02:10:50.374 --> 02:10:51.155]  It's actually good for you.
[02:10:51.475 --> 02:10:52.676]  Major studies on that, look it up.
[02:10:53.116 --> 02:11:00.682]  But it's bound and it's a very small amount and it helps activate other things in the body is what scientists, medical doctors, nutritionists have basically said.
[02:11:01.063 --> 02:11:02.984]  I'm not a scientist or medical doctor or nutritionist.
[02:11:03.284 --> 02:11:06.287]  I'm going off what is known science in the elites.
[02:11:07.708 --> 02:11:13.873]  Like if I wanted to live longer, I would eat a near starvation diet of super high nutrient with a lot of trace poisons in it.
[02:11:16.921 --> 02:11:20.003]  And I would live probably 30% longer, that's on record.
[02:11:20.043 --> 02:11:28.929]  You eat plenty, you exercise a lot, you're great looking, you're super happy, but a little bit plump and stuff, you're gonna, you know, die when you're 75.
[02:11:29.529 --> 02:11:39.936]  That's why there's trees out in California that are multi-thousands of years old, and their brethren down in the valley, they get plenty of water and everything, live a couple hundred years, they live thousands.
[02:11:43.644 --> 02:11:49.649]  Up on the windswept crags with not enough water, barely surviving, they live a lot longer.
[02:11:49.689 --> 02:11:50.810]  They've got studies on rats.
[02:11:51.131 --> 02:11:53.833]  They can make them live three times as longer on their starvation diet.
[02:11:54.974 --> 02:12:00.579]  They've got studies on worms where they can make them live as much as 10 times longer sitting different types of worms.
[02:12:00.879 --> 02:12:04.322]  You can look that up and it deals with the DNA strands and the rest of it.
[02:12:04.362 --> 02:12:08.906]  But the point here is you're like, what's the deal with fluoride?
[02:12:10.583 --> 02:12:15.145]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is electrified.
[02:12:15.165 --> 02:12:36.455]  They've manipulated its structure where it's super highly active, bouncing around in your body, frying everything, and then other trace drugs, the fluoride is there, the hydrofluorosilicic acid, that's what it really is, the fluorine family, the electrified fluorine, the hydrofluorosilicic acid,
[02:12:38.231 --> 02:12:42.793]  is in there to supercharge all the other crap they're putting in the food and the water.
[02:12:43.313 --> 02:12:43.853]  The drugs.
[02:12:44.813 --> 02:12:52.496]  It is the ultimate... In fact, the scientists and doctors I've talked to say they know of no adjuvant that's better than hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:12:54.116 --> 02:13:00.358]  My dad took biology at UT and that's all they talked about was hydrofluorosilicic acid, what an incredible adjuvant it is.
[02:13:00.378 --> 02:13:03.619]  That's why some drugs have hydrofluorosilicic acid in them.
[02:13:03.899 --> 02:13:05.220]  In fact, all the Prozac family
[02:13:07.130 --> 02:13:09.438]  To then activate the other stuff that's in there.
[02:13:09.799 --> 02:13:11.525]  So, it's the base drug.
[02:13:13.032 --> 02:13:18.796]  that they put in the water to then activate for very small amounts of other stuff will absolutely jack you.
[02:13:19.497 --> 02:13:24.841]  See, that's why, and I'm not doing a plug here, but I guess I might as well, because it's time to take it, I didn't take it this morning, I forgot.
[02:13:25.181 --> 02:13:39.873]  Survival Shield, the nascent iodine, the nascent iodine is also electrically souped up and charged, and this particular patented type, I'm told by Dr. Grip and my dad's at the National Academy of Science, I've had him check into it before I even, you know, got into it,
[02:13:41.318 --> 02:13:44.301]  This is most nascent, we believe.
[02:13:44.321 --> 02:13:47.284]  We've had nuclear reactor tests, you name it.
[02:13:47.304 --> 02:13:50.928]  It's very hard to figure all this out, but we've got a big paper on it coming out soon.
[02:13:52.179 --> 02:13:54.802]  A bunch of scientists and lawyers, you name it.
[02:13:55.163 --> 02:13:56.945]  This is so proprietary, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:57.445 --> 02:14:10.100]  This particular survival shield, we believe, is a very special form, and it appears is truly unbound and high-powered electrical.
[02:14:10.641 --> 02:14:12.123]  Okay, and I'm just putting it in layman's terms.
[02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:16.374]  To go in and just strip out the fluoride and all the garbage.
[02:14:16.814 --> 02:14:18.557]  And I know it's really helped my clarity.
[02:14:18.577 --> 02:14:19.518]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:14:19.959 --> 02:14:20.940]  Dr. Grip is a genius.
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:24.565]  Okay, this is, this has been around for 20 years, but nobody even knew about it.
[02:14:24.585 --> 02:14:26.708]  There's the other iodines out there, which you certainly need.
[02:14:27.008 --> 02:14:30.252]  I'm not knocking those, but it tastes like rocket fuel, and I've taken them.
[02:14:30.273 --> 02:14:30.993]  It didn't do the same thing.
[02:14:31.574 --> 02:14:36.496]  This is available at Infowarslife.com or calling 888-253-3139.
[02:14:36.776 --> 02:14:38.777]  But I didn't get into that because of that.
[02:14:38.797 --> 02:14:45.721]  I just started thinking, wow, I'm talking about the fluorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, and then I'm not, and then here's the solution sitting right there.
[02:14:45.741 --> 02:14:47.421]  The real solution is get it out of your water.
[02:14:50.563 --> 02:14:51.503]  Here's an example right now.
[02:14:52.464 --> 02:14:57.066]  The American Dental Association, American Medical Association, seven years ago,
[02:14:58.942 --> 02:15:01.627]  Came out because of lawsuits and their own scientists going public.
[02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:04.854]  And the EPA folks appear as a forum going public.
[02:15:04.874 --> 02:15:05.916]  They went public again last year.
[02:15:06.417 --> 02:15:10.444]  They went and they had it all in their paperwork.
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:13.600]  But the dentists don't even know this because they haven't read the paperwork.
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:14.341]  They said, no, it's true.
[02:15:14.721 --> 02:15:26.804]  Under five, now they're saying under seven, just this year, do not brush your teeth with fluoride, do not swallow it, do not take the pills, do not take the treatments, and do not drink water that has it in it.
[02:15:27.504 --> 02:15:28.064]  So what do they do?
[02:15:28.104 --> 02:15:31.745]  They come out with baby water with souped up fluoride in it.
[02:15:33.886 --> 02:15:37.727]  Which on record is a massive reduction in IQ.
[02:15:39.187 --> 02:15:42.390]  You give children this stuff when they're a baby, you might as well beat their head up against a wall.
[02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:43.691]  I mean, you might as well give them a lobotomy.
[02:15:43.711 --> 02:15:45.332]  It's basically a soft-core lobotomy.
[02:15:46.593 --> 02:15:47.094]  There it is.
[02:15:47.374 --> 02:15:49.936]  CDC and ADA now advise to avoid using fluoride.
[02:15:49.976 --> 02:15:51.838]  Now, you bring that in...
[02:15:52.970 --> 02:16:08.394]  To the city council in a brief, you go visit all the council members first, and you say, here's the FDA and EPA, forced last year by the vast majority of their scientists, signing a paper and threatening to leave or sue, that it's giving people cancer, brain damaging them, and causing dental fluorosis and bone fractures.
[02:16:08.974 --> 02:16:09.875]  Get it out of the water.
[02:16:09.955 --> 02:16:17.997]  So, the FDA had to come out with the EPA last year and say, okay, phase it out of pesticide, phase it out of the water.
[02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:20.291]  You think that was a victory?
[02:16:20.311 --> 02:16:21.351]  That was in the New York Times?
[02:16:22.011 --> 02:16:22.292]  No!
[02:16:22.992 --> 02:16:24.573]  They're fluoridating more cities!
[02:16:24.933 --> 02:16:27.274]  They don't care, because of course they're not stopping!
[02:16:27.794 --> 02:16:39.320]  You think they're gonna let us remove the adjuvant that supercharges all of this from the food and the water so that they'll have to put megadoses in the water and the food to get us there?
[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:43.102]  It's only turbocharging, God knows what else they're putting in!
[02:16:45.728 --> 02:16:48.770]  The Soviets, the Nazis, used pharma to control people.
[02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:52.211]  Now they're doing it through the stinking water and the food, okay?
[02:16:52.251 --> 02:16:52.852]  It's a fact.
[02:16:53.232 --> 02:16:55.453]  The Russians used it, the Nazis picked it up.
[02:16:55.493 --> 02:16:56.793]  It came out in the Nuremberg trial.
[02:16:57.134 --> 02:16:58.234]  They're force-drugging us.
[02:17:00.135 --> 02:17:04.277]  And then I take the nascent iodine, and what does it do for me?
[02:17:04.337 --> 02:17:06.518]  It helps with all the environmental crap, helps strip it out.
[02:17:06.538 --> 02:17:07.159]  Oh, I just love it!
[02:17:08.319 --> 02:17:09.920]  You can go to, you know, where, New World Order?
[02:17:11.463 --> 02:17:13.524]  I have the good fluorine, jackasses!
[02:17:14.185 --> 02:17:15.565]  And I'm telling everybody about it!
[02:17:15.585 --> 02:17:20.288]  You don't have to even get mine, just go get one of the gourmet salts that has it in it.
[02:17:21.148 --> 02:17:22.709]  It's not like this, but it's good enough.
[02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:24.190]  Gourmet salts!
[02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:25.371]  Try that one, I don't even sell them.
[02:17:25.411 --> 02:17:25.711]  Get them!
[02:17:26.829 --> 02:17:27.749]  See what happens.
[02:17:27.769 --> 02:17:30.030]  Of course Bloomberg says you shouldn't have salt.
[02:17:30.690 --> 02:17:36.591]  They want to make a law, the White House regulations are, Cass Sunstein, that you shouldn't get sun and sun's bad for you, period.
[02:17:36.991 --> 02:17:40.012]  And anyone that says you need sun for vitamin D is a liar.
[02:17:40.272 --> 02:17:53.795]  There are so many studies on record from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, British Medical Journal, that you've got to get at least 30 minutes of sun a week or you would basically die.
[02:17:55.054 --> 02:17:57.535]  In countries where they don't get sun, their cancer rates are off the chart.
[02:17:57.736 --> 02:18:03.599]  They sort of put the sun lamps in like Norway and places inside the houses and suicide rate and cancer rates are going down.
[02:18:03.879 --> 02:18:05.720]  You're like a freaking plant, folks.
[02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:08.482]  You don't have photosynthesis, you have another synthesis.
[02:18:08.682 --> 02:18:10.163]  You got to have it!
[02:18:12.324 --> 02:18:15.306]  And yes, it ends up burning your skin and it ends up giving you cancer.
[02:18:15.486 --> 02:18:16.766]  But you'll die quicker if you don't.
[02:18:16.947 --> 02:18:18.007]  You're meant to go out there.
[02:18:18.027 --> 02:18:19.028]  You're meant to die.
[02:18:20.285 --> 02:18:25.029]  You got all these radiation waves of every type you can imagine blasting through us in the universe.
[02:18:25.049 --> 02:18:25.949]  We're basically hollow.
[02:18:27.691 --> 02:18:28.812]  But you've got to have it.
[02:18:29.847 --> 02:18:31.167]  You've got to have a sleep cycle.
[02:18:31.327 --> 02:18:32.548]  You're meant to go to bed at night.
[02:18:32.748 --> 02:18:34.548]  You're meant to get up when the chickens wake up.
[02:18:34.768 --> 02:18:35.929]  That's what you're designed to do.
[02:18:36.749 --> 02:18:38.209]  I'm ranting, I said I'd help the caller.
[02:18:38.729 --> 02:18:53.473]  You bring all that to your city council, you publish it in the newspaper, you know, that you've given them as a notice you're going to sue, and then you sue them for forced drugging, you sue them for not following the EPA and FDA guidelines, and they'll laugh at you and say you're powerless, you can't sue us, we're the government.
[02:18:54.133 --> 02:18:54.673]  B.S.
[02:18:55.154 --> 02:18:59.877]  It's all a mind game saying, you know, that the emperor is wearing clothes when he's butt naked.
[02:18:59.897 --> 02:19:01.499]  Does that answer your question, Kyle?
[02:19:01.839 --> 02:19:04.521]  We have the evidence, we have the facts, we have it all on our side.
[02:19:04.801 --> 02:19:06.542]  You were asking how you get the cities to do it.
[02:19:06.943 --> 02:19:14.288]  You simply bring it all to the city council under the mayor and you keep bringing it to him and you say, you come back at Citizens Communication every week and you say, did you read the briefing?
[02:19:14.528 --> 02:19:15.429]  You say, okay, fine.
[02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:18.452]  I brought friends here to give me their time to read the briefing.
[02:19:18.652 --> 02:19:20.073]  You read the mainstream news headlines.
[02:19:20.093 --> 02:19:21.214]  You read the study headlines.
[02:19:21.535 --> 02:19:22.496]  You tell them what happened.
[02:19:23.477 --> 02:19:25.499]  You threaten to sue these stores.
[02:19:25.959 --> 02:19:28.562]  Listen, I've already been told by CVS and Walgreens managers.
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:34.804]  One of them will come at me on video that's on the YouTube channel and say, yeah, we can't even sell it now because of you!
[02:19:35.565 --> 02:19:37.947]  Literally, people say, I want that off the shelves and they won't buy it.
[02:19:38.247 --> 02:19:46.034]  Just from me talking about it mainly, and others, like Mercola and others, they're pulling it off a lot of shelves because we just won't buy it.
[02:19:46.474 --> 02:19:48.997]  Just warn everyone, that's a chemical weapon to hurt your baby.
[02:19:49.197 --> 02:19:50.818]  Doesn't mean the stupid manager knows that.
[02:19:50.998 --> 02:19:51.899]  He grew up drinking it.
[02:19:52.139 --> 02:19:53.280]  He's walking dead from it.
[02:19:53.861 --> 02:19:55.042]  Does that answer your question, Kyle?
[02:19:56.275 --> 02:19:56.675]  Yes, sir.
[02:19:56.695 --> 02:19:57.175]  I appreciate it.
[02:19:57.235 --> 02:19:59.076]  And I am currently taking an iodine.
[02:19:59.116 --> 02:20:00.236]  My mom got us one.
[02:20:00.336 --> 02:20:01.077]  So she's got one.
[02:20:01.117 --> 02:20:01.617]  I got one.
[02:20:01.677 --> 02:20:04.297]  And I'm fine beyond taming tangerine very soon, too.
[02:20:04.698 --> 02:20:05.438]  God bless you, brother.
[02:20:05.498 --> 02:20:06.298]  Or just eat oranges.
[02:20:06.338 --> 02:20:06.618]  Whatever.
[02:20:06.658 --> 02:20:09.699]  The point is that you need vitamin C. It's very evil.
[02:20:09.719 --> 02:20:20.082]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:20:20.402 --> 02:20:22.243]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:20:22.443 --> 02:20:23.123]  Fluoride.
[02:20:23.323 --> 02:20:25.124]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:20:25.244 --> 02:20:31.566]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:20:31.826 --> 02:20:34.647]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:20:34.767 --> 02:20:36.607]  And the results are on record.
[02:20:36.747 --> 02:20:42.869]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:20:43.069 --> 02:20:45.230]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:48.111]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:20:48.411 --> 02:20:51.812]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:20:51.912 --> 02:20:57.139]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:20:57.359 --> 02:21:02.165]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:21:09.814 --> 02:21:13.256]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:21:13.476 --> 02:21:17.177]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:21:17.277 --> 02:21:23.200]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:33.544]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:21:33.684 --> 02:21:38.106]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 probiotic from Terragenic.
[02:21:38.346 --> 02:21:48.368]  Pro-EM1 probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.
[02:21:48.508 --> 02:21:59.991]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.

[02:22:09.517 --> 02:22:14.521]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[02:22:14.681 --> 02:22:17.804]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[02:22:18.184 --> 02:22:24.209]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:22:24.329 --> 02:22:36.259]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:22:36.559 --> 02:22:40.885]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[02:22:41.145 --> 02:22:42.707]  And they're so easy to use.
[02:22:42.927 --> 02:22:44.830]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[02:22:44.850 --> 02:22:48.574]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[02:22:48.855 --> 02:22:50.457]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.

[02:22:58.464 --> 02:22:59.805]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[02:23:10.191 --> 02:23:17.817]  That's the sound of a .44 Magnum and TraumaMaxx, a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof vest from InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:23:17.917 --> 02:23:20.179]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.
[02:23:20.419 --> 02:23:25.364]  TraumaMaxx is a major breakthrough in pistol-rated body armor and prices start at just $170 per insert.
[02:23:27.225 --> 02:23:28.045]  More protection.
[02:23:28.165 --> 02:23:29.186]  More stopping power.
[02:23:29.246 --> 02:23:30.146]  More mobility.
[02:23:30.406 --> 02:23:32.287]  And it weighs less than 5 pounds.
[02:23:32.467 --> 02:23:34.988]  Get details at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:23:35.108 --> 02:23:38.429]  That's I-N-F-I-D-E-L-BodyArmor.com.
[02:23:38.769 --> 02:23:42.851]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[02:23:43.011 --> 02:23:45.452]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored.
[02:23:45.592 --> 02:23:50.294]  And more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[02:23:50.414 --> 02:23:54.395]  PRI Fuel Stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[02:23:54.515 --> 02:23:56.996]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers,
[02:23:57.316 --> 02:23:58.037]  And you can too!
[02:24:20.799 --> 02:24:28.543]  Alright, coming up is an interview with Vivian Kubrick, and then I'll do a little bit of overdrive for those that are patiently holding Kathy, Chris, Alan, Phil, John.
[02:24:28.583 --> 02:24:29.483]  I'll try to get to all of you.
[02:24:29.523 --> 02:24:40.208]  I appreciate you calling in on a whole host of subjects like CIA and terrorism, JFK protest, candidate for governor wants to talk, folks want to talk about a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:24:40.909 --> 02:24:41.669]  Look at this headline.
[02:24:41.709 --> 02:24:47.232]  I hope it's not all foggy and cloudy like it's been coming up this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, because
[02:24:48.502 --> 02:24:52.145]  My dad's got a big Meade telescope from back when I was in college.
[02:24:52.165 --> 02:25:10.320]  We would go out like every few weeks out to the, like Llano, the kind of scrub brush desert on clear nights and just take incredible photos with 35 millimeter adapter on film of comets and Jupiter and Saturn and I've got a big shoebox of film of all that somewhere.
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:11.862]  I'd go into Walgreens and get it developed.
[02:25:12.722 --> 02:25:14.684]  We got to get out that telescope and clean it up.
[02:25:14.724 --> 02:25:16.486]  We've used it since then, but it's all dirty and
[02:25:17.506 --> 02:25:18.487]  It's been around for a while.
[02:25:18.507 --> 02:25:21.730]  It's been around almost 20 years, but it's a big, nice 12-inch.
[02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:23.872]  I guess this is the reflector or refractor?
[02:25:25.294 --> 02:25:26.014]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:25:26.455 --> 02:25:27.576]  Yeah, but it's a big round one.
[02:25:27.856 --> 02:25:29.037]  It's a big, fat, short ones.
[02:25:29.057 --> 02:25:30.138]  I used to know a lot about them.
[02:25:32.041 --> 02:25:33.101]  I've forgotten a lot about them.
[02:25:33.381 --> 02:25:39.126]  But I want to get out there and look at that because it's supposedly maybe the brightest comet seen in modern times.
[02:25:39.946 --> 02:25:42.148]  So we'll be covering that, obviously.
[02:25:43.189 --> 02:25:45.230]  French riders protest over taxing.
[02:25:45.310 --> 02:25:46.151]  Horses will suffer.
[02:25:46.471 --> 02:25:52.555]  Thousands of horse lovers paraded their animals through central Paris on Sunday in a protest against a planned sales tax they say will put riding centers...
[02:25:53.476 --> 02:25:55.717]  Out of business and send horses to the slaughterhouse.
[02:25:56.178 --> 02:26:00.980]  Yeah, folks, they've got carbon taxes, gas taxes, new sales taxes.
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:03.822]  The average French person pays over 80% in tax.
[02:26:04.282 --> 02:26:06.903]  The middle class pays 100% right now.
[02:26:07.444 --> 02:26:08.464]  You're like, that's impossible.
[02:26:08.524 --> 02:26:09.625]  No, it's meant to bankrupt them.
[02:26:09.665 --> 02:26:10.245]  That's the plan.
[02:26:10.725 --> 02:26:13.987]  And then the ultra rich billionaires, they pay nothing on record.
[02:26:14.027 --> 02:26:14.747]  They just pay nothing.
[02:26:15.868 --> 02:26:20.791]  They all leave the country, but then govern in the country and have laws passed that they can have Swiss bank accounts and
[02:26:22.489 --> 02:26:23.050]  It's all come out.
[02:26:23.070 --> 02:26:23.810]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:24.851]  So just total evil.
[02:26:26.653 --> 02:26:27.614]  And this is what this is what.
[02:26:28.515 --> 02:26:36.902]  Listen, government can be a force of good if good people are in it and it's small and focused and has a mission and a vigilant people are governed by it who keep it on a short leash.
[02:26:37.263 --> 02:26:43.008]  But when you get a big decadent slob population with decadent, tyrannical, piratical
[02:26:46.246 --> 02:26:55.890]  Corporations that are bigger than government and operate like government and use it as a tool, it is then the conduit where the rubber meets the road of enslavement.
[02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:59.131]  I'm trying to hurry because I've got other news to cover before we go to break.
[02:27:00.292 --> 02:27:10.196]  And just like the FDA and the EPA, their own scientist got mad, signed petitions internally, demanded fluoride be taken out of the water.
[02:27:11.155 --> 02:27:14.917]  But still it hasn't been because the globalists control the top of the government.
[02:27:15.598 --> 02:27:22.582]  So there are good people in government, I want to get that straight, who are actually focused and caring and involved.
[02:27:23.923 --> 02:27:36.030]  But still, we've now got to put pressure on the system and use their research and facts that 90, the last number I saw was almost every EPA scientist,
[02:27:37.057 --> 02:27:39.157]  Signed on to saying it's deadly poison, get it out.
[02:27:39.497 --> 02:27:40.438]  And people don't even know that.
[02:27:40.458 --> 02:27:42.018]  They don't even know you can go pull those articles up.
[02:27:42.898 --> 02:27:44.298]  So that's an example of that.
[02:27:45.779 --> 02:27:48.539]  Now I mentioned this, and I'm not going to have time to get into it in detail.
[02:27:48.579 --> 02:27:51.460]  I've got to do it tomorrow, or do a special video or something.
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:28:03.202]  Inside a Twitter robot factory, and this is really nothing here, but it just gets into how you can pay
[02:28:04.926 --> 02:28:09.709]  $58 from an online vendor in Pakistan and get a thousand fake Twitter followers.
[02:28:12.030 --> 02:28:13.831]  But the big companies all do this.
[02:28:13.911 --> 02:28:14.951]  Sony's been caught doing it.
[02:28:14.971 --> 02:28:15.992]  They've all been caught doing it.
[02:28:16.612 --> 02:28:27.718]  Where all these big Hollywood stars and people literally pay to get four or five million fake followers and in the news division that actually owns that star's career that they're signed with,
[02:28:29.318 --> 02:28:36.820]  In many cases, who they've got TV shows with, whatever the case is, they will then go, look, this star's got 5, 6, 7 million followers.
[02:28:37.241 --> 02:28:39.961]  Or the record company will pay to have TV report that.
[02:28:40.722 --> 02:28:49.144]  And so, there's the headline, Barack Obama is political king of the fake Twitter followers, and more than 19.5 million online fans who don't really exist.
[02:28:50.605 --> 02:28:51.065]  And that's it.
[02:28:51.085 --> 02:28:55.126]  You go to his YouTube channel, his videos have like a thousand views.
[02:28:55.146 --> 02:28:56.787]  That's just because they haven't paid for fake bots.
[02:28:57.864 --> 02:29:03.588]  Now we've gone and actually looked at it and found that we're actually getting more visitors.
[02:29:04.597 --> 02:29:06.939]  And more views on videos.
[02:29:07.399 --> 02:29:11.062]  We've done this by putting it on a page and then we have something that can track and see if we're actually clicking it.
[02:29:11.482 --> 02:29:14.444]  And we know more people are watching YouTube videos that we put up.
[02:29:14.464 --> 02:29:17.346]  We've done the test about five times in the test we did.
[02:29:17.906 --> 02:29:19.367]  And another test about three and a half times.
[02:29:19.768 --> 02:29:21.929]  So they've got like some governor on the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:29:22.189 --> 02:29:24.211]  So I told Watson, I said, get a YouTube channel.
[02:29:24.751 --> 02:29:28.394]  Do the exact same videos you do on my YouTube on yours and see what happens.
[02:29:28.454 --> 02:29:29.935]  And they get five times the views.
[02:29:30.716 --> 02:29:31.578]  His average video is about 200,000.
[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:32.240]  Ours is about 50,000.
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:33.705]  So, that's how this works.
[02:29:38.553 --> 02:29:48.878]  And it's there, and it's all game, and it's all fake, and it creates the perception that they're the mainstream, that their ideas are dominant, and they're popular, when in truth, they're all collapsing and falling in on themselves.
[02:29:49.318 --> 02:29:59.544]  Now, a very thought-provoking and intriguing premiere of an in-depth interview with Stanley Kubrick's amazing daughter coming up, and then we're going to put it on YouTube for everybody.
[02:29:59.584 --> 02:30:00.064]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.084 --> 02:30:00.544]  For everybody.
[02:30:00.564 --> 02:30:01.805]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.825 --> 02:30:03.145]  In about an hour at InfoWars.com.

[02:31:12.913 --> 02:31:18.655]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:31:18.875 --> 02:31:25.257]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[02:31:25.457 --> 02:31:30.859]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[02:31:31.139 --> 02:31:34.780]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:38.523]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

[02:31:45.890 --> 02:31:49.433]  Don't dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[02:31:49.733 --> 02:31:54.017]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[02:31:54.157 --> 02:31:56.800]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[02:31:57.100 --> 02:32:03.645]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[02:32:03.925 --> 02:32:08.648]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com.
[02:32:09.209 --> 02:32:13.792]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:32:13.932 --> 02:32:16.254]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on
[02:32:16.254 --> 02:32:22.257]  On the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:32:22.597 --> 02:32:24.258]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:32:24.519 --> 02:32:25.839]  We are what we eat.
[02:32:26.159 --> 02:32:30.502]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:32:30.842 --> 02:32:34.804]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:32:35.064 --> 02:32:37.386]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:32:37.606 --> 02:32:43.509]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:33:16.664 --> 02:33:18.847]  Our interview with Ms.
[02:33:18.887 --> 02:33:19.247]  Kubrick.
[02:33:20.268 --> 02:33:21.449]  My name is Vivian Kubrick.
[02:33:21.810 --> 02:33:23.071]  My father was Stanley Kubrick.
[02:33:23.932 --> 02:33:35.065]  I live here in Dallas, and I think I have enough experience from that aspect of being Stanley Kubrick's daughter to know that there are really some things that you have to fight very hard for.
[02:33:35.205 --> 02:33:37.587]  And my father's an artist, fought very hard for the
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:45.204]  The integrity of his films because even he was subject to a lot of pressure to not make the films he made.
[02:33:57.731 --> 02:34:01.454]  I would say three different sheriffs came up and they, may I demonstrate on you?
[02:34:02.815 --> 02:34:03.615]  They went like this.
[02:34:04.336 --> 02:34:05.136]  You have to look down.
[02:34:05.496 --> 02:34:07.398]  They literally just went like that.
[02:34:07.418 --> 02:34:08.939]  And I said, hey, don't push me.
[02:34:08.959 --> 02:34:10.540]  And they said, keep moving.
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:11.881]  I said, I am moving.
[02:34:11.901 --> 02:34:12.821]  And I said, turn around.
[02:34:13.302 --> 02:34:16.644]  And I was like going, well, I, you know, I'm walking, I'm moving.
[02:34:17.104 --> 02:34:21.587]  And then again, separate two other ones push me like that.
[02:34:21.627 --> 02:34:22.087]  I'm sorry.
[02:34:22.107 --> 02:34:23.028]  I keep shoving him.
[02:34:23.628 --> 02:34:27.231]  And it just seemed to me like, why would you be so aggressive?
[02:34:28.431 --> 02:34:29.972]  This man is obviously a psychotic.
[02:34:30.973 --> 02:34:35.395]  Why can't you just say, okay, everyone, would you mind just going over here?
[02:34:35.956 --> 02:34:38.077]  Excellent on your First Amendment rights.
[02:34:39.117 --> 02:34:40.718]  How about you stand over there?
[02:34:40.758 --> 02:34:45.561]  Because we've been told by Homeland Security or whoever told them that you can't be here.
[02:34:46.261 --> 02:34:47.442]  Why can't they be truthful?
[02:34:47.782 --> 02:34:49.323]  Why can't they be polite?
[02:34:50.063 --> 02:34:51.544]  Why can't they just be calm?
[02:34:51.924 --> 02:34:53.345]  Why do they have to be aggressive?
[02:34:53.945 --> 02:35:00.528]  I mean, I was doing nothing, and in fact, when everyone was shouting and going crazy, I mean, to be honest with you, it was all love and respect.
[02:35:00.949 --> 02:35:06.011]  I also felt that it's wrong to shout at the police, you slaves, you scumbags!
[02:35:06.111 --> 02:35:13.175]  Because I feel, honestly, I feel sorry for them because I believe that, I can't believe that all of them are just dead in the head.
[02:35:13.675 --> 02:35:14.676]  I just can't believe that.
[02:35:15.336 --> 02:35:18.698]  Sure, well let's recap from what you saw being here today for the last two, three hours then.
[02:35:19.078 --> 02:35:27.783]  We come over, it's over, there's been lawsuits filed, they had to let us in, the Dallas Police said yes, you're allowed to go in to the second perimeter, to the first perimeter, not into the final one.
[02:35:28.183 --> 02:35:32.266]  Then that was open for a private wreath laying for folks that don't agree with official stories.
[02:35:32.306 --> 02:35:41.511]  So we were supposed to be let in, they let us in, the Dallas Police did, and then Homeland Security sent over their auxiliary federalized sheriff's deputies.
[02:35:43.576 --> 02:35:44.936]  So that's what happened there.
[02:35:44.956 --> 02:35:47.217]  Did you notice how they came in and ordered the other cops to stand back?
[02:35:48.037 --> 02:35:48.977]  I wasn't looking at that.
[02:35:49.037 --> 02:35:52.558]  I was actually looking at each police with my sign, sorry, with my First Amendment.
[02:35:52.578 --> 02:35:57.279]  I was just trying to gently smile at them like going, hey, this is for you too, you know.
[02:35:57.659 --> 02:36:06.722]  This is for everyone that you love and care about and you too, because there isn't a police state that's ever been on this planet where everyone didn't get their ass burnt when it really got going.
[02:36:07.182 --> 02:36:12.143]  I mean, Hitler's regime, all the original people that were in the government or helping him.
[02:36:13.550 --> 02:36:13.910]  I'm afraid.
[02:36:39.557 --> 02:36:49.102]  And I personally, I'm just desperate for the things that are beautiful and wonderful and exalted about the American people.
[02:36:49.122 --> 02:36:57.086]  It should reign in this country again instead of the incredibly obvious criminality that's going on here.
[02:36:57.106 --> 02:36:58.047]  I mean, it's like
[02:36:58.867 --> 02:37:02.408]  You'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind to not see what's happening.
[02:37:02.788 --> 02:37:05.229]  So I'm just really proud of everyone here.
[02:37:05.249 --> 02:37:08.630]  I don't agree that all the police are slaves.
[02:37:09.051 --> 02:37:12.572]  I think that they're under incredible pressure to behave.
[02:37:12.632 --> 02:37:13.152]  Peer pressure.
[02:37:13.392 --> 02:37:18.694]  Yeah, to behave in a way where I believe that at a certain point, they're going to stop behaving that way.
[02:37:19.254 --> 02:37:20.835]  And I don't know what will happen then.
[02:37:20.875 --> 02:37:24.196]  I guess the National Guard or some other lunatics will come in and kick our heads in.
[02:37:24.236 --> 02:37:27.477]  But I mean, okay, bring it on, but the change must come.
[02:37:28.237 --> 02:37:30.298]  And I'm praying for it.
[02:37:30.318 --> 02:37:32.178]  Sure, you know, I'm not looking for physical stuff.
[02:37:32.218 --> 02:37:33.398]  I want them to be free and happy.
[02:37:33.818 --> 02:37:35.899]  But, I mean, I got punched in the stomach first.
[02:37:37.479 --> 02:37:41.320]  And so, they were all targeted by Homeland Security now that I'm not emotional.
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:49.102]  Then I gave in and let them be mean to me and shove some guys head over and over again into that and punch some person and almost knock a little girl into the ground.
[02:37:49.382 --> 02:37:52.823]  But then they chased us around, passed the barricades and attacked us again.
[02:37:53.603 --> 02:37:55.184]  The thing is, is that why do it?
[02:37:55.244 --> 02:38:10.631]  They're supposed to be peace officers, not guys being intimidating, pushing a woman who is doing nothing but doing what they're saying, shoving me in a way that if I was in a bar and I was six foot two and a man, I'd probably get in a fight.
[02:38:11.531 --> 02:38:17.974]  When do you actually take on your own ability to think for yourself, even if you're in a position where you're supposed to take orders?
[02:38:18.494 --> 02:38:19.935]  When does that point arrive?
[02:38:20.455 --> 02:38:26.818]  And that's the point that these police officers need to get to, which is why I feel sad when you guys scream at them, you slaves, you f***ers, you bastards!
[02:38:26.838 --> 02:38:35.262]  You know, it's like, I just wish that actually, seriously, I mean, I thought about doing it and then I got shy, but I just felt like saying,
[02:38:36.002 --> 02:38:42.706]  Listen, I don't know what you're thinking, but please stand up for what's right.
[02:38:43.026 --> 02:38:44.547]  They surely know what that is.
[02:38:44.847 --> 02:38:46.809]  We're just talking about First Amendment stuff.
[02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:52.432]  Well, by the way, the Dallas police, when they came over, were like, what are you doing?
[02:38:52.452 --> 02:38:54.033]  They told them to let them in.
[02:38:54.113 --> 02:38:56.655]  And the point was that was that was ordered by the feds.
[02:38:56.695 --> 02:38:56.915]  Yeah.
[02:38:57.745 --> 02:39:00.847]  That's just crazy.
[02:39:02.549 --> 02:39:03.449]  Well, anyway, listen.
[02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:08.613]  Hey, just the guys I want to talk to.
[02:39:10.775 --> 02:39:11.455]  Sir, what's your name?
[02:39:12.916 --> 02:39:16.859]  Where do I file about the Sheriff's Department that was here?
[02:39:16.879 --> 02:39:19.061]  Oh, come on, you can talk to him.
[02:39:22.884 --> 02:39:25.206]  So the Sheriff's Department's in charge here?
[02:39:26.465 --> 02:39:28.746]  Because they assaulted us when the Dallas Police let us in.
[02:39:28.766 --> 02:39:30.246]  We were supposed to be let in.
[02:39:30.887 --> 02:39:34.828]  As you know, sir... Oh, come on, you can talk to... Don't defend him!
[02:39:35.108 --> 02:39:37.489]  You're not ignoring us because we're... You're on private property.
[02:39:37.629 --> 02:39:38.589]  Silence is complicity.
[02:39:39.570 --> 02:39:40.490]  Oh, private property.
[02:39:40.530 --> 02:39:41.470]  What is this, city property?
[02:39:42.631 --> 02:39:44.311]  Well, you're on private property.
[02:39:45.552 --> 02:39:52.094]  The imperious nature... I don't know who that guy is.
[02:39:53.598 --> 02:39:54.339]  Private property.
[02:39:54.379 --> 02:39:56.540]  The Dallas Police Department is private property.
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:39:57.441]  Can you hear me Alex?
[02:39:57.481 --> 02:39:57.981]  Masters.
[02:39:58.781 --> 02:39:59.462]  Can you hear me Alex?
[02:39:59.802 --> 02:40:00.463]  Yes, David Knight.
[02:40:00.883 --> 02:40:09.769]  I gotta say, when I'm watching this on television, one of the things that has really been making me angry all day is the attitude we just saw from that cop you tried to talk to.
[02:40:09.789 --> 02:40:11.870]  And this is going on yesterday as well.
[02:40:12.130 --> 02:40:17.054]  You walk up to them, you ask them a polite question, they just ignore you like you're not even there.
[02:40:17.094 --> 02:40:18.775]  Like you're treating you like you're trash.
[02:40:19.235 --> 02:40:22.902]  It's that kind of arrogant attitude and that's what's behind all this stuff.
[02:40:23.203 --> 02:40:23.964]  That's what we've been seeing.
[02:40:23.984 --> 02:40:26.429]  I'm not surprised at all to see these guys come out and attack you.
[02:40:26.689 --> 02:40:28.573]  They don't treat you with any respect.
[02:40:28.613 --> 02:40:29.936]  They have no respect for the public.
[02:40:30.965 --> 02:40:31.506]  I agree.
[02:40:31.686 --> 02:40:33.887]  Finishing up your point, I'm sorry I broke that off when they walked by.
[02:40:34.308 --> 02:40:37.190]  David Knight, my co-host, was just pointing out the imperious nature.
[02:40:37.390 --> 02:40:38.191]  I was very polite.
[02:40:38.751 --> 02:40:40.292]  I wanted to say I was assaulted.
[02:40:40.873 --> 02:40:46.197]  And he literally knew about it because I saw him looking at us out the window all day and pointing at me and, you know, waving when he was up there.
[02:40:46.217 --> 02:40:47.238]  That same police officer.
[02:40:47.698 --> 02:40:49.620]  The guy with two stars on his thing.
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:51.101]  He rules a third world country.
[02:40:51.821 --> 02:40:52.382]  But the point...
[02:40:54.411 --> 02:40:54.871]  No, I know.
[02:40:54.911 --> 02:40:55.852]  He used disinfo.
[02:40:56.252 --> 02:41:00.733]  He said public parking just to get me to leave him alone, like I wasn't allowed to be there, and then shoved my hand away.
[02:41:03.795 --> 02:41:06.396]  Why do you think they are frightened of talking to you?
[02:41:06.756 --> 02:41:08.056]  Because that's clearly what that is.
[02:41:08.116 --> 02:41:11.537]  That's fear, inhibition, unwillingness to communicate.
[02:41:11.578 --> 02:41:13.558]  What's that about?
[02:41:13.718 --> 02:41:18.880]  Why are they... I mean, maybe that's not a question you can answer, but... No, I know why.
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:22.902]  Because they're in such a controlled culture of compartmentalization and being dominated.
[02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:28.051]  They just are in a position where they can dominate people under them, they get dominated from above, it's all hierarchical.
[02:41:29.332 --> 02:41:34.534]  Right, but imagine that you say to him, could you explain to us why the following, whatever your question might be.
[02:41:35.074 --> 02:41:36.275]  Why can't he stand there?
[02:41:36.355 --> 02:41:37.635]  He is a public servant.
[02:41:38.135 --> 02:41:39.936]  He is a peace officer, right?
[02:41:40.136 --> 02:41:42.517]  A peace officer, a servant of the public.
[02:41:42.958 --> 02:41:44.458]  Why can't he communicate with you?
[02:41:44.478 --> 02:41:52.122]  That's because they put military occupation rules in, where no one's allowed to talk but the public spokespeople, so it dehumanizes them.
[02:41:52.822 --> 02:41:59.008]  Just like they tell soldiers now, even when you're off duty in civilian clothes, don't be political, don't say what you believe in if you're against the war.
[02:41:59.349 --> 02:42:02.412]  Even though as a citizen, the law says you're allowed to, they intimidate.
[02:42:02.672 --> 02:42:04.634]  Freedom of speech, even for them.
[02:42:04.654 --> 02:42:05.815]  What's with that?
[02:42:05.855 --> 02:42:06.416]  Well, here, tell us.
[02:42:06.616 --> 02:42:10.220]  Well, no, I mean, I just, why don't the police have freedom of speech?
[02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:12.902]  Why can't they offer their opinion?
[02:42:13.382 --> 02:42:15.684]  They're individuals, they have individual rights.
[02:42:16.064 --> 02:42:19.487]  Why should they be dominated by hierarchical instruction?
[02:42:19.507 --> 02:42:28.134]  Now that, to my mind, if they're peace officers, if they're public servants and citizens, they should be permitted to give their opinion.
[02:42:28.594 --> 02:42:30.856]  So who is it that's forbidding them to speak?
[02:42:32.017 --> 02:42:34.778]  Honestly, I just think that they're frightened to speak.
[02:42:35.498 --> 02:42:47.402]  Probably because of what you were saying, that they have just an incredible peer pressure on them, or more like an officer ranking pressure, where they are told, you are not allowed to talk about this.
[02:42:48.502 --> 02:42:49.663]  I don't see why they shouldn't.
[02:42:49.723 --> 02:42:50.563]  They're citizens.
[02:42:50.983 --> 02:42:52.284]  They have every right to speak.
[02:42:53.124 --> 02:42:55.585]  The police, as individuals, should not be shut up.
[02:42:55.625 --> 02:42:56.105]  Why should they?
[02:42:57.005 --> 02:43:02.253]  Well, I mean, you talked about it throughout history, what happens to countries when these police states come in and tyrannies.
[02:43:02.273 --> 02:43:03.154]  It just gets worse and worse.
[02:43:03.174 --> 02:43:04.556]  In fact, I'm going to steal that quote.
[02:43:05.037 --> 02:43:06.298]  Tyranny begets tyranny.
[02:43:06.318 --> 02:43:08.061]  I'll give you credit if you want me to.
[02:43:08.441 --> 02:43:10.384]  Or I'll sit there and take the credit and say I came up with it.
[02:43:10.404 --> 02:43:10.765]  I'm joking.
[02:43:11.005 --> 02:43:13.188]  But the point is, is that tyranny begets tyranny.
[02:43:13.829 --> 02:43:20.771]  And then it just spins out of control, thank God, excuse my expression, because then otherwise we'd be just under permanent tyranny.
[02:43:20.811 --> 02:43:37.337]  But tyrannies always end, not before there isn't a great deal of suffering, and I'm just hoping that through technology, the internet, the incredible, wonderful, good work that you guys do, and other, you know, independent newscasters and individuals who talk about this and try and do things on a very grassroots level,
[02:43:38.257 --> 02:43:51.301]  I'm really hoping we can circumvent what seems to be almost a turnkey totalitarian state that we are just... I mean, doesn't Obama just have to call martial law and then that's it?
[02:43:51.881 --> 02:44:03.844]  Well he's already doing most stuff by executive order outside of Congress and they put in the internet kill switch, the total surveillance grid, they call the spy systems they've put in, the battle grid, what's it called David, you were reading it today?
[02:44:04.585 --> 02:44:06.228]  It's called the battle net inside.
[02:44:06.349 --> 02:44:07.812]  Battle net, battle net, yeah.
[02:44:08.012 --> 02:44:09.135]  And it's battle with us.
[02:44:09.195 --> 02:44:10.378]  It's not battle with criminals.
[02:44:10.758 --> 02:44:12.562]  They all skim the money off the top of that.
[02:44:12.963 --> 02:44:14.447]  I mean, it is just incredible.
[02:44:17.048 --> 02:44:20.370]  I gotta say, Austin police are not anywhere as arrogant as these guys.
[02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:28.795]  And Dallas police aren't as bad as a lot I've seen, but man, I tell you, they really... Dallas citizens need to start acting like humans around the police, because it's really gone to their head.
[02:44:28.835 --> 02:44:33.898]  I mean, a lot of these cops, some of them I can tell are listeners and wave at me and stuff, but some of them are serious mental patients.
[02:44:34.118 --> 02:44:38.181]  Can you imagine just walking around in a uniform feeling powerful, because you're part of a power structure?
[02:44:38.661 --> 02:44:42.824]  Well, I think, you know, unconsciousness is something people really need to understand.
[02:44:42.844 --> 02:44:53.911]  I think, you know, people assume that everyone is fully in their own skull and present and attending life, but I think a lot of people are so profoundly disengaged.
[02:44:55.632 --> 02:45:11.492]  So out of communication that they really just fall beneath a certain level of awareness so that I don't think they're capable of actually seeing what's going on around them and making a choice for themselves that they should do a certain thing.
[02:45:11.612 --> 02:45:12.553]  In other words, a good thing.
[02:45:12.933 --> 02:45:13.975]  So anyway, that's my own...
[02:45:14.235 --> 02:45:18.698]  And we were here an hour ago being attacked, and here we are now, it's all opened up.
[02:45:19.198 --> 02:45:23.921]  But they were supposed to open it up, and then they were just waiting for a call, even though it had already all been decided.
[02:45:24.201 --> 02:45:25.842]  We were following what was agreed upon.
[02:45:27.043 --> 02:45:29.424]  One of the head cops called and goes, yeah, that's true, let him in.
[02:45:29.444 --> 02:45:36.089]  And then Homeland Security, the federal building, the same federal government taken over 50 years ago today.
[02:45:37.059 --> 02:45:47.461]  They literally ordered auxiliary police, for special unit, over to attack us and try to start a fight, but they failed, and now the info is going out.
[02:45:47.702 --> 02:45:54.963]  What is your overall view of the state of the world, the whole world government, the whole cybernetic systems, the whole technocracy?
[02:45:54.983 --> 02:45:56.704]  It is a turnkey takeover.
[02:45:56.964 --> 02:45:59.064]  What do you think the endgame of the rulers are?
[02:45:59.084 --> 02:46:05.666]  Because everything I see them doing is trying to suppress human consciousness and awakening, because they know there's an awakening happening, in my view.
[02:46:05.806 --> 02:46:06.506]  What's your take on that?
[02:46:07.110 --> 02:46:09.853]  Well, actually, it just makes me think of There Will Be Blood.
[02:46:09.873 --> 02:46:11.975]  Did you ever see that film?
[02:46:12.055 --> 02:46:12.695]  Excellent film.
[02:46:12.855 --> 02:46:13.076]  Right.
[02:46:13.396 --> 02:46:15.138]  I can't remember the director's name.
[02:46:15.238 --> 02:46:16.719]  John Paul Johnson, something.
[02:46:16.939 --> 02:46:17.540]  Yeah, brilliant.
[02:46:18.721 --> 02:46:23.365]  I think that one has to understand that anyone that's attracted to that level of power
[02:46:24.386 --> 02:46:26.927]  I think it's already in a kind of disease state.
[02:46:26.967 --> 02:46:31.089]  Very few people would ever want to get to that level of domination, power.
[02:46:31.610 --> 02:46:35.932]  And to get to that place, you have to do a lot of really, I think, pretty bad things.
[02:46:36.392 --> 02:46:43.296]  So once those people get there, and once they get that kind of power, I think that that's what you're looking at is insanity.
[02:46:43.996 --> 02:46:58.853]  You're just looking at individuals who are insane and so mangled in their souls that they actually have no love or appreciation for the rest of humanity and I think that is what's happening on this planet.
[02:46:58.913 --> 02:47:03.318]  That those individuals have gotten to that level of power and I think they...
[02:47:03.999 --> 02:47:06.781]  You know, keep on going, like the Rockefellers.
[02:47:06.841 --> 02:47:10.883]  I don't know how they manage to keep, you know, spawning more evil creatures.
[02:47:11.484 --> 02:47:12.704]  But, you know, they do.
[02:47:13.145 --> 02:47:15.286]  And up they stay and sit on all of us.
[02:47:15.346 --> 02:47:18.007]  And it's repeated itself so many times throughout history.
[02:47:18.288 --> 02:47:23.491]  It's just now technology has given them a kind of an omnipotence.
[02:47:24.231 --> 02:47:25.653]  That is terrifying.
[02:47:25.773 --> 02:47:27.995]  And that's why laws do have to be put in place.
[02:47:28.015 --> 02:47:32.880]  And when people say, like in England, they say, well, as long as you're behaving yourself, you've got nothing to worry about.
[02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:36.163]  But they don't understand that's such a simplistic viewpoint.
[02:47:36.563 --> 02:47:45.652]  Because the very people that are protecting both intellectual, you know, domains, artistic domains, are the first ones
[02:47:46.332 --> 02:47:48.973]  Who are going to fall victims to that system.
[02:47:49.273 --> 02:47:54.416]  Yeah, of course, if you're just, you know, running a shop, you know, and you're minding your own business, no one's going to come get you.
[02:47:54.436 --> 02:48:05.741]  But the people that really keep society moving, keep art free, and really expressing what needs to be expressed, they're the first ones to get it in the back of the neck.
[02:48:05.801 --> 02:48:10.083]  And it's not in the kind of obvious way that it used to be, where you just get poison stabbed or whatever.
[02:48:10.683 --> 02:48:22.629]  You get sort of like intimidated or you get dropped out of a circle of artists that would have otherwise been, you know, backed with money or you won't get spoken about in the news.
[02:48:22.709 --> 02:48:26.971]  I mean, you get, it's a very subtle way of just eliminating you from the scene.
[02:48:26.991 --> 02:48:32.374]  But when you have those monitoring systems that we, you know, like the NSA, thank God for Edward Snowden.
[02:48:32.794 --> 02:48:33.775]  Bless his heart.
[02:48:33.975 --> 02:48:34.435]  Jesus.
[02:48:35.816 --> 02:48:37.497]  I can't imagine the embarrassment.
[02:48:37.878 --> 02:48:38.918]  Oh, that was the other thing.
[02:48:39.179 --> 02:48:44.723]  How about Obama putting, what's his name, James, what's his face, the head of the NSA?
[02:48:45.063 --> 02:48:45.563]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:48:45.903 --> 02:48:46.564]  James Clapper.
[02:48:46.684 --> 02:48:46.864]  Right.
[02:48:47.104 --> 02:48:50.587]  In charge of the independent committee that's going to investigate the NSA.
[02:48:52.165 --> 02:48:58.746]  That's like having Hitler over Nuremberg, but expanding on those key points you're making, because you're really on target with that.
[02:48:59.507 --> 02:49:15.490]  The bad guys want all the intel so you can't expose their criminal operations, and they use the intel on you, like Google sells the data it's coming out, to all the shops online, so that when you go to a shop, they know you have more money, the cookie shows it, the prices are higher.
[02:49:16.010 --> 02:49:17.732]  Like, I could do that with my shopping cart.
[02:49:17.792 --> 02:49:27.004]  I could buy that data, that metadata they call it, from Google, that cookie data, and then when they come to the Infowars.com shop, it would have a higher price.
[02:49:27.064 --> 02:49:27.745]  No, no, I'm serious.
[02:49:28.046 --> 02:49:32.672]  That's one example of what the Panopticon technology can do.
[02:49:33.272 --> 02:49:34.234]  What did you say, Panopticon?
[02:49:35.517 --> 02:49:40.301]  It's a French term, you know, for the around prison, and then they would have a tower where the guards could always watch you.
[02:49:40.321 --> 02:49:42.904]  Panopticon, panopticonic.
[02:49:43.304 --> 02:49:54.574]  Oh, well, I think the crucial thing is, is that we have to, as individuals, really, really support the Constitution, because that is the most unique
[02:49:55.652 --> 02:49:56.692]  Nowhere else has it really.
[02:49:56.732 --> 02:49:58.153]  I think maybe different countries are covering.
[02:49:58.413 --> 02:50:03.654]  It's the most unique declaration of real spiritual rights.
[02:50:04.034 --> 02:50:05.194]  And it is a spiritual thing.
[02:50:05.234 --> 02:50:08.135]  I mean, how many of us, you know, have different opinions?
[02:50:08.155 --> 02:50:19.117]  But the bottom line is, is that real independence, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, with a great regard to helping and being of service.
[02:50:19.577 --> 02:50:26.061]  Because I don't think, you know, people should just feel free that they can just go around and clock people on the head and go, yeah, well, I'm free, I'm gonna clock people on the head.
[02:50:26.102 --> 02:50:26.902]  No, it's libertarian.
[02:50:26.922 --> 02:50:30.685]  You're free to do everything you want until it hurts somebody else or crosses onto there.
[02:50:30.705 --> 02:50:36.409]  But, I mean, this is like Clockwork Orange, though, because they are hiring the criminals to be the police now.
[02:50:36.709 --> 02:50:41.912]  What we saw today, not all of them, but that key group at the middle that attacked first.
[02:50:42.553 --> 02:50:43.714]  It's impossible!
[02:50:43.794 --> 02:50:44.954]  I don't believe it!
[02:50:45.515 --> 02:50:48.337]  A job for two who are now of job age.
[02:50:49.299 --> 02:50:49.840]  The police!
[02:50:52.562 --> 02:50:56.865]  You know, I have to tell you, I just felt really sad when I saw them turn up.
[02:50:57.526 --> 02:50:58.566]  I just thought, really?
[02:50:58.847 --> 02:51:00.168]  It's going to come to this?
[02:51:00.748 --> 02:51:02.289]  We're talking about the First Amendment?
[02:51:03.210 --> 02:51:09.675]  Actually, I want to just say, there was a New Zealand TV lady that was there yesterday, and I stood behind her with my sign of the First Amendment.
[02:51:09.715 --> 02:51:13.198]  She said, don't stand there, you know, you're blocking everything.
[02:51:13.218 --> 02:51:15.379]  And I said, well, you know, I'll just stand back here.
[02:51:15.739 --> 02:51:18.882]  And anyway, we got into a little thing over it, and she didn't want me to be in the picture with her.
[02:51:19.162 --> 02:51:22.326]  I said, look, I'm not having some lunatic stand behind me with a sign.
[02:51:22.606 --> 02:51:23.928]  I said, lunatic?
[02:51:24.368 --> 02:51:26.831]  I said, I'm defending the First Amendment.
[02:51:27.452 --> 02:51:33.739]  You know, it's like the assumption that to be out here expressing yourself is an act of lunacy.
[02:51:33.979 --> 02:51:36.722]  I would say that's a pretty good indication of how
[02:51:37.663 --> 02:51:46.890]  Totally distorted reality has become for the people who are supposed to be defending truth, right?
[02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:47.350]  Reporters.
[02:51:47.430 --> 02:51:49.031]  I mean, I know you've been interviewed before by the media.
[02:51:49.051 --> 02:51:50.632]  You're obviously a famous filmmaker in your own right.
[02:51:51.053 --> 02:51:53.494]  And I love that score that you did on Full Metal Jacket.
[02:51:53.514 --> 02:51:54.475]  That's my favorite ever.
[02:51:54.715 --> 02:51:55.496]  That's so haunting.
[02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:16.120]  What would your dad, I know you're taking that as a question but I'd love to know, what would your dad with his great artist mind to see real reality, what would he think about what America's turned into because his films predicted it.
[02:52:17.796 --> 02:52:28.043]  Well, I was saying to you last night, I feel that my father was very haunted by those factions on this planet that tried to manipulate humanity.
[02:52:28.543 --> 02:52:35.108]  I think the films that he made, he wanted people to think for themselves, experience for themselves, whatever it meant to them.
[02:52:35.648 --> 02:52:41.332]  But I would say that if you look at every film he made, it certainly addressed all these things that we're speaking about.
[02:52:41.352 --> 02:52:43.794]  I mean, Culkuk Orange, thought control.
[02:52:45.555 --> 02:52:49.200]  You know, anti-war films, the fact that war is just pure slaughter.
[02:52:49.921 --> 02:52:53.545]  That it's got nothing to do with any of the usual things that they send people out.
[02:52:53.766 --> 02:52:54.827]  Doctor Strangelove?
[02:52:55.047 --> 02:52:55.808]  Uh, hello?
[02:52:55.828 --> 02:53:00.134]  Whole point of the doomsday machine is lost.
[02:53:02.233 --> 02:53:05.236]  If you keep it a secret, why didn't you tell the world, eh?
[02:53:06.177 --> 02:53:07.618]  Any other final points you'd like to make?
[02:53:07.638 --> 02:53:10.061]  Because those are really a lot of thought-provoking things you're saying.
[02:53:10.381 --> 02:53:11.882]  I believe there's an awakening happening.
[02:53:11.923 --> 02:53:12.323]  I see it.
[02:53:12.643 --> 02:53:13.644]  The system's scared.
[02:53:14.245 --> 02:53:17.508]  And so that's why they are really trying to suppress us.
[02:53:18.209 --> 02:53:23.334]  And it's just more key than ever that everybody start resisting in little ways, lovingly.
[02:53:23.874 --> 02:53:27.316]  But also aggressively when we have to, so there's no way they can stop all of us.
[02:53:27.396 --> 02:53:30.557]  It's essential to stop the evil from totally taking over.
[02:53:30.577 --> 02:53:34.139]  But as you can see, it's trying to take over because it can see the end is near.
[02:53:34.719 --> 02:53:47.546]  Yeah, I think the important thing that you're outlining here is that people have to learn how to confront evil and not to alter it or to lessen it and to somehow, you know, go, well, I'm sure they didn't mean to push you.
[02:53:47.846 --> 02:53:51.108]  It's like, well, you know, you need to face
[02:53:52.328 --> 02:54:00.811]  You need to confront and really properly look at what's happening and not try and explain it away or give it justifications or anything.
[02:54:00.851 --> 02:54:08.253]  Because at this juncture, we still, by our fingernails, have the chance to make a difference and turn this around.
[02:54:08.693 --> 02:54:13.295]  And to not take part and to just watch, I mean, it's a little scary.
[02:54:13.315 --> 02:54:16.136]  Believe me, I was a little scared when those sheriffs turned up.
[02:54:16.616 --> 02:54:19.337]  But if you don't stand there and push back,
[02:54:20.117 --> 02:54:29.641]  Not in a stupid, aggressive way, but if you don't push back, if you don't face it and confront it for what it is, it'll just take over, and then no one will be free.
[02:54:29.701 --> 02:54:34.503]  Well, you're right, and the power structure's made the calculation that we're cowards, we've given up, we're gonna roll over.
[02:54:34.543 --> 02:54:39.825]  They do stuff like that so people don't come out and demonstrate against wars, what happened at the G20.
[02:54:40.165 --> 02:54:43.166]  They do that so people see people being attacked, they get scared.
[02:54:43.706 --> 02:54:45.829]  So that they can then take over everybody's freedom.
[02:54:46.029 --> 02:54:48.873]  That's why you've got to go out and do this and face the fear and get through it.
[02:54:49.153 --> 02:54:51.096]  It's actually kind of fun to fight tyranny, so why not?
[02:54:51.656 --> 02:54:55.501]  So that they understand that they've miscalculated and that it's going to backfire.
[02:54:55.521 --> 02:54:58.545]  But tyrants always miscalculate, even though they have this
[02:54:59.526 --> 02:55:01.907]  Mind of God, Google, NSA, Spy Grid.
[02:55:02.088 --> 02:55:02.828]  They're not gods.
[02:55:02.868 --> 02:55:04.929]  They can't read that info.
[02:55:05.149 --> 02:55:06.170]  Because they're so evil.
[02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:10.852]  How could they, who are so unenlightened, ever think that they could read all the data they're getting?
[02:55:10.872 --> 02:55:13.594]  Because the data only shows that their system's already failing.
[02:55:15.242 --> 02:55:22.324]  I would just like to add that I think to describe it as evil is to give it certainly an adjective to describe it.
[02:55:22.344 --> 02:55:23.624]  It certainly results in evil.
[02:55:23.984 --> 02:55:28.385]  But I think the important thing is that it's an incredible degree of insanity.
[02:55:28.965 --> 02:55:34.326]  Because only insanity would breed acts that are so destructive and harmful.
[02:55:34.927 --> 02:55:44.909]  And, you know, when you think of the destruction of animals and the environment and the corporations that just seem to gaily, you know, stride forward through every decade destroying everything.
[02:55:45.009 --> 02:55:48.335]  Why aren't they even worried about Fukushima now, when it's melting down even worse?
[02:55:48.355 --> 02:55:49.176]  They don't even care anymore.
[02:55:49.196 --> 02:55:51.000]  91% of the reactors are leaking.
[02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:52.001]  Insanity!
[02:55:52.102 --> 02:55:53.504]  Look, if you're really insane...
[02:55:55.641 --> 02:56:00.025]  You have no grasp or care for what's going on and I think that's what this is.
[02:56:00.145 --> 02:56:07.252]  It's like organized insanity and I think people need to recognize that and realize there's a lot more sane people.
[02:56:07.312 --> 02:56:14.519]  I would say this probably about, you know, billions of sane people on this planet and just a very few nutters.
[02:56:15.740 --> 02:56:19.303]  And it's those nutters that have to be regulated.
[02:56:19.743 --> 02:56:27.389]  Because obviously one can't just sort of like blow them off the face of the earth, which, you know, I wish a couple of angelic beings would come along and go, ooh, you're really crazy, right?
[02:56:27.449 --> 02:56:28.450]  Off the planet you go.
[02:56:29.791 --> 02:56:31.853]  But those bad guys are here to test us.
[02:56:32.992 --> 02:56:37.953]  I have no idea, but what I would really like is regulations and laws, because those work pretty well.
[02:56:38.593 --> 02:56:43.514]  Right now we've had those laws and rights in the Constitution blown away by the, you know, Patriot Act.
[02:56:44.174 --> 02:56:46.535]  That's right, they've gotten rid of the good laws and put in all the tyranny.
[02:56:46.755 --> 02:56:54.637]  Right, and I think that we've got to try really hard and pay attention and spend an hour maybe every day looking online and, hey, let me help you.
[02:56:55.797 --> 02:56:58.558]  And actually, you know, do your research.
[02:56:58.578 --> 02:56:59.918]  You know what you're doing without equipment.
[02:57:01.319 --> 02:57:03.040]  I do, but that was just a cable.
[02:57:03.900 --> 02:57:09.583]  Anyway, I just really implore people to really just pull their finger out and do a little bit of work.
[02:57:09.623 --> 02:57:10.564]  That's your job now.
[02:57:10.864 --> 02:57:11.985]  You know, it's a new job.
[02:57:12.705 --> 02:57:19.269]  It's not enough to be a citizen because there's too much organization to dismantle your position as a citizen.
[02:57:19.289 --> 02:57:20.610]  You have to do something different now.
[02:57:21.270 --> 02:57:22.131]  Well, that's key.
[02:57:22.191 --> 02:57:26.393]  They're trying to dismantle our real citizenship and our machinery of freedom.
[02:57:26.973 --> 02:57:27.734]  And so what do we do?
[02:57:28.274 --> 02:57:54.647]  I think we actually have to take on, and this is the hard part everyone, you're going to have to operate using your own awareness, your own, you have to think for yourself, and you have to dig down deep into your soul and work up enough courage to do things about it, even if it's just, you know, sign some petitions, you listen to Alex, you know, for instance the Guardian, um, what's his face, uh, Glenn, uh, Granwell, I mean, that guy,
[02:57:55.547 --> 02:57:57.869]  They may arrest him when he gets back to the U.S.
[02:58:00.511 --> 02:58:03.193]  I don't know what to say other than it's just so insane!
[02:58:03.534 --> 02:58:05.175]  Everybody should be rallying around him.
[02:58:05.455 --> 02:58:06.576]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:58:06.696 --> 02:58:08.197]  Edward Snowden, I love you.
[02:58:08.218 --> 02:58:20.147]  I think you're an incredibly brave man and anyone who says you aren't patriotic, well, you're not thinking for yourself if you say he's not patriotic because he's actually... Look, the German government, right?
[02:58:20.407 --> 02:58:23.310]  They've all issued themselves encrypted cell phones now.
[02:58:23.570 --> 02:58:25.732]  Even their buddy pissed off at being monitored.
[02:58:25.772 --> 02:58:26.413]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:58:26.453 --> 02:58:29.195]  You get rid of checks and balances and freedom, it always blows back.
[02:58:29.475 --> 02:58:31.217]  The tyrants, you don't escape it.
[02:58:31.577 --> 02:58:36.261]  You've got to give everybody respect and liberty and freedom, because your kids have it too.
[02:58:36.581 --> 02:58:39.664]  When someone robs your neighbor's freedom, they're robbing your freedom.
[02:58:39.864 --> 02:58:55.673]  I think the important part is that everyone, regardless of your position, regardless of whether everyone that you know thinks you're a complete extremist or lunatic, the fact is... Folks, the full interview will be posted on YouTube in about 30 minutes at Infowars.com.
[02:58:55.693 --> 02:58:56.894]  We're going into overdrive.
[02:58:57.394 --> 02:59:00.235]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, but that's part of the live interview.
[02:59:00.256 --> 02:59:06.219]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard
[02:59:06.619 --> 02:59:09.001]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[02:59:09.101 --> 02:59:09.402]  The U.S.
[02:59:09.462 --> 02:59:13.606]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[02:59:13.706 --> 02:59:16.288]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[02:59:16.669 --> 02:59:17.910]  They want that attack to come.
[02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:24.336]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[02:59:24.736 --> 02:59:27.200]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[02:59:27.400 --> 02:59:32.186]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[02:59:32.367 --> 02:59:39.817]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[02:59:40.117 --> 02:59:42.659]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[02:59:42.879 --> 02:59:45.521]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[02:59:45.981 --> 02:59:50.245]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[02:59:55.949 --> 03:00:01.633]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:01.993 --> 03:00:03.374]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:04.055 --> 03:00:07.257]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.212 --> 03:00:14.873]  Big Brother.
[03:00:15.534 --> 03:00:16.555]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:17.296 --> 03:00:18.378]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:19.059 --> 03:00:19.860]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.641 --> 03:00:21.562]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.183 --> 03:00:25.828]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.389 --> 03:00:30.454]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.596 --> 03:00:36.142]  Alright, if you just joined us, we just aired most of the Vivian Kubrick interview.
[03:00:36.843 --> 03:00:47.238]  I had told the crew to cut almost all of me out, because I'd been on the air about four hours at that point, in the freezing cold, and when I get tired, I really start going, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, because that's like how I say, uh.
[03:00:48.705 --> 03:00:53.488]  But we're going to put that out on YouTube in the next 30 minutes at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:53.788 --> 03:01:05.835]  If you're a radio listener and want to be able to go see it in high-def, we'll have that interesting interview and also some more of the high-def footage of the police attacking us that no one's seen yet, that will be posted.
[03:01:06.716 --> 03:01:11.538]  That had aired live in overdrive, but just the audio, and it had been breaking up some.
[03:01:11.558 --> 03:01:15.441]  So it's high-def audio, high-def video, premiering that here, that interview.
[03:01:16.582 --> 03:01:24.251]  And if I can ever get her to come to town and talk about all the other stuff and all the amazing Hollywood stuff she was telling me about how she tried to stop animal abuse in Hollywood.
[03:01:24.271 --> 03:01:30.018]  If you go to DrudgeReport.com today, that's like the top story is all about
[03:01:32.233 --> 03:01:38.379]  Spielberg again, and animals dying or getting hurt on his movies.
[03:01:38.399 --> 03:01:51.931]  27 animal deaths on The Hobbit, Hollywood Reporter, A Life of Pi, Tiger, Damn Near Drowned, Dog Punch, repeatedly unpopular Disney movie, secret email documents exposed, Spielberg protected by cover-up, war horse death, more.
[03:01:51.951 --> 03:01:56.235]  And man, she was telling me about, and that's on record, she did that about Spielberg.
[03:01:57.516 --> 03:02:05.784]  And about animal deaths and just how they tried to cover it up, but so I can talk about that.
[03:02:07.746 --> 03:02:13.671]  But it's just funny she was talking to me about that a lot privately and then now it's a big story today in the news.
[03:02:14.051 --> 03:02:16.574]  Movies, TV awash, and hidden animal abuse.
[03:02:18.439 --> 03:02:20.341]  In the old days, they're going to have a horse battle or whatever.
[03:02:20.361 --> 03:02:22.564]  They just run the horses actually off the real cliff to die.
[03:02:22.944 --> 03:02:25.467]  And I am against the abuse of sentient animals.
[03:02:26.448 --> 03:02:35.037]  My issue is, is that it then turns into a total anti-human movement and isn't used to actually even protect animals.
[03:02:35.097 --> 03:02:37.220]  But everybody I know loves whales and
[03:02:39.557 --> 03:02:42.239]  Giraffes and things like elephants.
[03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:47.743]  But the larger issue is I don't want the animal movement to turn into an anti-human movement.
[03:02:48.363 --> 03:02:52.907]  I said I'd go into overdrive to take your phone calls and I appreciate everybody holding.
[03:02:53.908 --> 03:02:56.329]  I'll see how many I can get to right now and then I've got to end it.
[03:02:56.369 --> 03:02:59.512]  I apologize because my voice is going out from this weekend screaming.
[03:03:00.973 --> 03:03:02.494]  Let's talk to Kathy in Texas.
[03:03:02.534 --> 03:03:03.715]  You were at the JFK protest.
[03:03:03.735 --> 03:03:04.515]  Do you want to talk about it?
[03:03:04.555 --> 03:03:04.896]  Go ahead.
[03:03:05.716 --> 03:03:06.517]  Excellent, Alex.
[03:03:07.233 --> 03:03:07.633]  Excellent.
[03:03:07.974 --> 03:03:17.899]  And it was heartening to witness, see the brave and beautiful men, women, and children out there standing up against tyranny.
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:23.882]  Also, I want to thank you to the outstanding InfoWars crew.
[03:03:25.443 --> 03:03:35.409]  And if Sheriff Bob is up there and that probably needs to reevaluate her oath and commitment to the US Constitution.
[03:03:36.941 --> 03:03:42.346]  And I want to wish you and all InfoWarriors out there a Happy Thanksgiving.
[03:03:42.926 --> 03:03:44.968]  And God bless you in the name of Jesus.
[03:03:45.248 --> 03:03:46.229]  Thank you very much, Kathy.
[03:03:46.249 --> 03:03:46.869]  We're going to jump.
[03:03:46.889 --> 03:03:51.093]  Kathy had beautiful words, but man, her phone had that perfect frequency.
[03:03:51.653 --> 03:03:53.395]  My dad's cell phone does that.
[03:03:54.685 --> 03:03:57.647]  And it's almost like migrating voice, but times ten.
[03:03:58.168 --> 03:04:00.189]  Like a little bit of it is endearing, I guess.
[03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:04.613]  But a lot of it is, wow, you could put me in a torture chamber with that.
[03:04:04.993 --> 03:04:07.355]  And again, it wasn't her voice.
[03:04:08.136 --> 03:04:12.019]  It was the perfect, just like, like a laser beam of sound.
[03:04:12.359 --> 03:04:13.360]  Telephones can do that.
[03:04:14.921 --> 03:04:16.862]  Chris in Georgia, we've only got about a minute, go ahead.
[03:04:16.882 --> 03:04:19.705]  Hi Alex, how's my cell phone doing?
[03:04:20.325 --> 03:04:22.387]  Very soft and wonderful, very heavenly.
[03:04:24.573 --> 03:04:27.496]  Alright, listen, I got another mild, mild criticism.
[03:04:28.216 --> 03:04:28.617]  Okay.
[03:04:28.697 --> 03:04:39.525]  You know, you're talking always about the dumbed-down populace and a portion of the American people that are waking up with low right heads and all that.
[03:04:39.545 --> 03:04:44.770]  Well, you know, you realize those are not the people that you're talking to on your show.
[03:04:46.491 --> 03:04:49.794]  The people that get on your show are not those people.
[03:04:51.634 --> 03:04:53.457]  No, I know, but I'm not talking about you.
[03:04:53.477 --> 03:04:54.178]  I always say that.
[03:04:54.538 --> 03:04:56.681]  I'm talking about these are victims.
[03:04:56.721 --> 03:04:57.843]  We shouldn't even be mad at them.
[03:04:58.103 --> 03:04:59.324]  We need to reach out to them.
[03:05:00.126 --> 03:05:03.690]  And the people I'm really mad at are people that are aware of all this and are just using it for power.
[03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:04.191]  But I hear you.
[03:05:04.491 --> 03:05:05.212]  I apologize.
[03:05:05.252 --> 03:05:06.173]  I'll try to be more clear.
[03:05:06.454 --> 03:05:07.095]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:09.704 --> 03:05:20.075]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[03:05:20.376 --> 03:05:22.238]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[03:05:22.438 --> 03:05:23.139]  Fluoride!
[03:05:23.339 --> 03:05:25.601]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[03:05:25.761 --> 03:05:29.866]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt production.
