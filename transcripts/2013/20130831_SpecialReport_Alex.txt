[00:00:11.823 --> 00:00:12.924]  My name's Ben Kessler.
[00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:14.584]  I was in the Marine Corps from 2002 to 2006.
[00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:19.167]  I was infantry, served in Afghanistan in 2004.
[00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:23.369]  I'm out here today because I don't want to see us starting a war in Syria.
[00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:30.632]  I'm Dr. Laura Presley and I'm out here for the rally against the war in Syria that President Obama has been proposing.
[00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:35.295]  Proper action for us to take is to help in a diplomatic process.
[00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:39.337]  I mean there's a lot of different options that don't involve
[00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:46.028]  Bombing or sending troops to Syria and all of those options are better than the military options
[00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:54.363]  This president needs to remember that he was awarded the Peace Prize his first term and that war is not peace.
[00:00:55.064 --> 00:01:09.988]  And yesterday I called Cornyn's office, Senator Ted Cruz's office, and Representative Congressman Mike McCaul's office and said they need to be taking a leadership role here in the state of Texas and hold President Obama accountable for this.
[00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:10.788]  The U.S.
[00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.931]  can never be a force for good in intervening throughout the world, especially in the Middle East.
[00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:21.253]  And this seems to be a transparent attempt by the U.S.
[00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:28.796]  to put in someone friendly to serve as a bulwark against the Arab revolutions that have been going on since really 2011.
[00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:34.159]  It's coming out in the mainstream press, let alone the alternative media, that these
[00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:46.024]  Rebels that we're supposedly supporting are, in fact, Al-Qaeda, and it's the rebels that are launching the chemical weapons, which is supposedly the justification that why we're going in the first place.
[00:01:46.764 --> 00:01:50.826]  It's the rebels and not the Assad regime that have launched chemical weapons.
[00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:59.610]  Yesterday, the United States presented a powerful case that the Syrian government was responsible for this attack on its own people.
[00:02:01.018 --> 00:02:15.908]  Our intelligence shows the Assad regime and its forces preparing to use chemical weapons, launching rockets in the highly populated suburbs of Damascus, and acknowledging that a chemical weapons attack took place.
[00:02:16.568 --> 00:02:17.409]  They have no evidence.
[00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:18.730]  There's nothing.
[00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.870]  All I've heard is
[00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:28.296]  Trying to put blame on them and absolutely no hard facts so I'm not buying it.
[00:02:28.897 --> 00:02:36.387]  All the just wars that we've been having lately Afghanistan Iraq and
[00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:51.217]  I mean, there is a little thing, well it's not little, but there is a thing going on in Syria of them hurting their own people, but that doesn't mean America has to just come and meddle with it.
[00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:55.761]  I mean, we're always, like, just minding other people's business.
[00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.843]  Like, we're always getting into other people's business.
[00:02:59.284 --> 00:03:07.825]  That's probably why we get into so many wars, and I think if we just mind our own business, then this world would just be so much of a better place.
[00:03:13.052 --> 00:03:16.694]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:03:16.915 --> 00:03:22.198]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:29.823]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:03:30.163 --> 00:03:39.269]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.471]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:49.512]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:56.454]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:00.147]  State of Mind.
[00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:01.790]  Because there's a war on.
[00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.751]  For your mind.
