[00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:14.928]  We're looking forward to having our ACL visitors come out from around the world.
[00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:16.128]  We're ready.
[00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:16.988]  We're open for business.
[00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:17.708]  It's a great event.
[00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:22.350]  But it's important that when you're at ACL, you need to be our eyes and ears.
[00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.651]  You know what's happening around the globe with some of the issues with homegrown and foreign grown extremists.
[00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:33.452]  If you see somebody acting suspicious, if it's 90 degrees out and somebody's wearing a big old coat,
[00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.043]  Huge backpack coming towards ACL.
[00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:37.984]  You might want to call the police so we can check out.
[00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:39.185]  That's kind of suspicious to me.
[00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:50.632]  If you see somebody leave something somewhere unattended, treat ACL, treat any place that's a place that's heavily populated or heavily being attended with large gathering of people.
[00:00:51.073 --> 00:00:52.353]  Treat it like you would an airport.
[00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:56.796]  Is it about time that we're going to hear something about Eugene Jackson?
[00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:58.137]  When is it that you anticipate?
[00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.338]  I've already put out a press release on that.
[00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.100]  We are done with our administrative investigation.
[00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.393]  We are on track with that investigation.
[00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:05.833]  It's done.
[00:01:06.653 --> 00:01:19.177]  The criminal investigation is in the District Attorney's hands and I've already put her on notice and put the community on notice that we will move forward administratively to finish our piece of it from the administrative side the first week of November.
[00:01:19.317 --> 00:01:19.857]  Thank you.
[00:01:20.317 --> 00:01:20.817]  Thanks guys.
[00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:22.698]  I have one question Chief.
[00:01:22.878 --> 00:01:23.698]  Is this you or Alex?
[00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:24.418]  This is me.
[00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:32.561]  Every time I go out to these rallies and these protests, you know, I went to one, I believe you were out of town, they had a fire Acevedo rally and one of the things they're always
[00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:34.342]  I'm not quite sure what you're talking about.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.502]  I am in my apartment sir.
[00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:00.643]  You're back inside right now?
[00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:01.524]  I am inside.
[00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:11.618]  Well you know when a SWAT team is making entry into a house or we're making an entry into certain locations depending on who the person is sometimes we have entry of undercover officers that are involved.
[00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:14.659]  And there's a specific need, tactical need.
[00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:23.926]  If there's a tactical need that relates to safety, we're never going to pass a policy that prohibits them from taking measures that they need to be safe on their parts.
[00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:28.389]  Well, what type of measures would they be taking that they need to wear a mask?
[00:02:29.604 --> 00:02:35.030]  I just told you undercover officers need to protect their identity and so sometimes they'll have to do that.
[00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.152]  Thank you.
[00:02:36.252 --> 00:02:36.772]  Thanks guys.
[00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:38.114]  Say hi to Alex for me.
[00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:38.814]  Thank you.
[00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:39.395]  See you guys.
[00:02:39.715 --> 00:02:40.416]  This is my door.
[00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:41.978]  I'm standing right inside my apartment.
[00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:44.821]  Sir, I'm inside my apartment.
[00:02:45.522 --> 00:02:47.484]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:02:47.524 --> 00:02:48.064]  It's here.
[00:02:48.745 --> 00:02:51.028]  Who are they going to fight a war against?
[00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:59.502]  I'm Darren McBreen and these are some of the new items that are available now at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:05.085]  Alert the public to Obama's blatant abuse of power with the new Obama t-shirt.
[00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:08.887]  Obama's joker face on the front and come and take it on the back.
[00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:13.029]  It's time to publicly call him out for what he is, a tyrant.
[00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.991]  Defend the second amendment with our top seller come and take it t-shirt.
[00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:21.233]  And look at that, women's cut tank tops and t-shirts now available.

[00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:24.214]  Plus, the Don't Tread On Me flag.
