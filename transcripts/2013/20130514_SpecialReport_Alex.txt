[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:03.191]  My name is Michelle Prescott, and I'm the founder of Texan Gun Rights.
[00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:06.893]  And I'm Tammy Koontz, and I am the co-founder of Texan Gun Rights.
[00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:12.055]  This event here today, this is about getting our legislators to do what they need to do.
[00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:18.139]  They need to get these bills out of the committee, onto the House floor, so that we can have a vote.
[00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.160]  HB 700, which is the open carry bill.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:35.369]  We have Senate Bill 182, which is the campus carry bill, and also HB 3218, which is really a biggie because that one, in a sense, would null and void all gun-free zones across the state of Texas.
[00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.691]  My name is Drew Sprayer from Munster, Texas, House District 68.
[00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:44.614]  I authored House Bill 3218, which deals with CHLs anywhere.
[00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:49.957]  Meaning, if you have your CHL, you should be able to carry concealed anywhere in the state of Texas.
[00:00:50.418 --> 00:00:50.518]  Yes.
[00:00:50.578 --> 00:00:51.018]  I think so.
[00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:05.227]  Again, it's an infringement issue and he's free to do anything else he wants with that technology.
[00:01:05.407 --> 00:01:14.435]  When it comes to the 3D printable firearm, technology needs to keep up with what's happening and the police, they need to keep up with what's going on.
[00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:17.316]  And they can't keep up, and that's on them.
[00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:18.517]  What are they going to do?
[00:01:18.597 --> 00:01:23.819]  It was downloaded like 100,000 times, and it's on 23,000 different websites.
[00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.020]  I mean, there's no way of stopping it now.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.422]  The printable is so new right now that we don't really know what's going on.
[00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:38.305]  But my understanding is that that is actually going to be more expensive to actually do that at home than to go buy it again at a gun store.
[00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:44.168]  Well, were you aware that Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez said in a recent speech that he wants to make the gun ban legitimate?
[00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:50.718]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.165]  But, because of the work that we're doing here today,
[00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:58.248]  We will make your side legitimate shortly.
[00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:08.010]  I saw the YouTube of that and it made me want to get in my car and drive down here and just try and talk some sense into him.
[00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.891]  But at that point when a person is that far gone, there really is no talking any sense to them.
[00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:14.191]  He can't do that.
[00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:17.972]  That was settled in 1795.
[00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:20.832]  We've already fought for that gun right.
[00:02:20.972 --> 00:02:21.912]  I think it's silly.
[00:02:21.992 --> 00:02:25.133]  I think everywhere you look from the FBI statistics to
[00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:30.677]  Just comparing places that have gun bans shows that they don't work.
[00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:37.181]  Councilman Martinez needs to focus his attention on relieving traffic off of I-35 and keep his hands off of our Second Amendment rights.
[00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:39.102]  We want to vote now!
[00:02:39.162 --> 00:02:40.843]  We want to vote now!
[00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:42.064]  We want to vote!
[00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:43.745]  We want to vote!
[00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:45.986]  We want to vote now!
[00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:47.627]  We want to vote now!
[00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:50.167]  Now did you know that on July 4th in Washington, D.C.
[00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:55.368]  they're going to have an armed march with people carrying loaded, I stress loaded rifles strapped to their backs?
[00:02:55.448 --> 00:02:55.948]  Yes, I do.
[00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:59.369]  How do you feel about that and would you participate in something like that if you could?
[00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.330]  I'm not going to say whether I'd participate about it.
[00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.011]  I've been thinking it over in my head, but I do support it.
[00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:06.812]  It takes a certain type of people to make that type of message.
[00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:10.873]  I think Adam Kokesh and all his supporters are the right type of people.
[00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:13.254]  I'm interested in going to Washington, D.C.
[00:03:13.314 --> 00:03:14.354]  I don't know about the ammo.
[00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:16.595]  The Constitution says we can carry weapons.
[00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:18.015]  It doesn't say loaded or unloaded.
[00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:20.676]  But I prefer not to go loaded.
[00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:23.676]  I feel we should be able to carry him anywhere at any time.
[00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:28.578]  However, this particular situation you're talking about, if I could participate, I would.
[00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.178]  I'm currently not able to, but I support everyone doing it.
[00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.919]  I'm in the same boat.
[00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.900]  I mean, as far as I feel about it, loaded, unloaded, what difference does it really make?
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.001]  You know, in the same boat as him, if I could go, I would.
[00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:43.907]  If you're going to carry it, they should be loaded.
[00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:44.748]  They have a purpose.
[00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:47.550]  They deserve that purpose, although safely.
[00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:53.875]  However, I am very interested and I will be watching the Washington event very closely.
[00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:56.497]  Some things need to change, and it's time to change.
[00:03:57.258 --> 00:03:58.659]  You can only afford to lose freedom one time.
