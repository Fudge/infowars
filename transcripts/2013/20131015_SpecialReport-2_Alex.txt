[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:02.310]  Welcome to Tyranny Watch, I'm Gigi Ornetta.
[00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.931]  Well, our government's on the warpath again, and topping today's bad list is toilets.
[00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:09.011]  You heard me right.
[00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:12.712]  They won't allow toilets to be delivered to the World War II Memorial.
[00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:17.514]  They won't allow porter potties to be delivered to the World War II Memorial in Washington DC.
[00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:18.234]  A truck got
[00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:24.659]  But there were a load of port-a-potties that were donated by private citizens to help out the visiting veterans since the facilities are closed.
[00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:32.905]  The Nazi Park Service rangers wouldn't allow the port-a-potties to be dropped off, not even in the Grassy area where their 10 vehicles were already parked.
[00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:38.130]  Park rangers at the World War II memorial say the park is closed except for First Amendment activities.
[00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.494]  The government's shutdown-related closure of the memorial sparked outrage from citizens and lawmakers.
[00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:49.939]  Veterans who first breached barriers around the memorial last week were allowed access on First Amendment grounds.
[00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:57.245]  The sign says due to the federal government shutdown, this National Park Service area is closed except for First Amendment activities.
[00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:01.248]  So some patriots are claiming their First Amendment rights and heading right on in.
[00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:06.892]  Biscayne National Park will not be open for Columbus Day festivities this year because of the federal government shutdown.
[00:01:06.912 --> 00:01:10.135]  We're encouraging people to stay away from the park because officially it is closed.
[00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:12.937]  We're going to try and manage that as best we can with all of our federal partners.
[00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:16.162]  So no partying, but the regatta will go on as usual.
[00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:17.865]  Well, there is some good news.
[00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:21.831]  The IRS will suspend audit activities during the shutdown.
[00:01:22.392 --> 00:01:23.113]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:01:23.213 --> 00:01:25.698]  They'll be back after the shutdown to claim their money.
[00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.045]  I'm Gigi Ornette for Tyranny Watch on the InfoWars Nightly News.
