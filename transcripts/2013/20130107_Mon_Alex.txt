[00:00:02.728 --> 00:00:06.912]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:08.374]  You want answers?
[00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:10.055]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:14.259]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.964]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:27.550]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, January 7th, 2013.
[00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:33.476]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, sitting in for Alex today.
[00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:44.045]  We have an amazing show lined up for you for the next three hours, and the reason I'm here is because Alex is on a plane headed to New York.
[00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:49.330]  He's going to appear on the CNN broadcast tonight, I think it's at...
[00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:55.455]  What, nine, nine, eight o'clock, no, nine central, eight eastern, I think is what it is, right?
[00:00:56.515 --> 00:01:00.218]  Anyway, Alex is going to be there with Piers Morgan, so we'll see how that goes.
[00:01:00.898 --> 00:01:08.744]  So I'm here covering for Alex today, and he called me before the show with some somewhat disturbing news as well.
[00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:14.487]  He has been detained and nearly arrested at the Austin airport.
[00:01:15.368 --> 00:01:18.070]  And he's going to be uploading a video later.
[00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:34.540]  That will explain what happened, and I'm not going to go into any details right now, but he was very angry about how he's being treated as an American citizen just trying to get on an airplane.
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.561]  In any case, that's coming up later tonight.
[00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:41.862]  That'll probably make the InfoWars Nightly News, but in the meantime, let's continue.
[00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:43.882]  We've got some great guests coming up for you today.
[00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:56.826]  We've got Mark Baker from BakersGreenAcres.com joining us at the bottom of this hour with an update on how the state of Michigan has been forcing farmers there to shoot their own pigs.
[00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:05.803]  And now an economic embargo of sorts has been enacted against Mark Baker and other farmers there.
[00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:10.127]  It's an all-out economic warfare against American patriots, okay?
[00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:17.835]  So anybody who tries to grow their own food, who tries to farm, who tries to exercise any kind of freedom whatsoever, whether it's free speech,
[00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:21.018]  Food freedom, medical freedom, health freedom, you name it.
[00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.683]  They're all being assaulted, attacked at every angle imaginable.
[00:02:26.403 --> 00:02:26.884]  It's on!
[00:02:27.324 --> 00:02:34.011]  The war is on against the American patriots and Mark Baker will be joining us with some more details on what's going on there.
[00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:45.594]  Also, in the next hour, we've got John Rappaport joining us with some breaking realizations about psychiatric drugs and how now these could be used.
[00:02:46.094 --> 00:02:51.195]  You see, the government has a record of prescription drugs.
[00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:53.375]  Who's been prescribed all of these?
[00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.976]  It's a patient database of prescription records.
[00:02:56.836 --> 00:03:02.901]  And this database not only has your name in it, but also what you've been prescribed.
[00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:17.152]  So if you're taking antidepressant drugs, if you're taking mind-altering psychiatric drugs, if your children are taking drugs for ADHD or depression or anything, this is all being recorded by the government.
[00:03:18.113 --> 00:03:24.318]  And now that we've got new gun control, a new push, of course, happening in the Senate, thanks to people like Feinstein,
[00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:32.362]  Your prescription drug records could be used to deny you your constitutional rights.
[00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:51.893]  All they have to do is claim that everyone who's taking antidepressant drugs is now, quote, mentally unfit to own a firearm, or to even perhaps invoke their Fifth Amendment rights, or their First Amendment rights, or basically they can just say, if you're taking these drugs, the Bill of Rights no longer applies to you.
[00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.831]  That's what they can say.
[00:03:54.211 --> 00:04:00.477]  So that is a very worrisome realization and a possible development in this gun control issue.
[00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:03.459]  And John Rappaport will be joining us to go over that.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.863]  We've also got Richard Pearson popping in in the next hour.
[00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:17.852]  He is the head of the Illinois State Rifle Association that just narrowly defeated yet another sneak attack gun control bill last night.
[00:04:18.573 --> 00:04:20.634]  Yeah, they're trying it at all hours now.
[00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:35.743]  It's like, I guess these lawmakers are staying up until 3 in the morning on a Sunday night to try to sneak a bill through that is completely unconstitutional, that would criminalize all citizens of Illinois who own firearms
[00:04:36.383 --> 00:04:41.947]  It would criminalize the farmers and the ranchers and everyone in that state who legally owns firearms.
[00:04:42.307 --> 00:04:44.128]  But that bill was narrowly defeated last night.
[00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:47.090]  We'll get an update on that issue in the next hour.
[00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.212]  So stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:49.672 --> 00:04:51.573]  All of that and much more straight ahead.
[00:04:51.613 --> 00:04:52.294]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.140]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:07.384]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:07.404 --> 00:05:09.625]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:09.645 --> 00:05:15.089]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.754]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:22.174 --> 00:05:27.717]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:28.117 --> 00:05:31.799]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.321]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:42.084]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:45.546]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:46.107 --> 00:05:47.547]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:48.088 --> 00:05:48.508]  It's here.

[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.582]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:06:31.882 --> 00:06:35.065]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:37.047]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[00:06:37.187 --> 00:06:39.269]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.011]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:43.453]  It's what my family uses.

[00:08:05.608 --> 00:08:07.770]  You better believe you got one!
[00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:14.475]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:16.497]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.226 --> 00:08:31.488]  All right, we are live on this Monday, January 7th, yes, 2013.
[00:08:31.548 --> 00:08:45.713]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex Jones, who right now is on an airplane headed to New York to be on CNN tonight, the Piers Morgan Show.
[00:08:45.853 --> 00:08:54.597]  Apparently Alex is going to be there live sitting with Mr. Morgan, Mr. Redcoat Morgan, the guy that
[00:08:55.757 --> 00:09:02.118]  That was a big successful petition calling for Morgan to be detained and kicked out of the country.
[00:09:02.278 --> 00:09:04.559]  That's a pretty good petition.
[00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:10.660]  But anyway, Alex is going to be sitting in there with him to have something that I'm sure will be a very mild conversation.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.941]  And Alex, and by the way, that's going to be aired at, I think, let's see, let me get this right, 9 p.m.
[00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:19.002]  Eastern and 8 p.m.
[00:09:19.122 --> 00:09:19.462]  Central.
[00:09:20.322 --> 00:09:21.943]  So I guess that makes it 6 p.m.
[00:09:22.203 --> 00:09:23.004]  Pacific, right?
[00:09:23.124 --> 00:09:23.724]  Did I get that right?
[00:09:24.024 --> 00:09:24.905]  I can do math today.
[00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:26.066]  What a wonderful Monday.
[00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:30.670]  Yeah, normally the math doesn't work till Tuesdays, right?
[00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:33.472]  Okay, so we have a lot of news coming up today.
[00:09:33.652 --> 00:09:41.997]  Obviously the attack is on at every level, at every angle, on all Americans who believe in the Bill of Rights, who believe in the Second Amendment especially.
[00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:44.898]  And we've got a number of guests coming on today.
[00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:48.520]  Let me give you the rundown of what you're going to hear here for the next three hours.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.882]  This is going to be an amazingly hard-hitting show.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:10:10.489]  At the bottom of this hour we've got Mark Baker coming on from Baker's Green Acres talking about the state of Michigan and how they are now putting an economic embargo on home small farmers who are trying to have a small family farm raising heirloom pigs, basically, and are being shut down by the state of Michigan.
[00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:16.212]  I know we've covered that issue before, but we have new information, new updates, and a worsening of the situation.
[00:10:17.307 --> 00:10:19.469]  So Mark will be here to give us that breakdown.
[00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:33.644]  Then the next hour we've got John Rappaport from NoMoreFakeNews.com joining us to give us more details on some additional breaking realizations that we had about the psychiatric prescription, patient prescription drug list.
[00:10:34.305 --> 00:10:36.987]  Look, the government is running a surveillance database
[00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:41.749]  On all the drugs that you are prescribed and purchased from pharmacies.
[00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.151]  That database could be turned into a no-gun-by database.
[00:10:47.651 --> 00:10:52.213]  They could just say, they can invoke this by executive order as has been admitted.
[00:10:52.233 --> 00:11:01.696]  The Washington Post over the weekend ran a story saying Obama was looking at executive order to just mandate new gun restrictions and one of those
[00:11:02.236 --> 00:11:23.798]  This wasn't in the Washington Post article, but this is in our article at Natural News, and it's posted on Infowars.com this morning, shows that that drug database could be copied and pasted into the NoGunBuy database, which essentially is the FBI instant background check system, NICS, to deny people the right to buy firearms who have been on antidepressants.
[00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:24.979]  So...
[00:11:26.112 --> 00:11:26.733]  That's coming up.
[00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:40.703]  That's a very big, important discussion because it means that if you are taking psychiatric drugs, which includes antidepressants and other classes of prescribed pharmaceuticals, you could be denied your constitutional rights.
[00:11:41.543 --> 00:11:50.429]  Outside of law, just with a regulation, this would not even require senators or members of the House to vote for any new law.
[00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:51.891]  It wouldn't require anything at all.
[00:11:52.771 --> 00:12:02.401]  Just one stroke of the pen, or one stroke of the robotic pen from Obama, who doesn't even sign his own laws anymore, just has a robot do it.
[00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:02.922]  Hey, why not?
[00:12:03.162 --> 00:12:04.924]  He's a puppet anyway, just have a puppet sign it.
[00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:10.242]  Um, grab a puppet with a pen and sign the laws that way.
[00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.563]  Alright, here's some other news.
[00:12:11.603 --> 00:12:13.044]  We've got welfare recipients.
[00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:14.144]  This is out of the New York Post.
[00:12:14.665 --> 00:12:21.109]  Welfare recipients take out cash at strip clubs, liquor stores, and X-rated shops.
[00:12:21.169 --> 00:12:25.852]  This was an exclusive story that broke on the New York Post over the weekend.
[00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:31.756]  And it turns out that if you track where these recipients are taking out their cash,
[00:12:33.797 --> 00:12:39.801]  They're taking out all their, you know, with their EBT cards, their government paid welfare cards.
[00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:49.807]  They're taking it out at porn shops, hookah parlors, I've never heard that term before, a hookah parlor, and even strip clubs.
[00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:54.150]  Man, I must be out of the loop on that whole realm because I've never even heard of a hookah parlor.
[00:12:56.071 --> 00:13:00.214]  Anyway, I have heard of strip clubs, so that's where they're taking out their money and using it.
[00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:01.855]  So this is your money, folks.
[00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:03.997]  This is your taxpayer money.
[00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:16.486]  When you go to work and you pay taxes, or they take it out actually, they sort of confiscate taxes from you, and they're confiscating more now than ever before, thanks to the fiscal cliff negotiations.
[00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:23.572]  That money goes to these Obama-supporting EBT card owners who are using your money
[00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:30.181]  To get it on at X-rated porn shops and strip clubs.
[00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:45.327]  Oh man, how insane has it become when our tax dollars go to fund the compassionate welfare of people who use your money to hire strippers and buy porn?
[00:13:47.028 --> 00:13:51.769]  Yeah, that's called welfare in the new United States of America.
[00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:53.150]  Enough on that, let's move on.
[00:13:55.458 --> 00:14:00.160]  Large cities all over America are degenerating into gang-infested war zones.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.821]  This is by Michael Snyder at Economic Collapse.
[00:14:03.481 --> 00:14:05.902]  And it's posted on InfoWars.com as well.
[00:14:06.522 --> 00:14:13.365]  And in this article he looks at the large cities and how they're breaking down into total criminal gang-infested chaos.
[00:14:14.185 --> 00:14:26.191]  And there was a story posted on Drudge over the weekend where a woman in Detroit called 9-1-1, reported that her car had been stolen and a firearm inside the car had obviously been stolen with the car.
[00:14:27.091 --> 00:14:31.133]  And the police or 9-1-1 told her, uh, call back later.
[00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:33.494]  Call back later.
[00:14:33.514 --> 00:14:34.094]  Yeah.
[00:14:35.755 --> 00:14:37.136]  Welcome to the suicide hotline.
[00:14:37.236 --> 00:14:37.776]  Please hold.
[00:14:38.736 --> 00:14:39.277]  It's like,
[00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:42.358]  Forget about police in Detroit now.
[00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:48.660]  Didn't the police of Detroit even announce a few weeks ago for people not to even enter the city?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.421]  Because if you dial 911, we can't help you.
[00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:52.782]  We can't even help you.
[00:14:53.202 --> 00:14:55.463]  You know, this reminds me of the movie RoboCop.
[00:14:55.483 --> 00:14:56.003]  Remember that?
[00:14:56.183 --> 00:14:58.424]  The original RoboCop movie from the 1980s?
[00:14:58.644 --> 00:15:03.626]  You gotta go back and watch RoboCop because that was based in Detroit.
[00:15:04.366 --> 00:15:12.910]  And in the movie, the city of Detroit had degenerated into a total corporate gang crime zone, where the corporations were running the drugs.
[00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.391]  Ah, guess what's happened today?
[00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:15.471]  Exactly like that.
[00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:23.495]  The commercials in that movie, RoboCop, were so ridiculous then, they seemed outlandish, and today, they are true.
[00:15:24.255 --> 00:15:28.217]  It's, it's, that movie was, it really foreshadowed the future.
[00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:32.482]  And this is happening in cities all across the country.
[00:15:32.602 --> 00:15:32.982]  East St.
[00:15:33.022 --> 00:15:49.986]  Louis, Detroit, L.A., East L.A., you name it, it is all degenerating as... But look, you can't blame the police on this because the men and women in blue who are out there trying to do their jobs, and I know this because I've worked with these cops firsthand,
[00:15:50.566 --> 00:15:51.727]  They are trying to do their jobs.
[00:15:52.047 --> 00:15:54.868]  They are ridiculously underfunded.
[00:15:55.388 --> 00:16:00.710]  They are not given even enough money to buy the ammo that they need to police their local cities.
[00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.952]  They're denied their own gear in many cases.
[00:16:03.972 --> 00:16:15.836]  Hey, when I was working with the police in Arizona, we were raising money so they could buy their own bulletproof vest because the PD there didn't even give them bulletproof vests.
[00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:19.458]  Imagine being a cop and having to buy your own vest.
[00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:21.660]  It's ridiculous.
[00:16:22.722 --> 00:16:23.382]  But this is true.
[00:16:23.863 --> 00:16:33.457]  So as a result, as a result of the cuts, as a result of the insanity, the cops are being downsized everywhere and of course the gangs are running completely out of control.
[00:16:34.775 --> 00:16:46.805]  Now, here's another great article that I saw over the weekend from WorldNetDaily by the managing editor of WorldNetDaily, David Kopelian.
[00:16:47.526 --> 00:16:48.286]  This is a great story.
[00:16:48.346 --> 00:16:51.469]  The giant gaping hole in Sandy Hook reporting.
[00:16:52.370 --> 00:17:00.877]  And in the story, that's up at worldnetdaily.com, WND, he covers the mainstream media
[00:17:02.031 --> 00:17:07.355]  They're refusing to cover the psychiatric drugs and their links to violent shooting and suicides.
[00:17:07.395 --> 00:17:15.260]  And he runs down what we've been reporting on for years at Natural News, which is the link between psych drugs and violent shootings.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:22.565]  If you go back to Columbine, those kids that shot up their classmates and shot up their school, they were taking antidepressant drugs.
[00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:31.551]  If you run down the whole list, most school shootings and most violent outbursts, even in the military, the military violence that's happened,
[00:17:33.392 --> 00:17:35.973]  What was the shooting at Fort Hood?
[00:17:36.493 --> 00:17:38.274]  That guy was under psychiatric care.
[00:17:38.754 --> 00:17:40.455]  All of these people are under psychiatric care.
[00:17:40.635 --> 00:17:41.955]  You look at Aurora, Colorado.
[00:17:41.995 --> 00:17:45.357]  You look at Sandy Hook in Connecticut, the recent situation.
[00:17:45.377 --> 00:17:47.038]  That guy was on psychiatric drugs.
[00:17:47.718 --> 00:17:50.699]  It is the link that the media refuses to report.
[00:17:51.159 --> 00:17:54.761]  They want to focus on, oh, the guns are bad.
[00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:57.822]  They don't want to tell you that the guy left his AR-15 rifle in the car.
[00:17:59.483 --> 00:18:00.805]  He didn't even bring it into the school.
[00:18:01.005 --> 00:18:02.587]  They don't want to tell you that he was on psych drugs.
[00:18:02.607 --> 00:18:05.350]  They don't want to tell you that all these people are Satan worshippers.
[00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:12.498]  That they're all these goth-like characters who literally love the devil, love Satan, or think they do.
[00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.942]  They probably never even, they don't even know what they're really dealing with.
[00:18:16.863 --> 00:18:18.324]  But they think they love Satan.
[00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:21.352]  And so they engage in this kind of behavior.
[00:18:21.672 --> 00:18:24.853]  In any case, check out that article at world.dailywnd.com.
[00:18:24.993 --> 00:18:25.433]  Good article.
[00:18:26.093 --> 00:18:33.716]  Next item, this is up at infowars.com by Mark Slavo at shtfplan.com.
[00:18:34.336 --> 00:18:37.197]  America's biggest killer is the chart anti-gunners don't want you to see.
[00:18:37.377 --> 00:18:39.998]  Alex covered this briefly in yesterday's article, but I want to make
[00:18:40.618 --> 00:18:46.539]  In addition to this chart, this chart shows the 10 biggest killers in the United States.
[00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:54.021]  And at the top of the chart is tobacco use at 529,000 deaths per annum.
[00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:58.021]  And underneath that is medical errors at 195,000 deaths.
[00:18:58.201 --> 00:18:59.902]  And it goes on down the chart.
[00:19:00.602 --> 00:19:05.323]  And guns or firearm homicides are at the very bottom of the chart.
[00:19:06.423 --> 00:19:06.943]  Underneath,
[00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:11.827]  Falls, unintentional falls, people falling and dying.
[00:19:12.807 --> 00:19:19.389]  Motor vehicle accidents are three times, three hundred percent larger than firearm homicides.
[00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:25.810]  Alcohol abuse is almost ten times higher in terms of deaths than firearm homicides.
[00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.931]  Unintentional injuries also twelve times higher and so on.
[00:19:31.491 --> 00:19:33.132]  And if you look at the firearm homicides,
[00:19:34.272 --> 00:19:38.614]  Most of those are gang-related crimes where gangbangers are shooting up each other.
[00:19:39.294 --> 00:19:43.075]  It's not like they're actually going after just random people on the street.
[00:19:43.095 --> 00:19:43.875]  They're going after each other.
[00:19:44.916 --> 00:19:48.357]  So, that chart, it needs an update.
[00:19:48.397 --> 00:19:50.158]  I've got new information to add to it.
[00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:53.339]  And I'll bring that to you when we return here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:55.419]  This is Mike Adams sitting in for Alex today.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:55.980]  Stay with us.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:56.600]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.557 --> 00:20:04.343]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:20:05.044 --> 00:20:07.807]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:20:08.228 --> 00:20:10.571]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:13.534]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:20:13.955 --> 00:20:16.919]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:20:17.399 --> 00:20:21.965]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:20:22.526 --> 00:20:24.648]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:28.173]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:20:28.734 --> 00:20:32.418]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[00:21:01.963 --> 00:21:05.766]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[00:21:06.827 --> 00:21:08.528]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:21:08.908 --> 00:21:10.189]  Police call it robbery.
[00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:12.150]  We call it avoidable.
[00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:18.255]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[00:21:18.675 --> 00:21:23.579]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[00:21:23.959 --> 00:21:29.963]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[00:21:31.104 --> 00:21:35.889]  At only $34.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans.

[00:22:28.224 --> 00:22:32.607]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:32.807 --> 00:22:38.491]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:42.013]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:42.233 --> 00:22:44.855]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:24:12.676 --> 00:24:16.999]  If you're just joining us, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:17.019 --> 00:24:19.501]  This is Mike Adams sitting in for Alex.
[00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:22.603]  He's on an airplane right this minute headed to New York.
[00:24:22.703 --> 00:24:27.727]  He's going to be on the Piers Morgan Show live tonight at 9 p.m.
[00:24:28.047 --> 00:24:28.468]  Eastern.
[00:24:28.908 --> 00:24:31.350]  And you can do the math on when that is in your local area.
[00:24:32.651 --> 00:24:34.272]  So that might be interesting.
[00:24:34.692 --> 00:24:35.433]  Covering other news,
[00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:43.093]  You know, the Orlando gun show sales, this was in Orlando, clickorlando.com over the weekend.
[00:24:43.594 --> 00:24:48.216]  Orlando gun show sales reached record amidst the gun control debate.
[00:24:48.597 --> 00:24:50.458]  8,000 people attended the first day of the gun show.
[00:24:51.238 --> 00:24:52.779]  Normally they probably get, you know, 2,000 people.
[00:24:52.919 --> 00:25:02.344]  And 8,000 people, they had to turn people away and give them a credit to come back the next day because they couldn't fit all the people in there.
[00:25:03.065 --> 00:25:04.446]  And of course, once they got there,
[00:25:05.734 --> 00:25:11.861]  All the guns were sold out, so it's like a gun show where you can't buy anything because it's all sold out.
[00:25:12.882 --> 00:25:14.885]  Actually, there were still some things for sale there.
[00:25:15.145 --> 00:25:20.451]  But gun dealers all across the country are completely wiped out of their supplies of firearms.
[00:25:20.471 --> 00:25:21.372]  This is continuing.
[00:25:21.432 --> 00:25:23.935]  The wait time is getting worse and worse.
[00:25:24.716 --> 00:25:31.420]  I've been talking to some of the gun distributors and dealers and manufacturers that I know personally, and they're telling me it's still on, man.
[00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:48.932]  It's still, people are buying like mad, and people are lining up, just handing them money, handing them, like, here, $3,000, just take this $3,000, find me a .308 battle rifle, the first chance you get, and you just hold onto my money until that happens.
[00:25:50.353 --> 00:25:51.054]  That's what we're seeing now.
[00:25:51.274 --> 00:25:53.075]  It's like, put your money down now and hope.
[00:25:53.556 --> 00:25:54.096]  Hope and pray.
[00:25:54.116 --> 00:25:57.940]  That should be Obama's new slogan.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.302]  Hope and pray that you can never buy a rifle again.
[00:26:00.482 --> 00:26:08.189]  Because they've talked it up so much now, they've created like a one-year wait period without even having a law for it.
[00:26:08.509 --> 00:26:11.372]  They've wiped out the gun supply nationwide.
[00:26:12.312 --> 00:26:17.197]  And the reason that I'm kind of happy today, you know why I'm happy?
[00:26:20.437 --> 00:26:24.961]  I'm happy, because Feinstein and the Liberals have finally shown their cards.
[00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:30.224]  And I actually welcome Dianne Feinstein to amend her bill.
[00:26:30.585 --> 00:26:34.227]  Let's just make it, put everything in the bill that you really, really want, okay?
[00:26:34.447 --> 00:26:35.628]  Just put everything in there.
[00:26:36.189 --> 00:26:45.856]  Let's ban, not just rifles, not just handguns and shotguns, let's ban forks and spoons and knives, because, you know, you could whack somebody in the temple with a spoon.
[00:26:46.744 --> 00:26:47.285]  I can hurt.
[00:26:47.785 --> 00:26:51.148]  We should just ban spoons and make people eat with sticks like they did in China.
[00:26:51.729 --> 00:26:54.991]  Just have Americans, all Americans, it's time for chopsticks.
[00:26:55.552 --> 00:26:59.916]  And you can't sharpen the chopsticks because those could be weapons of mass destruction.
[00:27:00.296 --> 00:27:01.677]  So everybody eat with chopsticks.
[00:27:02.678 --> 00:27:19.607]  And, while we're at it, Senator Feinstein, why not just add into your bill that anyone who owns a gun can't have a website, can't have a First Amendment right, can't have a Second Amendment right, and that if you say anything against Obama, then let's say you shouldn't even have a Fifth Amendment right.
[00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:25.070]  In fact, all your Bill of Rights completely gone if you speak your mind.
[00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:30.213]  If you don't worship Feinstein and Obama, then you should be denied all of your rights.
[00:27:30.273 --> 00:27:31.534]  Let's just get it all out in there.
[00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:42.626]  And Feinstein's bill, by the way, banned grenade launchers on semi-auto rifles, as if you could just walk down to the gun store and buy a grenade launcher.
[00:27:43.607 --> 00:27:43.927]  Really?
[00:27:44.628 --> 00:27:48.410]  Is she so ignorant that she thinks that you can buy grenade launchers?
[00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:57.137]  In fact, the NRA even pointed out, why not just add to the bill banning particle beam weapons on your rifle?
[00:27:57.337 --> 00:27:58.898]  Yeah, particle beam weapons.
[00:27:59.318 --> 00:28:01.160]  And how about laser blasters?
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:10.825]  And why not handheld rifle-mounted tactical nukes out of Robert Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers?
[00:28:11.286 --> 00:28:23.813]  Let's just ban fully automated robotic body armor suits with self-seeking nuclear weapons and particle beams and laser blasters.
[00:28:28.143 --> 00:28:28.664]  Wonderful!
[00:28:28.884 --> 00:28:29.885]  We get sound effects today.
[00:28:30.406 --> 00:28:37.633]  Thank you, Feinstein, for painting such a wonderfully imaginative view of what America really needs today.
[00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:49.246]  I think we should get Han Solo, we should get the Han Solo character on the show to talk about his laser blasters, and then have Feinstein threaten to ban Han Solo.
[00:28:49.746 --> 00:28:50.526]  That's what we should do.
[00:28:51.307 --> 00:28:58.210]  No more Han Solo, no more laser blasters, and God forbid no lightsabers, because if you had a lightsaber, you could go into a school and just wreak havoc.
[00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.392]  So no more lightsabers, Dianne Feinstein.
[00:29:03.612 --> 00:29:07.194]  That's something we can support, banning lightsabers in the hands of the Jedi.
[00:29:08.533 --> 00:29:12.456]  All right, now getting back to reality here in the short time we have left.
[00:29:12.977 --> 00:29:15.399]  Sorry to get carried away, but it's so insane.
[00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:17.220]  All we can do is laugh at it at this point.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.504]  It's so insane that you don't have a right to self-defense.
[00:29:22.585 --> 00:29:24.066]  You don't have a First Amendment.
[00:29:24.526 --> 00:29:26.648]  You don't even have the right to engage in commerce.
[00:29:26.968 --> 00:29:34.835]  Here's a story of the Bank of America freezing the deposits of a licensed gun manufacturer that was selling parts online.
[00:29:35.555 --> 00:29:39.237]  It's an economic embargo on top of the insanity!
[00:29:39.998 --> 00:29:40.698]  All right, stay with us.
[00:29:40.718 --> 00:29:42.159]  We've got guests and more news coming up.
[00:29:42.199 --> 00:29:44.220]  This is Mike Adams on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.781]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:29:45.801 --> 00:29:46.282]  Stay with us.
[00:29:47.402 --> 00:29:48.283]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.783 --> 00:29:50.384]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:33:19.634 --> 00:33:29.443]  That was Han Solo there.
[00:33:29.463 --> 00:33:32.085]  That little quote you might have heard.
[00:33:32.105 --> 00:33:33.286]  What did he say?
[00:33:33.747 --> 00:33:37.410]  Your ancient arts and hocus pocus is no match for a good blaster or something?
[00:33:39.011 --> 00:33:42.595]  Anyway, that's one of my favorite lines from Star Wars.
[00:33:42.635 --> 00:33:43.195]  There are many.
[00:33:44.561 --> 00:33:48.184]  These are not the droids you're looking for, being another.
[00:33:48.484 --> 00:33:53.348]  Alright, I'm geeking out here on the Alex Jones Show by quoting Star Wars.
[00:33:53.368 --> 00:33:57.852]  If it gets any worse, I'll start quoting Star Trek lines too.
[00:33:58.132 --> 00:33:58.632]  Let's move on.
[00:33:59.473 --> 00:34:03.216]  We've got a guest coming up in just a couple of minutes, Mark Baker from Baker's Green Acres.
[00:34:03.296 --> 00:34:12.142]  He is the small farm owner who has been just endlessly harassed by the state of Michigan and it's DNR, the Department of Natural Resources there.
[00:34:12.783 --> 00:34:13.704]  Gonna go to him in a second.
[00:34:14.745 --> 00:34:15.686]  But first let me cover this.
[00:34:15.766 --> 00:34:22.555]  This has been reported in a website called ironicsurrealism.com.
[00:34:22.775 --> 00:34:24.037]  I'm not familiar with that site.
[00:34:25.553 --> 00:34:35.501]  The Bank of America freezes licensed gun manufacturers' deposits, and this is a company called American Spirit Arms, at americanspiritarms.com.
[00:34:35.941 --> 00:34:48.110]  The owner's name is Joe Sirachman, and he posted on Facebook that the Bank of America seized his deposits, his online retailing deposits,
[00:34:49.611 --> 00:35:01.164]  And that the manager in Bank of America told him that the reason they seized his funds was, quote, we believe you should not be selling guns and parts on the internet.
[00:35:04.025 --> 00:35:04.445]  Wow!
[00:35:05.245 --> 00:35:12.908]  First of all, you can't sell guns on the Internet, just for all the liberals that may be listening and don't know about FFL laws.
[00:35:13.469 --> 00:35:14.849]  You can't sell guns on the Internet.
[00:35:15.089 --> 00:35:19.931]  You can accept a payment for a gun on the Internet, but you can't deliver the gun to the person's house.
[00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:24.953]  You have to deliver it to a local dealer, obviously, where that person undergoes a background check and so on and so forth.
[00:35:25.713 --> 00:35:27.234]  FFL, Federal Firearms License.
[00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:38.290]  But the fact that this Bank of America representative reportedly said you shouldn't be selling gun parts on the internet either, well there you go.
[00:35:38.351 --> 00:35:45.174]  It's all part of the economic embargo against actual Americans, against actual patriots.
[00:35:46.034 --> 00:35:54.178]  And another example of that economic embargo is happening right now against our friend Mark Baker from bakersgreenacres.com.
[00:35:54.898 --> 00:36:00.801]  And Mark joins us by phone to give us the latest breakdown of what's happening to him in Michigan.
[00:36:00.861 --> 00:36:02.402]  Mark, thank you for joining the show.
[00:36:02.942 --> 00:36:03.762]  How are you doing today, man?
[00:36:04.242 --> 00:36:04.723]  Good, Mike.
[00:36:04.743 --> 00:36:05.203]  How are you doing?
[00:36:06.055 --> 00:36:07.997]  Well, I'm flipping out.
[00:36:08.577 --> 00:36:10.839]  I'm just looking at all this news.
[00:36:10.879 --> 00:36:11.620]  It's so insane.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.381]  It's off the charts.
[00:36:14.062 --> 00:36:15.963]  And what you're experiencing is similar to it.
[00:36:16.003 --> 00:36:22.309]  Go ahead and give our audience... Go back to the beginning, but keep it brief in case people aren't familiar with your story.
[00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:25.111]  Take us back to what happened in the beginning and then bring us up to date.
[00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:25.752]  Okay.
[00:36:26.072 --> 00:36:29.635]  One year ago, we were told that the pigs that we raised
[00:36:30.976 --> 00:36:44.106]  are going to be considered illegal in the state of Michigan because they have one of nine characteristics that the Michigan Department of Natural Resources outlined in their declaratory ruling.
[00:36:45.507 --> 00:36:51.892]  The characteristics are as crazy as if a pig has a straight tail, it's illegal.
[00:36:51.912 --> 00:36:54.074]  If a pig has a curly tail, it's illegal.
[00:36:54.354 --> 00:36:56.436]  If a pig has a straight ear, it's illegal.
[00:36:56.776 --> 00:36:57.877]  Floppy ear, illegal.
[00:36:58.562 --> 00:37:01.763]  And then number nine is other characteristics not currently known.
[00:37:02.203 --> 00:37:04.223]  So anything they just want to invent, basically?
[00:37:04.243 --> 00:37:05.444]  Right, anything they want.
[00:37:05.784 --> 00:37:11.365]  And so, we were told that we had to depopulate our animals by April 1st of 2012.
[00:37:11.705 --> 00:37:14.746]  And when you say depopulate, you mean kill them?
[00:37:15.626 --> 00:37:18.047]  Kill them, push them in a hole.
[00:37:18.867 --> 00:37:26.109]  I'm former military, and I know that if I'm given an order that is illegal or unlawful, that it is my duty to
[00:37:27.717 --> 00:37:38.022]  To not carry that order out, so I chose to decline the order, and we leveled two against the state for relief, so we could go on and continue our business.
[00:37:39.383 --> 00:37:51.268]  The pigs that we raised are Mangalitsa and Mangalitsa hybrids, and we used a Russian boar cross, and they have some of the characteristics that the DNR has outlined.
[00:37:51.408 --> 00:37:52.849]  Anyway, we took them to court.
[00:37:54.126 --> 00:37:55.587]  It has dragged on.
[00:37:55.948 --> 00:38:01.211]  We still haven't argued the case in court, and it's on and on and on.
[00:38:02.292 --> 00:38:07.755]  Finally, the last shot across our bow was two weeks ago.
[00:38:08.476 --> 00:38:14.800]  We wanted to have some of our animals butchered through the USDA slaughter plant that we've used for five years.
[00:38:15.781 --> 00:38:22.365]  And the man that owns the plant says he wasn't able to because the USDA showed him pictures
[00:38:23.141 --> 00:38:28.664]  And if our pigs had those characteristics, they couldn't... Wait a minute.
[00:38:28.864 --> 00:38:36.828]  So the order has come down from the USDA to all the pig processing plants, pork processing plants there.
[00:38:37.819 --> 00:38:44.042]  You know, I wanted to get a copy of all that stuff from the guy at the plant, but he's afraid of the USDA because they can shut him down.
[00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:01.442]  I don't have any of that yet.
[00:39:01.562 --> 00:39:04.003]  Our lawyers are procuring that as we speak.
[00:39:04.483 --> 00:39:04.683]  Wow.
[00:39:04.823 --> 00:39:07.505]  So I guess Porky the Pig is the new Al Qaeda.
[00:39:10.626 --> 00:39:17.449]  But this sounds like an economic embargo against you where they, like you said, you had used this plant before.
[00:39:17.489 --> 00:39:20.510]  They had processed some of your pigs before for years.
[00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:22.111]  Yeah, five years we've used them.
[00:39:22.591 --> 00:39:23.392]  And now they say, sorry.
[00:39:25.225 --> 00:39:28.266]  So you couldn't get your pigs processed, which means you couldn't sell them.
[00:39:28.646 --> 00:39:28.866]  Right.
[00:39:29.506 --> 00:39:29.726]  Right.
[00:39:29.926 --> 00:39:34.588]  And if we can't sell the pigs, then we can't afford to feed the ones that are coming up, the younger ones.
[00:39:35.708 --> 00:39:49.392]  And so we were forced to make some decisions, and the decisions that we made was right before Christmas, we would slaughter our mature cows, which are like 400 pound animals.
[00:39:50.493 --> 00:39:51.453]  And so we did that.
[00:39:52.802 --> 00:39:56.185]  The weekend right after Christmas, and then last weekend we finished.
[00:39:56.905 --> 00:39:58.746]  Got them all slaughtered.
[00:39:58.906 --> 00:40:11.475]  So the government has forced you to kill your own animals, which will hurt your future business, and they're denying you a source of revenue because your pigs have a characteristic that they don't like.
[00:40:12.355 --> 00:40:12.796]  That's it.
[00:40:13.196 --> 00:40:13.936]  Like fur color.
[00:40:13.956 --> 00:40:15.157]  It's almost like skin color.
[00:40:15.257 --> 00:40:20.841]  It's like saying... It's almost a kind of animal racism, you could say.
[00:40:21.311 --> 00:40:22.272]  Well, it really is.
[00:40:22.772 --> 00:40:29.979]  They're saying that we have a problem with feral animals, and feralness is a behavior, right?
[00:40:32.742 --> 00:40:46.415]  And now they're saying that if my pigs are black, or they're black and white, or they're black and red, then they are more likely to be feral, so I have to get rid of them.
[00:40:47.828 --> 00:40:58.014]  And the only cut out, the only carve out that they've given is to guys that raise pigs in confinement, and those are usually corporately held.
[00:40:58.334 --> 00:40:59.995]  Yeah, like corporate feedlot operations.
[00:41:00.055 --> 00:41:00.756]  Right, right.
[00:41:00.996 --> 00:41:03.337]  So they're not affected by this at all.
[00:41:04.158 --> 00:41:04.458]  Got it.
[00:41:05.278 --> 00:41:07.080]  It's the family farm that's affected.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:16.085]  And, you know, if you were to call, if your listeners were to call the Michigan DNR right now, they'd probably get a story like, oh, that doesn't apply.
[00:41:17.068 --> 00:41:17.809]  We're good.
[00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:39.674]  It's the floppy ears law.
[00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:45.118]  But look, listeners, check out Mark Baker's website, bakersgreenacres.com.
[00:41:45.258 --> 00:41:48.560]  There are some great videos there that describe all of this in more detail.
[00:41:49.261 --> 00:41:53.664]  And if you're able, you may also wish to offer some small donations of support.
[00:41:53.704 --> 00:42:00.589]  Mark Baker and his attorneys are fighting this, fighting against the highly oppressive Michigan government over this issue.
[00:42:01.289 --> 00:42:04.612]  What's the next step for your lawsuit, Mark?
[00:42:05.333 --> 00:42:12.198]  I know the courts have been denying you an actual trial, but what's the next step?
[00:42:12.218 --> 00:42:14.740]  You mentioned something happening maybe in June of this year.
[00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:15.621]  What's going on?
[00:42:15.641 --> 00:42:29.433]  Right, the last step that we had, I mean that will help put it in perspective, we filed a motion with the court and said that we believe that the declaratory ruling is vague.
[00:42:30.613 --> 00:42:45.140]  And therefore it's unconstitutional if it's vague, because if they're going to charge me with a felony for these pigs that I have, and that is what harboring an invasive species is punishable with, if they're going to charge me with a felony, then it cannot be vague.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:50.482]  It has to be very to the point, very clear, so a person knows that they're breaking the law.
[00:42:51.082 --> 00:42:59.366]  And we felt as though the ninth characteristic, where it says other characteristics not currently known to the DNR, as a
[00:43:00.806 --> 00:43:03.608]  Um, a characteristic that could make me a felon.
[00:43:03.628 --> 00:43:05.349]  We felt that that was vague.
[00:43:06.169 --> 00:43:08.170]  And so we filed a motion with the court.
[00:43:08.851 --> 00:43:10.172]  The judge heard the motion.
[00:43:10.632 --> 00:43:12.853]  The judge said, I'll let you know in 30 days.
[00:43:12.873 --> 00:43:14.514]  35 days come.
[00:43:14.654 --> 00:43:16.415]  And he says, no, I don't think it's vague.
[00:43:16.796 --> 00:43:17.516]  I think it's good.
[00:43:18.216 --> 00:43:20.658]  So now we have to go back to court.
[00:43:21.718 --> 00:43:26.001]  And trying to schedule a court is tough.
[00:43:26.822 --> 00:43:28.863]  And they're telling us we're not going to be able to get in.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.482]  Alright, so he doesn't think that whatever we want to make up, that's not vague, huh?
[00:43:34.502 --> 00:43:35.363]  That's wild.
[00:43:35.443 --> 00:43:49.851]  That's kind of like the United Nations treaty, human rights treaty, that says something like, oh yeah, you have all your rights, unless it opposes whatever we want the UN to do.
[00:43:49.871 --> 00:43:56.194]  It's just a very general, vague statement that is kind of a blanket statement that nullifies everything else they just said.
[00:43:57.395 --> 00:44:00.558]  Well, let me ask you a bigger question here, Mark.
[00:44:00.598 --> 00:44:04.262]  Let's take your situation and expand it to the nation.
[00:44:04.682 --> 00:44:12.089]  So just as you have been denied your right to engage in farming, and your food freedoms have been taken away, and you're...
[00:44:13.427 --> 00:44:14.508]  You used to be in the military.
[00:44:14.528 --> 00:44:15.709]  You served this country.
[00:44:15.729 --> 00:44:16.249]  Right.
[00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:29.060]  Now, all Americans are being threatened with having their rights taken away by Dianne Feinstein, Obama, Biden, all the other gun grabbers who are suddenly saying, well, the Second Amendment doesn't apply.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.002]  The Bill of Rights doesn't apply.
[00:44:31.022 --> 00:44:34.345]  We can just take these away from you because we want to.
[00:44:34.365 --> 00:44:34.445]  Yeah.
[00:44:35.686 --> 00:44:39.830]  What are your thoughts on what's happening in America as a whole today?
[00:44:41.351 --> 00:44:44.112]  Well, did you ever see the movie Ants?
[00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:46.452]  Oh yeah, yeah, I saw that.
[00:44:47.012 --> 00:44:48.292]  I think that's my feeling.
[00:44:49.373 --> 00:44:59.515]  I was at an event yesterday and I looked out over the crowd and I saw probably 300 men, you know, from ages, say, 20 to 60.
[00:45:00.335 --> 00:45:07.957]  And the nature of that event, I felt as though most of those men feel the same way that I do about our country and our freedoms.
[00:45:09.057 --> 00:45:09.797]  And we have a few
[00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:18.126]  People like Dianne Feinstein that are going to level some new law, you know, because there's been some tragedies in the country.
[00:45:18.246 --> 00:45:30.892]  I think, uh, I think it's about time the men get together and start saying, um, we're going to come to the table and offer you our suggestion of what things, of the way things ought to go.
[00:45:31.252 --> 00:45:33.353]  And that wouldn't be the first time that's been done in this country.
[00:45:34.087 --> 00:45:42.438]  Well, and when you say come to the table and offer you our suggestion, I mean, wouldn't that suggestion be to basically have all of you gun grabbers arrested as traitors?
[00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.721]  I mean, isn't that what the Constitution really says?
[00:45:45.262 --> 00:45:49.288]  Yeah, if I was one of those gun grabbers, I think that I'd be barring the door.
[00:45:51.633 --> 00:45:52.294]  Good point.
[00:45:52.914 --> 00:45:55.076]  Hey, in fact, I've got an article that I'm going to read here.
[00:45:55.296 --> 00:45:58.720]  Not the whole thing, but I'm going to read this in the next segment.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.844]  This is by Paul Howe from CombatShootingandTactics.com.
[00:46:02.924 --> 00:46:03.784]  Paul Howe.
[00:46:04.365 --> 00:46:06.487]  He is an outstanding firearms instructor.
[00:46:06.507 --> 00:46:07.648]  You may know who he is, Mark.
[00:46:07.668 --> 00:46:08.269]  I don't.
[00:46:08.709 --> 00:46:11.251]  Well, he's an incredible tactical instructor.
[00:46:11.692 --> 00:46:15.936]  His article's entitled, Second Amendment and the Kool-Aid Drinkers, and I'm going to go through some of the highlights of that.
[00:46:16.216 --> 00:46:33.511]  It's very powerful, because he talks about, and he's not a radical guy or anything, he's a constitutional patriot, you know, very upstanding citizen, and he talks about, like this, after the first few raids, he's talking about if gun confiscation is kicked off,
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.981]  The word would get out and Americans would start to fight back.
[00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:44.323]  It would only take one good ambush from a house or along a travel route to decimate a tactical force or make it combat ineffective.
[00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:49.024]  That seems to be what I'm hearing from more and more people, in fact.
[00:46:50.684 --> 00:46:57.466]  Well, they have to get young men to perform these gun confiscations.
[00:46:58.706 --> 00:47:00.467]  And those men have lives.
[00:47:00.607 --> 00:47:01.427]  They only have one.
[00:47:02.048 --> 00:47:02.949]  They have families.
[00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:05.851]  They have, you know, things that they like to do on weekends.
[00:47:06.011 --> 00:47:10.814]  And, you know, they would be going into a very precarious situation.
[00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:13.736]  These are American citizens we're talking about here.
[00:47:13.756 --> 00:47:16.098]  These are not Canadians, you know.
[00:47:16.438 --> 00:47:17.579]  This isn't Australia.
[00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:19.260]  This is the United States of America.
[00:47:20.441 --> 00:47:22.983]  I think they better rethink what they're talking about.
[00:47:23.823 --> 00:47:27.624]  Well, you know, I think we need more Americans to stand up like you have done.
[00:47:28.164 --> 00:47:31.925]  You refuse to lay down to the Michigan DNR, and you're fighting it.
[00:47:32.145 --> 00:47:34.466]  And that is the path to victory.
[00:47:34.486 --> 00:47:37.527]  The victory is within our reach.
[00:47:37.667 --> 00:47:40.228]  All we have to do is call their bluff and stand up to them.
[00:47:40.768 --> 00:47:43.549]  All these people that are calling for gun grabbing, they don't...
[00:47:44.369 --> 00:47:49.051]  They don't have experience in the field with firearms.
[00:47:49.612 --> 00:47:51.613]  They're hoping someone else will do it for them.
[00:47:51.933 --> 00:47:52.333]  Oh, right.
[00:47:52.413 --> 00:47:59.377]  You know, Senator Feinstein, she's not going to grab a gun and kick in your front door and throw a flashbang in there and say, I'm Feinstein, here to get your guns!
[00:47:59.817 --> 00:48:02.558]  No, she's going to try to recruit somebody else to do that.
[00:48:02.678 --> 00:48:06.900]  Although, it would be an interesting video if she actually tried to do that, but she's probably not.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:07.981]  No, no.
[00:48:08.081 --> 00:48:12.163]  She'll get some other American to do it, some 23-year-old kid that wants to be
[00:48:13.126 --> 00:48:16.329]  Well, where do you think this is all going?
[00:48:34.658 --> 00:48:36.499]  Not just in Michigan, but where do you think it's all headed?
[00:48:36.519 --> 00:48:43.663]  Because look, I think your issue that you're facing there, Mark, is just a symptom of America, the erosion of freedoms and liberties.
[00:48:43.703 --> 00:48:44.824]  It's all the same issue.
[00:48:45.584 --> 00:48:46.205]  I agree, Mike.
[00:48:47.866 --> 00:48:53.429]  Like with the gun issue, they want to take everybody's gun because one nut did something crazy, right?
[00:48:53.509 --> 00:48:54.589]  It's the same thing with the pigs.
[00:48:54.609 --> 00:49:01.273]  They want to take the farmers' pigs because there are supposedly some feral pigs that are doing damage to golf courses.
[00:49:01.893 --> 00:49:03.034]  It's kind of the same thing.
[00:49:03.424 --> 00:49:17.914]  Well, that's like saying that if somebody's bull gets loose and their bull runs around the golf course tearing up the golf course, which I'm sure a bull would have a wonderful time doing that, to say, well, now all bulls are going to be illegal or cows are going to be banned in Michigan.
[00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:18.354]  It's the same thing.
[00:49:18.374 --> 00:49:19.175]  Sure, it's the same thing.
[00:49:19.195 --> 00:49:23.257]  Or if a dog bit somebody, let's do away with all dogs.
[00:49:23.478 --> 00:49:24.098]  Right, right.
[00:49:24.238 --> 00:49:25.679]  Yeah, it's a felony to have a dog.
[00:49:26.019 --> 00:49:26.339]  Yeah.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.002]  So, this thing with Americans,
[00:49:30.495 --> 00:49:45.359]  Picking up guns, that's a really hot topic, and I know, I come in contact with a lot of people that talk about this, and I don't think, I think that is the one issue that is really going to kick the can over.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:51.281]  And we're coming to a showdown, there's no doubt about it, and it's going to go one way or the other.
[00:49:52.742 --> 00:49:57.003]  Same thing with the pigs, we're coming to a showdown, either we have the right to farm
[00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:58.784]  Or we don't.
[00:49:59.145 --> 00:50:02.876]  But if they want to take that right away from us, somebody's got to come take it.
[00:50:03.629 --> 00:50:05.570]  Well, Mark, I am confident.
[00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:06.591]  I'm absolutely confident.
[00:50:06.611 --> 00:50:11.495]  In fact, I have a great sense of optimism about all this over the last few days after really digging into this.
[00:50:12.035 --> 00:50:14.077]  The gun owners are going to win big time.
[00:50:14.297 --> 00:50:14.817]  Big time!
[00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:19.341]  Because the insanity has gotten so bad that it can't continue.
[00:50:19.581 --> 00:50:29.108]  Did you, I don't know if you heard the first part of the show, but did you hear the story out of the New York Post that welfare recipients now are using their EBT cards, that's their government handout cards,
[00:50:29.628 --> 00:50:32.429]  At strip clubs, liquor stores, and X-rated shops.
[00:50:32.869 --> 00:50:34.710]  That's where they're using your tax money, Mark.
[00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:38.491]  Well, yeah.
[00:50:38.971 --> 00:50:39.951]  I don't like that too good.
[00:50:42.712 --> 00:50:44.633]  Yeah, that's how insane it has become.
[00:50:44.953 --> 00:50:46.013]  But anyway, stay with us, Mark.
[00:50:46.033 --> 00:50:48.074]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:50:48.174 --> 00:50:51.235]  More from Mark Baker here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:51.255 --> 00:50:52.795]  This is Mike Adams sitting in.
[00:50:52.815 --> 00:50:53.396]  Stay with us.
[00:50:53.416 --> 00:50:54.196]  A lot straight ahead.
[00:50:58.137 --> 00:51:01.999]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[00:51:02.139 --> 00:51:09.342]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[00:51:09.642 --> 00:51:12.043]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[00:51:12.343 --> 00:51:18.686]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[00:51:18.946 --> 00:51:20.067]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[00:51:20.347 --> 00:51:28.977]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[00:51:29.378 --> 00:51:33.142]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[00:51:33.363 --> 00:51:35.225]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:51:35.405 --> 00:51:37.585]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:01.990]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:52:02.671 --> 00:52:04.771]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:52:05.701 --> 00:52:14.025]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[00:52:14.665 --> 00:52:19.567]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:55.410]  Protect your immune system.
[00:52:55.691 --> 00:52:56.711]  It's the only one you've got.
[00:52:58.578 --> 00:53:00.039]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[00:53:00.819 --> 00:53:05.422]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[00:53:05.882 --> 00:53:07.283]  This is really scary stuff.
[00:53:07.703 --> 00:53:12.406]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[00:53:12.966 --> 00:53:20.151]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[00:53:20.993 --> 00:53:23.215]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[00:53:23.775 --> 00:53:26.958]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[00:53:27.578 --> 00:53:35.685]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[00:53:36.125 --> 00:53:46.274]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[00:53:47.014 --> 00:53:51.837]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[00:53:52.337 --> 00:53:54.018]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[00:54:16.832 --> 00:54:17.272]  All right.
[00:54:18.433 --> 00:54:19.874]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:19.894 --> 00:54:22.836]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex.
[00:54:22.876 --> 00:54:28.319]  I'm the editor of NaturalNews.com and a frequent contributor to InfoWars.com.
[00:54:28.359 --> 00:54:30.280]  Go to InfoWars.com right now, by the way.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.041]  A lot of news stories being posted there.
[00:54:32.781 --> 00:54:43.808]  Every morning, excuse me, every morning Kurt Nimmo and Adan are cranking away and Paul Joseph Watson, of course, also working at the early hours of our morning in the U.S.
[00:54:43.828 --> 00:54:45.369]  He's based, obviously, in the U.K.
[00:54:46.409 --> 00:54:48.251]  A lot of great information there.
[00:54:48.271 --> 00:54:59.183]  I was just thinking, we need a new B-movie called Invasion of the Zombie Redcoats.
[00:54:59.984 --> 00:55:02.927]  You know how they have all that zombie ammo out there now?
[00:55:03.708 --> 00:55:06.651]  Hornady and all these companies have zombie ammo, ZombieMax.
[00:55:07.712 --> 00:55:14.434]  And there's even a company that has a varmint round called, like, Zombageddon or something.
[00:55:14.494 --> 00:55:14.995]  It's really great.
[00:55:15.595 --> 00:55:17.215]  We should have a new B-movie.
[00:55:17.235 --> 00:55:20.997]  The Zombie Redcoats try to take over Washington.
[00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:25.331]  And I'm not going to go into that too much more.
[00:55:26.011 --> 00:55:27.031]  Sorry, I get carried away.
[00:55:27.212 --> 00:55:34.014]  But let's go into this article and ask for Mark Baker's feedback on it again.
[00:55:34.474 --> 00:55:46.277]  Mark Baker joins us with bakersgreenacres.com and he, of course, has been threatened with felony crimes by the state of Michigan for raising pigs that he's been raising for many, many years.
[00:55:46.317 --> 00:55:50.719]  In fact, his family has been in the farming business for, I think, generations.
[00:55:52.559 --> 00:56:15.767]  Mark, we talked about what the reaction might be from Americans if there were a gun confiscation order, but I think people don't realize that if they turn in their guns, then they're going to lose all their other freedoms, such as farming freedom, as you're also experiencing now, but food freedom, medical freedom, freedom to say no to vaccines, all these other issues that people want to have a choice on.
[00:56:16.927 --> 00:56:17.887]  What are your thoughts on that, Mark?
[00:56:18.387 --> 00:56:19.788]  Oh, that's the easy one for me.
[00:56:19.948 --> 00:56:27.449]  I just, I'm a student of history and I know that gun registration is always followed by gun confiscation.
[00:56:28.389 --> 00:56:34.951]  And when the people don't have guns, the people who do have guns can tell them to do whatever they want.
[00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:42.252]  So, if your guns are being confiscated from you,
[00:56:43.228 --> 00:56:46.611]  You might as well get ready to get herded onto cattle cars next.
[00:56:47.692 --> 00:56:49.213]  Because they'll be able to do it to you.
[00:56:50.033 --> 00:56:50.274]  Sure.
[00:56:50.354 --> 00:56:51.575]  And you won't have any choice.
[00:56:53.336 --> 00:57:00.722]  You know, everybody knows that the right to own and bear arms is not about hunting or keeping the Indians out of the camp.
[00:57:01.002 --> 00:57:03.084]  It's really about the balance of powers.
[00:57:03.124 --> 00:57:07.608]  We're supposed to have federal troops, state troops, and then citizen militia.
[00:57:07.788 --> 00:57:09.149]  That's how it's supposed to be set up.
[00:57:09.869 --> 00:57:11.751]  So that the citizens can come to the table
[00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:14.177]  Well, that's what's fascinating.
[00:57:14.217 --> 00:57:22.567]  You see, the gun-grabbing liberals, and I don't want to always use the term liberal in a negative connotation, but in this context it is, in the sense that
[00:57:32.518 --> 00:57:33.579]  They're so naive.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.001]  Apparently they've never studied history.
[00:57:36.601 --> 00:57:42.165]  They don't know that they, too, will be rounded up eventually or oppressed eventually.
[00:57:42.565 --> 00:57:49.150]  You see, they want to have the federal government take away the guns, but then they don't think about, well, what about the next election?
[00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:51.411]  What if there's another tyrant that gets the White House?
[00:57:52.546 --> 00:57:58.913]  Even a Republican tyrant, let's say, who's worse than Obama, worse than Clinton, worse than Bush, or whatever.
[00:57:59.834 --> 00:58:06.581]  And that person uses the power that Obama took from the people to then commit genocide.
[00:58:06.741 --> 00:58:08.283]  See, the liberals don't think ahead.
[00:58:08.303 --> 00:58:09.003]  I don't know.
[00:58:09.083 --> 00:58:09.644]  I don't get it.
[00:58:09.664 --> 00:58:11.686]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:58:11.946 --> 00:58:15.190]  It's kind of short-sightedness, but that's typical of what they do.
[00:58:15.697 --> 00:58:16.237]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:16.277 --> 00:58:19.658]  Well, I guess foresight requires intelligence, and that's just asking too much.
[00:58:19.678 --> 00:58:21.618]  But Mark Baker, thank you for joining us today.
[00:58:21.638 --> 00:58:22.779]  It's been a pleasure having you on.
[00:58:23.059 --> 00:58:23.939]  Thanks for having me on, Mike.
[00:58:24.459 --> 00:58:24.759]  Thank you.
[00:58:24.799 --> 00:58:26.740]  And go to bakersgreenacres.com.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:35.642]  Learn more about the fight that Mark Baker is having with the state of Michigan and their attempts to oppress farm freedom and food freedom right under our noses.
[00:58:35.702 --> 00:58:36.382]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:36.402 --> 00:58:44.604]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:53.214]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:58:53.454 --> 00:58:55.656]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:58:55.876 --> 00:59:04.803]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:04.983 --> 00:59:08.165]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:59:08.425 --> 00:59:09.846]  There's no priming required.
[00:59:10.107 --> 00:59:10.927]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:59:12.368 --> 00:59:14.870]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:17.271]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:59:17.472 --> 00:59:18.772]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:59:18.893 --> 00:59:21.754]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:59:22.055 --> 00:59:25.237]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:59:25.437 --> 00:59:29.420]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:32.181]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:59:32.321 --> 00:59:33.622]  It's what my family uses.
[00:59:33.883 --> 00:59:37.105]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:59:37.205 --> 00:59:41.808]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:59:42.108 --> 00:59:42.709]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:42.729 --> 00:59:44.091]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:02.677 --> 01:00:06.860]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:07.501 --> 01:00:08.321]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.102 --> 01:00:09.982]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.643 --> 01:00:14.265]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.826 --> 01:00:18.869]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.297 --> 01:00:24.179]  Welcome to the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:24.239 --> 01:00:36.186]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in for Alex today, who is on an airplane to New York right now to appear on CNN later tonight, talking with Piers Morgan.
[01:00:36.986 --> 01:00:45.911]  And so I'm filling in for Alex today and having a good time doing it too because you can't help but make comedy about all the insanity that's going on out there.
[01:00:45.931 --> 01:00:49.133]  It's so insane that you gotta laugh at it.
[01:00:49.773 --> 01:00:52.435]  But we also have some solutions that we're talking about today.
[01:00:52.455 --> 01:00:54.016]  I've got a good solution in fact coming up here.
[01:00:54.336 --> 01:00:57.858]  But first let me give you a preview of what's happening this hour.
[01:00:57.998 --> 01:01:02.281]  At the bottom of this hour we're going to be joined by John Rappaport from nomorefakenews.com.
[01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:13.990]  To discuss psychiatric drugs and how the government's surveillance of your prescription drugs could be turned against you to deny you your constitutional rights.
[01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:20.655]  I also hope to take some calls when John is on the air with us, so I'll announce the phone number in the next segment.
[01:01:20.695 --> 01:01:22.837]  We'll get some calls queued up for John.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:35.349]  And then in the third hour, Aaron Dykes is going to be taking command of the chair here and possibly reading from a Paul Revere book, I heard.
[01:01:35.369 --> 01:01:42.055]  I don't know if that's true or if that was just some banter around the office here, but maybe something to do with Paul Revere.
[01:01:42.075 --> 01:01:42.695]  We'll find out.
[01:01:43.456 --> 01:01:44.937]  And I'll let you know as soon as I know.
[01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:49.201]  Now in the meantime, I've got a solution for all the gun grabbers.
[01:01:49.442 --> 01:01:53.686]  This is the perfect solution for liberals.
[01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:57.809]  You can opt out of the Bill of Rights.
[01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:00.972]  If you hate the Second Amendment, give it up!
[01:02:01.793 --> 01:02:04.774]  If you hate the Bill of Rights, give it up!
[01:02:05.194 --> 01:02:07.015]  All you have to do, folks, here's all you have to do.
[01:02:07.535 --> 01:02:09.636]  Take your passport down to the U.S.
[01:02:09.696 --> 01:02:10.697]  Passport Office.
[01:02:11.677 --> 01:02:13.418]  Denounce your citizenship.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.601]  Book a flight to a nation called North Korea.
[01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:24.302]  Once there, they will give you a new passport, and you can enjoy Utopia!
[01:02:24.982 --> 01:02:27.322]  Under the new regime of freedom!
[01:02:27.342 --> 01:02:31.183]  Of, uh... What's the guy's name there?
[01:02:31.423 --> 01:02:34.684]  Not Kim Jong-il, it's Kim... Kim Jong-un!
[01:02:35.144 --> 01:02:35.544]  Yes!
[01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:38.624]  Because every generation, they change one syllable.
[01:02:39.244 --> 01:02:41.505]  Next time, it's gonna be Kim Jong-uh!
[01:02:42.608 --> 01:02:43.969]  But all the liberals could go there.
[01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:46.510]  And there you have no Second Amendment.
[01:02:46.591 --> 01:02:50.133]  Therefore, therefore, everything must be A-OK.
[01:02:50.653 --> 01:02:57.978]  Never mind the barbed wire facing inward at the border checkpoints to prevent North Koreans from escaping their own country.
[01:02:58.218 --> 01:02:58.878]  Never mind that.
[01:02:59.299 --> 01:03:03.761]  Never mind the fact that the guards face inward with their assault rifles.
[01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:08.705]  Oh yes, they have guns in North Korea, but only in the hands of the government guards.
[01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.326]  But I think the liberals would love that.
[01:03:11.806 --> 01:03:14.127]  So you see, the Bill of Rights is optional.
[01:03:14.867 --> 01:03:17.749]  You can simply give it up for yourself.
[01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:19.990]  But you can't take it from me.
[01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:21.170]  You got that?
[01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:22.751]  You can't take it from me.
[01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:35.036]  And you can't take it from the other patriots and the other veterans and the other lawful and legal gun owners and the other peace officers who are actually trying to restore peace and liberty and freedom in this country.
[01:03:35.716 --> 01:03:36.897]  You can't take it from us.
[01:03:36.937 --> 01:03:38.558]  You can only denounce your own.
[01:03:39.747 --> 01:03:48.852]  In fact, we should just have a website for liberals called, you know, Opt Out of the Bill of Rights.
[01:03:50.853 --> 01:03:53.354]  Put the leaders of that movement up there.
[01:03:53.394 --> 01:03:54.955]  Put Michael Moore up there.
[01:03:54.975 --> 01:03:56.096]  Put Feinstein up there.
[01:03:56.876 --> 01:03:59.458]  The leaders of the Opt Out of the Bill of Rights effort.
[01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:03.440]  That would be very popular in certain circles in Hollywood, I imagine.
[01:04:05.154 --> 01:04:20.703]  Now, there's another thing that we have to remember here, that this very idea, that because one person in Sandy Hook committed a terrible crime of violence, that everybody else in the country is supposed to give up all their rights?
[01:04:21.283 --> 01:04:22.264]  Wait a minute, wait a minute!
[01:04:22.764 --> 01:04:26.186]  One citizen does something bad, every citizen gets punished for it?
[01:04:26.766 --> 01:04:34.431]  Well, by the same logic, if one government bureaucrat ever abuses the freedom of an American citizen, and oh my gosh, they never do that,
[01:04:35.256 --> 01:04:36.557]  Then we should ban all government.
[01:04:37.117 --> 01:04:38.338]  We should eliminate all government.
[01:04:38.378 --> 01:04:42.562]  I mean, using their logic, one person does something wrong, ban everybody.
[01:04:43.402 --> 01:04:47.185]  We should say one government official does something wrong, defund the entire government.
[01:04:47.665 --> 01:04:48.546]  That's their logic.
[01:04:49.487 --> 01:04:55.832]  But of course, they want it selectively applied, not rationally applied across the board.
[01:04:56.132 --> 01:04:56.752]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.772 --> 01:04:57.213]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.115 --> 01:05:00.857]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:05:01.137 --> 01:05:05.960]  The prognosis for the entire planetary system runs from bad to worse.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:13.304]  The globalist model is to shut down cities and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:05:13.444 --> 01:05:18.871]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:05:19.071 --> 01:05:22.815]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:05:23.096 --> 01:05:27.641]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:05:27.842 --> 01:05:33.048]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:05:33.288 --> 01:05:36.371]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:05:36.531 --> 01:05:38.773]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:05:39.034 --> 01:05:43.618]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:05:43.798 --> 01:05:46.241]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.

[01:05:53.868 --> 01:05:54.928]  We're getting prepared.
[01:05:55.128 --> 01:05:55.568]  Are you?
[01:05:55.809 --> 01:05:57.609]  InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:05:58.369 --> 01:06:01.870]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:07.952]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:11.593]  When you're sleeping, who's watching out for intruders and spooks?

[01:07:27.338 --> 01:07:33.522]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:07:34.242 --> 01:07:44.670]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:08:18.404 --> 01:08:18.744]  January 7, 2013.
[01:08:20.245 --> 01:08:24.609]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[01:08:24.889 --> 01:08:26.370]  Some pretty energetic music.
[01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:27.010]  Thanks, guys.
[01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:28.672]  I always appreciate the extra boost.
[01:08:29.412 --> 01:08:30.433]  Not that we need it around here.
[01:08:30.593 --> 01:08:32.534]  Powered by freedom and superfoods.
[01:08:32.834 --> 01:08:33.895]  That's our slogan.
[01:08:34.315 --> 01:08:35.095]  That's our motto.
[01:08:35.716 --> 01:08:55.048]  And speaking of freedom, we've got joining us today the, I guess, the Executive Director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, ISRA, is just going to be joining us for about five minutes or so to give us an update on this sneak attack that happened last night in Illinois, in Springfield.
[01:08:56.028 --> 01:09:02.490]  To try to destroy the Second Amendment rights of all citizens of the state of Illinois.
[01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:10.553]  So, Mr. Pearson, Richard Pearson is his name, and guys, if you'll bring up the website, I'll mention the URL during the interview.
[01:09:11.293 --> 01:09:14.315]  Mr. Pearson, thank you for joining us today on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:14.595 --> 01:09:15.555]  Hey, I'm glad to be here.
[01:09:16.115 --> 01:09:17.756]  Well, thank you, sir, appreciate your time.
[01:09:18.136 --> 01:09:22.778]  Give us an update, a breakdown, what happened yesterday in the state Congress there.
[01:09:24.332 --> 01:09:40.202]  Well, what happened was, we had been working all weekend, you know, with phone calls, and I got lots of complaints, and the phone lines were jammed up, melded down, plugged up, and they decided to withdraw all the bills yesterday at 4 o'clock.
[01:09:40.963 --> 01:09:43.184]  So they were trying to sneak it through on a Sunday?
[01:09:43.844 --> 01:09:44.085]  Right.
[01:09:44.325 --> 01:09:50.969]  But on Sunday we were there, and they decided to hoist the white flag, at least temporarily.
[01:09:51.348 --> 01:09:58.132]  So if this bill had passed, tell us exactly what it would have done in terms of criminalizing firearms in the state.
[01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:05.396]  Well, you wouldn't have been able to own any semi-automatic anything, including 22 rifles with magazines.
[01:10:05.676 --> 01:10:06.137]  Wow!
[01:10:08.058 --> 01:10:14.201]  Do these people not realize how many farmers and ranchers are in Illinois and they need these as tools of the farm?
[01:10:14.561 --> 01:10:15.122]  They don't care.
[01:10:16.235 --> 01:10:18.756]  They don't like anybody that owns guns.
[01:10:18.796 --> 01:10:21.158]  They don't like you because you like guns.
[01:10:21.198 --> 01:10:22.539]  They don't like me because I like guns.
[01:10:23.979 --> 01:10:32.304]  So, surely they must realize that Chicago is already the murder capital of the world, even though it's a quote, gun-free zone.
[01:10:32.724 --> 01:10:36.586]  Well, that's right, but it's because of those guns that it's the murder capital of the world.
[01:10:36.927 --> 01:10:42.730]  Although the second largest city, which is not a gun-free zone, had no murders last year.
[01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:44.511]  And which city would that be?
[01:10:47.205 --> 01:10:55.868]  And so, I don't know how they reconcile this, but they can do it in their own mind because they have magnificent mental power.
[01:10:56.368 --> 01:11:01.489]  How angry are the legal firearms owners in the state of Illinois right now?
[01:11:01.509 --> 01:11:03.050]  Because I'm sure you've heard from a lot of them.
[01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:04.590]  What's the word on the street there?
[01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:05.611]  They are angry.
[01:11:07.991 --> 01:11:14.493]  But that doesn't mean they... This is piloted by the City of Chicago and Rahm Emanuel, and so they're going to bring this back again.
[01:11:14.553 --> 01:11:16.434]  It doesn't matter to them how angry they are.
[01:11:17.533 --> 01:11:21.315]  But so we'll see this again and we will resist with every effort.
[01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:31.923]  But, sir, do they think that they can just make a law on a piece of paper and that nothing's going to happen in response?
[01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:38.507]  Do they think that all the people of the state of Illinois are just going to turn in their guns and become slaves to ROM?
[01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:41.309]  Do they really believe that's going to happen?
[01:11:41.549 --> 01:11:50.014]  Well, I actually think that they do actually believe that's going to happen, but I think the last few days have shown that that might be outside of what's going to happen.
[01:11:52.921 --> 01:11:54.462]  Yeah.
[01:11:54.542 --> 01:11:57.685]  What is your website, Mr. Pearson, so that people can visit?
[01:11:57.705 --> 01:12:00.747]  It is www.isra.org.
[01:12:01.307 --> 01:12:02.849]  Isra.org.
[01:12:02.889 --> 01:12:04.710]  Okay, and I see you have an urgent alert posted there.
[01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:05.491]  That's from yesterday.
[01:12:05.511 --> 01:12:05.571]  Yes.
[01:12:08.093 --> 01:12:12.256]  Are you getting a lot of additional press right now across the country or across the state?
[01:12:12.336 --> 01:12:13.997]  What's happening with the media angle on this?
[01:12:14.738 --> 01:12:18.481]  We are getting lots of interviews, lots of phone calls, lots of emails.
[01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:20.802]  We have people joining.
[01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.644]  We have members from Texas, by the way.
[01:12:23.611 --> 01:12:27.413]  And so we appreciate everyone going to the website and joining.
[01:12:28.494 --> 01:12:29.614]  And we thank you for that.
[01:12:30.895 --> 01:12:31.255]  Excellent.
[01:12:31.415 --> 01:12:31.695]  All right.
[01:12:31.735 --> 01:12:34.176]  Well, I appreciate the update, Richard.
[01:12:34.457 --> 01:12:37.138]  Thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:12:37.538 --> 01:12:42.701]  And keep up the fight, because we, the gun owners of America, will win this.
[01:12:42.741 --> 01:12:44.021]  We just have to continue the fight.
[01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:44.422]  That's all.
[01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:45.862]  We do.
[01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:47.263]  And we have to stick together, too.
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:48.101]  Absolutely.
[01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:55.130]  Well, good job defeating that bill and keep up the effort to fight for liberty and freedom in America.
[01:12:55.451 --> 01:12:55.771]  I will.
[01:12:56.011 --> 01:12:57.533]  Thank you and thank everyone out there.
[01:12:57.754 --> 01:12:58.074]  All right.
[01:12:58.194 --> 01:12:58.515]  Thank you.
[01:12:58.575 --> 01:12:59.095]  Take care then.
[01:12:59.536 --> 01:12:59.856]  All right.
[01:12:59.897 --> 01:13:03.401]  That was Richard Pearson from the Illinois State Rifle Association.
[01:13:04.342 --> 01:13:07.867]  And I'm sure similar events are happening elsewhere across the country.
[01:13:07.907 --> 01:13:20.503]  There are probably various nefarious plans by the state representatives of certain cities, let's say, to try to take away the Second Amendment rights of lawful and legal gun owners, which, by the way, include many
[01:13:21.624 --> 01:13:27.910]  Peace officers, many returning veterans, many active-duty military and active-duty cops as well.
[01:13:28.591 --> 01:13:31.634]  And, you know, I did a story the other day, too, about airline pilots.
[01:13:31.934 --> 01:13:40.242]  You know, most people who fly airplanes don't realize that about 17% of the time you're flying in a plane with an armed pilot.
[01:13:42.069 --> 01:13:42.850]  And that's a good thing.
[01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:48.192]  It's a good thing because we don't want pilots to be overpowered by terrorists, right?
[01:13:48.913 --> 01:13:50.653]  Or hijackers or anything else.
[01:13:50.713 --> 01:13:54.195]  So we arm the pilots and they carry concealed weapons in the flight deck.
[01:13:55.335 --> 01:13:56.296]  And they're prepared to use them.
[01:13:56.916 --> 01:14:00.318]  And I tell you what, the pilots that I know, one pilot in particular,
[01:14:02.246 --> 01:14:09.155]  He's a very good shot with a Colt 1911 and .45 caliber.
[01:14:11.037 --> 01:14:15.203]  He'll put two right in the forehead of any terrorist that tries to break into the flight deck.
[01:14:15.383 --> 01:14:16.264]  No questions asked.
[01:14:16.905 --> 01:14:17.926]  So, there you go.
[01:14:19.244 --> 01:14:19.624]  Pilots.
[01:14:20.065 --> 01:14:20.245]  Yep.
[01:14:20.545 --> 01:14:20.986]  Good guys.
[01:14:21.526 --> 01:14:21.946]  And gals.
[01:14:21.986 --> 01:14:22.467]  A few gals.
[01:14:22.607 --> 01:14:23.548]  But mostly good guys.
[01:14:23.988 --> 01:14:25.690]  Alright, let's go on to this story here.
[01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:27.431]  Second Amendment and the Kool-Aid drinkers.
[01:14:27.471 --> 01:14:28.753]  This was posted by Paul Howe.
[01:14:28.813 --> 01:14:29.733]  I mentioned it earlier.
[01:14:29.753 --> 01:14:33.217]  This is ahead of us being joined by John Rappaport at the bottom of this hour.
[01:14:33.257 --> 01:14:34.458]  This is a very important story.
[01:14:35.783 --> 01:14:37.984]  This is the most important story of the day in my opinion.
[01:14:38.804 --> 01:14:43.626]  Paul Howe is the creator of CombatShootingAndTactics.com.
[01:14:44.286 --> 01:14:45.847]  CombatShootingAndTactics.com.
[01:14:46.527 --> 01:14:49.468]  Paul Howe is a very intelligent firearms instructor.
[01:14:50.268 --> 01:14:54.690]  I've learned a tremendous amount of information from his videos.
[01:14:55.530 --> 01:15:01.476]  I've seen so many millions of Americans purchasing firearms but not necessarily getting good training on how to use them.
[01:15:13.787 --> 01:15:16.309]  And MakeReady.tv is a great place.
[01:15:16.329 --> 01:15:18.971]  You can get online training, tons of videos.
[01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:19.931]  I use it.
[01:15:20.812 --> 01:15:23.133]  It is top-notch, top-quality production.
[01:15:23.173 --> 01:15:25.295]  Panteo Productions is the company.
[01:15:25.575 --> 01:15:27.136]  And no, they didn't pay me to say that.
[01:15:27.696 --> 01:15:29.157]  I'm just a customer and a patriot.
[01:15:29.257 --> 01:15:30.798]  So go to MakeReady.tv.
[01:15:30.838 --> 01:15:32.239]  You can see Paul Howe in action.
[01:15:32.619 --> 01:15:34.261]  Now getting to his article, though.
[01:15:34.721 --> 01:15:35.421]  This is brilliant.
[01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:37.323]  Second Amendment and the Kool-Aid Drinkers.
[01:15:38.123 --> 01:15:43.710]  Paul Howe discusses what would actually happen if gun confiscation were attempted in the United States.
[01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:47.134]  He asks the question, who's coming to get them?
[01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:48.055]  Meaning the guns.
[01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:49.017]  Who's coming to get the guns?
[01:15:50.168 --> 01:15:55.852]  And he breaks it down because, look, he trains with military, he trains with law enforcement, and he has for decades.
[01:15:56.213 --> 01:16:02.497]  He knows all the tactics, he knows all the people, he knows their attitudes, their belief systems, their loyalties.
[01:16:02.918 --> 01:16:05.199]  This guy knows what he is talking about.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:09.883]  The most qualified person to talk about this issue of gun confiscation, in my opinion.
[01:16:10.203 --> 01:16:10.863]  And he says,
[01:16:11.764 --> 01:16:18.326]  He says that, first of all, if the military were tasked with gun confiscation, here's what would happen.
[01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:27.610]  He says, quote, remember, these forces, the military forces, would have to come from a military base that is surrounded and supported by American communities.
[01:16:29.298 --> 01:16:34.663]  If the military began gun confiscation, the civilians would simply stop supporting the base.
[01:16:35.584 --> 01:16:43.110]  Cut off the fuel, food, electricity on the bases and it would stop the silliness, Paul Howe says in his article.
[01:16:43.991 --> 01:16:51.798]  And he says also many service members that live in those local communities would have to travel from their houses to their base unless they were locked down and
[01:16:53.914 --> 01:16:58.898]  The families in the community would not be too friendly to those engaging in gun confiscation.
[01:16:59.259 --> 01:17:02.381]  That's another way of saying you're not going to make it to the base, buddy.
[01:17:03.582 --> 01:17:07.125]  You may not even make it out of your house if you're one of these gun grabbers.
[01:17:08.426 --> 01:17:09.547]  Now, another quote.
[01:17:11.443 --> 01:17:19.709]  If the federal government tries to engage in gun confiscation, DHS or TSA, can you imagine the TSA trying to engage in gun confiscation?
[01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:24.152]  These pathetic people wouldn't last a day.
[01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:30.877]  They'd be outgunned by all the patriots and all the police officers and all the preppers in no time.
[01:17:31.057 --> 01:17:32.078]  TSA, give me a break.
[01:17:33.387 --> 01:17:35.369]  What are they going to do, raid our house with a latex glove?
[01:17:35.769 --> 01:17:36.050]  Really?
[01:17:37.391 --> 01:17:43.137]  Paul Howe writes, after the first few raids, the word would get out and Americans would start to fight back.
[01:17:43.297 --> 01:17:43.897]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:17:44.658 --> 01:17:51.445]  It would take one good ambush from a house or along a travel route to decimate a tactical force or make it combat ineffective.
[01:17:51.645 --> 01:17:51.865]  Yup!
[01:17:52.699 --> 01:17:53.480]  That's all it takes.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:18:02.725]  If you're going to try to declare war on the American people by taking away their guns, you're going to have a guerrilla war on your hands, and you're going to lose, you gun grabbers.
[01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:03.886]  You're going to lose big time.
[01:18:05.627 --> 01:18:07.188]  Paul Howe continues in his article.
[01:18:08.368 --> 01:18:13.131]  He says, quote, most federal agencies work out of a fixed location centrally located in a community.
[01:18:13.651 --> 01:18:15.753]  Ah yes, we know where you are.
[01:18:16.493 --> 01:18:17.634]  We know where you're based.
[01:18:18.817 --> 01:18:22.480]  And he goes on, those were my words, we know where you are, not Paul's words.
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.023]  But Paul goes on, also, their personnel live in those communities along with their families.
[01:18:27.523 --> 01:18:34.008]  Once the word got out that they were doing raids in violation to the Constitution, they and their families would be at risk.
[01:18:34.488 --> 01:18:38.792]  Yeah, they and their families would be more than at risk.
[01:18:39.732 --> 01:18:41.854]  They would probably have their homes burned out.
[01:18:42.494 --> 01:18:45.416]  Because think about it, think about it, if you're on a tactical
[01:18:46.553 --> 01:18:50.659]  Police team and you're conducting armed raids on houses around your community.
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:52.902]  They know where you live.
[01:18:53.703 --> 01:18:53.963]  They know.
[01:18:54.003 --> 01:18:54.784]  It's not a secret.
[01:18:55.105 --> 01:18:59.311]  Your names, if you're on a force that's doing that, they know where your homes are.
[01:18:59.731 --> 01:19:03.416]  You can expect your home to be burned out probably if this kind of thing gets going.
[01:19:04.444 --> 01:19:07.307]  You're putting yourself in danger, is what's going to happen.
[01:19:07.347 --> 01:19:13.312]  And most sheriffs and deputies and police officers are going to say, no way, I'm not doing that.
[01:19:14.233 --> 01:19:15.775]  Besides, I believe in the Constitution.
[01:19:15.815 --> 01:19:16.976]  I support the Second Amendment.
[01:19:16.996 --> 01:19:17.696]  That's what they're going to say.
[01:19:17.736 --> 01:19:20.499]  I'm not going to go run around and kick in people's doors.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.603]  Paul Howell continues, tactical teams could probably do only
[01:19:25.768 --> 01:19:27.789]  Eight to ten hits in a day, and then they would need a break.
[01:19:28.309 --> 01:19:29.089]  That's a lot of hits.
[01:19:29.829 --> 01:19:32.290]  So they hit ten houses and seize their guns, the word gets out!
[01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:34.170]  It would not go well.
[01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:46.554]  And if one or two determined Americans or combat vets fought back, the team would lose many, the TAC team would lose members to death or injury, and they would admit, and, well, they have to stop doing their raids because they're losing guys.
[01:19:46.874 --> 01:19:47.954]  That's the way it would really work.
[01:19:49.437 --> 01:19:50.059]  So there you go.

[01:20:18.895 --> 01:20:20.016]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[01:20:20.296 --> 01:20:28.949]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:33.096]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[01:20:33.316 --> 01:20:35.159]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.

[01:21:57.378 --> 01:22:03.580]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:11.822]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:12.163 --> 01:22:20.005]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:20.325 --> 01:22:25.066]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:25.406 --> 01:22:30.128]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:30.628 --> 01:22:34.489]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[01:23:09.828 --> 01:23:12.850]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:16.693]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game.
[01:23:17.673 --> 01:23:18.634]  But it's not Africa.
[01:23:18.974 --> 01:23:20.074]  It's Argentina.

[01:23:50.655 --> 01:23:52.256]  The big game hunting ranch.
[01:23:52.737 --> 01:23:54.899]  GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:17.350]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:21.592]  Alex is on an airplane headed to New York to be on a show tonight.
[01:24:21.993 --> 01:24:25.255]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[01:24:25.855 --> 01:24:26.956]  Sort of a last minute deal.
[01:24:27.497 --> 01:24:31.920]  He called me over the weekend and was like, hey Mike, can you fill in?
[01:24:33.666 --> 01:24:35.288]  Okay, you got it, you got it, man.
[01:24:35.588 --> 01:24:37.570]  Anything for the cause of liberty.
[01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.911]  So I am here.
[01:24:39.431 --> 01:24:42.434]  And by the way, a friend texted me over the break that we just had.
[01:24:43.255 --> 01:24:53.764]  And because earlier in the show, I sort of joked about Senator Feinstein kicking in doors and throwing flashbangs and engaging in her own gun confiscation.
[01:24:54.624 --> 01:24:58.288]  And my friend texted me and said, I'd pay good money to see that.
[01:24:59.008 --> 01:25:05.085]  I would pay money to see Senator Feinstein throwing a flashbang and kicking indoors and seizing guns.
[01:25:06.317 --> 01:25:07.038]  Yeah, we all would.
[01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:26.014]  Hey, Joe Rogan out there, you should get a pay-per-view thing set up with the UFC called the Ultimate Confiscation Championship and have Senator Feinstein and Schumer and Michael Moore and dress them up in body armor and put guns in their hands and have them try to kick it.
[01:25:26.034 --> 01:25:27.595]  They probably couldn't even kick in the door.
[01:25:27.615 --> 01:25:29.577]  They just couldn't even get that far.
[01:25:30.238 --> 01:25:31.699]  They'd kick the door and break an ankle.
[01:25:31.879 --> 01:25:32.460]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:33.581]  It would be that pathetic.
[01:25:34.281 --> 01:25:37.722]  But I think all these people talk about gun confiscation.
[01:25:38.283 --> 01:25:39.303]  Do it yourself, man.
[01:25:39.883 --> 01:25:41.624]  Don't hide behind a bunch of laws.
[01:25:41.684 --> 01:25:42.665]  You want to take our guns?
[01:25:43.765 --> 01:25:44.665]  Do it personally.
[01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:46.046]  Face to face.
[01:25:46.606 --> 01:25:48.027]  You know, bring it on.
[01:25:52.589 --> 01:25:53.649]  All right, oh man.
[01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:56.290]  Okay, DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:25:56.430 --> 01:25:57.251]  Top link.
[01:25:58.698 --> 01:25:59.259]  Showdown!
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:02.666]  Talk host Alex Jones detained by the TSA.
[01:26:02.746 --> 01:26:03.588]  This is true.
[01:26:03.608 --> 01:26:05.211]  This is top link on Drudge.
[01:26:06.433 --> 01:26:07.836]  And there's a picture of it.
[01:26:07.876 --> 01:26:09.419]  Go to DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:26:10.583 --> 01:26:18.727]  There's a picture of it, I guess another, looks like another passenger, traveler, grabbed this photo and sent it to Drudge.
[01:26:19.467 --> 01:26:26.270]  And Alex called me from the airplane right before I went on the air here, about 20 minutes before I went on the air today.
[01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:34.713]  He was very angry and he said that the TSA had detained him and threatened him with arrest.
[01:26:38.783 --> 01:26:39.143]  Oh really?
[01:26:39.844 --> 01:26:40.404]  Officer's name?
[01:26:41.765 --> 01:26:50.930]  Okay, John Bowne here just said that that's the same officer in the photo that detained or that threatened them when they were filming at the Austin Airport.
[01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:57.734]  So this, that officer, whoever that is, I don't know his name, apparently does not understand the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[01:26:59.076 --> 01:27:05.378]  And I guess we should thank that officer because what he did is he just sent Alex Jones to New York with extra steam.
[01:27:05.398 --> 01:27:07.159]  That's what he really did.
[01:27:08.659 --> 01:27:11.240]  But there's going to be a video on this later today.
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:13.901]  Alex filmed some of this on his iPhone, I've been told.
[01:27:14.821 --> 01:27:17.162]  And that video is going to be edited shortly.
[01:27:17.972 --> 01:27:18.833]  I don't know.
[01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:49.478]  People are fed up.
[01:27:50.078 --> 01:27:50.618]  I'm fed up.
[01:27:50.939 --> 01:27:51.559]  You're fed up.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.200]  Patriots are fed up.
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:55.542]  Gun owners are fed up with the insanity.
[01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.463]  And this is not going to last, folks.
[01:27:57.483 --> 01:27:58.904]  This is not going to last.
[01:27:59.004 --> 01:27:59.765]  Believe me.
[01:28:00.305 --> 01:28:07.871]  And in just a couple of minutes, we've got John Rappaport joining us by Skype to give us some additional thoughts on where this was all headed.
[01:28:08.271 --> 01:28:15.316]  But first, let me finish up this article about the Kool-Aid drinkers from Paul Howe, because he has a couple more quotes in here that are very powerful.
[01:28:15.336 --> 01:28:16.017]  I just want to get these in.
[01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:23.524]  Paul mentions, and Paul's a firearms instructor, one of the best, most widely recognized in the country.
[01:28:24.264 --> 01:28:28.448]  I believe he trains people at a facility here in Texas, in fact.
[01:28:29.829 --> 01:28:32.551]  He says that America is a nation of combat veterans and patriots.
[01:28:33.112 --> 01:28:46.343]  We have the guns and ammunitions out there and the talent to use them because thanks to the fact that we've been at war since about the early 1990s, our nation has effectively trained hundreds of thousands of soldiers
[01:28:47.023 --> 01:28:48.665]  How to use firearms.
[01:28:49.265 --> 01:28:55.631]  And those soldiers, their constitution, their loyalty is to the constitution to which they took an oath.
[01:28:56.271 --> 01:29:09.203]  So that's a very positive outcome of the fact that we've been at war, even though I don't support all the wars, but I am happy that our soldiers have gained the skills that come from conflict so that we can protect our liberties here at home.
[01:29:11.164 --> 01:29:13.607]  Paul Howe again, in every law enforcement, government,
[01:29:14.577 --> 01:29:20.280]  ...and military agency or branch, he says, there are a small number of Kool-Aid drinkers who would blindly follow orders.
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:29.805]  They would either be purged internally by their co-workers, he says, or the people they attacked would, quote, stop their gene pool.
[01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:36.568]  That's another... that's a euphemism for being terminated as a traitor to America.
[01:29:37.088 --> 01:29:38.169]  Those are the words of Paul Howe.
[01:29:39.608 --> 01:29:40.129]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.609]  Stay with us.
[01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:42.332]  John Rappaport coming up after this break.
[01:29:42.352 --> 01:29:43.934]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:43.974 --> 01:29:45.556]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in.

[01:33:02.219 --> 01:33:06.320]  You could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.921]  What do you mean, biblical?
[01:33:07.961 --> 01:33:10.261]  What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.
[01:33:10.421 --> 01:33:12.482]  Real wrath of God type stuff.
[01:33:12.542 --> 01:33:14.562]  Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
[01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:16.043]  Rivers and seas boiling.
[01:33:16.063 --> 01:33:17.003]  Forty years of darkness.
[01:33:17.083 --> 01:33:18.183]  Earthquakes, volcanoes.
[01:33:18.203 --> 01:33:19.704]  The dead rising from the grave.
[01:33:19.764 --> 01:33:20.924]  Human sacrifice.
[01:33:20.964 --> 01:33:22.665]  Dogs and cats living together.
[01:33:22.865 --> 01:33:23.705]  Mass hysteria!
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:34.429]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:36.290]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:33:37.271 --> 01:33:43.537]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:46.733 --> 01:33:50.876]  Alright, we've got details on the breaking news that's up at DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:33:51.036 --> 01:33:55.899]  Also posted at InfoWars.com, the article by Paul Joseph Watson just posted minutes ago.
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.661]  Alex Jones detained by the TSA.
[01:34:00.322 --> 01:34:13.431]  On his way to New York, Alex was approached by a TSA screener, one who knows the entire InfoWars crew very well, who said, hello Mr. Jones.
[01:34:14.764 --> 01:34:19.129]  Indicating that he knew who he was, and demanded that Alex Jones take off his shoes.
[01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:24.936]  Alex refused, saying that he was being discriminated against because he was a known critic of the TSA.
[01:34:26.818 --> 01:34:31.743]  The officer growled, and also Alex pointed out that the last time he had removed his shoes he had
[01:34:33.172 --> 01:34:37.494]  Uh, athlete's foot as a result because these places are filthy.
[01:34:37.534 --> 01:34:39.755]  Hey, they don't even change their latex gloves, okay?
[01:34:39.795 --> 01:34:44.236]  These, these tyrants, they just, they don't mind just infecting you with everything imaginable.
[01:34:44.257 --> 01:34:47.538]  It's kind of like a biological warfare little scheme there they have going.
[01:34:48.658 --> 01:34:51.319]  Jones said, I'm not taking my shoes off.
[01:34:51.459 --> 01:34:55.301]  The officer growled, take your damn shoes off or I'm gonna arrest you.
[01:34:56.862 --> 01:35:00.223]  And they continued to threaten to arrest Jones and prevent him from flying.
[01:35:03.358 --> 01:35:04.459]  They talked to other cops.
[01:35:07.399 --> 01:35:14.961]  Despite the officer seemingly wanting to take further action, TSA management said they eventually were happy to let Jones go on his way.
[01:35:16.142 --> 01:35:18.442]  Yeah, they know that it's all a bluff.
[01:35:18.562 --> 01:35:19.403]  It's all a bluff.
[01:35:19.963 --> 01:35:30.646]  They know they have no right to force you to take off your shoes, or pull down your pants, or take off your colostomy bag, or any of these other just humiliations
[01:35:31.886 --> 01:35:34.307]  That they push onto the American people.
[01:35:34.347 --> 01:35:35.207]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:35:35.227 --> 01:35:44.749]  So Alex Jones very nearly arrested today in Austin by a total TSA goon and a police officer.
[01:35:45.089 --> 01:35:45.429]  Apparently.
[01:35:45.529 --> 01:35:45.969]  No, wait a minute.
[01:35:45.989 --> 01:35:46.609]  Was that an officer?
[01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:47.749]  No, that was a TSA screener.
[01:35:47.789 --> 01:35:48.069]  Sorry.
[01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:51.890]  I think that the police officers have more sense, frankly.
[01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:54.111]  And we've seen that even in the Austin airport.
[01:35:54.151 --> 01:35:54.671]  The officers
[01:35:55.874 --> 01:36:01.456]  They know more about constitutional rights, but the TSA people, they are completely out of control.
[01:36:01.937 --> 01:36:03.617]  They are absolute traitors to America.
[01:36:03.637 --> 01:36:05.298]  And this is the reason I don't fly.
[01:36:05.898 --> 01:36:10.000]  Because I know that if I try to fly, they're going to put a little bag of cocaine in my carry-on.
[01:36:10.961 --> 01:36:14.482]  And they're going to arrest me for having a bag of cocaine or whatever they want to throw in there.
[01:36:14.782 --> 01:36:15.683]  Or they'll just make something up.
[01:36:16.482 --> 01:36:18.504]  You know, this is why I don't fly.
[01:36:19.405 --> 01:36:23.669]  And Alex Jones was able to, I mean, it's hard.
[01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:25.671]  You can't intimidate Alex Jones.
[01:36:25.731 --> 01:36:31.756]  So he, I'm sure he screamed back at them in their face, and that's the photo that is on this report by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:36:32.517 --> 01:36:33.758]  So Alex is on the plane.
[01:36:34.859 --> 01:36:36.101]  He made it through security.
[01:36:36.121 --> 01:36:39.344]  I mean, this is becoming Nazi, Nazi America, people.
[01:36:39.904 --> 01:36:41.426]  You know, these security checkpoints.
[01:36:43.019 --> 01:36:48.963]  Texas state troopers reaching down the pants of those women in that video that went public last week.
[01:36:49.644 --> 01:36:55.008]  Not even changing their gloves and going inside the bodies of two different women.
[01:36:55.448 --> 01:36:56.289]  It's insane.
[01:36:57.169 --> 01:36:59.191]  This is total tyranny.
[01:36:59.251 --> 01:37:00.832]  This is the definition of tyranny.
[01:37:01.653 --> 01:37:06.676]  Not even in North Korea do they go inside your body with latex gloves.
[01:37:06.716 --> 01:37:07.317]  It's unbelievable.
[01:37:08.137 --> 01:37:13.522]  Alright, we're joined by John Rappaport and John is joining us by Skype video.
[01:37:13.942 --> 01:37:19.426]  Oh man, we're showing... I can't watch that State Trooper video again.
[01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:22.349]  But John, welcome to the show today.
[01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:29.415]  First, let me ask you for your comments on that story that's just breaking right now on the Drudge Report and here at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:29.435 --> 01:37:30.516]  What are your thoughts on that?
[01:37:30.976 --> 01:37:35.719]  Well, I was just about, you know, echo what you said, Mike, because, I mean, it's completely insane.
[01:37:35.919 --> 01:37:37.980]  It's criminal all the way down the line.
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:45.664]  They've got a program, and the program is to put people into fear, and to say, we're in charge.
[01:37:46.144 --> 01:37:48.445]  You know, what better place to do this than an airport?
[01:37:49.286 --> 01:37:52.768]  Anytime you pass through here, any of our, quote, checkpoints,
[01:37:53.635 --> 01:37:56.956]  You're going to be grilled and drilled and whatever else we want to do to you.
[01:37:57.616 --> 01:38:02.698]  Or if it's a good day and we feel like just saying, hey, everything's fine, that's up to us.
[01:38:02.958 --> 01:38:03.899]  You have no power.
[01:38:03.959 --> 01:38:05.119]  We have all the power.
[01:38:05.139 --> 01:38:07.600]  Well, that's exactly it, John.
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.841]  The thing is, they knew Alex Jones.
[01:38:09.861 --> 01:38:11.201]  They called him by name.
[01:38:11.241 --> 01:38:13.382]  They approached him and said, hello, Alex.
[01:38:13.782 --> 01:38:18.524]  Remove your shoes because we are the powerful minions of the new world order.
[01:38:19.364 --> 01:38:20.925]  They just want to exercise power.
[01:38:21.766 --> 01:38:31.119]  We know who you are, we know you're a critic, and just so you understand, Alex, we're in charge, not you.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.382]  So that's the point that we're trying to make.
[01:38:35.031 --> 01:38:36.772]  They didn't make it because you got out of the play.
[01:38:36.932 --> 01:38:41.653]  It's the raw exercise of juvenile tyranny.
[01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:46.735]  These people, they must have such small little souls.
[01:38:46.795 --> 01:38:50.897]  They must be such children inside these TSA officers.
[01:38:50.917 --> 01:38:52.397]  I can't even call them officers.
[01:38:53.018 --> 01:38:53.958]  TSA goons.
[01:38:54.258 --> 01:38:54.718]  Thugs.
[01:38:54.878 --> 01:38:55.859]  Absolute thugs.
[01:38:56.619 --> 01:39:07.098]  They must be little, emotionally immature children inside to get off on making people take their shoes off when they know that person's not a threat.
[01:39:07.779 --> 01:39:08.480]  They know the person!
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.462]  Of course.
[01:39:10.182 --> 01:39:11.203]  They absolutely know that.
[01:39:11.703 --> 01:39:20.091]  And then you've got other people, because, I mean, I fly, I've seen TSA people who themselves are trapped in the system.
[01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:31.861]  Because, you know, they're broke, they're out of work, they can find a job, so they take the job and they're standing around, I've watched them, and they look at the whole charade and they're thinking to themselves, you can see it written on their face.
[01:39:32.702 --> 01:39:35.486]  This is complete insanity, but I have to pick up a paycheck.
[01:39:36.207 --> 01:39:37.408]  And so they do this, right?
[01:39:37.649 --> 01:39:43.517]  And when I've talked to them, I can see that they know I know, and I know they know I know.
[01:39:43.557 --> 01:39:45.219]  You know, this is all insane, right?
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.242]  And yeah, that's what's going on.
[01:39:48.523 --> 01:39:50.226]  It's the police state in action.
[01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:54.707]  Yeah, well, and they're standing around irradiating themselves, giving themselves cancer.
[01:39:54.747 --> 01:40:04.955]  Which, I guess, in a funny kind of Darwinist kind of way, they are actually eliminating themselves from the future human gene pool through infertility, and they don't even know it.
[01:40:04.975 --> 01:40:06.096]  They're so uninformed.
[01:40:06.536 --> 01:40:09.278]  What was it Melissa Melton was telling me this morning when I walked through here?
[01:40:09.959 --> 01:40:19.867]  She said that there was a TSA agent who told her that the machines, they don't emit radiation, they only emit x-rays.
[01:40:21.170 --> 01:40:21.851]  Oh, great!
[01:40:22.231 --> 01:40:22.932]  Yeah, really!
[01:40:22.952 --> 01:40:26.075]  Well, got that now, from the top of the food chain.
[01:40:26.596 --> 01:40:28.998]  No x-rays, I mean, no radiation, just x-rays.
[01:40:29.038 --> 01:40:37.707]  Only x-rays, yeah, because in their minds, x-rays are not radiation, and, you know... Of course, because... Where do you find these people?
[01:40:38.768 --> 01:40:43.113]  Do you put out ads to say, you know, maximum IQ allowed, 72?
[01:40:44.675 --> 01:40:49.245]  Or answer this question, are x-rays and radiation the same thing?
[01:40:49.285 --> 01:40:51.129]  If it says no, you got a job, baby!
[01:40:53.412 --> 01:40:55.934]  Oh man, you ask them, what is the table of elements?
[01:40:55.954 --> 01:40:58.095]  And they think that's the place where they eat in the break room.
[01:41:00.077 --> 01:41:03.999]  Oh my god, we're being ruled by morons!
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:07.602]  Twinkie element on the chart, yeah.
[01:41:08.122 --> 01:41:09.163]  It's completely insane.
[01:41:09.743 --> 01:41:12.165]  And it's like, Alex Jones, take off your shoes!
[01:41:13.145 --> 01:41:22.632]  We know who you are, we know you're a national radio host, we know you're no threat to anybody, we know you've never been arrested, you have no criminal record, we know you, but take off your damn shoes or I'm gonna arrest you, that's a quote.
[01:41:23.352 --> 01:41:24.053]  That's incredible.
[01:41:25.013 --> 01:41:26.174]  Yeah.
[01:41:27.135 --> 01:41:32.159]  Do we have any, I'm sure there's no, nobody was there taking video of this, were they?
[01:41:32.679 --> 01:41:37.783]  Alex was taking video and he said he's gonna upload it so we're gonna get to see some video tonight.
[01:41:37.923 --> 01:41:44.107]  It's not during this broadcast because Alex is on the plane and it's not landing for another, I don't know, hour or whatever.
[01:41:44.568 --> 01:41:48.531]  So tonight there will be video and I can't wait to see it personally.
[01:41:48.831 --> 01:41:50.232]  I'm just, you know,
[01:41:51.215 --> 01:41:52.616]  I think it'll be a great lesson.
[01:41:53.136 --> 01:41:58.178]  But the other point is, if it was someone other than Alex Jones, they would have been arrested.
[01:41:58.238 --> 01:42:04.541]  You see, they let Alex go because they knew what would happen if they arrested Alex Jones.
[01:42:05.022 --> 01:42:05.522]  Exactly.
[01:42:06.122 --> 01:42:12.005]  So if it was just somebody who said, no, you can't make me take off my shoes, that guy's in jail.
[01:42:12.205 --> 01:42:12.926]  Right, exactly.
[01:42:13.226 --> 01:42:13.646]  Exactly.
[01:42:14.527 --> 01:42:19.330]  So even Alex only got through there by his wits and his notoriety.
[01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:29.878]  If it had been someone who wasn't well-known, they would have been in jail and probably, you know, punched in the face, beat up, and whatever, tortured, who knows, or even sometimes killed.
[01:42:29.898 --> 01:42:32.780]  You know, they've been killed after being detained at the airport.
[01:42:33.959 --> 01:42:38.202]  Or somebody would say, well, this is prima facie evidence that you're a terrorist.
[01:42:39.103 --> 01:42:40.684]  Because you wouldn't take off your shoes, right?
[01:42:40.704 --> 01:42:42.926]  Right, yeah, you have al-Qaeda shoes on.
[01:42:43.226 --> 01:42:47.690]  I see your al-Qaeda hushpuppies.
[01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:50.252]  Let's go on to the other issues today.
[01:42:50.772 --> 01:42:56.637]  It's infuriating how much tyranny we are suffering under in America today.
[01:42:57.998 --> 01:43:04.084]  All these liberals, I gotta say, they think the answer is more tyranny.
[01:43:04.124 --> 01:43:05.645]  The answer is more government.
[01:43:05.966 --> 01:43:08.668]  The answer is to take away more rights from the people.
[01:43:08.728 --> 01:43:12.472]  Put all the guns in the hands of the worst goons imaginable.
[01:43:13.112 --> 01:43:14.053]  People like the TSA.
[01:43:14.073 --> 01:43:16.175]  Can you imagine if the TSA were armed?
[01:43:17.937 --> 01:43:18.457]  Oh yeah.
[01:43:18.497 --> 01:43:22.101]  Well, that's another incident and they will be armed.
[01:43:23.299 --> 01:43:24.139]  I'm sure that's the plan.
[01:43:24.299 --> 01:43:27.161]  I'm sure that's what some of the 1.6 billion bullets are for.
[01:43:27.721 --> 01:43:29.102]  The .40 caliber hollow points.
[01:43:29.442 --> 01:43:30.643]  They're going to arm the TSA.
[01:43:31.663 --> 01:43:39.068]  Which, you know, that's going to be interesting because I bet these people can't hit the side of a barn with a firearm.
[01:43:40.929 --> 01:43:42.450]  Guns fired in the airport.
[01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:45.691]  Five innocent spectators killed, you know?
[01:43:46.092 --> 01:43:47.072]  Right, right.
[01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:56.551]  I'm sorry to get off topic, but let's get back on... No, no, listen, I mean, this is completely on topic, because it's happening right now.
[01:43:56.791 --> 01:43:59.014]  Well, yeah, it is happening right now.
[01:43:59.335 --> 01:43:59.655]  You know what?
[01:44:00.075 --> 01:44:01.698]  Let's open up the call queue, guys.
[01:44:05.261 --> 01:44:06.802]  Let's open it up.
[01:44:06.822 --> 01:44:11.623]  Let me get out the number 1-800-259-9231.
[01:44:11.643 --> 01:44:11.823]  800-259-9231.
[01:44:11.863 --> 01:44:23.046]  If you've got a question or comment for John Rappaport or myself, a comment about Alex Jones being detained and threatened with arrest this morning at the Austin Airport, or comments about
[01:44:23.826 --> 01:44:25.187]  Gun rights, you name it.
[01:44:25.848 --> 01:44:27.229]  Call in, we'll take some calls.
[01:44:27.549 --> 01:44:29.050]  Now, let's get to the article.
[01:44:29.311 --> 01:44:30.532]  I gotta give you credit for this, John.
[01:44:31.192 --> 01:44:32.093]  You called me yesterday.
[01:44:32.113 --> 01:44:34.155]  We had a short conversation on the phone.
[01:44:34.815 --> 01:44:49.748]  You brought up this idea that the prescription drug records of patients all across America could be used to label everyone that's on antidepressants, for example, as being mentally unfit to own firearms and then deny them the right to own or possess firearms.
[01:44:50.583 --> 01:44:51.163]  Absolutely.
[01:44:51.523 --> 01:44:53.604]  And then you took off from that.
[01:44:53.745 --> 01:44:55.966]  I mean, this just knocked me over.
[01:44:56.806 --> 01:45:05.170]  That you've discovered that there is indeed one giant database of, you know, Americans who are on medical drugs.
[01:45:05.610 --> 01:45:06.751]  Yes.
[01:45:06.871 --> 01:45:11.673]  I took your idea, and I did some additional research on it last night, and I found
[01:45:12.293 --> 01:45:27.706]  This National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act, NASPR, signed into law by George Bush in 2005, and then a multi-state data sharing prescription drug surveillance program now run by 48 states that goes by a different name, which is funded by the U.S.
[01:45:27.726 --> 01:45:33.591]  Department of Justice, and the website is pmpalliance.org, pmpalliance.org.
[01:45:33.611 --> 01:45:38.255]  So I've got to give you credit, John, for bringing this up, and I think it's a huge story.
[01:45:38.595 --> 01:45:39.036]  Your thoughts?
[01:45:39.827 --> 01:45:40.587]  That's gigantic!
[01:45:41.228 --> 01:45:53.075]  I mean, I have to assume, Mike, without having actually looked at this database, because I'm sure I can't get into it, but whoever can get into it is going to be able to find out the names of people.
[01:45:54.156 --> 01:45:54.316]  Right?
[01:45:54.356 --> 01:45:55.136]  You take the drugs.
[01:45:55.176 --> 01:45:57.138]  Otherwise, what good is the database, right?
[01:45:57.258 --> 01:45:59.279]  No, it's got to have your name and the drugs that you're taking.
[01:45:59.379 --> 01:46:00.880]  That's in the database.
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:02.261]  That's the whole point of the database.
[01:46:02.781 --> 01:46:05.503]  So therefore, inferring from that,
[01:46:06.670 --> 01:46:21.142]  Somebody knows right away, right now, what psychiatric medications Adam Lanza was on, James Holmes was on, any one of these people that, you know, I've been knocking on this door, and you have, and other people, who's the guy's doctor?
[01:46:21.202 --> 01:46:23.083]  What psychiatric meds was he on?
[01:46:23.123 --> 01:46:27.007]  Let's find out, because we know these medications induce violence.
[01:46:27.467 --> 01:46:33.412]  Well, now you've proved people already know, people who have access to the database, they could tell us.
[01:46:35.274 --> 01:46:44.562]  And there's this article this morning in WorldNetDaily by David Kopelian that he calls it the giant gaping hole in Sandy Hook reporting where they're not talking about the prescription drugs.
[01:46:44.942 --> 01:46:52.208]  They don't want us to know what drugs they were on because if we knew, then they couldn't blame the guns, John.
[01:46:52.969 --> 01:46:53.489]  Exactly.
[01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:55.511]  They have to blame the guns.
[01:46:56.331 --> 01:46:56.852]  Exactly.
[01:46:56.932 --> 01:46:58.653]  So they don't want to say, they won't say,
[01:46:59.625 --> 01:47:03.627]  The drug companies are in on this because the drug companies want to blame guns, too.
[01:47:04.227 --> 01:47:12.552]  I mean, the drug companies are behind gun control because that deflects all responsibility away from the psychiatric drugs.
[01:47:12.612 --> 01:47:12.952]  Oh, right.
[01:47:13.512 --> 01:47:21.156]  So you've got this giant, you know, juggernaut monopoly, corporate government, etc., all against the guns.
[01:47:21.256 --> 01:47:22.337]  Let's take away the guns.
[01:47:22.417 --> 01:47:23.237]  We know it's the guns.
[01:47:23.317 --> 01:47:25.999]  Of course, the guns jump off the shelves and kill people themselves.
[01:47:26.679 --> 01:47:27.920]  It's not the drugs.
[01:47:28.539 --> 01:47:41.469]  No, it's not the drugs that alter the mind that controls the muscles that move the finger that touches the trigger that actuates the firing pin that strikes the primer.
[01:47:41.909 --> 01:47:43.530]  No, it's not any of that.
[01:47:43.951 --> 01:47:52.297]  The gun is a magic device, a magical device that leaps out of a holster and starts shooting children all by itself at like some kind of
[01:47:53.778 --> 01:47:55.799]  Anime horror film or something.
[01:47:55.859 --> 01:47:56.199]  I don't know.
[01:47:56.739 --> 01:47:57.219]  It's bizarre.
[01:47:57.499 --> 01:47:58.960]  Let's go to calls, John, if you're up for it.
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:00.040]  Sure, let's go.
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:02.301]  All right, let's... Mark from Oregon.
[01:48:02.321 --> 01:48:03.401]  You're on the line.
[01:48:04.041 --> 01:48:05.002]  Welcome to the show, Mark.
[01:48:05.182 --> 01:48:05.842]  What's on your mind?
[01:48:06.922 --> 01:48:08.243]  Welcome to my home, gentlemen.
[01:48:08.323 --> 01:48:10.083]  I really appreciate all your great work.
[01:48:10.123 --> 01:48:10.683]  You're wonderful.
[01:48:11.504 --> 01:48:12.284]  Thank you.
[01:48:13.224 --> 01:48:14.065]  You're most welcome.
[01:48:14.125 --> 01:48:14.945]  Thank you so much.
[01:48:15.185 --> 01:48:16.645]  Couldn't do any more than you've done.
[01:48:16.665 --> 01:48:18.206]  Hey, we're just like you.
[01:48:18.226 --> 01:48:19.326]  We're just fighting for liberty here.
[01:48:19.346 --> 01:48:19.766]  That's it.
[01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:20.247]  That's it.
[01:48:24.795 --> 01:48:26.656]  Well, that's because we are real Americans.
[01:48:26.716 --> 01:48:28.257]  We are the real America, you know?
[01:48:28.658 --> 01:48:33.881]  We are the ones who broke off from tyranny and we're going to defend the Constitution that we were built on.
[01:48:33.921 --> 01:48:34.281]  That's it.
[01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:34.922]  Bottom line.
[01:48:35.002 --> 01:48:35.542]  End of story.
[01:48:36.123 --> 01:48:37.684]  We have to move into the spirit of 1776.
[01:48:39.285 --> 01:48:39.805]  Absolutely.
[01:48:41.686 --> 01:48:49.632]  Mike and John, I called in today about the, it's based around the Sandy Hook shooting and there are two
[01:48:50.319 --> 01:49:12.438]  Areas I'd like to cover very quickly if I could, and one is the situational basis and the legal basis of what everything is being revolved on against us as the American people, being prepared to go into physical slavery relative to this last death which occurs historically.
[01:49:13.266 --> 01:49:17.969]  Before the actual physical enslavement of the people of a nation.
[01:49:18.089 --> 01:49:21.452]  Right, we're going through the cycle of civilizations right now, and you're right.
[01:49:21.472 --> 01:49:25.695]  We're at that point of enslavement, which is usually followed by revolution, by the way, historically.
[01:49:26.539 --> 01:49:40.009]  So realizing how important this is, if I have the time to cover these two, I think it would enlighten you and the audience, because it's just the conglomeration and the result of all the information I've taken in, which is substantial from good men such as yourself.
[01:49:40.049 --> 01:49:41.450]  Well, hit him as fast as you can.
[01:49:41.530 --> 01:49:41.830]  Go ahead.
[01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:43.271]  Get right into it.
[01:49:43.772 --> 01:49:53.799]  In the situational basis, you have the glaring inconsistencies all around the Aurora shooting in Aurora, Colorado, the movie theater, as well as Sandy Hook.
[01:49:54.505 --> 01:49:55.025]  I don't think so.
[01:50:14.253 --> 01:50:25.175]  So, but you have this existing in the Aurora, Colorado shooting in various places, as well as up on the screen, the Joker points on a map to Sandy Hook.
[01:50:25.496 --> 01:50:27.656]  Let me ask John to comment on that, Mark.
[01:50:27.696 --> 01:50:28.816]  That's a really great point.
[01:50:28.836 --> 01:50:31.017]  John has done more research on this than most others.
[01:50:31.037 --> 01:50:36.278]  You know, this business with the Sandy Hook map in The Dark Knight Rises and Gary Oldman
[01:50:36.938 --> 01:50:40.400]  The police commissioner, Gordon, pointing to it in the movie.
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:41.681]  Hey, we gotta go out to break, John.
[01:50:41.741 --> 01:50:44.923]  Sorry to interrupt you, but continue to answer that on the other side of this break.
[01:50:44.943 --> 01:50:46.024]  And thank you for your call, Mark.
[01:50:46.064 --> 01:50:53.728]  We will be right back with John's answer to the inconsistencies in the shootings that continue to happen as a pretext for gun control in America.
[01:50:54.129 --> 01:50:55.589]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:55.609 --> 01:50:56.190]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:57.967 --> 01:51:01.849]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[01:51:01.949 --> 01:51:09.172]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[01:51:09.472 --> 01:51:11.853]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:51:12.173 --> 01:51:18.516]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:51:18.756 --> 01:51:19.897]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[01:51:20.177 --> 01:51:28.820]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:32.961]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[01:51:33.161 --> 01:51:35.022]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.
[01:51:35.242 --> 01:51:37.403]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[01:52:09.102 --> 01:52:12.986]  Introducing Afterburner Stoves, home of the original patented rocket stove
[01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:13.726]  We're good.

[01:54:06.732 --> 01:54:10.337]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[01:54:14.094 --> 01:54:36.930]  Alright, in the next hour, by the way, Aaron Dykes is going to be taking over the broadcast at the bottom of the hour and covering some historical quotes on the Second Amendment and really breaking down where the Second Amendment comes from and why it is merely a confirmation of a sacred right that we're born with.
[01:54:37.271 --> 01:54:38.652]  A birthright, in other words.
[01:54:38.732 --> 01:54:41.294]  And he's going to have a very interesting collection of quotes of both
[01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:47.673]  Patriots as well as historical gun grabbers such as Stalin.
[01:54:48.534 --> 01:54:49.615]  Well, they love guns too.
[01:54:49.915 --> 01:54:54.698]  They just love them in their own hands, not in the hands of the actual people.
[01:54:55.178 --> 01:55:03.063]  In any case, we are taking calls right now with John Rappaport, the author of a wonderful new article that's posted up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:55:04.284 --> 01:55:22.156]  It talks about psychiatry becoming the new police, where this national prescription drug database that we've now confirmed exists could be used to deny you the right to own a firearm or even other rights, perhaps the right to free speech, perhaps the right to have a website.
[01:55:23.092 --> 01:55:26.314]  If you're on antidepressants or other drugs.
[01:55:26.354 --> 01:55:30.137]  So this could be used against you in the days and months ahead.
[01:55:30.257 --> 01:55:32.738]  John, welcome back to the show.
[01:55:32.758 --> 01:55:36.081]  Do you want to continue with that question that was posed right before the break?
[01:55:37.125 --> 01:55:52.536]  Yeah, this has to do with this boggling coincidence, in heavy quotes, in the movie The Dark Knight Rises, where Commissioner Gordon, the character, is pointing to a map that says Sandy Hook in big letters on it.
[01:55:52.616 --> 01:55:58.381]  You can't see anything else on the map, you can't read anything else, and he's pointing to that, talking about an attack.
[01:56:00.362 --> 01:56:07.626]  You know, this is just one of a list of boggling, quote, coincidences tied to the Sandy Hook murders that I wrote about.
[01:56:07.666 --> 01:56:27.877]  Well, this morning, I come across a piece, and it looks solid to me so far, that the property master on the film, The Dark Knight Rises, the guy responsible for all the props, like maps and so forth, and bringing them in, a guy named Scott Gessinger,
[01:56:29.571 --> 01:56:37.977]  He died in an auto accident in April of 2012, several months before Sandy Hook and so forth.
[01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:45.083]  And he died in a mysterious auto accident in Newtown, Connecticut.
[01:56:45.323 --> 01:56:45.803]  No way.
[01:56:46.884 --> 01:56:47.144]  Right?
[01:56:47.444 --> 01:56:49.546]  Alright, so I understand that's still preliminary.
[01:56:49.566 --> 01:56:50.747]  You're going to check it out some more.
[01:56:50.787 --> 01:56:55.050]  Yeah, but I saw the article in a Connecticut paper.
[01:56:56.676 --> 01:57:04.039]  That said he died in April of 2012 in the accident, gave his name, said he was the property master on the Dark Knight Rises.
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:07.801]  This wasn't, I mean, it was just a regular local newspaper.
[01:57:07.981 --> 01:57:08.861]  Yeah, here's the story.
[01:57:08.901 --> 01:57:17.945]  It's up on screen here, that Scott Getzinger was killed Friday night in a head-on collision in Stamford, Connecticut, when his truck was struck by a car.
[01:57:18.446 --> 01:57:21.127]  His credits include the Dark Knight Rises.
[01:57:22.025 --> 01:57:23.146]  Property Master, yeah.
[01:57:23.266 --> 01:57:24.167]  And Men in Black.
[01:57:24.867 --> 01:57:26.588]  And Men in Black and many other movies.
[01:57:26.849 --> 01:57:27.189]  Wow.
[01:57:27.649 --> 01:57:31.912]  I'm just adding that to the boggling, you know, list of coincidences here.
[01:57:32.092 --> 01:57:36.596]  Well, I know the map you're talking about, the Batman map, the Gotham City map that has Sandy Hook on it.
[01:57:36.656 --> 01:57:45.783]  I remember seeing that map and it actually has, it has circled in red the area on the map that is that school.
[01:57:46.363 --> 01:57:48.405]  And that it has written in red something like
[01:57:49.325 --> 01:57:51.588]  Uh, the first strike point or something, right?
[01:57:51.608 --> 01:57:52.669]  Strike zone one.
[01:57:52.689 --> 01:57:55.352]  Yeah, strike zone one, pointing to the school.
[01:57:55.932 --> 01:57:59.776]  Yeah, I mean, so people say, well, this is just, you know, obviously an accident.
[01:57:59.816 --> 01:58:01.578]  I mean, it couldn't be anything more than that.
[01:58:02.279 --> 01:58:08.685]  But you keep piling these up and you get a storyline that is just, uh, I mean...
[01:58:09.537 --> 01:58:09.817]  Absolutely.
[01:58:09.837 --> 01:58:10.898]  It boggles your mind, right?
[01:58:10.998 --> 01:58:18.260]  And as you wrote in your article, Mike, you know, if somebody had said 15, 20 years ago, guess what?
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:25.663]  We're going to have airports where we're going to have basically cops strip-searching you and examining your orifices.
[01:58:25.963 --> 01:58:27.344]  Yeah, we're going to go to break again, John.
[01:58:27.364 --> 01:58:30.205]  How boggling is this?
[01:58:30.305 --> 01:58:33.926]  Well, I hate to interrupt such a fascinating sentence, but we'll be right back after this break.
[01:58:33.946 --> 01:58:34.666]  Stay with us, John.
[01:58:34.906 --> 01:58:36.327]  We'll continue on the Alex Jones Show.

[02:00:14.650 --> 02:00:18.712]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.970 --> 02:00:25.571]  Welcome to the third hour of this broadcast today on Monday, January 7, 2013.
[02:00:25.951 --> 02:00:35.334]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex Jones, who is on an airplane right now headed to New York to appear on mainstream media today.
[02:00:36.235 --> 02:00:38.555]  And John Rappaport is our guest right now.
[02:00:38.855 --> 02:00:46.398]  And if you're just joining us, Alex Jones was nearly arrested this morning at the Austin airport after being threatened with arrest by
[02:00:48.419 --> 02:00:52.500]  Some TSA goons there who demanded that he take off his shoes.
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:56.981]  They knew him by name, they approached him by name, said, hi Alex, take your shoes off.
[02:00:57.941 --> 02:01:01.281]  And I have now been informed of the reason why.
[02:01:01.521 --> 02:01:05.562]  Alex was hiding in his shoes the Dianne Feinstein sock puppet.
[02:01:06.942 --> 02:01:07.642]  And here it is.
[02:01:08.103 --> 02:01:11.543]  We have a copy of the Dianne Feinstein sock puppet right here in studio today.
[02:01:11.563 --> 02:01:15.544]  And let's see what Dianne Feinstein has to say on camera.
[02:01:16.303 --> 02:01:20.347]  I'm gonna raid your homes and throw flashbangs and take your guns!
[02:01:22.569 --> 02:01:23.069]  Yeah!
[02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.770]  Yeah!
[02:01:24.611 --> 02:01:29.075]  Alright, sorry John, you didn't get a chance to see that, but we actually do have a Feinstein sock puppet.
[02:01:29.736 --> 02:01:30.917]  And she's quite animated.
[02:01:31.598 --> 02:01:34.420]  Alex told me he was gonna take that inside his shoes, you know.
[02:01:36.062 --> 02:01:37.803]  That's the secret weapon, comedy.
[02:01:37.823 --> 02:01:38.744]  That is the secret weapon.
[02:01:38.764 --> 02:01:40.126]  He was hiding comedy in his shoes.
[02:01:40.925 --> 02:01:41.785]  Well, that's a crime.
[02:01:42.106 --> 02:01:43.366]  You can't do that.
[02:01:43.927 --> 02:01:50.930]  You know, everything that you're talking about, Mike, especially with what's happening here with Alex, imagine this now, up in the future.
[02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:58.554]  You go to fly, and they type in your name, and they get that medical drug database that you were talking about.
[02:01:58.774 --> 02:01:59.094]  Right.
[02:01:59.634 --> 02:02:01.715]  They say, okay, here is so-and-so.
[02:02:02.496 --> 02:02:05.477]  We see he's taking Prozac, Zoloft, well, he's a mental case.
[02:02:06.778 --> 02:02:09.219]  So, we have to be very careful about this guy.
[02:02:09.824 --> 02:02:37.772]  We have to, you know, please take him in a room, we have to ask him questions, examine him, look at his papers, you know, because now, with all these databases connected, whether it's, you know, about gun ownership, about medication, psychiatric meds and so forth, they're just constructing one gigantic database, so at the airport, or any travel checkpoint, they will be able to completely profile you in many ways that you don't even imagine, and then decide whether or not you can travel.
[02:02:38.072 --> 02:02:40.114]  Well no, let me tell you, this is a true story.
[02:02:40.154 --> 02:02:43.456]  James Stewart, the raw milkman from California, they profiled him.
[02:02:43.476 --> 02:02:47.980]  They had him flagged in the California database as a quote, sovereign.
[02:02:48.981 --> 02:02:52.404]  And this is a new checkbox they have for criminals, so-called criminals.
[02:02:52.424 --> 02:02:56.647]  You know, this guy all he did was distribute milk and cheese that the state didn't like.
[02:02:57.267 --> 02:03:01.351]  And so they flagged him with the word sovereign, and then when they booked him into L.A.
[02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:02.412]  County Jail,
[02:03:03.297 --> 02:03:12.279]  He said one of the booking guard staff members there looked up from his computer, backed away from his desk, and said, oh my god, you attack guards!
[02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:29.722]  And so, just being flagged as a sovereign now, and then they bound him with chains on his feet and his arms and they put him in an isolation room, a very cold room, no light, you know, very cold, hypothermia almost, he suffered from that, starvation.
[02:03:29.742 --> 02:03:35.807]  I mean, they can flag you with anything now, John, and then treat you worse than you'd be treated in a third world country.
[02:03:36.633 --> 02:03:37.215]  Absolutely.
[02:03:37.836 --> 02:03:42.347]  So if they see, okay, this guy's taking psychiatric drugs or whatever, okay, let's not let him fly.
[02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.971]  Or let's arrest him.
[02:03:44.904 --> 02:03:57.337]  If he causes any trouble or objects to what we're doing to him, let's provoke him, in other words, and see how he reacts, and then we'll, you know, put him in lock-up because he's a psychiatric patient.
[02:03:57.717 --> 02:04:07.367]  I mean, all of these things can be manipulated any way they want to manipulate it, and when they say the word sovereign, you know, which is now a code word for them for terrorism,
[02:04:07.947 --> 02:04:10.469]  All they're really saying is this is an independent mind.
[02:04:10.630 --> 02:04:11.370]  Yeah, right, right.
[02:04:11.771 --> 02:04:15.314]  So we have to, we have to kill that off because that's the biggest threat to the country.
[02:04:15.854 --> 02:04:19.117]  We got, uh, Dianne Feinstein wants to say something else, the sock puppet.
[02:04:19.458 --> 02:04:26.284]  Mr. and Mrs. America, we're gonna, we're gonna profile your prescription drugs and use it to take away your rights!
[02:04:27.992 --> 02:04:28.392]  Okay.
[02:04:28.512 --> 02:04:32.453]  Has she, by the way, given up her security guards with guns?
[02:04:32.493 --> 02:04:35.334]  No, no, they're all armed and they're probably all on psych drugs as well.
[02:04:35.414 --> 02:04:40.716]  By the way, we're going to take calls when we come back, so Lori, Bill, Jason, Nick, Greg and others stay with us.
[02:04:41.056 --> 02:04:43.656]  We'll take calls when we come back in the next segment with John Rappaport.
[02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:45.597]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:45.617 --> 02:04:47.897]  We'll be right back and we'll get more serious when we get back.
[02:04:48.258 --> 02:04:50.698]  Enough of these Feinstein sock puppets, okay?
[02:04:51.218 --> 02:04:51.879]  Get them out of here!
[02:04:51.899 --> 02:04:53.119]  Alright, we'll be back.

[02:06:07.572 --> 02:06:13.957]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[02:06:14.157 --> 02:06:19.580]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:23.483]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.

[02:08:06.881 --> 02:08:10.565]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:21.263 --> 02:08:23.225]  All right, we're continuing on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:23.265 --> 02:08:42.561]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, editor of NaturalNews.com, joined by John Rappaport, our guest right now from NoMoreFakeNews.com, and we're taking calls from people on all the issues of the day, including Alex Jones almost being arrested this morning at the Austin airport as a TSA tyrant demanded that he take off his shoes.
[02:08:44.387 --> 02:08:48.770]  Because I guess shoes are just too much for the globalists to bear.
[02:08:49.190 --> 02:08:50.411]  You can't have shoes, John.
[02:08:50.651 --> 02:08:51.132]  Did you know that?
[02:08:51.192 --> 02:08:58.778]  Not only can you not have guns, but you can't have shoes because they need to have the exclusive right to stomp on you with their boots.
[02:08:59.218 --> 02:09:00.199]  So you can't have shoes.
[02:09:00.219 --> 02:09:01.220]  Does that make any sense to you?
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:02.621]  That's right, yeah.
[02:09:02.761 --> 02:09:06.164]  It makes perfect sense to me if the world is completely insane, yeah.
[02:09:07.444 --> 02:09:08.405]  And apparently it is.
[02:09:08.925 --> 02:09:09.645]  Apparently it is.
[02:09:09.845 --> 02:09:11.466]  Are you up for taking calls or you got a comment for us?
[02:09:11.486 --> 02:09:11.986]  Yeah, let's go.
[02:09:12.266 --> 02:09:14.387]  All right, let's go to Lori in West Virginia.
[02:09:14.887 --> 02:09:15.907]  Lori, welcome to the show.
[02:09:15.967 --> 02:09:16.748]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:09:16.968 --> 02:09:17.768]  What's on your mind?
[02:09:17.788 --> 02:09:19.489]  Hey Mike, it's Don.
[02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:23.210]  I'm calling in because I'm part of a farm extension.
[02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:25.711]  Well, I'm a member of the farm extension.
[02:09:26.231 --> 02:09:29.833]  And we were trying to start a program for the farm to schools.
[02:09:29.893 --> 02:09:32.154]  Have you heard of that?
[02:09:32.474 --> 02:09:33.394]  Not in West Virginia.
[02:09:33.434 --> 02:09:35.975]  I mean, just generally speaking, I've heard of those kinds of programs.
[02:09:36.505 --> 02:09:41.992]  Okay, they're trying to take where we supply, the small local farmers supply food to the school kids.
[02:09:42.473 --> 02:09:52.545]  Well, when it first started and we had our meeting, the representative from the school, the purchaser, she brought her little price list of what she's paying the big shipping companies for food.
[02:09:53.463 --> 02:09:57.764]  And on there, at first, the price list seemed like, OK, we could do this.
[02:09:57.864 --> 02:09:58.825]  We can afford to do this.
[02:09:58.885 --> 02:10:01.986]  It's not going to be that great big profit, but we can do this.
[02:10:02.086 --> 02:10:09.748]  And then we had another meeting four months later, and just like in the first meeting, a dozen of eggs was going for $3 for them.
[02:10:11.048 --> 02:10:14.629]  The second meeting, now they're paying $1 for eggs.
[02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:18.611]  And yeah, and the whole price list went down like that.
[02:10:18.811 --> 02:10:21.091]  So it's kind of like they're trying to bankrupt the local farms then?
[02:10:21.111 --> 02:10:22.632]  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.
[02:10:23.463 --> 02:10:28.104]  ...a lot longer than we can, you know, and then everybody got discouraged and said, oh, we can't do this.
[02:10:28.184 --> 02:10:42.448]  Well, anyway, another reason why I'm calling is because in the newspaper yesterday, here at the Charleston Gazette-Mail, they have an article that says the FDA proposes sweeping new food safety rules for outbreaks.
[02:10:42.708 --> 02:10:48.469]  And in the article, it says that it's going to cost
[02:10:51.339 --> 02:10:59.424]  Yep, it's true.
[02:10:59.444 --> 02:11:03.987]  Let's go to John on that with the comment, and thank you for your call, Lori, and for your question.
[02:11:04.087 --> 02:11:10.051]  But John, this is a big epidemic year for the flu virus, but it's hitting mostly those people who are vaccinated.
[02:11:10.091 --> 02:11:11.672]  That's the thing the CDC won't admit.
[02:11:12.512 --> 02:11:12.993]  What do you think, man?
[02:11:14.298 --> 02:11:14.758]  Well, sure.
[02:11:14.858 --> 02:11:24.081]  I mean, what better way to pump up an epidemic than to give people an unnecessary and dangerous vaccine that actually causes what you're supposedly preventing.
[02:11:24.161 --> 02:11:24.401]  Yes.
[02:11:24.642 --> 02:11:30.203]  And then you come in behind that and you say, wow, we have a heavy epidemic year, so everybody's got to get vaccinated.
[02:11:30.323 --> 02:11:30.924]  No, you nailed it.
[02:11:30.984 --> 02:11:33.364]  Vaccines are a medical false flag.
[02:11:33.905 --> 02:11:43.288]  They create the condition that sells more vaccines, that causes more of the condition that the CDC uses to declare a state of emergency to sell more vaccines.
[02:11:44.133 --> 02:11:44.213]  It's
[02:12:00.934 --> 02:12:01.475]  Thank you very much.
[02:12:20.953 --> 02:12:25.799]  Well, that's what they're doing to Mark Baker, the guest we had in the first hour from bakersgreenacres.com.
[02:12:25.959 --> 02:12:29.844]  Yeah, they're trying to put him out of business with an economic embargo by the USDA.
[02:12:30.264 --> 02:12:32.707]  Let's go to another caller, Bill in California.
[02:12:32.787 --> 02:12:34.008]  Thanks for calling, Bill.
[02:12:34.028 --> 02:12:35.570]  You're on the air with John Rapoport.
[02:12:36.291 --> 02:12:37.172]  Well, thank you.
[02:12:38.133 --> 02:12:41.017]  My question for all of your viewers is,
[02:12:42.094 --> 02:12:47.019]  How do the constitutional patriots identify each other?
[02:12:47.799 --> 02:12:51.943]  After all, not all... There's a secret handshake.
[02:12:51.983 --> 02:12:52.264]  Yeah.
[02:12:52.484 --> 02:12:56.528]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:12:56.648 --> 02:13:02.934]  No, not all police, not all soldiers are going to want to be on a gun grabbing
[02:13:03.752 --> 02:13:06.574]  But we need to know how we can identify each other.
[02:13:07.015 --> 02:13:08.716]  Yeah, that's a really good question.
[02:13:09.256 --> 02:13:25.249]  Of course, there's the obvious way, like to wear an InfoWars shirt or something, or a hat, but I think what you mean is, yeah, there they are, InfoWarsStore.com, you can get some good Patriot gear, including the TSA t-shirt, wonderful, good timing for today.
[02:13:26.070 --> 02:13:31.854]  But to answer your question, sir, I don't think there's any covert system that's known.
[02:13:31.894 --> 02:13:32.515]  What do you think, John?
[02:13:33.849 --> 02:13:42.998]  No, unfortunately, I mean, the whole idea of being a patriot to the founding principles of the Republic is that you're out in the open about it.
[02:13:43.319 --> 02:13:43.579]  Yeah.
[02:13:43.619 --> 02:13:45.761]  I mean, that's the whole idea.
[02:13:45.781 --> 02:13:48.984]  You know, the Bill of Rights means you don't have to hide in a closet.
[02:13:49.805 --> 02:13:52.888]  So, you find people.
[02:13:52.928 --> 02:13:53.649]  They find you.
[02:13:53.789 --> 02:13:55.931]  You decide whether you can trust them or not.
[02:13:56.011 --> 02:13:57.533]  You see how much knowledge they have.
[02:13:58.251 --> 02:14:01.994]  Do they really understand what the basic principles of this country are all about?
[02:14:02.675 --> 02:14:07.338]  And do they think they're important enough to live by and defend?
[02:14:08.019 --> 02:14:09.540]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:10.221]  I think you're right.
[02:14:10.241 --> 02:14:13.904]  I think it just comes down to knowing your neighbors, knowing the people in your community.
[02:14:14.024 --> 02:14:21.490]  And like you said, Collar, most police officers and law enforcement and soldiers, they are pro-Constitution.
[02:14:21.550 --> 02:14:27.495]  They took an oath to it, unlike the TSA, which never took any oath to anything, except maybe swearing to their paycheck.
[02:14:28.556 --> 02:14:29.739]  Alright, let's go to another caller.
[02:14:29.819 --> 02:14:31.683]  Nick in New York it looks like.
[02:14:31.883 --> 02:14:35.110]  Nick, you're on the air with John Rappaport and Mike Adams.
[02:14:35.150 --> 02:14:35.530]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:14:36.127 --> 02:14:37.848]  Good afternoon to both you gentlemen.
[02:14:37.928 --> 02:14:39.048]  You as well, thank you.
[02:14:39.588 --> 02:14:42.109]  Yes, quick, quick, two quick things.
[02:14:42.169 --> 02:14:50.912]  First of all, Mike, the gentleman that you had on earlier when you were speaking about the farms, the pigs and all that, my heart goes out to that gentleman.
[02:14:50.992 --> 02:14:52.592]  I know he's probably still listening.
[02:14:52.992 --> 02:15:01.995]  My question is this, how in the world, how in the world or where in what rock are these judges going to hide under if this whole thing implodes?
[02:15:02.675 --> 02:15:11.400]  And one of the main causes of this thing imploding is because these judges are upholding illegal laws, or face color, whatever they want to call it.
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:14.282]  It's all color of law, you know, it's all illegal.
[02:15:14.842 --> 02:15:17.063]  And what rock are they going to hide under?
[02:15:17.103 --> 02:15:23.467]  Because these are the main perpetrators of the whole system falling in the direction.
[02:15:23.487 --> 02:15:24.067]  So, I mean, come on.
[02:15:24.087 --> 02:15:24.607]  Nick, you're right.
[02:15:24.727 --> 02:15:25.068]  You're right.
[02:15:25.128 --> 02:15:30.571]  I can only imagine that right now, people who are true Americans are making lists.
[02:15:31.565 --> 02:15:37.858]  List of traitors and that that list is getting larger by the day and it probably includes
[02:15:39.025 --> 02:15:43.328]  You know, court judges who are openly violating the Constitution.
[02:15:43.388 --> 02:15:44.109]  I think you're right.
[02:15:44.169 --> 02:15:45.410]  I think these lists are being made.
[02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:46.731]  What's going to happen to the lists?
[02:15:46.791 --> 02:15:47.151]  I don't know.
[02:15:47.211 --> 02:15:49.153]  Hopefully it just means those people are voted out of office.
[02:15:50.033 --> 02:15:53.096]  In no way am I, you know, condoning violence against those people.
[02:15:53.676 --> 02:15:58.360]  But at the very minimum, we should distribute these lists and kick these people out of office.
[02:15:58.420 --> 02:15:59.601]  Strip them of their power.
[02:16:00.321 --> 02:16:01.082]  Your comments, John.
[02:16:02.492 --> 02:16:07.804]  Yeah, well they're publishing, aren't they, lists of gun owners and where they live and their addresses and everything?
[02:16:08.465 --> 02:16:11.993]  I mean, to me, a court of law
[02:16:13.206 --> 02:16:16.129]  The origin of the idea was, it's local.
[02:16:16.569 --> 02:16:17.991]  People are there.
[02:16:18.491 --> 02:16:19.572]  The citizens are there.
[02:16:19.893 --> 02:16:20.813]  You see a trial.
[02:16:21.174 --> 02:16:22.135]  You want justice.
[02:16:22.555 --> 02:16:25.818]  The people have presumably some degree of common sense.
[02:16:26.379 --> 02:16:35.828]  And now we have this system which is so remote, so complicated, so insane, that anybody with an agenda who has power can decide a case any way they want to, really.
[02:16:35.987 --> 02:16:40.892]  Well, and the courts were created so that people didn't have to settle things by shooting each other.
[02:16:40.912 --> 02:16:41.913]  Exactly.
[02:16:41.993 --> 02:16:46.077]  But if the courts would become so corrupt... Yeah, exactly.
[02:16:46.298 --> 02:16:50.021]  The courts would become so corrupt... That's how it leads, then, it seems like.
[02:16:50.081 --> 02:16:51.203]  What option is left?
[02:16:51.223 --> 02:16:54.166]  When justice is taken from the people, what option do they have left?
[02:16:54.646 --> 02:16:55.367]  Nullification.
[02:16:56.208 --> 02:16:56.868]  That's one of them.
[02:16:57.609 --> 02:16:59.211]  Any follow-up comments, Nick?
[02:16:59.963 --> 02:17:05.666]  Yeah, just one, just one, one other thing with regard to your, to your other, uh, other, you know, presentation argument.
[02:17:05.686 --> 02:17:14.551]  First of all, I want to say that I'm, um, I completely support everything that you guys do and you know, your arguments and just, you know, it's just, it just makes so much sense.
[02:17:14.611 --> 02:17:24.957]  And, and after being detoxified, you know, detoxified, you know, from all the fluoride, years of fluoride and all that through the, uh, InfoWars program, I can honestly say that my head's on straight.
[02:17:25.337 --> 02:17:26.278]  My question is, um,
[02:17:26.778 --> 02:17:30.880]  With regards to these people, let's say, who you said are a little wild, and I'm trying to understand your argument.
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:45.447]  You said that, you know, it's a violation if they come after people who, you know, have prescription drugs or, you know, for depression, all kinds of stuff, and that yet, you know, they will be able to get guns and stuff like that.
[02:17:45.487 --> 02:17:48.529]  But isn't that the case with this kid who went out and
[02:17:48.929 --> 02:17:49.089]  No, no.
[02:18:05.548 --> 02:18:09.572]  You're exactly right about that point, and I want your comments, John, but let me throw mine in first.
[02:18:10.292 --> 02:18:16.537]  I agree that people who are undergoing psychiatric care should not be allowed to purchase firearms.
[02:18:16.657 --> 02:18:21.741]  But the problem is, and this answers your question, Collar, is how wide are they going to cast that net?
[02:18:21.761 --> 02:18:26.625]  Are they going to say one person who had one bottle of antidepressants at some point ten years ago, they're denied the right?
[02:18:27.026 --> 02:18:32.170]  Or are they going to limit it just to the true psychopaths, devil-worshipping, drug-taking, whatever?
[02:18:32.510 --> 02:18:33.711]  That's who we have to limit it to.
[02:18:34.992 --> 02:18:36.092]  I don't know the right answer.
[02:18:36.112 --> 02:18:36.833]  What are your thoughts, John?
[02:18:38.253 --> 02:18:47.915]  Yeah, it's a tough issue because, look, on the one side you've got psychiatry which wants to, you know, bring millions and millions more people into the system where they can drug them and so on.
[02:18:48.495 --> 02:18:56.378]  And so as that list expands, then they can say, well, all these people can't have guns because that satisfies the gun control agenda at the same time.
[02:18:56.398 --> 02:18:56.718]  Right.
[02:18:57.198 --> 02:19:01.579]  So the ultimate solution from the medical point of view, to me, is
[02:19:02.399 --> 02:19:24.707]  You ban the drugs, you destroy that industry, you expose it completely, and you alert all citizens everywhere to never let their children see a psychiatrist, never let them take one of these psychiatric drugs, never get on one of those lists, and just completely destroy that criminal poisoning industry altogether.
[02:19:24.887 --> 02:19:25.868]  This is the better solution.
[02:19:25.908 --> 02:19:26.609]  Sorry to interrupt you, John.
[02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:27.550]  We're about to go to break.
[02:19:27.610 --> 02:19:29.533]  But yeah, to the caller, you're right, John.
[02:19:30.074 --> 02:19:38.884]  If we gave these children fish oil supplements, or omega-3 fatty acids, or trace minerals, all those things are crucial for healthy mind function.
[02:19:39.465 --> 02:19:43.069]  If we gave them those instead of the drugs, then they wouldn't be psychopaths.
[02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:46.672]  They wouldn't be devil worshippers, probably, because their heads would be on straight.
[02:19:47.053 --> 02:19:48.594]  Nutrition has a role in all of this.
[02:19:48.994 --> 02:19:53.317]  If you don't talk about nutrition, you aren't talking about the real cause of violence in America.
[02:19:53.377 --> 02:19:56.119]  Most people in the prisons have nutritional deficiencies.
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:57.721]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:19:57.821 --> 02:20:08.989]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy?
[02:20:09.309 --> 02:20:11.710]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:20:11.991 --> 02:20:18.354]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[02:20:18.594 --> 02:20:28.659]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:32.762]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[02:20:33.302 --> 02:20:34.902]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:20:35.062 --> 02:20:37.243]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[02:20:57.842 --> 02:21:03.406]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older one gets.
[02:21:03.586 --> 02:21:12.752]  The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.
[02:21:13.172 --> 02:21:20.157]  If the Hunza men can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone in North America to experience a more youthful life as well.
[02:21:20.397 --> 02:21:23.199]  One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it
[02:21:23.639 --> 02:21:25.680]  Is the type and quality of protein consumed.
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.142]  All protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged.
[02:21:29.402 --> 02:21:34.525]  Destroying 50-75% of your ability to utilize the body building amino acids.
[02:21:35.146 --> 02:21:40.409]  One World Way is not heat damaged and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids.
[02:21:40.789 --> 02:21:42.950]  This feat no one else has achieved.

[02:21:56.962 --> 02:21:59.684]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:21:59.925 --> 02:22:03.889]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:22:04.089 --> 02:22:06.111]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:06.331 --> 02:22:11.353]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:22:11.494 --> 02:22:13.254]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:22:13.314 --> 02:22:14.655]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:22:14.855 --> 02:22:16.316]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:22:16.336 --> 02:22:19.437]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:22:19.717 --> 02:22:24.740]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:25.461]  We're good to go.

[02:23:01.031 --> 02:23:05.014]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[02:23:05.374 --> 02:23:07.255]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[02:23:07.535 --> 02:23:18.921]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other tissues behave.
[02:23:19.181 --> 02:23:23.624]  I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I've been conditioned to believe.
[02:23:23.904 --> 02:23:25.465]  I began taking RNA drops
[02:23:25.825 --> 02:23:31.649]  A 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy.

[02:24:12.699 --> 02:24:17.322]  All right, the caller from the last segment brought up a really good point and a good question.
[02:24:17.342 --> 02:24:24.948]  He said, shouldn't we deny people who are on psychiatric meds the right to own the firearms?
[02:24:26.029 --> 02:24:38.518]  And Rappaport and I both agree that we don't want firearms in the hands of medicated psychos, but that the real answer is to just stop medicating our children and put them on nutrition instead of psychiatric drugs.
[02:24:38.998 --> 02:24:40.800]  That's the real answer here.
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:43.460]  Any more thoughts on that, John, before we go to the next call?
[02:24:44.481 --> 02:24:45.941]  Yeah, that's the answer.
[02:24:46.041 --> 02:24:53.762]  The answer is looking at what creates health rather than what destroys the brain.
[02:24:53.802 --> 02:24:55.343]  Do you have a cough today, John?
[02:24:55.363 --> 02:24:56.383]  You got a little cough going on?
[02:24:56.503 --> 02:24:58.143]  I do, indeed.
[02:24:58.243 --> 02:24:58.663]  Oh, man.
[02:24:58.703 --> 02:25:00.224]  Did you forget your vitamin D or something?
[02:25:01.504 --> 02:25:04.224]  Actually, I've been taking it, but I don't know what's going on.
[02:25:04.244 --> 02:25:06.545]  It's something in the air, and I have no idea what it is.
[02:25:07.345 --> 02:25:12.007]  Well, it's probably the superbugs that the CDC is releasing to encourage more vaccinations.
[02:25:12.447 --> 02:25:14.508]  Possibly, or maybe they're spraying today.
[02:25:14.548 --> 02:25:16.189]  I'm not sure, but... Yeah.
[02:25:16.889 --> 02:25:17.430]  I'm okay.
[02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:18.070]  All right, good.
[02:25:18.090 --> 02:25:19.991]  Yeah, I know you're generally healthy.
[02:25:20.011 --> 02:25:21.171]  You'll be back on your feet in no time.
[02:25:21.211 --> 02:25:22.172]  But yeah, good point.
[02:25:22.192 --> 02:25:24.393]  We've got to keep these kids healthy instead of keeping them medicated.
[02:25:24.473 --> 02:25:25.753]  Are you okay to take another call now?
[02:25:26.534 --> 02:25:26.994]  Absolutely.
[02:25:27.174 --> 02:25:28.815]  All right, let's go to Jason in Ohio.
[02:25:28.875 --> 02:25:30.235]  Jason, thank you for your call.
[02:25:30.255 --> 02:25:31.996]  You're on the air on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:32.016 --> 02:25:32.536]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:25:32.556 --> 02:25:34.157]  Hi, John and Mike.
[02:25:34.177 --> 02:25:34.757]  How are you doing today?
[02:25:34.898 --> 02:25:35.258]  Doing good.
[02:25:37.850 --> 02:25:47.473]  Hey, my question is, man, and I kind of had the same question the other guy asked, I mean, kind of relevant to the same deal.
[02:25:47.993 --> 02:25:52.054]  Hey, Jason, your phone is really not working.
[02:25:52.074 --> 02:25:53.355]  I'm sorry, I'm going to have to let you go.
[02:25:53.375 --> 02:25:55.115]  I apologize, but it was breaking up there.
[02:25:55.135 --> 02:25:56.595]  Let's go to Thomas in Texas.
[02:25:56.635 --> 02:25:57.336]  Thomas, you're on the air.
[02:25:57.356 --> 02:25:57.776]  Go ahead.
[02:25:57.796 --> 02:26:00.317]  How you guys doing today?
[02:26:00.497 --> 02:26:01.017]  Hey, doing good.
[02:26:01.037 --> 02:26:01.557]  All right.
[02:26:02.959 --> 02:26:22.997]  I just want to say that I can definitely agree with the genetically modified foods, how it is having an effect on the brain as far as, and the drugs and everything, how it's having an effect on the brain as well, but I think that we're kind of overlooking at the same time
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:32.223]  The evil and the darkness that kind of became over the world as well as like the United States as a whole.
[02:26:32.243 --> 02:26:33.083]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:26:33.143 --> 02:26:38.786]  Yeah, you mean like this demonic influx of energy that seems that a lot of these kids seem to be attached to?
[02:26:38.806 --> 02:26:39.666]  Is that what you're talking about?
[02:26:40.682 --> 02:26:41.862]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:26:42.082 --> 02:26:58.086]  Especially just throughout the years with all the terrorist attacks, and then you relate back to the movies, and it shows, you know, before these incidents happened, boom, it was seen in a movie preview or something, and it's like, bam, it's happening.
[02:26:58.466 --> 02:27:06.368]  I think we got to like, you know, start getting healthier, start cleaning our minds, start just cleaning up things, period, in this country.
[02:27:07.228 --> 02:27:11.670]  Yeah, we need some exorcisms is what we need around the country.
[02:27:11.770 --> 02:27:12.390]  Go ahead, John.
[02:27:13.071 --> 02:27:13.891]  Good question, Colin.
[02:27:13.911 --> 02:27:14.351]  Good question.
[02:27:14.371 --> 02:27:14.851]  Go ahead, John.
[02:27:14.911 --> 02:27:15.712]  What are your thoughts on it?
[02:27:17.052 --> 02:27:18.413]  I see this all the time when I...
[02:27:19.597 --> 02:27:22.878]  Forced myself to go to the movies, which is less and less.
[02:27:22.958 --> 02:27:48.287]  But, you know, these films, for example, that are all about disasters, dystopian futures, horrible things going on, it used to be that when you saw movies where there were superheroes and so forth, the general impression was the good guy won, it was very kind of uplifting in a certain kind of way, and then gradually we saw this whole thing darken, where it doesn't really matter anymore in these movies who wins.
[02:27:49.153 --> 02:27:56.924]  Because the whole overall mood is evil, dark, gloom, disaster, diabolical forces at work.
[02:27:57.104 --> 02:27:57.805]  Oh, and it's cool!
[02:27:58.065 --> 02:27:58.986]  It's cool, right?
[02:27:59.026 --> 02:28:04.974]  The kids are taught that worshipping the devil is cool, or being an agent of darkness is hip, or whatever.
[02:28:05.723 --> 02:28:06.224]  Exactly.
[02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:09.347]  It's pretty sick.
[02:28:10.007 --> 02:28:19.076]  It's another way, along with the video games, of programming these kids' minds to accept the general darkness over everything and then to proceed from there.
[02:28:19.116 --> 02:28:20.077]  Well, what's going to happen?
[02:28:20.577 --> 02:28:21.779]  Nothing good, I'll tell you what.
[02:28:22.643 --> 02:28:25.985]  I think the caller is hinting at this combination.
[02:28:26.065 --> 02:28:36.031]  You take someone who's a devil worshipper, like Adam Lanza reportedly was, you put him on psychiatric drugs, you put him on violent video games, slashers and so on.
[02:28:36.351 --> 02:28:38.253]  This combination creates a monster.
[02:28:39.293 --> 02:28:42.097]  And then they go steal someone's gun and use it to kill children.
[02:28:42.137 --> 02:28:45.461]  But the gun is not the origin of the problem.
[02:28:45.541 --> 02:28:50.728]  The origin is all these other things that haven't been addressed and that they refuse to talk about.
[02:28:51.148 --> 02:28:52.510]  John, I gotta let you go.
[02:28:52.530 --> 02:28:54.272]  We gotta go to break, but it's been fun chatting with you today.
[02:28:54.993 --> 02:28:55.534]  Always, Mike.
[02:28:55.574 --> 02:28:56.194]  Thanks so much.
[02:28:56.534 --> 02:28:59.157]  Alright, thanks for joining us, and heal up there.
[02:28:59.197 --> 02:29:01.999]  I know you'll get better for the next show.
[02:29:02.019 --> 02:29:05.722]  You've got your own superfood recipes as well.
[02:29:05.762 --> 02:29:06.162]  No problem.
[02:29:06.382 --> 02:29:07.103]  Thanks for joining us.

[02:29:10.526 --> 02:29:12.007]  Also, I'm just about out of here.
[02:29:12.948 --> 02:29:17.692]  This show continues, but Aaron Dykes will be taking over the broadcast chair here in the next segment.
[02:29:18.152 --> 02:29:19.633]  My name is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.

[02:29:27.559 --> 02:29:37.146]  The show continues with Aaron Dykes with quotes from patriots throughout history talking about the origins of the Second Amendment and our sacred divine right of self-defense.
[02:29:37.546 --> 02:29:38.507]  So stay tuned for that.
[02:29:38.547 --> 02:29:42.270]  That's coming up right after this break as the Alex Jones Show continues.

[02:32:00.555 --> 02:32:05.378]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:32:05.578 --> 02:32:12.744]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[02:32:55.247 --> 02:32:56.327]  InfoWarshop.com
[02:32:59.941 --> 02:33:01.445]  We are on the march.
[02:33:01.806 --> 02:33:04.212]  The empire is on the run.
[02:33:04.974 --> 02:33:08.683]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:21.716 --> 02:33:24.878]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:25.018 --> 02:33:25.719]  I'm Aaron Dykes.
[02:33:25.779 --> 02:33:26.619]  I'm sitting in.
[02:33:26.819 --> 02:33:37.726]  Alex is, of course, on his way, possibly already arriving in New York to appear on Piers Morgan tonight on the CNN program, obviously to discuss the Second Amendment.
[02:33:37.746 --> 02:33:40.068]  If you want to tune into that, it's going to be 8 p.m.
[02:33:40.168 --> 02:33:40.568]  Central.
[02:33:41.288 --> 02:33:41.709]  9 p.m.
[02:33:41.849 --> 02:33:42.629]  Eastern Time.
[02:33:42.730 --> 02:33:44.231]  Other time zones, you figure it out.
[02:33:44.631 --> 02:33:46.933]  But that should definitely be interesting.
[02:33:47.293 --> 02:33:51.436]  Now something I want to talk about today is what is the Second Amendment?
[02:33:51.516 --> 02:33:54.779]  I realize I'm preaching to the choir regarding most of our audience.
[02:33:54.919 --> 02:33:57.461]  Many of them probably know a lot more about it than I do.
[02:33:57.922 --> 02:33:59.142]  But I know this much.
[02:33:59.563 --> 02:34:01.084]  You can't repeal the Second Amendment.
[02:34:01.344 --> 02:34:03.865]  You can't infringe on it through legislation.
[02:34:03.965 --> 02:34:06.926]  Congress, the President, can't just decide to suspend it.
[02:34:07.307 --> 02:34:09.127]  And there are many fold reasons for that.
[02:34:09.147 --> 02:34:13.409]  They are philosophical and they are grounded in history and common sense.
[02:34:13.689 --> 02:34:17.271]  And I just want to talk about some of that because that is a God-given right.
[02:34:17.711 --> 02:34:18.871]  What is a God-given right?
[02:34:18.931 --> 02:34:25.354]  It means that man cannot be the arbiter of whether or not you have a right on any given day under any given climate.
[02:34:25.694 --> 02:34:27.615]  Now here's from the 10th Amendment Center.
[02:34:28.055 --> 02:34:31.579]  Repeal of the Second Amendment would not abolish any right.
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:38.507]  And they bring up, of course, the many so-called news articles and letters to the editor that are calling for a repeal of the Second Amendment.
[02:34:38.847 --> 02:34:40.009]  You've seen many of them.
[02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:48.759]  These individuals believe that a right to own a firearm is based upon the Second Amendment, and the right will magically vanish if the amendment can be repealed.
[02:34:49.279 --> 02:34:52.062]  Of course, the Bill of Rights came up after the Constitution.
[02:34:52.122 --> 02:34:58.127]  They were proposed starting in 1787 and added by demand, then ratified by the states by 1791.
[02:34:59.768 --> 02:35:00.649]  By demand.
[02:35:00.749 --> 02:35:12.940]  Many of the states, many of the founding fathers would not approve the Constitution, would not ratify it, would not sign off on it until the Bill of Rights were added to guarantee our individual rights, to guarantee the rights of the state.
[02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:14.962]  They are of the utmost importance.
[02:35:15.362 --> 02:35:18.465]  And if you infringe on the Second Amendment, you're infringing on all of them.
[02:35:18.906 --> 02:35:21.108]  No one is going to stand for this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:21.448 --> 02:35:24.311]  And the people in power know it, but we just want to put them on notice.
[02:35:24.751 --> 02:35:26.873]  Now, they bring up this very important point.
[02:35:26.973 --> 02:35:33.340]  The modern editions of the Bill of Rights typically don't contain, oh, the very important preamble.
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:40.364]  The paragraph preceding the listing of the first ten Bill of Rights, and there's generally a pretty good reason for that.
[02:35:40.384 --> 02:35:48.330]  I'm going to read that to you right now, again, from the preamble to the Bill of Rights, which itself is an addition to the Constitution.
[02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:57.236]  The first paragraph to that preamble, after announcing how it's from the Congress of the United States, begun and held in the city of New York on Wednesday, the 4th of March, 1789, reads,
[02:36:01.178 --> 02:36:25.315]  The conventions of a number of the states having at the time of their adopting the Constitution expressed a desire in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added as and as extending the ground of public confidence in the government will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution.
[02:36:25.715 --> 02:36:29.938]  This, ladies and gentlemen, points out that the Bill of Rights was specifically added
[02:36:30.558 --> 02:36:42.564]  To acquiesce the demands of founding fathers who didn't want to see their new government destroyed by people greedy for power, people who would use loopholes in the Constitution to concentrate and exploit the populations.
[02:36:42.984 --> 02:36:48.627]  In other words, among the other rights listed in the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment shall not be infringed.
[02:36:48.967 --> 02:36:49.868]  Well, one good reason
[02:36:50.248 --> 02:36:53.570]  Why is that armed citizens make good government?
[02:36:53.890 --> 02:37:00.293]  Now, I'm going to read a number of quotes that refute these terrible ideas we've seen in the press from all kinds of hacks.
[02:37:00.733 --> 02:37:07.656]  One of the most extreme was in Vanity Fair last week from Kurt Eichenwall, whose headline was, let's repeal the Second Amendment.
[02:37:08.016 --> 02:37:15.200]  He wants to replace it with this clause, the people retain the right to keep and bear arms subject to reasonable restrictions.
[02:37:15.580 --> 02:37:15.880]  I think?
[02:37:30.820 --> 02:37:32.982]  The people retain the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:37:33.042 --> 02:37:34.082]  Sounds good so far.
[02:37:34.543 --> 02:37:42.608]  But, subject to reasonable restrictions deemed necessary by the Congress and the President to secure the lives and well-being of others.
[02:37:43.028 --> 02:37:45.510]  Reasonable restrictions means that
[02:37:46.050 --> 02:37:58.879]  The idea is you have no right at all, but the fact is, even if you did outright repeal the Second Amendment and replace it with legalese lawyer language, you still can't legally suspend the Second Amendment because it's a God-given right.
[02:37:59.199 --> 02:38:09.826]  They talked as far back as Dante's Inferno that even, you know, if you don't agree that there is a God or who is God or what God would want, in absentia, in absence, you should still
[02:38:11.351 --> 02:38:11.652]  Throws
[02:38:26.832 --> 02:38:29.354]  Now, the Founding Fathers never agreed on much of anything.
[02:38:29.414 --> 02:38:44.791]  There were different factions who fought vehemently over how centralized their government should be, how much power should remain with the states, all kinds of other clauses, you know, to what degree should we let bankers have power, what should the currency be, but I have yet to find any Founding Father.
[02:38:44.811 --> 02:38:45.952]  I'd love to get emails on it.
[02:38:46.192 --> 02:38:53.900]  Any founding father at all, no matter how reprehensible they are individually, who is against the right to keep and bear arms, they all seem to have backed it.
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:59.986]  Now here is Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, who upheld very early on the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:39:00.106 --> 02:39:06.253]  Quote, the right of citizens to keep and bear arms has been justly considered as the palladium of the liberties of the Republic.
[02:39:06.693 --> 02:39:12.255]  Since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of the rulers.
[02:39:12.555 --> 02:39:18.597]  It will generally, even if they are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.
[02:39:18.737 --> 02:39:21.518]  It's to restrict the arbitrary power of the rulers.
[02:39:21.938 --> 02:39:22.698]  Never forget that.
[02:39:23.098 --> 02:39:28.220]  George Washington said firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself.
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:33.406]  They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence.
[02:39:33.907 --> 02:39:39.034]  Now let's juxtapose these with just a few quotes from the modern 20th century dictators.
[02:39:39.514 --> 02:39:44.100]  Joseph Stalin said, one death is a tragedy, one million is a statistic.
[02:39:44.901 --> 02:39:50.227]  An anonymous American adage reads, if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.
[02:39:50.868 --> 02:40:01.160]  Samuel Adams said the Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:02.842]  Shall not be construed.
[02:40:02.942 --> 02:40:03.963]  Shall not infringe.
[02:40:05.009 --> 02:40:06.431]  Now this is a key quote right here.
[02:40:06.511 --> 02:40:11.456]  Tenshcox, he's not that well known of a founding father, but he was a Federalist from Pennsylvania.
[02:40:11.816 --> 02:40:14.819]  In 1788 he said, who are the militia?
[02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:16.621]  Are they not ourselves?
[02:40:17.142 --> 02:40:21.726]  Is it feared then that we shall turn over our arms, each man against his own bosom?
[02:40:23.408 --> 02:40:26.071]  Congress have no power to disarm the militia.
[02:40:26.491 --> 02:40:31.275]  Their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier are the birthright of an American.
[02:40:31.556 --> 02:40:36.220]  Now there's all this legalese debate over the Second Amendment and the wording having to do with the militia.
[02:40:36.580 --> 02:40:37.541]  Who are the militia?
[02:40:37.901 --> 02:40:41.064]  Again, from this founding father, Tench Cox, who are the militia?
[02:40:41.545 --> 02:40:42.946]  Are they not ourselves?
[02:40:43.046 --> 02:40:43.807]  They certainly are.
[02:40:44.207 --> 02:40:56.176]  Now, James Madison said the Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed, which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, where the governments are afraid to trust their people with arms.
[02:40:57.377 --> 02:41:01.760]  Joseph Stalin, on the other hand, said ideas are more powerful than guns.
[02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:03.941]  We would not let our enemies have guns.
[02:41:04.041 --> 02:41:05.843]  Why should we let them have ideas?
[02:41:07.295 --> 02:41:15.718]  As Big New Brzezinski said quite recently, in earlier times it was easier to control 1 million people than to physically kill 1 million people.
[02:41:16.138 --> 02:41:20.740]  Today it's infinitely easier to kill 1 million people than to control them.
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:30.763]  And of course, through democide, government-sanctioned murder, government is the number one non-natural cause of death throughout history, particularly in the 20th century.
[02:41:31.143 --> 02:41:35.425]  Joseph Stalin said, death solves all problems, no man, no problem.
[02:41:35.825 --> 02:41:39.227]  He also said the only real power comes out of a long rifle.
[02:41:39.908 --> 02:41:47.112]  Alexander Hamilton, who I'm critical of for his banking stances, even upholds the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment.
[02:41:47.172 --> 02:41:52.055]  The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
[02:41:53.049 --> 02:41:55.251]  Then you've got things like the Nazi law from 1938.
[02:41:55.491 --> 02:42:00.815]  Those now possessing weapons and ammunition are at once to turn them over to the local police authority.
[02:42:00.875 --> 02:42:06.219]  Firearms and ammunition found in a Jew's possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation.
[02:42:06.579 --> 02:42:12.264]  Whoever willfully or negligently violates the provisions will be punished with imprisonment and a fine.
[02:42:12.604 --> 02:42:14.786]  We know where things went in Nazi Germany, of course.
[02:42:15.206 --> 02:42:22.553]  Thomas Paine, arms discourage and keep the invader and plunder and all and preserve order in the world as well as property.
[02:42:22.653 --> 02:42:26.557]  Horrible mischief would ensue were law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
[02:42:26.978 --> 02:42:30.721]  It is the duty of the Patriot to protect his country from its government.
[02:42:31.142 --> 02:42:37.288]  Thomas Paine also said, and Thomas Jefferson said quite famously, when governments fear the people there's liberty.
[02:42:37.768 --> 02:42:39.710]  When the people fear the government, there's tyranny.
[02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:48.399]  The strongest reason for the people to retain their right and keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government.
[02:42:48.499 --> 02:42:51.402]  Again, it has nothing to do about hunting, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:51.422 --> 02:42:57.829]  I'm just trying to point out how together the Founding Fathers were on the right of the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms.
[02:42:58.189 --> 02:43:09.380]  Benjamin Franklin sort of foretold this common era of communism where one of the big slogans, whether it's Mao or Stalin, is turn your sword into a plowshare and basically be a slave to the government.
[02:43:09.740 --> 02:43:15.285]  Ben Franklin said those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn't.
[02:43:15.706 --> 02:43:18.889]  Those who didn't turn in their swords, their arms, their guns, whatever.
[02:43:20.595 --> 02:43:25.058]  To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
[02:43:25.438 --> 02:43:32.483]  That's the founding father, George Mason, one of the individuals most responsible for getting the Bill of Rights instituted in the first place.
[02:43:32.943 --> 02:43:41.068]  Compare to disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them with what Joseph Stalin said, if the opposition disarms, well and good.
[02:43:41.629 --> 02:43:44.671]  If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves.
[02:43:46.297 --> 02:43:52.922]  What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance?
[02:43:53.382 --> 02:43:54.423]  Let them take arms.
[02:43:54.523 --> 02:43:55.424]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:43:55.784 --> 02:43:58.446]  A free people ought not to be armed and disciplined.
[02:43:59.027 --> 02:44:04.791]  Not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence.
[02:44:05.211 --> 02:44:05.972]  We're good to go.
[02:44:21.525 --> 02:44:24.168]  Guard with jealous attention the public liberty.
[02:44:24.609 --> 02:44:24.969]  Guard it.
[02:44:25.329 --> 02:44:27.892]  Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel.
[02:44:28.293 --> 02:44:31.256]  Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force.
[02:44:31.657 --> 02:44:33.719]  Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined.
[02:44:34.079 --> 02:44:36.542]  The great object is that every man be armed.
[02:44:36.742 --> 02:44:38.504]  Everyone who is able might have a gun.
[02:44:39.105 --> 02:44:45.730]  Are we at last brought to such a humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense?
[02:44:46.130 --> 02:44:47.351]  That's also Patrick Henry.
[02:44:47.671 --> 02:44:49.493]  And here's another Alexander Hamilton.
[02:44:49.833 --> 02:45:00.661]  If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, then there is no recourse left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense, which is paramount to all positive forms of government.
[02:45:01.041 --> 02:45:03.002]  That's Alexander Hamilton and The Federalist, number 28.
[02:45:04.537 --> 02:45:18.190]  The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, or on any pretense, raised in America.
[02:45:18.210 --> 02:45:19.892]  That's Noah Webster in 1888. 1787.
[02:45:23.115 --> 02:45:23.956]  I'm sorry, 1787.
[02:45:24.576 --> 02:45:30.821]  And the whole point is they want to disarm us because they want to institute unconstitutional, arbitrary rule.
[02:45:30.881 --> 02:45:38.868]  They want dictatorships, whether it comes in an overt form that looks like Joseph Stalin or a friendly form where they continue to rotate presidents.
[02:45:39.248 --> 02:45:46.554]  Thomas Jefferson said a free people claim their right is derived from the laws of nature and not as a gift of their chief magistrate.
[02:45:48.330 --> 02:45:51.973]  1774.
[02:45:48.571 --> 02:45:51.973]  The balance of power is the scale of peace.
[02:45:52.054 --> 02:45:57.078]  The same balance would be preserved where all the world destitute of arms, for all would be alike.
[02:45:57.478 --> 02:46:00.641]  But since some will not, others dare not lay them aside.
[02:46:01.021 --> 02:46:05.284]  And while a single nation refuses to lay them down, it's proper that all should keep them up.
[02:46:05.725 --> 02:46:09.428]  Horrid mischief would ensue where one half of the world deprived of the use of them.
[02:46:09.868 --> 02:46:10.509]  Thomas Paine, 1775.
[02:46:12.250 --> 02:46:15.072]  Mao Zedong, 1938, Chairman Mao.
[02:46:15.433 --> 02:46:18.415]  Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
[02:46:18.755 --> 02:46:23.439]  He said the people must understand this for the revolution, the great revolution of China to take place.
[02:46:23.959 --> 02:46:33.607]  To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.
[02:46:34.027 --> 02:46:34.888]  Richard Henry Lee, 1778.
[02:46:36.329 --> 02:46:41.175]  The right of citizens to bear arms is just one more guarantee against arbitrary government.
[02:46:41.755 --> 02:46:49.424]  One more safeguard against the tyranny which now appears remote in America, but which historically has proved to be always possible.
[02:46:49.845 --> 02:46:51.847]  That's from 1960, Hubert Humphrey.
[02:46:52.227 --> 02:46:54.590]  A little bit unexpected, but nonetheless right on the money.
[02:46:56.312 --> 02:47:05.695]  Adolf Hitler of course said, or is quoted to have said in 1942, the most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms.
[02:47:06.155 --> 02:47:12.557]  History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by doing so.
[02:47:12.977 --> 02:47:15.158]  Why would a dictator not want an armed population?
[02:47:15.218 --> 02:47:16.899]  So he can run roughshod over them.
[02:47:17.219 --> 02:47:18.359]  So he can try to rule them.
[02:47:18.899 --> 02:47:19.480]  Orrin Hatch,
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:23.763]  Still in the Senate, or maybe just possibly just retired.
[02:47:24.123 --> 02:47:34.432]  If gun laws in fact work, the sponsors of this type of legislation should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of crime rates reduced by such legislation.
[02:47:34.853 --> 02:47:37.855]  That they cannot do so after a century and a half of trying.
[02:47:38.176 --> 02:47:42.099]  That they must sweep under the rug the Southern attempts at gun control in the 1870 to 1910 period.
[02:47:44.361 --> 02:47:59.427]  The Northeastern attempts of the 1920 to 1939 period, the attempts at both federal and state levels through 1965 and 1976, establishes the repeated, complete, and inevitable failure of gun laws to control serious crimes.
[02:47:59.747 --> 02:48:04.448]  And again, the Columbine school shootings happened during the assault weapons ban under Clinton.
[02:48:04.869 --> 02:48:13.192]  All these school shootings have taken a rise ever since they signed the gun-free school zones, and ever since all these people have been on medications, SSRIs.
[02:48:14.272 --> 02:48:21.894]  William Burroughs, in 1991, the author said, after a shooting spree, they always want to take the guns away from people who didn't do it.
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:28.463]  I sure as hell wouldn't want to live in a society where the only people allowed guns are the police and military.
[02:48:29.023 --> 02:48:35.206]  George Washington said the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere restrains evil interference.
[02:48:35.226 --> 02:48:38.148]  They deserve a place of honor with all that's good.
[02:48:38.228 --> 02:48:44.771]  And the Second Amendment itself, of course, reads a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[02:48:45.271 --> 02:48:49.232]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:48:49.272 --> 02:48:51.093]  Now the choice is clear here, folks.
[02:48:51.513 --> 02:48:52.854]  It's freedom or tyranny.
[02:48:53.214 --> 02:48:54.974]  Disarmament is tyranny.
[02:48:55.134 --> 02:48:56.895]  It's a recipe for enslavement.
[02:48:57.215 --> 02:49:01.177]  If we want to uphold the rest of our freedoms, we have to stand by the Second Amendment.
[02:49:01.277 --> 02:49:11.500]  Even if you individually, personally don't like guns, aren't comfortable around them, you should get guns and train them and learn how to use them safely so that bad things don't happen.
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:13.901]  And so there's a buffer against intruders.
[02:49:14.301 --> 02:49:14.782]  I don't know.
[02:49:31.603 --> 02:49:31.723]  Yes.
[02:49:48.317 --> 02:50:05.123]  If nothing else, since the assassination of JFK, it's really been going on since the time that Harry Truman seceded FDR after he took broad executive power and claimed that the buck stopped with him, the president, even though a shadow government was emerging under the 1947 National Security Act.
[02:50:07.004 --> 02:50:09.325]  And we've been in dire straits ever since.
[02:50:09.485 --> 02:50:10.945]  Do not give up your arms people.
[02:50:11.305 --> 02:50:14.826]  Government democide and disarmament are the greatest threats of violence.
[02:50:15.207 --> 02:50:18.228]  That is a study academically at the University of Hawaii.
[02:50:18.748 --> 02:50:23.169]  We've communicated with RJ Rummel and we're looking to get an interview with him in the future.
[02:50:23.189 --> 02:50:27.110]  He's the one who's compiled statistics on more than 262 million deaths at the
[02:50:29.731 --> 02:50:32.433]  at the hands of government just in the 20th century alone.
[02:50:32.833 --> 02:50:38.937]  Mike Adams has wrote about it, our writers at InfoWars have wrote about it, and it's something we better pay close attention to.
[02:50:38.957 --> 02:50:46.242]  We'll be back after this with a few more thoughts, but just remember folks, the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, is a guarantee.
[02:50:46.302 --> 02:50:47.443]  It's a God-given right.
[02:50:47.503 --> 02:50:50.265]  It can't be given by men or taken away legitimately.
[02:50:50.625 --> 02:50:53.347]  InfoWars.com, tune in to Piers Morgan tonight.
[02:50:53.467 --> 02:50:57.110]  Alex is going to take him on and explain what the Second Amendment's really all about.
[02:50:57.130 --> 02:50:57.710]  Stay tuned
[02:50:57.910 --> 02:51:01.773]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[02:51:01.894 --> 02:51:09.100]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[02:51:09.400 --> 02:51:11.802]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:51:12.102 --> 02:51:18.448]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[02:51:18.708 --> 02:51:19.829]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[02:51:20.109 --> 02:51:28.737]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[02:51:29.138 --> 02:51:32.901]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[02:51:33.101 --> 02:51:34.963]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.
[02:51:35.163 --> 02:51:37.325]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[02:51:57.586 --> 02:51:57.986]  Hi there.
[02:51:58.587 --> 02:51:59.647]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:00.108 --> 02:52:03.330]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:52:03.950 --> 02:52:12.756]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:52:13.116 --> 02:52:19.120]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:52:19.801 --> 02:52:21.382]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:52:21.982 --> 02:52:27.066]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:52:27.826 --> 02:52:34.909]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:52:35.769 --> 02:52:40.691]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.

[02:52:53.636 --> 02:52:54.816]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:52:57.239 --> 02:53:01.343]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:02.004 --> 02:53:04.146]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:05.047 --> 02:53:13.375]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:14.016 --> 02:53:18.921]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:19.557 --> 02:53:30.528]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:30.929 --> 02:53:37.936]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:38.596 --> 02:53:42.882]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:42.902 --> 02:53:46.086]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:46.507 --> 02:53:53.456]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:53:53.777 --> 02:53:54.758]  Protect your immune system.
[02:53:55.038 --> 02:53:56.080]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:14.212 --> 02:54:18.796]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Second Amendment is in place to restrict tyranny.
[02:54:18.836 --> 02:54:20.457]  It's not about offensive action.
[02:54:20.477 --> 02:54:23.540]  It's not about enabling murders to kill more people.
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:29.105]  It's about the tendency of mankind, individually and as groups, to be corrupt.
[02:54:29.525 --> 02:54:35.951]  It's a tendency for mankind to want power, to want to hold on to power, and then to crave more power because
[02:54:36.551 --> 02:54:38.812]  Something inherent in us is wicked.
[02:54:38.852 --> 02:54:40.612]  There's of course a lot of good as well.
[02:54:40.732 --> 02:54:54.197]  And the whole point that our Founding Fathers saw, many of them were corrupt individuals themselves, many of them were very good and brilliant people, was to balance that power because anyone given too much power will become corrupt.
[02:54:54.237 --> 02:55:01.679]  There's that old adage, I forget the name of the guy off the top of my head, but power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:55:02.219 --> 02:55:04.761]  And absolutely that's a theme throughout history.
[02:55:05.122 --> 02:55:10.586]  That's why the Obama administration wants to see the assault rifle ban renewed.
[02:55:10.626 --> 02:55:12.248]  But even that's not good enough for them.
[02:55:12.288 --> 02:55:18.493]  So they want thumbprinting and registration and closing the gun holes, gun show loopholes.
[02:55:18.513 --> 02:55:19.634]  But that's not enough either.
[02:55:19.734 --> 02:55:20.775]  So they're going to take
[02:55:21.115 --> 02:55:21.275]  It's
[02:55:38.851 --> 02:55:39.191]  That's
[02:55:58.940 --> 02:56:10.225]  During that season or that moment in time, but to the Constitution and Bill of Rights upholding and trining our individual rights and trying to maintain a balance of power so that nobody gets too much.
[02:56:10.665 --> 02:56:21.830]  Now, the entire American Revolution was based on many things, of course, but it was sparked specifically by an attempt at disarmament at Lexington and Concord on April 19th, 1775.
[02:56:21.990 --> 02:56:24.171]  That's over a year before July 4th, by the way.
[02:56:26.952 --> 02:56:44.889]  And I think really that's probably why they chose April 19th as a famous, as a favorite false flag date for Waco, for Oklahoma City, to kind of send the message that maybe patriots, armed patriots are somehow the enemy in this country, but then there's that little wink of the eye, that underlying message that government
[02:56:45.169 --> 02:56:45.529]  That's right.
[02:57:06.155 --> 02:57:12.157]  ...has been collected at Concord for a valid purpose of raising and supporting a rebellion against His Majesty.
[02:57:12.517 --> 02:57:16.418]  You will march with me to the Corps of Grenadiers and Light Infantry.
[02:57:16.818 --> 02:57:30.222]  Put under your command, with the utmost expedition and secrecy, to Concord, where you will seize and destroy all artillery, ammunition, provisions, tents, small arms, and all military stores, whatever.
[02:57:30.663 --> 02:57:35.084]  But you will take care that the soldiers do not plunder the inhabitants or hurt private property.
[02:57:35.544 --> 02:57:41.707]  You have a draft of Concord on which is marked the houses, barns, etc., which contain the above military stores.
[02:57:42.107 --> 02:57:49.930]  You will order of Trunian to be knocked off each gun, but if it is found impractical on any, they must be spiked and the carriages destroyed.
[02:57:49.950 --> 02:57:57.593]  The powder and flour must be shook out of all the barrels into the river, the tents burnt, the pork and beef destroyed in the best way you can devise.
[02:57:57.974 --> 02:58:02.896]  And the men may put balls of lead into their pockets, throwing them by degrees into ponds, ditches, etc.
[02:58:03.596 --> 02:58:07.377]  But no quantity, together, so that they may be recovered afterwards.
[02:58:07.417 --> 02:58:17.959]  If you meet any brass artillery, and it goes on from there, that letter, that action of disarmament sparked the American Revolution, because you should not try to disarm the militia.
[02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:22.280]  They are legitimate people armed to restrict an overreach of power.
[02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:25.861]  There are many other abuses, of course, and we must keep that in mind.
[02:58:25.921 --> 02:58:28.462]  Tyrannical government is not welcome in the United States.
[02:58:28.502 --> 02:58:29.442]  Let's never give in.
[02:58:29.722 --> 02:58:30.963]  Let's defend the Second Amendment.
[02:58:31.083 --> 02:58:32.903]  Alex Jones, CNN, Piers Morgan,
[02:58:33.203 --> 02:58:34.243]  Tonight, 8 p.m.
[02:58:34.283 --> 02:58:34.703]  Central.
[02:58:34.723 --> 02:58:36.744]  Nightly News Tonight will cover the TSA.
