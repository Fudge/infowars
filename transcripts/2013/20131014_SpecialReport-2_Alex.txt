[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:01.150]  I'm Gigi Ornette.
[00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.231]  Welcome to Tyranny Watch.
[00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:04.573]  So what happened to the freedom to worship?
[00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:09.178]  Catholics across the United States are a target for the militant government.
[00:00:10.018 --> 00:00:18.466]  They cannot worship at military bases and priests who offer to do the masses even for free are being told that they may be arrested for it.
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.520]  Clearly, the people of Washington D.C.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.081]  need to examine their hearts.
[00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:32.683]  The deceit reaches over oceans as Kerry is in Malaysia and he praises Malaysia for their multi-faith model in a Muslim country that bans Bibles.
[00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:43.645]  It's good to know that Secretary of State John Kerry's ideal multi-faith model is a country that seized 20,000 Christian Bibles, banned Ahmadis from praying, and destroys a Hindu temple every three weeks.
[00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:48.267]  Let's hope his boss doesn't intend to introduce this multi-faith model in the United States.
[00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:53.509]  One of the worst problems is forced conversions to Islam, which has become particularly acute since 2001.
[00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.752]  Despite the provision for freedom of religion entrenched in Article 11 in the Malaysian Constitution,
[00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:03.414]  Even the non-recognized Muslim sects are in trouble.
[00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:15.660]  The Selangor Council of Islamic Religion in Malaysia has issued a notice ordering the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Malaysia to immediately stop offering prayer services at the national AMC headquarters.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.542]  The waters are definitely muddy when it comes to multi-faith in this administration.
[00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:25.365]  This weekend they had their hands full as people stood up all over Washington.
[00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:41.137]  Thank you for being here today because we, the people, are determined to show the United States military, our esteemed vets, that the size of the heart of America for our vets is immeasurable.
[00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:43.918]  We are here to honor our vets.
[00:01:44.478 --> 00:01:50.599]  You look around, though, and you see these barricades, and you have to ask yourself,
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.629]  That a commander-in-chief would show his respect, his gratitude to our military.
[00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.130]  This belongs to you.
[00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:05.493]  This does not belong to the government.
[00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:06.915]  It belongs to the people.
[00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.310]  No, no.
[00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:37.968]  There always has to be a bully cop or a bully government official.
[00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:44.754]  And in New York, a criminal defense attorney reveals that in the Bronx, they actually lied to meet quotas.
[00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:48.136]  Narcotic police lied to reach arrest quotas in the Bronx.
[00:02:48.397 --> 00:02:54.982]  It'll be interesting to hear details in upcoming weeks about how they threw innocent people in the slammer just to satisfy their job requirements.
[00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:59.866]  The TSA absolutely humiliates an 82-year-old woman at Sky Harbor Airport.
[00:03:00.286 --> 00:03:04.729]  This revelation is in a recent report only available because of the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:14.094]  An 82-year-old woman in a wheelchair in the screening line at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport goes all the way through until the metal detector beeps over her chest.
[00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:18.437]  The woman tells TSA that she has a breast prosthesis because she had a mastectomy.
[00:03:18.877 --> 00:03:26.981]  The TSA agents take the woman to a room and order her to take off her blouse, then her bra, and then her prosthesis, which they examine.
[00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:31.284]  The elderly woman strips to her waist with nothing to hide her scars.
[00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:32.664]  Welcome to the USA.
[00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:33.825]  Stop the tyranny.

[00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:46.292]  Remember Psalm 118.8 says that it's better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust humans.
