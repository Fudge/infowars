[00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:10.013]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.013 --> 00:00:11.594]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:13.136]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:17.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.423]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:49.806]  Something really hit me this morning in the throes of my desperation to try to somehow unlock the minds of the general population to discover the fact that there is a war against reality, a war against truth going on.
[00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:54.271]  As I watched a video that is up at Infowars.com
[00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:59.354]  That I do not recommend squeamish people view.
[00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:05.596]  A gruesome video shows Syrian rebel beheading civilian.
[00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:09.218]  And it's Al-Qaeda with the Al-Qaeda announcements.
[00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:13.739]  And I've seen many of these videos where they throw Christians off roofs and blow up the churches.
[00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:21.102]  And to know that the globalists that run our country are commanding and funding these people absolutely upsets me.
[00:01:22.284 --> 00:01:27.148]  And I was thinking to myself, how do I capture the public's attention?
[00:01:27.148 --> 00:01:40.939]  Because the establishment thinks that you're so disconnected from reality, not even so much stupid, but so tuned in to sitcoms and all the garbage, that they can
[00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:56.828]  Blame Iraq for 9-11 with no proof, get caught lying about it, and then say Saudi Arabia, where 15 of the 19 supposed hijackers came from, is completely exempt from all of this and our ally.
[00:01:56.828 --> 00:02:00.610]  I mean, that shows how dumb they think we are.
[00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.374]  And then now they've gone about, let's not exaggerate, a thousand steps further, literally.
[00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:29.771]  I mean, just so far beyond it, that absurdist garbage, to hyper-bizarro world, where the government publicly, for over two and a half, almost three years, runs Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria, funds them to engage in all sorts of horrible activities.
[00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:36.687]  And the media then says we've got to invade Syria because Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:36.687 --> 00:02:44.269]  And just kind of leaves it out there so the public thinks, well, Assad is Al-Qaeda, while Al-Qaeda is attacking him.
[00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:51.232]  And then I see some of the military comments, you know, on the military sites are like, yeah, sure, we have the Arabs killing each other, we play both sides.
[00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:53.052]  You don't play anything.
[00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:57.074]  The New World Order plays all sides, and they run Al-Qaeda to take our liberties.
[00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.120]  And you notice now they're announcing Saudi Arabians don't have to get patted down and all that and go right in the truss of Traveler Line, but your wife?
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.564]  They're going to look for George Washington in her panties.
[00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.666]  Let me tell you, they're not looking for Bin Laden, you know.
[00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:16.113]  In your underwear now, they're looking for George Washington.
[00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:17.553]  They're looking for Thomas Jefferson.
[00:03:17.553 --> 00:03:19.054]  They demonize the Founding Fathers.
[00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:22.295]  They demonize gun owners, Christians, returning veterans.
[00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:24.136]  And where's the debate in the military?
[00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:25.876]  Where's the debate in talk radio?
[00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:27.137]  Where's the debate anywhere?
[00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:29.978]  The CFR brags, we need Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:32.899]  Mohammed Karzai comes out and says the West runs Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:33.579]  It's a fact!
[00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:47.395]  And I want my Constitution back, I want my liberty back, and I call the hoax of a bunch of foreign banks running this country and using their little attack dog, Al-Qaeda, to menace us so we let the government declare us terrorists.
[00:03:47.395 --> 00:03:54.837]  They've already made the flip to saying Al-Qaeda's our buddy and gun owners are the terrorists, and I told you it was coming!
[00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:57.778]  And if you don't call these crooks, it's over.
[00:03:57.778 --> 00:04:00.459]  Going along with these people is going to wreck everything.
[00:04:01.363 --> 00:04:05.147]  And I think, what's a psych warfare operation to run on them?
[00:04:05.147 --> 00:04:08.230]  Using my weapon, the truth.
[00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.935]  And it's up to you whether or not this is going to hurt them coming up in about one hour.
[00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:16.758]  Paul Watson's doing the article right now.
[00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:21.083]  But let me tell you, you drop the hammer on these people with the information we're going to release.
[00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:25.067]  And again, we're just pointing out the absurdity of everything.
[00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:31.599]  Coming up in one hour, Paul Watson's doing the article right now.
[00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:32.880]  High noon, it'll be ready.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.822]  I want to move Palace to 20 after so I can make this announcement on air.
[00:04:36.822 --> 00:04:39.143]  Greg Palace is coming on about the whole Cyprus situation.
[00:04:39.143 --> 00:04:50.170]  We've got John Rappaport about how they're openly drugging the supposed shooter from the Colorado staged Batman thing.
[00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.191]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.212]  They got him on mind control drugs publicly.
[00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.312]  To make him tell the truth.
[00:04:55.312 --> 00:04:56.897]  I mean, it's just, it's beyond.
[00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.724]  They are, total tyranny is taking over.
[00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:05.895]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:09.756]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:12.057]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:17.919]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:24.581]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:30.564]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:34.225]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:39.029]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.975]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:48.538]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:50.500]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.641]  It's here.

[00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:08.475]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:37.201]  It is Thursday, the 21st day of March, 2013.
[00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:40.742]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:40.742 --> 00:08:47.104]  Let's get Greg Pallast on at noon, and then I'll make my big announcement at 1230.
[00:08:47.104 --> 00:08:55.367]  So Greg Pallast is going to be at noon on the whole banking cartel, setting the precedent to take all the money out of your bank account.
[00:08:56.247 --> 00:09:03.190]  whenever they want to, to funnel it into the private world government established at the heart of the European Union.
[00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:22.157]  And then John Rappaport is going to join us in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today to talk about the open MK-Ultra drugging of Mr. Holmes, the patsy in the false flag Fast and Furious Part 2 that was run by the Pentagon, clearly, there in
[00:09:22.677 --> 00:09:23.378]  Colorado.
[00:09:23.378 --> 00:09:25.199]  I mean, I've already gone over this about 500 times.
[00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:35.865]  We'll do it in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today, but he was under DARPA funding in a public mind control program with a top Air Force psychiatrist over him, and they're blocking the release of the toxicology reports.
[00:09:35.865 --> 00:09:37.646]  We know he was on seven drugs.
[00:09:37.646 --> 00:09:38.987]  We know he had handlers.
[00:09:38.987 --> 00:09:41.669]  We know there were other shooters, the witnesses reported.
[00:09:41.669 --> 00:09:43.570]  We know he told people, I've been drugged.
[00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.551]  I don't know who I am.
[00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:47.372]  He's obviously whacked out of his brain.
[00:09:47.372 --> 00:09:49.674]  On and on and on and on and on.
[00:09:50.154 --> 00:09:51.535]  And yes, I've looked at it.
[00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:53.996]  Sandy Hook, Black Op, all the way.
[00:09:53.996 --> 00:09:56.798]  It's open and shut on Aurora.
[00:09:56.798 --> 00:09:58.759]  We're 95% there on Sandy Hook.
[00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:03.862]  They had, you know, cops, we learned, arrested in combat gear, hiding in the woods.
[00:10:03.862 --> 00:10:06.704]  And first they said, oh, no, no, there was no one in the woods.
[00:10:06.704 --> 00:10:07.504]  That's made up.
[00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:10.526]  Children said that when there's chopper video of it.
[00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:11.647]  And we later got the names.
[00:10:12.387 --> 00:10:24.895]  of an anti-terrorism task force, federalized police from three counties over, in the special response teams they have in every city now and county that are under the feds, they were there.
[00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:25.816]  Boom!
[00:10:25.816 --> 00:10:26.616]  Boom!
[00:10:26.616 --> 00:10:40.746]  You had all the rest of it, the timing and all of it, and Bloomberg tweeting within three minutes, and then we now admit he brags they were ready for the next event, and you've got the salivating, the salivating of Michael Moore,
[00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:46.772]  About, oh, if we had Harry Reid's dead grandchildren, we'd be able to overcome the Second Amendment.
[00:10:48.327 --> 00:10:53.651]  I mean, these guys are so arrogant right now, they're publicly flaunting it all in our face.
[00:10:53.651 --> 00:10:55.813]  Let's release the photos of the dead kids.
[00:10:55.813 --> 00:10:58.414]  Let's throw that in everybody's face.
[00:10:58.414 --> 00:11:00.956]  Then I saw a We Are Change video of Lindsey Graham.
[00:11:00.956 --> 00:11:06.540]  We're going to play later the amazing work of We Are Change, the model of citizen journalism out there right now.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:12.885]  Unless you look at Infowars.com, but it's definitely paramount there with what they're doing.
[00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:19.813]  And expanding on all of this, Lindsey Graham's like, we can kill whoever we want.
[00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:20.934]  President can kill whoever he wants.
[00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:22.275]  He can kill citizens.
[00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:23.736]  We're protecting America.
[00:11:23.736 --> 00:11:26.379]  We're not the, he says, we're not the SS.
[00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:26.899]  Really weird.
[00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:27.820]  We're not the SS.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.381]  We're moral.
[00:11:29.381 --> 00:11:32.424]  And he's such an obvious degenerate little scumbag.
[00:11:32.424 --> 00:11:33.565]  You can see right through him.
[00:11:33.565 --> 00:11:35.607]  Just drunk on power, all sweating.
[00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:49.993]  Oh yeah, you're moral, you work for foreign banks that are imploding prosperity and funding the destruction of the family and bioweapon attacks through vaccines, the water of the GMO against everybody.
[00:11:49.993 --> 00:11:52.895]  You're a little front man, a little mercenary pimp.
[00:11:52.895 --> 00:11:55.017]  And you're not even a good one.
[00:11:55.017 --> 00:11:59.560]  Now look at these vessels of evil, they're pathetic!
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.782]  They're willfully turning themselves over to darkness.
[00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.932]  And then I look at the video that's got me so angry today.
[00:12:05.932 --> 00:12:07.073]  Gruesome video.
[00:12:07.073 --> 00:12:08.574]  And let's not show it for TV viewers.
[00:12:08.574 --> 00:12:11.697]  If they choose to go watch it, we're not going to show it.
[00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:15.560]  If people choose to go watch it at Infowars.com, you can.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.362]  And I mean, I see so many of these that the enemy's winning against me.
[00:12:18.362 --> 00:12:28.770]  I get to where I don't even look at new images of dead kids and new images of people having their heads chopped off in the celebrations as Al Qaeda gets Christians and others and throws them off roofs and saws their heads off.
[00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:48.775]  Everything else, and just to know that NATO and the globalists and that NATO is the new world army with the US military at the heart of it, just putting Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria and Afghanistan and Pakistan and using Al Qaeda worldwide to overthrow countries and just wreck nations.
[00:12:50.587 --> 00:12:57.238]  And then use them as the cut-out fake threat, the sock puppet, to then take our liberties and then flip the whole thing.
[00:12:57.238 --> 00:13:01.024]  And I saw this behind the scenes coming for 11 years, now it's public.
[00:13:01.024 --> 00:13:03.007]  And you think I'm happy being right about this?
[00:13:03.007 --> 00:13:05.390]  You think it's fun to get up here because I have to be honorable?
[00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:13.651]  Can I confront these globalists and call them murderers and expose what they're doing and call their house of cards and call their emperors new clothes?
[00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:15.293]  You think that's fun?
[00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:18.435]  I guarantee you my life's in danger right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:18.435 --> 00:13:19.737]  So why am I doing this?
[00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:22.139]  Because there is no future if we don't beat these people.
[00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:23.500]  They are crazy!
[00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:33.334]  They're introducing in the open ocean giant GMO salmon that major university studies show within just a few generations will extinct all ocean salmon.
[00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:34.935]  They're four times bigger.
[00:13:34.935 --> 00:13:39.477]  They've got all sorts of weird plant and insect genes in them.
[00:13:39.477 --> 00:13:40.517]  Okay?
[00:13:40.517 --> 00:13:48.641]  I mean, the globalists say they're taking our rights for the environment to save the Earth, while they act like aliens from another planet hell-bent on destroying the Earth.
[00:13:49.431 --> 00:13:52.532]  I'm not saying they're aliens from another planet, but I've analyzed these people.
[00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:58.575]  These people are turned over to pure evil, and they enjoy wrecking pretty things.
[00:13:58.575 --> 00:14:05.678]  And they love acting like good guys, selling everybody on how wonderful they are.
[00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:12.461]  And again, what we need is people out there that know about the dark side, but who have a good side and who love God.
[00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:14.302]  People that know evil to fight evil.
[00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:19.621]  You see, there's so many people who think evil is powerful who try to become evil.
[00:14:19.621 --> 00:14:22.904]  They go and do evil things to become evil.
[00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:26.849]  But really strong people have a knowledge of good and evil.
[00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:28.030]  That's why we're falling.
[00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:33.356]  But we understand really where it ends and how bad it is and recoil from it at the final step.
[00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:35.939]  We get all the sexiness of it on its surface.
[00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:36.580]  I know evil.
[00:14:37.637 --> 00:14:38.878]  I can swim all through it.
[00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.901]  And let me tell you something, when you stare into the abyss, it doesn't change, you change.
[00:14:42.901 --> 00:14:44.203]  You dance with the devil, you change.
[00:14:44.203 --> 00:14:46.645]  I don't like this, okay?
[00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:51.389]  This is not fun.
[00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:53.370]  Makes me so sick.
[00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.792]  I mean, think of the mind control.
[00:14:55.792 --> 00:14:57.874]  Think of the overthrow of reality.
[00:14:57.874 --> 00:15:04.459]  Think of the war on reality, that they are openly destroying the environment, butchering the genetic code of the planet,
[00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.773]  Killing plants and animals, killing humans, diseasing everything.
[00:15:09.773 --> 00:15:17.499]  It's like a thousand times more evil than Kim Jong-un who's toddling around and, you know, they can't even get their automobiles to operate correctly.
[00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:19.140]  Because it's such statism.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:33.611]  But statism here got control of such a wealthy, powerful dynamo and was able to build a black pyramid of satanic power that is weak compared to the universe and the creator of the universe, the god of this creation.
[00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:39.168]  But on this planet is unbelievably sick and out of control.
[00:15:39.168 --> 00:15:43.550]  But I'll tell you this, the people, the technicians running this thing, they are not running it.
[00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.610]  They think they're running it.
[00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.071]  They think they're guiding it.
[00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:48.472]  They're more riding it.
[00:15:48.472 --> 00:15:49.813]  They're riding it.
[00:15:49.813 --> 00:15:52.474]  They're not in control of this tiger.
[00:15:52.474 --> 00:15:54.255]  I can tell you that right now.
[00:15:54.255 --> 00:16:02.859]  It is going to wreck the planet and we're going to see biblical end of days type stuff down the road if this keeps unfolding.
[00:16:03.803 --> 00:16:05.844]  People say, well then that's the way it is, you can't stop it.
[00:16:05.844 --> 00:16:08.345]  Look at Nineveh, a hundred year reprieve.
[00:16:08.345 --> 00:16:17.488]  Evil takes over when we give up, and we have a job, even if this is going to end up being end of days type stuff, you know, ten, twenty years down the road, maybe even sooner, I don't know.
[00:16:17.488 --> 00:16:23.251]  We have a responsibility to be warning people, not going to all these fake churches where they've taken the crosses out.
[00:16:24.093 --> 00:16:31.516]  And everybody's running around, you know, worshipping world government and paddling on their neighbors and learning how to worship, you know, the police and the police state.
[00:16:31.516 --> 00:16:33.677]  That's what they do at all the churches now.
[00:16:33.677 --> 00:16:38.680]  And just get into a statism, you know, weirdoism.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.001]  I mean, I mean, this is a society losing touch with reality.
[00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:47.343]  People watch TV shows where the bad guys cheat and steal and lie and it's cool, it's sexy.
[00:16:47.343 --> 00:16:50.545]  And you see people trying to follow that in their own lives.
[00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:52.346]  You see people trying to mimic deception.
[00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.791]  Trying to mimic manipulation.
[00:16:54.791 --> 00:17:11.363]  I was listening to a talk show host last night and major talk shows was re-aired locally and I was hearing about all the trust and trust me and all snake-like hissing at his listeners and sitting there trying to act like this pasty sweet person as a cover to like flypaper to bring them in.
[00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:13.744]  He's actually not a weak pasty effeminate person.
[00:17:13.744 --> 00:17:15.886]  I could tell that a couple layers down.
[00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:22.652]  And all about, trust me, don't trust anyone else, trust me, don't trust these other libertarians either, trust me, me.
[00:17:22.652 --> 00:17:25.275]  I couldn't even listen to it for like two minutes.
[00:17:25.275 --> 00:17:26.656]  Oh, trust me.
[00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:29.719]  No, don't trust Alex Jones, don't trust anybody.
[00:17:29.719 --> 00:17:32.662]  Except God, and trust verifying things.
[00:17:32.662 --> 00:17:34.984]  Going out and knowing the info.
[00:17:34.984 --> 00:17:37.246]  Don't, oh, I listen to this and trust it.
[00:17:38.209 --> 00:17:40.010]  I listen to that and trust that.
[00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.011]  Trust your own discernment.
[00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:43.511]  Trust your own research.
[00:17:43.511 --> 00:17:45.272]  Trust common sense.
[00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:47.993]  You have to do work to know what's going on.
[00:17:47.993 --> 00:17:50.234]  You have to do work to understand history.
[00:17:50.234 --> 00:17:52.255]  You have to study how elites operate.
[00:17:52.255 --> 00:17:56.917]  And then once you start getting more pieces of it, you light year ahead in your understanding.
[00:17:56.917 --> 00:17:57.677]  Here's what I'm saying.
[00:17:57.677 --> 00:18:00.259]  I cannot show you the New World Order.
[00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:00.719]  Okay?
[00:18:00.719 --> 00:18:03.480]  I cannot show you the New World Order.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:03.880]  Okay?
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.521]  Knowing it tears me apart.
[00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:15.829]  Okay, you're going to have to decide you want to see it, and you're going to have to decide, I mean it talks about on the Isle of Patmos, John the Revelator marveled at the beast.
[00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:18.249]  Well, I'm here to tell you folks, I marveled.
[00:18:18.249 --> 00:18:21.151]  And I'm not having some vision 2,000 years ago of what was coming.
[00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:35.616]  I'm watching it, and just looking at the parts of it, and I marvel the inventiveness of evil, stealing our ideas and twisting it, the counterfeiting, the inventing new evils, the running around constantly
[00:18:35.996 --> 00:18:57.776]  With, you know, new forms of wickedness, and the deception, and the spirit of giving into darkness, and just all of it, and to watch society sliding like the Titanic into the North Atlantic, freezing, you know, 35 degree water, and to see people spiritually going dark.
[00:18:58.817 --> 00:19:01.640]  To see the lights turning out in people's eyes.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.620]  And it's chemical, too.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.962]  I mean, it's just going to get wilder.
[00:19:04.962 --> 00:19:11.368]  All of this government openly running Al-Qaeda, and then saying the now-patriots are the terrorists, that's just the beginning.
[00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:18.995]  And they're making it over the top on purpose to acclimate people to accept stuff that's going to be a hundred times more crazy.
[00:19:19.395 --> 00:19:21.818]  Forced inoculations are already beginning.
[00:19:21.818 --> 00:19:23.780]  CPSing for no reason.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:31.688]  Checkpoints, bondage, prison time for a balloon going up in the air at a party or a battery in your backyard.
[00:19:31.688 --> 00:19:33.329]  Just cameras everywhere.
[00:19:33.329 --> 00:19:35.071]  Google Glasses watching you.
[00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:38.335]  People as agents of the NSA walking around like morons.
[00:19:39.135 --> 00:19:42.497]  Uh, the ultramagnetic wavelengths frying us.
[00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:44.319]  Cancer rates exploding.
[00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:49.362]  Just a cup of curses and disease and pain and plagues.
[00:19:49.362 --> 00:19:51.383]  The cup is just sloshing right now.
[00:19:51.383 --> 00:19:53.304]  Just small splashes are hitting us.
[00:19:53.304 --> 00:19:59.828]  And soon the whole cup is gonna just fall straight over as the hedge is lifted and pure evil rolls out.
[00:19:59.828 --> 00:20:00.489]  Rolls out!
[00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:04.551]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.

[00:22:30.915 --> 00:22:35.476]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.476 --> 00:22:41.279]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:44.920]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:24:37.262 --> 00:24:39.804]  As Robert Gibbs' conscience seems to be.
[00:24:39.804 --> 00:24:46.510]  What poets, the who.
[00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:51.393]  And I have confirmed from multiple sources they are multiple members, are big time listeners of the show.
[00:24:51.393 --> 00:24:52.775]  I want to say hi to them.
[00:24:52.775 --> 00:24:53.996]  Speaking of rock legends.
[00:24:55.404 --> 00:24:56.265]  Billy Corrigan.
[00:24:56.265 --> 00:24:56.905]  I was in town.
[00:24:56.905 --> 00:25:02.028]  I had time to hang out with him a couple of days off and on for South by Southwest.
[00:25:02.028 --> 00:25:05.790]  I went to an amazing birthday party with him and some of his old friends.
[00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.191]  I'm not going to tell that story.
[00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:10.153]  It was just a dinner for about three hours.
[00:25:10.153 --> 00:25:13.295]  Learned a lot from some of the biggest record executives in history.
[00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:15.276]  Household names for people that don't even follow that.
[00:25:15.276 --> 00:25:16.496]  I'm not name dropping.
[00:25:16.496 --> 00:25:20.079]  It's just amazing to get to spend three hours with people like that.
[00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:23.521]  Last year he took me to a private Facebook party that had their
[00:25:24.121 --> 00:25:24.181]  I'm
[00:25:45.507 --> 00:25:46.348]  Hi Billy, I want to say hi to you.
[00:25:46.348 --> 00:25:49.171]  I think you're down in Mexico right now, playing Mexico City.
[00:25:49.171 --> 00:25:51.214]  Claim to fame is Jessica Simpson's boyfriend.
[00:25:51.214 --> 00:25:52.656]  Tell you, you got to envy that.
[00:25:52.656 --> 00:25:54.257]  Okay, I'm being bad.
[00:25:54.257 --> 00:25:54.958]  I apologize.
[00:25:54.958 --> 00:25:58.723]  A little gallows humor here with the news I was just covering.
[00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:00.705]  Very powerful, very deep interview.
[00:26:00.705 --> 00:26:02.407]  It's about an hour long.
[00:26:02.407 --> 00:26:05.170]  We're going to air 20 minutes of it today on the radio.
[00:26:06.071 --> 00:26:11.374]  Uh, coming up, uh, at the start of the third hour, ahead of John Rappaport joining us.
[00:26:11.374 --> 00:26:20.380]  And then I'm going to air the whole thing end-to-end tonight, the first 20 minutes, and then the other 35 or so, I think it's 50-something minutes long.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.842]  We're gonna air that tonight on the Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central.
[00:26:23.842 --> 00:26:26.964]  Uh, if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, become one.
[00:26:28.285 --> 00:26:36.330]  But again, all this worldliness, and Billy is not really a very worldly person in the world, but all of that.
[00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:42.295]  The beauty of art, the wondrousness of my children, my wife, getting to meet amazing minds.
[00:26:43.513 --> 00:26:45.354]  I'm not into celebrity for celebrity's sake.
[00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:47.455]  I like to know interesting people.
[00:26:47.455 --> 00:27:01.501]  All of that pales and falls by the wayside when we don't have a future because we've allowed the very worst people in our culture and in our society to take control.
[00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:04.362]  We have turned
[00:27:06.423 --> 00:27:26.942]  Our culture and our society over to fraudsters, to con men, who are using in their own manuals, they write books bragging, are using psych warfare to create an Alice in Wonderland reality, and then they look at people like myself, who's trying to really nail down the closest reality, because none of us are perfect, we all see through rose-colored glasses.
[00:27:26.942 --> 00:27:30.105]  We all distort things, but I'm trying to really take the blue belt.
[00:27:33.285 --> 00:27:35.266]  You're like, what do you mean you're gonna take the blue pill?
[00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:38.048]  Well, because the Matrix is the red pill.
[00:27:38.048 --> 00:27:41.310]  You're like, what does that mean?
[00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.991]  The point is, everything is backwards with these people.
[00:27:43.991 --> 00:27:46.633]  It's the blue pill that really wakes you up.
[00:27:46.633 --> 00:27:48.534]  It's the red pill that keeps you in the Matrix.
[00:27:48.534 --> 00:27:54.297]  I know that in the movie, I know in the film, it's the red pill.
[00:27:54.297 --> 00:27:56.919]  You can say it's the red pill and it does wake you up in that movie.
[00:28:00.526 --> 00:28:07.467]  And again, I just threw that out to be confusing because I'm trying to figure out how to get people out of their trance.
[00:28:07.467 --> 00:28:10.468]  How to get people to go, wait, that doesn't make sense.
[00:28:10.468 --> 00:28:12.808]  You understand what I'm saying?
[00:28:12.808 --> 00:28:15.789]  What I just said didn't make sense.
[00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:23.470]  And the government's saying, we're going to take your rights because of Al-Qaeda while they publicly run them.
[00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:29.691]  You have to take the blue pill to want to live in their Alice in Wonderland to buy into that.
[00:28:31.451 --> 00:28:34.912]  And so I am really saying take the red pill.
[00:28:34.912 --> 00:28:46.394]  But do you see how we're in such a false reality with them that they just throw out whatever they want and then hope that people buy into the lie?
[00:28:46.394 --> 00:28:49.735]  And I hope what I just said isn't too confusing or too sophisticated.
[00:28:49.735 --> 00:28:51.935]  And I don't mean that in a condescending way.
[00:28:51.935 --> 00:28:57.056]  I'm simply trying to get people to think that things might not be what they're automatically told they are.
[00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:17.829]  And I am going to make a pretty big announcement at the bottom of the next hour after Greg Pallas leaves us, getting into the whole financial meltdown by design and the mega banks that he's tracked like no one else out there for 20 years.
[00:29:17.829 --> 00:29:20.370]  He was a former federal fraud investigator.
[00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.470]  I mean, of course, predicting they would start looting bank accounts.
[00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.251]  Greg Pallas is coming on.
[00:29:24.251 --> 00:29:27.973]  But my point, red pill, blue pill, it's more complex than that.
[00:29:29.282 --> 00:29:33.205]  And people are saying, hey, Alex will take you down the rabbit hole with the red pill.
[00:29:33.205 --> 00:29:37.667]  No, really, I'm trying to take you out of Alice in Wonderland.
[00:29:37.667 --> 00:29:41.830]  That's the world we're actually in, back into reality.
[00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:45.232]  So, see, that would be red pill into blue pill.
[00:29:45.232 --> 00:29:47.993]  But they're saying it's blue pill into red pill.
[00:29:47.993 --> 00:29:48.654]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:29:48.654 --> 00:29:49.975]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.975 --> 00:29:51.355]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.355 --> 00:29:53.897]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.897 --> 00:29:56.579]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.024 --> 00:30:04.426]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:30:04.426 --> 00:30:10.490]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:14.373]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:30:14.373 --> 00:30:15.954]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[00:30:15.954 --> 00:30:20.416]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[00:30:57.693 --> 00:30:59.856]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com
[00:31:01.445 --> 00:31:02.506]  I had tried everything.
[00:31:02.506 --> 00:31:07.992]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:31:07.992 --> 00:31:12.838]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:19.205]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:31:19.685 --> 00:31:30.891]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:30.891 --> 00:31:35.373]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:31:35.373 --> 00:31:38.375]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[00:31:38.735 --> 00:31:41.617]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:41.617 --> 00:31:43.199]  Now that's results.
[00:31:43.199 --> 00:31:49.984]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:31:49.984 --> 00:31:55.728]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:32:01.593 --> 00:32:07.478]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:32:08.334 --> 00:32:15.078]  At Silverlungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[00:32:15.078 --> 00:32:26.043]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano Silver Solutions, our 2-ounce Nano Silver Nasal Applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[00:32:26.043 --> 00:32:30.185]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[00:32:30.185 --> 00:32:36.369]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:32:37.109 --> 00:32:48.352]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:33:08.089 --> 00:33:10.651]  This is your last chance.
[00:33:10.651 --> 00:33:13.253]  After this, there is no turning back.
[00:33:13.253 --> 00:33:15.114]  You take the blue pill.
[00:33:15.114 --> 00:33:16.875]  The story ends.
[00:33:16.875 --> 00:33:20.338]  You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
[00:33:20.338 --> 00:33:21.879]  You take the red pill.
[00:33:21.879 --> 00:33:24.521]  You stay in Wonderland.
[00:33:24.521 --> 00:33:29.044]  And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[00:33:29.044 --> 00:33:32.546]  Remember, all I'm offering is the truth.
[00:33:32.546 --> 00:33:33.227]  Nothing more.
[00:33:36.212 --> 00:33:40.635]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:40.635 --> 00:33:51.041]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:51.041 --> 00:33:58.245]  You know, the fact that this radio show is growing by leaps and bounds in its popularity is a very positive point.
[00:33:58.245 --> 00:34:03.929]  But I also realize I have a great responsibility as someone who's real to try to really do the best job I can
[00:34:05.657 --> 00:34:14.123]  But at the same time, none of us can overanalyze ourselves and then get so obsessed with being perfect that we don't engage in the fight against tyrants.
[00:34:14.123 --> 00:34:24.430]  The most important thing to do is to want reality and to want the truth above all things and to then confront those that are selling lies.
[00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:33.556]  Because you could talk about it red pill, blue pill, but yes, the establishment, to use the Matrix analogy, they want us to take the blue pill and stay in the Matrix.
[00:34:36.286 --> 00:34:45.032]  Okay, which is physically real in their world, the machine world, but in our minds when they jack into our brains.
[00:34:45.032 --> 00:34:51.917]  But if you look at it from the modern perspective, they always talk about patriots are going to take you down the rabbit hole.
[00:34:51.917 --> 00:34:59.522]  No, again, I want to climb out of Alice in Wonderland, up to the surface and find out what the real reality is.
[00:34:59.522 --> 00:35:02.585]  And to use that Plato's allegory of the cave,
[00:35:03.365 --> 00:35:20.572]  George Lucas' first film with Robert Duvall that's excellent, THX-1138, that's the name of the drugged, brainwashed, subloid creature under the control of a scientific technocracy in underground labyrinth cities of the future that are actually the plan of
[00:35:21.852 --> 00:35:40.681]  Aldous Huxley who was only writing about the plan of the globalists and who admitted in speeches and in Brave New World Revisited that this is an actual plan that the British aristocracy and technological military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about planned to build.
[00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:46.964]  So that's how I know what they're going to do because they've told us what they're going to do and that's what's frustrating about it.
[00:35:46.964 --> 00:35:48.205]  It's like we're in an underground city
[00:35:49.221 --> 00:36:03.849]  It has glass walls and a glass roof above it, and we can see the sun and moon and a mountain range off in the distance, and we can even see wild humans that are more free in other countries compared to us, and they're telling us, no, you don't see that out there.
[00:36:03.849 --> 00:36:06.530]  We're not underground told this is our whole world.
[00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.252]  We're not chained up looking at a projection stream on a wall.
[00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:40.760]  We are here able to see the fraud, able to see the lies, able to pick up the books written a hundred years ago, seventy years ago, thirty years ago, ten years ago, a year ago, admitting it's a false reality, admitting they're lying to us, admitting they've bought off the media, admitting they're breaking up the family, admitting they want a post-industrial world for you and I, but not for them, admitting they believe they're going to merge with machines and live forever, but before they can do that they've got to kill us.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.121]  In some survival of the fittest mega battle.
[00:36:44.121 --> 00:36:47.342]  I mean, this is a stinking nightmare!
[00:36:47.342 --> 00:36:50.063]  And they're building it!
[00:36:50.063 --> 00:36:51.744]  People say, why don't you talk about Google Glasses more?
[00:36:51.744 --> 00:36:52.644]  They're so hot now.
[00:36:52.644 --> 00:36:54.505]  This has actually captured people's imagination.
[00:36:54.505 --> 00:36:56.305]  They're actually concerned.
[00:36:56.305 --> 00:36:58.286]  Because I talked about Google Glasses ten years ago.
[00:36:59.363 --> 00:37:08.807]  The globalists, the transhumanists that are really the eugenicists have said this is going to empower humanity, but the problem is they've built back doors into it in the architecture to make sure it enslaves us.
[00:37:08.807 --> 00:37:14.510]  And then they falsely cast those of us that are against this as anti-technology when it's the opposite.
[00:37:15.848 --> 00:37:28.994]  They are building a technology that's deployed to us, that we're allowed to use, that's run by DARPA, by MIT, and their front Google, and their front Apple, which are fronts on record, just like Microsoft.
[00:37:28.994 --> 00:37:41.580]  You can go research right now, we've written articles, we've had guests on, CIA technology analyst, like Steele and others, he got threats over it, wouldn't come back on after it happened, now it's mainstream news, he was on like eight years ago.
[00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:47.534]  It's on record Microsoft is an IBM Defense Department front.
[00:37:47.534 --> 00:37:50.796]  Because they had to get around antitrust laws back when it was still somewhat of a Congress.
[00:37:50.796 --> 00:37:52.617]  They like to have the illusion of groups.
[00:37:52.617 --> 00:37:55.098]  It's on record Apple's a government front.
[00:37:55.098 --> 00:37:57.740]  Steve Jobs, all that, a total fiction.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.381]  Sure, they're top futurists for the globalists.
[00:37:59.381 --> 00:38:03.864]  They were actually running a lot of things, but they didn't create it.
[00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:07.006]  All these myths, IBM, Microsoft, Google,
[00:38:08.749 --> 00:38:13.553]  They're all in Q-Tel and other CIA DARPA subsidiary run.
[00:38:13.553 --> 00:38:14.754]  I mean, go look it up.
[00:38:14.754 --> 00:38:17.376]  It's hiding in plain view.
[00:38:17.376 --> 00:38:20.498]  It's hiding in plain view they put cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:22.620]  I mean, you want your kids to die?
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.221]  You want to die?
[00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:24.282]  Have you looked at the cancer numbers?
[00:38:24.282 --> 00:38:25.703]  I know I talk about this all day.
[00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:27.644]  They're killing us!
[00:38:27.644 --> 00:38:34.029]  But it's so over the top, most people don't even know what to say or what to do, okay?
[00:38:34.029 --> 00:38:38.213]  Well, get mad, get focused, understand what's going on, start speaking out.
[00:38:40.476 --> 00:38:47.034]  Even if you stand there in front of your mirror saying, I'm going to do something, I'm going to stand up, I'm going to be a leader, that's the beginning of doing it in the real world.
[00:38:48.615 --> 00:38:52.176]  I'm committed to this 110% and again, I'm going to explain this to you.
[00:38:52.176 --> 00:38:54.056]  There are things worse than physical death.
[00:38:54.056 --> 00:38:56.477]  There are things worse than an individual dying.
[00:38:56.477 --> 00:39:03.119]  As a man, I was born to build a civilization for my family and a future for them with your family.
[00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:05.340]  You were born to build a civilization.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:13.662]  As a man or a woman, you were built to build a family and a culture of true equity and genuineness and true renaissance.
[00:39:14.582 --> 00:39:18.906]  You were built to design and create in the image of your creator.
[00:39:18.906 --> 00:39:23.970]  And so, not following God's programming is what I fear.
[00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:32.137]  And not because I am some goody-two-shoes person, but because I understand the real path.
[00:39:32.137 --> 00:39:36.321]  And that is what creates the prosperity.
[00:39:36.321 --> 00:39:39.884]  The problem is future generations come that do not have to
[00:39:41.218 --> 00:40:01.848]  Fight for anything and so they become jellyfish and begin to attack and create false systems of thought to ridicule and debase those that are warning them because they see it as like their mom telling them take out the garbage and they think mom or dad is telling them that to be mean to them not because mom and dad don't want you to be lazy fools.
[00:40:01.848 --> 00:40:06.570]  Spoiled rotten children is what we've all become to one extent or another.
[00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.891]  Prosperity makes monsters.
[00:40:10.208 --> 00:40:14.569]  Adversity makes men.
[00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:37.874]  And so we're here, where the government publicly runs Al Qaeda, and every day or two there's a new video with them murdering Christians, blowing up churches, murdering Muslim minority groups like Alawites, blowing up police stations, killing families, making fathers suicide bomb, or they kill their family.
[00:40:39.608 --> 00:40:44.871]  And our media goes, Assad claims he didn't suicide bomb his government building.
[00:40:44.871 --> 00:40:47.552]  That dirty Assad's with Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:47.552 --> 00:40:49.613]  They actually have it in the paper.
[00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:55.356]  And then the New York Times runs video of, look at these freedom fighters making somebody suicide bomb or they kill his family.
[00:40:55.356 --> 00:40:57.657]  And then people got upset so they pulled the video down.
[00:40:57.657 --> 00:40:59.317]  But see, that was a psych warfare test.
[00:40:59.317 --> 00:41:00.078]  Can we show them?
[00:41:01.874 --> 00:41:06.818]  Making a guy drive a truck to blow up a police checkpoint?
[00:41:06.818 --> 00:41:08.479]  Or they kill their family?
[00:41:08.479 --> 00:41:13.703]  Can we show that?
[00:41:13.703 --> 00:41:14.684]  Can we show that?
[00:41:19.693 --> 00:41:21.154]  And then have no one care.
[00:41:21.154 --> 00:41:23.976]  I mean, they are assaulting your morals, folks.
[00:41:23.976 --> 00:41:30.121]  You don't have morals because they've sold it like you're some goody two-shoe that doesn't want, you know, to have a party with the cheerleaders.
[00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:34.885]  You know, the devil's a whole bunch of hot cheerleaders with horns going, come on, baby, let's party.
[00:41:34.885 --> 00:41:39.489]  Don't let that square keep you from it.
[00:41:39.489 --> 00:41:43.532]  The devil is piles of dead children, folks, with maggots crawling all over them.
[00:41:47.415 --> 00:41:50.217]  I just don't want to go down that road, and we're going down that road.
[00:41:50.217 --> 00:41:57.843]  We're turning loose and empowering the worst minds, the worst craven hearts, who don't want control just for simple power.
[00:41:57.843 --> 00:41:59.784]  There's been a lot of elites like that.
[00:41:59.784 --> 00:42:10.752]  Sometimes they actually build up powerful societies, but it always gets taken over by some bad person.
[00:42:10.752 --> 00:42:15.656]  I just want to survive, and if they can shell us on Al Qaeda openly working for the globalists,
[00:42:16.752 --> 00:42:21.354]  And then because it doesn't fit the script we were already given, we don't make a big issue out of it.
[00:42:21.354 --> 00:42:28.698]  If they can sell us on that, they can sell us on anything.
[00:42:28.698 --> 00:42:33.141]  It's just that simple.
[00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:33.261]  And...
[00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:44.415]  Society is already collapsing, but they just paper it over with propaganda so that it becomes the norm, and then if you point out we're going in the wrong direction, they just go conspiracy theorist.
[00:42:44.415 --> 00:42:54.419]  They now say if you have a political view, like, I think Google Glasses, with them saying you're an agent of Google and the NSA, I mean, they're saying, new technology will make us agents of Google.
[00:42:54.419 --> 00:42:59.242]  Director of the Big Brother Watch says, the implications of privacy are profoundly worrying.
[00:42:59.242 --> 00:42:59.982]  London Telegraph.
[00:43:03.038 --> 00:43:05.439]  And then they come out and say, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:43:05.439 --> 00:43:08.360]  Everyone's going to have glasses with their phone and everything on it.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.762]  They'll just stop manufacturing the regular phones.
[00:43:10.762 --> 00:43:12.883]  If you want it, you'll have to get it.
[00:43:12.883 --> 00:43:16.104]  All the stars are already, you know, getting them and, oh, it's so sexy.
[00:43:16.104 --> 00:43:17.305]  We've got to do it.
[00:43:17.305 --> 00:43:18.705]  Everybody goes out and gets it.
[00:43:18.705 --> 00:43:22.987]  And then it's, oh, now you're getting a chip in your head to access everything.
[00:43:22.987 --> 00:43:24.548]  Sorry if you don't want to.
[00:43:24.548 --> 00:43:26.469]  You just won't have access to anything, be able to have a job.
[00:43:28.123 --> 00:43:29.744]  And that's what Ray Kurzweil and the U.N.
[00:43:29.744 --> 00:43:30.324]  say.
[00:43:30.324 --> 00:43:32.066]  You will take the brain chip.
[00:43:32.066 --> 00:43:33.006]  You're going to take it.
[00:43:33.006 --> 00:43:34.147]  That's in the official U.N.
[00:43:34.147 --> 00:43:35.288]  documents.
[00:43:35.288 --> 00:43:37.889]  And then, 15 years ago, I'm like, read these U.N.
[00:43:37.889 --> 00:43:38.550]  documents.
[00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:48.857]  You know, read this forward to a book written by Newt Gingrich, the globalist, calling for world government and all of us to have brain chips to control everyone, and it'll create a utopia.
[00:43:48.857 --> 00:43:50.798]  Sounds like a nightmare, because it's run by these people.
[00:43:54.329 --> 00:43:55.370]  Don't you get it?
[00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:58.352]  If God put a brain chip in us, it wouldn't be a problem.
[00:43:58.352 --> 00:44:00.593]  But the devil wants to put a brain chip in you.
[00:44:00.593 --> 00:44:03.475]  The people running the machine are bad.
[00:44:03.475 --> 00:44:06.657]  The people running the Google Glasses are bad.
[00:44:06.657 --> 00:44:13.401]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, Google Glasses, once they're perfected, will be a great tool for us with the police, or government people, or to infiltrate things.
[00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:15.763]  The problem is, it's jacked into Skynet.
[00:44:16.815 --> 00:44:29.941]  It's a little robot you put on your head, spying on everything, and it's not you recording it to your device or to the memory device in the clasp that go on the side of your head.
[00:44:29.941 --> 00:44:31.622]  It's jacked into Sauron.
[00:44:31.622 --> 00:44:33.903]  It's a two-way crystal ball.
[00:44:33.903 --> 00:44:39.265]  It's two-way jacked into the New World Order.
[00:44:39.265 --> 00:44:42.067]  I'm all for better glasses coming out that have hidden cameras in them.
[00:44:42.067 --> 00:44:42.647]  We've got some.
[00:44:43.922 --> 00:44:44.483]  That's great.
[00:44:44.483 --> 00:44:45.804]  That's the individual in power.
[00:44:45.804 --> 00:44:46.344]  This isn't.
[00:44:46.344 --> 00:44:51.929]  This is a crystal ball, and that's their own words, that sees two ways.
[00:44:51.929 --> 00:44:53.651]  What does Gandalf say to Sauron?
[00:44:53.651 --> 00:44:55.312]  You're not supposed to have a crystal ball like this.
[00:44:55.312 --> 00:44:55.793]  We don't know.
[00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:57.654]  Who else is watching?
[00:44:57.654 --> 00:44:58.875]  Sauron?
[00:44:58.875 --> 00:44:59.936]  Or Saruman?
[00:44:59.936 --> 00:45:03.920]  Why should we be afraid to use it?
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.001]  And see, that's the lie.
[00:45:05.001 --> 00:45:07.443]  I mean, we're about to be given the apple.
[00:45:07.443 --> 00:45:09.005]  The true knowledge of good and evil.
[00:45:10.083 --> 00:45:24.694]  I mean, the world is about to just hyper-accelerate towards the singularity, and unbelievable things are going to happen, and then we should have a debate about what's happening, but instead of a commoner has any debate about this and says, hey, this is run by bad people, this architecture is not designed organically.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.401]  People are like, shut up conspiracy theorists, there's nothing to fear.
[00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:30.881]  There's nothing to fear.
[00:45:30.881 --> 00:45:35.943]  You better know you've been warned about the vaccines, the hydrofluorosilicic fluoride water.
[00:45:35.943 --> 00:45:38.164]  You've been warned about GMO.
[00:45:38.164 --> 00:45:44.346]  You've been warned a hundred percent it's designed to slowly kill you and then absorb you into a medical system that's nationalized.
[00:45:44.926 --> 00:45:55.753]  They had to have it nationalized to have the death actuaries and the death panels to kill you and normalize it and the vaccine damage fund with the millions of damaged kids per country.
[00:45:55.753 --> 00:46:08.682]  All nations have these now that are under globalist control to just normalize and standardize our extermination to where it's going to get where half your block's dying of cancer and there's mass burials going on and there'll be no discussion of why it's happening.
[00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:17.238]  Just like there's hardly any discussion of why have we gone from 1 in 25,000 with autism to 1 in 58 in 30 years.
[00:46:17.238 --> 00:46:22.264]  Just like there's no discussion of why is pediatric cancer up over 10,000% since the 1960s.
[00:46:22.264 --> 00:46:25.648]  Just like there's no discussion of why is breast cancer up several thousand percentage points.
[00:46:25.648 --> 00:46:28.952]  It's all about find a cure, not why is everybody getting it now?
[00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.213]  We're being killed!
[00:46:32.128 --> 00:46:49.354]  By a bunch of nuts who obsessively keep themselves away from all this stuff, and while they drink purified water and have cures and treatments for themselves, and then they say, sure, there's some blowback, it's hurting top technocrats, but they don't care because killing you, for their god, is so much more important.
[00:46:51.690 --> 00:47:02.183]  And it tears my guts out because it's just, I mean, I look at my five-year-old daughter who is the image of innocence and goodness and just, you can really see God's.
[00:47:03.396 --> 00:47:15.008]  Handiwork there, not just in a sunset, not just in a moonrise, not just in the ocean, not just a little fish in a pond, looking down and flowers and the smell and everything and all the things God gives us.
[00:47:15.008 --> 00:47:23.076]  Men and women and our relationships and futures and everything and creativity, all of it that's beautiful and the system likes ugliness.
[00:47:23.076 --> 00:47:24.217]  Can I get that through your head?
[00:47:24.938 --> 00:47:27.860]  The system wants to take all that and wreck it, and it is.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:34.243]  Everything the globalists actually do, if you take the red pill and get outside the matrix, is wreck things.
[00:47:34.243 --> 00:47:37.525]  All telling you is you see the wreckage, oh give us more power, we'll fix it.
[00:47:37.525 --> 00:47:46.009]  And then you give them more power, and they move the wrecking forward faster.
[00:47:46.009 --> 00:47:47.450]  And I am not just content
[00:47:48.393 --> 00:47:51.634]  To sit here and be a talk show host and fight these people.
[00:47:51.634 --> 00:47:57.717]  I am not content to just play it safe and only go at half speed against these people and not get killed.
[00:47:57.717 --> 00:48:08.861]  I am going to go full power and I am asking God to give me the discernment and to beam me the information to really absolutely throw myself 110%.
[00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:09.861]  I ask God to throw me 100% against the enemy.
[00:48:14.284 --> 00:48:18.425]  I don't, whatever the consequences are, I do not want this to continue.
[00:48:18.425 --> 00:48:20.465]  And again, it's not because I'm a hero.
[00:48:20.465 --> 00:48:23.706]  It's because I know there's no way out but to do that.
[00:48:23.706 --> 00:48:33.368]  To throw ourselves 100% against the New World Order and all of its rotten, stinking works.
[00:48:33.368 --> 00:48:36.608]  Now, the question is before you.
[00:48:36.608 --> 00:48:38.009]  What are you going to do?
[00:48:38.009 --> 00:48:39.569]  You have got to break the matrix.
[00:48:41.192 --> 00:48:45.834]  You have got to focus in that we, they're trying to put us into an Alice in Wonderland thing.
[00:48:45.834 --> 00:48:46.775]  What did Karl Rove said?
[00:48:46.775 --> 00:48:52.778]  He said, we control reality and we'll tell you something ridiculous tomorrow, but you will report it like it's real.
[00:48:52.778 --> 00:48:59.201]  And the press then, so they have access, so they get the press releases first, and so they get to go to these little meetings.
[00:48:59.201 --> 00:49:01.462]  They will do anything to get that access.
[00:49:01.462 --> 00:49:05.824]  But now notice, the globalists don't even need to give you access.
[00:49:05.824 --> 00:49:08.685]  Now they're saying, we may just stop having press conferences altogether.
[00:49:08.685 --> 00:49:10.166]  There may just be a virtual president.
[00:49:10.885 --> 00:49:12.867]  You may never see the President again.
[00:49:12.867 --> 00:49:20.814]  See, they're purposefully blurring the lines between three-dimensional reality and their false digital reality.
[00:49:20.814 --> 00:49:28.480]  And then through peer pressure and ridicule, giggle and laugh at people as we phase into a false reality.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:34.145]  They're going to more and more say, join the false reality and be given perks of the machine.
[00:49:34.145 --> 00:49:38.469]  If you don't join the false reality, you are going to be listed as a terrorist.
[00:49:40.103 --> 00:49:43.346]  Yeah, but they have to put you in the false reality because they have a plan.
[00:49:43.346 --> 00:49:44.968]  They've just been testing it so far.
[00:49:44.968 --> 00:49:50.714]  They'd probably be at 12 billion people if it wasn't for their programs, the UN estimates, so it's only 7.5 billion.
[00:49:50.714 --> 00:49:56.720]  It's going to crest at about 8.5 billion, and then they plan a mass exterminism down to 500 million is what most numbers show.
[00:49:57.597 --> 00:50:00.079]  Some public numbers are a billion, 100 million.
[00:50:00.079 --> 00:50:03.922]  They kind of tell their own minions that because they don't want to do the math, figure out they're dead next.
[00:50:03.922 --> 00:50:19.213]  But once they get people drugged enough, and once they've got the police doing what they say and following crazy orders, they're then going to release viruses that are actually RNA-constructed nanotech, this has all been announced, that are going to hit everybody.
[00:50:19.213 --> 00:50:20.955]  But I believe that, you know, this is spiritual.
[00:50:20.955 --> 00:50:22.556]  I believe the spirit is going to override it.
[00:50:24.123 --> 00:50:27.684]  And there's evidence to some, they've already tested this, and a lot of people are immune.
[00:50:27.684 --> 00:50:30.104]  Because they don't want to have it too strong, they're testing it.
[00:50:30.104 --> 00:50:46.188]  Viruses that give you select lobotomies of the spirit-connected centers, where your brain plugs into the spirit, they want to attack the soul seat, the pineal gland, that's what the fluoride's about, and you're going to see mass zombie-ism.
[00:50:46.188 --> 00:50:50.689]  And so they're now, but not real undead, just lobotomized people.
[00:50:51.149 --> 00:50:56.732]  And that's why they're creating a race memory in humans now to accept the zombie collapse.
[00:50:56.732 --> 00:51:01.514]  They're first going to release the viral attack before the mass extermination.
[00:51:01.514 --> 00:51:05.296]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[00:51:05.296 --> 00:51:08.538]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[00:51:08.538 --> 00:51:11.359]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:13.480]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.322]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[00:52:08.483 --> 00:52:17.448]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[00:54:25.151 --> 00:54:27.392]  Yeah!
[00:54:27.392 --> 00:54:42.181]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are on the edge of this, already entering it.
[00:54:42.181 --> 00:54:45.003]  Entering the New World Order.
[00:54:45.003 --> 00:54:47.845]  And these are the times that will make and break humanity.
[00:54:48.956 --> 00:54:57.963]  The true danger is to the species and the society and that our species remains somewhat intact into the future.
[00:54:57.963 --> 00:55:09.232]  The ultimate act of vandalism by the globalist, seeking after their father's work, is to destroy the species irrevocably itself.
[00:55:09.232 --> 00:55:13.455]  To genetically mutate it, twist it, and turn it into an abomination.
[00:55:18.208 --> 00:55:18.949]  And that is the goal.
[00:55:18.949 --> 00:55:22.471]  Whether you believe in God or not, the globalists are the devil.
[00:55:22.471 --> 00:55:28.496]  All traits described in the Bible, all traits that I have experienced of the enemy, it is real.
[00:55:28.496 --> 00:55:33.319]  Whether you believe in a spiritual entity or not, it is manifesting.
[00:55:33.319 --> 00:55:34.320]  It is manifesting.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.462]  You could use the fantastic planet analogy.
[00:55:37.462 --> 00:55:43.087]  They don't understand the big machine they found on the planet, but it's being run by the subconscious mind of Dr. Morpheus.
[00:55:45.344 --> 00:55:55.517]  Whatever you want to say, we've seen this before and now it's not just going to do what Nero did, it's going to have high-tech systems to play God.
[00:55:55.517 --> 00:55:59.543]  And this God is the God of this world.
[00:55:59.543 --> 00:56:01.045]  This God is not a God at all.
[00:56:05.697 --> 00:56:08.539]  By the way, DrugsReport.com has linked to our story.
[00:56:08.539 --> 00:56:12.242]  Big Sis refuses to answer Congress on bullet purchases.
[00:56:12.242 --> 00:56:15.864]  There was another congressman who said he's asked her about it and not got a response.
[00:56:15.864 --> 00:56:25.070]  Now another congressman, We Are Change, and we're going to play this later, DHS stays mum as members probe for explanations.
[00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:28.713]  So, now we've learned that there's at least two congressmen
[00:56:32.435 --> 00:56:35.177]  Who have tried to get answers on this.
[00:56:35.177 --> 00:56:38.619]  This is Congressman Timothy Hulescamp, I believe you pronounce it.
[00:56:38.619 --> 00:56:40.320]  I'm going to try to get him on.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:52.307]  Revealed this week the Department of Homeland Security has refused to answer questions from multiple members of Congress regarding its recent purchase of huge amounts of weapons and ammunition.
[00:56:52.307 --> 00:56:56.410]  And he goes on to say they have refused to answer that and a host of other questions.
[00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:59.591]  Well yeah, they wouldn't let him see PDD 51.
[00:56:59.591 --> 00:57:02.013]  Which the summary says makes the President a dictator.
[00:57:05.322 --> 00:57:09.365]  We also talked to Senator Graham and he said, look, we can kill whoever we want.
[00:57:09.365 --> 00:57:10.946]  We're not the SS.
[00:57:10.946 --> 00:57:11.647]  Talk about a headline.
[00:57:11.647 --> 00:57:12.928]  That's another article right there.
[00:57:12.928 --> 00:57:15.289]  Senator Graham, we're not the SS.
[00:57:15.289 --> 00:57:20.733]  We're very moral.
[00:57:20.733 --> 00:57:23.135]  I saw those videos yesterday and sent them over to the Watsons.
[00:57:23.135 --> 00:57:26.538]  That's why there's reports coming out on it.
[00:57:26.538 --> 00:57:30.841]  And my point in bringing that up is that I'm just describing how they blew me away.
[00:57:32.073 --> 00:57:35.696]  I mean, we are changed just as the model of citizen journalism right now.
[00:57:35.696 --> 00:57:43.182]  In fact, Luke was even going to come to work here and was ready to do it, but I said, you know, you're doing such a good job, you just do your own thing.
[00:57:43.182 --> 00:57:50.227]  We don't need to... We don't need to... What's the cartoon where all the little robots combine to make the big robot?
[00:57:50.227 --> 00:57:53.230]  We've had a bunch of those in Japanese animation.
[00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:54.651]  Voltron, yeah, we don't need you to...
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.781]  We don't need to create Voltron.
[00:57:57.781 --> 00:57:58.401]  I don't think so.
[00:57:58.401 --> 00:58:01.683]  We need to have a lot of people out there, a lot of people out there doing other things.
[00:58:01.683 --> 00:58:03.363]  Just amazing.
[00:58:03.363 --> 00:58:05.244]  So I salute the work they're doing.
[00:58:05.244 --> 00:58:09.266]  And that's up at DrudgeReport.com, right up at the top on the left-hand side.
[00:58:09.266 --> 00:58:11.127]  We can punch that up for TV viewers.
[00:58:11.127 --> 00:58:14.429]  And again, the good news is we're having an effect against the globalists.
[00:58:14.429 --> 00:58:16.290]  Remember, they said there are no bullets.
[00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:16.870]  But there are.
[00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:17.330]  It's public.
[00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:17.770]  They bought them.
[00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.011]  They just won't answer Congress.
[00:58:19.011 --> 00:58:24.073]  So we'll just keep pushing it like Fast and Furious, which they tried to stonewall the entire time.
[00:58:24.073 --> 00:58:25.354]  Remember, that didn't exist for a couple years?
[00:58:26.971 --> 00:58:30.392]  And again, the issue is that they stonewall you.
[00:58:30.392 --> 00:58:36.595]  And the minute you realize that's because they can't debate us, it's not strength, it's their weakness.
[00:58:36.595 --> 00:58:43.397]  Big announcement coming up.
[00:58:43.397 --> 00:58:47.379]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.269 --> 00:58:55.054]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[00:58:55.054 --> 00:58:58.319]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[00:58:58.319 --> 00:59:01.123]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:59:01.123 --> 00:59:03.266]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:59:03.266 --> 00:59:06.230]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[00:59:53.766 --> 00:59:56.147]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.147 --> 00:59:58.948]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:10.336]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.336 --> 01:00:11.917]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:13.458]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:17.661]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.661 --> 01:00:21.744]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.843 --> 01:00:40.289]  Coming up in the next segment, Greg Pallast, BBC, ABC News reporter, fraud investigator, has a lot of courage.
[01:00:40.289 --> 01:00:41.450]  He's been arrested, you name it.
[01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:50.336]  Remember, Homeland Security tried to arrest him for terrorism, for videotaping FEMA camps a few years ago after Katrina.
[01:00:50.336 --> 01:00:53.739]  They said, you're not allowed to show how people are living, even just shoot it from the road.
[01:00:53.739 --> 01:00:58.302]  Well, they put out the arrest warrant for him, but then people said, well, that's crazy.
[01:00:58.302 --> 01:00:59.283]  This is America.
[01:00:59.283 --> 01:01:00.704]  See, they want to just get you used to it.
[01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:11.227]  Well, he has been predicting what's going to happen in Europe and here, as the mega-banks implode the country, sinus onto their debt, and take money out of our bank accounts.
[01:01:11.227 --> 01:01:16.232]  And Chase, of course, having 0% balances a few days ago, a quote, glitch.
[01:01:16.232 --> 01:01:17.133]  It's all trial balloons.
[01:01:17.133 --> 01:01:24.299]  They're all testing cashless society systems, in my estimation, to turn off all your cards during any civil unrest.
[01:01:24.299 --> 01:01:25.260]  To just shut the grid down.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.641]  It's the internet kill switch.
[01:01:28.971 --> 01:01:33.854]  Cashless Society, Killswitch, they admit they've been developing, and that's all this is.
[01:01:33.854 --> 01:01:36.476]  JPMorgan Chase is the government of this country.
[01:01:36.476 --> 01:01:37.896]  It is the New World Order.
[01:01:37.896 --> 01:01:45.401]  It is the financial corporate heart of these interlocking combines.
[01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:46.522]  And they are anti-free market.
[01:01:46.522 --> 01:01:48.163]  They want a global monopoly and a
[01:01:49.335 --> 01:02:03.819]  Dumbed-down population living as serfs in giant government-run, surveilled ghettos, where they live in lavish mini-cities in the most beautiful areas in the world, protected by robot drones and sentries.
[01:02:03.819 --> 01:02:05.880]  Just go read what Ray Kurzweil writes.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.780]  And he just says, look, it doesn't matter the singularity.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.321]  We'll just step on you like you're a bug.
[01:02:09.321 --> 01:02:11.081]  You know, will we get rid of humanity?
[01:02:11.081 --> 01:02:12.622]  You're bugs.
[01:02:12.622 --> 01:02:13.722]  It wanted to be a discussion.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.262]  After they all say, you're already bugs.
[01:02:17.262 --> 01:02:19.163]  We're merging with the mega-computer.
[01:02:19.163 --> 01:02:22.485]  We're merging with HAL 9000.
[01:02:22.485 --> 01:02:24.907]  Dave, I'm afraid, Dave.
[01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:30.831]  And what's crazy about the globalists is they're in control through all their scamming and scheming, but they're always messing up.
[01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:32.533]  They just keep doing the same plan.
[01:02:32.533 --> 01:02:34.854]  When first you don't succeed, try, try again.
[01:02:34.854 --> 01:02:39.498]  And so people are like, well, you know, if they don't always get what they want and usually end up failing, well, what's the problem?
[01:02:39.498 --> 01:02:41.339]  Well, they'll end up destroying us in the process.
[01:02:41.339 --> 01:02:42.240]  They must be stopped.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:52.386]  Because the most radical of them, the most out of control of them, end up getting in the power positions because they shove the others down.
[01:02:52.386 --> 01:02:54.207]  Because what does British Special Forces say?
[01:02:54.207 --> 01:03:07.255]  It's an old saying, came before them, but it's their creed, their credo, their maxim, their signet, their battle cry, Fortune favors the bold.
[01:03:07.255 --> 01:03:09.497]  Fortune favors the bold.
[01:03:09.497 --> 01:03:10.117]  And I agree.
[01:03:10.117 --> 01:03:12.339]  It's true, fortune does favor the bold.
[01:03:14.434 --> 01:03:20.728]  And I'll make a bold announcement and point out the Emperor's butt-nakedness in T-minus 25 minutes.
[01:03:20.728 --> 01:03:22.051]  The government's got all my phones tapped.
[01:03:22.051 --> 01:03:22.773]  They already know what it is.
[01:03:24.403 --> 01:03:39.394]  The government, the mafia that uses my tax money to build this big monstrosity so they can perch up there and wear black ties and white shirts and walk around imagining they're secret agents following some false mind control template of their importance.
[01:03:39.394 --> 01:03:41.335]  You're important when you join humanity.
[01:03:41.335 --> 01:03:43.537]  You're important when you break the chains of control.
[01:03:43.537 --> 01:03:45.358]  You're important when you come out of the matrix.
[01:03:45.358 --> 01:03:47.700]  You're important when you fight for your family and humanity.
[01:03:48.797 --> 01:03:58.139]  Instead of playing the part of you're part of the technocracy and humanity's a cancer that you're gonna control and corral and cull, you're being culled and you know it.
[01:03:58.139 --> 01:04:05.620]  You weren't given the memo, but justice says you'll be given a warning and I'm here to give you the warning.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.561]  It's dictated that you be given a warning.
[01:04:08.561 --> 01:04:10.101]  It's metaphysical.
[01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:11.101]  It's spiritual.
[01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:12.022]  It's a rule.
[01:04:12.022 --> 01:04:12.802]  And that's why I'm here.
[01:04:12.802 --> 01:04:14.362]  That's why I'm allowed to continue to operate.
[01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:19.156]  And so I ask you, what are you going to do?
[01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:24.318]  Are you going to let them tell you there are no bullets, there's no Al-Qaeda working with the government when they publicly admit it?
[01:04:24.318 --> 01:04:29.881]  Are you going to let them tell you there's no checkpoints on the highway, or there's no First Amendment, but there is a First Amendment?
[01:04:29.881 --> 01:04:33.503]  Are you going to let them tell you, oh, there's no new taxes on poor people, but there are on Obamacare?
[01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:39.207]  Are you going to let them tell you there are no drone strikes, as Robert Gibbs said, the man behind the curtain?
[01:04:39.207 --> 01:04:41.688]  Or are you going to pull down the little guy behind the curtain?
[01:04:44.252 --> 01:04:50.501]  You know, I love how in the new movie they've cast the man behind the curtain as the good guy.
[01:04:50.501 --> 01:04:53.685]  He's deceiving everyone to defeat a greater evil.
[01:04:53.685 --> 01:04:56.850]  The truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies.
[01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.774]  What about when the devil is guarded by a bodyguard of lies?
[01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:09.709]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:13.390]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:17.832]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:05:17.832 --> 01:05:22.533]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[01:07:00.327 --> 01:07:03.350]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:08.354]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:07:08.354 --> 01:07:15.540]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:21.306]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:07:57.395 --> 01:07:58.056]  Are you?
[01:07:58.056 --> 01:07:59.156]  InfoWarshop.com
[01:08:05.612 --> 01:08:10.454]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:12.034]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.034 --> 01:08:13.575]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.575 --> 01:08:17.777]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.777 --> 01:08:23.859]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:30.241]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I am going to expose that the Emperor is absolutely naked.
[01:08:30.241 --> 01:08:31.702]  I'm gonna call the giant hoax.
[01:08:33.599 --> 01:08:34.999]  Stay with us for that.
[01:08:34.999 --> 01:08:37.140]  I really appreciate Greg Pallast.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.601]  He's worked for ABC News, BBC, you name it.
[01:08:39.601 --> 01:08:41.961]  Syndicated columnist.
[01:08:41.961 --> 01:08:45.382]  Joining us, he also writes for The Observer, one of the biggest newspapers in Europe.
[01:08:45.382 --> 01:08:47.103]  GregPallast.com is his site.
[01:08:47.103 --> 01:08:48.763]  He's a best-selling author.
[01:08:48.763 --> 01:08:55.986]  I wanted to get him on because he explained in 2002 when the documents leaked that there's a plan to implode Europe and the U.S.
[01:08:55.986 --> 01:08:57.066]  with the hedge funds next.
[01:08:58.416 --> 01:09:00.358]  And sign us onto their derivatives debt.
[01:09:00.358 --> 01:09:04.984]  And he decried the derivatives moves in the late 1990s as well, bipartisanly.
[01:09:04.984 --> 01:09:09.729]  He was a former federal fraud investigation specialist at the highest levels of...
[01:09:10.799 --> 01:09:12.700]  These brokerage firms and big banks.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:13.701]  So he saw it coming.
[01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:21.325]  He's the first guy, other than economist George Humphrey, my friend here in Austin, City Council member at the time, who also broke it down.
[01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:23.506]  But Greg Powell's got the documents.
[01:09:23.506 --> 01:09:25.767]  What they've done to the third world, they plan to do here.
[01:09:25.767 --> 01:09:28.808]  What they've done to Greece, they're going to do to every other country in Europe, and then us.
[01:09:28.808 --> 01:09:32.550]  Whatever they can get away with, they'll do.
[01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:35.632]  And now they say they want 10% of the Cyprus Bank's money.
[01:09:35.632 --> 01:09:36.833]  And now they're saying 15% in Italy and 15% in Spain.
[01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:45.354]  To set the precedent to just steal your money right off the top, unelected EU bureaucrats.
[01:09:45.354 --> 01:09:49.736]  So, I wanted to get him on here today.
[01:09:49.736 --> 01:09:51.657]  They put an arrest warrant out a few years ago for him.
[01:09:51.657 --> 01:09:55.318]  He was covering the FEMA trailer areas in Louisiana falling apart.
[01:09:55.318 --> 01:09:58.340]  They said it was terrorism to film a government installation.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.600]  The arrest warrant was issued.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.702]  It got media coverage, and so they didn't arrest him.
[01:10:02.702 --> 01:10:04.543]  It got dropped, but it shows the mindset.
[01:10:05.203 --> 01:10:10.246]  Of this system, where we can't hand out magazines now in Austin, until I went down there and threatened to sue.
[01:10:10.246 --> 01:10:12.908]  They said, you can't hand your magazines out anywhere in this downtown.
[01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.869]  You can't have InfoWars bumper stickers.
[01:10:14.869 --> 01:10:16.971]  It shows what the higher-ups want.
[01:10:16.971 --> 01:10:19.572]  And if we lay down, they're going to win.
[01:10:19.572 --> 01:10:23.675]  The fake instinct to grovel and lick boots is going to bring us to hell.
[01:10:23.675 --> 01:10:33.421]  Now, Greg Palast of gregpalast.com, I want to get your take on exactly what's happening, where this is moving, and where the future of this is going to go.
[01:10:33.421 --> 01:10:34.242]  Greg, thanks for joining us.
[01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:36.866]  You're very welcome, Alex.
[01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:52.982]  I'm really glad to be back with you, especially because when I wrote in Vice Magazine, a giant international column of space that I have, that the Alex Jones Show is one of the most intelligent
[01:10:53.772 --> 01:10:58.255]  Most informative platforms for real journalism in the United States.
[01:10:58.255 --> 01:11:01.157]  A lot of my lefty friends are like, what are you talking about?
[01:11:01.157 --> 01:11:02.117]  Alex Jones!
[01:11:02.117 --> 01:11:09.142]  And I said, yes, listen with your mind open and you will get information you won't hear anywhere else.
[01:11:09.142 --> 01:11:10.983]  I don't have to agree with everything you say, Alex.
[01:11:10.983 --> 01:11:12.944]  It doesn't matter.
[01:11:12.944 --> 01:11:14.385]  What a blessing to have this platform.
[01:11:14.385 --> 01:11:15.366]  So I appreciate being on it.
[01:11:15.586 --> 01:11:24.798]  I appreciate you, but I mean, listen, they do that to anybody that gets off the controlled left-right establishment fake debate plantation because they're scared.
[01:11:24.798 --> 01:11:34.610]  Anybody who's starting to really have an effect like yourself or others, they will attack that person in the press and say, don't go near this person because they're afraid our ideas are going to be picked up.
[01:11:35.282 --> 01:11:41.526]  In fact, I just have to take a couple seconds to mention that obviously I am the mainstream outside the United States.
[01:11:41.526 --> 01:11:44.268]  The BBC, the biggest English language television network.
[01:11:44.268 --> 01:11:45.549]  Let's talk about Piers Morgan briefly.
[01:11:45.549 --> 01:11:49.711]  Yeah, because what happened was... Five of his employees are arrested now.
[01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:51.433]  I mean, you know, when is he going to get arrested?
[01:11:51.433 --> 01:11:51.713]  Go ahead.
[01:11:52.578 --> 01:11:58.926]  Well, as soon as he steps back in England, this is amazing to me, and I have to say, bless you, sir, for getting in his face.
[01:11:58.926 --> 01:12:08.878]  Piers Morgan, as a BBC television reporter, and as a reporter for The Guardian, the biggest English language paper in the nation, much bigger than The New York Times,
[01:12:09.778 --> 01:12:22.528]  I did an undercover investigation in which I found that there was a lockup between Tony Blair, the Clinton White House, big power companies to basically seize the utility assets of the planet.
[01:12:22.528 --> 01:12:30.215]  And I uncovered this, including Enron, got inside, did undercover reporting, splashed all over, almost brought down the Blair government.
[01:12:30.215 --> 01:12:31.596]  People went to prison.
[01:12:31.596 --> 01:12:35.399]  But Piers Morgan, who was running a filth rag called the Mirror,
[01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:40.390]  Uh, went after me, calling me a liar, coming and smearing me.
[01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:41.471]  He puts you on the cover.
[01:12:41.471 --> 01:12:43.032]  And listen, you never took your horn.
[01:12:43.032 --> 01:12:51.021]  You more than anybody helped bring down Enron, God bless you, who was raping the Californians, what, some weeks of over a billion dollars in extra charges?
[01:12:51.021 --> 01:12:51.542]  That's right.
[01:12:51.542 --> 01:12:56.628]  And what I always hated is that while we got Enron, I thought that it wasn't a bad apple, it was a whole damn rotten tree.
[01:12:57.048 --> 01:12:58.349]  Yeah.
[01:12:58.349 --> 01:13:09.316]  And so what happened was that Piers Morgan even went so far as to, as you know, I was on the cover as a sex maniac of the, of the mirror, just making up this stuff about Greg, you know.
[01:13:09.316 --> 01:13:16.640]  Hey, listen, I don't mind a little action, but you know, they, I was smeared left and right by Piers Morgan, a complete liar.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.863]  And then I... Well, a sex maniac's better than a hacker, hacking innocent people.
[01:13:21.603 --> 01:13:23.625]  You know, maniac maybe.
[01:13:23.625 --> 01:13:34.055]  But the thing is, we also uncovered that Piers Morgan had done insider trading, stuff that in the United States, you'd be breaking rocks on a chain game.
[01:13:34.055 --> 01:13:35.956]  He would trade on stocks.
[01:13:35.956 --> 01:13:36.757]  Listen to this.
[01:13:36.757 --> 01:13:38.379]  This guy would trade, Piers Morgan.
[01:13:39.039 --> 01:13:50.743]  Would, as the editor of the paper, find out what his columnists were going to recommend in the business pages the next day or next week to buy, he would buy it in advance, knowing that the stock would be pumped and would go up.
[01:13:50.743 --> 01:13:51.723]  It was automatic.
[01:13:51.723 --> 01:13:55.984]  He was pocketing hundreds of thousands of pounds in his own pocket.
[01:13:55.984 --> 01:14:01.086]  You know, in the U.S., I mean, that's absolute jail time.
[01:14:01.086 --> 01:14:02.706]  I've never heard of anyone doing that in U.S.
[01:14:02.706 --> 01:14:03.367]  jail time.
[01:14:03.367 --> 01:14:04.347]  They let him get away with it.
[01:14:04.767 --> 01:14:06.628]  He lied on his visas.
[01:14:06.628 --> 01:14:07.649]  The U.S.
[01:14:07.649 --> 01:14:26.282]  State Department, including the current Obama administration, allowed him to come into the United States, despite the fact that it says that if you committed what would be a felony crime in the United States, which he committed, you committed a felony crime in the United States, then you can't get a visa to work here.
[01:14:26.282 --> 01:14:27.143]  You can't get a green card.
[01:14:27.143 --> 01:14:29.324]  Doesn't he fit the perfect M.O.
[01:14:29.324 --> 01:14:29.985]  of probably M.I.
[01:14:29.985 --> 01:14:30.345]  5 or M.I. 6?
[01:14:32.771 --> 01:14:35.735]  Worse, because he uses their information.
[01:14:35.735 --> 01:14:37.036]  In other words, he's got a lot of inside info.
[01:14:37.036 --> 01:14:38.878]  By the way, I do know that he really doesn't like you, Alex.
[01:14:52.037 --> 01:14:53.118]  I got the inside.
[01:14:53.118 --> 01:14:53.999]  Really, what did they say?
[01:14:53.999 --> 01:14:59.023]  I'll tell you later, but they're really not happy with either of us.
[01:14:59.023 --> 01:15:03.947]  But the thing is, they're really upset with me because I'm from his establishment, from BBT.
[01:15:03.947 --> 01:15:08.992]  And the other thing he did was he fabricated reports on the war in Iraq.
[01:15:08.992 --> 01:15:12.395]  He literally took fabricated photos and he got caught.
[01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:15.456]  Supposedly, photos of soldiers in Iraq.
[01:15:15.456 --> 01:15:18.518]  They were taken in sunny England.
[01:15:18.518 --> 01:15:20.739]  And he faked these photos.
[01:15:20.739 --> 01:15:23.661]  And when he got caught, he said, well, they were kind of like the real thing.
[01:15:23.661 --> 01:15:25.141]  Can you imagine?
[01:15:25.141 --> 01:15:27.062]  Faking war photos?
[01:15:27.062 --> 01:15:27.743]  I gotta hear them.
[01:15:27.743 --> 01:15:28.543]  And I know they hate me.
[01:15:28.543 --> 01:15:30.064]  They were crying and freaking out.
[01:15:30.064 --> 01:15:31.325]  They say they beat me in the debate.
[01:15:31.325 --> 01:15:32.665]  It was actually blew up in their face.
[01:15:32.665 --> 01:15:33.125]  They're scared.
[01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:37.988]  But before we get into Cyprus, but I mean, this hatchet man thing is important.
[01:15:37.988 --> 01:15:39.629]  What from your sources is Morgan saying?
[01:15:40.794 --> 01:15:42.395]  Okay, he's just really upset with you.
[01:15:42.395 --> 01:15:44.336]  I mean, he's reading everything we're saying about him.
[01:15:44.336 --> 01:15:45.117]  Hi, Pierce!
[01:15:45.117 --> 01:15:47.739]  I'm sure he's monitoring.
[01:15:47.739 --> 01:15:54.063]  And, you know, he's tried so hard to set me up to ruin my career, to say, you know, I'm a sex maniac.
[01:15:54.063 --> 01:16:00.007]  And hey, listen, here's my phone number if anyone wants to help me get over this terrible affliction.
[01:16:01.928 --> 01:16:02.348]  I don't
[01:16:19.218 --> 01:16:19.538]  I don't
[01:16:36.187 --> 01:16:40.751]  Mainstream media needs a new TV host, a new news anchor.
[01:16:40.751 --> 01:16:44.115]  They just wait for a toilet to overflow, and they got him!
[01:16:44.115 --> 01:16:45.916]  You know, and it's just unbelievable.
[01:16:45.916 --> 01:16:48.178]  Is that the best America could find?
[01:16:48.178 --> 01:16:56.767]  Is this guy who, if he goes back to England, will be immediately clamped in irons, by the way, because he was involved in wiretapping phones.
[01:16:57.267 --> 01:16:58.907]  That's all against the campfire attack.
[01:16:58.907 --> 01:17:00.968]  Well, they've already arrested, what is it, like 10 people?
[01:17:00.968 --> 01:17:02.328]  It was five more last week.
[01:17:02.328 --> 01:17:03.568]  His underlings?
[01:17:03.568 --> 01:17:04.068]  You know what?
[01:17:04.068 --> 01:17:05.929]  All the people around him.
[01:17:05.929 --> 01:17:07.629]  All the people around him.
[01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:18.071]  And he even admits that he heard, he listened in on private phone conversations because they hacked into people's answering machine, including Sir Paul McCartney.
[01:17:18.071 --> 01:17:19.191]  I know exactly how he did it.
[01:17:19.191 --> 01:17:22.472]  I'm not going to, I can't reveal, but I know exactly the method he used.
[01:17:23.292 --> 01:17:25.293]  Um, from my BBC television show.
[01:17:25.293 --> 01:17:27.754]  Our investigators know exactly how you did it, Pierce.
[01:17:27.754 --> 01:17:29.335]  I know exactly.
[01:17:29.335 --> 01:17:34.237]  And we will reveal that as soon as you get close enough to your, to sunny England.
[01:17:35.137 --> 01:17:35.898]  To be arrested.
[01:17:35.898 --> 01:17:37.979]  Then we'll reveal it.
[01:17:37.979 --> 01:17:39.160]  We know how you did it.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:39.760]  He's listening.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.141]  It's creepy.
[01:17:41.141 --> 01:17:42.282]  You know, it's creepy.
[01:17:42.282 --> 01:17:43.522]  It's illegal, by the way.
[01:17:43.522 --> 01:17:45.003]  It's quite illegal.
[01:17:45.003 --> 01:17:49.426]  You know, he jumped whenever I found out he was at a big gun place in Houston, they told me.
[01:17:49.426 --> 01:17:54.169]  So they let me into the green room and I walked up and he actually jumped when he saw me.
[01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.910]  It was really funny.
[01:17:56.408 --> 01:18:04.751]  You know, these guys, you know, it's, and so it's, it's unfortunately, unfortunately, suddenly he's clothing himself as a guy protecting our little children from getting shot in schools.
[01:18:04.751 --> 01:18:05.952]  Police!
[01:18:05.952 --> 01:18:08.733]  This guy is, he's a threat to the moral character.
[01:18:08.733 --> 01:18:10.393]  Oh yeah, that's like the Bushes.
[01:18:10.393 --> 01:18:20.897]  Prescott Bush, after he got caught running the Nazi banks, they created the USO, right as he was about to be arrested with all the others, but they did that, so they said, well we can't arrest him, he just started this thing for the troops.
[01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:21.918]  Yeah, so you gotta look.
[01:18:22.688 --> 01:18:35.918]  It's fun and circus, and what's terrible about it is that somehow they say Alex Jones is a wild man, and yet Piers Morgan, who does nothing but the Britney Spears, he says his dream interview would be Britney Spears.
[01:18:35.918 --> 01:18:37.379]  Excuse me, I want to vomit.
[01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:38.980]  But anyway, I don't mind.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.241]  You want to interview Britney Spears?
[01:18:40.241 --> 01:18:41.202]  Fine, Mr. Morgan.
[01:18:41.202 --> 01:18:44.605]  Just do it from the prison cell that's waiting for you in London.
[01:18:44.605 --> 01:18:46.426]  And it's getting a lot closer.
[01:18:46.426 --> 01:18:51.270]  I mean, how can all his underlings go to jail and admit they've been doing this, but he doesn't get in trouble?
[01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.450]  Yeah.
[01:18:51.892 --> 01:18:54.413]  I mean, the English system is so class-poisoned.
[01:18:54.413 --> 01:18:59.994]  And plus, don't forget, Alex, remember I said he lined his pockets from inside information.
[01:18:59.994 --> 01:19:10.476]  I want to know, Mr. Morgan, who else, who in government, who in MI6, who in the establishment, did you also pass off these tips to?
[01:19:10.476 --> 01:19:13.257]  Who else traded on this inside information with you?
[01:19:13.257 --> 01:19:14.917]  And is that why you've been protected?
[01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.138]  Well, we know it's come out the Metropolitan Police were in it.
[01:19:18.646 --> 01:19:19.206]  We know that.
[01:19:19.206 --> 01:19:21.208]  I mean, straight up bribery to the police.
[01:19:21.208 --> 01:19:22.829]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[01:19:22.829 --> 01:19:26.271]  But anyway, let's, you know, but I think... Yeah, we're going to break.
[01:19:26.271 --> 01:19:27.192]  Take us out to break.
[01:19:27.192 --> 01:19:27.572]  30 seconds.
[01:19:27.572 --> 01:19:29.794]  What's going on in Cyprus with the bank accounts disappearing?
[01:19:31.113 --> 01:19:36.878]  Uh, wholesale thievery, but what they're doing in Cyprus, they're doing in New York too, but in a much subtler way.
[01:19:36.878 --> 01:19:40.321]  Much subtler, but it's just as evil, just as bad.
[01:19:40.321 --> 01:19:43.824]  There's no way, believe me, and I have the documents.
[01:19:43.824 --> 01:19:44.845]  I know you always do.
[01:19:44.845 --> 01:19:46.586]  We're going to come back with Greg Palast.
[01:19:46.586 --> 01:19:54.953]  We'll keep him to about 40 after, then I'll make my big announcement because we need to finish up on this, but a big story about to go up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:19:54.953 --> 01:19:55.334]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.854 --> 01:20:02.775]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:20:49.716 --> 01:20:51.837]  Sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:07.015]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.015 --> 01:22:15.142]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.142 --> 01:22:22.968]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:23.288 --> 01:22:28.391]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.391 --> 01:22:33.614]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.614 --> 01:22:37.956]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:37.956 --> 01:22:39.036]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.036 --> 01:22:43.539]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:43.539 --> 01:22:48.441]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:48.441 --> 01:22:50.963]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:22:56.768 --> 01:22:59.812]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.812 --> 01:23:02.194]  You've heard about our MRE Smorgasbord.
[01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:10.102]  Now, Long Life Food Depot introduces the most unique, safe, and longest lasting way to stash emergency food, the EatPod.
[01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:16.905]  Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps, low moisture, and low oxygen.
[01:23:16.905 --> 01:23:19.306]  If you're storing in a basement, too humid.
[01:23:19.306 --> 01:23:21.346]  Garages and attics, too hot.
[01:23:21.346 --> 01:23:37.673]  But the waterproof, double-walled, high-density polyethylene patent-pending EatPod is a unique roll-away food bunker that creates the perfect conditions, can be buried up to 30 feet, and can keep your survival food supply safe, secure, dry, and virtually undetectable.
[01:23:37.793 --> 01:23:44.655]  For 25 years or more, get full details on the Eatpod at eatpod.com spelled E-A-T-P-O-D dot com or call 800-601-2833.
[01:23:44.655 --> 01:23:44.975]  That's 800-601-2833.
[01:23:44.975 --> 01:23:46.756]  The Eatpod from Long Life Food Depot.
[01:23:46.756 --> 01:23:48.396]  Since 1983, sending real food to your real future.
[01:24:07.158 --> 01:24:11.501]  Coming up in about 40 after.
[01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:19.187]  It's hard to turn this down, crank it up.
[01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:22.389]  When Sheriff John Brown came.
[01:24:22.389 --> 01:24:23.510]  Saw a shot.
[01:24:38.331 --> 01:24:48.938]  I shot the sheriff.
[01:24:48.938 --> 01:24:53.261]  That's right.
[01:24:53.261 --> 01:24:54.121]  Welcome back.
[01:24:54.121 --> 01:24:56.182]  Greg Palast is our guest with Breaking Analysis.
[01:24:56.182 --> 01:25:00.165]  Total insider when it comes to understanding the banking fraud and what's happening.
[01:25:00.165 --> 01:25:01.246]  I want to look at Tsipras.
[01:25:02.546 --> 01:25:04.207]  The Cypriot people of Cyprus.
[01:25:04.207 --> 01:25:08.929]  I want to look at the global financial meltdown that's impossible to stop.
[01:25:08.929 --> 01:25:11.370]  They designed it to take over the whole planet.
[01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:12.770]  And then look at the fraud going on.
[01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:14.491]  I'm going to guess he's talking about flash trading.
[01:25:14.491 --> 01:25:17.132]  And why did JP Morgan chase for two and a half hours?
[01:25:17.132 --> 01:25:19.593]  Zero account balance, everybody.
[01:25:19.593 --> 01:25:20.753]  Which a glitch can't do, folks.
[01:25:20.753 --> 01:25:22.634]  That stuff's all compartmentalized.
[01:25:22.634 --> 01:25:23.594]  There's backup systems.
[01:25:23.594 --> 01:25:26.295]  We'll get Greg's take on that if I'm wrong or right.
[01:25:26.295 --> 01:25:27.476]  Greg Palast, please continue.
[01:25:28.604 --> 01:25:41.107]  Okay, first of all, people should know that, if you don't know Greg Pallast, I'm a reporter for BBC Television, but before I became a journalist, I was an investigator, Justice Department, and racketeering fraud expert.
[01:25:41.107 --> 01:25:47.909]  But I actually got my degree in economics, studying under Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago, of all things.
[01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:50.610]  So you went to school around the real elite of this whole system?
[01:25:51.275 --> 01:25:54.458]  I was the only American in what is known as the Chicago Boys group.
[01:25:54.458 --> 01:26:02.965]  I was in with these, I studied under six Nobel Prize winners, and one of them, by the way, is a guy named Bob Mundell.
[01:26:02.965 --> 01:26:05.627]  He is known as the father of the euro.
[01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:06.948]  He invented the Europa.
[01:26:06.948 --> 01:26:10.551]  Now, the euro, as he originally called it, the euro was not
[01:26:11.254 --> 01:26:12.935]  It was not invented by Europeans.
[01:26:12.935 --> 01:26:18.276]  It was not meant to be a competitive currency to the dollar.
[01:26:18.276 --> 01:26:24.759]  What it was meant, instead, was to be something which would, and let me tell you, I'm quoting Mundell.
[01:26:24.759 --> 01:26:26.059]  I'm quoting the father of the Euro.
[01:26:26.059 --> 01:26:26.939]  No, he's on record.
[01:26:26.939 --> 01:26:29.460]  He said it was to take over countries.
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:37.023]  It was meant to eliminate the power of elected Congresses and Parliaments to regulate industry.
[01:26:37.023 --> 01:26:37.943]  It would smash
[01:26:38.563 --> 01:26:41.646]  Uh, you know, it would smash the, uh, the powerful unions.
[01:26:41.646 --> 01:26:45.670]  It would end any type of, of environmental regulation.
[01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:50.895]  And it now appoints the presidents of major countries and exempts itself from the laws.
[01:26:50.895 --> 01:26:52.156]  It is a tyranny.
[01:26:52.156 --> 01:26:57.561]  So what he said was, is, look, we have to take, and he told me this, I haven't, by the way, even tape recorded some of our conversations.
[01:26:58.241 --> 01:26:59.082]  That's what I used to do.
[01:26:59.082 --> 01:27:01.423]  I was always undercover even then as a young guy.
[01:27:01.423 --> 01:27:09.008]  He said, look, we have to take away the power of parliaments to set fiscal policy, to set monetary policy.
[01:27:09.008 --> 01:27:16.673]  If we do that and we impose this regime, then there is no vote of any parliament that could have any effect whatsoever.
[01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:19.310]  Uh, on controlling industry.
[01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:31.838]  Um, and therefore, the only thing you can do is reduce wages, cut regulations, and, and, and I don't mean regulations like, you know, that, that regulator, Civil Liberties, he's talking about cutting regulations then.
[01:27:31.838 --> 01:27:38.201]  And here's the issue, they sell it like the corporations would create a utopia, but the truth is they just shut down their competition.
[01:27:38.201 --> 01:27:44.225]  They, they are the opposite of free market while blaming the, now the free market's being blamed for their piratical looting.
[01:27:44.761 --> 01:28:03.412]  Right, so it's piracy and so what's happening is in Cyprus is that you have a bunch of billions and billions of dollars in Russian mobster money and looted money, bribery money, hot money has gone out of Russia and put into Cyprus which was made part of the Eurozone.
[01:28:03.412 --> 01:28:07.935]  This money then is basically just a money laundering island.
[01:28:07.935 --> 01:28:14.279]  The money went from Cyprus out into Greece and other places so the mobster money can make it then jump over to
[01:28:14.779 --> 01:28:19.244]  So let me guess, so now the top gangsters know there's smaller gangsters there as well.
[01:28:19.244 --> 01:28:22.327]  This is just Don Carleone demanding a cut right off the top.
[01:28:22.327 --> 01:28:26.872]  And while he's at it, take everything from maids and people and school teachers.
[01:28:26.872 --> 01:28:35.400]  So what happened is that the Cypriot banks, the little elite that was handling the hot Russian dirty money,
[01:28:36.101 --> 01:28:40.666]  Of course, got their skim and they gambled it all away in Greece.
[01:28:40.666 --> 01:28:45.150]  And then bigger sharks, particularly a guy named Paul Singer.
[01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:46.552]  We need to know who these guys are.
[01:28:46.552 --> 01:28:48.294]  They're not just sharks in general.
[01:28:48.294 --> 01:28:49.114]  They have names.
[01:28:49.114 --> 01:28:53.499]  Paul Singer, multi-billionaire, Romney's biggest backer, by the way, and his business partner.
[01:28:53.499 --> 01:28:56.342]  Romney's business partner has a fund called Elliott Management.
[01:28:56.342 --> 01:28:57.923]  Elliott Management went to Greece and said,
[01:28:58.824 --> 01:29:03.127]  We're going to burn this country down unless you pay us 100 times.
[01:29:03.127 --> 01:29:03.988]  I want to repeat that.
[01:29:03.988 --> 01:29:07.330]  100 times that we paid for Greek bonds.
[01:29:07.330 --> 01:29:11.874]  The Greek government paid, had to steal it from the Cypriot bankers.
[01:29:11.874 --> 01:29:14.115]  Now the Cypriot bankers are busted.
[01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:15.897]  They're about to go under.
[01:29:15.897 --> 01:29:21.101]  So the European Union holds secret meetings with the IMF.
[01:29:21.781 --> 01:29:28.563]  With the president of Cyprus, Greek Cyprus, locked in a hotel room on the fifth floor of a hotel.
[01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:30.664]  I kid you not, I can't make this stuff up.
[01:29:30.664 --> 01:29:35.305]  Locked in the fifth floor of a hotel room and told, we're going to tell you what you're going to sign off on.
[01:29:35.305 --> 01:29:38.906]  And you're going to sign off on sucking money out of the adversary.
[01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:39.866]  Stay there, let's get into this.
[01:29:39.866 --> 01:29:40.827]  This is so incredible.
[01:29:40.827 --> 01:29:42.727]  Remember, they're not just taking other gangsters' money.
[01:29:42.727 --> 01:29:47.589]  They're taking school teachers, retired cops, auto mechanics, just taking their money.
[01:29:47.589 --> 01:29:48.789]  And our media says it's good.
[01:29:50.305 --> 01:29:54.231]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.231 --> 01:29:56.914]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.314 --> 01:30:04.716]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:30:04.716 --> 01:30:10.780]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[01:32:05.089 --> 01:32:06.350]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:10.212]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:10.212 --> 01:32:12.674]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:12.674 --> 01:32:18.378]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:18.378 --> 01:32:25.062]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.

[01:33:04.648 --> 01:33:06.529]  We are on the march.
[01:33:06.529 --> 01:33:09.672]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:09.672 --> 01:33:14.775]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:14.775 --> 01:33:22.701]  Let me just publicly invite Greg Palast on tonight, tomorrow, whenever he has time, to do an hour commercial-free interview.
[01:33:22.701 --> 01:33:26.164]  I mean, the commercial's on the front and the end, but you know, commercial-free, uninterrupted.
[01:33:26.764 --> 01:33:31.587]  Hour-long talk where he really has the floor and more time to break down all the names.
[01:33:31.587 --> 01:33:33.188]  He can even send us documents, articles.
[01:33:33.188 --> 01:33:41.854]  We can do a report with him to really break down the entire world and what's going on because I'm not hissing his hind end.
[01:33:41.854 --> 01:33:53.062]  When it comes to financial news and the inside scoops, this guy's worked, you know, still ABC Nightly News, Nightline, BBC Newsnight, their top show, London Guardian, Observer.
[01:33:53.062 --> 01:33:56.264]  I mean, he knows where the bodies are buried and he doesn't just say this stuff.
[01:33:56.924 --> 01:33:59.786]  He doesn't just get up here and throw this stuff out there.
[01:33:59.786 --> 01:34:00.726]  And he's non-partisan.
[01:34:00.726 --> 01:34:02.987]  He just calls it like it is.
[01:34:02.987 --> 01:34:07.790]  And I briefly want to ask him before he gets back into Cyprus and all the rest of it.
[01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:10.251]  Hugo Chavez, I know you've met him, interviewed him, know him.
[01:34:10.251 --> 01:34:16.615]  I get the fact that as strongmen go, he wasn't like, you know, super nasty like Fidel Castro or something.
[01:34:16.615 --> 01:34:19.396]  I get compared to a Hitler, he was an angel.
[01:34:19.396 --> 01:34:20.917]  And I know being close to somebody,
[01:34:21.437 --> 01:34:28.380]  You know, when the devil's got his arm around you, you don't recognize it's the devil, to quote Albert Speer, you know, the German armaments minister.
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:42.846]  But I understand the globalists are horrible and evil and are much more sophisticated, but I know people from there who, you know, the communists basically, he says he wasn't a communist, I say he was a socialist, taking property, you know, taking small family businesses.
[01:34:42.846 --> 01:34:45.327]  I mean, obviously he had a dark side too.
[01:34:45.327 --> 01:34:48.869]  Your eulogy or your statement on Hugo Chavez briefly.
[01:34:50.481 --> 01:34:53.787]  Okay, I knew Hugo Chavez very well for more than a decade.
[01:34:53.787 --> 01:34:57.473]  We met many times.
[01:34:57.473 --> 01:35:01.118]  But on the other hand, I had a lot of disagreements with him and I got in his face quite a bit.
[01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:07.732]  One thing I don't like to do is become friends with any politician because that's dangerous stuff.
[01:35:07.732 --> 01:35:11.132]  I'm not Brian Williams having dinner with the president.
[01:35:11.132 --> 01:35:12.873]  That makes me vomit.
[01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:14.433]  So I'm not going to do that with Chavez.
[01:35:14.433 --> 01:35:21.895]  But what you have to understand with Chavez, he was an elected leader, unlike Castro, who's a dictator who rules purely by the gun.
[01:35:24.756 --> 01:35:26.758]  You know, Chavez was elected.
[01:35:26.758 --> 01:35:30.460]  But Chavez is cozying up to him was I mean, I think that's what I mean.
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:31.101]  I mean, I wasn't.
[01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:35.644]  The thing is, is that the important thing is that he stood up against new global order.
[01:35:36.192 --> 01:35:39.574]  He said, you're not going to take our oil for nothing.
[01:35:39.574 --> 01:35:42.536]  He's not going to give away the oil to the Koch Brothers for nothing.
[01:35:42.536 --> 01:35:49.180]  By the way, the Koch Brothers are his main customers at the Flint Hills Refinery in Houston, outside Corpus Christi.
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:51.702]  He wasn't going to give the Koch Brothers free oil.
[01:35:51.702 --> 01:36:00.007]  He wasn't going to give away all the money that comes down for oil that used to go to Miami, that was skimmed by the rich.
[01:36:00.007 --> 01:36:02.368]  So he basically said, he was Robin Hood.
[01:36:02.368 --> 01:36:03.869]  He was Robin, like FDR.
[01:36:03.869 --> 01:36:04.190]  He said,
[01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:09.314]  I'm going to take from the rich, who've run this country forever, and I'm going to give it to the poor.
[01:36:09.314 --> 01:36:11.235]  They've never gotten the oil money, now they'll get it.
[01:36:11.235 --> 01:36:12.937]  When I went to Caracas in 1976, the first oil boom...
[01:36:16.257 --> 01:36:19.359]  Poor people, a million people lived in cardboard shacks.
[01:36:19.359 --> 01:36:21.680]  Those cardboard shacks aren't there anymore.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.282]  Chavez replaced it with bricks and mortars and buildings.
[01:36:25.282 --> 01:36:28.444]  Education, health care, you know?
[01:36:28.444 --> 01:36:35.749]  Joe, you could say when it comes to redistribution, which has always been a disaster, he is one of the only cases where it wasn't an absolute nightmare.
[01:36:37.284 --> 01:36:45.153]  He was the case where he, first of all, he didn't do it with guns, and they don't have Guantanamo, they don't have Bradley Manning in prison, none of that stuff.
[01:36:45.153 --> 01:36:46.354]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:36:46.354 --> 01:36:50.238]  I just don't say he's a good guy because we're run by bad guys.
[01:36:50.238 --> 01:36:53.182]  I don't, you know, I don't just automatically say... Go ahead.
[01:36:54.485 --> 01:37:11.298]  The big thing about Chavez, and by the way, for Alex Jones listeners, my BBC film, The Assassination of Hugo Chavez, I am offering for free, if you go to gregpalast.com, you can download it for nothing, because I want people to at least get the other side of the story and meet Chavez.
[01:37:11.298 --> 01:37:13.099]  And by the way, I meet with the guys who kidnapped him!
[01:37:13.399 --> 01:37:17.402]  He was kidnapped in 2002 by the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
[01:37:17.402 --> 01:37:19.403]  Talk about a corporate takeover.
[01:37:19.403 --> 01:37:20.044]  And the U.S.
[01:37:20.044 --> 01:37:25.448]  ambassador ran down to have his picture taken with the kidnappers while they're holding elected president hostage.
[01:37:25.448 --> 01:37:27.229]  You know how that looked to the rest of Latin America?
[01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:34.835]  Well, listen, promise me this, then, when you come back next week, and we'll do a whole hour on your perspective on Hugo Chavez.
[01:37:34.835 --> 01:37:36.636]  I would love to, and it could be with your commercials.
[01:37:36.636 --> 01:37:37.897]  I find them informative, Alex.
[01:37:37.897 --> 01:37:38.818]  I don't buy your commercials.
[01:37:39.525 --> 01:37:40.786]  Oh, especially the squatty potty.
[01:37:40.786 --> 01:37:45.308]  But the point is, the point is, is that I want to get you on the news about the financial stuff.
[01:37:45.308 --> 01:37:51.150]  I want to get you on the radio back about Chavez because I want to really explore from somebody who actually was down there.
[01:37:51.150 --> 01:37:52.431]  How many times you go to Venezuela?
[01:37:53.385 --> 01:37:54.325]  Oh, at least I have to.
[01:37:54.325 --> 01:37:56.146]  I mean, I've been down to Latin America several dozen times.
[01:37:56.146 --> 01:38:01.067]  I met not only with the president of Venezuela, Chavez, but with the presidents of Ecuador, Brazil.
[01:38:01.067 --> 01:38:02.108]  You know, all of them.
[01:38:02.108 --> 01:38:03.028]  That's my job.
[01:38:03.028 --> 01:38:05.049]  But I also meet with the people who kidnapped them.
[01:38:05.049 --> 01:38:06.089]  I meet with the people who have taken them.
[01:38:06.089 --> 01:38:07.630]  We're going to have you back on about that.
[01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:17.993]  In the three minutes we've got left, or four minutes, shift back to, on record, the private bureaucracy with the bank heads meets with the Cypriot leaders in Cyprus, and they tell them this is how it's going to be.
[01:38:17.993 --> 01:38:21.294]  Ten percent out of everybody's bank account to set a new incredible
[01:38:22.315 --> 01:38:22.576]  Yes.
[01:38:22.576 --> 01:38:22.636]  Yes.
[01:38:31.383 --> 01:38:35.804]  Yes, and what happened was Christine Lagarde, who's head of the IMF, panicked.
[01:38:35.804 --> 01:38:40.505]  She said, we're going to have an international bank run if you do that.
[01:38:40.505 --> 01:38:42.925]  Why can't you take a few dollars from the bank owners?
[01:38:42.925 --> 01:38:47.266]  They're the ones that took all the hot money, blew it away, don't they?
[01:38:47.266 --> 01:38:53.047]  And she said, at least make them lose a few percentage points of their stock in these banks.
[01:38:53.047 --> 01:38:54.267]  And they said, no.
[01:38:54.267 --> 01:38:56.888]  The ECB, the Germans said, no way.
[01:38:56.888 --> 01:38:58.848]  Because who is really behind these Cypriot guys?
[01:38:59.248 --> 01:39:01.250]  It's the Germans who own the bank stock.
[01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:03.172]  So he said, we're not taking a penny loss, guys.
[01:39:03.172 --> 01:39:05.094]  We're taking it right out of the account.
[01:39:05.094 --> 01:39:11.239]  She said, you can't take it out of the accounts of the pensions of working people.
[01:39:11.239 --> 01:39:12.781]  And they said, yeah, that's what we're taking out.
[01:39:12.781 --> 01:39:17.585]  She said, make it 30% on the Russians and the rich, the ultra rich.
[01:39:17.585 --> 01:39:22.069]  And, you know, 2%, nothing on anyone with a small account.
[01:39:22.069 --> 01:39:23.010]  They wouldn't do it.
[01:39:23.010 --> 01:39:23.751]  And there's a reason.
[01:39:24.611 --> 01:39:26.054]  They want the explosion.
[01:39:26.054 --> 01:39:34.794]  When I talked to the former chief economist of the World Bank, Joe Siglitz, he and I both lectured in economics at London School of Economics.
[01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:37.552]  And that's your article that's in my book from 2002.
[01:39:37.552 --> 01:39:39.273]  You've been breaking it down before that.
[01:39:39.273 --> 01:39:40.794]  I mean, this is part of their plan.
[01:39:40.794 --> 01:39:41.575]  This all got leaked.
[01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:43.797]  They do the same plan over and over again.
[01:40:05.575 --> 01:40:08.117]  You know, I showed the documents to Stiglitz.
[01:40:08.117 --> 01:40:09.097]  I want to make it very clear.
[01:40:09.097 --> 01:40:11.219]  He never gave me the confidential documents.
[01:40:11.219 --> 01:40:12.580]  He only verified them.
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:19.904]  I said, my God, it looks like they're actually saying we want a riot so you can move in and impose these regimes.
[01:40:19.904 --> 01:40:21.265]  He said, that's exactly right.
[01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:22.006]  It's part of the deal.
[01:40:22.006 --> 01:40:22.886]  It's the IMF riot.
[01:40:22.886 --> 01:40:25.588]  It's written right into the plan, the riot.
[01:40:25.588 --> 01:40:28.270]  And so then the repression follows the riot.
[01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:29.130]  So here's my question.
[01:40:31.047 --> 01:40:39.529]  And then the stocks go down, they can buy everything, everything falls apart for six months, then they come in and pose as the saviors, bringing in total austerity.
[01:40:39.529 --> 01:40:55.194]  And by the way, one thing I did see, also, if you go to GreatPalace.com, the Cyprus, Greek Cyprus, is surrounded, surrounded by massive pools of oil and natural gas, which have been virtually untouched.
[01:40:56.141 --> 01:40:57.543]  That's what they want.
[01:40:57.543 --> 01:40:58.463]  They're going to get that.
[01:40:58.463 --> 01:41:00.986]  That's going to be the final payment.
[01:41:00.986 --> 01:41:05.030]  What are the Russians going to do with their area they control, Cyprus?
[01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:07.313]  Well, there's the northern Greek part.
[01:41:07.313 --> 01:41:16.643]  So what happened is actually to play them off, the President, the Prime Minister of Cyprus just flew to Moscow to basically offer the Russians the big oil fields offshore.
[01:41:17.708 --> 01:41:21.270]  As a way to try to maybe counter the Europeans.
[01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:22.491]  But hey, no, they've lost.
[01:41:22.491 --> 01:41:37.360]  It's going to go to the Russians, or it's going to go to the Germans, or it's going to go to... So it's just like the beginning of World War II, or a few years into it, whenever you've got Hitler and the Russians dividing Poland, they're just there carving up Cyprus.
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:38.381]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:41:38.381 --> 01:41:42.043]  What about the precedent to just come into bank accounts and scoop money out?
[01:41:43.237 --> 01:41:53.129]  Well, this is, this is incredible that you just literally, because remember the European Union also has, just like we have in the Federal Reserve, you have a guaranteed bank account, right?
[01:41:53.129 --> 01:42:00.639]  We have a 250,000, they had a 100,000 euro absolute guarantee, and the guys are supposed to guarantee the sanctity of your account.
[01:42:01.792 --> 01:42:03.573]  Are the guys who actually took the money.
[01:42:03.573 --> 01:42:04.153]  Can you imagine?
[01:42:04.153 --> 01:42:06.874]  They just go in and say, oh, 10%.
[01:42:06.874 --> 01:42:09.795]  And these are not the people that did this.
[01:42:09.795 --> 01:42:12.917]  The bankers and the bankers didn't lose a penny.
[01:42:12.917 --> 01:42:15.198]  The money was given to them.
[01:42:15.198 --> 01:42:18.019]  And so in a way, we do it in a more sophisticated manner.
[01:42:18.019 --> 01:42:23.421]  That is, Bernanke crushes down interest that you receive to zero.
[01:42:23.421 --> 01:42:25.802]  You get a quarter of 1% in your bank accounts.
[01:42:25.802 --> 01:42:27.883]  You get next nothing in your bank accounts.
[01:42:27.883 --> 01:42:30.124]  The money is lent to the banks.
[01:42:30.697 --> 01:42:32.843]  At a quarter percent by the Federal Reserve.
[01:42:32.843 --> 01:42:36.172]  And then the Federal Reserve borrows it back as Treasury bills at three percent.
[01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:43.172]  They literally handed out trillions of dollars at a quarter percent, borrowed it back at three percent.
[01:42:43.172 --> 01:42:44.613]  Well, that's a nice deal.
[01:42:44.613 --> 01:42:45.433]  Let me in on that.
[01:42:45.433 --> 01:42:47.314]  Why can't I get that deal?
[01:42:47.314 --> 01:42:50.295]  So we do it here, but in a much more subtle manner.
[01:42:50.295 --> 01:42:53.036]  There, I think they wanted to put it in people's faces.
[01:42:53.036 --> 01:42:56.678]  They wanted to say, they wanted to push that riot.
[01:42:56.678 --> 01:42:58.919]  They want to kick the system over.
[01:42:58.919 --> 01:43:03.941]  They call it, the guys I worked with at Chicago came up with this system.
[01:43:03.941 --> 01:43:07.062]  There was a professor there, a philosopher named Joseph Schumpeter.
[01:43:07.782 --> 01:43:11.565]  And he believed in what they call creative destruction.
[01:43:11.565 --> 01:43:12.505]  It's kind of apocalyptic.
[01:43:12.505 --> 01:43:17.409]  In other words, if you bring the whole order down, you can recreate a brand new, fresh order.
[01:43:39.384 --> 01:43:45.492]  Have anyone call me, and gregpalast.com, g-r-e-g-p-a-l-a-s-t, for at least a week I'm going to keep up.
[01:43:45.492 --> 01:43:50.298]  And while you're having me on talking about Chavez, you can download that BBC film for no charge.
[01:43:51.598 --> 01:43:52.559]  Thank you, Greg.
[01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:54.881]  All right.
[01:43:54.881 --> 01:43:55.602]  Thank you, sir.
[01:43:55.602 --> 01:43:56.723]  I will talk to him again soon.
[01:43:56.723 --> 01:43:57.824]  Very important information.
[01:43:57.824 --> 01:44:01.387]  Very interesting perspective on all of this.
[01:44:01.387 --> 01:44:04.510]  And I'll debate him a little bit in a friendly way about Chavez next week.
[01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:07.893]  He started out just nationalizing the oil.
[01:44:08.453 --> 01:44:13.897]  And I can go, well, that's pretty dangerous because we know what it leads to next, but okay, I don't care about the globalists.
[01:44:13.897 --> 01:44:14.658]  You take the oil.
[01:44:14.658 --> 01:44:15.558]  And he did divvy it up.
[01:44:15.558 --> 01:44:19.081]  He built the power of the state, did give some money to some peasants, gave them some land.
[01:44:19.081 --> 01:44:21.743]  And like 14 years ago, I'm like, well, that's actually positive.
[01:44:21.743 --> 01:44:24.785]  A communist actually redistributing something?
[01:44:24.785 --> 01:44:26.646]  Because they usually don't do that because they want total control.
[01:44:26.646 --> 01:44:29.548]  They actually make things poorer, kind of agenda 21.
[01:44:29.548 --> 01:44:30.709]  But I still said I don't endorse it.
[01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:31.250]  It's going to go bad.
[01:44:32.549 --> 01:44:45.318]  And it got down to taking people's little shoe factories that might make, you know, 10,000 pairs of shoes a year, some little bitty, you know, factory with 20 employees, nationalize that, give it to the communists, kick everybody out, take small schools over.
[01:44:45.318 --> 01:44:46.259]  I mean, that's on record.
[01:44:46.259 --> 01:44:48.481]  So see, it doesn't work is the point.
[01:44:48.481 --> 01:44:51.643]  It got to where he was having to take everything.
[01:44:51.643 --> 01:44:55.586]  He was redistributing wealth of people that would be considered poor in this country.
[01:44:55.586 --> 01:45:01.170]  And it just made a giant mass of poor people that were a little bit better off than they were 20 years ago.
[01:45:02.776 --> 01:45:12.779]  But there's more of them, just no middle class really, a tiny government elite, and a few insiders that are opulently rich, and no middle class, and just a giant group of poor people.
[01:45:12.779 --> 01:45:14.859]  Who on average did get better for them?
[01:45:14.859 --> 01:45:19.321]  That's why he can't really be voted out.
[01:45:19.321 --> 01:45:22.382]  But it was starting to get bad though, back to where it was.
[01:45:22.382 --> 01:45:27.223]  I've studied this, it started really rotting because they'd already redistributed everything and everybody was just sitting around.
[01:45:29.288 --> 01:45:36.555]  Now, I've got a lot of thoughts about what I'm about to say here, and I just want to reset for a moment.
[01:45:36.555 --> 01:45:40.859]  Let's put up on screen the article right now.
[01:45:40.859 --> 01:45:49.366]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I said that I had a big announcement here on the radio show today, and it's this.
[01:45:49.366 --> 01:45:54.151]  Obama is now the head, globally, of Al Qaeda.
[01:45:56.254 --> 01:46:02.778]  And that's not a headline that we put up there that's any form of exaggeration.
[01:46:02.778 --> 01:46:08.743]  If you have to say one man commands the forces of NATO, commands U.S.
[01:46:08.743 --> 01:46:17.348]  forces to aid Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria to engage in credible atrocities, it is Barack Obama.
[01:46:17.348 --> 01:46:23.573]  It is an absolute, total, and complete fact
[01:46:25.049 --> 01:46:44.134]  That that is going on, and no one will call it like it is, but if listeners of this show will take this article, I'm going to explain this in a moment, it's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, Obama now global head of Al-Qaeda, and if you will send it out to everyone you know on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and other radio shows,
[01:46:45.254 --> 01:46:57.706]  We can force a national debate about this, just like we've done on the two billion bullets, and the armored vehicles, and the checkpoints, and the preparations for martial law, now with multiple members of Congress calling for this, investigations starting.
[01:46:57.706 --> 01:46:59.587]  We can force this out there.
[01:46:59.587 --> 01:47:07.234]  We've already, to a certain extent, made the LA Times, New York Times, and others admit, okay, the West is running Al Qaeda, is that a good idea?
[01:47:07.234 --> 01:47:08.255]  Well, my issue is,
[01:47:09.196 --> 01:47:16.820]  I don't believe in lesser of two evils, put Al-Qaeda in to take out Assad, when Assad hasn't attacked anybody, and is about 15-20 times better than Al-Qaeda.
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:22.142]  I don't say I like him, because I don't like any dictator, but he's not attacking anybody.
[01:47:22.142 --> 01:47:26.904]  And he's not, in the past, been oppressing his people, anything like what the globalists are going to put in.
[01:47:26.904 --> 01:47:31.666]  So, they put Al-Qaeda in, and then act like, this is like the Emperor's new clothes.
[01:47:31.666 --> 01:47:34.888]  He's wearing no clothes, but none of us are supposed to admit that he's naked.
[01:47:36.195 --> 01:47:37.636]  And so we all just play along with it.
[01:47:37.636 --> 01:47:45.842]  So what I'm doing is with a shocking headline that actually reports to the level of the over-the-topness.
[01:47:45.842 --> 01:47:50.706]  And it can capture people's imagination because if you just have it in the back of the paper, okay, the U.S.
[01:47:50.706 --> 01:47:56.831]  is hating these groups, including Al-Qaeda, and so is Saudi Arabia, and so is NATO, and so is France, but it's no big deal.
[01:47:56.831 --> 01:47:58.372]  You know, Assad's a bad guy.
[01:47:58.372 --> 01:48:02.936]  We force the debate with a sensational headline because this is sensational.
[01:48:03.823 --> 01:48:15.207]  See, so many people tend to, when the government does something sensationally bad, over-the-top bad, they will not cover it.
[01:48:15.207 --> 01:48:20.589]  Or they will just bury it, or they will whitewash it because, well, you can't say the government runs Al-Qaeda when they do.
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:29.386]  And now Mohammed Karzai, their own puppet, has come out and said, the United States and NATO, run Al Qaeda and Taliban, they're staging the bombings.
[01:48:29.386 --> 01:48:30.687]  Remember that two weeks ago?
[01:48:30.687 --> 01:48:33.389]  That really pushed this out there.
[01:48:33.389 --> 01:48:35.771]  And really had a lot of people start apologizing to me.
[01:48:35.771 --> 01:48:38.153]  Well, it's not just that one point, it's thousands.
[01:48:38.153 --> 01:48:41.996]  And I'm going to go over some of them here, but here's the rest of the headline, and this is what's newsworthy.
[01:48:42.777 --> 01:48:44.998]  This is what is different and will get people thinking.
[01:48:44.998 --> 01:48:47.820]  Because it shows the absurdity of what they're doing.
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:55.383]  This is not an absurd statement in reality, because what Obama and his controllers are doing is so absurd.
[01:48:55.383 --> 01:48:56.244]  Here's the headline.
[01:48:56.244 --> 01:48:58.885]  Obama now global head of Al-Qaeda.
[01:48:58.885 --> 01:49:00.086]  Sub-headline.
[01:49:00.086 --> 01:49:02.507]  Will President order drone strike on White House?
[01:49:03.379 --> 01:49:05.582]  Will the president order a drone strike on himself?
[01:49:05.582 --> 01:49:09.167]  Now, if this breaks big, we'll try to spin it that I'm saying drone strike.
[01:49:09.167 --> 01:49:10.529]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:49:10.529 --> 01:49:12.112]  I want nothing to happen to Obama.
[01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:12.592]  I want there to be 150.
[01:49:14.358 --> 01:49:16.701]  In a prison cell, along with the rest of the globalists.
[01:49:16.701 --> 01:49:17.962]  I don't want to turn him into a martyr.
[01:49:17.962 --> 01:49:19.824]  He's just a teleprompter reading puppet.
[01:49:19.824 --> 01:49:30.876]  But, in his puppet office of an authoritarian White House now, that's admitted, saying NATO's over our military, you know, he'll shut down power plants without congressional approval.
[01:49:30.876 --> 01:49:32.417]  He's becoming dictatorial.
[01:49:32.417 --> 01:49:34.579]  He ran fast and furious to blame the Second Amendment.
[01:49:35.410 --> 01:49:42.754]  You've now got Obama saying he'll kill and he'll drone strike anybody he wants, anywhere, anytime, including U.S.
[01:49:42.754 --> 01:49:50.277]  citizens, including domestically, and that he's above the law and he'll order you tortured, he'll order you drugged for trial, whatever.
[01:49:50.277 --> 01:49:50.758]  He's God.
[01:49:51.977 --> 01:50:04.120]  While in the real world they put over 50,000 Al Qaeda in Libya and now in Syria, and we have video today of them chopping innocent people's heads off, blowing up Christian churches, and engaging in unbelievable war crimes.
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:14.622]  While everyone's told we're losing our rights because of Al Qaeda, but now they're segwaying, you notice, saying, actually it is veterans and gun owners and conservatives of the new number one threat.
[01:50:15.402 --> 01:50:19.527]  Justice Department's reporting, we're going to go after them with Homeland Security.
[01:50:19.527 --> 01:50:22.550]  So I'm calling the 10 million pound elephant in the room.
[01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:25.473]  I'm calling the Emperor Obama is butt naked.
[01:50:25.473 --> 01:50:31.560]  I'm calling it out and I'm saying, according to your doctrine, that you can just say somebody's Al Qaeda and kill them.
[01:50:32.563 --> 01:50:39.687]  If you really wanted to get Al-Qaeda, President Obama, you would shut down Al-Qaeda operations that you run.
[01:50:39.687 --> 01:50:45.951]  So if you had a computer picking targets for you and you said, get Al-Qaeda, like GoldenEye, what would that computer target?
[01:50:45.951 --> 01:50:48.193]  It would target you.
[01:50:48.193 --> 01:50:49.594]  So you are the head of Al-Qaeda.
[01:50:49.594 --> 01:50:51.495]  Obama is the head of Al-Qaeda.
[01:50:51.495 --> 01:50:52.135]  I mean, it's true.
[01:50:52.135 --> 01:50:52.756]  Call it.
[01:50:52.756 --> 01:50:53.916]  People are like, what's the big news?
[01:50:53.916 --> 01:50:54.937]  That is the big news.
[01:50:54.937 --> 01:50:56.038]  Calling it for what it is.
[01:50:56.038 --> 01:50:56.878]  The Matrix.
[01:50:56.878 --> 01:50:58.059]  Taking the red pill.
[01:50:58.059 --> 01:51:00.300]  The White House runs Al-Qaeda.
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:01.081]  They are Al-Qaeda.
[01:51:01.761 --> 01:51:05.546]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[01:51:05.546 --> 01:51:08.811]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[01:51:08.811 --> 01:51:11.614]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[01:51:11.614 --> 01:51:13.757]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[01:52:01.414 --> 01:52:03.797]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[01:52:03.797 --> 01:52:07.340]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:11.325]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes.
[01:52:11.325 --> 01:52:17.211]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV jewelry and my guns.
[01:52:17.211 --> 01:52:19.734]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[01:52:20.094 --> 01:52:27.658]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[01:52:27.658 --> 01:52:33.520]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.

[01:54:14.898 --> 01:54:16.719]  About 25 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[01:54:16.719 --> 01:54:22.522]  Then John Rappaport with now they're going to start drugging you with mind control drugs to make you tell the truth in trial.
[01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:23.643]  That's just public torture.
[01:54:23.643 --> 01:54:25.163]  That's a public fake trial.
[01:54:25.163 --> 01:54:30.026]  But they're hiding it in plain view using appeal to authority to act like it's okay.
[01:54:30.846 --> 01:54:33.189]  Oh yeah, we injected black people with syphilis.
[01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:34.210]  We're not going to get in trouble.
[01:54:34.210 --> 01:54:42.881]  Yeah, we just gave, you know, hundreds of thousands of people polio-like, you know, stuff and debilitated 40 plus thousand of them in India, but it's no big deal, back of the paper.
[01:54:42.881 --> 01:54:49.568]  See, they want to just create a normalcy bias where you just get used to incredibly bad things being normal if government does it.
[01:54:50.345 --> 01:54:52.746]  That's how the journey of tyranny happens.
[01:54:52.746 --> 01:54:57.707]  And so you read the article that Paul Watson and I put together this morning that just went up at Infowars.com.
[01:54:57.707 --> 01:54:59.828]  Obama now head of Al Qaeda.
[01:54:59.828 --> 01:55:02.769]  Will President order drone strikes on White House?
[01:55:02.769 --> 01:55:04.210]  I'm getting my movie names wrong.
[01:55:06.148 --> 01:55:20.436]  The name of the film where people can't control their own subconscious is Forbidden Planet, and it's Eagle Eye, where the computer sees that the government's destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution with drone strikes, and attacks the government.
[01:55:20.436 --> 01:55:24.358]  So we ask the question, and I'm asking it, and again, I want no arm on the President.
[01:55:24.358 --> 01:55:25.698]  They'll try to twist that and say that.
[01:55:27.099 --> 01:55:30.525]  That'll just help get the story out even more, because you're a bunch of liars if you say that.
[01:55:30.525 --> 01:55:34.071]  Secret Service has been here before, multiple times, so whatever.
[01:55:34.071 --> 01:55:37.958]  We're saying, according to Obama, saying kill anybody involved with Al Qaeda.
[01:55:38.826 --> 01:55:42.127]  Will he order a drone strike on the White House or on himself?
[01:55:42.127 --> 01:55:44.027]  Or on NATO headquarters?
[01:55:44.027 --> 01:55:56.891]  Because they run Al-Qaeda and Taliban, and Karzai's pointing it out, and I've got stacks of articles linked in this mainstream news admitting it, and the Council on Foreign Relations saying, we need Al-Qaeda, they're doing a great job.
[01:55:56.891 --> 01:55:57.911]  Said that last year.
[01:55:57.911 --> 01:55:59.512]  That's the real government here in the U.S.
[01:56:00.692 --> 01:56:13.982]  So by having a shocking headline, only a shocking headline can point out the shocking absurdity of the globalists running Al-Qaeda all over the world and then saying, oh, well, we just play both sides.
[01:56:13.982 --> 01:56:14.723]  No, you don't.
[01:56:14.723 --> 01:56:19.426]  You ran 9-11, you ran Oklahoma City, you ran Fast and Furious, you ran it all.
[01:56:19.426 --> 01:56:21.328]  Then they go, oh, you're saying our troops did.
[01:56:21.328 --> 01:56:24.470]  No, the criminal globalists that have infiltrated the government.
[01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:25.271]  That's who I'm talking about.
[01:56:25.796 --> 01:56:26.476]  Let's get that straight.
[01:56:26.476 --> 01:56:27.337]  That's the inside job.
[01:56:27.337 --> 01:56:29.238]  Does that not mean there aren't some Muslim extremists?
[01:56:29.238 --> 01:56:30.119]  Yeah, there are!
[01:56:30.119 --> 01:56:34.422]  And the globalists use them to take down countries and take my liberties.
[01:56:34.422 --> 01:56:36.903]  And I am sick and tired of it.
[01:56:36.903 --> 01:56:38.124]  Now, let me go over this here.
[01:56:38.124 --> 01:56:43.207]  Obama, now global head of Al-Qaeda, will President order drone strike on the White House?
[01:56:43.207 --> 01:56:44.448]  And I asked that question.
[01:56:44.448 --> 01:56:50.212]  Member Gibbs said, oh, we were told a lie and said there was no drone program, even though it was admitted to exist.
[01:56:50.212 --> 01:56:51.853]  This is the same deal.
[01:56:51.853 --> 01:56:53.234]  They run Al-Qaeda publicly.
[01:56:53.993 --> 01:56:57.134]  And they're trying to get us to sit here and play along with it.
[01:56:57.134 --> 01:56:59.195]  So I'm not playing along.
[01:56:59.195 --> 01:57:00.876]  Okay?
[01:57:00.876 --> 01:57:02.376]  That's why we're in so much trouble, folks.
[01:57:02.376 --> 01:57:04.157]  They have gone so far.
[01:57:04.157 --> 01:57:06.037]  No one wants to admit this.
[01:57:06.037 --> 01:57:17.942]  It came out recently in Williamson County that they knowingly kept an innocent man in jail who had no criminal record for 25 years, even though they had the bloody bandana and had somebody else who'd done a murder and tried to keep him in jail.
[01:57:17.942 --> 01:57:19.983]  And you're like, how did that happen?
[01:57:19.983 --> 01:57:23.204]  Because once they knew they'd set him up, they could never admit it.
[01:57:24.107 --> 01:57:25.333]  And it's the same thing.
[01:57:25.333 --> 01:57:26.499]  Once they get you...
[01:57:28.902 --> 01:57:30.564]  That's the Michael Morton's case.
[01:57:30.564 --> 01:57:33.947]  Once they get you into evil, you have to keep defending it.
[01:57:33.947 --> 01:57:44.135]  So now they've got us defending the government running Al-Qaeda, while saying they've got to take our rights because of Al-Qaeda, and I told you this was coming, now saying, oh it's not Al-Qaeda, it's patriots, we're the new Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:44.135 --> 01:57:44.876]  No I'm not!
[01:57:44.876 --> 01:57:49.720]  You're terrorists, you're Al-Qaeda, you're a foreign banking cartel, I want you out of here.
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.762]  And the whole world's watching this, I can't believe I'm still alive.
[01:57:52.762 --> 01:57:56.205]  Because God is on my side, and I'll be alive as long as God wants me to be alive.
[01:57:58.109 --> 01:58:00.773]  Okay, so that's what's happening, that's what's going on.
[01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:04.238]  Now, let me go over some of these headlines for you as we go to break here with a document cam.
[01:58:04.238 --> 01:58:04.598]  Look at this.
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:06.640]  Okay, backing this up.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:07.941]  Go read the article.
[01:58:07.941 --> 01:58:10.621]  It's got it all in there.
[01:58:10.621 --> 01:58:11.921]  Going over this.
[01:58:11.921 --> 01:58:13.122]  Look at this headline.
[01:58:13.122 --> 01:58:16.343]  Gruesome video shows Syrian Al-Qaeda rebel beheading civilians.
[01:58:16.343 --> 01:58:17.063]  Look at this.
[01:58:17.063 --> 01:58:20.043]  Al-Qaeda-linked Iman dined at Pentagon after 9-11.
[01:58:20.043 --> 01:58:21.204]  Anwar al-Awlaki.
[01:58:21.204 --> 01:58:21.864]  Fox News.
[01:58:21.864 --> 01:58:24.464]  Al-Qaeda leader dined at Pentagon just months after 9-11.
[01:58:24.464 --> 01:58:25.865]  Al-Qaeda specter in Syria.
[01:58:25.865 --> 01:58:26.705]  CFR.
[01:58:26.705 --> 01:58:28.185]  They're going to say we need Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:28.185 --> 01:58:29.466]  Oh, they're so great.
[01:58:29.466 --> 01:58:32.166]  CFR strategist praises Al-Qaeda bombings in Syria.
[01:58:32.166 --> 01:58:34.807]  I mean, this is what I'm... Call it for what it is!
[01:58:35.467 --> 01:58:37.449]  The globalists are Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:37.449 --> 01:58:38.430]  They run Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:41.533]  Obama is the Al-Qaeda commander.

[01:59:56.405 --> 01:59:59.187]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.799 --> 02:00:10.621]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.621 --> 02:00:12.201]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.201 --> 02:00:14.122]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.122 --> 02:00:17.943]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.943 --> 02:00:23.225]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.225 --> 02:00:27.726]  I just walked back in the reporter area with Jakari Jackson, Melissa Melton, David Knight.
[02:00:27.726 --> 02:00:28.727]  We're all back there.
[02:00:28.727 --> 02:00:30.187]  And I said, what do you think of what I just did?
[02:00:30.187 --> 02:00:32.708]  And David Knight looked at me and said, you just outed Obama.
[02:00:33.755 --> 02:00:34.336]  And that's it.
[02:00:34.336 --> 02:00:36.637]  I mean, they're hiding in plain view.
[02:00:36.637 --> 02:00:38.659]  It's like catching a guy in bed with your wife.
[02:00:38.659 --> 02:00:40.801]  I mean, just boom, a whole deal right there.
[02:00:40.801 --> 02:00:41.842]  They're like, nothing happened.
[02:00:41.842 --> 02:00:42.482]  Nothing happened.
[02:00:42.482 --> 02:00:44.604]  They're running Al-Qaeda in front of us.
[02:00:44.604 --> 02:00:47.686]  So I'm saying, hey, Mohammed Karzai is calling them out.
[02:00:47.686 --> 02:00:48.247]  Everybody is.
[02:00:48.247 --> 02:00:48.947]  Just call them out.
[02:00:48.947 --> 02:00:49.848]  You're Al-Qaeda.
[02:00:49.848 --> 02:00:51.249]  It's a bunch of foreign banks.
[02:00:51.249 --> 02:00:52.050]  Run our government.
[02:00:52.050 --> 02:00:54.171]  They're staging stuff to get our guns.
[02:00:54.171 --> 02:00:58.034]  And people groveling to them is not going to get us out of this.
[02:00:58.034 --> 02:00:59.716]  Just calling it like it is.
[02:00:59.716 --> 02:01:00.717]  I don't want my children.
[02:01:01.377 --> 02:01:03.998]  Or your children having a hellish future.
[02:01:03.998 --> 02:01:05.098]  I care about the future.
[02:01:05.098 --> 02:01:06.999]  I care about the continuum.
[02:01:06.999 --> 02:01:10.640]  We have all this wealth because our ancestors did care about the continuum.
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:15.242]  That is the most, that's a key trait of civilization, is that you're not just thinking about today.
[02:01:15.242 --> 02:01:18.223]  And you're not ego-driven, you're not peacock-driven.
[02:01:19.147 --> 02:01:26.948]  It's okay to like some nice things and fast cars or whatever for its enjoyment and its security, but it's not to worship.
[02:01:26.948 --> 02:01:28.969]  See, there will be no idols before me.
[02:01:28.969 --> 02:01:29.929]  What does that mean?
[02:01:29.929 --> 02:01:32.530]  An idol, you worship it.
[02:01:32.530 --> 02:01:34.290]  God's gotta be number one.
[02:01:34.290 --> 02:01:36.470]  Doesn't mean you don't like other things in your life.
[02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:38.451]  Doesn't mean you don't like some status or whatever.
[02:01:38.451 --> 02:01:41.211]  As you get closer to God, you won't care about that anymore.
[02:01:41.211 --> 02:01:44.932]  The point is, is that you will start turning loose of the things of the flesh.
[02:01:46.005 --> 02:01:50.669]  And I'm telling you, it's fulfilling to the point of, I will call them out, even if they kill me.
[02:01:50.669 --> 02:01:52.230]  And I'm not stupid, folks.
[02:01:52.230 --> 02:01:54.792]  I accelerate into territory very dangerous.
[02:01:54.792 --> 02:01:57.134]  Because they know, I know how to call them out.
[02:01:57.134 --> 02:02:00.357]  Because I am primitive.
[02:02:00.357 --> 02:02:09.024]  Now let's go to Lindsey Graham, walking around like a sweating degenerate, with We Are Change questioning him, going, we hung Nazis, we can hang whoever we want in America.
[02:02:09.024 --> 02:02:10.605]  The idea is, though, you're the Nazis.
[02:02:10.605 --> 02:02:12.587]  He goes, we're not the SS.
[02:02:12.587 --> 02:02:13.748]  We're moral.
[02:02:13.748 --> 02:02:15.029]  The SS thought they were moral.
[02:02:16.018 --> 02:02:20.753]  They have the diaries of the SS, how much they hated shooting little kids in the head and stuff, but it was the right thing to do.
[02:02:20.753 --> 02:02:22.258]  Here, let's go ahead and go to this tape.
[02:02:23.411 --> 02:02:28.753]  Senator Graham, why do you think Obama should be judge, jury, and executioner with his deposition matrix?
[02:02:28.753 --> 02:02:35.256]  Oh, I couldn't have... I believe that enemy combatants, American citizens, can be enemy combatants.
[02:02:35.256 --> 02:02:39.197]  What about Abdurahi Malawaki, the 16-year-old innocent American citizen?
[02:02:39.197 --> 02:02:45.199]  I don't know what the facts were, but you do get collateral damage.
[02:02:45.199 --> 02:02:49.481]  The person who determines enemy combatant status is not a court, it's the commander-in-chief.
[02:02:49.481 --> 02:02:50.361]  It's one person.
[02:02:50.361 --> 02:02:51.261]  Shouldn't there be more?
[02:02:53.123 --> 02:02:57.597]  Shouldn't it be more than one person that gets to decide who lives and dies?
[02:03:00.819 --> 02:03:05.940]  We're at war, and the Commander-in-Chief, one person sends our soldiers into battle.
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:07.700]  We don't have a Committee of Congress.
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:08.820]  What about when it's America?
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:13.061]  Just listen, I don't care if you're an American citizen or not under the law of war, that doesn't matter.
[02:03:13.061 --> 02:03:15.182]  Yeah, they say you're a terrorist, you're dead.
[02:03:15.182 --> 02:03:17.102]  You wear uniforms, so you know that, punk.
[02:03:17.102 --> 02:03:17.842]  You run Al-Qaeda.
[02:03:17.842 --> 02:03:21.263]  American citizens recruited by Al-Qaeda, they're looking in the backyard.
[02:03:21.263 --> 02:03:21.803]  You run Al-Qaeda.
[02:03:21.803 --> 02:03:22.923]  They're here already.
[02:03:22.923 --> 02:03:25.243]  Yeah, we know, you're one of them.
[02:03:25.243 --> 02:03:27.644]  That's Al-Qaeda right there.
[02:03:27.644 --> 02:03:28.684]  They're here already.
[02:03:29.464 --> 02:03:31.985]  They'll have a hearing about whether or not you're a member of the organization.
[02:03:31.985 --> 02:03:33.385]  Yeah, they're dining at the Pentagon.
[02:03:33.385 --> 02:03:36.366]  We have one person that orders our troops into battle.
[02:03:36.366 --> 02:03:40.868]  And the same person has the authority to determine who the enemy is because we're at war.
[02:03:40.868 --> 02:03:41.848]  Thank you.
[02:03:41.848 --> 02:03:45.330]  They dump out Al-Qaeda anywhere they want to take your rights.
[02:03:45.330 --> 02:03:52.232]  But also, at that time, they got tried with the Nuremberg trial and they used the same excuse that we're at war and we can do whatever we like.
[02:03:52.512 --> 02:03:55.173]  Well, see, that's the point I'm trying to make.
[02:03:55.173 --> 02:04:05.318]  If someone were ordered to kill an innocent American where there's no evidence that they have committed, you know, they're involved in terrorism... Is the disposition matrix enough?
[02:04:05.318 --> 02:04:06.859]  Please, please.
[02:04:06.859 --> 02:04:11.201]  The person carrying out the order could be prosecuted.
[02:04:11.201 --> 02:04:15.723]  In the military, you don't have the Nuremberg defense that I'm carrying out orders.
[02:04:15.723 --> 02:04:18.365]  So really, the men and women who pull the trigger
[02:04:19.325 --> 02:04:21.346]  On drones and who drop bombs.
[02:04:21.346 --> 02:04:22.366]  I know them.
[02:04:22.366 --> 02:04:25.868]  I know the pains they go through to prevent collateral.
[02:04:25.868 --> 02:04:30.469]  Yeah, I really We're not the SS.
[02:04:30.469 --> 02:04:36.712]  We're a very ethical Military the thought that goes into targeting people.
[02:04:36.712 --> 02:04:45.435]  Oh, yeah, you run al-qaeda publicly Obama is the head of al-qaeda, but the difference you are a lieutenant of al-qaeda leave with you are
[02:04:45.435 --> 02:04:46.835]  You are Al-Qaeda, Graham!
[02:04:46.835 --> 02:04:48.636]  You are Al-Qaeda!
[02:04:48.636 --> 02:04:50.216]  I call you out!
[02:04:50.216 --> 02:04:51.316]  I ouch you publicly!
[02:04:51.316 --> 02:04:52.116]  It's public!
[02:04:52.116 --> 02:04:53.237]  Karzai ouch you!
[02:04:53.237 --> 02:04:54.497]  We all ouch you!
[02:04:54.497 --> 02:04:55.937]  Al-Qaeda runs America!
[02:04:55.937 --> 02:04:57.938]  Obama is Al-Qaeda's commander!
[02:04:57.938 --> 02:04:59.158]  He is bin Laden!
[02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:01.799]  He is bin Laden!
[02:05:01.799 --> 02:05:07.640]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:05:08.556 --> 02:05:15.300]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:26.267]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[02:05:26.267 --> 02:05:30.409]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:05:30.409 --> 02:05:36.593]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:05:37.313 --> 02:05:37.974]  We're good to go!
[02:06:01.491 --> 02:06:10.037]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:06:10.037 --> 02:06:13.719]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[02:06:13.719 --> 02:06:18.162]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[02:06:18.162 --> 02:06:23.226]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[02:06:23.226 --> 02:06:30.731]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus,
[02:06:31.391 --> 02:06:31.851]  I think so.
[02:07:01.397 --> 02:07:04.819]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:07:04.819 --> 02:07:10.862]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:07:10.862 --> 02:07:14.744]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:08:13.735 --> 02:08:24.064]  Well, a year ago, he visited us in this very same studio, and it's one of the most popular interviews we've ever done with viewers of Infowars Nightly News and everybody on the radio show out in YouTube World.
[02:08:24.064 --> 02:08:29.588]  With more than 30 million records sold, he is one of the biggest rock stars in history.
[02:08:29.588 --> 02:08:35.813]  He founded the Smashing Pumpkins, which I've been a big fan of for years, since high school, really, or I guess college.
[02:08:35.813 --> 02:08:37.695]  But the real reason I'm a fan is
[02:08:37.915 --> 02:08:41.236]  He is an amazing thinker and gets me to think.
[02:08:41.236 --> 02:08:43.337]  As dumb as I am, that's hard to do.
[02:08:43.337 --> 02:08:49.539]  Billy Corrigan of Smashing Pumpkins here in town to play in Austin, Texas to a sold-out crowd.
[02:08:49.539 --> 02:08:50.419]  Good to have you here, my friend.
[02:08:50.419 --> 02:08:51.379]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:08:51.379 --> 02:08:54.980]  What we're seeing right now is a turf war, right?
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:09:02.943]  A turf war between old Republicans, you know, the Rush Limbaugh, what they call the old white men crowd.
[02:09:03.516 --> 02:09:07.520]  You know, as they're struggling for definition in a rapidly changing America.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:14.187]  Then you have, you know, the coming immigrant classes, which way they're going to go.
[02:09:14.187 --> 02:09:20.713]  You know, social liberals who are now willing to look the other way while we're doing, you know, these terrible things around the world with drones.
[02:09:20.713 --> 02:09:25.758]  And suddenly now those things aren't big issues to social liberals, which is black sites, torture.
[02:09:25.758 --> 02:09:26.299]  Unbelievable.
[02:09:26.559 --> 02:09:33.221]  Unbelievable to me that these are not mainstream issues on the front pages every day when our government is openly acknowledging in many ways.
[02:09:33.221 --> 02:09:34.962]  Warrantless wiretapping.
[02:09:34.962 --> 02:09:37.422]  Just the fact that we're being spied on blows my mind.
[02:09:37.422 --> 02:09:42.224]  They came out in Reuters and said, yeah, the Pentagon, everybody reads your bank account every day.
[02:09:42.224 --> 02:09:43.264]  I mean, totally illegal.
[02:09:43.264 --> 02:09:44.865]  Nixon was going to go to jail for it.
[02:09:44.865 --> 02:09:45.945]  And now it's just like, big deal.
[02:09:46.624 --> 02:09:47.224]  Right.
[02:09:47.224 --> 02:09:48.305]  So my point is this.
[02:09:48.305 --> 02:09:49.585]  So you see a turf war, right?
[02:09:49.585 --> 02:09:51.706]  So here's this dividing line.
[02:09:51.706 --> 02:10:03.292]  Okay, let's say free thinkers like you and I are over here and we're in our little huddled mass, and then this crowd over here wants to control everything, and let's call it the uninformed in the middle.
[02:10:03.952 --> 02:10:05.153]  Well, there's turf wars going on.
[02:10:05.153 --> 02:10:08.556]  It's like a football game where nobody can really score a touchdown, right?
[02:10:08.556 --> 02:10:14.061]  They haven't stamped people like you and me out, and certainly we're not going to stamp them out anytime soon.
[02:10:14.061 --> 02:10:15.362]  So it's back and forth.
[02:10:15.362 --> 02:10:18.986]  But if something happens where there's this open moment...
[02:10:19.775 --> 02:10:26.537]  Where suddenly 10, 20 million people are suddenly searching for new information because something gets exposed.
[02:10:26.537 --> 02:10:27.197]  You know what I mean?
[02:10:27.197 --> 02:10:34.120]  I think you have to be able to step into that void with a message that's greater than fear or greater than the counter response to the fear.
[02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:40.107]  Because, look, and you and I have talked in private besides publicly.
[02:10:40.107 --> 02:10:50.800]  And, you know, as I said when I sat in the same spot before, even if you're right, it's so hard for your average American to believe it's true.
[02:10:51.724 --> 02:10:52.705]  Do you know what I mean?
[02:10:52.705 --> 02:10:55.008]  So there's sort of a transitional moment.
[02:10:55.008 --> 02:10:57.931]  It's like in the Matrix when they realize they're in the Matrix.
[02:10:57.931 --> 02:11:00.573]  There's a moment like, how is this even possible?
[02:11:00.573 --> 02:11:03.376]  Or when they talk about people get out of jail and they just want to go back to jail.
[02:11:03.376 --> 02:11:06.980]  Well it's like the reality is so bad the guy goes, I want back in the Matrix.
[02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:07.821]  That's my point.
[02:11:07.821 --> 02:11:08.542]  That's my point.
[02:11:08.542 --> 02:11:09.963]  I know people.
[02:11:09.963 --> 02:11:12.766]  I know people and I'm sure many of your listeners
[02:11:13.587 --> 02:11:17.888]  Have these conversations around dinner tables where, you know, you reel off a list of facts.
[02:11:17.888 --> 02:11:18.908]  Did you realize this?
[02:11:18.908 --> 02:11:22.309]  And they go, I just don't want to know.
[02:11:22.309 --> 02:11:25.490]  I mean, they're raising... And it's because they have a legitimate point.
[02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:27.230]  The power structure's seized.
[02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:28.351]  What do you do about it anyways?
[02:11:28.351 --> 02:11:31.191]  But then if you give in, that just greases the skid.
[02:11:31.191 --> 02:11:32.192]  But my point is this.
[02:11:32.192 --> 02:11:39.193]  Those people that sit around those dinner tables that admit to their son or their daughter or their uncle, hey, you got a point.
[02:11:39.193 --> 02:11:40.254]  I know things are weird.
[02:11:41.644 --> 02:11:42.825]  But I'm not going to do it.
[02:11:42.825 --> 02:11:47.289]  But there will come a point where it's going to touch them in a way where they're going to have to do something.
[02:11:47.289 --> 02:11:48.429]  Well, I'll expand on that.
[02:11:48.429 --> 02:11:50.651]  I'm now hearing mainline talk radio.
[02:11:50.651 --> 02:11:52.573]  When Mohammed Karzai came out and said the U.S.
[02:11:52.573 --> 02:11:59.958]  government runs Taliban and Al Qaeda, which is well known, I heard all these hosts now going, you know, our government isn't even our government.
[02:11:59.958 --> 02:12:01.279]  It's interests that just want wars.
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:12.915]  Because they run them in Libya, they run them in Syria, Karzai says they run Al-Qaeda, Taliban, and then I heard the local host and I heard others go, you know, they do grow the opium over there.
[02:12:12.915 --> 02:12:14.337]  Why do we have a war on drugs?
[02:12:14.337 --> 02:12:18.162]  It's like, I think, listen, I don't want to be over positive.
[02:12:18.943 --> 02:12:29.705]  But if people just get the word out, say, like put your body against the machine, realize that these things are going on, I don't think it can move forward without our consent.
[02:12:29.705 --> 02:12:35.867]  And it's not even... But see, that's exactly my point, right?
[02:12:35.867 --> 02:12:38.547]  As with any... Let's be cold.
[02:12:38.547 --> 02:12:39.948]  It's a game, right?
[02:12:39.948 --> 02:12:41.348]  This is a big game.
[02:12:41.348 --> 02:12:45.729]  And who gets to win and who gets to control how the pieces move about the board?
[02:12:45.729 --> 02:12:45.969]  Okay.
[02:12:46.644 --> 02:12:47.825]  There is going to come a point.
[02:12:47.825 --> 02:12:49.687]  They may knock the whole board off.
[02:12:49.687 --> 02:12:51.388]  Well, that may happen.
[02:12:51.388 --> 02:12:55.691]  But that would only happen if they're willing to admit that people like you are right.
[02:12:55.691 --> 02:12:55.932]  Right?
[02:12:55.932 --> 02:12:57.093]  That'll be a double down.
[02:12:57.093 --> 02:12:58.314]  That'll totally legitimize it.
[02:12:58.314 --> 02:12:59.515]  Double down, right?
[02:12:59.515 --> 02:13:00.155]  Right.
[02:13:00.155 --> 02:13:07.381]  But the point is, let's say there's something cataclysmic, worthy of knocking all the pieces off the board.
[02:13:07.501 --> 02:13:09.262]  Worthy of shutting down the internet.
[02:13:09.262 --> 02:13:12.343]  Worthy of silencing any dissident voices.
[02:13:12.343 --> 02:13:15.724]  Even ones that would be considered mild dissident voices.
[02:13:15.724 --> 02:13:20.506]  Like has happened in other historical moments of tyranny.
[02:13:20.506 --> 02:13:21.086]  Right?
[02:13:21.086 --> 02:13:23.807]  And every time it was the same justification.
[02:13:23.807 --> 02:13:26.228]  We're doing this for the motherland, or the fatherland.
[02:13:26.228 --> 02:13:29.509]  The excuse will exist.
[02:13:29.509 --> 02:13:36.092]  It's what the populace does in that moment that will determine whether it's going to be 50 more years worse.
[02:13:37.578 --> 02:13:45.146]  Or it's going to have to go through the incredibly difficult kvetching of reality.
[02:13:45.146 --> 02:13:53.474]  If we've been in an imperial system all along, which there is evidence to suggest that we've been in an imperial system all along, well we're going to have to be accountable.
[02:13:54.204 --> 02:13:58.848]  Every person's going to have to be accountable on some emotional... No, I agree, and there's going to be a price.
[02:13:58.848 --> 02:14:08.575]  But the price is too big to keep going... What you just said, if they do push it to that, I think all the fake liberals, all the fake conservatives, what's happening is they've denied, denied, denied.
[02:14:08.575 --> 02:14:09.976]  And when you deny so long...
[02:14:11.283 --> 02:14:16.865]  You get to where you'll deny anything just to say you were right, but then it becomes so... What was the word you used?
[02:14:16.865 --> 02:14:19.105]  Absurdist.
[02:14:19.105 --> 02:14:25.367]  It becomes so absurdist that it becomes a joke, and I think that's what's happening in the past.
[02:14:25.367 --> 02:14:28.048]  It was like Robert Gibbs three weeks ago on TV.
[02:14:28.048 --> 02:14:31.369]  He came out and said... He said they told him there's no such thing as drones.
[02:14:31.989 --> 02:14:35.072]  And this is a guy who's supposed to go out there and put his entire credibility on the line.
[02:14:35.072 --> 02:14:36.493]  I mean, think of him as a human being.
[02:14:36.493 --> 02:14:37.574]  And he said it's Wizard of Oz.
[02:14:37.574 --> 02:14:39.016]  This is an admitted program.
[02:14:39.016 --> 02:14:41.758]  So let's look at it from a slightly spiritual perspective.
[02:14:41.758 --> 02:14:44.681]  I mean, Robert Gibbs is a real human being, right?
[02:14:44.681 --> 02:14:45.101]  Yeah.
[02:14:45.101 --> 02:14:45.702]  Okay.
[02:14:45.702 --> 02:14:46.943]  I'm sure he's got a family.
[02:14:46.943 --> 02:14:47.864]  Smart guy.
[02:14:47.864 --> 02:14:49.766]  He's obviously made his way up through the ranks.
[02:14:49.766 --> 02:14:52.188]  He probably worked, you know, crap jobs.
[02:14:52.188 --> 02:14:53.249]  So there he is.
[02:14:53.249 --> 02:14:55.791]  You're the PR guy for the president.
[02:14:55.791 --> 02:14:57.573]  You know, if you're a PR guy, I mean, that's the job.
[02:14:57.833 --> 02:14:59.897]  You're the number one guy in America.
[02:14:59.897 --> 02:15:00.758]  You got the best job.
[02:15:00.758 --> 02:15:01.560]  It comes to media.
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.723]  And then they tell you and they send out there and just basically lie.
[02:15:05.131 --> 02:15:09.092]  I mean, this guy's had to put his entire credibility, his entire career on the line, and lie about something.
[02:15:09.092 --> 02:15:10.573]  And then why would he come out now and say it?
[02:15:10.573 --> 02:15:12.013]  I'm seeing more and more of that.
[02:15:12.013 --> 02:15:13.773]  Because it's like any other regime.
[02:15:13.773 --> 02:15:16.434]  He's thinking, I don't want to go down with this ship.
[02:15:16.434 --> 02:15:23.696]  You're seeing now, there was another insider, can't remember what it was about recently, where another guy just, he wrote a book.
[02:15:23.696 --> 02:15:27.117]  But see, I think that Gibbs moment was like my Piers Morgan moment.
[02:15:27.117 --> 02:15:29.578]  More and more people are going, I'm not going to play along anymore.
[02:15:29.858 --> 02:15:34.580]  But the question is, the question if we're talking about it coldly like a game, right?
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:38.061]  The question is, does anybody care if the tree falls in the forest?
[02:15:38.061 --> 02:15:41.222]  So the spiritual issue is people better start caring again.
[02:15:41.222 --> 02:15:46.164]  But that's my point to you is, you can win all day long on the facts.
[02:15:47.901 --> 02:15:52.004]  I once sat here and said, even if everything you say is wrong, I like the argument.
[02:15:52.004 --> 02:15:53.304]  Now let me reverse it.
[02:15:53.304 --> 02:16:02.390]  Even if everything you say is right, there is a segment of the people in this country particularly, and in this world, that we need to get on board.
[02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:04.451]  We're not going to get them on board with fear.
[02:16:04.451 --> 02:16:06.292]  We're not going to get them on board with facts.
[02:16:06.292 --> 02:16:07.893]  We have to touch some other part of the world.
[02:16:07.893 --> 02:16:08.293]  Exactly.
[02:16:08.293 --> 02:16:08.774]  What do I do?
[02:16:09.514 --> 02:16:10.115]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:16:10.115 --> 02:16:15.539]  I think you have to, you have to diversify your message into a broader thing that's sort of unassailable.
[02:16:15.539 --> 02:16:17.401]  Okay, let's use the Star Wars analogy.
[02:16:17.401 --> 02:16:20.264]  The Death Star is orbiting the moon, Star Wars, you know, Episode 4.
[02:16:20.264 --> 02:16:22.666]  It's about to shoot the moon, and that's right when they blow it up.
[02:16:22.666 --> 02:16:24.147]  It's kind of that moment when both line up.
[02:16:24.147 --> 02:16:27.010]  That's, the stars are aligning.
[02:16:27.010 --> 02:16:28.931]  It's going to be in that fulcrum point.
[02:16:28.931 --> 02:16:30.293]  The dark side's gonna win.
[02:16:30.293 --> 02:16:30.813]  Yeah.
[02:16:30.813 --> 02:16:32.635]  And set you back a thousand years.
[02:16:32.635 --> 02:16:32.815]  Yeah.
[02:16:34.156 --> 02:16:40.886]  Or are you gonna, you're gonna go and, I mean, because, just because you stopped that Death Star doesn't mean you can stop the next one and the next one and the next one.
[02:16:46.553 --> 02:16:47.073]  All right, folks.
[02:16:47.073 --> 02:16:50.856]  We're entering this prime jump point zone, this crossroads.
[02:16:50.856 --> 02:16:53.178]  In closing, best interview I think I've ever done here.
[02:16:53.178 --> 02:16:54.118]  This is amazing.
[02:16:54.118 --> 02:16:58.662]  And I don't know, this is a powerful... You said we'd have a spiritual talk.
[02:16:58.662 --> 02:17:01.584]  I think this has been a transcendent talk.
[02:17:01.584 --> 02:17:05.807]  I want you to look at that camera out there, just right out there, in the last five minutes.
[02:17:06.247 --> 02:17:07.488]  And just, you've got the floor.
[02:17:07.488 --> 02:17:12.032]  Other points you think are important, because you've definitely taken me a long way into understanding.
[02:17:12.032 --> 02:17:13.734]  You said, Alex, you need to hit that next level.
[02:17:13.734 --> 02:17:18.118]  And you weren't, you're like, I don't know exactly what it is, but we all need to hit that next level to beat this.
[02:17:18.118 --> 02:17:21.561]  That Martin Luther King, Gandhi, or what Jesus talked about, that moment.
[02:17:21.561 --> 02:17:24.684]  So what in your gut, your spirit, right now, what do we do then?
[02:17:24.684 --> 02:17:30.849]  I'm talking to the people, because you're right, if they don't want this freedom, if they don't want to be free, if they want to be slaves, then we're going down.
[02:17:30.849 --> 02:17:32.911]  That's what I'm saying, we... So what do we say to them?
[02:17:33.976 --> 02:17:42.418]  I think you have to find, it's, look, just because I wrote one good song doesn't mean people are going to listen to the next one or the next one or the next one.
[02:17:42.418 --> 02:17:49.040]  It's the collective message that I've been able to create that's allowed me to have a wonderful musical life.
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:54.241]  Because I've been able to create sort of a broader message that has an appeal to lots of different people for lots of different reasons.
[02:17:54.241 --> 02:17:56.822]  I think you've been at the tip of the spear for a long time.
[02:17:57.762 --> 02:18:03.747]  Personally, on some level, that's worn you down because you are literally shouting against a mountain every day.
[02:18:03.747 --> 02:18:09.051]  If you can draw from a deeper well of source, sources that go back thousands of years.
[02:18:09.051 --> 02:18:10.513]  So I need to climb another mountain.
[02:18:10.513 --> 02:18:11.614]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:18:11.614 --> 02:18:20.381]  Go read or bring in somebody who's an expert in people who have a deeper understanding that bring in the historical and spiritual perspectives.
[02:18:20.381 --> 02:18:22.903]  Because we're not the first people that have faced this.
[02:18:23.103 --> 02:18:30.226]  Yes, we're the first people that have ever faced this in this way, with technology being at the core, the immediacy of communication.
[02:18:30.226 --> 02:18:34.808]  But you can't tell me 500 years ago or a thousand years ago, people weren't facing the same paradigm.
[02:18:34.808 --> 02:18:39.150]  Well, they were facing the Roman army that was like, you know, super high-tech compared to them.
[02:18:39.150 --> 02:18:40.990]  Tell me that was any different.
[02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:41.471]  Tell me it wasn't.
[02:18:41.471 --> 02:18:43.431]  It was the natives facing people with guns, yeah.
[02:18:43.431 --> 02:18:46.553]  But I'm saying, how were those things overcome?
[02:18:46.553 --> 02:18:48.633]  You said you're reading a book right now about the African slave trade.
[02:18:48.633 --> 02:18:49.734]  I've read those too, it's amazing.
[02:18:49.994 --> 02:18:53.739]  Yeah, I think the man's name was Barth.
[02:18:53.739 --> 02:18:56.562]  He traveled in Islamist Africa in the 1850s.
[02:18:56.562 --> 02:19:01.268]  He was a German guy, but somehow he got a British commission.
[02:19:01.268 --> 02:19:06.174]  And, you know, obviously the British were sending him down there to see how reasonable it would be to go in.
[02:19:06.414 --> 02:19:07.054]  I think so.
[02:19:35.472 --> 02:19:38.053]  You know, you're big tank against my big tank.
[02:19:38.053 --> 02:19:39.774]  It's just a different paradigm.
[02:19:39.774 --> 02:19:42.035]  My point is... Well, it's like local cops.
[02:19:42.035 --> 02:19:46.777]  This system's destroying their kids' future, but they'll still be mercenaries and do it.
[02:19:46.777 --> 02:19:49.558]  But look, I would take anybody at any system.
[02:19:49.558 --> 02:19:57.101]  I once went out with a woman who grew up in the Soviet system, emigrated in the 80s, lived there until she was 11 years old.
[02:19:57.101 --> 02:20:02.384]  She said her parents would tell her, don't talk too loud about the government because the neighbors will report us.
[02:20:03.493 --> 02:20:05.995]  I mean, imagine growing up in a society like that.
[02:20:05.995 --> 02:20:06.395]  You know what?
[02:20:06.395 --> 02:20:07.776]  Now we actually have to think about it.
[02:20:34.314 --> 02:20:35.375]  And we can't have a magazine.
[02:20:35.375 --> 02:20:37.316]  I said, I go, this is a joke, right?
[02:20:37.316 --> 02:20:38.097]  And he goes, no.
[02:20:38.097 --> 02:20:39.819]  Even I thought it was a joke.
[02:20:39.819 --> 02:20:43.722]  And then, because that would be national news if it happened in, you know, Russia or something today.
[02:20:43.722 --> 02:20:46.104]  And then I said, next time the cops come up, call me.
[02:20:46.104 --> 02:20:46.665]  So he calls me.
[02:20:46.665 --> 02:20:47.766]  They're there with the code enforcer.
[02:20:48.769 --> 02:20:50.111]  And the guy goes, no, I'm a listener.
[02:20:50.111 --> 02:20:53.134]  I don't like doing this, but my boss told me I'm going to do this.
[02:20:53.134 --> 02:20:55.557]  You need to take the stickers off or we're going to give you tickets.
[02:20:55.557 --> 02:20:57.079]  And if you don't go, then they're arrested.
[02:20:57.079 --> 02:20:59.361]  Let's look at it from a different perspective.
[02:20:59.361 --> 02:21:01.444]  The guy that's standing there, right?
[02:21:01.444 --> 02:21:02.645]  I'm a listener.
[02:21:02.645 --> 02:21:05.769]  I know this is stupid, but this guy up here told me I better do it.
[02:21:06.730 --> 02:21:14.398]  I meet TSA agents who are frisking me down, who are embarrassed to be frisking me down, because they know my music and they know me.
[02:21:14.398 --> 02:21:16.080]  And they're not a terrorist.
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:16.781]  Right.
[02:21:16.781 --> 02:21:18.823]  And they're embarrassed.
[02:21:18.823 --> 02:21:24.589]  Why are good-hearted Americans willing to follow orders?
[02:21:25.290 --> 02:21:27.411]  Do you know what I mean?
[02:21:27.411 --> 02:21:31.433]  Why in other tyrannical regimes were those people willing to follow orders?
[02:21:31.433 --> 02:21:33.734]  I think you have to address those questions.
[02:21:33.734 --> 02:21:39.317]  And I don't think you can address them on the veracity of the fact, which is it's dumb.
[02:21:39.317 --> 02:21:43.098]  Most people, if you sat them down at a table and explained the story, they'd say that's dumb.
[02:21:43.098 --> 02:21:45.680]  But this kind of dumb stuff's going on every day.
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:48.241]  Kids being expelled.
[02:21:48.241 --> 02:21:52.143]  Some kid said to another kid, five years old, something about shooting them.
[02:21:52.143 --> 02:21:53.864]  I mean, I grew up playing Cowboys and Indians.
[02:21:53.864 --> 02:21:54.344]  It doesn't mean I...
[02:21:55.264 --> 02:21:57.045]  If a donut looks like a gun, you're kicked out.
[02:21:57.045 --> 02:21:58.926]  What about the bubble gun girl?
[02:21:58.926 --> 02:22:15.316]  Right, what I'm saying is, I think you have to start getting into the mind of, and I hear you say it, and I think it's a powerful message when you say, hey, you out there who think you're going to get away with this and they're not going to come looking for you at some point, don't be fooled.
[02:22:15.316 --> 02:22:18.198]  But I think you have to get into the heart and mind of what their motivation is.
[02:22:18.658 --> 02:22:21.679]  You know, in wrestling we... They know that, but they're in the minute, they're scared.
[02:22:21.679 --> 02:22:22.820]  What they say in wrestling, right?
[02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:25.241]  The bad guy has to believe in what he's doing.
[02:22:25.241 --> 02:22:27.702]  So even the bad guy believes in what he's doing.
[02:22:27.702 --> 02:22:29.462]  You know, he's been propagandized.
[02:22:29.462 --> 02:22:32.323]  I'm beating this kid down for America.
[02:22:32.323 --> 02:22:33.904]  Or, you know, whatever they're thinking.
[02:22:33.904 --> 02:22:34.564]  You understand?
[02:22:34.564 --> 02:22:37.605]  I'm dropping this drone on a whole wedding party to get one guy.
[02:22:37.605 --> 02:22:38.286]  Collateral damage.
[02:22:38.286 --> 02:22:39.766]  I'm killing a terrorist.
[02:22:39.766 --> 02:22:46.569]  I would like you to see you broaden the message and bring in people who can speak to this kind of... whether it's a historian.
[02:22:49.755 --> 02:22:51.196]  We're good to go.
[02:23:10.905 --> 02:23:11.385]  Right?
[02:23:11.385 --> 02:23:23.476]  A lot of people are raised on junk food and Gilligan's Island and probably don't have the, I'm not saying they're stupid, but they don't have the intellectual capacity because they've never been in that situation to have to think like that.
[02:23:23.476 --> 02:23:29.602]  A lot of lower classes, which I come from in my family background, they're predicated on survival.
[02:23:30.376 --> 02:23:31.076]  Right?
[02:23:31.076 --> 02:23:35.178]  What was some of the way this last election was waged?
[02:23:35.178 --> 02:23:36.239]  It's survival.
[02:23:36.239 --> 02:23:40.281]  Hey, if I vote for this guy, I've got a better chance of surviving than if I vote for this guy.
[02:23:40.281 --> 02:23:42.862]  And then he raises payroll taxes on poor people.
[02:23:42.862 --> 02:23:44.343]  It's too late now.
[02:23:44.343 --> 02:23:44.663]  Right?
[02:23:44.663 --> 02:23:51.567]  What I'm saying is, my point is, you've got to explain to somebody who doesn't necessarily think like you.
[02:23:51.567 --> 02:23:57.790]  I think you diversify the import of the message so that it resonates at a higher level.
[02:23:57.790 --> 02:23:57.950]  Right?
[02:23:58.743 --> 02:24:05.388]  Most people believe in what America means, even though there's plenty of evidence to suggest we've killed and maimed plenty.
[02:24:06.215 --> 02:24:06.975]  Right?
[02:24:06.975 --> 02:24:12.859]  There are people out there, veterans, who really struggle with why they went here.
[02:24:12.859 --> 02:24:17.161]  You know, I know one kid who struggles with why he went over to Iraq.
[02:24:17.161 --> 02:24:18.662]  And the power structure knows that.
[02:24:18.662 --> 02:24:23.505]  They get them when they're 18, knowing later they're going to wake up, but by then they're now listed as the terrorist.
[02:24:23.505 --> 02:24:26.667]  What do you think about them saying veterans are the number one terror threat?
[02:24:26.667 --> 02:24:30.809]  It's interesting from this perspective.
[02:24:30.809 --> 02:24:33.691]  Look, you know, you watch the, you know, basketball game.
[02:24:34.312 --> 02:24:38.976]  And there's the commercial for the, you know, whatever, the Air Force.
[02:24:38.976 --> 02:24:40.617]  And it's like a video game, you know?
[02:24:40.617 --> 02:24:46.902]  Drones and, you know, it looks like, I literally think it's a video game commercial, until I realize it's for the Air Force or something.
[02:24:46.902 --> 02:24:47.583]  They're blurring it.
[02:24:48.314 --> 02:24:58.077]  Right, but they're bringing these people in, believing a set of ideals, which is consistent with, you know, American greatness or something.
[02:24:58.077 --> 02:24:59.057]  And freedom!
[02:24:59.057 --> 02:25:04.979]  Right, okay, so let's say you believe it, and nothing I say or you say would change their mind.
[02:25:05.439 --> 02:25:07.621]  America's the best, and I did this for a reason.
[02:25:07.621 --> 02:25:09.222]  I serve my country.
[02:25:09.222 --> 02:25:17.008]  Well, now we have a lot of evidence that suggests that they're not being supported when they come home, the Veterans Administration, all this kind of stuff, right?
[02:25:17.008 --> 02:25:21.451]  And even, like, them not allowing them to show the coffins when they come back.
[02:25:21.451 --> 02:25:22.632]  All that kind of stuff, right?
[02:25:24.042 --> 02:25:26.483]  Why are they flipping that narrative?
[02:25:26.483 --> 02:25:32.784]  Because that's a pretty big flip, from you're a hero, applaud the troops, to you can't even hold a gun.
[02:25:32.784 --> 02:25:34.544]  Now we don't trust you with a gun.
[02:25:34.544 --> 02:25:35.084]  Wow.
[02:25:35.084 --> 02:25:43.166]  Or I saw that clip where the city councilman objected because there was a guy who was a veteran, had a right to carry.
[02:25:43.166 --> 02:25:44.326]  Did you see that clip?
[02:25:44.326 --> 02:25:44.726]  Yes.
[02:25:44.726 --> 02:25:48.827]  And he got up and left because he said, I don't want to be in here.
[02:25:48.827 --> 02:25:50.668]  The guy was not breaking the law.
[02:25:50.668 --> 02:25:51.328]  He's a veteran.
[02:25:52.219 --> 02:25:53.099]  You know what I mean?
[02:25:53.099 --> 02:25:59.962]  They want to send him to foreign countries to kill people, but now when they have that right to defend themselves and have a second amendment here, they don't even want to be around it.
[02:25:59.962 --> 02:26:04.024]  It's like, but again, the technocrats want to send him to kill, but now they're scared of him.
[02:26:04.024 --> 02:26:08.586]  I'm trying to take, I'm just using this as a point to illustrate what I'm talking about.
[02:26:08.586 --> 02:26:10.687]  What's the higher perspective on that?
[02:26:10.687 --> 02:26:17.389]  Why do we sell somebody so hard as a hero, and then what propaganda do we need to use to believe that they're dangerous?
[02:26:17.389 --> 02:26:19.630]  It's like spiking a cannon after a war.
[02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:21.091]  They're decommissioning a weapon.
[02:26:21.877 --> 02:26:24.778]  Right, but why do they need to do it that way?
[02:26:24.778 --> 02:26:25.318]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:26:25.318 --> 02:26:26.238]  I watch that trend.
[02:26:26.238 --> 02:26:27.359]  Yeah, why are they?
[02:26:27.359 --> 02:26:29.039]  Because it's waking people up.
[02:26:29.039 --> 02:26:35.622]  I think the establishment has been very smart and professional in the past, but I think they've been smoking their own dope.
[02:26:35.622 --> 02:26:41.404]  I mean, more and more, because I always heard the argument that, you know, the elite are crazy, and I'm like, oh no, you know, they've got it all together.
[02:26:41.404 --> 02:26:44.365]  Why do you think they're doing it?
[02:26:44.365 --> 02:26:45.705]  That's a really good question.
[02:26:45.705 --> 02:26:47.586]  I think that's a very real question.
[02:26:50.262 --> 02:27:08.406]  I think the speed of information, even to the, let's say you're in American intelligence, and you're actually sitting at the top of the data heap, and you can see where it's going, and you're talking to the guy who's predicting what it's going to be like in 20 or 30 years.
[02:27:08.406 --> 02:27:16.628]  I think even if you're that guy, or that woman, you're sitting on top of that data heap, I think the speed at which this is moving is probably almost beyond human conception.
[02:27:17.731 --> 02:27:19.655]  Alright, and again, I did like an hour-long interview.
[02:27:19.655 --> 02:27:21.939]  That's 20 minutes of it.
[02:27:21.939 --> 02:27:24.023]  And we're going to air the rest of it on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:27:24.023 --> 02:27:26.568]  SmashingPumpkins.com.
[02:27:26.568 --> 02:27:28.733]  All the great music and information up there.
[02:27:29.798 --> 02:27:34.921]  And again, when I'm not all wound up on air, it's really interesting to sit back for hours and hear Billy talk about stuff.
[02:27:34.921 --> 02:27:39.143]  He really has a deep grasp on the world and what's going on in it.
[02:27:39.143 --> 02:27:51.430]  Speaking of the craziness going on in the world, John Rappaport is going to be joining us with his article, The CIA, James Holmes, MKUltra, and Truth Serum.
[02:27:51.430 --> 02:27:58.394]  In Hiding in Plain View last week, the Denver Post and others said, oh, the judge is going to order
[02:28:00.063 --> 02:28:06.210]  A truth serum to make him answer questions in the trial.
[02:28:06.210 --> 02:28:17.142]  Well, when you're under mind control, the very drugs they call truth serums are the ones they put you on, along with hallucinogens, to put you in the altered state where you don't know who you are.
[02:28:18.035 --> 02:28:23.081]  I mean, it's pretty easy to get a bunch of people on a high dose of acid and flip them out and make them go do violence while they're on it.
[02:28:23.081 --> 02:28:33.093]  You can take a normal person and put them on enough hallucinogens, LSD, PCP, at the same time, and a lot of the time you could get them to go in and kill their whole family, just in a one-off.
[02:28:33.093 --> 02:28:36.777]  They've done the test and shown that, and Congress has done hearings on it.
[02:28:37.538 --> 02:29:02.421]  But when you get somebody for months in a DARPA program, you can look at all the graduate students in the DARPA program at the university, you got Pentagon people over them, you give them a thirty-something thousand dollar grant to pay for their house, they're in a brain interface, a mind control program, and they're on all these drugs and now they don't want to release the toxicology report, they admit he was on seven drugs, psychotropics at his house, all these weird connections, the preparation, all of it, the way it was rolled out,
[02:29:03.141 --> 02:29:12.528]  The top Air Force psychiatrist was over a whole base in San Antonio, assigned to him, reported books that the prosecutors and defense aren't even wanting.
[02:29:12.528 --> 02:29:15.890]  Books that, you know, reportedly where he was planning it all.
[02:29:15.890 --> 02:29:20.974]  These guys also have a notebook that they write in that's part of their control book.
[02:29:20.974 --> 02:29:23.275]  It's like Catcher in the Rye, you know, it's like keywords.
[02:29:23.275 --> 02:29:24.676]  It's just standard.
[02:29:24.676 --> 02:29:27.198]  It turned out Sirhan Sirhan was under mind control.
[02:29:27.198 --> 02:29:28.078]  That's pretty much come out.
[02:29:28.939 --> 02:29:32.920]  So we're going to be looking at that, but again, calling it like it is.
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:34.260]  We're all under mind control.
[02:29:34.260 --> 02:29:35.601]  The government runs Al-Qaeda.
[02:29:35.601 --> 02:29:37.441]  It's admitted in hundreds of publications.
[02:29:37.441 --> 02:29:40.522]  But still, Al-Qaeda's our enemy, so we have to give our rights up.
[02:29:40.522 --> 02:29:41.683]  And the government's good.
[02:29:41.683 --> 02:29:45.884]  And the government's got to be able to kill citizens because of Al-Qaeda when they are running Al-Qaeda.
[02:29:45.884 --> 02:29:46.664]  That's the headline.
[02:29:46.664 --> 02:29:49.045]  Obama now global head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:29:49.045 --> 02:29:50.565]  Infowars.com.
[02:29:50.565 --> 02:29:51.945]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.945 --> 02:29:54.486]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.486 --> 02:29:57.147]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:05.549 --> 02:30:08.794]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.

[02:30:11.597 --> 02:30:13.740]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[02:32:01.232 --> 02:32:09.776]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:32:09.776 --> 02:32:13.457]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[02:32:13.457 --> 02:32:17.919]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[02:33:03.248 --> 02:33:10.972]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:39.369 --> 02:33:48.035]  Well, John Rappaport is a graduate of Amherst College with a BA in Philosophy and has worked on a freelance investigative reporter for 30 years.
[02:33:48.035 --> 02:33:55.920]  And again, he's worked for some of the largest publications in the country on investigative reporting, the Los Angeles Times, you name it.
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:00.223]  And of course, he's also done investigations for international and national television programs.
[02:34:00.223 --> 02:34:06.627]  NoMoreFakeNews.com is his website, and he is a frequent guest to this broadcast.
[02:34:06.627 --> 02:34:08.949]  But I saw the Denver Post and others
[02:34:10.050 --> 02:34:29.363]  Last week, engaged in unbelievable, off-the-chart, gigantic mind control operations where they just calmly, and I'll pull up the headlines for you in a moment, where they, if you're a TV viewer, I'll give the headlines out to radio listeners so you can search it yourself.
[02:34:29.363 --> 02:34:32.726]  Oh, judge to order Holmes to take truth serum during trial.
[02:34:34.073 --> 02:34:35.815]  And they just report it like, oh, that's a good thing.
[02:34:35.815 --> 02:34:36.956]  Thank God they're doing that.
[02:34:36.956 --> 02:34:41.861]  Folks, that group, that family of drugs is what they use to put you into mind control.
[02:34:41.861 --> 02:34:46.365]  I mean, that's even in movies like Conspiracy Theory, you know, about mind control of Mel Gibson.
[02:34:46.365 --> 02:34:48.868]  I mean, even in Hollywood movies, people know that.
[02:34:48.868 --> 02:34:51.510]  Sirhan Sirhan was put on amnesia drugs.
[02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:52.311]  That later came out.
[02:34:52.311 --> 02:34:54.774]  Even the LAPD said that and said he didn't shoot him.
[02:34:55.828 --> 02:34:59.789]  There have been court cases now proving there was CIA there when RFK got shot.
[02:34:59.789 --> 02:35:19.514]  So, this is so crazy that you've got him getting $30,000 plus, like $27,000 in one check and $7,000, $8,000 in another, over $30,000 in DARPA, Department of Defense Advanced Research Laboratories, funding to him in a secret brain program that he'd been in since high school.
[02:35:20.441 --> 02:35:23.823]  I mean, he was brought in from high school into college programs.
[02:35:23.823 --> 02:35:27.545]  Only the smartest do they do that within the testing.
[02:35:27.545 --> 02:35:40.853]  And then here he is, been in college for years, everything's paid for with this grant, and he's got an Air Force psychologist, psychiatrist, top level over him, and then they report multiple smoke bombs and multiple shooters.
[02:35:40.853 --> 02:35:44.796]  He tells people in the jail, I was drugged, I was under mind control.
[02:35:44.796 --> 02:35:46.177]  That came out in the local news.
[02:35:47.017 --> 02:35:53.842]  And then they said, oh, no, he wasn't around any prisoners, even though for weeks they'd reported the first few days he was with those prisoners next door to him.
[02:35:53.842 --> 02:35:55.804]  And now he was hissing and screaming and yelling.
[02:35:55.804 --> 02:35:59.246]  Now he's off the drugs, says he doesn't remember anything.
[02:35:59.246 --> 02:36:00.747]  They're keeping him very sequestered.
[02:36:00.747 --> 02:36:10.835]  And now they want to drug him again to go back to being the personality he was, the personality that thinks he did the shooting or may have done the shooting or taken part in it.
[02:36:10.835 --> 02:36:14.077]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they could take even a strong willed person like myself.
[02:36:14.077 --> 02:36:14.758]  They could take you.
[02:36:15.518 --> 02:36:28.110]  And they can, with shock therapy, LSD, PCP, peyote, halcyon, other amnesics, sodium pentothal, they can make you chop your newborn baby up.
[02:36:28.110 --> 02:36:29.932]  They can make you think you're another person.
[02:36:29.932 --> 02:36:32.674]  They can make you have the skills to be an opera singer.
[02:36:32.674 --> 02:36:38.460]  I mean, they can program you, and again, it's in the MKUltra, MKNaomi, congressional hearings in the 70s.
[02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:40.362]  This has all come out, okay?
[02:36:41.122 --> 02:36:50.966]  And I'm ranting, we're going to go to John Rapoport, who's an expert on this, and he's written the article, The CIA, James Holmes, MKUltra, and Truth Serum Torture, but here's the PSYOP on everybody.
[02:36:50.966 --> 02:36:56.029]  They're reporting they're going to drug him with mind control drugs, three of them, we're going to list them here.
[02:36:56.969 --> 02:36:57.729]  In public.
[02:36:57.729 --> 02:36:58.770]  So this is the new thing.
[02:36:58.770 --> 02:37:04.131]  They're going to not just drug you until you say you did something in the jail without charging you as they've done in cases.
[02:37:04.131 --> 02:37:09.692]  Some people in federal prison for 10 years before trial, drugging them, saying they're mentally ill, getting them ready for trial.
[02:37:09.692 --> 02:37:16.274]  In the case of Dr. Sell, a dentist who they said did Medicare fraud, he fought it so they just grabbed him and drugged him in Kansas City.
[02:37:17.274 --> 02:37:18.896]  So imagine this.
[02:37:18.896 --> 02:37:27.243]  There's so many cases of this now where they're grabbing lawyers that sue Williamson County, north of Austin, and so they go arrest the lawyer and commit him for two years.
[02:37:27.243 --> 02:37:30.306]  I mean, this is dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:30.306 --> 02:37:35.451]  And now they're out in the open going, yeah, we're now going to drug Americans for trial with mind control drugs.
[02:37:35.771 --> 02:37:39.194]  This is now Gitmo going mainstream.
[02:37:39.194 --> 02:37:47.700]  Now I'm ranting, I want to go directly to John Rappaport, but it's just like they hide Obama being the head of Al-Qaeda publicly and commanding Al-Qaeda.
[02:37:47.700 --> 02:37:50.962]  And so we put the headline out, Obama now global head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:37:50.962 --> 02:37:53.564]  That sounds crazy because it is absurdist.
[02:37:53.564 --> 02:38:00.009]  You've got to counter absurdist garbage by stating how absurdist it is, not processing it and watering it down.
[02:38:00.629 --> 02:38:05.876]  Now, John, I'm ranting here, but what is your take on this being out in the open?
[02:38:05.876 --> 02:38:07.158]  What does this signify?
[02:38:07.158 --> 02:38:12.966]  Are they all going to start publicly drugging us for trial so we say we did bad things?
[02:38:12.966 --> 02:38:15.590]  Yeah, this is MKUltra going mainstream, Alex.
[02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:17.112]  This is exactly that.
[02:38:17.711 --> 02:38:21.875]  This is the old CIA program and the new CIA program.
[02:38:21.875 --> 02:38:27.460]  This is, we're going to drug you till you say what we want you to say.
[02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:34.787]  And what most people don't realize about MKUltra was it started out, one big part of it, as we're going to find a truth drug.
[02:38:34.787 --> 02:38:36.989]  You know, this was back in the early fifties.
[02:38:37.709 --> 02:38:38.770]  They couldn't find one.
[02:38:38.770 --> 02:38:42.692]  In other words, these drugs don't work to make you tell the truth.
[02:38:42.692 --> 02:38:50.696]  What they do is they destroy your mind or they terrify you to the point where you will say what they want you to say.
[02:38:50.696 --> 02:38:51.816]  That's the big difference.
[02:38:51.816 --> 02:38:57.379]  And when they hit on LSD as the drug of choice, that's why they used it.
[02:38:57.379 --> 02:38:58.600]  It wasn't a truth drug.
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:00.461]  It didn't make people tell the truth.
[02:39:00.461 --> 02:39:03.142]  You don't download the truth out of somebody's mind.
[02:39:03.762 --> 02:39:18.690]  With one of these drugs, what you do is you either destroy their mind altogether, make them into a complete babbling idiot, or you bring them to the point where they're so terrified because of the dosage levels, you say to them, okay, you get the point now?
[02:39:18.690 --> 02:39:20.170]  Do you want to have this again?
[02:39:20.170 --> 02:39:24.673]  Or are you going to tell what we want you to tell?
[02:39:24.673 --> 02:39:32.417]  And this is, of course, all science, this is all neurology, this is all psychiatry, this is all the very best of the legal system.
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:44.323]  This is the brutal, incredibly torturous, this is torture, this is what MKUltra was, and now they're just mainstreaming it right out in the open.
[02:39:44.323 --> 02:39:50.145]  Here's what's going to happen to James Holmes, and we're going to call it a narco-analytic review.
[02:39:50.145 --> 02:39:53.405]  So it all sounds very fancy and so forth.
[02:39:53.405 --> 02:39:54.806]  And I'll tell you one other thing, Alex.
[02:39:55.953 --> 02:40:03.797]  The hacks who are the psychiatrists at the Colorado State Mental System Hospitals, they don't know anything about this.
[02:40:03.797 --> 02:40:06.319]  I mean, they're not the pros or the experts.
[02:40:06.319 --> 02:40:12.342]  They're going to have to bring in pros from the agencies that really know how to work these things.
[02:40:12.342 --> 02:40:16.704]  Oh no, they're going to probably bring in his very handlers that ran the operation.
[02:40:16.704 --> 02:40:17.345]  Exactly.
[02:40:17.345 --> 02:40:19.506]  And CIA people will be there.
[02:40:19.506 --> 02:40:22.067]  The people who have worked on this before.
[02:40:22.067 --> 02:40:25.209]  No, I'm saying, I bet it's going to be, that'll be the prime suspect.
[02:40:25.999 --> 02:40:30.680]  I bet, look for who actually programmed him to be who the expert they send.
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:46.565]  Because, because, listen, McVeigh had Jolion West, number two under MKUltra, congressional hearings, admittedly one of the fathers of modern mind control, assigned to him for the decade before they executed him, weekly, from the time he was arrested to executed, Jolion West was there.
[02:40:47.915 --> 02:40:52.747]  And then as soon as McVeigh would get off the drugs, he'd tell people, no I'm special forces, they set me up.
[02:40:52.747 --> 02:40:55.834]  And that's exactly what sworn affidavits from three different people say.
[02:40:57.176 --> 02:40:59.018]  Well, this is the same kind of thing.
[02:40:59.018 --> 02:41:08.388]  You bring in the handler, you bring in the person who is controlling, just like in the CIA, you know, I'm your case officer, so you report back to me.
[02:41:08.388 --> 02:41:18.999]  So they're going to puff this guy up to the point where he's going to come back into court, he's going to make some kind of bland statement like, yeah, I know I did it.
[02:41:19.961 --> 02:41:21.684]  Yes, that's true.
[02:41:21.684 --> 02:41:24.548]  I'm still... I still have problems.
[02:41:24.548 --> 02:41:30.879]  And then they'll just warehouse this guy for the rest of his life and destroy his mind, whether it's in prison or in a psych ward.
[02:41:30.879 --> 02:41:31.740]  It doesn't really matter.
[02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:32.040]  That's right.
[02:41:33.188 --> 02:41:34.269]  That's what's going to happen.
[02:41:34.269 --> 02:41:36.370]  This is unprecedented, though.
[02:41:36.370 --> 02:41:44.577]  But the story, this is the cherry on top, where they lied and said he was never around other inmates, when the inmates said, multiple ones, yeah, he said he was under mind control.
[02:41:44.577 --> 02:41:46.278]  That came out in the Denver Papers.
[02:41:46.278 --> 02:41:50.041]  They went, oh, no, he was never around people, even though they'd all admitted he had been.
[02:41:50.041 --> 02:41:57.026]  The fact that they're covering up the notebook, the fact that he's got this high-level, top Air Force psychiatrist over him, he's in a DARPA program.
[02:41:57.386 --> 02:41:59.869]  I mean, how transparent does this have to be?
[02:41:59.869 --> 02:42:06.236]  And now they're going to drug him with several mind control drugs to make him tell the truth.
[02:42:06.236 --> 02:42:10.220]  I mean, this is like total mainlining of this.
[02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:11.041]  Absolutely.
[02:42:11.041 --> 02:42:14.185]  And of course, when he was arrested, you know, first you have the story.
[02:42:14.825 --> 02:42:26.651]  That he was there at the exit of the theater the night of the shooting, and he just said, I did it, or something like that, and by the way, I've wired my entire apartment with explosives, so don't go near it.
[02:42:26.651 --> 02:42:29.653]  That was the first incredible, you know, bizarre story.
[02:42:29.653 --> 02:42:33.955]  And that was so they could send in a special federal team to cover up the seven medications that later still leaked.
[02:42:33.955 --> 02:42:39.658]  See, they don't have everybody under their control, but you see all the signs of the classic cover-up right there.
[02:42:39.658 --> 02:42:42.639]  There's no doubt in my mind now that Aurora was 100% staged.
[02:42:44.696 --> 02:42:45.737]  An operation.
[02:42:45.737 --> 02:42:58.027]  The second story was, well wait a minute, we actually found him in his car, and he was drugged, and he didn't really know what was going on, and you know, but we're not going to tell that story again, that's just a rumor and so on and so forth.
[02:42:58.027 --> 02:43:00.309]  Yeah, he's drooling in the car, out waiting.
[02:43:00.309 --> 02:43:02.291]  I mean, that was Sirhan Sirhan.
[02:43:02.291 --> 02:43:11.218]  Turned out they pinned his arm, all his bullets shot in the wall, and then we know the CIA agent's name, who was assigned to security, who worked in the skunk works, shot him in the back.
[02:43:11.218 --> 02:43:12.399]  I mean, it's on, it's in the NY
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:16.341]  I mean, in the LAPD file, it's public!
[02:43:16.341 --> 02:43:17.581]  Absolutely.
[02:43:17.581 --> 02:43:41.329]  And Special Unit Senator was the name of the LAPD, you know, office that was especially created to investigate the Bobby Kennedy assassination, saying, no, no feds, no anybody, this is our special unit, well, because we've got all the evidence, we can destroy it right away, we can distort it, we can do anything, and we can blame it all on Sirhan, and that's exactly what we're going to do.
[02:43:42.069 --> 02:44:02.082]  So we see this repeated time and time and time again with these mind control subjects that are put out there as the Patsy's and then they're tuned up afterwards so they say the right things you know as long as necessary to put them away out of sight so that nobody will ever hear from them again and they move right on to the next one.
[02:44:02.182 --> 02:44:06.845]  Well, that's what they did with McVeigh, as he would disappear for weeks when West would show up, who recently died.
[02:44:06.845 --> 02:44:09.106]  And he'd come back not knowing who he was.
[02:44:09.106 --> 02:44:11.728]  They'd been electro-shocking him, the reports are.
[02:44:11.728 --> 02:44:15.330]  And then they'd bring him back, as he'd start waking up and going, I'm Special Forces.
[02:44:15.330 --> 02:44:16.150]  They did this to me.
[02:44:16.150 --> 02:44:21.754]  Remember the state police found him drooling on the side of the road saying, help me, help me, I've got a chip in my butt?
[02:44:21.754 --> 02:44:22.194]  Remember that?
[02:44:22.654 --> 02:44:24.135]  Right, absolutely.
[02:44:24.135 --> 02:44:42.208]  And then the story they told, of course, you know, this was a perfect plan, this was the FBI talking, this incredibly brilliant plan, except the guy who did it just happened to have a license plate hanging off his car as he drove away and that's why we stopped him on a lonely road and that's how we put him in jail.
[02:44:42.208 --> 02:44:44.830]  You know, there were so many contradictions on that story.
[02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:50.775]  Well, the state police report said, drooling, begging, it burns, it burns, I've got a chip in my butt, that's the quote.
[02:44:50.775 --> 02:44:50.995]  Right.
[02:44:52.042 --> 02:45:04.128]  Well, you know, the public, as long as they keep buying this dumb show, we're going to see more and more and more of these, because, I mean, you can't get any more ridiculous than this thing that's happening with Holmes now.
[02:45:04.128 --> 02:45:05.549]  I mean, it's there.
[02:45:05.549 --> 02:45:06.990]  It's right out in the open.
[02:45:06.990 --> 02:45:10.892]  Yes, we're going to drug this guy, and then he'll say what we want him to say.
[02:45:10.892 --> 02:45:13.994]  I mean, anybody can read between the lines on this story and realize
[02:45:14.474 --> 02:45:15.214]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:45:15.214 --> 02:45:29.320]  Well, take the fake Pentagon trials of all these drugged up people that confessed to bombings that happened while they were in jail and stuff, and from waterboarding and drugging, and they admit they have a camp within X-Ray where they do all the drugging and the CIA doctors have a laboratory testing this stuff in there.
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:34.082]  Even the officers on the fake tribunal have been quitting and stuff and saying this is all a fraud.
[02:45:34.922 --> 02:45:35.523]  I think
[02:45:56.621 --> 02:45:58.022]  It's like a test run, you see.
[02:45:58.022 --> 02:45:59.983]  How stupid are people going to be?
[02:45:59.983 --> 02:46:03.806]  If we stand up and tell them the truth, what's the response going to be?
[02:46:03.806 --> 02:46:07.329]  Because here's how the programming works.
[02:46:07.329 --> 02:46:12.052]  You get somebody into a hypnotic trance over years and years of lies in the media.
[02:46:12.052 --> 02:46:14.494]  I mean, that kind of trance over and over again.
[02:46:14.494 --> 02:46:17.916]  And all of a sudden you stand up and you tell the truth about something.
[02:46:17.916 --> 02:46:24.741]  This creates such an incredible cognitive dissonance in most people that they pretend they've never even heard it.
[02:46:24.741 --> 02:46:25.622]  This is what happens.
[02:46:26.437 --> 02:46:27.217]  We didn't hear that.
[02:46:27.217 --> 02:46:28.238]  What do you mean al-Qaeda?
[02:46:28.238 --> 02:46:31.619]  What do you mean drugging homes?
[02:46:31.619 --> 02:46:32.019]  What?
[02:46:32.019 --> 02:46:32.339]  What?
[02:46:32.339 --> 02:46:33.920]  No, that's impossible.
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:44.664]  People will actually deny the truth even when the officials admit to it because the programming is so heavy that, you know, it's like, here are my choices.
[02:46:44.664 --> 02:46:52.887]  I stay hypnotized or I believe suddenly the truth is looking right at me, in which case, you know, I have to reject all of my life.
[02:46:53.723 --> 02:47:03.569]  Well, they know that people aren't going to do that, so they do these little test runs and they say, look, there's only, you know, a tenth of one percent of people that are saying, what's going on here?
[02:47:03.569 --> 02:47:04.569]  The rest are still asleep.
[02:47:04.569 --> 02:47:07.391]  Well, I mean, look, let's punch this up for TV viewers.
[02:47:07.391 --> 02:47:08.712]  Slate.com just came out.
[02:47:09.252 --> 02:47:13.693]  And said, can truth serum prove that James Hone is sane?
[02:47:13.693 --> 02:47:15.613]  Too high to lie.
[02:47:15.613 --> 02:47:17.914]  They're engaged in openly drugging people.
[02:47:17.914 --> 02:47:19.734]  The guy's never known who he is.
[02:47:19.734 --> 02:47:22.475]  He looked like textbook wide open mind control.
[02:47:22.475 --> 02:47:25.936]  Went off the drugs for days while he was with the cops flopping around.
[02:47:25.936 --> 02:47:30.677]  After it comes out and says they drugged me, this is mind control, help me.
[02:47:30.677 --> 02:47:34.078]  He tells a whole jail listening, help me, help me.
[02:47:34.078 --> 02:47:35.838]  And then we go, hey, he says they drugged him.
[02:47:36.138 --> 02:47:37.579]  And they go, oh no we didn't.
[02:47:37.579 --> 02:47:39.600]  No one heard him say that.
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:45.363]  I mean, this is one of the most incredible mind control things I've ever seen out in the open.
[02:47:45.363 --> 02:47:48.045]  And they're just reporting it like, oh yeah.
[02:47:48.045 --> 02:47:48.906]  And they're spinning it.
[02:47:48.906 --> 02:47:56.130]  We're going to drug him to make him tell the truth, too high to lie, when they drug you to make you highly suggestible to say whatever they want.
[02:47:56.718 --> 02:47:57.678]  That's right.
[02:47:57.678 --> 02:48:00.519]  Either make you highly suggestible or torture you.
[02:48:00.519 --> 02:48:02.440]  I mean, because these things are torture.
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:04.141]  Truth serum is torture.
[02:48:04.141 --> 02:48:05.301]  It's not there to get the truth.
[02:48:05.301 --> 02:48:06.822]  It's an anxiety drug.
[02:48:06.822 --> 02:48:07.382]  Exactly.
[02:48:07.382 --> 02:48:13.364]  It's there to put you into the kind of panic where you would do anything to get out of it.
[02:48:13.364 --> 02:48:14.424]  Anything.
[02:48:14.424 --> 02:48:17.845]  And then they say to you, OK, here's what we want you to do.
[02:48:17.845 --> 02:48:19.066]  Here's what we want you to say.
[02:48:19.066 --> 02:48:21.947]  Are you going to do it or are we going to do this to you again?
[02:48:22.548 --> 02:48:27.476]  I mean people have to understand that all this business about Gitmo and waterboarding and everything
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:35.824]  Did you ever hear in any of the media stories that they were saying, and were using drugs on these prisoners?
[02:48:35.824 --> 02:48:42.168]  No, it was all about isolation tanks and waterboarding and making fun of people and all that nonsense.
[02:48:42.168 --> 02:48:43.468]  Of course they're using drugs.
[02:48:43.468 --> 02:48:57.356]  It came out, and even in the Washington Post, like it was a good thing, like eight years ago, that they brought in, quote, prostitutes who were, I hate to, if family's listening, tell kids to tune out right now, women dressed in devil outfits doing satanic rituals
[02:48:58.524 --> 02:49:04.567]  Raping the men while they were menstruating to totally freak them out while they were on hallucinogens.
[02:49:04.567 --> 02:49:09.030]  Can you imagine being some 14 year old from Afghanistan who they want to become a new Al-Qaeda operative?
[02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:10.591]  That's why they manufacture them there?
[02:49:10.591 --> 02:49:12.612]  Well, they keep saying, why do they all become bombers?
[02:49:12.612 --> 02:49:17.875]  And women are dancing around while you're on drugs, raping you with blood everywhere?
[02:49:17.875 --> 02:49:19.156]  I mean, it's just...
[02:49:19.696 --> 02:49:21.137]  And the truth is they're just satanists.
[02:49:21.137 --> 02:49:24.240]  The truth is the CIA people just are engaged in satanism.
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:27.643]  This is just their excuse in under national security to do this.
[02:49:27.643 --> 02:49:32.908]  Why'd they rape kids in all 30-something camps in Afghanistan and Iraq?
[02:49:32.908 --> 02:49:34.469]  Because they like it.
[02:49:34.469 --> 02:49:35.690]  That's why.
[02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:37.792]  These are satanists.
[02:49:37.792 --> 02:49:43.497]  This is what happens when you have an agency where nobody knows from the beginning.
[02:49:45.302 --> 02:49:47.564]  1947, 48, all the way up until now.
[02:49:47.564 --> 02:49:49.646]  Nobody knows what they've been doing.
[02:49:49.646 --> 02:50:00.115]  I mean, untold amounts of billions of dollars in the announced budget, and then you got the black budget that nobody knows about, and it's sort of like, okay guys, this is it.
[02:50:00.115 --> 02:50:06.261]  You go back to the original MKUltra program and you will see quotes from people saying things like,
[02:50:06.801 --> 02:50:10.144]  We were free and wild, and we could do anything we wanted to.
[02:50:10.144 --> 02:50:22.472]  There was a guy named George White, who set up a brothel in San Francisco, where the prostitutes were giving their Johns LSD, unknown to the Johns, and CIA guys were looking through peepholes at all of this.
[02:50:22.472 --> 02:50:23.493]  And that's only the cover!
[02:50:23.493 --> 02:50:25.415]  They were doing it to mayors and people!
[02:50:25.415 --> 02:50:31.619]  We're Americans, red-blooded Americans, wild and free, and we can do whatever we want to, with no restraint.
[02:50:31.619 --> 02:50:32.660]  Well, that's what you get.
[02:50:33.635 --> 02:50:34.776]  And that's just the whitewash.
[02:50:34.776 --> 02:50:37.998]  You know, what about the people they threw off buildings?
[02:50:37.998 --> 02:50:38.458]  You bet.
[02:50:38.458 --> 02:50:40.599]  Frank Olson out of a hotel window.
[02:50:40.599 --> 02:50:41.079]  Sure.
[02:50:41.079 --> 02:50:42.000]  Absolutely.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:47.843]  This was all going on under Sidney Gottlieb's leadership, Helms, all these people.
[02:50:47.843 --> 02:50:54.487]  And what came out in the church hearings, Frank Church hearings in the 1970s before he died mysteriously.
[02:50:54.487 --> 02:51:00.451]  And then it came out that Ewing Cameron and Jolly and West were running operations with kids snatched off the streets.
[02:51:00.451 --> 02:51:00.931]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:02.085 --> 02:51:05.870]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:09.114]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[02:51:09.114 --> 02:51:11.938]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[02:51:11.938 --> 02:51:14.061]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[02:51:14.061 --> 02:51:16.905]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[02:52:01.198 --> 02:52:03.599]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:03.599 --> 02:52:06.901]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:52:06.901 --> 02:52:09.062]  Some people think the answer is gold.
[02:52:09.062 --> 02:52:10.663]  Others think it's a gun.
[02:52:10.663 --> 02:52:13.044]  But the correct answer will shock you.
[02:52:13.044 --> 02:52:20.868]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:52:22.249 --> 02:52:25.272]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:52:25.272 --> 02:52:27.414]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:52:27.414 --> 02:52:34.902]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:52:34.902 --> 02:52:39.387]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:52:39.887 --> 02:52:46.131]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:52:46.131 --> 02:52:47.472]  You'll be shocked.
[02:52:47.472 --> 02:52:52.676]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:52:52.676 --> 02:52:58.159]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:52:58.159 --> 02:52:59.520]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:53:01.121 --> 02:53:05.003]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:53:05.003 --> 02:53:06.023]  That bears repeating.
[02:53:06.023 --> 02:53:09.925]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:53:09.925 --> 02:53:14.487]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.

[02:53:29.535 --> 02:53:30.556]  Supports weight loss.
[02:53:30.556 --> 02:53:32.397]  Improves absorption of food nutrients.
[02:53:32.397 --> 02:53:34.018]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.
[02:53:34.018 --> 02:53:35.599]  Is never freeze-dried.
[02:53:35.599 --> 02:53:39.461]  And uses three groups of live, viable, beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.

[02:53:50.324 --> 02:53:51.405]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[02:54:12.498 --> 02:54:16.459]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've got to decide that you love reality.
[02:54:16.459 --> 02:54:18.340]  You've got to decide that you want the truth.
[02:54:18.340 --> 02:54:23.282]  Because there is a war on reality where they're trying to overthrow common sense.
[02:54:23.282 --> 02:54:26.823]  You've got to decide that you want to stand with the truth.
[02:54:26.823 --> 02:54:31.104]  And stop giving in to the lie that going along with corruption is going to make it easy on you.
[02:54:31.104 --> 02:54:32.125]  That's what lets it grow.
[02:54:33.081 --> 02:54:37.883]  Okay, you need to get an instinct to dislike oppressors and liars and scammers.
[02:54:37.883 --> 02:54:45.667]  So they've got people now where it's like, oh yeah, we lie about drones and we tell you it doesn't exist.
[02:54:45.667 --> 02:54:48.929]  And then now you see Michael Moore, who really is a demon.
[02:54:49.656 --> 02:54:54.098]  Now, licking his lips going, we had dead kid photos, we'd get their guns.
[02:54:54.098 --> 02:54:59.221]  Yeah, Harry Reid's little grandkids were all shot up and dead, we'd get the guns.
[02:54:59.221 --> 02:55:03.483]  He's just like, yeah, look at the little kids, they're dead now.
[02:55:03.483 --> 02:55:06.925]  I mean, these are monsters, folks, they know, okay?
[02:55:06.925 --> 02:55:12.848]  And believe me, if they'll, you know, Lindsey Graham's like, yeah, we kill 100 people per drone attack or whatever, collateral damage, we don't care.
[02:55:12.848 --> 02:55:16.070]  These men are heroes, we're not the SS.
[02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:18.311]  Yeah, you're 10 times probably worse if you could get there.
[02:55:18.831 --> 02:55:21.512]  You know, they really want to become pure evil.
[02:55:21.512 --> 02:55:24.714]  And of course they'll do Columbine.
[02:55:24.714 --> 02:55:26.275]  And you look at that, same story.
[02:55:26.275 --> 02:55:27.396]  Government run.
[02:55:27.396 --> 02:55:28.716]  I don't just say that.
[02:55:28.716 --> 02:55:30.037]  You think it's fun to know that?
[02:55:30.037 --> 02:55:32.298]  I wish it was just lone crazies.
[02:55:32.298 --> 02:55:34.820]  Almost every mass shooting is not even a copycat.
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:37.561]  There's a few that are copycats with all the media hype.
[02:55:37.561 --> 02:55:39.883]  It is government run from pillar to post.
[02:55:40.743 --> 02:55:42.684]  From pillar to post, folks.
[02:55:42.684 --> 02:55:44.005]  Pillar to post.
[02:55:44.005 --> 02:55:45.125]  You are collateral damage.
[02:55:45.125 --> 02:55:46.686]  They teach military.
[02:55:46.686 --> 02:55:49.728]  Going back more than 4,000 years about a gambit.
[02:55:49.728 --> 02:55:52.049]  It is a Persian military move.
[02:55:52.049 --> 02:56:00.334]  Where, and it's been adopted across the board, where you put out a hundred horsemen in a valley to draw in the main military force so you can attack them from both sides in a pincer.
[02:56:00.334 --> 02:56:03.195]  That's generally one of the basic cavalry moves.
[02:56:03.195 --> 02:56:05.857]  And you know your hundred horsemen are going to be wiped out.
[02:56:06.863 --> 02:56:12.915]  But the argument is, I would have lost the whole battle and lost 10,000 horsemen if I wouldn't have killed my hundred.
[02:56:12.915 --> 02:56:14.999]  That's why they send special forces on death missions.
[02:56:16.262 --> 02:56:21.804]  And being in a command position is all about accepting the lesser of two evils and all this, which is a lie.
[02:56:21.804 --> 02:56:22.924]  Injustifies the means.
[02:56:22.924 --> 02:56:23.845]  Machiavelli.
[02:56:23.845 --> 02:56:33.408]  It is a lie, folks, because pretty soon, oh, let's run Al-Qaeda, you know, because the public won't do what we want in the Middle East, and then they radicalize the Muslims to begin with.
[02:56:33.408 --> 02:56:35.208]  John, am I on target with what I'm saying here?
[02:56:35.208 --> 02:56:36.289]  Because this is a gambit.
[02:56:36.289 --> 02:56:36.869]  They are
[02:56:37.409 --> 02:56:38.729]  No, I don't disagree at all.
[02:56:38.729 --> 02:56:39.429]  They're staging events.
[02:56:39.429 --> 02:56:41.930]  I mean, this is the basis on which the whole CIA was founded.
[02:57:07.455 --> 02:57:13.623]  If you think about it, they went out into the world, we're gonna stage events and change reality.
[02:57:13.623 --> 02:57:14.845]  That was their mandate.
[02:57:14.845 --> 02:57:18.850]  It wasn't just to find out information, it was to create new reality.
[02:57:18.850 --> 02:57:20.993]  False flags all over the world!
[02:57:20.993 --> 02:57:22.916]  All over the world, all the time.
[02:57:22.916 --> 02:57:24.498]  Because, look, just from a
[02:57:24.998 --> 02:57:28.219]  Uh, uh, strategic point of view, tactical point of view.
[02:57:28.219 --> 02:57:41.701]  It's a heck of a lot easier to stage your own fake events and then come in afterwards than it is to actually go out there as an intelligence agency and find out what's happening in the world and they figured that out in about five minutes.
[02:57:41.701 --> 02:57:43.961]  Hey guys, we don't have to find out anything.
[02:57:43.961 --> 02:57:46.082]  All we have to do is to create reality.
[02:57:46.082 --> 02:57:52.463]  We stage events, tell the public what it means, rally support, and here we go into another war.
[02:57:52.463 --> 02:57:52.983]  It's easy.
[02:57:53.263 --> 02:57:54.864]  And that's what they did.
[02:57:54.864 --> 02:57:55.264]  Exactly.
[02:57:55.264 --> 02:57:58.026]  And I've talked to a lot of good old boys that go, well, that's what America does to get ahead.
[02:57:58.026 --> 02:58:00.288]  And I go, OK, let's say we're Machiavelli.
[02:58:00.288 --> 02:58:01.529]  We're not getting ahead.
[02:58:01.529 --> 02:58:03.890]  They're going to use this on us, you moron.
[02:58:03.890 --> 02:58:04.611]  You get it?
[02:58:04.611 --> 02:58:08.333]  So many people play the part like they're part of the structure.
[02:58:08.333 --> 02:58:09.154]  What do you call that?
[02:58:11.307 --> 02:58:12.868]  They're not getting ahead.
[02:58:12.868 --> 02:58:14.048]  They're losing.
[02:58:14.048 --> 02:58:18.031]  They're a bunch of losers who want to be attached to what they think is a winner.
[02:58:18.031 --> 02:58:22.515]  But it's not a winning proposition on any way you want to judge it.
[02:58:22.515 --> 02:58:24.816]  It's going down.
[02:58:24.816 --> 02:58:30.120]  Well, I mean, I can just feel God, you know, you call the universe whatever you want, anger at this.
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:31.301]  I mean, this does not go well.
[02:58:32.125 --> 02:58:32.525]  And stay there.
[02:58:32.525 --> 02:58:33.827]  We're going to do a little bit of overdrive.
[02:58:33.827 --> 02:58:34.888]  His Skype's having a problem.
[02:58:34.888 --> 02:58:36.109]  We're going to come right back.
[02:58:36.109 --> 02:58:37.411]  Overdrive with Rappaport.
[02:58:37.411 --> 02:58:37.991]  So much more.
[02:58:37.991 --> 02:58:38.952]  This is so key.
[02:58:38.952 --> 02:58:39.693]  Get our new article.
[02:58:39.693 --> 02:58:40.954]  Obama head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:40.954 --> 02:58:41.835]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:41.835 --> 02:58:42.616]  It's breaking.
[02:58:42.616 --> 02:58:43.677]  Obama head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:43.677 --> 02:58:44.979]  Publicly caught.
[02:58:44.979 --> 02:58:45.660]  Head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:45.660 --> 02:58:46.300]  Head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:47.421]  Head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:47.421 --> 02:58:48.483]  Obama head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:48.483 --> 02:58:49.864]  Did I tell you he's the head of Al-Qaeda?
[02:58:49.864 --> 02:58:50.445]  Head of Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:51.440 --> 02:58:58.663]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:58:58.663 --> 02:59:16.552]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:59:16.552 --> 02:59:20.654]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:59:20.934 --> 02:59:22.695]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:59:22.695 --> 02:59:30.861]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:59:30.861 --> 02:59:37.185]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:59:37.185 --> 02:59:38.466]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:59:38.466 --> 02:59:39.326]  It's incredible.

[02:59:48.553 --> 02:59:50.394]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:59:52.256 --> 02:59:53.798]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.798 --> 02:59:55.840]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.840 --> 02:59:59.044]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.107 --> 03:00:10.948]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.948 --> 03:00:12.529]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.529 --> 03:00:14.069]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.069 --> 03:00:18.271]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.271 --> 03:00:22.332]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.372 --> 03:00:37.997]  You know, I listen to my show and sometimes I can't listen to it because I get really obnoxious and start hyperventilating.
[03:00:37.997 --> 03:00:42.722]  But then I realized one of the few reasons I've been successful is because I am real.
[03:00:42.722 --> 03:00:44.364]  And I'm fundamentally upset about this.
[03:00:44.364 --> 03:00:50.470]  I mean, when they're publicly MK-altering people on TV now and I know they staged the shooting, that freaks me out.
[03:00:51.540 --> 03:00:58.825]  And I know I'm in danger doing this, but I'm in greater danger if we don't oppose these people in even the medium term.
[03:00:58.825 --> 03:01:03.589]  That's why I get so upset, because I know this is an animating contest for liberty.
[03:01:03.589 --> 03:01:05.610]  I know this is for all the marbles.
[03:01:05.610 --> 03:01:07.131]  I know how much danger we're in.
[03:01:07.131 --> 03:01:09.833]  And I'm genuinely freaked out, folks.
[03:01:09.833 --> 03:01:11.715]  You can't just deny this and it goes away.
[03:01:12.688 --> 03:01:19.391]  I mean, these are hardcore killers that run our government now, and that run the world, and they want to impoverish us.
[03:01:19.391 --> 03:01:23.053]  John Rappaport, I've been ranting, but just, how do we get people out of their trance?
[03:01:23.053 --> 03:01:28.816]  Because I've come out with the article, Obama is the head of Al-Qaeda worldwide, will White House target the White House?
[03:01:28.816 --> 03:01:30.117]  People are like, well, that's absurdist.
[03:01:30.117 --> 03:01:35.700]  No, they are the head, and if they're saying they're going to go after Al-Qaeda with drones, will Obama order a strike on himself?
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:41.881]  I mean, it's that absurd as you've got to point it out to get people to wake up to the illusion.
[03:01:41.881 --> 03:01:42.982]  Do you see my point?
[03:01:42.982 --> 03:01:46.603]  Yeah, absolutely, because that's the way you do get people to wake up.
[03:01:46.603 --> 03:01:50.364]  You show them the absurdity of what they're already believing.
[03:01:50.364 --> 03:01:54.625]  You know, like Obama comes out after Sandy Hook and he says, guess what?
[03:01:54.625 --> 03:02:03.767]  I just had this idea that we're going to do a 10-year, billion-dollar project with DARPA, with universities, to map the entire brain.
[03:02:05.250 --> 03:02:06.630]  You know, how absurd.
[03:02:06.630 --> 03:02:11.251]  And now this is going to be wonderful, we're going to cure all these diseases and so forth.
[03:02:11.251 --> 03:02:12.932]  This is completely absurd.
[03:02:12.932 --> 03:02:17.253]  All of a sudden, you just point out to people, hey look, don't you understand what they're trying to do?
[03:02:17.253 --> 03:02:20.394]  They're trying to control the brain completely.
[03:02:20.394 --> 03:02:22.874]  That's why they're putting the money in here.
[03:02:22.874 --> 03:02:27.335]  They're not trying to cure- And they're saying something they obviously were involved in and staged.
[03:02:27.335 --> 03:02:30.676]  We need this mind control to stop something we did.
[03:02:30.676 --> 03:02:31.536]  Exactly.
[03:02:31.536 --> 03:02:32.076]  There you go.
[03:02:32.076 --> 03:02:33.977]  So that puts the cap on the absurdity.
[03:02:34.497 --> 03:02:42.468]  Yeah, we did this over here, now we use that to promote this over here, and you're going along with it, right?
[03:02:42.468 --> 03:02:44.171]  Because you're idiots.
[03:02:44.171 --> 03:02:46.133]  So, do you want to wake up?
[03:02:46.133 --> 03:02:48.116]  Yeah, ah-ha-ha, do you want to wake up?
[03:02:48.116 --> 03:02:49.638]  Or do you want to stay asleep?
[03:02:50.586 --> 03:02:53.768]  And this is shoving it in people's faces.
[03:02:53.768 --> 03:02:57.671]  The absurdity of this, Alex, is exactly what wakes people up.
[03:02:57.671 --> 03:02:59.172]  Well, look at Operation Ajax.
[03:02:59.172 --> 03:03:14.343]  First destabilization thing after World War II, 1947, MI6, commanding CIA, Kermit Roosevelt, president's, you know, nephew, and, uh, former president's nephew, and they, they do mass shootings all over the country and blame the government for it.
[03:03:14.343 --> 03:03:17.265]  I mean, it's a fake false flag mass shooting.
[03:03:17.265 --> 03:03:17.885]  And it worked!
[03:03:17.885 --> 03:03:18.245]  It worked!
[03:03:18.245 --> 03:03:18.986]  Why not do them here?
[03:03:20.026 --> 03:03:22.708]  Do it over and over again.
[03:03:22.708 --> 03:03:27.972]  1995, you had the Committee on Radiation Experiments, uh, government hearings.
[03:03:27.972 --> 03:03:37.259]  All of a sudden, two witnesses got up and said, yeah, we received radiation when we were little kids, but this was part of a mind control program that we were involved in.
[03:03:37.259 --> 03:03:41.882]  We had been basically captured by military and CIA handlers.
[03:03:41.882 --> 03:03:43.283]  All this is on the record.
[03:03:43.283 --> 03:03:44.084]  They testified.
[03:03:44.084 --> 03:03:45.185]  There were people in the room.
[03:03:45.845 --> 03:03:46.645]  You can find this.
[03:03:46.645 --> 03:03:48.767]  You know, I want to come back when everybody's there.
[03:03:48.767 --> 03:03:50.888]  Some say you don't care this and get into that.
[03:03:50.888 --> 03:04:00.292]  Ewing Cameron, I knew about it, but I saw a History Channel thing like 10 years ago, an hour special, where they admitted they would take foster kids and also grab kids off the streets.
[03:04:00.292 --> 03:04:08.236]  And in the US and in Maryland, but also in Canada, they had a base and actually create fake identity and total program mind control slaves.
[03:04:08.236 --> 03:04:09.077]  And this is real.
[03:04:09.477 --> 03:04:10.760]  This is what they admit!
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:11.962]  Can you imagine?
[03:04:11.962 --> 03:04:16.371]  And then his number two becomes the doctor for McVeigh.
[03:04:16.371 --> 03:04:17.734]  I mean, come on!
[03:04:17.734 --> 03:04:18.436]  Yeah.
[03:04:18.436 --> 03:04:20.239]  And this guy, Ewan Cameron, was...
[03:04:21.055 --> 03:04:24.538]  The most decorated psychiatrist in the world at the time.
[03:04:24.538 --> 03:04:28.441]  He was president of every psychiatric society you can imagine.
[03:04:28.441 --> 03:04:36.306]  And not only did they grab kids off the street and put them through this horrendous program of trying to create new personalities.
[03:04:36.306 --> 03:04:37.708]  Electroshock!
[03:04:37.708 --> 03:04:47.255]  By torture, electroshock, a Nembutal, putting them to sleep for 30 days in a row with drugs, tapes playing over and over again.
[03:04:47.255 --> 03:04:48.616]  Stay there, come back, I'm gonna give you the floor.
[03:04:49.176 --> 03:04:51.058]  I'm gonna gag myself.
[03:04:51.058 --> 03:04:54.721]  Gentlemen, bring in... I'm gonna do it as a little piece where I get tied up during the piece.
[03:04:54.721 --> 03:04:56.342]  Like Hannibal Lecter.
[03:04:56.342 --> 03:04:58.244]  I'm the Hannibal Lecter of talk radio.
[03:04:58.244 --> 03:04:59.004]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.004 --> 03:05:01.666]  Stay with us with John Rappaport.
[03:05:01.666 --> 03:05:03.108]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:03.108 --> 03:05:13.776]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.776 --> 03:05:17.860]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:18.220 --> 03:05:20.963]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:20.963 --> 03:05:32.254]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.254 --> 03:05:35.417]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.717 --> 03:05:41.880]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.880 --> 03:05:51.764]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.764 --> 03:05:53.265]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.265 --> 03:05:55.165]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.165 --> 03:05:57.226]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.584 --> 03:06:06.346]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[03:06:06.346 --> 03:06:09.387]  I want you to know some very important information.
[03:06:09.387 --> 03:06:18.351]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[03:06:18.351 --> 03:06:23.273]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[03:07:46.482 --> 03:07:47.262]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:08:16.161 --> 03:08:29.252]  One reason I know that it's government psyops that is always running around saying I work for the CIA and all this stuff is because whenever I admit that I've had quite a bit of family that was in the CIA,
[03:08:31.363 --> 03:08:36.668]  They never attack that or go ferret into that because that's operations.
[03:08:36.668 --> 03:08:38.809]  You know, that's connected to their system.
[03:08:38.809 --> 03:08:39.950]  They don't want that looked at.
[03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:46.336]  That's why they make up outlandish stuff about me because they don't want you to believe there could be a real person standing up for liberty.
[03:08:46.336 --> 03:08:49.358]  The info I'm giving you, I don't want you to trust me.
[03:08:49.358 --> 03:08:50.719]  I want you to go look into it.
[03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:56.424]  I want you to go find out, when we talk about mind control, that it's a real thing.
[03:08:56.424 --> 03:09:01.327]  And that once you know what it is, you see it going on, and you catch them red-handed.
[03:09:01.327 --> 03:09:06.271]  And I've told a few of the CIA stories, you know, just from, I mean, anybody I know in my family.
[03:09:06.271 --> 03:09:09.233]  They recruited heavily, you know, out of farming areas in Texas.
[03:09:10.333 --> 03:09:14.615]  And I've, you know, I've talked to people, or other family talks, people that were in the CIA.
[03:09:14.615 --> 03:09:24.760]  They were almost all army officers, that's where they recruit from, who were combat veterans, who they then bring into it, and all of the people in my family got out of it.
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:26.201]  That's another lie that you don't get out of it.
[03:09:26.201 --> 03:09:29.022]  That's pure bull, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:29.022 --> 03:09:33.204]  And the point is, they won't ever even really talk much about it, just it's unspeakably horrible.
[03:09:33.204 --> 03:09:34.125]  They run everything.
[03:09:34.125 --> 03:09:36.926]  The murder, the drugs, all of it.
[03:09:36.926 --> 03:09:38.567]  One great uncle, it was basically
[03:09:40.145 --> 03:09:42.086]  I told my dad about it, and then I asked about it a little bit.
[03:09:42.086 --> 03:09:43.546]  He said, I'm not getting into that, but yeah.
[03:09:43.546 --> 03:09:45.227]  What was like, okay, you're an army officer.
[03:09:45.227 --> 03:09:46.127]  We're sheet dipping you.
[03:09:46.127 --> 03:09:49.448]  He'd been in the army for like 15 years, all over the world.
[03:09:49.448 --> 03:09:59.272]  He said, we're now going to have you, this is your graduation, not as just a asset, but as a, you know, officer, as a full-blown CIA agent.
[03:09:59.272 --> 03:10:04.133]  And it was dealing drugs and reportedly killing people in Chicago.
[03:10:04.133 --> 03:10:05.774]  And he said, I'm not doing that and got out of it.
[03:10:07.253 --> 03:10:13.759]  And, and, I mean, that, but listen, it's the same story with, like, anybody that I talk to.
[03:10:13.759 --> 03:10:19.344]  And folks, because it's not like it's a big deal that, oh, they really wanted to recruit, you know, out of some of the Alex Jones's relatives.
[03:10:19.344 --> 03:10:20.565]  There's CIA everywhere.
[03:10:20.565 --> 03:10:25.370]  It's like Jesse Ventura goes down on the first day at work, they go, somebody wants to talk to you in the bottom of the Capitol.
[03:10:25.370 --> 03:10:28.232]  He goes down there, there's 26, whatever it was, CIA people.
[03:10:28.232 --> 03:10:32.977]  They were like little old ladies and guys that look like milkmen or, you know, you know, beer men or whatever.
[03:10:33.297 --> 03:10:37.542]  And they were CIA, and wouldn't even say who they were, but it was national security.
[03:10:37.542 --> 03:10:45.072]  It's giant, ladies and gentlemen, and there's like 15, 16 agencies and private merc groups, and it's so evil.
[03:10:46.494 --> 03:10:48.395]  It is a mafia with mind control.
[03:10:48.395 --> 03:10:50.336]  And again, it works for the foreign banks.
[03:10:50.336 --> 03:10:56.300]  And there's all these movies about the CIA loves you, and the red, you know, red, white, and blue, and oh my gosh.
[03:10:56.300 --> 03:11:00.742]  And they do have the light side that does the analyst stuff that they send in.
[03:11:00.742 --> 03:11:03.004]  They send in the good guys, they're all like a joke.
[03:11:03.004 --> 03:11:07.066]  They send them out on commando missions to be killed.
[03:11:07.066 --> 03:11:08.167]  And again, they laugh at them.
[03:11:09.121 --> 03:11:12.444]  And I've talked to Joel Skousen, who's, you know, had those connections in family and stuff.
[03:11:12.444 --> 03:11:14.166]  Same story, same deal.
[03:11:14.166 --> 03:11:22.453]  Ladies and gentlemen, they get the most gung-ho, meanest people they can, and then they see, are you evil, tough guy, or are you a nice, tough guy?
[03:11:22.453 --> 03:11:24.155]  And the nice, tough guys are cannon fodder.
[03:11:24.155 --> 03:11:25.836]  So I'm going to warn everybody.
[03:11:25.836 --> 03:11:30.660]  If you're a police officer and they want you to work for the feds and do bombing drills, they're going to blow something up.
[03:11:30.660 --> 03:11:33.783]  Maybe not your time, but down the road, they're going to blow something up.
[03:11:33.783 --> 03:11:35.745]  Say a cop did it to say the cops are terrorists.
[03:11:35.925 --> 03:11:38.107]  When the Feds want to have a purge of you.
[03:11:38.107 --> 03:11:54.844]  If you're military and they want you to join an intelligence agency and infiltrate criminal groups, they're going to burn you down the road and say, you do what we say and help load up these toddlers on a C-130 ten years after you're into it, or we're going to expose all your bank robberies and all your drug dealing.
[03:11:54.844 --> 03:11:58.867]  I mean, that's all this is, is about compromising everybody, okay?
[03:11:59.548 --> 03:12:01.569]  That's all this is.
[03:12:01.569 --> 03:12:03.351]  And they're going to destroy our culture.
[03:12:03.351 --> 03:12:04.231]  Because they're into it.
[03:12:04.231 --> 03:12:06.372]  I'm ranting in this segment, the next.
[03:12:06.372 --> 03:12:08.134]  John Rutherford, break down mind control.
[03:12:08.134 --> 03:12:12.797]  As you were getting into Jolly and West, his controller, Dr. Ewing Cameron.
[03:12:12.797 --> 03:12:17.460]  What is admitted for people that don't know, so why we know James Holmes is under mind control.
[03:12:17.460 --> 03:12:18.420]  Go ahead.
[03:12:18.420 --> 03:12:25.545]  Ewing Cameron, as I was starting to say before we went to the break, not only were they pulling people off the street,
[03:12:26.471 --> 03:12:30.033]  But people were coming to him as patients.
[03:12:30.033 --> 03:12:31.654]  You know, somebody walks into his office.
[03:12:31.654 --> 03:12:34.875]  Here's a famous psychiatrist up in Canada.
[03:12:34.875 --> 03:12:38.637]  I'm not feeling very well, and I think I need some... Oh, sure, whatever.
[03:12:38.637 --> 03:12:55.065]  And all of a sudden, that person, you know, from anywhere, could be you, could be your cousin, could be anybody, is now in a program where they're being put to sleep for 30 days with heavy, heavy drugs.
[03:12:55.908 --> 03:13:05.830]  Waking in the middle of the night for electroshock treatments 20 to 40 times higher than the usual torture of shock treatments.
[03:13:05.830 --> 03:13:14.372]  Then they're going to be listening to you and Cameron with these tapes saying over and over again how he's creating a new personality.
[03:13:14.372 --> 03:13:16.493]  And then they spit that out the other side.
[03:13:17.253 --> 03:13:18.434]  New person.
[03:13:18.434 --> 03:13:19.454]  Yeah, new person.
[03:13:19.454 --> 03:13:21.275]  Totally destroyed.
[03:13:21.275 --> 03:13:22.556]  Totally destroyed.
[03:13:22.556 --> 03:13:34.103]  And of course you can read about this because there were lawsuits eventually brought and it was proven that Cameron was working on a contract via the CIA and they had to pay out some pit and some money to these people.
[03:13:34.103 --> 03:13:38.526]  But this was just one little pocket of what MKUltra was all about.
[03:13:38.526 --> 03:13:43.769]  Destroying people totally to give them new synthetic personalities.
[03:13:44.403 --> 03:13:47.925]  And again, they even have history channel shows admitting it all.
[03:13:47.925 --> 03:13:49.846]  And of course, it was also because they like to abuse kids.
[03:13:49.846 --> 03:13:51.307]  That's really the cover.
[03:13:51.307 --> 03:13:54.709]  It is the mind control and erasing their memories.
[03:13:54.709 --> 03:13:59.031]  But expanding on that, you describe how, yeah, not just kids off the street.
[03:13:59.031 --> 03:14:03.854]  Wealthy people will bring in their daughter who was depressed at age 10 because they describe all the cases.
[03:14:03.854 --> 03:14:07.156]  Thousands and thousands of something like 10,000 plus kids they know about.
[03:14:07.156 --> 03:14:09.317]  And they'd say, oh, just just commit her here.
[03:14:09.317 --> 03:14:10.658]  I'll make her perfect in a year.
[03:14:11.258 --> 03:14:15.263]  And they'd go, here, take our daughter, you know, worshipping the psychiatrist, because he's God.
[03:14:15.263 --> 03:14:21.190]  And they would literally electroshock, drug him, you know, rape him, everything else.
[03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:22.512]  And, oh, that couldn't be true.
[03:14:22.512 --> 03:14:24.414]  The doctor wouldn't do something like that.
[03:14:25.031 --> 03:14:37.333]  And let me tie that in, Alex, with what happens in ordinary psychiatry, see, because people have this false firewall that they build between MKUltra and the CIA and psychiatry.
[03:14:37.333 --> 03:14:38.254]  Just forget about that.
[03:14:38.254 --> 03:14:39.834]  Erase that wall.
[03:14:39.834 --> 03:14:40.954]  You're in a university.
[03:14:40.954 --> 03:14:41.674]  You're a student.
[03:14:41.674 --> 03:14:45.355]  You're feeling a little bit jittery, anxious about exams, whatever.
[03:14:45.355 --> 03:14:47.215]  You go in to see the psychologist.
[03:14:47.215 --> 03:14:48.876]  You get referred.
[03:14:48.876 --> 03:14:50.656]  You're sitting in a psychiatrist's office.
[03:14:51.156 --> 03:14:53.917]  And then, they give you a prescription for a drug.
[03:14:53.917 --> 03:14:58.438]  And this is based on a story by Peter Bragan in his famous book, Toxic Psychiatry.
[03:14:58.438 --> 03:15:00.659]  This is a girl that he calls Roberta.
[03:15:00.659 --> 03:15:03.440]  And, you know, she has some anxiety about dating.
[03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:05.600]  And so, ends up this drug.
[03:15:05.600 --> 03:15:06.801]  Well, we don't think that's the one.
[03:15:06.801 --> 03:15:07.701]  We'll give you this drug.
[03:15:07.701 --> 03:15:08.181]  No.
[03:15:08.181 --> 03:15:14.703]  And finally, they're putting her on serious, heavy, anti-psychotic drugs.
[03:15:14.703 --> 03:15:18.224]  And she gets to the point where she can no longer talk.
[03:15:18.784 --> 03:15:19.404]  Function.
[03:15:19.404 --> 03:15:21.545]  This is a bright girl from a decent home.
[03:15:21.545 --> 03:15:22.185]  Went to college.
[03:15:22.185 --> 03:15:24.486]  Hey, the American way.
[03:15:24.486 --> 03:15:25.667]  She's mumbling.
[03:15:25.667 --> 03:15:27.907]  She can't move without tremoring.
[03:15:27.907 --> 03:15:31.489]  She's knocking her head against the wall all the time.
[03:15:31.489 --> 03:15:39.812]  And eventually she comes to a general practitioner who says, this is all from the drugs.
[03:15:39.812 --> 03:15:41.712]  They've destroyed her life.
[03:15:41.712 --> 03:15:43.133]  She's never going to be the same.
[03:15:43.951 --> 03:15:46.712]  And nobody's prosecuted, nobody's criticized.
[03:15:46.712 --> 03:15:48.613]  Oh, it's the psychiatrist who did this.
[03:15:48.613 --> 03:15:52.776]  This could happen to any student on any campus at any university.
[03:15:52.776 --> 03:15:54.837]  And let me tell you who it happened to in the early 1960s.
[03:15:54.837 --> 03:15:58.799]  It was a man named Ted Kaczynski.
[03:15:58.799 --> 03:16:00.900]  You may have heard of him, the Unabomber.
[03:16:00.900 --> 03:16:06.442]  And I believe they had him to cut out the whole time to put out that eugenics-based report he put out as a publicity stunt.
[03:16:06.442 --> 03:16:07.483]  But he and the L.A.
[03:16:07.483 --> 03:16:10.524]  Times, Alexander Cochran was the one who exposed it in the L.A.
[03:16:10.524 --> 03:16:13.046]  Times, God rest his soul, recently passed.
[03:16:13.826 --> 03:16:16.088]  I believe I read that, but double check that my memory fails.
[03:16:16.088 --> 03:16:23.454]  The point is, he wrote about, it was declassified, Theodore Kaczynski was in the MKUltra mind control program.
[03:16:23.454 --> 03:16:28.217]  He went in to a psychologist, psychiatrist, and they drugged him.
[03:16:28.217 --> 03:16:35.082]  He disappeared into the program for years, comes out, but the media says there's no connection to his Unibombing.
[03:16:35.082 --> 03:16:40.306]  There, you don't just have MKUltra shooters, you've got MKUltra bombers.
[03:16:40.306 --> 03:16:40.667]  That's right.
[03:16:41.806 --> 03:16:44.052]  People disappear, they come back.
[03:16:44.052 --> 03:16:45.796]  Oh yes, I was in this program.
[03:16:45.796 --> 03:16:47.781]  Yes, I went to see a psychiatrist.
[03:16:47.781 --> 03:16:49.886]  This is what happened, and so on and so forth.
[03:16:50.643 --> 03:16:53.024]  And the public doesn't want to believe this, you see.
[03:16:53.024 --> 03:16:56.165]  But this is what you have to look at and understand.
[03:16:56.165 --> 03:16:57.386]  And by the way, here's the headline.
[03:16:57.386 --> 03:17:00.047]  We're reaping tragic legacy from drugs.
[03:17:00.047 --> 03:17:05.129]  The government LSD experiments to overuse of drugs like Ritalin.
[03:17:05.129 --> 03:17:06.750]  The consequences are overwhelming.
[03:17:06.750 --> 03:17:08.451]  And is that the one that's got the, yeah, there it is.
[03:17:08.451 --> 03:17:14.313]  Theodore Kaczynski was in a CIA Harvard MKUltra mind control experiments L.A.
[03:17:14.313 --> 03:17:15.134]  times.
[03:17:15.134 --> 03:17:18.575]  But I was saying double check is I think Alexander Cochran passed recently.
[03:17:18.575 --> 03:17:20.076]  I think I know he did, but I want to double check that.
[03:17:20.976 --> 03:17:23.098]  Go ahead there, John.
[03:17:23.098 --> 03:17:23.839]  Yeah.
[03:17:23.839 --> 03:17:28.282]  So you've got this kind of a program that spreads out tentacles all over the country.
[03:17:28.282 --> 03:17:41.592]  And as I was saying, in 1995, all of a sudden, you had two women testifying before the President's Committee on Radiation Experiments saying, yeah, but that was just a small part of what we were into since the time we were children.
[03:17:41.912 --> 03:17:56.704]  We were basically tortured by army doctors, CIA doctors, in a mind-control program that radiation was just a small part of, and the idea was they wanted to make us into sex agents and assassins.
[03:17:56.704 --> 03:18:08.694]  And this is taking place in a committee room in Washington, D.C., before a panel and an audience in the room, and they get through testifying, and the panel is absolutely silent.
[03:18:10.020 --> 03:18:15.561]  And then one person says, well thank you very much, next witness will please come up, as if nothing ever happened.
[03:18:15.561 --> 03:18:32.125]  And as these two witnesses walk back from testifying, people in the audience get up and go over to them and say, thank God you said something because I was here to talk about radiation too, but the same thing happened to me that happened to you.
[03:18:33.194 --> 03:18:36.517]  And the truth is, people ask, where's the new order going?
[03:18:36.517 --> 03:18:38.578]  It's the trip, not the destination.
[03:18:38.578 --> 03:18:43.622]  The destination is kill everybody, because that's their dream, and they use a cosmetic environmental excuse.
[03:18:43.622 --> 03:18:49.266]  They all like raping little children and stuff, and so they do it under national security.
[03:18:49.266 --> 03:18:50.988]  Or, some of them like killing kids, you know.
[03:18:51.288 --> 03:18:54.650]  It's about the fact that they're now going to do anthrax vaccine on children.
[03:18:54.650 --> 03:18:57.912]  I mean, this to me is like, yeah, we want to destroy children and kill children because we like to do it.
[03:19:13.602 --> 03:19:23.731]  I mean, there's no other possible reason that they're going to test this anthrax vaccine on kids.
[03:19:23.731 --> 03:19:26.954]  Because they know it's completely destructive and toxic.
[03:19:26.954 --> 03:19:31.478]  They know kids have nothing to do with any sort of national security baloney.
[03:19:32.222 --> 03:19:34.344]  They're doing it because they want to do it.
[03:19:34.344 --> 03:19:35.564]  Yeah, we want to do it.
[03:19:35.564 --> 03:19:39.587]  We want to give this to kids to torture them and to destroy them.
[03:19:39.587 --> 03:19:44.370]  It is such a fun thing for them to... Exactly, because they admit they don't want to kill you quickly.
[03:19:44.370 --> 03:19:49.374]  There's nothing more beautiful than them, a child having debilitating stuff for like 20 years and then dying horrible deaths.
[03:19:49.374 --> 03:19:51.275]  I mean, that is just a beautiful thing.
[03:19:51.275 --> 03:19:56.119]  The worse the cancer, the more horrible, the more debilitating, hurting little children.
[03:19:56.119 --> 03:19:57.379]  It's so beautiful to them.
[03:19:57.379 --> 03:19:58.920]  And it's a gift to Lucifer, their God.
[03:19:58.920 --> 03:19:59.461]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.656 --> 03:20:03.557]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:20:03.557 --> 03:20:07.200]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[03:20:07.200 --> 03:20:11.783]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:20:11.783 --> 03:20:17.867]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:20:17.867 --> 03:20:28.655]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[03:20:28.855 --> 03:20:35.337]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[03:20:35.337 --> 03:20:50.282]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and
[03:20:55.283 --> 03:21:04.145]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[03:21:04.145 --> 03:21:09.986]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body?
[03:21:09.986 --> 03:21:13.986]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[03:21:13.986 --> 03:21:16.827]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[03:21:18.067 --> 03:21:18.427]  We're good!
[03:21:35.703 --> 03:21:48.269]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.

[03:22:30.663 --> 03:22:39.989]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[03:22:39.989 --> 03:22:40.790]  This capitalism?
[03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:47.074]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:22:47.074 --> 03:22:47.875]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:47.875 --> 03:22:51.017]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[03:22:51.017 --> 03:22:51.937]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.937 --> 03:22:53.358]  It's time to understand the system.
[03:22:53.358 --> 03:22:53.678]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:53.678 --> 03:22:53.959]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.903 --> 03:23:06.067]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives Ed peace of mind.
[03:23:06.067 --> 03:23:15.693]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[03:23:15.693 --> 03:23:27.641]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[03:23:27.941 --> 03:23:32.525]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[03:23:32.525 --> 03:23:34.307]  And they're so easy to use.
[03:23:34.307 --> 03:23:36.228]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[03:23:36.228 --> 03:23:40.232]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[03:23:40.232 --> 03:23:42.014]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.
[03:23:43.755 --> 03:23:47.379]  Order your FAKE TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to FAKETV.com.
[03:23:47.379 --> 03:23:49.000]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com.
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:51.443]  FAKETV, the burglar deterrent.
[03:24:05.558 --> 03:24:11.307]  Alright, people are really getting what I'm saying with Obama now, global head of Al Qaeda.
[03:24:11.307 --> 03:24:14.292]  Will President order drone strikes on the White House on himself?
[03:24:14.292 --> 03:24:20.321]  Like Eagle Eye, where the computer is told go after criminals and so it goes after the government because it sees the government as criminal.
[03:24:20.862 --> 03:24:24.806]  Now, again, I'm saying we're battling absurdity with absurdity.
[03:24:24.806 --> 03:24:27.308]  We're not manufacturing the absurdity.
[03:24:27.308 --> 03:24:33.895]  We are actually showing the absurdity, because he is supposedly the head of the U.S.
[03:24:33.895 --> 03:24:35.817]  military, and then that really controls NATO.
[03:24:36.963 --> 03:24:39.104]  And has the dominant voting in that.
[03:24:39.104 --> 03:24:46.946]  And it's running Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria publicly, and now Mohammed Karzai's come out that they're running it in Afghanistan and all these other places.
[03:24:46.946 --> 03:24:48.027]  That's there.
[03:24:48.027 --> 03:24:50.067]  So he is the head of Al-Qaeda.
[03:24:50.067 --> 03:24:51.948]  The titular head, bare minimum.
[03:24:51.948 --> 03:25:03.932]  And so my point is, it shows they're running Al-Qaeda, but they're saying they can kill Americans anytime they want with that precedent, if they think you're even connected to a group that might be connected by three layers of separation to Al-Qaeda.
[03:25:04.850 --> 03:25:07.651]  And it's just a joke, so we're calling their hoax.
[03:25:07.651 --> 03:25:12.231]  Other media is like, why does our government give missiles to al-Qaeda and run them and let them travel around?
[03:25:12.231 --> 03:25:17.612]  And why did the head of number two in al-Qaeda meet secretly at the Pentagon, Amir al-Awlaki, Fox News?
[03:25:17.612 --> 03:25:19.913]  And then no one calls it for what it is.
[03:25:19.913 --> 03:25:22.173]  I'm calling it for what it is.
[03:25:22.173 --> 03:25:23.794]  And it's absurd.
[03:25:23.794 --> 03:25:26.374]  It is absurd that the government runs al-Qaeda.
[03:25:26.374 --> 03:25:30.795]  It is absurd that if they were really fighting al-Qaeda, they would call drone strikes on themselves.
[03:25:32.110 --> 03:25:33.111]  Which they're puppets as well.
[03:25:33.111 --> 03:25:34.011]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[03:25:34.011 --> 03:25:35.672]  We wish them long lives in prison.
[03:25:35.672 --> 03:25:37.553]  The point is, is that I know the White House listens.
[03:25:37.553 --> 03:25:38.314]  Media Matters listens.
[03:25:38.314 --> 03:25:39.335]  They're on record, they do.
[03:25:39.335 --> 03:25:40.635]  They respond to us.
[03:25:40.635 --> 03:25:43.837]  Because no one else out there at this level is calling them out.
[03:25:43.837 --> 03:25:44.698]  Let me close with this.
[03:25:44.698 --> 03:25:46.899]  John Rapoport of nomorefakenews.com.
[03:25:46.899 --> 03:25:47.740]  You're a smart guy.
[03:25:47.740 --> 03:25:48.781]  You know your history.
[03:25:48.781 --> 03:25:50.362]  Why do you think I'm still on the air?
[03:25:50.362 --> 03:25:51.823]  Why do you think you're able to do what you do?
[03:25:52.983 --> 03:25:55.104]  And what do you think of my point I just made?
[03:25:55.104 --> 03:25:59.407]  Because I saw some commenters saying, Alex has joined them, saying fight absurdity with absurdity.
[03:25:59.407 --> 03:26:00.187]  No, no, no.
[03:26:00.187 --> 03:26:04.850]  I am stating how absurd it is, not making stuff up.
[03:26:04.850 --> 03:26:08.031]  I am equalizing it, saying this is what it really is.
[03:26:08.031 --> 03:26:09.472]  Isn't that absurd?
[03:26:09.472 --> 03:26:13.815]  Can you talk about the subtleties of that or why we're still alive?
[03:26:13.815 --> 03:26:17.917]  Well, I think we're still alive because there are a lot of people that are listening.
[03:26:18.786 --> 03:26:25.558]  And it would be a little bit maybe crossing over the line to try to, you know, eliminate that voice.
[03:26:25.558 --> 03:26:31.509]  I mean, I don't know how many million people are listening to this thing right now or going to tap into it in the next few days.
[03:26:32.327 --> 03:26:34.849]  Because you're making the point all the way, Alex.
[03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:35.710]  That's the thing.
[03:26:35.710 --> 03:26:41.294]  You're not saying, well, I think I've got a story and it's really big and I'm going to break it in six weeks.
[03:26:41.294 --> 03:26:43.736]  No, it's right now in your face totally.
[03:26:43.736 --> 03:26:49.441]  In fact, I think that NBC should put you on to replace Jay Leno and I'll be your sidekick.
[03:26:49.441 --> 03:26:49.821]  I'll be your...
[03:26:51.022 --> 03:26:57.426]  And we'll sit there and you say, hey Cindy, you're now 15 years old and you sold 12 billion records already as a pop singer.
[03:26:57.426 --> 03:27:00.968]  Tell me, were you part of the CIA mind control program?
[03:27:00.968 --> 03:27:02.489]  Oh Alex, of course I was.
[03:27:02.489 --> 03:27:04.750]  Let me tell you about what happened to me in Virginia.
[03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:12.855]  We'll go on and do this stuff every night on a Tonight Show and then we'll really see what happens.
[03:27:12.855 --> 03:27:18.379]  Because the fraud, see people say that patriots bring them into Alice in Wonderland.
[03:27:19.062 --> 03:27:20.302]  That we take them down the rabbit hole.
[03:27:20.302 --> 03:27:24.844]  John, aren't we trying to take people out of the Alice in Wonderland, out of the rabbit hole?
[03:27:24.844 --> 03:27:26.924]  Yeah, you see, here's the operation.
[03:27:26.924 --> 03:27:35.566]  You tie ropes around their ankles, and you lower them all the way down to the rabbit hole, and then you say, see, and then you bring them back up again.
[03:27:35.566 --> 03:27:37.387]  That's what we're doing.
[03:27:37.387 --> 03:27:44.709]  Oh, that's even better than what I was saying, getting, exactly, you've gotta, well, basically you're already in Alice in Wonderland, we've gotta get the blinders off so they see it.
[03:27:45.936 --> 03:27:46.976]  That's right.
[03:27:46.976 --> 03:27:48.116]  Take the blinders off.
[03:27:48.116 --> 03:27:49.457]  Look where we are.
[03:27:49.457 --> 03:27:50.577]  This is Wonderland.
[03:27:50.577 --> 03:27:52.577]  There's the Mad Hatter over there.
[03:27:52.577 --> 03:27:53.337]  And so on and so forth.
[03:27:53.337 --> 03:27:54.718]  They're all here.
[03:27:54.718 --> 03:27:56.098]  You know?
[03:27:56.098 --> 03:27:57.958]  They're all sitting in the... You know, I agree with you, though.
[03:27:57.958 --> 03:28:00.899]  You wrote an article after my Piers Morgan, and I think you're dead on.
[03:28:00.899 --> 03:28:02.879]  You weren't just saying that.
[03:28:02.879 --> 03:28:06.100]  It shook them because it went all the way.
[03:28:06.100 --> 03:28:08.400]  It just called the little man behind the curtain.
[03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:09.121]  There you go.
[03:28:09.121 --> 03:28:10.361]  This is the thing.
[03:28:10.361 --> 03:28:10.641]  You see,
[03:28:11.301 --> 03:28:20.823]  People, some people would say, no, no, no, when Alex was on the Pierce, you see, he should have presented point one, two, three, four, five, six, oh, this is why guns are okay, whatever.
[03:28:20.823 --> 03:28:23.343]  No, that's just playing right into their hands.
[03:28:23.343 --> 03:28:24.604]  Don't you get it, people?
[03:28:24.604 --> 03:28:26.064]  I mean, come on.
[03:28:26.064 --> 03:28:31.625]  So Alex goes on and Pierce says, okay, now tonight we're going to, and that's all.
[03:28:31.625 --> 03:28:32.605]  That's all, folks.
[03:28:32.605 --> 03:28:33.745]  He was finished.
[03:28:33.745 --> 03:28:35.826]  Because Alex jumped all over him.
[03:28:35.826 --> 03:28:36.266]  Bang.
[03:28:37.006 --> 03:28:38.787]  That's what you do.
[03:28:38.787 --> 03:28:42.509]  You don't go halfway, you go all the way.
[03:28:42.509 --> 03:28:42.969]  That's right.
[03:28:42.969 --> 03:28:47.091]  What has enslaved us is going halfway.
[03:28:47.091 --> 03:28:49.492]  Notice the globalists aren't going halfway, are they?
[03:28:49.492 --> 03:28:50.172]  No.
[03:28:50.172 --> 03:28:51.133]  Yeah, right.
[03:28:51.133 --> 03:28:53.474]  We want to control half the world, right?
[03:28:53.474 --> 03:28:56.435]  No, they're not saying that, right?
[03:28:56.435 --> 03:28:57.036]  Yeah.
[03:28:57.036 --> 03:29:00.117]  We'll take the southern hemisphere and let you folks alone up top.
[03:29:00.117 --> 03:29:01.018]  Hey, John, do you need to go?
[03:29:02.894 --> 03:29:04.295]  I don't need to do anything, I'm here.
[03:29:24.354 --> 03:29:26.937]  Mind control, the news, all of it with John Rappaport.
[03:29:26.937 --> 03:29:28.498]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[03:29:28.498 --> 03:29:29.259]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:29.259 --> 03:29:30.400]  Help us get our article.
[03:29:30.400 --> 03:29:32.202]  Obama now global head of Al Qaeda.
[03:29:32.202 --> 03:29:32.862]  Go all the way.
[03:29:32.862 --> 03:29:33.523]  That's what it is.
[03:29:33.523 --> 03:29:34.664]  Call it like it is.
[03:29:34.664 --> 03:29:35.965]  It's absurd, but it's real.
[03:29:35.965 --> 03:29:37.206]  Get it out there.
[03:29:37.206 --> 03:29:39.168]  John Rappaport's coming back after this quick break.
[03:29:39.168 --> 03:29:42.091]  He's going to host the next two segments of the transmission.
[03:29:42.091 --> 03:29:43.712]  John, thanks for being on the show with us, buddy.
[03:29:43.712 --> 03:29:44.413]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:29:44.413 --> 03:29:45.274]  It's great.
[03:29:45.274 --> 03:29:47.316]  You're in command when we come back in three minutes.
[03:29:50.885 --> 03:29:54.817]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.817 --> 03:29:57.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.869 --> 03:30:03.290]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:03.290 --> 03:30:13.978]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:30:13.978 --> 03:30:21.183]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[03:30:21.183 --> 03:30:31.490]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next
[03:30:31.670 --> 03:30:33.010]  We're good to go.
[03:31:02.113 --> 03:31:04.494]  You've heard about our MRE Smorgasbord.
[03:31:04.494 --> 03:31:12.718]  Now, Long Life Food Depot introduces the most unique, safe, and longest-lasting way to stash emergency food, the EatPod.
[03:31:12.718 --> 03:31:19.221]  Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps, low moisture, and low oxygen.
[03:31:19.221 --> 03:31:21.622]  If you're storing in a basement, too humid.
[03:31:21.622 --> 03:31:23.663]  Garages and attics, too hot.
[03:31:23.663 --> 03:31:28.205]  But the waterproof, double-walled, high-density polyethylene patent-pending EatPod
[03:31:28.365 --> 03:31:41.876]  is a unique rollaway food bunker that creates the perfect conditions, can be buried up to 30 feet, and can keep your survival food supply safe, secure, dry, and virtually undetectable for 25 years or more.
[03:31:41.876 --> 03:31:48.482]  Get full details on the Eatpod at eatpod.com spelled E-A-T-P-O-D dot com or call 800-601-2833.
[03:31:48.482 --> 03:31:48.702]  That's 800-601-2833.
[03:31:48.702 --> 03:31:50.463]  The Eatpod from Long Life Food Depot.

[03:32:21.078 --> 03:32:21.618]  Yes, only $37.95.
[03:32:21.618 --> 03:32:23.178]  That's 70% less than our competitors.
[03:32:25.239 --> 03:32:28.622]  You could buy three Survival Seed Vaults for less than one of theirs.

[03:33:15.316 --> 03:33:29.622]  Before sitting in for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show for the last half hour, I think Alex is going to go off to NBC and work the Tonight Show tonight, because obviously they're getting rid of Jay Leno.
[03:33:29.622 --> 03:33:30.863]  They don't need him anymore.
[03:33:30.863 --> 03:33:32.764]  What we need is the truth.
[03:33:32.764 --> 03:33:36.345]  And that's what Alex and I touched on in the last segment here.
[03:33:36.345 --> 03:33:39.667]  And I want to just blast this home further.
[03:33:39.667 --> 03:33:42.408]  The point is, if you go halfway, you lose.
[03:33:43.996 --> 03:33:55.744]  That's why when he went on with Piers Morgan, and just got completely into his face, it broke that hypnotic spell that everybody's used to when they're watching television.
[03:33:55.744 --> 03:34:09.352]  Oh, this is very civilized, and yes, we have these people over here, and oh, George Stephanopoulos disagrees with Chris Papua, oh yes, and you know, this is all the charade, this is all the puppet show.
[03:34:09.352 --> 03:34:11.694]  This is all for the purpose of mind control.
[03:34:12.404 --> 03:34:24.454]  Mind control through information to get you to accept the idea that Brian Williams, you know, knows more about reality than we could possibly imagine.
[03:34:24.454 --> 03:34:32.660]  Therefore, we have to tune into him every night and go into a state of trance, as he tells us what's happening on the news.
[03:34:32.660 --> 03:34:40.727]  So what Alex is saying is, no, you go all the way when you tell the truth, because they're lying all the way.
[03:34:41.786 --> 03:34:47.528]  The globalists don't want just half the planet, they want everything, and that's what they're going for.
[03:34:47.528 --> 03:34:52.490]  What do you think mind control programs that the CIA have been running for years are all about?
[03:34:52.490 --> 03:34:58.533]  It's to totally destroy the individual human being and remake the human being.
[03:34:58.533 --> 03:35:00.053]  That's what they're trying to do.
[03:35:00.053 --> 03:35:03.655]  It's not, oh, let's just shift a few little things here.
[03:35:03.655 --> 03:35:05.575]  Let me just fill you in on a couple things.
[03:35:05.575 --> 03:35:06.996]  We talked about you and Cameron.
[03:35:07.990 --> 03:35:14.503]  The Canadian researcher who is the head of the World Psychiatric Society, decorated from here to the moon in the 1950s, and was
[03:35:17.714 --> 03:35:23.120]  Remaking people's personalities as patients, whether they liked it or not.
[03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:37.175]  They would just come in to his office and all of a sudden they would be enrolled in a couple of month long program, put them to sleep for 20 or 30 days on end with Nembutal, Thorazine, compounds like that which are brain destroying.
[03:35:37.175 --> 03:35:38.537]  Wake them up in the middle of the night,
[03:35:39.488 --> 03:35:47.093]  Give him incredibly heavy shock treatments at 20 to 40 times the strength of ordinary shock treatments, which are already torture.
[03:35:47.093 --> 03:35:49.655]  This is torture, by the way, nothing else.
[03:35:49.655 --> 03:35:59.883]  And then he would subject them to 12 to 16 hours a day, day after day of his audio tapes, instructing them on what person they were going to be.
[03:35:59.883 --> 03:36:02.124]  Now you are, this is important.
[03:36:02.124 --> 03:36:03.945]  This is what you're going to be.
[03:36:03.945 --> 03:36:07.348]  The man was making over a human being into a machine.
[03:36:08.402 --> 03:36:10.603]  Destroying human lives.
[03:36:10.603 --> 03:36:14.583]  Eventually, suits were filed years and years later.
[03:36:14.583 --> 03:36:19.624]  CIA was implicated, admitted it, paid out of pittance.
[03:36:19.624 --> 03:36:26.006]  This is just a peek into what the real purpose of the mind control program is, you see.
[03:36:26.006 --> 03:36:28.867]  They're going all the way, that's my point.
[03:36:28.867 --> 03:36:32.187]  If they're going all the way, we have to go all the way.
[03:36:32.187 --> 03:36:33.247]  Absolutely.
[03:36:33.247 --> 03:36:35.468]  And that's why Alex's
[03:36:36.235 --> 03:36:42.217]  Extraordinarily successful in what he's doing because he's going all the way as a human being.
[03:36:42.217 --> 03:36:43.538]  So why can't you?
[03:36:43.538 --> 03:36:44.258]  Why can't I?
[03:36:44.258 --> 03:36:49.660]  Why can't anybody go all the way with what the truth of the situation is?
[03:36:49.660 --> 03:37:03.446]  It was Jose Delgado, a Yale researcher, oh, very, very exclusive elite researcher, who said in the 1950s, the human being does not have an inherent right to his own personality.
[03:37:06.485 --> 03:37:14.129]  What do you think these people are doing with technocracy and the whole mind-brain interface?
[03:37:14.129 --> 03:37:31.058]  Oh yes, we're going to hook you up to machines and computers and life is going to be completely different in the next coming 10-20 years because these computers are going to be able to do more than the brain could ever do before and we're going to have a human-machine future.
[03:37:31.058 --> 03:37:35.440]  They want to totally remake over the human being into a slave.
[03:37:36.224 --> 03:37:38.645]  Into a machine, that's what it's all about.
[03:37:38.645 --> 03:37:44.086]  They can say it's not, they can say it's this, it's that, but that's where the program is going.
[03:37:44.086 --> 03:37:46.347]  They're going all the way!
[03:37:46.347 --> 03:37:48.207]  So, what about you?
[03:37:48.207 --> 03:37:49.928]  In telling the truth?
[03:37:49.928 --> 03:38:05.032]  Is it better to just say, well, you see, it's quite possible that they may have made an error in their calculation about the following... Are we going to just keep carrying on a conversation at that level?
[03:38:06.451 --> 03:38:15.480]  When the truth is right there for anybody who wants to see it and say it and put it out there, put it out there.
[03:38:15.480 --> 03:38:16.421]  Don't stink.
[03:38:16.421 --> 03:38:19.064]  Don't hold yourself back.
[03:38:19.064 --> 03:38:27.613]  What's happening now in America with money, with the economic collapse, which is being lied about as been documented on it for wars.
[03:38:28.703 --> 03:38:31.025]  From one end to the other about employment figures.
[03:38:31.025 --> 03:38:31.526]  Oh, yes.
[03:38:31.526 --> 03:38:33.167]  Well, we're making a strong comeback here.
[03:38:33.167 --> 03:38:35.189]  No, we're not making a strong comeback here.
[03:38:35.189 --> 03:38:38.131]  Not making a strong comeback at all.
[03:38:38.131 --> 03:38:44.097]  The people who have been put out of work are stopping to look for work or they're getting low paying jobs.
[03:38:44.097 --> 03:38:46.259]  Just anything to survive.
[03:38:46.259 --> 03:38:51.003]  It was destruction by plan to torpedo the economies of the world.
[03:38:51.980 --> 03:39:04.187]  Worse than they're already being torpedoed to go all the way and destroy these economies, to steal all your money, and then to say, well, you're angry about that?
[03:39:04.187 --> 03:39:04.648]  Really?
[03:39:04.648 --> 03:39:06.809]  We have to declare martial law!
[03:39:06.809 --> 03:39:09.230]  We have to put in a state of emergency!
[03:39:09.230 --> 03:39:16.695]  I mean, we're doing the best we can to reignite the economy in the coming months, etc., etc., etc.
[03:39:16.695 --> 03:39:19.917]  Lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying.
[03:39:20.427 --> 03:39:27.940]  The operation, the globalist operation, is to destroy economies of every nation, to put them all the way under.
[03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:45.897]  And to rebuild a cashless, digitized money system from the ground up, based on the lie that it is somehow more humane and fair and just and humanitarian and, you know, all of that, for the population.
[03:39:45.897 --> 03:39:50.179]  We redo the whole money system because we don't have any social justice.
[03:39:51.007 --> 03:39:53.849]  No social justice with the present money system.
[03:39:53.849 --> 03:39:55.870]  We're going to have to redo it all.
[03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:57.551]  That's where they're going.
[03:39:57.551 --> 03:40:06.616]  And then, as Alex has been talking about, as I've been talking about, others have been talking about, every single transaction in the world will be
[03:40:07.827 --> 03:40:10.629]  You don't have any choice about what you pay, what they steal from you.
[03:40:38.703 --> 03:40:44.207]  And as my good friend Catherine Austin Fitts said, this is what they'll hide behind.
[03:40:44.207 --> 03:40:45.108]  The algorithm.
[03:40:45.108 --> 03:40:46.949]  Well, we've all put it on the computer now.
[03:40:46.949 --> 03:40:50.972]  We have the model and the algorithm, and this is the way the new money system's gonna work.
[03:40:50.972 --> 03:40:53.894]  And so, that's just the way it is.
[03:40:53.894 --> 03:40:55.775]  It's the best there is.
[03:40:55.775 --> 03:40:57.396]  Don't blame us.
[03:40:57.396 --> 03:40:58.457]  It's the computers.
[03:40:58.457 --> 03:40:59.278]  Yeah, sure.
[03:40:59.278 --> 03:40:59.598]  Sure it is.
[03:41:00.490 --> 03:41:01.791]  Sure it is.
[03:41:01.791 --> 03:41:03.592]  That's where they're heading with this.
[03:41:03.592 --> 03:41:09.257]  The science fiction that we all thought about 20 years ago is here now, you see.
[03:41:09.257 --> 03:41:11.778]  It's here now.
[03:41:11.778 --> 03:41:19.945]  And so that's why the response that we have to make it, to it, is all out all the time.
[03:41:19.945 --> 03:41:20.785]  Say it all.
[03:41:20.785 --> 03:41:21.766]  Speak the whole truth.
[03:41:22.762 --> 03:41:36.426]  The whole truth about mind control, where it was really born, how it really worked, how in the United States in the 1940s, check this out, okay?
[03:41:36.426 --> 03:41:38.426]  Tune it up, the brain.
[03:41:38.426 --> 03:41:51.570]  In the 1940s, if you were a mental patient in a California State Hospital, you could not be discharged from that hospital until you were sterilized.
[03:41:53.377 --> 03:41:55.059]  Sterilize.
[03:41:55.059 --> 03:41:56.460]  That's right.
[03:41:56.460 --> 03:42:02.866]  The Americans were into the eugenics program before the Nazis were.
[03:42:02.866 --> 03:42:17.099]  People like Paul Pocono, they were doing all kinds of things to sterilize people, as detailed by another great friend of mine and fantastic hero, Dr. Peter Bragan.
[03:42:17.099 --> 03:42:19.501]  The whole point of
[03:42:20.262 --> 03:42:38.992]  The American Psychiatric Association in the 1940s in America, early 1940s, was to have a debate about whether the mentally retarded, in quotes, you know, the mentally deficient, should be, get it, sterilized or killed.
[03:42:38.992 --> 03:42:39.873]  That was the debate.
[03:42:40.811 --> 03:42:57.658]  It was a big debate carried out on the pages of their professional journal, and eventually, in an editorial written in 1942, in the American Psychiatric Association Journal, the decision was... kill him.
[03:42:57.658 --> 03:42:59.259]  Mentally deficient?
[03:42:59.259 --> 03:43:00.180]  Kill him.
[03:43:00.180 --> 03:43:01.560]  Do you think that's going all the way?
[03:43:01.560 --> 03:43:02.721]  Oh, yeah.
[03:43:02.721 --> 03:43:07.823]  Do you think they just abandoned this whole idea of control?
[03:43:09.159 --> 03:43:10.420]  Oh, we're not going to do that anymore.
[03:43:10.420 --> 03:43:10.920]  No.
[03:43:10.920 --> 03:43:12.561]  The only thing that's changed is the PR.
[03:43:12.561 --> 03:43:13.601]  The PR has gotten better.
[03:43:13.601 --> 03:43:14.481]  That's all.
[03:43:14.481 --> 03:43:18.123]  It's just as destructive now as it was then.
[03:43:18.123 --> 03:43:28.107]  In 1942, they said, the American Psychiatric Association, kill all mentally deficient children in America.
[03:43:28.107 --> 03:43:29.808]  That's our policy.
[03:43:29.808 --> 03:43:31.509]  And you psychiatrists
[03:43:32.222 --> 03:43:51.372]  And I'm paraphrasing from the editorial, are going to have to use your psychological skills in talking to the parents of the children that are going to be killed to convince them that it's really in their best interest and the best interest of their child to be murdered.
[03:43:51.372 --> 03:43:54.053]  That's the legacy, folks.
[03:43:54.053 --> 03:43:55.474]  That's the legacy that we're dealing with.
[03:43:56.994 --> 03:43:58.477]  And that legacy is not stopped.
[03:43:58.477 --> 03:43:59.139]  It's continued.
[03:43:59.139 --> 03:44:01.364]  The history is continuous.
[03:44:01.364 --> 03:44:04.671]  It's gone on from that point right up until the present.
[03:44:04.671 --> 03:44:07.838]  The only thing that's changed is pharmaceutical companies.
[03:44:10.998 --> 03:44:13.879]  We're going to have more and more and more people
[03:44:31.527 --> 03:44:33.108]  Send to psychiatrists.
[03:44:33.108 --> 03:44:35.710]  People that we say, oh, their behavior's a little odd.
[03:44:35.710 --> 03:44:37.711]  So, oh, we don't like what they said.
[03:44:37.711 --> 03:44:38.672]  Oh, you said that?
[03:44:38.672 --> 03:44:40.173]  Oh, Facebook blocked that?
[03:44:40.173 --> 03:44:41.874]  Oh, Evans to Betsy.
[03:44:41.874 --> 03:44:43.595]  Go to see a psychiatrist.
[03:44:43.595 --> 03:44:45.876]  Get a diagnosis of a mental disorder.
[03:44:45.876 --> 03:44:50.219]  Take a drug that will rip your brain circuits apart.
[03:44:50.219 --> 03:44:52.940]  And we'll call this healing and a cure.
[03:44:52.940 --> 03:44:58.684]  And we'll say that you are now no longer a danger to the community.
[03:44:58.684 --> 03:45:00.385]  And isn't it wonderful?
[03:45:01.360 --> 03:45:12.409]  Let's just get down on our hands and knees and pray and thank to these people who are watching over us.
[03:45:12.409 --> 03:45:13.870]  Yeah.
[03:45:13.870 --> 03:45:15.571]  They're going all the way.
[03:45:15.571 --> 03:45:22.197]  So we have to go all the way and tell them the truth about what they're really doing.
[03:45:22.197 --> 03:45:25.880]  It's mind control, folks, from one end to the other.
[03:45:26.758 --> 03:45:29.200]  That's what's down the rabbit hole.
[03:45:29.200 --> 03:45:36.724]  And waking up from that, and seeing it, and saying, no, that's the whole point.
[03:45:36.724 --> 03:45:39.866]  Because waking up is contagious, too.
[03:45:39.866 --> 03:45:42.828]  Just like going under a trance is contagious.
[03:45:42.828 --> 03:45:48.611]  You get sleepwalkers on the street, and after a while, your person looks around and says, well, maybe that's normal.
[03:45:48.611 --> 03:45:50.292]  Maybe that's what I should do.
[03:45:50.292 --> 03:45:54.455]  No, but when people start waking up, you begin to say, maybe that's what I should do, too.
[03:45:55.245 --> 03:45:55.985]  You bet.
[03:45:55.985 --> 03:45:58.087]  Go do the research for yourself.
[03:45:58.087 --> 03:46:02.709]  Look up the Frank Church hearings in the 1970s in Congress.
[03:46:02.709 --> 03:46:07.692]  Only one small little slice of what MKUltra was all about.
[03:46:07.692 --> 03:46:09.213]  One little slice.
[03:46:09.213 --> 03:46:11.594]  And it was exposed at that time.
[03:46:11.594 --> 03:46:15.156]  Go look at the history of Ewan Cameron in Canada.
[03:46:15.156 --> 03:46:18.118]  Jose Delgado, the Yale researcher.
[03:46:18.118 --> 03:46:19.979]  Go look at all that stuff.
[03:46:19.979 --> 03:46:21.720]  And check it out for yourself.
[03:46:21.720 --> 03:46:22.260]  And you'll see.
[03:46:23.479 --> 03:46:27.984]  Google in sometime documents MKUltra and see what you can come up with.
[03:46:27.984 --> 03:46:33.590]  Read John Mark's book, Search for the Manchurian Candidate.
[03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:37.154]  Read Walter Bauhardt's book, Operation Mind Control.
[03:46:37.154 --> 03:46:40.879]  Read Alan Sheflin's book, The Mind Manipulators.
[03:46:40.879 --> 03:46:42.881]  When I interviewed John Marks in the early 1990s,
[03:46:45.939 --> 03:46:51.562]  He said to me, do you want to know how I got to be able to write the book that exposed MKUltra?
[03:46:51.562 --> 03:46:53.543]  Because that was really the book that did it.
[03:46:53.543 --> 03:46:55.644]  I said, yeah, I really would.
[03:46:55.644 --> 03:46:57.785]  I mean, how did you get the information?
[03:46:57.785 --> 03:47:03.549]  He said, well, I was sending in FOIA requests for years to the CIA, and they were denying me every time.
[03:47:03.549 --> 03:47:13.374]  And then somebody finally, as a joke, sent me some financial records from MKUltra projects at the CIA, like, hey, let's see what this guy will do with that.
[03:47:15.815 --> 03:47:27.440]  But Marx is a very smart guy, and so he went to work on these records, and he found that he could begin to work out through the funding mechanisms what the projects were really all about, and who was involved.
[03:47:27.440 --> 03:47:32.782]  The researchers, the scientists, the mad, lunatic doctors and psychiatrists.
[03:47:32.782 --> 03:47:36.984]  And then he began to do interviews, and he pieced the whole thing together.
[03:47:36.984 --> 03:47:37.724]  And he wrote the book.
[03:47:39.358 --> 03:47:54.290]  And those other two books that I mentioned were also basically stemmed from those ten boxes of financial records that the CIA finally sent to John Marks as a joke.
[03:47:54.290 --> 03:47:56.712]  So, Marks went back.
[03:47:56.712 --> 03:47:59.714]  He went back to the CIA and he said, OK boys, I want some more.
[03:47:59.714 --> 03:48:01.555]  I'm going to file some more requests.
[03:48:01.555 --> 03:48:04.037]  And here, this is what Marks told me.
[03:48:04.037 --> 03:48:06.299]  This is almost verbatim.
[03:48:06.299 --> 03:48:07.040]  They said to him,
[03:48:08.275 --> 03:48:20.707]  In 1962, the mind control program of the CIA, MKUltra, was shifted over to a different department at the CIA called the Office of Research and Development, ORD.
[03:48:20.707 --> 03:48:24.631]  That's where all the secret research has been going on since then.
[03:48:24.631 --> 03:48:25.192]  And now,
[03:48:26.104 --> 03:48:27.845]  They were taunting Marx.
[03:48:27.845 --> 03:48:30.467]  We've got a hundred boxes of information.
[03:48:30.467 --> 03:48:32.348]  And guess what, Marx?
[03:48:32.348 --> 03:48:35.651]  You're never, ever going to get your hands on them.
[03:48:35.651 --> 03:48:38.292]  You can file as many FOIA requests as you want.
[03:48:38.292 --> 03:48:42.615]  You're never going to get one iota of that information ever again.
[03:48:42.615 --> 03:48:43.436]  Why?
[03:48:43.436 --> 03:48:44.797]  Because what we're doing now
[03:48:47.085 --> 03:48:48.085]  What?
[03:48:48.085 --> 03:48:49.906]  It's more secret than ever.
[03:48:49.906 --> 03:48:52.387]  Therefore, it's more destructive than ever.
[03:48:52.387 --> 03:48:56.588]  Therefore, it's more effective than ever at being mind control.
[03:48:56.588 --> 03:48:58.769]  That's what the CIA was all about.
[03:48:58.769 --> 03:49:03.731]  That's what it became instantaneously as soon as it was created.
[03:49:03.731 --> 03:49:07.612]  It's the mind control agency.
[03:49:07.612 --> 03:49:10.273]  And that's what's happening all across America.
[03:49:11.224 --> 03:49:17.953]  So it's very easy to tell the American people, well, see, Al-Qaeda is this thing out there, way out there.
[03:49:17.953 --> 03:49:20.916]  I mean, we don't even know how to spell it, right?
[03:49:20.916 --> 03:49:22.458]  Is it A-L-Q-U?
[03:49:22.458 --> 03:49:25.021]  Is it A-L-Q-A-I?
[03:49:25.021 --> 03:49:26.063]  Who knows, you know?
[03:49:26.403 --> 03:49:28.024]  We don't know what any of those names mean.
[03:49:28.024 --> 03:49:30.165]  It's way out there somewhere.
[03:49:30.165 --> 03:49:32.807]  They do all the damage on the planet.
[03:49:32.807 --> 03:49:35.669]  And every time something bad happens, they're responsible.
[03:49:35.669 --> 03:49:41.252]  Only thing is, we're funding it.
[03:49:41.252 --> 03:49:42.613]  We created it.
[03:49:42.613 --> 03:49:45.815]  We created part of it during the Afghan war way back there.
[03:49:45.815 --> 03:49:46.536]  Remember?
[03:49:46.536 --> 03:49:47.536]  Yeah, I remember.
[03:49:48.857 --> 03:49:49.697]  That's what Al Qaeda is.
[03:49:49.697 --> 03:49:52.999]  And that's why Alex ran the headline, Obama is the head of Al Qaeda.
[03:50:17.523 --> 03:50:20.805]  Because through various cutouts like NATO and the U.S.
[03:50:20.805 --> 03:50:25.228]  military and so forth, where do you think the funding is coming from?
[03:50:25.228 --> 03:50:26.969]  It's coming from here.
[03:50:26.969 --> 03:50:28.390]  It's coming from us.
[03:50:28.390 --> 03:50:33.514]  It's coming from other places like us, too.
[03:50:33.514 --> 03:50:38.957]  To keep the pot boiling, to destabilize other countries, to destroy
[03:50:39.952 --> 03:50:41.292]  Other economies.
[03:50:41.292 --> 03:50:45.914]  To bring in even worse governments than those countries are now.
[03:50:45.914 --> 03:50:48.995]  Governments that are more under our control.
[03:50:48.995 --> 03:50:51.055]  That are following our agenda.
[03:50:51.055 --> 03:50:59.358]  Which is ultimately... He'll be back with John Rappaport and The Conclusion.
[03:50:59.358 --> 03:51:00.198]  I'm Alex Jones.

[03:53:39.855 --> 03:53:40.636]  This capitalism?
[03:53:40.636 --> 03:53:46.920]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[03:54:27.122 --> 03:54:33.384]  John Rappaport back, sitting in for the last half hour of the Alex Jones Show for Alex.
[03:54:33.384 --> 03:54:38.206]  Let me leave you with just a few thoughts.
[03:54:38.206 --> 03:54:45.029]  When Alex walked onto Piers Morgan's set, you were there too, watching, right?
[03:54:45.029 --> 03:54:46.489]  Everybody was there.
[03:54:46.489 --> 03:54:49.250]  Oh, they were going to have a discussion about gun control.
[03:54:49.250 --> 03:54:54.693]  But it didn't turn out to be quite what CNN thought it was going to be.
[03:54:54.693 --> 03:54:55.453]  It was as if
[03:54:57.239 --> 03:54:58.380]  Follow me here.
[03:54:58.380 --> 03:55:11.706]  It was as if some guy walked onto the set and put his hand out and tore down one of the walls, thus exposing the control room and the cameras and the people standing around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes.
[03:55:11.706 --> 03:55:14.308]  Then he went over and he tore down another wall.
[03:55:14.308 --> 03:55:19.070]  And then you saw office with some people sitting around, you know, playing computer games and so forth.
[03:55:19.070 --> 03:55:23.953]  In other words, the whole illusion was shattered.
[03:55:23.953 --> 03:55:24.613]  That's what happened.
[03:55:25.424 --> 03:55:28.147]  That's what you have to understand.
[03:55:28.147 --> 03:55:40.781]  That if you're going to go up against the mind controllers, and the media are right in there with the CIA in their own way, on the whole program of mind control, count on it all the time, 24-7.
[03:55:40.781 --> 03:55:47.448]  If you're going to go all the way against those people, you have to destroy the illusion.
[03:55:49.249 --> 03:55:51.590]  Well, I always like to have a dialogue.
[03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:52.411]  Would you sit down?
[03:55:52.411 --> 03:55:53.751]  Oh, certainly.
[03:55:53.751 --> 03:55:57.213]  Listen, Mr. CIA, is it true that you've done harmful things?
[03:55:57.213 --> 03:56:03.716]  Well, we may have made a few mistakes, my friend, over the years, but all in all, it's been a clean program.
[03:56:03.716 --> 03:56:04.197]  Yeah, sure.
[03:56:04.197 --> 03:56:05.497]  Right.
[03:56:05.497 --> 03:56:09.800]  No, you have to destroy the illusion that is being presented.
[03:56:09.800 --> 03:56:11.200]  And that's what Alex did.
[03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:16.523]  He sat down, three words got out of Piers Morgan's mouth, you know, kind of like, and then pow!
[03:56:19.406 --> 03:56:21.928]  Let me tell you what gun control is actually all about.
[03:56:21.928 --> 03:56:24.029]  Zam, zam, zam, zam, zam.
[03:56:24.029 --> 03:56:32.635]  And the host, of course, who always has the option of interrupting the guest, somehow, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, did not work.
[03:56:32.635 --> 03:56:33.696]  Wow!
[03:56:33.696 --> 03:56:35.217]  What's going on here?
[03:56:35.217 --> 03:56:38.139]  Morgan is trying to, oh, oh, oh, it doesn't work.
[03:56:38.139 --> 03:56:40.261]  Alex just keeps on boring into him.
[03:56:40.261 --> 03:56:42.422]  On and on and on and on.
[03:56:42.422 --> 03:56:47.566]  Destroying the illusion, not just of the conversation,
[03:56:48.462 --> 03:57:05.147]  But the broadcast, the network CNN, the set on which all this is happening, Piers Morgan, the whole friggin' illusion is going up in smoke in front of your eyes as you're sitting there watching this.
[03:57:05.147 --> 03:57:11.529]  Man, I just ran out and got more popcorn and sat there and said, look at this!
[03:57:11.529 --> 03:57:13.550]  Look what's happening!
[03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:16.231]  He's destroying the entire illusion.
[03:57:17.386 --> 03:57:19.587]  That's what we have to do, folks.
[03:57:19.587 --> 03:57:21.807]  That's what we are doing.
[03:57:21.807 --> 03:57:25.349]  That's what Alex is doing every day on the radio show.
[03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:26.389]  That's what he's doing.
[03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:27.850]  I mean, if you want to know.
[03:57:27.850 --> 03:57:30.050]  Destroying the illusion!
[03:57:30.050 --> 03:57:43.675]  And the illusion, obviously, is, uh, we speak the truth, we give you the best, we're trying hard, you know, all of the... And then on top of that, you put that major media glaze
[03:57:44.679 --> 03:57:47.060]  This is Brian Williams on NBC News Tonight.
[03:57:47.060 --> 03:57:49.942]  For our top story we go to Benghazi.
[03:57:49.942 --> 03:57:53.924]  Reporting... What are you seeing on the ground there?
[03:57:53.924 --> 03:57:57.465]  Well, Brian... Man, they're going all over the planet!
[03:57:57.465 --> 03:57:59.526]  And it's all very smooth back in the studio.
[03:57:59.526 --> 03:58:03.988]  Yes, folks... The tone... People go into a trance.
[03:58:03.988 --> 03:58:04.409]  Oh, yes.
[03:58:04.409 --> 03:58:05.729]  This is the story.
[03:58:05.729 --> 03:58:06.770]  Yes, yes.
[03:58:06.770 --> 03:58:09.571]  Got to break the illusion!
[03:58:09.571 --> 03:58:12.613]  That's why... I'm promoting Alex...
[03:58:14.878 --> 03:58:17.440]  Jay Leno's Fly On Tonight Show.
[03:58:17.440 --> 03:58:19.141]  That's all it'll take, folks.
[03:58:19.141 --> 03:58:21.143]  Forget about Jimmy Fallon.
[03:58:21.143 --> 03:58:22.544]  Come on.
[03:58:22.544 --> 03:58:27.988]  Alex, and I'll be his sidekick, and I'll sit there and pretend I'm drunk like Ed McMahon.
[03:58:27.988 --> 03:58:29.109]  Think about it, folks.
[03:58:29.109 --> 03:58:34.212]  You've got to go all the way with the truth, and you've got to destroy the illusion.
[03:58:34.212 --> 03:58:35.273]  Ten seconds left.
[03:58:35.273 --> 03:58:36.194]  Thank you, Alex.

[03:58:40.757 --> 03:58:42.899]  Destroy the illusion.
