[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:16.446]  A Senate committee passed a media shield law this week that essentially allows the government to determine who is a real journalist for the purposes of protection.
[00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:32.157]  Based on the bill, a real journalist is someone who works or worked for an entity or service that shares news or information by means of a newspaper, wire service, a news agency or via a magazine or through television or radio broadcast.
[00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:40.563]  These people would have to have the primary intent to investigate events and procure material in order to share that information with the public.
[00:00:41.084 --> 00:00:43.345]  Opinion journalists might not be covered.
[00:00:43.846 --> 00:00:45.627]  Senator Feinstein worried the S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:53.673]  law would provide special privileges to those who are not reporters at all, saying those who don't receive a salary couldn't be considered real reporters.
[00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:54.794]  Now the S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:59.478]  law is very careful to distinguish real journalists from those who shouldn't be protected.
[00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:09.769]  This means bloggers and citizen journalists, unless they can prove to the government that at the inception of their information gathering process, their sole intent was to inform the public.
[00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.598]  The bill explicitly excludes protection for those whose principal function is to publish primary source documents that haven't been authorized.
[00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:23.639]  This means no WikiLeaks cables, no NSA leaks, just a rampant, unchecked government.
[00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:32.161]  This is in direct violation of the Constitution, which prohibits the making of any law abridging the freedom of speech or infringing on the freedom of the press.
[00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:33.601]  Doesn't the S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:39.942]  law actually abridge the freedom of speech of citizen journalists by intimidating them with the threat of prosecution?
[00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:41.062]  And the S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:45.783]  law also says they're going to protect real journalists from having to reveal their sources.
[00:01:46.403 --> 00:01:52.226]  So I guess the Fifth Amendment is only there to protect IRS officials who have committed criminal acts and perjury?
[00:01:52.706 --> 00:02:00.630]  What is actually happening here is the government is trying to take a fundamental right and turn it into a government-granted privilege.
[00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.293]  A privilege that can be revoked by them for any reason that they deem necessary in the future.
[00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:07.714]  They created the S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:13.061]  law to protect journalists, but only the journalists that they decide are worthy of protection.
[00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:13.642]  The S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:21.311]  law actually bypasses the First and Fifth Amendment by giving a virtual driver's license to those the government deems worthy of free speech.
[00:02:21.932 --> 00:02:30.378]  Basically, this shield law only protects the corporate media, and not citizen journalists who aren't willing to regurgitate the same government-vetted stories.
[00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.941]  It's not protection at all, but prior constraint.
[00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:42.587]  And even if you are a real journalist, like Michael Hastings, if you get a little too controversial, you'll be investigated by the FBI.
[00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:47.551]  So why is the Obama administration so vigorously attacking the alternative press?
[00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:50.273]  It's because the mainstream media is dead.
[00:02:51.124 --> 00:02:54.927]  The authentic media is winning the war for the minds of the people.
[00:02:55.407 --> 00:03:02.273]  That's why the Obama administration is protecting its lapdog journalists while instilling fear in those that might dare ask questions.
[00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:05.956]  Obama's hired even more journalists to be a part of his team.
[00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:17.064]  Up to 19 journalists from influential outlets like ABC, CNN, The Washington Times and LA Times are going to work for the very administration they should be holding accountable.
[00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:27.108]  So don't expect any of those journalists to report on their bosses' debacles like Obamacare or the illegal NSA spying and wiretapping or Benghazi.
[00:03:27.748 --> 00:03:37.971]  Maybe Obama needed more journalists on his Transforming America team for the big rollout of government-funded news after the recent repeal of the domestic propaganda ban.
[00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:41.692]  Those journalists can now use their talent to influence public opinion.
