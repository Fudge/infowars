[00:00:08.348 --> 00:00:11.550]  A Utah woman claims that the flu shot killed her son.
[00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:13.872]  After he got the shot, he got violently ill.
[00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:19.076]  Lori Webb says her son, 19-year-old Chandler Webb, was the picture of perfect health.
[00:00:19.556 --> 00:00:26.141]  However, the day after his first ever flu shot, he became very ill and was in a coma within 24 hours.
[00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:31.965]  While at the hospital, Chandler underwent a variety of tests, but doctors couldn't confirm what caused his illness.
[00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.806]  The doctors did everything they could as far as trying to detect this.
[00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:41.248]  The one thing they didn't really focus on until the very end and another doctor was the flu vaccination.
[00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:47.530]  Chandler's family ultimately elected to take him off life support and he died after 28 days in the hospital.
[00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.133]  The Utah Department of Health commented that they have no evidence of the flu vaccine or any other vaccine causing this type of outcome.
[00:00:56.653 --> 00:01:00.516]  Tell that to 19-year-old Olivia Maylor and her sister, 20-year-old Madeline.
[00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:05.920]  They're suing the makers of the HPV vaccine, claiming the drug caused their early infertility.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.986]  The sisters say the Gardasil vaccine caused their ovaries to stop producing eggs, leading to premature menopause marked by insomnia, night sweats, and headaches.
[00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:17.748]  They almost certainly won't be able to get pregnant.
[00:01:18.248 --> 00:01:20.610]  In a statement, the vaccines maker Merck & Co.
[00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.935]  says evidence doesn't support a relationship between the condition and the vaccine.
[00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:37.367]  Gardasil is recommended as a routine vaccination for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26, even though the FDA says HPV usually clears on its own without causing any health problems.
[00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:54.540]  But even with serious risks associated with the vaccine, including seizures, stroke, potentially fatal allergic reactions, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and death, the Gardasil campaign still heavily pressures women and their mothers into getting the vaccine as if it was the only answer to avoiding cancer.
[00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:56.762]  I could be one less.
[00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:59.790]  One less statistic.
[00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.890]  One less.
[00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:02.291]  Gardasil.
[00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:03.131]  Gardasil.
[00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:03.792]  Gardasil.
[00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:04.512]  Gardasil.
[00:02:04.612 --> 00:02:08.975]  With Gardasil, you could be one less.
[00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:15.879]  Constance Couch was just nine years old when her life was drastically altered after taking Gardasil.
[00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.841]  Couch was an athletically and academically excelling student considered gifted by her teachers.
[00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:24.924]  During her annual checkup, her doctor vaccinated her with Gardasil.
[00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:27.185]  A week later, she got sick.
[00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:34.869]  Seizures, headaches, weakness, and after spending three months in the hospital, Constance's world was transformed forever.
[00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.420]  And I had to learn how to walk again.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.783]  According to statistics from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, between June of 2006 through May 2013, there have been almost 43,000 adverse reactions from the HPV vaccine.
[00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:12.553]  More than 1,100 reports of permanent disability, including 25 reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome, from May 2009 to 2010 alone.
[00:03:12.913 --> 00:03:15.756]  There have also been 210 reports of death.
[00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:20.601]  Surprisingly, if Gardasil is given to someone who's already been exposed to one of the 100 strains of HPV,
[00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:26.906]  The potential for contracting the human papillomavirus actually increases by 46%.
[00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:40.494]  And after filing a Freedom of Information Act earlier this year, Judicial Watch found that the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has awarded nearly $6 million to HPV vaccine damaged victims.
[00:03:40.994 --> 00:03:46.878]  Even with all of these facts, parents who choose not to vaccinate their children are met with harsh criticism and shaming.
[00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:53.361]  Every year a new article claims that deadly diseases are making a comeback due to the anti-vaccine movement.
[00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:58.963]  And this recent CVS article says parents who don't vaccinate are putting other children at risk.
[00:03:59.123 --> 00:04:10.508]  The LA Times calls for doctors to quit presenting vaccination as a choice and to be more assertive in promoting the potentially life-saving vaccination of young children while avoiding pointing out the risks.
[00:04:11.223 --> 00:04:17.425]  When we look at vaccinations, this country vaccinates children at a rate higher than anywhere in the entire world.
[00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:24.147]  They get something like 46 different antigen exposures before they start school.
[00:04:25.647 --> 00:04:29.849]  They're getting 26 to 30 by age 1.
[00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.691]  Now, I've made the case in a number of articles I've published in Peer Review Journal.
[00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:40.137]  That this is very harmful to the brain.
[00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:42.937]  I've outlined the mechanism by which it does it.
[00:04:44.338 --> 00:04:51.720]  And yet, the policy continues, and every day we see the federal government pushing more vaccinations.
[00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:59.223]  In collusion with the pharmaceutical companies that are making high profits off of it, international organizations are pushing it.
[00:05:00.106 --> 00:05:01.567]  And you have to ask why.
[00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:05.789]  There's only two choices you have in this debate.
[00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:16.814]  Either they're incredibly stupid and incompetent, or criminal, or they're doing it on purpose for a reason, which goes back to the Rockefeller design of human engineering.
[00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:21.856]  Before you feel pressured into vaccinations, ask your doctor for the package insert.
[00:05:22.336 --> 00:05:26.799]  And do your own research to decide if vaccinations are right for you and your family.
