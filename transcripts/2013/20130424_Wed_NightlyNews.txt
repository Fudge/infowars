[00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:23.661]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:29.665]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:35.429]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.731]  It is a big idea.
[00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:39.813]  A new world order.
[00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:45.944]  It was almost as if it were a planned imposal.
[00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.006]  It's just pancakes.
[00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:54.232]  Either you're with us, or you're with the terrorists.
[00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:12.966]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:18.582]  Guns will be taken.
[00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:19.663]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.164]  We're gonna take all of them.
[00:01:21.204 --> 00:01:26.008]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:27.489]  Global governance at last.
[00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:28.529]  Is it one world?
[00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:29.971]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:33.733]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:37.796]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:41.139]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:53.509]  And welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:54.890]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.153]  It is April 24th, 2013, and we're going to go right into it.
[00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:04.398]  Top story, headline, Turmaline attended CIA-sponsored workshop.
[00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:07.660]  Now, this is one of the telltale signs of a false flag.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.487]  You have a Patsy, you have a trigger man who attended a CIA or FBI event, and this man attended a CIA workshop.
[00:02:16.107 --> 00:02:16.548]  Turmaline,
[00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:17.568]  I think so.
[00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:49.868]  He spent six months in Dagestan, a region neighboring Chechnya.
[00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:55.693]  The FBI interviewed him the previous year, but said it found no evidence that he was a threat.
[00:02:56.093 --> 00:03:01.678]  On Tuesday, Homeland Security boss Janet Napolitano said her agency was aware of the trip.
[00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:12.867]  But she didn't think it was that big of a deal, just like she didn't think it was a big deal that the Saudi national with the supposed terror threat was kicked out of the country for having a terror threat, even though
[00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:15.208]  He was at the Boston bombing.
[00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.109]  I don't know why you wouldn't think that's a big deal.
[00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.210]  But yeah, here it is.
[00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.672]  The guy attended a CIA camp.
[00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:29.517]  We heard the mother and some other people talking about he was contacted by various alphabet agencies before and after the Boston bombing.
[00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:30.858]  People are acting like that has
[00:03:31.338 --> 00:03:51.959]  Nothing to do with anything and I'm not saying I'm not jumping the gun like many of these other mainstream Organizations and saying hey these guys did this and they did that and I know this for a fact I don't know that for a fact, but I do believe this article is accurate saying that he was in a CIA sponsored workshop So definitely keep that under your hat and we see people like Salon and other people trying to link him to Alex Jones
[00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.980]  Because he likes InfoWars.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.201]  His aunt likes InfoWars.
[00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:57.603]  You like InfoWars because you're watching it right now.
[00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:04.529]  But for some reason, if you watch InfoWars, it's a conspiracy website and it has fictional information.
[00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.490]  No, it has real information.
[00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.973]  We don't get everything right all the time, but the difference is that we do try.
[00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.015]  We don't fabricate stuff like pulling
[00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:20.238]  Empty backpacks out of empty backpacks like some other news organizations do but we'll give you more on this story as it develops in the coming weeks.
[00:04:20.578 --> 00:04:28.602]  Meanwhile his brother is still in the hospital with a throat wound that he didn't have when he climbed out of the boat and then he had a tracheotomy and now he can't talk but he's still confessing to a crime.
[00:04:29.162 --> 00:04:29.963]  Even though he can't talk.
[00:04:30.523 --> 00:04:31.483]  I'm sure they have something.
[00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:33.565]  Some law is being broken right there.
[00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:34.325]  I'm confident of it.
[00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:35.966]  We'll move on to our next article.
[00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:36.967]  Chambliss.
[00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:41.689]  Law enforcement agency may have known about Boston bombing in advance.
[00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.010]  Let's take a look.
[00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.972]  This is Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss.
[00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:55.077]  There now appears to may have been some evidence that was obtained by one of the law enforcement agencies that did not get shared in a way that it could have been.
[00:04:56.197 --> 00:05:01.362]  If that turns out to be the case, then we have to determine whether or not it would have made a difference.
[00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:06.246]  He told the local news agency there, he said, somebody may have dropped the ball.
[00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:09.768]  And if somebody did drop the ball, we definitely have to get to the bottom of that.
[00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:17.595]  Because it's a very serious issue when you have a bad agency that actually has information and withholds it.
[00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:23.617]  And meanwhile they want to be quick to blame some people just like in a 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
[00:05:23.977 --> 00:05:32.359]  The Patsy who actually cooked the bomb had enough sense to keep record of his interactions with the FBI and that's the only thing that really saves his bacon from the fire.
[00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.280]  But for more on this we go to a special report from David Knight.
[00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:48.755]  Three days after the Boston bombing, the FBI held a press conference and asked the public to help them find two suspects that we now know were the Tsarnaev brothers.
[00:05:49.755 --> 00:06:06.043]  The FBI had no idea who these people were, yet it subsequently came out that they had been contacted by Russian intelligence in 2011 about the older brother, that the FBI had investigated him and cleared him, and that the State Department denied him citizenship based on that past questioning.
[00:06:07.062 --> 00:06:12.232]  And the mother said she was contacted by the FBI about her son, and that they contacted him frequently.
[00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:16.841]  Yet, they had no idea who these guys were in the photographs.
[00:06:17.605 --> 00:06:20.706]  Today we are enlisting the public's help to identify the two suspects.
[00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:26.567]  These images should be the only ones, and I emphasize the only ones, that the public should view to assist us.
[00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:32.489]  For more than 100 years, the FBI has relied upon the public to be its eyes and ears.
[00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.311]  Next question please, next question.
[00:06:40.451 --> 00:06:45.332]  With the media's help, in an instant, these images will be delivered directly into the hands of millions around the world.
[00:06:46.252 --> 00:06:50.774]  We know the public will play a critical role in identifying and locating these individuals.
[00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:57.697]  After initially criticizing the FBI for shoddy work, Lindsey Graham said it really wasn't their fault at all.
[00:06:58.377 --> 00:07:00.137]  It was all due to a spelling error.
[00:07:00.318 --> 00:07:02.338]  You know, those weird foreign names.
[00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:04.539]  You know, like Qaddafi.
[00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:13.783]  Well, it's amazing that they were ever able to even find Muammar Qaddafi, since his name shows up in the press in 112 different variants, according to ABC News.
[00:07:14.648 --> 00:07:16.452]  Is the FBI really that incompetent?
[00:07:17.034 --> 00:07:18.236]  They needed your help.
[00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:21.744]  And they didn't want you to look at any pictures besides theirs.
[00:07:23.072 --> 00:07:25.013]  Are they really worse than Keystone cops?
[00:07:25.834 --> 00:07:28.715]  Should you surrender your liberties and let them burn the Constitution?
[00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:30.797]  The ball was dropped in one of two ways.
[00:07:30.857 --> 00:07:39.802]  The FBI missed a lot of things is one potential answer, or our laws do not allow the FBI to follow up in a sound, solid way.
[00:07:40.302 --> 00:07:42.864]  To be made safer by these Keystone cops?
[00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:45.625]  Or maybe they're not stupid and incompetent.
[00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:48.127]  Maybe they're crazy like a fox.
[00:07:49.113 --> 00:07:53.958]  They were monitoring him and I know that because I used to talk to them.
[00:07:53.998 --> 00:07:55.140]  They used to come to our house.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:09.595]  The other alternative is that they knew all along and contrived events to create, train, support, and ultimately blame a lone wolf terrorist and his younger brother so they could make themselves look good, justify the astronomical sums of money being poured into homeland defense.
[00:08:10.276 --> 00:08:10.596]  I'm good.
[00:08:22.864 --> 00:08:31.611]  If you find it at all credible that the FBI and Homeland Security knew nothing about the Sarnia brothers, then it is laughable to give up any of your liberties for security.
[00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:34.573]  For the InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:08:35.313 --> 00:08:41.918]  If you'd like to get a free digital copy of our InfoWars magazine, just go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:44.120]  It's a great way to spread the truth.
[00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.282]  Alright, thanks for that report, David.
[00:08:49.302 --> 00:08:49.923]  That was pretty good.
[00:08:49.943 --> 00:08:54.786]  He had Lindsey Graham and McCain as those goofy-looking cops, and that's pretty much what they are.
[00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:57.088]  They're just, a lot of these guys, they're jokes.
[00:08:57.208 --> 00:09:01.772]  Lindsey Graham has famously said, and I keep repeating it, you're an enemy combatant, you don't get a lawyer.
[00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:03.994]  And that's what the narrative is.
[00:09:04.054 --> 00:09:06.396]  So, great job to David Knight on that report.
[00:09:06.436 --> 00:09:07.777]  We'll move on to our next article.
[00:09:08.137 --> 00:09:14.482]  Now, this is Obama to ban importation of ammo, magazines, and accessories without congressional approval.
[00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:18.963]  You know, he doesn't need congressional approval to launch his kinetic actions and so to speak.
[00:09:19.303 --> 00:09:23.565]  So I'm not surprised at all that he wouldn't need congressional approval for this.
[00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:24.285]  Let's take a look.
[00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:29.526]  What the UN Arms Trade Treaty passed without media fanfare by 154 countries
[00:09:31.747 --> 00:09:33.207]  We'll skip down past that big block of
[00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:53.613]  That big quote down there.
[00:10:12.896 --> 00:10:13.296]  So that is
[00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:30.521]  We're good to go.
[00:10:52.612 --> 00:10:53.895]  Now we'll move on to this article.
[00:10:53.915 --> 00:10:56.640]  Dan Badondi, rock star Dan Badondi.
[00:10:57.101 --> 00:11:00.407]  Secret Service tried to block press from bombing questions.
[00:11:00.747 --> 00:11:03.192]  Now those who may be new viewers, you can see it right there.
[00:11:03.232 --> 00:11:04.274]  That is the governor.
[00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:05.811]  Right there, yeah.
[00:11:05.972 --> 00:11:09.034]  You can see him right there making that goofy looking face.
[00:11:09.074 --> 00:11:15.378]  That is a face after being asked a question by Dan Bodondi, the guy's dumbfounded.
[00:11:15.398 --> 00:11:30.008]  Can't believe that somebody would dare ask a real question like, why were the loudspeakers telling people not to freak out and telling everybody to stay calm before the bomb went off, but then there were no bombs or, you know, there was no bomb drill.
[00:11:30.268 --> 00:11:32.110]  And you can see the guy right there in that OTS.
[00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.651]  Yeah, that's the guy right there.
[00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:39.695]  The guy in the purple tie who, if we scroll down, we can see him hanging out with Obama as well.
[00:11:39.715 --> 00:11:40.776]  Yeah, we'll keep scrolling down.
[00:11:40.816 --> 00:11:42.157]  That's a good look at his face right there.
[00:11:42.497 --> 00:11:45.820]  And you can see him, there he is right there, behind President Barack Obama.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.805]  So it has led to speculation by many people, including myself, this guy may be Secret Service or some other higher up, some type of Fed.
[00:11:53.085 --> 00:11:55.747]  So actually, now let's go to that piece from Dan Bodondi.
[00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:19.826]  Sir, can you address the pictures today in newspapers all over the country, including the New York Post, that identified two men as potential suspects?
[00:12:38.872 --> 00:12:43.961]  I'm just wondering what it does to your investigation when things like this get out and these guys are wrong.
[00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:44.402]  Thank you.
[00:12:44.422 --> 00:12:49.210]  I think I addressed that question when I saved it by saying, you know, we have this photo that you should get for sure.
[00:12:51.158 --> 00:12:55.561]  InfoWars.com, we're aware of your lies, we're going to expose your lies.
[00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:57.062]  The world is aware of false flags.
[00:12:57.182 --> 00:12:58.023]  We're not afraid.
[00:12:58.063 --> 00:12:59.964]  We've got a constitutional right.
[00:13:00.004 --> 00:13:01.685]  We know about the false flags.
[00:13:02.586 --> 00:13:03.647]  We're aware of it.
[00:13:03.727 --> 00:13:04.467]  InfoWars.com.
[00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:06.549]  He's an American citizen.
[00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:07.870]  That's right.
[00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.671]  We still have a constitution.
[00:13:19.306 --> 00:13:25.370]  Um, they go on Infowars.com, you see contractors, private contractors, folks, with black backpacks.
[00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.711]  Show them the rooftop photos.
[00:13:26.751 --> 00:13:29.072]  They were on the rooftops, they were all over the bomb scene, folks.
[00:13:29.092 --> 00:13:30.633]  So you're saying these are the suspects?
[00:13:30.773 --> 00:13:30.853]  Yes.
[00:13:31.073 --> 00:13:32.394]  The three suspects on the roof.
[00:13:32.454 --> 00:13:35.356]  These are contractors hired by our own government, folks.
[00:13:35.756 --> 00:13:38.197]  Right here, Infowars.com, you can see the pictures.
[00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:39.158]  Those are lies.
[00:13:39.178 --> 00:13:40.919]  They deported the Saudi guy right away.
[00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:43.180]  The Saudi suspect was deported right out of there.
[00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.482]  They're not telling you the truth, folks, they're lying.
[00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.484]  Well, that was my first time seeing that video.
[00:13:52.564 --> 00:13:53.824]  Dan was pretty bold.
[00:13:53.864 --> 00:13:57.085]  He was talking right into that guy's face, that Secret Service guy.
[00:13:57.486 --> 00:14:00.867]  And actually, after this break, after this segment, I'll have Dan Bodondi on.
[00:14:00.887 --> 00:14:04.728]  We did a pre-taped interview earlier today, so stay tuned after our break for that.
[00:14:04.748 --> 00:14:05.409]  That was great.
[00:14:05.529 --> 00:14:07.029]  Let's go, Dan!
[00:14:07.049 --> 00:14:08.330]  Alright, we'll move on now.
[00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:14.192]  Women mistakenly shot at in Christopher Dorner Manhunt get $4.2 million.
[00:14:14.452 --> 00:14:16.933]  And I will say, those women deserve every penny.
[00:14:17.313 --> 00:14:19.635]  The only problem with this, you know, it's taxpayer money.
[00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:20.916]  The women still deserve it, though.
[00:14:21.257 --> 00:14:28.183]  But meanwhile, you know, I really wish they had taken out the paychecks of the guys who, you know, were shooting like cowboys at these two women.
[00:14:28.203 --> 00:14:29.324]  So let's take a look here.
[00:14:29.684 --> 00:14:43.517]  The city of Los Angeles will pay $4.2 million to the women injured when the police mistakenly opened fire on their truck during the manhunt for Christopher Dorner, a disgruntled ex-LAPD police officer who killed four people in a rampage.
[00:14:44.037 --> 00:14:52.201]  Now, keep in mind, they opened fire on two women driving a truck that did not match the description of Christopher Dorner's truck.
[00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:58.965]  So let's say, you know, I can't remember what their particular make and model was, but let's say you're driving a Ford, you know,
[00:14:59.685 --> 00:15:03.431]  A Ford Ranger and the suspected truck was a Chevy Silverado.
[00:15:03.491 --> 00:15:09.761]  But they open fire on you and you're like, hold on, I'm not even driving the same truck that this guy was allegedly driving.
[00:15:10.081 --> 00:15:12.866]  So the ladies get their settlement, the $4.2 million.
[00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:14.368]  I do believe it still has to be
[00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.469]  Approved by the City Council.
[00:15:16.489 --> 00:15:17.670]  I'm sure the City Council will.
[00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:22.090]  Because just the, uh, if they take this to trial, it's going to be a very expensive trial.
[00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.191]  So I'm pretty sure the ladies will get the money that they deserve.
[00:15:25.531 --> 00:15:32.352]  And hopefully it'll keep the LAPD from just shooting at random at people who don't even match the description vaguely.
[00:15:32.893 --> 00:15:33.533]  We'll move on now.
[00:15:33.893 --> 00:15:34.913]  American Free Press.
[00:15:35.353 --> 00:15:38.594]  UK Bilderberg 2013 meeting confirmed.
[00:15:38.634 --> 00:15:39.874]  And I love that graphic.
[00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:41.675]  No peasants allowed.
[00:15:41.695 --> 00:15:43.076]  That's pretty much how these people act.
[00:15:43.456 --> 00:15:44.556]  So let's take a look right here.
[00:15:45.237 --> 00:15:56.302]  An email reply to the AFP, that's the American Free Press, from a Grove staffer in a check of the hotel website's calendar confirmed the hotel is booked solid June 5th through 9th.
[00:15:56.683 --> 00:16:02.506]  The Bilderberg meeting itself, by all the latest indications, is to take place June 6th through 9th.
[00:16:02.926 --> 00:16:06.828]  So if you're in the area, I hope that you are, if you're a listener out there,
[00:16:07.368 --> 00:16:08.449]  Go out there and check it out.
[00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:10.950]  It's going to be June 6th through 9th.
[00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.052]  These are the latest numbers that we have available.
[00:16:14.132 --> 00:16:19.435]  So if you're interested in going to the Bilderberg meeting, definitely look at hotels locally around that area.
[00:16:19.715 --> 00:16:21.976]  I'm sure they'll fill up pretty fast if they haven't already.
[00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:23.117]  So go out there.
[00:16:23.157 --> 00:16:24.277]  Let your voice be heard.
[00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:25.858]  We're going to try to get out there at some point.
[00:16:26.158 --> 00:16:28.480]  I'm pretty sure Paul and Joshua Watson's going to be there as well.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.420]  So we'll see.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.482]  I'm sure InfoWars will be there in full effect.
[00:16:32.862 --> 00:16:34.005]  To the best of our abilities.
[00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:40.102]  I'm not sure if Alex will make it out this year, but we'll have somebody out there besides Paul Joseph Watson, so definitely be aware of that.
[00:16:42.011 --> 00:16:53.660]  People kept criticizing us because we said the things that happened in Boston were going to be used to take our liberties and bring in a police state, well, bring in a stronger police state, and that's exactly what we see with this next article.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.282]  Police state measures at Kentucky Derby.
[00:16:56.622 --> 00:17:00.125]  Now, I'm not one to brag and say I told you so, but we did.
[00:17:00.405 --> 00:17:07.931]  We're warning you about this, because I even saw on SportsCenter, on ESPN, they had the two guys sitting up there, the anchor guy, I can't remember their names.
[00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:14.175]  And they're like, yeah, Janet Napolitano says we need to have more security at these events or more bombs are going to go off.
[00:17:14.536 --> 00:17:15.136]  So there you go.
[00:17:15.156 --> 00:17:16.977]  They're ushering it in quite nicely.
[00:17:17.278 --> 00:17:20.480]  Let's take a look at the things that they want to ban and check and all this.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:32.648]  Backpacks, duffel bags, large purses, coolers, camcorders, tripods, cameras with detachable lenses and numerous other items will now be prohibited at the annual event that seats 50,000 people.
[00:17:32.688 --> 00:17:33.029]  That's 50,000 a day.
[00:17:33.069 --> 00:17:33.469]  In addition,
[00:17:36.371 --> 00:17:41.133]  Fans will be subjected to an electronic wand search according to the Associated Press.
[00:17:41.573 --> 00:17:46.295]  Attendees may also have their cell phones, tablets, and other electronic devices searched.
[00:17:47.236 --> 00:17:48.016]  So think about this.
[00:17:48.316 --> 00:17:49.357]  You have the Boston bombing.
[00:17:49.377 --> 00:17:50.217]  The bomb goes off.
[00:17:50.497 --> 00:17:55.099]  You have several people with cameras, cell phones, and what have you around the immediate area.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.761]  Their devices are immediately confiscated.
[00:17:58.101 --> 00:17:59.221]  What was on those devices?
[00:17:59.321 --> 00:17:59.621]  I don't know.
[00:17:59.721 --> 00:18:01.582]  I don't even know if the people ever got their cameras back.
[00:18:01.902 --> 00:18:02.503]  So, you know,
[00:18:03.323 --> 00:18:06.045]  Heaven forbid there's some type of incident at the Kentucky Derby.
[00:18:06.425 --> 00:18:10.087]  Now you'll have less cameras to catch the suspect, but that's okay.
[00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:13.269]  They don't care if you don't have a camera because they want more cameras.
[00:18:13.289 --> 00:18:26.377]  I was just watching one of the major networks out here on the TV we have in the break room, and the lady's walking around, the anchor or the reporter, and she's like, yeah, I'm walking around Boston, and I'm just very concerned that we don't have any more cameras out here.
[00:18:26.637 --> 00:18:29.199]  If we had more cameras, we could see everything that was going on.
[00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:37.445]  Well, you had plenty of cameras, civilian cameras, police cameras and what have you, and you still don't have a single image out yet.
[00:18:37.645 --> 00:18:39.886]  Have you guys seen an image of these guys placing a bomb?
[00:18:39.946 --> 00:18:40.247]  Anybody?
[00:18:40.607 --> 00:18:41.367]  I haven't seen one.
[00:18:41.387 --> 00:18:42.928]  As far as I know, Alex hasn't seen one.
[00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:47.832]  I haven't seen anything of these two guys who supposedly placed the bombs, placing the bombs.
[00:18:48.152 --> 00:19:06.390]  But the FBI is telling me and they're telling you that don't look at any other images because these guys placed a bomb even though we don't have footage of them placing the bomb and you know one guy's dead, one guy had a tracheotomy laying up in the hospital bed, but we suspect because we suspect we have no actual evidence that this actually took place.
[00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.553]  That's the justice system in the United States of America.
[00:19:11.214 --> 00:19:14.338]  Jordan opens airspace for Israeli drones.
[00:19:14.818 --> 00:19:18.663]  Now I want to keep in mind, I'll just read the last section of this before we even get into it.
[00:19:19.144 --> 00:19:22.468]  There has been no official confirmation from any other source.
[00:19:22.488 --> 00:19:24.751]  So keep this in mind when we go into this article.
[00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:32.220]  Jordan has opened two corridors of its airspace to allow unmanned Israeli drones through to monitor the situation in Syria.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:38.527]  The French newspaper La Friago, I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, reported on Sunday.
[00:19:39.068 --> 00:19:42.152]  The report, based on an interview with a Western military source,
[00:19:42.712 --> 00:19:43.293]  We're good to go.
[00:19:43.313 --> 00:19:43.533]  I think?
[00:19:59.042 --> 00:20:01.423]  Have a better hand on it than we do here in the states.
[00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:04.245]  So let's move on to our last subject of the night.
[00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:09.488]  And this is DuPont Abbott investors vote on GMO resolutions.
[00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:10.148]  Let's take a look here.
[00:20:10.528 --> 00:20:22.815]  DuPont shareholders today will vote on a resolution on genetically engineered seeds while Abbott Laboratory shareholders Friday will ask the company to remove remove GMOs from its infant formula
[00:20:23.175 --> 00:20:24.696]  I don't think you're ever going to get that turn out.
[00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:45.043]  So if you have young children, definitely be aware that the GMO is in their baby formula.
[00:20:45.423 --> 00:20:46.263]  And it's not just for the kids.
[00:20:46.303 --> 00:20:52.305]  I mean, it's in many other products, not just GMOs, but BPAs and other things that are harmful to your bodies.
[00:20:53.205 --> 00:20:54.665]  Vaccines, many other things.
[00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:56.026]  You know, educate before you vaccinate.
[00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.966]  I see those big billboards even here in Austin.
[00:20:58.446 --> 00:20:59.547]  Educate before you vaccinate.
[00:20:59.587 --> 00:20:59.947]  Please do!
[00:21:00.487 --> 00:21:09.137]  When you do take the time to educate yourself, I'm sure you will find that these vaccines contain things like mercury, your GMOs have all kinds of weird stuff.
[00:21:09.157 --> 00:21:10.479]  They got the GMO rats.
[00:21:10.839 --> 00:21:16.166]  We've shown you several times these rats eat the GMO, then they get all sick and get all these tumors and stuff on them.
[00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:17.807]  So I definitely hope that
[00:21:18.488 --> 00:21:25.033]  Abbott will vote to get this stuff out of the baby formula, and if you are taking Similac, definitely be aware that it has GMO in it.
[00:21:25.173 --> 00:21:33.058]  It's, you know, it's a very serious thing, and educate before you GMO your little baby, just like they want your baby to drink the fluoridated water.
[00:21:33.078 --> 00:21:34.760]  I saw that recently when I went to Walgreens.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.663]  Fluoridated water has a little smiling baby with a pink background, and, you know, everybody's happy about it.
[00:21:39.703 --> 00:21:43.466]  I'm not happy about it, but I guess the guys who make the money are happy about it.
[00:21:43.806 --> 00:21:46.007]  Now that brings us to the end of our news portion.
[00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:48.588]  Let's go to our quote of the day from James Madison.
[00:21:49.368 --> 00:21:52.189]  All men having power ought to be mistrusted.
[00:21:52.509 --> 00:21:53.649]  That's from James Madison.
[00:21:54.089 --> 00:21:56.630]  So that does it for this section of the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.252]  I will be back, as I said earlier, with Dan Badandi on the other side.
[00:22:00.692 --> 00:22:05.753]  But in the meanwhile, if you like this broadcast, go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get yourself a 15-day free trial.
[00:22:05.773 --> 00:22:09.035]  There's a lot of great stuff waiting for you right there on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:09.475 --> 00:22:10.255]  You can see it right there.
[00:22:11.244 --> 00:22:16.307]  Alex Jones, the Alex Jones Radio Show, the nightly news, special reports, movies, rants, all the good stuff.
[00:22:16.888 --> 00:22:19.590]  We had some pretty popular rants here recently.
[00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.272]  People had some good comments on those on YouTube.
[00:22:23.532 --> 00:22:24.833]  So definitely check those out as well.
[00:22:25.113 --> 00:22:27.715]  So we'll be back right after this break with Dan Pedanti.
[00:22:33.408 --> 00:22:48.494]  The important thing about the Pro-1 filter today is that the material we use for removing fluoride and other heavy metals now will remove the latest form of fluoride called hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:54.416]  There's no other fluoride reduction filter out there that will remove that type of fluoride.
[00:22:54.796 --> 00:22:56.417]  It's extremely important because
[00:22:57.137 --> 00:23:02.240]  Today we're hearing more and more cities are using that form of fluoride.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.722]  We've been having medication forced on us through the water system for quite a while.
[00:23:05.762 --> 00:23:07.342]  Most people don't realize it.
[00:23:07.382 --> 00:23:10.284]  Most people don't realize the negative effects of fluoride.
[00:23:10.344 --> 00:23:15.847]  There's a wide range of health effects that are attributed to fluoride.
[00:23:16.147 --> 00:23:19.809]  Bottom line, why should somebody get this new Pro-1 Pro-Pure filter?
[00:23:20.794 --> 00:23:36.489]  The reason to buy the Pro-1, it's an all-in-one filter, it's convenient, easy to use, it doesn't require the add-on fluoride filter, and in addition, this filter removes the latest form of fluoride called hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:23:43.348 --> 00:23:49.313]  I'm Darren McBreen and these are some of the new items that are available now at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:23:49.453 --> 00:23:54.878]  Alert the public to Obama's blatant abuse of power with the new Obama t-shirt.
[00:23:54.998 --> 00:23:58.701]  Obama's joker face on the front and come and take it on the back.
[00:23:58.861 --> 00:24:02.844]  It's time to publicly call him out for what he is, a tyrant.
[00:24:02.925 --> 00:24:06.788]  Defend the second amendment with our top seller come and take it t-shirts.
[00:24:06.888 --> 00:24:11.031]  And look at that, women's cut tank tops and t-shirts now available.
[00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:11.652]  Nice hat.
[00:24:11.932 --> 00:24:14.054]  Plus, the Don't Tread On Me flag.
[00:24:14.074 --> 00:24:18.156]  And now, you can become a micro-distributor of the Info Wars magazine.

[00:24:31.686 --> 00:24:37.690]  It gets rid of all pathogenic bacteria, cysts, fluoride, heavy metals, and numerous other contaminants.
[00:24:39.427 --> 00:24:42.925]  So join the revolution at infowarshop.com
[00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:52.870]  And welcome back.
[00:24:53.211 --> 00:24:56.092]  Our guest tonight is our East Coast correspondent, Dan Badondi.
[00:24:56.112 --> 00:24:57.693]  A lot of people have been asking questions.
[00:24:57.974 --> 00:24:59.354]  You know, I want to be like Badondi.
[00:24:59.374 --> 00:25:01.116]  I'm actually hearing people say that now.
[00:25:01.396 --> 00:25:02.476]  I want to be like Dan Badondi.
[00:25:02.496 --> 00:25:03.217]  I want to go in there.
[00:25:03.237 --> 00:25:04.778]  I want to confront the FBI.
[00:25:04.798 --> 00:25:05.898]  I want to confront the governor.
[00:25:06.239 --> 00:25:07.359]  I want to confront the whoever.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.780]  And that's what you need to do.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.362]  You don't have to necessarily be as aggressive as Dan is.
[00:25:11.422 --> 00:25:14.544]  If you're that bold, if you're as bold as Dan or Alex, that's great.
[00:25:14.584 --> 00:25:17.686]  If you're not, he'll give you a few tips on how you can conduct yourself well.
[00:25:17.926 --> 00:25:19.487]  So he joins us now via video Skype.
[00:25:19.827 --> 00:25:21.028]  All right, thanks for joining us, Dan.
[00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:25.056]  Not a problem, Ja'Kari, and what a wild week it was, man.
[00:25:25.356 --> 00:25:26.116]  Yeah, okay.
[00:25:26.136 --> 00:25:36.700]  We're going to talk all about that, but first we have this clip of you at the FBI press conference, and you have your photos, and you're actually blocked by some people we believe to be Secret Service, so let's take a look at that clip.
[00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:50.595]  We got photographs on Infowars.com, folks, of contractors, private contractors that were at the site of the bombing, right here.
[00:25:50.695 --> 00:25:55.478]  Are both suspects seen finding these devices at the finish line?
[00:26:01.881 --> 00:26:10.512]  Sir, can you address the, uh, there are pictures today in newspapers all over the country, including the New York Post, that identified two men as potential suspects.
[00:26:10.933 --> 00:26:16.500]  I'm just wondering what it does to your investigation when things like this get out and these guys are on the streets.
[00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:17.982]  Thank you.
[00:26:18.002 --> 00:26:26.271]  I think I addressed that question in my statement by saying that we have physical photos that should be officially relied upon in this investigation.
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.681]  We're aware of their lies.
[00:26:35.721 --> 00:26:37.922]  We're going to expose their lies.
[00:26:37.942 --> 00:26:39.923]  The world is aware of false flags.
[00:26:39.943 --> 00:26:40.523]  We're not afraid.
[00:26:40.563 --> 00:26:42.204]  We've got a constitutional right.
[00:26:42.244 --> 00:26:43.785]  We know about the false flags.
[00:26:43.825 --> 00:26:44.506]  We're aware of it.
[00:26:44.546 --> 00:26:45.426]  Infowars.com.
[00:26:45.466 --> 00:26:46.647]  He's an American citizen.
[00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:47.908]  We still have a constitution.
[00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:57.408]  They go on Infowars.com and see contractors, private contractors, folks, with black backpacks.
[00:26:57.428 --> 00:26:58.769]  Show them the rooftop photos.
[00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:59.709]  They were on the rooftops.
[00:26:59.729 --> 00:27:01.110]  They were all over the bomb scene, folks.
[00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.770]  So you're saying these are the suspects?
[00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.870]  Yes.
[00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.411]  The three suspects on the roof.
[00:27:04.491 --> 00:27:07.752]  These are contractors hired by our own government, folks.
[00:27:07.812 --> 00:27:09.353]  Right here, Infowars.com.
[00:27:09.393 --> 00:27:10.233]  You can see the pictures.
[00:27:10.473 --> 00:27:11.174]  Those are lies.
[00:27:11.214 --> 00:27:12.954]  They deported the Saudi guy right away.
[00:27:12.974 --> 00:27:15.235]  The Saudi suspect was deported right out of there.
[00:27:15.815 --> 00:27:17.016]  They're not telling you the truth, folks.
[00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:17.516]  They're lying.
[00:27:19.255 --> 00:27:24.758]  Okay Dan, we just saw in that clip you were at the press conference and you get blocked by, I saw at least two guys.
[00:27:24.798 --> 00:27:26.019]  How many guys do you think it was?
[00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:33.423]  I mean, I seen about three or four guys that came right up to me, including one of the high police officers.
[00:27:33.443 --> 00:27:38.726]  I don't know what rank he was, but I mean, they came right up to me right away and you know, they didn't want this information to be seen.
[00:27:38.746 --> 00:27:40.527]  In fact, you get the pictures right here.
[00:27:41.708 --> 00:27:43.469]  These are the very pictures that I was shown.
[00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:45.790]  Yeah, try to hold that steady, Dan.
[00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.251]  Your Skype's breaking up a little bit.
[00:27:47.491 --> 00:27:54.435]  But we also have the images on InfoWars.com, if we can pull up that article so people can see these two gentlemen.
[00:27:54.595 --> 00:27:57.616]  We have pictures of two different gentlemen, and we'll scroll down.
[00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.477]  We see the governor right there, but we'll scroll down.
[00:27:59.537 --> 00:28:00.818]  You can see right there on your screen.
[00:28:01.318 --> 00:28:06.105]  There's one of the guys, and you see another bald guy right next to him, and we'll keep scrolling down.
[00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:11.332]  And Dan, you can see Dan Badandi right there if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:28:11.612 --> 00:28:17.119]  And you can see the same guy at the press conference sitting right behind President Barack Obama.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:31.346]  So, I'd definitely say that this guy has it in good with the Secret Service or at least some type of elite protection service, most likely the Secret Service, but he could be something else, maybe some type of FBI or ATF or whatever else.
[00:28:31.867 --> 00:28:37.169]  So, Dan, we just saw the images and the guy is clearly sitting behind President Barack Obama.
[00:28:37.189 --> 00:28:38.870]  Do you think he is a Secret Service agent?
[00:28:39.604 --> 00:28:40.305]  Most likely.
[00:28:41.046 --> 00:28:44.729]  He's definitely something, because you don't sit behind a president.
[00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:48.352]  He was giving me this evil eye, him and the other gentleman next to him.
[00:28:48.832 --> 00:28:50.814]  That's when I said, you know, I'm not afraid of you people.
[00:28:51.134 --> 00:28:51.975]  I looked him right in the eye.
[00:28:51.995 --> 00:28:52.756]  I still point my finger.
[00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:53.657]  I'm not afraid of you people.
[00:28:54.077 --> 00:28:55.338]  And he goes, well, you should be.
[00:28:55.618 --> 00:28:56.859]  I mean, we're not afraid of you either.
[00:28:56.899 --> 00:28:59.642]  And I said, well, you better be afraid of truth and liberty, because it's coming your way.
[00:29:00.463 --> 00:29:02.044]  And you people are going to jail for murder.
[00:29:02.745 --> 00:29:03.806]  And I was just like,
[00:29:05.107 --> 00:29:06.028]  And I'm let down.
[00:29:06.108 --> 00:29:09.532]  I mean, I stood up against these criminals and so, you know, I said, you know what, we're here for truth.
[00:29:09.873 --> 00:29:11.775]  So Dan, okay, let me get this straight.
[00:29:12.215 --> 00:29:14.358]  He spoke to you and said that you should be afraid.
[00:29:14.418 --> 00:29:15.299]  Is that accurate?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.762]  Oh no, he said we're not afraid of you either.
[00:29:17.862 --> 00:29:18.383]  Okay.
[00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:19.724]  The gentleman next to him said that.
[00:29:20.575 --> 00:29:28.161]  Can you just give me this, you know, the old Secret Service stare, like, we're unstoppable, invincible, you know, I'm like, yeah, you're a joke, you know?
[00:29:28.181 --> 00:29:34.326]  Yeah, you sit behind the president in a purple tie and, you know, you think you're Mr. Tough Guy.
[00:29:34.346 --> 00:29:41.231]  Okay, Dan, so for our new viewers who may not be aware, you know, of your whole situation, break down for us briefly.
[00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:45.675]  So you go to Boston after the bombing at the Marathon, and then what happened from there?
[00:29:46.516 --> 00:29:54.599]  Well, the first press conference, I basically asked them about the drills that was reported by Local 15, I believe.
[00:29:55.219 --> 00:30:06.403]  And the speakers, I think it's the Local 15 or the Boston Globe, I forgot, they were reporting basically about the drills going on that day.
[00:30:06.463 --> 00:30:10.784]  And also, people on the loudspeaker saying, no, it's just a drill, stay calm.
[00:30:10.904 --> 00:30:13.685]  I asked them those questions, and they were quick answer, no.
[00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:18.730]  Then I asked in the second press conference, is this a false flag to take out civil liberties?
[00:30:19.111 --> 00:30:22.575]  And they said, Patrick Duvall, no, next question.
[00:30:22.955 --> 00:30:25.818]  And I get it out again, why are you trying to cover this up?
[00:30:25.999 --> 00:30:28.441]  And I said right now, it's a false flag.
[00:30:29.082 --> 00:30:35.385]  So, Press Conference 3, which was Thursday, basically I got right up in that, you know, saying, hey, I got the photos, you know what I mean?
[00:30:35.405 --> 00:30:38.627]  Who are these contractors in the khaki pants and the khaki boots?
[00:30:38.867 --> 00:30:40.168]  And I was trying to get these questions out.
[00:30:40.508 --> 00:30:44.390]  They were completely whitewashed over me, you know, not even as if I wasn't even there.
[00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:53.115]  And when I held these pictures up here, these glossy 8x10s, you know, that's when they all jumped up, trying to block the pictures, the guy behind me with his clipboard.
[00:30:53.635 --> 00:30:57.357]  But, you know, when the press came swarming over, they all backed off.
[00:30:57.757 --> 00:30:59.218]  No, I just want to say it again, too.
[00:30:59.518 --> 00:31:04.440]  When my friend Nick arrived with these pictures for me, he gave them to me.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.581]  The guy behind me told somebody, and they went into the back.
[00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:10.442]  And they went into the back and said, hey, they've got pictures.
[00:31:11.223 --> 00:31:15.765]  And the coordinator of the conference came out and said that they've got pictures.
[00:31:15.925 --> 00:31:20.667]  I'm sure she came out to say to the press, we're going to delay the press for about five minutes.
[00:31:21.943 --> 00:31:26.517]  And when he did that, you know, they came out right away to say, ignore any other pictures.
[00:31:29.369 --> 00:31:46.342]  Now Dan, I remember that press conference I was on the Alex Jones Radio Show Live with David Knight at that time, and we're watching the press conference live, and we hear him say, don't look at any other picture, and I'm like, there must be several other pictures, if nothing else, of different angles of these two guys, the alleged suspects.
[00:31:46.582 --> 00:31:50.325]  There are plenty of other pictures out there, but look at nothing else except these two pictures.
[00:31:50.345 --> 00:31:51.626]  That was very strange to me as well.
[00:31:54.241 --> 00:31:54.461]  Yeah.
[00:31:54.741 --> 00:31:57.243]  So Dan, I have an article right here if we can do a dot cam.
[00:31:57.563 --> 00:31:58.364]  Shocking footage.
[00:31:58.764 --> 00:32:01.225]  Americans ordered out of their homes at gunpoint.
[00:32:01.565 --> 00:32:06.728]  Now you can see right here in this picture a guy pointing his gun right at the camera, or should I say the cameraman.
[00:32:06.748 --> 00:32:17.635]  And we saw much of this, Dan, not just intimidation like you experienced at the press conferences, but you can see right there on your screen as well the police going house to house, shoving their guns in people's faces.
[00:32:17.675 --> 00:32:20.897]  We also saw the clip of a police officer running down the street.
[00:32:21.877 --> 00:32:26.521]  Showing his gun, you know, jamming his gun into people's faces, you know, trying to intimidate them.
[00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:30.443]  It's a complete police state going out there, but they don't want to call it martial law.
[00:32:30.483 --> 00:32:34.646]  I guess they have some kinetic action phrase or something like that that they want to call it.
[00:32:34.907 --> 00:32:36.588]  So Dan, did you witness any of this?
[00:32:37.432 --> 00:32:43.475]  Oh yeah, I mean I went off to Watertown as well after the press conference and everything.
[00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:45.837]  I went down to Watertown the next day I believe.
[00:32:45.877 --> 00:32:50.819]  It's just been a long week, I'm sorry man, it's just been a long week.
[00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:54.722]  In Watertown they were kicking people out of their homes, not giving them provisions or nothing.
[00:32:55.322 --> 00:32:56.903]  I talked to some of the residents.
[00:32:57.523 --> 00:33:00.504]  And they were kicked out of their homes, not told what was going on.
[00:33:01.264 --> 00:33:05.906]  When they could return, one person asked what the situation was, and they got threatened with arrest.
[00:33:06.666 --> 00:33:12.607]  In Boston, Mass., there was Humvees everywhere, SWAT teams, military.
[00:33:12.668 --> 00:33:18.089]  I was following them with the camera on the military, going in and out of corrals and buildings, into parking lots.
[00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:24.091]  And I was following them with the video camera, getting all this footage of them searching, looking at people's car windows, everything.
[00:33:24.791 --> 00:33:29.778]  And it was a total police state, and it was weird just to be there to witness all this happening.
[00:33:29.798 --> 00:33:30.479]  And I'm like, wow.
[00:33:30.919 --> 00:33:36.246]  And people, you know, they're, you know, they're clapping after, you know, the suspect was caught, you know.
[00:33:36.306 --> 00:33:39.650]  And they're clapping, oh yeah, they did a great job, these heroes.
[00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:41.693]  And Dan, let me ask you this real quick.
[00:33:41.793 --> 00:33:48.720]  We saw a report come out earlier this week talking about how people were generally satisfied with the way the investigation was handled.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:34:00.252]  From the people you talked to, and I know you don't claim to know what 90% of the people are thinking, like President Obama, but from just your general feeling being around Boston and that area, how do you think people perceived the investigation?
[00:34:01.294 --> 00:34:05.936]  Well, when I talk to a lot of people, some people are just nervous about those cops everywhere.
[00:34:05.976 --> 00:34:07.457]  Some people are like, oh, I think it's safe.
[00:34:07.557 --> 00:34:08.337]  I feel safer.
[00:34:08.397 --> 00:34:10.839]  But, you know, they're all over the place.
[00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:16.821]  But, you know, a couple people were skeptical what was going on about the bombs.
[00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:20.823]  And, you know, when I mentioned the drills to them, they're like, wow, I didn't know that.
[00:34:20.843 --> 00:34:21.644]  You know, it made them think.
[00:34:22.524 --> 00:34:23.764]  And, you know, this is all on record.
[00:34:23.824 --> 00:34:26.345]  And, you know, I talked to a lot of different people.
[00:34:26.365 --> 00:34:30.746]  I was on some liberal show Tuesday, the day after the bombing.
[00:34:31.346 --> 00:34:33.586]  And they're, you know, basically trying to discredit everything.
[00:34:33.646 --> 00:34:35.907]  And I'm like, I'm only reporting what you people said.
[00:34:36.467 --> 00:34:37.967]  You know, this is all on record.
[00:34:38.087 --> 00:34:43.569]  You know, and you people throw this media out, then you take it down, and you expect people not to pay attention to it.
[00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:44.329]  Right.
[00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:47.549]  And, you know, it's just, it's mind control, it really is.
[00:34:47.609 --> 00:34:49.830]  And that's what mainstream media is all about, mind control.
[00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:50.931]  Exactly.
[00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:53.254]  Now Dan, I know you're eager to get back out on the streets.
[00:34:53.274 --> 00:34:54.415]  You have more reports you want to do.
[00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:56.358]  So just leave us with your closing comments.
[00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.473]  No, people call me a hero and all that, but you know what?
[00:35:04.553 --> 00:35:07.135]  All that credit goes to God, bottom line.
[00:35:07.776 --> 00:35:12.781]  And I'm just a small man from the smallest city in the smallest state of the country.
[00:35:13.381 --> 00:35:15.223]  And I can make a huge difference.
[00:35:16.044 --> 00:35:17.625]  Alex says the resistance is you.
[00:35:18.226 --> 00:35:19.167]  You are the resistance.
[00:35:19.307 --> 00:35:20.408]  Anybody can make a difference.
[00:35:20.448 --> 00:35:23.250]  Again, I live in the smallest city in the smallest state in the country.
[00:35:24.296 --> 00:35:27.899]  And I went out there and confronted the globalists, and anybody can do this.
[00:35:27.939 --> 00:35:29.920]  And I encourage everybody, don't be afraid.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.081]  That's people's problem.
[00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:32.922]  They're awake, but they're afraid.
[00:35:32.942 --> 00:35:34.603]  You know, these Gestapo people.
[00:35:34.724 --> 00:35:35.604]  Don't be afraid of them.
[00:35:36.065 --> 00:35:37.686]  Because resistance is victory.
[00:35:38.046 --> 00:35:39.267]  Get out there with the video cameras.
[00:35:39.567 --> 00:35:40.267]  You know, people in L.A.
[00:35:40.348 --> 00:35:41.969]  are reporting that they're doing drills right now.
[00:35:42.029 --> 00:35:44.070]  I want people out there with video cameras in Chicago.
[00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.911]  So, get out there with the video cameras.
[00:35:45.952 --> 00:35:46.792]  Confront these people.
[00:35:46.872 --> 00:35:47.693]  Why are you doing the drills?
[00:35:47.733 --> 00:35:48.754]  Go to the press conferences.
[00:35:49.074 --> 00:35:49.794]  Ask the officials.
[00:35:49.834 --> 00:35:50.555]  Get in their faces.
[00:35:50.575 --> 00:35:51.896]  You know, do it nicely, of course.
[00:35:52.756 --> 00:35:53.397]  You want to know why?
[00:35:53.817 --> 00:36:01.880]  Citizenship Journalism is the most important thing because we want to know the real questions.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.960]  We want the real answers.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.601]  Of course, we're not going to give them, but you know what?
[00:36:04.881 --> 00:36:08.142]  It shows that we're standing up against these criminals.
[00:36:08.382 --> 00:36:08.702]  We are.
[00:36:09.122 --> 00:36:10.583]  We're standing up against the New World Order.
[00:36:10.783 --> 00:36:12.783]  And again, I encourage everybody to get out there.
[00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:14.904]  If they're running drills, you get out there with video cameras.
[00:36:14.944 --> 00:36:15.684]  Don't back down.
[00:36:16.465 --> 00:36:17.925]  Get out there and ask the real questions.
[00:36:18.665 --> 00:36:19.086]  All right.
[00:36:19.126 --> 00:36:21.226]  The advice from the man himself, Dan Badandi.
[00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:22.207]  Thanks for joining us, Dan.
[00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:23.147]  Thank you, Jakari.
[00:36:24.597 --> 00:36:28.979]  All right, and there he goes off to wreck another press conference with real questions.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:38.905]  I just didn't know that you could end a press conference by asking real questions that the FBI doesn't hand you beforehand on a cue card, but you know, I guess that's the new system.
[00:36:39.405 --> 00:36:48.850]  Anyway, if you like this broadcast and you want to see it continue, if you want to see guys like Dan out there in the field, that takes a little bit of capital, so I hope you would take the consideration, I should say,
[00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:52.713]  You can get yourself a 15-day free trial.
[00:36:53.013 --> 00:37:01.180]  It supports our broadcast and it has a great archive system for anybody who wants to know more about the InfoWars brand and Alex Jones Show, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.362]  It's all right there on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:03.742 --> 00:37:05.704]  And also, don't forget, there's just a few days left.
[00:37:06.164 --> 00:37:10.568]  Operation Paul Revere, over $100,000 in prizes.
[00:37:10.908 --> 00:37:15.252]  Check it out, InfoWars.com forward slash contest to get your entry in.
[00:37:15.272 --> 00:37:17.394]  There's a lot of great stuff there already, but do not
[00:37:17.894 --> 00:37:20.996]  Be intimidated, you still have time, and who knows?
[00:37:21.036 --> 00:37:25.038]  You know, it doesn't have to necessarily be a certain length or over a certain topic.
[00:37:25.058 --> 00:37:27.239]  Just anything that's great at promoting freedom.
[00:37:27.279 --> 00:37:31.181]  And you can see the three prizes, if we can go back up for just one second.
[00:37:31.622 --> 00:37:33.403]  Yeah, you guys can see it right there on your screen.
[00:37:33.923 --> 00:37:35.004]  Grand Prize, $100,000.
[00:37:35.424 --> 00:37:41.127]  Even if you have to split that with a couple other people, that's still a whole lot of money.
[00:37:41.187 --> 00:37:44.749]  It's a whole lot more than I got paid for the InfoWars reporter contest.
[00:37:45.289 --> 00:37:46.951]  Asked Alex if I could enter this one.
[00:37:46.971 --> 00:37:47.992]  He said no.
[00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:51.435]  So, we have to send it out here at the Info War, but you have a chance to win $100,000.
[00:37:51.856 --> 00:37:55.219]  So definitely take that into serious consideration.
[00:37:55.279 --> 00:38:01.446]  And once again, if you send in a slideshow, you're probably not going to make it, but your slideshow may wake somebody up.
[00:38:01.466 --> 00:38:02.707]  So send it in anyway.
[00:38:03.127 --> 00:38:04.748]  So, with that, I'm Jakari Jackson.
[00:38:04.768 --> 00:38:05.668]  Great job to the crew.
[00:38:05.708 --> 00:38:12.551]  We've been working some long hours here at the Info War with the recent bombing and CISPA and all the other news, the gun news.
[00:38:12.951 --> 00:38:15.973]  So, definitely appreciate you watching us and supporting us here at the Info War.
[00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:18.534]  So, I'm Jakari Jackson, and we'll see you tomorrow night.
