[00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:12.695]  Ladies and gentlemen, just think about how fundamentally wicked these gun grabbers are in trying to get Americans to give up their Second Amendment rights.
[00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:16.198]  The Second Amendment is above the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.662]  It's only enumerated and articulated and guaranteed in that document.
[00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:22.364]  But it's a God-given right.
[00:00:22.744 --> 00:00:25.107]  Self-preservation is the first law of nature.
[00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:29.309]  Every animal will either defend itself or try to evade an attacker.
[00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:36.914]  It is completely instinctual and they want Americans to give up their instincts, to give up their self-defenses, and lay down to government.
[00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:42.777]  Rattlesnakes are not aggressive creatures, but they shake the rattle to warn people, don't you tread on me.
[00:00:43.317 --> 00:00:46.599]  And if they do come, they've got fangs waiting with full of venom.
[00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:54.604]  The colonies adapted that iconic image and put it on the Gadsden flag to remind the British or any tyrants, don't tread on me.
[00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:55.804]  We're going to be peaceful.
[00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:57.125]  We're not going to be aggressive.
[00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:00.187]  But if you do come attack us, we're not going to lay down and take it.
[00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:01.307]  We're going to fight back.
[00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:05.330]  Even the cute hedgehog will curl into a ball to defend itself.
[00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.152]  But Feinstein, Obama and Biden want us to give up our instincts.
[00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:23.338]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:29.180]  Dianne Feinstein says Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, even a single cell organism.
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.823]  I know the sense of helplessness that people feel.
[00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:34.746]  I know the urge to arm yourself because that's what I did.
[00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:56.161]  Teachers shouldn't even consider packing heat to ward off would-be attackers and save the children.
[00:01:56.621 --> 00:02:00.864]  No, lay down, cower in a closet, and wait for the authorities to come save you.
[00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:03.006]  What are you supposed to do when you see the flash?
