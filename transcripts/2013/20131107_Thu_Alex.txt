[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.658]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:14.508]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.210]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.071]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:19.532]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:21.173]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.853 --> 00:00:25.456]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:30.099]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.247]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:39.771]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex, and we have an interesting show today.
[00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:42.934]  I'm going to be joined later in the show by other InfoWars staff.
[00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:45.477]  We're going to have Paul Joseph Watson calling in from England Live.
[00:00:45.517 --> 00:00:50.182]  We've got Anthony Gucciardi, who will be here in the studio, as well as Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:54.006]  And we're going to have an interview later on in the show with Bill Still.
[00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.168]  Now he's a filmmaker, a documentarian.
[00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.111]  He made a film that we carry here at InfoWars, Jekyll Island, and we're going to talk to him about the history of the Fed.
[00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:07.813]  You know, it's coming up to 100 years that they've been doing what they do to us, and we're going to talk about what they do to us.
[00:01:07.853 --> 00:01:14.415]  We're going to talk also about the, it actually goes much longer than 100 years, this kind of oppression from central banks.
[00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:16.857]  Uh, what he talks about in his documentary.
[00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:18.318]  It's a wonderful documentary.
[00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:19.440]  I've seen the entire thing.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:29.229]  And it's, uh, anybody that loves history, anybody that's interested in money, anybody that wants to understand what's going on in this country needs to see this documentary.
[00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:33.874]  We're going to talk to him about the history of money as well as the future of money.
[00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:35.496]  And that's going to be coming up.
[00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:37.475]  Later on in the show.
[00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:39.157]  So we also want to take some of your calls.
[00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:48.986]  We're going to be talking to, as I said, Anthony Gucciardi and Paul Joseph Watson, and we're going to take some of your calls and get some of your comments about special reports they've got coming our way.
[00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:51.862]  Now, we just had an election.
[00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:56.004]  We had, actually, in Texas, we just had our first racist election.
[00:01:56.604 --> 00:01:56.985]  That's right.
[00:01:57.145 --> 00:01:58.765]  We used voter IDs.
[00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:01.127]  Actually, photo voter IDs.
[00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:01.967]  Can you imagine that?
[00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.949]  We actually required people to look at it.
[00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.493]  And the interesting thing is that we actually had about twice as many voters in Texas, even though that was supposed to suppress turnout.
[00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:15.194]  It actually didn't suppress turnout.
[00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:17.595]  We had a lot of voters in Texas show up.
[00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:23.398]  But, uh, you know, showing a photo ID, that's not really a racist thing, is it?
[00:02:24.058 --> 00:02:25.179]  Is that really a racist thing?
[00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:34.845]  The same laws that the Department of Justice, Eric Holder, is coming after Texas as well as North Carolina because they're requiring photo ID.
[00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:40.048]  And yet, they allow it in Indiana and many other states have exactly the same laws.
[00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:42.850]  But they're coming after Texas and North Carolina.
[00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.070]  Why?
[00:02:43.973 --> 00:02:51.524]  Well, they say that because these states are in the South, because they're part of the old Confederacy, that therefore these laws must be racist laws.
[00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:53.267]  It's absolute nonsense.
[00:02:53.327 --> 00:02:56.472]  I can tell you, coming from North Carolina, I had a...
[00:02:57.478 --> 00:03:27.378]  Friend of my brother-in-law's tell him that he went to vote and of course in North Carolina you would in the past just show up and give them a name and an address and they look it up well anybody can look up a name and address in a phone book so you can basically go in and vote the phone book and they give you plenty of time to do it too there's a long it's not just one election day of course that was another reform that we got was extending the election periods not just absentee ballots but you have a very long election period so dishonest person can go in and vote often and vote early as they say
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.934]  Well, my friend went in to vote and he gave them his name and address and they said, you've already voted today.
[00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.690]  He said, no they can't be.
[00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.371]  Oh no, you voted and your, I think it was mother, voted.
[00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:43.011]  She was at the same address and she had deceased.
[00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:46.912]  So, you know, both he and his dead mother had already voted that day.
[00:03:46.952 --> 00:03:50.833]  Now, did he turn that in as a voter fraud complaint?
[00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:51.473]  No.
[00:03:51.873 --> 00:03:53.473]  He didn't have the time to bother with it.
[00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:55.294]  He didn't want to come on the show and talk about it.
[00:03:55.874 --> 00:03:56.694]  That happens though.
[00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:59.514]  But people don't want to take time out of their life to pursue this.
[00:03:59.554 --> 00:04:02.235]  And so, what we hear from the Board of Elections is, well,
[00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:05.096]  It's not really a problem, because it isn't happening.
[00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:05.936]  It is happening.
[00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:07.317]  It's very easy to happen.
[00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.739]  It's not an oppressive thing to have a voter ID.
[00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:15.281]  As a matter of fact, here in Texas, you've got seven choices of photo ID.
[00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:18.983]  Things like a driver's license, a military ID, or a passport.
[00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:25.106]  It's not an oppressive or racist thing to require an ID, a picture ID.
[00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:31.609]  A lot of places require that just to cash a check or to do a transaction in a retail place.
[00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:35.213]  We've also got other election results that are coming in.
[00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:42.142]  You know, I like to call these un-election results, because in an election you get to make a choice, but not in the un-election.
[00:04:42.162 --> 00:04:44.325]  And we're going to talk about that right after the break.
[00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:47.930]  We'll tell you exactly what I'm talking about with an un-election result.
[00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.651]  Stay tuned.
[00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:10.657]  Introducing Pro-1.

[00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:10.524]  I had tried everything.
[00:06:10.584 --> 00:06:12.725]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:15.626]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:20.528]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[00:06:20.888 --> 00:06:27.272]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:06:27.752 --> 00:06:38.197]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:43.100]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:49.464]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:06:49.684 --> 00:06:50.845]  Now that's results.

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.603]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:18.384]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:07:18.484 --> 00:07:18.764]  The U.S.
[00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:22.986]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:25.647]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:07:26.027 --> 00:07:27.288]  They want that attack to come.
[00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:33.691]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:36.555]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:07:36.775 --> 00:07:41.543]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:07:41.743 --> 00:07:49.175]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:07:49.475 --> 00:07:52.037]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:54.880]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.604]  Strategic Relocation the Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:20.729]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.049 --> 00:08:25.396]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:37.155]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:37.235 --> 00:08:39.997]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex, and I love that bumper.
[00:08:40.017 --> 00:08:42.639]  If you haven't seen that, you need to take a look at that on video.
[00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.602]  He did a great job of a retro bumper there.
[00:08:46.222 --> 00:08:52.387]  As well as Alex kind of going into this Pokemon thing that he does there, but not in real life.
[00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.532]  So we were just talking before the break about how we just had our first racist election here in Texas.
[00:08:58.592 --> 00:09:04.795]  That's right, we had voter ID, photo IDs, like you have to show when you're cashing a check in most places.
[00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:11.817]  And everybody said that's going to suppress voter turnout, and yet we had a two-fold increase in voter turnout.
[00:09:12.277 --> 00:09:12.898]  Didn't happen.
[00:09:13.638 --> 00:09:16.801]  And these are the same laws that many other states have.
[00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:22.747]  Indiana, several states in the Northeast have enacted photo ID laws.
[00:09:23.327 --> 00:09:31.835]  And yet in Texas and in North Carolina, Attorney General Eric Holder is coming after those state laws, accusing them of being racist.
[00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:35.299]  And that simply isn't the case, as I mentioned before the break.
[00:09:36.494 --> 00:09:47.343]  I know personally of someone who went to vote in North Carolina when there were no voter ID laws and was told that he had already voted along with a dead relative that lived at the same address.
[00:09:47.403 --> 00:09:52.167]  But you know, I think the real story here is the unelection that is going on.
[00:09:52.627 --> 00:09:55.149]  And we're getting returns from the unelection every day.
[00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:02.275]  Just a couple of days ago we learned that 900,000 people in California were unelected from their health care plan.
[00:10:03.056 --> 00:10:04.117]  They didn't get a choice in that.
[00:10:04.991 --> 00:10:11.134]  Well, now we find out that in Colorado, 250,000 people have been cancelled from their health care plans.
[00:10:11.594 --> 00:10:13.355]  That's kind of the unelection, isn't it?
[00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:15.916]  You know, you were told that you could keep your health care plan.
[00:10:15.956 --> 00:10:18.598]  You had picked out what you wanted to do.
[00:10:18.858 --> 00:10:20.939]  Can't you make a decision about your own life?
[00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:34.503]  We're supposed to be able to make decisions to elect people to rule over us, like kings and tyrants, but we can't be allowed to make decisions about what our health care is going to be, evidently, according to Obama.
[00:10:34.923 --> 00:10:36.684]  That's not really going too well.
[00:10:36.744 --> 00:10:41.007]  He got skewered pretty well at the Country Music Awards last night.
[00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:53.264]  They had a couple of country and western singers, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood, and they quipped, I started signing up last Thursday and I'm almost done.
[00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:56.849]  So, I don't know, that's a pretty good turnaround.
[00:10:56.869 --> 00:10:58.372]  They shouldn't be complaining about that.
[00:10:59.352 --> 00:11:01.874]  We've also kind of got some returns from zombie elections.
[00:11:01.914 --> 00:11:07.937]  We find out that in Washington State, we had two dead candidates are winning their election races.
[00:11:08.858 --> 00:11:12.300]  And I guess that really kind of works if you've got people who are dead voting.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.541]  Wouldn't you expect them to vote for dead candidates?
[00:11:15.782 --> 00:11:17.643]  Come up with a new party, the dead party maybe.
[00:11:18.363 --> 00:11:19.344]  The ungrateful dead.
[00:11:19.384 --> 00:11:22.946]  I guess we're not grateful enough for what Obama's done for us with health care.
[00:11:23.678 --> 00:11:34.286]  Another sad thing that came out of the election results was the $22 million propaganda campaign that Monsanto ran, as Anthony Gucciardi reports on InfoWars.
[00:11:35.106 --> 00:11:42.051]  And basically they outspent the opposition yet again on just an honest labeling campaign for GMO.
[00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.034]  Wouldn't you like to know what's in your food?
[00:11:46.054 --> 00:11:47.976]  Why can't we know what's in our food?
[00:11:49.116 --> 00:11:54.180]  I guess, like laws and sausage, we're not allowed to know what's in our soda pop, either.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:02.666]  We don't want to know what goes in there, because if you knew what went into laws, sausages, and soda pop, you probably wouldn't want to have anything to do with any of those.
[00:12:03.506 --> 00:12:16.576]  And this happens over and over again, that we get outspent, and people are very easily swayed if they're, say, commercial after commercial, obviously.
[00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:28.379]  Mike Adams has a article that he put out after the election talking about that and saying over and over again we're getting taken out at these simple
[00:12:29.522 --> 00:12:50.063]  issues of just letting people know what's in their food and he pointed out that we need to change our strategy it's a very much uh... we're trying to go against these people in their strength we can't out PR them we can't out uh... advertise them and uh... he says we need to go to some kind of an asymmetrical warfare
[00:12:50.743 --> 00:12:57.927]  And he's not talking about actually getting violent, but he's talking about how we need to not... He said the people that are running these campaigns are kind of nice.
[00:12:57.947 --> 00:12:59.968]  There's a lot of areas that they don't really want to go.
[00:13:00.048 --> 00:13:03.951]  And Mike is alluding to something that he's got coming down the road, but...
[00:13:05.006 --> 00:13:15.234]  Just in general, we notice this, that if you've got a bear coming at you, like I've talked about before back in North Carolina, they tell you to throw sticks at the bear.
[00:13:15.454 --> 00:13:17.836]  They tell you to yell and shout at the bear.
[00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:20.078]  They tell you to look aggressive, look big.
[00:13:20.398 --> 00:13:22.520]  They don't tell you to say, nice bear, go away.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.383]  They tell you to get really nice and soft, or to run away from it.
[00:13:26.783 --> 00:13:27.404]  You do that.
[00:13:27.944 --> 00:13:28.445]  You're history.
[00:13:29.085 --> 00:13:31.206]  So you have to basically get in their faces.
[00:13:31.366 --> 00:13:33.848]  The same sort of thing that Alex did on Piers Morgan.
[00:13:34.428 --> 00:13:36.149]  A lot of people liked that.
[00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:40.631]  And of course, there were people who didn't like that because they didn't like what Alex was saying.
[00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:50.097]  But it was a very powerful thing to see someone not just engage in an intellectual debate, but to actually get up and be passionate about freedom.
[00:13:50.857 --> 00:13:51.797]  That's what we need to see.
[00:13:51.837 --> 00:13:53.798]  We need to see people passionate about freedom.
[00:13:54.018 --> 00:13:56.498]  We need to show the effects of GMO.
[00:13:56.538 --> 00:13:59.779]  We need to show these pictures of the rats with massive tumors.
[00:13:59.819 --> 00:14:03.240]  I mean, we need to get tough with this instead of just being nice.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.560]  Sometimes I'm accused of being too nice and too soft on things.
[00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:20.123]  We need people like Alex that are going to get out there and shout with passion and we need to get on that with the GMO because, as I said, they're taking us out because they can outspend us with PR.
[00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:31.957]  Now, along the lines of Obamacare, we have this strange thing of this couple in Brooklyn that are going to get divorced so they can save money, so they can afford health insurance.
[00:14:31.977 --> 00:14:37.899]  You know, I think instead of them divorcing, we need to look at ways that we can divorce Obama.
[00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:41.452]  Or at least go into some kind of a legal separation.
[00:14:42.393 --> 00:14:44.215]  And I think there's people who are coming up with that.
[00:14:44.275 --> 00:14:53.644]  Certainly as far as the NSA stuff goes, we've got a lot of people that are coming up with market solutions to the invasions of privacy that have been going on now.
[00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:58.690]  This was revealed several months ago, and do you see anybody in Congress doing anything about it?
[00:14:59.451 --> 00:14:59.811]  Me neither.
[00:15:00.672 --> 00:15:05.116]  But there are people in the tech community that have been busy about this on a lot of different fronts.
[00:15:05.597 --> 00:15:07.479]  We've got the founder of Lavabit.
[00:15:07.499 --> 00:15:12.484]  Now if you remember, Lavabit was the email provider for Ed Snowden.
[00:15:13.502 --> 00:15:17.706]  And the Feds came to him and wanted encrypted emails that belonged to Ed Snowden.
[00:15:17.746 --> 00:15:21.269]  And rather than turn them over, he shut down his entire service.
[00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.113]  And the same thing happened with Silent Circle.
[00:15:25.153 --> 00:15:26.874]  That was run by Phil Zimmerman.
[00:15:26.914 --> 00:15:28.916]  He's the guy that created PGP.
[00:15:28.936 --> 00:15:30.017]  You may remember PGP.
[00:15:30.057 --> 00:15:31.879]  That's been around a very, very long time.
[00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:35.242]  That's been around since the Internet was in its infancy.
[00:15:35.948 --> 00:15:40.230]  I always found it clumsy to use, and so I never really used PGP.
[00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:52.655]  But both of those services shut down, and now they're looking at coming up with something called Dark Mail, which they believe is going to be a solution to the privacy, to the snooping.
[00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:54.956]  And he had an interesting quote, Levinson did.
[00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:58.258]  He said, if you knew what I know about email, you might not use it.
[00:15:59.537 --> 00:16:08.525]  It's kind of like what I mentioned before, you know, if you know what goes into sausage and into legislation, you wouldn't want to have anything to do with either one of those, as Bismarck said.
[00:16:09.226 --> 00:16:12.729]  Now, he's not only coming up with dark mail, but there's also projects out there.
[00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:24.319]  Cody Wilson, who did the 3D printable gun, has got Dark Wallet, which is a way to keep your anonymity, a little bit stronger protection for your anonymity within Bitcoin.
[00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:29.862]  Because you put things in your wallet, and there are ways that people can discover your wallet.
[00:16:30.223 --> 00:16:37.027]  When the FBI confiscated the coins from Silk Road, when they shut it down, they got about 26,000 coins.
[00:16:37.608 --> 00:16:40.509]  That was identified by someone in the Bitcoin community.
[00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.112]  So now when those coins are spent, you know that they're coming from the FBI.
[00:16:44.232 --> 00:16:45.293]  They labeled that wallet.
[00:16:46.053 --> 00:16:46.533]  Dark Wallet.
[00:16:46.553 --> 00:16:48.154]  So there's ways that they can do that.
[00:16:48.214 --> 00:16:51.855]  If someone makes a connection to you then basically you lose that anonymity.
[00:16:52.215 --> 00:16:55.856]  They're coming up with a new way to keep that private called Dark Wallet.
[00:16:56.096 --> 00:16:58.237]  And of course there's another program you might want to know about.
[00:16:58.357 --> 00:16:59.257]  Safe Slinger.
[00:16:59.557 --> 00:17:06.700]  That's a free text security program that is available for free with iPhone and with Android.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.420]  I've got that.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.081]  That's actually a very interesting program because you basically get
[00:17:10.922 --> 00:17:21.612]  Uh, get with someone in person and you compare things that are on your two phones and you get matches on those two phones and that's the way you set up your, your keys between those two people.
[00:17:21.632 --> 00:17:24.075]  So you're not transmitting anything at all in the clear.
[00:17:24.115 --> 00:17:26.737]  You're kind of doing it there where you're standing next to each other.
[00:17:27.558 --> 00:17:31.882]  The free market is going to come up with solutions to this tyranny and this oppression.
[00:17:31.902 --> 00:17:34.103]  I don't think we're going to see it from the government.
[00:17:34.143 --> 00:17:35.865]  Certainly not going to see it from Washington.
[00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:37.746]  They just keep on doing the same thing.
[00:17:38.207 --> 00:17:43.451]  There's no legislation being brought out by anyone that I'm aware of that's going to rein any of this stuff in.
[00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:46.734]  And every day we get more revelations about what the government's doing.
[00:17:47.074 --> 00:17:51.838]  Today we find from the New York Times that CIA is said to be paying AT&T for call data.
[00:17:52.618 --> 00:17:54.080]  Now here's the interesting thing about that.
[00:17:55.213 --> 00:18:02.217]  What they say is that under a voluntary contract, and not under subpoena, that AT&T is cooperating with them.
[00:18:02.657 --> 00:18:06.360]  So they're not getting subpoenas, they're not getting court orders, they're just doing it voluntarily.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:16.526]  The reason they can do that is because the government maintains the idea that if you give your information to a third party, like to a phone company or to an internet provider,
[00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:22.372]  Then that third party can voluntarily turn over your private information.
[00:18:23.152 --> 00:18:24.293]  And they don't need a search warrant.
[00:18:24.493 --> 00:18:28.055]  In other words, if they were to come directly to you, they would need a search warrant.
[00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:33.117]  But if they get it from somebody that you gave it to, they're saying that they don't need a search warrant.
[00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:42.852]  That's one of the major reasons that they're coming up with CISPA is to give litigation protection to these companies because they've essentially betrayed their trust to you.
[00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:50.376]  Even though they may have it and probably do have it buried somewhere and they're constantly changing terms of and services conditions.
[00:18:51.544 --> 00:18:51.784]  Still,
[00:19:22.184 --> 00:19:23.025]  It just broke today.
[00:19:23.265 --> 00:19:24.626]  This is coming from the Telegraph.
[00:19:25.346 --> 00:19:28.728]  And this is exactly the sort of thing we're seeing.
[00:19:28.788 --> 00:19:32.350]  This is where our hope for privacy lies in the future.
[00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:40.974]  We can't really divorce Obama and these other guys because they're kind of running these crooked elections, but we can get a legal separation.
[00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:44.336]  We can legally move ourselves away from these guys.
[00:19:44.916 --> 00:19:49.159]  And there are a lot of people who are very angry, very upset now that they see these Snowden revelations.
[00:19:49.699 --> 00:19:57.648]  And they're going to keep offering solutions to us in the private sector, where we can get another Internet that's separate from it.
[00:19:57.709 --> 00:20:01.153]  I don't think that the BRICS Internet No.
[00:20:01.173 --> 00:20:06.539]  2 from Russia and China, I don't think that's going to offer any privacy, but we're going to see what happens with these private ones.
[00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:07.260]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:09.148 --> 00:20:13.572]  Every day it becomes more clear our nation is headed towards an uncertain future.
[00:20:13.632 --> 00:20:17.195]  Nothing can ensure your family's security like an Atlas Survival Shelter.
[00:20:17.275 --> 00:20:24.180]  The strongest money can buy and designed to be buried up to 42 feet deep with all the comforts of home and all the protection you need.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.545]  Bulletproof hatches, tamper-resistant air pipes, and a unique ground design that'll withstand a bomb.
[00:20:29.985 --> 00:20:34.629]  See them today at iwantthatbunker.com or call 1-855-4-BUNKER.
[00:20:34.809 --> 00:20:36.230]  Atlas Survival Shelters.

[00:21:14.334 --> 00:21:22.118]  My name's Matt Cook with GetEDSolutions.com, and I've developed a system that often fixes ED from home naturally, without medical intervention.
[00:21:22.358 --> 00:21:22.938]  How does it work?
[00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:26.879]  My system addresses the root cause of most ED, which is desensitization.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.181]  Desensitization is not your fault, but it's the number one reason men get embarrassed around women.
[00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:37.364]  The more they try, the more things don't work, and the solution is to fix desensitization through simple activities you do from home.
[00:21:38.004 --> 00:21:41.685]  I purchased your product yesterday and it was fantastic.
[00:21:41.805 --> 00:21:45.706]  I have used your system for about three weeks and I'm already seeing great results.
[00:21:45.966 --> 00:21:55.809]  If you're one of the 52% of men who suffer from ED, you must visit GetEDSolutions.com for a special report and video that shows you how to fix ED from home fast without pills or supplements.

[00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:06.412]  GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:22:08.382 --> 00:22:13.264]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:22:13.744 --> 00:22:14.925]  What are bitcoins?
[00:22:15.385 --> 00:22:21.447]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:22:21.847 --> 00:22:23.308]  No bank needed.
[00:22:23.668 --> 00:22:28.970]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.151]  You are in control of your money.

[00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:07.370]  We mine your business.
[00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:13.111]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:23:13.491 --> 00:23:21.952]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:23:22.372 --> 00:23:29.674]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:23:30.194 --> 00:23:37.595]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:23:38.095 --> 00:23:41.498]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:23:42.058 --> 00:23:45.700]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:23:46.241 --> 00:23:52.825]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[00:23:53.386 --> 00:24:00.131]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front.
[00:24:00.611 --> 00:24:04.654]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:24:13.345 --> 00:24:21.690]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:34.539]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex and we're going to be joined here at the bottom of the hour with Paul Joseph Watson from England and we're going to be talking about his article today about a guy calling for forced abortions.
[00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:44.566]  But there's a story that's going on here in Texas, and I interviewed the fellow last Friday on the InfoWars Nightly News, Mark Crutcher from Life Dynamics.
[00:24:45.126 --> 00:24:50.010]  They broke this story back in May, and so far nothing has happened with it.
[00:24:50.130 --> 00:25:00.358]  They filmed, let's take a look at what some of these witnesses in an abortion, actually there's a clinic workers that have witnessed live babies being murdered by an abortionist.
[00:25:00.378 --> 00:25:03.040]  They're exactly like the Kermit Gosnell case.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.621]  And let's look at what they had to say.
[00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:06.741]  This is a short clip here.
[00:25:07.861 --> 00:25:09.061]  You see the baby alive?
[00:25:09.562 --> 00:25:10.002]  Yes, sir.
[00:25:10.362 --> 00:25:12.662]  And him kill that baby outside the womb?
[00:25:12.803 --> 00:25:13.203]  Yes, sir.
[00:25:13.943 --> 00:25:18.644]  And this would be done by jamming some sort of instrument into the soft spot?
[00:25:18.784 --> 00:25:22.705]  Either that or actually twisting the head off the neck.
[00:25:23.866 --> 00:25:25.586]  Kind of with his own bare hands.
[00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:26.946]  And you saw that happen?
[00:25:26.986 --> 00:25:27.387]  Yes, sir.
[00:25:27.407 --> 00:25:29.927]  Sometimes he would go through the stomach as well.
[00:25:33.757 --> 00:25:34.579]  Sometimes he would do what?
[00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:36.462]  He would, like, force it through the stomach.
[00:25:37.224 --> 00:25:38.686]  The instrument?
[00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:39.788]  Mm-hmm.
[00:25:40.109 --> 00:25:40.730]  Is it beers?
[00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:41.511]  Like, twist it.
[00:25:41.571 --> 00:25:41.892]  Yeah.
[00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:43.455]  And you saw that?
[00:25:43.635 --> 00:25:43.856]  Mm-hmm.
[00:25:45.303 --> 00:25:47.644]  Anything that he could get to the fastest.
[00:25:48.324 --> 00:25:52.526]  Like she said, the umbilical, he was probably perforating the umbilical cord.
[00:25:53.406 --> 00:26:01.349]  I normally saw either the snipping of the spine or the introduction of the instrument in the soft spot of the fetus, normally.
[00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:02.830]  Or twisting of the neck.
[00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.872]  I remember he would put like his finger... Yeah, or his finger.
[00:26:06.892 --> 00:26:09.373]  He'd take his finger and... Through the throat.
[00:26:09.413 --> 00:26:09.553]  Yeah.
[00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:16.698]  I have watched that several times and I cannot get used to that.
[00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:19.222]  That is...
[00:26:21.095 --> 00:26:26.979]  That is essentially the same thing that Kermit Gosnell was convicted to life in prison for.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:40.168]  And several of his workers, co-workers there at that clinic, and as Life Dynamics has pointed out, if you are a worker in one of these clinics and you don't come forward and put this out there, you are an accessory to murder.
[00:26:40.188 --> 00:26:43.431]  And we've already seen that happen in the Kermit Gosnell case.
[00:26:44.592 --> 00:26:48.895]  Now, this was just a clip of the testimony that they had.
[00:26:48.935 --> 00:26:50.316]  They had the full testimony.
[00:26:51.477 --> 00:26:57.020]  And they sent that to several law enforcement sources so they could see the unedited testimony.
[00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:00.722]  They sent it to the Homicide Division of the Houston Police Department.
[00:27:01.223 --> 00:27:03.204]  They sent it to the Texas Medical Board.
[00:27:03.804 --> 00:27:07.066]  They sent it to the Texas Department of State Health Services.
[00:27:07.566 --> 00:27:09.587]  And they sent it to some state legislators.
[00:27:09.767 --> 00:27:16.391]  And 20 Texas lawmakers sent letters to these people saying that they wanted an investigation.
[00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:19.193]  And yet here we are, about five or six months later.
[00:27:19.233 --> 00:27:19.913]  That was in May.
[00:27:19.993 --> 00:27:20.874]  We're now in November.
[00:27:22.526 --> 00:27:23.588]  Nothing has been done yet.
[00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:27.573]  It's kind of like the Sherlock Holmes story, the dog that didn't bark.
[00:27:28.638 --> 00:27:32.219]  And so the question is, why is there no investigation going on?
[00:27:33.379 --> 00:27:37.941]  There's connections between the mayor of Houston and Planned Parenthood.
[00:27:38.081 --> 00:27:56.666]  Her partner, she's openly homosexual, her partner is very high up in Planned Parenthood and also part of the, there's some issues with campaign finance that I'm not sure if those were vetted out or if they're still under investigation.
[00:27:57.626 --> 00:28:08.308]  But this article, there was a lot of coverage of it in May when it happened because they released this information right after the Gosnell trial and it was picked up by the Daily Mail and others.
[00:28:08.628 --> 00:28:17.970]  The Daily Mail went the headline, Second House of Horror Abortion Clinic where doctor twisted heads off of fetuses and next with his bare hands is investigated in Texas.
[00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.650]  Well it's not clear that it is being investigated in Texas.
[00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.471]  Scroll down to that article guys.
[00:28:22.511 --> 00:28:24.431]  Take a look at this abortion clinic and I've
[00:28:25.586 --> 00:28:30.589]  Every time you see an abortion clinic, this thing is set up, it looks like some kind of a dark prison.
[00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:34.251]  You can look at this on Google Street View, that's what they embedded in the article.
[00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:40.875]  A metal gate around it, a concrete bunker-like building with a few windows.
[00:28:41.155 --> 00:28:45.717]  Most of the time they don't even have windows on the first floor, so you can't see in.
[00:28:46.398 --> 00:28:47.958]  It's a very, very dark thing.
[00:28:49.212 --> 00:28:52.473]  A couple weeks after they put this out, there was a reaction.
[00:28:52.493 --> 00:29:00.236]  Houston Chronicle came out and said, their headline was, Anti-abortion group targets doctor, some call it a witch hunt.
[00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:02.356]  And they had a quote in there.
[00:29:02.376 --> 00:29:05.337]  Now listen to this quote, and consider the source.
[00:29:06.018 --> 00:29:11.199]  This is from Amy Miller, the founder of Whole Woman's Health, which operates five abortion clinics in Texas.
[00:29:11.359 --> 00:29:15.081]  She said, you have to consider the source and the motivations.
[00:29:15.801 --> 00:29:18.462]  You have to know it is a political tool with an agenda.
[00:29:19.531 --> 00:29:24.544]  Amy Miller, who runs five abortion clinics, she wouldn't have any motivations in this, would she?
[00:29:24.705 --> 00:29:25.607]  In calling it a witch hunt?
[00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.395]  She wouldn't have any kind of agenda, would she?
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:42.723]  It's a very, very sick thing, but it's becoming socially acceptable for people to talk about not only abortions, but to talk about forced abortions, forced sterilization.
[00:29:43.423 --> 00:29:51.805]  And we're going to have, we're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson about the article that's on InfoWars today about that and about many other subjects when we come back.
[00:29:52.742 --> 00:29:54.364]  It's something we all need to think about.
[00:29:54.724 --> 00:29:58.628]  And I think when you see a partial birth abortion, you see something like this, it really makes you think.
[00:29:58.648 --> 00:29:59.429]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.929 --> 00:30:01.511]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.452 --> 00:30:05.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.133 --> 00:30:14.715]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:30:14.915 --> 00:30:22.139]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:25.480]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.441]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:30:27.681 --> 00:30:32.263]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.

[00:31:12.545 --> 00:31:17.391]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:31:17.572 --> 00:31:24.741]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:31:24.861 --> 00:31:30.264]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:31:30.504 --> 00:31:34.187]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:44.473]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:31:44.713 --> 00:31:47.795]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:31:47.955 --> 00:31:50.197]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.

[00:33:24.112 --> 00:33:28.295]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:33.413 --> 00:33:34.954]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:35.034 --> 00:33:42.937]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex, and we're joined right now with Paul Joseph Watson from England, one of our InfoWars staff writers.
[00:33:43.037 --> 00:33:46.138]  I'm sure you've read his fine articles that he puts out all the time.
[00:33:46.819 --> 00:33:48.259]  One of the key writers that we have here.
[00:33:48.319 --> 00:33:51.941]  We've got a great staff on the website, as you all know, I'm sure.
[00:33:51.961 --> 00:33:53.021]  Paul, are you there?
[00:33:53.842 --> 00:33:55.142]  Yes, good to be here, David.
[00:33:55.382 --> 00:33:56.723]  Hey, it's nice to talk to you finally.
[00:33:57.563 --> 00:34:00.624]  We've sent emails back and forth, but I've never actually talked to you in the past.
[00:34:02.762 --> 00:34:06.546]  I don't know if you heard this story that I was just talking about that's happening in Houston.
[00:34:07.066 --> 00:34:09.889]  We have another Kermit Gosnell situation.
[00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:16.476]  We've got a doctor who has been accused of his staff of twisting the heads off of babies that are born alive.
[00:34:17.117 --> 00:34:23.904]  And yet here we are about six months after these revelations came out and no investigation is being conducted as far as we know.
[00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.751]  I mean, it's really amazing.
[00:34:27.451 --> 00:34:36.915]  Even the people I talk to who are against abortion, they then either meet people or directly come into contact with hospitals that provide carry-out abortions.
[00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:41.617]  And that turns them anti-abortion simply through seeing the horrific procedures.
[00:34:42.157 --> 00:34:43.918]  Because there's this idea that
[00:34:44.198 --> 00:34:47.100]  You know, people think it's like putting down an animal or something.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:47.780]  It's not.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:53.824]  It's completely horrific if you actually look at the procedures that they have to go through to actually abort babies.
[00:34:53.864 --> 00:34:59.388]  And, you know, in terms of Gosnell and people like him, he kind of drew enjoyment out of it.
[00:34:59.428 --> 00:35:03.351]  And even the people blowing the whistle on him, they were involved in it as well.
[00:35:03.911 --> 00:35:20.326]  Well, now we've got a guy who is a prominent activist, gay rights activist, who appeared on Australian television, and he openly advocated that abortion be made mandatory for 30 years, forced abortion, and I think we've got the clip.
[00:35:20.766 --> 00:35:21.747]  Yeah, let's play that clip.
[00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.534]  Do you each think would have the greatest potential to change the world for the better if it were implemented?
[00:35:30.293 --> 00:35:32.033]  Dan, let's start with you.
[00:35:32.073 --> 00:35:32.873]  Oh my God.
[00:35:32.893 --> 00:35:36.074]  You gotta give us a minute to think about that.
[00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:37.194]  Population control.
[00:35:37.214 --> 00:35:38.714]  There's too many goddamn people on the planet.
[00:35:38.735 --> 00:35:46.176]  I don't know if that's a... You know, I'm pro-choice.
[00:35:46.256 --> 00:35:47.856]  I believe that women should have the right to control their bodies.
[00:35:47.896 --> 00:35:49.676]  Sometimes in my darker moments, I'm anti-choice.
[00:35:49.716 --> 00:35:52.057]  I think abortion should be mandatory for about 30 years.
[00:35:55.878 --> 00:35:56.958]  That's a dangerous idea.
[00:35:56.978 --> 00:35:58.258]  She wanted a dangerous idea.
[00:35:59.528 --> 00:36:00.488]  So throw a chair at me.
[00:36:00.688 --> 00:36:01.989]  That is a very dangerous idea.
[00:36:02.009 --> 00:36:03.529]  I actually have to think about it for a minute.
[00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:05.090]  Wow.
[00:36:06.591 --> 00:36:09.372]  You know, they can talk about that in the abstract, but I've got an idea.
[00:36:09.492 --> 00:36:10.752]  I've got an idea that's pretty dangerous.
[00:36:10.772 --> 00:36:16.974]  So we actually had a revolution over it, that we have a creator that endows us with certain inalienable rights, like life and liberty.
[00:36:17.034 --> 00:36:22.456]  And Jefferson, who wrote that, also said, the God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time.
[00:36:22.476 --> 00:36:24.677]  The hand of force can destroy, but not disjoin them.
[00:36:25.037 --> 00:36:26.638]  You cannot have any freedom
[00:36:27.378 --> 00:36:38.455]  If you're going to allow people to, at some point in time, kill other people, because then you get on the slippery slope as to when you can kill people, when can you euthanize people, when can you abort people.
[00:36:40.421 --> 00:36:47.523]  Well, and, you know, how that is carried out in countries that do provide forced abortion is, again, horrific.
[00:36:47.563 --> 00:36:48.563]  I mean, look at China.
[00:36:48.963 --> 00:36:59.426]  They literally kidnap women off the streets or out of their own beds, beat them up, forcibly drag them to state hospitals, inject them with abortion-inducing drugs.
[00:37:00.206 --> 00:37:02.208]  And they have the forced abortion.
[00:37:02.248 --> 00:37:03.368]  It's completely horrific.
[00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:05.630]  And this is basically what he's calling for.
[00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.432]  And this is not some, you know, guy on the sidelines.
[00:37:08.472 --> 00:37:09.333]  He's quite prominent.
[00:37:09.373 --> 00:37:11.774]  He's got 170,000 followers on Twitter.
[00:37:12.295 --> 00:37:16.338]  He's regularly on HBO Realtime with Bill Maher.
[00:37:16.738 --> 00:37:17.899]  This is a prominent guy.
[00:37:18.639 --> 00:37:25.723]  Imagine the outrage if a prominent anti-abortion activist had called for all homosexuals to be killed.
[00:37:26.243 --> 00:37:28.805]  That would be a massive, massive outrage.
[00:37:29.225 --> 00:37:31.126]  This happened three, four days ago.
[00:37:31.686 --> 00:37:33.647]  Barely a whimper, barely anything.
[00:37:34.428 --> 00:37:37.890]  And we can get into the moral outrage in a minute, but...
[00:37:38.985 --> 00:37:44.209]  It's this notion about overpopulation which again and again we have to restate is a complete myth.
[00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:49.653]  It's a bankrupt argument both scientifically and factually.
[00:37:50.093 --> 00:37:53.996]  The replacement rate for humans is 2.1 children.
[00:37:54.597 --> 00:38:00.241]  If we don't achieve that rate globally then the human population will eventually die out.
[00:38:00.761 --> 00:38:03.623]  Already in half the world we're below 2.1.
[00:38:04.904 --> 00:38:06.585]  I mean look at Europe for example.
[00:38:06.985 --> 00:38:10.787]  Italy is 1.4, Spain 1.48, Germany 1.36.
[00:38:12.548 --> 00:38:18.530]  Even in America it's down to 1.89 which again is below the replacement rate.
[00:38:18.851 --> 00:38:20.531]  A couple has to have 2.1 children
[00:38:22.112 --> 00:38:25.674]  For the replacement rate of human population to be kept stable.
[00:38:25.734 --> 00:38:27.655]  If it's below that, then we're in decline.
[00:38:27.995 --> 00:38:29.575]  And there's a lot of factors that come into that.
[00:38:29.635 --> 00:38:30.956]  It's not just economic factors.
[00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:37.399]  There's also things like pollutants in the water or plastic, BPA, that lower fertility rates.
[00:38:38.885 --> 00:38:39.685]  Well, precisely.
[00:38:39.725 --> 00:38:42.146]  There are a lot of different factors that contribute to it.
[00:38:42.666 --> 00:38:54.751]  The general theme is what they call demographic transition, which is this shift from high birth rate and high death rate, which obviously happened during times of high disease,
[00:38:55.191 --> 00:39:00.032]  To low birth rate and low death rate, which is the phase that we've now definitely shifted into.
[00:39:00.472 --> 00:39:11.895]  So even in countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia, where people think that the population is skyrocketing beyond all control, they're in fact now also falling below the rate of fertility.
[00:39:12.295 --> 00:39:22.837]  And the UN's own figures, this is not InfoWars.com, this is not some right-wing think tank that's come out with these figures, this is the UN Population Fund, their own figures show
[00:39:23.377 --> 00:39:26.619]  World population will get to about 9 billion by 2050.
[00:39:27.099 --> 00:39:29.881]  After that it will start to decline dramatically.
[00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:34.563]  And the problem in the future is going to be underpopulation, not overpopulation.
[00:39:35.084 --> 00:39:44.229]  So any policy or any advocacy based on the justification of preventing overpopulation is completely fraudulent.
[00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:46.590]  And you see in Russia they've figured that out.
[00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:50.132]  They're actually trying to give bonuses to people who have children, Putin is.
[00:39:50.852 --> 00:39:57.276]  But away from that, away from the Malthusian nonsense that's been disproven over and over again, back to the moral issue.
[00:39:58.157 --> 00:40:05.661]  I guess it kind of comes back to the point where it's very easy for somebody to talk about population control in the abstract, because they don't really see what's happening.
[00:40:05.701 --> 00:40:11.165]  As you mentioned, people that you know that have gone to abortion clinics and have seen it, it takes it away from the abstract.
[00:40:11.805 --> 00:40:17.649]  It's kind of like, I think, so many people in the abstract, they're not really worried about the NSA listening to their data, but
[00:40:18.269 --> 00:40:34.404]  You take that situation where Tom Mabe, the comedian, went out with a boom mic and a NSA or CIA type of suit, you know, black suit with sunglasses, and he starts recording people's conversations, standing in front of them with a boom mic, they instantly see that as an offense.
[00:40:35.265 --> 00:40:43.194]  And I think people obviously understand that when these children are born alive, that that's a horrible thing, what was described that this doctor was doing.
[00:40:44.035 --> 00:40:55.349]  And you also see that happening with partial birth abortion, where they would partially take the child, that could survive on its own, and abort the child and call it an abortion because part of the baby is still inside of the mother.
[00:40:55.729 --> 00:41:07.632]  You get into this slippery slope area where are you going to say that it's a murder if the baby is partially inside the mother, if it's totally removed from the mother, if it's full term, at what point do you decide that it's murder?
[00:41:08.392 --> 00:41:09.532]  And that's the problem.
[00:41:09.872 --> 00:41:13.213]  It's kind of the same thing that we see happening in Gitmo.
[00:41:13.233 --> 00:41:16.974]  There was an article today from Russia Today and this fellow was
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.465]  Talking about how he was tortured in Gitmo, and he said it was an area without any laws.
[00:41:23.965 --> 00:41:37.499]  And that's what happens when you give people the capability to torture and to kill, then you've got a situation where it just becomes a situational ethics, where they can change the situation, they can do that to anybody.
[00:41:39.858 --> 00:41:42.519]  Yeah, and its end justifies the means, isn't it?
[00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:49.120]  It's this whole idea of disrespecting life and frowning upon life and thinking that life has no meaning, no value.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:42:03.343]  Which is what happens in China and increasingly in Western countries where you see, you know, babies by the side of the road or young children who have been run over by cars and people just walk past ignoring them as they lie in the gutter bleeding.
[00:42:03.743 --> 00:42:05.083]  That's what it all leads towards.
[00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:27.235]  And it's interesting with this whole overpopulation thing, because, I mean, for example, I was at a safari park here near where I live recently, and they were doing a cheetah demonstration, and it turned out that the actual safari park was involved with David Attenborough, who basically says that humans are a plague, and we should stop feeding the third world.
[00:42:29.136 --> 00:42:31.197]  Yeah, and the Optimum Population Trust.
[00:42:31.617 --> 00:42:41.782]  And they were indoctrinating British children through this Optimum Population Trust to not have kids of their own in order to save the cheaters.
[00:42:42.202 --> 00:42:45.824]  Now, David, how many wild cheaters live in Britain?
[00:42:47.945 --> 00:42:50.606]  You probably saw all of them in that park, didn't you, Paul?
[00:42:51.638 --> 00:42:53.138]  Yeah, that was probably half of them.
[00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:57.760]  But, again, why are they teaching British kids not to have children?
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.400]  To save the cheetahs?
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.041]  How on earth are those two linked?
[00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:13.843]  The decline of cheetah population is due to deforestation, which, coincidentally, a lot of the global warming alarmists are behind with the growing of the biofuel, which is causing massive deforestation.
[00:43:14.304 --> 00:43:15.324]  But they link it to
[00:43:16.044 --> 00:43:32.914]  If, you know, you've got to only have one child, or don't have any children at all in Britain, which also has a fertility rate under 2.1, so we're dying off as well, even with the immigration, they're saying you can't have kids either, to save the cheaters who live in Britain.
[00:43:33.174 --> 00:43:34.354]  They really hammer that there.
[00:43:34.875 --> 00:43:45.158]  I remember taking my family to London about 15 years ago, and going to the Children's Museum, and they had a loop talking about exactly what you're talking about.
[00:43:45.618 --> 00:43:51.380]  A loop, it was essentially the Gaia Theory, you know, where mankind is a virus on the planet's surface.
[00:43:51.961 --> 00:43:58.103]  And they just played this, all these kids are up there playing at the highest level of the floor, they had a play area for the kids.
[00:43:58.863 --> 00:44:11.275]  And they've got this large television set just playing this propaganda film over and over again, telling them that humans are a plague, overpopulation is destroying all the other life forms, and we need to get rid of the humans.
[00:44:11.435 --> 00:44:13.477]  I mean, it's absolute eugenicism.
[00:44:15.106 --> 00:44:20.210]  It is, but they must know that it's completely fraudulent.
[00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.913]  They must know the real science, which I just talked about.
[00:44:22.953 --> 00:44:29.659]  So it even goes beyond racist, eugenicist beliefs about culling the herd to the point where
[00:44:30.279 --> 00:44:41.845]  The elite act as if they totally have hate and contempt for humanity, like they're some kind of invading alien species that's being brought here to wipe us all out.
[00:44:42.886 --> 00:44:48.669]  It's difficult to put it into logic, because they must know that it's complete nonsense, and yet they still push it.
[00:44:49.049 --> 00:44:52.471]  They indoctrinate the children with this belief, this eugenicist belief.
[00:44:53.411 --> 00:44:54.112]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:54.152 --> 00:44:56.254]  Now, you've got another article you want to talk about.
[00:44:56.274 --> 00:45:03.162]  You told me that utility bills in Europe, of course, are skyrocketing because of carbon taxes and other regulations.
[00:45:03.202 --> 00:45:09.629]  It's another part of just the entire oppressive infrastructure of changing not only
[00:45:10.269 --> 00:45:13.110]  The number of people that we've got, but the quality of everyone's life.
[00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:19.052]  And really, if you look at it, it's not just a quality of life issue, but it is also an issue of how long you're going to live.
[00:45:19.092 --> 00:45:24.794]  If you look at cheap available energy, that's a very good predictor of lifespan for a community.
[00:45:26.243 --> 00:45:35.366]  Well yeah, CO2 emissions are directly linked to prosperity, to quality of life, which is what this post-industrial revolution is all about.
[00:45:35.906 --> 00:45:41.008]  Recently in Britain, and in Europe in general, people are paying 17% more for their energy bills.
[00:45:41.468 --> 00:45:46.530]  There was this big controversy about the energy companies raising their electricity and gas prices.
[00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:53.173]  And the explanation given for that was that it was these greedy energy companies hoarding all the profit.
[00:45:53.393 --> 00:45:55.234]  It was this socialistic explanation.
[00:45:55.735 --> 00:46:02.098]  But what the news media, especially the BBC, didn't explain is the fact that these energy companies are
[00:46:02.658 --> 00:46:03.239]  No, I don't.
[00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.971]  ...than the actual monetary value of the energy they generate.
[00:46:26.431 --> 00:46:29.513]  So these energy companies have to pay money to build wind farms.
[00:46:30.273 --> 00:46:37.756]  Meanwhile, as in America with the EPA, they're being forced to mothball coal plants which provide cheap energy.
[00:46:38.377 --> 00:46:43.639]  And these costs for renewable energy are being passed on directly to the consumer.
[00:46:44.039 --> 00:46:46.844]  So it's already a carbon tax by stealth.
[00:46:47.265 --> 00:46:50.270]  So it's not the greedy energy companies that are doing this.
[00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:55.999]  They're being mandated by law to enforce European Union CO2 emission targets.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.542]  So again it goes back to this...
[00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:01.003]  This idea of collecting power in the hands of the state.
[00:47:01.563 --> 00:47:09.945]  Socialists will complain and whine all day about high energy bills, and they'll blame the greedy companies for it, but it's not their fault.
[00:47:10.045 --> 00:47:17.627]  They're only enforcing what they're mandated to do by the government, which is what's causing these energy prices to rise.
[00:47:17.987 --> 00:47:24.188]  Yeah, you know, renewable energy is a very trendy thing, and it's a great idea when you do it individually, when you do it off the grid.
[00:47:24.228 --> 00:47:38.071]  If you want to get solar power, if you want to get wind power, and you can pay... the most expensive part of those systems is trying to store the energy so that you have something, if you're off the grid, you have something when the wind is not blowing or when the sun is not shining.
[00:47:38.691 --> 00:47:41.772]  It really doesn't work for a major
[00:47:42.512 --> 00:47:42.932]  We're good.
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:10.185]  And they thought that if they extended it over a larger area that they would smooth out the peaks and the troughs, but instead all they got were larger peaks and larger troughs.
[00:48:10.525 --> 00:48:11.986]  And there's no way to smooth that out.
[00:48:12.026 --> 00:48:16.910]  You can't have electricity that is pulsating up and down over the grid.
[00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:18.451]  It has to be very stabilized.
[00:48:18.471 --> 00:48:29.498]  So what they wind up doing is cycling these existing coal plants as if they were some kind of an AC power source, and it increases the carbon output of the
[00:48:35.402 --> 00:48:39.385]  Well, precisely.
[00:48:39.585 --> 00:48:41.386]  I mean, look at what's happening in Spain.
[00:48:41.406 --> 00:48:44.328]  You've got people who've got solar panels, which is all fine and well.
[00:48:44.828 --> 00:48:49.551]  And now the government is taxing them for generating energy with their own solar panels.
[00:48:49.771 --> 00:48:50.112]  Right.
[00:48:50.152 --> 00:48:52.873]  So, they won't let you have self-sufficiency.
[00:48:53.394 --> 00:48:54.875]  But the point about the energy bills is,
[00:48:55.515 --> 00:49:01.216]  You know, it's not hitting the corporations, the oil and energy companies.
[00:49:01.656 --> 00:49:09.898]  It's hitting 80-year-old pensioners in Europe, some of whom are literally going to freeze to death this winter because they can't afford to pay the bills.
[00:49:10.178 --> 00:49:11.718]  And it's these green taxes.
[00:49:12.178 --> 00:49:14.579]  It's carbon taxes by default.
[00:49:14.699 --> 00:49:17.700]  They didn't have to impose it on, you know, tax per mile.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.220]  In Europe, they're already doing it.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:25.043]  In America, you've got the shale boom, which is kind of offsetting it a lot, but it's going to come to America too.
[00:49:25.103 --> 00:49:27.624]  And again, it's about post-industrial revolution.
[00:49:27.924 --> 00:49:39.149]  It's about a green economy, which in Spain has caused a 26% unemployment rate, 56% youth unemployment rate, and Obama said that was the model for America.
[00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:41.230]  So you've got that to look forward to.
[00:49:41.769 --> 00:49:44.070]  Well, you know, you mentioned the tax per mile.
[00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.071]  Now they're starting to talk about that in the U.S.
[00:49:46.111 --> 00:49:46.431]  as well.
[00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:54.835]  So you get people who go out and they buy renewable energy sources like solar, and then they get taxed by the Spanish authorities for having solar panels.
[00:49:55.155 --> 00:50:00.537]  You have people who go out and buy fuel-efficient cars, and then they change the method of taxation.
[00:50:00.577 --> 00:50:04.099]  We have a gasoline tax, which is basically a use tax.
[00:50:04.379 --> 00:50:05.960]  It's an anonymous use tax.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.981]  They don't have to know where you're going or how much you're driving.
[00:50:09.541 --> 00:50:10.503]  They don't have to track that.
[00:50:10.663 --> 00:50:13.607]  But it also reflects your use of the road.
[00:50:13.988 --> 00:50:19.976]  And you can do something to, if you're concerned about exhaust emissions for whatever reason, you can get a more fuel-efficient car.
[00:50:19.996 --> 00:50:23.221]  But now they're going to penalize the people who have invested in fuel-efficient cars.
[00:50:24.465 --> 00:50:31.091]  Well that's similar to what's happening in France, which is this eco-tax on vehicles weighing over 3.5 tonnes.
[00:50:31.412 --> 00:50:36.296]  So any vehicle that they're using to transport goods is now being hit with this eco-tax.
[00:50:36.337 --> 00:50:43.203]  They had to temporarily roll it back because this past weekend there were huge riots in Brittany and other areas of France.
[00:50:44.124 --> 00:50:48.869]  But they're now, again, taxing, as you said, for use of vehicles, not merely taxed by mile.
[00:50:49.389 --> 00:50:54.314]  That's affecting farmers in those areas as well, because they're the ones who are really getting hit with it.
[00:50:54.334 --> 00:51:00.980]  And of course it's going to come out in people's food costs, and people are going to say, oh, the greedy farmers, just like they talk about the greedy coal companies.
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.102]  Hang on, Paul, we're going to be right back, right after the break.
[00:51:10.563 --> 00:51:12.144]  Time and time again.
[00:51:12.164 --> 00:51:15.006]  You need to come here and help us.
[00:51:15.106 --> 00:51:16.187]  We need assistance.
[00:51:16.567 --> 00:51:17.087]  Please!
[00:51:17.367 --> 00:51:20.670]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:27.114]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:51:27.354 --> 00:51:29.695]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:51:29.876 --> 00:51:33.458]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.
[00:51:33.738 --> 00:51:36.941]  We are hurting down here and we need help!
[00:51:56.136 --> 00:51:56.977]  Immediately!
[00:51:57.037 --> 00:52:01.401]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.

[00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:24.751]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:24.791 --> 00:54:28.215]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex, and I'm talking to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:28.836 --> 00:54:33.941]  And we've been talking about renewable energy and what it's doing to fuel prices in England.
[00:54:34.722 --> 00:54:39.046]  Now, I said we would take your calls, and we've got a very special caller who always goes to the front of the line.
[00:54:39.086 --> 00:54:43.110]  That's Alex Jones, and he wanted to get in on this renewable energy discussion that we're having.
[00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:43.631]  Alex, are you there?
[00:54:45.623 --> 00:54:47.424]  I just want to make it clear.
[00:54:47.444 --> 00:54:48.645]  The Globalists are all on record.
[00:54:48.665 --> 00:54:51.387]  I made the film endgame about this with their own statements.
[00:55:08.775 --> 00:55:16.063]  They are creating a post-industrial world on purpose because the mega elite corporations are all exempt from these regulations.
[00:55:16.503 --> 00:55:20.847]  GE is exempt from the coal regulation that all the other companies aren't.
[00:55:21.268 --> 00:55:23.610]  All the big companies are exempt from the Obamacare.
[00:55:24.191 --> 00:55:31.839]  That is the heart of all this, because right through all their fake arguments, they are conscious criminals consolidating the economy,
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:41.243]  But creating socialism and communism at the grassroots, they're off to recoup under fascism, with diplomatic immunity, to make you dependent.
[00:55:41.263 --> 00:55:50.586]  So they will always raise the taxes, and they will always raise the price of energy, the ultimate tax, it's a form of siege, to where it's impossible to pay.
[00:55:51.186 --> 00:55:53.306]  And that is how they social engineer.
[00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:54.987]  It is totally diabolical.
[00:55:55.007 --> 00:55:57.228]  Look at Venezuela going bankrupt with their healthcare.
[00:55:57.548 --> 00:55:59.488]  Look at EU healthcare going bankrupt.
[00:55:59.868 --> 00:56:01.609]  But the elites all have their private clinics.
[00:56:02.242 --> 00:56:03.722]  So this is the plan.
[00:56:03.742 --> 00:56:07.523]  People have to understand it's not socialist mismanagement.
[00:56:07.543 --> 00:56:09.404]  People wonder why it's so screwed up.
[00:56:10.504 --> 00:56:19.406]  It couldn't be worse because it's precision military economic warfare on record and that's what they're doing.
[00:56:19.446 --> 00:56:21.066]  That's why I'm not against gay people.
[00:56:21.146 --> 00:56:22.347]  I don't even think about that.
[00:56:22.647 --> 00:56:25.227]  They say, oh you don't want to accept me teaching your five-year-olds about it.
[00:56:25.468 --> 00:56:31.449]  It's in all the government documents that we cover in Endgame 1.5 that they said we're going to teach this
[00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:37.232]  And go after heterosexuals in the family and tax the family where you cannot reproduce.
[00:56:37.492 --> 00:56:38.692]  We're going to add sterilists.
[00:56:38.752 --> 00:56:41.113]  And that's why they have the gay leaders everywhere.
[00:56:41.713 --> 00:56:48.355]  Literally, literally, I was invited ten years ago to a birthday party of a cousin who's gay.
[00:56:49.055 --> 00:56:51.476]  And the people all walked up to me bigotedly.
[00:56:51.576 --> 00:56:54.637]  I mean, I'm talking at a bar with like a hundred gay people, okay?
[00:56:55.477 --> 00:57:01.979]  And henpecked all the straight people there and told me it was gross that I had a son and that my wife was pregnant again.
[00:57:02.534 --> 00:57:05.315]  Because she was there and pregnant, and they literally ran us out of there.
[00:57:05.675 --> 00:57:06.455]  They were bigoted!
[00:57:06.655 --> 00:57:08.535]  I'm not bigoted, and I'm sick of it!
[00:57:08.755 --> 00:57:16.937]  This used a type of biological suicide bombing operation to cut everything off and to teach our kids, you know, that you don't need to have kids and it's bad.
[00:57:16.997 --> 00:57:22.338]  At Whole Foods, people marched up to my wife probably 15 times and said, you shouldn't have three kids.
[00:57:22.598 --> 00:57:24.219]  They can go to hell!
[00:57:24.679 --> 00:57:25.659]  I'll have more of my kids!
[00:57:26.218 --> 00:57:27.499]  Anyway, God bless you gentlemen.
[00:57:27.859 --> 00:57:28.860]  That's what I call them about.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:29.821]  They are the racist.
[00:57:29.841 --> 00:57:30.542]  They are the biggest.
[00:57:30.662 --> 00:57:32.563]  I'm not talking about the average gay person out there.
[00:57:33.604 --> 00:57:38.148]  I'm talking about the establishment using it as a weapon against humanity.
[00:57:40.322 --> 00:57:42.564]  And it's not just that they're exempt from the taxes, Alex.
[00:57:42.624 --> 00:57:45.205]  It's that, look who they want us to pay for indulgences.
[00:57:45.245 --> 00:57:48.428]  They want us to give money to Blood and Gore.
[00:57:48.628 --> 00:57:50.189]  To Al Gore and his partner, Blood.
[00:57:50.689 --> 00:57:54.672]  They want us to pay them, like a religious indulgence, to use energy.
[00:57:54.732 --> 00:57:56.593]  They want to make everybody renters.
[00:57:56.673 --> 00:57:58.835]  They don't want anybody to have anything.
[00:57:58.875 --> 00:57:59.855]  Just like the Federal Reserve.
[00:57:59.895 --> 00:58:03.018]  Just like we have to pay them every time a dollar is created.
[00:58:03.498 --> 00:58:07.200]  Every time you use a watt of energy, you have to pay Blood and Gore.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:09.182]  What do you think about that, Paul?
[00:58:10.868 --> 00:58:12.349]  Well, I mean, that's it.
[00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:14.970]  Going back to Ted Turner, he's got five kids.
[00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:19.833]  I mean, he supports the one-child policy for the world, and he's got five children.
[00:58:20.253 --> 00:58:22.154]  Same with Al Gore, I think he's got four kids.
[00:58:22.435 --> 00:58:23.175]  Well, he's exempt!
[00:58:23.995 --> 00:58:26.237]  Yeah, they're all exempt from it, don't worry about that.
[00:58:26.477 --> 00:58:27.197]  That's right, yeah.
[00:58:27.357 --> 00:58:29.298]  It's cultural Marxism, isn't it?
[00:58:29.338 --> 00:58:32.800]  This whole idea of attacking the family in Western civilization.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:33.521]  It's about
[00:58:34.321 --> 00:58:39.664]  Creating the myth that oppression comes from traditional western institutions and that is naturally oppressive.
[00:58:40.004 --> 00:58:41.624]  It's blatant cultural Marxism.
[00:58:41.865 --> 00:58:43.545]  It goes all the way back to Plato's Republic.
[00:58:43.605 --> 00:58:47.607]  He wanted to destroy the family because he wanted to make the government strong.
[00:58:51.729 --> 00:58:55.671]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:59.557 --> 00:59:04.658]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:59:05.018 --> 00:59:13.501]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:59:13.921 --> 00:59:21.223]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:59:21.743 --> 00:59:29.125]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:59:29.645 --> 00:59:33.046]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:59:33.586 --> 00:59:37.227]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:59:37.787 --> 00:59:44.369]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:51.652]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today, with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[00:59:52.132 --> 00:59:56.173]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.884]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.365 --> 01:00:07.130]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.769 --> 01:00:14.410]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:16.111]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:16.852 --> 01:00:17.953]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:19.415]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.196 --> 01:00:21.076]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:21.737 --> 01:00:25.341]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.941 --> 01:00:30.005]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.888 --> 01:00:37.229]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:40.771]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex, and I've got Paul Joseph Watson on the line with me.
[01:00:41.591 --> 01:00:53.699]  We just had a discussion with Alex, also talking about the eugenics, the forced abortions, population control that are being called for, the skyrocketing energy prices, attacks on the family.
[01:00:53.919 --> 01:00:55.280]  These are all related, aren't they, Paul?
[01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:57.702]  They're all tied together.
[01:00:57.762 --> 01:00:59.644]  It's part of the post-industrial revolution.
[01:00:59.684 --> 01:01:01.606]  It's the attack on Western civilization.
[01:01:02.046 --> 01:01:08.613]  The attack on biblical Christian beliefs, which for better or worse have provided stability in the West.
[01:01:08.693 --> 01:01:10.215]  And now they're trying to overthrow that.
[01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:14.179]  And as I said before the break, it's cultural Marxism to the nth degree.
[01:01:14.199 --> 01:01:14.819]  That's right.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.523]  And we're talking about, briefly, I mentioned Plato's Republic.
[01:01:18.603 --> 01:01:19.925]  He wanted to make sure that
[01:01:20.465 --> 01:01:28.108]  In his ideal republic, where you were going to have this benevolent dictator, presumably, he wanted to make sure that there was no family structure.
[01:01:28.628 --> 01:01:33.830]  So he promoted sexual promiscuity, so that nobody would know who their mother and father were.
[01:01:34.271 --> 01:01:37.952]  And the children would be raised by the state, and the children would be loyal to the state.
[01:01:38.052 --> 01:01:39.993]  Not to a family, not to a mother and father.
[01:01:40.453 --> 01:01:45.115]  And that's the same type of program that we see actually put into the government schools.
[01:01:45.175 --> 01:01:51.698]  That was in the writing of Thomas Dewey and Horace Mann, many of the founders of government education in America.
[01:01:51.758 --> 01:01:54.880]  They were not happy with the way families were raising their children.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.461]  They didn't want them to have these religious values or whatever.
[01:01:57.501 --> 01:02:03.864]  They wanted to move them into a socialist control where the government told them what to think, what to do, shaped everything for them.
[01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:09.821]  The old adage, give me a child by the time they're, you know, up to the age of three, they're mine for life, that type of thing.
[01:02:11.593 --> 01:02:18.657]  It's similar, isn't it, to both the Communist Manifesto and that document which they called the 45 Declared Goals of Communism.
[01:02:19.077 --> 01:02:37.246]  That was all about weakening the family and also a lot of the cultural aspects that they introduced from the 60s onwards were about that, including specifically modern art, which it later turned out was funded from the 50s, Jackson Pollock and all that crowd, by the CIA itself to make art non-political.
[01:02:37.566 --> 01:02:47.400]  So through a variety of different cultural ways they tried to weaken the fundamental base of Western civilization and they're aggressively doing it to this day.
[01:02:48.874 --> 01:02:49.294]  That's right.
[01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:51.535]  Let's move on to another article that you've got up.
[01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:55.476]  DHS publicly denies preparation for riots and civil unrest.
[01:02:55.496 --> 01:03:04.419]  Now, you've been at the forefront of showing us what the DHS is really preparing for, what Homeland Security is doing, buying massive amounts of ammunition.
[01:03:04.919 --> 01:03:07.940]  You went to the fedbiz.op site.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.141]  You showed the actual documents where they're ordering this stuff, and there was a lot of pushback on it.
[01:03:12.161 --> 01:03:15.522]  It took a very long time, but finally everybody started to realize this is real.
[01:03:17.398 --> 01:03:26.023]  Exactly, and then the DHS came out a couple of days ago to the International Business Times and said, basically, these reports are false, they're not preparing for riots.
[01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:32.247]  Their direct quote was, this routine acquisition planning is not in response to or anticipation of any potential situation.
[01:03:32.728 --> 01:03:37.651]  But, in their own solicitation documents, they said precisely the opposite.
[01:03:38.611 --> 01:03:42.512]  Well, these preparations are not routine in any way, shape or form.
[01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:49.013]  I mean, just the ammunition that they're buying is enough, as people pointed out, to fight the Iraq War at its peak for 20 years.
[01:03:50.213 --> 01:04:00.615]  And the armed guards, $80 million dollars on armed guards in New York, they said, I didn't say it, InfoWars didn't say it, the DHS said it was for, quote, public demonstrations and civil disturbances.
[01:04:01.335 --> 01:04:03.335]  Those were their words, not mine.
[01:04:03.736 --> 01:04:06.216]  Then with the pepper spray projectiles, they said,
[01:04:06.656 --> 01:04:08.357]  These are just for training purposes.
[01:04:08.797 --> 01:04:12.618]  They bought 117,000 training projectiles.
[01:04:12.658 --> 01:04:16.959]  They also purchased 120,000 live projectiles.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.400]  So they're not just for training purposes.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:27.783]  And again, when they bought Riot Gear back in June, the DHS itself admitted that they were for, quote, riot control situations.
[01:04:28.103 --> 01:04:30.684]  So they're admitting it's for riot control, then publicly
[01:04:31.044 --> 01:04:35.347]  Months later, they come out and say, oh, it's just routine, it's no specific situation.
[01:04:35.867 --> 01:04:37.008]  Again, they're lying.
[01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:39.910]  It says in their own documents that they are for riot control.
[01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:42.591]  Yeah, they were telling us that's what hollow point bullets were for.
[01:04:42.611 --> 01:04:46.353]  And then we go in and cherry pick the very smallest purchases and say there's nothing to worry about.
[01:04:46.774 --> 01:04:48.115]  Paul, it was great talking to you.
[01:04:48.895 --> 01:04:49.796]  Good to be on, David.
[01:04:50.016 --> 01:04:50.256]  Thanks.
[01:04:50.316 --> 01:04:53.538]  And we're going to be right back with Anthony Gucciardi right after the break.
[01:04:53.558 --> 01:04:56.480]  And we've got some other interesting things to talk about with eugenics.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.500]  So stay tuned.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.281]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.445]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:05:13.605 --> 01:05:16.568]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:05:16.729 --> 01:05:21.954]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:05:22.295 --> 01:05:23.956]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:05:24.237 --> 01:05:25.478]  We are what we eat.
[01:05:25.838 --> 01:05:30.184]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:05:30.525 --> 01:05:34.510]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.074]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:05:37.294 --> 01:05:43.222]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:06:09.318 --> 01:06:15.563]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:06:15.963 --> 01:06:18.345]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:06:18.425 --> 01:06:18.725]  The U.S.
[01:06:18.785 --> 01:06:22.928]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:06:23.028 --> 01:06:25.610]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:27.231]  They want that attack to come.
[01:06:27.471 --> 01:06:33.656]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:36.498]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:06:36.718 --> 01:06:41.501]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:06:41.681 --> 01:06:49.126]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:06:49.426 --> 01:06:51.988]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:54.831]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[01:07:14.228 --> 01:07:21.475]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:07:21.615 --> 01:07:24.798]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:26.759]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:07:27.019 --> 01:07:31.581]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:07:31.661 --> 01:07:34.422]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:07:34.563 --> 01:07:40.345]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:07:40.525 --> 01:07:44.007]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:07:44.207 --> 01:07:49.269]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[01:08:15.158 --> 01:08:16.159]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.041]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:18.681 --> 01:08:19.482]  You want answers?
[01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:21.163]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:21.804 --> 01:08:25.447]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.007 --> 01:08:30.070]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.499 --> 01:08:34.819]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:34.879 --> 01:08:36.320]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:45.263]  We were just talking to Paul Joseph Watson about calls for Malthusian population control and the applause that celebrities get when they call for that.
[01:08:46.183 --> 01:08:51.345]  And before that, I talked about a doctor that we've got here in Houston that is... They're trying to get an investigation.
[01:08:51.365 --> 01:08:52.345]  He's not being investigated.
[01:08:52.385 --> 01:08:55.186]  I wish I could say that he was, but there's no evidence that...
[01:08:55.766 --> 01:09:08.174]  The Houston authorities are actually conducting an investigation, but he's been accused by workers in his clinic of killing babies that were born alive, twisting the heads off of newborn babies.
[01:09:09.014 --> 01:09:13.017]  And so far as we can tell, there's no investigation going in Houston about that.
[01:09:13.797 --> 01:09:15.378]  But that's kind of the topic that we've been on.
[01:09:15.398 --> 01:09:25.006]  We've been talking about that, population control, and now we've got Anthony Gucciardi from StoryLeak joining us here, and he's got an interesting take on this whole eugenicist thing from Reddick.
[01:09:25.466 --> 01:09:26.127]  Tell us about that.
[01:09:26.427 --> 01:09:27.028]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:27.068 --> 01:09:33.753]  So just going into this, even some of the most hardened listeners right now, they might know eugenics by definition means selective breeding.
[01:09:34.093 --> 01:09:43.738]  But throughout history, its implementation has always been to take certain races, certain individuals they deemed unfit to breed, and sterilize them or kill them off.
[01:09:44.418 --> 01:09:48.460]  And that even happened in the United States from about 1929 to 1974.
[01:09:49.741 --> 01:09:53.362]  Admittedly, in the open, they would go in and break down your door and forcibly sterilize you.
[01:09:53.382 --> 01:09:55.103]  I mean, that's from the Associated Press.
[01:09:55.123 --> 01:10:00.006]  We're talking about 60,000 people that were forcibly sterilized, mainly black women.
[01:10:00.826 --> 01:10:03.407]  And it is actually inherently real racism.
[01:10:03.808 --> 01:10:05.909]  It's not phony racism like the media uses.
[01:10:05.949 --> 01:10:07.429]  It's not like this voter ID thing.
[01:10:07.489 --> 01:10:14.013]  I mean, you're not asking for somebody, you're not saying that we want to see your photo ID before so we can verify your identity vote.
[01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:18.415]  You're actually saying we're going to stop you from reproducing because of who you are.
[01:10:18.575 --> 01:10:24.638]  No, this is kick down your door and inject you and sterilize you and you are unfit to breathe.
[01:10:24.698 --> 01:10:29.661]  You are not a human being with any rights going directly against the Constitution.
[01:10:29.941 --> 01:10:47.671]  But the reason I get into this specifically is, yes, we did have that history where 60,000 in the United States just after World War II were sterilized, in many cases with North Carolina specifically, where they awarded the families a mere $50,000 and said, we're sorry that we sterilized individuals in your
[01:10:48.591 --> 01:10:49.151]  Wow.
[01:10:49.331 --> 01:10:52.912]  That was their severance package.
[01:10:53.392 --> 01:11:03.795]  I guess they figured that was a benefit because one of the tactics that abortionists will use is to tell a woman who's considering an abortion, look at how much this child is going to cost you of your life.
[01:11:03.855 --> 01:11:04.595]  You can't afford this.
[01:11:04.615 --> 01:11:10.476]  So I guess if they look at this and say, well, you know, we saved you all this money that you're going to have to feed this child and put them through college.
[01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:11.677]  So we saved you all that money.
[01:11:11.697 --> 01:11:12.637]  So here's your $50,000 extra.
[01:11:12.697 --> 01:11:14.197]  It is trendy now not to have children.
[01:11:14.217 --> 01:11:16.858]  It's trendy now to say abortions are good up to age five.
[01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:27.850]  But we're specifically going to get into this amazing revelation here that surprisingly, apparently, a large percentage of people actually support eugenics in modern day.
[01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:30.994]  We're talking about forced sterilization of 13-year-olds.
[01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:34.598]  We're talking about saying that Hitler ruined eugenics for the rest of us.
[01:11:35.118 --> 01:11:38.821]  We're talking about saying eugenics is good because it makes people more handsome.
[01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:40.142]  We shouldn't let certain people breed.
[01:11:40.182 --> 01:11:44.665]  We shouldn't let individuals who are susceptible to committing crimes breed.
[01:11:44.765 --> 01:11:45.626]  And this is on Reddit.
[01:11:45.646 --> 01:11:46.747]  And I'm not against Reddit.
[01:11:46.767 --> 01:11:50.770]  I think it's actually a good hub for, you know, internet freedom.
[01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:52.311]  It's a good hub for alternative news.
[01:11:52.591 --> 01:11:54.873]  But it's a collective group of individuals.
[01:11:54.933 --> 01:11:57.355]  Reddit is essentially a social community for those who are not aware.
[01:11:57.395 --> 01:12:00.417]  It's essentially an adaptation, let's say, of Facebook.
[01:12:00.457 --> 01:12:02.879]  It's a message board where you post articles and you can comment on them.
[01:12:03.579 --> 01:12:13.209]  And it's just, you know, a medley of individuals, but we've found that when you're using an anonymous username, individuals will actually come out and support Hitler and will support you.
[01:12:13.249 --> 01:12:14.150]  That's a good point.
[01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.312]  Programming is so strong on that.
[01:12:16.372 --> 01:12:20.636]  But first, before we can get into that in this segment, I wanted to talk specifically about
[01:12:21.477 --> 01:12:24.619]  Historically leading up to this, how it's already been going on.
[01:12:25.259 --> 01:12:35.385]  For example, we see the US government program that secretly injected citizens with plutonium just to see how it would affect them and how it would affect different races of people.
[01:12:35.946 --> 01:12:39.187]  So, specifically, I don't know if you're even aware of this, David,
[01:12:40.428 --> 01:12:44.370]  They called it one of the most appalling acts by the United States government, even the mainstream media.
[01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:52.592]  They went around in 1945 and secretly injected a 53-year-old man with 4.7 micrograms of plutonium.
[01:12:53.293 --> 01:12:55.333]  And just to see what happened, they did it with a bunch of others.
[01:12:55.373 --> 01:12:57.574]  This is specifically one individual.
[01:12:58.074 --> 01:12:59.655]  His name was Ebb Cade.
[01:13:00.235 --> 01:13:07.078]  And what happened was, he was blasted with extreme amounts of plutonium, and they cut out a piece of his bone without, you know, any
[01:13:08.238 --> 01:13:28.404]  Any drugs or anything for sampling they pulled 15 of his teeth in order to test the effects of plutonium And the torture was so bad that he escaped the hospital in the middle of the night and ran away And from the prolonged torture where they just cutting him open just ripping things out of his body to Tesla Yeah, see the plutonium effects and say hey, how did it affect this man?
[01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:30.664]  You know how to defect this woman over and over again.
[01:13:30.724 --> 01:13:32.405]  He escaped and then he eventually died and
[01:13:33.498 --> 01:13:34.619]  That is what's going on.
[01:13:34.659 --> 01:13:35.921]  And that was funded by the government.
[01:13:35.961 --> 01:13:37.943]  They told the doctors, hey, just don't tell anyone about it.
[01:13:37.983 --> 01:13:40.006]  We'll give you a major severance package.
[01:13:40.046 --> 01:13:41.047]  Just do this to everyone.
[01:13:41.347 --> 01:13:47.715]  And they would have people coming in with broken arms saying, hey, you know, my arm is broken or a pregnant woman saying, hey, you know, I'm not feeling too good.
[01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:49.498]  Oh, yeah, we've got something for that.
[01:13:49.778 --> 01:13:52.121]  And they inject you with plutonium just to see what would happen.
[01:13:52.301 --> 01:14:05.441]  Well, you know, Anthony, it was about a year ago that the story broke that in North Carolina, right, where I had moved from, the EPA was grabbing people for, they were trying to make a case for stronger regulations of particulate matter.
[01:14:06.249 --> 01:14:19.896]  And they were putting out ads for people, specifically looking for people who had asthma or other breathing irregularities, and they were hooking them up to machines that were feeding them diesel fumes directly, and experimenting on them.
[01:14:20.617 --> 01:14:26.940]  And a lawsuit was filed, and the government said, we're the government, we don't have to really follow those rules.
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.701]  They, you know, they got away with it.
[01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:30.642]  They didn't, you know, they didn't stop it.
[01:14:30.822 --> 01:14:31.803]  They continued doing it.
[01:14:32.503 --> 01:14:35.525]  And so that's still going on to this very day.
[01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:42.027]  No, it always happens and then, like decades later, a figure in the United States will apologize for it.
[01:14:42.067 --> 01:14:45.888]  Like Obama will say, sorry we secretly injected you with STDs just to see what would happen.
[01:14:46.208 --> 01:14:49.368]  And the reason we're talking about this is all of this ties into eugenics.
[01:14:50.009 --> 01:14:51.029]  And let's give it a new term.
[01:14:51.209 --> 01:14:53.349]  Neo-eugenics is the new idea here.
[01:14:53.449 --> 01:14:57.590]  That is old-school, Hitlerian-style eugenics where it's out in the open.
[01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:59.651]  Going in and forcibly sterilizing people.
[01:15:00.091 --> 01:15:10.454]  We're gonna get into what these people are saying in the comments with 3,000 upvotes about Hitler just ruined eugenics for the rest of us, how eugenics isn't even bad, it's just been given a bad name.
[01:15:10.674 --> 01:15:11.834]  And hey, Tesla supported it.
[01:15:11.954 --> 01:15:13.074]  Tesla did actually support it.
[01:15:13.374 --> 01:15:14.294]  But let's get into this.
[01:15:14.334 --> 01:15:20.556]  So the posts that we're speaking of right now, and I only have the pronouns, I will have a report about this on StoryLeak and Infowars.com.
[01:15:21.336 --> 01:15:34.169]  It's talking about today I learned that Nikola Tesla was in favor of sterilizing criminals and mentally unstable and believed that by 2100 the year 2100 no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny.
[01:15:35.103 --> 01:15:45.128]  Now, there's a bunch of different comments here with major upvotes, specifically 2,000, 3,000, you know, top comments, top upvotes, and this is a website that gets millions of users a day.
[01:15:45.688 --> 01:15:49.710]  And again, I'm not against the site overall, it's just this thread of comments is amazing to me.
[01:15:50.271 --> 01:15:59.095]  This guy says, he's the number, I believe he's the number three comment on there, majorly upvoted, he says, Hitler ruined eugenics for the rest of us.
[01:15:59.775 --> 01:16:02.497]  He has 2,325 upvotes.
[01:16:02.997 --> 01:16:04.938]  That means 2,325 people agree with it.
[01:16:05.279 --> 01:16:06.479]  And that's not even counting the downvotes.
[01:16:06.539 --> 01:16:10.162]  The amazing thing is that because Tesla was for it.
[01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:12.795]  Or because Hitler was for it.
[01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:17.479]  I mean, you look at this and you evaluate it on its own moral grounds.
[01:16:17.499 --> 01:16:19.862]  You know, it doesn't... Tesla did electricity.
[01:16:19.982 --> 01:16:21.863]  He wasn't a moral ethicist.
[01:16:22.404 --> 01:16:24.726]  And so just because he supported this doesn't make it right.
[01:16:24.786 --> 01:16:26.167]  But that's the way people think.
[01:16:26.487 --> 01:16:31.312]  They look at people that they like or people that they don't like and that's... What's their comment there?
[01:16:31.332 --> 01:16:32.673]  It's like, you know... No, it's all intense programming.
[01:16:32.693 --> 01:16:33.353]  You're 100% right.
[01:16:33.373 --> 01:16:37.417]  Look at the drama series where they admit that they were given money to support Obamacare and stuff like that.
[01:16:37.737 --> 01:16:39.939]  Anything people see on TV, they try to be that.
[01:16:40.419 --> 01:16:43.902]  Because that is their only embodiment of social interaction sometimes.
[01:16:44.222 --> 01:16:45.243]  And they sell personalities.
[01:16:45.263 --> 01:16:46.524]  That's the way Obama got in.
[01:16:46.704 --> 01:16:47.885]  Because most people liked him.
[01:16:48.165 --> 01:16:49.686]  He had no history.
[01:16:50.246 --> 01:16:52.468]  Nobody knew where he was coming from.
[01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:54.689]  Well, he did have some history in Chicago.
[01:16:54.749 --> 01:16:59.113]  I mean, he knew that he was the most supportive of abortions of anybody that had ever...
[01:17:00.174 --> 01:17:03.176]  In an office, he supported late-term abortions very strongly.
[01:17:03.256 --> 01:17:04.397]  We knew a few other things about him.
[01:17:04.778 --> 01:17:06.339]  For the most part, he was a blank slate.
[01:17:06.359 --> 01:17:14.227]  And even the people who voted for him said they were very disappointed that they thought he was going to be like X. He turned out to be like Y. But they were voting for a personality.
[01:17:14.907 --> 01:17:16.329]  And that's what people are doing here.
[01:17:16.369 --> 01:17:19.833]  They're, like you said, they're attaching themselves to personality.
[01:17:20.174 --> 01:17:22.196]  You know, Hitler was bad and he gave a stigma to this.
[01:17:22.817 --> 01:17:23.458]  Tesla was good.
[01:17:23.478 --> 01:17:27.282]  So let's talk about Tesla liking eugenics so we can make eugenics popular now.
[01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:31.908]  Well, that's why Bill Gates says, you know, we need to vaccinate more people so that we can reduce the population.
[01:17:32.288 --> 01:17:36.853]  People like that are propped up on a pedestal and act like they're genius and we need to listen to them.
[01:17:36.893 --> 01:17:47.325]  But at a deeper level, it's this weird, ironic, disturbing racism that is actually proliferating this entire progressive concept or this entire neo-eugenics concept.
[01:17:47.825 --> 01:17:49.466]  That yes, certain people are unfit to breathe.
[01:17:49.506 --> 01:17:51.287]  The elderly are a waste of space.
[01:17:51.307 --> 01:17:52.768]  You know, we actually should have death panels.
[01:17:53.088 --> 01:18:03.275]  But then at the same time, they'll say, you know, all white people are bad because George Zimmerman, who isn't even white, you know, defended himself against a black man.
[01:18:03.815 --> 01:18:14.990]  And it's this weird, distorted, nefarious race baiting when we're looking at comments now from individuals that would no question identify as progressives or liberals or whatever and it doesn't even matter.
[01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:16.572]  It's all a phony system, I know that.
[01:18:16.993 --> 01:18:17.994]  But look at this comment.
[01:18:18.809 --> 01:18:22.551]  This guy, he has 194 upvotes and he is being supported.
[01:18:22.571 --> 01:18:30.536]  He says, honestly, if they could make it 100% reversible, all males should be sterilized before they turn 13.
[01:18:31.137 --> 01:18:32.117]  No more oopsies.
[01:18:32.218 --> 01:18:34.359]  It will have to be consensual to have children.
[01:18:34.699 --> 01:18:41.944]  And he goes on and says, hey, there are women who poke holes in condoms to impregnate others and stuff like that.
[01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.725]  We need to end this right now.
[01:18:44.065 --> 01:18:46.807]  And he goes on to say, he had a child on accident.
[01:18:47.427 --> 01:18:49.049]  And it was not on purpose and a mistake.
[01:18:49.389 --> 01:18:53.272]  And he said, you can be upset at me for saying this, but I told my son he was an accident.
[01:18:53.673 --> 01:18:57.356]  And I would like to prevent future people from having kids who aren't fit to breed.
[01:18:57.376 --> 01:19:02.040]  And then others go in and they say, well, hey, did you hear about this new male birth control procedure?
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.982]  It's 100% effective in the last 10 years.
[01:19:05.003 --> 01:19:10.187]  And the response is, just telling my roommates about this, possibly the best invention ever.
[01:19:10.448 --> 01:19:11.369]  Permanent sterilization.
[01:19:12.597 --> 01:19:14.158]  And then they say, well, hey, it's worth it.
[01:19:14.838 --> 01:19:21.002]  You know, a needle to the genitals is a lot less painful than letting go of your future plans because you had a child come into the picture.
[01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:21.663]  Wow.
[01:19:21.683 --> 01:19:23.063]  Children are now evil.
[01:19:23.424 --> 01:19:23.604]  Yeah.
[01:19:23.964 --> 01:19:28.006]  I mean, people actually think that everyone should be forcibly sterilized before they turn 13.
[01:19:28.106 --> 01:19:30.688]  I mean, maybe they're going to get that with Gardasil anyway, though.
[01:19:30.708 --> 01:19:36.852]  In California, you don't need parental permission to go in and inject girls and soon enough boys with Gardasil.
[01:19:37.552 --> 01:19:38.553]  That's really scary.
[01:19:38.613 --> 01:19:47.557]  And you know, people like this are the ones who are very easily brought into being, thinking that they're going to be part of the elite who are going to be fine.
[01:19:47.577 --> 01:19:53.060]  You know, if we're going to take out the entire population with some kind of mousepox, that's okay.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.681]  I'm going to be one of the guys that's going to survive.
[01:19:54.721 --> 01:19:56.242]  I'm going to cooperate with the system.
[01:19:56.722 --> 01:19:59.204]  That kind of rampant elitism
[01:20:00.064 --> 01:20:05.025]  Divorce from any morality, divorce from any sensitivity to anybody is really, really frightening.
[01:20:05.045 --> 01:20:07.746]  We're going to be back to talk a little bit more about this with Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:20:07.766 --> 01:20:08.366]  Stay tuned.
[01:20:09.106 --> 01:20:14.707]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:20:14.847 --> 01:20:22.088]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:20:22.228 --> 01:20:25.409]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:20:25.549 --> 01:20:27.350]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:32.151]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:20:32.231 --> 01:20:34.972]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:20:35.152 --> 01:20:40.934]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:20:41.094 --> 01:20:44.575]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.

[01:21:18.443 --> 01:21:20.144]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[01:21:20.524 --> 01:21:21.785]  Police call it robbery.
[01:21:22.706 --> 01:21:24.127]  We call it avoidable.

[01:21:36.076 --> 01:21:42.100]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[01:21:43.281 --> 01:21:49.988]  At only $29.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.

[01:24:27.122 --> 01:24:28.485]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:28.545 --> 01:24:37.444]  I'm David Knight, and I'm joined in studio here with Anthony Gucciardi of StoryLeak, and we were just talking about our... Did Hitler give eugenics a bad name?
[01:24:38.592 --> 01:24:42.495]  There's a lot of people out there now that are still talking about population control.
[01:24:42.575 --> 01:24:47.938]  As Anthony pointed out, we've got a long history in this country of experimentation on people.
[01:24:48.859 --> 01:24:55.804]  And we just had that a year ago with the EPA in North Carolina conducting experiments, having people directly breathe diesel gas.
[01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.365]  But it's far worse than that.
[01:24:57.405 --> 01:25:02.989]  As Anthony pointed out, we've got people who were injected with plutonium and other horrendous things.
[01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:04.990]  We've got a clip here from
[01:25:06.511 --> 01:25:08.953]  Bill Gates talking about death panels and healthcare.
[01:25:08.973 --> 01:25:11.754]  Let's take a look at what the elitists really think.
[01:25:12.294 --> 01:25:17.998]  And before we do that, let me give out our phone number.
[01:25:18.018 --> 01:25:18.338]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:18.858 --> 01:25:23.381]  If you agree with this elitism, with this eugenics, give us a call.
[01:25:23.421 --> 01:25:31.626]  If you want to make the case that you think that Hitler gave eugenics a bad name, you think that we really ought to control the population, you think we really ought to be selective about who's allowed to have children,
[01:25:32.046 --> 01:25:39.810]  If you think that the population is too great and we need to have forced population control, forced abortions, give us a call at 800-259-9231.
[01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:43.412]  We only want people who disagree with us on this.
[01:25:44.012 --> 01:25:46.654]  Let's take a look at what Bill Gates thinks about this.
[01:25:47.130 --> 01:26:01.751]  That's a trade-off society is making because of very, very high medical costs and a lack of willingness to say, you know, is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off?
[01:26:02.432 --> 01:26:06.936]  The, those ten teachers and to make that trade off in medical costs.
[01:26:06.976 --> 01:26:08.558]  But that's called the death panel.
[01:26:09.278 --> 01:26:11.120]  Uh, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:23.551]  So you, of course, that's an interesting thing you just said, which is just the last three months in life for one person or something, because we haven't had a discussion of how to allocate that money.
[01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:24.732]  There you go.
[01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:30.817]  I mean, if Bill Gates is for it, and Tesla is for it, I mean, how can we disagree with people of that stature?
[01:26:30.997 --> 01:26:32.218]  Notice how calm they are.
[01:26:32.298 --> 01:26:38.123]  Oh, that's an interesting idea that we should kill off people that we are deeming less worthy than ourselves.
[01:26:38.523 --> 01:26:39.704]  It's the whole notion here.
[01:26:40.104 --> 01:26:46.589]  And the reason we're highlighting this is that this isn't just a historical fact that 60,000 were forcibly sterilized.
[01:26:46.609 --> 01:26:49.811]  This isn't just a historical fact that the government admittedly
[01:26:50.692 --> 01:26:54.997]  Documents show, and they're now apologizing for it, injected people with STDs.
[01:26:55.117 --> 01:26:57.640]  Injected people with plutonium just to see what would happen.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.722]  That is actually real racism.
[01:26:59.782 --> 01:27:03.066]  That is actually real population control, Hitlerian style.
[01:27:03.606 --> 01:27:09.433]  And then we're looking at these comments here, and there's a few more off of Reddit, which again is just a community website.
[01:27:09.893 --> 01:27:11.034]  Reddit itself is not saying this.
[01:27:11.634 --> 01:27:12.674]  It's equivalent to Facebook.
[01:27:12.734 --> 01:27:15.095]  People on Facebook saying this, but there's thousands of them.
[01:27:15.175 --> 01:27:24.940]  There's millions of users on this website saying, upvoting these different comments that are saying, for example, it's not that the morals were different back then, it's that science was.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.582]  If sterilizing the mentally ill would actually work to prevent crime, I'd be all for it.
[01:27:30.402 --> 01:27:33.643]  Though it'd be something of a sacrifice, obviously, that's another comment.
[01:27:33.983 --> 01:27:39.344]  The problem is that it wouldn't work, so it'd be a cruel, seeming, and pointless sacrifice, so I do oppose it.
[01:27:39.364 --> 01:27:45.125]  And then he goes on to say, but you know, if it did work, if we could identify pre-crime, then we should sterilize them.
[01:27:45.325 --> 01:27:46.225]  Because they're criminals.
[01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:48.846]  So what does pre-crime mean, though?
[01:27:48.866 --> 01:27:51.406]  Well, maybe we could tell, you know, by the number of bumps on their head.
[01:27:51.426 --> 01:27:55.567]  You know, remember phrenology, where they would identify people as criminals by their facial features?
[01:27:56.087 --> 01:27:59.068]  That was essentially kind of feeding in, in a way, to this whole racism thing.
[01:27:59.389 --> 01:28:02.110]  You look a certain way, you act a certain way, you know, we can take that.
[01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:11.634]  One of the things about Bill Gates' comment there that strikes me is the fact that he's going to make these decisions for us, and that all comes along with the government controlling our health care.
[01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:15.176]  Again, you know, he's sitting there thinking, well, you know, what should our trade-offs be?
[01:28:15.236 --> 01:28:20.378]  Should we allow this older person to have health care, or should we buy, or should we pay 10 teachers?
[01:28:20.479 --> 01:28:20.879]  In other words,
[01:28:21.619 --> 01:28:24.061]  They're making these decisions for us.
[01:28:24.141 --> 01:28:30.065]  It's kind of a mixture of paternalism and elitism, but it's really got a eugenics base to it.
[01:28:30.185 --> 01:28:32.106]  Yeah, because they're not even just saying, should we give them health care?
[01:28:32.126 --> 01:28:33.707]  They're saying, we're just going to let them die.
[01:28:34.307 --> 01:28:37.069]  We're not going to perform the surgery that we should.
[01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:37.930]  We're going to kill them.
[01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:38.950]  Even if they don't have money.
[01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.651]  Even if they have money.
[01:28:40.251 --> 01:28:45.376]  But we're talking about, we're not just talking about, hey, this group says, you know, that maybe they shouldn't breed.
[01:28:45.396 --> 01:28:49.841]  We're talking about going into ghettos, they would, and just sterilize people and just knock their doors down.
[01:28:49.861 --> 01:28:51.943]  I mean, that is forcible action.
[01:28:52.443 --> 01:28:59.831]  And what's amazing to me, while we're highlighting it, is that there's new, this neo-eugenics is a term that we're making up right now to describe this.
[01:29:00.251 --> 01:29:01.492]  They're going in and saying,
[01:29:02.714 --> 01:29:04.795]  All across the board here, that it's actually a good idea.
[01:29:04.855 --> 01:29:07.037]  And then we ask, what does pre-crime even mean?
[01:29:07.798 --> 01:29:08.718]  How do you determine that?
[01:29:08.778 --> 01:29:16.204]  Well, someone, a conspiracy theorist, is now, according to the Bible of psychiatric medicine, a mental illness.
[01:29:16.485 --> 01:29:16.725]  Oh yeah.
[01:29:16.925 --> 01:29:18.026]  Criticizing the government.
[01:29:18.226 --> 01:29:22.229]  Because if you criticize the government, you may actually be a criminal.
[01:29:22.289 --> 01:29:25.892]  You may actually get upset and start shooting people or do something about it.
[01:29:26.132 --> 01:29:26.513]  Violent.
[01:29:26.573 --> 01:29:31.977]  Yeah, I mean, the TSA shooter, they say that anyone who's ever criticized the TSA is responsible for that.
[01:29:32.397 --> 01:29:32.718]  Anyone.
[01:29:32.858 --> 01:29:36.701]  So basically 99% of Americans are now evil and insane.
[01:29:36.741 --> 01:29:37.982]  So they should be sterilized.
[01:29:38.042 --> 01:29:38.943]  I mean, that's how that works.
[01:29:39.543 --> 01:29:40.444]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:29:41.044 --> 01:29:42.125]  We want to take your calls.
[01:29:42.466 --> 01:29:45.668]  That number is 800-259-9231.
[01:29:45.748 --> 01:29:47.290]  Give us a call if you disagree with us.
[01:29:47.410 --> 01:29:50.613]  If you think that there should be some control over the population.
[01:29:50.693 --> 01:29:53.895]  If you think that the people that you don't like should be taken out.
[01:29:54.216 --> 01:29:54.576]  Let us know.
[01:29:54.596 --> 01:29:55.857]  We want to hear if you disagree with us.
[01:29:56.397 --> 01:29:56.998]  Be right back.
[01:29:58.359 --> 01:29:59.300]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.362]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.282 --> 01:30:04.965]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.679 --> 01:30:14.781]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:30:15.141 --> 01:30:23.623]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:30:24.023 --> 01:30:31.326]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:30:31.866 --> 01:30:39.248]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:30:39.748 --> 01:30:43.149]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:47.351]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[01:30:47.891 --> 01:30:54.494]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.

[01:31:08.926 --> 01:31:12.007]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:31:12.387 --> 01:31:18.108]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:31:18.348 --> 01:31:24.729]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:31:24.929 --> 01:31:30.330]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:34.251]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:31:34.451 --> 01:31:38.014]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:31:38.254 --> 01:31:42.617]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:31:42.858 --> 01:31:45.179]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:31:45.359 --> 01:31:48.902]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:31:49.202 --> 01:31:53.486]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[01:31:53.626 --> 01:31:56.288]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:31:56.588 --> 01:32:03.015]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:32:03.416 --> 01:32:07.660]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:10.271]  I had tried everything.
[01:32:10.331 --> 01:32:12.472]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:32:12.692 --> 01:32:15.394]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:32:15.814 --> 01:32:20.296]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[01:32:20.657 --> 01:32:27.040]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:32:27.521 --> 01:32:37.947]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:32:38.707 --> 01:32:42.849]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:49.233]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:32:49.453 --> 01:32:50.594]  Now that's results.
[01:32:51.014 --> 01:32:57.437]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[01:32:57.817 --> 01:33:03.481]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:33:06.082 --> 01:33:07.343]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[01:33:12.472 --> 01:33:13.493]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.514 --> 01:33:14.535]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:15.156]  For your mind.
[01:33:35.094 --> 01:33:36.515]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:36.575 --> 01:33:40.897]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex, and I'm joined here in studio with Anthony Gucciardi from StoryLeague.
[01:33:40.937 --> 01:33:48.400]  And we were just talking about these Reddit comments people are making anonymously, talking about how they agree with eugenicism.
[01:33:49.261 --> 01:33:53.103]  And we've got the phones open for people who agree with that as well.
[01:33:53.123 --> 01:33:54.303]  We want to hear what they have to say.
[01:33:54.363 --> 01:33:59.566]  And actually, the phone lines are lighting up with people who agree with eugenics.
[01:33:59.606 --> 01:34:01.507]  Let's go to the very first one, James in New York.
[01:34:01.527 --> 01:34:02.107]  James, are you there?
[01:34:02.127 --> 01:34:04.248]  How you doing?
[01:34:04.605 --> 01:34:07.807]  Hey, do you think that Hitler gave eugenics a bad name?
[01:34:07.827 --> 01:34:18.434]  I can't really speak on Hitler, but you know, I just want to bring a different perspective to the conversation, especially about abortion.
[01:34:18.995 --> 01:34:26.680]  I really do believe people should have the right, you know, to have the right ability to have an abortion, you know.
[01:34:27.841 --> 01:34:49.066]  Especially in these urban neighborhoods, you know, every time you turn around, when I just got out of high school, every time I turn around you see a 16 year old girl pregnant, a 17 year old girl pregnant, and you don't know for many different reasons, for lack of family support, environment, states, and when children are born into that environment,
[01:34:49.890 --> 01:34:51.211]  It's just not fair to the child.
[01:34:51.271 --> 01:34:52.832]  Well, what do you think about North Carolina?
[01:34:52.872 --> 01:34:56.595]  They went into the ghettos and they forcibly sterilized specifically black women.
[01:34:57.116 --> 01:34:58.557]  And they said they were unfit to breed.
[01:34:58.577 --> 01:34:59.578]  Do you think that's a good idea?
[01:34:59.598 --> 01:35:03.181]  No, that's not... I'm not saying that.
[01:35:03.641 --> 01:35:11.827]  But I do believe people should have the right to have an abortion, especially when you know that you're the child that you're going to be bringing into the situation.
[01:35:12.388 --> 01:35:16.291]  You know, it's not going to be... The situation is not going to be right for the child.
[01:35:16.471 --> 01:35:18.592]  Well, you know, James, what about adoption?
[01:35:18.973 --> 01:35:20.454]  I've got two adopted children.
[01:35:20.474 --> 01:35:23.696]  I know a lot of people who want to adopt children, and it's not very easy.
[01:35:23.716 --> 01:35:32.981]  As a matter of fact, in North Carolina, we were forbidden, at the time we were looking to adopt, we were forbidden from adopting multiracial children.
[01:35:33.622 --> 01:35:35.783]  I know some friends now who have been able to do that.
[01:35:35.823 --> 01:35:37.244]  They adopted a sibling group.
[01:35:37.284 --> 01:35:41.027]  They were a white couple, and they adopted some black siblings.
[01:35:41.507 --> 01:35:42.548]  What about adoption?
[01:35:42.688 --> 01:35:44.649]  Isn't that an option for the children, instead of killing them?
[01:35:46.445 --> 01:35:53.067]  Um, adoption isn't out yet, but when you put adoption, you don't know who is going to end up with the kid.
[01:35:53.587 --> 01:35:55.968]  You got all this pedophilia going around.
[01:35:56.148 --> 01:35:57.629]  You don't know who's going to end up with your kid.
[01:35:57.649 --> 01:36:03.491]  I mean, of course you have people who come out of adoption situations.
[01:36:07.301 --> 01:36:18.886]  I don't think James, I think James agrees with abortion, which I think is part of eugenics, but I don't think he overall agrees with the whole concept of forced sterilizations and selective breeding.
[01:36:19.146 --> 01:36:24.148]  Yeah, but you know abortion came out of eugenicist philosophy.
[01:36:24.168 --> 01:36:26.549]  Margaret Sanger was very clear that she started abortion.
[01:36:27.069 --> 01:36:32.031]  It was targeted towards black families and we've got a great documentary here, MAFA 21.
[01:36:32.451 --> 01:36:33.411]  Ask James something.
[01:36:33.551 --> 01:36:35.232]  James, are you black?
[01:36:36.923 --> 01:36:37.423]  Yes I am.
[01:36:37.924 --> 01:36:43.189]  Do you not think there's a direct assault on black people with in regards to abortion?
[01:36:43.209 --> 01:36:46.992]  I mean what is it 40 million babies predominantly black killed?
[01:36:47.032 --> 01:36:48.634]  I mean do you think it's a good idea though?
[01:36:48.694 --> 01:36:50.436]  You're saying it's actually a good idea to go in.
[01:36:51.956 --> 01:36:54.558]  It's a lot of direct assaults against black people.
[01:36:54.578 --> 01:36:57.200]  We'd go for days about that.
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:59.502]  So why do you support abortions?
[01:36:59.582 --> 01:37:06.388]  I mean, if anything, it is a bunch of rich white men going in and saying we need to kill black babies.
[01:37:07.389 --> 01:37:09.551]  I mean, how are you supporting that?
[01:37:09.671 --> 01:37:11.013]  That's how Planned Parenthood started.
[01:37:11.033 --> 01:37:11.914]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:12.094 --> 01:37:15.477]  In fact, Margaret Sanger, I believe, was extremely racist.
[01:37:16.659 --> 01:37:19.502]  They would use the most racist terms I've ever heard in my life.
[01:37:19.622 --> 01:37:23.346]  And it amazes me that it's some issue of women's rights now.
[01:37:23.886 --> 01:37:30.328]  It's some issue of, you're racist if you're against abortion when they're targeting predominantly black babies and black families.
[01:37:30.528 --> 01:37:33.749]  As a matter of fact, there's a whole documentary that we sell here at InfoWars called MAFA 21.
[01:37:33.989 --> 01:37:34.349]  Yeah.
[01:37:35.029 --> 01:37:40.291]  That was done by Mark Crutcher, the guy who discovered this abortionist in Houston who's killing live babies.
[01:37:41.091 --> 01:37:47.998]  It focuses entirely on the war against the black community as being the source of the abortion industry.
[01:37:48.019 --> 01:37:49.880]  James, why have you let them break you down?
[01:37:50.321 --> 01:37:52.583]  Why do you not think they're capable of having a child?
[01:37:52.683 --> 01:37:59.490]  I mean, you're telling me that you believe that it's good that these black girls get abortions because they're not fit to have a child at age 16.
[01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:03.714]  Why aren't we talking about abortions in upscale, rich yacht communities?
[01:38:03.754 --> 01:38:04.414]  I mean, what's the difference?
[01:38:04.615 --> 01:38:05.415]  You're letting them win.
[01:38:05.675 --> 01:38:07.236]  You're letting them break you down, man.
[01:38:07.297 --> 01:38:09.818]  You have the power to take care of a family.
[01:38:09.838 --> 01:38:10.939]  You have all that power.
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.162]  You don't need the government to come in and run your life and kill your babies.
[01:38:15.483 --> 01:38:16.483]  Is it not an attack on you?
[01:38:16.504 --> 01:38:21.848]  If you had to come into the urban neighborhood, how about you do your life over?
[01:38:23.028 --> 01:38:26.151]  And being born into that environment?
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.762]  Well, that's this whole idea that children are bad.
[01:38:29.842 --> 01:38:31.123]  Children are not bad.
[01:38:31.263 --> 01:38:32.204]  Children are a gift.
[01:38:32.224 --> 01:38:32.905]  Children... No, not at all.
[01:38:33.485 --> 01:38:34.005]  Not at all.
[01:38:34.386 --> 01:38:41.992]  But if the mother is 16 years old, barely has an education, I think she still has a chance.
[01:38:42.132 --> 01:38:43.293]  Everybody makes mistakes.
[01:38:43.473 --> 01:38:48.077]  She should definitely have a chance to, you know, have an abortion.
[01:38:48.117 --> 01:38:51.100]  If you make that argument... It's just not... It's just not... It's not...
[01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:59.276]  It's a lot of girls who are 16 and they raise their children and it comes out a good situation.
[01:38:59.597 --> 01:39:02.740]  But I know, I'm from Brooklyn, New York, I see it.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:03.941]  I see it.
[01:39:05.017 --> 01:39:06.238]  I understand where you're coming from James.
[01:39:06.398 --> 01:39:08.840]  We need to move on to another caller, but I just want to say this one thing.
[01:39:34.957 --> 01:39:36.617]  This is a response.
[01:39:36.657 --> 01:39:38.598]  This is not, now the debate is, should we get an abortion?
[01:39:38.618 --> 01:39:39.058]  It should be.
[01:39:39.418 --> 01:39:40.338]  Why is this even happening?
[01:39:40.378 --> 01:39:41.439]  Why is the culture being destroyed?
[01:39:41.459 --> 01:39:43.019]  We need to reclaim it.
[01:39:43.039 --> 01:39:50.501]  It's also a slippery slope of saying that quality of life is the determining factor as to whether or not somebody should even have life.
[01:39:50.541 --> 01:39:52.302]  And then what's a good quality of life?
[01:39:52.442 --> 01:39:52.842]  Exactly.
[01:39:52.882 --> 01:39:58.143]  If we have somebody who has some kind of a physical challenge, do we then kill them?
[01:39:58.203 --> 01:40:02.004]  Because, you know, they don't really have as good a life as I would have.
[01:40:02.024 --> 01:40:03.485]  Let's say that they're in a wheelchair.
[01:40:04.285 --> 01:40:05.905]  Let's go to Dennis in Texas.
[01:40:05.965 --> 01:40:08.006]  Dennis, what do you think about this?
[01:40:08.026 --> 01:40:10.586]  Do you think about sterilized 13-year-olds or something like that?
[01:40:11.607 --> 01:40:14.367]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:40:14.787 --> 01:40:23.769]  I've seen so many 13-year-olds having so many kids and the parents allowing that and making it available to be okay.
[01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:28.290]  And you need to weigh that out, okay?
[01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:31.851]  Now, if you lived in my community, you'd be so disgusted.
[01:40:32.762 --> 01:40:34.783]  You know, I live in a rural community, okay?
[01:40:36.305 --> 01:40:38.426]  And you would not believe what I see.
[01:40:39.087 --> 01:40:40.308]  It's a heartache every day.
[01:40:40.328 --> 01:40:49.114]  Now, I'm not saying, like, hey, you know, let's kill them because they're retarded or they're mentally deficient.
[01:40:49.514 --> 01:40:51.636]  Let's make their lives extremely comfortable.
[01:40:52.436 --> 01:40:55.619]  Let's make them okay to live within their means.
[01:40:59.642 --> 01:41:05.027]  And you fix them by sterilizing them and taking away their right to produce and actually live and have a family.
[01:41:05.948 --> 01:41:06.588]  And who?
[01:41:06.689 --> 01:41:11.813]  I mean, are you for the just across the board sterilization of 13 year olds without their permission?
[01:41:13.375 --> 01:41:23.044]  Hey, if they got a problem, that means that they're not going to be socially adept into the ability to live a normal life.
[01:41:24.006 --> 01:41:27.008]  Who makes that determination, though?
[01:41:27.568 --> 01:41:30.950]  And once we set up some standards, what keeps those standards from sliding?
[01:41:32.051 --> 01:41:33.211]  Well, let's look at this.
[01:41:33.271 --> 01:41:44.798]  Now, I saw this one little ad in some CNN thing where there's this lady in England, and she decides that she's going to marry some autistic guy.
[01:41:46.119 --> 01:41:47.860]  And she was looking forward to having children.
[01:41:48.672 --> 01:41:50.254]  Dennis, Dennis, let me ask you a question.
[01:41:50.294 --> 01:41:51.216]  Have you ever been depressed?
[01:41:51.276 --> 01:41:51.776]  Are you crazy?
[01:41:51.796 --> 01:41:52.457]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:41:52.477 --> 01:41:53.939]  Have you ever been depressed in your life?
[01:41:55.361 --> 01:41:56.884]  No, I don't get depressed because I'm too busy.
[01:41:56.904 --> 01:41:58.165]  You've never felt sad?
[01:41:58.286 --> 01:42:00.669]  You've never felt sad before and down, just kind of depressed?
[01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:03.072]  No, no, I'm too busy.
[01:42:03.433 --> 01:42:05.576]  Dennis, have you ever questioned the government?
[01:42:07.111 --> 01:42:07.391]  Always.
[01:42:07.411 --> 01:42:07.431]  24-7.
[01:42:25.046 --> 01:42:26.927]  You are actually mentally ill.
[01:42:27.387 --> 01:42:28.627]  Oppositional defiant disorder.
[01:42:28.647 --> 01:42:35.870]  What we need to do is if you're mentally ill, then you're unfit to breed because your children then could become mentally ill.
[01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:40.651]  I mean, genealogically, if you're questioning the government, it's very possible your children could question the government.
[01:42:40.951 --> 01:42:42.872]  Therefore, you are unfit to breed, Dennis.
[01:42:42.952 --> 01:42:45.333]  It doesn't matter about any of your other qualities.
[01:42:45.533 --> 01:42:47.093]  You are mentally ill.
[01:42:47.854 --> 01:42:50.454]  So, do you understand now how this works?
[01:42:50.654 --> 01:42:52.095]  You are mentally ill and you are unfit to breed.
[01:42:52.395 --> 01:42:57.146]  I'm taking it on the upside down because what you're trying to do to me is you're trying to make me...
[01:42:57.813 --> 01:43:07.881]  Take away from the reality of the situation to look at to where... Well, no, the reality of the situation is that the psychiatric Bible says those who question the government are mentally ill.
[01:43:08.081 --> 01:43:15.387]  And you're in the same paradigm as someone who might have autism or someone who might actually be suicidal or have schizophrenia.
[01:43:15.787 --> 01:43:18.169]  It's all the same distinction of mental illness.
[01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:20.471]  If you are depressed, you are mentally ill.
[01:43:20.911 --> 01:43:25.635]  If you have thoughts of aggression, which pharmaceutical drugs give you, you are mentally ill.
[01:43:26.235 --> 01:43:31.220]  And then you'll be given pharmaceutical drugs which give you more psychiatric symptoms which make you further mentally ill.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:36.005]  Therefore, 1 in 10 people now are having mainline mental illness.
[01:43:36.665 --> 01:43:41.290]  50% of people in their lifetime will be taking drugs for that and will be perceived as mentally ill.
[01:43:41.630 --> 01:43:46.692]  And as every iteration of the DSM comes out, more and more people are considered crazy and mentally ill.
[01:43:47.012 --> 01:43:54.335]  So when we go and we say that these people mentally aren't fit to breed, 99% of everyone that's saying that can also be classified as unfit to breed.
[01:43:54.355 --> 01:43:55.115]  Do you see how that works?
[01:43:55.335 --> 01:44:05.879]  So when you start pushing the precedent, that yeah, maybe we should sterilize these certain types of people, anyone that's saying that, chances are, unless you're one of the 500 elite that are exempt from this, you're going to be sterilized as well.
[01:44:06.559 --> 01:44:07.119]  It doesn't matter.
[01:44:07.139 --> 01:44:09.980]  It's all the same class and that's how Obamacare works as well.
[01:44:10.241 --> 01:44:21.565]  The whole system, the idea that these people that think you're crazy and want to kill you are going to give you health care for free and going to give you a system that enhances your health is a massive joke.
[01:44:21.925 --> 01:44:25.907]  But before we go, because we've got to move on, we somehow have so many people to support eugenics.
[01:44:26.287 --> 01:44:27.968]  Did Hitler give eugenics a bad name?
[01:44:30.389 --> 01:44:30.929]  No, he didn't.
[01:44:31.549 --> 01:44:31.949]  Not at all.
[01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:32.670]  No, he didn't.
[01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:34.010]  Okay.
[01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:35.090]  Thank you very much.
[01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:35.591]  Go ahead.
[01:44:35.631 --> 01:44:36.371]  Go ahead.
[01:44:38.755 --> 01:44:39.776]  Alright, let's move on to the next one then.
[01:44:39.816 --> 01:44:39.976]  Yeah.
[01:44:40.096 --> 01:44:42.178]  Let's go to Andrew in Massachusetts.
[01:44:42.258 --> 01:44:42.858]  Andrew, are you there?
[01:44:46.001 --> 01:44:46.381]  Okay.
[01:44:47.963 --> 01:44:50.024]  Okay, let's go to Howie in Pennsylvania.
[01:44:52.226 --> 01:44:52.486]  Hello.
[01:44:53.327 --> 01:44:54.988]  Hey, Howie, what do you think about that?
[01:44:55.028 --> 01:44:56.549]  Did Hitler give eugenics a bad name?
[01:44:57.891 --> 01:45:08.179]  That's kind of a trick question, but I'm just going to skip over that and say I do think that sterilization should be implemented because, you know,
[01:45:08.692 --> 01:45:09.993]  Anything can be good.
[01:45:10.493 --> 01:45:12.394]  It depends who's in charge of it.
[01:45:12.534 --> 01:45:20.738]  I think that we should be in charge of it, and say that anybody that wrote a white paper about sterilizing people en masse, they should be sterilized.
[01:45:21.799 --> 01:45:23.060]  Well, you know what, Howie, you're right.
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:32.364]  You're funny, because I knew we would get at least... Because here's the reality, I mean, any sane individual, like actually real, awake individual, agrees that eugenics is a bad idea.
[01:45:32.384 --> 01:45:33.725]  I mean, across the board.
[01:45:33.745 --> 01:45:36.887]  I mean, agrees that, yeah, Hitler was not right.
[01:45:37.367 --> 01:45:46.112]  But apparently a small section of people actually do think, as we've seen from these comments, I mean thousands of people upvoting it saying, yeah, Hilder gave the eugenics a bad name, we should sterilize all 13-year-olds.
[01:45:46.672 --> 01:45:50.234]  But, I mean, the reality is anyone saying that should sterilize themselves.
[01:45:50.835 --> 01:45:52.035]  I mean, isn't that right, Howie?
[01:45:52.055 --> 01:45:56.738]  You think anyone saying that we should sterilize people and have abortions up to age 5, well they should just do it themselves then.
[01:45:56.758 --> 01:45:57.918]  They should just kill themselves, huh?
[01:45:58.599 --> 01:45:59.499]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[01:45:59.539 --> 01:46:00.340]  You first, buddy.
[01:46:01.325 --> 01:46:02.706]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:46:02.726 --> 01:46:08.730]  Well, let's thank you for some realism here, but let's talk to someone else who believes that Taylor is right.
[01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:10.291]  Let's talk to Don in Connecticut.
[01:46:10.311 --> 01:46:14.033]  Now, Don, you said that you think because of the welfare state that we should have eugenics?
[01:46:15.614 --> 01:46:16.795]  Well, they go together.
[01:46:18.096 --> 01:46:18.596]  They go together?
[01:46:18.616 --> 01:46:26.081]  Well, if you're going to have half the people in this country on welfare, then what else are we going to do?
[01:46:26.381 --> 01:46:28.002]  How about we abort the welfare state?
[01:46:29.210 --> 01:46:33.053]  I consider abortion to be justifiable homicide.
[01:46:33.113 --> 01:46:34.754]  I am pro-choice, definitely.
[01:46:35.335 --> 01:46:37.436]  But I do not believe in eugenics.
[01:46:37.637 --> 01:46:39.418]  No, it should be the individual who died.
[01:46:39.438 --> 01:46:40.699]  Justifiable.
[01:46:40.739 --> 01:46:43.321]  Wait, wait, yeah, let's probe that a little bit.
[01:46:43.541 --> 01:46:48.545]  So if I were to go up to a pregnant woman and stab her in the stomach and kill her baby, should I go to jail?
[01:46:49.205 --> 01:46:57.712]  What's going to end up happening if people don't get the connection, if they don't get the connection between this unlimited welfare state
[01:46:59.132 --> 01:47:10.163]  We have limited resources and you all of a sudden you're going to let everybody who wants my money have it for whatever reason.
[01:47:10.383 --> 01:47:12.485]  So you think we should just kill everyone on welfare?
[01:47:14.307 --> 01:47:18.351]  Because they go together and people need to connect that.
[01:47:18.371 --> 01:47:23.016]  They need to understand that if you're going to have a state that
[01:47:24.144 --> 01:47:26.566]  You know, you get to claim my money.
[01:47:27.226 --> 01:47:29.848]  So we should just kill everyone who's on welfare?
[01:47:30.048 --> 01:47:33.230]  Listen, if Hitler said kill everyone on welfare, do you think that's a good idea?
[01:47:33.930 --> 01:47:34.731]  So much money!
[01:47:36.592 --> 01:47:42.615]  Now, explain to us why you would say that that's homicide, but it's justifiable homicide.
[01:47:43.216 --> 01:47:45.917]  And do you put any limits on that as far as what age?
[01:47:45.937 --> 01:47:48.239]  The reality is, it is murder.
[01:47:49.028 --> 01:47:55.729]  I mean, I'm pro-choice, and I will admit, it's murder, but it's a justifiable homicide.
[01:47:56.329 --> 01:48:02.330]  Up to what age would you... It's my body, it's my choice.
[01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:06.231]  What about the choice of the child that you're committing homicide on?
[01:48:06.491 --> 01:48:08.011]  What age would you take that to?
[01:48:08.051 --> 01:48:15.512]  Would you stop that at three months or three years, or at what point should we have justifiable homicide of children?
[01:48:16.633 --> 01:48:18.193]  You know, every case is different.
[01:48:19.832 --> 01:48:21.573]  Oh, wow.
[01:48:21.834 --> 01:48:27.559]  So... I mean, it should skeeve you out.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:28.780]  Definitely.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:31.042]  Because it's homicide.
[01:48:32.484 --> 01:48:33.585]  It should bother you.
[01:48:33.625 --> 01:48:35.306]  It shouldn't be the way it is now.
[01:48:35.407 --> 01:48:37.889]  People, you know, using it for birth control.
[01:48:39.330 --> 01:48:40.892]  I should give people a heads up.
[01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:48.732]  I took somebody to Planned Parenthood for an abortion who swear that they did not mess up.
[01:48:48.792 --> 01:48:50.893]  They took their birth control pills.
[01:48:52.114 --> 01:49:00.838]  And I'm sitting there in the waiting room with probably 14 other women who also swear that they took their birth control pills.
[01:49:01.318 --> 01:49:10.143]  Somebody needs to investigate Planned Parenthood because that's the very source of the birth control pills these women had.
[01:49:11.121 --> 01:49:23.627]  Well, let me ask you, since you say that you're okay with homicide, I mean, are you okay with what this Houston doctor is accused of where the children are born alive and he twists the head off the child?
[01:49:23.647 --> 01:49:24.367]  You're okay with that?
[01:49:24.387 --> 01:49:26.488]  It's so disgusting.
[01:49:26.548 --> 01:49:28.269]  It's ridiculous.
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:38.724]  I imagine that guy, that manifestation of sadism that's being, you know, public like that.
[01:49:38.744 --> 01:49:46.548]  So only some killing of babies is justifiable homicide, but other kind of killing of children is not that good, right?
[01:49:47.188 --> 01:49:47.308]  No.
[01:49:49.276 --> 01:49:49.496]  Okay.
[01:49:50.237 --> 01:49:55.962]  So basically, whatever doesn't emotionally hurt you as bad, that's, you know, that's okay.
[01:49:56.103 --> 01:49:59.005]  But if it emotionally hurts you, then that's not justifiable.
[01:49:59.045 --> 01:50:12.678]  So, law should basically be written based on the emotions of its citizenry, and that, you know, that offends me that that baby was killed in that circumstance, but, you know, backyard McDonald's abortions that are now legal, you know, that's okay.
[01:50:12.998 --> 01:50:13.599]  Those are fine.
[01:50:14.039 --> 01:50:16.260]  So, we appreciate your call.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:28.045]  We want to get to more people who are into eugenics, but the basic idea that it's justifiable in some cases and not so much in the other ones, it's just complete nonsense based on absolutely no foundation of anything.
[01:50:28.065 --> 01:50:36.688]  And that's what happens when you go away from reality, you go away from the Constitution, you go away from principles that we've followed for hundreds if not thousands of years, and you take it and you say, well,
[01:50:37.288 --> 01:50:40.751]  I feel this way about one thing and my emotions are over here on another one.
[01:50:40.791 --> 01:50:42.151]  It gets completely tossed up.
[01:50:42.472 --> 01:50:45.534]  Well, they're not really different separate areas either.
[01:50:45.834 --> 01:50:51.298]  They overlap into each other because Margaret Sanger who started abortion talked about quality of life issues.
[01:50:51.658 --> 01:50:52.959]  She was also a eugenicist.
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:00.303]  Abortion, eugenics, they all overlap with each other and they reinforce each other.
[01:51:00.343 --> 01:51:00.703]  Exactly.
[01:51:00.763 --> 01:51:04.205]  Obamacare is the way that it's going to happen, just as we saw Bill Gates talking about that.
[01:51:04.545 --> 01:51:08.427]  We're going to be right back and we're going to be talking to Bill still about the Federal Reserve.
[01:51:09.588 --> 01:51:12.049]  My name is Frank Bates and I got a confession to make.
[01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:19.933]  Just a few days ago, FEMA went directly to my supplier and tried to buy my entire stockpile of high quality survival food.
[01:51:20.454 --> 01:51:24.156]  It sounds crazy, but I'll show you the exact letter they sent in a minute.
[01:51:24.716 --> 01:51:30.420]  Revealing FEMA's plot could land me in hot water and I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:40.306]  Go to FEMAHatesThis.com to see undeniable video proof that the government is on the hunt for as much survival food as they can grab in 24 hours.
[01:51:40.706 --> 01:51:46.450]  Be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't.
[01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:57.633]  Go to FemaHatesThis.com to see why survival food is the number one item to hoard right now and why supplies are so low or even completely sold out already at many stores across America.
[01:51:57.833 --> 01:52:04.715]  Do it now because I don't know how long it will be online so go to FemaHatesThis.com while you can.
[01:52:05.135 --> 01:52:06.996]  That's FemaHatesThis.com.
[01:52:08.823 --> 01:52:09.544]  My name's Bruno.
[01:52:09.684 --> 01:52:10.785]  I'm 52 years old.
[01:52:11.046 --> 01:52:14.590]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[01:52:14.670 --> 01:52:16.732]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[01:52:16.952 --> 01:52:22.518]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[01:52:22.919 --> 01:52:24.481]  My body has changed dramatically.
[01:52:25.041 --> 01:52:25.681]  I'm a cyclist.
[01:52:25.941 --> 01:52:28.462]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[01:52:28.962 --> 01:52:38.726]  After being on One World Way, I rode ten days in a row in over 100 degree heat, and then I'd take another two servings of One World Way, and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[01:52:39.086 --> 01:52:40.787]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[01:52:41.287 --> 01:52:44.808]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[01:52:45.468 --> 01:52:46.589]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:48.589]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[01:52:48.990 --> 01:52:49.890]  Just give it a try.
[01:52:50.495 --> 01:52:53.538]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325.
[01:52:53.578 --> 01:52:53.899]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:52:53.919 --> 01:52:54.359]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:52:54.459 --> 01:52:55.260]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.341]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:53:08.815 --> 01:53:13.916]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:53:14.276 --> 01:53:22.759]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:53:23.159 --> 01:53:30.461]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:53:31.001 --> 01:53:38.383]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:53:38.883 --> 01:53:42.284]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:53:42.845 --> 01:53:46.486]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[01:53:47.026 --> 01:53:53.629]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[01:53:54.189 --> 01:54:00.912]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front.
[01:54:01.392 --> 01:54:05.434]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[01:54:09.065 --> 01:54:13.108]  We're good to go.
[01:54:41.221 --> 01:54:42.702]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:42.802 --> 01:54:46.886]  I'm David Knight and we're going to change gears radically here.
[01:54:46.946 --> 01:54:53.551]  We're going to go from talking about justifiable homicide, as this lady called abortions.
[01:54:53.731 --> 01:54:58.775]  I think we've got a lot of callers who are going to hold on the line to talk to us about this after we talk to Bill Still.
[01:54:59.616 --> 01:55:04.100]  But he's been very patiently waiting to talk to us about his film about the Federal Reserve.
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.642]  This is the 100th anniversary
[01:55:07.542 --> 01:55:07.983]  I think so.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:32.544]  Bill still has many films that you may have seen.
[01:55:32.604 --> 01:55:34.206]  He has The Secret of Oz.
[01:55:34.726 --> 01:55:37.289]  He is a former newspaper editor and publisher.
[01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:42.515]  He's written for USA Today, The Saturday Evening Post, LA Times, and Omni Magazine.
[01:55:43.997 --> 01:55:44.498]  Bill, are you there?
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:47.100]  Hello?
[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:49.521]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[01:55:49.702 --> 01:55:50.602]  Hey Bill, how you doing?
[01:55:51.082 --> 01:55:52.063]  I'm doing well, thank you.
[01:55:52.403 --> 01:55:58.666]  I just saw your film, Jekyll Island, and it's really timely with the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve.
[01:55:59.407 --> 01:56:03.249]  I think it's really, really an amazing story that people need to see.
[01:56:03.289 --> 01:56:05.430]  They need to understand the history of how we got this.
[01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:07.151]  They need to understand the implications of this.
[01:56:07.211 --> 01:56:12.914]  As you pointed out, there's a couple of things that have really ruined country after country throughout history.
[01:56:12.954 --> 01:56:15.115]  That's a fractional reserve lending system.
[01:56:15.775 --> 01:56:20.779]  Yeah, really.
[01:56:20.919 --> 01:56:31.527]  The two major problems with the world economy and the economy of every nation are number one, government borrowing, and number two, fractional reserve lending.
[01:56:31.947 --> 01:56:34.509]  They are two distinct forces.
[01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:41.455]  But the first problem that I would try to go fix is we don't need to just pay down the national debt.
[01:56:41.495 --> 01:56:44.537]  We need to eliminate the ability of the federal government to borrow.
[01:56:45.678 --> 01:56:50.883]  Because the borrower, as the Bible says in Proverbs, the borrower becomes servant to the lender.
[01:56:51.463 --> 01:57:03.780]  And so therefore, you have instead of a republic or a democratic republic or a constitutional republic, you have nothing but a plutocracy that is ruled by the banking class.
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:07.965]  And this is what humanity has tried to escape for the last 2,000 years.
[01:57:09.367 --> 01:57:17.813]  And we're rapidly devolving now, back in the last 50 years, towards less freedom, towards more centralized control.
[01:57:18.253 --> 01:57:25.077]  And I'm not just talking about centralized control of government, I'm talking about centralized control by the debt-based banking system.
[01:57:26.358 --> 01:57:40.808]  The reason most of us think that government is no longer responsive to we, the people, is because they are now completely responsive and subservient to those to whom they owe this debt, namely the largest commercial banks.
[01:57:41.548 --> 01:57:54.637]  It's amazing in your film, Jekyll Island, you go back in quite a ways into history, especially back to the Napoleonic times, the Louisiana Purchase, and how the Rothschild family got in control of
[01:57:56.460 --> 01:58:01.142]  Major countries in Europe, but then you take it forward to when the Federal Reserve was created.
[01:58:01.222 --> 01:58:07.245]  It's kind of interesting, this secret train ride on Senator Aldrich's private Pullman car that's black.
[01:58:07.265 --> 01:58:09.086]  I like the way the documentary starts out with that.
[01:58:09.727 --> 01:58:22.033]  This is something that was set up to stop the rapid, what they call the business cycle, the boom and bust cycles, and yet the Federal Reserve hasn't really worked out too well in terms of that, has it?
[01:58:23.256 --> 01:58:24.356]  No, it hasn't.
[01:58:24.516 --> 01:58:28.517]  In fact, just 16 years after the creation of the Federal Reserve, what did we have?
[01:58:28.897 --> 01:58:32.278]  We had the largest crash in U.S.
[01:58:32.318 --> 01:58:36.019]  history, leading to the deepest depression of the 20th century.
[01:58:36.499 --> 01:58:43.280]  So, and interestingly enough, there's this rumor going around that the Fed has... We're going to come back.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:43.860]  Hang on, Bill.
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:45.821]  We're going to be right back, right after the break.
[01:58:45.861 --> 01:58:46.481]  Stay tuned, you guys.
[01:58:46.501 --> 01:58:47.521]  You'll hear the rest of the story.

[01:58:58.837 --> 01:59:04.441]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:59:04.641 --> 01:59:11.867]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:59:12.027 --> 01:59:15.190]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:59:15.370 --> 01:59:17.151]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:59:17.391 --> 01:59:21.974]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:24.816]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:59:24.976 --> 01:59:30.760]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:34.402]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:59:34.602 --> 01:59:39.665]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[02:00:13.686 --> 02:00:14.327]  Big Brother.
[02:00:15.008 --> 02:00:16.029]  Mainstream media.

[02:00:20.114 --> 02:00:21.015]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.656 --> 02:00:25.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:25.861 --> 02:00:29.926]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.441 --> 02:00:37.603]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[02:00:38.424 --> 02:00:46.892]  Filling in for Alex, and we've got on the phone with us documentary filmmaker Bill Still, who just completed the documentary film Jekyll Island.
[02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:50.375]  And Jekyll Island tells the story of the Federal Reserve...
[02:00:50.996 --> 02:00:56.600]  It really kind of underscores the fact that the Federal Reserve is not federal, and they don't really have any reserves.
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:05.926]  And it's something that was created to solve the problem of the business cycle, but it actually has made it quite bad, as Bill was just saying before we went to break.
[02:01:06.907 --> 02:01:17.274]  Bill, as they came in and set up the Federal Reserve, it was only just a few years after that we had the Great Depression, one of the largest depressions, of course, the worst economic situation the world has seen worldwide.
[02:01:18.739 --> 02:01:22.543]  Well, yeah, worldwide, but that was not the deepest depression in U.S.
[02:01:22.563 --> 02:01:22.943]  history.
[02:01:23.023 --> 02:01:34.312]  The years after the Civil War were actually the deepest depression if you look at it from a percentage of money disappearing from the U.S.
[02:01:34.353 --> 02:01:34.833]  economy.
[02:01:34.873 --> 02:01:36.294]  I think it was 84%.
[02:01:36.935 --> 02:01:39.977]  The money in the system was reduced by 84% during those 30 years.
[02:01:42.399 --> 02:01:53.785]  And this led up to, the bankers caused a series of booms and busts to try to justify bringing a massive centralized system, the Federal Reserve System.
[02:01:54.246 --> 02:01:55.826]  And that's really how we got it.
[02:01:56.147 --> 02:02:04.391]  As I was getting ready to say before the break, there's a rumor going around that the Fed has a hundred year charter and that's going to come up.
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:06.661]  Uh, here on December 23rd.
[02:02:06.781 --> 02:02:07.882]  That's just not the case.
[02:02:09.183 --> 02:02:16.828]  Initially, it was given only a 20-year charter, and there's a reason in corporate rulemaking because the Fed is a corporation.
[02:02:16.888 --> 02:02:18.809]  They did admit that when they changed the law in 1927.
[02:02:21.391 --> 02:02:26.793]  There's some rule in corporate America that you don't want a corporation to last over 20 years.
[02:02:26.833 --> 02:02:39.479]  So they made the Fed, they gave the Fed a 20-year charter, and then after only 13 years they decided, well, we're going to jump in there and change it and make it indeterminate as the law states.
[02:02:39.539 --> 02:02:44.342]  So in 1927 that was changed and the Fed now has a perpetual charter.
[02:02:45.582 --> 02:02:47.123]  So how do we get rid of the Fed?
[02:02:48.708 --> 02:02:58.797]  Well, it's going to take tremendous public awareness, and I personally don't think it's going to happen until a lot more pain has been applied to the U.S.
[02:02:58.837 --> 02:02:59.297]  economy.
[02:02:59.357 --> 02:03:07.104]  Right now, we're in the mother of all bubbles with the stock market, and at some point, that's got to collapse.
[02:03:07.144 --> 02:03:09.526]  You just can't continue to expand
[02:03:10.326 --> 02:03:18.392]  The money supply logarithmically, and yet even now we see unemployment rates and money going to the middle class.
[02:03:18.432 --> 02:03:33.362]  The middle class economic experience is no better than flat, despite the fact that the Fed is pumping an unlimited, not an unlimited, but an unprecedented amount of money into the system, over a trillion dollars a year.
[02:03:33.382 --> 02:03:35.264]  This has never happened before in U.S.
[02:03:35.304 --> 02:03:36.605]  history, and still
[02:03:38.225 --> 02:03:39.606]  It's for the middle class.
[02:03:39.886 --> 02:03:41.026]  There's really no change.
[02:03:41.086 --> 02:03:43.947]  In fact, our purchasing power is continuing to go down.
[02:03:44.447 --> 02:03:50.489]  All this money is being concentrated to an ever greater degree in the hands of the banking class.
[02:03:51.069 --> 02:03:51.709]  And that's it.
[02:03:51.929 --> 02:03:53.189]  There's just no way around that.
[02:03:53.229 --> 02:03:55.250]  That is not going to turn around.
[02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:59.691]  It's going to do nothing but not only increase, but accelerate the rate of increase.
[02:04:00.211 --> 02:04:15.439]  Until the system collapses, and at that point, then we can finally have an opportunity for real change, because people will see that the solutions that have been offered in the past were lies, just as Mr. Obama's health care bill.
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:18.081]  So, that's the problem.
[02:04:18.101 --> 02:04:19.822]  We're going to have to have some more pain.
[02:04:20.262 --> 02:04:21.463]  And we've seen this in the past.
[02:04:21.503 --> 02:04:28.231]  We've seen the World Bank under Robert McNamara going in and getting third world nations totally inundated with national debt.
[02:04:28.771 --> 02:04:33.416]  And he was criticized, the World Bank was criticized, for what they called rent-seeking status.
[02:04:33.436 --> 02:04:38.562]  In other words, turning these, getting these countries so far in debt that they could never get out of it.
[02:04:38.582 --> 02:04:41.905]  And that's what we see happening throughout history, as your documentary points out.
[02:04:42.546 --> 02:04:49.090]  The banks will get countries so far into debt that they can never get out, and that's why they talk about turning everybody into renters.
[02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:52.933]  Well, thank you very much for joining us today, Bill, and I really appreciate that.
[02:04:53.013 --> 02:05:00.097]  That documentary is Jekyll Island, and as we approach the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve, find out about its true history.
[02:05:00.157 --> 02:05:03.059]  Find out that it's not really federal and there's no reserve.
[02:05:03.119 --> 02:05:06.121]  It's a private bank that is destroying our country financially.
[02:05:06.141 --> 02:05:07.262]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:09.525 --> 02:05:14.627]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:05:14.987 --> 02:05:23.451]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:05:23.871 --> 02:05:31.174]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:05:31.694 --> 02:05:39.097]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[02:05:39.597 --> 02:05:42.998]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[02:05:43.539 --> 02:05:47.180]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[02:08:25.859 --> 02:08:32.356]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:32.396 --> 02:08:33.860]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:39.002 --> 02:08:40.464]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:40.524 --> 02:08:41.925]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex.
[02:08:42.706 --> 02:08:59.904]  Now, if you caught the show in the last segment, we were talking about eugenics with Anthony Gucciardi of StoryLeak, and we were asking people if they agreed with eugenics, if they agreed with the comment stream that we found on Reddit that said that Hitler gave eugenics a bad name.
[02:09:00.504 --> 02:09:06.346]  And so we've been taking some calls from people who wanted to defend eugenics or to defend abortion.
[02:09:06.366 --> 02:09:10.688]  We just had a lady say that she thought that abortion was justifiable homicide.
[02:09:11.848 --> 02:09:19.571]  We couldn't really pin her down as to how it was justified, but we've got some other people on the line we'd like to talk to that I think support eugenics.
[02:09:19.611 --> 02:09:21.211]  We've got Kyle in Colorado.
[02:09:21.271 --> 02:09:24.552]  Kyle, what would you like to tell us about eugenics that you agree with?
[02:09:26.333 --> 02:09:26.613]  Hello?
[02:09:27.013 --> 02:09:27.693]  Hello, Kyle?
[02:09:28.534 --> 02:09:28.674]  Yes.
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:34.261]  I think I know the argument they're sort of trying to make, the people who support eugenics.
[02:09:35.581 --> 02:09:41.542]  And it's the fact that we don't have enough food in our world.
[02:09:41.582 --> 02:09:46.103]  We don't have enough, you know, resources as they say.
[02:09:48.224 --> 02:09:51.884]  China, you know, they go around and they only let the boys live.
[02:09:52.845 --> 02:09:59.726]  We have other cultures though who have had forced breeding, you know, the Tahitians.
[02:10:00.230 --> 02:10:02.225]  They'd have to go have sex with their, um...
[02:10:07.423 --> 02:10:20.911]  Well, you know, the argument that we don't have enough food and water for people to eat, that's something that was made by Malthus back in the 18th century, and that's something that's been proven over and over again to be wrong, because people don't just come into society as useless eaters.
[02:10:20.951 --> 02:10:22.952]  They actually produce things on their own.
[02:10:23.212 --> 02:10:26.654]  I mean, which ones of the kids do we get rid of?
[02:10:26.714 --> 02:10:28.295]  Do we get rid of the Teslas?
[02:10:28.555 --> 02:10:30.596]  Do we get rid of the Beethovens?
[02:10:30.636 --> 02:10:31.397]  Who do we get rid of?
[02:10:32.369 --> 02:10:32.929]  How do we know?
[02:10:32.949 --> 02:10:38.132]  I don't believe we... I mean, I'm a father myself, and you know, children are our future.
[02:10:38.612 --> 02:10:50.277]  What we need to do is come together as humans and respect the fact that what we're doing and the arguments that people have are just illusions per se.
[02:10:51.318 --> 02:10:53.279]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:10:53.359 --> 02:11:00.802]  I can't agree with state-run breeding like what the Spartans did or the Tahitians did, but I mean, it has produced
[02:11:01.474 --> 02:11:03.255]  Strong cultures over the centuries.
[02:11:04.036 --> 02:11:15.322]  I just believe that, you know, if you believe in, like, you know, murdering children and all that other stuff, you could just go to China, because that's what they do there all the time.
[02:11:15.342 --> 02:11:16.503]  Right.
[02:11:16.543 --> 02:11:17.904]  We've seen how that plays out.
[02:11:18.704 --> 02:11:20.465]  They're still doing it all over the world.
[02:11:20.485 --> 02:11:22.886]  So do we, like, argue that?
[02:11:23.047 --> 02:11:23.967]  Is it right?
[02:11:24.247 --> 02:11:27.049]  Or do we argue on how we need to stop it now?
[02:11:27.069 --> 02:11:28.750]  Because it's still going on.
[02:11:29.687 --> 02:11:30.268]  Well, absolutely.
[02:11:30.528 --> 02:11:30.948]  Absolutely.
[02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:32.009]  And we need to stop it.
[02:11:32.029 --> 02:11:33.511]  And we need to do something that's radical.
[02:11:33.591 --> 02:11:39.377]  As they asked Dan Savage, they said, come up with a radical, controversial idea to improve the planet.
[02:11:39.417 --> 02:11:45.223]  Well, I think maybe respecting people, individual liberty, individual dignity and freedom.
[02:11:45.323 --> 02:11:46.685]  You know, it was a radical idea.
[02:11:47.665 --> 02:11:48.026]  For B.F.
[02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:51.428]  Skinner to say that he was going to take away people's freedom and dignity.
[02:11:51.628 --> 02:11:54.990]  And it was a radical idea when Jefferson said that you can't do that.
[02:11:55.070 --> 02:12:00.253]  You can destroy somebody's life and their freedom, but you cannot disjoin those two things.
[02:12:00.293 --> 02:12:02.254]  They're essential to our personhood.
[02:12:02.715 --> 02:12:09.659]  And if you let somebody do that to someone who is weaker, someone who fits some arbitrary criteria, it's going to come back around to you.
[02:12:09.679 --> 02:12:11.520]  But let's see if somebody else wants to defend this.
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:13.361]  We've got Patty in Arizona.
[02:12:13.441 --> 02:12:15.943]  Patty, how do you feel about eugenics abortion?
[02:12:17.865 --> 02:12:26.411]  I feel that no man has the right to make that decision for another human being, that that is their God-given right to have children.
[02:12:26.891 --> 02:12:30.273]  I have a daughter who was diagnosed developmentally slow.
[02:12:30.313 --> 02:12:35.076]  She's now 25, but after she got married several years later, she got pregnant.
[02:12:35.997 --> 02:12:46.243]  And from the time she was nine, they had been telling me the county would come to me, send their health people, and say, uh, don't you think you should have her fixed?
[02:12:46.795 --> 02:12:48.657]  You know, she should never have children.
[02:12:48.677 --> 02:12:52.980]  And it was like, no, this is her decision, you know.
[02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:55.382]  And I had two beautiful granddaughters.
[02:12:55.422 --> 02:12:57.364]  They did not allow her to keep them.
[02:12:57.384 --> 02:13:06.792]  They fought her tooth and nail because they decided that wasn't going to happen, that she would not be an adequate parent.
[02:13:06.872 --> 02:13:13.077]  And she finally, after a year and a half after the first one, just gave up because they just
[02:13:13.763 --> 02:13:15.924]  It gave her so much trouble.
[02:13:16.024 --> 02:13:18.044]  So the state came by and confiscated her children?
[02:13:18.504 --> 02:13:19.104]  Because of what?
[02:13:19.124 --> 02:13:20.565]  Because of her IQ?
[02:13:20.585 --> 02:13:23.125]  I mean, were there specific instances that they cited?
[02:13:23.185 --> 02:13:25.306]  What did they do?
[02:13:26.186 --> 02:13:32.748]  Well, she was back in Minnesota, and they were telling her, oh, you're going to be a great little mom, and you're going to keep your baby.
[02:13:33.368 --> 02:13:37.689]  And I finally called back there and said, quit lying to my daughter, because I know you people.
[02:13:38.609 --> 02:13:42.070]  And you are going to take her baby the minute it's born.
[02:13:42.580 --> 02:13:44.081]  I said, you better go tell her the truth.
[02:13:44.161 --> 02:13:52.384]  So a week later, they went back there and told her the truth and said, the minute you have this child, we're going to let you hold it one time, and then we already have a home for it.
[02:13:52.944 --> 02:13:57.786]  But they were letting her think that she was going to be this great little mom and keep her child.
[02:13:58.466 --> 02:14:00.807]  And I finally told her, okay, come to Arizona.
[02:14:01.427 --> 02:14:11.071]  And she came here, but they had given her...wrote up all kinds of actually false statements about her from Minnesota.
[02:14:11.892 --> 02:14:14.695]  And they just kept at her.
[02:14:14.715 --> 02:14:22.082]  They'd let her... So it's kind of like a pre-crime thing, right?
[02:14:22.942 --> 02:14:23.923]  Based on who she was?
[02:14:23.983 --> 02:14:32.091]  I mean, if they're going to take the child at birth, then she hasn't, at that point, done anything to endanger the child.
[02:14:33.412 --> 02:14:34.353]  No, absolutely.
[02:14:34.473 --> 02:14:36.315]  And they kept saying... Well, anyway.
[02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:48.380]  She has two little daughters, and we've been very blessed that a foster mother has adopted both the children and has let her stay in their lives, and she gets to see them once a week.
[02:14:49.741 --> 02:14:53.805]  It wasn't going to matter what kind of hoop she jumped through.
[02:14:53.825 --> 02:14:55.927]  They were never going to let her keep those kids.
[02:14:56.427 --> 02:15:00.191]  But after she had her second child, she made the decision.
[02:15:02.185 --> 02:15:06.937]  To get sick, and that's what she wanted to do, and that was her choice.
[02:15:06.977 --> 02:15:07.979]  She was a grown woman.
[02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:10.005]  She was 24 years old, you know?
[02:15:11.434 --> 02:15:13.856]  Yeah, it was too heartbreaking for her to have her children taken away.
[02:15:13.896 --> 02:15:15.097]  Well, that's a sad story.
[02:15:15.137 --> 02:15:16.497]  Thank you for telling us that.
[02:15:17.338 --> 02:15:20.780]  We should always remember that every human life is precious.
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:27.125]  I know so many people who have had mentally handicapped children, children with Down syndrome.
[02:15:27.465 --> 02:15:30.367]  These are wonderful children if you love them.
[02:15:30.647 --> 02:15:34.650]  And any parent who has had a Down syndrome child will tell you that.
[02:15:35.290 --> 02:15:37.151]  That it really is
[02:15:37.992 --> 02:15:39.293]  Kind of what you make out of it.
[02:15:39.353 --> 02:15:49.419]  You know, God gives us different situations in life and they can be a wonderful situation or if we come at it with a different attitude and it's a very challenging situation.
[02:15:49.439 --> 02:16:03.128]  I'm not undermining how challenging this is, but I can tell you over and over again, parents that I know that have had children with health consequences or mental consequences and it's been one of the biggest blessings of their life, they'll tell you.
[02:16:03.948 --> 02:16:05.850]  Let's talk to Kyle in Maryland.
[02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:06.210]  Kyle?
[02:16:06.710 --> 02:16:08.291]  What do you think about eugenics?
[02:16:09.792 --> 02:16:21.219]  Alright, before I answer on whether or not I believe that Hitler gave eugenics a bad name, can I ask you what would be your definition of eugenics?
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.741]  What would be my definition of eugenics?
[02:16:25.799 --> 02:16:48.193]  Well, eugenics literally means to improve the gene pool, and typically when people do that, they have some criteria where they think that people that have particular characteristics, whether that is a racial characteristic, or whether those are characteristics of their mental capacity, or it might be their physical capacity, that those people should be, first of all, sterilized, and in many cases, put down.
[02:16:48.253 --> 02:16:49.875]  That's my understanding of eugenics.
[02:16:49.895 --> 02:16:50.275]  What's yours?
[02:16:51.454 --> 02:17:08.279]  Okay, so what you're saying is you think that eugenics is basically the physical or mental manipulation of humans into getting almost like an elite race or, you know, an elite humanity out of it.
[02:17:08.339 --> 02:17:08.959]  You get what I'm saying?
[02:17:09.419 --> 02:17:11.060]  Yeah, well, tell us what your definition of it is.
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.281]  Well, I would agree with you on that.
[02:17:15.761 --> 02:17:18.822]  See, what I'm saying, yes, I would say Hitler
[02:17:19.372 --> 02:17:28.460]  Did give eugenics a bad name, and I would say that because I believe eugenics can be used in a good way, i.e.
[02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:44.174]  through everybody getting the right nutrition, the right education, you know, people not getting these vaccines, people not getting these genetically modified foods, people, you know, not being subjected to this
[02:17:46.343 --> 02:17:46.884]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:18:00.971 --> 02:18:12.159]  True, but I would say that eugenics is not that broadly construed to say that it's just generally improving the human condition, whether it's health or environment or educational exposure.
[02:18:12.659 --> 02:18:24.807]  I think eugenics is very, very particular in terms of selecting out, not only selecting what is good, but selecting what is good by eliminating what you perceive to be as bad.
[02:18:24.827 --> 02:18:26.709]  Okay.
[02:18:27.089 --> 02:18:28.810]  And again, I agree with that.
[02:18:28.830 --> 02:18:29.831]  I mean, I perceive
[02:18:30.362 --> 02:18:32.983]  All these cancers, all these illnesses, all of them are bad.
[02:18:33.303 --> 02:18:36.864]  But through the type of eugenics, we can get rid of all these things.
[02:18:37.284 --> 02:18:42.726]  And, you know, obviously, I don't agree with forced sterilization, forced abortion, anything like that.
[02:18:43.486 --> 02:18:52.128]  And, you know, everybody's saying, oh, you have the right... I don't like to hear anybody say that, oh, you have the right, you have the free will to choose to kill your child.
[02:18:52.308 --> 02:18:56.349]  Nobody should have that right or that choice to kill a child.
[02:18:56.409 --> 02:18:57.170]  That's never right.
[02:18:57.410 --> 02:18:58.130]  And I admire you.
[02:18:58.874 --> 02:19:03.476]  When you just said that you have adopted children, there's so many good people out there that do.
[02:19:04.232 --> 02:19:06.312]  That are out there to adopt children.
[02:19:06.632 --> 02:19:11.353]  And like, for example, me and my wife, I got my wife pregnant when she was 18 years old.
[02:19:11.393 --> 02:19:12.294]  I'm 24 now.
[02:19:12.834 --> 02:19:18.375]  Um, I had a son when I was 21 and I make $35,000 a year.
[02:19:18.415 --> 02:19:19.495]  She's a stay at home mom.
[02:19:19.535 --> 02:19:20.595]  We eat all organic.
[02:19:20.975 --> 02:19:25.376]  I don't want to hear people say that they, um, you know, you can't get out of the system.
[02:19:25.396 --> 02:19:27.817]  You can't, you know, making only a certain amount of money.
[02:19:27.837 --> 02:19:29.217]  You can only do so much because
[02:19:29.873 --> 02:19:32.294]  I get by just fine, and can save plenty of money.
[02:19:32.554 --> 02:19:33.154]  That's right.
[02:19:34.235 --> 02:19:54.662]  Sometimes those challenges are what we need in life, and like I said before, many people that I know that have had children with health issues, I was just handed this paper from the Asperger's Association of New England, and they were talking about how that's simply a high-functioning form of autism, and we've had a lot of people that they believe have had Asperger's Syndrome.
[02:19:55.462 --> 02:19:57.643]  Some of them, Jane Austen, Emily Dickinson,
[02:19:58.343 --> 02:20:03.347]  Even Thomas Edison, they say, well whether or not that's true, it's still a human life.
[02:20:03.667 --> 02:20:09.250]  People still have a right to their own life and their liberty and we'll be right back taking more calls.
[02:20:09.451 --> 02:20:12.933]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.

[02:22:14.034 --> 02:22:21.261]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:22:21.401 --> 02:22:24.604]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.

[02:24:09.877 --> 02:24:15.021]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:15.701 --> 02:24:17.923]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:25.669 --> 02:24:27.029]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:27.109 --> 02:24:28.550]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex.
[02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:33.251]  And we've been talking since the bottom of the hour, last hour.
[02:24:34.091 --> 02:24:41.934]  Anthony Gucciardi came on and we were talking about this Reddit stream that he found where people said Hitler gave eugenics a bad name.
[02:24:42.594 --> 02:24:46.715]  Amazing comments, amazing things you see people say when they can get on the internet and talk.
[02:24:47.395 --> 02:24:48.015]  Anonymously.
[02:24:48.436 --> 02:24:49.937]  You find out what they really think.
[02:24:50.417 --> 02:24:53.959]  And we saw some pretty amazing, some pretty scary comments on there.
[02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:59.443]  One of them says, well, we don't think that it should be mandatory, but let's make it fashionable.
[02:24:59.903 --> 02:25:00.764]  Let's make it trendy.
[02:25:01.044 --> 02:25:02.625]  Let's encourage people.
[02:25:02.885 --> 02:25:10.990]  Let's make them feel like they're dressed poorly or they're awkward if they have too many children, let's say.
[02:25:11.591 --> 02:25:13.512]  We've got callers that were taking their opinions on it.
[02:25:13.532 --> 02:25:14.613]  We've got Tom in Maryland.
[02:25:14.653 --> 02:25:16.354]  We got him at the top of the line because
[02:25:16.974 --> 02:25:19.240]  He agrees with eugenics and we want to know why.
[02:25:19.321 --> 02:25:20.464]  He wants to explain why does.
[02:25:20.504 --> 02:25:22.449]  Tom, why do you agree with eugenics?
[02:25:23.479 --> 02:25:44.671]  Well, real quick, just to segue on your last comment, at the risk of being labeled a Nazi, I do understand from reading and from various sources that Hitler forbade the use of nuclear weapons that could affect his troops.
[02:25:44.691 --> 02:25:47.613]  I don't know if it's true or not, but
[02:25:48.308 --> 02:25:53.249]  It's certainly a contrast to what we're doing with depleted uranium.
[02:25:53.469 --> 02:25:54.069]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:25:54.089 --> 02:26:15.653]  I would say that after Operation Paperclip, we had a lot, a lot of Nazi scientists who came to the United States, and those types of operations that they have been doing in concentration camps, on POW prisoners, on concentration camp prisoners, they continue those types of experiments at Fort Detrick and other places, nuclear, biological, chemical experiments.
[02:26:16.933 --> 02:26:31.359]  Anthony was talking about the plutonium experiments that they conducted on people, so there's been a lot of experimentation here in the United States, and we need to come to grips with the idea that just because we're America, that doesn't make us the good guys.
[02:26:31.479 --> 02:26:39.982]  Our American government has done things just like the Nazis have done, in some cases worse, and we should not give our own government a pass.
[02:26:40.402 --> 02:26:42.643]  That's the kind of tribalistic thinking that
[02:26:43.303 --> 02:26:48.789]  Divorces the actual facts, the actual things that people are doing and kind of says, well, we're good guys because we're Americans.
[02:26:48.829 --> 02:26:50.150]  They're bad guys because they're Nazis.
[02:26:50.431 --> 02:27:00.381]  And it's the kind of thinking that keeps us from actually looking at the policies of Hitler and making those comparisons here in the United States and say, look, we're making these same mistakes.
[02:27:00.401 --> 02:27:01.722]  We're heading down the same path.
[02:27:02.123 --> 02:27:02.563]  But go ahead.
[02:27:02.583 --> 02:27:04.345]  Tell us about what you think about eugenics.
[02:27:05.177 --> 02:27:16.096]  That's for sure, but my point was, and maybe you can verify this through your sources, my point was that Hitler had a nuclear option and didn't use it.
[02:27:18.954 --> 02:27:26.919]  I don't know what that says about him and his regime, which obviously was out of control, but I just wanted to make that point.
[02:27:27.279 --> 02:27:40.007]  Going to the eugenics question though, what your other caller said a few calls back, if I can try to defend him a little bit, I think what he was trying to say is that we do have an actual
[02:27:41.403 --> 02:27:44.125]  Concern over overpopulation.
[02:27:44.145 --> 02:27:47.568]  Gluttony is not good in any situation.
[02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:51.551]  And we can see that in certain countries.
[02:27:52.332 --> 02:27:59.098]  And I don't think it's up to any individual man or woman to make a decision.
[02:27:59.578 --> 02:28:05.103]  We can go into certainly we can go into an area that's got a very high population density like India.
[02:28:06.161 --> 02:28:12.024]  And we can say that the problems are the number of people that they have, but are they really the number of people that they have?
[02:28:12.124 --> 02:28:17.487]  Or is it maybe something that is like the kind of economic system that they live under, the kind of government that they live under?
[02:28:17.807 --> 02:28:24.271]  Could it be that if they had a different set of values there, if they had more liberty, more freedom?
[02:28:25.091 --> 02:28:32.974]  If they had a different kind of economic structure, perhaps it's the banks, perhaps it's central banks that are creating economic desperation there.
[02:28:32.994 --> 02:28:36.196]  You know, that happened in the United States, as we just talked about with the Federal Reserve.
[02:28:36.496 --> 02:28:40.418]  They created desperate conditions here in the United States because of fiscal policy.
[02:28:40.658 --> 02:28:43.679]  It wasn't because of the number of people that we had the Great Depression.
[02:28:43.699 --> 02:28:45.800]  It was because of banking policies.
[02:28:46.100 --> 02:28:50.542]  So when we look at that, it's not necessarily, you can't make the correlation that it's because we've got too many people.
[02:28:52.052 --> 02:28:54.033]  I'm just making an observation.
[02:28:54.053 --> 02:28:58.155]  I think your views are going to meld with mine quite a bit.
[02:28:58.195 --> 02:29:11.462]  What I'm getting to is, I think it's probably a combination of what you're saying, and I do think there are situations where indeed people are having too many kids that they simply can't care for.
[02:29:11.602 --> 02:29:19.005]  However, on the flip side of the coin, we have most governments, from my observations,
[02:29:20.516 --> 02:29:21.276]  Absolutely.
[02:29:21.316 --> 02:29:28.639]  That's been the goal of governments, and like I point out, it's not only just the communists and the socialists.
[02:29:28.699 --> 02:29:31.020]  They've taken it to a fine science.
[02:29:42.145 --> 02:29:46.006]  But it goes all the way back to Plato's time, where he wanted to destroy the family.
[02:29:46.126 --> 02:29:46.426]  Why?
[02:29:46.826 --> 02:29:50.547]  Because he wanted them to be totally dependent upon the government.
[02:29:50.847 --> 02:29:53.688]  He wanted them to see the government as the source of everything.
[02:29:53.968 --> 02:29:58.709]  Be dependent upon the government, just as you pointed out, for everything, whether it's food or clothing.
[02:29:58.729 --> 02:29:59.570]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:59.610 --> 02:30:01.170]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:04.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.914 --> 02:30:13.498]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:30:13.638 --> 02:30:16.601]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:30:16.761 --> 02:30:21.985]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:30:22.326 --> 02:30:23.927]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:30:24.247 --> 02:30:25.568]  We are what we eat.
[02:30:25.888 --> 02:30:30.232]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:30:30.552 --> 02:30:34.535]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:30:34.776 --> 02:30:37.118]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:30:37.338 --> 02:30:43.262]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:31:16.127 --> 02:31:18.529]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[02:31:18.609 --> 02:31:18.909]  The U.S.
[02:31:18.969 --> 02:31:23.113]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[02:31:23.213 --> 02:31:25.795]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[02:31:26.175 --> 02:31:27.436]  They want that attack to come.
[02:31:27.656 --> 02:31:33.841]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[02:31:34.221 --> 02:31:36.682]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[02:31:36.902 --> 02:31:41.684]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[02:31:41.865 --> 02:31:49.288]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[02:31:49.608 --> 02:31:52.170]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[02:31:52.370 --> 02:31:55.012]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[02:32:08.559 --> 02:32:14.161]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:32:14.361 --> 02:32:21.583]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:32:21.743 --> 02:32:24.944]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:32:25.104 --> 02:32:26.865]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:32:27.125 --> 02:32:31.687]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:32:31.787 --> 02:32:34.528]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:32:34.688 --> 02:32:40.490]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:32:40.650 --> 02:32:44.131]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:32:44.331 --> 02:32:49.373]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[02:32:52.794 --> 02:32:58.657]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[02:33:31.700 --> 02:33:33.121]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:33:36.094 --> 02:33:50.463]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:50.503 --> 02:33:54.685]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex, and we're not going to be talking about witches at Black Magic.
[02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:56.666]  We've already talked about that at abortion clinics.
[02:33:58.567 --> 02:34:00.408]  I've got Jakari Jackson joining me here.
[02:34:00.948 --> 02:34:04.269]  We've got some breaking news here in Austin that we're going to talk about.
[02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:08.191]  I apologize to the people who have called in to talk about eugenics.
[02:34:08.231 --> 02:34:09.651]  We're going to move on to another topic now.
[02:34:09.671 --> 02:34:11.172]  We're going to flush those lines.
[02:34:11.232 --> 02:34:20.836]  But, you know, we had one of the callers who talked to us, was really kind of, I think, confusing eugenics with just kind of improving the human condition and saying there are things that we can do to help people's health.
[02:34:21.596 --> 02:34:26.318]  Things that are damaging us genetically in the environment and he was absolutely right.
[02:34:26.338 --> 02:34:36.401]  One of the things that you can do for yourself to help you from chemicals that are damaging you in the environment is Survival Shield from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:34:36.841 --> 02:34:37.942]  Actually it's InfoWarsHealth.
[02:34:38.542 --> 02:34:39.082]  You can get that.
[02:34:39.122 --> 02:34:47.086]  We just got a shipment of that, and that helps to protect you from the harmful chemicals that are so prevalent in our environment now.
[02:34:47.166 --> 02:34:49.747]  And it is one way that you can help yourself and help your family.
[02:34:49.827 --> 02:34:53.649]  It's not necessarily going to turn you into the super race or
[02:34:55.730 --> 02:34:57.971]  Some kind of a eugenics thing, but it will improve your health.
[02:34:58.071 --> 02:35:04.715]  It will make you feel much better and it will protect you against many of these harmful effects that are present every day and what you get.
[02:35:05.155 --> 02:35:08.416]  That's Survival Shield from InfoWarsHealth.com.
[02:35:10.905 --> 02:35:12.226]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:35:12.426 --> 02:35:12.646]  Yes.
[02:35:13.086 --> 02:35:14.507]  And we got Jakari Jackson.
[02:35:14.527 --> 02:35:19.589]  Now, Jakari, you got some information about something that's happening here in Austin.
[02:35:19.889 --> 02:35:25.051]  Now, it's happening in Austin, but this is something that's happening all over the country, as we just learned earlier this week.
[02:35:25.411 --> 02:35:26.352]  Tell us what's going on here.
[02:35:26.832 --> 02:35:30.253]  No, I was looking at the local news today and, you know, we have a lot of events here in Austin.
[02:35:30.293 --> 02:35:31.333]  It's a very happening city.
[02:35:31.373 --> 02:35:37.795]  We have the UT football games, we have the Formula One racetrack concerts, South by Southwest, all kinds of things.
[02:35:38.215 --> 02:35:48.618]  So they brought in the police chief from Boston to talk to Acevedo and police chief Art Acevedo here in the city of Austin to talk about terrorism preparedness and things that we could do to prepare.
[02:35:48.638 --> 02:35:51.739]  And I have this clip queued up and I want to play this clip and get your comment on it.
[02:35:51.859 --> 02:35:52.419]  Yeah, let's go.
[02:35:54.554 --> 02:35:55.475]  Go ahead and play that clip, guys.
[02:35:55.495 --> 02:36:00.198]  To put more eyes on the street, APD is also relying heavily on technology.
[02:36:00.578 --> 02:36:06.803]  They have a public safety camera system that continues to grow, helping them solve crimes within minutes.
[02:36:07.263 --> 02:36:21.674]  We know that there's a tremendous number of cameras in the private sector, and right now we're working to try to get those private cameras in public places tied into our system so we can use those non-governmental cameras.
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:28.104]  To put more odds on the street, APD is also relying heavily on full use.
[02:36:28.564 --> 02:36:35.951]  Which means that if you have, let's say you have a restaurant on 6th Street, the very happening street here in Austin, they want to be able to tap into those cameras.
[02:36:36.171 --> 02:36:44.638]  Now obviously if we had a situation like a Boston bombing or, you know, somebody mugged in the back alley, you know, hopefully the business owner would provide the information to the police.
[02:36:45.098 --> 02:36:51.524]  But to say that we want to be able to tap into your video feed anytime we choose to, that's a very unsettling thing.
[02:36:51.724 --> 02:37:02.670]  We've seen it happen over and over again where there's an incident like 9-11 or a shooting and they come in and they confiscate the recordings from the private companies and we never see them again.
[02:37:02.990 --> 02:37:06.032]  Yeah, and that's exactly what happened when you said with 9-11 with the Pentagon.
[02:37:06.773 --> 02:37:13.316]  With all the cameras around the Pentagon and they came to the various hotels and gas stations and what have you and confiscated those tapes.
[02:37:13.356 --> 02:37:19.920]  They've not seen the light of day and then they show you these few still images of the object striking the Pentagon.
[02:37:20.060 --> 02:37:31.324]  That's right, and when they've got cameras themselves spaced every few feet all the way around the perimeter of the Pentagon from every different angle, and then they never showed us any of those, they confiscated the private cameras, and so now they're doing this.
[02:37:31.364 --> 02:37:45.549]  But I think there's something else going on here too, and that is, it was just a couple of days ago, and this is linked on Drudge, how malls are preparing to keep shoppers safe this holiday season by sending their camera feeds directly to the police department.
[02:37:45.729 --> 02:37:46.890]  Oh, that's so lovely.
[02:37:47.110 --> 02:38:03.057]  Yeah, and I think people are starting to understand that, even implicitly, they're understanding that the next place we're going to see violence is the malls, because the TSA wants to continue to metastasize throughout society with these unconstitutional searches that they're doing.
[02:38:03.377 --> 02:38:04.558]  Oh, exactly, exactly.
[02:38:04.838 --> 02:38:08.300]  And you always see these movies, these futuristic video games and so forth.
[02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:11.762]  And my question is, in my mind, you know, how do they get so much surveillance?
[02:38:12.122 --> 02:38:17.506]  How do the people stand idly by and allow the police and the police state to place all these cameras everywhere?
[02:38:17.526 --> 02:38:20.507]  Because, you know, they have the traffic cams and, you know, other places.
[02:38:20.908 --> 02:38:21.168]  Yeah.
[02:38:21.308 --> 02:38:24.210]  You know, how do they get pretty much a 360 view of the city?
[02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:25.190]  And it's things like this.
[02:38:25.511 --> 02:38:26.711]  And it sounds good at the first.
[02:38:26.731 --> 02:38:32.535]  You know, you may catch a mug, you may catch, you know, a bank robber or two, but you're also giving up your privacy.
[02:38:33.015 --> 02:38:33.576]  Yeah.
[02:38:33.656 --> 02:38:46.548]  The city of Austin, which goes into a large defeat, I'm sure, can tap in and just watch you doing mundane activities, which could be mundane, it could be damning to you, if you're doing, if you're one of these thot criminals, if you have on the wrong Halloween costume.
[02:38:47.148 --> 02:38:51.713]  Well, going back to what happens when there is an incident, take the L.A.
[02:38:51.753 --> 02:38:53.915]  shooting, for example, at the airport.
[02:38:54.997 --> 02:38:58.420]  We had all kinds of conflicting stories about what the shooter looked like.
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:05.365]  First eyewitness reports that came out, and the first reports from law enforcement were that he was wearing a blue TSA uniform.
[02:39:05.526 --> 02:39:05.726]  Right.
[02:39:06.366 --> 02:39:12.371]  We heard that he was a heavyset man, and the guy who was saying this said he's much heavier than me, and that guy was fairly heavy.
[02:39:12.391 --> 02:39:17.855]  And then everything switches, and we see that no, he was actually wearing a camouflage uniform.
[02:39:18.136 --> 02:39:19.517]  No, he was actually a thin 23-year-old.
[02:39:21.358 --> 02:39:23.860]  We hear different descriptions of the gun that's being used.
[02:39:24.020 --> 02:39:24.220]  Right.
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:33.646]  Early witnesses, eyewitness reports said that he was, the first shots were made by this guy wearing a blue uniform with a pump shotgun and then he switched to a pistol.
[02:39:34.006 --> 02:39:41.811]  Then when the official story comes out, it's now an AR-15, which is a big difference to go between a shotgun to a pistol to an AR-15.
[02:39:42.292 --> 02:39:44.813]  Well that's the gun that they want to demonize all the time, right?
[02:39:44.873 --> 02:39:46.715]  It's the quote-unquote assault rifle.
[02:39:47.395 --> 02:39:54.098]  And yet, talking about these cameras, have we seen anything to back up this radical change of narrative?
[02:39:54.118 --> 02:39:57.419]  This is why people don't believe the government's official stories.
[02:39:58.239 --> 02:40:02.621]  That and the fact that the timing is so suspicious as to why they would do this.
[02:40:03.061 --> 02:40:07.104]  Yes, I also want to talk more about drills, David, because you talked about the LAX shooting.
[02:40:07.424 --> 02:40:14.590]  Let's talk for a second about the drill that was going on, because we saw the police chief come out and said, yeah, we were running this exact same drill two or three weeks ago.
[02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:17.292]  And the other two guys in the back, you know, they're doing this, they're doing this.
[02:40:17.372 --> 02:40:18.773]  I'm like, oh, man, he shouldn't have said that.
[02:40:19.293 --> 02:40:21.655]  And, you know, we see these drills happening all the time.
[02:40:21.675 --> 02:40:22.636]  We don't just see them here.
[02:40:22.696 --> 02:40:25.038]  We see them in Oklahoma City and other places.
[02:40:25.678 --> 02:40:35.765]  And as well-meaning as these police may be, I'm not saying that everybody's in on, you know, whatever may have gone on, but as well-meaning as they may be, even with these drills, they cannot protect you all the time.
[02:40:36.025 --> 02:40:42.310]  And I think that's something that people need to take away from these situations, because I just did a story last night on the nightly news about a woman who had a
[02:40:42.910 --> 02:40:43.390]  I think?
[02:41:13.410 --> 02:41:19.775]  It gives them away, and they're doing so many drills now that they're kind of covering it up that way.
[02:41:19.835 --> 02:41:27.221]  But we've seen over and over again, like you said, the exact same scenario, exact same scenario, at exactly the same time, at exactly the same place.
[02:41:27.941 --> 02:41:33.725]  And when they're doing a false flag, what that allows them to do is, if they're caught, they can say it's simply a drill.
[02:41:34.466 --> 02:41:40.610]  It also means that those first responders who are not in on what's happening think that it's part of the drill.
[02:41:40.770 --> 02:41:42.871]  So they back off and they don't respond as quickly.
[02:41:43.512 --> 02:41:44.873]  And so that's what we're concerned about.
[02:41:44.893 --> 02:41:48.976]  When we see a drill, the first thing we look at, we see a drill, we see all kinds of
[02:41:50.014 --> 02:41:52.875]  Descriptions of what's happening there that are conflicting radically.
[02:41:53.415 --> 02:41:54.976]  We see the story radically changing.
[02:41:55.036 --> 02:41:58.938]  We see no footage of what actually happened, just like in Boston.
[02:41:58.958 --> 02:42:03.840]  We never saw the footage of the brothers, except the fact that they're walking around the corner of a building with backpacks on.
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:09.102]  We never saw the footage of them actually setting bags down, as we were told by the governor.
[02:42:09.122 --> 02:42:14.544]  And then when they questioned him further on it, he said, well, I actually didn't see the footage that was described to me by the FBI.
[02:42:14.564 --> 02:42:19.146]  So even the governor had not been shown this footage, even though they've got cameras everywhere.
[02:42:19.286 --> 02:42:28.953]  Even though they're tapping in now to private cameras, we're still not allowed to see this, and we're supposed to credulously believe everything that the government tells us.
[02:42:29.153 --> 02:42:37.199]  And if they change the story 180 degrees tomorrow, we're supposed to just say, oh well, that's the new reality, and forget what they told us the very day before.
[02:42:37.679 --> 02:42:40.221]  You brought up Boston, and remember the drill.
[02:42:40.561 --> 02:42:47.846]  The University of Mobile coach, I believe it was, the track coach, said, yeah, when the thing was going on, he said, don't worry, this is just a drill.
[02:42:48.647 --> 02:42:55.252]  And then they said, I believe it was the Boston Globe reported that they were having a bomb explosion or a mock bomb explosion, something along those lines.
[02:42:55.792 --> 02:42:58.294]  At the same time, you know, it's all these drills going on.
[02:42:58.314 --> 02:43:00.455]  Dan Badani's up there asking questions.
[02:43:00.495 --> 02:43:00.975]  Are they drills?
[02:43:01.015 --> 02:43:01.916]  I say, no, they're not drills.
[02:43:01.936 --> 02:43:03.336]  Well, the Boston Globe reported it.
[02:43:03.576 --> 02:43:06.938]  We have eyewitness accounts of it, or earwitness accounts of it, people hearing it.
[02:43:07.699 --> 02:43:08.759]  But that doesn't mean anything.
[02:43:08.939 --> 02:43:12.942]  But it's still the issue that the TSA, as we know, can't protect anybody.
[02:43:13.542 --> 02:43:22.129]  Security experts have been telling us all along that everything that's going on in the airports, and you know it if you've been there, you know that there's nothing that they're doing that is effective.
[02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:27.093]  Even in LAX there, one of their own employees, one of the contractors, run around throwing ice bombs, scaring people.
[02:43:27.173 --> 02:43:28.474]  I mean, they're terrorizing themselves.
[02:43:28.674 --> 02:43:29.034]  That's right.
[02:43:29.594 --> 02:43:33.417]  But the guy who created it, the congressman from Florida, said that
[02:43:34.278 --> 02:43:44.550]  He wanted to get rid of his bastard child because their success rate was so low when they sent trial people through with bombs or with guns that they were not interjecting.
[02:43:44.590 --> 02:43:45.731]  They were not catching those things.
[02:43:45.791 --> 02:43:47.233]  And so he said it's totally ineffective.
[02:43:47.253 --> 02:43:48.735]  Everybody knows that it's not effective.
[02:43:49.315 --> 02:44:03.520]  John Corbett, who filed this lawsuit against the TSA, he pointed out in the lawsuit that what they have done with these new procedures, these invasive procedures, the naked body scanners, the invasive pat-downs that violate our Fourth Amendment protection, violate our dignity, our freedom.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.642]  So what they've done is they've created massive lines at the entrance to the airport.
[02:44:08.062 --> 02:44:11.503]  So you've got a mass of people just standing around like targets.
[02:44:11.883 --> 02:44:12.163]  Oh yeah.
[02:44:12.383 --> 02:44:21.069]  And somebody can walk up there that hasn't gone through screening and just start massively killing people because especially in California it's pretty much a gun-free zone throughout the state.
[02:44:21.250 --> 02:44:21.470]  Pretty much.
[02:44:21.490 --> 02:44:22.791]  But certainly at the airports.
[02:44:22.831 --> 02:44:29.716]  But in those airports they know that nobody's going to be armed and so they can basically kill the people that are waiting to go through these invasive procedures.
[02:44:30.136 --> 02:44:31.016]  I think it's also
[02:44:31.937 --> 02:44:39.445]  Very important to realize that John Corbett's lawsuit was published by the government on Pacer.gov.
[02:44:39.485 --> 02:44:43.649]  They published an unredacted version of his lawsuit.
[02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:51.237]  He was able, through Discovery, to look at their documents and see that they knew that there was no threat against airplanes or airports.
[02:44:51.437 --> 02:44:53.338]  And they have known this for a long time.
[02:44:53.458 --> 02:44:53.899]  Exactly.
[02:44:54.139 --> 02:44:55.240]  They've known this for a long time.
[02:44:55.260 --> 02:45:04.786]  They do not want people to realize that we're being harassed at the airports because when there's no threat against us, they didn't want that to come out.
[02:45:04.806 --> 02:45:07.147]  They desperately needed a threat.
[02:45:07.167 --> 02:45:13.932]  And we know that they're aware of this because when he came on the show, he's been on the show with, I interviewed him, Alex has interviewed him a couple of times.
[02:45:14.492 --> 02:45:16.693]  We've done articles about the lawsuit because
[02:45:17.754 --> 02:45:18.595]  It was very interesting.
[02:45:18.635 --> 02:45:22.820]  Pacer.gov is the place where all the federal lawsuits are posted.
[02:45:23.340 --> 02:45:26.704]  And the government mistakenly posted the unredacted version.
[02:45:26.744 --> 02:45:29.307]  So we can see what the TSA doesn't want us to know.
[02:45:29.367 --> 02:45:34.433]  The TSA does not want us to know that there is no threat that they're protecting us from.
[02:45:34.833 --> 02:45:36.373]  And when they did that, they took it down.
[02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:45.035]  In the first place, you know, people slide through all the time with drugs and whatever else, and it's a very arbitrary thing where sometimes, you know, you don't even go through the naked body scanner.
[02:45:45.055 --> 02:45:49.597]  They may have you go through just a pat-down or something else, and I don't like the pat-down either.
[02:45:50.197 --> 02:45:54.558]  You know, a pat-down agent isn't going to catch something that could be seen on an x-ray scanner.
[02:45:55.058 --> 02:45:56.618]  And John Corbett had produced a video.
[02:45:56.638 --> 02:45:59.239]  He's quite an activist on the TSA.
[02:45:59.279 --> 02:46:00.239]  He had produced a video.
[02:46:00.459 --> 02:46:01.980]  We've got somebody here.
[02:46:04.059 --> 02:46:06.101]  Now listen, it's torturing me seeing that newscast.
[02:46:06.682 --> 02:46:08.283]  We can do this on the nightly news or something?
[02:46:08.303 --> 02:46:08.944]  We can look it up?
[02:46:10.507 --> 02:46:11.928]  On that whole camera deal?
[02:46:12.208 --> 02:46:16.030]  That started in Homeland Security about 10 years ago in New York, D.C.
[02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.670]  and Boston.
[02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:17.491]  That's why they're here.
[02:46:17.851 --> 02:46:19.792]  That's really an NSA Homeland Security deal.
[02:46:20.152 --> 02:46:23.694]  And they're trying to make it the law that if you're a business, you've got to wire through.
[02:46:23.714 --> 02:46:26.715]  You get insurance discounts, including cameras inside.
[02:46:27.636 --> 02:46:29.717]  And I remember when they first put these cameras in 20 years ago.
[02:46:29.777 --> 02:46:31.197]  Oh, it's never for surveillance.
[02:46:31.217 --> 02:46:31.898]  It's for traffic.
[02:46:32.438 --> 02:46:35.360]  So the whole point is the government staging the terror attacks.
[02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:35.740]  Right.
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:38.421]  So, I mean, I just saw you guys talking about it.
[02:46:38.561 --> 02:46:39.622]  And, you know, for me,
[02:46:40.595 --> 02:46:53.125]  For me, that's really the big point here, is that we need to understand that Arne Seveda is definitely on the tip of the spear right into Texas with the feds to bring in these control grids.
[02:46:53.606 --> 02:46:54.867]  That you can believe
[02:46:55.837 --> 02:47:04.386]  If, just like the Boston bombing, they had thousands of cameras and they cover up all the contractors and the backpacks and the Saudis and the dead bodies and I mean they staged it.
[02:47:04.746 --> 02:47:04.927]  Right.
[02:47:05.087 --> 02:47:05.367]  Okay?
[02:47:05.707 --> 02:47:07.269]  And the Boston police covered it up.
[02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:08.250]  Our reporter was there.
[02:47:08.611 --> 02:47:11.153]  They came in the Secret Service, said shut up, don't ask questions, FBI.
[02:47:12.074 --> 02:47:14.135]  And the government did that, period.
[02:47:14.595 --> 02:47:15.996]  It's a false flag just like Gladio.
[02:47:16.036 --> 02:47:16.597]  It's on record.
[02:47:16.897 --> 02:47:17.437]  We proved it.
[02:47:17.857 --> 02:47:19.638]  And we know what they've done.
[02:47:19.718 --> 02:47:29.724]  So getting back to the TSA, we've got that contest going, $10,000 to do a video on the TSA and NSA since they're trying to go after folks saying you can't criticize them.
[02:47:30.524 --> 02:47:40.453]  We need to have folks go to the YouTube channel, it's the featured deal, and watch that and get it out to folks and have all the filmmakers do this because when they try to censor free speech, we redouble down.
[02:47:40.613 --> 02:47:41.474]  Sorry to interrupt you guys.
[02:47:41.594 --> 02:47:42.375]  That's right, January 7th.
[02:47:42.395 --> 02:47:45.598]  I don't mean to be sitting here like Igor, sitting on his shoulder.
[02:47:45.658 --> 02:47:47.639]  I gotta get in the microphone here.
[02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:50.942]  But anyways, folks, it's time to get angry and stand up to these people.
[02:47:51.102 --> 02:47:52.404]  They're trying to take over right now.
[02:47:52.884 --> 02:47:53.224]  That's right.
[02:47:53.244 --> 02:47:55.485]  One of the things that they hate is to be made fun of.
[02:47:55.785 --> 02:47:57.266]  And this is your perfect opportunity.
[02:47:57.406 --> 02:48:00.387]  And you can take satisfaction of that, plus you can also win $10,000.
[02:48:00.447 --> 02:48:02.988]  That's a great way to start off the year.
[02:48:03.188 --> 02:48:04.709]  January the 7th, I think it is?
[02:48:04.789 --> 02:48:05.369]  It's the deadline.
[02:48:05.409 --> 02:48:09.151]  You can go to InfoWars.com and get the full contest rules.
[02:48:09.191 --> 02:48:11.752]  We always stress to people, follow the contest rules.
[02:48:11.792 --> 02:48:13.292]  David, you've judged a contest.
[02:48:13.372 --> 02:48:14.353]  I've judged a contest.
[02:48:14.973 --> 02:48:17.816]  And a lot of the problems we have is people that don't follow the rules.
[02:48:17.836 --> 02:48:19.117]  So make sure you follow all the rules.
[02:48:19.438 --> 02:48:21.600]  Get it in on time, the proper length.
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:25.204]  There's rules like no profanity and so forth, so make sure you follow those guidelines.
[02:48:25.224 --> 02:48:27.706]  It's a way to really get under their skin.
[02:48:27.746 --> 02:48:28.267]  They hate that.
[02:48:28.867 --> 02:48:31.230]  They knew what was going on with the John Corbett lawsuit as well.
[02:48:31.810 --> 02:48:36.634]  As soon as we had him on, they put a gag order on him and said, you can't talk about that.
[02:48:36.834 --> 02:48:43.279]  So he could talk about the fact that he had been gagged and his First Amendment rights had been shut up, but the stuff is out there.
[02:48:43.439 --> 02:48:57.429]  It's in the public domain now, the fact that he quoted these documents from the TSA internally saying that terrorists were simply working on fundraising, recruiting, and propagandizing, and that's exactly what we see the TSA doing.
[02:48:58.030 --> 02:49:01.112]  They're recruiting, fundraising, and propagandizing us.
[02:49:01.172 --> 02:49:05.253]  The terrorists have won because their agenda is to change our way of life.
[02:49:05.273 --> 02:49:07.853]  Whoever the terrorist may be, it may not always be Al-Qaeda.
[02:49:07.893 --> 02:49:10.854]  You know, whoever the terrorist is, their goal is to change our way of life.
[02:49:11.154 --> 02:49:12.595]  And now we have to... They laugh.
[02:49:12.655 --> 02:49:22.757]  I bet they watch these reports and laugh, oh, you get felt up at the airport, you get a naked body scan, they're tapping into your private security feeds, they're tapping into your phone, they're doing all this.
[02:49:23.137 --> 02:49:23.557]  They've won.
[02:49:23.957 --> 02:49:24.257]  That's right.
[02:49:24.297 --> 02:49:27.918]  And we see the metastasizing security state, as Alex pointed out.
[02:49:28.678 --> 02:49:34.160]  Having these cameras everywhere and feeding them back to the government, to their fusion centers, so they can watch us.
[02:49:34.220 --> 02:49:36.341]  It's an absolute total surveillance state.
[02:49:36.861 --> 02:49:39.963]  It's everything in your digital life, everything in your physical life.
[02:49:39.983 --> 02:49:41.283]  They want to track your cars.
[02:49:41.343 --> 02:49:44.764]  They want to know how much you've driven, where you've driven, when you've driven.
[02:49:44.784 --> 02:49:47.225]  They want to tax you and they want to control you.
[02:49:47.426 --> 02:49:49.246]  Oh yeah, they want to control your internet searches.
[02:49:49.847 --> 02:49:50.227]  All of that.
[02:49:51.107 --> 02:49:51.267]  Yeah.
[02:49:51.427 --> 02:49:52.507]  Now, David, I have some more news.
[02:49:52.868 --> 02:49:56.369]  We're talking about these drills at LAX, and I just want to bring people's attention.
[02:49:56.389 --> 02:50:03.091]  I've gotten some emails and some things on the tip share telling us about drills that are going on this very weekend here in the state of Texas.
[02:50:03.131 --> 02:50:11.974]  Now, these are in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and from what I understand, it's multiple drills at multiple locations, so I don't know all the details on it.
[02:50:12.394 --> 02:50:15.755]  And here's one, if we can pull up that article from the Arlington Voice.
[02:50:16.135 --> 02:50:19.456]  A Mid-Opposition Council Approves Urban Shield Exercise.
[02:50:19.796 --> 02:50:28.044]  Now, Urban Shield also did an exercise, a drill in Boston before the Boston bombing and we saw how effective that was at actually stopping a terrorist event.
[02:50:28.324 --> 02:50:31.307]  They just had an Urban Shield in California towards the end of October, too.
[02:50:31.447 --> 02:50:32.027]  Yes, yes.
[02:50:32.067 --> 02:50:34.489]  So, I mean, these things are... And then we had a shooting in L.A.
[02:50:35.210 --> 02:50:36.892]  It wasn't in exactly the same area, but...
[02:50:37.352 --> 02:50:38.072]  It's kind of interesting.
[02:50:38.092 --> 02:50:38.613]  Similar things.
[02:50:38.653 --> 02:50:48.678]  Now if you look, the article says, Urban Shield is described as a full-scale exercise meant to test North Texas's ability to respond to simultaneous terrorist attacks and emergency scenarios.
[02:50:48.958 --> 02:50:51.940]  I know we're going to break so we can talk a little bit more about this on the other side.
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:53.101]  That's right, we'll be right back.
[02:50:53.181 --> 02:50:58.884]  I'm here in studio with Jakari Jackson and we're talking about the burgeoning, metastasizing police state.
[02:50:59.384 --> 02:51:03.386]  Cameras everywhere and drills constantly being conducted against you.
[02:51:03.406 --> 02:51:04.427]  We'll be right back.

[02:52:08.712 --> 02:52:09.732]  My name is Josh.
[02:52:10.132 --> 02:52:12.513]  One World Whey is the best in the market, hands down.
[02:52:12.673 --> 02:52:13.233]  I'm in the U.S.
[02:52:13.273 --> 02:52:15.313]  Navy, and I live a very active lifestyle.
[02:52:15.493 --> 02:52:18.074]  Being a vegetarian, it's hard getting all the protein I need.
[02:52:18.274 --> 02:52:21.855]  I tried their vegan protein powders, and I just wasn't feeling any change.
[02:52:22.075 --> 02:52:28.056]  The meathead supplement store whey protein kind of worked for a bit, but it left me feeling bloated, and my digestion seemed to slow down.
[02:52:28.196 --> 02:52:33.037]  By some divine stroke of luck, I heard a commercial of One World Whey on the radio, and it struck my interest.
[02:52:33.297 --> 02:52:35.458]  I have to tell you, I am so glad I got it.
[02:52:35.638 --> 02:52:38.620]  I have been taking it for a week and the results are amazing.
[02:52:38.880 --> 02:52:41.461]  I don't feel tired when I have to get up at 4.30 a.m.
[02:52:41.782 --> 02:52:43.082]  I look and feel better.
[02:52:43.483 --> 02:52:45.804]  I recover faster from my two workouts a day.
[02:52:46.224 --> 02:52:51.907]  When I don't have time to eat good food, I take it and I don't feel the urge to stuff my face for hours.
[02:52:52.127 --> 02:52:55.249]  I got up this morning and I looked the leanest I've looked since high school.
[02:52:55.449 --> 02:52:56.610]  I can go on and on.
[02:52:56.690 --> 02:52:59.351]  The best I can do to repay you is buy more and tell my friends.
[02:52:59.491 --> 02:53:01.492]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:53:08.475 --> 02:53:14.057]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:53:14.217 --> 02:53:18.339]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere.
[02:53:18.899 --> 02:53:19.119]  We're good.
[02:53:40.470 --> 02:53:43.931]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[02:53:44.131 --> 02:53:52.434]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:53:52.574 --> 02:53:58.436]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[02:53:58.536 --> 02:54:00.536]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[02:54:17.321 --> 02:54:18.842]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:18.922 --> 02:54:34.129]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex and I'm joined here in studio with Jakari Jackson and we've just been talking about the traveling road show that the government has training for economic collapse or shutting off all of the food stamps or crashing the dollar or whatever.
[02:54:34.149 --> 02:54:35.050]  It seems like
[02:54:35.550 --> 02:54:39.852]  Everything the government is doing domestically is gearing up for this impending crash.
[02:54:39.912 --> 02:54:43.213]  And now we've got Operation Urban Shield coming to Dallas, don't we?
[02:54:43.353 --> 02:54:44.454]  That's exactly right, David.
[02:54:44.514 --> 02:54:48.676]  Now, Urban Shield is going to be taking place in Dallas this weekend in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
[02:54:48.696 --> 02:54:51.517]  It's not just Dallas, but also Fort Worth and the surrounding towns.
[02:54:51.957 --> 02:54:55.179]  So there will be over 50 first responder teams.
[02:54:55.199 --> 02:54:59.420]  50 teams, not 50 individuals, but 50 teams in 14 host sites.
[02:54:59.841 --> 02:55:02.982]  Now you can go to... Training to take you out.
[02:55:03.582 --> 02:55:12.805]  Yes, if you go to North Central Texas Council of Governments, that's the North Central Texas Council of Governments, you can go and get a list of some of their activities.
[02:55:13.165 --> 02:55:15.246]  And we want our InfoWars to go out and film these.
[02:55:15.286 --> 02:55:21.868]  Don't stand in the street blocking the event or whatever, but just stand on the sidelines, get the best view you can, put it on YouTube and send it to us.
[02:55:21.908 --> 02:55:23.869]  Because people always ask, how can I get involved?
[02:55:23.909 --> 02:55:24.449]  How can I help?
[02:55:24.689 --> 02:55:27.410]  Just go film these things, send them to us, and we'll put it up on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:28.110 --> 02:55:28.470]  Absolutely.
[02:55:28.510 --> 02:55:34.273]  Now, Obama was just in Dallas defending Obamacare, and we've got this clip from it.
[02:55:34.313 --> 02:55:38.235]  Let's take a look at what he, it was just yesterday he was in Dallas, so let's take a look at what he had to say.
[02:55:38.695 --> 02:55:43.698]  If you've got health care already, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.
[02:55:43.818 --> 02:55:45.639]  If you like the plan you have, you can keep it.
[02:55:46.079 --> 02:55:47.520]  I intend to keep this promise.
[02:55:47.700 --> 02:55:51.302]  If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[02:55:51.322 --> 02:55:54.204]  If you like your plan and your doctor, you can keep them.
[02:55:54.304 --> 02:55:56.005]  You'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[02:55:56.266 --> 02:55:58.887]  If you like your plan, you keep your plan.
[02:55:58.907 --> 02:56:03.170]  If you like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.
[02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:06.372]  If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance.
[02:56:07.172 --> 02:56:07.573]  Period.
[02:56:08.153 --> 02:56:13.156]  One of the things that sometimes gets me a little flustered, although I understand it because I'm in politics,
[02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:22.396]  Is folks who are complaining about how the website's not working.
[02:56:23.497 --> 02:56:27.460]  The first month I've not been happy with it.
[02:56:27.661 --> 02:56:29.402]  You've all heard about the website woes.
[02:56:31.144 --> 02:56:41.152]  Nothing drives me more crazy than the fact that right now there's great insurance to be had out there.
[02:56:41.593 --> 02:56:42.994]  Choice and competition.
[02:56:44.151 --> 02:56:51.118]  Where people can save money for a better product, except too many folks haven't been able to get through the website.
[02:56:52.199 --> 02:57:08.095]  Now, this is like having a really good product in a store, and the cash registers don't work, and there aren't enough parking spots, and nobody can get through the door, and so we are working overtime to get this fixed.
[02:57:09.267 --> 02:57:17.931]  As you recall, David, we had John McAfee of McAfee Antivirus Software here in studio, and he said he was asked to participate in the Obamacare website.
[02:57:17.951 --> 02:57:19.892]  He said, flat out, that site is not designed to work.
[02:57:20.212 --> 02:57:21.293]  Mike Adams said the same thing.
[02:57:21.353 --> 02:57:29.237]  It's amazing to hear him defend this, because what he is doing is he's saying, you know, there's great insurance to be had out there, but we've created this massive bottleneck that you can't get to it.
[02:57:29.657 --> 02:57:33.379]  So it's still a great plan, but you just can't get to it because we've created a bottleneck.
[02:57:33.779 --> 02:57:34.979]  The government does that everywhere.
[02:57:35.039 --> 02:57:38.461]  They do it whenever there's a major disaster and FEMA comes in, they create a bottleneck.
[02:57:38.801 --> 02:57:44.465]  They keep private individuals, churches, charities from being able to deliver stuff to people who need it.
[02:57:45.045 --> 02:57:48.767]  They always create this bottleneck, and that's all this website, that's all Obamacare is.
[02:57:48.787 --> 02:57:53.330]  But you know, I mentioned at the beginning of the program, what we're getting now are the un-election returns.
[02:57:53.350 --> 02:57:59.794]  You know, it's not just the election that was Tuesday, but we're finding out that you got 900,000 people kicked out of their plans that they wanted.
[02:58:00.094 --> 02:58:00.254]  Mm-hmm.
[02:58:00.454 --> 02:58:01.415]  Plans that they chose.
[02:58:01.515 --> 02:58:02.936]  Plans that they thought were good.
[02:58:03.337 --> 02:58:09.362]  Plans that, in fact, were better because they had deductibles that were anywhere from two to five times cheaper.
[02:58:09.622 --> 02:58:14.606]  They had insurance monthly payments that were two to five times cheaper as well.
[02:58:14.806 --> 02:58:20.151]  We see another quarter of a million people unelected from their choices in Colorado.
[02:58:20.171 --> 02:58:21.512]  So it's going on everywhere.
[02:58:22.131 --> 02:58:22.731]  Oh, definitely.
[02:58:22.771 --> 02:58:24.332]  So, uh, this is what you wanted.
[02:58:24.372 --> 02:58:26.674]  If this is what you wanted with the Obamacare, now you have it.
[02:58:27.074 --> 02:58:27.314]  Great.
[02:58:27.454 --> 02:58:28.074]  Great defense.
[02:58:28.114 --> 02:58:29.515]  Yeah, it's a great product.
[02:58:29.855 --> 02:58:35.679]  You just can't get to it because of his poorly designed, untested, unfinished website.
[02:58:36.179 --> 02:58:37.040]  Well, that's it for today.
[02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:38.280]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[02:58:38.981 --> 02:58:39.521]  Join us then.
[02:58:40.441 --> 02:58:41.682]  InfoWars Nightly News Tonight.
[02:58:41.882 --> 02:58:42.262]  That's right.
[02:58:50.473 --> 02:58:53.835]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:53.875 --> 02:58:56.176]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:58.778 --> 02:59:00.419]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:59:00.659 --> 02:59:04.181]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:59:04.321 --> 02:59:08.723]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:59:08.884 --> 02:59:12.065]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of
