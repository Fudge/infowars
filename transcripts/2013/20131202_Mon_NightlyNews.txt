[00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:22.979]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:26.784]  It's Monday, December 2nd, 2013, and here are our top stories.
[00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:35.274]  Tonight, mainstream media admits Obama is the most hostile president in history towards journalists.
[00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:40.039]  Then, is DHS Googling you before you travel?
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.383]  And are you ready for Amazon's drone delivery system?
[00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:47.866]  That's next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:06.057]  Well, as we pointed out last week, in desperation, many retailers, many big box retailers, were opening on Thanksgiving and not waiting until Black Friday.
[00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:07.098]  But as Yahoo!
[00:01:07.138 --> 00:01:11.301]  reports, despite record crowds, spending has actually declined.
[00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:16.984]  They say this is a record number of shoppers, but they spent less for the first time in history.
[00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:21.627]  While the stock market is ballooning with infused cash from the Federal Reserve,
[00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:29.475]  What this is reflecting is the reality that for the middle class, for the lower income people, we actually see jobs declining.
[00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:31.197]  We see things getting much tougher.
[00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.118]  Everybody knows that.
[00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:32.919]  Retailers knew that.
[00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.901]  That's one of the reasons why they opened up on Thursday.
[00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:38.025]  People are suffering because of the employment situation.
[00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:40.548]  Companies are afraid to hire new people.
[00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:47.353]  They're even converting full-time employees to part-time employees because they're concerned about the rising cost of health care.
[00:01:47.653 --> 00:01:55.559]  Well, in a story from Paul Joseph Watson that was picked up by the Drudge Report today, the DHS is Googling travelers before they enter the U.S.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:10.907]  We see that 50-year-old Ellen Richardson, a Canadian citizen, was told by a DHS official at Toronto's Pearson Airport that she would be refused entry because, quote, I had a hospitalization in the summer of 2012 for clinical depression.
[00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:18.774]  They said you'd be required to undergo medical evaluation by DHS-approved doctors before being accepted into the United States.
[00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:23.598]  And of course, some Canadian MPs got involved in that and looked to see if this is happening elsewhere.
[00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:30.424]  They found other cases where this is happening, as well as a lawyer, Barry Swarden, who said many people have had a similar problem.
[00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:34.048]  And it appears that the Canadian police are turning their database
[00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:35.208]  We're good to go.
[00:02:58.274 --> 00:03:02.658]  It's not just that they can't manage anything, it's that they want to micromanage our lives.
[00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.263]  And they're also paranoid and intrusive in the way that they look at our medical histories.
[00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:10.706]  Take a look at what's being used against various families here.
[00:03:10.726 --> 00:03:12.948]  There's a couple of stories that illustrate this.
[00:03:12.988 --> 00:03:21.316]  We've got an Ohio Amish girl, and a chemo case is now doing well, even though the government was trying to mandate that she take chemotherapy.
[00:03:21.856 --> 00:03:34.100]  A relative says that an Ohio Amish girl who was diagnosed with leukemia is continuing her natural treatments while in hiding with her parents because of a legal case over whether she'll be forced to resume chemotherapy.
[00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:43.644]  Now, the attorney for the hospital that demanded that she be given chemotherapy said, the undisputed testimony was that without treatment she would die within six months to a year.
[00:03:44.144 --> 00:03:45.944]  She was last treated in June.
[00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:50.086]  We don't know where she is, what her condition is, or whether she's receiving treatment.
[00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:53.312]  Well, we do know where she is and we do know what her condition is.
[00:03:53.372 --> 00:03:57.582]  She's thriving with natural treatment that she had to go out of the country to get.
[00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.160]  But maybe you don't believe in natural therapy.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.562]  Maybe you believe that everyone should have chemotherapy.
[00:04:02.602 --> 00:04:07.004]  Maybe you think the doctors should be able to override the family's wishes in this.
[00:04:07.544 --> 00:04:10.326]  Well, if you accept that principle, this is where it leads.
[00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:16.910]  We now see parents receiving threatening letters regarding mandatory medical and dental exams for their children.
[00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.391]  This is from Police State USA.
[00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:23.614]  Now in this article we see two letters, one from New York and another one from a Chippewa Indian Reservation.
[00:04:23.914 --> 00:04:24.775]  Now the one from New York
[00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:30.018]  Demands that they take their kids in for a medical exam, for dental exams, and it cites a law.
[00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:32.500]  It doesn't tell them that there is a religious exemption.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.261]  Of course, the religious exemption is going to be very difficult to get.
[00:04:35.822 --> 00:04:43.327]  But the letter from the Indian reservation is much more like what you're going to expect to see when we combine government health care with government schools.
[00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:53.692]  Now what we see on the Indian reservations is an entire weaponized bureaucracy of Agenda 21 type of policies that they've been using against the Indians for about 150 years.
[00:04:54.032 --> 00:04:59.435]  Part of that, a large part of that, was separating the children from the family, from their traditions.
[00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:06.618]  And we can now see, when we look at a letter like this, we can see what happens when the government has access to all of your medical records.
[00:05:06.938 --> 00:05:08.679]  Listen to this, what they threatened the family with.
[00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:09.360]  They said,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.624]  They threatened them with involvement with child protection services.
[00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:17.188]  They said, we don't want to have to file a report of medical neglect.
[00:05:17.288 --> 00:05:19.130]  But of course, that's what they're threatening to do.
[00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:26.899]  We can see how government health care is going to be used to assert government ownership of the children and break down the family.
[00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:30.183]  This is how MSNBC put it in a public service announcement.
[00:05:30.902 --> 00:05:34.123]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children.
[00:05:34.143 --> 00:05:42.327]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:43.347]  There you go.
[00:05:43.387 --> 00:05:46.089]  The nanny state summed up in about 10 seconds.
[00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:56.113]  And the way that can happen is if you don't take your child just for a dental checkup, you can have the school charge you with medical neglect and send child protection services after you.
[00:05:56.693 --> 00:06:00.280]  Well, threatening to take your child because you don't take them to a dental visit?
[00:06:00.581 --> 00:06:05.510]  How about the government taking a child from a pregnant lady with C-section?
[00:06:07.948 --> 00:06:14.049]  Social services in the UK cut open a pregnant woman's stomach to remove her baby against her will.
[00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:23.311]  The Italian woman was visiting Britain last year to attend a work seminar when she suffered a panic attack after failing to take medication for bipolar disorder.
[00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:33.453]  Despite the woman's mother explaining her daughter's condition to police over the phone from Italy, she was taken to a psychiatric hospital and sectioned under the Mental Health Act.
[00:06:34.013 --> 00:06:43.436]  Five weeks later, while she was still being held against her will, Essex Social Services obtained a secretive court order for the birth to be enforced by a c-section.
[00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:48.658]  Social Services never consulted her family or authorities in her own country.
[00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:58.142]  This woman was forcibly sedated while the state forced a surgery on her against her will to remove her child from her womb.
[00:06:58.962 --> 00:07:07.792]  The Essex Social Services refuses to return the child, telling the court that the woman is likely to relapse and they insist the child be adopted.
[00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:15.520]  And they're not even considering adopting the child out to the mother's family or to a family in the mother's home country of Italy.
[00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:20.125]  The case has provoked a wave of anger from MPs and patient pressure groups.
[00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:29.375]  It's being condemned as extraordinary and totalitarian, with one MP describing social workers as dictators, who are unaccountable and out of control.
[00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:35.923]  Children's services in the UK operate in great secrecy and unaccountability, thanks to the Court of Protection.
[00:07:36.443 --> 00:07:43.569]  It was introduced in 2007 by the Mental Capacity Act, and it can force people to stay in care homes or hospitals.
[00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:47.972]  And judges have the power to make life or death rulings about withdrawing treatment.
[00:07:48.393 --> 00:07:52.316]  Since 2007, the court has operated in almost total secrecy.
[00:07:52.796 --> 00:08:03.184]  Earlier this year, the Daily Mail exposed the case of Wanda Maddox, who was secretly imprisoned for five months just for repeatedly trying to release her father from a care home.
[00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:08.027]  The totalitarianism of the social services is not unique to the UK.
[00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:17.151]  Here in the police state of America, parents are also being threatened with child welfare agencies if they refuse to comply with school demands.
[00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:24.895]  These two letters were sent to parents warning them they'd be reported to CPS for failing to make dental visits every six months.
[00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:31.697]  The law states that the health certificates can only be signed by medical staff who have been authorized by the state.
[00:08:32.117 --> 00:08:39.079]  So what does that mean for parents who might be anti-vaccine or who refuse to treat their children's teeth with toxic fluoride?
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.741]  The government has usurped the role of parent away from actual parents.
[00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:49.324]  Some schools won't allow lunches to be sent from home unless they're accompanied by a doctor's note.
[00:08:49.784 --> 00:09:00.271]  Well, another school fined this parent $10 because her healthy home-packed lunch didn't meet food guide requirements, which apparently include GMO and high fructose laden crackers.
[00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:07.375]  And what about this Tennessee father who was arrested for picking up his children from school on foot rather than by a vehicle?
[00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:11.778]  He was arrested based on school policy and not a law.
[00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:20.846]  We've heard about the family in California who had to fight to get their child back from Child Protective Services after they dared to go for a second opinion.
[00:09:20.866 --> 00:09:30.454]  And then, of course, this Amish family who went into hiding in order to keep their daughter from forced chemotherapy, even though tests have shown that her cancer is gone.
[00:09:31.215 --> 00:09:37.179]  What this all boils down to is just training you to understand that the state owns your children.
[00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:44.504]  And there won't be any negative consequences for you if you just transfer the authority of your children over to the government.
[00:09:45.124 --> 00:09:59.294]  And the federally mandated Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program that's rolled into Obamacare means that the state will perform home inspections at any time to ensure that you're complying with their version of health care.
[00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:02.938]  I'm Leanne McAdoo reporting for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:15.585]  Well, CNN reported on the upgrades to Obamacare's website, his half-billion dollar website, but it told us more about CNN than it did about Obamacare.
[00:10:16.285 --> 00:10:19.927]  We had first two reporters honestly give us a report yesterday.
[00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:25.657]  Tell me about what happened because we're getting another error message here and it's supposed to be running smoothly.
[00:10:25.677 --> 00:10:26.437]  We're just not seeing that.
[00:10:26.477 --> 00:10:30.620]  Yeah, so we've, you know, we've been trying to get into this site since October 1st on and off again.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.681]  I have to say it did work a lot more smoothly this morning.
[00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:42.667]  I got through, I picked my state, I put in all my information and I got through the whole process in about eight minutes and then it said my status was in progress so I went to refresh it and I got the error message.
[00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:48.830]  Okay, so a half a billion dollars spent on this website, and then another two months of bug fixes, still didn't seem to work.
[00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.612]  But today is a very different story from CNN.
[00:10:51.632 --> 00:10:52.793]  They kind of walked that back.
[00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:53.513]  Here's what they said.
[00:10:54.093 --> 00:11:04.599]  Two months and more than 400 individual repairs later, the administration announced it met their self-imposed deadline, saying the website's error rate has fallen to well under 1%.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.981]  Several concerns remain.
[00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:15.948]  First of all, when you buy a policy on healthcare.gov, that information has to be relayed to the insurance companies, and that has not gone very smoothly.
[00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:19.911]  If your original login isn't working, it's not you.
[00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:23.594]  You may indeed have to go in and basically create a whole new account.
[00:11:23.894 --> 00:11:25.395]  Did you catch that little caveat there?
[00:11:25.756 --> 00:11:31.360]  They said although the front end may be collecting your information, they're not really sure if it's passing it on correctly.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.542]  That could be a much bigger problem.
[00:11:33.602 --> 00:11:49.615]  As many medical professionals have pointed out, if they're capturing people's information, but then passing it on incorrectly, it's going to create a huge garbled mess with the insurance companies, with the hospitals, and of course, if it doesn't work, it's not you, it's the website, that half a billion dollar website.
[00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:56.199]  But Obama has now arbitrarily ignored his own laws because, of course, he's the dictator in chief.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.442]  Here's some of the changes that have been made to the Affordable Health Care Act according to WebMD.
[00:12:01.462 --> 00:12:09.787]  They're reporting that because of all the glitches that the federal government is giving consumers more time to buy coverage that will begin on January the 1st, 2014.
[00:12:10.308 --> 00:12:13.329]  People can now buy coverage as late as December the 23rd.
[00:12:13.429 --> 00:12:17.432]  Give you a whole extra week even though they took two months to fix their website.
[00:12:18.052 --> 00:12:29.671]  But that's not the real deadline now because it also says further down the same article that people can now buy coverage all the way through the last day of open enrollment on March 31st, 2014 without facing penalties.
[00:12:29.731 --> 00:12:32.415]  So I guess that's the real deadline.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:43.609]  We don't want to lose track of the fact that the Feds can't get a website functioning besides spending this kind of money, but it's really not simply about the efficiency, about the pragmatism.
[00:12:44.049 --> 00:12:49.834]  We've got to realize that the real issues here are that people can't get health care that they want.
[00:12:49.954 --> 00:12:56.420]  Their choice is being taken away, and millions of people are losing health care coverage, and they're losing their affordability.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.401]  Of course, they called it the Affordable Health Care Act.
[00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:01.082]  That's the one change they haven't made, is to make it affordable.
[00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:08.327]  When people are spending up to five times as much for their health insurance, they're not going to be going out and shopping on Black Friday.
[00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.388]  There we go, right back to where we started.
[00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:20.614]  That's one of the major things dragging this economy down, is Obamacare, and the threat of Obamacare, the economic cost of Obamacare, besides the civil liberties issues.
[00:13:21.354 --> 00:13:25.116]  But CNN did a real nice job covering for the Obama administration.
[00:13:25.657 --> 00:13:29.018]  And as a result, we see that their ratings are falling like a rock.
[00:13:29.739 --> 00:13:33.101]  MSNBC took a more careful look at the Obama administration.
[00:13:33.121 --> 00:13:35.082]  We're going to have that right after the break, so stay tuned.
[00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:04.971]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:14:05.192 --> 00:14:12.419]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:14:12.579 --> 00:14:15.782]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:17.703]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:14:17.963 --> 00:14:22.525]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:25.386]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:14:25.526 --> 00:14:31.308]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:14:31.488 --> 00:14:34.970]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:40.192]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:14:40.452 --> 00:14:43.433]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:49.494]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:14:49.614 --> 00:14:51.595]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[00:14:51.755 --> 00:14:57.156]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at Infowarslife.com.
[00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:58.657]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:14:59.497 --> 00:15:01.138]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:15:01.378 --> 00:15:04.921]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:09.424]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:15:09.564 --> 00:15:15.548]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:15:15.688 --> 00:15:26.555]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:15:26.695 --> 00:15:29.317]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gate.

[00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:10.982]  Well, while CNN does its best to propagandize for Obamacare, people are seeing that it's propaganda, and CNN's ratings are falling like a rock.
[00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:18.509]  Now, Bob Franken used to work for CNN, he now works for MSNBC, and he had this frank assessment of what's going on.
[00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:24.615]  This is the most hostile to the media that has been in United States history.
[00:16:25.195 --> 00:16:27.518]  I won't stop fighting to open up government.
[00:16:28.138 --> 00:16:34.403]  We have put in place the toughest ethics laws and toughest transparency rules of any administration in history.
[00:16:34.944 --> 00:16:35.404]  In history!
[00:16:35.644 --> 00:16:36.565]  You would go that far?
[00:16:36.725 --> 00:16:37.406]  I would go that far.
[00:16:37.426 --> 00:16:38.326]  The most hostile in history?
[00:16:38.446 --> 00:16:44.471]  The most hostile because, first of all, we have this situation where they are, in fact, shutting out the press.
[00:16:44.651 --> 00:16:50.676]  But the reason I say most hostile is because of the Justice Department moves that they've made against the press.
[00:16:51.037 --> 00:16:53.679]  Obviously, they have a contempt for the journalistic process.
[00:16:54.226 --> 00:16:56.267]  Well, I would agree with Bob Franken's assessment.
[00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:59.109]  It's pretty clear that Obama is not transparent.
[00:16:59.449 --> 00:17:00.830]  Only his lies are transparent.
[00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.253]  And as Franken pointed out, he's very hostile to the entire journalistic process.
[00:17:05.493 --> 00:17:07.975]  The way they control that is through access.
[00:17:08.755 --> 00:17:18.441]  MSNBC was discussing complaints from photojournalists that the Obama administration is not allowing media photographers to take their own shots while pushing photos from White House-approved photographers.
[00:17:18.822 --> 00:17:21.884]  Franken told his panelists, let's use the P word here.
[00:17:22.264 --> 00:17:23.465]  It's propaganda.
[00:17:24.165 --> 00:17:25.607]  Absolutely hostile.
[00:17:26.027 --> 00:17:29.331]  He points out that the Justice Department is hostile to the press.
[00:17:29.752 --> 00:17:32.675]  They have nothing but contempt for the journalistic process.
[00:17:32.955 --> 00:17:34.757]  They have nothing but contempt for journalists.
[00:17:35.058 --> 00:17:38.461]  It's a very frightening thing to see this war on journalism, to see people like
[00:17:39.062 --> 00:17:52.392]  Feinstein saying that they need to determine who are bonafide press, and of course, free speech rights will be stripped from anybody that doesn't play games with them, that doesn't say what they want to say, doesn't follow their line of propaganda.
[00:17:52.832 --> 00:17:53.673]  You lose access.
[00:17:53.793 --> 00:17:54.894]  And then it gets even worse.
[00:17:55.314 --> 00:17:57.776]  You lose the ability to speak freely.
[00:17:58.656 --> 00:18:00.318]  We'll be right back after the break.
[00:18:00.358 --> 00:18:03.360]  We've got some interesting news about Amazon.com.
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.222]  Maybe we should start calling it Amadrone.com.
[00:18:31.616 --> 00:18:32.516]  We're on the march.
[00:18:32.976 --> 00:18:34.617]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:18:35.057 --> 00:18:38.078]  And the InfoWars Army is standing strong.

[00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:41.816]  Many anthropologists and archaeologists believe that before man even discovered the power to harness and use fire, we were involved in agrarian activities.
[00:19:42.277 --> 00:19:47.041]  That is, taking the seeds of plants and then replanting them to produce more.
[00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:56.670]  The very foundation of our modern civilization and human culture is centered around the planting and cultivation of edible plants.
[00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:02.033]  Here are some of the amazing deals at InfoWarsSeedCenter at InfoWarsShop.com.

[00:20:24.629 --> 00:20:25.210]  And remember,
[00:20:26.071 --> 00:20:28.459]  The revolution against tyranny is growing.
[00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:33.501]  Welcome back.
[00:20:34.182 --> 00:20:41.165]  Now, Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon.com, recently bought the Washington Post for several times what anybody thought it was worth.
[00:20:41.845 --> 00:20:44.086]  I don't think he bought it because it's so profitable.
[00:20:44.346 --> 00:20:47.527]  I think he bought it because it's such a powerful weapon in Washington.
[00:20:47.968 --> 00:20:52.670]  And he's going to need that to clear the regulatory obstacles for what he wants to do next.
[00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.372]  He wants to set up a private delivery system using drones.
[00:20:57.852 --> 00:21:00.313]  Maybe he could call it EmmaDrone.com.
[00:21:01.153 --> 00:21:02.294]  John Bowne has more on that.
[00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:09.100]  Amazon to fill our skies with drones within five years.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.241]  What's not to love?
[00:21:10.281 --> 00:21:12.742]  You order the groceries online and we deliver them to your door.
[00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:15.883]  That's right.
[00:21:16.243 --> 00:21:27.867]  Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wants to feed America's need for instant gratification by accelerating the slippery slope of conditioning to accept drones as a way of life.
[00:21:28.911 --> 00:21:37.280]  He envisions a future where Amazon drones are whizzing by each other to get products to people in a half hour that may have taken days or weeks.
[00:21:37.681 --> 00:21:39.302]  But at what cost?
[00:21:39.763 --> 00:21:46.410]  If we can make this model work, it would be great because it extends the range of products that we can sell.
[00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:55.535]  Google has been painstakingly recording our privacy to populate their Google Maps, but the corporatocracy-run NSA needs more data.
[00:21:56.055 --> 00:22:05.280]  Who's to say that Amazon doesn't open the door for more intrusive visits from Google, recording our family members, pets, and firearms?
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:19.495]  The publication Homeland Security Today obtained a copy of the test plan for the program, which also says sensor platforms are being tested that can distinguish between an unarmed and armed personnel.
[00:22:19.515 --> 00:22:22.439]  The Washington Times reported Michael Huerta.
[00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:27.345]  The chief of the Federal Aviation Administration predicted that U.S.
[00:22:27.565 --> 00:22:34.234]  airspace could be crowded with as many as 7,500 commercial drones within the next five years.
[00:22:34.634 --> 00:22:40.602]  But Huerta warns we need to be responsive to the public concerns about privacy.
[00:22:41.022 --> 00:22:52.707]  Given the revelations provided by Edward Snowden concerning the all-out war waged on our privacy by the NSA, all we can expect is more intrusion into our private lives.
[00:22:53.747 --> 00:23:01.110]  NSA, and the intelligence community in general, is focused on getting intelligence wherever it can, by any means possible.
[00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:06.433]  It believes, on the grounds of sort of a self-certification, that they serve the national interest.
[00:23:06.953 --> 00:23:08.774]  John Bowne, Infowars.com
[00:23:12.745 --> 00:23:21.692]  Well, in what seems to be a continually recurring story, we have yet another case of somebody committing a crime, supposedly according to the cops, by filming the cops.
[00:23:22.012 --> 00:23:24.354]  They're allowed to film everything we do, and they do.
[00:23:24.734 --> 00:23:27.897]  Not only in their squad car, but with cameras everywhere.
[00:23:27.937 --> 00:23:31.279]  But if we take a picture of them, that's a crime.
[00:23:31.419 --> 00:23:33.761]  Especially if we do it in front of the cop.
[00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:35.242]  This is what happened in Canada.
[00:23:35.282 --> 00:23:38.245]  We have a video here taken by this man's 17-year-old daughter.
[00:23:38.645 --> 00:23:41.867]  He winds up getting beat up, handcuffed, and arrested.
[00:23:42.648 --> 00:23:46.894]  And his crime, of course, is just photographing the police and doing that in front of the police.
[00:23:47.354 --> 00:23:50.578]  He had momentarily parked so his daughter could run in and get something.
[00:23:50.618 --> 00:23:52.361]  It was a very short period evidently.
[00:23:53.022 --> 00:23:55.645]  And a cop came up and was giving him an $88 ticket.
[00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:57.107]  It annoyed him, I guess.
[00:23:57.147 --> 00:24:00.852]  He wanted to get information about the police because he was going to file a complaint on them.
[00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:03.013]  Now he has something to complain about.
[00:24:22.304 --> 00:24:26.769]  Police everywhere in the United States to treat us as if we were criminals, to treat us with contempt.
[00:24:26.809 --> 00:24:32.676]  It's what we saw last week when we went to the JFK assassination commemoration in Dallas.
[00:24:32.736 --> 00:24:37.921]  We see the police there with nothing but contempt for both journalists and for citizens.
[00:24:38.542 --> 00:24:41.844]  It's something that has to change unless there's any kind of accountability.
[00:24:41.864 --> 00:24:43.625]  This is going to continue to get worse and worse.
[00:24:43.665 --> 00:24:46.166]  We see it happening more and more frequently.
[00:24:46.866 --> 00:25:01.714]  So when you see your peace officers beating people over parking violations and photographing their squad car, you have to ask yourself, did the 1993 movie Demolition Man kind of predict the dystopian society that we're now living in?
[00:25:02.174 --> 00:25:03.475]  Jakari Jackson has a report.
[00:25:06.121 --> 00:25:14.025]  When we talk about the current state of our world, we often liken our existence to books like 1984, Brave New World, or films like They Live.
[00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:18.528]  But recently I was watching that old Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes film, The Demolition Man.
[00:25:18.948 --> 00:25:23.350]  And as far-fetched and sci-fi as it may have been at the time, it does ring a little true today.
[00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.792]  So let's take a moment and analyze this piece.
[00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:29.794]  Don't you hear a thought repeating in that brain of yours?
[00:25:29.814 --> 00:25:29.934]  A name?
[00:25:29.954 --> 00:25:30.534]  Edgar.
[00:25:35.908 --> 00:25:41.493]  In short, Stallone and Snipes represent the most brutal aspects of both the police and criminals, respectively.
[00:25:41.994 --> 00:25:49.781]  After an incident leaves many innocent people dead, they're both placed into a cryogenic prison and awakened decades later into a complete nanny state.
[00:25:54.158 --> 00:25:58.244]  Uh, smoking is not good for you, and it's been deemed that anything not good for you is bad.
[00:25:58.644 --> 00:25:59.466]  Hence, illegal.
[00:25:59.966 --> 00:26:02.190]  Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat.
[00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.953]  Are you sh**ing me?
[00:26:03.973 --> 00:26:08.520]  John Sparks, you are fined one credit for a violation of the verbal morality statute.
[00:26:09.235 --> 00:26:09.836]  See what I mean?
[00:26:10.336 --> 00:26:15.280]  And while I'm not an advocate of using coarse language, I'm definitely not a fan of being fined for it either.
[00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:25.629]  Especially when you consider speaking about your lunch, which very well could contain a brown bag and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, can be considered culturally insensitive if not downright racist.
[00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:34.396]  Also, the notion that anything the state deems to be bad for you is illegal, including contact sports and salty foods, but we'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:26:35.307 --> 00:26:41.956]  In this clip, we see Wesley Snipes visiting a museum to acquire a real gun, the only place he can get one in his fictional timeline.
[00:26:42.297 --> 00:26:50.548]  And that rings true today, because there are people so uptight about gun ownership, they don't even want armed police officers to be able to pick up their own children from school.
[00:26:51.249 --> 00:26:57.671]  This clip shows the rather cavalier attitude some police officers have when using the supposed non-lethal taser.
[00:26:58.152 --> 00:27:06.935]  Recently here in Texas, a high school student was brain damaged when he dropped to the floor after being shot by a sheriff's taser for an incident he wasn't even involved in.
[00:27:06.955 --> 00:27:08.975]  You got the salt over there, Bob?
[00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:12.857]  Um, salt is not good for you, hence it is illegal.
[00:27:14.952 --> 00:27:16.773]  No salt even at Taco Bell.
[00:27:17.053 --> 00:27:30.921]  Now, if that seems a little too ridiculous to you, remember New York Mayor Bloomberg, who has his campaign to protect you from salt, from soda, this socialist campaign to protect you from everything, all the time, except for this, quote, mythical knockout game.
[00:27:31.642 --> 00:27:37.906]  And we'll end with this, a man who believes in the Constitution, so of course he has to be a dirty, underground sewer dweller.
[00:27:38.686 --> 00:27:39.446]  Because I like to think.
[00:27:39.466 --> 00:27:40.627]  I like to read.
[00:27:40.747 --> 00:27:43.288]  I'm into freedom of speech and freedom of choice.
[00:27:43.548 --> 00:27:50.310]  This fits right in with the narrative that liberty-loving, God-fearing, gun-owning Americans are the bane of the new society.
[00:27:50.771 --> 00:27:56.273]  Intentional or otherwise, Demolition Man is a semi-accurate parody of what's really going on in this country.
[00:27:56.613 --> 00:27:59.194]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the Infowars Nightly News.
