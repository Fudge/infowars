[00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:09.852]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:11.433]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.973]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:17.174]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:21.255]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:42.326]  It's Monday, the 29th day of July 2013.
[00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:44.188]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:57.621]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and we're going to have open phones and be taking your phone calls and trying to go over all of the just off-the-chart bombshell news and information.
[00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:04.347]  You know, the average person has trouble imagining 85 billion dollars of taxpayer money
[00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:06.651]  Thank you
[00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:41.804]  It was $27 trillion in one form of bailout or another that mainly multinational offshore banks got from 2008 till about 2011.
[00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:43.265]  We haven't gotten numbers in two years.
[00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:46.967]  Now they just don't release those.
[00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.449]  And people have trouble getting their mind around that.
[00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:53.672]  $27 trillion, $28 trillion.
[00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:56.633]  But they can get their mind around Obama going to
[00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:10.302]  Europe, going to Ireland, going to South Africa, going to universities around the United States, and saying, hey, you shouldn't be able to have air conditioning, or a car, or live well.
[00:02:10.302 --> 00:02:11.702]  That hurts the earth.
[00:02:11.702 --> 00:02:14.003]  You need to basically pay more taxes.
[00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:18.124]  You're bad trying to live well.
[00:02:18.124 --> 00:02:23.666]  See, they say anything they want to tax is bad, so they're going to tax it, but then ignore all the real environmental problems.
[00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:26.884]  And people can really wrap their minds around that.
[00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:34.966]  They can really wrap their minds around power prices going up, and people now are learning it's because they're shutting power plants down by the hundreds every year.
[00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:45.029]  I mean, this country's having the lights turned off, like the HAL 9000 in 2001 Space Odyssey, where they're turning off the computer's databanks.
[00:02:46.403 --> 00:02:48.905]  I'm afraid, Dave, I'm afraid.
[00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:59.374]  If America was a HAL 9000, if I was a HAL 9000, I'm sitting there watching our power, our industry, our liberties, our freedoms, our health, everything butchered.
[00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:10.764]  Everything it took hundreds of years to build is being annihilated and then Obama is on another trip, 75 staffers to join President on Ritzy Island.
[00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:25.388]  Obama Vineyard Vacation, 7.6 million private resort, over 75 rooms booked for staff, and it's going to cost millions and millions of dollars, and you thought
[00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:29.540]  You thought that Bush was bad.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.842]  Vacationing two months a year.
[00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:34.444]  And Clinton, this guy's up to like three months a year.
[00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:36.065]  Because he knows he's just a front man.
[00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:41.810]  So we'll all debate Obama all day, but in a way you've got to debate him because he is the agenda.
[00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.830]  He's the reason they can do it.
[00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.937]  It's like, well he drops bombs on people and funds Al Qaeda and secretly arrests Americans and has the CIA engage in domestic propaganda because he's black.
[00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:56.721]  I'm supposed to just go, oh my gosh, his supposed daddy is from Kenya.
[00:03:56.721 --> 00:04:00.224]  We know who his real dad is.
[00:04:00.224 --> 00:04:02.886]  And I don't think the guy's even black.
[00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:03.666]  It doesn't even matter.
[00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:11.132]  The point is, is that they sit there, for all we know Obama was grown in a test tube somewhere, and just obsess over him.
[00:04:11.132 --> 00:04:13.954]  And so for that he's very successful.
[00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:16.136]  Because he'll sail off in the sunset when this is all over.
[00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:24.740]  It'll take us a few years to figure out whoever else they put in is bad news unless it's Rand Paul or Ted Cruz.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.106]  Let me tell you, if Rand Paul or Ted Cruz got in power and really started trying to do something, they'll get shot by a lone gunman who's openly working for the globalists.
[00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.171]  No, it's up to us to not go along with all this tyranny.
[00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:40.672]  Rediscover the culture of liberty and enforce it.
[00:04:40.672 --> 00:04:41.653]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:41.653 --> 00:04:49.656]  Big story that broke on Drudge Report over the weekend, dealing with the Pentagon admitting that they've been caught lying and are going to try to stop doing it.
[00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:54.058]  I'm going to break down what's really behind that straight ahead as well, and your phone calls.
[00:04:54.058 --> 00:04:56.179]  It is a huge broadcast today.
[00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:58.480]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.

[00:08:12.694 --> 00:08:16.257]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:16.257 --> 00:08:21.601]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:25.084]  Waging war on corruption.

[00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:33.391]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:08:33.391 --> 00:08:35.672]  Returning Sundays, live on the radio.
[00:08:35.672 --> 00:08:37.214]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:37.214 --> 00:08:38.294]  as well.
[00:08:38.294 --> 00:08:39.676]  All Time Central Standard.
[00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:41.916]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:41.916 --> 00:08:48.457]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, the 29th day of July, 2013.
[00:08:48.457 --> 00:09:02.100]  We're going to be here for the next three hours, Lord willing, and we're going to open the phones up on any subject you want to discuss, but hopefully it's on some of the interesting news and important news that we're going to be breaking down.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.580]  Here's some of the news on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.581]  MSNBC host says newborn infants don't count as alive.
[00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:11.767]  And I saw that this morning at like 5 a.m.
[00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:17.410]  when I woke up and I thought, well wait a minute, didn't Watson just report on that two weeks ago?
[00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.453]  Where an MSNBC host said abort babies after they're born?
[00:09:20.453 --> 00:09:23.174]  And then I went and looked and it was another one!
[00:09:23.174 --> 00:09:29.299]  The same lady that said that your kids aren't your kids, Melissa Harris Perry.
[00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:34.943]  We've got the transcript from MSNBC, the video's not surfaced yet, but it's on Breitbart too, so Mike Adams reported on it.
[00:09:34.943 --> 00:09:36.824]  We know it's real, we know she said it.
[00:09:36.824 --> 00:09:37.965]  I just, I want to find that video.
[00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:40.478]  And then guys, dig around.
[00:09:40.478 --> 00:09:45.220]  It was like two, three weeks ago where another one said that.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.020]  Another host.
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.661]  It was a guy.
[00:09:46.661 --> 00:09:49.722]  I mean, I'm telling you, this is a talking point, folks.
[00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:56.046]  They run promo ads on there saying, your kids do not belong to you, they belong to the state.
[00:09:56.046 --> 00:10:01.148]  Which I told you is in all the CPS textbooks in college.
[00:10:01.148 --> 00:10:01.809]  People didn't believe it.
[00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:05.691]  I brought in, one of my friends was going to school as a social worker.
[00:10:06.584 --> 00:10:07.484]  For old people.
[00:10:07.484 --> 00:10:12.806]  They were forced to do the regular stuff for families, because you're trained in a wide range.
[00:10:12.806 --> 00:10:18.748]  It was like, hey, this social work book says the family's archaic and bad and has to be eradicated.
[00:10:18.748 --> 00:10:22.929]  And I'd seen it at their house and talked about it.
[00:10:22.929 --> 00:10:25.590]  This was like 10 years ago.
[00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.011]  And people didn't believe it, so I brought the textbook in on air.
[00:10:30.011 --> 00:10:32.372]  And everybody went crazy on the Prison Planet Forum.
[00:10:33.436 --> 00:10:39.864]  And found like, no exaggeration, hundreds of other books and examples where they were saying it.
[00:10:39.864 --> 00:10:48.093]  The National Association of Psychiatrists, the National Association of you name it.
[00:10:48.093 --> 00:10:49.795]  This is standard
[00:10:50.922 --> 00:11:00.068]  That's why if the CPS comes to your house because your kid falls off the jungle gym and breaks their finger, and you've even got witnesses, they're just like, you despicable family.
[00:11:00.068 --> 00:11:03.089]  Because the goal is, destroy the family.
[00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:04.730]  And that's on record!
[00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.132]  Because then we can have the glorious all-state.
[00:11:08.132 --> 00:11:10.694]  North Korea has done this with half their population.
[00:11:10.694 --> 00:11:13.436]  China, only about a third, lives in dormitories like this.
[00:11:13.436 --> 00:11:16.117]  Because it always collapses when they try it.
[00:11:16.117 --> 00:11:17.198]  Mao tried it.
[00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:19.960]  It's called the Great Leap Forward Cultural Revolution.
[00:11:20.606 --> 00:11:22.187]  Those are two different groups.
[00:11:22.187 --> 00:11:25.528]  It was the Cultural Revolution, then the Great Leap Forward came after.
[00:11:25.528 --> 00:11:31.190]  The point is, they tried to collectivize basically 100% of poor people.
[00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.970]  It's called slavery.
[00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.290]  They're big slave bits.
[00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.351]  You're free!
[00:11:34.351 --> 00:11:39.132]  Men with machine guns, you work 18 hours a day and your kids are raised by us in another facility.
[00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:40.553]  How's that freedom sound?
[00:11:40.553 --> 00:11:43.574]  Yeah, it always is so much fun under commies.
[00:11:43.574 --> 00:11:47.115]  Let me tell you, I'm a real square because I'm not intellectual and into it.
[00:11:48.226 --> 00:11:58.651]  Yeah, the campaign was led by Mao Zedong and aimed to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian economy to a communist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization.
[00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:01.693]  And you can go read into it.
[00:12:01.693 --> 00:12:03.454]  The Great Leap Forward.
[00:12:03.454 --> 00:12:06.335]  The Cold War Revolution was when he came to power.
[00:12:06.335 --> 00:12:13.799]  Then, 1958 to 61, ladies and gentlemen, they estimate that more than 40 million people died just during the Great Leap Forward.
[00:12:15.874 --> 00:12:19.559]  Of 80-something mil, the Chinese government says they killed.
[00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:27.656]  Our CIA, loving group as they are, that helped put Mao in power in 1949, says he only killed 64 million or 65 million.
[00:12:27.656 --> 00:12:33.700]  And David Rockefeller wrote in the New York Times when Mao died that communism is the way and that Mao is the model.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.142]  I have a copy of that.
[00:12:36.142 --> 00:12:37.103]  The whole thing's online.
[00:12:37.103 --> 00:12:39.265]  Just type in David Rockefeller praises Mao Zedong.
[00:12:39.265 --> 00:12:40.606]  My guys will do it right now.
[00:12:40.606 --> 00:12:42.647]  If you're watching on TV, just see how easy it is.
[00:12:42.647 --> 00:12:46.270]  You can read an editorial in the New York Times about the greatest mass murder in history.
[00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:46.870]  He's a great guy.
[00:12:48.288 --> 00:12:50.130]  See, here's the problem with my show.
[00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:55.017]  I know too much, and I'm not up here bragging on some narcissistic power trip.
[00:12:55.017 --> 00:12:55.838]  Okay?
[00:12:55.838 --> 00:12:57.139]  Like, I know a lot and you don't.
[00:12:57.139 --> 00:13:01.485]  I'm freaked out going, look, this stuff is over-the-top documented.
[00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:03.287]  And I'm fighting every instinct I've got.
[00:13:04.215 --> 00:13:08.841]  To, as I've said, jerk up everything and run to the most remote area of the world I can.
[00:13:08.841 --> 00:13:11.485]  Problem is, those are all under tyrannies as well.
[00:13:11.485 --> 00:13:13.467]  And I don't have the money to go to Switzerland.
[00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:16.391]  And I don't want to leave America and watch it fall.
[00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:22.138]  But man, I tell you, every day I look at my daughters, especially, how innocent and good they are, and that's why I hate myself.
[00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:26.801]  This shows the opposite of, like, self-loving and, oh, I'm on a power trip.
[00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:28.842]  It is, oh my gosh, this is real.
[00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:34.025]  You have picked a fight with totally crazy, control-freak social engineers, and you're even having an effect.
[00:13:34.025 --> 00:13:42.089]  So now you've got the historical absolute demand and prime directive to go all the way, Jones.
[00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:43.670]  That's what I'm thinking.
[00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.451]  At the same time, I can't help my flesh.
[00:13:47.312 --> 00:13:49.073]  The spirit's willing, but my flesh is not.
[00:13:49.073 --> 00:13:51.255]  My flesh is, get out of here.
[00:13:51.255 --> 00:13:52.716]  What are you doing?
[00:13:52.716 --> 00:13:54.096]  Don't do that.
[00:13:54.096 --> 00:13:56.558]  Oh, that's really going to make them come after you.
[00:13:56.558 --> 00:13:58.099]  You're asking for it.
[00:13:58.099 --> 00:14:00.421]  You know, why do you do this?
[00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:02.282]  You ought to work with the system.
[00:14:02.282 --> 00:14:04.643]  Look how scummy the public is anyways.
[00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:05.764]  They're just as bad.
[00:14:05.764 --> 00:14:08.326]  I mean, all the arguments.
[00:14:08.326 --> 00:14:12.068]  And I'm just like, oh, I'm just telling you folks, this is not a game.
[00:14:12.068 --> 00:14:12.369]  Okay?
[00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:14.289]  This is not a game.
[00:14:14.289 --> 00:14:23.132]  And everybody in the military and the police and the government and the corporations, you better start doing whatever you can morally to really look at what you're being told to do.
[00:14:23.132 --> 00:14:25.953]  Not the cover story, but what you really do.
[00:14:25.953 --> 00:14:30.635]  And you better realize this country is being taken over by very criminal interests.
[00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:35.137]  And if they get full control, hell is going to be released.
[00:14:35.137 --> 00:14:36.017]  K bar the door.
[00:14:37.304 --> 00:14:38.124]  And you know that.
[00:14:38.124 --> 00:14:38.744]  You know history.
[00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.065]  Your gut knows that.
[00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:48.547]  All of you that work for the system and know how accurate I am, because you're living it, you're in the middle of it, you've all got chills right now for a reason.
[00:14:48.547 --> 00:14:51.627]  Because we all know we're in grave danger.
[00:14:51.627 --> 00:14:54.668]  Everyone is in grave danger.
[00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:58.729]  This is not a joke.
[00:14:58.729 --> 00:15:00.589]  I keep trying to explain this to people.
[00:15:00.589 --> 00:15:02.530]  This is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:03.615 --> 00:15:08.297]  You can't join this evil if we stand down and let that gate open!
[00:15:08.297 --> 00:15:10.218]  Hell is coming through it!
[00:15:10.218 --> 00:15:17.762]  Everything you've seen so far is just the vanguard scouts, is the preparation, is the enemy lining up.
[00:15:17.762 --> 00:15:20.423]  You think this is a new world order assault you're seeing?
[00:15:20.423 --> 00:15:29.067]  A new world order assault was Mao Zedong killing at least 12% of the Chinese population in 20 years.
[00:15:29.067 --> 00:15:31.589]  And half of it or more in just 3 or 4 years.
[00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:42.508]  And the Bible says the Antichrist will kill over a third of the planet in just a few months.
[00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:45.529]  Whether you believe in the Antichrist or not, the Antichrist believes in you.
[00:15:45.529 --> 00:16:01.895]  This whole thing you see being manifested, you can say the fantastic planet angle of it's the subconscious mind of man, the group collective, builds this murderous archetype and then evil people that tune into that frequency, that mindset.
[00:16:01.895 --> 00:16:03.216]  It's like a high school
[00:16:06.764 --> 00:16:07.145]  I think?
[00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:29.073]  Like getting ready at the tribal camp to hop around and get ready for war.
[00:16:29.073 --> 00:16:33.355]  And then the men all get hyped up and run off to die in battle.
[00:16:33.355 --> 00:16:34.756]  That's where that comes from.
[00:16:34.756 --> 00:16:40.859]  And they hyped us up to turn our guns in, and hyped us up to be slaves, and hyped us up to go attack countries that didn't attack us.
[00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:42.259]  They're programming us.
[00:16:42.259 --> 00:16:48.842]  But just like there's a pep rally, it's the big pep rally of the year.
[00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:49.503]  I forget what it was.
[00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:55.813]  They would have cheerleaders sit there and have us drink orange soda out of a baby bottle and everything?
[00:16:55.813 --> 00:16:56.554]  I don't remember.
[00:16:56.554 --> 00:16:57.534]  I don't know.
[00:16:57.534 --> 00:16:58.255]  I played football.
[00:16:58.255 --> 00:16:59.395]  I can't remember all of it.
[00:16:59.395 --> 00:17:01.097]  Homecoming!
[00:17:01.097 --> 00:17:02.818]  I think that's what it is.
[00:17:02.818 --> 00:17:04.599]  I can't remember any of this anymore.
[00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.200]  The point is, you all get hyped up for that.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.042]  It's like there's a spirit, you know, a spirit rally, a pep rally.
[00:17:09.042 --> 00:17:10.983]  Let's get the spirit up!
[00:17:10.983 --> 00:17:12.624]  Folks, evil has a spirit.
[00:17:12.624 --> 00:17:13.545]  It has a wavelength.
[00:17:13.545 --> 00:17:17.687]  It has a crazed-eyed behavior.
[00:17:17.687 --> 00:17:19.909]  And I'm telling you, that's what's behind that door.
[00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:29.147]  They've already knocked big holes in it, they've got their people over the gates, their people inside running things, and they're saying, open the drawbridge.
[00:17:29.147 --> 00:17:32.328]  Prosperity, peace, happiness, it's all coming.
[00:17:32.328 --> 00:17:45.712]  Get rid of the family, get rid of due process, let us spy on you, let us put black uniformed police everywhere, let us have checkpoints, let the state run your children, let the system control you, it's for your safety, give up your individualism.
[00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:54.096]  Historically and currently, anytime that happens, you should run!
[00:17:54.096 --> 00:17:59.541]  You should run!
[00:17:59.541 --> 00:18:01.803]  And people are not running, folks.
[00:18:01.803 --> 00:18:03.585]  They're just saying, well, what do I do about it?
[00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:06.207]  Or they're cowardly and are deciding to join with this.
[00:18:06.207 --> 00:18:09.551]  And I didn't mean to come in here with a sermon at the start of the broadcast today.
[00:18:09.551 --> 00:18:11.372]  There's a lot of news I want to get to.
[00:18:11.372 --> 00:18:11.953]  It's just that
[00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:23.923]  I'm more and more talking about what I'm internally going through because I know a lot of you are going through it as well and I realize with horror, with horror,
[00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:30.889]  That we've been very accurate, and I wish I hadn't been so accurate.
[00:18:30.889 --> 00:18:33.349]  I wish... I almost feel guilty that I've been right.
[00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:33.809]  You know what I mean?
[00:18:33.809 --> 00:18:39.331]  Like, I wish I could be delusional, and just, oh, everything's okay, and then somehow make it all right.
[00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:43.192]  It's not gonna be all right lying about this to ourselves.
[00:18:43.192 --> 00:18:50.735]  Just like the Pentagon, head spokesman for public relations and basically public psyops, the Undersecretary of Defense came out, and Mr. Little,
[00:18:51.946 --> 00:18:56.607]  And he said, I've been authorized to tell you that we need to stop lying and we've lost all credibility.
[00:18:56.607 --> 00:19:00.909]  And he basically said, we've got to stop just stonewalling.
[00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:02.709]  That tactic isn't working.
[00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:11.032]  And then they kind of discuss how it's not a lie to just deceive people, but to be the first to deceive it and don't just stonewall.
[00:19:11.032 --> 00:19:17.734]  And the people look totally depressed in there and freaked out because they realize that it is just another PSYOP.
[00:19:18.499 --> 00:19:24.902]  And this is really the announcement of the domestic military takeover of media, which they... But it's more than that.
[00:19:24.902 --> 00:19:34.146]  Because you can tell in the body language of little, you can tell in the body language of some people that get up there, some of the colonels and generals and people in PSYOPs, that they're very concerned.
[00:19:34.146 --> 00:19:38.368]  Some look like they're crying, some look depressed, some look happy.
[00:19:38.368 --> 00:19:42.490]  This is a big deal to get up there and say, yeah, we've been lying to people, we've lost all credibility.
[00:19:43.294 --> 00:19:47.315]  So that PSYOP video is the top link on Drudge.
[00:19:47.315 --> 00:19:52.997]  Pentagon vows American people should hear it from us, not a scoop on the Drudge Report.
[00:19:52.997 --> 00:19:58.399]  And the video and the text and the transcript is up there on DrudgeReport.com on the left-hand side.
[00:19:58.399 --> 00:19:59.319]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:20:00.925 --> 00:20:06.269]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:20:06.269 --> 00:20:07.910]  What are bitcoins?
[00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:14.395]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:20:14.395 --> 00:20:16.216]  No bank needed.
[00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:21.901]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:23.682]  You are in control of your money.
[00:20:24.142 --> 00:20:25.303]  And the best part?
[00:20:25.303 --> 00:20:28.947]  You can start earning and making money with bitcoins right away.
[00:20:28.947 --> 00:20:36.835]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:40.499]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[00:20:58.409 --> 00:20:59.950]  We mine your business.
[00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:03.042]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes.
[00:21:03.042 --> 00:21:05.643]  And without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[00:21:05.643 --> 00:21:11.424]  Maser Instruments detect all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[00:21:11.424 --> 00:21:12.625]  And there always are.
[00:21:12.625 --> 00:21:13.845]  Just like your smoke alarm.
[00:21:13.845 --> 00:21:16.766]  Detecting, measuring, and monitoring nuclear radiation.
[00:21:16.766 --> 00:21:17.766]  Made in America.
[00:21:17.766 --> 00:21:18.787]  Laboratory grade.
[00:21:18.787 --> 00:21:20.067]  And EMP resistant.
[00:21:20.067 --> 00:21:24.088]  If you can't reliably measure nuclear radiation, you're not fully prepared.
[00:21:24.088 --> 00:21:25.449]  But now you can be.
[00:21:25.449 --> 00:21:27.209]  At Maser Instruments dot com.
[00:21:27.209 --> 00:21:29.710]  Spelled M-A-Z-U-R Instruments dot com.
[00:21:30.526 --> 00:21:39.829]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:39.829 --> 00:21:40.629]  This capitalism?
[00:21:40.629 --> 00:21:46.791]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:50.493]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:22:35.885 --> 00:22:46.808]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:24:22.702 --> 00:24:45.485]  Alright, so this is a big deal to have scores of top White House advisors and spokespeople and the head of Homeland Security, on and on and on, from Big Sis to Jay Carney, saying Drudge is not credible, stop looking at him, stop listening to him, he's losing credibility, when it's the opposite.
[00:24:46.943 --> 00:24:50.566]  It's not that I believe Drudge has credibility.
[00:24:50.566 --> 00:24:52.408]  It isn't even about credibility.
[00:24:52.408 --> 00:25:05.699]  It's about when you go to DrudgeReport.com and link through to see a video of Obama saying, I won't raise your payroll taxes, and then show a new video of him raising the payroll taxes.
[00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:09.722]  Or if there's somebody saying, I'm going to get a free Obama phone.
[00:25:09.722 --> 00:25:13.105]  You know, I've gotten 100 free Obama phones, and he's going to do more.
[00:25:13.105 --> 00:25:15.126]  I mean, that's what one of his supporters said.
[00:25:17.968 --> 00:25:27.996]  If Wiener gets caught lying about something, they're going to show where he lied before with the New York Daily News article, and then show an article a month later where he gets caught in the Associated Press.
[00:25:27.996 --> 00:25:38.925]  That's what they hate, is that they don't want you to remember their last lie, their last spin, their last deception, and places like DrudgeReport.com do that.
[00:25:38.925 --> 00:25:42.268]  That is in essence what they don't like.
[00:25:42.268 --> 00:25:45.971]  And so now you have the Department of Defense come out and not attack Drudge,
[00:25:47.538 --> 00:25:59.063]  As the Undersecretary of State gave a speech last week, he did not attack drugs.
[00:25:59.063 --> 00:26:03.345]  He came out and said, we need to be out in front of stories and not lie.
[00:26:03.345 --> 00:26:06.487]  Go watch the video, because we're going to get caught.
[00:26:06.487 --> 00:26:10.829]  We need to come out and tell the truth on a host of issues.
[00:26:12.702 --> 00:26:16.645]  And again, they're doing this because they know they've already lost all credibility.
[00:26:16.645 --> 00:26:19.448]  They already know that they don't have the people's trust.
[00:26:19.448 --> 00:26:30.697]  And the Pentagon is saying, hey, politicians, everybody else, and this is in the speech, that just keeps stonewalling and lying to people about bullets, about armored vehicles, about drones.
[00:26:30.697 --> 00:26:32.679]  It isn't working.
[00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:34.680]  They're catching us in the lies.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.461]  We're naked.
[00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:36.602]  We're wide open.
[00:26:36.602 --> 00:26:38.844]  Toto pulled the curtain back.
[00:26:39.994 --> 00:26:41.255]  There's no point in lying.
[00:26:41.255 --> 00:26:44.936]  Joseph Goebbels gave a speech in the last year of Nazi Germany, I think in 1944.
[00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:46.497]  You can pull it up.
[00:26:46.497 --> 00:26:49.619]  I've seen the speech in a film with English subtitles.
[00:26:49.619 --> 00:26:53.861]  He said, you know, to the SS, you know, we use propaganda on our own people before.
[00:26:53.861 --> 00:26:56.522]  This isn't a, you know, filmed event.
[00:26:56.522 --> 00:26:57.443]  We need to stop doing that.
[00:26:57.443 --> 00:27:04.646]  We need to be truthful and admit we're losing the war and they're invading and they've landed and that we've got to fight totally to beat them.
[00:27:04.646 --> 00:27:06.007]  Because it demoralizes people
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.822]  To know that we're lying to them!
[00:27:08.822 --> 00:27:14.707]  The lies only work if they buy them!
[00:27:14.707 --> 00:27:16.788]  And this is what we're talking about here.
[00:27:16.788 --> 00:27:20.932]  Look, the Pentagon knows they're lying to people.
[00:27:20.932 --> 00:27:24.975]  Not just WMDs in Iraq, but about our government running Al-Qaeda.
[00:27:24.975 --> 00:27:28.639]  And they know that American interests are being sold out.
[00:27:28.639 --> 00:27:32.262]  I have had so many former top Pentagon people on, you've heard them from
[00:27:34.585 --> 00:27:38.388]  Colonel Schaefer to Dr. Pachinik, you name it.
[00:27:38.388 --> 00:27:39.750]  NSA people, you name it.
[00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.953]  They say the entire military, almost everybody, military, NSA.
[00:27:44.224 --> 00:27:51.306]  People they talk to, FBI, who aren't part of Black Ops, who are really corrupt units, are awake, freaked out, and are very upset.
[00:27:51.306 --> 00:28:09.392]  That's why there's all these threats against whistleblowers constantly, is because the corrupt inner core of this coup d'etat, this corporate illegal takeover, are trying to intimidate people through the system to follow illegal orders, and to intimidate and persecute people that tell the truth.
[00:28:09.392 --> 00:28:11.032]  And so there's a real struggle.
[00:28:11.032 --> 00:28:12.372]  Here's the big news.
[00:28:12.372 --> 00:28:13.453]  There is a struggle
[00:28:14.241 --> 00:28:20.787]  For the heart and soul of America, and will we be part of this new world order and be sucked dry to fund the new world order empire?
[00:28:20.787 --> 00:28:24.451]  Or will we start swinging the pendulum back in the right direction?
[00:28:24.451 --> 00:28:25.712]  That's the big issue!
[00:28:27.458 --> 00:28:41.504]  When you've got an official Pentagon top press briefing, not even press briefing, they're pressing, they're there with the press, pushing for their own people to start pushing a culture of honesty.
[00:28:41.504 --> 00:28:46.206]  And they say, even do it with the officers that serve above you.
[00:28:46.206 --> 00:28:49.427]  Explain to them they've got to stop lying.
[00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:51.008]  Because they realize, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:28:52.924 --> 00:28:54.845]  That it's the only hope they've got.
[00:28:54.845 --> 00:28:58.126]  They now understand the institutions are going to collapse themselves.
[00:28:58.126 --> 00:29:01.707]  The globalists plan to collapse America.
[00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:04.288]  They realize the New World Order is really a bad place to go.
[00:29:04.288 --> 00:29:06.589]  They now realize the lies they've told.
[00:29:06.589 --> 00:29:07.709]  They now realize that.
[00:29:08.331 --> 00:29:09.392]  I've really analyzed this.
[00:29:09.392 --> 00:29:12.997]  I've analyzed a lot of the other people's posture in high levels.
[00:29:12.997 --> 00:29:25.173]  The fact that the last three chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have basically resigned over not launching illegal wars against Iran and others show that there is a counter-coup going on in government.
[00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:35.894]  It took a lot of courage to let people get up there from psyops, unscripted, it's unscripted, and say, I want to stop lying, no one believes us anymore.
[00:29:35.894 --> 00:29:37.835]  I mean, that's the type of stuff in here.
[00:29:37.835 --> 00:29:40.876]  I'm going to continue to analyze how big this is.
[00:29:40.876 --> 00:29:45.078]  But this is the Pentagon saying they're going to stop lying to the public.
[00:29:45.078 --> 00:29:49.780]  The White House and the Congress Corps, they're all intensifying it.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.181]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.181 --> 00:29:52.702]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.701 --> 00:30:00.424]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.424 --> 00:30:05.147]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:30:05.147 --> 00:30:08.248]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:30:08.248 --> 00:30:13.831]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:30:13.831 --> 00:30:15.432]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:30:15.732 --> 00:30:17.393]  We are what we eat.
[00:30:17.393 --> 00:30:22.056]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:30:22.056 --> 00:30:26.279]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:28.841]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:30:28.841 --> 00:30:35.065]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:33:17.449 --> 00:33:24.172]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.172 --> 00:33:40.478]  Alright, I want to make myself calm down a little bit and try to go over our top stories, but this report up on InfoWars.com, it's already scrolled off the front page, I'm going to have it put back up there, is right up at the top of DrudgeReport.com on the left-hand side.
[00:33:41.593 --> 00:33:42.933]  And everybody needs to read it.
[00:33:42.933 --> 00:34:02.918]  And the fact that Drudge is linked to it is getting so much attention, I probably want to fine-tune it a little bit and maybe add some more of the transcript from the 35-minute press conference with the State of the DOD Public Affairs Head of Public Affairs, the Undersecretary of State, Mr. Little.
[00:34:03.806 --> 00:34:05.908]  Because it's so incredibly important.
[00:34:05.908 --> 00:34:19.760]  And by fine-tuning, you know, I would kind of just sit there with a don, my reporters record me, and then they kind of put it as a transcript in the article, and then I look at the article later and think, you know, I could have fine-tuned that.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.203]  Like, there's stuff like, I believe this shows how credible Drudge is.
[00:34:23.203 --> 00:34:25.465]  There's no debate Drudge is credible.
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:32.010]  That's why it's so popular because he shows a wide spectrum of national, international news, raw government feeds.
[00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:37.919]  He linked to the Department of Defense transcript at the Department of Defense site.
[00:34:41.152 --> 00:34:47.875]  Saturday, and I saw comments on InfoWars and on the YouTube video saying this isn't real, Drudge isn't credible.
[00:34:47.875 --> 00:34:57.640]  Those are just bots and hired people and trolls, folks, that think you're weak-minded and are trying to create a debate about whether this is even a real DOD press conference.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.022]  I mean, see, that's what the Pentagon is saying is failing.
[00:35:02.022 --> 00:35:07.905]  He says we've got to stop just lying and just saying something isn't true.
[00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:09.086]  It's going to come out anyway.
[00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:20.065]  And this is a big deal because it's only the DOD saying this because they're better experts at PSYOPs than the White House is.
[00:35:20.065 --> 00:35:23.067]  And there's also a lot better people in the military.
[00:35:23.067 --> 00:35:26.770]  I can tell you that I have contacts at a very high level.
[00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:27.790]  You hear some of them on air.
[00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:31.393]  You hear some of them are off air.
[00:35:31.393 --> 00:35:37.998]  And, I mean, they just say the entire Pentagon is completely freaked out and realizes we've been taken over.
[00:35:39.099 --> 00:36:07.802]  and is very upset about what's happened in this nation and realizes there's a plan to basically implode us and get rid of the republic entirely and they want the American people to get politically active and take the states back and and elect good constitutionalist to government that's mainly the Ted Cruz, Rand Paul type libertarians and we can fix this but every time I talk to these high-level officers former and serving they say look we're doing whatever we can inside you've got to help us
[00:36:09.369 --> 00:36:10.630]  We're in the government.
[00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.593]  We're under a spotlight here.
[00:36:13.593 --> 00:36:21.900]  So we've got to stand up and give aid and comfort to the patriots in the government.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.303]  Because the globalists are up there demonizing them.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:43.885]  The globalists get their aid and comfort from foreign offshore banks that have hijacked this nation to a great extent, and we're in death rows, struggling with this giant boa constrictor that's around us, and if we all focus collectively, we can get this thing off of us.
[00:36:43.885 --> 00:36:48.187]  But you've got to chop its head off by admitting we've been overrun.
[00:36:48.187 --> 00:36:52.248]  You've got to chop its head off by really awakening and breaking the spell.
[00:36:52.248 --> 00:36:54.689]  You've got to chop the head off the snake, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:56.363 --> 00:36:59.784]  And I don't mean, because they'll say, that's a code word for Obama.
[00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:00.845]  No, he's a puppet.
[00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:05.567]  The worst thing that could ever happen, and a propaganda victory for the globalists.
[00:37:05.567 --> 00:37:12.409]  If Obama continues to plunge, and it looks like he might get impeached, or a bunch of whistleblowers come out, and this thing's starting to snowball, governments fall.
[00:37:12.409 --> 00:37:13.390]  Corrupt governments.
[00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.230]  Coups fail.
[00:37:15.635 --> 00:37:16.996]  All the time in history.
[00:37:16.996 --> 00:37:21.841]  If that starts happening, A, we don't want it to get out of hand because something worse could come to the fore.
[00:37:21.841 --> 00:37:23.442]  We just want to go back to the Republic.
[00:37:23.442 --> 00:37:27.606]  That's why I say all these calls for revolution, how about a revolution back to America?
[00:37:27.606 --> 00:37:37.895]  Forward to the 21st century, a re-upload of 1776, where the states go, the federal government's been seized, we pull out to reconstitute the original Republic.
[00:37:38.837 --> 00:37:39.978]  That's my plan.
[00:37:39.978 --> 00:37:44.321]  Last year, Alex Jones' headline calls for Second American Revolution.
[00:37:44.321 --> 00:37:49.464]  And then I break down that in the Declaration of Independence, we can do this however we see fit.
[00:37:49.464 --> 00:37:55.088]  Abolish the forms we've become accustomed to, to create new guarantees on our life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.
[00:37:55.088 --> 00:37:56.769]  And it's our right, our duty to do that.
[00:37:56.769 --> 00:38:04.355]  Well, I believe out of all the systems created by man, and the evidence shows that the system developed by our forebearers
[00:38:05.828 --> 00:38:17.294]  Between July 4, 1776 and 1789, when the official system was codified, that that is the best system ever developed.
[00:38:17.294 --> 00:38:31.763]  And I've studied it deeply, and I've had countless constitutional law scholars on, constitutional lawyers on, to say, yes, your plan is actually what the founding fathers would do, and is actually rooted in A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
[00:38:33.063 --> 00:38:43.129]  Well, of course, I've read, no exaggeration, over a hundred books on the Founding Fathers and what happened, and listened to probably 50 or more books on tape.
[00:38:43.129 --> 00:38:56.818]  And I mean, I've gotten the big, thick, really wordy ones, those ones I've had to read that have listed the book on tape, and I drive to work or exercise so that I can actually, you know, see what was done and what happened, and then compare it to the rest of history.
[00:38:56.818 --> 00:39:00.821]  It's the plan to restore our Republic.
[00:39:02.512 --> 00:39:05.254]  And we need to follow it.
[00:39:05.254 --> 00:39:25.387]  We should probably find the transcripts Paul Watson did in the articles we wrote from last year where I called the Second American Revolution and have those reposted to InfoWars.com so that people can understand all I put in that battle plan was what Common Sense and the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence stated.
[00:39:25.387 --> 00:39:30.651]  You've got a lot of globalists, Bilderberg Group type people like Peter Thiel and others funding total anarchy
[00:39:33.092 --> 00:39:37.256]  So that these globalists can just be above the law after they've sucked everything dry.
[00:39:37.256 --> 00:39:43.141]  And I'm telling you, that'll create anarchy in the streets with the spoiled, rotten, demon public that the globalists have created.
[00:39:43.141 --> 00:39:50.146]  We've got to slowly go out of this, but recognize collectively, big government and dependencies, a nightmare, has been wrong.
[00:39:50.146 --> 00:39:51.808]  Being an empire has been wrong.
[00:39:51.808 --> 00:39:53.469]  The New World Order has been wrong.
[00:39:53.469 --> 00:39:54.910]  The EU has been wrong.
[00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:57.032]  The whole world government has already failed.
[00:39:57.032 --> 00:39:58.974]  It was designed by banks to loot countries.
[00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:15.018]  And it's a diabolical, anti-human, neo-feudalistic system designed to make us poor and is authored by absolutely wicked, out-of-control people and must be defeated.
[00:40:15.018 --> 00:40:16.338]  That's what I'm getting at here.
[00:40:16.338 --> 00:40:21.299]  So the toll-free number to join us, we're going to open the phones up and we start the next hour so you can get lined up.
[00:40:21.299 --> 00:40:22.039]  I'd love to hear from you.
[00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:23.559]  I may even go to them in the next segment.
[00:40:23.559 --> 00:40:23.719]  It's 800-259-9231.
[00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:23.759]  800-259-9231.
[00:40:30.121 --> 00:40:30.182]  800-259-9231.
[00:40:30.182 --> 00:40:36.509]  And have your point, your question ready, because we're going to go to you.
[00:40:36.509 --> 00:40:47.081]  We don't screen the calls, but if it goes right into plugging something, I'm going to let you go, because I realize that's what stalls the show, is just that we don't screen the calls, and so it just sometimes, you know, the bad calls gum up the good.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.021]  But if you just joined us, it's a big story, folks.
[00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:55.622]  Government promises to stop lying because of Drudge Report's spotlight.
[00:40:55.622 --> 00:41:02.364]  And the word drudge and Drudge Report has become synonymous with alternative, real, independent media worldwide.
[00:41:02.364 --> 00:41:04.805]  Like Google became synonymous with search engines.
[00:41:04.805 --> 00:41:05.925]  That's what's happened.
[00:41:05.925 --> 00:41:12.367]  And so you have the whole White House and all the spin doctors and the Democrats in Congress and all these people
[00:41:13.447 --> 00:41:40.875]  Saying Drudge isn't credible, Drudge is losing credibility, because Drudge is just in a rising tide of media singularity, where there's so much media now, not only is establishment media being imploded, they're falling the fastest, alternative media is becoming more diluted because there's so much, but in the midst of it, Drudge just gets bigger and bigger and bigger, like last man standing.
[00:41:42.699 --> 00:41:44.983]  Infowars is in that backdraft as well.
[00:41:44.983 --> 00:41:54.721]  We're rising as well, while pretty much the rest of the alternative media individually is stagnant or getting smaller, but the alternative media is getting bigger in the aggregate.
[00:41:55.353 --> 00:42:00.056]  There are hundreds of millions of people getting into analysis and thinking.
[00:42:00.056 --> 00:42:01.216]  You can say, oh, they're novices.
[00:42:01.216 --> 00:42:01.697]  That's good.
[00:42:01.697 --> 00:42:02.877]  Everybody will start thinking.
[00:42:02.877 --> 00:42:05.159]  And the natural great minds will come to the fore.
[00:42:05.159 --> 00:42:08.841]  And it will create true, real diversity of ideas.
[00:42:08.841 --> 00:42:14.664]  And a true market of ideas where the best will come to the top.
[00:42:14.664 --> 00:42:16.565]  And that's what's happening.
[00:42:16.565 --> 00:42:18.947]  Survival of the fittest in the media.
[00:42:18.947 --> 00:42:24.450]  So, alternative media is displacing mainstream dinosaur parrot media, prostitute media.
[00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.852]  It is imploding.
[00:42:27.852 --> 00:42:28.713]  Lost all credibility.
[00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:30.797]  The Pentagon has all the NSA metrics and data.
[00:42:30.797 --> 00:42:33.361]  They know that it's been destroyed.
[00:42:33.361 --> 00:42:37.047]  They realize that, okay, we went with evil at the top.
[00:42:37.047 --> 00:42:38.549]  Our people are demoralized.
[00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:39.671]  Our own troops know what's happening.
[00:42:39.671 --> 00:42:41.273]  They're committing suicide at record levels.
[00:42:43.021 --> 00:42:44.381]  We can see we're going to implode.
[00:42:44.381 --> 00:42:45.622]  This is unsustainable.
[00:42:45.622 --> 00:42:46.642]  These bankers don't care.
[00:42:46.642 --> 00:42:49.442]  They think that out of the global crisis, they'll get even more power.
[00:42:49.442 --> 00:42:54.883]  And they actually are like meddling arsonists to get off on burning down societies.
[00:42:54.883 --> 00:43:03.805]  And a lot of top people, CIA, FBI, NSA, Pentagon, especially the Pentagon, especially the Army and the Marine Corps.
[00:43:03.805 --> 00:43:06.466]  It was the Marine Corps stopped the coup d'etat in the 30s.
[00:43:06.466 --> 00:43:07.866]  They were going to run with Smedley Butler.
[00:43:07.866 --> 00:43:12.467]  I mean, this has happened over and over again, folks.
[00:43:14.076 --> 00:43:18.600]  Where the military is finally going, wait a minute, we don't want, this is really evil!
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:24.205]  And I'm telling you who has led the way with the true narrative for them, with the history, and it's this show.
[00:43:24.205 --> 00:43:39.640]  And I can't believe in history, I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, and praise God for this, and thank you for your prayers and support, folks, we have analyzed this in 18 years and been laughed up up front, but the whole military, and I've always targeted the military openly, because I knew how important they were, in this fight,
[00:43:40.779 --> 00:43:43.943]  They now know that I told the truth and that it all came true.
[00:43:43.943 --> 00:43:49.170]  And so they understand now and they're listening right now, ladies and gentlemen, at military bases all over the world.
[00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.833]  They're listening at the Pentagon right now.
[00:43:50.833 --> 00:43:53.636]  They try to tell them don't do it, but then that just makes everybody do it.
[00:43:53.636 --> 00:43:54.978]  They backfired under Clinton.
[00:43:54.978 --> 00:43:56.020]  Clinton did this for us.
[00:43:57.338 --> 00:43:58.819]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:43:58.819 --> 00:44:10.807]  In about 1997, memos went out to officers in the Marine Corps first, then in the Army, on sort of covering Delta Force and Special Forces, and operations they were doing to desensitize the public.
[00:44:10.807 --> 00:44:18.492]  And I interviewed police chiefs that blew the whistle, San Antonio, police chiefs in Alice, Texas, police chiefs in Kingsville, Texas, the emergency manager.
[00:44:18.492 --> 00:44:23.475]  These guys were all former Army special operations and psych warfare.
[00:44:23.475 --> 00:44:26.638]  The people that went public, the chief of police of San Antonio was Army PSYOPs.
[00:44:27.819 --> 00:44:35.986]  The head of Kingsville Emergency, Thomas Sanchez, was former PSYOPs in Vietnam and Cambodia.
[00:44:35.986 --> 00:44:41.151]  And when they got approached for desensitization, for gun confiscation, they went public.
[00:44:41.151 --> 00:44:44.254]  It was Texas again that went public.
[00:44:44.254 --> 00:44:46.036]  And they would use any outlet they could to warn people.
[00:44:46.036 --> 00:44:46.977]  I went and interviewed these men.
[00:44:50.168 --> 00:44:57.451]  Then the military started listening, and Clinton, they had a directive from one of the undersecretaries that they were not to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:44:57.451 --> 00:44:59.952]  I was nobody!
[00:44:59.952 --> 00:45:01.753]  I had no web advertising.
[00:45:01.753 --> 00:45:05.674]  I was selling, I had one or two films that were paying for me to hire a few people.
[00:45:05.674 --> 00:45:16.099]  I was just one guy in Texas, who then started getting on a few other stations via an ISDN line at my house, and the government said, don't listen to him, and so the whole Department of Defense said, who's Alex Jones?
[00:45:17.165 --> 00:45:23.753]  And then I learned I got some web advertising and we've gone back and even looked at the records because we've got some of that.
[00:45:23.753 --> 00:45:28.059]  It was military people visiting our site and buying stuff day one that funded us.
[00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:35.768]  Bill Clinton funded Infowars.com by their people, the traders that had gotten in government saying, you don't go listen to that young man in Texas.
[00:45:36.817 --> 00:45:38.197]  Because of who he's getting on the air.
[00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:39.698]  How's he getting police chiefs on?
[00:45:39.698 --> 00:45:41.858]  How's he getting emergency management heads on?
[00:45:41.858 --> 00:45:42.538]  Who we're on?
[00:45:42.538 --> 00:45:43.759]  I'm trying to tell the media.
[00:45:43.759 --> 00:45:48.780]  Phillip has told the AP they came with bags of money to buy him off as an infiltration.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.020]  Same thing they do in a third world.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.420]  He's like, what are you doing here?
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.861]  You're trying to infiltrate and take over the government of San Antonio?
[00:45:53.861 --> 00:45:56.242]  He found out that most people in the city took the money.
[00:45:56.242 --> 00:45:56.722]  $200,000 apiece.
[00:45:58.903 --> 00:46:00.484]  1997, 1998.
[00:46:00.484 --> 00:46:05.108]  AP reported on him saying it was bribery, but not the rest of the story.
[00:46:05.108 --> 00:46:07.851]  So I called him, he said, yeah, come down here.
[00:46:07.851 --> 00:46:10.693]  I'll tell you what's going on.
[00:46:10.693 --> 00:46:14.697]  Imagine, this is how you beat evil, folks, is by saying it's wrong.
[00:46:17.722 --> 00:46:21.707]  I mean, only now do I see the whole history of it and what went on and what happened.
[00:46:21.707 --> 00:46:26.373]  I mean, I was no rocket scientist when I was first on air, 21, 22, 23.
[00:46:26.373 --> 00:46:27.915]  Still no rocket scientist.
[00:46:27.915 --> 00:46:31.600]  But I knew when I was told by military sources, go to this drill, you'll want to see this.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.384]  I go and they're trying to take guns from farmers.
[00:46:34.384 --> 00:46:34.965]  I put it out.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.404]  The media responds because they know the internet didn't have viral video at that time.
[00:46:40.404 --> 00:46:41.285]  There was no YouTube.
[00:46:41.285 --> 00:46:42.066]  He's lying.
[00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:43.928]  There was no drill in Houston.
[00:46:43.928 --> 00:46:45.329]  No helicopter crashed.
[00:46:45.329 --> 00:46:46.731]  Soldier of Fortune sends reporters.
[00:46:46.731 --> 00:46:51.916]  Finds out it happened.
[00:46:51.916 --> 00:46:53.198]  Print that article you just put on screen.
[00:46:53.198 --> 00:46:54.719]  I want to see that.
[00:46:54.719 --> 00:46:56.341]  Shocking Obama Justice Department.
[00:46:58.578 --> 00:46:59.439]  I'm going to get to that after the break.
[00:46:59.439 --> 00:47:00.680]  We'll just put it on screen.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.121]  Shocking Justice Department memo.
[00:47:02.121 --> 00:47:06.864]  Assault weapons ban won't work without confiscation and gun registration.
[00:47:06.864 --> 00:47:10.266]  Who's reporting on that now?
[00:47:10.266 --> 00:47:11.207]  That's the Gateway Pundit?
[00:47:11.207 --> 00:47:14.029]  Yeah, we reported on that.
[00:47:14.029 --> 00:47:15.170]  That's what I thought in February.
[00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.051]  Yeah, yeah, there's the article.
[00:47:17.051 --> 00:47:18.452]  Yeah, InfoWars reported on that too.
[00:47:18.452 --> 00:47:19.413]  Good job, Gateway Pundit.
[00:47:21.906 --> 00:47:28.748]  But I'm just up here ruminating on air about, kind of cogitating, about where this goes.
[00:47:28.748 --> 00:47:31.549]  Because there's a real crisis of conscience.
[00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:34.910]  See, the system did not want to have a debate about this.
[00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:47.254]  They just want to say that's not happening, we're not creating a domestic secret army, we're not training to take on gun owners and veterans, we're not training to take on conservatives and libertarians, it's crazy, it's not happening, and then it all came out.
[00:47:48.817 --> 00:47:49.998]  Five years ago.
[00:47:49.998 --> 00:47:52.199]  Okay, we're not buying thousands of armored vehicles a year.
[00:47:52.199 --> 00:47:53.779]  It's 7,000 plus.
[00:47:53.779 --> 00:47:54.700]  Giant war wagons.
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.640]  It was 2,000 this year.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.761]  7,000 the last three, four years.
[00:47:57.761 --> 00:48:00.463]  Okay, we're not training to take your... It just keeps coming out.
[00:48:00.463 --> 00:48:12.328]  And so even the Pentagon walks out and says, uh, no one's believing us and we're about to engage in domestic PSYOP operations and everybody's totally depressed looking down in the audience because they know this is a PSYOP and then a PSYOP.
[00:48:12.328 --> 00:48:13.549]  Or they think it could be.
[00:48:14.813 --> 00:48:29.285]  Some have tears in their eyes because, folks, they know at the Pentagon what this means right here in my hand, out of Foreign Affairs magazine put out by the Washington Post.
[00:48:29.285 --> 00:48:29.546]  U.S.
[00:48:29.546 --> 00:48:32.768]  repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans.
[00:48:32.768 --> 00:48:33.449]  Yeah.
[00:48:33.449 --> 00:48:37.873]  And now I saw some of the fake news funded by the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:38.954]  It's on their own site.
[00:48:38.954 --> 00:48:39.814]  I saw it yesterday.
[00:48:40.735 --> 00:48:46.558]  I was watching TV and I said that's a fake newscast and I went and looked it up and I found some older versions and a newer and I gave it to the guys.
[00:48:46.558 --> 00:48:47.758]  I didn't play it yesterday.
[00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:50.159]  I will play it later in the broadcast today.
[00:48:50.159 --> 00:49:00.624]  They are now producing fake newscasts about gun owners being arrested for being terrorists and are saying owning guns is terrorist to show weak-minded people that in between local newscasts
[00:49:01.926 --> 00:49:09.353]  Produced locally but funded by Homeland Security to create the illusion that gun owning is terrorism.
[00:49:09.353 --> 00:49:18.582]  And that's why they had a room of hundreds of PSYOP officers and civilian PSYOP people going, my God, it's bad enough we lie to people overseas.
[00:49:18.582 --> 00:49:24.048]  We're going to be doing this now to Americans, but the director to roll it out is saying we're going to stop lying.
[00:49:24.878 --> 00:49:32.546]  And so you saw some of the officers really looking freaked out, because they were sophisticated enough, the colonels and generals to know, that it was pure bull, probably.
[00:49:32.546 --> 00:49:33.568]  They weren't sure.
[00:49:33.568 --> 00:49:34.869]  See, nobody's sure.
[00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:38.193]  The undersecretary's been told to go say this, in prepared remarks.
[00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:56.662]  So see, there's PSYOPs within PSYOPs within PSYOPs, but it shows the dam has broken, and they realize they've lost total credibility, so now they're going to try to recon the military, recon the PSYOP people, recon army PSYOPs, they're listening right now, and...
[00:49:58.015 --> 00:50:00.496]  People say, well none of that makes sense, but quantify it.
[00:50:00.496 --> 00:50:01.976]  It isn't quantifiable.
[00:50:01.976 --> 00:50:03.997]  It's con artistry, folks.
[00:50:03.997 --> 00:50:06.538]  So they're trying to gaslight this, basically.
[00:50:06.538 --> 00:50:10.979]  But the question is, once you're aware of the gaslighting, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:50:10.979 --> 00:50:11.019]  800-259-9231.
[00:50:17.588 --> 00:50:19.309]  But this is a big deal.
[00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:20.730]  This is a big deal.
[00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:26.392]  And at the heart of it is the fact that no one believes them anymore, even when they tell the truth.
[00:50:26.392 --> 00:50:27.813]  And they're losing more credibility.
[00:50:27.813 --> 00:50:29.974]  They're hemorrhaging out right now.
[00:50:29.974 --> 00:50:35.017]  And so my point is, when I tweeted yesterday at Real Alex Jones, I said the new order could fall.
[00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:38.092]  It's very close to falling in Europe.
[00:50:38.092 --> 00:50:40.034]  They've beaten it in places like Iceland.
[00:50:40.034 --> 00:50:41.836]  We're close to beating it here.
[00:50:41.836 --> 00:50:48.682]  They may try to stage a big event and bring in martial law, but if the people in the Pentagon know about it, that's not going to work.
[00:50:48.682 --> 00:50:59.913]  So see, this is almost a stalemate right now, and we need to work towards a victory, but that's going to take all of us speaking out now at every level of society to defend the Republic.
[00:51:01.004 --> 00:51:02.245]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:51:02.245 --> 00:51:05.427]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[00:51:05.427 --> 00:51:09.229]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.
[00:51:09.229 --> 00:51:18.635]  In July, for every $329 you spend on our highly nutritious, great-tasting food, you will receive a $190 Patriot Pack free.
[00:51:18.635 --> 00:51:23.438]  For example, purchase a six-month supply and get three Patriot Packs free.
[00:51:23.438 --> 00:51:30.122]  The Patriot Pack is a 24-day supply of eFoods Quick Fix easy-to-store food, plus stove, fuel,
[00:51:30.362 --> 00:51:31.283]  We're good to go.
[00:52:00.922 --> 00:52:04.723]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[00:52:04.723 --> 00:52:06.824]  So you may know a few things about him.
[00:52:06.824 --> 00:52:13.506]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[00:52:13.506 --> 00:52:19.108]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[00:52:19.108 --> 00:52:21.629]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.
[00:52:21.989 --> 00:52:24.132]  Just visit GoBerky.com.

[00:54:16.232 --> 00:54:20.356]  All right, I'm going to go to phone calls right when we start the next hour.
[00:54:20.356 --> 00:54:30.364]  And then I'll get into Obama's vacations and bombings all over the Middle East and what's happening to the economy and looting of bank accounts all over the world, not just in Cyprus.
[00:54:30.364 --> 00:54:31.245]  Oh, we'll take 10 percent.
[00:54:31.245 --> 00:54:32.025]  We'll take 20 percent.
[00:54:32.025 --> 00:54:37.490]  We'll take 47.5 percent now of everybody's private bank account and give it to offshore banks.
[00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:40.172]  Yeah, that's what Reuters is reporting.
[00:54:40.172 --> 00:54:41.553]  How far will tyrants take you?
[00:54:41.553 --> 00:54:43.555]  To wherever you'll put up with.
[00:54:43.555 --> 00:54:44.416]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:51.078]  Criminals and control freaks will take advantage of you until good people stand up and say no.
[00:54:51.078 --> 00:54:52.543]  But this is such a big story.
[00:54:53.895 --> 00:55:02.361]  And if I didn't have dedicated writers working five, six, seven days a week like a Don Salazar, I'm not really a great writer when it comes to sitting down.
[00:55:02.361 --> 00:55:03.923]  I mean, I can do it.
[00:55:03.923 --> 00:55:04.923]  It just takes me a lot of time.
[00:55:04.923 --> 00:55:11.568]  But I wrote this article over several hours on Saturday with a Don Salazar, and we got it out, and now it's national news.
[00:55:11.568 --> 00:55:15.531]  And the system thought it would ignore it, but it can't do that anymore.
[00:55:15.531 --> 00:55:16.412]  It's a big deal.
[00:55:16.932 --> 00:55:26.759]  When the Undersecretary of Defense, the head of Public Affairs for the Department of Defense, comes out and says, we've got to stop lying, we've lost the people.
[00:55:26.759 --> 00:55:34.726]  And everyone in the PSYOP's division, both civilian and in the military, looks completely freaked out.
[00:55:34.726 --> 00:55:36.427]  You've got to go watch this video.
[00:55:36.427 --> 00:55:39.309]  And they get up and say, I want to stop lying.
[00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:40.670]  I want to stop covering things up.
[00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:43.352]  You mean we can really tell the truth?
[00:55:43.352 --> 00:55:44.213]  It's just amazing.
[00:55:45.083 --> 00:55:54.249]  And we'll see if they start telling the truth more, but we'll see if we support them when they tell the truth.
[00:55:54.249 --> 00:55:56.310]  Or will we just sit there and say they're a traitor?
[00:56:00.236 --> 00:56:04.939]  Before I end this hour, I also wanted to tell you we need to be supported here.
[00:56:04.939 --> 00:56:13.664]  We have been supported by your prayers and people visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting the films, the books, the t-shirts, the InfoWars magazine, all of it.

[00:56:29.581 --> 00:56:32.524]  Bar none, impregnated with colloidal silver in the filters.
[00:56:32.524 --> 00:56:34.565]  It's just heads above.
[00:56:34.565 --> 00:56:36.427]  Really, it's light years above the competition.
[00:56:36.427 --> 00:56:37.588]  I'm sorry, that's why I went with them.
[00:56:37.588 --> 00:56:40.210]  Because I looked at all the specs, used it for a year.
[00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.031]  Just, it blows the competition away.
[00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:44.353]  10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:56:44.353 --> 00:56:46.254]  The lowest prices anywhere on the web on ProPure.

[00:56:48.316 --> 00:56:51.819]  We carry several others, but I believe they're the best for the price.
[00:56:51.819 --> 00:56:54.020]  Infowarsstore.com, promo code WATER to get 10% off.
[00:56:56.359 --> 00:57:00.683]  And again, we don't fund ourselves with Ritalin and Luvox ads here like the globalists do.
[00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:04.987]  We fund it by selling good products, good clean water at the lowest prices.
[00:57:04.987 --> 00:57:05.707]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:07.136 --> 00:57:09.777]  And finally, make the commitment before the month of July ends.

[00:58:14.631 --> 00:58:17.673]  And your purchase supports the transmission.
[00:58:17.673 --> 00:58:19.874]  And they have the old-fashioned Bian Tengi Tangerine.
[00:58:19.874 --> 00:58:23.597]  Almost all of it was non-GMO, organic, but it's so hard to certify it.
[00:58:24.557 --> 00:58:26.958]  That it wasn't certified with everything.
[00:58:26.958 --> 00:58:29.318]  And still the old one's available, and I like it and use it.
[00:58:29.318 --> 00:58:34.140]  The new one, I mean, nobody has hundreds of products and has this, but they've been able to do it.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.020]  Getting one thing certified is so hard.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.261]  The new Beyond Tangy Tangerine at Infowarshealth.com.
[00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:47.263]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:17.454 --> 01:00:21.517]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.201 --> 01:00:26.862]  Alright, a lot of folks do open line Fridays.
[01:00:26.862 --> 01:00:29.763]  I do open line Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Sundays.
[01:00:29.763 --> 01:00:32.483]  Whenever I'm on, sometimes we do the open phones.
[01:00:32.483 --> 01:00:42.966]  And we're going to be getting into the collapse of the big lie, the collapse of the electronic psychological Berlin Wall the establishments tried to set up around the minds of the people.
[01:00:43.666 --> 01:00:48.508]  We're going to get into very important economic news, very important police state news.
[01:00:48.508 --> 01:00:51.269]  But it's open phones and I'm going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:00:51.269 --> 01:00:54.311]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:00:54.311 --> 01:00:58.252]  And John in Texas, thanks for calling.
[01:00:58.252 --> 01:00:59.933]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:00:59.933 --> 01:01:00.954]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:00.954 --> 01:01:02.494]  Hey, buddy.
[01:01:02.494 --> 01:01:07.977]  About six months ago, I read an article about the Soviet takeover of the Baltic countries in 1940.
[01:01:09.818 --> 01:01:13.200]  And they said, they described, the people there described what they did.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.323]  They said the first thing they did there was they set up a surveillance system where they tapped into everybody's phone calls.
[01:01:18.323 --> 01:01:20.104]  All phone calls are monitored.
[01:01:20.104 --> 01:01:23.026]  They set up a neighborhood stench program.
[01:01:23.026 --> 01:01:25.808]  They said that they seized all the bank accounts.
[01:01:25.808 --> 01:01:30.931]  They said if you had $4,000 in a bank account, they took three and gave you $1,000.
[01:01:30.931 --> 01:01:33.953]  They said everybody got a job there, but it was just enough to
[01:01:39.143 --> 01:01:44.668]  That's right.
[01:01:44.668 --> 01:02:00.840]  That's what authoritarians, whether they be fascists or communists, going back to Rome, they just called it, you know, being enslaved, is you domesticate by making people dependent, you shut them down, you surveil them, and every form of tyranny that has been invented is now being deployed against us.
[01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:07.032]  The military, the police, everybody needs to know this.
[01:02:07.032 --> 01:02:14.677]  And within the Department of Defense, the reason they've allowed them to come out and announce they're going to stop lying to us is to try to get credibility with the public.
[01:02:15.967 --> 01:02:20.508]  So they can quote have psyops work with all local and alternative media.
[01:02:20.508 --> 01:02:22.569]  They realize the citizen media is there.
[01:02:22.569 --> 01:02:30.952]  They're going to try to take it down by being embedded like they've done before, but also convince their own psyop people that they're still doing a moral operation.
[01:02:30.952 --> 01:02:34.813]  And so it's very sophisticated, but it shows a collapse level
[01:02:36.061 --> 01:02:38.201]  A lot of times they try to take over like this.
[01:02:38.201 --> 01:02:44.122]  If the host society throws it off, it can be an awakening for people.
[01:02:44.122 --> 01:02:44.903]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:02:44.903 --> 01:02:47.943]  We don't have to just go marching off into the night.
[01:02:47.943 --> 01:02:50.804]  I mean, I'm sorry, Romania's never really had freedom.
[01:02:50.804 --> 01:02:54.304]  I'm sorry, Poland really did never have freedom before the Soviets took over.
[01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:55.564]  It had feudalism.
[01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:56.985]  I'm sorry, Russia never had freedom.
[01:02:56.985 --> 01:02:59.185]  It had feudalism under the czars.
[01:02:59.185 --> 01:03:01.425]  We are a little bit different.
[01:03:01.425 --> 01:03:02.626]  And we're corrupt.
[01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:03.866]  We've got a lot of big problems.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:20.445]  But I'm telling you, we're not turning our guns in, this is tyranny, and if you want 1776 to start again, globalists, stage your terror attacks, try to start your fight, try to come arrest us all, you're gonna lose, the military's gonna end up siding with us, and we're gonna come arrest you.
[01:03:20.445 --> 01:03:25.467]  And we're gonna turn all the military machinery against you, we're gonna go dig you out of your holes overseas.
[01:03:25.467 --> 01:03:28.108]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, all of you.
[01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:30.589]  You want, I mean, I'm telling, military, even if you're evil.
[01:03:31.513 --> 01:03:33.135]  This is going to destroy your future.
[01:03:33.135 --> 01:03:35.257]  They're going to take your pension funds.
[01:03:35.257 --> 01:03:37.960]  When they're done using you to destroy everybody, they're going to destroy you.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.301]  And you know that!
[01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:41.704]  You know there's no honor among thieves and evil.
[01:03:41.704 --> 01:03:43.826]  So it's time to pull back now.
[01:03:43.826 --> 01:03:46.108]  Go ahead and finish up any points you've got, sir.
[01:03:46.108 --> 01:03:53.316]  Well, one of the things that all the government officials listen in there, you need to go back and study the Soviet system because they always turn on each other.
[01:03:54.056 --> 01:03:58.521]  I mean, uh, both of the original Bolsheviks, Stalin killed them all.
[01:03:58.521 --> 01:04:01.825]  I mean, Leontrovsky and all his followers were all annihilated.
[01:04:01.825 --> 01:04:04.668]  I mean, the system they set up turns into just Easter Ones.
[01:04:04.668 --> 01:04:10.875]  And let's get this straight, they are taking the exact tyrannies, swooping them up and deploying them, and saying they're deploying it.
[01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:15.138]  Saying they've got purges ready and re-education centers ready.
[01:04:15.138 --> 01:04:19.501]  You know, even using those type of terms to why?
[01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:20.622]  Mainline it.
[01:04:20.622 --> 01:04:21.583]  Emerge it.
[01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:23.725]  Make it no big deal.
[01:04:23.725 --> 01:04:26.047]  Get people to accept it.
[01:04:26.047 --> 01:04:29.049]  When they're getting ready to try to use it is when they've got to legitimize it.
[01:04:32.219 --> 01:04:37.180]  But people need to understand that this didn't happen in Russia, it happened in all the communist countries.
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:39.200]  They all turn on each other.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:45.161]  Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge, Mao, his followers, a lot of followers in the culture of Luxembourg were annihilated.
[01:04:45.161 --> 01:04:47.482]  I mean, it's part of the system, and that's the system.
[01:04:47.482 --> 01:04:47.942]  No, that's right.
[01:04:47.942 --> 01:04:51.503]  When you let authoritarian crooks come in, they want to kill and murder.
[01:04:51.503 --> 01:04:57.244]  I mean, you're just opening the door in your little petty power trip to the end of you and your family.
[01:04:57.244 --> 01:04:58.904]  And they'll beg later, folks.

[01:08:05.572 --> 01:08:13.477]  It's the top story on InfoWars.com and one of the top stories on DrugsReport.com and
[01:08:36.764 --> 01:08:41.988]  I've been talking about it a lot in the last hour, because it's incredibly important.
[01:08:41.988 --> 01:08:48.252]  Last week, to no mainstream media coverage, last Thursday, the head of DOD Public Affairs and PSYOPs...
[01:08:49.477 --> 01:08:53.699]  Undersecretary Little came out and said, we've got to stop lying to the public.
[01:08:53.699 --> 01:08:55.380]  We've lost credibility.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:03.805]  We're now going to help stop the lies by going and working with all the local blogs that have the credibility, because the mainstream media doesn't have the credibility.
[01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:07.587]  And the first one we want to work with, basically, is the Drudge Report.
[01:09:07.587 --> 01:09:09.548]  We want to help you.
[01:09:09.548 --> 01:09:13.370]  Yeah, they're like, we don't want people to get their news from Drudge after we've been caught lying.
[01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:14.371]  We want them to get it from us.
[01:09:15.307 --> 01:09:17.368]  So we're going to quit lying to have credibility.
[01:09:17.368 --> 01:09:21.950]  The reason they've gotten to this point is that all the numbers show it.
[01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.351]  Mainstream media has no credibility.
[01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:25.972]  Congress has a 10% approval rating.
[01:09:25.972 --> 01:09:36.536]  Obama's losing five points a week, even with his constituents that bought into him like it was buying into Madonna or Michael Jackson, a celebrity.
[01:09:36.536 --> 01:09:38.917]  People are really getting it.
[01:09:38.917 --> 01:09:42.239]  And they're learning that in most areas of the country, we've been in a depression since 2008.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.542]  And things aren't getting better, they're getting worse.
[01:09:46.542 --> 01:09:53.388]  And they're shutting our power plants down and moving our jobs overseas, paying to move them, not just letting them go.
[01:09:53.388 --> 01:10:04.857]  And so there is the Big Root Awakening, and this is the time when governments in freefall, and the corrupt industry in freefall, for them to stage a false flag terror attack, or let terrorists attack us, to try to take our liberties.
[01:10:04.857 --> 01:10:12.264]  They've put in, and are trying to normalize now, Obama is going to give you text messages about politics over your phone.
[01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:15.288]  Everyone I know, including myself.
[01:10:15.288 --> 01:10:20.513]  In fact, I'm living in such a twilight zone that a few weeks ago I woke up at like 6 a.m.
[01:10:20.513 --> 01:10:26.179]  with a bzzz and then bzzz later when I didn't check the text message.
[01:10:26.179 --> 01:10:31.204]  I have it on my phone, a text message from my provider from the White House.
[01:10:32.535 --> 01:10:37.222]  And it was, you know, telling me about things Obama was doing for the economy.
[01:10:37.222 --> 01:10:48.958]  And now, remember I tell you about the plans they have, the government send you text messages a decade ago because they were talking about it then, and break in over radio and TV, and take over all the media systems, and force all the internet browsers to a government message.
[01:10:49.858 --> 01:10:51.319]  You're like, that's crazy, that won't happen.
[01:10:51.319 --> 01:10:53.340]  I'm like, no, here's the documents.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:56.062]  Now it's, oh yeah, when there's a flu, we're going to tell you.
[01:10:56.062 --> 01:10:59.023]  Or when the president's got an initiative, he's going to text you.
[01:10:59.023 --> 01:11:00.604]  And now they're going, and you know what?
[01:11:00.604 --> 01:11:06.328]  We're going to break in and turn your phone on and make you get the messages.
[01:11:08.857 --> 01:11:18.823]  We're going to break in with video messages, and oh, it won't just be Obama, it'll be the head of Homeland Security, Big Sis.
[01:11:18.823 --> 01:11:24.226]  And they put him in, they said 860-something Walmarts got the federal money.
[01:11:24.226 --> 01:11:28.348]  But last time I checked, it was only a handful put him in, because it was still too freaky.
[01:11:28.348 --> 01:11:34.772]  Texas, Minnesota, California, we've gotten videos that our reporters have shot, and a listener
[01:11:36.778 --> 01:11:41.003]  Also sent us footage of Minnesota at a Super Walmart of the Big Sis.
[01:11:41.003 --> 01:11:47.170]  We've shown it on the news saying, Hi, Big Sis with John Napolitano here.
[01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:48.412]  If you see something, say something.
[01:11:48.412 --> 01:11:50.374]  If you see something, say something.
[01:11:50.374 --> 01:11:55.741]  Yeah, I see a tyrannical government mirroring what the Soviets did, but high-tech taking over, yeah.
[01:11:57.574 --> 01:12:04.256]  I mean, this is the type of just cuckoo crazy stuff.
[01:12:04.256 --> 01:12:11.639]  There's another longer video of it, I think it was the VST Silver Bull, you know that reporter?
[01:12:11.639 --> 01:12:16.060]  He got it at the checkout counters, actually has all the audio.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:23.282]  With her, I mean, imagine you're checking out and there's big TVs going, watch each other, don't trust anybody but me, okay?
[01:12:23.282 --> 01:12:25.143]  This is absolute tyranny.
[01:12:26.038 --> 01:12:28.161]  I'm going to go to your phone calls and get back into it.
[01:12:28.161 --> 01:12:34.349]  And then just look at Obama on all of his big lavish vacations while he says you shouldn't be able to have air conditioning or a car.
[01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:36.331]  They want to make you poor to control you.
[01:12:36.331 --> 01:12:43.620]  And the last caller, John out of Texas, talked about knowing people that had been through and knowing people who'd been...
[01:12:44.967 --> 01:12:47.748]  And the government who had also witnessed.
[01:12:47.748 --> 01:12:50.650]  Soviet psyops when they took over Eastern Bloc countries.
[01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:53.351]  First they set up a spy grid, then a citizen spy grid.
[01:12:53.351 --> 01:12:55.652]  Then they demonized the independent press.
[01:12:55.652 --> 01:12:57.453]  They demonized the family.
[01:12:57.453 --> 01:12:59.193]  I mean, they just go down the list, folks.
[01:12:59.193 --> 01:13:09.638]  When you turn on MSNBC, it's something... 60 years ago you'd get in a Mao re-education camp, but it would be on film reels.
[01:13:09.638 --> 01:13:11.919]  You know, Red Dawn tries to illustrate a re-education camp.
[01:13:14.158 --> 01:13:32.387]  They got him at the sports stadium with newsreels 24-7, getting people to turn on each other, breaking down the society, finding out who will work with them, and now the new Army Field Manual, just type in Army Field Manual, re-education camp, 2010 says re-education camp.
[01:13:32.387 --> 01:13:36.889]  That they're going to take political dissidents, people that don't agree with the new federal family,
[01:13:37.901 --> 01:13:40.402]  Are going to be taken to be re-educated.
[01:13:40.402 --> 01:13:42.362]  And that is a Soviet term.
[01:13:42.362 --> 01:13:49.644]  They didn't say taken to be prepared to be re-entered into society or sensitivity training, which is a Soviet term too.
[01:13:49.644 --> 01:13:55.885]  No, it's they use the Soviet term so the military just gets used to it.
[01:13:55.885 --> 01:13:59.526]  And then it comes out they're training contractors to kill peaceful protesters.
[01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:03.134]  And it comes out, of course they're doing this, folks.
[01:14:03.134 --> 01:14:08.561]  This is an attempt to get the military and police to carry out criminal actions.
[01:14:08.561 --> 01:14:10.003]  And I don't want a shooting war, folks.
[01:14:10.003 --> 01:14:11.825]  If they start shooting peaceful protesters...
[01:14:12.768 --> 01:14:19.450]  Gloves are off, folks, and the military and police better join the people at that point.
[01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:20.871]  Not if they know what's good for them.
[01:14:20.871 --> 01:14:21.991]  You're gonna lose.
[01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:23.212]  I've looked at all the angles.
[01:14:23.212 --> 01:14:24.552]  You will lose.
[01:14:24.552 --> 01:14:28.493]  But you'll lose by joining the pure evil.
[01:14:28.493 --> 01:14:36.896]  I mean, this is not like it's even debatable at this point.
[01:14:36.896 --> 01:14:37.597]  I know I'm ranting.
[01:14:37.597 --> 01:14:38.357]  I said I'd go to calls.
[01:14:38.357 --> 01:14:40.177]  Let's do it right now.
[01:14:40.177 --> 01:14:41.358]  It's just such a big deal.
[01:14:43.001 --> 01:14:52.745]  That we're now at the point where they're announcing, yes, the Army's going to be engaged in domestic PSYOPs at point-blank range against the American people.
[01:14:52.745 --> 01:14:57.987]  But don't worry, we come in peace, we're going to tell you the truth.
[01:14:57.987 --> 01:15:01.248]  And all those PSYOPs people in uniform just look completely freaked out.
[01:15:01.248 --> 01:15:06.310]  A, they're going to engage in stuff that's been illegal until last week, because Obama says it's okay now.
[01:15:07.476 --> 01:15:12.320]  They know it's already been going on covertly, so they're like, what does this even do to announce it?
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:15.262]  And now we're not going to lie anymore?
[01:15:15.262 --> 01:15:22.448]  They all know about trillions missing from the Pentagon, sex slavery being run by the contractors, the drugs being flown in on the C-130s.
[01:15:22.448 --> 01:15:24.650]  None of those people are stupid.
[01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:28.392]  And they're all there just going, wow, we really work for the dark side.
[01:15:28.392 --> 01:15:30.174]  America's really been taken over.
[01:15:30.174 --> 01:15:31.115]  And the people now know it.
[01:15:33.066 --> 01:15:41.570]  But the PSYOPs run by Hollywood have demoralized the general public to the point of they know, but are still so degenerate that most of them won't resist.
[01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:45.812]  I mean, it is a mess, folks, but at least we know what we're going into.
[01:15:45.812 --> 01:15:49.593]  We're not going to be caught flat-footed in any of this.
[01:15:49.593 --> 01:15:57.757]  But the fact that InfoWars.com, the things we talk about, are now mainstream news.
[01:16:00.367 --> 01:16:06.149]  It really shows that there's a crisis of conscience happening and this is very positive overall.
[01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:18.513]  And analyzing the undersecretary and analyzing the generals and analyzing the Air Force TV producers that got up with tears in their eyes and said, I don't like lying to people.
[01:16:18.513 --> 01:16:19.613]  They don't believe us anymore.
[01:16:19.613 --> 01:16:24.215]  I want to tell the truth.
[01:16:24.215 --> 01:16:26.636]  And the undersecretary says, we're going to work on that and try.
[01:16:28.357 --> 01:16:30.979]  Imagine, they know PsyOps in there.
[01:16:30.979 --> 01:16:33.781]  They know what I'm talking about is true.
[01:16:33.781 --> 01:16:36.143]  They know how much trouble we're in.
[01:16:36.143 --> 01:16:43.068]  And they're like, I didn't sign on to work for Stalin or Hitler.
[01:16:43.068 --> 01:16:46.671]  But it's not one guy you can go after like Hitler and Operation Valkyrie.
[01:16:46.671 --> 01:16:48.072]  I wish that was the case.
[01:16:48.072 --> 01:16:51.634]  It's a demonic system, a corrupt society.
[01:16:51.634 --> 01:16:52.975]  The globalists have been smart about this.
[01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:53.836]  They do it by committee.
[01:16:55.493 --> 01:16:59.536]  And we're just living in times that are so incredible it makes my head spin.
[01:16:59.536 --> 01:17:00.977]  That's all I can say here.
[01:17:00.977 --> 01:17:03.378]  And the most awake group is the military.
[01:17:03.378 --> 01:17:06.180]  The next most awake group, if you believe it or not, are police.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.142]  Because they know the bull.
[01:17:08.142 --> 01:17:09.582]  They know they're told a lot of people.
[01:17:09.582 --> 01:17:11.464]  They know the system's getting corrupt.
[01:17:11.464 --> 01:17:13.385]  They know the argument is, well, we're under attack.
[01:17:13.385 --> 01:17:14.526]  Things are collapsing.
[01:17:14.526 --> 01:17:15.366]  We've got to do it.
[01:17:15.366 --> 01:17:19.949]  But now they realize we're not lying to try to fix freedom and have a free society.
[01:17:19.949 --> 01:17:22.271]  We're lying to help the corrupt continue.
[01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:23.132]  And that's right.
[01:17:23.132 --> 01:17:24.793]  We need to let it all come out, folks.
[01:17:25.773 --> 01:17:30.118]  And even if America collapses, that's better than going into a hyper-tyranny.
[01:17:30.118 --> 01:17:32.200]  For all of us.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.862]  And I don't even want that to happen.
[01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:42.691]  I want to just convert away from tyranny, back to the republic, prosecute the globalists, but even if they just would leave the country, the problem is they're not going to stop.
[01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:43.532]  They've got to be dealt with.
[01:17:44.687 --> 01:17:46.287]  We've been hijacked by foreign banks.
[01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:47.508]  We've been usurped.
[01:17:47.508 --> 01:17:48.488]  Those aren't terms.
[01:17:48.488 --> 01:17:49.628]  That's a fact.
[01:17:49.628 --> 01:17:51.369]  That's not rhetoric, folks.
[01:17:51.369 --> 01:17:53.970]  The globalists brag there's been a corporate takeover.
[01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:55.150]  It's illegitimate.
[01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:56.150]  It's illegal.
[01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:59.231]  We got a clean house.
[01:17:59.231 --> 01:18:02.372]  And I don't like being the tip of the spear, but it's my duty.
[01:18:02.372 --> 01:18:03.933]  Let's go to Joe in New Jersey.
[01:18:03.933 --> 01:18:04.593]  You're on the air.
[01:18:04.593 --> 01:18:06.413]  Welcome, sir.
[01:18:06.413 --> 01:18:08.234]  Hi, Alex Jones.
[01:18:09.625 --> 01:18:15.227]  I want to be careful here because I don't want to be disrespectful and I don't want you to think I'm questioning you.
[01:18:15.227 --> 01:18:17.068]  I'm questioning the system.
[01:18:17.068 --> 01:18:24.210]  You yourself are stating how the level of psyops and tyranny goes beyond the bounds that we can even comprehend.
[01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:26.031]  Couldn't it be possible
[01:18:27.318 --> 01:18:36.980]  For a PSYOP to be placed against the target dissidents that you were discussing in the form of a radio show like InfoWarpz.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:44.121]  Now, what I wanted to do is because I'm not like these other people who just try and batten out you.
[01:18:44.121 --> 01:18:44.961]  I want you to be with me.
[01:18:44.961 --> 01:18:51.022]  Oh, you mean the private PSYOP companies that we've proven attack us 24-7 on record saying we're government agents?
[01:18:51.022 --> 01:18:51.502]  Exactly.
[01:18:51.502 --> 01:18:52.242]  I'm not like that.
[01:18:52.242 --> 01:18:53.062]  I want you to be with me.
[01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:54.543]  Well, just ask your question, sir.
[01:18:54.543 --> 01:18:55.763]  I don't care if you ask me a question.
[01:18:55.763 --> 01:18:56.043]  Go ahead.
[01:18:56.929 --> 01:18:58.531]  Well, I don't want you, I don't want to put you on the spot.
[01:18:58.531 --> 01:19:00.914]  Well, no, no, let me stop you right there, because this is the thing.
[01:19:00.914 --> 01:19:03.296]  I don't screen your calls.
[01:19:03.296 --> 01:19:05.379]  But then everybody wants me to screen their calls on air.
[01:19:07.245 --> 01:19:10.908]  And a PSYOP show would be screening calls.
[01:19:10.908 --> 01:19:14.770]  But this is about changing the subject over to Alex Jones.
[01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:21.715]  Quite frankly, if weak-minded people want to think I'm an operative or something, they're welcome to it because they've never counted anyways.
[01:19:21.715 --> 01:19:27.319]  I'm looking for men and women who want justice and freedom and who are intelligent to try to restore the republic.
[01:19:28.166 --> 01:19:37.115]  And I'm here promoting the Bill of Rights, Constitution, transparency, and not having a civil war, and that our government's running Al-Qaeda, and that our government's illegitimate.
[01:19:37.115 --> 01:19:42.020]  Any moron would know that I'm not a PSYOP.
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:46.905]  If I'm a PSYOP, I am the organic resistance to tyranny.
[01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:51.318]  And so, there's never any proof of a PSYOP.
[01:19:51.318 --> 01:20:04.088]  I mean, my enemies will come to an event I've put on, tell me to leave my own event, shoot deceptive angles as if I've crashed my own event, to then say that I go crashing events when I could go speak to 5,000 people next week if I wanted to.
[01:20:04.088 --> 01:20:11.413]  They do PSYOPs like sit behind me and yell, kill Michelle Malkin and have the national news ready to run that I said kill Michelle Malkin.
[01:20:11.413 --> 01:20:14.976]  They run hoaxes and say that I said Obama sent a tornado to the thing.
[01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:25.108]  They have the globalist attacking me, trying to bring me down, running dirty tricks you couldn't believe, and then you call in and say, what if your show's a PSYOP?
[01:20:25.108 --> 01:20:26.510]  Let's just stop right there.
[01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:29.254]  For your mind, let me explain how a PSYOP works, okay?
[01:20:29.254 --> 01:20:30.115]  There's many different types.
[01:20:31.735 --> 01:20:53.130]  The ultimate sci-op in the cognitive infiltration of Cass Sunstein, that he wrote about six years ago at Harvard, five years ago at Chicago Business School, and four years ago at the White House, and then two years ago as its regulations are, and in public speeches and the rest of it, was to create fake alternative media to claim they were conspiracy theorists, people that question.
[01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:53.531]  Go read it!
[01:20:54.011 --> 01:21:08.200]  To fight with each other and claim all the real people are agents so that there's no clear leadership to make the debate about who's real in the movement, classic divide and conquer, instead of, let's get foreign banks out of America.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.261]  Let's stop having them shut down our power plants.
[01:21:11.261 --> 01:21:16.024]  Let's stop having them ship General Motors to China with taxpayer money, 21 billion.
[01:21:16.024 --> 01:21:19.146]  Let's get the federal government out of education and out of our churches.
[01:21:19.146 --> 01:21:20.667]  Let's stand up for free speech.
[01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:21.968]  Let's keep our police local.
[01:21:22.168 --> 01:21:26.972]  Let's have a state's rights movement to block Obamacare, which is starting to happen.
[01:21:26.972 --> 01:21:32.156]  Let's give people that they can believe in each other and have an option from tyranny and collectivism.
[01:21:32.156 --> 01:21:33.617]  Let's keep our families together.
[01:21:33.617 --> 01:21:35.278]  Let's not abort babies.
[01:21:35.278 --> 01:21:37.079]  The vaccines are dangerous.
[01:21:37.079 --> 01:21:38.621]  GMO is dangerous.
[01:21:38.621 --> 01:21:39.962]  Filter your water.
[01:21:39.962 --> 01:21:43.284]  I mean, my God, if I'm a... And it's a pure distraction.
[01:21:43.284 --> 01:21:45.306]  Now you got one minute, there's no evidence.
[01:21:52.406 --> 01:21:53.826]  And it's a pure distraction.
[01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.027]  Now you've got one minute and I've got to go to other people.
[01:21:56.027 --> 01:21:57.407]  Go ahead.
[01:21:57.407 --> 01:21:59.027]  I do not want to dis- There he goes!
[01:21:59.027 --> 01:21:59.587]  Boom!
[01:21:59.587 --> 01:22:00.107]  Boom!
[01:22:00.107 --> 01:22:00.628]  Boom!
[01:22:00.628 --> 01:22:01.268]  Boom!
[01:22:01.268 --> 01:22:03.348]  Give me the proof of the PSYOP man!
[01:22:03.348 --> 01:22:05.929]  The PSYOP is I got red blood!
[01:22:05.929 --> 01:22:06.389]  You got it?
[01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:06.909]  Come on!
[01:22:06.909 --> 01:22:07.409]  Come on!
[01:22:07.409 --> 01:22:08.009]  Come on!
[01:22:08.009 --> 01:22:13.710]  There's a thing called, you have to state to the public audience what you're going to do.
[01:22:13.710 --> 01:22:18.671]  By you reading from the AP, from the news sources that are already designed and designated
[01:22:20.332 --> 01:22:26.414]  You're doing nothing but by perpetrating the false spin story that is already being put out there by these news sources.
[01:22:26.414 --> 01:22:32.136]  There's a thing called Mind Wars written in 1980, which specifically details your radio show.
[01:22:32.136 --> 01:22:34.477]  It specifically details your show, man.
[01:22:34.477 --> 01:22:36.498]  Your show's named Info Wars.
[01:22:36.498 --> 01:22:40.739]  I don't want to, I want you to be legit, but there's legitimate issues there, man.
[01:22:40.739 --> 01:22:44.041]  There are real things, and I don't want you to have to try and answer this now.
[01:22:44.041 --> 01:22:47.282]  Take the time, research it, and then- Research it, okay.
[01:22:47.822 --> 01:22:51.083]  Well, how would I research if I was a PSYOP?
[01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:52.264]  How would I research that?
[01:22:52.264 --> 01:22:54.444]  I know I'm not!
[01:22:54.444 --> 01:22:57.165]  And I hope you're not, and I actually believe you're not.
[01:22:57.165 --> 01:22:57.926]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:22:57.926 --> 01:23:02.047]  I'm almost trying to give you the opportunity because you talk about infighting so much.
[01:23:02.047 --> 01:23:08.309]  Well, there's the Truth Movement, I don't know if you've noticed, it's split up between people who believe Alex Jones and who don't believe Alex Jones.
[01:23:08.309 --> 01:23:09.349]  Yeah, I know, that's the PSYOP.
[01:23:09.349 --> 01:23:14.091]  Look, I appreciate your call and I'll let you talk some because you actually made a couple points.
[01:23:14.091 --> 01:23:16.392]  And the issue is, do you understand, sir,
[01:23:17.745 --> 01:23:25.287]  The PSYOP is that now we're going to debate Alex Jones and is he for real?
[01:23:25.287 --> 01:23:36.229]  Instead of the fact that the mainstream media has lost all credibility and the states are moving to try to defend our Second Amendment and everything else.
[01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:37.950]  It's amazing.
[01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:38.870]  It's very, very sad.
[01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:40.850]  And the people always say the same thing.
[01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:43.871]  Respond to every fake claim
[01:23:45.396 --> 01:23:54.499]  So that my show becomes a response to fake claims and not about the news and the issues and how the world works.
[01:23:54.499 --> 01:24:03.702]  Of course I'll take a White House transcript and show how they're lying and post the transcript and then say where they're lying.
[01:24:04.835 --> 01:24:06.699]  Of course I take a video.
[01:24:06.699 --> 01:24:07.440]  I see that in the comments.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.303]  Why are you showing Obama and his propaganda?
[01:24:09.303 --> 01:24:16.977]  Well, I show Obama saying, you know, that he wouldn't hire any lobbyists three times here, and then I show him right below it hiring record lobbyists.
[01:24:18.544 --> 01:24:22.487]  I mean, it's almost like child-like.
[01:24:22.487 --> 01:24:28.491]  The only psy-op I can be guilty of is misgaging the public by thinking people are like me.
[01:24:28.491 --> 01:24:30.053]  And I've admitted this.
[01:24:30.053 --> 01:24:33.915]  And I've tried to think of where I help the system, because nothing's perfect.
[01:24:33.915 --> 01:24:38.139]  And undoubtedly, the system's not one monolithic thing either.
[01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:39.640]  That's a psy-op as well.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:47.766]  But I realize that when I get up here and talk about all this horrible news sometimes, for people that are scared and unempowered, it may make them give up and have learned helplessness.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.822]  But I believe in standing against a threat.
[01:24:52.822 --> 01:24:58.946]  I mean, you know, some guy comes and starts a fight with me, I try to defuse it, but if they start swinging, I start stomping their butt in the ground.
[01:24:58.946 --> 01:25:04.910]  I mean, it's not... So, I don't, like, roll over and show my belly, folks.
[01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:14.896]  And so, I mean, what you're getting is an American fighting stance that's as Americana as anything's ever been, or is just free human.
[01:25:14.896 --> 01:25:18.659]  And I go... Again, that's the PSYOP.
[01:25:21.022 --> 01:25:27.205]  And, you know, I'm sitting there with Vic Vreeland, a firefighter.
[01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:28.925]  He comes up to the station.
[01:25:28.925 --> 01:25:29.526]  I'm friends with him.
[01:25:29.526 --> 01:25:30.566]  He has an AXS TV show.
[01:25:30.566 --> 01:25:35.668]  He comes up to KJFK in 1996, late 1996, and he goes, you need a website.
[01:25:35.668 --> 01:25:36.528]  Come over to my house.
[01:25:36.528 --> 01:25:39.990]  I'd had dinner there before with him and his wife and his kids were growing up.
[01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:42.391]  I've had Vic Vreeland on it forever.
[01:25:44.228 --> 01:25:47.190]  And I go over to his house, and Petey, oh, that old parrot died.
[01:25:47.190 --> 01:25:48.351]  I was real sad to hear Petey died.
[01:25:48.351 --> 01:25:54.315]  I haven't seen Vic Vreeland in years, and I'm having dinner with him and his wife, and he says, I'm gonna set up a website for you.
[01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:59.558]  And we sat around for a couple hours thinking, what's a name, what's a name, what's a name?
[01:25:59.558 --> 01:26:08.064]  And I, of course, I've read so many history books and things, I said, well, we need to, you know, call it InfoWars.
[01:26:08.064 --> 01:26:11.486]  And he said, yeah, because there's a war on, for your mind.
[01:26:11.486 --> 01:26:12.507]  He'd also been in the Air Force.
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.800]  Firefighters in town know Vic Vreeland.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:20.202]  He was a senior firefighter when he retired.
[01:26:20.202 --> 01:26:23.623]  He had just about retired then.
[01:26:23.623 --> 01:26:25.703]  Last time I heard he retired out to Bastrop or something.
[01:26:25.703 --> 01:26:27.063]  Have we got Vic Vreeland on?
[01:26:27.063 --> 01:26:28.824]  That was a great guy, man.
[01:26:28.824 --> 01:26:29.684]  That was a great guy.
[01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:39.427]  And I think he'd even filled in a few times for like Tom Valentine, that great Patriot Talk Show host.
[01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:39.607]  But
[01:26:41.912 --> 01:26:46.696]  I remember sitting there while Petey, while Petey sat on my lap and I fed him peanuts.
[01:26:46.696 --> 01:26:49.638]  Big ol' cockatoo.
[01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:51.380]  And we had a good Italian dinner over there.
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:55.903]  I think it was his wife was Italian.
[01:26:55.903 --> 01:26:58.165]  But the point was, maybe Vreeland is, I don't remember.
[01:26:58.165 --> 01:27:00.407]  And I sat there and that's where InfoWars came from.
[01:27:00.407 --> 01:27:04.390]  And then I sit there and here's some guy, you know, because back then people weren't getting good domain names.
[01:27:06.711 --> 01:27:08.591]  And now the whole show gets taken over by that.
[01:27:08.591 --> 01:27:09.372]  It's very painful.
[01:27:09.372 --> 01:27:10.692]  It's very, very sad.
[01:27:10.692 --> 01:27:12.432]  But it's not just PSYOPs.
[01:27:12.432 --> 01:27:15.113]  People are jealous of success.
[01:27:15.113 --> 01:27:19.253]  And so you can be a big man if you make something up about Alex Jones.
[01:27:19.253 --> 01:27:20.233]  That I'm Bill Hicks.
[01:27:20.233 --> 01:27:22.254]  That I work for the Vatican when I'm not even Catholic.
[01:27:22.254 --> 01:27:23.694]  Nothing against Catholics.
[01:27:23.694 --> 01:27:26.214]  I'm attacked because I don't attack Catholics.
[01:27:26.214 --> 01:27:28.335]  Or that I work for the Masons.
[01:27:28.335 --> 01:27:35.096]  Or that I work for... And then I'll get up on air and say, I've had family that were Masons, high level, and they said, don't become part of it.
[01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:39.791]  And then that proves I'm a Mason.
[01:27:39.791 --> 01:27:46.253]  Because high-level Masons in my family have said there's some pretty bad stuff in it at the highest levels.
[01:27:46.253 --> 01:27:52.075]  Or I say I've had family in the Army recruited by the CIA who got out of it saying it was really bad.
[01:27:52.075 --> 01:27:53.256]  And then that's the proof I'm CIA.
[01:27:53.256 --> 01:28:02.679]  I mean, how do you expect whistleblowers to ever come out or ever say anything if when they do you go, you must be a PSYOP, you don't know how to judge things.
[01:28:02.679 --> 01:28:06.020]  And I guess it's a wrecked fluoride head population.
[01:28:07.361 --> 01:28:08.843]  I get that.
[01:28:08.843 --> 01:28:10.325]  But I'm not going to be diverted off that.
[01:28:10.325 --> 01:28:11.867]  I answered your question.
[01:28:11.867 --> 01:28:17.233]  I mean, let's say I was a bad guy, which I'm not.
[01:28:17.233 --> 01:28:18.615]  You know, on my children.
[01:28:18.615 --> 01:28:20.257]  That means nothing.
[01:28:20.257 --> 01:28:21.779]  In front of God, but God knows.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:26.221]  Isn't it about you?
[01:28:26.221 --> 01:28:39.507]  What are you doing to go warn people when they say it's the law every year in every public school system to take vaccines that give them 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 shots at a time and kids actually pass out when they're doing thousands of inoculations?
[01:28:39.507 --> 01:28:41.028]  They may have 20 people go to the hospital.
[01:28:41.028 --> 01:28:42.629]  They have ambulances standing by.
[01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:46.511]  Kids go into the third round of shots when they're 18 months, have convulsions in the hospital.
[01:28:46.511 --> 01:28:47.571]  Are you there warning people?
[01:28:47.571 --> 01:28:49.893]  Do you walk up to pregnant women and warn them in stores?
[01:28:49.893 --> 01:28:50.853]  Because you know what?
[01:28:50.853 --> 01:28:51.834]  I do.
[01:28:51.834 --> 01:28:53.294]  And not because I'm some goody two-shoe.
[01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.335]  I'm worried about that kid.
[01:28:55.199 --> 01:28:57.520]  Do you go and warn people about fluoride in the water?
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:59.660]  Do you go and warn them about GMO?
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:03.862]  Do you go and warn people about how dangerous the CPS is?
[01:29:03.862 --> 01:29:07.183]  Or that, hey, you're pregnant, you kind of look like hippie-type folks.
[01:29:07.183 --> 01:29:08.363]  Are you going to have that baby in a hospital?
[01:29:08.363 --> 01:29:09.924]  Yeah, we are, in the next few weeks.
[01:29:09.924 --> 01:29:12.044]  Well, have you smoked any pot in the last month?
[01:29:12.044 --> 01:29:15.845]  They're going to test your blood, tell you it's a blood test, not tell you, and take your kid on the spot. 100%.
[01:29:17.754 --> 01:29:18.835]  Really?
[01:29:18.835 --> 01:29:21.076]  I don't smoke a lot of pot, but I've had a little bit.
[01:29:21.076 --> 01:29:23.238]  Yeah, well, you better midwife that baby right now.
[01:29:23.238 --> 01:29:24.559]  I mean, that's what I do.
[01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:25.600]  That's what I do.
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.961]  Because I love humanity.
[01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:28.722]  And I don't want to see people persecuted.
[01:29:28.722 --> 01:29:34.086]  And all you can do is call in and ask me if I'm a psy-op and why you show news articles.
[01:29:34.086 --> 01:29:35.527]  What does that even mean?
[01:29:37.078 --> 01:29:38.379]  And so there you go.
[01:29:38.379 --> 01:29:40.041]  So let me just say this so you can feel good.
[01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.622]  I'm a bad government operative.
[01:29:41.622 --> 01:29:43.003]  You're a good person.
[01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:44.724]  We've established you're better than me.
[01:29:44.724 --> 01:29:46.345]  You smoked me out.
[01:29:46.345 --> 01:29:50.528]  Now what are you going to do to go warn people?
[01:29:50.528 --> 01:29:52.870]  What are you going to do to help them?
[01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:54.271]  We're on the march.
[01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:56.793]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.793 --> 01:29:59.495]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:07.751 --> 01:30:09.012]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:09.012 --> 01:30:12.874]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:15.335]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:15.335 --> 01:30:21.039]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:21.039 --> 01:30:27.702]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:27.702 --> 01:30:33.666]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:33.666 --> 01:30:37.388]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:37.868 --> 01:30:42.151]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:42.151 --> 01:30:48.095]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:48.095 --> 01:30:51.658]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:51.658 --> 01:30:53.619]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:53.619 --> 01:30:54.760]  It's here.

[01:31:03.646 --> 01:31:04.906]  What does freedom mean to you?
[01:31:04.906 --> 01:31:08.048]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[01:31:08.048 --> 01:31:11.869]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.
[01:31:11.869 --> 01:31:21.252]  In July, for every $329 you spend on our highly nutritious, great-tasting food, you will receive a $190 Patriot Pack free.
[01:31:21.252 --> 01:31:26.074]  For example, purchase a six-month supply and get three Patriot Packs free.
[01:31:26.074 --> 01:31:31.336]  The Patriot Pack is a 24-day supply of eFoods Quick Fix Easy-to-Store Food,
[01:31:34.221 --> 01:31:34.541]  I think so.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:07.262]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:32:07.262 --> 01:32:12.765]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:32:12.765 --> 01:32:20.509]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:32:20.509 --> 01:32:29.593]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:32:29.813 --> 01:32:36.983]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:32:36.983 --> 01:32:39.867]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:32:39.867 --> 01:32:46.816]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[01:32:47.336 --> 01:32:48.417]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:32:48.417 --> 01:32:49.658]  Another plane just hit!
[01:32:49.658 --> 01:32:50.759]  State of Mind.
[01:32:50.759 --> 01:32:52.321]  Because there's a war on.
[01:32:52.321 --> 01:32:53.342]  For your mind.
[01:32:53.342 --> 01:32:57.525]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:57.525 --> 01:33:02.630]  And remember, every order at InfoWarsStore.com receives a free citizen rulebook.
[01:33:14.836 --> 01:33:18.418]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:18.418 --> 01:33:23.941]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:23.941 --> 01:33:31.164]  You know, I'm actually glad that guy called.
[01:33:31.164 --> 01:33:33.966]  But it's like calling up and going, how do we know you're not a rapist?
[01:33:33.966 --> 01:33:35.887]  Or how do we know you're not robbing banks?
[01:33:35.887 --> 01:33:39.489]  Or how do we know you're not got children buried in a basement in your house?
[01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:41.810]  I mean, it's like fighting words.
[01:33:44.073 --> 01:34:00.906]  But don't you expect if there was an Alex Jones, a guy who for 18 years climbed up through little bitty radio stations and, you know, today is on mom and pops across the country and has been able to get people nationwide really talking about the tyranny we're going into.
[01:34:00.906 --> 01:34:04.288]  The globalists haven't fully taken over yet.
[01:34:04.288 --> 01:34:07.371]  And we're desperately trying to hold it back, trying to keep the gate shut.
[01:34:07.371 --> 01:34:08.772]  They're climbing over.
[01:34:08.772 --> 01:34:11.534]  And people are like, how do you know there's something behind that gate?
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:15.022]  That's one half the population, you know, that's in denial.
[01:34:15.022 --> 01:34:18.005]  And the other half that's in denial is like, how do we know you're not one of them?
[01:34:18.005 --> 01:34:19.466]  And I'm like, I'm holding this gate back!
[01:34:19.466 --> 01:34:20.627]  Get up here and help me!
[01:34:20.627 --> 01:34:26.132]  And spears are coming through it, and fireballs are coming over the top of the Dillinger stand, and I'm going, no!
[01:34:26.132 --> 01:34:28.894]  I say you're with the army on the other side.
[01:34:28.894 --> 01:34:32.177]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:34:32.177 --> 01:34:34.879]  And I think that guy just was uninformed.
[01:34:34.879 --> 01:34:37.922]  But a lot of the people pushing that line are definitely for the other side.
[01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:41.414]  I say the people holding the gate up are actually with the enemy.
[01:34:41.414 --> 01:34:44.977]  How about we arrest them and leave no one at the gate?
[01:34:44.977 --> 01:34:47.239]  How dare that person fighting the New World Order?
[01:34:47.239 --> 01:34:50.022]  I bet he's one of them!
[01:34:50.022 --> 01:34:52.284]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:34:52.284 --> 01:34:56.027]  How many globalist operations have we blown wide open and damaged?
[01:34:56.027 --> 01:34:57.608]  How much do they hate us?
[01:34:57.608 --> 01:35:02.072]  How much do they lie about me, trying to destroy me?
[01:35:02.072 --> 01:35:03.854]  Believe me, you know who knows I'm for real?
[01:35:04.858 --> 01:35:07.380]  God knows, but the New World Order knows, too.
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:10.341]  Let me tell you what.
[01:35:10.341 --> 01:35:12.063]  Boy, I tell you.
[01:35:12.063 --> 01:35:13.483]  But folks, don't even defend me.
[01:35:13.483 --> 01:35:16.225]  I've said this many times to my listeners.
[01:35:16.225 --> 01:35:20.768]  Do not defend me on YouTube and InfoWars.com and other sites.
[01:35:20.768 --> 01:35:21.789]  Don't feed the trolls.
[01:35:22.682 --> 01:35:25.284]  Find an issue that you've researched that you know is accurate.
[01:35:25.284 --> 01:35:26.405]  Warn other people.
[01:35:26.405 --> 01:35:27.505]  Get involved.
[01:35:27.505 --> 01:35:29.187]  Fight the New World Order.
[01:35:29.187 --> 01:35:31.488]  The globalists want to divide and conquer us.
[01:35:31.488 --> 01:35:33.029]  We teach this over and over again.
[01:35:33.029 --> 01:35:34.290]  It's common sense.
[01:35:34.290 --> 01:35:34.911]  It's history.
[01:35:34.911 --> 01:35:36.212]  Everybody already knows that.
[01:35:36.212 --> 01:35:40.415]  And Cass Sunstein said, we're going to go in and say everybody in the truth movement is a government agent.
[01:35:41.195 --> 01:35:44.757]  I'll be honest with you, most of them are not government agents that are infighting.
[01:35:44.757 --> 01:35:49.100]  They're just jealous, envious, screwed up, bad products of this society.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:36:04.371]  Narcissists that are into this to try to be stars, not into liberty for the great animating contest for a future for their children because they're very guts, they're very sinew, they're very cells, they're very soul, they're very stamp.
[01:36:04.371 --> 01:36:10.555]  Their very essence is to be free and to be just outraged by manifest corruption.
[01:36:11.696 --> 01:36:16.741]  I see big purple green clouds on a spring day and funnel clouds spinning.
[01:36:16.741 --> 01:36:20.784]  I don't need to get my iPhone now and look and see if there's tornadoes forming.
[01:36:20.784 --> 01:36:25.128]  I know to try to get to shelter because I've grown up around tornadoes in Dallas, Texas.
[01:36:25.128 --> 01:36:30.132]  Saw them every year with my eyeballs.
[01:36:30.132 --> 01:36:32.294]  That's why when I hear there's more tornadoes, I look up the numbers.
[01:36:32.294 --> 01:36:34.056]  They're 60 year low.
[01:36:34.056 --> 01:36:35.937]  I hardly ever see them now.
[01:36:35.937 --> 01:36:37.379]  I saw them all the time when I was a kid.
[01:36:39.138 --> 01:36:40.158]  Don't believe me?
[01:36:40.158 --> 01:36:43.979]  The National Weather Service says 60-year low for tornadoes.
[01:36:43.979 --> 01:36:45.399]  But the point is, I've seen it.
[01:36:45.399 --> 01:36:46.239]  I know it.
[01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:49.120]  People know common sense when they see it.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:59.942]  And the globalists just want to change the subject to like, you know, he's talking about cancer viruses and vaccines and telling you, you know, it's declassified, look it up, which you can do in five seconds.
[01:36:59.942 --> 01:37:03.023]  He's a Vatican assassin!
[01:37:03.023 --> 01:37:04.143]  Charlie Sheen admitted it.
[01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:08.471]  And then people go, well, prove you're not a Vatican assassin.
[01:37:08.471 --> 01:37:13.435]  Charlie Sheen said, you and he are Vatican assassins.
[01:37:13.435 --> 01:37:19.639]  Folks, Charlie Sheen is a comic person, and we've sat around at his house many times.
[01:37:19.639 --> 01:37:21.581]  His favorite form of entertainment is also one of mine.
[01:37:21.581 --> 01:37:22.801]  I don't do it now because it's bad.
[01:37:22.801 --> 01:37:28.425]  I've repented of it, is watching attack videos because they're so funny, watching schizophrenics on YouTube.
[01:37:28.425 --> 01:37:33.149]  Because there are a lot of schizophrenics now that never before had a venue to a newspaper, basically.
[01:37:33.689 --> 01:37:35.630]  That's part of this new free press, you know.
[01:37:35.630 --> 01:37:41.954]  Some would argue that's what I am, but we know I'm just basically eccentric and I think I have high intelligence, obviously, and I've studied some history.
[01:37:41.954 --> 01:37:50.179]  But, I mean, it's entertaining to watch schizophrenics that think, you know, the water meter reader is a CIA agent outside their house, and to sit there and watch it.
[01:37:50.179 --> 01:37:54.341]  It's funny to watch people, you know, saying that I'm really a reptoid or Bill Hicks.
[01:37:54.341 --> 01:37:58.044]  I mean, it's funny, until you realize the family's upset about it.
[01:37:58.991 --> 01:38:05.755]  It's very painful to the Hicks family that people have actually contacted him and said, we know your son's not dead and stuff like that.
[01:38:05.755 --> 01:38:17.603]  But, but, but, you know, when he's buried and I've talked to him and they were there when he died and it was very sad and you know, that's the type of stuff going on out there because the establishments lost all credibility.
[01:38:17.603 --> 01:38:18.724]  They're a pack of liars.
[01:38:20.339 --> 01:38:30.284]  Now the dumbed-down mass that at least had the rudder of mainstream media to believe that, now they don't know what's true, so they're just making up what's true for whatever they want.
[01:38:30.284 --> 01:38:36.207]  I mean, if I tell you about the CIA, I've read dozens of books on it, and studied it, and watched congressional hearings.
[01:38:36.207 --> 01:38:40.670]  Or if I tell you I know about GMO, I've interviewed, let's not exaggerate,
[01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:52.323]  Hundreds of experts and doctors and genetic engineers and top scientists and patent holders on, you know, some of the top GMO out there that they tell you does kill the rodents that eat it.
[01:38:52.323 --> 01:38:54.846]  And just constant research and living it.
[01:38:59.952 --> 01:39:06.918]  And so I don't blame a dumbed-down mass out there that's smart enough to know they're being lied to, but not smart enough to figure out what's going on.
[01:39:06.918 --> 01:39:09.960]  Cass Sunstein says, well, we'll just get them all fighting with each other.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.883]  We'll go in, we'll put out fake conspiracy theories.
[01:39:12.883 --> 01:39:19.808]  We will just muddy the water so much, and we'll get everybody fighting with each other, and we'll target our real opposition by saying they're feds.
[01:39:19.808 --> 01:39:20.229]  Go read it!
[01:39:21.730 --> 01:39:24.112]  So that then the whole debate becomes about that.
[01:39:24.112 --> 01:39:31.397]  And it's effective if you don't... In fact, a lot of people say, that was a psy-op, him letting that guy be on.
[01:39:31.397 --> 01:39:36.881]  Well, no it's not, because I then used it as a teaching moment.
[01:39:36.881 --> 01:39:38.383]  That's what I do.
[01:39:38.383 --> 01:39:41.225]  From my perspective, doesn't mean I have all the answers.
[01:39:41.225 --> 01:39:47.890]  First I go through anger, then I go through sadness, then I just go through analyzing it and covering it for the person, because it's painful.
[01:39:48.956 --> 01:39:56.978]  To realize that there are millions of minds shuddered who will now be completely nasty their whole life, believing anyone that resists tyranny is the worst.
[01:39:56.978 --> 01:40:04.060]  Because you notice half the radio shows, half the websites, half the YouTubes, I mean literally half, they don't fight the New World Order, folks.
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.860]  That's too big and powerful for them.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:08.861]  They can't imagine they could ever beat something there, even though they could.
[01:40:08.861 --> 01:40:11.582]  But it's easy to, you know, fight with each other.
[01:40:12.222 --> 01:40:13.243]  They don't even really attack me.
[01:40:13.243 --> 01:40:19.368]  Now, I've kind of reached the point where they think they can't, you know, hurt me or whatever, and in a way they can't because it's not true and it's so much bull.
[01:40:19.368 --> 01:40:24.291]  But when you're fighting globalists, and it is true, and you've got real evidence, you can hurt them.
[01:40:24.291 --> 01:40:27.394]  Oh, but forget trying to slay that real giant politically.
[01:40:27.394 --> 01:40:33.799]  Let's just all tear each other apart in a mass schizoid, you know, crazy narcissist event.
[01:40:35.612 --> 01:40:37.713]  And it's television that's turned people into this.
[01:40:37.713 --> 01:40:42.497]  The brains have been wired wrong, the society is getting sick, and it's a crisis.
[01:40:42.497 --> 01:40:44.238]  Let's talk to Drew in Florida.
[01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:44.998]  Drew, you're on the air.
[01:40:44.998 --> 01:40:46.339]  Go ahead.
[01:40:46.339 --> 01:40:47.400]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:47.680]  Good.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:49.882]  You think that was instructive, what I talked about, or you disagree?
[01:40:51.161 --> 01:40:52.482]  I think you're doing a great job.
[01:40:52.482 --> 01:40:53.742]  I don't care what other people say.
[01:40:53.742 --> 01:40:56.363]  I'm a first-time listener and a long-time caller.
[01:40:56.363 --> 01:41:01.665]  I read, I saw this article about Michael Hastings and it had a video of the crash.
[01:41:01.665 --> 01:41:02.685]  It's on LA Times.
[01:41:02.685 --> 01:41:06.526]  It's called Michael Hastings Death, New Crash Video Emerges.
[01:41:06.526 --> 01:41:08.747]  And on the links, it has new video.
[01:41:08.747 --> 01:41:15.949]  And it's deleted now, but I upload it to my, I download it, analyze it frame by frame by frame.
[01:41:15.949 --> 01:41:20.551]  And you can clearly see something being ejected from the vehicle right before it blows up.
[01:41:21.312 --> 01:41:22.292]  I sent a link.
[01:41:22.292 --> 01:41:25.493]  I messaged David Knight and Don Salazar on Facebook.
[01:41:25.493 --> 01:41:26.094]  No, no.
[01:41:26.094 --> 01:41:27.634]  I actually, we posted this yesterday.
[01:41:27.634 --> 01:41:29.995]  We're playing the video now for TV viewers.
[01:41:29.995 --> 01:41:33.016]  The LA Times is reporting it.
[01:41:33.016 --> 01:41:36.077]  And last time I checked, the link is still up.
[01:41:36.077 --> 01:41:48.381]  New video, what they believe emerges, and it's a really grainy camera shot of a black and white surveillance camera showing a car going what looks about 70 miles an hour or so, maybe 80.
[01:41:49.421 --> 01:42:16.341]  And then looking like you see like a little explosion before it hits something you see a flash and then it looks like it blows up in a larger explosion off the road and who knows if it's real but but quite frankly it looks like you see it driving something detonates then it goes on another 50 yards or so up against the tree but it doesn't even look like the side of the road we'd previously seen so I don't know if it's real or not LA Times doesn't know what's your take on it?
[01:42:17.518 --> 01:42:25.423]  Um, I noticed that as I analyzed it frame by frame at 14.5 seconds, just like you said, you see something going the opposite way of the vehicle.
[01:42:25.423 --> 01:42:27.304]  Now, is that the way the engine traveled?
[01:42:27.304 --> 01:42:30.186]  Because it was right before the explosion.
[01:42:30.186 --> 01:42:36.349]  If we check at 14.5 seconds and at 4 frames, you see something before the explosion.
[01:42:36.349 --> 01:42:38.051]  I don't know if it's a reflection off the side?
[01:42:39.611 --> 01:42:42.372]  Yeah, we've now confirmed it's been taken off the L.A.
[01:42:42.372 --> 01:42:44.573]  Times in the original place.
[01:42:44.573 --> 01:42:49.416]  So, reportedly an investigative journalist got access to a restaurant and got it.
[01:42:49.416 --> 01:42:57.039]  And who knows, maybe it's got something we're not supposed to see because it's being pulled everywhere.
[01:42:57.039 --> 01:43:01.801]  And so you see it driving, then the flash under it, then it blows up.
[01:43:01.801 --> 01:43:02.982]  Looks pretty suspicious to me.
[01:43:03.956 --> 01:43:09.743]  Yeah, I just uploaded it to my YouTube video because I downloaded it off the web when it came out so I could analyze it.
[01:43:09.743 --> 01:43:10.984]  And it's on my YouTube page right now.
[01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:21.255]  No, you know, I saw the video yesterday and just looking at it again on the big screen in front of me, you clearly see a flash under the car long before then the big explosion.
[01:43:21.255 --> 01:43:22.357]  But that's amazing!
[01:43:22.987 --> 01:43:24.828]  And again, I get so overwhelmed.
[01:43:24.828 --> 01:43:29.790]  So many times the show ends and I go, oh, I didn't cover 10, 10 things, you know, I wanted to cover.
[01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:30.450]  I'm so glad.
[01:43:30.450 --> 01:43:33.231]  That's why we take calls that you brought that up.
[01:43:33.231 --> 01:43:35.912]  Uh, yeah, no, it looks like a bomb goes off underneath it.
[01:43:35.912 --> 01:43:39.814]  You see a pretty good explosion and then it goes on down the road and that's what, uh,
[01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:53.579]  That's what witnesses said, is that the car was going down the road, blew up, and then jackknife flipped, and then went off into the tree.
[01:43:53.579 --> 01:43:58.222]  And that's what the video looks like, but again, we don't know if it's real, LA Times doesn't know.
[01:43:58.222 --> 01:44:03.205]  The investigative reporter, it's off his site now, that says he, let's call him immediately.
[01:44:03.205 --> 01:44:05.107]  Email him, call that guy immediately.
[01:44:05.547 --> 01:44:05.687]  Alex?
[01:44:05.687 --> 01:44:05.727]  Me?
[01:44:33.274 --> 01:44:36.657]  Thank you for everything that you're doing for us.
[01:44:36.657 --> 01:44:38.458]  It's so important.
[01:44:38.458 --> 01:44:41.240]  Well listen, what comes around goes around, but let's be clear.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:44.283]  I am a giving, loving person, but I'm doing this for my family.
[01:44:44.283 --> 01:44:47.125]  And I'm doing this because I can't control myself.
[01:44:47.125 --> 01:44:50.608]  I mean, when I see tyranny taking over, doesn't everybody want to go resist it?
[01:44:50.608 --> 01:44:51.989]  I mean, isn't that normal?
[01:44:51.989 --> 01:44:53.670]  I'm just saying, folks, don't thank me
[01:44:55.256 --> 01:45:01.780]  It'd be like the compulsion if I was a single guy, you know, and Marilyn Monroe at her peak wanted to date me.
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:07.103]  I mean, don't thank me for dating Marilyn Monroe if I was a single guy and she's at her, you know, prime and wanted to date me.
[01:45:07.103 --> 01:45:10.524]  I mean, it's like, you know, don't thank me for winning the lottery here.
[01:45:10.524 --> 01:45:14.106]  I mean, and my point is I don't deserve to be thanked.
[01:45:14.106 --> 01:45:15.927]  I mean, why would I not want to fight the tyrants?
[01:45:15.927 --> 01:45:16.568]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:45:17.307 --> 01:45:18.007]  No, I do.
[01:45:18.007 --> 01:45:27.010]  And actually what I wanted to say was when I was growing up, I always wondered what it would be like to shake the hand of George Washington or Paul Revere.
[01:45:27.010 --> 01:45:34.673]  And you shook my hand and I felt it stoke the fire in my heart for liberty against tyranny.
[01:45:34.673 --> 01:45:43.396]  And I want to tell people that they need to understand Alex Jones is the archetypal living spirit of Paul Revere.
[01:45:43.396 --> 01:45:44.837]  Don't go there.
[01:45:44.837 --> 01:45:45.417]  I felt it.
[01:45:47.006 --> 01:45:48.047]  I felt it.
[01:45:48.047 --> 01:45:51.068]  Shaking your hand fulfilled my childhood dream.
[01:45:51.068 --> 01:45:59.432]  Even more than that, I knew that I was reaching out and touching the hand of freedom and history itself.
[01:45:59.432 --> 01:46:00.773]  Well, let me tell you, it humbles me.
[01:46:00.773 --> 01:46:02.074]  You know why I don't like doing public events?
[01:46:03.141 --> 01:46:09.748]  Is so humbling to see the light of liberty and the concern and how good our average listeners are.
[01:46:09.748 --> 01:46:11.450]  It is so humbling, it makes me want to cry.
[01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:16.916]  But it feels weird to me to have people admiring me.
[01:46:16.916 --> 01:46:18.397]  I mean, do you see what I'm saying?
[01:46:18.397 --> 01:46:22.402]  It's like, that's because I just want to fight the globalists.
[01:46:22.402 --> 01:46:23.102]  I don't want to be
[01:46:24.505 --> 01:46:25.506]  It's like George Washington.
[01:46:25.506 --> 01:46:26.526]  He didn't want to be president.
[01:46:26.526 --> 01:46:31.709]  He wanted to get out of there and go back to his beautiful farm and his family and his dogs.
[01:46:31.709 --> 01:46:33.510]  And I'm not saying I'm George Washington, folks.
[01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:34.510]  Believe me, I didn't.
[01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:40.593]  George Washington, you see all these Hollywood movies coming into Barbarian, all this stuff, and you think, oh, that's over the top.
[01:46:40.593 --> 01:46:45.436]  I mean, George Washington's life, the whole thing is like more over the top than a movie.
[01:46:46.491 --> 01:46:51.074]  And that's why you never see a movie about it, or they make him look like no big deal.
[01:46:51.074 --> 01:46:54.216]  Because they don't want you to have an idea of how incredible it was.
[01:46:54.216 --> 01:47:03.742]  Like, he was in more than 50 battles, where he would be up front with them shooting cannons and rifles at him, and he wasn't being killed, people all being killed around him.
[01:47:05.031 --> 01:47:09.575]  I mean, he was known before he even became General George Washington as, like, you know, Lucky George.
[01:47:09.575 --> 01:47:13.339]  And those guys, they say, have the, what do they call that in history, in the military?
[01:47:13.339 --> 01:47:15.942]  The touch, or they're charmed.
[01:47:15.942 --> 01:47:18.484]  They call it in the military being charmed.
[01:47:18.484 --> 01:47:21.367]  In fact, that's what Ford Coppola talked about in...
[01:47:22.824 --> 01:47:32.416]  Apocalypse Now, when you see the army colonel walk around with a helicopter, everybody's getting killed around him, mortars are going off, and it's like everybody knows that guy's never gonna get killed.
[01:47:32.416 --> 01:47:37.944]  And I'm telling you, George Washington could just have like a hundred people shooting right at him, and nothing would happen.
[01:47:37.944 --> 01:47:40.527]  I say, don't compare me to George Washington.
[01:47:40.527 --> 01:47:40.987]  Anything else?
[01:47:41.943 --> 01:47:51.453]  The eternal archetypal spirit that's part of everyone's destiny to fulfill, and it's like God reaches out and has certain protections for the people that are destined to fill those roles.
[01:47:51.453 --> 01:47:56.279]  I mean, there's no simpler way to explain it, but I did want to talk about something on topic.
[01:47:57.052 --> 01:48:00.954]  Uh, with the, uh, with the DOD coming out about their lying.
[01:48:00.954 --> 01:48:10.058]  I actually called and talked to you right after you were on Piers Morgan, and let me tell you, I was teared up, live teared up, when I saw you standing up for us against that hatchet, man.
[01:48:10.058 --> 01:48:11.158]  Because you knew what he was.
[01:48:11.158 --> 01:48:12.579]  People say, oh, he should have debated.
[01:48:12.579 --> 01:48:13.760]  The time for debate is over.
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:14.580]  We know what you are.
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:15.520]  We know what you're gonna do.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:16.461]  We know what you're here to do.
[01:48:17.041 --> 01:48:24.686]  And, you know, it's really, if it was George Washington, you know, he would have pulled out a gun and blew his head off before the guy even got on his show.
[01:48:24.686 --> 01:48:37.314]  But what I wanted to say was, is that when I called you to talk about gun control, I had called CNN, the state-run media, and you stopped me and you said, that's it, that's the word that we need to use for it.
[01:48:37.854 --> 01:48:40.316]  And I want to say that's an archetype too.
[01:48:40.316 --> 01:48:43.018]  We need to activate a very powerful archetype.
[01:49:08.235 --> 01:49:08.696]  You're right!
[01:49:08.696 --> 01:49:09.939]  It's state-run media!
[01:49:09.939 --> 01:49:10.460]  And that's it!
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:11.963]  It's not the parrot media!
[01:49:11.963 --> 01:49:13.667]  It's not the prestitute media!
[01:49:13.667 --> 01:49:15.090]  It's not the traitor media!
[01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:16.633]  It's not the Sessstream media!
[01:49:16.633 --> 01:49:18.336]  It's not the Decepticon media!
[01:49:18.336 --> 01:49:18.717]  It's not the...
[01:49:19.861 --> 01:49:23.663]  Scumbag media, they are reading off globalist psyops.
[01:49:23.663 --> 01:49:26.844]  Because the army realizes it's big banks writing the real psyops.
[01:49:26.844 --> 01:49:29.025]  They're junior to this and they don't like being part of it now.
[01:49:29.025 --> 01:49:31.006]  And I'm telling you, I know the military sources.
[01:49:31.006 --> 01:49:32.286]  They don't like what's happening.
[01:49:32.286 --> 01:49:33.287]  Who would?
[01:49:33.287 --> 01:49:37.128]  Everybody knows we're being conned, cheated, sold out.
[01:49:37.128 --> 01:49:38.509]  It just makes me so angry.
[01:49:38.509 --> 01:49:43.931]  Have you seen our story about the army psyop and them admitting they're a psyop?
[01:49:43.931 --> 01:49:45.192]  And what do you think's behind it?
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:47.700]  Yeah, I know what it is.
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:49.381]  It's state-run media model.
[01:49:49.381 --> 01:49:57.723]  I mean, when I used to read newspaper articles when I was a kid, I went to private school, I was taught to think critically, and I used to read the newspaper since I was... before I was 10.
[01:49:57.723 --> 01:50:00.824]  And I read it all the way through growing up till right now.
[01:50:00.824 --> 01:50:06.006]  And I'll tell you, every time we referred to the media outside this country when they were communists,
[01:50:06.386 --> 01:50:06.767]  I'm good.
[01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:22.131]  That will bring them down.
[01:50:22.131 --> 01:50:25.912]  We have state-run media that works for foreign banks that have occupied the country.
[01:50:25.912 --> 01:50:27.772]  And we are occupied!
[01:50:27.772 --> 01:50:35.115]  And they haven't shut us... They have occupied certain command bases and the infrastructure, but they're not occupying everything.
[01:50:35.115 --> 01:50:35.715]  That's the thing.
[01:50:35.715 --> 01:50:38.176]  They're trying a full occupation.
[01:50:38.176 --> 01:50:39.256]  Are we going to let them do it?
[01:50:40.566 --> 01:50:41.346]  No!
[01:50:41.346 --> 01:50:42.267]  The answer is no.
[01:50:42.267 --> 01:50:45.088]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[01:50:45.088 --> 01:50:49.469]  Brandon, Julio, Chris, Gabriel, everybody else, 800-259-9231.

[01:51:24.961 --> 01:51:36.105]  And you just can't beat a Big Berkey to remove dangerous chlorine, all types of fluoride, pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy byproducts from municipal water.
[01:51:36.105 --> 01:51:40.927]  Berkey water filter systems are even powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:47.329]  For the gold standard in water filters, get a Big Berkey at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:51:47.329 --> 01:51:51.731]  And all GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[01:51:53.392 --> 01:51:53.812]  That's 877-99-BERKEY.
[01:51:53.812 --> 01:51:55.053]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:51:55.053 --> 01:51:56.113]  For the love of clean water.
[01:52:05.191 --> 01:52:08.313]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[01:52:08.313 --> 01:52:09.694]  But what about the seventh?
[01:52:09.694 --> 01:52:13.977]  Unlike Ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[01:52:13.977 --> 01:52:15.518]  And it just won't quit.
[01:52:15.518 --> 01:52:22.223]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prepper, Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[01:52:22.223 --> 01:52:24.364]  That means safety and peace of mind.

[01:52:26.806 --> 01:52:30.788]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.

[01:52:32.269 --> 01:52:33.090]  Just won't quit.
[01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:39.232]  Introducing the only portable solar generator in the world that uses advanced sun tracking technology.
[01:52:39.232 --> 01:52:42.253]  The SunSocket Solar Generator from Aspect Solar.
[01:52:42.253 --> 01:52:44.814]  Featuring 60 watt rotating solar panels.
[01:52:44.814 --> 01:52:50.616]  A built-in 250 watt hour, lightweight lithium-ion battery that charges in only 5 hours.
[01:52:50.616 --> 01:52:52.316]  Multiple output sockets and more.
[01:52:52.316 --> 01:52:55.097]  See it in action at AspectSolar.com or call 877-717-7778.
[01:52:55.097 --> 01:52:55.377]  Call 877-717-7778.
[01:53:03.365 --> 01:53:04.626]  What does freedom mean to you?
[01:53:04.626 --> 01:53:07.768]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[01:53:07.768 --> 01:53:11.591]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.
[01:53:11.591 --> 01:53:20.977]  In July, for every $329 you spend on our highly nutritious, great-tasting food, you will receive a $190 Patriot Pack free.
[01:53:20.977 --> 01:53:25.801]  For example, purchase a six-month supply and get three Patriot Packs free.
[01:53:25.801 --> 01:53:33.046]  The Patriot Pack is a 24-day supply of eFoods quick-fix, easy-to-store food, plus stove, fuel, and cookware.
[01:53:33.046 --> 01:53:33.626]  I think so.
[01:54:14.596 --> 01:54:20.341]  By the way, in the next hour, for part of the second segment, David Knight's going to be in studio with us.
[01:54:20.341 --> 01:54:26.407]  And we're going to announce the third place winner of the Operation Paul Revere film contest.
[01:54:26.407 --> 01:54:28.749]  $115,000 in cash prizes.
[01:54:28.749 --> 01:54:32.672]  Third place today, second place tomorrow, first place on Wednesday.
[01:54:33.539 --> 01:54:34.980]  And then everybody gets paid out.
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:41.704]  We're going to probably even fly, not just the top three winners in, but maybe the top ten or so.
[01:54:41.704 --> 01:54:50.910]  Won't end up getting any money, but they'll be flown in to work with us to see about if they have ideas for films.
[01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:55.913]  Because that's really what this contest is about, is finding out who can make a film in two months.
[01:54:55.913 --> 01:54:59.195]  Because talk is cheap out there.
[01:54:59.195 --> 01:55:01.336]  And who wants to help us fight the New World Order.
[01:55:02.981 --> 01:55:07.704]  That's what this is really all about, is I'm trying to recruit people, because film is the big weapon.
[01:55:07.704 --> 01:55:14.988]  And I'm so busy with the radio, the print, all the rest of it, that I have been lacking in film production.
[01:55:14.988 --> 01:55:19.111]  I'm trying to make Obama Deception 2 right now while doing a hundred different things, and I'm not complaining.
[01:55:19.111 --> 01:55:22.653]  But go to InfoWars.com forward slash Paul.
[01:55:22.653 --> 01:55:25.915]  You'll see the Paul Revere site, the top 35 entries, and there's a link to about 300 others.
[01:55:27.577 --> 01:55:29.738]  But I salute everyone who was involved.
[01:55:29.738 --> 01:55:34.021]  And then we'll continue with your calls as well and the news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:55:34.021 --> 01:55:37.724]  But we're talking about the philosophy of this country and where is it going.
[01:55:37.724 --> 01:55:51.293]  And when you realize that you're not going to join evil, you're not going to join the globalists, when you think about all the crimes they've committed, and I can spiritually feel it as well, I want nothing to do with these people.
[01:55:51.293 --> 01:55:53.474]  And I must be against them and I must resist them.
[01:55:57.890 --> 01:56:08.957]  It's a compelling, over-driving fulfillment that is a hundred times the drive for sex when you're 16 years old.
[01:56:08.957 --> 01:56:13.019]  It's a hundred times the drive for food when you're hungry.
[01:56:13.019 --> 01:56:20.944]  It is the drive for humanity to be good and to build and to be decent and to stand against corrupt scum and to not be a slave.
[01:56:20.944 --> 01:56:22.245]  It is totally
[01:56:25.182 --> 01:56:26.182]  Fulfilling.
[01:56:26.182 --> 01:56:28.903]  It is all-encompassing.
[01:56:28.903 --> 01:56:30.724]  And that's where I stand.
[01:56:30.724 --> 01:56:43.368]  And when you stand in that, and when you stand in the presence of God's Spirit, then it makes you feel very humble and empowered, but also at the same time very, very weak and dirty and bad.
[01:56:43.368 --> 01:56:46.049]  Like dirty rags, as the Bible describes.
[01:56:49.353 --> 01:56:54.356]  Folks that were close to God, they felt like they had dirty rags because you realize how bad you are.
[01:56:54.356 --> 01:56:56.297]  And you don't like that part of you as well.
[01:56:56.297 --> 01:57:03.101]  And you see other people that are into their evil, and then you figure out they don't like you because you're not committed to all the things they do.
[01:57:03.101 --> 01:57:04.742]  They like it!
[01:57:04.742 --> 01:57:06.563]  Stench smells good to them.
[01:57:06.563 --> 01:57:08.885]  Children in pain is fun for them.
[01:57:08.885 --> 01:57:11.266]  And all I want to do is club their brains out.
[01:57:11.266 --> 01:57:12.887]  And not because I like to club brains out.
[01:57:12.887 --> 01:57:13.708]  It's a compulsion!
[01:57:13.708 --> 01:57:16.069]  I want to get my hands around their throat!
[01:57:16.069 --> 01:57:17.310]  You know what I'm talking about!
[01:57:18.257 --> 01:57:21.700]  We're the people that are strong, and we need to start acting like it!
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:25.263]  And stop being weak, and letting a bunch of scum run our lives!
[01:57:25.263 --> 01:57:26.744]  Evil is weak!
[01:57:26.744 --> 01:57:31.568]  But good likes to stand back and let it run things, and that has to stop.
[01:57:31.568 --> 01:57:33.930]  I'm gonna come back, take some calls, and we're gonna get David Naughton here.
[01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:35.192]  We'll get David Naughton at the bottom of the hours.
[01:57:35.192 --> 01:57:36.032]  I wanna continue with the calls.
[01:57:36.032 --> 01:57:37.273]  I haven't been good about getting to him yet.
[01:57:37.273 --> 01:57:37.534]  I will.
[01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:39.384]  I've done pretty good.
[01:57:39.384 --> 01:57:41.005]  Been pretty heavy callers today.
[01:57:41.005 --> 01:57:44.567]  Again, we finance this by promoting products we think are the best that we've researched.
[01:57:44.567 --> 01:57:46.487]  And there's a bunch of new products in.
[01:57:46.487 --> 01:57:47.328]  Two years in the making.
[01:57:47.328 --> 01:57:48.688]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[01:57:48.688 --> 01:57:51.550]  Certified non-GMO pesticide-free whole food.

[01:57:52.110 --> 01:57:53.931]  Hundreds of incredible ingredients.
[01:57:53.931 --> 01:57:59.533]  Nobody else has hundreds of ingredients that is able to have it non-GMO, certified, organic.
[01:57:59.533 --> 01:58:00.834]  Because it's just so hard to do.
[01:58:00.834 --> 01:58:01.334]  But they did it.
[01:58:01.934 --> 01:58:14.606]  And it's available along with all the other incredible products at InfoWarsHealth.com or by calling 888-789-9277 if you want to call and get the help signing up for AutoShip to get free shipping or you can sign up and be a distributor for $10 and get discounts.

[01:59:29.347 --> 01:59:40.249]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:59:59.068 --> 02:00:01.831]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:08.427 --> 02:00:13.252]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:13.252 --> 02:00:14.854]  You want answers?
[02:00:14.854 --> 02:00:16.396]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:16.396 --> 02:00:20.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:24.644]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.682 --> 02:00:35.964]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've been following this.
[02:00:35.964 --> 02:00:43.590]  Adam Kokesh has been calling me, the famous libertarian talk show host who's going to have the armed march on Washington.
[02:00:43.590 --> 02:00:49.394]  He has now officially said, and I've talked to him over the phone, I should have made a bigger deal out of this, but I kept thinking he was going to get out.
[02:00:49.394 --> 02:00:58.240]  Then we heard last week that they'd take him to an undisclosed location, talking to his crew, and now they've denounced no bond for Adam Kokesh.
[02:00:59.267 --> 02:01:04.170]  And when I talked to Adam multiple times, they would cut him off the phone.
[02:01:04.170 --> 02:01:05.211]  He has my cell phone number.
[02:01:05.211 --> 02:01:09.793]  He called me from prison, let's not exaggerate, 20 times, and they cut him off.
[02:01:09.793 --> 02:01:11.835]  And then I started getting messages.
[02:01:11.835 --> 02:01:15.177]  Then we even tried to hook it up off my cell phone to record it, and then he couldn't get back through.
[02:01:16.992 --> 02:01:20.474]  Adam Kokesh would call in and he would call me and say, they planted it!
[02:01:20.474 --> 02:01:20.994]  They planted it!
[02:01:20.994 --> 02:01:24.715]  I didn't have drugs, so officially he's saying they planted it.
[02:01:24.715 --> 02:01:31.318]  And he's the type of guy, if he knew he was going to get raided, why would he have, even if he did have mushrooms there, why would he have it?
[02:01:31.318 --> 02:01:33.559]  And so, we'll try to get an update on that.
[02:01:33.559 --> 02:01:35.960]  I mean, he's the type of guy that would say if he did.
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:38.241]  And he knew they were going to be coming, why would he do that?
[02:01:38.241 --> 02:01:39.802]  So they set him up.
[02:01:39.802 --> 02:01:45.004]  And it shows you folks, a lot of people thought Adam Kokesh was like a PSYOP or something.
[02:01:45.004 --> 02:01:45.765]  No, I don't think so.
[02:01:46.696 --> 02:01:56.080]  I think he's pretty wound up from all the stuff he saw in Fallujah as a Marine, and he's kind of gotten really reckless and wild.
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:00.462]  I can only admire his courage, but my gut tells me he's not some agent.
[02:02:00.462 --> 02:02:02.803]  My gut tells me he's in deep, deep, deep trouble.
[02:02:04.445 --> 02:02:04.785]  I don't know.
[02:02:28.314 --> 02:02:29.276]  The A.D.C.
[02:02:29.276 --> 02:02:34.003]  Superior Court Judge has ordered a veteran and activist accused of openly carrying a shotgun in D.C.'
[02:02:33.983 --> 02:02:35.845]  's Freedom Plaza held without bond.
[02:02:35.845 --> 02:02:37.327]  So that law has been overturned there!
[02:02:38.547 --> 02:02:44.010]  For five years, right at five years, and it'll be about a month, it'll be five years, and they don't care.
[02:02:44.010 --> 02:02:47.332]  You have a shotgun in D.C., they're gonna hold you without bond.
[02:02:47.332 --> 02:02:48.812]  So he's a political prisoner.
[02:02:48.812 --> 02:02:56.236]  During a preliminary hearing Monday, an attorney representing Adam Kokesh argued that the stunt filmed and posted on YouTube was nothing more than political theater.
[02:02:56.236 --> 02:02:59.358]  The judge disagreed, ordering Kokesh be held until his next court appearance.
[02:02:59.358 --> 02:03:01.539]  I consider your client to be a very dangerous man, the judge said.
[02:03:01.539 --> 02:03:03.600]  This is not a political statement.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:04.921]  It's a totally political statement.
[02:03:04.921 --> 02:03:06.381]  Wow.
[02:03:06.381 --> 02:03:07.542]  Wow, folks.
[02:03:09.312 --> 02:03:20.076]  When tyrants prevail, the best men rot in filthy jails, while those that cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[02:03:20.076 --> 02:03:31.260]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, while those that cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:32.980]  I consider your client to be a very dangerous man.
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:34.381]  I consider this judge to be a very dangerous
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:36.821]  Pig Demon.
[02:03:36.821 --> 02:03:39.884]  The judge said this is not a political statement.
[02:03:39.884 --> 02:03:41.825]  Well, I guess you thank God you're God.
[02:03:41.825 --> 02:03:47.070]  Kokesh has been arrested and charged with drug-related offenses in Fairfax County, Virginia earlier in July.
[02:03:47.070 --> 02:03:48.851]  He's expected to be back in D.C.
[02:03:48.851 --> 02:03:50.132]  courtroom August 13th.
[02:03:50.132 --> 02:03:54.015]  So they hauled him out of Virginia last Thursday.
[02:03:54.015 --> 02:03:54.636]  He disappeared.
[02:03:54.636 --> 02:03:56.758]  They wouldn't tell anybody where he was for days.
[02:03:56.758 --> 02:03:58.119]  And now they've hauled him up.
[02:03:59.464 --> 02:04:00.405]  Unbelievable!
[02:04:00.405 --> 02:04:03.146]  So that's up on DrudgeReport.com, red-linked.
[02:04:03.146 --> 02:04:07.809]  And for posterity, we'll get it up on InfoWars to mirror it as well with our videos with Kokesh.
[02:04:07.809 --> 02:04:10.770]  So please tell the crew, I know they're listening anyways.
[02:04:10.770 --> 02:04:14.832]  Okay, we'll go to break and come back and take some of your phone calls.
[02:04:14.832 --> 02:04:20.015]  There's news breaks here today.

[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:19.690]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:41.616 --> 02:08:50.459]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to go back to your phone calls and more news, but right now, I want to just recap what broke during the last segment.
[02:08:50.459 --> 02:09:05.465]  Adam Kokesh, the Libertarian Talk Show host, frequent guest on this show, he got arrested a few weeks ago in a huge SWAT team raid in Maryland.
[02:09:05.465 --> 02:09:07.006]  And I've since talked to him from
[02:09:08.994 --> 02:09:15.776]  A state jail in Virginia, but he's been transferred to the feds now, even though it was the feds that arrested him.
[02:09:15.776 --> 02:09:22.178]  And what happened to him, he says, is that they planted the mushrooms on him.
[02:09:22.178 --> 02:09:28.380]  I mean, he said they were going to be rating me over having to load a shotgun in DC as a demonstration.
[02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:31.001]  So why would I have mushrooms there?
[02:09:31.001 --> 02:09:33.362]  And he said they brought in big bags full of stuff.
[02:09:34.449 --> 02:09:36.190]  And it was just bizarre.
[02:09:36.190 --> 02:09:37.310]  And there's a bunch of witnesses.
[02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:39.691]  I've had lawyers that were there waiting for the raid.
[02:09:39.691 --> 02:09:44.333]  They've been camping out there for weeks when it happened, expecting them to try something.
[02:09:44.333 --> 02:09:48.034]  And they said they saw them bring in big paper bags full of stuff.
[02:09:48.034 --> 02:09:49.594]  And it sure wasn't their lunch.
[02:09:49.594 --> 02:09:51.835]  And they searched the place for over four hours.
[02:09:51.835 --> 02:09:54.596]  They said they found marijuana and mushrooms.
[02:09:54.596 --> 02:09:57.537]  And now they've announced he's being held without bail.
[02:09:57.537 --> 02:09:59.178]  The feds are for
[02:10:00.768 --> 02:10:16.537]  being a quote very dangerous man and that it was not a political statement even though his lawyer argued that he said it's a political statement and so now he has disappeared uh... into the federal uh... rattle and the superior court judge has ordered
[02:10:18.089 --> 02:10:23.271]  A veteran and activist accused of open carrying a shotgun in DC's Freedom Plaza held without bond.
[02:10:23.271 --> 02:10:31.053]  During a preliminary hearing today, an attorney representing Adam Kokesh argued that the stunt, filmed and posted on YouTube, was nothing more than political theater.
[02:10:31.053 --> 02:10:35.535]  The judge disagreed, ordering that Kokesh be held until next court appearance.
[02:10:35.535 --> 02:10:38.616]  I consider your client to be a very dangerous man, the judge added.
[02:10:38.616 --> 02:10:40.997]  This is not a political statement, because she's God, she can say that.
[02:10:43.223 --> 02:10:45.726]  And it goes on that he's next expected to be seen in a D.C.
[02:10:45.726 --> 02:10:47.128]  courtroom August 13th.
[02:10:47.128 --> 02:10:55.317]  So in America, a guy with no criminal record other than being arrested for dancing at the Jefferson Monument, that's not allowed.
[02:10:55.317 --> 02:10:57.199]  Well, they treat you like scum in D.C.
[02:10:57.199 --> 02:10:59.281]  Family's filming on the side of the sidewalk.
[02:10:59.281 --> 02:11:00.182]  You can't do that!
[02:11:00.182 --> 02:11:01.023]  What's the law?
[02:11:01.023 --> 02:11:01.464]  I told you!
[02:11:01.464 --> 02:11:03.085]  I mean, they want you to know you're scum.
[02:11:04.282 --> 02:11:06.544]  I mean, North Korea isn't that rude to people.
[02:11:06.544 --> 02:11:07.764]  I mean, it's pathetic.
[02:11:07.764 --> 02:11:15.049]  I've been there many times with film crews, you name it, and thought they were singling us out until I'd be... I've told the story many times.
[02:11:15.049 --> 02:11:21.373]  We got it on tape somewhere around 100 yards, 200 yards from the Washington Monument.
[02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:22.994]  And at first, cops come over and go, you can't film here.
[02:11:22.994 --> 02:11:25.155]  And you're like, we're with a film crew.
[02:11:25.155 --> 02:11:25.555]  We checked.
[02:11:25.555 --> 02:11:26.916]  They don't give permits in D.C.
[02:11:26.916 --> 02:11:28.577]  Plus, you don't need a permit.
[02:11:28.577 --> 02:11:29.218]  We're just here.
[02:11:29.218 --> 02:11:29.478]  And they go,
[02:11:31.604 --> 02:11:33.986]  Alright, I'll let you do it for five minutes.
[02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:35.727]  And you're like, but there's no law.
[02:11:35.727 --> 02:11:38.729]  And he goes, I can do whatever I want, a police officer's order.
[02:11:38.729 --> 02:11:44.833]  And you're like, so they walk off, and then security guards come over.
[02:11:44.833 --> 02:11:51.398]  And we're way back from, you know, the ring of flags around it, down the hill.
[02:11:51.398 --> 02:11:54.560]  I was with C-Think one of the times that made the New World Order film.
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:56.401]  They just had handheld cameras.
[02:11:56.401 --> 02:12:00.164]  They come over and the security guard goes, I don't care what the cops told you, I'll have you arrested.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:12.248]  And then you try to go, even in the park, across the street, I'm talking 200 yards from the White House gate, and Secret Service on bikes come over, but in uniforms, and go, get out of here, you can't film!
[02:12:12.248 --> 02:12:14.170]  And you're like, it's America!
[02:12:14.170 --> 02:12:16.852]  And they're like, hey!
[02:12:16.852 --> 02:12:27.981]  And you're like... And then, they move on, and then they go to a family, and the family's like, and they're getting off on it, there's like a family and little kids,
[02:12:28.976 --> 02:12:32.021]  I mean, they want you to know, this country's ours!
[02:12:32.021 --> 02:12:33.984]  And there ain't nothing you're doing!
[02:12:33.984 --> 02:12:36.728]  We're gonna gut it, up one side and down the other!
[02:12:36.728 --> 02:12:40.434]  I mean, this is like Mao Zedong runs this country or something.
[02:12:41.857 --> 02:12:54.846]  And you see him trying to charge people with life in prison in Illinois for filming the police, because they're hauling off cars from their junkyard that they've owned for 50-something years, and they've got classic cars worth massive amounts of money.
[02:12:54.846 --> 02:13:04.232]  And then when the judge finally said, I'm going to throw this out of court, they sent the state down with a special amicus brief saying, we want this guy indicted.
[02:13:04.232 --> 02:13:06.774]  We want people in jail for life for filming.
[02:13:10.959 --> 02:13:16.442]  For life, you get a lot, I mean, folks, this is just North Korea if they have their way.
[02:13:16.442 --> 02:13:29.129]  And it makes me physically... It is absolutely incredible.
[02:13:29.129 --> 02:13:32.711]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:13:32.711 --> 02:13:36.793]  That this type of stuff's going on, that a slave, with a shotgun,
[02:13:39.289 --> 02:13:44.573]  Loading it and saying, I'm not a slave, Rosa Parks sitting at the front of the bus, I'm not sitting at the back of the bus.
[02:13:44.573 --> 02:13:54.220]  That that so freaked out the system.
[02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:58.403]  That so freaked out the system.
[02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:02.201]  That they're holding him without bond.
[02:14:02.201 --> 02:14:05.023]  It just shows the incredible tyrants these people are.
[02:14:05.023 --> 02:14:08.005]  Because the ultimate crime is a slave that's armed.
[02:14:08.005 --> 02:14:09.906]  Brandon in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:14:09.906 --> 02:14:13.129]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:14:13.129 --> 02:14:14.890]  Thanks for calling, brother.
[02:14:14.890 --> 02:14:15.410]  Hey, no problem.
[02:14:15.410 --> 02:14:21.854]  Actually, I was going to talk about eugenics, but I had another point, too, since you started talking about people getting arrested so easily.
[02:14:21.854 --> 02:14:29.780]  I live and have a job that's right in the heart of the city, and I don't know if this is a pattern around with other major cities or not, and I won't mention any names,
[02:14:30.458 --> 02:14:38.101]  But we've got, um, we've got a judge here in town who profits off of these low-level dealers and has a male prostitution ring.
[02:14:38.101 --> 02:14:39.581]  This is not speculation.
[02:14:39.581 --> 02:14:42.262]  This is not, for instance, fact.
[02:14:42.262 --> 02:14:50.525]  And, uh, so a lot of the beat cops have kind of evolved to where when they bust somebody, they always say, look, we've got to find a felony here.
[02:14:50.525 --> 02:14:54.106]  Because if we don't, these guys are going to get right back down and start making a profit for this judge.
[02:14:55.115 --> 02:15:03.842]  Have you noticed a pattern like this where some of the higher-ups are making a profit off of crime like this in some of the bigger cities?
[02:15:03.842 --> 02:15:04.743]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:15:04.743 --> 02:15:20.374]  You've either got cities that have resisted criminal takeover and or have kicked criminal governments out before, and I'd say that's maybe a third of the cities and towns, a rough estimation, depends on the region, that aren't mafia-run.
[02:15:20.374 --> 02:15:23.417]  And those are generally nice places where everybody wants to move and they're prosperous.
[02:15:24.531 --> 02:15:30.955]  But you also have areas where the criminals have taken over, where it's already such a big town or city that they just feel everybody.
[02:15:30.955 --> 02:15:39.401]  But then they usually go so far, they get caught because, you know, their son gets caught with a kilo of cocaine and kills somebody, and then it all comes out.
[02:15:39.401 --> 02:15:45.085]  And so that police chief or that mayor steps down so that it kind of goes away, but the dealing starts.
[02:15:45.085 --> 02:15:49.108]  I mean, where I live in Texas, about half the sheriffs
[02:15:50.515 --> 02:15:55.320]  In the counties, on average, about half the counties have had sheriffs arrested running drugs, running prostitutes.
[02:15:58.735 --> 02:16:03.599]  They're also caught running pedophile rings all the time, but that doesn't mean that all the sheriffs are pedophiles.
[02:16:03.599 --> 02:16:09.064]  You'll have a sheriff right next door that's so simple-minded and gullible that they don't even know what's happening.
[02:16:09.064 --> 02:16:15.049]  But yes, normally it's the police that run the hooker operations in big cities.
[02:16:15.049 --> 02:16:21.354]  LA, New York, big cities, the police as middlemen for the big banks.
[02:16:21.354 --> 02:16:23.636]  The big banks ship the drugs in, all of it.
[02:16:24.659 --> 02:16:31.686]  And then the law to the money and then any drugs that are shipped in that they don't control they send the police at to go shut down their competition.
[02:16:31.686 --> 02:16:37.393]  And of course the beat cops are out just writing tickets and raising money or responding to burglar alarms.
[02:16:37.393 --> 02:16:43.479]  But it's the special narcotics units and you know it's always the prostitution unit that turns out is running the horse.
[02:16:43.479 --> 02:16:44.840]  Because they want to also you know
[02:16:46.021 --> 02:16:48.802]  Take a bite out of the prostitutes, like a bite out of crime.
[02:16:48.802 --> 02:16:51.304]  They want to dabble in that.
[02:16:51.304 --> 02:16:58.588]  And all the runaways and 16-year-olds coming off the buses and all of it.
[02:16:58.588 --> 02:17:08.053]  A lot of these narcotics detectives, they've got a busy day having sex five, six times and snorting cocaine themselves and injecting heroin and beating people up.
[02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:08.453]  You see them.
[02:17:08.453 --> 02:17:09.593]  They're just hardcore criminals.
[02:17:09.593 --> 02:17:10.234]  They run America.
[02:17:11.207 --> 02:17:23.728]  and uh... that's that's how it is and uh... you know they've got your daughter right now you know you know you know hotel and the man in the hotel gives them free hotel rooms to consider they don't know they'll take the hotel for drug dealing
[02:17:24.858 --> 02:17:26.800]  I mean, that's how this works.
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:38.771]  And so, yeah, I suggest, you can probably get killed doing it, but if you want to fight them, go in with a wire, go into bars, get people talking about it, talk to the hookers, do your own citizen sting.
[02:17:38.771 --> 02:17:39.852]  I'm not recommending you do this.
[02:17:39.852 --> 02:17:42.214]  You can get killed doing this, but this is the kind of thing I would do.
[02:17:42.214 --> 02:17:46.758]  You would go, get the hooker in there, don't have sex with her, get it all recorded, who she works for.
[02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:48.520]  Don't do it, just put it directly up to YouTube.
[02:17:49.431 --> 02:17:53.717]  Just directly up with a report, who did it, who they are, it'll destroy them.
[02:17:53.717 --> 02:17:55.860]  By the time it gets copied, put everywhere, it's over.
[02:17:55.860 --> 02:17:57.282]  You just burn them down that way.
[02:17:57.282 --> 02:17:59.204]  I call it burning them down.
[02:17:59.204 --> 02:18:04.592]  And, uh, or you can go into their office and say, Hey, I've got all the interviews with the hookers and the stuff you're running.
[02:18:04.592 --> 02:18:05.833]  What are you going to do about that?
[02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:08.821]  What are you going to do about that?
[02:18:08.821 --> 02:18:11.261]  And then they'll offer to buy you off or threaten you.
[02:18:11.261 --> 02:18:14.902]  You'll go, oh, I already have it all ready in another city ready to be uploaded.
[02:18:14.902 --> 02:18:16.983]  Then they'll start trying to offer to buy you out.
[02:18:16.983 --> 02:18:18.803]  The FBI is not going to help you generally.
[02:18:18.803 --> 02:18:19.983]  They're on the take.
[02:18:19.983 --> 02:18:22.004]  So all you can do is publicly burn them down.
[02:18:22.004 --> 02:18:24.365]  Then say, all right, well, you know, they'll offer you a bribe.
[02:18:24.365 --> 02:18:25.405]  You say, all right, we'll talk about it.
[02:18:26.394 --> 02:18:34.778]  They may still flip out and have the cops kill you as you drive away from the police station or the city council building, you know, the mayor's office.
[02:18:34.778 --> 02:18:36.019]  So you better have people with you.
[02:18:36.019 --> 02:18:37.300]  I'm telling you, it's dangerous.
[02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:39.161]  I mean, they may just still kill you anyways.
[02:18:39.161 --> 02:18:41.082]  And who cares if it gets uploaded?
[02:18:41.082 --> 02:18:45.124]  And then you just upload the fact that they're running the whores locally.
[02:18:45.124 --> 02:18:48.186]  And it will usually be underage ones, too, because things are so corrupt now.
[02:18:48.186 --> 02:18:50.767]  Most of these people don't want a 25-year-old prostitute.
[02:18:50.767 --> 02:18:51.948]  They want a 15-year-old one.
[02:18:52.988 --> 02:18:59.011]  Uh, and so, I mean, that's why you can walk into Acorn offices and those famous videos, office after office, going, here's my underage hooker.
[02:18:59.011 --> 02:18:59.891]  I'm gonna bring in little kids.
[02:18:59.891 --> 02:19:01.572]  They're like, well, let us, let us sign you up.
[02:19:01.572 --> 02:19:03.192]  Oh yeah, we love that.
[02:19:03.192 --> 02:19:04.293]  I mean, that's just America.
[02:19:04.293 --> 02:19:05.333]  That's what America is.
[02:19:05.333 --> 02:19:11.856]  You got one half is pure evil and the other half doesn't know what side of the planet they're on and doesn't know their, you know, head from a hole in the ground.
[02:19:11.856 --> 02:19:13.577]  And that's an overgeneralization.
[02:19:13.577 --> 02:19:16.058]  When I say one half of either the awake
[02:19:16.858 --> 02:19:23.882]  Of the group doing nothing, half of them are evil and know what's going on, and the other half are so stupid and so naive that they don't care.
[02:19:23.882 --> 02:19:28.484]  And then you've probably got 35-40% of the population that's awake.
[02:19:28.484 --> 02:19:42.752]  So you've got like 70% that's either totally dumb or in on the evil, and 30% or so that are good and awake, but either aren't taking action because they feel powerless, or are caught up in infighting and cognitive infiltration.
[02:19:42.752 --> 02:19:44.393]  So, I mean, does that answer your question, sir?
[02:19:45.546 --> 02:19:46.046]  It does.
[02:19:46.046 --> 02:19:46.686]  I hear the music.
[02:19:46.686 --> 02:19:48.207]  Do I have time to ask a quick question?
[02:19:48.207 --> 02:19:48.767]  Sure, sure, sure.
[02:19:48.767 --> 02:19:55.230]  We'll come back to you and then we'll get to Julio and Aaron and then first Chris in Kentucky and then Gabriel.
[02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:57.210]  But we're coming to Chris after Brandon and Julio.
[02:19:57.210 --> 02:19:57.691]  Stay with us.
[02:19:57.691 --> 02:19:58.791]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:20:04.312 --> 02:20:05.872]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:20:05.872 --> 02:20:11.954]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[02:20:11.954 --> 02:20:20.155]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[02:20:20.155 --> 02:20:25.816]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.
[02:20:25.816 --> 02:20:28.017]  The E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[02:20:28.337 --> 02:20:38.384]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[02:21:03.659 --> 02:21:06.021]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[02:21:06.021 --> 02:21:12.624]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them, if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[02:21:12.624 --> 02:21:20.629]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:21:21.149 --> 02:21:25.930]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:21:25.930 --> 02:21:30.071]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:21:30.071 --> 02:21:38.193]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids, and all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[02:21:38.193 --> 02:21:41.694]  With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Way.
[02:21:42.094 --> 02:21:43.115]  My name is Daniel.
[02:21:43.115 --> 02:21:44.335]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:21:44.335 --> 02:21:48.237]  When I started using One World Way, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:21:48.237 --> 02:21:51.999]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:21:51.999 --> 02:21:53.280]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:22:00.204]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:22:00.204 --> 02:22:03.385]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:22:03.385 --> 02:22:08.148]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:22:08.148 --> 02:22:10.249]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:22:11.162 --> 02:22:20.125]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House, at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:22:20.125 --> 02:22:25.047]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:22:25.683 --> 02:22:37.053]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:22:37.053 --> 02:22:44.060]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:49.025]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[02:22:49.025 --> 02:22:52.629]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:22:52.629 --> 02:22:53.650]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[02:22:53.650 --> 02:22:59.897]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:22:59.897 --> 02:23:01.179]  Protect your immune system.
[02:23:01.179 --> 02:23:02.220]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:23:02.680 --> 02:23:06.922]  When you need it the most, will your generator power equipment or vehicle be ready?
[02:23:06.922 --> 02:23:14.325]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored, and more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[02:23:14.325 --> 02:23:18.426]  PRI Fuel Stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[02:23:18.426 --> 02:23:24.509]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at sea rely on PRI Fuel Stabilizers.
[02:23:24.509 --> 02:23:25.169]  And you can too!
[02:23:25.169 --> 02:23:27.130]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit priproducts.com to find the dealer nearest to you.
[02:23:34.147 --> 02:23:37.289]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[02:23:37.289 --> 02:23:38.669]  But what about the seventh?
[02:23:38.669 --> 02:23:42.931]  Unlike Ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[02:23:42.931 --> 02:23:44.472]  And it just won't quit.
[02:23:44.472 --> 02:23:51.175]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prepper, Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[02:23:51.175 --> 02:23:53.337]  That means safety and peace of mind.
[02:23:53.337 --> 02:23:55.778]  Buy yours at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:23:55.778 --> 02:23:59.780]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:01.240]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:02.061]  Just won't quit.
[02:24:08.669 --> 02:24:13.370]  They mark in lines and carry signs, protesters one and all.
[02:24:13.370 --> 02:24:19.272]  They'd rather go to prison than to heed their country's call.
[02:24:19.272 --> 02:24:24.073]  Get out of here, get out of there, let's have an end to war.
[02:24:24.073 --> 02:24:29.914]  I'm glad they weren't around to say, get out of Valley Forge.
[02:24:29.914 --> 02:24:33.215]  The minute men are turning in their graves,
[02:24:34.907 --> 02:24:52.117]  Washington and Jefferson are crying tears of shame To see these men who'd rather live as slaves The men and men are turning in their graves What's happened to our heritage?
[02:24:52.117 --> 02:24:54.438]  What's happened to our pride?
[02:24:54.438 --> 02:24:58.881]  Since when the free Americans pulled for the other side?
[02:25:00.370 --> 02:25:04.677]  Did we send food to Hitler's troops, our praise the enemy?
[02:25:04.677 --> 02:25:08.763]  Did all our children die in vain defending liberty?
[02:25:11.107 --> 02:25:13.008]  That's Stonewall Jackson.
[02:25:13.008 --> 02:25:26.756]  I see a lot of people back in the 50s and 60s, they would say, do whatever the government says in a war, that's fighting for America.
[02:25:26.756 --> 02:25:29.658]  They didn't know that that was a PSYOP as well.
[02:25:42.967 --> 02:25:43.687]  Well, they've taken over.
[02:26:01.607 --> 02:26:03.308]  So see, that's also the PSYOP.
[02:26:03.308 --> 02:26:05.849]  The globalists create the war.
[02:26:05.849 --> 02:26:21.957]  They then create the opposition to the war as the new political class who they actually put in who become even bigger warmongers and who then wage war against America itself.
[02:26:21.957 --> 02:26:27.740]  And so what's happening is the people at the Pentagon now really are coming to face to face that they're the bad guys.
[02:26:29.656 --> 02:26:44.751]  I saw a skit, I forget what it was on, it was one of the comedy shows on TV, but I saw the clip on YouTube, and it shows German soldiers on the Eastern Front, and they're going, you know, we're wearing black uniforms and skulls on our hats.
[02:26:44.751 --> 02:26:46.913]  That's what the bad guys wear.
[02:26:46.913 --> 02:26:50.356]  You know, I would think like guys in black wearing skulls, that's like the bad guys.
[02:26:50.356 --> 02:26:53.960]  That guy goes, you know, you are actually right, that is kind of how the bad guys dress.
[02:26:54.514 --> 02:26:56.576]  I mean, now look at even how the new old order acts.
[02:26:56.576 --> 02:26:57.757]  They are the bad guy.
[02:26:57.757 --> 02:26:59.979]  The country's a homeland.
[02:26:59.979 --> 02:27:03.542]  Homeland is there to absorb the old republic.
[02:27:03.542 --> 02:27:07.225]  Homeland is a fascist or communist term.
[02:27:09.273 --> 02:27:16.558]  It's just, they're even going with the archetypal script to try to condition us to just accept anything they want to do.
[02:27:16.558 --> 02:27:18.119]  The military people aren't bad.
[02:27:18.119 --> 02:27:20.280]  On average, they're some of the most awake folks.
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:21.561]  It's the people running it.
[02:27:21.561 --> 02:27:23.642]  I know I beat that horse to death, folks.
[02:27:23.642 --> 02:27:26.344]  Let's go to the fellow I was talking to.
[02:27:26.344 --> 02:27:28.425]  Was that Brandon in Georgia?
[02:27:28.425 --> 02:27:30.466]  Yeah, Brandon, look, I don't know about your town.
[02:27:30.466 --> 02:27:33.068]  I don't know about what your mayors and people are up to.
[02:27:33.068 --> 02:27:33.868]  I don't know their names.
[02:27:33.868 --> 02:27:34.789]  I don't want to hear them.
[02:27:34.789 --> 02:27:37.090]  I don't want to have unsubstantiated stuff on air.
[02:27:37.090 --> 02:27:37.851]  I just know this.
[02:27:40.622 --> 02:27:49.126]  I would say more than half the cities and counties and county seats are criminal operations.
[02:27:49.126 --> 02:27:56.250]  I mean, you'll have a lot of people working compartmentalized who aren't aware of it, but generally, yes.
[02:27:56.250 --> 02:28:00.552]  And there's another reason they've had the Pentagon come in and federalize local departments and things.
[02:28:01.775 --> 02:28:05.437]  Because that's so the government can control that centrally as well.
[02:28:05.437 --> 02:28:11.901]  And that's why our government seems so mafioso, is because it is run by big banks that are the ultimate mafia.
[02:28:11.901 --> 02:28:16.523]  And so, this is government by corporate mafias that are above the law.
[02:28:16.523 --> 02:28:18.684]  What was your last question?
[02:28:18.684 --> 02:28:26.989]  It was concerning eugenics, and maybe you can enlighten me, maybe there's a better word for what I'm about to talk about, but I'll preface it with, I'm totally against abortion.
[02:28:27.871 --> 02:28:30.793]  I think it's a moot point as far as whether or not consciousness is there.
[02:28:30.793 --> 02:28:33.314]  The fact that we don't know should suspend all abortion.
[02:28:33.314 --> 02:28:36.336]  Well now they're saying kill babies up to age 3!
[02:28:36.336 --> 02:28:37.316]  I hear this.
[02:28:37.316 --> 02:28:46.901]  Now they're saying old people don't have a good life, even if they're conscious and awake, and the bioethics board decides to kill you because they decide your life's not worth living.
[02:28:46.901 --> 02:28:47.762]  That's all they're doing!
[02:28:55.779 --> 02:28:58.340]  Yeah, which means killing a three-month-old baby, yeah.
[02:28:58.340 --> 02:28:59.301]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:28:59.301 --> 02:29:11.488]  But as far as eugenics goes, you know, when I see things, and I see people that have been convicted over and over for child abuse, pedophilia, these types of things, I mean, do you not think... Why not sterilize them?
[02:29:11.488 --> 02:29:12.148]  Exactly.
[02:29:12.148 --> 02:29:15.390]  Yeah, but see, that's the road to hell's paved with good intentions.
[02:29:15.390 --> 02:29:20.433]  Because the minute you start doing that, you should just execute them rather than do that.
[02:29:20.433 --> 02:29:23.735]  Because let me tell you, it's going to start being used against everybody.
[02:29:24.557 --> 02:29:31.682]  They don't want some kid in a crib that's 5 and weighs 25 pounds with maggots all over him.
[02:29:31.682 --> 02:29:39.067]  They want your healthy, happy kid that's living great to hand it off to a rich family because they want to do satanic rituals with it.
[02:29:39.067 --> 02:29:42.630]  Let me tell you, a lot of your CPS are outright devil worshippers.
[02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.830]  Okay?
[02:29:42.830 --> 02:29:43.490]  I've dealt with them.
[02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:44.911]  They worship Satan.
[02:29:44.911 --> 02:29:46.592]  They want to rape your kid.
[02:29:46.592 --> 02:29:47.513]  Okay?
[02:29:47.513 --> 02:29:48.374]  Period.
[02:29:48.374 --> 02:29:49.474]  Just face it.
[02:29:49.474 --> 02:29:50.155]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:53.291 --> 02:29:57.219]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:57.219 --> 02:29:59.884]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:03.325 --> 02:32:08.046]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?

[02:32:11.167 --> 02:32:16.729]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease.
[02:32:16.729 --> 02:32:18.330]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:32:18.650 --> 02:32:20.291]  We are what we eat.
[02:32:20.291 --> 02:32:24.954]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:32:24.954 --> 02:32:29.177]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:32:29.177 --> 02:32:31.739]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[02:33:17.896 --> 02:33:19.778]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.763 --> 02:33:34.345]  Alright, folks, I have been ranting and raving today.
[02:33:34.345 --> 02:33:48.352]  I've absolutely got to get to some of the financial news and Middle East news, some of the other stuff that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but I wanted to get into the Paul Revere contest, and it's been a huge success with David Knight.
[02:33:48.352 --> 02:33:54.115]  But first, David, I've got to ask you, and I think I'll do this tomorrow with listeners, a specific question to listeners.
[02:33:55.576 --> 02:34:06.487]  What do they think of the Pentagon coming out in a major deputy secretary of defense, head of public relations, DOD, saying, we've been lying to the public a lot, we've been caught.
[02:34:06.487 --> 02:34:07.247]  These are quotes.
[02:34:07.247 --> 02:34:09.630]  We're going to stop now.
[02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:11.191]  And everybody's freaking out.
[02:34:11.191 --> 02:34:12.292]  People have tears in their eyes.
[02:34:12.292 --> 02:34:15.596]  If you watch the video, the body language, people get up and say, I don't want to lie.
[02:34:15.596 --> 02:34:16.817]  I hope this is the truth.
[02:34:16.817 --> 02:34:18.439]  I mean, this this was not a PSYOP.
[02:34:19.399 --> 02:34:23.401]  They may have authorized it because it's some psyop to say, we're going to tell the truth, don't trust us.
[02:34:23.401 --> 02:34:27.802]  But I know the people that are really revolting are in the Pentagon.
[02:34:27.802 --> 02:34:29.663]  They know that they're experts in this.
[02:34:29.663 --> 02:34:31.343]  They know this is authoritarianism.
[02:34:31.343 --> 02:34:33.644]  Everything they were trained to fight just 50 years ago.
[02:34:33.644 --> 02:34:34.785]  They're like, wow.
[02:34:34.785 --> 02:34:43.748]  So I see it as a huge moment where there's a debate going on and almost the system begging, you know, for people to
[02:34:44.648 --> 02:34:47.050]  Well, at the same time they're doing that, they've also got
[02:35:01.601 --> 02:35:08.408]  People talking about how they're repealing a prohibition that's been in place since after World War II, all through the Cold War.
[02:35:08.408 --> 02:35:16.557]  They're repealing a prohibition against broadcasting propaganda-type news domestically in the United States, like with Radio Free Europe and that sort of thing, Voice of America.
[02:35:17.117 --> 02:35:18.699]  They're repealing that at the same time.
[02:35:18.699 --> 02:35:21.061]  So they're stepping up the info war in both directions.
[02:35:21.061 --> 02:35:25.465]  So you've got people that are good on the inside, that are aware of what's going on, and are pushing back on it.
[02:35:25.465 --> 02:35:34.353]  But then you've also got government working to actively propagandize internally in the United States, just like they're bringing home the militarization, you know, and what they've been doing.
[02:35:35.334 --> 02:35:36.556]  In various foreign cities.
[02:35:36.556 --> 02:35:36.876]  That's right.
[02:35:36.876 --> 02:35:39.699]  They've helped set up the New World Order and now it's collapsing.
[02:35:39.699 --> 02:35:40.419]  I agree.
[02:35:40.419 --> 02:35:44.143]  And this is a psy-op on those people to allow them to do that.
[02:35:44.143 --> 02:35:45.345]  It's like, we're the good guys.
[02:35:45.345 --> 02:35:48.568]  We're going to stop lying now that it's going to be against Americans.
[02:35:48.568 --> 02:35:53.353]  And that's why most of the guys look totally freaked out and depressed because they realize what it was.
[02:35:53.353 --> 02:35:54.054]  I agree with you.
[02:35:54.054 --> 02:35:54.454]  Absolutely.
[02:35:54.574 --> 02:35:56.276]  Yeah, it remains to be seen what's going to happen.
[02:35:56.276 --> 02:35:58.978]  I mean, you've still got both elements are active there.
[02:35:58.978 --> 02:36:02.782]  So there's going to be, they're stepping up the information propaganda war here domestically.
[02:36:02.782 --> 02:36:04.783]  They've been doing... But it shows they're desperate.
[02:36:04.783 --> 02:36:07.826]  It shows they're, because in a way they are telling the truth.
[02:36:07.826 --> 02:36:12.871]  Okay, we're just going to admit we're propagandizing and we're spying on you and we'll secret arrest you.
[02:36:12.871 --> 02:36:14.112]  See, we're honest now.
[02:36:14.372 --> 02:36:14.692]  Right.
[02:36:14.692 --> 02:36:17.973]  They've been doing that physical type of stuff, the anti-insurrection type of things.
[02:36:17.973 --> 02:36:20.054]  They've been doing that in Iraq, Afghanistan.
[02:36:20.054 --> 02:36:21.094]  They've been training.
[02:36:21.094 --> 02:36:22.294]  They're bringing that back home.
[02:36:22.294 --> 02:36:26.235]  But another crucial part of that is, of course, the information war.
[02:36:26.235 --> 02:36:31.297]  You have to realize that in Iraq and Afghanistan, they are also doing an information war there.
[02:36:31.297 --> 02:36:34.017]  They're actively propagandizing the people there.
[02:36:34.017 --> 02:36:42.640]  Now, they're openly declaring, with the repeal of this law that's been in place since right after World War II, they're giving us notice that they're bringing that
[02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:43.640]  Back to him.
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:49.084]  But as we know, you watch any sitcom, drama, you name it, we're getting what the New World Order stands for.
[02:36:49.084 --> 02:36:51.425]  That's all admittedly paid for already.
[02:36:51.425 --> 02:36:55.088]  I mean, they spent billions on No Child Left Behind in fake newscasts.
[02:36:55.088 --> 02:37:00.511]  Billions, I forget the, I think it was like 3, 4 billion or something, or maybe more, just on one program.
[02:37:00.511 --> 02:37:03.033]  200,000 to this talk show host, you know, half a million to that writer.
[02:37:03.553 --> 02:37:06.295]  I mean, a lot of this is going to be open buying media off.
[02:37:06.295 --> 02:37:10.137]  Well, a little bit of truth goes a long way against big lies.
[02:37:10.137 --> 02:37:12.719]  And that's really what this Operation Paul Revere is about.
[02:37:12.719 --> 02:37:15.841]  It's like broadening this out, getting a broader base, letting people...
[02:37:17.412 --> 02:37:20.074]  No one, claiming we're psyops, can argue with this.
[02:37:20.074 --> 02:37:23.577]  We just said, here's the contest, totally organic, it's incredible.
[02:37:23.577 --> 02:37:25.078]  Yeah, and it's a huge contest.
[02:37:25.078 --> 02:37:32.523]  I mean, General Electric took one year to get people to do three minute entries about their topic, and they had a big prize of $100,000.
[02:37:32.523 --> 02:37:34.744]  That's huge for video contests.
[02:37:34.744 --> 02:37:37.086]  Many times you have video contests where the top prize is $1,000, $5,000.
[02:37:37.086 --> 02:37:37.926]  A big one would be $10,000.
[02:37:37.926 --> 02:37:39.647]  When you go to a $100,000 first place prize, that's huge.
[02:37:45.703 --> 02:37:47.584]  Yeah, because we've done 10,000, 5,000, 15,000 before.
[02:37:47.584 --> 02:37:49.946]  And those were huge.
[02:37:49.946 --> 02:37:54.630]  Yeah, and I want to say to the people that are disappointed because, you know, we've had over 600 entries.
[02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:57.772]  We're going to have over 597 people that are going to be disappointed.
[02:37:57.772 --> 02:38:02.015]  Probably even going to have the third place and second place guys a little bit disappointed they didn't win the first place prize.
[02:38:02.856 --> 02:38:06.479]  But you know, I didn't win prizes that I entered here at InfoWars.
[02:38:06.479 --> 02:38:07.779]  Darren McBreen didn't.
[02:38:07.779 --> 02:38:08.380]  Josh didn't.
[02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:14.524]  I mean, we all are working here now, because that's another part of this contest, is trying to identify talent that's going to work with us.
[02:38:14.524 --> 02:38:14.844]  That's right.
[02:38:14.844 --> 02:38:21.429]  We had a reporter contest, but the main backbones of this place now are the people that actually lost.
[02:38:22.574 --> 02:38:24.716]  Because it's about getting to know you.
[02:38:24.716 --> 02:38:26.418]  Right, absolutely.
[02:38:26.418 --> 02:38:36.086]  And I also have to say to the people who are doing this, just because you're not chosen in a contest, I was in a lot of video contests, not just for InfoWars but other ones, and you have to understand it's not about your work.
[02:38:36.086 --> 02:38:36.967]  Don't take it personally.
[02:38:36.967 --> 02:38:39.089]  Some of my best work didn't win.
[02:38:39.089 --> 02:38:41.311]  Some of my worst entries did win.
[02:38:41.311 --> 02:38:43.193]  It's really what people are looking for.
[02:38:43.353 --> 02:38:47.557]  And that's a very difficult thing to ascertain when you don't have any feedback.
[02:38:47.557 --> 02:38:54.944]  You get some guidelines, you kind of know what the topics they are that they're looking for, but unlike a situation where you're actually producing a film in-house, you can't get feedback.
[02:38:54.944 --> 02:38:56.025]  Well, sure, sure, sure.
[02:38:56.025 --> 02:38:58.767]  But I also want to focus, everybody's a winner who did this.
[02:38:58.767 --> 02:39:00.549]  This is about fighting the New World Order.
[02:39:00.549 --> 02:39:01.170]  Right, right.
[02:39:01.170 --> 02:39:02.211]  This is not about...
[02:39:02.811 --> 02:39:15.373]  We did the $115,000 in prizes to, to, to, to, instead of having billions of government funding for the arts to push evil agendas, let's see what $115,000 of Liberty money can do, and it's already reached millions of people.
[02:39:15.373 --> 02:39:15.713]  That's right.
[02:39:15.713 --> 02:39:20.434]  And then the real phase is to see who can follow direction and in two months do something incredible.
[02:39:20.434 --> 02:39:22.015]  And that's, and that's a big part of it.
[02:39:22.015 --> 02:39:27.356]  Just in a couple of months, we got some really outstanding production values from several entries.
[02:39:27.356 --> 02:39:28.796]  It's very difficult to narrow this down.
[02:39:29.036 --> 02:39:40.782]  So it's about fighting the New World Order, getting people to take action, and then also finding people to work with in a filmmaking division that I hope to fund, but that means people need to support us financially.
[02:39:40.782 --> 02:39:47.946]  I mean, this is a place where literally, well this year it's been 100% of the money we make goes into the operation, but usually it's like 96, 97%.
[02:39:47.946 --> 02:39:51.788]  I mean, I am just committed, folks, that what I want is to beat the New World Order.
[02:39:51.788 --> 02:39:56.490]  So buy the books, buy the videos, buy the Beyond Tanya Tangerine and Infowarshealth.com.
[02:39:56.490 --> 02:39:58.131]  Plus, we only promote the best products anyways.
[02:39:58.311 --> 02:39:59.792]  Bye from the good guys.
[02:39:59.792 --> 02:40:01.654]  We need your support.
[02:40:01.654 --> 02:40:06.419]  Also, today's third place, tomorrow's second place, Wednesday's first place.
[02:40:06.419 --> 02:40:09.462]  But I want to showcase a few of the other things as well.
[02:40:09.462 --> 02:40:11.223]  So David, let's start getting into it.
[02:40:11.223 --> 02:40:12.224]  Yeah, we've got an entry here.
[02:40:12.224 --> 02:40:14.366]  Now this one doesn't have high production values.
[02:40:14.366 --> 02:40:15.447]  It was just a lot of fun.
[02:40:15.447 --> 02:40:16.889]  We thought it was a clever take on it.
[02:40:16.889 --> 02:40:19.011]  We did have a lot of documentaries about
[02:40:19.631 --> 02:40:35.125]  GMO and chemtrailing and that sort of thing and we had one that we featured that the guy actually did a documentary and an app it's called look up is called the documentary and the app was Skyder alert and it's a way that people can create a network and report where they're seeing these
[02:40:35.505 --> 02:40:37.146]  Alright, let's go ahead and play a clip of that.
[02:40:54.093 --> 02:40:57.575]  Have you ever wanted to enjoy the chemtrails, but didn't want to have to go outside?
[02:40:57.575 --> 02:41:02.577]  What if I told you there was a product that would allow you to enjoy the chemtrails from inside your own home?
[02:41:02.577 --> 02:41:07.760]  Hi, I'm Director of Technology at the Pentagon, and I'm here to tell you about the Indoor Chemtrailer.
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:14.543]  After wasting billions of tax dollars spraying chemtrails in the skies, the Pentagon realized not enough people go outdoors anymore.
[02:41:14.543 --> 02:41:21.087]  That's when they came up with the idea for the Indoor Chemtrailer that takes the chemtrails out of the skies and puts them into your home.
[02:41:21.087 --> 02:41:22.527]  But don't take my word for it.
[02:41:22.527 --> 02:41:23.708]  Check out this demonstration.
[02:41:25.267 --> 02:41:28.868]  Kick it on right here with the on switch.
[02:41:28.868 --> 02:41:31.169]  And now you want to breathe it in John.
[02:41:31.169 --> 02:41:32.829]  Start to feel that barium.
[02:41:32.829 --> 02:41:33.610]  Aluminum.
[02:41:33.610 --> 02:41:34.850]  Filling up your lungs.
[02:41:34.850 --> 02:41:38.191]  You'll get flu-like symptoms in the first two days.
[02:41:38.191 --> 02:41:40.052]  Guaranteed!
[02:41:40.052 --> 02:41:41.832]  You're going to notice coughing.
[02:41:41.832 --> 02:41:43.633]  You're going to notice sneezing.
[02:41:43.633 --> 02:41:45.533]  You're going to notice bleeding.
[02:41:45.533 --> 02:41:53.756]  And the best part is, it's jam-packed full of nanobots that are going to get into your lungs and your bloodstream and start hacking away at your cell walls.
[02:41:56.792 --> 02:42:01.875]  Because film is the main form of communication now, and the resistance, everybody's got to get in on it.
[02:42:01.875 --> 02:42:02.716]  That's right, that's right.
[02:42:02.716 --> 02:42:08.659]  And there's some little inside jokes in that, like, you know, the 800 number he calls got the number 322, which, you know, is associated with skull and bones.
[02:42:08.659 --> 02:42:08.939]  Yeah.
[02:42:08.939 --> 02:42:11.241]  So he's got a lot of little inside things there.
[02:42:11.241 --> 02:42:15.683]  Now the next one we've got is a very serious entry, and this is from a filmmaker out of Michigan.
[02:42:15.683 --> 02:42:22.928]  It's Huron Films, and his name, I apologize if I'm mispronouncing this, is Istvan Latong, and it's called A Dream Revered.
[02:42:22.928 --> 02:42:24.509]  It's excellent, here it is.
[02:42:25.345 --> 02:42:27.586]  I hired into General Motors' Hydromatic Division in 1978.
[02:42:27.586 --> 02:42:33.009]  It was a good job, I liked the work, and the pay was good, with benefits.
[02:42:33.009 --> 02:42:36.070]  But soon after, the auto industry started having problems.
[02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:39.992]  Hiring stopped and gradually the plant started downsizing and closing.
[02:42:39.992 --> 02:42:43.054]  I'd like to direct my question to Mr. Perreault.
[02:42:43.054 --> 02:42:48.556]  What will you do as president to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business?
[02:42:48.556 --> 02:42:51.498]  We have a strange situation because we have
[02:42:52.478 --> 02:42:59.363]  A process in Washington where, after you've served for a while, you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month.
[02:42:59.363 --> 02:43:03.485]  We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.
[02:43:03.485 --> 02:43:07.868]  To those of you in the audience who are business people, pretty simple.
[02:43:07.868 --> 02:43:19.796]  If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour as a factory worker, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young 25- let's assume you've been in business for a long time, you've got a mature workforce.
[02:43:19.796 --> 02:43:21.017]  Pay $1 an hour for your labor,
[02:43:22.338 --> 02:43:23.379]  Have no health care.
[02:43:23.379 --> 02:43:26.261]  That's the most expensive single element making a cut.
[02:43:26.261 --> 02:43:31.845]  Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement.
[02:43:31.845 --> 02:43:34.607]  And you don't care about anything but making money.
[02:43:34.607 --> 02:43:37.069]  There will be a giant sucking sound going south.
[02:43:38.618 --> 02:43:40.841]  It breaks my heart to see those jobs gone.
[02:43:40.841 --> 02:43:43.144]  My children would have benefited from them.
[02:43:43.144 --> 02:43:45.466]  It's very sad for all our children.
[02:43:45.466 --> 02:43:49.131]  The apathy in the plants, as this went on, was pitiful.
[02:43:49.131 --> 02:43:52.235]  But having a front row seat, I learned a few things.
[02:43:52.235 --> 02:43:55.038]  What I learned is best understood seeing the result first.
[02:43:55.899 --> 02:43:57.762]  This is Detroit.
[02:43:57.762 --> 02:44:05.312]  Once proudly known as the Motor City, now in ruin, factories and businesses gone, homes repossessed, neighborhoods in shambles.
[02:44:05.312 --> 02:44:10.839]  Here is the result of a treaty and international finance empowered by tyrannical government.
[02:44:10.839 --> 02:44:12.241]  Take a good look.
[02:44:12.241 --> 02:44:13.323]  It's what's in store for you.
[02:44:16.107 --> 02:44:18.068]  Why is the government so concerned about us?
[02:44:18.068 --> 02:44:21.369]  When did our ideas become dangerous?
[02:44:21.369 --> 02:44:26.510]  Who allowed our good jobs to be lost to slave labor and no environmental laws in foreign lands?
[02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:31.352]  And who brought us into illegal foreign wars with people who posed America no threat?
[02:44:31.352 --> 02:44:33.872]  Alright, now that's a few clips from A Dream Revered.
[02:44:33.872 --> 02:44:36.673]  It's even more powerful for radio listeners if you go watch it.
[02:44:36.673 --> 02:44:40.414]  The full films at Infowars.com forward slash Paul.
[02:44:40.414 --> 02:44:41.395]  Obviously for Paul Revere.
[02:44:41.395 --> 02:44:45.416]  I want to just say, we debated a lot whether this would be fourth place or third place.
[02:44:47.248 --> 02:44:51.293]  And this is actually what we're looking for in filmmaking.
[02:44:51.293 --> 02:44:57.440]  Okay, so if I had the money, I would just make you pay out two number threes.
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:02.906]  We almost had to flip a coin on this, but more people thought it would be the next one that is the third place winner.
[02:45:02.906 --> 02:45:07.351]  I think by one vote, because I let the office all watch these and vote, and then I made the final decision.
[02:45:08.552 --> 02:45:21.578]  Um, and then even I'm doubting it even now, but, but, you know, the issue is this is the kind of people we want to work with, go see the full film, Dream Revered, but they expose the globalists, they fight the new world order, they expose the offshoring and outsourcing of jobs.
[02:45:21.578 --> 02:45:25.440]  Uh, and so I can say Dream Revered is the honorable mention, really fourth place.
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:31.622]  And without further ado, uh, the third place winner, David Knight, that barely did, they did a great job as well.
[02:45:31.622 --> 02:45:35.344]  So I think the reason we're giving this the win is it probably a little more work went into it.
[02:45:35.344 --> 02:45:37.445]  Uh, and it's also, we needed, we need something to be funny.
[02:45:37.685 --> 02:45:38.285]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:45:38.285 --> 02:45:38.786]  That's the thing.
[02:45:38.786 --> 02:45:39.546]  It's the difference.
[02:45:39.546 --> 02:45:46.729]  And we had a great film, Dream Revered was great film work, and this was very well done as well.
[02:45:46.729 --> 02:45:48.010]  And it's a great satire.
[02:45:48.010 --> 02:45:53.273]  And you know, it's very effective to use comedy and satire and political cartoons.
[02:45:53.273 --> 02:45:57.355]  And so this is an animated political cartoon that makes a lot of points.
[02:45:57.355 --> 02:45:58.955]  And it's Political Earth.
[02:45:58.955 --> 02:46:02.337]  Political Earth by Scooter Downey and the Brobarian Brothers.
[02:46:02.337 --> 02:46:02.777]  And they win $5,000.
[02:46:02.777 --> 02:46:03.117]  That's right.
[02:46:04.378 --> 02:46:07.380]  So we're going to get them on the show the next few days via Skype.
[02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:09.761]  And then we need to obviously mail them their check.
[02:46:09.761 --> 02:46:16.824]  And then also probably fly them out here to talk about doing work with us in the future, either from where they're at or actually here with us in the future.
[02:46:16.824 --> 02:46:18.545]  It's all a big think tank.
[02:46:18.545 --> 02:46:19.926]  And so you're third place.
[02:46:19.926 --> 02:46:21.107]  Here's a clip of that.
[02:46:21.107 --> 02:46:22.627]  Hello!
[02:46:22.627 --> 02:46:24.448]  I'm Du Bois the Reason!
[02:46:24.448 --> 02:46:29.131]  Political animal expert!
[02:46:29.131 --> 02:46:30.291]  Adrenaline junkie!
[02:46:30.291 --> 02:46:33.473]  And again, I'm going to narrate a little bit of this for the radio audience.
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:46.852]  He's like a nature guy on Animal Planet, showing with the allegory of animals how the political stuff works, divide and conquer manipulation.
[02:46:46.852 --> 02:46:56.562]  We will dive down into the virtual underground to explore the internet!
[02:47:02.782 --> 02:47:04.783]  Surveillance cameras and that.
[02:47:04.783 --> 02:47:06.364]  Just grabbed your email.
[02:47:06.364 --> 02:47:11.106]  They're exposing the whole NSA command bases underground.
[02:47:11.106 --> 02:47:12.807]  Watch out for false flags.
[02:47:30.964 --> 02:47:38.811]  Where the next generation of intellectual giants are saddled with loans and worthless degrees.
[02:47:38.811 --> 02:47:40.012]  Up here!
[02:47:40.012 --> 02:47:49.741]  Left-wing academics swarm together into destructive, ideological flocks.
[02:47:49.741 --> 02:47:54.185]  Their pupils try to escape without being indoctrinated.
[02:47:57.401 --> 02:48:03.765]  A baby owl or is that a baby duck jumps out of the tree?
[02:48:03.765 --> 02:48:06.868]  Oh, look at it!
[02:48:06.868 --> 02:48:10.570]  It's so weighed down by all the books.
[02:48:10.570 --> 02:48:12.071]  Student Aid.
[02:48:12.071 --> 02:48:14.833]  And head into the financial wilderness.
[02:48:14.833 --> 02:48:17.135]  The den of thieves.
[02:48:17.135 --> 02:48:20.277]  The bankers.
[02:48:20.277 --> 02:48:24.700]  Well, the fat cats of Wall Street and their predatory loans.
[02:48:27.828 --> 02:48:31.670]  Strip well from the bone of the average bear.
[02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:38.515]  Yeah, we'll learn that the masses cannot cross the megabanks and the river of toxic assets.
[02:48:38.515 --> 02:48:39.095]  Alligators.
[02:48:39.095 --> 02:48:39.695]  Crocodiles.
[02:48:39.695 --> 02:48:42.577]  Ah, the Federal Reserve.
[02:48:42.577 --> 02:48:43.338]  Ah-ha-ha!
[02:48:43.338 --> 02:48:47.981]  Oh man, this is good.
[02:48:47.981 --> 02:48:50.102]  It's simply too big to fail.
[02:48:51.380 --> 02:48:54.121]  Now I'm thinking this is second place, but I've already said third place.
[02:48:54.121 --> 02:48:55.002]  That's really hard.
[02:48:55.002 --> 02:48:58.544]  We want to work with these folks as well.
[02:48:58.544 --> 02:49:06.388]  I just don't have the money to organize it all.
[02:49:06.388 --> 02:49:08.249]  Now they scale the mountains of derivative fraud.
[02:49:15.959 --> 02:49:18.821]  Very, very rich with visual allegories, you know.
[02:49:18.821 --> 02:49:20.902]  For radio, you can't really take it all in.
[02:49:20.902 --> 02:49:26.725]  He's got left-wing academics that are owls in cap and gowns, and they've only got one wing, and the other's unarmed, so it kind of floats.
[02:49:26.725 --> 02:49:32.249]  And he pulls it back, and you see, you know, written out, brainwashed, you know, as the birds are flying along.
[02:49:32.249 --> 02:49:42.675]  He's got that last thing, there was croc-a-fraud, which was a giant crocodile that ate the people that were trying to go through the toxic assets pond, and said it was too big to fail.
[02:49:42.975 --> 02:49:50.678]  So he's got a lot of rich allegories in it, it's a lot of fun, and political cartoons have always been a very effective way to get the message out.
[02:49:50.678 --> 02:49:53.759]  Man, every time I watch one of these though, I think it's like first place.
[02:49:53.759 --> 02:49:56.320]  It's like so hard, because they're all so good.
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:49:59.862]  So we keep going back and we keep watching these things over and over and over again, and it's...
[02:50:00.242 --> 02:50:01.564]  Yeah, I'm ready for the contest to be over.
[02:50:01.564 --> 02:50:06.429]  It's been a bigger drain on our resources and time than I thought it would be.
[02:50:06.429 --> 02:50:12.276]  And you offered to spearhead it, so I really appreciate the hard work you've done, David.
[02:50:12.276 --> 02:50:14.939]  Tomorrow we're going to have second place announced.
[02:50:15.239 --> 02:50:17.720]  Yes, yes, and we'll be playing a couple more too.
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:26.045]  And we're going to be showcasing on the Nightly News, on the radio, your work folks, the Top 35 and others, for the next year.
[02:50:26.045 --> 02:50:29.847]  I mean, we're going to make sure all these get hundreds of thousands of views and many of them millions.
[02:50:29.847 --> 02:50:39.092]  We have an interview tonight on the Nightly News with one of the filmmakers who submitted something late, so we have it up as an honorable mention, and it's about Child Protective Services.
[02:50:39.092 --> 02:50:41.153]  It's a must-see film.
[02:50:41.153 --> 02:50:42.034]  Tell the folks the name of that.
[02:50:43.035 --> 02:50:44.077]  Uncle Sam's kids.
[02:50:44.077 --> 02:50:44.798]  Uncle Sam's kids.
[02:50:44.798 --> 02:50:45.159]  That's it.
[02:50:45.159 --> 02:50:45.399]  Thank you.
[02:50:45.399 --> 02:50:45.920]  Absolutely.
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:47.803]  It popped in my head as soon as I said it.
[02:50:47.803 --> 02:50:49.046]  Alright, great job David Knight.
[02:50:49.046 --> 02:50:50.909]  Infowars.com forward slash Paul.
[02:50:50.909 --> 02:50:52.632]  We're going to come back with your phone calls.
[02:50:52.632 --> 02:50:53.213]  Thanks for holding.
[02:50:53.213 --> 02:50:53.614]  Stay with us.
[02:50:55.034 --> 02:50:58.075]  Again, that's InfoWars.com forward slash Paul.
[02:50:58.075 --> 02:50:59.835]  And please send that link out to your friends and family.
[02:50:59.835 --> 02:51:01.636]  Say, wow, look at these videos.
[02:51:01.636 --> 02:51:03.036]  This is how the InfoWars works.
[02:51:03.036 --> 02:51:04.337]  We win.
[02:51:04.337 --> 02:51:05.597]  What does freedom mean to you?
[02:51:05.597 --> 02:51:08.758]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[02:51:08.758 --> 02:51:12.559]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.
[02:51:12.559 --> 02:51:19.101]  In July, for every $329 you spend on our highly nutritious, great-tasting food, you will receive
[02:51:19.701 --> 02:51:20.001]  I think so.
[02:51:35.503 --> 02:51:35.783]  I think so.
[02:52:04.068 --> 02:52:12.114]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[02:52:12.114 --> 02:52:15.796]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[02:52:15.796 --> 02:52:21.620]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[02:52:22.501 --> 02:52:33.712]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[02:52:33.712 --> 02:52:37.835]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[02:52:38.576 --> 02:52:47.241]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[02:52:47.241 --> 02:52:51.084]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[02:52:51.084 --> 02:52:53.545]  It's something much darker.
[02:52:53.545 --> 02:52:59.229]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[02:52:59.229 --> 02:53:03.371]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[02:53:03.371 --> 02:53:07.374]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:08.112 --> 02:53:11.155]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:11.155 --> 02:53:20.125]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:20.125 --> 02:53:25.030]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:25.663 --> 02:53:37.035]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:37.035 --> 02:53:44.042]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:44.702 --> 02:53:49.005]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[02:53:49.005 --> 02:53:52.608]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:52.608 --> 02:53:56.851]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[02:53:56.851 --> 02:53:59.873]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:53:59.873 --> 02:54:01.154]  Protect your immune system.
[02:54:01.154 --> 02:54:02.175]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:17.656 --> 02:54:22.357]  I gotta listen to some more Bob Marley.
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:46.601]  Right here, I love this part.
[02:54:46.601 --> 02:54:49.402]  Right here, it gets heavy.
[02:55:15.930 --> 02:55:20.511]  The brotherly love.
[02:55:20.511 --> 02:55:21.571]  In an ancient time.
[02:55:21.571 --> 02:55:24.032]  Brotherly love.
[02:55:24.032 --> 02:55:26.212]  I feel this morning.
[02:55:43.931 --> 02:55:46.511]  That's probably one of my favorite Bob Marley songs.
[02:55:46.511 --> 02:55:48.172]  What's the one about I hear the birds tweet?
[02:55:48.172 --> 02:55:49.212]  I like that one.
[02:55:49.212 --> 02:55:49.992]  My kids love that.
[02:55:49.992 --> 02:55:53.533]  Alright!
[02:55:53.533 --> 02:55:57.994]  I grew up listening to that on, you know, turntable, uh, tabletop.
[02:55:57.994 --> 02:56:02.514]  It's called Three Little Birds.
[02:56:02.514 --> 02:56:04.375]  They don't want to see us unite.
[02:56:04.375 --> 02:56:06.515]  They want to see us all in fight with each other.
[02:56:06.515 --> 02:56:08.676]  That's the mark of a Fed right there, folks.
[02:56:08.676 --> 02:56:10.436]  That's the mark of a globalist right there.
[02:56:11.767 --> 02:56:16.689]  I say unite around liberty and freedom and justice and not fight with each other.
[02:56:16.689 --> 02:56:18.690]  Let's go to Chris in Kentucky, then Julio and others.
[02:56:18.690 --> 02:56:20.371]  I'm going to do some overdrive.
[02:56:20.371 --> 02:56:21.791]  Chris, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:56:21.791 --> 02:56:22.852]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:56:22.852 --> 02:56:23.712]  Yes, thanks, Alex.
[02:56:23.712 --> 02:56:26.834]  It's been a while, but I tell you, we got some news with the gun issue.
[02:56:26.834 --> 02:56:28.855]  You've been calling me like 15, 16 years.
[02:56:28.855 --> 02:56:30.235]  I haven't heard from you in years.
[02:56:30.235 --> 02:56:31.416]  Yeah, it's been a long time.
[02:56:31.416 --> 02:56:33.897]  I've been busy slaving too and trying to get through.
[02:56:33.897 --> 02:56:34.317]  That's right.
[02:56:34.317 --> 02:56:36.278]  You used to run a TV station or something, right?
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:38.100]  No, I didn't run a TV station.
[02:56:38.100 --> 02:56:41.321]  I had somebody that had a radio show here that was kicked off, of course.
[02:56:41.321 --> 02:56:44.882]  You were working with somebody on a TV station, but it doesn't matter.
[02:56:44.882 --> 02:56:45.202]  Go ahead.
[02:56:45.202 --> 02:56:46.503]  Oh, okay.
[02:56:46.503 --> 02:56:55.485]  Yeah, the homicide problem here in Loyola, the solution is now let's get the federal agents in the military helping with the police, and they're making it sound so sweet on the news.
[02:56:56.065 --> 02:56:58.507]  You know, it's not going to... Oh, I know, I know.
[02:56:58.507 --> 02:57:06.752]  They collapse society, ship the drugs in, and now in Louisville, Kentucky, Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, let's put troops on the streets.
[02:57:06.752 --> 02:57:08.173]  Who was then aimed at the people.
[02:57:08.173 --> 02:57:12.956]  No, we're going into martial law, and Chris, you've been listening 15 years.
[02:57:12.956 --> 02:57:15.178]  Did I not say it would be done like this incrementally?
[02:57:15.836 --> 02:57:17.318]  You predicted it right, and here it is.
[02:57:17.318 --> 02:57:18.078]  It's right in front of our face.
[02:57:18.078 --> 02:57:18.919]  Of course it wasn't hard.
[02:57:18.919 --> 02:57:20.961]  I went to the drills and I admitted it.
[02:57:20.961 --> 02:57:21.862]  How does you know, Jones?
[02:57:21.862 --> 02:57:23.264]  Oh, they said exactly what it means.
[02:57:23.264 --> 02:57:24.845]  Like, how do they know?
[02:57:24.845 --> 02:57:28.149]  Well, they said 1-2-3, and they did 1-2-3.
[02:57:28.149 --> 02:57:30.471]  I tell you, the military better leave me alone.
[02:57:30.471 --> 02:57:37.658]  It's getting to the point where I'm running into it, and they're usually nice guys too, but they're there to acclimate, and I'm like, you should not be here with the police.
[02:57:37.658 --> 02:57:37.999]  Go ahead.
[02:57:38.757 --> 02:57:39.998]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[02:57:39.998 --> 02:57:45.342]  And I tell you, I want to thank you for having an interview with Sheriff Denny Paveman from Jackson County in this state.
[02:57:45.342 --> 02:57:47.063]  He's a great guy.
[02:57:47.063 --> 02:57:49.165]  That's the answer to tyranny is that.
[02:57:49.165 --> 02:57:50.346]  That man is 1776.
[02:57:50.346 --> 02:57:54.809]  That's exactly what we need is every sheriff in this country we need.
[02:57:54.809 --> 02:57:56.570]  Because if we don't, you know, it's over.
[02:57:56.570 --> 02:57:57.971]  Let's get on and get aboard that ship.
[02:57:57.971 --> 02:58:02.094]  What I love about patriot sheriffs and police chiefs is they're good men and women.
[02:58:02.094 --> 02:58:02.995]  They're well-spoken.
[02:58:02.995 --> 02:58:03.775]  They care.
[02:58:03.775 --> 02:58:05.276]  They have a lot of liberty in their eyes.
[02:58:05.276 --> 02:58:06.938]  Then you see these sacks of
[02:58:07.638 --> 02:58:13.423]  Scruffulous garbage that are there with Holder at these anti-gun things with Feinstein.
[02:58:13.423 --> 02:58:17.106]  And they look like clowns in the little police outfits and all.
[02:58:17.106 --> 02:58:18.948]  I mean, they're a joke!
[02:58:18.948 --> 02:58:20.689]  I will not be ruled by a bunch of criminals.
[02:58:20.689 --> 02:58:22.791]  God bless you, sir.
[02:58:22.791 --> 02:58:24.032]  Good to hear from that guy.
[02:58:24.032 --> 02:58:25.653]  Yeah, guys, pull that up.
[02:58:25.653 --> 02:58:26.915]  I actually saw that a week ago.
[02:58:26.915 --> 02:58:28.596]  I never covered it.
[02:58:28.596 --> 02:58:30.638]  Call for military on streets of Louisville.
[02:58:31.701 --> 02:58:38.184]  By the way, I show off around here that I am able to say it, Lou, Lou, not Louisville.
[02:58:38.184 --> 02:58:41.345]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[02:58:41.345 --> 02:58:43.626]  They want to invade that area with trips.
[02:58:43.626 --> 02:58:44.867]  They want to acclimate you.
[02:58:44.867 --> 02:58:46.448]  It's for your guns, folks.
[02:58:46.448 --> 02:58:48.809]  Make no mistake, it's all acclimation.
[02:58:48.809 --> 02:58:50.730]  Follow us at Twitter, RealAlexJones.
[02:58:54.013 --> 02:58:55.894]  Introducing Pro-1.

[02:58:59.557 --> 02:59:04.080]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:10.204]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:59:10.204 --> 02:59:20.992]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:59:21.192 --> 02:59:27.676]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[02:59:27.676 --> 02:59:42.704]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and
[02:59:42.904 --> 02:59:45.325]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:08.786 --> 03:00:13.610]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:13.610 --> 03:00:15.231]  You want answers?
[03:00:15.231 --> 03:00:16.753]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:16.753 --> 03:00:20.936]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:20.936 --> 03:00:25.020]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:45.031 --> 03:00:49.214]  Here's some of the headlines up on Infowars.com breaking.
[03:00:49.214 --> 03:00:50.555]  Activist group demands U.N.
[03:00:50.555 --> 03:00:53.778]  stop Chicago from closing public schools.
[03:00:53.778 --> 03:00:55.099]  We told you that was coming with Obama.
[03:00:55.099 --> 03:00:56.780]  That was his plan.
[03:00:56.780 --> 03:01:00.803]  To where it's all corporate run schools that are even worse than the government schools.
[03:01:00.803 --> 03:01:04.927]  Robbery of Cyprus bank accounts doubles in size.
[03:01:07.383 --> 03:01:17.730]  Yeah, you hear about a robbery of a hotel room jewels in France, but what about a 47.5% robbery of Cyprus bank accounts doubles in size?
[03:01:17.730 --> 03:01:24.815]  Globalist, Agiprop, Hillary Clinton, the miniseries, I'll tell you, it hurts.
[03:01:26.092 --> 03:01:28.252]  Kurtz wrote a lot of articles.
[03:01:28.252 --> 03:01:31.793]  I don't know if the average person knows what an adjaprop is.
[03:01:31.793 --> 03:01:32.293]  I barely do.
[03:01:32.293 --> 03:01:35.594]  I have to remember what it is in Soviet nomenclature.
[03:01:35.594 --> 03:01:39.035]  And Rand Paul strikes back against anti-freedom enemies.
[03:01:39.035 --> 03:01:42.035]  Government promises to stop lying because of drudge report.
[03:01:42.035 --> 03:01:46.536]  Spotlight MSNBC host says newborn infants don't count as alive.
[03:01:46.536 --> 03:01:50.577]  Joining the chorus, Pentagon says they have lost control of independent media led by
[03:01:51.448 --> 03:01:52.810]  Drudge?
[03:01:52.810 --> 03:01:56.714]  80% of US adults are near poverty, rely on welfare, or unemployed.
[03:01:56.714 --> 03:01:58.296]  Yep, that's why they're winning.
[03:01:58.296 --> 03:02:05.164]  We're winning the waking up people that can be woken up, but the globalists are just gutting the country so fast it makes my head spin.
[03:02:05.164 --> 03:02:07.267]  Let's go to Julio real fast.
[03:02:07.267 --> 03:02:07.807]  You're on the air.
[03:02:07.807 --> 03:02:09.890]  What's your take, Julio, on the Pentagon press conference?
[03:02:11.294 --> 03:02:21.284]  Yeah, I watched that entire press conference last night and it was just so interesting to see George Little, the way he would fake laugh from time to time.
[03:02:21.284 --> 03:02:23.847]  You sound like Carson Mahal.
[03:02:23.847 --> 03:02:26.150]  Oh, Buffy, it's your turn now.
[03:02:28.414 --> 03:02:51.865]  It was just so fascinating watching that one woman who spoke hostile, I butchered her last name, but when she talked about propaganda and spin and how quickly George Little tried to steer away from that, oh, I don't want to refer to it as spin, but yes, we do have to tell the truth, and he mentioned about smartphones and
[03:02:52.745 --> 03:02:56.909]  Technology really driving independent media, alternative media.
[03:02:56.909 --> 03:03:08.841]  He's basically admitting that the listening audience, myself, anyone who is a journalist has the ability right now to get any piece of information at real-time speed.
[03:03:08.841 --> 03:03:10.783]  Well yeah, that's what freaks him out, as he said.
[03:03:10.783 --> 03:03:14.547]  Look, we can't lie when their smartphone will show a photo of it.
[03:03:14.547 --> 03:03:15.067]  So really...
[03:03:15.828 --> 03:03:26.836]  They're just shifting game plan and saying, we're going to be good guys now for the demoralized Psycorps that don't like being deceptive against good people.
[03:03:26.836 --> 03:03:27.576]  But that's the lie.
[03:03:27.576 --> 03:03:31.980]  You become deceptive against bad, you don't become good, you become bad.
[03:03:32.820 --> 03:03:44.867]  And it's a very sophisticated thing, but the whole point is, they are running the white flag up and saying, we're rolling out cyber security against the web, we're going to infiltrate the local media, we're going to buy people off.
[03:03:44.867 --> 03:03:46.308]  That's not going to work either.
[03:03:46.308 --> 03:03:54.133]  Because globalism is going to shut everything down, no matter how much BS they shovel, reality will come to the fore.
[03:03:54.873 --> 03:04:01.518]  And as long as we point out we have state-run media, the globalists are criminal, the government's illegitimate, it's over for the New World Order.
[03:04:01.518 --> 03:04:02.959]  Do you agree with that term?
[03:04:02.959 --> 03:04:04.640]  State-run media?
[03:04:04.640 --> 03:04:05.360]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:08.543]  I call it corporate media since they're all run by multinational corporations.
[03:04:08.543 --> 03:04:11.645]  They work for the megacorporations of the world, really.
[03:04:11.645 --> 03:04:16.028]  But they're using the state with our taxpayer money and stuff to direct it.
[03:04:17.401 --> 03:04:21.242]  In my experience, when I covered NATO last summer, I saw state-run media.
[03:04:21.242 --> 03:04:26.844]  I thought, being inside the NATO Summit, we were going to get actual documents, real information of what's going on.
[03:04:26.844 --> 03:04:34.267]  Instead, we got PR, emails of what they agreed on, and every news organization from around the world... Regards to the candidate.
[03:04:34.267 --> 03:04:35.787]  ...repeated the exact same thing.
[03:04:35.787 --> 03:04:36.248]  No, no, no.
[03:04:36.248 --> 03:04:43.170]  That's why the Pentagon and the White House have said, let's just go to straight-up, not even press conferences, we'll put a statement out.
[03:04:43.170 --> 03:04:46.011]  But then the veterans' office folks go, oh no, they'll pick that apart.
[03:04:47.318 --> 03:04:49.179]  Let's go engage them.
[03:04:49.179 --> 03:04:52.801]  But they'll just buy off one blogger and then another blogger will start up.
[03:04:52.801 --> 03:04:53.962]  Look, it's over.
[03:04:53.962 --> 03:04:54.863]  It's over.
[03:04:54.863 --> 03:04:59.806]  The only question is we have to go through what the Germans did or the Russians did before we wake up to it.
[03:04:59.806 --> 03:05:01.507]  Please, let's learn from history, folks.
[03:05:01.507 --> 03:05:02.468]  We're coming back live.
[03:05:02.468 --> 03:05:02.868]  Stay with us.
[03:05:04.184 --> 03:05:06.085]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:05:06.085 --> 03:05:09.726]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[03:05:09.726 --> 03:05:14.308]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:05:14.308 --> 03:05:20.370]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.

[03:05:29.813 --> 03:05:30.133]  All right.

[03:07:08.950 --> 03:07:10.591]  What are bitcoins?
[03:07:10.591 --> 03:07:17.074]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[03:07:17.074 --> 03:07:18.475]  No bank needed.
[03:07:18.895 --> 03:07:24.581]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[03:07:24.581 --> 03:07:26.844]  You are in control of your money.

[03:08:07.337 --> 03:08:12.864]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:12.864 --> 03:08:16.688]  There's more videos and foreign news articles where the al-Qaeda forces...
[03:08:17.879 --> 03:08:30.633]  That our loving government, our illegitimate, criminal, banker-run government have put in charge of the Middle East, murdering Christians en masse, chopping their heads off, throwing them off buildings, shooting men, women, and children, torturing children.
[03:08:30.633 --> 03:08:32.015]  I mean, you can go look at it.
[03:08:32.015 --> 03:08:32.675]  It's all up there.
[03:08:32.675 --> 03:08:33.736]  It's a daily stream.
[03:08:33.736 --> 03:08:37.340]  We're going to get Syrian Girl, who predicted it all over a year ago on this show, on.
[03:08:38.260 --> 03:08:40.261]  with us to go over it all in the next few days.
[03:08:40.261 --> 03:08:45.043]  We're going to get G. Everett Griffin on the broadcast as well and a lot of other very informative guests.
[03:08:45.043 --> 03:08:47.044]  I promise to go to your phone calls.
[03:08:47.044 --> 03:08:48.405]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[03:08:48.405 --> 03:08:55.488]  I want to play a clip I didn't get to earlier of Greenwald saying, look, they lied to us.
[03:08:55.488 --> 03:09:00.530]  The NSA, their lowliest employees can dial right in and listen to you in live time.
[03:09:00.530 --> 03:09:04.412]  Folks, that's been done since World War II.
[03:09:06.744 --> 03:09:11.026]  That without warrants they would have operators punch in and listen to people.
[03:09:11.026 --> 03:09:16.888]  But now they've just got it where they can dial in, just like you could have an app to follow your husband or wife with their cell phone.
[03:09:16.888 --> 03:09:18.989]  That app doubles for you to be able to use it.
[03:09:18.989 --> 03:09:22.811]  That's the system by law, globally.
[03:09:22.811 --> 03:09:24.211]  Engineered into all the phones.
[03:09:24.211 --> 03:09:28.213]  They have international conferences so the governments can track you.
[03:09:28.213 --> 03:09:32.975]  Of course they're now announcing, Alex it's true there's face scanning cameras on the street corners.
[03:09:34.753 --> 03:09:36.814]  Alex, it's true, they're following everybody.
[03:09:36.814 --> 03:09:40.995]  Stores are using your purchase history to rip you off and charge you more.
[03:09:40.995 --> 03:09:50.998]  That's why they have digital price tags now and they are aware of, they're using this intel and the smart meters are controlling your thermostat and charging you.
[03:09:50.998 --> 03:09:53.779]  Yeah, they all said they were going to do this.
[03:09:53.779 --> 03:09:55.819]  I keep trying to explain that to people.
[03:09:55.819 --> 03:10:01.541]  I don't just get up here and say, you know, 15 years ago they're going to have smart meters and track everything you do and control your thermostat.
[03:10:01.541 --> 03:10:03.482]  And I was reading from MIT.
[03:10:05.509 --> 03:10:10.373]  And I'm telling you, everything I've seen these people say they're going to do, they're going to do it.
[03:10:10.373 --> 03:10:12.595]  They write books about all the stuff they put in the water to hurt us.
[03:10:12.595 --> 03:10:14.497]  I mean, these are murderers.
[03:10:14.497 --> 03:10:18.721]  And quite frankly, legally and lawfully under common law, we could all get violent with these people right now.
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:22.601]  That would play into their plan.
[03:10:22.601 --> 03:10:27.584]  I want to awaken humanity and try to have as least bloodshed as possible.
[03:10:27.584 --> 03:10:32.207]  When we start cornering these people, they're going to get violent and blame us for it already.
[03:10:32.207 --> 03:10:43.073]  We want to be able to expose they did that violence and show how bad they are, instead of go out and have them frame our violence as OC proof we're bad.
[03:10:43.073 --> 03:10:46.095]  And they know they're going to force people into confrontation.
[03:10:46.095 --> 03:10:49.097]  And for those of you that want confrontation, you're going to probably get it.
[03:10:49.773 --> 03:10:53.194]  This probably isn't going to get fixed without a lot of bloodshed at one point.
[03:10:53.194 --> 03:11:03.115]  The question is, is it a few thousand dead, and then they stand down and get arrested, or is it going to be 100 million dead in the U.S.?
[03:11:03.115 --> 03:11:09.777]  The communists, and that's basically who these people are, they're technocrats above it, but it's a communist model.
[03:11:09.777 --> 03:11:17.038]  They, in the 70s, it was declassified when they took over with re-education camps with the Weathermen, that they wanted to kill 50 million people.
[03:11:18.140 --> 03:11:21.741]  You can look up those video clips from people that were in the trials.
[03:11:21.741 --> 03:11:23.982]  Those film clips.
[03:11:23.982 --> 03:11:25.503]  Look, people say, what do they want?
[03:11:25.503 --> 03:11:26.703]  They want to kill people.
[03:11:26.703 --> 03:11:29.704]  They want to be able to come to your house and torture you while they rape your wife.
[03:11:29.704 --> 03:11:31.765]  And you're like, why?
[03:11:31.765 --> 03:11:33.846]  Because that's what they like to do.
[03:11:33.846 --> 03:11:39.187]  They don't like working hard and being good and building things and being wholesome and having good friends.
[03:11:39.187 --> 03:11:40.228]  They like hurting people.
[03:11:40.228 --> 03:11:41.888]  I mean, have you not figured that out yet?
[03:11:41.888 --> 03:11:43.469]  Have you not studied history yet?
[03:11:43.469 --> 03:11:46.290]  And if we don't stand up against them, they're going to have their way.
[03:11:47.506 --> 03:11:52.968]  So all I can say is let's work as hard as we can, in the sunshine, as the sun sets on liberty.
[03:11:52.968 --> 03:11:55.530]  Because it's going to come back around, don't worry.
[03:11:55.530 --> 03:11:56.850]  The sun will rise again.
[03:11:56.850 --> 03:12:00.712]  Let's work to get as many people as awake as possible.
[03:12:00.712 --> 03:12:05.714]  So that when the sun really goes down, people wake up and know what to do.
[03:12:05.714 --> 03:12:09.856]  Because let me tell you folks, if it goes to a full bore civil war, it ain't going to stop.
[03:12:10.569 --> 03:12:12.970]  And it's going to be bad.
[03:12:12.970 --> 03:12:19.593]  And for all the people that serve the system, some of you macho guys that think you're going to have a war with the American people, you're going to show us?
[03:12:19.593 --> 03:12:22.034]  You're fools.
[03:12:22.034 --> 03:12:26.937]  You have taken the restraint of the American patriot as weakness, and you have no idea.
[03:12:26.937 --> 03:12:30.758]  You have no idea how hard you're going to get hammered.
[03:12:30.758 --> 03:12:32.839]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go to your phone calls.
[03:12:32.839 --> 03:12:35.320]  Let's talk to Aaron in Texas.
[03:12:35.320 --> 03:12:36.001]  You're on the air.
[03:12:36.001 --> 03:12:36.361]  Go ahead.
[03:12:37.096 --> 03:12:38.137]  Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure.
[03:12:38.137 --> 03:12:39.477]  Good to talk to you.
[03:12:39.477 --> 03:12:40.798]  Yes, sir.
[03:12:40.798 --> 03:12:50.063]  Earlier, the caller called you and accused you of being a psyop, and one of the things that you said was that you were in a fighting stance, and it reminded me of something that I say to people a lot.
[03:12:50.063 --> 03:13:02.849]  When I'm talking to people about politics and or the stuff that's discussed on your show, a lot of times they are irritated or they say things like, that gives me bad energy, and they basically don't want to hear it because it bothers them.
[03:13:03.777 --> 03:13:14.303]  When I was growing up, I grew up in a taekwondo studio, and when I first started sparring, my first opponent was larger than me, and he was more aggressive than me, and he started punching me in the face.
[03:13:14.303 --> 03:13:15.364]  And I didn't like it.
[03:13:15.364 --> 03:13:18.345]  And so I looked away, and he's still punching me.
[03:13:18.345 --> 03:13:23.008]  I looked away, and my instructor heard him yell at me, don't look away, he's still hitting you.
[03:13:23.008 --> 03:13:30.652]  And I can't get that out of my head, and I learned that if there's a threat, I have to face it.
[03:13:30.652 --> 03:13:31.953]  If I look away, he's still hitting me.
[03:13:34.346 --> 03:13:35.066]  Well, that's right.
[03:13:35.066 --> 03:13:40.970]  I mean, they call it bad energy because they're kind of in a frog that's rolled over in the boiling pot and has decided to die.
[03:13:40.970 --> 03:13:45.292]  And yeah, it might hurt at first to climb out of the water before it kills you.
[03:13:45.292 --> 03:13:49.034]  But look, I'm up here three hours and 13 minutes into this show.
[03:13:49.034 --> 03:13:50.635]  I got up early this morning.
[03:13:50.635 --> 03:13:52.476]  I worked yesterday till late.
[03:13:52.476 --> 03:13:55.318]  I've dealt with incredible just B.S.
[03:13:55.318 --> 03:13:58.720]  off record in the last 48 hours.
[03:13:58.720 --> 03:14:01.341]  I was up here Saturday working, you know, seven, eight hours.
[03:14:01.341 --> 03:14:02.122]  I'm not complaining.
[03:14:03.115 --> 03:14:04.897]  I can't quit knowing what I know.
[03:14:04.897 --> 03:14:07.580]  I can't quit understanding what I understand.
[03:14:07.580 --> 03:14:10.143]  I learn more exponentially every week.
[03:14:10.143 --> 03:14:13.968]  And just like people said, oh my gosh, he got mad at Piers Morgan.
[03:14:13.968 --> 03:14:14.689]  It was discrediting.
[03:14:16.721 --> 03:14:20.983]  The Founding Fathers rode around saying, get guns and kill people, because they were coming to take our guns.
[03:14:20.983 --> 03:14:21.783]  I'm not saying that.
[03:14:21.783 --> 03:14:23.184]  More like, oh, they're heroes.
[03:14:23.184 --> 03:14:29.406]  I'm telling a red coat usurper liar, hey, you know this is about taking our guns, so stop acting like you didn't.
[03:14:29.406 --> 03:14:33.068]  You know, all the people pushing these bills want a gun ban while they're armed to the teeth.
[03:14:33.068 --> 03:14:33.608]  Watch it, buddy.
[03:14:33.608 --> 03:14:37.030]  You're going to cause a civil war, which is what the global is playing.
[03:14:37.030 --> 03:14:37.610]  So watch it.
[03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:41.011]  And then, oh, you say 9-11's an inside job.
[03:14:41.011 --> 03:14:47.933]  I'm like, I saw them on TV say they were going to blow up Building 7, and I watched them blow it up, and I got the video of it!
[03:14:47.933 --> 03:14:49.394]  Shut up, scumbag!
[03:14:49.394 --> 03:14:54.255]  I mean, stop telling me what I know is true, and stop gaslighting me!
[03:14:54.255 --> 03:14:55.476]  Stop lying to me!
[03:14:55.956 --> 03:14:56.896]  That's what the Pentagon said.
[03:14:56.896 --> 03:14:57.877]  They said it is not working.
[03:14:57.877 --> 03:14:59.778]  They're just a lie to them outright.
[03:14:59.778 --> 03:15:00.778]  We got to infiltrate them.
[03:15:00.778 --> 03:15:01.679]  We got to take them over.
[03:15:01.679 --> 03:15:06.701]  Everybody was just sitting there sick in the meeting going, we don't like to propagandize foreigners.
[03:15:06.701 --> 03:15:08.362]  We know this country is run by evil.
[03:15:08.362 --> 03:15:10.803]  Now we're going to have to engage the American people.
[03:15:10.803 --> 03:15:13.704]  I could look at that audience and tell you most of them we've got.
[03:15:13.704 --> 03:15:16.426]  Most of them look sick.
[03:15:16.426 --> 03:15:19.867]  That's where you really learned what was happening in that Pentagon briefing.
[03:15:19.867 --> 03:15:25.010]  I just want to tell the New World Order, and they know this with the NSA stuff, you people are in a bad position.
[03:15:26.277 --> 03:15:35.962]  And I know you've got all the high-tech weapons and the propaganda still, and you think you're going to control things if you control the resources, and you've wrecked most of the public mentally to where they can't fight back.
[03:15:35.962 --> 03:15:37.843]  It doesn't matter.
[03:15:37.843 --> 03:15:44.707]  If 5% of us fight back against you politically, we're going to tear your arms and legs out of their sockets like that.
[03:15:44.707 --> 03:15:48.589]  All I need is the 5% of people, and it's more like 30 that are somewhat awake, but if 5%
[03:15:50.359 --> 03:16:02.485]  of the American people, ladies and gentlemen, just start resisting, speaking out, warning others, the buzz will be so big, it will resonate psychologically with people's own survival instinct that they have, and it's over!
[03:16:02.485 --> 03:16:08.248]  Okay, people, listen, to all the people that serve the system, and you already know this, you already know now you're going to get screwed.
[03:16:08.988 --> 03:16:10.589]  You think you're going to play along with it?
[03:16:10.589 --> 03:16:11.910]  You're going to lose everything.
[03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:17.833]  The only way to beat this, and it doesn't mean you've got to go Rambo people, or you've got to find the secret and overthrow it.
[03:16:17.833 --> 03:16:20.035]  You've got to just speak out mildly.
[03:16:20.035 --> 03:16:22.036]  You've got to just say no mildly.
[03:16:22.036 --> 03:16:27.419]  You've got to just... I'm not going to even get into it.
[03:16:27.419 --> 03:16:30.080]  I've got such a headache, I'll never get to your calls if I don't.
[03:16:30.080 --> 03:16:30.441]  It's just...
[03:16:31.462 --> 03:16:34.829]  We're going to win this thing, folks, but we've all got to do a little something.
[03:16:34.829 --> 03:16:36.973]  That's what moves mountains, okay?
[03:16:36.973 --> 03:16:42.102]  Not everybody's going to do what I've done, but there will be people in this fight who will dwarf what Alex Jones has done.
[03:16:43.527 --> 03:16:47.671]  And I've always known at a spiritual level, my job is here to just send the message out.
[03:16:47.671 --> 03:16:48.692]  Who will hear?
[03:16:48.692 --> 03:16:51.254]  Who has ears to hear, eyes to see, will get it.
[03:16:51.254 --> 03:16:54.517]  And it's my job to energize the resistance.
[03:16:54.517 --> 03:16:55.739]  It's my job.
[03:16:55.739 --> 03:16:56.980]  My job is not to be your leader.
[03:16:56.980 --> 03:17:02.865]  My job is just transmit the truth, resist, resist, resist, point out the enemy operations.
[03:17:03.766 --> 03:17:07.849]  And just get people to understand what's happening and then God will do the rest, okay?
[03:17:07.849 --> 03:17:09.430]  And I think that's what you should do as well.
[03:17:09.430 --> 03:17:15.573]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to, thank you Aaron, John in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[03:17:15.573 --> 03:17:16.394]  Hello Alex.
[03:17:16.394 --> 03:17:16.994]  Hey buddy.
[03:17:16.994 --> 03:17:20.556]  Thank you very much for this time and how valuable it is.
[03:17:20.556 --> 03:17:27.701]  First off, I'd like to say that I'm calling, I'm a volunteer for the Schoolie for Congress campaign.
[03:17:27.701 --> 03:17:31.383]  The next Ron Paul is running in Pennsylvania 9th against Neocon.
[03:17:34.636 --> 03:17:43.843]  There are a lot of libertarian constitutionalist Ted Cruz types, Rand Paul types that are coming up.
[03:17:43.843 --> 03:17:44.384]  I know some of them.
[03:17:44.384 --> 03:17:46.385]  I'm planning to have some on the air.
[03:17:46.385 --> 03:17:51.309]  And absolutely, and even if they don't win in every case, they will inject real issues in those debates.
[03:17:51.309 --> 03:17:56.393]  So running for office is a great way to inject truth into the propaganda spectrum.
[03:17:58.309 --> 03:18:01.330]  For all the Infowarriors, I've been a long-time listener.
[03:18:01.330 --> 03:18:04.692]  I copy all your videos and hang them on grocery stores and markets.
[03:18:04.692 --> 03:18:07.072]  I just ran across this guy by accident.
[03:18:07.072 --> 03:18:18.717]  He was the 2008 coordinator for the Paul campaign for In the Pennsylvania Night, and he ran as an alternate delegate last year, in the last presidential election.
[03:18:18.717 --> 03:18:20.757]  He was a Ron Paul delegate.
[03:18:20.757 --> 03:18:25.179]  And what we really need is for all the Infowarriors to go to Schooley for Congress
[03:18:25.908 --> 03:18:31.810]  And I hate to beg for money on the show, Alex, but without any money, we're gonna have a hard time fighting this.
[03:18:31.810 --> 03:18:34.570]  No, I understand, but listen to me for a minute, and I appreciate your call.
[03:18:34.570 --> 03:18:35.671]  We're doing reports on this.
[03:18:35.671 --> 03:18:39.672]  The whole media structure is going after Rand Paul, Ted Cruz types.
[03:18:39.672 --> 03:18:47.914]  Democrats, Republicans, Karl Rove, Joe Biden, Chris Christie, all of them, because they're real.
[03:18:47.914 --> 03:18:52.135]  I wasn't sure about Ted Cruz being real, because I didn't know him for 15 years, like I knew Rand Paul, but he's for real.
[03:18:53.189 --> 03:18:53.910]  I don't think so.
[03:19:12.932 --> 03:19:14.793]  I mean, they just don't want to bankrupt the whole country.
[03:19:14.793 --> 03:19:21.716]  It's like Ross Perot said, and you move the jobs to India and China and Mexico, and the whole country collapses, and all it cares about is money.
[03:19:21.716 --> 03:19:24.137]  But I want my granddaughters to have a country to live in.
[03:19:24.137 --> 03:19:26.718]  Yeah, I mean, where do you think you're going to go all these other places?
[03:19:26.718 --> 03:19:31.880]  I mean, because you build an economy here, then you can build up the third world.
[03:19:31.880 --> 03:19:36.882]  You don't ship it there and lower their standard so you get to take over everything.
[03:19:36.882 --> 03:19:39.783]  I mean, it's just, it's about scorched earth globalism.
[03:19:40.862 --> 03:19:42.964]  They're using economics as a weapon, folks.
[03:19:42.964 --> 03:19:45.065]  Obama's, like, wants to get the middle class going.
[03:19:45.065 --> 03:19:48.007]  He gave a speech today, and, you know, he cares about you.
[03:19:48.007 --> 03:19:53.852]  His job is to destroy the middle class and make you dependent on record.
[03:19:53.852 --> 03:19:56.914]  Let's talk to Tex in Texas.
[03:19:56.914 --> 03:19:57.735]  Tex, you're on the air.
[03:19:57.735 --> 03:19:59.796]  Go ahead.
[03:19:59.796 --> 03:20:00.237]  Okay.
[03:20:00.237 --> 03:20:01.718]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:20:01.718 --> 03:20:04.700]  Long-time listener.
[03:20:04.700 --> 03:20:09.424]  You talked about Stonehenge when you were over in England.
[03:20:10.730 --> 03:20:11.811]  Yeah, I felt it.
[03:20:11.811 --> 03:20:15.172]  I went there because they wanted to go and I'm like, oh, look at it.
[03:20:15.172 --> 03:20:15.933]  It's so boring.
[03:20:15.933 --> 03:20:18.074]  You know, it looks small from the highway.
[03:20:18.074 --> 03:20:20.255]  And I'm walking across this line.
[03:20:20.255 --> 03:20:22.156]  It was like hit by electricity.
[03:20:22.156 --> 03:20:23.376]  I felt craved.
[03:20:23.376 --> 03:20:24.417]  Happened to everybody.
[03:20:24.417 --> 03:20:25.717]  Went back over it.
[03:20:25.717 --> 03:20:38.463]  And then the guy that was there, he said, I don't even believe in this stuff and I must not have the, you know, the cells in my brain because they've proven fish and other things, you know, can follow magnetic lines because everybody that has it, when they cross that line, they feel it.
[03:20:38.463 --> 03:20:39.604]  But go ahead and make your point.
[03:20:41.337 --> 03:20:52.741]  Okay, I was told this by my dad over 70 years ago, so that'll give you a clue, I'm an old man.
[03:20:52.741 --> 03:21:08.827]  The Earth is a globe, it's not a flat pancake, but if you take a piece of white paper and lay it on the face of the globe, using the one edge as a straight edge, and you put one edge of that paper in Boston,
[03:21:09.753 --> 03:21:16.678]  And twist the paper around so that it goes through New York, and then Philadelphia, and then Baltimore.
[03:21:16.678 --> 03:21:17.099]  No, I got it.
[03:21:17.099 --> 03:21:20.021]  You can see what on the other side of the earth is where they're at.
[03:21:20.021 --> 03:21:20.722]  Yeah, I haven't done that.
[03:21:20.722 --> 03:21:21.943]  Guys, will you hand me that glove?
[03:21:21.943 --> 03:21:23.804]  I want to see what's on the other side of Stonehenge.
[03:21:23.804 --> 03:21:24.044]  Thanks.
[03:21:24.044 --> 03:21:26.326]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:21:26.326 --> 03:21:34.232]  And you extend it down to Washington, D.C., and you extend that line, it goes back to Stonehenge.
[03:21:34.232 --> 03:21:35.233]  They knew something.
[03:21:36.034 --> 03:21:53.978]  What they knew, I don't know, but you can do it, and I don't try to prove it to you because it's... Oh no, but you're absolutely right that the ancients all believed there were certain points, and it's magnetics coming out of the earth there, and so the ancients would think it was magic, when really the birds and other things follow those lines.
[03:21:53.978 --> 03:22:01.960]  That's not been proven with science, but I mean, if you cut right through from Stonehenge in southern England, and shot right through the earth,
[03:22:04.502 --> 03:22:14.960]  Uh, I mean, it depends on what angle, but if you just went straight through, it would come out, come out, out in the ocean just south of, uh,
[03:22:16.030 --> 03:22:19.951]  Alaska, looks like, or, you know, let me see.
[03:22:19.951 --> 03:22:25.994]  Come out over here, about 500, 600, 700 miles south of Alaska, it looks like.
[03:22:25.994 --> 03:22:29.135]  But I guess, I mean, I guess you could underground have some line.
[03:22:29.135 --> 03:22:32.216]  I know they have ley lines, too, and I guess those, I mean, they say D.C.
[03:22:32.216 --> 03:22:33.716]  is on a ley line, but I think it's a different one.
[03:22:33.716 --> 03:22:37.958]  And I don't even know if those ley lines are real, it was just the ancients trying to map it.
[03:22:37.958 --> 03:22:42.619]  I mean, again, I just know that I'm like, all right, let's get over here and get back to London.
[03:22:42.619 --> 03:22:43.840]  Yeah, it's pretty neat, you know, I'm like,
[03:22:44.696 --> 03:22:47.839]  And I'm just walking all of a sudden, and it's like, whoa, do you feel that?
[03:22:47.839 --> 03:22:49.200]  Leon Magadu felt it.
[03:22:49.200 --> 03:22:50.041]  Watson felt it.
[03:22:50.041 --> 03:22:53.484]  His wife, Ihan, felt it.
[03:22:53.484 --> 03:22:58.288]  And I mean, I felt like I was 18 and was about to get in a fight with somebody.
[03:22:58.288 --> 03:22:59.209]  I mean, I'm not even angry.
[03:22:59.209 --> 03:23:02.392]  I felt electrified and crazed.
[03:23:02.392 --> 03:23:03.773]  And so the ancients didn't know what it was.
[03:23:03.773 --> 03:23:05.835]  They thought, oh, my gosh, it's Oonga Boonga or whatever.
[03:23:05.835 --> 03:23:08.397]  But I believe it's a magnetic vortex.
[03:23:08.397 --> 03:23:09.659]  But it wasn't just at Stonehenge.
[03:23:10.452 --> 03:23:14.954]  Because I felt something around, it's this, I mean, you would pass about a 10 foot wide line.
[03:23:14.954 --> 03:23:17.675]  And I walked through it, and later said, do you guys feel anything?
[03:23:17.675 --> 03:23:18.915]  And they're like, yeah, back there.
[03:23:18.915 --> 03:23:19.856]  And we're like, yeah.
[03:23:19.856 --> 03:23:35.982]  So we go back over it, and it was like going over a, you know, on a roller coaster when your stomach goes up, and you feel, what's that called when you, you know, go down a hill real fast, and you feel your stomach come up into your chest?
[03:23:35.982 --> 03:23:37.803]  I mean, there's a reason the ancients built
[03:23:39.184 --> 03:23:42.487]  Stone circles all over the world on certain sites.
[03:23:42.487 --> 03:23:46.950]  And it's because there's something magnetic coming out of the ground there.
[03:23:46.950 --> 03:23:51.433]  And of course we know at the Northern South Pole there's massive electromagnetic stuff coming out.
[03:23:51.433 --> 03:23:56.777]  And they have measured higher electromagnetics coming out of that magnetic rock there.
[03:23:56.777 --> 03:23:57.638]  But anything else, sir?
[03:23:59.502 --> 03:24:03.543]  Well, that was that on Stonehenge.
[03:24:03.543 --> 03:24:06.283]  I just wondered if they told you anything about it.
[03:24:06.283 --> 03:24:08.184]  They knew something.
[03:24:08.184 --> 03:24:10.744]  They selected Washington, D.C.
[03:24:10.744 --> 03:24:13.785]  specifically to be on this line.
[03:24:13.785 --> 03:24:14.785]  It just didn't happen.
[03:24:14.785 --> 03:24:23.566]  I had ancestors that had property there that eventually were taken into the Washington, D.C.
[03:24:23.566 --> 03:24:24.306]  area.
[03:24:24.306 --> 03:24:27.727]  Second thing is the royal family of England.
[03:24:28.368 --> 03:24:30.549]  Second subject.
[03:24:30.549 --> 03:24:31.489]  Do I have time for this?
[03:24:31.489 --> 03:24:33.690]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:24:33.690 --> 03:24:34.910]  Okay.
[03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:51.235]  I listened to you with glee that you and Tex were not upset talking to each other because this book he referred to, I don't know whether you've read it, Kessler's book on the 13th tribe.
[03:24:51.235 --> 03:24:53.196]  Are you familiar with that subject matter?
[03:24:53.196 --> 03:24:53.816]  Yes.
[03:24:53.816 --> 03:24:54.656]  Yes.
[03:24:54.656 --> 03:24:56.437]  Okay.
[03:24:58.587 --> 03:25:03.870]  Well, evidently the author of that's name, Kessler, he did not know this.
[03:25:03.870 --> 03:25:06.792]  I don't know that Tex knows this.
[03:25:06.792 --> 03:25:09.894]  And I've seen it on just one place.
[03:25:09.894 --> 03:25:14.797]  But there was a part of the Ashkenazi Jews.
[03:25:14.797 --> 03:25:17.039]  His name was King Joseph.
[03:25:18.101 --> 03:25:20.542]  He went to Ireland.
[03:25:20.542 --> 03:25:24.223]  He did not disappear from history like he generally thought.
[03:25:24.223 --> 03:25:32.925]  No, no, they got the Stone of Destiny from Ireland, then it went to England, and then why is it in Scotland now?
[03:25:32.925 --> 03:25:34.345]  I'm not talking about that.
[03:25:34.345 --> 03:25:35.006]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:25:35.006 --> 03:25:38.747]  There is a reason, but I did want to sidetrack from that.
[03:25:38.747 --> 03:25:43.728]  There was a lot of intermarriage from the Khazar
[03:25:44.768 --> 03:25:49.692]  on Ashkenazi Jews into the Royal Family of England.
[03:25:49.692 --> 03:25:50.573]  That's the point I want to make.
[03:25:50.573 --> 03:25:56.077]  Well, the Royal Family says that they do trace some of their lineage back to King David.
[03:25:56.077 --> 03:25:57.078]  I mean, they say that.
[03:25:57.078 --> 03:26:00.380]  It's British Israelism, I think you call it.
[03:26:00.380 --> 03:26:04.824]  I think it predates even Israel being set up, and it's been going on for thousands of years.
[03:26:04.824 --> 03:26:07.306]  And that's kind of what the whole Merovingian bloodline is.
[03:26:07.306 --> 03:26:08.547]  They claim to go back to Jesus,
[03:26:09.167 --> 03:26:15.152]  And that's the Illuminati's big secret, is that the royal family is reportedly related to Jesus.
[03:26:15.152 --> 03:26:18.955]  And of course, the Bible says Jesus didn't have any children, but they say that's the big secret.
[03:26:18.955 --> 03:26:24.199]  That's the Holy Grail that they hide, is that the royal bloodline of Christ.
[03:26:24.199 --> 03:26:33.587]  And whether that's true or not, the Transylvanian bloodline that became one of the dominant German bloodlines is directly linked into the House of Windsor.
[03:26:33.587 --> 03:26:38.651]  It's not really even the... It's like Mombatten, Coburg, Gotha, there's like 15 names.
[03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:43.055]  And the truth is, it's just a whole bunch of old royal families of Europe.
[03:26:43.055 --> 03:26:48.823]  I mean, they are Gaelic, they're Germanic, they're undoubtedly there's some Middle Eastern in there.
[03:26:48.823 --> 03:26:54.991]  But the reason the Romanians, the Transylvanians got so rich was they kept getting paid to hold back the Muslims.
[03:26:55.942 --> 03:27:02.085]  And so that's why those folks didn't move back into Germania and intermarry with the other royalty there.
[03:27:02.085 --> 03:27:04.066]  But I mean, it's a Heinz 57.
[03:27:04.066 --> 03:27:10.450]  That's like the Rothschilds are intermarried into the royal bloodlines.
[03:27:12.068 --> 03:27:20.154]  So, when I say a German royal family or German death cult, it's really an Illuminati death cult, and that stuff goes back, you know, to Egypt.
[03:27:20.154 --> 03:27:25.418]  It's a Babylon mystery school, and people take that out of context, but it's very interesting, sir.
[03:27:25.418 --> 03:27:26.819]  I appreciate your call.
[03:27:26.819 --> 03:27:28.720]  By the way, let me just plug something here.

[03:29:25.153 --> 03:29:27.254]  If you can get in tomorrow, I'll put you to the head of the line.
[03:29:27.254 --> 03:29:28.396]  I'm exhausted today.

[03:29:30.316 --> 03:29:31.457]  I've got to stop now.
[03:29:31.457 --> 03:29:32.497]  I get dingy.
[03:29:32.497 --> 03:29:34.077]  I start talking fast.
[03:29:34.077 --> 03:29:35.137]  And I just shouldn't be on radio.
[03:29:35.137 --> 03:29:36.538]  I need to go rest for about 30 minutes.
[03:29:36.538 --> 03:29:42.299]  I've got a bunch of work to do here with the Obama Deception 2, the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:29:42.299 --> 03:29:43.059]  But we love you all.

[03:29:49.600 --> 03:29:50.661]  Our ancestors did it.
[03:29:50.661 --> 03:29:53.541]  We can do it with God's help.
[03:29:53.541 --> 03:29:54.922]  We're on the march.
[03:29:54.922 --> 03:29:56.442]  The empire's on the run.
