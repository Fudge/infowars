[00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:05.472]  Welcome back.
[00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:25.442]  This is an extra bonus section that we're going to feature for PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers and tonight we're actually going to go more in depth on the information about RFIDs that I just presented to you with Dr. Katherine Albrecht about the reality of this coming electronic security state, electronic concentration camp that they're trying to accustom all of our children to here
[00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:26.122]  I think so.
[00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:58.291]  An interview that was done with the Hernandez family, including Andrea Hernandez, who was the student that did speak out and say on religious grounds she did not want to take this mark, she did not want to wear this chip, and she's since been expelled.
[00:00:58.652 --> 00:01:08.098]  But it's still interesting to look at what she has to say and look into a view of what our future holds in store when they try to mark all of our children with these terrifying RFID chips.
[00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:14.179]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:27.223]  Although we have all been conditioned to accept that technology will be spying on us all the time in this police state control grid we now find ourselves living in, families here in San Antonio, Texas are standing up against this intrusion on their privacy and freedom.
[00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:34.166]  Protesting the RFID tracking chips the school district here is forcing students to wear just so that they can attend school.
[00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:37.647]  Mr. Hernandez, why did you organize this protest here today?
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.284]  Well, the reason I organized this is because I'm protesting these RFID tracking chips.
[00:01:42.764 --> 00:01:43.985]  The children don't need to be tracked.
[00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:48.409]  You know, and it steps on my religious freedom and the religious freedom of my children and my family.
[00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:51.052]  Then there's other things you can look at.
[00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:52.853]  Civil liberties, rights, privacy.
[00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:57.277]  All these things, they didn't take into account when they implemented this program.
[00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:00.200]  And for us, first and foremost, it's our religious freedom.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.442]  That's our fight, and they're trying to take it away from us.
[00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:09.712]  And you told me just a second ago that your daughter has actually been threatened with recourse by the schools for this protest?
[00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:10.732]  Yes ma'am.
[00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:15.034]  What they told me on the 20th of September, they offered us a compromise.
[00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:19.036]  And the compromise was that they would allow her to wear a bag that didn't have a chip in it.
[00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:24.078]  But she had to fall in line like the rest of them and show support for the program.
[00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.900]  So the Constitution ends once students step foot on school property?
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.401]  Pretty much for them, yes ma'am it does.
[00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.395]  Why do you feel that wearing the RFID chips is a bad thing?
[00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:36.276]  Well, I feel it's an invasion of my religious beliefs.
[00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:38.377]  I feel that it's the implementation of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:02:39.438 --> 00:02:44.980]  I feel that it's an invasion of my privacy and it's an invasion of all my rights as a citizen.
[00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.270]  Does this in any way make you feel safer?
[00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.391]  No, it doesn't.
[00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:58.676]  It actually bothers me a whole lot and I feel completely unsafe knowing that this is going to be hacked by pedophiles and dangerous offenders that live around my area because I walk home.
[00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:02.518]  Dangerous offenders can pick up on my signal and, you know, anybody.
[00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:04.339]  My name is John Henry Liberty.
[00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.980]  I'm a congressional candidate for U.S.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.161]  House of Representatives, District 21 of Texas.
[00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.143]  And why did you attend this protest on RFID tracking chips today?
[00:03:12.728 --> 00:03:14.310]  Because I find the program to be abhorrent.
[00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.134]  This is a textbook case of Orwellian authoritarianism in action.
[00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:25.840]  Tracking our children is not going to solve the problem that they want it to solve, and it's just going to cost us $500,000.
[00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:31.105]  They say it's cost neutral, but really this still costs us $500,000, and then $136,000 annually to keep it up.
[00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:32.247]  And this is money that's allocated for education.
[00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:38.352]  Don't chip me bro!
[00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:39.873]  Don't chip me bro!
[00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:49.372]  When protesters decided to take their concerns inside, the school board attempted to silence them.
[00:03:50.012 --> 00:03:54.013]  The RFID chip issue was not even an included item on the night's agenda.
[00:03:54.493 --> 00:04:03.035]  And although many community members turned up to voice their concerns, the board would only allow five people to speak on the issue for only three minutes apiece.
[00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:08.596]  The board may not provide a public forum for every citizen wishing to express an opinion on a matter.
[00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:10.656]  It is my
[00:04:12.744 --> 00:04:21.027]  They don't want to hear from us because they know that we're right.
[00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:24.089]  This is absurd and we're going to fight them now more than ever.
[00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:26.170]  You want to talk about history?
[00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.651]  We know that the Jews were tattooed during the Holocaust.
[00:04:29.812 --> 00:04:30.852]  What are you doing here?
[00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:39.496]  I think that until we have a health impact study that determines that it is safe for our children, we should not be subjecting them to experimental technology.
[00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:43.234]  Everything about this screams Orwellian authoritarianism.
[00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:46.036]  It is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:48.598]  It is a violation of these students' rights to privacy.
[00:04:49.258 --> 00:04:49.999]  Bottom line is this.
[00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.241]  My daughter has rights, okay?
[00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:55.823]  You can't reinstate rights to her that she already has.
[00:04:56.844 --> 00:04:57.564]  She has rights.
[00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:03.609]  None of you up here can ask us to give up our religious freedom.
[00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:11.154]  Finally, and most importantly, is the disgusting abuse of power resulting in the violation of these students' religious freedom.
[00:05:11.174 --> 00:05:12.435]  And it's not just Andrea.
[00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:22.644]  This program and the expressed consequences with not falling in line with it have created a chilling effect in the students in these schools and making them afraid to stand up for themselves.
[00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.590]  What they're doing to the people is wrong.
[00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:25.891]  And you know what?
[00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:27.292]  Now I'm going to fight even harder.
[00:05:27.312 --> 00:05:29.373]  And you're going to see my face postured everywhere.
[00:05:29.713 --> 00:05:33.176]  I'm going to come at them like a bull in a glass china shop.
[00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:34.256]  I'm coming at them now.
[00:05:34.497 --> 00:05:36.098]  They're going to regret what they just did to us.
[00:05:38.314 --> 00:05:51.918]  In a time more and more when we're being tracked, traced, and controlled at our every step, organizations such as schools are using children as test subjects for these RFID programs because they know they're easy targets for police state control conditioning.
[00:05:52.558 --> 00:06:02.101]  But as the parents you saw here today at this protest, we need to stand up against this and stand up for our freedom and our rights to liberty before we don't have any freedom left.
[00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:05.282]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:06:05.993 --> 00:06:14.344]  I really like to see more parents come down, more students come down and fight this, because this is something that's going to affect not just these school districts, but all school districts in Texas.
[00:06:14.704 --> 00:06:20.772]  This is setting a precedence that is acceptable to treat children like cattle, and that just cannot stand.
[00:06:24.332 --> 00:06:31.436]  We are back on the InfoWars Nightly News and we're going to deal now with an issue that is so important for the future of humanity.
[00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:45.804]  It is so central to the reason this country was founded, the basic ideas of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, of religious freedom, of being an individual in an age where we've been conditioned to accept technology creeping up on us.
[00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:46.745]  We're always
[00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:58.931]  Wowed and amazed and wooed by the new cool things technology can do, and we're always just trained to ignore the fact that it's converging on a point of tracking us in a total control grid.
[00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.573]  Every piece of technology is leading up to this.
[00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:02.613]  It's integrating.
[00:07:03.113 --> 00:07:10.217]  This kind of technology started with the adoption of social security numbers and other IDs, but it is now at the point of total high-tech.
[00:07:10.557 --> 00:07:13.739]  It's being pushed on school kids, other vulnerable groups,
[00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:21.004]  People who haven't reached the age of consent, who don't yet have the wisdom to say no to this, but one family is saying no.
[00:07:21.044 --> 00:07:23.946]  We need so many more families to join them in that fight.
[00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:26.547]  We are joined now by the Hernandez family.
[00:07:26.848 --> 00:07:35.573]  They're in San Antonio saying no to the school that wants them to mandatorily wear an ID badge with an RFID tracker inside of it.
[00:07:35.874 --> 00:07:36.754]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:07:37.194 --> 00:07:42.718]  Steve, the father, Andrea at school there, and John Jay, and of course your son as well.
[00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:43.719]  Thanks for coming in.
[00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:45.200]  Yes sir, thank you, I appreciate it.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:55.809]  So tell us about the specific program that's being introduced and some of the major issues going on in San Antonio, which by the way is being rolled out all across Texas and all across the nation.
[00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:59.552]  Right now it's kind of in tester, beta programs, but they want to expand it.
[00:07:59.752 --> 00:08:01.073]  Oh absolutely, absolutely.
[00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:03.235]  This program is
[00:08:04.176 --> 00:08:10.540]  Being implemented at John Jay High School and Anson Jones Middle School, the only two schools with the lowest attendance rate in the city.
[00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.982]  They're putting RFID tracking chips under kids' badges.
[00:08:15.022 --> 00:08:16.243]  They want to make it mandatory.
[00:08:17.344 --> 00:08:21.206]  And they want to make the rest of the school district pick it up.
[00:08:21.586 --> 00:08:23.387]  And there's 112 schools in that school district.
[00:08:24.031 --> 00:08:26.973]  So they're starting with two, but it's going to 112 schools?
[00:08:27.053 --> 00:08:27.713]  Absolutely, yes sir.
[00:08:27.733 --> 00:08:28.593]  Just in San Antonio?
[00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:31.255]  Just in San Antonio, just in the NISD school district.
[00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:34.136]  They're making it mandatory that the kids have to wear it.
[00:08:35.197 --> 00:08:38.639]  If not, they cannot participate in certain programs at school.
[00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:45.122]  They cannot get their lunch or check out library books if they don't wear these badges.
[00:08:45.928 --> 00:08:49.989]  And we stood up and said, no, absolutely not, because we felt like it stepped on our religious freedom.
[00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:50.749]  Right.
[00:08:50.989 --> 00:09:03.852]  And when we got back into town, we got this letter from the NISD board saying that on August 10th, that this is when this letter was dated, that the kids would start wearing these badges.
[00:09:03.952 --> 00:09:11.053]  And they sent it out really close to the day that the kids had to go get their badges and register for school, because they didn't want any arguments.
[00:09:11.413 --> 00:09:12.873]  They didn't want anybody to resist it.
[00:09:13.614 --> 00:09:15.474]  But unfortunately for them,
[00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.332]  I resisted, and I went on my local news station and I said, no, my daughter will not wear this badge.
[00:09:21.753 --> 00:09:28.356]  They had already done a story and said, hey, we want to talk to you more about it, and now we are here today with you on your show to speak more about this.
[00:09:28.416 --> 00:09:33.659]  And we do have a clip from that news piece, so let's go to that right now and then we'll come back and enlarge the discussion.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:45.927]  Starting tomorrow, about 4,000 students at John Jay High School and Anson Jones Middle School must wear a new and controversial photo ID called the Radio Frequency Identification System.
[00:09:46.307 --> 00:09:48.168]  It tracks students while they're on campus.
[00:09:48.528 --> 00:09:49.989]  Some call it a spy chip.
[00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:52.410]  Andrea says many students just won't wear it.
[00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.892]  I know that there's kids who are, hey man, can you hold this?
[00:09:54.992 --> 00:09:56.273]  I'm gonna go across the street to go get tacos.
[00:09:56.293 --> 00:09:59.115]  She said others might stick it in a locker to avoid monitoring.
[00:09:59.195 --> 00:10:01.396]  The NISD is a school district, they're not a government.
[00:10:02.865 --> 00:10:03.966]  And so there is that.
[00:10:03.986 --> 00:10:05.828]  There's of course more up on the websites.
[00:10:06.468 --> 00:10:12.994]  But Steve, Andrea, what's been the reaction to that news piece, and what are people saying about the fact that you don't want to go along with this system?
[00:10:13.314 --> 00:10:18.038]  A lot of people are just like, oh you're just whining, oh you're just complaining, you just want to fit the attention.
[00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:20.341]  I was like, no this is, you know, this is wrong.
[00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:22.522]  Northside does not have the right to do this to us.
[00:10:22.582 --> 00:10:24.864]  And they're just like, oh just wear the badge, you know, it's just a badge.
[00:10:24.885 --> 00:10:28.448]  I was like, no, this is a lot bigger than just a badge, and it's a lot more than that as well.
[00:10:29.757 --> 00:10:31.479]  It really is, and Steve?
[00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:36.843]  You know, I had a guy at work actually tell me I was just exploiting this for my own benefit.
[00:10:38.044 --> 00:10:40.146]  I don't see how that could be, because I'm not getting paid for this.
[00:10:41.387 --> 00:10:42.268]  What am I exploiting?
[00:10:43.008 --> 00:10:46.151]  What I'm trying to exploit here is the injustice of this school district.
[00:10:46.691 --> 00:10:50.775]  This school district sits here and believes that they can mandate
[00:10:51.414 --> 00:10:54.435]  To parents and students and teachers, what they can and cannot do.
[00:10:55.096 --> 00:11:01.758]  I've been watching it for the last seven, eight years that I've been back in San Antonio, and I've had to go up against the school district several times on different issues.
[00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:06.700]  They literally believe what they say is gold, it's solid, and you must do it.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.081]  If not, you're done.
[00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:10.182]  You better do as they say.
[00:11:10.222 --> 00:11:12.863]  They really want to usurp the rights of parents, among other things.
[00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:20.366]  But you've seen stories in the past few years, it's been leading up, different school districts across the country where they want you to thumbprint for a lunch.
[00:11:20.766 --> 00:11:21.106]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:50.285 --> 00:12:08.752]  They say these chips can't be tracked except for inside the school and Wade Garcia, who actually implemented all of this into both of those schools, has come on radio publicly and said, hey, you know, we had to wait several years to get the previous superintendent out so that we get this new guy in there and he'll go ahead and prove it.
[00:12:08.772 --> 00:12:10.032]  I mean, he's admitted to it.
[00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:13.653]  That this has been in plan for about the last two years, several years.
[00:12:14.373 --> 00:12:15.714]  So he also states that
[00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:17.690]  Hey, these things never shut off.
[00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.811]  They always emit a signal.
[00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:23.714]  And you know, if they're always emitting a signal, that means anybody with an RFID tracker...
[00:12:24.428 --> 00:12:25.468]  Can I actually pull up your information?
[00:12:25.488 --> 00:12:27.829]  Anybody with basic computer knowledge can actually pull this up.
[00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.950]  Yeah, it's true.
[00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.692]  They're very easy to hack and that means sexual predators are going to be hacking.
[00:12:32.732 --> 00:12:41.575]  That means lawless authorities, people abusing their power are going to be hacking the systems, probably with a ready-to-go index of students and teachers and everyone else.
[00:12:41.655 --> 00:12:49.919]  It's total inventory control, open season for people who are predators, wolves inside a system of people who are still sheeps, people who aren't grown up yet.
[00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:52.020]  It would be bad enough to do it to adults.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:52.941]  Absolutely.
[00:12:53.421 --> 00:13:03.949]  And what they don't seem to understand, they're stepping on civil liberties, religious freedom, and these children who aren't old enough to make decisions for their own, they're being conditioned and told, you have to do it this way.
[00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:09.533]  So what they're doing is taking the voices away from the children, away from the parents, even teachers.
[00:13:09.733 --> 00:13:12.635]  I know some teachers are afraid to stand up because they don't want to lose their jobs.
[00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:13.386]  Yeah.
[00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:15.387]  They're taking away the voice of the people.
[00:13:15.867 --> 00:13:16.667]  But guess what?
[00:13:16.808 --> 00:13:18.328]  I'm here for the voice of the people.
[00:13:18.808 --> 00:13:23.771]  And even for those who disagree with me, I'm fighting for you, your children, your families.
[00:13:23.811 --> 00:13:26.132]  Not just for my two children and my family.
[00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:29.093]  I'm fighting for every person out there.
[00:13:29.953 --> 00:13:31.594]  I've been misquoted several times saying that
[00:13:32.566 --> 00:13:34.907]  I said this is the Mark of the Beast and all this fun stuff.
[00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:36.528]  I didn't say it was the Mark of the Beast.
[00:13:36.588 --> 00:13:38.069]  I said this is how they condition the people.
[00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:38.790]  Okay?
[00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.150]  But there's a correlation there.
[00:13:40.531 --> 00:13:40.831]  Oh yeah?
[00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:48.635]  Because in the Bible it says you can't buy, sell, you can't participate pretty much in the economy if you don't have the Mark of the Beast.
[00:13:49.176 --> 00:13:49.576]  But guess what?
[00:13:49.776 --> 00:13:55.479]  In that school, they're being told, hey, you can't buy your lunch unless you have this badge.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.281]  You can't get your library books unless you have this badge.
[00:13:59.221 --> 00:14:00.122]  Sounds very similar to me.
[00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:02.561]  It was extremely prescient.
[00:14:02.621 --> 00:14:06.542]  People like to discount Bible prophecy, but it's so strongly worded.
[00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:08.542]  Everyone knows about that passage.
[00:14:08.562 --> 00:14:09.583]  You can read it if you want.
[00:14:10.023 --> 00:14:11.383]  How did they know that was coming?
[00:14:11.863 --> 00:14:16.724]  Doesn't matter if it's just dictators, if it's just men on earth and not devils running things.
[00:14:16.764 --> 00:14:18.484]  They've still gone with the same plan.
[00:14:18.504 --> 00:14:19.784]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:20.204 --> 00:14:24.405]  I mean, if the Bible wasn't true, I wouldn't be sitting here today with you.
[00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:25.665]  I just made it simple.
[00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:28.946]  If it wasn't in there, it wasn't written,
[00:14:30.091 --> 00:14:33.692]  I was 5 years old when my parents started teaching me the Bible and taking me to church.
[00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:48.157]  Now imagine if you will, 11 o'clock at night, you're 5 years old, you can barely keep your eyes open, your dad has you down on the carpet talking and reading you the Bible, and he starts talking about the Mark of the Beast, talking to you about these little chips they want to put in your size of a grain of rice.
[00:14:48.817 --> 00:14:51.138]  You don't know what to think, you're a child.
[00:14:51.898 --> 00:14:57.560]  But here I am, 42 years old, 37 years later, all of a sudden I find myself in the middle of it.
[00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:02.021]  I'm in the middle of it and I gotta take care of my children.
[00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:07.344]  It is my responsibility as a parent to take care of my family.
[00:15:07.464 --> 00:15:09.626]  My wife, my son, my daughter.
[00:15:09.646 --> 00:15:12.628]  I have to stand up and protect them.
[00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:14.649]  And this is exactly what I'm doing today.
[00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:17.211]  I'm standing up to protect my wife and my children.
[00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:19.292]  And I'm not going to allow this to happen.
[00:15:19.332 --> 00:15:22.114]  We are not going to compromise our faith for NISD.
[00:15:22.374 --> 00:15:23.835]  We're not going to compromise for the government.
[00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:25.096]  We're just not going to do it.
[00:15:25.632 --> 00:15:30.794]  Well, why will they make certain provisions for religious reasons for extreme minorities?
[00:15:30.814 --> 00:15:33.215]  And those people should have the right to religious freedom.
[00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:36.597]  It's, you know, part of the tradition of this country and it makes sense anyway.
[00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:43.840]  But why will they run wholesale over huge blocks of Christians and just completely ignore a very well-known provision?
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.601]  I mean, that is a line in the sand for so many people.
[00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:54.765]  The RFID chip, the Mark of the Beast, whatever you see it as, maybe some future technology still coming, but it's all headed in the same direction of control.
[00:15:55.265 --> 00:15:57.447]  And really, disrespect for human individuals.
[00:15:58.127 --> 00:16:08.615]  Yeah, there is a disrespect, and the reason they run over the Christians is because they know if they can squash the Christians, and they can squash God's Word, they can take over the world and do what they want to do.
[00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:11.557]  But unfortunately for them, the book has already been written.
[00:16:12.518 --> 00:16:13.739]  God wins, okay?
[00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:15.060]  The Christian people win.
[00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:19.584]  So they can try as they might, but it's just not going to work out for them.
[00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:23.927]  You know, I would rather be on the side of the Lord
[00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:28.078]  And reap my rewards in Heaven and reap my rewards here on Earth.
[00:16:29.859 --> 00:16:31.359]  There's more to this.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.761]  And I've had the opportunity to witness to people and talk to people the last several weeks, get people saved.
[00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:40.803]  I believe that God has chosen us to help to fight this.
[00:16:41.443 --> 00:16:42.463]  I mean, who would ever think?
[00:16:42.663 --> 00:16:46.064]  I went on television to my local news station and said, no, we're not going to do this.
[00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:47.485]  And here I am today.
[00:16:48.514 --> 00:16:51.476]  Two, three protests later, visits with the NISD.
[00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:55.337]  I have all kinds of organizations and people from around the world gathering behind us.
[00:16:56.778 --> 00:17:00.680]  Who would think one man stood up and made that big of a difference?
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.181]  And then, why did I stand up?
[00:17:03.241 --> 00:17:05.902]  Because my daughter told me that I'm not going to wear it.
[00:17:06.703 --> 00:17:07.563]  I am not going to wear it.
[00:17:08.464 --> 00:17:09.024]  And she's right.
[00:17:09.104 --> 00:17:09.864]  She doesn't have to.
[00:17:10.365 --> 00:17:15.207]  I mean, she can tell you things that have been going on in the school, that the teachers have been telling the students.
[00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:17.289]  About wearing the badge.
[00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:18.690]  It's absolutely absurd.
[00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:24.293]  And you were talking earlier, Andrea, about how you're not a product.
[00:17:24.313 --> 00:17:27.875]  You've got an image on one of your binders at school about, I am not a product.
[00:17:27.935 --> 00:17:33.598]  But this is exactly what they're trying to do, is treat us as human cattle, as we're part of an inventory system.
[00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:38.801]  The way they're tracking boxes that come from Walmart and go to stores across the country and everything.
[00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:40.082]  But we're human beings.
[00:17:40.342 --> 00:17:40.802]  Exactly.
[00:17:41.203 --> 00:17:42.704]  And that's what Northside seems to forget.
[00:17:42.744 --> 00:17:44.045]  They think that we're just money.
[00:17:44.065 --> 00:17:45.367]  We're just cattle.
[00:17:45.927 --> 00:17:47.589]  They don't think of us as a person.
[00:17:48.009 --> 00:17:50.371]  They just think that, oh, they're just more money for our pocket.
[00:17:50.391 --> 00:17:51.532]  They're just more money for the budget.
[00:17:51.893 --> 00:17:58.359]  But they don't realize that, you know, yes, they have a budget, and yes, they have money, but it's supposed to be for the students.
[00:17:58.419 --> 00:18:02.923]  It's supposed to be for the fine arts, for the athletics, for the teachers, not for their own personal gain.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.881]  Yeah, but they always seem to have funding for these high technology control systems.
[00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:08.221]  Yeah.
[00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:11.842]  But, you know, then they have to cut the arts, they have to cut the sports programs.
[00:18:12.263 --> 00:18:12.783]  Absolutely.
[00:18:12.803 --> 00:18:20.505]  You know, Northside just, oh, we don't have any money to do anything, we don't have any money for our teachers, so let's let go all of our teachers, but let's bring in these new chips.
[00:18:21.405 --> 00:18:25.587]  That kind of, you know, we're not supposed to have any money, but yet we have enough money for this tracking program.
[00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.747]  And then this is just the beginning, you know.
[00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:32.649]  There's 110 more schools that have to get this chip as well if we don't stop it here and now.
[00:18:33.547 --> 00:18:37.269]  Yeah, and I want to talk specifically about fighting back, because it does make a big difference.
[00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:44.932]  On the RFID front, they've already moved to chip most pets in many cities, trying to put forward the idea that that's somehow mandatory.
[00:18:45.413 --> 00:18:52.976]  People have, on the other hand, fought back against that, because the microchips have been found to cause cancer in pets and animals, and nobody wants to see that.
[00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:56.438]  But the fact that people have protested against that issue has really hurt
[00:18:56.838 --> 00:19:02.461]  The main company is putting out the RFID technology, so they can suffer from us speaking back.
[00:19:02.522 --> 00:19:05.323]  It's a consumer issue, but it's also a rights issue.
[00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:11.087]  And parental rights, your rights as a member of a public school, that all factors into that.
[00:19:11.107 --> 00:19:16.390]  So let's talk about how we can fight back and how do we get other people out there with you helping on this issue.
[00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.911]  Well, what we've been trying to do, we actually go out and we talk with people and let people know.
[00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:24.253]  But, you know, people can go to spychips.com and read about it.
[00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:28.654]  All of our protests, all the pictures that we have up there are, you know, they're going there.
[00:19:28.694 --> 00:19:29.354]  We have videos.
[00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:38.077]  We actually have a video that was released of our, of everybody talking to the NISD Board of Trustees.
[00:19:40.038 --> 00:19:43.879]  Karen Freeman from NISD said that, hey, you know, we can listen to you, but it doesn't mean we have to act on it.
[00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.791]  That tells me, hey, she wants to stay on her grind.
[00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:55.617]  But guess what, you know, we have a group of 20 million strong behind us and all kinds of different organizations throughout the world, people from all over the place.
[00:19:56.597 --> 00:20:00.320]  Like Katherine Albrecht told me, you put a little bit of fire underneath them, they're going to stop.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.241]  So let's light this fire.
[00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:02.191]  Okay.
[00:20:02.812 --> 00:20:06.154]  I have to give my hats off, my thanks to Katherine Albrecht, Katie Deloitte.
[00:20:06.194 --> 00:20:10.616]  Yeah, she's done a lot of very good work on this, and she has put pressure on specific companies.
[00:20:11.237 --> 00:20:14.019]  She's followed them, and she could do the same for these public institutions.
[00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:14.539]  Absolutely.
[00:20:14.579 --> 00:20:15.800]  Liz McIntyre, all of them.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:24.085]  They have single-handedly put them back by at least ten years by all these protests that they've been doing throughout the United States and England and all over the world.
[00:20:24.685 --> 00:20:26.366]  You know, and I'm proud to be part of that.
[00:20:27.047 --> 00:20:28.628]  And, you know, these people
[00:20:29.485 --> 00:20:30.365]  You need to understand.
[00:20:30.465 --> 00:20:35.326]  You cannot mandate to a free society what people have to do.
[00:20:35.366 --> 00:20:38.227]  You cannot just say, hey, you're going to wear it and you're going to like it.
[00:20:38.887 --> 00:20:39.207]  You can't.
[00:20:39.307 --> 00:20:41.688]  We are the United States of America.
[00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:42.628]  We are a free nation.
[00:20:42.648 --> 00:20:43.768]  We're supposed to be a free nation.
[00:20:44.389 --> 00:20:47.229]  We are not United States of Northside Independent School District.
[00:20:48.109 --> 00:20:49.110]  They are not a government.
[00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.570]  And even if they were a government, they cannot tell us we have to wear chips.
[00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:54.791]  That they can track us anytime they like.
[00:20:55.411 --> 00:20:59.012]  It's enough that they're tracking us with our credit cards, our cell phones, our phone bills.
[00:21:00.165 --> 00:21:01.346]  There's some things you can't get around.
[00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:02.546]  But this, I can get around.
[00:21:02.566 --> 00:21:04.167]  This, I would say no to.
[00:21:04.688 --> 00:21:06.269]  My daughter's not going to wear this badge.
[00:21:07.569 --> 00:21:08.630]  This badge was okay.
[00:21:09.991 --> 00:21:13.893]  Even though it has barcodes on it and it has a little scanty thingamabob on the back.
[00:21:14.293 --> 00:21:15.174]  But this one is no good.
[00:21:15.214 --> 00:21:15.674]  I don't like it.
[00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:18.256]  It has two batteries and it has a chip right here.
[00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:20.897]  It never turns off.
[00:21:21.998 --> 00:21:24.859]  And with that being said, she will never wear it.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.242]  My son will not wear it when and if it comes to his school.
[00:21:29.943 --> 00:21:34.866]  I mean, we're talking about the privacy concerns, which are the big things, but there's also the environmental pollution.
[00:21:34.906 --> 00:21:39.128]  Are these devices safe to even wear next to the heart and different parts of the body?
[00:21:39.168 --> 00:21:43.711]  There's been a lot of stuff brought out on different Wi-Fi signals, and this is becoming a problem.
[00:21:44.191 --> 00:21:46.032]  Yeah, it emits a radiation cloud around the body.
[00:21:46.892 --> 00:21:49.814]  Up to 70 feet in diameter, I believe they were saying.
[00:21:50.994 --> 00:21:54.837]  So anybody can drive by with an RFID scanner and get your information.
[00:21:56.696 --> 00:22:05.418]  Northside Independent School District likes to say, hey, you know, in their paperwork here it says, you know, you can't scan it outside the school district, outside the school, the four walls of the school.
[00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:06.118]  It's not true.
[00:22:06.918 --> 00:22:10.658]  Except they're telling every student to go home with it and show up with it first thing in the morning.
[00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:17.900]  Yeah, and we walk home, a lot of us, a lot of my friends, they live right down the street from the school, they walk home, I walk home, and I walk pretty far home.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:24.501]  And the fact that somebody could pick up my signal while I'll be waiting for the car to pass scares me, and that is extremely frightening.
[00:22:25.185 --> 00:22:25.866]  It really should.
[00:22:26.226 --> 00:22:30.349]  But what kind of message are they sending to the students in the first place that you must accept this?
[00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:35.994]  Try to tell parents with that same hoax they use on the vaccine issue that this is not a negotiable issue.
[00:22:36.074 --> 00:22:40.738]  Somehow, just because it's a state government authority, we could just tell you what you're going to do.
[00:22:41.358 --> 00:22:44.461]  Now, what kind of kids are we training for the future?
[00:22:44.581 --> 00:22:45.922]  They're trying to condition the kids.
[00:22:46.463 --> 00:22:50.527]  That's how all of these governmental bodies start.
[00:22:50.567 --> 00:22:51.327]  They start with the kids.
[00:22:51.347 --> 00:22:52.088]  Let's start with the kids.
[00:22:52.128 --> 00:22:56.092]  We condition the children to think it's okay and it's normal to be trapped.
[00:22:56.973 --> 00:22:58.134]  I don't mean to be inflammatory.
[00:22:58.174 --> 00:22:58.874]  Hitler said that.
[00:22:58.914 --> 00:23:01.657]  He said, get the children, get the women, then you get the whole society.
[00:23:01.717 --> 00:23:01.977]  Exactly.
[00:23:02.177 --> 00:23:03.439]  And he knew what he was doing.
[00:23:04.239 --> 00:23:05.781]  That's why he did what he did.
[00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:06.081]  Yeah.
[00:23:07.774 --> 00:23:09.035]  You always start with the children.
[00:23:09.055 --> 00:23:09.235]  Why?
[00:23:09.275 --> 00:23:11.655]  Because they know that's the most sensitive part of a parent's heart.
[00:23:12.776 --> 00:23:15.217]  You grab that kid, and that parent's going to go along with it.
[00:23:15.497 --> 00:23:17.738]  You grab that spouse, that other one's going to go along with it.
[00:23:18.058 --> 00:23:18.538]  But guess what?
[00:23:18.598 --> 00:23:20.359]  In Hernandez's family, that's not going to happen.
[00:23:21.459 --> 00:23:26.741]  My family would much rather be persecuted, and if we have to die for our cause, but guess what?
[00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:27.581]  It's not our cause.
[00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:30.062]  We're dying for our Lord Jesus Christ, God Almighty.
[00:23:30.883 --> 00:23:34.564]  I would rather reap my rewards in Heaven than reap them here on Earth.
[00:23:35.475 --> 00:23:37.637]  And we're supposed to fight back against tyranny.
[00:23:37.937 --> 00:23:38.617]  It's in the Bible.
[00:23:38.638 --> 00:23:42.040]  You're not supposed to lay around waiting for the apocalypse to happen.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.343]  You're supposed to be doing what's right and standing up for what's right.
[00:23:45.643 --> 00:23:46.283]  Well, absolutely.
[00:23:46.644 --> 00:23:51.608]  You know, if you don't stand for something, then what are you really doing?
[00:23:51.968 --> 00:23:55.291]  You're just existing and going through life?
[00:23:56.952 --> 00:23:58.353]  You've got to stand for something.
[00:23:58.613 --> 00:24:00.515]  You've got to stand for something.
[00:24:00.595 --> 00:24:04.718]  And I keep telling everybody, I can't believe I'm here in this situation at this part in my life.
[00:24:05.925 --> 00:24:08.207]  I stood up two weeks ago and said no.
[00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:09.668]  My daughter said no.
[00:24:11.009 --> 00:24:17.654]  You know, in her school, they're actually bribing the children with candies and gifts to wear around their necks.
[00:24:18.534 --> 00:24:29.502]  I have a class period, my third period, the teacher, she was standing outside the door with a big ol' bucket of candy, and the kids that had already had their IDs on, she gave them candy, and I was like, where'd you get the candy?
[00:24:29.522 --> 00:24:30.563]  How come I didn't get one, though?
[00:24:31.264 --> 00:24:33.125]  Oh, she's giving them out if you have your ID, and I was like,
[00:24:34.266 --> 00:24:34.546]  White?
[00:24:34.566 --> 00:24:35.587]  They go, yeah!
[00:24:36.067 --> 00:24:38.148]  She said, if we wear them around our neck, we get the candy.
[00:24:38.168 --> 00:24:39.749]  And I was like, are you serious?
[00:24:40.289 --> 00:24:47.173]  And then, you know, they're like, oh, you're gonna get in trouble, you'll lose your position on your extracurricular activities, like football, and cheer, and pep, and stuff like that.
[00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:50.755]  Those coaches are saying that you must wear them, and they must be visible at all times.
[00:24:50.815 --> 00:24:56.418]  And, you know, it's making it hard even to go to the restroom now, because you have to have it on in the hallways, that way we know who you are.
[00:24:56.438 --> 00:24:59.499]  If you want to know who I am, get to know me, sit down with me, and talk with me.
[00:24:59.539 --> 00:25:00.980]  Don't put a badge on me.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.661]  Yeah, I mean, what happened to a name and a face and getting to know people?
[00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:18.187]  But the other thing, too, they're trying to control you through peer pressure at a time when you're growing up, you're trying to figure out who you are, you're trying to meet other people, make friends, and that's what's going to get noticed, the fact you're an individual, that you're strong enough to stand up for yourself.
[00:25:18.567 --> 00:25:24.649]  You're the kind of person people want to get to know and respect in the community, people who just go along with whatever they're told to do.
[00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.152]  That's pretty uninteresting, really.
[00:25:28.172 --> 00:25:40.844]  Yeah, and, you know, I get a lot of people who are supposed to be friends, or supposed to be people that are on my side at all times, and then yet, when this issue gets brought up, oh, I don't talk to you, or, you know, it's just weird, dude, it's not a big deal.
[00:25:41.505 --> 00:25:45.767]  But the thing is, it's a really big deal, and, you know, students need to understand that.
[00:25:45.827 --> 00:25:51.049]  They need to open their eyes, because Northside is just saying, oh, it's not dangerous, it's not, you know, it's not a big deal.
[00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:56.291]  And yet, they track you at school, and they tell you how to track you on the bus, but they do.
[00:25:56.431 --> 00:26:00.653]  I asked my bus driver, and I said, sir, what is this little thing above your window?
[00:26:00.693 --> 00:26:02.094]  He goes, oh, that's for the Home Projects.
[00:26:02.134 --> 00:26:03.114]  And I was like, what Home Projects?
[00:26:03.154 --> 00:26:04.675]  And he's like, oh, your badges?
[00:26:04.695 --> 00:26:05.035]  And I was like,
[00:26:05.655 --> 00:26:07.456]  The new ones, he goes, yep, that's what it's for.
[00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:12.579]  So now they're tracking my bus ride home and, you know, I'm... I'm sorry, you have to scan this when you get on the school bus?
[00:26:12.599 --> 00:26:14.840]  No, it picks up the signal just like it does at the school.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.181]  It picks up the signal and lets you know who's on the bus.
[00:26:17.762 --> 00:26:17.962]  Wow.
[00:26:18.262 --> 00:26:19.423]  I mean, really dangerous.
[00:26:19.583 --> 00:26:25.126]  All sold in the name of safety, but it's completely hijackable and exploitable by the wrong person in authority.
[00:26:25.706 --> 00:26:26.427]  Just like everything.
[00:26:26.527 --> 00:26:26.987]  Absolutely.
[00:26:27.027 --> 00:26:28.548]  You know, I'd like to know...
[00:26:29.545 --> 00:26:31.146]  How this makes anybody any safer?
[00:26:31.866 --> 00:26:33.187]  This is a centralized system.
[00:26:33.247 --> 00:26:37.510]  Our government was set up on a balance of powers, knowing that bad people are going to get into power.
[00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:42.052]  And it's better for them to fight amongst each other than to give all the power to one person.
[00:26:42.332 --> 00:26:43.933]  And this is exactly what they've done, sir.
[00:26:44.233 --> 00:26:50.737]  They have given all the power to the school district and a handful of police officers who can watch this at all times.
[00:26:51.878 --> 00:26:55.560]  They have people thinking, hey, in case of a fire, this would be great.
[00:26:57.591 --> 00:26:58.091]  I don't understand.
[00:26:58.131 --> 00:26:58.872]  How is it going to be great?
[00:26:59.352 --> 00:27:04.256]  Because growing up, and even to this day, everybody has fire drills at school anyways, right?
[00:27:04.677 --> 00:27:06.098]  So we all know how to get out of the school.
[00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:12.443]  What about the poor guy who's sitting in there trying to find the last person with a badge?
[00:27:13.344 --> 00:27:16.606]  Let's say, for instance, that kid decided, well, I'm going to put my badge over here in the bathroom.
[00:27:16.626 --> 00:27:17.747]  Because it's time to get out of here.
[00:27:17.767 --> 00:27:19.088]  I don't have time to grab that badge.
[00:27:19.608 --> 00:27:20.489]  Exactly.
[00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:25.233]  So they're doing this for money, and they're doing this for power.
[00:27:26.061 --> 00:27:31.084]  It costs $525,000 to implement this program in only two schools.
[00:27:32.345 --> 00:27:33.446]  In only two schools.
[00:27:33.466 --> 00:27:34.947]  It costs $136,000 a year to run that program.
[00:27:34.967 --> 00:27:38.409]  Now take those numbers and multiply it by the other 110 schools.
[00:27:38.469 --> 00:27:42.392]  And then take that number of $136,000 and multiply that by those schools.
[00:27:42.432 --> 00:27:42.912]  It's astronomical.
[00:27:54.346 --> 00:27:55.347]  Where are they coming up with the money?
[00:27:55.387 --> 00:27:59.910]  And what people don't understand, it's our tax dollars that are going to this program.
[00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.391]  But they want to fire teachers.
[00:28:01.431 --> 00:28:03.393]  But they want to get rid of teachers.
[00:28:04.574 --> 00:28:06.896]  They don't have chairs for psych classes.
[00:28:07.056 --> 00:28:07.956]  They don't have books.
[00:28:07.976 --> 00:28:14.381]  There's some teachers printing books for students off their printers because they don't have money for books.
[00:28:14.862 --> 00:28:16.563]  But yet they have $525,000 to implement a program that nobody wants?
[00:28:21.135 --> 00:28:21.956]  It's really creepy.
[00:28:21.996 --> 00:28:28.123]  So what do you think is the best way to get other parents to recognize the danger, other students to realize this isn't such a good idea?
[00:28:28.544 --> 00:28:29.925]  How do we start to say no to this?
[00:28:29.965 --> 00:28:33.369]  To have the courage to stand up and realize the school is not the ultimate authority.
[00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:35.332]  I mean, you've made a big stand already.
[00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:40.542]  But have you seen other people supporting you, or are they all just skeptical of what you're doing?
[00:28:40.922 --> 00:28:42.423]  There's a few that support me.
[00:28:43.023 --> 00:28:47.724]  I heard about one kid who actually zapped his badge, put it in the microwave, and boop, zapped it.
[00:28:47.804 --> 00:28:50.505]  So I was like, okay, at least somebody agrees with me.
[00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:52.946]  But I have a bunch of kids who are just like, you know, whatever.
[00:28:52.966 --> 00:28:55.067]  And I was like, no, it's not whatever.
[00:28:57.017 --> 00:28:58.258]  Invasion of your privacy.
[00:28:58.578 --> 00:29:00.118]  And a lot of people are like, well, I'm a Christian.
[00:29:00.178 --> 00:29:03.380]  And a kid actually told me the other day, he goes, well, why are you doing this?
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.321]  And I was like, because, you know, you're stepping on my religious beliefs.
[00:29:06.341 --> 00:29:07.901]  He goes, well, what religion are you?
[00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:09.162]  And I was like, well, you know, I'm a Christian.
[00:29:09.202 --> 00:29:11.103]  He goes, well, I'm sort of a Christian.
[00:29:11.143 --> 00:29:13.544]  And the first thing that pops in my head, I was like, how can you be sort of a Christian?
[00:29:13.564 --> 00:29:14.464]  You either are or you aren't.
[00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:15.945]  It's simple as that.
[00:29:15.965 --> 00:29:20.527]  And I was like, well, look, you know, this is, you know, the implementing of the mark of the beast.
[00:29:20.587 --> 00:29:20.887]  And he goes,
[00:29:21.647 --> 00:29:22.848]  It's just a badge, just wear it.
[00:29:23.189 --> 00:29:28.053]  And I looked at him and I was like, okay, if you want to wear your badge, that's fine, but as for me, I will not wear my badge.
[00:29:28.074 --> 00:29:29.455]  And I turned around and left him alone.
[00:29:29.975 --> 00:29:32.938]  Well, you understand the larger picture of what's going on.
[00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:39.965]  I mean, you're in the engineering department, you're studying for that kind of studies, you obviously know what's in the Bible, know what your religion is.
[00:29:40.926 --> 00:29:43.448]  These people, guaranteed, can't read their literature books.
[00:29:43.488 --> 00:29:44.148]  They're a sign.
[00:29:44.508 --> 00:29:45.489]  Aren't reading the Bible.
[00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:47.210]  Have no idea what's in these verses.
[00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:53.994]  And it's very sad, but we've got to help wake people up and nudge them back to the fact that information is how you empower yourself.
[00:29:54.014 --> 00:29:54.334]  Yeah.
[00:29:54.615 --> 00:29:55.615]  Information is knowledge.
[00:29:56.076 --> 00:29:56.356]  Okay?
[00:29:56.856 --> 00:29:58.137]  A lot of these people are scared.
[00:29:58.417 --> 00:29:59.838]  They don't want to stand up for themselves.
[00:30:00.318 --> 00:30:06.282]  They're afraid, oh, if I don't do this or tell my child not to do this, we're going to be in so much trouble.
[00:30:06.942 --> 00:30:08.163]  But all they've got to do is look at us.
[00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:08.863]  We're not in trouble.
[00:30:09.584 --> 00:30:09.724]  Okay?
[00:30:10.325 --> 00:30:14.048]  So for those who are misinformed, we have to find a way to inform them.
[00:30:14.188 --> 00:30:14.968]  And how do we do that?
[00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:21.333]  By these position papers that we presented to the Board of Trustees.
[00:30:21.974 --> 00:30:25.416]  This position paper states why these things should not be used.
[00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:27.878]  And if you're going to use them, what you need to do.
[00:30:27.898 --> 00:30:29.019]  Okay?
[00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:34.543]  We've been handing out flyers, position papers, we've been talking to people, we've got websites coming up.
[00:30:34.923 --> 00:30:35.603]  The kids have
[00:30:38.459 --> 00:30:40.942]  Facebook today put up Gabby and my daughter Andrea.
[00:30:41.262 --> 00:30:47.810]  Gabby is another student from Marshall High School who stood up with her mom who used to teach in NISD for seven years.
[00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:54.097]  And she stood up and she says, I used to be a teacher, a substitute teacher as well, and I disagree with this.
[00:30:54.637 --> 00:30:57.060]  And her daughter stood up and said, hey, my name is Gabby.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:57.641]  I'm not number
[00:30:58.493 --> 00:30:59.694]  Whatever, whatever her number is.
[00:30:59.914 --> 00:31:00.134]  Okay?
[00:31:00.154 --> 00:31:00.514]  Exactly.
[00:31:00.835 --> 00:31:03.477]  So, how do we get people informed?
[00:31:03.537 --> 00:31:04.657]  By doing what we're doing today.
[00:31:05.198 --> 00:31:06.379]  We come on shows like this.
[00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:07.419]  We go on the internet.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.481]  We go on radio talk shows.
[00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:10.882]  We hand out information.
[00:31:11.883 --> 00:31:13.023]  We just talk to people.
[00:31:13.244 --> 00:31:16.526]  You know, we're getting to the point where we're getting ready to start knocking on doors in our community.
[00:31:17.006 --> 00:31:26.253]  But, you know, we're inviting everybody to go to NISD's website, contact Brian T. Woods and the Board of Trustees, and tell them what your objection is.
[00:31:26.733 --> 00:31:27.454]  We object to this.
[00:31:28.206 --> 00:31:28.766]  We don't want it.
[00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:36.610]  If you go to WOAI Channel 4, their poll shows that 71% of people believe this is invasion of privacy.
[00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:42.312]  But those 71% of the people need to get up and say, hey, Mr. Brian T. Woods, we don't want this.
[00:31:42.913 --> 00:31:43.393]  We're done with it.
[00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:49.008]  I am not afraid to stand up for my civil liberties, my religious freedom, and the protection of my children.
[00:31:49.228 --> 00:31:52.932]  And we better not be, because they're going to keep going, and keep going, and keep going.
[00:31:53.633 --> 00:32:01.361]  Now specifically, we ought to contact the people locally at your schools in San Antonio, because that's where they're trying to roll it out and get a stronghold.
[00:32:01.401 --> 00:32:04.524]  But people all across the nation, this is a national and global show,
[00:32:04.944 --> 00:32:08.625]  They need to preemptively contact their school districts and tell them not to even consider this.
[00:32:08.985 --> 00:32:15.806]  Because it's dangerous, it's costly, as you pointed out, and it's really a destructive force against our privacy and our individual rights.
[00:32:15.886 --> 00:32:16.766]  That's the bottom line.
[00:32:16.886 --> 00:32:17.766]  That's the bottom line.
[00:32:17.866 --> 00:32:20.467]  It's an invasion of privacy.
[00:32:21.067 --> 00:32:24.547]  But my first and foremost fight is religious belief.
[00:32:25.048 --> 00:32:27.368]  It's my religious freedom, my kids' religious freedom.
[00:32:27.668 --> 00:32:32.909]  I'm not going to condemn my children to the pit because NISD wants them to wear a chip.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:42.305]  My daughter stood up and she told them at the board, she told the board, and she says, I'm not going to compromise my freedom for NISD.
[00:32:42.805 --> 00:32:43.946]  And it's online right now.
[00:32:43.986 --> 00:32:44.606]  You can watch it.
[00:32:44.646 --> 00:32:46.167]  It should be on spychips.com.
[00:32:46.828 --> 00:32:47.388]  And it's there.
[00:32:48.208 --> 00:32:49.889]  Let me tell you what, we're going to fight this.
[00:32:49.989 --> 00:32:51.350]  This is not just the end.
[00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.431]  This is the beginning.
[00:32:52.451 --> 00:32:54.732]  We're going to put an end to this, no matter what.
[00:32:55.213 --> 00:33:00.616]  But our goal as a family and as a community and everybody who does support us, everybody who does support us,
[00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.690]  We're putting out information.
[00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:07.892]  You see a bunch of papers here in front of you because we're bringing information to you, and it's the same information we're giving out to the people.
[00:33:07.912 --> 00:33:10.293]  I mean, we have great support.
[00:33:10.353 --> 00:33:13.014]  We have almost 15 different organizations around the world.
[00:33:13.694 --> 00:33:20.036]  And, you know, from Caspian to, we are Change San Antonio, we are Change Texas Hill Country.
[00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:23.978]  I mean, we have Matthew Medina, we have Katherine Albrecht, Liz McIntyre.
[00:33:24.218 --> 00:33:25.798]  All these people, Katie Deloes.
[00:33:26.218 --> 00:33:31.020]  Katie came to my house and spent the weekend with us to help us put this protest together.
[00:33:31.894 --> 00:33:35.957]  She took time out of her schedule and her children and her family to come to be with us.
[00:33:36.838 --> 00:33:43.502]  I mean, I am grateful, and I have to tell everybody, you know, and I just, this is my opportunity to give thanks to a good friend of mine named Bobby Scott.
[00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:46.004]  If it wasn't for Bobby Scott, I wouldn't be here today.
[00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:54.410]  Because I was at work, my phone was ringing, I couldn't get to it, and I'm not supposed to have my phone at work, and at break time I went to check, he had called me six times.
[00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:57.793]  So I decided to call him, and I said, what's going on?
[00:33:57.833 --> 00:33:58.333]  He said, hey dude,
[00:33:59.068 --> 00:34:02.673]  I called you a couple hours ago because you need a guy on the radio right now that's talking about you.
[00:34:03.234 --> 00:34:04.595]  And I'm asking, what are they talking about?
[00:34:04.615 --> 00:34:06.297]  Because they're talking about you and these chips.
[00:34:07.058 --> 00:34:09.101]  You need to contact this lady named Katie Somebody.
[00:34:10.042 --> 00:34:14.348]  And so, I went on that particular radio station's website.
[00:34:15.117 --> 00:34:17.098]  Contact Katie Delores the very next day.
[00:34:17.118 --> 00:34:24.142]  I got a phone call and here I am two weeks later right here in Austin, Texas with you folks and we have to tell you thank you.
[00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:24.902]  You guys are wonderful.
[00:34:25.322 --> 00:34:32.146]  We appreciate y'all standing up and coming out and speaking out because everyone's against the issue who knows about these larger political issues.
[00:34:32.566 --> 00:34:33.427]  How could you not be?
[00:34:33.847 --> 00:34:41.553]  But to have a focal point of someone inside the school system standing up, it's so powerful because that's where the pressure really falls on them.
[00:34:41.873 --> 00:34:46.076]  And these companies who put out the RFID, they can be financially hurt, they can be bankrupted.
[00:34:46.136 --> 00:34:46.596]  It's happened.
[00:34:47.397 --> 00:34:55.123]  There'll be private funders and people giving them endless grants later, but still, we can back them off and eventually defeat the system and this is a great way to start.
[00:34:55.163 --> 00:34:56.684]  Did you want to give out that Facebook?
[00:34:57.104 --> 00:34:57.885]  Because you mentioned that.
[00:34:57.905 --> 00:34:58.145]  Yeah.
[00:34:58.165 --> 00:34:59.346]  Where you're trying to rally people.
[00:34:59.386 --> 00:34:59.806]  Go ahead, honey.
[00:35:00.867 --> 00:35:16.526]  Our Facebook page that me and Gabby created is called Students Against RFID Tracking and that is our Facebook page and you can go and like and we have videos and pictures and links to spy chips and all these other organizations and stuff that people need to see so they can be more informed.
[00:35:18.158 --> 00:35:19.519]  Great, we hope people check that out.
[00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:22.401]  And are y'all doing on-the-street protests or anything like that?
[00:35:22.782 --> 00:35:25.544]  Yeah, we had done one in front of Anson Jones on the first day of school.
[00:35:25.764 --> 00:35:28.006]  We did it again, did it twice.
[00:35:28.486 --> 00:35:36.232]  Then we did one about a week ago at NISD, the Northside Independent School District, district office, the superintendent's office.
[00:35:36.733 --> 00:35:40.756]  Then we went inside and it was citizens to be heard and there was about
[00:35:41.696 --> 00:35:44.577]  Six or seven of us have stood up and voiced our concerns.
[00:35:44.657 --> 00:35:47.098]  We had teachers, we had people from different organizations.
[00:35:47.838 --> 00:35:50.459]  And I stood up, my daughter stood up, and Gabby.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.801]  So a lot of things came out of that, but we're planning to hold another one.
[00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:56.101]  I believe it's going to be on the 25th.
[00:35:56.621 --> 00:36:00.783]  I think it's every second Tuesday of the month they have a Citizens to be Heard.
[00:36:01.463 --> 00:36:05.224]  So we're hoping to get hundreds of people to show up out there in support of this.
[00:36:05.944 --> 00:36:10.346]  And a lot of things have come out of this, and I've had a couple of people approach me to
[00:36:10.851 --> 00:36:12.732]  See if I wanted to run for office after this.
[00:36:13.293 --> 00:36:16.074]  So, you know, I was asked if I wanted to run for mayor or city council.
[00:36:16.615 --> 00:36:18.696]  And that's something that I would love to do.
[00:36:19.156 --> 00:36:23.119]  But right now, in order to get that part, I need to kick this in advance.
[00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:26.281]  And I guarantee, and I promise you right here, we're going to win this battle.
[00:36:26.661 --> 00:36:31.324]  Because of folks like you who are standing behind us saying, hey, let us help you put your word out.
[00:36:31.765 --> 00:36:32.545]  That's what we're here for.
[00:36:33.025 --> 00:36:35.787]  You know, and folks like you are helping us.
[00:36:35.807 --> 00:36:36.888]  I think it's going to really
[00:36:37.847 --> 00:36:40.369]  Yes, make this thing just so much more explosive.
[00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:42.010]  Well, I mean, we're human beings.
[00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:43.812]  We don't need no stinking badges.
[00:36:43.852 --> 00:36:47.214]  That's right, we don't need no stinking badges.
[00:36:47.675 --> 00:36:49.997]  I just want to read this quote real quick and then we'll close out.
[00:36:50.017 --> 00:36:51.058]  I'll get your response to it.
[00:36:51.338 --> 00:36:53.680]  This is from Carol Quigley, 1966.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.141]  Do you have the quote in there, guys?
[00:36:57.363 --> 00:37:01.528]  I just want to read this, because this system has been coming for a long time.
[00:37:01.988 --> 00:37:03.590]  And Carol Quigley writes on page 866,
[00:37:13.601 --> 00:37:23.626]  His educational training, his required military and other public service, his tax contributions, his health and medical requirements, his final retirement and death benefits.
[00:37:23.966 --> 00:37:38.774]  This is a government system, this is a control grid interlinked with the big corporations who see us as inventory, they don't see us as human beings and they have plans to literally control us from cradle to grave and RFID tracking technology plays a huge role in that.
[00:37:38.854 --> 00:37:43.056]  It's so scary, all the more because they've been planning it for so long.
[00:37:43.696 --> 00:37:45.419]  What's your reaction to that Steve and Andrew?
[00:37:47.222 --> 00:37:50.788]  Well, you know, the fact that they said in the quote that
[00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:58.093]  All throughout the education, they're only starting in middle school and high school because they haven't been able to, you know, do anything else through the elementary kids.
[00:37:58.213 --> 00:38:00.174]  I mean, they're little kids, you know, what are they going to do?
[00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:01.135]  Are they going to go skip school?
[00:38:01.175 --> 00:38:01.655]  No, you know.
[00:38:01.875 --> 00:38:03.476]  They're little, they're going to go do their education.
[00:38:03.496 --> 00:38:03.856]  Right.
[00:38:04.036 --> 00:38:08.079]  You know, and in high school and middle school, I understand there's a little bit more of a rebellion kind of thing.
[00:38:08.459 --> 00:38:13.442]  But for the most part, majority, they do go to school, they do learn, and they do take their tests and their quizzes and all that stuff.
[00:38:15.223 --> 00:38:18.612]  In fact, they do want to put it in the elementary, where it's unnecessary.
[00:38:18.633 --> 00:38:22.563]  It's unnecessary in all the schools, but they want to put it in, and it's...
[00:38:23.476 --> 00:38:34.439]  You know, ridiculous to a point where I wish I could talk to you for hours and hours and hours and tell people that, you know, there's so much more to this than just a badge.
[00:38:34.519 --> 00:38:36.219]  It's not just a chip or anything.
[00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:38.320]  It's a lot bigger, you know.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.241]  People can find you with this stuff, and you don't even need to know anything about the person.
[00:38:42.621 --> 00:38:47.142]  If there's a sexual predator out there, they can find you just because it missed a signal, you know?
[00:38:47.542 --> 00:38:50.663]  Because they have no boundaries, they have no respect, and they have nothing.
[00:38:51.443 --> 00:39:01.693]  So they don't mind going spending $200 off of eBay, eBay of all the places, to go get an RFID scanner that can pick you up, you know, when you walk home from school like me and a bunch of friends do.
[00:39:03.066 --> 00:39:03.866]  There you go, I got her.
[00:39:04.266 --> 00:39:07.107]  You know, she'll walk home alone tomorrow, and I can follow her home.
[00:39:07.307 --> 00:39:09.788]  And so creepy, and who's going to protect against that?
[00:39:10.068 --> 00:39:19.611]  Yeah, and it's all alone, you know, I'm at the point in time where I'm coming home, and everybody's at work, or they're barely coming home, and all the kids are already home, because I get home later than everybody else.
[00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:26.533]  And, you know, I walk all by myself, all on this real big street, nobody out there to protect me but myself.
[00:39:28.153 --> 00:39:29.814]  And that quote in that book is absolutely correct.
[00:39:30.533 --> 00:39:32.133]  At birth, what do we get?
[00:39:32.153 --> 00:39:33.033]  A social security number.
[00:39:34.494 --> 00:39:37.854]  When you go into school, you get an ID badge.
[00:39:38.575 --> 00:39:42.175]  And on this ID badge is your student ID.
[00:39:44.196 --> 00:39:47.556]  You get in a checking account, you have a number assigned to you.
[00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:51.297]  When we're born, we have a name assigned to us.
[00:39:51.857 --> 00:39:55.158]  Now it's looking like we don't need names no more, we just need numbers.
[00:39:56.578 --> 00:39:57.238]  When you die,
[00:40:00.475 --> 00:40:04.898]  Your name goes with you to the grave, but your number is still out there.
[00:40:05.198 --> 00:40:06.479]  Because they know that you're dead.
[00:40:06.499 --> 00:40:09.021]  They say, okay, number so-and-so is now gone.
[00:40:09.621 --> 00:40:10.962]  Yeah, it's absolutely correct.
[00:40:11.383 --> 00:40:14.545]  They track you from the cradle to the grave and in between.
[00:40:14.565 --> 00:40:16.146]  And that's the way it is.
[00:40:16.406 --> 00:40:17.447]  We are no longer people.
[00:40:17.487 --> 00:40:18.327]  We are products.
[00:40:19.488 --> 00:40:19.868]  But guess what?
[00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:24.111]  Stephen Hernandez, Andre Hernandez, Vincent Hernandez, we are not products.
[00:40:26.113 --> 00:40:27.073]  I tell you what, we are products.
[00:40:27.194 --> 00:40:29.235]  We are products of the Lord Jesus Christ, God Almighty.
[00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:30.972]  We are His children.
[00:40:32.132 --> 00:40:33.893]  And if we stand for God, He'll stand for us.
[00:40:34.774 --> 00:40:38.496]  Or if God stands for you, then who can stand against you?
[00:40:39.317 --> 00:40:43.360]  Greater is He that is in you, than He that is in the world.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.321]  Many people don't understand what that means.
[00:40:46.021 --> 00:40:47.382]  What that means is God is great.
[00:40:47.462 --> 00:40:53.466]  If He's inside you, if He's your Lord God, your Savior, and He can protect you no matter where you go.
[00:40:54.347 --> 00:40:59.570]  He that is in the world refers to the devil, or people who are worldly, who want the worldly possessions right here, right now.
[00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.810]  Guess what?
[00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:04.093]  Your gift is greater in heaven than it is on earth.
[00:41:04.834 --> 00:41:08.917]  You see, Hollywood and actors and sports guys, I mean, they all live in a great life.
[00:41:10.058 --> 00:41:12.780]  But not one has opened the Bible to read it.
[00:41:14.382 --> 00:41:15.162]  Not if they have.
[00:41:15.623 --> 00:41:16.383]  They don't live by it.
[00:41:17.164 --> 00:41:18.565]  I'm not saying we're a perfect family.
[00:41:18.585 --> 00:41:19.546]  We all have our faults.
[00:41:20.227 --> 00:41:24.050]  But I tell you what, my fault is standing up for what is right.
[00:41:25.051 --> 00:41:26.692]  This, sort of okay with.
[00:41:26.972 --> 00:41:27.573]  This, I'm not.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.882]  And my family, my children, were not worth this.
[00:41:31.202 --> 00:41:36.506]  And I ask everybody out there, everybody out there watching this show today, please support us.
[00:41:36.567 --> 00:41:37.607]  Go to those websites.
[00:41:38.008 --> 00:41:39.209]  Call that school district.
[00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:41.591]  Send out emails.
[00:41:42.251 --> 00:41:44.713]  Whatever you got to do to help us, we would appreciate it.
[00:41:45.254 --> 00:41:46.214]  We're asking for help.
[00:41:46.615 --> 00:41:48.216]  That's why we're here today to tell our story.
[00:41:48.536 --> 00:41:49.477]  We want that help.
[00:41:49.517 --> 00:41:51.379]  We want people to come out and support us.
[00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:57.404]  And drones, we want hundreds of people to come out there because it would make our plight greater and make our
[00:41:58.686 --> 00:42:00.067]  Our stance known more.
[00:42:01.027 --> 00:42:07.070]  I'm here today to ask for everybody's help and I want to give thanks to, once again, to my friend Bobby Scott out there.
[00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:08.311]  I can't think of enough.
[00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:16.895]  Catherine Albrecht, Liz McIntyre, Katie, Matt Medina, Chris, Steve, every person.
[00:42:17.575 --> 00:42:25.999]  Alex Jones, I tell you what, you, every guy that's sitting in the studio today, you guys are all been wonderful and God bless you all and we're just asking for help.
[00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:27.380]  So if there's anybody out there,
[00:42:28.035 --> 00:42:29.276]  Feel free to go to those websites.
[00:42:29.396 --> 00:42:31.677]  Feel free to come visit at NISD.
[00:42:32.358 --> 00:42:34.019]  And let's make our voices heard.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920]  Thanks so much for coming out.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.361]  Bless you too.
[00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:36.841]  Thank you sir.
[00:42:36.861 --> 00:42:37.541]  Appreciate it.
[00:42:37.841 --> 00:42:38.202]  Thank you.
[00:42:38.522 --> 00:42:39.663]  Glad you're standing up, Andrea.
[00:42:40.243 --> 00:42:40.924]  Thanks a lot, Vincent.
[00:42:43.785 --> 00:42:47.368]  And we'll be back after this with more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
