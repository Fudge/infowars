[00:00:06.363 --> 00:00:10.547]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:12.009]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:13.710]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:17.974]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:22.599]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:42.258]  Oh yes, my friends, it is Monday, the 18th day of March 2013, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours, Lord willing.
[00:00:48.073 --> 00:01:13.307]  Popping in the second half of the second hour is a pro-Second Amendment advocate, a lady, Juliana Crowder, who's gotten a lot of national attention, breaking the stereotype that it's only men that enjoy shooting and use firearms to protect themselves, and really the condescension that women can't become proficient with firearms, when I found women on average, once you get them around firearms, are better shots than men.
[00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:21.801]  Because they can calm down a little bit more when they pull the trigger, and that's an oversimplification, but that's been shown in some of the Olympic shooting.
[00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:24.843]  Side issue, she'll be popping in.
[00:01:24.903 --> 00:01:30.665]  Gerald Salente has accurately predicted that it would start with bank holidays in Europe and spread to the United States.
[00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.666]  He's been saying that for about five years.
[00:01:33.087 --> 00:01:36.268]  He's gonna come on, and let's punch up DrudgeReport.com for TV viewers.
[00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.470]  Radio listeners, just go there, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.211]  Cyprus shuts banks until Thursday.
[00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:53.229]  Now, we put an article up about this yesterday on Infowars.com and we had people on there saying it wasn't true, even though I was linked to the BBC and Forbes.
[00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.170]  I mean, that just shows this culture of denial.
[00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.732]  How long did I tell you that the Justice Department would go after News Corp and that that's why News Corp was suddenly worshipping the New World Order and loving socialism?
[00:02:06.152 --> 00:02:08.153]  Holder investigates Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:19.948]  And again, I'm not saying News Corp is perfect, not by a long shot, but you can't have the devil investigating a scoundrel.
[00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.069]  A scoundrel is not the devil.
[00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:33.436]  The Justice Department is a devilish crew right now, no doubt about it, who stage Fast and Furious, who were obviously involved intimately in Oklahoma City back in 95.
[00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:36.818]  The very same crew who were deputies are now in charge there.
[00:02:36.838 --> 00:02:38.359]  It's really scary.
[00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:46.152]  And if they can bring down Rush Limbaugh and News Corp, then everybody else is on target.
[00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:50.741]  That's what the White House memos via Media Matters said two years ago.
[00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:53.164]  They said, they're going to bring down the alternative media.
[00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:54.625]  And what do they see that as?
[00:02:55.146 --> 00:03:03.915]  If you even pay lip service to the Bill of Rights and Constitution, or criticize Al Gore and anthropogenic global warming fake theories, you are the enemy.
[00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:08.560]  Because they can sweep them aside, they can sweep everybody aside.
[00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:14.740]  And they're running this hoax right now that it's a mandate for Obama and total socialism.
[00:03:15.441 --> 00:03:16.461]  Here's some of the other headlines.
[00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:18.382]  New EU bailout plan.
[00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:19.623]  Steal bank accounts.
[00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:23.465]  Ireland set to seize personal savings.
[00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:24.306]  They're already doing it.
[00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:25.546]  That's why it's closed till Thursday.
[00:03:25.587 --> 00:03:26.307]  They always do that.
[00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:28.508]  The agreement is to do it.
[00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:36.233]  And the Parliament of Cyprus would not
[00:03:38.422 --> 00:03:42.464]  Vote quickly enough today, so they've just said they're going ahead with the plan basically.
[00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:44.785]  Plan moves ahead as vote delayed.
[00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:46.426]  See, it is linked right there.
[00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:48.287]  Putin, unfair, dangerous.
[00:03:48.787 --> 00:03:50.628]  Financial Times, here comes the bank runs.
[00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:53.510]  Germany, not our idea, even though it was their idea.
[00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.350]  Will Italy follow?
[00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:06.336]  That's an Infowars.com article with top German bankers calling for a 15% seizure of money, of after-tax money, out of your bank account.
[00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.989]  Continuing, markets rattled.
[00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.470]  Euro tumbles.
[00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.450]  Dow drops.
[00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.450]  Live feeds of that.
[00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:24.392]  And then of course, it's already causing bank lines to form in other European countries.
[00:04:24.432 --> 00:04:25.212]  You can look that up.
[00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:32.634]  There were lines in places like Greece and Spain yesterday to get money out of ATMs.
[00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.441]  And this is done by design to rattle the markets.
[00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:38.002]  I'll explain all this when we come back.
[00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:39.143]  This is a big deal.
[00:04:39.163 --> 00:04:50.693]  And we're going to open the phones up specifically for stockbrokers, investors who want to call in and talk about this issue of the global financial meltdown.
[00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:57.138]  I'm not going to talk about how many Easter bunnies can dance on the head of a pin or anything like that.
[00:04:57.158 --> 00:04:59.961]  We're going to talk about this big mega issue today.
[00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:10.365]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:14.107]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:05:14.327 --> 00:05:18.488]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[00:05:18.788 --> 00:05:23.550]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[00:06:01.932 --> 00:06:08.916]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:06:09.156 --> 00:06:26.786]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:06:27.046 --> 00:06:31.168]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:06:31.428 --> 00:06:33.009]  And discovered Young Jevity.
[00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:41.055]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.611]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:17.732]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:07:17.852 --> 00:07:28.635]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:07:28.855 --> 00:07:35.140]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.

[00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:52.994]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:23.892]  Yes, we can see for miles... and miles... and miles...
[00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:49.140]  Yes, we know about the little tricks they play.
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.561]  And they do the same tricks over and over again, the country after country.
[00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:57.122]  Sometimes two or three times the same country in one decade, like what they do in Mexico.
[00:08:57.142 --> 00:09:13.307]  I remember being a little kid and my dad explaining currency devaluations and why we could go to Mexico with a couple hundred dollars and stay a week in a very nice hotels and eat and rent a fishing boat.
[00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:23.477]  And it was because their government had devalued their money because short term it allowed the elites to rob their population.
[00:09:24.337 --> 00:09:39.691]  And he explained to me the Weimar Republic, the devaluation of the German Deutsche Mark, ahead of the collapse of the Weimar Republic into Nazi fascism,
[00:09:41.207 --> 00:09:53.910]  And my dad explained to me how they'd done this in countless third world countries and how the insiders were able to maneuver economies and implode them to consolidate them.
[00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.731]  So I just grew up getting history lessons everywhere I went.
[00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:00.771]  And I thought that was normal.
[00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:04.692]  I thought it was normal for your parents to teach you about basic economics.
[00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:09.073]  Nowadays, I talk to adults who have business degrees
[00:10:10.513 --> 00:10:14.878]  And who are worth, in some cases, billions of dollars.
[00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:19.944]  Billions of dollars.
[00:10:23.888 --> 00:10:28.553]  And they are not even really aware of what's going on.
[00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:31.497]  Or now if they are,
[00:10:34.417 --> 00:10:46.582]  They just have had it so easy in America, and things have been so stagnant in a good way for so long, and they've been so insulated, they're not even aware of what's going on.
[00:10:49.264 --> 00:10:52.105]  Now those are self-made people worth $500 million, $1 billion, $2 billion.
[00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.406]  Those are self-made people worth billions of dollars.
[00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:06.141]  When you look at the insider True Elite class, they are fully aware of the scam.
[00:11:07.262 --> 00:11:10.385]  And I'll tell you why, because they have orchestrated it.
[00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:24.700]  So when I say that I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles, it's no sleight of hand, it's no special trick.
[00:11:26.784 --> 00:11:32.948]  It's like being able to get up in the morning and see sun coming through the blinds and open the window and see the sun rising.
[00:11:34.288 --> 00:11:41.873]  But you've got to be able to open your eyes and you've got to be able to stand up and you've got to be able to know what a sun is.
[00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:47.462]  And that's an oversimplification, but that's the point we've reached.
[00:11:47.842 --> 00:11:57.345]  The head of the Dallas Federal Reserve, also the head of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, both amongst some of the most powerful after the New York Fed that really runs everything.
[00:11:57.685 --> 00:11:58.705]  That's where Geithner came from.
[00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:04.107]  But they represent some of the smaller shareholders groups involved in the private 1913 deal.
[00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:10.450]  Those private shares that are ultimately valuable in this fraudulent economic system.
[00:12:11.071 --> 00:12:15.593]  You've got the Dallas Fed saying, we have crony capitalism, the entire economy.
[00:12:15.653 --> 00:12:16.373]  I have his quotes here.
[00:12:16.393 --> 00:12:17.634]  I'm going to pull these out in a moment.
[00:12:17.934 --> 00:12:18.635]  It's in Reuters.
[00:12:19.735 --> 00:12:26.299]  That we're in a critical moment and that crony capitalists are imploding the economy to consolidate it at the expense of us all.
[00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:33.523]  Now, why would the head of the Dallas Fed, a big insider, as well as the Kansas City Fed, and they've been critical the last few years.
[00:12:33.603 --> 00:12:35.204]  Now they're downright panicking.
[00:12:36.144 --> 00:12:37.607]  Why would they be publicly panicking?
[00:12:38.669 --> 00:12:40.331]  Because they're not pure evil.
[00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.417]  They want to have a future for their grandchildren.
[00:12:44.699 --> 00:12:48.082]  They don't want to fully destroy America and kill the Golden Goose.
[00:12:48.122 --> 00:13:07.479]  I mean, even if you're not a moral person, even if you're not really a good guy and don't care about other people, there's a reason to have a civilization because then there'll be nothing to even prey on for most of the parasite class if the ultra-parasite class wrecks everything in a scorched-earth takeover.
[00:13:11.365 --> 00:13:14.107]  So I'm going to get to that article here today.
[00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.729]  I'm going to go over some of these headlines here.
[00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:20.372]  But let me direct you to InfoWars.com if you're a radio listener.
[00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:24.055]  If you're a TV listener, you can see it punched up right now live.
[00:13:24.356 --> 00:13:28.839]  Proposed Cypriot, that's Cyprus, bank deposit theft.
[00:13:28.979 --> 00:13:30.921]  Good news for gold.
[00:13:31.401 --> 00:13:32.442]  Yeah, gold's way up.
[00:13:34.044 --> 00:13:39.208]  Banking chief calls for 15% looting of Italians' savings.
[00:13:41.277 --> 00:13:44.759]  That's a Paul Watson article linking to the open announcements in the German press.
[00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:48.180]  The rape of Cyprus by the European Union and the IMF.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.981]  Zero hedge.
[00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:52.342]  Cyprus government's great bank robbery.
[00:13:52.702 --> 00:13:56.004]  A private accounts may shut off bank runs across Europe.
[00:13:56.344 --> 00:13:58.285]  Yeah, it's already happening.
[00:13:58.425 --> 00:13:59.646]  I've gone and looked at some intel.
[00:14:00.286 --> 00:14:03.267]  They are talking about long lines and things, not just there but in other countries.
[00:14:03.327 --> 00:14:04.508]  And now they've closed it.
[00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:06.749]  First it was going to be just Monday, then to Wednesday, now Thursday.
[00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:08.530]  It'll probably end up being closed for a week.
[00:14:09.628 --> 00:14:13.911]  And once it opens, they'll take 10 to now 12 percent.
[00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:15.372]  They're now saying 12.
[00:14:16.433 --> 00:14:22.057]  After banksters steal money from accounts in Cyprus, they will start doing it everywhere, Michael Snyder reports.
[00:14:22.378 --> 00:14:23.178]  Absolutely, Michael.
[00:14:23.979 --> 00:14:28.282]  Russia sending warship fleet to Mediterranean.
[00:14:28.862 --> 00:14:31.064]  Russian naval base in Cyprus coming next.
[00:14:31.624 --> 00:14:34.847]  And yes, there's reports in MSNBC and other places.
[00:14:35.487 --> 00:14:37.769]  I forgot to print that or text it to you guys.
[00:14:37.809 --> 00:14:38.530]  Will you print me?
[00:14:41.092 --> 00:14:47.116]  Uh, Russia offers Cyprus aid and what they're saying is they'll come in and bail them out and then prop them up.
[00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:51.698]  So it's kind of like one gangster is coming in and saying, look, we won't take your bank accounts.
[00:14:51.738 --> 00:14:53.780]  Just let us have a naval base.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.162]  And then, and then we'll give you some deals on gas with gas prom as well.
[00:14:58.222 --> 00:15:04.346]  The big Russian owned Russian government controlled gas giant that holds Italy by the short hairs as well.
[00:15:05.746 --> 00:15:07.448]  So, all of this is going on.
[00:15:07.488 --> 00:15:09.170]  I mean, these are the times wars start.
[00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.772]  You got fleets cruising around.
[00:15:10.812 --> 00:15:14.756]  You got, out in the open, pure gangsterism.
[00:15:16.538 --> 00:15:18.840]  And it is no special feat.
[00:15:19.661 --> 00:15:20.502]  It is no trick.
[00:15:21.143 --> 00:15:27.690]  People are like, Alex, how did you know they would start just seizing money directly out of bank accounts across the board?
[00:15:31.021 --> 00:15:34.963]  And there it is, Sky News, Cyprus bailout, saving shift amid Russian offer.
[00:15:35.303 --> 00:15:36.204]  Will you print that for me?
[00:15:36.244 --> 00:15:36.524]  Thank you.
[00:15:36.964 --> 00:15:39.266]  So I can go into it in detail.
[00:15:41.487 --> 00:15:42.608]  I was out late last night.
[00:15:42.628 --> 00:15:45.369]  I rarely do that, so I didn't get much sleep last night.
[00:15:45.589 --> 00:15:47.450]  Very interesting business meeting last night.
[00:15:47.911 --> 00:15:50.692]  Not really business, but a lot of business was discussed.
[00:15:50.712 --> 00:15:56.496]  I learned quite a bit about certain sectors of the world last night.
[00:16:00.154 --> 00:16:19.146]  You know, I'm just absolutely committed to staying calm during all of this, but the IMF and the World Bank are the global virtual reality outfits or uniforms that the private six global megabanks wear.
[00:16:20.067 --> 00:16:29.173]  They are the holding companies, and then sub-directives of that of the Federal Reserve here in the United States, the Bank of England in England, obviously.
[00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:33.016]  But they've done this over and over and over again.
[00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:37.545]  Joseph Stiklitz, who left the World Bank as their chief economist in 2002.
[00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.811]  Thousands of pages of documents were leaked to...
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.021]  Greg Pallast.
[00:16:44.101 --> 00:16:45.041]  It was at the BBC.
[00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:47.023]  By the way, can you guys get Greg Pallast the next few days?
[00:16:47.043 --> 00:16:48.083]  I meant to tell you.
[00:16:48.123 --> 00:16:49.124]  Let's get Greg Pallast on.
[00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:51.706]  And Greg released a bunch of the documents.
[00:16:51.806 --> 00:16:56.569]  Then the British government started declaring national security and threatening denotices.
[00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:02.373]  That's where they can shut down any press report that they don't want out.
[00:17:03.734 --> 00:17:10.018]  And they didn't release but a few hundred pages of them.
[00:17:10.762 --> 00:17:32.159]  And in those, it talked about the 112 point plan, where the IMF and World Bank go into third world countries, buy off the leadership, have them sign on to globalist private debts, bankrupt the country, and then a nation like Nigeria can get a billion dollar loan, you know, in 1979, and now they've paid back something like 90 billion on a billion dollars.
[00:17:33.502 --> 00:17:35.942]  And it's impossible to ever pay it back.
[00:17:35.962 --> 00:17:43.264]  And then finally you hear, well, now you owe another $100 billion on the $90 billion that you've already paid us off $1 billion.
[00:17:45.444 --> 00:17:47.384]  So we're going to have debt forgivance.
[00:17:47.424 --> 00:17:49.525]  And the media is all, how nice.
[00:17:50.465 --> 00:17:55.046]  Lord Rothschild called for it, or Bill Gates called for it, or Davos called for it.
[00:17:55.066 --> 00:17:56.146]  They go, that's right.
[00:17:56.286 --> 00:18:01.367]  All your water, all your roads, your infrastructure, turn it over to us and we'll forgive your debt.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.401]  And we're like, oh, we gave it to them for free!
[00:18:05.921 --> 00:18:06.942]  They get everything.
[00:18:07.422 --> 00:18:15.986]  You pay hundreds of percentage points in interest in the aggregate, in the compounding interest, and they call it a moratorium.
[00:18:20.828 --> 00:18:23.970]  What's the biblical term when you forgive a debt?
[00:18:27.652 --> 00:18:28.952]  It'll pop in my mind in a moment.
[00:18:29.012 --> 00:18:32.174]  Biblical term for the jubilee.
[00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:35.950]  Yes, yes, we're giving you a jubilee!
[00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:50.396]  We loaned you, in one case it was a billion dollar, with Brazil it was like 10 billion or something, loaned them in the 80s and then they paid back like 70 something billion and then finally refused to say, we're not paying anymore, you've been paid.
[00:18:51.584 --> 00:18:53.986]  And then finally they've had a better economy since they did that.
[00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.268]  This is debt bondage.
[00:18:57.028 --> 00:18:58.089]  This is how this runs.
[00:18:58.129 --> 00:19:00.331]  This is why Mexico is so enslaved.
[00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:08.417]  It's why they always devalue their peso as a weapon against their peasants, as a weapon against their middle class, and it's the same weapon here.
[00:19:09.178 --> 00:19:15.203]  Mexico has more billionaires per capita for 120 million citizens, look it up, than any other country in the world.
[00:19:17.166 --> 00:19:19.508]  I mean, they're nouveau riche elite.
[00:19:19.568 --> 00:19:21.610]  They live on 100,000 acre ranches and palaces.
[00:19:24.172 --> 00:19:27.674]  You know, with jet copters and homes in Switzerland.
[00:19:28.755 --> 00:19:31.117]  And they have one of the poorest populations in the world.
[00:19:31.377 --> 00:19:34.360]  By design, it's not like that's an accident there.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.202]  And they're going to take our bank accounts here, too.
[00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:38.263]  That's all been announced.
[00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:40.427]  That's what Homeland Security's for.
[00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:43.488]  That's what the drones and checkpoints and, oh, U.S.
[00:19:43.528 --> 00:19:46.129]  intelligence agencies look at every American's bank account.
[00:19:46.189 --> 00:19:46.609]  Reuters.
[00:19:48.249 --> 00:19:49.590]  Flaunting it in your face.
[00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:56.552]  And those of us that criticize the New World Order, we're listed as terrorists by the Southern Poverty Law Center, who then advises the police.
[00:19:56.952 --> 00:20:01.053]  We're going to break down what this takeover means and how we can stop it on the other side.
[00:20:01.872 --> 00:20:06.316]  Nothing is more American than diamond gusset jeans.
[00:20:06.336 --> 00:20:07.938]  100% American made since 1987.
[00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:14.344]  Soft and broken in from the start, yet more rugged and durable than any jean you've ever worn.
[00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:17.667]  Have you ever experienced missized jeans from China?
[00:20:18.027 --> 00:20:19.649]  Well, you won't with diamond gusset.
[00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.574]  Every pair is crafted to fit exactly the same and always feel like they were custom made.
[00:20:25.274 --> 00:20:26.915]  Need a 35, 37, or 39 waist?
[00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:29.435]  How about a 31 inseam?

[00:21:07.229 --> 00:21:08.329]  We need assistance.
[00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.210]  Please!
[00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.771]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:16.432]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:19.192]  While the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:21:19.472 --> 00:21:21.793]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:21:21.993 --> 00:21:25.574]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.

[00:22:02.563 --> 00:22:05.406]  Ceramic body armor is rated to stop six hits.
[00:22:05.666 --> 00:22:06.807]  But what about the seventh?
[00:22:07.047 --> 00:22:11.070]  Unlike ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel body armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[00:22:11.271 --> 00:22:12.572]  And it just won't quit.

[00:22:30.407 --> 00:22:39.673]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:40.454]  This capitalism?
[00:22:40.534 --> 00:22:46.658]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:47.619]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:24:16.266 --> 00:24:32.942]  Last week, Bebe Grillo warns that Italy will be dropped like a hot potato, and that Mario Monti, who was installed by the IMF and World Bank and the EU, was a bankruptcy receiver to implode the country.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.702]  And he has been proven correct on that front.
[00:24:38.223 --> 00:24:41.845]  Here are the headlines up at Infowars.com.
[00:24:42.005 --> 00:24:48.809]  Banking chief calls for 15% looting of Italian savings and the United States per capita
[00:24:49.409 --> 00:24:59.394]  Has, by some estimates, more public debt and more debt we've signed on to that's the banker's debt, most of this is not our debt, than even Italy does.
[00:24:59.454 --> 00:25:03.056]  And Italy's about as bad as it gets with their big socialist welfare state.
[00:25:03.096 --> 00:25:09.919]  And again, they get you into that position and de-industrialize your country so that you don't have a choice.
[00:25:12.749 --> 00:25:19.934]  So that you don't have jobs, you don't have a way to work, you don't have an economy, so you basically have to go get government food stamps.
[00:25:20.354 --> 00:25:21.955]  You have to be on a government card.
[00:25:22.315 --> 00:25:24.116]  You have to be on government disability.
[00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:34.683]  And then once they have enough people working for corporations that get government contracts and bailouts, or on welfare, or in the criminal justice system, or in the psychiatric system, it's game over.
[00:25:35.731 --> 00:25:37.452]  This is how they enslave people.
[00:25:37.832 --> 00:25:47.197]  And now because of manufacturing and robotics, they can have big giant factories manufacture baubles to basically buy off the population for the new status symbols.
[00:25:47.618 --> 00:25:49.138]  And people will sell their souls.
[00:25:49.479 --> 00:25:51.580]  People will sell their souls for a fake idea.
[00:25:52.654 --> 00:26:16.453]  They'll go pay, you know, $8,000, $10,000 to attend a TED conference and then stay in a dormitory like a cult member to make hundreds of millions of dollars for TED, the conference, so they can then push globalism on people and imply that all the cutting-edge stuff they talk about is part of the ideology when all they're doing is using all the interesting people they have at the TED conference
[00:26:18.356 --> 00:26:25.154]  To draw people in and then force-feed the globalist, collectivist, neoliberal system into them.
[00:26:26.411 --> 00:26:27.772]  And you ask, what does that have to do with any of this?
[00:26:27.812 --> 00:26:35.159]  You know, I was listening to talk radio this morning and they had caller after caller this new study the RNC did about how they've got to get with the times or they're over.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:42.025]  And it was Democrats calling and celebrating, going, I'm a white man, but let me tell you, the age of the white people's over.
[00:26:42.546 --> 00:26:44.127]  The Democrats are inclusive.
[00:26:44.187 --> 00:26:44.908]  We're winning.
[00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:50.593]  And we'd start laughing and then the hosts were all, oh my gosh, what are we going to do?
[00:26:51.334 --> 00:26:52.535]  Oh, like buying into it.
[00:26:55.022 --> 00:27:00.888]  The Bill of Rights, Constitution, private property, not having foreign banks running you, has nothing to do with white men.
[00:27:01.633 --> 00:27:05.536]  But they put it out like, oh, the age of the white man's over.
[00:27:05.576 --> 00:27:06.777]  You hear that all over the news.
[00:27:06.797 --> 00:27:11.561]  And it's like, I love Obama, I'm white, and I joined the winning team, or I'm Hispanic.
[00:27:12.021 --> 00:27:21.008]  And meanwhile, he's doubling your insurance premiums, bankrupting everything for foreign megabanks, carpet bombing all over the world, drone attacks.
[00:27:21.048 --> 00:27:23.610]  But it's like this projection.
[00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:26.733]  Oh, I'm part of the winning team.
[00:27:29.605 --> 00:27:31.926]  And you'll talk to people that have Barack Obama bumper stickers.
[00:27:31.986 --> 00:27:33.647]  I do it at gas stations and stuff.
[00:27:33.667 --> 00:27:36.069]  You walk over and I'll go, hey, so Obama won.
[00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:37.530]  And they'll go, that's right.
[00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.851]  And I'll go, so tell me what you feel about it.
[00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:41.232]  I'm just feeling really good.
[00:27:41.872 --> 00:27:43.413]  Well, I mean, what's a Democratic Party do?
[00:27:43.813 --> 00:27:45.474]  Well, the age of the white man's over.
[00:27:47.756 --> 00:27:48.996]  That's what these callers were saying.
[00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:51.398]  These were white people because the hosts were asking them.
[00:27:52.519 --> 00:27:53.939]  And it was just bizarre.
[00:27:54.019 --> 00:27:56.261]  Like, we're part of the winning liberal club.
[00:27:57.612 --> 00:28:05.129]  And it's like we're now in the, what would you call it, country club.
[00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:08.195]  It's like people have their elitist country clubs.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:17.623]  And they go to those, and they just sit around the country club in the lounge area by the restaurant.
[00:28:17.643 --> 00:28:23.566]  And they just sit there all day at a table, just with their chins up and their noses up.
[00:28:24.506 --> 00:28:26.027]  Oh, I finally arrived.
[00:28:26.067 --> 00:28:33.110]  And they snobbishly talk about how much money each person has that walks into the country club.
[00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:33.690]  I know.
[00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.351]  I've been in plenty of them.
[00:28:37.142 --> 00:28:39.603]  Growing up, you know, visiting friends and family.
[00:28:40.564 --> 00:28:41.845]  And that's the same thing.
[00:28:41.865 --> 00:28:44.186]  The media says, you're a part of Ted.
[00:28:44.766 --> 00:28:45.387]  You're a winner.
[00:28:45.427 --> 00:28:46.688]  You're a part of the Democratic Party.
[00:28:47.048 --> 00:28:47.248]  Why?
[00:28:47.288 --> 00:28:50.490]  You're white, but you've denounced it and have ushered in.
[00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.931]  And then you're like, yes, whites are evil.
[00:28:52.691 --> 00:29:21.386]  I'll do whatever Obama says, which is massive tax increases on the poor, tax exemption for the ultra-rich, eugenics-based health care, totally open borders, draconian destruction of the Bill of Rights, warrantless wiretapping, torture, black sites, secret arrest, forced abortions worldwide, forced GMO, no labeling of aspartame, arresting people for marijuana, TSA checkpoints on the highways, just abject tyranny, but you know what?
[00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:23.259]  Woo-hoo!
[00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:24.140]  I'm feeling good!
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.020]  The media told me I'm winning!
[00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:30.983]  And it was just like Republicans did when Bush was in there, like, I don't care what he does.
[00:29:31.443 --> 00:29:32.663]  I don't care if he tortures people.
[00:29:33.044 --> 00:29:34.524]  I don't care if he... You know what?
[00:29:35.465 --> 00:29:36.025]  We're winners.
[00:29:36.065 --> 00:29:38.386]  We're Republicans, and you stupid liberals have lost.
[00:29:38.666 --> 00:29:39.546]  Ah-ha, ah-ha.
[00:29:39.987 --> 00:29:41.227]  It's like childlike.
[00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:49.031]  I'm gonna give the number out and take some calls when we come back on the economic issue, and I'm gonna drill into it in depth and tell you what's coming next.
[00:29:49.051 --> 00:29:49.511]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:53.712]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.632 --> 00:29:57.433]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.615 --> 00:30:04.336]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:30:04.616 --> 00:30:09.457]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:30:09.638 --> 00:30:16.800]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:22.367]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:26.311]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[00:33:10.447 --> 00:33:14.593]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:15.354 --> 00:33:16.795]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.505 --> 00:33:29.930]  So I specifically want to hear from stockbrokers, investors, people that own gold.
[00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:32.013]  What's your view on what's happening with the economy?
[00:33:32.453 --> 00:33:35.716]  People always ask me, Alex, why do you want to own gold and silver?
[00:33:35.956 --> 00:33:36.237]  I don't know.
[00:33:36.297 --> 00:33:38.759]  I started buying silver when it was $4, $5 an ounce.
[00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:42.843]  It went up to almost 50, went down to 30-something, never sold any of it.
[00:33:43.644 --> 00:33:45.206]  Because it's my emergency backup.
[00:33:45.866 --> 00:33:46.927]  I don't have that much of it.
[00:33:47.188 --> 00:33:49.310]  I don't have that much savings, period.
[00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:56.817]  I put almost all the money I make back into this InfoWars operation to resist the globalists because there's no future if we don't beat them.
[00:33:57.538 --> 00:34:00.141]  My investment is in defeating the New World Order.
[00:34:00.581 --> 00:34:02.123]  That's what I'm really going after.
[00:34:03.336 --> 00:34:04.617]  But I do have gold and silver.
[00:34:05.277 --> 00:34:06.157]  I bought firearms.
[00:34:06.197 --> 00:34:14.922]  You know, I bought a Barrett .50 caliber rifle many years ago that went from like $3,000 to $20,000 today.
[00:34:16.102 --> 00:34:17.843]  Last year I said I better buy another one.
[00:34:17.923 --> 00:34:18.103]  It was $5,000.
[00:34:18.244 --> 00:34:19.464]  It's now $25,000.
[00:34:19.604 --> 00:34:29.489]  I've told people invest in guns, invest in gold and silver, invest in real estate in the right area, invest in
[00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.671]  Farmland that is profitable.
[00:34:34.751 --> 00:34:38.492]  That's what I've been telling people for 17 years on air.
[00:34:38.612 --> 00:34:40.133]  And it's not because I'm some genius.
[00:34:40.773 --> 00:34:43.334]  It's because I studied what the globalists are actually doing.
[00:34:43.634 --> 00:34:53.998]  While bad-mouthing owning farmland, while bad-mouthing owning gold and silver, while bad-mouthing having storable foods, while bad-mouthing owning guns, that's what they own.
[00:34:56.741 --> 00:34:57.761]  That's what they're into.
[00:34:58.342 --> 00:34:59.122]  That's what they do.
[00:34:59.462 --> 00:35:02.263]  I talked to a major defense contractor who was leaving the U.S.
[00:35:02.283 --> 00:35:02.963]  five years ago.
[00:35:03.743 --> 00:35:04.984]  I've told the story many times.
[00:35:06.324 --> 00:35:10.666]  And the person was telling me this, and I'm talking to him, and I'll go back and search engine him later, and it's them.
[00:35:11.926 --> 00:35:14.287]  And they said, I think you're going to be getting real big.
[00:35:14.307 --> 00:35:16.928]  You're going to be getting real popular if you stay alive.
[00:35:16.968 --> 00:35:17.488]  And I said, why?
[00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:20.969]  They said, you're dead on, dead on, dead on.
[00:35:25.083 --> 00:35:26.247]  Dead on, dead on.
[00:35:26.307 --> 00:35:29.637]  And this person was worth three and a half billion dollars the time I looked him up.
[00:35:31.835 --> 00:35:41.117]  And my point is, the power structure is sitting here telling you don't do all these things.
[00:35:41.177 --> 00:35:58.020]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL are putting out reports saying there is no world government, there is no new world order, there is no bank run coming, there is no global devaluation, there is no two billion bullets, there are no armored vehicles, there are no checkpoints, even though they're all over the local news.
[00:35:59.193 --> 00:36:08.044]  And they're doing this because they cannot have a public debate about it until they finally have a trigger event to blame the financial collapse on.
[00:36:08.564 --> 00:36:14.151]  And I've said that's probably in my gut would be something like a low-yield newt going off in Chicago.
[00:36:15.407 --> 00:36:17.129]  And people ask, why do you say Chicago?
[00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:19.711]  Chicago, Dallas, Cleveland.
[00:36:20.532 --> 00:36:28.579]  Because the CFR likes to brag, and they've said in three different reports, Dallas, Cleveland, Chicago, and Denver.
[00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:29.660]  They've also said Denver.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:41.190]  And they just keep saying that, and then over the weekend they had a radiation alert on the subway trains in Illinois, and freaked out, had another one in another place, and helicopters flying around.
[00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:47.253]  And I've seen it in movies and film, and they just always tell you what they're going to do before they do it.
[00:36:47.773 --> 00:36:55.456]  And there's about a hundred other points that go into that, conservatively, but... And they don't care if I get up here and say they're going to nuke Chicago.
[00:36:55.476 --> 00:36:59.118]  They'll just say, oh, he didn't really say that.
[00:36:59.758 --> 00:37:06.621]  He said that after the fact on video, and said that it was a, you know, said in 2013.
[00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:09.723]  But it was, you know, he didn't really say that.
[00:37:11.213 --> 00:37:12.454]  And you'll be like, well, I heard him say it.
[00:37:12.494 --> 00:37:15.335]  No, look, this YouTube is from the time.
[00:37:15.355 --> 00:37:18.177]  Oh, that's a fake timestamp.
[00:37:18.197 --> 00:37:19.998]  He didn't predict 9-11.
[00:37:20.858 --> 00:37:26.341]  He didn't say they'll blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on Bin Laden on July 25, 2001.
[00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:38.398]  Toll-free number to join us, because I want your take on all of this.
[00:37:38.418 --> 00:37:39.099]  800-259-9231.
[00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:42.261]  800-259-9231.
[00:37:42.881 --> 00:37:49.466]  First-time callers, I want to get your financial, your take on what's happening.
[00:37:50.066 --> 00:38:00.854]  Now, the reason I get into gold and silver, and I guess I should plug my resources here, is because they're the trusted name who I've been buying from and working with 16 years now.
[00:38:02.341 --> 00:38:05.503]  Is because people say, well, they could confiscate your gold and silver.
[00:38:06.023 --> 00:38:08.104]  Yeah, they could come try to take my kids too.
[00:38:08.804 --> 00:38:10.545]  I mean, I still had three children.
[00:38:11.846 --> 00:38:13.506]  I'd have more if I could talk my wife into it.
[00:38:16.088 --> 00:38:22.091]  But the issue here is that it's harder for them to come take gold and silver.
[00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:26.873]  It's harder for them than it is to just take it out of your bank account.
[00:38:29.315 --> 00:38:30.957]  But I always love the defeatist attitude.
[00:38:31.458 --> 00:38:39.387]  And it's because of the defeatist attitude that The Globalist have announced first 10, now 12% of the bank accounts
[00:38:41.104 --> 00:38:46.788]  And even though the Parliament of Cyprus won't vote to do it, they're moving ahead with the plan, Reuters is reporting.
[00:38:47.389 --> 00:38:54.674]  And now they're saying, don't worry, if you don't have a lot of money in the bank, you know, less than 10,000 euros, we'll only take 7% now.
[00:38:55.474 --> 00:38:57.036]  Isn't that nice of them?
[00:38:57.096 --> 00:39:00.198]  See, first, oh, we're going to take 10, take 12, oh, only 7.
[00:39:00.818 --> 00:39:01.639]  Oh, that's reasonable.
[00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:02.580]  And they're calling it a tax.
[00:39:04.178 --> 00:39:12.126]  Just like forcing you to buy Obamacare doubles the rate the first year, it's set to triple it by 2015.
[00:39:12.366 --> 00:39:16.070]  That's the insurance consortium of lobbyists to put that out.
[00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:20.254]  It's now doubling in 2013 as we told you three years ago it would do.
[00:39:20.294 --> 00:39:22.956]  That's what their own Congressional Budget Office predicted.
[00:39:23.517 --> 00:39:24.838]  Because they can make you buy it now.
[00:39:24.858 --> 00:39:26.580]  And you're like, but it's going to kill businesses.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.582]  It's going to make people lay everybody off.
[00:39:30.254 --> 00:39:32.436]  And make everybody go part-time so they're exempt.
[00:39:32.756 --> 00:39:33.617]  That's part of the plan.
[00:39:33.977 --> 00:39:38.902]  And then when you can't pay your bills because you're part-time, you're going to go on the digital welfare card.
[00:39:39.562 --> 00:39:42.805]  And now they're going to say you're off your welfare card if you don't take all the shots.
[00:39:44.307 --> 00:39:46.308]  And then you're going to wonder why your kid dies when they're 12.
[00:39:47.816 --> 00:39:49.337]  After they've had 300, 400 shots.
[00:39:49.898 --> 00:39:50.558]  That's what it is now.
[00:39:50.598 --> 00:39:52.219]  They try to give you 20, 30 shots a year.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.421]  The average shot has three different things in it.
[00:39:54.761 --> 00:39:56.303]  It's in the hundreds of shots now.
[00:39:57.043 --> 00:39:58.364]  The kids are walking dead.
[00:39:58.404 --> 00:39:59.745]  I can see death in their faces.
[00:40:00.125 --> 00:40:01.567]  I can hardly go to a restaurant now.
[00:40:02.007 --> 00:40:05.970]  You'll see some beautiful woman with her husband and these children.
[00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:09.553]  You can look into their faces and see the death on them.
[00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:10.874]  You can see the shadows.
[00:40:11.574 --> 00:40:12.935]  You can see it in their bone structure.
[00:40:12.955 --> 00:40:14.316]  You can see the coloration.
[00:40:14.696 --> 00:40:19.058]  You can see where their connective tissues leaning in on their bone structure.
[00:40:19.078 --> 00:40:22.680]  I mean, I can see the death in their little twinkly eyes.
[00:40:22.981 --> 00:40:24.021]  And I'm supposed to like that.
[00:40:24.081 --> 00:40:24.601]  Well, you know what?
[00:40:24.621 --> 00:40:25.142]  I don't like it.
[00:40:26.623 --> 00:40:31.205]  I don't like watching their little twinkly eyes twinkle that much brighter because they're being killed.
[00:40:35.408 --> 00:40:37.329]  The eyes twinkle the closer you get to death.
[00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.789]  Did you know that?
[00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:47.154]  Even if you've been dumbed down and have a glaze over your eyes and you've been dying a long time, ever been around somebody a day before they die?
[00:40:47.174 --> 00:40:48.935]  Ever been there right when they die?
[00:40:48.955 --> 00:40:50.675]  Ever looked into their eyes?
[00:40:50.715 --> 00:41:04.678]  The fire, the fire, the fire of intellect, the fire of the spirit, the fire of a body that had a mission and was meant to do things, the fire of the ancestral memory of what we are and all that we've been through together.
[00:41:05.738 --> 00:41:12.564]  Allowing ourselves to be captured by a bunch of insane scientists playing games with us like we're animals?
[00:41:12.584 --> 00:41:13.424]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:14.805 --> 00:41:17.407]  First-time callers on financial issues.
[00:41:18.448 --> 00:41:20.009]  So they've got a bank holiday.
[00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:22.191]  It's a holiday, yeah!
[00:41:22.551 --> 00:41:25.334]  To quote Gerald Cilente, it's one of those holidays.
[00:41:25.874 --> 00:41:28.476]  New Freedom Initiative to force drug half the kids in America.
[00:41:28.716 --> 00:41:29.537]  It's a new freedom.
[00:41:29.777 --> 00:41:33.920]  The Patriot Act to secretly arrest you and break into your house without warrants and if you catch them,
[00:41:34.841 --> 00:41:38.765]  And you speak out ten years in prison, arresting members of the press that expose corruption.
[00:41:39.085 --> 00:41:40.507]  It's a holiday!
[00:41:40.947 --> 00:41:43.090]  Yeah, I want to go on a holiday.
[00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.692]  I want to dance a little bit.
[00:41:45.712 --> 00:41:47.714]  A little rockabilly dance there.
[00:41:47.814 --> 00:41:49.436]  It's a holiday!
[00:41:49.856 --> 00:41:51.218]  Like Frank Sinatra would say.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.681]  Sounds like a great holiday to me.
[00:41:56.394 --> 00:42:01.058]  You go on a holiday, and let's say you've shaved up 200-300,000 euros for retirement.
[00:42:01.339 --> 00:42:11.808]  Everybody, retirees, cops, fire department, all you people that serve the system, bureaucrats, all of you, you can't get any money out of the bank.
[00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:17.794]  Notice they waited until Friday when the automatic transfers went in.
[00:42:18.746 --> 00:42:21.007]  They've got regulations in Europe where they basically force you to do that.
[00:42:21.027 --> 00:42:21.707]  They're trying that here.
[00:42:21.727 --> 00:42:23.928]  It's the automatic cash transfer.
[00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:26.288]  Your check goes in, and you go to get it.
[00:42:26.308 --> 00:42:29.409]  They're like, sorry, the bank's closed on Saturday and Sunday.
[00:42:29.429 --> 00:42:31.530]  They have something open on Sunday in Cyprus.
[00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:32.390]  Oh, sorry, it's closed.
[00:42:33.251 --> 00:42:34.591]  Sorry, you can't get any money out.
[00:42:34.951 --> 00:42:37.032]  You can get 50 euros out of the ATM.
[00:42:37.172 --> 00:42:38.332]  Oh, it's run out of money.
[00:42:39.133 --> 00:42:40.813]  It's a holiday.
[00:42:41.353 --> 00:42:43.374]  Everybody wants to go on a holiday.
[00:42:43.914 --> 00:42:46.175]  Gee, I wish we'd get one of those holidays around here.
[00:42:47.253 --> 00:42:48.875]  And don't worry, you'll get your holiday.
[00:42:50.217 --> 00:42:51.238]  You'll get your holiday.
[00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:56.645]  And I love how they got paid trolls on InfoWars.com in these articles saying this isn't happening.
[00:42:57.639 --> 00:42:59.040]  And we can track the IP addresses.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.501]  They are bots, most of them.
[00:43:01.022 --> 00:43:05.465]  Some of them appear to be humans, but they go back to Defense Department computers and others.
[00:43:05.485 --> 00:43:06.566]  They don't even hide it now.
[00:43:07.106 --> 00:43:13.651]  You know, that 73% of Obama's Twitters are fake and Department of Defense run and Media Matters is Department of Defense, basically.
[00:43:14.072 --> 00:43:14.492]  All of this.
[00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:15.613]  It's just funny to them.
[00:43:16.053 --> 00:43:16.474]  And you know what?
[00:43:16.494 --> 00:43:18.095]  You're going to get your bank account taken, too.
[00:43:18.575 --> 00:43:19.336]  But you don't care.
[00:43:19.556 --> 00:43:21.037]  Your kid's going to die of cancer, too.
[00:43:21.117 --> 00:43:21.758]  You don't care.
[00:43:21.778 --> 00:43:23.459]  It's a holiday!
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.240]  There's no drones.
[00:43:26.237 --> 00:43:33.999]  I mean, everybody knows Mad Dog Ben Richards is the brutal murderer at Bakersfield and committed murder there and the government stopped him.
[00:43:34.719 --> 00:43:36.940]  And now he's gonna be paying for it on The Running Man.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.240]  I mean, you know, you saw the TV.
[00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:39.881]  Mad Dog Ben Richards, he did it.
[00:43:40.281 --> 00:43:41.641]  And who loves you and who do you love?
[00:43:41.922 --> 00:43:42.822]  The Running Man!
[00:43:43.042 --> 00:43:47.503]  The number one television show in the whole wide world!
[00:43:50.684 --> 00:43:53.205]  So I would give Midas Resources a call.
[00:43:54.434 --> 00:44:05.138]  And I would take advantage, only one order per person, for two turn-of-the-last-century, 100-year-old, silver dollars, with an Obama deception and an animated film that's high quality.
[00:44:05.178 --> 00:44:06.478]  I mean, it's like Hollywood quality.
[00:44:06.838 --> 00:44:11.580]  American Dream, that's a $40 free gift, and each film $20.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.862]  And then a $20 book, Dishonest Money, a book and two films and free shipping.
[00:44:17.882 --> 00:44:19.784]  That's usually $10, so that's $60, $70.
[00:44:20.485 --> 00:44:26.631]  That's $70 free, $72 shipping included for two silver dollars at cost.
[00:44:27.491 --> 00:44:29.173]  As a loss looter, to get you introduced to it, 800-686-2237.
[00:44:29.193 --> 00:44:29.333]  800-686-2237.
[00:44:29.373 --> 00:44:31.275]  Our great sponsor that helps us get the word out.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.901]  And of course, the brokers will be happy to send you 10 Reasons to Own Gold, the free booklet as well.
[00:44:42.462 --> 00:44:45.282]  And while you're there, ask them about some of the day's gold and silver specials.
[00:44:45.703 --> 00:44:48.644]  From junk silver, right on up to bullion, right on up to collectibles.
[00:44:49.224 --> 00:44:51.104]  And they've got the best deals on collectibles as well.
[00:44:51.225 --> 00:44:51.945]  Ask them about it all.
[00:44:51.985 --> 00:44:54.826]  Canadian maple leafs, British sovereigns, all of it.
[00:44:56.134 --> 00:44:58.717]  800-686-2237, 800-686-237, 800-686-237.
[00:44:59.318 --> 00:45:03.422]  You know what I'll do?
[00:45:03.462 --> 00:45:09.167]  I'll go to your calls right now, and then I'm going to drill into this economic news and break down what it means, but bottom line, it's this.
[00:45:09.768 --> 00:45:12.351]  If you grovel to the power structure,
[00:45:13.758 --> 00:45:17.459]  If you just accept anything they want, if you think that's what gets you ahead in life.
[00:45:17.859 --> 00:45:30.004]  People think it's a virtue to be stupid, a virtue to be ill-informed, a virtue to not care, a virtue to laugh at tyranny, as you live on the fumes of liberty that our ancestors viciously fought and killed for.
[00:45:30.564 --> 00:45:33.245]  Our ancestors killed a lot of people.
[00:45:34.285 --> 00:45:43.008]  I mean, the biggest military the world had ever seen that had beaten the Dutch and the French and the Spanish and the Portuguese who had empires all over the world.
[00:45:44.249 --> 00:45:46.691]  And who had beaten the Russians and everybody else.
[00:45:47.512 --> 00:45:51.636]  Our ancestors beat them and beat everybody else to have a little bit of liberty.
[00:45:52.236 --> 00:46:03.967]  And they were such vicious animals, philosopher kings, that they built a civilization where 4% of the world's population had over half the wealth.
[00:46:04.027 --> 00:46:08.151]  And it actually went to a middle class, which others could then enjoy from around the world.
[00:46:08.171 --> 00:46:09.072]  So everybody wanted to get here.
[00:46:11.232 --> 00:46:14.955]  And now, folks, we've been taught lay down, be cowardly, grovel.
[00:46:14.975 --> 00:46:17.017]  I mean, I go to places and I look at the average men.
[00:46:18.018 --> 00:46:24.384]  And I used to get threatened at a subconscious level by guys with tattoos and big arms and, you know, trying to act tough and acting.
[00:46:24.404 --> 00:46:25.385]  You know what?
[00:46:25.405 --> 00:46:26.686]  Now I admire those guys.
[00:46:27.307 --> 00:46:28.968]  At least they're trying to be manly.
[00:46:29.529 --> 00:46:32.571]  At least they understand it's important to be an alpha male.
[00:46:33.852 --> 00:46:35.354]  Guys think, oh, you think you're really tough.
[00:46:35.394 --> 00:46:36.435]  You're trying to act tough.
[00:46:37.416 --> 00:46:40.979]  And then I would sit there and, you know, think about, well, I got in a fight with him, this would happen.
[00:46:41.439 --> 00:46:42.620]  Because, you know, I'm primitive as well.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.361]  Now I realize at least they're trying to be men.
[00:46:44.861 --> 00:46:46.082]  And they're bucking the whole system.
[00:46:46.283 --> 00:46:47.904]  So I salute you on your Harleys!
[00:46:48.164 --> 00:46:49.125]  I salute you!
[00:46:49.425 --> 00:46:51.006]  I salute you and your street fighting!
[00:46:51.246 --> 00:46:52.607]  I salute the UFC!
[00:46:52.907 --> 00:46:53.548]  I salute it!
[00:46:54.008 --> 00:46:58.050]  Because at least, you know, a lot of it's corrupt and bad, but it's better than what we've got.
[00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:03.713]  This nanny state of toddling men walking around just with a spirit of weakness in them.
[00:47:04.033 --> 00:47:07.074]  I mean, I go and I look at people and they just want to be overrun.
[00:47:07.375 --> 00:47:08.835]  They want to be enslaved.
[00:47:08.855 --> 00:47:09.896]  They just, they love it.
[00:47:10.356 --> 00:47:12.097]  They love their wife bossing them around.
[00:47:12.137 --> 00:47:14.117]  They love walking behind their wife or girlfriend.
[00:47:14.357 --> 00:47:16.118]  They love groveling to the police.
[00:47:16.358 --> 00:47:17.919]  They love groveling to bureaucrats.
[00:47:17.979 --> 00:47:27.062]  And let me tell you, when you act like that, it's like going off the coast of San Diego for a month and dumping rotten fish heads and blood and rotten pig parts into the water.
[00:47:27.262 --> 00:47:28.142]  What do you think's gonna happen?
[00:47:28.443 --> 00:47:30.523]  A big, giant, great white shark's gonna show up.
[00:47:34.045 --> 00:47:34.885]  And it's gonna attack.
[00:47:36.752 --> 00:47:42.075]  It's like swimming in bloody water in the North Atlantic or in the South Pacific.
[00:47:42.355 --> 00:47:42.875]  Hammerheads.
[00:47:43.155 --> 00:47:44.296]  Tiger sharks are going to come.
[00:47:44.636 --> 00:47:47.417]  You're begging for a Mako to come and bite your leg off.
[00:47:47.717 --> 00:47:48.958]  I mean, you are begging.
[00:47:48.978 --> 00:47:52.380]  Listen, I know you've been taught going along gets you places.
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.381]  That was in the early takeover phase.
[00:47:54.641 --> 00:47:56.161]  That will not get you anywhere now.
[00:47:56.462 --> 00:48:01.264]  All you mercenaries that sold out and bought into the idea of this new world order.
[00:48:02.722 --> 00:48:03.743]  All right, let's go to phone calls.
[00:48:03.903 --> 00:48:04.743]  I'm out of control.
[00:48:05.064 --> 00:48:07.866]  Frank in Canada, he wants to talk about retirement funds.
[00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:09.067]  Yeah, I haven't gotten to that yet.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:13.690]  Yeah, they've changed rules worldwide, laws, to start taking your retirement funds.
[00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:15.531]  Congress has been having hearings on that.
[00:48:15.952 --> 00:48:17.113]  Canada's been talking about it.
[00:48:17.453 --> 00:48:29.702]  But I mean, hey, what's wrong with foreign banks taking your retirement fund, 10, 20 percent, and then more later, and giving it to themselves so they can have, some of these bankers have yachts the size of World War II battleships, literally.
[00:48:30.022 --> 00:48:30.923]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[00:48:31.283 --> 00:48:32.045]  I mean, that's liberal.
[00:48:32.065 --> 00:48:33.308]  You're not an extremist, are you?
[00:48:33.509 --> 00:48:36.677]  The Southern Poverty Law Center says if you criticize that, you're a terrorist.
[00:48:36.917 --> 00:48:40.145]  You're not one of those evil white males, are you, Frank?
[00:48:40.902 --> 00:48:46.083]  Oh no, goodness forbid that I would be, but you know, you hit the nail on the head today with what you're saying, and bravo for it.
[00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:49.384]  I mean, this is a classic divide-and-conquer strategy.
[00:48:49.444 --> 00:48:54.065]  Notice how they do this in smaller countries first, like Cyprus and Greece, kind of field testing.
[00:48:54.485 --> 00:48:58.005]  Here in Canada, I mean, we have a very similar program to what's in the U.S.
[00:48:58.025 --> 00:49:00.446]  with our 401ks and IRAs and so forth.
[00:49:00.806 --> 00:49:10.548]  There's already the discussion that, you know, a small segment of people have been saving diligently, putting money away, that maybe, just maybe, we should be looking at smoothing out the risk,
[00:49:10.968 --> 00:49:11.329]  We're good.
[00:49:23.542 --> 00:49:27.783]  All of a sudden, the people that did save, if their money is taking for them, who's going to complain?
[00:49:27.823 --> 00:49:29.143]  Because they're smoothing it out.
[00:49:29.503 --> 00:49:31.924]  And that's how they begin, and people got to get this idea.
[00:49:31.964 --> 00:49:42.766]  Oh no, this is a, at the grassroots, socialism leading into communism, with the globalists offshore exempt, transferring the lion's share, 90 plus percent, of it to themselves.
[00:49:43.106 --> 00:49:44.846]  It is unbelievable.
[00:49:44.947 --> 00:49:46.807]  And listen, they're going to take everything.
[00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:50.390]  And they're going to have people running around giggling, celebrating.
[00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:51.912]  As things collapse.
[00:49:52.613 --> 00:49:57.580]  But the dumbed-down masses won't even know their standard of living is collapsing, because it'll be done over years.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.623]  I mean, this has been done over and over again.
[00:50:00.024 --> 00:50:03.449]  This is the purposeful destruction of the Golden Goose.
[00:50:04.784 --> 00:50:05.204]  Absolutely.
[00:50:05.524 --> 00:50:08.905]  And you're seeing this now with Cyprus, which is kind of a beta test.
[00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:13.105]  It just wants to throw it out there, see what people think in the rest of the Western world.
[00:50:13.386 --> 00:50:15.626]  And I'm telling you, it's going to be coming to North America.
[00:50:15.666 --> 00:50:16.666]  You can already see it.
[00:50:17.006 --> 00:50:18.206]  They're already foreshadowing.
[00:50:18.526 --> 00:50:25.768]  Sure, they already have an Obamacare, what is it, 3.8% tax on investment funds after tax, after capital gains.
[00:50:25.788 --> 00:50:29.588]  They have a huge increase in payroll taxes on the poorest people.
[00:50:30.148 --> 00:50:31.769]  They've got all sorts of hidden taxes.
[00:50:31.809 --> 00:50:32.709]  I mean, they're doing it here.
[00:50:33.289 --> 00:50:33.750]  Absolutely.
[00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.011]  And then the economy stalls.
[00:50:35.451 --> 00:50:38.754]  And then their answer is more stimulus, which only they get to use.
[00:50:38.974 --> 00:50:39.494]  Absolutely.
[00:50:39.554 --> 00:50:40.235]  Well said, Frank.
[00:50:40.275 --> 00:50:40.595]  Thank you.
[00:50:41.096 --> 00:50:45.499]  Gerald, Travis, Aaron, John, your calls are coming up straight ahead.
[00:50:45.519 --> 00:50:53.506]  I mean, you heard the media when that golfer last year or this year said, hey, I'm paying 65% in taxes.
[00:50:53.526 --> 00:50:54.106]  That's too much.
[00:50:54.567 --> 00:50:55.527]  The media attacked him.
[00:50:55.568 --> 00:50:56.328]  He apologized.
[00:50:56.368 --> 00:50:57.189]  He said, you're right.
[00:50:57.529 --> 00:50:58.390]  I need to pay more than 65%.
[00:50:58.530 --> 00:50:59.291]  I'm a bad person.
[00:51:02.256 --> 00:51:05.758]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[00:51:06.038 --> 00:51:09.119]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:11.720]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:51:12.101 --> 00:51:14.041]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:51:14.242 --> 00:51:17.123]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[00:52:04.967 --> 00:52:08.270]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:11.172]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[00:52:11.333 --> 00:52:22.162]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[00:52:22.242 --> 00:52:23.303]  Then there's affordability.
[00:52:23.383 --> 00:52:24.404]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon,

[00:52:35.554 --> 00:52:38.356]  No need to be constantly replacing expensive filters with a Berkey.
[00:52:38.456 --> 00:52:40.818]  A single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.

[00:53:06.175 --> 00:53:09.096]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[00:53:09.356 --> 00:53:12.417]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[00:53:12.677 --> 00:53:24.060]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other tissues behave.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:28.761]  I learned I don't have to put up with disease, decay, or decline like I'd been conditioned to believe.
[00:53:29.062 --> 00:53:30.622]  I began taking RNA drops
[00:53:30.982 --> 00:53:36.787]  A 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy.
[00:53:37.007 --> 00:53:40.209]  Learn more about RNA drops and order a free sample today.

[00:54:18.678 --> 00:54:21.221]  Alex Jones here back live, going back to your calls.
[00:54:23.604 --> 00:54:28.349]  I'm gonna go through all the headlines when we start the next hour and then continue with calls ahead of a special guest joining us.
[00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:32.053]  But, it's really happening.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:42.606]  They are now arbitrarily, even though Cyprus wouldn't vote to do it, just announcing they're going ahead to grab 10% of everybody's bank account.
[00:54:42.967 --> 00:54:47.571]  And then they may do it more, and they're talking about doing it now in Italy and in other countries.
[00:54:47.611 --> 00:54:52.215]  In fact, let me punch up DrudgeReport.com for TV viewers.
[00:54:52.235 --> 00:54:53.116]  You can see it on screen.
[00:54:53.176 --> 00:54:54.317]  Radio listeners just go there.
[00:54:55.118 --> 00:54:56.639]  New EU bailout plan.
[00:54:56.699 --> 00:54:57.880]  Steal bank accounts.
[00:54:58.852 --> 00:55:01.953]  Island set to seize personal savings.
[00:55:02.514 --> 00:55:04.234]  Plan moves ahead as vote delayed.
[00:55:04.274 --> 00:55:05.155]  They just moved ahead.
[00:55:05.175 --> 00:55:05.955]  The banks are closed.
[00:55:05.995 --> 00:55:06.635]  Can't get your money.
[00:55:07.515 --> 00:55:09.236]  Putin says it's unfair, dangerous.
[00:55:10.377 --> 00:55:16.319]  And now they're talking about further, further bank runs around Europe.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:20.020]  Amazing.
[00:55:22.041 --> 00:55:23.042]  Amazing that
[00:55:24.361 --> 00:55:25.403]  All of this is happening.
[00:55:25.423 --> 00:55:26.945]  There's the Infowars.com link.
[00:55:27.005 --> 00:55:28.046]  Will Italy follow?
[00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:34.214]  They've got top German banking ministers calling for 15% from the Italians.
[00:55:35.556 --> 00:55:38.900]  And of course, it's rocked the stock markets worldwide, the Euro, the U.S.
[00:55:38.921 --> 00:55:41.224]  stock market, you name it, Dow has dropped.
[00:55:42.213 --> 00:55:46.556]  But the issue here is that this isn't just a tax, as they're calling it.
[00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:47.576]  It's arbitrary.
[00:55:48.017 --> 00:55:54.781]  It's the unelected EU bureaucracy that's now appointing presidents and prime ministers in places like Italy and Greece.
[00:55:54.921 --> 00:56:02.346]  And this is the technocratic model where a foreign banking cartel appoints your presidents, and they call it a global government.
[00:56:02.606 --> 00:56:11.232]  And then I go, hey, look at the Financial Times of London calling for a $100 trillion tax every 10 years paid to private banks to back up their derivatives.
[00:56:12.284 --> 00:56:18.309]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center comes out and says I'm insane, it doesn't exist, and I'm dangerous, and that white men are terrorists.
[00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:21.672]  Just to get us to all fight with each other.
[00:56:21.713 --> 00:56:23.094]  What does white men have to do with it?
[00:56:23.314 --> 00:56:25.996]  I guess it's old white men in Europe running the New World Order.
[00:56:26.417 --> 00:56:27.097]  It's bankers.
[00:56:27.177 --> 00:56:28.459]  I guess the Rothschilds are white.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.261]  I guess the Queen of England's white.
[00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:33.261]  I guess that's how they distract us.
[00:56:33.321 --> 00:56:35.202]  It's just like, hey, don't take my bank account.
[00:56:35.262 --> 00:56:36.082]  Shut up, racist!
[00:56:36.523 --> 00:56:37.403]  Hey, don't take my guns.
[00:56:37.463 --> 00:56:38.203]  Shut up, racist!
[00:56:38.683 --> 00:56:40.724]  Hey, I don't want you to double my insurance prices.
[00:56:41.084 --> 00:56:42.305]  This is a really bad scam.
[00:56:42.345 --> 00:56:43.225]  Shut up, racist!
[00:56:46.346 --> 00:56:47.627]  And then it works on people.
[00:56:47.647 --> 00:56:48.567]  I listen to talk radio.
[00:56:48.667 --> 00:56:51.968]  There's these new GOP reports that I'm going to cover later in the next hour.
[00:56:53.922 --> 00:56:54.922]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[00:56:54.982 --> 00:56:55.483]  In Oklahoma City?
[00:56:55.503 --> 00:56:55.843]  Yes sir, I just...
[00:57:19.838 --> 00:57:27.642]  We all know that this stuff's coming down the pipeline and we post stuff on Facebook and things like that and try to get the word out.
[00:57:28.343 --> 00:57:39.689]  But we need to sincerely set up a date or something and everybody go up to Washington and literally drag them people out of there.
[00:57:40.229 --> 00:57:41.290]  I'm not even kidding, man.
[00:57:43.735 --> 00:57:46.516]  Because sitting around and talking about it's not going to do anything.
[00:57:46.556 --> 00:58:09.484]  Well, see, they know it's going to get to that point, so then they're going to stage events up front, right at the point they know that we've won politically in the wake of, to then say we're violent, to try to crack down on us, and then have a civil war, which the IMF in its own documents says is part of the IMF riot plan, which then implodes confidence even more, and so then they come in and consolidate things to a greater extent.
[00:58:10.024 --> 00:58:12.325]  See, they know your common sense approach.
[00:58:12.725 --> 00:58:20.506]  That's why we've got to have this be an info war and navigate it, and then hold our fire until they openly start fights.
[00:58:21.166 --> 00:58:29.588]  But see, they know that, so they'll just stage things, blowing up, you know, government facilities that have child daycare centers in them to show dead kids on TV.
[00:58:29.628 --> 00:58:33.129]  In fact, when they blow stuff up, it will be a daycare in a federal facility.
[00:58:33.149 --> 00:58:34.729]  That's one of their favorite things to do.
[00:58:34.769 --> 00:58:38.590]  So we've got to be smarter, smarter than that, my friend, but I hear your frustration.
[00:58:44.415 --> 00:58:49.737]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.097 --> 00:58:55.578]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[00:58:55.879 --> 00:58:58.940]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.540]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.881]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:06.922]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.
[00:59:07.022 --> 00:59:10.104]  They have the best tasting long-term storable food on the planet.
[00:59:10.285 --> 00:59:14.208]  This food will taste just as great 25 years from now as it does tonight.

[00:59:54.516 --> 00:59:56.457]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.917 --> 00:59:59.699]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.243 --> 01:00:10.427]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.087 --> 01:00:11.888]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.669 --> 01:00:13.589]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:17.893]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.413 --> 01:00:20.755]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[01:00:21.636 --> 01:00:22.577]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.278 --> 01:00:40.673]  The globalists want a worldwide 100 trillion dollar every 10 year tax of FDRs on carbon taxes and every human activity to shut down the economy and transfer all wealth into their social engineering systems to remake society in a nightmare eugenics based system.
[01:00:41.654 --> 01:00:44.977]  The EU as I predicted, as Max Keiser predicted, as
[01:00:46.858 --> 01:00:52.380]  Gerald Cilente predicted is a receivership arm designed to implode Europe and consolidate it.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.661]  Paul Watson's written tons of articles on this.
[01:00:56.181 --> 01:01:01.562]  One of the more recent was, bankers declare they've conquered Europe in the United States and it breaks down where they plan this.
[01:01:01.942 --> 01:01:07.544]  And then I hear other people, socialists mainly, defending the EU because they like authoritarianism.
[01:01:07.904 --> 01:01:09.985]  And they say the bankers want to loot the euro.
[01:01:10.465 --> 01:01:13.866]  They built the euro to implode it into a greater euro.
[01:01:15.148 --> 01:01:17.749]  We need to get rid of the whole thing and go back to nation-states.
[01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:20.751]  Not new Soviet empires.
[01:01:21.251 --> 01:01:24.933]  The Euro is like the Soviet Union and is evil and must die.
[01:01:26.434 --> 01:01:27.834]  It politically must die.
[01:01:27.894 --> 01:01:28.975]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:01:28.995 --> 01:01:30.756]  I'm going to break all this down in this hour.
[01:01:31.116 --> 01:01:33.057]  John in New York, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:01:33.097 --> 01:01:33.417]  Welcome.
[01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:34.978]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:01:34.998 --> 01:01:35.978]  It's my first time calling.
[01:01:35.998 --> 01:01:36.879]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:01:37.419 --> 01:01:43.222]  Listen, you know, I listen to you a lot and I do my homework and you know, Gerald Flint, you know, he said it.
[01:01:43.777 --> 01:01:47.238]  No, get your three G's, your guns, gold, and your getaway plan, because you know what?
[01:01:47.258 --> 01:01:48.398]  That's what it's coming down to.
[01:01:48.418 --> 01:01:55.160]  No, this country is morally bankrupt, economically bankrupt, and this has been going on since the early 1900s, late 1800s.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.021]  Oh yeah, and the socialists now... I mean, I hear them and it's so bizarre.
[01:02:00.061 --> 01:02:01.641]  I think I'm in a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:02:01.661 --> 01:02:04.622]  They call into radio and laugh, and they're mainly white.
[01:02:05.342 --> 01:02:06.802]  It's this whole race-based thing.
[01:02:06.842 --> 01:02:08.003]  It's like a race obsession.
[01:02:08.023 --> 01:02:08.943]  I'm really sick of it.
[01:02:09.778 --> 01:02:15.663]  And they go, white people lost, Obama is winning, and it's a total screw job.
[01:02:15.944 --> 01:02:24.812]  Obama works for the mega-bank, same people as Romney, they're hammering everybody, but the, you know, one-tenth of one-one-hundredth, you know, the real super-clash.
[01:02:25.633 --> 01:02:32.899]  America, Europe's being imploded, the whole world's being imploded, and they call in giggling like a three-year-old going, nanny, nanny, boo-boo.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.243]  Stick your head in, you know, you know what?
[01:02:36.443 --> 01:02:38.846]  I mean, literally, adults, I'm sure you've heard them.
[01:02:39.106 --> 01:02:42.951]  I mean, they're like, nanny, nanny, boo-boo, we won, we won.
[01:02:43.592 --> 01:02:45.134]  Whitey is scared.
[01:02:45.234 --> 01:02:46.816]  And I'm like, what does that have to do with Whitey?
[01:02:46.856 --> 01:02:47.617]  And they go, Whitey!
[01:02:47.957 --> 01:02:48.558]  Whitey!
[01:02:48.578 --> 01:02:50.440]  And you're like, you mentally ill person, shut up!
[01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:53.523]  Mega banks are taking bank accounts, everybody's.
[01:02:54.143 --> 01:02:56.004]  I won, I won, I won.
[01:02:56.645 --> 01:03:00.928]  And they're like, I work for the government, or I work for a company, so what, so what.
[01:03:01.328 --> 01:03:04.490]  And they think if they imagine they're part of it, it makes them winners.
[01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:06.212]  It'd be like going out in the middle of the highway.
[01:03:06.952 --> 01:03:08.713]  With 18 wheelers going 80 miles an hour.
[01:03:09.234 --> 01:03:10.795]  They've upped the speed limit to that here in Texas.
[01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:15.057]  And going out on I-35 and just jumping in front of a car and going, I'm your friend!
[01:03:15.378 --> 01:03:16.078]  I'm your friend!
[01:03:16.298 --> 01:03:17.599]  And it just smashes you.
[01:03:17.639 --> 01:03:19.700]  The car slides over your guts.
[01:03:20.021 --> 01:03:21.242]  Your brains are all over the place.
[01:03:21.282 --> 01:03:23.483]  I've seen somebody hit by a car going like 70 miles an hour.
[01:03:23.703 --> 01:03:25.744]  Just splatters you unrecognizable.
[01:03:26.765 --> 01:03:27.546]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:03:28.166 --> 01:03:30.588]  The last thing in their mind is, I'm the car's friend!
[01:03:30.848 --> 01:03:31.329]  I'm a winner!
[01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.410]  You know, kinetic energy doesn't matter!
[01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.032]  Baby, love me car!
[01:03:35.232 --> 01:03:36.112]  Bell, love me!
[01:03:36.132 --> 01:03:38.314]  I mean, do you understand the mental illness I'm talking about here, sir?
[01:03:38.334 --> 01:03:38.674]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:40.696]  Alex, take it back a step, man.
[01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:42.397]  Lady Liberty's been hit by that bus.
[01:03:42.698 --> 01:03:46.080]  And she's splattered all over the highway with her guts hanging out.
[01:03:46.381 --> 01:03:48.262]  Let me tell you something about the men in this country.
[01:03:48.562 --> 01:03:50.164]  There are no men left in this country.
[01:03:50.484 --> 01:03:52.726]  Everybody talks, you know, Max Keiser said it the best.
[01:03:53.066 --> 01:03:54.647]  You know, you got your Second Amendment.
[01:03:55.008 --> 01:03:55.768]  What are you fighting for?
[01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:56.709]  The tradition for it?
[01:03:59.121 --> 01:04:03.905]  Well, Max overall I think is a good guy, but he also believes in global warming and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:04:03.925 --> 01:04:06.187]  He's always like, America's going to collapse, America's going to collapse.
[01:04:06.547 --> 01:04:07.408]  Well, what about the Euro?
[01:04:07.448 --> 01:04:08.849]  I've been saying it's going to collapse first.
[01:04:10.631 --> 01:04:13.093]  I know Max is listening, he says he listens religiously.
[01:04:13.133 --> 01:04:14.034]  The point is that
[01:04:16.004 --> 01:04:23.648]  Look, we've got to be fighting the info war viciously, ahead of not wanting to have a physical confrontation.
[01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:31.673]  But every day we fight, if there is going to be a physical confrontation, it's money in the political bank that we discredit the system.
[01:04:32.374 --> 01:04:33.594]  It's a life and death situation.
[01:04:33.614 --> 01:04:34.535]  I mean, what do you think we should do?
[01:04:36.561 --> 01:04:38.843]  If you don't take it straight, it's going to be a long unwinding.
[01:04:38.983 --> 01:04:41.465]  I mean, this has been going on since the early 1900s.
[01:04:41.505 --> 01:04:43.047]  They took over the education system.
[01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:45.629]  They took over our economic system, the Federal Reserve.
[01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:48.331]  I mean, it's going to take a long time to unwind it.
[01:04:48.611 --> 01:04:49.592]  We are way far down.
[01:04:49.612 --> 01:04:50.213]  You're right.
[01:04:50.233 --> 01:04:50.693]  You're right.
[01:04:50.713 --> 01:04:51.794]  I look at the average people.
[01:04:51.874 --> 01:04:53.576]  They are begging to be slaves.
[01:04:53.636 --> 01:04:57.880]  I mean, they are just shuffling around weakly, going, uh, uh, uh.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.281]  And they just worship government.
[01:04:59.461 --> 01:05:00.422]  They worship tyranny.
[01:05:02.091 --> 01:05:03.092]  I had tried everything.
[01:05:03.152 --> 01:05:08.239]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:05:08.659 --> 01:05:13.144]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:05:13.485 --> 01:05:19.853]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:30.799]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.682]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:05:36.022 --> 01:05:39.024]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[01:05:39.384 --> 01:05:42.045]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.

[01:08:11.167 --> 01:08:11.988]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.748 --> 01:08:13.728]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:17.910]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.491 --> 01:08:22.573]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.137 --> 01:08:46.520]  Well, the head of the big German central bank is calling for a 15% tax across the board on any country in the Euro that, quote, owes money to the private central banks.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:53.742]  And again, they owe the money because the governments since 2008 have publicly signed on from Japan to Germany.
[01:08:54.798 --> 01:09:01.021]  From Greece to the United States, from Canada to Australia, they've all signed on to too big to fail.
[01:09:01.702 --> 01:09:07.765]  And 92% on average of the debt worldwide is not humans' debt.
[01:09:08.325 --> 01:09:17.670]  Yeah, they tell you all day about the welfare debt, and the smart card debt, and the food stamp debt, and the college debt, and the government debt, and the county debt.
[01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:21.612]  That's all real, but they get you into that debt
[01:09:22.452 --> 01:09:25.294]  To then sign you on to their larger debts.
[01:09:25.975 --> 01:09:29.778]  And they get government to then invest the private pension funds.
[01:09:30.718 --> 01:09:32.900]  In many countries, they're taking over the private pension funds.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:36.543]  And the public pension funds in these derivatives.
[01:09:36.603 --> 01:09:37.384]  In fact, that happened.
[01:09:37.824 --> 01:09:42.367]  Guys, type in US pension funds invested to prop up too big to fail.
[01:09:42.748 --> 01:09:44.869]  Pension funds invested to prop up banks.
[01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:50.254]  And you'll see, no exaggeration, hundreds of articles in Europe, the United States,
[01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:58.761]  Where in the last four or five years, really accelerating the last two, it's just minor footnotes in AP, McClatchy, LA Times.
[01:09:59.342 --> 01:10:05.788]  Oh, your pension fund, private or public, was invested in Too Big to Fail.
[01:10:06.108 --> 01:10:16.458]  In fact, there was a big scandal when I saw headlines where private pension ordered to invest to prop up Too Big to Fail.
[01:10:17.785 --> 01:10:28.155]  And you'll see these articles where the heads of companies, CEOs are, well, I was ordered to invest the $25 billion of our people's money in this.
[01:10:28.175 --> 01:10:33.760]  Because the shareholders are saying, and the workers are saying, why did you invest in this?
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:34.861]  Well, I was ordered to.
[01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:40.727]  I mean, it's so insane that I can't even articulate all the angles of this, how bad it is.
[01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:45.526]  It's basically they have us being lowered into a wood chipper.
[01:10:45.826 --> 01:10:47.968]  And you're like, well, describe what a wood chipper is like.
[01:10:48.248 --> 01:10:48.708]  Well, you know what?
[01:10:48.768 --> 01:10:51.070]  I've never been put through one, so I don't know.
[01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:52.411]  It looks real bad.
[01:10:54.812 --> 01:10:56.774]  I've seen what it does to logs you put in it.
[01:10:57.414 --> 01:11:02.398]  I've seen what it does to third world countries, this type of shock therapy, IMF, World Bank takeover.
[01:11:02.678 --> 01:11:07.101]  And it is designed not to even bail us out, but to go to the next phase of poverty.
[01:11:08.399 --> 01:11:25.164]  And so it was announced Friday, when everybody's paychecks got deposited, they waited until payday, that your bank account's frozen, you can only get 50 euros out of an ATM, that all ran out in hours, and now they have a bank holiday until Thursday, and no one can get their money out, and it's sending shockwaves all over.
[01:11:25.184 --> 01:11:33.367]  People say, how dumb of the EU central bank, headed up by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan operatives on record, how crazy they did this!
[01:11:33.427 --> 01:11:34.707]  It's killing confidence!
[01:11:35.107 --> 01:11:36.548]  It's killing the bond market!
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:40.402]  Why it's killing the euro.
[01:11:41.103 --> 01:11:43.644]  That's the plan, is to panic everybody.
[01:11:44.965 --> 01:11:46.627]  There's an article, just don't call it a bailout.
[01:11:46.687 --> 01:11:51.610]  European governments devise unusual measures to prop up their ailing banks.
[01:11:52.271 --> 01:11:53.912]  There's a new article on that front.
[01:11:56.286 --> 01:11:56.666]  There it is.
[01:11:56.786 --> 01:11:57.686]  Pension funds.
[01:11:57.826 --> 01:12:03.828]  In Italy, for example, the government is encouraging banks to buy public properties that the banks then can use to borrow the money.
[01:12:04.188 --> 01:12:11.910]  As part of the broader deficit reduction program in Portugal, the government essentially is borrowing money from the bank pension funds and could use some of the funds.
[01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:12.890]  Yeah, that's just one example.
[01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:14.471]  There are examples where U.S.
[01:12:14.511 --> 01:12:21.912]  companies are, quote, ordered to invest the lion's share of their people's 401k money in failing
[01:12:26.112 --> 01:12:26.732]  Bank stocks.
[01:12:27.953 --> 01:12:28.313]  Imagine.
[01:12:28.453 --> 01:12:31.554]  I order you to prop up my Bernie Madoff operation.
[01:12:33.135 --> 01:12:35.295]  And so here are some of the headlines that I have on that front.
[01:12:35.335 --> 01:12:38.837]  Banking chief calls for 15% looting of Italian savings.
[01:12:39.017 --> 01:12:43.358]  Is the financial rape of Cyprus another IMF riot waiting to happen?
[01:12:43.979 --> 01:12:44.259]  Yeah.
[01:12:44.459 --> 01:12:46.940]  Key article up at Infowars.com.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.201]  Also up at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:12:49.221 --> 01:12:49.541]  There it is.
[01:12:49.901 --> 01:12:52.402]  Japan using public funds to prop up Nikkei.
[01:12:53.868 --> 01:12:57.351]  Wall Street Journal, putting people's pensions in it.
[01:12:57.472 --> 01:12:59.313]  Again, you can just pull up these articles every day.
[01:13:03.237 --> 01:13:06.861]  After banksters steal money from accounts in Cyprus, they will start doing it everywhere.
[01:13:07.181 --> 01:13:09.043]  Michael Schneider, the Economic Collapse blog.
[01:13:09.303 --> 01:13:10.124]  Yeah, it's already begun.
[01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:15.670]  Cyprus government's great bank robbery of private accounts may shut off bank runs across Europe.
[01:13:17.079 --> 01:13:20.022]  The rape of Cyprus by the European Union and the IMF.
[01:13:20.042 --> 01:13:20.662]  Zero hedge.
[01:13:21.023 --> 01:13:23.004]  Cyprus to put forward new bailout plan.
[01:13:23.285 --> 01:13:29.670]  They say, well, we'll let you know on Thursday what it is, but even if Cyprus won't vote, we're going ahead with it.
[01:13:29.690 --> 01:13:32.813]  But it may just be 3 to 6.75 or 7.5.
[01:13:35.335 --> 01:13:39.759]  We may just take a smaller percentage out of your account.
[01:13:41.481 --> 01:13:42.362]  And that makes it okay.
[01:13:43.698 --> 01:13:44.238]  And why not?
[01:13:44.278 --> 01:13:50.262]  The IRS and the European Union's version of that has been taking people's bank accounts in whole for decades.
[01:13:50.322 --> 01:13:51.863]  No judge, no jury, no proof.
[01:13:52.203 --> 01:13:53.404]  Just, we seized your account.
[01:13:56.226 --> 01:13:57.247]  We seized your account.
[01:13:59.148 --> 01:13:59.628]  Why not?
[01:14:00.929 --> 01:14:01.689]  Why not, folks?
[01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:04.431]  I mean, all over the world, they tell you you can't film in public.
[01:14:05.532 --> 01:14:08.454]  In Europe, in Canada, in the United States.
[01:14:09.747 --> 01:14:12.829]  My crew has all had, on video, cops walk over.
[01:14:13.309 --> 01:14:22.054]  If they're filming in the middle of a city square, on the side of the street, 200 yards from the cops running a checkpoint, they march over and go, TURN THAT CAMERA OFF, I'LL ARREST YOU!
[01:14:22.154 --> 01:14:23.515]  And they have no law behind them.
[01:14:23.555 --> 01:14:27.097]  It's just pure, arbitrary crime.
[01:14:27.638 --> 01:14:28.158]  And you know what?
[01:14:28.238 --> 01:14:30.699]  If you'll act like that, cops, they're going to take everything you've got.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.101]  Due process protects us all.
[01:14:33.581 --> 01:14:36.403]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and similar systems like it,
[01:14:37.369 --> 01:14:40.931]  And there it is, FDIC wants pension funds to prop up failed banks.
[01:14:40.951 --> 01:14:44.713]  See, I throw something out, and the guys just start searching and finding it to back me up.
[01:14:44.934 --> 01:14:46.094]  That's Bloomberg News.
[01:14:46.655 --> 01:14:47.235]  And that's from 2010.
[01:14:47.735 --> 01:14:50.117]  And by the way, they got the money.
[01:14:50.317 --> 01:14:51.017]  In fact, print that.
[01:14:51.037 --> 01:14:57.821]  I think that's the article where it quotes the corporate chief saying, I'm doing it under orders.
[01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:00.414]  Of the Treasury.
[01:15:00.434 --> 01:15:02.435]  And people say, well, how can they order them to do that?
[01:15:02.675 --> 01:15:05.518]  Because if you don't, there's a Justice Department investigation.
[01:15:06.178 --> 01:15:11.423]  And the way they've got SEC rules written, you can't do anything without it being mail fraud.
[01:15:13.365 --> 01:15:15.686]  They can find something to put you in jail.
[01:15:17.168 --> 01:15:18.849]  Martha Stewart did nothing, went to jail.
[01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:23.293]  If you publicly steal trillions, you get to become Treasury Secretary.
[01:15:23.673 --> 01:15:27.857]  If you publicly give yourself $200 million of bailout money, like Paulson, you don't get in trouble.
[01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:33.441]  If you commit hardcore, giant crimes out in front of everyone, you're fine.
[01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:34.782]  If you're a globalist.
[01:15:34.862 --> 01:15:38.745]  But you can't... Look, Justice Department, I told you this two years ago.
[01:15:39.145 --> 01:15:41.987]  I told you they would start investigating and then indict News Corp.
[01:15:42.848 --> 01:15:45.410]  I'm telling you, they may arrest everybody over at News Corp.
[01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:51.594]  And then you'll have people that actually were involved in hacking, clearly, where all his underlings just got arrested.
[01:15:52.235 --> 01:15:53.716]  Piers Morgan, he won't get in any trouble.
[01:15:57.526 --> 01:16:03.888]  Notice they signed the EU deal and said that they were just going to start taking the money out of the bank account, and now they're spending it.
[01:16:04.068 --> 01:16:05.128]  Oh, we're considering it.
[01:16:06.908 --> 01:16:07.808]  That's how they spend this.
[01:16:07.849 --> 01:16:09.309]  Okay, let's go to your calls, as promised.
[01:16:10.329 --> 01:16:21.792]  I just hope everybody realizes the off-the-chart magnitude of what's going on here, because I'm going to explain it to you again.
[01:16:22.796 --> 01:16:28.898]  They want to bankrupt everything and then have only people working for government and megacorporations that are above the law.
[01:16:29.398 --> 01:16:33.960]  And then they're going to replace us all with robots like Foxconn's doing at the Apple Slave Factories.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.620]  Apple Slave Factories!
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:42.762]  But it's like, you know, I talk to so-called liberals who are really weirdo, mentally ill, authoritarians who like to lick their lips and feel powerful.
[01:16:42.782 --> 01:16:44.683]  And I go, what about Al Gore and the slave camps?
[01:16:44.703 --> 01:16:47.324]  They go, shut up, old white man, you're going to fail.
[01:16:47.804 --> 01:16:50.125]  I'm like, you're white, you're supporting
[01:16:51.005 --> 01:16:53.926]  Total slavery in China, and they're just like, shut up, loser.
[01:16:54.266 --> 01:16:54.766]  I'm a winner.
[01:16:55.106 --> 01:16:57.766]  And they could have ten dollars to their name, they act like this.
[01:16:58.286 --> 01:17:14.109]  It's imagining, and it's all this weird socialist race-based thing, they're part of the winning club, mental illness, and the Republicans have come out in the new study and said, we agree, we've gotta, you know, give up on everything, open borders, gay marriage, that'll make everyone love us.
[01:17:14.169 --> 01:17:14.689]  No, it won't.
[01:17:15.389 --> 01:17:16.809]  You're just joining the hoax.
[01:17:17.349 --> 01:17:19.990]  People are leaving you en masse because they know you're globalist.
[01:17:21.783 --> 01:17:22.704]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[01:17:22.864 --> 01:17:25.386]  Aaron in California, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:17:26.988 --> 01:17:27.248]  No, no.
[01:17:27.568 --> 01:17:29.650]  Let me tell you what's happening in Cyprus right now.
[01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:39.419]  They're taking real money, billions, six billion, in real euros, and they're replacing that with another loan.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.680]  Okay, so that's very clear.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.423]  They're still on the hook, so they got principal and interest going.
[01:17:43.923 --> 01:17:45.245]  The solution to that
[01:17:45.985 --> 01:17:53.229]  Is for all of the slaves to begin withdrawing the money all over the world from the banks and holding those notes.
[01:17:53.890 --> 01:17:56.571]  Of course, and diversifying into precious metals.
[01:17:56.831 --> 01:18:02.574]  Well, you're right, but only on average there's less than 2-3% worldwide of actual physical cashola.
[01:18:02.594 --> 01:18:05.056]  You gotta take it out of there.
[01:18:05.076 --> 01:18:07.117]  That's gonna precipitate the decline.
[01:18:07.137 --> 01:18:08.618]  The dominoes will start to fall then.
[01:18:08.898 --> 01:18:09.959]  That's what they admit to.
[01:18:10.279 --> 01:18:12.620]  So let's have that progress.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.881]  Take the money out.
[01:18:14.443 --> 01:18:18.185]  Then they begin to get more and more desperate, and we get to, you know, the endgame.
[01:18:18.205 --> 01:18:19.106]  No, no, I agree.
[01:18:19.126 --> 01:18:22.307]  I mean, I've been telling my wife for months, because I'm too busy, we've got to get a little bit of cash out.
[01:18:22.407 --> 01:18:23.508]  I don't have that much.
[01:18:24.008 --> 01:18:29.191]  But the point is, is that it is time to, oh, those old-timers, they're dumb.
[01:18:29.551 --> 01:18:32.573]  They bury it in the root cellar, put it in the wall.
[01:18:33.093 --> 01:18:36.035]  They'd already been through having their money taken and devalued.
[01:18:36.575 --> 01:18:41.958]  I mean, my great-grandfather, who owned one of the, I think it was the first Chevy dealership in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the point is,
[01:18:43.507 --> 01:18:44.789]  He didn't turn his gold in.
[01:18:45.931 --> 01:18:57.627]  And my grandmother, who's still alive, that was my grandfather's dad, but my grandmother remembers her grandfather, who worked for Sun Oil, he didn't turn his gold in in 1933.
[01:19:00.376 --> 01:19:01.917]  And again, they couldn't come arrest everybody.
[01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:04.799]  They arrested a few people, put it in the newspaper to scare everybody.
[01:19:05.079 --> 01:19:11.062]  A lot of people went and turned their gold in for dollars that were then devalued, and then gold was doubled in price a year later.
[01:19:11.743 --> 01:19:16.826]  I mean, look, folks, they will do anything if you follow their orders.
[01:19:16.846 --> 01:19:17.166]  Go ahead.
[01:19:18.592 --> 01:19:21.814]  Yeah, I think you should have an allocation about half in U.S.
[01:19:22.074 --> 01:19:24.395]  Federal Reserve notes and half in precious metals.
[01:19:24.815 --> 01:19:26.036]  Then you play it both ways.
[01:19:26.116 --> 01:19:28.197]  I think that's the safe bet out of the system.
[01:19:28.237 --> 01:19:33.120]  That's the most thing out of their system where they can get their hands on it electronically.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.621]  So I think that's the solution.
[01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:35.101]  No, I agree.
[01:19:35.461 --> 01:19:38.183]  And that's the problem with having a cashless society.
[01:19:39.281 --> 01:19:42.302]  The problem with having a cashless society is an angel isn't running it.
[01:19:42.322 --> 01:19:43.522]  Well, I guess an angel is, the devil.
[01:19:44.102 --> 01:19:45.242]  You know, good guys aren't running it.
[01:19:45.262 --> 01:19:49.923]  These are globalists that are social engineers who, again, one example of how they make money.
[01:19:50.343 --> 01:19:58.984]  General Electric gets a waiver to not shut down their coal power plants and has Obama shut down 200 plus a year, doubling and tripling the profits of General Electric.
[01:19:59.184 --> 01:20:01.085]  That's how they make money, shutting you down.
[01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:08.286]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:15.124]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:37.253]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:20:37.993 --> 01:20:48.423]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:21:05.495 --> 01:21:09.316]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[01:21:10.356 --> 01:21:12.077]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[01:21:12.437 --> 01:21:13.697]  Police call it robbery.
[01:21:14.317 --> 01:21:15.697]  We call it avoidable.
[01:21:16.218 --> 01:21:21.819]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[01:21:22.239 --> 01:21:27.140]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:33.542]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[01:21:34.662 --> 01:21:39.465]  At only $34.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans.
[01:21:39.865 --> 01:21:42.067]  And it's perfect if you're traveling or away from home.

[01:22:30.376 --> 01:22:39.642]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:39.702 --> 01:22:40.443]  This capitalism?
[01:22:40.503 --> 01:22:46.647]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:46.767 --> 01:22:47.547]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:47.588 --> 01:22:50.670]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:51.630]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:53.011]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:53.351]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.391 --> 01:22:53.652]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.696 --> 01:23:04.797]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:05.457 --> 01:23:07.598]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:08.498 --> 01:23:16.840]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:17.461 --> 01:23:22.362]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:23.001 --> 01:23:33.974]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:23:34.374 --> 01:23:41.383]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:42.063 --> 01:23:46.324]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:23:46.364 --> 01:23:49.545]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:23:49.965 --> 01:23:56.907]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:23:57.207 --> 01:23:58.227]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:58.487 --> 01:23:59.528]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:11.863 --> 01:24:14.966]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are firebombings going on.
[01:24:15.286 --> 01:24:17.348]  This is breaking right now in Cyprus.
[01:24:18.389 --> 01:24:20.771]  They've got live feeds of it on Fox News.
[01:24:22.912 --> 01:24:25.735]  That is unfolding, and that's part of the IMF plan.
[01:24:25.755 --> 01:24:27.616]  They know people will then riot.
[01:24:27.696 --> 01:24:29.738]  If they have to, they'll get provocateurs to do it.
[01:24:30.279 --> 01:24:34.983]  And then that will drive down confidence even more, so the globalists can come in and buy it up even faster.
[01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.044]  This is not my opinion.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.022]  It's in the IMF World Bank plans that got leaked in 2002.
[01:24:40.763 --> 01:24:42.945]  It's in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:24:43.005 --> 01:24:44.446]  It was covered by the BBC.
[01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:47.348]  I'm going to get Greg Palast back on about this very, very soon.
[01:24:47.809 --> 01:24:49.710]  And when they're done, they're going to do that here.
[01:24:50.971 --> 01:24:53.794]  And that's what the armored vehicles and the bullets and all of it are about.
[01:24:53.814 --> 01:24:55.635]  And you're like, well, I just won't riot then.
[01:24:56.075 --> 01:24:56.676]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:24:56.696 --> 01:24:58.437]  They're going to blow stuff up and say we did it.
[01:24:59.338 --> 01:25:05.103]  They're already saying white gun owners that believe in a new world order are going to bomb things.
[01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:08.351]  Whites are inherently terrorists.
[01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:09.912]  Christians are inherently terrorists.
[01:25:10.332 --> 01:25:11.453]  And you're like, why are they doing that?
[01:25:11.493 --> 01:25:16.256]  Well, here's a new poll out, a new big study.
[01:25:16.736 --> 01:25:19.017]  Are you an older white Republican man?
[01:25:19.037 --> 01:25:21.879]  Study finds you are most likely to ditch news outlet.
[01:25:23.584 --> 01:25:29.787]  And it goes over the fact that they've done a new Pew Research, States of the Media report.
[01:25:30.108 --> 01:25:31.809]  And I've got that report right here.
[01:25:32.309 --> 01:25:33.710]  The State of the News Media 2013.
[01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:41.134]  It shows mainstream media is dying overall, but that white men particularly just don't even trust it or believe it.
[01:25:41.394 --> 01:25:43.535]  Well, no kidding, because they've been chosen to be the bad guys.
[01:25:43.955 --> 01:25:46.216]  They get on CNN, MSNBC every day.
[01:25:46.236 --> 01:25:49.938]  And I've been covering this a lot lately because it's crazy.
[01:25:50.019 --> 01:25:50.699]  It's working.
[01:25:51.892 --> 01:25:53.895]  And they just say, don't like turning your guns in?
[01:25:53.975 --> 01:25:54.436]  Racist.
[01:25:54.756 --> 01:25:55.737]  Don't like socialism?
[01:25:55.798 --> 01:25:56.218]  Racist.
[01:25:56.639 --> 01:25:57.480]  Don't like open borders?
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.001]  Racist.
[01:25:58.481 --> 01:25:59.903]  Don't like banks taking your money?
[01:25:59.963 --> 01:26:00.284]  Racist.
[01:26:00.304 --> 01:26:01.466]  Don't want your pension funds rated?
[01:26:01.506 --> 01:26:01.786]  Racist.
[01:26:02.066 --> 01:26:05.812]  And they've connected race-based politics with women.
[01:26:07.406 --> 01:26:09.627]  And they've got white women going, that's right, white men are evil.
[01:26:09.707 --> 01:26:10.827]  I mean, literally, on the news.
[01:26:10.927 --> 01:26:12.247]  And it's okay to do that.
[01:26:12.887 --> 01:26:19.129]  Imagine if they had the women and everybody else saying black people were bad or something, or Hispanics.
[01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:21.109]  But again, you're like, it doesn't make sense.
[01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.810]  Yes, it does.
[01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:23.990]  Because it's about, you're the winning team.
[01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:25.410]  Your team won the Super Bowl.
[01:26:25.690 --> 01:26:30.452]  Team women, team minority, which is the majority, defeated white guys!
[01:26:30.772 --> 01:26:31.552]  Yay!
[01:26:31.612 --> 01:26:33.032]  Healthcare's doubling in price!
[01:26:33.112 --> 01:26:34.593]  And you're like, why am I happy?
[01:26:34.633 --> 01:26:35.593]  Doesn't matter, feels good.
[01:26:37.549 --> 01:26:41.590]  And it's this bandwagon, collectivist, weirdo stuff.
[01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:49.932]  And then they're going to blow stuff up and say the evil white males did it and the whole Homeland Security is for the veterans and the white men.
[01:26:52.193 --> 01:26:53.513]  And then they have the Republicans.
[01:26:53.533 --> 01:26:54.734]  Look at this ridiculous headline.
[01:26:54.754 --> 01:26:55.554]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:26:55.574 --> 01:26:59.355]  I think you guys can punch this up on screen.
[01:26:59.615 --> 01:27:02.536]  Bowties and Mohawks at the CPAC 2013 show.
[01:27:07.725 --> 01:27:09.446]  No, I've got it on my computer screen right there.
[01:27:11.606 --> 01:27:12.887]  It's International Business Times.
[01:27:13.647 --> 01:27:17.228]  Bowties and Mohawks at the CPAC 2013 show.
[01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:19.669]  Changing Republican Party.
[01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:21.570]  See, that's what change is all about.
[01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:22.910]  What color you are.
[01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:24.551]  What color your Mohawk is.
[01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:28.292]  Not about the content of your heart, your mind, what you stand for.
[01:27:31.041 --> 01:27:33.143]  It's about, ooh, a mohawk.
[01:27:33.684 --> 01:27:41.713]  So now the Republicans are parading people around with pink mohawks to go, hey kids, we're trendy, we're with the times.
[01:27:42.834 --> 01:27:43.695]  Yeah, we agree.
[01:27:43.715 --> 01:27:47.279]  We want totally open borders and world government and socialism.
[01:27:47.779 --> 01:27:48.400]  And you know what?
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:51.402]  Let's teach five-year-olds how to have gay sex.
[01:27:51.482 --> 01:27:53.124]  Yes, yes, we're trendy.
[01:27:53.484 --> 01:27:55.966]  Well, I just asked Senator Lindsey Graham.
[01:27:56.006 --> 01:27:58.268]  He knows all about it, about how to be trendy.
[01:27:58.588 --> 01:28:03.352]  Bow ties and mohawks at CPAC 2013 show changing Republican Party.
[01:28:03.592 --> 01:28:05.694]  Yeah, don't talk about how megabanks are robbing us.
[01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:08.536]  Don't talk about crony capitalism and the elite taking over.
[01:28:08.757 --> 01:28:11.359]  Don't talk about the loss of basic freedom for everybody.
[01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:14.802]  Don't talk about Martin Luther King saying colorblind society.
[01:28:15.102 --> 01:28:15.662]  No, no, no!
[01:28:16.423 --> 01:28:20.728]  No, we have cool people, bow ties, and mohawks.
[01:28:21.008 --> 01:28:22.290]  Oh my God.
[01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:23.972]  Kids, don't you want to vote Republican now?
[01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:36.386]  And then this is the whole mind control job by the globalists that own the Republicans as well, that want this whole agenda push through to make everything not about liberty and freedom and private property, but about your group.
[01:28:38.658 --> 01:28:41.020]  Group rights, not individual rights, group rights.
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.800]  And then who represents the group rights?
[01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:46.442]  The group leaders that are globalist controlled and the state that referees it all.
[01:28:46.702 --> 01:28:57.208]  And so that's how they're fully converting over into this new system where we're all basically divided into our own groups.
[01:28:58.268 --> 01:28:59.329]  And they have the new poll out.
[01:28:59.449 --> 01:29:05.732]  GOP study calls for changes to halt presidential losing streak.
[01:29:07.438 --> 01:29:08.138]  And the answer?
[01:29:08.238 --> 01:29:10.039]  Basically become the Democratic Party.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.121]  You know, get with the times.
[01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:15.382]  I mean, abortion is so cool.
[01:29:18.023 --> 01:29:20.584]  Doesn't matter that polls show in young people over 70% are anti-abortion.
[01:29:22.483 --> 01:29:23.964]  Women were more and more anti-abortion.
[01:29:24.224 --> 01:29:25.565]  But I've seen the big studies.
[01:29:25.585 --> 01:29:29.528]  It's actually working by saying, hey women, you showed the white men you get to kill your babies.
[01:29:30.428 --> 01:29:35.452]  A lot of women are like suddenly flipping back to the Democrats because it's the bandwagon effect of, ooh, I want to be a winner.
[01:29:35.472 --> 01:29:41.916]  I want to drive around all satisfied in my car, you know, because I'm hooked on to Obama and he's pimping me out to the New World Order.
[01:29:42.317 --> 01:29:46.539]  I mean, this is, you know, the vice president's pimping me out.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.001]  It's just all so patronizing.
[01:29:49.041 --> 01:29:49.842]  Your call's coming up.
[01:29:50.868 --> 01:29:53.852]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.793 --> 01:29:57.456]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:01.963 --> 01:31:05.006]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:31:05.366 --> 01:31:10.831]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:09.905]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:11.477 --> 01:33:15.440]  All right, we've got loaded phone lines here, but when you hear somebody hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:15.520]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:15.580]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.021]  Russian warships are being sent.
[01:33:17.041 --> 01:33:18.542]  A fleet is being sent, according to Sky News.
[01:33:18.562 --> 01:33:20.243]  That's Fox Europe.
[01:33:32.415 --> 01:33:35.937]  Cyprus bailout, savings shift amid Russian offer.
[01:33:35.957 --> 01:33:37.978]  We're going to be getting into all that.
[01:33:38.018 --> 01:33:56.989]  And really the biggest news overall is that the Fed's Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, which is about the fourth most powerful branch out of 12, says, two big to fail banks are crony capitalists and are consolidating the economy under them and will destroy our future.
[01:33:58.135 --> 01:34:01.096]  And he's been criticizing him more and more the last three years.
[01:34:01.456 --> 01:34:03.297]  I actually know someone who knows him.
[01:34:04.658 --> 01:34:05.538]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:11.941]  In fact, I shouldn't even say that.
[01:34:13.052 --> 01:34:16.654]  I've just learned with sources, it's just best to not even get into any of it.
[01:34:16.694 --> 01:34:31.604]  The point is, is that the Federal Reserve in Dallas, the Federal Reserve in Kansas City, both their heads, which are representing shareholders of the inner cabal, are realizing that this is a really nasty plan.
[01:34:33.085 --> 01:34:34.826]  I wouldn't even say they're good guys overall.
[01:34:35.386 --> 01:34:37.568]  They just realized that this is bad for business.
[01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:40.654]  And that the globalists are going to implode everything.
[01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:42.436]  So I'm going to be getting to that report as well.
[01:34:43.117 --> 01:34:50.024]  Don't forget there's been massive attempts to censor Infowars.com over the years to shut us down, to block us, to demonize us.
[01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:59.974]  We're being listed as terror leaders by the Southern Poverty Law Center for simply being able to add 2 plus 2 equals 4 and just being basic Americans who stand for liberty.
[01:35:00.655 --> 01:35:08.003]  And sovereignty of this nation, and who don't want the UN running our military, and who don't want to give $85 billion a month to foreign banks.
[01:35:08.363 --> 01:35:10.866]  Do you think those foreign banks like it that I'm there exposing that?
[01:35:12.508 --> 01:35:12.688]  No.
[01:35:12.768 --> 01:35:14.350]  I mean, we're doing something dangerous here.
[01:35:15.481 --> 01:35:21.743]  So to support our local AM and FM affiliates, spread the word about them, spread the word about their sponsors, become local sponsors.
[01:35:22.343 --> 01:35:24.544]  It's a big deal when we're on local stations.
[01:35:25.364 --> 01:35:27.164]  It's a big deal the broadcast is growing.
[01:35:27.564 --> 01:35:28.665]  Yes, it should be growing.
[01:35:28.705 --> 01:35:31.605]  Yes, we're just talking about things that are happening.
[01:35:32.206 --> 01:35:34.606]  But that's a crime when criminals run things.
[01:35:35.266 --> 01:35:42.288]  In a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act, to quote Eric Blair, a.k.a.
[01:35:42.348 --> 01:35:43.229]  George Orwell of 1984 fame.
[01:35:45.478 --> 01:35:51.705]  And so don't take it for granted, folks, that we're on your local AM and FM affiliates today, because those stations could be bought out tomorrow.
[01:35:52.145 --> 01:35:55.389]  Don't take it for granted that PrisonPlanet.tv is up and running today.
[01:35:56.290 --> 01:35:58.933]  Support us so we can be strong going into the future.
[01:35:59.373 --> 01:36:02.897]  Buy the ProPure water filtration systems, discounted with promo code WATER.
[01:36:04.058 --> 01:36:10.200]  Buy the great little stove systems that we've got that are great for preparedness and also for camping and travel.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:16.481]  Buy the books, the videos, the women's apparel, the Pro Second Amendment t-shirts.
[01:36:17.802 --> 01:36:20.242]  All of your purchases make the broadcast possible.
[01:36:20.302 --> 01:36:25.083]  InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:25.103 --> 01:36:28.844]  And support our sponsors like Midas Resources.
[01:36:29.904 --> 01:36:31.565]  Give them a call, ask them about
[01:36:32.639 --> 01:36:34.761]  They're best deals on bullion, gold, and silver.
[01:36:35.042 --> 01:36:35.703]  That's what I'd buy.
[01:36:36.123 --> 01:36:42.070]  But if you're going to get numismatic collectibles, they will actually sell you numismatics for close to what they are really worth.
[01:36:42.090 --> 01:36:43.492]  They've got to put a tiny markup in there.
[01:36:43.712 --> 01:36:45.534]  There's a lot of baiting and switching in the industry.
[01:36:45.794 --> 01:36:48.417]  Some of the biggest names have horrible, you know, F ratings.
[01:36:49.178 --> 01:36:52.182]  Midas has an A+, highest level, better business bureau.
[01:36:53.956 --> 01:36:56.839]  Because they'll sell you numismatics with tiny markups.
[01:36:56.999 --> 01:36:57.880]  It's all available.
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:59.401]  Midas Resources, 800-686-2237.
[01:36:59.501 --> 01:37:03.545]  And without Midas, we couldn't have done any of this.
[01:37:03.985 --> 01:37:13.914]  So not only are they great folks I've worked with for 16 years, I went out and shopped for the best name, bought some gold, silver from a bunch of places myself, found out they had the best deals, didn't try to bait and switch me.
[01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:19.800]  If Ted catches brokers, this happens every once in a while, trying to, you know, overcharge somebody or bait and switch, they're fired.
[01:37:21.104 --> 01:37:22.164]  I'll be quite honest with you.
[01:37:22.184 --> 01:37:27.487]  About a month or two ago, one of my friends bought some gold and had maybe a little bit too big of a markup for what they thought.
[01:37:27.687 --> 01:37:29.167]  The guy was fired the next day.
[01:37:29.547 --> 01:37:38.011]  My point is, is that in a business out there that runs from excellent to horrible, Midas is as good as it gets, and they support the broadcast.
[01:37:38.031 --> 01:37:38.611]  800-686-2237.
[01:37:40.031 --> 01:37:43.253]  They're the place to get precious metals.
[01:37:43.293 --> 01:37:47.154]  And if you haven't moved some of your assets into gold and silver, I think you're nuts.
[01:37:47.714 --> 01:37:48.515]  I think you're crazy.
[01:37:49.235 --> 01:37:55.559]  They've been doing everything they can to short, sell it, to naked short it, to try to suppress it.
[01:37:56.516 --> 01:37:58.436]  While the globalists buy it with both hands.
[01:37:58.496 --> 01:38:02.777]  Soros, the Chinese government, University of Texas, all these other big universities.
[01:38:03.157 --> 01:38:05.498]  Insiders are just grabbing it greedily.
[01:38:05.978 --> 01:38:11.819]  And tungsten gold in the Federal Reserve, I heard that seven years ago now confirmed, won't give Germany their gold.
[01:38:11.859 --> 01:38:12.940]  They've asked for their gold.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:13.360]  The U.S.
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:15.140]  has said ten years to get it back.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.100]  We'll give it to you in increments.
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.921]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:38:17.941 --> 01:38:24.102]  We're sitting on a mountain of TNT, and everybody's, you know, playing with sparklers and smoking cigarettes.
[01:38:25.185 --> 01:38:28.387]  And dancing around with, you know, giant gasoline-fed torches.
[01:38:28.427 --> 01:38:30.848]  I mean, it's a matter of time until this blows sky-high.
[01:38:33.170 --> 01:38:34.530]  And people say, well, that's fear-mongering.
[01:38:34.671 --> 01:38:38.073]  I bought gold and silver because I was afraid of what you're starting to see happen.
[01:38:38.093 --> 01:38:39.633]  Because I could see the writing on the wall.
[01:38:40.334 --> 01:38:44.636]  Being concerned about something and getting prepared for it is not fear-mongering.
[01:38:45.017 --> 01:38:47.178]  It's called getting up on your hind legs and fighting.
[01:38:48.817 --> 01:38:55.041]  Let me tell you, you know, I've been mugged a couple times growing up in Dallas, because I'd go in the bad neighborhoods to buy beer and stuff.
[01:38:55.061 --> 01:38:58.883]  You know, my high school buddies, we'd drive into Dallas, the worst part of Dallas, South Dallas, to buy beer.
[01:39:00.284 --> 01:39:05.587]  And routinely, we'd go buy it from the bootleggers, sometimes when the liquor store wouldn't sell it to us.
[01:39:06.648 --> 01:39:09.610]  And I was dumb enough, they'd say, OK, Alex, you go up and you get the beer.
[01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:16.154]  Because I was, you know, you've got the fake tough guys and the crazy brave, as they say.
[01:39:17.128 --> 01:39:21.393]  You know, it's a fair response when somebody walks around with a club or a knife and says, give me everything you got.
[01:39:21.774 --> 01:39:23.055]  And it's not that I'm even a tough guy.
[01:39:23.075 --> 01:39:25.358]  If somebody's menacing me, I automatically attack them.
[01:39:25.698 --> 01:39:28.302]  And then my heart rate goes up, adrenaline goes up, and I attack.
[01:39:28.722 --> 01:39:30.124]  It's not that I even have courage.
[01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:31.045]  It's that I attack.
[01:39:31.586 --> 01:39:33.007]  And that's normal, folks.
[01:39:33.047 --> 01:39:34.830]  That's a normal response.
[01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:49.377]  And see, I attack, saying I attack the New World Order, I attack the globalists, I attack the banker heads, I attack their system, offensively discrediting them, because that's what they, you know, need to have is your support to continue.
[01:39:49.738 --> 01:39:55.661]  We've got to discredit them so they collapse like the Soviet Union, while I have a defense of getting ready and prepared.
[01:39:56.348 --> 01:39:59.349]  And if you don't get ready and prepared, you're out of your stinking mind.
[01:39:59.949 --> 01:40:01.129]  We told you they'd come for the guns.
[01:40:01.169 --> 01:40:01.710]  That's happening.
[01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:03.110]  This is all no-brainers, folks.
[01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:05.050]  These are criminals, okay?
[01:40:05.411 --> 01:40:06.791]  These are criminals, and it's that simple.
[01:40:06.851 --> 01:40:07.751]  Midas Resources, 800-686-2237.
[01:40:07.771 --> 01:40:07.851]  800-686-237.
[01:40:08.051 --> 01:40:10.332]  And if you want their very best deal, two silver dollars at cost, $72.
[01:40:10.372 --> 01:40:11.092]  Shipping included, $72.
[01:40:11.452 --> 01:40:12.313]  That makes them $62.
[01:40:12.353 --> 01:40:13.173]  That's about $10 a ship.
[01:40:21.095 --> 01:40:23.396]  So the real prize is $62 for two silver coins.
[01:40:23.416 --> 01:40:24.096]  $10 is added.
[01:40:24.136 --> 01:40:24.836]  That's at cost.
[01:40:25.056 --> 01:40:27.797]  And then two free films, powerful films, and a book.
[01:40:28.237 --> 01:40:32.978]  The Obama Deception, American Dream, all of it, along with dishonest money.
[01:40:32.998 --> 01:40:36.419]  And if you want, when you call, they'll give you a free booklet, 10 Reasons to Own Gold.
[01:40:36.439 --> 01:40:38.299]  $72, 800-686-237.
[01:40:38.399 --> 01:40:41.940]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:44.200]  Leonard in Montana, thanks for holding.
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.881]  Then Michael and others, you're on the air.
[01:40:45.901 --> 01:40:46.181]  Go ahead.
[01:40:47.202 --> 01:40:53.865]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to call you to tell you thank you for having, you know, the courage to do this for so long.
[01:40:53.885 --> 01:40:57.206]  We know that you're gonna, you know, fall on the fence and all that.
[01:40:57.866 --> 01:41:03.188]  So anyway, um, I just wanted to tell you, tell people to buy ammo, ammo, ammo.
[01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:07.610]  And also, if you could, make a shirt that says, No King but King Jesus.
[01:41:07.710 --> 01:41:11.172]  It's the most popular thing that I got people saying around here.
[01:41:11.292 --> 01:41:12.012]  Everyone says it now.
[01:41:13.735 --> 01:41:14.495]  That's a good idea.
[01:41:14.515 --> 01:41:30.523]  Well, that's what our forefounders, forebears, pointed out, was that we're not going to worship and say you're above the law, because if you read the writings of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and if you check, you're like, oh my gosh, this is exactly what we have.
[01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:42.108]  They would use regulators to shut down tobacco farmers, or cotton farmers, or corn farmers, or hemp farmers, and then only the local lord, or the son of the lord from England, was allowed to even operate.
[01:41:43.223 --> 01:41:44.304]  It's the same deal.
[01:41:44.985 --> 01:41:47.469]  And now they've gotten smart though.
[01:41:47.489 --> 01:41:49.251]  Back then they wouldn't put people on welfare.
[01:41:49.372 --> 01:41:52.656]  Only the rich were on welfare, corporate government welfare.
[01:41:53.925 --> 01:41:54.886]  They got smart though.
[01:41:55.386 --> 01:42:01.209]  The robber barons learned to create big government and get little guys on the payroll and you can buy them cheap.
[01:42:01.509 --> 01:42:06.552]  Doesn't matter if it actually shuts down their future, shuts down the overall prosperity, makes the country horrible.
[01:42:06.912 --> 01:42:09.734]  They won't recognize it if it takes 5-10 years to do it.
[01:42:10.294 --> 01:42:16.377]  And so again I say to people out there, I know countless people on welfare, on disability, and I mean what are they going to do?
[01:42:17.158 --> 01:42:21.540]  I mean the government gives troops deadly vaccines to disable them.
[01:42:24.062 --> 01:42:26.184]  And then they take their gun rights because they're disabled.
[01:42:26.244 --> 01:42:27.685]  I mean, it's a master plan.
[01:42:29.566 --> 01:42:32.169]  How do you counter something so masterful, Leonard?
[01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:38.474]  Well, listen, this isn't about, and everyone needs to understand this, this is not about getting wealthy.
[01:42:38.514 --> 01:42:41.996]  This is about surviving to the other side so that we can rebuild this.
[01:42:42.036 --> 01:42:44.959]  Because this system, this moral corruptness,
[01:42:45.606 --> 01:42:48.668]  This absolutely lazy society, it's over.
[01:42:48.808 --> 01:42:49.328]  It's done.
[01:42:49.748 --> 01:42:50.609]  It will not work.
[01:42:50.649 --> 01:42:53.010]  We're walking on the backs of people that no longer exist.
[01:42:53.671 --> 01:42:56.772]  So we're going to have to steer this when it's all done.
[01:42:56.812 --> 01:42:57.653]  You're right, you're right.
[01:42:57.693 --> 01:43:04.677]  And the power structure knows it's going to implode, so they want armored redoubts and high security tyranny to protect them while they suck everything out of us.
[01:43:04.697 --> 01:43:09.579]  And they will keep, they'll take 10% out of your pension fund, then they'll take 10% out of your bank account, and the next year they'll take 10, 10, 10.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.141]  So you'll never rebel, or they'll say,
[01:43:12.381 --> 01:43:12.901]  We're going to take 15.
[01:43:13.422 --> 01:43:14.143]  Well, now it's only 10.
[01:43:14.683 --> 01:43:15.224]  We're going to take 12.
[01:43:15.344 --> 01:43:16.304]  Well, now it's only 10.
[01:43:16.365 --> 01:43:17.506]  Well, we're going to take 10.
[01:43:17.886 --> 01:43:18.386]  Now it's only 7.
[01:43:18.687 --> 01:43:20.728]  I mean, I told people yesterday.
[01:43:20.828 --> 01:43:24.292]  I said, now they'll come out and say, oh, we're only going to take 7.
[01:43:24.452 --> 01:43:25.473]  I even called it.
[01:43:25.893 --> 01:43:27.094]  And I'm not smart!
[01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.716]  It's like I'm the New England Patriots.
[01:43:29.856 --> 01:43:32.799]  I videotaped their practice games.
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:39.165]  I mean, I know exactly what they're going to do because they follow an exact plan.
[01:43:40.612 --> 01:43:46.196]  You know, they change it up here and there, but it's still... And folks, that's so frustrating to know this.
[01:43:46.556 --> 01:43:48.017]  They're going to take everything.
[01:43:48.697 --> 01:43:49.198]  Everything.
[01:43:49.918 --> 01:43:56.902]  And they know that people getting prepared, growing gardens, talking to their neighbors, are the people that are going to try to save society.
[01:43:56.922 --> 01:43:59.104]  They don't want that, so they call us terrorists.
[01:43:59.124 --> 01:44:00.525]  I mean, I'm going to say that again with a straight face.
[01:44:02.042 --> 01:44:02.823]  Folks, look this up.
[01:44:02.883 --> 01:44:03.743]  You know about it in the news.
[01:44:03.803 --> 01:44:15.953]  They're saying people that are trying to get prepared are terrorists and preppers are terrorists when you'd be insane with half of Europe rioting and the same system happening here to get prepared.
[01:44:16.273 --> 01:44:19.156]  But again, that's because they don't want us prepared.
[01:44:19.696 --> 01:44:24.039]  They want a total collapse, reorganization, red terror.
[01:44:24.179 --> 01:44:25.000]  Not communist.
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:28.182]  The globalists use red terror to take over.
[01:44:28.602 --> 01:44:38.029]  And let me tell you, the average schlub who loves socialism, not the poor person on welfare because it's all they can do and they got type 2 diabetes because nobody told them Diet Coke would kill their pancreas.
[01:44:38.669 --> 01:44:45.733]  But the people that are into the liberal socialist ideology are horrible authoritarians with crazed looks in their eyes.
[01:44:46.033 --> 01:44:46.953]  They love it.
[01:44:47.133 --> 01:44:48.374]  They know it's coming.
[01:44:48.654 --> 01:44:50.435]  They want to come in our houses.
[01:44:50.695 --> 01:44:52.256]  They want to force labor our butts.
[01:44:52.476 --> 01:44:54.757]  They're going to make all our kids serve in FEMA Corps.
[01:44:55.037 --> 01:44:55.978]  That's now official.
[01:44:56.258 --> 01:44:58.479]  We are going into slavery.
[01:44:59.019 --> 01:45:01.641]  And every one of these despicable liberals are not liberals.
[01:45:01.902 --> 01:45:10.889]  They are our mortal, dirtbag, commissar enemies, just like Che Guevara, just like Joseph Stalin, just like Mao Zedong.
[01:45:11.110 --> 01:45:18.576]  They are brown-shirt, thug enemies, and you better start hating them, because that's a natural response.
[01:45:18.796 --> 01:45:19.957]  They're not dumb liberals.
[01:45:20.117 --> 01:45:23.500]  They're hardcore takeover artists that took us over!
[01:45:24.241 --> 01:45:24.601]  Okay?
[01:45:24.761 --> 01:45:25.442]  God bless you, sir.
[01:45:25.482 --> 01:45:26.543]  I appreciate your call, Leonard.
[01:45:28.135 --> 01:45:28.215]  Alex?
[01:45:28.335 --> 01:45:28.536]  Yes, sir?
[01:45:52.301 --> 01:45:52.961]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:45:53.001 --> 01:45:53.922]  Hey, my name's Mike.
[01:45:54.662 --> 01:45:57.384]  I'm a Persian Gulf Iraqi veteran.
[01:45:57.664 --> 01:45:59.225]  I suffer really bad PTSD.
[01:45:59.966 --> 01:46:03.468]  And my second suicide attempt, I ended up in the Waco Clinic.
[01:46:04.428 --> 01:46:05.089]  Let me stop you.
[01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:07.330]  Did they put you on psychotropic drugs?
[01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:09.031]  I refuse them.
[01:46:09.091 --> 01:46:09.931]  I don't take that crap.
[01:46:11.372 --> 01:46:15.835]  But my concern is I'm calling more of my fellow veterans out there is because
[01:46:16.644 --> 01:46:23.886]  I was out about three days and they normally have somebody that calls you and checks up on you to see how you are and how you're doing.
[01:46:24.306 --> 01:46:32.129]  And they called me, you know, but it wasn't a regular, you know, it wasn't regular staff at the VA like they normally do call because I'm used to the one in the Detroit facility.
[01:46:32.972 --> 01:46:37.095]  This one, this phone call I got, first he asked me if I was okay.
[01:46:37.115 --> 01:46:38.396]  I was like, yeah, yeah, I'm cool.
[01:46:38.496 --> 01:46:42.859]  And then he introduced himself as a federal auditor for the VA.
[01:46:43.539 --> 01:46:52.425]  And the main premise, after I told him I was doing fine, his focus was, and his main premise to this phone call was for one thing, he asked me if I had firearms.
[01:46:53.045 --> 01:46:55.248]  Or if I didn't, do I have access to firearms?
[01:47:09.602 --> 01:47:10.343]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:47:10.363 --> 01:47:15.986]  They're making felonies now, releasing a balloon accidentally or on purpose for your girlfriend.
[01:47:16.527 --> 01:47:18.688]  So, we need to get rid of the 68 Gun Control Act.
[01:47:19.068 --> 01:47:21.950]  You shouldn't take guns away from anybody.
[01:47:22.150 --> 01:47:23.511]  If somebody's going to get a gun, they're going to get it.
[01:47:23.531 --> 01:47:24.952]  If you're going to commit suicide, you're going to do it.
[01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:27.374]  But I'm going to tell you right now, you're not going to commit suicide.
[01:47:27.734 --> 01:47:29.375]  You're going to live to fight tyranny.
[01:47:29.736 --> 01:47:31.457]  And you're still in a war, soldier.
[01:47:31.817 --> 01:47:33.378]  And you're fighting the New World Order.
[01:47:33.618 --> 01:47:35.780]  And Jesus Christ is going to heal you.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:43.962]  And they put all sorts of vaccines in you to do this to you, and I want you to detox, and I want you to know you're going to beat them by living a long life.
[01:47:43.982 --> 01:47:46.342]  You're going to beat them by not listening to their bull.
[01:47:46.883 --> 01:47:47.243]  Alright?
[01:47:50.804 --> 01:47:51.864]  Where do you stand on this?
[01:47:51.884 --> 01:47:53.344]  Because I don't want them to win.
[01:47:53.364 --> 01:47:59.146]  I don't want them to put out the spirit of giving up and to convince you to commit suicide.
[01:47:59.186 --> 01:48:00.286]  Why have you been suicidal?
[01:48:01.266 --> 01:48:10.276]  Uh, just my, my PTSD and everything is really bad, and when I get drunk it compounds it, and I'm, I, I, I did a lot of bad things over there, and I saw a lot of things happen to my buddies, you know, it just gets me down.
[01:48:10.296 --> 01:48:11.037]  Well, you know what?
[01:48:11.077 --> 01:48:14.781]  You gotta ask God, listen, let's get to the base of it.
[01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:15.963]  You feel guilty, don't you?
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:20.804]  Um, I felt more so when I was over there after a while.
[01:48:20.864 --> 01:48:22.606]  Hey, I'm kicking these people's butt.
[01:48:22.826 --> 01:48:23.327]  Exactly.
[01:48:23.727 --> 01:48:24.689]  You were taking their guns.
[01:48:24.809 --> 01:48:27.572]  Yeah, you were taking their guns, training for America, which is now admitted.
[01:48:27.592 --> 01:48:28.033]  Let me say this.
[01:48:28.534 --> 01:48:30.836]  You didn't consciously know that when you signed up.
[01:48:31.257 --> 01:48:31.637]  You didn't.
[01:48:31.698 --> 01:48:33.480]  You believed you were defending America, didn't you?
[01:48:34.448 --> 01:48:37.490]  Well, I went over there for my folks and my brother and my friends.
[01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:38.090]  Yeah, I did.
[01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:39.591]  Okay, so let me just say this.
[01:48:40.111 --> 01:48:45.394]  Then, even though you were deceived, you did not consciously engage in the evil, and now you repent.
[01:48:45.834 --> 01:48:57.600]  And I'm telling you, if you just hit your knees every day and ask God to change your heart so that you're not destructive towards yourself, because it's normal, when you've done evil, to hate yourself.
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:02.063]  But you can be a changed man, and God can use you to spread the word of liberty.
[01:49:02.523 --> 01:49:05.488]  And it won't happen overnight, but you can slowly get off alcohol.
[01:49:05.949 --> 01:49:08.394]  You can slowly... I'm telling you, God can do it.
[01:49:09.095 --> 01:49:11.419]  So, I mean, have you hit your knees and asked God to forgive you?
[01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:16.172]  I'm not a religious person.
[01:49:16.192 --> 01:49:16.952]  Let me tell you something.
[01:49:17.313 --> 01:49:20.055]  Even if you don't believe in it, studies have shown prayer helps.
[01:49:20.375 --> 01:49:24.258]  Because it accesses an area, the pineal gland, a lot of other things.
[01:49:24.278 --> 01:49:28.901]  When you make that spiritual connection, it releases key endorphins because it's real.
[01:49:29.261 --> 01:49:31.763]  But the point is, is that there's your problem.
[01:49:31.783 --> 01:49:32.724]  And I'm not judging you.
[01:49:33.164 --> 01:49:35.226]  But wouldn't you do anything to get free of this?
[01:49:36.639 --> 01:49:38.761]  Um, I think I'm doing pretty fine right now, man.
[01:49:38.781 --> 01:49:39.321]  Well, that's good.
[01:49:39.381 --> 01:49:39.782]  That's good.
[01:49:39.822 --> 01:49:40.462]  That's good news.
[01:49:40.802 --> 01:49:41.283]  That's good news.
[01:49:41.323 --> 01:49:42.624]  I'm not pushing religion on you.
[01:49:42.984 --> 01:49:46.947]  I'm just saying you've got to forgive yourself and know that you were deceived.
[01:49:47.548 --> 01:49:47.848]  Okay?
[01:49:47.888 --> 01:49:52.952]  And then that can, because you can consciously forgive yourself, but you need to really forgive yourself.
[01:49:52.972 --> 01:49:53.713]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:49:54.676 --> 01:49:55.936]  Yeah, I forgive him.
[01:49:56.016 --> 01:49:58.337]  I don't mean, I'm still a defender of this country.
[01:49:58.477 --> 01:49:59.377]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:59.397 --> 01:50:01.958]  We got, you know, me and my buddies are putting a cell together.
[01:50:02.018 --> 01:50:02.478]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:02.518 --> 01:50:04.978]  We are, you know, we're going to fight this new rule of order.
[01:50:04.998 --> 01:50:05.458]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:05.858 --> 01:50:07.639]  I don't believe it can be changed internally.
[01:50:08.419 --> 01:50:13.960]  There's only one way to change it, you know, and that's to combat it when it's already here.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:14.720]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.001]  Listen, God bless you, sir.
[01:50:16.061 --> 01:50:16.881]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:18.123 --> 01:50:23.328]  Ladies and gentlemen, long before they staged 9-11, long before they launched all this, they had this plan with the troops.
[01:50:23.828 --> 01:50:26.911]  And they know what's going to end up happening, and it's going to cause a civil war.
[01:50:27.851 --> 01:50:32.035]  And I know a lot of people are gearing up for military operations against the globalists.
[01:50:32.996 --> 01:50:35.678]  And the globalists are going to start it where that's a foregone conclusion.
[01:50:35.698 --> 01:50:45.647]  And I just wish everybody would work real hard right now to spread the word, instead of just getting your firearms ready to kill people that come to take your guns.
[01:50:47.059 --> 01:50:49.823]  Who themselves are just biological robots of the globalists.
[01:50:50.684 --> 01:50:52.086]  Who will be thrown in the ditch as well.
[01:50:52.106 --> 01:50:55.972]  We need to reach out to the police and military right now, before this civil war starts.
[01:50:56.493 --> 01:50:57.073]  God help us.
[01:50:57.574 --> 01:50:58.896]  We'll be right back with more phone calls.
[01:50:58.916 --> 01:50:59.277]  Stay with us.

[01:53:01.549 --> 01:53:09.814]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:53:10.114 --> 01:53:10.594]  As a result,
[01:53:10.814 --> 01:53:13.536]  Millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:53:13.776 --> 01:53:17.940]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[01:54:18.601 --> 01:54:21.283]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:54:24.005 --> 01:54:24.926]  And it's so simple.
[01:54:24.946 --> 01:54:36.696]  You turn on the news and it's all about race and all about division and if you're a libertarian, you're a racist, that's because they're scared of the American people unifying together under the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:54:36.756 --> 01:54:38.838]  The system is desperate to divide and conquer.
[01:54:39.907 --> 01:54:49.074]  And Europe-wide, and I've been telling you this for years, they are going to start just taking money right out of bank accounts on top of all the new VAT and EU taxes.
[01:54:49.094 --> 01:54:52.797]  I mean, on average, taxes are above 70% in the euro.
[01:54:53.518 --> 01:54:54.999]  And again, guess who's exempt from them?
[01:54:55.019 --> 01:54:56.000]  The EU bureaucrats.
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:58.382]  Do you realize what they're getting away with?
[01:54:59.349 --> 01:55:06.377]  He realized the magnitude that EU bureaucrats are exempt from the EU income tax and the EU VAT?
[01:55:06.397 --> 01:55:09.401]  I mean, even saying that I feel like a liar.
[01:55:09.761 --> 01:55:10.862]  It's so over the top.
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:16.764]  In fact, guys, type in EU bureaucrats are exempt from taxes, and it'll show mainstream news.
[01:55:17.225 --> 01:55:18.586]  I mean, I can't believe that.
[01:55:18.666 --> 01:55:19.647]  It's so over the top.
[01:55:20.027 --> 01:55:22.309]  And a lot of people are like, well, let them be exempt.
[01:55:22.509 --> 01:55:29.555]  I mean, that's what real tyranny is, is when they don't just do horrible things, they're exempt from it.
[01:55:30.236 --> 01:55:31.017]  I just got chills.
[01:55:32.338 --> 01:55:33.459]  Because it's all coming true.
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:35.541]  I've been right about everything.
[01:55:35.561 --> 01:55:36.742]  You know how horrible that is?
[01:55:38.083 --> 01:55:40.324]  This is, it's not good to be right about this.
[01:55:40.765 --> 01:55:41.905]  I know why you're in denial.
[01:55:42.085 --> 01:55:42.466]  I get it.
[01:55:43.326 --> 01:55:43.686]  I get it.
[01:55:43.726 --> 01:55:44.447]  This is horrible.
[01:55:44.887 --> 01:55:46.108]  Gerald Salente is coming up.
[01:55:47.188 --> 01:55:48.969]  Let's go to Alex in California.
[01:55:49.610 --> 01:55:52.811]  This is a non-financial news call, but I guess that's okay.
[01:55:53.372 --> 01:55:54.492]  Maybe people didn't hear me.
[01:55:54.512 --> 01:55:58.695]  I really want to get into your take on, are you ready to have your bank account in 401k taken?
[01:55:58.715 --> 01:56:00.116]  They're announcing that's the next plan.
[01:56:00.456 --> 01:56:03.738]  Yeah, Eurocrats told, keep dodging taxes.
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:08.062]  They don't dodge him, the Eurocrats run it.
[01:56:08.102 --> 01:56:09.984]  Sorry, go ahead Alex in California.
[01:56:11.605 --> 01:56:12.186]  Mr. Jones?
[01:56:12.506 --> 01:56:13.006]  Hey buddy.
[01:56:13.186 --> 01:56:13.647]  Very honored.
[01:56:13.747 --> 01:56:14.567]  Honored to talk to you.
[01:56:15.308 --> 01:56:16.409]  Yeah, oh geez.
[01:56:16.829 --> 01:56:20.792]  You know I had a guy come in my coffee shop, 2007, dropped off in-game.
[01:56:21.353 --> 01:56:26.217]  And he said, you watch this, and you know what, ever since, man, awesome.
[01:56:26.817 --> 01:56:30.340]  So somebody gave you in-game and it changed your political perspective forever?
[01:56:31.305 --> 01:56:33.026]  They, of course, they knew.
[01:56:33.046 --> 01:56:35.988]  I was talking, I sounded exactly like you.
[01:56:36.008 --> 01:56:38.130]  All the stuff, I just couldn't put my finger on it.
[01:56:38.570 --> 01:56:47.496]  And then they're like, hey, and I was just blabbing about nice Templar, and I was just getting, like, touching the surface, and I'm like, oh, okay, yeah, everything makes sense.
[01:56:48.463 --> 01:56:57.312]  Yeah, and now they're going to bring in world government and steal everything in front of us, daring us to start a revolution while they've got all these secret police teams ready.
[01:56:57.893 --> 01:57:01.196]  And those secret police people are going to be dead.
[01:57:01.416 --> 01:57:03.538]  I mean, that's the worst position.
[01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:05.420]  Oh my God.
[01:57:05.961 --> 01:57:09.484]  And I think that's one of our only hopes, is I've talked to the enforcers across the board.
[01:57:09.805 --> 01:57:10.625]  They're not stupid.
[01:57:11.437 --> 01:57:12.818]  Especially in tactical units.
[01:57:12.938 --> 01:57:16.980]  They know once this stuff starts, it is going to be a shooting gallery on both sides.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.562]  And it doesn't matter if they've got unmarked police cars.
[01:57:20.582 --> 01:57:22.683]  It doesn't matter if they go plainclothes.
[01:57:22.783 --> 01:57:23.563]  It doesn't matter.
[01:57:24.044 --> 01:57:29.246]  Once this starts, once you kill some veteran's buddy, he's going to come after you.
[01:57:29.587 --> 01:57:31.528]  And it's going to be some poor patrol cop.
[01:57:31.908 --> 01:57:33.469]  I mean, this is going to be a bloodbath, man.
[01:57:33.869 --> 01:57:37.551]  And I'm telling you folks, they're planning this, and we've got to stop it!
[01:57:38.291 --> 01:57:39.253]  It's all over!
[01:57:39.453 --> 01:57:40.775]  They wanna... I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[01:57:40.795 --> 01:57:41.355]  Go ahead, caller.
[01:57:41.556 --> 01:57:42.157]  Just make your point.
[01:57:42.177 --> 01:57:42.737]  I apologize.
[01:57:42.777 --> 01:57:45.281]  I just... No, there's too many points to make.
[01:57:45.321 --> 01:57:46.142]  The writing's on the wall.
[01:57:46.503 --> 01:57:47.544]  I grew up... I'm 32.
[01:57:47.604 --> 01:57:52.290]  I grew up... We didn't have... Fremont Police in Oakland East Bay, they have, like, tanks!
[01:57:53.311 --> 01:57:54.892]  They could take over anything.
[01:57:54.992 --> 01:57:55.773]  I know, I know.
[01:57:55.813 --> 01:57:57.474]  They've all been given huge tanks.
[01:57:57.534 --> 01:57:57.954]  It's more than 2,700.
[01:57:58.915 --> 01:57:59.335]  It's more than 10,000.
[01:58:00.196 --> 01:58:04.459]  And then they have Politico articles saying I'm insane, they don't exist.
[01:58:04.899 --> 01:58:07.001]  Again, they've gone full military on us.
[01:58:07.601 --> 01:58:11.644]  Listen, when they have tanks ramming your house, they'll be saying it isn't a tank.
[01:58:11.884 --> 01:58:13.105]  Do people understand that?
[01:58:13.685 --> 01:58:15.687]  They're using military tactics on us.
[01:58:17.409 --> 01:58:28.393]  You gotta call Hussain before there's no men left in the country and it's just so hard because it's so dangerous and you're towing the line all day long.
[01:58:28.573 --> 01:58:29.973]  Well, it's not just that there's no men.
[01:58:29.993 --> 01:58:33.494]  They've been putting chemicals in our food and water and people are in a trance.
[01:58:33.975 --> 01:58:36.055]  These people that are jellyfish are victims.
[01:58:36.115 --> 01:58:37.536]  They're under mind control.
[01:58:37.796 --> 01:58:38.616]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:42.057 --> 01:58:43.258]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:20.782 --> 01:59:26.986]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

[01:59:54.389 --> 01:59:56.309]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.789 --> 01:59:59.650]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.211 --> 02:00:06.871]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.531 --> 02:00:08.571]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.292 --> 02:00:10.432]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.052 --> 02:00:11.872]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.632 --> 02:00:14.533]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.553 --> 02:00:17.793]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.373 --> 02:00:22.434]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.475 --> 02:00:38.819]  Well, I gotta tell you, ladies and gentlemen, everything is proceeding as I have foreseen it.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:46.064]  And it wasn't hard, but I mean, still, it is freaky to know how right we've been, and I am freaked out.
[02:00:46.544 --> 02:00:48.545]  And if you're not freaked out, you're not paying attention.
[02:00:48.565 --> 02:00:49.506]  I love that bumper sticker.
[02:00:49.886 --> 02:00:50.766]  Seen it for 20 years.
[02:00:51.167 --> 02:00:54.569]  If you're not freaked out, or if you're not upset, you're not paying attention.
[02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:56.050]  And man, it is crazy!
[02:00:56.815 --> 02:01:19.361]  It is crazy, the time bomb, that the government's going to try to take the guns from the veterans, knowing they're going to start killing people back, and then they're going to call all veterans terrorists, which is already happening, and it's going to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, and it's going to cause total destabilization countrywide, and the globalists want that as part of their IMF plan to implode the confidence.
[02:01:21.255 --> 02:01:26.777]  In the old government to then say America failed, capitalism failed, and bring in even worse tyranny.
[02:01:27.277 --> 02:01:28.658]  I mean, whoa!
[02:01:28.778 --> 02:01:29.698]  This is bad news.
[02:01:30.319 --> 02:01:35.220]  This is super, ultra bad news on so many fronts it makes my head spin.
[02:01:37.681 --> 02:01:38.702]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:01:39.202 --> 02:01:40.262]  Gerald Cilente's coming up.
[02:01:40.282 --> 02:01:42.443]  Let's talk to Russell in Ohio.
[02:01:42.503 --> 02:01:44.424]  Russell, thanks for holding her on The Year Worldwide.
[02:01:48.342 --> 02:01:50.482]  Hey, sounds like you're calling me on an electric shaver, bro.
[02:01:50.502 --> 02:01:51.483]  Can you talk right into the phone?
[02:01:52.823 --> 02:01:53.883]  Yeah, can you hear me better now?
[02:01:54.523 --> 02:01:55.464]  Are you on a hands-free?
[02:01:56.724 --> 02:01:56.824]  No.
[02:01:56.844 --> 02:01:58.404]  Alright, we'll talk right into your phone, bro.
[02:01:58.424 --> 02:01:59.224]  I just want to be able to hear you.
[02:02:00.625 --> 02:02:01.425]  Alright, sure, okay.
[02:02:02.625 --> 02:02:06.606]  Um, well, the reason I'm calling, I'm calling about the financial news.
[02:02:07.746 --> 02:02:14.788]  Uh, the real reason that I'm calling is I've been hearing it pretty much non-stop, especially in the major media.
[02:02:16.546 --> 02:02:23.429]  Uh, just the references to Christians, Jews, Muslims, uh, well, people that say they are.
[02:02:23.449 --> 02:02:35.614]  But the big problem that I have is when you look at what they're doing, when you look at their tactics, uh, it's obvious that they basically just have their minds taken over by Satan.
[02:02:37.675 --> 02:02:40.216]  Uh... No, you're right, but your phone's just too bad, bro.
[02:02:40.236 --> 02:02:41.017]  I gotta let you go.
[02:02:43.376 --> 02:02:52.325]  No, societies go into decadence, they lose touch with reality, they lose touch with real danger, and then don't even care, as things start getting worse, they're going to get more crazy.
[02:02:52.765 --> 02:02:54.567]  They're going to demand more tyranny.
[02:02:54.587 --> 02:03:01.074]  It's like if they have their hand in a garbage disposal and it's hurting, so they push their arm in harder.
[02:03:02.175 --> 02:03:04.497]  So we're entering a very decadent cycle, yes sir.
[02:03:05.967 --> 02:03:16.474]  And then those of us that historically know it and are gearing up, they're looking at us like the food, going, they're going to be prepared, they're the terrorist, and they're basically going to make us their slaves and force labor camps.
[02:03:18.355 --> 02:03:20.717]  I mean, all these lazy people and bureaucrats aren't going to stop.
[02:03:21.497 --> 02:03:22.258]  We're the food.
[02:03:22.698 --> 02:03:24.459]  Mark in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[02:03:24.499 --> 02:03:24.919]  Go ahead.
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:27.181]  Good day, Alex Jones.
[02:03:27.221 --> 02:03:27.721]  How are you?
[02:03:28.141 --> 02:03:29.042]  I'm pretty freaked out.
[02:03:29.082 --> 02:03:30.323]  It's all unfolding.
[02:03:31.852 --> 02:03:39.398]  Well, I have to tell you, when I first heard you years ago, I didn't have much faith in you until I've seen what you said actually come true and now I'm a faithful follower.
[02:03:40.519 --> 02:03:42.060]  Well, I wish it wasn't coming true, brother.
[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:43.821]  I wish I was a laughingstock, believe me.
[02:03:44.142 --> 02:03:45.022]  But I've studied history.
[02:03:45.062 --> 02:03:47.784]  History's a lot crazier than... but go ahead and make your point.
[02:03:49.005 --> 02:03:50.927]  Okay, anyway, I'm a veteran myself.
[02:03:51.087 --> 02:03:54.910]  I'm in my late 40s now and I have family that is now in the military as well.
[02:03:56.587 --> 02:04:05.509]  Back in December, I found out that part of my family that is in the military is actually in the planning process of the attack on North Korea.
[02:04:05.549 --> 02:04:11.430]  But before that happens, we're going to have to have a black flag operation before we can actually get everyone else on board to make it happen.
[02:04:12.291 --> 02:04:16.232]  So he told you in the military they're saying they're going to stage a false flag?
[02:04:17.572 --> 02:04:18.692]  Not the false flag part.
[02:04:18.732 --> 02:04:22.133]  He told me he's in the planning process of the invasion of North Korea.
[02:04:23.133 --> 02:04:26.014]  But did he say they're being told they're going to do a provocation?
[02:04:27.313 --> 02:04:28.914]  No, they did not, but that's what I fear.
[02:04:28.934 --> 02:04:34.956]  That's what I'm afraid of that's going to happen, because I doubt that North Korea would actually fire on us, knowing how stupid that would be.
[02:04:36.157 --> 02:04:39.118]  Don't underestimate third-generational moron dictator.
[02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:42.920]  And again, I don't want to have a war, but I'd love to see those hardcore commies taken out.
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:45.221]  The problem is, again, it's part of a larger staged event.
[02:04:46.301 --> 02:04:48.362]  You know, I tell you, it's so evil.
[02:04:49.143 --> 02:04:52.604]  But I won't lose any sleep if Kim Jong-un, you know, ends up being six feet under.
[02:04:53.184 --> 02:04:54.265]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[02:04:56.974 --> 02:04:58.042]  Do you want, sir?

[02:06:01.408 --> 02:06:09.754]  The devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:06:10.054 --> 02:06:13.496]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.

[02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:09.801]  If you could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.
[02:08:09.941 --> 02:08:11.402]  What do you mean, biblical?
[02:08:11.442 --> 02:08:13.742]  What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.
[02:08:13.902 --> 02:08:15.943]  Real wrath of God type stuff.
[02:08:16.023 --> 02:08:18.043]  Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
[02:08:18.183 --> 02:08:19.524]  Rivers and seas boiling.
[02:08:19.584 --> 02:08:20.484]  Forty years of darkness.
[02:08:20.524 --> 02:08:21.644]  Earthquakes, volcanoes.
[02:08:21.664 --> 02:08:23.185]  The dead rising from the grave.
[02:08:23.245 --> 02:08:24.385]  Human sacrifice.
[02:08:24.425 --> 02:08:26.046]  Dogs and cats living together.
[02:08:26.066 --> 02:08:27.166]  Mass hysteria!
[02:08:29.182 --> 02:08:37.927]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:08:38.707 --> 02:08:39.748]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:08:40.748 --> 02:08:47.012]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:51.485 --> 02:09:02.827]  Well, the private Federal Reserve's president of the Dallas branch, one of the most powerful branches of the private Federal Reserve, has come out and said, uh, too big to fail banks are crony capitalists.
[02:09:04.407 --> 02:09:07.908]  And that it's going to destroy our economy basically forever.
[02:09:08.328 --> 02:09:22.230]  You've also got the head of the Kansas City Fed saying similar things because they understand that European banks own part of the Federal Reserve and that it's going to totally gut this country like a third world nation and there will be no more wealth generation for the general population.
[02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:28.431]  We will convert to something like Mexico or something like Nigeria, which is the plan.
[02:09:28.631 --> 02:09:32.912]  And even globalists, a lot of them, are not wanting to do that because
[02:09:34.332 --> 02:09:38.373]  It will really screw society up, and they're not really agenda 21ers.
[02:09:38.393 --> 02:09:43.175]  They're kind of old line parasites, and they want to, you know, be riding a big healthy horse.
[02:09:43.615 --> 02:09:46.936]  They don't want to butcher the horse and cut it into steaks like the globalists do.
[02:09:47.256 --> 02:09:49.277]  The globalists want to fully conquer this country.
[02:09:49.897 --> 02:09:54.778]  That is the globalists that are in charge, the kind of leftist globalists that are really authoritarians.
[02:09:55.198 --> 02:09:56.499]  Now joining us is
[02:09:57.679 --> 02:10:11.538]  Gerald Cilente, and here's his Economic Martial Law Top Trends for 2012, and we'll do a document cam shot of that for the viewers, right here in the general document cam shot area.
[02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:34.910]  And there it is for viewers out there top 12 trends and he said this a year and a half ago this came out before 2012 or almost two years ago and said they'll be bank runs they'll be bank holidays that's you know he did a little song on air it's a holiday he said it would start in the Mediterranean in Europe
[02:10:35.590 --> 02:10:36.030]  I don't know.
[02:10:56.716 --> 02:11:01.481]  His own private gold account got bought, a company he'd been trading with for 30 years or so.
[02:11:02.021 --> 02:11:15.274]  It got bought by MF Global, unbeknownst to him, and they just took his money and took billions of other people's dollars, and now they're saying 40 billion of it still hasn't been paid back, even though it's been in bankruptcy.
[02:11:15.575 --> 02:11:17.496]  So there's a couple billion totally stolen.
[02:11:18.097 --> 02:11:24.241]  And they've given some of it back, but then $40 billion total to just general creditors of MF Global itself, but he wasn't part of that.
[02:11:24.521 --> 02:11:26.863]  He just had a bank account they grabbed.
[02:11:27.463 --> 02:11:35.668]  And now they're calling it a tax when foreign banks... Cyprus won't even vote right now because of the bank holiday and the shutdown and the fire bombings.
[02:11:36.048 --> 02:11:38.990]  So now the Euro says, well, we have the power just to do it anyways.
[02:11:39.330 --> 02:11:41.252]  We put Mario Draghi over Italy.
[02:11:41.632 --> 02:11:43.633]  We put other people over Greece.
[02:11:43.973 --> 02:11:44.934]  We did that in Ireland.
[02:11:45.254 --> 02:11:46.516]  We're just going to take over.
[02:11:46.576 --> 02:11:49.219]  So this is the Imperial Banking Takeover.
[02:11:49.559 --> 02:11:56.106]  Trends Journal head, top trends forecaster Gerald Salente joins us right now.
[02:11:56.146 --> 02:11:57.668]  TrendsJournal.com.
[02:11:58.249 --> 02:12:04.976]  Gerald, break down what this means, what we're facing, and now where you see this acceleration going.
[02:12:05.874 --> 02:12:10.518]  Alright, first, very important, a trend tracking tip, I write about it all the time.
[02:12:11.159 --> 02:12:15.823]  They always do things on the weekends, so they freeze the people out.
[02:12:16.424 --> 02:12:22.629]  Whether reporting on news that they're obligated to report on, or pulling scams like this.
[02:12:23.670 --> 02:12:27.554]  So after the markets close, they always do the dirty deal.
[02:12:27.995 --> 02:12:43.050]  Whether it's a downgrade of a country's creditworthiness, releasing information about a big lie that they were covering up and are obligated to tell it about, they always do it after the markets close, after it's too late.
[02:12:43.650 --> 02:12:52.133]  And this way it stabilizes the markets, it gives them time to rig it during the weekend so it doesn't go down as much as it should.
[02:12:52.513 --> 02:12:59.395]  So again, this came out on a weekend, froze everybody out, couldn't get their dough out, number one.
[02:12:59.455 --> 02:13:03.836]  Number two, what you said, the white shoe boy lingo.
[02:13:04.336 --> 02:13:08.118]  How about calling it a tax on deposits?
[02:13:08.578 --> 02:13:09.778]  Isn't that a nice word?
[02:13:10.038 --> 02:13:11.859]  How about stealing your damn money?
[02:13:12.739 --> 02:13:17.043]  So they call it white-shoe boy language to make it seem softer.
[02:13:17.863 --> 02:13:24.909]  The other thing, another beautiful term, white-shoe boy language, they're giving depositors a haircut.
[02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:25.890]  No they're not!
[02:13:26.351 --> 02:13:27.512]  They're stealing their money!
[02:13:28.641 --> 02:13:33.682]  So, now the other thing to watch out because this is a big picture that's unfolding.
[02:13:34.582 --> 02:13:38.303]  Watch the prostitutes, listen to them, anybody could do it.
[02:13:38.623 --> 02:13:40.783]  It's all going to be put up in a little while.
[02:13:41.223 --> 02:13:46.124]  Go to CNBC, the flunkies for the money junkies.
[02:13:46.924 --> 02:13:57.426]  All they did was spend about 15 minutes talking about how Cyprus was a haven for money laundering for the Russian
[02:13:58.243 --> 02:13:58.783]  Criminals.
[02:13:58.883 --> 02:14:11.190]  So now the entire public deserves it because there's money laundering when the mega banks, the Federal Reserve, has been caught with over 400 billion in Wachovia and Wells Fargo banks and got in no trouble.
[02:14:11.210 --> 02:14:12.390]  That's Bloomberg AP.
[02:14:12.710 --> 02:14:13.151]  Exactly.
[02:14:13.171 --> 02:14:14.491]  They're going to criminalize all of us.
[02:14:14.531 --> 02:14:16.212]  Well, bank money's dirty.
[02:14:16.432 --> 02:14:19.634]  So we're taking whether you're a fireman, a teacher, a cop.
[02:14:21.234 --> 02:14:28.797]  A psychologist, a farmer, an auto mechanic, all of you get 10% of your money taken because you're a gangster!
[02:14:30.097 --> 02:14:33.158]  Exactly, but do you see what they're doing though, Alex?
[02:14:33.198 --> 02:14:34.639]  The story's much bigger.
[02:14:35.526 --> 02:14:52.958]  This new prime minister they just put in in Japan, the head of Japan, the president of the party, Xi, his first stop, Xi's first stop, A-Z-I, Xi and Xi, his first stop was to go see Putin.
[02:14:54.079 --> 02:14:56.341]  This is really an attack on Russia.
[02:14:57.657 --> 02:14:59.660]  You're talking about money laundering?
[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:02.204]  Hey, anybody hear of the Grand Cayman Islands?
[02:15:02.224 --> 02:15:03.706]  The big grand scheme?
[02:15:04.467 --> 02:15:09.434]  Did anybody ever hear of the HSBC money laundering scandal?
[02:15:09.494 --> 02:15:10.556]  Ever heard of Switzerland?
[02:15:10.696 --> 02:15:11.998]  Ever heard of Luxembourg?
[02:15:12.118 --> 02:15:13.480]  Ever heard of Monte Carlo?
[02:15:14.301 --> 02:15:14.982]  Exactly.
[02:15:15.062 --> 02:15:17.183]  So what did HSBC just pay?
[02:15:17.763 --> 02:15:22.407]  Almost $2 billion worth of fines in December for money laundering?
[02:15:22.727 --> 02:15:28.130]  So what they're doing is they're making this seem like a convoluted issue.
[02:15:28.511 --> 02:15:33.514]  The other important point, we're only talking about a $10 billion bailout here.
[02:15:34.134 --> 02:15:35.175]  This isn't a big one.
[02:15:35.635 --> 02:15:39.378]  It shows you the fragility of the entire system.
[02:15:39.958 --> 02:15:41.800]  The next important point,
[02:15:42.711 --> 02:15:46.915]  You're hearing now from the American Banking Association from D.C.
[02:15:47.355 --> 02:15:49.557]  Don't worry about it, Americans.
[02:15:49.977 --> 02:15:51.679]  Your money's insured!
[02:15:51.979 --> 02:15:54.561]  Yeah, just like it's insured over there in Cyprus.
[02:15:54.901 --> 02:16:01.627]  As a member of the Eurozone, the money's supposed to be insured for 100,000 euros, about 125,000 dollars.
[02:16:01.727 --> 02:16:04.009]  But it's not insured from them stealing it.
[02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:05.450]  Exactly.
[02:16:05.530 --> 02:16:07.912]  But here's what I believe they're going to do.
[02:16:08.473 --> 02:16:10.515]  When the crisis starts spreading,
[02:16:11.363 --> 02:16:15.585]  What they're going to do, they're going to devalue the currencies.
[02:16:16.085 --> 02:16:19.347]  So they're going to say, yeah, yeah, don't worry, your money's insured.
[02:16:19.847 --> 02:16:20.668]  But guess what?
[02:16:21.008 --> 02:16:23.209]  It's only worth a fraction of what it is.
[02:16:23.809 --> 02:16:25.370]  There's a precedent for this.
[02:16:25.450 --> 02:16:27.151]  And they'll do it during the holiday.
[02:16:27.191 --> 02:16:28.832]  Remember you did that little holiday dance?
[02:16:28.852 --> 02:16:29.552]  That's right.
[02:16:29.592 --> 02:16:32.214]  We're going to send you the videos of me doing that.
[02:16:32.474 --> 02:16:34.515]  You should be receiving them momentarily.
[02:16:34.855 --> 02:16:35.796]  But here's the rub.
[02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:40.715]  When they did it in the United States in 1933...
[02:16:44.212 --> 02:16:52.079]  They called a bank holiday, and they did it by devaluing the currency.
[02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:56.684]  Because in those days, gold was pegged to the dollar.
[02:16:57.344 --> 02:17:00.027]  Excuse me, the dollar was pegged to gold.
[02:17:00.507 --> 02:17:03.991]  The dollar was pegged to gold at about $20.65 an ounce, or thereabouts.
[02:17:07.914 --> 02:17:27.559]  After they stole all the people's gold and made them give it back on the penalty of law, they then re-pegged the price of a dollar to gold to $35 an ounce, which means that you lost 70% of your purchasing power.
[02:17:27.899 --> 02:17:28.739]  So don't worry.
[02:17:29.099 --> 02:17:30.839]  Your money's guaranteed.
[02:17:30.879 --> 02:17:32.240]  You're going to get it back.
[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:33.920]  But guess what, Jack?
[02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:38.181]  It's going to be worth a fraction of what it was before.
[02:17:38.741 --> 02:17:45.083]  And that's why you're seeing now, as we speak, gold prices are again moving back up.
[02:17:45.463 --> 02:17:52.245]  And then all of a sudden, they're again saying, hey, gold is a safe haven.
[02:17:52.725 --> 02:17:53.665]  No kidding.
[02:17:55.419 --> 02:17:59.845]  Amazing, and they've been using naked shorting to try to drive it down while you can pull it up.
[02:17:59.905 --> 02:18:07.134]  George Soros, institutions, the Communist Chinese government have been snatching gold as fast as they can.
[02:18:08.564 --> 02:18:08.885]  Right.
[02:18:09.425 --> 02:18:22.500]  And now we're looking also, when you're looking at the fragility of all this, yes, you know, the GDP, the banking, the GDP is eight times that of in Cyprus.
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:25.303]  It's eight times their GDP, which is very large.
[02:18:25.623 --> 02:18:25.703]  Yes.
[02:18:42.262 --> 02:18:43.343]  Well, here's my next point.
[02:18:43.403 --> 02:18:49.907]  Just like you said, they had to steal a few billion of people's money to prop up all of MF Global to show their fragility and didn't get in trouble.
[02:18:50.207 --> 02:18:53.790]  And you said this will only encourage them now to start stealing more.
[02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:55.811]  This is a small bite test.
[02:18:56.172 --> 02:19:01.855]  They want to see if it panics things too much, they'll back off and only take maybe 5%, 7% now they're talking about.
[02:19:02.136 --> 02:19:04.397]  Do you agree that's what this is, is a trial balloon?
[02:19:04.998 --> 02:19:06.779]  I definitely agree with it.
[02:19:07.339 --> 02:19:08.241]  I definitely agree.
[02:19:08.541 --> 02:19:16.655]  You know, there are two things, two stories that should ring in everybody's mind that tell you what it's all about.
[02:19:17.819 --> 02:19:29.028]  One, not having to do with this, but it will have to do with it later as we get closer to war, is General Dwight D. Eisenhower warning the nation that the military-industrial complex is taking it over.
[02:19:29.048 --> 02:19:37.215]  A five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and for all those Republicans out there, a two-term Republican president.
[02:19:37.555 --> 02:19:38.296]  The other one is
[02:19:39.477 --> 02:19:48.819]  The story of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, becoming violent and picking up a whip to drive the money changers out of the temple.
[02:19:49.339 --> 02:19:51.380]  This has been going on forever.
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:52.860]  These are money changers.
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:53.700]  It's fraudsters.
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:20:00.402]  They were making people give them ten silver coins for one silver coin that the rabbis would only take
[02:20:01.082 --> 02:20:15.849]  ...to pay for the offerings and ripping everybody off, and by doing that, by making them pay to make an offering to God, by turning that into a blasphemy, they were able to take over that entire society, and he physically attacked them.
[02:20:16.718 --> 02:20:17.578]  Exactly!
[02:20:17.658 --> 02:20:20.820]  So those two stories should stick in everyone's head.
[02:20:21.540 --> 02:20:24.561]  Look, James Madison, anybody could Google it up.
[02:20:25.062 --> 02:20:27.183]  He called them money changers.
[02:20:28.003 --> 02:20:30.124]  Now they call them, again, they changed the name.
[02:20:30.164 --> 02:20:32.265]  They put white shoe boy language on it.
[02:20:32.365 --> 02:20:34.646]  Andrew Jackson called them, called them vipers.
[02:20:35.663 --> 02:20:37.665]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:20:37.785 --> 02:20:39.867]  So nothing has changed.
[02:20:40.227 --> 02:20:57.023]  So when you go back to the meeting in Brussels over the weekend, oh, by the way, the people in Cyprus, like the people in Greece, like the people in Spain, like the people in Portugal, like the people in Ireland,
[02:20:57.563 --> 02:21:02.064]  They all deserve what they get, because guess what?
[02:21:02.585 --> 02:21:11.267]  Just like the people in the United States, they voted to put these lying slime balls into office.
[02:21:11.627 --> 02:21:19.370]  They just had an election in Cyprus a couple of weeks ago, and this Prime Minister, the new President,
[02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:22.551]  He vowed that he would never do this!
[02:21:23.171 --> 02:21:38.575]  You listen to the finance chairman of the Cypriot government just a week ago saying that to steal the money, but of course they didn't use that language, from the depositors, or tax the depositors, was a stupid idea!
[02:21:38.735 --> 02:21:50.880]  And by the way, remember, they've signed on to all the Euro debt, most of this is propping up derivatives, and we're giving 85 billion a month, and what, half of it, to foreign banks as part of QE Infinity.
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:53.781]  Gerald, we just skipped this network break to have more time.
[02:21:54.081 --> 02:22:03.265]  What do you expect to happen as they go into overdrive, as currencies race to devalue each other, and more and more of the inflation is upticking?
[02:22:04.286 --> 02:22:06.707]  Now, what are you calling to happen next?
[02:22:07.607 --> 02:22:10.649]  This Eurozone issue is falling apart.
[02:22:11.009 --> 02:22:13.111]  Here's the big one going on in Italy.
[02:22:13.151 --> 02:22:15.072]  They still haven't formed a government.
[02:22:15.752 --> 02:22:23.517]  And, you know, being Italian, I'm really proud of the Italians for this one in pushing forward Beppe Grillo's five-star movement.
[02:22:23.877 --> 02:22:25.798]  And that's another little story, by the way.
[02:22:25.818 --> 02:22:26.058]  That's right.
[02:22:26.098 --> 02:22:30.861]  Beppe Grillo said last week, I have the London Telegraph here just to back you up, he said, quote,
[02:22:32.968 --> 02:22:40.397]  The northern European countries are only holding on to us until the banks have recouped their investments in Italian sovereign bonds.
[02:22:40.437 --> 02:22:41.838]  Then they'll drop us like a hot potato.
[02:22:42.139 --> 02:22:48.285]  He went on to say that Mario Monti is nothing but a receivership arm for their planned bankruptcy.
[02:22:48.826 --> 02:22:49.867]  And he said... Exactly!
[02:22:49.887 --> 02:22:50.668]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:22:50.988 --> 02:23:03.258]  And so what, but it's important for everyone, you know, because of the people that listen to your station and subscribe to our Trends Journal and follow our information, you know, there are people that want to do something to make a change.
[02:23:04.019 --> 02:23:05.300]  And it's very important.
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:06.220]  That's the model.
[02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:10.003]  We're going to be writing a lot about it in the April Trends Journal.
[02:23:10.403 --> 02:23:13.004]  It was a movement, not a protest.
[02:23:13.565 --> 02:23:15.065]  Protests come and they go.
[02:23:15.766 --> 02:23:16.947]  Movements stay.
[02:23:17.547 --> 02:23:20.589]  And this movement, so you're asking me what's going to happen.
[02:23:21.209 --> 02:23:30.252]  What's going to happen is you're going to start seeing more movements taking place in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal.
[02:23:30.272 --> 02:23:32.713]  There's going to be revolutions.
[02:23:33.113 --> 02:23:35.774]  They're not able to hold this together.
[02:23:36.334 --> 02:23:40.457]  You mentioned the quantitative easing lines, the baloney.
[02:23:40.917 --> 02:23:46.341]  They only are keeping this together by dumping all of this money into the system.
[02:23:46.561 --> 02:23:47.582]  It's not working.
[02:23:47.942 --> 02:23:59.210]  It's only saving the too-big-to-fails that, as we now heard from our Attorney General Eric Himmler-Holder, that these two banks are too big to prosecute, in essence.
[02:23:59.730 --> 02:24:01.572]  They cannot keep this together.
[02:24:01.952 --> 02:24:03.513]  It's going to unravel.
[02:24:03.914 --> 02:24:05.275]  When will it fall apart?
[02:24:05.675 --> 02:24:06.396]  I don't know.
[02:24:06.836 --> 02:24:08.718]  Because here's why I don't know.
[02:24:09.579 --> 02:24:14.743]  I know when it should happen, but it's like going, it's like being a card counter.
[02:24:15.324 --> 02:24:19.687]  Going to Las Vegas, you're a great card counter, but you're losing every hand.
[02:24:19.707 --> 02:24:24.352]  And then you find out that they put another 30 cards in the deck.
[02:24:24.952 --> 02:24:25.272]  That's right.
[02:24:25.292 --> 02:24:26.173]  That's what they're doing.
[02:24:26.673 --> 02:24:28.253]  They keep changing the deck.
[02:24:28.313 --> 02:24:28.634]  That's right.
[02:24:28.654 --> 02:24:52.303]  We've reached into such an Alice in Wonderland that they said we left recession five years ago, and by every real estimate, by all the top private experts and using old numbers, old ways to break things down, we're in a depression, but they just use mind control to say that we're not, and then they replace beef with horse meat, they put more air in the chip packages, they adulterate the fuel, they do everything
[02:24:52.363 --> 02:24:57.866]  Everything they can to paper this over, but more and more the paper is peeling away.
[02:24:57.906 --> 02:25:17.317]  But going back to the Justice Department, when they come out last year and this year and say, too big to prosecute, banks are allowed to launder 400 plus billion now in drug money, the troops are ordered to grow the opium, yeah we're going to have warrantless checkpoints, yeah we're going to arrest you for filming police in public, all this police state
[02:25:17.677 --> 02:25:20.220]  When they do that, it's more than too big to fail.
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.384]  It is a green light for corporate and government crime.
[02:25:23.845 --> 02:25:25.607]  It is above the law.
[02:25:25.687 --> 02:25:28.530]  They are trumpeting that we're above the law.
[02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:29.351]  And Gerald, let me tell you this.
[02:25:30.356 --> 02:25:33.458]  We're seeing armed troops show up everywhere now.
[02:25:33.978 --> 02:25:37.560]  A National Guard, you name it, at checkpoints, even in Austin.
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:40.521]  We're seeing TSA highway checkpoints expand.
[02:25:40.841 --> 02:25:49.426]  Special Forces operations, and I've talked to the troops, they've been told, even when you're off duty, wear your uniform, wear your battle belt, wear your weapons in public.
[02:25:49.986 --> 02:25:53.247]  To get everybody ready, and they say, ready for what?
[02:25:53.287 --> 02:25:55.388]  Well, for collapse and gun confiscation.
[02:25:55.728 --> 02:26:02.551]  And I'm telling you, Gerald, if they try the gun confiscation, it is going to erupt into a civil war, which is what they want.
[02:26:02.751 --> 02:26:08.614]  I think they want to start a civil war ahead of the collapse, to blame the collapse on the civil war.
[02:26:08.934 --> 02:26:10.114]  What do you say about that?
[02:26:10.214 --> 02:26:16.657]  The move to get our guns, the two billion bullets, the armored vehicles, while they deny they're doing it.
[02:26:18.305 --> 02:26:22.766]  Well, again, they'll use something like they did with the tragedy at Sandy Hook.
[02:26:23.147 --> 02:26:25.007]  It doesn't even have to be a big one.
[02:26:25.027 --> 02:26:28.989]  You know, and they'll use that as an excuse to clamp down on us.
[02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:44.694]  And as you keep reporting, I go to your site virtually every day, and you keep putting out the information, what Homeland Security is doing, the billions of rounds of ammunition they're buying, the armoured personnel carriers, etc.
[02:26:45.794 --> 02:26:47.574]  They know it's coming down.
[02:26:48.195 --> 02:26:53.456]  They're not, they're not, they may be stupid, but they're very shrewd.
[02:26:54.156 --> 02:26:55.877]  And they're seeing it collapsing.
[02:26:55.957 --> 02:27:02.378]  And you, you, you really nailed it, Alex, when you said, are they using this as a trial balloon?
[02:27:02.858 --> 02:27:03.939]  Yes, they are.
[02:27:04.399 --> 02:27:05.339]  It's Cyprus.
[02:27:05.879 --> 02:27:13.403]  Nobody could find this damn place on the map if you didn't show 80% of the people or more where it is.
[02:27:13.863 --> 02:27:19.787]  As I said, it's only 0.2% of the entire Eurozone's GDP.
[02:27:20.247 --> 02:27:21.848]  So they're the test case.
[02:27:21.988 --> 02:27:22.228]  That's right.
[02:27:22.268 --> 02:27:24.731]  What do you make of the Russian fleet about to arrive?
[02:27:24.752 --> 02:27:28.076]  I mean, this sounds like the beginning of World War I or World War II.
[02:27:28.797 --> 02:27:37.027]  It's all the same military drawing battle lines, all this craziness, all so the bankers can play big guy and take over.
[02:27:37.908 --> 02:27:41.289]  Again, I've been saying this over and over again.
[02:27:41.749 --> 02:27:44.010]  The history is repeating itself.
[02:27:44.430 --> 02:27:50.792]  The crash of 1929, the Great Depression, currency wars, trade wars, world war.
[02:27:51.472 --> 02:27:53.053]  And we're going back into it.
[02:27:53.513 --> 02:27:57.214]  Look at the words that just came out from the Communist Party meeting.
[02:27:57.234 --> 02:27:59.395]  You know, they only go every ten years.
[02:27:59.975 --> 02:28:02.137]  And so there's been a lot of news coming out.
[02:28:02.558 --> 02:28:04.640]  It's a re-militarization.
[02:28:05.161 --> 02:28:09.165]  And they, the Chinese and Russians, against NATO.
[02:28:09.565 --> 02:28:12.188]  The alliances are already forming.
[02:28:12.208 --> 02:28:14.991]  And their proxy, North Korea, now threatening to nuke everyone.
[02:28:15.031 --> 02:28:16.733]  I mean, they're kicking off a new war.
[02:28:17.864 --> 02:28:29.133]  Well, again, I don't know if North Korea is going to nuke everyone, but I do know that the United States... Oh, here's... Sure, I meant new battle lines, a new Cold War.
[02:28:29.153 --> 02:28:29.874]  Yeah, you're right, go ahead.
[02:28:29.934 --> 02:28:31.776]  How about this for a waste of money?
[02:28:32.236 --> 02:28:35.419]  Did you hear over the weekend they're going to put more...
[02:28:37.706 --> 02:28:46.508]  Missile systems on the West Coast, just in case North Korea is going to bomb California.
[02:28:46.869 --> 02:28:49.649]  I mean, you want to talk about a waste of money?
[02:28:50.109 --> 02:29:01.112]  Here we are going down the toilet financially, and they just found a couple of billion dollars more to put up missile systems that are at best only 50% accurate.
[02:29:03.673 --> 02:29:05.295]  And against nothing.
[02:29:05.595 --> 02:29:09.719]  So what they're doing, Alex, is they're beating the war drums.
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:26.696]  So when you're asking about the Russian fleet moving in, the Russians, the Iranians, and China on one side, NATO, the United States, and the Arab Little League on the other side.
[02:29:28.979 --> 02:29:29.719]  It's incredible.
[02:29:29.899 --> 02:29:37.303]  Meanwhile, the globalists are above it all, playing all the sides off, using uncertainty to consolidate power, using rioting to implode countries.
[02:29:37.363 --> 02:29:38.523]  It's in all their own documents.
[02:29:38.883 --> 02:29:41.605]  Gerald Cilente, I want to talk about solutions and more trends.
[02:29:42.065 --> 02:29:43.586]  Straight ahead and some phone calls.
[02:29:43.606 --> 02:29:44.126]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.709 --> 02:29:51.609]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.109 --> 02:29:53.710]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.631 --> 02:29:57.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.843 --> 02:30:04.906]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:30:05.246 --> 02:30:10.712]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:30:11.292 --> 02:30:14.495]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:31:11.313 --> 02:31:17.298]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.

[02:33:04.231 --> 02:33:12.016]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:13.197 --> 02:33:15.759]  Look at this report from Fox News.
[02:33:15.979 --> 02:33:19.742]  DIMMS, Preserve US-Mexico Food Stamp Partnership,
[02:33:20.799 --> 02:33:23.640]  To advertise in Mexico for illegals to come to the U.S.
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:24.560]  and get food stamps.
[02:33:25.141 --> 02:33:26.541]  Anything to bankrupt the country.
[02:33:26.721 --> 02:33:28.982]  Anything to balkanize the nation.
[02:33:29.382 --> 02:33:32.503]  While USDA prepares for meat inspector furloughs.
[02:33:33.023 --> 02:33:36.804]  All they do is just radiate it now and they spray weird live vaccines on it.
[02:33:37.185 --> 02:33:38.725]  These viruses that eat the bacteria.
[02:33:38.765 --> 02:33:40.546]  I mean, it's just frankenfoods.
[02:33:42.069 --> 02:33:51.475]  And the article goes over all the bizarreness about the partnership with Mexican government to raise awareness about food stamps among immigrants from that country.
[02:33:51.495 --> 02:34:08.424]  The Californian government, I remember I learned this 15 years ago, I even saw the ads, I was sent the newspaper by listeners in San Diego, where the government, the state put ads in the newspapers in San Diego, but also in Mexican papers saying, come to America, have your baby for free.
[02:34:08.444 --> 02:34:10.846]  I mean, anything to bankrupt the country.
[02:34:11.306 --> 02:34:13.167]  Can I go to Mexico and have a baby for free?
[02:34:15.068 --> 02:34:25.934]  I mean, again, missiles that don't do anything on the West Coast, our own government helping give North Korea the nuclear reactors under ABB, under Clinton, and Rumsfeld was involved as the head of the company.
[02:34:26.314 --> 02:34:27.555]  Look at these articles on Drudge.
[02:34:28.055 --> 02:34:33.558]  New EU bailout plans, steel bank accounts, islands set to seize personal savings.
[02:34:34.740 --> 02:34:37.381]  Plan moves ahead as vote delayed.
[02:34:37.421 --> 02:34:38.662]  So they're like, oh, you're not going to vote for it?
[02:34:38.682 --> 02:34:39.322]  We're still going to do it.
[02:34:39.722 --> 02:34:41.043]  Putin, unfair, dangerous.
[02:34:41.603 --> 02:34:42.704]  Here come the bank runs.
[02:34:42.784 --> 02:34:44.004]  Germany, not our idea.
[02:34:44.385 --> 02:34:45.505]  Will Italy follow?
[02:34:45.545 --> 02:34:49.287]  And that's an InfoWars.com article that I wanted to ask Gerald Cilenti about.
[02:34:49.307 --> 02:34:57.971]  I'm going to bring Ted Anderson up for about three minutes to get his take as a 30-year gold and silver broker and owner of this network and also tell you about Minus Resources briefly.
[02:34:58.391 --> 02:35:01.693]  Bank chief calls for 15% looting of Italian savings.
[02:35:02.333 --> 02:35:05.556]  Is the financial rape of Cyprus another IMF riot waiting to happen?
[02:35:06.177 --> 02:35:07.738]  And then it's got the releases.
[02:35:09.062 --> 02:35:25.314]  Uh, here, uh, where the German bank chief, uh, with their central bank, uh, has come out and said that we need to have 15% of the Italians' money to not even back up their debts, but to put it into EU general debts as the EU bureaucrats are exempt.
[02:35:25.595 --> 02:35:29.377]  Gerald Cilente, Trends Forecaster with TrendsJournal.com.
[02:35:29.417 --> 02:35:33.681]  Everybody subscribe there today and sign up for the free news alerts or you're crazy.
[02:35:35.014 --> 02:35:35.875]  Knowledge is power.
[02:35:36.935 --> 02:35:47.483]  What's going to happen with the Italians if they're already on the edge of revolt over all the new VAT taxes and stuff, and the head of the IMF says they should work six, seven days a week and pay more money?
[02:35:47.983 --> 02:35:52.907]  What's going to happen now when they try to come and say, oh, Italians are criminals.
[02:35:53.687 --> 02:35:55.989]  Every man, woman, and child, we're going to take their money.
[02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:57.350]  What do you think that's going to do?
[02:35:58.109 --> 02:36:00.950]  Again, we've been writing about this, Alex.
[02:36:01.250 --> 02:36:02.731]  It's class warfare.
[02:36:03.191 --> 02:36:04.311]  That's all this is.
[02:36:05.091 --> 02:36:09.293]  You have a bunch of money junkies at the top sucking everything out of the system.
[02:36:09.753 --> 02:36:18.156]  Whether it's in Egypt, where there's no Arab Spring, whether it's Tunisia, any of these countries, it's a couple of people and their buddies on the top
[02:36:18.576 --> 02:36:25.081]  Just like the United States, where the 1% gets all the gains and the rest of us go down.
[02:36:25.401 --> 02:36:30.625]  You saw the personal income data that came out a couple of weeks ago.
[02:36:30.646 --> 02:36:31.786]  What did it decline? 3.6%?
[02:36:33.908 --> 02:36:36.350]  You know, so what's happening is the people have had it.
[02:36:36.370 --> 02:36:38.231]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:36:38.651 --> 02:36:43.274]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it!
[02:36:43.655 --> 02:36:44.675]  And they're losing it!
[02:36:44.915 --> 02:36:46.296]  They've had enough!
[02:36:46.837 --> 02:36:49.078]  They've had enough of this criminality!
[02:36:49.098 --> 02:37:03.848]  And the only thing the politicians are, are the wise guys for the crime bosses, and the crime bosses are the Goldman Sachs gang, and the Merrill Lynch mob, and the JPMorgan Chase criminals!
[02:37:03.848 --> 02:37:04.068]  Well...
[02:37:24.602 --> 02:37:26.443]  I have people in Portugal.
[02:37:26.763 --> 02:37:30.585]  They keep telling me with the suffering that people are going through.
[02:37:30.605 --> 02:37:31.225]  Oh, it's hellish.
[02:37:31.405 --> 02:37:32.726]  And that's not in our news.
[02:37:33.326 --> 02:37:34.566]  Tell folks what Europe's like.
[02:37:34.606 --> 02:37:36.447]  It's in their news, but people don't know.
[02:37:36.567 --> 02:37:37.608]  Babies being left.
[02:37:37.948 --> 02:37:38.688]  Bankruptcy.
[02:37:38.988 --> 02:37:43.950]  Whole thousands of people begging for food out of dumpsters.
[02:37:44.330 --> 02:37:47.612]  If a truck dumps a few fruits on the ground, there's riots.
[02:37:48.072 --> 02:37:52.136]  This is happening all over Southern Europe, the Mediterranean.
[02:37:52.196 --> 02:37:53.597]  It's starting into Western Europe.
[02:37:53.857 --> 02:37:56.580]  Do people have any idea how big a powder keg this is?
[02:37:56.860 --> 02:38:01.224]  And then the government of Europe is arming itself and aiming its weapons outward.
[02:38:01.745 --> 02:38:02.986]  Just incredible tyranny.
[02:38:03.226 --> 02:38:04.807]  And how they exempt themselves.
[02:38:04.847 --> 02:38:05.687]  I keep going back to that.
[02:38:06.127 --> 02:38:10.950]  How the EU bureaucrats exempt themselves from the EU-wide VAT and income tax.
[02:38:11.210 --> 02:38:13.011]  I mean, they should all be arrested right there.
[02:38:13.231 --> 02:38:14.051]  Look at LIBOR.
[02:38:14.531 --> 02:38:16.152]  All of it rigged against the people.
[02:38:16.192 --> 02:38:17.192]  They should all go to jail.
[02:38:17.393 --> 02:38:18.073]  But they don't.
[02:38:18.333 --> 02:38:19.874]  So why shouldn't they steal more?
[02:38:20.094 --> 02:38:22.855]  Because they want to make everybody poor as a tool of control.
[02:38:22.915 --> 02:38:25.436]  And thank God we've got guns, Gerald.
[02:38:25.696 --> 02:38:31.059]  Because just the fact the guns are there, they're afraid to really rape us as hard as they are the Europeans.
[02:38:31.752 --> 02:38:40.023]  The biggest mistake that this administration made, in my estimation, is this whole push for gun control.
[02:38:40.704 --> 02:38:46.531]  Because what they did was they rallied a group of people that may have not been rallied before.
[02:38:47.212 --> 02:38:49.735]  So now more people have come under the umbrella.
[02:38:50.396 --> 02:38:53.999]  The umbrella of losing your individual rights.
[02:38:54.380 --> 02:38:55.901]  This isn't about guns.
[02:38:56.361 --> 02:38:57.462]  It's about rights.
[02:38:57.983 --> 02:39:00.105]  And they keep being taken away from us.
[02:39:00.545 --> 02:39:02.607]  It was a huge mistake they made.
[02:39:03.007 --> 02:39:09.613]  Because they brought in millions and millions of people that probably wouldn't have given a damn about other issues.
[02:39:09.953 --> 02:39:11.295]  But now it's hitting them.
[02:39:11.895 --> 02:39:16.157]  It's hitting their own psychology before it was out of their minds.
[02:39:16.617 --> 02:39:20.378]  If they, if they, oh, so what, there's warrantless wiretapping.
[02:39:20.398 --> 02:39:23.119]  Yeah, it sounds terrible, but what do I care?
[02:39:23.519 --> 02:39:26.560]  So what about the National Defense Authorization Act?
[02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:28.421]  It doesn't affect me.
[02:39:28.861 --> 02:39:33.743]  But now it's a direct effect and it brought a lot more people into the fold.
[02:39:34.223 --> 02:39:39.485]  And going back to what's going on in Europe, again, look who's running
[02:39:40.245 --> 02:39:44.628]  The central bank in Europe, Mario Draghi.
[02:39:44.989 --> 02:39:47.130]  Who is Mario Draghi?
[02:39:47.831 --> 02:39:54.356]  He was a former vice chairman of the Goldman Sachs European division.
[02:39:54.876 --> 02:39:58.779]  Who's the guy that's taking over now at the Bank of England?
[02:39:59.983 --> 02:40:01.104]  Mark Carney.
[02:40:01.704 --> 02:40:02.704]  Who is he with?
[02:40:03.385 --> 02:40:04.545]  Goldman Sachs.
[02:40:05.065 --> 02:40:09.807]  Who was the guy that started this whole too-big-to-fail scam going?
[02:40:10.368 --> 02:40:14.870]  Henry Paulson, former Treasury Secretary under George Bush.
[02:40:15.330 --> 02:40:17.291]  Where was he before he came here?
[02:40:17.931 --> 02:40:19.732]  The chairman of Goldman Sachs.
[02:40:20.312 --> 02:40:25.895]  Who was the guy that deregulated Glass-Steagall, got it into motion under Clinton?
[02:40:26.775 --> 02:40:28.576]  Could have been Robert Rubin, could it?
[02:40:29.571 --> 02:40:32.392]  No, he was with Goldman Sachs, too, and the chairman.
[02:40:33.272 --> 02:40:35.593]  Can't anybody put this together?
[02:40:35.613 --> 02:40:40.055]  It's a banking takeover worldwide.
[02:40:40.435 --> 02:40:42.576]  That's all this is.
[02:40:43.336 --> 02:40:45.617]  And what they're going to do, I believe in it.
[02:40:45.957 --> 02:40:48.218]  Oh, here's the message I want to tell everybody.
[02:40:49.418 --> 02:40:54.320]  If you think you have your money in the bank and it's yours, you better grow up.
[02:40:55.222 --> 02:41:02.288]  And I've told everyone the stories of what's happened to me several times trying to withdraw a sizable deposit.
[02:41:02.368 --> 02:41:06.812]  Every time you're on, you say they will take your money out of the bank.
[02:41:07.173 --> 02:41:08.614]  They will just grab it.
[02:41:08.954 --> 02:41:10.315]  They will take percentages.
[02:41:10.375 --> 02:41:12.177]  Now they're sitting there and taking 401Ks.
[02:41:12.537 --> 02:41:15.260]  Now they're ordering companies to invest in too-big-to-fail bonds.
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:16.560]  I mean, it's on.
[02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:25.682]  They are going to steal everything in increments, and my wife's going to get a few thousand dollars, and they freak out and ask her if she's a criminal, and she's like, we've been at this bank for five years.
[02:41:26.623 --> 02:41:28.783]  I mean, again, they're the crooks.
[02:41:29.843 --> 02:41:35.285]  And another thing that we did on the Trends in the News, we sent you that video on February 27th.
[02:41:37.048 --> 02:41:43.070]  We said, watch out, stay very closely tuned to what's going on in March.
[02:41:43.690 --> 02:41:47.131]  March to April, we said something is going to come down.
[02:41:47.572 --> 02:41:52.933]  I went back to our 1999 trend forecast of the dot-com bubble burst.
[02:41:52.953 --> 02:41:56.715]  It's right there on the Trends Journal, on our site, TrendsJournal.com.
[02:41:57.035 --> 02:42:01.857]  And I said the dot-com bubble would burst by the second quarter of 2000.
[02:42:03.597 --> 02:42:05.378]  It blew apart in March.
[02:42:06.298 --> 02:42:09.321]  March is one of those months, like October.
[02:42:10.062 --> 02:42:13.325]  You could go throughout history, you always see it repeating itself.
[02:42:13.785 --> 02:42:18.790]  This Cyprus issue, although it's a small country, it's a huge event.
[02:42:20.111 --> 02:42:24.555]  In days, if not weeks, it'll be forgotten by most people.
[02:42:25.035 --> 02:42:26.517]  And then they're going to wake up to it.
[02:42:27.077 --> 02:42:28.379]  Most won't wake up to it.
[02:42:29.119 --> 02:42:37.261]  The next thing is going to hit is going to be a major hit from either Spain, Portugal, or Italy.
[02:42:37.702 --> 02:42:39.542]  And my money's on Italy.
[02:42:40.042 --> 02:42:44.024]  Because in Italy, they cannot form a government.
[02:42:44.444 --> 02:42:49.365]  Beppe Grillo will have no part of the corrupt system that's in place.
[02:42:49.925 --> 02:42:51.706]  When will the people wise up?
[02:42:52.586 --> 02:42:57.728]  Nothing is going to change in this country with the systems that are in place now.
[02:42:57.768 --> 02:43:00.009]  So the bottom line is, pull your money out of the bank.
[02:43:00.049 --> 02:43:01.489]  That's what you're saying personally.
[02:43:01.789 --> 02:43:04.991]  That's what everybody, in my view, needs to do.
[02:43:05.391 --> 02:43:12.673]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, the system will steal your money and is arming against us like common criminals.
[02:43:12.693 --> 02:43:13.794]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up.
[02:43:13.834 --> 02:43:14.974]  Wait, I want to say that.
[02:43:15.034 --> 02:43:16.655]  I'm not telling people what to do.
[02:43:16.675 --> 02:43:20.116]  Because if anything, I'm only speaking for myself.
[02:43:20.356 --> 02:43:21.797]  No, no, I said I personally.
[02:43:21.817 --> 02:43:30.222]  I personally, but we have listeners calling in saying, what will it do if everybody worldwide started pulling their money out of the bank ahead of them doing this incrementally?
[02:43:30.862 --> 02:43:33.244]  I believe it'll straighten the system out.
[02:43:36.553 --> 02:43:40.675]  But, I mean, there's only 2-3% actual cash on average for Europe and the U.S.
[02:43:41.715 --> 02:43:43.036]  for actual money out there.
[02:43:43.416 --> 02:43:45.537]  Do you think that would send a shot across their bow?
[02:43:45.737 --> 02:43:46.357]  Oh, yeah!
[02:43:46.737 --> 02:43:50.799]  Yeah, it'll bring down these too-big-to-fail so we can get business going again.
[02:43:51.239 --> 02:43:55.121]  So local banks can start building again.
[02:43:55.141 --> 02:43:56.421]  So what do they have?
[02:43:56.461 --> 02:43:58.082]  Over 80% of the action.
[02:43:58.162 --> 02:43:58.922]  Seven banks?
[02:43:59.182 --> 02:43:59.382]  Sure.
[02:43:59.402 --> 02:44:00.483]  Who made this stuff up?
[02:44:00.683 --> 02:44:03.005]  We do have that video clip.
[02:44:03.105 --> 02:44:06.908]  It says February 27th, but was this a year ago or two years ago?
[02:44:06.928 --> 02:44:08.810]  No, it was just past February.
[02:44:09.310 --> 02:44:10.491]  A couple of weeks ago.
[02:44:10.612 --> 02:44:12.693]  I said, watch out what's going to happen in March.
[02:44:13.754 --> 02:44:16.457]  Okay, but I remember you years ago.
[02:44:16.477 --> 02:44:17.297]  That's the bank.
[02:44:17.397 --> 02:44:18.839]  No, that comes later on.
[02:44:19.199 --> 02:44:20.000]  Those are the ones.
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:21.801]  That's the watching out in March.
[02:44:22.161 --> 02:44:26.165]  Later on after that clip are the other ones about the holidays.
[02:44:26.693 --> 02:44:29.755]  Okay, so is it all one clip, guys, or is it multiple clips?
[02:44:29.775 --> 02:44:32.757]  Because my issue is we just got this and I want to play it.
[02:44:33.977 --> 02:44:35.078]  Okay, so we were sent one clip.
[02:44:35.098 --> 02:44:38.580]  Gerald, are you saying in the one clip is a group of clips of you predicting it?
[02:44:38.820 --> 02:44:39.040]  Yes.
[02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:45.604]  Go past the February 27th one and go to the bank holiday ones.
[02:44:45.704 --> 02:44:52.028]  Okay, well, while we're finding that in the clip, I want to bring Ted Anderson up because, again, I'm the same way as Gerald.
[02:44:52.848 --> 02:45:04.956]  I'm not going to tell you what I think you should do, but I personally have bought firearms, a rural property, and gold and silver, and it is all done very, very well.
[02:45:04.976 --> 02:45:06.277]  But I don't have it to do well.
[02:45:06.757 --> 02:45:08.999]  I do it because I can't trust this criminal system.
[02:45:09.559 --> 02:45:14.943]  And I want to bring Ted Anderson up to get his brief take on all this, because he's predicted this for many years as well.
[02:45:14.963 --> 02:45:16.684]  I mean, this is what governments do.
[02:45:17.184 --> 02:45:19.125]  Ted, how close do you think we're getting towards
[02:45:20.066 --> 02:45:21.707]  A more accelerated meltdown.
[02:45:21.927 --> 02:45:24.089]  They had to know this was going to cause a panic.
[02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:27.491]  Do you agree with Gerald and I that they did this as a trial balloon?
[02:45:28.131 --> 02:45:35.476]  Well, you know, Alex, when you see a place like Cyprus falling apart and causing problems, I mean, we're talking about a little blip on the map.
[02:45:35.516 --> 02:45:36.217]  This is not...
[02:45:36.797 --> 02:45:43.564]  A big economic superpower, and yet it drives the value of gold right over $1,600 an ounce.
[02:45:43.584 --> 02:45:45.386]  We've seen a $50 increase there.
[02:45:45.866 --> 02:45:46.667]  Silver's up, too.
[02:45:47.027 --> 02:45:51.131]  I mean, obviously, we have a lot of problems in the economy.
[02:45:51.171 --> 02:45:59.119]  The Fed and the central banks of the world are trying to prop up this whole thing by keeping the interest rates low, meanwhile taking care of, like,
[02:46:01.241 --> 02:46:05.122]  Like you guys have been talking about, they're just taking care of their own, that's all.
[02:46:05.422 --> 02:46:10.123]  They're destroying the economy for everybody else, but they're bailing out the too-big-to-fail.
[02:46:11.264 --> 02:46:16.485]  Just like Gerald is saying, we're right on the edge, we're on the cusp of a huge problem.
[02:46:16.885 --> 02:46:24.507]  And it's so mind-boggling that things are holding together, but it's like stuck together with tax and staples.
[02:46:25.407 --> 02:46:26.027]  Absolutely.
[02:46:26.047 --> 02:46:31.269]  Well, you've got that free report, 10 Reasons to Own Gold, for people to make their own decision, their own research.
[02:46:31.289 --> 02:46:34.129]  But I personally am making the decision.
[02:46:34.149 --> 02:46:36.190]  I don't even have that much money in the bank anyways.
[02:46:36.570 --> 02:46:39.171]  I've invested it all, getting the word out here at Infowars.com.
[02:46:39.191 --> 02:46:46.273]  But, I mean, it's time to just realize that you can't even have operating capital, hardly, in the bank for, you know, our news operation, because they could steal that.
[02:46:46.693 --> 02:46:47.814]  And then we're just shut down.
[02:46:47.854 --> 02:46:56.522]  I mean, it's really crazy, and it's going to hurt business that banks and government are so untrustworthy, and that's part of what collapses society.
[02:46:56.602 --> 02:47:05.831]  I hope people will give Midas Resources a call, and we'll check out the great gold and silver deals you've got, because I believe now is the time to get involved, and I personally am going to double down.
[02:47:05.851 --> 02:47:08.834]  I mean, look at this article I've got from Bloomberg last year.
[02:47:08.934 --> 02:47:12.317]  Soros buying gold as record prices seen on stimulus.
[02:47:12.697 --> 02:47:14.217]  Give Midas a call at 800-686-2237.
[02:47:14.237 --> 02:47:16.258]  800-686-2237.
[02:47:16.498 --> 02:47:25.620]  And again, Ted's a big sponsor of the show and also the owner of the Radio Network and just the best gold and silver broker out there in my humble view.
[02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:36.363]  But going back to Gerald, Gerald, is there anything you personally want to add on this banking issue with how you've tried to get money out before, not even that much, and then act like you're some type of criminal?
[02:47:37.223 --> 02:47:41.204]  And how this hurts the economy that banks can't be trusted now.
[02:47:41.988 --> 02:47:45.150]  Well, again, you know, you mentioned about how they're rigging everything.
[02:47:45.170 --> 02:47:46.511]  You mentioned about the LIBOR.
[02:47:46.531 --> 02:47:48.012]  And we're talking about what?
[02:47:48.372 --> 02:47:50.894]  About $600 trillion worth of rigging?
[02:47:51.515 --> 02:47:54.437]  And then you want to see a rig that's right in front of everybody's eyes?
[02:47:54.457 --> 02:47:55.818]  How about the bond market?
[02:47:56.358 --> 02:47:58.580]  You don't have to make it up.
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:03.683]  You see the money that they're dumping into the system every month.
[02:48:03.703 --> 02:48:08.607]  $85 billion plus that we don't know about, beyond the $85 billion that we know.
[02:48:09.167 --> 02:48:13.470]  So what I'm saying is for people to use their own common sense.
[02:48:14.091 --> 02:48:15.452]  Look what's going on.
[02:48:15.792 --> 02:48:21.757]  Do you think the Europeans right now aren't pulling their money out of their bank accounts?
[02:48:22.437 --> 02:48:27.061]  Don't you think that they're freaking out because they see what's going on?
[02:48:27.561 --> 02:48:31.665]  This deal, when I've been reading everything coming out on it,
[02:48:32.205 --> 02:48:39.789]  When the people from Cyprus, the President and the Finance Minister, went to Brussels, the deal was already done.
[02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:43.671]  The Germans told them what they were going to do.
[02:48:44.192 --> 02:48:48.054]  And they were going to take the money from the depositors.
[02:48:48.494 --> 02:48:49.975]  And where's the money going?
[02:48:50.355 --> 02:48:58.419]  The money is going... It's not... They talk about the banks in Cyprus, and they talk about the banks in Italy and in Spain.
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:48:58.840]  No, no.
[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:11.702]  These are the big German banks, the Finnish banks, the Dutch banks, the Belgian banks that loaned all these banks in the smaller countries the money to loan out.
[02:49:12.282 --> 02:49:14.263]  They didn't get that money on their own.
[02:49:14.623 --> 02:49:22.024]  So what they're doing is they're really taking this money from the bottom so they could pay off the big guys at the top.
[02:49:22.324 --> 02:49:28.405]  So all I'm saying is if anybody thinks that they're not going to screw you,
[02:49:28.965 --> 02:49:30.366]  Well, good for you!
[02:49:30.606 --> 02:49:36.170]  And you personally, I know Ted's more than half into gold and investments and savings.
[02:49:37.571 --> 02:49:39.652]  You personally are a firm believer in gold and silver.
[02:49:40.299 --> 02:49:55.327]  All my investments are in gold and silver, and the only other investments I have are the historic buildings that I buy in Colonial Kingston, because this is where the first American Revolution had a lot of its roots, and I want to do the second one.
[02:49:55.707 --> 02:49:57.548]  Other than that, that's it.
[02:49:58.028 --> 02:50:02.891]  Gold and silver, and a good friend of mine, I think, has the best strategy.
[02:50:03.671 --> 02:50:05.973]  Every month he buys what he can afford.
[02:50:06.753 --> 02:50:07.853]  In gold and silver.
[02:50:08.113 --> 02:50:09.194]  So you think about it.
[02:50:09.814 --> 02:50:13.095]  You just saw gold go down, what, to 15?
[02:50:13.175 --> 02:50:15.956]  I forgot what the low was in this recent downturn.
[02:50:16.236 --> 02:50:17.276]  And now it's back over 1600.
[02:50:18.657 --> 02:50:24.579]  So when you keep buying every month, then you start seeing this thing really averaging out.
[02:50:24.879 --> 02:50:34.642]  Oh, and by the way, for all of those people that watch CNBC and believe the hype and how wonderful the markets are doing, check it out.
[02:50:35.751 --> 02:50:46.255]  When the markets were at where they are now, back in 2007, I think gold was about $760-something.
[02:50:46.675 --> 02:50:48.015]  Around there.
[02:50:48.656 --> 02:50:49.316]  What's it now?
[02:50:49.336 --> 02:50:49.316]  $1,600.
[02:50:50.716 --> 02:50:52.997]  Oh, and what's the market now?
[02:50:53.397 --> 02:50:56.018]  Oh, it got back to where it was in 2007.
[02:50:56.058 --> 02:50:59.339]  And it's with devalued dollars, so it's inflationary.
[02:50:59.359 --> 02:51:00.820]  We'll be right back with his prediction.
[02:51:02.099 --> 02:51:05.603]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[02:51:05.903 --> 02:51:08.967]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[02:51:09.147 --> 02:51:11.570]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[02:51:11.950 --> 02:51:13.872]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[02:51:14.093 --> 02:51:16.936]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[02:52:01.300 --> 02:52:03.241]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:03.682 --> 02:52:06.383]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:52:06.984 --> 02:52:12.587]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will shock you.
[02:52:13.128 --> 02:52:20.953]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:52:21.994 --> 02:52:25.057]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:52:25.358 --> 02:52:27.180]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:34.489]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:52:34.989 --> 02:52:39.475]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:52:39.975 --> 02:52:45.878]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:52:46.199 --> 02:52:46.979]  You'll be shocked.
[02:52:47.539 --> 02:52:52.262]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[02:52:52.762 --> 02:52:57.825]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:52:58.245 --> 02:52:59.806]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:52:59.886 --> 02:53:05.149]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:05.810 --> 02:53:07.911]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:08.821 --> 02:53:17.165]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.805 --> 02:53:22.707]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:23.343 --> 02:53:34.312]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:34.713 --> 02:53:41.719]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:42.399 --> 02:53:46.660]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:46.700 --> 02:53:49.861]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:50.781 --> 02:53:57.243]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:53:57.543 --> 02:53:58.563]  Protect your immune system.
[02:53:58.823 --> 02:53:59.883]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:53:59.903 --> 02:54:06.745]  You look like an angel
[02:54:09.477 --> 02:54:10.923]  Walk like an angel.
[02:54:11.485 --> 02:54:14.014]  Talk like an angel.
[02:54:17.403 --> 02:54:28.233]  Well, this is devil out in the open, not devil in disguise in the New World Order.
[02:54:28.733 --> 02:54:30.014]  Trendsjournal.com.
[02:54:30.034 --> 02:54:31.716]  He's going to do 30 minutes of overdrive with us.
[02:54:31.756 --> 02:54:34.018]  Ted's going to pop in a little bit in the next segment.
[02:54:34.038 --> 02:54:35.199]  We're going to take a few calls.
[02:54:35.599 --> 02:54:36.880]  People that want to talk to Gerald at 800-259-9231.
[02:54:40.243 --> 02:54:46.527]  Now we've got predictions here in this compilation he sent us from last year in June, but here's the first one.
[02:54:46.547 --> 02:54:53.651]  I think it's February 27th of this year, just a month or so ago, predicting what we're now seeing unfold.
[02:54:53.691 --> 02:54:56.412]  So now TV viewers can see the dates.
[02:54:56.732 --> 02:54:59.354]  For radio listeners, I'll mention the date during the clips.
[02:54:59.374 --> 02:55:02.836]  This will take us to the end of the hour, then we'll come back with Gerald's response.
[02:55:03.236 --> 02:55:04.177]  Let's go to the first clip.
[02:55:04.557 --> 02:55:07.819]  Yankee puts case for benefits of easing.
[02:55:08.678 --> 02:55:14.643]  Fed Chairman in combative mood as he defends continuing asset purchases.
[02:55:15.304 --> 02:55:22.850]  Ben Bernanke's mission for his trip to Congress yesterday was to explain why the benefits of the U.S.
[02:55:22.890 --> 02:55:32.618]  Federal Reserve's third $85 billion a month round of quantitative easing will outweigh its costs and risks.
[02:55:34.175 --> 02:55:36.276]  So let's make this 100% clear.
[02:55:37.077 --> 02:55:42.981]  The only reason these markets are improving is because of all this cheap money being flooded into it.
[02:55:44.702 --> 02:55:46.243]  March is an important month.
[02:55:47.463 --> 02:55:57.670]  If you go back to October of 1999, I wrote in the Trends Journal that the dot-com bubble would burst.
[02:55:59.073 --> 02:56:06.260]  Before the end of the second quarter of 2000, it's right there for everyone to look at, and it did, it burst in March.
[02:56:07.001 --> 02:56:09.323]  There's a lot of pessimism in the markets now.
[02:56:10.004 --> 02:56:16.150]  March and April are going to be critical months to see where the future is taking us in the financial markets.
[02:56:16.910 --> 02:56:19.473]  I urge you to stay tuned very closely.
[02:56:21.781 --> 02:56:28.907]  Again, when you look at these facts and the numbers, the only thing that's holding it together are low interest rates.
[02:56:29.007 --> 02:56:33.311]  And not only here, also around the world, as I keep mentioning.
[02:56:33.331 --> 02:56:38.676]  Alright, here he is a year earlier, back in June.
[02:56:40.595 --> 02:56:56.961]  Gold investment demand in China advanced 10% because of buyers seeking a haven from Europe's debt crisis and the prospects of weakening currencies according to the country's largest bullion bank.
[02:56:57.581 --> 02:57:00.482]  Exactly what I've been saying!
[02:57:00.502 --> 02:57:02.503]  Oh, bank runs!
[02:57:02.963 --> 02:57:04.244]  Dun-da-da-da!
[02:57:05.336 --> 02:57:10.758]  Holiday, they call the bank holiday in Italy.
[02:57:10.778 --> 02:57:12.739]  That's right, people are freaking out.
[02:57:13.519 --> 02:57:18.981]  To me, anybody that has a lot of dough in the bank and gets it taken from them when they call a holiday.
[02:57:19.821 --> 02:57:23.162]  Remember, you heard it coming, you saw it coming, you knew it was going to come.
[02:57:25.043 --> 02:57:26.903]  Here he is back in 2012 as well.
[02:57:31.172 --> 02:57:32.132]  In the Trends Journal.
[02:57:32.172 --> 02:57:34.013]  We're putting it on screen for radio listeners.
[02:57:34.973 --> 02:57:38.774]  And that was, well that was about, that was before 2012.
[02:57:38.955 --> 02:57:42.736]  They made the prediction in 2012 that that would start unfolding.
[02:57:43.336 --> 02:57:45.257]  And then he's got blow-ups of it.
[02:57:45.997 --> 02:57:48.978]  The conditions continue to deteriorate that you would see.
[02:57:49.798 --> 02:57:52.079]  Panicked type activities and bank holidays.
[02:57:52.159 --> 02:57:54.900]  And we've also predicted on the show that they would grab money.
[02:57:54.940 --> 02:57:57.560]  Now this is out of the, from my broadcast, December 27, 2011.
[02:57:59.628 --> 02:58:01.509]  They were talking about declaring a bank holiday.
[02:58:01.849 --> 02:58:02.349]  That's right.
[02:58:02.689 --> 02:58:04.890]  This is June 2009.
[02:58:05.450 --> 02:58:20.536]  Biden's words are, as soon as we got sworn in, the first thing at the top of our list, we had to transition the team there and 30 economists, was whether or not to call a bank holiday.
[02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:22.801]  This is no holiday, folks!
[02:58:51.351 --> 02:58:58.336]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:58:58.576 --> 02:59:16.188]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:59:16.468 --> 02:59:20.571]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:59:21.051 --> 02:59:30.478]  The longevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:59:30.778 --> 02:59:36.882]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:59:37.082 --> 02:59:38.143]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:59:38.363 --> 02:59:39.103]  It's incredible.
[02:59:39.243 --> 02:59:48.289]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:59:48.450 --> 02:59:50.291]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:59:52.293 --> 02:59:53.475]  Coast to coast.
[02:59:53.836 --> 02:59:55.178]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.899 --> 02:59:59.103]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.038 --> 03:00:10.162]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.883 --> 03:00:11.684]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.465 --> 03:00:13.426]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.006 --> 03:00:17.610]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.211 --> 03:00:22.255]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.041 --> 03:00:31.485]  I really like how Gerald does the news, and I routinely go over to his site and watch his daily news briefs and weekly news briefs.
[03:00:31.986 --> 03:00:36.909]  Sitting behind his great bar there at his old family grocery store that he converted into an office.
[03:00:37.970 --> 03:00:38.851]  My crew's been up there.
[03:00:38.871 --> 03:00:42.233]  It'd be great to be in that neighborhood in front of Gerald, drop by, have a beer with him.
[03:00:42.834 --> 03:00:43.854]  Ted Anderson's with us.
[03:00:43.894 --> 03:00:45.456]  Ted, you just heard some of those predictions.
[03:00:45.936 --> 03:00:51.961]  We're going to come back in the next segment and play the one we haven't gotten to and go to some calls with Gerald Cilente, but this is really a no-brainer.
[03:00:52.622 --> 03:00:55.584]  What's your comments on where we see this going?
[03:00:55.624 --> 03:01:01.329]  I mean, don't the globalists know that MF Global and stuff like this is only going to destroy confidence in them?
[03:01:01.610 --> 03:01:07.455]  I mean, you've even got the Federal Reserve head of Dallas coming out and saying, this is crony capitalism and it's going to destroy us.
[03:01:08.598 --> 03:01:11.561]  Well, it sure is going to destroy us, and Gerald is right on target.
[03:01:11.701 --> 03:01:14.563]  I mean, he's been right on for how many years now?
[03:01:14.603 --> 03:01:17.646]  I mean, Alex, I mean, it's been years and years and years of predictions.
[03:01:18.107 --> 03:01:27.095]  You cannot continue to print money and bail out your friends and make a great deal for them and screw the people.
[03:01:27.535 --> 03:01:29.016]  Without having consequences.
[03:01:29.056 --> 03:01:30.896]  And we're seeing those consequences.
[03:01:30.956 --> 03:01:32.697]  Yeah, they could have set up the Cyprus thing.
[03:01:32.717 --> 03:01:39.799]  I mean, how could one little island like this, you know, throw an economic earthquake into the entire world's economy?
[03:01:39.859 --> 03:01:41.200]  I mean, it just doesn't make sense.
[03:01:41.660 --> 03:01:46.021]  If people are smart, they will be getting out of the paper and getting into gold and silver.
[03:01:46.381 --> 03:01:47.482]  I mean, just like Gerald said.
[03:01:47.502 --> 03:01:49.942]  I mean, I own some buildings, too, because I have to operate.
[03:01:49.962 --> 03:01:51.123]  I've been to Gerald's place.
[03:01:51.163 --> 03:01:52.343]  It's a beautiful place.
[03:01:52.983 --> 03:01:54.344]  And I need to tell you,
[03:01:55.024 --> 03:01:59.827]  If you're sitting in the bank, if you have your money in paper, I think you're making a big mistake.
[03:01:59.867 --> 03:02:01.208]  You just really are.
[03:02:01.248 --> 03:02:01.728]  I agree.
[03:02:01.988 --> 03:02:03.989]  Ted, briefly, what are some of the best gold specials?
[03:02:04.069 --> 03:02:07.772]  People can always call and ask about the radio special every day, and you'll have the lowest prices.
[03:02:07.792 --> 03:02:10.273]  I know you even have gold you bought before it went back up.
[03:02:10.373 --> 03:02:12.875]  Most dealers are going to charge more now that it's gone up.
[03:02:13.195 --> 03:02:14.516]  You're freezing your prices.
[03:02:14.556 --> 03:02:16.517]  How long can you do that until you run out of your supplies?
[03:02:17.097 --> 03:02:23.379]  I mean, Alex, I have to roll with the market too, but right now I do have some really good prices because the market just ran up another $12.
[03:02:23.419 --> 03:02:27.700]  I mean, it's up over $50, really, if you look at it from the bottom.
[03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:30.281]  Franks right now are at $350.93.
[03:02:30.401 --> 03:02:33.842]  We have the Walking Liberty halves, they're at $16.17.
[03:02:34.943 --> 03:02:37.403]  Rounds, you know, just the clean silver rounds are at $32.12.
[03:02:40.144 --> 03:02:43.248]  Canadian maple leaves right now are at $1,751.
[03:02:43.848 --> 03:02:44.889]  There's a lot of different things.
[03:02:44.929 --> 03:02:46.731]  British Sovereign's at $440.
[03:02:47.272 --> 03:02:52.637]  The thing about it is that you need to get into gold and silver as you can afford it, just like Gerald was explaining.
[03:02:52.977 --> 03:02:54.679]  If you can buy some, buy some.
[03:02:54.739 --> 03:02:55.280]  Put it away.
[03:02:55.660 --> 03:03:05.927]  One of the things he can do, which really covers the banking issue more than anything I can think of other than Gerald's Trends Journal, is that Dishonest Money, American Dream, and Obama Deception video.
[03:03:06.347 --> 03:03:20.416]  I mean, for $72, and we do take credit cards, you can get two pieces of silver, and these are the silver dollars that were meant as constitutional money two decades ago, or two centuries ago, the turn of the last century, for $72.
[03:03:22.677 --> 03:03:25.859]  And the reason why I like that so much is it's more about the education.
[03:03:26.179 --> 03:03:30.281]  They get to see what's going on with your Obama deception, which covers the banking system, by the way.
[03:03:30.321 --> 03:03:31.661]  It's not really about Obama.
[03:03:32.001 --> 03:03:34.342]  It's about who's pulling the puppet strings.
[03:03:34.402 --> 03:03:35.703]  And all the predictions that came true.
[03:03:35.723 --> 03:03:39.205]  Then you've got the dishonest money breaking down the banking system, the Federal Reserve.
[03:03:39.485 --> 03:03:41.466]  Then you've got the American Dream cartoon.
[03:03:42.126 --> 03:03:43.267]  I really wouldn't show it to kids.
[03:03:43.307 --> 03:03:44.147]  It's a little racy.
[03:03:44.507 --> 03:03:48.149]  But it's really great exposing the New World Order, the Rothschilds, how it all works.
[03:03:48.689 --> 03:03:53.236]  The two silver dollars it costs, shipping included, and over $60 in free stuff.
[03:03:53.697 --> 03:03:56.040]  As a loss leader, to introduce you to Midas Resources, 800-686-2237.
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:03:56.100]  800-686-237.
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:57.202]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[03:03:57.222 --> 03:03:58.444]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:04:03.712 --> 03:04:03.932]  You bet.
[03:04:03.972 --> 03:04:18.667]  We're gonna come back with Gerald Cilente and get his take on the videos we just aired in the last hour and audio of him predicting the holiday and finish up that clip and then see how he thinks we can defeat these people and how far he thinks in his gut this will go.
[03:04:18.687 --> 03:04:23.091]  And as he said, in this Alice in Wonderland world, who knows where it's all going?
[03:04:23.752 --> 03:04:24.993]  Because they could totally, you know...
[03:04:25.934 --> 03:04:26.514]  Do anything!
[03:04:26.554 --> 03:04:27.194]  I mean, who knows?

[03:06:06.333 --> 03:06:06.653]  Listen.
[03:06:07.033 --> 03:06:11.036]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[03:06:11.296 --> 03:06:14.318]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[03:06:14.698 --> 03:06:17.520]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[03:06:17.741 --> 03:06:21.123]  They wanted me to go on Plavix but I refused knowing the negative side effects.

[03:07:01.215 --> 03:07:02.095]  Spring is here.
[03:07:02.355 --> 03:07:03.136]  Growing season.
[03:07:03.316 --> 03:07:05.296]  The economy is not getting any better.
[03:07:05.496 --> 03:07:06.896]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[03:07:07.217 --> 03:07:07.877]  Think about it.
[03:07:08.197 --> 03:07:12.038]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[03:07:12.278 --> 03:07:15.759]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.

[03:08:01.465 --> 03:08:06.511]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.872 --> 03:08:09.174]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:21.324 --> 03:08:26.767]  All right, Gerald Cilente is with us some more for the hour, and we're going to be taking some of your phone calls that have guests for Gerald.
[03:08:26.787 --> 03:08:41.596]  But I want to bring something up to Gerald here and then play that clip that we didn't finish of him in 2011 on the broadcast, a YouTube copy, a clip of the TV streams, where he was saying, get ready for the bank holiday.
[03:08:41.616 --> 03:08:45.058]  And he said the New York Times called him a pessimist porn dealer.
[03:08:46.119 --> 03:08:51.924]  I get called a fear porn person and it's not fear porn.
[03:08:52.004 --> 03:08:58.589]  If I'm driving down the street and I see my neighbor's house on fire, I'm gonna pull up and see if they're aware of it or I'm gonna call the fire department.
[03:08:59.648 --> 03:09:02.431]  I mean, admitting something's going on is a good thing.
[03:09:02.951 --> 03:09:03.972]  So we can stop it.
[03:09:04.492 --> 03:09:10.978]  And of course, I get attacked, Gerald gets attacked, other guests that we have on who actually tell the truth.
[03:09:11.599 --> 03:09:13.721]  We get attacked and it's important to defend us.
[03:09:13.781 --> 03:09:14.902]  I mean, Gerald doesn't care.
[03:09:15.322 --> 03:09:17.164]  But I mean, Gerald, you've been torn up pretty bad.
[03:09:17.184 --> 03:09:21.728]  You know, people say, oh, Gerald said seven years ago, you know, we'd have a collapse.
[03:09:21.788 --> 03:09:22.489]  It never happened.
[03:09:22.809 --> 03:09:23.410]  I mean, what do you call 2008?
[03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:25.351]  What do you call what's happening now?
[03:09:26.653 --> 03:09:29.117]  I mean, we could have total collapse, they'd say you were wrong.
[03:09:30.118 --> 03:09:35.927]  This lying, this stonewalling, do you want to respond to all the people that have been proven wrong and the fact that you've been right?
[03:09:36.854 --> 03:09:39.195]  Well, yeah, you know, my record speaks for itself.
[03:09:39.235 --> 03:09:40.655]  I'll put it up against anybody's.
[03:09:40.675 --> 03:09:42.376]  Do I get the timing right all the time?
[03:09:42.436 --> 03:09:42.656]  No.
[03:09:42.676 --> 03:09:43.737]  You know, you can't.
[03:09:43.837 --> 03:09:46.798]  And I always make it clear, no one could predict the future.
[03:09:46.818 --> 03:09:48.158]  There are too many wild cards.
[03:09:48.539 --> 03:09:56.302]  Do I know that the Federal Reserve is going to dump in $17 trillion into the system to bail it out?
[03:09:56.722 --> 03:10:04.925]  Do I know that they're going to kill capitalism with four words called too big to fail?
[03:10:05.405 --> 03:10:08.707]  Oh, and by the way, here's another one that I don't want to hear anymore.
[03:10:09.347 --> 03:10:18.172]  Yes, Mussolini did say, it's a fact, Jack, the merger of state and corporate powers is called fascism.
[03:10:18.532 --> 03:10:29.657]  So did I know that we would lose all our rights and we would let the Federal Reserve and the banking system con us with this continuing scam?
[03:10:30.018 --> 03:10:30.998]  I want to read something.
[03:10:31.038 --> 03:10:32.099]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[03:10:32.699 --> 03:10:39.494]  This isn't edited yet, but it's coming from the SpringTrends Journal, which will be out in about three or four weeks.
[03:10:41.926 --> 03:10:54.409]  As with all Ponzi schemes, the system is designed to collapse and the victims will be those who believe their governments were holding currencies that were being systematically debased.
[03:10:55.149 --> 03:10:56.689]  That's all this is.
[03:10:57.269 --> 03:11:01.510]  It's one big pump-and-dump Ponzi scheme.
[03:11:01.650 --> 03:11:03.951]  Let me put it to you this way, let me put it to you this way then.
[03:11:05.071 --> 03:11:07.873]  And correct me if I'm wrong, but I've studied history because it's so interesting.
[03:11:07.913 --> 03:11:13.197]  I've probably read 200, 300 history books to be conservative, and countless journals on the subject.
[03:11:13.417 --> 03:11:20.822]  Has there ever been a time that they've debased a currency that it hasn't finally hyperinflated or super hyperinflated?
[03:11:20.842 --> 03:11:27.487]  Because I don't know of any time the path we're on hasn't led straight to economic hell.
[03:11:28.211 --> 03:11:29.012]  It's going to.
[03:11:29.492 --> 03:11:32.995]  This is what is so unbelievable.
[03:11:33.015 --> 03:11:37.820]  A theme of this Trends Journal coming out is, I don't want to hear it.
[03:11:39.295 --> 03:11:40.396]  People don't want to hear it.
[03:11:40.736 --> 03:11:42.277]  They want to believe they're lying.
[03:11:42.657 --> 03:11:43.998]  They want to believe in their beliefs.
[03:11:44.018 --> 03:11:44.698]  But am I wrong?
[03:11:44.758 --> 03:11:46.700]  Hasn't this always led to collapse?
[03:11:47.060 --> 03:11:48.601]  Yes, it has to!
[03:11:48.881 --> 03:11:52.003]  You can't keep printing worthless money.
[03:11:52.483 --> 03:11:59.588]  You cannot keep... Look, the only reason this whole bond scam is going on is because of what the Federal Reserve is doing.
[03:11:59.608 --> 03:12:00.348]  It's in front of us.
[03:12:00.689 --> 03:12:02.210]  Look what's going on in China now.
[03:12:02.930 --> 03:12:05.452]  What they're doing now is they're afraid of inflation.
[03:12:05.492 --> 03:12:07.373]  Just went up 3.2 percent.
[03:12:07.433 --> 03:12:08.594]  It's much higher than that.
[03:12:08.934 --> 03:12:11.536]  They've been dumping money into the system in a different way.
[03:12:11.856 --> 03:12:14.758]  They've been building their infrastructure, but the result is the same.
[03:12:15.138 --> 03:12:18.600]  It has to... Look, I don't tell again people what to do.
[03:12:18.620 --> 03:12:18.660]  My...
[03:12:20.001 --> 03:12:23.405]  You know, we're taught to be by my dear father, may his soul rest in peace.
[03:12:23.705 --> 03:12:24.626]  Think for yourself.
[03:12:25.407 --> 03:12:26.469]  I buy gold.
[03:12:27.430 --> 03:12:28.591]  I buy silver.
[03:12:28.611 --> 03:12:31.554]  I buy it for my golden years.
[03:12:31.574 --> 03:12:34.297]  I am not a speculator.
[03:12:34.918 --> 03:12:41.663]  Why would I want to hold on to paper money that they just keep printing and printing?
[03:12:42.023 --> 03:12:52.771]  Oh, and going back to the other bigger game, China, Russia, Iran, they're all getting together to try to kill the petrodollar.
[03:12:53.151 --> 03:13:03.399]  Because once they stop trading oil with petrodollars, boy, you're going to see the dollar crash like you've never seen it crash before.
[03:13:03.519 --> 03:13:07.942]  And notice the EU and others are moving towards that SDR down the road.
[03:13:08.622 --> 03:13:10.983]  They are designing the destruction of society.
[03:13:11.343 --> 03:13:12.064]  So what do we do?
[03:13:12.084 --> 03:13:13.785]  Do we just beat the drum for their arrest?
[03:13:14.125 --> 03:13:15.786]  I mean, they've proven they're above the law.
[03:13:16.106 --> 03:13:17.987]  The Justice Department has said they're above the law.
[03:13:18.007 --> 03:13:21.449]  The Justice Department's busy staging Fast and Furious to get our guns.
[03:13:21.889 --> 03:13:24.291]  I mean, we really do just have a criminal takeover here.
[03:13:24.921 --> 03:13:25.221]  It is.
[03:13:25.301 --> 03:13:26.783]  It's a banking takeover.
[03:13:27.423 --> 03:13:34.349]  So again, you know, to meet gold and silver, how, why would any, you get, why would you want to hold this paper crap?
[03:13:34.749 --> 03:13:39.233]  They're debasing it in front of our, we got a six, you know, you're going to play those clips.
[03:13:39.513 --> 03:13:44.257]  When I met was on your show, the deficit was $15 trillion.
[03:13:44.578 --> 03:13:46.980]  It went up a trillion and a half since then.
[03:13:47.580 --> 03:13:52.223]  They're never going to solve this problem, this whole sequester stuff.
[03:13:52.463 --> 03:13:53.463]  What are they talking about?
[03:13:53.483 --> 03:13:55.084]  Eighty-something billion dollars?
[03:13:55.364 --> 03:13:58.286]  That's one month with the Fed is dumping into the system.
[03:13:58.866 --> 03:14:00.127]  They can't save it.
[03:14:00.207 --> 03:14:01.428]  It's impossible.
[03:14:02.288 --> 03:14:07.111]  I truly believe, Alex, they're going to debase the currency.
[03:14:07.851 --> 03:14:10.253]  And again, if you're living in Europe,
[03:14:11.175 --> 03:14:16.877]  Who would want to hold a euro when you see what's going on in front of your eyes?
[03:14:18.077 --> 03:14:19.878]  And the same thing in China.
[03:14:20.378 --> 03:14:22.819]  So you're going to see this thing to me.
[03:14:23.079 --> 03:14:25.920]  Will it collapse next week, next month, next year?
[03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:27.461]  I can't put a date on it.
[03:14:27.741 --> 03:14:38.145]  But only speaking for myself, why would I believe that by printing more money, by keeping interest rates near zero,
[03:14:39.165 --> 03:14:44.513]  When interest rates go back up, the bond market's going to collapse.
[03:14:44.813 --> 03:14:53.145]  And all those people that are saying when interest rates go up, it's going to be a sign because of a strong economy, grow up!
[03:14:54.110 --> 03:15:04.078]  We got to import our shirts, our shoes, we're importing, we import our oil, we import our cars, you name it.
[03:15:04.538 --> 03:15:08.061]  No, it's not going to recuperate because of a strong economy.
[03:15:08.081 --> 03:15:20.811]  It's been a plan, a long-term agenda, and they're going to clamp down with the police state, but we've been there warning people, so this isn't happening in a vacuum, so they're saying anybody that criticizes the Federal Reserve is the new terrorist.
[03:15:21.371 --> 03:15:26.933]  Which shows the foreign occupiers, the globalist occupiers, are saying those of us that are warning you are the bad guys.
[03:15:27.013 --> 03:15:28.294]  No, they're the bad guys.
[03:15:28.314 --> 03:15:34.136]  I want to finish that clip and then go to calls from you two years ago on the show talking about the holiday.
[03:15:34.196 --> 03:15:34.696]  Here it is.
[03:15:37.497 --> 03:15:39.358]  They were talking about declaring a bank holiday.
[03:15:39.718 --> 03:15:40.219]  That's right.
[03:15:40.559 --> 03:15:41.399]  This is June 2009.
[03:15:41.439 --> 03:15:44.300]  Biden's words are, as soon as we got sworn in,
[03:15:49.426 --> 03:15:58.452]  The first thing at the top of our list, we had the transition team there and 30 economists, was whether or not to call a bank holiday.
[03:15:59.152 --> 03:16:00.714]  This is no holiday, folks.
[03:16:01.214 --> 03:16:02.615]  You can't get your money!
[03:16:02.955 --> 03:16:04.876]  You think it's bad trying to get it now?
[03:16:05.196 --> 03:16:06.177]  You can't get any of it.
[03:16:06.497 --> 03:16:10.420]  And when you do get it, they'll do like they did the last time they called a bank holiday.
[03:16:10.880 --> 03:16:12.761]  They'll devalue the currency.
[03:16:13.482 --> 03:16:14.903]  So that's what we're warning.
[03:16:15.515 --> 03:16:17.356]  They've already said they were going to do it.
[03:16:17.556 --> 03:16:24.220]  Now remember, Alex, that happened before there was a European crisis.
[03:16:24.880 --> 03:16:31.223]  That happened before the United States was $15 trillion in debt.
[03:16:31.844 --> 03:16:43.090]  That happened before the Federal Reserve, when you add it all up, pumped in $26 trillion into the Ponzi scheme to keep it afloat.
[03:16:44.755 --> 03:16:45.976]  And here's the Winter Trends Journal 2010.
[03:16:46.956 --> 03:16:51.318]  I'll show it for TV viewers, but Top Trends Breaking Point 2010.
[03:16:52.258 --> 03:17:00.082]  And he talks about bank holidays, draconian measures, and taking part of your bank accounts, just taking money right out.
[03:17:00.422 --> 03:17:01.482]  And they call it a tax.
[03:17:01.502 --> 03:17:03.843]  They call it Obamacare, doubling your costs.
[03:17:03.863 --> 03:17:05.464]  We're going to skip this network break.
[03:17:05.484 --> 03:17:08.465]  This is our final long segment with Gerald Cilente.
[03:17:08.885 --> 03:17:12.327]  TrendsResearch.com, TrendsJournal.com, history before it happens.
[03:17:13.087 --> 03:17:14.188]  And he's on with us right now.
[03:17:14.248 --> 03:17:15.569]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:17:15.909 --> 03:17:21.413]  We're going to take some phone calls here right now for your questions in the 10 or 12 minutes we have left with Gerald.
[03:17:22.053 --> 03:17:23.915]  Let's talk to James in Missouri.
[03:17:23.935 --> 03:17:25.056]  You're on the air.
[03:17:25.096 --> 03:17:25.756]  Thanks for holding.
[03:17:26.817 --> 03:17:27.397]  Yeah, no problem.
[03:17:27.417 --> 03:17:28.118]  Thanks for having me.
[03:17:28.178 --> 03:17:41.307]  You know, I'm just getting kind of to the point now where I can't justify spending my energy, my life force towards anything except we're trying to express
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:43.722]  What is going on to other people?
[03:17:43.782 --> 03:17:46.585]  And I just don't, I just don't know, you know, how much more are we going to put up with?
[03:17:46.665 --> 03:17:49.008]  I mean, the general public is in a trance.
[03:17:49.048 --> 03:17:51.651]  We got to figure out how to get them out of their trance.
[03:17:52.752 --> 03:17:53.593]  Uh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:17:54.505 --> 03:17:55.005]  That's fine.
[03:17:55.105 --> 03:17:58.148]  But I mean, how much longer are we going to put up with this?
[03:17:58.208 --> 03:18:05.673]  I mean, we've got... Gerald's been talking about just the blatant, overt manipulation going on in our financial institutions.
[03:18:06.533 --> 03:18:14.259]  We were talking about earlier about the manipulation of the food, the manipulation of the water, the manipulation of everything.
[03:18:14.339 --> 03:18:16.660]  No, no, we're in a scientific dictatorship.
[03:18:16.680 --> 03:18:21.544]  That's why these guys are on such power trips, because they just manipulate us like we're dumb animals.
[03:18:22.444 --> 03:18:22.785]  Gerald?
[03:18:24.323 --> 03:18:25.444]  When was it going to change?
[03:18:25.524 --> 03:18:30.868]  Again, the model to me that exists is this five-star movement.
[03:18:31.368 --> 03:18:33.470]  It's not a protest, it's a movement.
[03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:37.293]  We have to get a movement going where we have conditions.
[03:18:37.673 --> 03:18:48.320]  For example, some of the conditions, and I'm speaking about this a lot now, all of these politicians start talking about our founding fathers when it's convenient for them.
[03:18:49.341 --> 03:18:51.523]  No more foreign entanglements.
[03:18:52.810 --> 03:18:53.990]  Founding fathers.
[03:18:54.471 --> 03:18:56.271]  No more central banks.
[03:18:56.711 --> 03:18:59.232]  We have to put together a movement.
[03:18:59.953 --> 03:19:05.775]  And I believe that between now and the next election is the time to do it.
[03:19:06.355 --> 03:19:11.377]  And when I studied the Five Star Movement in Italy, they only began that in 2008, 2009.
[03:19:14.998 --> 03:19:16.219]  And look what happened.
[03:19:16.599 --> 03:19:20.641]  That party got more votes than any other single party in Italy.
[03:19:21.061 --> 03:19:22.402]  There are enough of us.
[03:19:22.842 --> 03:19:28.525]  But we have to unite behind a movement, not a political party.
[03:19:28.945 --> 03:19:30.486]  And that's the big difference.
[03:19:30.926 --> 03:19:33.187]  We need to change the system.
[03:19:33.527 --> 03:19:39.410]  You cannot fix the Gambinos, the Bananos, the Democrats or the Republicans.
[03:19:41.132 --> 03:19:45.016]  And they know that we're going to try to get free of them, so they're arming their teeth against us.
[03:19:45.076 --> 03:19:50.381]  And police and military better be discussing this right now, and citizens better be very aggressive about what's happening.
[03:19:50.441 --> 03:19:57.087]  We have to make this the big cultural issue in our society right now.
[03:19:57.768 --> 03:20:03.210]  Yes, and just stay with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
[03:20:03.570 --> 03:20:04.811]  Just stay on these issues.
[03:20:05.151 --> 03:20:10.633]  You know, it came out today, big news, Hillary Clinton's for same-sex marriage.
[03:20:11.193 --> 03:20:12.994]  You know, what do I care what she's for?
[03:20:13.014 --> 03:20:17.255]  You know, is she coming out of the closet and gonna get rid of Bill?
[03:20:17.556 --> 03:20:18.836]  What the hell do I care about?
[03:20:18.856 --> 03:20:20.997]  I don't care about those issues.
[03:20:21.637 --> 03:20:22.578]  Those aren't the things.
[03:20:22.638 --> 03:20:23.158]  Exactly.
[03:20:23.199 --> 03:20:29.824]  The group's trying to say, you know, focus on it, that it's bad or distracting, and the people obsessing on it are saying it's great or distracting.
[03:20:30.044 --> 03:20:31.485]  They shove all this stuff.
[03:20:31.705 --> 03:20:35.888]  Well, is he gay or is she a lesbian or what's gonna go on with this?
[03:20:36.229 --> 03:20:40.232]  While they implode everything around us, they have us all fighting with each other.
[03:20:40.612 --> 03:20:41.213]  Exactly.
[03:20:41.293 --> 03:20:49.518]  So going back to the question, we need to have a movement that's based upon what this country was founded on.
[03:20:50.099 --> 03:20:55.323]  And every one of them said, do not become involved in foreign entanglements.
[03:20:55.803 --> 03:21:01.107]  Every one of them, except a few of the criminals in there, didn't want a central bank.
[03:21:01.907 --> 03:21:08.348]  Every one of them wanted to have our freedom of expression, the right to bear arms.
[03:21:09.048 --> 03:21:10.409]  Every one of them.
[03:21:10.789 --> 03:21:13.289]  It's a very simple process.
[03:21:13.829 --> 03:21:15.530]  It has to go back to the people.
[03:21:15.730 --> 03:21:19.191]  Oh, and do you know what the big one with Beppe Grillo is?
[03:21:19.511 --> 03:21:22.711]  The one I've been talking about for two years now.
[03:21:23.191 --> 03:21:24.692]  Direct democracy.
[03:21:25.412 --> 03:21:30.873]  He wants the people in Italy to vote whether or not they want to stay in the Euro.
[03:21:31.764 --> 03:21:33.105]  Let the people vote.
[03:21:33.426 --> 03:21:36.508]  We do not have a representative form of government.
[03:21:36.949 --> 03:21:39.551]  We have Feinsteins and Pelosi's.
[03:21:39.851 --> 03:21:42.373]  We have McConnell's and we have Boner's.
[03:21:42.774 --> 03:21:51.881]  We have a bunch of guys and women that only represent the most powerful and the most amount of money that they give to them.
[03:21:52.202 --> 03:21:58.067]  Look at Obama with this new, this new lobbying group that he put together.
[03:21:58.547 --> 03:22:09.871]  If you raise $500,000 or if you donate $500,000, you get to meet with El Presidente every four months.
[03:22:11.372 --> 03:22:15.493]  I mean, it's just open, open globalism, open mafia takeover.
[03:22:16.314 --> 03:22:17.034]  Thank you, James.
[03:22:17.054 --> 03:22:18.855]  Let's talk to Matthew in Maryland.
[03:22:18.875 --> 03:22:19.455]  You're on the air.
[03:22:19.475 --> 03:22:19.895]  Go ahead.
[03:22:19.915 --> 03:22:24.837]  Yeah, I just wanted to get a comment about the new Pope being
[03:22:25.495 --> 03:22:32.266]  Supposedly, after listening to Tarpley's analysis over the weekend, he's very anti-globalist.
[03:22:32.947 --> 03:22:37.434]  Wanted to know how you guys felt that's going to impact the economic outlook.
[03:22:38.151 --> 03:22:39.572]  That's not the way I read it.
[03:22:39.872 --> 03:22:56.044]  I read it, he's a member of the club, from a lot of the information that I've been reading, and there's a lot of spin going on, and one of the things was when they had that terrible time in Argentina, with all those missing people, 30,000 of them.
[03:22:56.064 --> 03:22:57.305]  He was helping out?
[03:23:00.721 --> 03:23:02.582]  Let's just say he was silent on it.
[03:23:03.282 --> 03:23:09.927]  And so, and you know, there's this other thing too, I'm Catholic, you know, the Jesuits were never going to be Pope.
[03:23:10.547 --> 03:23:21.955]  That was one of the things, and the Jesuits, by the way, it was only founded 1,500 years after Christ, so I don't think there's much of a connection in terms of the spirituality from the originator.
[03:23:22.215 --> 03:23:29.160]  But having said that, their doctrine was never to be a Pope or go into the hierarchy.
[03:23:29.620 --> 03:23:32.121]  So there's something here that doesn't sit right with me.
[03:23:32.441 --> 03:23:42.826]  As a matter of fact, the chief Jesuit spokesman just before the coronation of the Pope, the election of the Pope, said it would never happen that he would be chosen.
[03:23:43.126 --> 03:23:47.748]  That's how out of the... Yeah, notice on every level ancient taboos are being broken.
[03:23:48.188 --> 03:23:51.570]  Yeah, so I don't see anything coming out of that.
[03:23:52.390 --> 03:23:53.370]  Alright, there you go.
[03:23:53.710 --> 03:23:54.571]  Matthew, anything else?
[03:23:56.190 --> 03:23:57.291]  Uh, no, that's it.
[03:23:57.351 --> 03:24:01.092]  But I guess it's curious that he's going out into the crowds now, though, too.
[03:24:01.152 --> 03:24:02.293]  He's very fearless.
[03:24:02.753 --> 03:24:03.374]  You know what?
[03:24:03.414 --> 03:24:05.495]  You know, that's what they're supposed to do.
[03:24:05.795 --> 03:24:08.416]  It's like they made a big deal about Mother Teresa.
[03:24:08.856 --> 03:24:11.037]  They're all supposed to be Mother Teresas.
[03:24:11.397 --> 03:24:13.018]  This is what they're supposed to do.
[03:24:13.518 --> 03:24:16.700]  And they get one or two to do it, and they make a big deal about it.
[03:24:17.260 --> 03:24:19.061]  They're all supposed to be with the poor.
[03:24:19.301 --> 03:24:22.222]  They're all supposed to be working with the people all the time.
[03:24:22.763 --> 03:24:25.064]  So no, this to me is a publicity stunt.
[03:24:26.095 --> 03:24:27.099]  All right, thank you, Matthew.
[03:24:27.180 --> 03:24:28.485]  Let's talk to Bill in Florida.
[03:24:28.525 --> 03:24:29.991]  Bill, you're on the air with Gerald Solente.
[03:24:30.011 --> 03:24:30.292]  Go ahead.
[03:24:31.451 --> 03:24:32.211]  Hello, gentlemen.
[03:24:32.251 --> 03:24:33.452]  God bless the both of you.
[03:24:33.492 --> 03:24:34.172]  You're awesome.
[03:24:34.352 --> 03:24:35.393]  Thank you.
[03:24:36.173 --> 03:24:43.476]  I'm a big ex-Marine and I've just been investing my money in physical gold and silver.
[03:24:43.536 --> 03:24:45.297]  Been doing it for almost a year now.
[03:24:45.317 --> 03:24:52.380]  Now I sold a property ready to sell more and I'm thinking of a storage vault somewhere.
[03:24:52.420 --> 03:24:54.001]  I was looking at gold money.
[03:24:54.481 --> 03:25:00.064]  Does Gerald have an opinion on that or where to store, you know, a big amount?
[03:25:00.822 --> 03:25:08.105]  For an investment without it being safe, which in this day and age... Well, they go after safe deposit boxes now.
[03:25:08.125 --> 03:25:09.265]  I mean, it's really crazy.
[03:25:10.626 --> 03:25:11.526]  I agree with Alex.
[03:25:11.566 --> 03:25:13.607]  That's the one place I would not put it in.
[03:25:14.127 --> 03:25:16.147]  I would say use your imagination.
[03:25:16.668 --> 03:25:17.468]  You're a Marine.
[03:25:17.488 --> 03:25:18.268]  You've been out there.
[03:25:18.288 --> 03:25:19.429]  You know what life looks like.
[03:25:19.449 --> 03:25:20.209]  And pack some heat.
[03:25:21.297 --> 03:25:23.699]  And you know, just use your own head.
[03:25:24.959 --> 03:25:34.525]  But again, you know, when they confiscated gold back in the 1930s, your safety deposit box wasn't so safe.
[03:25:34.645 --> 03:25:43.891]  And right now, of course, they know all your information, everything about you, and if they close down the banks, they close down your deposit box.
[03:25:43.931 --> 03:25:46.153]  I would just say, you know, use your head.
[03:25:46.213 --> 03:25:47.454]  Yeah, what do the old-timers do?
[03:25:48.394 --> 03:25:50.976]  What did Long John Silvers do?
[03:25:51.417 --> 03:25:54.619]  Yeah, you know, you have some property, bury it somewhere.
[03:25:54.639 --> 03:25:56.341]  You know, don't tell anybody.
[03:25:56.361 --> 03:25:57.942]  Bury it with Billy Bones.
[03:25:58.102 --> 03:25:59.183]  Thank you for the call, Bill.
[03:26:00.164 --> 03:26:03.287]  Let's talk to Hoot in South Carolina.
[03:26:03.307 --> 03:26:04.207]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:26:04.227 --> 03:26:06.089]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:07.130]  Pretty good, sir, go ahead.
[03:26:07.150 --> 03:26:10.613]  I got a little insider tip.
[03:26:10.673 --> 03:26:15.777]  I was actually at a prominent restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia, and had a few drinks with some gentlemen.
[03:26:15.797 --> 03:26:16.598]  They were from Europe.
[03:26:17.253 --> 03:26:17.573]  Yes, we are.
[03:26:36.369 --> 03:26:38.511]  And, you know, first of all, like, why would they do that?
[03:26:38.571 --> 03:26:45.777]  They've done such a great job of not having it backed by gold and of destroying that since the 1970s.
[03:26:45.797 --> 03:26:50.582]  So why would they all of a sudden convert to having the currency backed by gold again?
[03:26:50.602 --> 03:26:54.105]  And if so, then when do they plan on doing this?
[03:26:54.185 --> 03:26:55.186]  What would that play out as?
[03:26:56.102 --> 03:26:57.183]  That's a great question.
[03:26:57.863 --> 03:27:09.211]  I think it was 2010, the head of the World Bank back then, Zoellick, he came out with this concept about having gold as one of the parts of the banking of a new reserve currency.
[03:27:09.431 --> 03:27:10.491]  Yeah, 10 to 30 percent.
[03:27:11.332 --> 03:27:13.854]  And I think that that's a reality.
[03:27:14.334 --> 03:27:16.115]  I think that's something that could happen.
[03:27:16.135 --> 03:27:19.497]  Because the next time everything implodes, no one's going to trust fiat anymore.
[03:27:19.897 --> 03:27:20.458]  That's right.
[03:27:20.498 --> 03:27:23.240]  So if they have some gold behind it, now think about it.
[03:27:24.119 --> 03:27:28.807]  If they have to put gold as part of the backing of a new reserve currency?
[03:27:29.673 --> 03:27:31.975]  You think gold prices are going to be high?
[03:27:32.656 --> 03:27:33.276]  Absolutely.
[03:27:33.296 --> 03:27:42.304]  Because they got a lot of dough out there, and they got a lot of backing to do, so you could see gold prices go up to like $11,000 an ounce.
[03:27:42.924 --> 03:27:45.787]  Well, if you look at 12-, 13-year graphs, gold just keeps going up.
[03:27:45.827 --> 03:27:47.968]  People look at one-year graphs or six-month graphs.
[03:27:48.009 --> 03:27:48.969]  Look at a 12-month graph.
[03:27:48.989 --> 03:27:50.310]  That's why I'm in gold and silver.
[03:27:50.891 --> 03:27:54.114]  In closing, Gerald, have you noticed the media is trying to create race division?
[03:27:54.614 --> 03:28:08.963]  And trying to act like libertarianism is a white thing, and Southern Poverty Law Center reports about people that think the New World Order is taking over, or megabanks, they're white Christians, and it makes no sense to people that are researched, but it's meant to create division.
[03:28:09.803 --> 03:28:10.604]  What do you make of that?
[03:28:11.360 --> 03:28:12.961]  Well, look at this last election.
[03:28:13.021 --> 03:28:15.262]  You can see the division it created.
[03:28:15.882 --> 03:28:18.843]  And you were talking about the food stamps for Mexicans.
[03:28:19.523 --> 03:28:20.624]  I mean, who do they vote for?
[03:28:20.724 --> 03:28:21.704]  They go Democratic.
[03:28:22.324 --> 03:28:30.828]  So yeah, they use divisiveness all the time, whether it's between the people in the states or among the different nations.
[03:28:31.508 --> 03:28:35.950]  So fear and hysteria, hate and deception, that's what they do.
[03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:38.052]  And of course they're doing.
[03:28:38.252 --> 03:28:39.133]  It's elementary.
[03:28:39.173 --> 03:28:48.223]  Shut down the economy, transfer everybody on to food stamps, and then things go more bankrupt, take more money from the middle class, and pretty soon there's no middle class.
[03:28:48.563 --> 03:28:49.725]  I mean, it's so horrible.
[03:28:50.506 --> 03:29:11.065]  Well, one of the reasons why you're not seeing this Great Depression that we're in, when you look at John Williams' shadow stats, and like they came out with the new employment numbers last month, 236,000 jobs or something like that created, but hardly anybody mentioned the 139,000 that dropped out.
[03:29:11.585 --> 03:29:14.708]  The only reason you don't see the bread lines is because of the food stamps.
[03:29:14.848 --> 03:29:16.230]  Digital food lines, yeah.
[03:29:16.750 --> 03:29:17.391]  Exactly.
[03:29:17.491 --> 03:29:23.197]  So if you didn't have those food stamps going on, then you would really see the horrors that are being created.
[03:29:23.217 --> 03:29:26.281]  You'd have 50 million homeless people in bread lines.
[03:29:27.921 --> 03:29:30.322]  47 million on food stamps, isn't there?
[03:29:30.342 --> 03:29:30.962]  Almost 50 million.
[03:29:30.982 --> 03:29:33.883]  It's almost 50 million now, yeah, and that's not even counting some state progress.
[03:29:33.903 --> 03:29:40.785]  So could you imagine 50 million people online for food, outside, like they used to do during the Great Depression?
[03:29:40.805 --> 03:29:43.386]  There would be riots in the streets!
[03:29:43.446 --> 03:29:43.906]  You're right.
