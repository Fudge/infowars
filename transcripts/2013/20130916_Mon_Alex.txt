[00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:05.392]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:07.492]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:15.535]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:17.236]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:19.077]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:20.537]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:22.238]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:26.479]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.101]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:39.374]  Four killed, eight injured.
[00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:42.795]  There were three shooters, now we're told there's two.
[00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:52.818]  At the big naval yard in Washington, D.C., where no one is allowed to have firearms to protect themselves.
[00:00:54.418 --> 00:00:58.039]  Notice almost all of these mass shootings happen in victim disarmament zones.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.301]  Now, my gut will tell me this will probably end up being a couple of, quote, jihadis.
[00:01:06.052 --> 00:01:16.098]  But even if they are jihadis, they will somehow go through their home computers, and if they find them visiting ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, that won't be on the news.
[00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:26.324]  If they get into their computers or their iPhones or whatever, they're reportedly both been shot and killed, but who knows, those stories are changing by the minute.
[00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.252]  Today we'll be able to flesh a lot of this out.
[00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:36.239]  But you better believe that even if they're just pure jihadis that did this...
[00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:48.923]  Even connected to Al Qaeda groups out of the Middle East being commanded by the leader of Al Qaeda last Friday to attack the United States.
[00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:49.803]  Remember that?
[00:01:49.823 --> 00:01:51.524]  The very same group our government's arming.
[00:01:52.084 --> 00:02:01.009]  Even if that's the case, you can believe, like the last three or four cases, they're going to try to connect it to InfoWars.com
[00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.555]  And yours truly, part of that long-term demonization campaign.
[00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:22.610]  If you want to wonder how big this radio show is, even separate from the website, it's the fact that they try to pin... I'd say about half the major crimes, we get brought into it.
[00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.773]  You had Poplowski shoot three cops in Pittsburgh a few years ago.
[00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:30.006]  The Marine, and they said he did it because he was one of my listeners.
[00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:30.946]  Turned out he hated me.
[00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:34.288]  He was a white supremacist that didn't like the fact that I wasn't a racist.
[00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.831]  Within two hours of him being in custody, his mother was trying to throw him out of the house.
[00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:39.891]  That's why he shot the cops.
[00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:40.892]  He was drunk.
[00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:45.435]  They were blaming me on the news for it, nationally.
[00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:47.616]  Now, why is that?
[00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:50.477]  It's because we've got their number.
[00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:51.798]  We know who the globalists are.
[00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:52.959]  We know what their program is.
[00:02:53.732 --> 00:03:03.054]  And they're very concerned that we be discredited so that people will not look at what we cover on the radio show, the InfoWars Nightly News, and on the websites.
[00:03:03.874 --> 00:03:09.035]  Which, by the way, we're working on revamping to the latest, easiest web design.
[00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:11.236]  That's all ongoing right now.
[00:03:12.376 --> 00:03:15.277]  So, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:17.997]  Four killed, eight injured.
[00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:21.898]  The Washington Post and others are saying three shooters now, too.
[00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:32.954]  AP saying at least one shooter is dead, and now CNN's reporting two suspects down, one dead, one down.
[00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:38.655]  I would suspect that means dead or close to it, in the Naval Yard shooting.
[00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:49.278]  Oh, but don't worry, the same team that responded to the Boston bombing, because that undoubtedly was a false flag up one side and down the other, they are there to make sure the truth comes out.
[00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:54.167]  The Russians have staged mass shootings before to take liberty.
[00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:56.809]  Clear evidence in Pristina and other areas.
[00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.873]  The Nazis staged mass shootings in Operation Himmler as a pretext to take liberties.
[00:04:03.413 --> 00:04:09.317]  Operation Northwoods, put out by the Pentagon, was how to stage mass shootings and frame it on Patsy's.
[00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:15.761]  When you have multiple shooters like this, it has Patsy written all over it.
[00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:19.364]  And how they tend to do it is, in the modern ages, have a drill,
[00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:22.589]  Have people that show up for the drill.
[00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.372]  You then shoot them in the corridors or wherever you tell them to meet the feds for the drill.
[00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:32.713]  They shoot them.
[00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:37.354]  Then the feds go out with a mask or the contractors shoot some people.
[00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.559]  Folks said they were bad shots.
[00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.720]  Well, they were probably just told to only kill a few people, but create a big ruckus.
[00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:50.621]  This is how you would stage a false flag, and then you go back and are part of the FBI team.
[00:04:50.862 --> 00:04:52.722]  They said responded minutes after.
[00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:56.083]  Really, but it took three hours for this to start winding down.
[00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.323]  It started at, what, 720 Eastern?
[00:04:59.284 --> 00:05:03.004]  Just now starting to wind down at noon Eastern?
[00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.345]  That's like four or five hours.
[00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:09.086]  We're going to break it all down straight ahead and take phone calls from the area.
[00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:13.388]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:19.653]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[00:05:19.993 --> 00:05:26.378]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:05:26.798 --> 00:05:28.739]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.120]  They're the good guys.

[00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:14.535]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:17.616]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:23.019]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.021]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.601]  We are what we eat.
[00:06:26.902 --> 00:06:31.244]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:06:31.584 --> 00:06:35.567]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:06:35.807 --> 00:06:38.068]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:06:38.348 --> 00:06:44.273]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:33.652]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:35.573]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:40.515]  It is Monday, the 16th day of September, 2013.
[00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:54.421]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and obviously we are going to be breaking down the Naval Yard shooting that's reportedly killed four, injured eight,
[00:08:55.655 --> 00:09:01.377]  Including two police officers that are amongst the injured.
[00:09:01.397 --> 00:09:05.198]  And it looks like one of them is probably a fatality.
[00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:11.881]  And both shooters are reportedly down, one of them reportedly dead.
[00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:14.962]  We don't know if that's part of the list of killed.
[00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:32.209]  Reportedly, the shooters were firing from balconies down into a cafeteria area, and we have one of the witnesses we're going to play a clip of in a moment saying that she was told by cafeteria staff to stay there.
[00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:34.190]  You're supposed to get in a fetal position.
[00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:35.691]  Your children are trained.
[00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:39.794]  If anybody ever comes up into an area shooting people, you don't run.
[00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:46.119]  You get in a fetal position to get the maximum kill rate so that the government can then take everybody's guns.
[00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:49.466]  You're trained to not fight back when a bully punches you.
[00:09:50.106 --> 00:09:52.707]  You're trained to never resist.
[00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:57.528]  You're trained by the criminal state to submit and be a victim.
[00:09:57.689 --> 00:10:00.269]  And no one can doubt that that is the case.
[00:10:00.289 --> 00:10:04.851]  In fact, let's play a clip of that from one of the press conferences.
[00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:11.507]  After paying for my breakfast, I heard three gunshots.
[00:10:12.287 --> 00:10:17.349]  About three seconds later, there were four more gunshots and all the people there were in the cafeteria.
[00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:22.112]  We all panicked and he was trying to decide on which way we were going to run out.
[00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:27.474]  The people, the workers in the cafeteria wanted us to stand and hide, but I just ran.
[00:10:28.274 --> 00:10:30.976]  That's right, and they told, they told,
[00:10:35.925 --> 00:10:42.530]  The 3,000 people there reportedly over loudspeakers to shelter in place.
[00:10:45.092 --> 00:10:56.981]  And of course, we're doing another article on what came out earlier in the year, the Homeland Security training video, where it tells you to shelter in place and fight back with scissors or your shoe.
[00:10:59.344 --> 00:11:22.655]  But all over the country for at least 15 years, as you know, they have training in government facilities, corporations, but mainly government training centers, government indoctrination centers, public education centers, that you get down on your knees or in a fetal position so that I guess it's easier for the shooter to kill everybody.
[00:11:25.657 --> 00:11:27.418]  That'd be like training someone that
[00:11:28.576 --> 00:11:41.383]  If you're walking down the street and somebody tells you to get in the car, just go ahead and go get in the car with them, because then everything is going to be all right.
[00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:49.928]  Totally disgusting to see all of this unfolding.
[00:11:49.948 --> 00:11:57.793]  I just wanted to remind everybody here today that you have a better chance to die from a honeybee sting than to
[00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:04.323]  be killed in a terror attack period including mass shootings.
[00:12:04.403 --> 00:12:11.466]  There's only about 64 of them a year and less than 25 of them are actual real mass shooting events.
[00:12:11.947 --> 00:12:18.590]  That was the statistics from the Justice Department indexed over the last decade that we've covered at nauseam.
[00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:25.493]  And since 1992 through 2011, where we get the latest statistics, here's the LA Times.
[00:12:27.077 --> 00:12:29.119]  Mirroring what we reported months before.
[00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:32.601]  And my point is, we forced these statistics out.
[00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:33.922]  We actually broke them down here.
[00:12:34.823 --> 00:12:37.425]  That overall mass shootings the last 20 years have dropped 49%.
[00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:42.429]  Total shootings have dropped 49%.
[00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:44.830]  Mass shootings, it was 60-something percent.
[00:12:45.351 --> 00:12:46.772]  And overall crime, more than 50%.
[00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:51.355]  And here's the LA Times this year breaking that down.
[00:12:51.735 --> 00:12:55.618]  Gun crime has plunged, but Americans think it's up, study says.
[00:12:56.599 --> 00:12:58.881]  That is out of the Los Angeles Times.
[00:12:58.941 --> 00:13:01.664]  And tonight on the Nightly News, I'm going to be co-hosting it.
[00:13:02.004 --> 00:13:03.986]  We're going to go over all those statistics.
[00:13:04.006 --> 00:13:06.549]  We'll cover some of them here today as well.
[00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:16.118]  But don't take my word for it, but the perception everywhere is that crime is absolutely exploding.
[00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:16.838]  And why is that?
[00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:17.939]  You had one 19-year-old man
[00:13:20.814 --> 00:13:33.603]  Hiding out in a boat in Boston and they shut more than half the city down and treated everyone as suspects who looked nothing like him and went in people's houses and beat people up in a giant orgy of power grabbing.
[00:13:36.425 --> 00:13:37.706]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:13:38.647 --> 00:13:41.669]  Scores of helicopters, dozens of armored vehicles.
[00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:47.533]  It started at 7.20 in the morning and just started wrapping up about 15 minutes ago.
[00:13:47.633 --> 00:13:48.554]  Both shooters down.
[00:13:49.830 --> 00:14:04.575]  At about 11.58 Eastern, 10.58 Central, just about 15, 16 minutes ago, they said, OK, this is kind of wrapping it up.
[00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:09.537]  Still, people are told to shelter in place, which means sit and wait and prepare to die.
[00:14:12.158 --> 00:14:12.778]  Unbelievable.
[00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:16.259]  Unbelievable that all of this is going on.
[00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:18.240]  And you see how good
[00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:24.482]  I guess security guards with guns are, when there's just a few of them instead of everybody being armed.
[00:14:25.463 --> 00:14:32.668]  One of the shooters reportedly walked up and shot a cop at point-blank range was the first person shot.
[00:14:32.728 --> 00:14:35.110]  Now, none of this is completely confirmed yet, obviously.
[00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.111]  It's all a fluid situation right now.
[00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:38.192]  Here's what I want to do.
[00:14:38.492 --> 00:14:41.955]  There were reportedly 3,000 people in the Naval Yard alone.
[00:14:44.022 --> 00:14:50.946]  When they've had other mass shootings at universities that were ongoing, we've been able to have callers in first to tell us what was happening.
[00:14:50.966 --> 00:15:03.394]  But now that this situation is over, or at least looks like it's ending, I would like to hear from eyewitnesses to what you personally saw or heard at the Naval Yard there in Washington, D.C.
[00:15:04.895 --> 00:15:12.539]  In the victim disarmament zone, crime capital, twin crime capital of the world, not just the United States, D.C.,
[00:15:14.992 --> 00:15:21.334]  And Chicago are well known to be the twin crime capitals of the planet.
[00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:23.655]  Worse than Mexico City per capita.
[00:15:25.035 --> 00:15:27.856]  Now, Mexico has the highest crime rate in the world overall.
[00:15:28.537 --> 00:15:30.297]  And of course, citizens aren't allowed to have guns.
[00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:31.077]  Period.
[00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.438]  It's only criminals and government.
[00:15:32.718 --> 00:15:33.258]  Same thing.
[00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:35.299]  Two peas in a pod, have them.
[00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:43.182]  But for cities, Chicago, the great city, the windy city, and DC,
[00:15:44.963 --> 00:15:47.964]  Both have the twin peaks.
[00:15:51.766 --> 00:15:54.126]  One has the record one year, the other has the record the next year.
[00:15:55.227 --> 00:15:56.027]  And that's it.
[00:15:57.308 --> 00:16:08.852]  And so, again, a place where you've got all of these Navy personnel and civilian personnel and longshoremen and
[00:16:10.885 --> 00:16:23.518]  The different civilian, maritime groups, merchant marine that make up so much of the military's transport fleet.
[00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:33.568]  You've got them all there, none of them allowed to have guns, except a few federal security guards, police officers, but they call them security guards, in there to be shot.
[00:16:35.512 --> 00:16:49.984]  When, I guarantee you, if you tried this, let's say, in a neighborhood in South Austin, not even a particularly libertarian or conservative city, if you had a mass shooter going down the street shooting people, he would be dead in minutes.
[00:16:51.024 --> 00:16:51.945]  And it happens all the time.
[00:16:52.486 --> 00:16:56.088]  You've got somebody pulls a gun out and starts shooting people and folks kill him.
[00:16:56.529 --> 00:17:03.634]  Every month I see articles in Arizona or Texas or other states that have a lot of guns where people are shooting at cops.
[00:17:04.574 --> 00:17:09.157]  In a standoff situation and citizens shoot the bad guys from behind.
[00:17:09.538 --> 00:17:12.800]  You'll have a bad guy behind a tree or behind a truck shooting at cops.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.981]  You got cops over here shooting.
[00:17:14.521 --> 00:17:15.742]  Citizens just open their window.
[00:17:16.042 --> 00:17:16.402]  Boom!
[00:17:17.283 --> 00:17:18.204]  One shot, you're dead.
[00:17:18.264 --> 00:17:19.665]  I mean, it happens all the time.
[00:17:20.085 --> 00:17:21.246]  It's in the local news.
[00:17:21.646 --> 00:17:26.790]  And then you'll hear headlines like, Grand Jury Does Not Indict Citizen Hero.
[00:17:28.052 --> 00:17:32.476]  And the police will have to go to the prosecutors and say, oh, don't, no, no, no.
[00:17:32.857 --> 00:17:35.719]  I know they were involved in the shooting, but they helped us, please don't.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:47.450]  Nowadays, they would have arrested the citizen, the janitor, who went up the tower, the UT tower, with the Austin cop who I've interviewed.
[00:17:48.611 --> 00:17:51.074]  And by the way, the citizen got the first shot off with a shotgun.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.624]  Charged him first and killed the Marine with the rifles.
[00:17:58.225 --> 00:18:08.895]  Nowadays they probably would have, I'm not kidding, they would probably have arrested the civilian, as they call them, or the cop wouldn't have let a civilian go up the tower with him.
[00:18:09.596 --> 00:18:14.361]  Because that's an American, that's an enemy, that's a fellow slave that's armed.
[00:18:16.275 --> 00:18:22.582]  And it's not that cops themselves are bad on average, it's the training now is that a citizen with a gun is the ultimate evil.
[00:18:23.223 --> 00:18:35.778]  When in truth, ladies and gentlemen, the truth is more guns means less crime and there is a 50 plus percent overall drop
[00:18:38.997 --> 00:18:47.083]  In shootings period, 49% drop in other types of shootings and 60 plus percent overall drop in violent crime.
[00:18:47.663 --> 00:18:54.949]  And you can go look at those statistics one by one in the InfoWars.com articles and videos we've done that I'm going to have from earlier this year and last year.
[00:18:56.226 --> 00:19:00.249]  with Sandy Hook reposted to an article at Infowars.com.
[00:19:00.609 --> 00:19:04.272]  But you can just type in, gun crime has plunged, but Americans think it's up.
[00:19:04.712 --> 00:19:05.453]  Study says.
[00:19:05.473 --> 00:19:18.823]  And then they go in to say that actually some gun crime dropped 75% is what the LA Times says.
[00:19:19.403 --> 00:19:20.925]  Again, it depends on how you look at it.
[00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:22.746]  We try to be conservative, okay?
[00:19:23.707 --> 00:19:23.887]  But
[00:19:25.302 --> 00:19:32.947]  The whole point here is, yeah it says 75 right there, but really it's 49 if you want to be most conservative.
[00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:34.368]  It's 49.
[00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.631]  Sure, some of it's as high as 75.
[00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.132]  So there you go.
[00:19:41.363 --> 00:19:42.403]  Now that's the big issue.
[00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:47.565]  Now when we come back, could this be a false flag is the $64 trillion question.
[00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:53.626]  Four victims killed, eight injured in a shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, at least two shooters down.
[00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:57.688]  That sounds like terrorism, so of course they're saying it's not terrorism.
[00:19:58.168 --> 00:20:02.709]  You got multiple shooters, that's not somebody going postal, which you might see at a naval yard.
[00:20:02.729 --> 00:20:03.329]  800-259-9231.
[00:20:03.389 --> 00:20:03.829]  Were you there?
[00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:05.010]  Did you have family there?
[00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:05.070]  800-259-9231.
[00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:14.818]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:20:14.979 --> 00:20:17.943]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:20:18.104 --> 00:20:23.332]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:20:23.672 --> 00:20:25.275]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:20:25.575 --> 00:20:26.916]  We are what we eat.
[00:20:27.216 --> 00:20:31.560]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.863]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:38.425]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:44.590]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:22:09.639 --> 00:22:18.884]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:18.944 --> 00:22:19.684]  This capitalism?
[00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:25.848]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:25.908 --> 00:22:29.550]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:22:43.117 --> 00:22:46.359]  You need a secret bunker, and you need it deep and strong.

[00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:06.310]  Atlas Survival Shelters.
[00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.651]  Better prepared than scared.
[00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:14.134]  We travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.
[00:23:14.275 --> 00:23:17.397]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[00:23:17.797 --> 00:23:23.781]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:35.849]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:40.532]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[00:23:40.732 --> 00:23:42.293]  And they're so easy to use.
[00:23:42.533 --> 00:23:44.434]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[00:23:44.454 --> 00:23:48.176]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:51.598]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with pre-shipping.
[00:23:51.998 --> 00:23:54.960]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[00:23:58.942 --> 00:23:59.782]  That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.
[00:23:59.802 --> 00:24:00.783]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[00:24:27.688 --> 00:24:34.675]  Folks, I would like to hear from listeners that may have been inside of the giant complex naval yard that one building had as many as 3,000
[00:24:49.497 --> 00:24:58.904]  Workers in a huge shipyard facility just a few miles away from the occupied capital there in DC.
[00:24:59.444 --> 00:25:06.329]  They're reporting the main shooter suspect shot and being down, being reportedly a black man.
[00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:19.202]  And then reportedly a Caucasian, a white male in some type of khaki uniform with a khaki beret, that sounds like some kind of US military uniform, running around with a handgun.
[00:25:20.183 --> 00:25:28.192]  But you can have a lot of false reports too, because if any other citizen sees someone with a gun, you're not supposed to have a gun unless you're in a black uniform.
[00:25:29.193 --> 00:25:38.320]  Slaves aren't allowed to have guns, so everyone's been Pavlovianly trained that you only see men in black uniforms, black ski masks, checkpoints.
[00:25:38.761 --> 00:25:41.443]  That makes you feel safe, like Nazi Germany.
[00:25:42.203 --> 00:25:43.244]  That keeps you safe.
[00:25:44.485 --> 00:25:54.713]  If somebody in the military happened to sneak a gun on the base, which is not uncommon to be able to protect themselves, then that would be accounting for the other shooters.
[00:25:55.114 --> 00:25:56.335]  Or it may be another shooter.
[00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:18.673]  Or it may have been somebody taking part in a drill, and the way you'd run a false flag, and we don't know if this is a false flag, the way you run a false flag, one way you do it is to have shooters there who think they're part of a drill, then you kill them, and then have your real shooters just basically change out of whatever outfit they were in, and then into another.
[00:26:19.881 --> 00:26:36.431]  And then you divert everyone from the implosion of the narrative on Syria, the implosion with the Benghazi report coming out, all the NSA news pouring out of the illegal spying and government lying, the IRS caught lying about targeting Tea Party conservatives and others.
[00:26:37.912 --> 00:26:45.877]  You've got all the other scandals, so this is a great way to change the subject because any way you slice this, ladies and gentlemen, any way you look at this,
[00:26:48.015 --> 00:26:52.140]  When you have one of these mass shootings, it's like the world has ended.
[00:26:54.482 --> 00:26:59.167]  We had six people burned up today in a trailer while the mom was at work.
[00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:01.530]  Associated Press.
[00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.373]  We have 1,200 missing.
[00:27:04.753 --> 00:27:06.856]  There could be hundreds of dead in Colorado.
[00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:08.677]  You wouldn't even think that mattered.
[00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:12.180]  Maybe we should have a TSA checkpoint to stop the water.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.181]  Or TSA could feel up the water to make sure Bin Laden isn't hiding in it.
[00:27:17.201 --> 00:27:21.442]  Because Bin Laden could be swimming with aqua tanks, you know, in the floods.
[00:27:21.542 --> 00:27:25.983]  I mean, we've got to all give up our liberty because, you know, honeybees kill 200-plus people a year.
[00:27:26.383 --> 00:27:27.964]  Mass shootings, 60-something.
[00:27:28.884 --> 00:27:29.604]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:27:29.984 --> 00:27:35.846]  And most of that gang related, we've all got to give our rights up because it's so scary.
[00:27:37.281 --> 00:27:39.282]  This is all an exercise in mind control.
[00:27:39.903 --> 00:27:45.946]  LA Times broke down the Justice Department report of local crime statistics released this year.
[00:27:45.966 --> 00:27:49.668]  And they said a 75% drop in shootings.
[00:27:50.609 --> 00:27:52.290]  The way we broke it down is 49%.
[00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.411]  There's different ways to look at it.
[00:27:55.451 --> 00:27:57.232]  The point is, more guns, less crime.
[00:27:58.253 --> 00:28:01.375]  Areas that have high gun ownership, almost no home invasions.
[00:28:01.695 --> 00:28:04.837]  Areas where there is no gun ownership, it's hell on earth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:06.943 --> 00:28:08.126]  And they've got the D.C.
[00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:14.578]  police chief who's violated federal and state law and won't let citizens be armed, and they arrest people that have toy bullets.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.322]  And give them felony charges.
[00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:20.464]  You know, disarmed, empty shell casings.
[00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:32.175]  And she's literally on TV giving a press conference right now in some type of beyond third world general outfit that looks like something from a Judge Dredd cartoon in the 1970s.
[00:28:32.475 --> 00:28:36.880]  I mean, she's got stars on her arm bigger than quarters on her shoulders.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.362]  Absolutely clown-like.
[00:28:41.494 --> 00:28:48.598]  And they have hundreds and hundreds of deaths a year of disarmed slaves in DC, but you'll never hear about that.
[00:28:48.959 --> 00:28:50.880]  And it's just unbelievable grandstanding.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:58.204]  When they had the other police commander speaking that's behind her, if you're watching us on TV, she was acting like she was crying.
[00:28:58.624 --> 00:29:01.646]  Probably crying with glee that she'll be able to go out for the Second Amendment.
[00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:04.828]  By the way, Obama gave a speech last night.
[00:29:05.248 --> 00:29:06.469]  This is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:09.136 --> 00:29:27.656]  Obama gave a speech last night, it aired on national television, where he rolled out new gun control measures and he lied and said that 80-90% of Americans want new gun restrictions passed when all the polls showed the opposite.
[00:29:28.777 --> 00:29:30.840]  Just like he said no one believes the rebels.
[00:29:33.126 --> 00:29:34.306]  May have used the chemical weapons.
[00:29:34.326 --> 00:29:35.807]  She said no one on earth believes that.
[00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:38.028]  In the same interview with Snuffinophilus.
[00:29:38.588 --> 00:29:42.049]  When we come back, I want to talk to witnesses or people that have worked on the base.
[00:29:42.069 --> 00:29:42.469]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:42.529]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:42.589 --> 00:29:43.550]  Or people in D.C.
[00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.490]  period that saw any unusual activity.
[00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.690]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.991]  We're going to come back and go to your phone calls straight ahead.
[00:29:59.557 --> 00:30:02.539]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.262]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.865 --> 00:30:12.967]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:30:13.267 --> 00:30:20.553]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:30:20.993 --> 00:30:25.656]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:30:25.916 --> 00:30:27.818]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:30:28.078 --> 00:30:34.202]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:30:34.482 --> 00:30:42.306]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[00:30:42.707 --> 00:30:49.030]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.351]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[00:31:10.595 --> 00:31:15.496]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:31:16.096 --> 00:31:19.357]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:31:19.917 --> 00:31:22.798]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:31:23.338 --> 00:31:26.158]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:32.820]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.841]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:48.191]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:31:48.892 --> 00:31:53.897]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:31:54.398 --> 00:31:59.823]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,
[00:32:00.103 --> 00:32:02.269]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[00:33:27.056 --> 00:33:28.317]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:28.917 --> 00:33:30.078]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:30.538 --> 00:33:31.519]  You want answers?
[00:33:32.099 --> 00:33:33.240]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:41.025]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:41.565 --> 00:33:44.467]  Hey, you White House!
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.121]  We're living science fiction, my friends.
[00:33:48.982 --> 00:34:08.996]  And boy, today is a heavy news day of incredibly important information that we haven't even covered yet on the NSA front, on the economic front, on a typhoon, a huge one set to hit the Fukushima reactor facility that's already in danger of having new total meltdowns.
[00:34:09.736 --> 00:34:13.119]  A very serious situation on that front.
[00:34:14.687 --> 00:34:18.409]  We've got Congress coming out saying that Hillary basically covered up on Benghazi.
[00:34:19.229 --> 00:34:21.330]  Yeah, that's pretty obvious right there.
[00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.291]  We have news up on Infowars.com.
[00:34:24.811 --> 00:34:25.872]  Navy Yard shooting.
[00:34:25.912 --> 00:34:27.893]  Did gun-free zone enable killers?
[00:34:29.272 --> 00:34:30.694]  Again, did the sun come up this morning?
[00:34:30.754 --> 00:34:32.575]  Very important article to expose that.
[00:34:33.036 --> 00:34:39.262]  Mass shooting follows Obama's latest anti-Second Amendment push, just right on time.
[00:34:39.302 --> 00:34:40.503]  He launched a new one last night.
[00:34:41.044 --> 00:34:44.307]  Breaking four dead in mass shooting at Nabel Yard.
[00:34:45.308 --> 00:34:47.109]  Confusion over number of gunmen.
[00:34:47.129 --> 00:34:50.591]  Paul Watson's big article that he's updating continually.
[00:34:51.352 --> 00:34:54.773]  Former NSA director advocates Chinese style internet.
[00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:56.354]  That is a big deal.
[00:34:56.474 --> 00:34:59.976]  Linked up on DrudgeReport.com at the bottom of the middle column.
[00:35:01.317 --> 00:35:04.159]  Obamacare will question your sex life.
[00:35:04.199 --> 00:35:05.840]  We told you this was always going to happen.
[00:35:06.618 --> 00:35:13.022]  Just like in Europe and Australia, you're going to tell them everything about your sexual life or you're not going to get the health care.
[00:35:13.322 --> 00:35:16.705]  Doesn't matter if it violates the whole Bill of Rights, Constitution, common sense.
[00:35:18.126 --> 00:35:28.993]  And the man who modeled the NSA after the bridge of the Starship Enterprise is now in command of the Information Dominance Center.
[00:35:29.013 --> 00:35:31.274]  It's all about dominating and controlling.
[00:35:31.595 --> 00:35:35.838]  Larry Summers has announced he's pulling out right now.
[00:35:37.058 --> 00:36:04.870]  from being the head of the private Federal Reserve because of the fact that he's really the main author if you've got to pick one person he's more guilty than anybody of getting rid of Glass-Steagall and engineering the fraud that we've seen unfolding with the too big to fail and the derivatives that is all coming up as well today and some shootings you didn't hear about so much
[00:36:06.724 --> 00:36:08.885]  Some shootings that didn't get a lot of attention.
[00:36:09.285 --> 00:36:16.429]  Remember last year when we heard a shooter shot nine people in New York City by the Empire State Building?
[00:36:16.909 --> 00:36:23.493]  Turned out one guy pulled a gun out and shot another hot dog vendor over fighting over space.
[00:36:24.864 --> 00:36:32.454]  It was a business dispute going postal and then the police pulled their guns out and shot at least nine people.
[00:36:32.474 --> 00:36:38.822]  It was actually more than 15 that got small bullet fragments in them, but nine people that they reported had been shot.
[00:36:39.162 --> 00:36:41.145]  Then it came out a week later.
[00:36:42.146 --> 00:36:49.749]  In the back of the paper, here's Mike Adams' article from naturalnews.com up on infowars.com.
[00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:55.452]  NYPD cops accidentally use innocent bystanders for target practice again.
[00:36:55.472 --> 00:37:07.237]  Then I thought I would flash back, there's ABC News reporting it, two bystanders struck by NYPD cops opening fire on suspect near Times Square.
[00:37:07.537 --> 00:37:09.538]  It was a man pulling out his key swipe.
[00:37:10.752 --> 00:37:11.574]  He's Keyswipe.
[00:37:11.594 --> 00:37:15.603]  The guy got shot at locally in Austin for having a wallet in his hand a few weeks ago, too.
[00:37:16.004 --> 00:37:17.006]  I say execute everyone.
[00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:18.249]  It's the only way the government can be safe.
[00:37:19.131 --> 00:37:19.732]  NYPD 9.
[00:37:21.714 --> 00:37:24.858]  Shot nine bystanders, again with police gunfire.
[00:37:24.878 --> 00:37:31.565]  I thought I had a flashback to that to talk about, you know, just the fact that when the state's shooting people, it's not a big deal.
[00:37:31.605 --> 00:37:41.335]  But when they can say it's a citizen and, oh, they say he had an AR-15, an M-16, an M-4 type variant, an assault rifle, we've got to ban those.
[00:37:42.756 --> 00:37:56.459]  Well, I have Kit Daniels doing an article right now that should be out in the next hour at InfoWars.com with the statistics that one of the least used guns in crime or in killing people in the United States is the M4.
[00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:02.440]  Now, the media is literally salivating over what type of gun it was, like it did it.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.621]  So if they can demonize that, oh see, it's the one!
[00:38:07.475 --> 00:38:13.096]  Copycats will then only start using that exclusively in mass shootings to create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:38:13.116 --> 00:38:14.436]  That's how advertisement works.
[00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:17.197]  Gillette, the best a man can get.
[00:38:18.337 --> 00:38:22.938]  And the men all run out and get those because they believe that's the best a man can get, then it becomes the most popular.
[00:38:22.998 --> 00:38:25.118]  Or they show you Kerr's commercials.
[00:38:26.159 --> 00:38:28.339]  I saw one last night in a restaurant I was sitting in.
[00:38:30.019 --> 00:38:33.260]  And if you drink Kerr's, suddenly all of these
[00:38:34.602 --> 00:38:38.784]  Beauty Queen women run out the door to go home and have sex with you at your house immediately.
[00:38:39.865 --> 00:38:42.106]  Now that's not really what happens when you drink Kers.
[00:38:42.467 --> 00:38:43.387]  You get a potbelly.
[00:38:43.707 --> 00:38:47.570]  Nothing against Adolf Kers and Anheuser-Busch and all the rest of them.
[00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:51.952]  That's why Dos Equis made the joke of the most interesting man in the world.
[00:38:52.172 --> 00:38:54.554]  You know, when that first came out years ago, I thought it was real.
[00:38:55.543 --> 00:39:00.305]  The first time I saw it because people are so cheesy and acting cool is what people are into.
[00:39:00.665 --> 00:39:02.566]  I thought, my goodness, they've gone over the top.
[00:39:02.926 --> 00:39:04.547]  How ridiculously cheesy.
[00:39:04.947 --> 00:39:14.451]  I want to stop drinking Dos Equis that I've been drinking since I'd, you know, take some from my dad when I was 10 years old and go out and drink with my buddies on the golf course or whatever.
[00:39:15.351 --> 00:39:17.332]  Yeah, I'm pretty horrible, folks.
[00:39:17.853 --> 00:39:20.934]  Come on, who didn't run off with a beer or two when you were 10 years old?
[00:39:22.248 --> 00:39:27.633]  And who didn't like steal grandpa's cigarettes and go out and smoke them behind the barn and throw up?
[00:39:28.314 --> 00:39:29.895]  Alright, I'm digressing.
[00:39:30.255 --> 00:39:31.136]  A serious issue.
[00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:32.357]  Were you a witness?
[00:39:32.417 --> 00:39:33.698]  Are you in the area?
[00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:34.879]  Or have you worked there?
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.081]  What's your take on it if you're in the D.C.
[00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:37.482]  area?
[00:39:37.822 --> 00:39:41.225]  Specifically, though, on the Naval yard, on the Naval base?
[00:39:41.605 --> 00:39:42.646]  We'd like to hear from you.
[00:39:42.666 --> 00:39:42.706]  800-259-9231.
[00:39:50.503 --> 00:39:52.104]  And we're going to continue to break all this down.
[00:39:52.124 --> 00:39:57.445]  But before I go to your calls, one final little tidbit, then we'll play Obama's comments that we just taped.
[00:39:57.825 --> 00:40:00.366]  He's wrapping the grandstanding up right now.
[00:40:00.806 --> 00:40:05.648]  I wish he'd have a press conference for the tens of thousands of Christians killed by Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:40:07.009 --> 00:40:09.029]  Their heads chopped off, their churches burned down.
[00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:10.610]  Oh, I'm sorry, he's funding them.
[00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:11.950]  And who else is he funding?
[00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.651]  Remember this story from Friday?
[00:40:14.605 --> 00:40:15.126]  I don't think so.
[00:40:29.401 --> 00:40:38.207]  Al Zahari urged small-scale attacks inside the United States to bleed America economically, adding he hoped eventually to see a more significant strike.
[00:40:38.907 --> 00:40:41.629]  But he called for smaller mass shooting type events.
[00:40:41.709 --> 00:40:43.791]  And what have I been saying the last three weeks?
[00:40:43.871 --> 00:40:45.492]  I said I'm looking for false flags.
[00:40:45.952 --> 00:40:47.293]  I'm looking for mass shootings.
[00:40:47.934 --> 00:40:50.635]  We don't even have the crew to go back and pull me saying that.
[00:40:50.695 --> 00:40:51.176]  Probably
[00:40:52.824 --> 00:40:53.685]  Let's be conservative.
[00:40:54.065 --> 00:41:01.031]  Twenty times the last three weeks, maybe listeners can go back to the audio feed, the podcast, and find it, put it on YouTube.
[00:41:01.972 --> 00:41:06.956]  Listeners called in and said that's what they thought would happen, so they can also demonize the Second Amendment.
[00:41:07.216 --> 00:41:09.157]  And get this, even if these shooters
[00:41:09.858 --> 00:41:13.759]  Because they're now saying they think there are one dead guy and two other suspects.
[00:41:13.819 --> 00:41:14.840]  That's just now breaking.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.540]  We'll never hear of the truth.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:22.663]  Because the very same group that ran the Boston bombing cover-up, they admit the Boston bombing experts are there.
[00:41:23.203 --> 00:41:29.265]  Imagine if these guys, these patsies or whoever they are, would have gotten out of the naval base, the naval yard.
[00:41:30.862 --> 00:41:32.103]  They would have shut down all of D.C.
[00:41:32.183 --> 00:41:37.345]  In fact, they've stopped air traffic at Reagan Airport out of fear.
[00:41:38.106 --> 00:41:40.187]  They've shut down and locked down all the D.C.
[00:41:40.227 --> 00:41:40.687]  schools.
[00:41:42.908 --> 00:41:46.030]  This is absolutely ridiculous.
[00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:55.955]  This is absolutely out of control that you can have four dead people, you've got thousands missing in
[00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:26.449]  Colorado from the flood, you've got people dying in gas main explosions all over the country, you've got kids burning up six at a time inside their house, you've got people dying today with deer jumping out in front of them, wasps stinging them, you've got all these hundreds of thousands of deaths on the highways a year, but you'd think the world had ended with the media, and people in national studies, I just covered it on the LA Times, they believe that mass shootings are way up even though they're down.
[00:42:27.756 --> 00:42:28.136]  The L.A.
[00:42:28.156 --> 00:42:29.197]  Times says 75%.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.924]  Our numbers are overall shootings down 49% since 1992.
[00:42:37.404 --> 00:42:39.646]  And everybody who thinks about that knows that.
[00:42:39.966 --> 00:42:41.828]  Does your house get robbed less than it used to?
[00:42:41.848 --> 00:42:44.530]  Do you hear about less shootings in your area than you used to?
[00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:54.358]  Yeah, if you don't live in L.A., New York, D.C., Washington, D.C., or a few other areas, you have lower crime rates.
[00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:56.320]  If you don't live in Laredo,
[00:42:57.537 --> 00:42:59.458]  Then you've got lower crime rates than you used to.
[00:42:59.478 --> 00:43:04.562]  I mean, I remember growing up in Dallas, our house got robbed like once a year, and we were in a good neighborhood.
[00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:08.184]  You'd go out to the movies with your parents, come home, everything's stolen.
[00:43:09.125 --> 00:43:11.847]  I remember growing up in Rockwall, our house got stolen quite a few times.
[00:43:11.867 --> 00:43:14.509]  We lived in a nice, lakeside golf course community.
[00:43:14.529 --> 00:43:17.151]  I mean, it was just... But now, criminals are afraid.
[00:43:17.351 --> 00:43:20.573]  I remember carjackings almost every day growing up, in the noose.
[00:43:21.073 --> 00:43:23.395]  As soon as Concealed Carry came in, it all stopped, because
[00:43:24.955 --> 00:43:28.161]  Oh, it's like Russian Roulette if I try to carjack that car?
[00:43:30.245 --> 00:43:34.373]  You don't hear about women getting grabbed when they're jogging anymore unless you're talking about Central Park.
[00:43:37.861 --> 00:43:41.944]  And then the police are scared if it's a gang of 20-30 guys raping a woman in front of them.
[00:43:42.585 --> 00:43:44.466]  It's so sick, folks.
[00:43:45.186 --> 00:43:51.931]  We've got a bunch of grandstanding cowards in government who stood down for hours while these shootings were going on.
[00:43:52.192 --> 00:44:00.198]  And that's perfect that they make you stand down because the real cops can't discover whatever really happened while they make up the official story inside.
[00:44:00.798 --> 00:44:03.880]  And we've got Anthony in Florida who worked at the Naval Base for two years.
[00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:05.822]  We've got Sean, U.S.
[00:44:05.882 --> 00:44:08.004]  Army Special Agent, input on shooting.
[00:44:08.784 --> 00:44:15.970]  We don't have anybody on the naval yard that has reportedly tens of thousands of people in it, 3,000 in that complex alone.
[00:44:16.411 --> 00:44:19.393]  Here's the number again, 800-259-9231.
[00:44:20.214 --> 00:44:25.958]  I'd like to hear from you specifically about what you think happened.
[00:44:25.978 --> 00:44:30.622]  My gut told me Islamic terrorists today, just like the Fort Hood shooting.
[00:44:31.082 --> 00:44:32.584]  When you get the head of Al-Qaeda,
[00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:35.121]  Who's a known globalist double agent.
[00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:40.682]  With his al-Nusra that he heads up, running the main attacks in Syria.
[00:44:41.222 --> 00:44:46.863]  He's got a debt to Obama to play the part of the bad guy, to activate sleeper cells he's got.
[00:44:47.123 --> 00:44:49.384]  Again, the sleeper cells don't know they work for the globalists.
[00:44:49.924 --> 00:45:01.306]  Just like the Fort Hood shooter for two years, the psychiatrist, on record, was in communication with Ayman al-Zahrari,
[00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:15.048]  And of course, other leaders of Al-Qaeda in emails and phone calls and they've declared national security and will not release that and declared it non-terror related because they, in that trial, that was not a terrorism trial in Fort Hood.
[00:45:15.368 --> 00:45:16.168]  Was it 13 dead?
[00:45:17.749 --> 00:45:21.190]  And of course that's terrorism because folks, it was their guy.
[00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.491]  They allowed that to happen to create the fear.
[00:45:24.951 --> 00:45:25.571]  CIA.
[00:45:26.532 --> 00:45:26.932]  On record.
[00:45:27.796 --> 00:45:28.856]  Was running that whole deal.
[00:45:29.597 --> 00:45:30.177]  Elements of it.
[00:45:30.917 --> 00:45:33.678]  And so he says, attack with low intensity attacks.
[00:45:34.038 --> 00:45:35.298]  Start going after Americans.
[00:45:35.538 --> 00:45:39.439]  And we said last week, hey, I bet they'd start having mass shootings in America.
[00:45:40.039 --> 00:45:43.280]  So they can then go after the guns at the same time and divert away from all this.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.981]  It's not hard to figure this stuff out.
[00:45:47.561 --> 00:45:49.262]  All you do is put yourself in their mind.
[00:45:49.362 --> 00:45:50.802]  And then later, here's Al Jazeera.
[00:45:50.862 --> 00:45:52.523]  Al Qaeda leader urges attacks on U.S.
[00:45:52.563 --> 00:45:52.903]  soil.
[00:45:54.203 --> 00:45:55.084]  Bleed America.
[00:45:56.244 --> 00:45:56.504]  Boom.
[00:45:57.844 --> 00:45:59.207]  Now, here's the problem.
[00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:04.140]  The Boston bombing they tried to blame on Patriot groups until we blew that wide open.
[00:46:04.821 --> 00:46:05.202]  On record.
[00:46:06.192 --> 00:46:07.393]  Taking over their press conferences.
[00:46:07.413 --> 00:46:10.255]  Remember they said, oh, the announcement will be made later this afternoon.
[00:46:10.355 --> 00:46:11.696]  It is a Tea Party type right winger.
[00:46:11.716 --> 00:46:12.137]  Remember that?
[00:46:12.857 --> 00:46:18.001]  And then all of a sudden, folks, the photos got out there of all the Saudi Arabians and the other people.
[00:46:18.441 --> 00:46:22.144]  So they shifted to Plan B. They always do that with people we know.
[00:46:22.264 --> 00:46:29.090]  The older brother was on State Department CIA payroll with fake names as a double agent, bare minimum.
[00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:30.571]  And there was a drill and a stand down.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:37.524]  They want to go with the mass shootings and bombings to really get everybody ready for the takeover.
[00:46:38.264 --> 00:46:43.328]  Just like the drill we got in Austin that they said was actually real for a terror attack last month.
[00:46:44.149 --> 00:46:44.850]  We broke that.
[00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:49.974]  That was later confirmed to be a real alert they put out, but then they said, oh, don't worry, it's not a real threat now.
[00:46:50.555 --> 00:46:51.495]  But it is a real alert.
[00:46:52.496 --> 00:46:54.238]  All of it's there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:54.798 --> 00:46:55.519]  All of it's there.
[00:46:56.638 --> 00:47:03.320]  And it's essential when these events happen, this could be the first of many, that you videotape and you get on record what happened.
[00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:11.803]  Because regardless of who's behind it, who stands to gain, who will use it and fearmonger with it for their agenda to disarm the American people.
[00:47:13.244 --> 00:47:15.404]  Let's go to Anthony in Florida and then Sean and others.
[00:47:15.424 --> 00:47:16.205]  You're on the air, Anthony.
[00:47:16.225 --> 00:47:17.185]  Thank you for calling in today.
[00:47:17.205 --> 00:47:19.086]  How's it going, Alex?
[00:47:19.126 --> 00:47:21.266]  First off, I just want to thank you for everything you do.
[00:47:21.786 --> 00:47:22.887]  I really appreciate it down here.
[00:47:22.907 --> 00:47:25.068]  Appreciate you.
[00:47:25.088 --> 00:47:25.788]  Second off, I was
[00:47:27.063 --> 00:47:27.683]  We're good to go.
[00:47:52.363 --> 00:47:58.482]  Um, but like I said, a lot of people have multiple family members who work in the building, and a lot of people weren't at work today.
[00:48:00.506 --> 00:48:01.407]  Do me a favor.
[00:48:01.607 --> 00:48:17.276]  Well, we know on 9-11 the media called it a rumor, but it turns out, and then spun it into Israelis not being in the towers, what was really said was Arab kids in New York Daily News, you name it, said those towers won't be there next week to their classes.
[00:48:17.817 --> 00:48:19.618]  And there was even a police investigation.
[00:48:20.098 --> 00:48:29.364]  So the media, rather than focus on that, spun it and said people say no Jews died, when it was the media saying that themselves to change the subject.
[00:48:30.769 --> 00:48:36.832]  And it turned out that the buildings were about half empty from what they would normally be at that building's occupancy.
[00:48:37.453 --> 00:48:49.239]  The buildings were already about a third empty because of problems in asbestos, but for the tenants that were there, about half the people that day didn't go to work, and it turned out people did get warnings not to go across the board.
[00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:58.893]  Uh, and so, retweet or tweet at Real Alex Jones, uh, examples and screenshots of what you're seeing on Facebook.
[00:48:59.473 --> 00:49:03.115]  I'm gonna call Watson, uh, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, I'll tell my other crew.
[00:49:03.696 --> 00:49:04.817]  We will look into the fact.
[00:49:04.877 --> 00:49:10.480]  You're saying that it seems to be trending, that people are saying there was a lot of folks not there today?
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.702]  Multiple members of the same family.
[00:49:14.023 --> 00:49:17.285]  Like, not imitating them, but I'm just saying, it's pretty awkward that
[00:49:18.095 --> 00:49:21.798]  Multiple people worked in the building and were told to stay home.
[00:49:22.258 --> 00:49:23.399]  I don't know if they were told to stay home.
[00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:24.219]  For some reason they weren't.
[00:49:24.239 --> 00:49:30.784]  Well, I was about to say, a facility that's got over 10,000 people at it, you're going to have a lot of people that are not going to work today, especially in government work.
[00:49:31.184 --> 00:49:37.809]  But if anybody says those people need to be questioned immediately, why didn't you go to work?
[00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:43.673]  And if they say we were told, don't come in, there's going to be a drill next week, boy, you know, right there.
[00:49:43.813 --> 00:49:44.454]  I mean, that is
[00:49:45.543 --> 00:49:45.883]  Well, he, uh...
[00:50:10.646 --> 00:50:28.135]  The Department of Defense, President Bush in 2004 signed the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act that authorized all retired or separated or active police officers to carry a firearm in all 50 states with reciprocity with every state.
[00:50:29.095 --> 00:50:39.601]  The Department of Defense Officer Inspector General in 2007 rendered an opinion that only civilian special agents were covered by the law
[00:50:40.471 --> 00:50:50.199]  I'll tell you what, this is key.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.401]  I remember this when this controversy happened.
[00:50:53.342 --> 00:50:57.065]  Again, making the military bases sitting ducks, just like the Fort Hood shooting.
[00:50:57.966 --> 00:51:00.268]  Which if I remember correctly, that's why they got that through.
[00:51:00.408 --> 00:51:00.808]  Stay there.
[00:51:00.848 --> 00:51:01.929]  I'm going to come back to you.
[00:51:01.949 --> 00:51:04.672]  Or that was one reason cited.
[00:51:04.992 --> 00:51:05.813]  I want to hear about this.
[00:51:06.153 --> 00:51:08.395]  This is a story we should do tonight on the Nightly News.
[00:51:10.748 --> 00:51:12.089]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[00:51:12.289 --> 00:51:16.431]  The NSA and FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[00:51:16.832 --> 00:51:23.315]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[00:51:23.736 --> 00:51:27.318]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:29.839]  Fortunately, there is something you can do about it.

[00:52:09.625 --> 00:52:12.686]  A healthy digestive system supports a healthy immune system.
[00:52:13.526 --> 00:52:17.167]  And a healthy immune system protects you against infections and disease.

[00:53:12.168 --> 00:53:19.452]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:53:19.892 --> 00:53:24.535]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:53:24.815 --> 00:53:26.716]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:53:27.056 --> 00:53:33.120]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:41.205]  The new Just in Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.

[00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:24.057]  There's a man going around taking names.
[00:54:25.606 --> 00:54:30.167]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:54:30.187 --> 00:54:34.588]  CNN is reporting, quote, that they've never heard of any such thing happening before.
[00:54:35.208 --> 00:54:36.308]  Forgetting Fort Hood.
[00:54:36.348 --> 00:54:37.449]  That's from Mediaite.
[00:54:37.489 --> 00:54:40.209]  We're going to get that video clip and play it here on air.
[00:54:40.729 --> 00:54:45.110]  We are continually updating all the latest news at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:48.031]  Paul Joseph Watson is updating the breaking.
[00:54:48.631 --> 00:54:50.091]  They're now saying six dead.
[00:54:50.751 --> 00:54:51.752]  Actually, we've got to update it again.
[00:54:51.772 --> 00:54:52.992]  They're now saying seven dead.
[00:54:53.672 --> 00:54:59.295]  At the Washington Post, in mass shooting at Naval Yard, two gunmen still at large.
[00:55:00.316 --> 00:55:03.538]  That is continually updated up on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:04.018 --> 00:55:13.384]  Navy Yard shooting related to Al Qaeda's call for attacks, that's the question that we're asking in an article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:13.844 --> 00:55:17.086]  Navy Yard shooting right on time, gun control advocates blame
[00:55:17.626 --> 00:55:20.450]  AR-15, that just broke at Infowars.com.
[00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:24.475]  Navy Yard shelter-in-place order leaves victims sitting ducks.
[00:55:25.796 --> 00:55:28.440]  Navy Yard shooting did gun-free zones enable killer.
[00:55:31.385 --> 00:55:36.048]  Mass shooting follows Obama's latest anti-Second Amendment push.
[00:55:36.448 --> 00:55:43.052]  We need everybody to get these articles and get these out now because Obama just gave a speech and they're coming after the guns.
[00:55:43.792 --> 00:55:50.816]  And Obama went on television yesterday saying we gotta go after the guns and that 80 plus percent of Americans want to basically turn them in.
[00:55:52.117 --> 00:55:52.578]  It's on.
[00:55:53.618 --> 00:55:54.639]  And, I mean, come on.
[00:55:55.559 --> 00:55:58.341]  My gut tells me we're never going to learn the truth of this.
[00:55:59.221 --> 00:55:59.482]  Okay?
[00:56:00.427 --> 00:56:02.428]  And that they're getting ready to blame patriots.
[00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:08.572]  Now, they may say it's Muslim extremists that did it, but then connect that to patriots, even if it doesn't make sense.
[00:56:09.012 --> 00:56:17.897]  MSNBC has no proof that the Boston bombing patsies are connected to me or the Tea Party, but they said the Tea Party and Alex Jones made them do it.
[00:56:18.437 --> 00:56:19.438]  I could totally sue them.
[00:56:21.339 --> 00:56:24.401]  These are propaganda's folks that tell you polar bears can't swim.
[00:56:25.336 --> 00:56:28.137]  These are propagandists that say the Earth's getting hotter when it's getting cooler.
[00:56:28.698 --> 00:56:30.758]  These are propagandists who are known liars.
[00:56:30.899 --> 00:56:38.202]  Obama got on TV and said 80% of Americans wanted his gun bills, when all the polls showed almost 70% against it.
[00:56:38.482 --> 00:56:40.023]  See, he flips reality.
[00:56:40.083 --> 00:56:40.923]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:56:43.184 --> 00:56:54.614]  I remember when this happened, where they passed that law that any retired police officer or military person, great idea, could continue to have firearms.
[00:56:54.854 --> 00:56:56.415]  It's like your real National Guard.
[00:56:57.316 --> 00:57:02.020]  And then the military moved, I think it was the head of the Army, wasn't it?
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:02.420]  I forget.
[00:57:02.841 --> 00:57:05.743]  Give me notes on this so I can look it up and do a story on it.
[00:57:06.524 --> 00:57:08.866]  That they then continued to make military bases.
[00:57:10.106 --> 00:57:13.448]  These victim disarmament shooting spree zones.
[00:57:14.869 --> 00:57:18.111]  Repeat what you said before the break.
[00:57:19.071 --> 00:57:36.180]  In 2013, Senator Leahy and Senator Webb attached a rider to the Defense Authorization Act, making it very clear that all retired military law enforcement officers and special agents were covered under the intent of the law and forced DOD to accept that.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:48.425]  But to date they have not issued any retired credentials to any former or retired CID Special Agents and CIS CID Agents.
[00:57:48.585 --> 00:57:49.946]  And that's like D.C.
[00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:50.506]  D.C.
[00:57:50.546 --> 00:57:52.767]  has not followed Heller for five years.
[00:57:52.827 --> 00:57:58.850]  So give me the name of the act again that was signed under Bush so I can go look it up.
[00:57:59.599 --> 00:58:17.425]  It was the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act and the 2010 Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act Improvement Act and then the Defense Authorization Act of 2013 are the three acts that have created that authority and amended that authority throughout the last decade or so.
[00:58:18.186 --> 00:58:18.806]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:58:18.846 --> 00:58:20.727]  And again, folks, the NDA was massive.
[00:58:20.747 --> 00:58:21.608]  That's just one part of it.
[00:58:21.648 --> 00:58:23.108]  The bad part's the indefinite detention.
[00:58:23.509 --> 00:58:24.729]  That's a good part right there.
[00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:28.851]  So, uh, the Law Enforcement Safety Act of 2010.
[00:58:29.932 --> 00:58:32.993]  I thought that was under Bush that happened.
[00:58:34.314 --> 00:58:36.415]  The original act was in 2004 under Bush.
[00:58:36.555 --> 00:58:37.115]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:58:37.175 --> 00:58:37.555]  Okay.
[00:58:38.235 --> 00:58:38.916]  Yeah, okay.
[00:58:39.016 --> 00:58:39.556]  Exactly.
[00:58:39.976 --> 00:58:44.658]  And so now, watch, they won't let you be armed when the answer is arm the people on the base.
[00:58:44.719 --> 00:58:45.359]  Anything else, sir?
[00:58:47.443 --> 00:58:47.823]  Stay there.
[00:58:47.883 --> 00:58:48.564]  Back in one minute.

[01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:05.015]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:08.245]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.847 --> 01:00:19.009]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:19.669 --> 01:00:20.489]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.269 --> 01:00:22.210]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:26.411]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.992 --> 01:00:31.073]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:50.214]  We're getting some more information from our Justice Department and from our sources on the ground about what actually is transpiring inside the Navy Yard at this time.
[01:00:50.254 --> 01:01:00.083]  And what we understand is that the same team that helped pull Zohar Zarnaya from the boat in Boston when there was a great concern about additional explosives
[01:01:00.843 --> 01:01:03.845]  And what was actually going to transpire in the city of Boston.
[01:01:03.865 --> 01:01:07.768]  That same team is on the ground in the Navy Yard, and so they're really not taking anything off the table.
[01:01:08.148 --> 01:01:18.576]  We may have this report that one shooter is dead, but a question about whether or not there's still a risk to the area, that's obviously something that law enforcement is not taking very lightly and continuing to work on.
[01:01:18.596 --> 01:01:21.198]  You know folks, this gives new meaning to the word drama queen.
[01:01:22.118 --> 01:01:24.000]  When it comes out with a Fort Hood shooter,
[01:01:25.233 --> 01:01:31.995]  They're not allowed to call it terrorism, even though he was under the command of Al-Qaeda in hundreds of emails and phone calls.
[01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:33.816]  And who was he under the command of?
[01:01:34.796 --> 01:01:47.140]  He was under the command of the main Syrian rebel group, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who urged more small-scale attacks, including mass shootings, in the U.S.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:47.680]  last week.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.161]  And that's who our government's funding and arming.
[01:01:50.761 --> 01:01:52.741]  Going back to Sean, who's U.S.
[01:01:52.801 --> 01:01:53.822]  Army Special Agent,
[01:01:54.622 --> 01:02:00.909]  That's like the guys you see that are leading Private Manning around.
[01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.851]  What's his name now?
[01:02:02.911 --> 01:02:03.912]  It's not Bradley Manning.
[01:02:03.972 --> 01:02:05.854]  It's Chelsea Manning around.
[01:02:05.874 --> 01:02:07.616]  That's what he wants to be called.
[01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:14.203]  And yeah, once they retire, they're not allowed to carry guns outside of their home state anymore.
[01:02:15.089 --> 01:02:19.772]  Just like they disarmed the pilots, most of them didn't do it because of red tape, right before 9-11.
[01:02:19.832 --> 01:02:23.055]  You're going to trust them to fly an airplane, but you're not going to trust them to have a gun?
[01:02:23.075 --> 01:02:26.897]  I mean, an airplane's like 100,000, a million times?
[01:02:27.378 --> 01:02:34.623]  I mean, what's the mass of an airplane going 600 miles an hour versus the grain of a .50 caliber bullet?
[01:02:35.203 --> 01:02:37.185]  I mean, it's got to be a million times bigger or something?
[01:02:39.311 --> 01:02:40.012]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:02:40.092 --> 01:02:42.334]  It is absolutely insane.
[01:02:42.814 --> 01:02:47.899]  We can only trust TSA agents that go take a week-long course to stick their hands down our pants.
[01:02:48.519 --> 01:02:52.603]  But finishing up, Sean, you're going to make one other point about this, then we'll go to Robert, John, and others.
[01:02:53.844 --> 01:03:06.354]  Okay, what you're saying is absolutely correct, that if we had these folks carrying their weapons on military bases, they would be able to respond instantaneously to a threat.
[01:03:07.882 --> 01:03:24.574]  The local installation commanders can make the installation a gun-free zone even to FBI, CIA, NCIS, or any other federal agent that would otherwise have authority to carry a firearm on that installation.
[01:03:25.155 --> 01:03:35.923]  And to top it off, the installation, the local command authority decides whether or not military policemen perform their patrol duties with loaded guns or
[01:03:36.924 --> 01:03:42.925]  A weapon that has a magazine loaded, but not the chamber, or if the magazine is in their pouch.
[01:03:43.446 --> 01:03:50.707]  And these people are doing patrol duties and responding to domestic assaults, doing traffic stops with empty guns.
[01:03:51.107 --> 01:03:52.007]  You're joking.
[01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.388]  Hold on, that is incredibly newsworthy.
[01:03:54.408 --> 01:03:56.929]  I mean, I believe you, but I didn't know that.
[01:03:57.289 --> 01:04:03.110]  You're telling me military police are patrolling in some cases with their firearms unloaded and stowed?
[01:04:04.446 --> 01:04:04.986]  Absolutely.
[01:04:05.367 --> 01:04:22.017]  And you know, we had one extreme case where the Provost Marshal was requiring his folks to get their magazines with ammunition, heat-sealed in a bag, and they had to check it out of the arms room and check it back in inside of this heat-sealed bag.
[01:04:22.057 --> 01:04:24.439]  And if it was open, they did what's called a 15-6 investigation
[01:04:29.962 --> 01:04:35.067]  Man, talk about control freaks.
[01:04:35.347 --> 01:04:39.591]  I mean, that's like where the Secretary of Defense Panetta member wouldn't be around armed troops.
[01:04:40.853 --> 01:04:45.097]  Where would I find that policy?
[01:04:45.417 --> 01:04:46.278]  Because I've never heard of that.
[01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:51.825]  And I would find that one in Pentagon-based security policy manuals?
[01:04:51.845 --> 01:04:55.268]  Would you find that in Pentagon-based security policy manuals?
[01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:56.329]  We're gonna look it up.
[01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.729]  Thank you.
[01:05:10.455 --> 01:05:13.237]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.

[01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:14.991]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:15.311 --> 01:06:18.975]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:19.035 --> 01:06:21.457]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:26.922]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:27.343 --> 01:06:33.569]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:39.552]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:39.973 --> 01:06:43.635]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:44.155 --> 01:06:48.178]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:53.961]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:54.381 --> 01:06:57.383]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:57.943 --> 01:06:59.344]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:59.924 --> 01:07:00.345]  It's here.

[01:07:12.388 --> 01:07:19.989]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:07:20.409 --> 01:07:25.070]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:07:25.331 --> 01:07:27.251]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:07:27.551 --> 01:07:33.633]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[01:07:33.914 --> 01:07:41.737]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[01:07:42.137 --> 01:07:48.459]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.

[01:08:19.788 --> 01:08:20.588]  You want answers?
[01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:22.289]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:22.909 --> 01:08:26.511]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.111 --> 01:08:31.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:50.720]  Folks, a brain-eating amoeba has been discovered in Louisiana plumbing system.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:58.342]  So you now know the Department of Education is now running the water systems in Louisiana.
[01:09:00.163 --> 01:09:03.484]  A little attempt at sick humor, but it's actually not sick humor.
[01:09:03.504 --> 01:09:09.687]  They put sodium fluoride and hydrofluorosilic acid in the water that lowers the IQ on average
[01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:16.371]  17 points for women, 23 points for boys who drink it during the first 10 years of life.
[01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:19.211]  That's a major Harvard study.
[01:09:19.251 --> 01:09:20.412]  I just thought I'd throw that out there.
[01:09:20.432 --> 01:09:26.715]  We're worried about brain-eating amoebas that might kill, wait for it, five to six people a year.
[01:09:26.995 --> 01:09:29.377]  That's the number I know because they have them in Lake Travis.
[01:09:30.037 --> 01:09:39.603]  And so I'm up on that data because I don't go out there in August because there are brain-eating amoebas and there's probably one chance out of a million that my children might get one when the lake's 90 degrees.
[01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:41.184]  I don't want to go swimming when it's 90 degrees anyways.
[01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:44.852]  But there you go, folks.
[01:09:45.332 --> 01:09:47.735]  We need to ban swimming because there might be an amoeba in it.
[01:09:48.276 --> 01:09:51.480]  And the reason I mention that is it's the same idea of these mass shootings.
[01:09:53.365 --> 01:10:05.813]  Statistically, there's 64 to 63, just department zone numbers, people killed in mass shootings every year, and less than 30 of those are real mass shootings where it's done to be a mass shooting.
[01:10:06.074 --> 01:10:12.758]  They call gang-related, two gangs shooting each other, and then bystanders get shot up in a restaurant or in a college campus.
[01:10:13.779 --> 01:10:14.699]  Less than 70 people.
[01:10:16.567 --> 01:10:21.451]  If you want a source on that, the entire nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central, we're going to be covering that.
[01:10:21.471 --> 01:10:22.151]  But here's the L.A.
[01:10:22.191 --> 01:10:22.551]  Times.
[01:10:22.972 --> 01:10:25.133]  Gun crime has plunged, but Americans think it's up.
[01:10:25.674 --> 01:10:29.396]  Study says more than half of Americans think gun crime has jumped.
[01:10:29.817 --> 01:10:34.860]  The Bureau of Justice Statistics report noted researchers aren't sure why there's the misrepresentation.
[01:10:37.062 --> 01:10:40.044]  The rate of violent crimes fell more sharply, 75 percent.
[01:10:42.665 --> 01:10:44.867]  So some types of gun crime is 75 percent.
[01:10:44.927 --> 01:10:46.828]  Our number is 49 percent overall.
[01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:52.453]  Violent gun, illegal gun crime, 49 percent drop.
[01:10:52.973 --> 01:10:53.713]  As high as 75.
[01:10:54.634 --> 01:10:55.975]  So that's the facts.
[01:10:56.015 --> 01:10:57.276]  We've covered that ad nauseum.
[01:10:57.697 --> 01:11:03.321]  Obama comes out with snortinophilus, snuffinophilus, whatever his name is, the former Clinton minion.
[01:11:06.227 --> 01:11:13.414]  And George Stephanopoulos, folks, I'm being sarcastic again, and he said that no one in the world thinks the rebels might have launched a chemical attack.
[01:11:14.035 --> 01:11:15.296]  What, in an alternate universe?
[01:11:15.936 --> 01:11:21.361]  And that also, we have the clip coming up, that over 80% of Americans believe
[01:11:25.097 --> 01:11:29.080]  That they want to, you know, get the anti-gun bills passed, support that.
[01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:32.223]  Now, of course, you know the polls were pretty much the opposite.
[01:11:32.603 --> 01:11:37.567]  Upwards of 70% were against the gun grab, and it blew up in their face, and that came out.
[01:11:38.248 --> 01:11:39.969]  But not in Obama universe!
[01:11:40.049 --> 01:11:44.493]  I mean, he is the most bald-faced liar I've ever seen.
[01:11:44.553 --> 01:11:45.413]  And it gets worse!
[01:11:46.815 --> 01:11:50.578]  Their policy is not to tell the truth now that they've been caught lying.
[01:11:51.858 --> 01:11:54.979]  It's now to double and triple and quadruple down with the deception.
[01:11:55.039 --> 01:11:57.300]  Now, we trust but verify.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:03.561]  As Reagan said, and we had a caller earlier who said that he was a Army special agent.
[01:12:04.382 --> 01:12:06.862]  It's one of the armed kind of, you know, Army investigator guys.
[01:12:07.783 --> 01:12:08.883]  And he said, look it up.
[01:12:08.963 --> 01:12:15.765]  A lot of bases don't let the police even, much less other military people, carry guns.
[01:12:16.305 --> 01:12:18.486]  We went and looked it up and found all the news about it.
[01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:25.015]  We found regulatory quotes on it, but actually no news.
[01:12:25.336 --> 01:12:26.557]  That's very newsworthy.
[01:12:26.597 --> 01:12:29.120]  I gave it to Kit Daniels, one of our great writers.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.421]  Amazing!
[01:12:30.501 --> 01:12:32.103]  So, we need to look at this base.
[01:12:33.556 --> 01:12:39.040]  Were they precluding all the special agents and everybody else from being armed?
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.562]  Another victim disarmament zone.
[01:12:42.202 --> 01:12:44.384]  Just like Fort Hood, nobody was allowed to have guns.
[01:12:44.764 --> 01:12:48.767]  And they had to run and find their guns and wait five minutes for the cops to show up.
[01:12:49.567 --> 01:12:53.910]  Which was still a good response time, but he wouldn't have been able to kill 13 people if that was the case.
[01:12:54.651 --> 01:13:02.797]  And then Al Qaeda's leader announced Friday, he's also the leader of the main Syrian rebels that Obama's arming, that he wanted mass shootings in America.
[01:13:03.743 --> 01:13:04.784]  Everybody forgets that.
[01:13:04.824 --> 01:13:07.388]  We have it up on Infowars.com.
[01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:12.073]  The headline, Navy Yard Shooting Related to...
[01:13:14.249 --> 01:13:23.351]  Zawahiri's call for attacks, and that's a great headline, but it really should be, is the Naval Yard attack connected to Al-Qaeda call for mass shootings?
[01:13:23.451 --> 01:13:25.872]  Or Al-Qaeda call for mass shootings, is it related?
[01:13:26.372 --> 01:13:32.013]  I don't know, but now they're saying two shooters, one dead, one injured, three other shooters on the loose.
[01:13:32.553 --> 01:13:35.274]  Who knows what the truth is, but remember, it's all a good distraction.
[01:13:36.462 --> 01:13:44.394]  From last week, fewer Americans than ever trust government to handle problems in a new Gallup poll.
[01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:55.534]  And Congress has a 10% approval rating, and Obama has lost more than 25% in under 30s.
[01:13:55.614 --> 01:13:58.195]  It was 17% last month, now it's 20-plus percent.
[01:13:58.475 --> 01:14:00.136]  He is in free fall with all of his scandals.
[01:14:00.756 --> 01:14:06.139]  But never mind, there's a cryptic White House message that came out saying, Respect Authority!
[01:14:06.799 --> 01:14:08.940]  Do what you're told during emergencies.
[01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:15.312]  And again, just thank God one of these shooters didn't get outside the base or they would have shut down all of D.C.
[01:14:15.572 --> 01:14:17.333]  And they did shut down Reagan International.
[01:14:17.873 --> 01:14:19.414]  And they did shut down a bunch of the schools.
[01:14:19.494 --> 01:14:25.116]  And they told everybody, shelter in place in the cafeteria where they were being shot.
[01:14:25.716 --> 01:14:27.877]  We played the clip from a press conference last hour.
[01:14:28.478 --> 01:14:36.701]  They told everybody, we want you to basically sit there and just let yourself be shot.
[01:14:36.721 --> 01:14:37.882]  But first I want to play this clip.
[01:14:38.795 --> 01:15:00.182]  of where they are announcing we're getting calls and saying did you hear that the same federal group that went and was involved in the Boston bombing cover-up that they were dispatched to this and yes indeed so you can know this if they covered up the Boston bombing and they clearly staged that can we can we believe
[01:15:01.567 --> 01:15:09.114]  Can we believe the official story of what we were told with this?
[01:15:09.474 --> 01:15:10.195]  So here's that clip.
[01:15:10.916 --> 01:15:19.118]  We're getting some more information from our Justice Department and from our sources on the ground about what actually is transpiring inside the Navy Yard at this time.
[01:15:19.158 --> 01:15:34.701]  And what we understand is that the same team that helped pull Zohar Zarnaya from the boat in Boston, when there was a great concern about additional explosives and what was actually going to transpire in the city of Boston, that same team is on the ground in the Navy Yard.
[01:15:34.721 --> 01:15:36.601]  And so they're really not taking anything off the table.
[01:15:36.701 --> 01:15:42.762]  We may have this report that one shooter is dead, but a question about whether or not there's still a risk to the area.
[01:15:43.182 --> 01:15:53.084]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're looking at the latest numbers of dead up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, our backup site.
[01:15:53.224 --> 01:15:56.585]  Not really a mirror, it has a lot of original news on it as well.
[01:15:56.625 --> 01:16:01.405]  So PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, DrudgeReport.com has great coverage as well.
[01:16:01.746 --> 01:16:03.826]  At least six dead, ten wounded.
[01:16:05.484 --> 01:16:07.569]  AP reports at least one shooter dead.
[01:16:07.589 --> 01:16:10.776]  DC Police Chief says two other shooters may be at large.
[01:16:12.825 --> 01:16:15.346]  Also, wearing military-style uniforms.
[01:16:15.366 --> 01:16:18.467]  3,000 workers told to shelter in place.
[01:16:19.067 --> 01:16:20.628]  At least two cops among the victims.
[01:16:20.728 --> 01:16:22.308]  NBC reports a war zone.
[01:16:22.689 --> 01:16:26.030]  SWAT-style teams deployed at Capitol and all over D.C.
[01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:29.651]  Homeland says no connections to terrorism, kind of like the Fort Hood shooting.
[01:16:30.031 --> 01:16:35.453]  If it really is Al-Qaeda connected, where our government's funding them, then they'll say it wasn't terror.
[01:16:36.754 --> 01:16:39.075]  And then that's good, because they can then blame it on the American gun owner.
[01:16:39.275 --> 01:16:40.095]  That's their favorite thing.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:47.484]  And then the White House is telling citizens to listen to the authorities.
[01:16:48.564 --> 01:16:55.449]  And we've also got shooting from the fourth floor overlook aiming at people in the cafeteria who again were told to just sit there and take it.
[01:16:56.389 --> 01:16:57.230]  Just ridiculous.
[01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:57.910]  I shouldn't laugh.
[01:16:57.970 --> 01:16:58.591]  It's so sick.
[01:16:59.051 --> 01:17:04.835]  We've got that training video we have up on the site where they tell you to use shoes or scissors.
[01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:09.675]  That's up on Infowars.com, a flashback to that, Julie Wilson put that out.
[01:17:10.916 --> 01:17:16.242]  And then a Russian official mocks a clear confirmation of American exceptionalism.
[01:17:16.262 --> 01:17:20.588]  You know, that's disgusting that the Russians are gloating over this, but that's one idiot.
[01:17:22.329 --> 01:17:24.752]  We're all in this together trying to stop World War 3.
[01:17:25.312 --> 01:17:26.153]  We've got some good news.
[01:17:26.213 --> 01:17:31.759]  Abortion clinics closing at record rates as abortion becomes unpopular despite them trying to force feed it on everybody.
[01:17:32.921 --> 01:17:33.321]  Good news.
[01:17:33.421 --> 01:17:37.165]  Obama may meet Iran's leader at the UN.
[01:17:37.766 --> 01:17:38.907]  Draws a new red line.
[01:17:40.021 --> 01:17:41.642]  So there's a lot of things happening.
[01:17:41.662 --> 01:17:42.782]  I haven't gotten into all the other news.
[01:17:42.843 --> 01:17:45.064]  Obamacare will question your sex life.
[01:17:45.524 --> 01:17:47.745]  Congress gets sneaky exemption from law.
[01:17:48.725 --> 01:17:50.847]  Punishes senator who tries to stop it.
[01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.068]  There are death panels in there.
[01:17:53.108 --> 01:17:54.048]  The Senate is reporting.
[01:17:55.089 --> 01:17:56.770]  And confusion is reigning.
[01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:59.291]  Polls show Americans are absolutely against it.
[01:18:00.311 --> 01:18:03.733]  It is meant to shut the country down and bankrupt the average person, folks.
[01:18:03.953 --> 01:18:05.174]  It's written by offshore banks.
[01:18:06.411 --> 01:18:14.255]  The good news is people are waking up to it, but that's okay because Obama gave a speech and said the war has come home to our military.
[01:18:14.275 --> 01:18:19.018]  You know how many military die from all the deadly vaccines and drugs they're given?
[01:18:19.038 --> 01:18:22.960]  You know how many military die from the horrible care at the VA?
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.401]  But again, you never hear about that.
[01:18:25.081 --> 01:18:31.885]  The sewer mainstream media that's dying is still, during a crisis, able to set the agenda.
[01:18:33.171 --> 01:18:43.336]  But not for long, and more and more the new media, the real media that Dianne Feinstein and others say that they want to shut down and regulate, they're losing control.
[01:18:43.356 --> 01:18:47.378]  Let's go to a call here from John in Maryland, then we'll go to Robert and Chris.
[01:18:47.839 --> 01:18:49.399]  John, what's your take on this, sir?
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:51.721]  Alex?
[01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:52.361]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:53.261 --> 01:19:02.226]  Hey, so I was, you know, considering the last couple of shootings that we've had, this is like the first one where
[01:19:02.734 --> 01:19:03.395]  The U.S.
[01:19:03.435 --> 01:19:06.940]  government is like the victim and the hero at the same time.
[01:19:09.543 --> 01:19:11.526]  And the last attacks didn't go so well.
[01:19:11.686 --> 01:19:19.837]  We exposed the Boston bombing thing, and the school shooting in Sandy Hook, and the movie theater shooting.
[01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.749]  You know, it just didn't work.
[01:19:22.809 --> 01:19:24.050]  It kind of backfired on them.
[01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:28.751]  Yeah, so now they're doing it if it is a false flag on their own turf, where they can control it.
[01:19:29.051 --> 01:19:32.511]  Why don't they just do this on a movie lot then, officially, and just have it be done with?
[01:19:34.052 --> 01:19:38.713]  Well, you know, they gotta initiate some new guys.
[01:19:39.673 --> 01:19:46.654]  They gotta get some of the old guys that are working for them.
[01:19:47.135 --> 01:19:48.655]  You know, they gotta make sure that they're still in.
[01:19:49.631 --> 01:19:51.012]  And aren't saying no to anything.
[01:19:52.092 --> 01:19:58.235]  And an interesting thing is we just had training for the National Guard this week, and some people had training last week.
[01:19:58.435 --> 01:20:01.016]  You know, right in between the... Tell you what, John, I want to hear about this training.
[01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:01.536]  And Robert?
[01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:03.257]  Oh, he used to work at the Naval Base.
[01:20:03.277 --> 01:20:04.097]  I'm going right to him.
[01:20:04.518 --> 01:20:07.399]  And then Chris, we're going to get to everybody straight ahead.
[01:20:10.237 --> 01:20:12.398]  So, you've decided to get prepared.
[01:20:12.598 --> 01:20:18.640]  You're not sure that a case of ramen and a couple of granola bars under your bed will cut it as long-term food storage anymore.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:19.460]  You're in luck!
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:23.041]  At Emergency Essentials, we have all the resources to get you started.

[01:20:41.207 --> 01:20:45.530]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:51.314]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:20:51.414 --> 01:20:54.756]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:22:38.896 --> 01:22:41.858]  Did you know there are 3 million edible food plants on Earth?
[01:22:42.038 --> 01:22:44.599]  And none have the nutritional value of the hemp plant.
[01:22:44.839 --> 01:22:45.139]  We're good.
[01:23:09.096 --> 01:23:13.980]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.661]  What are bitcoins?
[01:23:16.101 --> 01:23:22.166]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[01:23:22.586 --> 01:23:24.027]  No bank needed.
[01:23:24.407 --> 01:23:29.691]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[01:23:30.092 --> 01:23:31.873]  You are in control of your money.
[01:23:32.353 --> 01:23:33.134]  And the best part?

[01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:44.542]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[01:23:45.002 --> 01:23:48.665]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[01:24:06.592 --> 01:24:08.133]  We mine your business.
[01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:23.466]  Alright, let's jam in three calls during this segment.
[01:24:23.566 --> 01:24:26.689]  John in Maryland's National Guard, he was telling us about drills they just had.
[01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:33.297]  Yeah, they're having terrorism drills and martial law drills and power-out drills all over the country right now.
[01:24:34.076 --> 01:24:39.137]  That, again, blowing up things on the tarmac in Boston, not telling people it's a drill.
[01:24:39.557 --> 01:24:41.518]  It's all psychological operations.
[01:24:42.498 --> 01:24:49.100]  And we have Pentagon documents where they plan mass shootings on military bases to be blamed on their political enemies.
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:50.821]  It's Operation Northwood.
[01:24:50.921 --> 01:24:53.041]  So, anything is possible.
[01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:54.502]  This is perfect timing.
[01:24:54.842 --> 01:24:56.482]  We know they staged the Boston bombing.
[01:24:56.502 --> 01:24:59.323]  That evidence is overwhelming, incontrovertible.
[01:24:59.963 --> 01:25:02.504]  Let's go to John in Maryland.
[01:25:02.524 --> 01:25:03.264]  Finish up your point.
[01:25:04.568 --> 01:25:06.568]  So, um, yeah, well, it's drill.
[01:25:07.128 --> 01:25:08.109]  That's just what they call it.
[01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:09.289]  We weren't actually doing any drills.
[01:25:09.349 --> 01:25:15.390]  It was just, it was just some regular training, but sure, sure.
[01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:18.150]  Everybody's talking about 9-11 and Syria and all this stuff.
[01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:29.532]  And, um, but you know, after that they compile all these reports and then, you know, during the week, the National Guard guys that are full time, they sit around and they talk about it and they break it down and you know, the leadership and all that.
[01:25:29.652 --> 01:25:33.293]  And guess what's on their mind right now where they're talking about everything they went over.
[01:25:34.426 --> 01:25:35.967]  Um, I think that's interesting.
[01:25:36.907 --> 01:25:44.509]  And then you were talking about two weeks ago, you were asking for people, what would they do if they were going to launch a false flag attack?
[01:25:44.789 --> 01:25:47.350]  And most of the callers said a mass shooting at bases.
[01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:48.490]  Yes.
[01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:52.011]  And I'm thinking like next level, right?
[01:25:52.031 --> 01:25:54.132]  Because, you know, obviously it's not going to end after today.
[01:25:54.815 --> 01:26:04.579]  So, you know, you got this missing nuke and these power outage drills and all that stuff, and you have this inherent characteristic of a nuclear weapon where there's this EMP blast that comes out of it.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:12.923]  And I'm thinking, you know, it's FEMA Region 3 where, you know, the major drill, the major cross-agency drill is going to happen.
[01:26:13.503 --> 01:26:19.826]  And if the power goes out for a little while, within, you know, 300 or 400 miles of the D.C.
[01:26:19.966 --> 01:26:24.208]  area, you could have a small purge of
[01:26:24.821 --> 01:26:29.958]  Any counter-revolutionaries that they've blacklisted can create a buffer zone
[01:26:31.332 --> 01:26:32.653]  For the D.C.
[01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:33.233]  area.
[01:26:33.493 --> 01:26:41.959]  You know it's funny you say that because the Pentagon came out last year, this made national news, and said they were training to fight the Tea Party on the East Coast.
[01:26:42.459 --> 01:26:46.901]  And when you say this, the globalists are occupiers, and they see America waking up.
[01:26:47.342 --> 01:26:56.207]  They could be capable of shutting the power off nationwide, to bring in martial law, blaming it on their enemies, as an excuse to finally take the country.
[01:26:56.227 --> 01:26:57.348]  Because we think of the government
[01:26:58.288 --> 01:26:59.329]  As being part of the country.
[01:26:59.409 --> 01:27:01.090]  No, it's the takeover group.
[01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:06.892]  They behave just like a foreign enemy because they are in anything is possible.
[01:27:06.932 --> 01:27:07.953]  That is very well said.
[01:27:08.693 --> 01:27:10.874]  Yeah, and they love beta testing everything.
[01:27:11.094 --> 01:27:15.036]  They never go full ride right off the bat.
[01:27:15.136 --> 01:27:19.338]  They have to initiate some people into the program.
[01:27:19.478 --> 01:27:20.739]  That's because they're scientists.
[01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:24.160]  It's a scientific dictatorship and they always pre-test.
[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:25.061]  You're absolutely right.
[01:27:25.834 --> 01:27:26.435]  Without a doubt.
[01:27:26.895 --> 01:27:37.043]  And if there's a couple isolated blackouts all over the country, or just on the East Coast, and then that infects other systems or something, and we need better cyber security.
[01:27:37.083 --> 01:27:38.704]  And then cyber security saves us.
[01:27:38.724 --> 01:27:39.325]  You're a genius.
[01:27:39.405 --> 01:27:40.025]  God bless you.
[01:27:40.085 --> 01:27:40.626]  Absolutely.
[01:27:40.726 --> 01:27:44.809]  Any of this is very possible, maybe even probable, unless we expose it.
[01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:47.431]  Robert used to work at the Naval Base.
[01:27:47.551 --> 01:27:48.912]  Robert, calling from D.C.
[01:27:49.332 --> 01:27:50.393]  What is your breakdown, sir?
[01:27:50.433 --> 01:27:51.014]  Thank you for calling.
[01:27:51.596 --> 01:27:52.136]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:52.196 --> 01:27:55.158]  Well, basically, I used to work there.
[01:27:55.178 --> 01:28:04.082]  I know that they would periodically have the active denial system, where they would actually have everything on speaker, you know, doing this.
[01:28:04.262 --> 01:28:05.302]  It's kind of like a fire drill.
[01:28:05.783 --> 01:28:09.524]  So, I mean, of course they're prepared for events like this, and they act like they're not.
[01:28:10.965 --> 01:28:13.806]  Me personally, I joined Freedom From Covert Harassment.
[01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:18.668]  What they did to me was they implanted me with an RFID chip and I got an infection in my neck.
[01:28:18.988 --> 01:28:20.709]  I'm still in the process of getting this out.
[01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:22.769]  And funny enough, my neighbor knows you.
[01:28:22.909 --> 01:28:24.310]  He's been asking me to call you.
[01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:27.091]  But basically, I joined Freedom From Covert Harassment.
[01:28:27.111 --> 01:28:28.651]  They really started targeting me bad.
[01:28:29.272 --> 01:28:31.072]  They would actually chase me around D.C.
[01:28:31.612 --> 01:28:32.513]  and gang stalk me.
[01:28:32.993 --> 01:28:34.273]  They, as in these look like D.O.D.
[01:28:34.313 --> 01:28:34.734]  officials.
[01:28:35.214 --> 01:28:36.894]  And they know what's going on.
[01:28:36.934 --> 01:28:37.975]  They're basically causing
[01:28:38.836 --> 01:28:40.078]  A lot of turmoil out there.
[01:28:40.419 --> 01:28:48.256]  Well, you know what's crazy about this, and I appreciate your call, sir, is that as wild as that sounds, they have implanted a lot of DOD people with chips.
[01:28:48.276 --> 01:28:49.098]  That's been in the news.
[01:28:49.923 --> 01:28:58.065]  You know, the fact that the classified programs are there, but there's also a lot of people then that are schizophrenic who also get freaked out by all this, but they don't need to implant you.
[01:28:58.105 --> 01:29:00.605]  Your smartphone tracks everything you do.
[01:29:01.085 --> 01:29:03.246]  Your car tracks you now, new cars.
[01:29:03.986 --> 01:29:05.166]  Your smart meter does it.
[01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:08.087]  They're building this spy grid in everywhere.
[01:29:08.407 --> 01:29:17.689]  Chris in Tennessee, you say you can confirm, we've now confirmed, that they have disarmed many of the bases as well, so even security personnel can't have loaded firearms.
[01:29:18.795 --> 01:29:19.996]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:29:20.216 --> 01:29:21.237]  First time, long time.
[01:29:22.038 --> 01:29:28.725]  I work for Loomis Armored Truck out here in Nashville, but I go on post every day at Fort Campbell, home of the 104th Airborne.
[01:29:30.211 --> 01:29:38.954]  And besides my partner and myself and the military police, which, you know, they can't be everywhere at once, we are the only people on that base carrying a firearm.
[01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:43.635]  And I've often thought, you know, if something happened, you know, it'd be up to me to help protect all these soldiers.
[01:29:43.715 --> 01:29:51.738]  I'll tell you what, Ed Asner is going to pop up and pop in and talk about some of the big news he's been covering.
[01:29:51.758 --> 01:29:53.478]  And then I'm going to come right back to you.
[01:29:53.518 --> 01:29:54.299]  Don't hang up, Chris.
[01:29:54.359 --> 01:29:55.279]  I want to discuss this.
[01:29:55.339 --> 01:29:56.059]  It's very important.
[01:29:56.419 --> 01:29:57.920]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:59.349 --> 01:30:02.331]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.272 --> 01:30:05.954]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:13.813]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:30:14.033 --> 01:30:19.315]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:30:19.555 --> 01:30:27.098]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:30:27.278 --> 01:30:36.382]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:30:36.602 --> 01:30:43.585]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:30:43.745 --> 01:30:46.627]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:30:46.647 --> 01:30:53.570]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:55.050]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:56.491]  Another plane just hit!
[01:31:10.615 --> 01:31:23.743]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[01:31:24.383 --> 01:31:34.690]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless Pure Nano Silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.
[01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:39.553]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[01:31:39.973 --> 01:31:56.043]  For many who are new to silver that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays, our nano-silver soap, and our most popular product, the all-natural nano-silver gel.
[01:31:56.863 --> 01:32:04.286]  Visit www.silverlungs.com to learn more about the industry-leading technology of the Silver Lungs System.
[01:32:04.706 --> 01:32:07.948]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:10.441 --> 01:32:15.345]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[01:32:15.946 --> 01:32:19.229]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[01:32:19.769 --> 01:32:22.651]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[01:32:23.192 --> 01:32:26.014]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[01:32:26.635 --> 01:32:32.660]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:32:33.261 --> 01:32:36.704]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:32:37.324 --> 01:32:48.006]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[01:32:48.727 --> 01:32:53.728]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[01:32:54.228 --> 01:32:59.649]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,
[01:32:59.969 --> 01:33:02.093]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:33:02.353 --> 01:33:04.557]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com.

[01:33:26.274 --> 01:33:27.177]  Well in opera!
[01:33:27.218 --> 01:33:31.835]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:44.511 --> 01:33:46.512]  All right, folks, we are back live.
[01:33:46.572 --> 01:33:48.833]  More of your phone calls coming up.
[01:33:48.933 --> 01:33:50.834]  Wide open phones.
[01:33:51.014 --> 01:33:55.796]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:33:55.816 --> 01:33:56.416]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:56.436 --> 01:34:02.379]  All I know is you've got the scandal of our government running al-Qaeda against the Syrians.
[01:34:02.819 --> 01:34:05.160]  You've got all of Obama's scandals coming out.
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:22.774]  The fact that the Republican leadership's working with Obama on all these different corrupt operations, the American people waking up across the political spectrum, coming together against all the tyranny that's taking place, the too-big-to-fail banks, and then magically you get a mass shooting at a military base.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:31.830]  A very controlled area, and they are reporting, first they said three shooters, then they said two, now they're saying three again.
[01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:36.277]  Two more possible suspects wearing military-style uniforms at the Navy Yard.
[01:34:36.297 --> 01:34:38.860]  We're going to continue after Ed Asner leaves us.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:41.143]  He's been very gracious to come on on short notice.
[01:34:42.136 --> 01:34:44.397]  And just spend 10 minutes with us.
[01:34:44.437 --> 01:34:49.019]  Of course, Ed Asner really doesn't need any introduction.
[01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:57.363]  He's been the head of the Screen Actors Guild, starred in more than 50 major motion pictures and the top TV show, of course, Lou Grant as well.
[01:34:58.303 --> 01:35:00.124]  And he joins us.
[01:35:00.364 --> 01:35:01.505]  He's been in so many great films.
[01:35:01.565 --> 01:35:07.787]  One of my favorites was Up, a good wholesome show that's a film that my children have watched, I don't think, four or five times.
[01:35:07.867 --> 01:35:08.267]  I love it.
[01:35:08.768 --> 01:35:13.730]  And he just joins us because he has a lot of courage that other people in Hollywood don't have, obviously.
[01:35:14.884 --> 01:35:29.734]  And last Friday it was big national news when he'd gone on the O'Reilly Factor and other shows because he'd given a statement to Hollywood Reporter saying, look, most people in Hollywood won't criticize Obama because they don't want to be called racist.
[01:35:31.155 --> 01:35:33.137]  It doesn't matter what you criticize.
[01:35:33.317 --> 01:35:35.879]  Banker bailouts, NDAA, these wars.
[01:35:36.639 --> 01:35:38.441]  You do it, you get called a racist.
[01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:44.226]  And I think that that takes away from when people really are racist and need to be called racist.
[01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:46.187]  And I see this more and more.
[01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:52.893]  MSNBC has said I'm deeply racist and then didn't say why I'm deeply racist, just that I didn't support Obama.
[01:35:52.933 --> 01:35:55.455]  Well, I didn't support George W. Bush either.
[01:35:56.175 --> 01:35:56.315]  That's
[01:36:13.519 --> 01:36:17.180]  You get, I better not say blackballed, that'll be racist.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:23.623]  They can't even use brown paper bags now in Washington State because they say that's racist.
[01:36:23.643 --> 01:36:25.443]  I never heard of that being racist.
[01:36:25.463 --> 01:36:33.566]  So instead of going after real racism, they're inverting the world now and saying you support the corrupt policies of the government or you're a racist.
[01:36:33.586 --> 01:36:38.528]  So I wanted to get Ed's take on that and also the 50th anniversary of the murder of JFK.
[01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:47.394]  I know he's one of the best stars of one of my favorite films, JFK, that Oliver Stone produced, but I wanted to get his take on 50 Years Later.
[01:36:47.714 --> 01:36:49.475]  Ed Asner, thanks for popping in, sir.
[01:36:50.096 --> 01:36:50.436]  Hey!
[01:36:51.677 --> 01:36:53.578]  I'm always happy to be a part of it.
[01:36:54.278 --> 01:36:54.599]  You bet.
[01:36:54.619 --> 01:36:56.180]  Well, thank you for coming on on short notice.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:08.929]  I just wanted you to briefly give us your take and elaborate on the Hollywood Reporter story and what other stars and famous folks are telling you of why they're scared to criticize Obama.
[01:37:09.289 --> 01:37:11.890]  Well, nobody has said a thing to me.
[01:37:12.571 --> 01:37:26.237]  And I'm not even sure what my actual quote was as to—I said, well, there probably are people who don't want to indict Obama because they don't want to criticize a black president.
[01:37:26.978 --> 01:37:35.382]  But the interesting thing to me with the press is that everybody posits the question, as O'Reilly did with me.
[01:37:36.644 --> 01:37:45.968]  He said, are people—the question, are people not criticized because he's black.
[01:37:47.088 --> 01:38:01.754]  They posit the question, bring me on, and then it becomes my affirmative statement that blacks are not challenged when they're the president.
[01:38:03.174 --> 01:38:05.315]  So they made it my question.
[01:38:06.345 --> 01:38:17.584]  And it's amazing to me how convoluted and untrustworthy the press can be when they follow that process.
[01:38:18.502 --> 01:38:25.744]  So you're basically saying that maybe the reporter took you out of context and then O'Reilly obsessed on it.
[01:38:26.284 --> 01:38:36.286]  But undoubtedly, I think there is some truth to the gist of what you said because the media... There may be, but I have not talked to anyone.
[01:38:36.626 --> 01:38:37.666]  I don't ask anyone.
[01:38:38.026 --> 01:38:38.926]  It's their business.
[01:38:39.867 --> 01:38:41.967]  I'll let them feel whatever they need to feel.
[01:38:41.987 --> 01:38:45.768]  I am delighted that
[01:38:46.728 --> 01:38:50.651]  What's his name?
[01:38:51.091 --> 01:39:05.520]  Cornel West and Smiley have taken his issue with Obama and of course they get away with it because they're black.
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:14.666]  But they'll probably pull the same thing on them as they do on Jews who criticize Israel and call themselves hating Jews or self-hating blacks.
[01:39:16.499 --> 01:39:18.520]  Yeah, that's what's sad about the Obama thing.
[01:39:18.881 --> 01:39:27.366]  I mean, I knew he was going to be cynical and be the same as the establishment had done before him, but I did hope it would help with race relations.
[01:39:27.846 --> 01:39:30.128]  And unfortunately, they put statistics out that they're...
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.702]  Really lost a lot of that because the media has been playing the race card so much.
[01:39:35.782 --> 01:39:37.343]  Yeah.
[01:39:37.423 --> 01:39:39.865]  I think it's time that they stop it.
[01:39:40.245 --> 01:39:41.606]  I think it's time they grow up.
[01:39:42.126 --> 01:39:49.190]  I certainly think it's time for people to ignore the inferences that the media makes on this color business.
[01:39:52.011 --> 01:40:00.056]  I tried to send a response to the Chicago Defender who attacked me as a racist.
[01:40:01.065 --> 01:40:02.186]  Uh, four of our statements.
[01:40:02.987 --> 01:40:12.893]  And I said, uh, uh, my, my, my, the Chicago Defender selling its paper by accusing me of being a racist.
[01:40:12.953 --> 01:40:16.296]  And of course, that's a famous... When pigs fly.
[01:40:16.716 --> 01:40:17.416]  When pigs fly.
[01:40:17.757 --> 01:40:20.138]  Well, I mean, that's a famous black paper for those that don't know.
[01:40:21.139 --> 01:40:22.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.021]  How you been?
[01:40:24.938 --> 01:40:29.020]  Oh, I've been doing pretty good just watching the whole world meltdown, but I tell you there's been some good news.
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:41.865]  The entire attempt to escalate the Syrian Civil War and the fact that the Pentagon and others have been running Al-Qaeda, that really blew up in Obama's face and it's good to see some peace talks starting up.
[01:40:42.405 --> 01:40:49.768]  What has been your take on the whole push to start not just a bombardment but boots on the ground in Syria?
[01:40:50.862 --> 01:40:53.943]  Well, I think it sucks.
[01:40:54.663 --> 01:41:05.946]  Naturally, I mean, that creature, that diabolical creature, Vladimir Putin, is in the catbird seat.
[01:41:06.526 --> 01:41:11.648]  That's the first time I ever saw a vulture in the catbird seat.
[01:41:12.308 --> 01:41:15.189]  The ability to propose this idea
[01:41:15.962 --> 01:41:22.484]  Which we find as a straw to clutch at, or Obama does anyway.
[01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:33.208]  And man, Putin, if he wants to screw it up and make Obama look even worse, can he yank it away as well?
[01:41:34.628 --> 01:41:35.188]  Well, you're right.
[01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:38.910]  A lot of people romanticize Putin, but I mean, he's really a scary guy.
[01:41:40.983 --> 01:41:47.431]  And certainly the man who certainly in the past did his homework and I'm sure still does it.
[01:41:48.453 --> 01:41:55.542]  I mean, I think his policies on homosexuals and the girl band are despicable.
[01:41:56.334 --> 01:42:02.599]  But I think he's cottoning to the general flow of feeling of his people.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.021]  Well, I was about to say, it's not just Putin.
[01:42:05.041 --> 01:42:07.724]  The media has even gone, oh look, Russia's making America look bad.
[01:42:07.764 --> 01:42:10.326]  How about Russia's made the warmongers look bad?
[01:42:10.346 --> 01:42:15.971]  You've got 91% of Americans in a Reuters poll, Ed Asner.
[01:42:16.551 --> 01:42:17.351]  I would hope so.
[01:42:17.372 --> 01:42:20.493]  Maybe now they'll start to think about not looking so askance at the socialist ideas.
[01:42:38.387 --> 01:42:44.712]  Well, the problem is, Ed, you know, anytime people try to actually help the poor, big, big special interests come in and scoop it up.
[01:42:44.772 --> 01:42:48.615]  Now, Ed, I want to ask you about getting back to the whole race thing a little bit here.
[01:42:49.416 --> 01:42:57.943]  Talking to folks in Hollywood, then, why do you think some of the so-called left has not been critical of Obama more outside of the race issue?
[01:42:58.583 --> 01:43:01.306]  I just don't think they felt the urgent nature.
[01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:05.109]  Also, they expended themselves pretty well on Iraq.
[01:43:06.148 --> 01:43:08.430]  And, of course, that went down the toilet.
[01:43:09.211 --> 01:43:14.875]  A million people in the streets didn't bother George W. at all.
[01:43:15.616 --> 01:43:22.381]  So I think they—it was too early to react.
[01:43:23.462 --> 01:43:26.665]  They don't feel like reacting every time a whistle is blown.
[01:43:27.445 --> 01:43:30.568]  So they probably were waiting to take action.
[01:43:31.501 --> 01:43:33.547]  And now it's been taken out of their hands.
[01:43:34.069 --> 01:43:37.801]  They also saw that a majority of the people were already against the action.
[01:43:40.836 --> 01:43:53.722]  Now, Ed Asner, in closing, and we appreciate you popping into the broadcast today, I wanted to talk about JFK and his assassination in Dallas 50 years ago, coming up here in just a few months.
[01:43:54.582 --> 01:44:02.806]  And I know, of course, you starred and did a great job in the film, and that famous scene of you pistol-whipping Mr. Lemon, Jack Lemon.
[01:44:06.676 --> 01:44:13.218]  Give us your take 50 years later on what you really think happened with JFK.
[01:44:15.779 --> 01:44:21.921]  Well, for anybody who believes the official resolution is bullshit.
[01:44:28.785 --> 01:44:30.606]  We had to beep that, Ed, but go ahead.
[01:44:30.706 --> 01:44:31.606]  Go ahead, beep it.
[01:44:32.246 --> 01:44:37.588]  Now, but, uh, uh, JFK the movie showed one thing.
[01:44:38.168 --> 01:44:45.831]  I've talked, uh, I've read, read definitive pieces about the fact that it couldn't have been, uh, Oswald.
[01:44:46.871 --> 01:44:56.054]  Uh, the only thing that's never been explained to me is, did Oswald indeed, in fact, kill a policeman, uh, what was his name, Tippett?
[01:44:57.455 --> 01:44:58.998]  In the movie theater.
[01:44:59.018 --> 01:45:02.767]  That's something that I don't have any answers for.
[01:45:04.178 --> 01:45:09.699]  Well, for the full radio audience that didn't hear you earlier, restate it maybe using Bravo Sierra.
[01:45:09.979 --> 01:45:15.340]  What is your gut level when it happened versus over the last 50 years?
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:21.182]  And now we have 90 plus percent of Americans in polls saying they believe it was a government conspiracy.
[01:45:21.482 --> 01:45:23.022]  I think that shows America is awake.
[01:45:23.062 --> 01:45:27.643]  But, Ed Azar, for the full radio audience, what is your take on JFK 50 years later?
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:32.783]  Well, I think there were, as always, we have rogue elements in our government.
[01:45:33.203 --> 01:45:34.665]  People have to realize that.
[01:45:35.105 --> 01:45:36.926]  I feel that about 9-11.
[01:45:37.487 --> 01:45:40.409]  I feel rogue elements really did certain things there.
[01:45:40.729 --> 01:45:42.371]  And maybe not just rogue elements.
[01:45:42.451 --> 01:45:43.872]  Maybe they were more official.
[01:45:45.173 --> 01:45:47.735]  I think there was government complicity in 9-11.
[01:45:47.755 --> 01:45:50.057]  I think there was government complicity in JFK.
[01:45:52.082 --> 01:45:54.703]  What is your favorite film that you've ever been in?
[01:45:54.743 --> 01:46:01.144]  Because I was just watching you on screen in JFK with another legend, Mr. Lemon.
[01:46:03.865 --> 01:46:07.106]  What are your favorite three films you've ever been in and who is your favorite actor?
[01:46:07.126 --> 01:46:09.547]  I love Daniel.
[01:46:10.107 --> 01:46:13.288]  I love Daniel whether it was fictional or not.
[01:46:14.168 --> 01:46:17.869]  It was a very interesting take on the Rosenberg, The Departure.
[01:46:19.315 --> 01:46:19.756]  I loved Up.
[01:46:20.376 --> 01:46:22.377]  I loved the fact that I was a piece of Up.
[01:46:22.778 --> 01:46:23.978]  And I loved Elf.
[01:46:24.479 --> 01:46:24.899]  Oh yeah.
[01:46:25.299 --> 01:46:32.944]  Elf to me was the naughtiest and funniest and most charming Christmas movie, I think.
[01:46:33.604 --> 01:46:37.167]  And I think it gets rid of the saccharine Miracle on 34th Street.
[01:46:39.537 --> 01:46:52.481]  Well, I agree with you that those are great movies, but I gotta say, some of the serious films you've been in, and some of the stuff you did back in the 40s and 50s and 60s, so many times I'm watching Turner Classic movies and I go, wow!
[01:46:52.941 --> 01:47:02.324]  I didn't know Ed Asner was in that, and it's just always really hard not to watch you, buddy, and we appreciate you coming on and spending some time with us.
[01:47:02.884 --> 01:47:04.445]  I have a lovely time every time.
[01:47:05.353 --> 01:47:06.593]  Thank you so much, Ed Asner.
[01:47:07.014 --> 01:47:08.674]  Alex, continue, great.
[01:47:08.694 --> 01:47:10.235]  All right, thank you, sir.
[01:47:10.255 --> 01:47:12.055]  All right, there goes Ed Asner.
[01:47:12.155 --> 01:47:13.876]  What a living legend.
[01:47:13.916 --> 01:47:14.636]  What a character.
[01:47:15.156 --> 01:47:18.077]  And he also has that great foundation for autistic kids.
[01:47:18.097 --> 01:47:23.299]  So just search Ed Asner autism and find his sites on that.
[01:47:23.659 --> 01:47:27.320]  And all he does for autistic children out there and exposing the vaccines.
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:29.041]  Definitely a real guy.
[01:47:30.061 --> 01:47:37.626]  Notice how the media distorts who Ed Asner really is versus the real guy.
[01:47:37.646 --> 01:47:44.309]  And I don't agree with that on everything, but I certainly think he's a good human being and a really interesting, funny, living legend.
[01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:48.592]  I mean, who else is on video and film pistol-whipping Jack Lemmon?
[01:47:48.732 --> 01:47:50.213]  I mean, it's just awesome.
[01:47:50.593 --> 01:47:51.514]  You know what we do?
[01:47:52.014 --> 01:47:54.395]  You know what we do on the weekend when we let the kids watch a movie?
[01:47:54.735 --> 01:47:56.837]  We go find an old Jack Lemmon comedy.
[01:47:57.657 --> 01:47:59.518]  And that's what we watch around the house.
[01:47:59.638 --> 01:48:00.678]  I just love Jack Lemmon.
[01:48:00.698 --> 01:48:01.338]  I mean, who doesn't?
[01:48:02.399 --> 01:48:05.400]  Okay, now most young people are going, Jack Lemmon who?
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:10.482]  Is that some guy in Fast and Furious or something?
[01:48:11.331 --> 01:48:12.112]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:48:12.132 --> 01:48:13.853]  You know, we got really heavy stuff going on.
[01:48:13.953 --> 01:48:14.974]  Masses of news.
[01:48:15.574 --> 01:48:16.715]  Second Amendment news.
[01:48:16.835 --> 01:48:17.676]  Your phone calls.
[01:48:17.836 --> 01:48:18.336]  Everything.
[01:48:18.857 --> 01:48:32.327]  And I'm going to come back and go back to Chris, and then we're going to go to Alan, Joe, Truth Raider, Kathy, everybody that wants to be able to break down what's been happening and what's been unfolding.
[01:48:33.608 --> 01:48:37.770]  With the naval shooting and now there's more dead, now they're reporting six dead.
[01:48:38.291 --> 01:48:40.252]  Maybe more multiple shooters on the run.
[01:48:40.472 --> 01:48:43.313]  Will they lock down all of DC and then maybe the rest of the country?
[01:48:44.374 --> 01:48:46.835]  Maybe just make all of America under martial law for three guys?
[01:48:47.855 --> 01:48:48.476]  Like Boston?
[01:48:49.476 --> 01:48:54.599]  Before we go any further, we do want to pray for those that have been injured and for the families of those that have lost loved ones.
[01:48:55.019 --> 01:48:55.980]  Because it is a tragedy.
[01:48:57.133 --> 01:48:58.794]  It's like death by government's a tragedy.
[01:48:59.235 --> 01:49:09.583]  Government's the number one killer in history, and that's why we're sick of people like Harry Reid saying government's only good, and anybody that says government isn't inherently good, like mommy's milk, is bad.
[01:49:10.223 --> 01:49:12.045]  I'm sorry, government is not mother's milk.
[01:49:12.805 --> 01:49:14.187]  It's more like Satan's sting.
[01:49:15.168 --> 01:49:15.949]  Wolf Blitzer.
[01:49:15.969 --> 01:49:17.730]  It's like the name Snake Plissken.
[01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.870]  Totally made up.
[01:49:19.191 --> 01:49:25.155]  What's another fake name like Rambo Johnson or Superman Jones?
[01:49:26.035 --> 01:49:26.536]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:27.396 --> 01:49:30.578]  PRIproducts.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:30.878 --> 01:49:32.860]  We all know the globalists want the
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:35.762]  Quality of life to deteriorate for Americans.
[01:49:36.122 --> 01:49:38.724]  One of their tactics is to increase the price of fuel and limit supply.
[01:49:39.024 --> 01:49:43.187]  Fuel storage is a vital key to preparing for the collapse that we see already happening.
[01:49:43.668 --> 01:49:44.648]  Power Research Inc.
[01:49:44.668 --> 01:49:51.193]  manufactures industrial-grade, refinery-quality fuel treatment to get the most out of your gasoline and diesel fuel for only pennies a gallon.
[01:49:51.213 --> 01:49:51.894]  They are the name.
[01:49:52.254 --> 01:49:55.236]  Just add their fuel treatment and engine power will increase.

[01:50:01.781 --> 01:50:05.683]  Fuel system and engine deposits will be prevented, and I think it gives you better gas mileage.

[01:50:07.044 --> 01:50:08.785]  PRIproducts.com.
[01:50:08.965 --> 01:50:10.346]  The name, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:50:12.067 --> 01:50:15.288]  And we're honored to have SacredGrammar.com.
[01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:15.929]  I read the book.
[01:50:15.969 --> 01:50:17.670]  They've been ready to advertise for months.
[01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:19.730]  That's why you now hear them on the network.
[01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:24.252]  Folks come to us to advertise it up on the network, which is fine because they can't get through to us, but I had to read the book to approve it.
[01:50:24.852 --> 01:50:28.473]  Folks, we have a new great sponsor called SacredGrammar.com, great for homeschoolers.
[01:50:28.813 --> 01:50:31.534]  Now there's a way to learn English grammar using the Holy Bible.
[01:50:31.954 --> 01:50:33.275]  That'll make Homeland Security mad.
[01:50:33.295 --> 01:50:34.975]  This is a terrorist document.
[01:50:35.475 --> 01:50:40.937]  Sacred Grammar is a unique book that teaches all of the fundamentals of English grammar using Bible verses.
[01:50:41.577 --> 01:50:43.398]  The program is affordable and simple to use.
[01:50:43.818 --> 01:50:46.799]  It is a superb supplement and can be used as a teacher's aid.

[01:51:10.208 --> 01:51:14.830]  Every time you eat a cooked food, your body responds by producing an increase in circulating white blood cells.
[01:51:15.170 --> 01:51:20.052]  This happens because nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level.
[01:51:20.492 --> 01:51:26.174]  When we heat food to normal cooking temperatures, we change the shape of the molecules into shapes the body cannot use.
[01:51:26.595 --> 01:51:29.356]  The body now looks at them as toxins and allergens.
[01:51:29.796 --> 01:51:37.379]  In an effort to protect itself from this irritant, the body intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as garbage collectors.
[01:51:37.799 --> 01:51:38.579]  We're good to go!
[01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:01.288]  Call 888-988-3325.

[01:52:09.715 --> 01:52:18.942]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:52:19.002 --> 01:52:25.929]  With this capitalism, what was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:52:25.969 --> 01:52:29.613]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:52:41.304 --> 01:52:41.825]  That's right.
[01:52:41.925 --> 01:52:43.326]  We like to call it Prep-Tember.
[01:52:43.386 --> 01:52:47.769]  And there's no better place to get prepped than with Emergency Essentials at BePrepared.com.

[01:54:28.429 --> 01:54:28.829]  to 2 p.m.
[01:54:28.869 --> 01:54:29.209]  Central.
[01:54:29.249 --> 01:54:29.869]  We're here live.
[01:54:29.909 --> 01:54:34.350]  We come back weeknight 7 o'clock Central with InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:54:36.171 --> 01:54:45.913]  You can find the site and all the news listing and all my films and more at InfoWarsNews.com or link through at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:45.933 --> 01:54:47.594]  We've got some in-studio guests coming in.
[01:54:48.732 --> 01:54:52.235]  Who are with Texas Open Carry and who have been arrested.
[01:54:52.375 --> 01:54:53.396]  It's made national news.
[01:54:53.436 --> 01:55:10.851]  They were in last night on the Sunday show in the last 30 minutes, but I wanted to get them for part of the next hour, most of the next hour, to talk about the Second Amendment in general and the fact that the police in Texas are arresting people who have legal firearms on the street saying they feel threatened.
[01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:25.608]  So, we're going to be looking at this new attack on the Second Amendment that's coming, and make no mistake, Obama Sunday came out and said he was getting ready for a new push to try to get our guns, and then magically, this happened.
[01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:32.353]  Right now, Chris in Tennessee, you were making the point that most bases, most people are disarmed.
[01:55:32.393 --> 01:55:36.376]  In fact, some bases we've confirmed, the MPs aren't allowed to be armed.
[01:55:36.756 --> 01:55:40.178]  They have to go back to an armory to check firearms out.
[01:55:40.239 --> 01:55:40.559]  Go ahead.
[01:55:41.721 --> 01:55:58.306]  Yes, at Fort Campbell, the base I'm on post at every day, the MPs do have weapons, but besides them, the only two guys that I know of that have pistols on their side is my partner and myself, and these bases would just be so much safer for our soldiers if they let them have a sidearm.
[01:55:58.326 --> 01:56:04.268]  They're trained, they know how to use them, and they could stop a wind-up toy if, you know, somebody sends somebody in there to cut loose.
[01:56:05.862 --> 01:56:11.426]  Well, that just shows the nanny state that they do not want the soldiers armed.
[01:56:12.726 --> 01:56:14.127]  Because look at Homeland Security.
[01:56:14.488 --> 01:56:17.029]  They openly say the number one threat is veterans.
[01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:18.650]  So they hate you guys.
[01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:19.991]  Of course they don't want you being armed.
[01:56:21.232 --> 01:56:22.032]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:56:22.093 --> 01:56:24.934]  I mean, the safest place I feel is when I'm on post.
[01:56:24.974 --> 01:56:33.480]  When I'm carrying money out of, say, a Walmart, I feel much more unsafe than when I'm on post because I know it's good people and they need to be able to protect themselves.
[01:56:34.977 --> 01:56:35.957]  You're absolutely right.
[01:56:35.977 --> 01:56:36.977]  Appreciate your call.
[01:56:36.997 --> 01:56:38.638]  Let's go to Truth Raider in Oregon.
[01:56:39.778 --> 01:56:41.578]  Truth Raider's on another subject, so go ahead.
[01:56:41.598 --> 01:56:44.099]  Hello, Alex.
[01:56:44.199 --> 01:56:46.379]  This is your terrorist for freedom.
[01:56:47.179 --> 01:56:49.800]  I've got a couple of subjects, if you have time for it.
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:58.862]  Well, the chemtrail phenomenon that we've had for the past several years, the past four weeks we haven't had any.
[01:56:59.622 --> 01:57:04.123]  What's some information that you might have found out that what's going on concerning that?
[01:57:04.927 --> 01:57:12.690]  And then there's a radio talk show host who, when I called in and asked him about the vehicle code, told me that I was a fruitcake.
[01:57:14.231 --> 01:57:15.471]  And you probably have heard of him.
[01:57:15.491 --> 01:57:19.333]  He has a nationally syndicated show called Handle on the Law.
[01:57:21.158 --> 01:57:36.832]  Well it is true that they've gotten everything where you don't have your home's deed, your car's deed, you get a receipt of title and that's how they've been able to take people's mortgages and cars and then sell holding that paper as derivatives.
[01:57:37.433 --> 01:57:41.256]  And so the average lawyer doesn't even know that type of stuff.
[01:57:41.917 --> 01:57:48.401]  The average lawyer specializes in one area, one area only, and probably doesn't even know all that, sir.
[01:57:48.421 --> 01:57:49.402]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:50.123 --> 01:57:53.085]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:57:53.545 --> 01:57:54.606]  Who should I go to?
[01:57:54.626 --> 01:58:00.890]  There's a lot of people calling in wanting to break down what they've witnessed.
[01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:08.975]  Let's go to... Kathy wants to talk about the big FEMA region drill in FEMA Region 3 coming up.
[01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:09.696]  You got one minute.
[01:58:09.736 --> 01:58:10.016]  Go ahead.
[01:58:11.383 --> 01:58:16.068]  Okay, um, Saturday night I was doing research on the blackout coming up in November.
[01:58:16.089 --> 01:58:20.534]  I'm in FEMA Region 3 and October 1st they're supposed to be doing something.
[01:58:20.574 --> 01:58:22.216]  They're sending 80% of the U.S.
[01:58:22.256 --> 01:58:23.557]  military out of the country.
[01:58:23.938 --> 01:58:26.360]  They're not allowed to come back in until November 5th.
[01:58:26.781 --> 01:58:27.562]  They have 15,000 Russian troops.
[01:58:28.883 --> 01:58:33.726]  My friend at church told me she sees convoys going down her street for the last... Well, ma'am, ma'am, let me be clear.
[01:58:34.526 --> 01:58:43.030]  This is an unprecedented martial law takeover drill on the East Coast, but there's a lot of rumors flying around about this drill as well.
[01:58:43.050 --> 01:58:46.412]  I think people really feel in their gut that there's a problem.
[01:58:47.252 --> 01:58:47.612]  Stay there.
[01:58:47.632 --> 01:58:48.273]  I'll come back to you.
[01:58:50.534 --> 01:58:52.335]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:02.893 --> 02:00:04.814]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:05.294 --> 02:00:08.075]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:14.710 --> 02:00:18.874]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.514 --> 02:00:20.335]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.115 --> 02:00:21.996]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.657 --> 02:00:26.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:30.944]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.066 --> 02:00:38.931]  Well, regardless of whether this is a real attack or a staged event, who knows?
[02:00:38.951 --> 02:00:40.232]  They've staged up before it could be.
[02:00:42.119 --> 02:00:44.300]  It's a victim disarmament zone where it took place.
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:51.503]  It gets all of the scandals of Obama, including Syria, out of the news.
[02:00:53.103 --> 02:00:55.124]  And it's exactly what we were predicting would come.
[02:00:56.525 --> 02:01:01.226]  And Cathy, our country's been eased into martial law for a long time.
[02:01:02.347 --> 02:01:04.708]  And it's getting more intense all the time.
[02:01:05.916 --> 02:01:18.819]  And something big could come up in FEMA Region 3 during these unprecedented riot police on the streets, checkpoints in many areas, shutting the power off, seeing if they can turn it back on.
[02:01:19.519 --> 02:01:20.739]  This is unprecedented.
[02:01:20.779 --> 02:01:24.180]  But I've also seen a lot of rumors flying around.
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:28.841]  So, be prepared as always.
[02:01:29.481 --> 02:01:30.301]  Spread the word.
[02:01:31.001 --> 02:01:33.022]  But I wouldn't spread speculation.
[02:01:35.123 --> 02:01:48.109]  And then, from that point on, if you just spread the word about the overall federalization of society, then they may not be able to get away with staging something.
[02:01:48.889 --> 02:01:58.953]  Because most people in the government are not bad, it's the centralized globalists that we know are bad, because of their own policies and what they promote and what they demonize.
[02:01:59.433 --> 02:02:00.494]  So does that answer your question?
[02:02:01.815 --> 02:02:05.617]  Yes it does, but they're also going to be going into Austin, Texas at the same time.
[02:02:05.977 --> 02:02:06.677]  Isn't that weird?
[02:02:06.717 --> 02:02:08.138]  You're not in FEMA Region 3.
[02:02:08.258 --> 02:02:10.719]  And I wonder who lives in Broadcast from there.
[02:02:11.479 --> 02:02:16.261]  Well ma'am, there are FEMA takeover drills going on basically in any big city all the time.
[02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:37.696]  They are federalization drills, and they are acclimation drills, to then also announce the drill later, after the public sees cars set on fire, helicopters, checkpoints, later they say, oh don't be alarmed, that was just a drill, so that you accept the militarization of our society.
[02:02:39.436 --> 02:02:41.977]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, okay.
[02:02:42.137 --> 02:02:45.298]  There was one more thing too.
[02:02:47.296 --> 02:02:48.276]  Oh, I can't think.
[02:02:48.376 --> 02:02:48.736]  I'm sorry.
[02:02:48.756 --> 02:02:49.357]  It's alright.
[02:02:49.457 --> 02:02:49.977]  I understand.
[02:02:50.017 --> 02:02:50.597]  God bless you.
[02:02:51.077 --> 02:02:52.157]  I appreciate you calling in.
[02:02:52.277 --> 02:02:59.139]  That FEMA Region 3 and the missing nukes and all of it is just really, really creepy.
[02:02:59.159 --> 02:03:00.860]  And here's what we know.
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:03.460]  The world is in a very weird place right now.
[02:03:04.481 --> 02:03:08.322]  This is a historical time to be alive and a lot is happening.
[02:03:10.202 --> 02:03:10.842]  Let's go ahead.
[02:03:10.882 --> 02:03:13.303]  Speaking of drills, Allen in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:03:14.893 --> 02:03:16.575]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[02:03:16.595 --> 02:03:18.837]  I want to introduce myself.
[02:03:18.917 --> 02:03:31.228]  I'm an investigative journalist with Communities at Washington Times and I want to thank the crew at InfoWars for breaking one of my stories about six months ago about the TSA training for a mass shooting scenario at a checkpoint.
[02:03:32.169 --> 02:03:36.112]  I've also been covering the FBI shooting in Orlando on the ground.
[02:03:36.152 --> 02:03:38.353]  I've got some breaking news on that.
[02:03:38.393 --> 02:03:43.056]  But I wanted to bring to your attention that on September 4th, the U.S.
[02:03:43.156 --> 02:03:46.198]  Army trained alongside local law enforcement.
[02:03:46.218 --> 02:03:48.339]  That was Orange County Sheriff's Department.
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:56.566]  What they're doing is even though statistically one of the rarest forms of death is mass shootings again less than
[02:04:19.999 --> 02:04:26.401]  30 a year from actual mass shootings at 60 something if you count gang related stuff.
[02:04:26.821 --> 02:04:38.324]  I mean, honeybees kill hundreds, but our whole society is being changed and re-engineered into a tyranny in the name of keeping you safe so that no mass shooter can ever hurt anyone.
[02:04:38.624 --> 02:04:40.445]  You're not going to stop a crazy person.
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:52.125]  From killing people, all you can do is make sure other people who want to be armed are armed so that they can protect themselves, their loved ones, and those around them.
[02:04:52.165 --> 02:04:52.945]  That is the answer.
[02:04:52.985 --> 02:04:56.027]  More good guys with guns to counter bad guys with guns.
[02:04:56.087 --> 02:04:59.369]  And it's elementary, but we better get that news out now.
[02:04:59.849 --> 02:05:02.470]  We've got all these points made at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:03.170 --> 02:05:07.633]  Everybody needs to email and Facebook and Twitter the articles at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:12.701]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:05:12.721 --> 02:05:20.305]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:05:20.746 --> 02:05:25.388]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:05:25.668 --> 02:05:27.610]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:05:27.850 --> 02:05:28.490]  If everyone
[02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:30.972]  One of us who can, will take care of ourselves.
[02:05:31.232 --> 02:05:33.953]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[02:05:34.253 --> 02:05:42.058]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[02:05:42.458 --> 02:05:48.782]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[02:05:48.842 --> 02:05:49.863]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.
[02:05:53.385 --> 02:05:54.446]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.

[02:07:10.154 --> 02:07:15.058]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[02:07:15.659 --> 02:07:18.922]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[02:07:19.482 --> 02:07:22.365]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[02:07:22.905 --> 02:07:25.727]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[02:07:26.348 --> 02:07:32.373]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[02:07:32.974 --> 02:07:36.417]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[02:07:37.037 --> 02:07:47.747]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making Supernatural Silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[02:07:48.448 --> 02:07:53.453]  Supernatural Silver Liquid can be used internally, and our Silver Gel can be used topically.
[02:07:53.954 --> 02:07:59.379]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,

[02:08:21.056 --> 02:08:27.301]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:51.096]  We're going to continue with your phone calls and breaking news and the latest on the mass shooting that took place in the victim disarmament zone of Washington, D.C.
[02:08:52.546 --> 02:08:54.327]  They're in the District of Criminals.
[02:08:55.287 --> 02:08:58.789]  We've got six dead in Navy Yard shooting right now.
[02:08:59.430 --> 02:09:03.932]  Up on Infowars.com, cryptic White House message said respect authority.
[02:09:04.612 --> 02:09:09.535]  Navy Yard shooting related to Al Qaeda's call for mass shootings in the U.S.
[02:09:09.595 --> 02:09:10.896]  Curt Nemo asked that question.
[02:09:12.113 --> 02:09:17.195]  We have a continually updated section on the six dead and mass shooting in Navy Yard.
[02:09:17.595 --> 02:09:18.796]  Two gunmen still at large.
[02:09:18.836 --> 02:09:22.037]  That Paul Watson story that he's continually to update.
[02:09:22.617 --> 02:09:24.918]  We've also got Navy Yard shooting right on time.
[02:09:24.998 --> 02:09:27.179]  Gun control advocates blame AR-15s.
[02:09:29.079 --> 02:09:33.701]  This happens one day after Obama starts a new anti-Second Amendment push.
[02:09:34.742 --> 02:09:38.844]  Also, Navy Yard shelter-in-place order leaves victims sitting ducks.
[02:09:38.924 --> 02:09:40.565]  Steve Watson asked the same question.
[02:09:41.045 --> 02:09:41.926]  Navy Yard shooting.
[02:09:41.946 --> 02:09:44.287]  Did gun-free zone enable the killer?
[02:09:44.827 --> 02:09:50.173]  We're going to discuss that with some Second Amendment advocates and activists here in just a moment.
[02:09:50.514 --> 02:10:00.325]  Some of the other news that isn't as sensational as the establishment press pushing tyranny on the backs of the six dead there in DC.
[02:10:00.806 --> 02:10:03.108]  Rain slows rescue efforts.
[02:10:03.909 --> 02:10:11.250]  Among 1,200 plus people missing and they fear that hundreds could be dead in Colorado.
[02:10:11.711 --> 02:10:14.531]  All we need, I guess, is an ATF to restrict the rain.
[02:10:16.151 --> 02:10:20.192]  My point is the establishment cannot protect you and historically won't protect you.
[02:10:20.632 --> 02:10:25.433]  And any big government that's been set up in history ends up becoming oppressive.
[02:10:25.933 --> 02:10:29.394]  Because why wouldn't a big powerful group that's ruthless not make you a slave?
[02:10:30.094 --> 02:10:45.906]  Continuing ABC News reports, Typhoon Manyai hits, uh, Manyai hits Japan, raising fears about Fukushima nuclear plant that's already in the process of having multiple continued meltdowns, uh, and has already flooded.
[02:10:46.427 --> 02:10:54.133]  So, uh, it's the tsunami last time that caused this to happen to begin with, so this is a big, big, big,
[02:10:54.833 --> 02:10:56.215]  Deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:56.796 --> 02:11:01.382]  RT also reports crippled Fukushima braces for Typhoon Manyai to hit.
[02:11:01.723 --> 02:11:03.645]  Again, very serious situation.
[02:11:04.867 --> 02:11:09.829]  Some good news, hounded by criticism, Larry Summers calls up the Fed Chairman job.
[02:11:10.109 --> 02:11:15.831]  He's the man as Treasury Secretary under Clinton who helped engineer the current banking crisis we're in.
[02:11:15.851 --> 02:11:18.932]  A lot of people are involved, but he was in the catbird seat.
[02:11:19.472 --> 02:11:24.374]  Also, amid slow economic recovery, more Americans identified as lower class.
[02:11:25.074 --> 02:11:30.417]  Yes, more Americans are either the working poor or going on welfare food stamps.
[02:11:30.437 --> 02:11:33.619]  101 million Americans on some form of food assistance.
[02:11:34.059 --> 02:11:35.300]  Talk about domestication.
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:39.322]  Big government is doing a great job at the permanent peasant class.
[02:11:39.842 --> 02:11:42.403]  Now they've just got to disarm us and our journey to slavery is complete.
[02:11:42.924 --> 02:11:44.945]  They already control and run our kids in the public schools.
[02:11:46.138 --> 02:11:48.680]  We also have a new video up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:51.881]  Some news is only on PrisonPlanet.com, not on Infowars.com.
[02:11:52.622 --> 02:11:56.104]  Obama supporters signed petition to ban gold coins.
[02:11:56.544 --> 02:11:57.905]  A new Mark Dice video.
[02:11:58.345 --> 02:12:00.647]  They say they should be confiscated and given to Obama.
[02:12:02.322 --> 02:12:10.407]  Again, if you tell people we should take the guns, we should kill the conservatives, we should force abortions, if it's for Obama, people in L.A.
[02:12:11.128 --> 02:12:12.429]  where Mark Dice does these, sign it.
[02:12:12.669 --> 02:12:14.650]  They also do it in Austin in trendy areas.
[02:12:15.411 --> 02:12:17.973]  You could say, we're going to put your baby in a meat grinder for Obama.
[02:12:17.993 --> 02:12:18.553]  They would sign it.
[02:12:18.593 --> 02:12:19.194]  I'm not joking.
[02:12:19.554 --> 02:12:21.155]  We're going to ban water for Obama.
[02:12:21.195 --> 02:12:21.475]  They do.
[02:12:21.515 --> 02:12:22.896]  I talk about cult members.
[02:12:23.897 --> 02:12:25.679]  It's like False of Doom and Conan the Barbarian.
[02:12:25.939 --> 02:12:26.399]  Come to me!
[02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:27.700]  Come to me, my child!
[02:12:27.801 --> 02:12:32.885]  And she jumps off the cliff right down into the ground and bounces.
[02:12:33.886 --> 02:12:35.627]  Steel isn't strong, boy.
[02:12:36.028 --> 02:12:37.009]  Flesh is strong.
[02:12:38.168 --> 02:12:40.650]  We ought to tell the state troopers that they don't need their guns anymore if you don't.
[02:12:41.670 --> 02:12:42.931]  Also, I want to get to this later.
[02:12:42.991 --> 02:12:43.391]  I may not.
[02:12:43.432 --> 02:12:44.892]  I may shoot a special video on this.
[02:12:45.313 --> 02:12:47.814]  I'm going to be doing the nightly news tonight in the commentary section.
[02:12:47.854 --> 02:12:50.376]  So, 25 facts about the Federal Reserve.
[02:12:50.696 --> 02:12:53.919]  Very important for Michael Snyder up on Infowars.com.
[02:12:53.939 --> 02:12:54.839]  Let's get that out to everybody.
[02:12:55.159 --> 02:12:58.602]  Top climate scientists admit global warming forecasts were wrong.
[02:12:58.622 --> 02:12:59.662]  The Earth is cooling.
[02:12:59.983 --> 02:13:01.343]  A giant victory.
[02:13:01.984 --> 02:13:05.366]  I thought Al Gore said we were evil to say such things.
[02:13:05.786 --> 02:13:07.968]  Again, abortion clinics closing at record rate.
[02:13:08.808 --> 02:13:12.330]  Christian Today, that upsets the federal government that funds most of them.
[02:13:12.910 --> 02:13:15.112]  Because, you know, they're anti-racist.
[02:13:15.152 --> 02:13:16.632]  That's why they want to abort all the black babies.
[02:13:17.393 --> 02:13:23.156]  And Israel commits to ending water fluoridation by 2014, citing major health concerns.
[02:13:23.616 --> 02:13:26.457]  So they officially have voted to remove the fluoride by next year.
[02:13:27.838 --> 02:13:28.499]  But not us!
[02:13:28.559 --> 02:13:29.239]  We're going to get it!
[02:13:29.619 --> 02:13:30.960]  And you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:32.461]  That's the Knesset voted.
[02:13:32.501 --> 02:13:33.641]  They're Congress.
[02:13:34.021 --> 02:13:34.622]  They're Parliament.
[02:13:35.778 --> 02:13:43.921]  CVS pharmacies caught lying about risk of high-dose flu vaccines pushed onto senior citizens with aggressive bribery schemes.
[02:13:45.181 --> 02:13:50.203]  That's a Mike Adams article from NaturalNews.com up on Infowars.com and kind of a weird piece of news.
[02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:57.165]  NASA probe hears shriek in space as it leaves solar system.
[02:13:57.185 --> 02:13:59.766]  You know those weird space sounds that the
[02:14:03.482 --> 02:14:06.263]  Sounds like those old movies from the 50s where the insects attack the city.
[02:14:06.904 --> 02:14:07.804]  Sounds like the noise they make.
[02:14:08.584 --> 02:14:09.565]  Uh, so there you go.
[02:14:09.985 --> 02:14:10.345]  Uh-oh.
[02:14:10.785 --> 02:14:12.026]  Sounds like crickets out there.
[02:14:13.567 --> 02:14:16.688]  And aluminum airship of the future has finally flown.
[02:14:17.108 --> 02:14:18.129]  Wild looking thing.
[02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:19.429]  Looks like science fiction, I guess.
[02:14:19.769 --> 02:14:20.810]  We are in 2013.
[02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:21.830]  It's aluminum hulled.
[02:14:22.411 --> 02:14:25.472]  And, uh, thank God it's not run by hydrogen, but it's run by helium.
[02:14:25.792 --> 02:14:27.453]  So it won't go down like to Hindenburg.
[02:14:27.713 --> 02:14:30.114]  But it doesn't matter that they had helium then and could have gone to it.
[02:14:30.514 --> 02:14:31.595]  Airships ended
[02:14:32.632 --> 02:14:33.554]  Because of the fear.
[02:14:34.395 --> 02:14:38.002]  Just like it was very safe to go on airships even with hydrogen on average.
[02:14:38.894 --> 02:14:40.835]  Statistically, extremely safe with helium.
[02:14:40.855 --> 02:14:44.558]  People still won't get on them to this day worldwide because of the Hindenburg.
[02:14:45.078 --> 02:14:46.539]  Same thing with gun statistics.
[02:14:47.239 --> 02:14:52.543]  Statistically, it's one of the rarest forms of death to be killed by a criminal with a gun or in a mass shooting.
[02:14:52.563 --> 02:14:53.183]  Look at the numbers.
[02:14:53.623 --> 02:15:02.089]  We covered the LA Times article admitting gun crime plunges, but the public thinks it's up because of the media engaged in brainwashing.
[02:15:02.589 --> 02:15:05.171]  They know that, but they're hyping it.
[02:15:06.027 --> 02:15:07.087]  Now that's just some of the news.
[02:15:07.447 --> 02:15:12.909]  We have huge news on Obamacare just imploding, but still moving forward like a juggernaut.
[02:15:13.949 --> 02:15:15.789]  It's kind of like a bowling ball dropped off a building.
[02:15:15.829 --> 02:15:18.710]  It's falling to its destruction, but it may hit you in the head first.
[02:15:19.570 --> 02:15:23.451]  And then we're going to get into Chinese broadcast confession of Chinese-American blogger.
[02:15:23.971 --> 02:15:26.492]  And Hayden, the former head of the NSA, is pleased.
[02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:31.373]  He says he wants Chinese-style internet censorship here in the United States.
[02:15:31.693 --> 02:15:34.174]  That's an InfoWars.com article up at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:15:35.194 --> 02:15:39.719]  And the man in charge of the NSA currently modeled his bridge after the Enterprise.
[02:15:39.759 --> 02:15:41.901]  That shows what Froot Loops these people are.
[02:15:42.261 --> 02:15:47.106]  But Google's Eric Schmidt says the government spying is the nature of our society.
[02:15:47.667 --> 02:15:55.875]  But he pays with cash, is very secretive, and has girlfriends wear bags over their heads, like Michael Jackson has his kids, because he's so obsessed with his privacy.
[02:15:58.131 --> 02:15:59.934]  I mean, what a piece of trash, man.
[02:16:00.374 --> 02:16:02.497]  I tell you, these hypocrites are amazing.
[02:16:02.998 --> 02:16:11.230]  Now, for the balance of the hour, we are joined here by folks we had on for a couple segments last night.
[02:16:11.251 --> 02:16:13.774]  I wanted to have them back on the Second Amendment.
[02:16:15.055 --> 02:16:18.536]  The gentleman we have in here with us, Terry Holcomb, was arrested Friday.
[02:16:18.596 --> 02:16:19.957]  Jakari Jackson shot the video.
[02:16:19.977 --> 02:16:32.541]  It went viral and was picked up even by national news because he had a black powder gun, which was absolutely not illegal to open carry, but the police admitted they knew it was legal and said, we are alarmed.
[02:16:33.301 --> 02:16:36.202]  Even though this was supposed to be part of the Texas Historical Society event.
[02:16:37.535 --> 02:16:44.638]  The police said we choose not to have him here with it, even though he's a board member of Texas Open Carry.
[02:16:44.978 --> 02:16:57.223]  And Rachel Malone is a firearms freedom activist and is a legislative director of Texas Firearms Freedom.com, a group dedicated to the preservation and protection of the Second Amendment rights.
[02:16:57.703 --> 02:16:59.044]  And folks, they've got, we're going to tell you,
[02:16:59.969 --> 02:17:00.129]  About
[02:17:18.467 --> 02:17:34.958]  Members of open carry groups are going to be open carrying in front of the Alamo and they've tried to claim that's illegal down in San Antonio but you guys have the land commissioner on your side who controls the jurisdiction of the Alamos of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.
[02:17:35.558 --> 02:17:39.681]  Which my grandma's part of, so it's good to have you guys here with us.
[02:17:39.701 --> 02:17:40.822]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[02:17:41.062 --> 02:17:47.266]  I'm going to skip this network break to catch up on time because there's nothing more important than us not being disarmed slaves.
[02:17:48.207 --> 02:18:03.638]  Talking to you first, Terry, and then Rachel, who didn't get a lot of time to speak yesterday, what is your take on what happened today in that victim disarmament zone on that base where, contrary to proper belief, the military wasn't allowed to be armed because the bureaucrats can't trust them?
[02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:07.852]  And the Fort Hood thing, people weren't armed, so they had to get the police there.
[02:18:09.172 --> 02:18:10.593]  They said that wasn't terror-related.
[02:18:10.773 --> 02:18:14.655]  I think this will end up being terror-related, but just like the Fort Hood shooting, they won't say it is.
[02:18:14.975 --> 02:18:16.056]  What is your take on that?
[02:18:16.076 --> 02:18:18.757]  I mean, this is the reason for open carry.
[02:18:19.498 --> 02:18:27.522]  Here is, for listeners, we can show them on document cam, here is the Los Angeles Times, gun crime has plunged, but Americans think it's up, study says.
[02:18:28.062 --> 02:18:30.304]  At least 49 percent, that's on the low end,
[02:18:31.224 --> 02:18:35.509]  Criminals using guns since 1992 because gun ownership has gone up.
[02:18:35.849 --> 02:18:36.510]  That's admitted.
[02:18:36.590 --> 02:18:39.694]  University Studies, University of Chicago, and others.
[02:18:40.354 --> 02:18:42.156]  What is your take on what happened today?
[02:18:42.176 --> 02:18:43.938]  And then I'm going to get Rachel's take on that.
[02:18:44.279 --> 02:18:49.204]  Well, just today is just more example of what happens in gun-free zones.
[02:18:49.544 --> 02:18:53.228]  If this was truly a gun-free zone, and I haven't gotten all the facts on it yet,
[02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:55.426]  It's partially gun free.
[02:18:55.466 --> 02:18:56.607]  Only police can have guns.
[02:18:56.847 --> 02:18:57.748]  And we know how that goes.
[02:18:57.928 --> 02:19:04.992]  But I mean, I believe that is the intent of our government is to create a gun free society so that only them and the criminals can have them.
[02:19:05.713 --> 02:19:07.694]  Facts aren't relevant to the left.
[02:19:07.794 --> 02:19:09.856]  Facts aren't relevant to this administration.
[02:19:10.196 --> 02:19:12.477]  Facts aren't relevant to anyone that wants to take our rights.
[02:19:13.058 --> 02:19:13.838]  They don't look at the facts.
[02:19:14.179 --> 02:19:15.760]  And the fact is, this is a gun free zone.
[02:19:16.590 --> 02:19:21.753]  And the only ones that are allowed to have them are the police, and yet we still have six people that have been killed, maybe more.
[02:19:21.773 --> 02:19:22.813]  We don't know what all the facts are.
[02:19:24.074 --> 02:19:30.157]  Propaganda is very powerful, and people need to quit paying attention to the mainstream media, because all that is is false propaganda.
[02:19:30.237 --> 02:19:35.360]  Every national study, people believe that there's an epidemic of mass shootings and an epidemic of gun crime.
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:37.321]  And that has to come from propaganda.
[02:19:38.042 --> 02:19:39.002]  It's the opposite!
[02:19:39.803 --> 02:19:40.163]  Absolutely.
[02:19:40.943 --> 02:19:43.825]  The facts, the true facts, the true data, say a very different story.
[02:19:44.731 --> 02:19:48.436]  Um, all the mass shootings in the last 60 years except for one has happened in a gun-free zone.
[02:19:48.596 --> 02:19:50.418]  But nobody likes to talk about that fact.
[02:19:50.518 --> 02:19:51.299]  That's a fact!
[02:19:52.319 --> 02:20:04.946]  And people need to start paying attention to what's really happening and how it's really happening and go out there and get the right information and don't trust the mainstream media and quite frankly don't trust your government because they're not telling you the truth.
[02:20:04.966 --> 02:20:19.995]  Now that sounds like something the founders said and I'm sure you did you see three weeks ago two and a half weeks ago the Department of Defense put out their official training manual for even privates and it says the founding fathers including George Washington would not be welcome in today's army.
[02:20:20.335 --> 02:20:21.316]  There's no question about that.
[02:20:21.656 --> 02:20:22.937]  No, they would be considered terrorists.
[02:20:24.417 --> 02:20:30.800]  And I'm very sure many probably consider all freedom-loving Americans terrorists, as we've been labeled by this current administration.
[02:20:32.761 --> 02:20:39.604]  What is your take on this Rachel Malone, legislative director for the pro-gun group here in Texas?
[02:20:39.997 --> 02:20:46.120]  I think we need to take away from this story the fact that the government and law enforcement, it's not their responsibility to protect us.
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:49.382]  In fact, even if they truly wanted to and sincerely wanted to, they couldn't.
[02:20:49.902 --> 02:20:51.923]  There is no way, and it's not their responsibility.
[02:20:52.243 --> 02:20:57.086]  It is our responsibility as American citizens and our right to self-defense.
[02:20:57.386 --> 02:20:57.626]  That's right.
[02:20:57.666 --> 02:21:07.512]  For those that don't know, under common law, thousands of years, it's not the police's job or the magistrate's job to go out and protect people unless they consciously know something's about to be committed.
[02:21:07.772 --> 02:21:11.054]  It's their job to bring you to trial, to the people, to the jury.
[02:21:11.595 --> 02:21:14.797]  It is not their job to sit there and keep you safe.
[02:21:15.157 --> 02:21:18.459]  That is the opposite of what they're supposed to do.
[02:21:18.479 --> 02:21:19.920]  They're supposed to keep your liberty safe.
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:22.802]  Yes, I think that's a huge misunderstanding that Americans have today.
[02:21:24.303 --> 02:21:29.626]  It's part of the entitlement state, where we believe that the government owes us everything, and so we start counting on the government for that.
[02:21:29.926 --> 02:21:31.127]  It's not their responsibility.
[02:21:31.447 --> 02:21:34.609]  It's our responsibility and right to defend ourselves and our communities.
[02:21:34.929 --> 02:21:39.532]  I have large sections on my website, on TexasFirearmsFreedom.com, just listing out facts.
[02:21:40.152 --> 02:21:45.737]  Of not only the history of the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms, the right to self-defense, but also how guns work.
[02:21:45.977 --> 02:21:50.260]  Statistics on exactly, showing on your screen right now, on guns in America.
[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:56.345]  And how effective it is when citizens have the right and take the responsibility upon themselves of defending themselves.
[02:21:56.365 --> 02:21:57.606]  Go over some of those statistics.
[02:21:57.626 --> 02:22:03.611]  I mean, because you show the graph, but visualize how often guns are used to stop crime versus end crime.
[02:22:03.951 --> 02:22:05.192]  I mean, it is simply amazing.
[02:22:06.949 --> 02:22:10.952]  Right, well I think you can see on the screens of how guns are being used by citizens.
[02:22:12.854 --> 02:22:32.431]  It's very interesting to see graphically on that display there how many times guns are used in self-defense versus the small amount of time that they're actually... Yeah, I used to go off the Justice Department's number of like 24 times, but now the new numbers are 80 times more often it's used to stop crime than it's used in a crime.
[02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:38.778]  Right, and if you look at the effectiveness of citizens defending themselves versus police officers, citizens have a much better track record.
[02:22:38.798 --> 02:22:47.270]  I think if you scroll a little farther down you can see the rate of hitting an innocent bystander, much worse on the police record than on the citizens record.
[02:22:48.220 --> 02:22:48.820]  Well, you know why.
[02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:50.301]  The cops have more engagements.
[02:22:50.321 --> 02:22:54.925]  So they're going to have a much lower statistic, because they're constantly in and around things.
[02:22:54.965 --> 02:23:01.529]  But generally, when a citizen goes ahead and pulls the trigger, somebody's busted down their front door, somebody's trying to carjack them, you're right there.
[02:23:01.569 --> 02:23:02.870]  The guy's assaulting you, boom!
[02:23:03.511 --> 02:23:05.152]  I mean, that's why you're going to have better numbers, yeah.
[02:23:05.692 --> 02:23:05.852]  Right.
[02:23:05.872 --> 02:23:06.653]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:23:06.833 --> 02:23:10.377]  I was very surprised when I first went and looked and took a look at the numbers.
[02:23:10.617 --> 02:23:14.861]  You might not believe this, but about five years ago, I would never have sat here and told you these things.
[02:23:14.941 --> 02:23:15.662]  I didn't know them.
[02:23:16.263 --> 02:23:17.624]  I was not anti-gun.
[02:23:17.684 --> 02:23:23.350]  I just didn't know any of this, didn't really think it was effective for citizens to carry guns to defend themselves.
[02:23:24.050 --> 02:23:25.031]  I mean that's another issue.
[02:23:25.071 --> 02:23:29.174]  It's not just the heritage or how America was founded or the fact that slaves are disarmed.
[02:23:29.634 --> 02:23:46.025]  Once you discover and once you find out that it's the opposite of what they're saying and that anytime they take our guns a tyranny is set up and then once you learn that they know guns are making us safer and want us to live like DC and New York and Chicago, it makes you mad and you want to tell people.
[02:23:46.525 --> 02:23:46.725]  Right.
[02:23:46.985 --> 02:23:58.813]  And so when I went and looked at the facts with a very open mind, actually almost trying to prove the other side, I realized just how effective it is, what a right and responsibility we have, and how important it is for us to keep that liberty.
[02:23:59.113 --> 02:24:10.760]  And that's why I think stories like the stories that came out today, the stories that happened in Texas this past weekend with Terry getting arrested, it's important for us to see those and realize this liberty is being infringed and we must not sit back and watch it being infringed.
[02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:12.702]  We must not wait for anybody else to take action.
[02:24:13.122 --> 02:24:14.803]  We must step forward as citizens.
[02:24:15.103 --> 02:24:18.765]  Now, I never aired the videos yesterday, and the audio.
[02:24:19.065 --> 02:24:21.646]  Most of our audience is radio, probably 95% of it.
[02:24:22.107 --> 02:24:25.809]  We send out video streams to PrisonPlanet.tv members, and later it's put on YouTube.
[02:24:25.829 --> 02:24:29.370]  But for the main radio audience, we should probably repost that article.
[02:24:29.390 --> 02:24:37.435]  You know, the same article that's been up since yesterday, 2InfoWars.com, to the top of the page, so that everybody can go see these videos.
[02:24:38.255 --> 02:24:43.858]  And then I want to get into the whole Alamo situation coming up, and then take phone calls for folks that are calling in about what's happening.
[02:24:44.458 --> 02:24:47.201]  Alex in Kentucky on shooting and ammo shortages.
[02:24:47.581 --> 02:24:50.444]  JD in California, a friend got caught up in an ATF sweep.
[02:24:51.165 --> 02:24:52.546]  We're going to go to Burt in Texas.
[02:24:52.586 --> 02:24:54.308]  Dove hunters near school arrested.
[02:24:55.068 --> 02:24:57.451]  Gary in Texas arrested at Capitol Friday.
[02:24:57.471 --> 02:24:59.553]  So is that the fellow who was in the wheelchair?
[02:24:59.573 --> 02:25:00.794]  I know one other guy got arrested too.
[02:25:00.814 --> 02:25:02.555]  Do you know Gary up there?
[02:25:02.756 --> 02:25:03.016]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:03.056 --> 02:25:06.279]  So we're going to go to Gary actually first here in just a moment.
[02:25:06.299 --> 02:25:07.080]  Then we'll go to Alan.
[02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:10.901]  I'll keep it as brief as I can so we can move this along to the Alamo event.
[02:25:27.865 --> 02:25:36.730]  We had set up with the Texas State Preservation Board and the leaders of the DPS, State Capitol Police, to have a very small event.
[02:25:36.770 --> 02:25:38.351]  We had originally wanted to go inside.
[02:25:40.092 --> 02:25:41.413]  They didn't want to let us inside.
[02:25:41.433 --> 02:25:44.795]  They don't believe that openly carry armed citizens are safe.
[02:25:44.955 --> 02:25:46.796]  I think the Texas Capitol should be a big gun.
[02:25:48.443 --> 02:25:51.766]  It should be the place that is the most free to carry in.
[02:25:52.687 --> 02:25:53.168]  Absolutely.
[02:25:53.348 --> 02:25:57.232]  But we went ahead and agreed that we would have our event outside.
[02:25:57.252 --> 02:26:01.216]  They agreed with us to allow us to have it outside on Friday.
[02:26:02.297 --> 02:26:04.999]  So I showed up and we parked and I didn't get one block.
[02:26:05.019 --> 02:26:06.601]  Three DPS officers were waiting on me.
[02:26:07.662 --> 02:26:10.365]  They had 50, 60 DPS officers spread out everywhere.
[02:26:10.545 --> 02:26:12.467]  They set us up is what it amounts to.
[02:26:13.343 --> 02:26:15.806]  And they intentionally targeted me to arrest me.
[02:26:16.426 --> 02:26:17.548]  There's no question about it.
[02:26:17.868 --> 02:26:22.313]  Before I was ever able to get to the Capitol, I was stopped three times by three different officers.
[02:26:23.294 --> 02:26:26.717]  Now, had you telegraphed that you were planning to carry a black powder pistol?
[02:26:26.777 --> 02:26:26.998]  No.
[02:26:27.418 --> 02:26:29.660]  Well, you know they tap into the NSA.
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:30.281]  That's on record.
[02:26:30.301 --> 02:26:31.622]  The local police even do that now.
[02:26:32.523 --> 02:26:33.885]  I think there's an NSA issue here.
[02:26:33.905 --> 02:26:34.766]  This is very illegal.
[02:26:35.838 --> 02:26:41.040]  According to the NSA it may be, but according to the Constitution, Texas Constitution and the state laws, it's very legal.
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:47.842]  One of the biggest... No, no, no, no, I'm saying it's illegal that they were spying on you and knew that you were planning to bring a handgun, as they call it.
[02:26:48.002 --> 02:26:48.502]  Absolutely.
[02:26:49.602 --> 02:26:54.984]  I think one of the things that people really need to pay attention to is law enforcement is making up their own laws.
[02:26:56.584 --> 02:26:58.785]  We had given them the statute.
[02:26:59.425 --> 02:26:59.985]  They read it.
[02:27:00.706 --> 02:27:01.246]  They didn't care.
[02:27:02.332 --> 02:27:03.713]  The law did not matter.
[02:27:03.813 --> 02:27:04.774]  That's like the NSA.
[02:27:04.854 --> 02:27:05.455]  It's illegal.
[02:27:05.535 --> 02:27:06.476]  Torture is illegal.
[02:27:06.796 --> 02:27:07.937]  Secret arrest is illegal.
[02:27:07.977 --> 02:27:08.638]  They still do it.
[02:27:09.478 --> 02:27:09.919]  Absolutely.
[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:13.502]  And I think people are not paying attention.
[02:27:13.582 --> 02:27:17.185]  I think unless it hits on their front door, they don't understand that it's real.
[02:27:17.646 --> 02:27:22.550]  I'm not quite sure I understood just how real it was until I experienced what I just experienced.
[02:27:23.231 --> 02:27:27.555]  And if it's going to happen to me, it's going to happen to all of us at some point.
[02:27:28.578 --> 02:27:29.839]  Well, it's a monopoly of force.
[02:27:29.879 --> 02:27:32.800]  The government doesn't want its food armed.
[02:27:33.180 --> 02:27:34.981]  That's a lot harder to catch and feed on.
[02:27:35.421 --> 02:27:38.843]  And of course, you're a board member of Texas Open Carry, but you're also a pastor.
[02:27:38.863 --> 02:27:41.084]  You know, a guy with no criminal record.
[02:27:41.124 --> 02:27:45.166]  How did you start now to go down this path where you're an evil, evil extremist?
[02:27:46.019 --> 02:27:52.923]  Well, with me being a pastor, the left, the liberal force has tapped into... They're not liberals.
[02:27:52.943 --> 02:27:53.743]  Authoritarians.
[02:27:53.803 --> 02:28:00.266]  Authoritarians definitely don't want their pastors believing in the first or second or fourth amendments.
[02:28:00.927 --> 02:28:09.331]  They believe we should be sheep, that we should succumb to whatever they tell us to in the name of peace, love, hope, and joy, and whether we like it or not.
[02:28:10.291 --> 02:28:14.474]  And, you know, I believe it's a pastor's responsibility to tell the truth.
[02:28:15.215 --> 02:28:18.397]  And the truth of the matter is, once they take our second, they take our first.
[02:28:18.417 --> 02:28:21.099]  And when they take our first, they take our freedom of religion.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:25.803]  Once they take our first, they take the freedom of me being able to preach the true word of God.
[02:28:25.863 --> 02:28:27.164]  They would want me to preach their version.
[02:28:27.484 --> 02:28:28.745]  And so it's a snowball effect.
[02:28:28.965 --> 02:28:31.267]  And I, as a pastor, I'm going to stand on the second.
[02:28:32.268 --> 02:28:32.928]  They want
[02:28:33.949 --> 02:28:35.189]  It defends all the rest, as you know.
[02:28:35.209 --> 02:28:35.589]  Absolutely.
[02:28:35.649 --> 02:28:38.290]  They want to make the state God.
[02:28:38.350 --> 02:28:38.970]  They say that.
[02:28:39.090 --> 02:28:40.411]  Everything else is evil.
[02:28:40.471 --> 02:28:47.432]  The family, men, women, everything's got to be changed so that we're all homogenized and they can control us.
[02:28:47.952 --> 02:28:53.013]  And our current president was speaking directly to me when he says they cling to their guns and religions.
[02:28:53.313 --> 02:28:55.194]  He has no idea how much I cling to both.
[02:28:56.854 --> 02:28:58.895]  I can't imagine what it's like, because I don't live in fear.
[02:28:58.915 --> 02:28:59.836]  People say, oh, why do you have guns?
[02:28:59.856 --> 02:29:00.476]  You must be fearful.
[02:29:01.076 --> 02:29:01.817]  It's the opposite.
[02:29:02.197 --> 02:29:06.139]  I love being in a neighborhood where everybody's armed, and I can look at the crime maps.
[02:29:06.159 --> 02:29:09.400]  There's literally, like, no crime, because the criminals are all scared to death.
[02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:10.501]  I live out in the countryside.
[02:29:11.161 --> 02:29:11.542]  Absolutely.
[02:29:11.682 --> 02:29:15.126]  I mean, it's so good that I'm red-blooded, and you know what?
[02:29:15.166 --> 02:29:15.987]  Even I didn't have a gun.
[02:29:16.027 --> 02:29:18.189]  My dad brought me up to not back down.
[02:29:18.209 --> 02:29:19.471]  I've been in quite a few fights.
[02:29:19.531 --> 02:29:22.174]  I'm not proud of getting in fights, but I'm proud that I can stand up for myself.
[02:29:22.535 --> 02:29:28.762]  I can't imagine what it must be like to be brought up to be a coward, and if somebody comes to attack you, you just get on the ground in a fetal position.
[02:29:29.042 --> 02:29:30.064]  And that's what they expect you to do.
[02:29:30.164 --> 02:29:35.092]  They expect you to either play dead or ask them nicely to leave, and somehow they're going to adhere to that.
[02:29:36.654 --> 02:29:43.284]  I think it's also important to note that there's a very specific reason that they want to take our guns, and I don't think people understand that.
[02:29:44.025 --> 02:29:45.847]  Tell us the specific reason when we come back.
[02:29:46.167 --> 02:29:51.011]  Then we'll go to Gary who got in, who you know, who was the fella in the wheelchair, correct?
[02:29:51.071 --> 02:29:51.752]  He is correct.
[02:29:51.812 --> 02:29:53.533]  He is the veteran in the wheelchair.
[02:29:54.174 --> 02:29:55.555]  Don't worry, he was arrested though, folks.
[02:29:56.035 --> 02:29:57.616]  Don't worry, he's off the streets now.
[02:29:59.278 --> 02:30:00.179]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.679 --> 02:30:02.280]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.201 --> 02:30:05.883]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.881 --> 02:30:14.484]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:30:14.624 --> 02:30:17.565]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:30:17.725 --> 02:30:22.968]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:30:23.289 --> 02:30:24.950]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:30:25.230 --> 02:30:26.550]  We are what we eat.
[02:30:26.871 --> 02:30:31.193]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:30:31.533 --> 02:30:35.496]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:30:35.756 --> 02:30:38.017]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:30:38.297 --> 02:30:44.223]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:13.519 --> 02:32:17.600]  We also hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on U.S.

[02:33:10.250 --> 02:33:17.173]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:33:17.273 --> 02:33:20.774]  It's not about keeping guns out of the hands of law-abiding Americans.
[02:33:21.014 --> 02:33:23.835]  And I'm sick and tired of people lying to the American people.
[02:33:23.996 --> 02:33:27.357]  We can't have a totally armed society.
[02:33:27.677 --> 02:33:30.561]  We're not proposing a gun registration system.
[02:33:30.581 --> 02:33:32.865]  We're proposing background checks for criminals.
[02:33:33.485 --> 02:33:36.830]  In the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your entire security team?
[02:33:37.872 --> 02:33:39.294]  You'll get right back to me.
[02:33:39.314 --> 02:33:40.095]  You'll get back to me?
[02:33:40.135 --> 02:33:41.076]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:33:41.337 --> 02:33:42.378]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:33:42.679 --> 02:33:43.520]  Mao took the guns.
[02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:44.420]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:46.141]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:22.882 --> 02:34:24.803]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[02:34:25.143 --> 02:34:28.544]  And overall, violent gun crime has dropped 49%.
[02:34:29.244 --> 02:34:30.624]  Other forms of gun-related crime, 61%.
[02:34:31.445 --> 02:34:35.446]  According to the Justice Department, you can read that in the LA Times.
[02:34:37.266 --> 02:34:39.027]  It's also been covered by Forbes.
[02:34:39.727 --> 02:34:46.409]  And we basically hammered it for months after the report came out earlier this year until what you'd call mainstream media began to finally cover it.
[02:34:47.438 --> 02:34:49.080]  We the people are the media.
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:56.969]  And when we see things that are wrong, when we see things that are going on, it's up to us to point it out and not leave it to the quote, experts and specialists.
[02:34:58.066 --> 02:35:00.167]  Who nine times out of ten have been bought and paid for.
[02:35:00.908 --> 02:35:06.851]  It is time for the real media, we the people, to take action and to get involved like my two guests have done.
[02:35:07.492 --> 02:35:14.896]  Now, we have on the line, we've confirmed it's him, we have Gary Hayes who was also arrested this weekend.
[02:35:14.916 --> 02:35:20.660]  A wheelchair-bound veteran for having a black powder handgun, I'm told.
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:22.841]  But we'll get the specifics of that.
[02:35:23.302 --> 02:35:26.704]  And more and more people, thousands, are planning to show up at the Alamo.
[02:35:27.386 --> 02:35:29.307]  Where the police have told them they're going to arrest them.
[02:35:29.367 --> 02:35:36.491]  So a showdown there, ladies and gentlemen, of historical and biblical proportions.
[02:35:36.532 --> 02:35:42.395]  But the good news is the land commissioner is trying to block the police from violating the law.
[02:35:42.695 --> 02:35:43.476]  But what's creepy
[02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:51.203]  Is that they were at a meeting with the state police last week before this happened, and they said, well, you'd be alarmed having teachers armed in schools.
[02:35:51.643 --> 02:35:54.244]  It's alarming to have anybody with a gun but us.
[02:35:54.904 --> 02:35:57.726]  And I tell you, the state troopers, I used to know a lot of them, and I still know some.
[02:35:58.186 --> 02:36:00.247]  Until about 10 years ago, they were completely different.
[02:36:00.847 --> 02:36:03.448]  It is like they're hiring them out of San Francisco or something.
[02:36:03.888 --> 02:36:05.689]  I mean, it is creepy.
[02:36:06.644 --> 02:36:07.144]  Creepy.
[02:36:07.424 --> 02:36:09.525]  And they've said they're going to make Texas a blue state.
[02:36:09.545 --> 02:36:12.326]  And I'm not even for the Republicans either, because they're a bunch of rhinos.
[02:36:12.346 --> 02:36:17.788]  But, man, I'm telling you folks, they're bragging on CNN that they've got Texas.
[02:36:17.808 --> 02:36:18.688]  And I think they may.
[02:36:19.428 --> 02:36:20.229]  I think they may.
[02:36:21.189 --> 02:36:23.790]  Because, I mean, this country is in so much trouble.
[02:36:24.591 --> 02:36:26.932]  And they've imploded California, so they're all running here.
[02:36:26.952 --> 02:36:31.175]  I know a lot of good Californians, but a lot of Californians don't know why they lost their job.
[02:36:31.195 --> 02:36:32.696]  They don't know why they've been forced to come here.
[02:36:33.296 --> 02:36:37.178]  They still want to come here and tell my wife you shouldn't have three kids at the store.
[02:36:37.278 --> 02:36:38.379]  That happens to her routinely.
[02:36:39.259 --> 02:36:42.041]  Tell my wife you shouldn't have paper bags, you know, when you leave the store.
[02:36:42.861 --> 02:36:44.142]  Tell us we shouldn't drive an SUV.
[02:36:44.182 --> 02:36:45.743]  What are we supposed to stick our kids in?
[02:36:46.616 --> 02:36:49.800]  You know, one of your little tin cans so they statistically get killed on the road.
[02:36:50.601 --> 02:36:52.344]  It's amazing what this country's turned into.
[02:36:52.364 --> 02:36:56.730]  We're going to go back to them and your phone calls here in a moment and talk about the Alamo event.
[02:36:56.750 --> 02:36:58.793]  But first, some of our great sponsors.
[02:36:58.833 --> 02:36:59.914]  There's some real scum.

[02:39:05.568 --> 02:39:06.829]  888-253-3139.
[02:39:08.570 --> 02:39:21.376]  Now, going back into the bad news, and this is just like Sandy Hook, the number just gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger.
[02:39:21.516 --> 02:39:24.718]  And we've looked it up and found military personnel
[02:39:25.836 --> 02:39:37.019]  Complaining on blogs about a very draconian anti-gun policy on the base that only MPs and private security could have firearms on this giant DC compound.
[02:39:37.359 --> 02:39:38.679]  I mean, no kidding, it's in DC.
[02:39:39.939 --> 02:39:47.601]  And we have confirmed, and I've got Kit Daniels working on it, that, and I didn't know about this with the law enforcement
[02:39:50.175 --> 02:39:53.758]  Safety Act of 2004 expanded in 2010.
[02:39:54.378 --> 02:40:19.077]  I didn't know that base commanders had been outside of law nixing that, and then a new law passed last year, no, no, this year, 2013, a writer on the National Defense Authorization Act ordered the commanders to stop doing it, and said anybody who is in Army security or any other military security, or any type of other specialist, or any retired former
[02:40:20.467 --> 02:40:23.593]  Specialist in security can be armed on bases.
[02:40:23.614 --> 02:40:24.155]  That's bare minimum.
[02:40:24.415 --> 02:40:28.242]  We trust our military to fight for our supposed country, but they can't be armed?
[02:40:28.262 --> 02:40:29.184]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:40:30.143 --> 02:40:32.324]  And for me, this is a big scandal.
[02:40:32.344 --> 02:40:34.826]  We're going to be covering on the nightly news tonight, all the documentation.
[02:40:35.306 --> 02:40:38.848]  But I am seeing people saying that that was the policy on the base.
[02:40:38.868 --> 02:40:40.709]  We've got to confirm that and nail that down.
[02:40:41.009 --> 02:40:42.169]  But that's big news here.
[02:40:42.750 --> 02:40:47.452]  Because every mass shooting but one in the last few decades has been on victim disarmament facilities.
[02:40:48.093 --> 02:40:52.895]  If you can't trust pilots to be armed, if you can't trust the army to be armed, who do you trust to be armed?
[02:40:52.915 --> 02:40:55.737]  I mean, this is really getting to be ridiculous.
[02:40:55.817 --> 02:40:58.158]  A pilot could fly that plane right into a building.
[02:40:59.013 --> 02:41:05.842]  Now, I've been ranting breaking that down, but 12 dead in Navy Yard shootings, one suspect dead, manhunt underway.
[02:41:07.455 --> 02:41:12.637]  Will they find them in a nearby city and shut down maybe D.C., maybe Baltimore?
[02:41:13.137 --> 02:41:16.038]  Maybe shut the whole country down and search all our houses like Boston.
[02:41:16.778 --> 02:41:20.360]  And notice this keeps happening in disarmed big government areas.
[02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:31.023]  Now, going back to Terry Holcomb and Rachel Malone, who are here with TexasFirearmsFreedom.com, and Terry is a board member with Texas Open Carry, who was arrested Friday.
[02:41:31.043 --> 02:41:35.225]  I want to get into the big Open Carry coming up and go to calls, but I want to bring up right now
[02:41:35.805 --> 02:41:39.227]  Gary Hayes, and we're going to show some of that video for TV viewers.
[02:41:39.287 --> 02:41:42.649]  If you're a radio listener, go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:41:42.989 --> 02:41:46.011]  You can see the free video feed right there on the site.
[02:41:46.891 --> 02:41:48.512]  And you can see the veteran right there.
[02:41:48.532 --> 02:41:51.874]  Before we go to him, tell us about Gary Hayes.
[02:41:51.914 --> 02:41:59.738]  We know you got arrested outside the Capitol grounds with a black powder ball and cap handgun.
[02:42:01.579 --> 02:42:02.480]  They admitted it was legal.
[02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:03.061]  They didn't care.
[02:42:03.381 --> 02:42:04.062]  They're God.
[02:42:04.523 --> 02:42:06.244]  Tell us what happened to him, and then we're going to go to him.
[02:42:06.925 --> 02:42:12.472]  Actually, he had gotten word that some of his fellow patriots, myself and another gentleman, had been arrested.
[02:42:13.192 --> 02:42:18.258]  And, you know, he, of course, he's a war veteran, and so he decided to come down and defend us.
[02:42:19.130 --> 02:42:35.319]  He come down and decided to take a stand and he brought his black powder pistol down and of course DPS continued to make up the law and decided to arrest a second war veteran and this one a paraplegic and they ended up releasing him.
[02:42:36.928 --> 02:42:39.209]  Oddly enough, without any charges or anything like that.
[02:42:39.269 --> 02:42:43.671]  But we're just getting word today that it looks like they're going to go ahead and press charges on him.
[02:42:43.752 --> 02:42:45.973]  So he may be able to confirm that more than we can.
[02:42:46.233 --> 02:42:46.493]  That's right.
[02:42:46.513 --> 02:42:48.994]  They've got to do that because they know there's no law.
[02:42:49.454 --> 02:42:54.196]  So they've got to falsify it and I guess say that it's a firearm.
[02:42:54.216 --> 02:42:55.177]  Because people don't know.
[02:42:55.457 --> 02:42:56.397]  You think Texas is free?
[02:42:56.417 --> 02:42:59.179]  We're one of the only states where you can't open carry a handgun.
[02:42:59.981 --> 02:43:03.302]  And I think they're going to continue to press this issue.
[02:43:03.322 --> 02:43:04.343]  I don't believe they're going to back down.
[02:43:04.363 --> 02:43:05.263]  And we welcome the fight.
[02:43:06.043 --> 02:43:07.864]  I encourage them to try and take our rights.
[02:43:08.304 --> 02:43:09.304]  I encourage them to try.
[02:43:09.464 --> 02:43:10.765]  Show us the tyrants you are.
[02:43:10.805 --> 02:43:14.586]  I mean, there's a reason that we're going to take the battle to the Alamo.
[02:43:14.686 --> 02:43:17.987]  And there's a reason that we're going to bring the battle to the Capitol.
[02:43:18.027 --> 02:43:19.208]  And there's four words.
[02:43:19.308 --> 02:43:20.388]  And they're true words.
[02:43:20.628 --> 02:43:24.269]  And every freedom-loving Texan needs to listen to this very carefully.
[02:43:24.609 --> 02:43:25.430]  Our message is simple.
[02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:26.170]  Come and take it.
[02:43:27.270 --> 02:43:29.010]  And that's what's out of the state, so that's bad.
[02:43:29.090 --> 02:43:30.991]  Yeah, we're not going to give them to you.
[02:43:32.611 --> 02:43:33.911]  You're going to have to take them.
[02:43:35.012 --> 02:43:39.132]  And, you know, just because you say you're a police officer doesn't give you the right to make up laws.
[02:43:39.972 --> 02:43:46.494]  And we have a right, according to God, according to the Constitution, and according to Texas law, to have these weapons and to open carry them.
[02:43:46.714 --> 02:43:48.574]  And whether they like it or not is irrelevant.
[02:43:49.114 --> 02:43:52.175]  And what's happening is police officers are being given
[02:43:52.995 --> 02:43:54.476]  Way too much authority.
[02:43:54.516 --> 02:43:58.700]  I've heard the Austin Police Chief say even if a cop's wrong, their order is God.
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:43:59.060]  That's it.
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:02.843]  Common law, common sense says you don't have to follow any legal order.
[02:44:02.983 --> 02:44:03.583]  That's correct.
[02:44:03.644 --> 02:44:10.109]  The DPS, we talked to the head guy at DPS and he said the buck stops here and I said we're going to order the arrest.
[02:44:10.849 --> 02:44:12.351]  For open carrying of long guns.
[02:44:12.511 --> 02:44:13.812]  And that came straight out of his mouth.
[02:44:13.892 --> 02:44:15.233]  And we were like, who can we talk to?
[02:44:15.313 --> 02:44:17.075]  By the way, they really are delusional now.
[02:44:17.395 --> 02:44:21.819]  They're pulling not just the women in Dallas, the women in Houston over with no probable cause.
[02:44:22.139 --> 02:44:23.240]  They're doing it a lot now.
[02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:26.563]  Where they actually, and we're such animals, they don't even change gloves.
[02:44:27.944 --> 02:44:29.946]  Which is a serious issue obviously for women.
[02:44:30.936 --> 02:44:32.636]  And they're doing proctology exams.
[02:44:32.796 --> 02:44:32.997]  Yes.
[02:44:33.237 --> 02:44:34.417]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[02:44:34.437 --> 02:44:35.317]  These people are crazy.
[02:44:35.577 --> 02:44:36.477]  It is getting scary.
[02:44:36.838 --> 02:44:42.699]  And again, people don't think it is happening to them because it's not on their front doorstep, but it's happening all over the place.
[02:44:42.979 --> 02:44:45.240]  And we just, we've got to look and we've got to rise up.
[02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:47.860]  And then people don't understand what that really means.
[02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:48.340]  That's right.
[02:44:48.361 --> 02:44:48.961]  We've got to rise up.
[02:44:48.981 --> 02:44:50.681]  We also, um, something else I'll bring out.
[02:44:50.701 --> 02:44:53.442]  We've got to look at the actions of people like Attorney General Greg Abbott.
[02:44:53.922 --> 02:44:58.043]  And we've spoken with his campaign, with his office, and we're looking for action from him.
[02:44:58.163 --> 02:45:01.745]  Not just a statement released on his position necessarily, although that could be helpful.
[02:45:02.225 --> 02:45:09.028]  He needs to expose the Lieutenant Governor and the Governor blocking bills that have overwhelming support to bring open carry to Texas.
[02:45:09.690 --> 02:45:10.110]  That would be good.
[02:45:10.170 --> 02:45:13.693]  Also, at this point, he's the highest ranking law enforcement official in Texas.
[02:45:14.033 --> 02:45:17.736]  He can file an injunction preventing these arrests.
[02:45:17.756 --> 02:45:21.578]  He can order the director of the DPS to stop it and to move to North Korea.
[02:45:21.718 --> 02:45:27.362]  There is absolutely a lot that he can do within his, maybe not quite that, but there's a lot he can do within his current... What do you mean?
[02:45:27.722 --> 02:45:32.466]  Listen, if the Attorney General starts hauling in the head of the DPS, oh yeah.
[02:45:32.546 --> 02:45:34.887]  There is much that he can do, so we're looking for action.
[02:45:34.907 --> 02:45:36.989]  Where's Governor Perry with the head of the DPS?
[02:45:37.884 --> 02:45:43.692]  That is, you know, out of all the people that we would have expected to hear from, we would have expected to hear from him.
[02:45:43.772 --> 02:45:45.014]  And we know that he's aware of it.
[02:45:46.095 --> 02:45:53.205]  I am personally extremely disappointed that he hasn't come out and spoke out on my behalf and the veterans' behalf that have fought for this country.
[02:45:54.299 --> 02:45:54.840]  I'm shocked.
[02:45:55.540 --> 02:46:01.204]  Even though I know that he's not a true and blue Second Amendment, you know, freedom-loving supporter all the way like we want him to be.
[02:46:01.264 --> 02:46:01.464]  Sure.
[02:46:01.724 --> 02:46:03.545]  I gave him more credit than I see today.
[02:46:03.926 --> 02:46:06.347]  Well, I mean, I've seen him in public waving handguns around.
[02:46:06.668 --> 02:46:07.088]  Absolutely.
[02:46:07.108 --> 02:46:08.469]  He's here to arrest the governor.
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:19.082]  Right, it's really easy to put pictures out on Facebook of, you know, you, the candidate shooting or saying they love the Second Amendment, but what really matters is... Well, here's the deal, folks.
[02:46:19.142 --> 02:46:20.423]  It's not we're just obsessed with our guns.
[02:46:20.463 --> 02:46:21.963]  If they get those, everything else falls.
[02:46:22.323 --> 02:46:23.143]  That's a historical fact.
[02:46:23.163 --> 02:46:32.986]  But I want to go to Gary, but specifically, for those that don't know, you cannot open carry a handgun in Texas when there's only a few other states that are like that.
[02:46:33.726 --> 02:46:34.387]  Yeah, five.
[02:46:34.507 --> 02:46:36.369]  Very shameful.
[02:46:36.529 --> 02:46:38.371]  But you can open carry ball and cap.
[02:46:38.411 --> 02:46:39.713]  And they knew it was ball and cap.
[02:46:39.733 --> 02:46:40.814]  They knew it was black powder.
[02:46:41.315 --> 02:46:42.476]  And they said, we don't care.
[02:46:42.576 --> 02:46:43.317]  We don't like it.
[02:46:43.597 --> 02:46:44.778]  That's exactly what they said.
[02:46:45.099 --> 02:46:47.502]  So if they don't like how my hair is combed, I'm going to jail.
[02:46:48.022 --> 02:46:48.743]  It might be alarming.
[02:46:48.803 --> 02:46:49.324]  You never know.
[02:46:50.325 --> 02:46:51.906]  I find their behavior alarming.
[02:46:51.946 --> 02:46:53.168]  And that's why we're taking action.
[02:46:53.208 --> 02:46:53.789]  Very alarming.
[02:46:54.668 --> 02:47:00.733]  I was very alarmed myself, and honestly, you can't see it on the video, but I was very afraid.
[02:47:01.173 --> 02:47:04.436]  Now, let's go to Gary Hayes.
[02:47:04.576 --> 02:47:06.297]  Gary was, they said, arrested.
[02:47:06.317 --> 02:47:06.938]  It was in the news.
[02:47:06.958 --> 02:47:15.024]  They arrested one other gentleman, I'm going to talk about him, and then they were putting him in an ambulance last time our cameras left, and then now they released him, but now they want him arrested again.
[02:47:16.467 --> 02:47:20.455]  And sir, tell us exactly what happened to you and where this is going.
[02:47:20.475 --> 02:47:24.483]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, Gary, as a fellow evil patriot.
[02:47:26.087 --> 02:47:27.588]  Hello Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:47:27.648 --> 02:47:29.349]  Good, buddy.
[02:47:29.869 --> 02:47:39.053]  Well, you know, things are changing from every minute, but I was arrested Friday for carrying my black powder.
[02:47:39.674 --> 02:47:42.335]  It's kind of strange how it all came about.
[02:47:42.415 --> 02:47:52.420]  I mean, I had gone to the Capitol to try to gain information as to why my fellow patriots were arrested, and I had talked to
[02:47:53.863 --> 02:48:01.195]  Several different troopers and over the course of maybe 30 minutes to an hour and when I finally
[02:48:02.734 --> 02:48:05.415]  I was able to get them to let me talk to the supervisor.
[02:48:06.815 --> 02:48:16.918]  I talked to him for a good 15 or 20 minutes until he noticed my black power revolver that I had on my seat next to me in my wheelchair.
[02:48:16.978 --> 02:48:20.279]  I mean, I was very careful how I went up there.
[02:48:20.359 --> 02:48:30.322]  I mean, you know, it was definitely put to where, you know, it wasn't displayed, you know, where you could see it, obviously.
[02:48:30.342 --> 02:48:31.902]  Otherwise, they would have already seen it.
[02:48:33.152 --> 02:48:36.173]  As soon as he saw that, though, he told me he was alarmed.
[02:48:37.674 --> 02:48:42.015]  Okay, so now if you even conceal it, and it's black powder and legal, they arrest you.
[02:48:42.255 --> 02:48:45.016]  I mean, it's a club that only they want to be in.
[02:48:45.557 --> 02:48:50.678]  And I think it's shameful they're trying to convert police over to these North Korean Gestapo types.
[02:48:50.738 --> 02:48:54.520]  Now, what about the new news that they may come out and re-arrest you now?
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:49:00.082]  Well, yeah, I spent 24 hours in the Travis County Jail.
[02:49:01.101 --> 02:49:02.682]  Of course, I am a quadriplegic.
[02:49:02.742 --> 02:49:03.863]  I'm not a paraplegic.
[02:49:04.083 --> 02:49:06.104]  I do have paralysis in all four limbs.
[02:49:08.625 --> 02:49:17.651]  They had me in a regular jail cell, and I had problems the whole time because of my disability.
[02:49:17.731 --> 02:49:20.812]  I wasn't able to get water.
[02:49:21.013 --> 02:49:27.776]  I wasn't able to... They basically just threw my food at the door like I'm supposed to get up and get it.
[02:49:27.877 --> 02:49:30.038]  How did you become disabled?
[02:49:31.205 --> 02:49:33.006]  Willard was in a car wreck ten years ago.
[02:49:33.026 --> 02:49:35.807]  I broke my neck in three places.
[02:49:37.288 --> 02:49:39.189]  So that's how I became disabled.
[02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:43.491]  But anyway, they were well aware of my disability.
[02:49:44.711 --> 02:49:58.758]  When they arrested me Friday, one of my concerns was, am I going to be going to jail, obviously, but are they equipped to handle me physically and my needs?
[02:50:00.089 --> 02:50:01.089]  I was told they were.
[02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:10.851]  Well, I was put on the medical ward, which was basically like any other jail, except they had a lady that came around and took your blood pressure.
[02:50:11.471 --> 02:50:12.952]  Yeah, it's absolutely disgusting.
[02:50:12.992 --> 02:50:15.032]  I mean, look, all the criminals are outside the jails.
[02:50:15.452 --> 02:50:17.573]  All the patriots are in the jails under this system.
[02:50:17.993 --> 02:50:21.773]  Are you going to be down there on the 19th in San Antonio at the Alamo?
[02:50:23.834 --> 02:50:25.074]  Yes, I plan on it.
[02:50:25.734 --> 02:50:26.915]  Yeah, I'm not going to miss that.
[02:50:30.091 --> 02:50:33.515]  I'm limited as far as sometimes traveling.
[02:50:34.436 --> 02:50:39.543]  I have to make arrangements because of my disability.
[02:50:40.183 --> 02:50:41.545]  It's hard for me to get out on my own.
[02:50:44.176 --> 02:50:47.178]  You know, I definitely have arrangements to go down there.
[02:50:47.298 --> 02:50:48.899]  I try to go to every event I can.
[02:50:48.939 --> 02:50:49.880]  Well, great job, brother.
[02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:51.781]  We're going to watch this as it unfolds.
[02:50:52.141 --> 02:50:57.304]  The video of you being kidnapped is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:50:57.404 --> 02:50:59.365]  We'll retweet it out at Real Alex Jones.
[02:50:59.385 --> 02:50:59.706]  Thank you.
[02:50:59.926 --> 02:51:06.289]  We're going to come back and go to you guys and talk about what's coming up at the Alamo, then to the phone calls into OverDrive.
[02:51:06.610 --> 02:51:08.471]  For everybody that's patiently holding, stay with us.
[02:51:11.383 --> 02:51:11.583]  Whew!
[02:51:11.824 --> 02:51:12.524]  Nice shootin'!
[02:51:12.724 --> 02:51:15.387]  Hey, that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig.
[02:51:15.427 --> 02:51:16.467]  Is that multicam?
[02:51:16.487 --> 02:51:16.708]  Yep!
[02:51:16.908 --> 02:51:19.010]  Got it from StrikeHardGear.com.
[02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.890]  Strike what?
[02:51:20.551 --> 02:51:23.693]  StrikeHardGear.com.
[02:51:23.854 --> 02:51:26.436]  Set your sights on StrikeHardGear.com.
[02:51:26.636 --> 02:51:30.639]  Tough, tactical gear for your Soviet-style weapon that's made in the USA.
[02:51:30.839 --> 02:51:36.024]  Affordable, plus a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee and lifetime replacement warranty.
[02:51:36.204 --> 02:51:37.665]  StrikeHardGear.com.
[02:51:37.825 --> 02:51:39.507]  Go ahead, pull the trigger.
[02:51:39.887 --> 02:51:49.151]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:51:49.191 --> 02:51:49.931]  This capitalism?
[02:51:49.991 --> 02:51:56.094]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:56.154 --> 02:51:59.795]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:51:59.855 --> 02:52:00.775]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:52:00.795 --> 02:52:02.136]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:52:02.176 --> 02:52:02.456]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:02.496 --> 02:52:02.776]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:52:10.168 --> 02:52:10.548]  Hi there.
[02:52:11.149 --> 02:52:12.209]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:12.690 --> 02:52:15.892]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:52:16.512 --> 02:52:25.298]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:52:25.658 --> 02:52:31.682]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:52:32.363 --> 02:52:33.944]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:52:34.564 --> 02:52:39.648]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:52:40.368 --> 02:52:47.451]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:52:48.311 --> 02:52:53.213]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:52:53.894 --> 02:52:59.776]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:53:00.376 --> 02:53:05.719]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:53:06.099 --> 02:53:07.259]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:53:09.551 --> 02:53:13.013]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[02:53:13.353 --> 02:53:15.174]  So you may know a few things about him.
[02:53:15.454 --> 02:53:21.698]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[02:53:22.138 --> 02:53:27.381]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[02:53:27.741 --> 02:53:30.263]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.
[02:53:30.603 --> 02:53:32.484]  Just visit Go Berkey dot com.
[02:53:32.764 --> 02:53:37.666]  You may also know that the Berkey guy has helped tens of thousands of people get better prepared.
[02:53:37.887 --> 02:53:39.447]  Now here's something you may not know.
[02:53:39.808 --> 02:53:46.751]  Go Berkey dot com has amazing specials and deals all the time on a wide variety of survival and preparedness products.

[02:53:57.237 --> 02:53:57.737]  Again, that's 877-886-3653.
[02:53:57.778 --> 02:53:58.978]  GoBerkey.com, home of the Berkey Guy.
[02:54:20.558 --> 02:54:24.139]  You said you went to the Attorney General's office and they had InfoWars up on the screen.
[02:54:24.159 --> 02:54:27.641]  Now we're here with Terry Holcomb and Rachel Malone.
[02:54:28.161 --> 02:54:32.662]  I'm going to go into overdrive and take phone calls from people that are holding some stations carry it, some don't.
[02:54:33.062 --> 02:54:43.046]  You can go to InfoWars.com and listen to the audio feed or InfoWars.com forward slash show and right there you can find all of the
[02:54:46.693 --> 02:54:58.739]  Video and audio feeds, all of the free apps that are there, iPhone apps, Droid apps, you name it, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:54:59.659 --> 02:55:11.265]  But finishing up the points that you're making about all this and what's coming up with the Alamo situation, it was only a matter of time until the police shoot people that are at an open carry.
[02:55:12.345 --> 02:55:13.466]  And now you're at Lexington.
[02:55:14.619 --> 02:55:19.386]  We were at Concord, and I know Homeland Security's spoiling for a fight with the American people.
[02:55:19.746 --> 02:55:20.547]  It's set up for that.
[02:55:21.028 --> 02:55:23.311]  But it's, it, I've looked at the numbers.
[02:55:23.331 --> 02:55:24.152]  They're going to lose.
[02:55:24.192 --> 02:55:24.773]  They're crazy.
[02:55:25.394 --> 02:55:27.276]  And I hope that they understand what's happening.
[02:55:27.296 --> 02:55:30.421]  But you were making the point there, Rachel, that this is bullying.
[02:55:30.681 --> 02:55:31.262]  Talk about that.
[02:55:31.542 --> 02:55:31.922]  Absolutely.
[02:55:31.962 --> 02:55:32.602]  This is bullying.
[02:55:33.463 --> 02:55:48.167]  Even if the charges don't necessarily stick, even if Terry fights this and wins the case, he's been bullied, he's been terrorized through official oppression, and I'm guessing their hope is that people will see this and back off and stop carrying their black powder pistols.
[02:55:48.267 --> 02:55:54.068]  And that's why you don't see rifles in racks anymore.
[02:55:54.448 --> 02:55:56.649]  The cops come after you even though the rifle's legal.
[02:55:57.469 --> 02:55:59.530]  It's all intimidation and they know it.
[02:55:59.550 --> 02:55:59.831]  Exactly.
[02:55:59.851 --> 02:56:04.934]  The answer is more people doing it and them getting sued, so they get intimidated by liberty.
[02:56:05.334 --> 02:56:09.016]  Exactly, so don't be bullied into letting your rights be infringed.
[02:56:09.036 --> 02:56:11.077]  Look at them harassing the tea parties with the IRS.
[02:56:11.198 --> 02:56:11.698]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:56:11.718 --> 02:56:12.598]  It's all bullying.
[02:56:12.638 --> 02:56:13.679]  They're a bunch of bullies.
[02:56:14.179 --> 02:56:16.821]  And a lot of people don't understand what official oppression is.
[02:56:17.121 --> 02:56:19.923]  The Texas Penal Code has that under 3903.
[02:56:20.063 --> 02:56:26.187]  You know, a public servant, acting under the color of his or her office of employment, commits an offense if
[02:56:27.585 --> 02:56:41.659]  They intentionally deny or impede another in the exercise or enjoyment of any right, privilege, power, or immunity, knowing his conduct is unlawful, or intentionally subjects another
[02:56:42.375 --> 02:56:48.378]  If a cop showed up at a busy restaurant and said, get out of this table, I want to sit here, that'd be official oppression.
[02:56:48.458 --> 02:56:48.698]  Absolutely.
[02:56:48.818 --> 02:56:52.880]  But if they arrest you for your gun, that is felony level official oppression.
[02:56:53.220 --> 02:56:54.580]  That is false imprisonment.
[02:56:54.620 --> 02:56:55.661]  That is enslavement.
[02:56:55.921 --> 02:56:57.482]  That is a civil rights violation.
[02:56:57.702 --> 02:56:59.603]  That is racketeering, because they all agreed.
[02:56:59.883 --> 02:57:01.003]  That was a mafia.
[02:57:01.023 --> 02:57:01.844]  It was.
[02:57:01.884 --> 02:57:02.964]  And they're all sitting back laughing.
[02:57:02.984 --> 02:57:04.945]  They're going to laugh later when we take this country back.
[02:57:05.376 --> 02:57:07.417]  They are, and we are going to take this country back.
[02:57:08.017 --> 02:57:09.557]  The people are just now starting to wake up.
[02:57:09.757 --> 02:57:11.078]  They're coming out of their coma.
[02:57:11.678 --> 02:57:13.199]  Are you seeing that happen?
[02:57:13.559 --> 02:57:15.739]  Oh no, we are definitely seeing that happen.
[02:57:15.759 --> 02:57:16.780]  We're getting more support.
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:17.980]  We're getting more people involved.
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:19.501]  We're having more questions being asked.
[02:57:19.961 --> 02:57:24.802]  You would be surprised at the people that have no clue that we can conceal carry, let alone open carry along.
[02:57:24.862 --> 02:57:29.604]  The average person that isn't from Texas or somebody comes to your house and they see a gun rack, they call the cops.
[02:57:29.864 --> 02:57:34.467]  We had a lady asking Chick-fil-A just down the road here just a little while ago, do you have a gun in you?
[02:57:34.587 --> 02:57:34.747]  Yeah?
[02:57:35.028 --> 02:57:35.848]  You're allowed to carry that?
[02:57:36.609 --> 02:57:37.449]  People don't know.
[02:57:37.930 --> 02:57:40.992]  It's like they live in some bubble and they have no idea what's going on.
[02:57:41.012 --> 02:57:44.854]  Well that's because the media thinks everything revolves around New York City.
[02:57:44.874 --> 02:57:51.179]  I mean they actually, all the shows are based there basically and every show the cop pulls you over, you got a gun, you're going to jail for that.
[02:57:51.279 --> 02:57:52.880]  Well TV is their greatest weapon.
[02:57:54.138 --> 02:58:04.824]  Yeah, we need people waking up to realize the value of liberty, to realize what's being taken away from us, and to realize they can't just sit back anymore and watch and hope that somebody else fights for them.
[02:58:05.265 --> 02:58:09.227]  We need large numbers of people mobilized to turn out for rallies such as the one coming up.
[02:58:09.267 --> 02:58:18.913]  We also need large numbers of people mobilized to make phone calls to these offices, to email, to show up, to be involved in the legislative process.
[02:58:19.093 --> 02:58:22.475]  That's right, they're coming for your guns, they're coming for your First Amendment, everything.
[02:58:22.795 --> 02:58:24.816]  How big is this going to be on the 19th?
[02:58:24.856 --> 02:58:33.360]  Give people the time, down at the Alamo, open carry, and the Land Commissioner is saying that he's going to stand for the Second Amendment, correct?
[02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:34.041]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:58:34.061 --> 02:58:40.844]  He is going to put out, you know, from his office, a public notification that we are having that event, and he is approving it.
[02:58:41.364 --> 02:58:46.047]  Tell you what, I want to hear about this for five more minutes, then we're going to come back, and I promise, go to the calls and then wrap it up.

[03:00:26.726 --> 03:00:30.790]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.915 --> 03:00:39.178]  Folks, this just went up seconds ago, so you've got to hit refresh on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:39.698 --> 03:00:47.202]  Top comments on CNN Navy Yard shooting coverage already calling for complete gun ban and Hillary 2016.
[03:00:47.302 --> 03:00:51.664]  And that's the top voted up of tens of thousands.
[03:00:51.764 --> 03:00:52.665]  It's the top one.
[03:00:53.125 --> 03:00:53.925]  Take everybody's gun.
[03:00:53.945 --> 03:00:57.427]  I'm going to cover this in the next segment and go to your phone calls you've been patiently holding.
[03:00:57.467 --> 03:00:58.468]  Thank you so much for doing that.
[03:00:59.577 --> 03:01:00.858]  A lot going on around here.
[03:01:01.238 --> 03:01:06.903]  Terry Holcomb and Rachel Malone, closing comments in the four minutes we've got left in this short segment.
[03:01:07.183 --> 03:01:11.426]  This is so historical, and I just want to say I salute what you and others are doing.
[03:01:11.486 --> 03:01:19.993]  You are the modern, real civil rights movement, fighting for all of our future, because if they can pull a keystone of the Second Amendment out, it all falls.
[03:01:20.293 --> 03:01:21.254]  It absolutely all falls.
[03:01:21.334 --> 03:01:23.496]  Everything hinges on the Second Amendment.
[03:01:23.896 --> 03:01:24.797]  The right of the people.
[03:01:25.497 --> 03:01:28.800]  And they are trying to take that right to further their own agenda.
[03:01:28.820 --> 03:01:30.481]  They absolutely want to- It's criminal!
[03:01:30.501 --> 03:01:31.622]  They're trying to rob us!
[03:01:31.642 --> 03:01:32.543]  They absolutely are.
[03:01:32.663 --> 03:01:36.266]  And, you know, in closing my comments and then I'll let Rachel finish us off.
[03:01:37.126 --> 03:01:38.206]  We can't emphasize this enough.
[03:01:38.326 --> 03:01:39.127]  Get off of Facebook.
[03:01:39.607 --> 03:01:42.087]  Get off of Facebook and get out there and go to work.
[03:01:42.607 --> 03:01:45.628]  If you want to take it back, you're going to have to physically go do that.
[03:01:46.448 --> 03:01:48.469]  And we're at a pivotal point in Texas.
[03:01:48.809 --> 03:01:50.669]  We're going to either lose it or we're going to take it back.
[03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:52.650]  And what people do matters.
[03:01:53.330 --> 03:01:54.210]  We can't be sheep.
[03:01:54.270 --> 03:01:55.771]  We can't be timid.
[03:01:56.331 --> 03:01:57.691]  We can't let them bully us.
[03:01:57.891 --> 03:01:59.632]  Even if we're afraid, we can't show fear.
[03:01:59.672 --> 03:02:03.433]  We have to go to the front line and we have to tell them we're not going to stand down.
[03:02:03.513 --> 03:02:04.793]  And we can't do this by ourselves.
[03:02:05.553 --> 03:02:10.254]  Um, you know, I'm gonna go and I'm gonna fight my fight for my family and for my rights.
[03:02:10.375 --> 03:02:15.036]  Did you see how aggressive they were to my reporter who was being polite, in his face, threatening him?
[03:02:15.076 --> 03:02:23.038]  I mean, that cop's... He was extremely aggressive and the only reason they weren't that aggressive with me is because I wasn't doing anything.
[03:02:23.158 --> 03:02:27.100]  I was letting them arrest me so that the people could see what was going on.
[03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:28.420]  And then they didn't want us to tape it.
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:29.761]  No, they didn't want you to tape it.
[03:02:29.781 --> 03:02:31.582]  They didn't want no reporters on there.
[03:02:31.602 --> 03:02:35.785]  That was a very, very terroristic tactic.
[03:02:36.386 --> 03:02:36.626]  Rachel?
[03:02:37.246 --> 03:02:37.627]  Absolutely.
[03:02:38.027 --> 03:02:39.328]  You know, we need more sheepdogs.
[03:02:39.688 --> 03:02:41.449]  We need more guardians of liberty here.
[03:02:41.469 --> 03:02:44.412]  We need more people who understand it and study it and know how to stand up.
[03:02:45.072 --> 03:02:50.496]  One thing you can do for people who are in Texas, you can sign up at texasfirearmsfreedom.com.
[03:02:50.536 --> 03:02:51.477]  Join the alarm list.
[03:02:52.137 --> 03:02:58.202]  I'll send out updates whenever we need action, which isn't all the time, but when we need it, you'll have information on what you can do.
[03:02:58.482 --> 03:03:00.604]  And there are folks fighting in all 50 states right now.
[03:03:00.624 --> 03:03:01.185]  Absolutely.
[03:03:01.265 --> 03:03:03.147]  And the enemy knows we're getting the momentum.
[03:03:03.167 --> 03:03:03.708]  They're scared.
[03:03:03.948 --> 03:03:04.549]  Absolutely.
[03:03:04.689 --> 03:03:11.597]  And in closing, October the 19th, San Antonio at the Alamo, starting at 10 o'clock, we are having a Draw a Line in the Sand event.
[03:03:13.619 --> 03:03:16.040]  And then Jerry Patterson is going to be there.
[03:03:16.060 --> 03:03:20.142]  We're going to have 800 to 1,200, possibly more people, because it just continues to grow and grow.
[03:03:20.182 --> 03:03:24.804]  The San Antonio Chief of Police has stated he don't care what the law is, we're going to arrest him anyway.
[03:03:25.445 --> 03:03:28.406]  And we're drawing a line in the sand and saying you're not going to bully us.
[03:03:28.426 --> 03:03:33.208]  And I think everybody should show up, say, at about 945, so just everyone converges at once.
[03:03:33.649 --> 03:03:35.409]  It goes, what, 10 to 2, right?
[03:03:35.569 --> 03:03:35.910]  That's correct.
[03:03:36.030 --> 03:03:38.591]  Everybody converges at once so they can't stop everybody.
[03:03:39.051 --> 03:03:40.951]  I think we should have 10,000 people down there.
[03:03:41.292 --> 03:03:41.632]  I agree.
[03:03:41.692 --> 03:03:44.132]  I can't believe the police chief says, I don't care what the law is.
[03:03:44.432 --> 03:03:46.853]  I don't care if the land commissioner says this is state land.
[03:03:47.153 --> 03:03:47.913]  You can't stop them.
[03:03:47.933 --> 03:03:49.174]  There's not even a law against this.
[03:03:49.514 --> 03:03:51.834]  I can't believe that that police chief is so bad.
[03:03:52.234 --> 03:03:53.955]  Well, he's no different than what just happened in Austin.
[03:03:54.535 --> 03:03:56.295]  They're just being a little bit more sneaky about it.
[03:03:56.315 --> 03:03:56.915]  So I'm going to go ahead.
[03:03:56.935 --> 03:03:57.956]  They're really all feds.
[03:03:57.976 --> 03:03:58.896]  They've been federalized.
[03:03:59.176 --> 03:04:01.558]  And I'm going to go ahead before we close and put Austin on notice.
[03:04:02.139 --> 03:04:03.260]  Expect us come November.
[03:04:03.881 --> 03:04:06.643]  Once we finish the October event, we're going to be planning one for Austin.
[03:04:06.964 --> 03:04:16.293]  So Mr. Schneid, Mr. Ortiz, Commander Ortiz of DPS, Governor Rick Perry, State Preservation Board, just understand we're coming to the capital of Austin and we're coming with thousands of people.
[03:04:17.742 --> 03:04:24.428]  Wow, it's just amazing that Arte Cerveda, the police chief's dad, ran guns into Cuba for those enslaved people.
[03:04:24.789 --> 03:04:29.933]  And now Arte Cerveda is chowing the line with Obama saying, take our guns.
[03:04:30.434 --> 03:04:33.497]  And if we don't stand and fight back, that's exactly what's going to happen.
[03:04:34.031 --> 03:04:37.513]  I mean, I told him, I don't think you're a communist, but why don't you move back to Cuba, man?
[03:04:37.533 --> 03:04:39.875]  Where only the government has the guns.
[03:04:40.175 --> 03:04:41.536]  Or here's what I'm willing to do.
[03:04:41.616 --> 03:04:48.720]  I'm willing to give all those folks the northeast side of the country, and I'll even give them California if they want it, and leave the rest... That's a great idea.
[03:04:48.740 --> 03:04:52.002]  How about if you're an anti-gun, you move to California, or you move to New York?
[03:04:52.263 --> 03:04:54.224]  Let's just go ahead and split the country in half.
[03:04:54.644 --> 03:04:56.525]  I'll even give the Libertarians a third of it.
[03:04:56.585 --> 03:05:00.328]  We'll split it in three, and that way we can all enjoy the freedoms that we so want.
[03:05:02.484 --> 03:05:05.548]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[03:05:05.568 --> 03:05:08.092]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[03:05:17.284 --> 03:05:17.464]  I'm good.
[03:05:47.684 --> 03:05:54.591]  The site is literally packed with audio and video featuring top health professionals who don't bow down to Big Pharma.
[03:05:54.751 --> 03:06:00.556]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired and obese.

[03:06:10.467 --> 03:06:12.528]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[03:06:12.548 --> 03:06:20.153]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[03:06:20.573 --> 03:06:25.236]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[03:06:25.516 --> 03:06:27.417]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[03:06:27.677 --> 03:06:33.802]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[03:06:34.102 --> 03:06:41.908]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[03:06:42.309 --> 03:06:48.634]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[03:06:48.694 --> 03:06:49.694]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[03:07:13.752 --> 03:07:15.413]  Curious about what comes next?
[03:07:16.174 --> 03:07:22.379]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars.
[03:07:22.879 --> 03:07:25.902]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[03:07:26.242 --> 03:07:32.507]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[03:07:32.747 --> 03:07:35.609]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[03:07:36.790 --> 03:07:41.595]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[03:07:42.115 --> 03:07:48.261]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[03:07:48.601 --> 03:07:53.006]  The new Brighter Fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.
[03:07:53.406 --> 03:07:56.008]  Go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKETV.

[03:08:05.636 --> 03:08:06.497]  Faketv.
[03:08:06.877 --> 03:08:08.118]  The burglar deterrent.
[03:08:09.960 --> 03:08:15.024]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:15.364 --> 03:08:17.666]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:30.035 --> 03:08:39.619]  Ladies and gentlemen, I will be on the nightly news tonight in the analysis section with David Knight, breaking down the latest at 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern.
[03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:56.207]  You've got 12 dead now at the Naval Yard, and we are digging up news articles where it looks like it was one of the highly restricted government facilities, military bases, where very few personnel were allowed to be armed.
[03:08:56.667 --> 03:08:58.408]  There has been a bunch of big battles
[03:08:59.657 --> 03:09:24.009]  Over this, in the last 10 years, since 2004, so I guess 9 years, with the Law Enforcement Safety Act, to where basically anybody that's ever been in any type of special operations or police, you name it, even when they're retired, when they're on military bases, but also off of military bases, they have like an automatic concealed carry.
[03:09:25.891 --> 03:09:28.012]  Which is absolutely what you need, bare minimum.
[03:09:28.052 --> 03:09:29.153]  I'd rather just have everybody armed.
[03:09:29.173 --> 03:09:30.214]  Including felons.
[03:09:30.414 --> 03:09:34.496]  Felons are still going to do bad things, whether they're allowed to or not.
[03:09:34.756 --> 03:09:37.298]  Only law-abiding citizens are going to follow the law.
[03:09:37.738 --> 03:09:41.520]  I just say, no gun laws like we had pre-1960s.
[03:09:43.822 --> 03:09:47.844]  And you will see the crime rate absolutely plunge in this nation.
[03:09:47.904 --> 03:09:49.185]  That is the answer.
[03:09:50.851 --> 03:09:53.994]  You know, Hollywood hypes up all this crime in the Old West and all that.
[03:09:54.574 --> 03:10:00.419]  That's actually not even really true, ladies and gentlemen, except in certain border regions with Mexico and in certain periods.
[03:10:00.619 --> 03:10:05.403]  Usually the crime was being committed by the railroad or by big interest pushing people out.
[03:10:05.783 --> 03:10:13.029]  This story just broke up on InfoWars.com by Anthony Gucciardi and it's chilling.
[03:10:13.589 --> 03:10:16.491]  Top comments on CNN Navy Yard shooting.
[03:10:18.073 --> 03:10:19.253]  Top comments on CNN.
[03:10:20.916 --> 03:10:22.518]  Call for complete gun ban.
[03:10:23.238 --> 03:10:26.202]  It's a pretty good headline, but it's been like CNN's top comment.
[03:10:26.562 --> 03:10:29.345]  Top voted comment on CNN, or top voted comment.
[03:10:29.745 --> 03:10:31.207]  CNN top voted comment.
[03:10:31.647 --> 03:10:32.849]  Confiscate all guns.
[03:10:33.189 --> 03:10:34.110]  Elect Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:34.751 --> 03:10:35.812]  That's actually what it says.
[03:10:37.748 --> 03:10:40.311]  This is what Hillary Clinton for 2016 says.
[03:10:40.331 --> 03:10:42.414]  This is exactly... Here, let me talk like the person.
[03:10:42.935 --> 03:10:51.947]  This is exactly what we need to stop hedging our bets and just start our campaign to outlaw all guns.
[03:10:53.618 --> 03:11:06.233]  We need to take the House and the Senate and vote for Hillary in 2016 in order for us to stand up and loudly declare that individuals have no reason.
[03:11:06.253 --> 03:11:07.775]  Yeah, I finally found the voice.
[03:11:08.276 --> 03:11:11.339]  No reason to earn a gun.
[03:11:13.041 --> 03:11:17.003]  People will give you examples all day long.
[03:11:17.684 --> 03:11:22.526]  And facts too, I added, of preventing rape and murder.
[03:11:23.026 --> 03:11:26.088]  But how do we stop the government from raping you if you're armed?
[03:11:26.368 --> 03:11:27.489]  Oops, I added that, I'm sorry.
[03:11:27.729 --> 03:11:30.150]  Let me read the whole thing unedited by me on air.
[03:11:30.170 --> 03:11:31.191]  Okay, let me just read it.
[03:11:31.211 --> 03:11:33.212]  I'm gonna read the whole thing from the start.
[03:11:33.692 --> 03:11:36.713]  Let me just... Let me get into character.
[03:11:37.074 --> 03:11:39.235]  Hold on, I'm almost there.
[03:11:40.590 --> 03:11:41.451]  Work with me, folks.
[03:11:42.052 --> 03:11:42.793]  It's embarrassing.
[03:11:42.853 --> 03:11:45.416]  Don't aim the camera at me when I do this.
[03:11:45.456 --> 03:11:47.017]  Just go to the story on InfoWars.
[03:11:47.418 --> 03:11:48.159]  It's too embarrassing.
[03:11:48.179 --> 03:11:49.180]  I have to do this in private.
[03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:58.090]  Citizen with a gun?
[03:11:59.727 --> 03:12:00.827]  Black scheme asterisks?
[03:12:00.987 --> 03:12:01.668]  Ooh!
[03:12:02.348 --> 03:12:02.928]  Okay, good.
[03:12:02.988 --> 03:12:03.568]  Checkpoints?
[03:12:04.108 --> 03:12:04.408]  Ooh!
[03:12:05.088 --> 03:12:05.649]  Ooh!
[03:12:05.729 --> 03:12:06.389]  North Korea?
[03:12:06.669 --> 03:12:07.549]  I like it!
[03:12:07.609 --> 03:12:07.909]  Ooh!
[03:12:07.929 --> 03:12:10.890]  Okay, I'm getting into the mindset.
[03:12:11.010 --> 03:12:14.271]  I'm becoming Hillary Clinton for 2016 on CNN.
[03:12:14.311 --> 03:12:17.452]  Top voted on an article with tens of thousands of comments.
[03:12:17.492 --> 03:12:17.792]  Here we go.
[03:12:21.773 --> 03:12:22.153]  Here we go.
[03:12:22.193 --> 03:12:23.473]  Now I'm ready, then I'm going to your calls.
[03:12:23.533 --> 03:12:25.334]  Excuse me, it's just hard to channel this.
[03:12:27.580 --> 03:12:28.401]  Look at that person.
[03:12:28.421 --> 03:12:29.241]  They've got money.
[03:12:29.261 --> 03:12:30.902]  I'm going to take all their money.
[03:12:32.403 --> 03:12:35.044]  I'm really an authoritarian, sickening control freak.
[03:12:35.405 --> 03:12:39.807]  I'm going to have a position of power inside the power structure when we totally take over.
[03:12:41.408 --> 03:12:43.489]  See, I'm now flowing the person.
[03:12:43.789 --> 03:12:44.489]  Now I'm ready.
[03:12:44.509 --> 03:12:48.311]  They'll never figure out I'm really a sickening control freak that hates everybody.
[03:12:48.331 --> 03:12:50.372]  All right, this is the top comment on CNN.
[03:12:50.412 --> 03:12:50.873]  I'm ready.
[03:12:51.293 --> 03:12:52.834]  I've prepared myself for four minutes.
[03:12:54.258 --> 03:12:56.780]  It's very painful to channel this person, they're so weak, but here we go.
[03:12:58.962 --> 03:13:15.678]  This is exactly what we need to stop hedging our bets and just start our campaign to outlaw all guns.
[03:13:16.238 --> 03:13:19.762]  We need to take the House and the Senate
[03:13:20.742 --> 03:13:35.833]  Vote for Hillary in 2016 in order for us to stand up and loudly, loudly declare that the individual has no reason to own a gun!
[03:13:36.493 --> 03:13:45.099]  People will give you examples all day long of preventing rape and murder with their guns, but statistically they do more harm than good.
[03:13:45.359 --> 03:13:47.301]  They'll never figure out that's a total lie.
[03:13:51.769 --> 03:14:01.878]  Just because one father was able to stop his daughter from being raped does not mean we should not look at the bigger picture of guns doing more harm than good!
[03:14:02.498 --> 03:14:04.540]  I want to live in South Side Chicago!
[03:14:04.921 --> 03:14:06.002]  I want to live in D.C.
[03:14:06.042 --> 03:14:07.623]  with 14 locks on my door!
[03:14:07.643 --> 03:14:12.607]  I want to be under 10, 20, 30 times the crime rate like Mexico!
[03:14:12.647 --> 03:14:14.989]  I want to die!
[03:14:15.550 --> 03:14:18.573]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I have just successfully
[03:14:19.602 --> 03:14:20.422]  Covered that on air.
[03:14:21.122 --> 03:14:22.623]  Was that not a stunning rendition?
[03:14:22.643 --> 03:14:25.423]  Huh?
[03:14:25.583 --> 03:14:29.604]  Ladies and gentlemen, absolutely.
[03:14:29.664 --> 03:14:30.544]  There you go.
[03:14:30.744 --> 03:14:32.225]  Of course, here's the actual Forbes article.
[03:14:32.505 --> 03:14:35.665]  To deter gun slaughters, the federal government must cease disarming the innocents.
[03:14:36.585 --> 03:14:41.767]  Forbes, go read the article with all the breakdown by Professor John Lott.
[03:14:42.207 --> 03:14:43.847]  Need to get him back on the transmission.
[03:14:47.691 --> 03:14:50.934]  There you go, they picked another area where the general public was disarmed.
[03:14:52.696 --> 03:15:01.085]  And now we get to see a big, grandstanding helicopters, armored vehicles, the specialized cops come and wait hours and then go in for two guys.
[03:15:01.105 --> 03:15:04.448]  In the old days, they'd have just gone up the tower and killed him.
[03:15:04.468 --> 03:15:07.291]  In the old days, they'd just run in, find the guy and kill him.
[03:15:08.450 --> 03:15:10.312]  Again, now it's all about the nanny state.
[03:15:10.332 --> 03:15:19.420]  Imagine the nanny state's all bristling with weapons and drones, going, give us your weapons and we promise to be friendly, like we did in Soviet Russia, like we did in China.
[03:15:20.220 --> 03:15:23.243]  Never mind the Weathermen plans to put you in a forced labor camp.
[03:15:27.026 --> 03:15:30.289]  Truth is, we just want to have your wife in a forced labor camp.
[03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:32.711]  You'll be dead and you know what we're going to do.
[03:15:32.731 --> 03:15:34.293]  You thought the TSA was bad, huh?
[03:15:35.933 --> 03:15:38.954]  You think the Texas State Police doing proctology exams is bad?
[03:15:39.254 --> 03:15:41.014]  We're going to do a lot more, buster!
[03:15:41.034 --> 03:15:43.575]  And when we say gun control, we just mean for you.
[03:15:43.615 --> 03:15:48.756]  And remember, the San Antonio police chief says he's going to arrest anybody with a rifle.
[03:15:48.836 --> 03:15:51.176]  It's illegal to have a loaded rifle on the streets.
[03:15:51.196 --> 03:15:52.577]  He says, I don't care what the law is.
[03:15:52.897 --> 03:15:54.597]  You come to the Alamo, I'm going to arrest you.
[03:15:54.837 --> 03:15:56.517]  I am Santa Anna.
[03:15:57.558 --> 03:16:00.238]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Kentucky.
[03:16:00.278 --> 03:16:00.918]  Thanks for holding.
[03:16:00.938 --> 03:16:01.479]  You're a trooper.
[03:16:01.499 --> 03:16:02.879]  I'm going to go to Bert.
[03:16:03.772 --> 03:16:04.112]  And others.
[03:16:04.152 --> 03:16:05.293]  Go ahead, Alex, you're on the air.
[03:16:05.313 --> 03:16:08.154]  Would you like to hand in your firearms to a simpering person?
[03:16:08.174 --> 03:16:10.276]  Absolutely not, Alex.
[03:16:10.296 --> 03:16:11.156]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:16:11.516 --> 03:16:17.059]  I wanted to talk a little bit about what I see going on here from my perspective.
[03:16:17.379 --> 03:16:22.602]  And I'm glad you brought up the CNN thing, because that ties a little more into what I'm going to talk about.
[03:16:22.682 --> 03:16:29.066]  Basically, what I see going on here is, let's face the facts, they are not going to ban the guns
[03:16:30.385 --> 03:16:30.665]  At all.
[03:16:31.206 --> 03:16:33.007]  They're not going to take the guns and they know that.
[03:16:33.428 --> 03:16:36.851]  They know that they're not going to be able to get our guns because, I mean, we're the American people.
[03:16:37.231 --> 03:16:43.176]  They've taken guns in other nations in history, throughout history, but we are the American people.
[03:16:43.216 --> 03:16:43.917]  We're exceptional.
[03:16:44.017 --> 03:16:45.578]  That is racist talk!
[03:16:45.798 --> 03:16:46.619]  Racist!
[03:16:47.039 --> 03:16:47.840]  Racist!
[03:16:49.201 --> 03:16:49.722]  Absolutely.
[03:16:49.922 --> 03:16:52.584]  I am a racist because I love freedom.
[03:16:53.124 --> 03:16:54.766]  But what I'm saying is,
[03:16:55.256 --> 03:17:01.225]  They're using all of these events, whether they're staged or not, whether they're, you know, propped up or not.
[03:17:01.245 --> 03:17:05.812]  They certainly use them and magnify them and act like a planet just hit us or something.
[03:17:06.274 --> 03:17:29.227]  What they're doing is, they're getting us as gun owners to turn on ourselves and cause these ammunition shortages because we saw after Sandy Hook happened, we saw everyone had to rush out and get a .223 and they had to stock up on... But sir, I think that's a good problem because even though it costs more up front, then people up their production and later prices go down for new people getting in.
[03:17:29.287 --> 03:17:29.907]  Good, it's good.
[03:17:30.287 --> 03:17:30.667]  I don't know.
[03:17:31.108 --> 03:17:33.489]  They're trying to buy up all the guns because they don't want us to have them.
[03:17:34.796 --> 03:17:44.043]  We're still seeing the ammunition shortage, or at least, I don't know how it is across the U.S., but here in Kentucky, I mean, we're still seeing the .22 long rifle.
[03:17:44.063 --> 03:17:46.705]  You can't get any .22 long rifle at all.
[03:17:47.385 --> 03:17:53.750]  And if you can find a box, it's hyped up by like, you know, three times what it used to be, price-wise.
[03:17:54.290 --> 03:17:59.094]  And what I'm saying is, you know, that these manufacturers can't keep up with the, with the
[03:18:00.655 --> 03:18:12.183]  With the demand that they're getting, so the elites, they're using this, they are using this, the free market and the way, you know, the demand goes up to basically
[03:18:13.126 --> 03:18:14.347]  Force us to not have any more.
[03:18:14.688 --> 03:18:17.450]  You know, those of us, I, you know, I stock up on guns and ammunition.
[03:18:17.470 --> 03:18:22.955]  I'm setting on pretty good, a pretty good collection myself, but I was doing it before these mass shootings even happened.
[03:18:23.316 --> 03:18:30.402]  No, listen, I understand that, sir, but I mean, a lot of it is the government's buying billions of rounds of ammo and then doing contracts out five years.
[03:18:30.763 --> 03:18:32.664]  That's the big issue, but I appreciate your points.
[03:18:33.265 --> 03:18:34.746]  Let's talk to Bert in Texas.
[03:18:35.487 --> 03:18:36.689]  And I'm seeing this all the time.
[03:18:36.709 --> 03:18:38.531]  He says dove hunters near school arrested.
[03:18:38.551 --> 03:18:44.158]  I know people personally that live out in Hayes County, Travis County, and the countryside.
[03:18:44.719 --> 03:18:45.560]  One guy owns over 100 acres.
[03:18:47.196 --> 03:18:52.099]  He's planking with his deer rifle, safe berm, whole nine yards.
[03:18:52.159 --> 03:18:55.981]  State police show up and they go, you alarmed your neighbor, I'm taking you to jail.
[03:18:56.581 --> 03:19:00.743]  And now, if your Californian neighbor moves in, that's usually who it is.
[03:19:00.763 --> 03:19:05.666]  In fact, I've got neighbors that have had the neighbors call the cops on them and go, oh, that's the neighbor from California.
[03:19:06.266 --> 03:19:08.908]  They move in, they think it's cheap, home prices or whatever.
[03:19:09.268 --> 03:19:12.271]  You're a quarter mile from them, they hear guns, they call.
[03:19:12.291 --> 03:19:15.393]  And when you get the wrong state police, you're going to jail.
[03:19:15.954 --> 03:19:18.316]  So I don't know this story yet, but Bert, tell us about it.
[03:19:18.976 --> 03:19:20.538]  Maybe you deserve to be arrested, boy.
[03:19:21.857 --> 03:19:26.819]  Well, they had five dove hunters that were out shooting, and school was over.
[03:19:26.839 --> 03:19:31.120]  It was a site that was adjacent to a rural school out here.
[03:19:31.680 --> 03:19:40.003]  It is in the city limits, but the school has got a large piece of property, and it's separated by railroad tracks and from Evergreen Street.
[03:19:40.023 --> 03:19:42.423]  Sure, and a shotgun isn't going to hit the school, so who cares?
[03:19:42.483 --> 03:19:43.804]  Any idiot should know they were bird hunters.
[03:19:44.932 --> 03:19:56.276]  Well, and they had a couple, a mother was walking her kids home and heard gunshot going off and she said that she was sprayed by the pellets, which I'm not sure if that actually happened or not, but that was what they said.
[03:19:57.276 --> 03:20:04.159]  And she ran back to the school, they called 911, and there was an incredible police response
[03:20:05.521 --> 03:20:17.855]  I haven't told this story but I live out in the country and I was shooting a 410 shotgun not this summer but last summer with my son at 10 cans at like 20 feet away
[03:20:19.136 --> 03:20:25.378]  Okay, and I heard a woman shrieking in the property, because there's like big pieces of property, but then small pieces.
[03:20:25.758 --> 03:20:29.539]  And the woman, two properties down, who I later learned calls the cops and all the gun owners.
[03:20:29.999 --> 03:20:33.841]  I heard her from the hilltop going, they're firing!
[03:20:33.861 --> 03:20:35.401]  I hear it hitting!
[03:20:35.421 --> 03:20:41.423]  And then the police never showed up, but I've dealt with this myself.
[03:20:41.463 --> 03:20:41.823]  Go ahead.
[03:20:42.883 --> 03:20:47.485]  Well, and they had been out there shooting the day before, and the same thing happened before.
[03:20:48.670 --> 03:20:50.691]  And the police said, it's not a problem.
[03:20:51.612 --> 03:20:52.812]  They're illegal to shooting out there.
[03:20:53.293 --> 03:20:59.496]  Well, the next day they had a lady that supposedly was hit by the shot and they did a complete lockdown on the school.
[03:20:59.996 --> 03:21:00.657]  They responded.
[03:21:00.697 --> 03:21:02.118]  They arrested the five men.
[03:21:03.498 --> 03:21:11.563]  They've released them, but they're basically being charged with deadly conduct because they were out doing dove hunting.
[03:21:12.182 --> 03:21:18.343]  Well, meanwhile, where's the proof that the woman, I mean, I mean, if she was a hundred yards away, it would, like, feel like he got slapped by the pellets.
[03:21:18.744 --> 03:21:20.104]  I mean, this sounds like pure bull.
[03:21:21.004 --> 03:21:25.885]  Well, and they had local radio personalities.
[03:21:27.206 --> 03:21:27.986]  They were going off.
[03:21:28.006 --> 03:21:34.847]  This one woman, she just immediately responded, just saying it's, you know, it's a tragedy and they need to, you know, they don't need to be doing this.
[03:21:35.007 --> 03:21:37.348]  And they just went on and on for an hour or more.
[03:21:38.403 --> 03:21:40.605]  And, you know, it just, it made me so mad.
[03:21:40.625 --> 03:21:52.432]  Uh, the local Fox 34 news network, uh, had a, uh, reporter out there, you know, and she's carrying on and making everybody scared about shooting near a school and all of this.
[03:21:52.552 --> 03:21:58.556]  And they put on this poor little elementary kid and he says, please don't shoot at my school.
[03:22:01.351 --> 03:22:04.072]  Listen, the Pentagon is involved domestically in psyopsy.
[03:22:04.092 --> 03:22:05.333]  Think of the Pentagon as your friend.
[03:22:05.833 --> 03:22:06.993]  It's the globalists that run it.
[03:22:07.593 --> 03:22:11.775]  And you're going to see this everywhere where they're going to take any event and hype it up.
[03:22:11.815 --> 03:22:24.940]  And my gut tells me, because of the timing and the history of all the things that have been happening, and I don't know how often you listen, Burt, but have you heard me no less than 10, 15 times the last few weeks say, I'm looking for a mass shooting in a military base?
[03:22:26.501 --> 03:22:27.501]  I listen to you every day.
[03:22:27.521 --> 03:22:29.282]  I mean, have you heard me say that?
[03:22:30.145 --> 03:22:30.485]  Still yes.
[03:22:31.105 --> 03:22:32.166]  See, here's my problem.
[03:22:32.226 --> 03:22:36.308]  We don't have time to go back and show all the predictions, how accurate they are.
[03:22:36.868 --> 03:22:40.970]  But I'm telling you, I think this, my gut tells me this is the start of a bunch of stuff.
[03:22:42.111 --> 03:22:43.291]  I mean, what does your gut tell you?
[03:22:43.351 --> 03:22:45.552]  I mean, you can just see, I can just see this.
[03:22:45.892 --> 03:22:48.093]  They may have let a group of jihadis into the country.
[03:22:48.874 --> 03:22:49.954]  Now they've killed them.
[03:22:50.114 --> 03:22:54.756]  They may say, I mean, I've, listen, about half the time they end up saying I'm behind it.
[03:22:55.397 --> 03:22:57.658]  In fact, I'm just waiting to hear these guys were listeners.
[03:22:59.571 --> 03:23:00.352]  I'm so sick of it.
[03:23:00.692 --> 03:23:01.673]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[03:23:01.713 --> 03:23:02.613]  Good to hear from you.
[03:23:03.194 --> 03:23:03.774]  There you go.
[03:23:04.035 --> 03:23:05.896]  Where are you in Texas so we can look up that case?
[03:23:05.916 --> 03:23:06.797]  Oh, I guess he just hung up.
[03:23:08.138 --> 03:23:10.840]  Look up men arrested for dove hunting near school, Texas.
[03:23:13.602 --> 03:23:16.825]  I have had three different people the last two weeks come up to me.
[03:23:16.925 --> 03:23:23.670]  One in a grocery store, one at a gas station, and one at a bowling alley.
[03:23:25.152 --> 03:23:26.733]  And the guy at the bowling alley worked there.
[03:23:26.753 --> 03:23:28.414]  I told him to do a YouTube and send it to me.
[03:23:28.434 --> 03:23:28.955]  He may have done it.
[03:23:29.790 --> 03:23:39.814]  And he said, no, I live on 100 acres family property, and we've been shooting out there since I was born, and we were just out there shooting, and the police, state police, came and arrested me.
[03:23:40.554 --> 03:23:42.234]  They said, you alarmed your neighbor.
[03:23:42.895 --> 03:23:47.016]  And the neighbors have moved there from, I think he said Washington State in that case.
[03:23:47.516 --> 03:23:57.840]  So you get city people move in, you're shooting, well you see the articles all the time where you've got a gun, and you're putting it in your car to go shooting, and the police come, and they go ahead and take it.
[03:23:58.985 --> 03:24:03.008]  And should we start calling the police on cops?
[03:24:03.609 --> 03:24:06.151]  And say, I'm alarmed by a cop with a gun?
[03:24:06.191 --> 03:24:07.572]  I mean, that's kind of what this is coming down to.
[03:24:07.853 --> 03:24:20.163]  This is what they're doing, is they're psychologically creating the idea that our guns are illegal, and that's why they're so mad about open carry, because then that old sheep will see that and go, you can have guns out in the open?
[03:24:20.303 --> 03:24:22.565]  It's absolutely scaring them.
[03:24:25.876 --> 03:24:32.798]  Meanwhile, Drudge reports drug-resistant superbugs, urgent threat, 23,000 killed each year.
[03:24:33.458 --> 03:24:37.659]  Yeah, by the way, the numbers I've got is it's well over 100,000, but that's what the CDC says.
[03:24:38.539 --> 03:24:42.540]  It's over 390,000 killed in hospitals one way or the other.
[03:24:42.560 --> 03:24:44.961]  That's NBC with the actual report.
[03:24:45.961 --> 03:24:48.482]  And again, we've got the new article up on InfoWars.com.
[03:24:50.227 --> 03:24:56.192]  With top comments on CNN Navy Yard shooting coverage, already calling for complete gun ban.
[03:24:57.313 --> 03:25:01.737]  Again, great headline by Anthony, but I'm going to pull Editor here on air.
[03:25:02.017 --> 03:25:08.683]  The headline should be, Top Voted Comments on CNN Call for Total Gun Ban, Hillary 2016.
[03:25:09.163 --> 03:25:10.524]  That's the headline.
[03:25:11.145 --> 03:25:12.206]  Because that's a vote!
[03:25:12.346 --> 03:25:14.127]  That's them in there going, yeah!
[03:25:14.568 --> 03:25:15.689]  Take the guns, baby!
[03:25:16.229 --> 03:25:16.790]  Let's do it!
[03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:19.595]  All right, let's go to another caller.
[03:25:19.856 --> 03:25:21.621]  Solomon in New York.
[03:25:21.742 --> 03:25:22.404]  You're on the air.
[03:25:22.424 --> 03:25:23.367]  You ready to turn your guns in?
[03:25:24.585 --> 03:25:26.387]  Oh no, no way, Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:25:27.007 --> 03:25:39.777]  Listen, just before I talk about that, if you go to the Democratic Underground, which is a progressive propaganda website, it says they identified the shooter, Alan Alexis, 12 hours ago, 34.
[03:25:39.817 --> 03:25:42.279]  Now, this is on the Google search.
[03:25:42.359 --> 03:25:47.923]  If you're researching, type in right now, Aaron Alexis, 34, Texas, Democratic Underground.
[03:25:48.304 --> 03:25:50.966]  The time stands before you click the link in Google.
[03:25:51.886 --> 03:25:52.907]  Pull it up, pull it up.
[03:25:53.887 --> 03:25:55.348]  Our word is Aaron Alexis.
[03:25:56.448 --> 03:26:00.310]  Yeah, A-A-R-O-N-A-L-E-X-I-S.
[03:26:00.390 --> 03:26:02.671]  So I have 34 Texas Democratic on the ground.
[03:26:03.191 --> 03:26:05.232]  This is 12 hours ago on the Google search.
[03:26:06.552 --> 03:26:07.152]  Amazing.
[03:26:07.633 --> 03:26:10.094]  In fact, we have it.
[03:26:10.114 --> 03:26:10.654]  You guys have it?
[03:26:10.674 --> 03:26:11.054]  Pull it up.
[03:26:12.555 --> 03:26:13.115]  There it is.
[03:26:13.135 --> 03:26:17.176]  Aaron Alexis, 34, identified a shooter at Navy Yard 12 hours ago.
[03:26:20.382 --> 03:26:23.504]  I'm getting a bunch of calls, everybody thinks it's fake again, and
[03:26:47.765 --> 03:27:10.525]  Let me tell you, when the Pentagon announced a month and a half ago they're going to engage in domestic PSYOPs against us, this is a known Pentagon PSYOP to commit mass shootings at military bases, and it said fake some of the shootings, but even have volunteers be wounded, but then kill civilians outside, this is all in Northwoods, to then create the fear to take the liberty.
[03:27:11.719 --> 03:27:20.208]  Hitler dressed up Jewish concentration camp people in Polish uniforms and German uniforms and shot them for newsreels.
[03:27:20.648 --> 03:27:23.831]  That was Operation Hemler at Glywoods in 1939.
[03:27:23.891 --> 03:27:29.217]  So yeah, this is a, I mean, the fact is, this has been done over and over again.
[03:27:29.257 --> 03:27:31.099]  And you know, Paul Watson, I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:27:32.591 --> 03:27:37.015]  He tweets on Real Alex Jones, and I think Paul's smarter than me in many ways, so I'm not knocking him.
[03:27:37.635 --> 03:27:40.737]  But I knew the criticism I would get as soon as I saw this.
[03:27:41.118 --> 03:27:49.805]  Here's Twitchy, and it says, bring on the derp, conspiracy douche Alex Jones doesn't know how breaking news works.
[03:27:50.345 --> 03:27:51.326]  And of course, yes we do.
[03:27:51.446 --> 03:27:54.448]  Watson was asking the question, because they have been changing it a lot.
[03:27:55.049 --> 03:27:58.932]  He said, why did the Washington Post originally report three shooters, now only one?
[03:28:00.970 --> 03:28:02.732]  Well, yeah, and then they also said two.
[03:28:02.792 --> 03:28:03.893]  Now they're saying three again.
[03:28:03.913 --> 03:28:06.857]  And then they make fun of us going, because news changes.
[03:28:06.897 --> 03:28:20.792]  Yeah, but you also got to watch it, because they'll change it and try to cover it up, like the drill they admitted they were having on 7-7 in London and at the Boston bombing and other events, which they then denied and we later confirmed they did have.
[03:28:20.852 --> 03:28:22.033]  See, sometimes
[03:28:22.694 --> 03:28:25.075]  It's not just because they're getting news reporting wrong.
[03:28:25.435 --> 03:28:28.196]  It's because key stuff is coming out early, dummies.
[03:28:28.516 --> 03:28:32.118]  So maybe it's you that doesn't know about news reporting.
[03:28:32.358 --> 03:28:34.819]  You know about reporting on Twitter all day, which is fine.
[03:28:35.739 --> 03:28:41.101]  But, you know, no need, no need to get jealous of InfoWars.com.
[03:28:41.121 --> 03:28:44.443]  Just wait till we re-up and redesign the site, which is coming soon.
[03:28:44.503 --> 03:28:45.143]  You'll really hate us.
[03:28:46.932 --> 03:28:50.134]  So again, that's some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:28:50.394 --> 03:28:52.435]  Real fast, Jeffrey in Connecticut.
[03:28:52.955 --> 03:28:53.935]  You think it might be faked?
[03:28:53.955 --> 03:28:54.916]  A lot of folks are saying it.
[03:28:55.956 --> 03:29:04.840]  Yeah, I do, because it's... I don't know, like a lot of the news that I see right now is this... It seems so fake, and then, like, they'll change it.
[03:29:04.880 --> 03:29:07.462]  Like, first it was one shooter, then it was two, then it was three.
[03:29:08.022 --> 03:29:08.962]  Then they said four.
[03:29:08.982 --> 03:29:12.464]  Then they, like, ID'd one person and said he wasn't the shooter.
[03:29:12.504 --> 03:29:15.065]  So it's like, how... This is like CNN.
[03:29:15.105 --> 03:29:16.526]  How can you mess up the news like that?
[03:29:19.537 --> 03:29:26.061]  Well, look, CNN has been caught doing fake newscasts from Atlanta that they said were in Iraq before under nerve gas attack.
[03:29:26.601 --> 03:29:33.746]  And they sent a live feed out, not on the TV, but a live feed that could be picked up by satellite dishes of them making jokes about it.
[03:29:33.786 --> 03:29:34.626]  I mean, it's confirmed.
[03:29:34.686 --> 03:29:36.748]  So, yes, they've been caught lying before.
[03:29:37.208 --> 03:29:38.348]  They do lie all the time.
[03:29:38.388 --> 03:29:39.629]  They distort reality.
[03:29:39.909 --> 03:29:41.029]  So the whole thing could be fake.
[03:29:41.049 --> 03:29:44.430]  But regardless, you're going to think these 12 dead is the end of the world.
[03:29:44.810 --> 03:29:49.031]  So who cares about thousands missing in Colorado by the time they're done with it?
[03:29:49.271 --> 03:29:53.112]  The mind control is the hyping something that's so incredibly rare.
[03:29:53.733 --> 03:29:55.073]  But they're coming after our guns.
[03:29:55.793 --> 03:29:58.234]  And Obama says 80% of you support it, even though you don't.
[03:29:59.154 --> 03:30:00.054]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.554 --> 03:30:02.155]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.075 --> 03:30:05.756]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.017 --> 03:30:14.599]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[03:30:14.740 --> 03:30:17.701]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[03:30:17.861 --> 03:30:23.084]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[03:30:23.424 --> 03:30:25.085]  It all comes down to one thing.
[03:30:25.365 --> 03:30:26.626]  We are what we eat.
[03:30:26.986 --> 03:30:31.308]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[03:30:31.649 --> 03:30:35.631]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[03:30:35.871 --> 03:30:38.192]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[03:30:38.432 --> 03:30:44.355]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
