[00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:18.216]  In part one of this report, we looked at the danger of catastrophic failures, not only from nuclear reactors, but from spent fuel pools.
[00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:22.459]  Tonight, we're going to look at the end-of-life issues with nuclear power.
[00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.740]  Storage, decommissioning of power plants.
[00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:32.486]  This is the most delicate part of the whole operation, as it involves reopening the building without contaminating the area or staff on the outside.
[00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:38.710]  Not including the reactor building would generate 30,500 tons of waste in need of special treatment.
[00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.732]  But the figures remain questionable.
[00:00:41.232 --> 00:00:46.039]  The OECD cites 36,000 tonnes for the total shutdown of a power plant.
[00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:49.965]  Up until now, no site has been entirely dismantled.
[00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:53.611]  Depending on the method chosen, the process can take between 25 and 100 years.
[00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.602]  Plants are just now starting to be shut down after about 40 years of operation.
[00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:05.205]  But others are having their licenses extended with little or no public examination.
[00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:14.432]  Sharon Harris near Raleigh, North Carolina has just had its license extended in spite of signs of aging and many troubles at that location.
[00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:20.417]  Between 1999 and 2003, there were 12 major problems requiring the shutdown of the plant.
[00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:25.762]  That's an average of once every four months, as opposed to the industry average of once every 18 months.
[00:01:26.262 --> 00:01:29.085]  Four and a half times the shutdowns as the industry average.
[00:01:29.505 --> 00:01:35.651]  In May of this year, the plant was shut down by the NRC for a couple of weeks when a quarter-inch crack was found inside the reactor pressure vessel head.
[00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:40.175]  In August, an explosion of electrical equipment caused the plant to be shut down.
[00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:47.802]  One week later, the same nuclear power plant was found to have a leaking valve that had released at least 10,000 gallons of radioactive water.
[00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:52.867]  But in spite of that history, Sharon Harris asked for and got a 20-year extension.
[00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:56.390]  That means that it has a license to run for 60 years.
[00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:58.733]  No nuclear power plant has done that.
[00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:03.774]  We're dealing with really old reactors, and they have to be decommissioned.
[00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:15.258]  If we were to follow the advice of the former chair of the NRC and shut down all the nuclear reactors, we would still have a legacy of dangerous materials from the decommissioned plants and spent fuel that threatens life on Earth.
[00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:27.061]  Catastrophic reactor failure during operation, radiation leaks during operation, catastrophic spent fuel fires, and pushing the storage of dangerous waste onto future generations for centuries or millennia,
[00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:31.282]  Yet, Obama wants to shut down all coal plants and go nuclear.
[00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:37.063]  In the next installment, we'll look at the global warming narrative and Obama's love affair with nuclear.
