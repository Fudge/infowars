[00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:02.681]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.386]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:16.990]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.570]  You want answers?
[00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.111]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:24.312]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:28.394]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:57.106]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones, and I want to thank you for joining us here today.
[00:00:57.106 --> 00:01:16.701]  The magnitude of the information that we're going to be covering is undoubtedly the most off-the-chart, out-in-the-open false flag event
[00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:20.168]  That I have personally ever seen.
[00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:29.590]  We have caught them red-handed and we're going to be analyzing and breaking all of this down today.
[00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:40.952]  This is all coming up here on the broadcast.
[00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:44.513]  I am going to attempt as best I can after the break when we come back
[00:01:48.413 --> 00:02:05.299]  to go over all the different facets of this but we saw a massive cover-up yesterday within five minutes of us announcing we had the photos and videos of what looked like Navy SEALs along with what looked like Saudi Arabians and what looked like good old boy Patsy's they were preparing to set up all the black backpacks
[00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:10.664]  CNN looked completely panicked during the break and said, oh, now there's been an arrest.
[00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.746]  There's going to be a press conference at 5.
[00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:20.815]  But then they figured out, wait, now when we show the photos that Jones has, then everyone's going to say, well, what about all these other people?
[00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:23.238]  And I even predicted on air, because I know how they operate,
[00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:37.343]  I even predicted on air that they would then cancel the press conference and be put into disarray because they have to now go to another plant.
[00:02:37.343 --> 00:02:38.283]  I want to explain something.
[00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:51.031]  You've got guys with Navy SEAL hats on that look like Navy SEALs, with police, before and after the bombing, right up at the finish line, right next to Saudi Arabians with black backpacks, what look like Saudi Arabians, and good old boys with backpacks.
[00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:54.663]  And you've got them saying, remain calm.
[00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:55.943]  We have witnesses that have proven that.
[00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:59.664]  We know there was a drill they were using to cover this up.
[00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:05.527]  The Navy SEALs are standing around like they don't know what to do and they've got their black bags on their phones waiting to be told what to do.
[00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:07.027]  They were just there to add confusion.
[00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:11.329]  I am not accusing the Navy SEALs of being involved in this.
[00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.370]  This is how standard operating procedure goes for criminal networks.
[00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.911]  They call a drill from the top, the agencies show up,
[00:03:19.318 --> 00:03:27.104]  So that if their own operatives within get caught, they just say, oh, it's part of the larger drill.
[00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:29.906]  So all of that and more is coming up today.
[00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:37.412]  You had an emergency meeting with the Saudi foreign minister and Obama that was not on the schedule with all sorts of sedans pulling up and freaking out.
[00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:40.755]  You had them talking about deporting a Saudi who was arrested.
[00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:41.596]  Oh, he's a suspect.
[00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:42.336]  We're going to deport him.
[00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:42.697]  Let's not.
[00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:59.115]  And now you've got Janet Napolitano, here's the big news coming out this morning, and the FBI, and saying, okay, here's the photos of, they're not suspects, because, you know, they actually catch them, they don't, and they want to just whitewash it and say, oh, they're not suspects, with black backpacks, right where the backpacks were left, minutes before the bombing.
[00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:02.089]  No, they're not suspects, she said before Congress.
[00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.791]  But we do want your help finding them.
[00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:07.072]  This is almost a day after we show it.
[00:04:07.072 --> 00:04:09.413]  We say, that's the main suspects.
[00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:11.534]  And of course, I got attacked by neocons.
[00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:13.315]  I'm not going to give them any attention.
[00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:14.515]  But you know who they are.
[00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:15.696]  That I'm crazy.
[00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:19.238]  Yeah, I'm crazy like a big old red fox with a white tail, buddy.
[00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:21.238]  Yeah, that's how crazy I am.
[00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:24.179]  I mean, this is 2 plus 2 equals 4, though.
[00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:25.420]  I mean, mama didn't raise a fool.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.323]  I didn't fall off a turnip truck last... I was born in the dark, but it wasn't last night.
[00:04:29.323 --> 00:04:31.144]  Every other old Texas clichÃ©.
[00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:34.125]  But this is a no-brainer if you study false flags, staged events.
[00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:41.250]  By the way, Adan Salazar has an article going up at InfoWars.com showing the analytics from Google on false flag.
[00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.693]  It is one of the top terms in America right now, people looking up what a false flag is.
[00:04:47.293 --> 00:04:50.116]  Harry Reid freaked out and said, how dare you say it's a false flag?
[00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:51.418]  They're panicking.
[00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:55.022]  They know more and more people are looking at them.
[00:04:55.022 --> 00:05:03.451]  And I was just watching the governor and all them soaking up, like acting like rock stars, loving the attention right now at the memorial service.
[00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:05.113]  It's truly disgusting.
[00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:16.347]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:05:16.347 --> 00:05:20.028]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:24.490]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.191]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:10.042]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:15.066]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:22.252]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:07:22.372 --> 00:07:27.997]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[00:08:04.087 --> 00:08:04.747]  Are you?
[00:08:04.747 --> 00:08:05.548]  InfoWarshop.com
[00:08:10.578 --> 00:08:14.163]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:14.163 --> 00:08:18.269]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:46.296]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 18th day, the day before the real Patriots day, the day before Lexington and Concord, and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:08:46.296 --> 00:08:50.397]  I am your guest, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:52.398]  We do have some guests coming up.
[00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:56.719]  Max Keiser is going to be joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:08:58.556 --> 00:09:15.080]  And we are going to be breaking down all of the massive news that has been unfolding on the Second Amendment front with the fertilizer factory up by Waco exploding spectacularly and killing between 10 and 70 people.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.520]  There's different numbers coming out.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.642]  Incidentally, there's a big statewide drill going on yesterday and today there with helicopters and ambulances and everything at the nearby hospital.
[00:09:25.402 --> 00:09:29.384]  But probably just fertilizer catching on fire and exploding.
[00:09:29.384 --> 00:09:43.793]  So all of this is obviously important, but the magnitude of what we are about to cover here today is of undoubtedly, undoubtedly is the culmination of 18 years of my work.
[00:09:43.793 --> 00:09:46.075]  So far, this is the culmination.
[00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:50.818]  This is everything we've been working towards, everything we've been building towards, to have a platform
[00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:56.857]  To be able to expose false flag staged events when they happen.
[00:09:56.857 --> 00:10:03.845]  That is everything that I have been working for.
[00:10:03.845 --> 00:10:04.726]  As hard as I can.
[00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:18.644]  And that's why I've been criticized so much because power structures out there want to be able to provocateur events, wind up patsies, wind up mentally ill people, stage events, allow events to happen.
[00:10:18.644 --> 00:10:20.286]  There's different types.
[00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:26.733]  And even though this is a historical well-known fact and is in mainline, you know, history books on intelligence operations.
[00:10:28.012 --> 00:10:32.273]  Operation Gladio, Ajax, Gulf of Tonkin, Northwoods, the list goes on and on.
[00:10:32.273 --> 00:10:37.695]  The NATO option, Hitler and the Reichstag, Operation Himmler, Operation Gleiwitz.
[00:10:37.695 --> 00:10:39.895]  Gleiwitz was part of Operation Himmler.
[00:10:39.895 --> 00:10:40.776]  I mean, look this up.
[00:10:40.776 --> 00:10:44.957]  There's Pulitzer Prize winning books on Nuremberg about this.
[00:10:44.957 --> 00:10:48.598]  Scherer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, you may have heard of it.
[00:10:48.598 --> 00:10:52.879]  And I get up here and say, hey, this is what goes on, this is what happens.
[00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:55.240]  So, I think the best way to go over this today
[00:10:57.073 --> 00:11:00.597]  That is the start of the beginning of what happened.
[00:11:00.597 --> 00:11:04.140]  Anonymous, and that's all they want to be known as.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:15.091]  Anonymous has contacted us as well, and it is the, I mean a real group affiliated with the White Hat, Anonymous, and said have you seen this data dump of photos and videos?
[00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:15.832]  This shows
[00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:24.050]  What appears to be Navy SEALs, and that was in one of their data dumps I hadn't even gotten to yet, and I saw it was Navy SEALs.
[00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:35.120]  And it shows what looks like Saudi Nationals, and it shows what looks like the Patsy's, and sure enough, it's dead on analysis, it shows the redneck Patsy's.
[00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:38.360]  And that's how intelligence operations work.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:50.328]  The Feds had Iraqis, they had German intelligence, they had special forces people like McVeigh, and all this was caught on 17 surveillance cameras.
[00:11:50.328 --> 00:12:03.037]  And later, FBI agents went public on the LA Times and said, we've seen the confiscated 17 VHS tapes from the surrounding YMCA and others, and the one from the Federal Building right above the Ryder truck.
[00:12:03.037 --> 00:12:04.418]  It was McVeigh with six other men.
[00:12:05.342 --> 00:12:10.026]  And then we've identified who those six other men are by name.
[00:12:10.026 --> 00:12:10.627]  By name.
[00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:16.392]  Justice Department, ATF people, and a famous German intelligence agent of their counter-terrorism unit.
[00:12:17.244 --> 00:12:24.910]  Who was then positively identified by police officers we've interviewed, and Jane Graham, who was also in HUD, and actually saw them planting bombs.
[00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.914]  Because she would use one of the side entrances for exercise to go up the stairs.
[00:12:29.914 --> 00:12:31.275]  But we've had her on before.
[00:12:31.275 --> 00:12:33.837]  The point is, she would use the stairs to go in and out.
[00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:36.199]  And the day before, saw them planting the gray butter.
[00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:38.041]  And they're like, oh, we're just doing some phone work.
[00:12:38.041 --> 00:12:42.624]  And she was struck by how handsome one particular gentleman was.
[00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:59.119]  uh... in the black cowboy hat that's why she locked eyes with him for uh... you know quite a bit she was thunderstruck uh... i mean women are attracted to powerful aggressive men and so she was she was kinda thunderstruck and really locked on and they're like you can go on now honey
[00:13:00.438 --> 00:13:02.879]  We got something for you tomorrow, though.
[00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:07.361]  And again, we know the names, we know who the people are.
[00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:09.902]  The FBI came in to Don Browning, the head of the K-9 unit.
[00:13:09.902 --> 00:13:15.864]  He was one of the officers that first responded and said, you and your wife are going to get killed if you don't shut your fat mouth, Browning.
[00:13:16.724 --> 00:13:20.586]  Of course, Terrence Yakey, cop of the year, he saved a bunch of people.
[00:13:20.586 --> 00:13:22.867]  Big black, you know, linebacker guy.
[00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:25.208]  Carried him out on his back.
[00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:26.308]  They killed him.
[00:13:26.308 --> 00:13:28.329]  And he called his partner and said, I got feds behind me.
[00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:30.790]  You know, I'll see you back at the storage shed.
[00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.711]  I've got the material.
[00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:38.954]  And they told Yakey, I've talked to his family, they said, we're going to kill you if you don't shut up.
[00:13:38.954 --> 00:13:40.514]  And they tortured him really bad.
[00:13:40.514 --> 00:13:41.195]  Tortured him to death.
[00:13:42.415 --> 00:13:46.701]  And of course, that's the Justice Department, that's basically the same people that are in charge today.
[00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:50.205]  And they're not playing games, so let me explain something.
[00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:58.477]  What we're covering here is unprecedented in American history, because of the high technology we've got now, they're still following an old game plan.
[00:14:00.063 --> 00:14:01.264]  And I want to explain something.
[00:14:01.264 --> 00:14:03.425]  They monitor this show, that's on record.
[00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:09.869]  Five minutes after we broke this yesterday at noon central, high noon, I walked out and had three TVs on.
[00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:12.890]  Two in here and one in the pantry, in the break room.
[00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:22.016]  And I watched CNN and MSNBC, the reporters while their guests were talking, getting messages in their ears.
[00:14:22.016 --> 00:14:24.097]  And I saw the adrenaline rush, like when you
[00:14:25.883 --> 00:14:41.109]  Catch burglars in your house or something and I knew what was about to come out of their mouth and I ran back in here I said watch this And I knew what they were gonna say next out of their mouth because live time they were listening to us is five minutes later and blitzer goes There's now they've now arrested a suspect and they've got photos.
[00:14:41.109 --> 00:14:44.771]  They're gonna be releasing photos Very soon and I went on air.
[00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:46.691]  I said, I just saw him freak out.
[00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:50.013]  They're going to release photos But I said if they're smart
[00:14:51.132 --> 00:14:52.013]  I guess they were listening to that.
[00:14:52.013 --> 00:14:55.356]  They actually won't, because now we're going to be able to point out everybody else in the other photos.
[00:14:55.356 --> 00:15:08.786]  The Navy SEALs, the Saudis that were getting ready to go with the good old boy angle, the liberal media run by the White House, MSNBC, Media Matters, all of them, had already come out and said, it will be a white person, it's a lone wolf.
[00:15:08.786 --> 00:15:12.349]  Janet Napolitano had said that, Axelrod, the fix was in.
[00:15:12.349 --> 00:15:15.132]  And ladies and gentlemen, we blew their up.
[00:15:15.132 --> 00:15:17.654]  And I'm sitting there with the bumper music already playing.
[00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.691]  To come in here, Paul Watson's waiting, and I'm looking at that TV.
[00:15:22.691 --> 00:15:25.952]  Guys, you can use the internal camera in there if you want to aim at the TV and show people.
[00:15:25.952 --> 00:15:30.973]  I'm looking at that TV with it turned up, standing there as the bumper music's playing, and I know what's about to come.
[00:15:30.973 --> 00:15:34.774]  I know what Blitzer's being told.
[00:15:34.774 --> 00:15:35.894]  This is incredible.
[00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.295]  This is beyond a movie.
[00:15:37.295 --> 00:15:42.336]  And sure enough, he says right out of his mouth, well, they've got some photos of some of the suspects right there near the finish line.
[00:15:42.336 --> 00:15:43.296]  They're going to be releasing.
[00:15:43.296 --> 00:15:44.156]  They need our help with.
[00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:47.017]  And then by the next break, they talked about the arrest.
[00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:52.460]  They're like, let's hurry up then and just roll out our John Doe number one, the redneck.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.740]  But see, then they went, no, you can't do that.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.741]  Everyone's already got the photos.
[00:15:58.741 --> 00:16:00.361]  Yeah, that's the computer screen.
[00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:03.482]  It's up above it, the TV that we have news on.
[00:16:03.482 --> 00:16:08.923]  I want to show people that so they understand what's going on.
[00:16:08.923 --> 00:16:12.944]  So I'm watching this in live time and then I go on air and I say,
[00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:26.161]  I predict they're going to cancel the press conference, and I predict they'll wait to release stuff, and then now they'll jump and come out with the Saudis when they do.
[00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:28.122]  And sure enough, they've now flipped it.
[00:16:28.122 --> 00:16:32.303]  Because in Oklahoma City, they were going to either blame Iraqis or patriots.
[00:16:32.303 --> 00:16:34.383]  They always like to have it all there.
[00:16:34.383 --> 00:16:37.844]  And state police arrested Iraqis.
[00:16:37.844 --> 00:16:42.666]  They were trying to get out of the country with wiring and stuff in their bag at the airport.
[00:16:45.157 --> 00:16:47.900]  Iraqis that have been brought in by Clinton.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.761]  That's mainstream news.
[00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:49.522]  Look it up.
[00:16:49.522 --> 00:16:53.866]  3,000 Iraqi former intelligence people who'd really already been trained by the West in the 80s.
[00:16:53.866 --> 00:16:56.289]  They were just coming home.
[00:16:56.289 --> 00:17:03.136]  Just off the chart, you're seeing like a spy movie on air right now.
[00:17:03.136 --> 00:17:04.177]  That's what's going on here.
[00:17:06.679 --> 00:17:11.842]  This is just completely and totally unprecedented in the history of media.
[00:17:11.842 --> 00:17:18.006]  Anonymous sends us this info, and then the disinfo ops come out and say, oh well maybe the government wanted this stuff out.
[00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:20.547]  This stuff had been out on Twitter and Facebook for days.
[00:17:20.547 --> 00:17:22.869]  We went yesterday and took the images.
[00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:28.710]  That Anonymous sent us, and that Watson discovered, and we're now in contact with them.
[00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.191]  We took the images, ran it through a Google image search to find where they originally came from.
[00:17:33.191 --> 00:17:35.212]  It will show you the originator, for those that don't know.
[00:17:35.212 --> 00:17:36.812]  That's been out for a couple years.
[00:17:36.812 --> 00:17:40.253]  And we found the Facebooks in places where people had just uploaded this.
[00:17:40.253 --> 00:17:47.635]  So they went out, probably intelligence people that don't like what's happening, grabbed all this, sent it to us, and said, here it is, okay Jones?
[00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:50.996]  And then we put it out, and then Drudge picked it up, and it was all over
[00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:57.939]  The beginning of the collapse of the cover-up then began last night when Drudge linked to us.
[00:17:57.939 --> 00:18:00.361]  I went and took a few hours of sleep, woke back up at midnight.
[00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:01.901]  Drudge had it up.
[00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:06.404]  And it is just explosive across the internet.
[00:18:06.404 --> 00:18:11.286]  And now you watch the body language of these people on TV and at the memorial service.
[00:18:11.286 --> 00:18:14.628]  They are completely and totally freaked out.
[00:18:14.628 --> 00:18:16.149]  And they should be, because here's the deal.
[00:18:16.949 --> 00:18:19.772]  Emergency meeting with the Saudi Foreign Minister.
[00:18:19.772 --> 00:18:21.013]  They announced they're going to deport.
[00:18:21.013 --> 00:18:24.055]  Now they're all freaking out this Saudi who was there.
[00:18:24.055 --> 00:18:25.336]  But saying he's not a suspect.
[00:18:25.336 --> 00:18:27.838]  Now they're having to show what looks like the Saudis.
[00:18:27.838 --> 00:18:30.901]  You watch, it's going to be Saudis.
[00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.862]  Now they're freaking out about that.
[00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.844]  And saying, well, they're not suspects, but we want to know.
[00:18:34.844 --> 00:18:35.885]  Because they have to.
[00:18:35.885 --> 00:18:37.987]  Because everybody on the internet's already seen this.
[00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:42.140]  Okay, so you've got all that.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:48.303]  And by the way, the shape in the back of that guy's bag is the exact design of the type of pressure cooker and the company it put out.
[00:18:48.303 --> 00:18:52.045]  There's also online comparisons to the pressure cooker.
[00:18:52.045 --> 00:18:56.688]  There's actually shots that show you can see where the lid of the pressure cooker is sticking out at the back of the bag.
[00:18:56.688 --> 00:18:58.989]  It's the exact shape of those pressure cookers.
[00:19:00.615 --> 00:19:02.196]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:19:02.196 --> 00:19:04.638]  And they were going to blame gun owners yesterday.
[00:19:04.638 --> 00:19:06.539]  They were going to have their press conference.
[00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:08.120]  They were going to roll out the Patsy.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:08.981]  Let's see the Patsy.
[00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.362]  It was actually two of them.
[00:19:10.362 --> 00:19:23.411]  Let's see the Beavis and Butthead central casting achy, breaky heart lookalike mullet guy, who's also got a backpack that matches the one that actually exploded with the strap.
[00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:32.345]  And let me explain how, and you've got guys hiding in doorways with black bags at the finish line that look like special ops.
[00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:34.125]  You've got the good old boys.
[00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:35.145]  There's your patsy.
[00:19:35.145 --> 00:19:37.506]  Undoubtedly, that's the guy.
[00:19:37.506 --> 00:19:39.966]  In my analysis, they had at the courthouse that they'd already arrested.
[00:19:39.966 --> 00:19:41.106]  They were going to roll out.
[00:19:41.106 --> 00:19:43.387]  Probably drugged up out of his mind.
[00:19:43.387 --> 00:19:47.208]  Probably the guy you see running away by the body features with his clothes half blown off.
[00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:48.748]  Poor guy got set up.
[00:19:48.748 --> 00:19:50.628]  And they were going to roll him out yesterday, but didn't.
[00:19:50.628 --> 00:19:53.309]  Then they had to evacuate the courthouse to get the press out.
[00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:57.978]  To take this guy out the back door, and he's probably in a cement shoes right now.
[00:19:57.978 --> 00:20:00.083]  So, uh, this is unbelievable.
[00:20:00.083 --> 00:20:04.292]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have blown a major New World operation sky high.
[00:20:06.312 --> 00:20:07.713]  Oh my, it's unbelievable.

[00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:09.039]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:11.201]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:17.446]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:22:17.446 --> 00:22:20.909]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:24.792]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:22:24.792 --> 00:22:26.173]  The fact is, you are.
[00:22:26.173 --> 00:22:27.214]  We all are.
[00:22:27.214 --> 00:22:29.536]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:12.903]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:12.903 --> 00:24:17.514]  You know, I don't want an apology from all the Neocon talk show hosts that have attacked us.
[00:24:19.065 --> 00:24:20.746]  I just want to save our country.
[00:24:20.746 --> 00:24:23.668]  And so that's why it's important I point out we've been right.
[00:24:23.668 --> 00:24:28.611]  I confirmed we were attacked yesterday by You Know Who, the other big host that lives in Texas.
[00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:32.433]  Even though today he's basically reporting what we said.
[00:24:32.433 --> 00:24:36.495]  Michael Savage reported on this and rightfully exposed.
[00:24:36.495 --> 00:24:39.737]  It looks like a false flag with his guest and callers yesterday.
[00:24:39.737 --> 00:24:42.499]  So good job to Michael Savage.
[00:24:42.499 --> 00:24:46.441]  And again, it's not that I mind being attacked personally.
[00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:47.002]  That's just because
[00:24:47.842 --> 00:24:54.144]  Like Michael Savage said when he was on, he's going to come back on soon, that the lead sleigh dog, you know, has the other ones barking at his butt.
[00:24:54.144 --> 00:24:57.005]  He said it a little bit different than that, but that's what's happening.
[00:24:57.005 --> 00:25:00.787]  But I don't care about being lead sleigh dog, and I don't like it, quite frankly.
[00:25:00.787 --> 00:25:14.652]  I'd rather have everybody get what's happening, we talk about it, we expose the fact that government is provocateuring and staging events to take our liberties, and that that's a historical fact, and so even when they're real events, don't let them take your rights, because they're only going to use it to enslave you.
[00:25:15.851 --> 00:25:18.095]  Because I just want my children to have a future.
[00:25:18.095 --> 00:25:22.463]  And I have tried to put out the olive branch towards the neocon conservatives.
[00:25:22.463 --> 00:25:25.308]  And most of them have accepted it.
[00:25:25.308 --> 00:25:27.552]  But you know what?
[00:25:27.552 --> 00:25:28.814]  I am just blown away right now.
[00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:33.522]  Uh, at what I ended up hearing yesterday and what Tim FergÃ© told me he heard.
[00:25:33.522 --> 00:25:39.128]  Uh, and then today they then say, oh, it is, it's a cover up for the Saudis.
[00:25:39.128 --> 00:25:43.553]  Yeah, with Navy SEALs everywhere and good old boys they were going to set up.
[00:25:43.553 --> 00:25:50.380]  I mean, we've now found about 20 people with big black backpacks with earpieces and lanyards around their necks directing the police.
[00:25:51.437 --> 00:25:53.678]  You got guys everywhere with black backpacks.
[00:25:53.678 --> 00:25:56.818]  There's the Saudis right there with good ol' boys with bombs.
[00:25:56.818 --> 00:25:58.439]  Those are the Patsy's, clearly.
[00:25:58.439 --> 00:25:59.759]  It's a setup.
[00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:01.660]  A bunch of people got killed and maimed.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:07.161]  And we've got high def video and photos of it all at the finish line.
[00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:11.522]  Crawling with Navy SEALs, wearing Navy SEAL hats.
[00:26:11.522 --> 00:26:13.963]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:26:13.963 --> 00:26:16.283]  And again, they're going to spin it and say I'm saying the Navy SEALs did it.
[00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:18.564]  No, they're standing there on walkie-talkies and phones.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.301]  We've got videos of them, you name it.
[00:26:21.301 --> 00:26:30.924]  The bomb goes off, they're there with the police trying to save people, but they're all there, part of the drill that they were announcing was going on, that's now been confirmed.
[00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:33.345]  And then, they come out and go, we've caught the guy!
[00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:34.286]  And then, no we haven't!
[00:26:34.286 --> 00:26:38.687]  And then the media's not, well, why did you say you caught him then?
[00:26:38.687 --> 00:26:41.768]  Or, why did you shut down the courthouse where you said you had him?
[00:26:41.768 --> 00:26:48.571]  The media's all waiting to see the guy, and everybody get out, there's a bomb threat at the very courthouse, because they didn't want the media seeing where that guy went.
[00:26:51.919 --> 00:27:01.749]  The guy looks like a cross between an East Texas hillbilly and an Appalachian West Virginian hillbilly.
[00:27:01.749 --> 00:27:06.374]  And then he's got somebody else with him that's clearly his handler.
[00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:11.119]  And remember folks, I said before all this happened yesterday.
[00:27:13.268 --> 00:27:23.226]  I said, you watch, they're gonna come out and say the Saudis are the people with these photos, and then a day later, the photos we break, that we show you, and the drudge amplifies.
[00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:35.549]  Homeland Security comes out and says, here's the person of interest, and it's the very stills and photos we showed you yesterday, and no media gives us credit, instead of making fun of us and attacking us.
[00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:38.110]  All the George Soros outfits are attacking us.
[00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.432]  Media Matters, run by the White House, is attacking us.
[00:27:41.432 --> 00:27:43.373]  And Glenn Beck is.
[00:27:43.373 --> 00:27:45.154]  Mercilessly.
[00:27:45.154 --> 00:27:50.796]  While doing limited hangout damage control, saying it must be the Saudis.
[00:27:50.796 --> 00:27:54.257]  So that's the credit you get for breaking the biggest story in
[00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:58.456]  Anytime I could ever imagine.
[00:27:58.456 --> 00:28:02.098]  And again, I don't even want to do this dangerous breaking of the story.
[00:28:02.098 --> 00:28:04.119]  But God is on our side.
[00:28:04.119 --> 00:28:08.461]  Dan Bodondi, our East Coast reporter, makes it to the press conferences, brings up false flag.
[00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:11.563]  It's been in the top three search terms the last two days running.
[00:28:11.563 --> 00:28:16.186]  In fact, guys, if you go to InfoWars.com, Adon Salazar's article's up and shows the Google Analytics.
[00:28:16.186 --> 00:28:18.507]  False flag, one of the top terms in the country.
[00:28:18.507 --> 00:28:22.909]  Harry Reid saying, you conspiracy theorists worried about false flags in his speech yesterday.
[00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:23.570]  We're going to play that.
[00:28:24.639 --> 00:28:27.842]  They are absolutely panicking right now.
[00:28:27.842 --> 00:28:38.973]  Yeah, that's great guys, but he has, in his article, he has the Google Analytics that shows the last three days as it grew up to this giant spike.
[00:28:38.973 --> 00:28:43.237]  Adon Salazar, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:43.237 --> 00:28:47.041]  So again, this is part of an awakening of America that's happening.
[00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:55.232]  When we come back, I'm going to play the high-def, high-quality audio now that we have the original tape, not just what was caught live on the news, of our reporter bringing it up.
[00:28:55.232 --> 00:29:00.553]  And you watch the body language of the relaxed, calm governor, the police chief, the feds, the ATF.
[00:29:00.553 --> 00:29:03.314]  As soon as he says, what about false flags and the drill?
[00:29:03.314 --> 00:29:08.595]  Everyone has an adrenaline rush, turns, and see, that's a criminal response.
[00:29:08.595 --> 00:29:16.397]  That's what police do when they walk up and all calmly say, hey, you know, kids, anything about beer taken out of golf carts?
[00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.370]  And then they see the kids jolt.
[00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:20.171]  It's that realization.
[00:29:20.171 --> 00:29:21.812]  This is basic police work, folks.
[00:29:21.812 --> 00:29:22.933]  They all jolt.
[00:29:22.933 --> 00:29:24.214]  Whoa, uh, the drill?
[00:29:24.214 --> 00:29:24.954]  False flag?
[00:29:24.954 --> 00:29:26.195]  Uh, no!
[00:29:26.195 --> 00:29:27.036]  The governor, no!
[00:29:27.036 --> 00:29:28.477]  His eyes all light up, no!
[00:29:28.477 --> 00:29:28.957]  Next question!
[00:29:28.957 --> 00:29:31.459]  And they all start shaking.
[00:29:31.459 --> 00:29:33.140]  We're on national TV.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.301]  I guarantee the governor wasn't there with the plunger.
[00:29:35.301 --> 00:29:36.182]  He didn't know what happened.
[00:29:36.182 --> 00:29:37.383]  He just knows there's a drill.
[00:29:37.383 --> 00:29:39.604]  Don't worry, Homeland Security's explaining it to him right now.
[00:29:41.598 --> 00:29:44.561]  They won't release the people out of the hospital unless they've already been briefed and stuff.
[00:29:44.561 --> 00:29:46.923]  They pulled an army runner out of the race.
[00:29:46.923 --> 00:29:54.830]  We're gonna come back and break down what this means, what it signifies, that their whole operation's been blown right now, and what are they probably gonna do next.
[00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.872]  This could bring them down.
[00:29:56.872 --> 00:29:58.274]  We're on the march.
[00:29:58.274 --> 00:30:00.796]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:00.796 --> 00:30:03.479]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.987 --> 00:30:11.390]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:17.454]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:30:17.454 --> 00:30:21.337]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[00:32:10.063 --> 00:32:11.504]  Other police action.
[00:32:11.504 --> 00:32:12.785]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:12.785 --> 00:32:16.507]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:16.507 --> 00:32:18.949]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:18.949 --> 00:32:24.813]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:24.813 --> 00:32:31.057]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:31.477 --> 00:32:37.422]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:41.645]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:41.645 --> 00:32:45.929]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:45.929 --> 00:32:51.874]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:51.874 --> 00:32:55.437]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:55.437 --> 00:32:57.418]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:57.418 --> 00:32:57.839]  It's here.
[00:32:58.499 --> 00:33:15.813]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:15.813 --> 00:33:23.539]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:27.751 --> 00:33:33.994]  Oh, there's no doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that this republic and our liberties and our freedoms are in the danger zone.
[00:33:33.994 --> 00:33:48.040]  But it's always been my intention, knowing about the globalist program, to build an operation, a resistance, and a core of people that are aware of the globalist program and are aware of its tricks to challenge them.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:53.823]  And then, in the time of greatest threat, we'll have a core group, cadres, in every town and city that know what to look for.
[00:33:55.197 --> 00:33:56.778]  So that we can expose their operations.
[00:33:56.778 --> 00:34:02.902]  And now every false flag they have, our operatives, which are just liberty-loving people, are there.
[00:34:02.902 --> 00:34:05.363]  We catch the government getting the underwear bomber on the plane.
[00:34:05.363 --> 00:34:06.664]  Blow that operation for them.
[00:34:06.664 --> 00:34:08.305]  Even came out in Congress.
[00:34:08.305 --> 00:34:12.267]  Month and a half after we broke it and told you here with the eyewitnesses.
[00:34:12.267 --> 00:34:13.828]  It's the same thing with this operation.
[00:34:13.828 --> 00:34:15.509]  It's the same thing with so many others.
[00:34:15.509 --> 00:34:22.473]  The truth is, in this universe, good actually has the advantage if you'll take the field.
[00:34:24.178 --> 00:34:26.299]  Providence smiles on you.
[00:34:26.299 --> 00:34:31.042]  But if you don't fight it, if you don't take the steps, then you'll never defeat evil.
[00:34:31.042 --> 00:34:33.383]  And people have just decided, oh, you're evil.
[00:34:33.383 --> 00:34:34.844]  Oh, you're wearing a uniform.
[00:34:34.844 --> 00:34:35.724]  Oh, you're the government.
[00:34:35.724 --> 00:34:37.105]  Oh, you're Wolf Blitzer.
[00:34:37.105 --> 00:34:40.707]  Oh, you're Chris Matthews.
[00:34:40.707 --> 00:34:45.229]  I have a clip coming up of MSNBC saying the Second Amendment did the bombing.
[00:34:45.229 --> 00:34:47.331]  And you're like, that doesn't make sense.
[00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:50.892]  Well, saying if you don't support Obamacare, you're racist doesn't either.
[00:34:50.892 --> 00:34:53.574]  They're trying to dumb the whole debate down.
[00:34:56.874 --> 00:35:03.640]  To saying, hey, there is no Family Guy episode where they bomb the Boston Marathon, which there is.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.382]  By the way, I looked this up this morning and it completely blew me away.
[00:35:06.382 --> 00:35:08.304]  Don Salazar's posting it.
[00:35:08.304 --> 00:35:15.470]  Did you know that the marathon ended, the tape ended at, what is it, 666 Boyd Street?
[00:35:20.526 --> 00:35:21.546]  Boylston Street.
[00:35:21.546 --> 00:35:22.667]  666 Boylston Street.
[00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:24.948]  I mean, just the weirdness of all of this.
[00:35:24.948 --> 00:35:27.429]  And it's so many times stuff like this happens.
[00:35:27.429 --> 00:35:34.231]  You know, that's the psychopaths leaving their little calling card for you right there.
[00:35:34.231 --> 00:35:42.995]  And again, not everything is a conspiracy, but big, massive events like this, you better believe, you better believe they're orchestrated.
[00:35:45.007 --> 00:35:46.389]  Let's go to the false flag article.
[00:35:46.389 --> 00:35:52.554]  Can you guys put the false flag article up that Don Salazar just posted at InfoWars.com?
[00:35:52.554 --> 00:35:53.695]  Let's show TV viewers.
[00:35:53.695 --> 00:35:56.357]  If you're a radio listener, just go to InfoWars.com.
[00:35:56.357 --> 00:36:04.144]  There is, over the last nine years of Google Analytics, the top search terms for false flag.
[00:36:04.144 --> 00:36:06.186]  Going back to, what, 2003 or so.
[00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:17.557]  So you can see there on the graph it is 100 times the number of people roughly are searching it that have ever searched it before.
[00:36:17.557 --> 00:36:23.201]  100 times the people are searching false flag.
[00:36:24.755 --> 00:36:25.896]  than they did before.
[00:36:25.896 --> 00:36:37.564]  And Harry Reid, when he got mad about not being able to ban our guns in the Senate, vowed to reintroduce more bills, and don't worry, they'll get some more drugged up patsies wound up right now to teach you that it's your fault.
[00:36:37.564 --> 00:36:46.530]  But he said, how dare the black helicopter crowd talk about false flags, and other globalists are talking about false flags now.
[00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.313]  They are panicking because the idea that, hey, who else could be involved?
[00:36:51.613 --> 00:36:54.174]  Not just who you tell me could be involved.
[00:36:54.174 --> 00:36:56.195]  You've got a history of being involved.
[00:36:56.195 --> 00:36:57.896]  And don't stonewall us on this.
[00:36:57.896 --> 00:37:00.037]  You stand to gain from this.
[00:37:00.037 --> 00:37:05.920]  And oh, why are there these videos and photos of rednecks with black backpacks looking suspicious?
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.421]  Of Saudis with black backpacks looking suspicious?
[00:37:08.421 --> 00:37:09.682]  Middle Eastern men, clearly.
[00:37:09.682 --> 00:37:10.642]  They look like Saudis to me.
[00:37:12.283 --> 00:37:14.945]  Uh, the Fino type or whatever you call it.
[00:37:14.945 --> 00:37:17.066]  And you've got what are Navy SEALs.
[00:37:17.066 --> 00:37:21.789]  It's not just the grape, not just the tan pants, the tan combat boots, the black shirts.
[00:37:21.789 --> 00:37:22.770]  I mean, it's the bearing.
[00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:23.870]  I've seen Navy SEALs.
[00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.471]  They look just like Chris Kyle.
[00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:27.392]  It's an exact type they go for.
[00:37:27.392 --> 00:37:30.434]  You'll watch Zero Dark Thirty, but that's what the SEALs look like.
[00:37:30.434 --> 00:37:34.617]  I mean, they go for a certain type and they're all there crawling all over it.
[00:37:35.177 --> 00:37:40.940]  They are crawling all over it, hiding in doorways with black backpacks, directing the police.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:47.843]  We have video of what looks like about a 50-year-old SEAL, in the same outfit, directing police, right after the bombing.
[00:37:47.843 --> 00:37:51.925]  We've got what looks like, that guy looks like an old grizzled 50-year-old Green Beret.
[00:37:51.925 --> 00:37:54.727]  I've just learned the looks of these guys from their eras.
[00:37:54.727 --> 00:37:59.629]  That guy looks like Delta Force or something, crouching there with a big black backpack, right before the bombs go off.
[00:38:01.144 --> 00:38:12.275]  I mean, you've got guys everywhere with black backpacks, spec ops, with just all this stuff going on, and they did not want this out.
[00:38:12.275 --> 00:38:18.761]  That's why they pushed up their timeline and announced the arrest, but then figured out that wasn't going to work, because they're not just going to roll out the good old boy.
[00:38:19.966 --> 00:38:33.454]  And now I looked at Janet Napolitano, she looked like a deer in the headlights, like she was completely freaked out, and on methamphetamine today, during the congressional hearing, where she said, we do have two photos of men of interest, the photos we showed you yesterday.
[00:38:33.454 --> 00:38:34.755]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:38:34.755 --> 00:38:40.558]  You know the New York Times or CNN or Fox News said, hey, look at these photos we found.
[00:38:40.558 --> 00:38:41.458]  Don't these look suspicious?
[00:38:41.458 --> 00:38:44.980]  You know, they'll show you a guy on the roof all day and say, ooh, who is it?
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.581]  Who could it be?
[00:38:46.874 --> 00:38:49.096]  Because there it's all blurred and you can't tell.
[00:38:49.096 --> 00:38:55.360]  But for a day, there are these photos and videos and none of them will show it.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.023]  Until the government says, now it's okay to show this.
[00:39:00.023 --> 00:39:03.365]  And they show you some photos that we already showed you.
[00:39:03.365 --> 00:39:04.946]  And no one gives us credit.
[00:39:04.946 --> 00:39:11.671]  Instead, there are hundreds of hit pieces saying I'm crazy and dangerous yesterday and today.
[00:39:11.671 --> 00:39:13.412]  You know why I'm crazy and dangerous?
[00:39:13.412 --> 00:39:16.114]  Because I've got my head screwed on, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not stupid.
[00:39:17.685 --> 00:39:19.325]  And you're not stupid either.
[00:39:19.325 --> 00:39:22.126]  I know it's scary to admit this to yourself.
[00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:25.447]  I understand it's easier just to be in denial, but come on.
[00:39:25.447 --> 00:39:29.048]  I'm the one that's publicly up here, tip of the spear, doing all this.
[00:39:29.048 --> 00:39:36.530]  The least you can do is speak up for us, promote our links, our videos, what we're doing, so that if I get destroyed, it isn't in vain.
[00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.130]  Because I'm not afraid of being killed.
[00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.871]  I'm not afraid of being tortured.
[00:39:39.871 --> 00:39:46.694]  I'm not afraid of being politically destroyed and called names and ridiculed because I care about the future and my children.
[00:39:46.694 --> 00:39:52.417]  That is a male instinct to not care when you know you're right and to feel sorry for the people that attack you.
[00:39:52.417 --> 00:39:54.278]  And it does hurt me.
[00:39:54.278 --> 00:40:02.802]  It does hurt me when, even though we broke all this, mainline big talk show hosts who claim they're libertarian are attacking me because it hurts me for my children.
[00:40:03.698 --> 00:40:10.781]  I need those people to not be bad operatives, probably now, and to stand up for America and put this news out.
[00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:20.404]  Because if this news was put out by Glenn Beck, instead of limited, oh, it's Saudis, Obama's covering up for Saudis, which is going on, that's part of it.
[00:40:20.404 --> 00:40:22.745]  If he went, why are there Navy SEALs?
[00:40:22.745 --> 00:40:24.646]  Why are there people in doorways?
[00:40:24.646 --> 00:40:26.306]  Why do they have black backpacks?
[00:40:26.306 --> 00:40:30.348]  Who are these good old boys whose backpack matches the bomb that went off?
[00:40:30.988 --> 00:40:38.491]  They have the shot of the shattered black backpack with the same black, same silver stripe, all of it, of the guys that were right there where the bombs went off.
[00:40:38.491 --> 00:40:46.835]  And it looks like the Patsy, when you see the explosion, he runs with his clothes half blown off, like a cartoon character, you know when Yosemite Sam has the bomb go off?
[00:40:47.642 --> 00:40:50.303]  That's what it really looks like when a bomb goes off close to you.
[00:40:50.303 --> 00:40:51.443]  You see him running?
[00:40:51.443 --> 00:40:53.083]  Probably set up.
[00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.623]  That's probably their suspect.
[00:40:54.623 --> 00:40:55.964]  They had him at the courthouse.
[00:40:55.964 --> 00:40:58.344]  They were going to roll him out, and they cancelled it.
[00:40:58.344 --> 00:41:00.445]  And again, this is not my speculation.
[00:41:00.445 --> 00:41:05.346]  I told you yesterday that these are the photos of the Saudis.
[00:41:05.346 --> 00:41:10.587]  And then now, today, it's in congressional hearings, the photos of the Saudis.
[00:41:10.587 --> 00:41:11.907]  Now, are you going to listen to me?
[00:41:11.907 --> 00:41:13.507]  Because I am immersed in this.
[00:41:13.507 --> 00:41:15.188]  This is all I do.
[00:41:15.188 --> 00:41:16.248]  I went to bed yesterday.
[00:41:17.193 --> 00:41:18.653]  I've been about seven.
[00:41:18.653 --> 00:41:21.675]  Went and saw my children, went to bed, woke up at midnight, went back to work.
[00:41:21.675 --> 00:41:27.076]  And while I dreamed, I was working out these problems in my head.
[00:41:27.076 --> 00:41:31.598]  I was at work while I was sleeping, totally concentrating, and I'm not even trained to do this.
[00:41:31.598 --> 00:41:33.058]  They can train people to do this.
[00:41:33.058 --> 00:41:37.320]  My dad took a course on it in college, was actually able to control his dreams and do homework on his dreams and stuff.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.721]  But the point is, I was working while I was asleep on this, okay?
[00:41:42.635 --> 00:41:48.079]  I've been on video editing projects before that are real long and hard, you know, and you start doing the video editing in your mind when you're asleep.
[00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:50.121]  The point is, is that I eat, drink and sleep this.
[00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:51.482]  That's where that term comes from.
[00:41:51.482 --> 00:41:53.263]  I eat, drink and sleep this.
[00:41:53.263 --> 00:41:55.184]  And now I need to be able to settle down.
[00:41:55.184 --> 00:41:58.427]  I need to be able to have a break today.
[00:41:58.427 --> 00:41:59.928]  I'll probably be able to do that by the nightly news.
[00:41:59.928 --> 00:42:01.409]  I need to go sit in a room for about an hour.
[00:42:01.409 --> 00:42:07.693]  That's why a psychologist will have you lay on a couch because you can get reflective and think.
[00:42:07.693 --> 00:42:11.376]  I need to go lay on a couch in my office for about an hour.
[00:42:13.463 --> 00:42:21.137]  And I need to think about what they're going to do next and what they're thinking about and what they're planning.
[00:42:23.476 --> 00:42:27.017]  That's what I have to do because right now I'm so focused on this.
[00:42:27.017 --> 00:42:43.721]  Also, two days ago, a Congressional bipartisan commission said there was a systematic order of torture, including children, by Bush and by Obama and a deliberate attempt to cover it up and continue to order the military to engage in hardcore class-A felonies.
[00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.132]  Punishable by death, by the way.
[00:42:47.132 --> 00:42:50.795]  That is the punishment for torturing people to death, including children.
[00:42:50.795 --> 00:42:54.619]  The Army report, again, came out in 2006, the Toogoomba Report.
[00:42:54.619 --> 00:43:01.786]  Our own government's report admitted the torture of children until death, unto death in front of their parents.
[00:43:01.786 --> 00:43:04.128]  See, the government right now is having a come-to-Jesus moment.
[00:43:04.468 --> 00:43:05.848]  Because they all play at being tough.
[00:43:05.848 --> 00:43:07.009]  They all play at being evil.
[00:43:07.009 --> 00:43:09.529]  You know, they all play at, you know, doing hardcore stuff.
[00:43:09.529 --> 00:43:18.051]  But, you know, becoming evil to guard good and that old Machiavellian lie of guard the truth with lies and be more evil than the devil to protect good.
[00:43:18.051 --> 00:43:18.851]  You don't protect good.
[00:43:18.851 --> 00:43:21.792]  You become the devil.
[00:43:21.792 --> 00:43:23.952]  And you lose providence when you do that.
[00:43:23.952 --> 00:43:25.712]  You lose God's hedge of protection.
[00:43:25.712 --> 00:43:27.933]  It's a curse on our land to have these leaders.
[00:43:27.933 --> 00:43:29.833]  And people are looking at their grandkids right now.
[00:43:29.833 --> 00:43:31.914]  And they're looking at where all this is going.
[00:43:31.914 --> 00:43:33.314]  And they're figuring out they're going to be
[00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:35.952]  destroyed in this as well.
[00:43:35.952 --> 00:43:38.696]  No one's getting out of this.
[00:43:38.696 --> 00:43:41.220]  No one gets away with this stuff.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.044]  Mao was basically taken out at the end.
[00:43:44.044 --> 00:43:46.127]  His wife was locked up in prison.
[00:43:46.127 --> 00:43:49.272]  Even the communist Chinese didn't like him killing between 65 and 84 million people.
[00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:54.043]  None of you are going to get away with this.
[00:43:54.043 --> 00:43:59.667]  I mean, it's a law of human instinct that your own people are going to start turning against you.
[00:43:59.667 --> 00:44:05.552]  And again, these are Star Wars analogies, like Darth Vader throwing Emperor Palpatine down the reactor shaft.
[00:44:05.552 --> 00:44:08.574]  You are not going to get away with this.
[00:44:08.574 --> 00:44:11.016]  You need to understand that.
[00:44:11.016 --> 00:44:12.757]  And later, at the start of the next hour,
[00:44:17.205 --> 00:44:18.786]  I want to talk to the globalists.
[00:44:18.786 --> 00:44:21.767]  I thought about this this morning in a moment of clarity.
[00:44:21.767 --> 00:44:24.568]  I have a message.
[00:44:24.568 --> 00:44:30.511]  I have a message to the globalists that we're going to be going over and getting to coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:44:30.511 --> 00:44:32.752]  The Max Keiser is going to pop in with us on some other issues.
[00:44:32.752 --> 00:44:35.433]  But really, there is no other issue but this.
[00:44:35.433 --> 00:44:37.774]  And again, they don't want these photos out.
[00:44:38.615 --> 00:44:40.396]  People keep believing that we can't win.
[00:44:40.396 --> 00:44:44.478]  People keep believing that the enemy is superhuman and impossible to beat.
[00:44:44.478 --> 00:44:47.179]  Good people are smarter than evil people.
[00:44:47.179 --> 00:44:54.303]  When we stop being naive and foolish and turn our minds towards understanding the enemy.
[00:44:54.303 --> 00:45:01.327]  And all you've got to do is put yourself in their shoes and what they've done in a Pavlovian, pathological way in the past.
[00:45:01.327 --> 00:45:05.249]  Because criminals are obsessive if they're anything.
[00:45:06.485 --> 00:45:16.736]  Psychopaths, sociopaths, masochists, sadists, these people are all pathological.
[00:45:16.736 --> 00:45:24.664]  You wonder why the culture is so dark, so evil, even though it doesn't even get ratings now, they still keep pushing the most evil stuff that you can imagine.
[00:45:25.922 --> 00:45:28.225]  You wonder why all that is going on?
[00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:31.288]  That's because they're showing you what they like.
[00:45:31.288 --> 00:45:33.371]  They're trying to make our world like their world.
[00:45:33.371 --> 00:45:40.379]  But you have a show like The Bible with 15, 20 million viewers on cable when nothing gets, you know, even 2 million viewers.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.140]  People are hungry for wholesomeness.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.381]  They're hungry for good.
[00:45:44.381 --> 00:45:45.621]  And we're force-fed.
[00:45:45.621 --> 00:45:47.341]  It's like the golden child.
[00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:55.543]  Another great analogy where the demon's trying to feed the golden child, you know, the sacrificed kid's blood in the oatmeal because he believes that he can corrupt him.
[00:45:55.543 --> 00:45:58.104]  That's an archetype, an allegory.
[00:45:58.104 --> 00:45:59.344]  Then they'll be able to kill him.
[00:45:59.344 --> 00:46:01.745]  They can't kill him because he's so pure.
[00:46:01.745 --> 00:46:02.785]  It's the same thing.
[00:46:02.785 --> 00:46:08.106]  They need to corrupt you because once they've got you corrupted, they can bring you down.
[00:46:08.106 --> 00:46:10.647]  Then they have access to trespass against you.
[00:46:12.867 --> 00:46:18.469]  All you gotta do is pray to God to give you providence and to give you protection.
[00:46:18.469 --> 00:46:22.250]  And even if you don't believe in this, all the medical studies show prayer really works for whatever reason.
[00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:27.932]  Maybe it's, maybe, maybe if you're secular, it's giving your brain a command.
[00:46:27.932 --> 00:46:29.872]  Your guardian angels around you.
[00:46:29.872 --> 00:46:35.694]  Maybe you don't believe in that, even though every culture has, you know, near death or death experiences and sees the same thing.
[00:46:35.694 --> 00:46:41.796]  A biblical type event, even with villages that have never seen TV, don't know the Christian narrative, they have that same event.
[00:46:43.092 --> 00:46:50.917]  Even if you don't believe in that, the brainwaves you put off around others, once you believe you have guardian angels, the guardian angels are basically there.
[00:46:50.917 --> 00:46:52.819]  And I don't mean to get off into mumbo-jumbo.
[00:46:52.819 --> 00:46:55.040]  That's not what it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.321]  But it's real.
[00:46:56.321 --> 00:46:58.402]  I have guardian angels.
[00:46:58.402 --> 00:47:03.046]  And the New World Order cannot kill me unless God decides it's time for me to die.
[00:47:03.046 --> 00:47:04.126]  You understand that?
[00:47:04.126 --> 00:47:07.348]  I cannot be killed until God decides.
[00:47:07.348 --> 00:47:09.470]  And my whole life, incredible things have happened.
[00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:12.432]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:47:12.432 --> 00:47:14.814]  And you know you've had those things happen in your life as well.
[00:47:14.814 --> 00:47:16.555]  You're supposed to just ignore that.
[00:47:16.555 --> 00:47:18.497]  So that's why I don't have any fear.
[00:47:18.497 --> 00:47:23.380]  My only fear is that I won't do a good enough job in this fight.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:31.067]  And that I won't perform to the level that God has destined me to.
[00:47:31.067 --> 00:47:32.107]  That my flesh is weak.
[00:47:32.107 --> 00:47:33.128]  My spirit is willing.
[00:47:33.128 --> 00:47:33.829]  My flesh is weak.
[00:47:35.445 --> 00:47:37.046]  My spirit is willing, my flesh is weak.
[00:47:37.046 --> 00:47:39.187]  My spirit is willing, my flesh is weak.
[00:47:39.187 --> 00:47:46.491]  And I ask God to strengthen my spirit so that I can overcome my flesh.
[00:47:46.491 --> 00:47:50.133]  And we are entering the ultimate time in our history.
[00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:56.296]  Let me go to this Dan Bodondi press conference from the night of the event.
[00:47:56.296 --> 00:48:01.039]  This is from the night of the event of the Boston Marathon.
[00:48:02.626 --> 00:48:15.174]  And this is Dan Badani, you see it from his perspective at the camera, with the governor and the police commissioner and the mayor and the ATF head, all looking at him like they want to kill him, instantly.
[00:48:15.174 --> 00:48:26.041]  See, in criminology, if somebody doesn't recognize what you're saying, I've had cops question me before, FBI, Secret Service, and they're watching to see when they show me something, if I automatically recognize it.
[00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:28.423]  And they're sitting there watching to see if I have to remember it.
[00:48:30.026 --> 00:48:31.447]  That's basic police work.
[00:48:31.447 --> 00:48:36.973]  And the minute Madandi asked him, they jolt when he says the drill and the false flag.
[00:48:36.973 --> 00:48:40.757]  And their eyes all come alive and they swing around and start, you know...
[00:48:43.228 --> 00:48:45.368]  I mean, guilty as sin.
[00:48:45.368 --> 00:48:47.409]  Guilty as a pig, and you know what?
[00:48:47.409 --> 00:48:49.189]  Now, it doesn't mean they did the bombing.
[00:48:49.189 --> 00:49:01.432]  It means they know about the drill, they've been told shut up, and the governor goes from being the fake smiley guy, like he is at the memorial service, to instantly doing a battle mode.
[00:49:01.432 --> 00:49:03.952]  His eyebrows go up, his teeth almost show.
[00:49:03.952 --> 00:49:05.973]  I mean, he's like, oh yeah!
[00:49:07.128 --> 00:49:12.612]  Like, if you walk up to somebody that, you know, been killing kids and putting them in their backyard, and you go, hey, I found those dead kids in your backyard.
[00:49:12.612 --> 00:49:13.152]  What?
[00:49:13.152 --> 00:49:15.074]  And the guy runs out the door, running through the wall?
[00:49:15.074 --> 00:49:20.818]  You couldn't get the warrant to go in his backyard where you think the kids are buried, but you just made him run.
[00:49:20.818 --> 00:49:22.739]  Now you got him.
[00:49:22.739 --> 00:49:25.441]  This is basic police work, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:25.441 --> 00:49:27.563]  But Donnie goes up and says this to them.
[00:49:27.563 --> 00:49:30.005]  We're going to come back and play it after the break.
[00:49:30.005 --> 00:49:34.328]  The video's up on InfoWars.com, and they totally freak out.
[00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:40.012]  They totally get scared, ladies and gentlemen, and of course there was a drill.
[00:49:40.012 --> 00:49:45.694]  We have multiple witnesses and have re-interviewed one of the witnesses, a major track coach of a major university.
[00:49:45.694 --> 00:49:50.235]  He said they were on the roof, they had bags, they were all around, they were right there saying, don't worry.
[00:49:50.235 --> 00:49:53.096]  At the start and the finish, he's a track coach.
[00:49:53.096 --> 00:50:01.918]  Then we have the video confirming, just like Kurt Haskell said, a sharp-dressed guy told the airport security, you're going to put him on the plane without a passport, I don't care.
[00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:20.817]  And was so authoritative they followed his order and it turned out it was an unnamed US intelligence agency that got the authorization of the Dutch government in Amsterdam to get drugged out Muttalib on that aircraft.
[00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:23.659]  Then they put out a green screen video of Muttalib that was totally fake.
[00:50:23.659 --> 00:50:24.439]  We proved it.
[00:50:24.439 --> 00:50:25.860]  This is how dumb they think you are.
[00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.672]  They're just men like us that we're fighting.
[00:50:28.672 --> 00:50:29.774]  They're men and women like us.
[00:50:29.774 --> 00:50:35.600]  We can beat them if we have the will, and if we have the courage, and if we set ourselves against them.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.563]  Look, I'm setting myself against you.
[00:50:37.563 --> 00:50:38.864]  I'm not going to sleep.
[00:50:38.864 --> 00:50:44.110]  I'm going to fight you as hard as I can, and I call on the creator of the universe to give me discernment.
[00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:47.434]  And if it's God's will you be defeated, then so be it.
[00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:55.237]  And maybe it's God's will that just his people see the truth, and the rest of the world's in denial and accepts the delusion.
[00:50:55.237 --> 00:50:58.481]  But, I mean, they got the Saudi ambassador in emergency meetings.
[00:50:58.481 --> 00:50:59.703]  They're canceling things.
[00:50:59.703 --> 00:51:01.265]  They're evacuating courthouses.
[00:51:01.265 --> 00:51:03.027]  They are freaking out to cover this up.
[00:51:03.027 --> 00:51:05.450]  We have caught them red-handed in a false flag.
[00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:06.472]  They're going to blame it on gun owners.
[00:51:08.203 --> 00:51:10.604]  You've heard about our MRE Smorgasbord.
[00:51:10.604 --> 00:51:18.827]  Now, Long Life Food Depot introduces the most unique, safe, and longest-lasting way to stash emergency food, the EatPod.
[00:51:18.827 --> 00:51:25.330]  Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps, low moisture, and low oxygen.
[00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:27.531]  If you're storing in a basement too humid,
[00:51:27.731 --> 00:51:28.952]  Garages and Attics?
[00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:29.753]  Too hot!
[00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:46.086]  But the waterproof, double-walled, high-density polyethylene patent-pending EatPodâ¢ is a unique roll-away food bunker that creates the perfect conditions, can be buried up to 30 feet, and can keep your survival food supply safe, secure, dry, and virtually undetectable.
[00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:53.073]  For 25 years or more, get full details on the EatPod at eatpod.com spelled E-A-T-P-O-D dot com or call 800-601-2833.
[00:51:53.073 --> 00:51:53.394]  That's 800-601-2833.
[00:51:53.394 --> 00:51:55.176]  The EatPod from Long Life Food Depot.
[00:51:55.176 --> 00:51:57.118]  Since 1983, sending real food to your real future.
[00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:11.092]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:52:11.092 --> 00:52:14.474]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:52:14.474 --> 00:52:17.455]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[00:52:17.455 --> 00:52:28.382]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[00:52:28.382 --> 00:52:29.522]  Then there's affordability.
[00:52:29.522 --> 00:52:34.445]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, even
[00:52:34.445 --> 00:52:35.125]  I think so.
[00:53:02.059 --> 00:53:03.400]  Free shipping on every order over $50.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:07.464]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[00:53:07.464 --> 00:53:11.927]  Nothing is more American than Diamond Gusset jeans.
[00:53:11.927 --> 00:53:14.670]  100% American made since 1987.
[00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:16.691]  Soft and broken in from the start.
[00:53:16.691 --> 00:53:20.595]  Yet more rugged and durable than any jean you've ever worn.
[00:53:20.595 --> 00:53:23.597]  Have you ever experienced missized jeans from China?
[00:53:23.597 --> 00:53:25.819]  Well you won't with Diamond Gusset.
[00:53:25.819 --> 00:53:30.163]  Every pair is crafted to fit exactly the same and always feel like they were custom made.
[00:53:30.863 --> 00:53:32.564]  Need a 35, 37, or 39 waist?
[00:53:32.564 --> 00:53:35.665]  How about a 31 inseam?
[00:53:35.665 --> 00:53:38.666]  We keep all sizes in stock for the fit you need.
[00:53:38.666 --> 00:53:42.927]  Looking for a relaxed fit, slim fit, regular fit, boot cut, or straight leg?
[00:53:42.927 --> 00:53:44.487]  We got you covered.
[00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:50.189]  Buy the world's best fitting jeans at Gusset.com or call 1-888-8GUSSET.
[00:53:50.189 --> 00:53:55.491]  Get free Gusset targets for the next time you go to the shooting range with the purchase of their new Ranger jean.
[00:53:56.171 --> 00:53:56.552]  I think so.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:19.164]  Everybody knows it was a false flag.
[00:54:19.164 --> 00:54:25.189]  And Janet Napolitano, she knows that you know.
[00:54:25.189 --> 00:54:29.812]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:54:29.812 --> 00:54:34.416]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:37.939]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[00:54:38.459 --> 00:54:39.420]  We are back live.
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.401]  Again, look at these headlines.
[00:54:40.401 --> 00:54:42.623]  Obama meets with Saudi Foreign Minister.
[00:54:42.623 --> 00:54:46.586]  They claim they discussed Syria, but this was not on the schedule.
[00:54:46.586 --> 00:54:48.107]  That's unprecedented.
[00:54:48.107 --> 00:54:54.553]  They evacuate the courthouse where they reportedly were going to be having a press conference where they had the suspect.
[00:54:54.553 --> 00:54:55.293]  Oh, but never mind.
[00:54:55.293 --> 00:54:56.715]  We don't have a suspect.
[00:54:56.715 --> 00:54:58.236]  We don't have the person that did it.
[00:54:58.236 --> 00:55:00.678]  We were ready to announce.
[00:55:00.678 --> 00:55:02.059]  Oh, can't.
[00:55:02.059 --> 00:55:03.881]  Can't roll out the rednecks, can you?
[00:55:05.367 --> 00:55:10.410]  You had the Saudis there, you had the Rednecks, you had the Navy SEALs there, you had everybody there with the black backpacks.
[00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:16.333]  So in case any cops happened to find the bombs, you would just say it was a drill.
[00:55:16.333 --> 00:55:18.534]  That's how you always do it.
[00:55:18.534 --> 00:55:27.779]  And again, if I was those Navy SEALs, I'm going to tell you right now, they're either with Kraft International, people are saying that because it has the red Kraft symbol on the death's head.
[00:55:29.099 --> 00:55:40.208]  Or it's Blackwater who uses the same symbol, but it's standard, kind of plain dress that the SEALs wear, and it's SEALs, and experts are picking it up saying, you know, yes, those are SEALs.
[00:55:40.208 --> 00:55:42.529]  But regardless, they're in charge of the police, by the way.
[00:55:42.529 --> 00:55:47.994]  Right after the bomb goes off, they've got Geiger counters and stuff, and they're out there directing everything.
[00:55:47.994 --> 00:55:56.000]  So you've got maybe 20 yards from the supposed bombers, you've got Navy SEALs.
[00:55:57.945 --> 00:55:59.987]  And the government isn't showing these photos?
[00:55:59.987 --> 00:56:01.528]  Why not show these photos, media?
[00:56:01.528 --> 00:56:05.011]  You'd think, hey, look at these photos Infowars.com has.
[00:56:05.011 --> 00:56:07.993]  Look at these photos of all these people.
[00:56:07.993 --> 00:56:09.495]  You showed me a guy on a roof?
[00:56:09.495 --> 00:56:16.501]  What about all these guys in doorways crouched suspiciously with big black bags right where the bomb went off?
[00:56:16.501 --> 00:56:17.782]  Oh, but it doesn't fit the narrative.
[00:56:18.977 --> 00:56:20.238]  of the redneck.
[00:56:20.238 --> 00:56:21.460]  You were going to blame us for the bombing.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:23.181]  I mean, I can see the whole buildup.
[00:56:23.181 --> 00:56:29.847]  And the controlled White House-run media, MSNBC and others, were saying, we told you it was going to be a white tea party.
[00:56:29.847 --> 00:56:31.509]  It's a lone wolf.
[00:56:31.509 --> 00:56:33.591]  Homeland Security, that's all they'll say.
[00:56:33.591 --> 00:56:34.412]  They're getting ready.
[00:56:34.412 --> 00:56:35.213]  Ha ha!
[00:56:35.213 --> 00:56:36.774]  We got you, gun owners.
[00:56:36.774 --> 00:56:37.915]  We got you.
[00:56:37.915 --> 00:56:38.856]  We got you.
[00:56:38.856 --> 00:56:39.477]  You got us?
[00:56:40.742 --> 00:56:43.002]  Because I know you're watching right now all angry.
[00:56:43.002 --> 00:56:45.763]  Most of you are foreign intelligence operatives and globalists.
[00:56:45.763 --> 00:56:51.004]  You're all stomping around right now at Media Matters and MSNBC, taping what I'm saying, hopping mad.
[00:56:51.004 --> 00:56:54.545]  Probably, probably, probably, you know, I imagine some papers have been thrown.
[00:56:54.545 --> 00:56:56.825]  And who got blown?
[00:56:56.825 --> 00:56:58.065]  Who got defeated?
[00:56:58.065 --> 00:57:00.126]  Who got exposed?
[00:57:00.126 --> 00:57:01.286]  Who?
[00:57:01.286 --> 00:57:03.126]  Tell me again.
[00:57:03.126 --> 00:57:04.647]  And I'm not taunting these people.
[00:57:04.647 --> 00:57:06.287]  I want them to understand they're going to be defeated.
[00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.492]  I want you to understand you're in the wrong.
[00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:13.517]  I want you to understand what you did to frame us is despicable.
[00:57:13.517 --> 00:57:18.442]  And I want you to know, go ahead and try to roll it out now that it's a domestic group.
[00:57:18.442 --> 00:57:25.129]  Because they're doing the fallback now that it's foreigners and saying if they do catch these guys, they just want to talk to them, yeah, and get them out of the country real quick.
[00:57:25.129 --> 00:57:26.430]  Yeah, you think that's going to fly?
[00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:28.973]  I'll tell you this, it's not going to fly blaming us.
[00:57:28.973 --> 00:57:29.654]  You understand that?
[00:57:30.686 --> 00:57:36.991]  I'm taking your tool, the American people are taking your tool of staging stuff in New Oklahoma cities and we're taking it away.
[00:57:36.991 --> 00:57:40.293]  And you got caught on Fast and Furious, didn't you?
[00:57:40.293 --> 00:57:43.315]  And oh yeah, you were going to blame the Second Amendment, that even came out.
[00:57:43.315 --> 00:57:44.816]  And you got caught on this.
[00:57:44.816 --> 00:57:48.359]  And you're going to get caught on everything you do.
[00:57:48.359 --> 00:57:50.901]  You're going to get caught everywhere and everything you do.
[00:57:51.914 --> 00:57:53.635]  Everybody should search the term false flag.
[00:57:53.635 --> 00:57:55.256]  We should make it the number one search term.
[00:57:55.256 --> 00:57:56.916]  Let's try to do the Google bomb again.
[00:57:56.916 --> 00:58:01.318]  Everybody go into search term at Google and type in false flag and do it over and over again.
[00:58:01.318 --> 00:58:04.600]  All right, I said I'd get to the Badandi clip.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.221]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:58:06.221 --> 00:58:08.502]  We're going to play it when we come back and start the next hour.
[00:58:08.502 --> 00:58:14.164]  And I'm going to recap all the news and go through it and get into the fertilizer bombing, which may have been a real event.
[00:58:14.164 --> 00:58:15.225]  I just had a Freudian slip.
[00:58:16.263 --> 00:58:26.250]  The fertilizer explosion, which may have been a accident, may have really been just a fire that, you know, caused it and did all that, but sure came right on time.
[00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:30.693]  Like I said yesterday, watch them stage some more stuff to cover this up.
[00:58:30.693 --> 00:58:38.158]  They did Waco to cover up the World Trade Center, first attack when the Feds made the bomb and trained the drivers and gave them the detonators and everything.
[00:58:38.158 --> 00:58:40.640]  That was done just a week after that to cover that news up.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:44.323]  So there's no telling how they're going to strike back and we're going to talk about that coming up.
[00:58:44.323 --> 00:58:44.783]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.476 --> 00:58:57.637]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:57.637 --> 00:58:59.578]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:58:59.578 --> 00:59:01.758]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:59:01.758 --> 00:59:07.459]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:59:07.459 --> 00:59:11.500]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:15.441]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:59:15.441 --> 00:59:16.841]  The fact is, you are.
[00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:17.842]  We all are.
[00:59:17.842 --> 00:59:20.182]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:59:20.482 --> 00:59:29.069]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:30.430]  Be prepared before you need it.

[00:59:33.913 --> 00:59:36.315]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[00:59:36.315 --> 00:59:40.878]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.

[01:00:17.228 --> 01:00:18.810]  You want answers?
[01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:20.371]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:20.371 --> 01:00:24.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.555 --> 01:00:29.641]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.641 --> 01:00:34.566]  Max Keiser pops in at the bottom of the hour to get into gold, the economy, bitcoin and more in his take on the bombings.
[01:00:36.209 --> 01:00:41.172]  I'm gonna open the phones up in the third hour for all of you out there.
[01:00:41.172 --> 01:00:44.454]  They're trying to pass SOPA and CISPA right now.
[01:00:44.454 --> 01:00:48.256]  We did shoot down the gun-grabbing bill for now, showing the power of the people.
[01:00:48.256 --> 01:00:52.879]  Biden was doing fake crying, or maybe doing real crying, that their false flag's been exposed.
[01:00:52.879 --> 01:00:54.220]  In our article on InfoWars.com,
[01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:59.242]  Obama covering up Saudi link to Boston bombing.
[01:00:59.242 --> 01:01:03.104]  I love the comment by Anonymous who commented at 11 a.m.
[01:01:03.104 --> 01:01:04.184]  Simple arithmetic.
[01:01:04.184 --> 01:01:05.425]  Guys, you can punch this up.
[01:01:05.425 --> 01:01:06.065]  Thank you.
[01:01:06.065 --> 01:01:07.565]  Simple arithmetic, my friends.
[01:01:07.565 --> 01:01:13.388]  One, orchestrate bombing on Patriots Day in city of original Boston Tea Party.
[01:01:13.388 --> 01:01:16.389]  Two, detonate bombs near the finish line at the end of the race.
[01:01:18.684 --> 01:01:26.688]  Where slow Caucasians trudged forth and not earlier when the Olympic caliber and it goes on.
[01:01:26.688 --> 01:01:39.115]  We're also about to finish line three create major news distractions as banksters crash paper precious metal markets as well as averting media attention from Benghazi investigation as well
[01:01:39.895 --> 01:01:48.361]  As creating opportunity for eventual radical, right-wing, gun-toting, Bible-thumping, middle-aged, white supremacists from Montana.
[01:01:48.361 --> 01:01:51.703]  Fiction, equal future.
[01:01:51.703 --> 01:01:53.965]  More street cameras.
[01:01:53.965 --> 01:01:54.605]  Surveillance.
[01:01:54.605 --> 01:01:57.667]  More wimpy Americans begging for protection.
[01:01:57.667 --> 01:02:00.649]  Institution of martial law, first in Boston, which has now happened.
[01:02:00.649 --> 01:02:03.431]  Globalist Bilderberg, America's begging for protection.
[01:02:03.431 --> 01:02:08.935]  Institution of martial law, first into Boston, and then into other major national metropolitan areas.
[01:02:10.421 --> 01:02:12.962]  And again, I don't read that to be mean to gay people or something.
[01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.063]  I actually hadn't read the full comment.
[01:02:15.063 --> 01:02:16.144]  I thought I would just read one.
[01:02:16.144 --> 01:02:17.024]  This is kind of silly.
[01:02:41.772 --> 01:02:45.456]  And remember, Obama sat at the feet of Bill Ayers, and they got smarter.
[01:02:45.456 --> 01:02:50.241]  Don't blow up people and then take credit and say, look, I scare you, do what I say.
[01:02:50.241 --> 01:02:53.765]  They found out with Hitler's bombing of London, that only makes people want to fight harder.
[01:02:53.765 --> 01:02:55.947]  Blow stuff up and blame it on your enemies.
[01:02:55.947 --> 01:02:58.530]  I mean, that is the oldest trick in the book.
[01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.372]  And of course you have to look at them as
[01:03:03.243 --> 01:03:03.483]  Yes.
[01:03:19.709 --> 01:03:23.892]  They want to get this through, but it was so shoddily done.
[01:03:23.892 --> 01:03:26.534]  Plus, the Navy SEALs aren't involved in this.
[01:03:26.534 --> 01:03:28.575]  The average FBI isn't involved in this.
[01:03:28.575 --> 01:03:30.236]  The Boston cops aren't involved.
[01:03:30.236 --> 01:03:33.738]  That's why you got to have them out there in a drill with a bunch of black backpacks.
[01:03:33.738 --> 01:03:39.722]  Everyone's ordered to stand around in black backpacks and the SEALs are all looking around like, why are we ordered to do this?
[01:03:39.722 --> 01:03:41.023]  So you can put in the
[01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:52.146]  Redneck Patsy and the Saudi Patsy's and then if everything goes well you blame the rednecks but if things don't go well you fall back on the Saudis as I said Monday.
[01:03:52.146 --> 01:04:03.890]  I said they might come out and say rednecks working with Muslims and I said that on record because you know they have the Turban Cowboy episodes on Family Guy and every other show is and the training manuals and the
[01:04:04.949 --> 01:04:08.450]  Preparations, remember the training manuals the Army was given last month?
[01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:12.551]  That Christians are with Al-Qaeda, Catholics and Evangelicals?
[01:04:12.551 --> 01:04:17.013]  And all these shows where the Tea Party works with Al-Qaeda, Founding Fathers, the list goes on and on.
[01:04:17.013 --> 01:04:19.094]  You're like, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:04:19.094 --> 01:04:20.994]  They're getting ready for the branding.
[01:04:20.994 --> 01:04:22.595]  It's a major rollout.
[01:04:22.595 --> 01:04:24.755]  When you know this stuff, it is 100% obvious.
[01:04:27.157 --> 01:04:36.746]  One hundred and ten percent obvious, and I said imminent, imminent, imminent, mass shootings, mass bombings, blaming patriots, imminent, imminent, imminent, imminent.
[01:04:36.746 --> 01:04:44.473]  That day before it happened, Monday on the show, I said imminent attack.
[01:04:44.473 --> 01:04:46.355]  Imminent.
[01:04:46.355 --> 01:04:47.777]  Because I could just see the crescendo
[01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:49.834]  And they couldn't help it.
[01:04:49.834 --> 01:04:54.017]  All the White House connected people, people talk, people brag, like, something big's about to happen.
[01:04:54.017 --> 01:04:57.559]  You've seen all those things they put out saying, yeah, we need a new Oklahoma to blame on our enemies.
[01:04:57.559 --> 01:04:59.380]  Yeah, that would sure help, you know, Robert Shapiro.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.361]  And they couldn't help it.
[01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:04.243]  MSNBC and all of them are like, there's about to be an attack, and you're gonna do it.
[01:05:04.243 --> 01:05:04.984]  Really?
[01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:08.506]  Really, we did it, huh?
[01:05:08.506 --> 01:05:14.350]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:21.989]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[01:08:12.587 --> 01:08:13.887]  Big Brother.
[01:08:13.887 --> 01:08:15.648]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:15.648 --> 01:08:17.410]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:17.410 --> 01:08:19.010]  You want answers?
[01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:20.571]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:20.571 --> 01:08:24.754]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.754 --> 01:08:28.857]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.585 --> 01:08:46.773]  Alright, if you're just joining us, this is the most historic radio broadcast in 18 years I've ever done.
[01:08:48.362 --> 01:08:56.309]  We received from anonymous, and we did Google searches on the photos that confirmed they were from Twitter accounts and news stations that didn't know what they had.
[01:08:56.309 --> 01:09:00.953]  We received from anonymous contact sent to Paul Watson.
[01:09:00.953 --> 01:09:03.436]  We are in contact with the folks that sent us the information.
[01:09:03.436 --> 01:09:06.018]  They've asked that we not mention what hacker group they're with.
[01:09:06.018 --> 01:09:07.599]  We'll just say they're anonymous.
[01:09:07.599 --> 01:09:11.403]  That they went out, and it's obviously intelligence people who don't like what's happening.
[01:09:11.903 --> 01:09:18.448]  That Navy SEALs were there at the event at the finish line all over the place with radiation detectors, black backpacks.
[01:09:18.448 --> 01:09:26.634]  We're talking 20 feet, max 20 yards, between 20 and 60 feet from the bombers right there by the flags.
[01:09:26.634 --> 01:09:29.135]  There was a drill which they've been caught lying about.
[01:09:29.135 --> 01:09:33.739]  They made them cancel their press conference and then say they hadn't caught the guy that did it.
[01:09:34.704 --> 01:09:36.785]  The media should be asking why they did that.
[01:09:36.785 --> 01:09:42.867]  Emergency meetings with the Saudi Foreign Minister last night with Obama.
[01:09:42.867 --> 01:09:45.288]  This is unprecedented cover-up.
[01:09:45.288 --> 01:09:49.749]  Now, what is on the videos and the photos up at Infowars.com?
[01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:53.151]  In the articles, Obama covering up Saudi link to bombing.
[01:09:53.151 --> 01:09:56.512]  Person of interest to be deported after Obama had unscheduled meeting.
[01:09:58.015 --> 01:10:00.357]  With Saudi Foreign Minister.
[01:10:00.357 --> 01:10:08.946]  There are rednecks that have matching black bags that look like the types that went off that we believe they were planning to go with as the Patsy's.
[01:10:08.946 --> 01:10:11.788]  We said then the Saudi Arabians would be ignored.
[01:10:11.788 --> 01:10:13.090]  You're like, well that's just your speculation.
[01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:13.570]  No it's not.
[01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:17.814]  The FBI General Napolitano came out this morning and showed the exact photos we showed
[01:10:18.852 --> 01:10:23.854]  A day later, ladies and gentlemen, saying, here are people of interest.
[01:10:23.854 --> 01:10:25.935]  They're not suspects, but we want to talk to them.
[01:10:25.935 --> 01:10:27.575]  Yeah, they're with their black bags.
[01:10:27.575 --> 01:10:34.418]  You've got Navy SEALs everywhere wearing Navy SEAL hats, identifying which SEAL team they're with, knowing how dumb the public is.
[01:10:34.418 --> 01:10:36.139]  They didn't know what that meant.
[01:10:36.139 --> 01:10:39.360]  In the tan boots, the tan pants, the black shirts.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.061]  This broke yesterday at this time on air.
[01:10:42.499 --> 01:10:52.211]  Uh, you've got other people that look like they are kind of wearing the unofficial plainclothes uniform of Army Special Units, including above Army Delta.
[01:10:52.211 --> 01:10:55.295]  I've just covered this so much, I know what they look like.
[01:10:55.295 --> 01:10:58.478]  And they all kind of go with it when they want to be recognized.
[01:10:59.019 --> 01:11:00.300]  By each other.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:04.202]  It's not an undercover look so much as it's kind of an unofficial uniform.
[01:11:04.202 --> 01:11:14.409]  It looks like... Show people the Delta Force guy, the one hiding in the doorway with the big backpack looking out incredibly suspiciously right there at the finish line, right behind the flags.
[01:11:14.409 --> 01:11:22.454]  I mean, it was just guys everywhere with black bags and loudspeakers saying, no one fear, it's only a drill, it's only a drill.
[01:11:22.454 --> 01:11:23.095]  And people can say, well,
[01:11:24.588 --> 01:11:26.731]  They were trying to stop the Saudi guys.
[01:11:26.731 --> 01:11:28.513]  Really, they could have just grabbed them right then and then.
[01:11:28.513 --> 01:11:32.117]  I mean, anybody could walk up to suspicious people with big black backpacks.
[01:11:32.117 --> 01:11:33.018]  They let them get away.
[01:11:34.073 --> 01:11:37.836]  They were planning to blame the rednecks, ladies and gentlemen, and how do I know that?
[01:11:37.836 --> 01:11:56.049]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, White House run, on record, came out a month ago and said, Mr. President, we only told Clinton this one month before the Oklahoma City bombing, because we're so smart, we're heroes, that this is the anti-gun, anti-America group that demonizes Ron Paul, myself, anybody that loves freedom, and basically says we're bad guys.
[01:11:56.049 --> 01:12:01.774]  They said, sir, the right wing, the Tea Party, is going to imminently engage in terror attacks.
[01:12:01.774 --> 01:12:03.155]  It's imminent, they're going to bomb.
[01:12:03.834 --> 01:12:04.934]  And I said, that's it!
[01:12:04.934 --> 01:12:07.115]  They ran Elohim City, where McVeigh was at.
[01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:08.636]  It came out in federal documents.
[01:12:08.636 --> 01:12:11.217]  They were over that group.
[01:12:11.217 --> 01:12:13.478]  Carol Howe, all of it came out.
[01:12:13.478 --> 01:12:15.078]  They're deadly dangerous.
[01:12:15.078 --> 01:12:17.999]  They're the private government group.
[01:12:17.999 --> 01:12:19.800]  And I said, that's it, it's imminent.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.721]  And then they started saying the last few weeks, the Tea Party's gonna shoot and blow things up.
[01:12:23.721 --> 01:12:25.902]  And told state police this all over the country.
[01:12:25.902 --> 01:12:27.883]  And said, prepare to take Christians' guns.
[01:12:27.883 --> 01:12:29.124]  Will you confiscate their guns?
[01:12:29.124 --> 01:12:29.984]  That's Fox News.
[01:12:31.966 --> 01:12:35.550]  And it started waking the police up going, what do you mean the Christians are going to have an uprising?
[01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:37.472]  What are you talking about?
[01:12:37.472 --> 01:12:38.973]  Because they're going to blame this on us.
[01:12:38.973 --> 01:12:43.017]  That's why I said it's imminent.
[01:12:43.017 --> 01:12:51.967]  I was able to tell you on air yesterday, it's on record, there's video and audio of it showing the Saudi Arabians, saying those look like Saudi Arabians to me, and that's a cut out.
[01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:53.648]  People go, well why would they have...
[01:12:54.676 --> 01:13:02.023]  Why would they have rednecks, and Saudis, and Navy SEALs, and police, and special army forces?
[01:13:02.023 --> 01:13:06.326]  Probably Delta.
[01:13:06.326 --> 01:13:11.431]  Why would they, why would they have, well that guy looks like Delta Force, I've never seen one.
[01:13:11.431 --> 01:13:13.092]  Why would they, there's the Patsy.
[01:13:13.092 --> 01:13:15.655]  Why would they have all of this going on?
[01:13:18.055 --> 01:13:22.679]  At the same time, that way there's fallback plans, because they don't tell the SEALs what's happening.
[01:13:22.679 --> 01:13:24.560]  They say, you're part of a drill.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.661]  Come to this area.
[01:13:25.661 --> 01:13:27.122]  They tell the police, you're part of a drill.
[01:13:27.122 --> 01:13:27.883]  Come to this area.
[01:13:27.883 --> 01:13:33.788]  So you got 20, 30, 40 guys with black backpacks, so that no one knows who really bombed everything.
[01:13:33.788 --> 01:13:37.150]  That's a classic fog of war tactic they do.
[01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:37.831]  Oklahoma City.
[01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:55.139]  They had white supremacists, they had special forces sheet-dipped, they had German intelligence, they had Canadians there, they had CIA people there, they had ATF people there, they had FBI there, the FBI counter-terrorism director was there, got caught lying, saying he wasn't.
[01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:58.060]  He was there the day before, that came out in court.
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.881]  All there, one minute after the bombing!
[01:14:00.881 --> 01:14:03.743]  And cops that pulled up, Terence Yakey, Don Browning and others,
[01:14:04.684 --> 01:14:06.227]  The head of the TANON unit went, what are you doing?
[01:14:06.227 --> 01:14:07.630]  They're like, watch your mouth or we'll kill you.
[01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:08.191]  That's what we're doing.
[01:14:08.191 --> 01:14:10.395]  I mean, cops are smart.
[01:14:10.395 --> 01:14:11.758]  They're like, what are you doing in bomb gear?
[01:14:11.758 --> 01:14:12.840]  That takes 20 minutes.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.601]  What are you doing here?
[01:14:13.601 --> 01:14:15.124]  Were you running a sting?
[01:14:15.124 --> 01:14:16.547]  You keep your mouth shut, boy!
[01:14:17.793 --> 01:14:19.453]  They ran a drill that morning.
[01:14:19.453 --> 01:14:23.014]  There were federal buildings warned the day before on that morning of a bombing.
[01:14:23.014 --> 01:14:24.335]  They even put a warning out.
[01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:27.015]  So, ooh, man, our superiors warned us of this.
[01:14:27.015 --> 01:14:28.336]  Oh, they warned you?
[01:14:28.336 --> 01:14:31.337]  They planted the stinkin' plastic explosives inside.
[01:14:31.337 --> 01:14:33.257]  And a bunch of them didn't go off.
[01:14:33.257 --> 01:14:35.118]  And the Ryder truck was the diversion.
[01:14:35.118 --> 01:14:36.798]  See, I study these people.
[01:14:36.798 --> 01:14:39.799]  I'm risking my life to tell you this.
[01:14:42.324 --> 01:14:51.048]  They've killed cops, and medical examiners, and medical people in Oklahoma City that tried to expose this.
[01:14:51.048 --> 01:14:53.809]  They killed a bunch of the first responders, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:53.809 --> 01:14:55.830]  But this isn't 1995.
[01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:58.731]  There are photos everywhere, and you think we're so stupid.
[01:14:58.731 --> 01:15:04.833]  You're going to have everyone crawling all over the place, and then you're going to have your patsies, who were probably told,
[01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:11.378]  You're in trouble for this gun charge, Mr. Brown, or whatever their name is.
[01:15:11.378 --> 01:15:14.619]  Go help us in drills, and we'll drop the charges.
[01:15:14.619 --> 01:15:17.860]  That's how we've caught them doing that with Randy Weaver and others.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:20.401]  They're like, alright, I want to serve my country.
[01:15:20.401 --> 01:15:29.484]  Good, good, because they know the guy's on welfare, probably got a 75 IQ, low-grade moron, mentally retarded, mildly, but is able to keep a job.
[01:15:29.484 --> 01:15:34.426]  There's lots of working people that are actually retarded out there, who come from families that make them work.
[01:15:35.086 --> 01:15:39.070]  I mean, the guy looks like he's got about a 75, max 80 IQ.
[01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:44.596]  And I said, I said, OK, it'll be these Saudis, it'll be these guys, and they're going to have the fallback now.
[01:15:44.596 --> 01:15:49.181]  But I don't know how they can announce that they've arrested these guys, because now everyone's going to point out these photos.
[01:15:49.181 --> 01:15:50.842]  And they're listing live time to the show.
[01:15:50.842 --> 01:15:53.065]  They flip out and then cancel the press conference.
[01:15:56.172 --> 01:15:58.534]  That's how immersed in this, ladies and gentlemen, I am.
[01:15:58.534 --> 01:16:10.385]  Again, I told you yesterday, these Saudi Arabians, they're Saudi Arabians, now they're saying they think they're Saudi Arabians, they don't want you to know about this, but now they're going to be forced to show you these photos.
[01:16:10.385 --> 01:16:12.006]  Sure enough, they did.
[01:16:12.006 --> 01:16:14.429]  And again, how do I know what they were planning?
[01:16:14.429 --> 01:16:15.510]  This is the most important point.
[01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:25.736]  Because every outlet run by the White House, from MSNBC to Media Matters, to the Southern Primary Law Center, came out in the last month really cocky.
[01:16:25.736 --> 01:16:27.696]  It's not like they're brought into the meeting and told what's going to happen.
[01:16:27.696 --> 01:16:30.638]  They're just like, okay, the right wing's going to get exposed now.
[01:16:30.638 --> 01:16:32.019]  Talk about how they're going to stage terror.
[01:16:32.019 --> 01:16:34.220]  It's in every show, every TV.
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:40.543]  Hollywood's gotten the memo, from Family Guy to Founding Fathers to The Following to, you know, medical shows.
[01:16:40.543 --> 01:16:42.524]  The patriots are going to bomb you.
[01:16:42.524 --> 01:16:43.284]  They're going to shoot you.
[01:16:44.855 --> 01:16:48.616]  They're going to blow up your sporting event because they believe in George Washington.
[01:16:48.616 --> 01:16:49.597]  I mean, it's obvious.
[01:16:49.597 --> 01:16:52.197]  The whole scripting targeting the dumb public.
[01:16:52.197 --> 01:16:53.598]  The dumbed-down public.
[01:16:53.598 --> 01:16:54.358]  And boom!
[01:16:54.358 --> 01:16:56.859]  It happens and I see these photos.
[01:16:56.859 --> 01:16:58.659]  Anonymous was right to send them to us.
[01:16:58.659 --> 01:17:01.320]  We hammer them out there and they still haven't shown all the others.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.462]  They are freaking out right now.
[01:17:05.462 --> 01:17:09.623]  AbsoluteDrugsReport.com is the only major media outlet that has picked this up.
[01:17:11.172 --> 01:17:23.244]  The only major media outlet that has picked this up is the DrudgeReport.com, left-hand side, has our article and link to our article about the photos rocking the internet last night and this morning.
[01:17:23.244 --> 01:17:34.635]  The photos that we posted at Infowars.com that are linked to Paul's new article, Obama covering up Saudi-linked Boston bombing, which then forced The Blaze to finally report on all this, which is our plan.
[01:17:35.543 --> 01:17:37.484]  See, we're not trying to scoop you, Glenn.
[01:17:37.484 --> 01:17:39.105]  We want to make you cover the truth.
[01:17:39.105 --> 01:17:40.665]  Why don't you apologize to me?
[01:17:40.665 --> 01:17:43.707]  You spent 30 minutes attacking me yesterday, saying I was making this up.
[01:17:43.707 --> 01:17:46.628]  That's not about two talk shows fighting with each other.
[01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:51.370]  Just admit you take your information from my show and then twist it for your own uses.
[01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:52.651]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:17:52.651 --> 01:17:54.612]  You're not going to bury this information.
[01:17:57.350 --> 01:18:01.435]  We could bring down this entire operation, but he's too scared to do it.
[01:18:01.435 --> 01:18:08.183]  If we could get Limbaugh, and if we could get Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity to talk about this, it is over for these people.
[01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:08.784]  It is over.
[01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:10.406]  I mean, by the way, this is dangerous.
[01:18:11.328 --> 01:18:15.892]  By the way, there's no telling what the globalists may stage now to bring in tyranny.
[01:18:15.892 --> 01:18:18.174]  I want to go out to break with Dan Bodondi at the press conference.
[01:18:18.174 --> 01:18:19.595]  Part of it will come back with more.
[01:18:19.595 --> 01:18:25.640]  The night of the event, and instantly when he brings up false flag, they turn and get freaked out when they talk about the drill.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.301]  Acting guilty as sin.
[01:18:27.301 --> 01:18:29.062]  That was another big tell-tale sign.
[01:18:29.062 --> 01:18:32.465]  I went from maybe a false flag to 99% it is.
[01:18:32.465 --> 01:18:34.507]  And the evidence just piles and piles.
[01:18:34.507 --> 01:18:36.569]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:18:36.569 --> 01:18:38.850]  Is there any security footage of any of these explosions?
[01:18:40.209 --> 01:18:41.971]  We are looking at all of that right now.
[01:18:41.971 --> 01:18:44.294]  That's one of the investigative steps that we're taking.
[01:18:44.294 --> 01:18:45.635]  Was there any play in the Oligo?
[01:18:45.635 --> 01:18:52.303]  Because according to BostonGlobe.com, they said they were doing drills this morning for the same exact thing to happen, according to BostonGlobe.com.
[01:18:52.303 --> 01:18:55.807]  Now, were you guys given any warning ahead of time of this taking place?
[01:18:56.187 --> 01:18:58.768]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence.
[01:18:58.768 --> 01:19:02.530]  We certainly increased our posture around a big event like this.
[01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:07.893]  All of those things happened in preparation for this event, but there was no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen.
[01:19:07.893 --> 01:19:11.294]  Can you talk a little bit about what type of device do you have?
[01:19:11.294 --> 01:19:16.437]  The city of Boston is open and will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual.
[01:19:16.437 --> 01:19:24.140]  It will be a heightened law enforcement presence consistent with the severity and seriousness of the ongoing investigation.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.021]  People should expect
[01:19:25.781 --> 01:19:34.912]  We're going to come back with the rest.
[01:19:34.912 --> 01:19:41.780]  If people ask what the goal is, distract the war crime indictment by the Congressional Committee of Obama and Bush Jr.
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:45.044]  for torture and ordering it and then ordering a cover-up.
[01:19:45.905 --> 01:19:58.236]  Uh, cover up for Benghazi, uh, cover up to get the gun stuff passed, cover up on the economy, and a way to roll out martial law, which they were already doing with troops on the streets, uh, checking your junk for al-Qaeda bombs.
[01:19:58.236 --> 01:20:02.320]  Uh, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the rest of this key audio.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.741]  Max Keiser coming up.
[01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:05.923]  But we have caught them.
[01:20:05.923 --> 01:20:06.284]  Stay with us.
[01:20:08.055 --> 01:20:13.278]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:22:38.235 --> 01:22:42.798]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:42.798 --> 01:22:48.602]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:48.602 --> 01:22:52.244]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:52.244 --> 01:22:54.966]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:07.194 --> 01:23:11.957]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:11.957 --> 01:23:14.979]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:14.979 --> 01:23:23.964]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:23.964 --> 01:23:28.867]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:23:40.876 --> 01:23:47.885]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:48.545 --> 01:23:51.527]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:55.729]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your planes?
[01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:56.949]  You're the pretender!
[01:24:19.841 --> 01:24:31.089]  Well, Infowars.com broke internationally in the news, and the Drudge Report broke it even bigger.
[01:24:31.089 --> 01:24:49.541]  The photos of the people from Saudi Arabia, they believe, who are the main suspects in the bombing, and they have cancelled press conferences and had said they'd arrested who they thought did it, and now that's all supposed to be forgot and no media will cover it, and it's supposedly nothing's happened here.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.962]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, if a small town TV station broke who the guys were and found the photos, it'd be all over the news.
[01:24:55.962 --> 01:25:00.963]  They don't want everybody coming to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:25:00.963 --> 01:25:04.304]  So we have to have our writers write articles explaining what just happened.
[01:25:04.304 --> 01:25:08.525]  Do you understand how big this is?
[01:25:08.525 --> 01:25:14.367]  They have been caught running a drill that witnesses saw and heard saying, don't worry, don't worry about the backpacks, it's just a drill.
[01:25:15.413 --> 01:25:30.031]  As the cops and military stand around with their own backpacks, their own black backpacks, while Saudis and some white hillbilly types are there as the patsies, and the media was getting ready yesterday before this came out, going, yeah, looks like it's lone wolf, oh.
[01:25:30.896 --> 01:25:34.538]  And MSNBC, everybody's like, yeah, it's about to be the Tea Party, like we told you!
[01:25:34.538 --> 01:25:37.260]  Oh, the arrest has been made!
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:40.662]  Gonna have a press conference at the courthouse!
[01:25:40.662 --> 01:25:44.865]  Then they went, oh, forget that, we don't have anybody, there's no press conference, we gotta meet with the Saudis!
[01:25:44.865 --> 01:25:48.848]  I mean, unraveling!
[01:25:48.848 --> 01:25:53.171]  In front of everyone, and false flags, one of the top search terms.
[01:25:53.171 --> 01:25:55.832]  And they're just hoping they can get away with this.
[01:25:55.832 --> 01:25:57.413]  Imagine the magnitude.
[01:25:57.413 --> 01:25:59.195]  This shows you how controlled the media is.
[01:26:00.202 --> 01:26:04.766]  That only Infowars.com and DrudgeReport.com are covering this.
[01:26:04.766 --> 01:26:09.351]  And the photos we released are the photos they were forced to then put out.
[01:26:09.351 --> 01:26:11.213]  The very photos a day later.
[01:26:12.383 --> 01:26:19.166]  But they won't say... The media stands around to wait until the government gives them a photo and ignores, hey, who was right?
[01:26:19.166 --> 01:26:20.867]  Not, wow, good job!
[01:26:20.867 --> 01:26:28.511]  Infowars.com, Paul Watson, Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Matt Drudge's crew.
[01:26:28.511 --> 01:26:35.674]  It'd be like Drudge breaking Monica Lewinsky again, and them not saying Drudge broke it.
[01:26:35.674 --> 01:26:38.476]  But this is the government, or the criminal elements of it,
[01:26:39.488 --> 01:26:48.012]  Creating their standard drill, where you've got a bunch of decoys, and they use Navy SEALs and what looks like Army Special Forces.
[01:26:48.012 --> 01:26:51.094]  I've been to so many of these events, I've learned how the Army dresses in there.
[01:26:51.094 --> 01:26:52.355]  It's a uniform, but it's not.
[01:26:52.355 --> 01:26:58.938]  The public's so disconnected, it's not obvious the guys are wearing uniforms, they really are.
[01:26:58.938 --> 01:27:01.159]  It's Navy SEAL insignias, all of it.
[01:27:01.159 --> 01:27:02.920]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:27:04.858 --> 01:27:05.779]  And we're sitting here.
[01:27:05.779 --> 01:27:06.780]  This is the story.
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:08.261]  They've lied about the drill.
[01:27:08.261 --> 01:27:12.123]  They've lied about it all to my reporter that was all over national news.
[01:27:12.123 --> 01:27:14.605]  That didn't make the news?
[01:27:14.605 --> 01:27:19.669]  Or they said, Alex, the mega troll Jones and his troll heckled.
[01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:20.230]  Oh, really?
[01:27:20.230 --> 01:27:21.210]  Hey, there's a drill.
[01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:22.491]  Eyewitnesses.
[01:27:22.491 --> 01:27:23.092]  What about the drill?
[01:27:23.092 --> 01:27:27.195]  There was no drill and there was no prior knowledge.
[01:27:27.195 --> 01:27:29.416]  Liars, liars, liars.
[01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:30.457]  This is so big.
[01:27:30.457 --> 01:27:34.060]  Let's go back to Dan Bodondi, Monday night, Infowars.com reporter.
[01:27:35.287 --> 01:27:38.088]  And again, I don't even want the credit for this.
[01:27:38.088 --> 01:27:41.790]  I want the media to start focusing on, look at these other photos.
[01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:43.390]  Look, that's right by the flagpoles.
[01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:44.971]  That's right by the bomb.
[01:27:44.971 --> 01:27:49.512]  Cops with big black backpacks looking right at the other guys.
[01:27:49.512 --> 01:27:51.373]  I mean, the cops were searching everybody there.
[01:27:51.373 --> 01:27:52.974]  Why didn't you search the rednecks?
[01:27:52.974 --> 01:27:54.534]  Why didn't you search the Saudis?
[01:27:54.534 --> 01:27:57.916]  Why don't you want these photos out if you're not involved?
[01:27:57.916 --> 01:27:59.716]  This is hiding in plain view.
[01:27:59.716 --> 01:28:01.117]  Let's go back to the Club of Dambadandi.
[01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:07.519]  The city of Boston is open and will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual.
[01:28:07.519 --> 01:28:15.083]  There will be law enforcement presence consistent with the severity and seriousness of the ongoing investigation.
[01:28:15.083 --> 01:28:22.808]  People should expect, those who are riding the T, that there will be random checks of backpacks and other parcels.
[01:28:23.888 --> 01:28:28.412]  And we just ask everyone to be patient with that inconvenience for the time being.
[01:28:28.412 --> 01:28:30.834]  It is for the public's safety.
[01:28:30.834 --> 01:28:40.081]  Here in the state, at the local level, and at the federal level, we are all coming together to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this.
[01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:45.745]  The most important fact that I want to convey to everybody this evening has already been mentioned by Governor Patrick.
[01:28:45.745 --> 01:28:47.987]  The FBI is taking the lead in this investigation.
[01:28:48.467 --> 01:28:50.988]  It is asserting federal jurisdiction.
[01:28:50.988 --> 01:29:00.052]  It will do so through the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force, members of which are comprised by all the members of the law enforcement agencies here represented at the podium.
[01:29:00.052 --> 01:29:03.313]  This will be a combined federal, state, and local effort.
[01:29:03.313 --> 01:29:05.614]  It will be an ongoing investigation.
[01:29:05.614 --> 01:29:11.837]  It is a criminal investigation that is a potential terrorist investigation.
[01:29:12.777 --> 01:29:13.917]  If you take any questions.
[01:29:13.917 --> 01:29:19.439]  I'm sorry, why are we loudspeakers telling people in the audience to be calm moments before the bomb went off?
[01:29:19.439 --> 01:29:25.900]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland security by sticking our hands down on the pants on the streets?
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:26.620]  No.
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:27.280]  Next question.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.761]  You have said that there is no suspect but a third party.
[01:29:29.761 --> 01:29:31.101]  I'm not going to confirm that right now.
[01:29:31.101 --> 01:29:33.302]  We'll have that information for you first thing in the morning.
[01:29:33.302 --> 01:29:35.102]  The medical people are compiling that as we speak.
[01:29:35.342 --> 01:29:39.066]  Again, why we speak is telling people to be... Sir?
[01:29:39.066 --> 01:29:47.615]  We're going to come back with the rest of this and then Max Keiser, but he says at the end this is a false flag gentleman.
[01:29:48.376 --> 01:29:50.138]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a false flag.
[01:29:50.138 --> 01:29:51.661]  We don't know exactly who did it.
[01:29:51.661 --> 01:29:55.386]  We know the government was running it, and is now covering it up in plain view.
[01:29:55.386 --> 01:29:57.228]  This thing is fully blown wide open.
[01:29:57.228 --> 01:29:58.630]  We're on the march.
[01:29:58.630 --> 01:29:59.691]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:59.691 --> 01:30:01.173]  This is history happening, folks.
[01:30:01.173 --> 01:30:02.836]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.836 --> 01:30:04.117]  We can't probably defeat them with this.
[01:30:04.117 --> 01:30:05.019]  This could destroy them.
[01:30:07.853 --> 01:30:09.794]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:30:09.794 --> 01:30:12.215]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:30:12.215 --> 01:30:17.677]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:30:17.677 --> 01:30:21.719]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:30:21.719 --> 01:30:25.661]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:30:25.661 --> 01:30:27.041]  The fact is, you are.
[01:30:27.041 --> 01:30:28.062]  We all are.
[01:30:28.062 --> 01:30:30.403]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:30:30.703 --> 01:30:39.265]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:30:39.265 --> 01:30:40.645]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:30:40.645 --> 01:30:44.126]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:30:44.126 --> 01:30:46.506]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:30:46.506 --> 01:30:51.067]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.

[01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:16.395]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:32:16.395 --> 01:32:20.077]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:32:20.077 --> 01:32:24.539]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:29.242]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[01:33:19.316 --> 01:33:24.257]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:24.257 --> 01:33:36.081]  Alright, Max Kaiser was going to be on with us, but his Skype's not working and we're seeing if we can get him on cell phone.
[01:33:37.182 --> 01:33:39.563]  But regardless, I'm going to be covering the news here.
[01:33:39.563 --> 01:33:41.744]  I want you to understand something.
[01:33:41.744 --> 01:33:46.806]  I tend to get up here when we have ultra-massive news and kind of calmly report it.
[01:33:46.806 --> 01:33:50.028]  Or to be more accurate, I'm just excited all the time.
[01:33:50.028 --> 01:33:52.609]  But this is over the top.
[01:33:52.609 --> 01:33:58.712]  I mean, this is so incredible that in the 21st century you have the real birth of the citizen media.
[01:33:59.864 --> 01:34:05.345]  Where everybody is out there, by the millions, seeing the Navy SEALs, seeing the handlers.
[01:34:05.345 --> 01:34:09.606]  There's new photos that looks like cops handling the patsies, bringing them in.
[01:34:09.606 --> 01:34:14.447]  Obviously, these goofy looking guys with backpacks, the cops would be all over them.
[01:34:14.447 --> 01:34:16.947]  That's why they're telling people, be calm, this is just a drill.
[01:34:16.947 --> 01:34:19.388]  Never mind the weirdos with big black backpacks.
[01:34:19.388 --> 01:34:21.408]  Never mind people leaving them right there.
[01:34:21.408 --> 01:34:22.148]  Just a drill.
[01:34:22.148 --> 01:34:26.509]  Now, cops, we're told to get back, just for our safety though.
[01:34:28.632 --> 01:34:30.793]  And the cops get back and it blows up.
[01:34:30.793 --> 01:34:35.996]  I mean, folks, now people know what they're looking for, and the system, of course, knew the whole time.
[01:34:35.996 --> 01:34:37.396]  It's full of Navy SEALs.
[01:34:37.396 --> 01:34:38.657]  It's full of Army.
[01:34:38.657 --> 01:34:42.419]  It's full of undercover police everywhere with big black backpacks.
[01:34:42.419 --> 01:34:47.802]  And then you see after the bombs go off, they're directing things.
[01:34:47.802 --> 01:34:51.744]  In fact, I never have a tightness in my throat and kind of an anxiety.
[01:34:51.744 --> 01:34:56.306]  I haven't had anxiety like that since I was like, you know, 14, getting a date with the best-looking cheerleader, you know, and you're
[01:34:57.416 --> 01:34:59.958]  And you're, you know, going to the movies where they're getting dropped off by her parents.
[01:34:59.958 --> 01:35:03.660]  You kind of get that tightness in your throat before you reach over and kiss her.
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:05.661]  I'm having butterflies, okay?
[01:35:05.661 --> 01:35:10.063]  And I'm somebody that's spoken to crowds of 5,000 people and I don't get butterflies.
[01:35:10.063 --> 01:35:14.446]  I go on The View and I don't get butterflies talking to 20 million people.
[01:35:14.446 --> 01:35:19.629]  Right now, I'm having so many butterflies that I'm actually hyperventilating on air, okay?
[01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:24.092]  I mean, that's how big this is.
[01:35:24.092 --> 01:35:24.332]  Because
[01:35:27.148 --> 01:35:32.470]  This is like catching people, again, burying the dead bodies on film in the backyard.
[01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:35.571]  This is open and shut, smoking gun.
[01:35:35.571 --> 01:35:44.894]  You call in all these people, you ask who ordered them to do what, you'll find out who was in charge, you'll find out who was handling who, you'll find out who did this and who blew up the marathon.
[01:35:44.894 --> 01:35:50.096]  I mean, we're sitting here, this will destroy the globalists, if this comes out.
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:36:01.282]  And you notice no media is going, wow, Alex Jones, of all people, got the photos of who they say they're looking for now.
[01:36:01.282 --> 01:36:05.443]  Why didn't the media over several days?
[01:36:05.443 --> 01:36:11.664]  And you think I'm so busy, you know, you think I'd be looking at this stuff close.
[01:36:11.664 --> 01:36:14.625]  And it was all hiding in plain view in front of everyone.
[01:36:14.625 --> 01:36:18.986]  Dude just came in here during the break, that's why I'm hyperventilating, with a stack of new high-def photos.
[01:36:21.122 --> 01:36:27.748]  And stills out of the City of Boston surveillance footage, and it shows the handlers of the Saudis.
[01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:31.911]  And you can see the body language, all of it.
[01:36:31.911 --> 01:36:33.713]  And again, people say, oh, you're just speculating.
[01:36:33.713 --> 01:36:39.758]  Oh, I told you who they would be forced to release with the Saudis.
[01:36:39.758 --> 01:36:43.061]  I told you the Navy SEAL stuff, that's now all over the place.
[01:36:44.316 --> 01:36:50.259]  Let's finish up with Badandi, but first I want to show this image here for everybody.
[01:36:50.259 --> 01:36:56.123]  There's an article up at Infowars.com titled, Papers, Please, in Boston.
[01:36:56.123 --> 01:37:03.427]  And it shows 1938 Germany with young soldiers, two of them together, going through people's papers.
[01:37:03.427 --> 01:37:09.410]  And then it shows Boston, USA, 2013 with two young MPs.
[01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:10.651]  I mean, they look like they know they could be 20.
[01:37:11.471 --> 01:37:18.758]  With satisfied power trip looks, searching a businessman and checking his papers.
[01:37:18.758 --> 01:37:20.900]  Let me tell you something, MPs.
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.482]  You're not searching anything, okay?
[01:37:22.482 --> 01:37:24.164]  Your boss has killed those people.
[01:37:24.164 --> 01:37:25.325]  Let me get that through your brain.
[01:37:25.325 --> 01:37:26.686]  Their son.
[01:37:26.686 --> 01:37:27.747]  Son!
[01:37:27.747 --> 01:37:30.590]  This is America, and I'm sick of your garbage!
[01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:35.015]  And I'm sick of the TSA, and I'm sick of all of it while the border is wide open!
[01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:37.831]  It's called a gambit, boys.
[01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:39.031]  You say you're soldiers.
[01:37:39.031 --> 01:37:40.412]  Let me, let me teach you.
[01:37:40.412 --> 01:37:43.533]  Being a soldier means you know history and you know the enemy.
[01:37:43.533 --> 01:37:48.775]  The Iranians of today are the Persians of 4,000 years ago.
[01:37:48.775 --> 01:37:54.557]  And they developed in chess from a military move with horsemen called a gambit.
[01:37:54.557 --> 01:38:02.280]  A gambit is with your, and it's what most chess masters use a lot of times, sacrificing players to suck you in and defeat you.
[01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:09.332]  And you put a gambit is a pawn or a chess move mirroring cavalry.
[01:38:09.332 --> 01:38:17.835]  Where you put cavalry in where they will be enveloped and destroyed because the enemy can't help going out and destroying a force.
[01:38:17.835 --> 01:38:20.516]  Let's say you got a pincer attack ready.
[01:38:20.516 --> 01:38:24.498]  You want to see the main military force revealed from behind the hill.
[01:38:24.498 --> 01:38:26.079]  They didn't have satellite back then.
[01:38:26.079 --> 01:38:28.980]  Believe me kids, they didn't 3,000 plus years ago.
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:29.800]  You send them out.
[01:38:32.245 --> 01:38:34.846]  And the gambit works this way.
[01:38:34.846 --> 01:38:38.888]  And there's different types of gambits, but it's a basic horse move, as the Iranians did it.
[01:38:38.888 --> 01:38:44.690]  You send them out, it calls out the main force, they unify, now you have a chance to launch a pincer on them.
[01:38:44.690 --> 01:38:47.791]  Because they've unified, coming in to destroy the force.
[01:38:47.791 --> 01:38:53.673]  Or you've tricked them to come down off the hills they're on, to destroy your force, to get them in low ground, so you can now attack.
[01:38:53.673 --> 01:38:56.614]  And it's also an Alexander the Great move, that he used a lot.
[01:38:56.614 --> 01:39:01.016]  It's just basic, basic gambit, Iranian term, Persian term,
[01:39:02.481 --> 01:39:15.489]  So, in standard warfare, go back to World War I, they would send in a unit, or several units, hundreds of men, sometimes whole platoons, to be wiped out into a trench area that was disputed, knowing they'd all be killed.
[01:39:15.489 --> 01:39:18.711]  And they would order them on what they called suicide missions.
[01:39:18.711 --> 01:39:21.093]  You've heard of suicide missions?
[01:39:21.093 --> 01:39:23.935]  This is how these generals, like Lemonsir, were ready to bomb U.S.
[01:39:23.935 --> 01:39:27.497]  movie theaters, to blame it on Cuba, and kill Americans.
[01:39:27.497 --> 01:39:30.579]  Ward Cleaver and, you know, leave it to Beaver.
[01:39:32.048 --> 01:39:33.389]  Wall-E.
[01:39:33.389 --> 01:39:34.829]  That's what 1950s were.
[01:39:34.829 --> 01:39:36.450]  Blow up Wall-E at the movie.
[01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:37.331]  Plastic Explosives.
[01:39:37.331 --> 01:39:39.291]  Deployment on the commies.
[01:39:39.291 --> 01:39:41.633]  And they said it's a gambit.
[01:39:41.633 --> 01:39:44.494]  We may even lose 10 million Americans, but we'll defeat communism.
[01:39:44.494 --> 01:39:49.116]  They were ready to lose 10 million Americans in the Russian counter-strike.
[01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:50.877]  Dr. Strangelove is actually based on true stories.
[01:39:50.877 --> 01:39:51.757]  You see that movie?
[01:39:51.757 --> 01:39:53.738]  It's based on Curtis LeMay and L.L.
[01:39:53.738 --> 01:39:57.600]  Lemnitzer, who plays the part of Jack T. Ripper, and all of it.
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:58.661]  That Stanley Kubrick movie.
[01:39:58.661 --> 01:40:00.261]  That's real, folks.
[01:40:00.261 --> 01:40:01.142]  That almost happened.
[01:40:02.348 --> 01:40:02.888]  In 1961.
[01:40:02.888 --> 01:40:06.890]  The film came out two years later.
[01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:08.070]  I'm giving you history here.
[01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:13.012]  And a gambit is to sacrifice maybe 20, 30, 100 horsemen to draw out the enemy.
[01:40:13.012 --> 01:40:17.614]  And the argument is, you save thousands of your cavalry and win the battle.
[01:40:17.614 --> 01:40:20.435]  So in military, it's called a sacrifice.
[01:40:20.435 --> 01:40:21.675]  And that's what they did.
[01:40:21.675 --> 01:40:22.876]  And they
[01:40:24.795 --> 01:40:29.058]  Generally, we'll use a foreign intelligence unit to actually do the bombing.
[01:40:29.058 --> 01:40:33.020]  Like the Saudis, who they used on 9-11 to then take the blame.
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:34.341]  Those Saudis were trained in U.S.
[01:40:34.341 --> 01:40:34.681]  bases.
[01:40:34.681 --> 01:40:39.104]  That came out in mainstream news.
[01:40:39.104 --> 01:40:41.806]  So, this is the information we're talking about.
[01:40:41.806 --> 01:40:42.306]  There it is.
[01:40:42.306 --> 01:40:42.787]  Gambit.
[01:40:42.787 --> 01:40:48.951]  A opening chess move in which a player risks one or more pawns or a minor piece to gain an advantage in position.
[01:40:50.103 --> 01:40:53.730]  A remark intended to start a conversation or make a telling point.
[01:40:53.730 --> 01:40:54.993]  A calculated move.
[01:40:54.993 --> 01:40:57.618]  There you go.
[01:41:00.154 --> 01:41:03.256]  And I'm not going to sit here and rant and rave about this anymore.
[01:41:03.256 --> 01:41:05.858]  The point is, they had a drill.
[01:41:05.858 --> 01:41:08.380]  They were all around the guys with the bombs.
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.962]  There's video and photos of it all.
[01:41:10.962 --> 01:41:16.026]  There's video of undercover police, it looks like, leading the mentally ill.
[01:41:16.026 --> 01:41:17.427]  That's what the guy looks like to me.
[01:41:17.427 --> 01:41:18.368]  Body language, all of it.
[01:41:18.368 --> 01:41:22.571]  Leading up the poor Patsy, who probably thought he was a secret agent now.
[01:41:22.571 --> 01:41:26.153]  He looks so proud to be on Team America.
[01:41:26.153 --> 01:41:29.296]  He doesn't know he's going to be drugged up and rolled out as the new McVeigh.
[01:41:30.729 --> 01:41:37.336]  And gonna be electroshocked, tortured, drugged up for trial, just like all the other patsies.
[01:41:37.336 --> 01:41:38.518]  It's so horrible.
[01:41:38.518 --> 01:41:39.799]  And you know what?
[01:41:39.799 --> 01:41:41.181]  The operation was blown for you.
[01:41:42.145 --> 01:41:43.825]  This is unprecedented.
[01:41:43.825 --> 01:41:46.126]  So now they're going to say, oh, maybe it's Saudis.
[01:41:46.126 --> 01:41:47.826]  Oh, we sent them back to Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:47.826 --> 01:41:48.606]  Never mind.
[01:41:48.606 --> 01:41:50.027]  Oh, we met with the Saudi foreign minister.
[01:41:50.027 --> 01:41:51.047]  Emergency meeting.
[01:41:51.047 --> 01:41:53.627]  We canceled the press conference.
[01:41:53.627 --> 01:41:54.768]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:41:54.768 --> 01:41:55.708]  On and on and on.
[01:41:55.708 --> 01:41:57.068]  They do not want this out.
[01:41:57.068 --> 01:41:58.388]  They do not want this discussed.
[01:41:58.388 --> 01:42:00.149]  They do not want you talking about it.
[01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.809]  They do not.
[01:42:00.809 --> 01:42:05.910]  They needed to blame the Patriot Tea Party for this so bad.
[01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:07.430]  And again, how did I know they were going to blame us?
[01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:09.011]  Patriots Day, Tax Day.
[01:42:09.011 --> 01:42:10.311]  That's not how I knew.
[01:42:10.311 --> 01:42:11.171]  Sure, that added to it.
[01:42:12.372 --> 01:42:21.974]  The White House operatives that run CNN and MSNBC have been licking their lips for the last month saying an attack is imminent and that we're horrible murderers and soon everyone will see.
[01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:25.191]  I mean, they are operating like you're so stupid.
[01:42:25.191 --> 01:42:33.854]  I mean, when Robert Shapiro two years ago wrote for the Financial Times of London, we need a new Oklahoma City to be blamed on our political opposition so Obama can be popular.
[01:42:33.854 --> 01:42:37.135]  I'm like, uh, folks, they think you're stupid.
[01:42:37.135 --> 01:42:41.817]  They're having, like, consulary mafia meetings in the newspaper.
[01:42:41.817 --> 01:42:42.737]  They think you're so dumb.
[01:42:42.737 --> 01:42:48.799]  I mean, one Bible page separation from saying they did it or need to do it.
[01:42:51.877 --> 01:43:04.866]  I mean that's like Gary Hart on the CFR Commission wrote public letters and a paper saying we need to stage terror attacks just like PNAC did the September 20th rebuilding America's defenses thing and then one time we are changed it's in my film Truth Rising
[01:43:05.865 --> 01:43:07.506]  Found him at an event.
[01:43:07.506 --> 01:43:14.488]  He was at a book signing and came up and said, you wrote those letters and put up that public report, you know, saying we staged terror attacks in America and that we should do it again.
[01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:15.588]  He goes, no, I didn't.
[01:43:15.588 --> 01:43:16.509]  What are you talking about, son?
[01:43:16.509 --> 01:43:17.729]  They go, well, here's your letter.
[01:43:17.729 --> 01:43:22.931]  And when he read it, he started sweating and going, oh, well, I, I, that was a mock letter.
[01:43:22.931 --> 01:43:25.812]  I, I, see, they don't even think of us as human.
[01:43:25.812 --> 01:43:28.973]  You publish this stuff in the CFR.
[01:43:28.973 --> 01:43:32.894]  You publish this stuff publicly and we're not supposed to go with a copy of it?
[01:43:34.019 --> 01:43:37.222]  Like you think we're animals like all these other people?
[01:43:37.222 --> 01:43:38.263]  You think I don't see?
[01:43:38.263 --> 01:43:44.190]  You don't think I don't know you want to raise my property taxes and cut the Second Amendment and take my kids from me?
[01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:46.893]  And you say the state runs my kids on MSNBC?
[01:43:46.893 --> 01:43:49.255]  You don't think we're not gonna fight you?
[01:43:49.255 --> 01:43:52.338]  You don't think we don't know you're gonna blow stuff up and try to blame us?
[01:43:52.338 --> 01:43:55.442]  You don't think we're not watching now, you rat bastards?
[01:44:00.356 --> 01:44:02.537]  You don't think there's not fight left around here?
[01:44:02.537 --> 01:44:06.538]  Not all of us are in comas watching TV, buddy.
[01:44:06.538 --> 01:44:11.700]  Not all of us are busy, you know, down at the bar watching UFC, looking tough in front of our buddies.
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:13.761]  Not all of us are here to be run over.
[01:44:13.761 --> 01:44:15.102]  Not all of us are fake men.
[01:44:19.704 --> 01:44:26.826]  You know how slime... I've got countless clips of CNN, MSNBC, even yesterday going, you know it's gun owners did this.
[01:44:26.826 --> 01:44:30.127]  You know they use powder from the gun shops to do it.
[01:44:30.127 --> 01:44:31.268]  I mean, I even predicted that.
[01:44:31.268 --> 01:44:35.369]  I mean, they've got their whole script and they're told, don't worry, we're going to get them real soon.
[01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:36.489]  We'll get the gun bill passed.
[01:44:36.489 --> 01:44:37.950]  Something's about to happen.
[01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:39.990]  Just go tell people they're the ones that are going to do it.
[01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.711]  Oh, really?
[01:44:40.711 --> 01:44:41.071]  Tell me.
[01:44:41.071 --> 01:44:42.071]  Let me in on it.
[01:44:42.071 --> 01:44:44.612]  Nah, you're not high level enough, but we're going to burn these people.
[01:44:44.612 --> 01:44:45.812]  We're taking this country over.
[01:44:45.812 --> 01:44:46.592]  High five!
[01:44:46.592 --> 01:44:47.493]  Yeah!
[01:44:47.493 --> 01:44:47.993]  Yeah!
[01:44:49.241 --> 01:44:52.724]  Then we can torture all we want, and it won't be Iraqis we're torturing.
[01:44:52.724 --> 01:44:57.029]  It'll be all these patriots, hot wives, and their kids.
[01:44:57.029 --> 01:45:00.612]  They're all in there just high-fiving, you know, media matters.
[01:45:00.612 --> 01:45:03.895]  Southern Poverty Law Center, high-fiving, Americas are, yeah.
[01:45:03.895 --> 01:45:06.578]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:45:06.578 --> 01:45:08.520]  Go ahead and try to say we did it now.
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:09.421]  Go ahead.
[01:45:09.421 --> 01:45:10.402]  Go ahead and make my day.
[01:45:12.344 --> 01:45:14.585]  I probably shouldn't taunt him so much, but you know what?
[01:45:14.585 --> 01:45:15.965]  Do whatever you're gonna do to me.
[01:45:15.965 --> 01:45:20.287]  Just, if you ever do take me out, don't think I didn't know, okay?
[01:45:20.287 --> 01:45:21.427]  I'm not a coward like you.
[01:45:21.427 --> 01:45:26.209]  I mean, I see you.
[01:45:26.209 --> 01:45:28.150]  That's not any trick.
[01:45:28.150 --> 01:45:32.232]  You people are just over the top obvious.
[01:45:32.232 --> 01:45:37.494]  Captain Obvious on steroids to the power of infinity.
[01:45:37.494 --> 01:45:40.775]  To Captain Obvious in infinity and beyond!
[01:45:43.894 --> 01:45:54.438]  I mean, you people are running around in Democratic fundraising letters saying to your million-dollar donors, don't worry, there'll be a new Oklahoma City, we're gonna win our agenda, your money's well spent with us.
[01:45:54.438 --> 01:45:57.579]  Even letting their donors in, like, don't worry, we're gonna
[01:46:03.191 --> 01:46:17.779]  I mean, I have to sit here and watch these psychos on power trips reading their teleprompters on MSNBC going, you know, with all their twinkly eyes of just criminal energy, just going, and you know it's NRA that did this bombing and they're going to get these people.
[01:46:17.779 --> 01:46:23.742]  I mean, just over the top authoritarian scum!
[01:46:23.742 --> 01:46:26.644]  Let's go back to a real reporter, Dan Badani from Infowars.com.
[01:46:26.644 --> 01:46:29.065]  At the end of the press conference with the governor, at the end he says,
[01:46:29.770 --> 01:46:30.890]  You know what?
[01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:32.031]  Let's play the whole thing end to end.
[01:46:32.031 --> 01:46:32.951]  Cue it back up at the start.
[01:46:32.951 --> 01:46:36.352]  I want people to hear the press conference.
[01:46:36.352 --> 01:46:37.392]  Because again, this happened on Monday.
[01:46:37.392 --> 01:46:38.253]  It was just off the news.
[01:46:38.253 --> 01:46:39.233]  It was bad audio.
[01:46:39.233 --> 01:46:41.114]  But still freaked everybody out in the establishment.
[01:46:41.114 --> 01:46:43.514]  And false flags, you know, one of the top search terms.
[01:46:43.514 --> 01:46:45.155]  By the way, search the term false flag.
[01:46:45.155 --> 01:46:46.956]  I'll send it to number one.
[01:46:46.956 --> 01:46:47.836]  Do it right now, folks.
[01:46:47.836 --> 01:46:49.096]  I think I'm going to do it.
[01:46:49.096 --> 01:46:50.016]  Here is the press conference.
[01:46:50.016 --> 01:46:51.677]  Here it is.
[01:46:51.677 --> 01:46:54.158]  Is there any security footage of any of these explosions?
[01:46:55.351 --> 01:46:57.113]  We are looking at all of that right now.
[01:46:57.113 --> 01:46:59.415]  That's one of the investigative steps that we're taking.
[01:46:59.415 --> 01:47:00.736]  Was there any prior knowledge of?
[01:47:00.736 --> 01:47:07.443]  Because according to BostonGlobe.com, they said they were doing drills this morning for the same exact thing to happen, according to BostonGlobe.com.
[01:47:07.443 --> 01:47:10.926]  Now, were you guys given any warning ahead of time of this taking place?
[01:47:11.306 --> 01:47:13.967]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence.
[01:47:13.967 --> 01:47:17.649]  We certainly increased our posture around a big event like this.
[01:47:17.649 --> 01:47:23.031]  All of those things happened in preparation for this event, but there was no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen.
[01:47:23.031 --> 01:47:26.352]  Can you talk a little bit about what type of device do you have?
[01:47:26.352 --> 01:47:32.135]  The city of Boston is open and will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual.
[01:47:32.135 --> 01:47:39.277]  There will be a heightened law enforcement presence consistent with the severity and seriousness of the ongoing investigation.
[01:47:39.277 --> 01:47:40.158]  People should expect
[01:47:40.598 --> 01:47:48.081]  Those who are writing the T, that there will be random checks of backpacks and other parcels.
[01:47:48.081 --> 01:47:52.603]  And we just ask everyone to be patient with that inconvenience for the time being.
[01:47:52.603 --> 01:47:55.024]  It is for the public's sake.
[01:47:55.024 --> 01:48:03.708]  Here in the state, at the local level, and at the federal level, we are all coming together to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this.
[01:48:04.248 --> 01:48:09.930]  The most important fact that I want to convey to everybody this evening is arguably mentioned by Governor Patrick.
[01:48:09.930 --> 01:48:12.731]  The FBI is taking the lead in this investigation.
[01:48:12.731 --> 01:48:15.212]  It is asserting federal jurisdiction.
[01:48:15.212 --> 01:48:23.615]  It will do so through the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force, members of which are comprised by all the members of the law enforcement agencies here represented at the podium.
[01:48:24.235 --> 01:48:27.417]  This will be a combined federal, state, and local effort.
[01:48:27.417 --> 01:48:29.759]  It will be an ongoing investigation.
[01:48:29.759 --> 01:48:36.984]  It is a criminal investigation that is, has the potential, is a potential terrorist investigation.
[01:48:36.984 --> 01:48:38.265]  If you take any questions.
[01:48:38.265 --> 01:48:43.649]  Sir, why were loudspeakers telling people in the audience to be calm moments before the bomb went off?
[01:48:43.649 --> 01:48:49.774]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take on civil liberties and put more homeland security sticking their hands down on the pants on the streets?
[01:48:50.074 --> 01:48:50.794]  No.
[01:48:50.794 --> 01:48:52.215]  Next question.
[01:48:52.215 --> 01:48:55.276]  I'm not going to confirm that right now.
[01:48:55.276 --> 01:48:59.858]  We'll have that information for you first thing in the morning.
[01:48:59.858 --> 01:49:04.820]  The medical people are compiling that as we speak.
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:08.302]  This is a very powerful point.
[01:49:08.302 --> 01:49:12.744]  Right now, that area that the governor outlined is our main point of focus right now.
[01:49:13.084 --> 01:49:17.608]  Again, why were people telling, our speakers telling people to be calm before the bomb went off?
[01:49:17.608 --> 01:49:18.749]  I want to answer that question.
[01:49:18.749 --> 01:49:24.473]  Currently in your search for additional devices, are you searching the entire route of the marathon, or are you just focused on certain areas right now?
[01:49:24.473 --> 01:49:26.815]  Are there specific areas that you're focused on?
[01:49:26.815 --> 01:49:28.296]  Beyond the company area?
[01:49:28.296 --> 01:49:31.839]  At this point in time, our focus of the investigation is in the areas of the government.
[01:49:31.839 --> 01:49:34.381]  Why was people being told to apply to the bomb going off?
[01:49:34.381 --> 01:49:35.942]  Are there any other California people?
[01:49:35.942 --> 01:49:36.682]  If so, how would you do it?
[01:49:37.717 --> 01:49:41.001]  We're actually working very closely with the families right now.
[01:49:41.001 --> 01:49:46.747]  We're setting up a location near here that families can come to if they have any questions.
[01:49:46.747 --> 01:49:51.913]  The mayor's office has fielded many calls of concern.
[01:49:51.913 --> 01:49:53.555]  We're going through those right now.
[01:49:56.998 --> 01:50:03.285]  Why was people being told prior to the bombs going off to stay calm?
[01:50:03.285 --> 01:50:05.567]  That's a false flag, gentlemen.
[01:50:05.567 --> 01:50:07.850]  Just to put more TSA on the street.
[01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:08.971]  To rob our civil liberties.
[01:50:18.274 --> 01:50:21.156]  It is not new, and it is not order.
[01:50:21.156 --> 01:50:22.317]  It is a new world order.
[01:50:22.317 --> 01:50:23.798]  And he was talking about Hitler at that time.
[01:50:23.798 --> 01:50:25.739]  He talked about his new world order.
[01:50:25.739 --> 01:50:27.200]  That's what fascists always talk about.
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:30.802]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's what psycho guilds talk about.
[01:50:30.802 --> 01:50:33.724]  Ladies and gentlemen, they did do the drill.
[01:50:33.724 --> 01:50:35.045]  It was used as the cover.
[01:50:35.045 --> 01:50:37.666]  They were all around the guys when the bombs went off.
[01:50:37.666 --> 01:50:40.128]  There's no way they didn't stop them by accident.
[01:50:40.128 --> 01:50:42.329]  Like, we're running, stop the bomb, and it went off.
[01:50:42.329 --> 01:50:46.272]  They were all right there, in plain view, and they think you're so stupid.
[01:50:47.335 --> 01:50:49.196]  There's high-def video and photo everywhere.
[01:50:49.196 --> 01:50:53.178]  They're now admitting that we were right, that we broke it, but not giving us credit.
[01:50:53.178 --> 01:50:54.199]  And it's hidden in plain view.
[01:50:54.199 --> 01:50:59.622]  I'll give the number out, open phones in the next hour, and then the gun grabbers throwing fits that they haven't gotten our guns yet.
[01:50:59.622 --> 01:51:00.922]  But don't worry.
[01:51:00.922 --> 01:51:05.445]  They've got schizophrenics on drugs, wound up, probably putting guns in their hands right now.
[01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:10.235]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:51:10.235 --> 01:51:13.057]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:51:13.057 --> 01:51:18.640]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:22.103]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:51:22.103 --> 01:51:25.985]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:51:25.985 --> 01:51:27.366]  The fact is, you are.
[01:51:27.366 --> 01:51:28.406]  We all are.
[01:51:28.406 --> 01:51:30.728]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:51:31.008 --> 01:51:39.513]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[01:51:39.513 --> 01:51:40.894]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:44.356]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:51:44.356 --> 01:51:46.718]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:51:46.718 --> 01:51:51.240]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:57.104]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:52:01.167 --> 01:52:10.174]  It's time for a home security quiz!
[01:52:10.174 --> 01:52:23.183]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[01:52:24.224 --> 01:52:26.165]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:52:26.165 --> 01:52:28.346]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[01:52:28.346 --> 01:52:34.770]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:52:34.770 --> 01:52:42.794]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:52:43.354 --> 01:52:49.060]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:56.047]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:52:56.047 --> 01:52:56.287]  That's 877-532-5388.
[01:52:56.287 --> 01:52:57.008]  Or go to faketv.com.
[01:52:57.008 --> 01:52:59.270]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:53:08.553 --> 01:53:14.535]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[01:53:14.535 --> 01:53:16.376]  That's closer than you think.
[01:53:16.376 --> 01:53:22.558]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[01:53:22.558 --> 01:53:31.301]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[01:53:31.301 --> 01:53:36.823]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[01:53:37.583 --> 01:53:38.964]  But here's some good news.
[01:53:38.964 --> 01:53:48.452]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[01:53:48.452 --> 01:53:57.720]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:01.923]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[01:54:01.923 --> 01:54:03.425]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[01:54:13.979 --> 01:54:15.300]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:15.740]  to 2 p.m.
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:16.941]  Central, we're here live.
[01:54:16.941 --> 01:54:19.102]  It is Thursday, the 18th day of April, 2013.
[01:54:19.102 --> 01:54:23.365]  I'm going to have Jakari Jackson and David Knight on.
[01:54:23.365 --> 01:54:29.469]  They're trying to pass the CISMA bill, restrict our free speech right now, the open borders, and other things.
[01:54:29.469 --> 01:54:31.590]  We've defeated the gun grab before now.
[01:54:31.590 --> 01:54:33.371]  They're going to be here for two hours of overdrive.
[01:54:33.371 --> 01:54:39.455]  Some stations do carry that fourth hour, and then the fifth hour is video streams and audio at InfoWars.com forward slash listen.
[01:54:39.455 --> 01:54:41.016]  That's free for everybody right now.
[01:54:41.016 --> 01:54:42.697]  The bandwidth is extremely expensive.
[01:54:43.678 --> 01:54:45.840]  This is historical stuff you're seeing here.
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:49.082]  Most people are not maniac enough to go up against the New World Order.
[01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:50.443]  Most people are scared to die.
[01:54:50.443 --> 01:55:02.031]  I love life so much that I'm willing to do whatever it takes, and I don't expect that to happen, and I'll never commit suicide, but my gut tells me this is more dangerous than anything I've ever done.
[01:55:02.031 --> 01:55:04.853]  This is more dangerous than anything I've ever done.
[01:55:06.897 --> 01:55:08.559]  I had a sports car up to 175 miles an hour.
[01:55:08.559 --> 01:55:11.363]  I'm sorry, I actually didn't do that police.
[01:55:11.363 --> 01:55:12.965]  Sorry, I'm not going to tell a lie.
[01:55:12.965 --> 01:55:17.691]  The point is, is that this is the most dangerous thing I have ever done.
[01:55:17.691 --> 01:55:22.818]  And it's because this country and everything good in the world was founded on guts.
[01:55:23.939 --> 01:55:25.859]  And it was founded on telling the truth.
[01:55:25.859 --> 01:55:32.801]  And when you know evil's going on, you gotta not lie to yourself about it and rationalize and be all shaky and oh who knows.
[01:55:32.801 --> 01:55:35.662]  No, day one I said I saw the build up to this false flag.
[01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:37.842]  And this is exactly what it looks like now.
[01:55:37.842 --> 01:55:43.744]  And now Harry Reid is talking about false flags as he throws fits, saying that they've been unable to get our guns.
[01:55:43.744 --> 01:55:45.364]  Here's a clip of that.
[01:55:45.364 --> 01:55:47.265]  We can keep them off the streets.
[01:55:47.265 --> 01:55:48.505]  We should keep them off the streets.
[01:55:49.178 --> 01:55:50.478]  You got plenty of guns, don't you, bud?
[01:55:50.478 --> 01:55:54.059]  In the 1920s, organized crime was committing murders with machine guns.
[01:55:54.059 --> 01:55:54.659]  We've seen them.
[01:55:54.659 --> 01:55:57.980]  Yeah, and that was used to restrict our guns.
[01:55:57.980 --> 01:55:59.140]  Valentine's Day Massacre.
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:00.560]  They still got them.
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:04.341]  So, Congress dramatically limited the sale and transfer of machine guns.
[01:56:04.341 --> 01:56:05.041]  Yeah, full auto.
[01:56:05.041 --> 01:56:05.621]  You don't even need that.
[01:56:05.621 --> 01:56:06.741]  A long time ago.
[01:56:06.741 --> 01:56:08.902]  A bunch of bulls started to take our guns then, traitor.
[01:56:08.902 --> 01:56:13.302]  As a result, machine guns basically disappeared from the streets.
[01:56:13.302 --> 01:56:16.583]  They're in movies, but not private citizens have them.
[01:56:18.610 --> 01:56:23.551]  We can and should make the same common-sense approach... Crimes are up 49% in the last 20 years, Punk.
[01:56:23.551 --> 01:56:27.052]  Assault weapons.
[01:56:27.052 --> 01:56:29.693]  That's why I will vote for Dianne Feinstein.
[01:56:29.693 --> 01:56:32.574]  But you're a criminal who only wants the guns for yourself, Punk.
[01:56:32.574 --> 01:56:40.376]  Because we must strike a better balance between the right to defend ourselves and the right of every child in America to grow up safe from gun violence.
[01:56:40.376 --> 01:56:41.636]  Like the ones that got blown up at the...
[01:56:42.679 --> 01:56:48.762]  I'll vote for the ban because maintaining a law and order is more important than satisfying conspiracy theories.
[01:56:48.762 --> 01:56:49.942]  Ha ha ha, you scum.
[01:56:49.942 --> 01:56:50.982]  Black helicopters.
[01:56:50.982 --> 01:56:51.303]  Oh really?
[01:56:51.303 --> 01:56:52.963]  And false flags.
[01:56:52.963 --> 01:56:55.104]  Oh!
[01:56:55.104 --> 01:56:56.465]  Turn him off, that's enough of that punk.
[01:56:58.287 --> 01:56:59.789]  Listen, we're getting to them.
[01:56:59.789 --> 01:57:00.710]  They don't like it.
[01:57:00.710 --> 01:57:01.651]  Full speed ahead.
[01:57:01.651 --> 01:57:02.793]  Intensify operations.
[01:57:02.793 --> 01:57:04.434]  Just discredit them.
[01:57:04.434 --> 01:57:12.624]  Every time you email one of our stories, every time you talk about false flags, every time you expose what they've done, every time you just bring them closer to defeat.
[01:57:12.624 --> 01:57:14.466]  And they're all running scared now.
[01:57:14.466 --> 01:57:15.507]  I see them in press conferences.
[01:57:15.507 --> 01:57:15.927]  They are just...
[01:57:16.508 --> 01:57:19.651]  Freaked out because they know we're getting so close.
[01:57:19.651 --> 01:57:24.196]  They've committed this crime out in the open and they're hoping the media doesn't let it leak.
[01:57:24.196 --> 01:57:29.201]  They're hoping no one points out all the other people there and the handlers with the patsies.
[01:57:29.201 --> 01:57:30.182]  They don't know what to do.
[01:57:30.182 --> 01:57:31.223]  They had the fake arrest.
[01:57:31.223 --> 01:57:32.905]  They were going to announce it was a gun owner.
[01:57:32.905 --> 01:57:36.529]  They had everything and now it's all screwed up by the grace of God.
[01:57:38.041 --> 01:57:40.221]  You wanted to frame us, and now you can't.
[01:57:40.221 --> 01:57:44.422]  So, better carry out another false flag real quick, huh?
[01:57:44.422 --> 01:57:46.063]  You guys always do the same thing.
[01:57:46.063 --> 01:57:47.903]  So I've been thinking about what they'll do.
[01:57:47.903 --> 01:57:49.583]  They'll probably blow some more stuff up.
[01:57:49.583 --> 01:57:53.964]  And they might have set the fire at that thing up in Texas.
[01:57:53.964 --> 01:57:56.064]  That's a perfect thing to get this out of the news.
[01:57:56.064 --> 01:57:57.125]  They're in total panic mode.
[01:57:57.125 --> 01:57:59.065]  I don't know that.
[01:57:59.065 --> 01:58:00.565]  I don't have evidence of that, so we don't know.
[01:58:00.565 --> 01:58:03.886]  But they do this kind of stuff, so they are prime suspects.
[01:58:05.838 --> 01:58:23.622]  Also, go to InfowarsStore.com and buy the books, the high-quality water filters at the lowest prices with promo code WATER for all the water products, the t-shirts, the Second Amendment info, the magazines, subscribe to it, the new Come and Take It t-shirts, they've got the AR-15 M4, all of it.
[01:58:23.622 --> 01:58:27.083]  InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:27.083 --> 01:58:33.565]  We also have the Infowars Seed Center that's got a huge variety of the very best non-GMO, non-hybrid heirloom seeds at the lowest prices out there.
[01:58:35.165 --> 01:58:36.385]  The lowest prices out there.
[01:58:36.385 --> 01:58:40.286]  Hey, I told Weldon to lower the price on that particular one right there to $36.
[01:58:40.286 --> 01:58:42.267]  I want the lowest price out there.
[01:58:42.267 --> 01:58:44.047]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:58:44.047 --> 01:58:48.568]  Third hour, coming up.
[01:58:48.568 --> 01:58:52.069]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:52.069 --> 01:58:54.270]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:58.061 --> 01:59:05.284]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:59:05.284 --> 01:59:23.173]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:59:23.173 --> 01:59:27.295]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:59:27.775 --> 01:59:37.502]  The longevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:59:37.502 --> 01:59:43.806]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:59:43.806 --> 01:59:45.107]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:59:45.107 --> 01:59:45.967]  It's incredible.
[01:59:45.967 --> 01:59:55.194]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:59:55.194 --> 01:59:57.015]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:00:00.978 --> 02:00:03.381]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:03.381 --> 02:00:06.164]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.748 --> 02:00:17.571]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:17.571 --> 02:00:19.152]  You want answers?
[02:00:19.152 --> 02:00:21.073]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.073 --> 02:00:24.895]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:24.895 --> 02:00:30.879]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.879 --> 02:00:31.700]  Yeah, L.L.
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:38.624]  Lemnon, sir, in 1961 and 2, wanted to bomb Marine Corps bases, as he classified, killing Marines to blame it on Cuba.
[02:00:40.495 --> 02:00:44.278]  He thought it was best to kill Marines to take out Communism.
[02:00:44.278 --> 02:00:47.501]  But the Globalists were actually funding Communism, so they didn't let him do that.
[02:00:47.501 --> 02:00:57.790]  But you can see how a guy that even thought he was a good guy, had Thomas Jefferson quotes in his office, turned to evil, studying Operation Himmler.
[02:00:57.790 --> 02:01:02.154]  The Pentagon studied Operation Himmler, a Nazi operation of false flags that led to World War II.
[02:01:03.069 --> 02:01:04.729]  And that's why they did that.
[02:01:04.729 --> 02:01:10.251]  And so my point is, if our government would kill our own troops to get a war going, of course they'd blow that up.
[02:01:10.251 --> 02:01:11.471]  Let's put the little boy on screen.
[02:01:11.471 --> 02:01:13.631]  You know, the 8-year-old the media's been using?
[02:01:13.631 --> 02:01:15.792]  Poor little 8-year-old.
[02:01:15.792 --> 02:01:16.712]  Print me an article about him.
[02:01:16.712 --> 02:01:20.433]  I want to talk about him after we take calls coming up.
[02:01:20.433 --> 02:01:21.493]  You know, they're using him.
[02:01:21.493 --> 02:01:27.455]  I mean, imagine he died in the Boston Marathon and they'll put out fake conspiracies saying nobody died to discredit us all.
[02:01:27.455 --> 02:01:28.635]  That's a Cass Sunstein option.
[02:01:29.771 --> 02:01:35.153]  Uh, but then there's also some mentally ill people out there that, you know, think nothing's real because they've lost confidence in the government.
[02:01:35.153 --> 02:01:39.054]  See, a lot of idiots now know the government's lying, so they don't believe anything.
[02:01:39.054 --> 02:01:43.535]  And just because the government's lying all the time and doing stuff doesn't mean that everything is a lie.
[02:01:43.535 --> 02:01:45.515]  Or doesn't mean that, you know, nothing happened to Sandy Hook.
[02:01:45.515 --> 02:01:46.156]  No, no, no, no.
[02:01:46.156 --> 02:01:50.077]  If they ever got a chance to kill some real kids, they're going to.
[02:01:50.077 --> 02:01:51.137]  Because they enjoy their work.
[02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:57.233]  Because after you've killed adults and stuff, I mean, the only thing that really makes you feel dark and powerful is to kill little kids.
[02:01:57.233 --> 02:02:02.117]  I mean, I've studied history, I've studied criminology, and our hearts go out to that little boy's parents.
[02:02:02.117 --> 02:02:10.343]  But, and pray for him, you know, he's with his Heavenly Father right now in a better place, and when we all die, we'll join him in Valhalla.
[02:02:10.343 --> 02:02:17.248]  But, I don't think we've reached that stage in our lives yet, have we?
[02:02:17.248 --> 02:02:19.050]  I have extreme empathy for people.
[02:02:19.912 --> 02:02:26.317]  I don't have a transitory fake emotional thing where I only have empathy when the government and the media tells me it's okay.
[02:02:26.317 --> 02:02:27.437]  Iraqis kill them all!
[02:02:27.437 --> 02:02:30.860]  Glass parking lot, they're not human!
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:33.582]  But then you see somebody they tell you to care about, you're like, it's terrible!
[02:02:33.582 --> 02:02:37.285]  And then they were going to say, the Tea Party blew him up.
[02:02:37.285 --> 02:02:40.827]  Can you believe those dirty gun owners?
[02:02:40.827 --> 02:02:49.053]  MSNBC was going to come on and real sad and go, the little boy, killed by the gun owners, killed by the dirty Tea Party people.
[02:02:50.345 --> 02:02:51.185]  We're going to go to commercial.
[02:02:51.185 --> 02:02:53.726]  The President's coming back to this press conference right now.
[02:02:53.726 --> 02:02:55.707]  Is there nothing the Tea Party won't do?
[02:02:55.707 --> 02:02:58.068]  They're so evil.
[02:02:58.068 --> 02:02:59.188]  We better take their guns.
[02:02:59.188 --> 02:03:08.051]  When I come back I'm going to give the number out and take your phone calls on this situation.
[02:03:08.051 --> 02:03:10.272]  Do you agree with me this is the biggest thing ever?
[02:03:10.272 --> 02:03:12.533]  What is your take on this?
[02:03:12.533 --> 02:03:16.174]  That they think you're so stupid that they would have
[02:03:17.248 --> 02:03:26.394]  Army, Navy SEALs, Special Ops people everywhere with giant black bags hiding in doorways, standing around Saudi, standing around rednecks they were going to set up.
[02:03:26.394 --> 02:03:30.196]  It does look like the redneck's bag that matches, that's why he fits into so many points.
[02:03:30.196 --> 02:03:39.562]  And then we break it, it's confirmed, they're in total damage control, only showing the Saudis in free-fall craziness with emergency meetings at the White House with the Saudi foreign minister.
[02:03:39.562 --> 02:03:41.103]  I mean, this is cuckoo land.
[02:03:43.318 --> 02:03:50.323]  This is totally insane and I cannot believe that there's not more people in the media that will cover this and talk about it.
[02:03:50.323 --> 02:03:58.748]  That it's in full wars.com and my crew and drugreport.com that linked to it yesterday night and this morning.
[02:03:58.748 --> 02:04:07.334]  I mean it's just it's it is so incredible but again they just hope it just kind of sits there and the media
[02:04:09.073 --> 02:04:10.854]  They're all guaranteed in newsrooms everywhere.
[02:04:10.854 --> 02:04:16.018]  They want to run with the photos of the Navy SEALs and the Army and the Redneck.
[02:04:16.018 --> 02:04:20.162]  And you know MSNBC and CNN had it all loaded days ago.
[02:04:20.162 --> 02:04:20.942]  The photos were known.
[02:04:20.942 --> 02:04:22.043]  They had to build it up.
[02:04:22.043 --> 02:04:22.483]  Who done it?
[02:04:22.483 --> 02:04:23.704]  And they were already ready.
[02:04:23.704 --> 02:04:25.806]  That's why they were like saying, yeah, it's a lone wolf.
[02:04:25.806 --> 02:04:27.347]  It's not Saudi Arabia.
[02:04:27.347 --> 02:04:29.589]  That's what we're getting from the Justice Department, Axelrod says.
[02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:31.130]  But we're not going to tell you yet.
[02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:33.252]  We want to make sure they're like, we got these people.
[02:04:33.992 --> 02:04:35.413]  Come on, can't we break it?
[02:04:35.413 --> 02:04:37.375]  Can't we release the redneck Patsy first?
[02:04:37.375 --> 02:04:40.177]  No, no, they've got him on ice.
[02:04:40.177 --> 02:04:41.037]  Just get ready.
[02:04:41.037 --> 02:04:44.139]  Gotta build this up before we destroy the tea party.
[02:04:44.139 --> 02:04:45.420]  Alright.
[02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:48.442]  But you waited too long, didn't you?
[02:04:48.442 --> 02:04:50.744]  That's a lesson for you.
[02:04:50.744 --> 02:04:53.786]  You waited too long.
[02:04:53.786 --> 02:05:02.773]  Because we had you off balance, exposing false flag, and taking over the press conference, that you were looking at things, and while you waited, we hurt you bad.
[02:05:04.062 --> 02:05:05.330]  But they're not destroyed yet.
[02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:06.236]  They're still dangerous.
[02:05:08.041 --> 02:05:09.942]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:05:09.942 --> 02:05:13.584]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:05:13.584 --> 02:05:18.107]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:05:18.107 --> 02:05:24.231]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:05:24.231 --> 02:05:35.017]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:05:35.217 --> 02:05:38.080]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:41.723]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:05:41.723 --> 02:05:56.436]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:06:00.459 --> 02:06:11.047]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:06:11.047 --> 02:06:16.071]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:06:16.071 --> 02:06:23.236]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:06:23.376 --> 02:06:29.002]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:06:29.002 --> 02:06:33.026]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:06:33.026 --> 02:06:37.751]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:06:37.751 --> 02:06:42.977]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:06:43.217 --> 02:06:46.460]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:48.962]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:06:48.962 --> 02:06:53.726]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:06:53.726 --> 02:06:56.609]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.

[02:07:05.097 --> 02:07:05.757]  Are you?
[02:07:05.757 --> 02:07:06.858]  Infowarshop.com

[02:08:23.737 --> 02:08:25.859]  Hey, you're all pretty freaked out right now.
[02:08:25.859 --> 02:08:29.942]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:29.942 --> 02:08:32.724]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:32.724 --> 02:08:36.867]  Oh yeah.
[02:08:36.867 --> 02:08:44.233]  Oh yeah, these words like violence break the silence at MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, everywhere.
[02:08:44.233 --> 02:08:47.936]  They're being told since yesterday, don't show the photos.
[02:08:47.936 --> 02:08:50.718]  Don't show the photos that Alex Jones broke at Infowars.com.
[02:08:52.319 --> 02:08:58.042]  That show the Saudi Arabians with what looks like bombs strapped to them, right there where the bombs went off.
[02:08:58.042 --> 02:09:02.504]  Don't show the redneck patsies they had set up with cop handlers right next to them.
[02:09:02.504 --> 02:09:07.486]  Don't show all the Navy SEALs with black backpacks and special forces everywhere.
[02:09:07.486 --> 02:09:09.627]  Don't show it!
[02:09:09.627 --> 02:09:18.091]  And then you watch this morning as the Justice Department came out and released the very photo, but not all the others as we predicted they would do.
[02:09:18.091 --> 02:09:20.732]  And they said they had who did it in custody and we're going to release it.
[02:09:22.008 --> 02:09:27.270]  But then panicked and pulled back, because then everyone's going to see all the other John Doe's.
[02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:28.351]  All the other Patsy's.
[02:09:28.351 --> 02:09:30.411]  They always do that to confuse everything.
[02:09:30.411 --> 02:09:47.578]  At the Kennedy assassination, they had Italian hitmen, special forces hitmen, they had French hitmen, they had all these people there, and different brigades, and CIA, and they had a whole army brigade standing by for riot control the day before in Dallas.
[02:09:47.578 --> 02:09:48.659]  All of this going on.
[02:09:50.114 --> 02:09:54.859]  So that it's just such a confusing thing, because the public thinks of it as one guy coming after you.
[02:09:54.859 --> 02:10:03.547]  And then they said two days ago, they said Tuesday night, they said, we now know it's a lone person, not the Saudis, not a Middle Eastern.
[02:10:03.547 --> 02:10:04.908]  Axelrod says so.
[02:10:04.908 --> 02:10:06.890]  And then by yesterday morning, it was...
[02:10:07.310 --> 02:10:09.451]  Yes, yes, it looks like it's going to be tea party.
[02:10:09.451 --> 02:10:10.311]  It's going to be a right winger.
[02:10:10.311 --> 02:10:11.631]  We're not allowed to say more now.
[02:10:11.631 --> 02:10:14.832]  But sources, something's moving quickly.
[02:10:14.832 --> 02:10:15.752]  We're going to find out now.
[02:10:15.752 --> 02:10:17.033]  We're going to be able to tell you who did it.
[02:10:17.033 --> 02:10:19.573]  We're going to be able to break all this down now.
[02:10:19.573 --> 02:10:22.474]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the white male.
[02:10:22.474 --> 02:10:23.334]  It's the lone person.
[02:10:23.334 --> 02:10:24.155]  There weren't two people.
[02:10:24.155 --> 02:10:26.255]  There's only one.
[02:10:26.255 --> 02:10:32.957]  And now we see all these people with backpacks, black backpacks, looking suspicious.
[02:10:32.957 --> 02:10:34.717]  And the whole thing is blown wide open.
[02:10:34.717 --> 02:10:36.178]  And now we have the Navy SEALs.
[02:10:38.217 --> 02:10:42.981]  With the Navy SEAL caps, walking around directing the police on video.
[02:10:42.981 --> 02:10:47.646]  Guys, will you show the footage of the Navy SEAL with the radiation detector?
[02:10:47.646 --> 02:10:49.787]  Right after the bombs go off.
[02:10:49.787 --> 02:10:51.189]  Right there, in command.
[02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:56.393]  And the other guys are standing around in the street with their big ol' black backpacks.
[02:10:56.393 --> 02:11:02.099]  And they were standing right there at the end, right there with the guys that blow everything up.
[02:11:02.099 --> 02:11:02.559]  Reportedly.
[02:11:05.615 --> 02:11:09.319]  And oh, no, we shouldn't put all these people on the news and ask, who are they?
[02:11:09.319 --> 02:11:10.680]  Because there was no drill!
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:18.508]  Even though people said, yeah, people were kind of freaking out over all the, you know, backpacks and dogs, and there was announcements of, don't be worried, this is just a drill.
[02:11:18.508 --> 02:11:19.909]  Oh, it was a drill all right, wasn't it?
[02:11:28.407 --> 02:11:31.268]  We even know the type of radiation detector that is.
[02:11:31.268 --> 02:11:33.349]  Oh yeah, look, look, look, more photos.
[02:11:33.349 --> 02:11:36.290]  There's the very guys running around.
[02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:38.891]  There's more of the Navy SEALs.
[02:11:38.891 --> 02:11:41.132]  Because that was the unofficial uniform.
[02:11:41.132 --> 02:11:46.954]  The brown combat boots, tan combat boots, tan pants and black shirts.
[02:11:46.954 --> 02:11:48.395]  That was so they could identify each other.
[02:11:50.029 --> 02:11:53.731]  And they're running around with the Inspector Radiation Alert Detector.
[02:11:53.731 --> 02:11:58.274]  So they're there for a bombing drill right where the real bombers just so happen to show up.
[02:11:58.274 --> 02:12:00.175]  It's almost like, well, they were there obviously stopping.
[02:12:00.175 --> 02:12:06.159]  And no, they were sent there to do a drill in case the operatives with the real bombs got caught, they could say they were part of the drill.
[02:12:06.159 --> 02:12:13.264]  I've been explaining that to you since Monday.
[02:12:13.264 --> 02:12:14.324]  And look, another seal.
[02:12:15.359 --> 02:12:17.361]  And that is, that's the craft.
[02:12:17.361 --> 02:12:21.124]  And what they do is they create organizations like Kraft that are really still under national security.
[02:12:21.124 --> 02:12:22.485]  They even have more.
[02:12:22.485 --> 02:12:25.467]  Oh look, look at all the guys with Kraft insignia.
[02:12:25.467 --> 02:12:27.849]  Dozens and dozens and dozens.
[02:12:27.849 --> 02:12:29.710]  All these photos coming out.
[02:12:29.710 --> 02:12:30.551]  Call Paul Watson.
[02:12:30.551 --> 02:12:32.653]  I know Natural News has found more and posted.
[02:12:32.653 --> 02:12:34.835]  Have Watson double doppelganger.
[02:12:34.835 --> 02:12:36.536]  All this up to Infowars.com.
[02:12:36.536 --> 02:12:38.618]  I know we have most of these, but these are some new ones.
[02:12:39.966 --> 02:12:44.270]  In fact, tell Adon and them to just copy that whole article over to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:55.200]  I mean, and look, there's Chris Cole wearing the exact same outfit, black hat, Punisher, Navy SEAL logo with the red SEAL on the head, and then the tan pants and the tan boots.
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:57.041]  That is the uniform.
[02:12:57.041 --> 02:13:00.925]  And SEAL Team 6, SEAL Team 3, all of them have different versions of that.
[02:13:00.925 --> 02:13:06.410]  And they are crawling all over the event, right next to the guys that detonate.
[02:13:09.226 --> 02:13:10.767]  And there's Kraft International Expo.
[02:13:10.767 --> 02:13:13.209]  They're all in uniform.
[02:13:13.209 --> 02:13:14.770]  That's how they dress.
[02:13:14.770 --> 02:13:15.470]  That's what they do.
[02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:19.353]  Also, Blackwater does that, but they tend to wear black bottoms and black tops.
[02:13:21.394 --> 02:13:28.518]  They all want to be, they all like uniforms, so that's their uniform, so they can all recognize each other, and the public doesn't even know what they're looking at.
[02:13:28.518 --> 02:13:34.101]  And by the way, we also found some photos of bear claws, people with Blackwater insignias running around everywhere.
[02:13:34.101 --> 02:13:45.447]  I mean, you have like a, a, a mercenary convention down at the end of this thing, and we go, here's the Saudis, here's the rednecks, here's the handlers right next to them.
[02:13:46.701 --> 02:13:50.363]  I said they'll probably know when we expose this, go with the Saudis if they're smart.
[02:13:50.363 --> 02:13:53.545]  No one's going to buy the tea party now because that'll really create scrutiny.
[02:13:53.545 --> 02:13:56.187]  And then they canceled the press conference as I predicted.
[02:13:56.187 --> 02:14:01.630]  They canceled the press conference and now are saying, oh, we're still looking.
[02:14:01.630 --> 02:14:05.333]  And I don't know who they're going to say now.
[02:14:05.333 --> 02:14:09.375]  And boy, I feel sorry for the little patsies if they're even still alive.
[02:14:09.375 --> 02:14:11.337]  I mean, they may be.
[02:14:11.337 --> 02:14:13.358]  They probably have already been put into an acid bath.
[02:14:18.729 --> 02:14:20.671]  I mean, how dumb do they think we're?
[02:14:20.671 --> 02:14:23.153]  Oh, there's no drill, they told our reporter.
[02:14:23.153 --> 02:14:26.956]  And then the national media said, how dare Alex Jones, the megatroll.
[02:14:26.956 --> 02:14:29.858]  That was the, was that Yahoo News?
[02:14:29.858 --> 02:14:31.380]  How dare the megatroll.
[02:14:32.657 --> 02:14:35.698]  Sent his reporter to ask about a non-existent drill.
[02:14:35.698 --> 02:14:37.198]  The scum!
[02:14:37.198 --> 02:14:38.779]  The scum!
[02:14:38.779 --> 02:14:49.582]  And Glenn Beck spent 30 minutes yesterday, last night our crew heard it rebroadcast, about the terrible conspiracy site, we all know who it is, that says there was security people there and that there was a drill.
[02:14:49.582 --> 02:14:51.523]  God, Alex Jones is just so low.
[02:14:51.523 --> 02:14:53.984]  I mean, there's nothing he won't do.
[02:14:53.984 --> 02:14:56.265]  He's so horrible.
[02:14:56.265 --> 02:14:57.185]  He's such a bad man.
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:08.284]  By the way, here's Harry Reid saying how dare people, the black helicopter people, talk about false flags.
[02:15:08.284 --> 02:15:09.444]  They're very upset right now.
[02:15:09.444 --> 02:15:10.865]  People are talking about false flags.
[02:15:10.865 --> 02:15:14.486]  They don't want you to look up a false flag, a self-inflicted wound, an inside job.
[02:15:14.486 --> 02:15:19.449]  It's a government frame-up or a corporate frame-up to take your rights, to say you're all suspects.
[02:15:19.989 --> 02:15:22.591]  Now we're going to spy on you without warrants, which they're already doing.
[02:15:22.591 --> 02:15:33.359]  Now we're going to have checkpoints and you're going to pay our private contracting firms to have Kraft International and Blackwater and everybody else sticking their hands down your wife's pants.
[02:15:33.359 --> 02:15:36.802]  Because they're Navy SEALS!
[02:15:36.802 --> 02:15:42.106]  Oh, let's pay you $200,000 a piece to walk around acting tough everywhere.
[02:15:42.106 --> 02:15:43.987]  Oh yes.
[02:15:43.987 --> 02:15:44.508]  Oh yes.
[02:15:44.508 --> 02:15:48.591]  The whole takeover of our society, turning us into a cross of Baghdad and Israel.
[02:15:50.273 --> 02:15:51.817]  I don't want to live in the West Bank!
[02:15:51.817 --> 02:15:52.979]  I'm not a suspect!
[02:15:52.979 --> 02:15:55.144]  I didn't do jack squat!
[02:15:55.144 --> 02:15:56.286]  Our borders are wide open!
[02:15:59.062 --> 02:16:01.183]  I want to get your take on all of this.
[02:16:01.183 --> 02:16:01.823]  800-259-9231.
[02:16:01.823 --> 02:16:02.263]  800-259-9231.
[02:16:02.263 --> 02:16:03.223]  800-259-9231.
[02:16:03.223 --> 02:16:12.585]  And good job to Michael Savage covering this and saying false flag.
[02:16:12.585 --> 02:16:16.886]  And because Paul Watson heard it last night, he listens to it.
[02:16:16.886 --> 02:16:19.427]  And a bunch of other people are out there.
[02:16:19.427 --> 02:16:22.208]  And great job to Drudge Report last night carrying our story.
[02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:25.089]  Absolutely great job.
[02:16:25.089 --> 02:16:26.591]  And again, we've broken this.
[02:16:26.591 --> 02:16:28.072]  We tend to just move on to the next thing.
[02:16:28.072 --> 02:16:35.297]  I want my whole crew, just like National News is doing, go put... I want an article with all the SEAL photos in it.
[02:16:35.297 --> 02:16:39.200]  I mean, they were crawling the area.
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:42.543]  Crawling the area.
[02:16:42.543 --> 02:16:43.663]  And yesterday, I immediately saw this.
[02:16:43.663 --> 02:16:45.765]  I said, that's a SEAL outfit.
[02:16:45.765 --> 02:16:48.207]  And then sure enough, we find they've got SEAL insignias everywhere.
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:51.520]  800-259-9231.
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:55.562]  And again, the media, I know how they act.
[02:16:55.562 --> 02:16:59.344]  They'll say, in their first report, they'll go, Alex Jones, that scum said SEALS did it.
[02:16:59.344 --> 02:17:01.385]  Of course, I never said that.
[02:17:01.385 --> 02:17:03.025]  I said, they were there to just be part of the drill.
[02:17:03.025 --> 02:17:07.847]  It's a smoke screen where everybody, I mean, now it looks like they had 100 people there.
[02:17:07.847 --> 02:17:08.788]  No other bags were allowed.
[02:17:08.788 --> 02:17:11.109]  The cops would harass you, make you put it in your car.
[02:17:11.109 --> 02:17:14.090]  But if you were authorized, everybody bring your black bag.
[02:17:14.090 --> 02:17:16.031]  So there's no way to ever find the black bag.
[02:17:16.031 --> 02:17:17.432]  So there's so many, it's just, well,
[02:17:18.223 --> 02:17:18.903]  You're authorized.
[02:17:18.903 --> 02:17:20.124]  That's kind of your undercover thing.
[02:17:20.124 --> 02:17:22.965]  Have a big black backpack and you're allowed to be here.
[02:17:22.965 --> 02:17:25.386]  So that somebody can be like, oh, I've got my credentials.
[02:17:25.386 --> 02:17:27.247]  Let me just leave this right here next to Hillbilly.
[02:17:27.247 --> 02:17:28.968]  Hillbilly, you've done well for America.
[02:17:28.968 --> 02:17:29.428]  I'll be back.
[02:17:29.428 --> 02:17:30.148]  I'm going to get a drink.
[02:17:30.148 --> 02:17:30.909]  You want one?
[02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:33.270]  Thanks for helping us out with this drill, Bob.
[02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:35.171]  You're going to be going to prison, you idiot.
[02:17:35.171 --> 02:17:40.053]  Oh, Bob, what would you like, a Sprite or a Coke, Bob?
[02:17:40.053 --> 02:17:44.935]  I'll be right back in a moment, Bob.
[02:17:44.935 --> 02:17:46.596]  Bob, why don't we sit over here by this little kid?
[02:17:47.563 --> 02:17:48.824]  Hi son, how you doing?
[02:17:48.824 --> 02:17:49.945]  Okay.
[02:17:49.945 --> 02:17:52.867]  Get ready.
[02:17:52.867 --> 02:17:53.327]  Two minutes.
[02:17:53.327 --> 02:17:54.749]  Alright, I'll be back.
[02:17:54.749 --> 02:17:56.490]  Get that drink.
[02:17:56.490 --> 02:17:57.571]  You gotta watch the videos.
[02:17:57.571 --> 02:17:58.251]  He's walking off.
[02:17:58.251 --> 02:17:59.552]  We see it.
[02:17:59.552 --> 02:18:00.593]  Guys in the outfits.
[02:18:00.593 --> 02:18:01.594]  Okay, Bobby.
[02:18:01.594 --> 02:18:06.558]  Have a good time.
[02:18:06.558 --> 02:18:10.301]  We gotta look at the Saudi who was injured and then they released.
[02:18:10.301 --> 02:18:12.162]  We gotta look at it all.
[02:18:12.162 --> 02:18:14.404]  But see, most of these people will be killed very, very quickly now.
[02:18:15.293 --> 02:18:16.534]  And this is like the JFK deal.
[02:18:16.534 --> 02:18:17.275]  It's this big.
[02:18:17.275 --> 02:18:19.918]  I predict they're going to kill a bunch of the SEALs that were there.
[02:18:19.918 --> 02:18:21.239]  I predict you're going to be down in car wrecks.
[02:18:21.239 --> 02:18:22.160]  You're going to be down in heart attacks.
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.702]  You'll get shot at shooting ranges.
[02:18:23.702 --> 02:18:25.463]  You're all dead.
[02:18:25.463 --> 02:18:28.647]  So the only chance you've got is to go public right now with what you know.
[02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:30.469]  Oh, I know, I know.
[02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:37.810]  You're still hearing this going, well, it was a drill, and it did look like a setup, and they'll come in and brief you, and now that guy's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:18:37.810 --> 02:18:42.311]  It does look like there was something going on, and they, Al-Qaeda may have infiltrated.
[02:18:42.311 --> 02:18:45.412]  This is what they'll tell you, because I've done it before.
[02:18:45.412 --> 02:18:49.973]  The head of the FBI was telling his underlings at 9-11, oh, well, it looks like Al-Qaeda's penetrated us.
[02:18:49.973 --> 02:18:50.913]  That's how all this happened.
[02:18:50.913 --> 02:18:54.093]  Yeah, that's how we had prior knowledge and stuff and stood down.
[02:18:54.093 --> 02:18:55.173]  They've infiltrated.
[02:18:55.173 --> 02:18:57.494]  And they'll tell the SEAL guys, they'll tell you, men,
[02:18:58.652 --> 02:19:02.973]  We've been infiltrated and they used our drill as a cover for their operation.
[02:19:02.973 --> 02:19:03.653]  National Security.
[02:19:03.653 --> 02:19:05.354]  Now, don't talk about it.
[02:19:05.354 --> 02:19:07.154]  We're going to send you on a trip next week.
[02:19:07.154 --> 02:19:09.435]  We'll put a bunch of you on a helicopter.
[02:19:09.435 --> 02:19:15.056]  So, have fun getting on that helicopter.
[02:19:15.056 --> 02:19:18.397]  Hey, you signed on to be secret agent man.
[02:19:18.397 --> 02:19:20.898]  Secret agent man.
[02:19:20.898 --> 02:19:22.578]  And you better get right with Jesus right now, too.
[02:19:24.994 --> 02:19:29.998]  You're gonna be in a pine box on a slow train for Georgia.
[02:19:29.998 --> 02:19:32.220]  But don't worry, there'll be funerals for you.
[02:19:32.220 --> 02:19:35.022]  Governors will come out.
[02:19:35.022 --> 02:19:39.645]  And they'll salute the brave... Just like SEAL Team 6, you're dead.
[02:19:39.645 --> 02:19:41.767]  They'll be killing you now.
[02:19:41.767 --> 02:19:45.090]  Hey, you signed on to be tough guys!
[02:19:45.090 --> 02:19:47.371]  Signed on!
[02:19:47.371 --> 02:19:50.133]  Think about that little 8-year-old kid who's dead.
[02:19:50.133 --> 02:19:51.675]  Martin Richard.
[02:19:51.675 --> 02:19:53.076]  Shattered, blown up by a bomb.
[02:19:55.506 --> 02:19:59.010]  Collateral damage according to the New World Order to get our guns and blame the Tea Party.
[02:19:59.010 --> 02:19:59.831]  800-259-9031.
[02:19:59.831 --> 02:20:06.398]  Your phone calls coming up and the gun grabber clips straight ahead.
[02:20:06.398 --> 02:20:06.799]  Stay with us.
[02:20:08.922 --> 02:20:09.923]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:20:09.923 --> 02:20:15.450]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:20:15.450 --> 02:20:16.010]  I get it.
[02:20:16.010 --> 02:20:25.601]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:20:25.601 --> 02:20:26.743]  That's not what's happening.
[02:20:26.983 --> 02:20:35.431]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:20:35.431 --> 02:20:38.834]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:20:38.834 --> 02:20:43.078]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:20:43.078 --> 02:20:44.679]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:20:44.679 --> 02:20:48.623]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:20:48.623 --> 02:20:52.206]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:20:52.406 --> 02:20:53.307]  You should too.
[02:20:53.307 --> 02:20:54.449]  Find out what they know.
[02:20:54.449 --> 02:20:57.753]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:20:57.753 --> 02:20:57.813]  800-686-2237.
[02:20:57.813 --> 02:20:58.133]  800-686-2237.
[02:20:58.133 --> 02:20:58.334]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:07.864 --> 02:21:10.765]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[02:21:10.765 --> 02:21:16.608]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body?
[02:21:16.608 --> 02:21:20.609]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:21:20.609 --> 02:21:24.671]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:21:24.671 --> 02:21:28.813]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function.
[02:21:29.133 --> 02:21:33.175]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione.
[02:21:33.175 --> 02:21:42.321]  The number one superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells of your body to produce glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:21:42.321 --> 02:21:54.908]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful, in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:21:54.908 --> 02:21:56.409]  It is One World Whey.
[02:21:56.869 --> 02:21:58.850]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:21:58.850 --> 02:22:01.792]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:22:01.792 --> 02:22:04.853]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:22:04.853 --> 02:22:07.875]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:22:07.875 --> 02:22:09.816]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:22:09.816 --> 02:22:11.597]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:22:11.957 --> 02:22:17.620]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:21.642]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:22:21.642 --> 02:22:25.544]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:22:25.544 --> 02:22:26.925]  The fact is, you are.
[02:22:26.925 --> 02:22:27.946]  We all are.
[02:22:27.946 --> 02:22:30.267]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:22:30.567 --> 02:22:39.069]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:22:39.069 --> 02:22:40.450]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:22:40.450 --> 02:22:43.891]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:22:43.891 --> 02:22:46.251]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:22:46.251 --> 02:22:50.792]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[02:22:50.792 --> 02:22:56.654]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:22:56.914 --> 02:22:58.557]  And check out their spring specials.
[02:22:58.557 --> 02:23:00.420]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633.
[02:23:00.420 --> 02:23:05.047]  Or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:23:05.047 --> 02:23:06.910]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:23:07.622 --> 02:23:09.183]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:23:09.183 --> 02:23:15.289]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[02:23:15.289 --> 02:23:23.477]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[02:23:23.477 --> 02:23:29.142]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.
[02:23:29.142 --> 02:23:31.364]  The E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[02:23:31.644 --> 02:23:41.691]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.
[02:23:41.691 --> 02:23:46.775]  To learn more and order your Bokashi online, visit tarragonics.com and click on the orange button.

[02:23:51.978 --> 02:23:52.419]  Or call 866-369-3678.
[02:23:52.419 --> 02:23:52.659]  That's 866-369-3678.
[02:23:58.863 --> 02:24:04.525]  Recycle all your food wastes in about six weeks with the Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.com.
[02:24:04.525 --> 02:24:05.486]  Terragonics.
[02:24:05.486 --> 02:24:09.707]  Life's getting better!
[02:24:09.707 --> 02:24:11.628]  And if things don't change soon...
[02:24:27.418 --> 02:24:32.923]  First Step was touching the moon.
[02:24:32.923 --> 02:24:34.124]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[02:24:34.124 --> 02:24:34.524]  to 2 p.m.
[02:24:34.524 --> 02:24:34.905]  Central.
[02:24:34.905 --> 02:24:37.667]  Back weeknight 7 o'clock with InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:24:37.667 --> 02:24:43.973]  If you go to infowars.com forward slash listen we have the free audio and video streams of this show that will go till 5 o'clock today.
[02:24:43.973 --> 02:24:44.874]  We'll take a two-hour break.
[02:24:44.874 --> 02:24:48.837]  Be back at 7 o'clock with hours of coverage of the imploding cover-up.
[02:24:48.837 --> 02:24:50.399]  I mean this has never before happened.
[02:24:52.412 --> 02:24:56.726]  It always goes bad for them, because not everybody's in on the criminal action.
[02:24:56.726 --> 02:24:57.288]  99% aren't.
[02:24:57.288 --> 02:24:58.271]  So the cops see...
[02:24:59.858 --> 02:25:05.663]  The feds involved in Oklahoma City, people see the underwear bomber being got on the plane by the US government, on and on and on.
[02:25:05.663 --> 02:25:09.706]  They always get quasi-caught, but they just think they can call us conspiracy theorists.
[02:25:09.706 --> 02:25:17.452]  But now you've got a Navy SEAL convention with what looks like a Green Beret retiree convention.
[02:25:17.452 --> 02:25:21.095]  And by the way, you just become a Green Beret and then get recruited into black ops.
[02:25:21.095 --> 02:25:25.078]  There's like five more levels above it, at least.
[02:25:25.078 --> 02:25:26.559]  There's levels above Delta Force.
[02:25:28.817 --> 02:25:32.138]  Most accurate thing is in that movie No Way Out with Kevin Costner and he goes, who are these men?
[02:25:32.138 --> 02:25:32.818]  They're following me.
[02:25:32.818 --> 02:25:36.599]  He goes, they're men formerly associated with special forces.
[02:25:36.599 --> 02:25:41.600]  It looks like those exact guys like crouching in doorways with big black backpacks looking out like they're on.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:44.001]  I mean, just this is so bad, folks.
[02:25:44.001 --> 02:25:44.861]  This is so bad.
[02:25:44.861 --> 02:25:45.482]  All right.
[02:25:45.482 --> 02:25:46.742]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[02:25:48.035 --> 02:25:54.098]  We'll get into all the other news in the two hours after it, and the stations are more than welcome to carry the nightly news.
[02:25:54.098 --> 02:26:02.083]  We have some radio stations now actually carrying the nightly news and putting in their own ads, so cable systems are picking it up and just downloading it after it airs and putting it in themselves.
[02:26:02.083 --> 02:26:03.743]  Soon we'll be launching on satellite.
[02:26:03.743 --> 02:26:09.387]  I'm always just so busy fighting the New World Order, we don't get the rest of it done, but we're getting close.
[02:26:09.387 --> 02:26:11.348]  And thanks for all your support, we couldn't do it without you.
[02:26:11.348 --> 02:26:15.650]  I want to go to your phone calls, this is a short segment, got a bunch of gun grabber clips coming up.
[02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:16.530]  If you just join me,
[02:26:18.174 --> 02:26:20.137]  They were gonna roll out who did it.
[02:26:20.137 --> 02:26:21.498]  We have the suspect arrested.
[02:26:21.498 --> 02:26:23.000]  We're gonna roll out who we think did it.
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:23.781]  Dun, dun, dun!
[02:26:23.781 --> 02:26:25.563]  And I went, dun, dun, dun!
[02:26:25.563 --> 02:26:27.686]  Got the photos, all your people with them.
[02:26:27.686 --> 02:26:28.587]  Don't try it.
[02:26:28.587 --> 02:26:29.689]  Oh, we actually don't, huh?
[02:26:30.592 --> 02:26:33.654]  With all their guys jumping the gun going, it's Lone Wolf Tea Party.
[02:26:33.654 --> 02:26:36.576]  Remember yesterday morning and afternoon before this happened?
[02:26:36.576 --> 02:26:38.618]  They're like, it's Lone Wolf.
[02:26:38.618 --> 02:26:41.960]  We told you it's White Tea Party.
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:45.162]  They don't want us to say it, but we were right.
[02:26:45.162 --> 02:26:46.383]  It's you evil gun owners.
[02:26:46.383 --> 02:26:49.425]  Sorry you don't get to do that now, do you?
[02:26:49.425 --> 02:26:50.806]  Or you may go ahead with it.
[02:26:50.806 --> 02:26:53.808]  You may double down and just come out with it and so what?
[02:26:53.808 --> 02:26:55.950]  You got everybody around them with the other bombs and
[02:26:56.610 --> 02:26:58.171]  You know, and then unexploded devices.
[02:26:58.171 --> 02:27:05.714]  Looks like you guys had a bunch of bombs planned to go off, but things didn't work out the way you wanted at your Navy SEAL convention.
[02:27:05.714 --> 02:27:09.116]  And again, the Navy SEALs are just there for cover in the whole confusion.
[02:27:09.116 --> 02:27:14.178]  And all the Boston cops know it, like, wow, wow, mom, those are Navy SEALs.
[02:27:14.178 --> 02:27:16.159]  They can defeat King Kong.
[02:27:16.159 --> 02:27:21.301]  And sure, Navy SEALs are tough guys, strong, smart, generally, but they're still just men, folks.
[02:27:21.301 --> 02:27:23.002]  They kind of build this whole thing up.
[02:27:23.953 --> 02:27:26.734]  You know about these are the most incredible people on earth.
[02:27:26.734 --> 02:27:26.994]  Really?
[02:27:26.994 --> 02:27:29.294]  Are they incredible enough to now go public?
[02:27:29.294 --> 02:27:32.655]  That there was a drill and they were there and probably saved their lives?
[02:27:32.655 --> 02:27:35.316]  Do they have the moral courage that Pat Tillman had?
[02:27:35.316 --> 02:27:37.956]  To write letters home going, we grow the drugs here.
[02:27:37.956 --> 02:27:38.937]  There's no real war.
[02:27:38.937 --> 02:27:39.977]  This is all a hoax.
[02:27:39.977 --> 02:27:41.557]  The government runs the Taliban.
[02:27:41.557 --> 02:27:42.897]  You're dead, Pat Tillman.
[02:27:42.897 --> 02:27:45.898]  Boom!
[02:27:45.898 --> 02:27:50.499]  You got the courage of Pat Tillman, who I admire, because he had real moral courage?
[02:27:50.499 --> 02:27:53.460]  Or are you going to just play along whatever narrative they feed you, Navy SEALs?
[02:27:55.857 --> 02:27:56.757]  And I'm serious.
[02:27:56.757 --> 02:27:58.098]  A lot of you are going to have accidents.
[02:27:58.098 --> 02:27:59.198]  I know how the globalists operate.
[02:27:59.198 --> 02:28:00.599]  They will.
[02:28:00.599 --> 02:28:03.860]  I would say most of the team involved in this, you're dead.
[02:28:03.860 --> 02:28:14.385]  Just like I told Private Lynch, I said they've already killed four members of your unit that spoke out and say that you were a coward and hid and weren't involved in the fighting and then hid when Jerry Bruckheimer produced the rescue at the hospital.
[02:28:14.385 --> 02:28:19.086]  Yeah, Jerry Bruckheimer produced it over sat phone and sat video when they went in.
[02:28:19.086 --> 02:28:19.907]  That came out in the BBC.
[02:28:22.235 --> 02:28:25.798]  And I said, you better go Public Lynch or they're going to kill you.
[02:28:25.798 --> 02:28:27.940]  And go, our dead patriot, Private Lynch.
[02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:29.000]  And she came out the next day.
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.782]  I don't know if she got my message or somebody else told her and said, it's all fake.
[02:28:31.782 --> 02:28:32.763]  They told me a lie.
[02:28:32.763 --> 02:28:33.604]  I wasn't a hero.
[02:28:33.604 --> 02:28:34.585]  I apologize.
[02:28:34.585 --> 02:28:41.169]  It was the men in the resupply thing that fought off the Iraqis and then it got overrun and they took us to the hospital.
[02:28:41.169 --> 02:28:42.771]  And I hid the whole time and I'm sorry.
[02:28:43.513 --> 02:28:45.334]  This is propaganda to get women in the military.
[02:28:45.334 --> 02:28:53.457]  And they didn't have to kill her then, because she, she was, but see, they killed Pat Tillman and said, he died charging the machine gun nest, battling Al Qaeda.
[02:28:53.457 --> 02:28:56.399]  And then the army coroner wouldn't lie and said, no, it was homicide.
[02:28:56.399 --> 02:28:57.379]  They killed him.
[02:28:57.379 --> 02:28:59.040]  They first shot him at a distance.
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:01.721]  He begged behind the rock and said, I'm friendly, I'm friendly.
[02:29:01.721 --> 02:29:03.742]  He got back up, they shot him again.
[02:29:03.742 --> 02:29:07.284]  And then they got up there and triple tapped him at about five feet away with an M16.
[02:29:09.005 --> 02:29:11.409]  They shot him across the frontal lobe.
[02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:15.114]  Bullets going, three bullets going into the cerebral cortex.
[02:29:15.114 --> 02:29:18.779]  As he flopped around on the ground with wounds all over his body.
[02:29:18.779 --> 02:29:20.121]  Saying, I'm friendly, I'm friendly.
[02:29:20.121 --> 02:29:22.645]  Oh, they knew you were friendly, buddy.
[02:29:22.645 --> 02:29:25.209]  They knew how friendly you were to America and they murdered you.
[02:29:26.594 --> 02:29:28.295]  Oh, but I'm supposed to not talk about that.
[02:29:28.295 --> 02:29:32.317]  I'm supposed to be a big schmuck, a big chump, a big cowardly fool.
[02:29:32.317 --> 02:29:32.597]  No!
[02:29:32.597 --> 02:29:39.740]  I have sworn on the altar of God eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of men.
[02:29:39.740 --> 02:29:45.383]  And I'm going into the black hole, in, through, and beyond, ramming speed.
[02:29:45.383 --> 02:29:49.185]  I am putting the accelerator all the way down, pedal to the metal.
[02:29:49.185 --> 02:29:55.108]  I'm slamming it down, and I'm chaining myself to this craft, going straight into the enemy.
[02:29:57.540 --> 02:30:01.466]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.466 --> 02:30:04.129]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.601 --> 02:30:12.022]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:30:12.022 --> 02:30:18.064]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:30:18.064 --> 02:30:21.946]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[02:30:21.946 --> 02:30:23.526]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[02:30:23.526 --> 02:30:27.988]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[02:31:05.269 --> 02:31:07.431]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[02:31:08.311 --> 02:31:10.253]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:31:10.253 --> 02:31:12.414]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:31:12.414 --> 02:31:18.138]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:31:18.138 --> 02:31:22.181]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:31:22.181 --> 02:31:26.104]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:31:26.104 --> 02:31:27.505]  The fact is, you are.
[02:31:27.505 --> 02:31:28.525]  We all are.
[02:31:28.525 --> 02:31:30.847]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:31:31.167 --> 02:31:39.713]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:31:39.713 --> 02:31:41.114]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:31:41.114 --> 02:31:44.576]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:31:44.576 --> 02:31:46.958]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:31:46.958 --> 02:31:51.541]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best durable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[02:31:51.541 --> 02:31:57.425]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:31:58.506 --> 02:32:09.775]  I had tried everything.
[02:32:09.775 --> 02:32:12.117]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:32:12.117 --> 02:32:15.260]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:32:15.260 --> 02:32:20.104]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:32:20.104 --> 02:32:26.469]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:32:26.949 --> 02:32:38.155]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:32:38.155 --> 02:32:42.638]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:32:42.638 --> 02:32:48.881]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:32:48.881 --> 02:32:50.022]  Now that's results!
[02:32:50.442 --> 02:33:02.969]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[02:33:02.969 --> 02:33:05.510]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:06.570]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[02:33:11.008 --> 02:33:20.541]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:33:20.541 --> 02:33:22.103]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:22.103 --> 02:33:25.768]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:28.323 --> 02:33:30.945]  Join me in defeating tyranny.
[02:33:30.945 --> 02:33:32.626]  Throw fear to the wind.
[02:33:32.626 --> 02:33:42.872]  Realize the only way through this is to realize the enemy operations and to grow up and face the monsters that lurk and inhabit our government and major corporations.
[02:33:42.872 --> 02:33:49.897]  The only way to be free is to be free and stand as free men and women have done throughout history and declare your independence.
[02:33:51.212 --> 02:33:55.098]  Declare your independence at a spiritual, subatomic level.
[02:33:55.098 --> 02:34:00.205]  Declare your independence in your soul, in your will, in your intellect.
[02:34:00.205 --> 02:34:04.111]  And then that will will work its will upon the world.
[02:34:04.111 --> 02:34:06.314]  Being free is a decision.
[02:34:07.805 --> 02:34:17.189]  That's all you have to do is commit to truth and ask God to open your heart, open your mind and to use you as a vessel against evil.
[02:34:17.189 --> 02:34:33.055]  Pray that prayer and turn yourself fully over to life and the Holy Spirit and the universe will open up and the living water of Jesus Christ will flow straight out of the time-space continuum and you will truly be free.
[02:34:36.064 --> 02:34:37.927]  Alright, I want to go to your calls or I'll never get to them.
[02:34:37.927 --> 02:34:40.530]  We're doing two hours at least.
[02:34:40.530 --> 02:34:43.975]  Maybe three hours of overdrive after this show today.
[02:34:43.975 --> 02:34:47.560]  It'll be audio and video streams at InfoWars.com forward slash listen.
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:51.605]  You can also find the streams at PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:53.191 --> 02:34:54.452]  And I get wound up here.
[02:34:54.452 --> 02:34:56.994]  I mean, I get right down to the guts, right down to who I am.
[02:34:56.994 --> 02:34:57.975]  It sounds wild.
[02:34:57.975 --> 02:35:03.980]  It sounds like, you know, a movie of what, but those are based on how people really act when they've committed to something.
[02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:10.206]  When you fully know the danger and just commit to it and go through it, it's a spiritual decision.
[02:35:11.847 --> 02:35:15.328]  And I want to know the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help me God.
[02:35:15.328 --> 02:35:18.389]  And I want to be strong in the face of the tyrants.
[02:35:18.389 --> 02:35:23.130]  I want to defend little eight-year-old boys like Martin Richard, who they're using for their tyranny.
[02:35:23.130 --> 02:35:29.632]  And watching Americans be so sentimental and crying and the goodness and, hey, we're going to have courage and all this.
[02:35:29.632 --> 02:35:33.914]  But it's only so they can take our sentimentality and say, you're going to have courage with the army checking your...
[02:35:35.134 --> 02:35:37.295]  Checking your ID now when you walk down the street?
[02:35:37.295 --> 02:35:39.595]  You gonna have courage when we take your bank account without a warrant?
[02:35:39.595 --> 02:35:43.197]  You gonna have courage when we arrest gun owners for 10 round mags or up?
[02:35:43.197 --> 02:35:46.738]  You gonna have... See, it's all about... And the government's the big papa.
[02:35:46.738 --> 02:35:48.898]  Oh, you did good when the bombing happened.
[02:35:48.898 --> 02:35:51.779]  You know, the patriotism... The patriotism?
[02:35:51.779 --> 02:35:53.020]  You mean for the New World Order?
[02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:56.180]  That's not the patriotism.
[02:35:56.180 --> 02:36:01.782]  They are preying on you, and it's cynical, it's disgusting, and it's horrible to admit to yourself.
[02:36:01.782 --> 02:36:03.603]  I know it is.
[02:36:03.603 --> 02:36:03.783]  But...
[02:36:06.121 --> 02:36:08.582]  I have never had anything but success against these people.
[02:36:08.582 --> 02:36:16.743]  When I would expose $3,000, $2,000 a day fines on old people taking their houses for three-inch grass, it would stop them.
[02:36:16.743 --> 02:36:20.104]  When I would fight for people with the CPS going after their kids, we would stop them.
[02:36:20.104 --> 02:36:22.124]  But I couldn't do all the cases.
[02:36:22.124 --> 02:36:23.725]  I couldn't help.
[02:36:23.725 --> 02:36:25.305]  I'd help one and then hundreds would come.
[02:36:25.305 --> 02:36:27.205]  And I was like, other people, you need to help them.
[02:36:27.205 --> 02:36:29.606]  And then I had to triage this.
[02:36:31.727 --> 02:36:39.550]  Triage is where I had to turn it off and just go, I can't, you know, the hundreds of families a day having their kids taken, in most cases, for absolutely no reason.
[02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:43.151]  I had to just sit there and go, well, I'll work till 10 tonight.
[02:36:43.151 --> 02:36:47.713]  I'll do another video on vaccines killing people when I read about the vaccines killing people.
[02:36:47.713 --> 02:36:57.416]  I'll do another, you know, like when I'm totally tired, got a headache, exhausted, I will literally go in my office and just get down on my knees and say, God, give me energy, give me strength to fight.
[02:36:59.011 --> 02:37:02.912]  And then my subconscious, the devil, whatever you want to call it, comes and says, oh, look, you did a bad job.
[02:37:02.912 --> 02:37:04.293]  Look how obnoxious you are.
[02:37:04.293 --> 02:37:04.933]  Doesn't matter.
[02:37:04.933 --> 02:37:05.553]  My heart's right.
[02:37:05.553 --> 02:37:07.854]  I'm doing the best job I can.
[02:37:07.854 --> 02:37:17.578]  And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, if you're not on your knees at least once a day, really trying to get close to God in times like these, there's something wrong with you.
[02:37:18.817 --> 02:37:25.819]  And you can knock God all day, but notice as God has gotten out of our lives, and as Christ has gotten out of our lives, look at what America's turning into.
[02:37:25.819 --> 02:37:27.079]  Just look at it!
[02:37:27.079 --> 02:37:28.700]  Just look at it!
[02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:31.901]  And I don't point at the corrupt churches and say, oh, you want me to go to that.
[02:37:31.901 --> 02:37:33.521]  No, that's part of the problem.
[02:37:33.521 --> 02:37:36.982]  That's all Christ talked about, was corrupt churches of His day.
[02:37:36.982 --> 02:37:40.283]  And then Paul, the fake Christian churches, the Pharisees in there.
[02:37:43.046 --> 02:37:48.951]  But it's the reality that people have become willfully evil, willfully arrogant.
[02:37:48.951 --> 02:37:50.592]  They're like, I don't care what's happening.
[02:37:50.592 --> 02:37:52.194]  All I want to do is go have a good time.
[02:37:52.194 --> 02:37:56.758]  But when you're like that, having the good time isn't fun.
[02:37:56.758 --> 02:38:01.542]  So many men, choosing this as an analogy, that have never really had success with women,
[02:38:02.481 --> 02:38:08.282]  They, once they do later in life, run around crazy with all these sexual partners, all this stuff, because they were never fulfilled.
[02:38:08.282 --> 02:38:12.263]  But when it's just empty, sex stops even being good.
[02:38:12.263 --> 02:38:14.844]  If there's not that love there.
[02:38:14.844 --> 02:38:18.145]  If there's not that real connection, both people just get emptied out.
[02:38:18.145 --> 02:38:19.565]  It's not even real anymore.
[02:38:19.565 --> 02:38:22.946]  So people do wilder and wilder things trying to find
[02:38:25.793 --> 02:38:33.537]  So many decadent people just get more and more decadent and more and more empty, whereas if you love somebody, it just gets better and better.
[02:38:33.537 --> 02:38:35.779]  It's the same thing.
[02:38:35.779 --> 02:38:38.520]  Evil is not going to fulfill you.
[02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:41.782]  The people involved in this bombing, you're not fulfilled.
[02:38:41.782 --> 02:38:43.843]  Most of you are turned over to evil completely.
[02:38:43.843 --> 02:38:46.525]  You're on a power trip that you're in on the big secret.
[02:38:46.525 --> 02:38:47.946]  Let me tell you, you're not in on a lot of it.
[02:38:49.022 --> 02:38:51.283]  I'm in on all of it because I've studied history.
[02:38:51.283 --> 02:38:52.604]  I'm in on all of it.
[02:38:52.604 --> 02:38:58.588]  I can decompartmentalize their entire operation because I've studied it with a serious mind.
[02:38:58.588 --> 02:39:03.811]  And let me tell you, this thing is a man-eating bear trap you don't want to be part of.
[02:39:03.811 --> 02:39:05.272]  Let's go to these calls, I apologize.
[02:39:05.272 --> 02:39:07.373]  Let's talk to Rick in Virginia.
[02:39:07.373 --> 02:39:09.014]  You're on the air, Rick.
[02:39:09.014 --> 02:39:11.435]  What's your take on all this?
[02:39:11.435 --> 02:39:15.938]  Yeah, well, I found a news article from the New York Magazine.
[02:39:16.676 --> 02:39:17.457]  We're good to go.
[02:39:45.170 --> 02:39:59.115]  No, I've said over and over again, they'll come out with cover stories and they'll put forward a distraction away from the original redneck patsies that they were going to roll out.
[02:39:59.115 --> 02:40:00.936]  They're going to have cover stories.
[02:40:00.936 --> 02:40:03.277]  They're going to try to spin this.
[02:40:03.277 --> 02:40:09.259]  But my whole point is we put out all the suspicious groups with the backpacks and they've chosen to go with this.
[02:40:13.254 --> 02:40:14.477]  You understand?
[02:40:14.477 --> 02:40:15.319]  Send me that article!
[02:40:15.319 --> 02:40:16.902]  Send me that article!
[02:40:16.902 --> 02:40:17.905]  What's the headline on that article?
[02:40:23.482 --> 02:40:29.165]  Images of Boston suspects, not the guys on the post's front page, will be released today.
[02:40:29.165 --> 02:40:29.565]  There it is.
[02:40:29.565 --> 02:40:34.848]  Images of suspects, not the guys on the post's front page, will be released today.
[02:40:34.848 --> 02:40:37.109]  And let's scroll down to it.
[02:40:37.109 --> 02:40:38.470]  Let's scroll down to the images they're talking about.
[02:40:38.470 --> 02:40:39.210]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:40:39.210 --> 02:40:40.871]  Spin machine and high drive.
[02:40:40.871 --> 02:40:47.834]  See, why don't they release all the Navy SEAL photos, the redneck photos, the guys crouching in doorways with bags.
[02:40:47.834 --> 02:40:48.975]  They're saying there was no drill.
[02:40:49.355 --> 02:40:53.018]  When it's clear, they were having a giant drill right there.
[02:40:53.018 --> 02:40:57.202]  So we will continue to follow up with all of that.
[02:40:57.202 --> 02:41:03.828]  Yeah, now if you look at that guy with the bag, the black bag with the silver stripe, that's what matches what the FBI is saying what's left.
[02:41:03.828 --> 02:41:07.191]  And I believe that's who they claim they were going to arrest and that that's their Patsy.
[02:41:08.649 --> 02:41:28.362]  Now, who knows what they'll try now, but again, the big story here is that there's swarming drill going on with special forces, what looks like Army and Navy, everywhere, I mean, literally by the flags where this happened, and they've denied the drill when they were announcing the drill, and they've tried to grab all the victims and keep them quiet.
[02:41:28.362 --> 02:41:33.945]  So, again, we know there was a major drill going on, and we know they said that they had already arrested the guy.
[02:41:33.945 --> 02:41:37.287]  Why isn't there an investigation now that they didn't have the press conference?
[02:41:37.287 --> 02:41:37.928]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:41:39.875 --> 02:41:43.038]  Yeah.
[02:41:43.038 --> 02:41:44.940]  And again, why are they trying to divert?
[02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:49.044]  And again, there's other Saudis that they've arrested and then released or gone to their houses.
[02:41:49.044 --> 02:41:51.967]  And then you've got meeting with the Saudi ambassador out of the blue.
[02:41:51.967 --> 02:41:57.353]  And again, they do it because they know the simple minds can't understand what's going on with all this.
[02:41:58.459 --> 02:41:59.159]  No, I'm not saying...
[02:42:20.236 --> 02:42:24.597]  Yeah, I was watching a live leak from a local Boston channel reporting on what was going on at the courthouse.
[02:42:24.597 --> 02:42:26.897]  They had a helicopter footage and it literally looked like you were watching a movie.
[02:42:49.181 --> 02:42:56.527]  They had military outside the courthouse with AR-15s protecting it while they kicked everyone out of the courthouse.
[02:42:56.527 --> 02:43:01.471]  Then they showed this van with tinted windows with a military person hanging off the side.
[02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:07.937]  Go, um, zoom up the street back into the courthouse and it looked like they basically took someone out.
[02:43:08.675 --> 02:43:09.656]  Yeah, do me a favor.
[02:43:09.656 --> 02:43:11.396]  Find that video and send it.
[02:43:11.396 --> 02:43:12.957]  I actually saw some of that walking by.
[02:43:12.957 --> 02:43:14.718]  I think it was CNN during a break.
[02:43:14.718 --> 02:43:16.679]  But you get dingy when you're on the air this much.
[02:43:16.679 --> 02:43:17.820]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:22.022]  That's the courthouse where they were saying they were going to have the press conference in front of it.
[02:43:22.022 --> 02:43:23.403]  And then they said another location.
[02:43:23.403 --> 02:43:27.245]  Then they run in exactly where they wanted to get the media out to get rid.
[02:43:27.245 --> 02:43:28.585]  They said, we've arrested.
[02:43:28.585 --> 02:43:29.926]  We have the suspect.
[02:43:29.926 --> 02:43:34.468]  And then here comes the black van to get him out of there to sleep with the fishes or whatever happened to him.
[02:43:34.468 --> 02:43:35.109]  So, yes.
[02:43:35.109 --> 02:43:36.729]  What was that Boston station?
[02:43:36.729 --> 02:43:37.550]  Boston helicopter?
[02:43:38.626 --> 02:43:43.252]  It was WCVB.com, the Boston Channel.
[02:43:43.252 --> 02:43:46.136]  I sent it to Rob Dues' email.
[02:43:46.136 --> 02:43:48.500]  What time did you send that?
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:49.822]  Probably about an hour ago.
[02:43:50.673 --> 02:43:55.094]  Alright, I'll... guys, go tell Dewar, call him, because I know the building's big now.
[02:43:55.094 --> 02:43:57.575]  Just keep, like, getting them space next to us and next to us.
[02:43:57.575 --> 02:44:00.215]  We have the whole building is like an aircraft carrier.
[02:44:00.215 --> 02:44:01.915]  We got room to grow here.
[02:44:01.915 --> 02:44:03.496]  But, thank you.
[02:44:03.496 --> 02:44:05.076]  Gosh, I should be going to more of your calls.
[02:44:05.076 --> 02:44:06.296]  Absolutely.
[02:44:06.296 --> 02:44:17.059]  They act... I mean, that was a way, in my opinion, the most likely thing, that's what I do is approximations, the most likely thing is, because they said, we have him, we're gonna have a press conference, we got the guy!
[02:44:17.059 --> 02:44:17.659]  We got him!
[02:44:17.659 --> 02:44:18.179]  Yay!
[02:44:18.179 --> 02:44:18.579]  And it's like,
[02:44:19.733 --> 02:44:23.795]  Oh no, no we don't, no we don't, because they've decided to go with some other plan.
[02:44:23.795 --> 02:44:32.038]  To then take all the guys with the backpacks, pick the ones that maybe aren't involved, or are Middle Eastern, that are a rabbit trail, or maybe are, they cover it up, and then they get rid of it.
[02:44:32.038 --> 02:44:37.940]  But the media had already jumped the gun and said it's lone wolf, not foreign, it's right-wingers.
[02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:40.741]  They had already jumped the gun because they wanted to be first.
[02:44:40.741 --> 02:44:43.122]  And they've all got White House connections, MSNBC and others.
[02:44:43.122 --> 02:44:45.943]  I mean, do you see how big that is, or do you have other points you'd like to add?
[02:44:47.108 --> 02:44:48.850]  Oh no, I definitely see how big it is.
[02:44:48.850 --> 02:44:55.058]  I think they were probably going to roll out the white right-wing guy, probably the guy in the blue robe that was holding that backpack.
[02:44:55.058 --> 02:44:58.262]  But then as soon as we got all the videos and photos out, they couldn't do it.
[02:44:59.744 --> 02:45:02.546]  Yeah, so maybe they'll get some other schizophrenic or something.
[02:45:02.546 --> 02:45:06.208]  Probably electro-shocking somebody right now where they won't know where they are for a month.
[02:45:06.208 --> 02:45:09.350]  And you turn it up on high and they'll roll him out drooling.
[02:45:09.350 --> 02:45:09.871]  Who knows?
[02:45:09.871 --> 02:45:12.192]  I mean, who knows?
[02:45:12.192 --> 02:45:16.555]  Or they may be torturing the guy to get him to confess or before they roll him out.
[02:45:16.555 --> 02:45:17.256]  I have no idea.
[02:45:17.856 --> 02:45:22.839]  I mean, I just know McVeigh was assigned the second most famous mind control doctor in U.S.
[02:45:22.839 --> 02:45:29.762]  history, Jollian West, the protÃ©gÃ© of the CIA director of MKUltra, Dr. Ewan Cameron.
[02:45:29.762 --> 02:45:31.803]  And that's History Channel documentaries.
[02:45:31.803 --> 02:45:35.325]  And then they're like, oh, never mind, the top mind control doctor is McVeigh's doctor.
[02:45:35.325 --> 02:45:39.267]  And then McVeigh would get off the drugs and tell people in jail cells next to him, I'm under mind control.
[02:45:39.267 --> 02:45:40.327]  I'm Army Special Forces.
[02:45:40.327 --> 02:45:41.248]  They set me up.
[02:45:41.248 --> 02:45:43.349]  And then Nichols signed an affidavit saying that.
[02:45:44.244 --> 02:45:48.305]  Plus, that's what all the cops I talked to in Oklahoma City said.
[02:45:48.305 --> 02:45:49.746]  They was totally set up.
[02:45:49.746 --> 02:46:01.950]  And I've been telling people last week, I said Monday before this even happened, because the show, you know, led into it, I remember saying, people can look this up, I remember saying, look, if you're in the military or police, don't be part of these drills.
[02:46:01.950 --> 02:46:04.651]  Because one out of a hundred, they're going to blow you up.
[02:46:04.651 --> 02:46:06.831]  Man, you can't be any more on target than that.
[02:46:06.831 --> 02:46:08.052]  So yeah, we'll see what happens.
[02:46:08.052 --> 02:46:08.852]  And absolutely,
[02:46:09.957 --> 02:46:15.920]  That's why I said they were going to go with the rednecks, but they went with the Saudis, whether they're real or not, as a divert.
[02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:22.143]  And then they probably had other backup rednecks in the area, too, that aren't in the photo, but they're scared.
[02:46:22.143 --> 02:46:27.126]  They're going over all the photos to see if we've got photos of the rednecks next to their handlers.
[02:46:28.510 --> 02:46:30.770]  And again, I wouldn't want to be those rednecks right now.
[02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:31.351]  Poor guys.
[02:46:31.351 --> 02:46:35.091]  You know, they were like, be part of a special program to help America.
[02:46:35.091 --> 02:46:38.192]  And we want to be part of a drill, just like 7-7 with those Arabs.
[02:46:38.192 --> 02:46:39.652]  I want to help America.
[02:46:39.652 --> 02:46:40.372]  Good, Billy.
[02:46:40.372 --> 02:46:41.412]  You're going to help them now.
[02:46:41.412 --> 02:46:42.513]  Are you ready?
[02:46:42.513 --> 02:46:43.853]  I mean, it's just so sick.
[02:46:43.853 --> 02:46:44.093]  All right.
[02:46:44.093 --> 02:46:44.413]  Thank you.
[02:46:44.413 --> 02:46:45.933]  God bless you.
[02:46:45.933 --> 02:46:47.634]  Let's go to Matt in Alabama.
[02:46:47.634 --> 02:46:48.194]  You're on the air.
[02:46:48.194 --> 02:46:50.454]  How you doing today?
[02:46:50.454 --> 02:46:50.874]  Pretty good.
[02:46:50.874 --> 02:46:55.235]  I just want to say thank you so much for breaking the news yesterday.
[02:46:56.022 --> 02:47:08.007]  And I was trying to post it as quick as you were breaking it on Facebook, and they were editing it and taking it away as quick as I was... Oh yeah, Facebook is a pump and dump scam by the Bilderbergs that he officially attends and he calls us dumb effords.
[02:47:08.007 --> 02:47:11.168]  We use it just to expose him, but yeah, they censor everything.
[02:47:11.168 --> 02:47:14.670]  People try to do articles about Benghazi cover-up, they'll shut down your account.
[02:47:14.670 --> 02:47:17.351]  I mean, Facebook is a stinking joke.
[02:47:17.351 --> 02:47:18.811]  Go ahead.
[02:47:18.811 --> 02:47:24.894]  I know, and I'm part of the military, and I'm a veteran Sergeant of the Marines and also trained as a police officer, so...
[02:47:25.831 --> 02:47:34.877]  Uh, this, I mean, this thing stinks to high heaven and what we need to do is troll Facebook to see if we can find names to faces that you have posted on the pictures.
[02:47:35.595 --> 02:47:42.561]  To see if maybe we might be able to find somebody who... Yeah, yeah, that's what Jakari Jackson, we'll call it a two hour investigation.
[02:47:42.561 --> 02:47:46.404]  I'll let them cover some other news and then for like 20 minutes on SOPA and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:47:46.404 --> 02:47:54.009]  But then I want the guys to open the phones up and just take your human intelligence and tips from callers because it's been you.
[02:47:54.009 --> 02:47:56.952]  It's the listeners that are doing this and I should have been taking more calls.
[02:47:56.952 --> 02:47:59.894]  I just get so wound up and caught up in my own analysis.
[02:48:01.195 --> 02:48:06.581]  Why do you, as a Marine and a guy that trains police, what signs are you seeing?
[02:48:06.581 --> 02:48:08.363]  What do you see as the biggest smoking gun?
[02:48:08.363 --> 02:48:11.826]  All these special forces at the end of the race?
[02:48:11.826 --> 02:48:13.048]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:48:13.048 --> 02:48:17.352]  I think the focus was on the Newtown kids.
[02:48:17.352 --> 02:48:23.699]  So we need to figure out if they were parents against gun control or parents with gun control to see if
[02:48:24.246 --> 02:48:31.051]  Because I think they could have exploited that as well, that they really didn't because of the breaking news you broke.
[02:48:31.051 --> 02:48:37.275]  Oh yeah, I mean there's no doubt they're going to try to say it's probably gunpowder out of reloading so we can't have gunpowder.
[02:48:37.275 --> 02:48:41.197]  Yeah, and I just want to make one more quick statement so that you can get to other topics.
[02:48:41.197 --> 02:48:42.178]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:48:42.178 --> 02:48:46.981]  I like it when we had Cordurand from Smashing Pumpkins on there.
[02:48:46.981 --> 02:48:50.904]  Now I think to get him on there, to get him to do a piece on it,
[02:48:51.738 --> 02:48:57.788]  To expose on a different angle like he was saying during the couple weeks ago with his other interview.
[02:48:57.788 --> 02:49:02.397]  I think that would be able to bring other audience to you.
[02:49:03.573 --> 02:49:04.914]  I agree.
[02:49:04.914 --> 02:49:06.075]  Listen, I want to explain something.
[02:49:06.075 --> 02:49:07.056]  God bless you, sir.
[02:49:07.056 --> 02:49:09.098]  I'm not even trying to get an audience.
[02:49:09.098 --> 02:49:09.718]  I'll be honest.
[02:49:09.718 --> 02:49:17.806]  If we were to defeat the current globalists and turn back the tide and everything, I'd come in here three hours a day to the radio show and promote homeschooling or something.
[02:49:17.806 --> 02:49:20.048]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[02:49:20.048 --> 02:49:21.048]  I'd like nothing better.
[02:49:22.025 --> 02:49:23.747]  This new earpiece is so painful, man.
[02:49:23.747 --> 02:49:24.988]  I got a new earpiece.
[02:49:24.988 --> 02:49:28.532]  It hurts like a torture device in my ear compared to those other ones.
[02:49:28.532 --> 02:49:30.614]  Maybe put a new tip on here, the old style tip in here.
[02:49:30.614 --> 02:49:32.937]  That's why I keep pulling it in and out of my ear for TV viewers.
[02:49:38.632 --> 02:49:44.236]  I want everybody to spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com because you either become big fish or you get eaten.
[02:49:44.236 --> 02:49:46.058]  We are in incredible danger.
[02:49:46.058 --> 02:49:49.500]  I tell people that come to work here that, I mean, you're getting into the real deal.
[02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:50.821]  This is not a game.
[02:49:50.821 --> 02:49:52.262]  And I need people's prayers.
[02:49:52.262 --> 02:49:53.023]  I need your support.
[02:49:53.023 --> 02:49:54.084]  I need your financial support.
[02:49:54.084 --> 02:49:57.506]  I need you to buy the books, the seeds, the water filters, the storable food.
[02:49:57.506 --> 02:50:00.228]  For me, foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:50:00.228 --> 02:50:01.529]  I got 25% off this month, by the way.
[02:50:01.529 --> 02:50:03.351]  I need people to support all our sponsors.
[02:50:03.351 --> 02:50:03.771]  God bless you.
[02:50:03.771 --> 02:50:04.572]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:50:04.572 --> 02:50:06.013]  We're going to come back and talk to Colin.
[02:50:07.677 --> 02:50:26.561]  Joe and Jeremy and Chad and Tracy and a bunch of other people, but I mean, this is not your average little egomaniac show where the host is on the air and has butterflies and loves going to, you know, Hollywood galas and loves strutting around and things.
[02:50:26.561 --> 02:50:29.922]  I mean, I just could care less, literally, literally.
[02:50:31.181 --> 02:50:35.104]  I would be hunting, and fishing, and hiking, and oil painting, and going to art shows.
[02:50:35.104 --> 02:50:49.436]  I'm like a redneck that likes art, and literature, and poetry, and the symphony, and also country music, and heavy metal, and bluegrass, and rock and roll, and I just love my wife and my kids, and I'm just here to fight these murderers.
[02:50:49.436 --> 02:50:50.077]  I mean, I see them.
[02:50:50.077 --> 02:50:51.117]  I know who they are.
[02:50:51.117 --> 02:50:54.801]  God gave me an intellect to fight these people, and it's my job to burn them down.
[02:50:55.689 --> 02:50:56.669]  I will.
[02:50:56.669 --> 02:50:57.250]  With your help.
[02:50:57.250 --> 02:50:57.950]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:57.950 --> 02:50:59.991]  Stay with us at FullWars.com.

[02:52:33.729 --> 02:52:39.571]  Hi, I'm Dr. Joel Wallach, the Dead Doctors Don't Lie guy, and I prescribe the Healthy Body Challenge, and I'll be there.

[02:53:08.103 --> 02:53:11.144]  The coming financial collapse is real.
[02:53:11.144 --> 02:53:14.344]  The subsequent social unrest will happen.
[02:53:14.344 --> 02:53:18.805]  Even if you made it out of suburbia alive, where would you take your family?
[02:53:18.805 --> 02:53:26.767]  Act now to secure your survival retreat in the American Redoubt with the experts at survivalretreatconsulting.com.

[02:54:04.036 --> 02:54:06.017]  You win some, lose some.
[02:54:06.017 --> 02:54:08.699]  It's all a game to me.
[02:54:08.699 --> 02:54:15.522]  Seven or eleven snake eyes watching you.
[02:54:15.522 --> 02:54:16.443]  The dead man's hand again.
[02:54:29.943 --> 02:54:32.866]  Gobble up or split.
[02:54:32.866 --> 02:54:33.647]  She hates the space.
[02:54:33.647 --> 02:54:40.014]  She hates the space.
[02:54:40.014 --> 02:54:42.537]  Monday through Friday, we'll all gamble on liberty.
[02:54:42.537 --> 02:54:43.639]  Because that's no gamble at all.
[02:54:45.407 --> 02:54:46.988]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:54:46.988 --> 02:54:47.228]  to 2 p.m.
[02:54:47.228 --> 02:54:48.228]  I'm gonna go back to your calls.
[02:54:48.228 --> 02:54:50.249]  20 minutes to the next hour, I'll take calls.
[02:54:50.249 --> 02:54:52.910]  Then Jakari Jackson, David Knight, and them are coming in here.
[02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:55.390]  The four, five, six, whatever the crew can handle.
[02:54:55.390 --> 02:55:00.152]  These guys are getting bonuses in here, so be sure and buy lots of stuff at InfoWars.com so I can pay them.
[02:55:00.152 --> 02:55:01.692]  The crew is just awesome.
[02:55:01.692 --> 02:55:03.393]  The more you fund us, the harder I'll fight.
[02:55:03.393 --> 02:55:08.315]  Now let me stop right there.
[02:55:08.315 --> 02:55:11.836]  I was thinking during the break about all of this, and
[02:55:14.898 --> 02:55:19.917]  I was reading a comment here in an article, a Boston Marathon bombing, a staged terror attack.
[02:55:19.917 --> 02:55:20.680]  Let's punch this up.
[02:55:22.281 --> 02:55:24.962]  And let's read what Rough and Ready had to say.
[02:55:24.962 --> 02:55:30.905]  It says, when I first started to listen to the Alex Jones, I thought he was the biggest crackpot on the face of the earth.
[02:55:30.905 --> 02:55:32.426]  Most sincere apologies, Alex.
[02:55:32.426 --> 02:55:35.687]  I guess no one wants their comfort zone invaded by boogeymen.
[02:55:35.687 --> 02:55:39.869]  I am very glad that someone is on the tower paying attention to what's going on.
[02:55:39.869 --> 02:55:43.190]  I guess it would be like pulling guard duty for how long?
[02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:48.473]  Yeah, while watching the globalists commit all the crimes and nobody else can seem to see it because of their normalcy bias.
[02:55:49.709 --> 02:55:55.172]  Yeah, and watching everything overrun and kids dying of deadly vaccines, buddy, and then you can get it, okay?
[02:55:55.172 --> 02:55:56.493]  That's why I get like this.
[02:55:56.493 --> 02:56:00.175]  Because you just get so sick of watching it, you don't care anymore about what they do to you.
[02:56:00.175 --> 02:56:01.456]  You just want to defeat them.
[02:56:01.456 --> 02:56:03.097]  You want to stop it.
[02:56:03.097 --> 02:56:08.600]  I don't know how long you've been doing this, 18 years, but I say thank you for myself and my kids and grandbabies.
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:09.401]  Keep up the fight.
[02:56:09.401 --> 02:56:10.221]  Bravo.
[02:56:10.221 --> 02:56:13.383]  I suppose we all need to pull our heads out of our... and do something.
[02:56:13.783 --> 02:56:22.169]  Now everyone needs to focus on the superiors, the military, and the police forces so we can clean this mess up in an internal mop-up effort.
[02:56:22.169 --> 02:56:34.979]  When you find a person who strips the nose and the situation, are knowingly involved in trying to disarm us, shove the communist crap down our throats, defend freedom.
[02:56:34.979 --> 02:56:38.562]  Making sure that our children and grandchildren remain free is the most important job.
[02:56:38.562 --> 02:56:41.144]  A real American, once again, thanks Alex.
[02:56:42.958 --> 02:56:44.259]  And oh, oh, here's what I wanted to ask.
[02:56:44.259 --> 02:56:45.381]  I was thinking about it during the break.
[02:56:45.381 --> 02:56:48.964]  I keep seeing comments, and I've been so busy I haven't been able to look it up.
[02:56:48.964 --> 02:56:51.207]  Reportedly Tuesday night, or was it Wednesday night...
[02:56:52.719 --> 02:56:55.321]  I woke up at like midnight last night and was reading stuff about it.
[02:56:55.321 --> 02:57:02.865]  I saw it again that our favorite redcoat, Piers Morgan, more of his employees have been indicted for conspiracy.
[02:57:02.865 --> 02:57:06.067]  He looks really freaked out on TV.
[02:57:06.067 --> 02:57:10.649]  That scallywag reportedly had Robert Baer, the former CIA guy, on.
[02:57:10.649 --> 02:57:13.011]  By the way, I pocket dialed him two weeks ago accidentally.
[02:57:13.011 --> 02:57:15.672]  We have Robert Baer's number in there in Colorado.
[02:57:15.672 --> 02:57:17.333]  Call and try to get Baer on.
[02:57:17.333 --> 02:57:18.114]  And Baer was saying,
[02:57:18.934 --> 02:57:19.495]  Reportedly.
[02:57:19.495 --> 02:57:20.135]  I haven't seen this yet.
[02:57:20.135 --> 02:57:20.856]  I don't even know if it's true.
[02:57:20.856 --> 02:57:22.077]  I just keep seeing it on the web.
[02:57:22.077 --> 02:57:23.118]  I mean, it probably is.
[02:57:23.118 --> 02:57:25.300]  I see it multiple places.
[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:31.545]  That he was on Piers Morgan saying, this could be disgruntled Navy SEALs.
[02:57:31.545 --> 02:57:33.687]  And he was reading that off a teleprompter.
[02:57:33.687 --> 02:57:36.209]  Or he seemed upset while he was saying it.
[02:57:36.209 --> 02:57:38.211]  Was Robert Baer on there?
[02:57:38.211 --> 02:57:45.057]  Robert Baer on FBI investigation of the external extramarital affair that caused the resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus.
[02:57:45.057 --> 02:57:45.598]  No, that's not it.
[02:57:47.008 --> 02:57:49.929]  They said he was on Piers Morgan this week.
[02:57:49.929 --> 02:57:51.289]  I keep saying I don't even know that's true.
[02:57:51.289 --> 02:57:54.350]  Or maybe he was on something else and people have gotten the meme wrong.
[02:57:54.350 --> 02:57:55.290]  There's something to that.
[02:57:55.290 --> 02:57:58.851]  Robert Bear reportedly said this and I've seen it like five places.
[02:57:58.851 --> 02:58:00.192]  You see it on YouTube.
[02:58:00.192 --> 02:58:02.632]  Some people, InfoWars.
[02:58:02.632 --> 02:58:04.673]  You see it coming in an email.
[02:58:04.673 --> 02:58:05.813]  Well, send me a link then!
[02:58:05.813 --> 02:58:08.114]  I mean, I need your help, folks.
[02:58:08.114 --> 02:58:09.014]  I can't do all this.
[02:58:10.421 --> 02:58:12.622]  Now some stations don't care the next hour of overdrive.
[02:58:12.622 --> 02:58:18.906]  You'll need to go to InfoWars.com audio streams or InfoWars.com forward slash listen and there's a free video feed up there.
[02:58:18.906 --> 02:58:20.847]  We're going to continue this talk.
[02:58:20.847 --> 02:58:26.351]  Be sure to spread the word about all our Aminathem affiliates and support their local sponsors and become a sponsor.
[02:58:26.351 --> 02:58:32.134]  And I don't know, John Harmon was saying a whole passel of new stations are wanting to sign up right now.
[02:58:32.134 --> 02:58:33.916]  So people are getting what's happening.
[02:58:34.816 --> 02:58:39.021]  And better look your grandbabies and kids in the eyes and realize we don't beat these people.
[02:58:39.021 --> 02:58:42.945]  We're going under Soviet-style occupation mixed in with some Hitler.
[02:58:42.945 --> 02:58:46.288]  So, fourth hour coming up into the fifth and sixth hour of the nightly news.
[02:58:46.288 --> 02:58:47.049]  Seven o'clock tonight.

[03:00:25.270 --> 03:00:29.593]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.593 --> 03:00:39.541]  Alright, I'll shut up and try to go to calls quickly now.
[03:00:39.541 --> 03:00:40.542]  Colin.
[03:00:40.542 --> 03:00:42.063]  Colin in Canada, you're on the air.
[03:00:42.063 --> 03:00:42.504]  Welcome, sir.
[03:00:43.868 --> 03:00:44.789]  Hello, Alex.
[03:00:44.789 --> 03:00:45.970]  Hey, buddy.
[03:00:45.970 --> 03:00:48.132]  Yeah, I got a couple of points here, man.
[03:00:48.132 --> 03:00:54.518]  Um, the first one is, uh, for the Patsies, Billy Joe, Jim Bob, and, uh, the other ones that they were about to crucify.
[03:00:55.393 --> 03:00:56.874]  Um, I'm gonna put it like this, man.
[03:00:56.874 --> 03:00:58.994]  These guys are in extreme danger.
[03:00:58.994 --> 03:01:04.956]  Because when the system changes paths that way and goes a different direction, uh, they don't just leave the other one out in the open.
[03:01:04.956 --> 03:01:06.837]  They have to execute and erase that.
[03:01:06.837 --> 03:01:14.119]  So you guys have to come out, uh, if even one of them is listening, uh, you guys have to come out and come forward with everything that you know... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:01:14.119 --> 03:01:15.340]  They pulled into the courthouse.
[03:01:15.340 --> 03:01:17.040]  They were about to roll out the guy.
[03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:18.021]  They said, we have the guy.
[03:01:18.021 --> 03:01:18.881]  We've arrested him.
[03:01:18.881 --> 03:01:19.421]  We think did it.
[03:01:19.421 --> 03:01:20.482]  We're gonna roll it out at five.
[03:01:20.482 --> 03:01:23.903]  And then, oh my gosh, bomb threat and army trucks pull in and pull out with a guy.
[03:01:24.403 --> 03:01:24.823]  Perhaps.
[03:01:24.823 --> 03:01:26.545]  And my other point, Alex, is that
[03:01:42.722 --> 03:01:43.162]  I don't
[03:02:02.090 --> 03:02:07.154]  Well, I mean, more and more, if a cop is breaking the law, you're supposed to be able to citizen arrest them, but they'll shoot you.
[03:02:07.154 --> 03:02:14.200]  I mean, they're on such a power trip, not all the cops, a lot of cops are waking up, that the globalists have overplayed their hand, overcooked this.
[03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:17.603]  It's the opposite of half-baked, they've over-baked it.
[03:02:17.603 --> 03:02:24.368]  You've got to really reach out and go, come on, break the trance, and with cops, go, treat me with respect, stop doing what you're doing, stop violating my rights.
[03:02:24.368 --> 03:02:27.030]  And if they arrest you for no reason, you sue them.
[03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:28.651]  By the way, we have the veteran on at three.
[03:02:30.301 --> 03:02:35.663]  The highly decorated combat vet who was just walking out by a farm with a rifle and the cops arrested him.
[03:02:35.663 --> 03:02:37.124]  I've got him on the nightly news tonight.
[03:02:37.124 --> 03:02:46.148]  I'm going to tape that at 3 and then it'll be live tonight and the guys will air my interview at the end of the live 7 o'clock to 8 it'll be live and then we'll air the taped interview with the fella.
[03:02:46.148 --> 03:02:47.789]  But that's set up now.
[03:02:47.789 --> 03:02:50.410]  And you know those Temple cops need to be fired.
[03:02:50.410 --> 03:02:54.351]  I mean the guy, they grabbed him, they were the ones that assaulted him.
[03:02:55.753 --> 03:02:56.715]  He didn't do anything.
[03:02:56.715 --> 03:03:01.590]  And it's really hard when a cop grabs you for no reason to not, you know, push him back.
[03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:02.392]  I mean, it's just, it's wrong.
[03:03:04.053 --> 03:03:05.014]  You know, you know, it's wrong.
[03:03:05.014 --> 03:03:07.416]  I mean, you know, one time a guy started a fight with me.
[03:03:07.416 --> 03:03:11.659]  I was beating him up pretty bad and the football coach ran into the cafeteria and grabbed me.
[03:03:11.659 --> 03:03:17.224]  He was a big guy and I didn't resist him and slammed me up against the wall because he, you know, had to get fired up to be able to grab me and do that.
[03:03:17.224 --> 03:03:19.026]  I had to hit him because he was on the right.
[03:03:19.026 --> 03:03:20.227]  I was kicking the guy's butt.
[03:03:20.227 --> 03:03:25.491]  But you don't just come over to some guy, done nothing and just go, come here and just grab him and slam him on things.
[03:03:25.491 --> 03:03:27.393]  I mean, I would really have trouble putting up with that.
[03:03:28.012 --> 03:03:32.144]  I mean, I'm tired of men who want to assault us, but we can't fight back.
[03:03:32.144 --> 03:03:33.147]  It's cowardly.
[03:03:33.147 --> 03:03:33.769]  Don't you agree?
[03:03:35.697 --> 03:03:39.818]  I think that the law provides that you can fight back, and that's what I'm trying to say.
[03:03:39.818 --> 03:03:42.859]  No, that's what Indiana, to repass a law stating that.
[03:03:42.859 --> 03:03:44.640]  That's in common law, man.
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:47.461]  If our servants are out of order, we have every right to defend ourselves.
[03:03:47.461 --> 03:03:49.901]  But I mean, I don't want to fight with the police.
[03:03:49.901 --> 03:03:51.542]  I don't want you to be my enemy.
[03:03:51.542 --> 03:03:54.663]  I don't buy into the propaganda of you're all a bunch of pig demons.
[03:03:54.663 --> 03:03:56.123]  The government's corrupt.
[03:03:56.123 --> 03:03:57.944]  They're trying to make you do bad things.
[03:03:57.944 --> 03:03:59.104]  I want to wake you up.
[03:03:59.104 --> 03:04:00.384]  I want to save America.
[03:04:00.384 --> 03:04:02.345]  I want our children to grow together into the future.
[03:04:02.805 --> 03:04:08.409]  And I think most cops want that, especially older ones, who've been around and aren't on power trips anymore.
[03:04:08.409 --> 03:04:18.396]  It's the young, steroid-head ones bugging their eyes out, and I'm like, dude, you know, see one downtown bugging their eyes out, you just look at him and you go, you really want to act tough and sit here and do this?
[03:04:18.396 --> 03:04:27.143]  You may be able to kick my butt, but if you've actually assaulted me, you're going to get in a fight with somebody who literally blacks out and goes 110%, and then I know they'd end up just shooting me.
[03:04:27.623 --> 03:04:30.285]  I mean, it scares me how cowardly they are.
[03:04:30.285 --> 03:04:35.508]  It scares me that, you know, they want to play Captain Caveman and they're not Captain Caveman.
[03:04:35.508 --> 03:04:37.169]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:04:37.169 --> 03:04:38.670]  Yeah, I get it.
[03:04:38.670 --> 03:04:41.632]  I mean, you know, it's just, it's just, I don't want to even get off on the cops.
[03:04:41.632 --> 03:04:43.133]  I'm so sick of it.
[03:04:43.133 --> 03:04:45.275]  It's just, it's more than hating people.
[03:04:45.275 --> 03:04:46.676]  I'm disgusted.
[03:04:46.676 --> 03:04:48.217]  I want good things for them.
[03:04:48.217 --> 03:04:51.679]  But I open the phones up for cops, they load the lines agreeing.
[03:04:51.679 --> 03:04:54.080]  I run into cops, most cops I run into cops downtown.
[03:04:54.080 --> 03:04:55.181]  It's like a celebrity event.
[03:04:55.181 --> 03:04:55.902]  They're all listeners.
[03:04:57.199 --> 03:04:59.062]  They're like, we're sorry we're told to write tickets.
[03:04:59.062 --> 03:04:59.963]  We don't like it either.
[03:04:59.963 --> 03:05:01.826]  By the way, I like your show.
[03:05:01.826 --> 03:05:03.469]  I'm like, why don't you say no to the orders?
[03:05:03.469 --> 03:05:04.210]  Well, we did.
[03:05:04.210 --> 03:05:05.292]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:05.292 --> 03:05:05.973]  Stay with us.
[03:05:08.638 --> 03:05:10.539]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:05:10.539 --> 03:05:14.181]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[03:05:14.181 --> 03:05:18.724]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:05:18.724 --> 03:05:24.848]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:05:24.848 --> 03:05:35.614]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[03:05:35.814 --> 03:05:38.676]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.
[03:05:38.676 --> 03:05:42.319]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[03:05:42.319 --> 03:05:57.050]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands.
[03:05:57.270 --> 03:06:01.294]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[03:06:01.294 --> 03:06:02.856]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[03:06:02.856 --> 03:06:03.536]  Police call it robbery.
[03:06:21.829 --> 03:06:23.711]  We call it avoidable.
[03:06:23.711 --> 03:06:29.758]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.

[03:06:35.165 --> 03:06:41.212]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[03:06:42.393 --> 03:06:49.439]  At only $29.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.

[03:07:08.410 --> 03:07:11.473]  The coming financial collapse is real.
[03:07:11.473 --> 03:07:14.676]  The subsequent social unrest will happen.
[03:07:14.676 --> 03:07:19.140]  Even if you made it out of suburbia alive, where would you take your family?

[03:08:00.905 --> 03:08:18.389]  Defense Survival Retreat Consulting dot com Survival Retreat Consulting dot com Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[03:08:20.834 --> 03:08:23.056]  We're good to go.
[03:08:58.699 --> 03:09:00.423]  We got the photos of...
[03:09:08.263 --> 03:09:13.107]  Navy SEALs, not just the ones we had yesterday, crawling all over the finish line.
[03:09:13.107 --> 03:09:16.611]  Yards, in some cases, from where the bomb went off.
[03:09:16.611 --> 03:09:18.192]  With big black backpacks.
[03:09:18.192 --> 03:09:21.915]  And the media will not touch this and has lied and said there was no drill.
[03:09:21.915 --> 03:09:24.858]  That witnesses said they were told, be calm, don't worry about all this.
[03:09:24.858 --> 03:09:27.981]  Because obviously people with black backpacks everywhere, it's pretty obvious.
[03:09:27.981 --> 03:09:28.681]  And they have the...
[03:09:29.562 --> 03:09:33.164]  You know, they have the Patsy's there, all of it.
[03:09:33.164 --> 03:09:44.531]  The only way this isn't purely staged and 100% government is they found mentally ill, which even the New York Times, guys just type in New York Times, FBI terror.
[03:09:44.531 --> 03:09:46.273]  You know the article, came out last April 28th.
[03:09:47.486 --> 03:10:05.562]  Where they admitted, there's over a hundred cases, where the government, and of course we expose this, but the New York Times even admits it, come on, that they totally find mentally ill people, on average 75 IQ, they have a whole formulae, Muslim, right wing, left wing, doesn't matter, mentally ill, and they wind them up to do it.
[03:10:05.562 --> 03:10:13.309]  And the bare minimum is, I mean, you look at the pad seats, they look like, I mean, if you saw these guys at a bus stop, you'd say, that's a mental patient.
[03:10:14.161 --> 03:10:19.483]  You look at who we believe they were going to go with as the Patsy because they were already saying the right wing did it.
[03:10:19.483 --> 03:10:22.025]  They jumped the gun, they screwed up.
[03:10:22.025 --> 03:10:27.147]  So I know you're all watching right now the Globalist Stars, so take lessons here next time you do this if you want to get away with it.
[03:10:27.147 --> 03:10:28.127]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[03:10:28.127 --> 03:10:31.249]  We're all watching you.
[03:10:31.249 --> 03:10:32.909]  We're watching you.
[03:10:32.909 --> 03:10:38.712]  You think you're watching us and you say, we're going to stick our hands down your pants and now the Army's going to look at your papers.
[03:10:38.712 --> 03:10:39.872]  Okay, good.
[03:10:39.872 --> 03:10:41.053]  We're watching you.
[03:10:41.053 --> 03:10:42.934]  How do you like that?
[03:10:44.042 --> 03:10:44.962]  And that's it, man.
[03:10:44.962 --> 03:10:47.183]  Army shows up around Austin, I'm going to confront them.
[03:10:47.183 --> 03:10:48.404]  I'm done.
[03:10:48.404 --> 03:10:48.804]  I'm done.
[03:10:48.804 --> 03:10:50.985]  I'm going to go get in their face.
[03:10:50.985 --> 03:10:55.006]  I'm going to say, the government staged the attack, and you're violating posse comitatus.
[03:10:55.006 --> 03:10:56.227]  Get out of here!
[03:10:56.227 --> 03:11:02.249]  You're not going to come up to me with my wife and check our papers and search our bags about protecting me.
[03:11:02.249 --> 03:11:05.030]  Your boss has ran these attacks, and I'm sick of it!
[03:11:06.397 --> 03:11:06.917]  It's simple.
[03:11:06.917 --> 03:11:10.098]  You want jurisdiction into my life to get over the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:11:10.098 --> 03:11:13.359]  Your bosses are staging this while they butcher America.
[03:11:13.359 --> 03:11:14.280]  I'm done.
[03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:15.700]  I don't live in Baghdad.
[03:11:15.700 --> 03:11:17.401]  I don't live in the West Bank of Israel.
[03:11:17.401 --> 03:11:20.522]  Get your hands off my God-given rights.
[03:11:20.522 --> 03:11:22.903]  Comprende!
[03:11:22.903 --> 03:11:25.764]  Do you speak Constitution?
[03:11:25.764 --> 03:11:28.125]  You comprehend that, jackass?
[03:11:28.125 --> 03:11:29.005]  Excuse me, folks.
[03:11:29.005 --> 03:11:30.405]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:11:30.405 --> 03:11:33.766]  Go ahead.
[03:11:33.766 --> 03:11:34.647]  Joe in Texas, sorry.
[03:11:34.647 --> 03:11:35.007]  Go ahead.
[03:11:36.321 --> 03:11:36.988]  This is Joe?
[03:11:36.988 --> 03:11:37.392]  Yes, sir.
[03:11:37.392 --> 03:11:37.917]  Go ahead, Joe.
[03:11:38.686 --> 03:11:40.467]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:11:40.467 --> 03:11:42.569]  I want to make, I'll be very quick.
[03:11:42.569 --> 03:11:48.233]  Number one, I wanted to say to your listeners that I've watched, I've listened to you for over three years.
[03:11:48.233 --> 03:11:51.335]  I have read probably 50 books as a result of listening to you.
[03:11:51.335 --> 03:12:03.424]  I can tell your listeners out there that InfoWars is an extremely credible organization and the fact that you do things on such an evidence-based way of approaching the news and stuff, I totally agree with.
[03:12:03.424 --> 03:12:07.127]  I'm an attorney, so I take that very seriously and I appreciate what you do.
[03:12:07.127 --> 03:12:07.608]  Thank you sir.
[03:12:08.488 --> 03:12:15.042]  The reason I called today was to give you a little different perspective, or my perspective, on this Boston thing.
[03:12:16.219 --> 03:12:32.363]  In looking at it, I know everybody's talking about the importance of what I've really seen revealed over the last day or two, because I've been lucky enough to be home and watched all this unfold on PrisonPlanet.tv, which has been great for me.
[03:12:32.363 --> 03:12:36.744]  But it's about the power of the media, about the power of the visual media.
[03:12:36.744 --> 03:12:43.866]  The fact that so many perspectives and cameras, operationally, have been at this event, and it's been very hard for things to be hidden.
[03:12:44.446 --> 03:12:57.191]  I've seen the authorities attempt to use this to shape the story they want, and I've seen, more importantly, people like yourself and other people who have given information to InfoWars help shape the truth.
[03:12:57.191 --> 03:13:09.697]  And so the moral of the story for me is that this phenomena of visual media, this phenomena, is actually what's allowing the truth to unfold for us all.
[03:13:09.697 --> 03:13:12.858]  Now, having said that, here's my unusual perspective.
[03:13:13.482 --> 03:13:23.393]  Because I've seen such a powerful event take place because of all the media and all the visual footage from different angles, different people and sources.
[03:13:23.393 --> 03:13:25.355]  And historically, my mind goes back.
[03:13:26.081 --> 03:13:41.540]  To the fact that we have had this kind of thing occur before, and I'm speaking specifically of Oklahoma City, the Pentagon, 9-11, Sandy Hook, places we know that there's tons of visual information on, but it's being suppressed.
[03:13:41.540 --> 03:13:44.404]  And so here, it just to me illuminates
[03:13:45.084 --> 03:13:50.426]  And incriminates the government even further for withholding what we know exists.
[03:13:50.426 --> 03:13:51.387]  Well, think about this.
[03:13:51.387 --> 03:14:04.732]  These photos of the redneck suspects, of the Saudi suspects, surrounded by their handlers, Army and Navy Special Forces just crawling right beside them, and a drill they're lying about.
[03:14:05.592 --> 03:14:07.493]  And again, we're not saying the Navy SEALs did this.
[03:14:07.493 --> 03:14:21.978]  They're called out for the drill to create the confusion, and then whatever the group is from a, you know, non-profit, government-funded, liberal think tank, we all know who, folks, was involved in other events, they can then go have their patsy do it.
[03:14:21.978 --> 03:14:22.038]  Or...
[03:14:22.998 --> 03:14:25.840]  And this is the minority of events, because they usually are too stupid to do it.
[03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:29.122]  They may have found idiots that they wound up and let do it.
[03:14:29.122 --> 03:14:32.485]  And they've been caught doing that quite a few times.
[03:14:32.485 --> 03:14:35.126]  Regardless, you keep your hands off my rights.
[03:14:35.126 --> 03:14:37.968]  You've got probably 50 people dead from this fertilizer explosion.
[03:14:37.968 --> 03:14:39.289]  Nobody knows.
[03:14:39.289 --> 03:14:40.570]  And it's like, give up our rights?
[03:14:40.570 --> 03:14:42.952]  Are we going to ban factories?
[03:14:42.952 --> 03:14:46.895]  They've had factories blow up in Houston and kill hundreds of people.
[03:14:47.657 --> 03:14:51.400]  They had a hurricane that killed 10,000 people once in Galveston.
[03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:52.620]  Are we going to ban hurricanes?
[03:14:52.620 --> 03:14:58.745]  The point is they obsess over these dead to try to sell us that our rights somehow did it.
[03:14:58.745 --> 03:14:59.865]  And you know what?
[03:14:59.865 --> 03:15:04.729]  If I try to go somewhere or I run into one of these public events and the Army wants to search me, I'm not putting up with it.
[03:15:04.729 --> 03:15:05.829]  And none of us should.
[03:15:05.829 --> 03:15:10.833]  Because they had 400 troops already out there, 2,000 police, and this still happened.
[03:15:10.833 --> 03:15:12.114]  That's the moral of the story.
[03:15:12.114 --> 03:15:13.655]  You had Navy SEALs
[03:15:14.775 --> 03:15:18.398]  Well, it looks like 20 feet to me, but let's just say 60 feet.
[03:15:18.398 --> 03:15:22.340]  We're talking a stone's throw from the bombs, and it didn't protect you.
[03:15:22.340 --> 03:15:25.062]  We cannot have Navy SEALs on every street corner.
[03:15:25.062 --> 03:15:26.884]  And if we did, it won't protect us.
[03:15:26.884 --> 03:15:31.427]  So I want my rights, and they're mine, and I am demanding them.
[03:15:31.427 --> 03:15:32.908]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[03:15:32.908 --> 03:15:34.989]  And you know in law, Joe, it's about demanding rights.
[03:15:34.989 --> 03:15:36.871]  Rights aren't just given.
[03:15:36.871 --> 03:15:37.531]  They are demanded.
[03:15:37.531 --> 03:15:38.372]  They are demanded.
[03:15:41.684 --> 03:15:44.027]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tracy in Utah.
[03:15:44.027 --> 03:15:44.647]  You're on the air.
[03:15:44.647 --> 03:15:46.970]  Welcome.
[03:15:46.970 --> 03:15:47.811]  Oh, hey.
[03:15:47.811 --> 03:15:50.314]  Hey Tracy, talk right into your phone for me, honey.
[03:15:50.314 --> 03:15:51.215]  Oh, can you hear me now?
[03:15:51.215 --> 03:15:51.635]  Yes, I can.
[03:15:51.635 --> 03:15:51.896]  Go ahead.
[03:15:53.100 --> 03:15:55.881]  First of all, it's an honor to actually get to talk to you.
[03:15:55.881 --> 03:16:07.905]  Me and my boss Sonia listen to you every single day and we are passionate and we know that we have to get out there and get the public to see what's going on and to write letters.
[03:16:07.905 --> 03:16:18.169]  And that was one of my questions was, I would like to write letters to the editors here in Utah and I wanted to know if I could use info words, your name and the reporter who they took a picture of.
[03:16:18.169 --> 03:16:19.570]  Let me explain how the first amendment works.
[03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:33.356]  Hollywood, if it's for entertainment or something sold as entertainment, you have to get basically permission for pretty much anything unless it's a public figure or something well known.
[03:16:33.356 --> 03:16:34.617]  Everything else is wide open.
[03:16:34.617 --> 03:16:38.939]  I don't need permission to shoot news footage on the street in a public place and put it on TV.
[03:16:38.939 --> 03:16:42.661]  We'll be filming all the time and somebody will walk through our image and go, you're not allowed to film me.
[03:16:42.661 --> 03:16:44.702]  And I'm like, it's for news, sir.
[03:16:44.702 --> 03:16:45.002]  Sue me.
[03:16:46.042 --> 03:16:50.565]  So somebody explained, you can use InfoWars anywhere as long as you're not selling something out of it.
[03:16:50.565 --> 03:16:53.527]  You can talk about InfoWars in a novel you write.
[03:16:53.527 --> 03:16:57.369]  Even if it is fiction, you can put it on a bumper sticker.
[03:16:57.369 --> 03:16:59.591]  People always ask, can I write about what you're doing?
[03:16:59.591 --> 03:17:02.732]  And I'm like, of course you can, but not because I authorize you to.
[03:17:02.732 --> 03:17:06.095]  So yes, do whatever you want.
[03:17:06.095 --> 03:17:07.956]  Everybody's got permission for whatever they want to do.
[03:17:08.516 --> 03:17:08.857]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:17:26.440 --> 03:17:30.683]  Fair use for all of you, but not by me giving you that fair use right.
[03:17:30.683 --> 03:17:32.425]  That fair use is inherent.
[03:17:32.425 --> 03:17:34.126]  So study fair use, ma'am.
[03:17:34.126 --> 03:17:37.669]  But absolutely, feel free to write letters to the editor all the time.
[03:17:37.669 --> 03:17:41.351]  Every day we get emails, can I write a letter to the editor about InfoWars.com?
[03:17:41.351 --> 03:17:43.073]  Well, yeah, of course you can.
[03:17:43.073 --> 03:17:49.858]  You can write a letter to the editor about how you like the Cowboys, or about how you like strawberries, or how you like Vincent Van Gogh.
[03:17:49.858 --> 03:17:51.719]  I mean, you can write about how you like
[03:17:54.141 --> 03:17:56.742]  Gerard Depardieu, or however you say his name.
[03:17:56.742 --> 03:17:57.862]  Or how you like George Lucas.
[03:17:57.862 --> 03:17:58.963]  I mean, whatever.
[03:17:58.963 --> 03:17:59.663]  You can do whatever.
[03:17:59.663 --> 03:18:01.384]  Or how you like Drudge Report.
[03:18:01.384 --> 03:18:02.764]  You know, letters to the owner about Drudge Report.
[03:18:02.764 --> 03:18:03.144]  Great idea.
[03:18:03.144 --> 03:18:05.865]  I mean, you can do whatever you want, but it's not that I'm giving you the permission.
[03:18:05.865 --> 03:18:06.526]  You understand?
[03:18:06.526 --> 03:18:07.226]  You already have it.
[03:18:09.087 --> 03:18:09.807]  Well, that's okay.
[03:18:09.807 --> 03:18:13.688]  Well, I just want me and my boss and others believe exactly like you.
[03:18:13.688 --> 03:18:17.349]  If we don't stand up and fight for our rights, we're going to lose them.
[03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:18.830]  And people have to wake up.
[03:18:18.830 --> 03:18:21.431]  And that's what we want to do is get the word out.
[03:18:21.431 --> 03:18:25.292]  Well, they think you're so stupid that they had all these operatives there when they did these bombs.
[03:18:26.352 --> 03:18:28.393]  And again, they weren't there looking for a bomb either.
[03:18:28.393 --> 03:18:30.675]  It was totally staged.
[03:18:30.675 --> 03:18:33.176]  And now they're covering up who they know really did it.
[03:18:33.176 --> 03:18:34.737]  You think we have ideas?
[03:18:34.737 --> 03:18:36.258]  They know because they did it.
[03:18:36.258 --> 03:18:37.379]  This is an investigation.
[03:18:37.379 --> 03:18:39.900]  This is a wedding of the appetite.
[03:18:39.900 --> 03:18:42.882]  So people need to get our articles on this out to everybody.
[03:18:43.482 --> 03:18:44.562]  Alex, good to talk to you.
[03:18:44.562 --> 03:18:45.403]  Hey, um, I know it's early.
[03:19:03.479 --> 03:19:08.542]  But the fertilizer plant in Texas, there are some videos surfacing on the internet.
[03:19:08.542 --> 03:19:11.364]  Some people have taken videos from different vantage points.
[03:19:11.364 --> 03:19:15.267]  Yeah, you see the fire jump, jump from about 100 yards away into the building.
[03:19:15.267 --> 03:19:21.290]  But that's the fumes of the cooking, cooking fertilizer and then it just like gasoline fumes catches on fire.
[03:19:21.290 --> 03:19:22.211]  I don't think it's a missile.
[03:19:22.211 --> 03:19:23.452]  Go ahead.
[03:19:23.452 --> 03:19:26.414]  What I see is something that's moving against the wind.
[03:19:26.414 --> 03:19:29.936]  The smoke is moving off in one direction and there's something actually coming in.
[03:19:32.099 --> 03:19:33.420]  I've seen something looks like that.
[03:19:33.420 --> 03:19:36.263]  I just don't know anymore.
[03:19:36.263 --> 03:19:41.888]  I mean, would they blow up something to divert away from the bombshell that their whole op got blown?
[03:19:41.888 --> 03:19:43.109]  They canceled all this stuff?
[03:19:43.109 --> 03:19:43.570]  Yes.
[03:19:43.570 --> 03:19:45.431]  I mean, it is a possibility.
[03:19:45.431 --> 03:19:48.154]  But I mean, everything can't be a conspiracy.
[03:19:48.154 --> 03:19:49.615]  I mean, I just I have to see proof.
[03:19:49.615 --> 03:19:52.858]  But yeah, the videos are suspicious.
[03:19:52.858 --> 03:19:54.480]  There's a mass awakening.
[03:19:54.480 --> 03:19:56.902]  I mean, your ratings is a testament to it.
[03:19:57.829 --> 03:19:58.750]  People are really on the ball.
[03:19:58.750 --> 03:20:04.593]  It's amazing how fast the cover stories are falling apart for the Boston bombing.
[03:20:04.593 --> 03:20:09.716]  People are just, they're looking and they're skeptical and they're going to break these stories.
[03:20:09.716 --> 03:20:16.299]  One other thing I'd like to bring up is the reason we can have such conversations about these false flag attacks.
[03:20:16.299 --> 03:20:22.343]  I think one of the deadliest false flag attacks on American soil, 9-11, has woke a lot of people up.
[03:20:22.343 --> 03:20:24.484]  And the organization that has done, I think, more than
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:26.041]  I hear you, brother.
[03:20:26.041 --> 03:20:26.801]  God bless you.
[03:20:26.801 --> 03:20:27.502]  Good to hear from you.
[03:20:27.502 --> 03:20:28.443]  Let's go to Julio in Illinois.
[03:20:28.443 --> 03:20:30.244]  He's been a We Are Change reporter.
[03:20:30.244 --> 03:20:31.385]  He's done great work for us as well.
[03:20:31.385 --> 03:20:32.686]  This is, indeed, Julio.
[03:20:32.686 --> 03:20:33.327]  I recognize his voice.
[03:20:33.327 --> 03:20:34.147]  Julio, is that you, my friend?
[03:20:52.489 --> 03:20:53.109]  It is, Alex.
[03:20:53.109 --> 03:20:53.570]  Aloha.
[03:20:53.570 --> 03:20:54.470]  How are you, my friend?
[03:20:54.470 --> 03:20:54.871]  Good, man.
[03:20:54.871 --> 03:20:56.432]  This is crazy what's going on.
[03:20:56.432 --> 03:20:58.293]  What's your take?
[03:20:58.293 --> 03:20:59.514]  Absolutely, it's crazy.
[03:20:59.514 --> 03:21:01.715]  Great job with the work.
[03:21:01.715 --> 03:21:10.081]  I mean, what I do when big events happen, I stay away from the corporate media and I go straight to local media.
[03:21:10.081 --> 03:21:12.362]  And that's what I did on Monday.
[03:21:12.362 --> 03:21:13.603]  And I was able to record WC
[03:21:15.114 --> 03:21:28.938]  VB, it's a Boston ABC owned and operated affiliate ABC 5, and one of their reporters, I found this very interesting, said that the head of FEMA, which is Craig Fugate, was in Boston.
[03:21:28.938 --> 03:21:29.578]  Oh no, that's true.
[03:21:29.578 --> 03:21:30.559]  They were all there.
[03:21:30.559 --> 03:21:31.839]  They were all there.
[03:21:31.839 --> 03:21:33.940]  Just like they were all there for 7-7 bombing.
[03:21:33.940 --> 03:21:35.360]  Yeah, no, that is confirmed, yes.
[03:21:37.601 --> 03:21:39.762]  It's just so fascinating to see.
[03:21:39.762 --> 03:21:41.944]  Just watching yesterday, corporate media.
[03:21:41.944 --> 03:21:43.025]  Oh, we found someone.
[03:21:43.025 --> 03:21:44.406]  They arrested someone.
[03:21:44.406 --> 03:21:45.767]  John King of CNN.
[03:21:45.767 --> 03:21:48.008]  Oh, it's a dark-skinned male.
[03:21:48.008 --> 03:21:51.551]  And then, within 15 minutes, oh wait, we don't have that.
[03:21:51.551 --> 03:21:54.353]  Wolf Blitzer on Monday said numerous times,
[03:21:54.833 --> 03:22:03.736]  Remember folks, first reports may always be false, and then two minutes later they have someone on plugging the white extremists, the right-wing extremists.
[03:22:03.736 --> 03:22:09.298]  Last summer, I was at Oak Creek, Wisconsin following the Sikh Temple shooting, and I had the U.S.
[03:22:09.298 --> 03:22:20.002]  District Attorney of Wisconsin, James Pantelli, admit to me that the government likes to use those types of labels, even though they have no proof that someone with a domestic
[03:22:20.442 --> 03:22:21.523]  Well, let's stop right there.
[03:22:21.523 --> 03:22:26.426]  Next time there's a bombing or shooting in your area, immediately go to it.
[03:22:26.426 --> 03:22:31.108]  And, I mean, you may see feds standing over kids shooting them, you know, to have a higher death count.
[03:22:31.108 --> 03:22:33.650]  I mean, they act like they can cover everything up.
[03:22:33.650 --> 03:22:45.777]  And, but listen, just like I said with Kurt Haskell when they caught the government getting him on the plane and later it was confirmed, and the FBI came to his office, tried to intimidate him, we are blowing every one of their ops now because this isn't the old game.
[03:22:45.777 --> 03:22:47.598]  We know their tricks.
[03:22:47.598 --> 03:22:48.139]  But still,
[03:22:49.359 --> 03:22:51.501]  They have such disdain for the public.
[03:22:51.501 --> 03:22:53.803]  They don't care if we're out here exposing them.
[03:22:53.803 --> 03:22:56.084]  They're like, oh, we'll just call them conspiracy theorists.
[03:22:56.084 --> 03:22:57.305]  But it doesn't work anymore.
[03:22:57.305 --> 03:22:58.986]  I mean, do people understand?
[03:22:58.986 --> 03:23:03.850]  I called Watson this morning and I said, this is 20 times bigger than anything we've ever been part of.
[03:23:03.850 --> 03:23:04.851]  God bless what's happened.
[03:23:04.851 --> 03:23:05.932]  Good job.
[03:23:05.932 --> 03:23:09.054]  You know, right now we've exposed it's a false flag, but now we have to get it out to everybody.
[03:23:09.054 --> 03:23:09.814]  But we have the proof.
[03:23:09.814 --> 03:23:10.655]  We have them.
[03:23:10.655 --> 03:23:11.976]  We have them now.
[03:23:11.976 --> 03:23:13.817]  And I said, no, no, it's not a 20 times bigger.
[03:23:13.817 --> 03:23:15.819]  It's 100 times bigger.
[03:23:15.819 --> 03:23:17.100]  I cannot tell you, Julio,
[03:23:18.536 --> 03:23:19.317]  I'm sure you know this.
[03:23:19.317 --> 03:23:22.259]  We have caught them with their pants off.
[03:23:22.259 --> 03:23:23.860]  I mean, we have them.
[03:23:23.860 --> 03:23:24.841]  I mean, we have them.
[03:23:24.841 --> 03:23:28.163]  And lying about the drill, we have these bastards.
[03:23:28.163 --> 03:23:33.186]  And, praise God, I mean, it shows commitment.
[03:23:33.186 --> 03:23:36.469]  If you are committed and you study and you focus and you work,
[03:23:36.989 --> 03:23:38.050]  These are men, too.
[03:23:38.050 --> 03:23:39.271]  That's why they're so scared of us.
[03:23:39.271 --> 03:23:42.073]  It's why they put poison in our water to dumb us down.
[03:23:42.073 --> 03:23:45.195]  Once you're conscious of what they've done to us, you just gut up more in your brain.
[03:23:45.195 --> 03:23:49.278]  I mean, if you tell yourself to boost your IQ, it'll boost in a crisis.
[03:23:49.278 --> 03:23:55.042]  Humanity needs to get out of this slug-like, slug-like trance and take action, Julio.
[03:23:55.042 --> 03:23:56.123]  And we're gonna win this thing.
[03:23:56.123 --> 03:23:56.523]  Anything else?
[03:23:57.577 --> 03:23:58.017]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:23:58.017 --> 03:23:59.158]  I can only speak from experience.
[03:23:59.158 --> 03:24:00.339]  I covered the NATO Summit.
[03:24:00.339 --> 03:24:02.000]  I was officially credentialed for that.
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:09.884]  And I can speak from experience covering high-profile events that they make sure to check your bags before you enter anywhere.
[03:24:09.884 --> 03:24:12.326]  I was checked by Secret Service in the media.
[03:24:12.326 --> 03:24:12.586]  No, no.
[03:24:12.586 --> 03:24:14.527]  They admit they had people searching bags.
[03:24:14.527 --> 03:24:15.507]  You see, bombshell.
[03:24:15.507 --> 03:24:16.548]  You just said it.
[03:24:16.548 --> 03:24:17.489]  They are on record.
[03:24:17.489 --> 03:24:20.730]  In fact, tell my writers right now to look this up because I heard it on the news.
[03:24:20.730 --> 03:24:23.232]  They were searching bags at the start and finish line.
[03:24:23.232 --> 03:24:24.533]  Why then did they let
[03:24:25.693 --> 03:24:28.216]  20 people or more in with giant black backpacks.
[03:24:28.216 --> 03:24:30.117]  I mean, this is so incredibly obvious.
[03:24:30.117 --> 03:24:33.300]  How did the bombs get in when everybody was being searched?
[03:24:33.300 --> 03:24:37.363]  Again, inside job, anybody.
[03:24:37.363 --> 03:24:42.208]  For them to say, oh, we did a bomb sweep twice, that's a lie.
[03:24:42.208 --> 03:24:43.309]  I covered NATO.
[03:24:43.309 --> 03:24:45.631]  They did bomb sweeps every 30 minutes.
[03:24:45.631 --> 03:24:48.473]  They made sure nothing entered that wasn't supposed
[03:24:48.837 --> 03:24:52.720]  Because that's actual globalists who might actually get bombed by one of their compadres.
[03:24:52.720 --> 03:24:53.781]  I mean, there's real infighting.
[03:24:53.781 --> 03:24:54.642]  Exactly.
[03:24:54.642 --> 03:24:55.042]  No, no, no.
[03:24:55.042 --> 03:24:57.844]  You get a proctology exam near a G-20 or anything.
[03:24:57.844 --> 03:24:58.805]  I mean, this is incredible.
[03:24:58.805 --> 03:24:59.445]  Thank you, Julio.
[03:24:59.445 --> 03:25:00.646]  Great points.
[03:25:00.646 --> 03:25:01.667]  Get that video out on YouTube.
[03:25:01.667 --> 03:25:02.928]  You may have already done it.
[03:25:02.928 --> 03:25:04.689]  Let's talk to Jeremy.
[03:25:04.689 --> 03:25:07.692]  You're on the air, Jeremy, from Indiana.
[03:25:07.692 --> 03:25:08.552]  Alex, hi, Jeremy.
[03:25:08.552 --> 03:25:09.133]  How are you?
[03:25:09.133 --> 03:25:09.753]  I'm alright, brother.
[03:25:09.753 --> 03:25:10.794]  Alright.
[03:25:10.794 --> 03:25:13.276]  I just want to commend you so much for what you're doing.
[03:25:13.276 --> 03:25:15.598]  I don't even know where to begin.
[03:25:15.598 --> 03:25:17.960]  First of all, everything that happened in Boston,
[03:25:18.888 --> 03:25:19.869]  Thank you.
[03:25:19.869 --> 03:25:21.369]  It's not a surprise.
[03:25:21.369 --> 03:25:23.691]  It's happening here in Indiana.
[03:25:23.691 --> 03:25:28.554]  We can't even get you on the radio in Indiana anymore.
[03:25:28.554 --> 03:25:30.094]  I'm at Purdue University.
[03:25:30.094 --> 03:25:35.758]  Right after this yesterday, a bomb, they said there was a bomb on campus.
[03:25:35.758 --> 03:25:37.899]  All the guards came out, the SWAT team, everything.
[03:25:37.899 --> 03:25:39.540]  They brought robots out.
[03:25:39.540 --> 03:25:42.061]  They blasted it.
[03:25:42.061 --> 03:25:43.542]  It was a real windy day.
[03:25:43.542 --> 03:25:48.165]  It was an information flyer holder for a realtor in the street.
[03:25:49.355 --> 03:25:51.937]  They never told the school it was anything else.
[03:25:51.937 --> 03:25:53.799]  Kids are running around scared.
[03:25:53.799 --> 03:25:57.242]  And now they're high-fiving each other saying, we were victorious.
[03:25:57.242 --> 03:25:58.543]  We were ready for this.
[03:25:58.543 --> 03:25:59.864]  This is what we trained for.
[03:25:59.864 --> 03:26:00.744]  This is what we do.
[03:26:00.744 --> 03:26:02.046]  No, no, no.
[03:26:02.046 --> 03:26:04.067]  America doesn't manufacture things now.
[03:26:04.067 --> 03:26:08.731]  We give degrees to people to mind us and run our lives and boss us around.
[03:26:08.731 --> 03:26:14.096]  And young 20-year-old army officers now who are, you know, who are MPs walk over and go, light up.
[03:26:14.096 --> 03:26:15.036]  Give me your stuff.
[03:26:15.036 --> 03:26:17.098]  And your family goes, yes, sir.
[03:26:17.098 --> 03:26:17.678]  In you go.
[03:26:18.419 --> 03:26:21.401]  I mean, this is our servants taking us over.
[03:26:21.401 --> 03:26:27.684]  And of course, if they can blow up a few things and take our life over... Guys, put up the image of papers, please, here in America.
[03:26:27.684 --> 03:26:29.025]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[03:26:29.025 --> 03:26:31.066]  Snot-nosed kids come over to me and go, let me see your papers.
[03:26:31.066 --> 03:26:31.686]  I'm like, you know what?
[03:26:31.686 --> 03:26:32.887]  Go to hell.
[03:26:32.887 --> 03:26:35.589]  Your boss is Stage 9-11 and I'm sick of your crap.
[03:26:35.589 --> 03:26:37.289]  Jeremy, thank you.
[03:26:37.289 --> 03:26:39.090]  Noah and Tejas, you're on the air.
[03:26:39.090 --> 03:26:39.711]  Noah, go ahead.
[03:26:40.871 --> 03:26:41.892]  Yes, sir.
[03:26:41.892 --> 03:26:43.634]  I just wanted to tell you about Monday.
[03:26:43.634 --> 03:26:44.855]  I clicked on Drudge.
[03:26:44.855 --> 03:26:46.716]  He had a live feed.
[03:26:46.716 --> 03:26:51.361]  I clicked on Drudge's live feed to the coverage of the bombing.
[03:26:51.361 --> 03:26:59.328]  And when I clicked to it, they had on there somebody being interviewed named Chris Condon.
[03:27:00.487 --> 03:27:05.893]  And when he was being interviewed, he said, you can still get this feed.
[03:27:05.893 --> 03:27:12.860]  I don't know if you can go back and get the archives on Monday, but it was between 2.50 p.m.
[03:27:12.860 --> 03:27:16.063]  Central Time and about 3.10 Central Time.
[03:27:16.063 --> 03:27:18.546]  But he mentioned controlled explosions.
[03:27:18.726 --> 03:27:25.510]  Oh, no, no, we have news articles where they went, we had controlled explosions as part of the drill, and we have witnesses saying drill.
[03:27:25.510 --> 03:27:30.913]  No, no, they did that, and they go, that never happened, and the Boston Marathon never happened, but Santa Claus is real.
[03:27:30.913 --> 03:27:31.874]  Yeah, no, no, you're right.
[03:27:31.874 --> 03:27:33.195]  No, that's what I mean.
[03:27:33.195 --> 03:27:36.356]  I'm like, okay, controlled explosions, drills, you say there wasn't drills.
[03:27:36.356 --> 03:27:38.218]  Our reporter brings it up, there's no drill.
[03:27:38.218 --> 03:27:39.318]  There was a drill.
[03:27:39.318 --> 03:27:41.159]  Now we have the Navy SEALs and the troops.
[03:27:41.159 --> 03:27:42.180]  There was a drill.
[03:27:42.180 --> 03:27:43.240]  There was a drill.
[03:27:43.240 --> 03:27:44.241]  You're lying.
[03:27:44.241 --> 03:27:45.542]  I mean, we've got them, exactly.
[03:27:47.293 --> 03:27:48.614]  I hope you can get that.
[03:27:48.614 --> 03:27:49.534]  I couldn't get it.
[03:27:49.534 --> 03:27:50.775]  I didn't know how to go back.
[03:27:50.775 --> 03:27:52.476]  I'm not very savvy with my computer.
[03:27:52.476 --> 03:27:54.417]  I forget who Drudge linked to.
[03:27:54.417 --> 03:27:56.057]  He had a link to a local blog.
[03:27:56.057 --> 03:28:00.379]  It was Bloomberg TV or Bloomberg News.
[03:28:00.379 --> 03:28:03.201]  In other words, when you went to it, it said big letters.
[03:28:03.201 --> 03:28:04.281]  Bloomberg.
[03:28:04.281 --> 03:28:05.962]  Everyone needs to do this.
[03:28:05.962 --> 03:28:06.703]  I can't do everything.
[03:28:06.703 --> 03:28:07.583]  You can't do everything.
[03:28:07.583 --> 03:28:09.284]  Our millions of listeners need to go out.
[03:28:10.345 --> 03:28:14.869]  And we're going to cover news when we come back with the other host and then we're going to take your calls on ideas.
[03:28:14.869 --> 03:28:16.631]  Everyone needs to go out.
[03:28:16.631 --> 03:28:27.881]  Everyone needs to go to the two different TV feeds that are online of that day and watch them with a note and pad and then call them to shows, email the link, or if you have the capability, grab it, put it on YouTube.
[03:28:27.881 --> 03:28:30.383]  And listen, we're going to destroy them.
[03:28:30.383 --> 03:28:31.263]  They're smoking guns.
[03:28:31.263 --> 03:28:34.687]  There's probably the army handing the guys the bombs.
[03:28:35.627 --> 03:28:38.791]  You know, I mean, there's probably video of the guys, you know, detonating it.
[03:28:38.791 --> 03:28:40.954]  I mean, you know, we've got them.
[03:28:40.954 --> 03:28:45.539]  I mean, we already know they did a false flag, and they just think you're too lazy and too stupid to do it.
[03:28:45.539 --> 03:28:47.582]  So, defeat the enemy.
[03:28:47.582 --> 03:28:48.703]  Defeat the enemy.
[03:28:48.703 --> 03:28:49.484]  God bless you, Noah.
[03:28:49.484 --> 03:28:50.185]  Let's do one more.
[03:28:50.185 --> 03:28:52.328]  Tony in Florida, then my guest host are coming in.
[03:28:52.328 --> 03:28:53.129]  Tony, you're on the air.
[03:28:53.129 --> 03:28:54.931]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[03:28:55.795 --> 03:28:56.415]  History, man.
[03:28:56.415 --> 03:28:57.436]  History's happening right now.
[03:28:57.436 --> 03:28:58.336]  Yeah, I know.
[03:28:58.336 --> 03:29:01.337]  I just want to make a few comments about President Obama's speech this morning.
[03:29:01.337 --> 03:29:08.699]  You know, he gave a good recognition to the city of Boston, but he failed to make any mention on its revolutionary roots.
[03:29:08.699 --> 03:29:11.700]  You know, this is where our country was started.
[03:29:11.700 --> 03:29:17.402]  Patriots Day, I'm originally from Massachusetts, that's to memorize the Battle of Lexington and Concord.
[03:29:17.402 --> 03:29:21.503]  And that was the British coming to take our arms, and it's what we're seeing right now.
[03:29:23.240 --> 03:29:23.861]  You know, it's just amazing.
[03:29:23.861 --> 03:29:29.805]  Yeah, and they got a red coat openly saying he's a red coke and is conquering America on his Twitter pissing on us.
[03:29:29.805 --> 03:29:32.867]  I agree.
[03:29:32.867 --> 03:29:35.109]  Well, Piers Morgan's, you know, you want to fight, pal?
[03:29:35.109 --> 03:29:37.091]  You got one, you punk, snot-nosed bastard.
[03:29:38.117 --> 03:29:41.279]  You know, you come over here and urinate on me and my family, you're going to get it, punk.
[03:29:41.279 --> 03:29:45.641]  We're going to overrun you with info, send you back to England to face prison.
[03:29:45.641 --> 03:29:57.867]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back with Jakari Jackson, and David Knight, and your phone calls, and some other breaking news, and then more phone calls, and then the press conference with Obama in an hour and a half, or the FBI with their new passage.
[03:29:57.867 --> 03:29:59.188]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.188 --> 03:30:00.769]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:00.769 --> 03:30:02.590]  Spread this link to everybody.
[03:30:02.590 --> 03:30:06.412]  Spread the link to the live feed to everybody right now, and Google false flag.
[03:30:08.835 --> 03:30:10.256]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:10.256 --> 03:30:20.923]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:30:20.923 --> 03:30:28.128]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[03:30:28.128 --> 03:30:38.455]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next
[03:30:38.615 --> 03:30:39.376]  Level.
[03:30:39.376 --> 03:30:42.878]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:30:42.878 --> 03:30:49.022]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:30:49.022 --> 03:30:58.929]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:30:58.929 --> 03:31:00.430]  The war is here.
[03:31:00.430 --> 03:31:02.311]  It's an info war.
[03:31:02.311 --> 03:31:04.272]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:31:08.895 --> 03:31:10.456]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[03:31:10.456 --> 03:31:16.558]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[03:31:16.558 --> 03:31:24.761]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[03:31:24.761 --> 03:31:30.403]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.
[03:31:30.403 --> 03:31:32.624]  The E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[03:31:32.924 --> 03:31:42.972]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.
[03:31:42.972 --> 03:31:48.036]  To learn more and order your Bokashi online, visit Terragonics.com and click on the orange button.
[03:31:48.036 --> 03:31:53.241]  That's Terragonics.com, spelled T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[03:31:53.241 --> 03:31:53.701]  Or call 866-369-3678.
[03:31:53.701 --> 03:31:53.941]  That's 866-369-3678.
[03:32:00.146 --> 03:32:05.791]  Recycle all your food wastes in about six weeks with the Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.com.
[03:32:05.791 --> 03:32:06.752]  Terragonics.
[03:32:06.752 --> 03:32:08.514]  Life's getting better!
[03:32:08.514 --> 03:32:12.097]  In an emergency situation, would you drink contaminated water?
[03:32:12.097 --> 03:32:16.581]  You could if you had the amazing LifeStraw from MyPatriotsSupply.com.
[03:32:16.581 --> 03:32:20.304]  LifeStraw is the most advanced personal water filter available today.
[03:32:20.304 --> 03:32:22.946]  It filters contaminated water from almost any source.
[03:32:23.667 --> 03:32:23.947]  I think so.
[03:32:44.105 --> 03:32:45.025]  We're good to go.
[03:33:09.062 --> 03:33:11.804]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:33:11.804 --> 03:33:14.607]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:46.849 --> 03:33:48.350]  All right, and we are back.
[03:33:48.350 --> 03:33:50.132]  I'm Ja'kari Jackson filling in for Alex Jones.
[03:33:50.132 --> 03:33:51.633]  I'm here with David Knight.
[03:33:51.633 --> 03:33:52.614]  How are you doing today, David?
[03:33:52.614 --> 03:33:53.955]  Doing good, Ja'kari.
[03:33:53.955 --> 03:34:02.422]  Now, we have a new clip of Mrs. Napolitano being grilled about the Boston situation, about the Saudi national that's reportedly being deported.
[03:34:02.422 --> 03:34:04.724]  And guys, just let me know when you have that up and ready.
[03:34:04.724 --> 03:34:07.187]  But in the meantime, let's go through a few articles.
[03:34:07.187 --> 03:34:08.788]  David, what do you have right there?
[03:34:08.788 --> 03:34:10.830]  Well, we got a lot of interesting information.
[03:34:10.830 --> 03:34:13.832]  They're talking about this Rison suspect.
[03:34:15.204 --> 03:34:22.523]  The Washington Post put out an article earlier today painting him as a paranoid, conspiracist, Elvis impersonator.
[03:34:23.061 --> 03:34:23.922]  Yes, I saw that.
[03:34:23.922 --> 03:34:24.803]  I saw that.
[03:34:24.803 --> 03:34:33.250]  Well, it's just come out that the Gateway Pundit dug up some pictures of him, and he's actually a very strong Democrat activist.
[03:34:33.250 --> 03:34:41.377]  So, I don't know if they were trying to... It certainly sounded like WaPo was trying to make a profile that he was some kind of a Tea Party guy.
[03:34:41.377 --> 03:34:45.500]  Okay, I think we have that video ready, so we'll go to that, and then we'll come back and finish your thoughts.
[03:34:45.500 --> 03:34:46.421]  So, let's go to that video.
[03:34:47.034 --> 03:34:53.583]  I'm very concerned about this person of interest that was detained at the hospital in Boston following the Marathon Madness.
[03:34:53.583 --> 03:34:56.327]  He is, I believe, scheduled to be deported next week.
[03:34:56.327 --> 03:35:03.276]  And now I understand he's been cleared of any wrongdoing in the involvement in Boston, but he is being deported due to national security concerns.
[03:35:03.837 --> 03:35:04.978]  But CBS says this.
[03:35:04.978 --> 03:35:06.720]  This gentleman is here on a student visa.
[03:35:06.720 --> 03:35:10.002]  He was at the scene along with many other people when the blast happened.
[03:35:10.002 --> 03:35:15.247]  As everybody's standing in shock, three Boston PD detectives see this guy moving quickly out of the crowd.
[03:35:15.247 --> 03:35:21.051]  As they're watching him, he seems to be moving very deliberately, which could be a very natural thing after a bombing.
[03:35:21.051 --> 03:35:22.813]  They stop him because he's covered with blood.
[03:35:22.813 --> 03:35:23.914]  They end up taking the hospital.
[03:35:23.914 --> 03:35:25.135]  That's straight off CBS.
[03:35:26.236 --> 03:35:34.641]  And we're asking average Americans to help ID and assist law enforcement in identifying who the bomber was.
[03:35:34.641 --> 03:35:36.262]  See something, say something.
[03:35:36.262 --> 03:35:43.447]  And now we have someone who is being deported due to national security concerns, and I'm assuming that he's got some sort of link to terror or he wouldn't be being deported.
[03:35:43.447 --> 03:35:44.648]  He was at the scene.
[03:35:44.648 --> 03:35:52.974]  He could possibly ID the bomber, just like we're asking every other American that was on the scene to provide your pictures, help us identify who may have been acting funny.
[03:35:53.474 --> 03:35:58.081]  Everybody, we're asking that, that was in Boston, and we've got this guy who was there.
[03:35:58.081 --> 03:35:59.022]  We know he was there.
[03:35:59.022 --> 03:36:02.266]  He was arrested, or what arrested, was detained in the hospital, covered with blood.
[03:36:02.266 --> 03:36:05.331]  He was at the scene, and yet we're going to deport him.
[03:36:05.331 --> 03:36:07.193]  So we're going to remove him from the scene.
[03:36:08.835 --> 03:36:16.958]  I am unaware of anyone who is being deported for national security concerns at all related to Boston.
[03:36:16.958 --> 03:36:18.039]  I don't know where that rumor is from.
[03:36:18.039 --> 03:36:20.700]  I'm not saying it's related to Boston, but he is being deported.
[03:36:20.700 --> 03:36:29.523]  No, like I said, again, I don't even think he was technically a person of interest or a suspect.
[03:36:29.523 --> 03:36:30.604]  That was a wash.
[03:36:31.284 --> 03:36:33.985]  And I'm unaware of any proceeding there.
[03:36:33.985 --> 03:36:42.147]  I will clarify that for you, but I think this is an example of why it is so important to let law enforcement do its job.
[03:36:42.147 --> 03:36:55.612]  I want them to do their job, and that's why I say, wouldn't you agree with me that it's negligent for us as an American administration to deport someone who was reportedly at the scene of the bombing, and we're going to deport him not to be able to question him anymore?
[03:36:55.612 --> 03:36:56.592]  Is that not negligence?
[03:36:57.052 --> 03:36:58.413]  I'm not going to answer that question.
[03:36:58.413 --> 03:37:05.337]  It is so full of misstatements and misapprehensions that it's just not worthy of an answer.
[03:37:05.337 --> 03:37:07.218]  CBS reports the gentleman was there.
[03:37:07.218 --> 03:37:08.659]  We did detain him at the hospital.
[03:37:08.659 --> 03:37:09.840]  He was covered with blood.
[03:37:09.840 --> 03:37:14.222]  We've cleared him of any wrongdoing, but it has been reported he is being deported on charges.
[03:37:14.222 --> 03:37:17.084]  There's been so much reported on this that's been wrong.
[03:37:17.084 --> 03:37:20.126]  I can't even begin to tell you, Congressman.
[03:37:20.126 --> 03:37:23.928]  We will provide you with accurate information as it becomes available.
[03:37:23.928 --> 03:37:24.688]  I look forward to that.
[03:37:24.688 --> 03:37:24.949]  Thank you.
[03:37:24.949 --> 03:37:25.389]  I yield back.
[03:37:26.019 --> 03:37:30.763]  We will provide you with the accurate information as it becomes available.
[03:37:30.763 --> 03:37:32.044]  They control reality.
[03:37:32.044 --> 03:37:33.866]  Let's believe known liars!
[03:37:33.866 --> 03:37:38.269]  Just, they have the information, that's it, shut your piehole.
[03:37:38.269 --> 03:37:39.910]  And drugs has no credibility.
[03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:42.413]  No, Lynch, you have no credibility.
[03:37:42.413 --> 03:37:42.853]  Exactly.
[03:37:42.853 --> 03:37:47.377]  I mean, remember they used to say TSA does not grope your genitals when there was thousands of videos.
[03:37:47.377 --> 03:37:48.698]  They're a bunch of damn liars.
[03:37:49.394 --> 03:37:51.156]  Well, you notice what she's doing.
[03:37:51.156 --> 03:37:54.080]  It's a CBS report that Drudge linked to.
[03:37:54.080 --> 03:37:54.360]  Right.
[03:37:54.360 --> 03:37:58.165]  And so she tries to discredit it by saying, oh, it's coming from Drudge.
[03:37:58.165 --> 03:37:59.447]  He didn't write the content.
[03:37:59.447 --> 03:37:59.747]  No.
[03:37:59.747 --> 03:38:01.129]  CBS wrote the content.
[03:38:01.129 --> 03:38:06.236]  That's what the congressman kept trying to get her to understand, that CBS, CBS, CBS said this.
[03:38:06.536 --> 03:38:07.898]  But look at what they did yesterday.
[03:38:07.898 --> 03:38:12.683]  They were going to release the identity of the bomber, and then they didn't release the identity of the bomber.
[03:38:12.683 --> 03:38:13.684]  I thought they had them.
[03:38:13.684 --> 03:38:19.311]  I thought they had them, and then we released the information about these other guys at the Boston races.
[03:38:19.311 --> 03:38:21.573]  No, no, no, we're going to cancel the FBI press conference.
[03:38:21.573 --> 03:38:22.754]  Don't worry, she knows what's going on.
[03:38:22.754 --> 03:38:24.116]  But she has the information.
[03:38:24.116 --> 03:38:24.877]  She's the authority.
[03:38:24.957 --> 03:38:30.178]  She needs to go back and get married to Janet Reno, and they can sail off into the sunset and have children together.
[03:38:30.178 --> 03:38:31.918]  But they kidnap with CPS.
[03:38:31.918 --> 03:38:33.179]  Look how arrogant she is.
[03:38:33.179 --> 03:38:34.439]  They're scared, man.
[03:38:34.439 --> 03:38:35.559]  This is a confidence game.
[03:38:35.559 --> 03:38:37.260]  Hey, listen, you witch pig!
[03:38:37.260 --> 03:38:38.260]  We know what you did!
[03:38:38.260 --> 03:38:40.740]  Excuse me, I apologize for yelling in your ear.
[03:38:40.740 --> 03:38:41.180]  That's okay.
[03:38:41.180 --> 03:38:41.921]  Got any hearing?
[03:38:41.921 --> 03:38:44.321]  Got any hearing left?
[03:38:44.321 --> 03:38:46.602]  I love how we just leave these vitamins over here.
[03:38:46.602 --> 03:38:51.043]  Like when we're doing the shot, there's like this big pile of vitamins.
[03:38:51.043 --> 03:38:52.123]  Alright, I'm getting out of here.
[03:38:52.123 --> 03:38:52.803]  I'm getting out of here.
[03:38:53.767 --> 03:38:56.890]  All right, you are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:56.890 --> 03:39:00.514]  You can be watching this on Infowars.com forward slash listen.
[03:39:00.514 --> 03:39:03.096]  Okay, all right, we'll get to our calls.
[03:39:03.096 --> 03:39:04.378]  The press conference is coming up.
[03:39:04.378 --> 03:39:06.019]  We'll see what their new horse shit is.
[03:39:06.019 --> 03:39:08.822]  Network, get down.
[03:39:08.822 --> 03:39:11.605]  I haven't had enough sleep.
[03:39:11.605 --> 03:39:14.688]  Okay, there goes Alex Jones's bonus for the corner.
[03:39:16.545 --> 03:39:24.792]  Alright, yeah guys, tell me when we're up and ready for the calls and we'll get to those, but for right now, can we, we are ready?
[03:39:24.792 --> 03:39:26.433]  Let's take a look at the, oh no no.
[03:39:26.433 --> 03:39:30.176]  Well it certainly got under her skin and that congressman wasn't going to let her get away with it.
[03:39:30.176 --> 03:39:34.779]  And that was, everybody needs to take a look at that because it's worth it just to see how upset she got.
[03:39:34.779 --> 03:39:35.400]  Exactly.
[03:39:35.400 --> 03:39:38.422]  Should I help you concentrate like a big redneck eel?
[03:39:38.422 --> 03:39:41.144]  I just keep running in here and back out?
[03:39:41.144 --> 03:39:44.327]  Yeah, and then we can see him when he's outside.
[03:39:44.327 --> 03:39:45.368]  Now it's, can we pull up?
[03:39:46.658 --> 03:39:53.195]  Okay, we'll go to Danny in New York in just one second, but do we have that article so people can reference the Napolitano article?
[03:39:55.287 --> 03:39:57.248]  Okay, I guess the guys are pulling it up right now.
[03:39:57.248 --> 03:40:00.249]  Now, this article, there's also something on Drudge that's breaking right now.
[03:40:00.249 --> 03:40:10.413]  One of the people that was pictured and the photos that are going around on the internet has come forward and says, I'm not the Boston Marathon bomber.
[03:40:10.413 --> 03:40:12.894]  And so, that's a breaking article right now.
[03:40:12.894 --> 03:40:13.855]  You guys can get to that.
[03:40:13.855 --> 03:40:14.875]  That's a picture.
[03:40:14.875 --> 03:40:17.516]  Yeah, they got it on the iPad.
[03:40:17.516 --> 03:40:17.916]  Alex.
[03:40:17.916 --> 03:40:21.638]  Of all the photos we put out, they picked that to then divert off.
[03:40:21.638 --> 03:40:23.599]  And we're going to find out the new Patsy here in a few hours.
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:26.221]  Yeah, oh yeah, I'm sure we will.
[03:40:26.221 --> 03:40:28.602]  You guys just get out of the seat, I'm hosting, I'm joking.
[03:40:28.602 --> 03:40:30.123]  No, no, no, go ahead, I'm joking.
[03:40:30.123 --> 03:40:33.466]  Okay, we are ready for calls, right guys?
[03:40:33.466 --> 03:40:36.348]  Okay, Danny in New York, you are on the air.
[03:40:36.348 --> 03:40:39.250]  Yeah, hi, how are you doing guys?
[03:40:39.250 --> 03:40:41.071]  Very well, very well.
[03:40:41.071 --> 03:40:42.072]  Thanks.
[03:40:42.072 --> 03:40:43.873]  A couple of questions.
[03:40:43.873 --> 03:40:46.395]  With the hats and boots that the
[03:40:47.662 --> 03:41:10.508]  Uh guys in the pictures are wearing um you can get those at craft uh store like uh they have like some kind of thing where you can buy the hats and all the gear and it donates toward uh some foundation so uh I guess my question with that is if it's an you know if it's really an inside job are they trying to hide in plain sight or do you think this could be
[03:41:11.520 --> 03:41:15.421]  If it has any validity to being an actual group, could they be trying to hide?
[03:41:15.421 --> 03:41:16.462]  That's a great point!
[03:41:16.462 --> 03:41:19.183]  We should call Kraft International and ask if they were there.
[03:41:19.183 --> 03:41:20.663]  I'm gonna go do it right now.
[03:41:20.663 --> 03:41:22.864]  Okay, Alex Jones is on the case right now.
[03:41:22.864 --> 03:41:31.307]  And as far as the hats and the boots the gentleman was referring to, I mean, the actual logo, that skull logo, is from a comic book character, the Punisher.
[03:41:31.307 --> 03:41:33.727]  You can buy those t-shirts anywhere.
[03:41:33.727 --> 03:41:35.348]  But it is a valid point.
[03:41:35.348 --> 03:41:36.848]  You can buy those at different places.
[03:41:36.848 --> 03:41:38.529]  But Alex Jones, like you said, is on the case.
[03:41:38.789 --> 03:41:44.932]  As we also showed, though, in the pictures, SEAL teams have adopted that same Punisher logo.
[03:41:44.932 --> 03:41:53.017]  And you can look at the picture, it looks like there's something up on the forehead of it, kind of like it is with the SEAL Team 3, I think it is.
[03:41:53.017 --> 03:41:59.200]  But, yeah, it's also the demeanor of the guys, and the fact that they're standing right next to each other.
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:00.821]  They both have earpieces in.
[03:42:00.821 --> 03:42:02.141]  They're definitely together.
[03:42:02.141 --> 03:42:03.522]  Yeah, they're both on cell phones.
[03:42:05.203 --> 03:42:07.784]  Both dressed exactly alike with the pants and the shoes.
[03:42:07.784 --> 03:42:12.044]  I mean, I don't necessarily think that it's just a coincidence that they went shopping together.
[03:42:12.044 --> 03:42:13.065]  Right.
[03:42:13.065 --> 03:42:14.485]  I mean, it is Austin.
[03:42:14.485 --> 03:42:15.345]  They're besties.
[03:42:15.345 --> 03:42:24.347]  I mean, they don't look like they're constituents of Barney Frank.
[03:42:24.347 --> 03:42:28.408]  Yeah, but that's a very good point, Collin, and like I said, Alex is on the case.
[03:42:28.408 --> 03:42:32.949]  We'll move now to Jim in Texas.
[03:42:32.949 --> 03:42:34.109]  How are you?
[03:42:34.109 --> 03:42:34.689]  Doing very well.
[03:42:36.386 --> 03:42:37.547]  I'm in law enforcement.
[03:42:37.547 --> 03:42:46.712]  I really don't want to go into, um, where I work, but, uh, I just want to say to folks that are out there in law enforcement, it's time to get off your asses.
[03:42:46.712 --> 03:42:50.334]  And, um, what's going on right now is real.
[03:42:50.334 --> 03:42:52.095]  It's not fake.
[03:42:52.095 --> 03:42:59.759]  I think a lot of people out there, um, are really scared, but, uh, we didn't gain our freedom by being scared.
[03:42:59.759 --> 03:43:03.401]  And, um, I just want you guys to know there's a lot of people out here that do know what are going on.
[03:43:04.235 --> 03:43:07.177]  And we're aware, and we listen daily.
[03:43:07.177 --> 03:43:09.339]  Okay, now let me ask you this, Jim.
[03:43:09.339 --> 03:43:11.881]  You know, you say you want people to get off the fence.
[03:43:11.881 --> 03:43:19.467]  What would you recommend to an officer, you know, who maybe he sees things going on, but he's afraid to, you know, talk about it or share the information?
[03:43:19.467 --> 03:43:29.394]  Well, I just think that people need to understand that there are such things as lawful orders and unlawful orders, and we still live under the Constitution in the United States.
[03:43:29.394 --> 03:43:32.497]  I just don't understand how we can have people that take an oath
[03:43:33.717 --> 03:43:39.259]  To defend the Constitution in our country and go every day about trying to tear it apart.
[03:43:39.259 --> 03:43:40.480]  I don't understand this, you know?
[03:43:40.480 --> 03:43:41.140]  Absolutely.
[03:43:41.140 --> 03:43:42.101]  And nobody's waking up.
[03:43:42.101 --> 03:43:44.742]  It's, uh, you know, you take it all for a reason.
[03:43:44.742 --> 03:43:47.523]  You become, you know, you do your job.
[03:43:47.523 --> 03:43:50.084]  I've been doing this 21 years combined.
[03:43:50.084 --> 03:43:52.965]  And, um, it's pretty sad.
[03:43:52.965 --> 03:43:58.268]  Um, it's sad for me to see people that are out there that just basically understand what's going on.
[03:43:58.268 --> 03:44:00.209]  They're quiet because they're scared and it's understandable.
[03:44:01.550 --> 03:44:03.171]  If you're going to be scared, you're going to lose your rights.
[03:44:03.171 --> 03:44:04.452]  And that's just what it comes down to.
[03:44:04.452 --> 03:44:06.354]  So I just want to thank you guys.
[03:44:06.354 --> 03:44:07.855]  I listen to you daily.
[03:44:07.855 --> 03:44:09.256]  I respect what you do.
[03:44:09.256 --> 03:44:10.197]  You're the real deal.
[03:44:10.197 --> 03:44:12.278]  I don't care what anyone thinks out there.
[03:44:12.278 --> 03:44:13.319]  Go back and do the research.
[03:44:13.319 --> 03:44:14.720]  If you don't believe it, Google it.
[03:44:14.720 --> 03:44:15.420]  Look it up yourself.
[03:44:15.420 --> 03:44:17.162]  There's plenty of places to find it.
[03:44:17.162 --> 03:44:18.863]  If you want to know, you'll find it.
[03:44:18.863 --> 03:44:19.323]  Exactly.
[03:44:19.323 --> 03:44:20.504]  Well, thanks for making that point.
[03:44:20.504 --> 03:44:25.148]  You know, it was coming up to just about two weeks ago, two Saturdays ago.
[03:44:27.472 --> 03:44:30.873]  And Jakari and I went to this gun rally, anti-gun rally.
[03:44:30.873 --> 03:44:32.054]  Moms Demand Action.
[03:44:32.054 --> 03:44:33.374]  Yeah, in Austin.
[03:44:33.374 --> 03:44:35.615]  And they had the Austin police chief there.
[03:44:35.615 --> 03:44:36.716]  And I was surprised.
[03:44:36.716 --> 03:44:47.319]  Now this is a guy who went immediately after that meeting, he went up to Washington, he was meeting with Joe Biden and a lot of other police chiefs who were trying to take away gun rights.
[03:44:47.319 --> 03:44:50.601]  And so he's very much hooked into that gun control crowd.
[03:44:50.601 --> 03:44:56.063]  And I was surprised to see him actually take on very strongly constitutional sheriffs.
[03:44:57.222 --> 03:45:16.668]  And what he was putting forth was essentially not a division of power that we have in the Constitution, not rights that are reserved to states and rights that are reserved to sheriffs as we see in the Constitution, but what he was trying to put forth was a very rigid hierarchy with a federal government at the top
[03:45:17.208 --> 03:45:25.411]  And the Supreme Court at the very top of that, basically saying, well, if the Supreme Court says that the Second Amendment doesn't have any meaning, then you better do what it says.
[03:45:25.411 --> 03:45:30.573]  You're going to enforce the laws as they are passed, no matter how unconstitutional they may be.
[03:45:30.573 --> 03:45:31.133]  That's right.
[03:45:31.133 --> 03:45:42.417]  What he was saying is, you know, that the legislature passes the laws, the Supreme Court decides if they're constitutional, and then the executive branch, which you and law enforcement are part of, you execute that.
[03:45:42.417 --> 03:45:43.137]  That's not true.
[03:45:43.857 --> 03:46:00.946]  You have a division of power between even those three federal branches and there's a division of power between the federal government and the states and between those two entities and the people and he's trying to criticize sheriffs who are elected officials and these police chiefs are not elected officials.
[03:46:01.306 --> 03:46:09.836]  So those battle lines are being drawn and that's something that's going to be coming down the pipe because this is somebody that's very hooked in to the Democrat hierarchy that's coming after gun control.
[03:46:09.836 --> 03:46:14.662]  They are going to get aggressive in terms of criticizing sheriffs and we're going to be there defending them.
[03:46:14.662 --> 03:46:17.285]  Right, and it's like a whole clique here in Austin.
[03:46:18.246 --> 03:46:33.938]  The police chief and the mayor and the councilman it's like the whole clique in the in the heart of Texas I guess you would say because I see so many comments and people are well thank God I live in Texas where we where we have common sense like these people trying to take away your gun just like the people in New York, the people in California.
[03:46:33.938 --> 03:46:36.320]  They just banned plastic bags here in Austin.
[03:46:36.320 --> 03:46:37.421]  Yeah.
[03:46:37.421 --> 03:46:39.262]  This is like Bloomberg wannabes.
[03:46:39.262 --> 03:46:40.203]  I mean yeah.
[03:46:40.203 --> 03:46:42.285]  I say screw your bag ban you know.
[03:46:42.925 --> 03:46:44.166]  I make those people so mad.
[03:46:44.166 --> 03:46:45.507]  Like, we can't get plastic bags.
[03:46:45.507 --> 03:46:47.709]  We'll go to our next caller in just one second.
[03:46:47.709 --> 03:46:50.510]  But we can't get plastic bags here in the city of Austin anymore.
[03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:57.555]  So what I do is I get my grocery cart and I go to the checkout line with all my stuff and then like, sir, do you want to purchase a bag?
[03:46:57.555 --> 03:46:59.557]  I say, no, put everything back in the cart.
[03:46:59.557 --> 03:47:00.477]  And they're like, what?
[03:47:00.477 --> 03:47:04.580]  And then I roll it outside and I have this big bin in my trunk and I put all my stuff in.
[03:47:04.580 --> 03:47:06.101]  So that's how you defeat the bag.
[03:47:06.101 --> 03:47:08.603]  Because you can still get bags, you just have to pay for them now.
[03:47:09.924 --> 03:47:12.165]  I mean, you can go buy as many plastic bags as you want.
[03:47:12.165 --> 03:47:13.046]  They just want you to pay for them.
[03:47:13.046 --> 03:47:13.866]  That's what it is.
[03:47:13.866 --> 03:47:14.346]  Yeah.
[03:47:14.346 --> 03:47:14.486]  Yeah.
[03:47:14.486 --> 03:47:16.267]  All right, we'll move on to the next call.
[03:47:16.267 --> 03:47:21.330]  We have Tom in Missouri.
[03:47:21.330 --> 03:47:23.411]  Hello, Tom.
[03:47:23.411 --> 03:47:24.251]  Hey, sir.
[03:47:24.251 --> 03:47:28.974]  Hey, listen, I'm a first-time caller, a member of Prison Planet, a longtime listener.
[03:47:28.974 --> 03:47:30.214]  I'm a retired military.
[03:47:30.214 --> 03:47:33.096]  Kudos to Alex, but the crew doesn't get enough.
[03:47:34.150 --> 03:47:34.710]  Compliments.
[03:47:34.710 --> 03:47:36.371]  You guys are doing a fantastic job.
[03:47:36.371 --> 03:47:38.093]  Especially the guys behind the camera.
[03:47:38.093 --> 03:47:42.735]  The radio guys have been working some serious hours just this past week.
[03:47:42.735 --> 03:47:45.677]  I could only imagine the things you guys go through to get this out.
[03:47:45.677 --> 03:47:57.705]  But anyway, based on what the request was calling in about what you think is going on, the bombing, I think that it's just a diversion.
[03:47:57.705 --> 03:47:59.666]  I do think it's a false flag.
[03:47:59.666 --> 03:48:02.428]  And I believe that they have many, many more events planned.
[03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:08.578]  It wouldn't surprise me if they had something to do with this factory exploding in Texas and the ricin.
[03:48:18.837 --> 03:48:23.161]  Probably, you know, a hundred other things that they've got already set up that they can put in effect.
[03:48:23.161 --> 03:48:36.312]  Yeah, and speaking of the Ryerson, sir, not to cut you off, but we'd had that interview where Alex did the interview with John McAfee back in January and McAfee said he had, you know, tips that they were making a good amount of Ryerson.
[03:48:36.312 --> 03:48:36.973]  Here's Alex.
[03:48:36.973 --> 03:48:38.254]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[03:48:38.254 --> 03:48:42.597]  I'm like salacious crumb sitting on your shoulder here.
[03:48:42.597 --> 03:48:45.000]  I'm glad you mentioned that because
[03:48:45.680 --> 03:48:48.142]  An Elvis impersonator, Democratic Party guy?
[03:48:48.142 --> 03:48:50.024]  That's a cut out.
[03:48:50.024 --> 03:48:51.485]  That's just like some cover.
[03:48:51.485 --> 03:48:55.308]  Oh, this guy, the Elvis impersonator sent to Ryerson.
[03:48:55.308 --> 03:48:57.269]  I mean, give me a break, man.
[03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:59.151]  Give me a break.
[03:48:59.151 --> 03:49:00.532]  Yeah.
[03:49:00.532 --> 03:49:03.154]  Anyway, you can find that interview with John McAfee.
[03:49:03.154 --> 03:49:04.635]  I believe it has been reposted.
[03:49:04.635 --> 03:49:07.197]  But if you are a Prison Planet member, you can also find it.
[03:49:07.197 --> 03:49:09.159]  I believe it was January 4th of this year.
[03:49:09.159 --> 03:49:10.119]  We have to move quick, Tom.
[03:49:10.119 --> 03:49:11.160]  Thank you for your call.
[03:49:11.160 --> 03:49:13.042]  We'll move now to Dylan in Utah.
[03:49:17.210 --> 03:49:19.271]  Hello, Dylan.
[03:49:19.271 --> 03:49:20.072]  Hello.
[03:49:20.072 --> 03:49:21.592]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:49:21.592 --> 03:49:25.354]  Oh, hey, um, just want to say thanks for everything you guys are doing.
[03:49:25.354 --> 03:49:34.359]  I don't know if you guys had already covered it, but Yahoo is headlining President Obama's reaction, respond to the defeated gun bill.
[03:49:34.359 --> 03:49:36.361]  Yeah, I printed out some articles, but go ahead.
[03:49:36.361 --> 03:49:37.081]  I'll see if I can find it.
[03:49:38.627 --> 03:49:41.068]  I just wanted to say that it is a small victory.
[03:49:41.068 --> 03:49:46.191]  I know it's not over, but people need to know that InfoWars is making a difference.
[03:49:46.191 --> 03:49:52.933]  There's a lot of people out there that say that it doesn't really do much of anything to talk about it, but it's clearly getting through.
[03:49:52.933 --> 03:49:54.194]  He does make a
[03:49:55.192 --> 03:49:59.798]  A really silly point saying that 90% of Americans supported that legislation.
[03:49:59.798 --> 03:50:01.820]  Yes, where did they get these numbers from?
[03:50:01.820 --> 03:50:04.443]  Because they say the same thing when we go to these anti-gun rallies.
[03:50:04.443 --> 03:50:11.811]  Most Americans, and they'll say, you know, usually they'll lowball, they won't say 90% like Obama does, but they'll say like 60 plus percent of Americans.
[03:50:12.512 --> 03:50:12.972]  I don't know.
[03:50:29.187 --> 03:50:31.249]  Background checks will happen.
[03:50:31.249 --> 03:50:32.830]  He added minutes after the vote.
[03:50:32.830 --> 03:50:35.452]  This outcome is a delay, not a defeat.
[03:50:35.452 --> 03:50:36.954]  And that's the same thing for us.
[03:50:36.954 --> 03:50:39.095]  It's just they're delaying their next move.
[03:50:39.095 --> 03:50:40.937]  We have to keep going after these people.
[03:50:40.937 --> 03:50:42.218]  So just enjoy it for the time.
[03:50:42.218 --> 03:50:44.019]  We need to get off of the defense.
[03:50:44.019 --> 03:50:45.721]  And we need to start playing offense.
[03:50:45.721 --> 03:50:46.041]  Exactly.
[03:50:46.041 --> 03:50:48.863]  We need to say we won this round, but we're going to take back that right.
[03:50:48.863 --> 03:50:49.024]  Exactly.
[03:50:49.024 --> 03:50:51.666]  We have to go to break and we'll come back with Dylan in Utah.
[03:51:08.874 --> 03:51:10.816]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[03:51:10.816 --> 03:51:13.217]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[03:51:13.217 --> 03:51:18.641]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[03:51:18.641 --> 03:51:22.684]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[03:51:22.684 --> 03:51:26.567]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[03:51:26.567 --> 03:51:27.948]  The fact is, you are.
[03:51:27.948 --> 03:51:28.969]  We all are.
[03:51:28.969 --> 03:51:31.291]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[03:51:31.591 --> 03:51:40.076]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[03:51:40.076 --> 03:51:41.457]  Be prepared before you need it.

[03:54:16.351 --> 03:54:25.816]  Alright, we're coming back and we were just talking to Dylan in Utah and he was telling us that he believed that the press and the coverage had really made a difference on the Second Amendment fight.
[03:54:25.816 --> 03:54:27.617]  I believe it did too.
[03:54:27.617 --> 03:54:32.560]  And what we need to look at is though, we've still got a fight going on with CISPA.
[03:54:32.560 --> 03:54:34.221]  And that's going on right now.
[03:54:34.221 --> 03:54:38.403]  And I tell you folks, Republican House voted on that by a large margin.
[03:54:39.063 --> 03:54:49.896]  But we can still defeat this thing and it is something that if they're going to be able to violate your Fourth Amendment rights in the virtual sphere, they're going to do it in the physical sphere as well.
[03:54:49.896 --> 03:54:56.903]  We've already seen it at the airport when we know that the whole purpose of this false flag attack is to get TSA out of the airports and out of the streets.
[03:54:56.903 --> 03:54:58.966]  So we need to start fighting this CISPA thing.
[03:54:59.366 --> 03:55:00.007]  We're good to go.
[03:55:16.224 --> 03:55:16.945]  Exactly.
[03:55:16.945 --> 03:55:24.250]  Now I want all of our viewers to know we only have about five minutes left in this segment because at three o'clock central we will be switching to our other phone lines.
[03:55:24.250 --> 03:55:28.914]  So I do apologize, I'm sure we won't get to everybody in our current call list, but you can call right now 877-789-ALEX.
[03:55:28.914 --> 03:55:32.957]  That is 877-789-2539 and we will be switching to that phone number at three o'clock central time.
[03:55:32.957 --> 03:55:35.198]  So we're going to try to go very quickly.
[03:55:35.198 --> 03:55:36.139]  Dylan, you are on the air.
[03:55:44.079 --> 03:55:57.992]  Yeah, I'm just going to make it short and then get off the line to free up the line here, but also I wanted to let everybody know that, you know, you've got to understand that Alex Jones doesn't just pull all the stuff from his rear end.
[03:55:57.992 --> 03:55:59.814]  I mean, he gives you the tools.
[03:55:59.814 --> 03:56:02.116]  He gives you all the evidence you need.
[03:56:02.116 --> 03:56:06.540]  A lot of these other media sources, they don't do that.
[03:56:06.540 --> 03:56:08.042]  They don't give you the sources.
[03:56:08.530 --> 03:56:17.632]  So before you start arguing that, you know, Alex is a shill, he's a, you know, this and that, he's a misinformation, you know, agent.
[03:56:17.632 --> 03:56:19.152]  He provides everything there.
[03:56:19.152 --> 03:56:20.952]  You just need to look into it.
[03:56:20.952 --> 03:56:24.913]  And I just wanted to say I appreciate and love you guys.
[03:56:24.913 --> 03:56:25.113]  All right.
[03:56:25.113 --> 03:56:25.593]  Thank you Dylan.
[03:56:25.593 --> 03:56:26.994]  We'll have to jump quick.
[03:56:26.994 --> 03:56:28.054]  Zach in Kentucky.
[03:56:28.054 --> 03:56:34.115]  My question is you guys with the Boston Marathon attack.
[03:56:35.066 --> 03:56:43.832]  What do you guys see happening for other sporting events or other large population events coming up now all across the country?
[03:57:05.106 --> 03:57:08.789]  Well, they already mentioned that they're going to start cracking down on all the sporting events.
[03:57:08.789 --> 03:57:11.430]  That was on SportsCenter the other day.
[03:57:11.430 --> 03:57:14.772]  The guys were talking about Janet Napolitano says we need to have more security at these events.
[03:57:14.772 --> 03:57:15.133]  Go ahead, David.
[03:57:15.133 --> 03:57:17.674]  Well, they went to the sporting events first, if you recall.
[03:57:17.674 --> 03:57:21.877]  I mean, it's at the football games that you'd see TSA coming out.
[03:57:21.877 --> 03:57:25.540]  And Alex has talked about that many times, about how they would do that.
[03:57:25.540 --> 03:57:31.964]  And of course, we saw on the Dark Knight, you know, they have the very striking visual of the football stadium that's being exploded and that sort of thing.
[03:57:31.964 --> 03:57:34.726]  So they've been coming at the sports events.
[03:57:35.526 --> 03:57:35.747]  Yeah, hi.
[03:57:35.747 --> 03:57:38.949]  I was calling about the guy you have a picture of that's carrying the radiation detector.
[03:57:38.949 --> 03:57:39.089]  Yes, sir.
[03:58:01.644 --> 03:58:06.426]  Yeah, he went on Wolf Blitzer and his name is Dr. David King.
[03:58:06.426 --> 03:58:19.890]  If you go to, uh, let's see here, the Situation Room for yesterday, about 635 Eastern Time, he was on there with him and he claims that he left the race before the explosion.
[03:58:19.890 --> 03:58:22.531]  Situation, can you repeat how we can find that again?
[03:58:22.531 --> 03:58:24.251]  Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.
[03:58:24.251 --> 03:58:27.953]  Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer and type in Dr. David King.
[03:58:27.953 --> 03:58:28.753]  Okay.
[03:58:29.525 --> 03:58:29.925]  Okay.
[03:58:29.925 --> 03:58:30.145]  All right.
[03:58:30.145 --> 03:58:30.905]  We'll investigate.
[03:58:30.905 --> 03:58:31.105]  All right.
[03:58:31.105 --> 03:58:32.386]  Thank you for your call, sir.
[03:58:32.386 --> 03:58:35.187]  I'm sorry to Nelson and Ron, but also you can call 877-789-ALEX.
[03:58:35.187 --> 03:58:35.627]  That is 877-789-ALEX.
[03:58:35.627 --> 03:58:36.867]  We'll be back after this break.
[03:58:36.867 --> 03:58:37.867]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:37.867 --> 03:58:38.888]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:58.911 --> 03:59:00.812]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:59:00.812 --> 03:59:04.454]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[03:59:04.454 --> 03:59:09.016]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:59:09.016 --> 03:59:15.119]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[03:59:15.119 --> 03:59:25.884]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[03:59:26.084 --> 03:59:32.590]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[03:59:32.590 --> 03:59:47.323]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[03:59:47.503 --> 03:59:50.464]  You're listening to GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
[04:00:16.678 --> 04:00:25.189]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[04:00:31.528 --> 04:00:33.870]  Alright, and welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[04:00:33.870 --> 04:00:37.513]  We are in heavy overdrive, myself and David Knight hosting.
[04:00:37.513 --> 04:00:40.916]  You can call us at 877-789-ALEX.
[04:00:40.916 --> 04:00:43.258]  That is 877-789-2539.
[04:00:43.258 --> 04:00:50.664]  We will be taking more calls pretty much this whole hour, but we do have a few clips we want to throw to you in the meantime.
[04:00:50.664 --> 04:00:52.846]  Do we have that Harry Reid clip ready, guys?
[04:00:56.188 --> 04:00:58.409]  Okay, the guys are getting ready for their eclipse.
[04:00:58.409 --> 04:01:03.873]  So if we have anybody on call, you can give us a call and we can put those on the board.
[04:01:03.873 --> 04:01:06.775]  But in the meantime, David Knight, what are you looking at right there?
[04:01:06.775 --> 04:01:16.883]  Well, we just had a caller just before we went to the top of the hour telling us that the guy holding the device, I guess, was a radiation detector and that his name was Dr. David King.
[04:01:16.883 --> 04:01:18.684]  He's on the Wolf Blitzer Situation Room yesterday.
[04:01:18.684 --> 04:01:19.985]  I just looked that up.
[04:01:19.985 --> 04:01:23.428]  I haven't seen the video yet, but the subtitle to it says that he was a surgeon.
[04:01:24.569 --> 04:01:27.130]  And that he'd finish running the Boston Marathon.
[04:01:27.130 --> 04:01:29.432]  Maybe that's not the picture I'm thinking of.
[04:01:29.432 --> 04:01:32.813]  So we'll have to still take a look at that, but we don't have anything conclusive on that yet.
[04:01:32.813 --> 04:01:35.595]  But we're going to be having a press conference coming up at 4 p.m.
[04:01:35.595 --> 04:01:39.016]  and we're going to be commenting on that, so guys, stick around.
[04:01:39.016 --> 04:01:43.259]  Okay, and we are ready with that video, so let's take a look at that right now.
[04:01:43.259 --> 04:01:45.159]  We can keep them off the streets.
[04:01:45.159 --> 04:01:48.101]  We should keep them off the streets.
[04:01:48.101 --> 04:01:51.963]  In the 1920s, organized crime was committing murders with machine guns.
[04:01:51.963 --> 04:01:53.924]  We've seen them in the movies.
[04:01:55.165 --> 04:01:58.468]  Valentine's Day Massacre.
[04:01:58.468 --> 04:02:03.352]  So, Congress dramatically limited the sale and transfer of machine guns.
[04:02:03.352 --> 04:02:06.594]  Long time ago.
[04:02:06.594 --> 04:02:10.457]  As a result, machine guns basically disappeared from the streets.
[04:02:10.457 --> 04:02:11.218]  No, it didn't.
[04:02:11.218 --> 04:02:12.639]  They're in movies.
[04:02:12.639 --> 04:02:16.522]  But not private citizens have them.
[04:02:16.522 --> 04:02:23.067]  We can and should make the same common sense approach to safeguard Americans from modern weapons of war.
[04:02:23.067 --> 04:02:23.748]  Assault weapons.
[04:02:24.946 --> 04:02:30.469]  That's why I will vote for Dianne Feinstein's assault weapons ban.
[04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:40.575]  Because we must strike a better balance between the right to defend ourselves and the right of every child in America to grow up safe from gun violence.
[04:02:40.575 --> 04:02:50.121]  I'll vote for the ban because maintaining a law and order is more important than satisfying conspiracy theories who believe in black helicopters and false flags.
[04:02:50.121 --> 04:02:52.342]  I'm going to find that black helicopter clip.
[04:02:53.459 --> 04:03:04.687]  And I'll vote for the ban because saving the lives of police officers, young and old, and innocent civilians, young and old, is more important than preventing imagined tyranny.
[04:03:04.687 --> 04:03:05.848]  Imagined tyranny?
[04:03:05.848 --> 04:03:07.949]  So, high-capacity magazines.
[04:03:07.949 --> 04:03:09.590]  Clips.
[04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:11.792]  That's what I call them.
[04:03:11.792 --> 04:03:13.433]  That's because you don't know what you're talking about.
[04:03:13.433 --> 04:03:17.255]  My view of the ban on large-dimension magazines is similar.
[04:03:17.255 --> 04:03:19.257]  These large clips are designed to kill.
[04:03:21.428 --> 04:03:21.929]  We're good to go.
[04:03:33.160 --> 04:03:33.840]  Okay, guys.
[04:03:33.840 --> 04:03:35.181]  Where do you start?
[04:03:35.181 --> 04:03:37.041]  Hold that thought, David Knight.
[04:03:37.041 --> 04:03:40.422]  Let's give some directions to the guys out there.
[04:03:40.422 --> 04:03:41.362]  I know I'm pulling to Alex here.
[04:03:41.362 --> 04:03:43.303]  Can you guys go into the show?
[04:03:43.303 --> 04:03:46.303]  The nightly news for last week is probably Thursday or Friday.
[04:03:46.303 --> 04:03:47.644]  I think it was Friday.
[04:03:47.644 --> 04:03:50.684]  And there's a clip called Black Helicopter Crowd.
[04:03:50.684 --> 04:03:55.066]  It's me talking about Joe Biden and how he says, you know, the black helicopter crowd.
[04:03:55.066 --> 04:03:56.346]  There are no black helicopters.
[04:03:56.346 --> 04:04:00.627]  And David Knight, right here, did a very long in-depth report
[04:04:01.307 --> 04:04:02.349]  About black helicopters.
[04:04:02.349 --> 04:04:04.352]  Mine's only about two or three minutes, so if we can find that.
[04:04:04.352 --> 04:04:06.815]  But David Knight, you seem like you have something to say about that.
[04:04:06.815 --> 04:04:07.656]  Man, I don't know.
[04:04:07.656 --> 04:04:10.200]  There's so much garbage that came out of there.
[04:04:10.200 --> 04:04:14.305]  I mean, you know, even going back to the term assault rifle.
[04:04:14.305 --> 04:04:17.590]  Okay, you know, that's a vague, undefined term.
[04:04:18.090 --> 04:04:22.632]  But, uh, and his confusion of clips and that sort of thing, and the fact that clips are designed to kill.
[04:04:22.632 --> 04:04:25.873]  You know, I mean... Well, aren't bullets designed to take down the target?
[04:04:25.873 --> 04:04:26.613]  That's right.
[04:04:26.613 --> 04:04:28.533]  But, let's start with the very first thing he said.
[04:04:28.533 --> 04:04:32.135]  You know, that they got rid of machine guns because of a law that they passed.
[04:04:32.135 --> 04:04:37.716]  No, the reason people were shooting each other on the streets in the 1920s was because of alcohol prohibition.
[04:04:37.716 --> 04:04:39.437]  Bro, Jason, they don't want to talk about that.
[04:04:39.437 --> 04:04:42.458]  And 80% of the gun violence, according to the Chicago Chief of Police,
[04:04:43.058 --> 04:04:48.306]  Is because of drug gangs shooting it out with each other, just like Al Capone did.
[04:04:48.306 --> 04:04:56.397]  And the reason you got people that, you know, they can do all the bans that they want to on machine guns, but that didn't stop Al Capone.
[04:04:56.397 --> 04:04:57.819]  He didn't care that it banned alcohol.
[04:04:58.380 --> 04:05:04.322]  No, I didn't care if they're going to ban machine guns and, you know, pretty boy Floyd and these guys are going to rob banks of the machine guns or whatever.
[04:05:04.322 --> 04:05:09.204]  But, you know, the bottom line is it was prohibition that was causing the crime there.
[04:05:09.204 --> 04:05:12.845]  And it's prohibition that is responsible for things being shot up on the street.
[04:05:12.845 --> 04:05:18.307]  And government will always make another mistake before they correct the original problem.
[04:05:18.687 --> 04:05:22.909]  And that's what we see here with this attempt to try to destroy the Second Amendment.
[04:05:22.909 --> 04:05:25.089]  And it is not an imagined tyranny.
[04:05:25.089 --> 04:05:31.311]  The Second Amendment in our Constitution was written because our founders had experienced a tyranny.
[04:05:31.311 --> 04:05:35.413]  And they wrote the Constitution, put safeguards in there to keep that from happening again.
[04:05:36.153 --> 04:05:39.077]  And that's why we have it there.
[04:05:39.077 --> 04:05:43.101]  They had come for the guns at Lexington and Concord and that started the American Revolution.
[04:05:43.101 --> 04:05:44.503]  They did it here in Texas.
[04:05:44.503 --> 04:05:46.625]  That started the Texas Revolution.
[04:05:46.625 --> 04:05:53.873]  You don't take away people's right to protect themselves and to exercise a check on the power of government.
[04:05:53.873 --> 04:05:55.015]  And that's a peaceful check.
[04:05:55.575 --> 04:06:06.463]  As long as the citizens have weapons and the government knows that, it's like two countries that are well armed and in a strong position and one's not going to initiate a war against the other one.
[04:06:06.463 --> 04:06:07.744]  It's that kind of a check.
[04:06:07.744 --> 04:06:11.507]  It's really a better chance for peace than if you're unilaterally disarmed.
[04:06:11.755 --> 04:06:21.017]  Yeah, like I said, it was on the nightly news a couple nights ago, if we want to, if we use the same logic and we say we don't want the threat of nuclear war, let's just declare the U.S.
[04:06:21.017 --> 04:06:22.197]  a nuke-free zone.
[04:06:22.197 --> 04:06:23.637]  Right, absolutely.
[04:06:23.637 --> 04:06:27.838]  We don't have anything to shoot back at you, North Korea, so yeah, just, they'll leave us alone now.
[04:06:27.838 --> 04:06:33.539]  Let's go to our calls to Jordan in California.
[04:06:33.539 --> 04:06:35.500]  Hello, Jordan.
[04:06:35.500 --> 04:06:38.140]  My cousin just called me less than an hour ago.
[04:06:38.140 --> 04:06:40.741]  There has been a bomb threat at Cal State Los Angeles.
[04:06:41.530 --> 04:06:42.530]  Cal State Los Angeles.
[04:06:42.530 --> 04:06:43.931]  Can we get on that, guys?
[04:06:43.931 --> 04:06:46.292]  They are evacuating the school.
[04:06:46.292 --> 04:06:48.172]  They've never done this in my four years here.
[04:06:48.172 --> 04:06:49.553]  It's never been this big.
[04:06:49.553 --> 04:06:53.214]  My cousin called me to tell me that they're closing down the school because of a bomb threat.
[04:06:53.214 --> 04:06:55.495]  Okay, you say you attend the school?
[04:06:55.495 --> 04:06:58.856]  I attend the school, yes, but I don't go until later tonight.
[04:06:58.856 --> 04:07:04.398]  My cousin called me to let me know she was there, that they're evacuating people.
[04:07:05.482 --> 04:07:07.824]  And it's because of a bomb threat.
[04:07:07.824 --> 04:07:09.585]  Class has been cancelled for today.
[04:07:09.585 --> 04:07:14.088]  Okay, do you know anything about the number of bombs or suspects or anything like that?
[04:07:14.088 --> 04:07:17.751]  No, again, this has barely been happening within an hour.
[04:07:17.751 --> 04:07:19.852]  There's no news reports on this whatsoever.
[04:07:19.852 --> 04:07:22.534]  This is all very live happening right now.
[04:07:22.534 --> 04:07:24.976]  So I have no information except just to get it out there.
[04:07:25.556 --> 04:07:29.358]  Okay, all right, so we'll definitely we'll definitely look into that.
[04:07:29.358 --> 04:07:30.218]  Thank you for your call.
[04:07:30.218 --> 04:07:30.758]  We'll move on.
[04:07:30.758 --> 04:07:31.819]  No problem.
[04:07:31.819 --> 04:07:32.079]  Thank you.
[04:07:32.079 --> 04:07:32.419]  We'll move on.
[04:07:32.419 --> 04:07:33.859]  Info Warrior for life.
[04:07:33.859 --> 04:07:34.199]  All right.
[04:07:34.199 --> 04:07:34.600]  Thank you.
[04:07:34.600 --> 04:07:35.460]  Info Warrior for life.
[04:07:35.460 --> 04:07:36.800]  I like that right there.
[04:07:36.800 --> 04:07:39.201]  Just let me know if you find any information on that.
[04:07:39.201 --> 04:07:43.803]  We'll move on to Dustin in Tennessee.
[04:07:43.803 --> 04:07:48.305]  First of all, I want to say I appreciate it and for all the info that you provide.
[04:07:48.305 --> 04:07:50.906]  I have a lot of key points that I want to
[04:07:51.522 --> 04:07:52.882]  Spit out as quick as possible.
[04:07:52.882 --> 04:07:54.703]  First, I was right there with y'all.
[04:07:54.703 --> 04:08:02.065]  As soon as I found out about the Boston thing, I jumped on the HLN, started posting links to y'all's webpage.
[04:08:02.065 --> 04:08:04.586]  Of course, they immediately started bringing them down.
[04:08:04.586 --> 04:08:06.746]  And as soon as they brought it up, they were bringing them down.
[04:08:06.746 --> 04:08:09.527]  Well, then they stopped bringing them down, of course.
[04:08:09.527 --> 04:08:19.110]  Because then they know, oh, well, someone sees that these are being brought down, so they're going to start having attention towards us.
[04:08:20.842 --> 04:08:29.727]  Separate from all that, a couple of years ago, y'all probably remember this, they had a couple of terrorists, I put quotes around that.
[04:08:29.727 --> 04:08:35.931]  There was a terrorist that had drone planes that they planned on blowing up the Pentagon.
[04:08:35.931 --> 04:08:42.654]  Well, how did they know about all of this, but had no clue about this Boston bomb at all?
[04:08:42.654 --> 04:08:43.315]  How does it happen?
[04:08:43.643 --> 04:08:44.804]  Well, that's always the question.
[04:08:44.804 --> 04:08:48.747]  How do they miss something, you know, let's talk about 9-11, as big as 9-11?
[04:08:48.747 --> 04:09:05.581]  You know, they can foil these little mom-and-pop bomb pods and, you know, little shoot-em-ups that never happen, but something this big and grand, you know, you know, the Boston, I mean, it definitely injured a lot of people, but as far as taking life, you know, the numbers weren't that significant, even though we definitely mourned the loss of the people who did die.
[04:09:05.581 --> 04:09:06.422]  But that is a question.
[04:09:06.422 --> 04:09:07.323]  Why do you think that, David Knight?
[04:09:07.571 --> 04:09:19.319]  Well, the police chief has said that, in a part of a press conference, he said that they had more people than they'd ever had at this event, and he said they were particularly focused on the finish line.
[04:09:19.319 --> 04:09:21.621]  And so the question is, why is that?
[04:09:21.621 --> 04:09:30.627]  Especially when they will not confirm or deny, maybe they have denied that they had a bomb drill going, but he would not confirm or deny that with Dan Bonandi initially.
[04:09:30.627 --> 04:09:33.329]  I don't know if they have subsequently changed their story on that.
[04:09:33.969 --> 04:09:36.331]  But we see all the people that were there.
[04:09:36.331 --> 04:09:44.155]  We see a tremendous number of people there and we have an eyewitness report saying that they were telling people not to be afraid, that it was just a drill.
[04:09:44.155 --> 04:09:57.223]  The Mobile, Alabama, University of Mobile track coach was there and he said he's run a lot of these events and never seen this kind of security, never seen bomb drills, never seen bomb sniffing dogs at the starting and at the finishing line.
[04:09:57.223 --> 04:10:00.225]  The bottom line is, is that these people cannot keep you safe.
[04:10:01.178 --> 04:10:10.765]  If they can't, if they weren't planting the bomb, if they weren't doing a drill to kind of cover for the bomb as we saw happen with September 11th and so many other events as we've talked about.
[04:10:12.868 --> 04:10:16.591]  If they couldn't do it there, then they're not going to be able to protect you.
[04:10:16.591 --> 04:10:23.896]  You should not give up and surrender your liberties for people who basically are not capable of delivering on their promise of security.
[04:10:23.896 --> 04:10:24.377]  Exactly.
[04:10:24.377 --> 04:10:25.498]  Thank you for your call, Dustin.
[04:10:25.498 --> 04:10:32.022]  We do have that black helicopter clip ready to dovetail what Harry Reid said and what Joe Biden has said about black helicopters.
[04:10:32.022 --> 04:10:37.646]  So let's go ahead and roll that footage.
[04:10:37.646 --> 04:10:40.348]  Let me read some of the things they're saying about background checks.
[04:10:40.348 --> 04:10:41.009]  They say, quote,
[04:10:41.738 --> 04:10:55.494]  We, the federal government, want to put every private firearms transaction right under the thumb of the federal government and keep all those names in a massive federal registry.
[04:10:55.494 --> 04:10:57.497]  Kind of scary, man.
[04:10:57.497 --> 04:10:59.519]  Black helicopter crowd really is upset.
[04:11:00.262 --> 04:11:03.203]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[04:11:03.203 --> 04:11:10.927]  Vice President Joe Biden is once again criticizing those concerned about their Second Amendment rights, calling them, quote, the black helicopter crowd.
[04:11:10.927 --> 04:11:16.769]  Now, InfoWars has well documented how black helicopters are very much real and active in the United States.
[04:11:16.769 --> 04:11:21.972]  Helicopters and the sound of gunfire created a lot of concern this afternoon in one Houston neighborhood.
[04:11:22.572 --> 04:11:32.102]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military, as someone shots a video of some of these choppers, military-style choppers.
[04:11:32.102 --> 04:11:36.746]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[04:11:36.746 --> 04:11:39.169]  They are training in an urban environment.
[04:11:39.169 --> 04:11:39.689]  The U.S.
[04:11:39.689 --> 04:11:44.034]  Special Operations Command will be conducting these exercises until the beginning of September.
[04:11:44.474 --> 04:11:56.601]  Now let's take a look at a different part of Biden's speech, where he says not only is there no FBI database of firearm purchases, according to him, the FBI shreds purchase information immediately after processing.
[04:11:56.601 --> 04:12:10.509]  And within 24 hours of being told that you can sell that gun, the FBI must destroy the information.
[04:12:10.509 --> 04:12:12.750]  There is no record kept.
[04:12:13.502 --> 04:12:18.145]  And this reporter may have been fooled by Biden's rhetoric had it not been for these articles.
[04:12:43.302 --> 04:12:45.303]  Let's take a look at these articles.
[04:12:45.303 --> 04:12:48.505]  FBI caught lying to spy on reporters.
[04:12:48.505 --> 04:12:51.966]  FBI caught lying about carrier IQ spying.
[04:12:51.966 --> 04:12:58.469]  And FBI made up threats at peace rally lied to Congress to justify spying activity.
[04:12:58.469 --> 04:13:07.814]  And just in case you think Biden misspoke like Mrs. Clinton when she misspoke about having to dodge sniper fire, let's take a look at these clips of Biden saying he did not vote for war.
[04:13:08.393 --> 04:13:13.816]  They talk about this great recession if it fell out of the sky, like, oh my goodness, where did it come from?
[04:13:13.816 --> 04:13:22.240]  It came from this man voting to put two wars in a credit card, to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit in the credit card.
[04:13:22.240 --> 04:13:25.422]  A trillion dollar tax cut for a very wealthy.
[04:13:25.422 --> 04:13:25.922]  I was there.
[04:13:25.922 --> 04:13:27.283]  I voted against him.
[04:13:27.283 --> 04:13:28.884]  I said, no, we can't afford that.
[04:13:28.884 --> 04:13:29.504]  I was there.
[04:13:29.504 --> 04:13:30.385]  I voted against him.
[04:13:31.205 --> 04:13:32.986]  All right, that's enough, guys.
[04:13:32.986 --> 04:13:33.707]  That's enough.
[04:13:33.707 --> 04:13:35.247]  And if that didn't convince you, let's take one more.
[04:13:35.247 --> 04:13:37.849]  All right, so there you go, the black helicopters.
[04:13:37.849 --> 04:13:38.889]  That was just a short piece.
[04:13:38.889 --> 04:13:39.810]  David, you made that piece.
[04:13:39.810 --> 04:13:41.691]  How many examples were there?
[04:13:41.691 --> 04:13:43.372]  Oh, there was five or six.
[04:13:43.372 --> 04:13:48.134]  And they were, at the time we did it, the reason we did that special report was because they were hitting like every couple of days.
[04:13:48.134 --> 04:13:50.475]  They were doing it through a stretch there.
[04:13:51.696 --> 04:14:02.124]  And one of the things that was striking about that was they kept telling people, well, we have to train in exactly as close to the scenario that we're going to execute as possible.
[04:14:02.124 --> 04:14:05.887]  So if we're going to attack a naval target, we practice on the water.
[04:14:05.887 --> 04:14:07.689]  If we're going to go in the mountains, we practice in the mountains.
[04:14:07.689 --> 04:14:10.231]  And so we're practicing for urban warfare.
[04:14:10.231 --> 04:14:11.392]  But they're doing a joint
[04:14:12.675 --> 04:14:13.535]  I don't think so.
[04:14:13.535 --> 04:14:14.656]  Hey, how's it going, guys?
[04:14:42.096 --> 04:14:42.496]  Very well.
[04:14:42.496 --> 04:14:50.064]  I just want to commend you guys for your hard work and it's really just amazing how we've got these guys red-handed now.
[04:14:50.064 --> 04:14:55.049]  And, you know, just hope that America's eyes are opened up real soon.
[04:14:56.969 --> 04:15:10.332]  I just wanted to call him at one point, and it just seems to me that the rights of all Americans are being attacked, and the liberties of our, you know, that our forefathers fought for are, you know, really being taken away from us before our eyes.
[04:15:10.332 --> 04:15:16.354]  But when you really look at it closely, it seems like they're really attacking one particular group, and that is Christians.
[04:15:16.354 --> 04:15:20.675]  And I'm just wondering if you guys could talk about that a little bit, and, you know, just
[04:15:21.698 --> 04:15:39.016]  Well, yeah, we see the religious persecution, people saying that, well, we've seen the different documents saying that even evangelical Christians are going to be your new threat.
[04:15:39.016 --> 04:15:39.517]  They're taking
[04:15:40.896 --> 04:15:41.296]  Christian
[04:16:00.763 --> 04:16:02.744]  Oh, a little technical difficulty there.
[04:16:02.744 --> 04:16:09.968]  That's a report I've been trying to complete for the past couple weeks, but you know, just a lot of inundated news with the gun stuff and the bomb threats.
[04:16:09.968 --> 04:16:11.808]  But David Knight, what do you think about that?
[04:16:11.808 --> 04:16:17.411]  Well, he was just talking about Christians and it just broke, I think it was just last week, yet another one of these incidents.
[04:16:17.411 --> 04:16:23.754]  We had one, of course, the MIAC report going all the way back to 2009, that InfoWars broke.
[04:16:23.754 --> 04:16:29.117]  You had a fusion center that was talking about Christians essentially being the number one targets along with
[04:16:30.652 --> 04:16:47.165]  So we also had a West Point think tank do that a couple of months ago, and then just last week we had a Lieutenant Colonel Jack Rich, and he sent out an email, a fairly lengthy email, to his subordinates, and it was basically going down the talking points of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[04:16:47.945 --> 04:17:04.122]  And in that, he identified the American Family Association and the Family Research Council, along with the Westboro Baptists, who is a very hateful group that always shows up at military funerals yelling and screaming at the soldiers because of homosexuality.
[04:17:04.122 --> 04:17:05.824]  That's the one thing they're fixated on.
[04:17:08.126 --> 04:17:12.128]  That's one place I would agree with the Southern Poverty Law Center on.
[04:17:12.128 --> 04:17:15.370]  That group comes across as a genuine, hateful group.
[04:17:15.370 --> 04:17:19.712]  They don't exhibit the love of Christ or the grace of Christ to anybody that I've seen.
[04:17:19.712 --> 04:17:27.877]  But to put the AFA and the Family Research Council into the same category, and he told people that they don't share Army values.
[04:17:28.437 --> 04:17:29.798]  And you need to be aware of these groups.
[04:17:29.798 --> 04:17:35.402]  And this is something that he's putting out there where he's condemning groups like the Ku Klux Klan and so forth and so on.
[04:17:35.402 --> 04:17:46.430]  So when he takes some mainstream Christian organizations like the American Family Association and the Family Research Council, throws them in that mix, it is just clearly a case of trying to demonize these people.
[04:17:46.430 --> 04:17:47.791]  Alright, thank you for your call, Mike.
[04:17:47.791 --> 04:17:51.014]  We just confirmed that breaking news story about Cal State.
[04:17:51.014 --> 04:17:51.694]  Is that correct, guys?
[04:17:51.694 --> 04:17:52.855]  Can we put that article back up?
[04:17:55.239 --> 04:17:57.040]  Guys are getting it right there.
[04:17:57.040 --> 04:17:58.921]  Okay.
[04:17:58.921 --> 04:18:01.143]  A bomb scare in Cal State.
[04:18:01.143 --> 04:18:01.583]  There it is.
[04:18:01.583 --> 04:18:02.944]  Los Angeles Times.
[04:18:02.944 --> 04:18:04.625]  Cal State L.A.
[04:18:04.625 --> 04:18:05.245]  evacuated.
[04:18:05.245 --> 04:18:07.707]  Campus closed after bomb threat.
[04:18:07.707 --> 04:18:08.748]  So I do believe this is a
[04:18:09.704 --> 04:18:11.025]  Pretty recent news.
[04:18:11.025 --> 04:18:19.634]  I guess they don't have any suspects or definitive explosive devices as of yet, but we will definitely keep you up to date the best we can on that subject.
[04:18:19.634 --> 04:18:21.636]  We'll move on to Jeff in Detroit.
[04:18:21.636 --> 04:18:23.658]  And Jeff, I have this article here.
[04:18:23.658 --> 04:18:25.559]  It talks about the ACLU.
[04:18:25.559 --> 04:18:29.523]  The Detroit police are dumping homeless people outside of the city.
[04:18:29.523 --> 04:18:30.524]  I'll read you the article.
[04:18:31.405 --> 04:18:41.541]  The Detroit police practice of essentially kidnapping homeless people and abandoning them miles away from the neighborhoods they know, which no means...
[04:18:42.881 --> 04:18:45.723]  With no means for a safe return is humane.
[04:18:45.723 --> 04:18:51.207]  Callous and illegal, said Sarah Meta, ACLU of Michigan staff attorney.
[04:18:51.207 --> 04:18:55.370]  Have you heard anything about them abducting homeless people and just dropping them outside the city?
[04:18:55.370 --> 04:18:58.152]  They did that in the first Rambo movie.
[04:18:58.152 --> 04:19:01.814]  They picked them up and they dropped them outside the city and he came back and tore some stuff up.
[04:19:01.814 --> 04:19:03.736]  But what do you think about that, Jeff?
[04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:06.331]  Uh, can you hear me?
[04:19:06.331 --> 04:19:07.211]  Yes.
[04:19:07.211 --> 04:19:08.751]  I think it's pretty far for the course.
[04:19:08.751 --> 04:19:18.314]  Uh, if you remember during the Super Bowl, in the Detroit hoops for the Super Bowl, what they did was they painted, uh, like an old western scene out of a, out of a movie set from Hollywood.
[04:19:18.314 --> 04:19:22.516]  They painted fronts of buildings to make them look like they weren't, uh, dilapidated and
[04:19:23.876 --> 04:19:24.556]  Uninhabited.
[04:19:24.556 --> 04:19:30.739]  So people that were coming, driving into the Super Bowl from the city thought the city looked nice when it was just basically fronts on the buildings.
[04:19:30.739 --> 04:19:32.739]  But Detroit police are a non-issue.
[04:19:32.739 --> 04:19:38.441]  They're cut back so far that you have to really look to find one down there, especially at nighttime.
[04:19:38.441 --> 04:19:39.522]  They don't even want to come out.
[04:19:39.522 --> 04:19:43.323]  And the street lights don't come on, but I could talk about that for a long time.
[04:19:43.323 --> 04:19:49.105]  I think Chris Hedges said it best when he said Detroit is our first sacrificed city of the century, that the corporations have come in
[04:19:49.605 --> 04:19:53.317]  Fuck the resources and let the people to live in squalor basically.
[04:19:55.507 --> 04:20:06.593]  One of my points was, Alex always mentions multi-dimensional chess, and I think what happened yesterday was we checkmated them with a pawn.
[04:20:06.593 --> 04:20:08.574]  They weren't expecting that to happen.
[04:20:08.574 --> 04:20:14.717]  And what we're watching now is vampires in the light or a psychopath that's been exposed.
[04:20:14.717 --> 04:20:21.921]  They're not used to calling audibles when they run their ops like this, and we're watching them scramble, and they have not had practice with this.
[04:20:21.921 --> 04:20:23.822]  So I think what most people need to do
[04:20:24.882 --> 04:20:30.965]  Alex mentioned earlier that the search engines are now searching false flags.
[04:20:30.965 --> 04:20:32.325]  This is a narrative.
[04:20:32.325 --> 04:20:34.126]  You guys are controlling the narrative.
[04:20:34.126 --> 04:20:41.029]  I think when people, when their family members come up to them or friends and say, have you heard about this Boston thing?
[04:20:41.029 --> 04:20:47.572]  I think people need to step up to that point because it's wide open and say, yeah, have you looked up false flag?
[04:20:47.572 --> 04:20:53.495]  This is the perfect time to inject this in there because the information is readily out there and it's
[04:20:53.995 --> 04:20:58.236]  It's in people's minds, and this is the time for this to happen.
[04:20:58.236 --> 04:20:58.936]  Exactly.
[04:20:58.936 --> 04:21:01.717]  It's going to be interesting to see what they do with this press conference today at 4 o'clock.
[04:21:01.717 --> 04:21:04.738]  We're going to stick around and cover that, and we're going to have some analysis after that.
[04:21:04.738 --> 04:21:09.139]  But it definitely, as you said, put them on essentially calling audibles.
[04:21:09.139 --> 04:21:09.579]  Yeah.
[04:21:09.579 --> 04:21:15.161]  They had to improvise at the last minute here, because I think it kind of definitely put a hitch in their plans.
[04:21:15.161 --> 04:21:15.941]  Definitely, definitely.
[04:21:15.941 --> 04:21:17.542]  All right, Jeff, thank you for your call.
[04:21:17.542 --> 04:21:20.102]  We've got to move quick to another call.
[04:21:20.102 --> 04:21:21.303]  We have a call from Canada.
[04:21:21.303 --> 04:21:22.203]  V in Canada.
[04:21:23.683 --> 04:21:24.943]  Hi, how are you doing, guys?
[04:21:24.943 --> 04:21:26.504]  Very well.
[04:21:26.504 --> 04:21:28.905]  First, I want to salute you and Ms.
[04:21:28.905 --> 04:21:30.325]  Jones for the job that you're doing.
[04:21:30.325 --> 04:21:31.446]  It's outstanding.
[04:21:31.446 --> 04:21:33.806]  I think it's going to be remembered.
[04:21:33.806 --> 04:21:44.390]  I know that we are focusing right now on a false flag event that happened in Boston that everybody wants to talk about, but I want to bring two points very quickly, maybe looking a little bit further to the future.
[04:21:45.481 --> 04:21:59.252]  So, I think that from all of the situations that were occurring lately, it's very clear that at some point there will be additional actions from the government side.
[04:21:59.252 --> 04:22:04.156]  And at some point again, they will move towards something more drastic.
[04:22:04.156 --> 04:22:08.400]  Now, the idea that I'm trying to present is that we need leadership.
[04:22:09.364 --> 04:22:14.447]  Leadership in terms of people, in terms of politicians and maybe even military, I don't know.
[04:22:14.447 --> 04:22:19.810]  But the truth is that no movement can sustain itself without leadership.
[04:22:19.810 --> 04:22:26.694]  And that's why the government will be focusing on the leaders and try to discredit them, maybe even remove them.
[04:22:27.509 --> 04:22:40.380]  And I think we need to start looking for leaders on the political side, on the community side and everywhere else to help us come together when the situation really becomes intolerable.
[04:22:41.454 --> 04:22:46.896]  Exactly, that's why you need to support your local politicians, your national politicians who are on your side.
[04:22:46.896 --> 04:22:54.380]  You know, support, regardless if you agree with him on everything, support guys like Rand Paul and support Ted Cruz on gun bills and things such as that.
[04:22:54.380 --> 04:22:59.262]  I'm not exactly sure, you know, how your political climate is there in Canada, but I definitely agree with that statement.
[04:22:59.262 --> 04:23:02.844]  And I would say that we need to not be so exclusively focused on the top.
[04:23:03.624 --> 04:23:06.346]  We need to also get active at the local level.
[04:23:06.346 --> 04:23:14.593]  It's one of the things that people who are socialists have been very effective at doing is they've been much more effective at organizing at the local level.
[04:23:14.593 --> 04:23:24.521]  And we don't want to make the same mistake that the socialists, the communitarians make of trying to, you know, try to fix everything at the top level.
[04:23:25.400 --> 04:23:28.345]  Um, you know what, but they do activate at the lower level.
[04:23:28.345 --> 04:23:32.450]  They think nationally or globally and then they activate at the local level.
[04:23:32.450 --> 04:23:32.851]  Right.
[04:23:32.851 --> 04:23:38.919]  We need to be focused on individuals and we need to start, a lot of the resistance that we're seeing is coming from the state level.
[04:23:40.069 --> 04:23:48.717]  So we need to support people like those people here in Texas who are fighting back against the NDAA, who are fighting back against the TSA, trying to put restrictions on those.
[04:23:48.717 --> 04:23:56.064]  So people need to look and see what's going on in their area, and even try to support those areas outside of their state when there's something happening at a state level.
[04:23:56.064 --> 04:24:03.350]  We really do need to try to get back to a division of power between the Federals and the state, and we need to also keep in mind
[04:24:04.451 --> 04:24:08.834]  Yes sir, I just have one question about Boston.
[04:24:08.834 --> 04:24:09.154]  Sure.
[04:24:09.154 --> 04:24:14.778]  If we had all these policemen there, hundreds of them, and soldiers there, how many of them were hit by shrapnel when these things went off?
[04:24:14.778 --> 04:24:18.441]  I do not know the answer to that question.
[04:24:18.441 --> 04:24:21.282]  Or were they wanting to get out of the way?
[04:24:33.399 --> 04:24:45.529]  I don't know, because we've heard the reports, well, Rob Dewitt's given the story about his brother-in-law was in the army, I believe, he's a jogger in the army, and he was pulled out of the race, his brother-in-law, before the bombs went off.
[04:24:45.529 --> 04:24:52.354]  So, as far as I know, I'm not saying there haven't been, but I've not heard any stories of police or military being hit by the shrapnel.
[04:24:52.354 --> 04:24:52.795]  Have you, David?
[04:24:53.115 --> 04:24:56.176]  Well, it's hard to say, because they really haven't talked very much about any of the victims.
[04:24:56.176 --> 04:24:58.616]  It took them a very long time before they talked about who was hit.
[04:24:58.616 --> 04:25:06.298]  They had an eight-year-old, they released that right away, and then they waited a while, and they said there was a lady who was killed.
[04:25:06.298 --> 04:25:09.558]  And then last I heard, the third person who was killed was an Asian.
[04:25:09.558 --> 04:25:10.718]  Young lady.
[04:25:10.718 --> 04:25:11.879]  I don't know, yeah.
[04:25:11.879 --> 04:25:15.179]  But I haven't heard, there was a lot of people that were injured.
[04:25:15.179 --> 04:25:17.700]  I don't know, but that's a very good point, caller, that you made.
[04:25:17.700 --> 04:25:19.260]  We'll have to wait and see what happens with that.
[04:25:20.754 --> 04:25:22.155]  You think it's worth looking into?
[04:25:22.155 --> 04:25:24.896]  Maybe they were told to move on down the street and get the hell out of the way.
[04:25:24.896 --> 04:25:25.657]  Heck out of the way.
[04:25:41.826 --> 04:25:46.808]  We have to also remember that even in false flags, not everybody is clued in on it.
[04:25:46.808 --> 04:26:04.154]  So there could very well be, it would not mean that this was not a false flag if there were officers or security personnel that were injured because you really only have to have a couple of people who are basically inside on this thing and have the uniforms for something to work, you know, that kind of compartmentalization.
[04:26:04.154 --> 04:26:04.294]  Right.
[04:26:04.754 --> 04:26:06.277]  Alright, thank you for your call, and that's a good point.
[04:26:06.277 --> 04:26:08.681]  Anybody in the city of Boston, talk to your local police.
[04:26:08.681 --> 04:26:09.242]  Were they injured?
[04:26:09.242 --> 04:26:10.404]  Were they not injured?
[04:26:10.404 --> 04:26:13.350]  Joseph in North Carolina.
[04:26:13.350 --> 04:26:14.412]  Hey, how are you?
[04:26:14.412 --> 04:26:14.993]  Very well, sir.
[04:26:16.285 --> 04:26:22.868]  I'd like to say, before I start, that you guys are really great, and I really enjoy watching you.
[04:26:22.868 --> 04:26:24.388]  I've grown to appreciate you.
[04:26:24.388 --> 04:26:25.969]  I like Alex.
[04:26:25.969 --> 04:26:33.852]  Alex is sort of Rush Limbaugh with temper, but you guys are good also, and the more I watch you, the better I think you are.
[04:26:33.852 --> 04:26:37.673]  So, just with that little fan letter, I'll tell you that.
[04:26:37.673 --> 04:26:39.914]  The thing I wanted to say is that
[04:26:41.070 --> 04:26:50.592]  What Obama or what the globalists or whatever you want to call them were trying to do here was kind of a triple bank shot.
[04:26:50.592 --> 04:27:04.215]  They were trying to stage a terrorist incident that basically, as you said, would get TSA on the street and out of the airport, make everybody afraid there's going to be another one.
[04:27:04.215 --> 04:27:08.576]  And then they were hoping to basically arrest a patsy
[04:27:09.565 --> 04:27:13.519]  Who they then could blame the whole thing on reloaders.
[04:27:13.519 --> 04:27:15.004]  People who have gunpowder.
[04:27:16.943 --> 04:27:28.287]  And they were hoping that maybe they even could win the jackpot and arrest somebody who was an NRA member or at least a gun owner.
[04:27:28.287 --> 04:27:39.471]  So that actually this incident was timed and was intended to occur in conjunction with the consideration of the gun bill in Washington this week.
[04:27:40.831 --> 04:27:54.984]  I agree with that 100%, because when I've been going to the gun stores, like we did that bullet report for Alex a couple weeks ago, I was thinking to myself, the next thing they're going to try to outlaw is making your own ammunition and the supplies that are used therein.
[04:27:54.984 --> 04:27:55.464]  Absolutely.
[04:27:55.464 --> 04:27:58.387]  They were coming after registration, though.
[04:27:58.387 --> 04:27:59.508]  And I think that's been it.
[04:27:59.508 --> 04:28:03.852]  I mean, certainly this Fast and Furious was all about moving weapons across borders.
[04:28:04.512 --> 04:28:07.334]  And to try to stop weapons moving across borders.
[04:28:07.334 --> 04:28:09.036]  The solution of that, of course, was the U.N.
[04:28:09.036 --> 04:28:10.116]  Arms Trade Treaty.
[04:28:10.116 --> 04:28:14.159]  Those things have been in the works for a very long time, for many years.
[04:28:14.159 --> 04:28:16.141]  And I think all of this is pulled together.
[04:28:16.141 --> 04:28:21.705]  We're coming at registration, particularly on multiple fronts, and we certainly beat them back on that one yesterday.
[04:28:22.305 --> 04:28:24.227]  Alright, and thank you for your call, Joseph.
[04:28:24.227 --> 04:28:28.250]  The number to call in is 877-789-ALEX.
[04:28:28.250 --> 04:28:31.553]  That is 877-789-2539.
[04:28:31.553 --> 04:28:38.059]  And you can watch on InfoWars.com forward slash listen or on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[04:28:38.059 --> 04:28:42.023]  We'll move on now to Chris in Michigan.
[04:28:42.023 --> 04:28:42.743]  Hey, hello.
[04:28:42.743 --> 04:28:44.084]  Hello.
[04:28:44.084 --> 04:28:45.506]  How's it going?
[04:28:45.506 --> 04:28:48.008]  Yeah, today there was actually a bomb scare in Detroit.
[04:28:48.863 --> 04:28:50.323]  Wow.
[04:28:50.323 --> 04:28:50.563]  Where?
[04:28:50.563 --> 04:28:51.844]  I don't know if you guys heard about that yet.
[04:28:51.844 --> 04:28:53.104]  No, no, no.
[04:28:53.104 --> 04:28:54.324]  Yeah, they evacuated the street.
[04:28:54.324 --> 04:28:56.625]  My girlfriend actually lives down there.
[04:28:56.625 --> 04:28:57.525]  She had a bunch of pictures.
[04:28:57.525 --> 04:28:58.645]  They closed down the streets.
[04:28:58.645 --> 04:29:08.407]  And yesterday, the Detroit Free Press online posted an illustrated picture on how to build a pipe bomb, or not a pipe bomb, the pressure cooker bomb.
[04:29:08.407 --> 04:29:13.448]  Now, before we get to the pressure cooker, you said that the bomb scare was today or yesterday?
[04:29:14.660 --> 04:29:16.302]  The bomb scare was today.
[04:29:16.302 --> 04:29:19.204]  Is it still ongoing?
[04:29:19.204 --> 04:29:19.784]  Say what?
[04:29:19.784 --> 04:29:22.366]  Is the bomb scare still ongoing?
[04:29:22.366 --> 04:29:23.007]  Um, no.
[04:29:23.007 --> 04:29:24.868]  They defused it.
[04:29:27.879 --> 04:29:29.941]  But there's another bomb square.
[04:29:29.941 --> 04:29:36.005]  I posted on Facebook someone else saying there's a bomb square in Washington and then one caller said there's one in L.A.
[04:29:36.005 --> 04:29:37.766]  and it just seems like all over the country.
[04:29:37.766 --> 04:29:39.007]  Yeah, there's a lot going on.
[04:29:39.007 --> 04:29:40.789]  There's going to be a lot of copycat stuff like that.
[04:29:40.789 --> 04:29:41.689]  There always is.
[04:29:41.689 --> 04:29:45.052]  I remember back when I was in high school and that was a long time ago.
[04:29:45.052 --> 04:29:46.513]  We used to have bomb squares regularly.
[04:29:46.513 --> 04:29:49.035]  Of course, I think it was kids calling up to try to get out of exams.
[04:29:49.035 --> 04:29:52.117]  But now, especially when you've got something... But this was an actual bomb that they defused.
[04:29:52.117 --> 04:29:53.218]  Oh, they did find a bomb, okay.
[04:29:53.838 --> 04:29:54.539]  Alright.
[04:29:54.539 --> 04:30:13.719]  So, I mean, if people are thinking the Boston one's an inside job or whatever, a false flag, who's to say that they're not trying to, you know, be the copycats and just completely scare all of us, you know, into believing that anything you go to... Yeah, we'll look into those other scares, but you're talking about they had a article on how to build a bomb?
[04:30:14.648 --> 04:30:33.358]  Yeah, and how to build the pressure cooker bomb, they had, it was a pretty illustrated graphic on how to make one, and then lo and behold the next day, you know, they apologized for it, but if people die because now they, everyone knows how to make one, you know, they can't apologize for people dying, you know, you can't just say sorry and it's all good.
[04:30:33.358 --> 04:30:34.879]  Why would you publish something like that?
[04:30:34.879 --> 04:30:36.220]  I just don't understand that.
[04:30:36.220 --> 04:30:40.742]  You know, there's an interesting article on InfoWars today, and it was by John Rappaport.
[04:30:41.483 --> 04:30:56.930]  And he's talking about, actually he linked to a YouTube video, a guy did an analysis and he said, if they were building this pressure cooker bomb the way they were showing it on CNN with nails inside and that sort of thing, you would expect it to be concentric and you would expect it to be riddled with holes.
[04:30:56.930 --> 04:31:00.972]  The exploded pressure cooker that they found was not.
[04:31:00.972 --> 04:31:03.753]  It was basically just blown out in one direction.
[04:31:03.753 --> 04:31:05.434]  The only hole in it was a machined hole.
[04:31:06.774 --> 04:31:14.196]  And he was saying it looked to him like it was a shaped charge, which would indicate that it wasn't necessarily an amateur that was doing something like this, but somebody who was more sophisticated.
[04:31:14.196 --> 04:31:17.617]  So there's a lot of back and forth that's going to be going on about this.
[04:31:17.617 --> 04:31:29.101]  And certainly we believe that, like I said, it certainly was a motivation for the government to be a part of a false flag operation because we know how they use these things.
[04:31:29.101 --> 04:31:35.163]  The thing that really kicked it, though, for us was not just that they had motive and something to gain from it, but that they also
[04:31:35.663 --> 04:31:36.063]  I think so.
[04:31:54.173 --> 04:31:55.714]  Exactly, and they're confident.
[04:31:55.714 --> 04:32:02.538]  They're confident that if they don't get their way, if Napolitano has her budget slashed, if Feinstein can't get the guns off the streets, there'll be more.
[04:32:02.538 --> 04:32:08.361]  And let me say this, and that's another reason why it's important for people to understand what a false flag is.
[04:32:08.361 --> 04:32:11.883]  So many people do not understand the M.O.
[04:32:11.883 --> 04:32:15.665]  of the government and how they shape the narrative, how they manipulate the public.
[04:32:15.665 --> 04:32:20.909]  A false flag has a very long history to it, and it's been used recently in a lot of different things.
[04:32:21.869 --> 04:32:26.410]  We documented that in our very first magazine going back for decades.
[04:32:26.410 --> 04:32:45.193]  Documents that have now been declassified and there are other aspects that are more recent going back to September 11th and other attacks like that in the last 10 years has been so many times they've used that where they have a drill at exactly the same time, exactly the same place, exactly the same threat level happens simultaneously.
[04:32:45.193 --> 04:32:50.494]  That just is incredible and people need to understand what their MO is and if we can understand that
[04:32:51.054 --> 04:32:56.978]  We can shut down some of these horrific events that they're going to pull off if people are ignorant about it.
[04:32:56.978 --> 04:32:58.880]  So that's why it's so important to get that term out there.
[04:32:58.880 --> 04:33:03.763]  It's why it's so great that that's trending high now after Dan Bodondi at the press conference.
[04:33:03.763 --> 04:33:04.824]  He really pushed that.
[04:33:04.824 --> 04:33:05.885]  Great job, Dan.
[04:33:05.885 --> 04:33:06.685]  Great job, Dan.
[04:33:06.685 --> 04:33:07.386]  Thank you for your call, Chris.
[04:33:07.386 --> 04:33:08.367]  You can save lives.
[04:33:08.367 --> 04:33:13.771]  We'll move on to CJ in Michigan.
[04:33:13.771 --> 04:33:15.572]  Hello?
[04:33:15.572 --> 04:33:16.933]  Yeah, hey, listen.
[04:33:18.451 --> 04:33:23.174]  This Waco thing, this turns out to be some kind of event.
[04:33:23.174 --> 04:33:26.196]  What I'm predicting, everyone likes predictions, is...
[04:33:27.282 --> 04:33:39.105]  If it is, that would tell you that they're planning a bunch of events because they would never do something so close to another event because then that would take out the mileage that they're going to get from the Boston Marathon.
[04:33:39.105 --> 04:33:48.507]  I predicted this a couple years ago that you always heard about Iran's going to have these sleeper cells and they're going to be activated.
[04:33:50.020 --> 04:33:54.562]  You know, if they want to have martial law, you know, it's a big event like the World Trade Center.
[04:33:54.562 --> 04:33:56.562]  You know, ooh, I'm scared, but it's New York.
[04:33:56.562 --> 04:33:57.783]  I don't live in New York.
[04:33:57.783 --> 04:34:04.445]  But once they start hitting the soft targets here and there, small-town America, then, Mr. and Ms.
[04:34:04.445 --> 04:34:09.347]  America, we have to implement martial law because no one's safe anywhere.
[04:34:09.787 --> 04:34:10.648]  That's right.
[04:34:10.648 --> 04:34:12.008]  That's pretty much what we're seeing already.
[04:34:12.008 --> 04:34:19.393]  We've seen the pictures in Boston of the guys checking papers and people just willingly accept that because of the situation.
[04:34:19.393 --> 04:34:20.634]  And I mean, it's not just there.
[04:34:20.634 --> 04:34:22.375]  Like we said, it's been many other places.
[04:34:22.375 --> 04:34:25.897]  We saw them at a checkpoint at LAX or outside LAX.
[04:34:25.897 --> 04:34:27.218]  They were checking people.
[04:34:27.218 --> 04:34:32.762]  And if these things happen more frequent, especially if they hit hometown America, like you said, people are just going to roll over.
[04:34:32.762 --> 04:34:33.282]  Oh, absolutely.
[04:34:33.462 --> 04:34:34.783]  Yeah.
[04:34:34.783 --> 04:34:38.347]  Their agenda is advanced by fear and paranoia.
[04:34:38.347 --> 04:34:39.788]  That's what they accuse us of.
[04:34:39.788 --> 04:34:48.196]  But as you documented in that report that was really good that you put in there, how many times have we seen Biden and Obama go back on their word?
[04:34:48.196 --> 04:34:51.239]  Obama wasn't going to sign the NDAA, and then he did.
[04:34:51.239 --> 04:34:52.820]  They weren't going to ban guns, and then they did.
[04:34:52.820 --> 04:34:57.945]  I mean, just over and over and over again, even in the debate where he's accusing the other guy of signing on the war.
[04:34:57.945 --> 04:34:59.186]  They're pointing at each other.
[04:34:59.546 --> 04:35:05.732]  And actually the other guy did sign, it was a valid criticism, but he was saying that he wasn't a part of it, when in actuality he was.
[04:35:05.732 --> 04:35:08.374]  And people just have to go back and look at the records.
[04:35:08.374 --> 04:35:17.802]  But they think we're so stupid that we won't go back and look at their lies on YouTube, that we won't go back and look at their voting record, and you know, you showed it.
[04:35:17.802 --> 04:35:23.707]  And that's the thing, we have to pull those things up and we have to show each other what they're doing and just expose their lies.
[04:35:23.707 --> 04:35:25.048]  Alright, thank you for your call.
[04:35:25.048 --> 04:35:26.890]  We'll move on to Bruce in Canada.
[04:35:28.032 --> 04:35:29.552]  Well, hey guys, how are you doing?
[04:35:29.552 --> 04:35:31.033]  Very well, very well.
[04:35:31.033 --> 04:35:32.113]  Hey, great.
[04:35:32.113 --> 04:35:33.594]  I called a couple days ago.
[04:35:33.594 --> 04:35:35.714]  I didn't mean to sound sarcastic.
[04:35:35.714 --> 04:35:37.635]  I think you guys are doing an awesome job.
[04:35:37.635 --> 04:35:40.316]  I really, I mean that sincerely.
[04:35:40.316 --> 04:35:43.057]  I'm sorry I didn't sound sarcastic last time.
[04:35:43.057 --> 04:35:44.617]  Oh, no, that's fine.
[04:35:44.617 --> 04:35:51.939]  I hear you guys hit the acceleration pedal, and I mean, I want to just give you a couple catalysts, which, you know what catalysts are?
[04:35:51.939 --> 04:35:56.981]  They're just to speed up a reaction of the awakening here, and I mean, you got this whole
[04:35:58.732 --> 04:35:59.172]  Yes, go ahead.
[04:35:59.172 --> 04:36:02.514]  Sorry, Bruce, you're cutting in, uh, cutting out a little bit.
[04:36:02.514 --> 04:36:04.135]  Alright, well, we'll hold on for one second.
[04:36:04.135 --> 04:36:06.236]  Hopefully he can get his connection established.
[04:36:06.236 --> 04:36:07.157]  Yeah, that sounds better.
[04:36:23.177 --> 04:36:24.097]  Oh, okay.
[04:36:24.097 --> 04:36:26.718]  Um, so did you hear what I was saying about the magazine?
[04:36:26.718 --> 04:36:34.981]  I mean, you got thousands of people that would just sell those things to, like, a dentist's office, a mechanic's office, and everything like that in their community.
[04:36:34.981 --> 04:36:37.842]  Just, uh, you know, just make it simple for them, right?
[04:36:37.842 --> 04:36:42.064]  And, uh, here's what I do when I have a couple extra of Obama deceptions.
[04:36:42.064 --> 04:36:43.305]  Hard copies of that.
[04:36:43.305 --> 04:36:47.146]  So I'll wrap them in, like, the Infowars magazine thing that comes
[04:36:48.197 --> 04:36:49.238]  I'm sorry, Bruce.
[04:36:49.238 --> 04:36:50.178]  We do appreciate your call.
[04:36:50.178 --> 04:36:52.739]  We just have a bad phone line.
[04:36:52.739 --> 04:36:56.400]  I'm sorry, maybe call back again and maybe try a different phone.
[04:36:56.400 --> 04:36:57.480]  Thank you for your call, though.
[04:36:57.480 --> 04:36:59.041]  We'll move on to Kay in New Jersey.
[04:37:06.195 --> 04:37:10.217]  Reiterate how disgusted I am with the incompetence.
[04:37:10.217 --> 04:37:17.942]  We can clearly see how Jenna Napolitano is having some trouble keeping up with the initial story during that conference.
[04:37:17.942 --> 04:37:27.768]  And I can't believe that she actually had the nerve to say that it's unreasonable for them
[04:37:28.951 --> 04:37:33.173]  To not do what they did, which was deport that one suspect.
[04:37:33.173 --> 04:37:36.955]  Let's just say this was a regular domestic issue.
[04:37:36.955 --> 04:37:44.238]  The police would question and have everybody at the scene in for questioning.
[04:37:44.238 --> 04:37:48.580]  Nobody would be set free until the investigation was concluded.
[04:37:48.580 --> 04:37:49.361]  So to see her
[04:37:50.245 --> 04:37:57.552]  With a more large-scale incident, to say that it's perfectly reasonable to let somebody go like that is just beyond me.
[04:37:57.552 --> 04:37:58.993]  Well, that's nothing new.
[04:37:58.993 --> 04:38:06.320]  I mean, we've seen them destroy evidence and cover up a crime scene before at Oklahoma City, at the World Trade Center.
[04:38:06.320 --> 04:38:13.026]  They don't really follow on these big events like this that have all the hallmarks of a false flag that we believe are false flags.
[04:38:13.026 --> 04:38:15.348]  They don't follow the typical rules of investigation.
[04:38:16.155 --> 04:38:20.500]  Exactly, just like the Oklahoma City building, to cover that up, they just tore the building down.
[04:38:20.500 --> 04:38:21.981]  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
[04:38:21.981 --> 04:38:25.045]  Removed the evidence at 9-11 as well.
[04:38:25.045 --> 04:38:25.986]  Did you have another point, Kay?
[04:38:27.454 --> 04:38:53.565]  ...of the World Trade Center started to get shipped to foreign landfills, but I just, what I'm really trying to say is the fact that she thinks that we don't, or Congress doesn't understand the procedures of these types of things, that she can just say anything to us, the same way Alex keeps saying that they had all the seals out there in uniform, like we can't see that, like they've done this so many times before, but we're not getting any dumber, we're just figuring it out, so this is,
[04:38:54.225 --> 04:38:58.669]  They can't afford to just lie to us like this anymore, that's what I'm trying to say.
[04:38:58.669 --> 04:39:07.458]  We got that clip queued up and we're going to take a look at it, but you all need to go to YouTube so that you can actually see that because it's just the arrogance of her.
[04:39:07.458 --> 04:39:09.239]  The way she looks at this congressman... I'll tell you, I'll tell you...
[04:39:11.281 --> 04:39:17.771]  We'll get around to informing you, sir, when we come up with a story that we think that you can comprehend.
[04:39:17.771 --> 04:39:18.852]  It's like, how dare you?
[04:39:18.852 --> 04:39:20.535]  How dare you question me?
[04:39:20.535 --> 04:39:23.479]  It was just amazing, the arrogance.
[04:39:23.479 --> 04:39:25.582]  But also, you could see the anger and the frustration.
[04:39:26.343 --> 04:39:27.504]  And he's rolling her eyes.
[04:39:27.504 --> 04:39:29.485]  I thought her hair was about to spin around backwards.
[04:39:29.485 --> 04:39:30.066]  You gotta love that.
[04:39:30.066 --> 04:39:34.429]  It's kind of like that press conference that Obama and Biden had yesterday after they lost that gun control bill.
[04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:36.971]  You know, the Germans call that Schadenfreude.
[04:39:36.971 --> 04:39:40.073]  It was so funny to see, guys, let me know when we have that clip.
[04:39:40.073 --> 04:39:41.595]  It's so funny to see Biden's face.
[04:39:41.595 --> 04:39:43.896]  It looked like his hamster just died or something.
[04:39:43.896 --> 04:39:49.160]  And he's like, oh, yeah, I try to do this with children.
[04:39:49.160 --> 04:39:50.581]  Yeah.
[04:39:50.581 --> 04:39:51.882]  OK, thank you for your call, Kay.
[04:39:51.882 --> 04:39:53.844]  We're going to go now to that clip of Napolitano.
[04:39:54.819 --> 04:40:01.147]  I'm very concerned about this person of interest that was detained at the hospital in Boston following the Marathon Madness.
[04:40:01.147 --> 04:40:03.891]  He is, I believe, scheduled to be deported next week.
[04:40:03.891 --> 04:40:10.840]  And now, I understand he's been cleared of any wrongdoing in the involvement in Boston, but he is being deported due to national security concerns.
[04:40:11.400 --> 04:40:12.560]  But CBS says this.
[04:40:12.560 --> 04:40:14.301]  This gentleman is here on a student visa.
[04:40:14.301 --> 04:40:17.582]  He was at the scene along with many other people when the blast happened.
[04:40:17.582 --> 04:40:22.804]  As everybody's standing in shock, three Boston PD detectives see this guy moving quickly out of the crowd.
[04:40:22.804 --> 04:40:25.465]  As they're watching him, he seems to be moving very deliberately.
[04:40:26.525 --> 04:40:28.606]  Which could be a very natural thing after a bombing.
[04:40:28.606 --> 04:40:30.347]  They stop him because he's covered with blood.
[04:40:30.347 --> 04:40:31.467]  They end up taking him to the hospital.
[04:40:31.467 --> 04:40:33.388]  That's straight off CBS.
[04:40:33.388 --> 04:40:42.211]  And we're asking average Americans to help ID and assist law enforcement in identifying who the bomber was.
[04:40:42.211 --> 04:40:43.332]  See something, say something.
[04:40:43.812 --> 04:40:51.017]  And now we have someone who is being deported due to national security concerns, and I'm assuming that he's got some sort of link to terror, or he wouldn't be being deported.
[04:40:51.017 --> 04:40:52.217]  He was at the scene.
[04:40:52.217 --> 04:41:01.063]  He could possibly ID the bomber, just like we're asking every other American that was on the scene to provide your pictures, help us identify who may have been acting funny.
[04:41:01.063 --> 04:41:05.666]  Everybody, we're asking that that was in Boston, and we've got this guy who was there.
[04:41:05.666 --> 04:41:06.586]  We know he was there.
[04:41:06.586 --> 04:41:09.828]  He was arrested, or was detained in the hospital, covered with blood.
[04:41:09.828 --> 04:41:12.370]  He was at the scene, and yet we're going to deport him.
[04:41:12.890 --> 04:41:16.392]  So we're going to remove him from the scene.
[04:41:16.392 --> 04:41:24.537]  I am unaware of anyone who is being deported for national security concerns at all related to Boston.
[04:41:24.537 --> 04:41:25.598]  I don't know where that room is from.
[04:41:25.598 --> 04:41:28.260]  Not saying it's related to Boston, but he is being deported.
[04:41:28.260 --> 04:41:37.105]  No, like I said, again, I don't even think he was technically a person of interest or a suspect.
[04:41:37.105 --> 04:41:38.166]  That was a wash.
[04:41:38.846 --> 04:41:41.547]  And I'm unaware of any proceeding there.
[04:41:41.547 --> 04:41:42.967]  I will clarify that for you.
[04:41:42.967 --> 04:41:49.709]  But I think this is an example of why it is so important to let law enforcement do its job.
[04:41:49.709 --> 04:41:50.829]  I want them to do their job.
[04:41:50.829 --> 04:42:00.431]  And that's why I say, wouldn't you agree with me that it's negligent for us as American administration to deport someone who was reportedly at the scene of the bombing?
[04:42:00.431 --> 04:42:03.172]  And we're going to deport him not to be able to question him anymore.
[04:42:03.172 --> 04:42:04.152]  Is that not negligence?
[04:42:04.612 --> 04:42:06.013]  I'm not going to answer that question.
[04:42:06.013 --> 04:42:12.899]  It is so full with misstatements and misapprehensions that it's just not worthy of an answer.
[04:42:12.899 --> 04:42:14.781]  CBS reports the gentleman was there.
[04:42:14.781 --> 04:42:16.222]  We did detain him at the hospital.
[04:42:16.222 --> 04:42:17.403]  He was covered with blood.
[04:42:17.403 --> 04:42:21.806]  We've cleared him of any wrongdoing, but it has been reported he is being deported on charges.
[04:42:21.806 --> 04:42:27.691]  There's been so much reported on this that's been wrong I can't even begin to tell you, Congressman.
[04:42:27.691 --> 04:42:31.514]  We will provide you with accurate information as it becomes available.
[04:42:31.514 --> 04:42:32.255]  I look forward to that.
[04:42:32.255 --> 04:42:32.515]  Thank you.
[04:42:32.515 --> 04:42:33.016]  I yield back.
[04:42:34.935 --> 04:42:35.655]  And there it is.
[04:42:35.655 --> 04:42:37.856]  You saw Miss Napolitano right there.
[04:42:37.856 --> 04:42:40.116]  We will provide you, sir.
[04:42:40.116 --> 04:42:41.437]  Don't get your sources anywhere else.
[04:42:41.437 --> 04:42:44.377]  We will provide you with said information.
[04:42:44.377 --> 04:42:47.298]  The press conference is coming up in 20 minutes.
[04:42:47.298 --> 04:42:48.879]  That's all I can say.
[04:42:48.879 --> 04:42:54.940]  Alex seems very excited about this press conference and we will be giving you live coverage on that.
[04:42:54.940 --> 04:42:58.461]  We'll move now to Cheryl in North Carolina.
[04:42:58.461 --> 04:43:01.042]  Hi, guys.
[04:43:01.042 --> 04:43:01.082]  Hi.
[04:43:03.288 --> 04:43:04.669]  Hi, how are you?
[04:43:04.669 --> 04:43:10.614]  I have to tell you, I'm a newcomer to you guys.
[04:43:10.614 --> 04:43:12.776]  I'm a newcomer to this new way of thinking.
[04:43:12.776 --> 04:43:16.859]  I'm a newcomer in a lot of ways in the last two or three months.
[04:43:16.859 --> 04:43:24.926]  And by nature, I'm a researcher, so when I see something, I need multiple sources to tell me, yeah, this looks pretty legit.
[04:43:24.926 --> 04:43:29.770]  One of the things that caught my attention this morning, saw it on Facebook of all places, was a picture.
[04:43:31.082 --> 04:43:35.304]  Of the principal from Newtown.
[04:43:35.304 --> 04:43:52.053]  Who, and I'm sure you guys have had to have seen this thing, it's a flash picture of her with Newtown and then Fox I think is the supposed, that she was one block away from the bombing yesterday when obviously that could not have happened if she is not with us any longer.
[04:43:52.053 --> 04:43:55.635]  But the conclusion I found is the picture is junk.
[04:43:55.635 --> 04:43:59.377]  It's something somebody has put together for whatever purpose.
[04:44:00.555 --> 04:44:23.491]  My reason for bringing this to your attention is, whoever made this picture, I feel like they're on the good side, you know, they're one of the good guys, but they're too extreme, and when things like this come to light, and then you show, hey, this is inaccurate information, this is not right, nobody has, I couldn't find any news feed on it whatsoever, and it just makes us look like
[04:44:24.639 --> 04:44:28.161]  Well, you gotta keep in mind that, you know, some people do fabricate.
[04:44:28.161 --> 04:44:31.963]  I haven't seen that particular image that you're referring to.
[04:44:31.963 --> 04:44:33.343]  I have heard about it.
[04:44:33.343 --> 04:44:34.824]  I have not seen it myself.
[04:44:34.824 --> 04:44:43.969]  But people do these kind of disinformation things, whether this was somebody who had the right intentions or, you know, media hoax or whatever it was.
[04:44:43.969 --> 04:44:44.829]  Sometimes that's deliberate.
[04:44:44.829 --> 04:44:47.030]  Sometimes that's deliberate by government operatives.
[04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:48.711]  But sometimes people are just aggressive.
[04:44:49.211 --> 04:44:53.134]  Yes, and we have some some secret Alex Jones information.
[04:44:53.134 --> 04:44:56.456]  I'll just talk about like we referenced a couple days ago.
[04:44:56.456 --> 04:45:06.043]  People said that there was a fabricated news clip where Blood and Gore disappeared and we were able to look at the footage and see that was just a bloody rag that was picked up off the ground.
[04:45:06.043 --> 04:45:08.484]  It wasn't a computer glitch or anything like that.
[04:45:08.484 --> 04:45:11.707]  But yes, that is a very, very real concern.
[04:45:11.707 --> 04:45:13.648]  And there is a lot of disinformation out there.
[04:45:13.648 --> 04:45:16.590]  So like you said, you have to get your information from multiple sources.
[04:45:16.650 --> 04:45:25.293]  Well, one of the things that we saw, which again, you know, this explosion that happened up in Waco, there was a report that there was a drill going on at the same time.
[04:45:26.387 --> 04:45:31.091]  When we looked into it, it appeared that the drill was not scheduled for yesterday, but for today.
[04:45:31.091 --> 04:45:36.276]  So that doesn't necessarily mean anything, and the government is not claiming that that was some kind of a terrorist event.
[04:45:36.276 --> 04:45:39.078]  So that doesn't necessarily fit into their narrative.
[04:45:39.078 --> 04:45:46.805]  Although, it's right there where tomorrow is the 20th anniversary of when they burned all those people at the Waco compound.
[04:45:46.805 --> 04:45:49.648]  It's a nice way to keep people away from the Waco compound.
[04:45:49.648 --> 04:45:50.809]  Yeah, so I guess there won't be any...
[04:45:51.390 --> 04:45:54.177]  Commemoration of that, but yeah definitely appreciate your call.
[04:45:54.177 --> 04:45:56.283]  We'll move on to Mike in Louisiana
[04:45:58.945 --> 04:45:59.905]  Yes, hello?
[04:45:59.905 --> 04:46:00.505]  Yes.
[04:46:00.505 --> 04:46:01.286]  Go ahead, Mike.
[04:46:01.286 --> 04:46:02.246]  Yeah.
[04:46:02.246 --> 04:46:06.367]  I, you know, first of all, I want to say that the politicians say yes or no.
[04:46:06.367 --> 04:46:08.487]  That was a very simple question to answer.
[04:46:08.487 --> 04:46:19.830]  Second of all, ever since the, um, mishap at the Superdome, I'm actually from Southeast Louisiana, I decided to take a total of how many black helicopters I've seen daily.
[04:46:19.830 --> 04:46:21.750]  Yesterday was a total of eight.
[04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:25.951]  Yes, yesterday was a total of 18, which is the largest number I've seen to date.
[04:46:26.730 --> 04:46:30.411]  Is there any type of military base or anything where you are?
[04:46:30.411 --> 04:46:37.932]  We do have a joint naval air station, but I mean, this is ridiculously close to my house.
[04:46:37.932 --> 04:46:42.593]  I probably could have thrown a basketball at these guys, you know?
[04:46:42.593 --> 04:46:44.734]  I mean, this is incredible.
[04:46:44.734 --> 04:46:47.034]  Do you have any footage of this?
[04:46:47.034 --> 04:46:49.315]  No, but I'm planning on taking some.
[04:46:49.315 --> 04:46:51.815]  Yeah, take some and put it on YouTube.
[04:46:51.815 --> 04:46:54.796]  I'm afraid that they would shoot me down if I did.
[04:46:55.410 --> 04:46:58.851]  Is there an announced drill in that area?
[04:46:58.851 --> 04:47:04.412]  No, there's a lot of military activity in that section, but there was nothing that was ever announced, no.
[04:47:04.412 --> 04:47:10.693]  There's nothing on TV they tell you, you know, don't be alarmed, this is the newscast, you know, don't worry about the helicopters flying by.
[04:47:10.693 --> 04:47:13.294]  There was no indication this time.
[04:47:13.294 --> 04:47:16.555]  Also, I was wondering if I could make one request of Alex for our old-time listeners.
[04:47:18.379 --> 04:47:20.841]  Could you please do a Cobra Commander impression for me?
[04:47:20.841 --> 04:47:23.143]  He's standing out there, too.
[04:47:23.143 --> 04:47:26.626]  Alright, thanks for your call, Mike.
[04:47:26.626 --> 04:47:28.567]  Cobra currency!
[04:47:28.567 --> 04:47:33.692]  I, Cobra Commander, will protect you from the bombings!
[04:47:33.692 --> 04:47:34.693]  I'm not behind it!
[04:47:34.693 --> 04:47:39.617]  Who would say we would do that to take your freedom, Cobra?
[04:47:39.617 --> 04:47:40.918]  Alright, thank you, Alex.
[04:47:40.918 --> 04:47:45.361]  Alright, and we'll move on to Matt in Oregon.
[04:47:45.361 --> 04:47:46.562]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[04:47:46.562 --> 04:47:47.103]  Good afternoon.
[04:47:47.967 --> 04:47:49.449]  How you doing today?
[04:47:49.449 --> 04:47:49.910]  Very well.
[04:47:49.910 --> 04:48:01.704]  One of them is that the OC in Boston reminds me of the movie The Thomas Crown up there.
[04:48:01.704 --> 04:48:02.565]  I've never seen that movie.
[04:48:02.565 --> 04:48:05.249]  Where he sends all the guys into the museum with bowler hats on.
[04:48:06.324 --> 04:48:14.107]  And they can't figure out who's who and what's going on to throw off any sort of well-meaning individuals?
[04:48:14.107 --> 04:48:16.648]  Exactly the same type of scenario.
[04:48:16.648 --> 04:48:25.431]  But switching gears, the question I had is that someone had brought up on Monday that the New York Times below the fold had talked about an indictment of Obama.
[04:48:26.071 --> 04:48:28.093]  Bush and Clinton of war crimes?
[04:48:28.093 --> 04:48:37.003]  Yes, Dr. Pucinich was talking about that yesterday on the Alex Jones Radio Show and also I referenced it last night on the Infowars Nightly News.
[04:48:37.003 --> 04:48:37.944]  I don't know if we have that article.
[04:48:37.944 --> 04:48:41.468]  I believe it was taken down but it was reposted on Prison Planet.
[04:48:41.468 --> 04:48:46.313]  So you can go to the archives at PrisonPlanet.tv or also on YouTube and look at some of the
[04:48:46.934 --> 04:48:51.480]  It was a bipartisan commission and they produced a 600 page report.
[04:48:51.480 --> 04:48:56.808]  They had a one hour presentation video of their results and what they did was they indicted
[04:48:57.754 --> 04:49:08.561]  The Bush administration, the Obama administration, even going back to the Bill Clinton administration, talking about essentially war crimes planned at the highest levels of our government.
[04:49:08.561 --> 04:49:16.966]  And it has some nice quotes in there from guys like Dick Cheney and Pelosi saying, oh yeah, we love exaggerated or, what's the term?
[04:49:16.966 --> 04:49:18.066]  Extraordinary rendition?
[04:49:18.066 --> 04:49:19.287]  Yeah, something like that.
[04:49:19.287 --> 04:49:20.508]  So definitely check that out.
[04:49:20.508 --> 04:49:25.251]  You can find those interviews with Dr. Steve Pichinik on the Alex Jones YouTube page.
[04:49:25.251 --> 04:49:27.172]  We'll move on now to Marcus in Texas.
[04:49:30.831 --> 04:49:32.972]  Hello, Marcus.
[04:49:32.972 --> 04:49:34.453]  Hi, this is Chris in Texas.
[04:49:34.453 --> 04:49:34.873]  Oh, Chris.
[04:49:34.873 --> 04:49:37.374]  Okay, go ahead.
[04:49:37.374 --> 04:49:37.754]  Yes, sir.
[04:49:37.754 --> 04:49:40.636]  I want to say you guys are doing a tremendously awesome job.
[04:49:40.636 --> 04:49:42.877]  I really appreciate all your guys' hard work.
[04:49:42.877 --> 04:49:43.477]  Thank you.
[04:49:43.477 --> 04:49:52.501]  And kind of off-subject, but have you guys heard about this Armed Peaceful March that's supposed to take place in Washington, D.C.
[04:49:52.501 --> 04:49:53.802]  on July 4th?
[04:49:53.802 --> 04:49:54.803]  No, I have not.
[04:49:54.803 --> 04:49:55.463]  Fill us in on that.
[04:49:56.528 --> 04:50:02.492]  Okay, uh, there's a group called, uh, Prepare to Take America Back on Facebook.
[04:50:02.492 --> 04:50:03.012]  Okay.
[04:50:03.012 --> 04:50:09.236]  And, uh, apparently they are organizing this, uh, armed peaceful march on Washington, D.C.
[04:50:09.236 --> 04:50:11.358]  on July 4th.
[04:50:11.358 --> 04:50:18.502]  And, uh, they haven't really put out a lot of details, but they do have an event scheduled, so that may be something y'all want to check into.
[04:50:18.502 --> 04:50:22.225]  And, uh, just your thoughts on whether it'd be a good idea or not.
[04:50:22.941 --> 04:50:23.241]  I don't
[04:50:40.584 --> 04:50:41.664]  A rally tomorrow.
[04:50:41.664 --> 04:50:57.890]  I don't know if you've been following the news here, but Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers was scheduled, as they have in the past several years, to have a rally on Lexington Green to commemorate the anniversary of the British coming in to seize the guns with the Oath Keepers.
[04:50:57.890 --> 04:51:03.593]  And it's always been a very peaceful rally of veterans and speeches and that sort of thing.
[04:51:03.593 --> 04:51:04.313]  And they had their
[04:51:04.693 --> 04:51:05.234]  The Facebook group.
[04:51:27.028 --> 04:51:27.328]  Yes.
[04:51:27.328 --> 04:51:27.788]  Okay.
[04:51:27.788 --> 04:51:28.409]  We'll look into that.
[04:51:28.409 --> 04:51:29.309]  Thank you, sir.
[04:51:29.309 --> 04:51:33.252]  The number to call in is 877-789-ALEX.
[04:51:33.252 --> 04:51:35.913]  That is 877-789-2539.
[04:51:35.913 --> 04:51:39.836]  We're just about 10 minutes away from the press conference.
[04:51:39.836 --> 04:51:44.178]  So we'll finish with Tony, and then I believe it's, is it Danny in Illinois?
[04:51:44.178 --> 04:51:47.120]  And then we'll show a video and come back with the press conference.
[04:51:47.120 --> 04:51:48.521]  So Tony, go ahead.
[04:51:48.521 --> 04:51:50.022]  Tony in Pennsylvania.
[04:51:50.022 --> 04:51:51.603]  Hey, how are you guys doing today?
[04:51:51.603 --> 04:51:52.003]  Very well.
[04:51:53.311 --> 04:51:54.552]  Good.
[04:51:54.552 --> 04:51:57.593]  We need to beat this indictment like a dead horse.
[04:51:57.593 --> 04:52:05.256]  In all honesty, I think this is going to be the Hail Mary that brings these guys down.
[04:52:05.256 --> 04:52:09.758]  So we really need to beat this indictment like a dead horse.
[04:52:09.758 --> 04:52:10.918]  I can't stress that enough.
[04:52:10.918 --> 04:52:14.100]  We need to talk about this more than anything I would imagine.
[04:52:15.077 --> 04:52:16.999]  Can you guys see if you can find that arc?
[04:52:16.999 --> 04:52:19.301]  I know it was pulled down, but if you can find it, that would be good.
[04:52:19.301 --> 04:52:19.501]  Go ahead.
[04:52:19.501 --> 04:52:30.050]  One of the things that Pachinik was talking about, and also I would recommend anybody that wants information about this, there is a article at the New York Times called Gitmo is Killing Me.
[04:52:30.670 --> 04:52:43.903]  And if you want to see what our future is going to be like under the kind of NDAA world that Lindsey Graham and John McCain and Carl Levin want to institute here and Obama want to institute here, take a look at that.
[04:52:43.903 --> 04:52:45.164]  Because people who will do that
[04:52:45.845 --> 04:52:49.089]  To someone who is not an American citizen.
[04:52:49.089 --> 04:52:50.430]  We'll do that to an American citizen.
[04:53:05.288 --> 04:53:06.188]  I do have one more question.
[04:53:06.188 --> 04:53:07.829]  What is the possibility of this event going through?
[04:53:07.829 --> 04:53:10.230]  Are they going to weasel their way out of this one, you think?
[04:53:27.458 --> 04:53:32.682]  Well, this group doesn't have... I don't know that this group has any legal clout to do this.
[04:53:32.682 --> 04:53:39.546]  Basically, what they did was they conducted a very long investigation of these three administrations, and they put their data out there.
[04:53:39.546 --> 04:53:42.608]  But I don't think that they're anything like a grand jury.
[04:53:42.608 --> 04:53:44.730]  They don't have any kind of indictment powers.
[04:53:44.730 --> 04:53:47.352]  I mean, they've indicted them in a somewhat symbolic way.
[04:53:47.352 --> 04:53:48.893]  Like in the public perception.
[04:53:48.893 --> 04:53:54.637]  But Pchenik was saying that it was very significant in his mind that this would even go through, because to him,
[04:53:55.337 --> 04:54:04.242]  It appeared that important people were withdrawing their support from Obama and kind of leaving him hanging out there to dry.
[04:54:04.242 --> 04:54:06.183]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[04:54:06.183 --> 04:54:09.645]  Yeah, but definitely inform your friends and family of that one, sir.
[04:54:09.645 --> 04:54:11.526]  And our last call, Dan in Illinois.
[04:54:14.565 --> 04:54:14.745]  I don't
[04:54:30.201 --> 04:54:38.282]  Our law enforcement, our military, our militias losing their right to own arms because you see they've taken oath to the Constitution.
[04:54:38.282 --> 04:54:40.683]  Okay, so the Constitution applies to them.
[04:54:40.683 --> 04:54:42.343]  This does not apply to the public.
[04:54:42.343 --> 04:54:43.863]  We have a DIC Act.
[04:54:43.863 --> 04:54:46.844]  Okay, we have our Bill of Rights, first and foremost.
[04:54:46.844 --> 04:54:49.084]  We have our God-given rights.
[04:54:49.084 --> 04:54:54.485]  We don't need permission if they're going to take away the Second Amendment, whatever they're going to say.
[04:54:54.485 --> 04:54:56.246]  These are a set of rules.
[04:54:56.246 --> 04:54:58.026]  Our Constitution is a rule book.
[04:54:58.286 --> 04:54:59.547]  Hey Dan, can you just hold on one second?
[04:54:59.547 --> 04:55:00.908]  I just want to talk to the guys for one second.
[04:55:00.908 --> 04:55:01.988]  Can we get the clip?
[04:55:01.988 --> 04:55:06.271]  MSNBC host blames NRA for law enforcement inability at Boston.
[04:55:06.271 --> 04:55:07.692]  If we can go out to break on that one.
[04:55:07.692 --> 04:55:09.633]  But go ahead Dan, finish your point.
[04:55:09.633 --> 04:55:13.875]  So my point is, everybody's worried about this Constitution stuff.
[04:55:13.875 --> 04:55:18.318]  I'm worried about it because, you know, people are getting blindsided.
[04:55:18.318 --> 04:55:23.361]  The Constitution is rules and regulations for our law enforcement, our military.
[04:55:23.361 --> 04:55:23.701]  That's right.
[04:55:23.701 --> 04:55:26.163]  Our law enforcement and our military need to be armed.
[04:55:27.063 --> 04:55:29.184]  Okay, and that's who this applies to.
[04:55:29.184 --> 04:55:30.885]  Not the people.
[04:55:30.885 --> 04:55:33.126]  You can't disarm the public.
[04:55:33.126 --> 04:55:34.266]  We are the public.
[04:55:34.266 --> 04:55:35.627]  They are the servants.
[04:55:35.627 --> 04:55:42.870]  And if you look at Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, it clearly identifies the militia as being the core of our defense.
[04:55:42.870 --> 04:55:45.631]  Permanent standing armies were only to be funded for two years at a time.
[04:55:48.872 --> 04:55:54.358]  But, you know, when they talk about 90% of the people supported their legislation, well, I don't know where they got that figure, but you know what?
[04:55:54.358 --> 04:56:01.286]  It doesn't matter if 90% of the people got it, because as Jefferson said, a democracy is where 51% of the people take away the rights of the other 49%.
[04:56:03.889 --> 04:56:06.050]  And is she voting for what's within her, yeah?
[04:56:06.050 --> 04:56:06.690]  That's right.
[04:56:06.690 --> 04:56:11.512]  We have the Constitution, we have that rule of law there because, and they swear allegiance to it.
[04:56:11.512 --> 04:56:16.554]  And they are essentially temporary stewards who are swearing allegiance to the king of the land.
[04:56:16.554 --> 04:56:18.455]  And that king is a law.
[04:56:18.455 --> 04:56:21.096]  What they said at the Colonial Times, Lex Rex.
[04:56:21.096 --> 04:56:23.057]  That's Latin for the law is king.
[04:56:23.057 --> 04:56:25.038]  And that's what they're swearing allegiance to.
[04:56:25.038 --> 04:56:32.121]  And when they do anything to undermine that, they're basically not only committing, they're unfaithful stewards and they're committing treason.
[04:56:32.681 --> 04:56:33.461]  Alright, thank you for your call.
[04:56:33.461 --> 04:56:34.642]  We have to go to break.
[04:56:34.642 --> 04:56:37.943]  We'll be back with the press conference and then more of your calls.
[04:56:37.943 --> 04:56:41.143]  The number to call in is 877-789-ALEX.
[04:56:41.143 --> 04:56:41.544]  That is 877-789-2539.
[04:56:41.544 --> 04:56:47.125]  But remember, we're going to start with the press conference back on the other side.
[04:56:47.125 --> 04:56:49.846]  So guys, roll to the video whenever you're ready.
[04:56:50.592 --> 04:56:56.420]  Today, the gun lobbyists at the NRA got what they wanted on the floor of the United States Senate.
[04:56:56.420 --> 04:57:05.213]  And tonight, lobbyists from the NRA have made it harder for the FBI to find the murderer who planted the bombs here in Boston.
[04:57:07.702 --> 04:57:11.065]  The investigation into Monday's bombing in Boston intensifies.
[04:57:11.065 --> 04:57:13.807]  There's a lot of information flying around right now.
[04:57:13.807 --> 04:57:15.388]  We've heard conflicting information.
[04:57:15.388 --> 04:57:19.972]  Various media accounts right now as to whether or not someone is in custody.
[04:57:19.972 --> 04:57:22.114]  A suspect is about to be arrested.
[04:57:22.114 --> 04:57:24.095]  I've just been told that an arrest has been made.
[04:57:24.095 --> 04:57:27.598]  We are just not comfortable at this hour reporting that.
[04:57:27.598 --> 04:57:30.901]  Several law enforcement sources tell us that has not happened.
[04:57:30.901 --> 04:57:32.562]  All of our sources say no arrest.
[04:57:32.942 --> 04:57:36.464]  On the record, there's been no arrest in the Boston bombings case.
[04:57:36.464 --> 04:57:37.905]  Here is what we actually know.
[04:57:37.905 --> 04:57:41.468]  Investigators have identified solid leads from video evidence.
[04:57:41.468 --> 04:57:46.131]  Investigators have obtained surveillance video specifically from a department store.
[04:57:46.131 --> 04:57:49.433]  The person placing a black bag down near the scene of the blast.
[04:57:49.793 --> 04:57:53.014]  At the same time, as you've heard, they're piecing together the bomb parts.
[04:57:53.014 --> 04:57:54.595]  It's a very promising lead.
[04:57:54.595 --> 04:57:56.275]  They're tracking where they were purchased.
[04:57:56.275 --> 04:57:59.236]  The investigation is accelerating pretty rapidly.
[04:57:59.236 --> 04:58:03.037]  What happened to us the other day will not cow us, it will not change us.
[04:58:03.037 --> 04:58:07.319]  What happened the other day was not just an attack against Boston, it was an attack against all of us.
[04:58:14.651 --> 04:58:26.534]  There are new developments tonight in the bombing investigation here in Boston, but that investigation could be moving faster were it not for the successful lobbying efforts of the National Rifle Association.
[04:58:26.534 --> 04:58:38.656]  The NRA's effort to guarantee that American mass murderers are the best equipped mass murderers in the world is not limited to murderers who use assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
[04:58:38.656 --> 04:58:42.877]  The NRA is also in the business of helping bombers
[04:58:43.537 --> 04:58:45.519]  Get away with their crimes.
[04:58:45.519 --> 04:58:57.608]  Gunpowder could be traced by investigators to a buyer at the point of sale if gunpowder contained a tagant, an element that would enable tracing of the purchase of gunpowder.
[04:58:57.608 --> 04:59:04.613]  But thanks to the National Rifle Association, identification tagants are required by law only.
[04:59:05.277 --> 04:59:07.078]  In plastic explosives.
[04:59:07.078 --> 04:59:13.980]  The NRA has successfully blocked any requirements for such tagants in gunpowder.
[04:59:13.980 --> 04:59:21.703]  So such supremely helpful evidence as tagants are not available to the FBI in this investigation.
[04:59:22.203 --> 04:59:27.265]  The FBI tells NBC News it is following some promising leads.
[04:59:27.265 --> 04:59:39.009]  One in particular, video and images collected by authorities showing someone carrying a heavy backpack or duffel bag and placing it at the spot where the second bomb went off.
[04:59:39.796 --> 04:59:47.399]  Key evidence is also being obtained from footage captured by a security camera above one of the bomb sites.
[04:59:47.399 --> 04:59:53.801]  That camera was on the top of the Lord & Taylor department store on Boylston Street, just over here, one block away.
[04:59:53.801 --> 04:59:59.763]  Despite conflicting reports today in the media, none of which originated from this network,
[05:00:00.383 --> 05:00:05.607]  There has been no arrest of any individual or individuals at this time.
[05:00:05.607 --> 05:00:09.451]  The FBI and Boston Police are calling for restraint.
[05:00:11.101 --> 05:00:14.523]  All right, and welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show, Serious Overdrive.
[05:00:14.523 --> 05:00:16.385]  Myself and David Knight.
[05:00:16.385 --> 05:00:22.208]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV or Infowars.com forward slash listen, we definitely appreciate your presence.
[05:00:22.208 --> 05:00:26.771]  Now we will be covering a press conference here in a few moments.
[05:00:26.771 --> 05:00:28.753]  Guys, just let us know when that's up and ready.
[05:00:28.753 --> 05:00:31.134]  But in the meantime, we can take a couple more calls.
[05:00:31.134 --> 05:00:32.395]  The number to call in is 877-789-ALEX.
[05:00:32.395 --> 05:00:32.715]  That is 877-789-2539.
[05:00:32.715 --> 05:00:33.836]  And before we go to the calls,
[05:00:40.120 --> 05:00:41.720]  David, do you have any thoughts?
[05:00:41.720 --> 05:00:51.363]  Yeah, today is Tax Freedom Day, so just think about that New Year's Eve party that you're at, and think about all the days that you've worked between then and now.
[05:00:51.363 --> 05:00:52.963]  That all goes to the government.
[05:00:52.963 --> 05:00:59.004]  Unless you live in New York, California, New Jersey, or Illinois, in which case, you're still working for the government.
[05:00:59.004 --> 05:01:00.245]  Right, okay.
[05:01:00.245 --> 05:01:01.905]  We do have the press conference, so let's go to that.
[05:01:04.298 --> 05:01:06.240]  Alex, I like this one from the National Review Online.
[05:01:06.240 --> 05:01:07.140]  Feinstein, show some guts!
[05:01:33.482 --> 05:01:37.944]  This is Feinstein, I believe after the bill was struck down in the Senate.
[05:01:37.944 --> 05:01:41.945]  She says, I am really chagrined and concerned.
[05:01:41.945 --> 05:01:52.509]  If anybody cares, vote to at least prospectively ban the manufacture, the sale, the importation of military-style assault weapons, she said in remarks on the Senate floor.
[05:01:52.509 --> 05:01:53.089]  That's right.
[05:01:53.089 --> 05:01:54.089]  Have some guts.
[05:01:54.089 --> 05:01:55.730]  Man up and destroy the Constitution.
[05:01:56.090 --> 05:01:57.271]  Are you afraid of that law?
[05:02:11.747 --> 05:02:23.235]  Destroy the Second Amendment and putting registration unconstitutional Requirements on things and trying to turn what is a fundamental right into a government-granted privilege But now is not the time to rest on your laurels.
[05:02:23.235 --> 05:02:41.247]  We have the CISPA Bill has already been passed by the House of Representatives it passed by a large margin 288 to 127 and it is going before the Senate they're moving pretty quickly on this and This is something that is
[05:02:42.169 --> 05:02:48.564]  And direct conflict with the Fourth Amendment to be secure in your privacy and your person in your home and house.
[05:02:49.662 --> 05:02:59.528]  If we're going to allow them to destroy our freedoms in the virtual world, they will destroy our freedoms in the physical world as well, just like they are doing at the airport and many other ways.
[05:02:59.528 --> 05:03:01.670]  And look at some of the things that were said on this.
[05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:11.776]  We had a Representative Rogers, who's a Republican from Michigan, and he called anybody who opposed this a teenage basement tweeter.
[05:03:12.566 --> 05:03:23.468]  And he was saying that all the corporations were in support of this, but there's many internet companies, and here's a list of them, that we get from the ElectronicFreedomFoundation.org, that's EFF.org.
[05:03:23.468 --> 05:03:29.790]  They said Mozilla, Reddit, Namecheap, GondiNet, others have come out strongly against the bill.
[05:03:29.790 --> 05:03:34.231]  70 cybersecurity experts and academics sent a joint letter opposing it.
[05:03:34.231 --> 05:03:38.472]  There are 34 civil liberties groups that have sent a letter opposing CISPA in its current form.
[05:03:39.292 --> 05:03:42.194]  And listen to this incredible thing that was said by Rogers.
[05:03:42.194 --> 05:03:46.436]  He said, all we're talking about here is zeros and ones.
[05:03:46.436 --> 05:03:49.057]  Hundreds of millions of times a second in patterns.
[05:03:49.057 --> 05:03:51.038]  It has nothing to do with content.
[05:03:51.038 --> 05:03:51.959]  Nothing.
[05:03:51.959 --> 05:03:56.561]  I mean, that is so profoundly... Does that guy think that we are blithering idiots?
[05:03:56.561 --> 05:03:57.502]  Or is he a blithering idiot?
[05:03:57.802 --> 05:04:00.583]  I mean, that is the most profoundly ignorant thing I've ever seen.
[05:04:00.583 --> 05:04:04.785]  Of course, all digital communication is a series of ones and zeros.
[05:04:04.785 --> 05:04:06.446]  And that's how you constitute the content.
[05:04:06.446 --> 05:04:18.752]  I mean, that is just mind-boggling that he would make that kind of a statement, as well as disparaging anybody who disagrees with the idea that the Fourth Amendment is sacrosanct and needs to be respected, just like the other ones.
[05:04:18.752 --> 05:04:21.734]  And this is where we need to break this left-right paradigm.
[05:04:22.674 --> 05:04:34.602]  For so long, the left has cared about civil liberties issues, but disparaged the Second Amendment, and the right basically would care about the Second Amendment and disparage civil liberties, or kind of ignore them.
[05:04:34.602 --> 05:04:39.165]  We need to get the same people who harangued the Senate to do the right thing.
[05:04:39.165 --> 05:04:40.987]  We need to get them on the senators and say,
[05:04:41.647 --> 05:04:43.287]  We don't just want the Second Amendment.
[05:04:43.287 --> 05:04:44.428]  We want the Fourth Amendment.
[05:04:44.428 --> 05:04:45.568]  We want the Sixth Amendment.
[05:04:45.568 --> 05:04:46.208]  We want all of them.
[05:04:46.208 --> 05:04:46.788]  The First Amendment.
[05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:47.149]  Exactly.
[05:04:47.149 --> 05:04:48.089]  We want all of these things.
[05:04:48.089 --> 05:04:52.970]  So get on, you know, tell people on Facebook to get on to the Senators.
[05:04:52.970 --> 05:04:56.531]  Everybody give them a call and let them know because time is very short.
[05:04:56.531 --> 05:04:57.291]  That's very important.
[05:04:57.291 --> 05:05:02.693]  This is a good time, especially the people who are internet savvy and, you know, use it quite frequently.
[05:05:02.693 --> 05:05:04.653]  This concerns you a great deal.
[05:05:04.653 --> 05:05:09.094]  It's not just about, you know, hacking the new Iron Man movie or whatever else.
[05:05:09.094 --> 05:05:10.935]  Use those ones and zeros to inform each other.
[05:05:11.175 --> 05:05:16.802]  Yeah, use those ones and zeros to inform each other like you write your friends all day on Twitter and Facebook.
[05:05:16.802 --> 05:05:17.963]  Write your congressman.
[05:05:17.963 --> 05:05:19.205]  Write your senator.
[05:05:19.205 --> 05:05:27.174]  Write people who can actually do things about this and say, hey, I'm a supporter of you, or at least I could potentially support you if you support getting this out of here.
[05:05:27.174 --> 05:05:29.056]  So definitely keep that in mind.
[05:05:29.056 --> 05:05:30.978]  I'll just mention briefly the new Iron Man movie.
[05:05:32.011 --> 05:05:33.712]  I saw this on Drudge yesterday.
[05:05:33.712 --> 05:05:35.454]  They have Smell-O-Vision now.
[05:05:35.454 --> 05:05:37.335]  Did you see that?
[05:05:37.335 --> 05:05:38.677]  No thanks.
[05:05:38.677 --> 05:05:41.939]  Yeah, it's Smell-O-Vision so you can smell Robert Downey Jr.'
[05:05:41.919 --> 05:05:44.041]  's sweaty armpits in Iron Man.
[05:05:44.041 --> 05:05:45.602]  They call it 4D.
[05:05:45.602 --> 05:05:45.963]  Oh, great.
[05:05:45.963 --> 05:05:47.764]  So you have smell now in your movies.
[05:05:47.764 --> 05:05:48.304]  Great.
[05:05:48.304 --> 05:05:52.268]  I think that's going to be an even bigger flop in the theaters than 3D is turning out to be.
[05:05:52.268 --> 05:05:52.828]  Oh my gosh.
[05:05:52.828 --> 05:05:54.850]  We need to focus on content.
[05:05:54.850 --> 05:05:56.311]  Yeah, that's way off topic.
[05:05:56.311 --> 05:05:58.052]  Where are we in the press conference?
[05:05:58.052 --> 05:06:00.374]  Are we about to start or still waiting?
[05:06:02.620 --> 05:06:06.403]  Okay, yeah, yeah, we'll keep that cat in the bag for right now.
[05:06:06.403 --> 05:06:09.326]  Alright, so let's start with, take some calls.
[05:06:09.326 --> 05:06:14.370]  We'll start with Dan, not Dan, excuse me, Brad in Michigan.
[05:06:14.370 --> 05:06:15.731]  How you guys doing today?
[05:06:15.731 --> 05:06:17.513]  Very well, very well.
[05:06:17.513 --> 05:06:20.675]  I'm a first time caller, but I'm a listener for life.
[05:06:20.675 --> 05:06:22.677]  Oh, thank you.
[05:06:22.677 --> 05:06:29.463]  I just wanted to talk about the incidences that have been happening in the past week or so.
[05:06:30.496 --> 05:06:41.127]  And I remember you guys had, or Alex Jones had his son on there and he was talking about how they destabilized the regions over in the Middle East.
[05:06:41.127 --> 05:06:47.534]  And I was just curious, is that something that could, I have this feeling that it's going to be coming this way.
[05:06:52.381 --> 05:06:54.963]  Just look at some of the news that was breaking in the last couple of days.
[05:06:54.963 --> 05:07:06.611]  There was an article on Drudge Report where they were saying, it was essentially the Syrian president saying, you guys are using Al-Qaeda and Al-Qaeda is going to come back to bite you in America and bite you in Western Europe and everything.
[05:07:06.611 --> 05:07:09.733]  And it's like, hey, and he pointed out and this is, you know,
[05:07:10.413 --> 05:07:11.954]  All the people are talking about this.
[05:07:11.954 --> 05:07:14.317]  He pointed out that the U.S.
[05:07:14.317 --> 05:07:19.041]  created Al-Qaeda to go against the Russians.
[05:07:19.041 --> 05:07:22.383]  But the question is, were they ever not in control of that?
[05:07:22.383 --> 05:07:23.564]  That's really the question.
[05:07:23.564 --> 05:07:24.785]  We know they created them.
[05:07:24.785 --> 05:07:27.087]  We know that they used them to overthrow Libya.
[05:07:27.087 --> 05:07:36.135]  We know that they're using them in Syria, that they're sending money to them, even though we are supposedly, and we truly are, in dire straits as far as money goes, as far as the sequester goes.
[05:07:36.135 --> 05:07:36.836]  We are broke.
[05:07:37.276 --> 05:07:46.286]  And we're printing money and borrowing money from the Federal Reserve Banks and paying them tremendous amounts of interest so that we can send that money then to Al Qaeda.
[05:07:46.286 --> 05:07:49.009]  It's absolutely an insane foreign policy.
[05:07:49.423 --> 05:07:55.228]  And just look at Al-Qaeda, the Free Syrian Army, as they are referred to in Syria.
[05:07:55.228 --> 05:08:06.938]  They're recruiting children who are playing with dynamite, and AK-47 Syrian Girl has been on here talking about how the Syrian Army is raping people, the Free Syrian Army is raping young women and young girls even.
[05:08:06.938 --> 05:08:08.440]  They're beating up old men in the streets.
[05:08:08.440 --> 05:08:13.124]  You can find all that stuff on Syrian Girl's partisan channel, I believe it's called, on YouTube.
[05:08:13.124 --> 05:08:13.784]  And I gotta say,
[05:08:14.685 --> 05:08:24.532]  We looked at this press conference, not a press conference, but Representative Duncan questioning Janet Napolitano about this Saudi person of interest.
[05:08:24.532 --> 05:08:29.895]  And when I first heard that, you know, the reports were that they grabbed a Saudi guy because he was running.
[05:08:29.895 --> 05:08:31.796]  And of course, everybody was doing that.
[05:08:31.796 --> 05:08:34.018]  And I thought, well, they're just single this guy out because he's Arab.
[05:08:34.676 --> 05:08:39.540]  But then the fact that they would deport him, I find that to be the most suspicious thing about it.
[05:08:39.540 --> 05:08:40.400]  Yeah, get him out of here.
[05:08:40.400 --> 05:08:48.526]  We know that it was Saudis that they used as the narrative for 9-11, you know, whatever their involvement was.
[05:08:48.526 --> 05:09:03.918]  Of course, we know they found all their passports immediately afterwards, some of them laying on top of the heap, so they... Yeah, that's very... But, you know, there's been this kind of connection in the past, just as there has been with Al-Qaeda, and so I find that to be even more suspicious than the initial reports.
[05:09:04.278 --> 05:09:05.719]  All right, and thank you for your call, Brad.
[05:09:05.719 --> 05:09:08.681]  We'll take calls until the press conference starts.
[05:09:08.681 --> 05:09:11.623]  We'll go to Chris in California.
[05:09:11.623 --> 05:09:12.823]  Hey, how are you guys doing today?
[05:09:12.823 --> 05:09:13.284]  Very well.
[05:09:13.284 --> 05:09:15.825]  Just a quick question.
[05:09:15.825 --> 05:09:22.970]  I don't know if you guys have a look at YouTube about Charlie Chaplin.
[05:09:22.970 --> 05:09:23.910]  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
[05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:25.732]  Can you get a little closer to your phone?
[05:09:25.732 --> 05:09:27.713]  Oh, yeah.
[05:09:27.713 --> 05:09:29.134]  Charlie Chaplin.
[05:09:29.134 --> 05:09:30.355]  I don't know if you guys
[05:09:31.508 --> 05:09:36.530]  Watched his video on YouTube, Message to Humanity.
[05:09:36.530 --> 05:09:38.712]  Are you talking about the original Charlie Chaplin?
[05:09:38.712 --> 05:09:40.352]  Or is this somebody new?
[05:09:40.352 --> 05:09:46.315]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not really too sure if it's somebody new or if it's somebody original.
[05:09:46.315 --> 05:09:51.338]  But there's a video on YouTube, Message to Humanity, and it's a pretty good video.
[05:09:51.338 --> 05:09:54.299]  I don't know if you guys ever looked at it or maybe someone else has.
[05:09:54.299 --> 05:09:54.919]  No, I haven't seen it.
[05:09:54.919 --> 05:09:55.860]  What's the video about?
[05:09:55.860 --> 05:09:59.962]  It's just talking about how he doesn't want to be a dictator.
[05:10:00.954 --> 05:10:06.158]  And he wants people to wake up from all the chaos and corruption that's going on in the world.
[05:10:06.158 --> 05:10:09.561]  That's about a 3 minute and 30 second clip.
[05:10:09.561 --> 05:10:10.281]  Okay.
[05:10:10.281 --> 05:10:13.624]  And you said it's, uh, can you tell us the title one more time?
[05:10:13.624 --> 05:10:17.787]  Uh, Charlie, Charlie Chaplin, uh, Message to United.
[05:10:17.787 --> 05:10:18.047]  Okay.
[05:10:18.047 --> 05:10:18.948]  Thank you for your call, Chris.
[05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:23.131]  We're gonna move on to Sam in Ohio.
[05:10:23.131 --> 05:10:24.111]  How you doing?
[05:10:24.111 --> 05:10:24.712]  Doing very well.
[05:10:25.666 --> 05:10:26.647]  Good.
[05:10:26.647 --> 05:10:37.815]  I was calling in to make sure people were informed of the Act of 1871, which turned the United States into a corporation.
[05:10:37.815 --> 05:10:41.458]  Two constitutions now are in place.
[05:10:41.458 --> 05:10:45.841]  The Organic Constitution and the Corporate Constitution.
[05:10:45.841 --> 05:10:50.365]  You said the Act of 1871?
[05:10:50.365 --> 05:10:51.025]  Yes, sir.
[05:10:51.025 --> 05:10:51.466]  Okay, go ahead.
[05:10:52.638 --> 05:11:05.308]  And this is very important because with the Act of 1871, the corporate constitution is operating in private international law.
[05:11:05.308 --> 05:11:13.274]  Our original organic constitution was not to operate in private international law.
[05:11:13.274 --> 05:11:17.417]  So I just wanted to put that up out there so people can check that out themselves.
[05:11:18.246 --> 05:11:22.030]  I feel that it's very important for all Americans to know the truth.
[05:11:22.030 --> 05:11:36.423]  Well, we certainly have the narrative that we've heard over and over again about the Constitution being a living document, that they're not bound to it, and now we have a lot of people coming out and just saying, well, let's get rid of the Second Amendment, let's get rid of the Constitution, let's not be bound by it.
[05:11:36.423 --> 05:11:41.808]  You know, we need to make sure that the Constitution is being obeyed.
[05:11:42.617 --> 05:11:43.057]  Exactly.
[05:11:43.057 --> 05:11:57.183]  And a good example of what she's talking about is that movie Network, where I do believe we may have that audio clip where Mr. Howard Beale is getting the lecture about there is no United States, there is no Canada, there's only IBM and AT&T and this and that.
[05:11:57.183 --> 05:12:01.725]  And that's a very real, very true statement in that film, that film Network.
[05:12:01.725 --> 05:12:02.245]  Yeah.
[05:12:02.245 --> 05:12:02.825]  OK, we'll move on.
[05:12:02.825 --> 05:12:03.625]  Thank you for your call, Sam.
[05:12:03.625 --> 05:12:07.327]  We'll move on to Dennis in Colorado.
[05:12:07.327 --> 05:12:08.007]  Hello?
[05:12:08.007 --> 05:12:08.267]  Hello.
[05:12:08.267 --> 05:12:10.108]  Are you there?
[05:12:10.108 --> 05:12:11.148]  Yes.
[05:12:11.148 --> 05:12:11.369]  Are you?
[05:12:13.055 --> 05:12:15.397]  Yes, go ahead, what's your call?
[05:12:15.397 --> 05:12:20.581]  Uh, well, you know, this stuff's been going on for years.
[05:12:20.581 --> 05:12:35.033]  I mean, even from Vietnam, you know, when they say they don't do landmines no more, they drop these baseball-sized things and pop up and kill people, you know, and the government's been in a lot of conspiracy.
[05:12:35.033 --> 05:12:35.334]  Absolutely.
[05:12:35.334 --> 05:12:40.438]  So this isn't the first time this has happened in Boston or Waco or wherever.
[05:12:41.161 --> 05:12:56.181]  And if you go back, you can probably find it online if you don't have a physical copy of it, but the very first InfoWars magazine, Kurt Nimmo wrote a very good article about the history of false flags, and he basically took it up to about the time of the Vietnam War.
[05:12:56.821 --> 05:13:11.244]  There were a ton of false flag incidents there, all of which have now been declassified, things like Operation Gladio and Northwoods, those sorts of things, as well as the Gulf of Tonkin, exactly.
[05:13:11.244 --> 05:13:17.685]  But there have been a lot more since then, and so we're going to be updating that article.
[05:13:17.685 --> 05:13:19.906]  Watch for that.
[05:13:19.906 --> 05:13:21.066]  All right, thank you for your call.
[05:13:21.066 --> 05:13:24.227]  Moving back to Bruce in Canada.
[05:13:24.227 --> 05:13:24.867]  Hello?
[05:13:24.867 --> 05:13:25.027]  Yes.
[05:13:25.831 --> 05:13:27.853]  Oh hey, how do I sound now?
[05:13:27.853 --> 05:13:29.755]  You do sound much better, go ahead.
[05:13:29.755 --> 05:13:30.696]  Excellent, excellent.
[05:13:30.696 --> 05:13:34.600]  Let's just cut right to the jib here then, gentlemen.
[05:13:34.600 --> 05:13:47.914]  Last week, exactly one week ago today, three days before the bombing, the government re-released a tape where Adam Gadon, the grandson of the ADL, called for lone wolf attacks to cause mass casualties using whatever means obtainable.
[05:13:48.781 --> 05:13:55.125]  MSNBC show Morning Joe ran text on screen three days before the attack on April 11th.
[05:13:55.125 --> 05:13:59.447]  The text on screen said video draws attention to potential terror threat.
[05:14:01.128 --> 05:14:04.970]  Can you give us the date?
[05:14:04.970 --> 05:14:12.693]  Adam got on and he said you could go arm yourself with a fully automatic weapon at a gun show with no paperwork in the video.
[05:14:12.693 --> 05:14:15.894]  A total lie, but it's extremely convenient, wouldn't you say?
[05:14:15.894 --> 05:14:18.915]  I mean, the other boogeymen are dead after all.
[05:14:18.915 --> 05:14:25.538]  You can't say ol' Anwar al-Laki, the CIA lackey, was the bomber's handler anymore, like he did in Times Square.
[05:14:26.309 --> 05:14:28.991]  Or you did at Fort Hood, right?
[05:14:28.991 --> 05:14:35.137]  Osama Bin Goldstein can't rise from the grave to help Obama politically like he did with Bush.
[05:14:35.137 --> 05:14:40.962]  Conveniently, Adam was linked to Fort Hood shooting before they killed the last guy with the Predator drone.
[05:14:40.962 --> 05:14:43.244]  And who released the tape days before the bomb?
[05:14:43.985 --> 05:14:45.266]  You know, the government.
[05:14:45.266 --> 05:14:49.508]  Who's desperate to link the Tea Party and Libertarians with terrorist groups?
[05:14:49.508 --> 05:14:50.609]  The government.
[05:14:50.609 --> 05:14:55.252]  So let's blow a hole in what their official narrative would have been days ago.
[05:14:55.252 --> 05:14:58.234]  You know, let's stand in front of, like, this is incredible.
[05:14:58.234 --> 05:15:02.677]  Lots of publications already saying it was some Patriot-type fellow.
[05:15:02.677 --> 05:15:05.258]  Like, that's the automatic thing you go to now.
[05:15:05.258 --> 05:15:08.040]  I mean, the script is now officially flipped.
[05:15:08.695 --> 05:15:17.140]  I mean, all it takes now is to tie a free-thinking, patriot-minded patsy on an event like Patriots Day to some CIA guy like
[05:15:20.325 --> 05:15:21.266]  I don't think so.
[05:15:39.760 --> 05:15:40.822]  Like the NRA.
[05:15:40.822 --> 05:15:42.484]  That's the text of the YouTube video.
[05:15:42.484 --> 05:15:50.333]  It's a 60 second like gun control video that Al Qaeda made conveniently before their last agenda.
[05:15:50.333 --> 05:15:54.018]  I mean, I just I see right through this, you know.
[05:15:54.018 --> 05:15:54.378]  All right.
[05:15:54.378 --> 05:15:55.319]  Thank you.
[05:15:55.319 --> 05:15:56.601]  We'll check that out.
[05:15:56.601 --> 05:15:58.984]  I will move on now to Dennis in Texas.
[05:16:01.428 --> 05:16:02.608]  Hi there.
[05:16:02.608 --> 05:16:03.269]  Can you hear me?
[05:16:03.269 --> 05:16:04.789]  Yes, go ahead.
[05:16:04.789 --> 05:16:06.710]  Okay, great.
[05:16:06.710 --> 05:16:09.151]  I've got a couple of things for you.
[05:16:09.151 --> 05:16:12.572]  I worked in the Middle East for almost 38 years.
[05:16:12.572 --> 05:16:16.014]  I've worked with the various agencies and
[05:16:17.934 --> 05:16:21.295]  Operating companies and operators.
[05:16:21.295 --> 05:16:27.656]  You're very correct about the uniform that these people were wearing.
[05:16:27.656 --> 05:16:35.797]  If you look, you'll probably find that they came from a company called 511, and the boots are Danner.
[05:16:35.797 --> 05:16:41.078]  The stuff, the tactical pants are 511s.
[05:16:41.078 --> 05:16:46.119]  It's a five-in-one jacket, and their caps, you're correct.
[05:16:47.705 --> 05:16:49.787]  As to the logo and everything.
[05:16:49.787 --> 05:16:56.411]  The Saudis don't operate with US Navy SEALs.
[05:16:56.411 --> 05:17:02.335]  They actually operate with the Special Boat Service, or SAS.
[05:17:02.335 --> 05:17:02.816]  SAS?
[05:17:02.816 --> 05:17:03.076]  SAS.
[05:17:03.076 --> 05:17:04.136]  Oh, SAS.
[05:17:04.136 --> 05:17:05.738]  The UK.
[05:17:05.738 --> 05:17:14.043]  And what I would suggest is that if we really want to get to the bottom of this,
[05:17:15.856 --> 05:17:38.485]  The people that are identified in the photos should be should be identified and brought forward and they should provide a critique for what happened during that operation and why it failed and what the intent of the operation was and they all work for us.
[05:17:38.485 --> 05:17:38.825]  Absolutely.
[05:17:38.825 --> 05:17:41.726]  There's no reason that they shouldn't be trotted out and
[05:17:44.071 --> 05:17:45.692]  Should provide a critique.
[05:17:45.692 --> 05:18:01.458]  And if the government, if the government is going to tell us that they need to take our liberties so that it can make us secure, then they need to give us an explanation as to why, when they have that many people and that concentrated in that area, they were so totally ineffective.
[05:18:01.458 --> 05:18:05.559]  Even when they apparently were looking and expecting something from all reports.
[05:18:05.559 --> 05:18:09.701]  Yeah, and I believe the agency that the guys allegedly worked for was called Kraft.
[05:18:10.521 --> 05:18:11.242]  Is that correct?
[05:18:11.242 --> 05:18:14.445]  Somebody had mentioned that.
[05:18:14.445 --> 05:18:24.975]  There's a lot of different companies, you know, but we're paying these people and they're kind of cowboys.
[05:18:24.975 --> 05:18:32.723]  In the Middle East, all the companies that were under DoD were brought under the UCMJ, but
[05:18:37.208 --> 05:18:47.755]  There was one company working for the State Department that wasn't brought under the UCMJ, and they're the people that became cowboys over there.
[05:18:47.755 --> 05:18:55.000]  They're the people that got killed in Fallujah, and they're the reason that Fallujah was destroyed.
[05:18:55.000 --> 05:18:56.802]  Basically, these people got scared.
[05:18:59.099 --> 05:19:00.361]  They thought they were surrounded.
[05:19:00.361 --> 05:19:02.724]  They just shot in all directions.
[05:19:02.724 --> 05:19:04.687]  The people became outraged.
[05:19:04.687 --> 05:19:06.630]  And they got hung from the bridge.
[05:19:06.630 --> 05:19:09.273]  And we, our military,
[05:19:10.871 --> 05:19:13.433]  Destroyed Fallujah for that reason.
[05:19:13.433 --> 05:19:14.034]  I watched it.
[05:19:31.770 --> 05:19:35.973]  They started filing in and now the guy's just standing at the door, so I guess we can take more calls.
[05:19:35.973 --> 05:19:37.093]  Sorry to the last caller.
[05:19:37.093 --> 05:19:40.675]  Still putting the finishing touches on that story, I guess, that they were going to break yesterday.
[05:19:40.675 --> 05:19:42.897]  Yeah, now people are slowly coming in.
[05:19:42.897 --> 05:19:44.577]  Saw three people walk through the door.
[05:19:44.577 --> 05:19:46.338]  Looks like some more are coming in.
[05:19:46.338 --> 05:19:47.939]  So we just want to be ready.
[05:19:47.939 --> 05:19:55.624]  And like the gentleman said, there were similarities to the group named Kraft with those alleged soldiers.
[05:19:55.624 --> 05:20:00.687]  We don't know that for sure that they were actually connected to the group, but there are some similarities in their appearance.
[05:20:01.850 --> 05:20:05.812]  Just to comment on what the last caller said.
[05:20:05.812 --> 05:20:09.153]  We're still waiting for some grand poobah to make their entrance.
[05:20:09.153 --> 05:20:15.115]  We've got a shot of the cameraman standing here at the entrance to the door waiting for someone to come in.
[05:20:15.115 --> 05:20:16.096]  No one is coming.
[05:20:16.096 --> 05:20:17.496]  Alright, so we'll go back to our call line.
[05:20:17.496 --> 05:20:22.418]  We'll go to Jim in New York.
[05:20:22.418 --> 05:20:24.659]  Hello, Jim.
[05:20:24.659 --> 05:20:25.179]  Well, never mind.
[05:20:25.179 --> 05:20:25.679]  We have Jim.
[05:20:25.679 --> 05:20:27.960]  Alright, well Jim, just stay right there.
[05:20:27.960 --> 05:20:28.581]  Jim, stay right there.
[05:20:28.581 --> 05:20:29.521]  Let's get audio, guys.
[05:20:34.144 --> 05:20:35.765]  We're waiting for him to say something.
[05:20:35.765 --> 05:20:39.367]  There we go.
[05:20:39.367 --> 05:20:40.287]  Good afternoon.
[05:20:40.287 --> 05:20:45.410]  My name is Richard Delaurier and I am the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston division.
[05:20:45.410 --> 05:20:54.536]  Since Monday's bombings, the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been working around the clock and are fully committed to investigating the matter, this matter, to bring those responsible to justice.
[05:20:55.456 --> 05:20:59.921]  Our collective law enforcement team has pursued thousands of leads and tips.
[05:20:59.921 --> 05:21:06.929]  As I said two days ago, we are working methodically and with a sense of urgency to identify those responsible for the bombings.
[05:21:06.929 --> 05:21:12.715]  Within the last day or so, through that careful process, we initially developed a single person of interest.
[05:21:13.596 --> 05:21:21.358]  Not knowing that the individual was acting alone or in concert with others, we obviously worked with extreme purpose to make that determination.
[05:21:21.358 --> 05:21:38.641]  The entire force of the federal government, the FBI in Boston, around the world, as well as our partners in the Boston Police, ATF, Massachusetts State Police, and more than 30 agencies of the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force have set about to ensure that all responsible for the bombings will be brought to justice.
[05:21:40.103 --> 05:21:47.658]  More importantly, it was done to ensure the future safety of the city of Boston, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the country.
[05:21:47.658 --> 05:21:51.045]  Indeed, through that process, the FBI developed a second suspect.
[05:21:53.171 --> 05:21:57.295]  Today we are enlisting the public's help to identify the two suspects.
[05:21:57.295 --> 05:22:04.301]  After a very detailed analysis of photo, video, and other evidence, we are releasing photos of these two suspects.
[05:22:04.301 --> 05:22:08.224]  They are identified as Suspect 1 and Suspect 2.
[05:22:08.224 --> 05:22:09.645]  They appear to be associated.
[05:22:10.746 --> 05:22:13.408]  Suspect 1 is wearing a dark hat.
[05:22:13.408 --> 05:22:16.110]  Suspect 2 is wearing a white hat.
[05:22:16.110 --> 05:22:24.657]  Suspect 2 set down a backpack at the site of the second explosion, just in front of the Forum Restaurant.
[05:22:24.657 --> 05:22:30.822]  We strongly encourage those who were at the Forum Restaurant, who have not contacted us yet, to do so.
[05:22:32.071 --> 05:22:42.353]  As you can see from one of the images, Suspects 1 and 2 appear to be walking together through the marathon crowd on Boylston Street in the direction of the finish line.
[05:22:42.353 --> 05:22:48.935]  That image was captured as they walked on Boylston in the vicinity of the intersection with Gloucester Street.
[05:22:48.935 --> 05:22:57.117]  As you can see, the quality of the photos is quite good, but we will continue to work on developing additional images to improve their identification value.
[05:22:58.860 --> 05:23:04.021]  Further, on FBI.gov, we have photos of the suspects.
[05:23:04.021 --> 05:23:09.503]  The photos and videos are posted for the public and media to use, review, and publicize.
[05:23:09.503 --> 05:23:17.025]  For clarity, these images should be the only ones, I emphasize the only ones, that the public should view to assist us.
[05:23:17.025 --> 05:23:26.348]  Other photos should not be deemed credible and they unnecessarily divert the public's attention in the wrong direction and create undue work for vital law enforcement resources.
[05:23:27.372 --> 05:23:33.616]  For more than 100 years, the FBI has relied upon the public to be its eyes and ears.
[05:23:33.616 --> 05:23:39.440]  With the media's help, in an instant, these images will be delivered directly into the hands of millions around the world.
[05:23:39.440 --> 05:23:43.963]  We know the public will play a critical role in identifying and locating these individuals.
[05:23:45.080 --> 05:23:52.542]  Somebody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbors, co-workers, or family members of the suspects.
[05:23:52.542 --> 05:24:01.204]  Though it may be difficult, the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us.
[05:24:01.204 --> 05:24:09.125]  No bit of information, no matter how small or seemingly inconsequential, is too small for us to see.
[05:24:09.125 --> 05:24:11.166]  Each piece moves us forward towards justice.
[05:24:12.188 --> 05:24:20.232]  It is extremely important to contact us with any information regarding the identities of Suspect 1, Suspect 2, and their location.
[05:24:20.232 --> 05:24:24.174]  We consider them to be armed and extremely dangerous.
[05:24:24.174 --> 05:24:26.315]  No one should approach them.
[05:24:26.315 --> 05:24:30.237]  No one should attempt to apprehend them except law enforcement.
[05:24:30.237 --> 05:24:32.579]  Let me reiterate that caution.
[05:24:32.579 --> 05:24:34.640]  Do not take any action on your own.
[05:24:36.249 --> 05:24:39.171]  If you see these men, contact law enforcement.
[05:24:39.171 --> 05:24:45.176]  If you know anything about the bombings or the men pictured here, please call the telephone listed on the photo arrays.
[05:24:45.176 --> 05:24:45.817]  That's 1-800-CALL-FBI.
[05:24:45.817 --> 05:24:46.217]  Again, that's 1-800-225-5324.
[05:24:46.217 --> 05:24:48.339]  All calls will be kept confidential.
[05:24:55.267 --> 05:24:59.349]  We have also established a website for tips that directly relates to the bombing.
[05:24:59.349 --> 05:25:06.732]  Please contact us at bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov.
[05:25:06.732 --> 05:25:12.755]  Again, that website is bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov.
[05:25:12.755 --> 05:25:15.176]  The photos can be viewed on our website, fbi.gov.
[05:25:17.588 --> 05:25:24.413]  It is important to emphasize the images from Monday are indelible and the horror of that day will remain with us forever.
[05:25:24.413 --> 05:25:31.878]  This further underscores our obligation to investigate this crime judiciously in order to bring those responsible to justice.
[05:25:31.878 --> 05:25:34.540]  The victims and the survivors deserve nothing more.
[05:25:36.001 --> 05:25:37.442]  Nothing less, excuse me.
[05:25:37.442 --> 05:25:46.766]  As to Monday's victims, the FBI is committed to ensuring that victims receive the rights they are entitled to and the assistance they need to cope with the crime.
[05:25:46.766 --> 05:25:54.169]  Treating victims with respect and providing them with assistance, benefits, and help and assistance will better our cases.
[05:25:55.069 --> 05:26:02.194]  Our resources include an office of victim assistance at FBI headquarters and victim specialists nationwide.
[05:26:02.194 --> 05:26:12.382]  These highly trained professionals can assist victims and coordinate with other agencies to provide victims with the support, information, and resources necessary to effectively meet their needs.
[05:26:12.382 --> 05:26:17.686]  Our victim specialist team continues to work around the clock to bring assistance to the victims of this heinous act.
[05:26:19.969 --> 05:26:24.355]  Identifying and locating those responsible is now our highest priority.
[05:26:24.355 --> 05:26:30.043]  No other details of the investigation will be released at this time because this is our focus now.
[05:26:30.043 --> 05:26:33.528]  It continues to be an ongoing, active investigation.
[05:26:34.403 --> 05:26:44.426]  Review these photographs and contact us at 1-800-CALL-FBI or www.bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov immediately.
[05:26:44.426 --> 05:26:45.866]  Thank you very much.
[05:26:45.866 --> 05:26:46.226]  Karen?
[05:26:46.226 --> 05:26:51.527]  Rick, I was wondering if, should there be arrests, what potential charges do you have?
[05:26:54.586 --> 05:26:56.668]  I wouldn't want to comment on that, Karen, right now.
[05:26:56.668 --> 05:26:57.609]  I would allow U.S.
[05:26:57.609 --> 05:26:59.210]  Attorney Ortiz to comment on that aspect.
[05:27:16.690 --> 05:27:22.334]  The only one who has observed planting what we believe to be the device is suspect number two with a white cap.
[05:27:22.334 --> 05:27:24.475]  What time did they put those devices down?
[05:27:24.475 --> 05:27:26.736]  I don't have the precise time in front of me.
[05:27:26.736 --> 05:27:28.698]  It was shortly before the bomb blast went off.
[05:27:28.698 --> 05:27:30.179]  Within minutes.
[05:27:35.733 --> 05:27:41.917]  At this time, these are the people of interest to the FBI.
[05:27:41.917 --> 05:27:48.181]  Do you have any information on what they did after the explosions?
[05:27:48.181 --> 05:27:50.302]  Any indication they were around watching?
[05:27:50.302 --> 05:27:52.084]  Do you have any videos of them walking away?
[05:27:53.702 --> 05:28:00.091]  Suspect number two, with the white cap on, proceeded west on Boylston Street.
[05:28:00.091 --> 05:28:01.132]  And that's all we know right now.
[05:28:08.642 --> 05:28:15.644]  I'm just wondering what it does to your investigation when things like this get out and these guys are wrong.
[05:28:15.644 --> 05:28:24.787]  I think I addressed that, thank you, and I think I addressed that question in my statement by saying the only officials you should be officially relied upon in this investigation are those you see before you today.
[05:28:33.368 --> 05:28:34.909]  I do stand by that statement right now.
[05:28:34.909 --> 05:28:41.414]  There's no additional imminent danger that we are aware of right now.
[05:28:41.414 --> 05:28:43.475]  They're ending the conference now.
[05:28:43.475 --> 05:28:45.737]  Dan Badani got a question in.
[05:28:45.737 --> 05:28:48.959]  Again, the photos are available at FBI.gov.
[05:28:48.959 --> 05:28:52.422]  We'll have more information when we have something to release publicly.
[05:28:52.422 --> 05:28:54.103]  We'll be back, but we'll let you know.
[05:28:54.103 --> 05:28:57.185]  Check our website, FBI.gov.
[05:28:57.185 --> 05:28:58.386]  Sounds like Dan in the background.
[05:29:01.047 --> 05:29:28.120]  So you heard the FBI agent say these are the only images that you need to focus on these two guys out of everybody in the crowd and don't get me wrong I'm sure the FBI is competent and you know definitely looking into the situation but as Dan pointed out we have other images on InfoWars.com there are images on other sites that may not be on InfoWars.com of other people that may be
[05:29:29.560 --> 05:29:32.022]  Included in the in the in the bombing.
[05:29:32.022 --> 05:29:48.092]  I'm not as confident as you are in their competence Because quite frankly, you know, he said to go to FBI gov I went there with my iPad and Safari can't open because the server has stopped responding So they they put all this on a web page where they couldn't handle the traffic.
[05:29:48.092 --> 05:29:50.154]  Did they not anticipate that?
[05:29:50.154 --> 05:29:51.275]  I'm sure they did.
[05:29:51.275 --> 05:29:59.160]  I mean, I'm sure the I'm sure the writers or you know Whoever will put the the suspects on with our our pictures that we have on Infowars.com
[05:29:59.560 --> 05:30:03.524]  But we didn't see any pictures of, you know, the stuff that's been floating around.
[05:30:03.524 --> 05:30:06.187]  No, they didn't address that at all.
[05:30:06.187 --> 05:30:13.796]  And, you know, it's worth noting here that Peter King was saying, you know, we need to have more cameras, we need to have more cameras.
[05:30:13.796 --> 05:30:17.039]  What he means by that is they need to have more government cameras, he thinks.
[05:30:17.039 --> 05:30:17.320]  Exactly.
[05:30:18.561 --> 05:30:19.582]  We're good to go.
[05:30:39.221 --> 05:30:42.203]  And I definitely can't wait to see that video when he sees Dan.
[05:30:42.203 --> 05:30:43.584]  He's like, oh man, it's him again!
[05:30:43.584 --> 05:30:44.325]  Again!
[05:30:44.325 --> 05:30:46.346]  Like, who let that guy in here?
[05:30:46.346 --> 05:30:47.127]  Next question.
[05:30:47.127 --> 05:30:48.307]  Yeah, next question.
[05:30:48.307 --> 05:30:54.111]  Okay, so I guess, guys, we will roll just to 5 o'clock just to make it good and even and take some calls on this.
[05:30:54.111 --> 05:30:55.132]  The number to call in is 877-789-ALEX.
[05:30:55.132 --> 05:30:55.612]  That is 877-789-2539.
[05:30:55.612 --> 05:30:58.935]  Jim, in New York, did you have a chance to see the press conference?
[05:31:08.342 --> 05:31:09.202]  Hello, Jim in New York.
[05:31:09.202 --> 05:31:09.843]  Are you there?
[05:31:09.843 --> 05:31:12.124]  I'm serving the Boston bombings, okay?
[05:31:12.124 --> 05:31:15.006]  I'm sorry, I think we missed the... Yes, yeah, go ahead.
[05:31:15.006 --> 05:31:16.527]  Start from the beginning.
[05:31:16.527 --> 05:31:21.729]  Yeah, something very strange happened to me, considering the Boston bombings, alright?
[05:31:21.729 --> 05:31:31.095]  I took advantage of the Paul Revere contest, and I did a video, and I shipped out two squatty-potties to Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bloomberg.
[05:31:31.095 --> 05:31:31.975]  This was Sunday.
[05:31:31.975 --> 05:31:32.896]  Okay.
[05:31:32.896 --> 05:31:37.038]  Come Tuesday, when the Boxing Board received my video on YouTube,
[05:31:37.816 --> 05:31:42.838]  It's related and associated to everything that happened in Boston.
[05:31:42.838 --> 05:31:43.838]  Can you say that again?
[05:31:43.838 --> 05:31:48.219]  You sent out two squatty potties and then what happened after that?
[05:31:48.219 --> 05:31:56.482]  I sent out two squatty potties Sunday morning at about 5 in the morning from Rochester, New York out in Henrietta to Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo.
[05:31:56.482 --> 05:31:59.143]  And they decorated the outside of the box, so it was comical in nature.
[05:32:01.309 --> 05:32:15.113]  So, Tuesday, I looked at my YouTube channel, where it said related videos to, you know, the Paul Revere contest, the Sploddy Potty winner contest, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bloomberg.
[05:32:15.113 --> 05:32:22.054]  When I clicked on related videos, all the videos that were uploaded for the Boston bombing was related to me.
[05:32:22.054 --> 05:32:23.815]  Now, the thing is this.
[05:32:24.800 --> 05:32:26.022]  I'm a guy that wears a mask.
[05:32:26.022 --> 05:32:27.083]  I'm in a kilt.
[05:32:27.083 --> 05:32:30.046]  I asked him to do a billionaire thing.
[05:32:30.046 --> 05:32:31.868]  I tried some comedy, satire, and humor.
[05:32:31.868 --> 05:32:33.309]  Squatty Potty Contest Winner.
[05:32:33.309 --> 05:32:34.130]  New York City Twin Sphincters.
[05:32:48.508 --> 05:32:50.270]  And do you want the channel name?
[05:32:50.270 --> 05:32:52.872]  Because it's the feature video and I'm not doing this for this.
[05:32:52.872 --> 05:33:03.042]  I can actually email you the pictures and a brief video or I'll try to upload a video tonight from my phone that I actually have the videos that were associated with me.
[05:33:03.042 --> 05:33:08.127]  So number one, nothing in the title is associated with what happened Monday.
[05:33:08.127 --> 05:33:09.888]  My video was uploaded Sunday.
[05:33:09.888 --> 05:33:12.391]  I'm a guy that
[05:33:13.897 --> 05:33:15.018]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[05:33:15.018 --> 05:33:16.099]  Let me ask...
[05:33:44.495 --> 05:33:52.757]  That's interesting.
[05:33:52.757 --> 05:33:58.898]  Now, as part of the contest, typically it's a requirement that you put InfoWars.com in the description.
[05:33:58.898 --> 05:33:59.618]  Was that also there?
[05:33:59.618 --> 05:34:01.238]  You had a meta tag of Alex Jones.
[05:34:01.238 --> 05:34:03.499]  Did you have InfoWars.com in the description?
[05:34:03.499 --> 05:34:04.599]  Yes, I did.
[05:34:04.599 --> 05:34:06.379]  I most definitely did that.
[05:34:06.379 --> 05:34:11.300]  It's, you know, the squatty potty, you know, contest winners and the rest of the name.
[05:34:12.060 --> 05:34:14.562]  What is this?
[05:34:14.562 --> 05:34:17.505]  Am I being set up as a potential future Patsy?
[05:34:17.505 --> 05:34:22.208]  If you check out the video, I'm a guy who's animated with a mask and a kilt.
[05:34:22.208 --> 05:34:25.731]  You know what I'm saying?
[05:34:25.731 --> 05:34:31.035]  I'm trying to deliver the message in a different way than the typical New World Order,
[05:34:33.437 --> 05:34:35.177]  I'm trying to get some levity to it.
[05:34:35.177 --> 05:34:35.798]  Right, right.
[05:34:35.798 --> 05:34:37.598]  Yeah, comedy can be very effective.
[05:34:37.598 --> 05:34:47.420]  It'll be interesting to see if any others that are tagged with InfoWars or Alex Jones, if that was the thing that was doing it or exactly what tagged it over there.
[05:34:47.420 --> 05:34:49.780]  Yeah, we'd have to see if any other videos.
[05:34:49.780 --> 05:34:50.560]  Thanks for pointing that out.
[05:34:50.560 --> 05:34:51.200]  We'll take a look at that.
[05:34:51.200 --> 05:34:58.362]  Yeah, we'll definitely take a look at that because we'd have to look at more entries and it may not just have been yours if that was indeed the case, but we'll look into that.
[05:34:58.362 --> 05:34:58.822]  Thank you for your
[05:34:59.722 --> 05:35:07.768]  It might have been something as innocent as that and the fact that so many of the videos that Alex has done about this bombing have gone viral.
[05:35:07.768 --> 05:35:08.628]  Oh yeah, recently.
[05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:14.632]  And so they look at a viral video and topics on it and then they, you know, find that relationship there.
[05:35:14.632 --> 05:35:15.773]  So that might have been the common thread.
[05:35:15.773 --> 05:35:16.833]  We'll have to take a look at that.
[05:35:16.833 --> 05:35:17.534]  Alright, thank you for your call.
[05:35:17.534 --> 05:35:20.356]  We'll move on to Dennis in London.
[05:35:20.356 --> 05:35:22.017]  Hi.
[05:35:22.017 --> 05:35:22.517]  Hi, go ahead.
[05:35:23.556 --> 05:35:29.680]  Yeah, um, I just wanted to say, in the last few days, there's been a lot of black helicopters in the skies above London.
[05:35:29.680 --> 05:35:31.421]  Hmm.
[05:35:31.421 --> 05:35:33.263]  And, um... Anywhere in particular?
[05:35:33.263 --> 05:35:33.643]  Any locations?
[05:35:33.643 --> 05:35:35.324]  The Watson-Thatcher funeral.
[05:35:35.324 --> 05:35:36.765]  Oh yeah, that is correct.
[05:35:36.765 --> 05:35:42.068]  Yeah, there's been that as well, but I mean, we've been seeing them for a long time now.
[05:35:42.068 --> 05:35:46.351]  Not just in the last few days, it's quite a common thing.
[05:35:46.351 --> 05:35:50.834]  And people don't really talk about it, but it's happening a lot.
[05:35:50.834 --> 05:35:52.836]  And, um, there's one thing I want to say.
[05:35:53.689 --> 05:36:03.292]  I don't know if you're aware of it, but on the White House website, I believe it is, Obama put his birth certificate up there.
[05:36:03.292 --> 05:36:04.853]  Are you serious?
[05:36:04.853 --> 05:36:05.293]  Yeah.
[05:36:05.293 --> 05:36:06.933]  Can we pull that up right now?
[05:36:06.933 --> 05:36:10.334]  Is that something new, or is that the old photoshopped thing?
[05:36:10.334 --> 05:36:12.095]  Yeah, the photoshopped thing.
[05:36:12.095 --> 05:36:16.236]  If you open it up in Adobe Illustrator, you can see that it's made up of different layers.
[05:36:16.236 --> 05:36:17.136]  Right, right, yeah.
[05:36:17.136 --> 05:36:18.177]  Oh, so it's nothing recent.
[05:36:18.177 --> 05:36:19.317]  It's nothing recent is what you're saying.
[05:36:19.317 --> 05:36:21.738]  Well, I only found it out last week, but the thing is...
[05:36:23.058 --> 05:36:27.100]  I went on that website and then within an hour I had police knocking on my door.
[05:36:27.100 --> 05:36:28.060]  Really?
[05:36:28.060 --> 05:36:30.121]  Were they questioning you about that specifically?
[05:36:30.121 --> 05:36:31.022]  No, they didn't.
[05:36:31.022 --> 05:36:34.583]  They were asking me about other stuff in the area but it was really dodgy.
[05:36:34.583 --> 05:36:38.065]  It was one police officer by himself.
[05:36:38.065 --> 05:36:46.669]  He just kept staring really into my eyes and then he said he was going to knock on other doors in the building but when I looked out my window he had left.
[05:36:48.937 --> 05:36:57.580]  Well, I tell you, you know, we've had, you're talking about this in England, we had someone calling yesterday talking about changes that he's seeing in Canada.
[05:36:57.580 --> 05:37:08.963]  As I was driving last night, I heard picked up here on the local radio station is a program from a guy that's out of Australia and he was basically talking, they have something similar to the Utah Data Center.
[05:37:09.803 --> 05:37:30.385]  And he was talking about how they were keeping track and spying on citizens in Australia and how many times they had set up patsies and done exactly the same sort of thing that we see done here by the FBI in the United States where they would go out and get a patsy and you would find that all these guys around him that were organizing this failed attempt
[05:37:31.325 --> 05:37:32.767]  We're all government agents.
[05:37:32.767 --> 05:37:43.315]  And they were planning it, they were funding it, they were training it, and they were putting the whole thing out and at the last minute they pull it in and make a big press event out of it and arrest the patsy.
[05:37:43.315 --> 05:37:45.376]  And he was saying that they're doing the same thing there.
[05:37:45.376 --> 05:37:46.838]  You know, it's a global pattern.
[05:37:47.458 --> 05:37:55.988]  And that's what we're talking about, and that's why we talk about things like the New World Order, and we see things that are being done like the UN Arms Trade Treaty.
[05:37:55.988 --> 05:37:58.171]  I mean, it is an Agenda 21.
[05:37:58.171 --> 05:38:00.774]  These are things that are not just unique to the United States.
[05:38:00.774 --> 05:38:07.202]  They may be driven primarily by a lot of power brokers that are located primarily in the United States, but these are global issues.
[05:38:07.765 --> 05:38:09.366]  All right, thank you for your call, Dennis.
[05:38:09.366 --> 05:38:13.027]  Now, we're trying to talk specifically about the recent press conference.
[05:38:13.027 --> 05:38:18.250]  If you have another topic, that's fine, but try to keep your comment brief, because we want to talk about the recent press conference.
[05:38:18.250 --> 05:38:21.992]  We'll move on to Brandon in Texas.
[05:38:21.992 --> 05:38:23.272]  Hey, Jakari, can you hear me?
[05:38:23.272 --> 05:38:24.633]  Yes, I can.
[05:38:24.633 --> 05:38:29.835]  Okay, yeah, sorry, this is not about the press conference, but it is about what you guys are talking about.
[05:38:29.835 --> 05:38:30.816]  I met you in Katy.
[05:38:30.816 --> 05:38:35.798]  Y'all came down here to protest Pierce Morgan, and I want to give you some information that
[05:38:36.727 --> 05:38:37.668]  You didn't really talk about.
[05:38:37.668 --> 05:38:39.109]  Okay.
[05:38:39.109 --> 05:38:42.932]  Which was the Batman map about Sandy Hook.
[05:38:42.932 --> 05:38:43.513]  Okay, go ahead.
[05:38:43.513 --> 05:38:48.537]  Okay, now if you look at the whole thing, have your listeners take a look at the map.
[05:38:48.537 --> 05:38:54.182]  No, no, sir, before you get into that, have you seen our article on Infowars.com about the Batman maps?
[05:38:54.182 --> 05:39:02.089]  Well, you guys talk about the Sandy Hook, which is fine, which is strike point one, which it shows, but all the symbolism on Gotham,
[05:39:02.828 --> 05:39:11.170]  We're on strike point four, which is the Patriot symbolism, the object, the 13 objects in a circle, just like the George Washington flag you cross with the Delaware.
[05:39:11.170 --> 05:39:12.971]  Right.
[05:39:12.971 --> 05:39:14.671]  Now that's strike point four.
[05:39:14.671 --> 05:39:22.233]  Strike point two is the far right of the pyramid, which was Alex, you know, going with Pierce Morgan.
[05:39:22.233 --> 05:39:24.673]  They're going after the far right.
[05:39:24.673 --> 05:39:26.874]  Strike point three was the head of the snake.
[05:39:26.874 --> 05:39:30.835]  You had the FPS Russia guy and other people getting whacked mysteriously.
[05:39:31.562 --> 05:39:33.925]  Now we're on strike point four, which is the Patriots.
[05:39:33.925 --> 05:39:43.999]  Now we have strike point five, which is the last one, which is the capstone of the pyramid, which could be the elite can orchestrate attack on themselves to victimize themselves.
[05:39:43.999 --> 05:39:48.204]  It's kind of hard to follow when we don't have a visual on it, but you know what the best thing that you can do?
[05:39:48.865 --> 05:39:49.846]  All right, thank you for your call, Brandon.
[05:39:49.846 --> 05:39:52.369]  We'll move on now to Derek in Wisconsin.
[05:39:52.369 --> 05:39:53.210]  Hi, how are you guys doing?
[05:39:53.210 --> 05:39:53.771]  Very well.
[05:40:10.994 --> 05:40:13.797]  I just want to thank you guys for what you're all doing.
[05:40:13.797 --> 05:40:18.161]  Did you guys finish watching the CNN broadcast with Dan there?
[05:40:18.161 --> 05:40:19.182]  Yes, yes.
[05:40:19.182 --> 05:40:20.063]  You noticed him as well.
[05:40:22.938 --> 05:40:34.591]  You know that's what I wanted to see because we were watching it on CNN and I was wondering if maybe there was another news network that had an angle because I could see somebody when the FBI guy was up somebody walking behind him looked like he was walking real fast.
[05:40:34.591 --> 05:40:42.820]  I finished watching it before they cut it out and by the end of the feed Dan had like a group of reporters and cameras around him.
[05:40:43.460 --> 05:40:47.001]  He's all yelling about that.
[05:40:47.001 --> 05:40:51.302]  I'm sure we have that recorded on various channels and we can set it up.
[05:40:51.302 --> 05:40:55.984]  We may not have it tonight for the nightly news but I'm sure by sometime tomorrow we can get those clips together.
[05:40:55.984 --> 05:40:58.204]  Real quick question if I could.
[05:40:58.204 --> 05:40:59.325]  Sure.
[05:40:59.325 --> 05:41:05.986]  For an average person, I wanted to start out as far as doing what you guys are doing.
[05:41:05.986 --> 05:41:08.387]  It just seems like blogging and website isn't enough.
[05:41:08.387 --> 05:41:10.828]  What do you guys suggest for an average person to do?
[05:41:13.339 --> 05:41:29.826]  I'll tell you how I got turned on to this information was watching documentaries not necessarily Alex's documentaries but documentaries especially some of his older stuff because you talk about Alex Jones and they want to talk about you know the stuff he's talking about today well the FBI says it's these two guys and Alex Jones saying hey look at these guys
[05:41:30.186 --> 05:41:49.842]  Go back find some old school Alex Jones footage like there's a clip of Alex Jones I can't remember what movie it's in but he's telling people back in the 90s that they're gonna start putting microphones and cameras on streetlights and people like oh you're crazy Alex Jones and now that stuff's admitted so I would go watch that old stuff so you can see how the things he actually talks about back in the day have actually come true.
[05:41:49.842 --> 05:41:55.346]  But Carl are you asking how you could get involved in helping inform people is that what you're asking?
[05:41:56.141 --> 05:42:02.166]  Well, yeah, because it seems a little like, like you said, you can build a blog, a website, but it's just, you know, it doesn't seem like enough.
[05:42:02.166 --> 05:42:04.808]  I mean, anybody can redistribute information.
[05:42:04.808 --> 05:42:12.294]  Well, that's true, but I would take a look at some of the really gutsy stuff that Luke Rudowsky's doing, that sort of thing.
[05:42:12.294 --> 05:42:16.938]  I mean, you know, you're going to have to do something like that and get out there.
[05:42:16.938 --> 05:42:22.342]  But, you know, if you put yourself out there, yeah, if you sit in your basement and you write blogs and stuff, that's really not going to do it.
[05:42:22.802 --> 05:42:24.603]  Well, if you get out there and get a job.
[05:42:38.672 --> 05:42:39.272]  Yes, I'm in Montreal, Canada.
[05:42:39.272 --> 05:42:40.433]  Thank you for taking my call, gentlemen.
[05:42:40.433 --> 05:42:41.034]  How are you guys?
[05:43:08.194 --> 05:43:08.655]  Good.
[05:43:08.655 --> 05:43:11.919]  It's so nice to meet you, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Knight, finally.
[05:43:11.919 --> 05:43:15.624]  I just wanted to make some remarks about the press conference, if I could?
[05:43:15.624 --> 05:43:17.507]  Sure, go ahead.
[05:43:17.507 --> 05:43:25.157]  Did you notice the, or some observations, did you notice the first gentleman, the first suspect is wearing a ball cap with a logo on it?
[05:43:25.751 --> 05:43:32.953]  Yes, he didn't look like, just the way he was dressed, he didn't look like the other guys we've been talking about, but I did notice some similarities in that, but go ahead.
[05:43:32.953 --> 05:43:34.934]  Ten pants, but not ten shoes.
[05:43:34.934 --> 05:43:35.654]  Exactly.
[05:43:35.654 --> 05:43:40.095]  So, you know, there's just that enough that they throw in there to throw you off.
[05:43:40.095 --> 05:43:42.716]  Conveniently, they all wear ball caps, so that's good.
[05:43:42.716 --> 05:43:44.996]  I'm glad they got that together.
[05:43:44.996 --> 05:43:49.138]  But these have to be the quickest press conferences ever.
[05:43:49.138 --> 05:43:51.378]  Yes, yes.
[05:43:51.378 --> 05:43:53.059]  Dan keeps shutting these guys down.
[05:43:53.059 --> 05:43:53.559]  I love it.
[05:43:55.138 --> 05:43:57.180]  You know, he hasn't called us yet.
[05:43:57.180 --> 05:43:58.161]  He hasn't called us yet.
[05:43:58.161 --> 05:44:02.166]  We're kind of expecting a call from him and I think he's probably holding his own press conference.
[05:44:02.166 --> 05:44:06.811]  It's probably going to last longer than the one the FBI... Yeah, you guys definitely let us know.
[05:44:06.811 --> 05:44:10.135]  If we can't get him on, we'll try to get him on maybe the nightly news.
[05:44:10.135 --> 05:44:12.778]  Okay, yeah, but did you have any other comments on that, Jeff?
[05:44:13.941 --> 05:44:22.003]  Well, I just think that it was incredibly obvious that the FBI special agent was extremely nervous.
[05:44:22.003 --> 05:44:24.444]  You could tell by his voice.
[05:44:24.444 --> 05:44:26.425]  I would like to ask you a couple of questions.
[05:44:26.425 --> 05:44:28.865]  Why did they wait until 5 p.m.
[05:44:28.865 --> 05:44:34.767]  to show the American public and the world that they have suspects, these two suspects?
[05:44:34.767 --> 05:44:40.749]  You would think that they would just release that right away, I mean, get this out, be on the lookout kind of stuff.
[05:44:40.749 --> 05:44:41.809]  And my second question is,
[05:44:42.929 --> 05:44:51.575]  For you guys to answer, perhaps, is why is Israel sending in experts to help the Boston Police Department or the FBI?
[05:44:51.575 --> 05:44:53.276]  I was not aware of that.
[05:44:53.276 --> 05:44:56.278]  Did they announce that, or was that something you saw somewhere else?
[05:44:56.278 --> 05:44:57.679]  I didn't catch that in the press conference.
[05:44:57.679 --> 05:44:58.440]  I'm not aware of that.
[05:44:58.440 --> 05:45:00.921]  Mr. Jackson, I read that on the internet today.
[05:45:00.921 --> 05:45:03.103]  I believe it was... Do you know a site?
[05:45:03.103 --> 05:45:04.764]  You can look for yourselves.
[05:45:04.764 --> 05:45:09.147]  Google Israel sending in experts to help the FBI.
[05:45:10.240 --> 05:45:12.161]  Just bizarre stuff.
[05:45:12.161 --> 05:45:14.222]  I was wondering if you guys could check that out.
[05:45:14.222 --> 05:45:18.643]  Do you have any source, CBS, ABC, anything?
[05:45:18.643 --> 05:45:20.864]  Let me just take a look here.
[05:45:20.864 --> 05:45:23.685]  I've been posting this stuff on Facebook all day, but let me take a look here.
[05:45:23.685 --> 05:45:29.747]  I can imagine they would justify that by saying that there's been so many civilian bombings in Israel that these people have had some experience on it.
[05:45:29.747 --> 05:45:32.068]  But, you know, who knows about that?
[05:45:32.068 --> 05:45:36.810]  But in terms of why they would wait until this point to put out that little information,
[05:45:37.691 --> 05:45:43.596]  I think it really goes back to the fact that, you know, they were originally scheduled to do this 24 hours ago.
[05:45:43.596 --> 05:45:50.602]  And it was after we picked up those pictures that they changed the schedule, after we started talking about those different pictures.
[05:45:50.602 --> 05:45:57.628]  And to me, it was, all he said in the press conference was, we've got two pictures of individuals.
[05:45:57.628 --> 05:45:58.909]  Ignore everything else you've heard.
[05:45:59.249 --> 05:46:05.773]  Yeah, that's pretty much what... And when Dan tried to ask him follow-up questions on that, he shut Dan down and... And shut the conference down.
[05:46:05.773 --> 05:46:07.794]  Shut the conference down, because you can't shut Dan down.
[05:46:07.794 --> 05:46:09.054]  Yeah, you can't shut Dan down.
[05:46:09.054 --> 05:46:10.995]  Well, we'll definitely look into that, Jeff.
[05:46:10.995 --> 05:46:12.296]  Thank you for your call.
[05:46:12.296 --> 05:46:15.938]  Alright, now, once again... Hey guys, I just gotta say, I'm gonna cover this on the Nightly News.
[05:46:15.938 --> 05:46:17.339]  This is a desperate cover-up.
[05:46:17.699 --> 05:46:17.819]  Yeah.
[05:46:38.755 --> 05:46:41.617]  Please don't look at any other photos that are out there, i.e.
[05:46:41.617 --> 05:46:43.059]  Infowars.com.
[05:46:43.059 --> 05:46:44.520]  Janet Napolitano is in Congress.
[05:46:44.520 --> 05:46:47.562]  Do not look at Drudge, who's carrying our stuff.
[05:46:47.562 --> 05:46:50.545]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range right now.
[05:46:50.545 --> 05:46:50.905]  Yep.
[05:46:50.905 --> 05:46:51.906]  Thank you, Alex.
[05:46:51.906 --> 05:46:55.229]  Alright, so Alex, you're doing the show tonight, correct?
[05:46:55.229 --> 05:46:56.530]  Uh, yeah, yeah.
[05:46:56.530 --> 05:46:57.250]  Okay.
[05:46:57.250 --> 05:46:58.011]  Alright, there you go.
[05:46:58.011 --> 05:46:59.012]  Alex Jones, 7 p.m.
[05:46:59.012 --> 05:47:00.713]  Central, Infowars, Nightly News.
[05:47:00.713 --> 05:47:04.957]  Alright, we'll move on now to Adam in Florida.
[05:47:04.957 --> 05:47:05.797]  Hey, good afternoon, guys.
[05:47:05.797 --> 05:47:07.239]  Thank you for taking my call.
[05:47:07.239 --> 05:47:07.479]  Thank you.
[05:47:08.744 --> 05:47:10.726]  A couple comments I wanted to bring up.
[05:47:10.726 --> 05:47:13.549]  First of all, I really appreciate what you guys are doing.
[05:47:13.549 --> 05:47:24.600]  I mean, I know from personal experience, just my group of people that I communicate with, I've turned on so many people to you guys and they thank me, you know, and I'm like, no, thank these guys.
[05:47:24.600 --> 05:47:29.485]  These guys are on the streets, you know, they're putting in the hours and again, I can't thank you enough for what you do.
[05:47:29.485 --> 05:47:30.065]  No, thank you.
[05:47:31.198 --> 05:47:36.003]  Just watch the Senator questioning Napolitano.
[05:47:36.003 --> 05:47:38.005]  Hey guys, keep going.
[05:47:38.005 --> 05:47:39.467]  Get Badandi on his corner.
[05:47:39.467 --> 05:47:40.208]  Badandi!
[05:47:40.208 --> 05:47:41.389]  Okay, alright.
[05:47:41.389 --> 05:47:42.190]  Guys in front of him.
[05:47:42.190 --> 05:47:42.810]  Guys on him.
[05:47:42.810 --> 05:47:44.672]  Okay, Adam, just hang on.
[05:47:44.672 --> 05:47:45.934]  We gotta get Dan Badandi.
[05:47:45.934 --> 05:47:46.835]  Stay right there, Adam.
[05:47:46.835 --> 05:47:48.897]  Tell us when you have Dan on the line.
[05:47:48.897 --> 05:47:50.098]  So we have Dan Badandi.
[05:47:50.098 --> 05:47:51.339]  He was at the press conference.
[05:47:51.339 --> 05:47:52.841]  If you didn't see him, you definitely heard him.
[05:47:53.001 --> 05:47:53.081]  Yep.
[05:48:09.833 --> 05:48:10.914]  All right, there's Dan Vidotti.
[05:48:10.914 --> 05:48:11.994]  All right, Dan, Dan, Dan.
[05:48:11.994 --> 05:48:13.595]  All right, start at the beginning.
[05:48:13.595 --> 05:48:16.417]  So you're sitting there, and the press conference starts, and what happens?
[05:48:16.417 --> 05:48:17.818]  I'm sitting in the press conference.
[05:48:17.818 --> 05:48:22.741]  I'm holding the photos, and I heard one of the FBI agents go over into the holding cage and got photos.
[05:48:22.741 --> 05:48:27.043]  Then they come back right away, and they're saying, explaining.
[05:48:27.043 --> 05:48:29.225]  Dan, I know you're excited, but don't talk so loud.
[05:48:29.225 --> 05:48:29.985]  It's overdriving.
[05:48:29.985 --> 05:48:31.546]  Just relax and talk slowly.
[05:48:31.546 --> 05:48:34.368]  All right, I'm a little excited here.
[05:48:38.941 --> 05:48:41.483]  Okay, Dan, so you start asking your questions.
[05:48:41.483 --> 05:48:43.224]  Now, were you surrounded?
[05:48:43.224 --> 05:48:45.105]  Were you mobbed by the FBI guys?
[05:49:09.170 --> 05:49:12.012]  Oh yeah, they come right up to me like a bunch of Gestapo guys.
[05:49:12.012 --> 05:49:13.432]  I'm not afraid of criminals.
[05:49:13.432 --> 05:49:17.534]  So about how many... They think they can use a skill tactic against us.
[05:49:17.534 --> 05:49:21.336]  Yeah, Dan, about how many people do you think there were that surrounded you?
[05:49:21.336 --> 05:49:22.897]  Um, like you said, everybody up in the front.
[05:49:22.897 --> 05:49:24.978]  I mean, you should be able to see it on the news.
[05:49:24.978 --> 05:49:26.959]  I was just too excited at the time.
[05:49:26.959 --> 05:49:29.040]  It's crazy over here.
[05:49:29.040 --> 05:49:31.962]  I mean, we've got cops spilling out over here.
[05:49:31.962 --> 05:49:35.224]  I've got two guys that are running video cameras out the whole time.
[05:49:35.224 --> 05:49:37.665]  Hopefully we can make it safely out of Boston.
[05:49:39.195 --> 05:49:47.299]  Dan, we had some reports that after the FBI spokesperson left, that there were press gathered around you and interviewing you.
[05:49:47.299 --> 05:49:49.080]  Did you have some comments to give other people?
[05:49:49.080 --> 05:49:50.621]  Oh, absolutely!
[05:49:50.621 --> 05:49:52.402]  I showed them the photographs and they noticed, right?
[05:49:52.402 --> 05:49:59.046]  When I presented the photographs, they noticed how the corn on the back of me put up this clipboard to block my photographs from the cameras.
[05:49:59.651 --> 05:50:00.231]  Really?
[05:50:00.231 --> 05:50:07.395]  And they didn't want these photos to be shown, they shut the entire press conference down because I revealed, I exposed the truth of what's going on.
[05:50:07.395 --> 05:50:11.897]  Okay, Dan, can you think of anybody in particular, did you notice any particular affiliate or anybody to talk to?
[05:50:11.897 --> 05:50:13.157]  Devastating victory!
[05:50:13.157 --> 05:50:13.958]  Devastating!
[05:50:13.958 --> 05:50:16.199]  Everybody should join him at the next press conference!
[05:50:16.199 --> 05:50:18.660]  All real media converge on Boston!
[05:50:18.660 --> 05:50:20.461]  Defeat the terrorist!
[05:50:20.461 --> 05:50:28.105]  Alright, Alex, so Dan, did you notice anybody in particular that you gave an interview to, any affiliate, any local person?
[05:50:30.357 --> 05:50:31.638]  I'm sorry, repeat that question.
[05:50:31.638 --> 05:50:34.020]  Did you find any, can you think of anybody in particular?
[05:50:34.020 --> 05:50:34.881]  Did you talk to CNN?
[05:50:34.881 --> 05:50:35.701]  Did you talk to Fox?
[05:50:35.701 --> 05:50:37.603]  Was there anybody in particular you talked to?
[05:50:37.603 --> 05:50:38.483]  I talked to everybody.
[05:50:38.483 --> 05:50:41.886]  I mean, I just don't respond to cameras and reporters, though.
[05:50:41.886 --> 05:50:45.028]  I mean, it's like the whole world just, uh, they're waiting for me all the time.
[05:50:45.862 --> 05:50:51.126]  Okay, so if you're out there and you're an InfoWarrior, especially if you're in the city of Boston, watch your local news.
[05:50:51.126 --> 05:50:56.130]  See if you can find those Dan Bodondi clips and send them to us at showtips at InfoWars.
[05:50:56.130 --> 05:51:00.634]  And also, I believe there's, uh, we have a couple other ones, but you can call in and call us and tell us about it.
[05:51:00.634 --> 05:51:00.774]  877-789-ALEX.
[05:51:00.774 --> 05:51:00.954]  Hey, Dan.
[05:51:07.154 --> 05:51:08.698]  Dan, it's a little bit hard to hear you.
[05:51:08.698 --> 05:51:09.761]  I just wanted to clarify this.
[05:51:09.761 --> 05:51:15.455]  So you're saying that you had pictures printed out that we had and you were holding those up and they put clipboards up to cover that?
[05:51:15.455 --> 05:51:16.136]  Is that what you're saying?
[05:51:16.983 --> 05:51:17.423]  Absolutely.
[05:51:17.423 --> 05:51:18.824]  There are 8 by 10 glossy photos.
[05:51:18.824 --> 05:51:21.125]  You get the photos from Infowars.com.
[05:51:21.125 --> 05:51:25.267]  We presented them and of course, you know, they called the press conference.
[05:51:25.267 --> 05:51:29.469]  Dan, let me just stop you and repeat all this slowly because I understand you're on your cell and it's overdriving.
[05:51:29.469 --> 05:51:32.010]  They don't want the white redneck patsies.
[05:51:32.010 --> 05:51:34.391]  They probably already executed out there.
[05:51:34.391 --> 05:51:36.952]  They don't want the Navy SEALs.
[05:51:36.952 --> 05:51:37.813]  They are scared.
[05:51:37.813 --> 05:51:42.335]  I'm telling you folks, you get these articles out that are at Infowars.com.
[05:51:42.335 --> 05:51:44.456]  This is coffin nails for the tyranny.
[05:51:44.456 --> 05:51:44.896]  Go ahead, Dan.
[05:51:46.039 --> 05:51:55.803]  Man, if you noticed on the TV Alex, when I was doing this, the looks on these criminal faces, they jumped off that stage like, oh my god, we just got exposed to the world.
[05:51:55.803 --> 05:51:59.844]  Yeah, that's exactly what they looked like.
[05:51:59.844 --> 05:52:03.126]  We went mail, right through the heart of the New World Order this week.
[05:52:03.126 --> 05:52:04.746]  My one deal today, man.
[05:52:04.746 --> 05:52:08.788]  All your work you've been doing, Alex, day and night, you drove a snake through the heart of the New World Order.
[05:52:10.473 --> 05:52:12.234]  Alright, Dan, that's some good reporting.
[05:52:12.234 --> 05:52:17.938]  We're having a little bit of a difficulty hearing you, so maybe we can get back in touch with you at a later date, but definitely get us that footage.
[05:52:17.938 --> 05:52:20.480]  Alright, let me get some better reception here.
[05:52:20.480 --> 05:52:24.043]  Alright, I'll call you back.
[05:52:24.043 --> 05:52:25.644]  I got bad reception over here.
[05:52:25.644 --> 05:52:26.805]  Okay, he said he has bad reception.
[05:52:26.805 --> 05:52:28.226]  I think Alex is trying to talk to you.
[05:52:28.226 --> 05:52:29.267]  I'm on air now?
[05:52:29.267 --> 05:52:30.087]  I can hear you, Alex.
[05:52:30.087 --> 05:52:33.310]  Yeah, I'm in here in the studio, so... Listen, this is so exciting, folks.
[05:52:33.310 --> 05:52:34.430]  We're actually engaging people.
[05:52:34.430 --> 05:52:36.332]  Dan, are you using hands-free?
[05:52:40.353 --> 05:52:41.734]  What did he say?
[05:52:41.734 --> 05:52:43.955]  Sounds like somebody's talking to him.
[05:52:43.955 --> 05:52:44.415]  Dan.
[05:52:44.415 --> 05:52:48.617]  Badandi, are you on hands free?
[05:52:48.617 --> 05:52:49.057]  Hello Dan.
[05:52:49.057 --> 05:52:49.997]  I don't think he can hear me.
[05:52:49.997 --> 05:52:50.897]  I don't think it's piped through.
[05:52:50.897 --> 05:52:52.018]  No, he can't hear me either.
[05:52:52.018 --> 05:52:53.779]  Just tell him to get off hands free.
[05:52:53.779 --> 05:52:55.960]  I can't hear him, Alex.
[05:52:55.960 --> 05:52:56.940]  Can we just call him back?
[05:52:56.940 --> 05:52:57.860]  Can we hang up and call him back?
[05:53:00.051 --> 05:53:01.512]  Sounded like somebody said something to him.
[05:53:01.512 --> 05:53:01.632]  Yeah.
[05:53:01.632 --> 05:53:02.752]  I wonder if somebody cut him off.
[05:53:02.752 --> 05:53:02.892]  Yeah.
[05:53:02.892 --> 05:53:07.515]  All right, so can we just call him back and we'll try to re-establish a connection there with Dan Madani?
[05:53:07.515 --> 05:53:09.716]  No, cut the fact that this is a devastating victory.
[05:53:09.716 --> 05:53:11.757]  Let me tell you, dude, they are scared.
[05:53:11.757 --> 05:53:14.958]  He said, he said the police were like, you're going to be a good boy now, aren't you?
[05:53:14.958 --> 05:53:18.220]  They didn't want to make a scene about arresting him, but then point everybody at this.
[05:53:18.220 --> 05:53:20.861]  They're like, please don't look at other photos.
[05:53:20.861 --> 05:53:22.742]  We blew the kids up.
[05:53:22.742 --> 05:53:23.843]  Please, we murdered people.
[05:53:23.843 --> 05:53:25.023]  Please don't look at it.
[05:53:25.023 --> 05:53:25.924]  I mean, this is amazing.
[05:53:27.375 --> 05:53:31.039]  When you've got the government saying, please don't look here, where do you look?
[05:53:31.039 --> 05:53:32.300]  Right, exactly.
[05:53:32.300 --> 05:53:36.944]  There's nobody buried in the backyard, don't dig under the rose bushes!
[05:53:36.944 --> 05:53:38.826]  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[05:53:38.826 --> 05:53:39.266]  Exactly.
[05:53:39.266 --> 05:53:42.729]  Alright, so we're trying to re-establish connection with Dan Bodondi.
[05:53:42.729 --> 05:53:45.312]  In the meantime, Adam in Florida, continue your point.
[05:53:48.604 --> 05:53:59.409]  To again bring up a couple points, Alex just touched on one of them, but really what I want to get out, and again, with Napolitano, don't look at anything but what I give you.
[05:53:59.409 --> 05:54:03.250]  Make sure it's filtered before you report on it.
[05:54:03.250 --> 05:54:06.332]  I mean, anybody that knows anything about sociology, I'm not...
[05:54:07.142 --> 05:54:11.107]  You know, a sociology major, by any means, but at the same time, I study people.
[05:54:11.107 --> 05:54:12.388]  That's one of my hobbies.
[05:54:12.388 --> 05:54:23.020]  You know, anybody that plays poker, you know, I mean, you can just look at these people and tell their minds are going a mile a minute on how to keep everything, you know, down.
[05:54:23.020 --> 05:54:25.523]  They don't want any of this information leaking out.
[05:54:25.523 --> 05:54:28.366]  And again, I can't congratulate you guys on what you're doing enough.
[05:54:28.826 --> 05:54:29.347]  Well, thank you.
[05:54:29.347 --> 05:54:34.190]  They don't want the public to question it, and they don't want a congressman to question this either.
[05:54:34.190 --> 05:54:35.331]  Well, thanks for your call.
[05:54:35.331 --> 05:54:36.432]  We have to keep moving.
[05:54:36.432 --> 05:54:37.352]  Thank you for your call.
[05:54:37.352 --> 05:54:41.615]  We'll move on now to Marcus in Texas.
[05:54:41.615 --> 05:54:45.958]  Just, you know, sitting here listening to what's been going on.
[05:54:47.708 --> 05:54:53.930]  Originally my opinion was that not everything's a false flag, but maybe this one was real.
[05:54:53.930 --> 05:54:59.932]  But just listening in the last few minutes, this is really starting to look real to me.
[05:54:59.932 --> 05:55:06.534]  I'm a doubter because I'm a little bit cautious, and I guess there's probably nothing wrong with that.
[05:55:06.534 --> 05:55:15.357]  But anyhow, my main reason to call in was to try to inject a little bit of humor and make a comment about the gun reform defeat.
[05:55:16.824 --> 05:55:26.894]  And I'm looking at Yahoo News, and it says, Obama chastises Senate over failed gun reform amendment.
[05:55:26.894 --> 05:55:38.927]  If you scroll down to the, near the bottom of the page, just a second, let me, there's another subtitle, explore related content.
[05:55:39.787 --> 05:55:45.710]  And if you look, you see in the center, you see Obama and Joe Biden standing right beside him.
[05:55:45.710 --> 05:55:51.433]  And no kidding, I swear one of Jeff Dunham's puppets is missing.
[05:55:51.433 --> 05:55:56.456]  He looks exactly like Walter.
[05:55:56.456 --> 05:55:57.317]  Wow.
[05:55:57.317 --> 05:55:58.217]  OK, thank you for your call.
[05:55:58.217 --> 05:56:00.278]  We're almost to the end of our broadcast, so we're going to jump.
[05:56:00.278 --> 05:56:01.579]  Thank you for your call, Marcus.
[05:56:01.579 --> 05:56:03.520]  We'll move on to Rob in Indiana.
[05:56:06.007 --> 05:56:06.807]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[05:56:06.807 --> 05:56:07.848]  Rob, hang right there.
[05:56:07.848 --> 05:56:09.008]  We have Dan Badondi back.
[05:56:09.008 --> 05:56:12.509]  Dan, go ahead.
[05:56:12.509 --> 05:56:13.470]  Hello, Dan.
[05:56:13.470 --> 05:56:13.990]  Can you hear me?
[05:56:13.990 --> 05:56:15.571]  I can't hear him.
[05:56:15.571 --> 05:56:16.831]  Dan, are you there?
[05:56:16.831 --> 05:56:20.092]  He's talking to Alex's wife, Nadia Badondi.
[05:56:20.092 --> 05:56:22.233]  You're on the wrong line.
[05:56:22.233 --> 05:56:26.635]  I'm sorry, this is Dan's wife?
[05:56:26.635 --> 05:56:27.155]  Oh.
[05:56:27.155 --> 05:56:27.975]  Oh, okay.
[05:56:27.975 --> 05:56:29.236]  Does she want to talk to us?
[05:56:31.620 --> 05:56:35.882]  Yeah, I can hear the ringtone in my piece.
[05:56:35.882 --> 05:56:37.003]  Thank you guys.
[05:56:37.003 --> 05:56:38.523]  Just let us know when you get Dan back.
[05:56:38.523 --> 05:56:39.164]  Is he ready to go?
[05:56:39.164 --> 05:56:43.626]  Okay, they're still trying to get him back.
[05:56:43.626 --> 05:56:44.766]  Okay, Rob in Indiana.
[05:56:44.766 --> 05:56:47.648]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[05:56:47.648 --> 05:56:49.769]  Rob?
[05:56:49.769 --> 05:56:53.691]  I'd like to, first of all, say thank you for all the information you guys put out.
[05:56:53.691 --> 05:56:58.093]  I mean, honestly, a lot of people are so uninformed
[05:56:58.852 --> 05:56:59.092]  Of course!
[05:57:16.348 --> 05:57:18.869]  Okay, I'm sorry, sir, can you get to the chase?
[05:57:18.869 --> 05:57:19.689]  We're short on time.
[05:57:19.689 --> 05:57:20.550]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:57:20.550 --> 05:57:21.110]  Okay.
[05:57:21.110 --> 05:57:32.975]  Well, when you look at the pictures of the potential SEAL gentlemen, they have khaki pants, they're wearing black jackets, and one's actually wearing a black hat with a white mark on it.
[05:57:32.975 --> 05:57:33.195]  Right.
[05:57:33.195 --> 05:57:40.658]  Now, doesn't it seem obvious when you're trying to create a deception that you would have more than one person dressed alike?
[05:57:40.658 --> 05:57:41.318]  Mm-hmm.
[05:57:41.318 --> 05:57:43.159]  Just so you can't pin it on anybody.
[05:57:43.655 --> 05:57:45.698]  Okay, I'm sorry Rob, we're going to have to put you back on hold.
[05:57:45.698 --> 05:57:47.561]  We have Dan Badondi back on the scene.
[05:57:47.561 --> 05:57:48.242]  Dan, can you hear me?
[05:57:48.242 --> 05:57:50.125]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[05:57:50.125 --> 05:57:54.071]  Okay, so it sounded like somebody was talking to you when we lost contact?
[05:57:54.071 --> 05:57:56.836]  Yeah, we were still getting reported by the press out here.
[05:57:56.836 --> 05:57:58.218]  I'm in my car right now.
[05:57:58.218 --> 05:57:58.659]  Okay.
[05:57:59.326 --> 05:58:04.631]  I mean, like, I got my buddies out here showing the photographs, and, uh, it's just, like, it was, like, amazing.
[05:58:04.631 --> 05:58:06.973]  Again, uh, they quickly avoided the question.
[05:58:06.973 --> 05:58:12.618]  I mean, the thing is, if these things weren't true, why would they rush and say, hey, you know, we got proof it's not?
[05:58:12.618 --> 05:58:16.901]  After you choose to avoid it, give you dirty looks, then they call it, they cancel the press conference.
[05:58:16.901 --> 05:58:18.663]  The woman comes on stage, it's over.
[05:58:18.663 --> 05:58:23.247]  You know, and, uh, it was, like, a couple minutes into the question, and not even, and they refused to answer my questions.
[05:58:24.703 --> 05:58:29.765]  Now did you see, I didn't see on the stage, was the Governor or the Mayor or anybody else you talked to there?
[05:58:29.765 --> 05:58:34.926]  I didn't see the Governor, but the FBI Director, he was here, he was actually charged anyway.
[05:58:34.926 --> 05:58:41.108]  AT&T, there was a bunch of friends that were here, basically, all the friends who were here, their leaders, whoever they are.
[05:58:42.208 --> 05:58:46.370]  And Dan, Dan, they don't put all those people on the podium just to have them stand there.
[05:58:46.370 --> 05:58:48.311]  They're going to let some of those other people speak as well.
[05:58:48.311 --> 05:58:49.311]  That was the original plan.
[05:58:49.311 --> 05:58:50.932]  So you did shut that press conference down.
[05:58:50.932 --> 05:58:53.193]  Yeah, because he said, uh, oh, here's Alex.
[05:58:53.193 --> 05:58:55.454]  Dan, you have shut down all three press conferences.
[05:58:55.454 --> 05:58:56.854]  Now you've got to call Luke Rodowski.
[05:58:56.854 --> 05:59:00.736]  We should link up with him and like have 15 people in there next time.
[05:59:00.736 --> 05:59:02.557]  Cause they're going to try to drag you out.
[05:59:02.557 --> 05:59:03.137]  It doesn't matter.
[05:59:03.137 --> 05:59:04.717]  It just shows how it's one man.
[05:59:04.717 --> 05:59:07.939]  These people, these crooks just run everything and no one resists them.
[05:59:08.659 --> 05:59:10.280]  One man, Dan Badundi.
[05:59:10.280 --> 05:59:12.322]  One man, Dan Badundi.
[05:59:12.322 --> 05:59:15.865]  I mean, I mean, it's just like we're on them like stink on you-know-what.
[05:59:15.865 --> 05:59:16.465]  Yeah.
[05:59:16.465 --> 05:59:17.766]  And it is on, man.
[05:59:17.766 --> 05:59:20.328]  I mean, well done, Lord Vader.
[05:59:20.328 --> 05:59:21.209]  Excellent.
[05:59:21.209 --> 05:59:21.589]  Excellent.
[05:59:21.589 --> 05:59:22.110]  Thank you, Alex.
[05:59:22.110 --> 05:59:24.631]  So you said... Rick Rydowski is on his way as we speak.
[05:59:24.631 --> 05:59:25.272]  Oh, yeah.
[05:59:25.272 --> 05:59:26.273]  This is gonna be good.
[05:59:27.301 --> 05:59:28.982]  Man, we're battling the enemy hard.
[05:59:28.982 --> 05:59:29.382]  That's right.
[05:59:29.382 --> 05:59:30.302]  That's where it needs to be.
[05:59:30.302 --> 05:59:33.223]  That guy called earlier and he wanted to know how to get on there.
[05:59:33.223 --> 05:59:35.184]  Go to Boston right now if you're listening.
[05:59:35.184 --> 05:59:36.325]  Yes.
[05:59:36.325 --> 05:59:37.485]  Get out of your basement.
[05:59:37.485 --> 05:59:42.307]  Get away from your computer and go to Boston and start getting in the face of people and starting asking people questions.
[05:59:42.307 --> 05:59:46.849]  By the way, Control Wars is getting double the traffic it's ever gotten.
[05:59:47.429 --> 05:59:50.371]  We broke the record a few days ago, now it's double that.
[05:59:50.371 --> 06:00:00.619]  Right now, smoke is coming out of it, out of the servers and fire, and Watson just went up with a deal of FBI ignores, ignores men with backpacks, but that's not even the issue.
[06:00:00.619 --> 06:00:04.742]  That's a great headline by Watson working around the clock, it's like midnight where he's at.
[06:00:04.742 --> 06:00:05.723]  It's even worse than that.
[06:00:06.563 --> 06:00:11.408]  This is the FBI saying, never mind all the real suspects, because it's their people.
[06:00:11.408 --> 06:00:12.909]  We have them.
[06:00:12.909 --> 06:00:14.151]  That is them panicking.
[06:00:14.151 --> 06:00:17.374]  Please media, don't look at InfoWars or Drudge!
[06:00:17.374 --> 06:00:18.195]  Whatever you do!
[06:00:18.854 --> 06:00:22.077]  Yeah, that's like you tell the kids, don't do that, then they go and do it.
[06:00:22.077 --> 06:00:25.800]  But I mean, if it was BS, they would just say, oh whatever, this is what we think.
[06:00:25.800 --> 06:00:27.661]  No, it's like, don't look there.
[06:00:27.661 --> 06:00:31.564]  And they're begging the media, play ball with us now, we'll patch you on the head.
[06:00:31.564 --> 06:00:32.505]  That's right.
[06:00:32.505 --> 06:00:32.966]  Exactly.
[06:00:32.966 --> 06:00:34.066]  That's right.
[06:00:34.066 --> 06:00:36.468]  Go for five more minutes with the Donnie than you did.
[06:00:36.468 --> 06:00:39.791]  Take a break and restart recordings, you know, just as we're live.
[06:00:39.791 --> 06:00:41.272]  It's filling up the data thing.
[06:00:41.272 --> 06:00:44.395]  And if you guys can come back on if you want, if the crew wants, you can have a vote on it.
[06:00:44.395 --> 06:00:46.537]  If not, seven o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[06:00:47.077 --> 06:00:51.318]  Okay, alright Dan, we're going to wrap up with you and then we'll try to give maybe Rob one minute.
[06:00:51.318 --> 06:00:52.458]  Five minutes, he can have as many as he wants.
[06:00:52.458 --> 06:00:55.039]  Okay, alright Dan, just let's start from the beginning.
[06:00:55.039 --> 06:00:57.139]  Just tell us your whole story and your words.
[06:00:57.139 --> 06:01:00.920]  First of all, the hotel is the Sheraton on Dalton Street in Boston.
[06:01:00.920 --> 06:01:02.881]  It's right next to the Hilton, you can't miss it.
[06:01:02.881 --> 06:01:05.581]  Again, I think it's 40 or whatever it is.
[06:01:05.581 --> 06:01:07.382]  It's the Hilton, right next to the Hilton.
[06:01:07.382 --> 06:01:10.382]  It's called the Sheraton Hotel on Dalton Street in Boston, Mass.
[06:01:10.382 --> 06:01:12.483]  Everyone, get out here, ask questions.
[06:01:12.483 --> 06:01:12.983]  We need you.
[06:01:14.153 --> 06:01:15.395]  We're still at the hotel now.
[06:01:15.395 --> 06:01:17.958]  We're outside the grounds here.
[06:01:17.958 --> 06:01:21.341]  We're just informing people as they're walking, showing them the pictures.
[06:01:21.341 --> 06:01:23.344]  We've got the videos rolling.
[06:01:23.344 --> 06:01:25.306]  If you want me to start over?
[06:01:25.306 --> 06:01:29.791]  We asked the questions and they got ignored, so I kept pushing the questions.
[06:01:29.791 --> 06:01:31.653]  They quickly jumped on stage.
[06:01:31.653 --> 06:01:33.596]  The same woman canceled the press conference.
[06:01:34.236 --> 06:01:38.499]  All the men fleed off the stage with their hands between their legs, because they knew they were in danger.
[06:01:38.499 --> 06:01:40.180]  And if you notice, right?
[06:01:40.180 --> 06:01:43.102]  I'll say this again in case you didn't hear me earlier.
[06:01:43.102 --> 06:01:48.545]  When the photos were given to me, because my friend arrived late, the FBI agent scared out of them.
[06:01:48.545 --> 06:01:53.028]  I heard the FBI agent in the hallway say they got photographs, because we were being watched the whole time.
[06:01:53.028 --> 06:01:59.432]  That's why when he first came out, right away he stated, don't ignore our photographs, except for our FBI photographs on the website.
[06:02:03.660 --> 06:02:06.361]  Yeah, beware, Dan is armed with photographs.
[06:02:06.361 --> 06:02:09.122]  I know, it's like this man has photographic evidence.
[06:02:09.122 --> 06:02:10.503]  He's in the info war.
[06:02:10.503 --> 06:02:11.483]  Alright Dan, so go ahead.
[06:02:11.483 --> 06:02:13.885]  You said it was a reporter who put a clipboard in your way?
[06:02:23.931 --> 06:02:26.832]  Yeah, I don't know if he's a reporter or some agent or whatever.
[06:02:26.832 --> 06:02:29.373]  We are a government agent, reporter, whatever.
[06:02:29.373 --> 06:02:32.935]  He's trying to block my pictures with the clipboard from all the cameras.
[06:02:32.935 --> 06:02:34.775]  He didn't succeed with that, of course.
[06:02:34.775 --> 06:02:36.116]  Yeah.
[06:02:36.116 --> 06:02:37.176]  Okay.
[06:02:37.176 --> 06:02:40.878]  Alright, so then... I'm sorry if I'm like... No, you sound good.
[06:02:40.878 --> 06:02:43.679]  I just want to hear your whole story from the beginning and the time we have.
[06:02:43.679 --> 06:02:47.040]  So the press conference begins and just tell us your view.
[06:02:47.040 --> 06:02:48.921]  Our press conference begins again right away.
[06:02:48.921 --> 06:02:49.501]  They had to stay.
[06:02:50.589 --> 06:02:56.712]  Don't pay attention to any other photos except for ours, because God forbid you like to, uh, you know, look for truth.
[06:02:56.712 --> 06:02:58.912]  And, um, because you've seen the photos we had.
[06:02:58.912 --> 06:03:02.934]  Well, they've seen a stack of photos, so they kind of... Hi, we're the FBI.
[06:03:02.934 --> 06:03:08.016]  Whatever you do, don't look at these other photos of our people with the bombs!
[06:03:08.016 --> 06:03:08.897]  Yep.
[06:03:08.897 --> 06:03:18.340]  And, uh, we got bombarded by the press, uh, I think it was some foreign media there, that were actually questioning taking the video photos of our photos, and wanted to hear everything we had to say.
[06:03:18.340 --> 06:03:19.401]  And they were very interested.
[06:03:20.191 --> 06:03:24.873]  Because unlike, you know, dumbed down mainstream media, uh, you know, foreigners love this stuff, man.
[06:03:24.873 --> 06:03:26.353]  They love to hear the truth, man.
[06:03:26.353 --> 06:03:27.914]  Uh, you know, of course, we're one of the peaceful ones.
[06:03:27.914 --> 06:03:29.495]  We've got a worldwide audience.
[06:03:29.495 --> 06:03:31.435]  And that's why we're number one in the world.
[06:03:31.435 --> 06:03:34.817]  Because we've got a bunch of great people out there who search for the truth.
[06:03:34.817 --> 06:03:41.219]  And, um, you know, it's just, it's amazing that we just sucker punch, not even sucker punch, we blasted the New World Order right in the heart.
[06:03:41.704 --> 06:03:46.666]  Well, they have a lot of influence with the mainstream media because the mainstream media wants access to them.
[06:03:46.666 --> 06:03:48.967]  They want to be called on when it's time to ask questions.
[06:03:48.967 --> 06:03:50.108]  So they're going to play nice.
[06:03:50.108 --> 06:03:53.049]  They're going to do whatever the FBI and the government tells them to do.
[06:03:53.049 --> 06:03:58.691]  And that's why the foreign press is interested in digging into this and finding out what the truth is.
[06:03:58.691 --> 06:04:00.152]  And that's why we're interested.
[06:04:00.152 --> 06:04:03.073]  We're more interested in the truth than we are about position.
[06:04:03.479 --> 06:04:07.480]  By the way, Dan, you getting InfoWars.com out on every network?
[06:04:07.480 --> 06:04:08.601]  I said double the traffic.
[06:04:08.601 --> 06:04:09.741]  That was earlier in the report.
[06:04:09.741 --> 06:04:11.722]  It's like 50 times the traffic.
[06:04:11.722 --> 06:04:15.923]  We're getting a million visitors every couple minutes right now.
[06:04:15.923 --> 06:04:16.743]  Are you serious?
[06:04:16.743 --> 06:04:17.864]  No, no, no.
[06:04:17.864 --> 06:04:21.065]  It's 100,000k new people every 60 seconds.
[06:04:21.065 --> 06:04:21.825]  Wow.
[06:04:21.825 --> 06:04:26.306]  The IT guys, this is probably the number one website in the world just during this window.
[06:04:26.306 --> 06:04:26.686]  Wow.
[06:04:26.686 --> 06:04:28.507]  It is 100,000k new joining who's already on it.
[06:04:32.700 --> 06:04:35.461]  This isn't hits, these are visitors every minute.
[06:04:35.461 --> 06:04:36.201]  Wow.
[06:04:36.201 --> 06:04:38.902]  We're watching the New World Order burn down.
[06:04:38.902 --> 06:04:42.603]  Of course, the enemy starts towards us.
[06:04:42.603 --> 06:04:49.665]  One of the groups we have, we have a group here that joined me, and he was one of my camera guys.
[06:04:54.867 --> 06:05:00.328]  Well, it's called the Free American Patriots Movement, and his name is Nick Marshall.
[06:05:00.328 --> 06:05:02.329]  Nick Marshall, I should say.
[06:05:02.329 --> 06:05:05.770]  He was one of my camera guys, and he braved right through the storm.
[06:05:05.770 --> 06:05:10.891]  And, I mean, my other party, Kevin LaPre, yeah, I just want to give a shout-out to them, because they're covering my butt right now.
[06:05:10.891 --> 06:05:13.432]  They've got little cameras all over me the whole time.
[06:05:13.432 --> 06:05:16.112]  And we were filming an event... Great.
[06:05:20.177 --> 06:05:29.685]  Before the event started, officials came and said, we need to clear the room, everybody leave your bags and belongings in the room, then they do a search of the room.
[06:05:29.685 --> 06:05:35.810]  So I had my camera crew film the contents of my, under our chairs, every which way the cameras are set up.
[06:05:35.810 --> 06:05:39.433]  This way, because we know, you know, just in case there's a plan of an honor.
[06:05:39.433 --> 06:05:43.977]  So we covered our butt, and one of the military was trying to tell our guys to shut the cameras off.
[06:05:43.977 --> 06:05:44.538]  Of course we did.
[06:05:45.390 --> 06:05:48.156]  And I asked him, are you the Army guy?
[06:05:48.156 --> 06:05:49.578]  I said, are you doing the security check?
[06:05:49.578 --> 06:05:50.560]  He goes, yes, I am.
[06:05:50.560 --> 06:05:53.346]  And I asked him, are you a posse comitatus?
[06:05:53.346 --> 06:05:54.388]  He goes, no, I didn't.
[06:05:54.388 --> 06:05:55.690]  You know, I bet you're in the military.
[06:05:55.690 --> 06:05:56.932]  You should know the Constitution, yeah.
[06:05:58.170 --> 06:06:00.191]  And one more thing before you go.
[06:06:22.216 --> 06:06:34.886]  I just want to say, I read some articles lately, and there's articles stating forever, no matter what, mainstream media could never again ignore false flags, and they also could never again rule out a government as a possible suspect.
[06:06:34.886 --> 06:06:38.868]  We have dented this into the minds and hearts of American people.
[06:06:38.868 --> 06:06:42.411]  And the truth, again, the truth will never be held back.
[06:06:42.411 --> 06:06:43.992]  The truth will always be revealed.
[06:06:43.992 --> 06:06:44.933]  Great job, Dan.
[06:06:44.933 --> 06:06:48.776]  And if we can stop that technique of false flags, you've saved a lot of lives.
[06:06:50.316 --> 06:06:51.237]  Thank you.
[06:06:51.237 --> 06:06:54.639]  Thanks to all these guys for getting these pictures out.
[06:06:54.639 --> 06:06:56.761]  We're all a team here.
[06:06:56.761 --> 06:07:03.006]  The credit goes to every one of us, especially Alex, who's worked day and night, working in his sleep.
[06:07:03.006 --> 06:07:05.988]  Alex is amazing.
[06:07:05.988 --> 06:07:07.609]  My hat's off to all you guys.
[06:07:07.609 --> 06:07:08.710]  Great job, Dan.
[06:07:08.710 --> 06:07:10.111]  We'll talk to you soon.
[06:07:10.111 --> 06:07:11.753]  God bless you.
[06:07:11.753 --> 06:07:12.914]  There goes Dan Badani.
[06:07:12.914 --> 06:07:15.335]  Let's go ahead and finish up with Rob in Indiana.
[06:07:15.335 --> 06:07:18.298]  Sorry for the long wait, but go ahead with your point, Rob.
[06:07:19.039 --> 06:07:20.481]  Hey, that was awesome, actually.
[06:07:20.481 --> 06:07:21.883]  How about that?
[06:07:21.883 --> 06:07:23.825]  Actually, I would like to say one thing.
[06:07:23.825 --> 06:07:27.850]  Alex, if you can hear me, I'd like to tell you thank you.
[06:07:27.850 --> 06:07:32.496]  For all the information that you're putting out, it really does make a difference.
[06:07:32.496 --> 06:07:36.882]  So, if that means anything to you, that's just a true, honest thank you.
[06:07:37.429 --> 06:07:43.030]  The other thing is, I'll get back to my point, and I'll make this really quick and I'll be on.
[06:07:43.030 --> 06:07:47.412]  There is a lot of similarities between what those two gentlemen were wearing.
[06:07:47.412 --> 06:07:50.853]  They both had khaki pants, they both had black jackets.
[06:07:50.853 --> 06:07:55.714]  One had a black hat with a white emblem on it, the other one had a black hat with a white emblem on it.
[06:07:55.714 --> 06:07:58.074]  They both carried backpacks.
[06:07:58.074 --> 06:08:00.615]  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.
[06:08:00.615 --> 06:08:02.976]  Maybe I'm overseeing too much in this.
[06:08:04.420 --> 06:08:08.404]  Sure sounds like they're trying to create a diversion.
[06:08:08.404 --> 06:08:09.345]  That's all.
[06:08:09.345 --> 06:08:11.266]  And then, I'll finish up with this.
[06:08:11.266 --> 06:08:16.772]  I'll say it's a dang shame that we've become what we've fought to get away from.
[06:08:16.772 --> 06:08:18.954]  That's all I've got to say.
[06:08:19.659 --> 06:08:24.961]  That is always the challenge, that you don't become the monsters that you fight.
[06:08:24.961 --> 06:08:25.361]  Exactly.
[06:08:25.361 --> 06:08:33.844]  Alright guys, I know we wanted to call it at 5, but Alex says we are now the number one news site in the world, or close to it.
[06:08:33.844 --> 06:08:34.644]  Can we do 530?
[06:08:34.644 --> 06:08:37.425]  I don't want to go all the way to 7, but can we do 530?
[06:08:37.425 --> 06:08:40.826]  Alright, we'll go to 530, we'll go continue with the calls.
[06:08:40.826 --> 06:08:43.047]  Diane in Louisiana, you are on the air.
[06:08:44.232 --> 06:08:44.953]  Hi, David.
[06:08:44.953 --> 06:08:45.694]  Hi, Jakari.
[06:08:45.694 --> 06:08:47.015]  Hey, how are you doing?
[06:08:47.015 --> 06:08:48.076]  I'm good.
[06:08:48.076 --> 06:08:54.081]  There was a caller earlier who mentioned he was from Louisiana and was talking about the black helicopters.
[06:08:54.081 --> 06:08:54.901]  Yes.
[06:08:54.901 --> 06:09:01.547]  Well, the night Alex Jones was on Coast to Coast, I pulled up an article ran by by, you know, accident.
[06:09:01.547 --> 06:09:03.529]  They are having drills.
[06:09:03.529 --> 06:09:06.171]  They are scheduled for New Orleans.
[06:09:06.171 --> 06:09:07.092]  They didn't give a date.
[06:09:07.679 --> 06:09:13.981]  But they're letting the residents know that there will be some drills in New Orleans.
[06:09:13.981 --> 06:09:18.183]  So I'm thinking maybe Alex can get in touch with his friend, Charles.
[06:09:18.183 --> 06:09:21.604]  Now do you know anything specific about the drills?
[06:09:21.604 --> 06:09:25.025]  No, I don't, but you can pick it up at www.neworleanshow.com
[06:09:27.672 --> 06:09:29.993]  W-R-N-O dot com.
[06:09:29.993 --> 06:09:31.454]  W-R-N-O?
[06:09:31.454 --> 06:09:31.774]  Right.
[06:09:31.774 --> 06:09:33.354]  Can we look that up right now, guys?
[06:09:33.354 --> 06:09:35.275]  Local TV or radio station.
[06:09:35.275 --> 06:09:36.015]  Okay.
[06:09:36.015 --> 06:09:36.295]  Right.
[06:09:36.295 --> 06:09:37.416]  It's for the local news.
[06:09:37.416 --> 06:09:39.037]  And it was a headline.
[06:09:39.037 --> 06:09:41.177]  They didn't go into a whole lot of details.
[06:09:41.177 --> 06:09:45.119]  But they was letting the residents know that they will be doing drills in New Orleans.
[06:09:45.677 --> 06:09:48.660]  But they did not give a date as to when.
[06:09:48.660 --> 06:09:51.482]  Okay, well hopefully they won't be going door-to-door like they did.
[06:09:51.482 --> 06:09:54.324]  So that's probably why he's in the black helicopters.
[06:09:54.324 --> 06:09:55.485]  Yeah, I'm with David.
[06:09:55.485 --> 06:09:57.047]  I hope they don't go door-to-door.
[06:09:57.047 --> 06:09:58.087]  Thank you for your call.
[06:09:58.087 --> 06:09:59.168]  The number to call in is 877-789-ALEX.
[06:09:59.168 --> 06:09:59.449]  That is 877-789-2539.
[06:09:59.449 --> 06:10:00.710]  We're only going to 530 Central Time.
[06:10:00.710 --> 06:10:01.270]  It's about 510 right now.
[06:10:01.270 --> 06:10:02.471]  So we'll try to blaze through these calls.
[06:10:02.471 --> 06:10:03.512]  Let's go to Steve in Florida.
[06:10:14.540 --> 06:10:15.961]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon.
[06:10:15.961 --> 06:10:22.886]  A couple things I want to cover real quick in relation to this so-called news conference that I picked up on watching it.
[06:10:22.886 --> 06:10:28.250]  First of all, the appearance of the arrogance of the FBI spokesman.
[06:10:28.250 --> 06:10:30.192]  I mean, he had it written all over his face.
[06:10:30.192 --> 06:10:37.017]  And did you notice the Freudian flip of the tongue where he was referring to the victims and talking about their investigation?
[06:10:37.017 --> 06:10:39.298]  They deserve nothing more.
[06:10:39.298 --> 06:10:42.001]  And then he switched to, I mean, nothing less.
[06:10:42.001 --> 06:10:43.622]  I believe that was done on purpose.
[06:10:44.262 --> 06:10:49.246]  And I also wanted to say that, you know, to me, this whole news conference was about one thing.
[06:10:49.246 --> 06:10:52.188]  It wasn't about them saying, you know, we're investigating.
[06:10:52.188 --> 06:11:01.716]  This was a direct shot at Alex Jones at InfoWars.com, because you notice as soon as Badandi mentioned InfoWars, they immediately shut him down.
[06:11:01.716 --> 06:11:06.339]  The thing about, we're not going to have anybody looking, nobody should look at any other photos.
[06:11:06.339 --> 06:11:06.659]  Why?
[06:11:06.659 --> 06:11:12.564]  Because yesterday, everything Alex had out about the photos of the seals, et cetera,
[06:11:13.104 --> 06:11:16.345]  I really believe that's the main reason they put this out.
[06:11:16.345 --> 06:11:26.589]  And finally, I just wanted to say, you know, what you guys have been doing there with Info Wars, I would relate that to carpet bombing in a war.
[06:11:26.589 --> 06:11:34.212]  You've gone to Smart Bomb, and here you've got precision hit by Dan, the Bomb D, and his Smart Bomb approach.
[06:11:35.515 --> 06:11:49.167]  And I want to say that what we ought to do is title what the New World Order is doing as, in relation to what happened Monday, the Obama Marathon, the New World Order Race for the Curse.
[06:11:49.167 --> 06:11:49.547]  Yes.
[06:11:49.547 --> 06:11:53.350]  Not for the cure, but for the curse.
[06:11:53.350 --> 06:11:55.572]  Alright, thank you for your call.
[06:11:55.572 --> 06:11:57.734]  The phone lines are lighting up, so let's move quick.
[06:11:57.734 --> 06:11:59.155]  We have Jim in Georgia.
[06:11:59.155 --> 06:12:01.477]  Yes, sir.
[06:12:01.477 --> 06:12:02.098]  Yes, go ahead, sir.
[06:12:02.890 --> 06:12:04.431]  Much love to you guys.
[06:12:04.431 --> 06:12:06.413]  Thank you so much for your work.
[06:12:06.413 --> 06:12:08.875]  And I don't care if anybody wants to hear thank you or not.
[06:12:08.875 --> 06:12:10.076]  I'm going to tell you.
[06:12:10.076 --> 06:12:10.956]  All of you.
[06:12:10.956 --> 06:12:11.877]  Thank you.
[06:12:11.877 --> 06:12:12.378]  Thank you.
[06:12:12.378 --> 06:12:14.800]  So, I ran into Alex years ago.
[06:12:14.800 --> 06:12:22.526]  About six years ago, I finally got the courage to look into my questions about 9-11.
[06:12:22.526 --> 06:12:25.888]  And I read across depleted uranium.
[06:12:25.888 --> 06:12:28.170]  There's quite a study on that.
[06:12:28.170 --> 06:12:30.272]  If people don't have the courage to look it up,
[06:12:30.965 --> 06:12:33.367]  I mean, I don't know what to say for them.
[06:12:33.367 --> 06:12:41.332]  But anyhow, the truth is, the best news source I've ever gotten is InfoWars.com.
[06:12:41.332 --> 06:12:41.772]  Well, thank you.
[06:12:41.772 --> 06:12:42.472]  Definitely.
[06:12:42.472 --> 06:12:43.313]  Hands down.
[06:12:43.313 --> 06:12:45.534]  Now, here's the thing.
[06:12:45.534 --> 06:12:50.237]  The FBI trying to take control of the narrative?
[06:12:50.237 --> 06:12:53.559]  Look, all you have to do is call them and yell at them.
[06:12:53.559 --> 06:12:53.880]  Tell them.
[06:12:54.628 --> 06:13:02.334]  What are you doing trying to control this narrative and trying to tell me that my eyes... See, I am the real Homeland Security.
[06:13:02.334 --> 06:13:05.537]  So are you, and so is everybody else out there.
[06:13:05.537 --> 06:13:07.839]  They don't control anything.
[06:13:07.839 --> 06:13:12.002]  And I'm so sick of them trying to control the narrative.
[06:13:12.002 --> 06:13:13.123]  This is bullcrap.
[06:13:13.123 --> 06:13:15.205]  We can solve this.
[06:13:15.205 --> 06:13:19.408]  And not just the FBI and Napolitano saying, we'll tell you what to believe.
[06:13:19.408 --> 06:13:22.351]  We'll tell you when you have credible information because you'll get it from us.
[06:13:22.611 --> 06:13:25.213]  And she's telling that to the congressman.
[06:13:25.213 --> 06:13:29.175]  What it reminds me of is what they do when there's a disaster.
[06:13:29.175 --> 06:13:38.321]  And FEMA comes in and basically creates this incredible bottleneck and shuts down all efforts to aid people because they don't allow any local help to happen.
[06:13:38.321 --> 06:13:46.506]  And it's real interesting, when I've seen disasters, if it's a large scale, they bring in FEMA and it basically shuts everything down.
[06:13:46.926 --> 06:13:49.567]  But a smaller-scale disaster, people chip in.
[06:13:49.567 --> 06:13:58.431]  You've got the local police will keep people away from downed power lines, and then churches and businesses will distribute food and clothing to each other.
[06:13:58.431 --> 06:14:00.111]  Things work when they don't get in the way and shut it down.
[06:14:00.111 --> 06:14:02.833]  They're trying to break the normal human instinct to work together.
[06:14:02.833 --> 06:14:03.313]  That's right.
[06:14:03.313 --> 06:14:04.453]  That's why you turn to MSNBC.
[06:14:04.453 --> 06:14:10.916]  It's all race, religion, fight with each other, because they're globalists waging war on humans.
[06:14:10.916 --> 06:14:12.076]  You can see it right there.
[06:14:12.076 --> 06:14:13.357]  And again,
[06:14:15.455 --> 06:14:28.553]  The responsibility we've got right now, because I'm going to be able to go in there and tape, and then also, if you guys want to do The Nightly News tonight live, I mean I did the interview with the guy that took his guns up by Temple, and I was going to do some of the show live, I'll be honest with you, I finally got some sleep last night, I'm a little bit tired.
[06:14:28.553 --> 06:14:31.196]  This all just needs to keep getting covered, this crew's about to fall over.
[06:14:31.196 --> 06:14:31.356]  Yeah.
[06:14:31.977 --> 06:14:41.862]  But I'm telling you, we could just go over there and when we're ready, punch out maybe at six, and then play the clips of Badandi and all this, because imagine, don't look at this, don't look at anything but what we're showing you!
[06:14:41.862 --> 06:14:48.206]  I mean, I think that's a miscalculation, but look at the evidence of their control over mainstream media.
[06:14:48.726 --> 06:14:49.126]  Oh yeah.
[06:14:49.126 --> 06:14:52.869]  That there's only drudge and that's getting brought up in Congress now and there's us.
[06:14:52.869 --> 06:14:55.891]  And no one else is even there to let go.
[06:14:55.891 --> 06:14:58.613]  Who are all these other people with backpacks all around?
[06:14:58.613 --> 06:15:00.374]  I was looking at Navy SEAL photos.
[06:15:00.374 --> 06:15:01.515]  I kept saying like 20 yards.
[06:15:01.515 --> 06:15:04.877]  It's more like 15 feet from the bomb.
[06:15:04.877 --> 06:15:05.598]  From the spot.
[06:15:05.598 --> 06:15:08.360]  I mean they're right there and they're looking at where the guy's at.
[06:15:09.366 --> 06:15:10.807]  I mean, they did this!
[06:15:10.807 --> 06:15:12.168]  And of course they don't want to be seen!
[06:15:12.168 --> 06:15:14.249]  They killed that little 8-year-old kid!
[06:15:14.249 --> 06:15:14.629]  And you know what?
[06:15:14.629 --> 06:15:16.950]  You want to show me that kid and make me be emotional so I can get my rights up?
[06:15:16.950 --> 06:15:17.250]  You know what?
[06:15:17.250 --> 06:15:18.451]  I am emotional, you murderers.
[06:15:18.451 --> 06:15:19.872]  That's right.
[06:15:19.872 --> 06:15:21.012]  But damn, they're all in on it, man.
[06:15:21.012 --> 06:15:22.653]  You watch this, I say, oh, maybe they don't know.
[06:15:22.653 --> 06:15:23.774]  No, they're in on it.
[06:15:23.774 --> 06:15:24.754]  They're all in on it.
[06:15:24.754 --> 06:15:26.095]  A bunch of killers, man.
[06:15:26.095 --> 06:15:26.956]  Yeah.
[06:15:26.956 --> 06:15:27.376]  You know what?
[06:15:27.376 --> 06:15:28.196]  And you know what?
[06:15:28.196 --> 06:15:31.558]  There's still men left in the world, you bastards!
[06:15:31.558 --> 06:15:32.418]  There's Alex Jones.
[06:15:32.418 --> 06:15:32.979]  Thank you for your time.
[06:15:32.979 --> 06:15:33.659]  What do you want to say to them?
[06:15:33.659 --> 06:15:34.500]  They're watching right now.
[06:15:34.500 --> 06:15:36.421]  Because I said today I was going to have a message to the New World Order.
[06:15:36.421 --> 06:15:37.061]  I didn't do it.
[06:15:37.061 --> 06:15:38.762]  What do you want to say to them, Jakari, out there watching?
[06:15:39.974 --> 06:15:41.436]  What do you want to say, David, both of you?
[06:15:41.436 --> 06:15:45.723]  I mean, the people that killed those people, it's nothing in a few dead collateral damage.
[06:15:45.723 --> 06:15:47.005]  You know, we're not humans.
[06:15:47.005 --> 06:15:48.166]  They're watching right now.
[06:15:49.252 --> 06:15:50.894]  What you said is exactly right.
[06:15:50.894 --> 06:15:52.515]  We need to be concerned about the loss of life.
[06:15:52.515 --> 06:16:10.534]  And you know, one of the things, I think Dan getting in their face and getting this false flag stuff out there, I believe that they have repeatedly, and all of us here, we've looked at 9-11 and these other events, we believe that they've repeatedly staged mass murder attacks to forward a political agenda to get people, and we've got to stop that tactic from working.
[06:16:10.874 --> 06:16:14.318]  And the way you do that is get the information out there and tell people what they're doing.
[06:16:14.318 --> 06:16:20.726]  And people should get angry about this because, like Alex said, we want to follow this trail to wherever the murderers are.
[06:16:20.726 --> 06:16:21.026]  Exactly.
[06:16:21.026 --> 06:16:23.369]  Because there are some horrible people out there.
[06:16:23.369 --> 06:16:25.271]  We need to find out who these people really are.
[06:16:26.432 --> 06:16:41.635]  And it reminds me, I've been talking about this lately, when Alex did an interview with Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins, Billy said, Alex, you guys are great at information and dates and numbers, but the thing you don't really connect with people with is on emotion.
[06:16:41.635 --> 06:16:48.116]  And we talk about, you know, the bombs, demand action and all this, and they're not going so much off of numbers, they're going over emotion.
[06:16:48.116 --> 06:16:51.377]  Where was I when I heard the Sandy Hook kids got killed?
[06:16:51.377 --> 06:16:53.277]  I was driving to my grandma's house, so I was making
[06:16:53.957 --> 06:16:54.358]  I don't know.
[06:17:10.740 --> 06:17:17.387]  And, you know, we say the number is relatively small, which it is relatively small, three people, but those were three people whose lives have been lost.
[06:17:17.387 --> 06:17:23.073]  And people whose lives have been changed because they've been injured physically, emotionally, spiritually.
[06:17:23.073 --> 06:17:28.539]  Go back to September 11th, the event that they used to fundamentally alter society and our country.
[06:17:29.279 --> 06:17:40.926]  And think about the fact that they shut down the crime scene, that they shipped this evidence abroad as we mentioned earlier tonight, that they obstructed justice, that they, you know, have shut this down.
[06:17:40.926 --> 06:17:43.208]  Why aren't people more upset about that?
[06:17:43.208 --> 06:17:50.592]  Look at all the people that died and look at how the government is setting on the evidence, obstructing the evidence, hiding and destroying the evidence.
[06:17:50.592 --> 06:17:52.113]  Why aren't people mad about that?
[06:17:52.113 --> 06:17:53.594]  Why aren't they pursuing the truth?
[06:17:53.994 --> 06:17:55.695]  You know, they call us truthers.
[06:17:55.695 --> 06:17:57.215]  I mean, what's the opposite of a truther?
[06:17:57.215 --> 06:17:58.496]  It's a liar.
[06:17:58.496 --> 06:18:00.257]  Why aren't they upset with liars?
[06:18:00.257 --> 06:18:01.857]  Why are they upset with truthers?
[06:18:01.857 --> 06:18:04.138]  Do we have that I'm as mad as hell clip?
[06:18:04.138 --> 06:18:05.819]  Do we have that?
[06:18:05.819 --> 06:18:06.199]  We don't?
[06:18:06.199 --> 06:18:06.659]  Okay.
[06:18:06.659 --> 06:18:08.540]  Well, we'll have to get that at some point.
[06:18:08.540 --> 06:18:09.460]  Maybe I have the movie.
[06:18:09.460 --> 06:18:11.101]  I might go home and get it.
[06:18:11.101 --> 06:18:11.421]  All right.
[06:18:11.421 --> 06:18:13.042]  Thank you for your call, Jim and George.
[06:18:13.042 --> 06:18:13.822]  We're going to move quick.
[06:18:13.822 --> 06:18:16.083]  We only have about 10 minutes or so left.
[06:18:16.083 --> 06:18:17.664]  Let's go to Andrew in Illinois.
[06:18:19.515 --> 06:18:21.857]  I mean, can we see the footage?
[06:18:41.583 --> 06:18:42.846]  Oh, you're right, you're right.
[06:18:42.846 --> 06:18:43.907]  I saw it.
[06:18:43.907 --> 06:18:44.909]  The guy's got a grey backpack.
[06:18:44.909 --> 06:18:46.892]  Those were black backpacks.
[06:18:46.892 --> 06:18:51.340]  So this rabbit trail doesn't even fit the script.
[06:18:51.340 --> 06:18:53.163]  We have some new information there.
[06:18:53.163 --> 06:18:53.904]  No, no, no.
[06:18:53.904 --> 06:18:54.124]  No, no, no.
[06:18:54.810 --> 06:18:55.551]  No, this is war room.
[06:18:55.551 --> 06:18:57.573]  Hey, you want to get a seat and come in here and there?
[06:18:57.573 --> 06:18:58.674]  Hold on, hold on.
[06:18:58.674 --> 06:19:03.680]  I'm going to say this because I've been telling her this all week and David, you can attest to this.
[06:19:03.680 --> 06:19:13.310]  I told Leanne if you don't come in here and just briefly do, you know, just a quick report or just say something, Alex Jones is going to find you in the hall, drag you in here and make you get on.
[06:19:13.310 --> 06:19:13.911]  Did I not?
[06:19:13.911 --> 06:19:14.692]  I've been saying that all week.
[06:19:16.934 --> 06:19:18.435]  Now you're in it.
[06:19:18.435 --> 06:19:22.158]  This is Leanne McAdoo, one of our new reporters here in the Info Wars.
[06:19:22.158 --> 06:19:24.960]  She will be joining us for the next 10 minutes.
[06:19:24.960 --> 06:19:27.841]  Call in and have a question for Leanne ready.
[06:19:27.841 --> 06:19:31.064]  Alright, so we'll move on now to Andrew in Illinois.
[06:19:31.064 --> 06:19:33.185]  Do you have a question for Leanne?
[06:19:33.185 --> 06:19:34.046]  No, I don't.
[06:19:34.046 --> 06:19:39.549]  I just had a comment to check out that they were set up for the Sandy Hook a half hour before the shooting.
[06:19:39.549 --> 06:19:41.711]  They had refreshments.
[06:19:41.711 --> 06:19:44.213]  People are already at the firehouse.
[06:19:44.213 --> 06:19:45.694]  There's a tape on YouTube showing us.
[06:19:48.066 --> 06:19:49.107]  That's how you like to know that.
[06:19:49.107 --> 06:19:51.688]  I'm sorry, could you... Did you get set, Jakar?
[06:19:51.688 --> 06:19:53.290]  Yeah, I'm sorry, we had a little technical difficulty.
[06:19:53.290 --> 06:19:53.930]  Can you repeat?
[06:19:53.930 --> 06:19:55.791]  Hold on, we got double plugs here.
[06:19:55.791 --> 06:19:57.793]  I'm sorry, Andrew, we had to put you on hold.
[06:19:57.793 --> 06:20:00.014]  We have like 10 people talking in here at the same time.
[06:20:05.618 --> 06:20:08.700]  Hang on just one second.
[06:20:08.700 --> 06:20:12.882]  This is live and we're getting Leanne hooked up here so she can hear your comments as well.
[06:20:12.882 --> 06:20:13.482]  So she can comment.
[06:20:13.482 --> 06:20:14.363]  We're getting her in the next one.
[06:20:14.363 --> 06:20:16.724]  Right now she doesn't have any way to hear you.
[06:20:16.724 --> 06:20:20.206]  Okay, so we're working through some technical difficulties.
[06:20:20.206 --> 06:20:22.647]  And then we're going to get you to go back over what you just told us again.
[06:20:22.647 --> 06:20:23.667]  We wanted to hear what you had to say.
[06:20:23.667 --> 06:20:25.988]  Yeah, this is important because when she said it, it clicked.
[06:20:25.988 --> 06:20:27.950]  The backpack's gray, it's not black.
[06:20:27.950 --> 06:20:28.830]  Explain, you got audio now?
[06:20:28.830 --> 06:20:30.651]  Okay.
[06:20:30.651 --> 06:20:32.192]  Can somebody help her with her earpiece?
[06:20:32.192 --> 06:20:32.792]  It's all sticking out.
[06:20:32.792 --> 06:20:33.833]  She's got audio now, you're good.
[06:20:35.652 --> 06:20:36.252]  Okay.
[06:20:36.252 --> 06:20:37.733]  All right.
[06:20:37.733 --> 06:20:42.114]  We'll go back to Andrew in a second, but first, Leanne, make your point about the backpack.
[06:20:42.114 --> 06:20:48.977]  So I was looking, they're playing the footage over and over and over again, and it just struck me that the backpack, it's gray.
[06:20:48.977 --> 06:20:55.419]  It doesn't match all of the photos of the backpacks they've been showing that are black, and they have just one gray stripe.
[06:20:55.419 --> 06:20:57.280]  This is a gray backpack.
[06:20:57.816 --> 06:20:59.838]  You can see it right there if you're watching on InfoWars.com.
[06:20:59.838 --> 06:21:03.820]  They're showing these backpacks that are black or dark colored.
[06:21:03.820 --> 06:21:08.564]  Yeah, and then not only that, but they say they have footage of him setting the backpack down.
[06:21:08.564 --> 06:21:09.925]  Well, I already thought that.
[06:21:09.925 --> 06:21:10.846]  I already thought that.
[06:21:10.846 --> 06:21:13.768]  Plus, the black backpack's not big enough for a pressure cooker.
[06:21:13.768 --> 06:21:15.269]  This is a total rabbit trail.
[06:21:15.269 --> 06:21:20.973]  Yeah, and it doesn't even look like it has anything in the backpack, and he's kind of swinging it around.
[06:21:20.973 --> 06:21:25.316]  I mean, if you had a bomb in your backpack, you would probably have the straps on.
[06:21:25.316 --> 06:21:25.937]  You wouldn't just be
[06:21:26.857 --> 06:21:30.520]  Nonchalantly, just like you didn't have a bomb in your backpack.
[06:21:30.520 --> 06:21:31.141]  Great point.
[06:21:31.141 --> 06:21:31.881]  Great point.
[06:21:31.881 --> 06:21:35.505]  Okay, now we'll go back to Andrew in Illinois and then try to get through the rest of these calls.
[06:21:35.505 --> 06:21:36.846]  Andrew, go ahead.
[06:21:36.846 --> 06:21:40.489]  Okay, I just want to make a mention of a YouTube that's out there now.
[06:21:40.489 --> 06:21:44.012]  It's titled Sandy Hook Conspiracy for Live Drill Live Hooks.
[06:21:44.012 --> 06:21:48.856]  It shows pictures of them being set up a half hour before the event.
[06:21:48.856 --> 06:21:49.617]  Who being set up?
[06:21:49.617 --> 06:21:52.159]  With refreshments and the feds were there already.
[06:21:52.159 --> 06:21:53.200]  This guy witnessed it.
[06:21:54.799 --> 06:21:55.379]  You'll find it.
[06:21:55.379 --> 06:21:56.220]  Look it up that way.
[06:21:56.220 --> 06:21:57.901]  It's a four minute video.
[06:21:57.901 --> 06:21:59.241]  Could you give us the title again?
[06:21:59.241 --> 06:22:00.402]  Yes.
[06:22:00.402 --> 06:22:01.642]  Sandy Hook Conspiracy.
[06:22:01.642 --> 06:22:03.223]  From Live Drill to Live Hoax.
[06:22:03.223 --> 06:22:07.865]  Sandy Hook Only Known Eyewitness Account.
[06:22:07.865 --> 06:22:08.645]  Okay, we'll look at that.
[06:22:08.645 --> 06:22:12.747]  We're looking through some other things, but we'll definitely try to take a look at that.
[06:22:12.747 --> 06:22:18.970]  Also check out the Iroquois Gas Company buying up the land all around there as of 2009.
[06:22:18.970 --> 06:22:22.792]  The researcher found several of the homes vacant that were listed as witness homes.
[06:22:24.296 --> 06:22:28.083]  Okay, we lost I'm sorry Andrew.
[06:22:28.083 --> 06:22:28.303]  Okay.
[06:22:28.303 --> 06:22:30.567]  Thank you for your call Thank you.
[06:22:30.567 --> 06:22:30.787]  Okay.
[06:22:30.787 --> 06:22:31.428]  Thank you.
[06:22:31.428 --> 06:22:32.069]  All right.
[06:22:32.069 --> 06:22:38.079]  We'll move on now to Dave in Colorado Hello, yes, go ahead
[06:22:39.153 --> 06:22:54.401]  Yes, I was watching that newscast that reminded me of that police captain Vance from Sandy Hook, where no information should be taken unless it's from this official outlet, whatever it was.
[06:22:54.401 --> 06:22:58.783]  Absolutely.
[06:22:58.783 --> 06:23:05.166]  I know you guys have gotten tons of pictures, but the SEALs or the security team
[06:23:06.278 --> 06:23:31.871]  If you go to krypton.org, uh, c-r-y-p-t-o-m-e dot org, uh, go to the Boston Blast, and you, bomb blast, and you scroll down about, uh, 21 pictures from there, you'll see them all gathered around an SUV with all sorts of high-tech antennas.
[06:23:31.871 --> 06:23:34.473]  I know you have a lot of calls coming in, I just wanted to get that in.
[06:23:35.484 --> 06:23:36.324]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[06:23:36.324 --> 06:23:37.705]  We'll try to check that out.
[06:23:37.705 --> 06:23:39.305]  Yeah, it's all about sharing information.
[06:23:39.305 --> 06:23:44.046]  We all need to get anything you see, you need to let us know about it, let other people know about it.
[06:23:44.046 --> 06:23:53.468]  Yeah, and we do take these calls seriously because the picture we have on Infowars.com of the guy getting his papers checked, that was a caller who called in on the radio show, so we do get to those when we can.
[06:23:53.468 --> 06:23:54.569]  Thank you for your call, sir.
[06:23:54.569 --> 06:23:58.750]  We'll move on now to Sam in California.
[06:23:58.750 --> 06:24:00.010]  How's it going, fellas?
[06:24:00.010 --> 06:24:01.990]  Very well.
[06:24:01.990 --> 06:24:04.471]  What bothers me here is a little bit of what we're not talking about.
[06:24:05.422 --> 06:24:10.083]  The FBI gets up there and shows us two pictures of guys they need us to find.
[06:24:10.083 --> 06:24:13.304]  I mean, they've got all that money.
[06:24:13.304 --> 06:24:19.586]  They have facial rec, they have fusion centers, they've got DMV and passport photos, they've got cell tracking, they've got satellite tracking.
[06:24:19.586 --> 06:24:23.127]  Like, you're telling me they couldn't go back in real time to the satellite and follow these guys to their front door?
[06:24:23.127 --> 06:24:27.349]  Yeah, that's what I was thinking, because when the guy asked, he said, what happened after the bombs went off?
[06:24:27.349 --> 06:24:30.350]  He said, we saw him walk down the street and we never saw him again.
[06:24:30.350 --> 06:24:34.651]  I thought that was very suspicious, especially for somebody who has the resources of the FBI.
[06:24:35.171 --> 06:24:36.852]  Yeah, did they wait this long to tell us that?
[06:24:36.852 --> 06:24:39.815]  And then they don't really know where these guys went or in their footage.
[06:24:39.815 --> 06:24:42.957]  They didn't know what time the guy had laid packages down.
[06:24:42.957 --> 06:24:44.138]  He says, oh, maybe a couple of minutes.
[06:24:44.138 --> 06:24:49.382]  Did they have enough time to get away from them before the bombs went off if they saw them put packages down?
[06:24:49.382 --> 06:24:53.806]  And they didn't show any pictures of them putting the backpacks down either.
[06:24:53.806 --> 06:24:54.166]  Exactly.
[06:24:55.135 --> 06:25:05.023]  Honestly, even if there was cloud cover and the satellites weren't an option, we could upload their pictures to Facebook and probably facial recommend in under two minutes with social media.
[06:25:05.023 --> 06:25:07.785]  It's such a con and nonsense.
[06:25:07.785 --> 06:25:08.886]  It's exasperating.
[06:25:10.233 --> 06:25:11.894]  It's like, they want you to be involved.
[06:25:11.894 --> 06:25:17.236]  It's like, you know, when you're a little kid and your dad's like, here, come push the lawnmower, and you can't even push it, he has to push it for you.
[06:25:17.236 --> 06:25:19.377]  Well, didn't he say, you're our eyes and ears?
[06:25:19.377 --> 06:25:21.077]  But then he doesn't want us to look at anything else.
[06:25:21.077 --> 06:25:21.278]  Right.
[06:25:21.278 --> 06:25:21.778]  Yeah.
[06:25:21.778 --> 06:25:22.998]  Right?
[06:25:22.998 --> 06:25:25.919]  If they really need our help that bad, we need to fund them completely now.
[06:25:25.919 --> 06:25:27.220]  We just do the job ourselves.
[06:25:27.780 --> 06:25:36.803]  And the other thing I wanted to say, the guy in the picture yesterday with the blue jacket and the red shirt on, he was blatantly the patsy they were setting up to be the NRA guy with the ammo.
[06:25:36.803 --> 06:25:41.084]  But if you look at the guy's face, there's a documentary called The Devil's Breath about scopolamine.
[06:25:41.084 --> 06:25:43.125]  The guy looked like a scopolamine victim.
[06:25:43.125 --> 06:25:45.446]  And it's actually the perfect drug for creating patsies.
[06:25:45.446 --> 06:25:49.347]  I'm sure they've got a hybridized, weaponized version of it that's even more efficient.
[06:25:49.347 --> 06:25:51.548]  But if you go watch the documentary, it explains
[06:25:52.188 --> 06:25:59.755]  It explains every patsy that's ever committed a shooting or a bombing or any nonsense that's been that's been a false flag attempt.
[06:25:59.755 --> 06:26:02.778]  It's Scapoli, the perfect drug for that.
[06:26:02.778 --> 06:26:04.400]  Okay, thank you for your call, sir.
[06:26:04.400 --> 06:26:06.562]  We'll look into that, but we have to keep moving.
[06:26:06.562 --> 06:26:07.523]  Only about five minutes left.
[06:26:07.523 --> 06:26:08.784]  Do you have a comment, David?
[06:26:08.784 --> 06:26:15.490]  I was just gonna say, yeah, that drug is something they can basically blow into your face and you'll follow any suggestion that anybody tells you.
[06:26:15.490 --> 06:26:16.351]  It's pretty amazing, actually.
[06:26:16.531 --> 06:26:19.834]  Okay, we have about six or seven calls left.
[06:26:19.834 --> 06:26:21.235]  Make your point very quickly.
[06:26:21.235 --> 06:26:24.358]  We'll go to Tony in Arizona.
[06:26:24.358 --> 06:26:30.723]  Hi, I just have a comment on the FBI pictures of the backpacks that were exploded.
[06:26:30.723 --> 06:26:39.871]  They have those gray stripes on the straps, the shoulder straps, and that's exactly like the patty guy with the blue shirt.
[06:26:39.871 --> 06:26:44.455]  And he's also holding that very low so that it wouldn't be
[06:26:45.485 --> 06:26:52.927]  Hi, yeah, um, you know, I just want to let you guys know, I mean, last, probably last two or three nights,
[06:27:13.208 --> 06:27:17.775]  We've had, you know, the helicopters flying all over the night.
[06:27:17.775 --> 06:27:19.738]  And I mean, and I know they're military helicopters.
[06:27:19.738 --> 06:27:24.746]  I know the difference between, you know, the regular LAPD helicopters and whatnot.
[06:27:24.746 --> 06:27:26.769]  And they're flying all over the night.
[06:27:26.769 --> 06:27:28.532]  And I noticed the last three or four days,
[06:27:29.420 --> 06:27:33.321]  We've had nothing but police presence all around town.
[06:27:33.321 --> 06:27:37.002]  I mean, you can't go on a street and there is not a cop.
[06:27:37.002 --> 06:27:37.942]  What town are you in, miss?
[06:27:37.942 --> 06:27:38.882]  What town are you in?
[06:27:38.882 --> 06:27:40.503]  I mean, it's all over.
[06:27:40.503 --> 06:27:42.043]  It's creepy almost.
[06:27:42.043 --> 06:27:44.264]  Are you saying you turn to L.A.?
[06:27:44.264 --> 06:27:46.164]  Yeah, I'm in Northridge, but I'm in L.A.
[06:27:46.164 --> 06:27:46.504]  city proper.
[06:27:50.004 --> 06:27:51.285]  And I mean, it's all over.
[06:27:51.285 --> 06:27:58.769]  I mean, you hear them, you know, you hear the choppers at night, you know, they're military, you know, you know, they're not just LAPD helicopters.
[06:27:58.769 --> 06:28:01.010]  And, you know, you see the cops on the street.
[06:28:01.010 --> 06:28:02.251]  I mean, you know.
[06:28:02.251 --> 06:28:02.671]  Yes, miss.
[06:28:02.671 --> 06:28:10.556]  I think the deal is grab your camera, grab your camera, go outside and film it because Joe Biden and these other people are saying that's not happening.
[06:28:10.556 --> 06:28:11.597]  So prove them wrong.
[06:28:11.597 --> 06:28:12.697]  Film it and put it on YouTube.
[06:28:12.697 --> 06:28:14.959]  We have to move quick.
[06:28:14.959 --> 06:28:16.820]  I'm sorry, miss Jason in Tennessee.
[06:28:16.820 --> 06:28:17.100]  Go ahead.
[06:28:18.029 --> 06:28:18.689]  How's it going guys?
[06:28:18.689 --> 06:28:19.290]  Good.
[06:28:19.290 --> 06:28:20.170]  I'll be real quick.
[06:28:20.170 --> 06:28:21.871]  I just wanted to make a comment.
[06:28:21.871 --> 06:28:27.874]  I was actually monitoring Hannity's show to see what they were having to say about everything when the news conference came on.
[06:28:27.874 --> 06:28:31.957]  And he said they're going to cover this thing in its entirety with no commercial breaks.
[06:28:31.957 --> 06:28:37.640]  And as soon as I started hearing Dan Patani speak, they came right back about a minute later.
[06:28:37.640 --> 06:28:38.780]  And then I heard them talking again.
[06:28:38.780 --> 06:28:39.421]  They cut away.
[06:28:39.421 --> 06:28:42.022]  And for the rest of the time, there was nothing there.
[06:28:42.987 --> 06:28:44.068]  Awesome.
[06:28:44.068 --> 06:28:45.789]  Somebody put that on YouTube right now.
[06:28:45.789 --> 06:28:46.530]  Thank you for your call, sir.
[06:28:46.530 --> 06:28:47.751]  We have to move quick.
[06:28:47.751 --> 06:28:51.694]  Chris in Tennessee, excuse me, Chris in Connecticut.
[06:28:51.694 --> 06:28:52.514]  Yes, sir.
[06:28:52.514 --> 06:28:53.275]  Yes, you have a valid...
[06:28:54.142 --> 06:28:54.903]  One minute.
[06:28:54.903 --> 06:28:56.404]  I've got two things to say really quick.
[06:28:56.404 --> 06:29:01.068]  One is, I saw this uploaded video online.
[06:29:01.068 --> 06:29:02.329]  It showed really graphic.
[06:29:02.329 --> 06:29:08.093]  It showed there is some gore in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing.
[06:29:08.093 --> 06:29:10.475]  Thirty seconds.
[06:29:10.475 --> 06:29:11.376]  Go ahead.
[06:29:11.376 --> 06:29:17.081]  One of the officers had walked by and the gore was completely gone, covering some kind of metal object.
[06:29:17.081 --> 06:29:22.825]  And secondly, I just saw 104.1 post up and they were saying it's just a mainstream
[06:29:23.946 --> 06:29:24.507]  We're good.
