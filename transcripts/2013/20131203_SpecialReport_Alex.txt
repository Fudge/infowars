[00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.153]  The deadline for the proposed National Firearms Act is fast approaching.
[00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:08.417]  This will give the ATF more say-so over the transfer of guns in this country.
[00:00:08.757 --> 00:00:13.421]  Some of the bullet points include the government's definition of who a responsible person is.
[00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:22.530]  It would also require all persons in trust to submit photographs and fingerprints and also require all applications to be forwarded to law enforcement.
[00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:32.740]  I find it very troubling that the ATF, an agency involved in Operation Fast and Furious, which supplied guns to Mexican drug cartels, has the authority to tell the U.S.
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.342]  population who a responsible citizen is.
[00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:42.389]  Also, there are proposed regulations for gun trust and also gun corporations, which could affect things like gun suppressors.
[00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:45.051]  Do you think all this new regulation is necessary?
[00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:47.180]  Oh, not at all.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.882]  Basically what you're talking about with suppressors in general, it probably is the most highly regulated item in the firearms market already.
[00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:57.304]  And when you consider that it's really nothing more than a safety device, it's...
[00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.951]  The regulation that's already there could be considered to be kind of ridiculous.
[00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.212]  But there is still time to get involved.
[00:01:03.452 --> 00:01:04.933]  Go to regulations.gov.
[00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:06.954]  You can see the docket number right there on your screen.
[00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:08.855]  Voice your opinion on that page.
[00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.016]  But don't stop there.
[00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.256]  Email the ATF.
[00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:12.237]  Call the ATF.
[00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:14.958]  Show up at their offices and voice your concern for this.
[00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:20.621]  Because this is one of those things that even if we do beat it, and I do believe that we can, they're going to try again and again.
[00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.783]  So stay sober, stay vigilant, and stay on the fight for freedom.
[00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:26.565]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.495]  It's great.

[00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:50.082]  Obama's joker face on the front and come and take it on the back.
[00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:54.184]  It's time to publicly call him out for what he is, a tyrant.
[00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:58.166]  Defend the second amendment with our top seller come and take it t-shirts.
[00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:02.428]  And look at that, women's cut tank tops and t-shirts now available.
[00:02:02.548 --> 00:02:03.028]  Nice hat.
[00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:05.429]  Plus, the Don't Tread On Me flag.
