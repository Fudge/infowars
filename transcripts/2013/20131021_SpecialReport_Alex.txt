[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.270]  Welcome to Tyranny Watch.
[00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.411]  I'm Gigi Ornetta.
[00:00:02.912 --> 00:00:05.234]  Topping our list, Obamacare.
[00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:07.857]  The new tax dressed as health care.
[00:00:08.698 --> 00:00:10.339]  It's insurance, people.
[00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:11.440]  It is not health care.
[00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.402]  When are people going to realize that?
[00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:16.505]  Well, I guess they'll realize it once they can actually log in.
[00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.468]  And here's some intelligence coming from Consumer Reports.
[00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.230]  Stay away from healthcare.gov.
[00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:27.793]  They say to avoid the federal healthcare exchange for at least another month if you can.
[00:00:27.813 --> 00:00:35.516]  271,000 of the 9.47 million people who tried to sign up the first week managed to create an account.
[00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:39.058]  Not actually sign up for healthcare, but create an account.
[00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:43.760]  Keep in mind when you hit the accept button, you're giving up your privacy.
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.201]  It says so right there on terms and conditions.
[00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:52.766]  And your Obamacare comes with free eugenics, completely targeting the Catholics.
[00:00:53.226 --> 00:01:01.293]  The HHS mandate would compel many religious believers and employers to provide abortifacients, contraceptives, and sterilizations to women.
[00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:11.562]  The end result is several Catholic agencies would not qualify for the religious exemption, but they could still be compelled to choose between contracting a plan that does provide the objectionable service or
[00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:14.203]  Paying crippling fines for non-compliance.
[00:01:14.403 --> 00:01:24.246]  As more information comes out about the healthcare.gov website and all of its problems, the question is, are the doctors using the same program to input your medical information?
[00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:27.227]  Because that is one scary thought.
[00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:31.208]  I'm Gigi Ornette for Tyranny Watch on the InfoWars Nightly News.
