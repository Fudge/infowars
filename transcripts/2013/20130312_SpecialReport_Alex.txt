[00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:12.031]  My name is Brian Anderson, and I produced a film called Drone On.
[00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:21.022]  Basis of the film was to figure out what the hell a drone is, and what it isn't, what it can do, what it can't do.
[00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:31.903]  0.99% of drone activity is the weaponized sh** that you see going on throughout the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.
[00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:34.965]  The rest of it is civilian use.
[00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:36.567]  Non-lethal.
[00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:37.788]  My name is Jesse.
[00:00:37.848 --> 00:00:39.269]  I'm with DJI Innovations.
[00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.930]  I'm the lead technician for the company.
[00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.953]  This right here is an introductory type model, good for a beginner.
[00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:46.875]  It's called the Phantom.
[00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.394]  If a robot could take out the trash, that gives me five more minutes to spend with my kid at night.
[00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:53.536]  That would be a good thing.
[00:00:53.596 --> 00:01:00.643]  Of course, we're not looking for the good in robot technology.
[00:01:00.723 --> 00:01:04.046]  We're looking for a way to do harm with it.
[00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:15.490]  If you look at the trajectory of warfare throughout history, you know, when people put down the sword for a gun, folks said, you know, well, there's no honor in that.
[00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.471]  You know, there's no honor in killing someone from a distance.
[00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:24.914]  You know, my personal belief, there really is no honor in killing at all times.
[00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:35.998]  But, you know, remote warfare is just the most recent incarnation of that, like, distance phenomenon in warfare.
[00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:41.540]  We do not have any types of contract with the military or any type of things like that so far.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:55.326]  I believe in defending your country, but, I mean, when it comes to unmanned airplanes striking against targets that we can't really see from hundreds of miles away,
[00:01:57.312 --> 00:01:59.194]  There's gotta be some questions asked about that.
[00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:07.180]  But in terms of them being used, you know, here in the States, I think for surveillance, absolutely.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:17.168]  You know, recently, Christopher Dorner, the fugitive cop in Los Angeles, there was a rumor that started that a drone was going after him to search for him.
[00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.511]  Didn't turn out to be true, but a lot of folks said, you know,
[00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:24.594]  Why wasn't it used to find a guy, you know?
[00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:32.001]  I have a neighbor who is a senior police officer with APD and he asked me about it and I showed it to him.
[00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:32.901]  I flew it for him.
[00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:34.683]  He was very impressed.
[00:02:35.263 --> 00:02:44.311]  He wants me to set up an interview with my boss and so forth to possibly see about getting a contract with the city.
[00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:53.506]  I think it's something that shouldn't not be done, but I also think that foreign drone strikes are probably a little off base, too.
[00:02:53.546 --> 00:03:03.331]  It's like any technology, as it democratizes, you're going to have to confront these problems, or these concerns and these issues, you know, privacy.
[00:03:03.991 --> 00:03:07.833]  You know, a small personal drone that you can buy off the shelf for $300?
[00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:11.065]  That's just a tool.
[00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:14.607]  And there's been issues, too, with people thinking that you could spy with these.
[00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:19.531]  It's bright colored, has flashing lights, and it's loud.
[00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:21.633]  Well, not really loud, but you can hear it.
[00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:26.856]  I can hear it about 30 feet up, so I don't think that'd make a very good spy tool.
[00:03:27.096 --> 00:03:38.765]  I never have privacy concerns because I'm the type of person that says, why am I worried about my privacy if I'm not doing anything in my private life that should set off any red flags?
